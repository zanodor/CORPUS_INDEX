NEW SCIENCE /PHYSICS $14.95
"This important work unifies the realms of science and consciousness in a truly integral 'theory of everything."' Ralph Abraham, Ph.D., professor of mathematics, University of California, and coauthor of Chaos, Creativity, and Cosmic Consciousness
"A seminal book from one of the best thinkers of our time. Ervin Laszlo charts the frontiers to which science is inexorably headed. In years to come people will look back at the amazing foresight of this work." Peter Russell, Fellow of the Institute of Noetic Sciences and the Findhorn Foundation and author of From Science to God
"With extraordinary intellectual clarity, Laszlo provides a vision that links the best of modern science to the wisdom of the great spiritual traditions." Stanislav Grof, M.D., Ph.D., president and founder of the International Transpersonal Association and author of The Holotropic Mind
Mystics and sages have long maintained that there exists an interconnecting cosmic field at the roots of reality that conserves and conveys information, a field known as the Akashic record. Recent discoveries in vacuum physics show that this Akashic field is real and has its equivalent in science's zero-point field that underlies space itself. This field consists of a subtle sea of fluctuating energies from which all things arise: atoms and galaxies, stars and planets, living beings, and even consciousness. This zero-point Akashic-field - or "A-field" is the constant and enduring memory of the universe. It holds the record of all that ever happened on Earth and in the cosmos and relates it to all that is yet to happen. In Science and the Akashic Field philosopher and scientist Ervin Laszlo conveys the essential element of this information field in language that is accessible and clear. From the world of science he confirms our deepest intuitions of the oneness of creation in the Integral Theory of Everything. We discover that, as philosopher William James stated, "We are like islands in the sea, separate on the surface but connected in the deep."
ERVIN LASZLO, holder of the highest degree of the Sorbonne (the State Doctorate), is recipient of four Honorary Ph.D.s and numerous awards and distinctions, including the 2001 Goi Award (the Japan Peace Prize). In 2004 he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize as well as the Templeton Prize. A former professor of philosophy, systems theory, and futures studies in the U.S., Europe, and the Far East, Laszlo is founder and president of the international think tank The Club of Budapest as well as of the General Evolution Research Group. The author of over 400 papers and 74 books translated into 20 languages, he lives in Tuscany.

SCIENCE and the Akashic Field
"Ervin Laszlo presents readers with a tour de force, nothing less than a theory of everything. This book introduces such provocative concepts as the "A-field" and the "informed universe," making the case that a complete understanding of reality is woefully lacking without them. Readers of this book will never view the universe in quite the same way again."
STANLEY KRIPPNER, PH.D.,
PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY, SAYBROOK GRADUATE SCHOOL,
AND AUTHOR AND CO-EDITOR OF VARIETIES OF ANOMALOUS EXPERIENCE
"Over the last 30 years, Ervin Laszlo has consistently been at the forefront of scientific inquiry, exploring the frontiers of knowledge with insight, wisdom and integrity. With Science and the Akashic Field he takes another quantum leap forward in our understanding of the universe and ourselves. This enthralling vision of mind, science, and universe is essential reading for the 21st century."
ALFONSO MONTUORI, PH.D.,
CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF INTEGRAL STUDIES,
AND AUTHOR OF CREATORS ON CREATING
"It is rare indeed that a revolution in thought can open our eyes to a new universe that transforms our inner experience as well as our relationships with others and even with the cosmos. Martin Buber did it with I and Thou. Now, Ervin Laszlo, one of the most profound minds of our generation, has given us a great gift in this readable book that explores how we are connected to each other in fields of resonance that penetrate to the deepest levels of being."
ALLAN COMBS, PH.D.,
PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT ASHEVILLE,
AND AUTHOR OF THE RADIANCE OF BEING



"If you ever wanted to hold the universe in your hand, pick up this book. You can hardly do better than join cosmologist Ervin Laszlo in the ultimate quest: for a theory of everything."
CHRISTIAN DE QUINCEY, PH.D.,
PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY, JOHN F. KENNEDY UNIVERSITY,
EDITOR OF INSTITUTE OF NOETIC SCIENCES' IONS REVIEW,
AND AUTHOR OF RADICAL NATURE: REDISCOVERING THE SOUL OF MATTER
"In this impressive and transformative work Laszlo brings the reader into an integral worldview for our time. The reader who encounters this book will be irrevocably transformed and will henceforth experience the world through a global lens."
ASHOK GANGADEAN, PH.D.,
PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY, HAVERFORD COLLEGE,
FOUNDER-DIRECTOR OF THE GLOBAL DIALOGUE INSTITUTE,
AND AUTHOR OF THE AWAKENING OF THE GLOBAL MIND
"In a visionary way based on profound knowledge of modern science, Laszlo creates a genuine architecture of human and cosmic evolution. He provides the bridge between all the different puzzle-stones of science and unifies them in a most remarkable and bold 'integral theory of everything.'"
FRITZ-ALBERT POPP, PH.D.,
DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOPHYSICS
AND EDITOR OF RECENT ADVANCES IN BIOPHOTON RESEARCH
"This is one of the most important books to be published in the last decades. Ervin Laszlo's Science and the Akashic Field has the power and coherence to explain the major phenomena of cosmos, life, and mind as they occur at the various levels of nature and society. In demonstrating that an information field is a fundamental factor in the universe, Ervin Laszlo catalyzes a radical paradigm-shift in the contemporary sciences."
IGNAZIO MASULLI, PH.D.,
PROFESSOR OF HISTORY, UNIVERSITY OF BOLOGNA, ITALY,
AND COAUTHOR OF THE EVOLUTION OF COGNITIVE MAPS



"Laszlo's book opens the way toward a great synthesis. Whoever reads Laszlo's book witnesses the greatest awakening of the human spirit. Not since Plato and Democritus has there been such a transformation in the history of thought!"
LASZL6 GAZDAG, PH.D.,
PHYSICIST AND PROFESSOR OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, SCIENCE UNIVERSITY OF PECS,
HUNGARY, AND AUTHOR OF BEYOND THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY
"In his admirable 40-year quest for an integral theory of everything, Laszlo has not restricted himself to physics but presented a coherent global hypothesis of connectivity between quantum, cosmos, life and consciousness. I cannot think of anyone else who is better prepared and more able, than the genuine post-modern Renaissance Man Laszlo, to offer a vision that is imaginative, but not imaginary, a vision where all things are connected with all other things and nothing disappears without a trace."
ZEV NAVEH, PH.D.,
PROFESSOR EMERITUS, ISRAEL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,
AND AUTHOR OF LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
"Is everything that ever happened on this earth recorded in some huge, ultra-dimensional information bank? Are some of us occasionally able to tap into it with some facility, and perhaps all of us to some extent now and then during our lives? Science and the Akashic Field provides the pioneering scientific answer to these and many other fundamental questions our species faces at this critical time in human evolution."
DAVID LOYE, P H . D . ,
FORMER RESEARCH DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM ON
PSYCHOSOCIAL ADAPTATION AND THE FUTURE, UCLA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,
AND AUTHOR OF AN ARROW THROUGH CHAOS
"Science and the Akashic Field shows clearly that science is poised at the threshold of a new paradigm. The new vision offers humanity the perspective of more peace and security, not as an idealistic goal but as a reflection of reality."
JURRIAAN KAMP,
EDITOR IN CHIEF OF ODE MAGAZINE
AND AUTHOR OF BECAUSE PEOPLE MATTER



"When in search of impacts or nuances useful in discovering and understanding the essential universe, Ervin Laszlo's brilliant new work, Science and the Akashic Field, surpasses previous explorations. The work opens a road to understanding the universe as an integrated entity, connecting science and consciousness, and recognizing the wholeness of the universe, life, and mind. This is a "make-sense-of-the-complex" opus, accessible to every reader."
A. HARRIS STONE, ED.D.,
FOUNDER OF THE GRADUATE INSTITUTE IN MlLFORD, CONNECTICUT,
AND AUTHOR OF THE LAST FREE BIRD
"There is turmoil and excitement at the cutting edge of cosmology and related sciences. Ervin Laszlo, with his insightful and systems-oriented approach, charts a course through it all that is both truly radical and truly plausible. This is a solidly grounded vision of our cosmos, with perspectives that are wide and deep and have profound implications for all of us."
HENRIK B. TSCHUDI,
CHAIRMAN OF THE FLUX FOUNDATION, OSLO, NORWAY
"Ervin Laszlo is, arguably, the most profound thinker alive today."

Akasha (a-ka 'ska) is a Sanskrit word meaning "ether":
all-pervasive space. Originally signifying "radiation" or
"brilliance," in Indian philosophy akasha was considered
the first and most fundamental of the five elements - the
others being vata (air), agni (fire), ap (water), and
prithivi (earth). Akasha embraces the properties of all
five elements: it is the womb from which everything we
perceive with our senses has emerged and into which
everything will ultimately re-descend. The Akashic
Record (also called The Akashic Chronicle,) is the
enduring record of all that happens, and has ever
happened, in space and time.



Acknowledgments
This book is the fruit of over forty years of seeking a view of the world
that is meaningful as well as embracing, rigorous, and yet simple. I can
not possibly thank by name all the people who have furnished infor
mation to me in my search or, even more important, provided
encouragement and inspiration. Let me mention merely those who have
been most directly instrumental in drafting and completing this, the
most recent and perhaps the most definitive of the nearly half-dozen
books I have devoted to this quest. I begin with my immediate family.
Living with a person who seems obsessed with working out and
communicating an idea is not an easy matter; I am deeply grateful to
my wife, Carita, for putting up with both my absences and my absent
mindedness during the long periods when I was drafting, redrafting,
and elaborating this book. Without her support and constant loving
presence, I could not have had the peace, and the peace of mind, to
undertake this project.
Once again, I dedicate this book to our sons, Christopher and
Alexander, for they continue to remain "plugged in" as I range over
fields as varied as the problems of morality and sustainability in today's
world and the explanation of the strange finding that all things in the
universe are connected with all other things. Their encouragement,
love, and support, unobtrusive yet ever present, has been a major fac
tor in my venturing on terrains where most academics, not to mention
angels, fear to tread. Let me note that Kathia, Alexander's "better half"
and closest collaborator, and Lakshmi, Christopher's spouse and life
companion, are part of this intimate group of comprehension and co
creation.

A special note of thanks is due to my good friend the brilliant
Hungarian physicist Laszlo Gazdag. His pathbreaking theories and rich
background knowledge in avant-garde physics were an invaluable
asset. Another person whose friendship and support were vital to this
undertaking is my Club of Budapest colleague, gifted healer, and life
long friend Maria Sagi. Her practical work in local as well as nonlocal
diagnosing and healing - from which both I and my whole family have
benefited - helped me find the way to the informed universe and gave
me assurance that it is the right one.
There have been numerous friends and colleagues in the academic
community who have followed my work and provided useful, often
vital, information. Many of them have commented on this work prior
to its publication. Let me take this opportunity to express my thanks to
them, and to note that those who are members of the General Evolution
Research Group - among them Allan Combs and David Loye - have
been especially helpful and supportive.
A small but intensely committed group of colleagues who became
friends (although some I have not even met in person) has been instru
mental in editing, producing, and publishing this book. It includes first
of all Bill Gladstone, head of Waterside Productions, whom I have
known for years and who during all this time has steadfastly maintained
that this book is my real intellectual legacy - notwithstanding many
other books he has helped me develop and publish. It has been nearly
five years since we envisaged this project and without his friendly but
decisive insistence that I should "lower the altitude" of its language so
as to make it accessible to a wide public, it would not have been com
pleted in its present, hopefully clear and reader-friendly, form. In this
regard I acknowledge with thanks the expert help of former Random
House editor Peter Guzzardi, who, over a period of well over a year, has
reviewed my successive drafts and offered valuable suggestions.
The team at Inner Traditions International proved to be a major
asset. Well beyond the usual tasks of editors and publishers, the mem
bers of this team, headed by publisher Ehud Sperling, demonstrated the
kind of creativity and commitment that used to be legendary in the pub

environment. I am pleased to acknowledge the vision of acquisitions
editor Jon Graham, who, having had a look at an advance draft of the
manuscript at the 2003 Frankfurt Book Fair, immediately decided that
he wanted to acquire it. It is likewise a pleasure to acknowledge the col
laboration of managing editor Jeanie Levitan, who - in charge of coor
dinating the various steps in the production and publication of this
volume - has been thoroughly committed and heartwarmingly helpful
throughout.
If I left to the last Nancy Yeilding, my copy editor, it is because she
has been the last person with whom I have collaborated in this venture.
When she took the text in her hands, I was fairly convinced that it was
in final shape, save some linguistic touch-ups. But Nancy has done
wonders in restructuring it for improved logic in exposition and
enhanced clarity in language. The text before the reader bears the mark
of her creative ideas - deeply appreciated by its author.

Introduction
There are many ways of comprehending the world: through personal insight, mystical intuition, art, and poetry, as well as the belief systems of the world's religions. Of the many ways available to us, there is one that is particularly deserving of attention, for it is based on repeatable experience, follows a rigorous method, and is subject to ongoing criticism and assessment. It is the way of science.
Science, as a popular newspaper column tells us, matters. It matters not only because it is a source of the new technologies that are shaping our lives and everything around us, but also because it suggests a trustworthy way of looking at the world - and at ourselves in the world.
But looking at the world through the prism of modern science has not been a simple matter. Until recently, science gave a fragmented picture of the world, conveyed through seemingly independent disciplinary compartments. Even scientists have found it difficult to tell what connects the physical universe to the living world, the living world to the world of society, and the world of society to the domains of mind and culture. This is now changing; ever more scientists are searching for a more integrated, more unitary world picture. This is true especially of physicists, who are intensely at work creating "grand unified theories" and "super-grand unified theories." These GUTs and super-GUTs relate together the fundamental fields and forces of nature in a logical and coherent theoretical scheme, suggesting that they had common origins.
A particularly ambitious endeavor has surfaced in quantum physics in recent years: the attempt to create a theory of everything - a "TOE." This project is based on string and superstring theories (so called because in these theories elementary particles are viewed as vibrating
1



2 Introduction
filaments or strings), and it uses sophisticated mathematics and multi
dimensional spaces to produce a single equation that could account for
all the laws of the universe. However, the TOEs of string theorists are
not the definitive answer to the quest for a unitary world picture, for
they are not really theories of every-thing - they are at best theories of
every physical-thing. A genuine TOE would include more than the
mathematical formulas that give a unified expression to the phenomena
studied in this branch of quantum physics; there is more to the universe
than vibrating strings and related quantum events. Life, mind, and cul
ture are part of the world's reality, and a genuine theory of everything
would take them into account as well.
Ken Wilber, who wrote a book with the title A Theory of
Everything, agrees: he speaks of the "integral vision" conveyed by a
genuine TOE. However, he does not offer such a theory; he mainly dis
cusses what it would be like, describing it in reference to the evolution of
culture and consciousness - and to his own theories. An actual, science
based integral theory of everything is yet to be created.
As this book will show, a genuine TOE can be created. Although it
is beyond the string and superstring theories, in the framework of
which physicists attempt to formulate their own super-theory, it is well
within the scope of science itself. The factor required to create a gen
uine TOE is not abstract and abstruse: it is information - information
as a real and effective feature of the universe. Although most of us
think of information as data or what a person knows, physicists and
other empirical scientists are discovering that information extends far
beyond the mind of an individual person or even all people put
together. In fact, it is an inherent aspect of nature. The great mav
erick physicist David Bohm called it "in-formation," meaning a mes
sage that actually "forms" the recipient. In-formation is not a human
artifact, not something that we produce by writing, calculating, speak
ing, and messaging. As ancient sages knew, and as scientists are now
rediscovering, in-formation is produced by the real world and is con
veyed by a fundamental field that is present throughout nature.
When we recognize that "in-formation" (which for the sake of sim



Introduction 3
plicity we shall write as "information") is a real and effective factor in
the universe, we rediscover a time-honored concept - the concept of a
universe that is made up neither of just vibrating strings, nor of sepa
rate particles and atoms, but is instead constituted in the embrace of
continuous fields and forces that carry information as well as energy.
This concept - which is thousands of years old and has cropped up
again and again in the history of thought - merits being known. First,
because the energy- and information-imbued "informed universe" is a
meaningful universe, and in our time of accelerating change and mount
ing disorientation we are much in need of a meaningful view of our
selves and of the world. Second, because understanding the essential
contours of the informed universe does not call for having a back
ground in the sciences; they are readily comprehendible by everyone.
And last but not least, because the informed universe is probably the
most comprehensive concept of the world ever to come from science. It
is, at last, a truly unified concept of cosmos, life, and mind.
Science and the Akashic Field is a nontechnical introduction to the
informed universe, cornerstone of a scientific theory that will grow into
a genuine theory of everything. It describes the origins and the essential
elements of this theory and explores why and how it is surfacing in
quantum physics and in cosmology, in the biological sciences, and in
the new field of consciousness research. It highlights the theory's crucial
feature: the revolutionary discovery that at the roots of reality there is
an interconnecting, information-conserving and information-conveying
cosmic field. For thousands of years, mystics and seers, sages and
philosophers maintained that there is such a field; in the East they called
it the Akashic Field. But the majority of Western scientists considered it
a myth. Today, at the new horizons opened by the latest scientific dis
coveries, this field is being rediscovered. The effects of the Akashic Field
are not limited to the physical world: the A-field (as we shall call it)
informs all livings things - the entire web of life. It also informs our
consciousness.



4 Introduction
THE STRUCTURE OF THIS BOOK
Scientists have often ignored the question of meaning in regard to their theories, considering it a philosophical if not downright metaphysical appendage to their mathematical schemes. This has impoverished the discourse of science and has had a negative impact on society. In chapter 1 we raise the question of meaning in regard to science and discuss the relevance of an up-to-date scientific worldview for our time. The worldview most people consider scientific is an inadequate and in many respects obsolete view. This, however, can be remedied.
Chapter 2 lays the groundwork for an encompassing scientific theory that is both meaningful for laypeople and capable of responding to the problems encountered by scientists. We review the "paradigm-shift" that promises to lead science toward such a theory. The key element is the accumulation of puzzles: anomalies that the current paradigm cannot clarify. This drives the community of scientists to search for a more fertile way of approaching the anomalous phenomena.
Chapter 3 offers a concise catalog of the findings that puzzle scientists in diverse fields of inquiry. This demonstrates the basic fact that evidence for a fundamental insight about reality does not come from a single experiment, or even from a single field of inquiry. If the insight is truly basic, its traces should be encountered in practically all systematic investigations of scientific interest. Our catalog of puzzles shows that this is the case in regard to the unsuspected forms and levels of coherence that come to light in the physical world and in the living world, as well as in the world of mind and consciousness.
In chapter 4 we enter on the quest of identifying nature's information field and building it into the spectrum of scientific knowledge. We explore theories of the quantum vacuum - the zero-point energy field that fills all of cosmic space - and discuss how this intensely researched but as yet incompletely understood cosmic field could convey not only energy, but also information.
Chapter 5 returns to a discussion of the evidence for information in nature, examining in greater detail the puzzles of science and describing



Introduction 5
how innovative scientists attempt to cope with them. A more profound
look at both the evidence and the hypotheses by which the evidence is
interpreted is indicated, since the assertion that an information field
underlies all things in the universe is a major claim and - while it is a
perennial insight of traditional cosmologies - it is a radical innovation
in the eyes of conservative mainstream scientists.
In chapter 6 we go a step further: we present the scientific basis of
the A-field, the cosmic information field. This is the foundation of a
theory that can clarify many of the hitherto puzzling yet fundamental
features of quanta and galaxies, organisms and minds. The resulting
"integral theory of everything" takes information as a fundamental fac
tor in the world. It recognizes that ours is not just a matter- and energy
based universe, but rather an information-based "informed universe."
On first sight the informed universe may appear to be a surprising uni
verse, yet on a deeper look it proves to be familiar - perhaps surpris
ingly familiar. Intuitive people have always known that the real universe
is more than a world of inert, nonconscious matter moving randomly
in passive space.
In chapters 7 and 8 we explore the informed universe. We ask some
of the questions thinking people have always asked about the nature of
reality. Where did the universe come from? Where is it going? Is there
life elsewhere in the wide reaches of the universe? If so, is it likely to
evolve to higher stages or dimensions? We go on to ask questions about
the nature of consciousness. Did it originate with Homo sapiens or is it
part of the fundamental fabric of the cosmos? Will it evolve further in
the course of time - and what kind of impact will it have on our world
when it does?
We probe deeper still. Does human consciousness cease at the phys
ical death of the body or does it continue to exist in some way, in this
or in another sphere of reality? And could it be that the universe itself
possesses some form of consciousness, a cosmic or divine root from
which our consciousness has grown and with which it remains subtly
connected?
The informed universe is a world of subtle but constant



6 Introduction
interconnection, a world where everything informs - acts on and inter
acts with - everything else. This world merits deeper acquaintance; we
should apprehend it with our heart as well as our brain. Chapter 9
speaks to our heart. It offers a vision that is imaginative but not imag
inary: a poetic vision of a universe where nothing disappears without a
trace, and where all things that exist are, and remain, intrinsically and
intimately interconnected.
Science and the Akashic Field has been written to give readers inter
ested in exploring what science can tell us about the world both the
theoretical background necessary to grasp the "theory of everything"
that is now within the reach of avant-garde scientists and an inkling of
the vast vistas opened when this integral theory is queried about the real
nature of cosmos, life, and consciousness.
Come,
sail with me on a quiet pond.
The shores are shrouded,
the surface smooth.
We are vessels on the pond
and we are one with the pond.
A fine wake spreads out behind us,
traveling throughout the misty waters.
Its subtle waves register our passage.
Your wake and mine coalesce,
they form a pattern that mirrors
your movement as well as mine.
As other vessels, who are also us,
sail the pond that is us as well,
their waves intersect with both of ours.
The pond's surface comes alive
with wave upon wave, ripple upon ripple.
They are the memory of our movement;
the traces of our being.



Introduction 7
The waters whisper from you to me and from me to you,
and from both of us to all the others who sail the pond:
Our separateness is an illusion;
we are interconnected parts of the whole
we are a pond with movement and memory.
Our reality is larger than you and me,
and all the vessels that sail the waters,
and all the waters on which they sail.



PART ONE
THE QUEST FOR
AN INTEGRAL THEORY
OF EVERYTHING



10 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
BACKGROUND BRIEF
WHAT ARE THEORIES OF EVERYTHING?
In the contemporary sciences, theories of everything are
researched and developed by theoretical physicists. They
attempt to achieve what Einstein once called "reading the mind
of God." He said that if we could bring together all the laws of
physical nature into a consistent set of equations, we could
explain all the features of the universe on the basis of that equa
tion; that would be tantamount to reading the mind of God.
Einstein's own attempt took the form of a unified field the
ory. Although he pursued this ambitious quest until his death in
1955, he did not find the simple and powerful equation that
would explain all physical phenomena in a logically consistent
form.
The way Einstein tried to achieve his objective was by con
sidering all physical phenomena as the interaction of continuous
fields. We now know that his failure was due to the disregard of
the fields and forces that operate at the microphysical level of
reality: these fields (the weak and the strong nuclear forces) are
central to quantum mechanics, but not to relativity theory.
A different approach has been adopted today by the majority
of theoretical physicists: they take quanta - the discontinuous
aspect of physical reality - as basic. But the physical nature of
quanta is reinterpreted: they are no longer discrete matter
energy particles but rather vibrating one-dimensional filaments:
"strings" and "superstrings." Physicists try to link all the laws
of physics as the vibration of superstrings in a higher dimen
sional space. They see each particle as a string that makes its
own "music" together with all other particles. Cosmically,
entire stars and galaxies vibrate together, as, in the final analy
sis, does the whole universe. The physicists' challenge is to come



The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything 11
up with an equation that shows how one vibration relates to
another, so that they can all be expressed consistently in a single
super-equation. This equation would decode the encompassing
music that is the vastest and most fundamental harmony of the
cosmos.
At the time of writing, a string-theory-based TOE remains an
ambition and a hope: nobody has come up with the super-equa
tion that could express the harmony of the physical universe in
an equation as simple and basic as Einstein's original E = mc2.
Yet the quest for a theory of everything is realistic. Even if an
equation is found that can account for all the laws and constants
of physical nature, a single equation is unlikely to embrace all
the diverse phenomena of the world. But a single conceptual
scheme could do so. And this scheme could be both simple and
meaningful, as we shall see . ..



ONE
A Meaningful Worldview
for Our Time
Meaningfulness in science is an important dimension, even if it is an often neglected one. Science is not only a collection of formulas, abstract and dry, but also a source of insight into the way things are in the world. It is more than just observation, measurement, and computation; it is also a search for meaning and truth. Scientists are concerned with not only the how of the world - the way things work - but also what the things of this world are and why they are the way we find them.
It is indisputable, however, that many, and perhaps the majority, of physical scientists are more concerned with making their equations pan out than with the meaning they can attach to them. There are exceptions. Stephen Hawking is among those keenly interested in explicating the meaning of the latest theories, even though this is not an easy task in physics and cosmology. Shortly after the publication of his A Brief History of Time, a feature story appeared in the New York Times entitled, "Yes Professor Hawking, but what does it mean?" The question was to the point: Hawking's theory of time and the universe is complex, its meaning by no means transparent. Yet Hawking's attempts to make it so are noteworthy, and worthy of being followed up.
Evidently, the search for meaning is not confined to science. It is entirely fundamental for the human mind; it is as old as civilization. For as long as people looked at the sun, the moon, and the starry sky above,

and at the seas, the rivers, the hills, and the forests below, they won
dered where it all came from, where it all is going, and what it all
means. In the modern world, many scientists are technical specialists,
but some among them wonder as well. Theoreticians wonder more than
experimentalists. They often have a deep mystical streak; Newton and
Einstein are prime examples. Some scientists, the physicist David Peat
among them, accept and explicitly acknowledge the challenge of find
ing meaning through science.
"Each of us is faced with a mystery," Peat began his book
Synchronicity. "We are born into this universe, we grow up, work, play,
fall in love, and at the ends of our lives, face death. Yet in the midst of
all this activity we are constantly confronted by a series of overwhelm
ing questions: What is the nature of the universe and what is our posi
tion in it? What does the universe mean? What is its purpose? Who are
we and what is the meaning of our lives?" Science, Peat claims,
attempts to answer these questions, since it has always been the
province of the scientist to discover how the universe is constituted,
how matter was first created, and how life began.
But other scientists do not think that contemporary science has
much to do with questions of meaning. The cosmological physicist
Steven Weinberg is adamant that the universe as a physical process is
meaningless; the laws of physics offer no discernible purpose for human
beings. "I believe there is no point that can be discovered by the meth
ods of science," he said in an interview. "I believe that what we have
found so far - an impersonal universe which is not particularly directed
towards human beings - is what we are going to continue to find. And
that when we find the ultimate laws of nature they will have a chilling,
cold, impersonal quality about them."
This split in the scientists' view about meaning has deep cultural
roots. The historian of civilization Richard Tamas pointed out that
since the dawn of the modern age, the civilization of the Western world
has had two faces. One face is that of progress, the other, of fall. The
more familiar face is the account of a long and heroic journey from a
primitive world of dark ignorance, suffering, and limitation to the



14 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
bright modern world of ever-increasing knowledge, freedom, and well
being, made possible by the sustained development of human reason
and, above all, of scientific knowledge and technological skill. The
other face is the story of humanity's fall and separation from the origi
nal state of oneness with nature and cosmos: while in their primordial
condition humans possessed an instinctive knowledge of the sacred
unity and profound interconnectedness of the world, a deep schism
arose between humankind and the rest of reality with the ascendance of
the rational mind. The nadir of this development is reflected in the cur
rent ecological disaster, moral disorientation, and spiritual emptiness.
Contemporary Western civilization displays both the positive and
the negative faces. Its duality is reflected in the attitude scientists adopt
toward the question of meaning. Some, like Weinberg, express the neg
ative face of Western civilization. For them, meaning resides in the
human mind alone: the world itself is impersonal, without purpose or
intention. Finding meaning in the universe is to make the error of pro
jecting one's own mind and personality into it. Others, like Peat, align
themselves with the positive face. They insist that though the universe
has been disenchanted by modern science, it is re-enchanted in light of
the latest findings.
Science's disenchantment of the world has exacted a high price.
When mind, consciousness, and meaning are seen as uniquely human
phenomena, we humans - purposeful, valuing, feeling beings - find
ourselves in a universe devoid of the very qualities we ourselves possess.
We are strangers in the world in which we have come to be. Our alien
ation from nature opens the way to the blind exploitation of everything
around us. If we arrogate all mind to ourselves, said Gregory Bateson,
we will see the world as mindless and therefore as not entitled to moral
or ethical consideration. "If this is your estimate of your relation to
nature and you have an advanced technology," Bateson added, "your
likelihood of survival will be that of a snowball in hell."
The depressive futility inherent in the negative face of Western civ
ilization has been spelled out by the renowned philosopher Bertrand
Russell: "That man is the product of causes which had no prevision of



A Meaningful Worldview for Our Time 15
the end they were achieving," he wrote, "his hopes and fears, his loves and beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labors of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, and the whole temple of man's achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins - all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand."
But the face of progress need not be so cold, nor the face of fall so tragic. All the things that Russell mentions are not only not "beyond dispute," and not only are they not "nearly certain"; they may be the chimeras of an obsolete view of the world. At its cutting edge, the new cosmology discovers a world where the universe does not end in ruin, and the new physics, the new biology, and the new consciousness research recognize that in this world life and mind are integral elements and not accidental by-products. All these elements come together in the informed universe - a comprehensive and intensely meaningful universe, cornerstone of the unified conceptual scheme that can tie together all the diverse phenomena of the world: the integral theory of everything.

On Puzzles and Fables: The Next
Paradigm Shift in Science
Whatever interpretation of the findings scientists may espouse, they are hard at work mapping ever more of the reality to which their observations and experiments are believed to refer. Scientists are not necessarily sophisticated philosophers, and they do not see the world in its pristine purity anymore than anyone else does. They see the world through their theories - their own conceptions about the segment of the world they investigate. However, these conceptions, unlike the ideas of philosophers and everyone else, are rigorously tested. Established theories "work": they allow scientists to make predictions based on what they observe. When they test their predictions and what they observe corresponds to what they had predicted, they maintain that their theories provide a correct account of how things are in that given segment of the world, what those things are, and why they are the way we actually find them. Thoroughly tested and well-developed theories about life, mind, and the universe could well be, and are even likely to be, humanly meaningful - as we shall see.*
Whether or not scientific theories are humanly meaningful, they are clearly not eternal. Occasionally even the best-established theories break

down - the predictions flowing out of them are not matched by observations. In that case the observations are said to be "anomalous"; they have no ready explanation. Strangely enough, this is the real engine of progress in science. When everything works, there can still be progress, but it is piecemeal progress at best, the refinement of the accepted theory to correspond to further observations and findings. Significant change occurs when this is not possible. Then the point is sooner or later reached when - instead of trying to stretch the established theories scientists prefer to look for a simpler and more insightful theory. The way is open to fundamental theory innovation: to a paradigm shift. The shift is driven by the accumulation of observations that do not fit the accepted theories and cannot be made to fit by the simple extension of those theories. The stage may be set for a new and more adequate scientific paradigm, but that paradigm must first be discovered.
There are stringent requirements for any new paradigm. A theory based on it must enable scientists to explain all the findings covered by the previous theory, and must also explain the anomalous observations. It must integrate all the relevant facts in a simpler yet more encompassing and powerful concept. This is what Einstein did at the turn of the twentieth century when he stopped looking for solutions to the puzzling behavior of light in the framework of Newtonian physics and created instead a new concept of physical reality: the theory of relativity. As he himself said, one cannot solve a problem with the same kind of thinking that gave rise to that problem. In a surprisingly short time, the bulk of the physics community abandoned the classical physics founded by Newton and embraced Einstein's revolutionary concept in its place. In the first decade of the twentieth century, science underwent a basic "paradigm shift." Now, in the first decade of the twenty-first century, puzzles and anomalies are accumulating again in many disciplines, and science faces another paradigm shift, very likely just as fundamental as the revolution that shifted science from the mechanistic world of Newton to the relativistic universe of Einstein.
The current paradigm shift has been brewing in the avant-garde circles of science for some time. Scientific revolutions are not instant-fit



18 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
processes, with a new theory clicking into place all at once. They may be
rapid, as in the case of Einstein's theory, or more protracted, as the shift
from the classical Darwinian theory to a more systemic post-Darwinian
conception in biology, for example. Before such revolutions are consoli
dated, the sciences affected by them go through a period of turbulence.
Mainstream scientists defend the established theories, while maverick
scientists at the cutting edge explore alternatives. The latter come up
with new, sometimes radically different ideas that look at the same phe
nomena the mainstream scientists look at but see them differently. For a
time, the alternative conceptions - initially in the form of working
hypotheses - seem strange if not actually fantastic. They are something
like fables, dreamt up by imaginative investigators. Yet they are not the
work of untrammeled imagination. The "fables" of serious investigators
are based on rigorous reasoning, bringing together what is already
known about the segment of the world researched in a given discipline
with what is as yet puzzling about it. And they are testable, capable of
being confirmed or proved false by observation and experiment.
Investigating the anomalies that crop up in observation and experi
ment and coming up with the fables that could account for them make up
the nuts and bolts of fundamental research in science. If the anomalies per
sist despite the best efforts of mainstream scientists, and if one or another
of the fables advanced by maverick investigators gives a simpler and more
logical explanation, a critical mass of scientists (mostly young ones) stops
standing by the old paradigm. We have a paradigm shift. A concept that
was until then a fable is recognized as a valid scientific theory.
There are countless examples of successful as well as of failed fables
in the sciences. Confirmed fables - presently valid even if not eternally
true scientific theories - include Charles Darwin's concept that all living
species descended from common ancestors and Alan Guth's and Andrei
Linde's hypothesis that the universe originated in a superfast "infla
tion" following its explosive birthing in the Big Bang. Failed fables
those that turn out not to be an exact, or at any rate the best,
explanation of the pertinent phenomena - include Hans Driesch's
notion that the evolution of life follows a preestablished plan in a goal



On Puzzles and Fables 19
guided process called entelechy and Einstein's own hypothesis that an
additional physical force, called the cosmological constant, keeps the
universe from collapsing under the pull of gravitation. (Interestingly, as
we shall see, some of these theories are being questioned again: it may
be that Guth's and Linde's "inflation theory" will be replaced by the
more encompassing concept of a cyclical universe, and that Einstein's
cosmological constant was not mistaken after all . . .)
TWO WIDELY DISCUSSED PHYSICS FABLES
Here, by way of example, are two imaginative working
hypotheses - "scientific fables" - put forward by well-respected
physicists. Both have received attention well beyond the physics
community, yet both are entirely mind-boggling as descriptions
of the real world.
10100 UNIVERSES
In 1955 the physicist Hugh Everett advanced the fabulous expla
nation of the quantum world that was subsequently the basis for
Timeline, one of Michael Crichton's best-selling novels. Everett's
"parallel universes hypothesis" refers to a puzzling finding in
quantum physics: that as long as a particle is not observed, meas
ured, or interacted with in any way, it is in a curious state that is
the superposition of all its possible states. When, however, the
particle is observed, measured, or subjected to an interaction, this
state of superposition becomes resolved: the particle is then in a
single state only, like any "ordinary" thing. Because the state of
superposition is described in a complex wave function associated
with the name of Erwin Schrodinger, when the superposed state
resolves it is said that the Schrodinger wave function "collapses."
The rub is that there is no way to tell which of its possible
states the particle will then occupy. The particle's choice seems
to be indeterminate - entirely independent of the conditions



20 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
that trigger the wave function's collapse. Everett's hypothesis
claims that the indeterminacy of the wave function's collapse
does not reflect actual conditions in the world. There is no
indeterminacy involved here: each state occupied by the parti
cle is deterministic in itself - it simply takes place in a world of
its own!
This is how the collapse would occur: When a quantum is
measured, there are a number of possibilities, each of which is
associated with an observer or a measuring device. We perceive
only one of these possibilities in a seemingly random process of
selection. But, according to Everett, the selection is not random,
for it does not take place in the first place: all possible states of
the quantum are realized every time it is measured or observed;
they are just not realized in the same world. The many possible
states of the quantum are realized in as many universes.
Suppose that when it is measured, a quantum such as an elec
tron has a fifty percent probability of going up and a fifty per
cent probability of going down. Then we do not have just one
universe in which the quantum has a 50/50 probability of going
up or going down, but two parallel universes. In one of the uni
verses the electron is actually going up and in the other it is actu
ally going down. We also have an observer or a measuring
instrument in each of these universes. The two outcomes exist
simultaneously in the two universes, and so do the observers or
measuring instruments.
Of course, there are not just two, but rather a vast number of
possible states that a particle can occupy when its multiple super
posed states resolve into a single state. Consequently, a vast num
ber of universes must exist - perhaps of the order of
10100 - complete with observers and measuring instruments. Since
we are not aware of any universe other than the one we observe,
these universes must be separate, isolated from one another.



On Puzzles and Fables 21
THE HOLOGRAPHIC UNIVERSE
The more recent "holographic universe hypothesis" advanced by
particle physicists likewise boggles the mind. It claims that the
entire universe is a hologram - or, at least, that it can be treated
as such. Holograms, we should note, are three-dimensional rep
resentations of objects recorded with a special technique. A
holographic recording consists of the pattern of interference cre
ated by two beams of light. (Currently, monochromatic lasers
and semitransparent mirrors are used for this purpose.) Part of
the laser light passes through the mirror and part is reflected and
bounced off the object to be recorded. A photographic plate is
exposed with the interference pattern created by the light
beams. This is a two-dimensional pattern and it is not meaning
ful in itself; it is merely a jumble of lines. Nonetheless, it con
tains information on the contours of the object. These contours
can be re-created by illuminating the plate with laser light. The
patterns recorded on the photographic plate reproduce the inter
ference pattern of the light beams, so that a visual effect appears
that is identical to the 3-D image of the object. This image
appears to float above and beyond the photographic plate, and
it shifts according to the angle at which one views it.
The idea behind the holographic universe hypothesis is that all
the information that constitutes the universe is stored on its periph
ery, which is a two-dimensional surface. This two-dimensional
information reappears inside the universe in three dimensions.
We see the universe in three dimensions even though what
makes it what it is, is a two-dimensional pattern. Why is this
outlandish idea the subject of intense discussion and research?
The problem the holographic universe concept addresses
comes from thermodynamics. According to its solidly established
second law, disorder can never decrease in any closed system.
This means that disorder cannot decrease in the universe as a



22 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
whole because when we take the cosmos in its totality, it is a
closed system: there is no "outside" and hence nothing to which
it could be open. If disorder cannot decrease, order - which can
be represented as information - cannot increase. According to
quantum theory, the information that creates or maintains order
must be constant; it not only cannot increase, but it also cannot
diminish or vanish.
But what happens to information when matter collapses into
black holes? It would seem that black holes wipe out the infor
mation contained in matter. In response to this riddle, Stephen
Hawking, of Cambridge University, and Jacob Bekenstein, then
of Princeton University, worked out that disorder in a black hole
is proportional to its surface area. Within the black hole there is
a great deal more room for order and information than at its
surface. In a single cubic centimeter, for example, there is room
for 1 0 " Planck volumes inside, but room for only 1066 bits of
information on the surface (a Planck volume is a space bounded
by sides that measure 10- 35 meter - an almost inconceivably
small space). Now, when matter implodes into a black hole, an
enormous chunk of information within the black hole seems to
be wiped out. Hawking was ready to affirm that this is so, but
this would fly in the face of quantum theory's assertion that in
the universe, information can never be lost. The way out of this
dilemma surfaced in 1993 when, working independently,
Leonard Susskind, of Stanford University, and Gerard 't Hooft,
of the University of Utrecht, came up with the idea that infor
mation inside the black hole is not lost if it is stored holograph
ically on its surface.
The mathematics of holograms found unexpected application
in 1998, when Juan Maldacena, then at Harvard University,
tried to account for string theory under conditions of quantum
gravity. Maldacena found that it is easier to deal with strings in
five-dimensional spaces than in four dimensions. (We experience



On Puzzles and Fables 23
space in three dimensions: two planes along the surface and one
up and down. A fourth dimension would be in a direction per
pendicular to these, but this dimension cannot be experienced.
Mathematicians can add any number of further dimensions, fur
ther and further removed from the world of experience.) The
solution seemed evident: assume that the five-dimensional space
inside the black hole is really a hologram of a four-dimensional
pattern on its surface. One can then do the calculations in the
more manageable five dimensions while dealing with a space of
four dimensions.
Would this dimensional reduction work for the universe as a
whole? String theorists are struggling with many extra dimen
sions, having discovered that three-dimensional space is not
enough to accomplish their quest to come up with an equation
that relates the vibrations of the various strings of the universe.
Not even a four-dimensional space-time continuum will work.
Initially TOEs required up to twenty dimensions to relate all
vibrations together in a consistent cosmic harmony. Today scien
tists find that ten or eleven dimensions would suffice, provided
that the vibrations occur in a higher-dimensional "hyperspace."
The holographic principle - as the holographic universe hypothe
sis came to be known - would help: they could assume that the
entire universe is a many-dimensional hologram, conserved in a
smaller number of dimensions on its periphery.
The holographic principle may make string theory's calcula
tions easier, but it makes truly fabulous assumptions about the
nature of the world. (We should add that Gerard 't Hooft, one
of the originators of this principle, later changed his mind about
its cogency. Rather than a "principle," he said, in this context
holography is actually a "problem." Perhaps, he speculated,
quantum gravity could be derived from a deeper principle that
does not obey quantum mechanics.)



24 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
In periods of scientific revolution, when the established paradigm is
increasingly under pressure, the fables of cutting-edge researchers
acquire particular importance. Some remain fabulous, but others
harbor the seeds of significant scientific advance. Initially, nobody
knows for sure which of the seeds will grow and bear fruit. The field is
in ferment, in a state of creative chaos. This is the case today in a
remarkable variety of scientific disciplines. A growing number of anom
alous phenomena are coming to light in physical cosmology, in quan
tum physics, in evolutionary and quantum biology, and in the new field
of consciousness research. They create growing uncertainties and
induce open-minded scientists to look beyond the bounds of the estab
lished theories. While conservative investigators insist that the only
ideas that can be considered scientific are those published in established
science journals and reproduced in standard textbooks, maverick
researchers look for fundamentally new concepts, including some that
were considered beyond the pale of their discipline but a few years ago.
As a result, the world in a growing number of disciplines is turning
more and more fabulous. It is furnished with dark matter, dark energy,
and multidimensional spaces in cosmology, with particles that are
instantly connected throughout space-time by deeper levels of reality in
quantum physics, with living matter that exhibits the coherence of
quanta in biology, and with space- and time-independent transpersonal
connections in consciousness research - to mention but a few of the
currently advanced "fables."
Even if we do not yet know which of the fables put forward today
will become accepted scientific theory tomorrow, we can already tell
what kind of fable is likely to make it. The most promising fables have
shared characteristics. In addition to being innovative and logical, they
address the principal kinds of anomalies in a fundamentally new and
meaningful way.
The principal kinds of anomalies today are anomalies of coherence
and correlation. Coherence is a well-known phenomenon in physics: in
its ordinary form, it refers to light as being composed of waves that
have a constant difference in phase. Coherence means that phase rela



On Puzzles and Fables 25
tions remain constant and processes and rhythms are harmonized. Ordinary light sources are coherent over a few meters; lasers, microwaves, and other technological light sources remain coherent for considerably greater distances. But the kind of coherence discovered today is more complex and remarkable than the standard form, indicating a quasi-instant tuning together of the parts or elements of a system, whether that system is an atom, an organism, or a galaxy. All parts of a system of such coherence are so correlated that what happens to one part also happens to the other parts.
Investigators in a growing number of scientific fields are encountering this surprising form of coherence, and the correlation that underlies it. These phenomena crop up in disciplines as diverse as quantum physics, cosmology, evolutionary biology, and consciousness research and they point toward a previously unknown form and level of unity in nature. The discovery of this unity is at the core of the next paradigm shift in science. This is a remarkable development, for the new paradigm as we shall see - offers the best-ever basis for creating the long sought but hitherto unachieved integral theory of everything.

A Concise Catalog
of Contemporary Puzzles
Before embarking on the search for an integral TOE, we should review
the puzzles that are emerging in the pertinent fields of the sciences. We
should be familiar with the unexpected and often strange findings that
stress the current theories of the physical world, the living world, and
the world of human consciousness, for only then can we understand
the concepts that not only shed light on one or the other of these per
sistent domains of mystery, but also address the elements they have in
common - and thus give us a new, more integral understanding of
nature, mind, and universe.*
1. THE PUZZLES OF COSMOLOGY
Cosmology, a branch of the astronomical sciences, is in turbulence. The
deeper the new high-powered instruments probe the far reaches of the
universe, the more mysteries they uncover. For the most part, these mys
teries have a common element: they exhibit a staggering coherence
throughout the reaches of space and time.

THE SURPRISING WORLD OF THE NEW COSMOLOGY
THE PRINCIPAL LANDMARK: THE COHERENTLY STRUCTURED AND EVOLVING COSMOS
The universe is far more complex and coherent than anyone
other than poets and mystics have dared to imagine. A number
of puzzling observations have cropped up:
• The "flatness" of the universe: in the absence of matter,
space-time turns out to be "flat" or "Euclidean" (the kind of
space where the shortest distance between two points is a
straight line), rather than curved (where the shortest distance
between any two points is a curve). This, however, means
that the "Big Bang" that gave rise to our universe was stag
geringly finely tuned, for if it had produced just one-billionth
more or one-billionth less matter than it did, space-time
would be curved even in the absence of matter.
• The "missing mass" of the universe: there is more gravita
tional pull in the cosmos than visible matter can account
for - yet only matter is believed to have mass and thus to
exert the force of gravitation. Even when cosmologists allow
for a variety of "dark" (optically invisible) matter, there is
still a great chunk of matter (and hence mass) missing.
• The accelerating expansion of the cosmos: distant galaxies
pick up speed as they move away from each other - yet they
should be slowing down as gravitation brakes the force of the
Big Bang that blew them apart.
• The coherence of some cosmic ratios: the mass of elementary
particles, the number of particles, and the forces that exist
between them are all mysteriously adjusted to favor certain
ratios that recur again and again.



28 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
• The "horizon problem": the galaxies and other macrostruc
tures of the universe evolve almost uniformly in all directions
from Earth, even across distances so great that the structures
could not have been connected by light, and hence could not
have been correlated by signals carried by light (according to
relativity theory, no signal can travel faster than light).
• The fine-tuning of the universal constants: the key parame
ters of the universe are amazingly fine tuned to produce not
just recurring harmonic ratios, but also the - otherwise
extremely improbable - conditions under which life can
emerge and evolve in the cosmos.
According to the standard model of cosmic evolution, the universe
originated in the Big Bang, twelve to fifteen billion years ago (the latest
satellite-based observations, made from the far side of the moon, con
firm that the universe is indeed about 13.7 billion years old). The Big
Bang was an explosive instability in the "pre-space" of the universe, a
fluctuating sea of virtual energies known by the misleading term
vacuum. A region of this vacuum - which was, and is, far from a real
vacuum, that is, empty space - exploded, creating a fireball of stagger
ing heat and density. In the first milliseconds it synthesized all the mat
ter that now populates cosmic space. The particle-antiparticle pairs that
emerged collided with and annihilated each other, and the one billionth
of the originally created particles that survived (the tiny excess of par
ticles over antiparticles) made up the material content of this universe.
After about 200,000 years, the particles decoupled from the radiation
field of the primordial fireball, space became transparent, and clumps
of matter established themselves as distinct elements of the cosmos.
Matter in these clumps condensed under gravitational attraction: the
first stars appeared about 200 million years after the Big Bang. In the
space of one billion years, the first galaxies were formed.
Until quite recently, the scenario of cosmic evolution seemed well



A Concise Catalog of Contemporary Puzzles 29
established. Detailed measurements of the cosmic microwave back
ground radiation - the presumed remnant of the Big Bang - testify that
its variations derive from minute fluctuations within the cosmic fireball
when our universe was less than one trillionth of a second "young" and
are not distortions caused by radiation from stellar bodies.
However, the standard cosmology of the Big Bang is not as estab
lished now as it was a few years ago. There is no reasonable explana
tion in "BB theory" for the observed flatness of the universe; for the
missing mass in it; for the accelerating expansion of the galaxies; for the
coherence of some basic cosmic ratios; and for the "horizon problem,"
the uniformity of the macrostructures throughout cosmic space. The
problem known as the "tuning of the constant" is particularly vexing.
The three dozen or more physical parameters of the universe are so
finely tuned that together they create the highly improbable conditions
under which life can emerge on Earth (and presumably on other suit
able planetary surfaces) and then evolve to progressively higher levels
of complexity. These are all puzzles of coherence, and they raise the
possibility that this universe did not arise in the context of a random
fluctuation of the underlying quantum vacuum. Instead, it may have
been born in the womb of a prior "meta-universe": a Metaverse. (The
term meta comes from classical Greek, signifying "behind" or
"beyond," in this case meaning a vaster, more fundamental universe
that is behind or beyond the universe we observe and inhabit.)
The existence of a vaster, perhaps infinite universe is underscored
by the astonishing finding that no matter how far and wide high
powered telescopes range in the universe, they find galaxy after
galaxy - even in "black regions" of the sky where no galaxies or stars
of any kind were believed to exist. This picture is a far cry from the con
cept that reigned in astronomy but a hundred years ago. At that time,
and until the 1920s, it was thought that the Milky Way was all there is
to the universe: where the Milky Way ends, space itself ends. Not only
do we know today that the Milky Way - "our galaxy" - is but one
among billions of other galaxies in "our universe," but we are also
beginning to recognize that the boundaries of "our universe" are not



30 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
the boundaries of "the universe." The cosmos may be infinite in time,
and perhaps also in space - it is vaster by several magnitudes than any
cosmologist would have dared to dream just a few decades ago.
Today a number of physical cosmologies offer quantitatively elab
orated accounts of how the universe we inhabit could have arisen in the
framework of a Metaverse. The promise of such cosmologies is that
they may overcome the puzzles of coherence in this universe, including
the mind-blowing serendipity that it is so improbably finely tuned that
we can be here to ask questions about it. This has no credible explana
tion in a one-shot, single-cycle universe, for there the pre-space fluctu
ations that set the parameters of the emerging universe must have been
randomly selected: there was "nothing there" that could have biased
the serendipity of this selection. Yet a random selection from among all
the possible fluctuations in the chaos of a turbulent pre-space is astro
nomically unlikely to have led to a universe where living organisms and
other complex and coherent phenomena could arise and evolve!
The fluctuations that led to our amazingly coherent universe may
not have been selected at random. Traces of prior universes could have
been present in the pre-space from which our universe arose. They
could have reduced the range of the fluctuations that affected the explo
sion that created our universe, fine-tuning the fluctuations to those that
lead to a universe that can give rise to complex systems, such as those
required for life. In this way the Metaverse could have informed the
birth and evolution of our universe, much as the genetic code of our
parents informed the conception and growth of the embryo that grew
into what we are today.
The staggering coherence of our universe tells us that all its stars
and galaxies are interconnected in some way. And the astonishing fine
tuning of the physical laws and constants of our universe suggests that
at its birth our universe may have been connected with prior universes
in a vaster, perhaps infinite Metaverse.
Do we come across here the footprint of a cosmic "Akashic
Field" that conveyed the trace of a precursor universe to the



A Concise Catalog of Contemporary Puzzles 31
birth of our universe - and has been connecting and correlating
the stars and galaxies of this universe ever since?
2. THE PUZZLES OF QUANTUM PHYSICS
In the course of the twentieth century, quantum physics - the physics of
the ultrasmall domain of physical reality - became strange beyond
imagination. The discoveries show that the smallest identifiable units of
matter, force, and light are actually made up of energy, but not a con
tinuous flow of energy: they always come in distinct packets known as
quanta. These energy packets are not material, although they can have
matterlike properties such as mass, gravitation, and inertia. They seem
like objects, but they are not ordinary, commonsense objects: they are
both corpuscles and waves. When one of their properties is measured,
the others become unavailable to measurement and observation. And
they are instantly and nonenergetically "entangled" with each other no
matter how far apart they may be.
At the quantum level, reality is strange and it is nonlocal: the whole
universe is a network of time- and space-transcending interconnection.
THE WEIRD WORLD OF THE QUANTUM
THE PRINCIPAL LANDMARK: THE ENTANGLED PARTICLE
• In their pristine state, quanta are not just in one place at one
time: each single quantum is both "here" and "there" - and
in a sense it is everywhere in space and time.
• Until they are observed or measured, quanta have no definite
characteristics but instead exist simultaneously in several
states at the same time. These states are not "real" but
"potential" - they are the states the quanta can assume when
they are observed or measured. (It is as if the observer, or the



32 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
measuring instrument, fishes the quanta out of a sea of pos
sibilities. When a quantum is pulled out of that sea, it
becomes a real rather than a mere virtual beast - but one can
never know in advance just which of the various real beasts
it could become it actually will become. It appears to choose
its real states on its own.)
Even when the quantum is in a set of real states, it does not
allow us to observe and measure all of these states at the
same time: when we measure one of its states (for example,
position or energy), another becomes blurred (such as its
speed of motion or the time of its observation).
Quanta are highly sociable: once they are in the same state,
they remain linked no matter how far they travel from each
other. When one of the formerly connected quanta is sub
jected to an interaction (that is, when it is observed or meas
ured), it chooses its own state - and its twin also chooses its
own state, but not freely: it chooses it according to the choice
of the first twin. It always chooses a complementary state,
never the same one.
Within a complex system (such as the whole setup of an
experiment), quanta exhibit just as sociable behaviors. If we
measure one of the quanta in the system, the others become
"real" (that is, similar to a commonsense object) as well. Even
more remarkably, if we create an experimental situation
where a given quantum can be individually measured, all the
other quanta become "real" even if the experiment is not car
ried o u t . . .
Classical mechanics, the physics of Isaac Newton, conveyed a com
prehensible concept of physical reality. Newton's Philosophiae
Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, demonstrated
with geometrical precision that material bodies move according to



A Concise Catalog of Contemporary Puzzles 33
mathematically expressible rules on Earth, while planets rotate in accordance with Kepler's laws in the heavens. The motion of all things is rigorously determined by the conditions under which it is initiated, just as the motion of a pendulum is determined by its length and its initial displacement and that of a projectile by its launch angle and acceleration. With mathematical certainty Newton predicted the position of the planets, the motion of pendulums, the path of projectiles, and the motion of the "mass points" that in his physics are the ultimate building blocks of the universe.
Somewhat over a hundred years ago, the mechanistic, predictable world of Newton ran into trouble. With the splitting of the atom in the late nineteenth century and of the atomic nucleus in the early twentieth, more had been fragmented than a physical entity. The very foundation of natural science was shaken: the experiments of early-twentiethcentury physics demolished the prevailing view that all of reality is built of blocks that are themselves not further divisible. Yet physicists could not put any comparably commonsensical concept in its place. The very notion of "matter" became problematic. The subatomic particles that emerged when atoms and atomic nuclei were fissioned did not behave like conventional solids: they had a mysterious interconnection known as "nonlocality," and a dual nature consisting of wavelike as well as corpuscle-like properties. In addition, the famous "EPR" experiment (the experiment originally suggested by Albert Einstein together with colleagues Boris Podolski and Nathan Rosen) demonstrated that particles that at one time shared the same system of coordinates remain instantly and enduringly correlated. Such correlation extends to entire atoms: current "teleportation" experiments show that when one of a pair of correlated atoms is further correlated with a third atom, the quantum state of the third is instantly transferred ("beamed") to the other of the initially correlated pair - no matter how far away that atom may be. . . .
The remarkable fact emerging from this sea of quantum mystery is that particles and atoms are not individual beasts. They are sociable entities, and under certain conditions they are so thoroughly "entangled"



34 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
with each other that they are not just here or there, but in all pertinent
places at the same time. Their nonlocality respects neither time nor
space: it exists whether the distance that separates the particles and the
atoms is measured in millimeters or in light-years, and whether the time
that separates them consists of seconds or of millions of years.
Could the nonlocality of the most basic elements of the universe
be due to a fundamental field that records the state of particles
and atoms and conveys this information to particles and atoms
in corresponding states? Could it be that an Akashic Field is
active not only at the cosmological scale, but also at the ultra
small scale of physical reality?
3. THE PUZZLES OF BIOLOGY
The superlarge as well as the ultrasmall domains of physical reality turn
out to be amazingly correlated and coherent. But the world in its every
day dimension is more reasonable. Here things occupy but one state at
a time and are either here or there and not in both places simultane
ously. This, at any rate, is the commonsense assumption, but in regard
to living beings, it turns out not to be true. This is surprising, for the
living organism is made up of cells, which are made up of molecules,
which in turn are made up of atoms, made up of particles. And even if
particles themselves are weird, the whole made up of them should be a
classical, commonsense object: one would expect that quantum inde
terminacies would be canceled out at the macroscale.
But in the living world, macroscale objects are not classical - or not
entirely so. Instant, multidimensional correlations are coming to light
between the parts of a living organism, and even between organisms
and environments. Cutting-edge research in quantum biology finds that
atoms and molecules in the organism, and even entire organisms and
their environments, are nearly as "entangled" as microparticles that
originate in the same quantum state.



A Concise Catalog of Contemporary Puzzles 35
THE UNEXPECTED WORLD OF POST-DARWINIAN BIOLOGY
THE PRINCIPAL LANDMARK: THE SUPER-COHERENT ORGANISM
The living organism is extraordinarily coherent: all its parts
are multidimensionally, dynamically, and almost instantly
correlated with all other parts. What happens to one cell or
organ also happens in some way to all other cells and
organs - a correlation that recalls (and in fact suggests) the
kind of "entanglement" that characterizes the behavior of
quanta in the microdomain.
The organism is also coherent with the world around it: what
happens in the external milieu of the organism is reflected in
some ways in its internal milieu. Thanks to this coherence,
the organism can evolve in tune with its environment. The
genetic makeup of even a simple organism is so complex, and
its "fit" to the milieu so delicate, that in the absence of such
"inside-outside tuning," living species could not mutate into
a viable form before being eliminated by natural selection.
That our world is not populated solely by the simplest of
organisms, such as bacteria and blue-green algae, is due in
the last analysis to the kind of "entanglement" that exists
among genes, organisms, organic species, and their niches
within the biosphere.
That the living organism is coherent as a whole is not surprising
what is surprising is the degree and form of its coherence. The organ
ism's coherence goes beyond the coherence of a biochemical system; in
some respects it attains the coherence of a quantum system.
Evidently, if living organisms are not to succumb to the constraints



36 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
of the physical world, their component parts and organs must be pre
cisely yet flexibly correlated with each other. Without such correlation,
physical processes would soon break down the organization of the liv
ing state, bringing it closer to the inert state of thermal and chemical
equilibrium in which life as we know it is impossible. Near-equilibrium
systems are largely inert, incapable of sustaining processes such as
metabolism and reproduction, essential to the living state. An organism
is in thermodynamic equilibrium only when it is dead. As long as it is
living, it is in a state of dynamic equilibrium in which it stores energy
and information and has them available to drive and direct its vital
functions.
On closer analysis it turns out that dynamic equilibrium requires a
very high degree of coherence: it calls for instantaneous long-range cor
relations throughout the system. Simple collisions among neighboring
molecules - mere billiard-ball push-impact relations among them
must be complemented by a network of instant communication that
correlates all parts of the living system, even those that are distant from
one another. Rare molecules, for example, are seldom contiguous, yet
they find each other throughout the organism. There would not be suf
ficient time for this to occur by a random process of jiggling and mix
ing; the molecules need to locate and respond to each other specifically,
even if they are distant. It is difficult to see how this could be achieved
by mechanical or chemical connections among the organism's parts,
even if correlated by a nervous system that reads biochemical signals
from genes through DNA, RNA, proteins, enzymes, and neural trans
mitters and activators.
In a complex organism the challenge of order is gigantic. The
human body consists of some million billion cells, far more than stars
in the Milky Way galaxy. Of this cell population, 600 billion are dying
and the same number are regenerating every day - over 10 million cells
per second. The average skin cell lives only for about two weeks; bone
cells are renewed every three months. Every ninety seconds millions of
antibodies are synthesized, each from about twelve hundred amino
acids, and every hour 200 million erythrocytes are regenerated. There



A Concise Catalog of Contemporary Puzzles 37
is no substance in the body that is constant, though heart and brain
cells endure longer than most. And the substances that coexist at a
given time produce thousands of biochemical reactions in the body each
and every second.
The level of coherence exhibited by organisms suggests that quantum
type processes take place in them. For example, organisms respond to
extremely low frequency electromagnetic radiation, and to magnetic
fields so weak that only the most sophisticated instruments can register
them. But radiation below molecular dimensions could not affect
molecular assemblies unless a large number of molecules were super
coherently linked among themselves. Such linkages could come about
only if quantum processes complement the organism's biochemical
processes. The living organism, it appears, is in some respects a "macro
scopic quantum system."
Correlation within the organism embraces the set of the organism's
genes, the so-called genome. This is an anomaly for mainstream biol
ogy. According to classical Darwinism, the genome should be insulated
from the vicissitudes that befall the rest of the organism. There is to be
a full and complete separation of the germ line (the genetic information
handed down from parent to offspring) from the soma (the organism
that expresses the genetic information). Darwinists claim that in the
course of successive generations in the life of a species, the germ line
varies randomly, unaffected by influences acting on the soma. Evolution
proceeds by a selection from among the randomly created genetic vari
ants according to the "fit" of the soma (the resulting organism) to its
particular environment. Thus biological evolution is the product of a
twofold chance: the chance variation of the genome and the chance fit
of the resulting mutants to their environment. To cite the metaphor
made popular by the Oxford biologist Richard Dawkins, evolution
occurs through trial and error: the work of a blind watchmaker.
However, the classical Darwinian tenet regarding the isolation of
the genome is not correct. It has been proved false indirectly, through
statistical probability, and empirically, by way of laboratory experi
ments. Genome, organism, and environment form an integrated system



38 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
where functionally autonomous parts are so correlated that the organ
ism can survive, and can produce offspring that prove viable under con
ditions that would have been fatal to the parent.
The connection between genes and environments is demonstrated
in laboratory experiments. Gene-environment connection can be con
veyed even by mechanical means. The cell biologist A. Maniotis
described an experiment where a mechanical force impressed on an
external cellular membrane was transmitted to the cell nucleus. This
produced a mutation almost instantly. The experimentalist Michael
Lieber went further. His work demonstrated that mechanical force act
ing on the outer membrane of cells is but one variety of interaction that
results in a genetic rearrangement: any stress coming from the environ
ment, mechanical or not, triggers a global "hypermutation." The
genome is dynamic and highly adaptive. When challenged it creates a
complex and practically instant series of rearrangements, producing
even in-themselves-unnecessary steps if they facilitate the necessary
steps.
The recently discovered "adaptive response" of the genome is also
evident when electromagnetic or radioactive fields irradiate the organ
ism: this, too, has a direct effect on the structure of its genes. In many
cases the new arrangement shows up in the offspring. Experiments in
Japan and the United States show that rats develop diabetes when a
drug administered in the laboratory damages the insulin-producing cells
of their pancreas. These diabetic rats produce offspring in which dia
betes arises spontaneously! It appears that the alteration of the rats'
body cells produces a rearrangement of their genes.
Even more striking are experiments in which particular genes of a
strain of bacterium are rendered defective - for example, genes that
enable bacteria to metabolize lactose. When these bacteria are fed a
pure milk diet, some among them mutate back precisely those of their
genes that enable them to metabolize it again. Given the complexity of
the genome even of humble bacteria, this response is astronomically
unlikely to occur purely by chance.
Exposure to chemicals also produces adaptive mutation. When



A Concise Catalog of Contemporary Puzzles 39
plants and insects are subjected to toxic substances, they often mutate
their gene pool in precisely such a way that detoxifies the poisons and
creates resistance to them.
The German theoretician Marco Bischof summed up the key insight
currently emerging at the frontiers of the life sciences. "Quantum
mechanics has established the primacy of the inseparable whole. For
this reason," he said (and the emphasis is his), "the basis of the new
biophysics must be the insight into the fundamental interconnectedness
within the organism as well as between organisms, and that of the
organism with the environment."
Could a field, sometimes called "biofield," instantly and con
tinuously coordinate the myriad interactions of the organism's
myriad molecules, genes, and cells, and correlate entire organ
isms and species with their environment? Could it be that the
Akashic Field we have encountered in microphysics and in cos
mology is also active in the domains of life - that it intercon
nects organisms and ecologies, much as it interconnects quanta
at the ultrasmall scale of reality and the universe at the super
large scale?
4. THE PUZZLES OF CONSCIOUSNESS RESEARCH
Consciousness is the most intimately and immediately known fact of
our experience. It accompanies us from birth, presumably until death.
It is unique, and seems to belong uniquely to each of us. Yet "my" con
sciousness may not be solely and uniquely mine. The connections that
bind "my" consciousness to the consciousness of others, well known to
traditional - so-called primitive, but in fact in many respects highly
sophisticated - peoples, are rediscovered today in controlled experi
ments with thought and image transference, and the effect of the mind
of one individual on the body of another.



40 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
THE TRANSPERSONAL WORLD OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS
THE PRINCIPAL LANDMARK: THE CONNECTEDNESS OF THE HUMAN MIND
• Native tribes seem able to communicate beyond the range of
eye and ear. As shown by the customs, buildings, and arti
facts of diverse peoples who lived on different points of the
globe, and may have lived at different times, entire cultures
appear to have shared information among themselves, even
though they were not in any known form of contact with
each other.
• In the laboratory also, modern people display a capacity for
spontaneous transference of impressions and images, espe
cially when they are emotionally close to each other.
• Some images and ideas - universal symbols and archetypes
occur and recur in the culture of all civilizations, modern and
ancient, whether or not their people have known each other
or have even known of each other's existence.
• The mind of one person appears able to act on the brain and
body of another. This faculty, known to traditional peoples,
is verified today in controlled experiments and forms the
basis of a new branch of medicine known as telesomatic or
nonlocal medicine.
Current findings at the farther reaches of human consciousness
recall Einstein's pronouncement half a century ago. "A human being"
he said, "is part of the whole, called by us 'universe,' a part limited in
time and space. He experiences his thoughts and feelings as something
separate from the rest - a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.
This delusion is a sort of prison for us, restricting us to our personal



A Concise Catalog of Contemporary Puzzles 41
decisions and to affection for a few persons nearest us." While in the
conservative view human communication and interaction is limited to
our sensory channels (everything that is in the mind, it is said, must first
have been in the eye or ear), leading psychologists, psychiatrists, and
consciousness researchers are rediscovering what Einstein realized and
ancient cultures have always known: that we are linked by more subtle
and encompassing connections as well. In current scientific literature
these connections are called transpersonal.
Traditional cultures did not regard transpersonal connections with
distant peoples, tribes, or cultures as illusion, but modern societies do.
The modern mind is not ready to accept anything as real that is not
"manifest" - not literally "ready to hand" (manus being Latin for
"hand"). Consequently, transpersonal connections are viewed as para
normal and admitted only under exceptional conditions.
One of the exceptions is "twin pain" - when one of a pair of iden
tical twins senses the pain or trauma of the other. This phenomenon is
well documented. Guy Playfair, who wrote the book Twin Telepathy,
noted that about thirty percent of twins experience telepathic intercon
nection. He cites a 1997 television program where the production team
tested four pairs of identical twins. The brain waves, blood pressure,
and galvanic skin response of the four pairs of twins were rigorously
monitored. One of the unsuspecting twins in each pair was subjected to
a loud alarm fitted to the back of the chair in which he or she was sit
ting. In three of the four pairs, the other twin registered the resulting
shock, even through he or she was closeted some distance away in a
separate and soundproof room. The successful pairs were used for the
show that went live on the air, and they again showed the telepathic
information transmission, although the receiving twin could not give an
account of what it was that the other twin had experienced. The tech
nical supervisor of the show concluded that the twins "certainly picked
up something from somewhere."
Identical twins are only the top of the tree of bonded pairs. Some
form of telepathy has been observed among all people who share a deep
bond, such as mothers and children, lovers, long-term couples, even



42 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
close friends. In these cases all but the most conservative psychologists
are forced to recognize the existence of some transpersonal contact. But
only exceptionally broad-minded psychologists admit that transper
sonal contact includes the ability to transmit thoughts and images, and
that it is given to many and perhaps all people. Yet this is the finding of
recent experiments. The telepathic powers of people - their ability to
carry out various forms of thought and image transference - is not just
wishful thinking or a misreading of the results. A whole spectrum of
experimental protocols has been developed, ranging from the noise
reduction procedure known as the Ganzfeld technique to the rigorous
"distant mental influence on living systems" (DMILS) method.
Explanations in terms of hidden sensory cues, machine bias, cheating
by subjects, and experimenter incompetence or error have all been con
sidered, but were found unable to account for a number of statistically
significant results. It appears that almost all people possess "paranor
mal" abilities.
Not only can people communicate with the minds of other people,
but they can also interact with other people's bodies. Reliable evidence
is becoming available that the conscious mind of one person can pro
duce repeatable and measurable effects on the body of another. These
effects, in turn, are known as telesomatic.
Telesomatic effects were known to so-called primitive peoples:
anthropologists call them "sympathetic magic." Shamans, witch doc
tors, and those who practice such magic (voodoo, for example) do not
act on the person they target, but rather on an effigy of that person,
such as a doll. This practice is widespread among traditional peoples.
In his famous study The Golden Bough, Sir James Frazer noted that
Native American shamans would draw the figure of a person in sand,
ashes, or clay and then prick it with a sharp stick or do it some other
injury. The corresponding injury was said to be inflicted on the person
the figure represented. Observers found that the targeted person often
fell ill, became lethargic, and sometimes even died.
There are positive variants of sympathetic magic today that are
increasingly widely known and practiced. One variant is the kind of



A Concise Catalog of Contemporary Puzzles 43
alternative medicine known as spiritual healing. The healer acts on the
organism of his or her patient by "spiritual" means - that is, by send
ing a healing force or healing information. Healer and patient can be
directly face to face, or miles apart; distance does not seem to affect the
outcome. The effectiveness of this kind of healing may be surprising,
but it is well documented. Renowned physician Larry Dossey calls the
corresponding medical practice "Era III nonlocal medicine," suggesting
that it is the successor to Era I biochemical medicine, and Era II psy
chosomatic medicine.
Another form of positively oriented sympathetic magic is healing by
intercessory prayer. The effectiveness of prayer has been known to reli
gious people and communities for hundreds and indeed thousands of
years. But the credit for documenting it in a controlled experiment is
due to the heart specialist Randolph Byrd. He undertook a ten-month
computer-assisted study of the medical histories of patients at the coro
nary care unit at San Francisco General Hospital. As reported in the
Southern Medical Journal in 1988, Byrd formed a group of experi
menters made up of ordinary people whose only common characteris
tic was a habit of regular prayer in Catholic or Protestant congregations
around the country. The selected people were asked to pray for the
recovery of a group of 192 patients; another set of 210 patients, for
whom nobody prayed, made up the control group. Neither the patients,
nor the nurses and doctors knew which patients belonged to which
group. The people who were to pray were given the names of the
patients and some information about their heart condition. As each per
son could pray for several patients, all patients had between five and
seven people praying for them. The results were significant. The
prayed-for group was five times less likely than the control group to
require antibiotics (three compared to sixteen patients); it was three
times less likely to develop pulmonary edema (six versus eighteen
patients); none in the prayed-for group required endotracheal incuba
tion (while twelve patients in the control group did); and fewer patients
died in the former than in the latter group (though this particular result
was statistically not significant). It did not matter how close or far the



44 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
patients were to those who prayed for them, nor did the manner of praying make any difference. Only the fact of concentrated and repeated prayer was a factor, without regard to whom the prayer was addressed and where the prayers took place.
Intercessory prayer and spiritual healing, together with other mindand intention-based experiments and practices, yield impressive evidence regarding the effectiveness of telepathic and telesomatic informationand energy-transmission. The pertinent practices produce real and measurable effects on people, and they are more and more widespread. But mainstream science has no explanation for them.
Could it be that our consciousness is linked with other consciousnesses through an interconnecting Akashic Field, much as galaxies are linked in the cosmos, quanta in the microworld, and organisms in the world of the living? And could this be the same field we have encountered before, manifesting itself in the realm of mind, in addition to the realms of nature?

Searching for the Memory
of the Universe
Our review of the puzzles encountered in contemporary science has set the stage for the quest to which this book is dedicated: to achieve a scientifically founded integral theory of everything. We have gained an important insight. We have found that in order to account for a growing number of things and processes that are undoubtedly real and are likely to be fundamental, we must recognize that there is more to the world than the current paradigm of science allows for. Let us look again at the principal findings:
• The universe as a whole manifests fine-tuned correlations that
defy commonsense explanation.
• Astonishingly close correlations exist on the level of the quantum: every particle that has ever occupied the same quantum state as another particle remains correlated with it in a mysterious, nonenergetic way.
• Post-Darwinian evolutionary theory and quantum biology discover similarly puzzling correlations within the organism and between the organism and its milieu.
• The correlations that come to light in the farther reaches of consciousness research are just as strange: they are in the form of "transpersonal connections" between the consciousness of one person and the mind and body of another.
45



46 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
When we review these puzzles of connection and correlation, we
come to a remarkable conclusion. The networks of connection that
make for a coherently evolving cosmos, for the entanglement of quanta,
for the instant connection between organisms and environments and
between the consciousnesses of different and even far removed human
beings, have one and the same explanation. There is not only matter and
energy in the universe, but also a more subtle yet real element: informa
tion in the form of active and effective "in-formation." In-formation of
this kind connects all things in space and time - indeed it connects all
things through space and time. As a number of cutting-edge scientists,
among them Nikola Tesla, then David Bohm, and more recently Harold
Puthoff, surmised, interactions in the domains of nature as well as of
mind are mediated by a fundamental information field at the heart of
the universe.
ON THE TRACK OF NATURE'S INFORMATION FIELD
In the beginning of the twentieth century, the much neglected - but now
more and more rediscovered - genius Nikola Tesla, the father of modern
communication technologies, spoke of an "original medium" that fills
space and compared it to Akasha, the light-carrying ether. In his unpub
lished 1907 paper "Man's greatest achievement," he wrote that this orig
inal medium, a kind of force field, becomes matter when prana, cosmic
energy, acts on it, and when the action ceases, matter vanishes and
returns to Akasha. Since this medium fills all of space, everything that
takes place in space can be referred to it. The curvature of space, said
Tesla, which was put forward at the time by Einstein, is not the answer.
However, by the end of the first decade of the twentieth century,
physicists adopted Einstein's mathematically elaborated four-dimensional
curved space-time and, with the exception of a few maverick theo
reticians, refused to consider any concept of a space-filling ether,
medium, or force field. Tesla's insight fell into disrepute, and then into
oblivion. Today it is revived. Bohm, Puthoff, and a small but growing
group of scientists are rediscovering the role of information in nature,



Searching for the Memory of the Universe 47
and locating nature's information field in the quantum vacuum, the
much discussed if as yet imperfectly understood energy sea that fills
cosmic space.
BACKGROUND BRIEF
THE QUANTUM VACUUM
The concept of space-time as an energy-filled substratum of the
universe emerged in the course of the twentieth century. At the
beginning of that century, space was already believed to be filled
with an invisible energy field - the luminiferous ether - that pro
duces friction when bodies move through it and thus slows their
motion. But when such friction failed to materialize in the
famous Michelson-Morley experiments, the ether was removed
from the physicists' world picture. The absolute vacuum - space
that is truly empty when not occupied by matter - took its place.
However, the cosmic vacuum turned out to be far from empty
space. In the "grand unified theories" (GUTs) developed in the
second half of the twentieth century, the concept of the vacuum
transformed from empty space into the medium that carries the
zero-point field, or ZPF. (The name derives from the fact that in
this field energies prove to be present even when all classical
forms of energy vanish: at the absolute zero of temperature.) In
subsequent unified theories, the roots of all of nature's fields and
forces were ascribed to the mysterious energy sea known as the
"unified vacuum."
More and more interactions have come to light between this
fundamental field and the observed things and processes of the
physical world. In the 1960s Paul Dirac showed that fluctuations
in fermion fields (fields of matter particles) produce a polariza
tion of the ZPF of the vacuum, whereby the vacuum in turn
affects the particles' mass, charge, spin, or angular momentum.



48 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
At around the same time, Andrei Sakharov proposed that rela
tivistic phenomena (the slowing down of clocks and the shrink
ing of yardsticks near the speed of light) are the result of effects
induced in the vacuum due to the shielding of the zero-point
field by charged particles. This is a revolutionary idea, since in
this concept the vacuum is more than relativity theory's four
dimensional continuum: it is not just the geometry of space
time, but a real physical field producing real physical effects.
The physical interpretation of the vacuum in terms of the
zero-point field was reinforced in the 1970s, when Paul Davis
and William Unruh put forward a hypothesis that differentiates
between uniform and accelerated motion in the zero-point field.
Uniform motion would not disturb the ZPF, leaving it isotropic
(the same in all directions), whereas accelerated motion would
produce a thermal radiation that breaks open the field's all
directional symmetry. During the 1990s, numerous explorations
were undertaken on this premise, going well beyond the already
"classical" Casimir force and Lamb shift.
The Casimir force is well known. Between two closely placed
metal plates, some wavelengths of the vacuum's energies are
excluded, and this reduces the vacuum's energy density with
respect to the vacuum energies on the outer side of the plates.
The disequilibrium creates a pressure - this is the "Casimir
force" - that pushes the plates inward and together. The Lamb
shift, another thoroughly investigated vacuum effect, consists of
the frequency shift exhibited by the photons that are emitted
when electrons around the nucleus of an atom leap from one
energy state to another. The shift is due to the photon exchang
ing energy with the ZPF.
Further effects have been found. Harold Puthoff, Bernhard
Haisch, and collaborators produced a sophisticated theory
according to which the inertial force, the gravitational force,
and even mass are consequences of the interaction of charged



Searching for the Memory of the Universe 49
particles with the ZPF. Puthoff also noted that electrons orbit
ing atomic nuclei constantly radiate energy, so that they would
move progressively closer to the given nucleus were it not that
the quantum of energy they absorb from the vacuum offsets the
energy lost due to their orbital motion.
Even the stability of our planet in its orbit around the Sun
derives from vacuum-energy inputs. As Earth pursues its orbital
path, it loses momentum; given a constant loss of momentum,
the gravitational field of the Sun - in the absence of an influx of
energy from the ZPF - would overcome the centrifugal force
that pushes Earth around its orbit and Earth would spiral into
the Sun. This means that in addition to inertia, gravity, and
mass, the very stability of both atoms and solar systems is due
to interaction with the zero-point field of the vacuum.
Although much remains to be discovered about the quantum
vacuum, it is already clear that it is a superdense cosmic
medium. It carries light, and all the universal forces of nature.
Pressure waves may propagate through it, traversing the uni
verse from one end to the other. This is the finding of the
German mathematical physicist Hartmut Mueller, who claims
that the observed dimension of all entities, from atoms to galax
ies, is determined by interaction with density-pressure waves
propagating in the vacuum. According to his "global scaling
theory," the universe is dimensionally limited: on the lower end
of the dimensional horizons, matter density is the greatest, and
on the upper end it is the least. This is due to vacuum-based
pressure waves. Because the universe is finite, at the critical
dimension points the waves superpose and create enduring
standing waves. These waves determine physical interactions by
setting the value of the gravitational, the electromagnetic, and
the strong and weak nuclear forces. By means of resonance they
amplify some vibrations and repress others; they are thus respon
sible for the distribution of matter throughout the cosmos. All



50 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
processes have an inner rhythm according to their resonance
with the vacuum's standing waves. Mueller concludes that the
vacuum is a cosmic ultraweak background that acts as a mor
phogenetic field.
Recent findings confirm the presence of pressure waves in the
vacuum. Astronomers in NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory
found a wave generated by the supermassive black hole in the
Perseus cluster of galaxies, some 250 million light-years from
Earth. This vacuum-pressure wave translates into the musical
note B flat. This is a real note that has been traveling through
the vacuum for the past 2.5 billion years. Our ears cannot per
ceive it: its frequency is fifty-seven octaves below middle C
more than a million billion times deeper than the limits of
human hearing.
A field that transports light (that is, waves of photons) and
density-pressure waves, and replenishes the energy lost by atoms
and solar systems, is not an abstract theoretical entity. No won
der that more and more physicists speak of the quantum vac
uum as a physically real cosmic plenum.
The quantum vacuum, it appears, transports light, energy, pressure,
and sound. Could it have a further property by means of which it cor
relates separate and possibly distant events? Could it create the corre
lations that make for the amazing coherence of the quantum, of the
organism, of consciousness - and of the whole universe? The vacuum
could indeed have such a property. It could be not just a superdense sea
of energy, but also a sea of information.
The possibility that the quantum vacuum could convey information
has been raised by a number of avant-garde investigators. For example,
Harold Puthoff remarked, " . . . on the cosmological scale a grand hand
in-glove equilibrium exists between the ever-agitated motion of matter



Searching for the Memory of the Universe 51
on the quantum level and the surrounding zero-point energy field. One
consequence of this is that we are literally, physically, 'in touch' with the
rest of the cosmos as we share with remote parts of the universe fluc
tuating zero-point fields of even cosmological dimensions." And,
Puthoff added, "[w]ho is to say whether, for example, modulation of
such fields might not carry meaningful information as in the popular
concept of 'the Force'?" The experiences of the Apollo astronaut Edgar
Mitchell while in space led him to the same conclusion. According to
Mitchell, information is part of the very substance of the universe. It is
one part of a "dyad" of which the other part is energy. Information is
present everywhere, and has been present since the birth of the universe.
The quantum vacuum, Mitchell said, is the holographic information
mechanism that records the historical experience of matter.
HOW THE QUANTUM VACUUM GENERATES, CONSERVES, AND CONVEYS INFORMATION
How could the quantum vacuum convey the "historical experience of
matter"? This is a fundamental question for contemporary physics and
possibly the key to the emerging paradigm of all sciences. There are
innovative theories that promise an exciting and scientifically valid
answer.
A particularly promising theory is the work of the Russian physi
cists G. I. Shipov, A. E. Akimov, and coworkers, further elaborated by
scientists in America as well as Europe. Their "torsion-wave" theory
shows how the vacuum can link physical events throughout space-time.
According to the Russian physicists, torsion waves link the universe at
a group speed of the order of 109 c - one billion times the speed of light!
Torsion-wave linking may involve more than the known forms of
energy: it may also involve information. It is standard knowledge that
particles that have a quantum property known as "spin" also have a
magnetic effect: they possess a specific magnetic momentum. The mag
netic impulse is registered in the vacuum in the form of minute vortices.
Like vortices in water, vacuum-based vortices have a nucleus around



52 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
which circle other elements - H20 molecules in the case of water, virtual
bosons (vacuum-based force particles) in the case of the zero-point
field. As the Hungarian theoretician Laszlo Gazdag has argued, these
tiny vortices carry information, much as magnetic impulses do on a
computer disk. The information carried by a given vortex corresponds
to the magnetic momentum of the particle that created it: it is informa
tion on the state of that particle. These minute spinning structures
travel through the vacuum, and they interact with each other. When
two or more of these torsion waves meet, they form an interference pat
tern that integrates the strands of information on the particles that cre
ated them. This interference pattern carries information on the entire
ensemble of the particles.
In a simplified but meaningful way we can say that vacuum vortices
record information on the state of the particles that created them - and
their interference pattern records information on the ensemble of the
particles of which the vortices have interfered. In this way the vacuum
records and carries information on atoms, molecules, macromolecules,
cells, even organisms and populations and ecologies of organisms.
There is no evident limit to the information that interfering vacuum tor
sion waves can conserve and convey. In the final count, they can carry
information on the state of the whole universe. Throughout the uni
verse, particles are linked by the vacuum in much the same way as
objects are linked in the sea: by making and receiving waves.
Consider the interconnections created by the sea. A moment's
reflection will tell you that the waves that propagate in the sea produce
a real even if temporary connection among the vessels, fish, and other
objects that generated them. When a ship travels on the sea's surface,
waves spread in its wake. These waves affect the motion of other
ships - something that has been dramatically brought home to anyone
who has ever sailed a small craft next to an ocean liner. Vessels that are
entirely immersed in the sea affect things not only on the surface, but
also above and below. A submarine, for example, creates subsurface
waves that propagate in every direction. Another submarine - and
every fish, whale, or object in the sea - is exposed to these waves and is



Searching for the Memory of the Universe 53
in a sense shaped, "in-formed," by them. A second submarine likewise
"makes waves," and this affects - in-forms - the first, as well as all
other things in that part of the sea.
When many things move simultaneously in a waving medium, be
it the ordinary sea or the extraordinary vacuum, that medium
becomes modulated: full of waves that intersect and interfere. This is
what happens when several ships ply the sea's surface. If we view the
sea from a height - a coastal hill or an airplane - on a calm day, we
can see the traces of ships that passed hours before on that stretch of
water. We can also see how the traces intersect and create complex
patterns. The modulation of the sea's surface by the ships that disturb
it carries information on the ships that created the disturbance. This
has practical applications: one can deduce the location, speed, and even
the tonnage of the vessels by analyzing the resulting wave-interference
patterns.
As fresh waves superimpose on those already present, the sea
becomes more and more modulated - it carries more and more infor
mation. On calm days its surface remains modulated for hours, and
sometimes for days. The wave patterns that persist are the memory of
the ships that moved about on that stretch of water. If wind, gravity,
and shorelines did not cancel these patterns, this memory would persist
indefinitely. But wind, gravity, and shorelines do come into play, and
sooner or later the sea's memory dissipates. (This, we should note, does
not mean that the memory of the water disappears. Water has a
remarkable capacity to register and conserve information, as indicated
by, among other things, homeopathic remedies that remain effective
even when not a single molecule of the original substance remains in a
dilution.) In the vacuum, however, there are no forces or things that
could cancel or even attenuate waves: the vacuum is considered to be a
frictionless medium. In a frictionless medium waves and objects move
without resistance and - in the absence of contrary forces - could move
forever. Thus, if the vacuum is a truly frictionless medium, the wave
memory of the universe may be eternal.
But could any medium be truly frictionless? The answer is yes:



54 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
supercooled helium is entirely frictionless, as the Dutch physicist
Kammerlingh Onnes discovered in 1911. He took helium - normally a
gas - and cooled it degree by degree until it approached the absolute
zero of temperature signified by zero on the Kelvin scale. When the tem
perature of the helium reached 4.2 Kelvin, a dramatic change occurred.
Helium lost its gaseous properties: it became liquid. At the same time,
under equal pressure, it became 800 times denser! When Onnes cooled
this superdense liquid helium still further, at 2.17 Kelvin another major
change occurred: the liquid helium became superfluid. Supercooled
helium, though it is superdense, does not resist objects passing through
it. It flows frictionless through cracks and apertures so tiny that noth
ing else, not even a much thinner gas, can penetrate them - at least, not
without notable friction.
Superfluid helium is a good analogy for the superdense and at the
same time frictionless cosmic vacuum. According to John Wheeler's
calculations, the energy density of the vacuum is 1094 erg per cubic
centimeter - a stupendous amount that is far greater than the energy
associated with all the matter particles throughout the universe.
(Matter particles are particles that have mass and, as Einstein's famous
equation tells us, mass accelerated to the square of the velocity of light
is equivalent to energy.) The fact is that the vacuum is both superfluid
and superdense - much like helium near the absolute zero of tempera
ture. This is a mind-boggling combination, for how can something be
denser than anything else and at the same time more fluid than any
thing else? The vacuum, just like supercooled helium, may be a mind
boggling medium, but it is not a supernatural one.
All things in the universe are immersed in the superdense yet super
fluid cosmic vacuum, and all things produce waves that move the vac
uum out of its "ground state" (i.e., create vortices that "excite" the
vacuum). These torsion waves propagate in the vacuum and they inter
fere. The interference patterns they create integrate the information car
ried by the individual vortices. As the vortices of individual things
merge, the information they carry is not overwritten, for the waves
superpose one on the other. And the superposed waves are in a sense



Searching for the Memory of the Universe 55
everywhere throughout the vacuum. This, too, is a natural phenome
non: it is familiar in the form of holograms.
In a holographic recording - created by the interference pattern of
two light beams - there is no one-to-one correspondence between
points on the surface of the object that is recorded and points in the
recording itself. Holograms carry information in a distributed form, so
all the information that makes up a hologram is present in every part
of it. The points that make up the recording of the object's surface are
present throughout the interference patterns recorded on the photo
graphic plate: in a way, the image of the object is enfolded throughout
the plate. As a result, when any small piece of the plate is illuminated,
the full image of the object appears, though it may be fuzzier than the
image resulting from illuminating the entire plate.
Superposed vacuum-interference patterns are nature's "holo
grams"; they carry distributed information on all the particles, and on
all the ensembles of particles, throughout the reaches of space and time.
The hypothesis we can now advance may be daring, but it is logical.
The quantum vacuum generates the holographic field that is the mem
ory of the universe.



FIVE
Enter the Akashic Field
All along our review of the puzzles of the mainstream sciences, we have
been suspecting that the mysterious field implied by time- and space
transcending correlations in cosmos and consciousness may be an infor
mation field at the very heart of the cosmos. This suspicion has been
borne out: the zero-point field of the quantum vacuum is not only a
superdense energy field; it is also a super-rich information field - the
holographic memory of the universe. This finding recalls Indian philos
ophy's concept of the Akashic Chronicle, the record of everything that
happens in the world traced in the Akashic Field. It makes sense to
name the newly (re)discovered information field of the universe the "A
field," after ancient tradition's Akashic Field. The A-field takes its place
among the fundamental fields of the universe, joining science's G-field
(the gravitational field), EM-field (the electromagnetic field), and the
various nuclear and quantum fields.
The Akashic Field may be an age-old intuition shared by countless
generations, but the field named after it is a radical innovation in con
temporary science. We should examine the grounds for this innovation,
to make sure that it is not just a chimera of the imagination.
WHY THE A-FIELD - REVIEWING THE EVIDENCE*
The evidence for a cosmic information field - like the evidence for all
fundamental laws and processes in nature - is not direct; it must be

reconstructed by reasoning. Like the G-field and the EM-field, the
A-field cannot be seen heard, touched, tasted, or smelled. It is indicated,
however, by many things that we can and do perceive. These things are
not accounted for in the mainstream theories; to the conservative core
of the science establishment, they are puzzling and mysterious. Yet the
puzzles and mysteries have a common thrust. We can see what this
thrust is when we review the bold yet rigorously argued hypotheses
the "scientific fables" - advanced today by cutting-edge investigators in
fields as diverse as cosmology, quantum physics, biology, and con
sciousness research.
Let us revisit, then, the puzzles we encountered in chapter 3 and
bring them together with the fables that attempt to throw light on them.
We begin with the puzzles of the universe - the "cosmic puzzles"
and the fables of the Metaverse. We then move to the puzzles at the
roots of physical reality - the "quantum puzzles" - and the fables of
entanglement and nonlocality that address them. We go next to the puz
zles of the living organism and fables about the interconnected web of
life. We conclude our review with the puzzles and fables that come to
light in the most intimately known domain of our experience: the
domain of consciousness.
1. COSMOLOGY
Cosmic Puzzles: Footprints of the A-Field in the
Physical Universe
As noted in chapter 3, the standard model of the universe is not as
established today as it was even a few years ago. A number of anom
alies have come to light, cosmic puzzles that the Big Bang theory can
not explain.
The flat universe. Until the results of observations made with a
balloon-based telescope lofted over Antarctica in 1998 became avail
able, cosmologists could not answer the question of whether the uni
verse is flat (with a space-time structure that is essentially
"Euclidean" - that is, where light, except near massive bodies, travels



58 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
in a straight line), or open (with an infinitely expanding negatively
curved space-time), or closed (expanding to a limit and then contract
ing with a positively curved space-time). The correct answer depends on
the amount of matter in the universe. If there is more matter in the uni
verse than the "critical density" (estimated at 5 x 10 - 26 g/cm3), the grav
itational pull associated with matter particles will ultimately exceed the
inertial force generated by the Big Bang. Then the expansion of the uni
verse will reverse and we will find ourselves in a closed universe that
collapses back on itself. If, however, matter density is below the critical
quantity, its gravitational pull is more modest, and the force of expan
sion will continue to dominate it; we then live in an open universe, one
that expands forever. If matter density is precisely at the critical value,
the forces of expansion and contraction balance each other, making our
universe flat: forever balanced at the razor's edge between the opposing
forces of expansion and contraction.
Whether the universe is open, closed, or flat seems to have been sat
isfactorily answered by a number of increasingly sophisticated cosmic
probes. First came the Boomerang project's observations of the cosmic
microwave background in 1998 ("Boomerang" stands for Balloon
Observations of Millimetric Extragalactic Radiation and Geophysics),
then the observations of MAXIMA (Millimeter Anisotropy Experiment
Imagining Array) and of DASI (Degree Angular Scale Interferometer,
based on a microwave telescope at the South Pole). In February of 2003,
the findings of the WMAP were released. (The acronym stands for
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, which is a satellite launched in
Earth orbit in June 30, 2001, recording cosmic radiation from a point
on the far side of the moon.) They held no surprises, but refined the pre
vious estimates and provided greater certainty of their validity.
It is now beyond all reasonable doubt that we live in a flat universe.
This confirms predictions flowing out of the Big Bang theory, but it is
astounding just the same. Because if the universe is flat today, the Big
Bang that produced all matter in it must have been fine-tuned to the
staggering order of 1 part in 1050. A deviation even of that minute
order would have produced an infinitely expanding ("open") or a finite



Enter the Akasbic Field 59
recollapsing ("closed") universe. How this level of precision could have come about has no explanation in the Big Bang theory. That it occurred purely by chance is plausible only if there are a very large number of universes in the cosmos, because then even an improbably well-tuned universe such as ours has some probability of coming about, just as in a very large number of throws of a die even a run of sixes has some likelihood of turning up.
The missing mass. A still more vexing puzzle is why observations through optical telescopes fail to locate the amount of matter we should find in cosmic space. According to current observations, the matter density of the universe is less than 10- 30 g/cm3 - a density that is not sufficient to counteract the force of expansion and create a flat universe. Astrophysicists theorize, however, that a great deal of the matter in the universe is optically invisible. (Visible matter is composed mainly of protons and neutrons, so-called baryons.) Only four percent of the material substance of the universe is made up of objects of visible matter, such as galaxies, stars, planets, interstellar dust, and other astronomical bodies disclosed by optical telescopes. A further twenty-three percent seems to consist of baryonic dark matter (protons and neutrons in structures that are too dim to be visible), as well as of nonbaryonic dark matter (exotic particles such as axions, neutrinos with mass, and WIMPs - weakly interacting massive particles). Yet even the sum total of visible and invisible matter leaves some seventy-three percent of the substance of the universe unaccounted for. This enormous quantity appears to be not matter at all, but "dark energy" - a property of space itself, very likely due to the fluctuation of virtual particles in the quantum vacuum.
Accelerating expansion. In a flat universe - possessing the critical matter density where the inertial force of expansion is precisely balanced by the force of gravitation - the galaxies should be expanding in a gradually slowing fashion, with the momentum of the explosion that drove them apart being progressively slowed by gravitational attraction pulling them toward each other. But this is not the case: the expansion of the galaxies is actually speeding up!



60 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
Observations of sufficient precision to determine the expansion of
distant galaxies became available only recently. Previously, Edwin
Hubble and other astronomers estimated distances to the observed
galaxies by assuming that all galaxies have uniform brightness. If so,
those that appear brighter would be closer than those that are dim
mer. This, however, fails to take into account that there are galaxies
with stars of different intrinsic luminosity. It also fails to account for
galaxies so far away that the light that reaches us now was emitted in
an early phase of their evolution, at which time their intrinsic bright
ness was considerably different from their brightness as mature galax
ies. What astronomers need are galaxies of well-determined
brightness, so-called standard candles. By the 1990s, some candles of
this kind became known. They are one variety of supernova (the
explosion that marks the end of the life cycle of certain stars), known
as type la.
When a star has reached the stage when it has converted most of
the hydrogen in its mass to helium, carbon, oxygen, neon, and some
other heavy elements, its outer layers are compressed by gravity to a
size roughly the size of Earth but a million times more dense than ordi
nary matter. Most of these "white dwarfs" cool and fade without dra
matic changes, but if one of these superdense objects orbits near an
active star, its intense gravity siphons off matter from that star. This
increases the white dwarf's density until a thermonuclear chain reaction
gets under way. We then have a supernova: the white dwarf explodes,
spewing forth its atomic matter at the speed of 10,000 kilometers per
second. Since the duration of the supernova depends on its brilliance,
astronomers following its evolution can determine its inherent bright
ness to a high degree of precision.
Dozens of these standard candles have now been studied at dis
tances between four and seven billion light-years away. Their intrinsic
brightness can be calculated on the basis of their distance. But these
candles are dimmer than their distance would warrant - the observed
values do not match the predicted values. This means that they are
more distant than the standard model predicts. The cosmos must be



Enter the Akashic Field 61
expanding faster than cosmologists have thought. Something - some
force or energy - must be pushing the galaxies apart.
The current finding brings back the notion of a cosmological con
stant, first postulated but then discarded by Einstein. In Einstein's
"steady state" universe, matter is not created in the womb of a Big Bang
but instead is spread homogeneously in space. That it stays so - rather
than clumping together under gravitational attraction - is ensured by
his cosmological constant, which stands for a force of repulsion that
precisely balances the attractive force of gravitation. Consequently, the
universe neither expands nor contracts: it remains in a steady state.
Within five years of putting forward the hypothesis of the cosmo
logical constant, Einstein abandoned it, calling it his biggest blunder.
Evidence came to light that the universe is unstable, and in a 1923 let
ter to the mathematician Hermann Weyl, Einstein admitted that if there
is no quasi-static world, then one must do away with the cosmological
term.
This conclusion was premature. Current measurements of the cos
mic background indicate that even if all matter in the universe origi
nated in a Big Bang, space-time is nevertheless flat: the universe should
be precisely balanced between expansion and contraction. Yet the
galaxies are expanding! Perhaps there is a cosmological constant after
all, one that pushes apart the cosmos, rather than just keeping it in a
steady state.
Cosmologists suspect that the quantum vacuum is the source of the
strange energies represented by this constant. Space is filled with virtual
particles, in constant fluctuation. The energy of the particles matches
the effects attributed to them, even if they themselves exist too briefly
to be measured. This energy - the positive cosmological constant - is
believed to be responsible for the accelerating expansion of the galax
ies. The assumption is not new: already in the 1960s, the physicist
Yakov Zeldovich showed that vacuum energies act in precisely the way
presupposed in Einstein's estimate of the cosmological constant.
But this assumption is not perfect: the sum total of the energy con
tent of the quantum vacuum is far greater than the value required for



62 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
the additional force of expansion. As John Wheeler's calculations show,
the magnitude of vacuum energy is mind-boggling - even when correc
tions due to quantum effects are taken into account, it still exceeds by
some 120 orders of magnitude the energy contained in all matter
throughout the universe! (The vacuum energy that sets the cosmologi
cal constant should be less than 108 joules per cubic meter, but the most
reasonable calculation of vacuum energy yields a value of 10112 joules
per cubic meter - which is 10120 times too much.) Because gravitation is
associated with energy (as defined in Einstein's formula E = mc2), this
excess energy would inject so much gravitation into the universe that
particles would accelerate even in the absence of other objects, and all
things made of particles (planets, stars, galaxies) would fly apart. The
universe would expand like a rapidly inflating balloon. In every region
of space, the cosmological constant would dramatically thin the matter
content of the cosmos. In our vicinity, space would be nearly empty.
Looking up at the night sky, we would not see anything other than the
moon and the planets of our solar system. Indeed, we would not see
even those: assuming that general relativity theory holds true, space
time would be so highly curved that visibility would be limited to a sin
gle kilometer. In the daytime we would not see the Sun, not even planes
flying higher than a thousand meters. Yet we see the Sun and high
flying planes in the daytime, and billions of stars billions of light-years
away at night.
Obviously there is something in the universe, some factor or com
bination of factors, that keeps the cosmological constant, if not at zero,
at the small but precise positive excess value that makes for the
observed expansion of the galaxies without blowing the universe apart.
Coherence of cosmic ratios. There are a number of strange coinci
dences regarding the observed parameters of the universe. Already in
the 1930s, Sir Arthur Eddington and Paul Dirac noted some remarkable
facts about the "dimensionless ratios" that relate the universe's basic
parameters to each other. For example, the ratio of the electric force to
the gravitational force is approximately 1040, and the ratio of the
observable size of the universe to the size of elementary particles is



Enter the Akasbic Field 63
likewise around 1040. This is all the more strange as the former ratio
should be unchanging (the two forces are assumed to be constant),
whereas the latter is changing (since the universe is expanding). In his
"large number hypothesis," Dirac speculated that the agreement of
these ratios, the one variable, the other not, is not merely a temporary
coincidence. But if the coincidence is more than temporary, either the
universe is not expanding or the force of gravitation varies in accor
dance with its expansion!
Additional coincidences involve the ratio of elementary particles to
the Planck-length (this ratio is 1020) and the number of nucleons in the
universe ("Eddington's number," which is approximately 2 x 1079).
These are very large numbers, yet "harmonic" numbers can be con
structed from them. For example, Eddington's number is roughly equal
to the square of 1040.
Recently the astrophysicist Menas Kafatos together with Robert
Nadeau and Roy Amoroso showed that many of these coincidences can
be interpreted in terms of the relationship on the one hand between the
masses of elementary particles and the total number of nucleons in the
universe, and on the other between the gravitational constant, the
charge of the electron, Planck's constant, and the speed of light. Scale
invariant relationships appear - the physical parameters of the universe
turn out to be proportional to its overall scale.
The "horizon problem." The coherence indicated by numerical
relationships is reinforced by observational evidence. The latter gives
rise to the so-called horizon problem: the problem of the large-scale
uniformity of the cosmos at all points of the horizon as seen from
Earth. This comes to the fore both in regard to the universe's back
ground radiation and in relation to the evolution of its galaxies.
The universe's microwave background radiation proves to be
isotropic (the same in all directions). This radiation is believed to be
the remnant of the Big Bang; according to BB theory, it was emitted
when the universe was about 400,000 years old. The problem is that
at that point in time the opposite sides of the expanding universe were
already ten million light-years apart. By that time, light could have



64 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
traveled only 400,000 light-years, so no physical force or signal could
have connected the expanding regions. Yet the cosmic background radi
ation is uniform for billions of light-years wherever we look in space.
This is true not only of the background radiation; galaxies and
multi-galactic structures in the cosmic "foreground" also evolve in a
uniform manner in all directions from Earth. This is the case even in
regard to galaxies that have not been in physical contact with each
other since the birth of the universe. If a galaxy ten billion light-years
from Earth in one direction exhibits structures analogous to a galaxy
the same distance away in the opposite direction, then structures that
are twenty billion light-years from each other are uniform. This unifor
mity cannot be the consequence of physical linkages, since the highest
rate at which physical forces can propagate in space-time is the speed
of light. Although by now light reached across the ten-billion-light-year
distance to Earth from each of the galaxies (which is why we can see
them), in a universe less than twenty billion years old it could not have
reached from one of these galaxies to the other. Nonetheless, even over
distances not connected by light, our 13.7-billion-year-old universe
evolves as a coherent whole.
The tuning of the constants. Perhaps the most mysterious of all the
cosmic puzzles is the observed "fine-tuning" of the physical constants
of the universe. The basic parameters of the cosmos have precisely the
value that allows complex structures to arise. From our perspective this
is fortunate, for the existence of these structures is a precondition of life
on this planet - if the universe were any less finely tuned, we would not
be here to speculate on the reasons for this precision. But is this mere
serendipity?
The fine-tuning in question involves upward of thirty factors and
considerable accuracy. For example, if the expansion rate of the early
universe had been one-billionth less than it was, the universe would
have re-collapsed almost immediately; and if it had been one-billionth
more, it would have flown apart so fast that it could produce only
dilute, cold gases. A similarly small difference in the strength of the elec
tromagnetic field relative to the gravitational field would have



Enter the Akashic Field 65
prevented the existence of hot and stable stars like the Sun, and hence
the evolution of life on planets associated with these stars. Moreover, if
the difference between the mass of the neutron and the proton were not
precisely twice the mass of the electron, no substantial chemical reac
tions could take place, and if the electric charge of electrons and pro
tons did not balance precisely, all configurations of matter would be
unstable and the universe would consist of nothing more than radiation
and a relatively uniform mixture of gases.
But even the astonishingly precisely adjusted laws and constants do
not fully explain how the universe would have evolved out of the pri
mordial radiation field. Galaxies had formed out of this radiation field
when the expanding universe's temperature dropped to 3,000 degrees
on the Kelvin scale. At that point the existing protons and electrons
formed atoms of hydrogen, and these atoms condensed under gravita
tional pull, producing stellar structures and the giant swirls that make
for the birth of galaxies. Calculations indicate that a very large number
of atoms would have had to come together to start the formation of
galaxies, perhaps of the order of 1016 suns. It is by no means clear how
this enormous quantity of atoms - equivalent to the mass of 100,000
galaxies - would have come together. Random fluctuations among indi
vidual atoms do not furnish a plausible explanation.
Cosmic Fables: The Universe of Universes
The rapidly growing field of physical cosmology is full of puzzles
anomalies that the established theories cannot explain. But cosmologists
are not stumped. In recent years a number of "cosmic fables" have seen
the light of day, including those that argue that our universe is not all
there is in the world. The larger reality, these new "cosmological sce
narios" tell us, is the Metaverse, the mother of our universe and perhaps
of a vast number of other universes. Metaverse scenarios, as we have
noted in chapter 3, deserve serious attention: they offer a particularly
promising approach to the puzzles that beset contemporary cosmology.



66 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
SOME CURRENT METAVERSE SCENARIOS
A widely discussed scenario advanced by the Princeton physicist
John Wheeler claims that the expansion of the universe will
come to an end, and ultimately the universe will collapse back
on itself. Following this "Big Crunch," it could explode again,
giving rise to another universe. In the quantum uncertainties
that dominate the supercrunched state, almost infinite possibili
ties exist for universe creation. This could account for the fine
tuned features of our universe since, given a sufficiently large
number of successive universe-creating oscillations, even the
improbable fine-tuning of a universe such as ours has a chance
of coming about.
It is also possible that many universes come into being at the
same time. This, in turn, is the case if the explosion that gave
rise to them was "reticular" - made up of a number of individ
ual regions. In the Russian-born cosmologist Andrei Linde's
inflation theory, the Big Bang had distinct regions, much like a
soap bubble in which smaller bubbles are stuck together. As
such a bubble is blown up, the smaller bubbles become sepa
rated and each forms a distinct bubble of its own. The bubble
universes percolate outward and follow their own evolutionary
destiny. Each bubble universe hits on its own set of physical con
stants, and these may be very different from those of other uni
verses. For example, in some universes gravity may be so strong
that they recollapse almost instantly; in others, gravity may be
so weak that no stars could form. We happen to live in a bub
ble tuned in such a way that complex systems, including
humans, could evolve in it.
New universes could also be created inside black holes. The
extreme high densities of these space-time regions represent



Enter the Akashic Field 67
"singularities" where the known laws of physics do not apply.
Stephen Hawking and Alan Guth suggested that under these
conditions the black hole's region of space-time detaches itself
from the rest and expands to create a universe of its own.
In another scenario, baby universes are periodically created
in bursts similar to that which brought forth our own universe.
The QSSC (Quasi-Steady State Cosmology) advanced by Fred
Hoyle together with George Burbidge and J. V. Narlikar postu
lates that such "matter-creating events" are interspersed
throughout the meta-universe. Matter-creating events come
about in the strong gravitational fields associated with dense
aggregates of preexisting matter, such as in the nuclei of galax
ies. The most recent burst occurred some fourteen billion years
ago, in excellent agreement with the latest observations regard
ing the age of our own universe.
Yet another Metaverse scenario is the work of Ilya Prigogine
and his colleagues J. Geheniau, E. Gunzig, and P. Nardone. Their
theory agrees with the QSSC in suggesting that major matter
creating bursts similar to our Big Bang occur from time to time.
The large-scale geometry of space-time creates a reservoir of
"negative energy" (which is the energy required to lift a body
away from the direction of its gravitational pull); from this reser
voir, gravitating matter extracts positive energy. Thus gravitation
is at the root of the ongoing synthesis of matter: it produces a
perpetual matter-creating mill. The more particles are generated,
the more negative energy is produced and then transferred as
positive energy to the synthesis of still more particles. Given that
the quantum vacuum is unstable in the presence of gravitational
interaction, matter and vacuum form a self-generating feedback
loop. A critical matter triggered instability causes the vacuum to
transit to the inflationary mode, and that mode marks the begin
ning of a new era of matter synthesis.
A recent Metaverse scenario is the work of Paul J. Steinhardt,



68 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
of Princeton, and Neil Turok, of Cambridge. Their cosmology
accounts for all the facts accounted for by the Big Bang theory
and also gives an explanation of the puzzling accelerating
expansion of distant galaxies. According to Steinhardt and
Turok, the universe - which is effectively the Metaverse
undergoes an endless sequence of cosmic epochs, each of which
begins with a "Bang" and ends in a "Crunch." Each cycle
includes a period of gradual and then further accelerating expan
sion, followed by reversal and the beginning of an epoch of con
traction. They estimate that at present we are about fourteen
billion years into the current cycle and at the beginning of a
trillion-year period of accelerated expansion. Ultimately our uni
verse (which is our cycle of the Metaverse) will achieve the con
dition of homogeneity, flatness, and energy needed to begin the
next cycle. In this model the Metaverse is infinite and flat, rather
than finite and closed, as in the oscillating universe models.
The great variety of cosmological scenarios advanced today indi
cates on the one hand that there is no definitive consensus yet regard
ing the birth and evolution of our universe. But on the other hand it
tells us that fables of the Metaverse make sense: it is entirely reasonable
to believe that this universe is not "all there is." There is also a meta
universe that is the originating ground, the quasi-permanent and possi
bly infinite womb of the universe we observe and inhabit.
Metaverse cosmologies have enormous explanatory potential. They
can explain in principle how our universe came by the remarkable
properties it actually has. Such an explanation is needed, because a uni
verse such as ours - with galaxies and stars, and life on this and pre
sumably other life-supporting planets - is not likely to have come about
as a matter of serendipity. According to Roger Penrose's calculations,
the probability of hitting on our universe by a random selection from



Enter the Akasbic Field 69
among the alternative-universe possibilities is one in 1010123. This is an
inconceivably large number, indicating an improbability of astronomi
cal dimensions. Indeed, Penrose himself speaks of the birth of our uni
verse as a "singularity" where the laws of physics do not hold.
But if our particular universe is so staggeringly improbable, how
did it come about? The explanation we can derive from Metaverse cos
mologies is simple and powerful. We know that the vacuum fluctua
tions that preceded the birth of our universe were precisely such that a
life-bearing universe could come about. We also know that these fluc
tuations were not created by the primal explosion known as the Big
Bang - that stupendous event only amplified them. The fluctuations
that led to our staggeringly coherent universe were already present
when our universe was born; they were there in its vacuum "pre
space." In light of the new Metaverse cosmologies, we need not assume
that they were there as a matter of pure serendipity, nor do we have to
apply to a transcendental force or agency for selecting them. As we shall
discuss in the next chapters, the selection of just the right fluctuations
was very likely due to the information conveyed to our universe from a
prior universe. This is perfectly plausible, given that the cosmic vacuum
was the womb of our universe, and that it was modulated by universes
that preceded ours. The A-field, it appears, not only creates coherence
in our universe, but also links our universe with prior universes in the
Metaverse.
2. QUANTUM PHYSICS
Quantum Puzzles: Traces of the A-Field at the Roots of Reality
At the beginning of the twentieth century, new observations and exper
iments raised questions about the most fundamental assumptions of
Newton's classical mechanics. Although the laws of motion advanced
by Newton continue to hold true under conditions at the surface of
Earth, the fundamental nature of the universe cannot be accommodated
under the heading of the classical conceptions. Space proves to be more
than a passive receptacle, and time does not flow equitably through



70 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
all eternity. Space and time have been joined by Einstein into a four
dimensional continuum, and this continuum interacts with the events
the particles of matter and light - that move about in it.
Einstein's relativity revolution took place in the first decade of the
twentieth century, and some twenty years later another revolution
occurred: the quantum revolution. This was just as fundamental as that
triggered by Einstein. Relativity theory did away with space and time as
the backdrop for the deterministic motion of mass points, but it pre
served the unambiguous description of the basic entities of the physical
universe. Quantum theory, on the other hand, did away with unam
biguous paths of motion (particles no longer appeared to move in just
one determinate way but seemed to move in a way that allows a choice
between alternative motions), and introduced indeterminacy into the
very foundations of reality (a level of freedom - or randomness - in
determining just which path a particle would follow). The mechanistic,
predictable world of classical mechanics became fuzzy. It was replaced
by a strange world that Heisenberg, Bohr, and other quantum physicists
refused to interpret in realistic terms.
Superposed wave state. The quanta of light and energy that
emerged from ever more sophisticated experiments refused to behave as
tiny equivalents of familiar objects. Their behavior proved more and
more weird. Though Einstein received the Nobel Prize for his work on
the photoelectric effect (where streams of light quanta are generated on
irradiated plates), he did not suspect - and was never ready to accept
the strangeness of the quantum world. But physicists investigating the
behavior of these packets of light and energy found that, until an instru
ment of detection or another act of observation registers them, they do
not have a specific position, nor do they occupy a unique state. The ulti
mate units of physical reality have no uniquely determinable location,
and they exist in a strange state that consists of the simultaneous
"superposition" of several ordinary states.
Newton's mass points and Democritus's atoms could be unambigu
ously defined in terms of force, position, and motion, but the quantum
cannot. Its description is complex and intrinsically ambiguous. It exists



Enter the Akasbic Field 71
in several states at the same time; this is expressed by the particle's "wave function" - the mathematical description that relates its superposed wave state to its classical space-time state. A quantum of light or energy occupies all its states at the same time - in potential. Until it is observed or registered by an instrument, it is indeterminate as to the choice among them. But as soon as it is observed or measured, its weird ability to be in several states at the same time resolves into the normal condition in which a particle is in just one state at any one time. Then, physicists say, its superposed wave function "collapses." When it does, a particle can be described in the classical manner, as an object in a single, determinate state.
Complementarity and uncertainty. Until very recently (for evidence contrary to this tenet has now surfaced), particles were believed to exhibit the property Nils Bohr called "complementarity." Depending on how they were observed and measured, particles were said to be either corpuscles or waves, but not both at the same time. The alternative properties of particles were held to be complementary: although they do not appear singly, together they fully describe the state of the particles.
To compound the mystery, the various states of particles cannot all be measured at the same time. If one measures a particle's position, for example, its momentum (which is the product of its mass and velocity) becomes indistinct; and if one measures its momentum, its position becomes blurred. This is known as Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty.
Indeterminacy and randomness. The strangeness of the particle is exacerbated by the way in which its potential states resolve into an actual state. As we have seen, in the pristine state the quantum is in a superposed state where it has neither one distinct location nor a full set of measurable properties. But when it is observed or measured, the quantum's wave function "collapses": its superposed state changes into the classical state, with unique location and full measurability. However, there are no laws of physics that can predict just which of its possible states the particle will occupy. While in the aggregate the collapse of the superposed into the singular state conforms to statistical



72 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
rules of probability, there is no way to tell just how it will unfold in a
given instance. Unless each outcome of each wave-function collapse
takes place in a separate universe (as Everett suggested), individual
multiple-state resolutions are indeterministic "quantum jumps" that are
not subject to any law of physics.
Einstein was opposed to the fundamental role of chance in nature
he said: "God doesn't play dice." Something is missing in the observa
tional and theoretical arsenal of quantum mechanics, he suggested; in
some essential respects the theory is incomplete. But Bohr countered
that the very question of what a particle is "in-itself" is not meaningful
and should not even be asked. Eugene Wigner echoed this view when
he said that quantum physics deals with observations, and not with
observables. Heisenberg also supported it when he spoke of the error of
the "philosophical doctrine of Democritus," which claims that the
whole world is made up of objectively existing material building blocks
called atoms. The world, said Heisenberg, is built as a mathematical,
and not as a material, structure. In consequence there is no use asking
to what the equations of mathematical physics refer - they do not refer
to anything beyond themselves.
Quantum Fables: Entanglement and Nonlocality
The physicist David Bohm was among the first to refuse to accept the
weird behavior of the quantum as a full description of reality. His "hid
den variables theory" suggested that the selection of the state of the
quantum is not random, but rather guided by real physical processes.
He theorized that a pilot wave called the quantum potential " Q "
emerges from a deeper, unobservable domain of the universe and guides
the observed behavior of particles. Thus, particle behavior is weird and
indeterministic only at the surface; at the deeper level it is determined
by the quantum potential. Later Bohm identified the deeper level of
reality as the "implicate order" - a holofield where all the states of the
quantum are permanently coded. Observed reality emerges from this
field by constant unfolding: it is the "explicate order."
Various versions of Bohm's theory are being developed today by



Enter the Akashic Field 73
theoretical physicists who are unwilling to take the mathematical for
malisms of quantum physics for an adequate explanation of the real
world. They account for the behavior of the quantum in reference to its
interaction with a deeper dimension of the multidimensional space
filling field that has now replaced the "luminiferous ether" of the nine
teenth century.
This is a relatively recent development. Until the 1980s, quantum
weirdness was generally accepted as an irreducible condition of the
ultrasmall domain of the universe. Physicists contented themselves with
the smooth functioning of the equations by which they computed their
observations and made predictions. In the last two decades the picture
has begun to change. With the new fables, a far less weird view of the
quantum world is beginning to take shape. Experiments that were orig
inally designed to investigate the complementary corpuscular/wave
nature of the quantum have been instrumental in bringing about the
new understanding.
The first experiment to demonstrate the wave nature of light was
conducted by Thomas Young in 1801. In his famous "double-slit exper
iments," coherent light was allowed to pass through a filtering screen
with two slits. (Young created coherent light by making a ray of sunlight
penetrate a pinhole; today, lasers are used for this purpose.) When Young
placed a second screen behind the filter with the two slits, he found that
instead of two pinpoints of light, a wave-interference pattern appeared on
the screen. The same effect can be observed on the bottom of a pool when
two drops or pebbles disturb the sunny and otherwise smooth surface of
the water. The waves spreading from each disturbance meet and interfere
with each other: where the crest of one wave meets the crest of the other,
they reinforce each other and appear bright. Where crest meets trough
they cancel each other and appear dark.
Are the quanta that pass through Young's slits waves? If so, they
could then pass through both slits and form interference patterns. This
assumption makes sense until such a weak light source is used in the
experiments that only one photon is emitted at a time. Commonsense
reasoning tells us that a single photon cannot be a wave: it must be a



74 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
corpuscular packet of energy of some sort. But then it should be able to
pass through only one of the slits and not both slits at the same time.
Yet when single photons are emitted, a wave-interference pattern builds
up on the screen, as if each photon passed through both slits.
The "split-beam" experiment, designed by John Wheeler, discloses
the same dual effect. Here, too, photons are emitted one at a time, and
they are made to travel from the emitting gun to a detector that clicks
when a photon strikes it. A half-silvered mirror is inserted along the pho
ton's path, which splits the beam. This means that on the average, one in
every two photons will pass through the mirror and one in every two will
be deflected by it. To verify this, photon counters are installed both
behind the half-silvered mirror and at right angles to it. There is no prob
lem here: the two counters register an approximately equal number of
photons. But a curious thing occurs when a second half-silvered mirror is
inserted in the path of the photons that are undeflected by the first. One
would still expect that an equal number of photons would reach the two
counters: deflection by the two mirrors would simply have exchanged
their individual destinations. But this is not the case. One of the two
counters registers all the photons - none arrives at the other.
It appears that the kind of interference that was noted in the double
slit experiment occurs in the split-beam experiment as well, indicating
that individual photons are behaving as waves. Above one of the mir
rors the interference is destructive (the phase difference between the
photons is 180 degrees), so that the wave patterns of the photons can
cel each other. Below the other mirror the interference is constructive
(since the wave phase of the photons is the same) and in consequence
the photon waves reinforce each other.
The interference of wave patterns of photons emitted moments
apart in the laboratory has also been observed in photons emitted at
considerable distances from us, at considerable intervals of time. The
"cosmological" version of the split-beam experiment bears witness to
this. In this experiment the photons are emitted not by an artificial light
source, but by a distant star. In one case the photons of the light beam
emitted by the double quasar known as 0957+516A,B were tested. This



Enter the Akashic Field 75
distant "quasi-stellar object" appears to be two, but is in fact one and
the same object, its double image being due to the deflection of its light
by an intervening galaxy situated about one fourth of the distance from
Earth. (The presence of mass, according to relativity theory, curves
space and hence also the path of the light beams that propagate in it.)
A light beam taking the curved path takes longer to travel than one
coming by the straight path. In this case the additional distance traveled
by the light deflected by the intervening galaxy means that the photons
that make up the deflected beam have been on the way fifty thousand
years longer than those that traveled by the more direct route. Although
originating billions of years ago and arriving with an interval of fifty
thousand years, the photons of the two light beams interfere with each
other just as if they had been emitted seconds apart in the laboratory.
Repeatable and indeed oft repeated experiments show that
whether they are emitted at intervals of a few seconds in the labora
tory or at intervals of thousands of years elsewhere in the
universe - particles that originate from the same source interfere with
each other. Is a photon or an electron a corpuscle when emitted (since
it can be emitted one by one) and a wave when it propagates (since it
produces wavelike interference patterns when it encounters other pho
tons or electrons)? And why does the coupling of this particle wave per
sist almost infinitely, even over cosmological distances? The search for
an answer to these questions points in a new direction.
Recent versions of the double-slit experiment furnish an indication
of the direction in which the answer is now being sought. Initially the
experiments were designed to answer a simple question: Does the parti
cle really pass through both slits, or only one? And if only one, which
one? The experiment consists of an apparatus that allows each photon
access to only one of the two slits. When a stream of photons is emit
ted and confronted with the two slits, the experiment should decide
which of the slits a given photon is passing through.
In accordance with Bohr's principle of complementarity, when the
experiment is set up so that the path of the photons can be observed,
the corpuscular face of the photons appears and the wave-face disappears:



76 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
the interference fringes diminish and can entirely vanish. The higher the
power of the "which-path detector," the more the interference fringes
diminish. This was shown by an experiment conducted by Mordehai
Heiblum, Eyal Buks, and colleagues at Israel's Weizmann Institute.
Their state-of-the-art technology comprised a device less than one
micrometer in size, which creates a stream of electrons across a barrier
on one of two paths. The paths focus the electron streams and enable
the investigators to measure the level of interference between the
streams. The higher the detector is tuned for sensitivity, the less there is
of interference. With the detector turned on for both paths, the inter
ference fringes disappear.
This result conforms to Bohr's theory, according to which the two
complementary faces of particles can never be observed at one and the
same time. However, an ingenious experiment by Shahriar Afshar, a
young Iranian-American physicist, demonstrated that even when the cor
puscular face is observed, the wave-aspect is still there: the interference
pattern does not disappear. In this experiment, reported in July 2004 by
the British journal New Scientist, a series of wires are placed precisely
where the dark fringes of the interference pattern should be. When light
hits the wires, they scatter it so that less light reaches the photon detec
tor. But light does not affect these particular points: even when photons
pass through the slits one at a time, the dark fringes are still in place.
The continued presence of the interference pattern suggests that
particles continue to behave as waves even when they are individually
emitted; only their wave-face is not apparent to conventional observa
tion. Asfhar suggests - and a number of particle physicists are inclined
to agree - that the wave-aspect of the particle is the fundamental aspect.
The corpuscular face is not the real face: the entire experiment can be
described in terms of photon-waves.
Does this mean that the mysteries surrounding the behavior of par
ticles are resolved? Not by any means. Even as a wave-state, the state
of the particle is decidedly non-commonsensical: it is "nonlocal." The
"which-path detecting apparatus" appears to be coupled in an instant
and non-energetic manner with the photons passing through the slits.



Enter the Akashic Field 77
The effect is astonishing. In some experiments the interference fringes
disappear as soon as the detector apparatus is readied - and even when
the apparatus is not turned on! Leonard Mandel's optical-interference
experiment of 1991 bears this out. In the Mandel experiment two
beams of laser light are generated and allowed to interfere. When a
detector is present that enables the path of the light to be determined,
the interference fringes disappear as Bohr predicted. But the fringes dis
appear regardless of whether or not the determination is actually car
ried out. The very possibility of "which-path-detection" destroys the
interference pattern.
This finding was confirmed in the fall of 1998, when University of
Konstanz physicists Durr, Nunn, and Rempe reported on an experiment
where interference fringes are produced by the diffraction of a beam of
cold atoms by standing waves of light. When no attempt is made to
detect which path the atoms are taking, the interferometer displays
fringes of high contrast. However, when information is encoded within
the atoms as to the path they take, the fringes vanish. The labeling of
the paths does not need to be read out to produce the disappearance of
the interference pattern; it is enough that the atoms are labeled so that
this information can be read out.
Is there an explanation for this strange finding? There is, but it is
not a commonsense one. It appears that whenever one encodes "direc
tional information" in a beam of atoms, this information correlates the
atom's momentum with its internal electronic state. Consequently when
an electronic label is attached to each of the paths the atoms can take,
the wavefunction of one path becomes orthogonal - at right angles - to
the other. And streams of atoms or photons that are orthogonal cannot
interfere with each other.
The fact is that atoms, the same as particles, can be nonlocally cor
related with each other, and even with the apparatus through which
they are measured. In itself, this is not new: nonlocality in the quantum
world has been known for more than half a century. Already in 1935
Erwin Schrodinger suggested that particles do not have individually
defined quantum states but occupy collective states. The collective



78 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
superposition of quantum states applies to two or more properties of a
single particle, as well as to a set of particles. In each case it is not the
property of a single particle that carries information, but the state of the
ensemble in which the particle is embedded. The particles themselves
are intrinsically "entangled" with each other, so that the superposed
wavefunction of the entire quantum system describes the state of each
particle within it.
NONLOCALITY: THE REVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENTS
THE EPR EXPERIMENT
The EPR experiment - the first of the revolutionary experiments
that prove the nonlocality of the microsphere of physical reality
was put forward by Albert Einstein with his colleagues Boris
Podolski and Nathan Rosen in 1935. This "thought experi
ment" (so called because at the time it could not be empirically
tested) requires that we take two particles in a so-called singlet
state, where their spins cancel out each other to yield a total spin
of zero. We then allow the particles to separate and travel a
finite distance. If we could then measure the spin states of both
particles, we would know both states at the same time. Einstein
believed that this would show that the strange limitation speci
fied in Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty is not a complete
description of physical reality.
When experimental apparatus sophisticated enough to test
this possibility could be devised, it turned out that this is not
exactly what happens. Suppose that we measure the spin state
of one of the particles - particle A - along some direction, let us
say the z-axis (the permissible spin states are "up" or "down"
along axes x, y, and z). Let us say we find that this measure
ment shows the spin to be in the direction "up." Because the



Enter the Akashic Field 79
spins of the particles have to cancel each other, the spin of
particle B must definitely be "down." But the particles are
removed from each other; this requirement should not hold.
Yet it does. Every measurement on one particle yields a com
plementary outcome in the measurement on the other. It
appears that the measurement of particle A has an instanta
neous effect on B, causing its spin wave function to collapse
into the complementary state. The measurement on A does
not merely reveal an already established state of B: it actually
produces that state.
An instantaneous effect propagates from A to B, conveying
precise information on what is being measured. B "knows"
when A is measured, for what parameter, and with what result,
for it assumes its own state accordingly. A nonlocal connection
links A and B, notwithstanding the distance that separates them.
Empirical experiments performed in the 1980s by Alain Aspect
and collaborators and repeated by Nicolas Gisin in 1997 show
that the speed with which the effect is transmitted is mind
boggling: in Aspect's experiments, the communication between
particles twelve meters apart was estimated at less than one bil
lionth of a second, about twenty times faster than the speed with
which light travels in empty space, while in Gisin's experiment,
particles ten kilometers apart appeared to be in communication
20,000 times faster than the velocity of light, relativity theory's
supposedly unbreakable speed barrier. The experiments also
show that the connection between the particles is not transmit
ted by conventional means through the measuring apparatus; it
is intrinsic to the particles themselves. The particles are
"entanged": their correlation is not sensitive either to distance
in space or to difference in time.
Subsequent experiments have involved more particles over
ever-larger distances (at the time of writing, up to forty-one kilo
meters), without modifying these surprising results. It appears



80 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
that separation does not divide particles from each other
otherwise a measurement on one would not produce an effect
on the other. It is not even necessary that the particles have orig
inated in the same quantum state, so that they originally formed
one system. Experiments show that any two particles, be they
electrons, neutrons, or photons, can originate at different points
in space and in time; if they once come together within the
same system of coordinates, that is enough for them to continue
to act as part of the same quantum system even when they are
separated . . .
THE TELEPORTATION EXPERIMENTS
Recent experiments show that a form of nonlocal connection
known as "teleportation" exists not only between individual
quanta, but also between entire atoms. Teleportation has been
experimentally proven since 1997 in regard to the quantum
state of photons in light beams and the state of magnetic fields
produced by clouds of atoms. In the spring of 2004 milestone
experiments by two teams of physicists, one at the National
Institute of Standards in Colorado and the other at the
University of Innsbruck in Austria, demonstrated that the quan
tum state of entire atoms can be teleported by transporting the
quantum bits ("qubits") that define the atoms. In the Colorado
experiment led by M.D. Barrett the ground state of beryllium
ions was successfully teleported, and in the Innsbruck experi
ment headed by M. Riebe the ground and metastable states of
magnetically trapped calcium ions were teleported. The physi
cists achieved teleportation of a remarkably high fidelity (78%
by the Colorado team and 75% by the Innsbruck team) using
different techniques, but following the same basic protocol.
First two charged atoms (ions), labeled A and B, are "entan
gled," creating the instant link that is also observed in the EPR
experiment. Then a third atom, labeled P, is prepared by encod



Enter the Akashic Field 81
ing in it the coherently superposed quantum state that is to be
teleported. Then A, one of the entangled ions, is measured
together with the prepared atom P. At that point the internal
quantum state of B transforms: it assumes the exact state that
was encoded in P! It appears that the quantum state of P has
been "teleported" to B.
Although the experiments involved complex procedures, the
real-world process they demonstrate is basic and straightforward.
When A and P are measured together, the preexisting nonlocal
connection between A and B creates a nonlocal transfer of state
from P to B. In the EPR experiment, one of a pair of entangled
particles "in-forms" the other of its measured state; similarly, in
teleportation experiments, the measurement of one of a pair of
entangled ions together with a third ion encodes the state of the
latter in the other twin. Because the process destroys the super
posed quantum state of A and re-creates it in P, it recalls science
fiction's idea of "beaming" an object from one place to another.
While beaming entire objects, not to mention people, is far
beyond the current realm of possibilities, the equivalent process
on the human level can be envisaged. In this "thought experi
ment" we take two persons who are emotionally close to each
other, let us say Archie and Betty, young people deeply in love.
We ask a third person, Petra, to concentrate on a given thought
or image. We then create a deep "transpersonal" connection
between Archie and Petra by having them pray or meditate
together. If human-level teleportation works, at the very instant
Archie and Petra enter a meditative state, the thought or image
Petra has been concentrating on vanishes from her mind, and it
reappears in the mind of Betty.
State-of-the-art teleportation experiments open vast vistas.
Even though we will not realistically be able to beam macroscale
objects or people in the foreseeable future, we could learn to
beam thoughts and images, and physicists should be able to find



82 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
ways to beam qubits not just from one atom to another, but
among a large number of particles simultaneously. This would
be the basis for a new generation of superfast quantum com
puters. When a large number of entangled particles are distrib
uted through the structure of a computer, it is expected that
"quantum teleportation" will create an instant transfer of infor
mation among them without requiring that they be wired
together or even be next to each other. The quantum computer
could also be governed from a distance, although the remote
software would have to be disposable - the instant the informa
tion it contained appeared in the computer, it would vanish at
the remote location.
In the words of physicist Nick Herbert, "[T]he essence of nonlocal
ity is unmediated action-at-a-distance. . . . A nonlocal interaction links
up one location with another without crossing space, without decay,
and without delay." This linking, according to the quantum theoretician
Henry Stapp, could be the "most profound discovery in all of science."
On first sight "action-at-a-distance" is strange (Einstein called it
"spooky"), but it is not stranger than many other aspects of the quan
tum domain. And it is a puzzle only if we fail to recognize the bona fide
physical factor that is responsible for it. Recognizing the real-world fac
tor that underlies nonlocality calls for a new paradigm in the sciences,
because the interaction involved in nonlocality is not any known form
of interaction: it does not involve the expenditure of energy, and it tran
scends the hitherto known bounds of space and time. Nonlocal interaction
is instant "informational" interaction and, as we shall discuss, it is best
viewed as the action of a physically real information-field: the A-field.

3. BIOLOGY
Puzzles of the Living State: The A-Field in the Organism
The physical world has turned out to be strange almost beyond belief,
but the world of life seems to conserve a measure of commonsense
rationality. This is not entirely so, however. The living organism is not
a mere biochemical machine. As the experimental biophysicist Mae
Wan Ho pointed out, it is dynamic and fluid, its myriad activities self
motivated, self-organizing, and spontaneous. Local freedom and global
cohesion are maximized; part and whole are mutually implicated and
mutually entangled.
Whole-system coherence. The coherence of the organism is quin
tessentially pluralistic and diverse at every level, from the tens of thou
sands of genes and hundreds of thousands of proteins and other
macromolecules that make up a cell, to the many kinds of cells that
constitute tissues and organs. There are no controlling and controlled
parts or levels; all components are in instant and continuous communi
cation. As a result the adjustments, responses, and changes required for
the maintenance of the organism propagate in all directions at the same
time. This kind of instant, system-wide correlation cannot be produced
solely by physical or even chemical interactions among molecules,
genes, cells, and organs. Though some biochemical signaling - for
example, of control genes - is remarkably efficient, the speed with
which activating processes spread in the body, as well as the complex
ity of these processes, makes reliance on biochemistry alone insuffi
cient. The conduction of signals through the nervous system, for
example, cannot proceed faster than about twenty meters per second,
and it cannot carry a large number of diverse signals at the same time.
Yet there is evidence that the entire organism is subtly but effectively
interlinked; there are quasi-instant, nonlinear, heterogeneous, and multi
dimensional correlations among all its parts.
No matter how diverse the cells, organs, and organ systems of the
organism, in essential respects they act as one. According to Mae-Wan
Ho they behave like a good jazz band, where every player responds
immediately and spontaneously to however the others are improvising.



84 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
The super jazz band of an organism never ceases to play in a lifetime,
expressing the harmonies and melodies of the individual organism with
a recurring rhythm and beat but with endless variations. Always there
is something new, something made up, as it goes along. It can change
key, change tempo, or change tune, as the situation demands, sponta
neously and without hesitation. There is structure, but the real art is in
the endless improvisations, where each and every player, however
small, enjoys maximum freedom of expression, while remaining per
fectly in step with the whole.
The "music" of a higher organism ranges over more than seventy
octaves. It is made up of the vibration of localized chemical bonds, the
turning of molecular wheels, the beating of micro-cilia, the propagation
of fluxes of electrons and protons, and the flowing of metabolites and
ionic currents within and among cells through ten orders of spatial
magnitude.
The level of coherence discovered in the organism suggests that in
some respects it is a macroscopic quantum system. Living tissue is a
"Bose-Einstein condensate": a form of matter in which quantum-type
processes, hitherto believed to be limited to the microscopic domain,
occur at macroscopic scales. That they do has been verified in 1995, in
experiments for which the physicists Eric A. Cornell, Wolfgang Ketterle,
and Carl E. Wieman received the 2001 Nobel Prize. The experiments
show that under certain conditions, seemingly separate particles and
atoms interpenetrate as waves. For example, rubidium and sodium
atoms behave not as classical particles but as nonlocal quantum waves,
penetrating throughout the given condensate and forming interference
patterns.
The system-wide coherence of the organism provides further evi
dence for the quantum postulate. It is known that correlation can occur
between distant molecules and molecular assemblies only when they
resonate at the same or compatible frequencies. Whether the force that
appears among such assemblies is attractive or repulsive depends on the
given phase relations. For cohesion to occur among the assemblies, they
have to resonate in phase - the same wave function must apply to them.



Enter the Akashic Field 85
This provision applies also to the coupling of frequencies among the
assemblies. If faster and slower reactions are to accommodate them
selves within a coherent overall process, the respective wave functions
must coincide. They do in fact coincide, and as a consequence quantum
biologists can speak of a "macroscopic wave function" that applies to
the organism as a whole.
Superconductivity. In the living organism, processes suggestive of
superconductivity appear at macroscopic scales and normal tempera
tures. The detailed mechanism underlying these phenomena is the sub
ject of intense research. Hans-Peter Durr, former Heisenberg disciple
and at the time of writing head of Germany's Max Planck Institute of
Physics, explored an explanation in reference to the electromagnetic
radiation that surrounds electrons in biomolecules. Consisting of bil
lions of atoms, biomolecules resonate at frequencies between 100 and
1,000 gigahertz. Their longitudinal oscillations are linked to periodic
charge displacements, giving rise to the radiation of electromagnetic
waves of the same frequency. Durr speculated that such specifically
modulated carrier waves could interlink biomolecules, cells, and even
entire organisms, whether they are contiguous or at considerable dis
tance from each other. The process would be similar to superconduc
tivity at very low temperatures, but it could occur at ordinary body
temperature in warm-blooded animals.
Durr concluded that - since according to quantum physics everything
is included and incorporated in one indivisible potential reality - it should
be possible to find many kinds of connecting links among phenomena.
Some of these links may have less the character of a transmission of infor
mation between separate things that vibrate at the same frequency (as his
own speculations suggest) than the character of a genuinely nonlocal
"communion" among seemingly separate but in reality deeply entangled
particles and atoms, and the things constituted of them.
Biological Fables: The Interconnected Web of Life
As we have already remarked, Darwin postulated a full and complete
separation between genome and phenome, the genetic information



86 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
coded in the DNA of the organism's cells, and the environmental influ
ences that reach the organism built according to its genetic information.
The genome was said to mutate randomly, unaffected by the vicissi
tudes that befall the phenome.
The idea that random mutations and natural selection are the basic
mechanism of evolution was introduced in 1859, a full century before
the nature of the hereditary material would be elucidated together with
the specific mechanism by which heritable traits are transmitted. The
identification of genes made up of strands of DNA came still later, fol
lowed by the discovery of the various modalities of mutation and
rearrangement in the genome. The structure of genes in multicellular
organisms was clarified in the late 1970s, sufficient DNA sequences to
enable the analysis of the origin of genes became available in the 1980s,
and the mapping of entire genomes began in the 1990s. Nevertheless,
the basic mechanism of evolution described by Darwin was maintained
unchanged. The "synthetic theory," the modern version of Darwinism,
still insists that randomly produced genetic mutations and the chance
fit of the mutants to the milieu evolve one species into another by pro
ducing new genes and new developmental genetic pathways, coding
new and viable organic structures, body parts, and organs.
Yet random rearrangements within the genome are entirely
unlikely to produce viable species. The "search space" of possible
genetic rearrangements within the genome is so enormous that random
processes are likely to take incomparably longer to produce new
species than the time that was available for evolution on this planet.
The probabilities are made a great deal worse by the consideration that
many organisms, and many organs within organisms, are "irreducibly
complex." A system is irreducibly complex, said the biologist Michael
Behe, if its parts are interrelated in such a way that removing even one
part destroys the function of the whole system. To mutate an irre
ducibly complex system into another viable system, every part has to
be kept in a functional relationship with every other part throughout
the entire transformation. Missing but a single part at a single step
leads to a dead end. How could this level of constant precision be



Enter the Akashic Field 87
achieved by random piecemeal modifications of the genetic pool?
An isolated genome working through randomly generated muta
tions is not likely to produce a new and functional mutant. If such a
mutant is in fact produced - and produced time and time again in the
course of evolution - the mutation of the genome must be precisely cor
related with conditions in the organism's environment. This correlation
was often suspected, but in the twentieth century it was dismissed as a
mysterious form of "pre-adaptation" - the idea that mutants are some
how spontaneously tuned to the conditions a given species finds in its
milieu. Yet unless mutations in the genome are in fact precisely tuned
to conditions in their milieu, the resulting mutants will not survive: they
will be eliminated by natural selection.
How is it, then, that complex mutants have not been eliminated - how
could the biosphere be populated by millions of species more complex
than algae and bacteria? This could be only if mutations in the genome
are highly and quasi-instantly responsive to the environing conditions
that affect the organism - if genes and environments form an intercon
nected system. Evidence is now available that this is indeed the case.
The evidence is statistical, and it goes back to the beginnings of life
on this planet. The oldest rocks date from about four billion years,
while the earliest and already highly complex forms of life (blue-green
algae and bacteria) are over three and a half billion years old. Because
even the simplest forms of life manifest a staggering complexity, if the
existing species had relied on chance mutations alone, this level of com
plexity is not likely to have emerged within the relatively short period
of about 500 million years. After all, the assembly of a primitive self
replicating prokaryote (primitive nonnucleated cell) is already a complex
undertaking. It involves building a double helix of DNA consisting of
some 100,000 nucleotides, with each nucleotide containing an exact
arrangement of thirty to fifty atoms, together with a bilayered skin and
the proteins that enable the cell to take in food. This construction
requires an entire series of reactions, finely coordinated with each other.
It is not enough for genetic mutations to produce one or a few pos
itive changes in a species; they must produce the full set. The evolution



88 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
of feathers, for example, does not produce a reptile that can fly: radical
changes in musculature and bone structure are also required, along
with a faster metabolism to power sustained flight. Each innovation by
itself is not likely to offer evolutionary advantage; on the contrary, it is
likely to make an organism less fit than the standard form from which
it departed. And if so, it would soon be eliminated by the pitiless mech
anisms of natural selection. The cosmologist and mathematical physi
cist Fred Hoyle has pointed out that life evolving purely by chance is
about as likely as a hurricane blowing through a scrap yard assembling
a working airplane.
THE BLIND MAN AND THE RUBIK'S CUBE
Fred Hoyle gave a striking example to show why a random
selection among even a modest number of alternatives is likely
to take far too long to produce usable results. Assume that a
blind man is trying to order the scrambled colored faces of a
Rubik's Cube. (This is a cube of which the six faces are subdi
vided into three color-coded sections each. The colors can be
ordered by twisting the individual segments.) The blind man is
handicapped by not knowing whether any twist he gives the
cube brings him closer to or farther from his goal of ordering the
sections of the cube. He is obliged to work by random trial and
error, with the result that his chances of achieving a simultane
ous color matching of the six faces of the cube are in the range
of 1:1 to l:5xl018. If the blind man is to work through all the
possible moves at the rate of one move per second, he will need
5xl018 seconds. This, however, he could not do, for 5xl018 sec
onds is 126 billion years - almost ten times more than the age of
our universe!
The situation changes dramatically if the blind man receives
prompting in his efforts. If he receives a correct "yes" or "no"
prompt at each move, the laws of probability show that he will



Enter the Akashic Field 89
unscramble the cube at an average of 120 moves. Working at
the rate of one move per second, he will need not 126 billion
years to reach his goal, but two minutes.
Already in 1937, the biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky noted that
the sudden origin of a new species by gene mutation might be an impos
sibility in practice. "Races of a species, and to a still greater extent
species of a genus," he wrote, "differ from each other in many genes,
and usually also in the chromosome structure. A mutation that would
catapult a new species into being must, therefore, involve simultaneous
changes in many gene loci, and in addition some chromosomal recon
struction. With the known mutation rates the probability of such an
event is negligible." Yet Dobzhansky did not give up the Darwinian the
ory; instead, he assumed that species formation is a slow and gradual
process, occurring on a "quasi-geological scale."
However, the assumption of slow and gradual evolution was con
tradicted in the 1970s by the finding of new fossils: these show that the
"missing links" that appear in the fossil record are not due to the
incompleteness of the record, but are true jumps in the course of evo
lution. New species do not arise through a stepwise modification of
existing species - they appear almost all at once. This finding prompted
Stephen Jay Gould, then of Harvard, and Niles Eldredge, of the
American Museum of Natural History, to advance the theory of "punc
tuated equilibrium." In this macroevolutionary theory, new species
arise in a time span of no more than five to ten thousand years. This
may seem like a long time to humans, but as Gould and Eldredge point
out, "[I]t translates into geological time as an instant."
The genome must be linked in some way with the milieu in which
a species lives, for only such linkage can provide that timesaving
"prompt" that allows living species to overcome mutational dead
ends and evolve into viable new species. Experimental data back up the
statistical evidence. As noted in chapter 3, linkages exist between the



90 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
phenome and the genome, and they can be mechanical, chemical, bio
chemical, or field-transmitted. Electromagnetic and quantum fields act
on the supersensitive organism, and they, too, can trigger adaptive
mutations in the genome. Quantum fields appear to link all parts of the
organism within the whole organism, and they may also link the whole
organism with its external environment. The fact is that the organism
is amazingly coherent in itself, and is coherently linked with the world
around it.
The coherence of the organism with its environment appears to
bring back some aspects of Lamarckism, according to which acquired
characteristics can be inherited - what befalls the organism in its milieu
can be handed down to its offspring. Although the new findings are not
a rediscovery of classical Lamarckism (because characteristics acquired
by an organism can be handed down to the offspring only through a
modification of the genome), they nevertheless have revolutionary impli
cations. Not surprisingly, the scientific fables that attempt to account for
them encounter vivid resistance. Only now do the best-conceived fables
command serious attention at the cutting edge of biological research,
where systemic biology meets quantum physics in the fledgling disci
pline known as quantum biology.
There is now a fable that is entirely logical and highly supported
by evidence: it is that the organism is in some essential respects a
quantum system. Being a quantum system, it is linked to other organ
isms as well as to its vital environment much as quanta are linked
through space and time: through the A-field, the information field of
the vacuum.
4. CONSCIOUSNESS RESEARCH
Puzzles of Transpersonal Consciousness: Intimations of the A-field in the Human Mind
Research on consciousness has become fashionable. There are research
institutes, university faculties, scientific journals, and entire book series
dedicated to its investigation. Quantum brain researchers look into the



Enter the Akashic Field 91
interaction of consciousness with the physical world, making use of
advanced quantum concepts such as nonlocality, entanglement, phase
relations, and hyperspace, among others. The attention of investigators
in psychoneuroimmunology, psychosomatic medicine, and other forms
of biofeedback research centers on the connection between conscious
ness and bodily processes, while courageous scientists investigating
diverse altered states of consciousness examine the effects of dreams,
psychedelic substances, trance, and meditative states, on the assump
tion that these disclose important and otherwise hidden aspects not
only of the subject's own consciousness, but also of his or her links with
the outside world. Still more far-flung investigations focus on the effect
on consciousness of nonconventional forms of energy known tradition
ally as prana, kundalini, and chi.
The burgeoning branches of consciousness research use diverse
methodologies, but they come to remarkably similar conclusions. The
common thrust of their findings is that the human mind is not an iso
lated entity. To use an expression made popular by Gregory Bateson, it
is an "ecology." Consciousness is not fully possessed by the individual,
but is present throughout society and perhaps humanity as a whole.
Transpersonal connections. The brains/minds of individual human
beings appear to be subtly but effectively linked. So-called primitive
peoples have long known of such "transpersonal" links. Medicine men
and shamans can induce powers of telepathy through solitude, concen
tration, fasting, chanting, dancing, drumming, or psychedelic herbs.
Whole clans are able to remain in touch with each other no matter
where their members roam. Australian Aborigines, the anthropologist
A. P. Elkin found, are informed of the fate of family and friends even
when they are beyond the range of sensory communication with them.
A man far from his homeland will announce that his father is dead, or
that his wife has given birth, or that there is some trouble in his coun
try. He is so sure of his facts that he is ready to return home at once.
Many tribal peoples, Mario Morgan noted, are able to receive input
from their environment, do something unique in decoding it, and then
consciously act almost as if they had developed some tiny celestial



92 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
receiver through which they receive universal messages. Modern people
have lost everyday access to this "celestial receiver" but laboratory exper
iments show that they have not lost the receiver itself. Under the right
conditions, most people can become aware of the vague but meaningful
images, intuitions, and feelings that testify that they are "in touch" with
other people and with some aspects of the environment, even when they
are beyond the reach of eye, ear, palate, smell, and touch.
Transpersonal contact between individuals has been reported by var
ious psychology and parapsychology laboratories. Thought and image
transference experiments have involved distances between sender and
receiver ranging from half a mile to several thousand miles. Regardless of
where they have been carried out and by whom, the success rate has been
considerably above random probability. The receivers usually report a
preliminary impression as a gentle and fleeting form. This form gradually
evolves into a more integrated image. The image itself is experienced as a
surprise, both because it is clear and because it is clearly elsewhere.
Beyond thought and image transference, a related and apparently
likewise universal transpersonal ability is to synchronize the electrical
activity of one's brain with the brain of others. A series of experiments
carried out by the Italian physician and brain researcher Nitamo
Montecucco and witnessed by this writer showed that in deep medita
tion, the left and right hemispheres of the brain manifest identical wave
patterns. Still more remarkably, the left and right hemispheres of dif
ferent subjects become synchronized. In one test, eleven out of twelve
meditators achieved a remarkable ninety-eight percent synchronization
of their full EEG waves in the complete absence of sensory contact
among them.
Another experiment carried out in the presence of the writer took
place in southern Germany in the spring of 2001. At a seminar attended
by about a hundred people, Dr. Gunther Haffelder, head of the Institute
for Communication and Brainresearch of Stuttgart, measured the EEG
patterns of Dr. Maria Sagi, a trained psychologist and gifted natural
healer, together with that of a young man who volunteered among the
participants. The young man remained in the seminar hall while the



Enter the Akasbic Field 93
healer was taken to a separate room. Both the healer and the young
man were wired with electrodes, and their EEG patterns were projected
onto a large screen in the hall. The healer attempted to diagnose and
then heal the health problems experienced by the subject, who sat with
closed eyes in a light meditative state. During the time the healer was
concentrating on her task, her EEG waves dipped into the deep Delta
region (between 0 and 3 Hz per second), with a few sudden eruptions
of wave amplitude. This was surprising in itself, because when some
one's brain waves descend into the Delta region, he or she is usually
asleep. But the healer was fully awake, even if in a deeply relaxed state.
Even more surprising was that the test subject exhibited the same Delta
wave pattern - it showed up in his EEG display about two seconds after
it appeared in the EEG of the healer. Yet they had no sensory contact
with each other.
Transcultural connections. Anthropological as well as laboratory
evidence speaks to the reality of transpersonal connection among indi
viduals, but this is not all. Archaeological and historical evidence testi
fies that such connection also occurs between entire peoples and
cultures.
Subtle, spontaneous contact among cultures appears to have been
widespread, as evidenced by the artifacts of different civilizations. In
widely different locations and at different historical times, ancient cul
tures developed an array of similar artifacts and buildings. Although
each culture added its own embellishments, Aztecs and Etruscans,
Zulus and Malays, classical Indians and ancient Chinese built their
monuments and fashioned their tools as if following a shared pattern.
Giant pyramids were built in ancient Egypt as well as in pre-Columbian
America, with remarkable agreement in design. The Acheulian hand ax,
a widespread tool of the Stone Age, had a typical almond or tear-shaped
design chipped into symmetry on both sides. In Europe this ax was
made of flint, in the Middle East of chert, and in Africa of quartzite,
shale, or diabase. Its basic form was functional, yet the agreement in the
details of its execution in virtually all traditional cultures cannot be
explained by the simultaneous discovery of utilitarian solutions to a



94 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
shared need: trial and error is not likely to have produced such similar
ity of detail in so many far-flung populations.
Crafts, such as pottery making, took much the same form in all cul
tures. At this writer's suggestion, the University of Bologna historian
Ignazio Masulli made an in-depth study of the pots, urns, and other
artifacts produced by indigenous and independently evolving cultures
in Europe, as well as in Egypt, Persia, India, and China during the
period from the fifth to the second millennia B.C.E. Masulli found strik
ing recurrences in the basic forms and designs but could not come up
with a conventional explanation for them. The civilizations lived far
apart in space and sometimes also in time, and did not seem to have had
conventional forms of contact with each other.
FOUR PIONEERING TRANSPERSONAL EXPERIMENTS
1. Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, two physicists, undertook
one of the first experiments in controlled transpersonal
thought and image transference in the early 1970s. They
placed the "receiver" in a sealed, opaque, and electrically
shielded chamber and the "sender" in another room where he
or she was subjected to bright flashes of light at regular inter
vals. The brain-wave patterns of both sender and receiver
were registered on electroencephalograph (EEG) machines.
As expected, the sender exhibited the rhythmic brain waves
that normally accompany exposure to bright flashes of light.
However, after a brief interval, the receiver also began to pro
duce the same patterns, although he or she was not being
directly exposed to the flashes and was not receiving ordinary
sense-perceivable signals from the sender.
Targ and Puthoff also conducted experiments on remote
viewing. In these tests, distances that precluded any form of
sensory communication between them separated sender and



Enter the Akashic Field 95
receiver. At a site chosen at random, the sender acted as a
"beacon" and the receiver tried to pick up what the sender
saw. To document their impressions, receivers gave verbal
descriptions, sometimes accompanied by sketches.
Independent judges found the descriptions of the sketches
matched the characteristics of the site that was actually seen
by the sender on average sixty-six percent of the time.
2. In another experiment, in 1994, two physicists, Peter Stewart
and Michael Brown, in England, joined with Helen Stewart,
a university administrator in New York, to test the telepathic
procedure suggested by "Seth" and recounted by Jane
Roberts in her best-selling books. Communication was
attempted across the Atlantic in fourteen accurately timed
sessions between April and September of that year. Detailed
records of the observations and impressions were made after
each experience via e-mail, and they were stored on auto
matically dated and timed disks. Though the remotely viewed
images were described in terms of associations rather than
exact pictorial reproductions of what was seen by the sender,
on the whole they corresponded to it. The picture of a meteor
shower, for example, came through as a snowstorm; the
image of a tower with a rotating restaurant on top was
picked up as a globe on a stand. Static images as well as
dynamic sequences of images were received - "still pictures"
as well as "moving pictures." The physicists concluded that
the validity of the telepathic procedure reported by Jane
Roberts is established beyond reasonable doubt.
3. The third series of pioneering experiments is the work of
Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum, of the National University of
Mexico. He performed more than fifty experiments over five
years on spontaneous communication among individual test
subjects. He paired his subjects inside soundproof and elec
tromagnetic radiation-proof "Faraday cages" and asked



96 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
them to meditate together for twenty minutes. Then he
placed them in separate Faraday cages where one subject was
stimulated and the other not. The stimulated subject received
stimuli at random intervals in such a way that neither he (or
she) nor the experimenter knew when they were applied. The
subjects who were not stimulated remained relaxed, with
eyes closed, instructed to feel the presence of the partner
without knowing anything about his or her stimulation.
Typically, a series of one hundred stimuli were applied
such as flashes of light, sounds, and short, intense, but not
painful electric shocks to the index and ring fingers of the
right hand. The electroencephalograph (EEG) brain-wave
records of both subjects were then synchronized and exam
ined for "normal" potentials evoked in the stimulated subject
and "transferred" potentials in the non-stimulated one.
Transferred potentials were not found in control situations
where there was no stimulated subject, when a screen pre
vented the stimulated subject from perceiving the stimuli (such
as light flashes), or when the two subjects did not previously
interact. But during experimental situations with stimulated
subjects and with prior contact among them, the transferred
potentials appeared consistently in about twenty-five percent
of the cases. A young couple, deeply in love, furnished a par
ticularly poignant example. Their EEG patterns remained
closely synchronized throughout the experiment, testifying
that their report of feeling deep oneness was not an illusion.
In a limited way, Grinberg-Zylberbaum could also repli
cate his results. When one individual exhibited the trans
ferred potentials in one experiment, he or she usually
exhibited them in subsequent experiments also. The results
did not depend on spatial separation between senders and
receivers - the transferred potentials appeared no matter how
far or how near they were to each other.



Enter the Akashic Field 97
4. The fourth experiment is particularly intriguing: it involves
dowsing. It is known that dowsers can often pinpoint the
location of water veins with great accuracy. Dowsing rods as
well as pendulums respond to the presence of underground
water, magnetic fields, and even oil and other natural sub
stances. (Evidently, it is not the dowsing rod itself that
responds to the presence of water and other things, but the
brain and nervous system of the person who holds the rods,
for the rods do not move unless they are held by a dowser.
The rods merely make the information visible: they enlarge
the subtle and involuntary muscle responses that move the
arm of the dowser.) It now appears that dowsers can also
pick up information that is not produced by natural causes
but is projected long-distance by the mind of another person.
"Dowsable" lines, figures, and shapes can be created by the
conscious intention of one person, and these lines, figures,
and shapes affect the mind and body of distant persons who
have not been told what has been created and where. Their
rods move just as if the figures, lines, and shapes were due to
natural causes immediately in front of them. This is the find
ing of a series of remote-dowsing experiments carried out in
the past ten years by Jeffrey Keen, a renowned engineer,
together with colleagues at the Dowsing Research Group of
the British Society of Dowsers.
In a considerable number of experiments, the exact shapes
created by the experimenter could be identified by the
dowsers. It turned out that the shapes could be positioned
with an accuracy of a few inches even when created thou
sands of miles away. The accuracy of positioning was not
affected by the distance between the person creating the
dowsable fields and the physical location of the fields: the
same results were produced whether the experimenter cre
ated a dowsable shape a few inches or five thousand miles



98 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
away. There was no difference whether the experimenter
stood on the ground, was in an underground cave, flew in a
plane, or was inside a Faraday cage. Time did not seem to be
a factor either: the fields were created faster than measure
ments could be taken, even over large distances. Time also
proved irrelevant because the fields remained present and sta
ble at all times after their creation. In one case they endured
for more than three years. But they could be canceled if the
person who created them wanted it.
Keen concluded that dowsable fields are created and main
tained in an "Information Field that pervades the universe."
The brain interacts with this field and perceives dowsable
fields as holograms. This, according to Keen and the
Dowsing Research Group, is an instance of nonlocal interac
tion between the brain and the field by different and even dis
tant individuals.
NDEs and other altered-state-of-consciousness experiences. There is
now a significant body of evidence that the range of information reach
ing brain and consciousness transcends the range coming through eyes
and ears. A remarkable kind of evidence comes from the investigations of
Kenneth Ring, a British near-death-experience (NDE) researcher. Not
content with finding evidence of veridical out-of-body experiences by
ordinary people at the portals of death (well documented ever since
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross began researching the NDE phenomenon), Ring
investigated such experiences in blind people.
In one series of tests, fifteen out of twenty-one blind people whose
physical condition approached death reported fully sighted visions.
(Of the remaining six, three were not sure whether they saw or not,
and three did not appear to see at all.) Among those who reported
sighted visions, Ring found no obvious differences whether they had
been blind from birth, had lost sight later in life, or suffered from



Enter the Akashic Field 99
severe visual impairment. Furthermore, the experiences they reported
were much the same as those reported by sighted people. Ring tried to
explain these findings by the usual skeptical arguments, such as: that
they are only apparent and not actual; that they are similar to dreams;
that they constitute retrospective reconstructions of prior experiences;
and that they are a form of "blindsight" due to receptors in the brain
or on the skin. However, he found that no such explanation can
account for the clear visual features of the experiences, or indeed for
the finding that many of their features were subsequently confirmed as
veridical perception.
NDEs occur in altered states of consciousness, as do other forms of
out-of-body experiences. Meditation, intense prayer, fasting, rhythmic
movements, and controlled breathing also produce altered states, and
all these states prove conducive to the reception of nonsensory infor
mation. When consciousness is in an altered state, the brain seems to
function in a mode in which information that does not fit the com
monsense conception of the world is not repressed. By contrast, ordi
nary waking consciousness is a strict censor: most people have been
"brainwashed" to filter out all experiences not clearly and evidently
conveyed by eyes and ears. Parents tell their children not to imagine
things, teachers insist that they should stop dreaming and be sensible,
and peer groups, already brainwashed, laugh at the child who persists.
As a result, modern youngsters grow up to be commonsense individu
als for whom everything that does not accord with the dominant mate
rialist idea of the world is denied and repressed. In altered states of
consciousness, however, strange items enter consciousness. And not
everything that enters turns out to be imaginary . . .
The ability of altered states to convey veridical information about
the world was known to traditional peoples who prized and cultivated
them for the power they confer. But modern people think of altered
states as pathological - a sign of disease, of dementia, or of being high
on drugs. Only dreaming, daydreaming, alcoholic intoxication, and
sexual orgasm are considered "normal" deviations from waking con
sciousness. Natural healers, leading-edge psychiatrists, and consciousness



100 The Quest for an integral Theory of Everything
researchers have a different view of such states. The psychiatrist John
Nelson, for example, considers altered states basic to the human psy
che, with one end of the spectrum shading into madness and the other
reaching to the loftiest realms of creativity, insight, and genius.
In over forty years of clinical experience, the renowned psychiatrist
Stanislav Grof investigated the power of altered states. Gathered in more
than four thousand psychedelic sessions with various mind-altering
substances, two thousand sessions conducted by colleagues, and over
thirty thousand sessions using the holotropic breathing method, Grof's
experience indicates that when the censorship of the waking conscious
ness is not operative, information can reach the mind from almost any
part or aspect of the universe.
For example, in the "experience of dual unity," a person in an
altered state of consciousness can experience a loosening and melting of
the boundaries of the body ego and a sense of merging with another per
son in a state of unity and oneness. In this experience, despite the feeling
of being fused with another, one retains an awareness of one's own iden
tity. In the experience of "identification with other persons," an individ
ual, while merging experientially with someone else, can experience
complete identification to the point of losing the awareness of his or her
own identity. Identification is total and complex, involving body image,
physical sensations, emotional reactions and attitudes, thought
processes, memories, facial expressions, typical gestures and manner
isms, postures, movement, and even the inflection of the voice. The per
son with whom the given individual identifies can be someone in his or
her presence or it can be a distant person, alive now or long since dead.
In "group identification and group consciousness" there is a further
extension of consciousness and melting of ego boundaries. Rather than
identifying with an individual, a person can have a sense of becoming
an entire group of people with some shared racial, cultural, national,
ideological, political, or professional characteristic. Identification can
focus on a social or political group, the people of an entire country or
continent, all members of a race, or all believers of a religion. The depth,
scope, and intensity of this experience can reach extraordinary propor

tions: some people experience the totality of suffering of all the soldiers
who have ever died on the battlefield since the beginning of history; the
desire of revolutionaries of all ages to overthrow a tyrant; or the love, ten
derness, and dedication of all mothers in regard to their babies.
Telesomatic connections. Transpersonal and transcultural effects are
not limited to contact and communication between the minds of differ
ent, and possibly distant, people: effects can be transmitted also from the
mind of one person to the body of another. This "telesomatic" effect was
likewise known to traditional cultures; anthropologists called it "sympa
thetic magic." At the University of Nevada, the experimental parapsy
chologist Dean Radin tested it under controlled laboratory conditions.
In Radin's experiments, the subjects created a small doll in their
own image and provided various objects (pictures, jewelry, an autobi
ography, and personally meaningful tokens) to "represent" them. They
also gave a list of what makes them feel nurtured and comfortable.
These items and the accompanying information were used by the
"healer" - who functioned analogously to the "sender" in thought- and
image-transfer experiments - to create a sympathetic connection to the
"patient." The latter was wired up to monitor the activity of his or her
autonomous nervous system (electrodermal activity, heart rate, and
blood pulse volume) while the healer was in an acoustically and elec
tromagnetically shielded room in an adjacent building. The healer
placed the doll and other small objects on the table in front of him and
concentrated on them while sending randomly sequenced "nurturing"
(active healing) and "rest" messages.
The electrodermal activity of the patients, together with their heart
rate, was significantly different during the active nurturing periods than
during the rest periods, while blood pulse volume was significant for a
few seconds during the nurturing period. Both heart rate and blood
flow indicated a "relaxation response" - which makes sense since the
healer was attempting to "nurture" the subject via the doll. On the
other hand, a higher rate of electrodermal activity showed that the
patients' autonomic nervous system was becoming aroused. Why this
should be so was puzzling, until the experimenters realized that the



102 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
healers nurtured the patients by rubbing the shoulders or stroking the
hair and face of the dolls that represented them. This, apparently, had
the effect of a "remote massage" on the skin of the patients!
Radin and colleagues concluded that the local actions and thoughts
of the healer are mimicked in the distant patient almost as if healer and
patient were next to each other. Distance between sender and receiver
seems to make no difference. This was confirmed in a large number of
trials conducted by the experimental parapsychologists William Braud
and Marilyn Schlitz regarding the impact of the mental imagery of
senders on the physiology of receivers. Braud and Schlitz found that the
mental images of the sender could reach out over space to cause
changes in the physiology of the distant receiver. The effects are com
parable to those that one's own mental processes produce on one's
body. "Telesomatic" action by a distant person is similar to, and nearly
as effective as, "psychosomatic" action by individuals on themselves.
Distant mental effect can be produced on other forms of life as well.
In a series of experiments, the lie-detector expert Cleve Backster
attached the electrodes of his lie detector to the leaves of a plant in his
New York office. He recorded the changes in electric potentials on the
surface of a leaf just as he would record such changes in a human sub
ject. To his amazement, Backster found that the plant registered his own
emotions - showing sudden jumps and wild fluctuations at the precise
moment when Backster himself had a strong emotional reaction,
whether he was in the office or away from it. Somehow, the plant
seemed to "read" his mind. Backster speculated that plants have a "pri
mary perception" of the people and events around them. Subsequently
he tested many varieties of plants, cells, and even animals and found the
same kind of response in the lie detector. The leaves of plants responded
even when they were ground up and the remains distributed over the
surface of the electrodes!
Subsequently, Backster undertook a series of experiments in which he
tested white cells (leukocytes) taken from the mouths of his test subjects.
The procedure of obtaining the cells has been perfected for purposes of
dentistry and produces a pure cell culture in a test tube. Backster moved



Enter the Akashic Field 103
the culture to a distant location, anywhere from five meters to twelve
kilometers from his subjects. He placed the electrodes of the lie detector
on the distant culture and provoked some emotion-producing response in
his subjects. In one case he had a young man look at an issue of Playboy
magazine. Nothing spectacular occurred until the young man came to the
centerfold and saw a photo of actress Bo Derek in the nude. At that
moment the needle of the lie detector attached to the distant cell culture
began to swing, and kept fluctuating as long as the subject was looking
at the picture. When he closed the magazine, the needle returned to trace
a normal pattern, but was suddenly reactivated when the young man
decided to have another look at the magazine.
In another test a former Navy gunner who was at Pearl Harbor dur
ing the Japanese attack was shown a TV program depicting the attack.
He showed no particular reaction until the face of a Navy gunner
appeared on the screen, followed by a shot of a Japanese plane falling
into the sea. At that moment the needle of the lie detector attached to
his cells twelve kilometers away jumped. Subsequently, both he and the
young man confirmed that they had a strong emotional reaction at
these particular points. It made no difference whether the cells were a
few meters or several kilometers away. The lie detector displayed
exactly the response it would have displayed if it had been attached
directly to the subject's body. Backster was forced to conclude that a
form of "biocommunication" is taking place for which we have no ade
quate explanation.
Psi-Fables: Nonlocal Consciousness
Psi-fables abound in the world: they are the woof and warp of the popu
lar esoteric schools. Such fables are now also produced by scientists, if only
by a handful of insightful and courageous ones. A few examples stand out.
William James, known as the father of American psychology,
declared: "Out of my experience . . . one fixed conclusion dogmatically
emerges . . . that we with our lives are like islands in the sea, or like trees
in the forest. The maple and pine may whisper to each other with their
leaves. . . . But the trees also commingle their roots in the darkness



104 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
underground, and the islands hang together through the ocean's bottom.
Just so there is a continuum of cosmic consciousness, against which our
individuality builds but accidental fences, and into which our several
minds plunge as into a mother sea or reservoir. . . . " The physicist Erwin
Schrodinger echoed a similar insight. "In all the world," he wrote, "there
is no kind of framework within which we can find consciousness in
the plural; this is simply something we construct because of the spatio
temporal plurality of individuals, but it is a false construction . . . the self
consciousness of the individual members are numerically identical both
with [each] other and with that Self which they may be said to form at a
higher level."
David Bohm came to essentially the same conclusion: "Deep down
the consciousness of mankind is one," he affirmed. "This is a virtual cer
tainty because even in the vacuum matter is one; and if we don't see this
it's because we are blinding ourselves to it." In 2001 Henry Stapp placed
the psi-fable of nonlocal consciousness in the current physics framework.
"The new physics," he remarked, "presents prima facie evidence that our
human thoughts are linked to nature by nonlocal connections: what a
person chooses to do in one region seems immediately to affect what is
true elsewhere in the universe. This nonlocal aspect can be understood by
conceiving the universe to be not a collection of tiny bits of matter, but
rather a growing compendium of 'bits of information.' "
Unless scientists are well established, psi-fables are dangerous terri
tory for them, making them a target for criticism and even censure. But
the accumulation of evidence regarding nonlocal connection between
the brains and minds of people is now so significant that even the main
stream science community is taking notice. In the spring of 2000, a col
lection of papers published by the ordinarily conservative American
Psychological Association reviewed and assessed the relevant evidence.
Edited by Etzel Cardena, Steven Jay Lynn, and Stanley Krippner,
Varieties of Anomalous Experience: Examining the Scientific Evidence

experiences, and mystical experiences. The authors agreed that these
experiences could not be dismissed either as illusory or as signs of psy
chopathology. They are more widespread than has been generally
assumed, and have a real impact on the people who experience them.
Yet, they said, there are no definitive explanations for them.
This conclusion is characteristic of the state of the art in academic
consciousness research. The nonlocal aspects of consciousness are less
and less disputed, but not significantly better understood. As the pio
neer altered-state researcher Russell Targ put it, "[I]t is all phenomena."
Since meaningful explanation is beyond the bounds of legitimate
research, the investigation of the phenomena is shifted into the domain
of "para"-psychology. But at least under that heading, the academic
community is taking an interest. Utrecht University, in the Netherlands,
and Edinburgh University, in Scotland, have chairs in parapsychology
and, as of 2004, Sweden's Lund University also has a chair for "para
psychology, hypnology, and clairvoyance."
Recognition that there is a bona fide scientific explanation for the
observed nonlocality of consciousness would give legitimacy to research
on psi phenomena and open the way to a better understanding of the
as yet mysterious dimensions of the human mind. Such explanation is
now at hand. The information field that links quanta and galaxies in
the physical universe and cells and organisms in the biosphere also links
the brains and minds of humans in the sociosphere. This A-field creates
the human information pool that Carl Jung called the collective uncon
scious and Teilhard de Chardin the noosphere - and that scientists such
as Erwin Schrodinger, David Bohm, William James, and Henry Stapp
have not hesitated to discuss and to affirm.



SIX
The "A-Field Effect"
Let us take stock. We have a set of puzzles before us, and a variety of
fables that seek to explain them. Even though they are couched in dif
ferent conceptual and theoretical frameworks, the fables point to a
shared fundamental conclusion: things in the real world are not entirely
separate from each other. Not only are they linked by flows of energy;
but they are also linked by flows of information. How does this linking
actually occur? This is the question regarding the effect of the A-field
on the world. It is the question to which we now turn.
THE VARIETIES OF A-FIELD EFFECT
That the A-field informs all things with all other things follows as the
simplest and most meaningful explanation of the nonlocality and
entanglement we have encountered in physics and in cosmology, as well
as in biology and in consciousness research. But in itself this is a
"fable," even if a plausible one, and not (or not yet) a scientific theory.
We also need to explain how the A-field works.
Exploring the working of the A-field is not a simple matter, for the
A-field cannot be perceived. This field is not an imaginary phantasm,
however, for it produces an effect and its effect can be perceived. This
is the rule and not the exception in regard to the other fields postulated
in science. For example, the gravitational field cannot be perceived:
when we drop an object to the ground, we see the object falling but not
the field that makes it fall - we see the effect of the "G-field" but not
106



The "A-Field Effect" 107
the G-field itself. The effect of the G-field is gravitation among separate
masses; the effect of the EM field is electrical/magnetic wave transmis
sion; and the effect of the weak and strong nuclear fields is attraction
or repulsion among masses at extreme proximity to each other. What,
precisely, is the effect of the A-field?
We claim to know what it is that produces the A-field effect: it is
the quantum vacuum. The question is how the A-field of the vacuum
affects the particles and the more complex things that are integrated
ensembles of particles - atoms and molecules, cells and organisms, and
stars and galaxies - that exist in space and time.
The A-field conveys information, and this information, subtle as it
is, has a notable effect: it makes for correlation and creates coherence.
This "in-forming" of everything by everything else is universal, but it is
not universally the same. Universal information does not mean uni
form information. The A-field conveys the most direct, intense, and
therefore evident information between things that are closely similar to
one another (i.e., that are "isomorphic" - have the same basic form).
This is because A-field information is carried by superposed vacuum
wave-interference patterns that are equivalent to holograms. We
know that in a hologram every element meshes with isomorphic ele
ments: with those that are similar to it. Scientists call such meshing
"conjugation" - a holographic pattern is conjugate with similar pat
terns in any assortment of patterns, however vast.
Practical experience bears this out. Using the conjugate pattern as
the "key," we can pick out any single pattern in the complex wave pat
tern of a hologram. We need merely to insert the given wave pattern
into the welter of patterns in the hologram and it attaches to the pat
terns that are conjugate with it. This is similar to the phenomenon of
resonance. Tuning forks and strings on musical instruments resonate
with other forks and strings that are tuned to the same frequency, or to
entire octaves higher or lower than their frequency, but not with forks
and strings tuned to different frequencies. Such a selective response is also
encountered on the Internet. When we input the code of the Web site we
are looking for, the system matches it with the code that corresponds to



108 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
a given site. It unlocks the one door we want among the millions of
doors on the Web.
When we apply the conjugate principle to the interference patterns
in the A-field, we get a simple and logical picture. Through the holograms
created in and conveyed by the A-field, things are directly "in-formed"
by the things that are most like them. For example, an amoeba is
directly informed by other amoebas. This does not mean that things
that are unlike one another would not be mutually informed. They are
so informed, but the informational effect is not equally evident in all
cases. Amoebas are informed by other single-celled organisms, and they
are also informed by far simpler entities such as molecules and by far
more complex ones such as multicellular organisms. But information by
things on other levels is less intense and evident than information by
things that correspond to a thing's own level. The same goes for human
beings. We are directly informed by fellow humans, yet we are also
informed, though less directly, by animals, plants, and all of nature.
Information conveyed through the A-field subtly tunes all things to all
other things and accounts for the coherence we find in the cosmos, as
well as in living nature.
The A-Field Effect in the Cosmos
As we have seen in chapter 5, through torsion waves in the vacuum the
A-field links things and events in the universe at staggering speeds - a
billion times the velocity of light. The interference patterns of torsion
waves create cosmic-scale holograms, the holograms of stars and entire
stellar systems. These extend throughout our universe and correlate its
galaxies and other macrostructures.
The torsion-wave interference patterns of stars and stellar systems
create the hologram of the galaxy, and the interfering vacuum torsion
waves of the metagalaxy (the set of all galaxies) create the hologram of
the universe. The hologram of the universe is conjugate with the holo
gram of the galaxies, and thus this encompassing hologram creates
coherence among the galaxies - it correlates the paths of their evolu
tion. This A-field effect is extremely subtle yet it is effective: stars and



The "A-Field Effect" 109
galaxies evolve coherently throughout the universe, even across dis
tances that could not have been traversed by any light or any signal
known to modern physics.
The "fine-tuning of the universal constants" - why the basic
parameters of the universe are so astonishingly coordinated that com
plex systems such as ourselves can arise in it - is likewise an effect of
the A-field. We know that the Big Bang was incredibly precise in regard
to its parameters, and that the energy density of the vacuum was pre
cisely such that the particles created in that explosion did not fly apart
before they could condense into galaxies and stars and a variety of
potentially life-harboring planets. In a less finely tuned universe we
would not be here to marvel at this precision. With only a minuscule
deviation (such as one part in a billion in the value of a universal force
such as electromagnetism or gravitation, or a tiny excess in energy den
sity), the universe would have been incapable of producing conditions
where living organisms can emerge and evolve.
In the Big Bang theory the fine-tuning of the constants has no con
vincing explanation: mainstream cosmology can only assume that the
pre-space of the universe was random, with chance fluctuations in the
vacuum. However, it is extremely unlikely that chance fluctuations
would have resulted in precisely those fluctuation patterns that could
give rise to a finely tuned universe such as ours.
String theorists do offer an explanation for the fine-tuning of our
universe. Leonard Susskind, for example, suggests that the energy den
sity of the vacuum varies from region to region. There are so many
locally different "vacua" - perhaps of the order of 10500 - that we can
be reasonably certain of finding at least one that has the properties we
are looking for. Since we are here to search for it, we have evidently
found it: it is our particular "local vacuum" - our region of the cosmos.
There is, however, a simpler explanation. The "Bang" that gave
birth to our universe, and the vacuum in which it occurred, was
informed by a prior universe - a previous cycle of the Metaverse.
Whether the universe is infinite or finite in space (and that is still not
clear at present), it is most likely not finite in time: the cosmos is not



110 The Quest for art Integral Theory of Everything
limited to a single-cycle universe. This is relevant to our query, for it is
evident that all universes that exist, and have ever existed, arise in the
quantum vacuum. The particles that make up a given universe spring
from the vacuum and fall back into it at the end of the universe's life
cycle. The vacuum existed before any universe was born, and will con
tinue to exist after all matter in that universe vanishes into black holes.
In the course of a vast series of universes, the vacuum becomes pro
gressively tuned to the processes that take place in the universes that
succeed one another.
The A-field effect gives us a simple and logical explanation of the
fine-tuned features of our own universe. When this universe was born,
the Bang that created it and the vacuum in which that event took place
were not randomly configured. They were informed by prior universes,
much like at conception the genetic code of a zygote is informed by the
genetic code of the parents. That this was the case is far more plausible
than a random selection from among an astronomically large number
of disconnected universes - or among a similarly mind-boggling num
ber of "vacua" in one and the same universe.
The A-Field Effect in the Living World
There is an A-field effect throughout nature - the A-field affects also
organisms. This stands to reason. In the domains of life, the individual
holograms of the molecules and cells of an organism mesh ("conju
gate") with the encompassing hologram of the whole organism. In con
sequence, there is a subtle yet effective correlation among the
organism's molecules, cells, and organs, producing nearly instantaneous
coherence within the organism. This conjugate relationship exists
whether the molecules and cells are next to each other or distant. As we
have seen, experiments show that cells that once belonged to an organ
ism remain connected with that organism even when they are miles
away from it.
Information through the A-field accounts not only for the quasi
instant coherence of all parts of an organism, but also for the subtle but
effective correlation between organisms and environments. The holo



The "A-Field Effect" 111
grams of entire colonies, groups, and communities of organisms are
conjugate with the hologram of the ecology of which they are a part.
The hologram of the ecology in which organisms are embedded corre
lates all organisms in that ecology, down to the structure of their
genome. Thereby, the ongoing variation of the genome is subtly in
formed, increasing the probabilities that when the environment
changes, the genome comes up with mutations that are viable in the
new milieu.
The same principle accounts for the astonishingly rapid evolution
of life in the primeval seas of the young Earth. We have seen that the
oldest rocks date from about four billion years ago, while the earliest
and already highly complex forms of life - blue-green algae and bacte
ria - are over three and a half billion years old. Creating these life-forms
required a coordinated and complex series of reactions, where missing
but a single step would have led to a dead end. A random mixing of the
"molecular soup" in the shallow primeval seas is unlikely to have
accomplished this feat in the available time span. But the mixing of the
molecules on the surface of the primeval Earth was not purely random:
it was informed by the traces of already evolved life! Evidently, these
traces were not those of life on Earth, since we are speaking of the ear
liest beginnings of biological evolution on this planet. They were the
traces of life on other planets.
The "informational seeding" of biological evolution on Earth is
entirely plausible. The zero-point field of the vacuum extends through
out the universe and can carry the torsion-wave interference patterns of
particles and particle systems throughout space. Wherever the vacuum's
holograms penetrate, they bring with them information on the life
forms that evolved in that region of the universe. Since in our galaxy
life is likely to have evolved on other planets prior to its evolution on
Earth, the holographic traces of other biospheres must have been pres
ent in the vacuum at the time the first forms of life appeared on this
planet. These traces must have been sufficiently conjugate with the life
forms that emerged on the young Earth to produce a subtle yet decisive
effect on them. This accelerated the trials and errors of evolution,



112 The Quest for an Integral Theory of Everything
increasing the chances that the turbulent mixing of the molecular soup
would hit on stable, self-maintaining combinations.
Life on Earth was informed by life elsewhere in the universe - just
as Earth life now informs life on other life-bearing planets, wherever
they may exist in this galaxy and beyond.
IN CONCLUSION . . .
Beyond the puzzle-filled world of the mainstream sciences, a new con
cept of the universe is emerging. The established concept is transcended;
in its place comes a new/old concept: the informed universe, rooted in
the rediscovery of ancient tradition's Akashic Field as the vacuum-based
holofield. In this concept the universe is a highly integrated, coherent
system, much like a living organism. Its crucial feature is information
that is generated, conserved, and conveyed by and among all its parts.
This feature is entirely fundamental. It transforms a universe that is
blindly groping its way from one phase of its evolution to the next into
a strongly interconnected system that builds on the information it has
already generated.
A cosmic field that underlies and links all things in the world is a
perennial intuition, present in traditional cosmologies and metaphysics.
The ancients knew that space is not empty: it is the origin and the mem
ory of all things that exist and have ever existed. But this knowledge
was based on philosophical or mystical insight, the fruit of private and
unrepeatable if often seemingly indubitable experience. The current
rediscovery of the Akashic Field reinforces qualitative human experi
ence with quantitative data generated by science's experimental
method. The combination of unique personal insight and interperson
ally observable and repeatable experience gives us the best assurance we
can have that we are on the right track: that a cosmic information field
connects organisms and minds in the biosphere, and particles, stars,
and galaxies throughout the cosmos.
Nature's information field is now being rediscovered at the cutting
edge of the sciences. It emerges as a powerful fable and - as sustained



The "A-Field Effect" 113
research deepens and specifies the theory of the A-field - as a main pil
lar of the scientific world picture of the twenty-first century. This will
profoundly change our concept of ourselves and of the world.
The rediscovery of the A-field will also change our world itself.
When people realize that the age-old intuition that space does not sepa
rate things but links them has a bona fide scientific explanation, the
genius for innovation inherent in modern civilization will find ways to
make practical use of it. As people learn to work with the A-field, untold
ways will come to light for beaming active and effective "in-formation"
from one place to another, instantly and without the expenditure of
energy. This will not only enable quantum computation, but also pave
the way to an entire series of technological breakthroughs. We will learn
to teleport not just bits of quanta but atoms and molecules, living cells
and organs, as well as aspects and elements of consciousness.
The possibilities can hardly be fully grasped today. But we should
not be surprised at being surprised - over and over again.



PART TWO
EXPLORING THE
INFORMED UNIVERSE



116 Exploring the Informed Universe
INTRODUCING THE INFORMED UNIVERSE
The informed universe is a universe where the A-field is a real
and significant element. Thanks to this field, this universe is of
mind-boggling coherence. All that happens in one place happens
also in other places; all that happened at one time happens also
at all times after that. Nothing is "local," limited to where and
when it is happening. All things are global, indeed cosmic, for
the memory of all things extends to all places and all times. This
is the concept of the informed universe, the view of the world
that will hallmark science and society in the coming decades.
The informed universe is not a universe of separate things
and events, of external spectators and an impersonal spectacle.
Unlike the world of the mainstream sciences, it is not even mate
rialistic. Matter - the kind of "stuff" that is made up of particles
joined in nuclei joined in atoms joined in molecules that may
also be joined in cells joined in tissues joined in organisms joined
in ecologies - is not a distinct reality. It is energy bound in quan
tized wave-packets. The classical idea, that all there is in the
world is matter, and that all matter was created in the Big Bang
and will disappear either in black holes or in a Big Crunch, was
a colossal mistake. And the belief that when we know how mat
ter behaves we know everything - a belief shared by classical
physics and Marxist ideology - was a colossal pretense. Such
views have been definitively superseded. There are more things
in this universe than classical scientists, engineers, and Marxists
have ever thought of! And many of the things that are in this
world are more amazing than writers of science fiction could
ever imagine.
But the truly remarkable feature of the informed universe is
not that matter is not its fundamental feature. What is remark
able is that everything that happens in it affects - "informs"
everything else. This is not as strange as it might seem: we have



Exploring the Informed Universe 117
noted in chapter 4 that even in the sea around us every thing
affects every other thing. An even more familiar example is the
aquarium many of us had as children. Christopher Laszlo, the
author's son, had such a fish tank in his teens and he maintains
that understanding what happens in it is a good way to under
stand what happens in the universe at large.
THE FISH TANK AND THE INFORMED UNIVERSE: A SUGGESTIVE METAPHOR
Contributed by Christopher Laszlo *
Imagine you are standing in front of a huge panoramic-view
aquarium. Angelfish and dwarf cichlids hover delicately while
giant gourami and red-striped tiger barbs chase a few lazy scav
enger fish on the pebbled floor. Silver neons flash among the
African water ferns and Amazon sword plants. Small bubbles of
air rise to the drone of an electric filter.
Suddenly two motorized toy submarines are introduced from
the water's surface and sink halfway down. The fish streak
around the aquarium walls a few times and then settle down as
the apparent danger vanishes.
Now look closely at the motion of the submarines. They
weave and bob with the movement of the fish, even with the
rising bubbles of air. When the submarines are switched on,
they glide through the water, creating little underwater wakes
that draw in the fish and cause the plants to sway. At times a
submarine pulls a fish into its wake, and the fish, in reacting to
this movement, struggles to get away and creates turbulence
that causes the submarine to veer precipitously on its side.

118 Exploring the Informed Universe
Every motion has an impact on everything else in the tank.
Every fish, plant, submarine, pebble, and bubble is connected by
motion through the water in the form of waves. Although you
cannot see it, the intersecting waves carry information about the
things that created them. The wake of the submarine propeller
codes a different set of data than the ripples of a dorsal fin. As
the two waves collide, the submarine and the fish mutually
influence each other, conveying each other's location, speed,
and size.
You are looking at a simple model of the universe according
to the theory of the A-field. In this theory the underlying physi
cal reality is a holographic field in which every thing - be it a
particle, an atom, a molecule, an amoeba, a mouse, or a human
being - is connected with every other thing. And every thing
affects every other thing through wave pressures that literally
shape the things around them.
There are a few important differences between the fish tank
model and the A-field-informed universe. In the fish tank, the
waves contain information as well as a physical force - you can
feel the impact of a wave under water. In the A-field, the waves
carry information without carrying force, meaning that you
can't feel them. In the fish tank, the waves eventually slow down
and disappear. In the A-field, the waves never attenuate because
they are moving through a frictionless medium, with nothing to
slow their progress. These first two differences between the fish
tank and the universe arise because the A-field is a medium that,
like the supercooled helium used in superconductivity experi
ments, cannot be registered by conventional means. You can't
see or feel waves in the A-field. Energy moves through super
conductive material without ever slowing down or diminishing,
unlike electric impulses moving through copper - which is why
phone lines need repeaters to carry signals over long distances.
In the medium of the A-field, things move effortlessly without

encountering any observable resistance. For this reason, leading
scientists in the past concluded that space is merely a void. Sir
Isaac Newton himself believed that the vacuum of space is a pas
sive receptacle through which physical objects move, obeying
the laws of motion he discovered.
But wait - the informed universe becomes ever more strange.
In the fish tank, waves travel at relatively earthbound speeds of
up to a few hundred miles an hour over tiny distances. In the
A-field, waves can travel faster than the speed of light - faster
than 186,000 miles per second! This very high speed of infor
mation transmission accounts for events that appear to be syn
chronized over great distances - a kind of instant correlation,
known as nonlocality, that scientists are discovering in a num
ber of disciplines. Think how instantly every molecule in your
body adjusts to the thousands of biochemical reactions pro
duced every second, or how a thought that suddenly entered
your mind also entered your loved one's mind at precisely the
same moment, even though he or she was hundreds of miles
away at the time.
In the fish tank, "what you see is what you get": a tiger barb
is the same color and shape every time you look at it. In the
informed universe, each of the tiniest building blocks of physi
cal reality (known by strange names such as quarks, gluons, and
bosons) exists as a potential of many different states. Their
potentiality is said to collapse into an actual state when
observed or otherwise interacted with. It's as if a tiger barb fish
"potential" existed that, when observed, became one of several
possible actual tiger barbs - sometimes silver and thin, some
times striped and fat, other times transparent.
The A-field ties together all physical systems in a highly
coherent whole. This means that pure chance, the roll of the die,
plays no fundamental role in evolution, unlike Darwin's theory
of random mutations that lead to the survival of the fittest. The



120 Exploring the Informed Universe
A-field continuously interacts with matter at every level from
subatomic to cosmic to influence the way every living thing
grows, adapts, and evolves. This makes for a highly coherent
world in which things at one level (such as atoms) are influenced
by things at another level (such as human beings), which in turn
are influenced by still other levels all the way up to the universe
itself - and even prior universes, helping to account for the
finely tuned coherence of our own universe as we know it.
In this perspective the cosmos is intrinsically creative, pre
serving and renewing the imprint of all that exists. The A-field
is a kind of active memory field encompassing space (it is every
where) and time (it endures). It is as if all the fish and plants in
the fish tank were physical manifestations of the water, inter
connected by the water in such a way that whatever happens to
one influences what happens to all others in a mutually depend
ent system, evolving together in a delicate dance of all life and
all of nature.

The Origins and Destiny of Life
and the Universe
WHERE EVERYTHING CAME FROM AND WHERE IT IS GOING
In the chapters that follow we ask questions that concern the nature
and future of the universe and the principal kind of things in it. Where
did everything come from - and where is it going? Is there life elsewhere
in this galaxy and beyond? And if there is, will it evolve to higher stages
or dimensions?
We also ask about the nature of consciousness. Did it originate with
Homo sapiens, or is it part of the fundamental fabric of the cosmos?
Will it evolve further in the course of time - and what kind of impact
will it have on us and on our children when it does?
Then we probe still deeper. Does consciousness cease at the physi
cal death of the body or does it continue to exist in some way, in this
or in another sphere of reality? And, last but not least, could the uni
verse itself possess some form of consciousness, a cosmic or divine root
from which our consciousness has grown, and with which it remains
subtly connected?
We begin with perhaps the greatest of the "great questions." Where
did the universe come from?
People have never ceased to wonder about the origins and the des
tiny of the world. The earliest answers were couched in the mystical
worldview, followed by the worldviews of the great religions. In regard
121



122 Exploring the Informed Universe
to concepts of origin and destiny, the classical views of East and West
were remarkably consistent: they both envisaged the origins of the uni
verse as a stupendous process of self-creation. But with the rise of
monotheistic religion in the West, the creation story of the Old
Testament replaced mystical and metaphysical accounts. Throughout
the Middle Ages, Christians, Muslims, and Jews believed that an all
powerful God created the sky above and the Earth below, and all things
in between, with purpose and intent, just the way we find them.
In the nineteenth century, the Judeo-Christian account of creation
came into conflict with the theories of modern science, in particular
with Darwinian biology. A vivid contrast arose between the view that
everything we behold was created intentionally by a divine power and
the concept according to which living species evolve on their own, from
simpler common origins. The contrast fueled endless debates, surviving
to this day in the controversy surrounding the teaching of "creationist"
vs. "evolutionist" theories in public schools.
Since the 1930s, the Judeo-Christian creation story has had to con
tend not only with the Darwinian doctrine of biological evolution, but
also with physical cosmology. Newton's clockwork universe required a
Prime Mover to wind it up and get it going, and this could be attributed
to the work of a Creator. Subsequently Einstein's steady-state universe
could do without a Creator, for it persisted from the beginnings of time
the same as it is today. But when the steady-state universe was replaced
by the Big Bang theory's explosively expanding universe, questions
arose again about the world's origins. If the universe was born in a Big
Bang 13.7 billion years ago and will end either in the Big Crunch some
two thousand billion years in the future or in the evaporation of the last
galactic-cluster-sized black holes at the almost inconceivable time hori
zon of 10122 years, the question that comes to mind is: What was there
before all this began - and what will be there after it is over?
The best the "BB theory" can say about how the universe came into
being is that a random instability took place in a fluctuating cosmic vac
uum, the pre-space of the universe. It cannot say either why this insta
bility occurred or why it occurred when it occurred. And otherwise



The Origins and Destiny of Life and the Universe 123
than through implausibly speculative fables - such as a cosmic roulette
among a large number of randomly created universes - it also cannot
say why the universe came to be the way it came to be: why it has the
remarkable properties it now exhibits. The question returns, it seems,
to the domain of religion and mysticism. But giving up on science
would be premature. The Big Bang theory is not the final word; the new
cosmologies have more to say about cosmic origins.
As we have seen, there are sophisticated cosmologies that tell us
that our universe is not the only universe. There is also a meta-universe
or Metaverse that was not created in the Bang that created our universe
(which was but one of many explosions, so it no longer qualifies for the
adjective "Big"); nor will the Metaverse itself come to an end when all
the matter created by this particular Bang vanishes in the collapse of the
last black holes. The insight that dawns is that the universe existed prior
to the birth of our universe, and it will continue to exist after our uni
verse's demise. The universe is the Metaverse, the mother of our universe
and perhaps of myriad other universes.
Cosmologies of the Metaverse are in a better position than the Big
Bang theory (which is limited to our universe) to speak of conditions
that reigned before, and will reign after, the life cycle of our universe.
The quantum vacuum, the subtle energy and information sea that
underlies all matter in the universe, did not originate with the Bang that
produced our universe, and it will not vanish when matter created by
that explosion dies back. The subtle energies and information that
underlie this universe were there before its particles of matter appeared
and will be there after these particles disappear. Thus, the deeper real
ity is the quantum vacuum, the enduring virtual-energy sea that pul
sates, producing periodic explosions that give rise to local universes.
Universe-creating explosions (recurring "Bangs") are instabilities in the
Metaverse's vacuum. The Bangs create pairs of particles and antiparti
cles, and the surviving surplus of particles populates the newborn uni
verse's space-time. In time, gravitation pulls together these particles in
galactic structures, and the kind of evolution we observe in our universe
gets under way. It unfolds time after time.



124 Exploring the Informed Universe
The evolution of universes leads ultimately to quasars and black
holes. Galaxies collapse on themselves as black holes form at their center,
such as the black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy that was
discovered recently. Sooner or later all galaxies "evaporate" in super
galactic black holes. These lead to further explosions - "star-bursts" of
this kind have been observed - and these may prove to be the Bangs of
subsequent universes.
Notwithstanding technical disagreements among different cosmolog
ical scenarios, most cosmologists agree that we live in a multiverse rather
than a universe. Local universes evolve, die back, and coexist with, or are
succeeded by, other universes in the embrace of a vast, temporally (if not
necessarily spatially) infinite Metaverse. If these universes had no causal
contact with one another, each of them would start with an accidental
configuration of its basic laws and constants, and such a configuration,
we have seen, has negligible chances of giving rise to complex systems
such as living organisms. If we were to assume that at its birth our uni
verse was not in causal contact with precursor universes, we would not
be able to find natural causes for its astonishing propensity to bring forth
life. Scientists could only marvel at the incredible serendipity that life
could arise and evolve on Earth, and possibly elsewhere in this universe.
Instead of marveling at this improbable scenario, we can now explore
the possibility that at its birth our universe was informed by a precursor
universe. According to this cosmological conception, all universes leave
their traces in the vacuum that embeds them, much as ships leave their
traces in the sea on which they sail. These holographic traces do not can
cel out as new universes are born; they superpose and accumulate. In con
sequence, there is an ongoing transfer of information between local
universes: the "Bangs" of later universes are informed by the traces of
their precursors. As the parameters of later universes become tuned to the
processes that unfolded in the earlier universes, later universes neither col
lapse back on themselves shortly after their birth nor expand so fast that
only a dilute gas of particles survives. They evolve more and more effi
ciently, and hence further and further than their predecessors.
As we have seen, our universe has laws and constants that are highly



The Origins and Destiny of Life and the Universe 125
tuned to the evolution of life, indicating that when it was born, the pri
mordial fluctuations of the vacuum are unlikely to have been random.
They were precise, and this suggests that they were not accidental. So the
logical conclusion regarding the origins of our universe is that the vac
uum in which it arose was modulated by the traces of a prior universe.
What about the origins of the universe that preceded ours, and of all
universes before that? How did the Metaverse itself come into being?
In considering this question, we should start with an important fact
about complex systems: the fact that they are highly "initial-condition
dependent." This means that their development is strongly influenced
by the circumstances under which that development has been initiated.
Our universe is a complex system; in fact, as far as we can tell, it is the
most complex system there is. Its development must have been critically
influenced by the conditions under which it was initiated - that is, by
the fluctuating vacuum pre-space that exploded and created our uni
verse's micro- and macro-structures, its particles and its galaxies.
We now apply the concept of initial-condition dependence to the
Metaverse itself. The Metaverse's development also must have been
critically influenced by its initial conditions. But prior universes could
not have set these conditions, for the Metaverse was there before all
universes. How, then, were the initial conditions of the Metaverse
determined - By what... or is the question By whom? This is the deep
est and greatest mystery of all - the mystery of the origins of the universe
generating process itself.
This greatest of all mysteries is "transempirical"; it is not amenable
to resolution by reasoning based on observation and experiment. Yet
one thing is clear: If it is unlikely that our fine-tuned universe would
have originated in a series of random fluctuations, the mother universe
that gave rise to a series of progressively evolving local universes is even
more unlikely to have originated in that way. The Metaverse's pre-space
was not only such that one universe could arise in it, but also such that
an entire series of universes could. This could hardly have been a lucky
fluke. We must admit that there must have been an original creative act,
an act of "metaversal Design."



126 Exploring the Informed Universe
DESIGN OR EVOLUTION?
THE CREATIONIST CONTROVERSY IN A NEW LIGHT
The persistent debate among conservative Christians, Muslims,
and Jews (the "creationists") and scientists and the science
minded public (the "evolutionists") centers on biological evolu
tion. But on a deeper look, it concerns the universe itself in
which life evolved - or in which it was created.
At first glance, the science community - and anyone believing
that science discloses some basic truth about the nature of
reality - is compelled to reject the hypothesis that living species
are the way they are because they were designed to be that way
. . . that they are the result of special acts of creation. Yet it is
also evident that it is highly unlikely that living species could
have come about through processes of random mutation and
natural selection. Affirming this theory, the creationists claim,
makes the entire doctrine of evolution misguided.
. Mainline Darwinists expose themselves to the objection of the
creationists by contending that random processes of evolution
are adequate to explain the facts. Richard Dawkins, for example,
claims that the living world is the result of processes of piecemeal
trial and error without deeper meaning and significance. Like
Weinberg, Dawkins claims that there is no purpose and meaning
to this world. Therefore, there is no need to assume that it was
purposefully designed.
Take cheetahs, he said. They give every indication of being
superbly designed to kill antelopes. The teeth, claws, eyes, nose,
leg muscles, backbone, and brain of a cheetah are all precisely
what we should expect if God's purpose in creating cheetahs
was to maximize deaths among antelopes. At the same time,
antelopes are fast, agile, and watchful, apparently designed so
they can escape cheetahs. Yet neither the one nor the other fea



The Origins and Destiny of Life and the Universe 127
ture implies creation by special design: Dawkins tells us that this
is just the way nature is. Cheetahs have a "utility function" to
kill antelopes, and antelopes, to escape cheetahs. Nature itself is
indifferent to their fate. Ours is a world of blind physical forces
and genetic replication where some get hurt and others flourish.
It has precisely the properties we would expect it to have if at
bottom there was no design, no purpose, and no evil and no
good, only blind and pitiless indifference.
Evidently, if this were the case, it would be hard to believe in
an intelligent Creator. The God that created the world would
have to be an indifferent God, if not actually a sadist who enjoys
blood sports. It is more reasonable, according to Dawkins, to
hold that the world just is, without reason and purpose. The
way it is results from random processes played out within limits
set by fundamental physical laws. The idea of design is super
fluous. In this regard, Darwinists echo the French mathemati
cian Pierre Laplace, who is reputed to have told Napoleon that
God is a hypothesis for which there is no longer any need.
Creationists point out, however, that it is entirely improbable
that all we see in this world, ourselves included, should be the
result of random processes governed by impersonal laws. The
tenet that everything evolved by blind chance out of common
and simple origins is mere theory, they say, unsubstantiated by
solid evidence. Scientists cannot come up with manifest proof
for this theory of evolution: "You can't go into the laboratory
or the field and make the first fish," said Tom Willis, director of
the Creation Science Association for Mid-America. The world
around us is far more than a chance concatenation of disjoined
elements; it exhibits meaning and purpose. This implies design.
The creationist position would be the logical choice if cutting
edge evolutionary theory asserted that the origin of living
species was truly the product of blind chance. But it does not.
As we have seen, post-Darwinian biology has discovered that



128 Exploring the Informed Universe
biological evolution is not merely the outcome of chance muta
tions exposed to natural selection. The coevolution of all things
with all other things in the planet's web of life is a systemic
process with a built-in dynamic. It is part of the evolution of the
universe from particles to galaxies and stars with planets. On
Earth this evolution produced physical, chemical, and thermal
conditions that were just right for the stupendous processes of
biological evolution to take off. Such conditions could have
come about only in a universe governed by precisely coordi
nated laws and regularities. Even a minute difference in these
laws and constants would have foreclosed the emergence of life
forever.
Thus, the debate between creationists and evolutionists shifts
from the question regarding the origins of life to the question
concerning the origins of the universe. In the last analysis, it
shifts to the origins of the Metaverse in which our universe
arose. Could it be that the Metaverse, the mother of our uni
verse and of all universes past, present, and future, has been pur
posefully designed so that it could produce universes that give
rise to life? For creationists, this is the simplest and most logical
assumption. Evolutionists cannot object: evolution, being an
irreversible process, must have had a beginning, and that begin
ning must be accounted for. It could not have been something
out of nothing - a "free lunch"!
In the final count, the evolutionist/creationist controversy has
no point. The question "Design or evolution?" poses a false
alternative. Design and evolution do not exclude each other;
indeed, they require one another. The Metaverse is unlikely to
have come into existence out of nothing, as a result of pure
chance. And if it was designed, it was evidently so designed that
it could evolve. The truth of the matter is not "design or evolu
tion." It is "design for evolution."



The Origins and Destiny of Life and the Universe 129
Where is the universe going? We now reverse the direction of our
inquiry. Instead of moving back in time, we move forward. In a coher
ently evolving universe this, too, is possible. The question we ask is:
Where is the evolution of this universe, and of all universes in the
Metaverse, leading - to what ultimate state or condition?
In contemplating this question we must realize that we are query
ing destiny and not fate. There is a fundamental difference between a
point of origin and a point of destiny. A point of origin is in the past,
and must be assumed to have been a definite and unique state. A point
of destiny will be likewise a definite and unique state when it is
reached - but it will not be that until it is reached. Much like the multi
potentiality of the quantum that is free to choose its state until an inter
action collapses its wave function, the cosmos will not have a
determinate final state until it actually reaches that state. Not being
classically mechanistic, it is undetermined as regards the choice of its
ultimate state. The cosmos has various possibilities for its evolution.
The past is a stubborn fact, established once and for all, but the
future is not. It is open, even if it is not entirely open. Ours is, after all,
not a random, haphazard world, but one that evolves according to
coherent laws and constants. This evolution is both self-consistent
and irreversible. Its processes drive toward a definite kind of terminal
state, but they do not predetermine one unique state as the only pos
sible outcome.
Processes that head toward a final state that was not determined in
the beginning are known to systems theorists: they are processes gov
erned by so-called strange or chaotic attractors. These attractors intro
duce an element of indeterminacy into the systems. Computer
simulations show that processes governed by such attractors reach an
end state that is likely to be different in detail every time the simulation
is run.



130 Exploring the Informed Universe
A GAME THAT GENERATES ITS OWN GOAL
There is a simpler way than computer simulation to experience
processes that lead to goal states that were not given at the
beginning. It can be done by playing the particular variant of the
popular parlor game twenty questions that was suggested by the
physicist John Wheeler (though he had an abstruse problem of
quantum physics in mind). In the usual version of this game, a
person leaves the room and the others decide on a thing or
object that the person is to guess. The latter can ask a maximum
of twenty questions, and only "yes" or "no" answers can be
given to each question. But each question narrows the scope of
possibilities because it excludes alternative possibilities. For
example, if the first question is "Is it living?" (as opposed to
nonliving), a yes answer excludes all things other than plants,
animals, insects, and simple organisms.
In the alternative version, a person leaves the room and the
others, without telling him, agree not to agree on a given thing
or object but pretend that they did. They must give consistent
answers, however. Consequently, when the innocent interlocu
tor returns and asks, "Is it living?" and if the answer he or she
gets is yes, then all subsequent answers must pretend that the
thing to be guessed is a plant, an animal, or perhaps a microor
ganism. A skilled player can narrow the scope of possibilities in
such a way that within twenty questions he or she identifies one
definite answer - for example, the kitten next door. Yet that was
not the goal when the game was started. There was no goal
the one that emerged was generated by the game itself!
Our universe evolves with a great deal of coherence and consis
tency; one thing entails another. When one choice is made, the cascade
of consequences continues until the final state is reached. The choices



The Origins and Destiny of Life and the Universe 131
themselves are not random; they are constrained by the laws and con
stants of the universe system. The evolution of the universe has no fixed
goal, but it does have a definite direction: toward growing structure and
complexity. The evolutionary process adds part to part in coherent and
self-consistent wholes. These in turn become part of still other, more
encompassing self-consistent wholes.
Being so fine-tuned for the evolution of complexity, our universe
could not have been the first universe to arise in the Metaverse. And if
it was not the first universe, it is also not likely to be the last. Other uni
verses will come about in time. What universes? We can also shed light
on this far-reaching - but no longer "far-out" - query.
The evolution of the Metaverse is cyclic but not repetitive. One uni
verse informs another; there is progress from universe to universe. Thus,
each universe is more evolved than the one before. The mother universe
itself evolves from a random initial universe, to universes where the physi
cal parameters are more and more tuned to the evolution of complexity.
Cosmic evolution is toward universes where complex structures emerge,
including structures that harbor evolved forms of life - and the evolved
forms of mind that are presumably associated with all evolved forms of life.
The Metaverse evolves from local universes that are purely physical
to universes that include life. These are physical-biological universes.
And given that forms of mind are associated with forms of life, the cycle
of universes leads from physical to physical-biological to physical
biological-psychological worlds.
Is reaching a physical-biological-psychological universe the deeper
meaning of the evolution, and perhaps the very existence, of the
Metaverse? Possibly, and perhaps even probably. But we cannot be cer
tain. A definitive answer is foreclosed to science, and to any reasoning
this side of mystical intuition and prophetic insight.
LIFE ON EARTH AND IN THE UNIVERSE
Is there life elsewhere in the universe? We move now to the next set of
"great questions": questions that are still "great" but somewhat more



132 Exploring the Informed Universe
modest. They are questions about the origins and destiny of life on
Earth and in the cosmos. The first query concerns the prevalence of life.
7s life unique to this planet or does it exist throughout the universe?
We have every reason to believe that the kind of life we know on
Earth is not limited to this planet. Life arose here over four billion years
ago, and since then it has been evolving inexorably, if highly discontin
uously, building structure upon structure, system within and with sys
tem. We have no reason to doubt that wherever suitable conditions are
present, processes of physical, physical-chemical, and ultimately bio
logical and ecological self-organization are getting under way. And we
have every reason to believe that suitable conditions have been and are
present in many places. Astronomical spectral analysis reveals a
remarkable uniformity in the composition of matter in stars and hence
in the planets that are associated with stars. The most abundant ele
ments are, in order of rank: hydrogen, helium, oxygen, nitrogen, and
carbon. Of these, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon are funda
mental constituents of life. Where these occur in the right distribution
and energy is available to start chains of reaction, complex compounds
result. On many planets the active star with which the planet is associ
ated furnishes such energy. The energy is in the form of ultraviolet light,
together with electric discharges, ionizing radiation, and heat.
About four billion years ago, photochemical reactions took place in
the upper regions of the young Earth's atmosphere, and the reaction
products were transferred by convection to the surface of the planet.
Electric discharges close to the surface deposited the products in the
primeval oceans, where volcanic hot springs supplied further energy.
The combination of energy from the Sun with energy stored below the
surface catalyzed a series of reactions of which the end products were
organic compounds. The same system-building process is no doubt able
to unfold with local variations on other planets. Numerous experiments
pioneered by the paleobiologist Cyril Ponnamperuma and others show
that when conditions similar to those that were present on the primeval
Earth are simulated in the laboratory, the very compounds emerge that
form the basis of Earthly life.



The Origins and Destiny of Life and the Universe 133
There must be other planets with conditions similar to those on
Earth. There are more than 1020 stars in our universe, and during their
active phase they all generate energy. When these energies reach the
planets associated with the stars, they are capable of fueling the photo
chemical reactions required for life. Of course, not all stars are in the
active phase, and not all have planets with the right chemical composi
tion, of the right size, and at the right distance.
Just how many potentially life-bearing planets are there? The esti
mates vary. Taking a conservative tack, the Harvard astronomer
Harlow Shapley assumed that only one star in a thousand has planets
and that only one of a thousand of these stars has a planet at the right
distance from it (in our solar system, there are two such planets). He
further supposed that only one out of a thousand planets at the right
distance is large enough to hold an atmosphere (in our system, seven
planets are large enough), and that only one in a thousand planets at
the right distance and of the right size has the right chemical composi
tion to support life. Even then there should be at least 100 million plan
ets capable of supporting life in the cosmos.
The astronomer Su-Shu Huang made less limiting assumptions and
reached an even more optimistic estimate. He took the time scales of
stellar and biological evolution, the habitable zones of planets and
related dynamic factors, and came to the conclusion that no less than
five percent of all solar systems in the universe should be able to sup
port life. This means not 100 million, but 100 billion life-bearing plan
ets. Harrison Brown came up with a bigger number still. He investigated
the possibility that many planetlike objects that are not visible exist in
the neighborhood of visible stars - perhaps as many as sixty such
objects more massive than Mars. In that case, almost every visible star
possesses a partially or wholly invisible planetary system. Brown esti
mated that there are at least 100 billion planetary systems in our own
galaxy alone - and there are 100 billion galaxies in this universe. If he
is right, life in the cosmos is immensely more prevalent than has been
previously estimated.
This optimistic estimate has been underscored by a finding of the



134 Exploring the Informed Universe
Hubble Space Telescope in December of 2003. The Space Telescope
succeeded in measuring a highly controversial object in an ancient part
of our galaxy. It was not known whether this object is a planet or a
brown dwarf. It has turned out to be a planet, having two and a half
times the mass of Jupiter. It has an estimated age of thirteen billion
years, which means that it must have formed barely a billion years after
the birth of our universe!
Planets keep forming with remarkable speed and abundance to this
day. In May of 2004, astronomers trained the new Spitzer Space
Telescope at a "star nursery" region of the universe known as RCW 49,
and in one image uncovered three hundred newborn stars, some not
more than one million years old. A closer look at two of the stars
showed that they have faint planet-forming disks of dust and gas
around them. The astronomers estimated that all 300 might harbor
such disks. This is a surprising discovery. If planets form around many
stars, and if they form so soon, they must be far more abundant than
was previously estimated.
If life potentially exists in so many places in the universe, wouldn't
intelligent life and even technological civilization also exist? The prob
abilities in this regard were first calculated by Frank Drake in 1960.
The famous Drake equation gives the statistical probabilities of the
existence in our galaxy of stars with planets; of planets with environ
ments capable of sustaining life; of life on some of the life-friendly plan
ets; of intelligent life on some of the actually life-bearing planets; and of
advanced technological civilization produced by the intelligent life that
evolved on these planets. Drake found that, given the large number of
stars in our galaxy, as many as ten thousand advanced technological
civilizations are likely to exist in the Milky Way galaxy alone.
The Drake equation was updated and elaborated by Carl Sagan and
colleagues in 1979. Their computations claim that not ten thousand,
but up to one million intelligent civilizations could exist in our galaxy.
In the late 1990s, Robert Taormina applied these equations to a region
within one hundred light-years from Earth and found that more than
eight such civilizations should be present within "hailing distance"



The Origins and Destiny of Life and the Universe 135
from us. And in light of the fact that planets started to form a billion
years or so after the birth of the universe, these estimates must be
revised upward once again.
Should we be hearing from an advanced extraterrestrial civilization
before long? The chances of interplanetary communication are real. In
the last fifteen years, twelve hundred Sun-like stars in our vicinity have
been scrutinized by astronomers with ground-based telescopes, and
their search has come up with ninety extrasolar planets. A particularly
promising find was announced in June 2002: the planetary system
known as 55 Cancri. It is within hailing distance: forty-one light-years
from us. It appears to have a planet that resembles Jupiter in mass and
in regard to orbit. Calculations indicate that 55 Cancri could also have
rocky planets much like Mars, Venus, and Earth.
However, this is a relatively exceptional find. Most of the other
solar systems in our neighborhood have alien planets in widely eccen
tric orbits, moving either too far from their host sun to sustain life or
moving too close to it.
Even though planets appear to be highly abundant in this galaxy
and elsewhere in the cosmos, planets capable of sustaining advanced
forms of life could be relatively rare. According to Peter Ward and
Donald Brownlee, radiation and heat levels are so high on most plan
ets that the only forms of life that are likely to exist are a variety of bac
teria deep in the soil. The odds against advanced technological
civilization beyond Earth, they say, are astronomical. But even if plan
ets with the right composition, the right distance from the host star, and
the right orbit were rare in the universe, the existence of advanced civ
ilizations could not be excluded. There are an astronomical number of
stars and planets, so even if the odds are astronomically against such
civilizations, they do not foreclose their actual existence, but only indi
cate that they would be less frequent.
Although the evolution of cellular and then multicellular organisms
on suitable planets may take millions if not billions of years, life has
most probably evolved to higher forms on some other planets, even if not
on very many others. Under particularly favorable conditions, evolution



136 Exploring the Informed Universe
is likely to lead to advanced organisms with an evolved brain and nerv
ous system. And these organisms are likely to have an evolved con
sciousness capable of establishing advanced civilizations. This means
that even if they are relatively rare, extraterrestrial civilizations are
likely to exist, created by complex organisms on life-bearing planets.
In the informed universe, the existence of life, and also of advanced
civilizations, is far more probable than in a noninformed universe.
Through the A-field, life in any one place informs and facilitates the
evolution of life in other places, so the evolution of life never starts
from scratch. It is not at the mercy of lucky flukes of random mutations
coming up with organisms that prove viable in changing environments.
The evolution of life on Earth did not rely on chance mutations, nor
did it require the physical importation of organisms or proto-organisms
from elsewhere in the solar system, as the "biological seeding" theories
of the origins of life suggest. Instead, the chemical soup out of which
the first proto-organisms arose was informed by the A-field-conveyed
traces of extraterrestrial life. Life on Earth was not biologically, but
rather informationally seeded.
A-field-conveyed interplanetary information is a subtle prompt that
speeds up the evolution of complex systems. It favors the rise of
advanced life-forms under suitable thermal and chemical conditions.
Such information increases the chances that organisms evolve that are
capable of creating a form of civilization.
Can the human brain pick up interplanetary information? Very
likely it can, even though our everyday logic suppresses it for being
strange, without evident sensory origin. Traces of it can emerge
nonetheless in altered states of consciousness, where the censorship that
filters incoming information is temporarily lifted.
At this crucial juncture in the evolution of human civilization, it
would be of particular importance to open our minds to interplanetary
information. Numerous civilizations are likely to exist in this galaxy,
and in the 100 billion other galaxies of our universe. These civilizations
must also have faced at some point the challenge of finding a way to live
on their home planet without allowing their technologies to damage the



The Origins and Destiny of Life and the Universe 137
natural cycles that make up their biosphere. If they survived, they met this challenge. But how did they achieve a condition of sustainability? The answer must be in the A-field. Getting an inkling of it may make the crucial difference between bumbling along in a fateful gamble with trial and error and moving with intuitive assurance toward solutions that have been already tried and tested - even if not here, but elsewhere in the universe.
THE FUTURE OF LIFE IN THE COSMOS
The reasonable certainty that life, even advanced forms of life, exists not just on Earth does not tell us that life will exist forever, whether on this or on other planets. The fact is that life cannot exist indefinitely in the cosmos: the physical resources required for carbon-based life - the only kind we know of - do not last forever.
The evolution of the known forms of life depends on a strictly limited range of temperatures and the presence of a specific variety of chemical compounds. These factors, as we have seen, are likely to exist on a number of planets in this and other galaxies, on planets that have the right chemical and thermal conditions, situated at the right distance from their active star. But whether such planets are highly abundant or relatively rare, the conditions they provide for the sustenance of life are limited in time. The principal reason is that the active phase of the stars whose radiation drives the processes of life does not last forever. Sooner or later stars exhaust their nuclear fuel, and then they either shrink to the white dwarf stage or fly apart in a supernova explosion. The population of active stars is not infinitely replenished in this universe. Even if new stars keep forming from interstellar dust, a time must come when no further stars are born.
Even if the time spans are mind-boggling, the limitations are real. About 1012 (one trillion) years from now, all the stars that remain in our universe will first have converted their hydrogen into helium - the main fuel of the supercompacted but still luminous white dwarf state - and then will have exhausted their supply of helium. We have already been



138 Exploring the Informed Universe
able to observe that the galaxies constituted of such stars take on a reddish tint, then - when their stars cool still further - fade from sight altogether. As energy is lost in the galaxies through gravitational radiation, individual stars move closer together. The chance of collision among them increases, and the collisions that occur precipitate some stars toward the center of their galaxies and expel others into extragalactic space. As a result, the galaxies diminish in size. Galactic clusters also shrink, and in time both galaxies and galactic clusters implode into black holes. At the time horizon of 1034 years, all matter in our universe will be reduced to radiation, positronium (pairs of positrons and electrons), and compacted nuclei in black holes.
Black holes themselves decay and disappear in a process Stephen Hawking calls evaporation. A black hole resulting from the collapse of a galaxy evaporates in 10" years, while a giant black hole containing the mass of a galactic supercluster vanishes in 10117 years. (If protons do not decay, this span of time expands to 10122 years.) Beyond this humanly inconceivable time horizon, the cosmos contains matter particles only in the form of positronium, neutrinos, and gamma-ray photons.
Whether the universe is expanding (open), expanding and then contracting (closed), or balanced in a steady state, the complex structures required for the known forms of life vanish before matter itself supercrunches, or evaporates.
In the late phases of a closed universe - one that ultimately collapses back on itself - the universe's background radiation increases gradually but inexorably, subjecting living organisms to mounting temperatures. The wavelength of radiation contracts from the microwave region into the region of radio waves, and then into the infrared spectrum. When it reaches the visible spectrum, space is lit with an intense light. At that time all life-bearing planets are vaporized, along with every other object in the vicinity.
In an open universe that expands indefinitely, life dies out because of cold rather than heat. As galaxies continue to move outward, many active stars complete their natural life cycle before gravitational forces bunch them close enough to create a serious risk of collision. But this



The Origins and Destiny of Life and the Universe 139
does not improve the prospects of life. Sooner or later all the active
stars of the universe exhaust their nuclear fuel and then their energy
output diminishes. The dying stars either expand to the red giant stage,
swallowing up their inner planets, or settle into lower luminosity levels
on the way to becoming white dwarfs or neutron stars. At these dimin
ished energy levels, they are too cold to sustain whatever organic life
may have evolved on their planets.
A similar scenario holds in a steady-state universe. As active stars
approach the end of their life cycle, their energy output falls below the
threshold where life can be supported. Ultimately a lukewarm, evenly
distributed radiation fills space, in a universe where the remnants of
matter are random occurrences. This universe is incapable of maintain
ing the flame of a candle, not to mention the complex irreversible reac
tions that are the basis of life.
Whether our universe expands and then contracts, expands infi
nitely, or reaches a steady state, the later stages of its evolution will
wipe out the known forms of life.
This is a dismal picture, but it is not the whole picture. The whole
picture is not limited to our own finite universe; there is also a tempo
rally (whether or not also spatially) infinite or quasi-infinite Metaverse.
And life in the Metaverse need not end with the devolution of local uni
verses. While life in each local universe must end, it can evolve again in
the universes that follow.
If evolution in each local universe starts with a clean slate, the evo
lution of life in local universes is a Sisyphean effort: it breaks down and
starts again from scratch, time after time. But local universes are not
subject to this ordeal. In each universe, complex systems leave their
traces in the vacuum, and the informed vacuum of one universe informs
the evolution of the next. Consequently, each universe creates condi
tions favorable to the evolution of life in successive universes. In each
successive universe, life evolves more and more efficiently, and thus in
equal times evolves further and further.
This is a cyclical process with a learning curve. Each universe starts
without life, evolves life when some planets become capable of supporting



140 Exploring the Informed Universe
it, and wipes it out when planetary conditions pass beyond the life
supporting stage. But the vacuum shared by all the universes records
and conserves the wave-form traces of the life that evolved in each uni
verse! The vacuum becomes more and more informed with life, and
therefore more and more informing of life.
Cyclically progressive evolution in the Metaverse offers a positive
prospect for the future of life: it can continue in one universe after
another. And it can evolve further, in universe after universe.
What can we say about the super-evolved forms of life that would
come about in the mature stages of mature universes? Since the course
of evolution is never precisely predictable, we can actually say very lit
tle. All we can surmise is that mature organisms in mature universes
will be more complex, more coherent, and more whole than the forms
of life familiar to us. In most other respects they could be as different
from the organisms we know on Earth as humans are different from the
protozoan slime that once populated the primeval seas of this planet.
A Footnote on Reality
We end the first part of our explorations of the informed universe with
a question that is meaningful but decidedly not modest: a question
about the nature of reality. We have already seen how our universe and
possibly myriad other universes in the Metaverse came into being, how
they evolve and devolve, and how they periodically give rise to the com
plex systems we call living. What do these stupendous processes tell us
about the fundamental nature of reality? What is it about this universe
that is primary and what is merely secondary, arising out of the reality
of the primary?
The answer to this age-old question is now relatively straightfor
ward. The primary reality is the quantum vacuum, the energy- and
information-filled plenum that underlies our universe, and all universes
in the Metaverse.
This answer corresponds to an ancient insight: that the universe we
observe and inhabit is a secondary product of the energy sea that was
there before there was anything there at all. Hindu and Chinese



The Origins and Destiny of Life and the Universe 141
cosmologies have always maintained that the things and beings that
exist in the world are a concretization or distillation of the basic energy
of the cosmos, descending from its original source. The physical world
is a reflection of energy vibrations from more subtle worlds that, in
turn, are reflections of still more subtle energy fields. Creation, and all
subsequent existence, is a progression downward and outward from the
primordial source.
In Indian philosophy the ultimate end of the physical world is a
return to Akasha, its original subtle-energy womb. At the end of time
as we know it, the almost infinitely varied things and forms of the man
ifest world dissolve into formlessness, living beings exist in a state of
pure potentiality, and dynamic functions condense into static stillness.
In Akasha, all attributes of the manifest world merge into a state that
is beyond attributes: the state of Brahman.
Although it is undifferentiated, Brahman is dynamic and creative.
From its ultimate "being" comes the temporary "becoming" of the
manifest world, with its attributes, functions, and relationships. The
cycles of samsara - of being-to-becoming and again of becoming-to
being - are the Ida of Brahman: its play of ceaseless creation and disso
lution. In Indian philosophy, absolute reality is the reality of Brahman.
The manifest world enjoys but a derived, secondary reality and mistak
ing it for the real is the illusion of maya. The absolute reality of
Brahman and the derived reality of the manifest world constitute a co
created and constantly co-creating whole: this is the advaitavada (the
nondualityj of the universe.
The traditional Eastern conception differs from the view held by
most people in the West. In the modern commonsense conception, real
ity is material. The things that truly exist are bits or particles of matter.
They can form into atoms, which can further form into molecules, cells,
and organisms - as well as into planets, stars, stellar systems, and
galaxies. Matter moves about in space, acted on by energy. Energy also
enjoys reality (since it acts on matter), but space does not: space is
merely the backdrop or the container against which, or in which, mate
rial things trace their careers.



142 Exploring the Informed Universe
This typically Western view is a heritage of the Newtonian world
concept. According to Newton, space is a mere receptacle and it is pas
sive in itself; it conditions how things actually behave but does not act
on them directly. Although it is empty and passive, space is nonetheless
real: it is an objective element in the universe. Subsequently, a number
of philosophers, including Gottfried Leibniz and Immanuel Kant, con
tested the reality Newton gave to space. In these views, space is noth
ing in itself; it is merely the way we order relationships among real
things. Space itself is not experienced, said Kant; it is only the precon
dition of experience.
The view that space is empty and passive, and not even real to boot,
is in complete opposition to the view we get from contemporary
physics. Even if physicists typically refuse to speculate on the ultimate
nature of reality (many hold such questions beyond the scope of their
discipline), it is clear that what they describe as the unified vacuum
the seat of all the fields and forces of the physical world - is in fact the
primary reality of the universe. Out of it have sprung the particles that
make up our universe, and when the last of the supergalactic black
holes "evaporates," it is into it that the particles fall back again. What
we think of as matter is but the quantized, semi-stable bundling of the
energies that spring from the vacuum. In the last count matter is but a
waveform disurbance in the nearly infinite energy-sea that is the funda
mental medium - and hence the primary reality - of this universe, and
of all universes that ever existed and will ever exist.

Consciousness:
Human and Cosmic
We continue now to query the informed universe. If this universe is the
cornerstone of an integral theory of everything, it should provide
answers to a further set of questions, centered not on the manifest facts
of nature and life, but on the more subtle facts of consciousness. The
questions we ask here are about:
- the roots of the phenomenon we know as consciousness
- the wider range of the information that reaches and forms our
(and any other) consciousness
- the next evolution of human consciousness
- the likelihood that consciousness exists elsewhere in the universe
- the possibility that our consciousness is immortal.
THE ROOTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
Contrary to a widespread belief, consciousness is not a uniquely human
phenomenon. Although we know only human consciousness (indeed,
by direct and indubitable experience we know only our own con
sciousness), we have no reason to believe that consciousness would be
limited to me and to you and to other humans.
The kind of evidence that could demonstrate the limitation of con
sciousness to humans regards the brain: it would be evidence that the
143



144 Exploring the Informed Universe
human brain has specific features by virtue of which it produces con
sciousness. Notwithstanding the view advanced by materialist scientists
and philosophers that the physical brain is the source of consciousness,
there is no evidence of this kind. Clinical and experimental evidence
speaks only to the fact that brain function and state of consciousness
are correlated, so when brain function ceases, consciousness (usually)
ceases as well. We should specify "usually," since there are exceptions
to this: in some well-documented cases - among others, those of
patients suffering cardiac arrest in hospitals - individuals have had
detailed and subsequently clearly recalled experiences during the time
their EEG showed a complete absence of brain function.
Functional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and other tech
niques show that when particular thought processes occur, they are
associated with metabolic changes in specific areas of the brain. They
do not show, however, how the cells of the brain that produce proteins
and electrical signals could also produce sensations, thoughts, emo
tions, images, and other elements of the conscious mind . . . how the
brain's network of neurons would produce the qualitative sensations
that make up our consciousness.
The fact that a high level of consciousness, with articulated images,
thoughts, feelings, and rich subconscious elements, is associated with
complex neural structures is not a guarantee that such consciousness is
due to these structures. In other words the observation that brain func
tion is correlated with consciousness does not ensure that the brain cre
ates consciousness.
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO
THE BRAIN-MIND PROBLEM
The view that consciousness is produced in and by the brain is
just one of the many ways philosophically inclined people have
envisaged the relationship between the physical brain and the



Consciousness: Human and Cosmic 145
conscious mind. It is the materialist way. It maintains that con
sciousness is a kind of by-product of the survival functions the
brain performs for the organism. As organisms become more
complex, they require a more complex "computer" to steer them
so they can get the food, the mate, and the related resources they
need in order to survive and reproduce. At a given point in this
development, consciousness appears. Synchronized neural firings
and transmissions of energy and chemical substances between
synapses produce the qualitative stream of experience that makes
up our consciousness. Consciousness is not primary in the world;
it is an "epi-phenomenon" generated by a complex material sys
tem: the human brain.
The materialist way of envisaging the relationship of brain
and mind is not the only way. Philosophers have also outlined
the idealist way. In the idealist perspective, consciousness is the
first and only reality; matter is but an illusion created by our
mind. This assumption, while outlandish on first sight, makes
eminent sense as well: after all, we do not experience the world
directly; we experience it only through our consciousness. We
normally assume that there is a qualitatively different physical
world beyond our consciousness, but that may be an illusion.
Everything we experience could be part of our consciousness.
The material world could be merely our creation as we try to
make sense of the flow of sensations in our consciousness.
Then there is the dualist way of conceiving of the relationship
between brain and consciousness, matter and mind. According
to dualist thinkers, mind and matter are both fundamental, but
they are entirely different, not reducible one to the other. The
manifestations of consciousness cannot be explained by the
organism that manifests them, not even by the staggeringly com
plex processes of the human brain - the brain is only the seat of
consciousness and is not identical with it.



146 Exploring the Informed Universe
In the history of philosophy, materialism, idealism, and dualism
were the principal ways of conceiving the relationship between brain
and mind. Materialism is still dominant today. Adherence to it poses
vexing problems. As the consciousness philosopher David Chalmers put
it, the problem it faces is how "something as immaterial as conscious
ness" can arise from "something as unconscious as matter." In other
words, how can matter generate mind} H o w the brain operates is a
comparatively "soft" problem that neurophysiologists will no doubt
solve step by step. But the question regarding the way in which "imma
terial consciousness" arises out of "unconscious matter" cannot be
answered by brain research, for that deals only with "matter," and mat
ter is not conscious. This is the "hard" problem.
Consciousness researchers of the materialist school admit to being
greatly perplexed by it. The philosopher Jerry Fodor points out that
"nobody has the slightest idea how anything material could be con
scious. Nobody even knows what it would be like to have the slightest
idea about how anything could be conscious." But philosophers who
do not take the materialist stance are not as disturbed. Peter Russell, for
example, says that Chalmers's problem is not just hard; it's impossible.
Fortunately, Russell adds (and we can agree), it does not need to be
solved, for it is not a real problem. We do not need to explain how
unconscious matter generates immaterial consciousness, because matter
is not entirely unconscious, nor is consciousness fully divorced from
matter.
We know that the "stuff" of the neurons in the brain comprises
quanta in complex configurations. But quanta are not mere uncon
scious matter! They stem from the basic constituents of the complex
fields that underlie the cosmos, and they are not devoid of the qualities
we associate with consciousness. As leading physicists such as Freeman
Dyson and philosophers of the stature of Alfred North Whitehead have
pointed out, even elementary particles are endowed with a form and
level of (proto) consciousness. To some extent and in some ways, all
matter is conscious, and no consciousness is categorically immaterial.
And if so, there is no categorical divide between matter and mind.



Consciousness: Human and Cosmic 147
David Chalmers's "hard" problem evaporates. Conscious matter at
a lower level of organization (the neurons in the brain) generates con
scious matter at a higher level of organization (the brain as a whole).
This does away with the hard problem of the materialist view without
doing the kind of violence to our everyday apprehension of the world
that idealism does (according to which all is mind, and nothing but
mind). It also does away with the problem of dualism - one that is just
a shade less "hard" than that of materialism - because if matter and
mind interact (as they must interact in the brain), then we must still say
how "something as unconscious as matter" can act on, and be acted on
by, "something as immaterial as consciousness."
The "ism" by which we can best identify the emerging solution to
the classical brain/mind problem is evolutionary panpsycbism.
Panpsychism is the philosophical position that claims that all of reality
has a mental aspect: psyche is a universal presence in the world.
Qualifying "panpsychism" with "evolutionary" means that we do not
claim that psyche is present throughout reality in the same way, at the
same level of development. We say that psyche evolves, the same as
matter. But we affirm that both matter and mind - physis and psyche
were present from the beginning: they are both fundamental aspects of
reality.
In affirming that in the course of time physis and psyche evolved
together, we do not reduce all of reality to structures made up of in
themselves inert and insentient material building blocks (as in material
ism), nor do we assimilate all of reality to a qualitative nonmaterial
mind (as in idealism). We take both matter and mind as fundamental
elements of reality but (unlike in dualism) we do not claim that they are
radically separate; we say that they are but different aspects of the same
reality. What we call "matter" is the aspect we apprehend when we
look at a person, a plant, or a molecule from the outside; "mind" is the
readout we get when we look at the same thing from the inside.
Of course, for each of us the inside view is available only in regard
to our own brain. It is not the complex network of neurons that we see
when we inspect what we assume to be the felt contents of our brain,



148 Exploring the Informed Universe
but a complex stream of ideas, feelings, intentions, and sensations. This
is the stream of our consciousness with its manifold conscious and also
subconscious elements. But it is not this stream that we apprehend
when we inspect anybody else's brain-mind. What we get is the neuro
scientist's view of a network of neurons firing in complex loops and
sequences.
The limitation of the inside view to our own brain does not mean
that we alone are conscious and everyone else is but a neurophysiolog
ical mechanism operating within a biochemical system. Both views
the outside as well as the inside - must be present in all human beings.
And not only in all humans, but also in all other biological organisms.
And not only in organisms, but also in all the systems that arise and
evolve in nature, from atoms to molecules, to macromolecules, to
ecologies. In the great chain of evolution, there is nowhere we can draw
the line, nowhere we could say: below this there is no consciousness,
and above there is.
This panpsychist concept has been espoused by philosophers over
the ages, in modern times most eloquently by Alfred North Whitehead.
It was also affirmed by the Apollo astronaut Edgar Mitchell.
According to Mitchell, all things in the universe have a capacity to
"know." Less evolved forms of matter, such as molecules, exhibit more
rudimentary forms of knowing - they "know" to combine into cells.
Cells " k n o w " to reproduce and fight off harmful intruders; plants
" k n o w " to turn toward the sun, birds to fly south in winter. The
higher forms of knowing, such as human awareness and intention,
have their roots in the cosmos; they were there right from the start, at
the birth of our universe.
The idea that mind and knowing are universal in nature is shared
by Freeman Dyson. "Matter in quantum mechanics," he said, "is not
an inert substance but an active agent, constantly making choices
between alternative possibilities. . . . It appears that mind, as manifested
by the capacity to make choices, is to some extent inherent in every
electron."
In the final count we must recognize that all the things that arise



Consciousness: Human and Cosmic 149
and evolve in the universe have both a matter-aspect and a mind-aspect.
All things in the world - quanta and galaxies, molecules, cells, and
organisms - have "materiality" as well as "interiority." Matter and mind
are not separate, distinct realities; they are aspects of a deeper reality that
has both an external matter-aspect, and an internal mind-aspect.
THE WIDER INFORMATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS
Is the information reaching our consciousness limited to our bodily
senses - do we see the world through "five slits in the tower"? Or can
we "open the roof to the sky"? The informed universe gives us not only
a new view of the world, but also a new view of life and of mind. It per
mits our brains and minds to access a broad band of information, well
beyond the information conveyed by our eyes and ears. We are, or can
be, literally "in touch" with almost any part of the world, whether here
on Earth or beyond in the cosmos.
When we do not repress the corresponding intuitions, we can be
informed by things as small as a particle or as large as a galaxy. This,
we have seen, is the finding of psychiatrists and psychotherapists who
place their patients in an altered state of consciousness and record the
impressions that surface in their minds. It was also astronaut Mitchell's
outer-space experience. In a higher state of consciousness, he remarked,
we can enter into deep communication with the universe. In these states
the awareness of every cell of the body coherently resonates with what
Mitchell identifies as "the holographically embedded information in the
quantum zero-point energy field."
We can reconstruct how this "broad-band" information reaches our
mind. We have seen that, according to the new physics, the particles and
atoms - and the molecules, cells, organisms, and galaxies - that arise and
evolve in space and time emerge from the virtual energy sea that goes by
the name of quantum vacuum. These things not only originate in the vac
uum's energy sea; they continually interact with it. They are dynamic enti
ties that read their traces into the vacuum's A-field, and through that field
enter into interaction with each other. A-field traces - the holograms they



150 Exploring the Informed Universe
create - are not evanescent. They persist and inform all things, most
immediately the same kind of things that created them.
This holds true for our body and brain as well. All we experience in
our lifetime - all our perceptions, feelings, and thought processes - have
cerebral functions associated with them. These functions have wave
form equivalents, since our brain, like other things in space and time,
creates information-carrying vortices - it "makes waves." The waves
propagate in the vacuum and interfere with the waves created by the
bodies and brains of other people, giving rise to complex holograms.
Generations after generations of humans have left their holographic
traces in the A-field. These individual holograms integrate in a super
hologram, which is the encompassing hologram of a tribe, community,
or culture. The collective holograms interface and integrate in turn with
the super-superhologram of all people. This is the collective information
pool of humankind.
We can read the information carried by these holograms. On the
principle of "like informs like," we can read first of all the information
carried by the hologram of our own brain and body. Reading out what
we have read into the field is the physical basis of long-term memory. It
removes the limitation on information storage by a brain enclosed in a
finite cranium. We can read out anything and everything that we have
read into the field - we can literally "re-call" from it all the things we
have ever experienced.
Not only we ourselves, but others also can read out at least some
of what we have read into the A-field. This is because the hologram of
our body and brain can "conjugate" with the holograms of other peo
ple, especially people who are related to us and with whom we have an
emotional bond. Aside from cases of clairvoyance and mystical or
prophetic insight, the readout is not in the form of explicit words or
events, but rather in the form of intuitions and sensations. The most
widespread and hence familiar among these are "twin pain" and the
sudden revelatory intuitions of mothers and lovers when their loved
ones are hurt or undergo a traumatic experience.
In the everyday context, of course, our readout is restricted to our



Consciousness: Human and Cosmic 151
own read-in. This restriction is fortunate: it is a precondition of con
serving our sanity. If the experience of many people reached us simul
taneously and frequently, we would be overwhelmed - we could not
sort out the information. Given the holopattern selectivity of our
brain's readout - the limited way our own hologram meshes with the
hologram of others - we are not swamped by the enormity of the infor
mation in the A-field.
This does not mean that human experience must be limited to five
slits in the tower. By entering an altered state of consciousness, we can
open the roof to the sky, but we must be prepared to cope with the
information that is then reaching us.
THE NEXT EVOLUTION OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS
Our consciousness is not a permanent fixture: cultural anthropology
testifies that it developed gradually in the course of millennia. In the
thirty- or fifty-thousand-year history of modern man, the human body
did not change significantly, but human consciousness did. It evolved
from simpler beginnings and, if humankind survives long enough, it
will evolve further.
Different levels of human consciousness, with progressive evolution
from the lowest to the highest, were envisaged by almost all the great
spiritual traditions. For example, some Native American cultures (the
Mayan, Cherokee, Tayta, Xingue, Hopi, Inca, Seneca, Inuit, and
Mapuche traditions) hold that we are presently living under the Fifth
Sun of consciousness and are on the verge of the Sixth Sun. The Sixth
Sun will bring a new consciousness and with it a fundamental transfor
mation of our world.
A number of thinkers attempted to define the specific steps or
stages in the evolution of human consciousness. The Indian sage Sri
Aurobindo considered the emergence of superconsciousness in some
individuals as the next step; in a similar vein the Swiss philosopher Jean
Gebser spoke of the coming of four-dimensional integral consciousness,



152 Exploring the Informed Universe
rising from the prior stages of archaic, magical, and mythical con
sciousness. The American mystic Richard Bucke portrayed cosmic con
sciousness as the next evolutionary stage of human consciousness,
following the simple consciousness of animals and the self-consciousness
of contemporary humans. Ken Wilber's six-level evolutionary process
leads from physical consciousness pertaining to nonliving matter
energy through biological consciousness associated with animals and
mental consciousness characteristic of humans to subtle consciousness,
which is archetypal, transindividual, and intuitive. It leads in turn to
causal consciousness and, in the final step, to the ultimate conscious
ness called Consciousness as Such. And Chris Cowan's and Don Beck's
colorful spiral dynamics sees contemporary consciousness evolving
from the strategic "orange" stage that is materialistic, consumerist,
and success-, image-, status-, and growth-oriented; to the consensual
"green" stage of egalitarianism and orientation toward feelings,
authenticity, sharing, caring, and community; heading toward the eco
logical "yellow" stage focused on natural systems, self-organization,
multiple realities, and knowledge; and culminating in the holistic
"turquoise" stage of collective individualism, cosmic spirituality, and
Earth changes.
Ideas such as these differ in specific detail, but they have a common
thrust. Consciousness evolution is from the ego-bound to the transper
sonal form. If this is so, it is a source of great hope. Transpersonal con
sciousness is open to more of the information that reaches the brain
than the dominant consciousness of today. This could have momentous
consequences. It could produce greater empathy among people, and
greater sensitivity to animals, plants, and the entire biosphere. It could
create subtle contact with other parts of the cosmos. It could change
our world.
A society hallmarked by transpersonal consciousness is not likely to
be materialistic and self-centered; it would be more deeply and widely
informed. Under the impact of a more evolved consciousness, the sys
tem of nation-states would transform into a more inclusive and coordi
nated system with due respect for diversity and the right of all peoples



Consciousness: Human and Cosmic 153
and cultures to self-determination. Economic systems would remain
diversified but not fragmented; they would combine local autonomy
with global coordination and pursue goals that serve all the peoples and
countries of the world, whatever their creed, level of economic devel
opment, population size, and natural resource endowment. As a result,
disparities in wealth and power would be moderated and frustration
and resentment would diminish, together with crime, terrorism, war,
and other forms of violence. Societies would become more peaceful and
sustainable, offering a fair chance of life and well-being to all their
members, living and yet to be born.
Will this condition, in today's perspective distinctly Utopian, actu
ally come about? This we cannot say: evolution is never fully pre
dictable. All we can say is that if humankind does not destroy its
life-supporting environment and decimate its populations, the domi
nant consciousness of a critical mass will evolve from the ego-bound to
the transpersonal stage. This evolution is certain to leave its mark on
people and societies. When our children and grandchildren graduate to
transpersonal consciousness, an era of peace, fairness, and sustainabil
ity could dawn for humanity.
COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS
We can now take another step in our exploration of the informed uni
verse: a step beyond the consciousness associated with organisms and
other complex systems. Could the cosmos itself possess consciousness
in some form?
Through the ages, mystics and seers have affirmed that conscious
ness is fundamental in the universe. Seyyed Hossein Nasr, a medieval
Islamic scholar and philosopher, wrote, "[T]he nature of reality is
none other than consciousness. . . . " Sri Aurobindo concurred: "[A]ll
is consciousness - at various levels of its own manifestation . . . this uni
verse is a gradation of planes of consciousness." Scientists have occa
sionally joined the ranks of the mystics. Sir Arthur Eddington noted,
"[T]he stuff of the universe is mind-stuff . . . the source and condition



154 Exploring the Informed Universe
of physical reality." And the Nobel laureate biologist George Wald said
that mind, rather than emerging as a late outgrowth in the evolution of
life, has existed always.
Nearly two-and-a-half thousand years ago Plato recognized that in
regard to ultimate questions there can be no certainty: the best we can
do is to find the most likely story. In the contemporary context, the like
liest story is that consciousness is universal in nature. Its roots extend
to the heart of physical reality: to the quantum vacuum. We know that
this subtle virtual energy sea is the originating ground of the bound
energy wave-packets we view as matter, and we now have excellent
grounds to assume that it is the originating ground of mind as well.
How could we tell that the vacuum is not only the seat of a super
dense virtual energy field from which spring wave-packets we call mat
ter, but also a cosmically extended proto- or root-consciousness? There
is no way we could tell by ordinary sensory experience. First, because
we cannot observe vacuum fields, we can only conclude their existence
by reasoning from the things we can observe. Second, because con
sciousness is "private," we cannot ordinarily observe it in anyone other
than ourselves. The claim that the vacuum is both a virtual energy field
and a field of proto-consciousness is condemned to remain hypotheti
cal, even if supported by indirect evidence.
There are, however, positive approaches we can take. To begin with,
even if we cannot directly observe consciousness in the vacuum, we
could attempt an experiment. We could enter an altered state of con
sciousness and identify ourselves with the vacuum, the deepest and most
fundamental level of reality. Assuming that we succeed (and psychother
apists tell us that in altered states people can identify with almost any
part or aspects of the universe), would we experience a physical field of
fluctuating energies? Or would we experience something like a cosmic
field of consciousness? The latter is much more likely. We have already
noted that when we experience anybody else's brain "from the outside,"
we do not experience his or her consciousness - at the most we experi
ence gray matter consisting of complex sets of neurons firing in complex
sequences. But we know that when we experience our brain "from the



Consciousness: Human and Cosmic 155
inside," we experience not neurons, but the qualitative features that
make up our stream of consciousness: thoughts, images, volitions, col
ors, shapes, and sounds. Would not the same hold true when we project
ourselves into a mystical union with the vacuum?
This is not just a fanciful supposition: there is indirect yet signifi
cant evidence for it. It comes from the farther reaches of contemporary
consciousness research. Stanislav Grof found that in deeply altered
states of consciousness, many people experience a kind of conscious
ness that appears to be that of the universe itself. This most remarkable
of altered-state experiences surfaces in individuals who are committed
to the quest of apprehending the ultimate grounds of existence. When
the seekers come close to attaining their goal, their descriptions of what
they regard as the supreme principle of existence are strikingly similar.
They describe what they experience as an immense and unfathomable
field of consciousness endowed with infinite intelligence and creative
power. The field of cosmic consciousness they experience is a cosmic
emptiness - a void. Yet, paradoxically, it is also an essential fullness.
Although it does not feature anything in a concretely manifest form, it
contains all of existence in potential. The vacuum they experience is a
plenum: nothing is missing in it. It is the ultimate source of existence,
the cradle of all being. It is pregnant with the possibility of everything
there is. The phenomenal world is its creation: the realization and con
cretization of its inherent potential.
Basically, the same kind of experience is recounted by people who
practice yoga and other forms of deep meditation. The Indian Vedic
tradition, for example, regards consciousness not as an emergent prop
erty that comes into existence through material structures such as the
brain and the nervous system, but as a vast field that constitutes the
primary reality of the universe. In itself, this field is unbounded and
undivided by objects and individual experiences, but it can be experi
enced in meditation when the gross layers of the mind are stripped
away. Underlying the diversified and localized gross layers of ordinary
consciousness there is a unified, nonlocalized, and subtle layer: "pure
consciousness."



156 Exploring the Informed Universe
According to traditional cosmologies, the universe's undifferentiated, all-encompassing consciousness separates off from its primordial unity and becomes localized in particular structures of matter. In the new scientific context we can specify that the proto-consciousness of the quantum vacuum becomes localized and articulated as particles emerge from it and evolve into atoms and molecules. On life-bearing planets they evolve further into cells, organisms, and ecologies. The human mind, associated with the highly evolved human brain, is a highlevel articulation of the cosmic consciousness that, emerging from the vacuum, infuses all things in space and time.
IMMORTALITY AND REINCARNATION
Last but not least we ask the most exciting of all the great questions people have ever asked. Could our consciousness survive the physical demise of our body?
We can also shed light on this perennial question, but not by applying the usual methods of the sciences. It does not help to examine the human brain, for if consciousness continues to exist when brain function ceases, it is no longer associated with the brain. It is more to the point to look at the evidence furnished by instances where consciousness is no longer directly linked with the brain. This is the case in neardeath experiences, out-of-body experiences, past-life experiences, some varieties of mystical and religious experiences, and, perhaps most significant of all, the experiences of after-death communication. Until recently, scientists could not cope with such "paranormal" experiences; they did not fit into the materialist scheme of scientific thinking. But the informed universe is not the materialist's kind of universe. Let us take a fresh look at the phenomena, and see what kind of explanation we can now find for them.
Immortality
In near-death experiences, out-of-body experiences, past-life experi
ences, and various mystical and religious experiences, people perceive



Consciousness: Human and Cosmic 157
things that were not conveyed by their eye, ear, or other bodily senses. As we have seen, in NDEs the brain can be clinically dead, with the EEG "flat," and yet people can have clear and vivid experiences that, when they come back from the portals of death, they can recall in detail. In OBEs people can "see" things from a point in space that is removed from their brain and body, while in mystical and religious transport, experiencing subjects have the sense of entering into union with something or someone larger than themselves, and indeed larger or higher than the natural world. Although in some of these experiences the consciousness of individuals is detached from their physical brain, their experiences are vivid and realistic. Those who undergo them seldom doubt that they are real.
In addition to NDEs, OBEs, and mystical experiences, another remarkable form of experience has surfaced in recent years: experience in which there appears to be contact and communication with people who are no longer alive. This kind of experience became known as ADC: after-death communication.
Many people seem to experience after-death communication; the NDE researcher Raymond Moody collected a wide variety of "visionary encounters with departed loved ones." Mediums such as James Van Praagh, John Edward, and George Anderson have mediated contact with numerous deceased people by describing the impressions they receive from them.
ADCs have also been known to occur randomly and spontaneously, without anyone mediating them or guiding the experience. And now psychotherapists have learned to induce such experiences. Allan Botkin, a qualified psychotherapist, head of the Center for Grief and Traumatic Loss in Libertyville, Illinois, and colleagues claim to have successfully induced ADCs in nearly three thousand patients.
It appears that ADCs can be induced in about ninety-eight percent of the people who agree to try them. Usually the experience comes about rapidly, almost always in a single session. It is not limited or altered by the grief of the subject or his or her relationship to the deceased. It also does not matter what the experiencers believed prior



158 Exploring the Informed Universe
to undergoing the experience; they could have been deeply religious,
agnostic, or convinced atheists. ADCs can occur also in the absence of
a personal relationship with the deceased - for example, in combat vet
erans who feel grief for an anonymous enemy soldier they had killed.
And they can occur without guidance by the psychotherapist. Indeed,
as Dr. Botkin reports, leading the experiencing subject actually inhibits
the unfolding of the experience. It is sufficient that the therapist induces
the mental state necessary for the experience to occur. This state is a
slightly altered state of consciousness, brought about by means of a
series of rapid eye movements. Known as "sensory desensitization and
reprocessing," it produces a receptive state in which people are open to
the impressions that appear in their consciousness.
Typically, the experience of after-death communication is clear,
vivid, and thoroughly convincing. The therapists hear their patients
describe communication with the deceased person, hear them insist that
their reconnection is real, and watch repeatedly as their patients move
almost instantly from an emotional state of grieving to a state of relief
and elation.
MARK'S EXPERIENCE OF
AFTER-DEATH COMMUNICATION*
About twenty-five years ago Mark was embarking on a success
ful professional career when one night, driving alone, he was
blinded by car lights and strayed into the path of an oncoming
car. He was not injured, but the young family in the other car,
father, mother, and twelve-year-old girl, were killed. Mark's life
changed from that day; he awoke each morning to deep sadness
and severe guilt, and plodded through the day reliving the acci
dent over and over again. He twice attempted suicide, had two
* Reported in Botkin and Hogan, Reconnections: The Induction of After-Death Communications in Clinical Practice,



Consciousness: Human and Cosmic 159
failed marriages, and was on the verge of losing his job. Life
appeared to have ended for him. He then tried an ADC experi
ence induced by Dr. Botkin. Following the brief interval of eye
movement desensitization and reprocessing, Mark sat quietly,
with closed eyes. After a moment he said, "I can see them. It's
the family with the little girl. They're standing together and
smiling .. . Oh God, they look happy and peaceful. They're very
happy being together and they're telling me they very much like
where they are." Mark continued: "I can see each one very
clearly, and especially the girl. She's standing in front of her
mom and dad. She has red hair, freckles, and a wonderful smile.
I can see the dad walking around, like he's showing me how he
can walk. I have the feeling from him that he had multiple scle
rosis before he died, and he is really happy he can now move
around freely." Mark told the family that he is very sorry about
what had happened and heard them say that they forgive him.
He felt as if a huge burden had been lifted from him.
Mark had never actually seen the family; because of his deep
grief and depression, he refused to look at pictures or read
reports about them. But after the ADC experience he was feel
ing so much better that he stopped by his sister's house and
looked at clippings of the accident. He said that he "freaked
out." The newspaper pictures were very clearly of the same fam
ily he had experienced in his ADC, down to the smallest detail,
such as the smile and the freckles of the girl. And there was a
still more remarkable aspect: the father showing happily that he
can walk. The newspapers reported that he indeed had multiple
sclerosis at the time he died . . .
Mark's experience is fairly typical. In ADCs people experi
ence the person they grieve for as happy and well, often younger
than they were at the time they died. This "reconnection" with
the deceased relieves and often fully resolves the grief weighing
on the mind of the experiencer.



160 Exploring the Informed Universe
Clearly, ADCs have remarkable therapeutic value. But what do they
mean? Are they grief-induced delusions? Botkin argues that they are
not: they do not fit any of the known categories of hallucinations. If so,
are they real: do the subjects actually encounter the deceased for whom
they are grieving? That would suggest that the deceased still exists in
some way, perhaps in another dimension of reality. This would be true
immortality: the survival of the person after the physical demise of the
body. This is a hopeful conclusion, but it is not likely to be true. There
is another, more plausible, explanation and the informed universe can
furnish it. It is simple and basic. At every moment throughout our life
we read what we think, feel, and perceive into the A-field, a holo
graphic field that preserves the experiences of our entire lifetime.
The A-field carries the holograms of our body and brain, and also
carries the holograms of the communities in which we participate and
of the milieu in which we live. Every element of these holograms can be
individually retrieved by our brain. Retrieving the elements of our own
hologram gives us the astonishingly complete and encompassing mem
ory store that comes to light in near-death experiences and other altered
states of consciousness. It extends to all things we have ever experi
enced in our lifetime, including our experience of the womb and of
birth.
But this is not all: we can also read out the holograms of other peo
ple, and thereby relive their experiences. The people whose experiences
we relive may be living or dead; the holograms in which their lifetime
experiences are encoded do not phase out in time. As long as there are
humans on this planet - and humanoid beings on other planets in the
universe - the lived experiences of all people can be relived, over and
over again.
When other people read out our own experience, we live again in
their experience. When we read out other people's experience, they live
again in our experience. And when we enter into communication with
a person whom we grieve for, we do not communicate with that person
directly, but read in the A-field the holograms created by his or her
body and brain. These are complex, multiplex holograms that encom



Consciousness: Human and Cosmic 161
pass the experience of an entire lifetime. We have seen that in altered
states of consciousness people often communicate with the deceased
they grieve for not as they were at the time of their death, but how they
were earlier in life. This is possible and it stands to reason. Seeing one's
loved ones as young and healthy is more conducive to alleviating and
resolving one's grief than seeing them old and suffering.
The conclusion is evident. We as individuals are not immortal, but
our experience is. The traces of everything we have ever experienced
persist, and they can be forever recalled.
Prophets, philosophers, and spiritual people have often taken the
traces we leave in the A-field as evidence for an immortal soul. Plato
spoke of the immortality of the Soul, the aspect of the human being that
springs from, and then returns to, the realm of eternal Forms or Ideas.
Hegel considered the human mind the self-actualization of what he
called the Absolute Idea through its temporal embodiments. Bishop
Berkeley viewed the human mind as a reflection of the Divine Mind, the
quintessence of the world's reality. Alice Bailey's intuitions match the
latest insights from science remarkably: she located the source of
human immortality in the "ether." "This word 'ether,'" she wrote, "is
a generic term covering the ocean of energies which are all interrelated
and which constitute that one synthetic energy body of our planet . . .
the etheric or energy body, therefore, of every human being is an inte
gral part of the etheric body of the planet itself."
Gustav Fechner, the pragmatic founder of experimental methods in
psychology, expressed the same idea in surprisingly definite terms.
"When one of us dies," he wrote after recovering from an illness, "it is
as if an eye of the world were closed, for all perceptive contributions
from that particular quarter cease. But the memories and conceptual
relations that have spun themselves round the perceptions of that per
son remain in the larger Earth-life as distinct as ever, and form new rela
tions and grow and develop throughout all the future, in the same way
in which our own distinct objects of thought, once stored in memory,
form new relations and develop throughout our whole finite life."
Nothing in this world is evanescent; all things continue to exist



162 Exploring the Informed Universe
through the traces they leave in the cosmic information field. We
humans, too, create an Akashic record of our lifetime experiences, a
record that can be retrieved by others. Our individual experience is not
limited to ourselves and to our individual lifetime. It can be reexperi
enced and thus relived at any time and at any place, today and at all
times in the future.
Reincarnation
Understanding that it is the A-field - the information field of the cosmos
that confers immortality on us and not an individual immortal soul
gives us a different perspective on reincarnation. This perspective is
fully consistent with the evidence we have of reincarnation, which con
sists of impressions and ideas recounted by people about sites, people,
and events they have not and could not have encountered in their pres
ent lifetime. It is then assumed that they encountered them in previous
lifetimes. These "past-life experiences" have an element of truth in
them, but that does not guarantee that such experiences come truly
from a past life.
"Past-life stories" crop up routinely in the experience of psy
chotherapists who practice regression analysis. They place their patients
in a slightly altered state - hypnosis is not needed, since breathing exer
cises, rapid eye movements, or simple suggestion is usually sufficient
and take them back from their current experiences to the experiences of
their past. They can often move their patients back to early childhood,
infancy, and physical birth. Experiences that seem to be those of gesta
tion in the womb surface as well.
Interestingly, and at first quite unexpectedly, psychotherapists have
found that they can take their patients back further than the womb and
physical birth. After an interval of apparent darkness and stillness,
other experiences appear. They are of other places and other times. Yet
the patients not only recount them as the experience of a novel they
have read or a film they have seen, but actually relive them as well. As
Stanislav Grof's records testify, they become the person they experience,
even to the inflection of voice, the language (which may be one the



Consciousness: Human and Cosmic 163
patient has never known in his or her present lifetime), and, if the
experience is of infancy, the involuntary muscle reflexes that character
ize infants.
Ian Stevenson, of the University of South Carolina, investigated the
past-life experiences recounted by children. During more than three
decades Stevenson interviewed thousands of children, in both the West
and the East. He found that from the age of two or three, when they
begin to verbalize their impressions, until the age of five or six, many chil
dren report identification with people they have not seen, heard of, or
encountered in their young lives. Often these reports can be verified as the
experience of a person who had lived previously, and whose death
matches impressions reported by the child. Sometimes the child carries a
birthmark that is associated with the death of the person with whom she
or he identifies - such as an indentation or discoloration on the part of
the body where a fatal bullet entered, or malformations on the hand or
foot the deceased had lost or had wounded.
The experiences reported by children - and by grown-ups in altered
states of consciousness - actually occur, and they show that we can
access the experiences of other people whether they stand before us or
are far away, and whether they are living today or have lived sometime
in the past. But when we reexperience other people's experiences we do
not reincarnate them, for the images and ideas that surface in our con
sciousness stem not from single individuals whose soul has survived
their death and is now reincarnated in us. Rather, the ideas, images, and
impressions entering our consciousness have their source in the vac
uum. The information carried in the vacuum's A-field is active and
effective. Its range is vast; it embraces other humans as well as other
forms of life, and all things in the universe. In integrating with it, it is
not our individual body and our individual soul, but our individual
experience that achieves immortality.
We do not disappear from the world without a trace; all that we
experience becomes part of the collective memory bank of humankind,
to be read out again and again. We can live on in the brain and con
sciousness of people today, and in all future generations.



NINE
The Poetry of Cosmic Vision
At the cutting edge of the sciences, a new concept of the world is emerg
ing. In this concept all things in the world are recorded and all things
inform one another. This gives us the most encompassing vision we
have ever had of nature, life, and consciousness. It gives us an integral
theory of everything.
In this concluding chapter, we apprehend the new world concept
not as a rationally argued scientific theory, but as a poetic vision that
conveys its spontaneous feel. This is important. If the rediscovered
information- and memory-filled universe is the best insight we have
ever had into the nature of reality, we should know it not only with our
rational faculties; we should apprehend it also with our creative imagi
nation. We should not just grasp it with our intellect, but also feel it in
our hearts and in our guts.
Here, then, is a vision that is imaginative but not imaginary: the
feeling-portrait of the universe that is now emerging at the frontiers of
the sciences.
Imagine, if you will, a ligbtless, soundless, formless plenum. It is filled
both with the primeval consciousness that is the womb of all mind and
spirit in the cosmos and with the fluctuating energies out of which all
things come to exist in space and in time. There is no-thing in this cosmic
fullness, yet there is every-thing, in potential. Everything that can and will
ever happen is here, in formless, soundless, lightless, quiescent turbulence.
164



The Poetry of Cosmic Vision 165
After an infinity of cosmic eons, a sudden explosion, untold mag
nitudes greater than any turbulence ever witnessed or even imagined by
human beings, penetrates the formless turbulence; a shaft of light rises
from its epicenter. The plenum is no longer quiescent; it is rent by a
supercosmic force emerging from its hitherto soundless and lightless
depth. It liberates gigantic forces, transforming the plenum from virtual
formlessness into dynamic formative process. The surface foams with
instantly appearing and disappearing ripples of energy, forming and
annihilating in a cosmic dance of unimaginable speed and momentum.
Then the initial demented rhythm becomes more sedate, the foam more
orderly. The ripples radiate outward from the epicenter, bathed in pure
light of infinite intensity.
As the foam expands, it becomes grainier. Swirls and vortexes
appear, incipient if as yet evanescent wave-patterns modulating the sur
face of the evolving plenum. With the passing of further cosmic eons, the
ripples of patterned energy consolidate into lasting forms and structures.
They are not separate from each other, for they are micro-patterns struc
turing into larger patterns within a common wave-field. They are part of
the underlying and now no longer formless plenum that erupted and cre
ated them. Each ripple is a microworld in itself, pulsating with the lib
erated energies of the plenum and reflecting in its micrototality the
macrototality from which it emerged.
The micro-patterns trace their careers in the expanding space of the
initial explosion and take on structure and complexity. They modulate
the turbulent plenum. It is more and more structured at the surface, as
the ripples cohere into complex wave-structures; and it is more and more
modulated below, as the evolving structures create minute vortices that
integrate into information-carrying holograms. The informed holofield
below and the micro-patterns on the surface evolve together. Their
growing architecture enriches the holofield, and the enriched holofield
in-forms the evolving micro-structures. Surface and depth coevolve, tak
ing on complexity and coherence.
The more complex the structures that emerge, the more independ
ent they appear of the depth below. Yet the ripples and waves at the



166 Exploring the Informed Universe
surface are not separate but part of the medium from which they arise - they are like "solitons," the curiously object-like waves that emerge in a turbulent medium.
The ripples and waves cohere in elaborate structures, subtly interconnected with each other. At a crucial stage of their evolution they become self-sustaining, reproducing themselves and replenishing spent energies from the embedding energy fields.
The evolving wave-patterns have not just external relations; they also have an inner reflection: a "feel" of each other and of the depth. At first an unarticulated basic sensation, this inner reflection gains in articulation as the self-maintaining waves acquire structure and complexity. They develop higher and higher grades of inner reflection, articulating their basic feel of the world as a representation of individual things and processes. They map the world that envelops them, and themselves in that world.
After another cosmic eon, the energies liberated by the initial explosion dissipate across the surface of the plenum. Some mega-structures use up the free energies available to them and explode, strewing their micro-ripples into space where they consolidate into new megastructures. Others implode, and in a final flash reenter the plenum from which they emerged. The ripples that evolve on the surface of smaller mega-structures break down, incapable of maintaining themselves in an environment of fading energy. As the universe ages, all complex structures and articulated reflections disappear. But although the surface loses modulation, the memory of the depth is not affected: the holograms created by the ripples remain untouched. They conserve the trace of the surface's evanescent structures together with their feels and reflections.
And now another shaft of light rends the plenum, breaking its quiescent turbulence and reviving it with another formative burst: a new universe is born. This time the ripples and structures that form on the surface do not appear randomly, at the mercy of chance: they derive from a plenum in-formed with the holo-trace of prior ripples and waves.



The Poetry of Cosmic Vision 167
The cosmic drama repeats time after time. Further shafts of light radiate outward from the epicenter, another multitude of ripples moves outward to dance, to cohere, to feel, and to reflect. The new universe ends as the ripples and the structures it brought into being vanish at the surface. But the holograms created by them in the depth inform the next universe, born as further explosions rend the plenum. Time after time, the cosmic drama repeats, but it does not repeat in the same way. It builds on its own past, on the memory of the ripples and waves that appeared and then disappeared in prior universes.
In universe after universe the plenum brings forth micro-ripples and mega-wave stuctures. In each universe the ripples and waves vanish, but their memory lives on. In the next universe new and more elaborate structures appear, with more articulated reflections of the world around them.
In the course of innumerable universes, the pulsating Metaverse realizes all that the primeval plenum held in potential. The plenum is no longer formless: its surface is of unimaginable complexity and coherence; its depth is fully informed. The cosmic proto-consciousness that endowed the primeval plenum with its universe-creative potentials becomes a fully articulated cosmic consciousness - it becomes, and thenceforth eternally is, the self-realized mind of God.



An Autobiographical
Retrospective
Forty Years in Quest of the Integral Theory of Everything
Science and the Akasbic Field is the product of four decades of search
ing for meaning through science. I started on this quest in the spring of
1959, shortly after my first son was born. Until then my interest in
philosophical and scientific questions had been just a hobby - I had
been traveling the world as a musician, and nobody, not even I, had
ever suspected that it would become more than an intellectual pastime.
But my interest in finding a meaningful and encompassing answer to
what I experienced and knew about life and the universe grew, and the
quest that began in 1959 became an all-consuming vocation. It culmi
nated four decades later in the spring of 2001, as I sat down to draft
out The Connectivity Hypothesis, my latest theoretical work. The pres
ent book, summarizing my findings for the general readership, followed
in 2002-2004.
My enduring interest has been to find an answer to questions such
as "What is the nature of the world?" and "What is the meaning of my
life in the world?" These are typically philosophical questions
although the majority of today's academic philosophers prefer to hand
them to theologians and poets - yet I did not seek to answer them
through theoretical philosophy. While I was not an experimental scien
tist (and given my background and interest I was not attempting to
168



An Autobiographical Retrospective 169
become one), I did have a strong sense that the best way to tackle these
questions is through science. Why? Simply because empirical science is
the human endeavor that is the most rigorously and systematically ori
ented toward finding the truth about the world, and testing its findings
against observation and experience. I wanted the most reliable kind of
answers there are, and reflected that I could find no better source for
them than science.
For a young man in his twenties without formal background in a
specific field of science, this was quite presumptuous. I would like to
call what I had intellectual courage, but at the time I did not feel espe
cially courageous - just curious and committed. Nonetheless, I was not
entirely unprepared, for I had done a good deal of prior reading (mostly
on planes and trains and in hotel rooms) and took part in various col
lege and university courses. Being a successful concert pianist, I never
enrolled for an academic degree for which I saw no conceivable use.
In 1959 I turned over a new leaf: I set about doing systematic read
ing and research. What was until then a favorite hobby became a method
ical quest. I started with the foundations of science in classical Greek
thought and moved to the founders of modern science before turning to
contemporary science. I was interested neither in the technical details
that take up the lion's share of the training of science professionals
techniques of research, observation, and experimentation - nor in con
troversies about methodological or historical fine points. I wanted to
get straight to the heart of the matter: to find out what a given sci
ence could tell me about the segment of nature it investigates. This
required a good deal of spadework. The findings were unexpectedly
sparse, consisting of a few concepts and statements, usually at the
end of extensive mathematical and methodological treatises. They
were, however, extremely valuable, much like nuggets of gold that
come to hand after sifting through streams of water and mountains
of ore.
In the course of the 1960s, I learned to do my sifting rapidly and
efficiently, covering a good deal of ground. What meaning I found half
buried in particular fields I jotted down, and attempted to bring it into



170 Exploring the Informed Universe
relation with what I found in other fields. I did not intend to write a
treatise or create a theory, I just wanted to understand what the world
and life - my life, and life in general - are all about. I made copious
notes, but never expected that they would get into print. How they did
so is one of the curious episodes of my life.
After a successful concert in The Hague, I found myself sitting at
late supper next to a Dutchman who brought up some of the very ques
tions that fascinated me. I got into conversation with him, and ended
by going up to my hotel room to show him the notes I always had with
me. He retired into a corner and began reading. Shortly after that he
disappeared. I was concerned, since I had no copy. However, the next
morning my newfound friend reappeared with my notes under his arm.
He announced that he wanted to publish them. This was a surprise, for
I knew neither that he was a publisher (he turned out to be the philos

nor that my notes would merit publication. Of course, they required a
good deal of completing and organizing before they could be published
in book form. But published they were, a year and a half later (Essential
Society: An Ontological Reconstruction, 1963).
The experience in The Hague reinforced my determination to pur
sue my quest. I joined the Institute of East European Studies at
Switzerland's University of Fribourg, and for several years combined
writing and research with concert work. I came out with another, less
theoretical, book shortly after the first (Individualism, Collectivism,
and Political Power, 1963) and a few years later published another
philosophical treatise (Beyond Scepticism and Realism, 1966). The
period of writing and researching combined with concertizing came to
an end when, in 1966, I received an invitation from Yale University's
Department of Philosophy to spend a semester there as visiting fellow.
Accepting that invitation was a major decision, for it meant exchanging
the concert stage for the life of an academic.
The decision to go to Yale - which led to teaching appointments at
various U.S. universities and, in 1969, to a Ph.D. at the Sorbonne in
Paris - gave me the opportunity to pursue my quest full time. Although



An Autobiographical Retrospective 171
in any established university there is considerable pressure to keep to
the rather narrowly defined territory of one's own field, I never wavered
from the conviction that there is meaning to be discovered in the world
at large, and that the best way of discovering it is to query the theories
put forward by leading scientists in all the relevant fields, not just those
that belong to one's area of specialization. I was fortunate in finding
colleagues - first at Yale, then at the State University of New York
who understood this conviction and helped me overcome the academic
hurdles that would have stood in the way.
The search for meaning through science called for considerable time
and energy. I soon realized that, like Archimedes, I needed firm ground
from which to start. I found two basic alternatives. One was to start
with the stream of one's own conscious experience and see what kind
of world one could logically derive from that experience. The other was
to gather all the information one can about the world at large, and then
see if one can account for one's own experience as the experience of that
world. The former has been the method of the empirical schools of
Anglo-Saxon philosophy and of that branch of continental philosophy
that took its cue from Descartes, and the latter the method of natura
listic metaphysics and science-based philosophy. I read up on these
schools, paying special attention to Bertrand Russell and Alfred Ayer
among the British philosophers, Edmund Husserl and the phenomenol
ogists of the continental schools, and Henri Bergson and Alfred North
Whitehead among the naturalistic process philosophers. I concluded
that neither the formal analysis of experience nor the introspective
method of the phenomenologists leads to a meaningful concept of the
real world. These schools ultimately get bogged down in what philoso
phers call the "ego-centric predicament." It appears that the more sys
tematically one investigates one's immediate experience, the less easy it
is to get beyond it to the world to which that experience presumably
refers. We are logically obliged to take the initial leap of assuming the
objective existence of the external world, and then to create the scheme
in light of which our experience makes sense as the human experience
of that world.



172 Exploring the Informed Universe
In Beyond Scepticism and Realism, I contrasted the "inferential"
approach that starts from one's own experience with the alternative
"hypothetico-deductive" method that envisages the nature of the world
and explores how our observations accord with it. I concluded that,
ideally, the overlap between these distinct and sometimes seemingly
contradictory approaches is what gives the most reliable information
about the real nature of the world. I identified some areas of overlap,
but did not stop there: I wanted to get on with my quest, and began to
explore the bold hypothetico-deductive approach. To my considerable
relief, I found that this approach had been adopted by many great
philosophers and practically all theoretical scientists, from Newton and
Leibniz to Einstein and Eddington.
Einstein stated the principal premise of the naturalistic approach.
"We are seeking," he said, "for the simplest possible scheme of thought
that will bind together the observed facts." The simplest possible
scheme, I realized, cannot be inferred from observations: as Einstein
said, it needs to be imaginatively envisaged. One must search for and
codify the relevant observations, but one cannot stop there. While
empirical research is necessary, the creative task of putting together the
resulting data in ways that they make sense as meaningful elements of
a coherent system cannot be neglected. It is the principal challenge fac
ing the inquiring mind. The attempt to "create the simplest possible
scheme of thought that will bind together the observed facts" (and by
"observed facts" I meant all the facts needed to make sense of the
world) defined my intellectual agenda for the next four decades.
The scheme I first envisaged rested on the organic metaphysics of
Whitehead. In this conception, which dated originally from the 1920s,
the world and all things in it are integrated and interacting "actual enti
ties" and "societies of actual entities." Reality is fundamentally
organic, so living organisms are but one variety of the organic unity
that emerges in the domains of nature. My subsequent readings in cos
mology and biology confirmed the soundness of this assumption. Life,
and the cosmos as a whole, evolves as integrated entities within a net
work of constant formative interaction. Each thing not only "is," it also



An Autobiographical Retrospective 173
"becomes." Reality, to cite Whitehead, is process, and an integrative
evolutionary process at that.
The question I asked was how I could identify the evolving entities
of the world in such a way that they would make sense as elements in
an organically integral universe. Colleagues at Yale called my attention
to the work of Ludwig von Bertalanffy in the area of "general system
theory." Bertalanffy was attempting to integrate the field of biology in
an overall scheme that would lend itself to further integration with
other domains of natural science, and even with the human and social
sciences. His key concept was "system," conceived as a basic entity in
the world. Systems, he argued, appear in similar ("isomorphic") ways
in physical nature, living nature, as well as the human world. This was
most helpful: it supplied the conceptual tool I was looking for. I read
Bertalanffy, then met with him and developed the concept of what we
jointly decided to call "systems philosophy."
Introduction to Systems Philosophy (1972) was a painstakingly
researched book - it took five years to write - and when it was pub
lished I was tempted to rest for a while on my laurels. But I was not sat
isfied. I needed to find an answer in leading-edge science not only to
how systems are constituted and how they relate to each other, but also
to how they change and evolve. Whitehead's metaphysics gave me the
general principles and Bertalanffy's general system theory clarified the
relations between systems and environments. What I still needed was
the key to understanding how these relations can lead to integrative and
on the whole irreversible evolution in the biosphere, and in the universe
as a whole.
To my surprise, the key was furnished by a discipline about which
I knew little at the time: nonequilibrium thermodynamics. I reached this
conclusion on the basis of my brief but intense friendship with Erich
Jantsch, who died unexpectedly a few years later. He directed my atten
tion to the work, and subsequently to the person, of the Russian-born
Nobel laureate thermodynamicist Ilya Prigogine. The latter's concept of
"dissipative structures" that are subject to periodic "bifurcations" fur
nished the evolutionary dynamic I needed. After discussing this concept



174 Exploring the Informed Universe
with Prigogine, my work focused on what I called "general evolution
theory." The basic kind of entity that populates the world transformed
in my thinking from Whitehead's "organism" and Bertalanffy's "gen
eral system" to Prigogine's nonlinearly bifurcating "dissipative struc
ture," an evolving thermodynamically open system. The world began to
make more and more sense.
Apparently, the sense I made of the world also intrigued scholars in
fields other than systems theory and philosophy. While teaching and
researching at the State University of New York at Geneseo, to my sur
prise I received a phone call from Richard Falk, of Princeton
University's Center of International Studies. Falk, one of the foremost
"world system" theorists of the time, asked me to come to Princeton to
lead a series of seminars on the application of my systems theory to the
study of the international system. I assured him that I knew next to
nothing about the international system and had only vague notions of
how my theory would apply to it. But Falk was not to be deterred. He
and his colleagues, he said, would see to the application of my theory if
I would come and discuss that theory with them. This I agreed to do.
The experience of my Princeton seminars was intellectually reward
ing as well as exciting: it opened new vistas. I found a new and intensely
practical application for general system theory, systems philosophy, and
general evolution theory: human society and civilization. Society and
civilization, I realized in the mid-1970s, are undergoing a process of
irreversible transformation. The human world is growing beyond the
bounds of the nation-state system to the limits of the globe and the
biosphere. This called for rethinking some of our most cherished
notions about how societies are structured, how they operate, and how
they develop. With valuable input from Richard Falk and other
Princeton colleagues, I spelled out my evolutionary conception of the
world system in A Strategy for the Future: The Systems Approach to
World Order (1974).
Strategy elicited attention beyond academia. Another call followed,
this time from Aurelio Peccei, the visionary Italian industrialist who
founded the world-renowned think tank known as the Club of Rome.



An Autobiographical Retrospective 175
He suggested that I apply the systems approach to the "limits to
growth" problem, focusing not on the limits themselves (as Jay
Forrester and Dennis and Donella Meadows did in the first report to
the club, The Limits to Growth), but on the ambitions and motivations
that drive people and societies to encounter the limits. This invitation
was an intellectual challenge with major practical relevance - it could
not be refused. I took a leave of absence from my university and moved
to the UN headquarters in New York. Davidson Nicol, executive direc
tor of the UN's Institute of Training and Research (UNITAR), invited
me to join his institute in order to create the international team that was
to work on this project. Within a year, some 130 investigators on six
continents were enlisted in creating the Club of Rome's third report,
focusing on humankind's "inner" rather than "outer" limits (Goals for
Mankind: The New Horizons of Global Community, 1977).
Having finished the report, I repaired to my university to resume
researching, writing, and teaching. This, however, was not to be. A fur
ther call from Nicol asked me to represent UNITAR at the founding of
the United Nations University in Tokyo, and when I filed my report
Nicol asked me to stay on at the institute to head research on the
hottest subject of the day, the "new international economic order." This
was another challenge that could not be ignored. After three years of
intense work, fifteen volumes written with collaborators from ninety
research institutes in every part of the world were published in a series
created for this purpose by Pergamon Press of Oxford: the New
International Economic Order Library. The NIEO Library was to pro
duce background documentation for the General Assembly's landmark
General Session of 1980, which was to launch the "global dialogue"
between the developing South and the industrialized North. But the big
powers of the North refused to enter the dialogue and the UN system
dropped the project of the new international economic order.
When I was about to return to my university to pursue at last my
principal quest, UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim asked me to sug
gest other ways in which North-South cooperation could be pursued.
The proposal I made to him and to UNITAR was based on systems



176 Exploring the Informed Universe
theory: it was to insert another "systems level" between the level of
individual states and the level of the United Nations. This was the level
of regional social and economic groupings. The project, called Regional
and Interregional Cooperation, was adopted by UNITAR and took four
years of intense work to carry out. In 1984 I reported the results in four
bulky volumes that accompanied a declaration of a specially convened
"panel of eminent persons." Due to internal politics, the declaration
was not handed to the secretary-general and thus could not be made
into an official document, but its text was circulated to all member-state
delegations. Disappointed with this outcome but hopeful that sooner or
later the proposals contained in the declaration would bear fruit, I
decided that I had merited a sabbatical year. I moved with my family to
our converted farmhouse in Tuscany. That sabbatical year, begun in
1982, has not yet come to an end.
However, the 1980s and '90s turned out to be much more than a
"read and write" sabbatical. It was a time of increasingly intense inter
national commitments. In the 1980s I was involved in discussions at the
Club of Rome, then took a major part in the United Nations
University's European Perspectives project. Subsequently, I served as
science adviser to Federico Mayor, the two-term director-general of
UNESCO. But since 1993 the brunt of my attention was focused on the
Club of Budapest, the international think-tank I founded that year to
do what I had hoped the Club of Rome would do: center attention on
the evolution of human values and consciousness as the crucial factors
in changing course - from a race toward degradation, polarization, and
disaster to a rethinking of values and priorities so as to navigate today's
transformation in the direction of humanism, ethics, and global sus
tainability. As reports to the Club of Budapest I wrote Third
Millennium: The Challenge and the Vision (1997) and most recently
You Can Change the World: The Global Citizen's Handbook for Living
on Planet Earth (2003).
Notwithstanding these activities and commitments, I remained
faithful to my basic quest. When in 1984 I left the United Nations for
the Tuscan hills, I took stock of how far I had gotten. I found that I



An Autobiographical Retrospective 177
needed to go further. Systems theory, even with the Prigoginian
dynamic, provided a sophisticated but basically local explanation of
how things relate and evolve in the world. The open system dynamic of
evolution refers to particular systems; their interaction with other sys
tems and the environment constitutes what Whitehead termed "exter
nal" relations. Yet Whitehead affirmed that in the real world all
relations are internal: every "actual entity" is what it is because of its
relations to all other actual entities. With this in mind, I set about
reviewing the latest findings in quantum physics, evolutionary biol
ogy, cosmology, and consciousness research, and found that the idea
of internal relations is entirely sound. Things in the real world are
indeed strongly - "internally," "intrinsically," and even "nonlocally"
connected and correlated with each other.
Internal relations also bind our own consciousness with the con
sciousness of others. This was brought home to me by a personal expe
rience that I recounted in 1993 in the preface to Creative Cosmos and
will not repeat here. Although a mystical experience does not provide
proof of internal relations between one's mind and the mind of others,
it does provide an incentive to study the possibility that such relations
exist. This consideration became part of my explorations in the years
that followed.
The science books I have produced in this "Tuscan period" are - in
addition to the book in the hands of the reader - The Creative Cosmos
(1993), The Interconnected Universe (1995), The Whispering Pond
(1997-98), and The Connectivity Hypothesis (2003). In these books I
marshal evidence that things in the real world are intrinsically inter
connected, and suggest the reason for it. The theory of the information
field - which I first called the psi-field and am now calling the "A" (for
Akashic)-field - provides that reason. It claims that the connections and
correlations that come to light in the physical and the life sciences, the
same as the transpersonal ties that emerge in experimental parapsy
chology and consciousness research, have one and the same root: a sub
tle but entirely fundamental coherence- and correlation-creating field at
the heart of the universe. Further clarifying and codifying the nature



178 Exploring the Informed Universe
and effects of this field would be of the utmost importance. It would bring science significantly closer to Einstein's (and to my) ultimate goal of finding the "simplest possible scheme that can bind together the observed facts."
My recent books, culminating with Connectivity Hypothesis and Science and the Akashic Field, state, I believe, the essential framework for the simplest possible scheme that can bind together the remarkable facts that are now coming to light at the cutting edge of the sciences.
THE AUTHOR'S JOURNEY MIRRORED IN COMMENTS BY SOME OF THE FOREMOST SCIENTISTS AND THINKERS OF OUR TIME
Ludwig von Bertalanffy on systems philosophy:
"Laszlo's pioneering work develops systems philosophy both in breadth
and depth. As he argues convincingly, contemporary 'analytic' philoso
phy is in danger of 'analyzing itself out of existence' . . . What we need,
says Laszlo, is rather a 'synthetic' philosophy, that is, one which
receives new inputs from the various developments in modern science
and tries to follow the other way in philosophy, namely, endeavors to
put together the precious pieces of specialized knowledge into a coher
ent picture. . . . "
"Laszlo's work is the first comprehensive treatise of 'systems philosophy' No one who looks beyond his own specialty and narrow interests will be able to deny the legitimacy of this quest."
FOREWORD TO INTRODUCTION TO SYSTEMS PHILOSOPHY (1972)
Richard Falk on systems theory applied to the world system:
"We cannot be optimistic about the future of the human species unless we envisage a rather drastic restructuring of social, economic, and political life on the planet. . . . One encouraging development is the increasing number of serious efforts . . . to find the means to build the sort of world society that has the capacity to deal with the problems



An Autobiographical Retrospective 179
confronting humankind. Among these intellectual efforts none is more
significant than the work of Ervin Laszlo, who has brought to bear the
well-developed framework of general systems analysis on the specific
task of constructing a just and viable system of world order. In A
Strategy for the Future, Laszlo portrays with intellectual power and
originality the contours of a desirable world system and provides a
carefully interrelated concept of how we get from here to there."
" . . . world-order studies are, I think, with Laszlo's help being liberated
from their literary and sentimental origins and achieving the status of a
new academic discipline of normative content that deals with evidence,
explanation, and prediction. . . . What Laszlo provides . . . is a frame
work based on systems theory that can accommodate information
drawn from any discipline or perspective and an insistence that the
future of the human race is too important to be left in the hands of
statesmen, generals, cartelists, and the like - who, in any event, are dis
astrously confined by the predispositions and interest structure of the
state system."
" . . . I believe Laszlo has put us on the right track in an innovative and
exciting way. His leadership in the systems area is itself one element in
a new movement for global reform taking place among intellectuals
throughout the world. In my view, anyone concerned with the future of
humankind and eager to take part in its creation has a special obliga
tion to read what Laszlo has written. His book deserves to be one of the
main texts for the reeducation of the mind that must occur if we are
ever to become both good citizens and good people."
INTRODUCTION TO A STRATEGY FOR THE FUTURE (1974)
Jonas Salk on general evolution theory:
"In this book Ervin Laszlo has turned his integrating mind to the task
of bringing together observations that reveal the operation of the laws
of nature in evolving emergent systems of increasing complexity. . . .
The grand sweep of evolution over the expanse of time that has thus far



180 Exploring the Informed Universe
elapsed is revealed in this book in a form that is useful for the nonsci
entist and the scientist alike."
"There is emerging a new literature on the subject of evolution, one that
has expanded far beyond the limits of the work of Darwin and Wallace,
who first made us aware of evolution in the origin of species. Since then
evolution has come to be seen in a wider context. It is now seen in its
universality, in its universal presence, and in its absence, as when
species cease to evolve and are no longer able to persist. We now see the
meaning of this in the human realm with the emergence of the capacity
to evolve as the most valuable of all human attributes."
"It is for this reason that we need to understand evolution fundamen
tally if we are to be able to maintain our place in the evolutionary
scheme of things as an evolving species. . . . This book will help make
us aware of the awesome challenge that this turn of events presents to
us and to future generations. Can we rise to it? Time will tell. Do we
have enough time? I presume that we do, provided we don't waste it.
That's the meaning of the surge in interest in evolution in our time to
which this useful, comprehensive, and illuminating book is a response."
FOREWORD TO EVOLUTION:
THE GRAND SYNTHESIS (1987)
Ilya Prigogine on systems and evolution theory applied to the
contemporary world:
". . . Laszlo's study [The Age of Bifurcation] represents a remarkable
coincidence: at this very moment, mankind is living through a crucial
time of transformation while science is undergoing a spectacular tran
sition. More and more, an ever-increasing number of scientists perceive
that a new paradigm is taking shape. Everywhere we see fluctuations,
evolution, diversification. This is true not only on the level of macro
scopic phenomena, as in chemistry, but also on the microscopic level in
particle physics and on the vast scale of modern cosmology."
"The title of this book, The Age of Bifurcation, is well chosen because



An Autobiographical Retrospective 181
with the concept of bifurcation the historical category of 'event' enters
contemporary science. An event is something that cannot be determin
istically predicated. The position of the Earth around the Sun in a given
number of years could hardly be considered an event, while obviously
the birth of Mozart was an event in the history of Western music."
" . . . we now have hope that with our achievements, both theoretical and
experimental, with our immensely improved capacity of producing
wealth, and with our new facilities for interpersonal communication, we
can come at last to a form of civilization where an increasing number of
people have the possibility to manifest the creativity which, I believe, is
present in every human being. Is this the beginning of such a new age?
We are still too heavily involved in the planetary transformation under
way to reach a firm evaluation, but perhaps - and this is my hope
succeeding generations will see our time as the beginning of a great age
of bifurcation - and will look upon this book as the herald to that age."
FOREWORD TO THE AGE OF BIFURCATION:
UNDERSTANDING THE CHANGING WORLD (1991)
Arne Naess on the holistic theory of the A-field (also called the quantum/vacuum interaction hypothesis):
"The creative work of Ervin Laszlo is a brilliant testimony of how con
ceptual imagination - deductively related to careful observation - can
make us see the cosmos, and our place within the cosmos, in new ways
that are of great inspirational value. Reality as conceived by Ervin
Laszlo has what I call 'gestalt character' - a predominance of internal
rather than external relations."
"A central part of Laszlo's conceptual framework is the quantum/vac
uum interaction (QVI) hypothesis. This is a highly sophisticated theory,
rather than a hypothesis, in my terminology. . . . Greatly simplified, one
might say that Laszlo envisions a world that is constantly created, and
here every event that happens locally, even an event in one's conscious
ness, is connected with events that happen everywhere else."



182 Exploring the Informed Universe
"There are many of us in science and philosophy who wish to see a
growing trend of bold theory formulation inspired by such courageous
yet unpretentious efforts as the present study by Ervin Laszlo."
FOREWORD TO THE INTERCONNECTED UNIVERSE (1995)
Karl Pribram on the holistic theory of the A-field (also called
the quantum/vacuum interaction hypothesis):
"The Creative Cosmos is a superb example of postmodern deconstruc
tion at its very best. Its first two parts demonstrate the anomalies and
lacunae in the current narrative we call science. The next sections
boldly develop a new narrative that aims to carry our comprehension
beyond these limitations. . . .The narrative aspects of science, the con
cepts and meanings to which the computations point, have been neg
lected, often deliberately as in the ever-popular Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum physics. This neglect has produced consider
able malaise in some of us, and more important, it has led to a cover
up of the anomalies and lacunae addressed in The Creative Cosmos.
[This book] ably summarizes what is missing in today's account of
science-as-narrative. Of course, Laszlo is not alone in his lament.
Einstein, Dirac, Bohm and Bell have all attempted to understand their
formulations in physics; Koestler, in biology and psychology. But the
received wisdom in the classroom has, for the most part, emphasized
the elegance of what has been achieved often with the advice that any
attempt at further understanding would simply confuse."
"Laszlo is to be commended in that he provides us with a plausible
alternative. All of the scientists noted above have groped in the direc
tion now taken by Laszlo. He points out, that as the twentieth century
comes to a close, scientists are again becoming more comfortable with
the concept of 'field', which has been eclipsed for most of the century
by an almost exclusive emphasis on the particulate."
"Gravitation, electromagnetic, the strong and weak nuclear forces have
all become relatively familiar, at least to scientists, because their



An Autobiographical Retrospective 183
inferred properties do not invoke any radical departure from the meas
urements that have served scientists so well. . . . [T]he postulated fifth
field [the A-field] is different. It is not inferred from an interaction
among spatially and temporally separated entities. As Bohm has
described it, space and time become implicate, enfolded.
Mathematically, the fifth field is spectrally, holographically organized.
The organization is composed of interference patterns, that is, of the
amplitudes (amounts) of energy present at intersections among wave
forms. . . . The fifth field is thus not a simple inference from observa
tions. Rather, the fifth field is a transformation of fields which are
inferred from observations."
"Laszlo has, indeed, filled the need for a twenty-first century renewal
of the narrative of science which has been so neglected during the twen
tieth century."
FOREWORD TO THE CREATIVE COSMOS (1993)
Karan Singh on the holistic theory of the A-field (also called the quantum/vacuum interaction hypothesis):
"Perhaps the most significant development in recent times which,
though the subject of several important books, has still not received the
attention it deserves, is the growing convergence between the mystical
worldview (predominantly, but by no means exclusively, Eastern) and
the emerging paradigm of reality among scientists at the cutting edge of
contemporary knowledge. The Whispering Pond, the latest in Ervin
Laszlo's important series mapping out the geography of reality, makes
this point, and does much to rectify it."
"With astonishing incisiveness and clarity, The Whispering Pond pro
pounds a breathtaking vision. Its most significant upshot is that the sce
narios of cosmic fate are likely to be open; fate and destiny are not
sealed, and the future may not only happen but could also be created."
"In the light of the globalization of human civilization taking place



184 Exploring the Informed Universe
before our very eyes, the evolution of a global consciousness is urgently needed if mankind is not to destroy itself and all life on this planet by its inability to responsibly manage its technological ingenuity. For such a global consciousness to arise, a worldview in which science and spirituality converge is a necessary development. The publication of The Whispering Pond is a significant step in this direction."
FOREWORD TO THE WHISPERING POND (1996)
David Loye on the holistic theory of the A-field (also called the quantum/vacuum interaction hypothesis):
"The Whispering Pond is an enormous contribution to our understanding at a critical time in human evolution. It gives us the vital new fragments of emergent 'truth' in language we can understand. And it provides the even more vital sense of the meaningful whole into which these fragments fit, which we have been lacking. This book, and the pioneering scientific study it is based on - Laszlo's The Interconnected Universe - call[s] to mind that watershed statement of the 18th century, The Critique of Pure Reason. There a philosopher with a similarly amazing capacity for integration - Immanuel Kant - so transcended in his synthesis the science and philosophy of his time as to establish a new framework for practically all of modern thought. It will be interesting to see if history repeats itself."
FOREWORD TO THE WHISPERING POND (1996)
Ken Wilber on today's revolution of consciousness:
"Ervin Laszlo can only be called a genius of systems thinking. In books too numerous to mention - my favorites include The Systems View of the World, Evolution: The Grand Synthesis, The Choice, The Whispering Pond, and Third Millennium - Ervin Laszlo has, probably more than any person alive, intricately spelled out a staggering but often neglected fact: we live in a hopelessly interconnected universe,
With e a c h and every single thing, c o n n e c t e d in a l m o s t mirculous w a y s

to each and every other. His work, spanning four decades, has been a
clear and consistent call to recognize the richly interwoven tapestry that
constitutes our world, our lives, our hopes and our dreams. By rising to
a vision of the whole, he has helped countless individuals escape the
narrow limitations and depressing fragments that have haunted the
modern world for at least three centuries."
FOREWORD TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS REVOLUTION (1999)
Ralph Abraham on The Connectivity Hypothesis:
"The new science of life of Sheldrake tries to restore vitalism to biology.
The archetypal psychology of Jung, Hillman, and Moore tries to bring
it back into psychology. Along with many others, these efforts may be
seen as a New Renaissance. Amid the milieu of this paradigm shift,
Ervin Laszlo stands out as the unique champion of a holistic philosophy
of the broadest perspective. For his bold plan is to unify all - quantum,
cosmos, life, and consciousness - in a single grand unified model. When
a great grand unified theory will appear it will very likely conform to
the prophetic vision of Ervin Laszlo."
FOREWORD TO THE CONNECTIVITY HYPOTHESIS (2003)
Christian de Quincey on The Connectivity Hypothesis:
"Laszlo has put together a remarkable summary of some of the latest
findings in sciences such as quantum mechanics, cosmology, neuro
science, and consciousness studies, along with his renowned expertise
in systems and complexity theory. He has woven together key elements
from each of these sciences to make one of the most coherent cases yet
for a radically different worldview based on the subquantum domain of
the zero-point energy field, or what he calls 'the psi (A-field) field.' "
COMMENT ON THE CONNECTIVITY HYPOTHESIS



186 Exploring the Informed Universe
Stanislav Grof on T h e Connectivity Hypothesis:
"This is a brilliant summary of the major conceptual challenges for the
Cartesian-Newtonian paradigm, which has dominated Western scien
tific thinking for the last three centuries. Laszlo outlines the areas in
quantum physics, astrophysics, biology, and psychology where these
disciplines encountered observations that they could not account for.
But he does not stop there; he offers an elegant interdisciplinary model
that could help to reconcile the existing paradoxes. Ervin Laszlo is a
world-class scientist and his contributions are groundbreaking."
