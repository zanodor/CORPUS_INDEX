The Hungarian chronicles do not write about Romanians, if I read the original Latin text, I can see there is nothing about the Romanians, just the Romanian propagandaTM converts arbitrarily some
uncertain blurry words to “Romanian”.
Almost every other nation and country in Europe has a very clear, very rich, very well documented
history: rulers, kings, heroes, generals, noble families, battles, crowns, coins, archeology items, cities, buildings, own state documents, chronicles, church documents, city documents, important
events, stories, relationships with other countries...etc. And also the old contemporary documents of the countries always mention each other, like the English documents say many things about
France, German documents say many things about Hungary and inverse, etc. But the allegedly “super ancient” Romanians have just almost nothing of these things in medieval times, despite the
Romanians are saying fiercely they are “super ancient” in the Carpathian Basin. Furthermore, they state that they are more ancient in Transylvania than in Wallachia in the Romanian core land. The
first Romanian document is the Neacsu's letter, which was written in 1521 and used Cyrillic. The Romanians do not like the Hungarians despite they like to use always what the Hungarians have,
but of course, the Romanians use many double standards regarding these documents because outside these blurry words the Romanians are refusing the other and large part of the same
documents. So the Romanians are cherry-picking just only some blurry words from non-Romanian old Hungarian documents, and they convert these words arbitrarily to “Romanian” to find
desperately some history and to create a false history to justify why Romania got huge 1000 years of Hungarian lands in 1920 from the Entente.
In 1987, the Gesta acquired particular notoriety on account of a full-page advertisement in The Times, paid for by the Romanian government, affirming the validity of the chronicler’s account of “a
Romanian presence in the Carpathian Basin” more than a thousand years before.
Of course, the Hungarian historians are refusing this fantasy by the Romanian historians regarding
the Hungarian chronicles.
Carlile Aylmer Macartney (1895–1978) was a British academic specializing in the history and
politics of East-Central Europe and in particular the history of Austria and Hungary.

Book: The medieval Hungarian historians: a critical and analytical guide (Publication date 1953)



Let's see the original Hungarian chronicle! (And not the incorrect translation for propaganda purposes.)
Anonymus: Gesta Hungarorum (11–12th century)
The Romanians say “Blasii” means “Romanian”. Only this is the “huge written evidence” for the Romanian presence in the Carpathian Basin before the foundation of Hungary. I am always talking
about the Carpathian Basin and not about somewhere else because this is the disputed territory between Hungarians and Romanians. The Romanians also say the Romanians lived not only in
Transylvania but the Romanians “inhabited” Pannonia too, today west Hungary. But the Romanians are unable to show any other written evidence than these non-contemporary Hungarian chronicles,
moreover as we can see this “evidence” is very distorted. Also, no other sources know about Vlachs in the Carpathian Basin at that time. Outside referring to Hungarian chronicles in this blurry
way, the Romanians are unable to show any other contemporary (8–11th century) written sources that know any Romanian presence in the Carpathian Basin at that time. So it is very ridiculous that
the “allegedly super ancient” Romanians in the Carpathian Basin have only this “evidence” for their previous alleged existence as the Romanian history fabrication states this. We can also compare
this “huge” Romanian history with the other nations in Europe, and we can see clearly a very big difference.
I think the most ironic thing is the massive double standard by the Romanian propagandaTM. The Romanians believe some blurry uncertain words mean “certain Romanian” but the Romanians deny
the other much longer clearly written part of the Hungarian chronicles. The same chronicle clearly writes many things on many pages about the relationship of Hungarians, Huns, Scythian. There are
many stories about this connection in the book, moreover, we have many other and much older contemporary foreign sources that say exactly the same, also thanks to modern science, the
archaeogenetic proved this connection. Gesta Hungarorum also says the Székelys (a Hungarian group in Transylvania) are the descendant of the Huns, they are the remnant of the Huns, the
people of Attila. Of course, the Romanians say this is not true, because the Romanians want in any case to imagine themself in Transylvania first before the Hungarians to justify why Romania got a
huge Hungarian land in 1920 from the Entente, which land belonged was Hungarian 1000 years



long. We can see the Romanians have a selective belief in this Hungarian chronicle: one word
(after the arbitrary conversion) is true, but clearly written many pages that supports many other historical sources, archeological and genetic evidence is not true according to the Romanians.
The chronicle also writes many Transylvanian Hungarian stories from the 10–11th century. The Hungarian "Gyula" meant the second-highest title in the Hungarian tribal confederation. Gyula's
ancestor was among the seven chieftains of the conquering Hungarians, who finally settled in Transylvania, Gyula's family ruled Transylvania. After the coronation, King Saint Stephen of
Hungary asserted his claim to rule all lands dominated by Hungarian lords. King Stephen I personally led his army against his maternal uncle, and Gyula III surrendered without a fight,
Transylvania was incorporated with the Kingdom of Hungary. But I also see many Romanians say always that Transylvania was not part of the Kingdom of Hungary until 1200-1300 and they say the
Hungarians conquested Transylvania very slowly 300 years long in many stages and the Hungarians defeated Romanian warlords even in the 13th century. Does anybody know about
these mystic Romanian warlords?! If we see the official international maps, Transylvania is clearly a Hungarian land from 900. Of course, the Romanians are unable to provide any evidence or
contemporary sources about this absurd statement, and I also do not know any local enemy with whom the Hungarians would have fought for a long time. Moreover, archeologists found many
Hungarian cemeteries in Transylvania from the 10th century, while we do not know about any Vlach cemetery. As we can see Romanian history falsification has two methods: they try to convert many
Hungarian things, events, persons to Romanian things, and in the other way, they try to shorten the Hungarian history. Some absurd examples: Romanians say that King Saint Stephen of Hungary
was “Romanian”, the Hungarian Turul bird came from “Romanians”, and of course, all Hungarians are just "hungarianized Romanians”...etc. Gesta Hungarorum clearly says Transylvania was
conquested by Árpad's Hungarians, the Székelys as the remnant of Huns lived in Transylvania since the time of Attila, and we also can see many stories about the Hungarian Gyulas in
Transylvania in the 10th century that match with the Byzantine sources. I think it is very ironic when Romanians are refusing these clearly written things in Gesta Hungarorum, but they like to prove
desperately that some uncertain words mean “Romanians” in the same book.
But the Romanians play this double standard game too with the later Hungarian chronicles. When
we talk about the origin of John Hunyadi the Romanians like to refer to the chronicle of Thuróczy and Bonfini. These authors mention many theories, but the Romanians select only the Wallachian
theory and they always forget or deny the other theories. Bonfini and many other contemporary Hungarian sources write very detailed things about the Battle of Baia (1467) and these old
documents say King Matthias of Hungary won that battle, of course, the Romanians are denying this and they say it was a “decisive Romanian victory”, however in the next year, Moldavia became
Hungarian vassal... But we can see the Romanians like only those words in that documents which could be favorable for them.
The Romanians are always talking about a “large and always majority Romanian population” 1100 years ago in the territory of today Hungary and Transylvania, of course without any evidence.
Where are the contemporary Hungarian and foreign sources about this? Where is the archeology of “the allegedly large Romanian population”, where are the cemeteries? I think without contemporary
sources this statement is just a fantasy category, speculation, and cheap propaganda because mainly a large population should live in big settlements and not top of the tree in million number, it
should be agriculture, international relations, trading, coins, buildings, cities, rulers, etc... and we should have many written sources about “the allegedly large Romanian population”, just we do not
have any info about these hidden Romanians. I suppose if many million Romanians would have been lived in Transylvania 1100 years ago, then Anonymus would have mentioned them, as he
wrote many details about many nations in his chronicle.
I don't care if the Romanian propaganda translates the “Blasii” word to “Vlach”, but still, I can see
”Blasii” in the original Latin text, I really don't know this word how can be “Vlach”. Moreover, the text says “Geleou” was the leader of “Blasii and Sclaui”, a group in Transylvania. The Romanian
propagandaTM entertainment factory says that the Hungarians say: “the Hungarians arrived in an empty land”. As a Hungarian, I can confirm I never heard this nonsense in Hungary, even
Anonymus mention many folks in the territory in his chronicle. And we know very well the Carpathian Basin was not empty when Árpad’s Hungarians arrived. There were Avars who made a
strong circa 300 years state and they have rich archeological sites and cemeteries in the Carpathian Basin, later East Franks and Bulgarians defeated the Avar state, but according to the
contemporary sources, the Avar population was present when the relative Hungarian tribes arrived,



moreover many foreign contemporary high ranked authors write Huns = Avars = Hungarians. We
also know many sources about Slavs, Bulgarians, Germans too. But of course, this is not a problem for the Romanian propaganda to say always that “the Hungarians say this land was empty”.
The Avar state at the beginning of the 9th century, Pannonia was occupied by Franks/Bavarians, the east part of the Carpathian Basin was occupied by the Hun relative Bulgarians.
Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum (871) called the Avars as Huns, who ruled Pannonia after the Romans and German tribes, and before the Franks. The document says the Avars became
Christians and live in Pannonia after the Frank conquest. The contemporary source does not know about any “Romanians” as no other contemporary sources know about any Romanian in the
territory of the Carpathian Basin at that time.
"So far it has been recorded how the Bavarians became Christians, and the list of the bishops and
abbots of the Salzburg Archbishopric has been compiled. Now it must be added how the Slavs, who are also called Carantans and their neighbours received teaching in the Holy Faith and how
they became Christians, and the Huns drove out the Romans, the Goths and the Gepids from Pannonia Inferior, and held it until the Franks and the Bavarians, together with the Carantans,
harassing them in continuous warfare finally defeated them. Those who took up their religion and accepted Christianity the kings made their tax-payers and by the tax payed to the king they are to
the present day entitled to hold the land they inhabit."



Let's see what Anonymus writes about Pannonia!
“The land of Pannonia, that had previously been the land of King Attila, and they recommended to them the land of Pannonia as being good beyond measure. For they said that there flowed the most
noble spring waters, the Danube and Tisza and other most noble springs, abounding in good fish, in which land there lived the Slavs, Bulgarians and Blachii, and the shepherds of the Romans. For
after the death of King Attila, the Romans said the land of Pannonia was pastureland because their flocks grazed in the land of Pannonia. And rightly is the land of Pannonia said to be the pastureland
of the Romans, for now too the Romans graze on the goods of Hungary.”
In this case, the Romanians say “Blachii” means also “Romanian”. But as we can see this story is in
Pannonia, even Vienna the Austrian capital is in Pannonia. This story is not in Transylvania, not in the former Dacian area. By the way, does anybody know any Vlachs in Pannonia? Because no
other sources know about any Vlachs or Romanians in Pannonia. Just, of course, the Romanians imagine themself to everywhere, even they refer to that other source “mentions” Romanians in Kyiv.
Anyway we know well the Byzantine sources mention Vlachs in the Balcan and also deep in Greece, in Thessaly. I do not understand if the Romanians were “allegedly in half Europe
everywhere” in the past according to the Romanian propaganda, why no contemporary source knows about the things of the “super ancient” Romanians?
Great Vlachia - Wikipedia
A passing remark by Anna Comnena reveals that nomads of the Balkans were “commonly called
Vlachs” around 1100 (Anna Comnena: The Alexiad (8.3.), p. 252.). Vlach was a common name, not a concrete nation, this fact also proves the immigration theory of the Romanians, the Vlachs



(nomad shepherds) mixed with many folks in the Balcan (Vlachs, Albanians, Slavs, Bulgarians,
Pechenegs, Cumans, Tatars...).
The etymology of the “Vlach” word: Proto-Germanic “Walhaz”, which meant “stranger”. If somebody
is “allegedly super ancient” somewhere then why do the people in the past call them a “stranger”?

By the way in earlier sources, John Malalas (491-578) a Syrian chronicler from Antioch, and Theophanes the Confessor (758-818) a Byzantine chronicler named a Hun King in the Caucasus
as “Blach” and “Balach”. Following the Romanian propaganda logic, the Hun King would be “Romanian” too?

Anonymus mentions the “shepherd of the Romans” in Pannonia. We know Pannonia was a Roman province for almost 400 years, so this thing is not a surprise. According to the chronicle, the Huns
made two battles against the Romans around 374 in Pannonia and washed out the Romans from Pannonia (Battle of Tárnok Valley around today's Budapest and Battle of Zeiselmauer around
today's Vienna). Anonymus writes that the Romans are using the land of Pannonia however, the Roman Empire was collapsed soon after the death of King Attila. The last Roman emperor,
Romulus Augustulus, and the next ruler Odoacer were both the men of Attila. Romulus's father Orestes was a Roman citizen, originally from Pannonia, who had served as a secretary and
diplomat for Attila the Hun. Odoacer was described by Priscus as a Hun. Historians say that Odoacer was born to a Gothic mother and that his father, Edeco, was a Hun. The “Roman” name is
a Joker card for Romanians, peoples of the Roman Empire called “Roman”, Byzantine Empire called “Roman”, even the Germans called his empire “Holy Roman Empire”, the style of the
architecture called “Romanesque”, etc... So the “Roman” word does not mean that everything is “Romanian”. Romania was established only in 1859. The united principalities officially adopted the
name Romania on 21 February 1862. Romania first became a nation in 1859 and would later gain independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878. Before it was called Wallachia and the Romanians
called Vlachs. Anonymus also writes Bulgarians in this section, but we know the Bulgarians occupied the eastern part of the Carpathian Basin, but not in Pannonia.
Anonymus writes:
“Quam terram habitarent Sclavi, Bulgari et Blachii ac pastores Romanorum” = “Blachii, and also the
shepherd of the Romans”
Anonymus made obviously a difference between “Blachii” and “shepherd of the Romans”. However,
the Romanian propaganda says “Blachii” means the “shepherd of the Romans”. By the way, we can see Anonymus writes clearly “Roman” and “Blachii”. If “Blachii” would be “Roman” why Anonymus
made difference between them, or why did he write two names?
“ac” = “and” / “and also” / “and morover” in Latin
Latin Definitions for: ac (Latin Search)



However, at the time when Árpad came to Pannonia, the Romans and Latin speakers were nowhere, only the official Church language was Latin in many places in Europe, and even in Italy,
the average people did not speak the original Latin at that time. The Roman empire was very big, I do not think, in that huge territory everybody was Roman ethnic and Latin speaker. And we know
very well the Romans hired many “barbarian” soldiers (Germans, Huns, Sarmatians...), so if somebody is the “shepherd of the Roman” it could not mean he should be a Roman ethnic or Latin
speaker, and as we can see Anonymus says clearly that the “Blachii” and “shepherds” are different people. Anonymus wrote many pages about the Huns and the Western and the Eastern Roman
Empire. Anonymus as a history writer and as an educated person knows many things about the Romans. So if ”Blasii/Blachii/Blacorum” would be a “Roman” or “Latin speaker”, then Anonymus
would have written this.
The Romanian propaganda says the “shepherd of the Romans” means “Romanians” in Pannonia.
We know well the Franks defeated the Avars and occupied Pannonia around 800. East Francia became the Kingdom of Germany. A Hungarian army was defeated in German land at the Battle of
Lechfeld in 955. Seven years later Otto I was rewarded for stopping the Hungarians and he was crowned Emperor by Pope John XII in 962 and the Holy Roman Empire (962–1806) was
established.
The Gesta Hungarorum was written after 962 when the Holy Roman Empire was ruled by the Germans, reading the chronicle easy to recognize that the Germans in Pannonia were described as
“Romans” at the time of the Hungarian conquest.



Pannonia is far from Transylvania and from today Romania.



According to the accounts of William of Rubruck and Roger Bacon (1219-1292), during the Hun's migration to Europe “also came the Blacs, the Bulgars and the Vandals. For from that Greater
Bulgaria come the Bulgars, who are beyond the Danube near Constantinople. And near the land of Pascatir (Magna Hungaria i.e. somewhere around the Ural Mountains and the Volga River from
where came the Huns) are the Iliac (Blachi from greater Blachia, from which came the Blachi in the land Assani between Constantinople and Bulgaria and lesser Hungary), which is the same word as
Blac but the Tatars do not know how to pronounce (the letter) B, and from them come those who are in the land of Assan (i.e. the Vlachs in the Second Bulgarian Empire). They call both of them
Iliac, the former and the latter”.
William of Rubruck was a missionary and explorer. He is best known for his travels to various parts
of the Middle East and Central Asia in the 13th century, including the Mongol Empire. His account of his travels is one of the masterpieces of medieval geographical literature, comparable to those of
Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta.
Voyage of William of Rubruck in 1253-1255:
A remark by William of Rubruck about the origin of the population called Illac i.e. Vlachs resulted
among historians that the “Blachii/Blasii” of Anonymous, “Blackis” of Simon of Kéza and Villehardouin, “Blaci” of William of Rubruck, Roger Bacon and Johannes Schöner, even of the
Hungarian charters between 1222 and 1224, were not related to the Vlachs, instead there was a difference between Turkic Blac/Blaq and Latin Vlach people.
Bulaqs - Wikipedia
The Opus Majus of Roger Bacon



The cartographers, Johannes Schöner (1523) and Pierre Desceliers (1553) located the Blaci people north of the Caspian Sea. Magna Blacia, Magna Bulgaria, and Magna Hungaria are located
as neighboring Bashkiria, based on missionaries' works from the Middle Ages. The “Blaci” people next to Magna Hungaria depicted on the Johannes Schöner's (1523-24) terrestrial globe, and
Vlachs did not live in Magna Hungaria.
This map created by Tomka-Szászky János in 1750 based on Anonymus work. In this map we can see “Blasii” and “Blachi” in south Transylvania and “Volochi” outside the Carpathian Basin, so the
“Blasii” and “Volochi” are used as a different name, however, Anonymus did not mention any “Volochi” in his work. We can see the Bulgarians in the center of the Carpathian Basin as
Anonymus mention them. The author should know about the Romanians in 1750, so if the Romanians would be the “Blasii” I suppose the author would have been written this, but at that time
nobody thought that this word would mean “Romanian”. We can see also the name of “Gyulae” in Transylvania which is a Hungarian version of the Latin “Gelou” word.



In this map from 1852 above the Black Sea, we can see a “Bulgares ou Wolochs” label. It means: “Bulgars or in another name Volokhi”. So at that time also nobody thought the Volokhi would be the
Romanians.

The Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum (Deeds of the Huns and Hungarians) is a later medieval
Hungarian chronicle written by Simon of Kéza around 1282–1285. We can read only three times the “Blackis” word in this long chronicle without many details. Of course, the Romanians say
“Blackis” means only “Romanian”.
"The story of Attila's victories:
Pannonia, Pamfilia, Macedonia, Dalmatia and the cities of Frigia that are harassed frequently by the
Huns by robberies and occupations, gaining freedom from Attila, they are leaving the land of their birth, they are moving across the Adriatic Sea to Apulia, and the Blackis who are the shepherds and
farmers voluntarily remaining in Pannonia."
This story talks about the time of Attila (5th-century), not the time of Árpad (9th-century), and we
can see in this text the “Blackis” were the shepherd and farmers of the Huns. In the same story, Anonymus wrote “Blachii”. If this word would be similar to Anonymus “Blachii” then we can see the
pronunciation of “ch” is “k” as “Blackis” in the chronicle of Kézai and in this way this word is farther from the “Vlach” word where the pronunciation is “h”. Anyway, this chronicle was written almost 900
years later after the life of Attila, meantime no contemporary sources write about any Vlachs in Pannonia after the time of Attila. We can see this uncertain blurry word regarding Pannonia without
more details and story only in this non-contemporary Hungarian chronicle. If these “Blackis” would be Vlach why did nobody else know about them in Pannonia outside this document?
“These Székelys were the remains of the Huns, who when they learned that the Hungarians had
returned to Pannonia for the second time, went to the returnees on the border of Ruthenia and conquered Pannonia together, but not on the Pannonian plane, they were granted estates in the
mountainous borderlands together with the Blackis, where mingling with the Blackis it is said they used their letters”
According to the chronicle, the “Blackis” got estates in Transylvania with the Székelys and they mixed together at the time of Árpad, and the Székelys are using the letter of the “Blackis”. Based on
the Hungarian chronicle, of course, the Romanian propagandaTM entertainment factory says the Hungarians learned the old Hungarian script from the Romanians, and the old Hungarian script is
“Romanian”. But the Székelys are using the old Hungarian script to this day together with Hungarians and the Romanians did not use the old Hungarian script at all, moreover, the first



Romanian document is the Neacsu's letter from 1521 written in Cyrillic. There is no evidence
Romanians would have been written ever with such letters. Having more phonemes that are missing from the Latin alphabet and the Indo-European languages. The old Hungarian script
matches the Hungarian language and alphabet. According to scholars, the old Hungarian script has a Turkic origin and we can see similar scripts in Asia as well, if the Romanians are allegedly
Romans and Latins, why they would use a Turkic script 800 years after the Roman conquest of Dacia and after the “allegedly proud Latinization”? The Romanian propaganda is very illogical.
Moreover, the majority of Székelys and Romanians have different appearances, language, and genetics, they did not mix and according to the text, Székelys and “Blackis” are mixed already 1100
years ago. Based on this text, I do not understand the “Blackis” how can be Romanians. The “Blackis” in this text are not Vlachs.
The Thuroczy chronicle (1488) writes this about the Székelys regarding the same story:
“They were afraid of the Western nations which they harassed in Attila's life, and they marched to
Transylvania, the frontier of the Pannonian landscape, and they did not call themselves Huns or Hungarians, but Siculus, in their own word Székelys, so that they would not know that they are the
remnants of the Huns or Hungarians. In our time, no one doubts, that the Székelys are the remnants of the Huns who first came to Pannonia, and because their people do not seem to have
been mixed with foreign blood since then, they are also more strict in their morals, they also differ from other Hungarians in the division of lands. They have not yet forgotten the Scythian letters, and
these are not inked on paper, but engraved on sticks skillfully, in the way of the carving. They later grew into not insignificant people, and when the Hungarians came to Pannonia again from Scythia,
they went to Ruthenia in front of them with great joy, as soon as the news of their coming came to them. When the Hungarians took possession of Pannonia again, at the division of the country, with
the consent of the Hungarians, these Székelys were given the part of the country that they had already chosen as their place of residence.”
According to scholars, the Old Hungarian script is a child system of the Old Turkic alphabet. This script also proves the “Blackis” are not Vlachs.
Old Hungarian script - Wikipedia
Could anybody show me the same old “Romanian” script?



“After almost all of Attila’s sons died, together with the Scythian people, in the Crumbelt war, Pannonia went on for a decade without any king: only Slavs, Greeks, Germans, Messianists, and
Vlach newcomers remaining, who in the days of Attila, served him with public service.”
As we can see directly in the previous section, Kézai mentions the “Blackis”. The Romanians dream
they are “everybody” to find desperately some history, the Romanians say the “Blackis” are “Romanians” too not only the “Ulahis”. But it is very clear that the “Blackis” and “Ulahis” are two
different groups in the story, or why Kézai would have used a totally different name instantly one after another? The “Blackis” in this text clearly is not Vlachs.
And this is that the Romanians never mention:
Kézai writes clearly: “et Ulahis advenis”
“advenis” = “newcomer” / “outsider” / “foreigner” / “stranger” / “alien” in Latin
“et Ulahis advenis” = “and Vlach newcomers”
The Kingdom of Hungary has no info about the Vlachs in his territory before the 13-14th century, Kézai wrote his chronicle around this time, so it is clear why he called the Vlachs as newcomer
foreigners.
Kézai writes this story after the death of King Attila the Hun. So this story happens at the time of
Attila in Pannonia and not at that time when the Hungarians conquered back the Carpathian Basin. In other older sources among the listed folk, we know sure about Slavs and Germans in Pannonia
after the Huns. Who are the Messianists? Perhaps Jews? Does anybody else know a big Jewish population in Pannonia after the Huns? Messianism is the belief in a messiah who acts as the
savior of a group of people. Messianism originated as an Abrahamic religious belief, but other religions have messianism-related concepts. Religions with a messiah concept include Judaism
(Mashiach), Christianity (Christ), Islam (Isa Masih), Zoroastrianism (Saoshyant), Buddhism (Maitreya), Hinduism (Kalki), Taoism (Li Hong), and Bábism (He whom God shall make manifest). I



can imagine that some Greeks served Attila, for example, Priscus the Byzantine diplomat who
visited Attila court, meet a Greek merchant who dressed in Scythian clothes and lived among the Huns. Kézai writes his chronicle 900 years later after Attila, so it is not a contemporary source.
Kézai mentions Greeks and Vlachs in Pannonia (and not in Transylvania!) in this section, but no contemporary sources know about any Greeks or Vlachs in Pannonia. So we can suppose Kézai
used the contemporary folks in the 13th century when he described the place. And we know sure German knights, Saxon settlers, Jew merchants, Vlach shepherds have settled in Hungary around
that time. I am wondering if the Greeks know about Greek folks in Pannonia before the Hungarian conquest. We do not have contemporary sources that could confirm the presence of the Greeks or
Vlachs in Pannonia at the time of Attila, so only one document after 900 years of the events is very weak evidence of the presence of Romanians at that time in Pannonia. Moreover, we know from
Byzantine sources that the “Vlach name” was used general for “nomads”. However “Ulahis” does not necessarily refer to Vlachs, but any vulgar-Latin speaking population from the Post-Roman era
or the Celtic origin. “Oláh” means Vlach in Hungarian, “Olasz” means Italian in Hungarian. The Roman Empire was very big, it is impossible that every Latin speaker in such a big territory would
be the ancestor of Romanians. The language and genetics also can be very different. For example, the English speaker Afro-Americans are not originally from England and the Italian are Romanian
genetic is far from each other.
This story mentions Pannonia and not Transylvania. Pannonia in the 4th century:
The Daco-Romanian propaganda tries to connect the Dacians and the Romanians. There is a
massive 1000 years black gap between Dacians and Vlachs, only the Romanian propaganda connects them. Dacia was established in 168 BC and the Roman conquest was in 106 AD,
Emperor Aurelian's withdrawal was in 275. The Roman rule was about 169 years, its a really short time and the situation was always dangerous for the Romans, that is why the Roman Empire
needed to withdraw. So the Dacians and the Romans were not friends.
It is clear from contemporary Roman sources that the Romans exterminated the Dacians. The
Getaes (Dacians) are barbaric and mighty people who rebelled against the Romans and humiliated them so much that they ordered them to pay taxes. Later in the time of King Decebal, Trajan
destroyed them so much that their entire population fell to 40 men as Criton narrates in Getica. Criton was involved in the Second Dacian War as a physician of Emperor Trajan, thus he was a
witness of the extermination of the Dacians.
Britannia (England), Hispania (Spain), Macedonia (and Greece), Gallia (France), Dalmatia,
Pannonia... all of them were stable strong Latinized Roman provinces much longer than Dacia. And today those countries did not say “we are Romans”. Africa (Tunesia), Syria, Egypt, Asia (Turkey),
Mauretania (Algeria)... were Roman provinces much longer than Dacia and they did not say we are “we are Romans”.



Dacia province was a very hostile and unstable province on the edge of the Roman Empire, the
Dacians made a lot of bloody war against the Romans. And finally, the Romans needed to withdraw from Dacia, from the hostile territory. Reports from contemporary eyewitnesses attest that Romans
abandoned Dacia in a great hurry because of the attacks of the Goths and mainly because of the raids carried on by the Yazyg, who are said to have made thousands of Roman prisoners and
caused enormous devastations.
A new Dacia province was established south of the Danube after the Roman withdrawal. The
Illyricum and the Balcan were much longer time under Roman rule. The Romanian language has a Latin impact, for this Latinization needed a long time and stable background, which was clearly not
in the former Dacian territory, and not in Transylvania.
Diocese of Dacia - Wikipedia
The new Dacia was located in today Serbia/Montenegro/Albania:
Not even Jordanes did mention any Romans or Romanized inhabitants in Dacia. Jordanes wrote in
the 6th century (Getica, XII, 73-74.):
“I mean ancient Dacia, which the race of the Gepids now possess. This Gothia, which our
ancestors called Dacia and now, as I have said, is called Gepidia, was then bounded on the east by the Roxolani, on the west by the Yazyg, on the north by the Sarmatians and Basternae and on the
south by the river Danube. The Yazyg are separated from the Roxolani by the Aluta river only”

Europe following the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476:
The German tribes, Huns, Slavs, Avars, Bulgarians washed out total the Romans or the Romanized locals from the area and the Slavs absorbed the remaining Illyrians and Balcan folks. During the 5th
century, the last de jure Western Roman Emperor Julius Nepos ruled his small realm from the palace after fleeing Italy to go into exile in 475.
Finally, the new Dacia was devastated by Slavs and Avars around 600:



The Italian and Romanian genetics is different, if the Romanians would be Romans why do the
Romanians have Balcanian genetics?



Constantine VII Flavius Porphyrogenitus (17 May 905 – 9 November 959) was a Byzantine Emperor (Reign: from 6 June 913 to 9 November 959). De Administrando Imperio ("On the
Governance of the Empire") is the Latin title of a Greek-language work written by the 10th century Eastern Roman Emperor Constantine VII.

A map created based on the Emperor's work in Paris by a French cartographer: (Guillaume Delisle,
1715)



I can see “Turcia”, inside “Abares” (Avars), Moravia (Moravia used a 50 years gap after the Franks and the Bulgars destroyed the Avar state). The contemporary Byzantine sources say Avars = Turks,
Avars = Scythians, Hungarians = Turks, Hungarians = Scythians, King Attila = Scythian (Priscus), King Attila = Avar (Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus). The contemporary Byzantian sources
called the Hungarians as “Turks”, because the religious cult, social structure, appearance was not different than the other Turk peoples at that time.
I can see this detailed map which is based on the contemporary work of the Byzantine Emperor and I do not see any Vlachs or Romanians. I think the Romanians could consult with the Emperor why
he forgot to mention the “always majority Romanians”. I think the Romanians cannot blame the Emperor because we also do not have any other contemporary sources that mention any Vlachs in
the Carpathian Basin at that time. I see the medieval Byzantine authors know very precisely the day when the Emperor was born and died, we could suggest they did precise works. This is also a very
important state and strategy document, and we can see many details, many nations. In this map, we cannot see any Vlachs or Latins in the area of the former Dacia province (which is ceased 700
years before the time of Constantine VII), and this area is very close to the Byzantine Empire, but I see the mighty Byzantine Emperor knows many far countries like Franks, Russia, Caucasus, Syria,
Persia, etc. It would be strange if there would have been any Dacian or Vlach population near to his empire, and he would have not known this, moreover the Romanian propaganda talks all the time
“always majority Romanians” in that region. Why did nobody know about this “huge Romanian population”?
Anonymus wrote the Gesta Hungarorum around the 11-12th century after 150-300 years of the events, thus Anonymus is not a contemporary source. He writes about many characters, but no
other sources know many of them. So the majority of historians say these enemies of Hungarians are fictional characters. Of course, the Romanian propaganda converts three characters to
Romanian persons. Of course, many Romanians call them “Romanian kings”, by the way where is their “kingdom”? Does anybody know about these “Romanian kings”?
Menumarot, Glad, Gelou also has statues in Romania, “the three Romanian kings”.



According to the Gesta, Menumorut communicated “haughtily with a Bulgarian heart” with the Hungarians' envoys, informing them that “the emperor of Constantinople” was his lord. According to
Anonymus, Menumorut's duchy was populated with Khazars and Székelys.



If I read the Hungarian chronicle I really do not understand Menumorut how can be “Romanian”. In the story of Menumorut, I do not see even at all any “Blacorum” word, but he had a Bulgarian heart,



despite the Romanian historians are saying he is “Romanian”. How can be anybody Romanian with
a Bulgarian heart? The Romanians do not have much history so I can understand, they need to desperately make history. Romania got that land from the Entente in 1920 where Menumorut ruled,
and the Romanians imagine themself 1100 years earlier to justify the country's theft. The Romanians are referring to the Hungarian chronicles to prove their existence like they convert
Menumorut to Romanian, but as we can see this is very weak evidence. Is this the “super ancient” Romanian history?
History-making is at a high level in Romania:
Glad is also unknown from other primary sources of the Hungarian Conquest. Therefore, modern historians debate whether Glad was an actual enemy of the conquerors or only a “fictitious person”.
According to the Gesta Hungarorum, Glad came from Vidin in Bulgaria. He occupied Banat with the assistance of Cumans before the arrival of the Hungarians. Anonymus wrote that Cumans,
Bulgarians, and “Blacorum”, supported Glad against the invading Hungarians, it stated that Glad commanded “a great army of horsemen”. But we know very well the horsemen were steppe
warriors, not the Vlachs. Anonymus wrote two dukes of the Cumans and three princes of the Bulgarians were slain in that battle, and Glad was their duke. Anonymus's reference to the Cumans
is one of the key points in the scholarly debate because the Cumans did not arrive in Europe before the 1050s. Historians identify the “Cumans”, as Pechenegs, Avars or Kabars saying that the
Hungarian word that Anonymus translated as “Cuman” originally dubbed any Turkic tribe. Shortly after the victory of the Hungarians, Glad received allegiance and then served as a military
commander subordinate to the Hungarians. According to historians, Glad would not have been left as a leader by the Hungarians if he had not come from a related tribe. Among the Maros, Tisza, and
Danube rivers, several toponyms preserve its memory. Historians also say probably Anonymus named their character after the local place names. If I see this info still I do not understand Glad
how can be Romanian.



We can read about Gelou in the Gesta Hungarorum. The Romanians say “Blacorum/Blacus” means Romanian.
Gelou is also unknown from other primary sources of the Hungarian Conquest. The other sources
(Byzantine, Bulgarian, Slav, German... do not know about Gelou). Consequently, historians debate whether Gelou was a historical person or an imaginary figure created many hundred years after the
events by the author of the Gesta Hungarorum. The Romanian historians imagine a Romanian person behind this character, which is understandable because the Romanians want to desperately
imagine themself in Transylvania before the Hungarians to justify why Romania who established only in 1859 got a huge 1000 years Hungarian land in 1920 from the Kingdom of Hungary. But I
suppose if somebody is “allegedly super ancient” somewhere then we should have much more historical sources about him, and not only some uncertain blurry words, not only a chronicle from
another nation that was written many hundred years later.
The Romanian archaeologists made every possible effort to prove that the Gesta was a reliable
source for the medieval history of “Romanian Transylvania”, during the excavations at Doboka (Gelou's assumed seat) between the late 1960s and 1980s, but they were embarrassed that no
substantial evidence was found to prove the Gesta right.
The ethnicity mentioned in connection with Gelou was not Romanian, Dacian, or Vlach, but Blac,
and this could mean the Bulaqs - Wikipedia people, who could arrive in Europe already with Huns. When Simon of Kéza wanted to write about Romance-speaking people, he used the word
“Ulahis” and used a different name “Blackis” for the Turkic ethnicity, which gave the writing system to Székely people.



I see sometimes Romanians say “in Greek and Slavic “v” is written “b”, so the Blach means Vlach”.
But Anonymus wrote in Latin, not in Greek, not in Slavic and the original text is “Blacorum” and “Blasii”.
Greek alphabet - Wikipedia
Greek: Β β (beta) = Ancient pronunciation “b” as in English “better”, Modern pronunciation “v” as in
English “vote”. (so only the modern is “v”, thus “B” is “beta” not “veta”)
Anyway, Anonymus wrote “B” in Latin, and the full chronicle is Latin, and nobody writes only one
alphabet in Greek and the other part of the word in Latin, this is nonsense and ridiculous.
Gelou name is a pure Hungarian word just in Latin form. There was no academic spelling dictionary at that time so writing Hungarian names with Latin alphabets was not so easy, that is why
Anonymus writes all Hungarian names in many variations in the same book. The Hungarian language uses 44 alphabets while the Latin uses only 23 alphabets.
We can see there is many spelling in Gesta Hungarorum in the same document and much more variants in other sources.
Transylvanian ruler in Gesta in Latin: Gelu, Gelou, Geloum, Geleou (Hungarian: Gyalu)
Hungarian ruler in Gesta in Latin: Geulam, Geula (Hungarian: Gyula)
Hungarian city in Gesta in Latin: Geuru (Hungarian: Győr)
Another example, Anonymus writes “Tuhutum”, and in modern Hungarian we say: “Töhötöm /
Tétény”
Also, Gyula means a title, not a personal name. We can see every author spell differently, but it is
similar.
Gyula (title) - Wikipedia
Gyula (Yula, Gula, Gila) was, according to Muslim and Byzantine sources, the title of one of the leaders, the second in rank, of the Hungarian tribal federation in the 9th–10th centuries. In the
earliest Hungarian sources, the title name is only recorded as a personal name (Gyyla, Geula,



Gyla, Iula). According to the Hungarian chronicles, Transylvania was ruled by a line of Hungarian
princes called Gyula, and their country was occupied by King Stephen I of Hungary.
We know also many things about them in Byzantine sources too. Gyula II was a Hungarian tribal
leader in the middle of the 10th century around 950. He visited Constantinople, where he was baptized. Gyula III was the son of Gyula II who ruled in Transylvania around 980 - 1003. Sarolt was
the sister of Gyula and she was the mother of King Stephen. Around 1003, he and his family were attacked, dispossessed and captured by King Stephen I of Hungary.
Gyula - Wikipedia
Gyula II - Wikipedia
Gyula III - Wikipedia
Finally, we can see there are many spellings in various documents: Gyula = “Geula / Geulam / Yula
/ Gula / Gila / Gyyla / Gyla / Iula...” it is not so hard to imagine that the Transylvanian “Gelu, Gelou, Geloum, Geleou” is the same title.
The contemporary Byzantine sources usually called the Avars and Hungarians as Turks. According to contemporary sources and archeology, the Avar population was present when the relative
Hungarian tribes arrived, moreover many foreign contemporary high-ranked authors write Huns = Avars = Hungarians. We also know many sources about also the Hun relative Bulgarians at that
time. It is not so hard to imagine this Geolu could be a local Avar or Bulgarian leader. Of course, the Romanians never mention the Avars.

Where are the Romanian cemeteries? Where are the cemeteries of the “allegedly always majority
large Romanian population”?
John Skylitzes was a Byzantine historian in the 11th century, he narrates that around 952 Gyula
visited Constantinople, where he was baptized, and Emperor Constantine VII lifted him from the baptismal font. He also received the honorary title patrikios in Constantinople. Gyula was given a
bishop named Hierotheos who accompanied him back to Turkia (Hungary), where he converted many Hungarians to the Christian faith. Gyula built the earliest Christian church of Transylvania
around 950 in Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia), this was built for the Byzantine rite (of course we are before the Great Schism of 1054 at this time), the ruins of this church was found in 2011. The
present Catholic cathedral was built in the 12th or 13th century.
Constantine VII Flavius Porphyrogenitus - De Administrando Imperio
“to de thema tou kato Gyla plesiadzei te Tourkia”
“The province of Lower Gyla neighbors Turkia [Hungary]”
De Administrando Imperio was written by the 10th-century Eastern Roman Emperor Constantine
VII. It is a contemporary work. Transylvania is called Lower Gyla, because Gyula the Hungarian tribal leader ruled that region at that time. This fact proves again that Anonymus created persons
from toponyms.

The Gyulas in Alliance with Byzantium
Gyulafehérvár was the capital of Transylvania and the Gyula, the Hungarian leader governed
Transylvania from this city. This is the St. Michael's Cathedral in Gyulafehérvár. The diocese of Gyulafehérvár was founded by Stephen I of Hungary in 1009. The Romanian name of the city is
Alba Iulia (alba = white in Latin, Iulia = Gyula). Gyula + fehér + vár = Gyula + white + castle. The Latin name of the city in Roman times was Apulum, but the allegedly “super ancient” Romanians
forgot the Latin name and translated it from the Hungarian one. Usually, the newcomers adapt the old place names, and almost every Romanian place name in Transylvania comes from the
Hungarian one.



Some other Hungarian settlements were named Gyula. It would be very unlikely that the Hungarians called many cities from an enemy person. Moreover, many of them are very far from
Transylvania.
Gyalu settlement is near to Kolozsvár (Cluj Napoca). In the Kingdom of Hungary, in Transylvania,
there are many settlements that were named after old Hungarian persons or leaders, for example in Kolozs county there are many around Gyalu: Kolozsvár, Torda, Dézs, Doboka, Ajton, Koppánd...
Transylvanian ruler: Gelu, Gelou, Geloum, Geleou (Hungarian: Gyalu)



This is the Gyalu/Gilau Mountains in Transylvania. Hungarian: Gyalui havasok, Romanian: Munții
Gilăului.
Historians think that Anonymus invented all the opponents of the Hungarians and they are just
fictional characters because contemporary sources do not know about them. According to this view, Anonymus named persons for a river, hill, or settlement. According to this theory, Gelou is an
imaginary figure named by Anonymus, and Gelou was named after Gyalu, a Transylvanian village or after the Gyalu Mountains in where Gelou dies in the Gesta. It is very unusual to name a
mountain after a person, we have to assume that the reverse happened.
Gyula is a very popular male name in Hungary.
Gyula (name) - Wikipedia
Gyula is an old Hungarian male personal name, which is derived from the dignified name gyula of
Turkish origin, which is derived from the Turkish word jula (torch). In the age of conquest, the second dignity of the country was so named. The name was erroneously but deliberately identified
with the Latin name Julius as early as 1795. Thus the female equivalent of the name was Julia. That is why Romanian renamed Gyulafehérvár to Alba Julia.
“gyullad” = to ignite in Hungarian
Gelou does not mean anything in Romanian.



Even a famous Hungarian sausage and brand name is Gyulai.
Gyula is very a commonly given name in Hungary. Gelu is a forename in Romania, But as I listed
above Gyula has more things in Hungarian, and in Romanian this is just a forename.
For example, “John” has many variations in many languages:
Alternate forms for the name John - Wikipedia
John in English, János in Hungarian, Ioan in Romanian. But this does not mean the English John or
the Hungarian János came from the Romanian, because John has a Semitic origin. Regarding Gelou, if the Romanians rename or take a Hungarian name from a Hungarian chronicle, this person
will be not a Romanian.
I see some Romanians say that duke Salan was also Romanian. Salan is a local Bulgarian duke
who ruled in the 9th century between Danube and Tisza rivers according to the Gesta Hungarorum. The chronicle states that he was a descendant of the Bulgarian Khan who conquered the territory
up to the borders of Russia and Poland after the death of Attila the Hun. At the time of the Hungarian conquest, Hungarians attacked Salan's voivodship, and Bulgarians led by the tsar
Simeon came to the aid of voivod Salan and even the Byzantine Emperor sent auxiliary troops against the Hungarians. The chronicle writes this info about Salan, even the land of Salan is in the
middle of today Hungary, but these things are not a problem for Romanians who say Salan was “Romanian”, because these Romanians had a desperate vision that full today Hungary is also a
“Romanian land” and a “large Romanian population” lived in today Hungary, even in Pannonia at that time, despite no any contemporary source know about any Romanians at that time in the
Carpathian Basin.
The Romanian propaganda says “large Christian and always majority Romanian population” lived in
Transylvania, if this would be true why did the Hungarians bring priests from Constantinople, from Rome, from the German lands? And later in the 13th century, why did the Pope ask the Hungarian
king to convert the Cumans in the territory of future Wallachia to the Christian faith, why he did not ask the “Romanians”?
