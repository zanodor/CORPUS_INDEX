Apasmāra (अपस्मार ) is part of the Naṭarāja sculpture found at the temple of
Lokeśvara.—Apasmāra is clad with a dhotī with kacce clearly traceable. His face is to the left of Śiva, lifted up, and he has a small horn. He has one necklace. He holds something in his hand, which may be a broom (?). As per the description of Apasmāra in Kālikākhaṇḍa of Skandapurāṇa, he should be black in color, have three heads and three eyes, six protruding canine teeth, three legs and six hands.

Contribution of Indus Script Cipher to cognitive neuroscience
https://tinyurl.com/zm6yv6ph
paśyantī stage of vāc speech -- seen sounds and heard hieroglyphs is a contribution to further advance cognitive neuroscience studies. In paśyantī stage, rebus hieroglyph (or, word associated with the image') of Indus Script Corpora, is 'seen sound'.
This association or synthesis is sphoṭa 'bursting forth' of śabdārtha, 'meaning of word.'
Of the four stages of speech, three stages remain concealed and motionless. Mortals know only the fourth. This is noted by Dīrghatamas in R̥gveda 1.164.45
Griffith translation RV 1.164.45: Speech hath been measured out in four divisions, the Brahmans who have understanding know them. Three kept in close concealment cause no motion; of speech, men speak only the fourth division.

The paśyantī stage of formation of śabdārtha 'meaning of word' involves two types of 'visualisation or abstractions of neural networks in the brain': the two types involve both vision and audition in brain functions of neurons. Thus, seeing sounds and hearing hieroglyphs result in synthesis which gets registered as a synapse, a link between two sensations: seeing, hearing.Thus, when a one-horned youngbull is seen on a seal impression, the seen sound and heard image (colour) constitute paśyantī stage and get synthesised in the next madhyamā stage of synapse formation or recall to result in articulated vāc 'speech'.
An example of 'seen sound' is the following Mohenjo-daro pectoral.The seen sound is: khōṇḍa 'young bull'. The heard hieroglyph is: kundaṇa 'pure gold'. This is rebus 'visualization of śabd sound'. The synthesis in the brain results in artha, 'meaning'

m1656. Mohenjo-daro pectoral with two streams of water flowing out
of pot. Hieroglyphs: overflowing pot, young bull, standard device.
I suggest that the seen sound is: खोंड (p. 122) khōṇḍa m 'A young bull, a
bullcalf' (Marathi). The heard image is: Ka. kundaṇa setting a precious stone in fine gold; fine gold; kundana fine gold. Tu. kundaṇa pure gold. Te. kundanamu fine gold used in very thin foils in setting precious stones; setting precious stones with fine gold.(DEDR 1725)
śabdārtha composed of seen sound and heard image emerges in the paśyantī stage of 'meaning formation'. This is a realization that the śabda in the paśyantī stage yields a correlate of the seen sound which is kundaṇa 'pure gold'. The meaning of the hypertext of the Mohenjo-daro pectoral is realized as signifier of 'fine gold'.

Simultaneous processing can also be postulated for the other images of the Mohenjo-daro pectoral: overflowing pot, lathe PLUS portable furnace as standard: lokhaṇḍa 'overflowing pot' rebus: lokhaṇḍa 'metal implements' kamaṭa 'portable furnace' rebus: kammaṭa 'mint, coiner, coinage' PLUS kunda 'lathe' rebus: kundana 'fine gold' -- a phonetic determinant, a semantic reinforcer. These rebus identifications constitute the next stage madhyamā which is the formulation of śabdārtha 'meaning of word' and hypertext significance, that is, vākyārtha 'meaning of sentence, message'. This is the speech form which finds expression in the vaikharī 'articulation' stage. I suggest that the stages of the formation of Meluhha vāc 'speech' constitute Indus Script Cipher. Such 'visualisations' of hieroglyphs as images -- seen sounds and heard forms (colours or images) -- result in the orthography of composite animals of the type described as 'hypertexts' by Dennys Frenez and Massimo Vidale.

Figure 1. Left: The original model from Wernicke, 1874. For unknown reasons, the model is represented on the right hemisphere. Right: An update of the Classic model from Geschwind, 1972. In this figure, according to most anatomical definitions, the superior temporal gyrus is inadvertantly mislabeled as the angular gyrus
“We demonstrate that there is no consistent anatomical definition of “Broca’s and Wernicke’s Areas”, and propose to replace these terms with more precise anatomical definitions. We illustrate the distributed nature of the language connectome, which extends far beyond the single-pathway notion of arcuate fasciculus connectivity established in the Geschwind’s version of the Classic Model. By illustrating the definitional confusion surrounding “Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas”, and the by illustrating the difficulty integrating the emerging literature on perisylvian white matter connectivity into this model, we hope to expose the limits of the model, argue for its obsolescence, and suggest a path forward in defining a replacement. “ – Pascale Tremblay and Anthrony Steven Dick

Left medial and lateral views are on the left. The temporal brain score chart (bottom) conveys changes in brain activity related to task over time. For each LV, mean brain scores (summed scores of activity across the entire brain of each participants and averaged across participants) show the divergence between experimental and control conditions over time (eight 2-sec TRs), and are analogous to hemodynamic response functions typically plotted for individual brain regions. https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article/22/6/1112/4876/Patternsof-Brain-Activity-Supporting

...autobiographical remembering and prospection engaged midline DMN structures to a greater degree and theory-of-mind reasoning engaged lateral DMN areas. A functional connectivity analysis revealed that activity of a critical node in the DMN, medial prefrontal cortex, was correlated with activity in other regions in the DMN during all three tasks. We conclude that the DMN supports common aspects of these cognitive behaviors involved in simulating an internalized experience.

Sphoṭa (स्फोट ) -- Seeing Sounds and Hearing Colors: An Event-related Potential Study of Auditory
Visual Synesthesia
Aviva I. Goller, Leun J. Otten and Jamie Ward Full text: http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/jocn.2009.21134
Posted Online August 21, 2009 Journal of Cognitive NeuroscienceVolume 21 | Issue 10 | October 2009 p.1869-1881
In auditory–visual synesthesia, sounds automatically elicit conscious and reliable visual experiences. It is presently unknown whether this reflects early or late processes in the brain... The results suggest that differences between synesthetes and others occur early in time, and that synesthesia is qualitatively different from similar effects found in infants and certain auditoryinduced visual illusions in adults. In addition, we report two novel cases of synesthesia in which colors elicit sounds, and vice versa.

Sphoṭa (स्फोट ) (Cf. Nāda) refers to the “manifestor” (of the universe) symbolizing Sound
(Nāda), according to Kṣemarāja in his commentaries on the Netratantra and the Svacchandabhairavatantra, which is well known to the Kubjikā Tantras.—‘Sound’ (nāda) is the name given to the pulse (spanda) of the supreme level of Speech (parā vāc), which animates the highest reality. [...] As this Sound is the denotator of the world of objects, which are its denoted meaning, it manifests (sphuṭati) the universe, and so is called the ‘manifestor’ (sphoṭa). As such it is the aggregate of phonemic energies (śabdagrāma) that generates the universe identified with the Sound Absolute (śabdabrahman)—the absolute reality in the form of sound (dhvanirūpa, śabdanasvabhāva). Viewed from the reverse perspective, Sound is the resonance that follows the Point that condenses the energy of mantra, which, through Sound, merges into Śiva’s energy. Accordingly, it is defined as that which remains of the synthetic awareness of the conscious subject in itself when the duality of thought comes to an end. [...]”.—Manthanabhairavatantram

Comparative analysis of commentaries and excerpts in English:
[Nine-fold Nāda]
Ambā in the form of the word sounded or heard further manifests through the three stages,
1. Dhāma (lips, teeth, palate etc;), 2. Karaṇa (open or closed) and 3. Prayatna (light touch, full touch) etc. It may be melodious or harsh.
The same in its unsounded or unheard state becomes mental and shines in five forms
1. Vimarśa, 2. Bindu, 3. Nāda, 4. Sphoṭa and 5. Śabda.
The form of Ambā constitute both in the undivided form of her.
These five and [the following four different kinds of Vāk form the Nāda-navaka:[1]

5. Śabda.
The sound vibration (beaten) takes the four forms
6. Parā,

Praise of Manthāna Bhairava, Rudra
Author praises Rudra, who was in union with Śakti prior to creation, who acting as the churning rod, churns the luminous ocean of truth in his Prakāśa aspect, with the help of His Śakti (Vimarśa) forming the churning chord Pāśa) and brings out nectar-like digits of the moon to please her in her creative play. The outcome of this Amṛtātmika vidya is the Akṣa mātṛka resulting in the universal emanation of names and forms representing the union of Prakāśa and Vimarśa aspects of the Absolute -- amṛtādi pūrṇāmṛtāntāḥ ṣoḍaśasomakalāḥ tantroktāḥ |
The life force in the form of Sudhā (nector) is the Amṛtātmikā Jīvā Śakti.
Her kalā is Vidyā. Candra (Soma) is Sudhākalā: His abode is Śakti. Rudra is meditating Agnikalā. The union of the Soma and Rudra results in Sūryakalā. These three (Candra, Sūrya and Agni) form the eyes of Śiva and Śakti.
In meditative state the Sādhaka while raising himself to the state of Manthāna Bhairava (Bhairava that churns i.e. dissolves all objects into Self-consciousness) feels the flow of nectar after reaching
the Soma kuṇḍalinī level, when his Kuṇḍalinī Śakti unites Śiva in Sahasrāra. The Kuṇḍalinī Śakti of the Sādhaka is divided into three states viz., Agni kuṇḍalinī, Sūrya kuṇḍalinī and Soma kuṇḍalinī.

sound which is produced and heard and which is merely instrumental in the manifestation of an internal voice
which is called Sphota. स्फ त टयेर्नेन अुर्ः इशर् स्फोटः (sphuṭayatenena arthaḥ iti sphoṭaḥ) or स्फोटः िब्दो ध्वशनस्र् स्य व्यायमा -दतपजायेर्
(sphoṭaḥ śabdo dhvanistasya vyāyamā-dupajāyate) Vakyapadiya; cf. also अशि-व्यक्तवादको मध्यमावस्र् आदर्रः िब्दः (abhi
vyaktavādako madhyamāvastha āntaraḥ śabdaḥ) Kaiyata's Pradipa. For, details see Vakyapadiya I and
Sabdakaustubha Ahnika 1. It is doubtful whether this Sphota theory was. advocated before Panini. The
word स्फोटायन (sphoṭāyana) has been put by Panini in the rule अवङ् स्फोटायनस्य (avaṅ sphoṭāyanasya) only incidentally
and, in fact, nothing can be definitely deduced from it although Haradatta says that स्फोटायन (sphoṭāyana) was the
originator of the स्फोटवाद (sphoṭavāda). The word स्फोट (sphoṭa) is not actually found in the Pratisakhya works.
However, commentators on the Pratisakhya works have introduced it in their explanations of the texts which
describe वणोत्पशत्त (varṇotpatti) or production of sound; cf. com. on R.Pr.XIII.4, T.Pr. II.1.

Grammarians have given various kinds of sphota; cf. स्फोटो शिधा । व्यशक्तस्फोटो जाशर्स्फोटश्च। व्यशक्त -स्पोटः सखण्ड अखण्डश्च । सखण्ड। वणुपदवाकय -िेदेन शत्रधा।
अखण्डः पदवाकयिेदेन शिधा । एव ां पञ्च व्यशक्तस्फोटाः। जाशर्स्फोटः वणु -पदवाकयिेदेन शत्रधा। इत्येवमष्टौ स्फोटः त्रर् अखण्डवाकयस्फोट एव मख्तय इशर् नव्याः । वाकय जाशर्स्फोट इशर् र् त प्रा ञ्चः॥

his Mahābhāṣya, Patañjali (2nd century BCE) uses the term sphoṭa to denote the sound of language, the universal, while the actual sound (dhvani) may be long or short, or vary in other ways. This distinction may be thought to be similar to that of the present notion of phoneme. Bhatrihari however, applies the term sphoṭa to each element of the utterance, varṇa the letter or syllable, pada the word, and vākya the sentence. In order to create the linguistic invariant, he argues that these must be treated as separate wholes (varṇasphoṭa, padasphoṭa and vākyasphoṭa respectively). For example, the same speech sound or varṇa may have different properties in different word contexts (e.g. assimilation), so that the sound cannot be discerned until the whole word is heard. The theory of sphota in Patanjali’ Mahabhasya: “shota is thee abstract sound-image which disregards the furtive elements in the phonetic faturs of sounds. (pp.18-19).” “sphota is a class of sounds related to the individual instances of sounds through a relation of the manifest and the manifested and it represents the constant distinctive phonetic features which are sorted and extracted from the gross spoken soundmatter.”(p.47). Thus, sphota compare with modern concepts of phoneme and phonemic pattern.

Caitanya (चैर्दय ):—Consciousness: character of self –Manthānabhairavatantra, worship of
Kubjikā. “Consciousness (caitanya) is said to be (of three kinds) gross, very subtle and Unstruck Sound. The Body made of these principles is the differentiated (aspect) whose form is the ghost (which is the goddess’s vehicle). Complete and made of the six parts, it is sustained by Pure Knowledge. Above it is the measure (called) Sound, which is just a straight (line). [...]”. Note: The threefold consciousness (caitanya) is also mentioned as that of the Self (ātman), Power (śakti) and Śiva. The threefold consciousness abides in a state of invariable union.(Cf. Hamsa —‘seed-syllable’)
Caitanya (चैर्दय ) refers to the Vidyā associated with Nāda, one of the eight Sacred Seats (pīṭha), according to the
Yogakhaṇḍa (chapter 14) of the Manthānabhairavatantra. Consciousness, feeling, sensation, sense; U.1.48. ātman [Old Germ. ātum; Angl.Sax. oedhm; Mod. Germ. Athem, Odem; Gk. ἀϋτμήν, ἀτμός (?).]
