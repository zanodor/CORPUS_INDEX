Indus Script hypertexts and Egyptian hieroglyphs and compared
“The Indus inscriptions resemble the Egyptian hieroglyphs far more than they do the Sumerian
linear and cuneiform system. And secondly, the presence of detached accents in the Indus Script
is a feature which distinguishes it from any of these systems.”( John Marshall, 1931, Mohenjo
daro and the Indus civilization: being an official account of archaeological excavations at Mohenjo-Daro carried out by the government of India between the years 1922 and 1927,
Volume 1, p.424) Flinders Petrie noted the pictographic quality of some Indus signs, on the model of Egyptian hieroglyphs and went on to suggest that the seals belonged to officials and contained their titles, with intimations of administrative functions.
These two insights of John Marshall and Flinders Petrie are validated as the following comparisons of Egyptian hieroglyphs and Indus Script hypertexts demonstrate.
An example of Egyptian hieroglyphs is provided by the cartouche to signify the name of an emperor.
The form and function of Egyptian hieroglyphs are explained by the following example of hieroglyphs on a palette.
On one side of this palette, Narmer is depicted wearing the war crown of Upper Egypt and the red wicker crown of Lower Egypt which signifies that Lower Egypt fell to him. On another side, two hieroglyphs, top-down, show 'cuttle fish' PLUS 'awl'. The copic words to signify these hieroglyphs are: N'r PLUS M'r. Together, the hieroglyphs combine to yield the name of the King: Nar-Mer.
The form and function of Indus Script hypertexts follow a similar rebus equivalence to signify the message.

m1429C One side of a prism tablet hieroglyphs of hypertext signified are: ayo 'fish' (Mu.); rebus: aya '(alloyed) metal' (R̥ gveda); aya 'iron' (Gujarati) kāru a wild crocodile rebus: khār 'blacksmith'. together, the word ayakhār signifies 'iron-blacksmith'.
The hieroglyph noted by Flinders Petrie as a signifier of agent of wakil is: rim-of-jar.
Daimabad seal.
The hypertext reading is: kanka, karṇaka कणर्क [p= 257,2] m. (ifc. f(आ).) a prominence or handle or projection on the side or sides (of a vessel &c ) (Monier-Williams) rebus: karṇika कणर्क [p= 257,2] m. a steersman W.; karṇī 'supercargo, i.e., a representative of the ship's owner on board a merchant ship, responsible for overseeing the cargo and its
sale.' కరణము (p. 250) karaṇamu karaṇamu. [Skt.] n. A village clerk, a writer, an accountant.
వాడు కూత కరణమునిగా వ్రవాతకరణముకాడు he has talents for speaking but not for writing. స్థలకకరణము the registrar of a district. కరణము (p. 250) karaṇamu karaṇamu. [Skt.] n. A
village clerk, a writer, an accountant. వాడు కూత కరణమునిగా వ్రవాతకరణముకాడు he has
talents for speaking but not for writing. స్థలకకరణము the registrar of a district. (Telugu).

Using the examples cited by Flinders Petrie, some hypertexts including this hieroglyph can be read:
See: A tribute to Flinders Petrie. Indus Script inscriptions are accounting records of metalwork of Tin-Bronze Revolution, 4th millennium BCE https://tinyurl.com/y8umxbmz
karaṇaka 'accountant' kolmo 'rice plant' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge' ranku 'liquid measure' rebus: ranku 'tin'. Thus, the message is: accountant (scribe) of smithy/forge (working with) tin.
karaṇaka 'accountant' dula 'two' rebus: dul 'metal casting' khaṇḍa 'division'
rebus: kaṇḍa 'implements'. Thus, the message is accountant (scribe) of cast metal implements.
Note: The inset of three short linear strokes in the rim of jar hieroglyph yields a component of hypertext: kolom 'three' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge'. Thus, the hypertext in this composite hieroglyph signifies accountant (scribe) of smithy/forge.
Thus, while the Egyptian hieroglyphs use the rebus method to derive rebus 'phonemes', the Indus Script hypertexts use the rebus words signified by hieroglyph components of the hypertexts.
The principle of forming hypertexts by combining hieroglyphs is extended not only to 'signs' of the script but also to 'pictorial motifs' as demonstrated by the crocodile PLUS fish and the following composite animal.
Hieroglyph components identified by Dennys Frenez.
The remarkable distinguishing feature of Indus Script hypertexts is that they signify account ledgers of wealth-producing metalwork by artisans of the Sarasvati_Sindhu civilization, who were Meluhha speakers which is the spoken, vernacular version of Proto-Indo-Aryan, Prakrtam
or Pali words or word forms of languages of Bhāratīya sprachbund (speech union), ancient
spoken forms of present-day Bhāratīya languages.
