Anuket
Anuket was the ancient Egyptian goddess of the cataracts of the
Nile and Lower Nubia in general, worshipped especially at
Elephantine near the First Cataract.[1]
Name
In Ancient Egyptian,
she was known as
Anuket, Anaka,[2] or
Anqet.[3] Her name
meant the "Clasper"
or "Embracer".[2] In
Greek, this became
Anoukis (Ανουκις),[2]
sometimes also
spelled Anukis.[4] In
the interpretatio
graeca, she was
considered
equivalent to Hestia
or Vesta.[2]
Depictions
Anuket was usually
depicted as a woman
with a headdress of
either reed or ostrich
feathers[5] She was
usually depicted as
holding a Sceptre



Symbol Bow, arrows, gazelle,
ostrich feather
Parents Khnum and Satet
topped with an ankh,
and her sacred
animal was the
gazelle.[6] She was
also shown suckling the Pharaoh through the New Kingdom and
became a goddess of lust in later years.[6] In later periods, she was
associated with the cowry, especially the shell, which resembled the
vagina.[6]
History and roles
She was originally the daughter of Ra, but was always related to
Satet in some way. For example, both goddesses were called the
"Eye of Ra", along with Bastet, Hathor, and Sekhmet.[6] Also, they
were both related in some way to the Uraeus.[6]
Worship
Anuket was part of a triad with the god Khnum, and the goddess
Satis. She may have been the sister of the goddess Satis[5] or she
may have been a junior consort to Khnum instead.[5][2]
A temple dedicated to Anuket was erected on the Island of Seheil.
Inscriptions show that a shrine or altar was dedicated to her at this
site by the 13th dynasty Pharaoh Sobekhotep III. Much later, during
the 18th dynasty, Amenhotep II dedicated a chapel to the goddess.[7]
During the New Kingdom, Anuket's cult at Elephantine included a
river procession of the goddess during the first month of Shemu.
Inscriptions mention the processional festival of Khnum and Anuket
during this time period.[8]
Ceremonially, when the Nile started its annual flood, the Festival of
Anuket began. People threw coins, gold, jewelry, and precious gifts



into the river, in thanks for the life-giving water and returning
benefits derived from the wealth provided by her fertility to the
goddess. The taboo held in several parts of Egypt, against eating
certain fish which were considered sacred, was lifted during this
time, suggesting that a fish species of the Nile was a totem for
Anuket and that they were consumed as part of the ritual of her
major religious festival.[citation needed]
