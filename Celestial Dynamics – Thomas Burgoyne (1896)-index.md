PUBLISHERS' PREFACE.
It was the i·ntention of both the author and publishers to give the reading public "Celestial Dynamics" shortly after the publication of "The Language of the Stars," in 1892, as announced on the cover of that book, but circumstances, over which we have h°ad no control, caused the delay until now. This·explanation is thought sufficient apology to all those who have repeatedly asked when "Celestial Dynamics" would be published. The times are more propitious, and the demand much greater for this valuable work to-day than ever before. Therefore its delay will prove its teachings to be true. "There is a time for everything under the sun." The time for "Celestial Dynamics" is now. May it ever find those ready for its teachings, prepared to realize its sublime truths so ably stated by its author, whose life motto is "Omnia Vincit Veritas."



PREFACE.
"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy."--Shakespeare,
And there are more powers, forces and entities in natur~ than metaphysical practitioners and healers have hitherto thought of much less taken into consideration, and the time has come when such forces must be recogi1ized and acted upon; hence this course of study, the object of which is to deal with, and if possible to elucidate these hidden powe'rs. Whether or not we shall succeed in our difficult.' task remains to be seen. the following brief explanation of our title will 'be of advantage: The words "Ceiestial Dynamics" have been chosen as the broad distinguishing title of that section of human knowledge which would be embraced within a complete science of mental and metaphysical life within embodied conditions; a science devoted almost exclusively. to the imponderable elements of the human organism; "Celestial,"' in the sense of being ethereal~ and similar to those heavenly centers from which the activities emanate, and "Dynamics," as applied to actual force in motion.



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. !I
INTRODUCTION.
The most advanced scientific opinion of today is rapidly nearing the goal of spiritual recognition, and is even now unconsciously dealing with the imponderable principles of occult law. Prof. Tyndall, in his work upon "Heat," Lecture XII, thus eloquentlydescribes the shining central reservoir of energy," and as surely as the force which moves the clock'~ hands is derived from the arm which winds up the clock, so surely is all terrestrial power drawn from the sun. • • • Every mechanical action on the earth's surface, every manifestation of power, organic or inorganic, vital and physical, is produced by the sun. He lifts the rivers and glaciers up to the mountains. • • • Thunder andlightning are also his. transmuted strength. • • • The sun comes to us as heat; he quits us as heat; and between his entrance and departure the multiform powers of our globe appear." They a1"e all special ftwms oj solar power. Louis Figuier, . the author of " The World Before the Deluge," and many other scientific productions, in one of his latest works, "The .To-morrow of Death," thus specu
lates:. "In the Sun, seasons are known



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
no more than days. Time seems to have no existence for the dwellers in that glorious home. The changes and succession of things .which make up life for .us are unknown to their sublime essence. Duration has no measure in that happy world," (Chapter XII). The foregoing extracts have been given to show the general trend of science regarding the principles which form the immutable foundation upon which Celestial Dynamics is based. The glorious central sun of our solar system th.at. rays forth his electrical life for the sustenance of his magnificent family of worlds is, in its material expression and law, but the external covering for the grander and more ethereal spiritual sun, which forms the celestial spheres of. the Solar Angels, of whose infinite radiance, wisdom and power we can form no just conception, even as the physical body of man upon the earth is but the material covering, upon the third dimensional plane; of the bright indwelling soul within. "As it is below, so it is above." As on the material earth, even so do we find the same eternal principles in the shining heavens above. Accordingly, when we recognize in the sun, as the radiating center of all forms of energy and power, light, heat and electricity, all" of which are but different modes of motion, all the outcome of nature's sympathetic response to that awful. and inconceivable center of Deific vi~ bration, we can ·at once comprehend, .as did



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 11
the ancient Seer, the self-evident fact that we owe everything to Him, the great Sun.God of science to-day. He is the immediate source of all we possess. Our bodies are dependent upon his never-ceasing action; our food and clothing are the generous gifts of ~is electrical bounty, and our soul's inspiration and unfoldment are the evolutionary outcome of the same celestial power, for life, light and love are the eternal manifestations of this radiant center.
In our endeavors to understand the hidden workings of nature's law, we must ever bear in mind that the outward form is but the con. crete symbol of an interior cause. The physical sun, as the life-giver of earth, exerts the requisite grade of force necessary for the earth's fullest manifestation, while the Spiritual sun, of which the physical orb is the body, exerts the requisite degree of celestial energy, which in matter becomes occ1t!t force, an~ in man will and mental power.
There is sunlight upon the earth radiating all the natural forces required for nature's wondrous unfoldment, and there is an ethereal sunlight streaming from the same center, illuminating with its spiritual rays both the disembodied Soul and the mind of incarnated genius, for the infinite power which gives animal that instinct so akin to reason, to insects their marvelous skilJ, and to the nightingale its melodious song, is equally with the purer



12 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
spiritual light of the human soul in its higher estate,derived from the Deific center of celestial love. The reader is requested to study closely in connection with this lesson, chapters I, II and III of part II, in "The Light of Egypt." These chapters will clearly explain the distribution of Solar force into planetary influence.



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
CHAPTER I.
THE OCCULT FORCES OF NATURE.
What a wondrous creature is man; and what a wondrous universe it is by which he finds himself eternally surrounded. Day by day, ever prompted by the struggling intuitions of the spirit, science is tearing the grim masks of error and ilJusion aside, and, night by night, while the weary brain is seeking physical rest, the tireless, impulsive soul is winging its way throuJ{h the starlit spaces of Aeth, ever and anon making new discoveries, sensing grander systems and universes than its own, vaguely dreaming ofyet more awful mysteries slumbering within the evolutionary uterus of time and ever longing and aspiring to quench its insatiable thirst for knowledge in the light, love and truth of that Divine wisdom for which it yearns; but forever unable to reach the ideal of its own sublime Spirit, or free itself entirely from the limitations of sense, form and conditional ~nvironments.
Such is life within the boundaries of time, and such is life. within the grander realms of eternity, where time hath no existence, but which is always below the grand ideal of the



H CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
Divine Ego in man. As the Soul grows and expands within the sunlight of Divinity, its senses become more acute and its attributes more awakened; its knowledge of ..the thing-.\· that are" and its powers over· "self" becomes more consCious and positive, its limitations and barriers are less, its opportunities an<l possibilities for the acquisition of the realities of life greater. But there is and will always be comparative limitations, comparative sense conditions and consequently comparative environments, because the human soul is finite, .and cannot transcend itself. Further, Deity is ever in motion and eternaliy progressive in His infinite scheme of unfoldment and creation·, and, though we may, inde~d. become in conscious rapport with creative vibration and in some measure attain the Divine at-one-ment with the Father, yet; this at-'one-ment is but the responsive harmony between the soul and it_s divine center of being, and not the conscious at-one-ment with the Infinite majesty and power of the Deity itself. As John Young saith, "God the Infinite spirit is uncreated, boundless,. formless, eternal, alone," and as such is unapproachable and inconceivable by anything less than Himself. _Hence. is the Divine reality of man's glorious birth-right, Immortality, an unending existence of eternal and conscious progression. The Soul life of man forms a perfect correspondence to the
physical existence, it too hath its longings, as



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 15
pirations. weariness and disappointments, even as the body has; they move within different dimensions of space only, both are real upon their respective planes of manifestation-, but the interior plane is more ethereal and spiritual, consequently infinitely more subtle than the exterior planes of sense and matter. There is a constant reaction between the two, and also between the primary vibrations of physical existence implanted at the moment of conception and set in motion at the moment of birth, and ever-varying vibrations which constitute, by reaction, the pains and pleasures of everyday life. Action and reaction are the dual expressions of that great one-life principle which men call Divine Providence because that which is providential is of necessity lawful and being lawful means being in perfect harmony with the anthem of creative life, consequently, we are all creatures of one Divine law, and our perfect freedom can only be realized when. we are acting in obedience to the laws of universal being. . Freedom exists only as a universal state, and; therefore, to free ourselves, or, in other words, to be free from the reactions of matter, we must realize the absolute. truth of the Hermetic mantram, which says, "My soul is one with the universe and my spirit an emanation from God." The true secret of freedom, then, is to attune our Soul sphere until it beats in rhythmicharmonywith the universal harmony,



16 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
in other words, to intensify the vibrations of the physical organism until they accord in perfect symphony with the vibrations of the indwelling Soul. When this desirable state is attained, the Soul awakes unto the external consciousness of life and its environments, and by virtue of such consciouness arouses into action the higher. and more interior laws of its being, which, in lower states of development, are either entirely dormant, or, at best, only partially active. These higher laws do not conflict with those of lower planes of
action; they transcend them only by a simple change of vibration, which means endowing them with a different polarity. At this point, we impinge upon the boundaries of the great occult forces of nature: occult, because hidden from physical sense, and also hermetic because secret and eternally sealed from those minds still dominated by the gross laws. appetites and passions of the brute-nature within the physical body. Soul consciousness is the first spiritual realization of tl:ie occult forces of nature, and this state of the Soul means wz1l aln"lity. Will, like all other attributes, is an universal force, hence, our capacity to utilize the universal will exists in proportion to our spiritual development in the higher gamut of existence, or, in proportion to our degree of sensitiveness in the lower arc of action. The former·means conscious control of the



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 17
force, the latter simply means being the irresponsible medium for its transmission; these constitute the two poles of its. action and between them lies every phase of mental, magnetic and metaphysical phenomena..To thor
oughly realize this, is to grasp the fuli'.sign.ifi~ cance of the occult law, "As it is below so it is above." Occult Jaws, then, so far as this special course of study is concerned, relate to the hip:her and more interior qualities of the human ·constitution, and their reactions are the physical expressions we find in constant manifestations, both in ourselves and in our surroundings. We must, therefore, gain a thorough knowledge of ourselves an<l be able to conquer all discord and inharmony within, before we attempt to heal our brother who is sick, in other words, we must first of all have removed. the beam out of our own eye before we attempt to remove the mote from the eyes of our neighbor. To /mow ourselves, then, is the.first rung in the occult ladder of knowledge and, in order tQ do this, we must know the hidden force$ which control and bind us within .the planes· of physical life. Man is a -world in miniature and contains within himself .a perfect scal.e of notes, and, no matter what key his nature may accord with or vibrate to, he is a perfect gamut if properly
sounded; he is a part of the great solar system of which our.sun is the center, and, of course, both.it and w are but fractional parts of the



18 ~ELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
still grea.ter Astral system to which our sun belongs and so "ad infinitum." As thei:e are no special laws relating to any individual, no private legislature possible in the Divine economy of creative law, we must be a part of all that transpires in the action and inter-action of the planetary and stellar worlds. Cosmic law must affect us in proportion to our state, as ·it does the dazzling worlds of space. This being so we must first of all look to those primary centers of force and grasp their power before we attempt to bind and meastire the
reactions. of those powers as they become ma-nifest in ourselves. With the foregoing before us, we can see that those powers which mould and guide the life of the. physical man are the vibrations received from the forces which mould and guide the destinies of worlds, the only real difference being the length of the orbit of action; in our own case, a few fleeting seasons only, in the case of worlds, embracing untold millions of ages. Further, the higher and more spirtual laws which confine their a"ction to the Soul of man and the universe are also the s~me, for the spiritual life of man forms a perfect correspondence to. the spiritual iife of the planet, of which he is an atomic part towards an organic whole. All known. physfoal force has its origin in . the suri and is dependent upon solar· action for continued activity. The external sun is but



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 19
an expression of an internal spiritual center of intelligence equal, in its spiritual force upon the interior planes of life, to the physical orb upon the spaces of matter, and, as the physical sun is demonstrated by scie.nce to be the source of all physical life, the spiritual orb must be the celestial center of our Soul-life and the source of all divine possibilities. Solar force and planetary influence are one and the same. The seven planets of the ancients were but the expressions, so to speak, of the perfect scale of force, each planet, being magnetic by means of solar induction, reflected and still reflects one of the great attrilmtes-Saturn the cold, Jupiter the· genial, Mars the fiery, the Suri itself, the majestic and commanding power, Venus, the loving influx in nature, Mercury, .the inventive and commercial principal, and the Moon the negative, mediumistic and maternal attributes. These. powers represent states, and incarnate themselves within each organism. They constitute the primary factors of our being, and must be known if we would obey the Divine injunction, " Man, know thyself." The .. modus operandi" of these powers is that of all nature-" Vibration." In fact, the grand basis of all force is vibration; apart from it there is neither mental activity, divine providenc~ nor physical motion. Vibration is the real source of all phenomena-spiritual, mental and physical. This is no vague dream; it is an absolute fact in



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
nature, and one that is daily receiving scientific recognition in different departments of human knowledge. When we grasp this fact and understand that the metaphysical relationship between external form and mental force is that of vibration. alone, it will at once enable us to realize that higher truth, viz., that all we can possibly conceive in the dual expression of good and evil are due to the simple action of harmonious or discordant vibrations either within or without the human organism. Man _is the perfect expression of the forces of nature at the moment of conception and birth, and their harmonies and inharmonies at these times will find expression within his physical organism, and be the means, in a great measure, of aiding or retarding his spiritual evolution in this stage of human evolution and development. In fact, each human being is, in a representative sense. an instantaneous photograph of the cosmic vibration operating at the moment of birth; his life and actions, in the form of his material destiny. are nature's simple methods of developing the picture. Everything, in fact, depends upon these occult vibrations received from the starry worlds above. Remember these important facts: The magnetic constitution depends entirely for its strength upon the position of the luminaries at birth; the less inharmony prevailing °between
the two the stro~ger the life fo'rce will be, and



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 21
the less liable to suffer from any reactionary forces, termed tendency toward disease. The sun is always electric in its action.and the moon magnetic, all the magnetic states are attractive whiie the electric states are repulsive. It naturally follows that purely magnetic natures will attract disease, especially so if in a depleted state, while electric natures will. repel. This must be borne in mind, because no one should attempt to heal others unless they possess either a surplus vitality or an electric nature. If they disobey this rule they will fail to cure, and, in addition, will attract some portion of the disease, and consequently suffer from inharmony. To all who attempt the healing artdivine, the thorough understanding not only of themselves but of the real magnetic natures of their patients becomes thus an absolute necessity. Such understanding is the true secret of success, and in the following pages it is the purpose to reveal these astromagnetic mysteries, so that the reader may apply the great astrological laws to their own lives and also to arrive for themselves and their fellow men at a fuller realization of Divine truth.

That form of langu3;ge is intelligible to man, if he could only place himself ..enrapport therewith and so understand it, since to man hath been given the dominion over everything both in the heavens l!.hove and in the earth beneath, so that the agnostic who answered in the affirmative, the question, ''Can matter think," approximated the truth.

tion or attribute of writing and so recording its own history, not as man does, in a biased prejudiced manner, but scientifically exact and eloquent with all the stern grandeur and nakedness of sim.ple truth. The great geological chapters of our earth's past history are profoundly instructive, not so much from the Divine revelation o_f her genesis ·and growth there revealed, but for the positive knowledge we obtain of her future and ultimate destiny. And as it is with the earth, so is it with the stars, sun. moon and planets. Mathematics and mental power can reveal their past mutations, conjunctions and transmutations at any given .
period iii the past, so also can the sam~ means foretell, to the day and the hour, their relative ·positions in the universe.at any period in the near or remote future. This, in some sense, is the external language of the starry heavens. It is nature's mathematical form of speech. She speaks thus to the human intellect and, so speakinsz, enables man to assume.the mantle of the prophet and predict future events. But there.is a deeper and more mystical la_nguage than that comprised within the mathematical· alphabet. This interior fanguagP.

see and read the reactions, the discords of nature eternally produced in obedience to the universal law of equilibrium. What, then, is this hidden language, and by what means can we, on earth, not only read heaven's golden alphabet but read the lessons, warnings and revelations aright? It is now our humble duty to answer these questions, and, in doing so, we desire each reader to repeat, and to meditate daily upon the great Hermetic law, viz.: "That which is on the earth is as that which is above in the sky, and that which is above in the heavens is as that which is below on the earth,'' -0r more briefly stated "as it is above, so it is below," by correspondence, this law is .an absolute truth throughout every department of nature. This explains the law of correspondences, and is the one grand key to all metaphysical problems. Occult law and spiritual affinities cannot be mathematically demonstrated in the physical laboratory; the laws and principles which constitute the eternal analogies of nature cannot ·be reached and understood by any purely external method of experiment and reasoning.
This da~s of phenomena is purely spiritual, occult and mental, and consequently must, for understanding, be explored upon that plane of life~ For il_lustration, take th'e first and tenth mansions of a celestial chart of birth. (See "The Language of the' Stars.") The first house governs the personal affairs, disposition, etc.,

etc., of the native, while the tenth rules his credit, business, etc. Physical science at once projects the questions: why is that influencewhat causes the first house to govern life and the tenth honor-and expects an answer that would explain the reasons. \Ve cannot give such an answer. We only know that these are facts-we can prove these statements to be so in the horoscope of any person living or dead; but we cannot, unfortunately, render the answer in the terms and the manner required by science. Our answer would be symbolical and occult because the influence is spiritua'I and mystical, but science would instantly reject such an evasion as a myth or a dream. In· short, the " parting of the ways" has been reached. It is necessary to enter the more interior dimensions of human knowledge where so-called exact science, with its limitations and conventionalities cannot at present.follow. Man is a microcosm, a universe in miniature, a perfect epitome of the heavens. The twelve divisions of the solar year, termed signs of the Zodiac, correspond to and find a complete expression in the twelve divisions of the human organism. (See also "The Language of the Stars.") vVhile the twelve Zodiacal constellations possess the same mystical affinity with the incarnated Soul. But there is a wi<le difference between the two-the sif:ns and the conste!la#ons.
Man, then, must be considered as a com

brain is the highly sensitive medium acting in strict obedience to the harmony or the discord which these vibrations produce. To learn the cause of these is to kno10 ou;'sclves and the forces which are continually urging and predisposing us to the various act!ons ·which constitute in their sum total thi:: plienornena of daily life.
Firstly then, ever remember that the srn~ i'.'. the primary cause of all life. and the moon i'.; the secondary factor, whiie the planets fill :.;p the lights and shadows-the details of the μicture. During the twelve solar months, i.e.., from the sun's entry at the first point of Aries, at the Vernal equinox, until its return to the same place the following year, all the various kinds of human beings are produced possibk in that cycle. The sun, by its own real plat"t and position in the Zodiac shows th~ primary trend of the mental evolution of the race, but by its appa1·ent annual position in the Zodiac it shows the ./>rimtu·y irend of the individual 111a11. while the position of the moon and planets polarizes that force and also reveals the nature and direction of such iMlux. Therefore, to learn the hidden na.tur~ of the forces dominating any given person, it is necessary to understand all the eiementary principles of astronomy :.3.n.d astrology, in other words, to become perfectly familiar with the external alphabet of the celestial language.

tho~e external symbols, we commence the firs-I simple forms of that language whose rhythmic vibrations caused the great Samian Sage, Fyth~goras, to formtilate its nature to his chosen disciples as "the music of the spheres.'· There are twenty-two characters or letters in the alphabet, exactly the same number as in the r-lebrew which was based upon similar principles. These are the Sun, Moon, Nepi:une, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and the planet Mercury; these constitute the voweh and the diphthongs; then come the consonants, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn. A.quadus, and Pisces, known as the signs of the Zodiac, and lastly, the Earth, or@, which [:; a mere cipher, like the twenty-second letter of Hebrew, in fact, from a symbolical point of view, there is a wonderful affinity betwe<::n the basic constitution of the two. · To commence with the most important orb, the Sua stands forth as the central force of all.

birth, the life force or physical vitality will suffer in proportion. His vibrations are electrical, hot, commanding, penetrating and aspiring. In the fiery signs he is the most powerful, next in the airy, then the earthy and, lastly, in the watery where he is weakest of all. The Moon is next in importance, she appears in power as the hand-maid and bride of the Sun, and reigns as the minister of the Solar bounty. She rules the vital force in \Voman and the love. in man~ She has chief control of the intuition of both sexes, and is most potent in the watery signs, next in the earthy, then in the airy and weakest of all in the realm of fire. She thus stands forth as the polar opposite ·of the sun, his other half in 11alure. Her vibrations are magnetic, cool, yielding and formative. She rules the breast, stomach and the entire fluidic system of t~e organism.. The planet Mercury comes forth in capacity of interpreter. Messenger of the gods, he partakes of the character of each and all with whom he is associated by aspect at the moment of birth. His nature is therefore convertible and either good, bad or indifferent as the case may be. To him is given· the chief rule of the mental qualities. He polarizes the solar influx in the brain and so gives direction and bias to the external mind. He .rules the tongue and nervous system. His vibrations ~re changea~le..



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
The planet Venus comes next, sweet child of the ocean foam, she stands forth in the starry tongue as the representative of mirth. domestic love, art and music. She is the chief ruler of the internal sex and generatiYe functions of humanity, and has especial influence of a peculiar nature over the group of diseases peculiar to females. She rules the ovaries and the venous system. Her vibrations are magnetic, moisture producing. warm, producing the ideal and sublime and are also benefic in the second degree. Mars, the God of war, is our next force and appears as the representative of strife, energy. destruction and combativeness. He has chief rule over the passions and animal appetites and rules the external sexual organism, the muscles and sinews. His vibrations are electrical, fiery, disruptive, sharp and cutting. ever tending to inflammation, opposition and change. He is also malefic in the second degree. The planet Jupiter stands forth as the symbol of authority, as the social, noble,. paternal guide and has chief rule over those function~; that establish law, order, commerce and theology. He rules the arterial system of the body and his vibrations are electric, health giving, inspiring, tending to magnanimity in all things arid benefic in the first degree. The planet Saturn stands forth as the symbol of old age, the antithesis of life and vigor,



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. si
he is the harbinger of sorrow, disease and inharmony, and has chief rule over the reflective and reasoning faculties. He rules the bones, liver and spleen. His vibrations are cold and death-like, magnetic in nature and malefic in the first degree. The foregoing constitute the first gamut of notes; they are the seven vowels, and from this a higher key is sounded which we term the dipthongs, as they are convertible or double, that is, contain two qualities, as a dipthong contains the double sound of two vowels. Uranus, the mystery planet, stands as the first orb in the higher octave .of force. He is chief ruler of the occult, mystical and metaphysical qualities of man, and governs the odyllic sphere, or magnetic aura of ,the organism, and is therefore representative of all mental, magnetic and occult medicine for the cure of disease. His vibrations are cool, dectro-magnetic, and tend to change and reconstruction. Neptune, the second diphthong, stands last in order and also remotest from the sun. His chief rule is over the imaginations and the fair realms of Utopia. His action is upon the mind, and nt'.!ver expressed directly upon the physical plane. He expresses tht: higher or Platonic love in man, and his vibrations are also electro-magnetic, like those of Uranus. but more ethereal, and also convertible.

CHAPTER III.
THE vITAL FORCE.
The Vital force, which is the life force which gives strength and action to the physical· organism, is a very different essence to that which gives manifestation to the mental and intellectual qualities. The two are totally different and distinct from each other, as may be seen in the case of an idiot enjoying robust physical health and of an intellectual genius with poor health and delicate constitution. But these forces may be capable of expressing a wonderful energy when acting in consort with each other through harmonious co-operation. The force which we shall deal with principally in this chapter is that quality of the biune life force which relates to physical being, health, strength, and energy of the human body, and which increases, limits or decreases its powers of function in strict ratio to its strength and tone of vibration. Before entering upon this very important subject, a few preliminary considerations are necessary. A given organism, which in its sum total constitutes the external clothing or temple of an incarnated Soul, is, according to its degree of evolution, the status or condition in which that Soul is required by nature to ,exercise its functions.



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
In order to give being, in the first place, to such an organism, a germ sou.I or seed containing all the latent potentialities of the future form fr; necessary. This is supplied by the mother; the dectrical or vitalizing current is given by the father. Upon the exact balan~e of these two depends the perfect balance of the physical human organism of the futurt' chik1, ·we mean the physical balance, not mental. The i:1tense vibrations set in motion during ;;he conjugal union may cause either intellectual, physical, moral, sensual or the criminal tendencies of nature to become dominant at birth, or, as is most generally the case, a combin::;.tion of two or more of these qualities. But, springing from the ovum in the womb, the physical organism as it rapidly builds itself together under the evolutionary impulse of the electro-magnetic life force set in motion by the parents, is of itself nothing but a semisolid wrapper, an aggregation of crystallized atoms which acts as the covering for the electro-vital form which is the true source of its strength or weakness. '.fhis form receives and radiates throughout the entire nervous system a special quality or degree of the universal life essence of nature, and it can only absorb and radiate that peculiar grade of such essence which is in perfect rapport with its own special state, plane and polarity, and this grade or status is the tone. the ke1•-11otc to which the electro-vital consti



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
tution vibrates and which in turn sets in motion ~nd controls the respo11sizrc 'l'ibrations of the external physical form. This subject alont: would fill a volume if dealt with in proportion to its importance and merit. For the present purpose it will suffice to indicate a few selfevident differences in human polarity, due to this difference of electro-vital vibration. Some natures delight in close city life, and are Orlly healthy when so situated; others require a rural home; some thrive in a high altitude- a table land. Some require the lower planes. others require the swamps and dense forests. Some natures can only enjoy good health in the mountains, others require the sea-coast. Of course in the artificial life of to-day, the product of applied mental force; and, under civilized methods of rendering naturally uncongenial localities suitable for habitation, we do not observe this process of "natural selection" carried to any marked extent. It is a fact in nature, nevertheless. and is instinctive!) followed by simple so-called savage tribes of people in their choice of a home, on the same principles that affect the migration of birds and beasts. In a natural state these·• children of nature" unerringly seek their congenial habitat, and that selection depends upon the tone of their physical requirements, due to vibration, which is the celestial dynamic energy expressing itself through their organic natures from birth.



36 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS,
Claudius Ptolemy, who flourished during the latter part of the first and the beginning of the second century of the Christian era, and who is justly entitled the father of modern astrology, in aphorism 86 of his great work, the "Centiloquium," says, "The Sun is the source of the vital power, the Moon of the natural power," and the astrological experience of all noted professors during the subsequent 1800 years has verified the truth of his brief statement. The true source of the vital power in man is' derived frori1 the Sun. He forms the vitalizing section of huma.nity, while the true source of the vital power in woman is the moon. She constitutes the nat11r-al, or maternal section of humanity, as natio was the goddess of birth, and the word "natural" is derived from "nasco," which means to be born. Of course, there are many slight variations from the strict application of this rule, also many combinations of the Sun and Moon interacting with each other, producing in some people not only a strangely dual constitution, but also a luni-solar vitality. These variations will be duly noticed as we proceed. The primary considerations are, firstly, the cosmic energy exerted by the Sun. In the northern hemisphere the greatest vitalizing power is from the twenty-first of March until the twenty-first of June. The second grade of force or intensity is from the twenty-first of



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 87
June until the twenty-first of September. The third grade is from December twenty-first until March twenty-first, and the least potential of all the quarters is from September twenty-first until the same date in December, when the sun reaches the lowest point in the cosmic arc of life in the northern hemisphere. Th-4s, for instance, a child born with a ·given sign rising in November will never, all other conditions being equal in the two cases, equal in vitality and strength another child born under the same sign in April. These are im,. portant facts· to remember. Secondly, ·the signs of the Zodiac have a
special force as mediators, etc., by forming specially favorable conditions, or otherwise, for t°his life essence to manifest itself in the organism. The fiery and airy, or. masculine signs, as ·they are termed, form the strongest conditions in a male horoscope, when rising at birth, while· the earthy and watery, or feminine signs give the best possible conditions in a female natus. .With the foregoing con~iderations before us, Jet us now descend to the practical details which are based upon "the following rules:
I. The sun is always hyleg in a male hor
oscope by day, .i.e., when the sun is above the
horizon. · II. When the sun is below the horizon in a male natus the. vital force undergoes a ,change·, and if the moon be above the horizon



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
it becomes a joint ruler of the vital force, ren~ dering a }uni-solar vitality. Ill. When neither the sun nor moon be above the horizon at birth, then the ascendant of the horoscope becqmes the joint ruler of the native's vital force. IV. In a feminine horoscope substitute the moon for the sun and the same rules will apply.. Thus we find that man's vital nature is governed by the sun alone, when the sun is able to manifest its own force by being above the horizon. But when not so placed, the moon, if above the horizon, shares this function wz'th the sun, giving a luni-solar force; and when neither of the luminaries are above the horizon, the ascendant and the sun become the givers of life. With a woman the case is reversed. When the moon is above the horizon
it is the sole ruler of vitality... If not, and the
sun be there, she is under a luni~solar force;
and when neither are so situated she is ruled by the ascendant .and the moon. So that after all, the real vital center of woman is the moon, and the vital center of man is the sun, .the ascendant being only a point of reaction. In judging the strength· or weakness of the vital forces operating.~t birth, proceed as follows:
L If the hy!eg be afflicted by the evil as
pects of Uranus, Saturn o,r Mars, the li.fe essence will be vitiated in proportion to such affliction.



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS
II. If the. hyleg be free from affliction of such malefics the life essence is fairly strong and the life will be of good average duration. III. If, in addition to the foreg·oing, t!1e hyleg receives the assistance of benefic aspects from Mars, Jupiter or Venus a good length of life is assured, because the vital forces are intense in their vibrations, and with care a ripe old age may easily be obt;lined by s~:-:h a native.
IV. :If; on ·the contrary, the hyieg be weak and at the same time much afflicted by the malefic orbs, the vital forc·e is much belO\·\' nature's requirements and death in infancy is the general result, and, should the ascendant
be weak also, an early death is certain. In
spite ·of all· Christian, metaphysica1 ·and medi
cal science, death tm'll dqz°m its proper due.
Clahdius Ptolemy, previously quoted, gives an almost infallible: rule ·for foreseeing death
in infancy, viz~. "If one of the luminaries be angular and either joined to a malefic, or: if the latter he at an equal longitudinal distance from each lumina-ry: (that is equi-distant) so as to form an equilateral triangle with them, and no benefic..·aspecting them ·at the time, and the rulers of the lumiQ::i.ries be in malefic places, the child th'en born will not be reared but will shortly die/" · To the uninitiated this ·may· seem to be
words without- meaning, but it is a truth whi~h ,the alat:hor has verified in scores of z::ases.



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
All those who attain a ripe old age have the vital points of their Horoscope strong, these are the Sun, Moon and ascendant, and those who die young have them weak. The physical constitution depends for its strength upon its polarity, and this is deter., mined, firstly, by the sign rising and, secondly, upon the polarity of the Moon. There are many thousands of peopie with a very strong vitality combined with a somewhat delicate physical constitution, who are always in rather delicate health and "ailing," yet who manage to Jive to a good old age, while the stout robust looking people around them die off in the very prime of life. Some professors would say that this was due to the "directions'' and,
while admitting due potency to such arcs of
force, yet I have seen apparently powerful physical natures die under the weakest of di- .
rections and, per contra, I have seen weakly looking mortals survive in spite of the most ominous train of "arcs of directions." Long
years of experience and patient research into the hidden causes of such discrepancie-s. have revealed to me the fact that the physical constitution and the vital essence thereof vibrate to differentdegreesofforce; that, while the Sun and Moon are the <lispensers of vital energy, the sign rising at birth and planets therein, if there be any combined with the polarity of the Moon at the time, determines the exact polarity of the physical organism, and, upon



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. !I
the temperament thus manifested depends the general physical health. But the vital current of life is not so dominated. This depends solely upon the vital status of the luminaries, chiefly the sun in man and the moon in woman, with either the one or the other, or ascendant as a simple center of redction only, when the proper Hyleg1cal luminary is below the horizon. In all research of an occult or an astrological nature ever remember. this law, viz., that the sun is the one great central fountain of all action and the moon the parent of its manifestation. In other words, the Sun is the father and the Moon the mother of everything and all phenomena that eventuate upon the earth.



42 'CELESTIAL DYNAMIC~.
CHAPTER IV.
THE 'tEMPERAMENT, PHYSICAL AND MAGNETIC.
. 'l here are two distinct temperaments in man, one purP.ly physical and the other magnetic, and these are due to polarity. ·The p'.1ysical temperament is determined by the 5ign ri::.ing at birth along: with the. planet or planets within that sign, if there be any, and the polarity of. ·the moon. The .masculine signs ::!re electric and the feminine signs are magnetic. Jupiter, Mars and the Sun are also electric ii1 nature, \vhile Saturn, Venus and the J.\1oon are magnetic. Uranus is .electro-magnetic a:nd Mercury is either the one or the or.her according to his condition and aspect at the moment of birth. The temperament will .~cnsequently vary according to the influences ;i~ ·v;rcrk. At this point a. slight digression will ~·tn ~ to a clear understanding. All strength, whether it be vital, mental, ma.gnetic or physical, depends solely upon the on~ condition-harmony. All weakness, on tb:: contrary, depends upon the antithesis of harmony, which we term discord, and according· tc the status of these two conditions will be. the so-called good and evil. In fac.t, every thing that eventuates within the prescribed limits of our environment, wherein we are compelled by nature to Jive and move, oscilhter; between these two simple states of vibra



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 43
tion. Life and death, health and · disease, happiness arid .misery; success and. failure, mental vigor and imbecility, are the mundane results which spring forth from the action and
reaction of the. dynamic pendulum of nature in the one eternal ceaseless struggle towards a cosmic equilibrium. This is a most important consideration as affecting "temperament," as will be seen as we proceed.
I. If an electrical sign ascend at birth and the Moon at the same time occupies one .o~ the same nature, the organism will have at1 harmonious· vibration; And of these signs, tlie. fiery gives the· greatest physical strength, and, further, t~ese conditions are manifested in their greatest intensity in a male horoscope. II. If the Moon occupies a magnetic sign ~ind a similar sign be rising, the same har~ monious resui'ts will occur, but of a different character, viz., magnetic, and will mariifest their· greatest force in the horoscope .of a female. ·
HI. . Magne~ic planets in an dectriC sign, or electric planets in a magnetic sig,n,, give a dual nature and cause the temperamen~ to b~ electro-magnetic.
IV. If the sign rising .be electric and the sign occupied by the .Moon .be magnetic, o.r vice versa, the ~ame ·dual result· in temperam~nt will occur. V. Sometimes it will be found that ,the



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
natures will conflict somewhat. For inst'ance, suppose a person is born with Cancer rising with the planet Mars in that sign, and, at the same time, the Moon occupies a magnetic ·sign, we have an electro-magnetic ascendant and a magnetic polarity for. the Moon. Now, if such an instance transpired in the natus of a female, the temperament would be magnetic, because the external force is more magnetic than electric, and females incline to, or are naturally of the magnetic polarity, and the balance of power would, therefore, be given to the feminine force. But,.on the con
trary, 'if such a case was a male natus, the temperament would be electro-magnetic because man inclines towards the electric element in nature and would lend his own natural powers to this plane and form the balance. Having given the general rules we will now briefly examine the particulars in forming a correct judgment. Firstly, then, pay particular attentfon to the sign rising; this sign, if there be any planet therein, will give the correct physical temperament. Fiery signs give a dry caloric temperament. Earthy signs give a cool phlegmatic temperament. Airy signs give a volatile, nervous temperament, while the watery signs produce a cold, lymphatic temperament. Then secondly, add to this the nature of the planet or planets ig the rising sign, and that one which is located nearest to the



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 4a
cusp of the ascendant will predominate over all the others in its external action upon the organism.
If there should be no planet in the ascending sign, observe· the Moon, and combine the influence of the Moon (without any regard to her aspects) with the sign rising, and the correct physical temperament will be obtained. The reason we ignore the lunar aspects in this case is because the aspects affect the mind and not the external temperament which we are now considering. And' these two are very different or distinct factors in the system we are now elucidating, viz., the metaphysics of astrology, and not the exoteric, orthodox science of the ordmary astrological professor who usually knows absolutely nothing of the higher aspects-the celestial dynamics of his peculiar prognostic art. From what has been stated regarding the electric and magnetic natures of the signs and planets, it will be very easy for the student to discover wht!th'er a person be of electric, magnetic or electro-magnetic temperameht. This is of great importance or value in healiug- and treating-. A few more considerations upon this point are needed. Electric natures repel ideas and thoughts unless they appeal to their inner natures, and they never become dominated by them. On the contrary, magnetic natures attract thoughts and ideas, and very soon become dominated by them, and if not,



46 CELESTIAL DYANM ICS.
they always assimilate them in some form or other. Vlhi!e electro-magnetic natures alternately attract and repel, they do not possess true consistency; they are all one thing under one state or cond·itic:in, and are quickly all enthusia·;;m for something eise directly the attracting c11rtent is withdrawn. They delight in the menrai ·whirl of the day and obtaintheir degree of satisfaction therefrom until something new or mare attractive turns their changeable, volatile r.at:ures in another direction.
It only remains now to point out how to guage the real disposition of a person-not their external or apparent natures, but the reality of the reai inner self which cannot be bounded by written law, customs. ·or the conventional usage& of society. Perhaps an illustration of om meaning will aid the reader.
For instance, a man that will deliberately steal another person's ideas for the purpose of passing them off before the world as his own and gaining benefit thereby, is just as much a deliberate thief as the criminal who robs a bank or picks a pocket. Equally so is the man or woman who will maliciously rob a person of their reputation and character, or create str!fe between relations and companions for some dishones~ motive, and thus steal a person's friendship from them. This kind of theft lJ the worst of· all, as Shakespeare recognized when he wrote, "But he who
filches .froa• me my good name robs me of



CELESTIAL DYN.A:MICS. 47
that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed," so with morality, thousands of advanced minds cannot endure the thoroughly artificial· code· of morality recognized by society,-they defy it and foilow a code of their own more in accordance with their peculiar plane of life. The world considers such people heretics of dangerous immorality, whereas they are generally the most thoroughly moral people of their time, in an ethical sense. Morality is a question of principle, not of obedience to a sham or an appearance. Hundreds of thousands who are rigid supporters of the regulation proprieties of society are notoriously immoral in their private relationships. Therefore in guaging the disposition it must be understood that the revelations of this scienee must be considered in an ethical· sense, because they have an ethical value only, and may not exactly tally with the opinion and appearance of the person under consideration. Carefully apply the following rules: I. Note down the physical and vital temperament. . IL If they agree in nature, it shows a strong moral bias, but if they conflict in nature, it shows the contrary.
III. Note the condition of the Sun and Moon, if they are afflicted by Uranus, Saturn or Mars without any benefic assistance to



!8 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
counteract such affliction, then the moral bias is weak. IV.· If the influences are good and evil combined, then the person will follow out the conditions in which they find themselves, moral, immoral, or both in turn, as the conditions require.
V. If the tempera~ents agree and the Moon is free from affliction, and the Sun also free, it shows a very powerful moral bias, a rigid sense of duty. VL When the temperaments are harmonious, and the Sun and Moon free from evil aspects, and at the same time in friendly aspects with each other, it shows the very highest conditions. Such a person becomes extremely sensitive of his obligations and would become a· patriot to his country and suffer martyrdom for· what he considered right. The general nature and hoe of active expression that the foregoing would assume will depend upon many conditions; the mental qualites, the plane of life in which the person is born, and education, will each have a great influence, but the chief of these will be noticed i'n future chapters, and especially in our next, when the manifestation of the disposition in its relation to the mental status will be considered.



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 411
CHAPTER V.
THE MENTAL AND INTELLECTUAL POWERS.
Among every generation of astrologers it has been an undisputed axiom that the mental qualities of the child born depend chiefty upon the position of Mercury and the Moon. But, like all general truths, this a:xiom is only relatively true. Undoubtedly, the combined influence of these two bodies exert a powerful inftuence upon every human being. This point is not disputed, but the external manifestation of such influence is subject to wonderful variations and modifications. In different individuals, the very same aspects, with the same relative positions to eac:.11 other, will produce widely different mental results. To assert, for instance, that the conjunction 9r sextile of ·Venus to Mercury confers artistic talent or musical abili.ty, while generally true
in a majority of cases, may be wholly erroneous in !f.me particular nativity. So, also, Mer«;ury, rising at birth, does not always confer lit_erary power or scientific skill. Such a posi. tion is only one of the chief factors of men
t~f superiority, but in order to become active, it must be in unison with the whole mental organism. To account for the great disparity of men
~al and moral bias emanating from apparently



i>O CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
similar positions of the heavens, many other\v.:se talenfed astrologers are now drifting- into the fatal error of the theory of re-1~irlh. If this theory is correct, si::icntific astrology is imposs~bl.-::, and it~ <.1:::duiness vanishes into the
thin ,.1 r of incomprehensible metaphysics. Fortunately, however, it is not necessary for the swdent to. fall back upon the unverifiable delusion of reincarnation in order to account for genius. " Past earth lives" and the cumulative effect of a previous karma uptJn the mental, moral and financial status of the presen~ embodied individuals are, of all the speculative follies in which the undeveloped human mind has indulged, the most insidious and ensnaring, especially to the half awakened Souls who possess a natural Jove for occult and metaphysical studies; they see as through a glass darkly, and feel satisfied that the half understood subtleties of oriental · dogmas rationally solve the problem of good and evil, mental genj.us and mediocre brains. AH such mystical illusions, however, are incapable of passing the only real test we can accept. viz., ![emtine proof. At. most, such theories can amnunt to nothing more than matters of personal opinion, and, as a scien
tific investigator, the author challenge<.; th~ ingenuity of man to distil <:>ne :ltom of common sense i!1i.o the vagadeg and metaphysical subtleties of reincarnation or: the sp~culative phantasmagora of its accompanying absur<li



CELESTIAL :PYNAMICS. 51
ties. To the earnest searcher after facts, who is free from the subtle intoxication of Oriental Hermeneutics, such theories are interesting only as distorted pictures which, during the processes of evolution, represent the strange abberations of the human mind. Those who have eyes to see and brains to u·nderstand the things which they do see in astrological science, will readily come to the conclusion that the heavens furnish the key to all apparent contradictions in the mental, moral and financial expressions of the sons of men.. Nothing eventuates as the offspring of chance.· Universal law reigns, but this law is only applicable to un-iversals, not to particulars. Particulars, in the affairs of life, are not
the offspring of the st~rs only; indirectly they spring into being as the outcome of act:on and reaction between individuals, and may be called the fruits of humari association. Herein comes into play man's free will. Capacity is the measure of free will, and ability the exact limit of his obligation. Outside these conditional limits the human soul incurs no responsibility. Remember these facts. They are the secrets of g·ood and evil. The mental an<l intellectual qualities de-· pend upon the polarity of the brain and temperament of the physical organism. ~rhis latter has been fully explained in the last lesson; the present remarks will be confined to the former.



· CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
The position of the sun and moon determines the brain polarity in all cases. The planet Mercury shows by his position and aspect the native qualities of the intellectual force. When the Moon is in aspect to Mercury she always points out the individual peculiarities of this force. Benefic aspects give the mental forces an harmonious, moral, generous bias; malefic aspects the opposite. George Peabody, ·the philanthropist, and Thomas Carlyle are fine types of the exti;emes of the benefit force and discordant rays. Peabody looked upon each human being as his b.rother. Carlyle could only see the perturbations of human life. In the latter's estimation Great Britain contained "thirty millions of people mostly fools." To view the failings of our neighbors with a microscope, anrl those of ourselves or friends through the large end of a telescope is a sign1of a distorted mentality, the result of· the malefic aspects of the heavens at the moment of birth externally, but which originated within the inharmonious spheres of our parents at the moment of conception upon the interior planes of our vital expression. · The gener-al formula for determining the mental and intellectual qualities is, therefore, as follows.: The polarity of the sun and moon at the time of birth gives the exact polarity of the brain. This polarity, combined with the temperament, represents the individual ca- · pacity of the native. The aspects of Mercury



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
and the Moon combined with the influence of any planet (if there be such) rising near the ascendant, represent the individual a/JilitJ•. The sum of these two conditions embrace the total of human life in its mental and intellec
tual expression. It will be apparent, therefore, that a pe·rson may possess large .capacity for knowledge or art, but may not possess the ability to express this capacity in the external form, while, per contra, a person may have a very limited capacity combined with very large ability for expression, such a combination will exfn·ess the utmost possible to such a brain, and its possessor will be rated at more than his true worth, and vice ·versa. But, when we find a large capacity combined with an equally large administrative ability, then we find true genius, the nature. of which will correspond exactly to the plane occupied by the native, the finer the conditions the greater the genius. A section of hell is always necessary in the physical residuum of true genius.
It is the spice which gives it flavor. In order to gauge the polarity ofthe Sun and Moon it is necessary for the student to thoroughly understand the exact nature of each of the twelve signs upon the intellectual plane. (These are described fully in part second of ..The Light of Egypt.") No other plane must be taken into consideration. Further, it must be understood that each sign represents a section of the physical constitution, which has



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
a metaphysical correspondence with the mental princ;ples. This is why people born under different signs contact or sense things, actions motives and surroundings from different standpoints or pianes, consequently those born under the same triplicity generally agree upon general outlines, but differ in particulars denoted by the special signs. The tweivc different planes from which the different polarities of the brain react, are as follows: Aries disposes· the brain to sf:nse. things from the logical, scientific plane destitute of fee/£ng.
Taurus, from the cautious, ration::i!, materiai planes of sense and appetite; it is noncomrnital. Gemini, frorn the volatile·, idea( executive and purely ir;~ellectual plane of action. Cancer, from the formative, sensative, reflective and maternal planes of action. Leo, from the heart, the love instincts, and the emotional planes of action. Virgo, from the aspirational, the sympathetiG and the compassional planes. Libra, 1rnm the el!ualizing instincts, also the sublime and sentimental planes of action.,. Scorpio. from the · passional or animal instincts, also the sexual and conjugal centers. Sagittarus, from the mi~ratory instincts also the impulsive {thoughtless) and conventional P,,1anes.~ '



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
Capricorn, from the diplomatic and the selfish but cautious, reflective planes. · · Aquarius, from the metaphysical conception and the intuitional plane. Pisces. from the spiritual or Soul center, in its highest expression, in gross natures, from the magnetic, irresponsible or mediumistic plane.
How TO RESTRAIN CRIMINAL TENDENCIES.
A few words of advice and warning ·upon the subject of this chapter are in order: Realize the fact that there is no suci1 thing as radical evil. Evil, so called, is only discordant vibration wh~r,h requires tuning up to the proper pitch, to so express it, in order to act in unison or harmony with the rest of the organism. There can be. no criminal tendency that is not a distortion of some beautiful function. Age and the adverse environments may, of course, so crystallize these conditions that human effort is useless. It is not for those who have passed the age of maturity that these instructions are written, but for the salvation of the young, the rising.generation who govern the future. When, from the Horoscope, evil conditions of the mind are perceived, consult a practical phrenologist, note the organ expressing this astral discord, and then set earn~stly to work to alter such, by cultivation and education of
~he opposite forces. Constantly hold the



56 . CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
child in the mental image of exactly opposite tendencies. In time, this mental action will completely polarize the criminal or disordered trait. Mental power continually exercised over the growing immature brain will crystailize all the inharmony and render such function practically nil in later life. The mental image projected by the metaphysician will take root and grow and ultimately, like a good graft upon some worthless seedling, bear fair and lovely fruit. Ever remember that whatever is, is good, undeveloped though it be.

CHAPTER VI.
THE FINANCIAL PROSPECTS.
These depend chiefly upon the harmony by which we find the luminaries surrounded at birth, and the harmonious or discordant conditions of the meridian have also much influence upon finance. These are the principal or primary factors, but to thoroughly understand their true import we must penetrate below the external husk and discern the why, the how and the wherefore of such celestial influence. A careful study of Chapter five, Part II, of the "Light of Egypt," .will show the stude.nt that man, as the microcosm, has an alchemical, or mineral constitution-in other words, that we each possess a certain mineral status. This' mineral quality represents our
mone')' g-etting- force. If, therefore, we find the chief rulers of the two precious metals which represent hard cash, silver and gold-the sun and moon, discordant and weak in our horoscope, we may rest assured that we do not possess the affinity necessary to acquire wealth. The forces are attractive and diffusive, attractive and accretive, negatively repellent, and positively repellent ·according to conditions. - When the mineral vibrations within us are .positively repellent, we remain in poverty all



58 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
throug~'. l!f::.; when negatively repelient we remain ..::~;nparatively poor, but do not suffer actuai poverty. When the vibrations are attractive and have the polarity of accretion we amass wealth; when the forces are attractive and diffusive we obtain much money during life, but, almost in spite of our best efforts it goes as fast as it comes. We become spendthrifts, and saving is the last thing we can do. RememLer the important fact, then, that each living individual has some pecuiiar mineral quaiity within which vibrates in unison with some natural source of wealth and, of course, is equally antagonistic to some other gr,ade. To discover this quality and apply our efforts to this department of nature is to secure the very highest results, financially, that this life can yield. It is equally and exactly upon this basio;; tbat certain geographical loca· tions are fortunr1te for some individuals and unfortunate for others. The minc'r~l quality of the magnetic currents in the earth agreeing or harmonizing with a person render him what is called fortunate, that is, there is financial harmony. Bad luck, so-called, is financial discord. As illustrative of the foregoing. the fa.cts of the two. following cases significantiy dissimilar, are witi1in the writer's personal knowledge. An English gentleman was m ve.ry crarnpi::d circumstances, was always unfortu



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
nate and failed in everything he undertook in his native country. He emigrated to Austra-· lia, comparatively penniless, but, apparently, leaving his us"ual misfortun~ in the land of his birth, for he became lucky, married well and was soon quite rich. A French gentleman, born near La Vende, came to England, after trying everything in his own country without success, he started out as a waiter in a French restaurant, finally became the proprietor and got rich. He returned to France to live upon his means and through local investments quickly lost everything he possessed. The instances of people, penniless and often poverty stricken, who, emigrating from Europe to the United States of America, and there becoming rich and often amassing great wealth are numerous enough. That may Le regarded as a natural consequence., yet many remain in circumstances scarcely superior to those of their native. land, while· the inequalities of fortune attaching to apparently similar conditions· are well known. On the other hand, numerous instances are in the writer's knowledge of native born Americans who could hardly live because of their unfortunate surroundings in America, yet who, on emigraiing to England, became fortunate and well tc do. Such facts require somethirig more than that convenient scapegoat, coincidence, to. explain a\vay. The true reason is , their mineral status agreed with -the mag~



60 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
netic currents of the country they removed to. The definite rules, or rather methods, of procedure in the consideration of financial prospects is to first ascertain whether the native is attractive or the reverse. Thtts, if the luminaries are strong and well aspected, and the second house and the midheaven unaffhcted, and Jupiter and Venus unafflicted, the native's mineral constitution is powerfully
attractive. If, in such a case, Mars aspect the luminaries, or be in the second or tenth house, the native is diffusive, the stronger Mars is the more diffusive the native becomes. If Saturn is strong and unafflicted and aspect the luminaries, or be in the second or tenth house, the native's mineral quality is full of accretion, he saves and increases what he gets and so acquires wealth. The second or tenth house, occupied by Venus or Jupiter, and they strong and unaffiicted and aspecting the luminaries, give the very highest conditions for financial success. But, on the contrary, when the Sun and Moon are weak. afflicting each other or afflicted by others, then the quality of vibration is antagonistic to riches, if at the same time Saturn or Mars, or both ohhem, be much afflicted and in the second or tenth house and afflict the Sun or Moon, the native will remain perpetually poor and had better be contented with his lot. From the foregoing, it will be seen that the second house of the horoscope, the merid



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 61
ian, or tenth as it is called, with the Sun and Moon, comprise the foundation, the basis of the native's fortune, while the planets by their condition, position and aspects point out the results. Jupiter and Venus give financial success, when strong, through trade and professional patronage, Mercury; through mental and intellectual exertions, Mars, through military or mechanical efforts where fire and steel are used, Saturn, through mining and the offspring of the ground. .The details of all these are given fully in "The Language of the Stars.'' · It will be noticed that Mars squanders wealth; while Saturn either hoards it up or prevents the .native from getting any at all. Under no circumstances can Saturn make a prodigal nor Mars a miser. So Jupiter, though giving wealth through patronage, merchandise, etc ' when afflicted, wastes substance by carelessness, or lack of business habits, ·etc., as much as by bad judgment in using money. There are, naturally, many degrees between these extremes, cases wherein the influences are balanced and others in which they may be extended a little either one way or the otber;. to judge these requires long experience and continued observation. .Jn order to command all the possibilities of success which nature gives, the temperament and mental qualities must, first,.be carefully .borne in. mind, then, theo harmony or dis



62 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
cord of the financial nature must be considered, and, lastly, the careful combination of all these elements will indicate the natural department of life for which the native is best adapted. If the tenth is afflicted, the native should never go into business on his own account, he will always succeed best in the
employ of others. If 'the second is afflicted, he should never leave on.e situation until another is ready, otherwise suffering may ensue. If the tenth is strong and benefics therein, that quality of employment should be chosen that harmonizes with the Sun and the tenth. For instance, if Taurus was upon the meridian and Jupiter in the tenth house and at the same time not in aspect with the Sun, but Venus in friendly aspect, choice should be made of some employment which combine the nature of Venus in its quality and of Jupiter in its methods,- whereas, if Saturn was afflicted in the tenth, the native should avoid all Saturnine occupations unless he desires to taste misfortune. These . instances will suffice to show the procedure; practice is n~cessary to become expert. For the various details of business qualifications arid the choice of employments, reference may be made to "The Language of . the Stars," page 14, et seq. · A few remarks upon the subject of speculation, will fittingly close this chapter. Whenever the fifth house of the horoscope is occu



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
p1ea hy a malefic, or the luminaries arc afflicted, speculation must always be strictly
avoided. If a horoscope is naturally an un· fortunate one, the same remarks will appiy. If the malefics are_afflicted and occupy the tenth or second house without any counteracting testimony, nothing but loss can come from speculation. On the contrary, a benefic well aspected in the fifth, especialiy if it is also the lord of the fifth, or rules the Sun or Moon, and· is in aspect therewith, indicates good fortune in speculations and risky enterprises. ·when no planets occupy the fifth, but when the lords of the second and fifth houses are in good aspect to each other and to the luminaries, gain by speculation may be expected; and, la.stly. whel} the lord of the fifth is a. benefic, and strong in the tenth or second, it is a stron~ sign of success through speculation.

CHAP'I'ER VII.
LOVE AND MARRIAGE.
Perhaps one of the greatest boons to humanity is th.at of a happy marriage, and yet how very few happy unions there are in comparison to the number of marriages. The history of divorce is the record of human ignorance and folly. True love between husband and wife means noble and virtuous children, if the parents are not wicked or im
pure, and poSBess .interior aspirations. It would be safe to assert that, if all marriages were based upC>.n love, with wisdom in selection· of partners, radical crime would disappear from the earth in a single century.. lgnprance alone is the grim monster of human suffering. A knowledge of natural law is absolutely essential to harmony, and natural law, when traced upon the lines of physical manifestation only, is very apt to deceive us with its myriad delusions. To be certain of our knowledge we must trace this law beyond the limits of the planet upon which it is manifest and learn the secret of its origin in the starry heavens. Then, and then only, can we truthfully say " Whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder." Amen. There are vital occult laws of sex underlying the conjugal union that man scarcely dreams of as yet-laws which determine the



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 65
mental, moral and financial bias of the offspring which may be the outcome of that union. Each month, as the physiological lunar cycle is completed, the Soul sphere of the woman receives an influx of the life germs passing onward seeking. mate.rial incarnation. They each possess peculiar qualities to themselves; no two are exactly alike, though many may be similar. During the marital act, the exact mental and moral polarity of the parents strikes an instantaneous impression upon the embryonic Soul, which becomes indrawn within the fiery magnetic vortices of the sexual excitement. This impression gives definite traits and potentialities to the latent impersonal monad. To round out the apparently accidental polarity impressed upon it at the moment of its physical .conception within the mother's womb, requires a certain series of material environments as well as a certain series· of mental, moral and financial experiences. _At the same time, there is always a correspondence in nature between the polarity, with its consequent physical requirements and experience, and the latent impersonal Soul qualiti~s and their externalizing
possibilities. It is, however, quite unnecessary that the sen~uous qualities should externalize themselves in criminal form, and the fact that they do so· only shows the ignorance or depravity of the spiritual natures of parents. Any form of vice is only a clistorted image of some laudable quality. That is a fact to be



66 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
constantly borne in mind. The fact that the so-called animal nature of the present genera· tion is so generally depraved is nature's indisputable evidence that th14- human Soul, in its direct action upon the human organism, is out of focus. We must eaclJ, individually, attune our inner life-the higher self-until it can vibrate in unison with the external form. Pure love, pure thoughts, spiritual aspirations, and a complete image of a noble ideal in the mental sphere of both parents during the conjugal union will, if conception transpire, bring forth corresponding children, and they will become the living pictures of the parents' mental image. This is the secret for· the regeneration of the race. It is the one grand foundation for the practical and complete upliftment of humanity. This power is chiefly in woman's hands. Verily, only through the noble Soul of woman can man hope for redemption. . The first principle to be observed is that of triplicity. A person born under a fiery sign will always sympathi~e with those born under .similar signs; Such a fiery nature, to be happy, must be united to one of the same trigon, or its affinity. Hy affinity, we mean the next quality i:o it; for instance, air and fir~..agree. When a fiery sign rises upon the horizon, an airy' sign is always setting.. This western horizon is the seventh house, which rules love and marriage. · So, also, water and earth are in affinity with each other. Fire cannot burn without air.



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 6i
neither can water exist without earth.. At the same time, the perfect rapport is formed only by the same triplicity. Those born under the element of •water will find their most perfect counterpart with a similar sign rising, but fire and water, earth and air are the natural base of antagonism. . From the foregoing, the student can quickly see whom to love. The question as to when to consumate this love is denoted by the arcs of directions. Never court or marry when suffering from the rays of evil arcs. or disappointment will surely be the result, unless the horoscope is a strong one. But, when the Moon and Venus in the man's, or the Sun and Venus in the woman's, receive the friendly power of the planets, or the ascendant or mid-heaven, take mother nature's h.int, open the flood gates of your heart and let the Goddess in. · We must now consider the horoscope of birth. Should there be any planet within five degrees of the cusp of the seventh house, such a position will indicate the nature of the partner to marriage /Jui may not describe the personality. In so.me cases it will do this, especially if Venus or the Moon be so situated. The first thing to notice in the male natus is the position and power of Venus and the Moon.
If these be unaffli.cted then the native may hope for happiness in marriage, but if they are afflicted by Uranus, Saturn ·or Mars, then the .native i·s sure of a great deal of trouble in his



68 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
love affairs, and, if, in addition to this, one of the foregoing planets occupy the seventh he had better never get married, unless the horoscope of the intended wife has Jupiter strong in the same position. When benefics occupy .the seventh unafflicted, it is a sure indication of domestic harmony and, of course~ vice versa.
with this rare exception, viz., If only one malefic occupy the seventh, and he be strong and well aspected by the benefics, and the Sun or Moon, as the case may be, happiness may then result. But this peculiar com bi nation is not often found. For a female subs'titute the Sun for the Moon, and otherwise judge exactly on the same lines. When the Moon or Venus in a male natus, or the Sun and Venus (either one or both) be afflicted by Uranus, such a position indicates that some illicit connections will be formed either before or after marriage in the case of a fem·ale, and both before and after in the case of a male. 1\1 ars in the seventh signifies that the husba:nd or the wife will be hasty, jealous and passionate. Saturn in the seventh, that the partner in marriage will be cold, melancholy and sickly, or penurious and fretful. Jupiter in the seventh, indicates a most happy married life. Venus therein pre-signifies that the conjugal union will be pleasant, loving nod joyous, and that the partner will be graceful amiable· and courteous. When the Sun', and Venus in a female horoscope are configurated



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 69
with Jupiter, or Venus be in the same declination as the Sun much true love and consequent happiness is indicated, while the Moon and Venus in a male figure well aspected by Jupiter render the same conditions. As a general rule, the student must notice in a male natus what planet the Moon forms the first complete aspect with after birth, then the planet and the sign it occupies will indicate the condition of the future wife, that is the first
/iabitz:ty to marry. · If it be an evil aspect, it
should be avoided. If the Moon apply-closely to more than one planet a liability to more than one marriage is indicated, if the rest of the indications argue a plurality of wives, and the number of planets indicate the number of marriages. This, however, is only to. be considered when the Moon, having completed one aspect, is at the same time within the· orb of operation of the other. For instance, if the Moon be nine degrees from a sextile'Of Jupiter and seventeen degrees from the trine of Saturn, the native has two prospective wives unless indeed he is wise enough to be warned by his planets and refuse a second union. Such a combination implies that, the Moon apply• ing first to Jupiter, shows a noble, warmhearted woman and, a happy marriage, while the second, indicated by Saturn. would be cold natured, of reserved, repining disposition. Vice versa, if Saturn comes first, wisdom .would suggest passing .him by and waiting

To this we will add that if Satnrn afflict the. Moon by powerful aspect, death of the wife is indicated, and if wht"n the aspect is completed the Moon be in a double b0died sign, £. e., Gemini, Sagittarius and Pisces, the native will marry again. The planet Uranus afflicting the Moon indicates illicit connections and final separation, and if the lord of the seventh be afflicted, or a malefic be located in the seventh at the same time, divorce is certa1n to follow marriage. The same will hoid good in regard to a female by substituting the Sun for the Moon, in fact the very worst indi· cation in a lady's horo~cope is the affliction of the. Sun by Uranus, as they always become unfortunate in their love affairs unless counteracted by very strong benefic forces. We now offer a few words of advice regarding ~his most important subject. When a person's· natus indicates radical misfortune in the conjugal state, the wisest course is not to marry at all, as "one ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." Bu.t where the ev!!

is not radical, that is to say, where it is ca.used hy the mere acci'dental position of a malefic in the seventh house, then the native may masry aod Eve perfectly ha.ppy, if there an:: oth-::r good testimorfr::s; as if tlte partner shoi;H

The only way to counteract this radical evil of one horoscope is to become united to one whose nature, spiritual and magnetic, forms a perfect affinity of Soul fusion and whose horoscope in this direction contains nothing but
the good. But this rare jewel is ve'f'V, very hard to find.
A few words r.egarding offspring and we bring this section to a close. Solomon says that "there is a time to every purpose under the heavens," and this is especially so in the conception_of offspring. When good directions are operating in the wife's horoscope and other · conditions are equal is the time for such a sacred purpose. June, July and August are the finest months for conception, especially when the Sun is passing.through Cancer and Leo, viz., June twentieth to August twenty-first,
.and of all times about the tenth of July is best.

as the body is reinvigorated by rest. A child so conceived would be born with the Sun in Aries in its exaltation, the most vital condition possible as Aries r'ules the brain and upon this the solar influx is concentrated at this period, while at the moment of conception it was passing tqrough the heart, Leo, or the breast. giving the basis of love and human nature so much needed in the noble form of man.

CHAPTER VIII.
FRIENDS AND ENEMIES.
The constant expression of force which we term personal experience in the form of friendship and enmity, the sympathy and antipathy of people, is derived from the attractions and repulsions of our magnetic constitution. It is either electrical or magnetic according to the natural temperament of the individual. Similar natures are attracted to each other. In the case of man and woman, the magnetic fQrce of V~nus powerfully attracts the electricity ofMars and vice versa, so that if Mars in one of the horoscopes occupi~s the place of Venus in the other, mutual· love at first sight
almost is the sure resul~, and, as a- rule, such a couple would love each other until death separated them. Those born under the same triplicity. are in natural harmony, unless planets occupy the ascendant to interfere. For instance, suppose
QDe person be b~rn with Venus rising in Cancer, another with Saturn rising in the same place. These persons would not agree. . The nature of Venus would be unsuited to the nature of Saturn and this opposition or antipathy would· be still more strongly marked in influence if Mars and Saturn were so pitted .against each other.

contact and the natural effect produced on th!:'. odylic $phere i:; easily read. After\v3.rds, we become more or less polarized tc each other and the sensations are less defined.
In this connection, however, a serious err{lr is frequently made by most sensitives, an error all must earnestly strive to avoid. Merely because antipathy, or even repugnance, is experienced on first contact with a person, the conclusion that such person is evil-minded' or impure is not necessarily warranted. His nature may be a sounding board, from which our own selfishness oi: impurity is reflected hack to ourselves. Only after we have become thoroughly just within ourselves and are conscious of self purification and of the certainty that the Soul sphere wil'hin is clear and innocent, can we.absolutely trust our own sensitive sensations when coming in psychic rapport with others. The basis of all forms of friendship, (not merely personal, selfish or commercial interests) is.the interaction ofour planetary natures upon each other, so that two radically antagonistic natures, no matter how good and just they may be individually, can never truly hen-.



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 76
efit each other. They will differ in opinion, in taste and in their method of judgment, and, for all purposes in life, they are much better apart than together. Considered astrologically, the. eleventh house pre-signifies friends, the seventh house open or business opponents, the twelfth house the native's sorrow and his private secret foes. If a benefic occupy the eleventh unafflicted, it shows good and faithful friends. If benefics occupy the seventh and twelfth also unafflicted, it indicates that the native will have very few, if any, enemies of any kind. On the contrary; malefics posited therein indicate the exact reverse, and, the more afflicted they may be, th~ greater the evil arising therefrom. . _ The foregoing will prove true to some extent in every nativity' but must be acc~pted more as symbolical an·d apparent than radical and real. That is to say, planets so .situated symbolize those things, but everything· de
pends upon the real strength of the horos<:ope as a whole and upon the benefic power of the
luminaries. ·A really fortunate native will suffer very little ·from the mere fact that Saturn or Mars are located in the eleventh or twe1fth · house, unless they, at the same time, afflict the Sun and Moon. On the other hand, an unfortunate native with such a position might suffer severely. Malefics in the seventh, however, always possess very great power, no matter how fortunate. the native may other



76 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
wise be. For this reason they are angular and stand, sentinel like, as the evil genius over our matrimonial and domestic relations and business partnerships. Such a position creates misunderstandings between people and brings discord always. In all cases, the vital question as to the native's friends must be determined more or less by the luminaries. If these_ orbs be evilly placed and badly aspected, the native will possess but few friends in life and a great many enemies and this will be intensified if there be a malefic in one of the houses before mentioned, because it will then have a radical base to work on. When such is the case and the malefic occupying such house afflict the luminaries he becomes one of the most unfortunate of mortals. On the other hand, if.the Sun and Moon be oriental and well aspected and the benefics well elevated above the malefics the native will have but few foes and a host of helpful friends who will always be ready to aid and assist him. From personal experience, l have noticed that men who. have the Sun afflicted by Mars suffer very much from the criticism and slander of others, and that females who have the Moon so afflicted suffer in the same way; that Mars, when afflicting either luminary in a natus, gives much liability to criticism and slander, and further; that Saturn afflicting the lights, especially the ·Moon in a male or the



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 77
Sun in a female natus, indicates suffer.ing by or through friends, either from actual deceit or by being led astray through their association or advice. These are facts for the student to remember and carefully apply. In order to know the people with whom to associate in life, note the planet or planets which constitute the good in the horoscope, (even Saturn, Mars and Uranus are good if strong and quite unafflicted and at the same time well aspected,) choose such people as these good indications denote and, vice versa, avoid all that are symbolical of the evil of our nativity. \Ve possess the power to shun the evil and to choose the good, we need not associate with any nature which we know is detrimental to our life, health or interests. We ought to be sufficiently the master of ourselves to avoid being drifted with the current of social conventionalism into the society of those with whom we cannot possibly harmonize or generously agree without being false to our higher selves and indulging in pure cant for the sake of saying something polite. Remember that of all forces in the universe which concern human happiness and mental purity, the magnetism of our associates is the most potent in its effects upon our lives. The mental contagion of an impure mind or the personal poison that we 'receive from an impure Soul, cannot possibly be estimated at its· true signifi



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
cance. Some of the greatest crimes in the world have emanated from such contact. Mental poison corrupts g-ood morals, it warps sound judgment an·d often makes a complete wreck of life.



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
CHAPTER IX.
CELESTIAL DYNAMICS IN OPERATION.
When we consider the universal harmony of nature, the mutual dependence of all its various parts upon each other, and the continuous interaction of each atom upon each as units, and upon the whole, it becomes evident that there can be no such thing as accident or chance. There is no room within the divine economy, infinite as it is, for anything but one grand chain of sequences, the outcome of that divine One life termed Providence. All apparent accidents are the reactions of · preformulated ideas, all fortuitous chances ·are the natural lawful outcome of previously active forces set in motion in obedience to the internal laws of life, and their external appearances, strange at times though they seem, are the legitimate results swung into objective existence within the arc of the mighty pendulum of cause and effect. Nothing eventuates without cause, nothing transpires without effect, so likewise nothing can exist without fulfilling a set purpose within the divine scheme of creation. Hence, whatever is is good, is lawful, is in obedience to the creative fiat and is a part of God's providence. The .first "fatal step a metaphysician takes is also the last one, viz., a denial of objective .fact. The primary fundamental error of all



80 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
subsequent errors 1s made in the denial of the reality of physical expression upon the plane of physical life. There is an inconceivable difference between physical expression and physical cau·sation, for, as an abstract or metaphysical truth, there can be no such thing as physical causation, seeing that physical nature. as we understand objective phenomena to be. 1s but the reflection of subjective causes, differing in both quality and degree. But expres-;ion is one of the grandest facts o.f evolutionary life and to understand this phe-nomena, no
matter whether it represents a fuJl blown r~se or the sorrow and suffering of .. disease: .:we must first acknowledge its physical objecti.ve
reality.l•pon its owp plane of manife~tati~n:.~·.~..

are compelled to exe.rcise our varim~s func::tions.
It is a real thing no matter how transi~<?.f:Y and unreal it may be when viewed ·from_.,tl~e mterior plane of th.e Soul. · , . ·.
As a general rule (with a .fc;\V ~or·~~y ·!!~ ceptions), mental healers either igD.or~"or·jum ble together the two interacting and mu_tually dependent planes, the objecti"e and subjective. To be sure they assert that "all is good,"-~'there is no su.ch thing as evil," ''my trust. is. in the Lord," "the truth shall makeyou free," etc., etc.. ad infinitum, Qut in ninety-nine cases. ·out of every one hundred they are as blindly_ igno
rant of the spirit of .the. term~ they use in this



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 81
verbal cabala as is the poor Irish peasant when mumbling over his string of beads in an abominably mutilated Latin. Carefully examine these various statements: "There is no such thing as evil." True; but, if true, then there is no such thing as good. Why? Because we cannot know the one without the knowledge of the other; they are purely relative terms and can have no existence apart from each other. They are mutual interactions, or polar opposites. When evil ceases to be, good will become equally non-existent. ."All is good." Equally true; but is the real
meaning of this statement fully realized? As a rule, no, It is asserted as a mental factor in remov.ing sickness, endeavoring to implant it as a higher thought than the mental distortion · which produced the disease, whereas, this very. sickness is also good, in the strict meaning of this affirmation and its use, both :in the a·bstract and in the objective side of life. . There can be nothing that is not good. The v.ilest wretch that swelters in the very · hotbeds._ of vice is also good, because, he is there. He exists as· an objective expression of nature's. divine pn>Vidence; or he would not exist at all .. He is undergoing a very necessary experience for his peculiar. grade of de· velopment, an~ is the means of imparting, by example, a valuable experience to more ·reijned natures. Therefore, he is not only good,



82 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
but is also fulfilling the purposes of creative life. The assertion that his condition is only ;rn appearanci:- of mortal mind is only true when viewed from that abstract plane of life to whii::h he has not yet attained; therefore, such abstract thought cannot apply to him in his
present state. In the logic of metaphysics, th.e premise and con~lusion must occupy the same plane. So, assuming for the moment the position of mortHl mind, we are compelled to say that the most exalted saint and the purest,
noblest life of man, as typified in· the ideal Christ, was nothing (so far as earth is concerned) but mortal mind, a mere transitory appearance upon the objective plane of matter. As a fact, both; Judas and Christ are equally immortal in degree, the Christ spirit is still in our midst doing its work for humanity, and we are also surrounded by the spirit cf Judas :..nd rampant vice. "As it was yestert!ay, ,.~o it is today," and will continue so, by comparison, forever. Once more: "The truth shall make you free." True, 0 King; Amen. But, what i:~ truth? This question is addressed to strictly metaphysical thinkers, and not to those who would answer with some .worn out platitude. If the verbal mantrams, the .affirmations and the denials whi.ch are given out for the daily use of the weak, the blind and the sick, have any power, that power must come from an inward realization of the abstract spirit behind



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
the word or verbal expression, i.e., from a cons,cious recognition of the divine idea. To those who have realized the power of this latter statement, the question, "what is truth?" is addressed. In so far as the studies of the writer entitle him to speak with authority.. he can assert as very fact that there are but three expres- • sions to answer the question, viz:, I-I am, (this he knows). II-God is, (all creation asserts this) and !II-'-Evcry power andthinf! in creation
-is dual and dependent upon every other thing. This ends the conception of truth, more can only be added from appearance. The vital
truths, I am, God is, are the Alpha and Omega; but between these two poles the finite and the infinite, there rays forth all the inconceivable majestyof God's wondrous boundless universe. Creation upon Creation in one incomprehensible vista of fathomless eternities, each particular part of which is a representation of some special phase of nature's divine truth. The sooner therefore, recognition is taken of apparent truth, upon the plane of conscious knowledge, no matter what plane that may be, the sooner we shall place our lives, our real selves, en rapport with natural law within that degree of life. wherein providence has seen fit to place us. Good and evil, then, are real upon the plane of their expression, and are simply the phenomenal results of harmony and discord,



84: CE.LESTIAL DYNAMICS.
and these are different degrees of vibration. That statement is a/act which must be clearly remembered.
Sickness eventuates as the offspring of discord, as do sorrow. misfortune, etc., while per contra, health, wealth and happiness are the resultants of harmony. What can be more · simple to understand? The source of disease centers in the fact that the human organism is a medium pure and simple, a complex domain of many di
verse kingdoms, a state whose constituent parts are liable to .rebellion. The cause, per se, of disease is dual, either astro-magnetic or anima-magnetic,.die former are the reactions of the stars upon the vibrations of the odylic sphere, the latter, to which the great majority of sickness is due, are the reactions of personal
magnetism upon the electro~vital organism.· In the former case, the Sun, Moon and
planets, in their progressive m~tion, for·m various angles to the' radical po~itions they occupied at birth, when such angles constitute aspects, they produce external results in accordance with their radicat' nature, if the person's environment offers the necessary conditions. for reaction, if riot then they pass away in the embryo state, because· the times ·were not favorable for their manifestation. This is the secret of "arcs of direction," as they are termed. No arc of influence can possibly operate .uniess ·the surrounding conditions are suited,



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 85
to its physical expression. When ignorant of this, the latent astro causes draw man into those very circumstances that evolve the necessary environments for the influences to work out in full. Thus it is easy to overcome planetary influence by timely knowledge and wise action. The planets urge, predispose and influence, but they never compel us to given actions. From full recognition and appreciation of these facts it is easy to kriow when <lisease is lurking around us, and, forewarned by such knowledge, we can defy it to approach us. In the latter case-anima-magnetism-we are dependent to a large extent upon our ow_n intuitions, combined with a certam knowledge, that particular temperaments are discordant to us. It is only natural to avoid contact with such. When contrary magnetisms meet they not only clash, as do flint and steel, but they ignite and burn, slowly, but imperceptibly consuming the vitality of one or both natures, as the case may be. In some cases, where the opposite polarities are perfect, only the ne·gative subject suffers; the positive draws out and consumes the vital forces of the other until finally death supervenes. Thousands upon thousands of such cases transpire every year, especially among wrongly mated couples. We frequently see persons, hearty and healthy before marriage, droop and pine away afterwards; .vice-versa, sickly, delicate people revive and



86 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
get strong. Both cases are the outcome of the same universal law. There is no mortai mind h_ere, but, instead, there is a general tuning 11p of the physical constitution to the magnetic vibration~ of a more intense nature during the conjugal union. Nature is only reasserting her normal condition that was before latent in the t::xpres!'ion of fitful discord. Nothing but universal law prevails. Every·· thing is the logical sequence of Divine cause and physical effect. Self-deceive ourselves as we will in the fond hope of power from on high or from within, the vain repetition of meaningless words and stale, moss-grown platitudes will never realize it for us. Vibration alone can so attune our material organism that it shall beat in unison with the higher self, and constant effort, until we have strJJck the keynote of ourselves-until our words thrill forth the fuJI power of a quickened Soul, is the only sure and certain path to the grand at-one-ment. The astro-magnetic forces, then, are tl)e primary factors of external life, and vibration is the one grand law of celestial control.

CHAPTER X.
THE DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASE.
That a correct diagnosis of disease is of inestimable advantage to the psychic healer, mental or magnetic, no one can for a moment doubt, but that his diagnosis needs to bi:: the orthodox delineation of modern medical technicality no . true student of psychics will attempt to assert. By diagnosis, we do not mean the summary of symptoms classified under some medical term as representative of the disease or diseases thus signified, but we do mean an accurate perception of the radical causes of the pfiysical manifestation of the disease. Herein, then, we shall differ widely. from the modern medical practitioner who has graduated in the schools. To him, a c.ertain array of symptoms mean that the patient is suffering from a certain form of· disease, the name of which is very much the outcome of the fashion of the hour. The names of diseases to-day offer a marked and wide contrast to the names for the same afflictions a century ago; "the sore throat" of Queen Elizabeth's day became the influenza of the 18th century, today we call it "LaGrippe" (whatever that may mean). and alp10st any form of simple cold and dyspep.tic indisposition is attributed to the "Grippe,"



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
wherever that name is popular, and as soon as this medical dog has had its day some other equally absurd fad will be introduced as a lay figure upon which mankind can father their thousand and one ailments. Yet in all this time the same laws and the same eternal principals have been in operation and will continue to operate until the very crack of doom. The radical causes of disease have not changed and we will now proceed to lay down a few simple rules by means of which the radical nature and cause of the disease can be ascertained. But before doing so a few words in explanation seem necessary. It is not absolutely necessary to know the exact hour of a person's birth, (although a valuable thing when obtainable), the day of birth being quite sufficient, and as nearly every one knows the date of their birth, there will be very few cases indeed where these rules cannot be applied. I. Consult an astronomical ephemeris for the day and year of the patient's birth and mark down upon a piece of paper the exact longitude of the Sun, Moon and other planets as given therein, for noon. II. Examine the position and tabulate the aspects that may exist between the Sun and Moon and the planets. III. The existing malefic aspects, i.e., the evil aspects afflicting the luminaries, indicate the radical source of the patient's disease, and



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 89
the signs which the Sun and Moon and the afflicting planets occupy will correctly show the centers of the constitution from which the sickness proceeds. IV. If only one luminary is afflicted, ignore the position of the other. V. Count as many days after birth as the patient has completed years of lifo, and take the positions at noon on that day, as at birth, and examine the aspects existing between the two sets of positions. VI. If evil aspects prevail, as will generally be the case, note the signs from which the evil proceeds, and you have the secondary factors to complete your diagnosis of the case. VII. If the e\·il aspects are separating, and the luminaries are applying to good aspects, recovery will quickly follow with proper treatment. But if the reverse transpire, prepare yourself for a long fight over a stubborn case. We will now illustrate these rules in order to show the method of working in actual practice. Mr. X. is seriously ill, cannot leave· his bed, etc., etc.. He was born April 5th, 1860,. hour unknown. By reference to an ephemeris
for that date we find Sun in Aries Is degrees and 55 minutes; the Moon in Libra 10 degrees and six minutes; Saturn in Leo 19 ·degrees and 21 minutes, and Jupiter in Cancer 16 degrees and 18 minutes. These being all the factors in the case, we ignore the other aspects. To begin with, the student will here observe that



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
the luminaries are in sguar_e..·to e.ach other, showing a discordant interaction between the brain, indicated by Sun in Aries, and the kid
ne:ys, as shown by the Moon in Libra, As <i.
fact, the patien t was suffering from a severe nervous disorder, melancholia, etc., combined with kidney trouble; but there was also something else that all the medical science in the world would· have failed to diagnose, because hidden from sight. Counting thirty days, as the P.atient was fully thirty years old, which brings us to the 5th day of May, 1860, we !"<1.bulate again: Sun.in Taurus 15 degrees a~.--i ten minutes, Moon in Scorpio I 7 degree::; nnd 56 minutes, Saturn i~1 Leo H:l degrees and 42 minutes, Jupiter in Cancer 19 degrees and 49 minutes, while on this date we also find the Sun parallel to Saturn. Here we have Sun square Saturn in the birth position, while the Moon is in opposition to the Sun and square to Saturn, and this double affliction of Saturn by both luminaries indicates the real secret
/he Heart, shown. by Leo, and upon close inquiry we foμnd grief and love had been the first cause in the illneGs. St1mmarizing, v,re find the brain and heart are the two point5 requiring treatment; the recovery from the ki~ riey trouble and r,.·~:i-rnai derangement, shown by the M'oon in ·Scorpio, will naturally ensue when the primary factors are overcome. All cases are treated by the same method. the day of twenty-four hou'rs representing· one



CE.~.ESTlAL DYNAMICS. 91
year of iife is the cycie of solar motion that rules the life force of man. There is one exception only to this meth9d of diagnosis, viz., cases of sexual disease, the outcome of personal contagion during coition, And this class of diseases can never be treated successfully from the mental plane ·alone. This statement will be disputed, but the whole army of mental healers from Mrs. Eddy down tn the latest ::l!·d most accomplished and enthusiastic "scientist," as they are falsely ca iled, are chalte.ngcd to show ·a single case of true syphilitic poison that has been cured by purely mental treatment. It is readily admitted that medicines alone, without faith, are often powerless, hut this does not prove the lack of virtue in the med
icme. It only proves that medicine, to be really potent, mus~ be taken with conscious faith, this faith arousing into active life the various atoms which compose its active principles and endowing them with the power to attack and t~himately conqu~r the disease of those parts of the body with which the said atoms have a close astro affinity. So with mental treatment, unless the patient either believes or responds to the thought sent out towards him, the treatment is powerless for good..
It is important to know, next, whether the
disease is internal or ext~rnal, in other words, whether it is the astro-magnetic forces arou·s



!12 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
ing the buried larvre and tainted germs of old racial and heriditary diseases or whether it is the anima-magnetism of some external organism that the astro powers are making conditions for, i.e., the results of personal magnetism, mental and physical. This is very easy to determine. If a feeling of nausea is periodically or generally felt with the sensation of impending trouble, etc., etc.. in the solar plexus, then the sickness comes from some external person or entity, and requires corresponding treatment. Thus the student will perceive that there is nothing at all difficult in this system of diagnosis based upon the celestial dynamic forces of nature. Any person of average intelligence can understand it. Its real beauty and value consists in the fact that it presents a clear scientific system of procedure based upon universal law, while so far no law of any kind has been evolved in the ranks nf the mental scientists. Everyone has a way, a whim and a method of his own, consequently, cures in every case have been haphazard, not scientific nor commandable. The result of a perfect sympathy in vibration between the patient and healer. Their treatment and prayers did not avail one iota, ·but their magnetic vibrations did. They never guessed the secret of their real few successes, consequently they could not command the power at will as a scientist ought to do.



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 93
CHAPTER XI.
THE TREATMENT OF DISEASE.
We now a·pproach the grand arcana of this branch of Celestial Dynamics, viz., the treatment of disease, and therefore it behoves us
fo be. carefu) of any misunderstanding upon this very vital subject. In. the first p]ace the student must understand that ii: is not in accordance with either reason or human experience to sup.pose that - everyone can become a healer. ·Upon this very subject Saint Paul wise]y remarks: "Now concerning spiritual gifts I \VOuld not have you ignorant." (I. Cor. XII. 1.) This is exact1y our position. We would not have the student ignorant of the fact that, comparativeJy, very few possess the necessary . qualities for successfully practicing "the .healing art divine." The spiritu_al gifts here spoken of are'the Soul qualities; as expressed in the magnetic states of the human organism. They are attributes in reality, but . gifts by virtue of the fact that the possessor of such, has to render an account of such abilities in the world to come in proportion to his obliga
tions to humanity in this. In the ninth verse of the chapter already quoted, we. read " To another faith. by the same spirit, to another healing by the same spirit." Faith and heal



94 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
ing, you wi_H observe, are twin attributes and are, therefore, mentioned as the compliment of each other, This is as natural in Celestial Dynamics as green and red in art. Those who possess the power always possess the faith, the -one cannot exist without the other, they are polar opposites and metaphysically express themselves as cause and effect. . · The cause of. faith is the power to do, faith is the effect of the inward ability. But faith and imagination must not be confounde~, impressional natures can believe and imagine everything and yet possess no real basis, and .to imagine that everyone who studies mental
science is capabl~ of healing, is. about as absurd as to believe that everyone can becoine
an artist, a musician, a: mechanic or a philosopher. And yet, in spite of such a self-evident absurdity, alm·ost the first thing that the "scientist(?)"is requested to do after a preliminary instruction is to "treat.'' You might as well tell a man who has just learned the names and combinations of the various colors to paint a picture before he had studied the first princi·· pies of art, or .mastered· the elements of clrawing, shadfog, etc., not io mention background_, foreground, middle distance, etc., known only to actual artists. We. can easily imagine the
result. Why not apply~ this to the metaphysi· cal ·novice? .It is even more to the point than in the case of art. Of course, if real, natural talent'be present, the novice may astonish us



CELESTIAL DYNAM.ICS.
with an unexpected production in either ~ase, but if, as is most natural. failure is the result, the amateur artist can throw away his disfigured canvas with but little real loss, but the bad work of the mental operator Y{ill endure for ages, he has been handling the vital forces of life itself, and the vibrations he has consciously ·or unconsciously set in motion, are as far reaching as the universe itself, and will continue to bring forth fruit of some sort"or other.
If that fruit be the distorted reflections of rank ignorance, he has set humanity back so much, he has become a clog upon the wheels of progress a.nd must right the wrong sooner or later. "Verbum Sap." To be able to treat one's self is; perhaps, within the reach of nearly everyone, that is~ everyone of average intelligence and will ability. This is, indeed, a God-send and we ought to be truly thankful fQr it. To be able to heal others, or rather tapti/Jle of healing others:·we require three distinct attributes. 1st, a surplus
vitality; 2nd, c~mparative self control; 3rd, a
life generating magnetism. · To explain, we
require surplus vt."tatity, first, the vitality to give without robbing ourselves of the necessary for<;e to react completely from the treatment; second, self control to remain unmoved
by emotion in the presence ·Of sufferin~" so ·as to give forth a calm, steady, magnetic .light, a perfect m.ental picture to the diseased mind ,that .shall he sharp and clear in every outline;



96 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
(emotion acts upon the will like a draught upon the flame of a candle, the whole image is out of focus). Third, a life g-enerating- mag-netism to regalvanize the fading vibrations in the patient, hence the vital force of the healer must bejree from affliction at birth. These are the attributes of a healer, poss~ssing these he now requires two qualifications in the patient, or of him, viz., 1st, a fair general knowledge of his temperament and disease, and 2nd, an organism that is in direct or indirect sympathy with his own. The first explains itself, tlie second refers to the astral constitution. They must .not antagonize so that on an average, a duly qualified
healer will be able to cure so out of every 100
that apply to him. A person to tnat all will
fail in so no 91atter what his qualifications
may be, (remember we are now speaking of mental treatment only). Two skilled experts associated together, one born under the fiery trigon, the other under the watery, would. be able to treat and cure all cases between them. In addition ·to three natural attributes and the two external qualifications, the healer requires the two gifts which come only as the reward of honest labor and research, viz., 1st, knowledge of man; 2nd, common sense to apply such knowledge to the patient's advantage. These are the seven rules, master them all, at least in a great part, before you ever attempt ·~o remove the mote from your



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 97
brother's eye, lest, in your ignorance, you insert a beam in its place. Let not ·the student become dismayed at this array of necessary qualities and conditions. To all those who naturally possess the gift of healing, the training to acquire knowledge becomes a pleasure, and success is certain to follow. Just as the artist loves the dry mechanical details of painting, and the musician his laborious lessons and practice, as the necessary grading to their final triumph as master hands, so does the philosophical student, in his patient intellectual work, love all the trials that beset his path as so many stepping stones to perfect wisdom. The medical practitioner gives years of valuable time to the acquirement of knowledge; he has to devote untold hours to hard, dry study before he can honestly obtain. his diploma. So it is with the lawyer and the professional expert in every department of human knowledge if success is desired. Wisdom is the outcome of well directed intellectual work, and the mental healer cannot hope for success without the same years of study, physical culture, spiritual unfoldment and psychical research. There is no royal road; there is no secret of success that can be given in a formula or whispered in the ear. All true success is the outcome of well directed patient effort. You have now the basic foundation to start with. Work unceasingly to realize your



!18 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
mental ideal; give your highest thoughts an objective existence.
How TO TREAT.
This is our next consideration, and we shall presuppose that the healer answers to all the necessary conditions anq qualifications stated above. The human brain is the key··board to the musical instrument called man. When this instrument is. in tune, all is harmony; there is neither real sorrow nor actual disease. This is a fact, and all treatments based upon the natural law of Celestial Dynamics are conducted upon the principle of vibration exactly as the
musician wm tune his instrument by relaxing
or tightening one or more of the many strings. The organs of the brain, as classified by phrenology, are the strings or keys to the instrument, and through their medium, in part, can the mental imagery of the mind be reached. There are two methods of treatment, viz., mental and magnetic; both seek the same end; both operate in precisely the same way, and under the same procedure, and the practitioner will frequently find that a"lternating from the one to the other will produce better results. in less time than by either one alone; he.nee, both are recommended. The system of treatment resolves itself into one of contraction ·and expansion. The former is cold, con.tracting and suppressive,



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 9l>
the latter is hot, expansive and stimulating. This corresponds exactly to the tightening and relaxiug the strings of a musical instrument. In either case, an alteration in the vibration is sought and accomplished. The functions of the brain externalize themselves in the manifestation of mind, thought and in action. Therefore, everything we can think and every image in the mind, is. the outgrowth of some one or some particular group of organs, so that any sickness must have a point of contact in the brain just as everv organ in the body is the responsive medi'um of some group of organs in the brain. Remember these facts. The spleen is the human galvanic battery whose office it is to store up all surplus force, and also to receive and transl)1it' extra supplies of force when the organism is suffering from depletion. This is one of the most important factors in all the treatments. With these necessary explanations we now come to the actual treatment. Receive your patient cheerftilly and sympathetically. If you find his nature and temperament within the scope of your power, instantly assure him of a prompt and permanent relief. Stand your patient with his back to the light and place yourself a little to the left, immediately behind the patient. Then place the left hand upon the region of the spleen. The dress of the patient should be so arranged



100 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
as to admit the healer's hand to the region of the spleen, which is on the left side below the breast, and energize that organ into intense action, mentally directing your own life current through the left hand to the spleen. While this· is going on let the mind be exceedingly calm, positive and sympathetic. After about three minutes, never more than five, change the polarity of the mind from sympathy to one of lofty, imperious calm, replace the left hand upon the spleen and the right hand upon the brain, with the index finger immediately on the organ or group of organs from which the sickness comes, (if the disease is not functional but purely nervous, "credulity" and correlated organs must be operated upon to remove the belief and so destroy the image). While the hand remains. upon the organ formulate a clear, distinct picture of perfect health and freedom to suit the individual case. If the patient suffers from excessive .action of the organs, contract their force and reduce the vibrations by the contractive powers of cold, icy, death-like quiet over the organ, if from lack of power of any function, let the treatment be the opposite, viz., hot,· stimulating, fiery, active and f{"lowing- with intensity. This treatment may continue from five to not more than fifteen minutes. After this, let the patient be seated, and immediately in front, back to the healer,then give a general kind of healthy, noble, aspiring treatment, implanting _the



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 101
image of health and strength with an earnest aspiration to awaken the patient's $oul forces to a sense of their powers. and duty. Then it 1s over. \Ve have described the magnetic treatment. The mental treatment is exactly the same, except that it is purely mental. The healer closes his eyes, enters the silence until he can produce a perfect image of his patient. and, when this is done, he mentally performs exactly the same operations without the physical contact. But we recommend the first treatment to be magnetic for the sake of a more perfect rapport. It is useless to attempt to describe the kind of images to impress upon the brain in different cases. This must be left with the operator. Each individual has his own peculiar conceptions of truth, purity, health and beauty, an<l these will be more powerful to his mind than · the idea of any one else can possibly be. The great secret rests upon will ability on the part of the healer, and faith upon the part of the
patient. If these two combine in any perceptible degree, success will follow as naturally as day follows night.
WHEN TO TREAT.
This is the next important item. The word when is used as indicating the commencement of a case and riot the subsequent



102
treatments, much force.
CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
although even these Note these rules:
will have
I. Consult an ephemeris for the current year and note when the Moon forms a benefic aspect with the Sun or planet controlling the disease. Choose that day and time when the aspect .is in operation for the treatment, and let the succeeding treatments be given on those days when the Moon, by her motion, forms favorable aspects, which transpire every few days. The Moon has wonderful force upon the human brain, and, when benefic to the patient, success is much easier. II. When to refrain from treating. Whe11 the Moon applies to evil aspects, and, especially so, if she apply to malefic orbs, refrain. Appoint a day when the lunar force is benefic to the rulers of vitality or place of the benefics ori the day of birth. Further, if a sinking, sickening or faint feeling is experienced in the Solar Plexus- during treatment, immediately stop and appoint another time. If the same oi:curs for two or three times, refuse to treat altogether, as you cannot cure except at the expense of personal suffering, which is not just.



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 103
CHAPTER XII.
MAN· AND His MATERIAL DESTINY, ETC., ETC.
The true purpose of human embodiment is the aquisition of knowledge through experience, and man's incarnated destiny on earth · is the gradual expansion of the forces called and attracted during the past series of impersonal existences;. and the precise position, place, and status in society which he may occupy, be it that of the untutored African savage, but little above the brute, or the most cultured representative of modern civilization, is the exact environment that his nature requires for the expression of his incarnated entities. It is not the outcome of a past karma. It is not the result of previous human incarnation. For man, as we know him, never existed on this earth in the human organism before, nor will the same individual ever so exist m the future. The apparent suffering of individuals is
necessary discipline or it could not exist. There are no two souls exactly alike, they can and do exist as counterparts, but their experiences, at least up to a certain point, must of necessity be widely different in degree, and consequently, in effect. Each human being has a certain possibility of Free Will, that is to say a freedom of action and expression



104 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
absolutely their own, within certain limits, and these limits vary in each individuality. These limits constitute the latitude of the human organism and resemble the latitude of a planet in its orbit about the central Sun. It can wander north or south of its true ecliptic line. but only within certain bounds. Just so, man. he can by the exercise of his own will ability, ascend above the spheres and environments of birth until he reaches the highest point possible to his quality and capacity; or he may sink below such natal conditions until he reaches the lowest point beneath his true central line of life and the distance between these two points, North and South let u11 say, may be all the real difference externally between vice and virtue, wisdom and ignorance, wealth and want. And yet, notwithstanding their freedom of choice and physical expressio.n in its general outline, as shown in the human orbit from the cradle to the grave, it will be found to correspond in every particular part with the cosmic forces around which the Soul revolves while incarnated amid matter. Free will, in its limited functions, depends upon capacity, and capacity is the measure of human responsibility, while ability to express being dependant upon environment is the limit of his obligation. This then is the mystery of good and evil, of celestial cause and physical effect. The great groan of the uninitiated who



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. lOli
feel a strong sympathy for human suffering is, "what is the cause of so much error and pain" "how has this great difference between good and evil become manifest?" The answer is inevitable, simply because nature's end is diversity not equality, because nature needs to utilize every possible expression of his powers upon the earthy, both from heaven and hell, in order to round out the God-like being called man. He, the microcosm, born in heaven though dwelling in hell, allied to the Angels, yet possessing all the attributes of the Devil, needs conditions to express ·and space to fulfil the creative design. Every soul requires a certain amo"unt of suffering, no Soul is ever overdosed or gets more than its just requirements, and whether we require this suffering on this, or oi1 the other side of the grave is nature's own secret. She will see that our mission is fulfilled, nor can we escape ~rom prison until, like the debtor of the parable, we have paid opr account to the uttermost farthing. Such then is man's material destiny, a rendering of accounts, so to say, of experience and possibility in various realms of impersonal being and\ a complete expression of each atomic part in the completed organic whole, as we see it{o clearly and beautifully expressed in that mysterious temple, the human organism.



106 CELESTIAL DYNAMICS.
FR I END LY ADVICE TO STUDENTS.
We have now completed our course of study in Celestial Dynamics. You will doubtless have observed that, although we have endeavored to be simple in expression, it is one of the mightiest and most sublime of all studies, beause it treats of self, of man in his various relations to his fellow man and to God. Be not in any way dismayed at its magnitude. It is easy to learn if you follow this advice. Begin by mastering the primary lessons as taught in our little book, "The Language of the Stars." Commit the rules to memory; then study in a systematic manner, "The Light of Egypt," which will place you in the second grade and prepare you for this fuller normal course. When you have done this, the present series will be both pleasant to read. and easy to fully understand. · In all treatments of disease remember . that diseases of contagious virus must be met by the proper medical remedies of a physical nature, in addition to the mental and magnetic method described, This will ensure success. There is no reason for any metaphysician to radically alter his method of treatment. They can each and all gradually combine the two and notice results. What we have especially aimed at is to reduce chaos to order. to bring . experiment and haphazard treatment to a clearly defined system of procedure, so that



CELESTIAL DYNAMICS. 107
the healer may set to work in a thoroughly systematic manner, and treat scienti"fically on a natural basis. For, so far, so-called mental science has been woefully deficient in this respect. We have attempted to relegate Mrs. Eddy's mortal mind to the limbo it merits, for if our bodies are mortal mind when viewed from a higher plane, so is that higher plane itself mortal mind when we reach it, viewed from a still higher plane. In fact, mortal min is as much the mind of God as anything else. All creation in every phase is but the crystallized form of the Deific idea. Therefore, "read, mark, learn and inwardly digest" these great principles. Our own mission on this plane will soon be completed, and it is our most sincere desire that in leaving the things of earth, we shall at least have been instrumental in making some of its inhabitants
wiser and better than we found them. It is the sacred duty of all whose lives have acquired truth, to impart that truth to others whenever they are fitted to receive. Thus we have given our atom which may help to swell the sum total which others already possess..
