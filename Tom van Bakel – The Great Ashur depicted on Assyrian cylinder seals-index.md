The Great Ashur depicted on Assyrian cylinder seals
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashur_%28god%29
This Neo-Assyrian relief represents Ashur, head of the Assyrian pantheon:
‘Ashur is the head of the Assyrian pantheon. As such, Ashur did not originally have a family, but as the cult came under southern Mesopotamian influence he came to be regarded as the Assyrian equivalent of Enlil and in time Ashur absorbed Enlil's wife Ninlil and his sons Ninurta and Zababa.’
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashur_(god)
He was the divine father of humanity and it is obvious that many Assyrian kings were named after him:
Puzur-Ashur I fl. ca. 1975 BC Ashur-nirari I 1547 - 1522 BC (26 years) ‘son of Ishme-Dagan II’ Puzur-Ashur III 1521-1498 BC ‘son of Ashur-nirari (I)’ Ashur-shaduni circa 1471 BC (1 month) ‘son of Nur-ili’ Ashur-rabi I circa 1470 - 1451 BC (uncertain, damaged text) ‘son of Enlil-nasir (I)’ Ashur-nadin-ahhe I circa 1450 - 1431 (uncertain, damaged text) ‘son of Ashur-rabi (I)’ Enlil-nasir II ca. 1430–1425 BC Ashur-nirari II ca. 1424–1418 BC ‘son of Enlil-nasir (II)’ Ashur-bel-nisheshu ca. 1417–1409 BC ‘son of Ashur-nirari (II)’ Ashur-rim-nisheshu ca. 1408–1401 BC ‘son of Ashur-bel-nisheshu’ Ashur-nadin-ahhe II ca. 1400–1391 BC ‘son of Ashur-rim-nisheshu’ Ashur-nirari II ca. 1424–1418 BC ‘son of Enlil-nasir (II)’ Ashur-bel-nisheshu ca. 1417–1409 BC ‘son of Ashur-nirari (II)’ Ashur-rim-nisheshu ca. 1408–1401 BC ‘son of Ashur-bel-nisheshu’ Ashur-nadin-ahhe II ca. 1400–1391 BC ‘son of Ashur-rim-nisheshu’

Ancient Near Eastern Cylinder Seals from the Marcopoli Collection no 551 by Beatrice Teissier Syrian cylinder seal (Ca.1850-1720 BC
As such, Ashur did not originally have a family:
‘Ashur is the head of the Assyrian pantheon. As such, Ashur did not originally have a family.’
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashur_(god)
This meant that when he created humans he was father and mother at the same time: on the above imprint his dual character was made visible by giving the eagle (Ashur) two heads.
He holds two boys which symbolizes that he brings life to the people just like Ningublaga:
1-4. The lord, a furious angry storm against the enemy, ......, strong ......, my lord who brings life to the people, whose own father ......, a great storm, a mighty raring ......, has ...... -- the lord whose manliness is impressively strong, ......!
adab to Ningublaga for Iddin-Dagan (Iddin-Dagan C)
These two naked boys symbolize that he twice gives life to a human: when he creates him and when he gives him birth.
On this imprint of a Neo-Assyrian cylinder seal an Ashur eagle holds two seated humans who undoubtedly represent the owner of the seal. Although the humans are mature this scene also symbolizes that Ashur twice gives life to this seal owner: when he creates him and when he gives him birth.
A. 46. Aigle à tête humaine de profil (?), aux ailes éployées,entre un dieu et une déessevêtus de châles à rayures verticales enroulés en forme de jupon, assis celle-ci sur un siège cubique, celui-là surun tabouret à pieds croisés. Le dieu semble porter la main droite à la ceinture et abaisse le bras gauche en avant; la déesse étend l'avantbras gauche et élève le bras droit. Au revers du de quatre losanges superposés, avec un globe au milieu de chacun. Époque archaïque. — Marbre vert.- 28 X 17 mm. — Inv.: AO 4764 (Acquisen 1911). Planche 65,fig.5. A. 47.



On this imprint Ashur, again depicted as an eagle, grasps in its talons two children and bring them to the people. These two children are the sun god Shamash, who is indicated by two dots symbolizing his number: 20, and the storm god Ishkur/Adad, who is indicated by one dot, which symbolizes his number: 10.
Some cylinder seals are decorated with so-called ‘drill holes.’ These holes represent numbers: one hole represents number 10 and two holes represent number 20. These numbers on their turn are related to deities: number 10 to the storm god Ishkur/Adad and number 20 to the sun god Utu/Shamash:
Male: 60 - Anu, 50 -Enlil, 40 - Ea/Enki, 30 - Nanna/Suen, 20 - Utu/Shamash, 10 Ishkur/Adad
Female: 55 - Antu, 4.5 - Ninlil, 35 - Ninki, 25 -Ningal, 15 - Inanna/Ishtar, 5 – Ninhursag
h ttp://www.rulit.net/books/the-12th-planet-read-299421-25.html
This means that Ashur recreates the deities Shamash and Ishkur/Adad, who are probably reborn at new year. The two sheep below may represent the owner of the seal. He is represented by two sheep as he may have been born in Aries.
This may have been the first reason why humans were depicted like sheep.

Ancient Near Eastern Cylinder Seals From The Marcopolic Collection No 62
On this Old Syrian seal (ca.1720–1650 B.C.) an eagle grasps in its talons two sheep. Again, this scene symbolizes that Ashur twice give life to the seal owner: first during his conception and then during his birth.
This owner of the seal was depicted as a sheep because the Ancient Near East kings where called: ‘shepherds’:
‘I, the king, was a hero already in the womb; I, Šulgi, was born to be a mighty man. I am a fiercelooking lion, begotten by a dragon. I am the king of the four regions; I am the herdsman and shepherd of the black-headed people. I am a respected one, the god of all the lands’.
A praise poem of Šulgi (Šulgi A): c.2.4.2.01
And the ordinary black-headed people, like this seal owner, were like sheep:
‘He promised him that he will be a man of pre-eminent kingship! He promised him that he will be a king whose reign is good! He promised him that he shall have the people inhabit safe dwellings! Enlil found agreement in what he had said to the numerous people! On the day for decreeing fates, every part of Sumer and Akkad, among the black-headed people flocking like sheep, among their well-tended people, will praise forever the majesty of the Great Mountain Nunamnir, enkar weapon of the universe! It is his awe-inspiring way!’
The lament for Nibru: c.2.2.4
This may have been the second reason why humans were depicted like sheep.



On this Syrian cylinder seal (Ca.1850-1720 BC) a double headed eagle holds two sheep. Once again, this scene symbolizes that Ashur creates and gives birth to a human, the owner of the seal.
This seal owner was depicted like a sheep which may have showed that he regarded himself as a warrior, as a battering a ram just like Išme-Dagan did in a praise poem:
‘Išme-Dagan, born for heaven, chosen by the heart (-) I am a belligerent wild bull, kicking up the dust everywhere; I am a battering ram, ....... I stand in the forefront of the shields.’
Praise poem of Išme-Dagan (Išme-Dagan A + V): c.2.5.4.01:
This may have been the third reason why a human was depicted like a sheep.
The child holding a spear may be a god like Ninurta. He is a divine son of Ashur and on the battlefield may be the helper of the seal owner. He may also spread out in heaps and with the king he may celebrate holy purification rites of E-kur, serving daily.
‘The lord who has the decisions of heaven and earth in his hands, the Great Mountain Enlil, has made the king's fame extend as far as the boundaries of heaven: ‘Ur-Ninurta! In authority and youthfulness may your neck be as fat as a wild bull's. Like the warrior Erra, ......, may my avenging son, Lord Ninurta, a furious storm against the enemy, be your helper on the battlefield, and may you put your trust in him. ...... the enemy land, and may he spread out in heaps for me ....... The holy purification rites of E-kur ......, serving daily. May your offerings on the august table in my great dining hall be everlasting. May you lift your head and raise your neck to the heavens. Life is yours, irrevocably.’

On this Syrian cylinder seal (Ca.1850-1720 BC) a double headed eagle brings down two sheep, which symbolizes that Ashur creates and gives birth to a human: the seal owner. This owner of the seal is depicted as a sheep because he may regard himself as a star just like Šulgi:
‘Before Utu son of Ningal, I, Šulgi, declare that in my long life in which I have achieved great things since the day that my kingly destiny was determined, in my life in which everything was richly provided in contentment, I have never lacked anything. Until the distant future may this song bless the name of me, the king, with a life of long days. As I am musical, as I am eloquent, I am a heavenly star of steadfastness. It is an awe-inspiring brow that establishes palaces, just as a peg and a measuring cord are the builders of cities. With the awesomeness that radiates from my forehead, which I make the foreign lands wear like a nose-rope, and the fear-inspiring lustre, my personal weapon, which I impose on the Land like a neck-stock, I am able to root out and undo crime. I have the ability to reconcile great matters with one word’.
A praise poem of Šulgi (Šulgi B): c.2.4.2.02
And in Akkad ‘sheep’ symbolized planets or ‘traveling’ stars:
‘In the Ancient Near East it symbolized a planet: ‘Planet’ can be met in three forms: dUDU.IDIM, MULUDU.IDIM or MULbi-ib-bu. UDU.IDIM, Akkadian bibbu in itself means ‘wild sheep’; while fixed stars are a peacefully pasturing flock, planets as ‘traveling’ stars are wild sheep or even beasts lurking for sheep.’ (Hommel 1909: 217).’

This may have been the fourth reason why a human was depicted like a sheep.

On this Syrian cylinder seal (Ca.1850-1720 BC) an eagle brings down two sheep, which symbolizes that Ashur creates and gives birth to a human. Ashur may have created him in June and may have given him birth in March.
In Rome ‘June is known for the large number of marriages that occur over the course of the month. According to one etymology, June is named after Juno. Juno was the goddess of marriage and a married couple's household, so some consider it good luck to be married in this month.’
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June
In June the goddesses Juno and Flora ‘created’ Mars: ‘Flora obtained a magic flower and tested it on a heifer who became fecund at once. She then plucked a flower ritually using her thumb, touched Juno's belly, and impregnated her.’ Mars ‘created’ in June is born in March which is named after him: ‘In the earliest Roman calendar, March was the first month, and Mars would have been born with New Year.’
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_(mythology)
Similar to this Roman myth in Mesopotamia deities like Inanna and Ninurta were recreated in June and reborn in March, when a new year started.

Birds of prey bringing life on earth
Egyptian Iconography on Syro-Palestinian Cylinder Seals of the Middle Bronze ge by Beatrice Teissier no. 2g
On this Egyptian picture a falcon and a vulture hold two ankh signs symbolizing the acts of conception and birth:
‘The ankh appears frequently in Egyptian tomb paintings and other art, often at the fingertips of a god or goddess in images that represent the deities of the afterlife conferring the gift of life on the dead person's mummy; this is thought to symbolize the act of conception.’
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankh
Egyptian Iconography on Syro-Palestinian Cylinder Seals of the Middle Bronze Age by Beatrice Teissier no 176
The Egyptian scene symbolizes the act of conception afterlife but the two eagles (?) holding an ankh sign on this Syrian-Palestinian cylinder seal symbolize the act of conception before life. In other words: they symbolize that deities or humans are created and born. On the drawing these two eagles (?) may represent Ashur.

This Graeco-Persian seal (Achaemenid period ca. 600-500 B.C.) seal shows Ahura Mazda with outstretched wings. He is a creating god just like Ashur and Enlil.
o An eagle (Ahura Mazda) grasping in its talons a little eagle, symbolizes the act of conception. It shows that a king is created (Persian kings are personified by an eagle.)
http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/derafs
o And a foal suckling a mare, symbolizes the period of birth and suckling of the king. Apparently a king calls himself a horse just like Šulgi does:
‘I am a mule, most suitable for the road. I am a horse, whose tail waves on the highway. I am a stallion of Šakkan, eager to run.’

http://www.themorgan.org/collections/collectionsEnlarge.asp?id=623 (Early Dynastic III period, ca. 2600–2334 B.C.)
In the lower register of this Mesopotamian cylinder seal an eagle grasps in its talons two sheep, which symbolizes the acts of conception and birth: Ashur, depicted as an eagle, creates a human who may have called himself a batting ram like Išme-Dagan did in his praise poem (see above). A god like Ninurta, the divine son of Ashur, is standing between the two sheep. He may be a helper on the battlefield.
In the upper register two gods (probably Ashur and his wife Mullissu) are drinking while the divine son of Ashur and the seal owner, both depicted like children, serve them. This scene clearly show that in Assyria humans are is created to provide food and clothes for the gods as we can read in the debate between Grain and Sheep:
‘In order to provide cattle and grain for the earth, at the suggestion of Enki, the Babylonian Ea, the god of wisdom, Enlil creates two minor deities, Lahar, the cattle-god, and Ashman, the graingoddess, to provide food and clothes for the gods. The myth describes the abundance which they create upon earth; but they drink wine and get drunk and begin to quarrel, neglecting their duties, so that the gods are unable to obtain what they need. In order to remedy this situation man is created.’
Middle Eastern Mythology By S.H. Hooke



Sumerian cylinder seal (Early Dynasty III a ca 2600-2500 B.C.)
Ashur, depicted as an eagle, holds two sheep which symbolizes that he brings life to the people. The two sheep may represent a god like Ninurta and the owner of the seal, and the lion may represent a goddess like Inanna, a divine daughter of Ashur:
‘Great light, heavenly lioness, always speaking words of assent! Inanna, great light, lioness of heaven, who always speaks words of assent! Ninegala!’
A hymn to Inana as Ninegala (Inana D)
Ashur may have given her as a helper to the seal owner, just like Enlil gave her to Šu-Suen:
‘Head held high, fit for the royal crown, son of Ninsumun, mighty and forceful among the Anuna gods ....... Šu-Suen! Holy Inana made manifest ....... Enlil has given to you as your helper the beloved heart whose beauty is unending, the good woman ...... -- you have embraced her.
Strong one given majestic strength by the Great Mountain, ...... from his power; hero excelling all lords and sovereigns, who is their great lion -- Šu-Suen, gracious figure, shining crown, holy breast wondrous to behold, hero born for godhood, ornament of kingship, ...... in heaven and on earth, strong as far as the borders of the Land!’
A hymn for Šu-Suen
Together with his divine brother and sister the seal owner may work on the fields:
I returned ...... to Urim. I made ...... return (?) to his country ...... like ....... I loaded its grain on barges, I delivered it to its storehouses. I returned its ...... citizens to their (?) homes. I ...... their earth-baskets. I ...... the savage hands of the Gutians, the ....... After I had made the evil-doers return (?) to their ......, I restored (?) the walls that had been torn down; my outstanding mind ....... ...... the shrine of Urim ....... I am the foremost workman (?) of Enlil; I am the one who ...... food offerings.
A praise poem of Ur-Namma (Ur-Namma C)
And then they may make offering for Ashur like Nanna-Suen does for Enlil:
‘Rejoicing, the porter rejoicing, the porter rejoicing opened the house. Kalkal, the doorkeeper, rejoicing, the porter rejoicing opened the house. Kalkal, in charge of the bolt-handle, rejoicing, the porter rejoicing opened the house. At the house of Enlil, ......, Nanna-Suen made the offerings. Enlil, rejoicing over the offerings, offered bread to Suen, his son’.
Nanna-Suen's journey to Nibru



British Museum AN1131102001
On this cylinder seal from Ur, (Pit X, 9-10m. 2600BC Early Dynastic III) an eagle grasps in its talons two rams, which symbolizes the act of conception and the act of birth in Aries. Ashur creates a human who may call himself a ‘battering ram’.
In the upper register of this seal only two deities (probably Ashur and his wife Mullissu) are drinking. Although there are no servants this scene may suggests that the seal owner will serve his divine parents.
All in all: Ashur, the head of the Assyrian pantheon, is the divine father of deities and humans. He gives life twice: during the conception and during the birth of his children. These children serve him when they are mature.
