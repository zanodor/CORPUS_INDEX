Preface
The sky has been a source of great fascination to human beings over all times. It can
be quite confidently asserted that this fascination began quite early, with evidence
left behind by ancient man. Even today, sky observation programmes are probably
the most popular of science programmes and astronomy lectures in general attract
the most audience.
Yet the origin of astronomy is shrouded in mystery. The roots of mankind’s
interest in the sky probably stemmed from the anxieties of early farmers about the
rains or in idle observations of patterns in the sky or even in early travellers trying to
keep track of directions in their long wanderings.
Whatever the origin of the subject, it has fundamentally altered our attitude to
ourselves and our engagement with the world around us. From naming planets, stars
and visualising patterns in the sky made by joining the dots of stars, we have played
with the images of the skies.
The skies in turn have also not disappointed us. From cloud, thunder,
lightning and rains, the skies have always put on for us a variety of shows. Also
providing us with clocks that range from minutes to years and millennia, and annual
rains that make life possible on earth, skies have been a crucial part to human
existence.
Yet, how did humans learn to keep track of the skies and follow them over
time? In the present book we have tried to summarise our perspective on how
human interest in skies might have evolved.
This book aims to provide a phenomenological overview of the growth of our
understanding of astronomy. It does not provide technical details of how to measure
locations of stars and planets or details of astronomical records in Sanskrit literature,
something that has been done much better by other more competent authors. Prof.
R. N. Iyengar (2013) has meticulously recorded astronomical references in ancient
Sanskrit texts and authors such as Prof. S. Balachandra Rao have deciphered the
ancient methods of calculations to keep track of stars. Prof. K. Ramasubramanian
and his team have meticulously detailed the theoretical developments in Siddhantic

astronomy and authors like Dr. K. D. Abhyankar, Dr. K. Shailaja and Dr. N.
Ratnashree have worked on temples and other monuments that stand as tributes to
our ancestors’ interest in astronomy.
This book is only designed to give a flavour of the flights of imagination and
creativity that must have been the bedrock of ancient astronomical studies. This
book we hope will excite the imagination of the reader to give more thought to the
manner in which humans must have perceived and studied the heavens since time
immemorial.
This book would not have been written without the support of our friends and
colleagues who probed us with questions, listened to our answers and made us think
more and more on the subject. A lot of work discussed here would not have been
possible without the help of Jamsetji Tata Trust. We would like to thank Prof. S. M.
Chitre who not only challenged us but also provided us with support. We also want to
thank Dr. A. P. Jamkhedkar, Dr. Vasant Shinde, Dr. B. V. Subbarayappa, Dr. Aniket
Sule, Mr. Parag Mahajani, Mr. Hrishikesh Joglekar, Dr. Sudha Bhujle and Dr.
Bhagyashree Tarde with whom we had many exciting discussions. We would also
like to thank Mr. Kishore Menon and Mr. V. Nandagopal who provided some crucial
stimuli by organising a whole series of sky observation programmes where a lot of
questions discussed here were raised. We cannot under estimate the crucial
freedom and support provided by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in
terms of funds and intellectual stimulus for this study.
Mayank Vahia would like to acknowledge the support of his family, wife Neeta
and two daughters Mimansa and Durva, who happily joined him in many excursions
and who periodically kept demanding that he explain some subtle aspect of
astronomy to them.
Nisha Yadav would like to thank her parents and all family members for
wholeheartedly supporting her in her pursuits.
Srikumar M. Menon would like to thank all his friends at The Astronomy Club,
Manipal for sharing in the appreciation of the wonders of the night sky over the
years.

We also thank all other friends whose names we may have inadvertently
missed.

1. Evolution of Human Understanding of Astronomy
The heavens have fascinated human beings from the earliest periods. Though today
we can divide the study of heavens into several levels such as the atmosphere, the
near-earth sky, the solar system, objects within our Milky Way Galaxy and its
neighbourhood and the large scale structure of the universe, this is a recent
phenomenon in human history. This hierarchical view of the structures that populate
our cosmos is not more than 400 years old. Until recently, everything that was not
terrestrial was called astronomical. In fact the most spectacular aspects of this
realisation are barely a century old.
But the night sky has had a profound effect on humans. It has fascinated
artists, poets, and all kinds of romantics by its sheer beauty. As the sky and what
falls from it is crucial to life on earth, humans have been fascinated and terrified by
the forces of nature that originate in the sky and have unpredictable behaviour.
These natural forces, with their own sense of timing have been held precious by
humans in all civilisations. Plants spring out from the earth when rains from the sky
make her fertile. This simile to human life cycle has given rise to the idea of Mother
Earth and Father Sky in all civilisations. Eventually these skies become heavens and
the abode of gods who manifest and control these forces. All myths lead to the gods
in the heavens, watching over humans and blessing them or cursing them as the
case may be. From time immemorial, humans have looked at heavens as the place
where all sacrifices must be sent and where all penance for sins must be addressed.
Super-humans have resided and controlled heavens in all the civilisations. Similar
rock art is seen in many civilisations. Heavens, therefore, have been the playground
of shamans, priests and philosophers. The fact that the night sky provides a
spectacular vision only helps create a sense of mystery. Many civilisations have also
seen, in the dotted patterns of the sky, a sketch of important events and heroes in
the skies.
From the very early times, humans have realised the similarity of rains from
the sky and the resultant growth of life around them, and the manner in which they
themselves reproduce. So Mother Earth and Father Sky form one of the earliest
symbolisms of human art. Miniature female figurines in mammoth-ivory have been
discovered in the basal Aurignacian deposit at Hohle Fels Cave in the Swabian Jura



7
of south western Germany recently (Conard 2009) but the earliest example of human
abstract art in Africa dates back to 75,000 years ago (Henshilwood 2002). In early
farming cultures the goddesses tend to dominate the mythology and only over a
period of time does the gender of the principal gods changes.
The study of the heavens has had another profound consequence. It has
taught mankind science and given us the stepping stones of scientific work including
systematic observation, correlation, long-term follow up and objective analysis in a
manner that no other pursuit of human study has done. Humans seem to have
understood very early that the seasons are related to a whole host of events that
happen in the heavens well beyond their control. From clouds, rains, thunder and
lightning to the movement of the Sun and the Moon, all seem to have a profound
effect on their lives. From there it took a little longer for the humans to come up with
the idea that the heavens could possibly affect their individual life in a direct manner.
Fortune telling is still called astrology even though it contains a whole set of other
belief systems. Respect for and fear of the heavens is probably as old as the oldest
human cultures1.
Astronomy introduced the ideas of linking movement of objects in the sky and
seasons on the earth. So how did humans gather and evolve their ideas of
astronomy from the first stages of their evolution of understanding? We meander
through a scenario of how this could have happened. This may or may not be the
exact path, but it makes a fascinating possibility.
Before we begin the story of astronomy, let us briefly look at the steps in
human evolution and then look at its relation to astronomy.
Human beings have gone through various stages of evolution. Homo Erectus
who evolved around 1.5 million years ago, were around till about 150,000 years and
invented the technology of controlled fire, and our close cousins the Neanderthals
existed until about 30,000 BCE and probably crossbred with Homo Sapiens Sapiens,
the modern humans. Stages of human evolution are identified as Palaeolithic,
Mesolithic and Neolithic. The prehistoric ages date back to the Palaeolithic (Early
1In terms of human growth, it seems that the appreciation of skies is much later than appreciation of landscape. This is probably related to the expansion of human comprehension of the third dimension (see e.g. Vahia, 2014, p.3).

Stone) Age, which lasted from the first appearance of humans to the end of the last
Ice Age around 10,000 BCE.
The last ice age began about 125,000 years ago. Conventional wisdom has it
that, at the end of it, somewhere between sixty and seventy thousand years ago,
humans began migrating out of central Africa (probably in present day Ethiopia) and
moving North and East spread to southern Africa and all over Austro–Asia and
Europe. They took a few thousand years more to move into the American continents
from Australia, going first to South America and then moving up north. The Last
Glacial Maximum (when the Earth’s ice cover extended to mid-latitudes) occurred
around 15,000 BCE. Between 15,000 BCE and 5,000 BCE, most of the world’s
glaciers melted (Kopp et al., 2009). This created new habitable land, while the sea
reclaimed former beaches and even valleys. Massive earthquakes and volcanic
activity also resulted in some great upheavals around the world.
Myths of great floods occur in many of the world’s cultures. Today, by
examining sediment deposits and other clues, geologists have identified three
occasions during the end of the Ice Age when massive ocean floods occurred in
different parts of the world: approximately 15,000 years, 11,000 years, and 8,000
years ago.
Cave paintings in a few parts of the world date back to 17,000 years, notably
the cave paintings at Lascaux, Altamira etc. in Europe, as well as some lesser
known sites around the world. These caves were in use as early as 17,000 years
ago2. At that time, ice from the last Ice Age was receding. The paintings even depict
penguin-like birds called auks, pointing to the colder Mediterranean climate of the
receding Ice Age. Interestingly, there has been speculation about representation of
astronomical phenomena in this painting - the line of dots under the sketch of a
horse is thought to represent the phases of the Moon. These could be the world’s
oldest known ephemeris – a lunar ephemeris. Later bone engravings found in
Blanchard, France also show phases of the Moon as a winding string of dots. Other
paintings in the Lascaux Caves show sequences of dots and possible ideograms.
For example, there are 14 dots in a circle with another dot in the centre that might

have marked the Lunar Month. Even at other places in the world, such as Andaman
and Nicobar islands, humans were recording the seasons.
As early as the transition from the Palaeolithic Age to the Mesolithic Age
(Middle Stone Age) around 13,000–11,000 years ago, human were beginning to
domesticate animals and leading a relatively more settled life, from nomadic hunter
gatherers eventually settling down in permanent habitation. In evolutionary terms,
human love for a patch of space is a recent idea probably no more than 10,000
years old.
During late Mesolithic Age the human capabilities rose to a higher level and
this period is called Neolithic or New Stone Age, which spanned approximately
10,000–7,500 years ago. During the Neolithic Age, humans began to grow crops of
plants. This meant an end to a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle. To live near crops,
humans had to build homes. These homes were often built together in villages.
From Palaeolithic to Neolithic times, humans used stone tools. In the following
ages, humans learned to work with metals to make tools and weapons useful in
hunting, agriculture, and war. The easiest metal to work was the pliable copper with
its low melting temperature. In the Chalcolithic Age (Copper Age), 7,500–5,000 years
ago, humans began to make tools from copper. The use of copper also encouraged
trade for copper (and later other metals and precious stones). This sent traders
travelling far and wide. Expanding trade brought distant cultures in contact with each
other throughout Europe, Asia Minor, and Africa. This trade also might have brought
rise to early writing. Some of the earliest writing on clay tablets in Mesopotamia are
Sumerian accounting records.
In this book, we will refer to these early observers of the night sky as
astronomers, though the astronomy they practiced was very different to the
“scientific astronomy” of professional astronomers today, and much more tied up to
cultural practices. They observed that the planets moved relative to the stars.
Ancient astronomers recorded positions of the planets relative to the stars. The
brightest stars were the easiest to spot. Stars of the first magnitude have been used
to keep track of the sky since at least the days of ancient Babylon and probably long
before that. Some of these stars are Aldebaran, Antares, Pollux, Regulus, and Spica.



10
The Babylonians and others recorded two of these stars, Aldebaran (in Taurus) and
Antares (in Scorpius), as exactly opposite each other in the sky and in the centre of
the constellations that comprise their respective signs. They also recorded Spica (in
Virgo). Similarly, in the ancient Indian literature references can be found to
Saptarashi in Rig Veda along with Kritika, Magha, Ashlesha, Swati etc. elsewhere
(Filliozat 1962).
Our ancestors pondered about the motions of the heavens. They may have
wondered what the stars and planets could be. Several ancient societies discovered
the cycles of motion of the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars. They must have made
these observations over many generations. Some of them recorded astronomical
observations so accurately that they were able to predict eclipses of the Sun and
Moon.
Next, we try to recreate the scenario of the development of human romance
with heavens. From the beginning, Humans observed that the earth flowers and
gives food after the rains that come from the heavens. Very soon, therefore, father
got associated with the Heaven and the Earth became Mother Earth. Human love for
the skies therefore begins very early and continues to grip human imagination even
today (Armstrong, 2005).
1.1 Understanding the Sky
We now begin our story of the fascination of humans for this eternal beauty of the
heavens. We begin our story at a stage when the civilisation has analysed enough of
nature to understand that Sun is the source of all light on earth during day, and it
causes the day to happen as it rises in the morning. The night belongs to the stars
and especially the Moon, which is variable in its appearance. It is seen to wander
amongst the seemingly fixed backdrop of stars.
Let us assume that a small group of highly intelligent herdsmen want to
develop astronomy (without recourse to written records because they are nomads
and have, if at all, only primitive methods of recording information). However, they
selectively codify their knowledge in the form of poems for future generations. This
method of coding serves several purposes. It provides continuity, allows an average



11
person to execute the instructions and enlightenment to the learned and a degree of
confidentiality for the authors by not giving full details of the learning.
The Moon is the most prominent object for them in the night sky due to its
obvious brightness and size, apart from its palpable variability in shape and
movement in the night sky. We assume that they begin by looking at the Moon3.
1.1.1 The Moon’s Path
Human observations would have begun by taking note of the existence of the Moon.
They would notice that full Moon occurs when the Moon is opposite to the Sun in the
sky. As they observe, they notice that each night, its bright part becomes smaller and
smaller (but in a perfectly dark night sky, they would notice the gentle glow of the
dark part, also known as “earthshine”). They would also notice that every day it
moves closer to the Sun, until it falls into the Sun and a New Moon is born.
From full Moon to next full Moon is 29/30 days. This may not be a good
marker since the apparent variation in size at the point of full Moon is very subtle
it may appear nearly full for up to 3 nights but New Moon to New Moon calendar has
its own difficulty in that the first phase of the Moon is difficult to observe as any
celebration of Eid will tell you. At Full-Moon, the Moon is diametrically opposite to the
Sun and rises at sunset. In the days that follow the Moon rises later in the night after
sunset by about 51 minutes until it rises with sunrise. It also wanes during the period
until it is completely invisible when it rises at sunrise. After that the Moon rises after
sunrise and is visible until sometime after sunset. Thereafter the Moon keeps waxing
until it reaches Full-Moon. The Moon takes about 29.5 days to complete the cycle
(from Full-Moon to Full-Moon). This is referred to as synodic period of the Moon.
However, with respect to distant stars the Moon completes one rotation in 27.3 days.
This is referred to as the sidereal period of the Moon.
Early astronomers seem to have recorded this in the form of rock art, oral
compositions or written material. Some cultures theorise that the Sun gives birth to
the Moon, lets it grow till it threatens the Sun itself by its size and brightness and
3 This is a basic assumption. Many civilisations begin by looking at the Sun rather than the Moon. It is more true of Indian astronomy than the astronomy of other civilisations. It had some profound implications in their approach to heavens and their relative priorities in rituals. While Sun is the golden egg that provides life, it is Moon that decides its rhythm. We will therefore stay along this line.



12
then the Sun begins to destroy (dissolve) the Moon. In other cultures, the Moon has
been imagined to be pot that is filled during the first half and emptied during the
second half (for more discussion on astronomical myths of India see Chapter 4). The
concept of fortnight and week essentially arise from these observations even though
the names of the days come from planets.
The Moon is always seen against the backdrop of some stars. It remains near
a group of stars and passes them moving towards the east at the rate of 12 degrees
per day, visibly drifting even within a night (i.e., relative to the stars, its motion is
slower). Note that the movement of the Moon is not random, but it visits only a
handful of bright stars, distributed in a band across the sky. Early astronomers
recorded all the bright stars in the sky that the Moon visits and noted that they are
more or less fixed. They made a line joining all the stars that Moon visits and divided
these stars into 27 groups (consisting of 1 or more stars) for nearly 27 days (sidereal
revolution period). These are the lunar mansions or nakshatras4. They would then
have noted that the Sun also follows more or less the same path in the heavens.
However we will discuss this in the next section.
At this stage the astronomers would have made their first discovery that the
sidereal month brings Moon back to the neighbourhood of same star(s) in 27 but the
Moon does not have the same phase at that time. It takes Moon two additional days
to reach the same phase. They would have noticed that when the Moon returns to
the same constellation (an arbitrarily defined pattern made by stars in the sky), the
Sun has moved ahead so that the constellation that appears at sunrise or sunset
(and the middle constellation in which the Sun itself sits) is different. This forward
movement is such that after 12 lunar months, the Sun returns to nearly the same
constellation. May be people living in higher latitudes noticed this and gave up on the
Moon, since the Sun seems to be more effective in defining seasons. Since they had
to fit 12 month period for 1 year (when the Sun returns to the same constellation and
the same season returns), the path of the Sun is divided into 12 parts. Hence, 2.25
(27/12) nakshatras define the twelve different star patterns in the path of the Sun.
Sun moves through one such pattern per month called Zodiac. The month is named
4 This is true for the astronomy that gives far more emphasis on Moon compared to the Sun.



13
after the constellation at Full-Moon. That is, during the month of Kartik, the Full-Moon
at midnight may be in Krittika or Rohini etc.
However, the association between seasons to lunar months creates a problem
since the lunar 12 months end in 354 days, which is 11 day before the solar year
ends. Some cultures corrected for this by adding an additional month (intercalary
month or Adhikmasa) after 2.5 years. Many cultures chose to shift their focus to the
Sun. However, they did retain the idea of 12 months to a year. They noted down the
diametrically opposite star at sunset/sunrise, i.e., rising star at sunset or setting star
at sunrise and noted that they are fairly close to each other in the sky.
1.1.2 The Sun’s Path
Some cultures began their astronomical recordings by concentrating on the Sun.
They noted that over a period of time, the point of sunrise keeps shifting in a cyclic
manner between a northernmost point and a southernmost point. When sunrise
happens at its northernmost limit, the Sun remains above the horizon for the longest
period, giving the longest day of the year. Similarly, when the Sun rises at its
southernmost limit, the shortest day of the year is recorded. It is possible that some
megalithic structures were designed to keep track of these seasonal drifts in the
sunrise/sunset points, a possibility that we will explore in Chapter 3.
If an observer looks at a tree or puts a stick in the ground and note its shadow
he will notice several things. The shadow goes from west to east. Also, in summer,
the shadow is clearly much shorter.
The observer would then note the southernmost point and the northernmost
point of sunrise. This is not a very accurate observation since the Sun moves 1/3 of
its radius/day at these points, i.e. it appears to be stationary at these points for a few
days. The Sun moves faster near the mid-point, where the Sun will be seen for only
one day. This is also the day on which the day and night are of equal length. We call
them equinoxes. The extremes are called solstices – the winter solstice occurs in
December when the Sun is at the southernmost point and the summer solstice,
when the Sun is at the northernmost point, in June. While detailed measurements
had to wait for the arrival of clocks, astronomers of early period were quite capable



14
of measuring angular distances. The fact that the sunrise was in different
constellations during different seasons also helped in their astronomical studies.
1.1.3 Path of the Stars
Astronomers divided visible stars into groups (or patterns) and called them
constellations5). They would note that these patterns seem to disappear in the
western sky (i.e. fail to appear) at sunset each day with new ones arising in the
eastern sky. By keeping track of the star patterns visible just before sunrise or just
after sunset the astronomers could discern a stationary pattern in the sky. Over a
period of time, they would notice that this is cyclic, that eventually, the disappeared
constellations re-appear in the eastern side after 6 months. The pattern had a
periodicity of one year measured either season to season or sunrise point to sunrise
point. They would also notice that the seasons and the constellations in the sky were
related. These special constellations that fall in the path of the Sun were called
zodiacal constellations. Observers would then associate the zodiacal constellations
with seasons, e.g. Taurus at sunset means winter.
Sun moves north to south as the weather becomes colder and south to north
as the weather becomes warmer. The southward motion of the Sun is called
Dakshinayan in India and is considered bad since it marks the arrival of winter while
the journey northward, the Uttarayan is a time of celebration since the winter would
end soon. Probably, the body’s biological clock is good enough to notice changes in
day length, especially near equinoxes as the rate of change is very sharp. During
winter months, one can see more zodiacal constellations in the night sky than in
summer, since the Sun is below the horizon for a longer period of time.
As we have discussed earlier, the movements of the Sun and Moon are in the
neighbourhood of only a small fraction of stars distributed in a band across the sky
known as the zodiac. The constellations of the zodiac are divided into 12 ‘Rashis’
(Sun signs) and from the point of view of the Moon’s motions divided into 27
‘Nakshatras’ (lunar mansions).
5 Astronomers used the patterns to represent individual mythological characters and stories. The origin of the currently accepted star patterns (constellations) in the northern hemisphere was formalised in Babylonia around 3000 BC.



15
1.1.4 Path of the Seasons
The observations of seasons and astronomy would begin with noticing that the
winter nights are longer than the summer nights. At this stage, one can suggest that,
may be the winter sky spins slower. However, the relative speeds of Sun and Moon
would provide clear evidence against this idea.
Another point they would notice that the point of sunrise in the east varies with
time. They would have marked the location of sunrise point using different kinds of
marking methods. We discuss this in detail in Chapter 3 but it is important to note
that there are three important points of the summer and winter solstices and the
equinoxes (see section 1.1.2) and that the period of summer is when the Sun is to
the north of the midpoint and winter comes when the Sun is to the south of the
midpoint.
Astronomers, also associate constellations and mythologies based on
season. Long periods of observations, over several decades would show that the
orbit of the Sun precesses, that is, the Sun rises in different constellations at the
beginning of the year over millennia.
1.1.5 The Path of the Planets
There are five bright objects, apart from Sun and Moon, in the sky that seem to
wander in the sky. These wanderers are called planets. These are Mercury (Budha,
Saumya, Rauhineya, Tunga), Venus (Shukra, Usanas, Kavi, Bhrgu), Mars (Mangala,
Angaraka, Bhumija, Lohitanga, Bhauma, Kumara, Skanda), Jupiter (Guru,
Brihaspati, Angiras) and Saturn (Shani) given in the order of the speed with which
they move in the sky. If we also include the Sun and the Moon, we get 7 wanderers.
These 7 give the names to the 7 days of the week.
Mercury, Venus (as evening and morning star) and Mars are fast movers and
hence clearly show themselves to be moving. Of these, Mercury and Venus being
inner planets are not only confined to the zodiacal belt but also do not go more than
28 degrees and 45 degrees away from the Sun respectively. The outer planets, on
the other hand, show a retrograde motion, moving back and forth in the sky.
Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn require more dedicated observations since Mercury is



16
very close to the Sun and not easy to observe, while Jupiter and Saturn are slow
movers.
1.1.6 Changes in the Earth’s Orbit
The seasons arise because of the tilt of the earth’s axis of rotation to the plane of the
revolution around the Sun. This tilt is of 23 degrees6. The earth’s orbit around the
Sun is not constant and keeps changing with time. Hence the temperature profile of
the earth changes with time.
Three specific changes happen in the orbit of the Earth around the Sun
(Figure 1.1). These are: changes in the Earth’s ellipticity, changes in the inclination
of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun and the precession of the Earth due to the gravity
of the Sun7.
Figure 1.1: Long term variation in the Earth's movement a) Change in Ellipticity, b) Wobble of Orbit c)
Precession of the Earth.
6 In addition to this, the land mass distribution in the northern and southern hemisphere is different with about 79% of the land mass (above sea level) being in the northern hemisphere and only 21% in the southern hemisphere. Land has a much lower specific heat compared to water and hence it heats up much faster for the same amount of heat received from the Sun. Hence the temperature of the earth crucially depends on how much solar radiation is received by land compared to water. 7 All 3 images in this section are taken from http://geology.uprm.edu/Morelock/eustatic.htm.



17
1) Change in ellipticity of the orbit
The orbit of the Sun around the Earth is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the foci
(Figure 1.1a). However, this ellipticity (ratio between the maximum distance from the
Sun to the minimum distance) is not constant and varies with time.
2) Wobble of axis
Currently the rotational axis of the Earth makes an angle of 23.44 degrees (Figure
1.1b). This is not constant and its value can change with time.
3) Precession of Earth’s orbit
Earth moves in the gravitational potential of the Sun, the plane of its movement
precesses with respect to distant stars (Figure 1.1c). As a result of this the sunrise
point will be off by 1 degree in 72 years with respect to the zodiacs. This effect,
combined with the fact that the Earth’s orbit is elliptical with about 3% difference
between its point of closest approach, results in a complex situation. Hence the day
of the year and the constellation in which the Sun begins its northward and
southward journey also changes with time (Baity, 1973).
4) Long term variations in these parameters.
In Table 1.1 we have given the time scale of variability of these parameters.
Table 1.1: Variations in various parameters.
In Figure 1.2, the changes in these parameters are graphically represented.
As can be seen from the figure, the variation in the obliquity of the orbit has not been
significant in the last 10,000 years that concerns us here. Similarly, the ellipticity of
the Earth’s orbit has also not changed significantly over this period. The only effect of
No. Affect Time scale (years) Level of variation
1 Ellipticity About 100,000 0.00 to 0.06

consequence for us therefore is the precession of the Earth’s orbit and we ignore all
other effects in subsequent discussions.

1.1.7 Precession of Earth’s Orbit and Seasons
The precession of the Earth’s orbit and its effects are graphically shown in Figure
1.3.

19
As can be seen from the figure, the difference between the point of closest
approach (146 million km) to the farthest point (151 million km) is about 3% of the
mean. However, the seasons on Earth are the result of a complex combination of the
distance from the Sun and tilt of the Earth’s rotational axis. This primarily changes
the amount of radiation received on any part of the Earth as a function of time. In
Table 1.2, we tabulate the quantities discussed in Figure 1.3.

 Spring: From spring equinox until summer solstice

Figure 1.4: Earths precession and seasons over time (Image from http://www.answers.com/topic/milankovitch-cycles).
Based on this we can define the period of various seasons over the millennia
(Figure 1.4).
The effect of these parameters on the seasons is complex since the weather
pattern is driven by the following parameters:
1) The evaporation in the southern hemisphere while it is winter in the northern
hemisphere (around January in the present epoch in the northern
hemisphere)
2) The movement of the moisture to the equatorial latitudes at summer solstice
(around March in the present epoch in the northern hemisphere)
3) The amount of heating of the Indian sub continental plate and the Asian
landmass in early summer (around May-June in the present epoch in the
northern hemisphere)
4) The wind patterns in late summer (July to October in the present epoch in the
northern hemisphere).



21
Hence, while the intensity of the monsoons are difficult to predict, the month in
which they will appear can be estimated and are given in Table 1.3 along with the
duration of seasons (Table 1.4). Table 1.4 shows that the period in which various
seasons occur varied significantly with time.

1.2 Summary of Basic Astronomical Concepts
Astronomical knowledge requires understanding of some basic concepts and we
shall briefly summarise them here. Even for the most casual observer, there are two
prominent objects in the sky. These are the Sun and the Moon. While the Sun seems
to have a constant and overwhelming presence in the sky, the Moon waxes and
wanes. Coupled with the variations in day and night time temperatures, it takes little
to realise the importance of the Sun as life giver and Moon as a time keeper, making
each day and night different from the preceding and succeeding one. The
importance of the Sun therefore would be obvious even to the earliest humans. More
careful study, especially against a structured backdrop of geological features against
the horizon, makes it clear that the Sun does not always rise exactly in the cardinal
East and does not always set exactly in the cardinal West. In general, the Sun rises
somewhere in the East and sets somewhere in the West. The exact point of sunrise
in fact drifts from a point North East to South East in a periodic cycle of about 365
days. The Sun rises exactly in the East and sets exactly in the West only twice a



22
year and these days are marked by 12 hours of sunlight and 12 hours of darkness
(all over the earth). These days are days of equinoxes. The day of northernmost
point of sunrise, is the longest day in the northern hemisphere and is called summer
solstice. Similarly, the day of southernmost point of sunrise is the shortest day of
winter in the northern hemisphere, and is called winter solstice. The seasons (and
names) are out of phase in the southern hemisphere by six months.
The next object of interest is the Moon. Twelve full-Moon cycles bring the
sunrise point nearly to the same place, short by a little more than 11 days. Moon
therefore makes an important calendar. However, the relation between the phase of
the Moon and its rise time is a complex one. The Moon rises at sunset on full Moon.
It rises at midday when the Moon is halfway towards full-Moon. It rises at midnight
when the Moon is halfway to new-Moon.
Beyond this is the relation of these celestial objects to the stars. The Sun and
the Moon seem to have a fixed relation to the stars in the sky, moving in a rather
narrow band of stars. The stars can be grouped into small constellations so that they
can be easily memorised. Civilisations of cold regions, sensitive to the warmth given
by the Sun are more likely to notice the exact points of sunrise or sunset and the
constellation that occurs just before sunrise. These constellations would certainly
have an important position amongst other constellations and are separately called
zodiacal constellations. Similarly, for people sensitive to calendars and using nights
for navigation, the stars visited by Moon would also be considered important and
these are called Lunar Mansions. In the Indian context, the constellations (tārā
samuha) of Sun are called rashi while the lunar mansions are called nakshatras. The
term for constellations (tārā samuha) is a very general and generic term meaning
‘group of stars’. It appears very late in the literature and most of the ancient Indian
astronomy is restricted to rāshi and nakshatra.
About six thousand objects are visible in the night sky. Apart from Sun and
Moon, five more of these objects are not stationary with respect to other objects but
move around in the sky. Together, they make the seven wanderers of the sky called
planets. These wanderers also have a narrow band in which they move, somewhat
overlapping with the Sun’s path. Also, each of these wanderers has its own preferred



23
period. For two of them (Mercury and Venus) the farthest separation from the Sun in
the sky is limited.
Similarly, other observations are those of eclipses and their apparent random,
if fearful occurrences. There would also be observations of other transients like
comets and meteorites which are relatively rare and aperiodic events. Such
observations may also include supernovae (see e.g. Joglekar et al., 2007).
The last in the list of such naked eye observations would be the drift in the
zodiacal signs in which sunrise occurs at equinoxes. This result of precession of the
equinoxes also changes the time of the year when a specific season occurs. With its
annual drift of 0.72 minutes of arc per year, the motion is very subtle and requires
meticulous observations over a very large time period before it can be noticed. It is
surmised that some mythical stories like that of Tauroctony – the killing of a bull by
the god Mithras, represents the shifting of the point of the spring equinox Sun away
from the constellation of Taurus, the bull.
In the process of acquiring such knowledge, a society would have invested a
lot of its intellectual, technological and financial resources and must have taken a lot
of time. Hence when archaeologists and historians are able to prove the existence of
such knowledge at some point in the history of an ancient culture, it is understood
that there must have been previously a tradition of conducting meticulous
observations of the sky and a means of transmitting them over generations to
acquire this knowledge.

2. Astronomy in the Context of Human Intellectual Growth
We discussed a logical sequence of growth of astronomy in the last chapter. In
reality this growth is closely related to the growth of a culture or a civilisation and its
needs. We will now take a more formal look at the growth of astronomy in the Indian
subcontinent8.
Developing an understanding of the universe requires an enormous
expenditure of time and resources, both human and technological. It also dictates
and is dictated by growth in fields such as mathematics and geometry. In astronomy,
mathematics, technology and mythology all merge. A study of astronomy provides
an excellent window to the intellectual growth of a civilisation. For a general
discussion on archaeoastronomy and enthnoastronomy we refer the reader to some
excellent articles by Baity (1973) and for a broad summary of growth of astronomy in
India, see Kaye (1998).
Attempts made by humans in trying to understand the heavens are of
profound interest and importance. Astronomy9 is one field which, at one level is
highly utilitarian for its ability to predict seasonal changes in weather, and at another
level is completely abstract, more related to the human place in the vastness of the
universe. At one level, rains, thunder, lightning and other extraordinary events
provide the source of life. At another level, the steady and unaffected movement of
stars and serenity of the heavens on clear nights must have always fascinated
humans. Completely arbitrary but spectacular events such as the appearance of
comets and meteor showers must have had a profound impact on the human
psyche. Together therefore, the study of astronomy must have attracted the attention
of some of the best minds of that time. It must have given rise to the growth of
mathematics as humans tried to keep track of these complex, if subtle, movements
of heavenly objects.
8 Historically the region that is currently split between Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka was essentially one unit that is generally referred to as the Indian Subcontinent. We will use label ‘India’ and the ‘Subcontinent’ interchangeably except where it refers to a specific location. 9 Initially we use the word ‘astronomy’ to indicate all events above the earth. It is only with development of ideas and observations will the distinction between earth-related events like rains and more heavenly phenomena must have arisen. The word astronomy, as used today, is of course, restricted to the latter objects.



25
At the core of all human development is the intellectual growth of the
civilisation. Once one understands how its intellectual growth occurred, other
developments can then be analysed as an offshoot of the original growth in ideas
and thoughts. This development sets the pace of the growth of a civilisation over
millennia after the original ideas arrive on the scene. Here we discuss the five
parallel developments in human intellectual growth and how astronomy provides a
rich canvas for all these fields. We will then discuss how these concepts merged to
find expression in art especially religious architecture.
The human journey towards civilisation began with the hunter-gatherer stage.
Their activities were aided by taming select animals having capabilities which the
human body could never hope to surpass. Humans could achieve this because of
their superior intellect which gave them unsurpassed adaptability and versatility. The
human brain, far superior in comprehending and manipulating the environment,
ensured that humans would survive and flourish in all types of difficult environments.
Additional intellect gave humans a vision which far exceeded their needs for
survival and it was not long before humans had a large number of artificially made
comforts. These included controlled fire, garments made of animal skins, ability to
find safe environment and group activities etc. These additional capabilities provided
them with enough leisure to look beyond their existence. These developments in
mental activity can be seen primarily in five different ways (Figure 2.1). The night sky
provided them with an ideal canvas on which they could expound on their curiosities.
These are:
1) Myths
2) Splendour of the night sky
3) Early monumental architecture
4) Religious ideas
5) Expression through art
As we shall see below all these developments came together in the form of
temples that paid homage to the superhuman who oversaw the working of the world.
We discuss the developments in each of these fields below.



26
Figure 2.1: Interrelation between various expressions of human intellect and astronomy.
2.1 Myths
Myths are used by humans in a variety of ways. These include creation of legends
concerning some supernatural beings, heroes or events. They have also been used
for personification of natural forces. Myths are not static and are in fact not just a
construct of the past. We live amongst a lot of modern legends that are also mythical
and imaginative, glorifying or condemning some people or events beyond what
available evidence would suggest. Myths are therefore very dynamic. In turn, they
provide a boost to a lot of other faculties such as development of imagination, growth
in linguistics with addition of new ideas, phrases and words, and also provide group
identity through local myths (see e.g. Armstrong, 2005 for a more general discussion
on the history of myths).
At a deeper level, however, myths do more than this. Myths are very complex
entities designed to give a meaning to irrational experiences such as death by
speculating on rebirth or higher existence. For example, in reaction to the natural



27
decay of the dead, they also give a sense of purpose why the dead should be
tended. They also try to reduce the sense of loss of the dead by defining a higher
plane to which the dead move on. In Hinduism as defined in the Vedic period, for
example, the whole universe is a triangular relation between humans, ancestors and
gods (Jamison and Witzel, 1992). Each of who must appease the other to get their
comforts and this delicate balance is maintained through a complex collection of
rituals that are fascinating.
At another level, they give a sense of purpose to life by defining heroes and
the ideal behaviour which all virtuous people must aspire to follow. They define what
the ideal quality of life is, and how one should try to achieve it. By discussing the
inter-god relations, they permit us to see our own weaknesses and strength and
provide a third party imagery that allow discussions of human frailties, virtues and
vices without bringing in the humans implicitly addressed. By defining their character
in detail, they also give promise of manipulating gods who control the cosmos. Even
more fascinating is the idea that the world was created by an un-create, un
describable Brahman and all creations, including the gods and the universe arise
from the un-describable one (see Nasadiya Sukta in Chapter 4). This Brahman
remains undefined and un-worshipped. All other gods, even the Great Trinity who
manifest the powers of the Brahman in our universe are His progenies.
They also permit us to create an ideal world in our imagination where the
virtuous are not tested for being virtuous and where supreme (if unseen) justice
prevails. This ideal world, far removed from the real-politic of daily grind, provides a
hope for the deprived of someday, someplace, receiving their honest dues.
However, one of the most fascinating aspects of human jump of imagination is
the speculation about the universe beyond immediate existence and their own
relation to the cosmos. The ideas of universe being a creation and speculation on
the powers and good of the great one arise in mythology.
Myths also change, grow and evolve with time and are put to different uses by
different purposes. Some myths also tend to be created for specific purposes either
to smoothen out the wrinkles or inconsistencies created by earlier myths or to conflict
other myths. They often integrate new ideas into old stories to provide consistency



28
and continuity that humans are so fond of. We discuss a more detailed list of some
of the astronomical myths of India separately in Chapter 4.
2.1.1 Some Examples of Astronomy in Myths
The most profound and spectacular thought of this kind is undoubtedly the Nasadiya
Sukta of Rig Veda (X, 129) discussed in section 4.4. It expresses such a large
number of ideas that form the basis of several later discourses. Advaita argues that
the soul is the same as Brahman; dvaita sees the Supreme and us as different. Their
existence is implicitly implied and sanctioned within this world. It also gives the idea
of Swayambhu nature of universe. And yet, the birth of the universe is a result of
love (kaama) that is such a human emotion. The universe arises because of the
kaama of the great one, something that would be an inherent property of all others.
Within it, it also carries the idea of hierarchical nature of the universe with the great
one unspecified and undefined but other gods all the same do have legitimacy. But
they are lesser gods for they arose after the great one had created the universe.
Since the world is essentially the product of this kaama, it is essentially an illusory
creation or māyā created by the great one and sustained by a variety of ways. In a
sense, it does not even preclude other universes being born and wonders if, at a
fundamental level, it is unknowable. This sukta is by far an epitome of human
thought, rarely surpassed in all the millennia that have followed.
Yet, within it, it carries one of the most important implications. If the universe
was created through the desire of the Great One, then there must be an object of his
desire. However, the whole universe is a result of his kaama. So the object of his
desire must also be a product of his own creation. We therefore come across the
great conflict of incest between father and daughter, something that all civilisations
perforce forbid due to their profoundly destabilising effect on social structure. Hence
a series of speculations about how gods do not approve of this relation and a variety
of related mythologies of Rudra (the one who makes you cry, the one who is anger
personified, the one who is a destroyer) are called upon to straighten things out. Yet,
Nasadiya Sukta remains one of the great creations of human mind.
Similarly, there are speculations on the concept of time. Atharva Veda (AV
XIX, 53) speculates on the origin of time in Purnah kumbhah Sukta (see section 4.4).



29
Again another marvel of philosophical speculations, it begins with a rather mundane
definition of time “Time drives like a horse with seven reins, A thousand eyed, un
aging stallion” though the use of the unit seven is intriguing since the Vedic time
units are a 29 day month and a fortnight long paksha. The idea of a seven-day
period arises much later. The universality of time, something science readily accepts,
is elegantly stated by stating that “Simultaneously, we see Time here, there,
everywhere”. Essentially time is the root of everything. The sukta also goes on to say
that “In time is consciousness and life”, “Time is the lord of all there is, The Father,
he, of the Creator” and very elegantly brings out the contradiction in our
understanding of time by concluding that “Time created the creatures, Time created
in the beginning the Lord of creatures. From Time comes Self-Existent. Energy
likewise from Time derives”. Yet, an important statement is “He who was father has
become their son. There is no glory higher than this”. This ultimate dichotomy in our
grasp of the concept of time cannot be better stated.
2.1.2 Evolution of Myths
Myths also evolve with time with subtle changes in their character, description and
detailing. While many examples of this can be cited, the most intriguing is the
change in the myths about Rahu and Ketu. From the original story of an asura
whose severed head – Rahu pursues the Sun and Moon but is unable to gulp it thus
explaining eclipses, the story then extends to include Ketu the body of the demon.
With its long extended body it is also synonymous to the comet (Dhumketu).
However, in the period of Siddhantic astronomy, Rahu and Ketu were used as the
ascending and descending nodes of the point of intersection of the paths of the Sun
and the Moon, to predict the eclipses. Similarly, the changing form of Rudra also
makes for fascinating reading.
2.2 Splendour of the Night Sky
Though it is the aesthetic appeal of the night sky and the heavenly bodies that no
doubt gave rise to the science of astronomy, it is also exacting and predictable.
While the exact cause of this periodicity would not become clear for a long time, a lot
of ad hoc formulations were suggested and evaluated from prehistoric times. This
includes the speculation of the Sun riding through the sky on a chariot of horses and
so on. However, the most important aspect of astronomy was probably the



30
association of the sky with life-sustaining forces such as rains and seasons. Since
these arise from the sky, the idea that Father Sky seeds Mother Earth has been
around from the earliest periods. The blessings from the heavens in the form of rains
do not come randomly. They come only when the Earth is in the same point in its
path around the Sun. This corresponds with specific conjunctions of the location of
sunrise and appearance of specific stars and asterisms in the night sky. With
growing experience, it would be possible to identify when planting seeds in
anticipation of the rain would be profitable. This would necessitate a whole host of
observational techniques, record keeping and predictions. Several time units arise
from astronomy. These are:
 Hours from the diurnal (daily) motions of both Sun and Moon
 Days from the motion of the Sun
 Week from Moon’s motion
 Fortnight from Moon (waxing and waning, leading to a “dark fortnight” and
“bright fortnight”)
 Month from Sun and Moon (one lunar cycle of phases)
 Year from Sun completing one cycle of visits to all zodiacal constellations
 Five year from synchronisation of solar and lunar years
 Sixty year cycle: Since Jupiter and Saturn come together every 60 years, the
conjunction provides clock of this time scale.
 Hundreds of years: The precession of the earth’s rotational axis is a slow
process and will permit estimation of hundreds to thousands of years since
the observation of the constellation in which the solstices or equinoxes occur.
Humans soon realised the importance of observing the heavens over long
periods of time and must have been impressed by its regularity. This must have
given an impetus to the human efforts to understand the logic of the working of
nature.
Farming and other sciences while remaining empirical give interesting insights
into human existence. The relation between the cycle of botanical life forms to
zoological life forms is also crucial to human evolution. A lot of insights must have
been gained from predictions based on astronomy. In turn, the successes of these



31
fields encouraged improved storage and transportation techniques and gave impetus
to various technologies.
This interrelation between celestial cycles and daily life on Earth would have
necessitated the standardisation of measurement techniques. In particular, from
early times, there are myths about constellations that project the human perception
of the patterns in the sky. Myths about planets generally refer to their colour, speed
of movement, intrinsic brightness etc. Myths about stars refer to specific stories
about individual rishis, their wives, their children and the gods.
Astronomy is utilitarian at its most fundamental level and has been enriched
by several parallel growths such as needs for calendars for ritual purposes, for
navigational purposes, for astrological purpose and also as a study of great beauty
and rhythm.
2.3 Early Monumental Architecture
From very early times, man has exhibited an urge to modify landscape on large
scales to create monuments. In the Indian subcontinent, probably the earliest
monuments are the enigmatic ash mounds, created in the south Indian Neolithic by
firing accumulations of dung over many years. Though some researchers have
attributed the origins of this practice for sanitary reasons, there are others who
speculate that these were monumental spaces created for ritualistic purposes. Ash
mound creation declined around 1500 BC and the creation of megalithic structures,
which might have originated in the Neolithic too, gained popularity across peninsular
India, in the South Indian Iron Age, as well as some pockets to the north and
northeast.
Megaliths are structures, usually built of large stones, organised in different
forms. A large fraction of megalith types are sepulchral. They seem to have
originated with the need to protect the dead from the vagaries of the environment
and particularly mutilation from animals. These early markers of burial (or cremation)
grew with time. Their shape and complexity both grew with time as did the stories
associated with them. We find a large variety of different stone structures from early
periods (Chapter 3).



32
It has long been surmised that some megalithic monuments have definite
intentional alignments to points of astronomical importance on the horizon.. In fact,
there have been serious claims that at least some megalithic monuments may have
been actually astronomical observatories. The most famous example of this is
Stonehenge in England (Hoyle 1977). Some megaliths could have been designed to
mark out the sunrise and sunset locations over the period of one year. Their main
purpose might have been to understand the relation between the sunrise location
and the seasons. However, they would immediately acquire multiple roles. They
would be, as calendrical devices, predictors of seasons as well as a fascinating
structure that marks a place for social gatherings. Therefore, it would be a place of
prestige or a status symbol to the habitation, especially because it would symbolise
the wealth and prosperity of the settlement that could generate sufficient surplus in
food production to spare the enormous amount of man-hours dedicated to erecting
such structures.
Recent studies of megaliths in Byse and Nilaskal in Karnataka suggest that at
least some of the megalithic structures in India have intentional astronomical
alignments in their layout (Menon et al. 2012). The site at Byse (Figure 3.9) has
several large stones that seem to be randomly arranged. However, a closer study of
the stones shows that they have been carefully organised so that the shadows of
one stone fall on other stones at the summer and winter solstices (Figure 3.11).
While the observatory of the kind seen at Byse does not have a preferred vantage
point from which observations need to be made, structures such as the Stonehenge
have a specific point, usually in the geometrical centre from which the observations
need to be made. If the astronomical hypothesis is true, this point therefore would
have its own strategic importance and as such mark a place of reverence since a
person of learning, sitting at that position would be a source of immense amount of
predictive knowledge. In the case of Junapani near Nagpur, where a large area is
covered with hundreds of boulder circle megaliths, it has been suggested that some
stones in these stone circles associated with burials are also marked with cupmarks
that may have astronomical significance (Vahia et al. 2011).



33
2.4 Religious Ideas
Religion can be defined as a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and
purpose of the universe, especially when considered as the creation of a
superhuman agency or agencies. It usually involves devotional and ritual
observances, and often contains a moral code governing the conduct of human
affairs.
Thus it is only natural that religious practices should encompass all aspects of
human relation to the environment. These ideas begin with early beliefs in natural
forces, Mother Earth and Father Sky. They become more complex with time,
involving natural forces, their abstractions and inclusion of moral values and other
beliefs. In most places, these early religions have been replaced by later ones where
specific manifestations of gods are identified and their works are considered the
word of god and worshipped in all its complexities. However, in Hinduism, we have
continuity from early beliefs to more modern manifestations, where all aspects of the
evolution of religious thoughts can be seen and their interrelation can be explored.
2.5 Expression through Art
Expression through art by humans in the form of rock art, stone etchings and
figurines date back to quite early periods. These works of art have represented day
to-day human activities of the period, festivals, abstract designs etc. in a visually
appealing manner. With the increasing sophistication of human thought process
these took the form of either small isolated works of art or large scale murals. In
many cases these skills have been further enhanced to create images in relief and
later on idols for a formal representation of heroes, heavens and gods.
The records of myths from times before the historical period can be gauged
from the images in rock art. Figure 2.2 from Onake Kindi hill in Karnataka is an
example of an enigmatic drawing that seems to suggest a certain struggle to
represent life, death and the cosmos.



34
Figure 2.2: Rock painting from Onake Kindi hill, Chikka Rampur, Raichur District, Karnataka (Image by Erwin Neumayer reproduced from Moorti, 1994). The picture shows a complex representation of a human burial with Sun and Moon and other complex imageries.
The rock art given in Figure 2.2 is a complex imagery that includes a human
body with a burial in the centre surrounded by grave goods and with a wavy pattern
coming out on one side. This is followed by an outer rim of seven circles in left
semicircle and six circles in the right semicircle. In the semicircle containing the
human body, the surrounding small circles are further entwined by a pattern and the
two of these circles are dotted. The outermost rim is embellished by a pattern of rays
and petals and the transition between them does not occur at the points of division of
the inner circles. The image has a palpable mix of burial and astronomical imagery
with the rays and petals identified by rock art specialists as the Sun and the Moon.
While a true interpretation of the artist’s intent may elude us, it is certain that he or
she was trying to express the relationship between life, death and the cosmos as per
the belief system of that time. The fact that this painting is located on a horizontal
rock face overhanging a vertical face decorated with paintings of human beings and
animals engaged in mundane daily chores suggest that the artist regarded it as a
representation of a plane removed from daily life.



35
3. Indian Megaliths and Astronomy
Space is experienced and perceived by different life forms in different ways. All
animals probably create some kind of map of their surroundings and use the local
map to search for food and water, identify threats or simply find a place to rest.
Several animals are territorial and go through elaborate exercises to mark out and
protect their territory. A sense of long-term safety drives animals underground, above
ground and to places that provide a vantage point for early warning and even to the
skies. All animals scan the space within their reach all the time and therefore, for
most animals, eyes are the most important tool to sense the world, though other
senses no doubt augment and enhance the perception of space. We all like to
visualise our world.
However, there is an additional dimension to our existence and that is another
enigmatic entity called time. Unlike space, the movement of time is unidirectional and
irreversible and humans realised this from a very early period. There is probably no
better demonstration of this than death when a person irrevocably passes away.
There is no argument, no appeal and no possibility of change of status. To be dead,
is to be take leave forever. Then there are other intermediate time scale of day and
night, the seasons, years and human ageing. Until a sense of history and tradition
arises, a lifespan is the longest time scale conceivable by humans. It is only when
group existence and continuing traditions take root that humans become sensitive to
longer time scale which goes into multiple generations. Yet, except for few truly
exceptional humans, most are forgotten with 2 or 3 generations. At the same time,
as human emotional roots become stronger, the desire of immediate generations to
give respect to the dead, to communicate with them beyond their graves and to keep
their memory alive is very strong.
This strange set of concepts of space and time come curiously together where
commemorative monuments such as megaliths are concerned. Probably driven by
early horrors of seeing the bodies of their dead mutilated by other animals, humans



36
had taken to securely interring their bodies from the earliest times10. The practice of
burial goes back to even the Palaeolithic times, though marking of burials makes an
advent with megaliths.
Sepulchral megaliths are designed not only to bury the dead, but also to help
us remember where they were buried long after they are gone. It is an innovative use
of space, designed to defeat the cruelty of time, which wishes to move on from every
occurrence of an important event. In revenge, time also actively erases common
memory. Human memories of individuals are short-lived and later generations lose
memory of their ancestors within a few generations. Hence, it is possibly to
remember the most important aspects of the past, humans created markers in space
to aid their memory. And yet, in spite of all the efforts, in most cases these original
memories get lost in the mist of time and have to be recreated as best as we can.
Yet there are other classes of megaliths that are not sepulchral and the exact
purpose for which they were erected seem to elude us. Many of these are stone
alignments or avenues which are arrangements of large number of menhirs in
patterns – sometimes grids or staggered grids, but often with no discernible pattern
too. Several of these stone alignments have been demonstrated to have intentional
alignments to points of astronomical significance on the local horizon, such as
sunrise and sunset points on the solstices and equinoxes. It is quite possible that
these could have been used as calendrical devices to keep track of time by
observing the movement of the points of sunrise and sunset of various days.
Skeptics argue that there was no need for such monumental constructions to do that
which could be achieved with more modest markers such as wooden poles with
lesser expenditure of time and effort. Since the alignments are shown to be
intentional at many sites, it is quite possible that such astronomically aligned
megaliths could have been used for ritualistic purposes with the alignments to the
Sun (and possibly the Moon) on specific dates imbued with meaning that is lost to us
today. Whatever the case may be, it is definite that the builders of these enigmatic

monuments attributed sufficient importance to them so as to set aside the
inordinately large amounts of time and labour needed to erect them.
3.1 Megaliths in India
In India, construction of megaliths probably began in the Neolithic, though the
practice became far more widespread and popular in the Iron Age. The practice of
erecting megaliths is still prevalent in some parts of the country, such as the north
east, though it is not known if the practice is culturally contiguous with the Iron Age
practices. Most of the megaliths in India are found in the southern part or peninsular
India, though there are other pockets of megalithic sites found at Vidarbha, Kumaon,
Rajasthan, Jharkand etc. The time-span during which this practice held sway is also
very large, with the origins arguably stretching back to 2500BC and lasting till
200AD. One of the biggest problems in our understanding of Indian megaliths is the
paucity of reliable dates, which bases this tentative chronology on a handful of dates
from widely separated sites. As mentioned earlier, a large fraction of megaliths are
sepulchral or commemorative in nature. The most famous example is that of
Brahmagiri, which was excavated by Wheeler (1947) and helped establish the
culture-sequence in south Indian prehistory (Morrison, 2005). However, there are
also megaliths that are non-sepulchral, as can be seen from the classification given
below.
In the Indian subcontinent, megaliths of various forms are found (Figures 3.1,
3.2). They can be divided into two classes (Moorti 1994, 2008):
1. Sepulchral which contain the physical remains of dead persons below and are
usually cist or pit burials with surface markers assuming the form of boulder
circles. Slab circles, cairns etc. or combinations of these.
2. Non-sepulchral, which might be commemorative – such as dolmens, or of
unknown purpose like stone alignments and avenues.



38
It is important to note that this classification is not watertight and that some
forms which are sepulchral in one geographic region can be non-sepulchral in
another.
Figure 3.1: Variety of Megaliths found in the Indian subcontinent.
Figure 3.2: Stone circles of central India.



39
3.1.1 Sepulchral Megaliths
The sepulchral megaliths contain remains of the dead in a variety of forms. They
could be primary burials, in which case the dead is interred soon after death. They
contain a complete skeleton (in either flat or curled up positions) with grave goods
such as grains or tools as homage to the dead or for the dead to use in afterlife.
In secondary burials the remains of the dead, essentially their bones, are put
in urns, pits or stone chambers called cists. The location of the dead is most often
marked with stone circles but cairns (a heap of stones covering funerary remains)
and circles made with slabs of stones may also be employed as markers on the
surface. The structures tend to have large stones made into a construct which is an
abstract replication of a living habitat. However, a major difference is that unlike the
house of the living, the house of the dead tends to be sturdier. In the imagination of
the people, the dead seem to live longer than the living and need better resting
place. It is not unusual for burials to have markers to oriented to a specific direction.
The bodies tend to be aligned either north – south (with the head in the north) or east
west (with the head in the east) but random directions are also known.
The hero stones of much later periods in history are often not sepulchral but
are memorials for a fallen hero. These typically have engravings on them either of a
warrior or god and are generally installed to commemorate a person who died in a
noble cause – defending cattle in a raid or the modesty of womenfolk or in battle.
Hero stones could be the next step of evolution of menhirs –single unmarked
standing stones, sometimes marking the spot of burials in prehistoric times.
3.1.2 Non-sepulchral Megaliths
The most common amongst the non-sepulchral megaliths are the menhirs, stone
alignments and avenues (Moorti 1994, 2008), though some arcaheologists classify
dolmens too under this head. Some stone alignments are spread over a very large
area of several hundred square meters. The larger alignments, such as the one at
Hanamsagar, also seem to have been planned with care and set up with the labour
of an entire community. It seems that these have a certain time evolution and long
traditions that are now lost. In most cases, their use is obscure and local



40
speculations vary from healing stones for cattle to tethering posts for horses and
elephants and even that the stones represent a petrified army! Obviously, they are
far too complex to admit of such simple explanations. Some of the alignments are of
undressed boulders arranged in patterns loosely arranged to the cardinal directions
but some consist of large slabs deftly quarried out and dressed and arranged more
accurately. There are preferred orientations depending on the region of occurrence
that may point to cultural differences.
3.1.3 Knowledge Systems of the Megaliths Builders
The state of technology possessed by the builders of the megaliths has been
understood by conventional archaeology. Craftsmanship such as smithery,
carpentry, bead-making etc. are known to have been prevalent during these times.
Metallurgical studies of the iron found in graves and production areas have attested
to the excellent knowledge of metallurgy in the period (Mudhol 1997). The socio
economic systems extant in those times have also been studied well (Moorti 2008,
1994). However, not much is known about the knowledge systems of these ancient
engineers and builders. They must have possessed refined engineering skills, and
hence some knowledge of mechanics, visualization and, by implication – of
geometry, physics and mathematics. The elegant design of dolmens such as the
ones found at Hire Benkal made of very heavy and large blocks of stone (Figure 3.3)
or a laterite rock-cut chamber burial in Kerala, crafted to perfection (Figure 3.4) bear
testimony to this.
Figure 3.3: Dolmens at Hire Benkal.

Some of the interesting megalithic sites in the southern Indian states of Karnataka
and Kerala are listed in Table 3.1.

42
Many of these sites were found to be heavily disturbed (Chik Benkal, parts of
Brahmagiri) or completely destroyed (Kyaddigeri).
3.3 Insights into Select Megalithic Sites
Menon (2012) has measured the orientations at some of the sites listed in Table 3.1.
Menon (2012) suggests that the older types (by stylistic dating) of
sepulchral/commeorative megaliths are without any preferred orientation (such as at
Meguti Hill, Aihole) pattern and some (such as the dolmens of Rajan Koluru)
exclisively south-facing. The later types (such as the dolmens of Hire Benakal) are
mostly east- or west-facing, though other orientations too are found less frequently.
A large majority of the east and west facing monuments face points on the horizon
that are well within the annual range of sunrise and sunset. This suggests that it was
intended that they face sunrise or sunset on some days of the year. In this context it
might be relevant to mention that according to the currently prevailing traditions
among the Gond tribe of central India, their dead are buried either aligned east-west
with the head to the east or north-south with the head to the south with a cairn
marking the burial. We shall discuss some specific megalithic types below.
3.3.1 Avenue Monuments
Among the non-sepulchral typologies, the avenue seems like a potential candidate
for astronomical use. Two kinds of avenues have been reported by Menon (2012).
The first consisted of the established avenue sites of northern Karnataka, such as
Hanamsagar, Vibhutihalli etc. These are grids (according to Allchin (1956),
Paddayya (1995), Rao (2005)) consisting of a large number of rough, undressed
stones of varying dimensions. At Vibhutihalli, the rows of stones are loosely aligned
to the cardinal directions. The stones seem to have been rolled down the slopes of
the low, boulder-strewn outcrop to the west of the avenue and manoeuvred into
position. An aerial view of a similar site at Hanamsagar taken from the hill on the
west, however, seems to suggest a curvature in the alignment of the rocks (Figure
3.5).



43
Figure 3.5: A view of the alignment at Hanamsagar.
3.3.2 The Nilaskal Group of Menhir Sites
Near the town of Hosanagara in southern Karnataka there is a group of menhirs
sites described by Sundara (Sundara 2004, 1975). Nilaskal was reported by
Narasimhaiah (1959) and subsequently studied by Sundara. Sundara also reports
three other sites – Byse, Hergal and Mumbaru (Sundara 2004). Locations of these
sites are shown in Figure 3.6.



44
Figure 3.6: Location of the four menhir sites.
These sites consist of a large number of menhirs made of either quarried
stone slabs (as at Nilaskal, Figures 3.7, 3.8) or natural elongated stones of lenticular
cross-section (as at Hergal and Mumbaru) or a combination of both (as at Byse,
Figure 3.9). The menhirs at Nilaskal were recorded as menhirs, “erected
haphazardly, unlike those of Vibhutihalli or north Karnataka” (Sundara 2004, 1975).
Menon (2012) has reported more than 100 menhirs at Nilaskal. All these menhirs are
erected with their long axis of cross-section oriented north-south (Figure 3.10). Many
pairs of stones form sight-lines to the sunrise and sunset points on the local horizon
during both the solstices, at Nilaskal (Figure 3.8) as well as Byse (Figures 3.11). In
fact, at Byse, all the menhirs pair up with other menhirs to frame the rising and
setting Sun at the solstices, effectively forming a “solstitial grid” (Figure 3.11). These
sight-lines appear to be intentional, though we do not have sufficient evidence yet to
determine whether the menhirs were arranged to form a “calendar device” to keep
track of time by observing the solar cycle (Menon, Vahia and Rao, 2012).



45

Figure 3.10: Orientation of select menhirs at Nilaskal with north at the top.



47
Figure 3.11: The “solstitial grid” at Byse.
The matter is made complicated by the observation of what appears to be
sepulchral typologies (a disturbed cairn, as well as several cairn-like mounds) in the
vicinity of the menhirs at Byse. Menhirs in Karnataka were believed to be largely
non-sepulchral, as the excavation of menhirs at Maski etc. indicates. However,
Sundara’s observations of cists near Byse and our observations suggest that all
menhirs need not be non-sepulchral. Interestingly Sundara’s study of several
exposed cists near Byse yielded pottery and human bones but no iron objects
(Sundara 2004). This, coupled with his observation of Neolithic pottery shards at
Nilaskal during a chance excavation for a road (Sundara 1975), may even point an
earlier chronological time-frame for these menhirs sites.
Recently, we have chanced upon a hitherto unreported site (at Aaraga Gate)
of similar typology in the same region, bringing the now known sites of this particular
type to five. This leads us to propose this type of menhir monuments as a new sub
class of avenue monuments – consisting of either natural boulders of elongated
cross-section or thin quarried slabs, oriented with their long-axes of cross section N
S and arranged so that pairs of them point to the sunrise/sunset points during
solstices on the local horizon.



48
Also at several places in the locality, we have come across single stones near
roads – that conform to the same typology – elongated cross-section, with long axes
oriented N-S, that leads us to wonder if they were parts of such menhirs/avenue
sites that were disturbed by road-building activities. If so, then this type seems to
have been quite prevalent in southern Karnataka.
In summary therefore, the study of megalithic monuments to understand the
astronomical knowledge of their builders, as evident from their form and orientation,
is a challenging task – both because of the nature of the task itself, and because of
the fact that most of these are unprotected – thus heavily disturbed by development
activities. Hence there is an urgent need to study and document as many sites as
possible immediately. Our studies of the orientational preferences of megalithic
monuments seem to suggest intentional orientation of several megalith typologies
towards points of celestial significance on the local horizon. Especially interesting is
the existence of a new sub-type of avenue monuments that consist of menhirs of
elongated cross-section oriented with their individual long-axes N-S and arranged
such that several pairs frame the solstice sunrises and sunsets. While the intentional
orientation of several pairs of menhirs to the solstice sunrises and sunsets does not
by itself constitute a calendar device, a detailed survey and analysis of these sites
could pave the way for a better understanding of megalithic astronomy in the Indian
subcontinent.
3.3.3 Junapani
Junapani is a town about 10 km north-west of Nagpur, a city in central India. The
region is referred to as Vidarbha region. Suvrathan (2010) has discussed the
landscape and megaliths of this region in a detailed comparative study of history and
archaeology of the region. The region was well populated with several centres of
habitation from around 1000 BC to present and is believed to be an important region
in the north-south corridor of India. It has several megalithic sites dated to between
1000 BC and 300 AD. The dates are based on the artefacts found in the graves
associated with the megaliths which tend to have iron implements. One interesting
feature of the region is that the megaliths tend to be stone circle groups close to
riverbeds (Figure 3.12). They are in a region known for its rich metallic soil. They are



49
believed to be associated with local groups and clans. They also tend to have stones
with cup marks on them (Abbas 2014, Abbas and Vahia, 2014).
Figure 3.12: Google Earth image of Junapani showing stone circles.
Stylistically, they are uniform in typology, unlike the megaliths in southern
India which tend to be varied in form - menhirs, dolmens and other non-sepulchral
structures as well as sepulchral megaliths including the stone circle typology.
Eighty-nine megalithic sites have been catalogued in Suvrathan (2010) in
Vidarbha region out of which 51 are around Nagpur region. They are also visible in
Google Earth images (Figure 3.12). Out of these, 54 sites have only stone circles, 4
sites have a dolmen while one has a dolmen and a stone circle. Forty sites are
purely habitation sites. Amongst these the largest site is Khairwada with about 1400
stone circles, cairns and habitation deposits spanning from megalithic to early
historical period (Jamkhedkar, 1981). Junapani is the second largest site with 150
stone circles of similar period. The site was excavated by Thapar (1961). Three of
the stone circles were excavated and two of these had human remains along with
other funerary objects. In one case, the remains of an animal from the Equidae
(horse) family were found. All the circles seem to belong to the same period.
However, the most unusual features were the presence of cup-marked stones in the
stone circles.



50
In order to understand the stone circles and to study whether they have any
connection with astronomy or cosmogony of the people of this region, Abbas et al.
(2010) studied the site. The drawing of the typical stone circle is given in Figure 3.13
and a complex cup mark pattern is reproduced in Figure 3.14 along with its original
photograph.
Figure 3.13: Drawing of a stone circle at Junapani. North is to the top of the figure.
Figure 3.14: Cup-marked stone and its sketch.
In Figure 3.2, we have given the picture of one of the stone circles. The stone
circles are large enough to be seen in Google Earth images (Figure 3.12). Abbas et



51
al. (2010) surveyed and mapped 56 stone circles at Junapani. Twenty of these
circles had stones with cup marks on them.
In Figure 3.15, we have given the histogram of the diameter of stone circles
and the number of cup-marks in each circle. We have analysed the location of the
cup mark with respect to their occurrence in the circle.
Figure 3.15: Number of cup-marks and histogram of diameter of the stone circles.
The cup-marks tend to be in either a straight line or in the form of the ‘+’ sign.
In addition, the line or one of the lines of the ‘+’ sign tend to be radial or tangential to
the circle. In Figure 3.16 we have shown the distribution of the cup-mark stones
around the circle. The cup-mark stones are not randomly placed. They seem to have
a definite orientation. They form three clusters:
1) Cluster 1: Angle 118 + 18 degrees from north
2) Cluster 2: Angle 208 + 18 degrees from north
3) Cluster 3: Angle 334 + 30 degrees from north



52
In Figure 3.17 we have given the orientation of cup-marks along the three
major clusters of cup-mark stones.
Figure 3.17: Stone cup mark direction and their location along stone circles.
All this seems to suggest that the stone circles of Junapani seem to have cup
mark stones put at specific location pointing to some specific directions. It needs to
be analysed if these are astronomy related or only direction oriented.

53
3.4 Megaliths and Astronomy
Megaliths are the product of a cultural practice that prevailed in India during the Iron
Age, mostly to mark the site of a burial or to commemorate dead persons. But the
purposes for which the megalithic monuments that do not fit into these categories
were erected remain unknown. At least some of these monuments, especially the
stone alignments or avenues, have been demonstrated to have intentional
astronomical sightlines. Though we have loosely called them “observatories”, it is
only intended that they were purposely aligned to points on the horizon such as the
points of sunrise and sunset on the solstices and equinoxes. These alignments may
have had only ritualistic significance or they may have been used to make
observations that helped mark time and the seasons. In this context, it must be
mentioned that intentional alignments, if indeed they existed, to bright stars cannot
be verified today due to effects of precession. Due to the precession of the
equinoxes, the points on the horizon where bright stars rise or set varies with time
and given the large uncertainty in the dating of these monuments, it is impossible to
speculate on the rise/set points of stars they might have pointed to. However, it can
be stated with a high degree of confidence that at least some megalithic monuments
incorporated deliberate alignments of astronomical nature for purposes that we can
only guess at today.



54
4. Astronomical Myths of India
As discussed earlier (section 2.1) myths are created from an important emotional
need of humanity and a common identity can be created through shared myths. In
this chapter we discuss the astronomical beliefs of tribal and mainstream Indians that
have been perpetuated as myths.
4.1 Astronomy of Some Indian Tribes
Before we turn to mainstream astronomy of India, it is worth looking at the astronomy
of some Indian tribes (see e.g. Vahia and Halkare, 2013 and Vahia et al., 2014).
India has a large number of tribes who maintain their own traditions and ancient
beliefs. While no comprehensive study of the astronomy of these tribes is available,
three tribes in central India, namely Banjara, Kolam and Gond have been studied. A
comparison of these tribes is given in the Table 4.1.
Table 4.1: A comparison of the social aspect of the three Indian tribes.

Approach to nature Indifferent; they rely on terrestrial signals to predict the upcoming monsoon.
Sensitive to all aspects of nature, particularly in foraging.
Very reverential and sensitive.



55
Astronomy Simplest astronomy that barely goes beyond the beliefs of others except for finding jewellery in the sky. Surprisingly, they do not use astronomy for travel.
Extensive, if a somewhat generalised visualisation of the sky in the sense that they do not seem to record changes in the sky over the year, and they recall the sky only during the immediate pre-monsoon period when it is well observed.
Fairly extensive. Regarding farming, they have a myth that Ursa Major was not allowed to sleep, suggesting that they remember it being circumpolar. From precession calculations it can be shown that this happened more than 3,000 years ago. Stories of all aspects of life are found in the sky. Predictive astronomy Not very sensitive. Pegasus delivers water.
Extensive and used even today. Treatment of dead Buried the dead and then they were forgotten. Ancestors were worshipped as a group twice a year.
Buried the dead but remembered them regularly every year and on important occasions. Graves marked by stones.
Buried and remembered as a group. Graves marked by stones.
Stories of origin Firmly remember a relation to the Rajputs. Others claim Harappan ancestry.
Cannot recall much. Worked as priests for the Gonds in AD 1200.

Most of the observations of the sky relates to the sky seen in the period close
to the monsoon season – from March till July. They seem to assume that the sky is
the same at other periods or do not bother to look at the sky. This indifference to the
sky is also interesting in the sense that even though visually striking, these societies
do not seem to be impressed by it as a matter of curiosity. None of the tribes seem
to keep track of the movement of the rising (or setting) point of the Sun in the sky
over the year. This is in variance with the fact that south India seems to be rich with
megalithic observatories (Vahia et al., 2011, Menon and Vahia, 2011).
Kolams have been traditionally foragers. They seem to have a lot more to say
about the sky in a nebulous manner. The long tradition of farming amongst Gonds is
evident in their beliefs of all aspects of astronomy and religion. Kolams have an
elaborate procedure of sky observation to predict monsoon (Figure 4.1).
Figure 4.1: Method used by Kolams to predict monsoon.



59
The general indifference of Banjaras to the sky (except a rich piece of
jewellery in Pleiades) is also visible in the study. Clearly, the relation of humans with
the sky is a reflection of the human’s relation to the land.
4.2 Traditional Astronomical Myths of India
Attitude of Indians towards the heavens and their cosmogony has evolved with time.
Mythological stories have been rendered, reinterpreted and re-ordered. Here we
briefly discuss some of the most common aspects of the relation of people of the
subcontinent with the heavens.
Hinduism is renowned for a large number of gods. However, at a
fundamental level, lies the great formless god often referred to as Brahman. He is all
pervading and all creation arose from his pure thought. After creating the universe,
he felt lonely. Hence, he created life and the living, and in particular the male
female dichotomy. However, this formless one is not worshipped. Below him are the
trinity of gods called Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh or Shiva. Brahma is the creator
and often confused with the Great Brahman. Vishnu is the preserver and often
comes to the earth in human form to assist humans. Each has a mythological story
associated with it but we shall not deal with them here since they are not related to
astronomy. Shiva is a complex but destructive god. Below them is the entire plethora
of other gods connected to each other in many ways. For a comprehensive review of
Indian myths see O’Flaherty (1975), Danielou (1991), Pattanaik (2003) and
Mukhopadhyay (2008).
4.3 Astronomical Stories
4.3.1 Story of Eclipses
Once upon a time, the warrior god Indra and other gods incurred the wrath of the
great sage Durvasa. Durvasa had given a garland to Indra who carelessly gave it to
his elephant who trampled on it. Upset by this casual treatment of his gift, Durvasa
cursed Indra and other gods that they would lose their immortality and their kingdom.
Frightened by the consequences of this, they approached Lord Vishnu for help.
Vishnu advised them that they can regain their original stature if they consume the
nectar of immortality (Amrit) from the bottom of the ocean of milk. The task was a



60
mammoth one and they realised that in order to get the Amrit, they needed the help
of their arch foes, the Asuras with whom they had a long war of dominance over the
affairs of humans. The gods called a truce with the Asuras and offered to churn the
ocean together and share the outcome. The gods and the Asuras churned the ocean
together using the serpent Vasuki belonging to the Asuras as a churning rope and
the mount Mandara as the churning staff. When the pressure of the churning shaft
became too difficult to bear, Vishnu appeared as a tortoise in one of his incarnations
and took the load on his back.
Devas and Asuras continued churning the Kshirsagar and 14 precious objects
(called “14 jewels”) surfaced one after the other11. They are
1) Chandra (Moon) which Lord Shiva put over his head, 2) Parijaat tree that was accepted by the Devas, 3) Airavat (White elephant) that became Lord Indra’s vehicle, 4) Kamdhenu (Cow) that fulfils all wishes of her owner was accepted by the Devas,
5) Sura (Alcoholic drink) that was accepted by the Danavas, 6) Kalpavriksha (Tree) that fulfils wishes of a person standing under it and was accepted by the Devas, 7) Rambha (Beautiful dancer) that was accepted by the Devas, 8) Uchhaishrava (Horse) that was accepted by the Devas, 9) Laxmi (Goddess of wealth) who married Lord Vishnu, 10) Panchajanya (Conch-shell) that became the musical instrument of Lord Indra,
11) Mace and bow, that became weapons of Lord Indra, 12) Kaustubha (Jewel) that was accepted by the Devas, 13) Dhanvantari (Doctor and founder of medical science) became a god himself 14) Amrit (Nectar).
Eventually, the nectar of immortality came out of the ocean, carried out by
Dhanvantar, the physician of the gods. The Asuras immediately took charge of the
pot. Vishnu again came to the rescue of the Devas in the form of a beautiful damsel,
Mohini and distracted the Asuras. She then retrieved the potion and distributed it to
the Devas. By the time the Asuras realised Vishnu’s tricks, it was too late, as the
Devas regained their renowned prowess and defeated them.
When Amrit was being served to the gods, an Asura, disguised as a god, sat
between the Sun and the Moon in an attempt to procure the nectar. When his
11 See Wikipedia entry on Samudra manthan.



61
presence was detected by the Sun and the Moon, Lord Vishnu immediately severed
his head from his body. Unfortunately, it was not fast enough, for the Asura had
already tasted a small quantity of the nectar and had become immortal. Ever since,
this Asura is said to wreak vengeance on the Sun and the Moon. The Asura
continuously pursues them and tries to eat them up whenever they come near. The
head of this Asura is known as Rahu and his tail is known as Ketu. Rahu causes the
eclipses. However, since Rahu has an open oesophagus, the swallowed Sun and
Moon soon emerge from the Asura’s body. Hence, in Hindu astrology Rahu and Ketu
are known as two invisible planets. They are enemies of the Sun and the Moon,
since they swallow the Sun or the Moon causing the eclipses. Hence, they are
considered inauspicious.
In later evolution of the myth, Rahu and Ketu are defined as the ascending
and descending nodes of the ecliptic and equator. When the Sun and the Moon
come together at these points, we get solar eclipse at ascending node and lunar
eclipse at descending node. Their mathematical equations were set up by the time of
Aryabhata (around 500 AD) and eclipses have been accurately calculated thereafter.
4.3.2 Orion Myths
4.3.2.1 Creation Myth
One of the interesting aspects of Indian mythology is its internal ambiguity. On the
one hand, the Universe is created by a Brahman who produces the entire universe
from his own thought. This Great One is later left ambiguous while the importance of
various gods keeps changing. In the earliest myths, Indra is the most important god
and a warrior god but his significance falls in later literature when the Great Trinity of
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva take over. However, various other gods and goddesses
continue to occupy their own important roles. In fact, Brahma and Vishnu are not
worshipped directly. Brahma has very few temples dedicated to him. Vishnu is
worshipped in the form of his incarnations such as Rama, Krishna or Narasimha.
Shiva is the only member of the Trinity who is worshipped directly. Shiva himself was
originally referred to as Rudra (the angry one or the one who makes you cry). It is
this Rudra form that has an interesting astronomical association. We return to this
subject in section 4.4.2 when we discuss the origin of life according to Indian
mythology.



62
In some variants of this story, the brightest star in Taurus, Aldeberan (Rohini)
is the female deer, Orion is Prajapati, and the three stars that form belt of Orion in
the western myths, represent the arrow that pierced him. The three stars in the belt
are: Agni (fire), Soma (a celestial drink or Moon), and Vishnu, the supreme god. In
this visualisation, Sirius and Aldeberan represent the hunter. We discuss this in
section 4.4.2.
4.3.2.2 Skanda and the Mahabharata
In Mahabharata, Orion was the warrior, Skanda. Skanda was the six headed son of
Shiva. He was both the god of war and the General of the Gods. Riding a red
crested peacock and blowing fearful sounds on a conch-shell, he thrust his spear
into the White Mountain. The top split off into the sky and became the Milky Way.
The hero also killed various demons and restored peace. In the sky he is situated
near Krittika (the Pleiades) – the six sisters who raised him.
4.3.2.3 Orion and the Dove
In another version of the story, Orion is a hunter who is waiting on top of a tree for a
hunt when he sees a beautiful deer. As he aims his arrow at the deer, the deer
pleads with him that while it is a legitimate catch of the hunter, it has a small baby at
home and the deer would be grateful if he gave the deer a chance to meet its baby
one last time before its death. The hunter lets her go, not expecting the deer to
return. However, while sitting on the tree, unwittingly he keeps taking leaves from the
Bilva tree and dropping them on the ground where there is a small Shiva Linga. The
Bilva leaves are particularly precious to Shiva who is pleased with this worship. The
deer keeps its word and returns to die by the arrow of the hunter. Touched by this
scene of valour, decency and commitment to honesty, Shiva transfers them to the
heavens as Orion and Taurus.
4.3.3 Ursa Major and the Pleiades
In Indian mythology, the seven central stars of Big Dipper (part of Ursa Major) that
form the shape of a spoon, are referred to as Saptarshi meaning seven (sapta)
sages (rishis). These are Vasistha, Bharadvaja, Jamadagni, Gautama, Atri,
Visvamitra and Agastya. These seven Rishis are often mentioned in later works as



63
typical representatives of the character and spirit of the pre-historic or mythical
period. Their astronomical designations are given in the Table 4.4 below.
Table 4.4: Indian names of the seven stars of Big Dipper.
Indian Name Bayer Designation Western Name
Kratu α UMa Dubhe
Pulaha β UMa Merak
Pulastya γ UMa Phecda
Atri δ UMa Megrez
Angiras ε UMa Alioth
Vasishtha ζ UMa Mizar
Bhrigu η UMa Alkaid
However, Agni developed a desire for their wives and wanted to seduce them.
On the other hand a minor goddess or nymph wanted to marry Agni. She therefore
took the form of six of the seven wives of the Saptarshi’s and mated with Agni.
However, the seven rishis themselves, uncertain about the chastity of their wives,
divorced them and they went on to become the Kritika or Pleiades. Only Arundhati,
wife of Vasishta remained loyal to her husband and they are the only visual binary
system in Big Dipper (α UMa).
In other variations, Kritika or Pleiades are six in number and not related to
Saptarshi at all. They are the adopted mothers of Kartikeya. Kartikeya is sometimes
mentioned as one of the two sons of Shiva but there are other suggestions including
Kartikeya being the son born of Agni and Swaha. These six women together brought
up Kartikeya and hence together they were called Kritikas. Witzel (1999) also
discusses the relation between Pleiades and the Vedic literature.
4.4 Cosmogony
In its earliest format, Vedic Hinduism is a tripartite relation between humans, gods
and ancestors. The most prominent deities of Vedic Hinduism are Indra (heroic god
of bravery and valour) Agni (fire), Soma (ritual drink), Vishvadevas (gods of all the
worlds), Asvins (gods’ horsemen), Varuna (sky, water and celestial ocean), Maruts
(Storm god), Mitra (patron divinity of honesty, friendship, contracts and meetings),
Ushas (Dawn). These are essentially terrestrial gods connected to it directly in terms
of their manifestation. They do not refer directly to heavens. In that sense, the
earliest form of Vedic Hinduism is more focused on the earthly reality.



64
4.4.1 Origin of the Universe
Rig Veda speculates on the origin of the Universe in the following manner (Panikkar
1983, p. 58):
1. At first was neither Being nor Non-being. There was not air nor yet sky beyond. What was its wrapping? Where? In whose protection? Was water there, unfathomable and deep?
2. There was no death then, nor yet deathlessness; of night or day there was not any sign. The One breathed without breath, by its own impulse. Other then that was nothing else at all.
3. Darkness was there, all wrapped around in darkness, And all was water indiscriminate: Then That which was hidden by the Void, that One, emerging, Stirring, through power of Ardor, came to be.
4. In the beginning Love arose, Which was the primal germ cell of the mind. The Seers, searching in their hearts with wisdom, Discovered the connection of Beings with Nonbeing.
5. A crosswire line cut Being from Nonbeing. What was described above it, what below? Bearer of seed there were and mighty forces, Thrust from below and forward move above.
6. Who really knows? Who can presume to tell it? Whence was it born? Whence issued this creation? Even the Gods came after its emergence. Then who can tell from whence it came to be?
7. That out of which creation has arisen, Whether it held it firm or it did not, He who surveys it in the highest heaven, He surely knows – or maybe He does not!
Rig Veda X, 129
In this poem, the poet goes well beyond the natural boundaries of religious
exploration of the world. In the final verse, the poet suggests that the origin of the
universe is unknowable except perhaps to the ultimate creator who also created later
gods, but then suspecting that the origin was in pure thought, and is not sure if even
the Original One knows. As has been visualised in other mythologies, the universe is



65
also visualised to have arisen from Hiranyagarbha (the Golden Egg, the ultimate
primordial cocoon from which the entire universe arise).
4.4.2 Origin of Life
In the original myth of creation, Prajapati (a name here used in reference to the
Great Bramhan) developed a desire for his own daughter (often called Ushas or
dawn). Interestingly, the mother of Ushas is never mentioned. But this incestuous
relation appalled the other gods. They approached Rudra to prevent this incest from
occurring. On the other hand, Ushas herself, embarrassed by this attention, kept
changing her form but each time Prajapati also took the equivalent male form out of
his desire for her. One of the forms that Prajapati takes is that of an antelope. The
Orion – Taurus constellations are the constellations depicting this conflict between
Rudra and Prjapati as the former tries to prevent the incest. The antelope’s head is
the modern constellation, Capricorn and Prajapati is Taurus. Orion the hunter, with
bow and arrow is Rudra trying to stop Prajapati from committing this sin. In variants
of this myth, the seed of the father falls on the ground and fertilises the earth and
there are other elaborate stories about the anger of Rudra (Kramrisch 1981, p. 27).
In some variants of this story, the brightest star in Taurus, Aldeberan (Rohini)
is the female deer, Orion is Prajapati, and the three stars that form belt of Orion in
the western myths, represent the arrow that pierced Prajapati. The three stars in the
belt are named after three other gods who assisted Rudra: Agni (fire), Soma (a
celestial drink or Moon), and Vishnu (the supreme god). In this visualisation, Sirius
and Aldeberan represent the hunter.
4.4.3 Structure of the Universe
From these earliest speculations, as time progresses, various seers have added
clarifications and explored other ideas about the cosmogony. In Brihadaranyaka
Upanishad (6th Brahmana text dated to 8th and 7th Century BC), Yagnavalkya
describes Universe to Gargi in the following terms:
 Everything on earth is wrapped in water  Water is wrapped in air  Air is wrapped in the sky  The sky is wrapped in the world of Gandharvas (planets)



66
 The world of Gandharvas is wrapped in Aditya (Sun)  The world of Sun is wrapped in the world of Chandra (Moon)  The world of Moon is wrapped in the world of Nakshatra  The world of Nakshatra is wrapped in the world of Devas  The world of Deva’s is enclosed in the world of Indra  The world of Indra is wrapped in the world of Prajapati  The world of Prajapati is wrapped in the world of Bramhan
This multi-layered universe is a common theme to cosmogony of not only
Hinduism but also to Jainism and Buddhism both of which arose from the same
intellectual pool of 5th century BC.
4.4.4 Origin and Nature of Time
One of the most conspicuous aspects of Hindu cosmogony is the concept of Time. A
poem in Atharva Veda (Panikkar 1983, p 217) dwells on the nature of Time in the
following manner in Purnakumbha Sukta (AV XIX, 53).
Time drivers like a horse with seven reins, A thousand eyed, un-aging stallion. Him the inspired poets mount. All beings are his chariot wheels. (53 – 1)
Time, draws this chariot with seven wheels Seven are the hubs; its axle is immortality At the head of all beings, Time proceeds Unceasingly, the first amongst Gods. ( 53 – 2)
Above Time is the a set of brimful vessel. Simultaneously we see Time here, there, everywhere. Set face to face with all existence, Time is throned, men say, in the loftiest realm (53 – 3)
Time has gathered together all beings that are; He has passed through all the gathered beings. He who was father has become their son There is no glory higher than this. (53 – 4)
Time generated the Sky above And this vast Earth. The passing moments, Present and future, by set swinging, Are reckoned out in due proportions. (53 – 5)
Time brought forth fate-filled chance. In Time the Sun shines and burns. In Time the eye spies from afar. In time all existences are. (53 – 6)



67
In time is consciousness and life, In time is concentrated name. By time, when he draws close at hand, All creatures with gladness filled. (53 – 7)
In Time is energy, in Time the highest good. In time is the Holy Utterance. Time is the lord of all there is, The Father, he, of the Creator (53 - 8)
Sent forth by him, from him, all this Was born. On him is it established. So soon as he has become Brahman, Time supports the highest Deity. (53 - 9)
Time created the creatures, Time Created in the beginning the Lord of creatures. From Time comes Self Existent. Energy likewise from Time derives.
This continues in the next verse called Kala (long scale of Time) as:
From Time came into being the Waters, From time the Holy Word, Energy and regions. By time the Sun rises In time he goes to rest again (54 – 1).
By Time blows the cleansing Wind, Through time the vast Earth has her being. The great Heaven has his post in time. (54 – 2).
Their son Time long ago engendered The things that were and that shall be. From Time came Scriptures into being And formulas of Sacrifice (54 – 3).
By Time was Sacrifice inaugurated, Inexhaustible oblation to the Gods. In time live the spirits and nymphs. Upon Time all the worlds repose (54 –4).
In time are set this Angiras12 And Atharvan4 who came from Heaven, Both this world and the world above. All holy worlds and holy interspaces (54 – 5).
12 The sages Angiras and Atharvan are credited with formulating the Atharva Veda. Since Vedas are the preaching of the Great lord heard by Great sages, these sages heard and reproduced the Atharva Veda from which this poem is taken.



68
Having conquered the worlds by the Holy Word, Time, the God Supreme, goes on (54 - 6)
This poetic imagery of time is beautiful in its own right. It is acknowledged that
Time is universal and the father of all. But he ends up being the son of his own
creation, obeying their wishes like a good son. And yet, he remains the supreme god
who goes well beyond the period of his own creations. This self-contradictory nature
of time is beautifully illustrated in this poem.
4.4.5 Yugas
In the oldest Indian document Rig Veda dated to between 2000 and 1500 BC, the
unit of time is of a year of 360 days divided into 12 months with two intercalary
months every five years to synchronise solar and lunar calendars (Narahari Achar,
1977). However, in later literature, the concept of Yuga is expanded significantly and
it takes the form of four distinct Yugas that make one day of Brahma(n) in a cycle
that repeats for several Mahayugas. The four Yugas are, Krita Yuga of 1,728,000
years duration, Treta Yuga of 1,296,000 years duration, Dvapara Yuga of 864,000
years duration and the current Kali Yuga of 432,000 year duration. Aryabhata
calculated that the Kali Yuga began on the night of February 18-19, 3102 BC. He
based this on his calculation of last great planetary conjunction that, according to
him, occurred on that day. However, today we know that his ephemeris was in error
and there was no conjunction on this date13.
4.4.6 Jaina Astronomy
One of the important collections of astronomical ideas in this period is in the form of
Jain astronomical text Suryaprajnapti. Jain sect arose in India in the first millennium
BC as a revivalist movement in India and even today is a separate religion with a lot
of commonality with Hinduism. Suryaprajnapti is divided into 20 books and is
completely free of Greek influence, which comes to India in the first millennium of the
Common Era. Sen (2009) has discussed various aspects of Jain astronomy. We
summarise from his work.
13 The date of conjunction can be calculated based on the error tolerance one allows for angular separation within this conjunction.



69
Jain astronomy consists of two Suns, Moons and two sets of nakshatras. This
becomes essential since in the Jain cosmogony, Earth is a series of flat concentric
rings of land masses separated by concentric ocean rings. The central circle is the
Jambudvipa (Jambu island) with Mount Meru in the centre. Mount Meru is the axis
along with the celestial sphere (Earth) rotates. Jambudvipa is encircled by an ocean
of salt. Beyond this lies Dhatuki Dvipa encircled by the black ocean Kalodadhi and
beyond that is Pushkara Dvipa rimmed by impassable mountain range of
Manusottara Parvata. Bharatavarsha or India occupies the southernmost part of the
Jambudvipa. The Sun, Moon and the stars are assumed to move in circles parallel to
the earth’s surface with Mount Meru as the centre. Jambudvipa is divided into four
quarters and four directions. The Sun goes from one quarter to another marking the
beginning of a day. Since the average length of a day is 12 hours, the same Sun,
after making day over Bharatavarsha in the southern quarter cannot reappear the
following morning, as it still has to travel three quarters (36 hours) to travel. To
overcome this problem, two Suns, Moons and two sets of constellations were
envisaged (Sen, 2009).
4.5 Sun, Moon Planets and Stars
Indian mythology mentions 9 wanderers in the sky - Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus,
Mars Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu. Of these the first seven obvious wanderers in
the sky are common to most other knowledge systems while Rahu and Ketu are
considered ‘dark planets’. We describe them below in accordance with the Hindu
mythology (Svoboda 1997).
4.5.1 Sun
One of the most revered gods in Rig Veda, Sun is an eagle traversing the space, or
a mottled bull or a white brilliant steed brought up by Dawn who is also referred to as
his wife. He is the gem of the sky and alternately the son of Dyaus (sky or heavens).
Surya is the chief solar deity in Hinduism. He is one of the Adityas who are sons of
Kashyapa and Aditi. Surya has hair and arms of gold. He is said to drive through the
heaven in his triumphal chariot harnessed by seven horses or one horse with seven
heads, which represent the seven colours of the rainbow or the seven chakras.
Sunday is named after him.



70
In Hindu religious literature, Surya is notably mentioned as the visible form of
god that one can see every day. His other names include Arka, Aditya, Bhanu,
Bhaskar, Divakar, Grahapati, Mitra, Pusha, Ravi, Savita and Vivasvan.
4.5.2 Moon
Moon is also an important god from early period. From ancient times, the lunar
calendar was the most important calendar in India that was eventually merged into a
luni – solar calendar. Hence, in Indian mythologies the zodiacal belt is divided into 27
separate lunar mansions rather than the 12 zodiacal signs. Moon has 27 wives
(since with respect to distant stars, Moon completes one rotation in 27 days). The 27
wives (who are sisters of each other) are listed starting with Pleiades (Kritika) but his
favourite wife is Aldebaran (Rohini). According to Hindu mythology, this favouritism
causes a lot of unhappiness amongst his other wives and they complain to their
father, who, after two warnings, curses him with progressive wasting of his body.
After much pleading by the Moon, eventually the father agrees that this wasting will
be periodic and he will recover from this as long as he treats all his wives fairly.
Hence the Moon waxes and wanes. Another interesting myth involved Ganesha and
Moon. Moon chided Ganesha for being fat and using mouse as a vehicle. Fed up
with this continuous chiding, Ganesha broke one of his tusks and threw it at the
Moon. Hence many idols of Ganesha have one broken tooth.
4.5.3 Mercury
Mercury is the crest jewel of nine planets because of its extraordinary prowess. He is
the most intelligent planet of all and removes obstacles of those who worship him.
He causes no inauspicious events. His colour is green. But Mercury only is
auspicious when in conjunction with auspicious planets and malefic with malefic
planets. He is the son of Moon and Jupiter’s wife with whom Moon had an improper
relationship. He was born of an aborted pregnancy.
4.5.4 Venus
Venus is the god with the knowledge of bringing the dead to life. He is the teacher of
Asuras, the enemies of gods. He is medium sized, well nourished, virile, intelligent,
handsome and sensuous.



71
4.5.5 Mars
Mars is exceedingly cruel and as sharp as a blade. He is intolerant of anyone who
worships him with arrogance and destroys such a person’s family and prosperity.
Those who worship him regularly with humility, following the appropriate rituals, are
blessed, gain wealth and are free from diseases. To worship him, one must wear red
clothes, use red flowers and eat food only once a day, which is red in colour such as
wheat.
4.5.6 Jupiter
Jupiter is the king amongst planets. He is the teacher of several gods and his name
is synonymous (Guru) to a teacher. He is yellow in colour and is big bellied with a
broad chest. He is the possessor of all virtues.
4.5.7 Saturn
Saturn is a supremely terrifying god. He can be terrifying when angry and benevolent
when pleased. But he is most well-known for his ability to destroy. Shani is a deva
and son of Surya (the Hindu Sun god) and his wife Chhaya (Shadow goddess) and
hence known as Chayyaputra. He is the elder brother of Yama, the Hindu god of
death, who in some scriptures corresponds to the deliverance of justice.
Interestingly, Surya has two sons, Shani and Yama. Shani gives us the results of
one's deeds through one's life by appropriate punishments and rewards. Yama
brings one face to face with the results of one's deeds after death.
It is said that when Shani opened his eyes as a baby for the very first time, the
Sun went into an eclipse, which clearly denotes the impact of Shani on astrological
charts. He is known as the greatest teacher. Shani deva is said to be very harmful to
those who follow the path of betrayal, backstabbing and unjust revenge. He is known
in Hindu scriptures as the most malevolent as well as the most amiable. He is
depicted as dark in colour, clothed in black, holding a sword, arrows and two
daggers and mounted on a black crow.



72
4.5.8 Rahu, Ketu and Eclipses
Rahu and Ketu are considered to be ‘dark planets’ in Indian mythology. However,
from the original belief of demons trying to eat up the Sun and the Moon, the concept
continued to develop.
With the arrival of mathematical astronomy formalised by Aryabhata around
500 AD, Rahu and Ketu were defined as ascending and descending nodes of the
points at which Sun’s and Moon’s orbit meet. Their location is calculated along with
the distances of Sun and Moon from these points (Figure 4.2). Eclipse is therefore
predicted based the merger of the location of Sun, Moon and Rahu. By calculating
the vertical drift of the disc of the Sun and the Moon from the mean line of the
motion, the nature of eclipses (total, partial or annular) can be calculated
(Balachandra Rao and Venugopal, 2008) .
Figure 4.2: Rahu and Ketu in their astronomical interpretation and images.
4.5.9 Pole star
The Pole Star is called Dhruva in Hindu mythology. Dhruva was the son of king
Uttānapāda and his wife Suniti (or Sunrita). The king also had another son Uttama,
born to his second queen Suruchi, who was the king’s favourite wife. Once, when
Dhruva was five years of age, the two princes playfully raced towards their father's
lap. But, Suruchi chided Dhruva and insulted him for trying to woo the attention of his



73
father since he was not her son. She further asked him to redeem himself by seeking
Vishnu's blessings.
Suniti consoled the distraught child, by asking him to ignore Suruchi and
meditate about Lord Vishnu. Dhruva started his penance, and went without food and
water for six months, his mind fixed on the Lord. Pleased with his austerity, Lord
Vishnu appeared before him. Seeing the Lord before him, he prostrated himself
before the Lord.
When Vishnu was pleased with Dhruva's austerity and granted him a boon.
Dhruva said that that he did not know how to sing the praise of Lord Vishnu, and
therefore asked the boon of knowledge. Pleased with this, Lord Vishnu told this five
year old child that he would be great and wise king on earth and on his death he will
be immortalised with the most revered seat of Pole Star. The Saptarshis also remain
close to and associated with the location of Dhruva.
Since his original journey began when he was displaced from his father’s lap,
he also asked for a boon that he should be so seated in the sky that he cannot be
displaced from his position. Hence he is the Pole Star.

5. Astronomy and Civilisation
It could be argued that advancement in astronomical knowledge of a culture primarily
depends on the following factors:
1) Requirements of the society
2) Available technology
3) State of intellectual development of the people
All these factors vary with time. The first two of these are more or less
monotonic, with both requirements of the society and available technology becoming
more sophisticated with time. We briefly discuss each of these below.
Requirements of a society increase with time. The requirement can change
gradually or in sudden bursts as societies become more sophisticated. In the hunter
gatherer phase, for example, rough ideas about animal migratory patterns and
seasonal variations in warmth are sufficient. With the advent of farming, high
sensitivity to seasons emerges (Vahia and Yadav, 2011b). Farming requires more
precise knowledge and predictability of seasons and sunrise point. Once a society
acquires a certain level of sophistication and wealth, preservation of wealth, good
fortune and the desire to pass on the wealth and good fortune to their offspring result
in development of astrology and related studies. Once a civilisation reaches a level
of sophistication, where it has enough resources to spare and stability to pursue pure
curiosity, scattered ideas of cosmogony and other fields begin to attract serious
attention.
Available technology is a predictable parameter based on the general
technological sophistication of the culture. A specific, inspired piece of technology
can result in a critical sudden spurt in development and history is replete with such
examples. Development of astronomical monuments, sun dials and clocks are
examples of this kind. Nevertheless, even without such sudden spurts, all societies
either acquire or circumvent the needed technology and broadly move towards
higher level of sophistication.
As against this, the state of intellectual development of people is a matter of
greatest uncertainty and is practically unpredictable. Given a broad idea of the



75
intellectual calibre of the most influential people, their influence on the advancement
of knowledge can be estimated. Occasionally extraordinary geniuses arise in the
societies. They can produce dramatic changes. However, it is impossible to predict
when such persons will arise in any society. Individuals with such profound insights
are a result of the intellectual traditions, existing environment, technological
sophistication of the society, expectations from the society and personal upbringing.
In societies such as the Indian one, with a poor sense of history, most records of
important individuals are missing and often they existence has to be inferred from
the ideas that emerge at any time. In spite of this limitation, a general idea that
people become increasingly sophisticated with time will permit some measure of
predictability on the growth of astronomy in a culture.
In all this, we disregard sudden catastrophic social and ecological changes
which can set societies back by centuries if not millennia. We also implicitly ignore
cross-cultural spread of knowledge which can also allow civilisation to make
dramatic transitions to higher levels of learning and sophistication by borrowing the
learning of other cultures. While these induced changes are often conspicuous, it is
often not appreciated that such sudden spurts can only be introduced to civilisations
already prepared (or due) for such spurt of knowledge and external infusion only
accelerates the process of knowledge gain rather than change the track of the
civilisation.
In light of the above discussion, we can identify four major phases of transition
in the evolution of astronomy (Vahia and Yadav 2011a). These are:
1. Initial phase: Marking of sunrise and seasons.
2. Settlement phase: Marking of stars and constellations.
3. Civilisation phase: Development of astrology and cosmogony.
4. Technology based phase: Modern astronomy with all its trappings.
We discuss these phases in detail below, taking examples from the Indian
civilisation. The time duration during which a culture remains in a specific phase is
very specific to the culture and depends on other related and unrelated
developments that guide the course of the culture. The duration for which each
culture remains in a particular phase depends on its specific factors discussed



76
above. In addition each of these phases will include multiple subcultures, parallel
developments and fundamentally different approaches. However these distinctions
can be classified into two groups. One group would include development of
technologies while the other would include intellectual growth and flight of
imagination. The two groups may not be distinct and their activities may overlap.
Also the activities of the two groups may not be in parallel. In Indian case itself as we
shall see below, the astronomical knowledge of builders of earliest observatories and
records in Vedic literature (Vedanga Jyotisa) are similar. In the Indian context the
earliest megalithic structures incorporating astronomical knowledge are dated to
have been built well before 1000 BC, the Vedic literature is dated to a period
between 1500 and 800 BC and the urban phase of Harappan civilisation is dated to
between 2600 and 1900 BC. However, in our discussion below we refer to megalithic
and Vedic culture as phase 2 while the (poorly known) Harappan astronomy would
have been closer to the astronomy of a civilisation. Hence, even within broadly the
same landmass different groups may be at different levels of sophistication and may
have borrowed knowledge and ideas from each other.
There may also be uneven growth in different aspects of astronomy.
According to the general belief of the Rig Veda being a product of a pastoral people
from Indo-Iranian region, astronomy in it should be classified as phase 2 astronomy.
However, given the level of sophistication of their cosmogonical ideas (such as
Nasadiya Sukta), it is more akin to phase 3 astronomy.
While discussing each phase we discuss traditions of the culture that fit that
phase even as in the same historical time frames other cultures may be far ahead.
This is true even of 21st century India where the tribal Indians have a complete
disconnect with the urban India even though they exist in close proximity. Even now
tribal astronomy of India is reminiscent of phase 2 astronomy (Vahia et al. 2014)
while the urban astronomy is of phase 4 level.
Indian astronomy as it appears in Sanskrit texts, especially in Vedic (stage 2)
and post Siddhantic astronomy (stage 4) have been well studied. These include
books by Bose, Sen and Subbarayappa (2009), Iyengar (2008, 2013),
Subbarayappa (2008), Subbarayappa and Sarma (1985) as well as Sewell and
Dikshit (1995) on Indian Calendar, Balachandra Rao (2008), Balachandra Rao and



77
Venugopal (2008, 2009) on classical methods of calculating eclipses and transits.
Abhyankar (1991, 1993, 1996, 2002, 2005) and Iyengar (2003, 2005, 2006, 2007,
2010) are referred to in the text at appropriate places.
5.1 Initial Phase
The initial phase consists of understanding and appreciating the fact that the cycle of
the Sun is related to warmth and life and the point of sunrise decides the level of
warmth. The seasons vary depending on the location of the point of sunrise on the
horizon (Figure 5.1).
At this stage, a human group or a culture can identify the following aspects of nature:
• Identifying Sun as the source of warmth and light.
• Rains, Sun and heavens are identified as crucial life givers. Sky rejuvenates
the Earth. This becomes an everlasting image in human (even Neanderthal?)
mind.
• Due of its elegance and importance, the sky becomes the abode for the gods.
• Astronomical observations might get recorded on stones in the form of rock
art.
• This phase brings in first generation astronomy – to the level of defining
seasons and their relation to sunrise points.
In Figure 5.2, we have shown one such rock art image from Chillas in
Kashmir, which is a common form of expression of personal and social experiences
at this stage of evolution (see e.g. Lewis-Williams, 2002 for a more extensive
discussion on the Neolithic mind).
Figure 5.1: Location of sunrise point over the period of one year.



78
Figure 5.2: A rock art from Chillas, Kashmir showing the Sun god with the disk of the Sun just behind him. The division of the disk into four quadrants is probably indicative of the four seasons.
Moreover, these images can often be very sophisticated and complex making
it difficult to interpret them, but they are likely to be important in understanding
astronomical observations by ancient people.
An interesting aspect of human existence is the early artistic expressions.
These are typically of two types. The first type includes a more literal art that typically
depicts hunting scenes and sketches of animal and human forms (Lewis-Williams,
2002). The second piece of art is essentially abstract and consists of geometric
patterns of varied kind, the most common amongst them being spirals but other
rectangular geometry can also be found. Lewis-Williams (2002) assigns especially
the second type of drawing to shamanic experiences under the influence of
hallucinogens. In rare cases, we get drawings that represent far deeper presentation
of ideas and abstractions such as in the Lascaux caves where the animals imagined
in the sky are presented along with the star patterns that they represent. It is these
drawings that are a remarkable window to the intellectual capabilities of early cave
dwellers. However, in some cases it may even represent real observations. In Figure
5.3, we have shown one more drawing that seems to represent the sketch of a
mythological scene in the sky which could be a record of a supernova 7000 years
ago (Joglekar et al. 2011).



79
Figure 5.3: A stone etching from Burzahom, Kashmir. Picture copyright Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, New Delhi.
In Figure 5.3, we reproduce a stone etching found in Burzahom near Srinagar.
The drawing has been variously interpreted but generally accepted as representing a
hunting scene in the presence of bright objects overhead. However, at least four of
the five objects shown, namely the two bright objects apparently in the sky, the
hunter, the stag and the dog are all related to the sky and the last of these, namely a
person with an abnormally long spear can certainly be drawn in the sky. Joglekar et
al. (2011) shows that not only do the objects represent very commonly imagined
figures in the sky, their relative sizes and ratios all indicate a fairly consistent picture
indicating that the drawing can be interpreted as the southern sky with Orion, Taurus
and Andromeda in the sky. Joglekar et al. (2011) even go further and speculate
whether it is possible that one of the bright objects maybe an exploding star which
became as bright as the full moon for a few weeks while the other one may be the
moon.
If this is the case, the most obvious of such an object can be a supernova
(Joglekar et al., 2011) or a comet (see e.g. Strom, 2002). Since the image is
symmetrical, it was argued that it is more likely to be the former. Joglekar et al.
(2011) then searched the supernova catalogue for a possible supernova that had an
apparent magnitude comparable to that of the Sun or the Moon, was close to the
ecliptic and occurred between 0 and 10,000 BC since the rock art was dated to be
before 2000 BC. Joglekar et al. (2011) found only one supernova that satisfied all
these criteria and it was dated to around 5000 BC. By projecting the supernova on
the sky chart, they found that the hunter in the figure matched to Orion and when the
image was enlarged to fit the Orion, the other images such as the stag, the dog and



80
the other hunter fitted well with Taurus, Andromeda and Arietis - Ceti region. This
may be the first recorded supernova image (Joglekar et al., 2011). However, this is
not the only possible explanation and other possible interpretations are that it is a
simple hunting scene with two Suns indicating the movement of the Sun (Strom,
private communication). It is also possible to interpret the drawing as a presentation
of the creation of the myth of Rig Veda where the great god is about to perform an
incest with his daughter who has taken the shape of a deer and is prevented by
another great god (Rudra) (see e.g. Kramrisch, 1981, p 3). There are other such
examples where other astronomical references are discussed (Iqbal et al., 2009).
Sule et al. (2011) discusses another such example of a possible record of Kepler
Supernova.
These observations and recordings of transient events and other aspects of
the sky are therefore by people who are semi-settled. Beyond this, the human
culture becomes more settled and we get the settlement astronomy.
5.2 Settlement Phase
Once a population settles down in an area, it lives either by hunting or by farming.
With farming, they begin to be far more sensitive to the environment and its changes.
Apart from observing that the Sun does not rise exactly in the east and does not set
exactly in the west, they begin to find it necessary to keep track of the movement of
Sun, Moon and stars in the sky. They therefore evolve the following astronomical
understanding:
• Large structures are created to study the sunrise patterns. Various aspects of
Moon (and planets?) get studied.
• The difference between solar and lunar year is noticed and various methods
of synchronisation are proposed.
• Constellations, zodiacs and lunar mansions (nakshtras) are defined.
• Eclipses are noticed and attempts are made to determine their periodicity.
• Transient events such as comets are recorded.
• New myths are created to explain these observations.
• Cosmogonical ideas that speculate on the human life and its relation to the
universe emerge.



81
Settlement phase of humans are controlled entirely by resources available
within their reach. Such resources need to be rejuvenated every year and hence
settled lives are very sensitive to the seasons. The knowledge of seasons is best
derived by keeping track of the movement of the Sun over the year using anything
from a gnomon, a Sundial or something as complex as a megalithic observatory. The
choice that any culture makes would crucially depend on the environment in which
the culture grows and its resources. The origins of such practices could have
stemmed from observations of variations in the shadows cast by natural outcrops or
trees over the years. Such observations could have led to the deliberate placement
of menhirs to sue their shadows to predict the seasons. Thus an agrarian people
would have used megalithic markers to keep track of time and the seasons.
Nomadic people would have used the stars for navigational purposes.
A settlement or a culture developing in relatively resource-poor environment
would exhaust its local resources quickly and would need to be mobile. They would
therefore be dependent on the gnomons which are easy to set up and use. The
dynamics of their shadows would be highly sensitive to the latitude of the place
where they had their temporary residence. In that case, they are more likely to
develop generalised rules such as length of the year, time of solstices and northward
and southward movement of the Sun etc. As such therefore, they would have to rely
on their formalised ideas and knowledge – oral or written – of seasons and learn to
apply it to changing situations. Such cultures are more likely to keep their knowledge
in the format of literature. Here we treat both the possibilities separately.
5.2.1 Megalithic Astronomy
We first take the case of settlements in resource-rich areas that would build
megalithic structures. The megalithic structures that are marked by huge stones are
arranged in specific manner. While these may well be for ritualistic reasons, a fair
case can be made that the purpose of some of them could have been to keep track
of the movements Sun, Moon and even stars (see e.g. Baity, 1973).
All over the world are found “ancient stone structures are found that arrest the
eye and have fascinated the lay public, archaeologists and antiquarian alike for ages
because of their curious and bold appearance on the surface” of the earth (Sundara



82
1975). The word “megalith” literally means built of large stones, though some
megaliths (such as rock cut tombs) may not strictly adhere to this definition.
However, the usage of the term “megalithic” can be justified because of its antiquity
and continued popular use (Moorti 2008, 1994).
The erection of megaliths seems to have coincided with different cultural
phases in different parts of the world. The European megaliths are considered as
earliest in chronological sequence – from Neolithic (or the “New” Stone Age) to the
Bronze Age (i.e. from 5000 BC to 2000 BC) and its continuation even in the Iron Age
(Moorti 2008, 1994).
Southern parts of India have a very large number of megalithic structures. The
“south Indian megalithic complex”, is known since the first reports of “Pandu Coolies”
in Kerala by Babington (1823). The south Indian megaliths are believed to be
erected by iron-using cultures (Moorti 2008, 1994). Thousands of megalithic sites
have been discovered in southern India. Several of them have been excavated,
studied and classified; among the most celebrated study being that of Brahmagiri.
Brahmagiri has been intensively explored by M. H. Krishna in 1940 (Krishna 1942,
Ghosh 1989). Later on R. E. M. Wheeler excavated the site on behalf of the
Archaeological Survey of India in 1947 (Wheeler 1947, Ghosh 1989). Since those
days, studies of Indian megaliths have come a long way and a lot of these sites have
been systematically studied, though megaliths continue to be one of the most
perplexing problems in South Asian archaeology (Ehrich 1992).
A large majority of these monuments seem to have been used for funerary
purposes. However, the funerary aspect of this tradition is not entirely a new feature
of the Iron Age. The antiquity of burial practice in India dates back to the Mesolithic
period and marked burials begin in the Neolithic period. Though evidence for an
antecedent stage of “megalithism” is found in the pre-Iron Age context, this tradition
became very popular in the Iron Age and continued to survive into the Early Historic
and even later periods.
Moorti (2008, 1994) has provided a classification of megaliths based on their
form and perceived function. He has classified them broadly into sepulchral and non
sepulchral – the former containing the mortal remains of deceased human beings



83
and the latter lacking the same. Sepulchral monuments may be pit burials, cist
burials etc. with a variety of surface markers of stone whereas non-sepulchral
monuments consist of an assortment of various monuments that may have had
widely varying purposes. For instance, dolmens may have served as memorials, as
may have certain classes of menhirs (as memorial stones). However, there exist
several enigmatic non-sepulchral megaliths like alignments and avenues. These are
generally arranged in geometric patterns of tens to hundreds to even few thousands
of stones, which defy any explanation.
Menon and Vahia (2010) have studied several megalithic sites – both
sepulchral (related to the dead) and non-sepulchral in Karnataka and Kerala and it
seems that some of them may have astronomical relevance.
As for the sepulchral monuments, some of the earlier monuments14 either
show no definite orientation to the cardinal directions or clear N-S orientations
whereas later monuments show East – West orientations. The later monuments
show orientations within the annual range of sunrise and sunset points. This
suggests a change in the orientation the graves to the direction of sunrise or sunset
on some day of the year.
It is in the non-sepulchral monuments that some connection to astronomy
seems to be lurking, possibly as calendar devices. The stone alignments found in
present day Andhra Pradesh and northern Karnataka are well known (Allchin 1956,
Petraglia and Allchin, 2007, Paddayya 1995). These are mysterious grid-like
arrangement of stones with the grid lines oriented to the cardinal directions (or, in
some cases 15 – 20o off the cardinal directions (Allchin 1956)). Some of them
contain large numbers of stones, such as Hanamsagar (more than 2500 stones)
(Allchin 1956) – compared to the alignment at Carnac in Brittany, France by Sundara
(1975, 1995, 2004). Most of the alignments such as the one at Hanamsagar consist
of stones that are either field boulders rolled down from nearby hills and manoeuvred
into position or roughly dressed boulders. Though these have been ascribed the
function of calendar devices by Rao (2005), this needs to be verified by proper
surveys.
14 The chronological framework for south Indian megaliths is uncertain, with just over 30 reliable dates for around 3000 known sites and our judgement of “early” and “late” is on stylistic basis.



84
Recent studies have shown that these menhirs, which are either natural
boulders of elongated cross section or quarried slabs, are invariably erected with
their long axes oriented N-S and are arranged such that several pairs of these frame
the rising or setting Sun on the two solstices. In some of these sites, there are cairns
and other sepulchral megaliths in close vicinity of the menhirs. The solstitial
alignment looks intentional and the sight-lines that have been inferred are plausible
ones involving a standing observer. Further investigations need to be done as to
what exactly their purpose was, especially in light of the sepulchral megaliths close
by.
Recent investigations (Menon and Vahia, 2009) have identified more sites of
this type than earlier known. Four of the Menhir sites described by Sundara (1975,
2004) were shown to belong to this category, while one more such site has come to
light during recent explorations. It has been noticed that several single stone slabs
oriented N-S that were possibly part of alignments have been partially destroyed.
Sundara (1975) also discusses Menhirs that are great granite slabs in Kerala. Unlike
the alignments discussed by Allchin (1956) and Paddayya (1995), which consist of
boulders oriented roughly, the alignments using quarried slabs or elongated boulders
of slab-like cross section seem to have more precise orientation and alignment.
These could well have been the calendar devices of the Megalithic Age in this
region.
In Table 5.1 below, we have listed some of the alignment/avenue sites in
southern Karnataka. In Figure 5.4, we show the sunset at the first site listed in Table
5.1.

5.2.2 Vedic Astronomy
The pastoral cultures which are settled for shorter periods and maintain a mobile
lifestyle will not find it useful to build megaliths. They are more likely to formalise their
learning and keep verbal records of their observations.
The oldest of Indian literature is the Rig Veda. Its dating has been a
controversial issue but its antiquity as the earliest Indian document has not been
doubted (see e.g. Goodall, 1996). Rig Veda has elaborate discussions of rituals and
philosophy. It however, has a separate addendum called Vedanga Jyotisa or the
astronomical treatise of the Rig Veda that insists that “Just like the combs of
peacocks and the crest jewels of serpents, so does Jyotişa (astronomy) stand at the
head of the auxiliaries of the Veda” (RV - VG 35, see Subbarayappa and Sarma,
1985, p 1).
Some of the most exhaustive work on the astronomical references in Rig
Veda has been done by Narahari Achar (1999). Simulating the Vedic sky, in
conjunction with Panchanga to verify that the statements in Shatapada Bramhana
about the Kritika (Pleiades) never swerve from east, Saptarshis rising in the north



86
point he associates Rig Veda’s astronomy to events that could have been observed
around 3000 BC.
Subbarayappa and Sarma (1985) have compiled the list of astronomical
references in various ancient Indian literatures. From this, it is clear that the authors
of Rig Veda were aware of the discrepancies between the duration of lunar year and
solar year and the need to add intercalary month for synchronising the two. Rig Veda
also consists of several references to names of gods and numbers which are similar
to numbers in astronomy, such as seven Adityas (Kaye, 1998: 11) but there are no
clear astronomical references in it.
The Yajur Veda however, explicitly mentions the division of the ecliptic into 27
nakshatras or lunar mansions that are followed even today. Yajur Veda (4.4.11, see
Subbarayappa and Sarma, 1985, p 50) recommends two intercalary months in five
years. The days are named according to the phases of the Moon.
In Yajur Veda, there are references to 12 lunar months amounting to 354
days. The synchronisation was done using Ekādaśarātra ceremony. This made 365
days in a year leaving an error of 0.25 days per year. However, the Vedic year
consisted of 12 months, each of 30 days. This gives the duration of the year as 360
days. This was synchronised to the seasons simply by adding 5 days to the
calendar. Solstice days were also noted in literature. The concept of Yuga was
introduced as a more sophisticated attempt to synchronise the solar and lunar
calendars. The five Yugas were, Samvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvatsara, Anuvatsara,
and Idvatsara. Two intercalary months Amhaspati and Samsarpa were added to
complete a Yuga. While commenting on Yuga Lagadha, the author of Vedanga
Jyotisha of Yajur Veda (dated to 1350 BC, see Kuppanna Sastry, 1985) had a fairly
good idea about the year being a fraction of a day (see e.g. Narahari Achar, 1998).
Nakshtras (Lunar Mansions) are the constellations that Moon visits during a
month. However, in the present epoch, Moon does not go close to all the nakshatras.
Bhujle and Vahia (2007) suggested that this may be due to the precession of the
equinoxes which produces subtle changes in the apparent path of the Moon in the
heavens over time. Using modern astronomical software we calculated the average
distance of the path of the Moon from all the nakshatras as a function of time and



87
found that the distance was minimum around 3000 BC suggesting that the
nakshatras were probably designed around that period, when first large settlements
were beginning to emerge in the subcontinent (Jain, 2006, p 79).
At the end of the Vedic period, the Vedanga literature was created. Amongst
them was the Vedanga Jyotisa which discussed the astronomy of the period
(Kuppanna Sastrya, 1985). Conventionally dated to 1350 BC, Naharhari Achar
(2000) has suggested that based on astronomical references it should be dated to
1800 BC. It defines a period called Yuga which consists of 5 solar years, 67 lunar
sidereal cycles, 1830 days, 1835 sidereal days, 62 synodic months, 1860 Tithis (i.e.
Moon passes through the 27 Nakshatras a total of 1860 times), 135 solar nakshatras
(since Sun remains in a nakshtra for 13.55 days), 1809 lunar nakshatras (since the
Moon remains in one nakshatra for 1.01 days) and 1768 risings of the Moon
(Kuppanna Sastry, 1985, p 15, Kaye, 1998, p 18). It defines 1 Yuga as 5, years, 1
year as 12 solar months of 366 days in which there are 6 seasons. 1 day consists of
30 parts called mahuratas. 1 mahurata (equivalent to 48 minutes) consist of 2 nadis
and this time is also further divided into smaller units (cf. Subbarayappa and Sarma,
1985, p 51) of Kalas (about 2.4 min), Kastha (about 1.2 seconds), gurvaksharas
(about 0.6 seconds) and matras (about 0.12 seconds). The purpose of such small
time divisions is not very clear but was probably related to the water-clock, human
pulse measurements and duration of musical notes etc. (Kuppanna Sastry,1985, p
39). Gondhalekar (2008) has studied the method of intercalation in Vedang Jyotisha
and pointed out various methods that could have been used to synchronise lunar
and solar calendars.
Subbarayappa (2008: 69) has listed the references to various nakshatras in
Vedanga Jyotisa and the attendant deity for each of them. He has also collated
evidence (Subbarayappa 2008, p 81) showing that this system was indigenous to
Indian astronomy and given a comparative table of the various systems
(Subbarayappa, 2008, p 87-89).
One more aspect of this stage is the beginning of some basic ideas of
cosmogony. One of the verses in Rig Veda called Nasadiya Sukta, for example,
speculates on the origin of the universe (see Chapter 4). The format of Hinduism at
the time of creation of this verse was that of a tripartite relation between humans,



88
ancestors and gods (see e.g. Jamison and Witzel, 1992). Hence, gods were a part of
a group that exchanged favours with each other. Gods were not omnipotent,
everlasting representation of nature, and hence, any speculation of the origin of
universe had to go beyond the gods. Another poem with interesting insights consists
of speculations about time (Chapter 4). Kloetzli (1985) has discussed the Puranic
cosmogony including the ideas that the earth is surrounded by seven islands and
seven seas.
These kind of poetic expressions of abstract ideas about the universe,
cosmos and human place in them are typical of the period. They are also often
intimately connected to mythology of the period. Its relation to religious ceremonies
on the other hand, is not clear (Staal, 2008: 227). However, stripped of their poetic
imagery, these poems are simple, driven essentially by philosophical ideas (for a
comprehensive discussion on cosmology of Rigveda, see Wallis, 1999).
Even in this period, the astronomical observations were accurate enough to
permit dating of some of the ancient documents based on their astronomical
references (Table 5.2). However, it must be added that in many cases, the dating is
considered controversial and even the same data has been differently interpreted by
different scholars. The most interesting of these is the dating of Mahabharata.
Narahari Achar (1998) has reinterpreted a specific verse in Atharva Veda
(XIX. 53.3) and suggested that it implies the use of an out-flowing water clock for
measurement of time and perhaps, the existence of different types of water clock.
Filliozat (1962) has also discussed the connection between Indian and Iranian
astronomy in that period. Beyond this stage, this intense process of creativity and
study takes evolution of astronomy to the next phase of evolution namely that of
civilisation.
5.3 Civilisation Phase
With time, societies tend to be far more organised. With organisation comes
increased efficiency. This efficiency allows the society to specialise in tasks and
create specialists. The result is that teachers and pupils fully occupied with
generations of knowledge emerge. Such a society can then have people who spend

a lifetime studying and speculating about nature. At this stage, the disciplines of
astronomical mythology, cosmogony and astrology begin to take root. The owners of
wealth become possessive enough to become seriously worried about their future,
conservation or increase of their wealth as well as passing it on to their offspring.
Hence predicting future becomes an obsession. Astronomy, with its moving Sun,
Moon and planets, provides one of the obvious methods for predicting the future.
Astrology therefore becomes the driving force for astronomy. In the absence of other
knowledge, such activities gain certain respectability. At this stage astronomical
knowledge becomes more precise and often, the documents created in this phase
can be dated using references to astronomical observations (Table 5.2).
The society also begins a systematic reinterpretation of old scattered ideas
and creation of new ideas. The speculations about astronomy and the universe
become more sophisticated. An interesting mixture of religious beliefs, astronomy
and architecture emerge, reflecting the cosmogony of the period. With the need to
predict and calculate planetary motions and eclipses, some amount of mathematical
astronomy also arises at this stage.
Iyengar (2005, 2006, 2008, 2010) has summarised some salient features of
Hindu astronomy before the period of the Siddhāntas, which started with the
Common Era. He demonstrates that the prose text of Parāśara as preserved in the
works of Utpala and Ballāla-sena represents an ancient observational tradition of
Hindu astronomy prior to the Siddhānta period. This text called Parāśara-samhitā,
consists of planet and comet observations made around 2nd Millennium BC. The
visibility and invisibility periods of Venus are quite accurate for naked eye
observations. The sidereal periods of Jupiter and Saturn and visibility of Mercury are
given, even if they are approximate. Movement of Mars has been described
qualitatively with no numbers given in the quoted text. The list of twenty-six comets is
also given. It establishes a historical basis for the Great Flood, which has been the
starting point of much of Indian mythology. The text of Garga, as quoted in the
Adbhuta-sāgara, indicates later developments. For example, the Saptarsi era and
the Jupiter year are due to Garga. He was the first person to state that comets
appear in a cycle and to have remarked that the tail of a comet extends away from
the Sun. He also gives a few observational numbers for Mars. Existence of



90
synchronism between ancient comet names of Parāśara-samhitā and Vedic deities
suggests that comet observations were a continuing tradition from Rig Veda. Rig
Veda refers to lunar and solar eclipses. An investigation of the Rig Vedic number
3339 suggests that that this was the characteristic eclipse number of ancient India.
This represents the number of tithis between two similar lunar eclipses separated by
nearly eighteen solar years, counting only the dark fortnights.

5.3.1 Possible Time Marker of Dholavira
The Harappan Civilisation with its generous spread and general sophistication must
have had sophisticated astronomical knowledge too. However, the methods used by
Harappans to keep a record of passage of time are not clear. However, there are
some tentative suggestions about how the observations could have been done
(Vahia and Menon, 2013). At Dholavira – an important port city of the civilisation, a
curious structure was noticed in the Bailey area, west of the Citadel and slightly
lower to it. This structure is shown in Figure 5.5 below.
Figure 55.5 Possible site of time marking at Dholavira.



91
An unusual circular construction can be seen at the top of the drawing shown
in Figure 5.5 (right). Vahia and Menon (2013) have shown that by assuming 2.5m
high walls and a flat roof with an appropriately placed aperture, observations of the
patch of sunlight thrown by the aperture on the floor could offer a very convenient
time marker (see figure 5.6). Interestingly, this involves observation of the Sun while
it is on the meridian, not at the horizon. While it is it cannot be said with a high
degree of confidence that this structure was indeed an observatory, this remains the
only explanation advanced at present for the unusual construction of the structure.
Figure 5.6: Possible design of the time marking structure at Dholavira.
5.3.2 Post Vedic Astronomy
Several complex ideas can be seen in the astronomy of the late Vedic period. Sule
et al. (2007) have discussed the Saptarshi calendar that a priori seems to have no
astronomical justification. It states that the constellation of Saptarshi (Ursa Major)
visits different lunar mansions, spending 100 years in each mansion and then
moving on. A particularly important event in the Indian epic Mahabharata discusses
this calendar apart from other literature. However, since none of the constellations
move in the sky, it is assumed to be more philosophical than real. However, Sule et
al. (2007) have shown that the original reference is more specific. It states that if you
take the vector joining the North Pole with the midpoint of the first two stars of Ursa
Major, that vector points to a specific lunar mansion. This is defined as the house of
Ursa Major and it is this vector that moves over a period of 100 years. Sule et al.
(2007) have simulated the movement of the vector and shown that around t 1200 BC



92
the vector did move from one lunar mansion to another. However, its subsequent
movements were slower and not monotonic. It therefore seems that for a short
period (about 150 years) of observations, this calendar must have appeared useful
even if it was discarded later as it was not accurate.
Indian astronomy of this period is fairly sophisticated with constellation
names, calculations of various kinds and study of precession of the Earth. David
Pingree has done an extensive survey of the Sanskrit literature of this period.
Unfortunately, the ancient literatures were written on perishable material and a lot of
it is lost. Only that material which was replicated in 16th to 18th century is available
now. Only a small fraction of this has been read since many are in private
collections. A large fraction of these are repetitive but there must be other
astronomical ideas in these that need to be studied (Subbarayappa, 2008: 7).
Pingree has also been critical of the source of astronomy insisting that it is not
indigenous but borrowed from the Babylonians (Pingree and Morrissey, 1989).
Subbarayappa (2008: 61-61) has put his criticism in perspective suggesting that
while he had pointed out several similarities he had himself cautioned against
deriving full conclusion from partially read texts. We have discussed this in detail in
Chapter 4.
5.3.3 Astronomy in Mahabharata
The great epic of Mahabharata has several interesting features. It is an epic of war
between brothers and as befitting an epic, it provides excellent details about the
astronomical knowledge of the period. Various claims have been made about the
astronomical references, some of which are either opinions or non-sustainable.
Mahabharata is also known to have had many subsequent additions making any
analysis of the astronomical references controversial (cf. Murthy, 2003). With this
rider, we discuss the work of Iyengar (2003) and other such studies as indicators of
astronomical references in Mahabharata. We have already discussed the work of
Sule et al. (2007) in section 5.3.3 suggesting that the Saptarshi calendar suggests
that Mahabharata can be dated to around 1400 BC. Iyengar (2003, 2005, 2006)
comes to the conclusion that the war in the epic occurred between 1493 and 1443
BC.



93
5.3.4 Cosmic Time Scales
In section 5.2.2 we discussed the concept of Yuga that was used to synchronise the
solar and lunar calendars. Over a period of time, astronomers began to realise that
the synchronisation was not perfect and longer time scales were envisioned. Kaye
(1998: 26 and 60) had listed the expanding time scales. We reproduce them below in
Table 5.3.
Table5.3: Duration of longest time interval envisaged.
Document Referred time period
Rig Veda 360 days of 12 months with a possible reference to 13th month as intercalary month.
Atharva Veda Thirteen months of 30 days.

5.3.5 Panchanga
Panchanga or Indian almanac is the backbone of Indian astronomy, astrology and
calendar and is commonly used today for calculations of auspicious time for
ceremonies etc. While each maker of the Panchanga keeps the method of
calculation a closely guarded secret they all claim to use Aryabhata’s work or
Suryasiddhanta or Karana method (Subbarayappa, 2008: 203 – 234; see also
Sewell and Dixit and Swell, 1995). By definition, Panchanga means 5 (pancha)
elements. These are the list of tithis (the lunar mansion of the Moon at any time or
lunar day), nakshtra (asterism), vara (solar day of the week), karana (a parameter
related to tithi) and yuga (related to the longitude of the Sun and the Moon). Its



94
earliest calculations are available in Vedanga Jyotisa (1200 BC) with later
refinements added over the next 2000 years and more. Since all the festivals in
Hinduism are based on lunar calendar or tithi (Subbarayappa, 2008: 260-278)
Panchanga plays a very important role in the daily lives of the Hindus even today.
Modern calculations use the Grahalaghavam of Ganesha Daivjna (Balachandra Rao
and Uma, 2006).
5.3.6 Cosmic and Human Infinities
One of the most fascinating aspects of Indian mathematics is the play with large
numbers and infinities. From the beginning, Indian philosophers have speculated on
infinities. The Idea of infinity seems to have so fascinated the philosophers from
early period that there are a variety of infinities found in the literature. There are at
least 12 different kinds of infinities:
1. Numbers: This idea arises in terms of the amount of wealth, which is
represented in terms of incomprehensible large number of cows etc.
2. Time: Time has a beginning when Brahman created the universe out of pure
thought. However, it then becomes periodic with Yuga’s and Maha-Yugas, which
are cyclic, but there is no end of time.
3. Time in infinity and interpolation: There is another set of ideas of relative time in
terms of human time, time looping as an illusion etc. However, even within this,
time loops do not violate causality. There is one particular story in Vishnu Purana
where the great god Vishnu is travelling with his friend Narada. At some stage
Vishnu sends Narada to fetch water for him. Narada goes to the well, falls in love
with a maiden who happens to be there at that time, marries her, has children
and lives through all the tabulations of life and at the end of a long life returns to
Vishnu who reprimands him for taking five minutes to fetch a bit of water.
4. Space: Space is defined to be infinite in early literature but that is without relation
to the cosmos. It is a flat long world and the cosmos is taken as another entity in
the early literature.
5. Cosmos: In later literature, the idea of infinity of space is extended to cosmos
and its layered structure.



95
6. Duration of ‘life’: This idea arises in the form of rebirth and related ideas and
eventually the goal of life is defined in terms of working to end this eternal cycle
of birth and death through living life according to Dharma.
7. Number of gods: There are infinite gods and whenever a specific god is
worshiped all important virtues and names are assigned to that god.
8. Meditation: Meditation is supposed to provide us internal knowledge of mind and
soul, which is essentially infinitely deep.
9. Ideas: With infinite number of gods, everything from atheism to agnosticism is a
part of religious thought.
10. Size scales: From infinity to infinitesimal, - from infinitely large to infinitely small.
11. Brahman: Brahman is essentially abstract and infinite – only he existed when
even time did not.
12. Knowledge: By definition of knowledge is infinite and unbounded.
In the Indian philosophy infinity is also called complete or the true whole
(Purna) and the ultimate purpose of life is to merge the completeness of one’s soul
with the completeness of the infinite god. It is a profound idea in that, finite is neither
complete, nor ideal nor Brahman. Only infinite can be complete. This is in contrast
to the Greeks who abhorred infinity and thought that the geometry of circle is perfect.
Yet the philosophy also accepts that all that is physical (including gods) have limited
time. Gods too are born (see for example the Nasadiya Sukta verse in Chapter 4).
They too have finite lives that are made infinite through various means. By
definitions, Brahman is truth and knowledge is infinite.
This play of infinity is not linear in the sense that it can loop within itself. The
relative movement of time and depth is a highly individual perception that runs
through all the philosophical discourses even today.
5.4 Modern Astronomy
Modern astronomy has an equal component of basic astronomy and a large number
of other fields, which are integrated into a broad field of study. The first field to be
integrated is mathematics where astronomers attempt to make accurate calculations
of planetary motion, movement of equinoxes etc. The next field to be integrated is
physics where real or imagined properties are attached to all beings, including the



96
ones in heavens and attempts are made to create a physical view of the universe.
There are some excellent reviews of astronomy (see e.g. Narlikar and Kochhar,
2009, Subbarayappa, 2008, Kochhar, 1999) and other sciences in this period. We
will discuss this in a broader perspective.
Once a civilisation grows beyond a certain level of sophistication, a culture
begins to specialise in tasks and not everyone will be required to be proficient in all
aspects of life. This translates into specialised education programme that come in a
variety of forms. However, a common feature of most of these is the state patronage.
Depending on the capability, development of astronomy is driven by mathematical
and technological developments. Interaction with neighbouring cultures can also
spur the growth. From here on, the growth of astronomy follows the same rate of
growth as the rest of the society.
In the Indian context, this phase begins around 500 AD with the advent of
Siddhantic (mathematical or computational) astronomy and great astronomers like
Aryabhata. It also has a strong influence of Greek astronomy. Pre-occupation of
Indian astronomers for the next millennium was calculation of geocentric planetary
orbits and development of algorithms for solving mathematical equations arising in
the process with instrumentation and observation playing a secondary role to
computations (Abraham et al., 2009, Kochhar and Narlikar, 1995).
With the advent of formal, large-scale education and specialised teachers the
requirements for a good astronomer become stringent. They are defined in Brihad
Samhita of Varahamihira (505 AD) and is given in Chapter 4 (Subbarayappa and
Sarma, 1985, p. 10).
This phase includes speculations on geocentric world with epicycles of
movement to account for retrograde motion of planets (Sen, 2009), empirical
calculations of eclipses, auspicious periods etc. These aspects of Indian astronomy
are very well documented in a large number of publications and we avoid repeating
them here. Interested readers are referred to Bose, Sen and Subbarayappa (2009),
Subbarayappa (2008), Subbarayappa and Sarma (1985), Sewell and Dikshit (1995)
on Indian Calendar and Balachandra Rao and Venugopal (2008, 2009) on classical
methods of calculating eclipses and transits.



97
One of the important aspects of this stage of astronomy is the interaction
between the Indian scientific traditions in general with the Arabic tradition. We refer
the interested readers to Subbarayappa (2008: 345-443), Narlikar and Kochhar
(2009) and Ifrah (1981).
5.4.1 Refinement of Old Ideas
There are many myths that evolve and the meanings assigned to them change with
time to incorporate new ideas. For example, in the early mythologies, the eclipses
are caused by the daemons Rahu and Ketu trying to eat up the Sun and the Moon
respectively (Kaye, 1998: 35-36). They are defined as one of the navagrahas (nine
planets) with negative connotation since they are dark. In Puranas the story evolves
along the line of a demon who manages to get the divine nectar during the
Samudramanthan. His head is then cut. The head and the body then go hunting for
the Sun and the Moon in the sky as Rahu and Ketu and cause eclipses. Once the
mathematics of the eclipses is known, Rahu and Ketu are defined as two points on
the Earth-Sun line. Rahu is referred to as the ascending node of the orbits of Sun
and Moon and Ketu is known as the descending node of the orbits of Sun and
Moon. They are called pseudo-planets and their equations of motion are calculated.
When Sun and Moon both approach them, an eclipse occurs and the equations are
solved to determine the times of eclipses in the period of Aryabhata and beyond
(Balachandra Rao and Venugopal, 2008).
5.4.2 Numbers
While discussing infinities, we noted that the Indians had a fascination for large
numbers and even the earliest verses in Rig Veda ask for blessings of countless
number of cows etc. The numbers were expressed in powers of ten (cf. Sen 2009).
In Taitreya Upanishad numbers as large as 1012 can be found.
Since most of the ancient literature was composed for oral transmission which
has to be error resistant, the rendering of numbers in the ancient Indian system is
very complex. Essentially the numbers were rendered with words and some specific
words were used to refer to numbers. The purpose of this was to keep the verses
internally rhyming to facilitate their oral transmission. This technique ensured that the
narration had a simple meter length for its rendition and also some ruggedness



98
against copying errors (Subbrayappa 2008: 10-13). Primary coding systems were
Bhuta Sankhya which used synonyms of sky for 0, Earth and Moon for 1, eyes for 2,
fire and worlds for 3, ocean for 4, arrow for 5, horse and mountain for 7, serpent for
8, Shiva (one of the ancient trinity of gods) for 11, Sun for 12, and gods for 33.
Aryabhata (500 AD) adopted a more complex method of expressing numbers with
consonants and vowels based on decimal place value system. The most common of
the number systems was the Katapayadi system. Under this scheme, each set of
consonants were assigned a specific number and large numbers were coded by
creating words using appropriate consonants and vowels (which had no numeric
value) to create a stanza that was easy to memorise and reasonably error free.
The numbers 12, 60 and 360 have astronomical significance. It starts with 12
months of a year and hence a movement of 1/12 of sky (by Sun) in 1 month. Sixty
Nadikas make a day and 12 civil days make a year. To avoid fractions the sky is
divided into 360 degrees (12 × 30) so that Sun moves 1 unit per day. That is how
circle gets divided into 360 degrees.
These numbers form the basic units of time and could be astronomical in
origin. Some of the ancient civilizations used 60 as their base for number system
(sexagesimal system), say for example Babylonian. The selection of 60 over other
numbers again (as generally believed) could have been to make the calculations etc.
easier, as 60 has about 10 integral factors, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30 i.e.
more factors than any other number of comparable size. Thus, we have the division
of hours into 60 minutes, minute into sixty seconds, circle into 360 degrees, each of
60 minutes (each minute of 60 arc seconds) and so on.
An excellent review of Indian number system and its role in the worldwide
evolution of mathematics is given by Ifrah (1981).
5.4.3 Time Units
During this phase the idea of time undergoes significant changes. We have already
given the philosophical ideas about time in section 2.1.1. The Vedas define 12
months of Luni – Solar calendar and the fact that there is a discrepancy of seasons
and the 12 Lunar months. They therefore propose the idea of intercalary months
(two every five years) to resynchronise the two. In Vedanga Jyotisa, that gives the



99
astronomical aspects of the Vedas, they define (see Subbarayappa and Sarma,
1985, footnote on p 51) 5 solar years as 1 Yuga, 366 day or 12 solar months as one
year, 30 mahuratas as 1 day (i.e. 1 mahurata is 48 minutes), 2 nadikas as 1
mahurata (i.e. 1 nadika is 24 minutes), 10 1/20 kala as 1 nadika (1 kala is therefore
2.4 minutes) , kala itself is divided so that 124 kasthas (about 1.1 sec) make a kala
and 5 gurvaksaras or 10 matras (0.1 sec) as 1 kasthas. However, while these
ultrafine steps of time are defined, there is no clarity on how to measure such fine
time steps or their utility. Most of the activities stop at a nadika that is 24 minutes,
though time up to kastha could be measured simply by heartbeat or even recitation
of verses of fixed length.
By the time of Vateswara (904 AD, see Subbarayappa and Sarma, 1985
footnote on p. 53 and p. 313 for period of Vateswara) the time division had the
following stretch: 100 years of Brahma is his life span. 1 year of Brahma is 725,760
human Yugas and 1 Yuga is 4,320,000 human years. On the lower side, we have
2.5 kasthas equal to 1 asu or 4 seconds (time taken to complete one breath). 1
kastha itself is the time taken to recite 4 long syllables, 1 nimesa is the time taken
for the eye to twinkle and 4.5 nimesa equals 1 long syllable or 1⁄4 of a kastha.
Nimesa itself is divided into 100 lavas and 1 lava is divided into 100 trutis and 1 truti
is defined as the lotus pricking time. While some ideas about the time units are
given, they seem to have been designed more for the pleasure of defining them
rather than using them for any purpose.
Vateswara (see Subbarayappa and Sarma, 1985, p. 53) clarifies that there
are nine time reckonings (Table 5.4).
Table 5.4: Time Reckoning.
Reckoning Unit Used Definition
Sidereal Sidereal day One star rise to the next.
Lunar Lunar month One new Moon to next.
Solar Solar year Period of one solar revolution.
Civil Civil day One sunrise to next.
Brahma Day of Brahma Period of 2 kalpas or 2016 Yugas.
Jovian Jovian year Period of Jupiter’s motion through a zodiacal sign.
Paternal (Manes) Day of Manes One lunar month.
Divine Day of gods One solar year.
Demoniacal Day of demons One solar year.



100
The concept of Yuga is also a complex one that has been significantly
modified over time. Indeed, the word Yuga itself has three different meanings
(Kochhar, 2007). In Vedic period, it is used for constructing cosmic chronology while
in mathematical astronomy it has been applied to calculate planetary periods.
Duration of Yuga varies from 5 years in the Vedic literature to several millions of
years in later literature.
5.4.4 Time Measurement
Time measurement is an important concept. However, in ancient Indian literature,
while time units of various kinds have been mentioned, their process of
measurement is not clear. It often includes human related units such as breathing in
or wink of an eye. Kave (1998: 67) has discussed various time measuring devices.
These include water clock (clepsydra) discussed in Vedanga Jyotisa with a time unit
of 24 minutes (1 nadika). A gnomon is a natural device for time measurement but its
extension into a formal Sun-dial is discussed only in the Panchasiddhantika dated to
after 500 AD. Other instruments such as astrolabe etc. come with Arab influence
much later. Surya Siddhanta also discusses armillary sphere.
5.4.5 The Drive of Technology
Another feature of this period is the build-up of large structures to study astronomy.
Large astronomical observatories which attempt to measure stellar parameters and
their variations appear. These allow astronomical measurements with great
accuracy. In India, these are called Jantar Mantars and one of their finest examples
is in Delhi (Figure 5.7). It was built between 1724 AD and 1727 AD and its primary
purpose was to measure stellar parameters. However, by this period, telescopes had
been invented and were in regular use. The period of telescopic astronomy is well
documented and we shall not discuss it here.
Figure 5.76: Jantar Mantar, New Delhi, an astronomical observatory.



101
5.4.6 Navigational Astronomy
One of the major uses of astronomy is in navigation. In the Indian context, astronomy
has been regularly used for navigation. Excellent details of use of astronomy from
14th century for maritime purpose are available (Arunachalam, 2002). In this
exhaustive study, he has discussed the astronomical tools and methods used by
Indian fishermen. The seafarers along the west coast of India typically made use of a
chart of the rising and setting point of various constellations drawn as per their
personal preferences (Figure 5.8).
To reach any port, they would follow rising or setting location of a particular
constellation for a certain period and then turn towards another constellation. In
order to determine that they were moving as per the needs, they used simple,
knotted floatation devices and other tools.
5.4.7 Ancient Records of Eclipses, Comets and Supernovae
The oldest mention of eclipse can be found in Rig Veda. However, serious attempts
to predict and systematically study eclipses begin only around the time of Aryabhata.
Subbarayappa and Vahia (2014) have catalogued 358 eclipses between 440 AD and
1900 AD from various ancient sources (Figure 5.9). Iyengar (2013) has listed large
number of references to planets, stars and comets occurring in various ancient
Sanskrit texts. Narlikar and Bhate (2001) have searched for references to Crab
Supernova in ancient Indian literature but have not been able to establish its
reference. Joglekar et al. (2007) have listed out possible eclipse records that should

102
be found in India and Joglekar et al. (2011) have suggested that the rock painting
shown in Figure 5.3 mentioned earlier could also represent an eclipse record.
Figure 5.98: Number of Eclipses reported in a fiveyear period from 440 AD to 1850 AD (Vahia et al. 2013).
Various predictive methods have been used to predict eclipses. In particular,
the concept of Rahu and Ketu is invoked. In original mythology, these are two
demons trying to eat up Sun and Moon. Aryabhata is the first one to explicitly state
that eclipses occur due to the shadow of the Earth or the Moon that falls on the other
object (Subbarayappa, 2008: 145). Since the time of Aryabhata (500 AD), Rahu
corresponds to the ascending node and Ketu the descending node of the ecliptic.
The calculations involve calculating the proximity of the Sun and Moons shadow to
this point and when the two merge, eclipse is expected. The size of the shadow is
calculated by triangulation using the angular sizes of various objects (see
Balachandra Rao and Venugopal, 2008 for details of the method).
5.4.8 Telescope Based Astronomy
With the advent of telescopes, photographic techniques, electronic detectors and
multi-wavelength astronomy, the subject of astronomy looks almost unrecognisable
from its roots. Today, India has the world’s largest meterwave radio telescope, the
Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, several satellite based experiments in optical as
well as in ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma-rays in addition to good ground based and
underground astronomical observatories. It also has several excellent theoretical



103
astrophysicists working in various institutions in India. A good summary of growth of
modern astronomy in India can be found in Narlikar and Kochhar (2009) and
Sreekantan (2009).
The emphasis of astronomical growth in India for the past 150 years has been
varied. The first astronomical observatory was set up in Chennai was initially set up
to aid in the survey of the subcontinent, map the sky in mid latitudes that are not
accessible from Europe. It was also used to monitor seasons, seasonal changes and
study eclipses. However, once established, the programme took a life of its own and
India now has more than 150 years of continuous observations of the Sun. Amongst
several studies, the Evershed effect was reported by John Evershed from
observations in Kodaikanal. Since then, India has gradually built up on its
astronomical observational and theoretical skills. It has an active space astronomy
programme and several high altitude optical telescopes and one lake-side solar
telescope. Together they provide an excellent set of facilities and a pool of
theoretical astrophysicists to pursue research.



104
6. Conclusion
The heavens have fascinated humans for a large variety of reasons. From the first
look at the sky with the fear of thunder and lightning, to the study of stars, galaxies
and other exotica at the farthest reaches of the observable universe, human journey
in astronomy has been a long and intricate one. Skies have pervaded all aspects of
human intellectual activity and no field of human expression has been devoid of
some influence of astronomy.
Our perspective of the sky has also not been static. Promoting it from sky to
the heavens – the abode of gods, astronomy has given a wide canvas for human
imagery and imagination. Early thinkers imagined the origin of the universe through
Hiranyagarbha (the golden egg) and others attributed the existence of the universe
to just a thought or ardour of one great being. Humans have somehow sensed that
the heavens are far bigger than they are – a realisation that seems to have preceded
all human written records. With the advent of settled life, the rhythmic nature of the
skies and their deep predictability covered by transitive unpredictability, they realised
the power of the heavens over their lives. Humans have been in awe of the crucial
role of rains in seeding the all-forgiving mother earth. They have loved and used the
skies in a manner that is unique. From earliest times, humans have created large
structures that were witnesses to the heavenly cycles, as if to mirror the power of the
heavens. Defining the vastness of heavens has been our “last frontier” well before it
became fashionable to call it so.
The idea of space and time have always intrigued humans from the earliest
times when they noticed long term cycles in the heavens that they assigned to forces
beyond their reach. Appalled by the idea of leaving the dead to the elements with all
the mutilations that would be inevitable, they soon began to give a resting place to
the dead. A desire to not let go of the dead, the myths about the presence of gods
(probably aided by appropriate hallucinations, prophecies and soothsaying), the
place of burial soon began to be treated as sacred. Attempts to remain in touch with
the dead by keeping track of their final resting place gave rise to the first sepulchral
megalithic stone structures.

As the regularity and predictability of the changes in environment and
heavens began to catch their notice, they soon realised its importance in their lives.
Hence, as human intelligence rose above the mundane use of space to a more
sophisticated understanding of space and time, they probably created around them
structures that tried to hold these together in the form of non-sepulchral megaliths
like the astronomically oriented avenues and alignments.
Compulsions of environment and the rising human intelligence along with the
technological skills allowed humans to create megaliths that are impressive for their
architectural subtleties. From menhirs to dolmens of different shapes and sizes one
can see their rising desire to keep track of the dead and connect these structures
with the cosmos.
We are sure that we have only touched rather limited perspectives of
astronomy in this little book but we hope that it will instigate our readers to think of
other perspectives and enjoy the journey of exploring those ideas. We have
deliberately explored less-travelled avenues of thought in the hope that some of the
readers may carry these ideas forward and confirm or negate them. Our efforts
would be worthwhile if at least some of the readers get inspired enough to take up an
active interest in this field.
Within this subject of astronomy lie a whole set of currents and undercurrents.
Each of these under currents carries their own story. These stories, are both
independent of and yet mutually dependent on each other. Investigating the origins
of astronomy therefore is a fascinating study not only of the universe but also of how
humans engaged with the universe throughout history. In this book we have explored
only a handful of these explorations.
The first exploration was an attempt to simply understand what it means to be
enlightened astronomically and how humans might have arrived at the doors of
astronomical knowledge. It has been a tough and demanding journey and
humankind has been at it for more than five thousand years and yet, after all these
years, each new insight produces more queries. The second exploration was an
effort to understand the interplay of astronomy with other human intellectual



106
traditions, from religion to art and architecture. The third was to study the human
desire to create extravagant and artificial but highly utilitarian landscape where
astronomy also seems to play a crucial role. The fourth exploration was to
understand the perspective of how captivating the heavens have been to humans
and how humans have perceived the drama in the heavens, relating it to the gods
and their influence on human life. The fifth exploration that we undertook was an
analytical study of changes in the human understanding of heavens and its relation
to the evolution of human life from hunter gatherers to city dwellers.
