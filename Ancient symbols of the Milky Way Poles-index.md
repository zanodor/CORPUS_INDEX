Ancient symbols of the Milky Way Poles.
MILKY WAY DIRECTIONS
The North Pole Centre
When our ancestors began to become settlers, they also began
to build their villages much likely to their knowledge and ideas of
the heavenly pictures and its cosmological meaning.
This copy sketched picture (1) from Denmark, northern Jutland,
location Udsholt, shows 2 significant features. First the (black
marked) group of cupmarks with a wheel showing the star
constellation of Ursa Minor or Little Bear, and the northern
circumpolar centre in the night sky as shown on the star map
picture beside to the right. Secondly the figure with the numbers
to the left. If you extend the lines out from the concentric rings,
you will get the 4 cardinal directions in our Galaxy compared to
the placement of the Sun System.
As it again is about to be a common knowledge, at least amongst
astroarchaeologists, our ancestors placed their holy places in
alignment with the Sun and the Moon. But it is not quite as well
recognized that our ancestors also build their holy places in
alignment with the cardinal directions of our Galaxy.



Possible Galactic Poles
The middle picture (2) is a printed section taken from a celestial
computer program. The green circle represent the Northern
Celestial Pole (NCP), and the red circle represent the Northern
Galactic Pole (NGP).
If you stitch picture 1 above and picture 2 together, you have got
a remarkable resemblance between ancient intuitive knowledge



and modern science! In my opinion our ancestors clearly have
sensed some cosmological facts which seemingly can be
confirmed by modern astronomical and cosmological science!
In the prolonged directions of the rounded "arms" in the red circle
cross, you have the star constellation of Sagittarius and the
centre of our Galaxy pointing at number 1. In line 2 you will se the
constellation of Pisces. Line 3 shows the direction towards the
star constellations of Gemini and the line 4 point towards the star
constellation of Virgo. The spot of the Northern Galactic Pole
(NGP) are placed approximately at "Berenices Hair Locks" or
"Charles's Heart".
The First Milky Way Direction
North
South
This situation is to be seen at midnight, January the 4 ́th, and our
ancestors had two significant stars, namely Vega in Lyra and
Sirius in The Big Dog, as their guiding stars to mark a celestial line
to this special holy celestial constellation time of the year.
Drawing a line from Sirius over the celestial pole location and
further on to Vega and extend the line, one will get the direction



to the galactic centre, from where all things in our galaxy is
created and therefore is an important part of the globally Stories
of Creation.
The southern hemisphere guideline.
Drawing a line from Sirius over Canopus and the south celestial
pole area and further on to the constellation of Sagittarius this
line show the mytho-cosmological direction to the Milky Way
center which is the very basics of the global Stories of Creation.
The 4 Milky Way Directions



Picture 1 above is from Denmark, locality Als. The cupmarks on
the middle stone is showing the star constellation of The Big Bear
or The Big Dipper, and underneath there is a 4 spoke wheel. If
you prolong the spoke lines, also on a star map, you will get the 4
cardinal directions in our Galaxy compared to the location of our
Solar System.
