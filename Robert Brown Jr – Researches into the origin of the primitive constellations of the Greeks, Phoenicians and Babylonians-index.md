INTRODUCTION
TO VOLUME II.
In the first volume of this work I have treated at
length of the ancient constellations as they appear in
Greek literature from the earliest times to the days of
Ptolemy, paying special attention to the Homeric references to stars and Signs. I have also noticed, in
very considerable detail, how the constellation-forms,
with hardly an exception, reappear as coin-types, and how nearly all the most prominent of the heavenly Signs are familiar subjects in the early unnumismatic
art of Asia Minor and of the Aigaion seabord. Lastly,
I considered Babylonian astronomy subsequently to the age of Alexander, and with particular reference to the question whether the Euphrateans had an
independent scientific astronomy of their own, or whether they were wholly indebted for this to Greek
intellect. I found reason unhesitatingly to believe
that throughout the earlier intercourse between Hellas
and the Euphrates Valley, the former was the bor
rower ; and that the main foundations of the science
were laid in the country of the Two Eivers at a
period when the Greek was an uncultured, although doubtless highly intelligent, barbarian. I also noticed
that many of the ancient Greek constellations were
actually identical with those of Babylonia, and had
been introduced into Hellas through the medium of
the Phoenicians, and of the mixed peoples of Asia



Xll INTRODUCTION.
Minor. Further, I adduced a variety of reasons in
support of the view that the constellations named in
early Greek writers, such as Homer and Hesiod, did
not represent the only Signs known to them at the
time ; and that others, equally familiar, were not
mentioned, simply because the subject did not require any reference to them. It remains for me, in the
present volume, to trace back, by illustrative in
stances, the employment of the constellation-figures in the Euphrates Valley to a very remote period, and
to explain, if possible, the mental process pursuant to which these familiar forms first came into existence.
The mass of early Euphratean literature upon
stellar subjects was, and even is, enormous. The
catalogued Tablets in the iT. collection of the British
Museum alone number 14,230, the far greater portion
of which are more or less astronomical. But the vast
majority of them are of little or no service in the
present enquiry, as they merely repeat familiar starnames in connexion with actual terrestrial occurrence,
on the cum hoc, ergo propter hoc principle, or else only record simple astronomical observations which
were continually being made, such as ' The moon
rose, and the star x in its place is fixed.' Here and
there, however, we come upon Tablets of the highest value, such as give lists of stars or constellations con
nected with different months, or with special portions
of the heaven, and we also meet with occasional very
useful explanatory glosses. Out of the mass of
cuneiform evidence available, I have specially selected
for translation and comment :
Tablets Sm. 162; 83-1-18, 608; and 81-7-27, 94, being three surviving fragments of the Sumero-Semitic Euphratean Plani
sphere. .



INTRODUCTION. Xlll
The ' Sign '-Tablet of the Months (Te Tablet), No. 85-4-80, 15
(Vide Vol. I. 9). The Tablet of the Thirty Stars (W. A. I. V. xlvi. No. 1), or Archaic Lunar Zodiac.
The Lists of the Tiksi-Tikpi, Lu-mdsi, and Mad stars (W. A. I.
II. xlix. 10-13; III. lvii. No. 6). The Tablet of the ' Proclaimers '
(Dilbat Tablet, 81-7-6, 102). The List of the 'Twelve Stars of the West' (W.A.I. II. xlix.
No. 1). The List of the Stars of the Fields of Ann, Bel and Ea (Tablet
82-5-22, 512). The Tablet W. A. I. III. lvii. No. 5 (Notices of Centaurus,
Sagittarius, etc.).
These I have supplemented by numerous extracts
from other Tablets, and have illustrated by several
maps and figures. The result enables us to compile a
very fairly complete list of Euphratean stars and con
stellations, although, as previously noticed, a great amount of cuneiform literature is still unpublished.
That much more will be accomplished in the future in
these studies I do not doubt ; but, meanwhile, I think
it will be admitted that considerable progress has
been made. The outcome of Euphratean astrological science may be thoroughly studied in M. Bouche
Leclercq's very learned and exhaustive work, L'Astro
logie Grecque, 1899. The Tablets above mentioned
cover altogether a period from about B.C. 500 to the
third millennium B.C., a fact which implies that the
mapping out of asterisms and constellation-figures had commenced long prior to the latter epoch.
In the first volume of this work I pleaded for
careful criticism, which, so far, I have generally received ; and I have to thank many kindly writers
for their notices, especially since the subject is intricate and off the beaten paths. In one or two in



XIV INTRODUCTION.
stances my critics have been hostile, but I regret
that I have not been able to profit much from their
strictures on account of the vagueness of the charges
brought against me. One writer, however, is rather more definite. Thus, he says (quoting no passage) that I '
really ought to know that there is no h either
in Assyrian or in Akkadian/ I happened to mention
this dictum to the first of living English Assyriologists, who at once replied that it was ' a heresy.' The same writer is both shocked and amused because (fol
lowing various high authorities) I write ' Samas ' and
not ' Shamash,' etc., a form with which, however, my
critic might have noticed that I must necessarily be
familiar, inasmuch as it occurs in various works which
I have quoted. But, according to some oj^ponents, if I don't use a form I must necessarily be ignorant of
it; just as if I refer to a book written twenty years
ago, it follows that I can have read no more recent
work on the subject. This sort of thing, however, is
not ' criticism,' but rather savours of malevolence, and betokens an inability to construe a written docu
ment. And I would ask my reviewer, ' Is it not a
fact that, in proper names, an As. s (Shin) frequently
=a Heb. 4 (Samech) V In a letter to the paper in
which these remarks appeared, I suggested that the
reviewer, in addition to such and several other equally
valuable strictures, should say something about the
constellations, as they formed the subject of the book.
But this he (no doubt judiciously) absolutely declined
to do, merely observing that he '
entirely dissented '
from my view of the matter. Let the real expert
smite me it shall be a kindness ; and let him
reprove me it shall be an excellent oil ; but from
the anonymous reviewer, who feigns to know so



INTRODUCTION. XV
much, and yet is found to be wanting, or to keep his
wisdom carefully to himself, I can derive no benefit.
Another reviewer really seemed to be very angry
because I write ' Darayavaush
' instead of Darius.'
He was specially aggrieved at the reason I gave, 1 inasmuch as that was his name,' and fiercely taunted
me with writing
' Alexander/ As I observed, ' Severe
logical uniformity in this matter is not at present
attainable.' Had I rashly written ' Alexandras/ my
critic might have suffered from a rush of blood to the
head.
With regard to the suggested derivations of various
proper names, my judges occasionally write that this or that is incorrect or ' absurd/ but specify no reasons
for their opinions. As far as I can gather, they appear to confuse two things which are entirely dis
tinct : namely (l) the established laws of letter
change in connected languages and dialects ; and (2)
the rough and ready way in which people endeavour
to express in speech or writing words and names quite unfamiliar to them. When we are dealing with
the attempts of Greeks, in the early historic period, to express Semitic words, or even non-Hellenic Aryan
words in a Greek form, there is no Grimm's Law to
guide us. When the Great King, Khshaydrshd, invaded Hellas, the Greeks, making the best they could of it, turned his name into Xerxes ; but how
impossible it would be, by any rules of Aryan letterchange, to recover the former from the latter. If* we
had no historical knowledge on the point, I can
imagine the scorn with which several modern critics
would treat the suggestion that these two names were
really identical. Or, again, when a Babylonian had to grapple with the difficulties of such a Greek name



XVI INTRODUCTION.
as StratonikS, how did he express it? He wrote Asta-ar-ta-ni-ik-ku=Astartanikku. Here, too, we hav<
no regular laws of letter-change which would lead to
this result. To take another instance. We know
that the name of the chief Assyrian god of later times
was Assur, and we read in the A.V. that Sennacherib
was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god. Can there be any connexion between the words Assur
and Nisroch ? Undoubtedly there is. As Mr. Pinches
has shown (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Soc, April,
1899, pp. 459-60), Assur=the Gk. forms 'E<ropaX and
Nao-a^oa^, which consist of Assur + the ending -ah,
1 which appears as -uk in the full form of the name of
Marduk, namely, Amuruduk.' Bearing such and many other similar instances in mind, it will be
observed that there is nothing impossible, or, in the
abstract, even improbable, in my suggestion, based on a variety of connected circumstances that such a name
as the Gk. Aleos (Vol. I. 232) represents an original
Sem. 'Elion, 'Eliun, which we find admittedly elsewhere in Hellas in the form of Elieus. Aleos may
possibly be a variant form of akeeivos ('hot'), and
Hesychios gives the equation a\e6s=$idTrvpo$ (' redhot ') ; and, if so, Aleos (' the Red-hot ') is a fitting
son of Apheidas (' the Unsparing '), son of Arkas, ' le
dieu-soleil,' as M. Berard justly calls him. But, be this as it may, the equation Elieus=Aleos may well stand. If a Greek met with such a form as 'Eliun
''EiXiovv (San. i. 5, 'Most-high'), he might very naturally regard it as an accusative of 'EXfeJ? (' Zeus at
Thebai,' Hesych.). Nor would there be anything to
prevent him from reading the name Alieus, Aleos, considering such a Phoenician form as Alonirn, 'dii
pr. Superi
' (=' the High-ones '). I trust, therefore,



INTRODUCTION. XV11
that the reader will not hastily accept the off-hand
dicta of irresponsible persons on such matters. A reviewer may frequently have a dozen or more works
before him, which he has to '
get through
' somehow
or other ; and he is aware that unless he poses as
having, years ago, gone all through the subject and come out at the other side, some people will probably
regard him as unequal to the emergency. Another circumstance which may frequently have
occurred in places where many languages met together, e.g., Krete, is the formation of words compounded of
more than one form of speech. Thus, I have sug
gested that the phrase 'the Lord T4n' (IIoWlTai/os)
became Hoo-eCSav, and that Amaltheia may = Sem.
Ammd + Gk. Oela (Vide Vol. I. 221). The ordinary
reviewer of a hostile type is invariably filled with
contemptuous horror at such ideas ; but neither he
nor anyone else has ever been able to explain these
names satisfactorily, or to urge any conclusive reason
why my suggestion is impossible. Innumerable instances occur in which two words have been firmly
welded together into a single name, e.g., Uru-Salim
(' The City of the god of Peace ')=Jerusalem. Here, as in the cases I mention, we have the combination
of a god-name and another word. If, then, in border
regions we meet with divinity-names which neither
Semitic nor Aryan languages can satisfactorily interpret, we might perhaps do worse than try the effect of a combination of the two.
The present study is practically a second part of my Semitic Influence in Hellenic Mythology. In that work I sketched in outline the principles and
standpoint of the Aryo-Semitic school of Hellenic
mythologists ; and combated, with his own weapons
b

of banter and pleasantry, what seemed to me some
absurdities of a certain brilliant writer on folklore,
totemism, and the savage. This afforded extreme
opponents an opportunity of asserting that my conduct was c unmannerly,' and also of somewhat meanly
pretending that my arguments were mere jokes which required no reply. I do not think, like those editors
who sent my book to Mr. Lang to review, that a man
is the best judge of his own cause ; but, as my stand
point has been approved of by such savants as Max
Miiller and Renouf, whilst my mode of treatment of
the subject has entertained men of letters of the grade
of Froude and Ruskin, I am quite content that one
or two 'Higher Critics' (Vide inf. p. 100), or some belated totemist of the school of Aguchekikos, should
pelt me with his roses. Let the galled jades wince.
1 may repeat that I have never attacked Totemism ;
but only the absurd effort to introduce it at any cost,
facts or no facts, into Hellas, Egypt, etc. Anyone who continues to hold that the Greeks
either received or invented the majority of the con
stellation-figures in comparatively late times, cannot fairly pass over the arguments and evidence to the
contrary which I have brought forward. The fact is,
as I have frequently been informed, very few scholars in recent times have closely studied the history of
the constellations, both externally, i.e., with respect
to literary references to them, and internally, i.e., with
respect to the adaptation of the forms to actual
stellar arrangement, and their alteration from time to
time. They have relied on opinions of the past,
founded upon insufficient evidence and examination,
and by no means up to date.
The question of the identification of stars, asterisms,



INTRODUCTION. XIX
and constellations, is, I am well aware, one of extreme
difficulty in numerous instances. I do not intend to
be dogmatic.
' The identification of the Chaldaean
constellations,' observes M. Maspero, ' with those of Graeco-Roman or modern times has not yet been
satisfactorily made out ' (Dawn, of Civ., p. 668, n.
3). Several English writers, e.g., Mr. L. W. King, in
his interesting Bab. Magic and Sorcery, refer to
Jensen as the principal authority on the question. But even with respect to the names of the planets,
Jensen has had at last reluctantly to agree that the
view of Oppert was, after all, the correct one (Vide
Ibid. p. 669, n. 6). The earlier investigators of the
subject were certain, from the nature of the case, to
make many and serious mistakes. Nor is this really
anything to their discredit, since nothing short of
inspiration could have avoided all error.
On this subject Dr. Morris Jastrow observes : 'While
it is probable that two or three of our constellations
are of occidental origin, the zodiacal system as a, whole
is the product of the Babylonian schools of astrology. From Babylonia the system made its way to the
west, and through western, more particularly through Greek, influence, back again to India and the distant
east. The number of constellations distinguished by
the Babylonian astronomers has not yet been definitely
ascertained. They certainly recognized more than twelve. Further investigations may show that they
knew most of the forty-eight constellations enumerated
by Ptolemy
'
{Religion of Babylonia and Assyria, 1898, p. 456). It will be observed that this cautious
conclusion of an eminent modern authority is, in all
respects, in perfect harmony with the views and sug
gestions set forth in the present work.



XX INTRODUCTION.
Lastly, I may observe that the subject of revealed
religion in general, and of Christianity in particular, does not come within the scope of these pages ; but,
remembering that some kindly religionists are always
ready to assume that a man who does not obtrude his
faith is destitute of any, and to draw divers charit
able conclusions accordingly ; and, moreover, not
being ashamed of any of my opinions, I would add, in the words of the illustrious savant to whose
memory I dedicate this volume, ' Je suis un chretien
. . . Ma foi est assez sol idem ent etablie pour ne pas
etre timide.'



PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS.
CHAPTEE IX.
The Constellations in the Babylonian Creation-Scheme.
The learned scribes of Assurbanipal, king of Assur
(Assyria), compiled, cir. B.C. 650, from far older sources that account of the beginning of things
which is now familiar to students of Assyriology
as the Creation Legend. The Fifth Tablet of this
composition states that some divine personage
1 prepared the mansions of the great gods ; He fixed the stars, even the Lumdsi, to correspond to them ;
He ordained the year, appointing the Signs of the Zodiac (Mizrdta yumazzir. Miz?rita=TLeb. Mazzdroth, Job xxxviii. 32) over it ; For each of the twelve months he fixed three stars '
(Ap. Sayce).
Prof. Sayce renders Lumdsi, ' the twin stars '
(Eel. Anct. Babs. p. 389), and there are two (Ak.) words
mas, one meaning ' twin,' the other ' hero.' As Mr.
Sayce notices (lb. p. 49), the earlier meaning of the
term, and the one which I prefer to adopt here, is
' the Sheep of the Hero,' the Ak. lu meaning '
sheep,'
' flocks.' * Mdsu, the " hero " of the astronomers,
could only have been the sun '
(lb.). Hence we see
that * the stars ' are further described as ' the Sheep
of the Hero' (Vide Vol. I. p. 287); and, as noticed VOL. II. 1



2 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [iX
(Sup. I. 16-17), the term JcaJckab (' star '), Ak. mul,
means either ' star ' or ' constellation/ according to
the context. The divine Arranger, therefore, fixed
3
' stars ' or ' constellations ' for each of the twelve
months. Which of these terms is intended ? Now,
as the 12 zodiacal constellations are named, if we
read ' stars ' we must understand the scribe as saying
either that (1) the * 3 stars ' are 3 stars in each
zodiacal constellation, or (2) that the 3 stars are 1 N.
of the Zodiac, 1 S., and 1 zodiacal. The first alter
native is vastly improbable, and, moreover, would show an incomplete scheme of the heavens ; whilst
the second would show an inconsistent scheme ; for
why should we have zodiacal constellations and no
others, and merely a mention of separate stars except
in the ecliptic ? The forming of star groups is a natural process by no means coufined to the limits of
the ecliptic. On a careful consideration of the pas
sage, therefore, we arrive at the conclusion that the
scribe refers to a scheme of 36 constellations, each
with its leading star, 12 northern, 12 southern, and
12 zodiacal.
This view of the scheme of the heavens, according
to the Creation Tablet, is abundantly confirmed when
we turn to the general evidence available. Thus, the
historian Diodoros (ii. 30-31), in a passage familiar to
Assyriologists, gives a resume of Chaldaean astro
nomico-astrology as it existed in his day ; and, however fantastical may be his account of the early history
of Babylonia, it is very clear that this statement,
probably mainly derived from Berosos, is perfectly accurate. The five planets, he says, were called
*

('Ejo^w-f?, Sum. Kinmi) ; and under,
i.e., in subjection to, these, were marshalled '

j
Stars,' which were styled
' Divinities of the Council '
(/3ov\alov$ Oeous).
' And they say that the Chiefs of
the Divinities '
[I.e., of the ' Counsellors '
previously mentioned.] are 12 in number, to each of whom they assign a month and one of the 12 Signs of the
Zodiac' Through these 12 Signs sud, moon and
planets run their courses. ' And with the zodiacal
Circle they mark out 24 Stars, half of which they say
are arranged in the north, and half in the south.' In
this celestial scheme, therefore, there were 12 pro
tagonistic, central and zodiacal stars, each connected
with a Sign of the Zodiac and constituting, so to
speak, its capital. The existence of such a head-star,
however, did not negative, but rather implied, the existence of the constellation of which it was the
head, just as Yorkshire is the natural complement of
York. These 12 zodiacal stars were flanked on either
side by 12 non-zodiacal stars, thus making up 3 sets
of 12, or 36 stars in all. And this number was not
arbitrary, for the 12 northern and the 12 southern
stars were reduplications of the 12 central and
zodiacal stars ; and the number of these, again, was
not arbitrary, but depended upon the cycles of the
moon during the year. In the same way, therefore, that the 12 central stars were respectively the heads
of the 12 zodiacal constellations, so were the other 24 stars the heads of the northern and southern constel
lations respectively. Whatever may have been the
practice of the ancient Arabians in the matter, it is
perfectly clear that the early Euphrateans grouped stars in constellations, e.g., the instances of the Wain
(Sup. Vol. I. 266) and the Archer (lb. 78). The
northern and southern constellations were the para
natellons of the zodiacal Signs.



4 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [iX
The (
Thirty Stars,' the ' Divinities of the Council/ are those referred to in W. A. I. V. xlvi. No. 1 (Inf.
Chap. XL). These, as I have shown elsewhere (30 S.;
E.S.R. Pt. v.), constituted the original Euphratean Lunar Zodiac, the parent of the seven ancient lunar
zodiacs which have come down to us, namely, the
Persian, Sogdian, Khorasmian, Chinese, Indian, Arab and Coptic schemes. The Ak. phrase,
' The Watch of
the Thirty
'
(Stars) is rendered in Sem. Bab. by
the Matstsardti (' The Signs of the Zodiac.' Vide
W. A. I. IV. xv. Col. i. 4), inasmuch as the fields of
the 30 Stars and the 12 Signs are practically identical. As Sumero-Akkadian had ceased to be a spoken
language for many hundred years prior to the time of
Assurbanipal, and as the great mass of archaic stellar
lore had been borrowed by the Semites from their
Turanian neighbours, it follows that the Euphratean
celestial Sphere, the latest edition of which we find
in such compositions as the Creation Legend above
quoted, is the venerable mother of all planispheres,
star-maps and astrolabes belonging to Western Asia
or to Europe. Three Fragments of this Sphere have been discovered, and are now in the British Museum ;
and a careful examination of these will further confirm
the results arrived at from a consideration of the
passage in the Creation Legend, as illustrated by the
account of Diodoros. The first Fragment, Sm. 162,
is thus described by Dr. Bezold (Cat. Cuneiform

rally enough at that period he only understood it
imperfectly, thinking, e.g., that some of the numbers
were ' errors in the Assyrian copy,' whereas, as we
shall see, they are all quite correct, a circumstance
which warns us that one of the last hypotheses in
interpretation should be that the record before us is
erroneous. Smith further thought that two stars in
Scorpio and two in Sagittarius were named, which is not the case. The Fragment was subsequently dis
cussed with great ability by Messrs. Bosanquet and Sayce (Monthly Notices of the Royal Astron. Soc.
Vol. XL. No. 3, Jan. 1880), in connexion with the
question of the division of the circle. They translate
it:
Month Marchesvan Month Cislev Star Lighat Star Nibatanu
140 degrees 120 degrees Star Girtab Star Utucagaba
70 degrees 60 degrees
'
They do not touch upon the general question of the reconstruction of the Euphratean Planisphere. I
read the Fragment in Sum.-Ak. as follows :
[Liu] Apin-dH-a Idu Gan-gan[-na] Mul Ligbat Mul Kisal-bat-a-la
lJfi 120 Mul Gir-tab Mul Ud-gu-du[-a] 70 60
In Bab. -As. it reads :
[Arkhu] Arakh-samna Arkhu Kislimu Kakkab Kalab-mituti Kakkab Kisallu-labiru-a-nu
ljfi 120
Kakkab Aqrabu Kakkab Yumu-nahri 70 60



6 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [iX
The translation of the Ak. version is :
' [Month] Opposite-to-the-Foun- Month The Very-cloudy. dation. Constellation The Ancient
Constellation The Beast-of-death, altar-below, 140. 120.
Constellation The Scorjrion, Constellation The Smiting
70. sun-face, 60.'
The translation of the Sem. version is similar, ex
cept that the months are the 'Eighth-month' (=OctNov.) and Kislev (=Nov.-Dec). The word ala is
rendered by a usual reading of the characters, anu, which makes the epithet difficult to understand ;
and the name of the fourth constellation is trans
lated by a paraphrase meaning ' the Day-of-dawn,' which probably=' the Dawn-of-day.' It will thus be observed that the Fragment relates to the
8th and 9th Signs of the Zodiac and months of
the year, and to constellations situate in that region
of the heavens. The 8th month being called (Ak.)
'
Foundation(^4pm)-in-front
'
[duo), it follows that
the foundation or commencement of the Calendar
when the Sum.-Ak. month-names were bestowed,
was the month opposite to it, namely, that which is now the second, and which was called (Ak.) Gutsisa
(' the-Directing-bull '), the Sem. Airu-Iyyar. Our
Planisphere thus takes us back by implication to a period prior to B.C. 2540, and when the sun was in
Taurus at the vernal equinox. In agreement with
this, Prof. Sayce observes, * In Accadian times the
commencement of the year was determined by the
position of the star Capella [a Aurigae], called
Dilgan, "the Messenger of Light
" [and also Askar, 'the Goat,'=Aix, vide Vol. I. 130], in relation to



IX ] BABYLONIAN CREATION- SCHEME. 7
the new moon at the vernal equinox
'
(Herodotos, p. 402). The constellations Girtab, ' The Scorpion
'
(Vide Vol. I. 71 et seq.), Ligbat ('The Wild-beast, vide Vol. I. 110 et seq.) and Udgudtta ('The Archer'
vide Vol. I. 77 et seq.) have been already referred to.
The fourth constellation, Kisal-bat-ala, called by the other translators Nibatanu, remains for consideration.
Now Nibatanu, or rather Zalbat-anu (Vide Vol. I.
347-8) is a name of Mars ; and it is clear, alike from
the account of Diodoros and from the general circum
stances of the case, that no planet could form one of
the 36 special stars connected with particular months, inasmuch as no planet is specially connected with any
particular month in at all the same way as are fixed
stars. According to the Fragment before us, we have
the stars or constellations of the Scorpion, the Wild
beast and the Archer as appearing in this portion of
the heavens, and these three forms are familiar to us
in Euphratean constellational art. Hence the infer
ence is irresistible that the fourth star or constellation
in question must be some familiar adjoining figure south of the zodiacal cincture.
No other figure except the Altar is available, and we therefore have to examine the Ak. name in this
connexion. Nor is there any difficulty in the inter
pretation proposed, for, amongst the various meanings
of the first sign is Kisallu (' altar.' Vide Sayce,
Syl. No. 139), a word derived from the Ak. Kisal
('altar'), which is compounded of hi (' place') -\-sal
(' oil ' or '
anointing ').
' The altar, so often depicted
on Assyrian gems and bas-reliefs, consisted of an
upright post or column, sometimes with an ex
tinguisher-like top. . . . These columns corresponded
to the " sun-pillars
" and asherim, or symbols of the



8 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [iX
goddess Asherah, so frequently alluded to in the Old Testament' (Sayce, Eel. Anct. Babs. pp. 410-11). The Ak. bat means '
old,' As. labiru, and we therefore obtain Kisal-bat (' the Old-altar ') as the name of
the fourth constellation of the Fragment. Although
nu is the ordinary reading of the last sign in the
name, yet it may also be read la (Vide Briinnow, Class. List, p. 100). The Ak. ala will be connected
with the Turko-Tatar root al, il (' below,' ' under,'
' what is beneath '), whence comes the Uigur all
('under'), and similar forms. This root al explains
the following well-known Ak. words : alal (=al + al,
i.e., al intensified), abraded to ala (a 'demon'), i.e.,
a creature which belongs to and comes up from the
Under- world ; alad (=ala + da, the 'individualising
affix'), a 'colossus'; Alala ('the Sun-god'), i.e., the
great
'
spirit
' who daily rises from and descends into
the Under- world. We therefore find that the full
name of this constellation is the Ancient-altar-below.
A passage from Aratos will assist us in appreciating
the significance of this appellation :
' Now 'neath the glowing sting of that huge Sign The Scorpion, near the south, the Altar hangs. And this you note but little time aloft ; For opposite Bear-watcher doth it rise.
And, whilst his course is wholly high in air,
It quickly speeds beneath the western sea '
(H. D. 402-7).
Proctor refers to ' the statement of Aratus, quoted
from the old astronomers (for every page of the
Phaenomena shows that Aratus was not himself an
observer of the heavens), that Ara is to be seen above
the horizon for as many hours as Arcturus remains
below the horizon. This relation has not been ful
filled since some 3800 years ago, when the star



IX] BABYLONIAN CREATION-SCHEME. 9
Arcturuswas 50 from the North Pole and the middle
of Ara 50 from the South Pole. If, as is probable,
the whole of Ara is meant, then the epoch must be
placed four centuries farther back.' These passages
illustrate the position of Ara as the Ancient-altar
beloiv, and confirm what I have shown elsewhere
(Vide R. B. Jr., H. I). ; C. E. A.), namely, that the
general celestial description contained in the Phaino
mena is Euphratean in origin. A careful examination
of Tab. Sm. 162 thus leads to the highly interesting
conclusion that the ancient Euphratean constellations
in this part of the Sphere were those of our modern
star-maps. Another fact disclosed by this Tablet is that the
zodiacal circle was divided into 120; for the Scorpion
being marked 70 and the Archer 60, the Bull, the
commencement of the circle, will be 10, and the Tivins,
its termination, 120. Similarly, the outer or southern
circle had double the number of degrees ; the Wild
beast being marked 140 and the Altar 120, the
constellation below the Bull would be 20 and that
below the Twins 240. It is further obvious from
the foregoiDg considerations that the Euphratean
Sphere must have contained a third, inner, or northern
circle, consisting of 60, viz., of half the number of
degrees of the central or zodiacal circle. We thus
meet again (Vide Vol. I. 332) with the all-important number 60, and with the zodiacal circle of 120.
The second of the three Fragments of the Euphra
tean Planisphere (No. 83-1-18, 608) is thus described
by Dr. Bezold (Cat. p. 1904) :
' Portion of a sphere or astrolabe, 2| in. by 1^\ in.;
- in. high. The flat side appears to have been in
scribed with the names and figures of certain stars.
'



IO PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [iX
The two star-names to the left are perhaps too
much mutilated for restoration ; but, fortunately, the
two other star-names are certain. In the inner or
northern division we read (Ak.) Mul Lugal, (Bab. -As.)
Kakkab Sarru (' The Constellation of the King '), and
below, '35.' The outer or zodiacal division contains
Mul Gir[_-tab\
' The Constellation of the Scorpion,'
and below, ' 70.' Each zodiacal division of the Plani
sphere evidently contained the figure 0, which, I
presume, as alike in the Egyptian hieroglyphs and in our modern almanacs, is the symbol of the sun, in
this case connected with each zodiacal sign and its
particular stars. The circle in the northern divisions,
if it was originally in each, probably indicated the chief star of each.
The constellation of the King represents the solar
hero and sun -god Gilgames sarru gitmalu dainu
Annunnaki} '
Gilgames, giant king, judge of the Masters-of-the-Under- world.' As Mr. Pinches has
pointed out to me, Maruduku (Merodach) is also
styled
'
King-of-the-gods
'
; and he and Gilgames are
really identical, as two variant solar phases. But this constellation is par excellence Gilgames, whose
favourite attitude on the monuments is kneeling upon
one knee,=Engonasin, the Phoenician Harekhal ('the
Traveller '),=Gk. Herakles, and the Phoenician Mel
qarth (' King-of-the-City '),=Gk. Melikertes. The huge stature of Herakles constantly appears in art, witness
that most comic of vase - representations, Herakles
slaying Busiris and his attendants. Agreeably with
this identification we find that amongst the names of
1 From a Tablet given in Haupt's Nimrod Epos, and translated by Mr. W. St. Chad Boscawen, in the Bab. and Oriental Record,
February, 1894.



BABYLONIAN CREATION-SCHEME. II
the constellation HerahUs-Engonasin, which is just
over the Scorpion, are Melicartus (=Melikertes) , Malica (=Ph. Melekh, ' the King,'=Bab. Sarru,=
Ak. Lugal), Palaemon (=Paiaimon,==Baal-Hamon,= Melqarth), and Maceris (=Makar,=Melqarth). 1
As these two Fragments of the Planisphere each give the Scorpion, one with its northern, the other
with its southern, paranatellon, we fortunately possess a complete segment of the circle, one-twelfth of the
whole (Vide Frontispiece). Apparently the diameter of the whole Planisphere was 7 inches or thereabouts, and the circumference 21 inches.
The Third of the three Fragments of the Plani
sphere (No. 81-7-27, 94) is thus described by Dr.
Bezold (Cat. p. 1803): ' Portion of the section of a sphere or astrolabe,
3 in. by 2^ in.; 1 in. high. The flat side appears to
have been inscribed with the names of the months,
and names and figures of certain stars.' In Akkadian
it reads :
Idu As-a-an [Idu] Se-ki\-sil\ Mul Sila-da-klia-bi Mul (lacuna) 80
In Bab. -As. it reads :
Arhliu Sabddhu [Arkhu] Addaru Kakkab Nun-suki Kahlcab (lacuna) 80
The translation of the Ak. version is :
'Month The Curse-of-rain. [Month] The Sowing-qf-seed. Constellation The Fish-of-the- Constellation {lacuna).'' Canal.
The months are the xith, Sehat (Jan. -Feb.), and
1 Vide Dupuis, Origine de Tons les Cultes, iii. 125.



12 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [iX
the xiith, Adar (Feb. -March) ; and the Fragment belongs to the southern or outer circle of the Plani
sphere, which had the month-names marked on it.
Eighty is the proper number of degrees for the xith
month in this circle. The month-name Curse-of-rain
alludes to the fact that ' Babylonia is reduced to an
impassable marsh by the rains of January
'
(Prof. Sayce, in Trans. S. B. A. iii. 164). The xith month
is that of Aquarius, and the Story of the Flood was
the legend specially connected with it. The Ak. con
stellation-name preserved on this Fragment supplies an interesting illustration of the Sum.-Ak. language.
Sila ('canal') -{-da (individualising affix) 4- kha ('fish')
+ hi (enclitic demonstrative)=' Canal-that-the-Fishof.' The readings kha and hi (Vide Briinnow, Class.
List, pp. 353, 6) are both sufficiently common, and in this case are obvious, inasmuch as the only constella
tion below Aquarius is the Southern Fish, into whose
mouth the stream (=' the Canal ') from the Urn
enters at the bright star Fornalhaut (=Ar. Famm
al-Hut, 'the Mouth-of-the-Fish '). Thus, a careful
examination of these three Fragments discloses a
perfect harmony and single scheme between them in
relation to each other ; and also an exact agreement
between them and the scheme of constellations which
are now in use.
The Sea-goat, the Dolphin, the Water-pourer, the Southern Fish, the Sea-monster, the zodiacal Fishes,
the Sea-horse (Pegasos, the demi-horse, just rising from the '
springs
' of Ocean), all belong to that watery part of the celestial sphere which was called ' the
Eegion of a' (Vide Vol. I. 84), who reappears westward first as Dagon and ultimately as Poseidon (Vide
K. B. Jr., P.; 0. N. C. p. 209 ; Sem. 192 ; Vol. I. 357),



BABYLONIAN CREATION-SCHEME.
lord of the Horse, the Dolphin, the Fishes, and the Monsters of the deep.
The Euphratean Planisphere, then, represents the result of a very important part of the idea of the
Babylonian Creation-scheme ; and we observe that
round the outer margin of the Planisphere were marked the names of the months. These, which are
well known from other sources, are as follows :
1. Ak. Bara-Ziggar ('the Upright Altar'), Sem. Nisannu.
March-April. 2. Ak. Gut-sidi (' the Directing Bull '), Sem. Airu (Iyyar). AprilMay. Otherwise Gut-sisa.
3. Ak. Mun-ga (' the Making of Bricks '), Sem. Sivdnu. MayJune.
4. Ak. Su-kulna ('the Seizer-of-seed '), Sem. Dtizu (Tammuz).
June-July. 5. Ak. Ne-ne-gar (Tire- making- fire'), Sem. Abu. July-August. 6. Ak. Ki-Ginglr-na ('the Errand of Istar'), Sem. Ululu (Elul).
August-September. 7. Ak. Tul-ku (' the Holy Altar '), Sem. Tisrttu (Tisri). September-October.
8. Ak. Apin-tMa ('Opposite to the Foundation'), Sem. Arakhsamna (Marchesvan). October-November.
9. Ak. Gan-ganna (
' the Very - cloudy '), Sem. Kislimu (Kislev). November-December. 10. Abba-e ('the Cave of the Rising'), Sem. Dhabitu (Tebet).
December-January. 1 1 . As-a-a?i (
' the Curse of Rain '), Sem. Sabddhu (Sebat).
January-February . 12. Se-lrisil ('the Sowing of Seed'), Sem. Addaru. FebruaryMarch.
Proceeding in the reconstruction of the Plani
sphere, we will next consider the Signs of the Zodiac.
The Brit. Mus. Tablet No. 85-4-30, 15 written in
the Bab. cuneiform gives the 12 months and a lead
ing star or constellation connected with each. Mr.
Pinches dates it 'about 500 B.C.,' and observes that



14 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [iX
of course it may be a copy of an earlier tablet.
This I do not doubt, as it is quite certain that no one
in the reign of Darayavaush I. invented a scheme of
constellations. The Tablet is thus unaffected by
Greek influence ; and we therefore observe that the
division of the ecliptic into 12 zodiacal parts was a
genuine Euphratean product. I call this the Te Tablet, because in each case, instead of KakJcab
('star,' 'constellation'), the form tc ('sign,' lit.
' foundation-stone,' vide Vol. I. 57),
'
principal point,' i.e., chief star or Sign, is used. The Tablet reads as
follows :
Month. Star or Constellation. Meaning of name.
1. Nisannu. Agaru. l The Messenger ' (= Aries).
The Leader of the Signs is the '
messenger
' of the
new year (Vide Vol. I. 54 ; as to the meaning of
Agaru or Aggaru, vide Briinnow, Class. List, p.
432 ; Muss-Arnolt, As. Diet. p. 15).
2. Airu. Temennu and ' The Foundation ' (=the
Alap-same. Pleiad) and ' the Bullof-heaven' {Taurus).
In Tablets Sp. 128 and 129, dated respectively 111
and 123 B.C., the form Te-te occurs in connexion with
this month and Sign. As I conjectured some years
ago, and as now actually appears from this Tablet, ' the doubled form shows that two constellations,
originally distinct, are included in the Bull.'
3. Sivdnu. Ri'u-but-same and ' The Shepherd-spirit-ofTudme rabuti. heaven ' and ' The Great Twins' {Castor
and Pollux).

IX] BABYLONIAN CREATION-SCHEME. 1 5
4. Duzu. Namgaru. 'The Crab.'
This constellation, the ordinary Ak. name of which is
Allah or AIM (Vide Vol. I. 360), is also called
Nagar-asarra (' the Workman-of-the-River-bed,' lb.
60). The '
sun-place,' of which it is called a voice
(lb. 360),=the ecliptic, and the expression
* Voice '
frequently occurs in Ak. star-names, the stars being the ' voices '
(proclaimers) of the heaven.
5. Abu. Aril rabu. ' The Great Lion.'
6. Ululu. Sim. 'The Ear-of-corn ' (=^Va).
7. Tisritu. Zibd {lacuna).
' The Claws.'

8. Arakh-samna (' The
Eighth-month '). Aarabu. * The Scorpion.'
9. Kislimu. (Ak.) Papilsak. ' Winged-fire-head ' (= Sagittarius. Vide Vol. I. 78).
It is probable that the Bab.-As. name of the constella
tion was Qastu (' the Bow '), Ph. and Heb. Qesheth,
Ar. Qaus, whence the names Alkus, MJeusu, and Kaus for the Archer,
10. DhaUtu. E7izu. < The Goat.'
11. Sabddhu. Kd. ' The Urn.'
From Kd are formed the Ph. and Heb. Ka-d, whence
the Gk. kJlSos (Vide Vol. I. 84).
12. Addaru. Riksu. 'The Cord.'
This star-name is much defaced, but it seems to read
(Ak.) Dur-hi (' Cord-place '), in allusion to the Cord
which fastens the two Fishes together (Vide Vol. I. 87).
The above is the Sem. rendering of the Tablet, as
in B.C. 500 Ak. had ceased for many centuries to
be a spoken language ; but the reader will observe
that these constellation-names are merely Sem.



1 6 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [iX
renderings of the ancient Ak. names, which read
syllabically as follows 1
:
1. Ku-e,=Sem. Agaru, and Kusariqqu ('Ram,' primarily anystrong horned animal), whence the late astronomical abbre
viation Ku.
2. Dimmenna, abbreviated to Te, and Gut-anna ('Bull-ofheaven ').
3. Sibzianna, and Mastalla-galgal (' the Great-twins '). Astronomical abbreviation Mas.

; Koibal-Karagass, Alep (' Hero '), Altaic
ulu-la, etc.
5. Lik- or Ur-gula ('the Great-dog,' i.e., the Lion). 6. Ab-nam (' The Proclaimer-of-rain ').
7. Ziba[-anna]. This name probably means ' Life-maker-of
heaven,' and would be applied to the ' Holy [solar] Altar,'
the Kakkab Nidub (' Lofty-altar,' the original sign of the
month (Vide Vol. I. 68-70). 8. Girtab (' the Scorpion '). Also called Gir-anna (' Scorpion-ofheaven ').
9. Papilsak (Vide Vol. I. 78-9). 10. Muna-kha (' The Goat-fish '). 11. Gula (' The Urn.' Vide Vol. I. 85). Also called Gusisa (' The
Directing-urn.' Vide inf. p. 67). 12. Durki (' The Cord-place ').
We have now reconstructed the Planisphere to the
extent of the month-names, the names of the Signs of the Zodiac, and the four constellations Hercules,
Lupus, Am, and Piscis Australis. We thus obtain
an assurance that the principal constellation-figures of the Euphratean celestial sphere were mainly those
of our own. I say
'
mainly,' for, as already shown, the
constellation-names Draco, Ursa Maj., Ursa Min.,
Cepheus, Cassiepeia, Andromeda, and Perseus originated on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean
(Vide Vol. i. in voc). To complete the formal scheme
1 On these names generally, vide Vol. I. Cap. iii.



IX] BABYLONIAN CREATION-SCHEME. 1 7
of the Planisphere we still require 11 Northern and
9 Southern Stars or Signs. Although the stellar host
is not ranged in regular rows of threes, either of stars
or of constellations, we shall have not much difficulty
in supplying the majority of these remaining constellation-names from the materials which have been
already noticed (Vide Vol. I. Chaps. III., VI.). In treating of the constellations of the Hipparcho
Ptolemy Star-list and of the Homeric Poems the
following (Ak.) Euphratean Signs were referred to:
Margidda (' the Long-chariot '), the Wain.
Sibzianna (' Shepherd-spirit-of-heaven'),=the Ploughman, and at times the star Bear-watcher.
Raditartakliu ('the Lammergeier '),=the Lyre (=Vultur). IdJehu (' the Eagle '),=the Eagle. Gar (' the Chariot '),=the Charioteer.
Sibzianna (the Southern Shepherd), =Ningirsu-Duzi (Tammuz)= Orion.
Lik (' the Dog,' Sem. Kalbn), = Canis Maj.
Pallika, other wise Palura ('the Crossing-of-the-Water-dog
,
), = 6fam'8 Min.
Tsir ('the Snake '), Caput Hydrae, or, more specially Alphard
(a Hydrae). Iyndugudkhu (' the-Great-storm-bird '),=the Crow. Gudelim (' the Horned-bull 5 ).=the Centaur.
To these we now add :
Lugal (' the King '),= Hercules. Ligbat (' the Beast-of-death '),=the Wolf. Kisalbatala (' the Ancient-altar-below '),=the Altar.
Siladakhabi (' the Fish-of-the-canal'),=the Southern Fish.
The following names, almost certainly constellational, were also mentioned :
Maganda-anna ('The Ship-of-the-canal-of-heaven '),= (probably) Navis Argo. Lut Tsirna (' The Bowl-of-the-Snake '),=the Boivl.
Kumar (' the Dusky '),=the Sea-monster.. VOL. II. 2



1 8 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [iX
If we were arranging a scheme of 36 constellations
in three rows of 12, we should probably dispose the
northern paranatellons of the zodiacal Signs as
follows :
Ram Cassiepeia. Bull Charioteer (=Ak. Gar. Vide Vol. I. 338 ; Ak. Sugi. Vide
inf. p. 114).
Twins Cepheus. Grab Lesser Bear.
Lion Bear (=Ak. Margidda). Virgin Ploughman (=Ak. Sibzianna). Claws Snake-holder, including the Snake.
Scorpion Hercules (=Ak. Lugal). Archer Lyre (=Ak. Raditartalihu). Goat Eagle (=Ak. Idkhu). Waterpourer Horse. Fishes A ndromeda.
In such an arrangement there would not be in
cluded Perseus, the Bird, and the smaller constella
tions the Arrow, Dolphin, Crown, and Triangle.
We, therefore, still require Euphratean paranatellons
representing Cassiepeia, Cepheus, Andromeda, the Lesser Bear, Snake-holder, and Horse ; and, as of course, the star- groups which form these three
human figures may have formed human figures in
the Euphratean Planisphere. In the present limited
state of our knowledge on the subject, many things
are very obscure or perplexing which a single tablet,
or even line, might make perfectly clear ; but, at the same time, we must do our best with existing
materials. To begin with Cassiepeia. This star
group lends itself naturally to the formation of
a distinct constellation, and most of those who know
anything about stellar matters can, on a clear night,
point out the W formed by its principal stars. In



IX] BABYLONIAN CREATION-SCHEME. 1 9
W. A. I. III. lxix. No. 5, the second column of
which, except the word '
Ditto,' has been broken off,
we have a list of god-names primarily solar. Now,
as I have frequently shown elsewhere, the great
majority of the constellation-figures are reduplications of simpler phenomena, a large number of them being solar in origin. 1 And we must also bear in
mind that in Euphratean mythology we have a sun
goddess as well as a sun-god. Several of the names
in this list are of much interest. Thus we find
(1. 63) Pa-su-du=Gk. Parsondes, 2 a name explained as Mi-it-ra=M.itm (Mithras) ; and, as noticed (Vol. I.
102), Maganda-anna (' Ship-of-the-Canal-of-heaven '),
=(primarily) the Sun, and, by reduplication, a con
stellation, probably Argo. In 1. 67 we have an
ideograph, the pronunciation of which is explained to
be Kas-se-ba, or possibly Rak-seba (' Lady-of-corn ')
=the Fertilizer, primarily the Sun,, as combining
male and female potentialities. It would be strictly in accordance with numerous similar examples, if the
female-sun-name Kasseba had been reduplicated in a
constellation-figure ; and the Semite would, when it reached him, alter, mould, and understand the name
in his own way and according to his own language
(Vide Vol. I. 38). Provisionally, therefore, we may accept Kasseba as the northern paranatellon of the
Ram in the Euphratean Planisphere. According to Tab. K. 3464, 18, Kasb&, apparently a goddess, is to ' be invoked with the goddesses Istar and Nana.
In W. A. I. II. xlix. 67 mention is made of the

probably see early Bab. influence. The Arabs after
wards adopted the Gk. name under the form Kikaiis.
We bracket Cepheus with the Twins, not strictly as a
paranatellon, but in default of any other constellation, the region immediately north of the Tivins and Crab
being occupied by the dark part of Auriga, Lynx and
Camelopardalis. The Shepherd (Ak. Siba) is akin to the King, a frequent title of Cepheus ; and we may provisionally pair the constellation Ualuzun with the
Twins,
Excepting a part of the Great Bear, there is no
constellation of importance north of the Crab until
we reach the Lesser Bear and the Pole. The 7 stars
of Ursa Min. are such an exact reduplication on a
lesser scale of the 7 stars of the Wain, that it is
difficult to suppose that the former, as well as the



IX] BABYLONIAN CREATION-SCHEME. 21
latter, were not early united in a constellation-figure. The Great Bear implies a Lesser Bear, and I think
that the Long-chariot (Margidda, sup. p. 17) equally implies a Short- or Small-chariot (Ak. *Marturra). This name I have not yet found in the cuneiform
(Vide Vol. I. 269) ; but, in further illustration of
what I have already said respecting the Bears and
Chariots as guardians of the Pole, we may remember that the star a Ursae Min. has always been known
as the ' Chariot '-star, the Alrucaba of the Alphonsine
Tables, otherwise Errucchaba, Arrucabatho, etc. All probability points to the Chariot (Bab. Rukubu, Heb.
Rekhev) as being originally like Margidda, the name,
not of a single star, but of the constellation. At
present, therefore, I would bracket *Marturra with the Crab}
In Tab. K. 2894, Ob. 1. 12 mention is made of
the constellation Nutsirda (' Prince-of-the- Serpent '),
called in Sem. Namassu (' the Keptile ').
2 ' Its stars '
(kakkabdni-su) are spoken of, and we may identify it with the Snake-holder. In W. A. I. V. xlvi. 29
the asterism Tsir (' the Snake/=>7, , Ophiuchi) appears as a lunar mansion. There are, of course,
various celestial Snakes. 3 Nutsirda is also mentioned
in 1. 44 of the same Tablet, and is explained as ' the
1 Vide inf. p. 189 in voc. Antasurra.
2 Here, as in very many instances, the Sem. equivalent is not an exact translation.
3 A very interesting Tablet (81-2-4, 224) treats of Tsir Anim, Tsiru Msu, Tsir makhkh sam% Tsir Ea, etc. (' The Serpent of
Ami, the Double Serpent, the Great Serpent of heaven, the Serpent of Ea,' etc.). Nabukudurra-utsur III. erected ' bulls of bronze and
huge serpents
' at the thresholds of the gates of Babilu {India
House Ins. of Nebuchadrezzar, Col. vi. 16-18), as daimonic warders
and celestial guardians (Vide Vol. I. 361).



2 2 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [iX
god Sagimu' (Vide inf. p. 96). It will be remembered that the more important stars and constellations
were also regarded as gods. In W. A. I. V. xlvi. 20 we find the asterism Kakkab
Ansu-kurra (' The Animal-from-the-East,' i.e., the Horse) which Prof. Hommel (Astron. der alt. Chal.
iii. 16) explains as ' der Pegasus/ Ansu-kurra is
certainly a lunar asterism, but there may be two stellar Horses ; and, if so, we have here the Horse as
the paranatellon of the Water-pourer. Of course a southern Horse no more excludes a northern Horse
than a, southern Fish or Crown a northern Fish or
Crown. The Pegasus was well known in the art of
western Asia (Vide Vol. I. 215, 308 ; inf. p. 48). In W. A. I. III. ]iii. No. 1, 1. 71 mention is made
of ' the-constellation- of-the- Pregnant -ivoman,' and
' the star Double-eye
'
(Vide inf. p. 115). Here, Eritu
(' the Pregnant-woman ') a name of Istar (Vide MussArnolt, As. Diet. p. 109)=the constellation An
dromeda. Istar-Aphrodite was called MvXirra (Herod,
i. 131), i, e. (Bab.) Mulidtu (' the Bearer'), and she would be the original female figure afterwards called
Adamath (=Andromeda. Vide Vol. I. 50) by the
Phoenicians. The star Sibi ('Double-eye') will be
Algol (Ar.) Al-Ghul ('the Ogre') or demon-monster
of the waste,=/5 Persei. ' A star of the second
magnitude during two days and thirteen and a half
hours, it suddenly decreases, and in three hours and a half descends to the fourth magnitude. Then its
brightness regains the ascendant, and at the end of a fresh interval of three hours and a half attains its
maximum '
(Guillemin, The Heavens, 7th edit.,
p. 307). This darkening of the Ogre's eye reminds us of the world-wide story of Polyphemos. The



ixj BABYLONIAN CREATION-SCHEME. 23
cause of the apparent changes in Algol is the inter
vention of a dark body between it and the Earth.
Thus, the single starry eye is duplicated. The Ak.
form of the Bab.-As. Eritu or Eratu is probably Ama
or Erne. We may now, therefore, complete the grouping of the zodiacal and northern constellations
as follows :
Ram Gassiepeia (=Ak. Kasseba). Twins Cepheus (=Ak. Ualuzuri). Grab Lesser Bear (=Ak. *Marturra, otherwise Antasurra). Glaws Snake-holder (=Ak. Nutsirda).
Water-pourer Horse (=Ak. Ansu-kurra). Fishes Andromeda (=Sem. Eritu).
An arrangement of the southern companions of the zodiacal Signs would probably be as follows :
Ram Stream (=Ak. Pur-edin and Hid-ili-Ningirsu). 1
Bull Orion (=Ak. Sibzianna-Duzi-Ningirsu). Twins Dogs (=Ak. Lik and Pallika).
GrabArgd (=Ak. Maganda-anna). Lion Water-snake and Bowl (=Ak. Tsir-gal and Lut-tsirna).
Virgin Grow ( Ak. Imdugudkhu).
Glaws Gentaur (=Ak. Gudelim). Scorpion Wolf (=Ak. Ligbat).
Archer Altar (=Ak. Kisalbatala).
Goat%
W,ater-pourer Southern Fish (=Ak. Siladakhabi). Fishes Sea-monster (=Ak. Kumar,
1 Nin-girsu (' the Lord-of-the-Bank.' Vide S. 1366, Ob. 1. 3, 4)
=Tammuz (Vide Sayce, Rel. And. Babs. p. 244). Hid means
'river,' cf. Hid-deqel (Gen. ii. 14),=(Ak.) Hid-dagal ('Great
river'). The ' River ' of Ningirsu-Tammuz, therefore, = the 'fiptWos 7roTafxb<s of Hipparchos,=the 'H/oi8avos,=Sem. ErU-edinu. In Tab. Sm. 1510 'the River of the god Ningirsu' is mentioned, together
with Allab ( = Cancer) and other stars. Unfortunately the whole of the Tablet is not before me. As to Pur-edin, vide inf. p. 96.
Pur-edin=($Qm.) EriL-edinu (' Strong-one-of-the-Plain '), i.e., the Euphrates.



24 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [IX
As regards the Sea-monster, in W. A. I. III. lxix. 75
'the god (Ak.) Bis-gaV ('Great-dragon.' Vide Vol. 1. 90) is mentioned ; and in W. A. I. IV. xxi. 65 Bisgal is
explained as (Sem.) Mamluv (' Sea- monster '). As
Bis also means ' Hero,' in a solar point of view the
' Great-hero '
is the Sun ; but in a constellational
aspect the (star) god Bisgal=tha Sea-monster. As
regards the Goat, I am unable to say what star or
constellation bounded it on the south in the Euphratean
scheme. If a star, it may have been y Grids, for the
brighter stars of the Crane would be continually
beneath the horizon as viewed from Babylonia. We
are now in a position to reconstruct the Euphratean
Planisphere of 36 stars or constellations in accordance
with the Creation Tablet and the account of Diodoros ;
and, after making due allowance for the uncertainties
in some instances, we nevertheless obtain a very
reliable general result, which appears in full as follows :

CHAPTER X.
Constellation-Subjects in Euphratean Art.
Modern researches have revealed to us an important
fragment, although only a fragment, of Euphratean art, and just as Hellenic coin-types show us constella
tion-subjects in astonishing numbers and in remark
able variety, so similarly do these representations,
including actual and obvious constellation-figures,
appear plentifully in the surviving remnants of the art of Babylonia. Without attempting any exhaustive treatment of Euphratean art in this connexion, it will
suffice for my present purpose to notice a number of
illustrative instances chiefly supplied by boundary
stones, contract Tablets, and cylinders. The reader will observe the general harmony in the matter
between Euphratean literature and Euphratean art,
e.g., as the Signs of the Zodiac appear in the former, so likewise are they found in the latter. I do not
intend to enter on many doubtful and difficult points
connected, but merely to indicate clearly the general result. Amongst other instances of constellation
subjects on the monuments we have I. Stone of Nabukudurra-utsur J., not later than
b.c. 1150 (Figured in W. A. I. V. lvii., etc.). The
representation on the Stone is divided by lines into
6 compartments, one above another. The first or
uppermost compartment contains the Crescent-moon
in the centre, with the Sun on one side of it and the



X] CONSTELLATION-SUBJECTS. 29
planet Venus on the other (Vide inf. p. 32). With its head over the Crescent-moon and its body
stretching down by the side of the compartments
to the 5 th of them, is a Great-serpent (=primarily,
the Milky-way, and (2) Hydra, vide VoL I. 105). The 2nd compartment contains 3 Altars, each sur
mounted by a conical stone (Cf. the Triangle, Vol. I.
50-52), and each placed under one of the above
mentioned heavenly bodies. The 3rd compartment
contains a Demi-monster (cf. Ligbat-Therion, sup. p. 5), whose body is half concealed by a kind of
altar ; and a Demi-goat (=Capricom), similarly half concealed. The 4th compartment contains (1) the
head and upper part of the body of a crested Snake,
which exactly corresponds to the head and upper part
of Ophis as held by Ophiouchos; (2) a Twy-headed-dog with serpentine body, which is not a constellation
figure but a symbol of Tutu, the Death-god, and which reappears westwards on coins of Kyzikos (Vide
Vol. I. 177) ; (3) a Horse's head and neck (Cf. Hippos)
upright on a sort of altar ; and (4) a Crow or Eaven
(Cf. Korax) perched upon an upright stone. The 5th compartment contains the figure of the King seated,
with a kind of Gryphon-greyhound by his side. In
front of him stands his Guardian-genius, human to the
waist, and drawing a bow, with the body and tail of a
scorpion and the legs and feet of a bird of prey, in
fact a combination of Toxotes, Skorpios, and Aetos,
the whole forming what Classic art would style a
gryllus. These symbolical combination-figures, e.g., man-headed bulls or lions, form perhaps the most
familiar feature in Euphratean art. The potencies of
the Archer-, Scorpion-, and Eagle-gods are united in
the King's protector. The 6th and last compartment



30 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [x
of the Stone shows (1) an Ox, Bull (Cf. Tauros), or Cow, couchant, above whose back appears a huge and con
ventionally drawn Ear-of-corn (=Stachys, Sirica) ; (2) a Tortoise (=Cancer) ; (3) a Scorpion (=Scor
pios ; and (4) a Lamp on a pedestal, almost grasped
by the claws of the Scorpion (Vide Fig. x. p. 233). Of this last combination I have treated at length
in Z, and in C. E. A., sec. viii., and will, there
fore, only here remark that amongst the technical
names of the Signs of the Zodiac we find (Ak.) bir ap
plied to the 7 th Sign. Upon this Strassmaier observes
that bir (' die alte Form fiir ud ')=nuru (' light '), and
that in fitting the Bab. constellation -figures on the
monuments to the Signs of the Zodiac we have : die
Lampe als Nuru '
(Astron. aus Babylon, p. 171). In the Lamp, then, we have one variant form of the
original 7th Sign (Vide Vol. I. 68-71). The Stone of Nabukudurra-utsur I. is a Charter of
freedom and certain privileges bestowed by him on a
friendly city, but we are not here concerned with the
historical aspect of the matter. We observe that
these uranographic Euphratean Charter- and Boundary
Stones, incorrectly called by MM. Epping and
Strassmaier ' Thierkreise,' for they are not Zodiacs, display combinations of constellations and other
figures, e.g., sun and moon, portrayed in their character of daimonic guardians, and not according
to astronomical position. The figures are generally called, and with considerable although not absolute
correctness, ' emblems of the gods.' From their thrones on high the host of heaven look down with
myriads of burning eyes, and behold the evil man
removing his neighbour's landmark that he may add
field to field, and are prepared to punish and avenge.



x] CONSTELLATION-SUBJECTS. 3 1
The stars are gods, and, to a considerable extent, the
gods are stars.
The Ox or Bull with the Ear-of-corn is a combination which frequently appears on the monuments
(Vide C. E. A., Fig. vii. p. 11. From an unpub
lished Tablet in the Berlin Museum). A Cylinder of
black marble in the National Library, Paris (Figured
in Perrot and Chipiez, Hist, of Art in Chal. and As.
ii. 145), shows two Oxen, one behind the other, with
the great Ear-of-corn behind each. MM. Perrot and
Chipiez remark, this '
cylinder which, from its style, M. Menant does not hesitate to ascribe to the first
Chaldaean monarchy, represents two oxen in a field of
wheat.' It is quite erroneous thus to interpret cylin
der scenes, which, like the scenes on Greek vases, are
very rarely taken from the incidents of actual life.
Oxen were not turned into high-standing wheat-fields
in ancient Babylonia any more than at present. There is only one Ear-of-corn to each Ox, which, as
a delineation of a heavy Bab. wheat crop, would be
absurd ; and the duplication of the Ear-of-corn and
of the Ox is merely a matter of pattern, and not in
tended to represent numbers. No one, I presume, would say that the Bull or Ox with the Ear-of-corn
on the Stone of Nabukudurra-utsur, represents an agricultural scene ; and the same design, when found
elsewhere, must be uniformly interpreted. This same
Cylinder is also reproduced in Maspero, Dawn of Civil
ization, p. 766, and styled
' the Farm Oxen.' This
aspect of the matter is that off-hand way of looking at
things which first suggests itself to the mind, and
which people are fond of dignifying as ' the common
sense view.' However, in dealing with symbolism, which, go back into the past as far as we may, we



32 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [x
still find in full force, it is rather uncommon sense
which is required. The Host of Heaven, as depicted
on boundary stones, etc., are naturally generally headed by representations of the sun and moon, and
a third star-figure which is usually supposed to portray the planet Venus. Thus we find ' c. 1100 B.c.
Upper part of a black boundary stone. Nippur. Upper section : Disc of the sun, crescent, Venus '
(Hilprecht, Bab. Ex. of the Univer. of Pen. 1896,
Vol I. Pt. ii. p. 67, PI. xxv. No. 69). In this repre
sentation the solar star is half enclosed by the cres
cent,=the Sun is in the arms of the Moon, a fruitful
origin of mythological stories about sun-nurturing goddesses. By its side is the second eight-rayed star, of
nearly the same size, which may possibly also represent the sun as distinct from and independent of the
moon, although the opinion that it symbolises IstarVenus is very likely correct.
Thus, on this Stone of Nabukudurra-utsur, which
is a usual specimen of the kind, we find representa
tions of an Altar, Triangle, Wild-beast, Serpent, Goat, Snake's head, Horse, Raven, Bidl or Ox, Ear
ofcom, Tortoise (=Cancer. Vide Vol. I. 207-11), Scorpion, Lamp (=lighted Altar), Archer, and Dog. Also two Dogs' heads, united together on the body of a snake (demi), and rather reminding us of
the close link between Sirius and Procyon. In
short, every figure upon the Stone, except those of the King, Sun, Moon, and Venus, is either a constellation-form or else is closely akin to one. Such a
proportion excludes accident, and implies a general
principle of representation. II. Stone of MarMuhu-Balddan L, cir. B.C. 1325
(Figured in Geo. Smith, As. Dis. p. 236, etc.). This



x] CONSTELLATION-SUBJECTS. $3
*
large white stone, about 3 feet high/ bears an in
scription 'of 115 lines giving an account of a field
of which this was the boundary or memorial stone,'
and which had been given by the king to one of his
servants for State services. In Col. iii. curses are
invoked on any remover of the Stone, ' the gods Aim,
Bel and Ea, Ninip and Gula, these divinities, and all the divinities on this stone tablet whose emblems are
seen, violently may they destroy his name.' We may
know the divinities of the Signs to some extent from
the divinities of the months, which were as follows :
Nisannu, Anu and Bilu ; Airu, Ea ; Sivanu, Sin (the
Moon-god) ; Duzu, Ninip ; Abu, Ninkigal (' Queen-of
the-mighty-land,' i.e., Hades), Sem. Allat (' the Unwearied '); Ululu, Istar (=Parthenos) ; Tisritu, Samas ;
Arakh-samna, Maruduku ; Kislimu, Nirgal ; Dhabitu,
Papsukala (Vide B, B. Jr., L. K. 0. p. 33) ; Sabadhu, Ramanu ; and Addaru, ' the Seven Great-gods
' (=Ph.
Kabirim). The pictorial portion of the stone is divided into three compartments, the uppermost of which contains representations of the Crescent-moon,
Sun, Venus, a Lamp, Scorpion, Bird of some kind,
perhaps an Eagle, Dog, Dog-headed-demi-snake,
Demi-snake with a nondescript head, and lighted Altar. The centre compartment contains a Bird
[Eagle or Raven) ; Ox, Bull, Cow, or Calf, couchant,
surmounted by the Ear-of-corn (the Istar symbol) ; a Wild-beast of some kind ; another nondescript crea
ture of somewhat similar type ; and a Ziqqurdt or
^tor-temple -tower in stages (Vide Vol. I. pp. 69, 327), a symbol of Samas, the Sun-god, lord of the 7th month. The 3rd compartment contains a Great
serpent, Goat-fish, Wild-beast, apparently winged, and two other dubious figures. Thus there is a VOL. II. 3



34 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [x
general, although not an absolute, agreement between this Stone and that of Nabukudurra-utsur, showing the widespread use on monuments of the kind of a
certain list of well-known symbols or emblems, nearly
all of them constellation-figures. III. Stone from Bdbilu recording sale . of land.
Cir. b.c. 1100 (Figured in W. A. I. III. xlv. No. 1).
This circular black Stone shows near its apex the
Moon both full and crescent, the crescent being a
segment of the full orb ; the Sun, and Venus (if it be
Venus), the patterns of both being almost identical
with those on No. II. The Great-serpent is drawn
right across two-thirds of the circle, wTith its tail
hanging down outside. As I have observed else
where (Academy, Jan. 9, 1892, p. 43), this position
very fairly represents the TaXa^lag in November, when it stretches overhead between Gemini and Auriga on one side, and Orion and Taurus on the
other, through Perseus, Cassiopeia, and Cygnus
above us, descending westwards through Aquila. I have already referred to the connexion between
Hydra and the Via Lactea (Vide sup. p. 29). Near
the Serpent's head appear the Scorpion and Lamp ; whilst in the outer circle, with several other figures,
occur the two Dogs' heads (Vide sup. p. 32), the
Dog, Eagle, Raven, * Wild-beast, Ear-ofcorn, Tor
toise, fire (planetary) Altars, and a Yoke. This latter object appears more than once in the Sphere. Thus
the Ecliptic is regarded as a yoke thrown across heaven ; and Niru (' the Yoke ') was apparently a
popular name for the Goat-fish (Vide Vol. I. 81). IV. The like (Figured Ibid. No. 2). On this are
shown the Moon (as in the last instance), Sun, Venus,
two Dogs1 heads (Cf. Sirius and Procyon), the Dog,



x] CONSTELLATION-SUBJECTS. 35
Eagle, Raven (the birds, as frequently, are drawn in
a conventional manner), Wild-beast, Ear-of-com,
Scorpion, Lamp, and Demi-goat The Great-serpent stretches along the circumference of half the circle, a
position which exactly shows the TakaQas in May, when it nearly skirts the horizon from east, by north,
to west, disappearing in the west below Canis Minor.
Alike in Nos. III. and IV. the Hyena is shown, which
we also meet with in the lunar Zodiac (Vide inf. p. 68).
V. The Michaux Stone (Figured in Maspero, Dawn
of Civ. pp. 762-3 ; described and translated by MM.
Oppert and Menant in Records of the Past, ix. 89
et seq.). An ovoid basalt stone, 17 inches in height
and 24 in circumference, found by M. Michaux in
1800 near the ruins of Ktesiphon, and now in the
Cabinet des Medailles, Paris. On the top are repre
sented the Crescent-moon and the Sun ; then follow
four Altars and the kneeling Demi-goat (Vide No. IV.), two more Altars, a Triangle, the Wild-beast, the
Hyena, Scorpion, Eagle, Raven, Lamp, Dog, Greatserpent, and ' a downward pointed Arrow,' with several
other figures. The Inscription relates to a field near
' the town of Kar-nabu,' and contains the usual
imprecations upon anyone who shall interfere with
the Boundary-stone, etc.
VI. Stone of the House of Ada (British Museum).
The general design of the figures is the same as that of No. V., the Altars, Eagle, Raven, Goat, Dog,
Scorpion, Great- serpent, and Wild-beast being shown, and also ' a kind of Lyre.'
VII. Another British Museum Boundary-stone.
This stone shows the (1) Dog (Vide Fig. xiv. p. 239)
in the exact position described by Aratos, i.e., salient,
'
standing on both hind feet ' (H D. 327). This atti



3 6 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [x
tude has ever since been preserved in good delinea
tions of the constellation-figure when grouped with others. Thus, the Dog so appears on the Farnese
Globe, in Cicero's Ardtos, in the Planisphere of Geruvigus, in the interesting sheet of constellation
figures appended by Sherburne to his edition of
Manilius published in 1673, in the Oxford Aratos
of 1672, in Flamsteed's Atlas, and generally in
modern representations. (2) The kneeling Bull, Cow,
or Calf, with (3) the Ear-of-corn (Figured in H. D.
p. 82). (4) The Water-snake (Figured in lb. p. 83), near which (5) the Scorpion. (6) Head and neck of
crested Snake (Cf. Ophis ; vide No. I.). (7) Tortoise
or Turtle (Yide No. I.). And (8) a winged armless
human figure with serpentine legs interlocked. An Etruscan *
figure placee sur chacune des faces d'un
socle triangulaire, de bronze, qui a du. servir de base a un candelabre '
(Lajard, Culte de Venus, PI. xxiv.
No. 15) is the only other similar instance known
to me. This singular design reminds us of the
Ophioneus-Boreas myth (Vide Vol. I. 304-5). VIII. Composite Creatures. These, like the Chim
aira (Vide Vol. I. 216), are often formed or partly formed
of constellation-subjects, e.g., (1) the Scorpion-Archer
in No. I. (2) An armless winged human - headed
scorpion - bodied creature with feet something like
lions' paws (From a Boundary-stone). (3) The Fishgod, Ea-Oannes. (4) The primeval monsters men

man-headed bulls, satyrs, fish-tailed dogs, dog-headed
horses, horse-headed fish (sea-horses), etc. (5) Various
forms of gods and genii, e.g., man-headed, winged
bulls ; man - headed, winged lions ; winged bulls,

and hoofs, etc. Amongst this division may be in
cluded divers evil genii, e.g., those with leonine heads,
human bodies, and birds' feet, the Tiamat-monster, the Dragon-of-the-deep, the Demon of the south-west
wind with deformed human body, goats' horns, wings, and birds' claws. (6) Fantastic animals, some more or
less symbolical, others perhaps chiefly the outcome of
sportive fancy. Such are (a) the Gryphon, a winged
eagle-headed lion ; (b) the Winged-horse (Pegasos. Vide Perrot, Hist, of Art in Chal. ii. 171, Fig. 89) ;
(c) the Unicorn, whose combat with the Lion (Vide
K. B. Jr., U.), is duly shown on the monuments (Vide
Perrot, Hist. ii. 165, Fig. 83); (d) a composite
Creature (National Library, Paris ; figured in Perrot, Hist. ii. 168, Fig. 87) with a bull's head, ram's horns,
body, tail, and fore paws of a lion, hind legs, feet, and
wings of an eagle, and mouth of an unnatural forma
tion. With the connected symbolism in all these
instances we are not here concerned. I merely note
that in the case of the Composite Creatures, as in that
of the Boundary and Monumental Stones, constella
tion-subjects on the whole greatly predominate. IX. Ordinary representations of animals, etc. As the Homeric Poems and the Greek Coin-types contain
all or almost all of the constellation-subjects (Vide Vol. I. chaps. V. VI.), so does ordinary Euphratean art. The Ram, Bull, Crab, Lion, Virgin (Istar), Altar,
Scorpion, Archer, Goat, Urn, Urn-bearer, Fish,
Horse, Serpent, Dog, Crow or Raven, Boivl, Centaur,
Ship, Wild-beast, Charioteer, Lyre, Lammergeier,
Eagle, Bird, Kneeler, Wain, Ploughman, Crown,
Triangle, Arrow, and Hare all appear upon the monuments, under which term I do not here include
seals and cylinders. Specific references are unneces



3& PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [x
sary, as we have only to turn to the familiar works of
Layard, Rawlinson, Perrot, Maspero, and others to
find representations of all these constellation-subjects. The god Ningirsu (=0ridn, vide Vol. I. 93) appears on a brick from Lagash (Telloh), of which place he
was the patron-divinity (Vide De Sarzec, Decouvertes
en Chaldee, PI. xxii. No. 5). The Bear appears
on a bronze bowl (Vide Canon Kawlinson, Anct. Mons.
i. 528). X. Bronze Plaque showing the four divisions of the
Universe (Figured in Perrot, Hist, of Art in Chat.
i. 351, etc.). The divisions of the Plaque are separ
ated by bands, and the first and highest represents Heaven. It contains the familiar emblem of the
Winged-disk enclosing a human figure, which the
Assyrians appropriated to Assur; the Sun and Crescent-moon, Seven Stars (which possibly=the
Wain), and several other symbols of the celestial
powers. The second division, which represents the
Air, is occupied by 7 genii, 5 of whom are lion-headed and the other two have heads of some other animal or
bird. They are the Powers of the Air and follow each
other in line, each with the right hand uplifted and
the left held down. In the third division, which
represents the Earth, a dead body is shown on a bier, at the head and foot of which stands a Fish-god (the
Cannes type). Behind one of these, two lion-headed
genii are shaking hands, and behind one of the latter
stands another figure apparently bull-headed. The
last, lowest, and largest division represents the Underworld. At the bottom of it flows the river of death,
in which 5 fish appear. On the left bank of the river,
which is indicated by a raised line, grow shrubs or
reeds, three of which are shown. ' A hideous monster



X] CONSTELLATION-SUBJECTS. 39
advances on the river bank. Its semi-bestial, semi
human head is flat and scarred, with a broad upturned
nose and a mouth reaching to the ears. The upper
part of its body is that of a man, although its skin is
seamed all over with short vertical lines meant to
indicate hairs. . . . His tail is upturned, his feet are
those of a bird, and his wings show over his left
shoulder. ... A small boat glides down the stream '
(Perrot, Hist, of Art in Choi. i. 352-3). So far we
have exactly an earlier delineation of the Under-world
as painted by Polygn6tos in the Lesch6 at Delphoi
(Vide Paus. X. xxviii.) :
1 The dim stream of Acheron, with its reeds
And gliding ghosts of fishes indistinct.
Nigh the dim river, gnashing hateful fangs Crouches the fiend Eurynomos. He eats, The Delphians told us, flesh from dead men's bones.'
(R. B. Jr., Tellis and Kleobeia).
In the boat on the river is a Horse, its right fore-leg
bent, as if with the weight of the monstrous goddess
Allat, queen of the Under-world, who kneels upon one
knee on its back. She has the head of a lioness and
lion-cubs spring towards her breasts, one on each side.
Her body is like that of a huge hairy ape and she has
eagles' feet ; in each hand she grasps a large snake by
the throat, and so is an Ophiouchos. M. Maspero (Dawn of Civ. p. 691) calls each snake 'a real ani
mated javelin.' In front of the goddess and in one
corner of the division is shown a group of objects con
sisting of a horse's foot, bottles, etc., which are sup
posed to be ' funeral offerings.' Lastly, between the legs of Allat a Scorpion is dimly shown. Here we
have an illustration of the pre-constellational aspect



4-0 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [x
of the Snake and the Scorpion, as connected with
death and darkness. A kind of monster, the Usum
gallu (' Monster - viper,' King ;
*
Solitary - monster,'
Sayce) was supposed, like Eurynomos,
' Sarkophagos, corruption's hideous tooth, Which fastens on these vestures of decay.'
(R. B. Jr., Tellis and Kleobeia),
to devour the corpses of the dead (W. A. I. II. xix.
No. 2, Rev. 1. 12). In this scene, as so frequently in Classic art, the Horse is a creature connected with
death and the grave.
We next approach the highly important group of Cylinders, and will first take zodiacal subjects (Vide
Lenormant, Les Origines, i. 237-8). XI. The Zodiac Aries. Lenormant gives the
following instances of the zodiacal Ram or Ibex from
Lajard, Culte de Mithra, viz., PI. xvi. 1 ; xvii. 6 ;
xxvii. 1 ; xxix. 6 ; lii. 6 ; liv. A 12. Whilst I by no
means dispute this view, I think it is not exhaustive
of the facts of the case. As in Ak. times the com
mencement of the year was regulated by the position of the Goat-star (Capella)
' in relation to the new
moon at the vernal equinox
'
(Sayce, Herod, p. 402) ; so some of these representations of the Ibex-ram in all
probability originally referred to Capella, and were transferred to Hamal (' the Ram,' a Arietis) when in
process of time that became the leading star of the
year (Vide R. B. Jr., Z. p. 4). In W. A. I. III. lii.
No. 3, Rev. 1. 8, we read, Mitkharti ris sandti sa
kakkab Dilgan (' The appearance at the beginning of
the year of the star Messenger-of-light '). This Lenor
mant {Les Origines, i. 263) regards as a Arietis, and so perhaps it may ultimately have been when the year
began in Aries ; but originally it would be Capella,



X] CONSTELLATION-SUBJECTS. 4 1
in connexion with a year-commencement in Taurus.
Anyone who has studied the Cylinders will have no
doubt respecting their general character, and will have no difficulty in recognizing various constellation
figures. Thus, we find frequent representations of Sun, Moon, and the Seven Stars (perhaps=the Wain) ; of the Sun-god and the Moon- god, of the Air-god
(Ak. Mermer, ' the Very-glorious,' Sem. Ramanu, ' the Exalted '), and of various other divinities of the
heavens, standing with and between certain celestial
symbols, emblems, and forms, amongst which it is easy to recognize the Signs of the Zodiac and various
other constellation-figures. Thus in Lajard, PI. xvi. 1 above referred to, we have at one end of the cylinder
(l) the 7 Stars, (2) below which, a large 6-rayed Star,
(3) below which, an animal rudely drawn, Ibex, Goat,
or Ram, apparently standing on a star ; and the
symbol of Capella, Hamal, Aries, or of all of them in (historical) succession. The Ibex-ram is also well
shown in Lajard, PL xxxvi. 11, where it appears in
a scene with several other constellation-subjects,
amongst which are Istar ( Virgo) with her Ear-of
corn (Spica), the Eagle, etc. In PL lvi. 8 the Ram
appears with the Bull. PL xxxv. 7 presents a curious
combination of Signs. Eamanu (Aquarius) holds an
Urn, from which water flows in a double stream. By
one of the streams are the two Fish. Two human
figures (Gemini) of the Gilgames-type stand together in corresponding attitudes over an Eagle. Next
comes Grilo;ames bearing over his ri^ht shoulder a
Crab or Turtle at the end of a stick, and holding in
his left hand a pair of Fish. Next stands the Ibex
ram, with reverted head, an attitude usual to Aries,
which is now, as in past ages, so depicted. To pretend



42 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [x
to give an exhaustive explanation of such a combina
tion would, considering our present state of knowledge
or ignorance, be absurd. What is obvious, is that here, as in numerous other examples, we have nothing but
divine personages and constellation-subjects ; and we
may provisionally regard the design as representing the Sun in connexion with the Signs, whilst the
details are probably based on some archaic legends,
the real meaning of which had long been forgotten, such as the Kretan myth of the contest of Herakles
with Crab and Hydra (Vide Vol. I. 145).
XII. Taurus. Cylinder representations of the Bull are very numerous. The first group consists of those
which show him standing or crouching with the Air
god on his back, or led by the Air-god, or by some
other divinity (Vide Cullimore, Oriental Cylinders, Nos. 97, 107 ; Lajard, Quite de Mithra, PL xvi.
1, 2, 3 ; xviii. 1, 2). This combination forms the
prototype of the description of Aratos, ' the horned Bull fallen near the Drivers feet '
(H. D. 167). In
the second group of representations the Bull is simply delineated as a constellation-figure in the heavens
(Vide E. B. Jr., Z. Figs. 2, 3, 4 ; Lajard, PL xxxvi. 5,
lviii. 6, where ' the BidVs crouching legs,' H. D. 517,
are well shown).
XIII. Gemini. The Twins, generally a pair of
small human figures, appear repeatedly. The fact
that the pair originally represented sun and moon is
shown by the two figures being frequently drawn one above the other, head to head or feet to feet (Vide
Fig. vii. p. 231), i. e., when one is up, the other is down.
The moon rises as the sun sets (Vide Cullimore, 0. C
Nos. 65, 70, 95 ; Lajard, M. PL xxvi. 1). In Z. Fig. 7, p. 8, I have shown how this treatment of the



X] CONSTELLATION-SUBJECTS. 43
figures was adapted to the stars of the constellation
Gemini. It affords an excellent illustration of the
way in which constellation-figures came into existence.
In Lajard, M. PL xl. 9 ; xlix. 7, etc., the Pair stand
side by side. In PI. liv. B 7 they embrace.
XIV. Cancer. The Crab, a variant of the Scorpion
(Vide Vol. I. 60, 210), is frequently figured in a somewhat similar manner. It appears in Lajard, M.
PI. xxxv. 7 (Sup. p. 32), and liii. 4. In PI. liii. 3 it
is difficult to say whether two Crabs or Scorpions
are intended. (As to the Crab in art, vide Z.
sec. iv.)
XV. Leo. The Lion very frequently appears on the Cylinders and other monuments.
1. The Pre-constellational Lion. The two most
ordinary phases of this aspect of the (originally) solar Lion are (l) his contest with the Unicorn, Bull, or
Ox,=the contest between Sun and Moon ; and (2) his
contest with the Sun-god (Vide Vol. I. 34). Instances
of the latter occur in the familiar representation of
Gilgames holding a small lion in his left hand (Lajard,
M. PL xxiv.) ; fighting with a lion (Cullimore, 0. C. No. 97), holding up a lion by the hind leg (lb.
No. 102), or, as Herakles-Engonasin, holding up a lion over his head (lb. No. 39), or, again, on one knee
grappling with a lion (lb. No. 41). These combina
tions do not represent the feats of some early hunter
king. The group of ' le lion devorant le taureau ' is
also a very favourite subject in art, of which numerous
examples are given in Lajard, M. 2. The Const ellational Lion. The Sign Leo also
frequently occurs on the Cylinders. Thus Lajard, PL xxxviii. 4 represents the solar Gilgames over
coming the lunar Bull, a combination afterwards



44 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [x
reduplicated in the familiar group of Mithra and
the Bull. Figured, apparently in the air, and by the head of Gil games is his beast the Lion. In PI. lii. 6
the Lion appears with other constellation-figures, such as the Ibex-ram and the Hare. In PL lvi. 3 the
Lion is shown with the Lammergeier (=Lyra). XVI. Virgo. Istar-Parthenos and her Ear-ofcorn
very frequently appear on the Cylinders and on con
nected works of art (Vide K. B. Jr., V. Figs. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15). Thus we meet with Istar as a warrior
goddess (Figured in Maspero, Dawn of Civ. p. 670),
despoiled of her garments in the Under-world (lb. p. 695), and holding Duzi (=Tdimmuz- Orion) on her
knees (lb. p. 697). The pre-constellational character of the goddess is (l) lunar, and (2) as the planet Venus.
XVII. Ara (otherwise Chelai, ' the Claws '). Altars
innumerable occur on the Cylinders, as well as the
pre-constellational Altar, i.e., the solar circle. A good
example occurs in Lajard, M. PL xlii. 13. The Claws
of coarse appear with the Scorpion. In Lajard, M. xxviii. 11 the Altar appears guarded by the two
Scorpion-men (Vide inf. p. 55). XVIII. Scorpio. The Scorpion often appears on
the Cylinders, e.g., Lajard, M. PL xxvii. 10 ; xxxi. 2 ;
xxx vii. 6 ; liii. 3, etc. Sometimes a pair of Scorpions
are shown. These primarily represented Darkness, eastern and western (Vide Vol. I. 67).
XIX. Sagittarius. The Archer is represented on the monuments (1) As a man with a bow; (2) as a
Centaur; and, according to Lenormant, (3) by an
Arrow (Vide sup. p. 35), on the principle, familiar to symbolism, of a part for the whole.
In Lajard M. PL xiii. 8, he appears as a seated



X] CONSTELLATION-SUBJECTS. 45
Bowman . In PL liv. A 12 he is a Bowman kneeling on one knee near a star.
On a Cylinder, a copy of which was sent me by the
Earl of South esk, he appears in the usual type of
Sagittarius, except that his wing ends in a Gryphon's head, crowned, with bow drawn and arrow on the
string, galloping in pursuit of an Ibex or Goat (pos
sibly Capella on the opposite side of the heavens), near which a Bird is perched over a doorway.
On another Cylinder (Collection de Clercq, No.
363) he appears similarly in pursuit of an Ibex, but instead of a Bow, holds a sword in his right hand, and
his tail is that of a Scorp>ion.
This last instance naturally leads us to the con
sideration of the Sagittarius depicted on a Stone, cir. B.C. 1100, found at Babilu and now in the British
Museum. Tlie Archer in this instance is a winged
man-horse with bow and arrow drawn. Behind his
human head is the head of a Gryphon, his tail is that
of a Scorpion, and beneath him, with its claws
towards the genitalia, as in Mithraic representations
of the Bull and Scorpion, is a large Scorpion (Figured in Perrot, Hist, of Art in Phoen, ii. 204).
Another instance from a Boundary-stone now in
the British Museum (Fig. xii. p. 235) shows the
man-horse in a similar position, but with a human
head only, and a horse's tail.
XX. Capricornus. Perhaps no stellar figure is quite so prominent as that of the Goat, which is
equally connected with the Goat-stav (Capella) and
the 6roa-constellation (Capricornus). The numerous
class of Cylinders whose subject is the Goat-sacrifice
(Vide Collection de Clercq, Nos. 151-75) are almost
certainly connected with a Capella-v\t\m\ ; whilst the



46 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [:
Goat-Jish (Muna-Jcha) is also a frequent figure. The word itself is a cuneiform ideograph representing this
compound creature (Vide W. A. I. V. xlvi. No. 1, Rev.
1.2). In Cullimore, 0. C. No. 29, Capella and Capricorn
appear together, the former, held as usual on the left
arm, as the Aix Olenios (Vide Vol. I. 221) of the
Greek Sphere, the Goat on the arm of the Charioteer
in our modern star-maps. Capella opened the year
(Vide sup. p. 40), and Capricorn is the last of the Ak. lunar asterisms ; so that the two together either
represent the annual round in its totality, or indicate
some special ceremonies connected with the end and
the beginning of the year. Other instances of the
Goat-Jish occur in Cullimore, O. C Nos. 31, 32, 93,
and in Menant, Archives des Missions, 1879, p. 115,
where it appears on an altar.
In Lajard, M. PL xvi. 3, Capricorn appears in connexion with the crouching Bull, the human figure
on which, partly destroyed, is probably connected with the Auriga, and hence with Capella. Other
instances in which Capricorn is shown are PI. liv.
A
1, and PI. liv. B 7, where the Goat-Jish, a nocturnal
Sign, appears immediately under the Crescent-moon and next to the Urn, the adjoining constellation.
'A Babylonian agate' (Figured by Landseer, Sabaean Researches, 1823, p. 288, and reproduced in
E. S. R. Pt. i. 20) shows Capricorn, a perfect example of the Goatjish, beneath the Crescent-moon,
and above an object like a ladder placed lengthways,
the 6 rungs of which make 5 divisions, which probably
represent degrees, either 6 x 5=30, being -^ of a
circle of 360, or 5 x 2=10, being ^ of a circle of
120 (Vide sup. p. 9).



x] CONSTELLATION-SUBJECTS. 47
XXI. Aquarius. This Sign, as Lenormant notes,
is represented either by the god Kamanu, or simply by an Urn (Vide No. XX.). Instances occur in
Lajard, M. PL xxx. 4 ; xxxv. 3 ; liv. B 7 ; liv. A 12 ;
Cullimore, 0. C. Nos. 130, 131. XXII. Pisces. The two Fish are shown in Lajard,
M. PL xvi. 5 ; xxxi. 5 ; xxxv. 7 ; 1. 2 ; Cullimore,
0. C. No. 88, etc. A single Fish, perhaps the Piscis
Notius, appears in many instances. XXIII. Extra-zodiacal constellation-subjects the
Wain. It is probable that the 7 stars which are
shown on some Cylinders=the Wain. In Lajard, M.
PL xxxv. 4, they appear in a similar arrangement of 4 and 3 in a nocturnal scene, where the Crescent
moon, the Air-god, a large star (probably Venus), and the Twins are shown. In M. PL xxx. 7 they again
appear next to the Crescent-moon. In PL xxix. 6
they appear above an Ibex-goat standing on a star (=Capella), the Crescent-moon being also shown.
Other instances are PL xxix. 5 ; xxxii. 1 1 ; liv. 5.
In the Collection de Clercq, No. 344 bis, the same
combination of Crescent-moon, Seven Stars and Ibex
goat is shown. Vide also Cullimore, 0. C Nos. 19,
20, 21. XXIV. The Rneeler. Instances of a figure kneel
ing upon one knee are frequent on the Cylinders
(Vide Lajard, M. PL xxxi. 4, 7; xlix. 5; liv. B 14).
It is a usual attitude of Gilgames-Herakles, e.g., in his great contest with the Lion (lb. PL xix. 6 ; xxv.
3
; xxvi. 5), or when watering the celestial Bull
(Collection de Clercq, No. 461). XXV. The Birds.
1. Aquila. The Eagle is frequently represented. Thus, a Cylinder (De Sarzec, Decouvertes en Chaldee,



48 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. ( X
PL xxx. bis, No. 13) shows him carrying the ancient
hero Etana to heaven. Tn Lajard, M. PL xxxiii. 7, he
appears with the Lion. In M. PL xxx v. 7 he appears
with the Water-pourer, Fishes, Twins, and Crab.
2. The Lammergeier (=Lyra. Vide Vol. I. 35).
Appears in Lajard, M. PL xviii. 7, and again in PL
xxxvi. 11, with the Virgin, Ear-of-corn, Ram, etc.
Many late representations of the constellation, e.g., the Oxford Aratos of 1672, show a Lyre on an Eagle
displayed, thus combining the forms. 3. The Bird (Swan). Appears in Lajard, M. PL xxxii. 7, with the Water-pourer and the Bucranium
(==Taurus). Also in PL xxxiii. 1 with the Urn ;
in PL xxxiii. 5 with the Twins ; and in Cullimore,
0. C. No. 3.
4. The Raven, Appears in Lajard, M. PL xxxvi.
10 ; and in PL xi. 1, with Capella, the Hare, etc.
5. The Fight between Samas-Gilgames and the
Tempest-birds (Vide Vol. I. 234-5). In Lajard, M.
PL liv. B 11 is shown a fight between the Archer
sun and a huge Bird of night and. tempest, above whom is the Crescent-moon. In PL lxi. 7 Samas contends with the Triad of
Storm-birds, grasping one by the neck, another by the leg, and trampling on the third. This is the
pre-constellational aspect of the constellation-group
of Hercules, Sagitta, Aquila, Lyra, and Cygnus. Another Cylinder, a copy of which was sent to me by
the Earl of Southesk, shows a personage holding up a
huge bird, evidently subdued; and a Tablet (Layard,
Nineveh and Babylon, p. 609) shows four-winged, divinities holding up huge birds.
XXVI. The Winged-horse (Pegasos). A '
sujet
tire des sculptures d'un des palais assyriens de Nim
I



x] CONSTELLATION-SUBJECTS. 4$
roud ' shows a four-winged personage holding with either hand a winged-horse by the mane. The horses
stand one on each side of him on their hind legs
(Lajard, M. PL liv. C 5). For another instance
vide sup. p. 37.
The Winged-horse also appears on a Hittite seal
(lb. PL xliv. 3a), which has of late been frequently
reproduced. It is galloping with wings outspread, one below and the other above it. In the field are
the Crescent-moon, a Bull's head and 3 stars (Vide
Vol. I. 308).
In a later instance of West Asian art Pegasos
appears in his exact constellational form, as a winged
demi-horse, in the field the Crescent-moon and a star
(Lajard, M. PL xliii. 27). XXVII. The Snake-holder. The goddess Allat
holding a snake in each hand (Vide sup. p. 39), with a wild boar and dog at her breasts and standing on a
horse (Lajard, Culte de Venus, PL xvii. 1).
' De
couvert dans les ruines de Babylone.'
Personage holding with both hands a large snake
in front of him (Collection de Clercq, No. 131). In
Lajard, M. PL xii. 18 a seated personage is holding up what may be intended for a large snake.
A Hittite Cylinder (lb. PL lviii. 6) is of great
interest, as affording one of those rare examples of
constellation-figures on their passage between the Euphrates Valley and Hellas. Before the god Tarku,
who is bird-headed, winged, and on one knee, in the
Engonasin attitude, stand 3 human figures, one of whom holds a large snake in his left hand. Behind
him is the crouching Bull (Taurus), below which are
two other human figures, striking hands (=Gemini). Near them is a Dog, on a line with which are two VOL. II. 4



50 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [x
Lions, facing each other. At the upper part of the
Cylinder is an inscription in the Hittite script, which Lajard refers to as ' caracteres inconnus.' The cylin
der thus supplies positive proof that many, and therefore probably most, of the Euphratean constel
lation-figures were adopted by the Hittites, who would pass them on through Asia Minor, so that they ultimately reached Hellas by land as well as by sea
through the Phoenicians and others.
I may here appropriately notice a Phoenician repre
sentation of this constellation-figure (Figured by Canon Spano, Mnemosine Sarda ossia Ricordi e memorie di varii Monumenti Antiche con altre
rarita delV isola de Sardegna, Cagliari, 1864, and
reproduced by me in C. E. A. p. 31, Fig. 25). In the Tablet of the 30 Stars, Ophiouchos is called Mulu-bat
(' The Man-of-death '), and in describing the Phoeni
cian design I said :
' The Light-god who fights with the dark monster,
dragon, serpent, appears in most mythologies ; and as the Euphratean Sun-god grapples with the lunar Bull and with his own Lion, so does he seize the Serpent
or Dragon of darkness and chaos. This he does daily,
and especially when he becomes " the Man-of-death," i.e. when he descends into the Under-world. In this
[design] we see the winged and blinded Sun-god, as
Helios-Ophiouchos, grasping the Snake of darkness in the same manner, and with its head in a correspond
ing position to that of Serpens on our globes. The god is guided by a Kabeiric dwarf, and the student of
Hellenic mythology will remember that the myth
reappears there in the persons of the blinded Orion and his dwarf guide Kedalion of Lemnos, whose name
signifies one who takes charge of the dead (Vide



xj CONSTELLATION-SUBJECTS. 5 1
Eustathios, in 11. xiv. 294), and who is, therefore, a fitting guide for the man devoted to death ' (C E. A.
p. 31 ; vide G. D. M. ii. 276 et seq). Such an
instance as this shows that it is merely our loss of the
works on the Phoenician constellation-figures (Vide Vol. I. 149), which makes it somewhat difficult to
fully demonstrate the identity of the Greek and
Euphratean Signs. Had we the Hittite, Phoenician, and archaic Greek representations, the matter would
be obvious at a glance.
In Lajard, M. PL xvi. 4 is given the Cylinder representing a tree with a human figure seated on
either side of it, behind one of which figures, possibly
that of a woman, a large Snake is standing upright
on its tail. The design, as of course, strikingly reminds us of the Biblical account of the Fall of Man.
XXVIII. The Charioteer. A remarkable and
rudely-engraved Cylinder (Lajard, M. PL xli. 3 ; Cullimore, 0. S. No. 6) shows a human figure seated in a
large four-horse chariot, the horses being drawn one
above another. In front of this are two horned
animals joined together, and thus practically making
one, standing on their hind legs in the position called in heraldry counter-salient. Behind them is another
animal, very rudely drawn, but showing distinctly head, horns, tai] and four legs. Below these creatures
are two pairs of small human figures, each pair facing the other. It is, of course, easy to fall into error in
attempting to explain such occult groups ; but, at the same time, we are bound to suppose that the engraver
had a definite meaning, and the Cylinders generally are very largely taken up with celestial phenomena. Reasonable conjectures on such lines are therefore
permissible. I have shown elsewhere (U. p. 18 ;



52 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [x
L. K. 0. pp. 24-5) that the Unicorn -ibex-goats,
counter-salient, in the well-known Cylinder of the
Sun-gc-d and the Moon-god arranging for the preservation of kosmie order (Figured in Smith and Sayce,
Choi. Ac. Gen. p. .112), represent the 'monthly cycling progress of the moon there and back '
(coun
ter-salient) ; and I would similarly explain the two animals in one of this Cylinder as the two, yet one,
horned lunar Bulls. The other animal is the Goat
star (Capella) and the Charioteer=Auriga. The two pairs of Twins may be the Great-twins of the
lunar Zodiac, i.e., the Pleiades and Hyades, and the
Great Twins of the solar Zodiac (Gemini), i.e., Castor
and Pollux. Should this view be correct, we have here
a very complete picture of this portion of the heavens. In modern representations the Charioteer is gene
rally without his chariot, but never without his Goat ;
and this seems to be equally true in the case of
Euphratean representations of the constellation-figure. In numbers of instances the Goat is carried on the
arm of a personage who is probably Auriga or connected with him (Vide sup. p. 46), but who is with
out a chariot.
XXIX. The Triangle. Deltoton is shown in various
instances, e.g., Lajard, M. PI. xl. 5 ; Cullimore, 0. C No. 22.
XXX. The Stream. On many cylinders a stream of
water is conventionally represented, viz., as a row of coils of similar pattern. Thus in Lajard, M. PL xvi. 5 it is shown with a Fish above it and another Fish
below it. In PL 1. 3 it is placed next to two Hares,
just as the Potamos adjoins Lepus. In PL lii. 6 it is
next the Ibex-ram, and similarly we notice that the
Potamos is near Aries.



X] CONSTELLATION-SUBJECTS. 53
XXXI. The Hare. This animal often occurs on the
monuments. In Lajard, M. PL xxxvi. 13 a horned
personage holds up a Hare, near which is a Lam
mergeier. In PL xl. 7 two Hares are placed next
the Stream, as in another instance above noticed
(Vide No. XXX.). The design in PL xli. 2 is a Hare
chased by a Dog=Lepus and Sirius. In PL 1. 4 the
two Hares again adjoin the Stream. (For other
instances vide R. B. Jr., E. pp. 10-11 ; Vol. I. 97).
XXXII. The Dogs. This animal also often occurs
on the monuments. In Lajard, M. PL xv. 1 a person
age, armed with the Jchereb or sickle-shaped weapon of
the Sun-god, seizes a rearing Unicorn by the ear and
restrains it. Above the Unicorn is the Crescent
moon, and beneath its forepaws a very large Dog,
sejant. The subject of the cylinder is apparently the
triumph of the Sun-god over the Moon-god ; and the Dog, which is taking no part in the contest, and
therefore is not a solar dog, may possibly represent Canis Maj. or Sirhis, as the star-king. In PL xxxviii.
1 a large Dog is represented with the Olenian Goat
and Crescent-moon, etc. In PL xxxix. 4 a large Dog appears sejant, on an Altar (Vide also No. XXXI. ). In
PL xl. 2 by the side of the Crescent-moon is a large
6 -rayed star, beneath which is a large Dog, sejant,
apparently being invoked by a votary who stands before him with right hand raised. If this does not
refer to the Dog-star, it is impossible to explain the
combination. In PL liv. B 15 the large Dog, sejant,
appears with the Goat (Capella). I may here mention an Etruscan Mirror (Gerhard,
Etrushische Spiegel, ccxliii. A. No. 3), which shows
(in figures) Orion, Canis Maj. and Lepus not in correct celestial positions, for the Hare is over the



54 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [x
Dogs head the Crescent-moon, and the following
stars correctly placed, Aldebaran, Nath (/3 Tauri), Hamal, Pollux, liegulus, Menkalinam (fi Aurigae), and Capella. It may or may not be the result of
Greek influence, and is a rare instance of an ancient
star-map (Figured in E. S. R. Pt. i. 9). The details
of the long historical intercourse between the Phoeni
cians and the Etruscans are even now almost entirely unknown.
XXXIII. The Ship. In Lajard, M. PL 1. 8 there
is a representation of Gilgames and Aradea navigating their vessel. The ship of any famous mythical or
legendary voyage is naturally translated to the skies. XXXIV. The Water-snake. Merodakh attacking
the Great-serpent is shown on a cylinder belonging to Dr. S. W. Williams (Figured in Smith and Sayce, Choi.
Ac. Gen. p. 90). The same design is reproduced on an engraved stone said by Lajard (M. PL xii. 2) to be of the Sassanian period (Vide also Cullimore, 0. C.
Nos. 124-5). XXXV. The Bowl. The Bowl or Cup naturally appears on the cylinders and other monuments (Vide
Cullimore, 0. C. Nos. 120, 165; Lajard, M. PL
xxxiii. 11).
XXXVI. The Centaur and Wild-beast. This
constellation-group has developed out of representations of the contest of the Sun-god and the Darkness
monster ; and also, perhaps, of the contest between
Eabani, the friend of Gilgames, who has the horns,
legs, and tail of a bull, with a wild animal, lion, bull,
etc. (Vide Lajard, M. PL xv. 6 ; xxvii. 10 ; Vol. I.
110-12; Fig. xv. p. 241).
XXXVII. The Altar (Vide No. XVII. An ex
cellent instance of the Altar-censer (Vide Vol. I. 117),



X] CONSTELLATION-SUBJECTS. 55
guarded by the Scorpion-men of darkness, eastern
and western, appears in Lajard, M. xlix. 2. A
slightly variant representation of the same scene is
given in Cullimore, 0. C. No. 160. The Southern
Altar is of course a reduplication of the zodiacal
Altar, and the two form one of the many celestial
pairs, such as Bears, Wains, Goats, Bogs, Shepherds,
etc.
XXXVI II. The Sea-monster. Tiamat (Vide Vol. I.
89) overcome by Maruduku frequently appears on the cylinders and other monuments. In Lajard, M. PL
xxv. 1 the Sun-god, armed with his bow and arrow,
delivers the Moon-god from the Tiamat-dragon of darkness and chaos. The same contest is represented
in PJ. xxv. 5 and in PL xxxiii. 4 (Vide No. XXXIV.).
As the identification of many of the personages on
the cylinders is extremely doubtful, I do not at present attempt in detail to connect any of them with
the Bootes, Kepheus, Kassiepeia, Perseus, Andromeda, and Oridn of the Greek sphere. XXXIX. The Mithraic Group. The early Euphra
tean designs, both constellational and pre-constella
tional, continue to be repeated on numberless stones,
gems, seals, coins, and other works of art in Western Asia. Writers such as Lajard and Imhoof-Blumer
supply almost any amount of instances ; but with
these we are not at present concerned. I may, how
ever, refer to one striking example of the reappear
ance of Euphratean ideas and designs, namely, the group of figures, the centre of which is formed by
Mithra and the Bull. Mithraic representations have
been exhaustively collected by Prof. Cumont in his
great work Textes et Monuments Figures relatifs aux
Mysteres de Mithra, the second volume of which



56 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [x
appeared in 1896. I shall, however, here quote an instance or two from an earlier writer. Leonardo
Agostini Senese, Gemmae et Sculpt. Antiq. 1694,
PL i., gives the following Mithraic scene, which in many of its incidents is repeated in innumerable
examples. In the centre of the upper part of the
design stands Mithra, as the Sun-god, with large out
spread wings, and encircled by the Time-serpent, the Kampe slain by the solar Dionysos (Vide Vol. I. 302).
He is thus an Ophiouchos. At his right are 3
planetary Altars, and the Sun-god radiate in his car with four horses (=an Auriga). At his left are the
remaining 4 planetary Altars, and the Moon-godgoddess in a biga drawn by two horses. To the right
of the representation stands the Genius of morning
with uplifted torch, below whom is the Genius of
Evening with reverted torch. The remaining and
principal group shows Mithra stabbing the Bull, near whose head is a Bucranium, and whose tail at the end
is divided into two Ears-of-corn. This Mithraic Bull,
so far as art is concerned, is a reduplication of the
Euphratean Bull, the Amar-uda (Vide Tab. 79-7-8,
312), with whom Gilgames and Eabani contend,
or whom Gilgames waters (Vide sup. 47) ; and the peculiar artistic treatment of his tail is a reduplication
of the Bull and Ear-of-corn of the Euphratean monu
ments (Vide No. I.). He is surrounded by hostile
creatures in the Mithraic representation, a Dog, which
springs up to lick his blood ; a large Serpent, which bites him ; a Scorpion, which seizes on his genitalia.
Beside them is a small Lion, and above in the air
a Raven. One Cylinder (Lajard, M. PI. xxvii. 10) shows the combat between Eabani and the Bull, who
is also apparently threatened by a large Scorpion.



X] CONSTELLATION-SUBJECTS. 57
I am not here concerned with the explanation of all
this complicated Mithraic symbolism, or with the history of the concept of Geus-urva (' Soul-of-the
Cow '), the Iranian primeval Earth-cow, or of the
Iranian primeval Bull, both of whom were slain, like the Mithraic Bui] of the monuments. It is only the
artistic connexion between Babylonia and Persia in
the matter to which I call attention. The Mithraic
Bull is a descendant in art of the Euphratean Bull, as
the Man-bulls of Persia are of the Man-bulls of Nineveh and Babylon.
The Eagle also at times appears on Mithraic monu
ments (Vide Senese, PI. ii.) 5 as do the two Palm-trees, one at each side of the representation (lb.), and which
symbolize the two Groves of the Under-world, one at the far East and the other at the far West. These
two Palm-trees appear on the Cylinder already noticed
which gives the league of the Sun-god and the Moon
god (Sup. p. 52) ; and they are conventionally introduced on a Persian Cylinder (Lajard, M. PI. xxv. 6)
depicting Darayavaush I. lion-hunting. In regions westward the original Palm is often represented by
the pyramidal Cypress and the Poplar. Two such
Cypresses are also shown on the design in question ; and the Poplar meets us in the Homeric Grove of
Persephone (Vide P. B. Jr., K. pp. 106-7), an Aryan
goddess, the analogue of the Euphratean Ninkigal
Allat (Vide sup. p. 39).
Another Mithraic group (Senese, Pt. ii. PL xxxiii.)
gives the Sun and Moon, represented both as human
heads and as stars ; the five Planets, represented as
stars ; and besides the usual figures of Mithra, the
Bull, two Genii, Dog, Scorjiion, and Crow, there are
also shown the Ear-of-corn, Eagle, Arrow, Tortoise,



58 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [x
and Dolphin, of which latter I do not remember a
Euphratean representation. The Thunderbolt, which also is shown, is a familiar Euphratean weapon of Bel in his contest with Tiamat.
Other Mithraic representations show the Bowl
(KavOapo?), close by the Serpent and the Lion (Vide Grand Bas-Kelief de Heddernheim,ap. Cumont, ii. 363),
agreeing with the celestial positions of Hydra, Crater
and Leo (Vide lb. ii. 374, Fig. 283). The Ram also
appears in Mithraic art (lb. p. 428, Fig. 363) and the
Fish (lb. Fig. 366). Another instance (Jos. cle
Hammer, Mithriaca, 1833, PL iii.) shows the Pegasus,
Eagle, Swan, etc. It is therefore sufficiently obvious
that the greater part of the Mithraic imagery is
Euphratean in origin ; and the illustrative examples given in the present chapter will show that Euphratean art, like that of the earlier coin-types, and like the
early unnumismatic art of the Aigaion seaboard and
of Asia Minor, is simply crowded with constellation
subjects.



CHAPTER XL
The Tablet of the Thirty Stars.
Section I. Introductory.
I Tablet W. A. L, V. xlvi. No. 1, from the Birs
Nimroud, written in the Babylonian cuneiform and
copied from an older tablet, is of very great interest
and importance in connexion with archaic astronomy
and stellar mythology. It is divided into three parts.
Part L, lines 1-38, including the obverse and the two
first lines of the reverse, is in two columns, the first
of which gives the names of 31 stars or asterisms, and
the second shows their regent-divinities. Part II.,
lines 39-53, is also divided into two columns, the first
of which gives a further star-list, including also
several planet names, and the second adds some
remarks and explanations. Part III., lines 54-64,
consists of text, not in columns, but in two divisions,
the first of six, and the second of five lines. This
part contains some observations on the position of the
moon during the months Kislev, Tebet, and Sebat.
The first point of special interest in connexion with
the Tablet is that it supplies the list of the 30 stars
spoken of by Diodoros (Vide sup. p. 3). In his account of the Chaldaean celestial scheme, after having
mentioned the planets, he continues :
f Y7ro Se tw
tovtwv (popav Xeyovcri Tera^Oai TpiaKOVTa 'Ao-re^oa?, ovg 7rpoo- ay opevovcrai BouXa/ov? OeoJ? (' And under the orbit
of these [the planets] they say that Thirty Stars,



60 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xi
which they denominate " Divinities of the Council,"
have been marshalled'). As noticed previously, the Chiefs of the Thirty were 12 in number, to each of
whom a sign of the Zodiac was assigned. This last
arrangement was a practical combination of a rough lunar Zodiac, consisting of 30 or 31 moon-stations, with the familiar solar Zodiac. The lunar Zodiac,
moreover, was specially Sumero-Akkadian, for in W. A. I. IV. xv. we read (ap. Sayce) of certain
spirits :
Ak. 'In the watch of the Thirty (Stars) was their office.' Sem. 'In the Signs of the Zodiac was their office.'
So that the sphere of the Thirty Stars was equivalent to that of the Twelve Signs, and the former concept
was Sumero-Akkadian, the latter Semitic, or more Semitic. In a combination of the two divisions and
systems. Twelve of the Thirty necessarily became 'Chiefs.' Although the number 30, as that of the
days of the month, is connected with the moon and
the lunar month of 29 days, 13 hours, yet these 30
stars do not very accurately represent the lunar mansions ; they merely mark out these in a vaguely
approximate manner. From what has been said it
follows, as of course, that the 30 (31) stars of the
Tablet are all either in or comparatively near the
ecliptic. And this fact was clearly seen by that able
Assyriologist the late Geo. Bertin, who first drew my
attention to it, and kindly assisted me in its study.
In the abstract, also, it is highly probable that these 31 stars, inasmuch as they mark the successive steps
of the moon during the month, would be named in the
Tablet in correct celestial order. This circumstance
also is confirmed by its internal examination ; and



Xl] THE TABLET OF THE THIRTY STARS. 6 1
the Tablet therefore supplies highly important material
for a correct reconstruction of a large portion of the
Euphratean celestial sphere. Moreover the 31st and
last star (=also ' Asterism ' or ' Constellation,' as the
case may require) of Part L, that is, of this most
ancient Lunar Zodiac, the parent of all other lunar
zodiacs, is the Goat-fish (Muna-kha), one of the 12 Chiefs of the Thirty, a Sign which, without any doubt
or question =Capricorn. Hence the year indicated by the Tablet commenced in Aquarius, and the 30
Stars must be traced round from Aquarius to
Capricornus. This represents a year which, like the
Boiotian, Delphian, and Bithynian years, commenced
at the winter solstice, a very natural point of begin
ning. Thus, we find that the appearance of the first
full moon after the winter solstice ' is still celebrated
as the chief annual festival of the Dravidians [like the
Sumero-Akkadai, a non-Aryan and non-Semitic race] of southern India, where it marks the beginning of
the year
'
(J. F. Hewitt, Early Hist, of Northern
India, pp. 551-2). A list of Tamil (Dravidian) lunar
and solar-lunar months, given by Mr. Hewitt, is as follows :
Tamil Lunar List. Tamil Solar-lunar List.
1. Tai. 1. Kumbha ('the Watering-pot'). 2. Maussi. 2. Minam (' the Fishes 7
).
3. Panguni. 3. Mesham (' the Ram '). 4. Chittri. 4. Rishabam ('the Bull').
5. Vayasi. 5. Midhunam (' the Twins '). 6. Auni. 6. Kartakam (' the Crab').
7. Audi. 7. Simham ('the Lion').
8. Auvani. 8. Kauni ('the Girl').
9. Purattasi. 9. Tulam ('the Balance').
10. Arpesi. 10. Vrishakam ('the Scorpion'). 11. Kartikai. 11. Dhamsu ('the A rcher').
12. Margali. 12. Makaram ('the Goat-fish').



62 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xi
This order is in exact agreement with that of the
Tablet of the Thirty Stars, a circumstance which
confirms the inference that it was a widespread and
archaic arrangement amongst Turanian nations. The
Signs of the Zodiac reached India through the Greeks
(Vide Vol. I. 17), and duly appear in the Tamil Solar
lunar list ; but they are placed in a- non-solar order,
the Urn of Aquarius first, the Goat-fish last. ' Lunar
chronology,' says Prof. Max Midler, 'seems every
where to have preceded solar chronology
'
{Rig- Veda
Samhitd, Vol. IV., 1892, Preface, p. 67); and the Euphratean Lunar Zodiac, as I have elsewhere shown
(Vide Vol. I. 17) is the source of all other existing
lunar schemes.
The Tablet of the Thirty Stars has been treated at
length by me (30 S. 1890 ; E. S. R., Pt. v. 1895-6),
and more briefly by Prof. Hommel (Astron. der alt.
Chat. Pt. iii., 1892, pp. 15-16). He agrees that it
contains a ' Mondstationenliste,' but supposes that the
list begins with the Pleiades, and that lines 12-26
form an Excursus, relating to the Pole-star, Aries,
Pegasus, Deneb (a Cygni), Cassiepeia, etc. In E. S. R. Pt. v. pp. 6-7 , I criticised this view, but, so
far as I am aware, my arguments have received no
reply. Prof. Hommel's learning and services to the
cause of literature and historic truth are so great that
it would be uncourteous to pass over his opinion in
silence ; and I therefore reproduce here the considera
tions which seem to me to be absolutely fatal to his
theory. These are mainly : I. The testimony of Diodoros, above mentioned, and the argument derived from other schemes, such
as the Tamil List. Of these circumstances Prof.
Hommel takes no notice.



Xl] THE TABLET OP THE THIRTY STARS. 6$
II. If the list ends with the Goat-fish (which he
admits), and the asterisms are mentioned in actual
celestial order (which, except as regards the alleged Excursus, he also admits), how is it possible that the Pleiades could be No. I. ? In this case there would
be no moon-station for the heaven-space occupied by
Aquarius, Pisces and Aries, which is absurd. Bertin,
for some reason, supposed that Asterism No. I., that of
the Foundation? was fi Ceti. Even this view would
leave the Aquarius-space unaccounted for, and /3 Ceti,
a smaller second magnitude star, is a long way from
the ecliptic ; but still this opinion is better than Prof.
Hommel's theory.
III. At first sight Prof. Hommel's explanation of
the leading asterisms of the Tablet seems to be abso
lutely conclusive, i.e.,
' the Foundation '
(=Pleiades), 1 the Jackal '
(=Aldebaran), Gam (=/3 and Tauri), 1 the Great-tivins ' (=Castor and Pollux), the Little
twins '
(=Asellus bor. et aust. in Cancer), and ' the
King '
(=Pegulus). But, unfortunately for this view,
we are informed in 1. 49 that the Ram is saku-sa-risi
kakkabi Gam (' the uppermost part of the asterism
Gam) ; and thus Gain cannot be ft and Tauri, nor
can it come after the Pleiades and Aldebaran, and so
the chain is at once and fatally broken. Moreover, as
noticed (Vol. I. 338), /3 Tauri was 'the northern -light
of the Chariot', and Tauri ' the Southern-light of Chariot (Ak. Gar, Bab. -As. Narkabtu) ; and in
W. A. I. III. lvii. No. 9, 1. 70, the constellation of
the Chariot is distinguished from Gam, which is
named next to it (1. 71). Thus, also from external
evidence, Gam cannot be fi and Tauri. This fatal
error in the scheme makes it unnecessary to examine it
more in detail. I may, however, add that whilst the



64 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS.
Pleiad is undoubtedly a * foundation '
star, it is the
Foundation-star of the solar, not of the lunar, Zodiac,
and, as such, is called Te (Vide sup. p. 16) ; whereas the Foundatio?i-3iSterism of the lunar Zodiac of the
Tablet is not called Te, but, both here and elsewhere,
Apin.
The important piece of information respecting Gam
and the Ram [Aries) given by the scribe, as above noticed, shows that he was well acquainted with two
sets of figures, lunar and solar. The Ram was a solar
constellation, Gam a lunar asterism. It must be
remembered that the solar Zodiac was, if I may so
express it, placed upon the lunar Zodiac, and covered
the same space in uranography. Mr. T. W. Kingsmill,
in an important article, full of learning and suggestive
ness, entitled A Comparative Table of the Lunar Asterisms {Journal of the China Branch of the Koyal
Asiatic Soc, Dec, 1892), observes :
' Notwithstanding the wide extension of the lunar
mansions, which at one time must have been popularly
received from China on the one hand to Greece on the
other, the system cannot have prevailed for many centuries '
(p. 78).
1
If, however, the completion of the series of lunar
stations, and the astronomy to which they gave rise, cannot be dated before 2350 B.C. [?], we find that the system cannot have had more than two centuries of
unchallenged existence. Evidence . . . goes to prove
that when the astronomers of Chaldea adopted the
solar signs, and marked the beginning of the year by
the solar culmination of the constellations, the Pleiades
still occupied the place of honour, marking a date not later than 2150 B.C.' (p. 79). But, whatever may have
been the case in other countries, in the Euphrates



Xl] THE TABLET OF THE THIRTY STARS. 65
Valley the lunar scheme had probably, either solely,
or jointly with the solar scheme, a reign of many centuries. Lacouperie's researches resulted in the
conclusion that amongst other elements of West
Asian civilization acquired by the ancestors of the
Chinese, through their relations with the Euphrates
Valley and Nummaki (Elam), were ' four seasons in the
year, the winter solstice as beginning of the calendar '
(Western Origin of the Early Chinese Civilization, p. 378). Prof. Hommel's error, in my opinion, consists
in treating the lunar, as if it were a solar, scheme,
beginning, naturally enough, in Taurus. It will doubtless be asked, What is the basis for
Prof. Hommel's idea that lines 12-26 of the Tablet
form an Excursus, and refer to stars some of which
are far from the ecliptic ? The answer to this is
briefly as follows: Asterism No. XVIII. is 'the Horse'
and No. XIX. Lu-lim ('the He-goat
' or ' Ibex ') and
these are supposed by Prof. Hommel to represent
Pegasus and Ai'ies. Now the Horse is not necessarily
Pegasus. The heaven is full of duplicates, two Bears,
Wains, Lions, Dogs, Goats, etc. Lulim, again, does
not necessarily mean * ram.' Thus, Prof. Sayce
observes, ' The full name of Saturn was Lubat-sakus,
which is given as a synonyme of Lulim in W. A. I.
II. 48, 52. Now lulim signified both " king " and
"stag" (Trails. Soc. Bib. Archaeol. iii. 169), in
support of which statement he quotes W. A. I. II.
vi. 8, 31, 41 (Vide also Sayce, Pel. Anct. Babs. p. 284). Bertin was inclined to render lulim by '
gazelle,' which
in Ak. is elim ; lulim, according to Prof. Sayce, being
probably ' a re-duplicated form of the same word.' But lu certainly means 'flocks' (of small
cattle, i.e.,
sheep and goats) Sem. tsene, and the meaning 'king' vol. 11. 5



66 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xi
is derived from the idea of the leader of the flock.
We shall see when we c6me to Asterism No. XIX. that
the animal there mentioned is not the zodiacal Earn,
which when referred to in this Tablet (1. 49 ; vide
sup.) is called, not Lulim, but Lu-nit (' Male-sheep '). It would indeed be strange if the scribe having begun
at the Pleiades, and gone on regularly for some time, should suddenly introduce Aries in the middle of his
list. Again, Asterism XXII, Entenamasluv, which is rendered by (Sem.) Siru1 Etsen-tsiri (W. A. I. II. xlix.
47), 'the Limb Tip-of-the-tail/ Prof. Hommel considers
to be Deneb [i.e., Ar. Dzeneb or Zanab, ' the Tail ' of
the Bird), a Cygni. I know of no reason for the
identification except that both are thus connected
with a *
tail,' but not necessarily with the same tail.
And the utter baselessness of this identification well
appears from W. A. I. III. lii. No. 1,1. 17-18, where
we read : Kakkab Lubat ina arakh Diizu innamar. Kakkab Entenamasluv ina atsu-su kakkaba itammikh ('The
planet Jupiter in the month Tammuz is seen. The
asterism Entenamasluv at its rising the planet holds ').
This asterism, therefore, as Jensen (Kosmol. p. 54),
perceived, must be in der Nahe der Ekliptik
'
; and
cannot therefore be the tail of the Swan. Such, then,
is the general character of the Tablet, and such are
some of the principal reasons for not accepting Prof.
Hommel's view of it. I will next give a trans
literation and translation, accompanied by notes, of such parts of it as are connected with the present
enquiry.

1 The Asterism of the Foundation. | The god Sar.'
In deciding upon what stars constituted 'the Asterism
of the Foundation] our choice, as will be observed from
what has been already said, is necessarily restricted to
the region occupied by Aquarius. That Apin was in or near the ecliptic we learn expressly from Tab. S. 375; Kakkab Apin kharran Samsi iksud ('The Asterism of the Foundation the path of the Sun
took '). My late friend Dr. Lacouperie shortly before
his death sent me a corrected list of the Chinese Siuh
(Lunar Mansions) ; and it is remarkable that the 25th
of these is Wei, anciently Gui (Cf. Ak. Gi, ' founda
tion '), and consists of a Aquarii and Pegasi. It is
also to be observed that the Fortuna Maior of Dante,
Chaucer, and other mediaeval writers, consists of the
stars a, y, *], , ir Aquarii and Pegasi ; and it is very
interesting to notice how the later greatness of these
comparatively inconspicuous stars depends upon early Euphratean ideas (Vide R. B. Jr., in the Academy,
Jan. 12, 1895). We have seen (Sup. p. 16) that the
name of the xith zodiacal constellation was Gu, Gula
(' the Urn 9
), and in W. A. I. III. lvii. No. 5, 1. 2 it
is called Gu-si-sa (or -di),
' the Leading
' or '
Directing Urn,' just as the second month of the year, once the
first, is called Gut-si-di (or -sa),
' the Directing-bull.' Such a name points to the Urn having been regarded, at some time and in some way, as the head and first



68 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xi
of the chain of year-asterisms ; just as it appears at the head of the Signs in the Tamil solar-lunar list.
We may consider, then, ' the Asterism of the Founda
tion ' as probably including the stars a, y, , rj 9 0, X
and S Aquarii, with perhaps some others adjoining. In W. A. I. III. liii. No. 1,1. 2 we read Kakkab Apin
ana siri surri (' The Asterism of the Foundation por
tends the foundations of a gate '), a good illustration
of a senseless prognostication based merely on the
name, at a time when the original meaning of the
name had very likely long been forgotten. The regent divinity of the ' Asterism of the Foundation '
is appropriately
' the god Sar,' (Ak.) An-sar, the power of the Upper-expanse, who is named in the Creation
Legend, and whose name * is generally read Assur as
a deity in later times, being an ordinary symbol for the supreme god of the Assyrians

connected with the planet Mars, a fact which appears

[asterism] of the Hyena.' Sayce.). Mars as Numma, Sem. Zibu ('the Wolf) seems related to the Hyena
or Jackal ; and in Anu, the divinity ruling over the
asterism, we are again reminded of Z'albat - Anu
(Mars). In W. A. I. II. xlix. No. 4, 1. 1 the
asterism Likbarra appears in a list with the stars of
the Lion, Dog, etc. The Urbarva, if only by play on words (to which the scribes evidently much in
clined), is the animal appropriate to the Horizon- and
Foundation-god Ur, and hence is suitably placed next to 'the Foundation! As noticed (Sup. p. 35) the
Likbarra appears in Euphratean uranographic art. Jensen (Kosmol. p. 147) makes the curious mistake of
supposing that the line is to be read as an equation,
i.e., Urbarra=Anu. This and his peculiar view about Anu, 'Anu ein Pol des Himmels '
(lb. p. 19), have misled Sir Norman Lockyer, who writes :
' Do we get the jackal in Babylonian astronomy ? . . . Jensen refers to the various readings "jackal" and
"leopard," and states that it is only doubtful whether
by this figure the god ANU or the pole of the Ecliptic
ANU is meant' (The Dawn of Astronomy, p. 362). As I have said elsewhere, 'the theory which makes
"Anu Nordpol d. Ekliptik" and " Bil Nordpol d.
Aequators " is not really borne out by the Inscriptions '
(Academy, March 31, 1894, p. 272); and the
Jackal or Hyena (not
'
Leopard') is neither Anu nor
a planet. Jensen (Kosmol. pp. 120, 524), by a further mistake, identifies the Urbarra with Mercury. As
the reader will observe none of the 30 Stars (aster
isms) are planets ; nor could they be planets, since they form a lunar zodiac. Planets are named after
wards in the next division of the Tablet. There is
no asterism of the Fishes amongst the 30, for Fomal



JO PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xi
liaut seems to have been too far to the south to have
been included ; and Pisces is a dark constellation,
whilst Okda (a Piscium), as we shall see, was in
cluded in* the next asterism. The Urbarra will
therefore consist of , a, and y Pegasi. Pegasus is a
paranatellon of Aquarius and Pisces, and its stars form the 26th and 27th lunar mansions of the
Arabians etc. (Vide E. S. R. Pt. v. 10). The Horse
occurs elsewhere in this Lunar Zodiac (Vide inf. p.
84). It is noticeable that a Jackal appears in the
circular zodiac of Tentyra (Denderah) in a position which would correspond with the stars of Pegasus.
The dog is frequently a point of departure in idea with respect to animal names. Thus, with the
Sumero-Akkadai. as the Hyena is the '
Striped-dog
'
the Wolf is the * Greedy-dog
' and the Lion the '
Bigdog.' So, with the Eskimo, the Polar-bear is the ' White
dog
'
; and, in the Vendiddd {Fargard, xiii), the Hedgehog is ' the Dog with the prickly back.' The Ak.
Likbarra is also rendered by (Sem.) Barbaru, which
is generally translated '
Leopard.' As with respect to colours, so in reference to animals, there is often a
great vagueness of terminology in ancient literature.

lean over").' But the comparison may be greatly extended, and we see here an instance of the advan
tages arising from the identification of Sum.-Ak. as a
member of the great Turanian family of languages. For, when we turn to the Turko-Tataric dialects, we
find at once the root horn, komb, kun, ' round' etc.,
whence the Uigur Kom-av, ' amulet,' i.e., that which
is round ; the Tchagatai kom, ' camel's hump,' kom
bul,
' knob,' etc. As in the Turanian languages m-final
at times changes into n {e.g., kom kun), n into r, and
Jc into j, the Ak. gam and Turko-Tataric horn, komb,
reappear in the Laponic jo-r-ba,
' rotundus,' and the
Magyar gor-be,
* curvus '
(Vide Budenz, Magyar- Ugor Oss. Szotdr, p. 61) ; and so we find the Magyar gomb,
' a sphere,' gomb-olyu, ' round,' the Zyrianian gor
byltny,
' bent,' etc. etc. Gam, therefore, ' the weapon
of Merodakh,' is that which is ' round,' '
bent,' or
' curved,' namely, the saparu, sickle-shaped sword or 'Scimitar,' which 'is always represented both in the
sculptures and inscriptions as a weapon of BelMerodach' (Smith and Sayce, Choi. Ac. Gen, p. 109),
in his war against the dragon Tiamat. As, of course,
this same weapon the khereb-harpe, the '
portentous sickle
'
(TreKwpiov apirriv. Hes. Theog. 179) with which the solar Kronos assails Ouranos, is employed by the
solar Barsav-Perseus in his fight with the Sea
monster, the reduplication of Tiamat. Again, Gamgam is the Ak. name of the Ostrich, As. Sakatuv,
which ' may be compared with the Arabic saka, "abiit, declicavit, deflexit a via recta," and may allude to the
well-known habit of these birds of always vanning in circles when hunted '
(Kev. Wm. Houghton, in Trans.
S. B. A. viii. 101). Gam-gam (i.e., Gam intensive),= ' the Circler,'=the Ostrich. Whether this weapon of



J 2 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xi
the solar Merodakh is the lightning or the crescent
moon is immaterial to our present purpose. It is
here reduplicated in an Asterism ; and, as noticed
(Sup. p. 63),
* the uppermost part
' of this Asterism
is the Ram. This most important statement locates
Gam beyond a doubt. Its ' uppermost part
' is there
fore a, /3, and y Arietis, which thus form the handle
of the Scimitar, the blade of which will extend south
wards to Ohda (' the Knot/ a Piscium). The weapon is thus suspended just over the head of the Sea
monster, its handle not being very far from Perseus.
In this connexion we observe further that two lists of
asterisms, solar and lunar, were familiar to the scribe
who inserted glosses in the latter part of the Tablet.
He thus carefully points out the connexion between
the lunar asterism of the Scimitar, which does not
appear in the solar list, and the solar asterism of the
Ram, which does not appear in the lunar list. A
Kakkah Gam is mentioned in W. A. I. III. lvii. No.
6, line 4 and in No. 9, Front, 1. 12. These two Gams
are not necessarily identical with each other, or with
the Asterism of this Tablet. There may be two
Scimitars (Cf. the Sickle in Leo), just as two Bears,
Dogs, Twins, etc.

heavens. The Great Twins of the solar Zodiac are
Castor and Pollux, but here we traverse the same
region, the ecliptic, from a different starting-point ; and as we know exactly where we have now reached,
i.e., immediately to the east of Aries, we have no difficulty in recognizing the Great Twins of the lunar
Zodiac as the two famous asterisms of the Pleiads and
Hyads, or, perhaps, more strictly, of the Pleiad (Vide Vol. I. 57, 134) and Aldebaran ('The Follower' of
the Pleiad), the pair Te-Te (Vide sup. p. 14), so
constantly coupled by the classic writers, from the nXiyiaJa? 0' 'YdSag of the Iliad downwards. In
W. A. I. III. lvii. No. 7, Rev. 1. 5-6, Lugal-nerra
and Gallamta are explained as Guttav {Jupiter) and
Zalbat [Mars). In K. 2407 Lugal-nerra is represented as asking the gods to solve a riddle. Jupiter
is thus patron-planet of the Hyads and the red Mars
of the red star Aldebaran. The Moon-god is also
appropriately the patron-divinity of both, that is of the peculiarly lunar constellation Taurus. Nergal,
otherwise Nirwal ('the Great -hero') lord of the
Under-world and god of the planet Mars, is also
naturally a patron-divinity of this nocturnal Sign, specially connected with Mars. Nergal, the Death
god, called ' Nergal of the Apparitions
'
(W. A. I. III.
lxvii. 70), was also patron-divinity of the Ak. town
Gudua (' the Resting-place '), Sem. Kutu, where was
a famous necropolis. Hence, 'the men of Kuth,'
when transplanted into the land of Israel, still ' made
Nergal

thrown upon the Tablet of the Thirty Stars by the
seven existing Lunar Zodiacs, namely, the Persian,
Sogdian, Khorasmian, Chinese, Indian, Arab and Coptic schemes, all of which are derived from it. In
each of these arrangements of the heavens these three
small stars of Oridn follow the Pleiads and Hyads as
the next lunar mansion (Vide E. S. R. v. 16). They
are situate so close together that (p
1 is overlapped by A, and they thus form a pair of little twins immedi
ately in line with the Great-twins. The Ox-of-day is
primarily the Sun (Merodakh. Vide Sayce, Eel. Anet.
Bobs. p. 106), and is then reduplicated in the planetary Merodakh (Jupiter). The simile is the sun
ploughing the ecliptic-path. The Lady-of-rising is the planetary Istar- Venus. Jupiter and Venus are
thus the two patron-planets of the Little-tivins.

In W. A. I. III. liii. No. 2, 1. 11 we find that

Dhabitu (Tebet) was Lugal (' The Mighty-man '), otherwise Un-gal (' Man ' + '

Xl] THE TABLET OF THE THIRTY STARS. 75
(' King '). Now the Tablet of the Thirty Stars has
some special connexion with the three particular months Kislimu, Dhabitu and Sabadhu ; and here,
accordingly, we find Merodakh the ruling-divinity of the Asterism of the Mighty-man or King. The name
Mighty-man is practically repeated in numerous later names of the constellation Oridn ; and the Asterism
in question will be either Betelgeuse (a Orionis) alone, or with some other portion of Orion. Lacouperie
observes that Orion appears as a *
military chief alike
in Babylonia and China' {Western Origin, p. 340). In the General Sphere Lugal, as noticed, was the
name of Herakles (Sup. p. 10), and Regulus also is
the King-star (Vol. I. 62).

Prof. Hommel says,

'
(Die Astron. der alt. Choi.

clue. But there is little real uncertainty when once
the proper order has been obtained. The Asterism
in question consists of r\, \l, v, y, Geminorum, situate
in the Milky Way ; and the Canal-of-water, called by the Egyptians ' the inaccessible Stream '
(Book of
the Dead, cap. xcviii.), primarily refers to the Galaxy. I do not in this Section refer to the derivative lunar
schemes, which are all treated in detail in E. S. R.
Pt. v. I would merely remind the reader that in
most cases, as in the present instance, they throw great light backwards and illustrate the explanations



J 6 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xi
of the Sum.-Ak. Lunar Mansions here given. The
ruling-divinity of the Canal is the Fire-god, so fre
quently identified, as here, with the Sun-god (For
the reading samsu, vide W. A. I. II. xxxi. 83A).
The name of the Ak. Fire-god Kibir, Sum. Gibil,
Givil, Mongolian ghel (' fire '), according to Lenormant,
reappears in the name of the Emperor Ela,-gabal-us.

to a myth also found subsequently in many variant

had crossed the Canal or Stream of the Milky Way,
which separates him from his brother the Great-dog.
Hence Proeyon, who thus crossed before-the-Dog\ is

of the close connexion between the Sum.-Ak. and the
Turko-Tataric languages. The Bab. translation pre

vents any possibility of doubt respecting its meaning ; and Sapa is at once seen to be akin to the Turko
Tataric root sub, suv, su, * water,' '
lustre,'
' honour,'
Uigur sub, '
lustre,' etc. This Asterism will be Castor
and Pollux (a and ft Geminorum), the Great-twins of
the solar Zodiac. Supa is mentioned in K. 6507 and
in K. 12,690.
Asterism No. X.
12. Kakkab Gu-sir-kes-da Hi Anim, \ Rab-u sa sam-e rabL
' The Asterism Yoke-of-the-enclosure of-the-god Arm, prince of the great heaven.' According to Prof. Hommel, at this point in the Tablet we enter on an ' Excursus,' and the scene, for
some reason unknown, is suddenly shifted to the
North Pole. This Asterism, the name of which he
reads as ' Musir-sar-da, (sprich Musir-sadda)
' or
' Musir-kisda,' is, he states, the ' Grossen Gott
Anu des Himmels,' the ' Joch des Himmels,' the
*
Nord-pol,' and the Pole-star, which cir. B.C. 3000 was
a Draconis [Die Astron. der alt. dial. iii. 1,5). So,
again, Stern mu-sir-sadda (Nord polar-stern) Gott Anu' (lb. 12). In W. A. I. V. xviii. 24 Gusir
kesda is explained as Ni-ru sa sam-e (' the Yoke-of
heaven ') ; and in lb. V. xlvi. 47, as Niru rakisu
(' Yoke-binding '). In lb. II. xlvii. 16, which is
practically a quotation from the present passage, it is
styled, similarly,
' the Yoke-of-the-enclosure' Hi Anirti [a genitive, with the mimmation] rab-u sa sam-e (' of Anu, prince of heaven '). It is thus clear that neither
the ' Yoke,' nor the ' Enclosure,' is Anu ; but they
are said to belong to him, nor can we easily imagine how any single star could well be described as a



78 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xi
*
yoke.' Nor, in all this, is there anything about the North Pole or the Pole-star ; but, on the contrary, as
Prof. Sayce observes, ' the ecliptic was termed " the
yoke of heaven " '
(Eel. And. Bobs. p. 48), an idea
perfectly natural and comprehensible. Thus Aldebaran was technically called Pidnu (' the Yoke '), in
archaic Chinese Pit, the ecliptic being regarded as a
yoke laid across heaven, and its name being techni
cally transferred to its first great star. That kescla
means * enclosure '
(Vide Eel. And. Babs. p. 154,
n. 1) further appears from the Ak. Jchas,
' to cut,'
'
division,' and the Turko-Tat. root kes, kec,
' to cut,'
1 to cut up,'
'
small,'
' narrow,' i.e., that which is cut
up or cut off; whence such words as the Tchagatai
kes-ek, '
apiece.' Hence, too, the Kirgish kes-u, '
lot,'
'
destiny,' i.e., that which is cut off for and appointed
to anyone (Vide Vdmb^ry, Etymol. p. 98). This also explains why the common Crane was called in Ak.
Kesda, i.e., on account of its sonorous and (supposed)
fatidical voice.
That the name Yoke-of-the -enclosure (=primarily
the ecliptic) should be applied with a secondary reference, to the stars of Cancer, is both natural and
appropriate, (l) because Cancer has always been
regarded as a beginning or highest gate of the ecliptic ; and (2) because there are no particular stars in this,
' the Dark Constellation,' to suggest at first sight a special stellar name. As noticed (Sup. p. 15), Allab
(=Cancer) is explained as '
Voice-of-the-Snn-place,' i.e., the ecliptic; and the 4th antediluvian king, who
is equated with Pollux just at the beginning of Cancer is Umun-an (' Girdle-of-heaven.' Vide Vol. I.
333). The Yoke appears with other lunar zodiacal emblems on the monuments : and the stars which com

pose this Astcrism are y, 8, rj, 6 and ^drurj Cancri. The name of 'Yoke' was connected with the Crab
even in Classic times. Thus Manilius :

rubbing two sticks one against the other. The fire
stick, therefore, whose point was ignited by the
friction, was regarded with special veneration. The
idea of " fire " was expressed by two ideographs (GIS-BAR and GIS-SIR) which signified literally
" the wood of light." This " wood of lio;ht
" was exalted
into a god' (Eel. Anct. Babs. pp. 180-1), sometimes
identified with Gibil, the fire-god, sometimes adored
separately under the name of Saval, Sem. Savullu,
Heb. Shaool, Eng. Saul. The ideograph bar repre

sents the two sticks laid across each other ; and the
combination read phonetically Gisbar represents, as Bertin has observed, a ' kind of weapon, or disk, which
was thrown at the enemy.' In a Hymn to Merodakh
the god Anu is made to exclaim :
' In my right hand the god who binds the hosts of the firmament
I .bear.
The Sun-god of fifty faces, the falchion which proclaims me as Anu I bear.'
(TT. A. I. II. xix. No. 2, Eev. 1. 8, 10, ap. Sayce.)
The sun is the original disk hurled at darkness by
the heaven-power. But, further, another partly circular weapon of the Heaven -power and of the Sun-god
in the great contest against chaos and darkness is the
Bow, called in W. A. I. II. xxxix. 31 Gisme, and
explained as the Sem. qastu. This bow is the lunar
crescent. A third weapon is the lightning, and the
' god Gisbar 7
is explained as Bil-gi (=Gi-bil), the
Fire-god (Vide Briinnow, Class. List, p. 95), one of
whose potencies is the lightning. We have here,
then, some curved, disk-like weapon of the Lightpowers, reduplicated in an asterism ; and the faithful
stars present us readily enough with an answer in the
shape of n, y, , /m, e, ^ Leonis, known with a Leon, as the
Sickle, in which, again, we have a reduplication of the
'
sickle-shaped
' sword of Merodakh-Perseus. Mulmo

Asterism, was afterwards a solar dawn-god, and sub
sequently
' the Lord of the Zenith ' (Mat same, ' the
height of heaven '), and, technically, the zenith itself.

Prof. Sayce renders Gubarra ' Fire-flame,' and
observes that the Sum. Gubarra is an older form of
the Ak. Mubarra, and that the form Gisbar (Sup.
p. 79) shows that the original name was Gusbarra ;
gus, 'the sky,' gus, 'fire,' and gus-qin, 'the yellow metal' (gold) being connected words. Kibir-ra and
Gibil are ' dialectal forms of Gubarra.' With gus
compare the Uigur ids, kiz,
'

Tchagatai kizi,
' warm,' the Kazan kisil,

Kirgish kizil,

'

Gisbar, so the K. Gubbara may be expected to be
closely connected with the K. Gisbar, and is Regulus

The customary rendering of lamina, lamas, Sem.
lamassu, is *

etymology, and merely a paraphrase, the lamassi being the colossal statues at the entrance of temples,
personifications of the propitious guardian Genii of the place. But lamas is translated by the scribe ' the
burning-of-fire
'
; and we are able to prove the correct
ness of his rendering by comparison with the corre
sponding words in certain dialects connected, though
distantly, with the Sum.-Ak. Lam, Lamma, lamas =
the Magyar lang (=Lat. flamma ignis), Finnic loimu, 'strong-flame/ loimua, ' to flame.' The Turko-Tatar
dialects do not employ an initial I, but replace it hyj.
Thus, the Magyar lelek,
' soul,'=Osmanli jel,
' wind,'
Ostiak Ijil,
' ghost,'=Sum.-Ak. HI, 'ghost,' whence As. lildtu, Heb. lileth. Hence, a Sum.-Ak. lam, lav,
becomes in Turko-Tat. jav, jar, jal,
' to gleam,'
' burn,'
'flame,' etc., e.g., Tchagatai jalau, 'flame.' The
Lamassi, therefore, are ' the Burning-ones

; and the
name is equivalent to the Heb. Seraphim, who have been incorrectly explained by certain modern writers

as dragons (Vide Goldziher, Mythology among the Hebs. p. 197). Baku, the Bohu of Gen. i. 2, the
Phoenician Baau, ' the Void,' was the equivalent of
the Ak. Gurra ('the Watery-deep'), and was called
(Ak.) Gula. The first ruling-divinity of the Asterism
is of great interest. I have said that the principal
stars are also called gods, and the Ak. Ur- or Lik-makh
(lit.
'
Great-dog '), in Sem. form Urmakhu or Urmakh
khuy =th.Q Lik-gula (Vide sup. p. 16), i.e., the Lion, who thus appears as the ruler of this Asterism, which
will be Denebola (=Ar. Zanab-al-asad, ' the-Tail-of
the-Lion '), ft Leonis. Here, then, we find the zodiacal
Leo unmistakably connected with this point in the
Tablet, a circumstance which adds another conclusive
proof of the correctness of the principle employed in
its explanation. The connexion in idea between Fire
and the Lion, and between the Lion and * the hottest
pathways of the sun' (H. D. 149), I have often had
occasion to notice.

explain with certainty, is '
evidently the same as
Istar' (Pinches). Thus, Ninsar (practically )=Akh
bitum. The ruling-divinities, as frequently, are reduplicated in the star-group, which will consist of

Daonos, the 6th antediluvian king, Dun (=Dannu),
'the Hero,' or 'Mighty-one,' is equated with Spica (Vide Vol. I. 66). The Eg. name of the star, Repa (' the Lord,' ' Governor '), is somewhat similar in
signification.

where we read ' That star [true to its name] for mist
and tempest is

(Sayce). There is thus a close con
nexion between the lunar Zodiac asterism of the

' The Asterism Lord-of-the-foundation-of-brickwork. | The god the Creator.'
This Asterism is also called Entemasmur (W. A. L.
III. lvii. No. 6, 1. 55), and the name refers to the
famous Ziggurat or ' terraced tower ' of Babel-Babylon,
the original Altar-tower of the 7th or Libra month
(Vide sap. p. 25). Masluv=A$. apparrii, Heb. OpJior
(' Clay,'
' Morter '). As a lunar Asterism Entenamasluv
=20 Librae and the stars adjoining (Vide R. B. Jr.,
30 Stars, pp. 32-3) ; but it is also a constellation, and, as such =Hydra, wholly or in part. The connexion between the famous Tower, Babylon, and the autumnal
season, the 7th month, explains the position of this Asterism at the base of the Constellation Chelai
Libra ; and further light is thrown upon the matter
by the name of the 16th Chinese lunar asterism, con
sisting of a, /3, y, Librae, and the archaic name of which is L-shi (' the Foundation '). Entenamasluv
was called (Sem.) Siru-etsen-tsiri ( W. A. L. II. xlix. 47),
1 the Limb Tip-of-the-Tail/ This is not a translation
of the Ak. name, but an explanation of the position of the Asterism, as being at the end of the tail of



Xl] THE TABLET OF THE THIRTY STARS. Sj
Hydra. As Jensen saw, it must be ' in der Nahe der
Ekliptik
'
(Kosmol. p. 54), and cannot be the tail of
the Great Bear, or of the Swan (Hommel), nor, again,
is it the tail of the Lion (Hommel), Antares (Bertin),
or Aldebaran (Oppert). This double or triple aspect
of Entenamasluv gives rise to various statements
concerning it which, except under most careful in
vestigation, appear to be contradictory. Thus, we are told- that in the month Tammuz, with which it is
specially connected, at its rising it raises the waves of
the sea' (W. A. I. III. lvii. No. 1, 1. 12). This idea
is connected with Hydra, as ' the strong serpent of
the sea* (lb. II. xix. No. 2, Ob. 1. 8). As an ecliptic
asterism it 'holds' Jupiter (lb. III. lii. No. 1, 1.
17-18) ; and is particularly connected with Tisri, the 7th month (Tab. 81-1-6, 102). Its connexion with
Tammuz, the 4th month, is illustrated by the fact that,
as Hydra, it extends right up to Cancer (=Allab.
Vide W. A. L III. liii. No. 1, 1. 74). The patron
divinity of this Asterism is the god Ip.
'
Ip and
Nin-ip were two primaeval deities who in Accadian
kosmology represented the male and female principles, but the genderless character of the Accadian Nin,
" lord " or " lady," caused the Semites to change NIN
IP into a god and identify him with IP, that is "Anu
who listens to prayer

pomorphically regarded, gave rise to myths of battle

This mansion consists of Antares (Cor Scorpionis),
which is represented as a stellar reduplication of the
god Lugal-tudda (Vide Sem. pp. 74-7) ; and the lord of seed in the 7th month (Sept. -Oct.). To understand
these complicated allusions the reader must remem
ber that the 7th month was originally represented by an Altar, often circular (=the solar photosphere)
grasped by the Claws of the Scorpion (Vide Vol. I. 67 et seq.). The original golden seed of heaven is the
Sun, which, as in various mythologies, is seized and swallowed by the darkness in monstrous and dracontic
form. This is the primary meaning ; and it is in the
month Tisri that the waning autumn Sun begins to



Xl] THE TABLET OF THE THIRTY STARS. 89
succumb to his foes. There may, or may not, be also
a secondary reference to agricultural operations ; but these do not form the basis of archaic symbolism,
inasmuch as man's observation of nature long pre
ceded any regular agricultural course. Lugal-tudda, Sem. Zu, was also the thief and god of the lightning,
and the giver of fire to man ; and the ideograph gir,
pictorially representing
'
blade,'
'
sting,' or '
pointed
tail,' means ' to strike,'
'
scorpion,'
* plough/ and
'
lightning,'
' the torment of a scorpion, when he
striketh a man '
(Apoc. ix. 5) being compared with the burning of lightning. The Zu-bird is the ' divine
Storm-bird,' and, as we have seen (Vol. I. 333) Antares is equated with the 7th antediluvian King
Euedoranchos (' Day-heaven-bird ').

(

ghost- world ') and Nin-ge (' Queen of the Under
world'), the '
Great-region,' being Scheol-Hades. I
have noticed (Sup. p. 39) a representation of Ninkigal snake in hand. As Gladstone has pointed out
(Horn. Synchronism., p. 235), Ninkigal possesses the prominence and dread character of the Homeric Perse
phoneia, a phase and aspect which the latter goddess has borrowed from her eastern sister. As noticed
(Vol. I. 104-5), the Ak. Okeanos is sometimes com
pared to a snake ; and the * Eiver of the Snake ' is
also called ' the Eiver of the Sheepcote of the Ghost
world,' a line of thought which connects the Snake
with the Under- world and its goddess-mistress. But
the Snake has so many aspects in the thought of early man, beneficial and honoured, as well as malignant and dreaded, that it is not surprising to find various
and highly different divinities connected with it.
The 'Prophet' is Nebo, the 'King' Merodakh, and the ' Exalted '-one the Air-god (Ak.) Mermer.

The Asterism consists of 9, t, k, X and v Scorpionis.
Iskhara is a name of Istar (W. A. I. II. xlix. 14), ap
parently when, like Ea, in a piscine form and character
(Jcha means 'fish'), as a Derketo (Vide Sem. p. 102). The Classical writers were acquainted with a myth to
this effect which, I think, has not yet been discovered
in the monuments. Thus Hyginus connects Pisces
with the Euphrates, giving a legend that Venus (=Istar, Derketo) and Cupid took the form of fishes
in that river. ' Venerem cum filio in flumen se proie
cisse, et ibi flguram piscium forma mutasse '
(De Sig. xxx. ; vide Vol. I. 115).
Bertin thought that Sar-ur might mean ' Leader
of-the-Dog,' in which case the name may contain a
reference to the setting of Cams Maj. after the advent
of Scorpio (Vide 30 Stars, pp. 38-9). These divinities
are star-gods (Vide inf. p. 140).
Asterism No. XXVIII.
33. Kakkab Ligbat, ilu Ku-su. \ Liu Kur-gal.
' The Asterism Beast-of-death ; the god Sunset, god

Urbat, which he calls the Jackal, is Antares (Astron.
der alt. dial. iii. 16). Such a conjecture is merely a
guess ; and, as we have seen (Sup. pp. 7, 23), Ligbat is no part of Scorpio. This Asterism consists of a, /3,
y, S Lupi. The Wolf, called in As. Akiluv ('the
Devourer'), is very generally a type of Darkness which swallows up things ; and the ruling- divinity of this creature of night and death is Kush (Vide K.
10,038), an Ak. god of sunset and night, and hence a god of the Under- world or '
Great-country.'

| Ndhru Mas-gu-gar u ndhru Ud-hip-nun-na. ' The Asterism of the Great-goddess and the aster
ism of the Swallow. | The river the Current and the
river Light -of-the-great-plain' The Ak. divinity Antina (~An-nuna, 'the Great
god') of Sippara was made by the Semites into the
female Anunit (' Great-goddess '), and identified with
Istar. She is described by Nabunahid (Nabonidos) as
' the mistress of battle, the bearer of the bow and
quiver, . . . who made omens favourable at sunrise
and sunset' (Vide Sayce, Rel. Anct. Babs. pp. 182-4) ;
and this represents her in a planetary phase, as Venus, * star of the morn and eve.' But she is further re
duplicated in a stellar form as the Star of the Tigris,
the Current being the '
rapidus Tigris.' In W. A. I. II. li. 58 ' the Star of the river Masgugar
'
is explained as ' the goddess Anunitum.'
The Asterism in question will be X, p Sagittarii

to which they are respectively dedicated. A Bird, which may be the Swallow, appears with other lunar zodiacal figures on the monuments. The annual
migrations of the Swallow connect it alike with
destiny (as a prophetic bird), and with the autumn (Sagittarius) season. The river Udkip-nu7ina=ihe

Sagittarii, which form a * yoke
' thrown across the
ecliptic near the commencement of the great Sea
extending thence to Aries (Vide Vol. I. 84). Gusir
abba is identified with Nunki, pronounced Nunpe,
according to Tab. 82-8-16, 1 Ob. 21, and referring to the city of Eridu, a most ancient centre of the Ea
cult, and once ' at the mouth of the Euphrates and on
the edge of the Persian Gulf (Sayce, Rel. And.
Babs. p. 135), and thus a 'Yoke of the Sea.' Hence
the role of Gusirabba as the patron asterism of the
seaport town of Eridu. The ecliptic thus appears as a
' Yoke ' at Cancer (Sup. p. 77) and at Capricorn.

'The Asterism Ship-of-the-bond, i.e., the asterism

the Hero-voice-of-fear.' Here, as in No. XXX. we see that a star, asterism
or constellation had frequently more than one, and
often even many, names. This asterism is of course
Capricorn, which thus indubitably marks the end of
the Lunar Zodiac. The other name for it Makhar or



94 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xi
Magur, and which I have compared with Makara,
the Indian name for Capricorn (30 Stars, p. 13),
appears to mean Ship-of-the-rope, the Okeanos-stream being at times compared to a rope wound round the
earth (Vide Sayce, Rel. Anct. Bobs. p. 116). The old Ak. rope-god Innina became connected in idea
with Nabu (Nebo. lb. p. 117) ; and thus Nabu is the
first patron-divinity of the Asterism, the second being
apparently a Thunder-god, whose name would, also mean ' the Lion- voice-of- fear,' the roaring of the lion
being naturally connected with the sound of thunder. The god Urmetum is also mentioned in K. 1273. The
Goat, it may be remarked, is a figure frequently connected with storm (Vide Vol. I. 218); and the 10th
month, that of Capricorn,
' was stormy and wet '
(Sayce, in Trans. S. B. A. iii. 164).
We have now made the circle of the Lunar Zodiac,
and reached the end of the first part of the Tablet.
As previously stated, great light is thrown back upon it by the lists of the 7 derivative and daughter
schemes (Vide E. S. R. V.), which it is not my
purpose to treat of here. The foregoing identifica
tions make no pretence to mathematical accuracy in all
respects ; but, as a whole, they speak for themselves. The learned reader will be well aware of the immense
difficulties of the task. As the Greeks did not adopt
a lunar zodiac, the great majority of these asterisms
are unknown in the West ; but we observe amongst
them some constellations with which we are already
familiar, namely, Pallika or Palura (=Procyon),
Mulu-bat (=Serpentarius), Tsir (=Serpens), Girtab (=Sco7yio), Ligbat (=Lupus), and Munahha (=
Capricorn). Other familiar names appear differently applied. Such are Mastallagalgal, Lugal, Ansu



Xl] THE TABLET OF THE THIRTY STARS. 95
Kurra, Tsir, and Lulim, which are bestowed on one
set of stars in the Lunar Zodiac, and on another in
the general Euphratean Planisphere. Imdugudkhu
(Vide sup. p. 17) appears as a god, not as a constellation ; and a circumstance such as this, coupled with
many other similar indications, tend to show that a
higher antiquity is to be attributed to this Lunar
Zodiac than to the Solar Zodiac as we have it. The
lunar list presents us with a series of highly archaic
Sum.-Ak. asterism-names ; and, very ancient as the
Tablet is, it was compiled by Sem. scribes from a lore
then long since grey-headed, and their glosses and
attempts at explanation frequently reveal quite an
inadequate understanding of the system as a whole.
SUB-SECTION II. A FURTHER LIST OF STAR- NAMES.
The scribe having completed the list of asterisms
forming the Lunar Zodiac with their patron-divini
ties, next proceeds to add a supplementary list of
stars. It is impossible to detect any definite principle
in this latter compilation. It includes planets, some
stars which had been previously named, and some
which had not ; but it is neither a zodiacal nor an
extra-zodiacal list. The names are accompanied by
certain explanations, which doubtless imported much
more to the Babylonians than they do to ourselves.

Sirius and Procyon (Vide inf. pp. 120-31). Prayers are addressed to Kaksisa, as a male divinity (Vide

IOO PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xi
On the 15th days of these months, sun and moon were
not seen together ; on the 30th days they were seen
together. These three lines are quoted in the great Bab. work
on astronomy (Vide W. A. I. III. lxi. No. 2, 1.
23-4) ; and therefore the Tablet of the Thirty Stars
is older than the former compilation. The passage in
the Enu Bill immediately before the quotation is of
great interest, and enables us to some extent to
determine the age of the work. It reads : ' The Umman-Manda comes and governs the land.
The mercy-seats of the great gods are taken away. Bel goes to Elam. It is prophesied that after 30
years the exiles shall be restored, (and that) the great gods shall return with them '
(Ap. Sayce). The labours and discoveries of Prof. Sayce, Prof.
Hommel and Mr. Pinches have at length enabled us
to understand this passage. The Umman-Manda
('Tribal hordes.' L. W. King.) dwelt in the land of
Nod {Gen. iv. 16. I.e., of the ' Nomads '), and in the
days of the early greatness of Nummaki (Elam) were amongst its vassals. They joined in the capture and plundering of Babilu by the Elamite king Kudurnankhundi l
; and their king Tudkhula, the Tid'al, king of the Goyyim (' Barbarians '), of Gen. xiv., was
an ally of the Elamite Kudar-Lagamar (Chedorlaomer) in his western campaign against Sedom (Sodom). The reign of Khammurabi, the Amraphel of Gen. xiv.,2 is placed by Bertin (Bab. Chron. and Hist.
1 The goddess Nakhundi is mentioned in K. 11255.
2 A reviewer of Sem., and one who, to use an expression of Mr.
Lang's, is evidently a ' camp-follower ' of the ' Higher Criticism,' is extremely angry because I notice (pp. 94-6) the doleful effect upon the general system of Wellhausen of the remarkable dis

p. 39) from B.C. 2259 to 2214 ; but by Hommel
(And. Heb. Trad. p. 125), with greater probability, B.C. 1947-1892. The terrible events connected with
the capture of Babilu and the carrying off of the
statue of the god Bel by the Barbarians are evidently
fresh in the mind of the writer of this portion of the
finu Bili. The god's statue is naturally taken by
the Elamite conquerors to their own country ; but the
reverses inflicted on Babilu were subsequently fully
avenged by Khammurabi, who overthrew Kudar
lagamar, and evidently recovered, amongst other things, certain statues of goddesses which had been
carried off (Vide Hommel, And. Heb. Trad. pp.
1 78-9). Without entering here further into historical
and other connected questions, it is plain from the
foregoing instance, not to speak of the general
covery, from the cuneiform records, that Gen. xiv. is a strictly
historical narrative. He remarks, rudely enough, that my observations are ' singularly silly,' a tone which shows the depth of his
own annoyance. What is really '
singularly silly
' is the standpoint of Wellhausen and his school in the matter. He himself still asserts that the incidents recorded in Gen. xiv. ' are sheer
impossibilities
'
(Vide Hommel, And. Heb. Trad. p. 200), which, on the face of it, is an unprovable statement. Other critics of the school, unable to disprove the accuracy of such names as
Kudur-Lagamar, Eri-Aku (Arioch), etc., have hastened arbitrarily to invent the ridiculous theory that some post-exilic Jew, who, for some unknown purpose, desired to write a historical romance, searched the Bab. archives, found the names in question, and then,
' for some reason,' says Meyer, c which ive are unable to fathom
[They can't even suggest a reason to bolster up the preposterous
notion.], mixes up Abraham with the history of Kudur-Lagamar ' (Vide lb. p. 162). All this kind of nonsense is humbly reproduced ad nauseam in manuals and text-books by certain English devotees of the Wellhausen School, and is spoken of, as if, like the fall of the image of Artemis from heaven, it could not be doubted
for an instant.



T02 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xi
evidence, that the $nu Bili is of very high antiquity ; and consequently that the Tablet of the Thirty Stars
must belong at least to the third millennium B.C.
Speaking of lines 57-64 an eminent Assyriologist
recently expressed the opinion to me that it would be long ere we could translate them. It is, however,
desirable to make a beginning ; and I therefore append
the following : 57. Kakhab a-na mes-khu izarr-ikh : na-mas (/?) a-dam-ma-a kunnunu. Duppu.

creatures are probably included.
Adamd. The ' Black ' race (Cf. the Aithiopians of
Poseidon-Ea), used in a general sense for mankind.
Prof. Sayce, having observed that the *

' of the expression
' the black-headed race,'
' which
is frequent in the hymns, is uncertain,' adds :
' As M. Dieulafoy's excavations on the site of Susa
have brought to light enamelled bricks of the Elamite
period on which a black race of mankind is portrayed,
it may mean that the primitive Sumerian population of Chaldaea was really black-skinned' (Rel. Anct.
Bobs. p. 99, n. 4). Line 57 is probably some quotation from an archaic
hymn which told, in simple language, how at night,
during the sway of the moon, man and other animals
are wont to rest. It rather reminds us of K. 2836, a
' hymn composed by order of Assur-bani-pal on the occasion of an eclipse of the moon,' in which ' man
kind are called " the people of the black heads, the

'

This region appears to be the ecliptic. We now
reach the last portion of the Tablet, 1. 60-4. A
thicker line than ordinary divides lines 59 and 60,
and this indicates the commencement of a new phase
of the subject. It would perhaps be premature to
attempt a detailed translation, as various ideographs may be read in several different ways. But the
general sense is that the foregoing Tablet, which is said to be connected with the ecliptic (' yoke '), was
also connected with, and was probably deposited in E-zi-da ana ilu Nabu, rub nuri (' the Firmly-estab
lished-temple for Nebo, lord of light '). Nabu, ' the creator of the written tablet,'
' the maker of writing,'
patron-divinity of Barsipki (Borsippa), had there a famous temple called Ezida (' the Eternal-house.'
Maspero, Dawn of Civ. p. 675) ; and he had also a
1 chapel
' of the same name in the great temple of
Merodakh at Babilu. Tablets were placed for safe
keeping in ' the inner chamber of Ezida' (Vide Sayce,
Rel. A?ict. Babs. p. 520), the library being under the

particular protection of the god of learning. Both Ezidas were splendidly restored by Nabukudurra
utsur III. But the Bab. '
temples were miniature
reproductions of the arrangement of the universe.
The " ziggurat
"
represented in its form the moun
tain of the world '
(Maspero, Dcnvn of Civ. p. 674).
The ziggurrdt (' temple-tower ') of Nabu at Barsipki was called ' the House of the Seven Bonds of heaven
and earth,' and was in 7 stages, severally painted with the different planetary colours (Vide Sayce, Rel. Anct.
Bobs. p. 115). These 7 planetary bonds combine in
forming the bond or yoke of the ecliptic ; they make the zodiac, solar and lunar. And the true and original
Ezida is the * Eternal- house ' where the bright lights
oo of heaven fulfil their deathless destiny.
An As. Cylinder of great interest (Figured in Smith
and Sayce, Choi. Ac. Gen. p. 112) exactly illustrates
the circling lunar course. At each end, i.e., in east
and west, is a Palm-tree, representative of the Grove of the Under- world, eastern and western, and redupli
cated in the Homeric aXcrea Uepo-efovelrjs (Od. x. 509 ;
vide K. B. Jr., K. pp. 106-7). Next to the eastern
Palm-tree, on the back of a Leopard, which, as it could be trained to hunt, was a fit symbol for the
Hunter-sun, stands the Sun-god Merodakh, armed with bow and arrow and the saparu (sickle-shaped
weapon, vide sup. p. 71), and lifting his right hand in solemn oath. Above his head is the solar star,
which explains the symbolism. In front of him
stands the unarmed Moon-god, also lifting his right
hand in oath ; for the two are making a solemn
covenant to preserve kosmic order against the demons
of darkness and storm. Behind the Moon-god, and
standing on their hind legs, are two Unicorn-goats,



Xl] THE TABLET OF THE THIRTY STARS. IO5
counter-salient, with their heads regardant ; and, in
the air, between them and the Moon-god, is the lunar
crescent, the key to the symbolism, and divided into
three parts, illustrative of the three parts of the
month and the triple lunar aspect (Vide R. B. Jr., U.), by what seem to be handles. The Unicorn, or any
animal represented with one horn only, is, as I have
shown, a lunar symbol ; and the remarkable position
of the two Unicorn -goats counter-salient, clearly
indicates the monthly cycling progress of the moon 'there and back.' Such, then, is the general scope and import of the Tablet of the Thirty Stars.



CHAPTER XII.
Some Stellar Groups of Sevens.
Section I. The Tiksi-Tikpi Stars.
The importance and sanctity so frequently attached by man to the number seven is a feeling reflected
from the heavens themselves. There roll the Seven
Wanderers, constant objects of curiosity, reverence and dread. There shine in sevens the stars of the
two polar Chariots, of Orion, and of the Pleiad, But, distinct from these, the early inhabitants of the
Euphrates Valley had grouped together certain other stars in sevens ; and in Tab. W.A.I. III. Ivii. No. 6,
in addition to the seven Planets and the seven phases
of Mars, we have the seven Tiksi, the seven Lu-mdsi,
and the seven Mdsi.
The TSsi-stars also occur in W. A. I. II. xlix.
10-13, where they are called Tikpi. Tik-si appears to me to be a Sum.-Ak. name meaning '
Those-lyingin-front '
(tik). Tikpi is not, I think, a variant form ; but a Sem. word suggested by the form of the Sum.
Ak. name, and meaning '
strong
'
(Cf. Heb. Touqeph, Dan. xi. 17). Prof. Hommel compares the '
syrisch
tekaph, " stark, machtig sein " '
(Astron. der alt. Choi.
iii. 12). Jensen (Kosmol. p. 57) abandons in despair
all attempts to explain the name or to identify the Tikpi-st&rs. In a research so difficult we should not,
to use an expression of Prof. Max Muller's, * clamour for mathematical accuracy
'
; nor, on the other hand,



XIl] SOME STELLAR GROUPS OF SEVENS. IO7
need we give up the investigation as hopeless. The names of the seven Tiksi-staxs, several of which can
be read in different ways, as the ideographs have
various phonetic renderings, are as follows: (1)
Gam ; (2) Lugal, Sem. Sar ; (3) Khu-sin, otherwise
Khu-sibain; (4) Katsir-nindM or Gumnsh-ni-nagi
(Hommel) ; (5) Gis-li-e, gis being here probably a
determinative prefix, primarily meaning ' tree ' or * wood,' and hence denoting some wooden object or
article; (6) Tsir ; and (7) Bildara (Pinches), other
wise Nidar (Hommel) or Issi (Sayce). Prof.
Hommel has endeavoured to identify these seven
stars, and in two instances I have arrived at the same
conclusions. We both regard the King {Lugal) as
being Regulus, and the Bird (Khu) as Corvus.
There is not the least reason to think that Herakles,
a constellation also called Lugal (Vide sup. p. 10) is
intended ; nor is there any other Bird except Corvus
in this part of the heavens. These identifications
determine, to a considerable extent, the celestial
locality in question. We may expect to find the
Tiksi star-group in the neighbourhood of Leo, near the centre of the ecliptic, and thus in the front of
the heaven. The Ak. word Sibain, evidently mean
ing some sort of bird, is curiously like the Mongol
Schiabon, Schowoon, Buriat Subung, which has the meaning of ' bird '
generally. The first of the seven Tiksi-st&vs, Gam, Prof.
Hommel identifies with f$ and Tauri (Vide sup.
p. 63). As we have seen, the Gam of the Tablet of
the Thirty Stars cannot be any part of the Bull ; and
Prof. Hommel regards the two Gams (' Scimitars ') as
identical. This, however, I think, is clearly not the case. The Gam of the lunar Zodiac=a, /3, y Arietis



108 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xil
and a Piscium, stars which are out of the questioi
here. Gam is the ' circular ' ' weapon of Merodakh '
(Vide sup. p. 71), and the Gam of the Tiksi-st&rs
will be identical with Gisbar (Vide sup. p. 79),
1 which is before Mulmosarra,'=' in the front ' of the
heavens, i.e., rj, yf , m, and X Leonis, which, with
Regulus, form ' the Sickle,' a stellar reduplication of
the circular weapon of the Sun-god. Thus Gam and
Lugal lie together. The third Tiksi-st&r is Corvus, and the fourth,
Katsir-nindke (' The Mouth-of-the-Snake-drinks '),=
Caput Hydrae, the allusion apparently being to the head of the Water-snake as near the ' canal ' of the
Milky Way. Prof. Hommel doubtfully identifies
this star with Spica.
The fifth Tiksi-stsiY is Gis-Li-e, which Prof. Hommel
calls * " Stern des Mnstrumentes," das ist wahrschein
lich des Joches (bzw. der Wage).' I do not, how
ever, think that any stars in Libra are intended. The
Ak. li=Sem. lilisu (Sayce, Syl. No. 61), and the Rev.
C. J. Ball {A Bab. Ritual Text, in the Journal of
the Royal Asiatic Soc. 1892, p. 849) observes, 'The
Accadian liliz appears in As. as lilisu. The general
sense of our text requires that it should mean some
kind of vessel or receiver.' And, having instanced
several cases in which lis ' seems to denote a vessel,' he
adds that ' the Chinese li is " a tripod or incense
caldron,"
'
concluding,
'
Perhaps the lilis was a " brazen
laver." I therefore conclude, on the whole, that the
Li-e-sta,r=Crater.
The sixth Tiksi-st&x is Tsir (' the Serpent ') which,
according to Prof. Hommel, =a Serpentis. But it is quite needless to go so far afield when there
is a suitable star comparatively close at hand,



XIl] SOME STELLAR GROUPS OF SEVENS. IO9
i.e., Alphard, Ak. Alia (Vide Vol. I. 360; sup.
p. 79). The seventh Tiksi-st&r is Bildara, which Prof.
Hommel- supposes is /3 and S Scorpionis, because we
read in W.A.I. 111. liii. 28, Ilu Iz-si 1
(the same cuneiform combination as Bildara) kaklcab Gir-tab
qa-bi,
' The god the Fiery-one, the constellation of the
Scorpion addresses.' The fact is that this same
cuneiform combination is applied both to a planet
and to a fixed star. In the former case I think with
Prof. Sayce, that the name is to be read Izsi ; in the
latter case I would read Bildara, with Mr. Pinches.
Thus, in K. 2894, Ob. 1. 4 we read, Kakkab Gir-tab
ilu Iz-si yub-bu-ur,
' The constellation of the Scorpion
the god the Fiery-one crossed.' Here Izsi must be a
planet, and we may have an instance of the close
connexion between Scorpio and Mars (Vide Vol. I.
73). Line 5 states, Ilu Iz-si yu-ta-ma-al, ' The god
the Fiery-one goes slowly.' Here, again, the observation refers to a planet, not to a fixed star ; and in
each of these three instances Izsi is called, not kakkab,
but ilu (' the god '), which here implies a planet, as distinguished from fixed stars. But there are no planets amongst the Tiksi, Lu-mdsi and Mdsi. The Tiksi
star Bildara (' White-fire ') is therefore a fixed star ;
and the remaining remarkable star near at hand is
Denebola, which, as we have seen (Sup. p. 83) is
called ' the Burning-of-fire,' and which, moreover, like
Polaris, Regulus and Fomalhaut, is a ' white ' star.
1 As a god-name, this cuneiform combination, whatever may be
its correct transliteration, is applied to Ninip, who is specially connected with the planet Kronos-Saturn ; to Nabu, who is specially connected with Mercury ; and to Sin (the Moon. Vide Briinnow,
Class. List, p. 202).



IIO PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xil
Thus we locate the seven Tiksi-Tikpi stars under
the Bear, in the front of the heaven and near each
other ; three in the Lion, and the other four in the
Water-snake and its closely associated constellations
the Bowl and the Crow.
Section II. The Lu-masi Stars.
After the Tiksi-staYs the Tab. W. A. I. III. IviL
No. 6 gives the seven Lu-masi stars. In Sum.-Ak.
lu= sheep,' mas, Sem. mdsu,=( hero '
; and just as
the planets were styled
* seven Old Sheep,' so seven
particular fixed stars (I use the word ' star ' in the
usual wide general sense) were known as ' the Sheep
of the Hero,' i.e., the Sun (Vide Sayce, Bel. Anct.
Bobs. p. 49). As Prof. Sayce observes, 'Jensen has
shown that mdsi in this combination was further used
in the sense of "twins," the stars composing the " lu
masi "
being grouped as twins. It is an example of the obliteration of the original signification of an
epithet by a secondary one. " The sheep of the hero," the Accadian lu-mas, became the Semitic lu-mthi,
" the twin oxen," lu being an Assyrian word for " ox "
(lb. n. 1). Thus, the stars are regarded as a flock of
sheep, which the Sun drives before him ; or, again, as
oxen, some of which plough the ecliptic. So, similarly, would the western Aryan churl, looking up to the
ChurVs (=Charles') Wain, view its stars as the
Septem Triones (' the Seven Draggers ') or oxen. The
names of the seven Lu-mdsi-sta,rs are as follows :
(l) Sugi or Shugi ; (2) Udgudua, otherwise Udkagaba ; (3) Sibzianna ; (4) Kaksidi, otherwise Kaksisa
or Dasisa ; (5) Entemasagar or Entemasluv, other



XIl] SOME STELLAR GROUPS OF SEVENS. Ill
wise In-tinnina-bar-shigga (Hommel) ; (6) Idkhu, Iru or Eri-gu ; and (7) Papilsak or Pabilsag. I will first notice the conclusion at which Jensen
(Kosmol.) and Hommel (Astron. der alt. dial.) have arrived at respecting the Lu-mdsi ; and although
here, as on some other occasions, I may have reason
to differ from these illustrious scholars on various
points, it must not be supposed that I do not
entertain deep respect for their great achieve
ments.
As regards Sugi, Udgudua, Entemasluv and Idkhu, Jensen contents himself with observing that they are
all in the neighbourhood of the ecliptic' With respect
to the first three I agree. We have seen (Vol. I. 78 ;
sup. p. 5) that Udgudua, in its broader significa
tion,=Sagittarius ; and when regarded with Papilmk as forming one of a pair of twins, probably=e and or Sag., whilst Papilsak, in this latter connexion, prob
ably=X and m Sag. (Vide sup. p. 25). Jensen
suggests (P. 538) that Papilsak may be the Archer,
and Hommel observes of the '
Pa-bil-sag-Stern,'
' etwa
mit Mira ceti im Walfisch oder aber mit einem zwischen
6 Ophiuchi und ir des Schiitzen zu suchenden Stern
zu identifizieren ist '
(Astron. iii. 12). As I place
Papilsak between Ophiuchi and 7r Sagittarii, there
is a practical agreement respecting it. Why Hommel should suggest that Papilsak may possibly be o Ceti,
called Mira ('the Wondrous') 'on account of its
remarkable variation in brilliance,' I am not aware.
As we have seen (Sup. p. 15) Papilsak was an ecliptic star of the 9th month. Hommel places
' Ud
ka-gaba' (=Udgudua), which he renders 'Throat
opening-beast,' either in the region of Lepus, or in
the comparatively starless space occupied by the



I I 2 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [x]
modern constellation the Unicorn, between the two
Dogs. Here, again, the question is decided by Tab. Sm. 162 (Sup. p. 5), so that nothing more need be
added.
Entemasluv, in full Entenamasluv, Hommel arbi
trarily splits in two. When it is spoken of as an
ecliptic star he regards it as Denebola (Vide sup. p. 87) ; at other times he supposes it to be Deneb (i.e.,
Zanab, ' the Tail,' a Cygui). In the abstract there
may be two stars of this name, just as there are many
other celestial duplicates. But such a fact is not to
be assumed ; a priori the probability is against it (As to this *
star,' vide sup. p. 86). Idkhu, as we have
seen (Vol. I. 45 ; Sup. p. 18) is Aquila with its Eagle-star Altair. To this Hommel agrees, but, as noticed, Jensen places Idkhu 'in der Nahe der
Ekliptik.' His reason for this view is probably based
upon such passages as the following (W. A. I. III. lii.
No. 2) :
14. Kakkab Id-khu ana kakkab Lu-bat dikhu:
' The constellation the Eagle to the planet Jupiter
(is) opposite
' :
17. Kakkab Id-khu ina libbi Sini nazuz :
' The constellation the Eagle over the place of the
Moon is fixed.
18. The constellation the Eagle over the right horn
(ina qarni imni) of the Moon is fixed.
19. The constellation the Eagle over the left horn
(ina qarni sumeli) of the Moon is fixed.'
The preposition ina has the meanings 'in/ 'upon,'
'
near,' etc. (Vide Muss-Arnolt, As. Diet. p. 66) ; and,
in the above passage is obviously to be rendered
' over,' inasmuch as no bright star is ever seen actually
impaled, so to speak, upon a horn of the moon (Vide



XIl] SOME STELLAR GROUPS OF SEVENS. 11$
R. B. Jr., E. S. R. Part i. 17). I have often noticed
Luna and Altair in the exact combination referred to
in 1. 18. The Ak. lib, Sem. libbu, means * within,'
' the middle,' and ' the heart,' as that which is in ' the
midst ' of the body. But the phrase ina libbi has one
or more special astronomical meanings. Thus, a star
is said to be ina lib-su (Tab. K. 2310, Rev. 1. 14),
'in its (own) place,' i.e., its proper place in the heavenly array, in accordance with kosmic harmony
and order. Again, in W. A.I. III. liii. No. 1, 1. 18,
we read Guttav ina libbi izzaz (' Jupiter in the midst
is fixed ') ; and elsewhere (Vide Vol. I. 269) it is
stated 'the star Tiranna (' Judge - of - heaven, '=
Polaris) over-against (i.e., opposite to, itti) the midst is bound.' Here, the Pole-star, whatever star may
then have been Polaris, is represented as being fixed immovably, opposite to ' the midst ' of the heavens.
It is possible that (Ak.) ki here=ma, and that the
Pole-star may be regarded as also a heaven-centre ;
but from such passages it is sufficiently clear that, as a
rule, 'the midst '=the ecliptic ; and this interpretation,
which is in itself sufficiently obvious, is confirmed when
we turn to Aratos, who, speaking of the Ram, says :
1 In midst of the vast heaven he moves, just where The Cto-tips and Orldrfs head revolve '
(H. D. 231-2).
' Just where ' means in the same division of the
heaven, i.e., the ecliptic; and the Bab. ina libbi=the
Gk. lULea-a-oOt. But, further, 'the midst' may also
mean, not the ecliptic generally, but some particular
portion of it, the special subject of observation at the
time. Thus in K. 2310, Rev. 1. 3, where Sagittarius
is under observation, we read Lu-bat an-a libbi dikhu
(' The planet \Jupiter~] to the midst is opposite.' This VOL. II. 8



114 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xil
does not mean that Jupiter, like Polaris, is * over
against' the midst; but that he was opposite to that part of the ecliptic which being then under special con
sideration, was, for the time, 'the midst' par excellence.
According to Hommel, Shugi=Orion. He states that the Sum. Shugi=Sem. Shibu, ' Shaykh
'
(lit.
1 Elder '), that it reappears in the Eg. Sech l (=0rion), and that the word Shibu, meaning Orion, occurs in
W. A.L III. liii. No. 1, 1. 71. In W. A. I. II. xxxii.
62 we find Sugi explained as (amongst other things) Sebu (Vide Briinnow, Class. List, p. 300). He draws a further argument from a Tablet 'aus dem Jahr 138
v. Chr.,' which speaks of the stars ' Shugi und Kak
ban ! (Sirius) ; and, from a consideration of their
risings and settings, concludes that the former must
be Orion. The statements of the Tablet do not
appear to me to be conclusive on this point (Vide
quotations from other Tablets respecting Sugi inf. ) ; but we will first examine the passage in W. A. I. III.
liii. No. 1, which is of great interest and importance.
The translation here given is based on that by Prof.
Sayce {Trans. S. B. A. iii. 191) ; and, as I understand
it, the Tablet reads as follows :
71. Kakkab Eritu
'The constellation the Pregnant- woman (is that) sa ina birit kakkab Si-bi u
which in conjunction- with the-star Double-eye and kakkab A-nim izu-zu.
the-constellation of- Ami is-fixed.'
Then follows the important gloss, already quoted (Vol. I. 54), 'the constellation of Anu=the Ram.'
In commenting on the astronomical Tablets we must always remember that most of them are still unknown
1 Sahu is the ordinary Eg. name for the constellation Orion.

to us ; and therefore on many points we have to
speak subject to correction. The present passage supplies an apt illustration of this fact. For some
reason unknown to me Prof. Hommel identifies Eritu
(probably A ma in Ak., vide sup. p. 23), a name of Istar, with the Pleiad. To this I do not agree, because (1) I
know of no evidence in support of the theory ; and (2)
there is nothing to show that Eritu was in the ecliptic,
whilst (3) we already know several (other) names for
the Pleiad. Again, Sibi is not a Sem. word Sebu,
meaning ' Shaykh/ but a Sum. word meaning, as
the ideographs show, ' Eye + two '=' Double-eye,' a curious appellation which receives an exact explana
tion from the characteristics of the singular and
neighbouring star Algol (Vide sup. p. 22). The name Sibi is not contained in a gloss, and when the
tablet- writer has occasion to refer to Sugi, as in 1. 74,
he calls it Sugi, not Sibi or Sebu. That Sibi=Algol
is not capable of anything like mathematical demon
stration ; here, as everywhere, probability is the guide of life. It will be instructive to continue the
translation of the Tablet :
72. Kakkab Ma-a-su sa ina-pdn
1 The constellation the Twins (is that) which before D.P. 1 A-nim izu-zu.
Anu is-fixed.'
Gloss : Anuv kakkab Al-lul, ' Anu (extends to)
the constellation the Hero, '=the Crab (Vide sup.
p. 16). First let us see how Prof. Hommel explains this
line. According to him Anu=the North Pole
('Nordpol'), so that the Twins 'before Anu' are
probably
' die beiden helleren Sterne des Kleinen
1 I.e., Determinative Prefix, viz. ilu (' god ').



Il6 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS.
Baren (die " zwei Kalbchen " der Araber),' that is
and 7 Ursae Min., Ar. El-fer-kadain ('the Two
Calves.' Vide inf. p. 188). Lastly,
' hier ist Anu der
Stern Allul (sonst Delphin).' This last remark of the
'Glossator' anent Anu and Allul, Hommel observes
we are not now able to understand. Most true. On
these lines the changes and transformations of Anu
are indeed incomprehensible. One moment he is the
North Pole, the next he is the Dolphin, and what
next he may be it is impossible even to conjecture.
Vainly also may it be asked, If Anu be the North
Pole, why is the Ram his special constellation ?
Why the Dolphin is introduced I cannot imagine ;
but his appearance is useful, as it enables us to dis
prove Hommel's theory, for, as we have seen (Sup.
p. 16), Allul, otherwise Allah, is not the Dolphin, but is an ecliptic constellation of the fourth month ,=
Cancer. There is no real difficulty in the passage,
and Prof. Hommel has himself helped us to under
stand it. Prof. Sayce remarks, ' Prof. Hommel has
lately shown (Ausland, Nos. 4-7, 1892) that the
spheres of the three " great gods," Anu, Bel and Ea, into which the Chaldaeans divided the sky, corre
sponded to thirds of the Ecliptic, the sphere of Anu extending to the Crab. . . . The Twin -stars were
"the Great Twins," Castor and Pollux in Gemini'
(The Higher Grit, and the Mons. n. pp. 69-70). Thus
we see that Anu=the sphere or special region of
Anu,=a region from the Ram to the Crab, both
inclusive, having the ecliptic as its centre. Hence
the Ram, at the beginning of this region, is the special constellation of Anu ; and hence the note of
the glossator respecting Anu and Allul. ' The Twins
before Anu = Castor and Pollux (a and /5 Gem.);



XIl] SOME STELLAR GROUPS OF SEVENS. 117
and we can leave the North Pole, the Two Calves and
the Dolphin in peace. 73. Kakkab Eritu sa
' The constellation the Pregnant - woman which
ina-pdn Bil si-id rukh sadi si-kid, a-na

the constellation the Chariot-yoke speaks.' Mylitta (=the constellation Addmdth-Andro
meda), which fronts Ursa Maj., which latter is above
the Bel-sphere of the ecliptic, is opposite (=' speaks ')
to Sugi. The Ak. (Gis) Gar- su-gi
' is translated " the
front part of a chariot " '
(Sayce, in Trans. S. B. A. iii.
173, n. 2), and Mr. Pinches renders Sugi by ' Chariot
yoke,' a meaning which, for several reasons, I follow.
Now in K. 2894 Ob. 1. 15 we read : Kakkab Su-gi
tarbatsa. . . . Sin ina libbi kakkabi Su-gi tarbatsa
ipakhkhir. * The constellation the Chariot-yoke sets.
The Moon in the place of the constellation of the
Chariot - yoke sets '
(lit.
' disappearance makes '). Again, in W. A. I. III. Ivii. No. 4, 1. 11, we read :
Dil-bat ina-pdn ilu Su-gi izzaz. ' Venus before the
god the Chariot-yoke is fixed.' Again, in lb. III. lix.
No. 10, 1. 1-2, we read : Kakkab Su-gi ana subti
Sini . . . -va illak ana libbi. Sin erib. ' The con
stellation the Chariot-yoke to the seat of the Moon
. . . and goes to the midst. The Moon sets.' In the
face of such statements as these how can Sugi=
Orion?. The Moon could not set in Orion. It is
true that Orion adjoins the ecliptic, and, according to the boundaries of constellations in our modern star
maps, a small fraction of the constellation is actually
within the ecliptic, but none of its bright stars are so
situate. Taking the evidence as a whole, it seems



Il8 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xil
impossible that Sugi can=(5rftm, at all events in early times ; for, we must remember, that, in the course of ages, the same names were applied in more
than one instance to different planets, and the same
incident may also have taken place in the case of
some of the fixed stars. But further : we have not to
go far afield to find suitable stars for Sugi, an ecliptic
constellation, as Jensen note3 (Sup. p. 1 1 1). It is very probable that the original Taurus consisted of the
Hyads only (Vide Houghton, in Trans. S. B. A. vi.
469) ; and even in Ptolemy's List the star fi Tauri,
called Nath (=Ar. Al-ndtih, ' the Butting'), is said to be ' in the right foot of the Charioteer '
(Vol. I. 55).
Hence it is named (Ar.) Kabdhi-l-indn (' The Heel
of-the-Kein-holder '). Sugi, the ' Chariot-yoke
' or
*
Front-part-of-a-chariot,' will thus probably = the southern stars of Auriga, which extend into the
ecliptic ; and the somewhat singular expression ilu
Sugi (Sup. p. 117), 'the god' (not kakkab) Sugi, or
' the god of the Chariot-yoke,
1 will refer to the
divinity originally represented by Auriga (As to the ecliptic Chariot, vide Vol. I. 338). This view also
explains the remarkable connexion between Sugi and
the Moon above noticed ; not merely because the
Moon could be in Sugi as an ecliptic constellation, but also because of the connexion between the Moon, the
New Year and Capella, the principal star of Auriga
(Vide Map, Vol. I. 119). In considering 1. 73-4. Hommel is compelled to assume that there is a second
constellation called the Pregnant-woman, a circum
stance in the abstract very improbable. He also holds Entenamasluv to be Deneb (a Cygni. Vide
sup. p. 112); and, as in 1. 74 we read: Kakkab
Entenamasluv kakkab Allah, a gloss which, on his



XIl] SOME STELLAR GROUPS OF SEVENS. II9
principles (Vide sup. p. 115), he is compelled to
interpret,
' Entenamasluv=Allab '
{=Allul) y we are landed in the dilemma Deneb=the Dolphin (Vide
sup. p. 116), which is absurd. I interpret this useful gloss as I did the former one (1. 72) ;
' Entena
masluv (=Hydra) extends to Allah 1
(=Cancer).
In the passage W.A.I. III. liii. No. 1, 1. 71-4,
therefore, the scribe appears to be considering the
Anu-portion of the heavens, and to refer to
Andromeda (Eritu), Algol (Sibi), Aries (Lulim), Cancer (Allul, otherwise Allah), Auriga south
(Sugi), Castor and Pollux (Mdsu), and Hydra
(Entenamasluv). The two remaining Lu-masi stars are Kaksidi and
Sihzianna. Both are protagonists of the heavenly
host, and both have already occasioned a great amount
of controversy. Jensen holds that Kaksidi=Antares, and that Sihzianna=Regulus, The positive evidence in favour of this theory is nil, the negative over
whelming. Thus, although the references to Kaksidi
are very numerous, not one of them speaks of it as an
ecliptic star ; and, as we have seen (Sup. p. 98 ), it
does not appear in the list of lunar Mansions, but, on
the contrary, is mentioned in the second part of the
Tablet of the Thirty Stars. This circumstance, how
ever, is not absolutely conclusive that Kaksidi is not
another name for Palura (=Procyon) i but even
Procyon is not really within the ecliptic, although a loose and ill-defined ecliptic included it. Regulus,
again, is not called Sihzianna, but, as we know positively from Classical sources (Vide Vol. I. 62)
was named Lu-gal (Sem.) Sarru, ' the King/ Nor,
again, was Sihzianna merely a single star (Vide Vol. I. 288). I will now proceed to consider Kaksidi,



120 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xil
which, as observed (Sup. p. 98), is either Sirius or
Procyon. First, as to the names Kak-sidi and Kak-ban.
In certain 6k. -Bab. tablets mention is made of a star
which Epping and Strassmaier call Kak-ban, and
which, by astronomical calculation, they identify with
Sirius. Jensen and Hommel agree, and let it be
admitted. I would, however, observe that kak being
the construct state of the Sem. kakku (' weapon'), we
ought to read the second syllable not (Ak.) ban
(' bow '), but (Sem.) qasti (' of-the-bow '). Thus the
Kakkab Kak- qasti is ' the star Weapon- of-the-boiv,' the '
Bogenstern.' Further, I am not aware that this name occurs in any early tablet ; it seems to be a late
and purely Sem. title of Sirius. Here, of course, I
speak subject to correction. In Z. (p. 26) I made a
suggestion respecting the name Kak-ban which I think worthy of mention here. I pointed out that
the ideograph for kak is at times rendered in As. by
kal (Vide Sayce, Syl. No. 138), and that ban also
appears as bam, that in Bab. -As. m and v are inter
changeable, as frequently are u and v (Vide Sayce, As. Gram. pp. 46-7). The result of this is that
instead of kak-ban it is possible that we ought to read
kal-bav, kal-bau, kal-bu, * dog/ i.e., Sirius. However, be this as it may, let us assume so far that
Bow-star was a late Bab. name for Sirius. We now
turn to the name Kak-sidi. In Sum.-Ak. the
North (=our N.W.), the point of the compass specially connected with Akkad (Vide K. 8484), was
called Mer-sidi (' the Directing-point '), just as the Bull, once leader of the Signs, was called Gut-sidi
('the Directing-bull '). As Sirius is south of Procyon, and as the latter has been styled
' the Northern



XIl] SOME STELLAR GROUPS OF SEVENS. 12 1
Sirias,' and as kak in Kak-qasti means ' weapon/ it has been assumed that in Kak-sidi we have ' Weapon
northern,' * Waffe des Nordens,' as Hommel styles Procyon. On this view Sirias and Procyon were
two Weapon-stars. Sirius the Bow, Procyon some unnamed weapon, a rather singular circumstance.
There are, however, certain rather grave difficulties
in the way of this view of the meaning of the name
Kaksidi. First, Kaksidi is a very ancient Sum.-Ak.
name. Hence, kak, which can also be read ru and
du, has here nothing to do with the Sem. kakku
(' weapon '), but is an Ak. word meaning ' to make '
etc. The Ak. for weapon is gudhu. Next, sidi does
not mean ' north/ but '
directing
'
; and hence Mr.
Pinches wrote to me upon this star-name as follows :
' Du-sisa is rendered in As. as kakkab mesre, but
what this means is difficult to say. Mesritu (plu.)
means " limbs," understood as " leaders " or " direc
tors " (eseru, " to direct "). The Ak. da-sisa [other
wise Kaksidi] means " (the star) which makes
directing."
' Hence, this star-name, whether read one
way or the other, means, not the Northern-weapon, but the Leader (Vide sup. p. 98). Of course such
a title as the Leader naturally reminds us of Sirius,
brightest and chief of the fixed stars, and who, in the
Persian scheme, so closely connected with the Baby
lonian, occupied this position. Thus Plutarch :
'Qpo/uLafyg . . . ovpavov a&Tpois eKo'cr/x^o-ey, eW (T acrrepa
7rpo 7iravTwv oiov (pvXaKa kcu irpooirTviv eyKarecrTrjcre, tov
Xelpiov (Peri Is. xlvii.). Next, so far as I am aware, it is to be observed that just as the name Kak-qasti
only occurs in late documents, so the name Kaksidi
only occurs in ancient documents ; K 260, 1 as quoted
1 Only a portion of K. 260 is given in W. A. I. II. xlix. No. 3,



122 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xil
by Jensen (Kosmol. pp. 49, 52) may be a possible
exception to this, and there, although Jensen strongly denies it, the two stars appear to be
identified.
Kaksisa (the form of the name which I prefer) was
one of ' the twelve stars of the West ' (W. A. I. II.
xlix. 4), amongst which were Dilgan (Capella),
Bartabba-galgal (Castor and Pollux), Sugi, Lugal (Regulus) and Allul (Cancer). Kaksisa rose ' in
the days of variable storms (and) heat,' and was
Mike bronze' (lb. I. xxviii. 14). In W.A.I. II.
xlix. 15 we read : Kakkab Kak-si-sa. Asar rob sami :
1 The star the Leader. |
Station great of-the-heaven : damaku.
prosperous.' Asru, as noticed (Sup. p. 99), is a technical term
applied to special and important celestial localities, e.g., to the lunar Mansions. In the Proc. S. B. A.
March 1888, Dr. Bezold published what he called
' A New Text concerning the Star Kak-si-di! This
Tablet, K. 2894, Ob., a translation of which I gave in
the Proc. S. B. A. May, 1893, was not specially about
Kaksisa, which is not mentioned until 1. 18. We
read :
18. Kakkab Kak-si-sa ana rukhi iltdni
' The star the Leader for a north wind innamiru-su sak-nu :
its-appearance makes :
where Kaksidi (1. 47) is explained, if the reading be correct, as (Sem.) Suhunu, which I would compare with the Heb. ShekMn, an 'inflamed ulcer or boil,' a simile which might be applied to a
brightly blazing star. But another reading is Sukudu, * the Rest
less,' i.e., eager, impetuous blazing.

Tab. K 2310, Ob. contains some similar lines.
Akhamis (lit.
' Like-brothers ') is here used of time,
not of space. The Sesame, associated in legend with
Schamir, Sassafras (=Saxifrage), etc. is a plant which
plays a prominent part in mythic tales, and in original idea is connected with the lightning (Vide Sir G. W.
Cox, Myihol. of the Aryan Nations, 2nd edit. pp. 95,
440 et seq.). When we analyse the evidence con
tained in the foregoing quotations, we shall find that
it seems, on the whole, to point strongly towards Sirius. But not with absolute conclusiveness. Thus
Kaksisa is ' like bronze '
(ertl), and, agreeably with
this, Ptolemy styles Sirius viroKippo^ (Vide Vol. I. 98).
But at present Sirius, as Mr. H. Sadler observes, is ' one of the whitest stars in the heavens '
; and Prof.
Schjellerup has suggested that ' the attribution of the
colour in question to Sirius arises from the error of a
copyist.' This, again, is easy to suggest, but by no



124 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xil
means very probable. Why should a copyist insert
vicoKippos here apropos of nothing ? Sir Norman
Lockyer {Element. Les. in Astron. p. 23) gives the colours of certain large stars,
' founded on Mr.
Ennis's observations/ The ' red stars ' are Aldebaran,
Antares and Betelgeuse ; and each of these are (rightly)
marked v-n-oKippog (' reddish-yellow ') in Ptolemy's List.
Sirius, Vega, Atair (' the Eagle '), and Deneb are said to be '
green stars '
; but this is doubtless the
result of careful astronomical observation. They do
not appear
'
green
' to the naked eye. Thus, I have
no hesitation in calling Vega, as we see it, steel-blue
(Vide Vol. I. 35). Procyon, Capella, Rigel, Bellatrix and Spica are said to be ' blue stars '
; and
Regulus, Denebola, Fomalhaut and Polaris, ' white
stars.' Arcturus, as anyone may see, is, par excel
lence, the '
yellow
' star. Smyth states,
* Mr. Barker,
in the fifty-first volume of the Philosophical Transactions, considered that Sirius has changed colour,
from red to white, in the lapse of ages ; and quotes
Aratus, Cicero, Virgil, Ovid, Seneca, Horace, and
Ptolemy, in proof. The ancients, however, used the names of colours with the utmost latitude.' As a
rule, this last remark is very just.
' Mr. Barker's
evidence for the mutation has more learning than
point ; but Seneca has an admission that the redness
of Sirius was so strong as to exceed that of Mars ; and
Ptolemy says it was the same colour as Cor Scorpii.
These witnesses [are] both men of character and
trust' (Cycle of Celest. Objects, ii. 160). Smyth also
correctly adds that Ptolemy styles Arcturus and
Pollux v-n-oiappos,
' as they now actually are.' These
stars are, on the whole, of the same colour as Chal
kiope (' the Bronze-faced '
Moon) who, in Gk. myth



XIl] SOME STELLAR GROUPS OF SEVENS. I 25
ology, is the spouse of Phrixos (the Unsunlit
air). Thus, we are unable to arrive at certitude
by means of colour-description ; and perhaps
the expression
* like bronze ' is merely used in a
general way of a star glittering and shining as if burnished.
But Kaksisa is also specially connected with the
West, the North Wind, the month Tammuz (June
July) and the star the Eagle (=Altair, a Aquilae. Vide Vol. I. 45). Kaksisa, then, is a star of the
west (Sup. p. 122), and, remembering that the Euphratean W. is the S.W., this is perfectly true of Sirius,
which with us is a S.E. (=Euph. S.) star in January,
a S. (=Euph. S.W.) star in February and March, and a S.W. star in April. The Tablet referred to broadly
divides 24 stars into ' Stars of Akkad '
(=E. and N.), and 'Stars of the West' (=W. and S.). But
these positions practically apply equally well to
Procyon. Kaksisa is further specially connected with June
and July, and is said to rise ' in the days of storms
(and) heat.' Its rising at daybreak (i.e., its heliacal rising) is connected with the commencement of a
north wind ; and the heliacal rising of Sirius in con
nexion with various ancient religious observances is
familiar. The final formal Euphratean scheme or
chart of the heavens had been compiled prior to B.C.
2000 ; and, to take a particular date, on July 10, B.C.
2000, Sirius, as seen from Babylon, rose heliacally
and was only visible shortly before sunrise. It is
a commonplace in the Classics that the fiopem
irqa-iai, the aquilones etesiae, the 'periodical' N.W.
(=Euphratean N.) winds blow for so many
clays from the rising of Sirius. Aratos, speaking



126 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xil
of the days of the Lion, the sign of the month Duzu,
says :
1 These are the hottest pathways of the sun '
;
the * days of heat ' of the Tablet,
* On the wide sea then fall with sudden force
Whistling Etesian blasts.
Then do broad ships best suit the deep, and then May helmsmen keep the rudder to the wind.'
(H. D. 149, 152-5.)
These are the * days of storms ' of the Tablet, and
Kaksisa, the Star of July, reminds us of the Homeric
' Star of Summer that above all others glitters bright
[Sirius is far brighter than Canopus, the second in splendour of the starry host], when he hath bathed in
the Ocean-stream.' So Aratos says of Cants Major :
' His portentous jaw Bears at the end a star which scorches most,
Eesplendent ; so men it the Scorcher call.
When he, growth-checking, rises with the sun, No more do vineyards cheat with leaves alone ;
In his swift course throughout the rows he sifts
With ease ; some strengthens, others quite destroys.'
(H. D. 582-5.)
And Hesiod speaks of ' the season of toilsome sum
mer' when 'goats are fattest, wine is best, and men
weakest, since Seirios parches head and knees '
(Vide Vol.1. 144). The north-west wind, though accounted
stormy and dangerous in Hellenic, is, in many respects,
favourable and refreshing in Euphratean regions (Cf. Cant iv. 16), and comes from the Euphratean north.
' The greater part of the Antients,' observes Sherburne,

after the Summer Solstice, as Varro 29, as Columella
30. ... At this day with us, according to Vulgar
computation, the rising and setting of the said Star is in a manner coincident with the Feasts of St. Mar
garet (which is about the 13th of our July) and St.
Laurence (which falls upon the 10th of August), as
this common verse expresses it,

In the Eisagoge eis ta Phainomena of Geminos the

On the 11th, according to Eudoxos, Orion rises at
daybreak (eyo?). On the 23rd, according to Dositheos [who made
some stellar observations B.C. 200], in Egypt the Dog
appears. On the 25th, according to Meton [cir. B.C. 430], the
Dog rises at daybreak.
On the 27th, according to Euktemon (Vide Vol. I.
125), the Dog rises. According to Eudoxos, the Dog
rises at daybreak, and during the 5 following days the Etesian Winds blow.
On the 28th, according to Euktemon, the Eagle
rises at daybreak ; stormy weather at sea begins.
The Sun passes through the Lion in 31 days. On the 1st day, according to Euktemon, the Dog is
conspicuous. On the 5th day, according to Eudoxos, the Eagle
sets at daybreak.' Other Classical Calendars have similar entries. So,
in a Latin translation from Ptolemy, giving the Iner

The other remarkable constellation at this season,
it will be observed, is the Eagle, which was connected
with stormy weather. Thus Aratos :

(De Die Natali, xviii.). B.C. 45 the 1st Thoth=27th August, B.C. 1422 it=20th July (Vide
Wilkinson, Ancient Egyptians, iii. 103), therefore B.c. 2000 it=30th June. Classical authors also,
therefore, point strongly towards the identification of
Idkhu with Aquila, or rather with Altair. The



XIl] SOME STELLAR GROUPS OF SEVENS. 1 29
astronomical point of view confirms this conclusion,
for, at the date and latitude in question, i.e., July 10,
B.C. 2000 at Babylon, Altair occupied a position low down in the N.W. horizon, exactly opposite to Sirius, and they would be visible together for a short period.
Hence we see the force of line 22 of the Tablet.
These two stars are never visible together in England. 1
But Procyon and a portion of Aquila are seen together here in April and May.
All these considerations, however, whilst pointing strongly to the identification of Kaksisa with Sirius
are nevertheless not absolutely conclusive. They do
not necessarily exclude Procyon, although the circumstances generally by no means fit so well with the
latter star. But, next, a fresh difficulty arises with
respect to the Boiv-stav ; for, although, as noticed, Kak-ban (=Kak-qasti) is a late name, yet Ban (simply) is not. Thus, in K. 2253 (the text of which
unfortunately is not before me) we have ' forecasts
taken from observations of the stars' Kaksisa, Gil
(=Sem. Agu, ' the Crown,' possibly the Croivn of Istar- Ariadne, vide Vol. I. 33), and Ban (=Sem.
Qastu, ' the Bow '). This, at first sight, seems to
clear up matters ; it may perhaps be at once suggested
that Kaksisa=Procyon, and Ban=Sirius. But,
unfortunately for this solution, we learn in W. A. I. II. xxxix. No. 5, 1. 58 that Kakkab Ban [Qastu)=
Ilu Lubat, i.e., the Boiv-star=Jupiter. Suppose, however, we hold that Jupiter, chief of planets, is
the i?OK;-planet, just as Sirius, chief of fixed stars, is

the Bow-star. Even then our difficulties are not
over. Thus, in K. 2310, 1. 1-2, which are unfortu
nately much mutilated, we read : Kakhab Qastu . . . ris Hi innamar-va ina libbi ... * The-con
stellation the Bow . . . the-head of-the-god is-seen,
and in the-midst . . .' Now it would seem that the
constellation in question is Sagittarius, which, simi
larly, Aratos (Phainom. 623, 664-5) calls simply the
Bow (Tooi/) ; or, if not the whole of Sagittarius, then the iiow- stars. For, it will be observed that * the
head of the god/ a reference apparently to the human
headed figure of the Archer, primarily the god Nergal, is spoken of, and that in connexion with the
ecliptic, in which it actually lies. If the Bow here
were a single star, how could the expression
* head of
the god' apply to it I 1 Thus, we have (l) the Bow
planet, Jupiter ; (2) the ifow- constellation, Sagit
tarius ; (3) Kakqasti, the Bow-weapon-st&r, Sirius ;
and (4) a star or constellation, called simply the Bow [Ban, Qastu) ; and which may at times be one, at
times another, of these, or even at times something different from any of them, since e.g. Herakles
Engonasin is a bowman. In K. 12,099 we meet with
the stars Kha 2
(' the Fish '), Idkhu (' the Eagle '), and
Ban. On the face of it, we should imagine that the
scribe was observing the constellations the Archer,
Eagle and Dolphin, which lie together. In K. 12,136 Ban is mentioned with Khi-se (=Spica ? Vide Vol. I.
1 In W.A.I. IY. (2nd edit.) lii. Col. iv. 11, where the Kakhab Ban and the Kakkab Kaksisa are, with other personages, implored to deliver, Prof. Sayce understands the former as Sagittarius, and the latter as Sirius (Rel. And. Babs. p. 509). 2 For this reading vide Briinnow, Glass. List, p. 339. It is not the usual form of the word, and that used to denote Pisces and
Piscis.

65), Entenamasluv and Kaksisa. It is clear that Ban
and Kaksisa are distinct ; and if Ban h.eve=Sirius,
then Kaksisa=Procyon. In K. 12,654 Qastu {Ban) is mentioned with Sukadu (Kaksisa, vide sup. p. 121
n. 1) and Aqrab (Ak. Girtab, l the Scorpion'). But the full text of these Tablets is not before me, and as
the astronomer-scribes are wont to range very freely
over the heavens, we gather but little from the mere
association of names. In Tab. 81-7-6, 102 the
Kakkab Ban is styled Dilbat (an ordinary name
of Venus) in Ab, the fifth month. This might
mean that it was then a special
' Proclaimed' On
the whole, however, Ban is comparatively but little mentioned ; and if it be Sirius, this circumstance is
somewhat surprising. On the other hand, Kaksisa is
constantly mentioned in the Tablets, just as we should
expect Sirius, brightest of stars, to be a very prominent subject for observation. Thus, e.g., we find it mentioned
In Tab. K. 6507 with Supa (=Castor and Pollux.
Vide sup. p. 77), Li-e (=Crater. Sup. p. 108) and
Sar (=Regulus). In K. 7661 with Mul ('The Star,' i.e., the Pleiad ;
archaic Chinese Mol.) and Girtab (=Scorpio, wholly
or in part). In K. 7931, which states that it is copied from
' old documents ' in Babilu with Girtab, Idkhu (' the
Eagle '), and Kha (' the Fish. 1
Probably the Dolphin.
Vide sup. p. 130). In K. 10719 with Tsir (=Alphard. Vide sup.
p. 109) and Urgula (=Leo. Vide Vol. I. 62). But all this is inconclusive, and we must await more
light. I, therefore, leave the judicious reader to make his choice between Sirius and Procyon.



Y3^ PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [x
The last of the seven Lu-mdsi stars is Sibzianna.
We have seen reason to believe that the double Hellenic
Bootes- Orion is a reduplication of a double Euphratean
Sibzianna (Vide Vol. I. 287-8), a fact further illus
trated by the circumstance that, as noticed (Sup.
p. 110), the Lu-mdsi were also grouped as twins. A
careful consideration of the evidence, so far as known
to me, induces me to believe that there were a pair
of ' Shepherds of heaven ' in the Euphratean sphere, one in the northern, the other in the southern hemi
sphere. As single stars this pair were Arcturus and
Betelgeuse (a Orionis), respectively 4th and 9th in order of brightness of the 20 first magnitude stars.
As constellations the ' Shepherds
' were Bootes and
Orion. In the latter constellation, Betelgeuse and Bellatrix (7 Orionis) also form a pair of twins.
Betelgeuse is near the ecliptic and Gemini, and therefore forms part of the Sibzianna alluded to in K.
1551, where Jupiter is said to enter ana libbi Sibzi
anna, which may be rendered ' to the place
' or
'region' of Sibzianna. 1 Thus, too, when in a Tablet
(Vide Vol. I. 338) 7 Geminorum is defined as 'the
Twin of the Shepherd,' the ' Shepherd
' in question is either Betelgeuse or Orion, the latter being also called
in Euphratean parlance Duzi or Duwuzi (=Tammuz)
and Ningirsu ('Lord-of-the-i&er-bank'), the River in question being constellation ally the Eridanus,
which, in origin,=the Euphrates (Vide sup. p. 23). But, in addition to the excellent astronomical argu
1 In Vol. I. 288, I have translated ana libbi,
' to the midst,' but
the rendering above suggested is preferable in this passage. At the same time, it is, of course, impossible to say what was the exact northern boundary of the Euphratean Orion. Even at present the constellation extends into the region of the ecliptic.



XIl] SOME STELLAR GROUPS OF SEVENS. 1 33
ments of Mess. Sayce and Bosanquet, founded on
Tab. K. 8538 (Vide Vol. I. 287), there are other
passages which mention a Sibzianna which cannot well
be referred to Orion or to any part of it. Thus, in
W. A. I. III. liii. No. 1, Eev. 1. 26-7, after mention of
'the Star of Maruduku' (=Dilga7i- Capella. Vide
Vol. I. 221), we read : Kahhab sa arki-sn nazu-zu,
Jcakkab Sibzianna, ilu Papsukala, rukha raba e-ku
(' The star which behind it is fixed, the star Shepherd
spirit- of-heaven, the god the Guardian-messenger [Pap=f male,' ' youth/ ' to depend
'
; sukala= mes
senger'], portends a great wind'). Now this description cannot be applied to Orion, which is not fixed * behind '
Capella ; but is, practically, parallel with it. On the other hand, Arcturus is fixed behind
Capella ; nor is there any other first magnitude star
between them. And the further defining of this
Sibzianna as * the god Papsukala,' is, I think, in
tended to differentiate between Sibzianna-Papsukala
and Sibzianna-Ningirsu. Papsukala, the tutelary divinity of the tenth month, Dhabitu (Tebet), is described as the ' attendant of Aim and Istar,'
' lord
of bliss,'
' lord of the earth,'
' the Falchion,' and husband of ' the Queen of Copper
'
(=Istar-KyprisAphrodite. Vide Trans. S. B. A. iii. 170). In the
legend of the Descent of Istar to the Under-world, it
is Papsukala,
' the messenger of the mighty gods,'
who, being evidently in some special way a guardian
of the earth, and particularly during the absence of the sun, informs the Sun-god of the woe wrought by
the departure of the goddess. Thus, whatever Papsukala may have primarily represented, it is clear that, in a stellar aspect, he is identical with Sibzi
anna- Arcturus, the heavenly shepherd-guardian and



134 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xil
brightest star north of the ecliptic. In W. A. I. II.
xlix. 8 Papsukala is styled Ul-mi ('the Sign-ofevening'), an appellation which further tends to
identify him with Arcturus, often so conspicuous an
object in the evening sky ; and, in a stellar aspect, a very suitable husband for Istar- Venus.
Papsukala is described as being actually a weapon, Ugur ('the Falchion.' Sayce.) ; and one of the chief
weapons of Merodakh in his battle against Tiamat is
the sajparu, khereb, harpe, 'sickle-shaped sword/ 'scimitar' (Vide Vol. I. 180; sup. p. 71), whilst
another is the mul-mul-lu (' Spear.' L. W. King.
' Club.' Sayce.), a word compounded of the ideographs
Star + Star (i.e. intensive)=' the Very-light.' The
basis of this apparently singular symbolism is that
the stars, and especially the greatest stars, are im
portant weapons of the Light-powers against Darkness. And this line of thought brings us to an inter
esting historical development of the idea. We have
seen (Vol. I. 285) that the names Arktouros and Bootes
were at times used interchangeably,
' as if the great
star were a compression of the constellation, and the constellation an expansion of the star '
; and we observe
that the star itself is spoken of as a weapon. When,
therefore, the star and constellation are personified in
a human figure, this figure is naturally represented as
armed with some weapon. A Sem. name of Sibzianna was Sa ina kakki makhtsu (' He who fights with
weapons.' Sayce, in Trans. S. B. A. iii. 173) ; and
hence in Classical times Bootes is Hastatus, Lanceator
(=Mulmullit)> and Arktouros is (Ar.) Simdk-al
Rdmih (' The Prop-of-the-Lance-holder '). The Shepherd-spirit-of-heaven becomes in Ar. Hdris-al-Samd
('The Guardian-of-heaven.' Vide Vol. I. 285).
/



XIl] SOME STELLAR GROUPS OF SEVENS. 1 35
The importance of this stellar Guardian- of-heaven
is remarkably attested by certain special invocations.
The following (K. 2801 + K. 9490), of the age of Assurbanipal, contains a prayer to be recited ' on the
occasion of an eclipse of the Moon,' and is thus trans
lated by Mr. King :
I. '0 Sibziana ... 2. Thou that changest
the . . .
3. In the heavens ... 4. They bow down before
thee . . .
5. The great gods beseech thee . . .
9. At thy command mankind was named (==
* created ') !
10. Give thou the word . . .
II. Give thou my judgment, make my decision V
' The object of the prayer/ says Mr. King, ' is to induce Sibziana to remove the evil spells, bewitch
ments, spectres etc., that have followed in the train
of the lunar eclipse' (Bab. Mag. 115). The passage affords a good illustration of what Prof. Max Miiller
has termed Henotheism, i.e., 'a belief in single gods'
(Selected Essays, ii. 137), a state of mind in which
the divinity for the time being invoked looms so
large before the mental eye of the votary, that all
others are practically excluded from his homage. This
phase of religious thought, which constantly appears in the Rigveda, must not be confounded with Mono
theism. Here, e.g., Sibzianna is credited with the
creation of mankind ; for, to the Semitic mind, naming
and creation are identical acts. No name, no exist
ence. Sibzianna is implored by 'the great gods/
who, for the time being, are quite in the background of the worshipper's mind. But, it is also to be remem
bered that just as the star Kaksisa is identified with



I36 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XII
the god Ninip (Vide sup. p. 98), so, doubtless, Sibzianna represented another of ' the great gods
' in
a stellar reduplication. Tab. K. 3256 contains a hymn to the god Sib (' the
Shepherd ') ; and K. 2803, an inscription of the time
of Assurbanipal, relates to the temple of the god Sib in the city of Kharran. K. 9000 contains incanta
tions, prayers and the ceremonial connected with the
cult of the god Sib, sar musi (' king of the night '). In
K. 9003 Samas, the Sun-god, is styled
' king of the
clay,' and Sin, the Moon-god, ' king of the night.' It is therefore possible that the 'Shepherd' of K. 3256, 2803 and 9000 is the Moon, especially since the cult
of Sin at Kharran (Haran) was of remote antiquity
(Vide Hommel, And. Heb. Trad. p. 73). But, never
theless, considering that Sib, Sem. JRi'u, does undoubtedly stand for Sibzianna (Vide Vol. I. 338) in
some cases ; considering further the importance of the
position and cult of Sibzianna, and that Arcturus is
the brightest star of the northern hemisphere, I think, on the whole, we shall be right in applying these
passages to that star. Each Euphratean town and
district had its own special and peculiar patron stellar
divinity. Thus, Dilgan (Capella) was the patron star of Babilu, Margidda (the Wain) of En-lil-ki
(Nippur) ; and, if we are correct in the above opinion,
Sibzianna-Arcturus would have occupied a similar
position at Kharran, and, with the Moon and Mercury,
would have formed a special celestial Triad there. A
passage above mentioned (Sup. p. 133) connects
Sibzianna with ' a great wind.' This reminds us of
the passage in Geminos where he states that ' on the
xiith day of the Fishes, according to Euktemon,
Arktouros rises in the evening and Protrygeter [Lat.



XIl] SOME STELLAR GROUPS OF SEVENS. 1 37
Vindemiatrix, e Virginis] appears : moreover a cold north wind blows' (Ap. Petav. Uranol. p. 68). As
we have seen (Cf. Vol. I. 324), the early Greek star
and weather calendars were largely based upon Semitic
originals. But other cuneiform passages apparently refer > to the southern Sibzianna. Amongst these is that in
the Te Tablet above quoted (Sup. p. 16), which
connects Sibzianna with the stars of Gemini and the third month. Geminos says that on the xxivth day
of the Twins '
according to Euktemon the shoulder
of Orion rises, and according to Eudoxos, Orion
begins to rise.' Betelgeuse (Vide sup. p. 132), accord
ing to the Hipparcho-Ptolemy Star-list, is ' at the right shoulder' of Orion (Vide Vol. I. 91). In
W
A. I. III. lxiv. Kev. 1. 8, we read : Ina arkhi
Adari kakkab Sibzianna ina lib-su izzaz (' In the
month Adar [=Feb. -March] the constellation Shep
herd- spirit-of-heaven in its place is fixed'). This, in
all probability, applies to Orion. Eudoxos particularly mentions Orion in connexion with the xiiith day of
the Fishes. In W. A. I. III. li. No. 9, 1. 18, we read
that the Moon is declining ina gag-gar [Heb. kikor\ kakkab Sibzianna (' In the region of the constella
tion Sibzianna '). Here the reference is probably to
Orion, as Arcturus is so much further from the ecliptic.
In Tab. Sm. 1154, 1. 4-5, we read: 'The constel
lation Kha (the Fish) to the constellation Zibdnitum
(the Claws) is opposite. Kha to Sibzianna is opposite.' As the identification of Zibdnitum is
certain, whether the Fish here be Pisces or not, it is
almost certain that Sibzianna in this passage must
mean Arcturus, which is in the neighbourhood of the Claws. The range of observation of the scribes is so



138 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xil
wide that the mere mention in the same Tablet of
several stars by no means proves their proximity, even
when there is no indication that they occupy positions
far distant from each other. But, at the same time,
it is obvious in certain cases that all the stars under
consideration are in the same quarter of the heavens.
Thus, in K. 6227 Sibzianna, Lulim and Sugi are
mentioned, by which we may understand Orion, Aries,
and the southern stars of Auriga (Vide sup. p. 118). In another instance Ban, Mul, Kaksisa and Sibzi
anna, that is to say, Sirius, the Pleiad, Procyon and
Orion, appear named together. In K. 11,099 Dilgan, Mul, Sibzianna and Kaksisa, that is to say, Capella,
the Pleiad, Orion and Procyon, are the subject of observations. Tab. Sm. 1262 + Sm. 1271 takes a
wider range, and mentions Ban (Sirius), Sibzianna, Girtab (Scorpio), Sutul (=Sem. Niru, 'the Yoke/ =Muna-kha, Capricorn. Vide Vol. I. 81) and
Sukudu (=Kaksisa-P7t
ocyon). Sibzianna here per
haps=^4 returns or Bootes. In. K. 7621 Sibzianna
appears with Sugi, Wulmosarra (=the Wain. Vide
Vol. I. 267), 'the Star of the River Masgugar'
(=A, fx Sagittarii. Vide sup. p. 92), etc. Here,
again, Sibzianna probably=i?od^s, including Arcturus. Such is the principal evidence at present
available respecting Sibzianna, and I think that it
fairly supports the conclusion above suggested.
Section III. The Masi Stars.
In W.A.I. III. lvii. No. 6, 1. 57-61, we have the
following list of the Masi or ' Twin ' stars :
57. Kakkab Mas-tab-ba-gal-gal, kakkab Mas-tab
ba-tur-tur;



XIl] SOME STELLAR GROUPS OF SEVENS. 1 39

the Little Twins ; 58. Kakkab Mas- tab -ba sa ina Km -it hakkab

'The asterism of the Twins which in the neigh
bourhood of the constellation Shepherd - spirit - of

59. Kakkab Nin-sar, kakkab Ur-ra-gal ; 1 The star Lady-of-heaven, the star of the Great
city ; 60. Kakkab ilu Nabu, kakkab Sar-ur (u) Sar-gaz;
1 The star of the god Nebo, the star Director-of-fire
(and the star) Director-of sacrifice ; 61. Kakkab Zi-ba-an-na, sibu Ma-a-su.
'The constellation Life- maker -of -heaven, seven
Twins.' Or ' the seventh Twin.'
The Great Twins=Castor and Pollux (Vide Vol. I.
59 ; sup. p. 14). The Little Twins are not the
Little Twins of the Lunar Zodiac (Sup. p. 74), but
y and S Cancri. Sibzina=Sibzianna, and the Tivins
near Sibzianna will, in all probability, be 8 and e
Virginis. This appears inasmuch as the next pair of
Twins, Ninsar and Urragal, we have already (Sup. p. 83) seen reason to identify with y and n, 8 and e
Virginis ; and nearly all the Twins belong to the region of the ecliptic and several of them to this
particular part of it. Hence, the Sibzianna referred
to will be Arcturus. ' The star of Nebo,' i.e.. Mercury,
is a Twin by virtue of his two phases, Nabu and
Nuzku. As Sulpa-uddu (' The Messenger-of-theBising-sun.' Vide Vol. I. 343), Hermes-Mercurius
is a Morning-star ; and Nuzku, the Evening-Mercury, reappears in a familiar Homeric scene ;
' Now Hermes
called forth from the halls the souls of the wooers,



140 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xil
and he held in his hand his wand that is fair and
golden, wherewith he lulls the eyes of men, of whom
so he will, while others again he even wakens out of
sleep' (Od. xxiv. 1-4, ap. Butcher and Lang). That
is to say, Hermes the Evening-star
'
lulls,' and Hermes
the Morning-star
' wakens.' This character and office
of the Homeric Hermes as a shepherder of the shades
of the dead, finds a prototype in Nuzku ' the mes
senger of " the lord of the ghost world" '
(Sayce, Rel. And. Bobs. p. 119). Even the magic wand of
Hermes is earlier found in the hand of Nebo, * the
holder of the sceptre of power' (Vide Eawlinson, And. Mons. i. 141). Sarur and Sargaz we have
already met with as and \ + v Scorpionis (Sap. p. 90). The last of the Twins, Zibanna, was identified
with the Sem. Zibdnituv, origin of the Ar. Azzubdnay (' the two Claws of the Scorpion ')=<* and ft Librae
(Vide Vol. I. 70). But the Ak. name Zibanna (' Life
maker-of-heaven ') was, in origin, unconnected with
any word meaning ' claws.' It is a solar title which
was applied to Nidub (' the Lofty-altar'), the original Sign of the seventh month (Vide lb. pp. 70, 217). But it was also further applied to the planet Saturn
(lb. p. 346), between which and the sun there has
always been a special connexion in idea. Thus, a Gk.
name for Saturn was 6 rod rjXlov ao-ryp, and at times
it was simply called Helios (Diod. ii. 30). So Servius, ' Apud Assyrios Bel dicitur quadam sacrorum ratione
et Saturnus et Sol' (Ad. Aeneid, i. 729). Even Sir
G. C. Lewis observes, * The planets had, doubtless,
been named by the Babylonians and the Egyptians,
before they received names in Greece.' He probably
means, ' Before they received the Greek names which
we know.' People in Greece, as. elsewhere, must have



XIl] SOME STELLAR GROUPS OF SEVENS. I4I
called such splended appearances as Jupiter and Venus by some names from the remotest age. He
continues, ' The name of the sun, which was some
times given to Saturn, was of Chaldaean origin'
(Astron. of the Ancts. p. 290). Elsewhere he notes
the statement of Platon that the planets
* were first
observed and first received names in Egypt and Syria
'
(lb. p. 144), which merely means that the bulk of
the knowledge respecting them reached the Greeks
through the Phoenicians.
It will be observed that the two star-gods the
' Directors ' of ' fire
' and '
sacrifice,' or perhaps of
*
smiting,' form the end of the tail, including the
sting, of Scorpio. As noticed (Vol. I. 76) the sting of a scorpion is closely connected in idea with the
stroke of lightning, Ak. enum-gir (' heaven-smiter ').
Hence this pair of Twins are lords of (heaven-) fire,
of smiting (=the divine blow from heaven) and of
sacrifice. The Euphrateans, so observant of the
signs of heaven, would not neglect to take the phenomenon of lightning into careful consideration ; and
its importance in their eyes is reflected, e.g., in the
famous legend of the god Zu (Vide K. B. Jr., Sem. II.
xxiv.). Lightning certainly never obtained with them
anything like such importance as it possessed in the religious system of the Etruscans. But it is certain
that lightning-portents occupied a place of their own in the vast list of Euphratean ominous circumstances.
Thus Tab. 79-7-8, 311 treats, on these lines, of the
directions in which flashes of lightning travel ; and
various tablets treat of omens connected with the
Gir, under which heading lightning was, in all probability, included. The Scorpion itself was a divine
and terrible creature, specially connected with several



142 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xii
divinities, and afforded great subject for omens (Cf. Tab. K. 3956) ; and into such minute elaborations
was the science pursued that Tab. K. 11,746 actually treats of omens to be derived from the stings of
scorpions upon any particular toe of either foot. Such are the seven stellar Twins, and in obtaining
fairly accurate identifications of the Tiksi, Lu-mdsi
and Mdsi stars, we materially increase our knowledge of the members of the heavenly host as viewed and
catalogued by the early Babylonians.



CHAPTER XIII.
The Celestial Equator of Aratos.
In H. D. Appendix III., and subsequently more fully in my Paper C. E. A., read at the Ninth International
Congress of Orientalists, held in London in 1892, 1 have shown that the account given in the Phainomena of
Aratos of the constellation-figures lying on or near the
celestial equator, was, owing to the precession of the
equinoxes, quite incorrect when applied to his own age. At the same time I demonstrated that the
poet's statements were perfectly applicable to the latitude of Babylon, B.C. 2084 ; and thus astronomy
seals the testimony of history and archaeology in
designating the Euphrates Valley as the birth-place of the Signs of the Zodiac and of divers of their
paranatellons (Vide Vol. I. 14-15). Aratos, as we have seen, was innocent of astronomical knowledge,
and was merely the versifier of one or more of the
works of Eudoxos (lb. p. 121) ; and the astronomical
knowledge of the latter, despite the praises lavished on him by various classical writers, was evidently but
of a rudimentary description. It has been remarked that ' Eudoxos, as cited by Hipparchos, neither talks
like a geometer, nor like a person who had seen the
heavens he describes. A bad globe, constructed some
centuries before his time, might, for anything that
appears, have been his sole authority.' Hipparchos,
a practical astronomer, was surprised at the apparently



144 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS.
obvious and gross mistakes of his predecessor. He
assumes, not unnaturally, that the statements of
Eudoxos were intended to apply wholly to that
writer's own age, and embodied his personal observa
tions. In the interests of science, therefore, he pro
ceeded to correct them. But although the statements
in the Phainomena may, in some instances, be diffi
cult to understand ; although they may even occasion
ally be very hard to reconcile with any true
presentation of the actual facts, and may at times
suggest the idea that they are the outcome of the
investigations of various observers working in different
localities, yet we should not on this account cast them
aside as being arbitrary or inexplicable, an evasion of the difficulty which has frequently been resorted to
by scholars. The very fact that these statements are,
as a rule, precise and definite, and form an elaborate
whole or general scheme of the heavens ; and, further,
that they are recorded by an unscientific person,
renders the question of their actual origin well
worthy of the most careful investigation. As noticed
(Vol. I. 14), Aratos always speaks of the constellation
figures as of unknown antiquity, and he thus describes
the celestial equator, the particular feature of his
scheme at present under consideration :
1 In midst of both, 1 vast as the Milky Way,
A
circle trends 'neath earth like one in twain;
And on it twice are equal days and nights, At summer's close and when the spring begins. As mark there lies the Ram, and the Bull's knees ;
The Ram along the circle stretched at length,
But the Bull's crouching legs alone appear. And on it is the bright Orion's belt,
The Water-serpent's gleaming bend ; the Boiol
1
I.e., half-way between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.



XIIl] THE CELESTIAL EQUATOR OF ARATOS. 1 45
But small, the Grow, some few stars of the Glaios ;
The Serpent-holder's knees are in it borne. It does not share the Eagle, messenger Of might, who flies nigh to the throne of Zeus : On it the Horse's head and neck revolve '
(H. D. 511-24).
In illustration, then, of the archaic character, and of the Euphratean connexion of the observations
recorded by Aratos in reference to the celestial
equator, I will take the constellations named by the
poet in order, and compare his statements with a
Star-map of the principal stars near the equator,
compiled for the vernal equinox B.C. 2084, a date
when the Euphratean formal scheme or chart of the
heavens had been already completed. For that great astronomical work of the Babylonian savants the
J&nu Bill (Vide Vol. I. 331), which consisted of at
least 72 books, in its earliest form is as old as the
days of king Sargina (
( the Established ') of Akkad,
B.C. 3800. On comparison with the map it will be
observed that in every instance except one (Vide inf.
p. 146), the description of Aratos exactly agrees with
the position of the constellation-figures in the Baby
lonian heaven at the era indicated. We commence
with the Ram ' along the circle stretched at length,'
Aries, (Ak.) Lulim (' Earn '), called (Sem.) Kusariqqu (' the Strong - horned - one '), the name Lulim also
being given to Hamal (' the Ram/ a Arietis). Next come ' the Bull's crouching legs
'
(Vide sup. p. 42),
Taurus, (Ak.) Gut-anna=(Sem.) Alap-same (' Bull
of-heaven '), containing Mul (' the Star'),=the Pleiad, also called To (' the Foundation.' Vide Vol. I. 57), and Pidnu ('the Furrow.' Vide lb. p. 338),= Aldebaran.
We now come to the single instance in which the VOL. II. 10



146 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xill
text differs from the facts of B.C. 2084. Says the
poet,
' On it is the bright Orion's belt.' In B.C. 2084
the Belt-stavs were not on the equator, but about 12
below it ; and at the present time S, Mintaha (' the
Girdle ') is immediately below it. Hence, at the era
of Eudoxos these stars were more than 6 below the
equator. Supposing Aratos to have written tfivrj, which he almost certainly did, it must be concluded
that we have here an attempt on the part of Eudoxos
to correct the ancient statement, and so bring it up
to date ; for it is exceedingly improbable that the original account should be so exactly accurate in
every other instance, and so very incorrect in this.
But even this correction on the part of Eudoxos, an
unskilled astronomer, still left his account very
inaccurate. Nor is it difficult to see how the error
might arise ; for, whilst any one would know the
Belt of Orion, A, the nebulous stars in the Giants
head might well escape attention. Consequently the revised version would mention Zfivr}, whilst the archaic
account would mention Kecpakrj not, be it observed,
1 the bright head of Orion,' for the head is compara
tively dim, but ' the (dim) head of bright Orion.' In
restoring the archaic account we may therefore
read :
iv Se re 01 KE^AAH evcpeyyeog 'Qplwvos.
We next come to 'the Water-serpent's gleaming bend,' and observe that the stars a, yu, and y Hydrae,
and also a Crateris, a star common to the two con
stellations (Vide Vol. I. 106), are all almost exactly upon the equator. The Sum.-Ak. and Sem. names con
nected with these and the other equatorial con
stellations have already been referred to (Vide sup.
pp. 24-26). The equator passes through the Bowl and

Crow, and some few stars of the Claws (Chelai
Libra) ; and next reaches the Serpent-holders knees/ r\, the star * at the right knee '
(Vide Vol. I.
43), being almost upon it. * It does not share the
Eagle? but 'on it the Horses head and neck revolve.'
Thus, e Pegasi,
' the one in the muzzle '
(Vide lb. p. 47), is a very little way below the equator. Such, then, is the truly remarkable agreement between the poet, a learned literary man but no
astronomer, and in matters astronomical merely a
copyist, and the actual astronomical facts of 1800
years before his time. But, mark what necessarily
follows. These very constellation-figures, which,
according to the literary judgment of the poet, belonged to a remote antiquity, must have existed
at the period B.C. 2084, and must have then been
described as occupying the positions assigned to them
in the poem of Aratos. No one would or could say
that the Water-serpent's gleaming bend was on the equator at a period when the constellation itself had
not been formed. And so with the rest, and when
we turn from the necessary deduction to the facts
of the case, we find in the literature of this remote
period and also in its art these very constellation
figures. I have referred to them in previous places in this work, and in H. D. I have given pictures
from the monuments of the Bull, the Water-snake,
the Crow, the Claws, the Serpent and the Horse.
In E. S. R. Pt. iv. I have given two pictures of the
Eagle (Vide inf. Fig. iii. p. 198), one of them showing how the stars in the constellation were accommo
dated to the figure of the bird. 1 It, therefore, follows

that in the third millennium B.C. the Euphratean
Sphere contained our familiar Signs of the Zodiac, and
also various other of the extra-zodiacal constellations
now marked on our globes. For, in this list of
equatorial constellation-figures, we have three zodiacal
Signs, the Ram, Bull and Claws evidently occupying the same relative positions which they do to-day ;
whilst the same remark equally applies to the extra
zodiacal constellations Orion, Hydra, Crater, Corvus,
Chelai, Serpentarius, Aquila and Pegasus. We had already arrived at this conclusion by the aid
of independent literary evidence (Sup. Chap. IX.) entirely unconnected with the results of precession or
any other astronomic law. But it is well that the
great clock of the universe which cannot deceive, and
whose unerring and untiring hands point alike the
years and the ages, should add its striking testimony
in confirmation of historical, archaeological, and
linguistic research. There is one constellation -name on the Map (Fig.
II.) which has not been previously mentioned, Khu-zaba, which is found in W. A. I. II. xlix. 39.
Khu (' Bird ') occurs in each of the names of the three
constellations which represent the three Demon-birds,
opponents of Marduk-Herakles, the other two being Id-khu (' the Eagle ') and Raditarta-khu (' the Lam
mergeier : Vol. I. 35 ; Sup. p. 25). The Ak. Zaba
=Sem. Qistu (' Forest.' Vide Briinnow, Classified List, p. 482), the full name being * the Bird-of- the- Forest,'
i.e., the Kite, which, like the other two, is a fierce
bird and habitually builds in forest trees. As noticed
(Vol. I. 126), this constellation was known to the
Athenian astronomer Euktemon, B.C. 432, as Iktinos
(' the Kite '), Lat. Miluus, Milvus. The use of

the vague name Omis is thus explained by
Hyginus ; * Olor. Hunc Graeci Cygnum appellant : quern complures proptes ignotam historiam Mis, communi genere avium Ornin nominaverunt, de quo memoriae prodita est causa '
{Poet. Astron. ii. 9).
In the Map (Fig. II.) the Sum.-Ak. names are in
Roman letters, the Bab. -As. in ordinary type and in
brackets, and the modern Lat. names in Roman type
and in brackets.



CHAPTER XIV.
Further Consideration of the Buphratean Celestial Sphere.
Section I. The Dilbat Tablet.
The Tab. 81-7-6, 102, for acquaintance with which I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Pinches, may be
dated cir. B.c. 500. It is, however, undoubtedly copied
from earlier documents, for, as I have already had
occasion to observe (Sup. p. 14), no one in the reign
of Darayavaush I. was engaged in bestowing starnames and mapping out constellations. The Tablet is
of very considerable interest, and gives, but, singu
larly enough, not quite in their regular order, the 12 months with 12 special stars, each one of which has a
peculiar relation to some particular month. It did not,
however, end with these 12 stars and months, but
continued (1. 13) : Kakhab Mar-gid-da (=) kakkab Dil-bat ina samsi
eribi.

Now it is one thing to translate a cuneiform in
scription correctly, and it is another to understand it
rightly when it is translated ; nor are these two pieces
of knowledge always combined. One of the most
obscure departments of Euphratean astronomy and astro-theology is the connexion between the divinities
and the stars ; and here, as usual, I use the term star



XIV] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 151
in its comprehensive meaning, as including alike con
stellation, asterism and planet, as occasion may require.
Numerous inscriptions contain parallel columns, and, in these cases, the line in the second column has
usually a special relation to the line in the first.
Sometimes it contains an exact Sem. translation of
a Sum.-Ak. name or word, e.g. (Ak.) Ka-edinna
=(Sem.) Annabu (* Hare '). Sometimes it contains
not an exact translation, but an equivalent. Sometimes it contains the name of a divinity, who
frequently is not identical but only specially connected
with the subject-matter of the first column. Some
times, again, the subject-matter in the second column
is either entirely independent of, or only remotely connected with, the subject-matter contained in the
first column. It is, therefore, necessary to discriminate
carefully in each instance ; as otherwise stars and gods
get jumbled up together in hopeless confusion, conclusions obviously absurd are arrived at ; and, finally,
the scribes are at times accused of having made
mistakes in their statements. Now, as of course,
cuneiform literature, like other human productions, is
not free from imperfection ; nor need we suppose that
the entire astral system of the Euphrates Valley was absolutely harmonious and free from a certain amount
of variance and even of contradiction. But the theory
of a mistake in a document which we are endeavouring
to construe, should always be the last hypothesis of
explanation ; and it will be safe to assume, except in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary,
that a Babylonian savant possessed a knowledge of his subject equal, if not superior, to that of even the
youngest modern critical investigator. In order to
give a lucid presentation of the matter to the general



152 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XIV
reader, I will illustrate the foregoing principles by
examples : Dr. Briinnow's Classified List is a work as admir
able as it is laborious, and of the greatest value to all
Assyriologists. But there are always spots on the sun, and thus on p. 3, we find ' Dil-gan
'
explained as
1 Marduk : planet Jupiter.'
' K. Dilgan=K. Lu-bat
gut-tav.' Also='iT. Su-gi.' Now Dilgan, as we have
seen (Sup. p. 40), is not Jupiter, but Capella. It is
also not Sugi (Vide sup. p. 118). How, then, came
Briinnow to make these extraordinary equations? Simply, as his references show, because in W. A. I. IT.
lvii. 46 A we have 'Dilgan,' and, in the parallel column (B), we have ' Ditto,' which refers to a state
ment above it, in 1. 44, Nur Hi Lubatguttav or Lubat
gud, as some read it,
' A light of the god Jupiter.* That is to say, there is some special connexion, accord
ing to the Bab. theory of the matter, between the
planet Jupiter and certain stars of which Capella is
one. They are not Jupiter, but, in some special sense, are '
lights
' of Jupiter. Next, as to Sugi, Briinnow arrives at the equation Dilgan=Sugi, because in
W. A. I. II. xlix. 3, to which he refers, Dilgan and
Sugi appear in parallel columns (C and D). But what is the Tablet about ? Why it contains a list of ' 12
Stars of the West,' their names in parallel columns,
6 in each. Dilgan heads the first column, Sugi the
second. If I were to give a list of 12 kings of
England, similarly arranged and beginning with William I., and were to interpret on similar prin
ciples, we should arrive at the equation William I.
=John. The scribe is simply filling up his tablet with star-names ; the second column is only con
nected with the first in the same general way as,



XIV] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 1 53
in a historical aspect, John is with William I. This
shows how easily even experts may fall into singular
errors, unless a right principle is adopted at the outset ;
and I lay stress on the question of the real connexion
between parallel columns, because any hasty or malig
nant critic (and such unfortunately there are) may be eager to assert that I have overlooked this or that
text, which shows that such and such a star was only
a name for some planet or planet-divinity. To take another instance. Not all examples can be
as clear as the last ; we are moving amongst singular
intricacies, and endeavouring to wind a very tangled skein, but we must do our best. In W. A. I. II. xlix.
11-13, A B, we find :
KaJckab Dil-nu. Hu Is[tar. Kakkab A-nu-ni-tum. Ditto, Kakkab A-ri-tum. Ditto.
InK 4195 we find:
Kakkab A-nu-ni-tum. Dil-bat.
Kakkab A-ri-tum. Ditto.
Kakkab Is-kha-ra. Ditto.
It will be remembered that Dilbat (= Venus) is the
chief planetary name of the goddess Istar (=Aphrodite). K. 4195 goes on to place Girtab and Iskhara
in parallel columns. If, then, we treat all these as
mere equations, we shall be happy e.g., in such a result as Girtab=IsJchara ; but IsJchara=Dilbat, and Dilbat=Istar. But Istar=Anunitum, .'. Girtab=
Anunitum. But, referring to the Tablet of the 30 Stars
(Sup. pp, 90, 92), we see that Girtab and Anunitum
are absolutely distinct ; and found reason to hold that
Girtab=0, i, *, X and v Scorpionis, whilst Anunitum=
X, jul Sagittarii, and neither of them=the planet
Venus. The Kakkab Anunitum, as we saw, means



154 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xiV
' the Star of the Great Goddess/ ' The Great God
dess '=Istar, and Venus is her special and particular star. Yet has she others also, and amongst them are
X and /x Sag. We gather, therefore, that this location
in columns by no means necessarily signifies an equation, and, at the same time, certainly indicates a
special connexion. Istar, goddess of Dilbat (Venus)
is, in some way, specially connected alike with Dilnu,
Anunitum, Aritum, Iskhara, etc. Let us now return to 1. 13 of the Dilbat Tablet.
We have seen (Vol. I. 266-9 ; sup. p. 17) that Mar
gidda=ihe Wain, whilst Dilbat Venus. The scribe
cannot, therefore, intend the bald equation the Wain
=
Venus, which is absurd. He evidently means that
' at sunset,' for it is of that particular time he speaks,
when '
night starts from heaven/ as Homer says, and the bright TFam-stars almost at once become visible,
Margidda, the ruler of the ghost-world, acts as an
ancient proclaimer of eve, is in effect a Dilbat ; and,
in this sense, the Wain=Venus. Line 13 is followed
by 5 ' doubtful '
lines, the first of which similarly
identifies another star with Dilbat, after which the
text is broken. Bearing the above-mentioned prin
ciples in mind, let us proceed to consider the 12 stars
of the 12 months as given by the Tablet : 1. 'The sta,rNinsianna=Dilbat in the month Nisan.'
As we have seen (Vol. I. 346), Ninsianna (' Lady
of-the-garden-of-heaven ') is a name of Istar as the planet Venus (W.A.I. II. lxix. 20). At the com
mencement of the year, then, Istar herself, in her own
proper planet, is the ' Proclaimer.' Venus is often
styled Ninsianna ; thus W.A.I. III. lxiii. contains an
account of twelve ancient observations of the planet
from Babilu, in which this name is employed. It was



XIV] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 1 55
usual also for a planetary divinity to have different
names for different months. Thus, according to
W.A.I. III. liii. No. 2, Marduk (=Jupiter) was
styled Dunghaduddu (' the Hero-of-the-rising-sun '), also at times a name of Nabu- Mercury (Vide Vol. I.
345), in Nisan ; Utultar (' the Light-of-the-heavenly
spark ') in Iyyar ; Dilgan (' Messenger-of-light ') of
Babilu in Sivan ; Dapinu (' the Circler ') in Tammuz ;
Dir (the
' Dim,' or perhaps the ' Blue ') in Ab ; Sak
visa ('the Face-voice-of-light '), also a frequent name of Mercury, in Elul ; Nibiru (' the Strider- along ') in
Tisri; Rabu ('the Mighty') in Marchesvan ; Alam
(the
* Guardian-spirit ') in Kislev ; Sarru (' the King ')
in Tebet ; Gal (' the Great ') in Sebat ; and Kha Hi a
(' the Fish of the god !Ea ') in Adar, the month of
the zodiacal Pisces, originally Piscis.
2. * The star Aritum=Dilbat in Iyyar.'
We have seen that this star is closely associated
with Istar (Vide sap. p. 153). Jensen (Kosmol. p. 71) connects the name with the Heb. Yoroh (' to throw,'
' cast ') ; and regards Aritum as the ' Bow '-star of
Istar, goddess of the bow. Assuming, as seems probable, that Aritum is a Sem. word, I agree in con
necting it with Yoroh, whence is derived Yoreh
(' Archer.' Cf. 1 Chron. x. 3). But the meaning of
Yoroh here applicable to Aritum is not ' to shoot ' or
1 cast '
arrows, but ' to lay foundations '
(Cf. Gk.
fidWeo-Oai aa-Tv) ; as in Job xxxviii. 6 ;
' Who laid the
corner stone thereof?' The star Aritum, the ' Pro
claimer ' of the second or Taurus- month, is not the
Boiv-st&r, which, as we shall see, is the ' Proclaimer '
of the third month, but the Pleiad, Te (' the Founda
tion.' Vide sup. p. 14), the foundation and starting
point of the archaic year. If, however, as is possible,



156 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. \:
Aritum, like the great majority of Euphratean starnames when read syllabically, is an Ak. word, then we
must go to the Turko-Tatar languages for an explana
tion of it. Nor is one far to seek. The root ar
(whence such forms as ara, art, etc.)=' company,'
whilst tarn, torn, tum^ heap/ * collected '
(Vide Vambery, Etymol. pp. 17, 165) ; whence Aritum
would mean ' the Collected-company,'
*
Heap,'
' Clus
ter/ which, as we have seen (Vol. I. 272-4), is the
meaning of the name Pleiades. The result, therefore, in either case is the same ; and is, moreover, in exact
accordance with previous instances. Thus, in the Te
Tablet (Sup. p. 16) Te, Sem. Temennu, the Pleiad, is one of the two protagonistic stars of the second
month, Airu-Iyyar. In the second month, therefore, the Pleiad, Mul (' the Star '), succeeds Ninsianna
Venus in the special dignity of the Dilbat or ' Pro
claimer ' of the course of the year, and therefore also
of divers other weighty matters therewith connected. 3. ' The star Ban=Dilbat in Ab.'
We have seen (Sup. p. 120) that Ban (' the Bow '),
the Star of the Bow, is, in all probability, Sirius.
The regular order of the months is here abandoned,
and we pass from Iyyar, the second, to Ab (=part of
July and August), the fifth. Assurbanipal calls ' the month Ab, the month of the appearance of the star of
the Bow/ and relates how during his war against
Teumman, king of Elam, Istar appeared in a dream to one of his seers. ' She held a bow in her hand,'
and promised victory to Assyria (Vide Geo. Smith,
Assur-bani-pal, p. 117). 'This,' observes Prof.
Sayce,
' is the ordinary fashion in which Assyrian
art portrayed the warlike goddess
'
(Bel. Anct. Bobs. p. 277). I think that the Tablet of the



XI v] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. I 57
Dilbat-st&rs, all in some way specially connected with
Istar- Venus, departs at this point from the regular order of the months in order to give the next highest
place of honour after the Pleiad to Sirius, brightest of
fixed stars, thus so specially connected with the war
like phase of Istar as goddess of the bow. The Gk.
calendars, as of course, connect the Dog with this same
period of the year. Euktemon placed its appearance on the first day of Leo, and it indicated the beginning
of summer (Cf. Vol. I. 144, 157 ; sup. p. 127). 4. The star Nuwpe=Dilbat in Elul.'
We have previously met with ' the Asterism of the
Lorally-city,' i.e., Eriduga (' the Good-city'), and have
found reason to identify it with , 0- and -k Sagittarii
(Vide sup. p. 93). Prof. Sayce states that ' Eridhu
. . . took its name from its bow-like shape
'
(Bab. Lit. p. 93) ; or rather, perhaps, the sound-connexion
between Ari-tum and Eri-du suggested the idea. We
can see, however, the line of thought which connected
this asterism with the goddess of the bow.
5. The star Entenamasluv = Dilbat in Tisri.'
This asterism, the ' Proclaimer ' of the seventh
month, has already been identified with 20 Librae and
the stars adjoining (Sup. p. 86).
6. c The star Rap-pit = Dilbat in Arakh-samna '
(Marchesvan). This star-name has been read Ra-bu (' the Mighty '),
which as we have seen (Sup. p. 155) was a name of
Jupiter in this month ; and Jupiter may be intended
by it. The name, however, may certainly be also read Rappu, a word derived from the Ak. raba,
' weak,' ' shade-of-the-dead '
; and from rappu is de
rived in turn the Heb. Rephaim (Cf. Ps. lxxxviii. 10),
with the same meaning. Should Rappu be the cor



I58 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xiV
rect reading, the meaning will be ' the Ghost '-star,
with a probable reference to Antares, the ill-omened
star (Vide Vol. I. 73) connected with Mars, the
planet of death. 7. ' The star Gir-anna=Dilbat in Kislev.'
If Rappu=Antares, Giranna (' the Scorpion-ofheaven ') will=the lunar asterism Girtab (' the
Scorpion') which, as we have seen (Sup. p. 91), con
sists of 0, i, k, X and v Scorpionis. The patron
divinity of this asterism was, as noticed, ' Iskhara of
the sea'; and we have observed (Sup. p. 153) that
Iskhara, in some way,=Dilbat and Istar. Therefore
Girtab is a star peculiarly connected with Istar. The
divinity Iskhara- Istar appears to have combined male
and female potentialities, for Iskhara ' is said to be a male deity whose wife was Almanu. . . . That the
Phoenicians also knew of a male Istar is perhaps indi
cated by the Greek myth which made Europa the wife
of Asterios '
(Sayce, Eel. And. Babs. p. 254, n. 1, 2). This doubtless is so, and the male Istar further appears in the Ashtar-Chemosh of the Moabite Stone. The
androgynous concept of divinity is further illustrated
by Baal being styled
'
goddess
'
(LXX. in Hos. ii. 8 ;
Zeph. i. 4) ; whilst, on the other hand, Asharte
Ashtoreth was styled by the Phoenicians '
king
' and
' sun-god
'
(Vide Schlottmann, Die Inscrift Esch
inunazars, p. 143). If the star in 1. 6 is Rabu
(z=Jupiter), then Giranna will probably=#corpo. Gir, as noticed (Vol. I. 76) means '
lightning
' as well
as '
scorpion
'
; and throughout the connexion of Istar
Iskhara with Giranna and Girtab there runs the idea
of the heaven-goddess armed with the arrows of light
ning, connected by play of words with, and also, to
some extent, reduplicated in, the fiery Scorpion.



XIv] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 1 59
8. ' The star Uz (' the Goat,'=a1 + a2 Capricorni,
Algedi and Secunda Algedi. Vide Vol. I. Sl)=Dilbat in Tebet.'
9. ' The star Dilgan (' Messenger-of-light.' Capella) =Dilbat in Sebat.'
10. 'The star Kha ('the FA,,=part of Pisces)
=Dilbat in Adar.'
11. 'The star Sale (Sem. P2sw, 'the Head')=
Dilbat in Si van.'
We now return to the third month. ' The star of
the Head' probably=Po^x, the star in the head
of ' the easterly Twin 9
(Vide Vol. I. 338). 12. ' The star Nagar-asagga (=the centre of
Cancer. Vide Vol. I. 60 ; sup. p. 2i)=Dilbat in
Tammuz.'
We thus obtain a list of 1 3 stars specially connected
with Ist&r- Venus ; and the Tablet not only reveals to
us in part the peculiar and intricate relations between
the planetary divinities and the fixed stars, but also
assists in confirming various identifications already
obtained. The androgynous character of Ist&r-Venus
also fully appears in W. A. I. III. liii. No. 2, where
she is described as ' a female at sunset,'
' a male at
sunrise,' and ' an androgyne
'
etc. ; but the passage
does not concern the object of this work.
Section II. The Twelve Stars of the West.
The first part of the Tab. W. A. I. II. xlix. No. 1,
which contained a list of ' 12 Stars of the land of
Akkad,' is broken off; and only one of the 12 star
names is legible, i.e., 'the star Nibiru' called in
W. A. I. III. liv. No. 5, 1. 5,
' the god Nibiru,' which,
as we have seen (Sup. p. 155), is a name of Jupiter



l6o PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xr
in the month Tisri. We observe, then, that such lisl
included under the term mul, Sem. JcaJckab, planets,
single fixed stars, asterisms and constellations. The
Tablet next proceeds to enumerate ' 12 Stars of the
land of the West '
(mat Amurru) ; and, in the case of each locality, the list is, as of course, not intended
to be exhaustive. Certain stars are selected, and the
list is remarkable both for insertions and omissions,
the reasons for which are now obscure. The 12 stars
are given in parallel columns as follows :
Dilgan (=Capella). Sugi (=southern stars of
Auriga). Tsir (=Alphard. Vide Kaksisa (=Procyon).
Vol. I. 360).
Mastabba-galgal (=Cas- Bir (=Aldebaran) }
tor and Pollux). Nin-rnakh (=a and ft Lugal (=Regulus).
Librae). Zalbat-anu (=Mars). Allah (=the centre of
Cancer).
Khu-se-makh (=Corvus). Lula (a Cancri. Vide
Vol. I. 360).
It will be observed that as Jupiter is included
among the ' 12 stars of Akkad,' so Mars finds a place
among the * 12 stars of the West.' Bir ('the Ver
milion'), also a name of Mars (W. A. I. III. liii.
No. 1, Kev. 1. 20), is, in all probability, 'the red eye
of the Bull' (a Tauri). In W. A. I. III. lvii. 1 the
star Bir-va is mentioned, and is said to ' face '
Jupiter. This is not necessarily the former Bir, but may be
another red star, e.g., Antares. Nin-makh ('the
Great-lady ') = the goddess Belit (Vide Briinnow, Class. List, p. 446) ; and, as we have seen (Sup. p. 86), the kakkab Belit is a and /3 Librae. Se-makh'



XIV] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. l6l
('Seed-great') appears to refer to the star Khi-se
(Spica. Vide Vol. I. 65). The Bird (Khu)-of-thegreat-seed will be the adjoining constellation Corvus.
The stars Dilgan, Sugi, Kaksisa, Mastabba-galgal, Lugal and Allah have been already fully noticed.
Each of these 12 'stars' is either in or adjoins one
of the 6 zodiacal Signs beginning with Taurus.
Section III. The Fields of Anu, Bel and Ea.
We now approach a subject of considerable importance, and also involved in much difficulty and
obscurity, namely, the division of the celestial regions
or of a portion of them, including the ecliptic, into three parts between the three great gods Anu, Bel
and Ea. That there was such a division in Bab.
astronomy is certain, but were these several spheres of influence equal or unequal and what space did
they respectively cover ? Prof. Sayce remarks, ' Prof. Hommel has shown (Ausland, Nos. 4-7, 1892) that
the Spheres of the three "great gods" . . . corre
sponded to thirds of the Ecliptic, the sphere of Anu extending from the Bull to the Crab, that of Bel from
the Lion to the Scorpion, that of Ea from Sagittarius
to Aries' (Higher Crit. and Mons. pp. 69-70). Prof.
Hommel's Map (' Der Sternhimmel Babyloniens um
3000 v. Chr.') in Die Astron. der Alt. dial. iii. 7,
marks the space north of the ecliptic as the *
region of the gods,' and divides it between the three divinities
in the way indicated by Prof. Sayce. According to
this division, Anu has 3 zodiacal constellations, Bel 4 and Ea 5. I imagine, however, that Prof. Hommel
was not acquainted with Tab. 82-5-22, 512, which I do not think has been hitherto published. This VOL. II. 11



1 62 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XIV
Tablet, unfortunately now very imperfect, gave a list of 12 Stars of the Fields of each of the 3 gods, 36 in
all, these stars being, like the ' 12 Stars of Akkad' and
the ' 12 Stars of the West' (Sup. p. 160), selections
from the stars of a certain quarter of the heavens.
In the Bab. uranography the ecliptic was the path or
road through the regions of space ; and, as such, was,
as noticed (Vol. I. 361), styled (Ak.) Kas Utu, (Sem.) Kharrdn Samsi ('Path-of-the-Sun'). As, however,
it ran through the fields or regions of the three gods,
it naturally became their path; and so, in K. 10,985,
is called, in its several divisions, Kharrdn su-ud \_Sud
=Heb. Sodeh, 'Field'] Hi Anim (< Path of the field of Anu ') ; Kharrdn su-ud Hi Bili (' Path of the field of Bel ') ; and Kharrdn su-ud Hi a (' Path of the
field of fea'). In K 11,395 the 'path' or 'road' of
Bel is mentioned; and Sm. 781, of which unfortun
ately I have only 4 lines before me, and which con
tains observations of Venus, is very important in this
connexion. We read : 1. Kakkab Dil-bat ina kharrdn su-ud tla ippukha : mat Martu-ki i-na . . . mat Num-ma-ki emid.
' The planet Venus in the path of the field of Ea

Anu rose : a prosperer (na-kha-as) for the land of

...
Here the Ea-path is connected in special influence
with the terrestrial West, Mat Amurru ('the Land of
the Amorites '), Mat Mar-tu (' the Land of the path
of the Setting-sun '), just as in the celestial sphere the



XIV] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 1 63
Ea-region is in fche West, i.e., west of Taurus, the
starting-point and foundation. Thus, the presence of
a powerful planet in the Ea-region above is regarded as beneficial to the West on earth ; for the Tablet
evidently stated that some advantage was gained by
Syria as against Elam. Similarly, when Venus is in the Anu-path, to the east of the Pleiad and in the
eastern portion of the heavens, according to this
division, the planet becomes a '
prosperer
' of the land
of Elam in the East. In the same way, when Venus
is in the Bel-path, she is a cause of prosperity to the
land of Akkad, which is situated between Elam and
the West, just as the region of Bel includes the central
portion of the ecliptic, between the fields of Anu and
Ea. I may add that when the 4 quarters are con
nected with nations, the reckoning is Akkad N.
(=our N.W.), lam S. (=our S.E.), Gutium E. (=our
N.E.) and Amurru W. (=our S.W. Cf. Tab. K.
8484). Euphratean square pyramidal temples, like
their Egyptian daughter at Saqqara (Vide Vol. I. 69), were built with their angles towards the 4 quarters ;
and, hence, their N.=our N.W.
From the foregoing text we obtain fresh and inde
pendent proof of what portions of the ecliptic specially belonged to each of the three gods ; and we are also
reminded that Venus, or any other planet, could be
equally one of the 12 stars of the field of Anu, of
Bel, or of Ea. We notice, moreover, the archaic connexion between parts of the heaven and certain ter
restrial localities, a principle in full force in the
astrology of the present time. In further illustration
of the matter, we find a similar statement and similar
principles in Tab. K. 3601. This is a Bab. document,
and appears to have formed part of the Enu Bill (Vide



1 64 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XIV
Vol. I. 331), and therefore to belong to a period prior
to B.c. 2000. We read (Ob. 1. 1) : Kakkab Dil-hat ina kharrdn su-ud tl-a ippu-kha : mat Martu-ki ina khi-is mat Num-ma-ki emid*
' The planet Venus in the path of the field of Ea
rose : the land of the West with the crown (Cf.
W. A. L III. lx. 17) of the land of lam is strong.'
On this passage it is to be observed, first, that the
As. text (Sm. 781) above quoted has obviously, like very many other As. texts, been copied from a Bab.
version much older, from which, in this instance, we
can even supply the lacuna in 1. 1 of the As. copy.
Secondly, that the whole system embodied in both
texts ascends to a remote antiquity. The Bab. text
may have primarily referred to certain actual his
torical events, as do other portions of the JSnu Bili.
We are taken back to the period of Kudur-lagamar and Khammurabi, when Elam was at one time so
great even in the remoter West, and at another was
defeated by a power which, compared with the land of Nummaki, was certainly the West. Venus in the
Ea-region is of ill-omen for the East.
The same general principle is further illustrated in
the important Tab. K 1551 (Vide Vol. I. 288, where
read, ' The planet Sakvisa to the place
' instead of ' to
the midst '), which states :
13. Kakkab Sak-vi-sa {=Jwpiter\
' The planet the Face, voice-oj"-light.'
14. Ina kharrdn su-ud A-nim inamm-ir : abil
sarri aba-su.
1 In the path of the field of Anu is seen : the son of
the king his father '

Will slay, and the throne seizes. The path of the
field of Anu '

16. Mat Num-ma-hi : a-na mat Num-ma-hi id
da-gi-il. 1 To the land of Elam : for the land of Elam it-is-a

celestial region, specially concerns Elam, the eastern
terrestrial region.
Again, in W. A. I. III. lix. No. 1.1, L 8, we read : Kahkab Dil-bat ina kharrdn su-ud D. P. iJ-a
(Vide sup. p. 164). Most of the next line is lost, and part of 1. 10, but
the remainder reads :
A-na mat Mar-tu (' For the land of the West').
Here, as before, the presence of Venus in the western celestial region, specially concerns the western
terrestrial region. In W. A. I. III. liii. No. 1, Eev.
]. 15, where unfortunately the text is somewhat muti
lated, we find a statement connected with the present
subject : Gut-an-na se-pi-id tarbatsi su-ud Anim, kharrdn
Samsi. [(Kharrdn su-)ud A-nu=Kharrdn Samsi]. ' The Bull-of-heaven {Taurus) (is) the arbiter of setting of the field of Anu, the path of the Sun.' [(' The
path) of the field of Anu=the path of the Sun '].
Here the words in square brackets are a gloss, the
scribe explaining that by ' the field of Anu' is meant
in this passage, not the whole field of Anu, but ' the
path of the field of Anu,' i.e., the ecliptic. In 1. 16
the Bull is described as Ris bit-tarbatsi-su ('The
Head of the house of its setting '), meaning apparently that Taurus is the first of the constellations of the field
of Anu, the first to rise and therefore the first to set.



1 66 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xiV
In W. A. I. III. li. No. 9, we read : 17. Ina kharrdn su-ud A-nim
' In the path of the field of Ann/
18. Ina gag-gar (Heb. kikor) kakkab Sib-zi-an-na
(= Orion. Vide sup. p. 132).
' In the region of the constellation Shepherd- Spirit
of-heaven,
1
19. (Sin) it-ta-mar
' (The Moon) is seen/
We here again find that ' the field of Anu ' included
Taurus, and that a Sibzianna was identical with
Orion. In 1. 30-31 the scribe recounts a conjunction
of the Moon with Mercury, which happened ' in the
field of Anu.' In 1. 26 the scribe states that the
Moon appeared
' below the constellation of the
Chariot '
(Rukubu, Heb. Rekhev) ; and proceeds : 27. Ina kharrdn su-ud Bili iz-za-az.
' In the path of the field of Bel it waxes/
and it advanced ' towards (ana) the constellation of
the Chariot,' i.e., it drew closer to the IFam-stars as
it passed through Leo, which latter constellation we
thus note was in ' the field of Bel.'
In W. A. I. III. lix. No. 3, 1. 18 we read :
Kakkab Sag-me-gar ina kharrdn su-ud A-nim innamar.
1 The planet Jupiter in the path of the field of Anu
is seen.'
Such, then, generally, is the position of the fields of the three gods, and we will next notice Tab. 82-5-22,
512 (Sup. p. 161). The first paragraph contained a list of * 12 Stars of the Field of Bel/ the stars in each
case being named in parallel columns, like the * 12 Stars of the West '
(Sup. p. 160). Very unfortunately the names of the 9 first stars of the Field of Bel are



xiv] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 167
lost, and the names of the 10th and 11th stars only
partially preserved. The tenth star is Lik-gu \_-la~], 'the Lion' (=Leo. Vide sup. p. 16). Thus, in
W. A. I. III. lix. No. 13, we read :
3. Kakkab Lik-gu-la tsalmu ;
' The constellation of the Lion (is) obscured '
;
4. Lib-bi mati la dhabu.
1 The heart of the land (is) not at rest.'
5. Kakkab Lugal tsalmu;
1 The star of the King (=Regulus) (is) ob
scured.'
When the central portion of the ecliptic is obscured, the centre of the land and the central land (Akkad)
are supposed to be unfavourably affected. The 11th
star is Su. ... It evidently is not Su-gi (Vide sup. p. 118). It may just possibly be Su-gub-Gud-elim (' The-Left-hand-of-the-Horned-bull,'=a Lupi (Vide E. S. R. iv. 7) ; for, as we shall see, the fields of the
three gods extended to the south of the ecliptic.
There is also the star-name Su-pa (' the Lustrous.'
Vide sup. p. 76), which Prof. Hommel (Astron. der
alten Chat. iii. 16) thinks is applied to Spica, as
indeed it might be to any bright star. Spica would
suit the passage perfectly well, as it is one of the prin
cipal stars of the field of Bel. In K 12,690 Supa is
mentioned with Udgudua and Gula (Vide sup. p. 77). The 12th star is Uz, Sem. Enzu ('the Goat'), and
this is neither Capella nor Capricorn, but the xixth
Asterism of the Lunar Zodiac, ' the He-goat,'=*, k,
X Virginis (Vide sup. p. 85). Here is an illustration of the value of a correct understanding of the Tablet
of the Thirty Stars ; and this identification increases
the probability that in this passage Supa is named,
and signifies Spica. We thus obtain Leo, Spica and



i68 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xiv
/, ac, X Virginis for the 3 ' stars ' of the field of Bel.
The other 9 may very probably have been :
Alia, Sem. Tslru (' the Snake^Aljphard, a Hydrae). Margidda-Wulmosarra (=theWain. Vide Vol. I. 267 ; sup. p. 85). Sibzianna-Papsukala {=Arcturus-Bodtes). Mastabba sa ina limit Sibzina (' The Twins in the neighbourhood
of Sibzianna,& and e Virginis. Vide sup. p. 139).
Ninsar and Urragal (=y, S, e and rj Virginis. Vide sup. p. 139).
Imdugudkhu, Sem. Z$ (=Corvus). Nidub-Zibdnitum (=a and /3 Librae. Vide Vol. I. 70 ; swp.
p. 86).
Jupiter, and 3fars. Planets were not excluded (Vide inf. p. 174).
The Field of Bel, which, as we have seen, is specially connected with the Land of Sumir and Akkad, thus
comes first. Next follows the list of the ' 12 Stars of
the Field of Anu. 7 These are :
. . . . -makh. .... -nitum.
Gut-anna (=Hyads).
KaJc]-sisa (=Procyon). Ab-nam.
An-Tvi-a-mes.
Dilgan (= Capella).
Mul (=the Pleiad). Sibzianna (= Orion).
Ugaga-Miu (Sem. Aribu, 'the Raven'). Zibdnitam (Zibanna} =Satwn. Vide
Vol. I. 346).
Id-Klm.
As noticed (Sup. p. 161), the Field of Ann, according to Hommel and Sayce, extends from the Bull to the
Crab, both inclusive. Whether it also included the
Ram appears to me at present somewhat uncertain.
But, in any event, the star-list before us presents, on
the face of it, formidable difficulties. I am indebted
to Mr. Pinches for the names, the correctness of which
will be beyond doubt.
As regards the 1st star, there are various star-names
ending in makh (' great ') ; but the star in question,



XIV] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 1 69
cannot be Lik-makh {Leo), Khu-se-makh (Corvits.
Vide sup. p. 161) or Nam-makh (=P Aquarii. Vide
inf. p. 175), since none of these are in the Field of
Anu. We may read it Nin-makh (' the Great-lady '), and with Jensen (Kosmol. p. 71) understand this as a
title of Istar (Vide K. 4195). Istar, as well as Belit
(Vide sup. p. 86), might be called 'the Great-lady'; and, in this case, Star No. 1 wou\d=^Venus. But, on
this view, what is Star No. 2 ? The only stars I know whose names end in -nitum are Zibdnitum (' the
Claws '), Anunitum (=\ /* Sagittarii. Vide sup.
p. 92) and Anunitum, as a name of Istar (Venus.
Vide Briinnow, Clas. List, p. 463). But, if Star No. l=Venus, Star No. 2 cannot= Venus. Now, con
sidering that, as we shall see (Inf. p. 174), there are
no stars of the Ram included in the Field of Ea, and
how improbable it is that so important a star as
Hamal (a Arietis) should be altogether omitted, I
incline to the opinion that the Ram was, at all events
ultimately (i.e., when the year began with Aries), included in the Field of Anu, and 1 suggest that the
name of the first star was # Lulim-makh (' The Great
Earn '), which would also serve to distinguish it from
Lulim, the xixth asterism of the Lunar Zodiac (Sup.
pp. 65, 85). The second star-name I would restore as
Anunitum (=Venus).
We pass on to the 5th Star Abnam. This, as
noticed (Sup. p. 27), is also the name of an asterism
of the 6th month, which cannot be identical with the Abnam of the Field of Anu. If Abnam here means
! Proclaimer-of-the-Sea ' or 'of water/ it may=Ara&
kab Khigalld (=*i, m, v, y, Geminorum), the 7th
Lunar Asterism (Vide sup. p. 75). But Abnam also
=Sem. Shashurru (Briinnow, Clas. List, p. 170),



170 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xr
Heb. Shoshar ('Vermilion.' Cf. Jer. xxii. 14); and, if we are to understand it here as ' the Vermilion '
star, it will ipTobably=Betelgeuse (a Orionis), the
largest of the 3 first-magnitude red stars (Cf. Bir,
sup. p. 160).
We next come to a star-name which I have never
met with elsewhere, the Kakkab Ankiames. An=
Sem. Samu (' Heaven '), hi and kia (Vide Briinnow,
Clas. List, p. 399)=Sem. Irtsitu (' Earth '), and mes
is the plu. termination, the combination signifying 1 the Asterism-of-Heaven-and-earth.' At first sight
this may appear to be an almost impossible name for
a star-group, but let us examine it carefully. One of
the most important asterisms in the Field of Anu
must be Mastalba-galgal (' the Great- twins '), Castor
and Pollux (Vide sup. p. 16). Yet that name does
not occur amongst the 12 stars here mentioned, whilst
it is almost impossible to imagine that the Twins can
have been omitted. Can this special and peculiar
appellation
' the Asterism-of-Heaven-and-earth '=the Great-twins ? Yes, and most appropriately. We have seen (Vol. I. 58-9) that the original Twins were
the Sun and Moon, who are reduplicated in the
zodiacal Gemini ; and that the former mutually chase
and expel each other from heaven, so that generally
when one is up the other is down, and that this
feature reappears in Euphratean art when the Gemini
are represented (Vide Fig. vii. p. 231). We further
saw that this primary fact is dimly, yet undoubtedly, reflected in the Homeric account of Kastor and Poly
deukes, who are said to be ' alive alternately,' i.e.,
when the one is in the Upper-world of the living, the
other is in the Under- world of the dead (Vide Vol. I.
291-2). Here, then, we have the origin of the appar



XIV] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. lj\
ently singular expression
' Asterism-of-Heaven-and
earth,' as applied to the stars a and f$ Geminorum.
They represent, by virtue of the Law of Eeduplication, two stars (Sun and Moon), which, considered together, occupied at the same time heaven and earth. Hence,
I conclude that Ankiames=^Mastabba-galgal. The stars Dilgan, Mul (Vide Vol. I. 357-9) and the
southern Sibzianna (Ningirsu-Duzu) require no fur
ther notice here ; and I pass on to Ugaga (' the
Eaven,' vide Briinnow, Class. List, p. 260), which cannot be Corvus, as the latter is not in the Field of Anu
(Vide sup. p. 168). According to Jensen (Kosmol. 152-4), Unagga, as he calls this star, is a comet. If,
when the list was compiled, some particular comet was
visible in the Field of Anu, it might well be included
in the 12 stars of that Field. But, however regarded,
the question of the explanation of Ugaga is a very
difficult one. At first sight one thinks it ought to be,
and must be, Corvus ; and, again, why should a comet
be styled a ' raven '
? Jensen fully sees the difficulty in this idea, but facts are facts. The bird Ugaga is
explained as ' the Raven/ and is stated to be a star of
the Field of Anu, and we must make the best of it.
As to the link in idea between raven and comet, the
raven was also known to the Enphratean Semites as
the '
Eye-picker,' and a horde of Elamites invading Akkad are compared to an invading flock of ravens
(Vide Trans. S. B. A. viii. 81). Ravens were
amongst the evil brood of Tiamat (Vide Vol. I. 108),
and the bird has nearly always been regarded as ill
omened. A comet might similarly be looked upon as
an ill-omened bird of the sky. A somewhat detailed
account of the Ugaga is given in W. A. I. III. lii.
No. 2, 1. 1-12. It 'faces Sulpa-uddua' {Mercury),



172 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XIV
has ' a halo p round it, at times is ' misty
' and again is
' not misty,' and is said to be mi-colour. This word
is rendered by the Sem. arku (' green '), and the Ak.
Khu-sizi (' Sizi-bird '), the Sem. Rakraku, is the
Black Stork. ' The whole of the dark plumage is
varied with purple and copper-coloured and green
reflections, so as fully to justify the name which the Accadians gave to this bird '
(Houghton, in Trans.
S. B. A. viii. 89). Sizi will be a green yellow, be
tween sulphur yellow and gamboge ; and Prof. Sayce well translates the term '
greenish-yellow.' Ugaga is further said to be * like the god of fire,' Gibil (Vide
pp. 79-81); and in its midst are '3 stars' (Kakr
kabdni) very grey. Jensen translates, * In seiner Mitte 3 Sterne sind sehr grau.' Other renderings of
the passage have been given, but this seems to me to
be the correct one ; and it appears to be conclusive of
the cometary nature of Ugaga. Line 12 states that
it is opposite to the star Nunki (=, <r, x Sagittarii*
Vide sup. p. 93), which places it in the neighbourhood of the Bull and in the Field of Anu. In
W.A.I. III. liii. No. 1, 1. 4, Ugaga is said to 'por
tend a fixed tariff' ; and in lb. liv. No. 6, 1. 5, we
read :
Kakkab U-ga-ga-khu kharrdn Samsi iks-ud.
' The star of the Haven the path of the sun attained.'
This statement, again, can, I think, only apply to
some heavenly body which moves differently from a
fixed star, as the latter is either always in or always
out of the sun-path. No one has suggested that
Ugaga is a planet, and planets also cannot well be
said to attain the sun-path, as they are always in the
ecliptic region. This statement respecting the attain
ment of the sun-path by Ugaga appears again in K.



XIV] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. I 73
3547, which formed the 56th Tablet of the nu Bill
(Vide Bezold, Cat. ii. 542). The Ugaga-comet, therefore, must have appeared in the third millennium
B.C., to which period also the composition of the Tab.
82-5-22, 512, now under consideration, will belong. The account of Ugaga in W. A. I. III. lii. No. 2,
above noticed, is followed by a notice of the Kakkab
Idkhu (' the Eagle '), the only reason for placing them
together being that they were ' stars named after
birds '
(1. 21). Observations of the Raven and Eagle
also occur in K. 6194. In K. 9489 Ugaga is men
tioned with Jupiter and Bir (Vide sup.), which latter
may either be Mars or Aldebaran. In K 11,816
Ugaga is mentioned with Kaksisa [Procyon), Tsir
(Alpliard), etc. Both these references appear to point
to the Field of Anu, but I do not assert that the same
Eaven-comet is referred to in all notices of the
Kakkab Ugaga. The 12th and last star of the Field of Anu is Idkhu
('the Powerful'), the ordinary meaning of which is
' Eagle
'
; but as Aquila and Altair are far from this
portion of the heavens, we must seek for another
meaning for this name. Besides meaning nasru
(' eagle '), idkhu also signifies eru (' bronze/ W. A. I. V. xxxix. 46) ; and the Kakkab Urud (' Star of
Bronze,' Sem. firu) is named W. A. I. II. xlix. 61.
We observe by the inclusion of such stars as Procyon
and such constellations as Orion, that the Field of Anu
was not bounded on the south by the ecliptic. There
is only one remaining first magnitude star in this quarter of the heavens, the star-king Sirius. He, surely, would not be omitted from the list, which, as
appears from the case of Ankiames, has rather a par
tiality for unusual names ; and we may, I think, safely



174 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [x]
identify the ' Star of Bronze ' with him. As notice*
(Vol. I. 98) Ptolemy styles Sirius ' reddish -yellow/ the same epithet which he applies to Aldebaran, Antares, and Betelgeuse, the three great red stars of the present time. The question of the colour of
Sirius I have already discussed (Sup. p. 124), but I
will add a quotation from Ibn Alraqqa (Ap. Albiruni,
Chronology of And. Nations, ed. Sachau, p. 338) in further illustration :
' I recognise Sirius shining red, whilst the morning is becoming white.
The night, fading away, has risen and left him. The night is not afraid to lose him, since he follows her.'
Such, then, is the list of the 12 stars of the Field
of Anu.
Lastly, we come to the ' 12 stars of the Field of
Ea,' which are stated to be :
Gu-la ('The Urn.' Vide Vol. I. 84-5; sup
p. 16).
Nu-tsir-da (Vide sup. pp. 21, 89, 96). An-u-gie (=Anu-ge, ' Lord-of-the-Under-world ').
Nunpe (=(> " *" Sagittarii. Vide sup. p. 93).
, . . an-lugal ( . . .
' the god, the King ').
Papilsak (=X, m Sagittarii. Vide Vol. I. 78-9 ;
sup. 16). Subat, sa ina zumbi (' The Powerful-one, which is
at the tails.' Vide Vol. I. 81).
Kha( l the Fish'). . . . mulu-Tchu ( . , .
'
lordly -bird ').
\ Nin-makh (Probably=Femts. Vide sup. p. 169).
Sar-ur and Sar-gaz (=#, i, k, X and v Scorpionis.
Vide sup. p. 91).
Muna-hha (' The Goat-fish,'=(7apWcor^. Vide
Vol. I. 81 ; sup. 93).



XIV] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. I 75
The stars Gala, Nunpe, Papilsak, Sar-ur, Sargaz and Munahha require no further notice in this
place ; nor is there anything strange in Venus being also considered as a star of the Field of Ea. If we
understand Nutsirda here as=Namass?i (' the Kep
tile
t
=Ophis)i Anuge will doubtless=Ophiouchos. The position of Hercules and the Snake-holder, head
to head, is a reduplication of the position of the
Twins (Vide sup. p. 170). We saw (Sup. p. 39) that the Queen of the Under-world held a huge
snake ; and it is therefore natural that the King
of the Under-world should do so likewise.
Lugal ('the King') will be Antares, who is so
styled in the Tablet of the Thirty Stars (Vide sup.
p. 88). Subat is almost certainly /3 Aquarii, otherwise
styled Nam-makh (' The Mighty-destiny.' Vide Vol. I. 358). Subat is situated at the tails of Capricorn
and the Southern Fish, which, or its chief star
Fomalhaut, is probably the next star mentioned
(Kha). Part of the name of the next star is lost.
The Ak. mulu, the primary meaning of which is 1 man,' also means belu (' lord '), and the '
lordly
Bird ' can only be Idkhu (' the Eagle '), a prominent star and constellation of the Field of Ea. It will be
remarked that the scribe who composed this list is
somewhat fond of employing unusual appellations. It is quite in keeping with his use of Idkhu in an
unusual sense, and his application of it to a star other
than the Eagle (Vide sup. p. 173), that he should not call the Eagle by its usual name. Some of the
obscurities in astrologico-astronomical and religious documents may be designed in the interest of the
esoteric. Nam-makh is mentioned with the five
planets and Dilgan in K. 7951.



176 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS.
Such are the contents of this very interestin
Tablet. We learn much from it, and gain the con
firmation of various previous conclusions ; but it does
not inform us what was the extent northwards and
southwards of the Fields of Anu, Bel and Ea. On
the whole, I gather that they did not include the
mysterious Polar Region of the north, or the equally mysterious region of the extreme south, connected with the entrance to the Under- world.
Section IV. The Pole-Star and his Companions.
' There is a certain star,' says Hipparchos (Vide Vol.
I. 269)
' remaining ever at the same place. And this
star is the pivot (71-0X09) of the Kosmos.' So, with
fine instinct, Shakspere makes the imperial grandeur of his Csesar assert :
1 I am constant as the northern star, Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks ; They are all fire, and every one doth shine ; But there's but one in all doth hold his place.'
No wonder, then, that all over the world the Pole
star has been the subject of an attentive consideration,
which has frequently passed into the deepest reverence.
Nor is the cult of the Pole-star extinct to-day in
Euphratean regions. As it remains above 'high in immortal grandeur,' so on earth beneath by the banks
of the swift Euphrates humble votaries, a strange remnant of the long- vanished past, nightly look up to
it with awe and homage. The following is an extract
from a singularly interesting article,
' A Prayer
meeting of the Star-worshippers/ which appeared in the Standard, Oct. 19, 1894:

' Sook-es-Shookh, on the Euphrates, in the Meso
potamian villayet . . . looks picturesque and peaceful, as we ride into it in the deepening twilight of a late
September evening. The stars are beginning to twinkle overhead, but there is still sufficient light to
note the strange white-robed figures moving stealthily about in the semi-gloom down by the river side. . . .
" Their fathers were burned," cries our Persian guide
in disgust . . . thus delicately hinting that they are not followers of Islam ; and a Jew who accompanies
our party, on his way to the tomb of Ezekiel, spits
upon the ground, and exclains in pure Hebrew, Obde kokhabim umazaloth [' Servants of the stars and
Signs of the Zodiac' Vide sup. pp. 1, 162]. And the
Hebrew is not wrong. The forms gathering by the
river side are those of " Star- worshippers," the last
remnant of the famous magi [Cf. Jer. xxxix. 3, where
the * Rab-mag '
is included amongst ' the princes of
the King of Babel '] of ancient Chaldaea, and their
followers, the Babylonian adorers of the host of
heaven. To the number of about four thousand they
still survive in their native land, principally along the
banks of the Euphrates. . . . They call themselves
Mandaya, Manda'ftes, possessors of the " word," the
" living word." . . . Moslems call them Sabba,
Sabeans. Their dialect is a remanet of the later
Babylonian, and resembles closely the idiom of the
Palestinian Talmud, and their liturgy is a compound of fragments of the ancient Chaldaean cosmogony with
gnostic mysticism influenced by later superstitions.' The writer then describes how the star-worshippers erect
their 'Mishkna ' or ' tabernacle '
just before the cele
bration of their grand annual festival. ' An oblong
space is marked out about sixteen feet long and vol. 11. 12



I78 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XIV
twelve broad. . . . The side walls run from north to
south, and are not more than seven feet high. Two
windows, or rather openings for windows, are left east and west, and space for a door is made on the
southern side, so that the priest, when entering the
edifice, has the North Star, the great object of their
adoration, immediately facing him. . . . Towards midnight the star- worshippers, men and women, come slowly down to the Mishkna by the river side. . . .
By midnight there are some twenty rows of these
white-robed figures, ranked in orderly array facing the Mishkna, and awaiting the coming of the priests.
A couple of tarmidos, lamp in hand, guard the entry
to the tabernacle, and keep their eyes fixed upon the pointers of the Great Bear. As soon as these attain
the position indicating midnight,' a signal is given,
and a procession of priests, including
' the spiritual head of the sect, the Ganzivro,' moves to the
Mishkna. One ' deacon ' ' holds aloft the large
wooden tau-cross,' a second bears ' the sacred scrip
tures of the Star- worshippers,' a third ' carries two
live pigeons in a cage,' and a fourth has ' a measure
of barley and of sesame seeds.' The ecclesiastics file
into the Mishkna, and stand ' to right and left, leav
ing the Ganzivro standing alone in the centre, in
front of the earthen altar facing the North Star,
Polaris. The sacred book Sidra Rabba is laid upon
the altar folded back where the liturgy of the living is
divided from the ritual of the dead. The high priest
'
takes a live pigeon, *' extends his hands towards the
Polar Star, upon which he fixes his eyes, and lets the
bird fly, calling aloud, " In the name of the living
one, blessed be the primitive light, the ancient light,
the Divinity self-created." ' The worshippers without,



XIV] THE EUFHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 1 79
on hearing these words, ' rise and prostrate themselves
upon the ground towards the North Star, on which
they have silently been gazing.'
* The Ganzivro, who has made a complete renunciation of the world, and is
regarded as one dead and in the realms of the
blessed/ after the celebration of a kind of communion
in which small cakes, sprinkled with the blood of the
second pigeon are partaken of, recites a further
service,
' ever directing his prayers towards the North
Star, on which the gaze of the worshippers outside
continues fixed throughout the whole of the cere
monial observances. This star is called Olrna
d'nhoora, literally
" the world of light," the primitive
sun of the Star- worshippers' theogony, the paradise of the elect, and the abode of the pious hereafter.'
Such is the honour still paid to Dayan-same (' The
Judge-of-heaven.' Vide Vol. I. 264) in the land of
Sumir and Akkad.
Albiruni (Chronol. Cap. xviii.) gives an interesting, although somewhat confused, account of the Sabians, who, he says, adopted this name before a.h. 228
(a.d. 850), to save themselves from persecution. ' Before that time they were called heathens, idolaters,
and Kharramians.' He includes a calendar of their
various feasts and celebrations. In his day, as now,
their year began in September (Tishrin, Heb. Tisri, As. Tisritu), in which month took place
* the Feast of
Tents,' which may have been the ceremony related by
the writer in the Standard. Other feasts, etc., men
tioned are the Feast of Balti (=Beltu, Beltis) ; the
Feast of Tirratha (=Atargatis. Vide Vol. I. 224) ;
the ' Feast of the Venerable Old Man, i.e. Saturn '
;
the ' Feast of Hermes-Mercury
'
; the ' Feast of the
Living Being of the Moon '
; the ' Feast of the



l8o PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xiV
mysteries of Alsimak ' (=Spica) ;
' the Feast of Dak
dale' (=Tartak, 2 Kings, xvii. 31; Bab. Tartakhu, vide Vol. I. 35) ; and the ' commemoration of Tam
muza (=Tammuz) with lamentation and weeping.'
It is a truly remarkable fact that what I may call the
Euphratean religion has been in existence throughout the entire historical period. It did not die and make
no sign ; it has continued. And when we return
from actual cult to literature, it is quite certain that,
e.g., in the Talmud, and in many an unedited Gk.
and Ar. manuscript, hid away in the recesses of great
libraries, lies no small amount of Euphratean lore,
stellar and religious.
' I do not doubt,' says Ren an
(Nabathaean Agriculture, 1862, p. 92), 'that an
attentive analysis of Greek manuscripts on astrology,
on genethliacs, etc. . . . may show this result, that our libraries, in Greek no less than in Arabic manu
scripts, contain considerable fragments of Nabathaean
[=very late Babylonian] literature.' He further
observes :
' The writings composed in Greek and Arabic on
astrology, magic, oneirocriticism, such as the Cyranides, the works of the false Zoroaster, the books
attributed to Seth, and to Noah, the fragments of
Paxamus, of Teucer the Babylonian, and of Lasbas
the Babylonian, are frequently copies or translations of Chaldaean works. The works of the sect known as
Mendaites, Nazoreans, Christians of St. John, who must be classed generally under the name Sabians,
represent to us, to a certain degree, in their method
of thought, and possibly in their language, the
remains of Babylonian literature' (lb. pp. 3-4).
Again : ' This Teukelusha al-Babeli of Arabic and Persian



Xiv] THE KrPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. l8l
manuscripts is the TevKpog Ba/3iAcowo9, called also
Teucer, Zeuchrus, Zeuchus, author of genethliacs,
quoted by Psellus, by Antiochus the Apotelesmatist,
and by many others, and of whom extracts exist in
our collections of Greek manuscripts' (lb. p. 95).
Of these extracts, one,
' in the grand astrological collection of manuscripts 2420, 2424 of the Bibli
othique Imperiale,' is entitled Tevxpov Uepi twv irapavareWovTwv ('Concerning the extra-zodiacal constella
tions ') ; and this work is surely well worthy of the
attention of some scholar, and would, in all probability,
throw much light on many points still obscure.
To give an instance of how Bab. documents explain
matters otherwise unintelligible. We find that Madis
is ' name des Planeten Mars bei den Rabbin en '
(Chwolsohn, Die Ssabier, ii. 160). In Tab. K. 2310, Rev. ]. 13, we read: Kakkab Kha-dis (u) kakkab Ma-dis adannu innamaru.
'The star Gladly (=Venus) (and) the star Greatly
(=Mars) at eventide are seen.'
This passage is also interesting as an extremely
early instance of that name-jingle
' in which Orientals, more especially Arabs [and therefore their Semitic
kinsmen of the Euphrates Valley,] delight, e.g., Abil and Kabil for Cain and Abel' (Sayce, Herod, p. 138).
We are, of course, at once reminded of the Kpwcpi and
Muxpi of Herodotos (ii. 38), with respect to which
Prof. Sayce makes the above remark. Sir J. G.
Wilkinson, referring to the same passage, says that at the present day Orientals use in joke or in the nursery
similar words, ' the second repeating the sound of the
first and always beginning with m, as "fersh mersh"
" salta malta" And Canon Rawlinson adds, ' In



1 82 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xr
hugger-mugger and pell-mell, we keep to the Oriental
usage and employ the m' (Hist, of Herod, ii. 31). To return to the Pole-star. Although its steadfast
ness would naturally excite wonder and admiration,
yet prolonged observation necessarily revealed the
fact that even Polaris, like everything else, after a certain season abdicated its throne and moved on.
The reader is doubtless aware that the attraction of
sun and moon on the equatorial protuberance of the
earth, produces a certain rolling of our planet on its axis, with the result that from time to time the axis
of the equator changes ' its position with respect to the axis of the ecliptic, which remains immovable.
And the ends of these axes, or the points they occupy
among the stars, called their poles, will change in the
same way ; the pole of the equator, round which the
heavens appear to move, describing a curve about the
pole of the ecliptic ; and since the ecliptic and equator are always nearly at the same angle, this curve will be
very nearly a circle '
(Blake, Astronomical Myths, p. 99). Hence the Pole-star is that (prominent) star
which from time to time is nearest to the pole of the
equator, which latter makes a single revolution of its
circle in 25,870 years. The brightest star of this
polar circle is Vega, which was fairly near the pole
about B.C. 12,000. a Draconis was an excellent
Pole-star for some 500 years after B.C. 3000. It in
turn was superseded by ft JJrsae Min., which, as
noticed (Vol. I. 357), is consequently still called
Kochab (' The Star'). Our present Pole-star (a Ursae
Min.) is an excellent representative, and by a.d. 2000
will be in almost perfect position. In a consideration
of the Euphratean Pole-star of an early period it is
very necessary to bear these really simple astronomical



XIV I THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 1 8 J
facts in mind ; and before going further we notice
that the Pole-star B.C. 3500-2000 was a Draconic,
situate just between the two Chariots {Bears).
Amongst other treatises contained in the Bab.
libraries was one upon Ilu Tiranna (' the god Judge
of-heaven') 'which in the midst is bound' (W. A. I.
III. Hi. 58). The Ak. tir probably=the Turko-Tat.
tir, 'support,' 'prop.' As noticed (Vol. I. 285), Arctums and Spica have each been called Al-Simdk
(' the Prop ') ; and the Pole-star is par excellence ' the
Prop
' of heaven, and like Atlas, Mithra and Shu
(Vide lb,), upholds the columns of the heavenlyhouse. The name appears in Sem. as Dayan-same
(' Judge-of-heaven'), and we may notice that Sem. renderings of the Sum.-Ak. are frequently not exact
translations, but equivalents. In W. A. I. III. lxiv. Rev. 1. 1 a similar reference is made to Tiranna, and
in 1. 4 the obtaining of corn and barley is in some
way connected with it, and its disappearance is noted.
In lb. liii. No. 1,1. 7, it is connected with rain. In
lb. II. xlvii. 37 Dil-uri ('The Proclaimer-of-light') is explained as Dayan-samc, and in 1. 38 Azdg-a is
similarly explained. And this last title brings us to
an interesting passage in W. A. I. IV. xxviii. (PL ii.), 12 where mention is made of 'the god [or goddess,
probably both,] Azdga-siqqa, the mighty goat of Mul-lil.' The Ak. azdga=$em. ellu ('high') ; and if
we read the latter part of the name sug-ga (=Sem.
rukiitu,
' distant '), the meaning will be ' the Distant
high -one.' But, although Polaris is pre-eminently
' the High-one,' the epithet
' distant ' does not appear
to possess any special suitability ; and, on the whole,
I decidedly prefer to read Siqqa (' the Horned-one '), Sem. AttUu ('He-goat'). In W.A.I. III. lxvih. 12



184 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xiV
Azdga-siqqa is styled
' the supreme [ highest '] Siq of Mul-lil-la '
(' the Lord-of-the-Ghost-world '). Prof.
Sayce appears to render siq by ' milch-kid '
(Bel. Anet.
Babs. p. 286, n. 2), and in his Syllabary (No. 313) it
is equated with banu (' old-gazelle.'). Muss-Arnolt
(As. Diet p. 177) gives
' banu, probably an epithet of a wild animal=shining, brilliant of color.' The
Siq-makh, therefore, appears to combine the ideas of
'goat' and 'bright.' Azdga-siqqa ('the High-andHorned-one ')'is the Uz-mahh (' Mighty-goat') of Mul
lil, the Elder Bel, Lord of the world of night and dark
ness. We have seen the extraordinary mythological prominence of the Goat, and its connexion with the
Sun, Capricorn and Capella (Vide Vol. I. 80-1 ; 130-1 ; 218 et seq.) ; and here we find Polaris itself
impersonated as a bright Goat, the highest of the
flock of the Lord of night. We may further identify
it with 'the god Azdg-gi-tur-da' ('the Lusty-goat') named in W.A.I. II. lviii. 66. In K. 11,153 + Rm.
582, 1. 13, we are told that Nirgal, who was originally
' the god whom his primitive worshippers at Gudua [Sem. Kutu, Cutha] made king of ardli or Hades' (Sayce, Rel. And. Babs. p. 195), 'cares for the whole
of the Tul [Du. Jensen. Kirrud. }Lmg.\Azdga'
Mr. King (Bab. Mag. p. Ill) refers to Jensen's elaborate remarks on ' Die Schicksalskammer im Versamm
lungsraum
' in this connexion, and to his explanation of ' Duazaga 'as 'the lordly chamber ' of ' the Lower
World' (Vide Kosmol. p. 234 et seq.). But, really, the matter is much simpler, i.e., the Hades-and
Night-god cares for the whole of the ' hill
'
( Ak. tul,
dul, til, Sem. tilu, sadu) of the Pole-star (Azdga) t who is seated in majesty on the summit of the
northern heights. At night Mul-lil is lord of this



Xiv] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 1 85
starry hill ; it is crowned by his own bright Goat,
and, below this, his deputy Mulmosarra (Vide Vol. I.
267) bears sway over the powers of darkness.
The Pole-star was also called Dugga (otherwise
read Kaga)-gilgatil (Vide W.A.I, II. lviii. 17;
Sayce, in Trans. S. B. A. iii. 206 ; Briinnow, Class.
List, p. 40). Dugga=the Sem. Saqa (' High ') and is probably connected with the Turko-Tat, root toq,
tog,
' to rise up,'
' come to the top,' etc., whence words
meaning '
high,'
'
hill,' etc. The primary meaning of gil, as is also shown by the form of the cuneiform
ideograph, is 'an enclosure.' Til means 'life.'
Duggagilgatil=i The High-one-of-the-Enclosure-oflife,' and there is much reason to believe that ' the
Enclosure-of-life,' of which the Pole-star was lord, is the famous ' Oblong
' formed by the stars /3, y, n and
of the Little Bear. This particular Oblong, and the
connexion between Oblongs and the ' Quarters
' or
' Divisions '
(Regiones) of the heavens, have been
already referred to (Vide Vol. I. 25) ; and, as has
been noticed (Sup. p. 177), the modern votaries of
Polaris mark out an ' oblong space,' the side walls of
which ' run from north to south,' so that it fronts the
Pole-star in the same manner as the celestial oblong
of Ursae Min. fronts the star a Draconis. Here, as
so frequently, terrestrial ritual is based upon, and is a
'pattern' of 'things in the heavens.' It is natural
to suppose that there is some special place in the
universe which is in an occult and peculiar manner
the abode of the essence and spirit of life ; and it is
equally natural to locate this spot in the heights of
the north, ever crowned by the unsinking stars.
The god Tiranna was also specially connected with
the city of Uruk (=Erech. Vide W. A. I. II. 1. 54 ;



1 86 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. |\1V
V. xli. 1G), the earliest name of which was (Ak.) Urm-ki
('The Place-of-the-Settlement '), and whose patron
divinity was the sky-god Ana (=Sem. Anu). It was natural that the highest of the stars should be the
patron-star of the city of the Sky-god. Each of the ancient cities of Babylonia had its patron-star, as well
as its patron-god. Polaris stands in the same ritual
position to Erech, as Dilgan to Babylon and Margidda to Mul-lii-ki (=Nippur, Niffer). Tab. K. 12,462 contains observations on Tiranna, called as usual 'the god,'
not 'the star'; and K. 9250 contains ceremonies to
be performed by sick persons, and connected with the
cult of certain divinities, including Tiranna and
Damn (=Spica. Vide sup. p. 84). We noticed that the Sabians observed the ' Feast of the mysteries
of (Spica. Sup. p. 180). In K. 9417 a list is given of various divinities and divine pairs, male and female,
'
representing emanations of the male and female
principles of nature.' Amongst them are the Mul
tul-Azdga ('Lord-of-the-hill-of-the-High-one'),and the
Nin-tul-Azdga (' Lady-of-the-hill-of-the-High-one'). Azdg ('High') is connected with the Turko-Tatar
root os, its, ilz ('above,' 'upper side,' 'high,' etc.), whence such words as Uigur usaq (' high '), etc. Such
was the position of the Pole-star, guarded by the two fiery Chariots of the Bears, and presiding over the
highest and most sacred source of life.
In the list of gods in W. A. I. II. lviii. No. 1 next
to Duggagilgatil comes the god Esbar-anhi (' Crown
of-heaven '), the Sem. equivalent of whose name is
Dai/an-sisa (' the Directing-judge ') ; and next to him
is the god Giszalibri-gishi (' Temple-of-the-four-in
the-place-of-the-height-of-heaven '), explained in the Sem. as Lib uzztt mdti (' the Place of the Crown of



XIv] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 1 87
the land '). In Esbar-anki we shall have no difficulty
in recognising ft Ursae Min. (Vide sup. p. 182) ; and in ' the Place of the Crown of the land,'
' the Temple of Four,' we find the Gilgatil (' Enclosure-of-lifc '),
the Oblong formed by /3, 7, y and Ursae Min. It
is by no means improbable that the six names of the
' divine Judges of the Temple of Assur ' mentioned in
W. A. I. III. lxvi. E. 1-9, represent the six remaining
principal stars of Ursae Min., and that these, with
Esbar-anki, make up seven Great-ones (Kabtrim. Vide Vol. I. 169), Polaris being the Eighth. Assur=
(in origin) An-sar ('the Heaven-god Sar'), the analogue of the Aryan Varuna-Ouranos. His temple
is the celestial vault, and these stars, as the ' Judges
'
of it, occupy the highest seats. It will be remembered
that we have already met with four Kabeiric titles as
names of Euphratean stars (Vide Vol. I. 356) ; and
Movers, from the evidence at his disposal, has already connected Eschmun and the Kabirim with Polaris
and the stars of Ursa Min. (Vide Die Phbnizier,
1841 ; Vol i. 531). Upon this Bunsen remarks,
1 Movers' explanation of them [the Kabirim] as the Ursa Minor can only be true in a later astral sense '
(Egypt's Place, iv. 256). I do not suggest that this view is an exhaustive explanation of the Kabirim. It
merely presents them in a stellar reduplication. The Ak. Esbar-anJci=$em. Uzzu^-same (' Crown
1 I am not sure what was the Construct state of uzzu, whether
uzuz (Cf. uznu, constr. uzun) or uzz. A reviewer, not a 'critic,' of Vol. I. asserts that I am unaware there is such a thing as the construct state, although such a form as kalckab continually occurs in my work. The construct state is by no means always used in Bab.-As. The same reviewer also asserted that I was ignorant of
the meaning of hi in Barsip-/fo\ Ki, an Ak. affix denoting 'place,' is one of the first things learnt by beginners, with the other affixes



1 88 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xiV
of-heavcn '). The scribes were distinctly partial to
play on words, an instance of which is afforded by the
Ak. Uz (' Goat '), and the Sem. Uzzu (' Glory,' whence
the meaning ' Crown.' Vide Sayce, Rel. Anct. Bobs.
p. 285). We have seen the Pole-star described as a ' Goat '
(Sup. p. 184), and /3 Ursae Min. also, as Uz
same, becomes a ' Goat of heaven.' The first of the
other six ' divine Judges
' above referred to is (Ak.)
Sameld, (Sem.), Lu-kul-lali ('the Wild-heifer, voice
of abundance'). Taking the stars in order, Samela, (=Gk. SeyueX^, Vide R. B. Jr., Sem. l32-6)=y Ursae
Min. As Prof. Sayce has observed, the ' Goat with
six heads' is referred to in W. A. I. IV. xxx. 11 ; and
this mythical animal would be best explained by a
stellar connexion, such as that between the Goat-ofheaven and his six companion stars. Esbar-anki and
Sameld, as goat and heifer, reappear in the Arabian
Sphere as El-ferkaddn (=/3 and y Ursae Min.), which Ideler renders 'die beiden Kalber.' The
present Pole-star (a Ursae Min.) was, of course,
another of the same flock, as is illustrated by its
Arabic name Al-Jedy (' the Kid ') ; whilst another of
its names Al-Rakubat ('the Chariot'), Heb. Rekhev,
Bab. -As. Ruktibu, illustrates the fact that the Little
Bear was regarded as the Little Chariot (Vide Vol. I.
and prefixes. The reviewer subsequently withdrew this baseless
statement, but atoned for his burst of candour by asserting (somewhat
indirectly) that I was ignorant of every As. grammar except that published some years ago by Prof. Sayce. The reader will not be surprised to learn that the Editor of the review in question declined to insert a letter in which I exposed the ignorance and shortcomings of his scribe. It would show a lack of chivalry not to
throw the editorial aegis over a stupid and prejudiced reviewer, too lazy to study what was before him, and too ignorant to know how to construe a written document.



xiv] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 8 9
269). Al-Eakffbat=ihe Alrueaba of the Alphon
sine Tables (Vide Vol. I. 20, 284).
The name Azdga or Azdgga is also found in a
corresponding terrestrial connexion. The Du-azdgga
(' Holy-mound ') of Babilu was the E-Saggil (' House
of-the-lofty-head') or great temple of Bel-Merodakh, the successor and, in some sort, reduplication of the
ancient god Mul-lil. ' It is probable,' says Prof. Sayce,
' that the mounds now called Babil by the Arabs mark
where it stood '
(Higher Crit. and Mons. p. 154). The
shrine of the temple possessed a copy in miniature of
the Du-azdgga itself; and it seems, on the whole,
sufficiently probable that the temple and its arrangements were intended to be a pattern of '
things in the heavens,' and that, to the initiated votary, it occultly typified the Holy Hill of heaven ' in the sides of the
north' (Is. xiv. 13).
In W. A. I. III. liii. No. 1,1. 15, the kalckab An-ta
sur-ra is mentioned, which Jensen (Kosmol. p. 158) takes to be a meteor ; but to this I cannot agree. In
K. 11,283, four lines only of which are before me,
certain stars are named in the first column, and in the
second the planets with which they are specially con
nected, thus :
K. Zibdnitum (=the Claivs). I. Samas (' the Sun '). K. Antasurra. 1. Samas.
K. Dilbat. I. Istar (= Venus).
K. Anuniturii (Vide sup. p. 169). /. Istar.
There is nothing in either of these passages to
suggest that Antasurra is not an ordinary
' star.'
Samas is the presiding divinity of the month of the
Claivs. Dilbat is the ordinary name of Istar- Venus.
Anunit is another of her names, and, as we have seen,



I9O PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XIV
Anunitum is also the asterism A, m Sag. Antasurra
is not a planet, for the names of the planets also
occur in liii. No. 1. Turning to etymology we find
(Ak.) Antasurra rendered (Sem.) Tsuppuru sa libi
(Briinnow, Class. List, p. 30). The Sem. root tspr means * to go in a circle,'
' revolve,' ' dance in a circle,'
'
leap,' hence Heb. tsophir (' a he-goat'), primarily
'a
leaper.' We, therefore, observe that the Sem. title of
the Ak. Antasurra is * the Circler of the Midst,'
whilst the ideas of *
goat,' an animal so much con
nected with the Pole-star and his companions, and of
the eternal stellar dance (Vide Vol. I. 123, 133) are
also both included. A?ita=8em. Mil (' High.' Vide
Briinnow, ut sup.), whilst swrra=words meaning
'rising,' 'shining brightly' (lb. p. 141 ; Sayce, Syl. No. 99). Hence, Antasurra=l The High-in-rising.'
Let us note in passing that, as so frequently, the Sem.
rendering is an equivalent, not a translation of the
Sum.-Ak. name. Now the High-in-rising, who is
also the Circler-round-the-midst, can really hardly be
anything but Ursa Min., which may be specially connected with the Sun as a special ruler (of the
night) ; and, in exact accordance with this view, is
the rather curious passage in Aratos :
1 The head of Kynosure runs very high When night begins' {H.D. 308-9).
As Prof. Sayce also gives nas as a value of the form
which generally=a, I suggested (E. S. R. iii. 9) that
ANN-ASS-U-RA=(Gk.) K-w-6cr-ov-pa, the ordinary name of the Arktos Olige, and which a popular etymology understood as '
Dog's Tail.' There is nothing
at all improbable in the word Kynosoura (whence our
'
cynosure '=centre of attraction), like various other



XIV] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. I9I
names in Gk. astronomy etc., having been derived
from a Euphratean original.
1 The prefixing of a consonant not in the original is by no means unusual
in Gk. transcriptions. Thus the Sem. ydel=Gk. A/aX
(Hesych. in voc), Ati=T<xTi9 (Antipatros of Tarsos), etc. But, be this as it may, we can, I think, safely say that Antasurra=Ursa Min., which, at this period,
did not contain the Pole-star, but slowly circled
round * the Midst,' that central point of the heavens
where Polaris sat enthroned.
The night-revels of the mediaeval Witches' Sabbath, where the demoniac and Satanic Goat is high en
throned, are probably not unconnected in origin with
some distorted remembrances of the dancing Goat-stars,
Satyrs (Cf. Is. xiii. 21), of primitive Euphratean times.
Section V. The Tablet W. A. I. III. lvii. No. 5.
This Tablet, which has already been referred to
(Vol. I. 78, 110), is of special interest, inasmuch as it
shows very clearly the absolute identity of an important part of the Bab. Sphere with our own. Line 1
mentions Gud-elim (=Kentauros. Vide lb. 110-11 ;
213-4), and the following stars in this constellation
are also named, (1) Su-zak- Gud-elim ('the Right
hand- of-the- Centaur '=k and <r Centauri), (2) Su
gub-Gud-elim (' the Left-hand-of-the-Centaur'=ti
Centauri), and (3) Ner-gub- Gud-elim ('the Left-foot
of the Centaur'=a and ft Centauri). Most of the
lines are mutilated and contain little except the
names of stars, but these star-names show conclusively

I92 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XIV
that the Centaur of the Bab. Sphere, however much
he may have varied from the ordinary Classical type
(and on this point I have already spoken), was one and the same concept with the Centaur of our modern
sphere, a compound creature in form part man, part
animal. A full account of Gud-elim would doubtless
have spoken of the stars of his hind feet which now
constitute the brilliant Crux. According to the
representations I have given, both hands of the Centaur grasped the Wild-beast (Vide Fig. xv. p.
241). According to the Farnese Globe, he holds it
up with his left hand, and Ptolemy's list agrees with
this (Vide Vol. I. 111). Aratos says :
1 But his right hand he ever seems to stretch
Before the Altar's circle. The hand grasps
Another creature, very firmly clutched, The Wild-beast ; so the men of old it named '
(H. D. 429-42).
Thus, on the globe which was before Aratos, the
Centaur held up the Wild-beast (=Ligbat. Sujx
p. 5) with his right hand. There is a very curious
agreement between the Tablet and Ptolemy's List on
a singular point. In 1. 8 we read : Kakhab Ner-gub Gud-elim, qarnu-su yubbal. ' The star Left-foot of the Centaur, its horn dis
appears.' It would almost seem from this that Nergub was
not a single star, but an asterism composed of several
stars, more or less in a line, and which therefore made
a sort of horn (point). In Ptolemy's List Star No.
34 (^ Centauri) is described as ' the one at the frog
'
of the left foot (Vide Vol. I. 110) ; and a frog is ' a
sort of tender horn that grows in the middle of the
sole of a horse's foot '
[Imperial Diet, in voc. ). Now,



XIV] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 1 93
for what possible reason should the Classical constel
lation Centauries be credited with a '
frog
' in the
left foot ? Before the discovery of this cuneiform
tablet how hopeless such a question would have been !
It would of course have been answered by the arbi
trary assertion that this description was a freak of
fancy on the part of some one. The real answer is
now perfectly simple. The configuration of the stars of the leg and foot suggested to the Bab. observer a
'horn' of light. A horn, in the literal application of
the expression to the foot of an actual horse,=a frog. From this, as from so many similar instances, we
learn, as a general principle, to exclude arbitrary fancy and invention from such cases ; and, secondly, we note
with wonder the marvellous closeness of connexion in
detail between the Gk. and Bab. Spheres and star-lists.
In 1. 9 the scribe passes naturally from one centaur
to the other, who is also in the same neighbourhood,
and names three of the asterisms of Sagittarius
(Udgudua. Vide Vol. I. 78-9). The first of these
is the Kakkab Kumaru (' the Dusky-part '). The
meaning of this word, which is Sem. in form, was, so
far as I am aware, first given by me in E. S. R. (Pt.
iv. 11). A careful inspection of Sagittarius convinced me that its dusky hinder part was intended. I natur
ally compared Kumaru with the Aramaic kemer
(' blackness '), whence the name of the Kemarim
(Zeph. i. 4), i.e., 'the Black-robed-ones,' ' the idola
trous priests' (A.V. in 2 Kings, xxiii. 5). But this does not exhaust the matter, for, as might well be
expected, kumaru is merely the Sem. form of a Sum.Ak. loan-word humar, connected wTith the Turko-Tatar
root hem, qum, an allied variant of which is torn, turn
(Vide Vambery, Etymol. sees. 97, 179), one of the
VOL. II. 13



194 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XIV
root-meanings of this latter form being 'darkness,'
'
night/
' mist.' And the connexion between the
forms qum and turn appears also in the Sum.-Ak.,
where we find that ^m=Sem. khartsu (' obscurity ').
The Ak. kumar, therefore, will signify the ' Dark
part
' of Sag. ; and we are also reminded that these
Euphratean star-names, or most of them, are Sum.Ak. in origin, the Altaic word kumar having been
draped in a Sem. form.
The second of the three asterisms of Sagittarius
is (Ak.) Ega (Sem.) Agu ('the Crown') or Uzzu
(' Glory '), the bright upper forepart of the Archer (=Papilsak. Vide sup. p. 174); and the third is Kakkab Su-gub (' the Star of the Left-hand ')=y and
$ Sag. (Vide Vol. I. 77-9). Apart, then, from Euphra
tean representations of the Archer in art (Vide sup.
p. 44 ; inf. Fig. xii. p. 235), it practically follows
from such a description that the Euphratean Sagittarius was identical with the Gk. Toxotes ; and, as
we know that he came between the Bab. Scorpion
and the Bab. Goat-fish, we also know that he was in
the same celestial locality as Toxotes. Even if we
possessed no other knowledge of the Euphratean Sphere than that it contained Sagittarius and Cen
taurus, we should certainly be justified in assuming that it also contained various other constellation
figures of the Gk. Sphere. In 1. 11a further star of
Sag. is mentioned, the kakkab Ur-ner-gub Ud-gu
du-a (' Sole-of-the-Leftfoot of SagJ)^1 and /32 Sag. The Tablet continues :

The Tablet, now unfortunately mutilated, gave an
account of the constellation Zamama (Vide Vol. I.
45) in its four divisions. In W. A. L II. lvii. Kev. A.
1. 53 we read :
Kakkab Id-khu, ilu Za-ma-ma \ ilu Nin-ip.
* The constellation the Eagle (=Aquila), the god
Zamama,=the god Ninip' (=Ber. Vide Vol. I.
357). As already noticed, in the Euphratean Sphere the name Eagle was applied alike to the constellation
(Aetos) and to its principal star (Altair) ; a nomen
clature faithfully reproduced in the Hipparcho-Ptolemy Star-list, where the constellation is styled 'Aerov
aa-repiG-jUiog, and the principal star in it 6 \ajUL7rp69 koXov
fiews 'Aeros. We learn here that the constellation
Aquila is the star-god Zamama, ilu Zamama sa
Kisu (W.A.I II. lxi. 52. 'The god Zamama of
Kis'), 'a great town in Babylonia, now represented by the mounds of Hymer' (Geo. Smith, in Trans.
S. B. A. iii. 364). Next, as to the meaning of the
name * Zamama,' otherwise '
Zagaga.' The ordinary meaning of the Ak. za is '4,' but, as I have elsewhere
shown (Vide Proceedings S. B. A. Feb. 1888), the Ugro-Altaic c 4 '-word is an 'eye '-word, and the line



196 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XIV
of idea which arrives at 4 ' is represented by (Hand
+ hand + eye + ) eye. The following list of UgroAltaic ' 4 '-words (Vide K. B. Jr., The Etruscan
Numerals, p. 20) will make this evident :

god Zamama is, or is specially connected with, the
god Ninip, a solar divinity, described in one passage
as ' the meridian sun' (W. A. L II. lvii. 51), and
whose wife is ' the Lady of the Dawn' (lb. II. lix. 10).
Try as we may it is impossible in Babylonia, India or elsewhere to get rid of the Natural Phenomena Theory.

of day reappears in a secondary phase as the brighteyed stellar Eagle of night. And a further solar trait
in Zamama appears from his position as patrondivinity of the town of Kis, a name akin to the
Turko-Tatar root qis, qiz (' fire/
' warmth/ ' redness/
* to glow '), whence the Uigur qis (' fiery '), and numerous similar words in the various connected
dialects, with meanings such as '
gold/ - red/ etc.
Kis, Sem. Kisu, is, then, the ' Fire-town/ a centre of
a solar cult ; and Idkhu-Aquila was its patron star
(Cf. p. 186).
Such, then, is the Eagle Zamama, and the connexion of the name with ' 4 '
is further shown by the
division of the constellation into ' 4 stars ' or aster
isms, namely, (l) the Right-foot (Nerzak) of Zamama (=?/ Aquilae) ; (2) Idkhu (=Altair, a Aquilae) ; (3) the Left-foot (^Nergub) of Zamama, which is not mentioned in the Tablet, as it stands, but the exist



198 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XIV
ence of which is implied by No. 1, and which must=
S Aquilae ; and (4) the Head of Zamama. This
asterism, which would=e and Aquilae, does not
appear in the Tablet, as it exists, but is necessitated
by the formation of the constellation- figure, which
was different from that of Aetos in the Hipparcho
Ptolemy List. The an
nexed illustration shows
the Eagle, drawn, like many of the birds represented on the monuments,
in a conventional way,
as it appears on the Stone
represented in W. A. L III. xlv. No. 1 (Vide
sup. p. 34), and also shows
how the figure was adapted to the actual stellar ar
rangement. Here, as in
the great majority of instances, the constella
tion-former did not begin
by imagining that the stars of Aquila resembled
an eagle ; but, having the idea of an eagle already in his mind, he adapted the stars to such a form, making a suitable star its right
foot, another its left foot, and thus on. As we have
seen (Vol. I. 81), the star of the Goat (Uz), which is
naturally mentioned in connexion with the Aquila
stars, is ' the top of the head of the constellation of
the Goat-jish,'=al and a2 Capricorni. In 1. 14 we read of ' two conjunctions/ The term
1
conjunction
' is not here used in the ordinary astro
Fig. III. Idkhu-Aquila.



XIV] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 1 99
nomical sense of * the meetiug of two or more stars or
planets in the same degree of the Zodiac '
; but is
applied to two stars or constellations rising about the
same time and about the same longitude. So we read
in Aratos :
1 When the Goat (Capricorn) rises . . . others mount, The feathered Arrow's stars, the Eagle, Bird ' (H. D. 689-91).
The As. biritu, Heb. berith (' covenant '), is said to be
so called from ' the idea of cutting
'
(victims on the making of agreements) ; and the line of thought connected with this use of the word is : Cutting sacri
fice covenant (astronomically) conjunction. This is equally illustrated by the Ak. term of which birit is
the Sem. rendering. The passage in Ak. reads : Kas sa-ba-an-na sa-ba-an-na (' Two covenants [i.e.
conjunctions] of heaven '). The word is repeated with
a dual significance. I read sa-ba (not ri-ba), because the word is evidently connected with the Ak. sab,
sap (' to sacrifice '), the Turkic sefa (' agreement '), and the whole class of words belonging to the Turko
Tatar root sap, sab (' to hew,' cut '), e.g., the Altaic
saba (' cut.' Vide Vamb^ry, Etymol. p. 142). Both the Semitic and Turanian words, therefore, proceed upon the same line of thought.
Lastly, the culmination of Idkhu, the special Eaglestar, is mentioned. Thus Ninip, the zenith Eagle
sun of day, is reduplicated in Idkhu, as a zenith star of night. As noticed (Vol. I. 292) the zenith was
called (Ak.) an-va (' divine place*), Bab. nalbar- or
nalbas same (Cf. W. A. I. III. lxiv. Ob. 1. 24). The * star Nalbas-same' is mentioned in K. 6324, and
was, I presume, one which prominently occupied the
zenith at certain periods, e.g., Vega,
( the zenith
queen of the heavenly LyreJ



200 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [xiV
Line 15, which is unfortunately mutilated, names
the stars Ka-lik-ku, Uz (Vide sup. p. 198) and Saksa
di. According to W. A. I. II. xlii. 69, Kaliklcu is to
be read (Sem.) Lisdn-Kalbi (' the Tongue of the Dog,'
Vide Vol. I. 356 ; Briinnow, Class. List, p. 43), by which it is impossible not to understand Sirius, the
star - in the mouth '
(Vide Vol. I. 98) of Canis Maj.
In Cicero's Aratos Sirius is represented as lying on
the end of the Dog's tongue (Vide R. B. Jr., H. D.
Fig. xxxii). It is certainly singular that Sirius should be mentioned in this connexion, but the lines
are too much mutilated for us to be able to understand
their purport*; and the Kakkdb Ka-lik ... is also
named in 1. 17.
Saksadi (' Bright-horn-of-slaughter '), for which I
find no Sem. equivalent, is a very interesting starname, and=/3 Capricorni. The two stars Uz and Saksadi, which form the xxiind Arabian Lunar Man
sion, are called (Ar.) Sa'd-al-Dsahih (' The-lueky
asterism-of-the-Slaughterer '), in which appellation we find the influence of the original Ak. name. Smvth
observes that Capricorn * was mightily looked to by the Arabians . . . the xxiind Lunar Mansion was
a popular one ; and Kazwini, Tizini, Ferghani, and Flruzabadi of Khorasan, author of the Kdmus,
i.e., Ocean, the most famous of all Arabic Lexicons,
mention its happy tendency
'
{Cycle of Celest. Objects,
ii. 473). Now, the real original reason of the importance ascribed to Capricorn, and the origin of the
name Saksadi, are to be found in the preconstella
tional character of the Goat-Jish. It is the Goat-sun,
the solar god Uz (Vide Vol. I. 80), with his bright horn
(ray) of slaughter for darkness, night and stars, who
is the original auspicious figure. His good luck and



XIV] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 201
well-omened character are handed on to his astral
representative and reduplication, the Star-goat Cap
ricorn, the lucky Sign under which Augustus, most fortunate of men, was born.
In 1. 2 all is broken away except Kakhabdni Gu
si-sa (' the stars of the Directing-um '), and the same
phrase appeared in 1. 18, of which nothing remains but Gu-si . . . The reference is to the Urn of Aquarius
(Vide sup. p. 16), which, in the Lunar Zodiac (Vide sup. p. 67), stood at the head of the asterisms.
This Tablet, therefore, furnishes us with most
important references to Centaurus, Sagittarius, Cap
ricorn, Aquarius, Aquila and Sirius, all of which we find described much as on our present sphere. The
Tablet is an old one, as appears, amongst other cir
cumstances, by the fact that, in Assyrian times, it had already been mutilated ; for a scribe has added
khibi (' wanting '), to show that in his day a portion
of the original had perished. But, as of course, a comparatively quite modern tablet may bear an ex
ceedingly ancient inscription, a simple truth sometimes lost sight of by critics.
Section VI. The Obliquity of the Ecliptic.
In Tab. K. 2894, Eev. 1. 18 we read :
Irbayd kas-bu sikhkhi-rat samsi : sus kas-bu
sikhkhi-rat . . .
' Forty degrees=the circuit of the sun : sixty degrees =the circuit. . . .'
'The Kasbu' (Vide Vol. I. 325), says Prof. Sayce,
* was divided into 60 degrees' {Trans. S. B. A. iii.
238), and '
sixty was the unexpressed denominator of
a fraction' {Herod, p. 403) ; and this passage, perhaps



202 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XIV
a gloss, contains a difficult and important statement,
the explanation of which is, I think, as follows :
40
(= 2) f 60 =40 =< th e cirCuit of the sun/ It is
clear that kasbu must not be understood here in the
sense of ' double hour '
; for forty hours x 2=80 hours, is not in any way connected with * the circuit of the
sun/ This * circuit ' can hardly refer to anything
other than the sum of the degrees of the greatest
declinations from the celestial equator of the sun
during its annual revolution, i.e., 23g N. and S. at
the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn respectively, =47, not 40, as estimated by the scribe. And this
view is strengthened by the latter part of the line, which doubtless read :
* 60=the circuit of the
moon.' That is, |-r=l (kasbu)=60. Now the actual sum of the moon's greatest declinations is
(23i + 5) + (23i + 5)=57 , which is very near the
round number of 60 given by the scribe. He evi
dently gives 20 as a round number for the solar
tropic, and 30 as a round number for the lunar tropic,
instead of 23j- and 28 1 respectively. From these
statements it follows, therefore, that the scribe was
perfectly well acquainted with the obliquity of the
ecliptic (Vide Vol. I. pp. 124, 133). Mr. Pinches has suggested to me that possibly the
reading of the word above rendered sikhkhirat, may
be gir-rat (' progress,'
' advance '), from gardru (' to
advance '). Such a rendering would also be quite in
accordance with the explanation above given, and would refer to the extreme N. and S. '
progress
' or
1 advance ' of sun and moon.



XIV] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 203
Section VII. The Seven Eivers.
The sacred number 7 (Ak. Imina, Bab. Siba)
which, amongst other things, symbolizes Babilu (Vide Briinnow, Class. List, p. 488), appears in connexion with rivers in an interesting Tablet K. 4007, which
treats of seven non-terrestrial streams. It must be
remembered that in sacred or semi-sacred accounts
geography and uranography are at times intermingled, and the mythical and the mystical intrude upon the actual ; whilst things on earth are frequently
named after and are supposed to correspond occultly with things celestial. I will first refer to W. A.I. II.
li. Nos. 1 and 2, which have some bearing upon this
Tablet. No. 1, which has been translated by Prof.
Sayce [Records of the Past, xi. 147-50), and which is
called an 'Assyrian Fragment on Geography,' first
gives a list of countries, several of which, such as
' the country of Arallu '
(Hades), do not belong to terrestrial geography, and then (1. 25) contains a list
of rivers, at the eleventh line of which the Tablet is
broken off. Amongst the terrestrial rivers mentioned
are the Masgugar (' the Current,' i.e.,
'
rapidus Tigris '),
which is explained as ' the Bringer of Fertility
'
; the
Udkipnunki ('the King-of-the-Plain-of-Eridu,' i.e., the Euphrates), which is explained as ' the Life of the
Land '
; the Arakhtu (Gk. 'Apdfys), and the Ula (Heb.
Ulai, Dan. viii. 2 ; Gk. EuXaro?). Some other rivers
mentioned are ' the Biver of Mighty waters,' whatever
this may be, which is explained as giving life to the
Enclosure of life' (Cf. Gilgatil, sup. p. 185); 'the Kiver of the Fish,' explained as ' the Biver of Fishes '
;
1 the Biver of the Bird,' explained as ' the Biver of



204 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XIV
Birds '
;
' the River of the Serpent,' explained as ' the
River of Serpents
'
; and * the River of the goddess of
Nisinna,' explained as ' the River of the goddess Gula' (Vide inf. Zcty). In 1. 44 'the River of the
Serpent' is explained as the Nahru Martu ('The Bitter-river'), i.e., the Ogen-Okeanos (' Canal-of
water,' Vide Vol. I. 354), the encircling Ocean-stream
(Vide lb. 104-5). Turning now to K. 4006 + K. 4179 we find men
tion made of 'the River of Fishes,' 'the River of
Birds,' ' the River of Serpents,' * the River of the
goddess Gula,' ' the River of the god Marduk,' * the River Gan-gaV (' The High-cloud'), and * the River of the Sun -god.' As we have seen, the first three Rivers
are those of the Fish, Bird and (Ocean-stream)
Serpent ; and the explanation of the Serpent-river above given, shows that we are not here concerned
with earthly streams. ' The River of the High -cloud'
can only be the Milky Way (Vide Vol. I. 105), 'the
inaccessible Stream' of Egyptian mythology (Svp. p. 75). Gula (' the Great-one '), whatever else she may
have been, came to represent the primeval Ak. goddess Gurra (' the Watery-deep ') ; and hence her river
is what Jensen calls the ' Weltmeer,' the Zuab-abzu
(Gk. Z<fy) or primordial abyss (Vide Vol. I. 352). ' The River of the Fish ' will be that from the Urn of
Aquarius to the Piscis Australis, of which Aratos
says, near
* The right hand of the famous Waterpourer, Like a slight flow of water here and there
Scattered around, bright stars revolve but small,
And all are called the Water' (H. D. 392-4, 399).
This ' River of the Fish ' becomes ' the River of the
Fishes,
1 in which the Sea-horse, the Sea-goat, the



XIV] THE EUPHRATEAN CELESTIAL SPHERE. 205
Sea-monster, the Dolphin, the two zodiacal Fish and the Southern Fish all swim. ' The Eiver of the Bird '
will be that part of the Via Lactea in which the con
stellation Khazaba-Ornis (=Cygnus) is situate. This
becomes ' the Eiver of the Birds,' as it passes close by
Vultur (=Lyra) and flows through Aquila. 'The Eiver of the Sun-god
' is of course that of Ningirsu
Tammuz, ' the Eiver of Orion' Eridanus, on the banks
of which the luckless Sun-god, Phaethon, fell (Vide E. B. Jr., E.) There remains 'the Eiver of Marduk.'
I am not at present able to show that the Perseus
figure of our sphere was Marduk in the Euphratean sphere ; but many circumstances incline me to this
opinion, and I believe that * the Eiver of Marduk '
was the Galaxy as it flows through Perseus and past
Capella, the Marduk-star, and so down southwards
to Orion.



CHAPTER XV.
The Euphratean Star-List.
At this point in the enquiry it is desirable to tabulate
the results of the identifications of constellations,
asterisms and fixed stars already obtained ; and at this
point I would again refer to a wise caution by Prof.
Max Muller, which, given by him with reference to
etymologies, is equally applicable here :
c We must not clamour for mathematical accuracy.' I do not for
a moment pretend that all previous identifications
will ultimately be found to be absolutely correct. Such
a result would show an insight almost miraculous.
Here, as everywhere, probability is the guide of life ; and we do our best with the material at present avail

general principles of treatment are correct, and that all the more important conclusions arrived at are
beyond reasonable doubt. The stellar identifications

In this list all the primitive southern constellations
of the Greeks are included except the Hare (Vide Vol.
I. 97). It is not unnatural that but little should have
been said in the Tablets about such a small and com
paratively unimportant figure as the '
pale
' and
' dusky
' Hare, as Aratos calls it. But it is probable
that ultimately the Kakkab Ka-edinna (' Face-of-the
desert,' i.e., Hare) will appear in some fragment or other, and will thus vindicate the complete de
pendence of the West upon the Euphratean sphere.
The Hare is a very important figure in Zoological Mythology. Of the southern first magnitude stars
Sirius, a and /5 Centauri, Procyon and Betelgeuse
appear individually. Rigel ( Ar. Rijl,
' the Foot '
of Orion), jS Orionis, which in Ptolemy's list is common to Orion and the Stream, may perhaps be
specially referred to as Pur-edin ; whilst a and ft
Crucis would appear in the hind legs of Gud-elim, the account of which has been lost. I do not know
what was the Euphratean name of Canopus, second



XV] THE EUPHRATEAN STAR- LIST. 215
in splendour of the starry host, and which would be
just visible low down in the southern sky (Vide
Vol. I. 103). The remaining first magnitude star, Achernar (=Ar. Akhir-al-nahr, ' the End-of-the
River'), is too far south to be seen from Babylon.
Many other star-names besides these above men
tioned occur in the Tablets. Some of them are
additional names of several of the foregoing stars.
Others are planetary names ; others are names of
other celestial phenomena, e.g. :
Kakkab Ugaga-khu ('the Raven'), Sem. Aribu.
A comet (Vide sup. p. 171). Kakkab Zur (' Illumination '), Sem. Tsaruru
(K. 12,702). Either a meteor or lightning. Raman, the Storm-god, is the Ilu Zur (Vide Briinnow, Class.
List, p. 141). Kakkab Zurma (K. 11,129). This Tablet, in the
opinion of Dr. Bezold, treats of '
astrological forecasts taken from observations of meteors,' and is probably
a part of the finu Bili (Cat. iii. 1140).
Kakkab Batga (Rm. 2, 114) or Batgakas (K. 7275.
'Death-road'). Probably the Milky Way, so frequently connected with the Souls of the dead (Vide
Vol. I. 105). Thus the Lunar Asterism Kliigalld
(' The Canal-of-water.' Sup. p. 75) primarily refers
to the Galaxy, and reappears in the derivative Persian
scheme as Bakhvad ('the Watery-way '), which is
connected with the Bdhi-hdjiydn (' Road-of-the
Pilgrims,' i.e., the Dead)=the Via Lactea (Vide R. B. Jr., E. S. R. Pt. v. 18). Batga is not Mars, for Mars is mentioned in the same Tablet, both as ' the god Zalbat ' and ' the star ManmaJ
Kakkab Ilu Nin-Pes ('The Star of the god
Lord-of-the-Boar' or 'Pig.' K 12,325), also called



2l6 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XV
Kakkab Pes (' Star of the Boar.' W. A. I.. II. xlix.
49). The god Nin-Pes is mentioned in W. A. L II.
lx. 23, and two of the principal divinities of the
Euphratean pantheon, Ninip-Ber and Raman, are connected with the animal. Ber is the ' Lord-of-the
Boar' (Lb. II. lvii. 39), and, as he is the god of the
planet Saturn (Vide Vol. I. 244), I connect the
Kakkab Pes with that planet. As to Raman, Prof.
Sayce observes, * Rimmon, when worshipped as Matu [' Tempest '-god], was also known as Khumuntsir, the
Accadised form of the Semitic KJiumtsiru, " a pig"
(W.A.I. III. lxviii. 70; Eel Anct. Bobs. p. 153,
n. 6). Now the god Nin-Pes-edinna (' Lord of the
Boar of the desert. Vide Briinnow, Class. List,
p. 449) is a divinity whose name, by some read Aitsu, may also be read (as I prefer) Yari ; and Yari, lord of
the wild boar of the desert, appears to me to be
Ori-on (Vide Vol. I. 254), Tammuz-Adonis, who received his fatal wound when hunting that animal.
Here we have in origin the myth of the death of the
Solar-hunter, stricken by the tusk of the Boar of
storm and darkness.
Kakkab Uzu-zallu (' The Star of the Bright-body.'
W. A. I. II. xlix. 53). A comet.
Kakkab Gal ('The Great-star'). Sem. Rabii
(W.A.L III. Hi. No. 1, 1. 9). A comet. 'In its
rising like the body of a scorpion a tail it forms '
(1. 2).
Kakkab Ud-khir ('White-rising.' W.A.L II. xlix. 54)=Sem. Azkaru (' The New-moon.' Vide
Briinnow, Class. List, p. 326). The connexion between the planets and colours is
one of remote antiquity. In the Temple of the Seven
Spheres (Planets) at Barsipki (Vide Vol. I. 327), the seven stages from the base were coloured respectively



XV] THE EUPHRATEAN STAR-LIST. 217
Black for Saturn, Orange for Jupiter, Ked for Mars, Golden for the Sun, pale Yellow for Venus,
Blue for Mercury, and Silver for the Moon. This is
illustrated by the following seven star-names, which
occur in W. A. I. II. xlix. No. 4 :
Kakhab Aban Dusia (Sem. Diisu. ' The Star of the Diamond-stone ')=Satum. Kakkab Aban Kha-urud (Sem. Nun-eri. ' The Star
of Bronze-fish-stone ')=Mars.
Kakkab Aban Zakur (Sem. Uknu, '
lapis lazuli.'
' The Star of the Blue-stone ')=Me7*cury.
Kakkab Babbar (Sem. Kaspu. ' The Star of Silver') =the Moon. Kakkab Guski (Sem. Khuratsu. ' The Star of Gold') =the Sun.
Kakkab Urud (Sem. rA. ' The Star of Bronze ')=
Jupiter. Kakkab Ndbi (' The Star of the Proclaimed Vide
sup. p. 96)=Venus. Other star -names are partly mutilated and so un
translatable, and there are also various star-names
respecting which I do not at present offer any suggestions. Such are the Kabeiric star-names Kasmilu,
Kaskhiszu, Kassikisu, and Kassa (Vide Vol. I. 356),
and Tasana, Irbie, Uttid-ummari, Imsugilna, Kib
bubu, Antaruruba, Rapasilugil, Kassu (Cf. Kassa), Tsidar-antusi, Edan-antusi, Etur, Rutur and Kalmati.
The Kakkab Martu (' Star of the West ') is prob
ably Dilgan, which is the first of the 12 stars of the
West (Vide sup. p. 160). Martu seems also to be
connected with Kaman-Matu, the Storm-god (Vide Sayce, Rel. Anct. Bobs. p. 153, n. 6), which further
points to Dilgan (Capella).



2l8 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XV
The Kakkab Hi Ninazu (=Ninip-Ber) probably Entenamasluv, as a Lunar Asterism (Vide sup.
p. 86).
The Kakkab Hi a (Tab. 79-7-8, 223) appears to
be Gangusur (Vide sup. p. 87). In W. A. I. III. liii. No. 1, 1. 29 we read: Kakkab Pal-dara sukhal
' The constellation Libation-of-Ninip messenger Hi Tiskhu ana kakkab
of the god Tiskhu, to the constellation
Girtab dikhu
of the Scorpion (is) opposite.'
The Ak. pal=Sem. naqu ('to make a libation'); Dara=Ninip (Vide Briinnow, Class. List, p. 426).
Tiskhu=Niniip as ' god of libations '
(Pinches, in Proc. S. B. A., June, 1894, p. 226). Paldara, the constellation of Ninip, and which faces Scorpio, prob
ably=the original zodiacal Altar (Vide Vol. I. 69), afterwards Chelai, and now Libra. Ninip and Ip are
also connected with Entenamasluv (20 Librae etc.
Vide sup. pp. 86-87). The Kakkab Utssu (< Star of the Falcon.' W. A. I.
III. lviii. No. 11, 1. 7)=Ornis or Vultur (Lyra).
The Kakkab Kumaru (of Udgudua) has been
noticed (Vol. I. 78 ; sup. p. 193).
The Kakkab Mdkhar (Sup. p. 9S)=Capricorn. The Kakkab Ul-anna (' Sign-of-heaven'), Sem.
Asmu-same, mentioned in Tab. Rm. 2, 174, with
Capella, the Pleiades, Orion, Gemini, Procyon and
Sirius, probably=the Hyades. Thus, after making all due allowances in respect of doubtful and unknown stars, we shall have succeeded
in identifying no small portion of the stellar host ;
and are able to place the study on a firm basis from



XV] THE EUPHRATEAN STAR-LIST. 219
which further investigations may be conducted in the
future.
Following previous authority, I had assumed that there was a Euphratean ' Bear '-star (Vide Vol. I. 259).
But further careful investigation has convinced me
that this view is erroneous, and that we should read,
not 'bear,' but Damahu ('the Prosperous'), i.e.,
Spica (Vide sup. p. 84). It is a relief to get rid of the Bear, as there is clearly no place for him in the
Euphratean Sphere (Vide Vol. I. 260).
As regards cities and patron stellar divinities, Sin
(the Moon) was the patron of Ur, Samas (the Sun) of
Sippara (Sepharvaim, 2 Kings, xviii. 34), and Larsa (Ud-lab-ki) ; Venus and the Pole-star of Uruk
(Erech), otherwise Unu-ki (=Heb. Hanokh, Gen. iv.
17); Marduk (Jupiter) and Dilgan (Capella) of Ka-dimir-ra-ki (Babylon) ; Zalbat (Mars) of Gudua-ki
(Kutha), Margidda (the Wain) of Nippur, Zamama (the Eagle) of Kis (Hymar), Ningirsu (Orion) of
Lagash (Telloh), Nunpe (, a-, n Sag.), an Ea-asterism,
of Eriduga, and the Gula-star (the Urn) of Nisinna, the site of which is unknown.



CHAPTER XVI.
The General Concepts underlying the Constellation-figures.
Having thus, to a considerable extent, reconstructed
the Euphratean celestial sphere, and, in so doing,
proved that it was practically the mother and origin of the celestial spheres used by civilized nations
whether Classical or modern, we have next to enquire
what were the causes which resulted in the selection
of certain particular constellation-figures. To do this
efficiently we must, as far as possible, adopt the mental standpoint of the early dwellers in the
Euphrates Valley, and look round upon the external
world with their eyes. We may be encouraged in
the attempt by the reflection that we gaze upon the
same phenomena which met their sight ; and, further, that we regard them with the same human mind,
which, throughout all its varied phases of power, knowledge and ignorance, is, nevertheless, practically one and identical. The root-ideas, concepts and feelings which dominated remote Semites and Sumerians,
rule over ourselves ; and therefore we are looking
back, not upon unknown creatures, but upon ourselves as we existed, under somewhat different con
ditions, in the morning of the world. The natural
course of man's thought is from the simple to the
complicated, from the obvious to the occult. Long
ere he entered upon any detailed study of the stellar



XVl] THE GENERAL CONCEPTS. 22 1
host, he was occupied in considering the great and simple natural phenomena of light and darkness, the
ordinary dyad of which is day and night, so closely connected with sun and moon. To these may next be
added wind, tempest, clouds and the stars as a whole.
A brief careful observation of the latter luminaries
under favourable conditions, revealed the distinction
between the fixed stars and, at least, the four prin
cipal planets. To these must be added the pheno
menon of the rainbow and the occasional horror of an
eclipse.
1 The first point upon which man had to
satisfy himself was that regularity and stability pervaded the phenomena of the external world, that it
was dominated by what I have called the Law of
Kosmic Order. With this principle eclipses appeared at first to be in striking conflict, and the horror which
they occasioned represents the terrible doubt that the
belief in the order and stability of things to which
the race had slowly attained, was in reality erroneous.
On the terrestrial side, man observed himself and his
fellow and the other animals, the productions and
varieties of the earth, and the sea. He was conscious,
more or less dimly, of the ideas of power, force, life, fear, love in its variant phases, and he could measure.
From the necessity of his being he measured from
himself, and he argued by analogy. Thus, in his
thought and speech he enveloped all things in a web
or principle of anthropomorphism. He sometimes believed literally in his own phrases ; at other times,
1 Cf. Archil ochos, 'Nothing is to be unlooked for by men,
nothing gainsaid upon oath, nothing is marvellous, seeing that Zeus has brought about night from noon-day, hiding the light of the sun, and grievous fear came upon men '
(Frag, lxxiv., ap. Bergk, tr. by F. Brooks).



22 2 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XVI
again, he knew that they were but phrases. Thus, as he noticed that Sun and Dawn are hidden together in
the Darkness, he said that Asar (Osiris) and As (Isis) were linked in love in their mother's womb. Here,
at first he knew he was speaking by way of mortal
analogy ; he probably subsequently forgot this fact, and regarded the utterance as the expression of a
literal and highly mysterious truth. His power of measurement supplied him with the concept of God ;
he necessarily regarded the Divinity as his own shadow, dilated to a gigantic size. Man shouts, God thunders. The divisions of the external world, and
of spheres of effort suggest different gods. The sun
is distinct from the moon ; therefore the sun-god is
distinct from the moon-god. The peculiarities and specialities of different countries and climates pro
duced variant phases of the common faith ; but,
although as different as the letters of the many exist
ing alphabets, they are all based, like the latter, on
an original unity. The widely differing forms at first suggest in each case distinct origins, but the
variances are not fundamental. Thus, the difference
between the beliefs of Scandinavia and of Egypt is
merely that of local colouring. The hippopotamus
could not be a god-form or constellation-figure in regions where the animal was unknown. Lastly, man
was a borrower, imitator and adapter, not an absolute
inventor ; and his imitation, though not so obviously
crude as that of his monkey friends, was yet infinitely more intense. Thus, his religious ritual was, in most
instances, to a very considerable extent originally
modelled on the daily phenomena and panorama of nature.
I am not writing upon the origin of civilization or



XVl] THE GENERAL CONCEPTS. 223
of religion, but merely upon the rise and earlier
history of certain constellation-figures ; and therefore in the foregoing brief general remarks, I only wish to indicate in outline the mass of material upon which
the human mind had to work in its efforts in this
particular direction. Dyads and triads naturally arose in idea from the consideration of such pairs as
day and night, light and darkness, morn and eve, sun and moon, man and woman ; or from threes, such as
sun, moon and evening-star, father, mother and child, etc. Man further observed in nature and hence trans
ferred to his own active cogitations, a principle which I have termed the Law of Reduplication. He noticed
a constant repetition in the phenomena of the external
world. Dawn followed dawn, sun succeeded sun day
after day. He looked upon his fellow man, saw him
self again, and learned that two was one repeated.
He further noticed that this repetition was either
exact or variant, e.g., new but similar combinations of
clouds; or, again, woman, i.e., wife-man. And all
reduplication was connected with intensity of con
tinuance, of being, of wish, of effort. Thus it took
the form of emphasis, of direct phonetic and linguistic
repetition, of pictorial reduplication as shown in cuneiform and other ideographs, and of purely mental
reduplication, which latter applied to (1) personages, (2) general ideas, and (3) their embodiment in myth, legend and folklore. Now, to take a particular in
stance, the object which to us is not only infinitely the most important, but also by far the most remark
able, is the Sun. I need not refer here to the sun's
place in mythology (Vide R. B. Jr., E. p. 27). The
prominence of this is necessarily acknowledged by writers of every mythological school. But 1 com

mence with the sun here because the numberless
forms which it assumes in mythic fancy, under the
influence of the anthropomorphic principle, are alike the best illustrations of the Law of Reduplication, and
are also closely connected with the origin of the con
stellation-figures. The Sun hastens across heaven
and earth, and rises from and disappears in the earth
and sea ; he therefore strides, runs, gallops, drives,
sails, swims, flies (Cf. Pegasos), chases the dawn, the
clouds, the moon, the stars, is born, grows up, loves, leaves, rejoins his beloved, shoots the arrow and hurls
the spear, is an eye, a wheel, a shield, is wounded,
thorn-pricked, poisoned, sick, leprous, blinded, toils,
fights, burns, kills his friends and his enemies, dies, and is reborn in endless life. And these phases are
but a few, a very few, of his personified activities.
Thus, naturally, the Sun is personified and regarded
as a Shepherd (Cf. Vol. I. 310, 312), a Warrior, an
Archer, a Lance-holder, a Hunter, a Giant (Cf. lb. p.
254), a Water-pourer, a Sailor, a Charioteer ; or,
again, as a Ram (Cf. lb. 53), a Goat (Cf. lb. 80,
218-19), a Horse, a Lion (Cf. lb. 62-3), an Eagle Cf. lb. 45), or a Fish (Cf. lb. 86-7). Such facts
require no further proof here ; they are merely
mythological commonplaces. 'We may observe, by the way,' remarks Count Goblet D'Alviella,
' that the
horse, and the cock, as well as the eagle, and the lion,
are essentially solar animals' (The Migration of Symbols, p. 58). And he further notes that 'in the
mythology of primitive nations the contest between
the sky, or sun, and the clouds is frequently repre
sented by a fight between an eagle and a serpent' (lb. p. 17). Here we meet with the solar Snake
holder. The Lion, king of beasts, the Eagle, king of



XVl] THE GENERAL CONCEPTS. 225
birds, the Dolphin, king of fishes (Cf. Vol. I. 248), are all specially sacred to the solar hero, whose most
familiar mythological opponent is Darkness, appearing either as Night, Storm - cloud or Eclipse, in size
gigantic and in appearance chaotic. With this are
closely connected Cold and Winter, and Autumn, the
season when the light begins to fade quickly and the
cold increases. As light and warmth are, on the
whole, far more pleasant than darkness and cold, so
the opponent of the solar hero takes a monstrous and
horrid form and is portrayed as a Dragon, huge
Serpent, Scorpion (Cf. Vol. I. 67 et seq.), etc. The Moon, again, is naturally connected with the Bull, Ox
and Cow (Cf. lb. 56, 227), and is certainly also most
closely connected with the Hare (Cf. lb. p. 97).
These facts enable us to understand that the great
majority of the primitive constellation-figures had a
pre-constellational history ; and were in fact forms and phases of thought familiar to the mind of early
man before he had entered upon the task of stellar
uranography. This is why he selected them for their
present positions ; for, as we have seen all along, and as even a cursory examination of the starry heavens
will convince any reasonable person, the stars them
selves, with certain exceptions which will be noticed, do not in their natural configuration resemble the
forms in which they have been grouped, or where
there may be any slight resemblance it is equally
shared by a hundred other objects which have never
been constellation-figures. Writers have often told
us, speaking merely from the depths of their ignor
ance, how ' Chaldean shepherds
' were wont to gaze
upon the brilliant nocturnal sky, and to imagine that
such and such stars resembled this or that figure. VOL. II. 15



226 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XVI
But all this is merely the old effort to make capital
out of nescience, and the stars are before our eyes to
prove the contrary. Having already certain fixed
ideas and figures in his mind, the constellation-framer, when he came to his task, applied his figures to the
stars and the stars to his figures as harmoniously as
possible. Thus, nearly each primitive constellationfigure is a reduplication of an idea connected with
simpler natural phenomena, solar, lunar, or as the case may be. The solar Earn reappears in Aries, the
lunar Bull in Taurus, and thus on ; and such being
the general concepts underlying most of the primitive constellations, we have next to notice the manner in
which these very early mythological imaginings were
practically applied to the stellar expanse.



CHAPTER XVII.
The Formation of the Primitive Constellations.
We have lastly to observe, in some detail, the application of the foregoing ideas and principles to the
actual configuration of the stellar host ; a compara
tively easy task, since we have now ascertained, on the one hand, the names of the principal Euphratean
stars and constellations, and, on the other, the method and line of thought which practically obtained in the
formation of star-groups. As of course, the eye of early man, like that of man to-day, when lifted to the
glowing vault, fell first upon the brightest individual stars ; and next noted their association with each
other, especially in pairs, threes and sevens. As the
ecliptic constituted the region of primary importance, and as the sun and moon, in their courses, had im
periously connected it with the numbers two and
twelve, we will first consider the grouping of the
ecliptic constellations ; premising that the observation
of single stars is, as of course, prior to their being
grouped together in an imaginary whole, just as e.g., in matters terrestrial, York existed before Yorkshire.
If we find that a great number of the constellation
figures are solar reduplications, and if anyone should be inclined to regard such a fact as, in the abstract,
improbable, let us illustrate the circumstance by an
example taken from heraldry. The Sun did not
monopolize the Signs to anything like the extent that



2 28 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XV
his famous emblem the Lion monopolized armorial
bearings at one time. ' It may be a matter of some
surprise,' says Planch e,
' to learn that in the twelfth
century but one beast is to be seen on the shields of
any of the great Anglo-Norman nobility ; that one being a Lion. The Earls of Arundel, Lincoln, Leices
ter, Shrewsbury, Pembroke, Salisbury, and Hereford all bear Lions/ In the abstract, it was far more
improbable that the w7hole of these persons should
adopt this one emblem than that the sun, by far the
most important object in nature, should, in his varied
aspects, occupy so much of the thoughts of archaic man. I will next briefly take the primitive constella
tion-figures in order, and indicate, as nearly as may be, the principles which obtained in their several
formations.
I. The Ram. The stars being regarded as ' a
heavenly flock' (Vide Vol. I. 287), the star which
opens the year is naturally their leader. When the
year commenced in Aries the star Hamal necessarily
had this position, and opened the year as the Eam-sun
opened the day (Vide lb. 53-4). Hence, the Ram is
a solar reduplication. The stars which compose it have no actual resemblance to this animal ; but the
natural line of thought indicates the reason of the
choice. Fig. IV. shows how the stars of the constella
tion were ultimately grouped in accordance with the
animal shape ; and this illustration applies practically
to almost every constellation-figure, except to the very few in which there is a striking natural resemblance
between the form portrayed and the actual arrange
ment of the stars. First we have the Ram as a
single star, Hamal (a Arietis) ; then a Ram-con
stellation, consisting of a, (3 and y Arietis (Vide sujx



XVIl] FORMATION OF PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. 229
p. 72) ; and, ultimately, when it is thought necessary that the constellation should be spread as far as
possible over the ecliptic, we arrive at the figure of
the Hipparcho-Ptolemaic Aries. At last, modern
astronomy, for purposes of reference and description, divides the entire heaven between the constellations,

including in the Ram various stars which form no
part of its figure. Thus, we see, from first to last,
the origin, progress and ultimate result of the idea
connected with a primitive constellation ; and, in
going through the list, the reader will find exactly the same principles at work in almost every instance.
II. The Bull. Originally the first of the zodiacal



23O PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XVII
Signs, the Bull is a lunar reduplication (Vide Vol. I. 56-7). In this case the configuration of the stars
aptly coincides with the lunar idea (Vide Fig. V. ;
Vol. I. 128-9); and the original constellation, prob

ably consisting of the Hyades only, is naturally
enlarged to its present proportions. As the Bull
originally preceded the Ram, so Sin, the Moon-god, is at times described as the sire of Samas, the Sun
god, night preceding day. Fig. VI. well illustrates the lunar Bui] (Vide lb. 227-8).
The alternation of day and night
apparently suggested that the con
stellation-figures of the Zodiac should be alternately drawn from diurnal and nocturnal sources. Hence it The Lunar Bull. will be found that Arie^ Qeminif

XVIl] FORMATION OF PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. 23 1
This fact, the reason of which must have been un
known for very many centuries, has been faithfully
preserved by astrology down to the present time (Vide
R. B. Jr., Sem. Sec. XXVII. ; Cf. Bouchd-Leclercq,
L'Astrol. Grecque, 155 et seq.). III. The Twins. On the above principle the third
constellation-figure had to be drawn from a diurnal source. The two great
stars Castor and Pollux, side by side,
which alone formed the original con
stellation, at once suggested the original
' Twin Brethren,' Sun and Moon, only
seen together by day. As one rises the other sets, a fact quaintly shown on
the cylinders (Vide Fig. VII. ; Vol. I. 58-9, 291-2). As in other cases, the constellation was in time extended, so
as to cover the space between the end
of the Bull's horns and the Crab.
IV. The Crab. Next suitably came
a very dark portion of the ecliptic, which was assigned to the Crab, a
variant of the Scorpion and Tortoise
(Vide Vol. I. 60, 145, 209-11), and an FlG viL The emblem of Darkness, which seizes, Great Twins.
swallows or, again, guards the light and (From a Cylin

er*'
V. The Lion. The brilliant stars of the Sickle
which succeed, and which are also connected with the
hottest period of the year, were naturally and very
suitably appropriated to the Lion, a reduplication of the leonine Sun (Vide Vol. I. 62-3). From the Sickle
the constellation enlarged until it included Denebola.
VI. The Virgin. The succeeding Sign was bound

to be a nocturnal one, but the succeeding stars are
bright, five of them /3, rj,
7, S and e Virginis form
ing a lunar crescent. As in Taurus we have the
Moon-god, so here we have the Moon-goddess ;
and, connecting, as is natural, the crescent with
the upper part of her person, the brilliant star
Ear -of- corn is conse
quently placed in her hand. In V. I have
demonstrated that this
was also a love-emblem,
and have given many illustrations showing
the goddess holding it
(Vide Fig. VIII. Vide also Vol. I. 64-6, 227).
VII. The Altar. The stars of
the immediately succeeding portion of the Zodiac are compara
tively faint, but the Sign had to be a diurnal one. Hence, as the
season of autumn had arrived, the
feeble waning Sun was aptly re
duplicated in the dim stars of
the circular Altar, grasped in the
huge Claws of the Scorpion (Vide Fig. IX.). Sometimes the solar
Circle or Altar is represented as a
Lamp (Vide Fig. X. Vide also Vol. I. 67-71, 217).
VIII. The Scorpion. The succeeding Sign had to

XVIl] FORMATION OF PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. 2 OJ
be a nocturnal one ; and, as in the case of the Bull,
the stars lent themselves very readily to the forma
tion of an appropriate figure, namely, the Scorpion, a familiar emblem of Darkness (Vide Fig. XL, Vol. I.
67-76). IX. The Archer. The succeeding Sign had to be

a diurnal one, and the configuration of the stars
readily suggests a Bow, and hence an Archer, Sagit
tarius being a reduplication of the racing Archer-sun
(Vide Fig. XII. ; Vol. I. 77-9).
X. The Goat. We now reach the watery expanse and Region of Ea, where the weather also of the time
of year suggests an aqueous reign. The Sign has to



234 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XVII
be a diurnal one, the stars at this portion of the
ecliptic are dim, and their natural arrangement is not connected with any specific animal figure. What the
season suggests is the youthful Sun of winter climb
ing out of the abyss of darkness, night and the deep ; and as both the Goat and Fish were already
solar emblems, they are naturally combined in the



XVIl] FORMATION OF PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. 235
form of the Goat-fish (Yide Fig. XIII. ; Vol. I.
80-1).
XL The Water-pourer. The next Sign, also belong

ing specially to a rainy season and watery region, had to be a diurnal one ; and hence became appropriated
to the Kain-giving-sun,
represented by his waterpouring Urn (Vide Vol. I. 84-5). Here nothing
was suggested by the
natural configuration of the stars.
XII. The Fishes, ori
ginally the Fish. This
dark and nocturnal Sign
of the watery region, in which the actual arrange
ment of the stars suggests no particular form, was
aptly allotted to the Fish, a reduplication of the
Fig. XIII. The Euphratean Goat-fish.



236 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XVII
solar Fish, as hidden in the depths of ocean and
the Under-world (Vide Vol. I. 86-8). Hence, on
analysis, the zodiacal Signs present us with the Sun
as Earn, Twin, Lion, Daily sacrificed and Dying, Archer, Rain-giving, Oceanic and Nocturnal ; with
the Moon, as male and female, Bull and Goddess ;
and with Darkness, morning and evening, in two variant emblems. Here we obtain an intelligible
evolution of stellar imagery ; we can see the reason
why. The result was not the outcome of an arbitrary
fancy, but the continued application of ideas which
arose naturally, and almost necessarily, in the mind
of early man.
XIII. The Northern Constellation-figures. Although our knowledge of the extra-zodiacal portion of the
Euphratean celestial sphere is less than the acquaintance which we possess with the Zodiac, yet we know
quite enough to see that exactly the same principles obtained in the formation of the extra-zodiacal con
stellation-figures. The Pole-star, as of course, stands alone as a sacred unit, whilst the seven prominent
stars of the Great Bear form a Chariot naturally
enough, and are reduplicated in the seven stars of the
Lesser Bear. These two heavenly Chariots guard
the Pole (Vide Vol. I. 268-9). The solar shepherd is
reduplicated in Arcturus-Bootes, the stars of which
easily adapt themselves to a human form, another reason of the choice being that Arcturus is the
brightest star of the Northern Hemisphere (Vide Vol. I. 279-85). The contest of the Sun-god with Storm
and Cloud is reduplicated in the figures of the Kneeler, the Arrow, and the three Birds (Vide Vol. 1. 34-5,
132, 234-5), and if the reader will refer to the Map of
the Northern Hemisphere (Vol. I. 119), he will see



XVIl] FORMATION OF PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. 237
how in these, and in various other, instances the
natural configuration of the stars was adapted to
portray the forms desired. 1 As the Dolphin is
the head of fish (Vide Vol. I. 248), so the solar
Dolphin (Vide lb. 46-7) reappears amongst the -constellations in a group of stars which stood alone
between the Arrow and Birds on the one hand, and
the figure of the solar sea Horse (Vide lb. 48, 200-2),
on the other. It is obvious that these forms, the
stars adjusting themselves readily to the shape of a
demi-horse, were depicted prior to that of the Dolphin, for which a small unformed group of stars was
subsequently utilized. We have seen reason to
believe that many of the stars near the Pole were
specially called the Flock (Vide sup. p. 20) ; whilst
certain other stellar groups, Cassiepeia, Cepheus, Andromeda, Perseus and Auriga were so combined
as to represent human figures (Vide Map), which of
course served for the figures of divinities, Euphratean
and Phoenician. The Triangle (Vide Vol. I. 50-52)
and the Crown (lb. 32-3) are natural shapes, which
nevertheless were intimately connected with the
religion and mythology of the Constellation-framers.
The idea of a snake-holding divinity (Vide sup. p.
224) is easily portrayed by the stars of Serpentarius} as is that of a huge Serpent by those of Draco ;
but, here, as in every other instance, a previous line of thought is illustrated. The Constellation-framer is
not satisfied merely to see in Serpentarius a stellar
1 The Eagle was also a solar figure (Vide sup. p. 224). The reason of this double aspect is partly the fact that the Sun, when flashing
through stormy clouds, can be regarded (1) as fighting against them, or (2) as a Storm-sun and Storm-god, using them as his
weapons.



238 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XVII
picture of a man holding a snake. He already had in
his mental religious idea the concept of a god holding
a snake, either contending with it or, again, employing
it peacefully ; and to this thought he gave form and expression. Of the line of thought connected with the
Bears (Vide Vol. I. 256 et seq.), and of certain
northern constellation-figures in Phoenician idea, I
have already fully spoken.
XIV. The Southern Constellation-figures. When the constellation-framer turned his gaze towards the
stars of the Southern Hemisphere he would at once
see in the splendid group of Orion (Vide Vol. I. 92-3 ;
253-6) a southern solar shepherd or hunter corre
sponding to Bootes in the north. And as the Euph
ratean solar hunter was accompanied by his dogs, so
his stellar reduplication was represented as being
accompanied by a pair of Dogs (Vide lb. 275-9), the seven prominent stars of the Greater Dog easily
grouping themselves into the figure of a dog salient
or on its hind legs, an attitude which has always been
retained in delineations of this constellation-figure
(Vide Fig. XIV.). But, as stars were noticed ere con
stellations were formed, Sirius and Procyon were the
two original Dog-stars. The constellation of the
Hare (Vide lb. 97-8) has not yet been found upon the monuments ; but as the animal is a singularly
widely spread lunar type, and as its stars are those
immediately chased by the Dogs, it is probable that the Hare was a Euphratean constellation, and that
the whole group is a stellar reduplication of the chase
of the Moon by the Sun. As there is not the slightest
resemblance between the stars of the Hare and the
animal, the idea of a lunar hare being in the mind of
the constellation-framer, he would arbitrarily apply



XVIl] FORMATION OF PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. 239
the stars to the figure or the figure to the stars. The
solar Ship is so familiar a mythological subject that
we should expect to meet a reduplication of it, especially in the land of the Deluge-story ; and therefore
we are not surprised to find an Argo amongst the
constellations, though of what stars it was originally
Fig. XIV. The Dog. (From a Boundary Stone.)
composed is uncertain (Vide Vol. I. 101-3). The Storm-and-darkness -monster, connected also with the
vastness of the enringing serpentine Ocean found a
natural heavenly location in the vast dark space
beneath the Zodiac and under Perseus and Andro
meda, occupied by the Sea-monster (Vide lb. 89-91) ; and, in its second form, in the tremendous length of
the Water-snake (Vide lb. 104-6.). No reasonable



24O PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XVII
person, acquainted with the representations of the Great Snake on the monuments (Vide sup. p. 34)
can well deny that the constellation-framer in arbi
trarily (so far as natural shape is concerned) linking together stars from Cancer to Libra in the form of a
serpent, was making a stellar reduplication of an idea already familiar to his mind ; whilst the Kretan coins
and the legends referring to the great contest of the
Sun-god with the Crab and the Water-snake, show
how faithfully the myth and its stellar reduplication
were propagated in the West (Vide Vol. I. 144-6). The two remarkable clusters of stars immediately
north of the Water-snake and very closely connected
with it, naturally received names, Bowl and Crow, which, as we have seen, were connected with the
Tiamat cycle of ideas and personages (Vide lb. 106-9). As I have frequently had occasion to observe,
nothing is more remarkable than the quite insignifi
cant part played by pure invention in the progress
of human thought. We meet with continuous bor
rowing and reduplication. Even Nature, as Emerson
well says,
' hums her old tunes with innumerable
variations.' And this feature is most strikingly
evident in the case of the constellation-figures. Not
only are the original types reduplications of prior ideas, but the leading figures, when once formed, are
frequently simply reproduced in slightly variant phase. Thus, the Southern Fish (Vide lb. 115-17), the Altar
(Vide lb. 67, 180, 216-18) and the Centaur owe nothing to the natural formation of the stars, but are
merely reproductions of the original Piscis of the Zodiac, of the original Altar of the Zodiac, and of the Archer of the Zodiac. The stars near the Centaur
(Vide lb. 110-11) permitted the introduction of a



XVIlJ FORMATION OF PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. 24 1
-The Centaur and the Wild-Beast.
further figure, the Wild-beast (Vide lb. 112), which,
originally forming part of the constellation, showed the triumph of the Sun-god alike over the Beast of
darkness and over his own solar Lion (Figs. XV., XVI. ).
This, as already no
ticed (Vide lb. 214), was an early feature
in the art of Western
Asia, and one which
was carefully reproduced in Hellas. In
the case of the Stream
(Vide lb. 95-9), the Fig. XV
remaining primitive constellation, the constellation -fram er immortalized
several ideas. The Ocean-stream, the Milky-way, and
Euphrates, king of rivers, are all concerned here. It
will be observed that the actual configuration of the
stars exactly carries
out the idea ; but it
was by no accident
that these particular stars were selected to
depict jfiridanos. On
its bank stands the doomed and luckless

monster is advancingo.
The solar hero is everlastingly victorious and defeated
near the Ocean-stream ; in a word he is PerseusTammuz.
Such, then, were the principles which obtained in
the formation of the primitive constellations. Eelivol. 11. 16



242 PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. [XVII
gious and mythological ideas, already long current and venerated, were stamped upon the sky as sacred and celestial forms. The natural arrangement of the stars
was utilized as much as possible in connexion with
certain instances, but had no wider influence than has
onomatopeia in the science of language (Vide lb. 128). The same leading ideas were repeated in numerous
cases, until at length the heavenly sphere was as fully
completed as seemed necessary for practical purposes, it being reserved for modern science to map out the
entire heavens, and thus to complete uranography.
The system so formulated in the Euphrates Valley was accepted and adopted by Western Asia. The
constellations of Israelite and Phoenician were those of
Babylonian and Assyrian, even as Bel reappeared as Baal and Istar as Ashtoreth. Whenever we find a
Phoenician constellation-figure we see in it the exact
prototype of the corresponding figure in the Greek
sphere (Vide sup. p. 50). And here my present task ends. I claim to have demonstrated that the Euph
rates Valley was the main source whence were derived
the primitive constellations of the Greeks. I claim,
further, to have shown the natural line of idea which
produced the constellation -figures ; and although the research of the future will doubtless greatly add to
the mass of material available for the further elucida
tion of the subject, and will enable us to correct many
errors in detail and to explain many circumstances and
incidents now obscure and perplexing, yet I am not
afraid that the principles maintained in this work and
the general conclusions now arrived at, will be unable
to stand the influx of more light from the East.

and that its gate
' opens towards the same four quarters. Subartu
(Cf. K. 694, 1. 9), otherwise Su-edin or Sutu (Vide Delitzsch,
Paradies, pp. 234-5), lay east of the Diglat (Tigris) and north of Kltlm, and stands for the North generally. Amurru (Vide sup. p.
160) is literally Amorite '-land, = the West. It is thus stated that what I may call ' the sweet influences ' of Sugi towards plenty, were directed at different times through its
gates to the lands of the Four Quarters. We here meet with an archaic instance of the idea of stellar gates, which afterwards became so familiar ; especially in the case of ' Capricornus et
Cancer . . . solis portas' (Macrob. Comment, in Som. Scip. I. xii.
1). Other Classical stellar gates were ' Unam ad signum Scofjnonis, alteram per limitem qui est inter Leonem et Cancrum; tertium esse inter Aquarium et Pisces 7
(Varro, ap. Servius, in Georg.
i. 3W4)e. have seen (Sup. p. 40) that the great Goat-stsu, Sum. Askar, Ph. Aiz, Gk. Aix, Lat. Capella, which stands above Sugi, marked the new year at a time prior to B.C. 2540, when the Pleiad was
specially connected with the vernal equinox (Vide Vol. I. 56-7,
156). We noticed further, that, according to archaic Chinese astronomy, which was Bab. in origin, the name for the Pleiad was written 'sun open door,' and that there was a path, that of the ecliptic, between the Pleiades and the Hyades (lb. p. 275). This^ then, was the western gate of Sugi, open towards Amurru. Thus,
Sugi is specially connected with the glad fertility of spring. But the great Goat-stav is also in Bab. Iqu (' the Gate '-star. Sup.
p. 208) ; for what is Babylon herself but Ka-dingira (' the Gate-of
the-gods'),=Sem. Bab-ili. Hence, the path by Askar-IqH to the heights of the North, where the pair of Chariots guard the sacred Pole, is the northern gate of Sugi, open in idea towards Subartu.
And Sugi, as noticed (Sup. p. 208), is the Mar-urbi (' Chariot-byitself.' Ak. Urbi= Sem. Istenis, vide Briinnow, Class. List, p. 457), as opposed to the other two Chariots, the Mar-gidda and *Mar-turra, which lie together. The southern gate of Sugi is formed by the Ak. Ka-sil ('Open
ing-of-the-Gate '), Bab. Kuzallu, As. Kusallu, Ph. Kesil, with the
Ph. meaning 'Strong' (Vide Star-map, Vol. I. \\), = Orion (Vide Hommel, ap. Muss-Arnolt, Diet. p. 415).
The eastern gate of Sugi is formed by Castor and Pollux on the
north and Procyon on the south ; and is similarly styled a gate of heaven in the archaic Chinese astronomy (Vide Lacouperie, Western
Origin, p. 301). The ecliptic passes between these points, as
between the Pleiades and Hyades. I am very far from understand

ing the full significance of the Tab., but in these matters we must
proceed by degrees. At every step in the investigation of matters
Euphratean we meet with fresh evidence of how much the world has borrowed from the Land of the Two Rivers. Line 18 of the Tab., unfortunately broken off at both ends,
speaks of Napis-tu Ummdn-Manda (' The life of the Tribal Hordes,' vide sup, p. 100), about whom we would fain know more. The same expression occurs in W. A. 1. III. lx. 35. Line 1 9 reads . . .

that year [(towards) Akkad ']. Lines 20-22 similarly connected the north-gate (whether of Sugi or not, I am not certain) with Subartu ; the east-gate with Elam, and the west-gate with Amurru.
Page 224. The Solar-eagle and tJie Cloud-serpent.
An excellent illustration of the above-quoted dictum of Count
Goblet D'Alviella, is supplied by the Bab. story of the Eagle and the -Serpent, which is partly contained in Tabs. K. 1547 and K.
2d27, and has been translated by Mr. L. W. King. The Eagle determines to eat the young of the Serpent, and will not listen to
one of his eaglets who, ' abounding in wisdom,' warns him against the evil deed, which is certain to provoke the vengeance of the Sun
god, lord of justice. The Eagle devours the young of the Serpent, and the latter complains to the Sun-god, who bids him hide himself in the belly of a dead ox, and seize the Eagle when he descends to
eat the flesh : 26. Into the midst when he has entered, do thou seize him by his wing, tear off his wings, his pinions, and his claws. 28. ' Pull him in pieces and cast him into a pit, a death from
hunger and thirst let him die.' So said, so done. The eaglet in
vain warns his sire against the trap, and the Eagle, when caught,
vainly endeavours to propitiate the Serpent with a gift. The
Serpent ' tore off his wings, his pinions (and) his talons, pulled him
in pieces and cast him into a pit. A death from hunger and thirst
he died.' The Sun-god, as lord of justice, is of course quite distinct in idea
from the solar photosphere, the Eagle of the story, who, having destroyed the little clouds (=the young of the Serpent), at even descends to the earth, and is there seized. His wings and talons (=rays) are torn off, and he is cast into the 'pit' of the Underworld. There is nothing in the natural habits of these creatures to explain the circumstances. The Serpent does not bite or poison

the Eagle, but acts towards him in a non-natural way ; but in a manner which the basis of the myth requires. Nor, again, did anyone sit down and invent this tale out of his own head. It was
suggested to him by natural phenomena.
A
fx.v06s 7raXato5 such as this, passes, as Gubernatis has shown, from land to land, the animals (I use the word in a covering sense) being altered in accordance with the region. This very talc
reappears in Archilochos, in the 7th century B.C. Unfortunately nearly all of it is lost, just as the Bab. account is by no means perfect; but the portion of the Gk. version which remains, is sufficient to enable us to detect its parentage. It is contained in
Frags, lxxxvi.-lxxxviii. of Bergk's edit., and has been translated by
Mr. F. Brooks, from whose rendering I quote : 1 This tale there is among men that a Fox and Eagle made once
upon a time a league together.' This feature does not appear in the Bab. version, as we have it, but was almost certainly contained in the original. The Serpent is described as the Eagle's ' companion,' as the clouds are the com
panions of the sun. The Eagle, having treacherously devoured the cubs of the Fox, retires to a 'lofty crag,' on which, he says, 'I sit making light of thy warefare.' The Fox then appeals to Zeus,
exclaiming : ' Father Zeus, thine is the lordship of heaven, . . . and to thee
the wrong-doing of beasts and its punishment is a care.'
The rest of the story is lost, but doubtless the Eagle, whose
treachery the poet is comparing to that of which he alleges Lykambes to be guilty, came in for condign punishment. Zeus replaces Samas, as the just judge ; and the Fox is substituted for
the Serpent.

1 Mr. Brown's first volume is an addition to religious mythology. The author treats the
question by " a scientific consideration of the historic course of religious thought." There
is something fascinating in this first part, which leaves thinking readers impatient to
possess the sequel.' Notes and Queries. * This book is characterized by unsparing labour and research, the results of which are
stated very clearly, and with the sensibleness that comes of taking a broad view of things.
The quantity of material brought together to prove the main argument, that Dionysos was
not a deity of Aryan but of Semitic origin, is unparalleled.' Academy.
'To the task of exploring this field Mr. Brown has brought a steady resolution and a
judicial impartiality which deserve all praise. The admission that Semitic thought and
worship exercised some influence on those of the Greeks justifies the attempts to deter
mine, if we can, the character of this influence ; there Mr. Brown has done excellent service.
We think that he has fairly proved his main points, that the idea and worship of
Dionysos are non-Hellenic and Semitic. In the working out of this subject he has brought
together a vast body of most interesting and important matter, and handled it with great
skill. Mr. Brown has fully established his title to our gratitude for a vast amount of solid
work already done.' Saturday Review.

* Le nom de M. Robert Brown, auteur du Gfrand Mythe Dionysiaque, est bien connu

s'est donne" pour tache de determiner la part qui revient a l'influence s^mitique dans la
mythologie grecque, et il a trouve" que cette part etait considerable. II surprend des
traces d'un lament oriental bien caracte'rise' dans les rites, dans les idees, et dans les

' The title hardly suggests to an ordinary person the vast amount of ground which the
author covers. The Dionysiak Myth, in his view, is nothing less than a picture of all the

words, to have been " revealing their own nature and mental basis." Mr. Brown has pro
duced two learned volumes, in which the whole matter and many collateral matters are
elaborately discussed. 'Spectator.
1 Among the numerous works which the constantly-growing interest in archaeology has
called forth, Mr. Brown's treatise will be regarded as entitled to high favour. His labours
will enable us to read our Bibles and ancient classics more understanding^. He has
performed a prodigious deal of hard work, and done it admirably Dionysos has
been selected as the central figure, because his history covers the entire field of research.
Mr. Brown brings to his work the charm of novelty, and even of romance. The thorough
ness, fidelity, and conscientiousness which he displays are most exceptional.' The
Library Table (New York).
' The story is as interesting as a romance to the archaeological inquirer. A profusion
of authors are quoted to facilitate the investigation and to substantiate the conclusions.
It must be acknowledged that they altogether appear to constitute a very satisfactory
explanation.' The Evolution (New York). ' The author of The Great Dionysiak Myth has given a fuller and more interior view of
the fancied grape-god. We are conducted through a world of classical and mythological
research far outside of Olympus, and even of Greece, over Syria, Egypt, Arabia, and the
far Orient.' The Medical Tribune (New York).
' During the twelve years which have passed since the publication of the first edition, a
large amount of solid work has been done within the domain of comparative mythology.
Of the results so gained, probably the most important is the clearer light thrown on the
influence of Semitic theology on the theology and religion of the Greeks. This momentous
question I have striven to treat impartially ; and for my treatment of it I have to acknow
ledge my obligations to Mr. Robert Brown's valuable researches in the field of the great
Dionysiak Myth.' Rev. Sir G. W. Cox, Preface to the new edition of The Mythology of the

1 Mr. Brown has put together in a very clever and compact form the different theories
that have been set forth of late years as to the origin of language. He has gone to the
best authorities, and shows a wide extent of reading. At the same time he exercises an
independent judgment in regard to the theories he describes, freely criticising those from
which he differs. We can thoroughly recommend the pamphlet.' A cademy. ' The admirable pamphlet of Mr. Brown on the origin of language.' Professor Forbes (Aberdeen). ' Both interesting and valuable.' Professor Alfred Marshall (Cambridge).

' A charming little book, full of learning and instruction.' Professor SAYCE.
'A delightful excursion into fairyland.' J. E. Taylor, F.l.s., etc. etc., Editor of Science Gossip.
' Mr. Brown has given us a pleasant, instructive, and original little book. It was a
happy thought to impress heraldry into the service of mythology, and show how the
arms of .England are the last embodiment of an old Aryan legend. Mr. Brown brings
together a vast amount of apt illustration to prove his case. In reading his book we
cannot but be struck by the abundant stores of solid learning it displays and the attempt
of the author always to refer to the latest and best authorities. We are led easily and
pleasantly on from one point to another, beginning with the art of primaeval Babylonia,
and ending with the Scottish unicorn, introduced by James I., as the sinister supporter of
the royal arms. We must not forget to notice the Scandinavian unicorn, carved on the
horn of Ulf, which appropriately fornis the frontispiece of the volume.' A cademy.
' Mr. Brown has collected his facts from the latest and best authorities, and displays a
wonderful amount of wide reading.' Nature.



THE LAW OF KOSMIC ORDER.
AN INVESTIGATION OF THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF TIME. Ss.
' Mr. Brown comes to the conclusion that the year was regarded by the Aecadians as an
extended nycthemaron, half the signs being diurnal or relating to the deities of day, and
the other half being nocturnal, concerned with myths of the night. Early man thus
recognized that there was one and the same law of "Kosmic Order" pervading all con
ceptions of time. In the course of his investigation Mr. Brown draws upon Egyptian and
Iranian sources, but his chief materials are necessarily derived from the monuments of
ancient Babylonia We can thoroughly recommend his interesting book to those
who care to study a curious chapter in primitive astronomy.' Nature.
' The author of The Great Dionysiak Myth is a laborious student. It seems but yester
day that we noticed his pamphlet on the unicorn, and now we have another book which
must have taken, one would suppose, years of study to bring it to its present state of
perfection To us moderns, however ignorant we may be, the idea of time is
regulated by a multitude of events of daily and almost hourly occurrence, and but very few
of us ever look back to a period when it had to be worked out bit by bit. Mr. Brown has
done this thoroughly well in his own deeply learned fashion The book is an
important contribution to science, which no future investigator in the same field can
afford to overlook.' Notes and Queries. 1 By Kosmic Order Mr. Brown means " The harmony of the world in its varied round of
day, night, week, month, season, and year." His present work is an attempt to point out
the way in which man attained to an idea of this order, so far as the year and zodiacal
signs are concerned. It is more especially with the zodiacal signs as we have received
them from the Greeks that he concerns himself. They were ultimately derived from the
Aecadians, who first mapped out the sun's course through the sky, and gave to each
section of it the names by which the signs are still, for the most part, known. Mr. Brown
claims to have shown that the signs, when the mythological conceptions which lie at the
bottom of them are examined, fall naturally into two groups, six being diurnal and six
nocturnal. In this way the year became to early men the day of twenty-four (or rather
twelve) hours on an enlarged scale. We always find in Mr. Brown's writings proofs of
wide reading and happy suggestions. There are very few of his statements with which
we should be disposed to quarrel, and the general reader cannot fail to find his work
both instructive and interesting.' Academy.

1 In reading this brochure, one almost stands aghast at the amount of erudition and the
extent of research that have been employed in its construction ; while the marvellous
ingenuity with which the author has pieced together so many seemingly unconnected
facts drawn from so many various sources, into a logical and convincing series of argu
ments, all leading to the same conclusion, is not less striking.' Scotsman.
' In this study Mr. Brown gives us more of that extensive learning and power of com
bination which we|have come to expect from him as a matter of right It is

. . Mr. Brown has done good work . . . and has in particular made much progress in
the identification of the Babylonian constellations with the Greek.' Academy.
' Into the midst of the battle of the three principal directions of Mythological Science
in England, the Author leads us with lively and often delightful humour. Max Miiller
has put together his thoughts concerning language, myth and religion in the Contributions
to the Science of Mythology, 1897. The Arians had before their separation, a formulated
belief in divinities, in which they embodied the great natural phenomena, namely the
Solar. Once more does Andrew Lang, his old adversary, fight him in his [Lang's] Modern
Mythology, with the insufficient weapons of his known anthropological theory. Though
Brown declares himself full of respect for the former and finishes off the latter with
sharp humour, still he blames Miiller for several weaknesses; and, more especially, as a
principal fault, for his disinclination to admit that so many Hellenic divinities and
mythical stories can be explained by Semitic influence. Most certainly the powerful
Semitic cult-centre on the Euphrates carried forward an influence more clearly seen year
by year from new discoveries, not only on domestic life and knowledge, but also on the
belief of Hellas. Brown recognizes Semitic extraction in a Greek divinity (1) If the name
and its principal myths do not appear in the other Arian mythologies ; (2) If Arian nature
myths provide no simple and appropriate explanation of its existence ; (3) If its cult is
found in territory either non-Arian, or governed by non-Arian influence; (4) When the
form is more or less unanthropomorphic ; (5) When the character and history harmonize
with the character and history of non-Arian divinities ; and (6) When Arian philology is
not in a position to explain its name, and some or most of its principal features. Thus
does he explain Kronos, Poseidon, Dionysos, Aphrodite and Herakles as Semitic beings :
but further, also Ino, Athamas = Tammuz, Kirke, Hekate, the Ilian Athene, the picture
of the Under-world Nekyia, and the Greek constellations. 'Anzeiger fur lndogermanische

PRIMITIVE CONSTELLATIONS. VOL. I.
'Comparisons and identifications which are very suggestive.' Literature.
' Mr. Brown has long been known as a most diligent student of astronomical archae
ology, and his translation of Aratus, with the notes accompanying it, was highly valued
by all who take an interest in the early history of astronomy. The object of his present
work is to trace back the constellations as near as can be to the time and place of their
origin. That place Mr. Brown finds to be the Valley of the Euphrates, and the earliest
people to which he is at present able to follow them are the Akkadians. The present
volume is chiefly occupied with a translation of the star catalogue of the Almagest, and
with establishing that the early Greek writers, and Homer in particular, were well
acquainted with the constellation figures. Much of this is thoroughly pioneer work in
a region of extreme interest and no little importance, and Mr. Brown is the first person
who has carried it on with anything like the same system and labour. His scholarship is
wide, his industry is inexhaustible. Our debt to him is great . . . The book shows
immense learning and research.' Journal of the British Astronomical Society.
'All must agree that Mr. Brown has done good service by his translation of, and com
mentary on the works of Aratus, and he has brought a vast amount of learning and
ingenious suggestion to bear on this exposition of his views.' Folk-lore.
' There is much to support the view that the constellations in something like their
present form originated in the lands through which the Euphrates runs perhaps as early
as 2000-3000 B.C., and that a knowledge of them passed to the Greeks long afterwards.
It is one of the forms of this theory that Mr. Brown champions in the book before us with
great learning and enthusiasm.' Saturday Review.
'Mr. Brown's labours undoubtedly belong to the region of genuine scientific research.
The writer is neither a sciolist nor a learned man whose imagination has run away with
him. He has always a reason for what he thinks, and to the best of our judgment, gener
ally a good reason. . . . His work may be recommended to the study even of those who
may take little interest in the history of the constellations as a peculiarly instructive and
convincing illustration of the close intellectual connection of the chief nations of the
ancient world, and of the extent to which Greece was influenced by Babylonia.' The Speaker.
'It is beyond dispute that Mr. Brown's books, and the present one in particular, have
a very high value . . . The present book stands out as the most serious and scientific
attempt yet published to trace the old constellation figures back to their origin. Mr.
Brown traces the primitive constellations of the Greeks those, that is to say, that are
described for us in the Phainomena of Aratos back to the early inhabitants of the
Euphratean Valley, and particularly to the Akkadians, from whom the Greeks derived
them through the Phoenicians, the Hittites, and the later (Semitic) Babylonians . . .
There can be little doubt that, so far as there is evidence at present available, he proves his point.' Knowledge.
'Mr. Brown places in a connected form the result of the investigations of many years
respecting the employment of the Signs of the Zodiac and of the other time honoured
constellation figures of the classical world. The translation of the star list is accom
panied by notes showing the connection of the majority of the constellation figures with
Phoenicia and the Euphrates Valley.' Literary World.



1 Astronomy is probably one of the very oldest of sciences ; its origin is lost in tlie most
remote antiquity, and we do not even know how or when the constellation figures were
developed, although these indicate a very advanced stage of astronomical knowledge.
Mr. R. Brown has just published the first volume of a series of scholarly researches Into
the history of the Primitive Constellations, which contains a mass of information upon
the state of astronomical science in Babylon and Greece. In opposition to some previous
inquirers, the author considers that the ancient astronomers did not group the stars in
the shape of certain figures because their grouping resembled these figures, but that they
first selected the figures, and then arranged the stars within their outlines. Much evi
dence is given in support of this view, especially from the flipparcho-Ptolemy star-list
and Greek literature generally. There seems every reason to believe that the Greeks
obtained their knowledge of constellations and astronomy generally from Asia, especially
the region of the Euphrates. Mr. Brown's work contains an enormous number of classical
references and can be confidently recommended to all those interested in this subject.'
Westminster Review.
'The present volume is mainly concerned with the Hellenic history of the signs,
including their place in the art of the various nations with whom the earlier Greeks came
into contact, and concludes with a notice of the Gra:co-Babylonian period of Seleucus and
his successors. In a second it is proposed to trace the constellation figures backwards
from the era of Alexander to their first appearance in the dawn of history. Mr. Brown
has gone into the matter very elaborately and with great wealth of illustration, which
cannot fail to render his work of high interest to the student of ancient literature and
science.' Notes and Queries.
'So much has been done now in the publication of Babylonian and other tablets that
it is possible to make hopeful research into the primitive astronomy, and to reach con
clusions that are approachably scientific and final. Mr. Brown claims no more than that.
But he claims that, and makes it good. He has no revolutionary theories ; his work is on
the lines of the great scholars ; but he is original and painstaking, making actual new con
tributions to the subject. Moreover, he has succeeded in retaining the reader's interest
throughout, no doubt by the simple process of being always interested himself. This
volume is the first of two. It carries the history of the constellations through the Hellenic
period. The second will trace the Signs from the age of Alexander back to the dawn of
history a period of deeper and yet more difficult interest.' Expository Times.
' Many years of laborious and conscientious study must have gone to the collection and
sifting of the facts with which his pages are crammed. One chapter is devoted to showing
that the Stellar Catalogue of Ptolemy contained in his " Almagest," is practically an edition
of the earlier Star List of Hipparchos, and to a transcription and elaborate examination
of the list, with the object of identifying the constellations therein contained with figures
in classical, Phoenician, and Babylonian mythology ... A fruitful field of corroborative
evidence and illustration is found in the Greek coins and in Homeric references, all
pointing back, as the author holds, to an origin in the primitive civilization in the
Euphrates Valley. 'Scotsman. ' The author has in previous works established his right to be heard as the exponent of
an intelligent theory of the orgin of myths, differing on the one hand from the solar
theory, mainly associated in this country with the name of Prof. Max Miiller, and on the
other from the folk-lore theory advocated by Mr. A. Lang. He has also in the view of
many good authorities established the intercommunication of myths between the great
races of mankind in a way that not long ago was thought impossible . . . The book is one
of extraordinary erudition.' Glasgow Herald.
' We have little but praise for Mr. Brown's latest contribution to the history of science
and mythology, or of science in its mythological stage a "border-land " on which he moves
with an ease and assurance which we admire. With Mr. Brown's fundamental contention
that a large debt to the Orient is to be recognized in Greek civilization and thought, we
have on previous occasions expressed our general agreement. We gladly recognize that
in the present volume the author has fortified that contention by a careful argument and
a mass of evidence dealing with the origines of Greek astronomical myth and science.
Mr. Brown makes out a strong case for recognizing Babylon as the ultimate source of
much that has passed for original Greek observation, speculation, and construction.'
Manchester Guardian.
' Mr. Brown has devoted himself to this and kindred subjects for years, and in the work,
the first volume of which is before us, the ripest fruits of his years of study will be pre
sented. An enthusiastic student of Greek literature, deeply imbued with Semitic learning,
the author has endeavoured to show in his various works the Semitic influence in Greek
mythology^and life. His services in this field commend him to the regard of a wide circle
of scholars! The book before us increases their debt to him . . . The chapter on Baby
lonian astronomy makes good use of both Greek and cuneiform sources, and gives excel
lent promise for the rest of the work, which Semitic scholars will await with interest.'

' The volume clears up many obscure points. Mr. Brown is a student of great and
varied erudition.' Literary World.
'Full of learning and ingenious and suggestive combinations.' Professor Tiele (Leiden). 'I hail the doctrine that Kirke is Euphratean.' The late Rt. Hon. W. E. Gladstone.
THE PHAINOMENA, OR 'HEAVENLY DISPLAY' OF ARATOS,
Done into English verse.
With an Introduction, Notes, and Appendices, and lxviii
Engravings from rare Works, MSS., Euphratean Boundary
stones, and other sources, of the Constellation-figures and
Mythological Personages mentioned in the Poem ; together with a Folding Map showing in colours the Constellations

4 Mr. Brown's volume should commend itself to all for whom the earliest record of our Constellations possesses any interest.' Knowledge.
'An arduous task could scarcely be accomplished in more scholarly or satisfactory
fashion.' Notes and Queries.
'This translation, without sacrificing fidelity, has preserved the spirit of the original.
The work is profusely adorned with highly interesting illustrations.' The Literary World. ' Mr. Brown has published his neat aud faithful translation in an attractive, not to say
sumptuous form.' The Academy. 'Those who know Mr. Brown's other works will readily believe the actual translation
is the least part of the book; the most important portion consists of the abundant and
valuable notes upon every constellation named. Mr. Brown's erudition and range of
research have received recognition ere now from the highest authorities, and they are
displayed afresh in these interesting notes. Many of the constellations are traced hack
to their Akkadian stage and Mr. Brown's remarks as to the date of the observa
tions upon which the poem of Aratos is founded are very forcible. The book is adorned
with a great number of curious Middle Age or Archaic designs of the constellation
figures.' The Observatory.
A TRILOGY OF THE LIFE-TO-COME,
AND OTHER POEMS. 2S. 6d.
' Very good.' Spectator. ' Extremely felicitous.' The Academy.
' Perhaps the best thing in the book is " Phase II." of the Trilogy, some touches of which
might almost have been given by Shelley Hardly less successful in its way is the
" County Member," which, besides showing Mr. Brown's command over pathos and dialect,
contains a useful lesson for politicians.' Court and Society Review.
TELLIS AND KLEOBEIA. 2s. 6d.
' You have created an exquisite background to those two shadowy figures I do
not think any words of mine will be needed to make known a poem so lovely.' Miss
Jane e. Harbison. 1 Your charming volume.' Professor Tible (Leiden).



'I have read your delightful hook from the first to the last line, and what I feel
compelled to say is this : You have afforded me a pleasure of the highest and nohlest
kind, and I am a hetter and richer man for knowing your poem The description
of the art treasures is splendid, the philosophy derived from them is beautifully deep.
There is almost Hellenic purity and beauty in many parts of the work.' Dr. Max
NORDAU.
'Eloquent passages and lines which move us to content.' The Academy.
' Fluency, movement and grace. To him his subject seems supreme, real, everything.
The motives and ethics are worthy.' Weekly Sun.
' Poetic conception and treatment of a very high order A notable poem. '

the Author of Tellis and Kleobeia must take a foremost place.' Lincolnshire Notes and Queries.
SEMITIC INFLUENCE IN HELLENIC MYTHOLOGY. 7s. 6d.
' I owe you many thanks for having placed the whole problem of mythology in a clear
and true light.' Rt. Honble. Prof. MAX Muller.
' The subject is very interesting to me, and I agree with you in the opinion that there
are many Semitic and other Anaryan elements in Greek religion.' Prof. TlELE (Leiden University).
' 1 do not keep far from your point of view of the acceptance of the opinion of a strong
Semitic influence upon the Greek religion . . . Your most excellent work about the
constellations.' Prof. Dr. W. H, Roscher (Leipzig).
1 Mr. Brown's own position is that of one who seeks for the meaning of many Greek
divine names in Semitic philology ... In itself no theory can be more probable.'
Mr. Andrew Lang, in The Bookman.
' With Prof. Max Muller Mr. Brown's quarrel is mainly negative ; he only complains
that the Professor has ignored the extent of Semitic influence in Hellas and passed over
the writers who have demonstrated it. But as regards Mr. Lang he fights mainly on the
Professor's side, and fires several shots with very pretty effect both on his own account
and on that of his ally ... As to his polemics, he has a very pretty wit and no small
skill of fence, which Mr. Lang may be expected to parry if he can.' The Times.
1 Mr. Andrew Lang is a dexterous controversialist, wielding the sharpest of rapiers.
But he does not have it all his own way. Mr. R. Brown is an expert, but he can be
playful ; and in the first half of this volume he has a series of passages at arms with Mr.
Lang, and does sometimes dialectically " draw blood "
. . . Totemism, fire stealing, bear
cults, mouse-cults, earth-myths, dawn myths, Mr. Brown has a "go " at them all, and Mr.
Lang will need to sharpen his rapier once more.' The London Review.
'A work which ought to find a place on the shelves of all students of myths and folk
lore . . . Admirably written.' Echo.
' This is a lively and vigorous assault-at-arms in three bouts, defensive, offensive, and
constructive ... In the second part Mr. Brown takes up . . . his axe . . . and butchers
Mr. Lang on his own account ... On the intrinsic and fundamental issue we find
ourselves in substantial agreement with Mr. Brown's contention that old Greek myths
and Greek religion contain a considerable admixture of Semitic and other Oriental
elements . . . Mr. Brown is doing a good service in amassing and emphasizing the
evidence.' Manchester Guardian. ' A substantial contribution to mythological study.' Glasgow Herald. Real knowledge of Euphratean mythology.' Literature. 'A clever interesting volume ... the student of mythology will find many things
delightfully well put.' Expository Times. 1 Mr. Brown is probably right in emphasizing Semitic influence on various myths.' The
Literary World. ' Mr. Brown playfully criticizes the two authors [Prof. Max Muller and Mr. A. Lang]
above mentioned, leaning somewhat to the side of Prof. Max Muller. 'The Oxford Magazine. ' There are many features in the classical mythology that we learned at school which
are plainly not of Greek origin. Whence do they come? Mr. A. Lang thinks they can be
traced to the beliefs of savages ; but Mr. Brown thinks they were borrowed bodily from
the civilized inhabitants of Western Asia. It is most probable that Mr. Brown is right
