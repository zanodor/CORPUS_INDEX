PREFACE
Little need be said by way of preface to this book, which
will, I hope, sufficiently explain itself. I had better, how
ever, state, in order to guard against possible misapprehen
sion, that by Gnostic Christianity I mean the Christianity of
Paul and of the Fourth Gospel as distinguished from the doctrines of such writers as Basilides and Valentinus, which
I term Christian Gnosticism.
There is surprisingly little general knowledge of the
results of modern criticism of the Bible ; but, if I had to
begin by demonstrating the conclusions of such theological commentators as Wellhausen, Bousset, Reitzenstein, Loisy, and Guignebert, two or three volumes would be required instead of one. The only feasible course is to take their principal conclusions for granted,, with references where
necessary. I think I may fairly do this because, as they
are not in agreement with the main thesis of the present work, their reasoning cannot have been biased in favour of it.
On the whole I have preferred Dr. Bernard's version of the Odes of Solomon. Rendel Harris in his translation of
them was influenced by a presupposition as to their character
which I believe to be erroneous.
To avoid interruption of the argument, and to spare the
reader the trouble of referring back to an earlier page, I have, where necessary, repeated a quotation previously made.
I should like this book to be regarded as a continuation,
however imperfect, of the work of W. B. Smith, to whom my indebtedness is great.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTORY
1. Influence of Greek Philosophy upon Jewish
Religion
Several writers have remarked upon the impetus given to theosophical speculation by the contact between Jewish religion and Greek philosophy ; and a few have seen in the resulting fermentation of thought a preparation for the emergence of the Christian religion. Particularly among Jews of the Dispersion the mental horizon was widened by knowledge of Greek cosmological theories and of a meta physical monotheism which tended to create dissatisfaction with the anthropomorphic Jehovah of the Pentateuch. Concurrently with the intellectual advance an ethical move ment was in progress which in many people passed into an extreme asceticism. This became an important factor among the influences that were bringing about the formation
of sects in Jewry.
Among the finer minds the progress of thought and a
quickened sense of human misery and oppression gave rise
to a passionate desire to understand life and death, and the
problem of evil, to attain happiness or salvation. We see
the birth of a moral crisis in a restless and troubled world
as the Christian era draws near.1
A growing conviction that formal observances in religion had little value in comparison with purity of living was stimulated by the higher conception of the godhead, and resulted not only in a spiritualization of religion, but also in an intense longing for righteousness. Thus there came into existence communities of Jews who set themselves apart as God's elect and as the saints through whom the world was to be saved. Some of them, while rejecting formal

Time of Jesus, p. vii.



2 INTRODUCTORY
Judaism and the Mosaic Law, thought of themselves as a
new " chosen people," upon whom had devolved the obli gation to redeem, first of all their fellow-Jews and then the rest of the world. An important result of the new attitude of mind was the
transformation which it produced in the conception of
the character and function of the Messiah, who became in the most Hellenized of the communities an entirely spiritual
and metaphysical being. In the more conservative the change of view was naturally much less. Preparation had
already been made for it by some of the later prophets, who taught that the victory to be won under the leadership of the Messiah would not be a military one of Jews over Greeks or Romans, but a victory of Yahveh over the gods of the heathen. Yahveh would come to be worshipped through out the world, the Gentiles would resort to his temple, and
the Jews be honoured as his chosen people.1 A corollary of this belief was that the people must be worthy of their
god. It was incumbent upon them to demonstrate in the superiority of their own moral standards the superiority of the god whose chosen people they claimed to be. Unfortu nately increase of wealth and of luxury had brought about a serious relaxation of moral standards among the inhabi
tants of Judaea, and —which was even worse—unfaithfulness to the national god, as we may learn from the denunciations of the prophets. Then came into existence the communities of saints, differing much in doctrine, but applying to them selves the idea that the Jews had been chosen by God not merely for the sake of their own material advantage, but chiefly in order that they might make him known to the world and win over the Gentiles to his worship, and the related idea that by their superior righteousness they should prove themselves worthy of their high mission. The capture of Jerusalem by Pompey was a severe blow to those who still hoped for material domination; but the Jewish idealists who thought of the Messianic kingdom as the Kingdom of God upon earth decided that the divine promises could not be broken, though they must remain in 1 Isa. lv, 5; lvi, 6, 7. Zech. viii, 20-23.



INTRODUCTORY 3
abeyance until the people had become worthy' of their fulfilment. Meanwhile the wicked must be punished and the nation chastened for its amendment. The foregoing observations may be illustrated by extracts from the Psalms of Solomon, composed within a community of saints of a
comparatively very conservative type.
Distress and the sound of war mine ears have heard. . . .
And I heard a sound in Jerusalem the Holy City. . . . God
lay bare their sins before the sun, and to all the earth were
known the righteous judgments of the Lord; for in the
secret places of the earth were they doing evil . . . and they
left no sins which they did not commit and even worse than
the Gentiles. For this cause God mingled for them a cup
of error. . . . And he decrees war against Jerusalem and
against her land. . . . And they took possession of the
towers and walls of Jerusalem . . . and the saints of God
were as innocent lambs in their midst. (Ps. viii.)
Behold, O Lord, and raise up for them their king, the son
of David, and let him reign over Israel thy servant . . .
that he may gather together a holy people who shall exult
in righteousness . . . and he shall purify Jerusalem as it
was in old time, that the Gentiles may come from the ends
of the earth to behold his glory . . . and he, the righteous
king, is over them, and there is no wicked person in his days
among them because they are all righteous and their king
is the Lord Messiah (Ps. xvii).
In the last of these extracts we see in a pre-Christian Jewish writing the idea of the future Kingdom of God which became so important in Christian doctrine.. The Kingdom of the psalm is evidently not the eschatological Kingdom of
the apocalypses. It is the Kingdom of primitive Christi anity, which was composed of the Christian communities
and would grow with their growth until it had permeated the world, as the leaven permeates the meal (Matt, xiii, 33).
Both conceptions of the Kingdom are found in the Gospels, but the eschatological conception was a later importation.
Hellenized Jews who no longer expected a messianic " Son
of David " were obliged to adjust their conception of the Kingdom to their widened religious outlook, and they
substituted for the Judaic ruler a supernatural —in some
cases an invisible spiritual—Messiah (Christ). These Jews
had begun to classify men as righteous and unrighteous

irrespective of race, and to conceive of a spiritual ruler of the
universe who had no nationality and whose " elect " were not necessarily Jews. The loftier conception of godhead was, as will be shown hereafter, largely the result of Greek influence ; the Jews of the Dispersion were forced to realize that they were not the only monotheists. Josephus maintained that the Greeks had acquired their knowledge of God from Moses. The Hellenized Jews who compared the god of the Pentateuch
with " the One " of Greek philosophy could not be of that opinion; but, since they desired a religion and not merely a philosophy, they gradually worked out a theosophy which, though shaped in the main by foreign influences, never lost certain characteristics which had been impressed upon it in its Jewish origin. Naturally the system arrived at took different forms in different minds; but even Philo, who clung to the religion of his forefathers, was able to do so only by investing the ancient beliefs with a new significance. An analogous transformation of religion was taking place n the Pagan world. The period in which Christianity had its birth and infancy was intensely religious. Perhaps there has never been one more so ; and religion was becoming a more individual and personal concern. The ancient gods and goddesses had been made ridiculous by the satirists; but, just as many Jews endeavoured to abolish the crudities of the Old Testament theology by allegorical interpretation of the Pentateuch, so did Pagans by symbolical interpreta tion of ancient myths extract from them cosmogonal theories and occult revelations of a spiritual relationship between
God and man. For the common people the public ceremo nial was too formal and too much a State affair to satisfy an individual spiritual need, especially as the loss of political liberty and the dissolution of national boundaries were destroying men's interest in the State. The terrible dis tresses of the civil wars had intensified the longing for a Saviour. The great gods seemed too remote and the God of the philosophers too metaphysical and colourless for a personal relationship. The average man desired a god whom he could not only worship but also love ; one whom he
'!



INTRODUCTORY 6
could imagine as having sympathy with the poor and oppressed and who would help him in his genuine endeavour to lead a better life. Gods of the second rank thus came into prominence as saviour-gods, for whose worship com munities were formed on a democratic and fraternal basis, providing the members with an interest which was no longer to be found in political life. The primitive Christian com munities did not, in their general character, differ essentially from these.1 They were all products of the same environ
ment and the same spiritual need —a need which led to the establishment and growing popularity of Mystery cults in which immortal life was guaranteed conditionally upon the worship of some god and upon the performance of rites by which his help could be secured and the attacks of evil daemons repelled. Purity of life was required, though the standard of purity was rather an oriental than a modern one, and undoubtedly the rites and incantations did tend to degenerate into mere magic and to assume undue import ance. The immortality believed to be assured by them might become the predominant attraction to the weakening of the effort to live well. Nevertheless the reliance upon magic was neither so exclusive nor so exclusively Pagan as
some Christian writers have thought. It is certain at least that as a rule in the Mystery cults admission to the highest
grade of " the perfect " and participation in the innermost
" Mystery " would be granted only to persons who had been
leading blameless lives. It is doubtful whether in respect of general conduct there was much practical difference between the members of the Christian and Pagan religious communities ; 2 but the former had a very important dis tinguishing mark, which they had inherited from their
Jewish ancestry —viz., the belief that they had received a divine commission to convert the world to the worship of the one true God, and the related belief that the gods of the Pagans were false gods. They did not, however, deny the existence of these gods ; they said they were daemons.
1 A good account of the " Thiasic " or " Eranistic " religious
social communities will be found in Kalthoff's Rise of Christianity,
chaps, iv and v.

6 INTRODUCTORY
To many of the Hellenistic Jews it seemed unbefitting that the pure abstraction into which they had refined their deity should have direct contact with gross matter, nor did they
consider it possible that he could be immediately known. Hence it became necessary to imagine an intermediary and
revealer—a spiritual being who could bring God into re
lationship with the world. A mediator in the later Christian sense of the term they did not require, because their God
was not a judge. For spiritual men, the saints, salvation was assured; the unspiritual, having no immortal part, must necessarily perish. The thought of the loving kindness of God was not a new one at the beginning of the first cen
tury. It would be a mistake to suppose that Jews in general just before the rise of Christianity had regarded Yahveh as a severe judge before whom men could feel only fear. Cer tainly they believed that he would punish the wicked, but
they also believed that his justice would be tempered with mercy, and that every one who was redeemable he would chasten in love. The love and mercy of God are a frequent theme of the canonical Psalms, and in the Testaments of the
TwelvePatriarchs we find evidence that a hundred years before the Christian era there were some Jews who did not limit the
love of God to their own people. In the Psalms of Solomon
God is termed Saviour and is said to be kind and merciful for ever. The writer of these Psalms, being Judaic, no doubt
thought of God as especially the God of the Jews, but he felt no need of a mediator to stand between men and the severity of God. The point of view of the writer of the
second half of the Wisdom of Solomon was quite similar, but
more universal :
Thou hast mercy on all men, and thou overlookest the
sins of men to the end that they may repent. For thou
lovest all things that are. . . . Thou sparest all things,
because they are thine, 0 Sovereign Lord, thou lover of men's lives (xi, 23 ff.).
2. The Wisdom Literature
The Hellenization of Jewish religion, resulting in a univer
salistic and highly spiritualized conception of deity, was



INTRODUCTORY 7
already in progress a hundred years before the beginning of the Christian era, and is exemplified in what is known as the Wisdom literature. During the last pre-Christian century the theosophy of that literature was being developed. The growing conviction, among Pagans as well as Jews, that God is not to be placated like an earthly monarch by cere mony and gifts, but that salvation is to be attained through some kind of spiritual union of men with God, was producing that type of religious emotionalism which we call mysticism. Religion of this type early took root in Egypt, where the
Wisdom of Solomon was written, and in Asia Minor it found
a congenial soil. From the writings of Philo of Alexandria
we can infer the attraction which it had for enfranchised
religious thinkers among the Jews; and there were some who had liberated themselves much more from tradition
than he had. A tendency of the age which in some Greek minds was transforming Platonism into Neo-Platonism operated among Jews to bring into existence a theosophy which was a species of Neo-Platonism of an intensely religious kind. The Jewish mystics sought to know God, not by the exercise of reason, but by inward spiritual vision, and to achieve union with him by rites to which they attached symbolic significance. From this point of view the ritual of the Mosaic Law seemed to be valueless. The subordination of sacrifice and ritual to right conduct had already been made even by some Jews who continued to practise those ceremonial acts ; but the higher conception
of deity naturally brought with it a gradual rejection of rites which had been rooted in a different order of religious ideas, varying in extent according to the intensity of the reform ing spirit, which, then as now, inspired different people in different degrees. The belief that sacrifices can give no pleasure to God is expressed in some of the later Psalms.
For example :
Sacrifice and burnt offering thou didst not desire; mine
ears hast thou opened ; burnt offering and sin offering hast
thou not required (Ps. xl, 6).
The writers of the Wisdom literature have a very great



8 INTRODUCTORY
deal to say in praise of wisdom but very little indeed about
the Law. In the first half of the Wisdom of Solomon the
word does not occur at all. The distinctive feature of the literature is the prominence given to Wisdom, the Greek
Sophia, which is personified. In the Wisdom of Solomon
the Word of God, the Logos, is also personified, though not
prominent. It seems likely that originally the personifi
cation was little more than poetic metaphor, but it is so thoroughly and graphically done that the subsequent litcralization of the metaphor is not at all surprising. Pure abstraction, indeed, seems to have been an impossibility
for ancient thinkers. In the first quarter of the first century Sophia and the Logos had definitely become spiritual beings who were believed to have a real existence. Through
them—or one of them—the requisite " revelation " was supposed to have been made. With the personification of Wisdom in the Book of Proverbs all readers of the Bible are familiar. The personification is continued in the book
of " the Wisdom of Jesus, Son of Sirach," known as Ecclesiasticus, in which Wisdom is so concretely represented as to have become a participating agent in the creation of the
world. She is made to declare :
I came forth from the mouth of the Most High and covered
the earth as a mist. I dwelt upon the height and my throne
is in the pillar of the cloud. Alone I compassed the circuit
of heaven and walked in the depth of the abyss (xxiv, 3-5).
Two expressions in these verses are of particular importance.
The statement that Wisdom " came forth from the mouth
of the Most High " foreshadows the assimilation of Wisdom
to the Word which afterwards came about. In fact, the writer must already have been thinking of the Word of God as the expression of his wisdom. And the statement that
Wisdom " covered the earth as a mist " may have contributed
by comparison with the statement in Genesis that " the
Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters " to the subsequent identification of Wisdom with the Holy Spirit. The result of this readjustment of conceptions was that eventually the qualities and operations of Wisdom were



INTRODUCTORY 9
transferred to the Logos, while Wisdom remained the Holy Spirit.
In Ecchsiasticus a belief in the dual nature of man has not yet been reached. There is no future life, and no thought of the resurrection of the body. Belief in a bodily resurrection never in fact makes its appearance in the Wisdom literature ; nor was it held by the Gnostics who were
inspired by that literature. " All that is of earth," it is
said, " shall go back to the earth " (xli, 10). " The son of
man is not immortal " (xvii, 30). " All men are dust and
ashes " (ib., 33). Men therefore cannot be encouraged by
the writer to be virtuous through the promise of future reward in a life of eternal bliss. The reward of virtue is
honourable fame. " The bodies of honourable men are
buried in peace, but their name liveth for evermore " (xliv,
14). The others " have perished as though they had
never been " (ib., 9). In chapter li there is mention of
the soul and of Hell; but that chapter is evidently a later addition to the book.1 The writer of Ecchsiasticus was still far more Jew than Greek. The terms in which he writes of God savour of anthropomorphism, and the problem of the unknowability of God does not seem
to have troubled him. But it was not long before more philosophically-minded Jews began to think of the Most High as a spiritual being, remote and unknowable. The agent through whom God had made himself known was then found in Wisdom, who was supposed to have mystically imparted the knowledge to the pious by entering into their souls. Perception of the difference between the metaphysical deity thus made known and the Yahveh of the Old Testament afterwards led many Gnostics to the opinion that the god of the Jews was an inferior being, responsible for the evil that exists in the world. Eventually the revealing function of Wisdom was, with her other qualities
and functions, transferred to the Logos. The,knowledge of God's nature and purpose so brought became known by the
Greek term Gnosis, from which the Gnostics derived their

name. The idea is already found in the Book of Proverbs,
where it is written :
If thou wilt incline thine ear unto Wisdom and apply
thine heart to understanding; yea, if thou criest after
knowledge, then shalt thou find the knowledge of God
(ii, 2^5).
Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets . . . scorners and fools [i.e., sinners] hate knowledge.
. . . Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way,
and be filled with their own devices
(i,
20-31).
My son, let not them [Wisdom and the knowledge of the
Lord] depart from thine eyes ... so shall they be life unto
thy soul (iii, 21, 22).
It will be evident from these quotations that Gnosis was some thing very different from the intellectual knowledge that can
be acquired by learning and the application of reason. An
unrighteous man might have that kind of knowledge. But Gnosis,
it
is
said,
is
life unto the soul. This, in the passage above quoted,
is
possibly a figure of speech
;
but
it
did not remain so
;
later religious thinkers held very decidedly and literally that Gnosis was the condition of eternal life, and the reception of
it
by those who had not previously possessed
it
a " resurrection from the dead," the only kind of resur rection which they recognized. The doctrine of the re demption of men through the knowledge of God was of the essence of Gnosticism. Proceeding to an examination of
''
the Wisdom
of
Solomon,'
'
l
we find that in the interval the Hellenization of Jewish religious thought has been advancing. We can trace the influence of Greek speculative ideas with regard to man and the cosmos, such as the Platonic doctrines of the human soul and the divine Reason (Logos) and the stoic doctrine of a world-soul, which certainly are not simply borrowed, but combined and transformed under the action of the Jewish preconceptions of the writer. Thus we may account for the appearance of the belief in an immortal spirit in man which
is
related to the Spirit of God. And the Spirit of God
is
identified with Wisdom. There
is
evidence that the
writer was acquainted with Plato's description of the Just
1
Written at Alexandria, probably about 100 B.C.



INTRODUCTORY 11
Man persecuted and slain by the unrighteous. Wisdom, although pure spirit, is still very definitely personified and accessible.
She is easily beheld by those who love her. He that riseth
up early to seek her shall find her sitting at his gates. She
goeth about, herself seeking those who are worthy of her.
To give heed to her laws confirmeth incorruption ; and
incorruption bringeth near unto God (Wis. vi, 12-19).
The writer's exaltation of the laws of Wisdom may be taken as an indication that he had no great regard for the Mosaic Law, which, as before observed, he never mentions.
The " beholding " of Wisdom is obviously not a case of
physical vision; it must be some kind of intuitive know
ledge. It is important to bear this in mind for the proper understanding of similar expressions in the works of later Jewish and Christian mystics. Notwithstanding the writer's personification of Wisdom, in his innermost thought she was no more a person than the world-soul or the Logos of Plato.
She is more mobile than any motion ; yea, she pervadeth
and penetrateth all things by reason of her pureness. For
she is a breath of the power of God, and a clear effluence of
the glory of the Almighty. She is an effulgence from
everlasting light; and, being one, she hath power to do
all things. And remaining in herself reneweth all things;
from generation to generation passing into holy souls (Wis.
vii, 24^27).
It is clear from this passage that the assimilation of Wisdom to the Holy Spirit adumbrated in Ecclesiasticus has now been
accomplished. In another verse the equivalence of the two
is even more definitely stated :
Who ever gained knowledge of thy counsel except thou
gavest Wisdom, and sentest thy Holy Spirit from above
(»., ix, 17).
God's incorruptible Spirit is said to be in all things —an opinion which was held in some form or another by later Gnostics. Gnostic doctrine in embryo is also seen in viii,
13—" By her I shall obtain immortality "—for receiving Wisdom is receiving the knowledge of God, which is Gnosis.



12 INTRODUCTORY
Logos in this book, as in Christian doctrine, is the Word of
God, not the divine Reason which is Plato's Logos. It is Wisdom who is the divine Reason as well as being the worldsoul. But the Logos partially displaces Wisdom as the
agent of God in the work of creation. God, it is said, made all things by his Word, but by Wisdom he made man (ix, 1).
Here we see the first stage of the process in which the Logos eventually became nearly all that Wisdom had been before.
In Christian literature Wisdom subsists as the Holy Spirit, which in some Gnostic Christian doctrine is feminine and the mother of the Logos, the Christ. But as Sophia she became very prominent in the theosophical speculations of Philo and of many Christian Gnostics.
In the Wisdom of Solomon the Word is personified as
thoroughly as Wisdom. He sits beside God upon the throne of Heaven and descends to execute the decrees of God upon
earth :
While peaceful silence enwrapped all things, and night in
her own swiftness was in mid course, thine all-powerful
Word leaped from Heaven out of the royal throne, a stern
warrior into the midst of the doomed land, bearing as a
sharp sword thine unfeigned commandment (xviii, 14-16).
The growing contempt for a ritual which consisted of prescriptions directed to material objects and concerned with material operations was fostered by the doctrine which
founded upon the incorruptible divine spirit—pneumathe assurance of immortality for men, contrasting this immaterial spirit with corruptible matter. Solomon in
Wisdom is made to say : " Because of her [Wisdom =
Holy Spirit] I shall have immortality " (viii, 13) ; but of the
wicked it is said : " they shall become a dishonoured car
case " (iv, 18). And again : " The hope of the ungodly is
like the dust that is blown away by the wind; but the righteous live for ever." According to this doctrine death of the unspiritual man is extinction. But in one section, which is perhaps a later insertion, a different doctrine makes its appearance, in which the souls of the wicked are after their death confined in Hades. The apparently discrepant expressions are not, however, absolutely incompatible. The



INTRODUCTORY 13
writer could have regarded the eternal confinement of the
soul in Hades as equivalent to annihilation. In this doctrine we may see the beginning of the Gnostic tripartite division
of the nature of man into pneumatic, psychic, and carnal. The psychic man was supposed to have a soul (psyche), but only pneumatic people were capable of eternal life in the sense in which Gnostics used the term. We are not precisely
informed with regard to Gnostic opinion about Hell ; but it is certain that those of them who contemplated the confine ment of souls in an under- world did not admit the possibility of any return from it. The compositeness of the Wisdom
of Solomon has been recognized by some scholars. It is
fairly evident that chapters x to xix are a later addition to the work. The inferior literary merit of these chapters has been commented upon even by some critics who do not dispute their originality. The closing verses, 13 to 18, of chapter ix have all the appearance of having been written as a conclusion. The point is not of great importance. The difference of religious outlook exhibited in the two halves of the work is not considerable ; but recognition of the difference1 of authorship is conducive to a right under standing of the book. The writer of Wisdom did not believe that sin and death came into the world through the disobedience of Adam. So that he anticipated the Gnostics in not accepting the Pentateuch as the inspired word of God. Death of the body is not in his view a penalty, but rather a release and the natural consequence of the corruptibility of matter. The only kind of life with which he is concerned is the eternal life of the spirit.
God hath not made death. For he created all things
that they might have their being; and the generations of
the world are healthsome. And there is no poison of de
struction in them ; nor hath Hell royal dominion upon
earth, for righteousness is immortal; but ungodly men by
their hands and their words called death unto them (Wis.
i, 13-16).
We also find in this book the germ of that extreme asceticism which was afterwards so prominent a feature of certain



14 INTRODUCTORY
1
Gnostic sects. It left its mark upon the Pauline Epistles,1 and even affected the practice of the Catholic Church in the celibacy of the clergy. This asceticism is a consequence of the theory of the dual nature of man, which was not of native origin in the Hellenistic sects. The basis of the asceticism is the hampering of the pure life of the spirit by the lusts of the flesh, which accordingly must be mortified in order that the spiritual nature may attain its perfect development.
" A corruptible body is heavy unto the soul and the earthly
mansion keepeth down the mind that is full of cares " (Wis. ix, 15). We find even the preference for the single to
the married state which is exhibited in 1 Cor. vii, 8 and in the doctrine of the Gnostic Marcion.
Happy is the barren that is undefiled, she who hath not
conceived in transgression; she shall have fruit when God
visiteth souls. And happy is the eunuch who has wrought no lawless
deed with his hands, nor imagined wicked things against
the Lord. For there shall be given him for his faithfulness
a peculiar favour, and a lot more delightsome than wife
and children (iii, 13).
The writer, like the Essenes and the writer of 1 Cor. vii, 8, 27, 28, does not condemn marriage, but he evidently held that no material condition is in and for itself comparable in importance to perfection of the spiritual life, and that the body and material joys are a hindrance to the working of the spirit.
In addition to the features already described, there is a noteworthy indication of the view previously held by Jews in a more Judaic form but now universalized, that God had specially chosen the Jews to carry to the Gentiles 'the knowledge of himself.2 And the feeling of responsibility thereby engendered was intensified in such men as the writer of the Wisdom of Solomon by their conviction that
only in the latter days had God in large measure revealed

Catholic editor, scenting Gnostic doctrine, has substituted " deeds

himself through Wisdom. They were spurred on by the abhorrence of idolatry which for some time men of their race had passionately felt. Partly fired by indignation, partly impelled by compassion, on beholding the Pagan
world sunk, as it seemed to them, in the darkness of religious error, worshipping false gods and ignorant of the true, they imagined that their own better knowledge was a guarantee of their divine mission to carry light into the darkness.
" Verily," says the writer of Wisdom, " all men by nature are but vain who have had no perception of God." With these words he introduces an eloquent condemnation of
idolatry and polytheism which occupies three chapters xiii to xv. He may not himself have been an active propa gandist, but the opinions which he expressed and which must have been shared by many of his contemporaries inspired with reforming zeal men of a later generation.
Isaiah prophesied that Israel would be " a light to lighten the Gentiles." Hellenistic Jews substituted for Israel the congregation of the saints, and for the Judaic Messiah, as the bringer of truth and fight, the Logos. Ultimately, however, in Catholic Christianity the Logos was merged into the Messiah.
3. Hellenistic Jewish Sects
There can be no doubt that to the Wisdom of Solomon
ostensibly the composition of King Solomon himself —was ascribed a very high value in certain circles, and that the
ideas expressed in it exerted a powerful influence upon the thought of Hellenistic Jews in the last pre-Christian century and afterwards. Not that these ideas were absolutely new ;
but it is likely that there was some originality in the form in which they are poetically expressed. The book must have helped to intensify a fermentation that had already begun, the outcome of which was a revolution in the sphere i of religion comparable in importance with the Protestant Reformation. The factors in operation have already been sketched. And just as some Catholics in the sixteenth century thought that abuses in the Church could be and
should be reformed from within, so there were Jews who,



16 INTRODUCTORY
like the writer of the Psalms of Solomon, looked forward to
the coming of a messianic king who would bring to an end every kind of unrighteousness and religious laxity among their fellow-countrymen, leading at the same time the
whole world to the knowledge of, and into subjection to, the Jewish god. But there were Jews of the Dispersion who could not share these anticipations. They saw that the Jehovah of the Old Testament, the god of one nation, could
not be expected to win the admiration of Greeks. They no
longer believed in the future reign of a messianic king.
And they realized fully that it was not by the Judaic religion, with its ritual purifications, its circumcision, its formal observance of seasons, and its distinction between clean and unclean meat, that the Pagan cults would be superseded. They had risen, as they thought, to a higher conception of the godhead than had hitherto entered the minds either of Jews or Pagans taken as a whole. They aimed, like the Protestants, at the establishment of a reformed religion which would not only satisfy themselves, but also have power by its obvious superiority to abolish the idolatrous polytheism of the Gentiles. Their zeal was quickened by an eager longing for righteousness, which, they believed, would not be confined to themselves, but would, necessarily flow out into the world from a knowledge of the true God. Ritual they did not entirely reject ; for they attached con siderable value to certain ceremonial acts, which they were
able to invest with symbolic significance.
It is a law of human nature that when members of a community are powerfully agitated by new ideas, whether in religion or in politics, which conflict with those held by the majority, they are impelled to group themselves in parties or associations for mutual encouragement and, it
may be, for more effectual propagandist activity. And just as among the Protestants at the Reformation some were satisfied with moderate changes while others were more radical, and a few were carried away into an extreme policy
and embraced ideas which appear fantastic, so also, as we learn from contemporary authorities, there were in existence at the commencement of the Christian era Jewish sects in



INTRODUCTORY 17
which there was much diversity of doctrine and practice. The Essenes practised an extreme asceticism derivable from the doctrine of Wisdom that indulgence in physical pleasures is a hindrance to the life of the spirit. Josephus terms them
a sect of the Jews, but as he thought it necessary to begin
his account of them with the words : " these are Jews by birth," it is inferable that, although they continued to prac
tise some Judaic ritual customs, in doctrine they differed considerably from other Jews. Certain it is that their religious tenets were of a Hellenistic type. They had re jected the Pharisaic doctrine of the resurrection of the body
in favour of the teaching of Wisdom that the spirit only is
immortal. Pliny termed them philosophers, whence we may conclude that he had discovered in their opinions the influence of Greek philosophy ; but they were too intensely religious for the term to be appropriate. The desire to know God and to lead a holy life was the motive-force which actuated them, impelling them to separate themselves from all who were not of their own communion. Holding that all men are equal, they condemned not only slavery, but also a paid servitude, and they possessed all things in common. They would not take an oath, and their asceticism led them to discountenance marriage, though they did not forbid it. They had a sacred meal to which only those among them
who had undergone a long probation were admitted. At these meetings the scriptures were expounded by approved teachers. Of the character of their esoteric doctrine very
little is known, since members were forbidden to divulge it ; but we know that they interpreted the Old Testament symbolically, regarding the letter as a husk within which
a spiritual meaning was enshrined. In spite of the fact that they considered themselves in danger of pollution when they came into contact with people whose discipline was not so rigid as their own, some of them travelled about a good
deal, and it has been inferred that these journeys were missionary journeys and that the sect carried on an active
propaganda.1 It is at any rate certain that small commu

nities, here and there perhaps even rather large ones, were scattered over an area of considerable extent ; and not only in the open country. For the travelling Essenes, when they visited a town, were able to obtain free lodging from some one of their own persuasion. Their principles forbade
them to eat with any one else.1 Another important sect was that of the Therapeuts, of whom Philo wrote that they would strip themselves of their property and flee from their relatives and their fatherland to avoid the disturbing attractions which life in common with
others can exert. " They do not, however, wander into another town, since every town is full of unrest and unspeak able impulses which he who has once been possessed by
Wisdom cannot endure." In this statement we see an indication of the influence of the Wisdom literature. The Therapeuts, like the Essenes, strove to put into operation the idea of the natural equality of all men, maintaining that the injustice and avarice of individuals who endeavour to organize inequality, the primary cause of all evil, have put into the hands of the stronger power over the weaker.2
The Therapeuts also had a common meal at which the scriptures were expounded, the principle of interpretation being that the literal expressions are symbols of a secret nature revealing truth allegorically.3 The method remained
in favour with early Christians who probably did not doubt the literal truth of passages thus expounded, as we may
learn from the Epistle of Barnabas. The same method of
interpretation was used by Philo himself and by the later Gnostics, who, however, more consistently rejected the letter in favour of what they conceived to be the spirit. The information furnished by Philo and Josephus leaves ix-very little room for doubt that the mental attitude of these '/*. two sects was that which appears later. _as Gnosticism.4
In them and in their like it had its breeding-ground. Philo,

INTRODUCTORY 19
writing of a sect unnamed but inferably Therapeuts, says of them that they are possessed by an unspeakable love of contemplation and of being conversant with matters divine, proceeding always from the visible and corporeal to the incorporeal and abstract; letting go all that is irrational in the sentient soul and clinging to that which is called mind (nous) and reason.1 This description would apply to Gnos
tics in general, many of whom personified Nous, and the people were obviously mystics. Another Gnostic trait in
the sect referred to was their contempt for the flesh. " They
strive," says Philo, " to loosen the bond of the psyche and to become incorporeal in thought." Elsewhere, naming the Therapeuts, he says that, like corybants, filled with holy inspiration, they long for contemplation of the truth until they see what they have longed for. Evidently the spiritual truth so desired is no other than Gnosis, for its attainment waa considered by them to be the means of securing eternal life. As Jews, both sects no doubt believed in some kind of Messiah, whpm they must have connected in some manner with their theosophical system.
In relation to official Judaism the Essenes and Therapeuts were as Protestants in relation to Roman Catholicism ; but Protestants of a moderate type. There were others whose
non-conformity went farther —e.g., the Naassenes and the Peratai, who were already Gnostics in the full sense of the
term. It was possibly such sects as these that Philo had in
mind when he wrote : " But there are people who, holding the writings of the Law to be symbols of a spiritual life, carefully search for the latter but contemn the former.
Such men I cannot but blame." All these sects were
undoubtedly of pre-Christian origin. Philo tells us that the Therapeuts possessed writings of the men of an earlier day, who had been their leaders and had left many records of their allegorical interpretation of Scripture. And, as Philo
says of them that they " philosophized," 2 we may infer that they, like himself, brought to bear in their allegorical inter pretation of the Old Testament some knowledge of Greek

20 INTRODUCTORY
philosophy. Some pre-Christian Gnostics, probably Cainites, are attacked in the Book of Enoch.1 Philo knows
nothing of Christians as such ; no doubt because in his time there was no organized Christian Church. There were scattered communities from the union of which the Christian Church was ultimately constituted. As it is written in the
preface to Guignebert's book : "In these sects [Gnostic], these exclusive circles which believed themselves to be the depositories of absolute Truth and of Salvation, we may find the true explanation of Christianity." Of all the pre-Christian Gnostic sects the one which occu pied the most extreme position of anti-Judaism was that of the Mandaeans, who stigmatized the Pentateuch as an abomination and explicitly rejected the god of the Jews, regarding him as an evil being. Most of the sects named attached symbolic importance to baptism. They had all of them discontinued the offering of sacrifices and would
not participate in the Temple worship. In these sects, in others which will engage our attention, and in Philo, how ever much their opinions may have differed in detail, we j have evidence, not only of widely -ranging theosophical
! speculation, but also of an exalted ethical ideal. Such was the environment in which Christianity first took
shape. Anyone who can form a mental picture of the fermen tation of thought which was in progress at the commence ment of the Christian era should be able to see that something remarkable was on the eve of being produced. Groups of
God-intoxicated men, believing that God —an indefinable
spiritual Being who desired no sacrifices —had revealed himself to them alone, setting up an ethical standard upon a foundation of asceticism and the belief that all men are by nature equal, hating Polytheism, and declaring a holy war against it, had brought into the world a force which was not likely to ebb quietly away leaving no more than a ripple | upon the tide of human progress. Philosophy was not for
the masses. The Saviour-cults satisfied a widely -felt spiritual

need. It remained to be seen whether the new theosophy, which was certainly superior to the idolatrous and in some cases sensual worship of the Pagans, could so adapt itself as successfully to compete with it.
It is a priori quite likely that in addition to the sects named, and some others of which we have information, there existed in the larger towns of Greece and Asia Minor
smaller and less prominent communities of reforming Jews
" saints " or " elect "—either connected with these or in dependently arising, concerning whom we could have know
ledge only if some of their religious literature had survived. We could hardly expect direct evidence of the kind when account is taken of the certainty that a considerable quan tity of contemporary literature must have perished. But in the catacombs at Rome some valuable indications of the existence there of Hellenized Jews have been discovered.
In a Jewish catacomb Pagan emblems, to which no doubt symbolic significance was attached, and pictures of Orpheus together with those of Moses, David, and Daniel, have been
found. In the Jewry of Alexandria Orpheus was identified with David and with Adam, presumably by Jewish Gnostics who saw in these persons a prefiguration of the ChristLogos. Orphism seems to have disappeared as a distinct
cult at the commencement of the Christian era, having
been absorbed into the cult of Dionysus; it is evident, however, that in the syncretism of the period Hellenized Jews had been influenced by it. Now there is evidence that some of these Jews afterwards became Gnostic Christians. For in Christian catacombs specifically Christian figures and emblems do not make their appearance before the second century, but prior to that pictures of Orpheus are found. There is evidence that before the Christian era in certain I Jewish circles Yahveh and Dionysus had been fused together ; and in those circles there must have been affinity with the
religious outlook of the worshippers of Dionysus. It is therefore, in an investigation into the pre-Christian environ ment, important to note the fact, mentioned by Cumont, that in the Christian catacomb of Praetextatus a priest of the Thracian god Dionysos Sabazios was buried with his

Jewish wife Vibia.1 We thus have evidence that a Jewish Mystery-cult closely related to a Pagan Mystery-cult sub sequently became Christian; and certainly the community would be Gnostic Christian. Accordingly we have to think of the border centuries as a period of religious syncretism, influenced by Greek philo sophy and oriental theosophy, giving rise to sects among the Jews, mystic in character, having certain fundamental ideas in common but expressing them in various forms. Fortunately we are not entirely dependent for our know ledge upon information supplied by Philo and Josephus and derived from inscriptions and pictures. The psalm book * of one of the communities has been discovered. The "Txmembers were not Essenes or Therapeuts, but they were
/ Hellenistic Jews nurtured principally upon the Psalms and
the Wisdom literature. They were religious reformers and mystics who, though anti-Judaic, had not ceased to consider
themselves Jews. These statements I shall endeavour to
make good by a careful examination of the book, the title of which is The Odes of Solomon.

pp. 178 ff.



CHAPTER II
THE ODES OF SOLOMON : THEIR CHARACTER AND
PROBABLE DATE
1. They are Jewish
The first point to be established is that the community which used the Odes was originally composed of Jews and that
when they were written it was still predominantly Jewish. Few perhaps would deny this ; but with regard to the book there has been much controversy. The controversy, how ever, is to some degree a verbal one arising out of the' ambiguity of the term Jewish. When Rendel Harris, for
example, denies that the Odes are Jewish it is evident from his argument that his real meaning is that they are not
Judaic —which is certainly true. They are in fact anti
Judaic; but Harris's inference that since they are antiJudaic they must be Christian is unsound; for we have seen reason to believe that early in the first century there were non-conformist Jewish sects, some of which might even be anti-Judaic. As we shall see, they could be called Christian in a certain sense; but that would depend upon our definition of the term Christian. When commenting upon the Odes with no controversial object in view, Harris
makes it clear that his recognition of the Jewish character of the community and of the man who wrote its psalm-book
is quite definite. Thus he expresses the opinion that " the poetical style, or the poetry, of the Odes is more Hebraic and more early Syriac than Ephremic; and with some reserve
... we would venture to add that it is more Hebraic than
early Syriac." 1 In another place he writes : " the Odist lives next door to the Synagogue and in the Jewish quarter,"
and he infers that the Odes were written at a time " when the Church was still adjacent to the Synagogue." These are the observations of an acute scholar ; but one
1 The Odes and Psalms of Solomon, Vol. II, p. 131. 23



24 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
must record the objection that in using the term " the
Church " Harris was reasoning beyond his data. The admissible inference is that the community whose doctrines are embodied in the Odes, which for convenience of reference
I shall term the community O, was " adjacent to the Syna
gogue "—in other words, had not long separated itself
from orthodox Judaism. There was no Christian " Church " in the sense in which Harris uses the term even at the date
to which he assigns the Odes —near the end of the first
century of our era. As Dr. W. Voelker wrote, " The ' great
Church ' [second century] is not, as scholars assume, the
Catholic Church, but a loose federation of communities which had not yet assumed the highly organized forms of government and theology which are called Catholic." 1 The community O was probably one of these communities ;
and whether it had even yet entered into the " loose federa
tion " depends upon the date at which the Odes were written. There are good reasons for thinking that Harris's date is too late. Grimme argued that the original language of the Odes was
Hebrew. Dr. J. H. Bernard's comment is that " Grimme's
arguments tend to support the theory of a Semitic original
for the Odes —not necessarily or probably in Biblical Hebrew, but in Aramaic or Syiac." According to Dr. Menzies they are Jewish throughout. Some other critics think they are Christian. Harnack, who considered that in their original form they were purely Jewish, supposed that they were interpolated by a Christian ca. 100 c.e. Grimme also ad vanced a theory of Christian interpolation. The weight of
expert opinion is, however, opposed to that theory. It has been discredited by the arguments of Clemen 2 and of Dom. Conolly.8 Harris lays stress upon the unity of style which the Odes exhibit and considers them to be the work
of a single author. In reference to the suggestion that strata of late theological thought are to be found in certain of the
Odes he observes that it is these very Odes that may turn

out to have the earliest literary attestation. Dr. Bernard
wrote, " The style and manner of the Odes is the same throughout." The theory of extensive interpolation may therefore be
dismissed; but it is not necessary to agree with the oppo nents of it in assuming that there are no interpolations at all. An ancient book used by Christians for a considerable length of time entirely free from interpolations would be something of a curiosity, and we may expect to find a few. The positive reasons for characterizing the Odes as Jewish, in addition to the linguistic evidence previously referred to, are these : four books of the Old Testament, either canonical
or apocryphal, were in ancient times ascribed to Solomon viz., Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, and Wisdom. Since all of these are indisputably Jewish, the presumption is that the Odes of Solomon was also a Jewish work. The presump
tion is very much strengthened by the fact that in the extant MSS. the Odes are bound up with Psalms of Solomon,
as to the Jewish character of which there is no question.
In a sixth-century catalogue of Sacred Books published under the name of Athanasius, an enumeration of the cano nical books of the Old Testament is followed (col. 239) by :
" Besides these there are also other books of the Old Testa ment, not regarded as canonical but read to the catechu mens." This sentence is very similar to a sentence of the genuine Athanasius in his list of sacred Books, and both writers then proceed to mention the books of Wisdom,
Ecclesiasticus, Esther, Judith, and Tobit. But Pseudo
Athanasius adds at a later period (col. 432) " Maccabees . . .
Psalms and Odes of Solomon, Susanna." 1 " The Stichometry of Nicephorus is a list of scriptural books reduced to its present form, according to Zahn, about the year 850. The second part of the list runs as follows : those which are not rejected but not accepted as canonicals-Maccabees, Wisdom of Solomon, Wisdom of the Son of Sirach (Ecclesi
asticus), Psalms and Odes of Solomon, Esther, Judith, Susanna, Tobit, and Tobias. These writers may have been
copying an older list." 2 It will thus be seen that at an early
1 Dr. Bernard, Texts and Studies, Vol. VIII, No, 3. • Ibid.
O—G.0



26 THE ODES OF SOLOMON :
date no distinction was made between the Odes of Solomon
and other uncanonical books of the Old Testament. Fur thermore, passages from the Odes are quoted as Scripture
by Lactantius and in Pistis Sophia (270-300 c.e.). In the
latter work the Odes are quoted in just the same manner as the canonical Psalms. And Harris has shown 1 that Lactan tius probably took his quotation from a Testimony Book, in which Christian dogma was supported by quotations from the Old Testament. Harris infers that early in the second
century the Odes could be quoted as Scripture. His in ference is cautious, since in his opinion the Testimony Book
in question was pre-Gospel. Hence it would be unreason able to doubt that the Odes are a Jewish work and more nearly related to the Old Testament than to the New. Admittedly the doctrine found in them is farther removed from orthodox Judaism than that of the Wisdom of Solomon.
The conclusion to be drawn from the known facts is that the book was the psalm-book of a non-conformist Jewish sect.
The sharp disagreement of critics as to whether it is Jewish or Christian proves that the circumstances of its origin have
not been understood. A theory which will explain and re concile the difference of opinion has a prima facie claim to favourable consideration. An approximation to the correct solution was reached by Dr. Menzies, who concluded that the Odes are entirely the
work of Jews, but of Gentile — by which we may understand
Hellenistic —Jews with a universalistic outlook. A certain measure of assent can also be given to Harris's opinion that
they are early Christian, but it will first be necessary to answer the question : how early ! Christian in the full sense they certainly are not. Dogmas so characteristically Christian as those of Vicarious Atonement, Justification by Faith, the Resurrection of the Body, including therein the Resurrection of Christ, and a Last Judgment, are entirely
absent from the Odes. The name " Jesus " never occurs. And the writer is completely ignorant, not only of the Gos pels as literature, but of all the details of the Gospel story. Such similarities as commentators have detected lie entirely
1 Work cited, Vol. II, pp. 8 f.



THEIR CHARACTER AND PROBABLE DATE 27
in the region of dogma. Also the dogmas which could be re garded as Christian do not appear to have been derived from any known Christian document; on the contrary, the form in which they are presented seems to be independent
and more primitive. In fact, no doctrine is discoverable which could not have been derived from the Wisdom litera ture, the Psalms, and Isaiah! The assumption that the writer was acquainted with any Christian literature is un necessary and therefore logically unjustifiable. He did not,
indeed, simply take over the doctrine that he found. A noticeable development has been in progress between the date of Wisdom and that of the Odes, but the basic ideas are
essentially the same. In the case of the Psalms it is different ; there the agreement is frequently merely verbal, the Odist using the same words in a different sense, or, where necessary,
varying the phraseology. In order to show how thoroughly
dependent upon the Old Testament he was I will place in parallel columns passages from the Odes and those which suggested them.

It will have been noticed that the Odist hardly ever quotes. His mind was saturated with the knowledge of certain books of the Old Testament, and he brings out that knowledge in his own manner, freely paraphrasing, and expressing his own ideas in language which in its original
context may have had a different meaning. In some cases
the resemblance is slight, and if the resemblances had been few they might be thought to be accidental. But the very large number of them puts coincidence quite out of the
question. For that reason I have considered it necessary to quote copiously. Some early Christian writers quote freely from the Old Testament; but their method is quite different. Their quotations are made with the object of



34 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
proving the correctness of their dogmatic position. And the dogmas they seek to establish are more precisely defined
than those we meet with in the Odes, in which the ideas of the Wisdom literature are in process of being fashioned into a consistent theosophy. The Odist is nearer to his sources than any known Christian writer. He does not employ them in support of doctrine previously existing, but
he is developing a new form of doctrine out of them. In
the mind of the Odist —and no doubt also in the minds of
some of his contemporaries —the ideas of the Wisdom literature have been undergoing modification ; yet there ap pears to be little essentially new. Knowledge of the Psalms has contributed to the development, but these are often too Judaic to be congenial. Hence, while there is frequent reminiscence of the original phraseology, the content is no longer always the same.
It will be worth while noting some differences which illustrate the method of the writer and furnish a clue to his
mental outlook. In Ode XIV we have the paraphrase of a
verse from Ps. cxxiii, where the attitude of men towards God is described as that of servants to their master. Since the Odist regarded the relationship of God to men as that of a loving father to his children, he altered the simile accordingly. But this view of the relationship was not
spontaneously reached by him. It is given in the Wisdom
of Solomon, and that in no narrow Judaic sense. The
loving kindness of God is expressed in some of the Psalms,
and even if there a limitation may have been intended, the Odist, with his universalistic attitude of mind, would neces
sarily transcend it. In the same Ode there is an almost
verbal quotation of the words " he will be our guide even
unto death " from Ps. xlviii. But the Odist objected to the implication contained in the introductory statement that God
is particularly the God of the Jews, " our God " ; so he
turned the statement into a prayer to " my Lord." And,
Jew though he was, God was not for him " my Lord " on that account, as will appear when we examine his doctrine more in detail. His universalistic outlook is indeed apparent in the extracts already given. An indication of this can be



THEIR CHARACTER AND PROBABLE DATE 35
seen particularly in Ode XXXVIII, where the idea of
" planting " has clearly been suggested by Ps. xcii, 13-15.
But the expressions " house of the Lord " and " courts of
our God " are carefully avoided as signifying the temple of
Yahveh at Jerusalem. The writer substitutes " hand of the Lord." Another distinction found here is also important. For the Psalmist life was ended with the death of the body,
so that " fruit-bearing " could not in his view continue
later than " old age." The Odist, who believed in the con
tinuous life of the spirit, corrected his statement into " its fruits are for ever." , The anti-Judaic attitude of the writer is seen in his
avoidance of the words " covenant " and " law." We see
this in Ode XX, but the avoidance is especially marked and
clearly purposive in Ode XLI, where a phrase from Ps. i is almost literally quoted, and where the Odist instead of
" In his law doth he meditate day and might " wrote
" let our hearts meditate in his love day and night." In
Ode XVII the words " I have been delivered from vanity "
seem to have been written with Ps. xxxi, 6 in mind ; and the
suppression of the phrase " I have hated them " may be
taken as an indication that although the Odist did not think
it wrong to pray that the counsel of his persecutors might
recoil upon themselves (Ode V), he did not think it right to
hate anybody. There is in the Odes not the faintest trace of the savagery which disfigures so many of the Psalms.
Another interesting alteration is observable in Ode XVI,
where the writer has corrected the Psalmist's " By the word
of Jehovah were the heavens made " into " the worlds were made by his Word." But in order to preserve the mention
of " the heavens " he added later " his heavenly hosts are subject to his Word." The addition shows that he had the verse of the Psalm in mind when he wrote. The description of the creation in the same Ode, not all of which has been
quoted, was founded upon the two chapters of Job, xxxvii and xxxviii. The chapters have been very freely para phrased and the verbal resemblance is slight; but the ex
pression ' ' treasure chamber " is a reproduction of ' ' treasures ' '
in Job xxxviii, 22. Evidently the writer thought that the



36 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
word treasure would be more appropriately applied to the sun and moon than to snow and hail, since he thought of
God as pre-eminently the giver of " light."
2. They are Gnostic
The second important point to be established is that the
Odes may properly be characterized as Gnostic. If we define
Gnosticism as a system of theosophy of which the kernel is the high value attached to Gnosis, knowledge of God, in a very special sense, including the belief that Gnosis is life, they are unquestionably Gnostic. The thought expressed
in Ecclus. xvii, 7-11 : "He added unto them knowledge
... to show them the majesty of his works, and they shall
praise the name of his holiness," is emphasized and expanded
in Ode VI into : " The Lord has multiplied the knowledge of himself and is zealous that those things should be known which by his grace have been given to us. And the praise
of his name he gave us." Again, in Ode VII we read :
" Knowledge he hath appointed as his way and set over it the footprints of his fight." That Gnosis is the essential condition of salvation and the means of eternal life is a constantly recurring theme. Synonymous terms and meta
phorical expressions for Gnosis are frequently found. It is
truth and it is fight. " His fight has dispelled all darkness
from my face. I have heard his truth." The darkness is
the darkness of ignorance, but ignorance in a special sense.
It is ignorance of the true God, whom not only Pagans but
even Jews have not known. For knowledge of the true
God and of his " ways " is not to be gained from the Pentateuch or the historical books of the Old Testament.
According to Ode XXXIII it was brought to men by
the " Perfect Virgin," Wisdom, or the Holy Spirit, who, though she is said poetically to be proclaiming and calling,
really makes men wise—i.e., imparts Gnosis to them—by entering into them. And this, as we see from the same Ode, is, in accordance with Gnostic doctrine, the condition of
" life." Elsewhere it is the Word of God, the Logos, who is the bringer; and that continued to be the doctrine of



THEIR CHARACTER AND PROBABLE DATE 37
Gnosticism throughout its history. The antitheses of light and darkness, truth and error, so prominent in the Odes, are characteristics of later Gnosticism. There are references to light and truth in the Psalms, but the words have not there the specialized sense which they have acquired in the Odes. This may be seen by a com
parison of the first part of Ode XXXVIII with the verses
upon which it is founded. A single word has been added, but that word makes all the difference. The haven to which the writer is led by the light of truth (the Gnosis) is the
" haven of salvation." The writer has a doctrine of sal vation or redemption; but it is not Catholic Christian
doctrine; it is the Gnostic doctrine that the reception of
Gnosis is the condition of eternal life. In Ode XXXV by
a poetical metaphor Gnosis is likened to the " dew of the
Lord." " The dew of the Lord in quietness he distilled upon me . . . and it was to me for salvation." The word
" dew " is taken from Isaiah, but given a different signifi
cance. In Isaiah the dead are raised and the dew is their
" health." Instead of this the Odist wrote, " it was to me
for salvation," and by " salvation " he meant the eternal
life of the spirit. From Ode XXXIII we see that " redemp
tion " is the same thing as " salvation." " Hear ye me and be redeemed. They who put me on . . . shall possess the new world that is incorrupt." This statement involves the
Gnostic doctrine that only the spirit is capable of " life," and that death of the body is in no real sense death. So
also, when the Odist wrote (Ode V), " if all things visible
should perish I shall not die," he was evidently thinking of himself as an immortal spirit whose life remains unbroken
when the " visible " body perishes. The notion of a death
and resurrection separated by an interval of time during
which the body is dissolved is negatived in Ode XV : " I have put on incorruption through his name. Death has been destroyed before my face and there has gone up death
less life in the Lord's land." The conception of the body
as a perishable garment is found in Ode XXV : "I was
clothed with the covering of thy spirit, and thou didst remove from me my rayment of skin." These quotations



38 THE ODES OF SOLOMON :
express the doctrine that, for the spiritual man, there is no
death and consequently no " resurrection." This is the
doctrine which Justin was condemning when he wrote
(Dial. LXXX, 5) :
If you meet people who call themselves Christians . . .
and who say there is no resurrection of the dead, but that
their souls are raised to Heaven at the moment of their
death, do not consider them to be Christians.
The same Gnostic doctrine was attacked by Tertullian in his treatise De Carnis Resurrectione. Tertullian of course Believed in the immortality of the soul, but in quite a differ ent sense ; and he protested vigorously against the Gnostic antithesis of body and spirit. He argued that not only the soul, but the body also, must go down into Gehenna to be punished, because the body has been a participant in the
actions of the soul. It would have been impossible for him
to write that death had been " destroyed," and to use such
an expression as " deathless life " ; because what he under
stood by death was the termination of the earthly life. In one passage of his argument against the Gnostic view of
death he wrote : " No one can speak of the dead who are in tombs otherwise than as of bodies and flesh." He be
lieved that Jesus by his resurrection had " conquered "
death, not that he had " destroyed " it. Many modern Christians seem to be able to reconcile the Gnostic and the Catholic view, but confused thinking upon this matter was
impossible at the beginning of the Christian era, when it was a subject of keen controversy.
Some theological critics —e.g., Gunkel, von Stolten, and
Bousset —have recognized the Gnostic character of the
Odes, but by others it is disputed on the ground that the Gnostic doctrine of the emanation of ^Eons and the myth of Sophia are not found in them. But so elaborate a set of doctrines as those of the second-century Gnostics did not come into existence full-grown. They must have had a comparatively simple beginning and a rather long period of development. We meet with a simpler form of Gnosti cism in the latter part of the first century, but even there we are clearly not at the beginning. The fact that, while



THEIR CHARACTER AND PROBABLE DATE 39
we find in the Odes some of the basic principles of Gnosticism, we do not find there the fanciful cosmogony of Basilides and Valentinus simply proves that the members of the community O were Gnostics of a primitive type. Pallis 1
describes the Odes as " a collection of Gnostic hymns " and he draws attention to analogies between them and the Mandaean writings, observing, however, that the correspon
dence only proves that the Odes as well as the Mandaean writings belonged to the Gnostic movement. Bousset endeavours to derive Christian Gnosticism from
the East. In the second century there does seem to have been some rather rapid borrowing from Babylonian mytho logy. But that mythology was not simply taken over to build up a system ah initio. Western Gnosticism cannot be explained from oriental borrowings alone. The elements must have been worked into a system already existing. The seven planetary Archons, for example, are not found in the most ancient Jewish Gnostic documents. Bousset con siders that dualism is the distinguishing quality of the
Gnosis. It is true that Gnosticism always was dualistic ; but originally the dualism was not of the oriental type, attributing the supposed evil character of matter to its having been created by a maleficent deity or daemon. Neither in Philo's writings nor in the Wisdom of Solomon nor
in the Odes of Solomon is any such theory discernible,
although the three writers did believe that sin has its root in the imperfection of the flesh. That no doubt was a Gnostic view, but not so distinctively Gnostic as to justify the definition of Gnosticism in terms of it. The name Gnostic was chosen by Gnostics for themselves, and must therefore be taken to indicate that which they themselves held to be their distinguishing mark. And the opinion which, accord
ing to their own belief, separated them from others was that
the possession of Gnosis- —divine knowledge mystically
revealed—is the condition of eternal life. For that reason the Odes of Solomon may properly be termed Gnostic, even
if we were not to take into account their other specifically Gnostic features.
1 Mandcean Studies, p.[163.



40 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
The incorrectness of the opinion that oriental dualism is of the essence of Gnosticism is demonstrable from the example of the Gnostic Ebionites, who believed that the Universe had been created by God. They attributed sin to the instigation of daemons. Jewish belief in daemons may have come from Babylon, but that belief was by no means confined to Gnostics. Further proof that this type of dualism is not primitive in Jewish Gnosticism is found in the fact that in an early book of the Naassenes men are said to have been
spontaneously produced from the earth. In connection with this statement we find the pure unadulterated Gnostic doctrine that the cause of vice is ignorance of God. That is substantially the doctrine of the Wisdom of Solomon, which
teaches that in order to be virtuous men must get " wisdom,"
which in later Gnostic parlance = Gnosis. In the early
Naassene doctrine, moreover, the " Chaos," the basis of material things, is poured forth from the Self-born, the divine \origin of all things. There is no oriental dualism in the earliest discoverable cosmogony of these Gnostics. There is
also evidence that creation by an " Archon " was not part of the original doctrine of the Peratai. Bousset makes a good deal of the fact that the antithesis
of light and darkness is a feature of the oriental as it is of
the Christian Gnosticism. In the Odes of Solomon light is
frequently named as a quality of God and " darkness " appears as a synonym of error. But there is no reason for deriving these ideas directly from the East; they would easily occur to a religious thinker and they are given in the
Wisdom of Solomon, the Psalms, and Isaiah. In chap, lx,
verses 1-3, of the Prophet the dissipation of religious darkness by the light which is to shine forth from Israel is foretold,
and in Ps. xxxvi, 9, we read : " In thy light shall we see fight." We may term the ideas in question Gnostic, but they were derivable by early Jewish Gnostics from Jewish sources, some of which no doubt had been influenced by Greek or
Helleno-Egyptian thought. In the later Gnosticism these ideas became much more definite and Persian influence may be accountable for that. Light is no longer merely a quality
of God j it has become a name in regular use both for the



THEIB CHARACTER AND PROBABLE DATE 41
Supreme Being and for the Saviour. Prayers are addressed to Zoe (Life) and Phos (Light). We may infer an early date
for the Odes of Solomon from the fact that in them this stage
has not been reached. God is thought of as " Life " and
" Light," but the latter name in particular has not become stereotyped as a title for him, and neither of them is applied to the Word at all. Later Gnostics again superimposed upon their doctrine of Redemption an apparatus of magical rites by which they thought redemption could be more certainly secured. The Marcosians are particularly mentioned by Irenaeus as having done this, but he says that some of them kept to the original idea that Gnosis alone was the redemption of the inner man.1 W. Anz 2 holds that the significance of Gnosis is to be learnt from the definition contained in the Naassene Hymn.
If so the Odes could perhaps hardly be classed as Gnostic.
But the difference between Gnosis in the Odes and in the hymn is not generic ; it is specific. The connotation in the latter is fuller and more complex, but the fundamental
significance is the same. In both, Gnosis is a special kind of saving knowledge divinely revealed. Possession of it is the
one and only means of redemption. In the later conception of Gnosis, upon the knowledge of the nature of God and of the conditions of salvation appointed by him was grafted the knowledge of certain incantations and secret names available for the quelling of daemons and planetary powers. The content of Gnosis was enlarged, but its essential character and purpose were not changed. The mistake of Anz and Bousset, right as they are in many respects, consists in their
not having taken account of the Jewish sources of pre-Chris
tian Jewish Gnosticism. A distinction between Jewish and oriental Gnosticism may legitimately be made. The former is traceable to the Wisdom of Solomon, and the foreign
influence which shaped it is mainly Greek. Post-exilic Jews had knowledge of the Babylonian and Persian religions, but
for the purpose of the present inquiry it is unnecessary to go farther back than the Wisdom literature. That the funda

D—G.O.



42 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
mental doctrine of the Odist is the saving power of knowledge of truth divinely revealed is abundantly demonstrated in the Odes. The evidence previously given may be supplemented
from Ode XXXVIII :
Truth set me on the arms of immortal life ; and it went
with me and made me rest and suffered me not to wander,
because it was the truth. And I did not make an error in
anything because I obeyed the truth. . . . Whatever I did
not know it made clear to me, all the plagues of error and
the plagues of death, which are thought to be sweetness.
And I was made wise so as not to fall into the hands of the
deceiver; and I congratulated myself because the truth
went with me, and I was 'established and lived and was redeemed.
This is merely an expansion and accentuation of what is said about Wisdom in the Wisdom books. To become wise is to follow divine truth and be redeemed. The later Gnostic fables concerning the emanation and passion of Sophia were elaborated from Plato and other sources, but the basic ideas that she was an emanation from the Pleroma and that through her a spark of the divine spirit was imparted to men
are given in Wisdom (vii, 25, 27) :
. [Wisdom] is a clear effluence of the glory of the Almighty,
from generation to generation passing into holy souk.
This doctrine is found in the Odes of Solomon in the form that
the Word, a spiritual emanation from God, becomes in corporated in the saints. Gnosticism was consistently anti-Judaic and it disparaged
the Old Testament. Catholic Christianity, although it rejected institutional Judaism, and in spite of its condemna tion of the Jews, accepted the Old Testament as divinely inspired and absorbed in considerable quantity Judaic
ideas.1 The Odes of Solomon are anti- Judaic in the same
sense as the Gnostics were. Direct allusion to the Old Testament, other than to the Prophets, the Psalms, and
1 " There are various grounds for the opinion that the polemic of
the Gnosis against the Old Testament and Judaism has deeper roots
in its own general outlook than in the contacts with Christianity."

THEIR CHARACTER AND PROBABLE DATE 43
the Wisdom books, is extremely doubtful. The implication
of Gen. iii, 5, appears to be deliberately contradicted in Ode
XVIII : " Evil thou knowest not, nor doth it know thee." To the evidence of anti-Judaism previously given may be
added an interesting example from Ode XXV : "I became
the Lord's. by the name of the Lord." The reader who has compared the passages quoted from the Odes with the corres ponding passages of the Old Testament will have observed
that in every case where the term " the Lord " is used it means God. That is the writer's almost invariable rule, as it is the rule in the books he used. Hence the assumption of
some commentators that " the Lord " in the phrase above quoted must mean Christ [= Jesus] and that the Odist
intended to say that he was named a Christian after Christ is
entirely gratuitous. His meaning and intention can be
interpreted from Isa. xliv, 5 :
One shall say, I am Jehovah's; and another shall call
himself by the name of Jacob ; and another shall subscribe
himself with his hand unto Jehovah, and surname himself
by the name of Israel.
The meaning of this is that, as one of the chosen people, a man could claim to be Jehovah's by the name of Jacob or of
Israel. In accordance with his anti-Judaism and with his
belief that the congregation of the saints —not necessarily all
of them Jews —had superseded the congregation of Israel as
the chosen of God, the writer substitutes " the name of the
Lord " for " the name of Jacob " or "of Israel." His motive for making the statement he did was to emphasize his conviction that not because he was an Israelite was he the Lord's ; otherwise he would not have had to become the Lord's, he would have been the Lord's already. The verse of Isaiah may not, however, have been the writer's only in
centive. In his day very great importance was ascribed to names, especially to divine names, which were kept secret and believed to have mystical efficacy. The Egyptians thought that any one who knew the secret name of a god acquired an influence over him, as though he possessed a part
of the god himself. In a Gnostic prayer occur the words " I
know thy name." It is evident from several passages in the



44 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
Odes that the writer of them in some measure shared this view
of the mystical power of the divine name. For example, " I
have put on incorruption through his name," in Ode XV.
The point of his remark is further illustrated by a verse in the
Psalms of Solomon (IX, 17) : " Thou hast chosen the seed of
Abraham rather than all the Gentiles, and thou hast put on
us thy name, O Lord." Here it is plainly stated that the name was given to the people because they had been chosen.
The Odist says the exact opposite, " We, whether Jews or
Gentiles, became the elect by putting on the name." If it
could be inferred —and, as will appear later, there is some
slight evidence of it—that the Odist and the Psalmist occasionally wrote a verse controversially, the one against the other, the inference would help very much in fixing the approximate date of composition of the Odes.
3. Their Probable Date
The question of date cannot be finally decided until the doctrine of the Odes has been examined in detail. From what has been so far written the reader will probably have gained the impression that they must be early. From the fact that they were at one time included among the books of the Old Testament one may infer that they were written before the year 70, after which date Jewry became Pharisaic and all Jewish writings deemed heterodox were proscribed. Only those which Christians found more or less congenial have survived. And since the community O, like the Essenes, the Therapeuts, and the Mandaeans, was certainly a Jewish
sect, though a heterodox one, it must have been in existence for some time before the capture of Jerusalem by Titus. After that event no Hellenistic Jews can have been allowed within the pale of Jewry, which then took on the very
exclusive character that it has preserved until now ; and no Hellenistic sect can have come into existence within it. The very primitive character of the Gnosticism, which has closer affinity with the doctrine of the Wisdom of Solomon
than with that of the earliest Gnostic heretics known to us, indicates a date which cannot be later than the middle of the



THEIR CHARACTER AND PROBABLE DATE 45
first century and may be a good deal earlier. The WisdomWord doctrine of the Odes seems to have grown up in the same region of Jewish Hellenistic speculation which produced the Sophia-Logos doctrine of Philo ; but in Philo the doctrine is seen to have reached a somewhat later stage of its develop ment. W. Bousset detects in Philo's doctrine the direct influence of that oriental mysticism which is so much more evident in the later Gnosticism; but the advance in com plexity observable in passing from the Wisdom of Solomon to
the Odes is so slight that a considerable interval of time between the dates of composition of these two works is improbable. We could thus reasonably infer for the Odes a date not later than the early years of the first century. Hamack came to the conclusion that in their original form they were produced somewhere about the year 30 ; and the bias of theologians being to date them as late as possible, this
date could be taken as the lower limit. It was in fact so taken by Grimme, according to whom they were written
between the years 100 B.C. and 30 c.e. It is, however, possible to bring his limits closer together, since the Wisdom of Solomon must have been known to the writer, and some
time must be allowed for development, on which ground 80 may be substituted for Grimme's upper limit of 100 B.C., and there is reason to think that his lower limit is rather too low. The facts that in the ancient catalogues the Psalms and the Odes of Solomon are always coupled together and that in the
extant MSS. they are bound up together and even numbered right through consecutively, the first of the Psalms being
numbered XLIII to follow the last of the Odes, which is XLII,
may be taken as an indication that they were produced in approximately the same period. Similarities in thought and expression are perceptible, as though they had been moulded under a common influence. The fundamental religious outlook is certainly very different ; but the Psalms, in spite of their Judaic character, appear to have been influenced to a certain degree by the religious thought which has expressed itself in the Wisdom of Solomon. They agree
with the Odes in the denial of a resurrection for the body and



46 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
in proclaiming the immortality of the soul. For comparison a few verses from the Psalms are appended.
The life of the righteous is for ever. But sinners shall be
cast into perdition and their memorial shall no more be
found. Those who fear the Lord shall rise to eternal life and their
life shall be in the light of the Lord and shall not fail any
more.
The hope of the poor and miserable, who is it except thy
self, 0 Lord ? And thou wilt answer him because thou art
kind and gentle.
Blessed is the man who is prepared to call upon the name
of the Lord and when he shall remember the name of the
Lord he will be saved.
With the last verse may be compared particularly the
phrase in Ode XXV, quoted above : "I became the Lord's
by the name of the Lord." And in some of the Odes we read
of the " kindness " and the " gentleness " of the Lord. But
the resemblances go sufficiently beyond generality to make it probable that the writer of one of the works was acquainted
with the other, and it seems even not impossible that passages in at least two of the Psalms are dependent upon passages in
the Odes. It is known from internal evidence that the Psalms were composed over a series of years during which occurred the capture of Jerusalem by Pompey, and in
Psalm II the death of Pompey (b.c. 48) is referred to. In the
opinion of the best critics the probable limits of date are 70 and 40 B.C. Now as there are forty-two Odes, compared with
eighteen Psalms, it is likely that the composition of the former also extended over a period of years, in which case the periods could have overlapped, so that a few of the Psalms might have been written at a later date than the oldest of the Odes.
In Psalm XIV we find the following :
The Paradise of the Lord are the trees of life which are his
saints. And the planting of them is sure for ever ; nor shall
they be rooted up all the days of the heavens. For the
portion of the Lord and his inheritance is Israel. Not so
are the sinners and evil men.
If these verses are compared with those previously quoted
from Ode XXXVIII, it will be seen that both passages are



THEIR CHARACTER AND PROBABLE DATE 47
based upon the canonical Psalms lii and xcii; but there is a curious divergence in the case of the Solomonic Psalm.
In the Ode, as in the canonical Psalm, the righteous man is likened to a fruitful tree, a natural and appropriate simile. But in the Solomonic Psalm we have a reference to Para dise, in which the saints are said to be the trees of life. We may therefore inquire whence the Psalmist derived this idea ;
and on searching the Odes we find in Ode XX mention of
Paradise and of the tree of the Lord growing therein. If
there is dependence here it is the Psalmist who was dependent on the Odist. Venturing a little farther, however, and specu
lating as to the motive of the writer, we may perhaps detect it in the rather unnecessary emphasis with which, unless he was writing controversially, he asserts that the saints in Paradise, the portion of the Lord and his inheritance, are the people of Israel. The Odist, with his universalistic outlook, invites all who will put on the grace of the Lord to come into his
Paradise and make a garland from his tree. It is possible to
imagine the Psalmist objecting to this and replying : " No ! the trees of life are not for any one to pluck. The trees of life are the saints and the saints are the chosen of Israel." The identification of the saints with the trees of life in Paradise is
very artificial. It is decidedly more natural to think of the tree of life as one from which can be gathered a life-giving
garland. So far as it goes, therefore, the comparison appears to indicate the priority of the Ode.
There is a reference to Paradise also in Ode XI :
He carried me into his Paradise. Blessed, 0 Lord, are
they that are planted in thy land and that have a place in
thy Paradise ; and that grow in the growth of thy trees.
The first and last lines show that in this passage the saints are not identified with the trees that grow in Paradise. The
word " planted " is thus only a figurative way of saying that the saints are placed by the Lord in his Paradise and established there.
Another case is in Ode XLI, a verse from which —" his
children will be known to him "—was previously compared
with Ps. of Sol. XVII, 30, which there is reason to believe to



48 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
be of comparatively late date. The thought of the Odist is one which would be quite natural to him, and there is not the slightest reason to suppose that it was suggested by the corresponding verse of the Psalm, in which the thought is, in fact, not the same. The statement expresses the writer's universalism ; the meaning is that God knows his own
children, of whatever race they may happen to be. It would not have been necessary to say that God knew his own chosen people, the Jews. The Psalmist, however, is writing
of the holy people —Jews, of course —who will be gathered together by the Messiah, and then he says, rather unneces
sarily : " For he knoweth them all that they are the
children of God." Here again, if there is a dependence, there is a slight presumption that the Ode was written earlier than the Psalm. These coincidences seem to create some measure of proba bility, but their character is not such as to admit of a con fident inference with regard to the relative priority of the Psalms and Odes in question. Reviewing the evidence as
a whole, however, we may find in it sufficient justification for a constriction of Grimme's limits at least so far as to place the composition of the Odes in the period between the year 80 B.C. and the closing years of the last pre-Chris tian century. When we have examined the doctrine of
the Odes more minutely and compared it with that of the oldest Christian documents, we shall obtain confirmation of this dating. The Odist was bilingual, for though the best opinion seems to be that he wrote in Syriac and used both Hebrew and Syriac sources, in some passages there is evidence of the use of the Greek Septuagint. This circumstance could be explained by supposing that there was more than one writer. The unity of style might then perhaps be due to the fact that phraseology of a certain kind had become stereotyped in the community. Some slight variation of doctrine is observable, though hardly sufficient to prove that the Odes were not all
written by the same person. It might be accounted for by the supposition that the period of composition extended over a number of years ; or that the doctrine was still somewhat



THEIR CHARACTER AND PROBABLE DATE 49
fluid, not yet having crystallized into rigidly defined dogmas.
A critical investigation free from existing prepossessions is desirable. Harris gives reasons for thinking that the place of com position of the Odes was Antioch. They seem to have been
known to Ignatius. An interesting piece of evidence is the
mention in Ode VI of " speaking waters." Harris points
out that there was a " speaking fountain " at Daphne, a suburb of Antioch. The expression is found also in the
Ignatian Epistle to the Romans, 7 : " Living and speaking
water." It is worth noting in this connection that accord ing to the Acts of the Apostles there was at Antioch at a very early date an important community of Christians who
had rejected the Mosaic Law. Paul, it appears, was a teacher in this church, which is said to have consisted prin cipally of Greeks. Nothing can be inferred from the state ments in Acts with regard to the date of its foundation, or its primitive doctrine.



CHAPTER III
THE ODES OF SOLOMON: THEIR DOCTRINE
1. The Indwelling Word and Gnosis
To understand properly the doctrine of the Odes of Solomon
it is necessary continually to bear in mind that the composer of them was a poet and a mystic. Commentators have erred
through taking him too literally. A poet will personify
abstractions, and a mystic will see them as something con crete ; and in the minds of the Jewish mystics the boundary between poetic metaphor and the concrete representation of an abstract quality was fluctuating and ill-defined.
There were Gnostics who personified the " Beginning "
which appears in the first verse of Genesis. In Proverbs and the Wisdom of Solomon Wisdom is pictured as a woman
who seeks, loves, and proclaims ; but the writer of Wisdom at any rate did not really believe she was a woman, although for him she was something more than an abstraction. She was an all-pervasive spirit which enters into the souls of the
pious and makes them wise. In the Odes of Solomon it is
the Word who does this ; and though the Odist sometimes
writes of him as if he were a person, he is no more a man in the Odes than the Wisdom of the earlier writer was a woman. The vivid imagination of a writer for whom ab
stractions had a real existence, like the " Ideas " of Plato, and who personified Grace and Truth, may possibly have visualized the Word as a man, but never as a man who had lived upon the earth. The writer's doctrine, concisely stated, was that the Word, like the Wisdom whose place he had taken, is a spiritual emanation from God, unlimited in space and capable of entering into the minds or the souls of men. This view of the Word and the substitution of the Word for Wisdom is quite possibly due to Egyptian influence; for in ancient Egyptian thought the spoken word had objective reality. The highest god was believed
50



THE ODES OF SOLOMON: THEIR DOCTRINE 51
to have " uttered " the inferior gods —i.e., brought them
into being by speaking their names. In a very ancient
Egyptian hymn preserved in the British Museum it is said
that " All men, all cattle, all reptiles live because Ptah
thinks and utters whatever he will." The thought [=
Wisdom] and the utterance [= Word] are personified as
Horus and Thot respectively, but in the mystical doctrine of the writer they are not separable from Ptah.1
In Ode XII it is written : " The dwelling-place of the
Word is man." The writer does not say and he cannot mean that the Word dwells among men. He is saying of
the Word what had been previously said about Wisdom that from generation to generation she passes into holy souls. The statement might be taken to imply that Wisdom is multiple; the writer guards against the misconception
by saying in the same verse (Wis. vii, 27) : " And she, being
one, hath power to do all things." We may see from this example that we are moving in a realm of thought where logical precision is not to be demanded. The writer of the Odes to a greater extent than the writer of Wisdom is endeavouring to express metaphysical conceptions in the language of metaphor, the only kind of language in which they can be expressed ; and, unless we can bring our minds into tune with his mysticism, his concrete representation of abstractions, and the mentality of the ancient world in general, we shall never understand him. The Wisdom
literature will frequently furnish a clue to the real thought
which lies hidden beneath his symbolic language. A phrase
in Ode XLI which has been misinterpreted by some com
mentators — " the Christ is truly one " —is illuminated by the verse of Wisdom referred to above. The Christ [= the
Word] is said by the Odist to be truly one for the same
reason as that for which Wisdom was said to be one. In the soul of every holy man the Word has his dwelling-place ; nevertheless the Word is not multiple but truly one. The same conception is found in the doctrine of" the Sabians, a Mesopotamian sect. As they expressed it, the
1 Reitzenstein, Poimandres, p. 63. The word of God is objectified
in Ps. cxlvii, 15 : " His word runneth very swiftly."



52 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
Creator is both single and multiple. He is one as regards his essential nature, priority of existence, and eternity, but multiple in that he diffuses himself throughout the material forms into which he enters, especially the bodies of good,
wise, and distinguished men.1 Although no mention of this sect is found before the rise of Mohammedanism, with which it came into conflict, its doctrine, as Reitzenstein has shown, is traceable to the Helleno-Egyptian theosophy of the first century and earlier. Since the divine Wisdom could be regarded as the Thought of God, it would be easy
to assimilate the Word to the Thought of which it is the ex
pression. In this manner in some of the Hermetic writings, the doctrine of which is pre-Christian in origin, Logos was identified with Nous, the divine Mind. The substitution of
" the Word " for " Wisdom " appears in another verse
of Ode XLI by comparison of the statement that " he [the
Christ] 2 was known before the foundation of the world,"
with Prov. viii, 24 : " When there were no depths I [Wisdom]
was brought forth."
The thought that righteous men are the dwelling-place
of the Word recurs in Ode XXXII :
To the blessed there is joy from their hearts, and light
from him that dwells in them; the Word from the Truth
who was self-originate. For he is strengthened by the holy
power of the Most High and he is unshakable for ever and
ever.
The Word in these Odes is " the Saviour," but not through
a vicarious sacrifice and " atonement." He saves men by bringing to them the knowledge of the true God ; not by teaching them as the word teaching is ordinarily understood,
but by entering into them. In Ode XII we read :
He hath caused his knowledge to abound in me, because
the mouth of the Lord is the true Word and the door of his
light ; and the Most High hath given it to his worlds. The
swiftness of the Word cannot be expressed . . . and they
were penetrated by the Word, and they knew him who
made them.
1 Reitzenstein, Poim., p. 169.
* The significance of the term " the Christ " in these Odes will be
considered later.



THEIR DOCTRINE 53
The phrase " the swiftness of the Word " is noteworthy because it shows that, however the Word may be poetically personified, he is really conceived as an all-pervasive,
" penetrating " Spirit. This appears clearly on a compari
son with Wisdom :
For Wisdom is more mobile than any motion. Yea, she
pervadeth and penetrateth all things (Wis. vii, 24).
Substitute " the Word " for " Wisdom " in this quotation, and you have the doctrine of the Odist. To complete the comparison Wis. i, 7, and
ii,
10 may be quoted
:

The Spirit of the Lord [Wisdom] hath filled the world.
When Wisdom entereth into thy heart .
.
. understanding
shall keep thee.
It
is
a proof of the very early date of these Odes that al
though on the whole " the Word " has replaced " Wisdom," yet the thought of the writer sometimes fluctuates between the two in a way which would have been impossible for a
" Christian." Since each of them
is
" the Spirit of the Lord," either term may be used. The substitution has, however, advanced so far that the name Wisdom
is
not actually
found. That Wisdom
is
meant
is
clearly perceptible by comparison with the Wisdom
of
Solomon or with Proverbs. The difference
is
rather one of aspect than an essential
difference. In one or two places the distinction
is
made for the purpose of illustrating some point in the writer's theosophy. But
it
is
quite possible that a gradual re orientation of doctrine was in progress during the period over which the Odes were composed. One example occurs
in a passage of Ode XXXIII previously quoted, where
it
is
said that a " perfect virgin " enters into the sons and daugh ters of men to make them wise, that they perish not. This virgin
is
obviously Wisdom. In Ecclus. vi, 31,
it
is
said
:
" Thou shalt put her on as a robe of glory." " Putting her
on "
is
another way of saying " taking her in." And we find the same variation of expression in reference to the
Word in Ode VII
:
"He was reckoned like myself in order that
I
might put him on."



54 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
According to the ancient mode of thinking the spirit which entered into a body would take the shape of the
body.1 Hence in order that the Word might be " put on "
he was " reckoned like myself." The same thought is found
in Ode VI :
As the hand moves over the harp and the strings speak,
so speaks in my members the Spirit of the Lord, and I speak
by his Jove.
The Spirit of the Lord which " speaks " is the Word.
Gnosis and " life " are acquired through " union " with the Spirit of God by the person into whom the Word has
entered. Thus in Ode III :
He that is joined to him that is immortal will also himself
become immortal. . . . This is the Spirit of the Lord which
doth not lie, which teacheth the sons of men to know his ways.
The supreme value of Gnosis and its life-giving power are
illustrated in various forms of speech. In Ode VI it is the
water of life :
All the thirsty upon earth were given to drink [of it];
and thirst was done away and quenched. For from the
Most High the draught was given.
We may compare with this Prov. xvi, 22 : " Under
standing is a well-spring of life." Again, in Ode XXX :
Fill ye for yourselves from the living fountain of the
Lord. ... It flows forth from the lips of the Lord and from
the heart of the Lord is its name. And it came infinitely
and invisibly ; and until it was given in the midst they did
not know it.
Note particularly the last sentence. It teaches that Gnosis, the knowledge of God, did not come through audible or visible instruction, neither through the voice of a man
nor the letters of a book —hence not from the Old Testament.
The doctrine is the doctrine of mystics in all ages—viz.,
1 This mode of thinking is not yet obsolete, since the " ghost " of
a person is supposed to be a facsimile of that person.



THEIR DOCTRINE 55
that God must be immediately known by spiritual intuition.
For the Odist it is the Spirit of the Lord, the Word of God, who imparts the knowledge of God by an inward communi cation with the mind or the soul of the person who receives him. Since the word of God is the expression of the divine mind, there is no clear separation between the Word, the
Will, and the Thought of God. " The Word of the Lord and his Will is a holy Thought . . . and his Thought is an
everlasting life." It is plain that we are not dealing here
with the realities of the material world but with metaphysical
abstractions. With the phrase, " it flows forth from the
lips of the Lord," we may compare : "I came forth from the
mouth of the Most High " (Ecclus. xxiv, 3). Whether the
writer of Ecclesiasticus thought of God as having a mouth
it is rather difficult to say. From his statement that God made man according to his own image one might infer that he did. The writer of Wisdom, on the other hand, says that
God made men an image of his own " proper being," or,
according to some authorities, of his own " everlastingness," which looks like a deliberate correction of the account in Genesis. The Odist had certainly rejected that story, and
since his God was spirit, he can have written " the lips of
the Lord " only as poetic metaphor. This may seem too obvious to call for mention ; but, in view of the fact that some commentators have erred through a tendency to literal
interpretation, it seems necessary to reiterate and emphasize a caution with respect to the symbolic character of the writing. The being, or beings, whom the writer worshipped, in spite of occasional personification or metaphorical materi alization, are spiritual beings, or rather spiritual substances, since for the ancient mind spirit was attenuated matter. We may go farther and say that essentially they are meta physical abstractions more or less concretely conceived and represented.
Comparison of the above-quoted phrase from Ode XXX
with the corresponding verse of Ecclesiasticus shows that in
the former " the Lord," as usual in the Odes, means God.
We may also interpret the giving " in the midst " from verse
2 of the same chapter, where it is said : " In the congregation



56 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
of the Most High shall she open her mouth." Gnosis is
likened also to dew in Ode XXXV :
The dew of the Lord in quietness he distilled upon me . . .
it was to me for salvation . . . and I was made right with
the Most High and I was redeemed with him.
Note again how the distillation " in quietness " indicates
a spiritual infusion. In other Odes Gnosis is " milk " which came from the breasts of the Father. Evidently poetical metaphor. God in these Odes is spirit, unconfined in space and capable of unlimited extension. He is therefore able to pass into the souls of men. By the designation
" Spirit of the Lord " we are to understand this same Spirit.
In reality there is only one. But the writer, holding the Gnostic view that God would be contaminated by direct contact with matter, distinguishes between the Most High, the Spirit which remains in Heaven, and the Word, that extension of the divine Spirit which enters into the souls of men. We read of the Father, the Holy Spirit, and the
Word, but we should make a great mistake if we were to suppose that the writer had any knowledge, or even thought,
of the Christian dogma of the Trinity ; though it is quite likely we here have the germ of it. There are not three
persons in one person. Strictly speaking, there is no " per
son " at all. There is one Spirit which is viewed under different aspects. Just as the Word, though present in
many, is " truly one," so is the Word one with the Most High. That portion of the divine Spirit which becomes
incarnate in men is termed " the Word," " Grace," " the
Light of Truth," the " Thought," or the " Will " of God.
The Word is God as he directly affects men—the spiritual link, so to speak, by which men become united with the immediately unknowable Most High, and so get knowledge of him. The statement is made categorically and without
possibility of misconception in Ode VII : " The Father of Gnosis is the Word of Gnosis." Like Wisdom the Word is
A vapour of the power of God and a clear effluence of the
glory of the Almighty ... an effulgence from everlasting
light (Wis. vii, 25).



THEIR DOCTRINE 57
—consequently a portion of the divine Spirit. The same
conclusion can be drawn from Ode XXXII previously quoted,
where it is said that he in whom the Word has a dwelling
place " is strengthened by the holy power of the Most High."
2. The Term " The Lord "
Commentators who come to the study of these Odes with the determination of finding in them the Jesus of the Gospels, than which there is no more certain way of failing to under
stand them, take the term " the Lord " wherever there is
the slightest possibility of doubt — and sometimes when
there is none—as referring to a human Christ. The term
occurs very frequently, but in one Ode only —Ode XXXI-
does it appear necessary to take it as referring to the Word ; and there is a possible explanation of the apparent exception. Considering the intimate dependence of the Odes upon the
Wisdom books and the Psalms, in which of course " the
Lord " always means God, the sound critical principle is to understand the term as meaning God wherever there is no clear evidence to the contrary. Since the Odes are the production of a sphere of religious thought which contributed to the growth of Christian doctrine, we necessarily find in them ideas and phrases which are reproduced in the later Christian literature; but frequently when such is the case the expression of these ideas recurs with some modification or development indicative of progress in the thought. And a similar transformation is observable when we go back to the literature in which the religious ideas of the Odes had
their birth. Consider, for example, the phrase " I know
that my redeemer liveth " (Job xix, 25). This phrase of
course was written of God and the writer had no thought of the Christian doctrine of redemption through Christ.
In the Odes also God is Redeemer, Saviour, and the " Living One," and it is necessary to beware of the assumption that
the term " the Saviour " has any relation to Jesus.1 Here,
1 In Ps. of Sol. also God is several times called " Saviour ".
e.g., Ill, 7 : " The stability of the righteous is from God their
Saviour."
E—G.O.



58 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
however, an advance in thought has occurred. The Word is the means by which God has offered salvation to men ; . for by union with the Word they become united with God and
thus secure eternal life. It is natural and easy but quite uncritical for people, when they meet in the Odes with certain stereotyped Christian terms and phrases, to impute a developed Christology which is entirely foreign to them.
A case in point is found in Ode III, where it is written :
" I should not have known how to love the Lord, if he had not loved me." The insecurity of the assumption that
" the Lord " in this statement means Christ is seen by com
parison with Ode XVI, 3 : " For my love is the Lord." It
is quite plain from the verses which follow that " the Lord "
here is the Most High :
And therefore I will sing to him. ... I will open my
mouth and his spirit will utter in me the glory of the Lord
and his beauty ; the work of his hands and the fabric of his
fingers ; and the multitude of his mercies, and the strength
of his Word.1
As a matter of fact, the continuation of Ode III, from which
" I should not have known how to love the Lord, etc.," was
quoted, makes the matter clear. For immediately following
these words we read, " I love the Beloved." " The Beloved "
is plainly " the Lord," who had been mentioned just before.
Then the Odist continues : " And my soul loves him, and
where his rest is, there also am I." We may see that " the
rest " is God's rest by comparison with Ps. xcv, 11. And any possible doubt is banished by the next verse of the Ode,
" And I shall be no stranger there—sc. in " his rest," —for
with the Lord Most High and merciful there is no grudging."
Then there follows immediately : "I have been united with
him." The " him " can only be the Lord Most High.
Finally we read in verse 9 : " And he that hath pleasure in the Living One will become living." Thus we have in all desirable clarity the writer's doctrine of salvation. Salva tion, or redemption, is the attainment of the certainty of
1 The phraseology here, as elsewhere, is reminiscent of the phraseo
logy of the Psalms; it has very little affinity anywhere to that of
the New Testament.



THEIR DOCTRINE 59
eternal life through union with the Living One, who is the Lord Most High. But, as pointed out previously, the union
is secured through the mediation of the Word —also termed
the Spirit of the Lord —who enters into the soul of the wor shipper, incidentally bringing to him the knowledge of the
otherwise unknowable God. The Word is named " the
Christ," but he is certainly not regarded as " a person."
He is also termed " the Saviour " in Ode XLI :
His Word is with us all our way, the Saviour who makes
alive and does not reject our souls.
The final phrase can be interpreted from an Ode (VII)
previously quoted. It probably means that the Word does
not disdain to enter into the souls of men. It could be said
that he humbles himself. But if there are any interpola tions at all in these Odes the immediately following sentence
—" The man who was humbled and exalted by his own
righteousness " —is certainly one. The phrase jars with its context like a false note in music. Nowhere else at all is
the Word called " a man," and such a designation is totally at variance with the writer's doctrine. Nor do we anywhere
else find " righteousness," or any similar human quality,
ascribed to the Word. He is not " righteous " but the cause of righteousness in men. He might be thought of as a per
sonification of the abstract quality of righteousness ; but it is very significant that the term is never used in connection with him ; rather is he, as a divine being, the personification
of " grace " and " truth," and the bringer of " light " and
" life." The quoted phrase suggests the mentality of a Christian of the second or late first century. Grammati cally it is completely detachable from its context. The practical identification of the Word with God is found in
Ode XXIX :
I believed in the Lord's Christ; and it appeared to me
that he [i.e., the Christ] is the Lord [= God].
It is plain from this identification that the Word must have been conceived as Spirit; we have seen in fact that
" the Word " and " the Spirit of the Lord " are synonymous



60 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
terms ; and there is no doctrine of " incarnation " discover able anywhere other than the doctrine of the incarnation of the Word in God's elect, the congregation of the saints.
In Ode XIV we read : " Let thy meekness, O Lord, abide with me." Meekness is a quality so frequently ascribed to Jesus in Christian literature that a Christian on reading this phrase is naturally inclined to assume that here at any rate we have a prayer addressed to Christ and that the writer may have been thinking of the Jesus of the Gospels. But the verses which follow show that the assumption would
have been wrong :
Teach me the Psalms of thy truth, that I may bring forth
fruit in thee ; and open to me the harp of thy Holy Spirit
that I may praise thee.
Evidently the Lord who is addressed is God. To apply
the term " meekness " to God would be quite natural for a writer so well acquainted with the Psalms as the Odist
was, for in Ps. xviii, 35, we read, " thy meekness hath made
me great," addressed to God. The writer—as Harnack
concluded —was certainly unacquainted with any Gospel and there is no evidence at all that his Christ was derived in the slightest degree from a knowledge of the Christian Jesus. Consequently any attempt to interpret the Odes in the light of qualities or epithets conventionally connected with Jesus can only lead us astray. 1 We are now in a position
to examine in closer detail the important Ode VII.
2. My joy is the Lord and my impulse is towards him.
3. This path of mine is excellent, for I have a helper, the
Lord. 4. He hath caused me to know himself without grudging by his simplicity; his kindness hath humbled
his greatness. 5. He became like me in order that I might
receive him ; 6. He was reckoned like myself that I might
put him on. 7. And I trembled not when I saw him,
because he was gracious to me. 8. Like my nature he
became that I might learn him, and like my form that I
might not turn back from him. 9. The Father of Gnosis
is the Word of Gnosis. 10. He who created wisdom is
1 Cp. Ps. of Sol. v. The hope of the poor and miserable, who is
it except thyself, O Lord ? And thou wilt answer him because
thou art kind and gentle.



THEIR DOCTRINE 61
wiser than his works, for knowledge he hath appointed as
his way. 11. And he who created me when yet I was not,
knew what I should do when I came into being ; wherefore
he pitied me in his abundant grace ; and granted me to ask
from him and to receive from his sacrifice. 13. Because he
it is that is incorrupt, the fulness of the ages and the Father
of them. 14. He hath given himself to be seen of them
that are his, in order that they may recognize him who
made them.
The language of the Ode is highly poetical and metapho
rical. In spite of the terms " simplicity " and " kindness,"
" the Lord " is God all through, " he who created me when
yet I was not." Compare, for example, verses 4 and 10 :
" He hath caused me to know himself without grudging . . . for knowledge he hath appointed as his way." The
subject of the second of these sentences is " the Father of
Gnosis," " he who created wisdom," whence we must infer that it is the Father who "caused me to know himself." The same conclusion is reached from a comparison of verses
7 and 14. In the latter verse it is obviously the Father who
" hath given himself to be seen " ; consequently the subject of verse 7 must also be the Father. The English versions
of the Odes read " him " instead of " himself " in verse 14; but that makes nonsense and is grammatically untenable.
There is no previously-mentioned person to whom " him " can refer ; and the Creator could not cause people to recog
nize " him who made them " by showing them someone
else. Wellhausen translated the phrase correctly, " Er lasst sich schauen von den Seinen." And when we compare
" he hath given himself to be seen " with " he hath caused
me to know himself " in verse 4 we obtain confirmation of
the opinion that in that verse also " He " is God. We are
also given to understand that " seeing " is poetically written
for knowing, just as in Wis. vi, 12, it is written of Wisdom
that " easily is she beheld by those who love her." The
writer had never literally " seen " Wisdom ; nor did the Odist suppose that anyone had ever seen God or the Word.
The metaphorical " beholding " of God and the presence of God in the congregation is given in some of the Psalms.



62 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
For example, Ps. xvii, 15 : " I will behold thy face in right
eousness." xvi, 8 : "I have set the Lord always before me,
because he is at my right hand." lxxiii, 23 : "I am continu
ally with thee." lxxxii, 1 : " God standeth in the congre
gation of the mighty." We may also compare Wis. i, 2 :
" [The Lord] is manifested to them that do not distrust
him." In the Wisdom of Solomon knowledge of God is
imparted by Wisdom, " for she knoweth all things and hath
understanding thereof." In the Odes the manifestation is through the Word ; and since the Word is not literally seen
it would be quite irrelevant to say in a literal sense that
" he became like me," which would imply an objective appearance. We must interpret the phrase from expres sions found elsewhere. And the doctrine of the Odist being, as has been shown, that God becomes known through the entry of the Word as a portion of the divine Spirit
into the inner man, the statement " he became like me " must mean that he assimilated himself to me by entering into me.
In this Ode it is implied that to receive the Word is to
acquire knowledge of God ; and, as if to leave no doubt as
to his meaning, the writer adds : " The Father of Gnosis
is the Word of Gnosis." The sentence in verse 12— " granted
me to ask from him and to receive from his sacrifice " —is obscure. The text is in a good many places corrupt and in some the original reading is not certainly recoverable. The
idea that Christ died as a " sacrifice " is quite alien to the
thought of the Odist ; and if it were not, " receiving from " his sacrifice would be a peculiar expression. But the writer is here referring, not specially to the Word, but to the
" Father of Gnosis," " he who created wisdom," " the fulness of the ages and the Father of them," and the receiving from his sacrifice is something which it was granted to the
writer " to ask from him." The words that follow seem to
be intended as an explanation : " because he it is that is
incorrupt ... he hath given himself to be seen " ; and it
was from the incorruptibility of the Father and the emitted
Word that the writer had put on incorruption. " His sacri
fice " probably means sacrifice to him, from which he who



THEIR DOCTRINE 63
offers it will receive benefit.1 One can understand how the lively imagination of men for whom purely abstract thinking was uncongenial would transform the reception of the wisdom and the word of God by the minds of men into the idea that they had been permeated by the divine Spirit. As was pointed out previously, an analogous idea is found in the Egyptian Gnostic Hermetic literature. And there also Logos and Nous are not essentially separable from God or from one another.
The word " simplicity " in verse 4 of Ode VII probably does not mean simplicity of mental or moral character. The corresponding Greek word is haplotes, which, though it can mean simplicity in the ordinary sense, is also the contrary of complexity, signifying oneness or the absence of parts. There is support for this interpretation of the word in Tatian's Oration to the Greeks, 5, where the thought is similar to that of the Ode and may have been derived, either directly or indirectly, from it. Tatian
wrote :
With him [God] through rational process the Logos
also itself which was in him subsisted. By the will of
his haplotes springs forth the Logos; and the Logos, not
having gone into vacuity, becomes the first-born work of the
Father.
The word " simplicity " would be appropriately used in this sense in the Ode, because in the doctrine of the writer it is through the oneness of the Word with the Father that
God himself becomes known. In Tatian's Oration, as in
the Odes, the Logos is originally " in God," a part of the spiritual substance of God, from whom he issues as a spiritual emanation, separable in thought, but not essentially, and
is hence metaphorically termed the " first-born work of the Father," leading to the conception of the Word as the Son of God. The conception is much older than Christianity.
Thot, " the tongue " [= Word], comes into being in the pri
mal god, and when all created things have proceeded from Horus and Thot (Wisdom and Word), Thot unites himself
1 Op. Ps. 1, 14, 15, 22, 23, where "offer"— in w. 14 and 23—is,
in the Hebrew, sacrifice.



64 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
with Ptah.1 In the Odes of Solomon also the Word is termed
" Son of God " :
The Son of the Most High appeared in the perfection of
his Father, and light dawned from the Word that was before
time in him —sc. the Father ; the Christ is truly one.
When this passage is compared with Wis. vii, 26, 27, it becomes evident that those two verses were in the mind of the Odist while he was writing, and that his Logos is
Wisdom under another name :
She is an effulgence from everlasting light, and an un
spotted mirror of the working of God, and an image of his
goodness. And she, being one, hath power to do all things.
3. The Messiah (Christ)
Before proceeding to an examination of the significance of
the term " the Christ " as used in these Odes, the considera tion of two more examples of the writer's anti-Judaism will not be irrelevant. Harnack thought that there is a reference
to the Temple in Ode IV :
No man, O my God, changeth thy holy place, and it is not
possible that he should change it and put it into another
place . . . for thy sanctuary thou hast designed before thou
didst make places.
It does not seem possible to reconcile Harnack's opinion with the attitude of the Odist as exhibited in some verses previously quoted, to which the following may be added
from Ode XX :
I am a priest of the Lord, and to him I do priestly service ;
and to him I offer the sacrifice of his thought. . . . The
sacrifice of the Lord is righteousness and purity of heart
and lips.2
Here we see a repudiation not merely of sacrifices, but also of a priestly order, carrying with it a complete rejection of

date eighth century B.C., translated by Reitzenstein, Poim., p. 62.
2 A comparison of these verses with Ps. 1, 14, 23, seems to throw
light on the meaning of " sacrifice " in Ode VII.



THEIR DOCTRINE 65
the Temple ritual. The Odist, moreover, is not protesting against a change of place ; he says it is not possible that
anyone should change it; which, as applied to a material building, would not be true. Nor would the idea that God could need or desire a material habitation be consistent with
his metaphysical doctrine. The " sanctuary " of which he wrote may with far better reason be supposed to have been a habitation not made with hands ; in which case the change of which he denies the possibility would be the removal of
God's " holy place " from Heaven to earth, actually involv ing the denial that the Temple at Jerusalem was God's holy place. The statement that God had designed his sanctuary
before he made places—i.e., before the creation of the
world —applies better to a heavenly sanctuary than to a building. Since the conception of a heavenly temple was already given in the Psalms, there should be no doubt about the meaning of the phrases in the Ode. The relevant
passages are Ps. xi, 4, and xxxiii, 13 and 14 :
Jehovah is in his holy temple, Jehovah's throne is in
Heaven. Jehovah looketh from Heaven. . . . From the
place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants
of the earth.
Zahn understood these verses of Ode IV correctly. If
now the purpose of the Odist was to deny the sanctity of the
Temple at Jerusalem, we could infer that it was still standing when the Ode was composed. However, there is sufficient internal evidence of the early date of the composition of the Odes without relying upon that. Another, not certain but very probable, indication of the writer's anti-Judaism is found
in Ode IX : " Put on the crown in the true covenant of the Lord." Considered in the light of all the unambiguous
evidence of the writer's attitude, the expression " true
covenant " may reasonably be taken as implying that the covenant of Yahveh with Abraham, or with Israel, was not a true covenant. Now it is a sound critical principle that when we find in an ancient document an isolated statement which runs counter to the whole tenor of that document we should hold it to be an interpolation. Application of this



66 THE ODES OF SOLOMON :
principle necessarily leads to the rejection of the concluding
verse of Ode XXXI : " And that I might not make void the
promises to the fathers, to whom I promised the salvation of
their seed." The Odist cannot have written that even if the
above suggested implication of " true covenant " be not
correct. The " promises to the fathers " were promises of
salvation valid for Jews only. It is true that when Christians had taken over the Old Testament they felt obliged to
transfer by sophistical arguments the " promises " to them
selves. In Romans and Galatians it is argued that those who had the faith in God which Abraham had became heirs to the promises made to Abraham ; and the writer of the Epistle of
Barnabas asserted that a purpose of the Son of God in mani festing himself in the flesh was to prepare a new people for
himself that " he might redeem the promise made to the fathers." The Odist was not under the same necessity. His avoidance of reference to the earlier books of the Old Testament appears to be intentional; and he could not reason in the manner of the Christian writers referred to. The idea that the Word had manifested himself in the flesh in the sense in which Barnabas used the phrase is not reconcilable with his doctrine. Nor in his doctrine is salva
tion the consequence of " faith " ; it is the result of " know ledge." Another objection is the writer's evident disinclina tion to represent God as speaking in person. As a matter of fact, although the phraseology of the quoted verse requires that God should be the speaker, the immediately preceding
verses make it impossible that he can be. Hence there is a discontinuity in the sense which by itself is evidence of
interpolation. As a Jew the writer would naturally desire the salvation of his own people ; and there is in one of the
Odes evidence of this ; but it would have been impossible for him to believe that salvation could come either to the Jews or to Gentiles in consequence of the promises of Yahveh to the
patriarchs.
It is also obvious that the writer's Christ is not the Judaic Messiah; yet, knowing as we now do that he derived his phraseology from certain books of the Old Testament,
investing it wherever his theology required with a new



THEIR DOCTRINE 67
meaning, we conclude that in this case also he borrowed the title. And it is easy to see why he did so. We have had evidence in a quoted passage from the Psalms of Solomon
that just before the beginning of the Christian era the best Jewish thought was connecting the Messiah not nearly so much with an expected political supremacy of the Jews as with the establishment of the Kingdom of God upon earth, the inauguration of the reign of righteousness. The messianic king as the representative of Yahveh would con quer the minds of men by the power of righteousness and truth ; so that men of every race would seek out the Jews and every Jew would find ten Gentiles eager to say to him :
" We will go with you ; for we have heard that God is with you." 1 Hellenistic Jews, who had broken down the barriers of race, could with greater confidence hope for the establish ment of a universal Kingdom of God in which righteousness would be the rule and monotheism the only creed. They carried over from their national preconceptions the notion of the founding of the new Kingdom by a Messiah, a Christ, but their Christ was no longer a messianic son of David ; he was the Word of God, personified in thought, but in actual belief
a spiritual emanation from the Most High, the " Spirit of the
Lord." And, since as a Spirit he would be neither seen nor heard, he could act upon the world in general only through
" the elect " who had received him, in whom he had become incarnate ; and it was for them to make him known. This
view is quite clearly expressed in Ode VII : " The Most High shall be known in his saints." And these words are not to be understood in the sense in which they might be used by a
modern rationalizing thinker. A more detailed expression
of the belief is found in Ode X :
The Lord hath directed my mouth by his Word, and gave
me that I might speak the fruit of his peace, to convert
the souls of those who are willing to come to him. I was
strengthened and made mighty. . . . And the Gentiles were
gathered together who were scattered abroad. And I was
unpolluted by my love for them . . . and they walked in
my life and were saved and became my people for ever and
ever. 1 Zech. viii, 23.



68 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
Although the closing sentences are in the past tense they
are of course prophetic. They foretell the conversion of the Gentiles through the agency, not solely of the writer himself in person, for he writes as the representative of his community
which has replaced the Jewish nation as his " people." And the conversion is to be brought about by the Word which inspires the saints and operates through them. He pointedly
demonstrates his universalism not only by the words " my people," but also in the statement that, although a Jew, he is unpolluted by his love for Gentiles. The statement is further evidence of early date. Even in the oldest Christian Epistles fellowship with Gentiles is so much a matter of course that no apology for it is thought necessary. No doubt there were already Gentile converts in the community
O. Most of the Odes were written to be sung by the
congregation, so that any member of it may be imagined to be the speaker, or even the congregation as a whole. And
the statement that " the Lord hath directed my mouth by
his Word " explains an occasional ambiguity as to whether it is the Word or the writer who is supposed to be speaking.
The Word, not having literally a mouth, speaks by the mouth of the congregation. The idea is given in
Ecclus. xxiv, 2 : "In the congregation of the Most
High shall she [Wisdom] open her mouth " ; which of course
means that the words of Wisdom are in reality uttered by
members of the congregation. The theme of Ode X—viz., that the congregation, inspired by the Word, is the agent for
the establishment of the Kingdom of God —recurs in Ode
XXIX :
[The Lord] showed me his sign; and he led me by his
light, and gave me the rod of his power ; that I might subdue
the imagination of the peoples, and the power of men of
might to bring them low; and to make war by his Word,
and to take victory by his power. And the Lord overthrew
my enemy by his Word.
One can understand from the experience of Paul at Ephesus that a community which attacked Pagan idolatry would be
likely to make enemies, some of whom would be " men of might." Note how the writer has taken his imagery from the



THEIR DOCTRINE 69
Jewish conception of the Messiah and applied it symbolically
to the Word. In the Wisdom literature the words " error "
and " folly " are consistently used to signify unrighteousness, and as the antitheses of the wisdom which is knowledge of
God. In Ode XXXI they are used in this sense, but probably with a special reference to false worship, which is to
be abolished through the coming of the Word. In this Ode
the term " the Lord " seems to be applied directly to the
Word; but the " appearance " of the Word is in reality
God's revelation of himself, so that practically it is the Lord
Most High before whom the abysses are dissolved. " The
truth of the Lord " certainly means the truth of God. The
" abysses " and the " darkness " are obviously synonyms of
error and folly :
The abysses were dissolved before the Lord and darkness
was destroyed by his appearance; error went astray and
perished at his hand, and folly found no path to walk in
and was submerged by the truth of the Lord [He opened his
mouth and spoke grace and joy ; and he spoke a new song
of praise to his name. He lifted up his voice to the Most
High, and offered to him the sons that were in his hands.]
The subject of the concluding sentences is ostensibly the Word. But there is something rather strange about these
and the immediately following verses —so much so, indeed,
that interpolation may be suspected, based upon Jn. xvii, with special reference to verses 11-15. The Word is here individualized to a degree which is found nowhere else in the
Odes, and the sentence is ungrammatical. If, as I think is
really the case, the meaning of the writer is that it was before
God that the abysses were dissolved, and " the truth of the
Lord " is God's truth, then the pronoun " He " with which
the next sentence begins ought to stand for God ; but it does
not. On the other hand, if we take " the Lord " to mean the
Word and the pronoun " He " to refer to him, " his name " must mean God's name; but, by the hypothesis, God had not been previously mentioned. The two following verses, 6 and 7, may be part of the interpolation, for the transition from
7 to 8 is exceedingly harsh :
6. Come forth, ye that have been afflicted and receive joy ;



70 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
7. And possess your souls by grace; and take to you
immortal life.
8. And they condemned me when I rose up.
Who are the " they " ? If, however, we read verse 8
immediately after the words " truth of the Lord," the
pronoun can be understood from " error " and " folly," which are poetical synonyms for wicked and unbelieving
people. It cannot be doubted that there is a connection
between these verses and the passage of John, and the
peculiarities observable in the former make it probable that
it is they which are secondary. Moreover, it is scarcely possible that the Odes were written later than the Fourth Gospel. The initial verses may be regarded as in some measure prophetic. The dissolution off the abysses and the destruc tion of darkness are to be brought about through the agency of the saints inspired by the Word. The abysses and error
are met with again in Ode XIV, where, in very figurative language, the abolition of error and the closing of the abysses through the voice of the community speaking under the inspiration of the Word are vividly foretold. The annihila
tion of polytheism appears to be the dominant theme :-
The dove fluttered over the Christ, because he was her head, and she sang over him and her voice was heard.
And the inhabitants were afraid and the sojourners were
moved. The birds dropped their wings and all creeping
things died in their holes; and the abysses opened them
selves and were hidden [or, were opened and closed]. And
they were asking for the Lord like women in travail; and
he was not given them for food, because he did not belong
to them. The abysses were sealed up with the seal of the
Lord ; and they perished in thought, those who had existed
from ancient times ; for they were corrupt from the begin
ning, and the end of their corruption was the Life. . . . For
they who in their hearts were lifted up were deficient in
wisdom ; and so they were rejected because the truth was
not with them. For the Lord disclosed his way, and spread
abroad his grace; and those who understood it know his holiness.
In this Ode " the Lord " is God. The " way of the Lord " is
mentioned several times in the Psalms ; " his grace " and



THEIR DOCTRINE 71
" his holiness " are the grace and holiness of God ; and the
" seal of the Lord " is his seal. It is to be remembered that the text of these Odes is in a good many passages corrupt, and that may sometimes be the cause of ambiguity. But even where the text is sound the highly figurative style occasionally makes comprehension difficult. The obscurities which have baffled commentators are, however, in some cases of their own making, because they have not begun by placing
themselves at the right point of view. It is perfectly certain that the opening sentence of this Ode does not involve a reminiscence of the Gospel account of the baptism of Jesus.
In the Gospel the dove is the Holy Spirit, and there is no
reasonable sense in saying that Christ is " the head " of the Holy Spirit. Nor, at the baptism of Jesus, did the dove
" sing " over him. But the Lord, whether as God or the Word, is the spiritual head of the community, and of what else could he be the head ? Moreover, since the community sings praises to the Lord, it could figuratively be said to sing
" over him." It may be thought that to figure the com munity as a dove is a flight of fancy too bold even for the
writer of these Odes. To think so would be to err. In
Ps. lxxiv, 19, we read : " O deliver not the soul of thy turtle dove unto the multitude of the wicked; forget not the congregation of thy poor." The Psalm was written in a time
of national distress, hence the qualification of " thy poor."
That " the congregation " is Israel appears clearly from
verse 2 : " Remember thy congregation which thou hast purchased of old." Now, seeing that the Odist had a perfect knowledge of the Psalms and that he has substituted his own congregation of the saints for the congregation of Israel, the figure in question was not an unnatural or an unlikely one for
him to use. In 2 Esdras v, 26, again, Israel is designated
under the figure of a dove : " Of all the fowls that are created thou hast named thee one dove." And, when the congrega tion had been pictured as a dove, fluttering would not be inappropriate. Doves do not sing, but congregations do. This example shows how necessary it is to take account of the exuberance of the writer's fancy. The sealing up of the abyss is very possibly correctly



72 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
understood as foretelling the termination of the power of the
evil spirits of the underworld. It is also extremely probable
that " those who had existed from ancient times " and " were
corrupt from the beginning " are the pagan deities whose
corruption would be ended with " the Life." And " the
Life " is God. In the Mandaean hymns the word is similarly
used —e.g., " The Life is glorified and victorious." The victory of the Life or the end of corruption is evidently to
come about in the future through the disclosure of the " way of the Lord," and the agent of the disclosure is the congrega tion which has been inspired by the Word ; hence the state
ment that the voice of the dove was heard. The picture of the ultimate despair of those who should not have under stood the way of the Lord and his grace, who would be rejected because they were deficient in wisdom, is evidently founded upon the description of the despair of the wicked in
Wis. of Sol., chap, v :
When the wicked shall see [the salvation of the righteous
and their own imminent ruin] they shall be troubled with
terrible fear and shall be amazed at the marvel of salvation
and for distress of spirit shall they groan and shall say :
Verily we went astray from the way of truth and the way
of the Lord we knew not.
The thought that the knowledge of God would be given to the world by the saints is also to be found in Wis.
xviii, 4 :
Thy sons, through whom the incorruptible light of the
Law was to be given to the race of men.
The Odist has substituted Gnosis for Law. But the writer of the second half of Wisdom was, it would seem, less of a
Hellenist than the writer of the first half. In Ode XXIII we have a similar theme, presented in different imagery.
The Ode opens with a song of exultation :
Joy is of the saints ! and who shall put it on but they
alone ? Grace is of the elect ! and who shall receive it
except those who trust in it from the beginning ? Love is
of the elect ! and who shall put it on except those who
have possessed it from the beginning ?



THEIR DOCTRINE 73
This prelude would have no relation to the body of the Ode, and would therefore be pointless, unless the elect who
had received and " put on " Grace and Love had been regarded as the effective agents in the establishment of God's Kingdom. The Word operates through them. The
Odist continues :
And the Thought [of the Most High] was like a letter.
His Will descended from on high . . . and many hands
rushed to the letter to seize it and to take and read it;
and it escaped their fingers and they were affrighted at it
and at the seal that was upon it. Because it was not per
mitted to them to loose its seal ; for the power that was
over the seals was greater than they. ... A wheel received
it and it was coming upon it, and a sign was with it of
Dominion and Government; and everything that shook
the wheel it was mowing and cutting down ; and the multi
tude of opposing forces it overwhelmed. . . . The letter
was one of command, for there was included in it all districts ;
and there was seen at its head the head which was revealed,
the Son of Truth from the Most High Father; and he
inherited and took possession of everything; and all the
apostates hasted and fled away. And those who persecuted
and were enraged became extinct.
The unsubstantiality of the elements of the writer's theosophy is clearly perceptible. He will not say literally
that God speaks to men ; and so he says that God sends his Word to them. He then imagines that the Word has
objective reality. In this Ode, since a message of supreme importance had to be brought, the Word comes upon a letter as the written, instead of the spoken, word of God.
But we are so far away from physical realities that the letter
is the " Thought " and the " Will " of God. The seal upon the letter is, of course, the seal of God. And the letter, being addressed to the community of saints, cannot be seized by any one else. As the letter and the seal are poetical images
so also is the " Son of Truth " a poetical metaphor for the
Word which had issued from " the Truth who is self-origi
nate." Since the " taking possession of everything " was certainly in the future, this Ode, like the one previously
considered, must be prophetic —an expression of the writer's
confident anticipation. The figure of the wheel, as was shown
f—g .o.



74 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
previously, was taken from Isaiah. As it is the wheel
which receives the letter it must represent the congregation of the elect, to whom the Dominion and the Government are assigned. The congregation is thus the visible vice gerent of the invisible Word. The reader is prepared for this interpretation by the terms of the prelude in which
it is said that it is the elect who receive " Grace " ; for
Grace is a synonym of the " Son of Truth." The cutting down and overwhelming of opposing forces by the wheel is a metaphorical paraphrase of the later statement that those who persecuted and were enraged became extinct.
It is probable that in this and in some others of the Odes the writer had particularly in view orthodox Jews as per secutors, though doubtless there were other opponents. The revelation of the Word to the congregation was the divine authorization of their inheritance of the earth as the depositories of the truth. We may observe how the writer, although his Son of Truth is not the Jewish Messiah,
has adopted the messianic phraseology — " Dominion and
Government," " he inherited and took possession of every
thing." But the Dominion is a spiritual Dominion, and the Messiah is the Spirit of the Lord. The metaphysical charac ter of the writer's conception of the Word is again clearly
perceived in Ode XII, in which no distinction is made between the uttered word of God and the Word as a spiritual
substance :
The descent of the Word and his way are incomprehen
sible. ... He is the light and dawn of thought. . . . By
him the worlds spoke to one another. For the mouth of the
Most High spoke to them.
Such words were never written of a known person. The use of the past tense in relation to a future event is common in Hebrew and its kindred languages. The writer for the sake of vividness projects himself imaginatively
into the future. An example may be given from Ps. of
Sol, XI :
Stand up on high, Jerusalem, and behold thy children
who are being gathered from the east and the west by the
Lord; and from the north they come to the joy of their



THEIR DOCTRINE 75
God; and from the far distant islands God gathered them.
Lofty mountains has he humbled and made plain before
them ; and the hills fled away before their entrance.
The Odist emphasizes his opposition to this view in his
statement in Ode X that it was the Gentiles who were gathered together. There is another sense in which the
term " his Christ " with the meaning " his anointed " is
used in these Odes. It can be understood from the canonical Psalms whence the writer has borrowed so much of his
phraseology. The term is found in Ps. xx, 6 :
Now know I that Jehovah saveth his anointed; he will
hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of
his right hand. Some trust in chariots and some in horses,
but we will remember the name of Jehovah our God.
In these verses " his anointed " is the personified Israel ;
hence the singular pronoun " him." The " we " in the fol
lowing verse proves that it is not one person but the nation which trusts in Jehovah and is saved. The correctness of this interpretation emerges even more clearly from Ps.
ii,
2
and
:3

The Kings of the earth set themselves against Jehovah
and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands
asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
In two other Psalms Israel
is
termed God's anointed
;
one of these
is
Ps. lxxxiv,
:9

Behold,
O
God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.
It would perhaps be possible to suppose that the Psalm
was written as a Psalm of David, who
is
imagined in this verse to be referring to himself; but the character of the Psalm as a whole does not favour this supposition. And
it
is
quite excluded in the case of Ps. xv, 15, where the Psalmist
is
writing of the Israelites before their entry into Canaan, and says
:

He suffered no man to do them wrong
;
yea, he reproved kings for their sakes
;
saying
:
Touch not mine anointed.
Now in the Odes
of
Solomon the chosen people, the elect,



76 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
are no longer Israel but the congregation of saints; con
sequently, Israel in the Psalms being " his anointed," in the
Odes the congregation naturally becomes " his anointed."
The conclusion thus reached is confirmed by the fact that it
clears up a phrase in Ode IX which has occasioned some
perplexity :
Give me your souls that I may also give you my soul, the
Word of the Lord and his good pleasure, the holy thought
which he has devised concerning his anointed. For in the
will of the Lord is your life, and his thought is everlasting
life; and your perfection is incorruptible. Be enriched in
God the Father, and receive the thought of the Most High.
Be strong and be redeemed by his grace. For I announce to
you peace, to you his saints.
This Ode is evidently an address by the writer to his congregation, of which he may therefore be supposed to be
the head—this is an important inference. He begins by announcing that he will declare the good pleasure and the
holy thought of God concerning " his anointed." He then proceeds to make known the pleasure and the thought of
God concerning the community, " his saints." It is to them that peace is announced, and it is they who are to receive
the thought of the Most High. Hence " his anointed " [= his Christ] is in this Ode the community. And jthe
" thought " which is received is really equivalent to the Word
as the expression of God's thought. For the Word is also
" my soul," which is to be given by the speaker to his fellow
members if they will give him their souls. The idea being,
we may suppose, that the Word—the holy Thought, or the
Will —of the Most High is to be transmitted from the soul of the speaker into the souls of those addressed, who, per haps, were new members, since later on they are exhorted
to " put on the crown " which is said to be " Truth." Com parable with this allocution is a Marcosian formula quoted
by Irenaeus (I. xiii, 3) : "I wish to give you a share of my
grace. . . . But the place of the greatness is within you. Receive first grace from me and through me . . . that thou
mayest be what I am and I what thou art." The address
may have been composed for a ceremony of initiation, one item of which may have been a symbolic crowning. There



THEIR DOCTRINE 77
is some reason to think that another feature of it may have been an anointing with oil. Moreover, since receiving the
Thought of the Most High is being " enriched in God the Father," we see again that to receive the Word is to receive
God. And to do this is to be " redeemed " and to have
" everlasting life." The foregoing quotations make clear the transformation of the messianic hope which has come to pass in the minds
of the Odist and his congregation. Instead of the Judaic conception of a material victory or of a cataclysmic estab lishment of the Kingdom of God we have the notion that a new world order is to take root in the community of the elect and to grow with the expansion of that. As in the earlier belief, it is still the Messiah, the Christ, who comes
to found the Kingdom of God, but he is already here —the
Word —invisibly incarnate in the elect. And there is also a visible Christ, God's anointed, the community itself, which under one aspect is God's agent for the establishment of the universal reign of righteousness, and under another aspect the Kingdom itself in embryo. The renewal of a corrupt world through the divine life inherent in the com
munity is metaphorically foretold in Ode XXII, to be quoted
later. In that Ode the Kingdom of God is definitely equated with the congregation of the saints.
4. The Son of God
One would naturally suppose that Jews at the commence ment of the Christian era could not readily imagine that God had a son except in the figurative sense in which the chosen people might be regarded as the children of God. Orthodox Jews would surely have repudiated the idea that Yahveh could have a son in any other sense. Judging from the contemptuous manner in which the Pharisees and the Rabbis spoke of the peasantry of Palestine we can infer that
most of these were not strictly orthodox Jews, and it was apparently among this class of people that apocalyptic ideas found a congenial soil. But it does not seem likely
that it would have occurred even to them to imagine that any man, however powerful the impression he might have



78 THE ODES OF SOLOMON :
made upon their minds, was the only-begotten Son of God.
There is in fact evidence that in the more Judaic section of the early Christian Church Jesus was not believed to have been the Son of God in that special sense. He is not so named in the Epistle of James; and according to Acts
(iv, 27) Peter preached Jesus as the " holy Servant " of God.
One passage which professes to report the words of Peter
excludes by implication the unique Sonship of Jesus :
The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom ye slew. . . .
Him did God exalt to be a Prince and a Saviour. (Acts v, 30.)
The connection of " Son of God " with " Logos " indicates that the term originated among Hellehized Jews of the Dispersion. Throughout the Pauline and Johannine litera
ture it is found ; and it is probably not without significance that the first appearance of it in Acts is in ix, 20, where it is
said that Paul " proclaimed Jesus that he is Son of God." The Pauline Epistles have been catholicized and so has the Fourth Gospel; but even so the Pauline and Johannine
writings are classed by biblical scholars as " Hellenistic." There seems then to have been a confluence of two streams : a duplex Judaic stream in which Jesus was preached either
as the messianic " Son of David " or as the " Servant of
God " (pais Theou), and a Hellenistic stream in which he was
preached as the " Son of God." And it was long before the two streams completely coalesced. Coalescence had not occurred when the Epistle of Barnabas was written, for the
writer of that Epistle denies that Jesus was " Son of David."
In the First Epistle of Clement also Jesus is " Son of God "
but not of David, and he is said to have been " sent forth
from God " with no mention of Mary. Catholic Christianity
may be said to have begun with Ignatius. In the Ignatian
Epistles Jesus is both " Son of David " and " Son of God." But there were still Hellenistic Christians a good while after the time of Ignatius. Now the Pauline and the Johannine doctrines, though each of them may be classed as Hellenistic, have some very dis tinctive features which mark them off the one from the other.



THEIR DOCTRINE 79
Hence, just as we know that the specific differences between a chimpanzee and a gorilla can be explained only by postu lating an evolutionary period between these species and a common ancestor, so also we must postulate a period of development between the Pauline and Johannine doctrines and a more primitive form of Christianity in which the com
mon factor, the belief that Jesus—or at any rate the Christ
was Son of God, was already present. It is not necessary to suppose that either of those doctrines was directly derived from the Odes of Solomon ; but, to continue the evolutionary
parallel, we may liken the discovery of the Odes to the discovery of an extinct species which furnishes information with respect to an earlier stage in a certain line of physio
logical development. In the Odes the Christ is Son of God, but the name Jesus has not yet been introduced. The Jewish writer of the Odes of Solomon was not more
likely than less Hellenized Jews to have come spontaneously to the belief that the Christ was the Son of God in any sense analogous to that in which a man is the son of his father. Later Christianity appears to have been influenced by the Greek Mystery religions and thus to have reached a more
definite —eventually, one might perhaps even say, a some
what more literal— conception of the relationship between the Son and the Father. During the second century a continuous process of literalization is perceptible of which there is no trace in the Odes of Solomon ; and moving, as the
writer did, in a world of metaphor, it would be easy for him to regard the effluence of the Word from the Most High as a kind of birth, without any infringement of his monotheism.
It is probable, indeed, that the idea was not a spontaneous product of his own mind. There is evidence that HellenoEgyptian theosophy was beginning to influence Jewish religious speculation as early as the last pre-Christian cen
tury. In some of the Hermetic writings Logos is the son of Nous, and the relationship is just of that metaphysical character which would harmonize with the religious ideas of the Odist. But his knowledge of literature of that kind could merely render more definite the suggestion which he must have found in his own particular field. For the



80 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
relationship is indicated in the Wisdom of Solomon. The
writer of that book, after having in the previous chapter
described Wisdom as an " effluence of the glory of the Al
mighty," says in viii, 3 : " She glorifieth her noble birth in
that it is given her to dwell with God." The effluent Wisdom thus being regarded as the daughter of God, in the Odes the effluent Word would quite naturally become in the same metaphorical sense the Son of God. The Odist was not the first writer in his own line of thought
to use the term " Son of God " ; it is found in the Psalms and in the Wisdom of Solomon, but with a different meaning
from that which we have just been considering. In the former (Ps.
ii,
7-12) the Son
is
Israel
:

Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou art my son
;
this day have
I
begotten thee. Ask of me, and
I
shall give thee the
heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of
the earth for thy possession. ... Be wise now therefore,
O
ye kings.
.
. . Kiss the son lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way. . .
.
Blessed are they that put their
trust in him.
The final clauses certainly tend to create the impression that the son
is
a single person and even a divine person. And the promise of inheritance and possession suggests the Messiah. The text has, of course, been so interpreted. There
is
no evidence that the Odist interpreted
it
in that
sense and
it
is
very unlikely that he did. The interpretation
is
obviously incorrect, for the exhortation to the kings to
" kiss the son " implies that he
is
continuously present.
It
is
to Israel that the inheritance
is
promised. Israel
is
termed Son of God also by Hosea (xi,
1)
:
" When Israel was a child, then
I
loved him, and called my son out of Egypt." Now, since the Odist has frequently transferred to his congregation expressions which in the Old Testament were applied to Israel,
it
is
quite likely that he also transferred this. Hence
it
would be
a
mistake, whenever we meet with the term Son of God in an Ode, to assume as a matter of course that a divine Son of God
is
denoted. Above all,
if
we find that to apply
it
to the community makes better



THEIR DOCTRINE 81
sense and is more appropriate to the context, we should do
so. A case of this kind occurs in Ode VII :
Knowledge he hath appointed as his way . . . and brought
it to all perfection, and set over it the footprints of his light ;
and I walked therein from the beginning to the end. For by
him it was made, and it rested in the Son. He was pleased
with the Son, and for his salvation he will take hold of
everything ; and the Most High shall be known in his saints.
Ignorance hath been destroyed, because knowledge of the
Lord hath arrived.
In this case to take " the Son " to mean the Word creates a
difficulty, whereas if we understand the term as designating the community, the meaning is clear and conformable to the known doctrine of the writer. Gnosis was undoubtedly brought by the Word; but it rested in the congregation.
That must surely be the significance of the statement, " the Most High shall be known in his saints." Otherwise the
sudden mention of " the saints " would be irrelevant and unprepared for. The meaning is that the knowledge of the Most High, brought by the Word, resides in the congregation
of the saints, who are thus able to make him known. " Ig norance hath been destroyed, because knowledge of the Lord
hath arrived." And it was of course into the congregation that it had arrived ; and there it "rested." Again, as applied to the Word, the divine Christ, no reasonable sense can be
attached to the words " for his salvation he will take hold
of everything." Even if we were to suppose —which is
certainly not the case—that the writer had in view the cruci fixion of the Christ, he could not have thought it necessary
for his salvation that God should " take hold of everything." According to Christian dogma God raised Christ from the dead by his mere irresistible will. He did not need to take hold of everything. The future tense also is inconsistent with the supposition that the writer was referring to an event
which was past. If, on the other hand, we suppose the Son in this Ode to be the community, all difficulty disappears.
The statement that God " was pleased with the Son " is completely out of accord with the metaphysical doctrine of
the Odist, if " the Son " means " the Word." Nothing of



82 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
the kind is found anywhere else at all. On the other hand, the statement that God was pleased with his elect would be quite appropriate.
At the beginning of the Christian era we find among broadminded Jews the belief that God's purpose in choosing their race was that they should make him known to the Gentiles. The writer of the Testament of Levi (c. 14) says to the Jews :
" Ye are the lights of heaven, like the sun and the moon ;
what will the Gentiles do if ye darken yourselves with
ungodliness ? " Philo, again, says : " The Jewish race re
ceived as its portion the priesthood of all mankind." 1 It
would follow from that conception that the Jews must necessarily be preserved. God sent affliction upon them to purify them for their great work, but he would not allow them to be destroyed. The Odist, believing that, not Israel but his own community had been made by God the deposi
tory of " knowledge " for the benefit of mankind, would of course also believe that God would use all means for its preservation. And he found in Wisdom a passage which he
could apply :
The righteous live for ever . . . because with his right
hand shall [the Lord] cover them . . . and shall make the
whole creation his weapon to repel their enemies (v, 15-17).
By the expression " rested in " we are directed to Ecclus.
xxiv, 8 :
He that created me [Wisdom] made my tabernacle to
rest, and said, Let thy tabernacle be in Jacob and thine
inheritance in Israel.
The Odist has paraphrased the statement that God made Wisdom to rest in Israel into the statement that he made
Gnosis " to rest " in the congregation of the elect, naming it
" the Son." The immediately preceding words " for by him
it was made [created] " render it more than probable that the
writer had this verse of Ecclesiasticus in mind. Thus in the doctrine of the Odist there is an invisible spiritual Christ the Son and a material one, the latter being the community; and the two are united as spirit and body are united. The
1 De Abr. II, 15.



THEIR DOCTRINE 83
realization of this fact helps to a better understanding of
Ode III, which is evidently a Psalm of initiation. It has both a literal and a symbolic significance. The neophyte
sings, " His members are with him and on them do I hang."
In the congregation which he has joined he " hangs " upon the members of the Christ ; and there finds upon earth the
" rest " which corresponds with God's rest. As he sings the
words " I shall be no stranger there " he is made to realize the brotherly welcome with which he is received. And in joining the community he becomes united with the Son both in the literal and in the spiritual sense of the term.
In later Catholic Christian belief the union of the Christ with the congregation was less intimately conceived. The congregation received the Holy Spirit, but the Christ was
thought of not as being " within " the members, but as
standing " in the midst " of them. The primitive conception was too metaphysical to subsist when Christianity had become popularized. The metaphysical conception was
certainly the earlier since it was directly derived from the
Wisdom of Solomon. In Ode XIX the Son is the Word :
A cup of milk was offered to me ; and I drank it in the
sweetness of the delight of the Lord. The Son is the cup
and he who was milked is the Father ; and the Holy Spirit
milked him . . . and the Holy Spirit opened his bosom and
mingled the milk from the two breasts of the Father, and gave
the mixture to the world without its knowing it ; and they
who receive it are in the perfection of the right hand [of God].
The concluding sentence makes it plain that the milk here, as in some other Odes, is Gnosis; for the writer's doctrine is that redemption comes through, and only through, the
knowledge of God. In Ode XXX we read that the living
water, which is Gnosis, came " invisibly, and until it was
given in the midst they did not know it." The means of
transmission was the Word. " It flows forth from the lips of
the Lord " and " the mouth of the Lord is the true Word and the door of his light." Accordingly the Word is likened to a
cup. Iri some of the Odes the Holy Spirit is masculine ; in
others it is feminine. A difference of authorship might be



84 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
inferred. But it is evidence of the antiquity of these Odes that the Holy Spirit is extremely ill-defined. The Father and the Word are both Spirit and both holy ; and usually it is impossible to detach the Holy Spirit from them as a separate
entity. For example, where it is written in VI, 7 that " Our
spirits praise his holy Spirit," we must understand that it is
the spiritual God himself who is praised. Again, in XI, in the
verse " tell forth praises to his Spirit and love his holiness," just as loving the holiness of God is a paraphrastic expression for loving the holy God, so also praising his Spirit is the same thing as praising himself. Hence it will not do to literalize a poetical expression, involving certainly to modern taste a strange metaphor,1 and think of the Father and the Holy Spirit as two persons standing apart from one another. The meaning is that the Father, who cannot have direct contact with men, gave them the milk of Gnosis through the media tion of his Spirit, and that it was carried into their souls in
the cup which is the Word — the Word itself, however, being an extension of the same Spirit. Where the Holy Spirit is represented as feminine the Odist is writing under the influence of the Wisdom literature, in which Sophia, the
divine Wisdom, is a Spirit effluent from God. In the
continuation of the Ode there is mention of " a son," who is
not necessarily the Son :
The womb of the Virgin was enfeebled [ ?] and she con
ceived and bore and became a mother with many mercies.
She became pregnant and brought forth a son without
incurring pain. And because it happened not without
purpose and she had not sought a midwife — because he
[God] delivered her— she brought forth of her own will, as
it were a man. And she brought him forth ostensibly, and
acquired him in great power, and loved him in salvation,
and guarded him in kindness, and made him manifest in greatness.
The apparent lack of continuity between these verses and those which immediately precede them suggests that they
were added by another hand. If the writer intended by the Virgin the Virgin Mary, then without doubt they have been
1 The metaphor may have been suggested by Job xxi, 24 : " His
breasts are full of milk."



THEIR DOCTRINE 85
interpolated. For in that case the two sections do not fit at
all. The Virgin, in these Odes — as appears from Ode
XXXIII—is Wisdom ; and the Holy Spirit mentioned just
before, being feminine, is also Wisdom ; so that, if the Virgin of the second section were Mary, the sole thread of connection between the two sections would be snapped, and we should have to decide that the second section was not written by the Odist. The text is evidently corrupt and the correct transla
tion of some words is uncertain. In particular the word
" enfeebled " in the opening phrase is very dubious. Emendations have been proposed by commentators.
Harris's emendation " the womb of the Virgin took it "
sc. the milk —has the merit of establishing continuity between the two sections, but makes it impossible that the son born to the Virgin can be the Christ. For before the .Virgin received the milk, the Son, as we are told, had been the cup which contained it. How could the Son have transmitted the milk to the Virgin before he was born ? Moreover the milk is Gnosis, which was brought to mankind by the Son ; it was not the seed from which the Son had his birth.1 Since these Odes were more valued by Gnostics than by Catholics it is possible that the section was added by a Gnostic ; in which case the Virgin would be Sophia, and thus a link would be created with the preceding section, since we
know that Gnostics —e.g., Bardesanes—who were apparently acquainted with the Odes, identified the Holy Spirit with Sophia as the mother of the Saviour.2 Inconsistency in the
representation would be explicable if the second section had a different author from the first. But one of two conclusions must be true : either the second section is a later insertion, or the son born to the Virgin was not the Christ. The self-contradiction pointed out above is not the only reason for concluding that the Odist cannot have written the
section if the birth of the Christ is the subject of it. Through
1 It seems fairly certain that drinking a cup of milk was an item
in one of the rites of this community. In a Berlin papyrus is found
the prescription : " Taking the milk with the honey, drink it up
before the rising of the sun and something divine shall enter into
thy heart."
2 Hippolytus, Rej. Omn. Haer., vi, 35.



86 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
out these Odes the Word is a direct emanation from God. The idea that Wisdom was his mother would be an in consistent idea. Inconsistent also with the writer's con
ception of the Word are the bringing forth " ostensibly
with demonstration " or " openly," as some have translated
it—the " guarding " and " the manifesting." The Word is
invisible Spirit, he is " Thought " and " Will." His descent
and his way are " incomprehensible." His " swiftness " is inexpressible. He becomes known intuitively, not by
physical vision. In Ode XLI it is said that " he was known
before the foundation of the world "—evidently, therefore, not known to men at that time, whereas the bringing forth
openly and the making him " manifest " would surely imply
that. It is to be remembered that if Wisdom, the Holy Spirit, was his mother, this birth was not his introduction into the world but his original birth. Moreover in the being
known —i.e., really, having his existence —before the founda tion of the world, birth and infancy and the need for being
" guarded " seem to be excluded by implication. A material
being is indicated by the terms of the concluding sentence of
the quotation; but to explain this birth—assuming the
section to be original —from the Gospel account of the birth of Jesus, whose name never occurs and of whose recorded deeds and words the Odist betrays not the very slightest knowledge, would be quite arbitrary and contrary to the whole spirit of the Odes, in which the Christ is never localized, except in the souls of the elect.
If the verses are genuine—and they may be—it is possible
that they were misunderstood by Gnostics of the second century as a description of the birth of the Logos from Sophia.
But, since that cannot be, the explanation must be sought in
another direction ; and we may obtain some light from Philo, whose doctrine was probably not altogether peculiar to him self. There is evidence, to be referred to later, that specula tions similar to his were current among other Hellenistic Jews of his time ; and in several respects there is an affinity
between his thought and that of the Odist. Now Philo terms
Sophia an immaculate perfect virgin [cp. Ode XXXIII] and
says that she, having received the seed of God in some



THEIR DOCTRINE "87
incomprehensible metaphysical sense, conceived and bore the lonly and beloved visible son, this cosmos.1 With even better reason could the Odist have regarded spiritual man as the beloved son of the perfect Virgin. Some Gnostics did in fact hold that Gnosis was the seed of God from which was begotten
the pneumatic man.2 The metaphor of the Odist can be so interpreted. The womb of the Virgin, having taken the milk
of God—Gnosis—conceived and produced the pneumatic people. The idea was actually suggested by Wis. of Sol.
(ix, 1 and 2), where it is written that God created all things by his Word and formed man by his Wisdom. From \ this statement when Wisdom was pictured as a virgin, the transition to the description in the Ode was easy. We can also trace to Wisdom some of the expressions used—cg,
“ Wisdom is a spirit which loveth man ”; “ ‘she is unto men
a treasure that faileth not ” ; “ she makes them friends of
God ”; “ Because of her I shall have glory among multi
tudes ” ; “ She shall guard me in her glory ”; “ Through Wisdom were men saved.” The explanation here given is proved almost conclusively to be correct by evidence found
in Ode XXXVI :
I rested on the Spirit of the Lord; and she raised me on
high, and made me stand on my feet in the height of the
Lord, before his perfection and glory. . . . She brought
me forth before the face of the Lord; and although a son
of man I was named the illuminated one, the son of God.
. . . For according to the goodness of the Most High she
made me; and according to his own newness he renewed
me; and he anointed me from his own perfectibn.
We see in the above-quoted extract the connecting link
between Wis. ix, 2, and Ode XIX; for here we have given as equivalent the two statements that Wisdom (the Spirit of
the Lord) “ made me ” and that she “ brought me forth.”
Traces of this original view are found in the later Gnosticism.
In the Acts of Thomas, in an invocation at the end of chapter
mix, Sophia is addressed as “ the Mother of all creatures.”
~ 1 According to Philo, God had two sons, an elder, the invisible
Logos, and a younger, the visible cosmos. In the Hermetic writings
the cosmos is the visible image of the invisible Logos.
' Op. 1 Jn. iii, 9.



88 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
There were some Gnostics who named Sophia Barbeb. According to these, Barbelo was the mother of living beings.1
The origin of the belief is very ancient} In a cuneiform
inscription Ishtar, with whom Sophia was identified, is
addressed as “ the compassionate mother of mankind.” The prevalent Gnostic opinion was that men derived their soul from Sophia; but while some traced the pneuma also to her, others believed that people become pneumatic through the Logos. The doctrine of the Odes appears to vacillate
between the 'two opinions. It seems necessary to suppose that during the period of their composition the substitution of Word for Wisdom was gradually taking place. The
statement in Ode XXXVI that “ she brought me forth before
the face of the Lord,” may be compared with the statement
in Ode XIX that “ she needed no midwife because God delivered her.”
I can hardly imagine that many readers will have supposed
that the verses quoted from\ Ode XXXVI are intended to
record an utterance of the Christ. It seems fairly obvious that the writer was speaking for himself and for the members
of his congregation. The \birth referred to in the one Ode must surely be that referred to in the other; some critics,
therefore, who take the second part of Ode XIX to be a _ description of the virgin birth of Christ maintain that the
Christ is the speaker in Ode XXXVI, in spite of the lack of appropriateness in most of the expressions. The only apparent reason for this opinion, apart from the pre-supposi
tion with regard to Ode XIX, lies in the verse “ I was named
the illuminated one, the son of God.” Butthis statement
need not cause any difliculty at all. In Ode XLI the saints
are termed “ the Lord’s children ” ;- and in Ode III we read 1
“ Because I love him who is the Soul shall become a son.”
Through the ceremony of initiation each member of the
community became a “ son of God,” like the righteous man of Wis.
ii,
16. Such apparently was also the case in the
Pauline communities; for in Rom. viii, 16, 17, those to whom the Epistle
is
addressed are named “ children of God and
.1

THEIR DOCTRINE 89
joint-heirs with Christ ” ; and in Gal. iv, 7, we read : “ Where
fore tllou art no more a servant, but a son.” In the First
Epistle of John again Christians are declared to be “ children
of God” and “ begotten of God.” Since the term “ be
gotten ” implies a mother, and the writer also mentions the
seed of God, we may infer his concurrence with the belief of the Odist that the spiritual mother of pneumatic people is the
Holy Spirit. That certainly is Johannine doctrine, as we
may learn from Jn. iii, 6 and 8. Where the singer of the _ Ode boasted that, although a son of man, he was named the
illuminated one, he was probably thinking of the rite,
baptismal or other, in which he was “ named ”-—not having previously been—the son of God. Among the Gnostic sects
illumination was a prominent feature in the “ Mystery.” This holds good both for Christian and non-Christian Gnostics
and is probably the origin of the statement in the Gospel according to the Hebrews that a bright light shone upon the
Jordan when Jesus was baptized. In fact baptism was frequently termed photismos (illumination) 1 ; the person
baptized could therefore be called “ the illuminated one.”
In Ode XXV, which has been thought to be a baptismal ode,
there is evidence that “ illumination ” was a feature in the ritual of the community 0. The singer appears to be
referring to his initiatory experience. “ Thou didst set a lamp at my right hand and at my left . . . thou didst
remove from me my rayment of skin . . . and I became
admirable by the name of the Lord.” The removal of the rayment of skin may have been visibly accomplished through
some symbolic act. The phrase “ as it were a man ” in
Ode XIX, which is probably the correct translation, can be
understood from Daniel vii, l3, “ I saw one like the son of
man ”—i.e., “ like a man,” or “ as it were a man ”—the apparition being so described because the imaginary being
was not a single man but the figure of a nation, Israel.

90 THE ODES OF SOLOMON :
5. THE Cnms'r as Sorrosnn Srnms: Rssuasnc'rios
We find in the Odes references to persecution. It has been pointed out previouslythat people who were making
war against, idolatry were likely to incur the resentment of
those who had a vested interest in the worship 'of Pagan deities, and they would also become ,obnoxious to popular
superstition. It is fairly certain, too, that so anti-Judaic a community would be liable to persecution atthe hands of . bigoted orthodox Jews. No doubt the accounts of riots instigated by Jews against Paul have historical foundation,
and we read of Jewish rioting at Rome under Claudius. Such outbreaks would be sporadic and possibly not organized by the Jewish leaders, particularly not by the Pharisees.
It is probable that a few of the phrases have reference to
'spiritual adversaries, as in Ode V : “ My persecutors will come and not see me.” But they cannot all be explained
in that way. ' In some cases the persecution seems to
be existent or recent; in others to ’have ceased. Rioting
against the community would no doubt be repressed by the authorities and be intermittent. Such repression may be referred to in Ode XXV :
' Thou hast restrained those that rise up against me. . .
But I was despised and rejected in the eyes of many.
We may note again how persistently the writer borrows his phraseology from the Old Testament; the second clause
is obviously a reminiscence of Is. liii : “ He is despised and
rejected of men.” The amicted servant of God in this chapter of Isaiah is Israel; to apply the imagery of Isaiah to his own congregation was quite .in accordance with the usual procedure of the Odist. Christian writers of the second century applied the description to the rejection Of
Jesus by the Jews; but there is no evidence in the Odes
that the writer had ever heard of Jesus, and it is not sound critical method to interpret this very early work in the light
of later Christian dogma. A consequence of bias of that
kind is that certain Odes in which the suflerings of the com' munity are referred to in language derived from the Wisdom



THEIR DOCTRINE 91
incomprehensible metaphysical sense, conceived and borroodonly and beloved visible son, this cosmos.1 With even bei reason could the Odist have regarded spiritual man as tl.
beloved son of the perfect Virgin. Some Gnostics did in facv hold that Gnosis was the seed of God from which was begotten the pneumatic man.2 The metaphor of the Odist can be so interpreted. The womb of the Virgin, having taken the milk
of God —Gnosis —conceived and produced the pneumatic people. The idea was actually suggested by Wis. of Sol.
(ix, 1 and 2), where it is written that God created all things by his Word and formed man by his Wisdom. From this statement when Wisdom was pictured as a virgin, the transition to the description in the Ode was easy. We can
also trace to Wisdom some of the expressions used —e.g.,
" Wisdom is a spirit which loveth man " ; " she is unto men
a treasure that faileth not " ; " she makes them friends of
God " ; " Because of her I shall have glory among multi
tudes " ; " She shall guard me in her glory " ; " Through Wisdom were men saved." The explanation here given is proved almost conclusively to be correct by evidence found
in Ode XXXVI :
I rested on the Spirit of the Lord ; and she raised me on
high, and made me stand on my feet in the height of the
Lord, before his perfection and glory. . . . She brought
me forth before the face of the Lord ; and although a son
of man I was named the illuminated one, the son of God.
. . . For according to the goodness of the Most High she
made me; and according to his own newness he renewed
me ; and he anointed me from his own perfection.
We see in the above-quoted extract the connecting link
between Wis. ix, 2, and Ode XIX ; for here we have given as equivalent the two statements that Wisdom (the Spirit of
the Lord) " made me " and that she " brought me forth."
Traces of this original view are found in the later Gnosticism.
In the Acts of Thomas, in an invocation at the end of chapter
xxx ix, Sophia is addressed as " the Mother of all creatures."
1 According to Philo, God had two sons, an elder, the invisible
Logos, and a younger, the visible cosmos. In the Hermetic writings
the cosmos is the visible image of the invisible Logos.

It can be inferred from the parallel passages that the theme of the Ode
is
the sufferings of the righteous. To assume that, because Christian writers of the second century applied some of these verses and similar ones to Jesus, the Odist must have been applying them to his Christ
is
quite illogical. The Ode must be judged on its own character without prepossession. The writer had never breathed the atmosphere of the New Testament. His affinities are with certain books of the Old. He borrows their phraseology, but never treats their language as prophetic. Some of the expressions used in the Ode are inapplicable to the crucifixion
of the Christ. Verse 14, " They sought for my death and
did not find it," could only by a very forced interpretation be taken as referring to the Resurrection. The plain mean ing of the words
is
that the speaker did not die at all. The
" salvation " mentioned in verse
9
is
evidently the writer's
own salvation; and the term " oppression " could not be appropriately used of the Crucifixion. The lack of zeal
(verse
9)
can be understood from the Biblical phrase, " the



THEIR DOCTRINE 93
zeal of thy house has eaten me up." The Gnostic com
munity had no zeal either for the Temple or for the Law; and to Jews who believed that salvation could come only through the Law, men who had rejected the Law would
necessarily seem to be among " the lost." The Odist, holding the Gnostic opinion that the body is merely the perishable garment of the soul and that the real Ego was
the immortal spirit which he had received from " the Life," would naturally declare that his birth was not like the birth of his persecutors and could boast that God was his father.
A writer for whom the " Thought " of God was a kind of
spiritual substance —equivalent in fact to the Nous of the
Hermetic writings—would imagine his pre-existence in the Thought of God as a real existence. That is the point of his
statements that he was " older than their recollection," " for nothing is prior to the thought of the Most High." We
may compare a " word of the Lord " concerning the elect in
Ode VIII : " Before they came into being I took knowledge of them." Belief in the pre-existence of the soul is found
in later Gnostic writings—e.g. , in the Hymn of the Soul. The
idea that the saints are of a different race from ordinary men was also prevalent among Gnostics. Basilides named the
elect of the world " foreign " as belonging by nature to the
world above.1 Valentinus wrote of " the superior race " of the Gnostics, which, he said, had descended from above into this world for the annihilation of death.2 According to the Marcosians the ascending soul, whose race has been derived
from the pre-existent God, returns to its own.3 In the
Hermetic literature again we read : " Gnostics appear to the multitude to be mad and are ridiculed, hated, despised, and even killed." 4 The water carried in the right hand may symbolize Gnosis, the water of life. Whoever carried that water must needs be sweet. To what degree the members of the community were able to attain to the ethical level of their leader cannot of course be told. He at any rate believed it to be wrong to
return evil for evil and hatred for hatred. It would be very

3 Iren., I, xxi, 5. 4 Corp. Herm., IX, 4.



94 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
unreasonable to suppose that no one but a divine Christ could have such thoughts. Pagans could cherish them, as
we know. We find again in Ode XLI the idea that the elect
are of different birth —sc. spiritual birth —from the carnal
man :
1. All the Lord's children will praise him . . . and his
children will be known tb him. 3. We live in the Lord by
his grace; and life we receive in his Christ. ... 8. All
those will be astonished that see me, for from another race
am I. 9. For the Father of truth remembered me; he
who possessed me from the beginning. 10. For his bounty
begat me and the thought of his heart. 11. And his Word
is with us all our way.
There is really no justification for the supposition that the Christ suddenly begins to speak with verse 8 and as suddenly ceases to do so at verse 11, notwithstanding the change in the number of the personal pronoun. The change is quite easy to understand when we picture to ourselves the whole congregation singing the hymn together. Each member could speak for himself separately in the singular or for the united body in the plural. There is, however, another possible explanation of the change of number. Philo says that at the close of the common meal of the Therapeuts a hymn was sung, and that the head of the community and the members sang alternately. We may suppose that in this and others of the Odes the same thing happened, in this case the members singing verses 1 to 7 and verses 11 ff., and the leader verses 8 to 10 by himself.1 Verse 8 is sufficiently explained by verse 1. People who believed themselves to be peculiarly the children of the Lord must of course have claimed to be of a different race from those who were not considered by them to be children of the Lord. Verse 9 applies very well to the singer or the writer of the Ode, but
not well to the Christ. And it is only necessary to read consecutively verses 10 and 11 to see how extremely unlikely it is that the Word, who is the subject of 11, should have been the speaker of 10. The idea that the children of the

Psalms no certain inference can be deduced from it. Cp. Ps. xliv,
lxvi, lxxiv, cviii.



THEIR DOCTRINE 95
Lord must in some manner differ in appearance from other men was in the days of the Odist not an unnatural one, or even one for the existence of which there is no independent
evidence. It is found again in Ode XVII :
I was crowned by my God; my crown is living. ... I
have been delivered from vanity. . . . My chains have been
cut off by his hands ; I received the face and fashion of a
new person and all that have seen me were amazed ; and
I was regarded by them as a strange person; and he who
knew and brought me up is the Most High.
There is contemporary evidence that Gnostics were thought by some people to be mad. The Word is speech;
it cannot therefore be speaker. It is the speech of God ;
personified, it is true. It can, however, be received and
uttered by those who are qualified to receive it. Hence it
is possible to find in the Odes an " utterance of the Word,"
but in such a case it is not the Word which " utters " ; it is
" uttered," as the Word of God. The conception of utter ance divinely inspired in a far more literal way than that in
which a modern would think of it was Greek and preChristian. The technical term for the state of mind which produced it was enthusiasm. We find the conception fully
developed in Philo —e.g., " The instrument of God is a
giver of sound which is struck invisibly by him " ; and
again : " For in reality the prophet even when he seems to
be speaking is silent as regards utterance of truth ; it is one not himself who uses his organs of speech, his mouth and
tongue, to reveal what he wishes." We may see from Ode VI
that this was precisely the view of the Odist :
As the hand moves over the harp and the strings speak,
so speaks in my members the Spirit of the Lord, and I speak
by his love.
Hence an ostensible utterance of the Word in any Ode is not the speech of an individual Christ, but the inspired utterance of the writer. We learn this also from some
verses of Ode X previously quoted, which I quote again because they contribute materially to the comprehension
of the very important Ode XLH :



96 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
The Lord hath directed my mouth by his Word, and gave
me that I might speak the fruit of his peace, to convert the
souls of those who are willing to come to him. . . . And the
Gentiles were gathered together . . . and they walked in
my life and were saved and became my people for ever and
In these verses the theme of Ode XLII is foreshadowed.
In this case again I place in a parallel column the sources of the writer's phraseology.

and approached my Lord ; for
the outstretching of my hands
is his sign.
2. My outstretching is the

22. And I heard their voice ;

This Ode is considered by all the commentators to be a description of the descent of the Christ into Hell. There are, however, some weighty reasons for doubting whether
that opinion is correct. One ground for hesitation is that
there is no support for it in the Wisdom of Solomon. The
conception of Wisdom in that book is incompatible with the supposition that she descended into Hades to awaken any
of the dead ; and so is the general doctrine of the writer.



98 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
But that doctrine, with the substitution of the Word for Wisdom, was substantially the doctrine of the Odist, and the descent of the Word into Hades is equally difficult to reconcile with it. The doctrine of Wisdom, clear and explicit, is that the righteous live for ever; those who trust in the Lord are assured of eternal life, and would never have found themselves in Hades at all. The ungodly, who do not trust
in the Lord, " shall become a dishonoured carcase." There
is no possible return from Hades for them. " Death " and
" life," both in this doctrine and in that of the Odist, are
spiritual death and life. In Wis. v, 13, quoted above, the
wicked are made to say : " So we, as soon as we were born,
ceased to be." They are spiritually " dead " from the first moment of their lives. Presumably there is hope for them so long as they are physically alive ; but when their body
has become " a dishonoured carcase," they are irrevocably
dead. As it is written in iii, 10 and 11 :
The ungodly shall be requited even as they reasoned, and
void is their hope and their toils unprofitable.
The righteous on the other hand are spiritually alive and
remain alive, whatever may be the fate of the body. In the
eyes of the foolish " they seem to have died " (Wis. iii, 2).
Death of the body, therefore, is not really death as the writer
understands the word ; so that it is unnecessary for a divine being to go down into Sheol for the salvation of the righteous.
Again we read : " Hades hath not royal dominion upon earth, for righteousness is immortal," Wis. i, 14. Conse
quently the Christian doctrine that death had to be " con
quered " by Christ has no application. /The doctrine of the descent of Wisdom, or of the Word, into Hades implies the temporary death of all men with a future resurrection of the righteous ; and that belief is as foreign to the Odes as it is to the Wisdom of Solomon. Nor does it fit in at all well
with the Odist's conception of the Word. Ode XV seems to
be conclusive on this point :
I have put on incorruption through his name ; I have put
off corruption by his grace ; Death has been destroyed before
my face ; Sheol has been abolished by his Word.



THEIR DOCTRINE 99
There can be no doubt in this case who is the speaker,
and the meaning is plain. He who has received " grace "
is deathless. For him Sheol has been abolished, since he
has received from the " Life " an immortal spirit which will never go down into Sheol. The body perishes without hope of resurrection. Those who have not received the divine
spirit must perish eternally ; " corruption " is their inevitable
end ; if they have not received " grace " before their death they cannot be imagined to receive it afterwards ; Sheol has not been abolished for them. The writer's doctrine in this respect is characteristically Gnostic.
It is evident that in verses 1 and 2 of Ode XLII the speaker is the writer himself, or perhaps rather the singer of the verses. Now verses 2 and 3 are coupled by the conjunction
" And." It is very unlikely that the verbs in these two
verses should have a different grammatical subject. In verse 13 expressions are repeated which have been found in another context where the writer was speaking of himself. The tenor of the whole is explicable from the parallel pas sages of Wisdom of which the subject is the experience of the righteous man.
How then, it may be asked, could the writer say that
" Sheol saw me " ? That question must now be considered.
The generally accepted explanation of the Ode assumes
that by " life " the writer meant mortal life, by " death "
the death of the body, and by Sheol a real place. But, considering his habitual employment of figurative expres sions, it cannot be right to take any description of his literally as a matter of course ; particularly when a description taken literally cannot be brought into harmony with his funda mental doctrine. Verse 1 of the Ode is a paraphrase of
Ps. lxxxviii, 9. In the same Psalm we find the following :
" Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit [= Sheol], in darkness,
in the deeps." If the Psalmist could write of himself as metaphorically dead, the Odist could write of the ungodly as metaphorically dead. And dead in his sense of the word they would be. Let us, then, make the hypothesis that the language of
this description is symbolic, and that " I " in this Ode



100 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
means the writer or the congregation he represents, and see whether so interpreted the description is consistent with the writer's doctrine, and in its details probable and intelligible.
" They have sought me," he writes, " who set their hope
upon me because I live." That would be quite a likely thing for him to say regarding proselytes who have become convinced that to him and his congregation had been re vealed the means of securing eternal life. No doubt he would have in mind the thought that the source of his life was the indwelling Word, and that those who sought him
sought the Word through him. He " lives " because he has
received from " the Life " the " Spirit of the Lord " which is within him (Ode XXVIII). By implication those who have
not received the Spirit of the Lord do not live ; they are
" dead men." In the vision of Ezekiel, which the writer certainly had in mind, the dry bones symbolize the erring
and scattered " house of Israel," spiritually dead. The breath of God makes of the people who were metaphorically
dead and in their graves (verse 12) —in other words, in Sheol
—an army of the living. So could the congregation of the elect by receiving Pagan proselytes and enabling them to be quickened by the Spirit of the Lord (the breath of God)
make of Death's dead men a congregation of living men.
These proselytes would be the people who " took hold of
me." The explanation of the statement " I did not perish
though they thought it of me " is given in the parallel verse
of Wisdom, " In the eyes of the foolish they [the righteous]
seem to have died." The writer is not speaking of himself individually, but as a type of the righteous in general. The
member of the congregation who sang the words " Sheol saw
me ... and Death gave me back " would apply them to
his own conversion in accordance with the Gnostic conception
of ignorance of God as spiritual death. In Ode XXI we
read :
My arms I lifted up on high, even to the grace of the Lord ;
because he had cast off my bonds from me . . . and I put
off darkness and clothed myself with light.
Are we to take this as meaning that an individual Christ



THEIR DOCTRINE 101
had cast off from the writer material bonds and brought him out of physical darkness ? Bringing out of darkness into light is a variant metaphor for bringing out of Sheol.
If one is figure of speech, so is the other. A similar meta
phorical use of " bonds " is found in the Prayer ofManasses :
" I am bound down with many iron bands, that I cannot lift up my head by reason of my sins." The Ode under consideration could be regarded as expand
ing the thought of Ode X. There the writer declares that he has been commissioned to convert the souls who were willing to come to the Word; which of course means to
become members of his congregation; and he rejoices
probably in large measure in anticipation—over those who
walked in his life and were saved. And, since being saved is equivalent to becoming participants in the eternal life
which the community has secured through the Word, it is in a very important sense a resurrection from the dead.
This conception of " resurrection " was characteristic of Gnostics, disbelieving as they did in a resurrection of the body. According to Tertullian the disciples of Basilides held that death is not separation of body and soul, but ignorance of God, and that believers have already risen from the dead. This must also have been the doctrine of
the Odist, because in Ode XLI he speaks of " the Saviour
who makes alive." There is no difference between " making
alive " and raising from the dead. In Ode XXXIV again
we read : " Grace has been revealed for your salvation.
Believe and live and be saved "—which implies that those who do not believe do not live; they are "dead men."
Irenaeus (II, xxxi, 2) says that Gnostics understood by
resurrection from the dead knowledge of that which is called by them the truth. And Philo in several passages identifies
" Hades " with the life of the godless here upon earth. There is reason to think that in one at least of the passages
(De Somn. I, 151) he may be reproducing an opinion already
current in his time. Anyone who held that opinion could,
of course, say that conversion of the godless was bringing
them out of Hades. Hence we are not obliged to suppose
that the speaker is the Christ or that a literal descent into



102 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
Hell is in view. The Saviour is, no doubt, the Word ; but
if we are to interpret the passage in conformity with the spirit and doctrine of the Odes we must conclude that the Word operates through the community, the visible Christ,
and that the " resurrection " is a spiritual and metaphorical one. Tertullian 1 complains that heretics deceive people by using expressions which, when literally understood, sound orthodox, while attaching to them in their own minds a
peculiar significance. " They confess," he says, " that resurrection must be in the flesh ; but tacitly their meaning is that everyone while in the flesh must have learnt the heretical secret doctrines, for that is what they mean by resurrection." Similarly the Odist while appearing to say one thing meant something different. Not, however, with any intention to deceive, but because metaphorical expression was natural to him. His own readers would not be deceived, but modern commentators have been. Verses 18 to 22 appear to have been written with the corre sponding verses of Wisdom in view ; but the appeal of the dead to the Son of God has been grafted upon those verses, and it is pretty clearly implied that all the dead are brought
by the Son of God out of Sheol. It is impossible that such an idea can have been in the mind of the original writer.
It is inconsistent with the statement in verse 17 that " I made a congregation of living men among his dead men." Obviously all carnal men would not be supposed capable of being made spiritual, nor could it be supposed that every wicked man who had gone down to Sheol for his sins would be brought out thence. The writer of these verses may perhaps have been thinking of some future day when every one would be spiritual or when the wicked would have been sufliciently punished; but neither possibility was in the mind of the writer of verse 17. Moreover, is it likely, or
1 De Cam. Res., 19. Hoc denique ingenio ot iam in conloquiis
saepe nostros decipere consucrunt, quasi et ipsi resurrectionem carnis
admittant. " Vao," inquiunt, " qui non in hac oarno resurrexerit :
. . . Tacite autem secundum conscientiam suam hoc sentiunt :
Vae, qui non, dum in hac came est, cognoverit arcana haeretica;
hoc est enim apud illos resurrectio."



THEIR DOCTRINE 103
even possible, that the writer, after recording his revival of the dead in verses 14 to 17 and sealing his record with the
final-looking phrase " because my word shall not be void,"
would have thought it necessary to begin all over again
and describe a second —this time an indiscriminate redemption of dead men ? And when we observe that the second description concludes with the only verse of the whole section which can be attributed more naturally to the Christ than to the writer, we are compelled to suspect that the verses were added by a Christian whose Son of God was more of a real person than the Word of the Odist, and who had in mind the later Catholic Christian dogma of the literal descent of Jesus into Hell. There is no reason, apart from the knowledge that the
dogma read into it did exist in the second century, for taking this Ode as literally meant. The chief motive for the formulation of the dogma was the thought that salvation should be offered to the righteous who had died before the
coming of Christ. But there is no indication in the Odes that this thought had occurred to the writer ; and there is no reference to the dogma in the earliest Christian literature.
Justin (Dial., 46) says that all who lived righteously and
pleased God before the coming of Christ will be saved ; also
that death will be " destroyed " at his second coming. Among Gnostics there was a belief that the Logos had appeared to saintly men before he became generally known. The oldest trace of the dogma is found in a Syrian fragment
of the Apology of Aristides (125 c.e.) : " When our Lord rose
from the dead and ground Death beneath his feet and conquered him, powerful though he was, and set man free." This statement, however, does not imply that Christ, when he rose, brought up souls out of Hell with him. The doctrine is not Gnostic. Bousset 1 traces the belief to the very widely spread myth of a combat between the prince of life and the princes and powers of the underworld. No doubt, as he observes, many such myths were absorbed and were popu larly current in the communities before they made their appearance in the literature. The leaders, he supposes,

104 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
would be likely to refine upon the popular mythology.
Gnostics in particular interpreted it symbolically. The doctrine in question could more easily have originated in Judaic circles in which there was belief in a bodily resur
rection. In fact, in the Apocalypse of John, a Jesus who is
unrecognizable as the Jesus of the Gospels proclaims, " I
was dead and am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades."
Proof that the symbolic interpretation of Ode XLII is
correct is found in Ode XXIX, where the context admits of no doubt that the member of the congregation who sings the
Ode is speaking of himself :
The Lord brought me up out of the depths of the under
world [Sheol] and from the jaws of death he withdrew me.
And I caused my adversaries to bend down, and he pro
nounced me righteous in his kindness, for I believed in the
Lord's Christ.
Since he who believed in the Lord's Christ was certainly not the Christ, and the singer cannot have been literally brought up out of Sheol, the necessity for symbolic interpre
tation is demonstrated. We see also that " the Lord," in spite of the attribution of kindness, is God. The meaning of the delivery from the jaws of death must be the same as
of the liberation from the " bonds of darkness " which are
bonds of spiritual error. The " adversaries " in this Ode are spiritual adversaries of the soul. The statement that
" the Lord brought me up out of the depths of the under
world " illuminates Ode XXII, in which the speaker has
been thought to be the Christ :
1. He who brought me down from on high also brought
me up from the region below ; 2. and he who gathers together
the things that are betwixt is he also who cast me down.
[Coptic : ho who removed those who were in the midst has
taught me concerning them.] 3. He who scattered my
enemies and my adversaries ; 4. he who gave mo authority
over bonds that I might loose them ; 5. he that overthrew
by my hands the dragon with seven heads ; and thou hast
set me over his roots that I might destroy his seed ; 0. thou
wast there and didst help me and in every place thy name
was a rampart to me. 7. Thy right hand has destroyed his
wicked poison ; and thy hand has levelled the way for those



THEIR DOCTRINE 105
»
who believe in thee; 8. and thou didst choose them from
the graves and didst cover them with bodies ; 9. they were
motionless and thou didst give them energy for life. 10.
Thy way was without corruption, and thy face; 11. thou
didst bring thy world to corruption, that everything might
be dissolved and then renewed, 12. and that the foundation
for everything might be thy rock; and on it thou didst
build thy kingdom ; and it became the dwelling-place of the saints.
Verses 1, 2, and 6 are sufficient to show who the speaker is supposed to be. The Christ might have said that God
had " brought him down "—though " sent " would have
been more appropriate —but he cannot be imagined to have
said that God " cast him down." The verse is obscure and perhaps corrupt, but the casting down must have been into
the region below whence the singer had been " brought up."
The agent would be a spiritual adversary —perhaps the
dragon mentioned later on. Nor, if we accept the Coptic
reading —though that is not likely to be original —did the
Christ need to be " taught " concerning " those who were in
the midst "—i.e., planetary evil powers. And surely it must have been the writer, or the singer, who needed God's
name as a " rampart." There is nothing in the Ode incon sistent with this supposition. We have seen in another Ode
the writer's belief that as an immortal spirit he haJ been in existence before his physical birth. That was a Gnostic
idea of which we have evidence in the Hymn of the Soul :
When quite a little child I was dwelling in the house of
my Father's kingdom. . . . From the East, our home, my
parents sent me forth with journey provision. . . . They
girt me with adamant that hath power to cut even iron.
The hymn is an allegorical account of the journey of the soul from Heaven to earth in search of a pearl (Gnosis).
Eventually the soul, having found and secured the pearl, returns to Heaven. Belief in the pre-existence of the human soul was current in Philo's time ; for he in several passages expresses the opinion that the soul had quitted Heaven and was a temporary sojourner here below in a foreign land.1
1 Esp. De Somn., I, § 181.
H— O.O.



106 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
The second half of verse 1 can be understood from Ode XXIX, previously quoted, in which it is the singer himself who
says he had been " brought up." In neither of these Odes
nor in XLII is it meant that a soul having descended literally
into Sheol was afterwards rescued. It is through their holding that erroneous opinion that the literalizing com mentators imagine the speaker in this Ode to be the Christ ; but the Ode as a whole does not require that assumption.
Verse 4 of Ode XXII— " he who gave me authority over
bonds that I might loose them "—must be understood as a
metaphorical restatement of some verses in Ode X, previously quoted, which affirm the writer's divine commission to convert the Gentiles. And that work could be regarded as an overcoming of the dragon, a symbolic expression for
" the Destroyer." The seven heads may symbolize the seven sins which in later Gnostic doctrine were connected with the seven planetary Archons. The dragon is probably the dragon of Revelation xii, 9; but of course the con ception is much older than that book. The enemies and adversaries of verse 3 are no doubt, bike the adversaries of
Ode XXIX, spiritual adversaries of the soul. Since verses 8 and 9 are based upon the vision of Ezekiel there can be no
reason for doubting that verse 17 of Ode XLII is based upon
that vision, and it would be perversity not to recognize the fact that in both these passages, as in Ezekiel, the reviving of the dead signifies the bringing of men out of the darkness
of error and sin into the light of truth. " Those who believe
in thee " (verse 7) cannot be people who had been literally
" chosen from the graves." The Ode is perfectly intelligible on the supposition that the writer himself is the speaker throughout. Verses 11 and 12 are clearly an address to God from the writer or the singer of the Ode.
The " adamant " of the Hymn of the Soul which had power
to cut even iron illuminates the reference to " bonds " in
Ode XXII, and also a phrase in Ode XVII, thereby furnish ing a clue for the understanding of the whole. The bonds
are bonds of religious error, " bonds of darkness," which
could figuratively be imagined to be of iron. In fact in the verse previously quoted from the Prayer of Manasses the



THEIR DOCTRINE 107
bonds of sin are termed " iron bands." Earlier in the Ode the writer prepares for the understanding of his figurative language by saying that his own chains had been cut off by the hands of God. Having thus himself been freed from
the chains of error, he was in a position to free others :
8. I opened the doors that were closed, 9. and I broke in
pieces the bars of iron ; but my iron melted and dissolved
before me. 10. Nothing appeared closed to me ; because I
was the door of everything. 11. And I went over the
bondmen to loose them, that I might not leave any bound
or any bonds. 12. And I imparted my Gnosis without
grudging and my prayer was in my love ; 13. and I sowed
my fruit in hearts and transformed them into myself 1 ;
and they received my blessing and lived ; 14. and they were
gathered to me and were saved; 15. because they were to
me as my own members and I was their head. 16. Glory
to thee our head the Lord Christ.
The theme is the same as in XXII and XLII—viz., the conversion of Pagans and their reception into the community.
" They were gathered to me and were saved." The writer no doubt may have been thinking of himself as the represent ative of the congregation which was the visible body of the
Christ. The congregation of saints was " the door of every
thing," because initiation into it and its mysteries was the condition of union with the Word and the reception of Gnosis, guaranteeing eternal life. We see again in verse 13 the writer's conception of religious error as death and entrance into the congregation as becoming alive. He was a Jew and the congregation must have consisted originally of Jews ; but he had no racial prejudice, his love was for all who would accept it, and converted Pagans were to him as
his " own members." It was inferred from the character
of Ode IX that the writer was the head of his congregation. This inference clears up a possible ambiguity in verses 15 and 16. The community would have two heads : the visible, official head, and the invisible spiritual head. The thought that the Word would be the spiritual head of
1 Cp. the Marcosian formula previously quoted : " Receive first
grace from me and through me, that thou mayest be what I am
and I what thou art."



108 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
the community is not incompatible with the doctrine of the
Odes, but the originality of the expression " Lord Christ "
may properly be questioned because it occurs only here and in one other Ode. Rendel Harris, indeed, renders the first
line of Ode XXIV : " The dove flew over the head of the
Lord Messiah " ; but Dr. Bernard, with better judgment,
omits the word " Lord." The word is not to be found here in one of the MSS. (H), and it is more likely to have been inserted by a Christian copyist than to have been omitted. The German translators Ungnad and Staerk also did not
consider the expression " Lord Christ " to be original in that Ode. The only other Ode in which the expression
is found is XXXIX, which therefore calls for critical
examination :
Great rivers are the power of the Lord. . . . Those who
cross them in faith are not moved. The Lord has bridged
them by his Word; and he walked and crossed them on
foot. And his footsteps stand on the waters and were not
erased. They are as a beam that is firmly fixed. And the
waves were lifted up on this side and on that, and the foot
steps of our Lord Christ stand, and are not obliterated and
are not defaced.
The phraseology is highly metaphorical, and the meaning
not particularly clear. But for our present purpose the important point is that the footsteps of the Word are imagined to he upon the surface of the water like a solid beam upon which the faithful can cross. Then superfluously follows an entirely incongruous idea, no doubt suggested by the passage of the Israelites through the Red Sea. Now the faithful might be supposed to cross the river by the bridge to which in a very bold metaphor the footsteps of the Word are likened, or alternatively he might be supposed to cross on the dry river-bed left by the lifting up of the waves. But the one method of crossing excludes the other. More
over the repetition observable in the sentence " And are not
obliterated and are not defaced " is clumsy and inappropriate.
In the first case it is important that the footsteps on the surface of the water should remain, since they act as a beam
for the crossing. But if the water is heaped up, leaving the



THEIR DOCTRINE 109
bottom dry, the footsteps become unimportant. There is, to say the least, very strong ground for the suspicion that the second similitude was added by a Christian copyist. Then
again the passage concludes with the words " a way has been appointed . . . for those who agree to the course of his
faith." A believer could have faith in the Word; but the
expression " faith of the Word " (his faith) cannot have been
written by the Odist. The phrase " those who agree to the
course of his faith " is not at all in his style. Since therefore
the title " the Lord Christ " was in all probability inserted in two places in the Odes, the originality of the third may
well be doubted. The line " Glory to thee our head the
Lord Christ," with which Ode XVII terminates, may be inferred to be a later addition to the Ode. Another Ode in which the speaker has been thought to be
the Christ is XXXI. It has been shown previously that this Ode has probably suffered interpolation. The exceptional individualization of the Word in the interpolated verses has contributed to the belief that he is the speaker of those which follow. But the chief reason for the belief is the affinity between the phraseology of the Ode and certain phrases in the Gospel account of the Passion. These phrases, however, as critics of the New Testament have recognized, were taken from the twenty-second Psalm and the fifty-third chapter
of Isaiah. It is certain that the source of the Odist's phraseology was the same. The two chapters referred to depict poetically and symbolically the sufferings of Israel. Why, then, should not the Odist have employed their phraseology to express the sufferings of his own con gregation ? We have seen that in some of the Odes the writer complains of persecution, probably chiefly by orthodox Jews. To anyone who has appreciated the writer's conception
of the Word it must appear impossible that he could have
represented him as speaking in the terms here found :
Error went astray and perished at his hand, and folly
found no path to walk in and was submerged by the truth
of the Lord. And they denounced me as a criminal when I
showed myself, me who had never been a criminal ; and they
divided my spoil, though nothing was due to them. But I



110 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
endured and held my peace and was silent, as if not moved
by them. But I stood unshaken like a firm rock which is
beaten by the waves and endures. And I bore their bitter
ness for humility's sake [in order that I might redeem my
people and inherit it].
In the Gospels Jesus is not denounced as " a criminal " :
nor is it the denouncers who divide his garments. No one
has any right to say that in this Ode " spoil " means
" garments." It is most improbable. The Odist is no doubt
depending directly upon the Psalm, and it is a reasonable
inference that he deliberately substituted " spoil " for
" garments " because the latter word was not applicable to his case. He had never seen a Gospel ; and since, in the opinion of the best critics, the dividing of the garments of Jesus was an invention prompted by the supposed prophecy and never really happened, the Odist can have known
nothing about it. The concluding verse is intelligible if the
persecutors were Jews and the writer, as a Jew himself, desired their conversion ; but his universalistic anti- Judaism would certainly have prevented him from allowing the
Christ to speak of the Jews as " my people." His Christ had no nationality.1
In Ode VIII we have an " utterance of the Word " in the sense previously explained. The prophets who introduced
their proclamations with the phrase " Thus saith the Lord "
could equally well have said " Hear the word of the Lord " ;
and that is what the Odist does. If the Word may be imagined to be the speaker, he is speaking by the mouth of
the writer, and the utterance is in reality " the word of God."
8. Hear the word of truth and receive the knowledge of
the Most High. 9. Your flesh does not know what I am
saying to you ; nor your rayment what I am showing you.
... 14. I do not turn my face away from those who are
mine, for I know them. Before they came into being I
took knowledge of them, and on their faces I set my seal.
16. I fashioned their members ; my own breasts I prepared
for them, that they might drink my holy milk and live
1 Since it was shown previously (p. 66) that the two immediately
following verses have been interpolated, the possibility that this line
is part of the interpolation cannot be excluded.



THEIR DOCTRINE 111
thereby. 17. My workmanship are they and the strength
of my thoughts. ... 19. I willed and fashioned mind and
heart ; and they are mine. 20. And by my own right hand
I set my elect ones ; and my righteousness goes before them.
. . . 24. Abide ye beloved ones in the Beloved, those who
are kept in him that liveth, and they that are saved in him
who saves.
The Odist could not with his conception of the Most High allow him to speak in person, but it should be obvious that the utterance in this Ode is the utterance of God. We have
seen in an Ode previously quoted that the " breasts " and
the " milk " are the breasts and the milk of God. With
verse 14 we may compare " his [God's] children will be
known to him " from Ode XLI ; and with " my elect " in
verse 19, " grace is of the elect " (Ode XXIII) compared
with " Grace and mercy are with his [God's] chosen "
(Wis. iv, 15). And it is certainly God who " fashioned mind
and heart " and set his own seal upon the faces of his chosen.
In verse 24 the Odist speaks in his own person. In verse 9 also he is expressing his own contempt for the flesh. God in
these Odes as in Job and the canonical Psalms is " Saviour "
and " Redeemer." Hence the MS. reading " he who was
saved " in verse 24 is almost certainly wrong. Clause 3
paraphrases clause 2. God " saves " because he " lives,"
and is thus the cause of life to those who " abide in him."
The " Beloved," as elsewhere in these Odes, is God. With
verse 20 we may compare Isa. lviii, 8 : " thy righteousness shall go before thee."
In the earlier part of Ode VIII there is reference to per
secution which, when the Ode was written, had ceased :
Rise up and stand erect, ye who were sometimes brought
low. Ye who were in silence speak out [now] that your
mouth has been opened. Ye who were despised be lifted
up, now that your righteousness has been lifted up. . . .
Peace has been prepared for you before ever your war happened.
We may see from these verses how rash is the assumption that when the Odist, writing of his persecutors, says that he kept silence before them, or that he was without reason despised, he must have been recording an utterance of the



112 THE ODES OF SOLOMON:
Christ. Even Harris, who eagerly makes the assumption
whenever he thinks he can, admits that in this Ode " the saints have gone through a variety of conflicts. Some struggle has evidently gone on which is not covered by the individual conflict for inward illumination and liberty."
But if in this Ode, why not in others ?
6. The Water of Life. The Bridegroom
In Ode VI the triumph of Gnosis and the overthrow of Judaism and polytheism are foretold. The author projects himself in imagination into the future and with the mind's
eye beholds the salvation of the world :
3. He destroys what is foreign and everything is of the
Lord ... 5. that nothing should be his adversary and
nothing should stand up against him. 6. The Lord has
multiplied his knowledge. ... 7. Our spirits praise his
Holy Spirit. 8. For there went forth a stream and it be
came a river great and broad. It carried away and pulver
ized everything ; and has carried away the Temple also. . . .
10. For it spread over the face of all the earth and filled
everything. 11. All the thirsty who were upon earth were
given to drink of it, and thirst was done away and quenched ;
12. for from the Most High the draught was given. 13.
Blessed are the ministers of that draught, who have been
entrusted with that water of his. They have assuaged the
dry lips. . . . 15. And souls that were in dissolution they
have established and restored. . . . 17. For everyone knew
them in the Lord and they became living through the
perpetual living water.
The signification of the river which is to sweep away error
and false worship is given in verse 6 ; it is " knowledge of the
Lord "—i.e., Gnosis —and this is the water of life. The ministers of the draught, who have been entrusted with the water, are plainly the community of saints, the recipients of the Holy Spirit. Verses 15 and 17 are important, for they
prove the correctness of the interpretation of Ode XLII. The water of life restores dead souls to life ; not the souls of dead people, but souls which were spiritually dead. Meta
phorically—and only metaphorically —these souls are
" brought out of Sheol." The Christ who brings them out is
the community inspired by the Word. A congregation which



THEIR DOCTRINE 113
had been entrusted with such a gift could quite appro
priately be said to be " the door of everything." The sources of the imagery have been quoted previously. They are Wis. i, 7; Isa. xi, 9; Ecclus. xxiv, 30; Wis. vii, 30, viii, 13.
In the emphasis laid upon Truth in these Odes, and especially in the personification of it, we see again the genesis
of a Gnostic conception. At this early stage Truth has not become, as it became later, a divine being existing in
dependently of God or the Word. In Ode XXXII the
" Truth who was self-originate " is God; in Ode XXXVIII Truth appears to be the Word ; but God and the Word, as
we have seen, are not separable. Afterwards —e.g., by the
Marcosians and the Valentinians —Truth is separately personified under the Greek name Aletheia. She is termed
" the Mother," and by the former she is set at the side of the Father in the highest Heaven. An ultimate connection is inferable from the statement of Irenaeus (I, xxix, 2) that
in the system of certain Gnostics Aletheia is paired with the
" Self-born." This pair seems to have been arrived at by
splitting the Truth who was " self-originate " into two.
In Ode XXXVIII " the light of Truth " is Gnosis :
I went up to the light of Truth as if into a chariot ; and
Truth took me and led me, and carried me across pits and
gullies; and from the rocks and waves he preserved me;
and he became to me a haven of salvation and set me on the
arms of immortal Life. And he went with me and made
me rest and suffered me not to wander because he was the
Truth. And I ran no risk because I walked with him ; and
I did not make an error in anything because I obeyed the
Truth. For error flees away from him and meets him not ;
but Truth proceeds in the right path; and whatever I did
not know he made clear to me, all the poisons of error and
the plagues of death which are thought to be sweetness.
And I saw the corrupter of corruption, when the bride who
is corrupted was adorned ; and the bridegroom who corrupts
and is corrupt. And I asked of Truth : Who are these ?
and he said to me : This is the deceiver and the error ; and
they imitate the Beloved and his bride; and they lead
astray and corrupt the world. And they invite many to
the banquet and give them to drink of the wine of their
intoxication, and they make them vomit up their wisdom



116 THE ODES OF SOLOMON :
in the Psalms and in Isaiah. The expression " knowledge of
God " is to be found in Isaiah. In the Wisdom literature
this " knowledge " with a somewhat expanded significance
is personified as " Wisdom." As we read in Prov.
ii,
6,
" The Lord giveth wisdom
;
out of his mouth cometh
knowledge and understanding." In the Wisdom
of
Solomon, though wisdom as an abstract quality still includes knowledge as well as understanding, a separation
is
made by regarding
the personified Wisdom as the bringer of knowledge. An advance upon this conception could not fail to come about, because practically
it
meant that Wisdom brought herself. And since
it
had been said that wisdom, knowledge, and
understanding had come " out of the mouth " of the Lord, the next step naturally was to imagine that they had been brought to men through the word of God. The expression
" the word of God " would be familiar to the Odist from the Psalms
;
and in one passage in the Wisdom
of
Solomon the Word
is
personified. The Logos had also been personified in the Helleno -Egyptian theosophy, of which
it
is
probable that the Odist had some knowledge. Hence the Word replaced Wisdom, both as the personification of an ab straction and yet also, like Wisdom, as a divine Spirit and the bringer of divine knowledge.1 The Word, then, as the utterance of God, was conceived as a part of himself, and at the same time as having objective existence. But, since the utterance of God
is
not physically audible, just as Wisdom was supposed to become known through entering as a spiritual emanation from God into the souls of men, so does the Word bring the knowledge of God by inward spiritual penetration. And notwithstanding the personification, he
is
no more a
" person " than Wisdom
is
a person. He
is
said to have
" appeared "
;
but so also did Wisdom " appear."
She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the
coming in at the doors. Prov. viii, 3.
The mind of the Odist was steeped in this literature; he wrote in the same spirit and employed the same kind of metaphor. To imagine that when he wrote of the Word he
1
Justin affirmed the identity of Logos and Wisdom on the
authority of earlier writers, including the Book of Proverbs.



THEIR DOCTRINE 117
was thinking of some historical person or that when he
gave to the Word the Jewish appellation " the Christ " he was referring to Christ Jesus, of whom he had certainly never heard, is a most hopeless aberration of criticism. Wisdom, understanding, knowledge are then fused together into that very special form of life-giving knowledge with
which the term " Gnosis " has been connected. The writer's conception of Gnosis is fundamentally the same as that of
the later Gnostics. It was brought to men by the Word ; but
the earlier Wisdom is not entirely superseded. In the Wisdom of Solomon she is a holy Spirit ; and in the Odes
she continues to be the Spirit of the Lord. But since under
one aspect wisdom is Gnosis, and the Word is also " the
Spirit of the Lord," there is an indefiniteness in the character ization which is evidence of early date. Further evidence of this is the fact that the name of the Word has not yet been specialized. Just as in Greek there are two terms rhema and logos, both meaning word, of which the latter became specialized as the title of the divine Word, so also in Syriac. One of these always signifies the written or spoken word, the other in Christian writings is invariably used to designate the personified Word, the Logos. But whereas in some of the Odes the second of these terms is found as the designation of the Word, in others the first is found. Similarly, as Harris pointed out, in Syriac translations of the prophetic books of the Old Testament the two terms are employed indis
criminately. The immense difference between the comparatively simple yet admirable theosophy of these Odes and the complex Catholic Christianity of the second century, with
its large admixture of Judaic elements and its doctrine of an expiatory sacrifice, is sufficient proof that the two are
separated by a considerable interval of time. In respect of religious thought the Odes are very much nearer to the Wisdom literature than they are to Ignatius. We may not improperly term them Christian, but their Christianity is of
a primitive type. It is Christianity just emerging from a HellelriZScT form of Judaism. There were contemporary Gentile mystics who held very similar opinions and had



118 THE ODES OF SOLOMON
set up an ethical standard quite as high; 1 but Pagan Gnosticism was so inextricably bound up with the old polytheism that the time was ripe for the appearance of a new religion springing from another root.2 The Jews had
been able to suppress all their gods except one. It is well known that some Christian Gnostics tried even to depose Jehovah. Although they did not succeed in that, the Jewish god was denationalized. The men who propagated the doctrines of the Odes of Solomon had indeed no idea that
they were the pioneers of a new religion, and of course it was not Christianity as we know it. They still considered themselves Jews, and they had in view two aims of para mount importance : the supersession of Jewish legalism and
the overthrow of polytheism. It is a pity, but it was in evitable, that their highly spiritualized religion could not pre serve its pristine purity. Popularization and the exigencies of competition with rival cults necessarily brought on de terioration.
1 Evidenco of this will be found in Roitzenstein's Poimandres.
1 The characterization of the first-century Gnostic Christianity as
a new religion is not inconsistent with tho opinion that the worship
of a sacrificed JesuH was a consequence of the emergence of the
secret cult of an ancient Palestinian god Joshua. Tho worship of
Joshua was not, and would not by itself have become, Christianity.



CHAPTER IV
THE DOGMA OF THE INCAENATION
1. Jewish Gnostic Communities in the First Century
The theosophical speculation which resulted from the in teraction of Greek philosophy and Jewish religion expressed itself in a number of systems which, having a few basic principles in common, exhibited, after the necessary period of development, considerable variety in detail. The questions which agitated men's minds were such as these : How can matter have been created, or in any way moulded, by a spiritual Being ? How is it possible for men to know, or have any relationship with, an invisible, immaterial God ? How is the existence of evil to be reconciled with the goodness
of God ? If man is not a spiritual being how can he be in any
sense immortal ? If he is a spiritual being, why is he sinful ? How can he extricate himself from the death of sin and attain to the immortality which pure spirit alone can be
expected to enjoy ? If God is perfectly just, how can any man escape punishment ? We have seen how one very early community attempted to answer some of these questions ; but, as the Odes of Solomon are from their purpose and
character an expression of the emotional side of the religion of the community, there may have been a more speculative
side to it of which they furnish no information. On the
other hand, it is likely that in certain groups there was more interest taken in the purely religious problems of the relationship between God and man and the means of sal vation than in the cosmological speculations which exercised the minds of those to whom the name Gnostic has been particularly applied. We know a good deal concerning these from Christian writers of the second century and later ; but
if there were communities of the former type which became merged into the Christian Church in the course of the first
119



120 THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION
century, we might easily not have learnt anything about them.1 The fortunate accident of the preservation and discovery of the Odes of Solomon has given us information
about one community of its type ; but is it likely that that
was the only one ? A sect whose proselytizing zeal was such as we have seen that of the community O to have been must surely, like the Essenes, have been represented in several
places. It is even probable that in a period during which there was in process so active a fermentation of religious
thought among Jews of the Dispersion communities of a somewhat similar character would have come more or less independently into existence. Travelling Jews would spread abroad current ideas apart from purposive propa ganda. According to the Acts of the Apostles, Paul, when he came
to Puteoli on his way to Rome, found " brethren " there.
If that is correct it means that there was a Christian community of some kind at Puteoli ; but there is no record of its foundation. There was also a church at Rome, since
we are told that " brethren " went out from Rome to meet Paul. There is independent evidence in this case, for Onufrius says that Clement, who succeeded Cletus as head of the Roman church, was appointed in the year 68. The head before Cletus was Linus, and according to Epiphanius each of these men held office for twelve years ; so that the church was in existence as early as the year 45. And, since Linus is not said to have been the founder of it, the date of its origin is unknown. The probability is that it had been in existence for a good while before Linus became the head of it, because the comparatively late tradition that the church had been founded by Peter and Paul proves that all record of its foundation had been lost. The character of the community at Rome is not certainly known, but there is some evidence that it was Judaic and Messianic, which would explain the fact that the Hellenistic Paul appears to have
1 Why does the Acts of the Apostles not mention the Essenes and
Therapeuts, who were numerous and important ? Who on the other
hand were the " saints " found by Peter at Lydda and the " disciples "
discovered by Paul in various places ? It may be suspected that the
writer was too politic to give definite information.



THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION 121
had no relations with it.1 There is evidence however that there was a community of Hellenistic Jews in Rome in the first century. We know more about the community at
Corinth. That community was also not founded by Paul;
there is in Acts no hint of it. But when Paul came to Corinth
he attached himself to a " synagogue," lodging close by, no
doubt for the convenience of attending it. In this synagogue, which contained Greeks as well as Jews, Paul preached
regularly with acceptance for many months. It does not
follow that because the place is named a synagogue it was the meeting-place of orthodox Jews. Jewish Gnostics named their meeting-places synagogues. The Marcionites
had " synagogues " ; and Irenaeus writes of " all the synagogues of the heretics." The synagogue in which Paul preached at Corinth cannot have been a synagogue of orthodox Jews, because we are told in Acts that Paul, after preaching there for several weeks, was constrained by the
Word (Logos) to address " the Jews," implying that in some
sense the members of the synagogue were not " Jews." These Jews immediately opposed themselves and blasphemed.
But when Crispus, a ruler of the synagogue, " believed with all his house," he was apparently able to remain ruler. We must infer that, while the doctrine preached by Paul differed in some respects from that previously held, it cannot have
been in essential points opposed to it. In particular it is
certain that the community was not Judaic ; if it had been, seeing that Paul preached the abrogation of the Mosaic
Law, the members, like " the Jews " whom he afterwards addressed, would have opposed themselves and blasphemed.
But no opposition whatever in the " synagogue " is recorded. When Paul had been preaching for eighteen months, Sosthenes, either joint ruler with Crispus or his successor, was so far a sympathizer with Paul that he was brought together with Paul before the judgment seat of Gallio by the
Jews and even beaten by them there. I have given reasons elsewhere 2 for believing that it is this Sosthenes whose name
1 Several critics of the New Testament have concluded that the
words " in Rome " in Rom. i, 7, are not original.

122 THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION
is coupled with that of Paul in the superscription to the First
Epistle to the Corinthians. In that Epistle it is implied that
Paul was not the founder of the Corinthian church, but that he had been a visitor to one already constituted. For he
says (ii, 1) : "I, brethren, when I came unto you." And
when the Epistle was written the community had been in existence sufficiently long for many of its original members
to be dead. As we read in xi, 30, " not a few sleep." The Epistle is composite, and chapter viii, 1-4, is probably a
portion of the Epistle of Sosthenes. From those verses it can be inferred that the community was Gnostic. For it .is
there written : " Now concerning things sacrificed to idols : We know that we all have knowledge [Gnosis], and we know that no idol is anything in the world." The writer accordingly sees no intrinsic harm in eating meat sacrificed to idols, but he thinks that for the sake of others who have not Gnosis
and believe it to be sinful it is better to refrain. It is well known that Gnostics did in fact eat such meat without compunction on the very ground stated by this writer. The
" knowledge " in question was not common knowledge, because other Christians believed that the Pagan deities were
daemons. The Naassenes, who also had " knowledge," could without scruple participate in the rites of Pagan Saviour-cults.
A later editor, who disapproved of the reasoning, supplies an antidote by a very uncompromising condemnation of the practice in x, 19-21.
We are, then, entitled to conclude that the " synagogue " found by Paul at Corinth was a congregation of Hellenistic Jews and Greeks ; that its religious belief may be described as Gnostic ; and that it had been in existence for a con
siderable time when Paul came to it. It was in fact a con gregation of the same type as the community O ; and there is no reason to suppose that it was not in existence in the
earliest years of the first century. The doctrine taught in all these communities of Hellenistic Jews must at first have been very much the same, embodying certain religious ideas
which were current in the period of their inception. But as time went on the primitive doctrine was elaborated in
various directions and degrees through the influence of



THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION 123
Platonism, Stoicism, oriental Gnosticism, and the neigh
bouring Mystery Religions. In some of the communities, no doubt, but little development occurred and the doctrine remained comparatively simple. The dogmatic history of the others is a blank until, having become definitely heretical, they attracted the hostile attention of Christian writers late
in the second century. But it is not impossible to extract from the information given some knowledge of the earlier doctrine.
2. The Naassenes, Peratai, and Sethians
The sect of the Naassenes may have originated in the last pre-Christian century. Undoubtedly it was in existence very early in the first century. For Hippolytus says that the Naassenes were the first Gnostics, anterior therefore to the Simonians. Some early Christian writers, who could not admit that Gnosticism was pre-Christian, affirmed that the semi-mythical Simon Magus was the father of heresy. This belief, though erroneous, really proves that Gnosticism was not an offshoot from Christianity, because Simon is said to have been a contemporary of the first Apostles ; and from
the account of him in Acts, distorted as it is, his original independence of, and indeed priority to, the Christian
Apostles is evident. It is said (Acts viii, 11) that the people
of Samaria gave heed to him because " for a long time " he had amazed them with his sorceries. From the in formation we have it can be inferred that the Simonian Gnosticism existed in Samaria before the year 30, and that
for some time it was a rival to Christianity. Hence the virulence with which Simon was attacked by early Christian writers. We can learn from a remark let fall by Jerome that
Docetism is at least as old as Christianity. " The blood of
Christ," he wrote,1 " was still fresh in Judaea when his body
was called a phantasm." But if Docetism existed as early as that, nothing hinders our supposing that it had existed even earlier. Reitzenstein has recognized the fact that the oldest identifiable Naassene document exhibits no trace of Christian influence. He characterizes its doctrine as Pagan ;
1 Adv. Luciferum, 23.



124 THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION
and the " refutation " of Hippolytus consists in a demon stration of its non-Christian origin. Exception may, however,
be taken to the application of the term " Pagan " to the Naassene doctrine, for the name of the sect proves that it was Jewish, and, although there are striking resemblances between its doctrine and that of the Hermetic literature, its monotheism was of Jewish origin and it had some affinity
with Philo. All three doctrines were moulded to a greater or less degree by religious ideas which must have been prevalent before the commencement of the Christian era. The Naassenes themselves claimed to be the only genuine Christians.
It is evident from the account which Hippolytus gives of the doctrines of the Naassenes that the writings from which he derived his information had been produced over a con siderable period of time, during which development was taking place ; for some of his statements are inconsistent with one another. He himself was not sufficiently critical to place the books with which he was acquainted in their proper chronological order, or to detect later insertions.
Nevertheless it is possible from the information he gives to
get some idea of the probable course of development and in particular to extract the fundamental, which must be the primitive, doctrine, though not quite perhaps in its original simple form. The God of the Naassenes is not a person, though he is incidentally called the Father. He is said to be without shape,
incomprehensible, ineffable. He is, in fact, the Most High of the Odes of Solomon, become even more indefinite and
remote. He is a limitless Spirit of whom —or rather of which
—nothing can be predicated except that he may be named
" the Good." This designation was not applied in the sense in which moral goodness can be ascribed to a person, for the Greek word used is in the neuter (to agathon). Probably with
a knowledge of the Platonic doctrine of " ideas," the Naassenes thought of God as the abstract quality of goodness, conceived as having a real existence. Everything good proceeds from him, but he himself is inactive ; just as the
Most High of the Odes operates through the Word. In the



THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION 125
Wisdom books God is said to have created the world by his Wisdom. The Naassenes appear not to have used this name ; they substituted for it a term borrowed from Greek
philosophy —Nous, the Mind of God. And since the Mind of God cannot well be imagined as separable from him, they gave to the divine Spirit Wisdom, which in the Wisdom of
Solomon penetrates all things, the name Psyche (soul). Even
stones, they said, possess soul. They were probably ac quainted with the Stoic conception of the world-soul, but
also they were Jews, well versed in the Old Testament, and their Nous and Psyche seem to reproduce the two aspects
of Wisdom. The Naassene argument that stones must possess soul because they are capable of growth is akin to the statement in the Wisdom of Solomon that Wisdom
reneweth all things ; and the opinion that " all things
yearn for Psyche " is comparable with the Jewish writer's eulogy of Wisdom. The Psyche of the Naassene Hymn is clearly the Sophia of the later Gnostics. Also in that Hymn
it is Psyche who differentiates the primordial " chaos "
formless matter —into various objects, working out the
" law " which was implicit in Nous. Hence Nous, as in ventive, and Psyche, as operative, complete the creative Wisdom of God. Simon of Gitta1 made the same division, but he named the constructive or purposive Mind Epinoia. The germ of the distinction is perhaps to be seen in the
Odist's use of the terms " Thought " and " Will " of God. The Father was named by the Naassenes Adamas and
Anthropos (Man). The Platonic doctrine of " ideas " may
have contributed to the application of the second of these names. The highest metaphysical entity was perhaps
regarded as the heavenly " idea " of the highest material
entity. But it is doubtful whether that is the complete explanation. The notion of a first divine man is traceable
1 This Simon was confounded by early Christian writers with the
Simon of the Simonian Gnostics under the title Simon Magus. The
latter Simon —or Semon —was a divine being, as is proved by his
being paired with Helene (Selene) —Luna (the Moon) in the Recog
nitions —who is definitely named Sophia and has some of the charac
teristics of Isis. See also J. M. Robertson, The Jesus Problem,
Appendix B. Simon of Gitta affirmed the immobility of the highest
God, naming him 6 iorms (stans = the stationary one).



126 THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION
to the Assyrians (Babylonians), by whom he was named
Oannes and believed to have issued from the sea. In the Naassene book it is said that the Assyrians in worshipping Oannes were ignorantly worshipping Anthropos.1 The
name " Adamas " was evidently suggested by " Adam " ; and in the doctrine of some other Gnostics Adam was a manifestation of the Christ. The fact that Philo made a distinction between the heavenly and the earthly Adam and equated the former with Nous points to some early lore respecting a primal divine man. There is plainly some connection between Philo's view and that of the Naassenes.
In the Hermetic Poimandres also we read of a primal
"god-man " who descended. According to Reitzenstein an anthropos-doctrine took root in Egypt at about the beginning
of the Christian era. It is possible that the final syllable as was appended to Adam to identify the name with the Greek word adamas, which means unconquerable, also diamond. The necessary link between the immobile divine Spirit and the material world was found by the Naassenes, as by the Odist, in the Word, who, as the Son of Anthropos, is
termed " Son of Man," but there is no connection between this Son of Man and the apocalyptic. Although named the
Son, he is a " formless, invisible, immaterial, and ineffable
Spirit "—in other words, a spiritual emanation from the Father. As in the Odes of Solomon, the Holy Spirit is not
absolutely separable from the Father and the Son. They are the divine Spirit and essentially a unity. Hippolytus
quotes : " For Spirit, they say, is God. . . . And the Spirit is there wherever the Father is named, and the Son born
there out of the Father." It was shown previously that in the doctrine of the Odes of Solomon the Word is the Father
in his relation to men. The doctrine of the Naassenes was similar ; for by means of the Word men are brought into relationship with God and obtain knowledge of him. Men are said to become pneumatic through the descent into them of the spiritual Son of Man. Referring to statues of Hermes,
1 There may be a connection between the Babylonian fable of
Oannes and the imagery of 2 Esdras xiii, in which the Messiah " in
the likeness of a man " conies up " from the midst of the sea."



THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION -^
whom they identified with their Logos, the Naassene writer
says, " These statues are images of the primordial Anthropos
and of the re-born spiritual man who is in all respects of the same essence as that Anthropos." The re-born spiritual man is, however, the Son of Man. For, after explaining the Eleusinian Mystery as symbolizing the pneumatic generation (birth), the heavenly one, the one above, the writer continues,
" because we, the pneumatic people, came from above flowing down from Adamas."
The incarnate Son is termed " the Christ " ; and in the Naassene doctrine on this subject we have verification of the opinion, expressed in the previous chapter, that when
the Odist wrote that the Word " was reckoned like myself," his meaning was that the Word took the form of men by
entering into them. For the Naassene Logos was also form less and extra-spatial, but when as Christ he becomes incarnate in a man he has to that extent spatial limitation.
In a passage quoted by Hippolytus we read, " This is the Christ, the Son of Man, who is fashioned from the formless Logos in all who are born." Inferably the Naassenes at a certain stage in the development of their system introduced a nominal distinction between the formless Logos and the
incarnate Christ. It does not, however, appear that the Christ who descends is thereby separated from the Father.
In fact, the Son himself is occasionally named both
Anthropos and Adamas. In one passage the Naassene conception of the relation between God and the spiritual man is expressed in the enunciation of the three fundamental existences : the highest Anthropos, the mortal man below,
and the Jordan which flows to the parts above. But this Jordan, it is explained, is the male-female Anthropos who is in all. The Son of Man appears thus to be conceived as an upward-flowing spiritual stream connecting men with God. The language all through is highly figurative, and expressions
such as " male-female " in the quoted passage must not be
taken literally. Elsewhere it is said, " his form no one knows." The idea may be that Anthropos is universal Mother as well as universal Father. That, perhaps, is why
there was no separate " Virgin Mother " in the Naassene



28 THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION
X theosophy. It is remarkable how these people took all
myths and sublimated them. To the literal-minded Hippolytus they seemed to be lunatics. After the manner of Gnostics generally, they extracted from the books they used hidden meanings by symbolic interpretation, dealing with the Old Testament precisely as they dealt with Homer.
For example, they explained Isa. xxviii, 16— " I will lay a
precious stone [adamas] in the foundations of Zion "—as
signifying the insertion of Adamas into the human frame. Then, citing Homer, the writer says that the inner man who fell down from the primordial Adamas above is contained within the body as within a wall and palisade.1 The Naassenes had no solution of the problem of the existence of evil other than that which is implied in the
Wisdom of Solomon. Evil, they supposed, is a quality
inherent in matter. They denied that anything but good could proceed from God, so that probably in their earliest
doctrine primordial matter, " the chaos," was uncreated, as is the case in the oldest doctrine of the Peratai ; later, how
ever, this opinion was altered. In order to exonerate God from the charge of having created anything evil, they adopted the theory that man had been spontaneously produced from
the earth. This is carnal or " choic " man, who at first lay motionless like a statue until the sentient and emotional soul (psyche) was introduced into him so that he might be disciplined and perfected by suffering. He was at that time ignorant of God and had no vision of higher things. He was idolatrous and vicious. His soul, though divine in origin, was prevented from rising by the matter to which
it was bound. Spirit —Adamas, as the Son of Man—then descended from above and, becoming united with the soul, strove to liberate it. He too is thus exposed to the con tamination of matter and is held down and tortured in his prison of flesh. By this we must understand the discipline through suffering of the spiritual nature. But not all men are amenable to discipline. The Christ, as we read in a passage quoted above, is fashioned in all who are born.
But men can be separated into two classes —the pneumatic
II., Bk. IV, 350 and elsewhere.



THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION 129
and the psychic. In the former spirit prevails over matter
and liberates the soul. In the latter the Christ is put to death. The writer, symbolically applying a Phrygian
dogma, says that the Christ in carnal men is " a corpse
dug down into the body as if into a monument and tomb." But a psychic man is capable of becoming pneumatic, and this conversion the Naassenes called resurrection from the dead, and apparently thought of it even as a metaphorical ascension into Heaven by means of the upward-flowing spiritual Jordan. For, they said, those who are spiritually re-born out of carnal bodies are dead men who come forth from their tombs.
This also, they say, is the ascension which takes place
through the gate of the heavens, through which all who do not enter remain dead.1
But it was of course the spiritual Christ in the mortal body
who rose and ascended. Hence the words of the Psalm
" Lift up your heads, O ye gates . . . and the king of glory
shall come in "—are explained as a description of the entry into Heaven of Adamas, the divine Spirit which had been brought from death to life in the spiritual regeneration of a man. The later Gnostics dealt with the New Testament on the same principles as they did with the Old, adapting the Gospel story to their doctrine by allegorical interpreta
tion. To what extent they accepted it as literally true it is impossible to say. With all their fine intellect and highsoaring speculation, Gnostics were not critical in the modern sense. Marcion, however, denied that Jesus had been
" born " ; and Gnostics of the type of the Naassenes made no apparent distinction between the Christian story and the fables of the Pagans. There is no evidence of knowledge of a Gospel in the oldest identifiable Naassene document ; but
in one of their later writings, following the quotation " I
am the true gate," it is said :
But he who spoke this was the perfect Anthropos who
was fashioned from the formless one above. The Phrygians
tell of this same Man and call him Papa, because he gave

rest * to all things which before his appearance had been
moving in a disorderly and discordant manner.2
Again it is said that " the hidden mystery "—presumably
Gnosis — " is the water which Jesus at that beautiful wedding
changed and made into wine." But the writer no less
confidently identifies the " mystery " with a cup of wine mentioned in a poem by Anacreon. And the virgin who conceived and bore a holy son, whether the virgin of Isaiah or the virgin of the Mysteries, is, it is said, a type of the spiritual generation of the pneumatic people. The holy son, by whatever name in different places he is known, is not an individual person, but the universal Christ, the pneuma which came down from Adamas and lives in every spiritual man. Actually in this symbolism there is no
" virgin " involved. The " virgin birth," whether Christian
or Pagan, symbolizes a process. In the Hermetic literature
also Isis is said to mean " generation." The Naassenes, like other Gnostics, named the body Egypt and took the Exodus to be a symbol of the delivery of the spiritual man from the carnal nature. We may see that the doctrine of the Naassenes, although
it elaborated some of the ideas and introduced new nomen clature, is in its origin essentially the same metaphysical doctrine which we found in the Odes of Solomon. We have
the incomprehensible, ineffable Father, who has become even more indefinite through the practical substitution for him of Nous, the divine Mind. We have the Word, named also the Christ, who, being one with the Father and issuing from him, becomes incarnate in spiritual men, not rejecting their souls but humbling himself to the contamination of flesh, and, being confined within the frame of the body,
" was reckoned like myself that I might put him on,"
bringing also to men the saving knowledge of a God other
wise unknown. We have also the " virgin birth " of the
pneumatic people, though the " virgin " has been reduced to a symbol. Finally we have the bringing of the dead

* It is evident from this quotation that the writer was applying
to the Gospel narrative a doctrine previously existing.



THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION 131
out of Sheol by the power of the Word. The writer
illustrates allegorically his doctrine of " resurrection " by applying some passages of Homer in which Hermes is taken to represent the Logos ; citing one of these 1 he
says that the " squeaking ghosts " in Hades followed the Logos. But obviously, no more than the Odist did he believe that the Logos had literally gone down into Hades. Connected with the Naassenes were the Peratai. Hippolytus says that the sect had been long in existence but that its doctrines were little known. These, as Hippolytus presents them, are much elaborated, being contained in
many books, no doubt produced at different dates. It is, however, possible to extract from the medley some of the
earlier doctrine, which, if primitive, is not so old as that of
the Naassenes. That notwithstanding, it is, as Hippolytus
avers, of non-Christian origin. At the head of all is the
motionless, inactive Father —the Unborn and the absolute Good. There is also the uncreated hyle, primordial matter. Between the Father and the hyle, connecting the one with the other, is the Son, the Logos, whom the Peratai, like the Naassenes, styled the Self-born. The Logos receives from
the Father " ideas " of all things and impresses them upon the hyle, thus creating the multiform cosmos. Later this doctrine was modified; the cosmos was then believed to have emanated from the stars and to be subject accordingly to destiny (heimarmene), from which men could be liberated
only by Gnosis. A third, apparently still later, opinion was that the Archon, Demiurgus, who was identified with the god of the Jews, took some of the shapes which had been scattered like seeds by the Logos and so brought forth
children of his own. An analogous opinion is found in the
Hermetic literature, and there also it seems not to be primitive. According to the earlier doctrine everyone is potentially redeemable through having received the seed which was sown by the Logos. The seed sown by the Logos appears in this doctrine to have replaced the Logos himself, who in the doctrine of some other Gnostics is the seed
1 Od. xxiv, 6 S.



132 THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION
sown by the Father. The condition of salvation is the
following :
If anyone masters the things of this world and under
stands that he is a paternal shape brought down from above
and embodied, he becomes of the same nature as the Father
who is in the heavens, and he goes back and is wholly at home there.
It appears that in the primitive doctrine the Logos was an undefined Spirit, connecting the cosmos with the Father, bringing down the spiritual part of men, and conveying
back the spirits of those who have acquired Gnosis. But in the later doctrine the Logos becomes more definitely unified, and as such is believed to have appeared upon earth in the form of Cain and of Esau, also as Joseph the son of Jacob. The latter appearance, according to Hippolytus, was said to have occurred in the days of Herod. We may infer that
it was regarded as a reappearance, and it is probable that this duplicated appearance of Joseph was a comparatively
late idea. It is not said that the Peratai named their Logos Christ.
The system of the Sethians, as described —not at all
methodically —by Hippolytus, is so fantastic a mixture of
allegory and metaphysical philosophy that it is not easily intelligible. These Gnostics took some pains by the intro
duction of different terminology to make it more clear that their divine entities were not persons. When this is realized the affinity of their system to those of the Naassenes and Peratai becomes apparent. Thus, avoiding the term Father, they named the highest principle of their cosmogony
" Light." Their system is thereby linked with the theo
sophy of the Wisdom of Solomon and the Odes. For in
the former Wisdom is said to be " an effulgence from ever
lasting Light." And in the latter such phrases as " the
mouth of the Lord is the door of his light," " Light dawned from the Word which was beforetime in him [the Father],"
are frequent. Direct dependence need not be assumed. The Odist and the Sethians were under the influence of
contemporary thought. In the Hermetic literature also the



THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION 133
highest existences were named " Light " and " Life." The
uncreated hyle was termed by the Sethians "a dark and terrible water." Between the Light and the water extended Pneuma. The writer says that Pneuma must not be thought
of as " breath " or " air " ; it is far more tenuous than these
and may be compared rather to " odour." In the beginning, he says, rays from the Light, mingled with Pneuma, pene
trated the water, and from the " powers " inherent in these, forms of objects were generated by the clashing and commotion caused by them in the foaming water. Light and Pneuma are thus entangled in the dark water and so become the spiritual part of men, who are generated in it
and from it. This spiritual part of men is termed " Nous." Nous longs to reascend to the Light and the Pneuma from whence it came, but the darkness strives to retain it.1 Logos accordingly descends for its liberation. Nous is represented as being mingled with matter bike bits of iron with earth, so that the spiritual part of pneumatic men is attracted to
Logos as to a magnet :
Thus the power of the Light [Nous] which is mingled with
the water takes through instruction and teaching its own
place and hastens to the Logos which came down from above
in the form of a slave, and with the Logos it becomes Logos
there where Logos is even more readily than iron clings to a magnet.
The Sethian Nous is evidently the Naassene Psyche, and is thus connected with Sophia who is both Wisdom and the human soul. Philo ascribes this same function of the liberation of the soul to the higher spiritual beings whom he names angels, daemons, and logoi. According to Philo the
soul in some men is so deeply sunk in matter that it can never be liberated. The Gnostic view was of course the same. The later Gnostic fable of the fall of Sophia and her rescue by the Christ who descends for that purpose is evidently an allegorizing of the liberation of WisdomNous-Psyche by the Logos, which is the same thing as the
1 Cp. Jn., i, 5, of which a more correct translation probably is :
" The light shineth in the darkness and the darkness mastered it
not."



134 THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION
salvation of the human soul. , According to Irenaeus
(I,
xxx,
3)
the Ophites taught that Sophia descended into the primeval water, just as Nous does in the system of the Sethians. Gnostic doctrine was extremely plastic; the same
themes are found in difi'erent forms and in connection with different names. The cosmological system of these Gnostics
is
obviously dualistic; but the dualism
is
not oriental. The antithesis
is
between primordial uncreated matter and spirit,
not, in the earliest form of the doctrine, between God and
a
malign creator. The Jewish dualism was Hellenistic. It
was pushed to an extreme in the Ethics of the Neo-Pyt goreans, with whom the Essenes and the Therapeuts were intellectually related. There
is
affinity between the Sethian cosmogony and that
of Poimamlres. The simile of “ a slave ” may be con nected with
a
statement in the same book
(I,
14) to the
efl'ect that the “ god-man ” who descended into the'prim
ordial matter became “
a
slave subject to fate.” The
expression “ form of
a
slave ” must be figurative, because the Sethian Logos was certame not
a
man. The oldest Gnostic systems in their simplest discoverable form are not new creations; they are growths whose roots can be seen in the Wisdom
of
Solomon and whose stem
is
Hellenistic Jewish religious and cosmological speculation
with secretions of foreign and particularly Egyptian origin. Some Christian writers have thought to explain Gnosticism
from the influence of the teaching of Paul. The affinity
of Paulinism to Gnosticism
is
a fact; but the latter cannot be derived from the former. As Bousset
1
judiciously observed :
It can hardly be supposed that the few, and in their termin
ology not easily comprehensible, dissertations of Paul which
are to be found scattered in his Epistles could have so
powerful an influence upon the most diverse Gnostic systems.
Doubtless the writer knew that his readers would comprehend him, whence
it
follows that his Gnostic ter minology must already have been well known. The Simonian Gnosticism was a kindred growth. The Simon

of Acts was not a man; he was “ that power of God which
is called Great ” (viii, 10)—in other words, the Logos of the
Simonian Gnostics; and like the Logos of the Naassenes,
he was the liberator of the imprisoned soul, Helene, whom' the Christian writers absurdly describe as his female .com panion. These writers probably m'munderstood a Simonian
allegory. Justin says that nearly all the Samaritans “ wor
shipped ” Simon.
Since Philo named the rational soul “ Nous,” and held
it to have been stamped like a coin from the divine and invisible Spirit, we are carried back to a very early date for
the inception of the system of the Sethians. Bousset 1 infers from references to predecessors in the works of Philo that the topics he treats had for some time been subjects of discussion in the schools at Alexandria. He also shows that
several of the theories of Philo which have been traced back to Greek philosophers had undergone modification which is explicable only on the supposition that they had come to him through earlier Jewish thinkers. There is textual evidence that the modifications were not all made by Philo
himself.s For example, Philo appears to have been
acquainted with an interpretation of the birth of Cain as
the creation of the world through the action of Nous (Adam) upon matter (Eve); he, however, preferred a
different interpretation.a The suggested interpretation doubtless corresponds with an Egyptian belief that the
universe is the result of a metaphysical copulation of a divine ~ creator with nature (physis), by which is meant primordial
matter. The Sethians regarded the penetration of the
water by the ray as an “ impregnation.” Elsewhere
Bousset observes that Philo cannot be explained from Greek and Jewish ideas alone; there must, he says, have been a third and important factor the source of which is at present a problem. Reitzenstein has shown that the third factor
was Helleno-Egyptian theosophy; and in the light of the

evidence adduced by him we may legitimately infer the influence of this theosophy upon the early Jewish Gnostics.
3. The Clementines
The Gnostics were endeavouring to solve within the frame of religion the problems which the Stoics were trying to solve in philosophy ; and they were not likely to be more successful. They built up with words and names a structure of fine appearance, in which people of less imagination
would see a solidity it did not possess. Their systems, before they became over-elaborated, were no doubt helpful and adapted to the mentality of many religious thinkers of their day ; but it is certain that men of inferior intelligence cannot have comprehended the deeper significance of the symbolic language of the Gnostic writers. However concrete the imagery employed by those writers, they probably knew that fundamentally the names they used, such as Nous, Aletheia, Epinoia, and Sophia, were not the names of
persons in any definite sense of the term personality. It was only by ascribing some kind of substantiality to an abstract quality that they could conceive and formulate their cosmological and soteriological theories. The average member of a community would be decidedly more apt to materialize; and the constant use of certain names must by degrees have led to the growth of a belief that corre sponding persons had in some manner and place a real
existence. Thus it is likely that for many Gnostic Christians the Logos and Sophia gradually became as real as Isis, Dionysus, and Hermes were for the Pagans. Probably the more speculative Gnostic groups never became popular ; but even in them we can detect a tendency
towards individualization. Thus the Peratai had advanced from the conception of the universal incarnation of an impersonal Logos to that of a special incarnation in definite historical, or quasi-historical, persons : Cain, Esau, Joseph,
and probably Moses. In communities whose less elaborated
doctrine could make a popular appeal, the process of individualization must have advanced a great deal farther. What, for example, would the average Pagan convert to the



THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION 137
community O make of the metaphysical doctrine of the incarnation of the Logos ? Accustomed as he had been to
the worship of a deity who was believed to have appeared upon earth in human shape, would he not be inclined to
think of a Christ, the son of God, who had " appeared " to men, as one who had, not metaphorically, but literally at some time appeared, converting the general into a particular incarnation ? Early in the Christian era the conception of isolated appearances of the Christ was beginning to be rather widely
held; for it is found in documents which were afterwards taken over by the Christians. There existed at that time a Gnostic Christianity, but no established Christian dogma.
Various doctrines were competing with one another. Evid ence of this can be found in the Clementine Recognitions, which, granting that the book assumed its existing form towards the middle of the second century, comprises sections of much earlier date. The underlying document was Gnostic in character, but its Gnosticism appears to have
been of a comparatively conservative Jewish type. In the related Homilies the supreme God, held to be both just and good, is not, strictly speaking, Yahveh, but the universal God. The ruler of this world is the devil ; not precisely the Christian devil, but rather a subordinate power serving the purposes of God in an imperfect world. That is a Jewish
view of Satan which is found in Job i, 6 ff., where he is not a daemon or the adversary of God. He is one of the
" sons of God " and submissive to the divine will.1 The relationship of the Homilies and the Recognitions to one another is obscure; but there was evidently an earlier literature which is common to both. The theosophic doctrine of the Recognitions differs from the later more specifically Gnostic doctrine in making the supreme Being
the Creator, and in abolishing those qualities of Yahveh which offended Marcion and other Gnostics by roundly asserting that all statements in the Old Testament derogatory of God are false. Obviously the underlying document was

translated " adversary " is satan.
K— G.C.



138 THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION
not Catholic ; and in neither the Homilies nor the Recognitions
ia there any trace of the dogma of a vicarious sacrifice. In opposition to the devil as the king of the present aeon is
set the Christ as the king of the perfect aeon to come. But
this king is not Jesus ; he is a pre-existent Christ—evidently the outcome of speculation analogous to that which created the Gnostic Christ-Logos. The doctrine of the Odes of Solomon that the Word is an
emanation from God which becomes incarnate in men is found in the Recognitions. But whereas apparently in the former the Word has his dwelling-place in spiritual men only, in the latter God has breathed his divine spirit into all men ; and this spirit is the Christ, the only-begotten. Con sequently men are not classified as spiritual and carnal, but according to the degree in which they are taught and guided by the Christ within them. But, as in the Odes, through union with the Son men become sons of God by adoption.1 The spiritual Christ is likened to an odour.
A prominent feature of the preaching of Peter in these
two books is " the true Prophet " or " the Prophet of the truth." There must in the first century have been a
literature treating this theme. In the Recognitions we find inconsistent opinions as to the nature of the Prophet which can be explained most satisfactorily by supposing that they have been derived from different documents presenting stages in the development of the doctrine. The incon sistencies are important because they exhibit a progressive transition from the Logos doctrine of the Odes of Solomon
to the later specialized dogma of the Incarnation. Accord
ing to one —presumably the earliest opinion —the true Prophet is the Christ in men. As in the Odes, it is through the Christ that men obtain Gnosis. Men cannot, says Peter, discover the nature of God by their intellect ; all that can or need be known of God can be learnt from the true Prophet

—sc. the Christ within them —in other words, by intuition.
The doctrine is pre-Christian in the sense that it is not
founded upon the person or the teaching of Jesus. It is quite clear from the terms of the passage previously quoted
from Bk. VIII that Peter is not thinking of the teaching of any particular person, since he says that even though the true Prophet be not rightly questioned he is yet everywhere and within the minds of all men. We find in this literature a progressive limitation of the indwelling Christ first to the pious in general and later to a few exceptional persons. We have in the Recognitions the two statements that the true Prophet has traversed the centuries from the beginning of the world, and that the Christ through all generations has been present with the pious.1 We are then led on to the statement found elsewhere, but more explicitly in the Homilies, that the true Prophet had manifested himself at different times to certain men of exceptional piety, mention being made of Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses. We may refer this development, in part at least, to the penetration into Greece and Egypt of the oriental idea that a certain god had descended in the form of a man and then, after appeasing the earth, re-ascended into Heaven. Hermes, who was named king and saviour, is an example.
In a Gnostic work entitled Kore Kosmou (Pupil of the Cosmos) wickedness, it is said, had so gained the upper
hand on earth that the very elements—earth, air, fire, and
water —approached the throne of the Most High with complaints. Thereupon God sent as human beings to the earth Osiris and Isis, who, after founding temples and cult and establishing laws, re-ascended to Heaven.2 Horace must have been acquainted with ideas of this kind when,
in Ode I,
ii,
48, he hinted that in Augustus Hermes had
incarnated himself to bring order into the world. In these myths the incarnate god or Logos has predominantly the

quality of Saviour, but he appears also in Gnostic writings as prophet and teacher.
In Recog. I, 33, there is found a view of the nature of the Prophet inconsistent with the primitive one. Here the Prophet has become a divine being standing apart from men and making only occasional appearances. For it is said that he appeared to Abraham and gave information which the Patriarch had desired concerning the causes of
things.1 In one or two places the true Prophet is identified with Adam, the primal man (Anthropos), reminding us of the Christ Adamas, the Son of Man, in the system of the
Naassenes. For example, in I, 46, it is said that when man was created, since he was the son of God and the beginning of all, he was the first to be anointed by God with oil extracted from the tree of fife ; and in consequence of having been
so anointed he was called the Christ. In the Homilies generally the Prophet of the truth has become definitely a single person, the Jesus of the Gospels, but that this is the view of the redactor and not primitive appears from
an illuminating passage (II, 6) which is evidently a fragment
from one of the basic documents :
Now the Prophet of the truth is he who always knows all
things —things past as they were, things present as they
are, things future as they shall be; sinless, merciful, alone
entrusted with the declaration of the truth. Read, and
you will find that those [were deceived] who thought that
they had found the truth of themselves. For this is peculiar
to the Prophet, to declare the truth, even as it is peculiar to
the sun to bring the day. Wherefore, as many as have
ever desired to know the truth, but have not had the good
fortune to learn it from him, have not found it, but have died
seeking it.
Comparison with passages of similar import in the Recognitions raises a suspicion that the redactor has not reproduced the exact words of his source ; but he has left enough of the original form to show that the writer was not thinking of a single person. What we have is a
definition, and the term " Prophet " is general. Otherwise
1 In Philo also we find the statement that the Logos had appeared
to the Patriarchs.



THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION 141
we should not have had the word " always," and the verb would not have been in the present tense. Anyone writing of a particular person no longer alive would have said :
" The Prophet of the truth is [or was] he who knew all
things." And the persons who have died seeking the truth are all people, everywhere, and at all times, who have failed to learn it from the Prophet. The implication is that in all ages the Prophet could have been consulted. We are not restricted to inference in this matter, because there is
another passage (XVIII, 13) in which it is quite definitely
stated that the revelation of truth must —in the past—have
been given to all who were worthy ; and of course it could
have been given only by the Prophet of the truth :
" No one knows the Father but the Son and he to whom
the Son may wish to reveal him." The statement is correct ;
for he, being the Son from the beginning, was alone ap
pointed to give the revelation to those to whom he wishes
to give it. And thus the first man Adam must have heard
of him, and Enoch, who pleased [God], must have known
him ; and Noah, the righteous one, must have become
acquainted with him, and Abram his friend must have
understood, and Isaac must have perceived him ; and Jacob,
who wrestled with him, must have believed in him ; and the
revelation must have been given to all among the people
who were worthy.
The redactor quotes the text with the object of identifying
the Son with Jesus. But the text is a statement of Gnostic doctrine, and as such occasioned very keen controversy between Gnostics and Catholics.1 The latter endeavoured to explain away its implication that the true God could be
revealed only by the Son—the eternal, indwelling Christ. That is the original meaning of the passage as a whole, for the men named are said to have had direct knowledge of
God, .ind that by " revelation," which, according to the original doctrine of the Clementines, could have been given only by the Prophet of the truth, who is not a person apart, but within. There is a corresponding passage in

origin. No Catholic writer would have introduced it.



142 THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION
Recog. II, 47 which differs considerably from the one in the Homilies, but it is evident that both have been
founded upon an earlier document. In the opinion of Bousset 1 the most original and characteristic view of the Clementines is that the divine Prophet who manifested himself in Adam afterwards manifested himself personally in a series of other men. This is a view, and very likely an early view, of the Clementines; but the passage quoted
from Recog. IV, 9, proves that the original view was that the Christ has his dwelling in the minds of all men. We have been able to infer from the Recognitions that in
one, if not more, of the underlying documents quite excep tional honour was paid to Adam. The same document must have been one of the sources of the Homilies, for in
III, 18, the writer says that Adam had all knowledge —i.e.,
perfect Gnosis —and in 21 that he was the only true Prophet. The redactor works this into his own Christological doctrine by saying that Adam had the Holy Spirit of Christ, who had reappeared again and again in the world, introducing an
ambiguity. He seems to mean that it was the Holy Spirit that was in Christ which had reappeared, since he says that Adam had this Holy Spirit. The original writer cannot have used such an expression, his opinion having been that
Christ himself was the Spirit who had " appeared," not 'visibly, but in the men in whom he became incarnate. The redactor was undoubtedly dependent upon an earlier Gnostic
document, since it is extremely unlikely that a Christian writer, for whom Jesus was uniquely the Prophet of the truth, would of his own motion have described Adam as
" the only true Prophet." The doctrine of the repeated appearances of the Christ, above all in so superlative a degree as is here assigned to Adam, is surely not orthodox Catholic doctrine. The indications are that the doctrine is pre
Christian, Gnostic in its origin, and that it had been reached without any reference to the person or teaching of Jesus. Epiphanius gives the information that the Clementine Recognitions was current among the Gnostic Ebionites,
who named the Christ the " Prophet of the truth." And

THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION 143
their Christ was a Spirit invisible to men. There were two sects of Ebionites, as we learn from Origen. The fact is also clearly apparent from the confused and inconsistent accounts of their doctrines given by early Christian writers who confounded one of the sects with the other. According to Epiphanius, the sect originated very soon after the fall of Jerusalem ; but as he says, referring to the Gnostic Ebionites, that they used the same book which the Sampsaeans, Ossaeans, and Nasaraeans used, seeing also that these sects agreed with one another on certain important articles of belief, we must conclude that they did not come inde
pendently into existence. Rather is it probable that they were subdivisions of an earlier sect, which may therefore be supposed to have existed at least as early as the first half of the first century. Indeed, there is evidence that two of them at any rate were pre-Christian ; for Epiphanius
(Haer. xix, 6) says that " the Ossaeans and Nasaraeans
persisted until the coming of Christ," 1 also that the book
used by these sects named the Christ " the great King " ; so that it may have contained the doctrine of the Homilies that the Christ is to be the king of the future aeon. Epiphanius says further that the books of the Recognitions which the Ebionites possessed had been corrupted by them. The meaning of this statement simply is that the version
current among the Ebionites differed from his own. It is certainly possible that the Ebionites may have made alterations in the text or have interpolated it, but there is plenty of reason for believing that the extant version is an
altered and interpolated version of an earlier document. We have seen that in both the Homilies and the Recognitions the attempt has been made to obscure an earlier statement that the Christ had manifested himself in certain mythical
or semi-mythical Biblical characters. It is therefore very interesting to learn that the Sampsaean doctrine included
the repeated appearance of the Christ, and first of all in the body of Adam. Being a spirit, he had to clothe himself
1 Since, by the time of Epiphanius, Gnosticism had ceased to be
a serious danger to Catholic Christianity, he could venture to be less .
guarded than his predecessors and allow some facts previously
concealed to appear.



144 THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION
in some sort of body, either material or psychic, in order to be seen. We find among these sects some of the modifica tions of doctrine which were adverted to in connection with the Clementines. And this confirms the opinion that before the Clementines were written the different forms of doctrine were already current. Thus some of the Ebionites held that Adam was the Christ, others that the Christ endued with the body of Adam appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and that he had visited the earth on other occasions. We have now traced the evolution of the dogma of the
Incarnation. It had its root in the teaching of the Wisdom of Solomon that Wisdom, a spiritual emanation from God,
passes into holy souls. Then for Wisdom was substituted the Word, like Wisdom personified, and named the Christ and Son of God, but really believed to be a formless Spirit, taking the shape of those in whom he becomes incarnate. Gradually the personification was more definitely and more literally conceived. Certain men were thought to have been exceptional manifestations of the Christ. Then by some Adam alone was thought to have been, or to have embodied, the Christ and to have appeared upon earth on several occasions. Possibly there was a difference of opinion as to whether Adam was identical with the Christ or whether the Christ assumed the body of Adam when he wished to visit the earth. Finally Jesus was substituted for Adam as the vehicle. Epiphanius says of the Ebionites who believed that the Christ had appeared in the body of Adam that at other
times " when they wished " they said : " No ; but the Spirit which is the Christ came and clothed himself in the body of Jesus." We may safely infer that these contrary opinions were not held by anyone simultaneously, but that among the Ebionites the befief that the Christ had been incarnate in Adam was gradually replaced by the belief either that he had been incarnate in Jesus or that the incarnation in Jesus was a subsequent and recent one ; just as the Peratai believed that in the days of Herod the Logos had descended in the form of the Patriarch Joseph, whose visible body may not have been supposed to be a material one. So far the doctrine even in its latest stage is Gnostic. The Gnostic



THE DOGMA OF THE INCARNATION 145
Cerinthus, or his followers, taught that the Christ descended into Jesus at his baptism and left him again before the
Crucifixion. But as Christianity became popular these Gnostic subtleties fell into disfavour. Pagan converts could more easily accommodate themselves to the simple and more familiar idea that a divine being became man. And
the dogma of " expiation " required that the Son of God should suffer in the flesh. Consequently the doctrine which remained victorious in the second century was the Catholic doctrine that Jesus is the Christ and Son of God.



CHAPTER V
THE NAME JESUS
1. Is it the Name of a Known Man ?
We have seen that in the Odes of Solomon the Christ was
not named Jesus. We have also seen reason to infer that in the early books which lie behind the Clementines, whereas the Christ was said to have appeared as Adam, or to have manifested himself in certain other persons named in the Old Testament, the name of Jesus had not been directly connected with the list of those persons. The inference is confirmed by the fact that Jesus was also ignored by the sects among whom these books apparently originated. Epiphanius says that he had not been able to make out whether the Christ of the book of the Ossaeans was our Lord Jesus Christ. Evidently therefore the name Jesus did not occur in that book. The sect of the Sampsaeans is said to have remained in existence to a later date than that of the Ossaeans, but there was evidently no Jesus in their doctrine. Epiphanius says they were neither Christians nor Jews. They were, in fact, a Jewish sect, and they were Christians in the sense that they revered a divine Christ. Certainly, however, their Christ had no connection with Jesus. The same may be predicated of the early Gnostic Ebionites; but, as was previously pointed out, they, or some of them, did at some time begin to regard Jesus as a manifestation of the Christ. The same statement may be made concerning
the Naassenes and their allied sects. The name " Jesus " is found in the Naassene Hymn, but the character of the
fundamental doctrine of the sect renders it practically certain that the name was not primitive. Origen says that the
Ophites " would not even hear the name of Jesus." * There
1 Contra Cehus, VI, 30. 146



THE NAME JESUS 147
is no evidence that either the Peratai or the Sethians ever adopted the name. The special cult-hero of the former was evidently Joseph and of the latter, Seth. Another Gnostic sect revered Cain. The Christology of the Gnostic sects was evolved in complete independence of the Gospel story/ and of the person of Jesus. Gnostics of the second century adapted their conceptions to some of the articles of orthodox Chris
tian belief, and the use of the name " Jesus " by Basilides and Valentinus can be understood from their acquaintance with a Gospel. Bousset has shown from a consideration of
Iren. I, xxx, ll'ff., that with the earlier narrative of the Saviour who rescues Sophia the figure of the Gospel Jesus is artificially bound up. For to the narrative as it was given in an earlier form is appended the statement that Sophia,
before the coming of the Saviour, had through Jaldabaoth, the chief Archon, without the knowledge of the latter, produced the emission of two men, one of them from the
barren Elizabeth and the other from the virgin Mary. In this manner did Sophia prepare Jesus in advance, so that the Christ, when he descended, might find a pure receptacle. He then united himself with Sophia. Bousset
observes that " this strange and mangled Christology
becomes comprehensible only if we may assume that here an original independent myth of the union of the Saviour with Sophia has been artificially bound up with the figure
of Jesus." 1 Referring again to Iren. I, xi, and I, xv, 3, Bousset shows that the Christ who is said to have become united with Jesus was originally Anthropos.? The name Jesus must, however, have been in use some where at a date earlier than that at which the Naassene Hymn, the Teaching of the Twelve Apostles (Didache) , and the oldest
portions of the Pauline Epistles were composed. Those
Epistles, even if they are not genuine writings of Paul, include Gnostic documents which may reasonably be dated
1 Cp. the union of Nous with Logos in the Sethian doctrine. It
is possible that the Gnostic fable of the union of the Saviour with
Sophia reflects allegorically the amalgamation of the Word with
Wisdom.
2 Hauptprobleme der Gnosis, pp. 240-6.



148 THE NAME JESUS
about the year 50.1 These documents are reproduced in the Appendix to this book. The question then arises :
" What was the origin of the name ? " Most people will,
of course, at once reply that it is the name of a man who was crucified in Jerusalem by order of Pontius Pilate.
But, if we are to act upon the principle laid down by Prof. Guignebert that the scientific historian must believe nothing in advance, we must test the grounds of the prevalent opinion. Since the Gospels are sacred literature, not historical documents, and since the events recorded in them are not substantiated by the evidence of con temporary profane authors, it would not be scientific [to
take for granted the truth even of so much of the
record as is left to it by critical theologians. The Gospels cannot guarantee themselves. Well-known examples in the literature of fiction and of drama prove that
vividness in the execution is no evidence of truth. A
very pertinent question is this : " Would men for whom the Christ was a spiritual being, an emanation from the
ineffable Most High, who, if he had ever manifested himself at all, could be supposed to have done so only in the persons of certain mythical or semi-mythical characters such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, or Joseph, have identified him with an obscure person who had been executed in their
own lifetime ? " We are not now considering the religious
value of the Gospels, but their historical truth. If the
account which they give of the last days of Jesus is his torically true the events recorded must have produced so great a stir throughout Jewry that neither Philo nor
Josephus could have remained ignorant of them. Liberal criticism has indeed been progressively destroying the record until hardly anything now remains but the bare fact of the crucifixion, which is consequently left in the air, so to speak, unsupported by any adequate explanation of its motive; and the Jesus of this criticism, however admirable as a human being, may reasonably be described
1 The Didache in its original form may have been earlier than
this, but the date of the passages in which the name " Jesus " occurs,
though evidently early, is uncertain.



THE NAME JESUS 149
as a rather obscure person. If Jesus was not an obscure person, then, as some who believe in his historicity have rightly perceived, the manner of his execution by a Roman governor proves that he was put to death as a political
agitator; in which case he takes his place by the side of
Judas the Galilean, the " Egyptian false prophet," and
Theudas " the magician," and there is no valid reason why Josephus, who mentions them, should not have mentioned him. The interpolator of the Slavonic Josephus appears to have appreciated this aspect of the matter.
We thus have to fall back upon the idea that it was the unprecedented quality of the teaching of Jesus which created
the belief that he was the Messiah, or the " true Prophet." The true Prophet of the Clementine literature is, however, quite obviously not the Jewish Messiah ; and a Messiah, in Jewish expectation, had to be something more than a teacher. The promulgation of ethical doctrine of a new and admirable kind might cause a man to be hailed as a great prophet ; but there is no example in history of the exalta
tion of a prophet to the position into which Jesus was exalted ; and unfortunately critics of the New Testament cannot agree as to what Jesus taught or even whether his teaching had any special significance for ethics or sociology. The latest of these is Prof. Guignebert, who in his great work Jesus asserts that the only purpose of Jesus was to preach
the Jewish eschatological kingdom. It is difficult to see how a new religion could have been founded upon preaching
of that kind; unless, as Schweitzer supposes, Jesus had succeeded in implanting the belief that he himself would return as the supernatural Messiah to inaugurate the
kingdom —an opinion which Guignebert does not share.
A matter upon which there is so sharp a disagreement is a weak foundation for an historical theory, and really no kind of teaching would be adequate to explain the facts. Those who imagine it to have been the dynamic factor are invited to ponder the opinion of Origen, who, instead of protesting against the preference of Celsus for the best ethical teaching of the Greeks, replies that the teaching of Jesus is better adapted to the comprehension of the ordinary



150 THE NAME JESUS
man ; just as wholesome food of a homely kind is relished by the poor and is beneficial to them.1 The ethical teaching of the Gospels does not rise above the high-water mark of contemporary Greek and Jewish morality, and in some respects even falls below that of the former, especially in positing future reward and punishment as a motive for
well-doing.2 It is the setting in which the Christian maxims are placed, the form in which they have issued from the best Christian minds of the period, and the accord which they consequently awaken in Christian feeling that give to
the utterances of Jesus the appearance of uniqueness. It is evident from the Epistles, Pauline and other, and from the Apologies, that the teaching of Jesus occupied a very subordinate position in the early propaganda. And of the
personality of Jesus, which, though it is no more than an assumption ad hoc, is relied upon by some as an explanation of the whole amazing phenomena, we hear practically
nothing. In the book entitled Octavius, written by Minucius Felix for the purpose of recommending Christianity
to Pagans, the name " Jesus " does not once occur, and there is in it no mention of a Gospel or of any occurrence recorded in one, excepting a slight reference to the Cruci
fixion which is susceptible of a Gnostic interpretation. In
the author's defence and profession of faith " personality "
and " teaching " count for absolutely nothing. As he was
plainly a highly cultured and intelligent man, it would not be unreasonable to infer that he regarded the Gospels
as books written for the edification of Christians, but of no
value as a record of real events. In the Epistles there is no evidence of any impression that had been made by a human
" personality."
At the present day the historicity of Jesus is no more than an hypothesis unsupported by any document which deserves
to be qualified as historical. It is maintained on the ground
that Christianity cannot be explained otherwise. The hypo

Mythology ; and for Greek, Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius
passim.



THE NAME JESUS 151
thesis is legitimate, but is it adequate ? There is at all events sufficient justification for the presentation and impartial consideration of an alternative theory.
2. The " Prophet " Joshua
Something more exalted than a teacher, however powerful his personality, so long as he is supposed to have been subject to human limitations, seems needed to account for the facts. And when we have noted that in the doctrine of various sects the Christ was believed to have manifested himself in Adam, Cain, Abraham, Enoch, Noah, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and Moses, we ought surely to find it rather surprising that the list is terminated by Moses and does not include Joshua, especially as Moses is recorded (Deut. xviii, 15) to have
promised the Israelites that " the Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me." This promise, which of course
refers to Joshua, was referred by Christians of the second
possibly of the late first —century to Jesus. If at that time the promise was believed to have been fulfilled in a re appearance of Joshua, it could easily have happened that we should have no clear and explicit record of the fact.
For if any early writer had intended to say that the Christ had manifested himself in Joshua, or that Joshua was the Christ, writing in Greek the only way in which he could
have made his statement would be that " Jesus is the
Christ," since Jesus is the Greek form of Joshua. In the second century, after the publication of the Gospels, the statement would as a matter of course have been taken to refer to the Gospel Jesus. How easily the misunder standing could have arisen will be evident from the following
quotation from Origen's commentary upon John :
Jesus said to the people : Sanctify yourselves, for to-mor
row the Lord will do wonders among you. And the priests
with the Ark of the Covenant he ordered to pass [over the
Jordan] before the people, when the mystery of the dis
pensation of the Father with respect to the Son was made
manifest, the Son who was exalted by the grace which the
Father bestowed upon him, in order that at the name of
Jesus every knee should bow . . . and that every tongue



152 THE NAME JESUS
should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the Glory of
God the Father. For the same thing is plainly declared
through these words written in the Book of Jesus : And
the Lord said unto Jesus : " This day will I begin to magnify
thee in the sight of all Israel." We have also to hear our
Lord Jesus speaking to the children of Israel : " Come hither
and hear the words of the Lord your God. Hereby ye shall
know that the living God is among you " (Josh. iii. 9). For
in the being baptized unto Jesus we shall know that the living
God is in us.
There is no ambiguity here. The identification of Jesus with Joshua is absolute. Exactly how Origen conceived the
identity is uncertain ; but it would be quite in accordance with his known doctrine
if,
as the Peratai believed that the Logos had made a special revelation of himself in a reappear
ance of Joseph, Origen believed that he had made a special
revelation of himself in a reappearance of Joshua. A link between the two views may perhaps be seen in the name
which the Christians gave to the father of Jesus. It
is
significant that according to Matthew the name of Joseph's father was Jacob. Luke was apparently too wary to repeat this.1 Although as an original thinker Origen may be supposed to have impressed upon the doctrine he received some qualities out of his own mind, in essentials
it
was very much older. His belief that the Logos dwells within men goes back to the Odes
of
Solomon, and his belief that the Logos had always been present in the world was older than
the Clementine Recognitions. It
is
noticeable that after
quoting from the Book of Joshua he alters the phrase " God
is
among you " into " the living God
is
in us "
;
and
it
is
clear from his Commentary upon John that his meaning
is
that God
is
within us as the Word. But apparently, just as some Gnostics thought that the Christ had manifested him self in a particular manner in Adam, so he thought that the Christ had manifested himself in Joshua. This belief was not a product of his own mind. He must have received it. There was undoubtedly an early expecta
tion among Jews that Joshua would reappear. In John's
1
Probably the Messiah ben Joseph was thought of as a reincarna
tion of Joseph himself.



THE NAME JESUS 153
Gospel we are told that Jews who went to question the
Baptist asked him : " Art thou the prophet ? "
(i,
21).
Again, in vii, 40, some of the multitude say of Jesus
:
" This
is
of a truth the prophet
!
" Origen
1
perceived that the
strictly defined term " the prophet " must refer to someone who already existed in the Jewish consciousness, and he identified this prophet with the prophet (Joshua) of Deut.
xviii, 15. There cannot be any doubt that the identification
is
correct. In Matthew we read that some people believed
that Jesus was " one of the prophets." This looks like a deliberate alteration of the earlier phrase, made because the identification of Jesus with Joshua had become a source of
embarrassment. The " true Prophet " of the Clementines
was identified with this prophet. In the Recognitions a
Hellenistic Jew named Niceta says
:
" There
is
mention in
our religion of a certain prophet whose coming was hoped for by all who observe that religion. Through him immortality and a blessed life
is
promised to all who believe.'' Since this prophet
is
obviously
a
divine being, the statement may be taken as evidence that for some Jews at any rate Joshua was the expected heavenly Messiah.
We know from Justin that the " prophet " of Deuteronomy was believed by early Christians to have been both Joshua
and Jesus. For in his Dialogue with Trypho, 62, after
quoting Gen. xlix, 10, Justin says
:
" This was not spoken in
reference to Judah but to the Christ, for all people of all
nations do not expect Judah but Jesus, who brought your
fathers out
of
Egypt."

In Horn. Ill, 53 the Prophet of the truth
is
quoted as having said
:

I
am he of whom Moses prophesied, saying, the Lord your
God will raise up from among you a prophet like unto me.
Hearken unto him in all things. And whoever shall not
hearken unto that prophet shall die.
The true Prophet of the Clementines, having been originally
a spiritual being, could be supposed to have appeared as Adam or Moses or Joshua; but
it
is
very unlikely that a

recently living Galilean prophet can have been associated
with these. In view of the probable relationship between
the Petrine and the Ebionite literature it is significant that in a speech of Peter in Acts (iii, 22-23) Jesus is identified
with the prophet promised by Moses. This identification, coupled with the fact that Joshua was especially honoured in Samaria, throws light upon the taunting assertion of the Jews (Jn. viii, 48) that Jesus was a Samaritan.
3. The Jestjs of the Gospels is One of Several
If it is inconceivable that Gnostics can have given to
their Logos the name of a Galilean peasant, is it any less so that the leader of a small band of humble persons can in so short a time have become the awful Being depicted in the Book of Revelation or the great high priest of the Epistle
to the Hebrews, " made higher than the heavens," " after
the likeness of Melchizedek " who was " without father, without mother, having neither beginning of days nor end
of life " ? Theologians will not be able indefinitely to shirk the enormous difficulties by which their theory is oppressed. The Jesus of the Naassene Hymn has none of the features of the Jesus of the Gospels. He is not born ; he does not come to work miracles or to preach. He descends from Heaven for the liberation of the despairing soul (Psyche) from the gross matter in which she is entangled, bringing to men the Gnosis through which they could overcome the adverse supernatural powers. The writer seems to have
been acquainted with certain Babylonian incantations in
which the saviour-god Marduk begs his Father Ea to send him to earth for the deliverance of men ; but he betrays no
knowledge of any Gospel. Another Jesus who is not the Jesus of the Gospels is found
in the Teaching of the Twelve Apostles. It is admitted by
several competent scholars, including Harnack, that this
document is of Jewish origin. It was certainly in existence in the first century and is probably pre-Gospel. Considerable
additions were made to it by Christians.1 Apart from an

son's The Jesus Problem, Appendix A.



THE NAME JESUS 155
obvious interpolation in chap. VIII there is no reference to the earthly life of Jesus ; but in one of the passages which
are possibly of Ebionite origin it is written : " We thank
thee, our Father, for the life and knowledge which thou hast made known to us through Jesus thy servant (pais)." Whether, as some theologians maintain, Jesus was merely an ethical teacher, or whether, as others believe, his preach
ing was eschatological, the words quoted are inapplicable
to him. A Gnostic could have written them, because know
ledge which is " life " was Gnosis. In chap. IX we are
told that. Jesus had made known " the holy vine of David," of which there is no mention in any Gospel, though in the Fourth, a Gnostic Gospel, he is himself termed
" the vine." The " holy vine " has been interpreted to mean
the Church. But to say that Jesus had " made known " the Church to the community does not give sense. There is also a vine in the Mandaean Book of John, 131-143, which is
named Miriai. Miriai is no doubt a name for the Mandaean community, and it is symbolically transferred to the vine , which is the Living principle or soul of the community ; but
the vine cannot represent the community itself, because it
is said that the members " perch upon it," " eat its leaves,"
and " drink the wine of its entrails." It must typify the
source of spiritual life. " Its leaves are jewels, its fruits are pearls." That would be hyperbole written of the community.
Farther on it is called the " Tree of Life." We note the
Gnostic love of symbolism. The " holy vine of David " must also be a symbol, and a symbol of something very important. We may infer that it symbolized whatever the wine of the Eucharist symbolized for the community in question ; and
from the name " Eucharist " and from the statement that
Jesus had " made it known," it is clear that the thing
symbolized was not the blood of Jesus. In fact in the following chapter the Eucharistic meal is expressly termed
" spiritual food and drink," " given through thy servant,"
and with these is conjoined " eternal life." Hence there is no question here of the Catholic Church or of the Catholic Sacrament. There may have been some symbolic connection
between this Eucharist and a " new covenant " suggested



156 THE NAME JESUS
by Ps. lxxxix, 3 : "I have made a covenant with my elect,
I have sworn unto David my servant." The Jesus of this
document is not " son of David," he is the " servant " {pais) of God.
In the Gnostic Book of Baruch we have yet another Jesus,
who is a shepherd and has practically nothing in common
with the Jesus of the Gospels beyond the dogmatic fact of
his death. The book expresses allegorically the doctrine of a Jewish Gnostic community. Lipsius concluded that this doctrine could have existed long before Christianity.1 Lublinski has demonstrated the early date of its origin.2
A reasonable explanation of all this diversity would be that the name Je&us had a divine connotation, not having in the above-cited cases been attached to a known person. Evidence that Joshua was expected to reappear, or was believed to
have reappeared, is found in the Sibylline Oracles :
Now a certain excellent man shall come again from
Heaven, who spread forth his hands upon the very fruitful
tree, the best of the Hebrews, who once made the sun stand
still, speaking with beauteous words and pure lips.
The section of the Oracles in which these words occur is thought to have been written about the year 80, but the belief expressed in them must have been already current. And, as the Oracles are prophecies ostensibly made at a very much earlier date, the events predicted had occurred before
the book was written. Hence it is not impossible that the reappearance of Joshua was believed to have occurred. The writer was a Jew. Commentators may assume that he was referring to the Jesus of the Gospels ; but there is no evidence that he was acquainted with a Gospel. What is proved is the existence of an expectation among Jews that Joshua would come again from Heaven. And since the Peratai believed that Joseph had reappeared as a mani
festation of the Christ, other Jews can have believed that Joshua had reappeared as a manifestation of the Christ.
The phrase " the very fruitful tree " does not look like a
description of the cross of Jesus. It may reflect a knowledge <
1 Drews, Die Ents. des Chris., p. 116.
2 Die Ents. des Chris., I, 152. '



THE NAME JESUS 157
of the ancient Jewish custom of suspending the body of a
sacrificial victim upon a tree. But also it may involve the
recollection of a Jesus—Jeshu ben Pandera —who, being reputed a wonder-worker, had actually after stoning been hanged upon a tree. Probably general knowledge con cerning this Jesus was very vague, but the fact might serve for the bringing of a religious belief to a focus. Mr. Hugh Schonfield1 has reproduced for English readers the result of Samuel Krauss's analysis of the Jewish book Toldoth
Jeshu, showing that a very early work has been overloaded with later additions. The book has been expanded from
knowledge of the Gospels, but the kernel of it seems to have been a pre-Gospel story of Jeshu ben Pandera. References in the Talmud to this Jeshu rather suggest that some story of which he was the subject was in existence at a very early
date. And if the story was known to early Christians the
borrowing need not have been all one way. In Toldoth Jeshu
iv, 25, we read concerning the death of ben Pandera :
When they had let him hang until the time of afternoon
they took him down from the tree, for so it is written [Deut.
xxi, 23]. Then they buried him.
With this may be compared Acts xiii, 29 :
And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they
took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre
—in conjunction with Acts x, 39, where it is said that Jesus was slain and hanged on a tree by the Jews. The statement that it was the Jews who, after killing Jesus, took him down from the tree points to some source independent of, and
probably a good deal earlier than, the Gospel narrative — a
source which had nothing to tell either of Joseph of
Arimathea or of Pilate —and it is by no means inconceivable that this source may have been the account of ben Pandora's
death which has been included in Toldoth Jeshu. It is, however, unlikely that the name itself was taken from this
or from any other man. Nor is it likely that the Christ was actually identified with ben Pandera. The knowledge that a wonder-working Jesus had been put to death by the Jews
could merely add substance to an evolving dogma. In a
1 According to the Hebrews.



158 THE NAME JESUS
period when beliefs of the kind which have been indicated were held about Joshua, and when the Christ was imagined
to have manifested himself in Joseph and in Moses, it would
be extraordinary indeed if no one had hit upon the idea
that he had appeared as " the best of the Hebrews." We have a right to conclude that the belief existed long before
the time of Origen and even before any Gospel had been
written. At first the date of the supposed appearance of the Christ in the body of Joshua would be as indefinite as that of his supposed appearance in the body of Adam was among the Gnostic Ebionites.
4. LATERALIZATION OF GNOSTIC SYMBOLISM
In the Book of Baruch, probably written shortly after the
year 70, it is said that Wisdom " appeared upon earth and was conversant with men." The idea was not then new, and in exactly the same sense Gnostics, following the Odes of
Solomon, could say that the Word had " appeared upon
earth." A descent of the Logos was part of the earliest doctrine of the Gnostic sects in general. The gradual literalization of the idea is perfectly intelligible. The growth and
multiplication of cults were the result of the universal longing for a Saviour. There was felt the need of a divine being not too dissimilar or too remote from men, to whom petitions could be hopefully addressed, and through whom immortality might be secured. The poor and the oppressed snatched at any comfortable belief; and their credulity was profound. When the Word had been named Son of God and Christ his individualization became inevitable. What ever some of the leaders and teachers continued to think had to be reserved as esoteric lore to be revealed only to such as were able to receive it. Origen hints at the existence
of esoteric lore suitable only for " the perfect " even in his time.
In the case of the Naassenes we can actually see the individualization in progress. The Naassene Logos was a
" formless " spirit which descends for the rescue of the
World-soul. In the Naassene Hymn traces of the primitive doctrine are clearly perceptible, but the Soul has been



THE NAME JESUS 159
allegorized into a woman " wandering in a labyrinth " and the Christ into a person, the Son of God, who with the permission of his Father goes down to liberate her. Con joined with this we have the more developed and more concretely expressed idea that the object of the descent is the salvation of men. And the Christ has now acquired a name. At this stage there arose a difference of opinion as to the nature of the descending Christ. The notion of a
disembodied —naked —spirit was repugnant to the ancient
mind. Gnostic teachers who supposed that Adam, or Joshua, had come again from Heaven as the visible clothing of the spiritual Christ would reckon the substance of the descending being to be psyche, whence came Docetism. Gnostics who believed that matter is intrinsically evil could
not admit that Christ had appeared in the flesh. But it must have been the common belief of Jews that Enoch, Moses, and Elijah had been translated in the flesh. There were many Jews in the early Christian communities; and the
Catholic party took over the Jewish doctrine of a bodily
resurrection. The thought of the eternal life of the spirit
did not content them. A salvation which did not include the salvation of the body seemed to them incomplete, and so they insisted upon a resurrection of the whole man. And, since in their view the bodily resurrection of Jesus was the guarantee of this, they fought for it, in the words of van den
Bergh van Eysinga, " with all the weapons in their armoury." Doubtless the resurrection narratives, so material in their detail, were invented for the express purpose of establishing the dogma . Expiation, moreover, seemed to them incomplete
without the suffering of the divine victim. In the conflict of opinion the materialistic view prevailed and so became the orthodox doctrine of the Churches. We are not definitely told that the Gnostic Ebionites were Docetists, but Epiphanius
says that " some of them denied that Jesus was a man."
5. The Name a Divine One Before the Christian Era
There is evidence that the name Jesus was a divine one before the Christian era. The disciples are said to have cast out demons in the name of Jesus in places where he had



160 THE NAME JESUS
never been, so that the power was believed to reside in the name. The ancients imagined that there was some very intimate relation between a name and the person who bore it. Consequently divine names were thought to have great efficacy in certain cases ; and so thoroughly was the efficacy considered to reside in the name that a name translated into another language was supposed to lose any divine or magic power that might be inherent in it.1 Moreover the power was thought to be independent of the belief of the person using the name. Origen says that anyone by pronouncing the
formula " the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob " could bring demons into subjection. Justin. ' advances as evidence of the divinity of Jesus the com pelling power of his name. Justin no doubt believed that Jesus had really lived; but he also believed that he had been the Son of God before he appeared upon earth. And, indeed, unless Jesus had been divine before he was human the ascription of such power to his name at so early a date as was the case is very improbable. No one would have ascribed
such power to the name of a man, unless it were the name of
some very exceptional man of the remote past—Solomon, for example. We are told, however (Mk. ix, 38), that
persons who were not followers of Jesus were able to cast out demons by the use of his name. That the name of a man actually living should have been used in exorcisms is
incredible. No doubt the episode in the form in which it is presented is unhistorical ; but it affords evidence of the use of the name Jesus for the purpose stated at a very early
date. It is quite likely that the name was used in exorcisms
even early in the first century. In a form of conjuration
preserved in a papyrus occurs the formula, " I adjure thee
by Jesus the god of the Hebrews." No names but those of gods and of more or less mythical persons are ever found in these formulas. The connection between magic and religion was too intimate for anything else to be possible.
Further evidence is found in Acts xix, 13, where it is said that Jews in Asia Minor used to pronounce over those who were supposed to be possessed by evil spirits the formula
1 Origen, Contra Celsus, V, 45.



THE NAME JESUS 161
" I adjure you by Jesus." The immediately following
words, " whom Paul preacheth " were certainly added by the writei\Nk4t is inconceivable that Jews can have attached divine authority to the name of a man not long dead, who, in their opinion, had been an impostor.) The compiler of Acts probably knew more about the state of the case than he cared to admit. He of course believed that Jesus was a divine being; and the Jews who used the name must have
believed it to be a divine one; but not in consequence of Paul's preaching. There is evidence in the Talmud that some Jews employed the name Jeshu as a magical name
capable of healing diseases ; and it would be arbitrary to
assume that these Jews were Christians. If the name had
been continuously held to be divine from an early period it
is not impossible that the origin of it was not known by all
those who used it. But it is certain that by some Jews and by Samaritans in general an exalted status was ascribed to Joshua, and to this day he figures in the Jewish New Year
ritual as the " Prince of the Presence "—an indication that at one time he was the Metatron, undoubtedly a divine being. ( Of all the names which were applied by any Gnostics to
the Christ, Jesus (Jeshua or Jeshu) was the most likely to
secure general adoption, because the name signifies a Saviour^ We find in Matthew evidence that the name was
chosen for that very reason. The angel says to Joseph,
" Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for it is he that shall save his people from their sins." The function assigned is that of a divine being and not within the competence of any man.
Justin again in his Dialogue with Trypho and elsewhere stresses this meaning of the name. Epiphanius gives inform ation concerning a sect of Nasaraeans which, he says, existed long before Christ. Since we know that there were preChristian Gnostics who revered a Christ, there is no im probability in the statement ; and it may possibly throw some light upon the designation of Jesus as the Nazarene, which term, as scholars have recognized, cannot have been derived from Nazareth. Nazarene and Nazaroean may be merely different Greek renderings of the Aramaic or Syriac. W. B. Smith pointed out that there is a Hebrew root natsar



162 THE NAME JESUS
which means to guard or to preserve from evil. The participial
substantive formed from this root is notser, which would mean a preserver or saviour, and is consequently synonymous with Jesus. Nazarene, of which the Hebrew equivalent is notsri, could be formed from the same root by the addition of a Greek adjectival suffix ; and thus we get for the meaning of Jesus Nazarene the saviour who preserves. Nasaroean would then quite naturally be the designation of a sect which revered a Saviour. By Greek-speaking people, as W. B. Smith pointed out, the name Jesus would readily be connected in thought with Jesis (healing) and with Jaso (genitive Jasous), the goddess of health and healing.
Epiphanius observes that " in the Hebrew dialect Jesus
(Jesous) is called therapeut —that is, physician and saviour."
It is known that the Greek name Jason was considered by
Jews to be equivalent to Jeshua or Jeshu; and we know
from Strabo and Justin that the cult of Jason was widely spread not only in Asia Minor but also in the West. He too was a healer and a saviour. s. Jesus, as the common name for the Christ, then became the chief bond of union among men whose doctrines differed so much from one another as those exhibited in the Gospels
of Mark and John, and in the Epistles of Paul, James, and Barnabas. And the varieties are not exhausted in the mention of these names.- As a synthesis of doctrines originally diverse, Christianity can be understood.) As a doctrine
emanating from a single man and a single place or from a
single sphere of thought, it is incomprehensible. Even early in the first century a great diversity of theosophical specu lation and of ideas about the Christ were agitating men's minds. The diversity existed before there was unity. I Real
unity was, in fact, never achieved. , The Judaic and the Messianic elements in Christianity must have had an entirely different origin from the Gnostic elements. ( Jesus nowhere appears as the originator of dogma j he is always the subject of it. Differentiation in Jewish Gnosticism may have begun
very early. If, as some scholars are now inclined to think,
Philo had to some degree come under the influence of
oriental mysticism, it may be supposed that some of the



THE NAME JESUS 163
Gnostic sects were also being influenced by it, while upon others it appears to have had but Little effect.1 Those which worked out a simple form of doctrine comparatively free from mythical allegory and cosmological speculation would be likely to make the widest popular appeal. And thus from the welter of competing dogmas there gradually emerged a system of Christology and Soteriology which, though at
first it appeared in somewhat different forms, of which the most important are those known as Pauline and Johannine,
may be termed Gnostic Christianity. In its most primitive form as exemplified in the Odes and in some other early Gnostic writings, the chief stress was laid upon the descent of the Christ and redemption through union with him, or by reception of the divine Spirit, and through the know ledge of God which the Christ brings. Those conceptions are still apparent in the Pauline and Johannine Christianity.2
In this literature knowledge of God is still a prerequisite for the possibility of salvation ; but the significance which most of the Gnostic sects were beginning to attach to
" Gnosis " would probably render Christians disinclined to continue the use of the term. The supreme importance of
" knowledge "—sc. of God —cannot have been a Catholic thought, for the God of Catholic Christianity was Jehovah, who had long been known. The most striking difference between the Pauline and the primitive Gnosticism is the special emphasis laid in the former upon the death of the
Christ —not, however, as an expiatory sacrifice. The origin of that conception must next be considered.
1 The work of Reitzenstein has made it probable that in the first
century at any rate the operative influence was Egyptian rather
than oriental.

CHAPTER VI
THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST
1. The Trial By Pilate
A scientific treatment of the subject requires that the generally accepted account of the death of Jesus should be critically examined. This has already been done with various degrees of thoroughness by several critical theo logians. Theologians necessarily come to this examina tion with a bias, but the candour displayed by some of them is laudable, and certain important conclusions may be held to have been established. Among these is the conclusion of Loisy that the trial by the Sanhedrin is unhistorical. Schmiedel has come to the same conclusion; and the correctness of it cannot be doubted when we note that by the Jewish law a trial during the night was forbidden, and that before a capital sentence could be pronounced two sittings of
the court separated by a night had to be held. It is, more over, inconceivable that the Jewish leaders could have made an arrest by an armed band during the night on which the Passover was eaten. The law forbade anyone to leave his
house on that night. If we accept the chronology of the
Fourth Gospel, then, as Schmiedel has observed, " the four teenth of Nisan had already begun when Jesus was arrested, so that the second trial could not have fallen before the fifteenth of Nisan, which would mean the great Feast-day, on which, we may be sure, no trial could have been held." The best modern critics reject Mk. xiv, 61, 62, as spurious, and when these verses are eliminated no charge entailing the death penalty remains. Guignebert's comment is that
" nothing is less certain than the trial before the San
hedrin." * He infers finally that " the probability is that the Nazarene was arrested by the Roman police, judged, and
1 Jesus, p. 460. 164



THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST 165
condemned by the Roman procurator —Pilate or someone else."
What, then, of the historicity of this trial ? In the first place there is no evidence at all of any political activity on the part of Jesus which could have alarmed the Roman governor. No clear intimation as to the grounds upon which Jesus was accused and condemned is obtainable from the Gospels. According to the record he was charged with having wished to make himself King of the Jews ; but the Jesus of the Gospels never laid himself open to that charge ; critical theologians do not believe that he ever expressed such a wish, and in the account of the trial no evidence of his having done
so is brought forward. Even if it be assumed that Jesus had resolved not to defend himself, is it likely that he would have
kept silent when that charge was made ? If he was deter mined to die, his determination must have been for the furtherance of some principle. There would have been no sense at all in his allowing himself to be put to death on a
false issue , particularly on that issue . All historical examples
of the execution of fanatical idealists make it certain that Jesus would have spurned the false accusation and pro claimed the ideas for which he was ready to suffer. We are
told that when charged he answered " Thou sayest," which would be understood as an admission. The writer of the Fourth Gospel saw that such an admission without explana tion was incredible, and he supplied one. According to the Synoptics, Jesus, having made the admission, refused to say another word. The account has not the semblance of reality. Can any intelligible explanation of the silence of Jesus be
given beyond Isa. liii, 7 ? And who can speak of " history " in connection with a narrative so motived ? Some critics explain that the disciples had no means of learning accurately what took place at the trial. But they have not even
transmitted to us any knowledge of the principle for which
Jesus is supposed to have suffered. If, however, we go behind the Gospels to the earlier Christian literature, in which there is no hint of a judicial execution, we can find the solution of the enigma. Jesus puts up no defence and makes no proclamation, simply because he hud to die, not



166 THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST
historically but dogmatically, not for any principle or idea,
but for the salvation of mankind ; and the earliest Christian writers knew no other reason.
The Triumphal Entry may be mentioned. But if that had been the offence Pilate would have taken action at once. According to Bousset this affair was a comparatively harm less and insignificant scene of which the character was after wards transformed in the tradition of the Christian com munity. Guignebert, however, gives very good reasons for rejecting entirely both this episode and that of the Purging
of the Temple,1 which no man without official authority would have been allowed to carry out. After a critical analysis which yields no positive result, the French Professor can but fall back upon the vague accusation recorded by
Luke that " He stirreth up the people, beginning from Galilee to this place." But what in the teaching ascribed to Jesus in the Gospels could have caused any uneasiness to Pilate ?
Moreover, as Guignebert observes, " while Luke records this
accusation he does not know that it was actually brought for ward ; he simply infers it from the circumstances." Bousset also, after critically discussing the trial, is obliged to conclude
that " we can no longer say definitely on what ground Jesus
was condemned by Pilate. ' ' 2 Pilate in fact pronounces Jesus innocent, and on the evidence he could do no other. Pilate may not have been particularly scrupulous, but it was not in his character to curry favour with the Jews by condemning to death an innocent person. He never showed any regard for Jewish susceptibilities. Some strong motive or prejudice might conceivably have induced him to be unjust, but no sufficient motive can be imagined in the present case.
It would have been necessary to put before him, not merely vague accusations, but reliable evidence of political activity.
Roman justice, like English, had a tradition. If the modern view of the teaching of Jesus is in any degree correct he must have seemed to Pilate a very inoffensive person ; and one can hardly suppose that Pilate would have accepted without testing it any false statement that was made to him, assum
1 Jesus, pp. 228 f. and 418.
• Kyr. Chr., p. 56.



THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST 167
ing that the Jewish leaders were wicked enough to make false accusations for the purpose of securing the execution of an innocent man. Not only have we no right to assume this ; no sufficient reason can be given for an intensity of hatred which would have driven them to that point, and none at all for the hostile clamour of the people which, according to the story, was the deciding factor. Several Jewish scholars 1 have shown that the Pharisees described in the Gospel are Pharisees of the time when the Gospels were written, but not all of them, and that the description does not at all corre spond with those of the year 30. The invective put into the mouth of Jesus is the invective of the writers, and the hatred affirmed is the hatred which existed between the Christians and Pharisaic Jewry in the second century. According to Guignebert the accounts of the conflicts between Jesus and the Scribes and Pharisees in Jerusalem are wholly fictitious.2 Thus no adequate reason for the execution of Jesus can be imagined. Some theologians have described the trial by
Pilate as " a parody of justice." And so it is. But when we read in a document of which even theological critics are obliged to expunge more than half as being fictitious the account of a trial by a Roman procurator for which no
reasonable motive can be assigned and which in detail is " a
parody of justice "—to which, moreover, there is no reference in any Christian document earlier in its existing form than
the second century —we are not entitled to assume its histori city as a matter of course. And there are known facts which
justify grave doubt as to whether it took place.
2. The Gospel of Peter
The writer of the Acts of the Apostles made use of earlier sources, some of which may contain fragments still older. One cannot be sure that the longer speeches recorded in the book have not been expanded; but in a short speech of
Peter (v, 30) occurs the statement, " Jesus whom ye slew,
hanging him on a tree," addressed to the Jews. Whatever may be read into these words from a presupposition that the
1 E.g., Chwolaon, Friedlander, and Lublinski.
* Jesus, p. 421.



168 THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST
trial and condemnation by Pilate are historical, their plain and natural meaning is that Jesus was killed and hung upon a tree by Jews. Consequently, to say the least, they afford reasonable ground for the conjecture that in an early form of the story of the Passion Jesus was put to death by Jews without the intervention of Pilate. There must at one time have existed a somewhat voluminous Petrine literature of which we possess only a garbled remnant. Included in this literature is the Gospel of Peter, which, in the opinion of a
good many of the best critics, was used by Justin. This writer, indeed, appears to have referred to it by name in Dial. 106, where he says that Jesus changed Peter's name and that this is written in his (Peter's) memoirs. Since a very large
proportion indeed of Justin's quotations differ more or less from the text of Matthew, whereas it is known that some of them were taken from the Gospel according to the Hebrews, it is a reasonable inference that he used apocryphal Gospels of earlier date than the canonical, from which no one can be proved to have quoted until after his time, and that one of
those he used was the Gospel of Peter. A comparison of the
Synoptics with one another renders it perfectly certain that they are based upon a common original, which must have been shorter than any of them. This common original, which may be called the Primitive Gospel, has been supposed by critics to have been an early form of Mark. That may be correct in a certain sense, but it does not follow that Mark's name was attached to the Primitive Gospel, and it is not likely that it was. Both Matthew and Mark attained their present form by a
process of growth, and since it is fairly certain that their existing titles are not primitive, there must have been earlier forms of the Gospel, known under different titles, which were eventually superseded, partly because they were shorter and so appeared to be incomplete, and partly because through development of doctrine they had come to be regarded as heretical. From the information we possess concerning the
Gospel according to the Hebrews it is hardly possible to doubt
that there was a rather close affinity between it and the Gospel of Matthew. And since in the Stichometry of



THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST 169
Nicephorus Matthew's Gospel is said to have 2500 verses while that according to the Hebrews has only 2200 we must infer
that the former represents an earlier stage in the growth of the Gospel. That Gospel is also mentioned by early Christian writers before anything is heard of Matthew. Similarly behind Mark there must have been an earlier form of Gospel which was afterwards classed as apocryphal and fell into neglect. Such was the fate of the Gospel of Peter, which is
more ancient than Matthew and therefore than Mark in its existing form. As Dr. W. B. Bacon has shown, this Gospel had a history, and he recognizes in it at least three strata. The conclusion of B. Weiss that in a number of cases where passages are common to both Gospels Matthew has preserved the more original form is easily demonstrable. There is internal evidence of the priority of the Gospel of Peter to our
canonical Gospels—for example, the fact that in it after the crucifixion the circle of twelve disciples is unbroken, proving that the Gospel cannot have contained the story of the betrayal by Judas. There is an interesting statement by Papias (150 C.E.) to the effect that Mark wrote his Gospel
from information which he had obtained from Peter. Com mentators have found it difficult to reconcile this statement
with the actual character of Mark's Gospel. It is generally rejected ; yet it seems likely that some fact lies behind the statement. Now Papias does not say that Mark's name was actually attached to the Gospel in question, and there is no external evidence of the existence of Mark's Gospel until a later date. Papias says that Mark wrote down what he had
heard from Peter; hence it seems not impossible that Peter's name may have been attached to the Gospel, and
that an expanded form of it may have been afterwards
named " according to Mark " in consequence of the statement of Papias. But it is evident from the fragment we have that the Gospel of Peter itself was independently elaborated.
No doubt it continued to be used in certain communities (Gnostic) after the canonical Gospels had been composed.1
1 Serapion {ca. 200 c.e.) found a Gospel according to Peter in use
at Rhossos, and he expressed his fear that the doctrine of the com
munity was heretical.

170 THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST
Several commentators now agree that the story of the
Passion was independently composed. In the existing Gospels it is much amplified.1 Probably, therefore, the original narrative was little more than an account of the death of Jesus and incidents immediately connected there
with ; and a much earlier form of it than we have in the canonical Gospels is recoverable from the Gospel of Peter.2
Behind the extant account there lies an older narrative which has been amplified in one manner in the Synoptics and in a
different manner in John. The discrepancies merely prove that the determining influence in each case was not historical but dogmatic. And there is no reason at all for preferring a
particular version because it has been labelled " canonical-"
to an earlier " apocryphal " one. " Canonical " is not
synonymous with " true," and canonicity is not the result of a critical investigation, of which the early Christian Fathers were totally incapable. The men who chose the four had no doubt good reasons for their choice, but historical truth was
not the criterion. If it had been, either the Synoptics must
have excluded the Fourth, or contrariwise. Prima facie, if there were any historical facts at all, the earlier version is the
more likely to be correct, even if less complete. It is un critical to assume that, because the narrative of the Gospel of
Peter differs considerably from that of the others, it must be a falsification of theirs. There are good critical grounds for a very different opinion. The oldest definite statement on record (Cerinthus) concerning the death of Jesus exhibits a
view of his nature which is found in the Gospel of Peter. This
Gospel may be no more true than the others, but at any rate it presents an earlier form of belief. According to this Gospel the trial of Jesus was conducted
by Herod, who is styled " Herod the King." 3 It is assumed that the writer has made a mistake in so styling him, be cause the only Herod who fits the accepted chronology is
Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee. There are, however,

dix A.

Passion.



THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST 171
three possibilities. The writer, though he mistakenly calls him King, may have known that Herod was ruler of Galilee.
In that case, since Herod Antipas had his residence at Tiberias and had no jurisdiction in Judaea, the scene of the trial and crucifixion must have been laid in Galilee. There are certain facts which could be explained on this supposition. Bousset characterizes as very early and incontrovertible the tradition that immediately after the arrest of Jesus the disciples fled into Galilee.1 The evidence in the canonical
Gospels for this " tradition " is found in the statements that
the disciples " fled," that they were " scattered " and left Jesus alone, and that the risen Jesus appeared to them in
Galilee. It is conceivable that just as the birth-place of Jesus, which in the earliest form of the story was not Bethle
hem, was afterwards made so, because it was thought
necessary that the Messiah should be born in the city of David, so the scene of his death, which perhaps in an earlier version had been placed in Galilee, may afterwards have been transferred to Jerusalem, because Jerusalem seemed a more appropriate place for him to die in. The belief that the disciples had fled, though probably early, may not have been earliest. For it is under grave suspicion of having been motived by Zech. xiii, 7. The flight of the disciples from Jerusalem to Galilee would then afford a convenient explana tion of their presence in Galilee immediately after the crucifixion.
In the existing texts the " tradition " has been obscured.
It is in fact contradicted by implication in Mk. xvi, 7, and
explicitly in Lk. xxiv, 2. Probably when the status of the disciples had been elevated from that of poor fishermen to the
leadership of the first Christian Church it was felt desirable to remove from them the discredit of a flight. This was done by the statement in Mk. xvi, 7, that the disciples were bidden by the young man whom the women found in the tomb to go
into Galilee. In this way their presence in Galilee was still
accounted for. But the women, it is added, said nothing to anyone ; and there is no intimation that the disciples went.
1 Kyr. Chr., p. 44. Schmiedel, The Johannine Writings, pp. 311 f.,
assents to Bousset's opinion.



172 THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST
If they had fled they were already there. Inferably this
message was an afterthought. The " saying nothing " refers to verses 5 and 6, and verse 7 is an interpolation.1 There was no doubt a motive for this interpolation, and there is something strange about the whole affair. The disciples would surely have returned to their homes in Galilee without
needing to be bidden by an angel to do so ; and if they had tarried for a while in Jerusalem it is not easy to imagine a reason why Jesus should not have been said to have appeared
to them there. In the Third and Fourth Gospels he does in fact appear to them there. These phenomena are not in consistent with a suspicion that the narrative was gradually accommodating itself to a crucifixion in Jerusalem. Mark's omission to record the removal of the disciples is made good in Matthew; but the Gospel of Peter, which
relates the visit of the women to the tomb and their meeting with the young man, knows nothing of his message to the
disciples. It may be confidently inferred that this Gospel was written before the verse xvi, 7 had been interpolated in
Mark. In the latter Gospel it is explained that the women
had followed Jesus from Galilee. In the Gospel of Peter that
explanation is not given, and the natural implication of the statement there made is that the women were habitually resident in the town near which the tomb was situated.
" Mary Magdalene, a female disciple of the Lord . . . took with her her female friends, and came to the sepulchre where
he was laid." A little later on the women say " we will bewail him until we come to our house." Moreover there is no clear intimation of the return of the disciples from Jerusalem to
Galilee. In § 12 it is said that the disciples " withdrew every
man to his house sorrowing." The expression is not un ambiguous, but in the absence of corroborative information
one would not take it to mean a journey from Jerusalem to Galilee. Certainly as the text now stands the crucifixion is said to have taken place at Jerusalem ; but, as will be shown in fuller detail in Appendix A, additions have been made to the narrative; and, in particular, in the original Gospel or its
1 Wellhausen concluded that verse 7 has been interpolated.



THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST 173
source there was no mention of Pilate. The proceedings at the trial are unfortunately not included in the surviving
fragment, but at the close of it we are told that " Herod the King commanded the Lord to be taken, saying unto them,
' What things soever I commanded you to do unto him, do
ye.' " Herod therefore had full authority to judge and to condemn. Luke was evidently acquainted with a source in which a trial by Herod was recorded and he endeavoured to reconcile the two accounts by saying that Pilate sent Jesus to Herod, who, he explains, happened to be in Jerusalem at the
time —an impossible story ! If Jesus was crucified by order
of Pilate the condemnation must have been on political
grounds. But then Pilate would have kept the proceedings in his own hands and retained control of the body of Jesus
until death supervened. In the Gospel of Peter Pilate sits
with Herod for the trial —a greater absurdity than the story of Luke ! Too great, indeed, to have been perpetrated by the original writer, and explicable only by the determination of a redactor to ascribe to Pilate some participation in the proceedings. On the assumption upon which we are at present working the Herod in question was believed by the writer to have been Herod Antipas, though mistakenly styled King. The writer must at least have known that
Pilate had no jurisdiction in Galilee, above all if he supposed
Herod to have been king of that country. It is not con ceivable that Herod, having jurisdiction in his own tetrarchy, would have invited the Roman procurator of Judaea to sit
upon the bench with him. In this Gospel, again, it is said that when Joseph begged the body of Jesus for burial
" Pilate sent to Herod and begged his body." The disposal of the body of Jesus thus lay with Herod, which could not
have been the case if he had been crucified by Pilate. And Joseph would have known that Herod was the proper person to whom to apply.
A peculiarity of the Gospel is that Joseph begs the body of Jesus before the crucifixion. Herod, when the petition is
presented to him, observes that he would in any case have
had the body buried that day, " for it is written in the Law that the sun set not on one that hath died by violence."



174 THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST
Hence in this version of the story Herod knows beforehand that Jesus would be dead the same day ; and yet it was most unlikely and not to be expected that death upon the cross would ensue within so short a time as is stated. Presumably the petition of Joseph, which in the first instance is so strangely addressed to Pilate, was taken from the current* version and inadvertently inserted into an inappropriate
context. The repetition later on of the words, " it is written that the sun set not, etc.," suggests that the Gospel had not
always contained Pilate's request and Herod's reply. It is plain that Pilate has been imported into a narrative which originally knew nothing about him. The contrary assump tion that Herod was foisted upon a narrative in which Pilate had been the principal actor is manifestly untenable. On no critical ground could it be sustained. Herod is woven into the very texture of the story. Pilate is not only completely superfluous and a mere supernumerary; he is actually an
incongruous figure. In the canonical Gospels the substitu
tion of Pilate for Herod, except in Luke, where traces of
the earlier version peep through, has been thoroughly and consistently made; but the result is an account which is essentially incredible.
The other possible explanations of the title "King " are
either that the writer confused Herod Agrippa with King Herod the Great, or that King Herod was actually intended. The latter supposition is not so unreasonable as may at first
sight appear. In Mark's Gospel no date for the appearance
of Jesus is fixed. If, as is likely, that was the case in the earliest form of the story, then, before the introduction of Pilate the death of Jesus could have been placed just as well in the time of Herod the Great as in that of Herod Agrippa.
If either of the latter two possibilities be accepted, Pilate is
excluded, since it is not conceivable that the writer would not have known that there was no Roman governor in Judaea during the reign of Herod the King.
In the Gospel of Peter, Herod, after passing sentence upon
Jesus, delivers him to the people, who enact the scene of crowning, mocking, and scourging, which in Matthew and Mark is enacted by the soldiers of Pilate. One may con



THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST 175
fidently assert that a prisoner formally condemned to death would not have been spontaneously so treated by disciplined Roman soldiers. An officer would have been responsible for him. And the soldiers could have had no motive for so acting. Jesus to them must have been just a condemned prisoner, like any other. They could not have connected with him all the ideas which Christians have about him. Leading modern critical theologians do not in fact believe that Jesus ever claimed to be the Messiah, the Son of God, or the King of the Jews, in which case there would have been no inducement for the soldiers to crown him and array him in a
purple robe. It is well known that this scene is a close copy of an ancient rite practised in connection with the sacrifice of the mock king.1 Hence the statement in the Gospel of Peter
that the actors in the scene were the people is by far the more likely to be primitive. Luke, who, as critics are aware, had access to some source or sources not used by the earlier Evangelists, presents us with an intermediate stage in the
development of the story, stating that it was Herod and his soldiers, not the soldiers of Pilate, who enacted this scene. Here we have additional evidence of the fact that in Matthew and Mark Pilate has taken the place which Herod occupied in
an earlier version. It may be suspected that Luke had some knowledge of the origin of the performance, for he suppressed its distinctive features.
If there is a connection between Jesus and Joshua, who was an Ephraimite rather than a Judaean hero, there is an antecedent probability that a rite which had been attached to his worship was originally practised outside of Judaea. The narrative of the Crucifixion is a most unsubstantial
literary product. A trial which has been pronounced unhistorical by the foremost theological critics is followed by another which for the sake of the historical hypothesis is desperately retained, although it is inexplicable. The Mosaic Law is repeatedly violated by Jews. Details have been supplied from the Old Testament; the betrayal by Judas and other important incidents are rejected by leading critics as fiction ; a scene is described at which there was no
1 See Golden Bough, abr. ed., pp. vi and 443.



176 THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST
witness ; several critics have concluded that the burial in a rock tomb, and consequently all circumstances connected therewith, are inventions; the Evangelists contradict one another as to the day on which the crucifixion took place, apparently from a dogmatic motive, and even as to the words which Jesus uttered in his dying moments ; and no Golgotha by Jerusalem has ever been known. Would any scientific historian consider of the slightest evidential value a secular narrative of a similar character ? Why should the trial by Pilate be accepted as a fact ? The narrative of the Gospel of
Peter is quite as likely to be true. If, therefore, the matter were not one of religious belief what confidence could be felt by any unprejudiced person in the historical reality of an event of which the transmitted accounts are so entirely incompatible ? One fact only subsists, and that not the fact of the death of Jesus but of the belief in it. Some of the most advanced modern theologians would probably not seriously dispute the statements made above, but, with Prof. Guignebert, would amend the statement that belief in the death of Jesus existed into the statement that knowledge of
it existed. But, if that had been the case, surely one might
have expected some degree of precision in the details. In the oldest documents, the Epistles, no knowledge is apparent at
all, but only dogmatic beUef—the belief that the Christ had
died voluntarily for the salvation of the world. It seems that modern critical theologians can no more than the old Catholics find satisfaction for their religious emotions in a spiritual Christ ; they must have a material one ; because a
spiritual Christ is not sufficiently " real."
3. The Death of Hercules
In Seneca's Hercules on Oeta we have a dramatized account of the death of Hercules which it is instructive to compare with the Gospel account of the death of Jesus. The urama has been summarized by van den Bergh van Eysinga, as
follows 1 :
The hero is designated the Son of God who appeared upon
earth to suffer for men, and to take death upon himself in
1 Leeft Jezus of Heeft Hij Atteen Maar Qeleefd ? p. 128 f.



THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST 177
order to be exalted to God the Father. Though having the
righf to dwell in Heaven, he chooses the way to the stars
along the fearful path of suffering. He debases himself to
the position of a servant to bring peace upon the earth.
He takes upon earth the place of the highest God, whom he
names his Father. As mortal man shall the divine being
taste of death and be buried. Joyfully he brings the offering
of his life. Though forsaken by all men he keeps silent under
the bitterest suffering, and death has no power over him.
When he calls for water his request is not listened to. He
speaks to his sorrowing mother —a witness of his suffering
—with the encouraging words, " Thy son liveth." Now
his Father calls to him and the Son prays : " Receive my
spirit into the height." Nature shares in the suffering of
the god-man in that God causes darkness to reign over the
earth, and the thunder to rumble; but the Son can utter
the words : " It is finished." For all things have been
made subject to him, over all the evil powers he has
triumphed; now at last he conquers even death and the
grave. As a god he is exalted to Heaven.
The account of the death of Hercules in Seneca's drama
need not have exercised a direct literary influence upon the
Gospel story of the Passion. The parallel shows, however,
in any case that the picture of the suffering, dying, and
ascending Son of God of the Gospels was to be found even
in many of its details in the doctrine of the Stoa and was
realistically set forth without any historical background.
A specious appearance of reality has been given to the Gospel narrative by assigning to the death of Jesus a definite
date, and by connecting it with some known historical
persons. Intrinsically it has no more claim to be considered historical than Seneca's account of the death of Hercules. Of no great religion has the central point ever been an histori
cal event. Gnostic Christianity originated in theosophy
" our philosophy "—as Melito termed it. Melito traces the
beginning of his " philosophy " into the reign of Augustus,
thus making it antedate, certainly the public appearance and possibly even the accepted year of the birth of Jesus.
4. Naassene Doctrine of the Death of the Son of Man
It would be a mistake to suppose that the earliest Christians could not have arrived at the idea that the Christ had been put to death unless some man who had been



178 THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST
identified with the Christ had actually suffered. Gnostic Christianity grew up among Jews of the Dispersion who were
in contact with cults of dying and reviving deities. It is not likely that Jewish Gnostics believed in the physical death
and resurrection of a divine Saviour ; but it was characteristic of their mentality to express their metaphysical doctrine in concrete form, and they were symbolists to the core. Another example of their method may be added to those previously given from the writings of the Naassenes. The stone, they said, which became the head of the corner, was Adamas, because the head contains the brain, the formative brain (Nous) from which all generation proceeds. This kind
of exegesis was not confined to Naassenes ; it was more or less the Gnostic method in general, and was copiously employed
by Philo. It was not of much consequence to Philo if his common sense led him to doubt the truth of some statements in the Old Testament, because he thought he could extract truth from them symbolically. The chief difference between him and most of the Gnostics in this respect was that the latter definitely rejected the Hexateuch as a revelation of the supreme God. Men of this attitude of mind could take over any myth
which they were able to adapt to their own ideas. It was not only the Old Testament to which the Naassenes applied their symbolic method of interpretation. The writings of the Greek poets and the Pagan myths were also believed by them to have a hidden meaning. Hence the question of literal truth or falsehood did not interest them, and they interpreted the death and resurrection of the Pagan cultgods in their own fashion. So far from sharing the later Christian belief that the gods were demons, they held that when the Phygians called upon Attis they were calling upon Adamas without knowing it. The Egyptians also, they maintained, worshipped Adamas under the name Osiris.
" For," said they, " the Egyptians name him the bringer of
good (agathephoros), though they do not know what it is that
they are saying " (Hipp, v, 7). A conclusion of extreme
importance can be drawn from such statements. It follows
from the Naassene acceptance of the myths of the death and



THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST 179
resurrection of Attis and Osiris that their own doctrine
included belief in the death and resurrection of Adamas —a death and resurrection which, though at first no doubt metaphorically conceived, were concretely exemplified in the myths, and would thus as time went on tend to become more
concretely represented in thought. It has been previously mentioned that in the Naassene doctrine the spiritual Adamas [= the Logos] descends into the souls of men to free
them from ignorance and vice, and is tortured and even put to death in his prison of flesh. This is a very early Gnostic doctrine of the incarnation and death of the Christ, not
peculiar to the Naassenes. In Mark three prophecies of the suffering and death of the Son of Man are put into the mouth of Jesus.1 Critical theologians do not believe that Jesus
uttered these prophecies. W. Bousset wrote :
What lies before us in the Son of Man passages of the
evangelical tradition is primarily a dogma of the community
coherent and complete in itself.2
But we have to take into consideration the different meanings
of the term Son of Man and the character of the community
in which each of them is likely to have been used. Good critics have concluded from the absence of the term from the
Pauline and other Epistles—even the comparatively late
Epistles of Clement and Barnabas —that it is not very early
in Christian doctrine. It appears to have made its entrance during the last quarter of the first century into certain circles which had come particularly under the influence of the
Jewish Apocalypses. Its wider adoption was part of the process through which Gnostic Christianity was gradually catholicized by the infiltration of elements of definitely Jewish or Palestinian origin. These conclusions refer to the apocalyptic Son of Man ; but, as we have seen, the term was used by the Naassenes at a very early date, and might there fore have been familiar to some Gnostic Christians who had
points of contact with them. In some of the passages in Mark in which the term occurs the Son of Man is the eschato
1 Mk. viii, 31 ; ix, 31 ; x, 33.
• Kyr. Chr., p. 20.



180 THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST
logical Son of Man. If, therefore, the conclusions above stated are correct, these passages are not likely to have been in the Primitive Gospel ; and this opinion agrees with critical judgment upon the passages themselves. The utterance
of Jesus before the Sanhedrin (Mk. xiv, 62), in which the
term occurs, is rejected as unauthentic by several leading
commentators ; and the " Little Apocalypse " in Mk. xiii is also not original. When further we take into account the known fact that belief in a Second Coming was alien to Gnostic doctrine, we may reasonably suspect that the only other passage in this Gospel (viii, 38) in which the term is
used in connection with a Second Coming is also not primi
tive. In two other verses the term appears in a prediction of
the " betrayal " ; and these verses are inferably late.
In Hebrew and Aramaic the term " son of man " was
commonly used periphrastically to signify " man," and good authorities are of the opinion that it sometimes appears in
the Gospels in this sense. It may have this meaning in Mk.
ii,
10 and 28. Hence an investigation of the significance which as a divine title the term may have had in an earlier and simpler form of Mark can with safety take account only of the three verses referred to above and perhaps one other.
An apocalyptic or eschatological implication must of course be excluded. The prophecies in Mark have been expanded. The
essential content of them in its primitive form can be
recovered from Mk. viii, 31
:
" The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected and be killed, and after three days rise again." The writer, although he impressed his own personality upon the Gospel, was certainly not the originator of its fundamental doctrine. The prophecy, we may safely conclude, was not invented by him
;
it
must have been the expression of an existing dogma. Now the name which the Naassenes gave to the Logos incarnate in men was
" the Son of Man." Hence before a Gospel was composed the belief existed, no doubt in written form, that the Son of
Man must suffer and be rejected and be killed. It
is
not at all unlikely that Naassene doctrine should have been reflected in an early Christian document. Close connection with the



THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST 181
Naassenes need not be assumed. Certain great ideas were floating in the religious atmosphere of the time and were absorbed and applied by religious thinkers in accordance with their own method of exposition and the dogmatic orientation of the circle in which they moved. The resurrection of the Saviour after three days was a current religious idea. Christian doctrine must have been enriched from very varied
sources. As Bousset has observed * :
A religion of so victorious a power of growing and recruiting
as Christianity took over with amazing rapidity forms of
thought of the most varied kind.
The influence of Orphism upon Christianity has been
recognized by several scholars :
Macchioro and others have drawn attention to the Orphic
elements in Christianity. The scholar named has observed :
" The Orphic belief traversed all the stages of the evolution
of the Greek folk from magic to philosophy . . . until at
last it was reformed and spiritualized through becoming
Christianity." 2
Another verse which may be of Gnostic origin is Mk. x, 45 :
" The Son of Man came not to be ministered unto but to minister, and to give his life as a ransom for many." The
word " ransom " need not imply an expiatory sacrifice. The Greek word lutron which is so translated has the general meaning of a price paid, and the more particular one of the
price of redemption. But the notion that Christ came " to
minister " does not correspond well with the activity of
Jesus as conceived in the Primitive Gospel. It is frequently instructive to go behind the English translation to the original Greek, and when we do that in the present case we find that the verb employed signifies to wait on, to serve, implying service rendered by a subordinate to his superior, which is not an appropriate description of beneficent opera tion through divine power exercised by a being who was manifestly superior to those upon whom the benefits were conferred. Here again we may reasonably suspect that a
1 Kyr. Chr., p. 39.
* Van den Bergh van Eysinga, De Werdd van het Nieuwe Testament,
p. 126.



182 THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST
phrase originally employed in connection with a different
conception of the Christ was taken into the Gospel. In the Gospel Jesus is never humiliated until the hour of his death approaches, and is never placed in a position of inferiority.
He speaks and acts " with authority " and confounds all who engage in controversy with him. Though human in form he walks among men as a god, and out of compassion he con
descends to do them good. This is not " service " in the
sense of the Greek verb diakoneo. But if we go back to the earlier Gnostic Christianity we find the conception expressed.
In the Gospel the self-humiliation of Jesus may be latent, but it is not apparent, whereas in the Pauline Epistles, for
example, it is stressed. Jesus, we are told, " took the form of a slave." The introduction of the phrase into the Gospel
is intelligible, but it is unlikely to be original there because it does not arise out of the Evangelist's presentation of the
Christ. But the idea of the " humiliation " of the Christ is
older than Paul. It is a cardinal point in the doctrine of the Naassenes, in which the Christ becomes subservient to the carnal nature in order to liberate the soul. And the death of the Christ in the irredeemably carnal man could be said to be the price paid by him for the redemption of many others.
A number of the ablest critics of the New Testament have been of the opinion that Son of Man was not a messianic title
in the first century ; and the idea that the Son of Man must suffer and be killed cannot have been derived from the Apocalypses, nor can the passages cited from Mark have been genuine utterances of Jesus. As the writer of the article
" Son of Man " in the Encyc. Bibl. has observed : " That Jesus cannot have predicted in detail his death and resurrec tion after three days, or on the third day, is evident to all critical students." The simplest solution of the problem, upon which a great deal has been written to little purpose, is
that the conception of the suffering and death of the Son of Man is of Gnostic origin, and that in the development of Christian dogma it was transformed through fusion of the Gnostic with the apocalyptic Son of Man and assimilation to an existing conviction that immortality for man could be secured only through the death and resurrection of a divine being.



THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST 183
There is evidence that other Gnostics besides the Naassenes promulgated a metaphysical doctrine of the death and resurrection of the Logos and interpreted myths in terms
of it. In a source used by Plutarch the myth of Osiris is
interpreted as follows :
Osiris is the Logos, whose forms and ideas the goddess
Isis as the female principle in nature receives into herself.
Only his spirit is imperishable, immortal ; since the knowing,
reasoning, and virtuous part is stronger than destruction and
change. But his body is frequently torn and annihilated
by Typho; in other words, all that enters this material
world from the world of ideas has, like a seal in wax, no
durability and becomes the prey of the disorderly and
destructive power of the evil element. When, however,
Typho destroys these copies of the imperishable essence,
Isis mourning takes them into herself and preserves them.1
A closer parallel is offered in a Gnostic interpretation of the myth of Attis, according to which Attis is the primitive divine creative power [= Logos] which enters into matter and works
upon it. As Attis is recalled by the mother-goddess to the heavenly world, so does the Logos oppressed by matter revive and reascend. One may say, therefore, that there was a Gnostic doctrine of the death and resurrection of the Logos, not derived directly from Greek or oriental myth. There is not only not the slightest reason for connecting the doctrine
in its origin with the death of any man ; it is most improbable
that it should have originated in that way. It is older than the Naassene Hymn, in which the Christ is individualized.
In the first century there was no authoritative dogma and no one in a position to authorize any. We read of parties of Paul, of Peter, of Apollos. These names represent varieties of Gnostic Christian thought ; but there were also the Judaic parties in Palestine and elsewhere, represented by James and
in the Apocalypse of John. All these parties must have held opinions different from the others. Various ideas and speculations concerning the Christ or the Logos were current, any of which, through one or another of the Christian sects, could have left traces upon the early Christian literature. Pete* seems to have occupied a position intermediate
1 Quoted by Bousset, Kyr. Chr., p. 166.



184 THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST
between those of Paul and James. Very little can be inferred concerning the opinions of Peter and Paul from the speeches ascribed to them in the Acts of the Apostles, which were composed by the compiler of the book with the design of assimilating as far as possible the views of the two leaders, though no doubt fragments from more ancient records may have been included. The Clementines profess to give the
doctrine of Peter, and there is no reason to suppose that it is
a mere fabrication. A connection is thus indicated between the doctrine of Peter and that of the Gnostic Ebionites.1
The Gospel of Peter has Gnostic features. It is probable that
the composer who wrote in Peter's name belonged to a
Petrine party. According to Epiphanius some of the Ebionites taught that the Christ was a spiritual being created before all things and that he had descended and appeared to the Patriarchs in the body of Adam. The doctrine ascribed to Peter in the Clementine Recognitions approximates closely to this. These Ebionites held further that the Christ, having finally invested himself in the body of Adam and appeared upon earth in the form of a man, had been crucified, had risen, and ascended. Since this Christ had not even in his human and visible shape been born, we are not moving in the region
of historical fact, and the " crucifixion " may be inferred to have had its origin in symbolism, as with the Naassenes. Adam stands as the type of humanity in which the spiritual
Christ is being perpetually ill-treated and " crucified." 2 In the Gospel of Peter Jesus and the Christ are not identified.
When Jesus is on the point of giving up the ghost he utters
the cry, " My power, my power, thou hast left me," where
power = Logos or Christ.8 Jesus himself is not a normal human being since he is incapable of suffering pain.
Apparently he was not born, for he is said to have " gone thither from whence he was sent."
1 " Peter " may be little more than a name representing a sect
with which he was —or was supposed to have been —connected.
1 In several places in the Psalms " adara " is found in the Hebrew
as a general term for " man."
3 Justin, who seems to have been restating Gnostic doctrine in a
more Catholic form, terms Jesus " Logos and Power " of God.

5. LlTERAIilZATION OF THE DOGMA
Christianity, like every great and successful popular movement, must have been a product of the aspirations and
ideals of the age in which it was born. No leader, however exceptional his genius, can create such a movement, though no doubt he can precipitate it when the conditions are ripe. The operative ideas must be there first. Leaders do not originate these ; they shape and direct them. Now we may learn what were the questions and longings which were directing men's thoughts in the first century from the per
plexity of Clement in Recog., I, 4 :
I was pondering how I could restrain myself from the
propensity to sin if the reward of righteousness were doubt
ful, especially as I do not even know for certain what the
righteousness itself which pleases God is. Neither, as I
reflected, do I know whether the soul is immortal, nor
whether it is of such a nature as to be able to hope for any
thing in the future.
Clement complains that he can get no satisfying answers to these questions from the philosophers, and what he requires is certainty. The average man, neither then nor now, will be satisfied with the assurance that certainty in such matters is unattainable. Certainty he wants and certainty he will have. No wonder that ancient myths became transformed under the pressure of such need into the Mystery -cults of Saviourgods, and no wonder that these flourished. They offered to
their devotees that for which above all things they yearned the assurance of eternal life. And the assurance was given in the most convincing manner. The Saviour-god by dying had vanquished death ; and, as he had risen again from the dead, so would his worshippers, having identified them selves with him by appropriate rites, be assured of their own resurrection, or of the continuing life of the soul when the
body had perished. In Egypt those who had died were named Osiris, and frequently an image of the god was interred with them, and over their body the following
incantation was pronounced :
As surely as Osiris lives shall he live ; as surely as Osiris
cannot die shall he also not die ; as surely as Osiris will not be annihilated, he also shall not be annihilated.

.186 THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST
In the mystic ceremonies of Attis, the worshipper became symbolically united with the god and was thus made a
partaker of his immortality. In the ritual of his death and resurrection an effigy of the god was buried, and when on the third day the sepulchre was opened and found to be empty the resurrection of the god was hailed by his worshippers as a
guarantee of their own resurrection. " Be comforted, ye
pious," said the priest; " as the god is saved so will ye be saved." The death and resurrection of Dionysus was enacted in his Mystery and the resurrection of the god was understood by those who were present as a symbolic
assurance of their own immortality. The prevalence of this intense longing for the assurance of immortality and the
competition of cults which satisfied it inevitably resulted in the assimilation of the death and resurrection of the Gnostic Christ to those of the other divine Saviours. But Clement in the Recognitions demands more than the assurance of immortality ; he desires also to know what is the righteous
ness which is pleasing to God. In this respect Christianity
had an advantage over the Pagan cults. In them, indeed, a
pure life was thought to please the god. But Christianity
could present to those who wished to live rightly a code of morals which had the authority of a divine revelation. The natural tendency to literalize metaphor must among early Gnostics have been stimulated by a passage in the Wisdom of Solomon previously referred to. The passage (Wis.
ii)
is
a description of the ignominious death of the righteous man (the Just) at the hands of the wicked, who
say:
Let us lie in wait for the righteous man because he
is
of
disservice to us, and
is
contrary to our works. He pro
fesseth to have knowledge of God and nameth himself the
servant of God. He vaunteth that God
is
his father. If
the righteous man
is
God's son he will uphold him. With
outrage and torture let us put him to the test. Let us con
demn him to a shameful death.
Gnostics, applying to this passage the method of interpreta tion which was habitual with them, could hardly fail to see in
it
a description of the death of the incarnate Logos
;
and they would find a direct incitement to probe beneath the



THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST 187
surface in verse 22, which says that the wicked " knew not the mysteries of God." The ideally righteous man was he in whom the spiritual Christ was present in the superlative degree. The righteous man of this passage is termed the servant (pais) of God and the son of God, both of them titles
of the Christ. The word translated " of disservice " is in the Greek duschrestos. Now Chrestos was employed by Gnostics as a name alternative to Christos. The meaning of the word is gracious, serviceable, or kind. One who was duschrestos to the wicked would of course be chrestos to the good. Even though accepted at first as symbolism, yet under the in fluences which have been adverted to, the picture presented by it must have tended to accelerate the literalization of the belief that the incarnate Christ had been put to death. We know from the Epistle of Barnabas that early Christians did
in fact understand this passage to be a description of the death of the Christ.1
His suffering was manifested beforehand. For the prophet
saith concerning Israel : Woe unto their soul, for they have
counselled evil counsel against themselves, saying, Let us
bind the righteous one, for he is unprofitable [duschrestos] for
us. . . . For they shall see him in that day wearing the long
scarlet robe about his flesh, and shall say, Is not this he
whom once we crucified and set at nought and spat upon ?
Verily this was he who then said that he was the son of God
(Wis. v, 2-5).
The " prophet " is Isaiah (iii, 9) ; but only the first sentence
is taken from that book ; the source of the rest of the passage is obviously Wisdom. Christians of the first century would make no distinction between such a statement as that quoted above from Wisdom and a genuine historical record.2 There is no unambiguous reference in the Odes of Solomon
to the death of the Christ, but in Ode XLII there appears to
be a reference to the righteous man of Wisdom : " My out

slew " the Just ". Tertullian also identified Christ with the righteous
man of Wisdom. Adv. Marcion, III, 22.

188 THE DEATH OF THE ;CHRIST
stretching is the outstretched wood which was set up on the
way of the Just "—or, according to another translation, " on which the Just was hung by the way." We may conclude
that the writer understood the " shameful death " to mean crucifixion ; and it seems probable that he considered the righteous man to be a special incarnation of the Christ. Or he could have taken him to be a type of the righteous in
general—in other words, of the congregation of the saints, since, as we have seen, that congregation was thought of as the visible body of the Logos. Then the persecution and martyrdom to which the con gregation or its members were exposed could be symbolically described as the persecution and martyrdom of the Christ.
In verse 1 of Ode XLII it is written : "I approached my
Lord, for the outstretching of my hands is his sign," where
" my Lord " as usual in the Odes is God. The figure is
taken from Ps. lxxxviii, 9 : " Lord, I have stretched out
my hands unto thee." And " my Lord " in this verse is a
different being from " the Just " who is mentioned later. Hence there is no reason to assume a reference to the cross of Jesus. On the contrary, the cross of Jesus is the end of an evolutionary process of thought of which we are now considering the early stages.
It is well known that the cross was a sacred symbol
among various nations long before the Christian era. In the story of the out-stretching of the arms of Moses during the
battle with the Amalekites there is evidence that it was such among the ancient Israelites. Inferably even at the date when that story was written the outstretching was the
Lord's " sign." The cross had symboUc significance in the
cult of Osiris. And, when the disciples of Mithras were baptized, the priest made upon their foreheads the sign of
the cross. In the temple of Serapis at Alexandria there was a large image of the god with arms outstretched crosswise.1 Prometheus, who, like the Logos, was regarded as a bene factor of men, was represented in a crucified posture. The
Passover Lamb, as Justin informs us, was dressed in the shape of a cross. Consequently it was hardly possible for
1 Cox, Mythology of the Ary~" Nations, 1903, p. 354.



THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST 189
early Gnostic Christians to avoid understanding the " shame
ful death " of " the Just " as crucifixion, which was the only kind of shameful death appropriate to a divine being.
Really, however, the " shameful death " of Wisdom is hardly likely to have meant crucifixion in the Roman sense. The passage was doubtless suggested by Plato's picture of the sufferings of the ideally righteous man, in which he is
said to have been " impaled." The term probably indicates a method of punishment anciently in use which consisted in the suspension of the criminal by the wrists to a post with his arms above his head. Sometimes there was a short cross-piece at the top of the post, whereby a resemblance to crucifixion was created, and the word used by Plato could be understood by later writers as signifying crucifixion. There is reason to believe that the Odist was acquainted with the writings of Plato. Some knowledge of Platonic
doctrine seems to be indicated in Ode XXXIV :
The likeness of that which is below is that which is above ;
for everything is above ; and below there is nothing, but it
is believed to be by those who have not knowledge.
Obviously people who held opinions of that kind were not bound to historical reality and might be capable of thinking
and writing of a symbolic death as if it were more real than
a physical one. And, since the argument of Plato was that the ideal Just Man must necessarily have been ill-treated and slain, when the belief was established among Gnostic
Christians that the Logos had " appeared," belief in his ignominious and yet glorious death necessarily followed. Moreover, Plato's ideal man must have been actually the
Platonic " idea " of man ; not a mere abstraction, but the supernal perfect being of whom the human race was supposed
to be a very imperfect copy, for the reason that the supernal ideal man is marred through being impressed upon matter. The Gnostic conception of the incarnate Logos was so closely
analogous to this that it would be strange indeed if they had
not identified him with Plato's Just Man.
It is thus quite comprehensible how the incarnate ChristLogos, the God in men who is continually being degraded and tortured through the imperfection of the carnal nature,



190 THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST
came to be thought of as crucified, and how the conception gradually came to be more concretely represented, until by easily intelligible stages men arrived at the idea that the perfectly righteous man in whom the Christ had become incarnate in order to bring to men the knowledge of the true God had been crucified by the wicked. Many of the beliefs, especially religious beliefs, cherished by men have had a less solid foundation than this. Since, moreover,
the perfectly righteous man, like the " wise man " of the Stoics, was an ideal man who had never been born of a
woman, his identification with the " prophet " Joshua, who
had " come again from Heaven," was a very natural step one, however, which the Catholic Christian writers of the
second century would certainly suppress. In the oldest
Christian literature the time and place of the Crucifixion are completely undefined.
6. The Quasi-Historical Details The conception of the death of the Christ having been reached, the restless and curious imagination of human beings would set to work and elaborate the picture. The fifty-third chapter of Isaiah supplied some details ; others were taken from Psalms which were supposed to be prophetic. We can learn from Justin and others that Christian writers sought for no historical evidence ; the principle upon which they worked was that every supposed prophecy must necessarily have been fulfilled. And thus the drama was built up. We could also take account of the theory of the secret cult of an ancient Palestinian god Joshua and of his sacrificial death in the form of a human victim. We might then infer that the existing narrative of the Passion was arrived at from a fusion of two representations of different character and origin. The theory in question does not,
however, come within the scope of the present work. But also in addition to the Logos-Christ there existed in Jewish religious thought the Messiah-Christ, and the identification of the two was a stage in the synthesis of Catholic doctrine. Neither in Pauline and Johannine Christianity nor in the Primitive. Gospel was the Son of God Christ the Jewish



THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST 191
Messiah. When the identification had been made it seemed to Christians one of the great tragedies of the world that, although the long-expected Messiah had come, the Jews
had refused to receive him. It may, in fact, be at first sight surprising that Christianity, which began as a Jew ish movement, afterwards made no appeal to Jews. The abrogation of the Mosaic Law through the Christ was no doubt a serious obstacle; but that is not a complete ex planation, since some Jewish Gnostics had rejected the Law ; and other Jews might have been induced to do so. The metaphysical Gnostic Christianity in its early form did
attract philosophically minded Jews, as we may learn from the Talmud; but, when the Christ had been humanized and historicized and the Jews were asked to worship a man, naturally they refused. They were not able to be convinced by Christian arguments that this man was either Son of God or Christ. They replied, as Trypho in Justin's Dialogue
replied : "Ye follow an empty rumour and make a Christ
for yourselves." " If he was born and lived somewhere he is entirely unknown."
The " righteous man " was condemned to a shameful
death. But condemnation to death implies a trial. A trial therefore had to be supplied. And by whom else should Jesus be tried but by the Jews who had rejected him ? The Gospel of Peter should be accepted as evidence that in the
earliest form of the historicized dogma Jews were the responsible agents. Previously the executioners were as
indefinite as all the other details. In the earliest strata of the Pauline Epistles, among which we may reckon Rom.
ii,
17-29
;
ix, 1-5
;
x, 1-4
;
1
Cor. x, 1-11, we can find criticism of Jews and tempered censure, but no such hostility as existed later and must have existed then
if
Jesus had really been killed by Jews, or at their instigation. Up to the year 70 the Christian sects must have been largely composed of Jews, who had as yet no idea that they were founding a new religion. Gnostic Christianity originated among men who still reckoned themselves Jews and hoped to permeate Judaism with a spiritual doctrine before which the ancient formalism must wither. The writer of Rom. ix, 1-5, and



192 THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST
x, 1, 2—a Jew himself, though certainly not Paul —gives expression to this hope without a trace of animosity. What a contrast between the sorrowful regret exhibited in these verses and the vehement anti-Jewish invective of the Fourth Gospel ! Something had plainly occurred in the meanwhile to kindle the later hostility, which consequently was not due to the crucifixion of Jesus. The Pharisees, too, during the same period were not inimical to the Jewish Gnostic sects. The statement in Acts xxiii, 9, that the Phari sees were favourable to Paul correctly illustrates the
historical situation at that time. It was the fall of Jeru salem which brought about the change of feeling by shattering the political bond of union. The Jewish leaders, believing that religious uniformity could alone preserve the
nation, became strictly legalistic and intolerant. It was not
the Christians who declared war against the Jews, but
contrariwise. The pericope, Jn. ix, is the symbolic statement of an historic fact, which, however, is antedated by the
writer. According to John the Pharisees —sc. the contem
porary Pharisees —were blind men who thought they could see ; the man blind from his birth who is made to see is the type of the Christianized Jew. He is cast out from the
Synagogue. Thus the hostility began. A natural result of that hostility was identification of the Jews with the wicked
of the Wisdom of Solomon who condemned the " righteous
man " to a shameful death. Proof that this identification was actually made is found in the passage from the Epistle of Barnabas previously quoted.
From Volkmar to Guignebert critics of the New Testament have seen that the story of the betrayal by Judas must be
fictitious. But the story is not an arbitrary invention,
although the details of it were supplied by passages in the
Old Testament— Ps. xli, 9, and lv, 12; Zech. xi, 12, 13. It was written as the symbolic statement of a fact. Loisy, when he suggested that Judas may be the personification of incredulous and false Judaism, threw a gleam of fight into the obscurity which had baffled theologians, without, however, completely illuminating it. The credit for that is due to Prof. W. B. Smith. Jesus, having been rejected by



THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST 193
the Jews, instead of being the Saviour of his own people,
became " a light to lighten the Gentiles." The passage of
thought from the idea of a metaphorical " handing over "
to that of " delivering up " in a more literal sense was very easy for Greek -speaking early Christians; for the Greek verb paradidomi has both meanings, and it also means to hand over to justice and to betray. Hence out of the thought that the Jews had given up their Messiah to the Gentiles could easily arise the idea that Jesus had been betrayed and that he had been delivered into the hands of a Gentile judge. W. B. Smith pointed out that there is a Hebrew root
S-K-R, of which the most pertinent occurrence is in Isa.
xix, 4 : "I will give over (sikkarti) Egypt into the hands of
a cruel lord." The Septuagint renders this verb sikkarti by the future of the Greek paradidomi. Iscariot therefore might
signify he who gives up, hands over, or surrenders. If the designation is artificial the case is not one for the strict application of the laws of etymology. The name Judas having been chosen for its close resemblance to Judceus, we
can find in the combination " Judas Iscariot " an embodi
ment of the notion that the " Jew " had " delivered up " Jesus to the Gentiles. There is another Hebrew root which may have helped by its appropriateness to fix the designation of Judas. The root has the significance of hiring, and occurs in the very passage of Zechariah [xi, 12] from which the item of the
thirty pieces of silver was taken. Twice in this verse occur
the words " my price " (sechari). But the notion of surren
dering was probably the operative one. If this explanation
of the meaning of the term " Iscariot " is correct, the Judas episode must be later even than Pilate in the story of the Passion. Guignebert has concluded that the Jews had nothing to do with the crucifixion of Jesus, basing his con clusion upon the historical impossibility of the narrative in
this respect. But, since the trial by Pilate is hardly less
incredible, it is inferable that there was some motive for the representation. And the motive is not likely to have been Christian hostility to the Jews, since in an earlier form of
the narrative it was the Jews themselves who carried out



194 THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST
the crucifixion.1 A possible explanation is that the story was designed, like the episode of Judas, to illustrate the surrender
of their Messiah by the Jews to the Gentiles. It may be objected that Judas did not as a matter of fact surrender
Jesus to the Gentiles. But we have to consider that the episode was devised as the symbolic representation of an
idea, and that it had somehow to be fitted into an existing narrative which already gave a more literal representation of the same idea; and the delivering up of Jesus to the
Gentiles was in fact the final result of his action. Judas, as the type of the Jews, surrendered the Christ ; that was
the important fact to be illustrated. It is worth noting, however, that in the Fourth Gospel nothing is said about the bargain made by Judas with the Jewish leaders and that Judas conducts to the garden a captain and a band of soldiers, who must have been Roman soldiers. Two different accounts seem to have been mixed up together in this Gospel. The substitution of a Gentile judge for Herod must have been motived, because difficulties were thereby created and the plausibility of the narrative was entirely destroyed. The responsibility for the death of Jesus had to remain fixed upon the Jews, and the Roman governor had to be absolved. And so we are presented with the amazing spectacle of the condemnation of an innocent man as a feeble concession to Jews by a strong ruler who in his general behaviour had shown a callous disregard for Jewish susceptibilities. But the Gospel writers were far more interested in the pre sentation of their ideas than in the probability, to say nothing of the accuracy, of their statements. Why Pilate was chosen for the part is very much a matter for conjecture.
Very likely, however, it was because he was rather a notorious person, who, at the end of his ten years' procuratorship, had
been summoned by Tiberius to Rome to answer for the arbitrary violence of which he was accused.
1 A trace of the earlier belief has been preserved in the Fourth
Gospel, xix, 16, where it is said that Pilate delivered Jesus to the
Jews to be crucified, and that they (the Jews) took Jesus. The
compositeness of the narrative appears in the subsequent statement
(verse 23) that the soldiers crucified Jesus.



THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST 105
7. The Sacked Meal
Intimately connected with the death of the Saviour-god was the sacred meal. The origin of this, no doubt, was the prehistoric cannibalistic meal at which the flesh of the theanthropic sacrificial victim was eaten. But in the Mystery cults the tendency was to pass from the physical to the
metaphysical. It was no longer thought necessary to eat the flesh of the god, since his spirit could be supposed to be present in the duly consecrated food and drink. The primitive conception, with which was bound up the idea of a redemptive sacrifice, still comes to expression in the Catholic
Sacrament as we find it represented in Matthew and Mark. But in the Teaching of the Twelve Apostles and in 1 Cor. x,
16, 17, we have earlier evidence of a Gnostic Christian
Sacrament —or rather Eucharist—from which the original crude significance has been refined away. The Gnostics, after their manner, interpreted the meal symbolically. Some of the heretical Gnostics of the second century seem to have converted their Sacrament into a magical rite, but from the passages above referred to we learn that for Gnostic Christians of the first century the partaking in common of
the sacramental meal symbolized union —union of the mem bers one with another and union of the community with the
indwelling spiritual Christ. The vine in Jn. xv, 1, is a
symbol of this unity. Jesus as " the true vine " says to his
disciples : " Abide in me and I in you." In the Mandaean
Book of John also the vine is a symbol of the unifying spirit
of the community ; the members are likened to birds which perch upon it and make their nests there. Similarly with
regard to the bread, as we read in the Didache :
Just as this broken [bread] was scattered over the hills
and became one, so let thy church be gathered from the
ends of the earth into thy Kingdom.1
These words must have been written by a Jew who had in mind fellow- Jews dispersed among the nations; not all such Jews, of course, but those who revered a divine Jesus
believed to have brought " knowledge and immortality " to
1 The " Kingdom " here is not the eschatological Kingdom.



196 THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST
men.1 We may infer a widely spread, even though not numerically important, Gnostic Jesus-cult among Jews of the Dispersion early in the first century. The sacred meal of this Jewish sect has no apparent relation to the death of Jesus. The same may be said of the sacred meal referred to in 1 Cor. x, which also signifies communion. And, bearing in mind the early Gnostic Christian doctrine of the Incarnation, we may not unreasonably conjecture that the fellowship of body and blood in these verses signifies the fellowship of the corporate community, the body of Christ, in which the spiritual Christ is incarnate. Indeed, this interpretation
may be implicit in the words of verse 17 : " Seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body." The persistence
of the term " Communion " is an indication of synthesis; for the Catholic Sacrament cannot have grown out of the
i Gnostic Eucharist. It came in along a different line and, though actually very much more ancient, its entry into Christianity was subsequent, as the documentary evidence attests. The fact that attestation of the Sacrament is later than that of the Eucharist has been recognized. Theologians on their theory can neither explain the fact nor account for
the double conception. Schweitzer, for example, wrote :
From the standpoint of the doctrine of the Apostle to the
Gentiles to speak of the body and blood of Christ is an
absurdity. It remains obscure how Paul could have brought
the account of the Sacrament which he gives in 1 Cor. x into
conformity with the historical [ ?] words of Jesus naming
the bread and wine his own body and blood, and how he could have given a common interpretation to the two conceptions.2
The plain answer of course is that he could not, and that he did not. But for Gnostics a symbol might be something more
than the expression of an idea : it might have operative
power. So, possibly, it was thought that as a result of the
1 Tho term " servant {pais) of God " docs not imply an historical
person. The Greek word can mean "son." And a mere man
could not be supposed to have brought " immortality." The
bringer of " Gnosis and immortality " was the Gnostic Logos.
2 Qeschichte der Paulinischen Forschung, p. 156. We have here
an illustration of the remarkable combination in Schweitzer of critical
acumen with theological obtuseness.



THE DEATH OF THE CHRIST 197
communion the spiritual Christ entered in fuller measure into the participants. And it is understandable that with
the influx of Pagans from the Mystery-cults there gradually arose a belief in the magical efficacy of the consecrated food, and thus the amalgamation of Sacrament and Eucharist became possible.



CHAPTER VII
PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY
1. THE PAULINE PROBLEM
N0 valuation of Pauline Christianity is possible until we have decided which of the heterogeneous doctrines embodied in the Epistles is actually Pauline. With regard to Paul himself very little that is reliable is known. For our present purpose, however, it will be sufficient, and it will be con venient, to use the name as that of the promulgator of a body of doctrine which probably in fact emanated from more
than one person. It is the doctrine of a school or of a group of allied communities. Not very much help in determining the character of the doctrine can be obtained from theological works upon the subject in general. During eighty years at
least, if we begin with F. C. Baur, an immense expenditure of learning and acuteness has resulted in no agreed solution of the Pauline problem. One may safely conclude that theolo gians have been reasoning from a false premise; otherwise so much learned labour would not have been so lamentably wasted. The course of the discussion has been recorded and acutely criticized by Schweitzer,1 with whose opinion
upon its general character it is impossible not to agree :
Theologians operate ever with the old presuppositions.
. . . The result is in every respect unsatisfying. The solu
tion remains as impossible as before, and the simplifications
which are thought to have been achieved in the statement of
the problem result only in new difficulties.
The extraordinary thing is that Schweitzer himself has
not seen what presupposition it is that persistently falsifies the argument, although he has laid his finger upon it over and over again. The principal difficulty in which criticism has been floundering is, as he points out, that it has been
1 Gesch. der Paul. Forsch. 198



PAULINE AND JOHANNINE- CHRISTIANITY 199
compelled to recognize in the Epistles a double doptrine
one juridical, grounded upon the thought of justification, and the other ethical, governed by the idea of sanctificatione-and has not been able to show how the two are connected and how they can be unified.1 But there are also subsidiary contradictions which the critics by subtle and verbose
reasoning endeavour to explain away. A method much in
vogue is the subjective one of forming a conception of Paulinism and then bringing into prominence those passages
which confirm it, while keeping inconvenient passages as far as possible in the background or arbitrarily construing them in' a more favourable sense. The essential duality of the doctrine of the Pauline Epistles was first clearly noted by Lipsius (1853), with whom began'the long-continued effort to unify it. Schweit zer’s criticism is that Lipsius tones down one of the doctrines in favour of the other and makes a superficial welding of the two by skilfully chosen expressions. He was followed by Liidemann (1872), who pointed out that in the Epistles
there are not only two conceptions of “ flesh ” but also two
“ anthropologies " with which are respectively connected two different doctrines of “redemption.” Liidemann’s
solution was that the “ ethical-physical ” (Hellenistic) is
Paul’s “ real view, which merely tolerates the proximity of
the other and tends to supplant it ” in proportion as the
writer goes more deeply into the essential nature of things.
Pfleiderer (1887) disagreed with Liidemann, holding that
both views had from the outset equal value in the conscious ness of the Apostle. He practically renounced the attempt to solve the psychological problem involved in his conclusion,
saying that nothing remains but to admit that in Paul’s consciousness the two different conceptions lay together unreconciled, and that he passed over from the one to the other without feeling the contradiction ! Needless to say, a
conclusion which was nothing but a confession of failure has
not been acceptable to theological critics in general. The explanation mostly favoured by Pfleiderer’s successors is
that Paul’s religious outlook underwent a gradual change.
1 Work cited, p. 9.



200 PAULINE JOHANNIN'E CHRISTIANITY
The explanation does not explain that which most needs explaining—viz., the juxtaposition of both doctrines fully developed in the same Epistle. Pfleiderer did at all events recognize the fact that the two main doctrines are completely intermingled. Schweitzer’s comment is :— .
One almost gets the impression that the assumption of
successive phases is intended pre-eminently- to serve the
purpose of slurring over the question of the inner unity of
the doctrines. Critics express no astonishment at the
efiortless manner in which the writer passes over from the
one series of ideas to the other. At the conclusion of each
of these works one is obliged to ask oneself whether the
author really expects the reader to regard what is offered
as the resentation of a system which ever existed in the
brain of a man of the earliest Christian period.1
The final observation seems to show that Schweitzer had some inkling of a fact which strongly impressed van Manen
viz., that from the year 30 to the date of Paul there had not been suflicient time for the growth of doctrines so diverse and
so highly elaborated. It is, however, not necessary with van Manen to relegate the Epistles in their entirety to'the
second century, since we know that the origin of Gnostic or Hellenistic Christianity antedates the beginning of the Christian era.
‘'
Another problem hitherto unsolved is presented by the Pauline eschatology, which is in flagrant opposition to the
Gnostic doctrine of the antithesis of spirit to flesh—an opposition extremely embarrassing to those- critics who maintain that the Gnostic doctrine is genuinely Pauline.
But those who, like B. Weiss (1886), stress the eschatology
and believe it to be the starting-point of Paul’s preaching
cannot make ' clear any orderly process of development.
Kabisch (1893) accordingly renounced the attempt to explain
the contradiction by assuming a process of development in
the thought of Paul, and tried to get rid of it by asserting
that whenever Paul wrote of death and resurrection he meant physical death and resurrection, which is decidedly not the case ; moreover, there are passages in which a
1 Work cited, pp. 26, 28.



PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY 201
" resurrection " in the generally accepted sense of the term is implicitly denied. Schweitzer observes that according to some of the investigators along these lines the doctrine of
Paul consists of a " present " and a " future " theology between which there is no inner connection. The existence of these two theologies in the Epistles is, however, a fact, and no one has succeeded in reconciling them. Brandt (1893), in direct opposition to Kabisch, maintained that
Paul regarded his conversion as " a death and resurrection of his inner man." Such a view of death and resurrection
cancels eschatology. It is the Gnostic view of the Odes of
Solomon from which eschatology is entirely absent. Holtzmann (1897) carefully reviewed the work of his
predecessors and endeavoured by a critical appraisement of the results obtained in the light of his own studies to demon strate a consistent Pauline Christology. Schweitzer's judg ment is that he, like the others, is driven into mere descrip tions in Pauline phraseology and is practically unable to explain anything. Holtzmann finds the key to Paulinism in the story of Paul's conversion, developing therefrom a psychological theory in vague and rhetorical language. But, as a matter of fact, no doctrine in the Epistles is founded by the writer upon an individual emotional experience.
In Rom. in to v, and vii, 7-25, we have a closely reasoned argument with much show of logic, and the appeal to per sonal experience is quite general and capable of finding a
response in the consciousness of anybody. In other sections we have a doctrine of redemption which is not logically reasoned out but presented as intuitively known through that super-sensual kind of knowing which is Gnosis. The doctrine is not, in essentials, peculiar to Paul. Holtzmann differs from some other critics in denying that Paul was a Gnostic. Schweitzer, on the other hand, asserts that the whole character of his system shows him to have been such ; but how can anyone who understands what Gnosticism really is believe that the chapters of Romans referred to above were written by a Gnostic ? Holtzmann was probably aware of the irreconcilability of much of the doctrine with the Gnostic view of redemption, and made the denial in the interest of his
o—o.c.



202 PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY
method of accommodation —arguing, for example, that the union with Christ in the Pauline theory of baptism is merely symbolic. That is a forced interpretation not justified by
the text, as some other commentators have seen—e.g., Titius (1900) and Heitmuller (1903)— the latter of whom 1
declares that the mystical union which is accomplished in
baptism between the believer and Christ is a " physical
hyperphysical " union and has for its consequence that the former actually participates in the death and resurrection of
the latter. If we substitute for Heitmiiller's rather evasive
expression the word " spiritual," this is the plain meaning of the passage (Rom. vi, 3-6), which expresses the Gnostic
view of " resurrection "—a view which is emphasized in
verse 13 : " Present yourselves unto God as alive from the
dead." A second, future, resurrection is excluded. Neither 1 Cor. xv nor the eschatological sectidns of the Epistles can have been written by this Gnostic. Holtzmann's procedure in this case is typical. The admission of a contradiction is shirked by asserting that Paul in a certain passage must not be understood to mean what is actually said, because that would be inconsistent with what is said else where. Another method of self-deception exemplified by Holtzmann is the ostensible harmonization of a deep-rooted difference by one of those vague phrases which merely
serve as a cloak for insufficiency, such as " the coincidence of a national attitude of mind with a Greek form of thought." The work of Holtzmann was not accepted by critical theo logians as a satisfactory solution of the Pauline problem. Bruckner (1903) and Wrede (1904) argued that Paulinism
cannot be explained as a development of the teaching of Jesus, and the former traced it to the Jewish eschatology as exemplified in the Apocalypses of Esdras and Baruch. This conclusion was strongly challenged by Olschewski (1909), who objected that the writers previously mentioned had not
explained " the peculiar combination of Christology with pneumatology which is so specifically Pauline," and en deavoured to do so himself by spinning a psychological theory

PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY 203
out of the story of Paul's conversion — a favourite device, for by enveloping the difficulties in a cloud of words theolo gians are able to persuade themselves that so remarkable a spiritual experience can be made accountable for the pro mulgation of any sort of paradoxical doctrine by the subject
of it. But the principles of sound criticism require that the steps by which the passage was made from a certain doc trine to another quite incompatible doctrine should be demonstrated and made chronologically and psychologically conceivable. By Bruckner, however, an important advance was initiated and the problem stated in new and more scientific terms. His own conclusions were inadequate and constituted no solution of the problem, because he applied his method only partially through giving undue prominence to the eschatology of the Epistles. But the way which he opened has been pursued to better purpose by Reitzenstein and Bousset.
In the view of these writers the problem is not that of the psychology of a single mind, but is to be solved by application of the principles of the scientific study of religions. Bousset argues that some at least of the most characteristic Pauline doctrine was already that of the communities to which he wrote; and Reitzenstein has traced analogies between Paulinism and the religious ideas of the Mystery-cults and of the Hermetic literature. Both these writers, however, have found it necessary in the application of their method to be selective, and have not accounted for the double aspect of the Pauline soteriology. Reitzenstein, it is true, has attempted to explain the Pauline eschatology in the same manner as the Pauline mysticism ; but Schweitzer con clusively contended against him that Jewish eschatology has no analogue in the Pagan mysticism. On this side
Bruckner had the clearer vision. In fact, anyone who maintains that Paul was a Gnostic or a Mystic is exposed to confutation by every objector who brings forward passages which no Gnostic or Mystic can have written. The eschato logy and the mysticism are as immiscible as oil and water. Reitzenstein in continuing the attempt to explain the doctrines of the Epistles without accounting for their hetero

geneous character exposed himself to the criticism of
Schweitzer, who wrote :
The Apostle is at the standpoint of strict predestination ;
for those who are " called " salvation necessarily follows ;
those who are not called can never, and by no means, attain
it. An analogy to this conception fans in the Mystery religions.1
It ought indeed to be evident that the conception could not possibly exist in the same order of religious ideas as the Pauline doctrine that everyone who is willing can become spiritual and a new creature by mystical union with the*
Christ —a doctrine which is laid down in perfectly unam biguous terms in Rom. vi, 2b-13. The theory of baptism
outlined in this section would have no sense if some men were predestined to destruction. Thus no solution of the Pauline problem is attainable until theologians are ready to admit that the Epistles are composite. Bousset 2 has already
declared that the problem is insoluble, as of course it is on the lines on which the critics have been working for the past eighty years. But sooner or later the truth will dawn upon them ; and then perhaps the value of the work of the Dutch school will be recognized. Van Manen, like all pioneers, did not always follow the right road, and the exposure of his errors can be made to pass as a refutation of his thesis as a
whole ; but it will not always be so. Theology has travelled far during the last hundred years, and is capable of travelling farther. Proof of stratification in the Epistles proceeds not only from the recognition of differences of doctrine, but also from
that of differences of style. It is as impossible that the
writer of Rom. iii-v; vii, 7-25; ix, 14-24; xi, 1-12, should have also written Rom. i, 18-27 ;
ii,
17-29
;

accompanied by a very characteristic and individual literary style found elsewhere only in short interpolations which are
as palpable as pebbles in clay, and in some Epistles—e.g.,
2 Cor. —are not found at all, the only logical conclusion is that the sections in question have been inserted into a
previously existing document. It is possible to show by a careful examination and comparison of style and doctrine that in each of the principal Epistles a Gnostic document is embedded and that these documents form the oldest strata of the respective Epistles. An approximate reproduction of the Gnostic substratum of the four Epistles is subjoined in
Appendices B to E to this book.1
2. Jewish " Mysteries "
It is an easy matter for Schweitzer and others who dis like Reitzenstein's conclusions to criticize them in detail and to show that direct dependence of Paulinism upon
the Mystery-cults is unlikely. But community of religious ideas is demonstrable. Reitzenstein's analysis, moreover, is defective through his not having taken account of preChristian Jewish Gnosticism. There were Jewish as well as Pagan Mysteries ; the systems of the Essenes, the Therapeuts, and doubtless of other Jewish sects may be so charac
terized. It is certain that the Essenes revered the Sun. This reverence may have had its origin in Sun-worship, but for the Essenes no doubt the Sun was a symbol, and the interpretation of the symbol was a part of their Mystery. An affinity between the Essenes and some early Christian communities is proved by Pliny's letter to Trajan in which
it is said that the Christians in Bithynia sang hymns to Christ at sunrise. The sacred meal of these sects must also
have been of the nature of a Mystery. In various sects a mystical significance was attributed to a certain kind of food. There is, for example, evidence in early Christian literature that fish was eaten as a sacred symbol. Such practices are
1 Detailed proof of the approximate correctness of the reconstruc
tion is given in my book, A Critical Analysis of the Four Chief Pauline
Epistles.



206 PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY
characteristic of a Mystery religion. After reading Philo's
description of the sacred meal of the Therapeuts it is hardly
possible to doubt that it was a Mystery. It was solemnized only once a year, on the fiftieth day, with a most impressive ceremonial and the singing of hymns. Since the food,
though in itself of an ordinary kind, is described as " most
holy," it must have had symbolic significance of sanctifying efficiency. The meal was followed by a ritual ceremony which must also have been symbolic. The principal feature of it was the formation of two choirs, one male, the other female, who sang alternately, and finally together as one. Philo describes the united choir as a representation of the choir of Israelites which was headed by Moses and Miriam
after the passage of the Red Sea. It is not quite clear whether the comparison was made by Philo himself or whether he is recording the intention of the Therapeuts.
The latter is probable because it is likely that he had some ground for his statement and because Jewish Mystics symbolically described the transformation from carnal to spiritual as a deliverance from Egypt. Philo himself em ployed that imagery. And the Peratai derived their name from a Greek verb meaning to pass through, because they claimed to have passed by means of their Gnosis from the bondage of carnal impulses into spiritual life as the Israelites had passed from Egypt through the Red Sea. Now mystics, such as from Philo's description the Therapeuts were, be lieved that spiritual transformation was wrought or assisted by the performance of some symbolic act. Since the annual religious ceremony of the Therapeuts, and especially the choirs, must have had a meaning of that kind, it is highly probable that the interpretation given by Philo was the true one. The ceremony, we may conclude, was essentially a
Mystery. And, as the theosophical system of the Therapeuts
was inferably near akin to Philo's own, it is quite likely that in the Mystery Moses and Miriam symbolized the Logos and Sophia. The Pauline baptism was certainly a Mystery, and so probably was the sacred meal referred to in 1 Cor. x. The
word " mystery " occurs several times in the Pauline Epistles,



PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY 207
and there was evidently esoteric doctrine reserved for the highest grade of initiates in the Christian, as in the preChristian Jewish Gnostic, communities. That must be the explanation of the statement in Mk. iv, 11, which has so severely exercised the minds of theologians. The same religious atmosphere which converted certain Pagan myths into Mysteries also favoured the birth and growth of Mysterycults among the Jews. Some of the Hermetic literature, as Reitzenstein has proved, was in existence early in the first century, and acquaintance with contemporary religious ideas may have exercised a formative influence upon the thought
of Paul. It seems reasonable to suppose that he was to some degree an innovator, but Bousset is surely right in his
opinion that Paulinism in its main features —and by Paulin
ism I mean the Gnostic doctrine of the Epistles—must already have been the theory and practice of the com munities for which he wrote. And these communities, we may infer, were strongly Hellenized communities of Jewish mystics, with an admixture of Greeks. The resemblances between Paulinism and the religious ideas of contemporary Pagan Mystery-cults reflect the prevalent thought and aspi rations of the time. The differences upon which Schweit zer lays so much stress in his criticism of Reitzenstein are the result of difference of origin, Jewish on the one hand, Greek and oriental on the other.
3. Union with the Saviour
Schweitzer observes that the term " Saviour-god " signi fies a god who came into the world for the sake of men, died, and rose from the dead, and argues that, since the Jesus of Paul is not a god, the supposed analogy between Paulinism and the Mystery-cults is false. Monotheistic Jews could not, of course, think of the Christ as a second god, but the analogy is not destroyed because in the one case the divine being who came to earth and died for men was a god and in the other the Son of God ; the essential and really vital conception was the same. Both in the Mystery-cults and in Pauline Christianity eternal life was believed to be ensured



208 PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY
through a mystical union with the divine Saviour. In neither was the death of the Saviour regarded as an ex piatory sacrifice. Such a conception is foreign to early
mysticism. The central idea of the Pauline doctrine —viz.,
immortality through union with Christ —is traceable to the
Odes of Solomon, in which we read that : " He that is joined
to him who is immortal will also himself become immortal.
. . . This is the Spirit of the Lord " ; and the Spirit of the
Lord is the Word : " Life we receive in his Christ " ; and
in Ode XLI : " His Word is with us all our way, the Saviour
who makes alive." It even appears that in the Pauline
doctrine also the Christ is " the Spirit of the Lord." For in
1 Cor. i, 5, believers are told that "in everything ye were enriched in him [Christ Jesus], in all utterance and all
knowledge." But later on we learn that it is from the
Spirit of God that the enrichment comes. " Unto us God revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searcheth all
things, yea, the deep things of God " (1 Cor.
ii,
10). Com
parison of this verse with one in Ode XVI — " The Word of the Lord searches out the unseen thing and scrutinizes his
thought "—shows that the " Spirit " of the Epistle
is
the
" Word " of the Ode. In the next verse the statement
is
even more categorically made
:
" The things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God." Hence the Christ who enriches in divine knowledge (Gnosis) and reveals the hidden
things of God must be also " the Spirit of God." Again, in Rom. viii,
9,
we read
:
" Ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit,
if
so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you "
;
and the indwelling Spirit
is
the Christ with whom the believer
is
mystically united. In
2
Cor. iii, 17, the identification
is
quite unambiguously made
:
" Now the Lord
is
the Spirit."
The verse
is
not part of the Gnostic Epistle, but the doctrine of the section
is
on the whole Pauline. And in the Gnostic Epistle itself the identity seems to be implied in verses
5
and
17
:
" God gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit. Wherefore
if
any man
is
in Christ he
is
a new creature."
1
1
In Justin's Christology, which had not been completely Catholic
ized, the Holy Spirit
is
declared with emphasis to be no other than
the Logos (Apol.,
I,
33).



PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY 209
The union between the mystic and the indwelling Christ is
here expressed as the being " in Christ." The same duplex view of the union is found in the Odes, where not only does
the Word dwell " in man," but also " he was reckoned like
me that I might put him on." And in both the Odes and the Gnostic Epistles those who receive the Spirit, who is the
Son, become sons of God themselves. " As many as are led
by the Spirit of God these are sons of God " (Rom. viii, 14) ;
and " The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit
that we are children of God " ; the meaning of which is that through union with the divine Spirit who is the Son of God the pneumatic man acquires the conviction that he is also a son. Another objection raised by Schweitzer is that in the Pagan
cults the mystic union was regarded as a " deification."
Naturally that was a view of it which Jewish Gnostics could not take ; but in so far as a man was pneumatic he partook of the divine Spirit and so became in a certain sense divine.
The comparison reveals analogies of religious ideas. It is
beside the mark to deny identity. Of course there were differences of structural growth corresponding with the difference of soil. To prefer the Christian conception is reasonable enough. The Gnostic writer distinguishes be tween the carnal and the pneumatic man, as did Gnostics in general ; but the distinction no more involves the theological doctrine of Predestination than does the philosophic opinion that conduct is determined by character. Character can be changed and the sinner become virtuous. Even the most thoroughgoing Determinism is not the same thing as the theological doctrine of Predestination. Doubtless Gnostics believed that the carnal nature of some men is such that they cannot become spiritual, but they would have repudiated the
idea that God had ordained it so. Their God was incapable of willing anything evil.
4. The Pauline Baptism
Schweitzer observes that Christians were baptized in the name of Jesus, whereas there is no evidence of a baptism in



210 PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY
the name of Osiris, Attis, or Mithras. That again is a super ficial distinction. Baptism no doubt was rather markedly a characteristic of Christian sects, derived from the practice
of earlier Jewish Mystics. But baptism in the name of Jesus is not the outcome of a fundamental difference of
religious ideas. It is explicable from the Christian attitude, inherited from Judaism, towards Paganism. There is no evidence that in the pre-Christian Jewish sects baptism was practised in the name of a divine person ; but Christians in
connecting the name of Jesus with it were not doing some thing for which no analogy in Paganism can be found. There is sufficient evidence of the utterance of a divine name, and of the magical effect supposed to be produced by it, in Pagan cults and in Gnostic formulas of conjuration. The pronouncement of the divine name was believed to be a protection against the attacks of evil supernatural powers. Belief in the existence of malevolent daemons was universal among early Christians and they used the name Jesus for the quelling of these daemons just as the Pagans used divine
names for a similar purpose. But Christians asserted that the Pagan deities themselves were daemons and that they gained entrance into the bodies of those who ate meat which had been offered to an idol. Every Pagan, in fact, was supposed to be possessed by a daemon who had to be expelled before a proselyte could be admitted into the Church. And
since it was thought that the expulsion could be effected by pronouncing the name Jesus, or, later, by reciting the trinitarian formula, baptism was practised in this name, or
these names. In Recog. II, 71 Peter is reported to have
said :
Everyone who has at any time worshipped idols, and
those whom the Pagans call gods, or has eaten of their
sacrifices, does not lack an unclean spirit. For he has
partaken of that daemon whose image he has formed in his
mind, and he therefore needs the purification of baptism in
order that the unclean spirit may go out of him.
This quotation may be supplemented by one from Justin
(DM. 85) :



PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY 211
For by the name of him, this Son of God and first-begotten
of all creation . . . every daemon exorcised is conquered and subdued.
Schweitzer's dealing with the text is quite uncritical ; he takes no account even of interpolations which other theolo gical commentators have recognized ; and he founds much of his argument against Reitzenstein upon sections which Paul certainly never wrote. The sacraments in the Mystery religions are always more than symbols ; the symbol is operative, and mystically produces the consecrating effect
which it imitates. So do the Pauline sacraments. Schweit zer, however, points to 1 Cor. vi, 11, and argues that the double interpretation of baptism as on the one hand a
" washing " and a " sanctification " and on the other as a mystical union with the Christ is an irrationality which has no parallel in the Mystery-cults, the former interpretation
being also comparatively superficial. But we are not obb'ged to charge Paul with irrationality and superficiality; there
is an alternative —viz., recognition of the fact that two conceptions so fundamentally different cannot have existed together in the same mind. Schweitzer is quite right in saying that union of the two views would be irrational. The immersion in baptism simulates a burial and the emergence a resurrection; and that is a "mystery," for the symbol
works. " Washing " is an incongruous idea, since the old man with all his sins was believed to have died and to have
risen a " new creature," pneumatic instead of carnal. The becoming pneumatic was a necessary condition of im mortality, for, as in the Wisdom and Odes of Solomon, there
is no resurrection of the body. The true Pauline doctrine of
immortality is stated in 2 Cor. v, 1-4 ; it is that immediately upon the dissolution of the body the spirit of the pneumatic
man is clothed in a heavenly psychic " tabernacle." This
passage is conclusive on the point ; but it is supported by
others —e.g., Rom. viii, 13, " if ye live after the flesh ye must
die,"—which implies that there is no death for the " sons of
God," and no future life for the " flesh." Just as in Wis.
iii, 2, so Paul could have said of the righteous : " In the eyes
of the foolish they seem to have died " ; but their apparent



212 PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY
death is liberation from the perishable garment of the spirit, while the life of the spirit is eternal and unbroken. Schweitzer as a result of his defective analysis of the Epistles is able in his criticism of Reitzenstein to choose, as others have done, the passages which suit his argument. And of course he can find evidence of belief in a future resurrection. But Paul's doctrine is the Gnostic doctrine that the pneu
matic man has already " risen from the dead." 1 The doctrine of the Mystery-cults was similar. Paul did not derive it from them, though the machinery may have been suggested by the religious ideas prevailing at the time. Schweitzer raises the objection that in the Mystery-cults
the pneumatic regeneration was regarded as a " re-birth," whereas in Paulinism it is a resurrection. The difference of view may legitimately be held to prove that there was not
direct borrowing by Paul; but obviously the essential idea is the same, albeit expressed in different terms. Another point of difference to which Schweitzer draws attention is
that in the theory of the Mystery-cults the spiritual " trans
figuration " of the living man is attained after he has received divine essence into himself through Gnosis and the vision of the god, whereas in Paulinism the spiritual union with Christ in baptism comes first and Gnosis with all that is therein
implied follows. If Schweitzer's intention was to demon strate the originality of Paulinism he has not succeeded, for in the Odes of Solomon spiritual union with the Word is the
primary condition of salvation ; and the Pauline doctrine is even much older than the Odes. According to the Orphic belief man must atone for his earthly life through suffering
and dying with the god. In the ceremony of initiation a symbolic death and rebirth was enacted; after which apparently there followed a rite in which the initiate became a child of the goddess Persephone through sucking the milk upon which her son Dionysus had been nourished.2 Cer
1 Cp. also Ephos. ii, 5 : " God, . . . even when we were dead
through our trespasses, quickened us together with Christ, and
raised us up with him." The doctrine of 1 Cor. xv seems to be a
compromise between orthodox Catholic doctrine and the primitive
Pauline.
2 Van den Bergh van Eysinga, work cited, p. 125.



PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY 213
tainly Paulinism was not a copy of any contemporary cult
observance ; but characteristic features of it are found in most of them.
5. Importance of the Hermetic Literature
The importance of the Hermetic literature consists in the
proof it affords of the prevalence of a certain type of Gnostic theosophy in the first century. This theosophy came to expression in different forms according to the religious or philosophic mentality of those who were influenced by it, thus linking together systems as diverse as Neo-Pythagoreanism
and Pauline Christianity. In the prominent position occupied by, and the character ascribed to, Nous and Logos we can trace an affinity between a Gnostic system like that of the Naassenes, the Hermetic literature, and Paulinism. The term Christ, being specifically Jewish, is naturally found only in the Jewish Gnostic sects ; but the Nous-Logos of the Hermetic literature corresponds with the Gnostic Logos, who is also the Christ of the Jewish Gnostics. The Naassene Nous was a product of the action of contemporary thought upon the Wisdom of the Wisdom literature and is distinct from Logos.1
In Poimandres the Logos, the Son of God, is said to have issued from Nous. The Naassene doctrine, in which the distinction between Nous and Anthropos is very indefinite,
approximates to this. In the Naassene Hymn, which is early though not primitive, Hermetic influence is clearly perceptible.
For the Hymn begins : " The first Nous was the genetic law of the whole. And the second was the poured out chaos
of the first-born." 2 And in Poimandres we read : " The
god Nous begat the second demiurgic Nous." Then, it is said, the second Nous, having been united with the Logos, produced the hyle, the primeval matter. Afterwards Nature (Physis) brought forth irrational living things from the elements.
1 It is not meant by this statement that the Naassenes founded
their system directly upon the Wisdom of Solomon. In the develop
ment of Jewish Gnostic theosophy the Hellenic Nous became assimi
lated to " Wisdom " regarded as the " mind " of God.
* The text of the second clause is probably corrupt.



214 PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY
In Paulinism Wisdom and Logos have been fused together
to form the Christ ; as we read in 1 Cor. i, 24, " Christ the
power of God and the wisdom of God." In Ode XXXII the
Word is equated with " the holy power of the Most High,"
and in the Gospel of Peter " power " is synonymous with
the Christ incarnate in Jesus. Between Paulinism and the Hermetic literature we find kinship of ideas rather than direct dependence. The Nous of the Hermetic books, like the Word of the Odes of Solomon and the Christ-Logos of the
Naassenes, though written of as a person, is a spiritual supernatural power, whose dwelling is the pious and pure, to whom he brings Gnosis and the mastery over the impulses of the carnal nature, precisely as does the indwelling Christ of Paul. And we are reminded of a passage in the Wisdom of Solomon and of some of the Odes when we read of
the pneumatic men—those who possess Nous —who stand opposed to the world, misjudged, oppressed, and persecuted.
The Gnostic and Pauline terminology —pneuma, psyche,
and sarx—is conspicuous; but the sacramental aspect of the religion is less prominent than with Paul. There is, however, reference to a sacrament, and in one place (Corp.
Herm., IV, 4) a baptism with Nous is mentioned. Carnal men
are supposed to become the prey of a misleading and avenging
daemon, who corresponds with " the Corrupter," " the
Destroyer," " the Dragon " of the Odes of Solomon, and the
" god of this world " of the Pauline Epistles. The " god of
this world " is not, however, a daemon in the ordinary signification of the term, nor is he Satan, for Satan is an evil
angel—a daemon if you like—who has never been held to be a god. The Pauline god of this world is apparently the creator of it, to whom its imperfections are to be ascribed,
since we are told (Rom. viii, 20) that " the creation was
subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but through him
who subjected it." The statement involves the Pauline and Gnostic belief in the intrinsic imperfection of matter, for which Satan could not be made responsible, though its creator might be. The Pauline dualism is thus at a stage beyond that of the earliest Jewish Gnostics.



PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY 215
6. The Archons
Connected with the popular »belief in daemons was the belief, derived from the East, in the existence of seven
" Archons "—spiritual beings who correspond with the seven planetary bodies, sun and moon being included. The
Gnostics termed them " Archons of this aeon." In the first century they had come to be regarded as evil and tyrannical,
since they were supposed —as by some the planets still are to rule the destiny of men (heimarmene) and hence to be the
cause of all their misfortunes. They were also supposed to obstruct the soul in its journey to Heaven. So far as Gnostics had a doctrine of predestination it was that of the astrological predestination of heimarmene. From this tyranny, however, men could be liberated by Nous, or the Logos, or the Christ, and the liberation was believed by Christian Gnostics to be effected in some manner, not explicitly defined, through the
death of the Christ. A possible explanation is that the Christ died voluntarily as a ransom, whereby he obtained from the Archons the liberation of all those who confessed him and became united with him. The explanation involves the supposition that the Archons expected the Christ, whose power they dreaded, to remain dead. And by killing him they condemned themselves, for they had gone beyond what was permissible for them as rulers of the cosmos. Another possible explanation is that the Christ, when he descended through the celestial spheres, took the form of a man, so that the Archons did not recognize him and thus incurred the guilt of the slaying of the Son of God. This kind of tricking of the evil one is a favourite theme in folk-lore. Bousset accepts the explanation in so far as he writes in reference to 1 Cor.
ii,
8,
and Col.
ii,
15
:

Through his death on the cross Christ stripped the prin
cipalities and powers [the Archons] of their weapons and
triumphed over them openly.1
But evidently a triumph through death requires some further explanation; the triumph would not have been complete without a resurrection
;
and this seems to involve
1
Kyr. Chr., p. 142.



216 PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY
the tricking of the Archons. The explanation satisfactorily clears up the obscurity of 1 Cor.
ii,
7,
8
:

We speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that
hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the
aeons unto our glory; which none of the Archons of this
aeon knew; for had they known
it
they would not have
crucified the Lord of Glory.
The Archons are referred to again in Rom. viii, 38,
Eph. vi, 12, and elsewhere. In the latter verse the Greek
word translated " world-rulers "
is
kosmokratoras, a regular Gnostic term for the Archons. Most probably also the reference in Gal. iv,
8
— " they who by nature are no gods "

is
to these Archons. The " bondage " from which Christ
liberated the Christian was double —the bondage of the
Mosaic Law and hzimarme.nl. The word " rudiments "
(elements) —Greek stoicheia
is
another name for them and
for the planets with which they were connected. In the Testament
of
Solomon there
is
mention of " seven spirits fair to look upon .
.
. those which are called stoicheia, the kosmokratores of this cosmos." To each of these
is
given the name of a sin. This identification of the Archons with sins would evidently have been capable of giving rise to the idea that the spiritual Christ who
is
put to death in the soul of a
wicked man had been killed by the Archons. But of course the idea of a conflict between the good and evil forces in the universe and the temporary success of the evil
is
a very
ancient one. It
is
likely that in Gal. iv, 10, there
is
reference to Jewish observances; but the days of the week were connected with the planets, and the months with the
zodiacal constellations —also spiritual beings. Many Jews, even Pharisees, believed that in each planet resided an
angel and
a
demon who exerted an influence over the lives of men
;
and the Preaching
of
Peter reproaches the Jews
for " serving " [= worshipping] sun and moon, which, of
course, were stoicheia. Jews in the first century were by no
means exempt from superstition —not to mention Christians
who had been Pagans —and
it
was easy to connect Jewish ceremonial observance of seasons with Pagan reverence for

the daemonic powers which were supposed to govern those seasons.1 And when we learn from an old Jewish book that the letters of the Hebrew alphabet were personified as rulers of planets, constellations, and seasons, we realize that there were religious speculations, and possibly even cults, in Jewry of which we hear nothing in the Talmud. The variety of Christian doctrine at the end of the
first century being inconsistent with the supposition that it developed uniformly along a single line, the dogma of the death of the Christ was no doubt worked out differently in different circles. Paul was not the originator of the idea that the Christ had been killed by the Archons. The verses quoted above from 1 Cor. make it clear that the belief expressed was the established belief of the community for which he wrote. As the Archons are of astral origin, so also may the
" crucifixion " have been ; for in an astronomical chart the sun is apparently crucified upon the intersecting lines of the equator and the ecliptic at the moment of his descent into the lower hemisphere, the hemisphere of darkness and death ; and is so again at the moment of his resurrection into the hemisphere of light and life ; while the period of transit is three days. The sun, of course, was worshipped
long before he became one of the seven Archons. At the time when the myth of the death of the Sun-god originated, the sun, being in the constellation Aries at the Spring equinox, was identified with the Ram. That is the Lamb
which had been " slain from the foundation of the world." The custom of dressing the paschal lamb in the shape of a cross is referable to the same myth. Obviously the scene of the killing of a spiritual Christ by malevolent spiritual Archons was not anywhere upon the earth ; and there is nothing in the Pauline Gnostic Epistles which need be understood as implying an individual in carnation. Since the Spirit of God, according to Paul, is incarnate in all pneumatic people, the statement (Rom. viii,
3) that God sent his Son in the likeness of sinful flesh may

218 PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY
have the same meaning as the statement in the Odes of
Solomon that " he was reckoned like me that I might put
him on." Docetism, however, cannot be excluded, because
the Greek word for " likeness " is homoiotes, which means
similitude and thus by implication excludes identity. In
neither case is it supposed that the Christ actually became
flesh. In Phil,
ii,
6-8, again, where
it
is
said that Christ,
" being in the form of God . . . emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men," and was
found " in appearance as a man," the implication of the words excludes the idea that the Christ literally became
man. The phrase " taking the form of a slave "
is
reminiscent of the Sethian Logos. Docetism
is
more strongly suggested by this passage than the former one; for the Greek word
translated in the English versions " fashion "
is
schema, which, according to the Greek lexicon, signifies form, outward appearance opposed to the reality, a mere show, look, mien, etc. The two passages may not have been written by the same man. Whichever interpretation of the second passage be adopted, we have no right to attribute to a writer who thus describes the descent of a divine being in the form of a man the belief that he was born of a woman. The Pauline statement that he who receives the Spirit of
God becomes " a new creature " illustrates some phrases in the Odes which, as was previously argued, have been mis understood. When the Odist wrote
:
"
I
have been delivered
from vanity ...
I
received the face and fashion of a new
person "
;
" all those will be astonished that see me, for from another race am
I
"
;
and similar phrases, he was not, as some critics have imagined, quoting the Christ; he was affirming in poetical and somewhat hyperbolic language his conviction that as a spiritual child of God he had become
" a new creature."

Pauline Christology is Independent of an

not in any



PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY 219
particular derivable from the teaching of Jesus. We have, in fact, no right to interpret Pauline expressions on the presupposition of a background for which there is evidence
only in documents of later date. And if the independence of Paulinism is visible to men who have accepted as genuine
the bulk of the Epistles, how much more decidedly can it be affirmed when the Pauline documents have been separated from the catholicizing and other dogmatic discourses into which they have been inserted, or which have been inserted into them ! The writer of the Gnostic Epistles knows absolutely nothing concerning the life-story of a human Jesus, nor can the communities for which he wrote have
known anything, if Bousset and Reitzenstein are right
and surely they are —in saying that Paulinism was a growth, not a system fashioned within the mind of a single man. And the growth must have continued over a considerable period of time. We have traced it from the Wisdom of
Solomon through the Odes to the Pauline Epistles, developing gradually under the influence of contemporary thought; but of any influence due to the teaching of Jesus there is
I not the faintest trace. " The conception of Jesus as Lord of
the community," wrote Bousset,1 " was not the work of the Apostle, but the fundamental conviction of the Christian community." That is to say, Jesus for the Pauline com
munities was " the Lord " just as Adonis or Osiris was
" the Lord " for the communities which worshipped them. The title was used absolutely by religious communities only of beings considered to be divine. Jesus, in fact, was the cult-hero of the Pauline communities ; cult-god would not be an inappropriate term, for, although Paul could not
apply the term " god " to Jesus, yet, as Bousset observes, the general belief of the communities would easily transcend the distinction and, as the example of Clement of Alexandria and other Hellenistic Christian writers shows, it would ere long consciously speak of the great mystery of the godhead of Christ. For in cult and ritual it had already unconsciously
done so. But if Jesus had been for certain communities
" the Lord," whether as god or as Son of God, before Paul
1 Kyr. Chr., p. 107.



220 PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY
and how long before who shall say ?—the period of " deifi
cation " assumed by theologians is so much reduced as to render the supposed fact even less credible than it was already. Bousset does not clearly distinguish between the Pauline and other Christian communities, and it is possible that Paul introduced the name Jesus into certain com munities which had previously worshipped a nameless Christ ; but the name must have been a divine one before it could be so applied.
In the fact that Bousset has seen and honestly and courageously uttered so much of the truth as he has done we may perceive the first gleam of the dawn of a more scientific treatment of the early history of Christian dogma. Theo logical criticism cannot be permanently satisfied to rest at the standpoint to which he has brought it. He sums up his
conclusions as follows :
The picture which Paul actually draws of the Lord Jesus
is not taken from the earthly career of Jesus of Nazareth.
The Jesus whom Paul knows is the pre-existent supernal
Christ, who was rich and became poor for our sake, who
was in the form of God and took the form of a servant. It
is into this personification of Jesus that are fitted all the
characteristics which Paul here and there brings into pro
minence : his humility, his obedience, his love, his truthful
ness, his faithfulness even unto the death on the cross. The
subject of all these predicates is not the " historical " Jesus.
For an outline of a personal portrait of Jesus, strictly speak
ing even for a foundation for it, especially as regards his
piety and his faith in God, Paul in the proclamation of his
Gospel has no more place at all. He preaches, not the faith
of Jesus, but faith in Jesus. How will anyone any longer
talk of a personal portrait of Jesus by Paul in our sense of
the term ? 1
8. Priority of the Odes of Solomon
There is no descent of Jesus into Hell in the Pauline doctrine. The supposition that it formed part of the doctrine of the Odist is, as was pointed out previously, probably due
to a misunderstanding of his imagery. A comparison of Paulinism with the doctrine of the Odes should have made
1 Kyr. Chr., p. 144.



PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY 221
it clear that the latter is the more primitive. In the former we find new elements which were absorbed from contem
porary religious ideas. It is easier to explain Paulinism as a development out of the doctrine of the Odes than the converse. Further evidence which seems by itself to be
conclusive can be given. In the Odes the Most High is very rarely named God. The writer follows the usage of the
Psalms in employing the term " the Lord." And this term, which in the Epistles appears as a designation of Christ, is in the Odes hardly ever so used. The Pauline writer has become familiar with Greek religious terminology, and is much less dependent upon the Old Testament. The appli
cation of the title " the Lord " to Jesus in the Pauline communities proves that he had become to all intents and
purposes their " cult-god." In the community O " the
Christ " still retained its Jewish meaning of " the anointed."
It had not yet become a proper name ; and the " anointing " was as figurative as the anointing of Adam with oil from the
tree of life probably was in the Clementine Recognitions. In the Epistles Christ in conjunction with Jesus has become a proper name. The time interval between the dates of composition of the Odes and the Epistles respectively must in fact have been considerable. The former stand closer to the Wisdom of Solomon than they do to the latter. The
designation of God as " the Most High " both in the Wisdom books and in the Odes is by itself an indication of this.
9. The Character of the Fourth Gospel
The Fourth Gospel, like the Pauline Epistles, has been Catholicized. We find in it, though less varied, similar opposition of doctrine. The basis of the Gospel is a Gnostic document in which extensive interpolated passages are recognizable, the purpose of some, but not all, being to neutralize the primitive Gnosticism. Schmiedel has seen the
inconsistency and is puzzled by it. " We would much like
to know," he says, " whether this mingling is due entirely to
a want of clearness or whether it admits of a more satis
factory explanation." It does. Schmiedel's conjectural



222 PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY
solution is that the writer was in process of passing from
Gnosticism to the teaching of the Church —the same old assumption by which critics have attempted to explain the heterogeneity of the Pauline doctrine. The explanation is as impossible in this case as in the other. What we find is not a partially Catholicized Gnosticism, but sometimes the full expression of a Gnostic idea closely followed by Catholic doctrine enforced with an emphasis which proves that it was introduced to counteract the foregoing Gnosticism. The original writer was so thoroughly a Gnostic as to declare
that the god of the Jews was evil and not the Father of Jesus.1 Schmiedel states the case fairly accurately when he
says that " the Gnostic ideas appear, in the main, sporadically, and are withdrawn or made harmless by other utterances." 2
It is not a fact that the writer wavers between two opinions ; he expresses his own opinions clearly and strongly. The supposition that after doing so he would immediately withdraw them or make them harmless by other utterances
is quite unjustifiable and most improbable ; but it is exactly what a Catholicizing editor might be expected to do. As a Gnostic the writer was a thoroughgoing symbolist.3
It is not surprising that a critic of Schmiedel's intelligence has realized this fact, but his bias as a Christian theologian has prevented him from applying his knowledge consistently. One example of the writer's symbolism is the living water which Jesus says he would have given to the Samaritan
woman. We know what this water was. We have read of it in the Odes of Solomon. And just as this water of life was
spiritual drink so also the bread of God from heaven (vi, 33)
is spiritual food. But we learn from verse 35 that Jesus himself, the spiritual Christ therefore, is this bread of life, which consequently cannot be literally eaten. We have learnt already that in the Gnostic Christian Eucharist the bread was not the body of Jesus, but was a symbol of the
1 Jn. viii, 19, 38, 44. The correct translation of verse 44 is " Ye
are from the father of the devil "— i.e., Demiurgus.
2 The Johannine Writings, p. 165.
5 Several leading critics including Loisy, Kreyenbtihl, and Dr.
E. A. Abbott have recognized the symbolic character of the Fourth Gospel.



PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY 223
union of the members one with another, and of their spiritual
union with the Christ. It was impossible for a Gnostic to imagine that he was eating the flesh of Jesus in his sacrament. And, since for the writer of the Fourth Gospel Jesus was the Logos, for him also the thought that he could partake of his flesh and blood must have been not only meaningless but even repugnant.1 There is evidence of this in the Gospel
itself. The Feeding of the Five Thousand (vi, 5-14), as Schmiedel perceived, is intended to represent the sacred meal, which, however, is not the Catholic Sacrament. That is made clear in the closely following verses in which Jesus with direct reference to the Feeding tells the people that he
is the bread of life which came down from Heaven —spiritual food, namely. Further evidence that John did not hold the Catholic view of the Sacrament is found in his account of the
Last Supper, where he refrains —we must suppose, inten
tionally refrains —from making Jesus give his disciples the bread and wine naming them his flesh and blood.
Several eminent critics —e.g., Wellhausen and Loisy have recognized the fact that the Fourth Gospel is composite.
Like the Gospel of Mark, it had a history. Schwarz 2 noted
three stages in the formation of the book : a fundamental
document which he describes as " a sort of dramatic poem of great originality," and two subsequent editions, the purpose of the second being to make the Gospel more acceptable to the Church. Consequently the primitive work was in ferably current in some Gnostic community before there is
any known reference to it. Loisy 3 has observed that :
At bottom the primary document, the liberties which an
editor has taken in the face of the synoptic tradition, and
even that very tradition itself, prove that, if Jesus occupied
a definite place in the history of mankind, Jesus Christ was
first and foremost a theologic and liturgic theme, an object
of religious worship, under an extremely fluid historical appearance.
1 Cp. vi, 63 : " It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth
nothing." That is a Gnostic opinion against which Tertullian
protests.

224 PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY
The Gnostic Christ was altogether a theologic theme. In the Odea of Solomon the Christ is personified ; in the Fourth
Gospel, as the narrative form required, he is individualized ; but he is not the Jesus of the Synoptics. No criterion but a subjective one can be applied for the purpose of deciding
which of the two figures, if either, is the historical Jesus. Theologians cannot extract even from the Synoptics a Jesus-figure upon which they are all agreed.1 Bousset agrees with Loisy in the opinion that the intention of John 2 was not to supplement but to correct the Synoptics. We might even say that his Gospel is a protest against their
presentation of the Christ —not, however, on the ground of historical truth, but of what he conceived to be religious
truth. It is no accident that his Jesus is not a promulgator
of ethical doctrine —which was not a function of the Logos and that he works comparatively few miracles. The Gnostic composer of the Fourth Gospel was consciously not writing the biography of a man. His purpose was to illustrate allegorically the power of the Word ; and the few miracles he records, which, doubtless intentionally, he terms
" signs " [ ? symbols], are symbolic representations of the
progress of the Christian religion and of the spiritual life which flowed forth from the community inspired by the
Word. It is the great merit of Schmiedel to have seen this, even though he has not fully realized the significance of it.
" The wine," he says, " into which Jesus changed the water
at Cana, is, of course, the new, glowing, and inspiring religion which Jesus puts in the place of a weak Judaism." s
But it was no historical Jesus who did this ; it was the spiritual doctrine of the incarnate Word, whose development we have traced from the Wisdom of Solomon.*- The Evangelists
1 Schweitzer's judgment on the search for the features of the
historical Jesus is expressed in the words : " There is nothing more
negative than the result of the critical study of the life of Jesus."
And Dr. Burkitt's comment upon Weinel's assertion that " we
know him very well," is " What a claim ! "
* I use the name John to designate the Gnostic writer of the
Fourth Gospel.
* No place named Cana is mentioned in any document except the
Fourth Gospel. The name may have been suggested by the Greek
word henna (new things).

PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY 225
ascribe to Jesus their own contradictory opinions. The Epistles record no abrogation of the Law by the man
Jesus ; the writers say : " Christ is the end of the Law "a very different thing. We may be sure, too, that the writer of the Fourth Gospel meant something important by
connecting this " sign " with a marriage. The " marriage " may have signified union between the Judaic and Hellenistic Christian Churches.
The Christ of Matthew is a Jew, but the Christ of John is as devoid of nationality as the Word of the Odes of Solomon.
When addressing the Jews he is pointedly made to say
" your law." 10. The Johannine Logos
It is evident from the Prologue to the Gospel that the Johannine Jesus is the pre-existent Logos, and we must infer that the absence of a birth-story is intentional. The
Logos of John cannot have been " born." The Prologue, part of which is included in chap, iii, appears to be older than
the Gospel itself. In its original state it contained no refer
ence to John the Baptist.1 There are several passages in the Gospel which reproduce the doctrine of the Odes of Solomon.
It cannot with certainty be inferred that the Odes were known to the Evangelist, because the doctrine must have been that of some very early Gnostic Christian communities, but the striking resemblances in the Prologue to some passages in the Odes rather point to knowledge of them on
the part of the writer of it. For convenience of comparison
I place corresponding passages in parallel columns.

The Johannine Word is precisely the Word of the Odes ; a spiritual being capable of becoming immanent in men. And in those in whom the Word abides the Father also abides.1

drew attention to resemblances between the phraseology of the
Prologue and Proverbs iii and viii which seem to show that the
writer of the Prologue knew that the Word was derived from Wisdom.

PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY 227y
It will be seen that with both writers the " abiding " is conceived in a very real way as the dwelling of the Spirit of the Lord in the soul of the believer. Though this was also the doctrine of Paul it is evident that the affinity between
John and the Odist is closer than that between Paul and the Odist. Paulinism was affected more by external influences. Johannine Christianity exhibits on the whole the earlier form and must have had its roots deep down in the first century.1 But, whatever the differences, the core of the
doctrine —viz., that the assurance of salvation comes from
union with the Christ — is common to all three ; and so is the denial of a bodily resurrection. The apocalyptic doctrine of a final judgment by the Son of Man has been imposed upon the Fourth Gospel ; but the Gnostic writer expressly
repudiated it (iii, 17-19), particularly in the words : " He that believeth is not judged; he that believeth not hath
been judged already " ; because the pneumatic man is immortal; and the carnal man must perish once and for ever. Union with the spiritual Christ is symbolized in the
eating of the Bread of Life. " The Feeding of the Five
Thousand," wrote Schmiedel, " is a spiritual enjoyment of the person of Jesus." 2 While commending Schmiedel's insight one must take exception to his use of the word
" person " in relation to a Sacrament which symbolically expresses a spiritual fact. Although John for the purpose of his narrative has to represent Jesus as a person he cannot
have so regarded him ; for he makes him say : "I and the
Father are one." Otherwise stated, the Johannine Christ is the Word of the Odes of Solomon inseparable from the
Father.3 The quoted speech is not a mere metaphor, for
elsewhere (xiv, 10) Jesus says : " The Father abiding in me
1 B. Bultmann wrote in 1925 : " We cannot overlook the possi
bility that the Johannine Christianity represents a type more ancient
than the synoptic."
s The Joh. Writ., p. 97.
* The Greek of Jn. i, 1, expresses a relationship between God and
the Logos which cannot be expressed in English without circum
locution. The meaning is that the Logos is in some sense God with
out being actually God himself. The conception of the Odes,
according to which the Word is a spiritual extension of the divine
essence, quite meets the case. God and the Word form an indivisible
unity, without identity.



228 PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY
doeth his works ... I am in the Father and the Father in
me." The Logos of John is, in fact, like the Logos of the
Odes —God in relation to man. Being " in the Father " in the present tense implies simultaneous existence in Heaven and upon the earth, a condition which was possible for the
spiritual Logos of John. We may compare Seneca's
simile :
As the rays of the sun indeed fall upon the earth, but are
only at home in the place from whence they came, so is it
with the great and holy Spirit, which is sent down hither
in order that we may have closer acquaintance with God.
He has dealings with us, but clings to the source from which he sprang.
So we see that the thought which is the main theme of the Odes of Solomon and was transmitted to John was known
also to Seneca. We should not, for the sake of a materializing theory, deny to a Christian writer the possibility of rising in
thought to the spiritual altitude of a Pagan. In iii, 13, Jesus
says of himself : " No man hath ascended into Heaven but he that descended out of Heaven, the Son of Man who is in Heaven." The last four words are omitted in many MSS., presumably by Catholicizing editors. Schmiedel observes :
" They very appropriately reflect John's idea about Jesus, and were therefore certainly written by him." 1 Schmiedel infers from the affinity between the ideas of John and Philo that the former must have been acquainted with the writings of the latter. Now Philo frequently writes of the Logos in
terms which imply personality ; and yet it is certain that he did not regard the Logos as literally a person, any more than
the writer of Proverbs, who said that Wisdom had " built her house," believed that Wisdom was a person. Modern critics do not make allowance for the difference between the mentality of religious thinkers of the first century and their
own. It is quite possible for John to have written his Gospel without any belief that Jesus was a person who had actually
1 Work cited, p. 153. But in spite of Schmiedel's opinion it is some
what doubtful whether passages in which the term " Son of Man "
appears belong to the oldest stratum of the Gospel. The Son of
Man in this verse, however, is more like the Naassene than the
apocalyptic Son of Man.



PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY 229
lived in Palestine. True, we read
(i,
14) that " the Word
became flesh "
;
but
is
it
likely that those words were really written by John
?
Schmiedel, who does not doubt this, nevertheless sees that,
if
genuine, they cannot be literally meant. He interprets them to mean that the Logos clothed himself with flesh.1 As we have already seen, there
is
a sense in which that could be said by a Gnostic. But,
if
the interpretation
is
in any sense correct, the visible flesh of Jesus was a mere envelope and no part of the spiritual Christ, hence there could have been no religious significance in the eating of it. According to John the Logos came down from Heaven as spirit and reascended as spirit; and that was a Gnostic heresy. Ignatius wrote
:
" For
I
know that after the Resurrection he was in the flesh, and
I
believe he
is
so now."
2
In the Ignatian doctrine Jesus was " spiritually
united " with the Father
;
but all the Catholic writers
affirmed that the Ascension was " in the flesh." The Catholic leaders must have understood the character of the Johannine Christology very well, and they would never have granted canonicity to its unadulterated Gnosticism.3 Realizing this, we can understand the vigour with which an editor has stated the Catholic view of the Sacrament (vi, 52-56)
immediately following the spiritual doctrine of the Bread of Life. The very emphasis with which the statement
is
made betrays the motive of it. There are passages in the Gospel which look like Docetism, but they should perhaps be understood as indications of the symbolic character of the writer's Jesus. For example, in viii, 59, Jesus in the Temple
is
surrounded by Jews who take
up stones to cast at him, but " he hid himself and went out of the Temple." Which
is
as much as to say that he made
himself invisible. In the circumstances
it
would have been a physical impossibility for Jesus to hide himself and go out

of the Temple. In x, 39, again, the Jews who were " round
about him " " sought again to take him and he went forth out of their hand." There is no reason to suppose that the writer in making such statements believed that he was recording facts. He was writing an allegory; and by the intangibility of Jesus he indicates that his Logos is no more
a " person " than the Word of the Odes of Solomon. If he
had been intending to relate facts he would have had some
regard to what theologians call " the tradition," assuming of course that he believed there were any known facts, which, in view of the character of his Gospel, one may take leave to doubt.1
In the Odes of Solomon the Word, being a metaphysical
abstraction conceived as a spiritual emanation, is able, not withstanding the personification, to have his dwelhng-place
in man. It was impossible for John to predicate this un
ambiguously with respect to his individualized Christ. In
certain passages the immanence of the Christ is asserted
for example, in xvii, 21, where it is written : " That they may
all be one ; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee,
that they may be in us " ; and again in verse 23 : " I in them, and thou in me." The chapter from which these
verses are quoted is Johannine and no doubt very early ; it may have formed part of a liturgy ; but it was not a con
stituent part of the primary Gospel. In the Gospel itself the
difficulty is got over by substituting the spoken word of
Jesus for the divine Word —e.g., in v, 24 : " He that heareth
my word . . . hath eternal life." To imagine that " word " in this verse means instruction or the injunctions of morality would be to ignore the whole character of the Johannine Christology. Evidently it is conceived as something which
has in itself, not merely through what it imparts, a lifegiving power. Further than that, as in the Odes, he who has
received " my word " has risen from the dead ; for the verse
continues, " hath passed out of death into life." In viii, 28, again, we have an indication that the word spoken by Jesus
is synonymous with the divine Word —that is to say, him
1 In the process of Catholicization a small amount of synoptic
material was introduced into this Gospel, as Loisy and Wellhausen
have shown.



PAULINE AND JOHANNLNE CHRISTIANITY 231
self : " I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me
I speak these things." Jesus, as the Word, is the medium of
communication between God and men. And in verse 31 he
says : " If ye abide in my word, then are ye truly my
disciples, and the truth shall make you free." The " truth "
is Gnosis, and the " freedom " is liberation from the bondage of heimarmene. He who believes that the Christ is the Son of God and that he was sent by God has received not only
" my word " but also " the Word." Wellhausen, in spite of his insight into the character of the Fourth Gospel, seems to have gone rather perversely astray
when he wrote :
By union with Christ is meant not a mystical union with
the person of Jesus, but a rational one with the truth he
announces. There is, moreover, no question of the historical
Jesus ((caret vapKa) and of familiar acquaintance with him,
but, exactly as with Paul, solely with the heavenly.1
Wellhausen sees that what is signified is " immanence," but he thinks the immanence is not in the individual but in the Church. Surely it must have been in the former before it could be in the latter. No doubt he is right so far ihat the
" works " of Jesus are the works of the Christian community in which the Father operates through the immanent Logos.
But if by " rational " Wellhausen intends to imply an intellectual process, his own rationality has misled him. The
union conceived was " mystical " ; certainly not indeed with
the " historical " Jesus, but with the heavenly Christ. How
could such a union be other than mystical ? The " truth " proclaimed by Jesus is not logically demonstrable truth ;
it is theosophical truth, Gnosis really, even though the writer did not employ that term. The word has the same
meaning in this Gospel as it has in the Odes of Solomon.
Seeing that Wellhausen understood union with Christ to
mean union with the truth —i.e., with his word —he should have realized that union with the Christ and abiding in his word were intended to signify one and the same thing. By
his use of the term " acquaintance," Wellhausen has obscured
1 Das Evangelium Johannis, p. 118.



232 PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY
the issue. One can have familiar acquaintance with a material
person, but not, in the usual sense of the words, with a
divine being. Paul had no thought of " acquaintance " in that sense. Wellhausen is, of course, quite right in saying that in this Gospel there is no question of familiar ac quaintance with the historical Jesus. The essential identity, in a mystical sense, of the Johannine Christ with the word spoken by him was seen by
Bousset,1 who, quoting Jn. xv, 7— " If ye abide in me, and
my words abide in you "—and xv, 3—" Ye are clean
because of the word which I have spoken to you "—observes
that community with Christ corresponds exactly to com
munity with the Word, and that the word spoken by Jesus has the redemptive power of the Logos himself.2
11. Resubbection
The interpolated section, vi, 52-56, contradicts another
opinion of the Gnostic writer with the words : " I will raise him up at the last day." Notwithstanding the important
differences between the doctrines of Paul and John, as regards the Gnostic fundamentals they are in agreement, and there is no future resurrection in either of them. The spirit is immortal and its life is continuous. The spirit is
the man, " The flesh profiteth nothing." When Martha says she knows that her brother will rise again in the resurrection
at the last day, Jesus corrects her with the words :
I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth on
me, though he die, yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth
and believeth on me shall never die.
For John, as for Paul, death of the body is not death in
the Gnostic sense of the word " death " ; and the believer has already risen from the dead. Expression is given to this
view also in vi, 51 : "I am the living bread ... if any man
eat of this bread he shall live for ever." The bread from
Heaven is spiritual bread and must be spiritually " eaten."

of Jesus stands for Jesus himself. Poim., p. 5.



PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY 233
The bread of the Gnostic Eucharist was, of course, not itself the living bread; it was only a symbol of it. But the Catholic editor has tacked on to the verse his materialistic
dogma that " the bread which I shall give him is my flesh."
It is strange that Schmiedel, with all his insight, should have perversely tried to explain the miracle of the Raising of Lazarus from the supposed misunderstanding of a symbolic
expression in a discourse—not a discourse of Jesus. The
explanation savours of the demoded Rationalism of H. E. G. Paulus.1 How can Schmiedel have failed to see that in his
anxiety to exonerate John from " any idea of deception or
forgery " or from " censurable indulgence in phantasies " he was depreciating him, substituting dependence upon a
false rumour for spirituality and imagination ? It would be doing no service to the reputation of Spenser to rationalize the fine allegories of the Faerie Queene in so paltry a manner.
This kind of criticism would have to blame Bunyan for
" censurable indulgence in phantasies." The story has been explained as a pendant to that of Dives and Lazarus in Luke. The allegory in Luke concludes with the words of
Abraham to Dives : "If they hear not Moses and the
prophets neither will they be persuaded though one should rise from the dead." Dives and his brethren typify the Jews.
In the Fourth Gospel Lazarus does rise from the dead and yet the Jews are not persuaded. The explanation may be
correct so far as it goes, but it is certain that the story in John has deeper significance than that.2 The writer, in fact, prepares his readers for the understanding of it in the
declaration of Jesus to Martha : " I am the resurrection
and the life." It is a verbal picture illustrating that passage in the Odes of Solomon in which the dead in Sheol are brought
to life by the power of the Word. The death is spiritual death. Lazarus is a type of the Pagan world, not only dead

has no connection with the Rationalism of the Rationalist Press
Association.

me, that the date of the story in Luke is later than that of the

but corrupt, yet still capable of receiving life from the source
of life, the Christ-Logos, speaking through the congregation
of the saints, the corporate Word. Martha, it is evident, typifies the Judaic Christian who believed in a resurrection of the body and a day of judgment and was still cumbered with Judaic observances. Mary then of course typifies the Hellenistic Christian. Martha goes to meet Jesus because the first Christians were Jews ; Mary, as the Gentile Chris
tian, is " called " (verse 28).
12. God -Vision
Bousset draws attention to an important aspect of the Johannine Christ-mysticism, which, he says, tends to pass
over into God-mysticism —viz., the Gnostic conception of
the " vision of God " attainable through Gnosis. In this
Gospel it is obtained by those who have seen the Christ.
" He that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me." The writer of these words cannot have meant that every one who had seen Jesus had seen God. He was not thinking of physical vision and most decidedly not of an intellectual process by which one could infer the goodness of God from the admirable qualities of some man. And
where, in the Prologue, it is said that " the Word dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory as of the only begotten
from the Father " the writer is speaking for himself and his fellow-believers who had never actually seen the Word. He is exactly duplicating the thought of the Odist, who wrote
that God had " given himself to be seen," and that the
Word " appeared in the perfection of his Father." We find this conception of god-vision in contemporary Mystery
religions. In certain of the Mysteries the vision was realized through the brilliant illumination of a picture or image of the god in a chamber otherwise dark. But, as Bousset observes, later tliis crude procedure was usually refined
away. It is known, however, that something of the kind was practised at the Sacrament of certain Christian Gnostics. The officiating priest in the Pagan Mysteries by suitable means induced in the worshippers an ecstatic condition in which they imagined that the god had appeared to them.



PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY 235
A common procedure seems to have been for the worshipper to gaze at a bright light and utter a prayer in which the
words " come, appear to me " were frequently repeated.
A typical prayer to Horus is quoted by Reitzenstein. After the invocation the god is supposed to appear and the
worshipper cries " Hftil, lord, god of gods, benefactor." ". The meaning attached by the writer of the Fourth Gospel to the God-vision can be better understood from Philo, who
wrote of " men capable of vision," whom he terms therapeutic
(worshipful) men, and says that " they should be encouraged to look continually upon that which they have learnt of the divine essence, until they see what they long for." Philo certainly was not thinking of physical vision; he was reproducing in purified form a prevalent idea; and so no
doubt was John.2 In the Mysteries the god-vision was
supposed to operate as " deification " and to ensure im
mortality. In a papyrus prayer we read : " For thou art
I and I am thou." There is not much difference between
this and the Johannine formula : " I in them and thou in me." The Christian writer could not precisely identify himself with God, but he could believe that God was abiding in him through the indwelling Word. And, equally with the Pagan, he believed that the God-vision was the guarantee of
immortality. " This is life eternal, that they should know thee, the only true God." As in the Odes of Solomon, mystical
" seeing " is mystical " knowing."
The " knowledge " of the Johannine writings is altogether
mystical knowledge which resides in, and is bound up
with, the God-vision. " To see " and " to know " are used
almost synonymously and are interchangeable with one
another. Believers " know " because God and Jesus have
1 Poim., pp. 27 f . In these prayers, as in the Christian documents,
we find very great importance attached to " the name " of the god.
Horus had several names, of which one was Jaoai.
* Egyptian Gnostics had risen to this point. In the Corpus
Hermeticum, Tat, the disciple of Hermes, says : "I see the greatness
with its visible* form." Hermes tells him that this is not yet god
vision, since " the true " is bodiless. The Logos of the Odes and
of John is also " the true," and is also bodiless. Or again are we to
say that a Christian writer was incapable of the lofty thought of a
Pagan?



236 PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY
known them. Hence the " truth " which behevers receive
from the " fulness " of the Logos appears as correlative with
" grace." And this " truth " is a divine, living power.1
Just like the Truth and Grace of the Odes where " Truth "
and " Grace " are titles of the Word. It is impossible not to recognize community of ideas between the Johannine and the Egyptian theosophy. And these ideas were already
in existence before the Christian era. In the Egyptian theosophy the Logos, who was assimilated to Hermes while Hermes again was assimilated to the god Thot, was viewed not only as the agent of the creation, but also as the bringer of divine revelation and the means of regeneration, securing
immortality. A statement in the Hermetic Genikoi Logoi
" no one can be saved before being born again " —corresponds
closely with the saying of Jesus in John : " Except a man
be born anew he cannot see the Kingdom of God " (iii, 3).
There is also a close resemblance between the question of
Nicodemus in the next verse of the Gospel and the reply of
Tat to his teacher in the Corp. Herm. : " I know not, O Trismegistos, from what kind of womb thou wast reborn
and from what kind of seed." " The antiquity of the
Genikoi Logoi," says Reitzenstein, " must guarantee it against any suspicion of Christian influence." The Greek word pleroma (fulness), which occurs in the Prologue to the Fourth Gospel and also in Colos. i, 19, was much used by Gnostics. The early vogue of the term appears
from its use by Philo in a sense similar to that in which it
was used in the Pagan theosophy. In Corp. Herm., XII, 15,
it is written : " This whole cosmos, the great god and image
of the greater ... is the fulness of life." And in VI, 4, " For
the cosmos is the fulness of evil, but God of good—or the
good of God." An opinion which is deprecated in IX, 4, in
the words : " For we say that evil must reside in its own place. For its. place is the earth, not the cosmos, as some say,
blaspheming." Reitzenstein observes :
I readily confess that I can as little separate the sentence
" God is the fulness of good " from the Gospel passage " Of
1 Bousset, Kyr. Chr., p. 207.



PAULINE AND JOHANNINE CHRISTIANITY 237
his fulness we all received and grace for grace," as I can the
sentence " the God is the fulness of life " from that other
one, " In him was life and the life was the light of men." 1
There are also resemblances between the Shepherd of
Hermas and Poimandres which cannot be accidental. In particular it is demonstrable that the Shepherd himself was
copied from the divine Poimandres (shepherd of men) who is
also Hermes and Nous. It is probable that the writer of the Odes of Solomon was familiar, not with Poimandres itself, but
with literature of a similar character. Reitzenstein has given reasons for thinking that the sources of the Hermetic literature are pre-Christian and that Poimandres in its most ancient form must be dated earlier than the beginning of the second Christian century.2
1 Poim., p. 26 n.
2 Some of the expressions used by ancient Christian writers have
gradually been invested in modern thought with a different signifi
cation corresponding with a change in the religious outlook. This
observation applies particularly to several of the quotations made
in the foregoing chapter. Readers should be on their guard against
reading into such expressions modern ideas which were certainly
not in the mind of the writer.



CHAPTER VIII
THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL
1. Its General Character
Until we come to a Gospel —that is to say, at earliest until
the close of the first century —we find in the Christian documents no apparent knowledge of the doings or sayings of
the man Jesus, but very much concerning the death and resurrection of a divine Christ. And there is nothing to
indicate that this death had any connection with an historic event. The Resurrection, moreover, is of greater importance than the death. There is no justification for the opinion that belief in the resurrection of Jesus was the cause of the belief in his divinity. The Resurrection could not have had the dogmatic value which is attached to it in this early literature unless the Christ who rose had already been regarded as a divine being. No evidence of the actuality of the Resurrec
tion is forthcoming — 1 Cor. xv, 1-8, being later than a
Gospel —it is an article of religious belief ; Christ must have
risen, for, if not, there is no possibility of a resurrection for anybody. That is the only reason for believing in it which
the writer of 1 Cor. xv, 12 ff., can give.1 The writers of
the earliest Pauline Epistles " preach Christ crucified "obviously a dogma ; such an expression would not be used of
a known historic event. The dogma is a " stumbling-block " to Jews, but in one passage only is it even implied that the Jews were responsible for the Crucifixion, and Pilate is not
mentioned at all. In 1 Thess.
ii,
15,
it
is
said that the Jews
" killed the Lord Jesus "
;
but since in the following verse the reader
is
reminded that " the wrath
is
come upon them to
the uttermost " the passage must have been written later than the year 70.

THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL 239
In the foregoing pages abundant evidence of the Gnostic fondness for allegory has been given. The Gnostic Justin set forth his theosophical opinions in an allegory which revolves about a shepherd Jesus. The number of super natural beings introduced into this work prevent its being mistaken for a record of real events ; but a gifted Gnostic whose imagination was more restrained could, in spite of the supernatural character of his narrative, have produced the impression that his book had some foundation in fact. The
Fourth Gospel, which cannot be true if the Synoptics are true,
may be given as an example. And if we have to decide whether this Gospel is fiction pure and simple or allegory there is no reason to hesitate. Examples of John's allegorical
method have been given. But if Justin's story of Jesus and John's story of Jesus are allegories why should not the Gospel of Mark be an allegory ? To illustrate his conception of the Christ in that way is just what a Gnostic who had the requisite literary ability would be likely to do. The supposi tion that that is what happened is entirely consistent with the fact that before the appearance of a Gospel there is no evidence that anything whatever concerning the life-story of Jesus was known. The symbolic character of Mark's Gospel has been demonstrated by W. B. Smith.1 The book itself does not claim to be the story of a man. The subject of it is
announced as " The good tidings of Jesus Christ, the Son of
God " ; and the Jesus Christ of this Gospel is not " Son of
God " as a holy man might be termed a son of God ; he is Son of God in some- fashion which is very real and unique. Did the original writer believe that any mortal had ever been, or could ever have been, Son of God in that sense, or was his Jesus Christ not rather an individualization of some such]
metaphysical being as the Son of God of the Odes of Solomon,
just as the Jesus Christ of John is the individualized Word ? The whole character of the Gospel goes to show that the latter supposition is the true one. The writer, in spite of some uncouthness in his diction, was a great literary artist, and by graphical touches he has produced an appearance of actuality
which has deceived many generations of readers ; but a cool,
1 Ecce Deus, pp. 110 fi.



240 THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL
critical judgment must pronounce with Wellhausen that
" one never gets the impression that an attempt had been made by those who had eaten and drunk with Jesus to give
others a notion of his personality " ; and with Dr. W. B.
Bacon that " in spite of a graphic style and an interest in externals much more apparent than in Matthew or Luke, our Evangelist is conspicuously lacking in a really historical conception of Jesus's career." Anybody who can without
prepossession compare this Gospel with any biographical
sketch must realize that we have in it literature of an entirely
different order, and that too not merely by reason of its
supernatural character. If there had ever stood behind the Gospel a known person, some of those intimate recollections derived from private intercourse which are found in all bio graphies must have made their appearance. The graphic
touches are of the superficial and artificial character which a
skilful writer of fiction knows how to supply. " The scanti
ness of the tradition," wrote Wellhausen in another place,
" is remarkable." And this scanty remnant is not really
known to be " tradition " ; it is the irreducible residue which up to the present has resisted the acid of modern criticism, and there are critics who accept even less than Wellhausen
does. Prof. R. Bultmann, in a monograph upon Jesus
written in 1926, said that in his opinion practically nothing
more can be learnt of the life and personality of Jesus, because the Christian sources have not concerned themselves
therewith. " What has been written," he continues,
" during a hundred and fifty years on the life of Jesus, his
personality, his inner development, and so forth, is—in so far
as it is not critical investigation —fantastic and romancist."; And the net result of the critical investigation is a pro gressive destruction of the record. But the Gospel, like that
of John, is not fiction, it is allegory.1
It might be argued that since the writer was intending to
recount the acts of the Son of God he would deliberately omit any details which indicated the mere humanity of his
1 We may infer from the Christian humanization of the Logos
Simon that there was a Simonian allegory of which he was the
subject.



THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL 241
Jesus. The objection involves the unlikely assumption of the writer's belief that a known man had been the unique
Son of God. And, if the writer's intention was to depict the Son of God, of what value is his Gospel as evidence of the real existence of a man ? The assumption that he deliberately rejected known facts which would have been inconsistent with his presentation of the Christ also involves the con clusion that he was completely divorced from tradition ; and upon the rock of that conclusion Schmiedel's thesis of the Nine Pillars is hopelessly wrecked.1 Those who attach weight to Schmiedel's argument are thus faced with this
dilemma. If Mark was cognizant of intimate details which
he refused to record he was not tied to a tradition ; if he had no knowledge of any such details the existence of any tradi tion may reasonably be questioned.2 Papias states that whenever he met anyone who had seen an apostle, he made a point of inquiring what the apostle had said. Let anyone think what a wealth of personal recollec tions in the case of any noteworthy historical character would thus have been transmitted. And yet we may confidently infer from the silence of early writers who were acquainted with the works of Papias that he had learnt in this manner absolutely no biographical details at all. Papias mentions
" apostles," but there is no reason to believe that ary of these apostles had been personally acquainted with Jesus. Irenaeus, when a young man, had conversed with Polycarp, who had known the apostles and had learnt what he could from them. Was Irenaeus as incurious concerning details of
the life of Jesus as Paul was ? That is difficult to believe, if
the real existence of Jesus meant to him what it means to
modern theologians. In any case the absolute non-existence
1 For a detailed refutation of Schmiedel's thesis, see Ecee Dens,
pp. 177-207.
1 Some apologists—e.g., A. Richardson, work cited, pp. 45 ff.
who are quite alive to the unbiographical character of Mark's Gospel,
explain it by saying that the first Christians were uninterested in the
details of the life of Jesus ! and that " the Resurrection claim was
the whole content of the earliest preaching." In other words, the
foundation of Christianity is not the life-work of a remarkable man,
but a dogma. The explanation given implies that from the very first
.Christians had no interest in Jesus as a man. What then becomes of
the argument from " personality " ?



242 THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL
of any anecdote or personal reminiscence is in the cir cumstances most significant. The critical conclusion which would be drawn by a secular historian from such a state
of the case is that there was no tradition relative to an
" historical " Jesus. When no water issues from the open
lower end of a pipe connected with a cistern we infer that the
cistern is empty. Irenaeus does, it is true, record one " tradi
tion," and we may be quite sure he would have recorded
others if he could. But the tradition which he records is that
Jesus Uved to be rather an old man ! l The destructive analysis of modern criticism has left to the Gospels an
extremely small residue of " tradition." Outside the Gospels, even in a number of places where we might reasonably expect to find some, we are met by a perfect
blank. It would be absurd to argue that the Evangelists had so completely reaped the field of tradition that nothing was left for anyone else to report. The affinity between the concluding section of Mark [xvi,
1-8] and the corresponding section of the Gospel of Peter is so
close that either one of them is dependent upon the other or
both are dependent upon a common original. And it is
shown elsewhere in this book that in this portion of the narrative the Gospel of Peter has preserved on the whole the
earlier form. A very early edition of the Gospel upon which the Synoptics are based seems to have concluded with the
words, " Then the women fled affrighted," so that it con tained no appearance of Jesus after the Resurrection. The section which follows in the Gospel of Peter looks like a
subsequent addition, as Mk. xvi, 9-20, is known to be. Now, in the apocryphal Gospel the angel says to the women
concerning Jesus : " He is risen and gone thither from
whence he was sent "—implying that at first the Resurrec tion and Ascension were not separated by an interval of
time. For the above statement there has been substituted in Mark the statement that Jesus had gone into Galilee. There can surely be no doubt as to which is the earlier.2 We
1 Aetatem seniorem (Contra haer., II, 22).
* There is evidence in the Epistle of Barnabas, § 16, that originally
the Resurrection and Ascension were believed to have taken place
upon the same day.



THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL 243
may infer that in the Primitive Gospel Jesus came straight
down from Heaven, " whence he was sent." And the inference is decidedly confirmed by the opening section of Mark. The best critics agree that the birth-stories in Matthew and Luke are late and unhistorical.1 The writer of the Primitive Gospel had nothing to say upon the subject, not because all the relevant circumstances had been com pletely forgotten, which is unlikely; nor for the still more unlikely reason that neither he nor his readers took any interest in the origin of so important and remarkable a person ; but because the Son of God could not be supposed to have had an infancy and boyhood upon the earth.
2. The Baptism of Jesus
The originality of the account of the baptism of Jesus may be doubted. There was evidently a controversy among early Christians with regard to the significance and importance of
baptism. Jn. xiii, 10, seems to contain a polemic against some who attached a mystical or symbolic significance to
total immersion. " He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every whit." Rejection of the Pauline view of baptism is implied. Total immersion was
probably at first the general—though not universal —rule in the Christian communities; and the desire to confront objectors with a divine authorization of the rule may have been the motive for the insertion into the Gospel of an account of the baptism of Jesus. We may infer a motive because we have evidence in the Gospel according to the Hebrews that the baptism of Jesus by John was felt to be an
incongruity. The writer of Matthew also thought it neces sary to give some plausible explanation of it. On the other hand the most eminent critics are aware of the fact that not only speeches of Jesus but also incidents were inserted into
the Gospels for a controversial or dogmatic purpose. If this baptism had really happened one might have expected that
1 Guignebert wrote : " Neither of these two accounts of the
Nativity will bear critical examination, and it is obvious that neither
is founded upon an authentic original tradition." Jesus, p. 93.



244 THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL
Paul, for whom baptism was so very important, would have
made some allusion to it ; and if his Jesus had been a man there is no reason why he should not have done so. The writer of the Fourth Gospel never hesitates to sup press or to transform circumstances related by the other
Evangelists when his own opinion requires it. It is most unlikely that he would have recounted an episode which was in conflict with his view of baptism. Moreover the
Johannine Jesus, as the Logos, an emanation from God —in
effect himself the Spirit of God —did not require that the Spirit should descend upon him. No passage in the Fourth Gospel in which the Holy Spirit is distinguished from the Father and the Son appears to be original. Since the Gospel was very freely Catholicized it is more likely that the account of the baptism was introduced later into it than that it is primitive. Schmiedel has pointed out that the baptism of Jesus is not categorically affirmed in this Gospel and that the descent of the Spirit takes place for the enlightenment of
John. That is true, though the baptism is implied in verse 29. The writer of this section may have intended to modify the Synoptic account, with which he was presumably
acquainted ; but for several reasons it is extremely doubtful whether the section is primitive. Verse 31 implies that
Jesus was the Jewish Messiah. John cannot have written that; but the verse may be a later interpolation into the section. There is textual evidence that the section is not original.
The repetition of the phrase " Behold the Lamb of God " in
verses 29 and 36 has an artificial appearance ; and if one of
these verses was written by John and the other not, it is verse
29 which must be rejected ; for the phrase, " which taketh away the sin of the world," is not an expression of Johannine doctrine. Verses 29, 35, and 43 all begin with the words
" On the morrow." Now verses 19 to 28 record a conversa tion which is supposed to have taken place on a certain day ;
verses 29 to 34 record the coming of Jesus to John, which would thus have occurred the next day; verses 35 to 42 circumstances which are said to have happened on the third day ; and verses 43 to 51 an incident which is referred to the



THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL 245
fourth day. Quibbles apart, the following day would be the
fifth; and yet chapter ii begins with the words, " And the third day." Inferably two sections have been inserted of which for the reasons stated one is likely to have been verses
29 to 34. Even if we begin to count from the day referred to in verse 29, one section has been inserted. Now Mark is a considerably amplified version of the Primitive Gospel, so that there are a priori grounds for suspecting that any incident which is not consistent with its
fundamental doctrine is not original. If the account of the
baptism was inserted into one Gnostic Gospel it is at least
conceivable that it was inserted into the other. It is even probable; because in the Primitive Gospel Jesus was the pre-existent Son of God and as such in no need of being
baptized or of the descent of the Holy Spirit upon him. A writer who emphasized the contrast between John's baptism with water and the baptism by Jesus with the Holy Spirit is not likely to have thought that Jesus required a water bap tism . Here again the supposition is confirmed by indications
of manipulation of the text in Mark at this point. In i, 14, we
read : " Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Gospel of God." This would be a very suitable commencement of the narrative so far as Jesus is concerned. We need not ask whence he came. The verse implies that Jesus was not habitually residing in Galilee at
that time, whereas verse 9 does imply it ; and in the mean while only the forty days' absence in the wilderness is
recorded. Jesus is said to have gone there " straightway " after the baptism.1 Pertinent questions in this connection
are : Was John " delivered up " during the forty days ?
Verse 14 seems to imply not. But, if not, what was Jesus doing and where was he staying in the meantime ? The Baptist foretells the coming of Jesus and then quite naturally in verse 14 he disappears from the stage and Jesus arrives.
1 Raschke, Die Werkstatt des Markusevangelisten, p. 75, gave
reasons for concluding that the account of the Temptation is not
original in Mark. It is an abridgement of the account in Matthew
and apparently dependent upon it. In the opinion of most modern
critics the story was taken from the source Q, and therefore inferably
not in the Primitive Gospel.



246 THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL
The announcement of John that Jesus is to come after him
corresponds better with this order of events than with a simultaneous appearance which must have continued for
an appreciable length of time if the delivering up of John
occurred later than the forty days in the wilderness. It
would be strange if Jesus emerged merely to be baptized and then retired into obscurity until John was delivered up. Such a delay would not, in fact, be consistent with the first verse of the Gospel which leads us to expect the public appearance of Jesus very soon. The implication is that the
activity of John had already occurred. It is mentioned incidentally, and the Gospel proper begins with the appear ance of Jesus in verse 14. The fact that in Mark there is no kind of apology for allowing Jesus to be baptized rather points to the insertion of the section at a time when people's minds had become familiarized with the idea. Notwithstanding the deceptive art of the writer the Gospel of Mark is as little like a record of real events as is the Gospel of John. Consider the immediately following section which describes the calling of the first disciples. The Son of God would be imagined to make disciples in such a manner, but not a man. The introduction of a few details to give an appearance of actuality is an artistic device which would be
employed by any competent writer of a narrative. And,
since really there is no " actuality " in the incident, there is no reason to suppose that the writer did not represent Peter
and Andrew as " fishers " in order to symbolize the fact that
they were to become " fishers of men."
3. The Purpose op the Descent of the Son
of God
To pass from the locally and temporally undefined idea
that the Christ had " appeared upon earth " and been
" conversant with men " to a detailed representation of his appearance was a natural step for symbolizing Gnostics to
take. It then became necessary to decide upon a place and purpose for his appearance. The first Christians having been Jews, Palestine was indicated as the obviously appropriate place. Galilee was chosen for the fulfilment



THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL 247
of a prophecy of Isaiah [ix, 1, 2].1 To discover the pur
pose we must consult the early Christian writers, and the view of the Primitive Gospel should be discoverable in Mark. Since the time of the appearance of Jesus is not stated by the second Evangelist we may infer that that still remained indeterminate. We have not to penetrate far into tbe Gospel in our search for the purpose; the writer gives a clear in timation of it in the very first section in which the subject is treated. This he does not only by making the act of heahng there described the first exercise of the divine power of the
Son of God, but also in the words ascribed to the unclean
spirit—" Thou hast come to destroy us." And the great importance attached to this exercise of divine power be
comes increasingly apparent as we proceed. " And he went
throughout all Galilee preaching and casting out devils "
(i,
39); "And cast out many devils "
(i,
34); "And the unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down
before him" (iii, 11). In chapter v we read of the expulsion
of a " legion " of unclean spirits. When the twelve are sent
out " they cast out many devils," and that
is
evidently regarded as their most important work. How
is
it
that commentators find so little difficulty in this representation
?
Granting that belief in demoniacal possession was universal in those days, and that a healer would be supposed occasionally to exorcise, what a strange picture of the state of the Galilean population
is
here presented
!
Swarms of devil-ridden people everywhere
!
And how astonishing that the principal work of the Son of God and his disciples should be the expelling of daemons from a number of lunatics and epileptics
!
All this
is
most unnatural. What does
it
mean
?
Can the writer really have thought that the Son of God had come down from Heaven for the purpose of destroy ing daemons of this particular kind
?
Let us now inquire of the Christian writers of the second century what in their opinion was the chief purpose of Jesus
in coming into the world. In the Greek version of the

248 THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL
Apology of Aristides it is written that the Son of God became incarnate that he might recall men from the polytheistic error. Tertullian1 says that the mission of Christ was not like that of Numa to frighten boors with a multitude of gods, but to open the eyes of highly cultured men to a knowledge of the truth— obviously to convert them to monotheism. The Apologies of Aristides and of Minucius Felix consist almost entirely of an argument for monotheism versus polytheism.
If any one thinks I have exaggerated the importance attached by Mark to the expulsion of daemons let him listen to Justin
(Second Apol. 6) :
Jesus has the name and significance both of man and
Saviour. For a man was he made according to the counsel
of the God and Father, brought forth for the sake of believing
men and for the dissolution of the dasmons.
So, according to Justin, Jesus became man in order to
liberate believing men from the daemons. The liberation of
course followed from the belief. And Justin, in his first Apology, 5, and elsewhere, says categorically that the Pagan
gods are the dasmons whom Jesus had come to destroy. It
is obvious from these statements of Justin and those of the
other writers quoted that " dissolution of the daemons " means precisely the same thing as the overthrow of poly
theism. A passage quoted previously from the Recognitions proves that every Pagan was believed to be possessed by an evil spirit, and the identity of Pagan gods with daemons is
unambiguously declared in 1 Cor. x, 20, " the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils." No wonder
that Galilee — " Galilee of the Gentiles," hence probably a
symbol of the Gentile world—was swarming with demoniacs. But the daemons whom Jesus had come to destroy were not those which caused physical incapacity or mental alienation ; they were the far more to be dreaded corrupters of the soul.
The inner meaning of the cry of the unclean spirit— " Thou
hast come to destroy us "—is clear. Mark did not believe that the Son of God was a psychiatrist, but he himself was a symbolist. The name of the place where the first healing

THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL 249
occurred accords with the symbolic character of the episode.
The statements of ancient writers as to the situation of Capernaum are contradictory, and Biblical archaeologists are unable to agree with regard to it. The name is not found in any existing document older than the Gospels; 1 but Josephus 2 says that there was a fountain called Capernaum not far from the Lake of Gennesareth. This statement, read in connection with two verses of Zechariah [xiii, 1, 2], is
illuminating :
In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house
of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for
uncleanness. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith
the Lord, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of
the land.
The writer appropriately gave to the place where the work of cutting off the names of the idols and putting an end to uncleanness was supposed to have begun the name of a fountain. The place itself was in the land, not of Galilee, but of phantasy. The first case of healing of this kind is located in a synagogue ; but that is exceptional. Jews were as liable to mental derangement as Gentiles, but they were not spiritually sick in the same way. And yet they were not all completely
" clean." As we have seen, Christians reproached Jews with
their worship of angels and of " stoicheia." Aristides wrote
concerning the Jews :
Nevertheless they too have gone astray from accurate
knowledge, and they suppose in their minds that they are
serving God; but in the method of their actions their
service is to angels and not to God, in that they observe
Sabbaths and new moons, and the Passover, and the great
fast, and the fast, and circumcision, and cleanness of meats.
Hence we need not be surprised to find one unclean spirit
in a synagogue. A man with a withered hand is healed in a

synagogue. With regard to that incident Jerome wrote in
his commentary on Matthew :
Up to the advent of the Saviour the hand was dry in the
synagogue of the Jews, and works of God were not done in
it; after he came to earth the right hand was returned to
the Jews that believed on the apostles and was restored to
service.
If in the Primitive Gospel casting out daemons was
symbolism, it would be illogical not to conclude that the multitude of miraculous cures, in the literal truth of which no critical theologian believes to-day, are also symbolism. They were introduced for the sake of diversity but their meaning is
substantially the same. Jesus himself says (ii, 17) : " They
that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick." And plainly he is not speaking of physical sickness. The attitude of the writer to the Old Testament was similar to that of the Odist. He never quotes a text for the purpose
of proving that his Jesus was the Messiah —his Jesus was in
fact not the Messiah —and quotations of any kind from that
source are in Mark so extremely rare that it is doubtful whether in the Primitive Gospel there were any.1 But the writer could apply, without quoting, a verse from the Prophets as a basis for his imagery. And it seems likely that the curative activity of Jesus was suggested by Isa.
xxxv, 5, 6 :
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears
of the* deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man
leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing.
In the Prophets idolatry is so frequently described as
" uncleanness " that the writer was not likely to overlook leprosy as a fitting symbol for it. Since Jesus did not, on any hypothesis, personally destroy
the " daemons " ; and did not, even if historical, convert any Pagans to belief in his own divinity, we must conclude that in
1 In the Gnostic Pauline Epistles there are no quotations from
the Old Testament. The presence or absence of such quotations
serves as a means of discrimination between strata of different
origin.



THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL 251
the allegorical representation of the overthrow of polytheism by the Son of God the operation of the divine Son is supposed by the writer to be effected through the community which is his visible body. The writer, indeed, in contemplating the extinction of polytheism must have been thinking more of the future than the present, to say nothing of the past.
4. The Son of God a Saviour
The Primitive Gospel must have been considerably shorter
even than the existing Mark. It is perhaps not possible to
reconstruct it ; but it is possible to decide that certain sec tions were contained in it and that certain others were not.
It is known, for example, that " the Little Apocalypse " (Mk. xiii, 14-27) is a rather late insertion into the Gospel.
Even if that were not demonstrable on critical grounds we could confidently decide that no eschatological passages can
have originally formed part of a Gnostic work. The critics are agreed that the discourses of Jesus found in Matthew
were taken from a collection —or collections —of " Sayings " (Logia), which, therefore, were not in the Primitive Gospel. Now
if,
as many theologians maintain, Jesus was primarily an ethical teacher and in his teaching lies his supreme value to the world, how extraordinary
it
is
that the writer of the Primitive Gospel, who presumably was in
a
better position to estimate the significance of his life and was likely to be more
under the influence of his " personality " than those who wrote later, had no more to tell about the ethical teaching of Jesus than the writers of the earliest Epistles. And why
have the Apologists —except Justin, who quotes from a
Gospel —nothing to say about his teaching
?
True, we are
told in Mark that he taught the people " many things." But teaching many things does not prima facie signify the in
culcation of morality, and in fact the example of the teaching which immediately follows
is
not a sermon but the parable
of " the Sower," of which more anon. Jesus
is
also said to
have " preached "
;
but the subject of his preaching was not morality,
it
was the " Kingdom of God "
;
and the subject was expounded in parables which not even the disciples could



252 THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL
understand. Next after the miracles it is these parables which we can most confidently ascribe to the primitive
document. And it is impossible to detach from them
the statement with which the series concludes (Mk. iv,
33, 34) :
And with many such parables spake he the word unto them,
as they were able to hear it ; and without a parable spake he
not unto them.
All the ingenious wriggling of theological critics has been unable to pervert the plain meaning of this statement, which is that in the Primitive Gospel no straightforward unambiguous talking by Jesus to the people was recorded. Esoteric doctrine is indicated, and that is quite consistent
with the symbolic character of the Gospel. In the Christian
communities no doubt morality was inculcated and " Sayings
of the Lord " were compiled by the teachers or " prophets "
for that purpose. But the Gnostic Son of God did not come to teach morality ; he came to save. Dr. Bacon has observed that the explanation of the parable
of " the Sower " does not give the meaning originally
intended by the parable, but " an allegorizing application intended to rebuke various classes of hearers." Dr. Bacon's
opinion is certainly correct. The " word " which is " sown "
in the parable (Mk. iv, 3-8) is not verbal instruction ; it is the
Logos, and the sower is God. The parable describes in a
different metaphor the stifling or the killing of the Logos of which we read in the doctrine of the Naassenes. The con ception of the Logos as the seed of God was current in the first
century, applied, however, in different ways.1 In Poimandres
the " Will of God " receives the Logos, from which then as
from a seed the cosmos is produced. In Corp. Herm. XD7 we
find a doctrine which approximates more closely to that of
the parable. Here again the sower is the " Will of God," but
the seed is " the true good " from which proceeds the rebirth
of the pneumatic people. It cannot, we are told, be taught ;
it is indefinable and must be grasped through itself—i.e.,
1 Justin, Apol., I, 32, terms the Logos the seed of God.



THE PRIMrnVE GOSPEL 253
intuitively. This is the Gnostic doctrine of Logos and Gnosis. Salvation comes, not from instruction or from doing
any " good thing," but from intuitive knowledge of the indwelling Logos, the Son of God, whence follows knowledge of the one true God.
The " historical " Jesus cannot have taught that the in dispensable condition of salvation was mystical union with,
or even " belief in," himself. For belief in Jesus meant belief in his divinity and his power to save. But in the pericope, Mk. x, 17-22, Jesus, after reciting the command ments, gives the young man who had questioned him clearly to understand that keeping the commandments is not
sufficient for salvation. In order to secure eternal life it is
necessary to " follow me." And the necessity is more
peremptorily insisted on in verses 23-31. " Following
Jesus " cannot mean following his example, for that would be mere morality, which had just been declared to be insufficient.
Nor can the " following " have been literally meant. If
Jesus really believed that the only means by which a man could secure eternal life was to strip himself of all he possessed and follow him about in his peregrinations through Galilee there is justification for the opinion of those who have thought that he was crazy. The demand that anyone who wished to follow him must begin by beggaring himself is unreasonable. The demand is not an exceptional one
addressed to a particular " rich man " ; for the poor disciples
(x, 30) are promised " eternal life " because they had " left
all " and followed Jesus. Again, in viii, 34, it is said that Jesus, having called unto him the multitude, said unto
them, " If any man would come after me, let him deny
himself and take up his cross, and follow me." In none of these cases can the words quoted ever have been spoken by
any " teacher." They are the words of a Christian writer,
for whom " following Jesus " meant becoming a Christian.
Literally understood, there is no " actuality " in the episode
of the Rich Young Man. It is a piece of symbolism which was explained by W. B. Smith.1 The meaning of the
demand is that the Jew should give up the privileges which

254 THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL
were his pride and share with the Gentile —the poor —i.e., become a Christian.1
In Matthew Jesus has been humanized and has become a teacher in the more general sense of the term. The Logos
Hermes, another Son of God, was a " teacher." He too
taught " many things," some of them very enigmatically, as
we learn from the Corpus Hermeticum. But he, like the Gnostic Christ, was a Saviour, and he taught, not morality, but mystical lore, such as we may suppose to have been
taught to " the perfect " in the esoteric doctrine of the Gnostic Christian communities.
5. Esoteeism
Esoterism was a common feature of early religions. In ancient times when the thinking of select men had risen above
the superstitious mentality of the multitude some sort of compromise with traditional belief became necessary. No doubt the more enlightened thinkers desired as far as possible to preserve traditional forms, partly perhaps from the natural conservatism of the human mind ; but also because they had to take into account the possible danger with which the publication of heterodox opinions in religion might be attended. Traditional forms could be invested with a new significance; but even in free-thinking Greece philosophic interpretation of myths was at one time unsafe, and among
more superstitious people it remained so. Consequently new views in religion had to be expressed in esoteric doctrine reserved for the few who had been carefully prepared for its reception. As early as 1500 B.C. there was in Babylon an
esoteric priestly doctrine of monotheism. In Egypt also at a very early date there grew up an esoteric doctrine which, while nominally preserving the popular polytheism, had
grafted upon it a system which was pantheistic rather than monotheistic. The names of the Egyptian deities were re tained but were held to be names of one divine being, who, however, being identified with the cosmos, might manifest
1 Cp. the story of the rich man (the Jew) and Lazarus (the Gentile).
The " great possessions " of the Jew are recorded in Rom. ix, 4, 5.



THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL 255
himself in different forms to which particular names were appropriate. Both the Babylonian and the Egyptian esoteric doctrines were more or less metaphysical and as such beyond the reach of the average man. The same may
be said of the early Gnostic Christianity. The number of men and women capable of loving an abstraction was probably not a larger proportion of the whole then than it is now. Multitudes of people could and did love Attis and Tammuz, and women could weep for them at the season when
they were supposed to have died. If Christianity had been unable to offer to the ancient world a humanized Jesus Christ as a man of like emotions to their own, and particularly as one who for the sake of mankind had been poor, despised, and maltreated, Hermes, Osiris, Adonis, and their like would probably not all have been dethroned. We may suppose that in the early Gnostic Christian communities there were people of limited imagination who would interpret such a work as the Odes of Solomon literally,
as theologians are apt to do to-day, and believe that the Word
had actually " appeared." The explanation of the sym bolism might then become esoteric doctrine. And we may predicate the same of the Primitive Gospel. Theologians are mostly of the opinion that the Gospel was composed before
the end of the first century. The opinion is very likely correct ; but the first indubitable evidence of the existence
of any Gospel is in the commentary of the Gnostic Basilides* (ca. 135 c.E.). After that date knowledge of it seems to have
spread rapidly, followed by a multiplication of Gospels. In
the meanwhile it must have been known only to a few.
" Clement of Rome " was acquainted with " Sayings " of Jesus, but there is no evidence in his Epistle to the Corinthians that he had ever seen a Gospel. From information given by Irenaeus with regard to the opinions of the Gnostic Cerinthus, who was teaching early in the second century, we can infer
that he was acquainted with a Gospel. It is somewhat doubtful whether all the opinions ascribed by Irenaeus to
Cerinthus were really held by him. But if he was acquainted with a Gospel the fact is evidence of the correctness of the
opinion that it originated among Gnostics and for a con



256 THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL
siderable time was known only to them. Its true character would, of course, be known to the Gnostics who used it. Men of their kind were very well used to symbolic interpretation, though it is possible that the explanation was reserved for an inner group of initiates. Some Pauline expressions are explicable only on the supposition that there was esoteric doctrine in the communities for which the Epistles were
written. For example, " We speak wisdom among the
perfect." This word " perfect " (teleioi) was the regular
technical term in that age for the higher grade of initiates, for whom was reserved teaching of a secret character, not to be divulged to those who were unfit to receive it, which would have been a casting of pearls before swine. Consider further
these words from the same Epistle : " Which things we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual." We ought not to modernize expressions of that kind ; their meaning can be better appreciated from a know ledge of the phraseology of Philo, who wrote, after explaining
a verse of Genesis 1 :
That is the obvious interpretation of it, for the many;
there is, however, a secret one for the few who examine with
reference to the spirit and not according to the material
form.
The writer of 1 Cor.
ii,
13, was a Gnostic and for him, as
for Philo, " spiritual " in connection with exegesis could
have one meaning only—that is, " symbolic " as opposed
to " literal." Consider now that verse in Mark [iv, 11]:
And he said unto them, Unto you
is
given the mystery of
the Kingdom of God
;
but unto them that are without all
things are done in parables
—which has so perplexed theologians. How could Jesus have deliberately taught in such a way as to conceal his meaning from his hearers
?
Surely this
is
a plain intimation that in the Gnostic circle in which the Primitive Gospel originated there was esoteric doctrine which only an inner

THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL 257
group of disciples were allowed to understand. To Philo's evidence of contemporary reservation of esoteric doctrine for the initiated may be added the following from 2 Esdras
xiv, 26 : " Write. And when thou hast done, some things shalt thou publish openly, and some things shalt thou deliver in secret to the wise." When the Gospel became more widely known and other Gospels were written in which the humanization of Jesus proceeded rapidly, the primitive allegory was inevitably literalized into the life-story of a divine being who had actually become a man and even been born in a supernatural
manner from a human mother. For a time the literal view did not supplant the symbolic, at least among Gnostics, but
it steadily encroached upon it, until at the beginning of the third century the two views were subsisting side by side, as we may learn from the commentaries of Origen. There can
be no doubt at all that with Origen " speaking wisdom " was symbolic interpretation, not only of the Old Testament, but
even of the New. For he begins his commentary upon John
with the words : " It is necessary to Christianize pneu
matically and materially "—i.e., symbolically and literally,
as he himself explains. " What," he asks, " is exegesis
of the obvious if not its transformation into spiritual ? " And in his own exegesis he illustrates his symbolic method
abundantly. For example, he explains the phrase, " The
Word was in the beginning " to mean that " the Logos was
in Sophia, because Sophia [Wisdom] was the beginning "; 1
and he interprets the statement of John the Baptist— " In
the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not "—as a declaration of the fact that the universal Logos, established everywhere by the Father, stands as a guiding principle in the midst of the body, in the heart, of men. This is primitive Gnostic Christian doctrine to which Origen was accommo dating the later Gospel story. Origen in his writings hints
more than once at secret lore reserved for a few, especially in
his work against Celsus, III, 59, where he says, "Then and not
till then we invite them to our mysteries, for we speak wisdom
1 We may suppose the thought of Origen to have been that the
Wisdom of God must have preceded the utterance of it.



258 THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL
among the perfect." Jerome, as we have seen, also inter preted the miracles of the New Testament, and not only the
miracles, symbolically. A Christian writer of his mentality could use the method without questioning the literal truth of the statements so interpreted; but a logical modern must
necessarily decide that, if a writing is symbolism, allegory, or
fable, it cannot at the same time be literally true.1 There can, however, be no doubt about the scepticism of Origen, for he said plainly that the Evangelists have written some things contrary to historical fact, since their aim was to teach
spiritual as well as literal truth. If he could make such a statement as that publicly we may imagine the liberty which he probably allowed himself in his esoteric doctrine.
6. The Mother and the Brethren
In the second century, when the Catholic Church in its conflict with Docetism had compelling reasons for stressing
the real humanity of Jesus, it supplied him with brothers, but in the Primitive Gospel, as was befitting for the Son of God, he was parentless. Joseph is never named in Mark as the father of Jesus, and the solitary verse in which Mary is
named as his mother is demonstrably an interpolation. In
xv, 40, 41, we read, " Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome, who, when he was in Galilee, followed and ministered unto him." , Obviously this Mary was not the
mother of Jesus. In the next chapter (xvi, 1) it is said that
" Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, brought spices." There can be no doubt, both from the sequence of events and from the coupling with Salome,
that this is the same Mary, who, if she had been the mother of
Jesus, would certainly have been so described. In another
passage where Mary the mother of Joses is mentioned it is evident from the context that she was not the mother of Jesus. So in all three passages it is implied that Mary the
1 It is not absolutely certain that Jerome accepted everything in
the Gospel without question. A German critic, Rudolf Handmann,
has said of him that, for the preservation of his reputation for
orthodoxy, he was always ready to sacrifice to the Church his own
free opinion.



THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL 259
mother of James and Joses was not the mother of Jesus.
Now, in vi, 3, the question is asked : " Is not this the carpenter,
the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses ? " Were there then two Marys, both of whom had sons named James and Joses ? Possible, no doubt, though rather improbable. Consider further the names of the brothers mentioned in the same verse, James and Judas and Simon. Here is another
remarkable coincidence. Josephus (Antiq., XX, v, 2) says
that James and Simon, the sons of Judas the Galilean, were crucified. The double coincidence must create in the mind of any unprejudiced person a very strong impression of artificiality. And the impression is decidedly deepened by a consideration of the verse as a whole. What motive prompted this recital of names ? Jesus, it is implied, was well known to the people addressed. To have referred to him as the son of Mary would have been sufficient and more than
sufficient. Is it not more reasonable to suppose that the verse was inserted for the confutation of Gnostics who denied the real humanity of Jesus and his human birth, and that the questions were aimed at them ? 1 Furthermore, Origen in his work against Celsus says that Jesus is not called a car penter in any Gospel current in the churches, whence we must conclude that the passage was not in his copy of Mark.
In estimating the probability of the authenticity of this verse, we ought to take into account the character of the Gospel as a whole, especially the absence of a birth-story and
the manner in which it begins. Any reason whatever for suspecting the originality of the verse reinforces, and is reinforced by, the reasonable presumption that the sudden appearance of the Son of God in Galilee was intended by the writer to indicate his descent from Heaven. The existence
of that belief among Gnostic Christians is proved by Phil,
ii,
6-8. A careful consideration of the pericope leads to the con clusion that
it
is
as devoid of " actuality " as the one
previously examined. It
is
said that "

The naming of Mary with the ignoring of Joseph seems to carry
a dogmatic implication which points to a Christian writer, not to the
inhabitants of a Galilean town.



260 THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL
without honour, save in his own country." But as a matter of fact the question is not merely one of the honouring of a prophet ; it is principally one of belief in the power of Jesus
to do " mighty works " ; and according to verse 2 that belief
existed. Is it credible that the sick people of "his own country," and their friends and relations, having heard of the marvellous cures effected by Jesus elsewhere and believing, as we are told they did, in his power to do mighty works, would
have refused to profit by it ? A physician who has acquired a great reputation will not lack patients among his own towns folk. The writer of this Gospel was not stupid. He was very intelligent. What again is the explanation of the apparent contradiction between the statements that Jesus could do no
mighty work and that he did heal some sick folk ? If he healed any we may be sure that the rest would have flocked
to him. It is supposed by some that the second of the two
statements is a later addition. But perhaps if we under stood the writer's meaning the apparent contradiction would
disappear. In any case the question is unimportant. The main point of the passage is the inability of Jesus to do
mighty works in " his own country." But if he had done them elsewhere he could have done them there. We must
look beyond the modern " historical " view of Jesus to the intention of the writer, whose Jesus was first and foremost a
wonder-worker, and, more than that, one whose power, if he
chose to exercise it, could not, assuming the miracles of healing to be physical, have been limited by want of faith in others. Reasons have been given for concluding that Mark was a symbolist. The conclusion is confirmed by the statement in
this pericope that Jesus " could not " in certain circum stances do mighty works. We are now considering, not
the Jesus of modern liberal theology, but the Jesus of Mark, the Son of God, who by his mere word was able to calm a
storm. If the mighty works had been physical, that Jesus, who was not the faith-healer imagined by some theologians,
could have healed anyone whom he wished to heal. And it
is not said that he " would not," but that he " could not."
It follows that if we take this healing to be the literal healing



THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL 261
of physical diseases we must be completely failing to grasp the meaning and the purpose of the story. Critics endeavour
to explain this episode by vague talk about " an unfruitful
patch at Nazareth." But when we inquire what they mean by this, it becomes evident that they are simply setting aside the narrative of the Evangelist and substituting one which shall be consistent with their own presupposition as to the
character of Jesus and his work—a mere begging of the question. What we have to do is to find some reasonable explanation which will be in accordance with the character of the Gospel.
" His own country " has usually been taken to mean
Nazareth. But it is very doubtful whether in the first century there was a Galilean village named Nazareth. Cheyne 1 argued that Nazareth was another name for Galilee. The name occurs once only in Mark
[i,
9], and as
it
is
absent from the corresponding verse of Matthew [iii, 13], good critics have concluded that
it
is
an interpolation.2 Moreover, the Greek word patris properly means, as
it
is
translated in the English New Testament, country. Native city would be patris polis.
A
satisfying explanation of the passage in
question should account for this term. It has already been shown that in the Primitive Gospel the healing of diseases and the casting out of daemons symbolized the conversion of Jews and Pagans to Christianity. The Son of God Jesus
being an outcome of the theosophical speculation of Jews, the
Jews could be symbolically styled his kinsfolk, and Palestine,
or Judaea, " his own country." The scene of the episode
is
not named Nazareth in Mark. Jews who were afflicted by physical ailments could have had no objection to submitting themselves to a Jew who had proved his ability to heal
;
but in the view of the Christian writer the ailments of the Jews were spiritual ailments which could be cured only by
" faith "—that
is
to say, by believing in the redemptive power of the Christian Son of God. Faith, in that sense, was
of course a prerequisite to their being healed. But the

262 THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL
" historical " Jesus could not have demanded that kind of faith. His divinity is implied. Presupposing, as we must,
the writer's own conception of Jesus, it is only thus that we
can find a reasonable explanation of the inability of Jesus to
do any " mighty work " among " his own people." " Mighty
work " would in any case be an extravagant phrase for the literal healing of the sick in an age when the laws of physio logy were little known and people were very ready to believe in the possibility of far greater wonders. Conversion of Pagans to Christianity was spiritually of sufficient importance
to be called a mighty work ; but of course it was done by the spiritual Son of God acting through the Christian community, not by Jesus in person.1 When Mk. vi, 3, has been excluded from the Gospel, there remains one passage only in which the mother and brothers of Jesus are mentioned (iii, 31-35), and that in a very peculiar
way. The mother and brethren are said to be " standing
without," and Jesus practically disowns them. It is im possible to see in this episode the meek and lowly Jesus of popular imagination. Indeed it is only when interpreted
as symbolism that the incident ceases to be offensive. ' In
a man the conduct is not admirable. If, as is usually supposed, the mother and the brethren are the relations (ol trap' avrov) mentioned in verse 21, the implication is that
Jesus publicly renounced his own mother because she did not believe in him. Marcion adduced the passage (32-35) as
evidence that the Jesus of Mark was motherless ; 2 and certainly, especially in conjunction with other evidence of the same import, it can be so understood. Some early Christian writers had in certain respects a better appreciation of the character of the Gospel narrative than modern commen tators have. Jerome concluded that the mother of Jesus in the Fourth Gospel is a symbol of the Jewish Christian Church, which, as he thought, was the mother church of the Christian
1 Loisy (Le Quatr. Ev., p. 239) wrote : " Does not the ill success
of Christ in his own country symbolize the ill success of the Christian >

communities, and that the brothers of Jesus symbolize the heads of that Church. The interpretation fits the passage of Mark very well, except that perhaps we should rather take the mother of this passage to represent the Jewish religion. Tertullian understood the passage in this sense; for he
wrote 1 :
In another connection there lies hidden in the aloofness
of the mother a symbol of the synagogue, and in the brethren
a symbol of the Jews. In their person stood Israel without ;
the new disciples within symbolize the Church.
In the Odes of Solomon the congregation of saints is named
the Kingdom of God; and in Mark the Kingdom of the parables is evidently the Christian community, growing from a small and obscure beginning into a large and wide
spreading organization, coming " not with observation " and
already when the parables were composed " among you." 2 Obviously Jesus himself could not have so described the Kingdom. We may infer, as Tertullian did, that tha
multitude sitting about Jesus in Mk. iii, 32, are the members
of the community, the components of the Kingdom. It is, then, perfectly natural that the Gnostic writer of the Primi tive Gospel, or the Hellenistic writer of Mark, should have represented the mother and the brethren as being outside and have declared through the mouth of Jesus that his Christ claimed no particular spiritual relationship with the Jews or with the leaders of the Judaic Christian Church. There appears to be an intimate connection between verses 20, 21, and 32 which is broken by the irrelevant episode contained in the intervening passage, which accordingly may with probability be inferred not to have formed part of the
Primitive Gospel. It is believed by some critics to have been
in the source Q. If so, it is not original in Mark. The

* The translation " within you " favoured by some liberal theo
logians is impossible, since the words were addressed to the Pharisees.
The translation is not consistent with the description of the Kingdom
in the parables, and the form " among you " is confirmed by the
Sinaitic Syriac in which it appears without any ambiguity. The
notion that the Kingdom of God could be " within you " is altogether
modern and could not have occurred to anyone in the first century.



284 THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL
reconstruction of Q is, however, very hypothetical. A
passage common to Matthew, Mark, and Luke could have been transferred from the former into both of the latter.
Mt. xxiii is assigned by the Rev. J. M. C. Crum 1 to the source
Q; but some commentators better acquainted with the Pharisaism of the first two centuries than he appears to be have decided that the denunciation of the Pharisees was written in the second century. The chapter is found in Luke, with some omissions, dislocated, and modified. We may conclude that Matthew was his source. Now three verses (Mt. xxiii, 5-7), and three only, are found in Mark [xii, 38,
39] ; and since they stand in Mark in the corresponding place
to that which is occupied by the whole chapter of Matthew,
it is hardly possible to doubt that they were taken from that Gospel. They were certainly borrowed, because in the three verses in Matthew there is no indication of the persons against whom the accusations were made; so that the
copyist had to introduce the word " scribes," presumably from Mt. xxiii, 2. He has also altered, or omitted, expres sions in the three verses which would be intelligible only to Jewish readers.
It is therefore quite possible that Mk. iii, 22-30, was in troduced from Matthew. W. B. Smith pointed out that the
term " the Holy Spirit " (to irvevfux to ayiov) is rare in Mark,
occurring only in this passage (iii, 29) and xii, 36, and xiii, 11.
The latter two verses are in the account of the week spent by Jesus in Jerusalem, which, in the opinion of some good critics, was not contained in the Primitive Gospel. Chapter
xiii is admittedly late. There is no reason to believe that the episode recorded in iii, 22-30, is historical. The Jews them selves practised exorcism. No Jew could have had any
ground for saying that another Jew who did the same thing was casting out devils by the prince of the devils, unless in
his formula of exorcism he used the name of a daemon. In
Matthew Jesus makes the pertinent retort : " By whom,
then, do your sons cast them out ? " The reproach of the Scribes seems to reflect the consciousness of a time when hostility between Christians and Jews had arisen and when 1 The Original Jerusalem Gospel, pp. 96 ff.



THE PRIMITIVE GOSPEL 265
Jews could be represented as ascribing to the agency of Beelzebul the progress of a religion which they believed to
have been founded upon falsehood. If, however, the section
was written in the second century it may reproduce an assertion actually made by uncritical and credulous Jews who believed that exorcism had been successfully practised by a wonder-working Jesus. Christians were credulous enough to believe that Simon Magus had been a wonder worker and were accordingly convinced that he was a sorcerer.
It is not necessary to repeat here the arguments by which has been demonstrated the improbability of the application
of the title " Brother of the Lord " to James in a literal sense.
It is sufficient to observe that if in any genuinely early Epistle James had been called the brother of Jesus, there would have been evidence of the relationship. But seeing
that the title " the Lord " would in the first century have been given only to a divine being who could not be supposed
to have had brothers in the flesh, it is far more likely that
the " Brothers of the Lord " were a small group of men
of exceptional piety in one of the Christian—presumably
Judaic —communities.

CHAPTER IX
CONCLUSION
1. Period of Co-ordination
Up to the time of the capture of Jerusalem by Titus, the Christian communities and the worshippers of a sacrificed Jesus were sects of the Jews. There was as yet no Christian
" Church." The church at Jerusalem of which we read in
Acts was a Judaic community, and James, the head of it, was so far from being regarded by Jews in general as the leader of an unfriendly sect that, as Hegesippus informs us, he frequented the Temple, praying constantly for his own people, and was allowed in consequence of his reputation for extraordinary piety to enter once a year into the Holy
of Holies. Even if the information given by Hegesippus is
not in every respect accurate it is clear from what he says that James had not separated himself from the national religion. We must, of course, suppose that the community of which he was the head held some opinions which dis
tinguished it from Jews in general ; but it is evident from the statements of Josephus that the death of James was the work of a clique headed by a Sadducee named Ananus, the High Priest, of whom Josephus expresses a very unfavourable opinion.1 The other persons who were stoned with James were presumably members of his community, but Josephus apparently had no reason to suppose that they were not
1 Antiq. XX, be, 1. In this passage occur the words " the brother
of Jesus, who was called Christ, James was his name." Very good
reasons, of which the force has been admitted by some eminent
Christian theologians, have been given for regarding the words in
italics as an interpolation. It is, however, not absolutely impossible
that the phrase "the brother of Jesus " is genuine and the following
phrase a Christian gloss. It is likely that Josephus would have
given some intimation as to who this James was. He cannot have
done that by naming a Jesus whom he mentions nowhere else. But
in the same section he names a Jesus who was made High Priest in
the place of Ananus (Annas). 266



CONCLUSION 267
" Jews," and he says that " the most equitable " of the citizens were displeased, and that in consequence of their protests Ananus was deprived by King Agrippa of his high priesthood. We may learn also from 1 Cor. x, 1, that some at any rate of the Hellenistic Jewish Christians had not ceased to think
of themselves as Jews. The writer says " our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea." No hostility to the Jews is apparent in this section, and there is no attack upon the nation as a whole. The writer adduces
the faults committed by " some of them " as examples for the admonition of the Hellenistic Jews whom he is addressing. Severer censure of the Jewish people can be found in the Prophets, in the Psalms of Solomon, and in 2 Esdras. Who,
reading this section, would ever imagine that the Jews had filled the cup of their iniquity by killing the Christ ? There are cases where silence is equivalent to a negative, and this
is one of them. At the date when the section was written the Christian Jews were still hoping to convert their own people. The fall of Jerusalem, which appeared to be a punishment from God, and the tightening of the bands of Jewish orthodoxy, seriously damaged this hope without at first destroying it. Its fulfilment was thrown forward to a more
distant future. But there was still for a time no bitterness and no denunciation of Jews on the Christian side. This
can be clearly seen, in Rom. ix-xi, written by the editor who wrote the section referred to above, shortly after the fall of Jerusalem.1 Even now he writes as a Jew who has not entirely separated himself from his own people. And not once in the three chapters does he reproach the Jews with having crucified Jesus. He is not angry; he is grieved that
his " kinsmen according to the flesh " have refused God's
offer of salvation in Christ. " For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to everyone that believeth." The Jews had declined to believe; and that is the worst this writer can say of them. But the predominant Pharisaic party would no longer tolerate nonconformity, and so, how
1 The whole Epistle, including of course chapters ix-xi, was much
interpolated in the second century by the writer of chapters iii-v.



268 CONCLUSION
ever reluctantly, the Jewish. Christians were compelled to cut themselves off from their own people. The community whose leader was James was Ebionite.
The Nazarenes were either very closely connected with it or a subdivision of it.1 There is no good reason for supposing that before the fall of Jerusalem the Gnostic Christian sects of Greece and Asia Minor had any intercourse with it. After that event, when Jewry became strictly Pharisaic and ex clusive, and nonconformity of every kind was repressed, the sects which had sufficient in common to make an alliance possible were driven towards one another by the general persecution. And very soon a few far-sighted men among the nonconformist Jews conceived the magnificent project of welding these nonconformists into a new religious body capable of occupying the position vacated by the Jews and of carrying on an effective warfare against polytheism. We saw in the Odes of Solomon the germ of the belief that the
community of Saints was the new " chosen people " ; and now they had to take up more earnestly than before God's commission to enlighten the Gentiles. The purpose was one strong enough to bring about union between monotheistic congregations whose doctrine and practice might otherwise have been sufficiently different to keep them apart. The Gnostic Christian communities in general were not too widely separated from one another in the matter of doctrine for a loose federation to be difficult of attainment ; but not all of them were of the anti-Judaic character which dis tinguished the community O and the Pauline Christians;
hence it is quite intelligible that the early Christian literature from about the year 80 into the second century gives evidence of disputes concerning the observance of the Mosaic Law which threw dogmatic differences into the background.
It is evident that for some considerable time there were Jews in the Christian churches who continued to observe the Sabbath and Jewish regulations with regard to unclean food; but it is not likely that strong insistence upon the necessity for circumcision was maintained by Jewish
1 R. Handmann, Texte und Untersuchungen, Bd. V, Heft 3, pp. 104 ff.



CONCLUSION 269
Gnostics. We may infer the attitude of the Gnostic Ebionites from the information given in the Clementine Recognitions that Peter had no objection to eating with uncircumcized people providing that they had beeh baptized. The comparative latitude of Peter is also inferable from the Epistle to the Galatians. The subsequent backsliding with
which he is there reproached may be doubted. If, as is
stated, he had been in the habit of living "as do the Gen
tiles," the other leaders must have known of it, so that there could have been no reason for his being intimidated on this
occasion. And if it were true that his conduct then had been an exception to his customary rule, it could not be true that
he " compelled the Gentiles to live as do the Jews." The writer cannot have been recording a conference in which
he himself had taken part. His account lacks " actuality." The representation appears to be an artifice to throw into relief the independence of Paul and thereby to impress the people addressed with a sense of their own weakness in allowing themselves to be led astray by the Judaizers.1
It is not likely that the Gnostic Ebionites had rejected
Paul as an apostate from the Law; that statement must
have been made with respect to the Judaic Ebionites. It was thought at one time that Paul is attacked in the Clementines in the figure of Simon Magus. That seems doubtful, though
he is certainly attacked in one section of the Homilies, which is probably an interpolation. There is, one may conclude,
some historical truth in the passages of Acts x, 9-29 and xv, 6-11, in which Peter is represented as an advocate of toleration and even as having been sent to the Gentiles; and there is good ground for the opinion that he was not so close an associate of James as in other places he is made out to be.
In the time of Philo the Essenes and Therapeuts were important sects, but these sects appear to have completely
disappeared in the second century. We may infer that they were absorbed into the expanding Christian confederation ;
1 The controversy had not begun in the lifetime of Paul. In the
oldest sections of Romans and Corinthians there is no indication of
Christian differences concerning the observance of the Law.



27,0 CONCLUSION
also that their doctrine must have been of a Gnostic type and sufficiently nearly related to that of other Gnostic Christians. The absorption of the Essenes would account for the presence of so much Essene doctrine in the Gospels as to have led some
writers to the conclusion that Jesus was an Essene. It is very doubtful indeed whether community of property was a custom of the early Christian churches as a whole, but the statement in Acts iv, 32, may apply to some of them ; and,
if so, Essenes appear to be indicated.1 Other Gnostic Christian communities were not completely absorbed, but many of their members must in course of time have been recruited. The appropriation of Peter by the Catholic Church implies the adherence of a large number of Gnostic Ebionites ; and there can be no doubt that the Mandaeans, who were at one time sufficiently numerous to be serious rivals to the infant community, gradually passed over to it
in considerable numbers. John the Baptist was a Mandaean Christ. Rivalry between the sects is deducible, not only from attacks upon Jesus in the Mandaean writings, but also from the account of a discussion in the Recognitions between the disciples of Jesus and one of John's disciples, in the course
of which the latter affirms that John, and not Jesus, was the Christ. This account is by no means accordant with the Christian representation of John as the forerunner and announcer of Jesus ; but the Christian representation may very well conceal the fact that Mandaeism did help to pre
pare the way for Christianity ; and the annexation of John
may have been a clever stroke of policy. In the Fourth
Gospel two of the disciples of Jesus—one of them being
Andrew—are said to have been disciples" of John, which we may takeHo mean Mandaeans, and in the Acts of the Apostles
conversion of disciples of John to Christianity is recorded. The men who were aiming at the substitution of a new organization on a wider basis and one more acceptable to Pagans for the old religious organization of the Jews must quickly have seen that, while freedom from the Mosaic
1 Guignebert (work cited, p. 190) wrote : " It is not improbable
that the Essene movement finally merged with and was absorbed
into Christianity."



CONCLUSION 271
Law was a condition indispensable for success, the Old Testament, the identification of Jesus with the Jewish Messiah, and the prestige of Jerusalem would be very
valuable assets. But the intense Judaism of the Ebionite church must have made its inclusion in the confederation difficult. There were evidently negotiations and a comprom ise. The accounts given in Galatians and Acts of the Council
of Jerusalem are mutually contradictory and unreliable. The agreement said in Galatians to have been reached would
not have been practicable. If we believe the Acts of the Apostles, Paul went straight away and violated it. The actual agreement probably was that circumcision should not be insisted upon as a condition for admission into the Hellenist Christian communities. On the other hand, it is certain that the leaders even of those communities had not
power to forbid it. For in Gal. v—a chapter which is not
part of the original Epistle—the writer has to make an impassioned appeal to his readers not to allow themselves to be misled by Judaizers who were endeavouring to persuade
them of its necessity. A considerable section of the Ebionites, refusing to ally themselves with churches in which Judaic observances were not insisted upon, retained their inde pendence and, like the more uncompromising of the Gnostics, became heretics by standing still.
2. Catholicization
The men who were endeavouring to weld the hetero geneous communities into a great Church must have been well endowed with tact and practical wisdom. The saying
falsely ascribed to Paul —." I am become all things to all
men, that I may by all means save some "—is in somewhat
exaggerated terms the motto of the Catholic leaders. To gather in Jews, Hellenists, and Pagans the entrance had at first to be rather wide ; and no rigid standard of orthodoxy can have been set up. The means employed to obtain union were, firstly, appeals to the members to compose their
differences and to give heed to the instruction of their presbyters, and, secondly, insidious propaganda through



272 CONCLUSION ,
the circulation of falsified documents, coupled with assu >trances that Paul, Peter, and Apollos had all taught the same 1'fargest common measure of Catholic doctrine upon whiclah the
leaders in their wisdom had agreed.1 The authority oft Paul was so valuable in the struggle against Judaic encroac 'Went and for securing the adhesion of the Pauline communities that he was given high rank as an Apostle ; but his opinions were misrepresented and his Epistles were Catholicized. During the second century the Catholicizing parties in the churches became strong enough to expel those Gnostics
who had declined to abandon the primitive Pauline, Johannine, or other Gnostic Christology. The Catholicizers of course maintained that theirs was the pure original doc trine and they were always able by fabricated or adulterated documents to establish the validity of their claim. So those who had refused to retreat from an earlier position became
" antichrists," and as it is written in 1 Jn.

:

;

the body, as we learn from
1
Cor. xv, 12-54. And since the writer
is
compelled to reason with such people, we may infer that the leaders either had not the power to expel them as heretics or did not consider
it
expedient to do so. But during the second century unification steadily proceeded, the authority of the bishops was strengthened, and a centre
of church government established in Rome. That, however, did not mean that uniformity was secured. Within certain well-defined limits the Roman Catholic Church has always

CONCLUSION 273
allowed to individual members a good deal of freedom of opinion, and a modified form of Gnostic Christology persisted.
Clement of Alexandria and Origen were exponents of it; and the estimation in which by some, even in the Middle Ages, the Hermetic writings were held is a proof that it was then still alive. Cosimo Medici had the Greek text brought from Bulgaria for his library. And somewhat later the poet
Ludovici Lazareli, on being reproved by the King of Naples
for admiring this literature, replied : "I am a Christian,
O King, and am not ashamed of being at the same time an
Hermetic. For if you consider his precepts you will obtain assurance that they are not far removed from Christian doctrine." 1 Gnostic theosophy could not have tinged Chris
tianity so deeply as it did if it had originated outside and been regarded from the beginning as an alien growth. The assertion of some writers that the disputers of the historicity of Jesus ignore the personal factor is not true. The reply might be made that theologians in order to aggrandize Jesus belittle the prominent men of the period,
except perhaps Paul. As for the disciples, they, it is supposed, were men incapable of understanding their teacher, until his death, in some inexplicable manner, penetrated their minds with a brilliant illumination. Modern disbelief in the reality of the Resurrection and proof that the post-mortem appearances of Jesus are rather late inventions have made unintelligible the traditional account of the origin of Chris
tianity. In passing it may be observed that the sudden transformation of the stolid and impercipient disciples into the enhghtened and capable leaders of the primitive Church has never been made psychologically comprehensible. Since even some eminent theologians have seen the unsubstanti
ally of the assertion that the figure of Jesus is " uninvent
ible," it is not necessary to consider it seriously. But certainly the men who imagined and drew the Gospel
portraits—there are more than one —were very far indeed
from being ignorant and unintelligent men; it is to the remarkable quality of their work that belief in the historicity of Jesus is due.

274 CONCLUSION
3. What is the Essence of Christianity ?
A slogan at one time much in favour with liberal
Christians was " Back to Jesus," as though an uncorrupted
Christianity would be thereby recovered. But the existence of the Jesus to whom they wished to return is by other
theologians flatly denied. If we ask of theological critics
" What was Jesus like ?" their discordant replies leave the
impression that if he existed he is completely unknown. Schweitzer, after reviewing the history of the search for
him, thus sums up the result :
The Jesus of Nazareth, who came forth as Messiah, an
nounced the morality of the Kingdom of God, founded the
Kingdom of Heaven upon earth, and died to consecrate his
work, has never existed. He is a figure designed by rational
ism, endowed with life by liberalism, and clothed by modern
theology in an historical garment.1
If it were possible to get back to the earliest years of the
first century, what would be recovered would be a Gnostic Christianity which adored a heavenly Christ, but had no knowledge of a human Jesus. Christians might perhaps do worse than return to a modernized form of it.
If you value highly the Christian ethic, what does it
matter whether it was enunciated by a single prophet
named Jesus, or whether it was carefully polished by several
Christian prophets who sifted it out from the most admired moral doctrine of their day ? The essential rule of Christian
conduct will, I suppose, in the opinion of Christians, be the
injunction : " Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
It is, however, to be found in the Old Testament (Lev. xix,
34; Deut. x, 19); and, more broadly expressed, in the
Wisdom of Solomon (xii, 19) : " Thou didst teach thy people
that the righteous must be a lover of men." This universal principle of love covers the parable of the Good Samaritan.2 Again, is there anything in the New Testament more
" Christian " than the verse of Proverbs (xxv, 21) : " If
thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat ; and if he
thirsty give him water to drink " ? The fact is that the

CONCLUSION 275
\
best features of the Christian ethic are just those which it has in common with the best Jewish and Stoic morality. , The precepts which are peculiarly distinctive of the teaching of Jesus are so impracticable that Christians themselves make no pretence of practising them.
If you value the Gospel Jesus as the finest example of the
human character, he can still supply an incentive to endeavour even though the portrait presented be actually an ideal and
a symbol. I, for my part, have met with a few characters in fiction which have been more effective in making me feel
dissatisfied with myself. For here again fact and theory
do not coincide. It is not the Jesus figure of the Gospels,
particularly not of the second, which is loved and taken for a model. He is too detached from all human relationships and too far exalted above every human weakness, for that.
He is not especially lovable; he is at times —judged as a
man —harsh or arrogant ; his disciples stand in awe of him ; and in the Synoptics the only person he is ever said to have loved is a man whom he had never previously seen. Surely that should strike a thoughtful reader as strange. The man is a type of the Jewish nation, and Jesus is said to have
" loved " him because in Hos.

1,
it
is
written
:
" When Israel was young

loved him." The good that Jesus does
is
done by supernatural power, so that no opportunity for the exercise of the admirable human quality of self-sacrifice, or even of the sympathy which
is
exhibited in simple human acts,
is
afforded. The compassion of Jesus
is
the compassion of God; his indignation
is
tainted by the partisanship of the men who made him the spokesman of their own feelings. His invective against the Pharisees

unjust. Conduct and speech which are not amiable cause no offence because they are not judged by human standards. The Jesus who
is
loved
is
an ideal which Christians make for themselves, chiefly by concentrating their attention upon
a
very few episodes and allowing imagination to play freely upon them. The ideal has its foundation presumably in the impression produced by the Fourth Gospel, though even there Jesus
is
both too much a god and too much a partisan to serve as a practical example for men.



276 CONCLUSION
If you believe in a divine Christ, so did the Gnostics who
denied his individual and corporeal reality. The Gnostic dualism does not commend itself to modern philosophical thinkers ; but the Catholic materialization of the Christ is surely not of vital importance to Christianity, unless from the point of view of popular success. W. B. Smith, Drews, and van den Bergh van Eysinga have in fact protested against
it in the interest of a spiritual religion. Are we to suppose that nearly all Christians are so far Materialists at heart as to
feel that if they were to lose the material Jesus nothing would be left ? Christians, however, who might be able to rise above the popular standpoint would be faced with the ancient problem of which esoterism was the solution. Every one who has unfeignedly longed to know and to follow
" the best " must have learnt that " the popular " is never
" the best." In a recently published anthology entitled The
Wisdom of Life the following utterance of P. H. D. d'Holbach
is quoted :
Nature tells man to seek light, to search for the truth;
religion enjoins upon him to examine nothing, to remain in
ignorance. Nature says to man : " Cherish glory, labour
to win esteem, be active, courageous, industrious " ; religion
says to him : " Be humble, abject, pusillanimous, live in
retreat, busy thyself in prayer, meditation, devout rites."
The opinion expressed is somewhat too sweeping. There are many forms of religion; and in these days the word is
sometimes used so loosely as to deprive it of its distinctive significance. But even in religion properly so called there are gradations of quality which set the highest very far indeed above the lowest. The early Gnosticism had some
obvious defects; but it was not by intrinsic merit that Catholic Christianity prevailed. Its victory may have been
a survival of the fit in relation to the environment ; but it was not a survival of the best.



APPENDIX A
THE GOSPEL OF PETER
The date generally accepted for the composition of the Gospel of Peter is 140 c.e. ; but in fixing this date account
was not taken of the probability that the Gospel of which
we possess a fragment had been added to; and judging by analogy the probability is great. Critics of the New Testament are aware of the fact that behind both Matthew
and Mark there lies a simpler, shorter Gospel. It happens
that of another early apocryphal Gospel —the Protevangelium
of James—several copies have survived, and the wide differences which exist between the extant MSS. show that even the most ancient does not present it in its original
form. It is thought possible that this Gospel was composed in the first century, but the existing versions are a good deal later than that. We know that there were in the second century versions of the Gospel according to the Hebrews which differed from one another; and these no doubt had
come into existence through amplification of a shorter
original. A Gospel once written steadily grew with successive editions, and behind them all lies a primitive Gospel which
is irrecoverable. It is therefore highly probable that the surviving version of the Gospel of Peter is an amplified and
interpolated version of a simpler original which, as we may in fact conclude from internal evidence, was composed
at a date considerably earlier. It is by no means improbable that this Gospel has preserved features of the primitive, one which the canonical Gospels have lost. They superseded
it because they were more congenial to Catholic Christians of the second century. The fact that it has Gnostic features is not at all inconsistent with a very early date. Quite the
contrary. Harnack wrote : " It is beyond doubt that theologic literature had its origin among the Gnostics." 1
1 Dogmengeschichte, Vol. I, p. 230, n 1. 277



278 APPENDIX A
The earliest information we possess concerning a collection of letters ascribed to Paul comes through the Gnostic Marcion; and the earliest known commentaries on the Gospels are by Gnostics. There is plenty of justification for the supposition that the Primitive Gospel was Gnostic and I that our synoptic Gospels are much amplified and CatholicJ ized versions of it. Mark, however, as commentators have perceived, has retained to some degree the Gnostic
atmosphere. The final decision with regard to the Gospel of Peter must
depend upon a critical examination of it. Such an examina tion reveals the fact that a portion of the fragment (§§ 7-10)
differs in character from the rest. One of the sections (9)
contains supernatural details of the kind which are found in the later apocryphal Gospels. The narrative is more circum stantial than the synoptic ; the name of the centurion who commanded the guard at the sepulchre is given; we are told that seven seals were spread upon the door of the sepulchre and given other information not found in Mark. These sections must be judged to be younger than the corresponding portion of the synoptic narrative. With regard to the remainder of the fragment the case is on the whole quite different. We have a simpler and apparently an earlier story. Between Mk. xv, 21 and 41, there are approximately 400 words ; the corresponding passage in the Gospel of Peter has about 250 words and is as
deficient in detail as the sections above referred to are re dundant. This portion of the narrative, although it appears to have been slightly expanded from a still simpler original, produces an impression of great antiquity. There is no mention of Simon of Cyrene, no naming of Golgotha, no
description of the jeers of passers by, and no mention of
the centurion or of the " women beholding from afar." Passing then through the §§7-10, we find again in §11 the
characteristic style of the earlier document. There is indeed evidence that this section also has been somewhat expanded ; but the expansion is in the nature of an elaboration of older material without the addition of details from Mark or any other known source. The corresponding portion of Mark is



THE GOSPEL OF PETER 279
xvi, 1-8, which begins by naming the women who accompanied
Mary Magdalene to the sepulchre. In the Gospel of Peter
the names are not given ; we have simply " Mary Magdalene . . . took with her her female friends." Verse 7 is entirely wanting and verse 8, which contains 28 words, is repre
sented by the very concise statement, " Then the women fled affrighted."
It is worth noting that, whereas in §§7-10 Scribes and
Pharisees, elders and priests, are mentioned, in the other
sections we read only of " the Jews." It is, moreover, extremely significant that only in §§ 7-10 does Pilate play
any important part ; nor is there mention elsewhere of his soldiers. Outside of these sections Pilate is named in two
contexts only—viz., in § 2, which, as was shown in Chapter VI,
is in all probability an interpolation —and in the incredible statement that he sat with Herod at the trial. Throughout
§§ 3-6 Jews are the actors ; it is they who set up the cross ;
it is they who place on the cross the superscription, " This
is the King of Israel," it is they who take the body down and
deliver it to Joseph. Everything is done by the authority of
Herod; but in § 8 we learn that the " elders " have to go
to Pilate with the request that he would supply soldiers to guard the tomb. The two portions of the narrative do not cohere. There is nothing in Mark or Luke about the request
of the elders ; but the account in the Gospel of Peter is an
amplification of that in Matthew, and is obviously of later
date. It seems impossible that the writer who in §§ 7-10
has furnished an abundance of detail not to be found in the synoptic Gospels should elsewhere have ignored so many of the details which are included in the corresponding portions of Mark and have been satisfied to present us with so meagre an account. By any sound rule of literary criticism we ought to decide that §§ 7-10 have been inserted
into a much older narrative — a narrative whose author was unacquainted with any of our four Gospels.
In connection with the request of the elders for a guard there is an interesting point which seems to prove that the
section is a comparatively late insertion. In Mk. xv, 39,
we read of a centurion who stood near the cross and, " when



280 APPENDIX A
he saw that he so gave up the ghost," said : " Truly this
man was the Son of God." The interpolator, finding no
mention of this centurion in the original Gospel of Peter, and
being determined not to omit his exclamation, has put it into the mouth of the centurion who commanded the guards at the tomb. The begging of the body of Jesus by Joseph seems to have been included in the original Gospel. His request, however, must have been made not to Pilate but to the Jews who had taken Jesus down from the cross. The latter circumstance is related in § 6, which is clearly the proper place for the request.
In the existing text § 2, which follows the command of
Herod that the Lord should be taken, begins thus : " Now
there stood there Joseph the friend of Pilate and the Lord."
The words " the friend of Pilate " seem to have been intro duced for the purpose of explaining why the petition was
addressed to Pilate instead of to Herod, the actual judge
and person in authority. If, as appears probable, the
section is an interpolation, the words, " Now there stood there Joseph," may have been transferred from thenproper place in § 6, where they fit perfectly. The Jews are
distressed because the darkness has made them think that the sun has set and the body has not been buried as by their
law it should have been. Then in § 6, inserting the phrase
referred to, we should read : " Then the sun shone out, and it was found to be the ninth hour. Now there stood there Joseph the friend of the Lord, and he begged the body of the Lord for burial. And the Jews rejoiced and they gave
his body to Joseph to bury it." It was pointed out previously that the citation of the law which appropriately occurs in this connection has been duplicated in the interpolated § 2
in Herod's reply to the petition of Pilate. We may note
that in this Gospel Joseph is not named " of Arimathea," and in other respects the section is less detailed than the account in Mark, as may be seen by comparing xv, 42-47, with the comparatively bald statement in the Gospel of
Peter, " So he took the Lord and washed him and wrapped him in linen and brought him into his own tomb, called Joseph's Garden."



THE GOSPEL OF PETER 281
Several scholars, including Sir James Frazer, Salomon
Reinach, and W. Bousset, have seen that, if Jesus had been condemned on the charge of having claimed to be the king
of the Jews, the Roman governor who sentenced him could
not conceivably have ordered the inscription " This is the
King of the Jews " to be placed upon the cross. This item
is quite incompatible with the rest of the narrative. In the Oospel of Peter, however, where the scene of the mocking
is enacted by the people and may be understood as the representation of an ancient sacrificial rite, the item falls naturally into its place. We are told in this Gospel that the
people set Jesus on a seat of judgment, saying, " Judge righteously, O King of Israel." Then the inscription,
*' This is the King of Israel " over the head of the crucified victim is just a continuation of the mockery. This item seems to be a crucial test which supplies the final proof that the account in the Gospel of Peter is substantially primitive.
It is an interesting fact that Justin found in his Memoirs
the statement that " they tormented him and set him on a judgment seat and said : Judge us." The substitution of
" Judge us " for " Judge righteously, 0 King of Israel "
renders it uncertain whether Justin derived his statement from the Gospel of Peter. As there is reason to believe that
he was acquainted with that Gospel, he may have had an earlier form of it, since even the oldest sections of the text that we possess have been somewhat expanded. Or Justin
may have abridged the statement he found. If, however, he
did not take it from the Gospel of Peter, evidently it was also
contained in some other early apocryphal Gospel. Pilate had been introduced into the narrative before the time of Justin's writing, and the item in question cannot have been
inserted after the introduction of Pilate ; it must belong to a very early form of the narrative indeed. According to Mark the mocking by the soldiers of Pilate took place in an
open court where there would be no seat of any kind. It is true that the Greek word used does not necessarily mean a seat; but the context seems to require this meaning, and
it is more likely that the canonical Gospels omitted the item
because of its incongruity with the supposed situation than
t— o.o.



282 APPENDIX A
that it was introduced into some Gospel at a later date. It
is not found in the later Gospel of Nicodemus.
The application of the title " the Lord " to Jesus in a
Gnostic Gospel is not inconsistent with an early date. The title occurs in sections of the Pauline Epistles which wereundoubtedly written in the first century.
Note
Since writing the above I have had, through the kindness
of Dr. van den Bergh van Eysinga, the advantage of reading
some articles contributed by van Manen to the Theologisch
Tijdschrift, 1893. In the Gospel of Peter, immediately after
Jesus had uttered his only cry, it is said that " he was taken
up." Since the body of Jesus still hung upon the cross, this
must mean that his spirit, his power, the Spirit of God that
had been within him, was taken up. Van Manen's comment
is : "In this conception there is no room for a resurrection
from the dead after the deceased had tarried for a while in
the realm of shades ; whence it would follow that ' he was
taken up ' originally belonged to a form of the Gospel in
which nothing was yet related concerning the resurrection
and ascension of Jesus." The conception, as readers will
perceive, is Gnostic. Van Manen was convinced of the great
antiquity of portions of the fragment ; among other evidence
he mentions the term " King of Israel," which, as he says,
is an older form than the canonical " King of the Jews."



APPENDIX B
THE GNOSTIC NUCLEUS OF THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS
Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, separated unto the gospel of God, to all who are beloved of God.
I am not ashamed of the gospel ; for it is the power of God
unto salvation to everyone that believeth, both to Jew and to Greek. For wrath from heaven is revealed against all impiety and unrighteousness of men who keep down the truth. Because, knowing God, they glorified him not as God, but became vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things. Wherefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonoured among themselves ; for their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature; and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men working unseemliness and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due. But we, who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein ? Or are ye ignorant that all who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ? We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death ; that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
Father, so we also might walk in newness of life. For if wo have become united with the similitude of his death, we shall be also with the similitude of his resurrection ; knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof; neither present
t2—o.c. 283



284 APPENDIX B
your members unto sin as instruments of unrighteousness ;
but present yourselves unto God as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.
Know ye not that to whom ye present yourselves as servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey ; whether
of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness ? But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered ; and being set free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness. What fruit then had ye
at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed ? For
the end of those things is death. But now being made free
from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life. There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. For they that are after the flesh do mind the things
of the flesh ; but they that are after the spirit the things of
the spirit. But ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh to live
after the flesh ; for if ye live after the flesh ye must die ; but
if by the spirit ye mortify the body ye shall five. For as
many as are led by the spirit of God, these are the sons of
God. For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear ; but ye received the spirit of sonship whereby we cry Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our
spirit that we are children of God ; and if children, then heirs,
heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ ; if so be that we
suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him. For
I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy
to be compared with the glory which is in the future to be
revealed to us. For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God. For the crea tion was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but through him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself shall also be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the
liberty of the glory of the children of God. For we know that
the whole creation groaneth and travaileth together until



EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS 285
now. And not only so, but we ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan within ourselves, waiting for the
sonship, the deliverance from our body. For by hope we were saved; but hope that is seen is not hope; for who
hopeth for that which he seeth ? But if we hope for that which we see not, with patience we wait for it. And we know that to those who love God all things work together for
good. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to
come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God. Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.



APPENDIX C
THE GNOSTIC NUCLEUS OF THE FIRST EPISTLE
TO THE CORINTHIANS1
Paul, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, sanctified in Christ Jesus.
I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of
God which was given you in Christ Jesus, that in all ye were
enriched in him, in every word and all knowledge. For the word of the cross is to them that are perishing foolishness,
but unto us who are being saved it is the power of God. For since, in the wisdom of God, the world knew not God through wisdom, it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness
of the preaching to save those who believe. Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumbling-block, and unto Gentiles foolishness, but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of
God. For behold your calling, brethren, how that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called ; but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame them that are wise ; and God chose the .weak things of the world that he might put to shame the things that are strong^nd the base things of the world and
the things that are despised did God choose, the things that are not, that he might bring to nought the things that
are. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and
redemption.
And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the
1 Of all the writings published in Paul's name this is the most
likely to be a Letter really written by him. 286



FIRST EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS 287
mystery of God, that your faith should not stand in the
wisdom of men, but in the power of God. Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect ; yet a wisdom not of this aeon, nor of the archons of this aeon, which are coming to nought ; but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that hath been hidden, which God fore-ordained before the 330ns unto our glory, which none of the archons of this aeon knew ;
for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But unto us God revealed it through the Spirit ; for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of
God. For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man which is in him ? Even so the things of God none knoweth save the Spirit of God. But we received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God ; which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. Now the psychic
man receiveth not the things of the Spirit [Pneuma] of God,
for they are foolishness unto him, and he cannot know them,
because they are spiritually judged. But he that is pneu matic judgeth all things and he himself is judged by no man. Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are diversities of ministrations and the same Lord. And there are diversities of inward workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all. But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for that which may be profitable. For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom ; and to another the word of gnosis, according to the same Spirit ; to another faith, in the same Spirit ; and to another inward workings of powers; and to another prophecy ; and to another discernings of spirits ; to another divers kinds of tongues ; but one and the same Spirit worketh
all these, dividing to each one severally even as he will. For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the
Christ. For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free, and were all



288 APPENDIX C
made to drink of one Spirit. For the body is not one
member but many. If the foot shall say, Because I am not
the hand, I am not of the body, it is not therefore not of the
body. And if the ear shalr say, Because I am not the eye, I
am not of the body ; it is not therefore not of the body. If
the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing ? If the
whole were hearing, where were the smelling ? But now
hath God set the members each one of them in the body as it
pleased him. And if they were all one member, where were
the body ? But now there are many members, but one bodjr.
And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee ;
or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary ; and those parts of the body which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness, whereas our comely parts have no
need. But God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honour to that part which lacked; that there should be no schism in the body, but that the members
should have the same care one for another. And if
one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it;
or if one member is honoured, all the members rejoice with it. Desire earnestly spiritual, gifts, but rather that ye may
prophesy. For he that speaketh in a tongue, speaketh not
to men, but unto God ; for no man understandeth, but in the spirit he speaketh mysteries. But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification and comfort and consolation. Even things without life giving a voice, whether pipe or harp,
if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be
known what is piped or harped ? For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who will prepare himself for war ? So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to be under
stood, how shall it be known what is spoken ? For ye will be
speaking into the air. If therefore the whole church be assembled together and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that
ye are mad ? But if all prophesy, and there come in one



FIRST EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS 289
unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all ; the secrets of his heart are made manifest ; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed. My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.



APPENDIX D
THE GNOSTIC NUCLEUS OF THE SECOND EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS
Paul, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth. Now he that establisheth us with you into Christ, and anointed us is God ; who also sealed us and gave us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts and read by all men, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tables of stone but in tables that are hearts of flesh. And this great confidence that we have through the Christ is in God, who made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the spirit ; for the letter killeth, but the spirit maketh alive. Therefore seeing we have this ministry even as we obtained mercy we faint not ; but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor presenting a counterfeit of the Logos of God ; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every
man's consciousness in the sight of God. But if our gospel is yet veiled, it is veiled to them that are perishing, among whom the god of this aeon hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn upon
them. Seeing that it is God who shined in our hearts to give the illumination of the gnosis of his glory.
But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves. We are pressed on every side, yet not straitened; perplexed, yet not unto despair; pursued, yet
not forsaken; smitten down, yet not destroyed. But though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is
renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is for the moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things
290



SECOND EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS 291
which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal ; but the things which
are not seen are eternal. For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven; at least
if,
being
clothed, we shall not be found naked. For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened
;
not that we wish to be unclothed, but to be clothed upon, so that what
is
mortal may be swallowed up by life. Now he that created us for this very thing
is
God who gave us the earnest of the Spirit. Wherefore
if
any man
is
in Christ he
is
a new creature
;
the old things are passed away
;
behold they are become new. But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave unto us the service of reconciliation
;
in that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation. We therefore, as though God were entreating by us, are ambassadors on behalf of Christ, giving no occasion of stumbling in anything that our service be not blamed
;
but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings
;
in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned, in the word of truth, in the power of God
;
by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by glory and dishonour, by evil report and good report
;
as- deceivers and yet true
;
as unknown and yet well-known
;
as dying and behold we live
;
as chastened and not killed
;
as sorrowful, yet always rejoic ing
;
as poor, yet making many rich
;
as having nothing, yet possessing all things. Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfected
;
be comforted
;
be of the same mind
;
live in peace
;
and the God of love and peace will be with you.



APPENDIX E
THE ORIGINAL EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS
(Probable Date ca. 80 c.e.)
Paul, an apostle, unto the churches of Galatia.
I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that
called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel. As
we have said before, so say I now again, If any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let
him be anathema. For I make known to you, brethren, as
touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not
according to man. For neither did I receive it from man, nor
was I taught it ; but when it was the good pleasure of him who set me apart even from my mother's womb to reveal his
Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles,
immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood, nor did I
go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but
I went away into Arabia ; and again I returned to Damascus.
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit
Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days. But other of the
apostles saw I none, save James the Brother of the Lord.
Now touching the things which I write to you, behold, before
God I lie not. Then I came into the regions of Syria and
Cilicia. And I was still unknown by face unto the churches
of Judaea which were in Christ. Then after the space of
fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas.
[And I went up by revelation ;] and I laid before them the
gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, and that because
of the false brethren privily brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that
they might bring us into bondage ; to whom we gave place in
the way of subjection, no, not for an hour ; that the truth of
the gospel might continue with you. But from those who
were reputed to be somewhat (whatsoever they were, it
292



ORIGINAL EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS 293
makes no matter to me ; God accepts no man's person)
they, I say, who were of repute imparted nothing to me ; but
contrariwise, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and
John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of friendship, that we should go unto the Gentiles and they unto the circumcision ; only they
would that we should remember the poor ; which very thing I was also zealous to do.
But when Cephas came to Antioch I withstood him to the
face because he was condemned. For before certain men came from James he ate with the Gentiles ; but when they came he drew back, fearing them that were of the circum cision. And the rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him ; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with
their dissimulation. But when I saw that they walked not
uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel, I said to
Cephas before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest in the
manner of the Gentiles and not in that of the Jews, how compellest thou the Gentiles to follow the customs of the Jews ? We, being Jews by nature, yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, believed on Christ
Jesus. But if I build up again those things which I
destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor. For I through the
law died unto the law, that I might live unto God. I have
been crucified with Christ ; yet I live ; and yet no longer I
but Christ liveth in me ; and that life which I now live in the
flesh I live in faith, the faith which is in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself up for me.
But before faith came we were kept in ward under the law, shut up for the revealing of the faith which was to come. So that the law became our tutor to bring us to Christ. For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.
But I say that so long as the heir is a child he is different in nothing from a bondservant, though he is lord of all ; but is under guardians and stewards until the appointed time of the father. So we also, when we were children, were held in



294 APPENDIX E
bondage under the elements of the cosmos. But when the fulness of time came God sent forth his Son that we might receive the sonship. Howbeit at that time, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to them which by nature are no gods ; but now that ye have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over
again ? Ye observe days and months and seasons and years.
I am afraid of you lest by any means I have bestowed labour upon you in vain.
I beseech you, brethren, be as I am, for I am as ye are. Ye
did me no wrong ; but ye know that with an infirmity of the
flesh I preached the gospel to you th9 first time. And that
which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of God, even as
Christ Jesus. Where then is that blessedness of yours? For
I bear you witness that, if possible, ye would have plucked
out your eyes and given them to me. So then am I become
your enemy because I tell you the truth, my little children, of
whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you ?
But I could wish to be present with you now and to change
my voice, for I am perplexed about you.
With freedom did Christ set us free ; stand fast therefore and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.



APPENDIX F
PROLOGUE TO THE FOURTH GOSPEL
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him and without him was not anything made at all. That which became in him was life ; and the life was the light of men. And the light
shineth in the darkness, and the darkness mastered it not. The true light, which lighteth every man, was coming into the world, and the world was made through him and the world knew him not. He came unto his own things, and they that were his own received him not. But as many as received him to them gave he the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And he tabernacled among us,1 and we beheld his glory, glory as of an only-begotten [monogenes 2]
from the Father, full of grace and truth. And of his fulness we all received. No man hath seen God at any time ; the only -begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. For God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but
have eternal life. For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him. He that believeth on him is not judged; he that believeth not hath been judged already. And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the light ; for their works were
1 Cp. Ecclus. xxi, 8: " He that created me [Wisdom] made my
tabernacle to rest."
* Cp. Wis. vii, 13: "For there is in her a holy spirit alone in
kind [or sole-born, monogenes]." 295



296 APPENDIX F
evil. For everyone that doeth ill hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved.
But he that doeth the truth cometh to the truth, that his
works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God.
