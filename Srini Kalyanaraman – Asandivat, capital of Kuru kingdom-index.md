# Index for Srini Kalyanaraman – Asandivat, capital of Kuru kingdom.pdf

-- Archaeologists are looking at the wrong places for Mahabharata evidences; should dig the mound at Āsandīvat –a Painted Greyware site -- and re-evaluate chronology of Painted Greyware and Ochre-coloured Pottery archaeological sites to resolve the chronology of the Mahabharata war events along the Ancient Sarasvati River Basin
Āsandīvat, capital of Kuru kingdom; hastinā-pura,
capital of Pāṇḍavas; Indraprastha (इन्द्रप्रस्थ ) ‘palace
built for Pāṇḍavas’

Ancient tools: copper axes, thought to
belong to 2000 BCE, from Sakatpur,
Saharanpur Dist., UP; may relate to
Ochre Coloured Pottery (OCP) culture in
the doab (plains) of the two rivers in the
late Harappan period, around 2000 BC.



According to the Divyāvadāna the capital of Uttarā Pañcāla was Hastināpura, but the
Kumbhakāra Jātaka states that the capital of Uttarā Pañcāla was Kampillanagara and that
a king named Dummukha ruled there. But according to the Mahābhārata, Northern
Pañcāla had its capital at Ahicchatra or Chatravatī (identical with modern Ramnagar in
the Bareillay district) while southern Pañcāla had its capital at Kāmpilya, identical with
modern Kampil in the Farokhabad district, U.P. This apparent discrepancy in the two
evidences is reconciled when we take into account that ‘a great struggle raged in ancient
times between the Kurus and the Pañcālas for the possession of Uttarā Pañcāla.

Indraprastha (इन्द्रप्रस्थ ).—Palace of the Pāṇḍavas. It is the same as Delhi, the capital of modern
India. Construction. As ordained by Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Dharmaputra, claimant to half of the kingdom, went to the
forest Khāṇḍavaprastha with his brothers. Śrī Kṛṣṇa stood by them; great sages like Vyāsa helped them. There,
in the forest, they built a city called Indraprastha as beautiful as Indraloka. (Mahābhārata Sabhā Parva,
Chapter 211)...Kṛṣṇa asked Maya to build for the Pāṇḍavas a palace, the most beautiful one in the world at
Indraprastha. And, accordingly, after getting the Brahmins duly feasted, Maya marked the ground ten thousand
Kiṣkus* in extent. Then Maya went to the mountain Maināka to the west of Mount Kailāsa, where in the pool
called Bindu he had stored a large quantity of gold and gems. Maya brought those materials as also a conch
called Devadatta from there and built the most beautiful palace in the world at Indraprastha. Within the palace
were made many a beautiful pool and various patterns with galleries etc. in glass. It was built so beautifully
and in such a manner as to create, at the very sight, the illusion that there was water where there was really no
water and vice versa. It took fourteen months to complete the construction of that most beautiful model of
architecture. (Mahābhārata Sabhā Parva, Chapters 1-3). Vajra, son of Aniruddha of the Yādava dynasty was
made master of Indraprastha after the time of the Pāṇḍavas. (Mahābhārata Mausala Parva, Chapter 7, Verse
11). --Puranic Encyclopedia by Vettam Mani | 1975 | Story of Indraprastha

situated about fifty-seven miles north-east of the modern Delhi on the banks of an old channel of the
Ganges, and was the capital of the kings of the Lunar line, as Ayodhyā was of the Solar dynasty;
hence it forms a central scene of action in the Mahābhārata ; here Yudhi-ṣṭhira was crowned after a
triumphal progress through the streets of the city; See MBh. xii, 1386-1410 : other names for this
celebrated town are gajāhvaya, nāga-sāhvaya, nāgāhva, hāctina), MBh. ; Hariv. ; Pur. (Monier

Pāṇḍavas half of the kingdom, this part was given. Name of a country pertaining to the Pāñcālī
(Pāñcālamadhyamā). Yaugandharāyaṇa said to Udayana: “... for your ancestors also conquered the
regions by beginning with the East, and made their dwelling in Hastināpura on the banks of the
Ganges; but Śatānīka repaired to Kauśāmbī on account of its delightful situation, seeing that empire
depended upon valour, and situation had nothing to do with it”.(Kathāsaritsāgara, chapter 18.)
