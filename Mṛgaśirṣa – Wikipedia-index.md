The term Mṛgaśira (मृगिशर) a composite of two Sanskrit words, mṛga (मृग) meaning
animal/beast and śira (िशर) meaning head or precisely, the top of the head.
The names Mṛgaśira (मृगिशर) and Mārgaśīrṣa/Mṛgaśīrṣa (मागर्शीषर्) are sometimes used
interchangeably. Grammatically, Mārgaśīrṣa (मागर्शीषर्) means "of Mṛgaśira" or "related to
Mṛgaśira". Thus Mṛgaśira (मृगिशर) is the correct name of the star, while Mārgaśīrṣa
(मागर्शीषर्) is the name of the month related to Mṛgaśira, i.e., the month in which moon
will be in conjuncture with the Mṛgaśira nakṣatra. In Malayalam it is called
Makayeeram.
Under the traditional Hindu principle of naming individuals according to their
Ascendant/Lagna nakshatra, the following Sanskrit syllables correspond with this
nakṣatra, and would belong at the beginning of a first name:
Ve (Devanagari: वे)
Vo (Devanagari: वो)
Ka (Devanagari: क)
Ki (Devanagari: िक)
Mṛgaśira nakṣatra extends from after 23°20 in Vṛṣabha Rāśi up to 6°40 in Mithuna. Star
