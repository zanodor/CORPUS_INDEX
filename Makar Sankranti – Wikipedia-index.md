# Index for Makar Sankranti – Wikipedia.pdf

Makara Sankranti, Maghi, is a festival day in the Hindu calendar, in reference to deity Surya
(sun). It is observed each year in January.[3][4] It marks the first day of sun's transit into the
Makara (Capricorn), marking the end of the month with the winter solstice and the start of
longer days.[3][5]
Makara Sankranti [6] is one of the few
ancient Indian festivals that has been
observed according to solar cycles,
while most festivals are set by the lunar
cycle of the lunisolar Hindu calendar.[5]
Being a festival that celebrates the
solar cycle, it almost always falls on the
same Gregorian date every year
(January 14),[4] except in some years
when the date shifts by a day for that
year.[7] The festivities associated with
Makar Sankranti are known by various
names such as Maghi (preceded by
Lohri) by north Indian Hindus and
Sikhs, Makara Sankranti (Pedda
Pandaga) in Maharashtra, Goa, Andhra
Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka and
Telangana, Sukarat in central India,
Magh Bihu by Assamese, and Thai
Pongal by Tamils.[8][9]
Makara Sankranti is observed with
social festivities such as colorful
decorations, rural children going house
to house, singing and asking for treats
in some areas (or pocket money),[10]
melas (fairs), dances, kite flying,
bonfires and feasts.[9][11] The Magha Mela, according to Diana L. Eck (professor at Harvard
University specializing in Indology), is mentioned in the Hindu epic Mahabharata[12] Many go
to sacred rivers or lakes and bathe with thanksgiving to the sun.[12] Every twelve years, the
Hindus observe Makar Sankranti with one of the world's largest mass pilgrimages, with an
estimated 40 to 100 million people attending the event.[12][13][14] At this event, then they say a
prayer to the sun and bathe at the Prayaga confluence of the River Ganga and River Yamuna

Winter Solstice
Makara Sankranti is set by the solar cycle of the Hindu lunisolar calendar, and is observed
on a day which usually falls on 14 January of Gregorian calendar, but sometimes 15
January.[3][4][16] It signifies the arrival of longer days. Makar Sankranti falls in the Hindu
calendar solar month of Makara, and lunar month of Magha (the festival is also called Magha
Sankranti or Magha festival in parts of India).[17] It marks the end of the month with winter
solstice for India and the longest night of the year, a month that is called Pausha in lunar
calendar and Dhanu in the solar calendar in the Vikrami system. The festival celebrates the
first month with consistently longer days.[3]
There are two different systems to calculate the Makara Sankranti date: nirayana (without
adjusting for precession of equinoxes, sidereal) and sayana (with adjustment, tropical). The
January 14 date is based on the nirayana system, while the sayana system typically
computes to about December 23, per most Siddhanta texts for Hindu calendars.[18][19][20] As
per the solar calendar, after one year, Sun comes to the same location 20 min. late every
year which means Sun needs to 1 day extra after every 72 years in the sky. That's the reason
why Makar Sankranti is shifting from 14th Jan to 15th Jan and so on.
This festival is dedicated to the Hindu religious sun god, Surya.[4][21] This significance of
Surya is traceable to the Vedic texts, particularly the Gayatri Mantra, a sacred hymn of
Hinduism found in its scripture named the Rigveda. The festival also marks the beginning of
a six-month auspicious period for Hindus known as Uttarayana.[4]
Makara Sankranti is regarded as important for spiritual practices and accordingly, people
take a holy dip in rivers, especially Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri. The

bathing is believed to result in merit or absolution of past sins. They also pray to the sun and
thank for their successes and prosperity.[22] A shared cultural practices found amongst
Hindus of various parts of India is making sticky, bound sweets particularly from sesame (til)
and a sugar base such as jaggery (gud, gur). This type of sweet is a symbolism for being
together in peace and joyfulness, despite the uniqueness and differences between
individuals.[4] For most parts of India, this period is a part of early stages of the Rabi crop
and agricultural cycle, where crops have been sown and the hard work in the fields is mostly
over. The time thus signifies a period of socializing and families enjoying each other's
company, taking care of the cattle, and celebrating around bonfires, in Maharashtra the
festival is celebrated by flying kites.[4]
Makara Sankranti is an important pan-Indian solar festival, known by different names though
observed on the same date, sometimes for multiple dates around the Makar Sankranti. It is
known as Pedda Panduga in Andhra Pradesh, Makara Sankranti in Karnataka and
Maharashtra, Pongal in Tamil Nadu, Magh Bihu in Assam, Magha Mela in parts of central
and north India, as Makar Sankranti in the west, and by other names.In some parts of India it
is believed that a demon was killed in that day.[4]

Karnataka (ಕ"#ಟಕ)
Mysuru Decorated Cows. January 2017
This is the Suggi (!"#) or harvest festival for farmers of Karnataka. On this auspicious day,
girls wear new clothes to visit near and dear ones with a Sankranti offering in a plate and
exchange the same with other families. This ritual is called "Ellu Birodhu." Here the plate
would normally contain "Ellu" (white sesame seeds) mixed with fried groundnuts, neatly cut
dry coconut and fine cut bella (jaggery). The mixture is called "Ellu-Bella" (ಎ%& 'ಲ)). The
plate contains shaped sugar candy moulds (Sakkare Acchu, ಸಕ,- ಅ/0) with a piece of
sugarcane. There is a saying in Kannada "ellu bella thindu olle maathadi" that translates to
'eat the mixture of sesame seeds and jaggery and speak only good.' This festival signifies
the harvest of the season, since sugarcane is predominant in these parts. Ellu Bella, Ellu
Unde, bananas, sugarcane, red berries, haldi and kumkum and small gift items useful in
everyday lives are often exchanged among women in Karnataka.
Feast of Makar Sankranti
In some parts of Karnataka, a newly married woman is required to give away bananas for



five years to married women (muthaidhe/sumangali) from the first year of her marriage and
increase the number of bananas in multiples of five. There is also a tradition of some
households giving away red berries "Yalchi Kai" with the above. In north Karnataka, kite
flying with community members is a tradition. Drawing rangoli in groups is another popular
event among women during Sankranti.
An important ritual is display of cows and bulls in colourful costumes in an open field. Cows
are decorated for the occasion and taken on a procession. They are also made to cross a
fire. This ritual is common in rural Karnataka and is called "Kichchu Haayisuvudu."

The second day is Makara Sankranti. People wear new clothes, pray to God, and make
offerings of traditional food to ancestors who have died. They also make beautiful and ornate
drawings and patterns on the ground with chalk or flour, called "Rangoli" or "muggu" in
Telugu, in front of their homes. These drawings are decorated with flowers, colours and
small, hand-pressed piles of cow dung, called "gobbemma" (234!5).

Kanuma ($$+ +# #)
On the third day, Kanuma ("1!) is celebrated. Kanuma is very intimate to the hearts of
farmers because it is the day for praying and showcasing their cattle with honor. Cattle are
the symbolic indication of prosperity. On the day after Makara Sankranti, the animal kingdom
is remembered and, in particular, cows. Girls feed the animals, birds and fish as a symbol of
sharing.
Mukkanuma (, ,$$--+ +# #)
The fourth day is called Mukkanuma (6"71!) which is popular among the non



vegetarians of the society. On this day, farmers offer prayers to the elements (like soil, rain,
fire for helping the harvest) and the (village) goddesses with their gifts which sometimes (and
these days mainly) include animals. People in Andhra and Telangana do not eat any meat (or
fish) during the first three days of the festival and do so only on the day of Mukkanuma.
Kanuma, Mukkanuma and the day following Mukkanuma call for celebrations with union of
families, friends, relatives. People play with kites and the sky is filled with beautiful kites.
Another notable feature of the festival in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is the Haridasu and
Gangiredduvallu who go early in the morning with a colourfully decorated cow. Haridasus
sing songs of Lord Vishnu (Hari); hence the name Haridasu (servant of Hari). It is a custom
that he should not talk to anyone and only sing songs of Lord Vishnu when he goes to
everyone's house.
Maharashtra
Multicolored sugar halwa surrounded by til-gul (sesame and jaggery) ladoos. These exchanged and eaten on Makar Sankranti in Maharashtra
In Maharashtra on Makar Sankranti (मकर संक्रािन्त ) day people exchange multicoloured halwa
(sugar granules coated in sugar syrup) and til-gul laadoo (sweetmeats made from sesame
seeds and jaggery). Gulachi poli/puran poli (गुळाची पोळी / पुरण पोळी) (flat bread stuffed with
soft/shredded jaggery mixed with toasted, ground til [white sesame seeds]) and some gram
flour, which has been toasted to golden in pure ghee, are offered for lunch. While exchanging
til-gul as tokens of goodwill people greet each other with the words "ितळगुळ घ्या , आिण गोड-गोड
बोला / til-gul ghyaa, aani goad-goad bolaa" meaning ‘Accept this til-gul (sweet) and utter
sweet words’. The underlying thought in the exchange of til-gul is to forget the past ill
feelings and hostilities and resolve to speak sweetly and remain friends.
Married women invite friends/family members and celebrate Haldi-Kunku. Guests are given
til-gul and some small gift, as a part of the ritual. Women make it a point to wear black
clothes. As Sakranti falls in the winter season, wearing black adds to the body warmth. This
is an essential reason behind wearing black, which is otherwise barred on festival days. As



per another legend, Lord Surya forgave his son Shani and his son visited him on Sankranti.
And that's why people distribute everyone sweets and urge them to let go of any negative or
angry feelings. While distributing sweets famous line “til gul ghya and god god bola” (which
means eat this sesame and jaggery and speak sweet words) is used in Maharashtra.
Telangana
The people of Telangana also celebrate Sankranti similar to their neighboring states of

which marks the end of harvesting season in the month of Maagha (January–February).[24] It
is the Assam celebration of Makar Sankranti, with feasting lasting for a week.[25]
The festival is marked by feasts and bonfires.[26] Young people erect makeshift huts, known
as Meji and Bhelaghar, from bamboo, leaves and thatch, and in Bhelaghar they eat the food
prepared for the feast, and then burn the huts the next morning.[27] The celebrations also
feature traditional Assamese games such as tekeli bhonga (pot-breaking) and buffalo
fighting.[28] Magh Bihu celebrations start on the last day of the previous month, the month of
"Pooh", usually the 29th of Pooh and usually the 14th of January, and is the only day of
Magh Bihu in modern times (earlier, the festival would last for the whole month of Magh, and
so the name Magh Bihu).[29] The night before is "Uruka" (28th of Pooh), when people gather
around a bonfire, cook dinner, and make merry.

cooked kohada (red pumpkin) that is prepared specially with sugar and salt but no water.
The meal is generally accompanied by tilkut and lai (laddu made of til, chuda and rice). The
festive meal is traditionally made by women in groups. Since the meal is heavy, lunch is
generally skipped on the day and the time is, instead, spent on socializing and participating
in kite flying festivals.
At night a special khichdi is made and served with its four traditional companions, "char
yaar" (four friends) – chokha (roasted vegetable), papad, ghee and achaar. Since such a rich

the Pahari word for Sakranti, start of the new month. Hence this day marks the start of the
month of Magha.
According to Hindu religious texts, on the day of Uttarayani the sun enters the zodiac sign of
Makara (Capricorn), i.e., from this day onwards the sun becomes 'Uttarayan' or it starts
moving to the north. It is said that from this day, which signals a change of season, the
migratory birds start returning to the hills. On Magha Saaja people wake up early in the
morning and take ceremonial dips and shower in the springs or baolis. In the daytime people
visit their neighbours and together enjoy khichdi with ghee and chaas and give it in charity at

Odisha
The festival is known as Makara Sankranti in Odisha[35] where people prepare makara chaula
(Odia: ମକର ଚାଉଳ): uncooked newly harvested rice, banana, coconut, jaggery, sesame,
rasagola, Khai/Liaa and chhena puddings for naivedya to gods and goddesses. The
withdrawing winter entails a change in food habits and intake of nourishing and rich food.
Therefore, this festival holds traditional cultural significance. It is astronomically important for
devotees who worship the sun god at the great Konark temple with fervour and enthusiasm
as the sun starts its annual swing northwards.[36] According to various Indian calendars, the
Sun's movement changes and the days from this day onwards become lengthier and
warmer and so the Sun-God is worshiped on this day as a great benefactor. Many
individuals at the start of the day perform a ritual bath while fasting.[36] Makara Mela (Fun fair)
is observed at Dhabaleswar in Cuttack, Hatakeshwar at Atri in Khordha, Makara Muni temple
in Balasore and near deities in each district of Odisha. In Puri special rituals are carried out
at the temple of Lord Jagannath.[36] In Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar, Kalahandi, Koraput and
Sundargarh where the tribal population is greater, the festival is celebrated with great joy.
They celebrate this festival with great enthusiasm, singing, dancing and generally having an
enjoyable time. This Makara Sankranti celebration is next to the Odia traditional new year
Maha Vishuva Sankranti which falls in mid April. Tribal groups celebrate with traditional
dancing, eating their particular dishes sitting together, and by lighting bonfires.
It is the only Indian festival celebrated on a fixed day of the Gregorian calendar. Besides the
usual rituals, people of Orissa, especially Western and Southern Orissa, reaffirm the strength
of the bond of friendship with their best friends during this occasion. The practice is called
‘Makara Basma’or 'Makara Basiba'. After a man binds himself with one of his friends in the
shackles of friendship during Makar Sankranti, afterwards he addresses the other as
‘Maharshad’ or ‘Marsad’; if two women tie the friendship lace on each other's wrist, they call
each other ‘Makara’. They don't utter each other's name. This goes on for one full year till
the next Makar Sankranti. In Eastern Orissa, on many occasions, two friends feed each other
‘Mahaprasad’, the offering made in the famous Jagannath temple of Puri, and continue the
friendship for at least one year. Orissa Post talks to some women about their experiences



when they tied the friendship knot on Makar Sankranti.
Punjab
Main article: Maghi
Mela
In Punjab, Makar Sankranti is celebrated as Maghi which is a religious and cultural festival.
Bathing in a river in the early hours on Maghi is important. Hindus light lamps with sesame
oil as this is supposed to give prosperity and drive away all sins. A major mela is held at Sri
Muktsar Sahib on Maghi which commemorates a historical event in Sikh history.
Culturally, people dance their famous "bhangra". They then sit down and eat the sumptuous
food that is specially prepared for the occasion. It is traditional to eat "kheer", rice cooked in
milk and sugarcane juice. It is also traditional to consume khichdi and jaggery. December
and January are the coldest months of the year in the Punjab. Maghi represents the change
of the season to warmer temperatures and increase in daylight. Maghi fairs are held in many
places.
Rajasthan and Western Madhya Pradesh (Malwa & Nimar)
"Makar Sankrati" or "Sakraat" in the Rajasthani language[37] is one of the major festivals in
the state of Rajasthan. The day is celebrated with special Rajasthani delicacies and sweets
such as pheeni (either with sweet milk or sugar syrup dipped), til-paati, gajak, kheer, ghevar,
pakodi, puwa, and til-laddoo.[38]
Specially, the women of this region observe a ritual in which they give any type of object
(related to household, make-up or food) to 13 married women. The first Sankranti
experienced by a married woman is of significance as she is invited by her parents and
brothers to their houses with her husband for a big feast. People invite friends and relatives
(specially their sisters and daughters) to their home for special festival meals (called as
"Sankrant Bhoj"). People give out many kind of small gifts such as til-gud (jaggery), fruits,



dry khichadi, etc. to Brahmins or the needy ones.

Jaipur and Hadoti regions is filled with kites, and youngsters engage in contests trying to cut
each other's strings.[39]
Tamil Nadu
Main article: Thai Pongal
The Tamil festival of Pongal coincides with Makar Sankranti, and celebrates Surya.
It is a four-day festival in Tamil Nadu:
Day 1: Bhogi Pandigai (ேபா$ ப%&ைக)
Day 2: Thai Pongal (ைத ெபாŋகl)
Day 3: Maattu Pongal (மா./p ெபாŋகl)
Day 4: Kaanum Pongal (கா1m ெபாŋகl)
The festival is celebrated four days from the last day of the Tamil month Margazhi to the third
day of the Tamil month Thai.
Bhogi
The first day of festival is Bhogi (ேபா$). It is celebrated on the last day of Margazhi[40] by
throwing away and destroying old clothes and materials, by setting them on fire, marking the
end of the old and the emergence of the new. In villages there will be a simple ceremony of
"Kappu Kattu" (kappu means secure). The 'neem' leaves are kept along the walls and roof of
the houses. This is to eliminate evil forces.



Thai Pongal

The second day of festival is Thai Pongal or simply Pongal. It is the main day of the festival,
falling on the first day of the Tamil month Thai which starts with the solar cycle when sun
starts moving towards the summer solstice (uttarayana). It is celebrated by boiling rice with
fresh milk and jaggery in new pots, which are later topped with brown sugar, cashew nuts
and raisins early in the morning and allowing it to boil over the vessel. This tradition gives
Pongal its name. The moment the rice boils over and bubbles out of the vessel, the tradition
is to shout "ெபாŋகேலா ெபாŋகl (Ponggalo Ponggal)!" and blow the sangu (a conch), a
custom practised to announce it was going to be a year blessed with good tidings. Then,
new boiled rice is offered to the Sun god during sunrise, as a prayer which symbolises
thanks to the sun for providing prosperity. It is later served to the people in the house for the
ceremony. People prepare savouries and sweets such as vadai, murukku, payasam and visit
each other and exchange greetings.
Maattu Pongal
Jallikattu, or "taming the bull", is an ancient Pongal tradition.
The third day of festival is Maattu Pongal (மா./p ெபாŋகl). It is for offering thanks to cattle,
as they help farmers in agriculture. On this day the cattle are decorated with paint, flowers
and bells. They are allowed to roam free and fed sweet rice and sugar cane. Some people
decorate the horns with gold or other metallic covers. In some places, Jallikattu, or taming
the wild bull contest, is the main event of this day and this is mostly seen in the villages.



Kaanum Pongal
The fourth day of the festival is Kaanum Pongal (கா1m ெபாŋகl: the word kaanum means
"to view"). During this day people visit their relatives, friends to enjoy the festive season. It is
a day to thank relatives and friends for their support in the harvest. It started as a farmers
festival, called as Uzhavar Thirunaal in Tamil. Kolam (ேகாலm) decorations are made in front
of the house during Thai Pongal festival.
Uttar Pradesh
The Kumbh Mela, now renamed as Maha Kumbh Mela by UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath (the Ardh Kumbh Mela now being renamed as Kumbh Mela) at Prayaga Sangam, the world's largest pilgrimage gathering every 12 years, is a Makar Sankranti-related event.[12]
The festival is known as Kicheri in Uttar Pradesh and involves ritual bathing.[41] Over two
million people gather at their respective sacred places for this holy bathing such as
Allahabad and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and Haridwar in Uttarakhand.[42] If they cannot go in
river then they bathe at home. There is a compulsion to bathe in the morning while fasting;
first they bathe then they eat sweets such as til ladoo and gud laddo (known as tillava in
Bhojpuri). At some places new clothes are worn on this day.
Kite flying is an inevitable part of the festival in Uttar Pradesh,[42] as with many states of India
such as Gujarat and Maharashtra. Like other places in India, the references to sweets, til
(sesame seeds) and gud (jaggery) are found in the songs sung on this day:
Meethe Gur me mil gaya Til,
Udi Patang aur khil gaye Dil,
Jeevan me bani rahe Sukh aur Shanti,
Mubarak ho aapko Makar-Sankranti.
Uttarakhand



In the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand, Makar Sankranti is celebrated with great gusto. The
Uttarayani fair is held in the month of January every year in Bageshwar[43][44] The religious
ritual of the fair consists in bathing before daybreak at the confluence of Saryu and
Gomati.[45][46] After Bathing, an offering of water to Lord Shiva inside the Bagnath Temple is
essential.[45] Those who are more religiously disposed, continue this practice for three days
in succession, which is known as "Trimaghi".[45]
According to Indian religious texts, on the day of Uttarayani also called Ghughuti (घुघुित) in
Kumaon, the sun enters the Zodiacal sign of 'Makara' (Capricon), i.e. from this day onwards
the sun becomes 'Uttarayan' or it starts moving to the north. It is said that from this day,
which signals a change of season, the migratory birds start returning to the hills. On Makar
Sankranti people give Khichadi (a mixture of pulses and rice) in charity, take ceremonial dips
in holy rivers, participate in the Uttarayani fairs and celebrate the festival of Ghughutia or
Kale Kauva. During the festival of Kale Kauva (literal translation 'black crow') people make
sweetmeats out of sweetened flour (flour and gur) deep fried in ghee, shape them in shapes
such as drums, pomegranates, knives, and swords. These are fed to crows and other birds.
West Bengal
A feast at Poush Sankranti
In West Bengal, Sankranti, also known as Poush Sankranti[47] named after the Bengali month
in which it falls (last date of that month), is celebrated as a harvest festival Poush Parbon
(Bengali: '/01 /"%23). (It falls on 14 January on the Western calendar.) The freshly harvested
paddy and the date palm syrup in the form of Khejurer Gur (Bengali: '456788 9:)and Patali
(Bengali: /";"$* ) is used in the preparation of a variety of traditional Bengali sweets made
with rice flour, coconut, milk and 'khejurer gur' (date palm jaggery) and known as 'Pitha'
(Bengali: $/7<). All sections of society participate in a three-day festival that begins on the
day before Sankranti and ends on the day after. The Goddess Lakshmi is usually worshipped
on the day of Sankranti.
In the Himalayan regions of Darjeeling, the festival is as known as Magey Sakrati. It is
distinctly associated with the worship of Lord Shiva. Traditionally, people bathe at sunrise
and then commence their pooja. Elsewhere, many people take a dip in places like Ganga



Sagar (the point where the river Ganges meets the Bay of Bengal).[48] Ganga Sagar falls in
West Bengal.
In the day of Makar Sankranti Hindu God Dharma is worshiped. And khichurhi or rice is
offered to the God as Bhog ('(")). The day after Makar Sankranti the first day in the month
Magh from Bengali calendar The Goddess Laxmi devi is worshiped. It is called Baharlaxmi
Puja as the idol is worshiped in an open place.
The festival is known as Maghe Sakranti by Hindus in Nepal, and above is a traditional basket dance festivity to celebrate it.

Nepalese
Main article: Maghe Sankranti
Maghe Sankranti (Nepali and Maithili: माघे सङ् क्रािन्त , Nepal Bhasa: घ्यःचाकु संल्हु ) is a Nepalese
festival observed on the first of Magh in the Bikram Samwat Hindu Solar Nepali calendar
(about 14 January), bringing an end to the ill-omened month of Poush when all religious
ceremonies are forbidden. On this day, the sun is believed to leave its southernmost position
and begin its northward journey.
Maghe Sankranti is observed by Nepalis Hindu by bathing at the confluence of rivers and
praying to the sun.[50] The popular bathing sites include Sankhamul on the Bagmati river near
Patan; in the Gandaki/Narayani river basin at Triveni near the Indian border; Devghat near
Chitwan Valley and Ridi on the Kaligandaki; and in the Koshi River basin at Dolalghat on the
Sun Koshi. On Maghe Sankranti Cha puja and on Bhadra Purnima, some Nepalis worship
perform Nara puja for the community's protection from evil.[51] Festive foods like laddoo,
ghee and sweet potatoes are distributed to relatives and friends. The mother of each
household wishes good health to all family members.
Pakistan (Sindh)
On this festive day, Sindhi parents send ladoos and chiki (Laaee) made of sesame seeds to
their married daughters. The Sindhi community in India too celebrate Makar Sankranti as
Tirmoori which involves parents sending sweet dishes to their daughters.[52]
Sri Lanka
On this day, the Sri Lanka Tamil farmers honor the Sun God Suriyapakaran. This happens
when the sun enters the zodiac sign of Capricorn (Makara). The Thai Pongal festival is
celebrated in mid-January, or the Tamil month of Thai, to coincide with the rice harvest.[53]
