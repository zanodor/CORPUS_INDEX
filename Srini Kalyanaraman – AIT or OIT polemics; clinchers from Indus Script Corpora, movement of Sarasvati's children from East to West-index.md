AIT or OIT polemics; clinchers from Indus Script Corpora, movement of Sarasvati's children from east to west
--Three pure tin ingots of Haifa shipwreck, Anau Indus Script seal and 2nd m BCE silver axe
--these artifacts with Indus Script hieroglyphs settle the polemics; earliest evidence of Indus Script is dated to ca. 3300 BCE from Harappa potsherd reported by HARP team
three tabernae montana flowers as hypertext. tagara 'tabernae montana' rebus tagara 'tin' PLUS kolmo 'three' rebus kolimi 'smithy, forge'; thus Tin Smithy-forge is the hypertext
--Priest, fire-altar, Gelot, Tajikistan, 3rd m. BCE are Indus Script hypertexts; Vakhsh to Bishkent cultures, East-West movement ca. 2500 to 1500 BCE
I submit that the AIT, OIT polemics will be resolved with the successful decipherment of Indus Script of Meluhha, Indian sprachbund, which has been conclusively established with the identification of hieroglyphs on three pure tin ingots discovered in Haifa shipwreck.

"The height of this urban development was reached in the Middle Bronze Age also
known as Integration Era as per Massimo Vidale, corresponding to Namazga
Depe level V (c. 2400-2000 BC). Namazga Depe reaching c. 52 hectares and holding
maybe 17–20,000 inhabitants, and Altyn Depe with its maximum size of c. 25
hectares and 7-10,000 inhabitants, were the two big cities in Kopet
Dag piedmont.This urban development is considered to have lasted, not from 2400
BC, but from c. 2250 to 1700 BC by Lyonnet and Dubova's recent publication. It is
this Bronze Age culture which has been given the BMAC name. Gonur Depe is the
largest of all settlements in this period and is located at the delta of Murghab river in
southern Turkmenistan (Margiana region) with an area of around 55 hectares. An
almost elliptical fortified complex, known as Gonur North includes the so-called
"Monumental Palace", other minor buildings, temples and ritual places, together with
the "Royal Necropolis", and water reservoirs, all dated by Italian archaeologists from
around 2400 to 1900 BCE...New archaeological research has recently found at three
ancient cemeteries in southwestern Tajikistan called Farkhor, Gelot, and Darnajchi,
ceramics influenced by Namazga IV and Namazga V transitional period from Early to
Middle Bronze Age, which can suggest a presence of BMAC inhabitants in this
region earlier considered out of their influx. Gelot's grave N6-13 was dated to 2203
2036 cal BC (2 sigma), and Darnajchi's grave N2-2 as 2456-2140 cal BCE
(2sigma). Farkhor's cemetery is located on the right bank of Panj river, very near
the Indus Civilization's site Shortughai."(Frenez, Dennys, (2018). "Manufacturing and

Location of Vakhsh river as affluent of Oxus river
Vakhsh Culture (2500 BCE -1650 BCE) pre-dates Bishkent Culture (ca. 1700–1500 BCE)
The Vakhsh culture is a Bronze Age culture which took place around 2500-1650 BC, as shown by radiocarbon dates. Teufer, Mike, (2020). "The 'classical Vakhsh culture': A Bronze Age culture of the 3rd and early 2nd millennium BC in southern Tajikistan", in The World of the Oxus Civilization, Routledge, Abstract: "...It can now safely be dated between the second half of the 3rd millennium and the 17th century BC as shown by radiocarbon dates and is thus contemporary with the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC)..."

Preceded by ?
Followed by Bishkent culture
The Bishkent culture or Beshkent culture is a late Bronze Age archaeological culture of southern Tajikistan, dating to c. 1700 – 1500 BC. It is primarily known from its cemeteries, which appear to have been used by mobile pastoralists.
The Bishkent culture has been seen as a possible contributor to the Swat culture, which in turn is often associated with early Indo-Aryan movements into northwest India. (Mallory, J. P.; Adams, Douglas Q. (1997). "Bishkent culture". Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture. Taylor & Francis. p. 68.)

These are two of the objects found in Farkhor and Gelot cemeteries in Tajikistan, exhibited until today this year 2022 at Musee Guimet, France. They are dated to 2500-2000 BC, and could belong to Vakhsh culture:
1) Cross-shaped ritual vase from the necropolis of Farkhor/Parkhar, Tajikistan, middle–late 3rd millennium BC. 2) Anthopomorphic statuette (orant?) in soft stone (anhydrite) from the burial ground of Gelot, Tajikistan, late 3rd millennium–early 2nd millennium BC. See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vakhsh_culture
Metal remains are scant, but include razor-like knives and mirrors. Arrowheads were made of bone and flint. (Mallory, J. P., & Douglas Q. Adams, (1997)...Vakhsh culture ceramics are a mixture of steppe wares and those ascribed to the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex. Some have interpreted this as a sign that the Vakhsh culture represented a mixture of settled agriculturalists and steppe populations originating in the north.Some have identified the Vakhsh culture as a southern extension of the Andronovo culture, but Mike Teufer considers it is not related to Andronovo, but to communities of Altai-Xinjiang area...Like the Bishkent culture, the Vakhsh culture has been linked with the southward migration of the Indo-Aryans.

“The taxila cross at Lahore Cathedral, Pakistan. There hangs on one of the walls of the Lahore Cathedral, a small framed cross. This is the famous Taxila Cross found just outside the ruins of Sirkap in 1935. This was a time when a book titled The Acts of Saint Thomas was well known. Discovered in 1822 in Syria, the book told of how St Thomas, having been assigned by Christ to preach the Gospel to the Indians, arrived by boat in the capital of King Gondophares.” https://www.dreamstime.com/royalty-free-stock-images-taxila-cross-lahore-cathedralpakistan-there-hangs-one-walls-small-framed-image31286869
'Taxila cross' "In Lahore Cathedral, there hangs on the wall,
at the upper end of the nave in the recess to the right, a small cross in a glass frame. The inscription below records that it was found in 1935 and donated to the church by Mrs Cuthbert King (Mr King then being the Deputy Commissioner at Rawalpindi). Nothing surprising about a cross in a church, except that this particular relic goes by the name of the Taxila Cross. Because it was found just outside the fortification wall of Sirkap (one of the ruined cities of Taxila), it is taken by believers as a sign of the arrival of Christianity in our part of the world at the time that Sirkap lived."http://odysseuslahori.blogspot.com/2014/07/TaxilaCross.html

It is clear that the 'Taxila Cross' is a hoax. A + symbol, together with svastika symbol are hieroglyphs of Indus Script. The + symbol signifies a fire-altar with the indications of dotted circles on four corners which signify dhã̄ ī 'strand' rebus: dhatu 'mineral ore'. Svastika symbol signifies hieroglyph sattva 'svastika symbol' rebus: sattva, jasta 'pewter, zinc'.

These powerful narratives are also validated -- archaeologically attested -- by the discovery of Mohenjo-daro priest wearing (on his forehead and on the right shoulder) fillets of a dotted circle tied to a string and with a uttarīyam decorated with one, two, three dotted circles. The fillet is an Indus Script hypertext which reads: dhã̄ i 'strand' PLUS vaṭa 'string' rebus: dhāvaḍ 'smelter'. The same dotted circles enseemble is also shown as a sacred hieroglyph on the bases of Śivalingas found in Mohenjo-dar. The dotted circles are painted with red pigment, the same way as Mosonszentjanos dice are painted with red iron oxide pigment.

"Mike Teufer, in his 2020 publication, informs that recent archaeological research in southwestern Tajikistan at three cemeteries in Gelot, Darnajchi, and Farkhor, present features that belong to Vakhsh culture. Grave 13 from Gelot, in necropolis 6, dated to 21972049 cal BC (1 sigma) and 2203-2036 call BC (2 sigma) contained a round-bottomed pot of type IIIB, a bowl of type IVG, and a carinated beaker of type ICa, and all these vessel types are similar to the pottery found in kurgans of the "classical Vakhsh culture." In Farkhor, the presence of type IAa vessels also offer evidence for the early dating of Vakhsh culture, appearing already in the middle of the 3rd millennium BC, in the transition from Namazga periods IV and V. Darmajchi's grave 2 also presented a high dating, 24562140 cal BC (2 sigma)...Teufer also comments that: "It is therefore evident that the Vakhsh culture is more likely a phenomenon of the 3rd millennium than of the 2nd millennium BC. However, unlike the 'classical Vakhsh graves', the tombs at Gelot and Darnajchi have no visible aboveground, kurgan-like construction and should therefore be distinguished from them. The underground part of the tomb is nevertheless similar - namely, a simple pit (Gelot, necropolis 6, grave 13) or catacomb (Darnajchi, necropolis 2, grave 2).".(Teufer, Mike, (2020). "The 'classical Vakhsh culture': A Bronze Age culture of the 3rd and early 2nd
millennium BC in southern Tajikistan", in The World of the Oxus Civilization, Routledge, pp. 698 - 733.)

The extent of the BMAC (according to the Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture)
Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (short BMAC) or Oxus Civilization, recently
dated to c. 2250–1700 BCE.
Archaeological cultures associated with Indo-Iranian migrations (after EIEC).
The Andronovo, BMAC and Yaz cultures have often been associated with Indo
Iranian migrations. The GGC (Swat), Cemetery H, Copper Hoard and PGW cultures are
candidates for cultures associated with Indo-Aryan migrations.
Bactria is derived from the Ancient Greek: Βακτριανή (Romanized Greek term: Baktrianē)
(modern Balkh).
"Regionalization Era begins in Anau IA with a pre-Chalcolithic phase also in the Kopet
Dag piedmont region from 4600 to 4000 BC, then the Chalcolithic period develops from
4000 to 2800 BC in Namazga I-III, Ilgynly Depe, and Altyn Depe. During this Copper Age,
the population of the region grew. Archaeologist Vadim Mikhaĭlovich Masson, who led
the South Turkmenistan Complex Archaeological Expedition of 1946, saw signs that people
migrated to the region from central Iran at this time, bringing metallurgy and other
innovations, but thought that the newcomers soon blended with the Jeitun farmers...Major
chalcolithic settlements sprang up at Kara-Depe and Namazga-Depe. In addition, there were
smaller settlements at Anau, Dashlyji, and Yassy-depe. Settlements similar to the early level
at Anau also appeared further east– in the ancient delta of the river Tedzen, the site of
the Geoksiur Oasis. About 3500 BC, the cultural unity of the area split into two pottery
styles: colourful in the west (Anau, Kara-Depe and Namazga-Depe) and more austere in the
east at Altyn-Depe and the Geoksiur Oasis settlements. This may reflect the formation of two
tribal groups. It seems that around 3000 BC, people from Geoksiur migrated into
the Murghab delta (where small, scattered settlements appeared) and reached further east into
the Zerafshan Valley in Transoxiana. In both areas pottery typical of Geoksiur was in use. In
Transoxiana they settled at Sarazm near Pendjikent. To the south the foundation layers
of Shahr-i Shōkhta on the bank of the Helmand river in south-eastern Iran contained pottery
of the Altyn-Depe and Geoksiur type. Thus the farmers of Iran, Turkmenistan and
Afghanistan were connected by a scattering of farming settlements."(Vidale, Massimo,
(2017). Treasures from the Oxus, p. 9, Table 1; Masson, V. M. (1992). "The Bronze Age in



18
Khorasan and Transoxiana". In Dani, A. H.; Masson, Vadim Mikhaĭlovich (eds.). History of
civilizations of Central Asia. volume 1: The dawn of civilization: earliest times to 700 BCE.)
The people of the BMAC culture were very proficient at working in a variety of metals
including bronze, copper, silver, and gold. This is attested through the many metal artefacts
found throughout the sites.
"The discovery of a single tiny stone seal (known as the "Anau seal") with geometric
markings from the BMAC site at Anau in Turkmenistan in 2000 led some to claim that
the Bactria-Margiana complex had also developed writing, and thus may indeed be
considered a literate civilisation. It bears five markings which are similar to Chinese "small
seal" characters. The only match to the Anau seal is a small jet seal of almost identical shape
from Niyä (near modern Minfeng) along the southern Silk Road in Xinjiang, originally
thought to be from the Western Han dynasty but now thought to date to 700 BCE."

Antenna hilted swords from Bactria compare with Fatehgarh copper hoard sword (See comments of BB Lal at http://archaeologyonline.net/artifacts/19th-century-paradigms-5):
The metalwork in Gonur Tepe may explain the presence of Fatehbad type of sword in Gonur Tepe caused by migrations of people from Sarasvati-Sindhu river valleys into the Gonur region. Migrations are attested in Baudhāyana-Śrautasūtra Chapter XVIII.44 contains an important reference attesting to the migrations of two groups of people away from Kurukshetra region (Sarasvati River basin).
"Translation of BSS XIII.44: Ayu migrated eastwards. His (people) are the Kuru-Pancalas and the Kasi-Videhas. This is the Ayava (migration). Amavasu migrated westwards. His (people) are the Ghandhari, Parsu and Aratta. This is the Amavasu (migration).
"According to the correct translation, there was no movement of the Aryan people from anywhere in the north-west. On the other hand, the evidence indicates that it was from an intermediary point that some of the Aryan tribes went eastwards and other westwards.
This would be clear from the map that follows, noted BB Lal (2009).
