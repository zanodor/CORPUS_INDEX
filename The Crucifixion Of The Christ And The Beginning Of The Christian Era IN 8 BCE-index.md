Beginning Of The Christian Era IN 8 BCE

The Crucifixion Of The Christ And The
Beginning Of The Christian Era IN 8 BCE
Abstract
The Scythian monk Dionysius Exiguus is best known as the
inventor of the fictitious Anno Domini dating, begun 525 years
"since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ".
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_Exiguus
Since Jesus is believed to have lived for 33(3-3-srii-srii >king of
kings,agnishToma) years,his crucifixion and death is placed in 33
AD(CE) .
But these years/dates do not agree with the actual birth and
death years of the historical Son of God,the Roman emperor,
Augustus Caesar(INRI), born in Beth-melech(Bethlehem).
Julius Caesar was the first historical Roman to be officially
deified as Divus Iulius (the divine/deified Julius/Sol Invictus) by
decree of the Roman Senate on 1 January 42 BC. The appearance
of a comet during games in his honour was taken as confirmation
of his divinity. Though his temple was not dedicated until after his
death, he may have received divine honours during his
lifetime and shortly before his assassination, Antony had been
appointed as his flamen (priest). Both Octavian and Antony
promoted the cult of Divus Iulius. After the death of Caesar,
Octavian, as the adoptive son of Caesar, assumed the title
of Divi filius (Son of the Divine).

The Julian Calendar was opened on 1 January 45 BC.

Emperor Augustus died On 19 August AD 14 and not 33 CE.As
seen above ,samaadhi being samaa aadi the CE reckoning should
have begun then with the death of the Son of God in that year.
But the Julian(Hari/Kali/Rg/putra/harta/harit/Hijra)
Calendar was begun 1st January 45 BCE. On the Ides of March (15
March) of 44 BC,Julius Caesar was assassinated. Later he was
formally deified by the Roman Senate as Divus Iulius on 1
January 42 BC , and Caesar Octavian henceforth became Divi
filius ("Son of the divine"). Julius Caesar was deified by naming
the month July after him in the Roman calendar. On 16
January 27 BC, on his own insistence, the Roman Senate granted
Octavian the surname Imperator Caesar Augustus(Aga
astya/Aga-asta/ Hari-asta/Christ , , ,
, ,, ,, ,
, , ). Historians use this name to refer to him from
27 BC until his death in AD 14 .
The name Augustus was inherited by all future emperors,
eventually becoming, in practice, the main title of the emperor. As
a result, modern historians usually regard this event as the
beginning of Augustus' reign as "emperor"/INRI

. The fish as ashTa/ra/agni/masta/dasma/na-ashTa/
soma being Octavian was also the early symbol of
Christianity. Augustus also styled himself as Imperator Caesar
divi filius, "Commander Caesar son of the deified one". With
this title, he boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar, and
the use of imperator signified a permanent link to the Roman
tradition of victory(Sol Invictus). He transformed Caesar, a
cognomen for one branch of the Julian family(cf.Surya
vansa/Hari vansa) , into a new family line that began with him.
Augustus was deified in his lifetime itself by naming the month
of August after him in 8 BCE . Untill his time it was
called Sextilis (named so because it had been the sixth-sat-shad
ashTa-dasa-sata-mangala) month of the original Roman
calendar.July and August have both 31 days so that the son sitting
on the right arm of the father is equal the father/Julius/ Soma/
Thoma/Bharata/Peter and Paul as taught in the Christian creeds



of faith! The earliest known creed in Christianity, "Jesus(Gaius/
Caesar) is Lord", originated in the writings of Paul the Apostle.
The cross is Leo-house or sign of the sun/Hari/ Rg/ suurya/
varsha/ praja/putra/ deva/veda/ sruta/ sutra/suta/stu/ vatsa/
vatsanaabha.Even though Octavian was named Augustus in
27 BCE,the month of August was named after him only in 8
BCE,which marks the samaadhi/crucifixion/samaa adi/true
beginning of the Augustan Era/Christian Era. One of the most
widely used Christian creeds is the Nicene Creed, first
formulated in AD 325 at the First Council of Nicaea, presided
over by emperor Caesar(Jesus/Sol Invictus) Constantine.
Constantine's sun god coin: Christianity and the
cult of Sol Invictus
Bronze coin issued by Constantine in AD317. The reverse shows the sun god Sol Invictus, referred to as 'Companion of the Emperor'.

This bronze coin showing Sol, the sun god, was minted in small
quantities between 313 and 326 AD by Saint Constantine (307



337 CE), the Great—the Roman Emperor known as the
"Thirteenth Apostle" in the East.
The Roman solar cult of Sol Invictus (Latin: the unconquered sun
god) was characterized by the core belief in a single, supreme sun
god Sol. This cult helped the rapid rise of Christianity in the late
Roman Empire. The origins of the cult in the late 1st century BCE
can be traced to the appeal of Mithraism(cf.Visvamitra/
Kausika/Indra) among the Roman imperators(Julius and
Augustus) and the military due to their exposure to Persian/
Indian culture during their campaigns in the East and trade
relations with India. Mithra/Sol was a solar deity who later
became Christ.The early Romans worshipped Greek Hellenistic
deities, like Apollo and Helios—the sun god, known to the
Romans as Sol/Jul(sol) ius/surya/sun. As Augustus became the
mon-arch/soma-raaja/samraaja/son of god, he took on the
combined attributes of Apollo(Paul), Helios and Mithra. The early
Roman Emperors promoted the rising cult of Sol Invictus with
the addition of numerous new temples, statues, rites and festivals
created in Sol's name. By promoting the cult and the
consolidation of divine power into Sol, Augustus and his
successors were able to please the military and enhance their
own power by identifying Sol as the source of imperial
legitimacy-the son(ra-ja/pu-tra/soter) of the sun
god(ra/sol/Julius). Christianity as a more powerful version of
Sol worship , replacing the Sun God with the Son of God. The
emperors were able to promote themselves as the personification
of Sol on earth. The "radiate" crown , worn by emperors
on their coins' portraits during the 3rd century AD shows the
solar connection to the emperor’s power.
Constantine in the early 4th century advanced the pagan cult of
Sol Invictus to the height of its popularity. Among his efforts was
the minting of this special coin dedicated to Sol. Constantine also



built his famous Arch in Rome, inscribed with several
references to Sol Invictus, and positioned it carefully to align
with the colossal 100' bronze statue of Sol that adjoined the
Coliseum at the time. The rising popularity of the worship of the
son of god (the monarch-Pontifex Maximus-Pater patrie himself/
Christianity) in Rome was a factor in Constantine’s later adoption
of Christianity as the Empire's official religion . Sol Invictus was
renamed as son of god/Christ. Constantine was not baptised until
he was on his deathbed., Constantine’s coins continued to display
images of traditional Roman gods – Jupiter, Mars, and in
particular the sun god, Sol Invictus even after AD 312 .
Constantine did not suppress or abolish traditional beliefs, and
even constructed new temples in his city of Constantinople,
where a statue depicted him wearing the radiate crown of Sol.
This is a bronze follis minted by Constantine I, The Great. The
reverse shows Sol, the sun god, wearing a radiate crown—symbol
of victory, and holding a globe—symbol of world rule. The
inscription reads SOLI INVICTO COMITI (In honor of the
unconquered sun god, the companion of the emperor). The
emperor's bust, name and titles appear on the obverse.
Constantine, obviously ,wanted a single unified religion for the
empire, with himself at its head as the Christ.
Many ancient customs and rituals of sun worship survived in later
Christian festivals and traditions.The nimbus or halo that often
surround the head of Christ in images is remarkably similar to
images of ancient solar cult deities. Festivals at Christmas and
Easter are associated with ancient solar rituals at the Winter
Solstice and Vernal Equinox.
