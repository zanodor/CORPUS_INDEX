Deities with a dual character on Ancient Near East cylinder seals
In this paper I discuss five imprints of cylinder seals depicting deities with a dual character: they are servant as well as queen, father as well as mother, and one of them is the god of the constellation Gemini.
Number 1 Iskhara Iskhara
There are three people on this imprint:
1. A woman who wears a headpiece decorated with a pair of horns, 2. A man who wears a headpiece without horns 3. And a woman who sits on a throne and wears a headpiece with three pairs of horns.
The man in the middle is probably the owner of the seal and humans generally have no horns on their headgear. But the two women are one and the same, namely Iskhara. She is a scorpion goddess and on the imprint she is identified by the two scorpions next to her.
She is depicted on the left as a servant, because in March she follows the sun and she is only visible in the evening when the sun has set. But she is a queen in June, because then she goes ahead of the sun and she is visible before the sun rises.
Because the scorpion goddess changes from being a constellation visible in the evening into a constellation visible in the morning she looks at two directions: as a servant she looks from left to right and as a queen she looks from right to left. Besides that, the direction of the scorpions also changed: the first one looks up, whereas the second scorpion looks down.
By the way, this imprint shows that differences in status is symbolized by the headgear:
1. The owner of the seal, probably a priest of the scorpion goddess, does not wear horns. 2. Iskhara following the sun god like a servant wears one pair of horns 3. But, when she like a queen precedes the sun then she wears three pairs of horns.

Number 2
On this imprint is a man has two heads, one of them looks at a mermaid and the other one looks at a woman who takes a man by the hand. According to the inscription this two-headed man is the sun god Utu and the mermaid as well as the guiding woman are his wife Aya.
According to me the ‘story’ of this imprint goes as follows: in June Utu and Aya celebrate a Holy Marriage and the sun god becomes the father a child, undoubtedly the owner of the seal. This child is born in February/March in the constellation Anunitum, which means ‘godly fish wife’, (Now Aya is depicted as a mermaid).
mulA.NU.TI.TUM [a-nu-ni-tum] (= Anunitum= godly fish wife) (NE Pisces (+ middle part of Andromeda)).) A-nu-ti-tum
The two balls explicitly indicate that this mermaid is the sun god's wife, because these balls together form number 20, and 20 is the symbol of the sun god.
When this child has grown up, Aya, now depicted as a human, takes him to his father who has to determine the life destiny of his son.
So we see that the sun god and his wife both have two functions:
1. In the first place they give life to the owner of the seal. 2. And in this second place they give him a destiny.



Number 3
Leo Bow Sirius Corvus Taurus Gemini Usimu
On this print we see another god with two heads. This two headed god is usually called Usimu or Isimud. On this print various constellations are shown through which the sun goes through in the spring. It follows that Usimu is the god of the zodiac sign Gemini. (It is also possible that Usimu is the god of the New Moon, when the sun and the moon are ‘united’.)

Number 4
On this print we see a double headed eagle with two naked youngsters. The two youngsters are one and the same person, namely the owner of the seal. He is depicted two times because Ashur gives him life twice, namely the moment he is conceived and the moment he is born. And thus the two heads of the eagle show that Ashur has a dual nature, he begets the owner of the seal like a father and gives him life as a mother during his birth.

Number 5
This print shows two cows with three heads: the cow on the left seems male, while the cow on the right could be feminine. I think that two times the three heads are the heads of the sun god, the moon god and the Sirius goddess:
1. On the left the three-headed but may engender a child, the owner of the seal, in June 2. And on the right the three-headed cow goddess give birth to this child in April.

Number 3 British Museum number: 89115 Title: The Adda Seal Description: A hunting god (full-face) has a bow and an arrow (?) over his shoulder; a quiver with tassel attached hangs on his back. On the left-hand mountain stands a small tree and Ishtar (fullface) who is winged and armed with weapons including an axe and a mace rising from her shoulders. She is holding a bush-like object, probably a bunch of dates, above the sun-god's head. The sun-god Shamash with rays, holding a serrated blade, is just beginning to emerge from between two square topped mountains. The water god Ea stands to the right with one foot placed on the righthand mountain. He stretches out his right hand towards an eagle, probably the Zu bird who stole the tablets of destiny. A couchant bull lies between his legs and streams of water and fish flow from his shoulders. Behind him stands his two-faced attendant god Usimu with his right hand raised. All wear the multiple-horned head-dresses of deities. The male figures are bearded and Usimu has a double beard and wears a flounced skirt. Ea and Ishtar both wear flounced robes and the fourth complete figure wears a striped skirt which either has a cod-piece or is hitched up in front. This god wears his hair in a long curl down the left side, reminiscent of those worn by bull-men and Ishtar has two similar curls hanging down, one on either side, while Ea and Shamash wear their hair in a triple bun. The scales of the mountain are continued in a horizontal band all-round the lower part of the seal and it is on this band that the figures are standing. There is a two-line inscription in a frame and below it a lion is pacing towards the right and roaring. The cylinder is slightly concave in shape.
