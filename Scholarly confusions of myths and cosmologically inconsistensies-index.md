Scholarly confusions of myths and cosmologically inconsistensies
MYTHICAL AND COSMOLOGICAL CONFUSIONS AND
INCONSISTENSIES
If searching for information of a deity, one is very often presented
for inconsistent interpretations and very often with the same
theme inconsistency all over the place. It seems that many
scholars work after a consensus scheme that seriously lack logics
when analyzed deeply. All kind of deity and celestial objects and
symbols are mixed up and can be found because many scholarly
interpreters doesn't have the overall mythological and
cosmological view and knowledge.
For instants, one of the founders of “Comparative Mythology”,
Friedrich Max Muller, (1823 – 1900), Professor of Comparative
Philology - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_M%C3%BCller
foremost compared myths via their linguistic similarities and he
led a school of thought which interpreted nearly all myths as
poetic descriptions of the sun's behaviour. According to this his
theory, these poetic descriptions had become distorted over time
into seemingly diverse stories about gods and heroes and
necessarily not by their mythological and cosmological meanings.
In fact was/is his theories themselves distorted by not having a
broader and universal approach to the myths and the
cosmological meanings. Unfortunately his fundamental
comparative mythology ideas of the Sun as the main deity run
trough many later scholarsʼ works and have made a school of
reduced mythological understanding which confused and
inconsistent heritage still today hinder a genuine mythical



understanding. The Sun is of course very important – but it is still
a minor deity compared to deities connected to the Creation
Stories. Read more here of different (also inconsistent methods
by themselves) interpretation approaches to comparative
mythology: Link:

The Velikovski confusion
When Velikovski made his "Worlds in Collision" he FIRST studied
the myths (i.e. the myths of creation) and THEN he superimposed
these mythical tellings, for instants “Venus being born out of
Jupiter ́s forehead”, onto the planets because these much later
than the ancient creation myths were given some of the same
names as in the creation myths.
In this way, the ancient myths of creation were interpreted to
count for planets only and not in their right context. With such
interpretation of myths, outright replacing celestial creation
myths to the different formation theories of planets, these
authors of course also have to distort their citing of text and
cherry picking words and sentences out of context.
Quote from
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet#Mythology_and_naming
“The names for the planets in the Western world are derived from



the naming practices of the Romans, which ultimately derive from
those of the Greeks and the Babylonians.
In ancient Greece, the two great luminaries the Sun and the Moon
were called Helios and Selene; the farthest planet (Saturn) was
called Phainon, the shiner; followed by Phaethon (Jupiter),
"bright"; the red planet (Mars) was known as Pyroeis, the "fiery";
the brightest (Venus) was known as Phosphoros, the light
bringer; and the fleeting final planet (Mercury) was called Stilbon,
the gleamer”.
Here, the planets are named after their natural appearances and
not after any prime gendered deity from the Stories of Creation
as with Velikovski and his followers. To replace the ancient deities
of creation for the planets is of course pure nonsense, which
distorts both the myths and the logical astronomy.
If Velikovski and his followers have read this Greek natural
description of the planets, they never would have written any of
their books at all, and even if they had analyzed the mythical texts
of creation thoroughly, plain logics should have hindered them
from writing their books in the first place.
Example of lost mythical connection and interpretive
inconsistency
I want to analyse the Norse mythological word of “Jord” as in
Moder Jord (Mother Earth) the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jord
say: “Jörð is the common word for earth in Old Norse, as are the
word's descendants in the modern Scandinavian languages;
Icelandic jörð, Faroese jørð, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian jord.
In Norse mythology, Jörð (Icelandic "earth" sometimes Anglicized



as Jord or Jorth) and also called Jarð jɑrð as in Old East Norse, is
a female jötunn”.
AD: So what is this female “jötunn”? (Notice the word
jord/Jord/earth/Earth is described both in capital and small
letters. Are we talking of “soil” or planet Earth?)
“A jötunn often glossed as giant) is a being in Norse mythology, a
member of a race of nature spirits with superhuman strength.
Their otherworldly homeland is Jötunheimr, one of the nine
worlds of Norse cosmology, separated from Midgard, the world of
humans, by high mountains or dense forests”.
AD: And where is the “homelands of these giant jötunns”
located?
“Jötunheimr (or Jǫtunheimr; often anglicized Jotunheim) is one of
the Nine Worlds and the homeland (heim 'home') of the Giants of
Norse Mythology — Rock Giants and Frost Giants”.
AD: The 9 Worlds in Norse Mythology are parts of 3 prime
Worlds, namely Midgard; Asgard and Udgard which each are
divided in 3 parts. Humans live in Midgard, in the middle of the
worlds on the Earth. Asgard contents the Sun; the Moon, the 5
Planets and the stars and star constellations. In Udgard “lives”
the Norse Jaetter; the Giants where the largest figures
observable on the night sky can be seen as the Milky Way
contours, which are directly connected to the stories of creation.
So: Udgard is located on the night sky as the white Milky Way
band which whole contours surrounds the Earth as the Midgard
Serpent.
“In Norse mythology, Þrymr (Thrymr, Thrym; "uproar") was king



of the jotnar. His kingdom was called Jötunheimr, but according
to Hversu Noregr byggdist, it was the Swedish province
Värmland, then a part of Norway”.
AD: Here we have a typical scholarly example of a celestial myth
that is completely forgotten and “grounded in the firm landscape”
and has become a mere “geo-myth”. The Milky Way mythy
cosmologcal meaning is forgotten and the contours gives name
to a geographical location and the mythical story and its celestial
connection and meaning is broken.
Conclusion:
The researched word of “Jord” refers to a giant female jötunn in
Udgard, the location of the giant Milky Way figures that is
connected to the Story of Creation. The “female jötunn” refers
therefore to the formation of the first land, i.e. the Primeval
Mound in the centre of our galaxy, initially created by an explosion
of light that sets the 4 basically elements in motion. The
mythically word “Jord” means therefore “soil” and not the planet
Earth.
The “female jötunn” is a cosmic female principle connected to
the giant Milky Way figure on the southern hemisphere that forms
the physical elements into all kind of shapes and forms in the very
centre of the Milky Way galaxy. As such “she” has physically
formed everything in our galaxy, including everything in our Solar
System.
With this conclusion, the mythical the meaning of the mytheme of
“Jord = Soil” is again reconnected to the right celestial objects
and it all gives perfectly meaning and logics.



MORE ON THE VELIKOVSKY CONFUSION
David Talbott, administrator and owner of the
ThunderboltsProject Forum and author of "The Saturn Myth", is
interviewed in this Youtube video - "The Electric Universe, The
Saturn/Sun Swap" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=re2CIoReSB4
David Talbott is inspired by Immanuel Velikovsky and his book,
"Worlds in Collision".
In timestamp 9w30 DT specifically speaks of the “huge electric
forces which creates jets from the Milky Way center”. One then
should think that this central force of electric light of creation of
the Milky Way represents one of the prime archetypes in the
numerous cultural Stories of Creation – and it really does so, but
DT interpret this archetype to represent planet Saturn, the “sun”
because he excludes and ignores the overall starry and Milky Way
archetypes in his hypothesis.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way_(mythology)
33w10 The origin of the similar global mythical theme is very easy
to understand: We all live on the same planet Earth, in the same
Solar System, in the same Milky Way galaxy and in the same local
part of the observable Universe. The story of this entire scenario
is embedded in all ancient myths as the Stories of Creation.

DT mentions “the shutting down of Anthony Peratt” – just like DT
is shutting down constructive critique from his forum members by
banning them from his forum. Two members with genuine
mythical expertise were shut down in one week (May 8, to 12)
where the profiles of “Norman” and “Grey Cloud” were
“permanently banned” when participating in this Forum Topic

the prime Roman Pantheon Milky Way deity, Saturnus

permanently banned for doing so in my ThunderboltsProject

49w16 David “can ́t find the Moon in the ancient Sky”. “The
celestial crescent is noticed in the myths, but it is not the Moon”.
Here DT assumes this crescent is connected to Saturn, disk.
49w59 DT: The history of “the great spectacular crescent figure in
the sky” was historically ascribed to the Moon which caused a
huge confusion.
I agree in this. Because this spectacular crescent is in fact the
grey/white crescent contours of the Milky Way which is
observable except from the lighter period of the seasons. This



structure is seemingly revolving around the Earth celestial axis,
which of course isn ́t the case with the planets and it never has.
The Milky Way Crescent here - http://www.native
science.net/MilkyWay.GreatestGod.htm
This Milky Way figure resembles the prime male god in the Sky, in
the Roman Pantheon Mythology called Saturnus
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(mythology) - The names
from the Roman Pantheon (Milky Way realms) were given to
planets when the Roman Empire adopted Christianity and had to
abandon their ancient pantheon of male and female deities. This
fooled Immanuel Velikovsky and all his later followers, David
Talbott included, to believe in all kinds of catastrophic planetary
events, which is pure science fiction based on misinterpreted
myths. Besides this: Connecting ancient archetypes of creation to
planets is exactly what they do in popular astrology too.
I ́m sure David Talbott ́s collection of myths is huge and he is
fairly good to intellectually compare the myths of creation - but
he ascribes the correct myths to the wrong celestial objects and
their motions in the Sky - resulting in his video series "Symbols of
an Ancient Sky" and his "alien polar configuration".
It isn ́t the ancient Sky which is alien, but David Talbott ́s
mythical interpretation which is alienated by his narrow focus on
planets only. He himself alienates the ancient Myths of Creation
by reducing these to count for planets where they mostly regards
the Milky Way contours, star constellations and yes, also the
planets which just were called "wandering stars" which of course
don ́t revolve around the Earth celestial pole axis.
59w24 DT: “It is important in these days of revolutions in science
that we put a premium at openness and eagerness to be



corrected”.
Oh, jah? Does this high standards fit with banning members with
a second opinion on the TBP-Forum? Members who tries to post
constructive critique, especially on the mythical interpretations
and understanding in the forum?
David Talbott isn ́t himself "open and eger for corrections", I can
tell you that from own experiences with him. Besides this, the
future of the Electric Universe in the TBP regie will never be
bright as long as David Talbott isn ́t open and eager for
corrections in the line with the contents here.

By Mario Livio
If you go out at night in a rural, unlit area, especially when the
Moon is below the horizon, you cannot miss that band of hazy
light that seems to be arcing across the sky. Neither did ancient
civilizations miss this bright streak we now call the Milky Way, and



they came up with a variety of imaginative, mythical explanations
for it. Most North American Indians, for instance, regarded the
Milky Way as the pathway that souls follow on their way to the
other world. To many Australian Aboriginals, on the other hand, as
well as to most people of Asia (e.g., in China, India, Japan, Korea,
and north Siberia), the Milky Way was a river, a silvery, shining,
celestial stream (in Sanskrit it is called “Ganges of the heavens”).
On the other side of the globe, the Peruvian Inca also believed the
Milky Way to be a great, heavenly river, from which the thunder
god drew the water that he poured down as rain.
The phenomenon of different mythologies coming up with similar
stories was not uncommon. In the lore of both the Finnic people
(indigenous populations of Estonia and Finland) and the Baltic
people (of Latvia and Lithuania), as well as in the Turkic and Tatar
languages, the Milky Way is known as “the birdsʼ road.” This
name apparently reflected the observation that migratory birds
tend to use the Milky Way as a guide on their way north.
Where then did the name “Milky Way” come from? As with so
many other concepts in the Western tradition, the first to
associate the Milky Way with milk were the ancient Egyptians.
The source of the milk was supposed to be the divine cow Bat, a
deity later combined with the parallel cow-goddess Hathor. But
the actual name “Milky Way” (in Greek, “Galaxias“) was derived
from Greek mythology (“milk” in Greek is “gala“). According to
legend, Zeus allowed his infant son Herakles (born to a mortal
woman) to breastfeed on the milk of Zeusʼ divine wife Hera, while
the latter was asleep. Upon waking up, Hera tore her breast from
the infantʼs lips, and the milk that spurted out formed the Milky
Way (the event is beautifully depicted in Tintorettoʼs painting
“The Origin of the Milky Way,” Fig. 1). A similar story appears in
Roman mythology, involving the goddess Opisʼ attempt to



salvage her newborn son Jupiter from being swallowed by her
husband Saturn. Even the Buryats of Siberia share somewhat
similar legends.
The first to suggest (in the fifth century B.C.E.) that the Milky Way
might consist of very distant stars were the Greek philosophers
Anaxagoras and Democritus. While Aristotle was of a different
opinion, Democritusʼ views were supported by observations in
the sixth century by Olympiodorus the Younger, and later by a
number of Arab and Persian astronomers (including al-Biruni, al
Jawziyya, and al-Din al-Tusi).
Several confusions of Mythical Symbols
If taking the Stories of Creation for granted, our ancestorʼs view
of the universe was somewhat limited to the knowledge of our
Milky Way galaxy. That is: They also knew of the 4 basically
elements which floats in the Primordial Waters in the vast abyss in
space because many cultures describe these elements as
“Primeval Deities” that creates everything in the Universe.
In the following, I'll explain several prime mythical symbols,
beginning with the telling of creation and how these symbols are
misunderstood and confused because of lack of mytho
cosmological knowledge; how myths and symbols are
disconnected because the scholarsʼ doesn't take the myths
cosmologically seriously and/or because the scholars ignore the
Milky Way myths which are directly connected to the Stories of
Creation.
The 4 Elements in the Mythical Cosmic Abyss
The 4 elements are mythological described with Water, Fire, Air,



and Soil. The modern cosmological terms of these are: Hydrogen,
Helium, Oxygen and Particles. Accordingly to modern science,
99.99 % of cosmos is filled with the gaseous elements and just
00.01 % is filled with the “metallic” particles. Link:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogdoad
The Enclosed Milky Way Light
The 4 elements are set in motion of a cosmic explosion (Initial
Primeval Light Deity) that moves the gaseous and particle
elements in a cosmic molecular cloud. (Blow of the Primeval Wind
Deity) The gasses and particles swirls and heats up via the
electric ionization from the explosion; electromagnetic circuits are
created which sorts out and melt the particles together in the
swirling magnetic centre. (Volcanic and “earthquake” deities)
When the critical melting point is reached in the centre, a huge
light is created in the pregalactic centre. (The Galactic Central
Light) This light is also called “The Enclosed Light” because of
the formation of the galactic arms that surrounds this central
light.
This galactic light deity is scholarly very often mythological
misinterpreted by many scholars as “the Sun deity” - that is not
even created on this stage of creation.
The Primeval Mound
When this very luminous melting point is reached, the particles
form the first firm land, the Primeval Mound from where the first
contours rise in the Milky Way. From and on this Primeval Mound,
both “rock” and “water” deities of creation are created and
mythological described, giving birth to everything in our galaxy.
Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benben



The mytheme of “Primeval Mound” in the galactic centre is very
often confused by scholars to be of real mountains on the Earth.
The Tree of Eden
The creative formation in our Milky Way galaxy centre gives form
and life to everything and this formation and cycle of life is
mythological symbolized as a huge Tree standing in the middle of
the creation garden i.e. in the Milky Way centre from where
everything is formed and “expulsed” out in the surrounding of the
galaxy centre. (The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden)
The Great Goddess
Some creation myths have a male being and some have a female
being (both human- and animal-like beings) as the first creation in
the Milky Way centre. Somehow it is most logical to have a female
deity as the first one to be created because of the physical
formation that takes place in the Milky Way centre.
The Milky Way centre is located in the star constellation of
Sagittarius observable on the Earth southern hemisphere. The
southern hemisphere Milky Way contours can easily be depicted
as a woman with the Milky Way centre located on the female
figures location of the womb. (The Cosmic Womb) From this
centre, the female figure is giving birth to everything in the
galaxy, including herself. (The Parthenogenetic Virgin Mother)
Very often the mytheme of the great Milky Way Goddess is
scholarly interpreted as “Mother Earth” because of the confusion
between the elementary “soil” and planet Earth. Link:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Nature where this and other
very severe confusions appears all over the place.



The Great God
The telling of a Virgin giving birth to a heavenly son refers to the
Milky Way Mother who, without having a physical meeting with a
male, gives birth to what become the contours of the Earth
northern hemisphere Milky Way male-like contours. This northern
half Milky Way contour also represents the husband of the Milky
Way Mother Goddess and together they represent the first Milky
Way creator deities, whether these Milky Way contours are
described as human- or animal-like beings – or both. These
figures also represent the 2 first human beings, in the Bible called
Adam and Eve. Link: http://www.native
science.net/MilkyWay.Mytology.Keys.htm
The Serpent
The fully Milky Way band that surrounds the Earth, represents the
Great Serpent; The Winged Serpent or Dragon; the Midgard
Serpent in the Norse Mythology and the Ouroboros Symbol.
Symbols with serpents and snakes are directly connected to the
Milky Way matters, especially because of the full Milky Way
serpent band around the Earth.
The Expulsion from Eden
This telling is not about Adam and Eve making any sinful act at all.
It just and only deals with a telling of the creative movement in
our galaxy where everything is created in the centre of the galaxy
and fairly gently is slung out (“expulsed out”) in the galactic
surroundings – quite opposite of the modern perception of the
galactic formation and explanation that is wrong and scientifically
contradicted via the “galactic orbiting anomaly”.
Crescent Symbols



Of course the Moon can provide symbols of crescent shapes, but
so can indeed the 2 hemisphere Milky Way vaulting figures if
imaging these as 2 separate figures located on both
hemispheres.
Very often these Milky Way deities are scholarly interpreted and
connected to be lunar deities, which of course is very illogical,
connecting the supreme creator qualities to the inferior qualities
of the Moon that even isn ́t created in this stage of the creation
story.
Cresent Ships
These crescent symbols often depict stylized mythical ships of
the supreme Milky Way deities that revolve around the Earth
celestial poles, often confused as a "solar bark". See below.
The Celestial Poles
When imaging the 2 Milky Way hemisphere figures seemingly
revolving in the night sky together with the circumpolar stars and
constellations, these figures are revolving around the Earth's
polar rotation prolonged axis. This configuration marks the
Celestial Pole where the northern Milky Way male deity and the
southern Milky Way female revolve around these polar centres.
These 2 polar configurations are also very often confused by
scholars to be a solar symbol of a ring with 4 spokes as for
instants in the very strange and confused theory of the “Saturn
Myth”, of David Talbott. Link: http://www.saturn-myth
delusion.net/
The Flood



In many cultures the Milky Way is mythological described as the
Heavenly River which is seemingly running around the Earth.
When scholars know nothing of the Milky Way Mythology, they
easily confuse this myth as being a concrete and historic flood
that once over flooded the Earth, whereas the real meaning of
course is “floating over the Earth, in the heaven”.
Geo-Myths
In Norse mythology, Þrymr (Thrymr, Thrym; "uproar") was king of
the jotnar. His kingdom was called Jötunheimr, but according to
Hversu Noregr byggdist, it was the Swedish province Värmland,
then a part of Norway. (Read the full explanation in the beginning
paragraph of “Example of lost mythical connection and
interpretive inconsistency”).
Many myths are scholarly misunderstood because of this
geographical and historical approach to mythical interpretation.
When mentioned this sad affaire, I ́m fully aware that many
cultures also marked the celestial objects and their movements
via several marking systems on the ground and in the surrounding
landscape.
