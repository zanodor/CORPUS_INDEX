PREFACE.
As the chronology of ancient Egypt has of late ex
cited considerable attention among those who attach
interest to the history of the primaeval world, it ap
peared to the author of the following pages, that some
service might be rendered to this branch of study, by
a careful inquiry into the first elements of the chrono
graphical art among the inhabitants of that country ;
that is to say, their methods of computing and divid
ing time by months, years, or other periods.
The first of the five sections into which this disser
tation is distributed, treats generally of the peculiari
ties of the form of year used by the Egyptians ; more
especially as regards the influence which those pecu
liarities may have exercised, or have been supposed
to exercise, on their modes of calculating and record
ing the dates of their civil history. As the ancient
authorities on these points are neither few nor unim
portant, and as they have already been examined often



VI PREFACE.
and at great length by the most distinguished chrono
logers of modern times, little new matter could here
be expected. But I have endeavoured to collect and
arrange in as simple and concise a form as the nature
of the inquiry permitted, every thing of moment that
has hitherto been asserted or conjectured by my pre
decessors in the same investigation ; drawing, how
ever, my own conclusions, and offering such illustra
tions, as may serve either to correct the errors into
which foregoing writers may appear to me to have
fallen, or to throw additional light on our general
subject.
The three following sections are devoted to a more
minute analysis of the primitive form and probable
origin of the egyptian calendar, astrological and
civil ; and of the effect produced on the superstitions
and other habits of the people, by the early connexion
and subsequent separation of these two departments
of the same institution. The system which I have
here ventured to propose is, I believe, entirely new.
It was first suggested during a course of inquiry into
other points of egyptian antiquity, by observation of
certain curious coincidences, which, though not in
themselves enough to justify any conclusions, were
yet sufficient to provoke farther researches ; the result
of which has been to augment the number of these
coincidences so considerably as to impress on my mind
the belief, that they could not be the effect of mere
chance ; and I have no hesitation in declaring my
own conviction, that in these three sections have been
pointed out not only the real origin of the zodiac, but



PREFACE. VII
the primitive form and mysterious import of at least
one half of its signs. Those to which I would refer
more particularly, are Aries, Gemini, Cancer, Leo,
Virgo, and Libra.
That a system combining and resting upon so many
obscure and enigmatical details, should be restored at
once complete in all its parts, was not to be expected,
for several obvious reasons ; among others, for this
very simple one, that the department of antiquarian
science to which this inquiry belongs is still in its
infancy ; many of the facts or monuments which have
afforded the most striking illustrations of our subject
having only been brought to light within these few
years—some even since these researches were first
undertaken ; and at this moment others are, or may
be, in course of publication, which may help to fill
the remaining gaps in the circumference of the egyp
tian astrological sphere.
The fifth and concluding section has been devoted
to the examination of the probable period and cir
cumstances of the first introduction of the zodiac into
Greece—a question essentially connected, as shall be
shown, with our previous analysis of its egyptian
origin.
Some general elucidations of our subject, or of
matters of critical interest connected with it, the dis
cussion of controverted points, &c. which could not
conveniently be inserted in the pages of the text, have
been added in an appendix.
As much of what is new in the following work
rests upon the evidence of the recent discoveries in



Vlll PREFACE.
hieroglyphic literature, which have excited so much
interest of late ; and as the reality of a portion of
those discoveries, at least to the full extent claimed
by their authors, has been questioned, and in some
instances perhaps justly ; it might be thought neces
sary, that whoever attempts to ground any argument
on their authority, should enter into some preliminary
explanation how far he considers them entitled to
confidence, and of the motives which have induced
him to form his opinion. As this, however, would
open a field of discussion far too wide to be com
prehended within the plan of this essay, I shall be
contented with stating my conviction, that the system
of hieroglyphic interpretation chiefly developed by
Mons. J. F. Champollion, in his Precis du Systeme
Hieroglyphique, is substantially correct. With regard
therefore to the appeals which I may have occasion
to make to individual portions of that system, where
there occurs no reasonable ground of doubt, I shall
not hesitate, according to the usual principle of cita
tion of authority, to quote them as matter of fact ;
where the case is not so clear, I shall either in the
text or annotations state my reasons for agreeing or
differing.
Not having been able to procure a supply of coptic
types, where I have had occasion to introduce words
of that language, I have made use of greek capitals
as a substitute. Of these, the greco-egyptian or coptic
characters are, as is well known, merely a corruption ; '
with the exception of five or six added to convey
certain sounds to which there is nothing correspond



PREFACE. IX
ing in the greek tongue, and the representatives of
which, in the ancient written language of Egypt,
have therefore been retained, and transferred to the
modern alphabet. Of these supplementary characters,
I have caused a number sufficient for present use to
be cut.
Upon all occasions numerous references have been
given to the most esteemed authors who have already
treated, in many instances separately, and more at
length than was consistent with the limits of my
text, the various subjects on which I have had occa
sion to touch, in as far as my opportunities of procur
ing their works, often from their very nature scarce,
would permit. This I trust the candid reader will
attribute not to any anxiety on the part of the author
to display reading, but to a desire, however valueless
his own labours may prove, of rendering at least some
service to those who may be entering on the same
line of pursuit, by pointing out the sources from
whence materials for more extensive and successful
investigations are to be derived.

SECTION I,
GENERAL REMARKS ON THE EGYPTIAN YEAR AND
CANICULAR CYCLE.
Those who have devoted any attention to the anti
quities of Egypt, will be aware, that a cycle of 1460
years, formed upon a difference of a quarter of a day,
between the length of the civil year in use among its
inhabitants, consisting of three hundred and sixty-five
days, and the more nearly accurate tropical or Julian
year of three hundred and sixty-five days and a quar
ter, occupies a prominent place in all discussions rela
tive to the early history and chronology of that em
pire, and has given rise to a considerable deal of con
troversy among the learned of modern times ; the
investigation of the details of its primitive formation
and use, involving an inquiry into all the minor points
of the very obscure history of the egyptian calendar."

subject of the egyptian year. Geminus, Elementa Astronomise, c. yi.

A few observations on the origin and general proper
ties of this cycle, will therefore form the basis of the
ensuing illustrations. For although it may in itself,
strictly speaking, be considered as the whole or sum
mary, of which the remaining portions of our subject
are merely parts or elements, yet, as will readily ap
pear in the sequel, the peculiar character of this in
vestigation renders the, analytical mode of inquiry
preferable.
There have been some, who, adopting an exagger
ated view of the antiquity and extent of the astrono
mical science of the Egyptians, as well as of the fide
lity of their historical annals, seem to have held, that
if the dates of events of remote and fabulous ages be
recorded in years of this cycle, they ought, admitting

transmitted, to be assumed as fixed and standard
epochs, by which the remainder should be regulated,
as by a true test of correctness ; somewhat as events
of obscure and doubtful periods of later history, if
recorded in connexion with eclipses, or other pheno
mena of the heavenly bodies, are assumed by prefer
ence as chronological pivots. The following example
may serve for illustration. The first strictly histori
cal epoch of the egyptian annals, is that of the expul
sion of certain Asiatic tribes, called Pastors or Shep
herds, who, in the early ages of the world, had occu
pied, to the prejudice of the aboriginal inhabitants,
the whole or greater part of the country. This de
liverance was effected by the victorious arms of a
native prince commonly called Amosis, by some
Thoutmosis, who forced the strangers to abandon
their last hold, a strong city called Avaris on the
frontiers of Arabia, and finally established the Miz
raimite sway over the whole valley of the lower Nile j
hence honoured by his native historians with a place
at the head of a dynasty, the eighteenth in their lists.
This was an event of the highest importance, and
such as must have formed a standard historical aera ;
and been likely, above all others, had the chronologi
cal art been as far advanced at the time as some
would suppose, to have been accurately recorded by
every known method, astronomical or civil.
But on consulting the various extant fragments of
egyptian history, even amid all their uncertainties,
and the corruptions of the texts of the authors in
whose works they have been preserved, we have suf
ficient proof that a very considerable difference must
have existed, in the relative antiquity assigned by



4 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
different native annalists to this epoch. According"
to the text of Manetho, a celebrated historian of this
country, as preserved by Africanus, the accession of
the eighteenth dynasty would be dated about the year
I67O b. c. According to a different version of the
same author given by Eusebius, it would fall about
1725 b. c. And in another national document, called
'*. the old Egyptian Chronicle," it is placed about 1748 b. c.b But Clemens Alexandrinus,c himself an
Egyptian, and well versed in the antiquities of his
own country, fixes, apparently on the authority cf
Ptolemy the Mendesian, (another native historian of
equal celebrity with Manetho,) this same epoch of the
b The numbers of the years contained in the dynasties up to the nine
teenth inclusive, according to these various authorities, are given in my
Remarks on the chronology of the egyptian dynasties ; and may also be
seen in a note to p. 142 of the 85th Number of the Quarterly Review.
For the eighteenth dynasty, we must add to the lists of Africanus 263
years ; to those of Eusebius and the Old Chronicle, 348. The same dyn
asty, with Josephus, (contr. Ap. i. § 15. ed. Haverc. t. ii. p. 446.) who
has affected to preserve its details, after Manetho, with a scrupulous de
gree of accuracy, assigning the fractional months of each reign, compre
hends 333 years. Several modern authors, (Larcher, Herod. t. vii. p.
153. edit- 1786. Faber, Pagan Idolatry, vol. iii. p. 534. Hales, Analys. of
Chronol. vol. iv. pp. 419. 422. edit. 1830) misled, it would appear, by an
error in the Latin version of Havercamp, have stated the numbers of the
Jewish historian at 340 years 7 months. These M. Champollion Figeac
(Lett. i. sur le Mus. de Turin, p. 95) has adopted, as the basis of an at
tempt to reconcile the discrepancies in the statements of the ancients
concerning this point of egyptian chronology. Theophilus of Antioch
(Ad. Autol. ad calc. Justin. M. edit. 1743, p. 392) has also given, after Ma
netho, a list of the eighteenth dynasty, similar, in as far as the corrupt
state of his text will permit of our judging, to that preserved by Jose
phus, from whom he has apparently copied it. The most important of
these texts on egyptian chronology, are to be found in the useful collec
tion of Mr. Cory, entitled, Antient Fragments—Lond. Pickering, 1828,
p. 47, sqq.

OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. I. 5
expulsion of the Shepherds and the commencement of
the eighteenth dynasty, to the 346th year before the
lapse of the sothiac cycle. This is the cycle above
alluded to ; which terminated, as shall be seen, in the
year 1322 b. c. Now, upon the principle above men
tioned, that dates attached to years of this cycle, are
to be considered as not only historically, but as it
were astronomically recorded ; and supposing that
Ptolemy the Mendesian, or Clemens, it matters not
which, had really, as there is no reason to doubt,
drawn his information from trust-worthy original re
cords ; it ought, amid the confusion and contradiction
which prevails among these authorities, to have the
preference ; and consequently, the sera of the acces
sion of Amosis, and of the expulsion of the Shep
herds, would be placed about 1668 b. c.
A very few observations, however, in the course of
the ensuing analysis, will, I trust, be sufficient to
show, that dates of this nature, in years of the cycle,
are in themselves no better than any others ; being
to all appearance merely proleptic ; matter of after
calculation, not of contemporary observation or re
cord ; as well as that the very history of the cycle
itself affords proof, that the learned men of Egypt
were much less advanced in either chronological or
astronomical science than their more enthusiastic ad
mirers have imagined, at the remote period to which
their historical records or their celestial observations
have been supposed to extend.
I shall endeavour to bestow upon this point, and
others of equal or greater difficulty and obscurity
connected with it, as close, and at the same time as
impartial an investigation as I am able. The anti
quities of this celebrated nation, in spite of all the



O ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
learning and ingenuity which have been devoted to
them, have been destined seldom to obtain a fair and
unprejudiced examination from the historical critic of
modern times. This is not very difficult to account
for ; when we consider the paucity of original docu
ments, the meagerness and obscurity of those which
exist, and the extreme vagueness and imperfection of
the information derived at second hand from the
classical authors of Greece and Rome. On all sub
jects of great extent or interest, the extravagance of
conjecture or of system is usually in proportion to
the slenderness of our means of accurate information.
Hence one need feel little surprise, if some, dazzled
by the splendour of the monuments still existing on
the banks of the Nile, or influenced by too servile a
deference to the vain-glorious traditions of the Egyp
tians themselves, and the exaggerations of credulous
Greeks, have been willing to give this people credit
for a degree of perfection in art and science of every
description, equal if not superior to any hitherto
attained by the most polished nations of christian
Europe, at a period when, according to all reasonable
probability, the human species, if already created,
could scarcely have advanced beyond the first steps
in civilization. Others, in combating these visionary
theories, have fallen into an opposite extreme of para
dox ; advancing opinions, and endeavouring to esta
blish systems, altogether derogatory, as well to the
real antiquity of this wonderful race, as to their just
rank in the intellectual scale of nations.
In the present inquiries I shall make every effort
to avoid the Scylla as well as the Charybdis, which
have proved fatal to so many voyagers in the straits
of egyptian research ; and in attempting to throw



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. I. 7
light on the calendar and the elements of the chron
ology of this ancient people, by combining and collate
ing all the more important fragments of classical an
tiquity bearing on the subject, with the evidence of
existing monuments, and more especially of that mass
of valuable material, which the enterprise of the
traveller or the labour and ingenuity of the learned
have, for the most part within the last thirty years,
added to this department of antiquarian science,—it
shall be my endeavour to banish all feeling of pre
judice, either favourable or adverse to the nation it
self, and all system but that of a careful investigation
. of truth.
The Egyptians having, at an early period of their
history, established an imperfect solar year of three
hundred and sixty-five days, soon found out that its
revolution did not produce the returns of the corres
ponding seasons, but anticipated them by nearly a
quarter of a day annually. This anticipation they
fixed by inaccurate observations at six hours precisely,
and hence it was easy to calculate that in 1461 revo
lutions of their own year, equal to 1460 of the tropical
year, their Thot or new-year's-day would, (according
to their own computation,) have retrograded from a
given point through the tropical year, so that after
the completion of that period, it would again coin
cide with the same day and season as it had done at
starting. If this was their notion of the cycle, as
there is little reason to doubt it was, it is hardly ne
cessary to observe that they were mistaken ; they
calculated that every fafcr year| they lost a quarter of
a day ; whereas they only lost five hours and nearly
forty-nine minutes ; since the true solar year really
contains upwards of eleven minutes less than the



8 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
julian year of 365i days ; so that the first day of the
egyptian year, after 1461 of its revolutions, instead of
having retrograded completely through the seasons,
would coincide with the corresponding day of the
julian year, when the sun was in a point of the zodiac
about twelve degrees in advance of that which it
occupied at the commencement of the period: Thus
the twentieth of July, O. S. of the year 1322 b. c,
on which day, as shall be seen below, a cycle began,
was fourteen days after the summer solstice ; but in
a. d. 139, when that cycle ended, the same day of the
julian year fell on the twenty-sixth day after the solstice.d
This excess of a quarterof aday, which theyassigned
the true solar year above their own, they either bor
rowed from, or connected with, the heliacal rising of
Sirius or the Dogstar, which they supposed recurred
at intervals of three hundred and sixty-five days and
a quarter ; and in this they seem to have been right ;
for although the true sidereal year exceeds the julian
time nearly as much as the tropical year falls short of
it, yet it would appear from the calculations of modern
astronomers,' that the intervals between the heliacal
rising of Sirius, in the latitude of Egypt, during the
flourishing ages of the empire, that is for upwards of
two thousand years before our Saviour, by a certain
concurrence in the positions of the heavenly bodies,
really were what the Egyptians supposed them to be.
The periods of the cycle were regulated by the coin

cidence of this phenomenon with the first day of Thot,
the first month of their year ; which coincidence, ac
cording to historical data, took place on the 20th of
July, in the year of Christ 139.f That year was
therefore the end of a cycle. Counting back 1460
years, we have the 20th of July of the year 1322 b. c.
for its commencement ; and if we count back other
1460 years, we shall have the year 2782 as the com
mencement of that which terminated in 1322. The
Dogstar was called in Egypt the star of Isis, or Sothis ;
hence the name of sothiac, or canicular cycle.
The explanation given by the Egyptians, or rather
by the Greeks for them, of this discrepancy between
their civil year and the true reckoning, on which their
cycle was grounded,—namely, that it was a point of
their national religion that every feast should fall suc
cessively on every day of each season of the year,
which was thus effected by their being attached to
certain days of their own calendar,8—is evidently a
mere after-excuse, invented to palliate an uninten
tional defect, rather than a reason for what was, in
itself, from the first, an intentional institution ; for,
besides that they would have overshot their mark, as
their feasts, instead of taking the days of the tropical
year in regular succession, would have fallen, during
four years, on the same day, and then passed on to
the next, it were in itself inconceivable that any people
6hould originally have established their festivals upon
such a principle ; for, as among all superstitious na

tions, and more especially those whose superstitions,
were so evidently founded on the phenomena of the
physical world, religious rites must, in their origin,
have borne reference to the various phases of the hea
venly bodies, as well as the necessary periodical ope
rations of agriculture, they must, from their very na
ture, have been essentially connected in their institu
tion with certain seasons. And that this holds good
of Egypt above all other states, must be obvious to
every person who has bestowed the least attention on
either the natural or civil history of the country. So
that to have celebrated the death of Osiris, which, ac
cording to themselves, was figurative of the low state
of the waters of the Nile and the decline of the sun
in the zodiac, in the month of May, when the sun was
rapidly advancing to the zenith, and the Nile just be
ginning to swell, would have been such an anomaly,
as might, indeed, have been brought about by a con
fusion of circumstances, and the obstinacy of a bigotted
people, but never could have been the effect of design.
It would, however, appear that some of their more
important solemnities did remain fixed to certain sea
sons, and, consequently, could not have been attached
to particular days of any month ; such were the har vest-home of Isis, described by Diodorus,h at which
the first-fruits of certain vegetables were offered, and
the sacrifice of hogs at full moon, mentioned by He
rodotus.' To these might, perhaps, be added the
Niloa, or festival of the inundation, described by Se
neca11 and Heliodorus,1 and apparently also noticed by

the father of grecian history.1" Other examples might
possibly be adduced ; but as the writers on whose au
thority they rest flourished after the introduction of
the julian year into Egypt, and as their illustrations
of the egyptian mysteries are given very confusedly,
partly with reference to the dates of the new calendar,
partly to those of the ancient year still in use among
the aboriginal inhabitants, the less attention is due to
them." The instances here quoted, however, are suf
ficient, for the present, to show, that some at least of
their feasts were originally assigned to certain seasons ;
and the same may, from the very nature of egyptiau
superstition, be inferred concerning the remainder.
Afterwards, amid the irregularities of their calendar,
those festivals whose ceremonies were so necessarily
dependent on the seasons, with respect to which they
were first instituted, that they could not possibly be
performed at any other, the harvest-home, for example,
or the Niloa, remained fixed, while others, where the
connexion was of less importance, continued attached
to their respective days of the national months, and
not to the degrees of the ecliptic ; and the priesthood,
rinding the year of three hundred and sixty-five days
a simple and convenient method of reckoning in other
respects, and unwilling to make any farther alteration
in their civil institutions, so repugnant to the feeling
of the nation at all times, sanctified this defect of the
calendar as a religious peculiarity, which distinguished
their national solemnities from those of their neigh
bours ; the motive of their primseval institution being
still kept in view among the priests themselves, and

forming probably, as we shall have occasion to observe
farther hereafter, an important part of those mysterious
significations so much celebrated as contained in all
the superstitious rites of this people.
Farther proof, if indeed any be required, that it
could not have been the original intention of the
egyptian legislators, in establishing their civil year, to
make its revolution fall short of the true solar time,
exists in the circumstance, admitted by themselves,
and proved by the whole tenor of their tradition, that,
in early periods of their history, they, like other na
tions in the infancy of civilization, used a year of three
hundred and sixty days, divided into twelve months
of thirty days each,0 which formed the basis of their
calendar as afterwards permanently settled, and which,
if adhered to without occasional correction, would, no
doubt, have caused their feasts to retrograde through
the seasons, but would have been far from making
them fall successively on each day of the solar year.
Now, as many of their superstitious rites may safely
be considered at least as ancient as their civil chrono
logy, it is clear, upon their own admission, that those
rites could originally have been established on no such
principle as that which we have just been examining.
As to the real nature of this year of three hundred

was allowed, like its successor, to anticipate the tro
pical time, so that its commencement falling back five
days and a quarter each revolution, would shift through
the seasons in about seventy years $ or whether it was
a lunisolar year, rectified occasionally by embolic
months, it would be in vain minutely to inquire, as

we have few or no historical data concerning it ; but
the latter opinion is certainly the most reasonable,
since it can hardly be supposed that any nation would
long submit to so very inconvenient an irregularity
as must otherwise have been the result. It was, how
ever, in order to obviate permanently, as they ima
gined, the perpetual fluctuation of the seasons, which
must have been consequent on a strict adherence to
their ancient mode of reckoning, that they established
their new form of year, by adding five supernumerary
days at the end of the twelve months. This additional
number of days they borrowed from rude observation
of the courses of the stars, as a more accurate guide
than the changes of the moon, which had been the
foundation of their primitive reckoning, calculating
these courses, in round numbers, at three hundred and
sixty-five days. And it is not to be believed that they
would, after once venturing upon such an innovation
on their ancient institutions, have been contented thus
only to reform their civil calendar by halves, substi
tuting a lesser for a greater error, had they at that
period known any more exact approximation to the
truth. There can, therefore, be no reasonable doubt
but that the Egyptians, in instituting their year of
three hundred and sixty-five days, believed, or hoped,
that its revolution would bring about the return of
the seasons, and that the sothiac cycle is, in fact, the
result of their disappointment.
The epoch at which these five days were perma
nently added is also mere matter of conjecture, not
being recorded by any trustworthy document, and the
statements of the classical authors concerning it being
vague and contradictory. SyncellusP ascribes the im

pears to consider as its author one Arminon ; which
name, however, does not occur in the lists of egyptian
sovereigns. The opinions of modern chronologers on
this point have been, as might be expected, much di
vided ; but those who have taken the most reasonable
view of the subject are agreed in supposing the insti
tution to have been of no very extreme antiquity, pro
bably not prior to the exodus, as there is much reason
to believe that the jewish legislator, who was learned
in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, was unacquainted
with any such institution. Sir Isaac Newton1 would
place it about nine hundred years before the christian
era ; but, as his opinion is grounded' on a system of
chronology which, however ingenious, is now gene
rally admitted to be fallacious, little weight can be at
tached to it. Dodwell8 carried his contempt of the
astronomy of the Egyptians so far as to maintain that
their solar year was no invention of their own, but
borrowed from the Persians, on the conquest of their
country by Cambyses. On the other hand, ZoegaV
admiration of the science of his favourite among the
nations of antiquity led him to deny that this imper
fect or moveable year was ever really in use among
them, but that they had the julian or tropical year
from time immemorial ; and hence he supposes, like
Dodwell, though on different grounds, that the other
was an institution of their conquerors, falsely attri
buted to themselves by the Greeks, who first became

acquainted with it in their country after the conquest.
The fallacy of both these opinions, eminent as is the
authority by which they are supported, is too obvious
to require to be pointed out minutely. Gatterer as
serts, that the year of three hundred and sixty-five
dajrs must have been used in Egypt in the seventeenth
century before Christ, because Cecrops brought it
with him into Attica? The learned chronologer does
not say how he ascertained this last fact, but I conceive
it would be somewhat difficult to discover authority for it.v The most plausible opinion, perhaps, is that
which supposes that the reform of the egyptian calen
dar took place in that same celebrated year 1322,
which was the period of the sothiac cycle, and that
they then transferred their new year's day from the
position in the seasons which it previously occupied
to the day whereon Sirius rose heliacally,—a pheno
menon of great importance in their mythology, as well
from their general superstitious reverence for that
brilliant star, . as from its appearance coinciding with
the inundation of the Nile, and being supposed to ex
ercise a physical influence on the rise of its waters.
The very circumstance that the cycle of 1460 years,
formed upon the deficiency of their new calendar, was
afterwards regulated by the coincidence of the Thot
with that particular day, is certainly strong ground
of belief, as has been observed by De la Nauze and
others," that the reform itself was accompanied by that

coincidence ;* and, if so, without taking an extrava
gant view of egyptian chronology, we can hardly as
sign it to any other epoch than 1322 b. c, as the year
2782, on which the commencement of the previous
cycle would fall, reaches too remote a period of anti
quity to justify the belief that even the egyptian state
was as far advanced in. civilization as the existence of
such an institution would lead us to infer. It is, how
ever, by no means inconsistent with probability, that,
the calendar having been reformed some time previous
to the year 1822, its Thot, or first day, being fixed at
a more advanced season, may, by retrograding towards
the solstice, have coincided with the heliacal rising of
Sirius in that year ; and this interesting coincidence
having been observed and recorded by the Egyptians,
may afterwards have aided them in regulating the pro
portion between their own and the tropical year, and
so have equally formed the basis of their cycle. This
seems to have been the view taken of it by Jackson/
who supposes the Thot, on the addition* of the epago
mense, to have been fixed about the autumnal equinox,
which opinion we shall have occasion to notice more
particularly in treating of the egyptian zodiac. Sir
Isaac Newton,* on the same principle, supposed the
Thot of the improved year to have been fixed about
the vernal equinox of the year 887 b. c, so that it
would have retrograded to the 26th of February in
the first year of Nabonassar, or 746 years before the

christian era, and have first coincided with the rising
of Sirius in a. d. 139. That is, however, as already
observed, much too low an estimate of this important
point of egyptian antiquity.
Diodorus3 mentions a golden circle, of three hun
dred and sixty-five cubits in circumference, by a cubit
in breadth, as having been formerly shown in a theban
edifice, among which cubits were distributed the days
of the year, with the proper risings and settings of the
stars attached to each, and their mystical import, ac
cording to the egyptian astrologers. It is not very
easy to say what degree of faith is here due to the de
scription of Diodorus, which he professes to have de
rived from Hecatseus of Abdera, or other greek writ
ers on Egypt of the days of the Ptolemies ; yet, im
mediately afterwards, he informs us that this sphere
was carried off by Cambyses, two hundred years be
fore their time. Admitting, however, the tradition to
be correct, there would be much reason to believe that
the sphere was constructed at the time the new calen
dar was established, as a monument of the institution ;b
certainly, it may be presumed, if Diodorus' account be
correct, not after they had observed the real discre
pancy between the civil and the sidereal year, other
wise it would have been quite vain to have fixed the
risings and settings of the stars, and their prognosti
cations, to particular days of the months, as they must
have known that in a few years the use of their sphere

would have been at an end. The building in which
Diodorus states this golden calendar to have been
placed, seems to have been a monument of the reign
of Sesostris, (first king of the nineteenth dynasty,)
which the historian or his authorities mistook for the
sepulchre of a more ancient king, Osymandyas,0 of
whom there may have been some memorial in the
neighbourhood. The reign of Sesostris, according to
the most moderate estimate of his native historians,
cannot be brought down lower than about the middle
of the fourteenth century b. c. ; but as the egyptian
emperors were much in the habit of adding to, and
embellishing the edifices of their predecessors, and as
this sphere was a mere piece of ornamental furniture,
not necessarily connected with the structure itself, its
existence there might be evidence of its having been
framed at a period posterior to the accession of the
nineteenth dynasty, though it would be none of its
being of equal antiquity with the reign of the sove
reign abovementioned. It might naturally suggest
itself, that a satisfactory mode of deciding the contro
versy respecting the institution of the epagomenae, or
five additional days, would be to ascertain whether,
among the dates which recent discoveries in egyptian
literature enable scholars to interpret from the ancient
records, there be any marked in those days at remote
periods of antiquity. But it is singular enough, that
although a great number of historical dates, both of
the ancient dynasty of the Pharaohs, and of the greek and roman sovereigns have been brought to light,d

in the egyptian language and characters as well as in
greek, yet all, I believe without exception, refer to
days of the months, and not one to the embolic days.
This may be the result of accident, or possibly these
days may have been in a certain degree nefasti, and
hence less likely to occur connected with dates of
civil or religious solemnities ; though I am not aware
that there is any authority to justify such a belief ;
indeed the very constitution of the calendar, which
caused the greater number of feasts to take the days
of the year in succession, seems to render it inadmis
sible ; besides which, royal deaths, births, accessions,
and other public events of an unexpected nature,
whether joyful or calamitous, might require to be re
corded on the epagomense, as well as the days of the
months.
But at whatever epoch the egyptian calendar was
finally established, it is clear that the first notion of
the canicular cycle must date from the subsequent
period, when they had not only experienced how in
correct it still was, but had fixed their error at a
quarter of a day ; and connected the deficiency with
the corresponding excess of the interval between the
heliacal risings of their favorite star, over their civil
year. Having calculated, therefore, that they lost a
day every four revolutions, it was a very simple mat

have, it appears, not hitherto been discovered in the hieroglyphic, or any

most of the other signs for the reckoning of time, such as year, day, the
twelve months, and the numerals from one to a thousand, have been
identified, as might he expected from their nature, with greater facility,
and more mathematical certainty, than almost any other hieroglyphic

ter to regulate a cycle of 1461 of their own years
upon this principle ; for as there are just so many
quarters of a day in the Julian year, at the end of that
period, their Thot, that is the first day of their first
month, must have retrograded through it to the point
from whence it set out.
It is equally clear, that this anticipation of the
seasons having been once so fixed, a cycle of this na
ture could be dated from any given day of any given
year, to a corresponding day after 1 46 1 revolutions ;
from the year, for instance, on which Sirius rose
heliacally on the 'first of the month Phamenoth, as
well as from that on which it rose heliacally on the
first of Thot. Thus the Phoenix, according to some/
was fabled to appear in Egypt at intervals of 1461
years, which might be called the cycle of the Phoenix ;
and in the same way national revolutions, the acces
sion of favorite sovereigns, or other remarkable events,
might in partial chronological systems become the
basis of sothiac cycles. Of this we shall have occa
sion presently to notice an example of considerable
importance to the elucidation of our subject.
With regard to the period, when the discrepancy
between the civil and the tropical year was first ob
served and defined ; it naturally suggests itself, that
the discovery would take place, in consequence of
their having remarked, that the interval between the
heliacal risings of Sirius, which they had assumed as
equal to the solar year, exceeded their own by about
six hours. This, accordingly, has been the opinion
of those who suppose that the new calendar was esta
blished in 1322 b. c., its first day being fixed to that

whereon Sirius rose heliacally ; among others of Professor Ideler ;f who adds, that on account of the
great difficulty of observing with any degree of nicety
in the climate of Egypt the exact days on which the stars were disengaged from the rays of the sun,g a very
considerable time might have elapsed, before they could
have ascertained that Sirius appeared precisely a day
later in their calendar every four years. This same
difficulty has led other experimental astronomers11 to
doubt or to deny, that the true length of the julian
year could have been originally regulated by any re
ference to the phases of the Dogstar at all ; and
rather to suppose that having been calculated by some
other means, such as the observation of the shadow,
or of the points of sunrise, it may afterwards have
been identified with the heliacal year of Sirius. These
are matters which fall within the province of practical
astronomers, and where they differ, the historical
critic cannot pretend to decide. Some authors of
eminence1 have indeed, in the heat of controversy, or
under the influence of system, even gone the length
<of doubting whether the r'irugrov ripigag of excess
had been thus ultimately defined, at the period of
the first familiar acquaintance of the Greeks with
Egypt ; an opinion of which I conceive no person
who takes an impartial view of egyptian antiquity,
will be inclined to approve. Its supporters appeal to

Herodotus, who, it is asserted, is so far from betray
ing any suspicion of the additional quarter of a day
having been known to the Egyptians in his time, that
he commends that people/ because " they first of all
men had discovered the true year, distributing it into
twelve portions according to the seasons ; and in this
respect show themselves so much the wiser than the
Greeks in his opinion, as the Greeks intercalate every
second year, to keep pace with the seasons ; but the
Egyptians, counting twelve months of thirty days
each, add to each year five days extraordinary, and
thus the seasons are kept to their proper places."
Here, as elsewhere, the father of Grecian history does
indeed show how unwise he himself was in these mat
ters, and utters at the same time an unintentional sa
tire upon that wisdom which was the object of his
admiration ; the system he eulogizes being founded
on the very defect which his countrymen took pains
to rectify by their cycles of lunar years. But what
conclusion are we entitled to draw from this respect
ing the astronomical science of the Egyptians ? 1 This,
it is evident, is merely the opinion of Herodotus him
self, who, finding a year of only three hundred and
sixty-five days in civil use among them, which his
profound admiration for their wisdom led him igno
rantly to fancy must be the true length of the solar
revolution, makes his observations accordingly ; af
fording one, among other strong proofs, of his super
ficial acquaintance with several important points of
egyptian custom, on which his authority is so often
and confidently appealed to by modern critics. The
priests may surely have admitted the extra six hours

into their astronomical computation in the days of
Herodotus, although they were not at pains to com
municate their knowledge to that curious though sim
ple inquirer, of whose honest credulity they seem not
unfrequently to have made a jest."1 It is however
added, that Thales, who visited Egypt several gene
rations prior to Herodotus, and was admitted to a
participation of the mysteries of the learned men of
that country, obtained from them no nearer approxi
mation to the true time than his countryman. Our
acquaintance with the philosophy of Thales is by far
too vague and imperfect, to justify any positive infer
ence respecting his doctrines, either moral or physi
cal, much less with regard to those borrowed by him
from Egypt. But under any circumstances, if we ad
mit that the year of 365 days was established in that
country, as there can be no reasonable doubt it was,
many centuries before the days of either of the Greek
sages above mentioned, it were hardly credible that a
people in the habit of observing the heavens, as the
Egyptians unquestionably did with some attention, if
not with very excellent instruments, and among
whom, from the very nature of their climate, the cal
culation of the returns of the seasons was a matter of
considerable importance, and at the same time of

pool between two lofty peaks at Syene ; whence issuing, its waters were
divided, part flowing to the north, part to the south, (L. ii. § 28.) ; also

greater facility than in most other countries,—it is
hardly credible that such a people should have been
so stupid as not to have perceived, that in a hundred
and twenty years the periodical returns of seed-time
and harvest, of the rise and fall of their river, of the
risings and settings of their favourite stars, had al
tered their positions in the calendar by about a month ;
and if so, it required no very profound astronomical
science to fix the excess of the tropical year in round
numbers at a quarter of a day. If their astronomers
had not made this discovery before the days of Hero
dotus, we must altogether deny them the merit of
ever having made it at all ; for it is not to be sup
posed, that amid the anarchy, oppression, and national
distress, which followed the Persian conquest, the de
graded priesthood should in a few years have advanced
more rapidly in astronomical discovery, than during
ten centuries of the more brilliant ages of national
prosperity and independence. We should therefore
be reduced to the necessity of supposing, that they
acquired their knowledge of the Julian year from the
Greeks ; which is as inconsistent with probability, as
with the unanimous testimony of the Greeks them
selves."
The silence however of the travellers of this last
mentioned nation on these points, though not suffi
cient to justify so low an estimate of egyptian learn
ing, is certainly somewhat surprising. Plato and

made acquainted by the theban priests with the addi
tional quarter of a day ; but amid the multitude of
learned and inquisitive men who are said to have de
voted so much attention and so many years' study to
egyptian history, it is remarkable that no notice should
be taken of its application to the cycle prior to the
days of Manetho ;p and this, added to the meagerness
of the allusions to the cycle itself, contained in his
works, as well as in those of other native annalists,
must be considered as strong proof how recent and
imperfect its use really was in their chronology.
It would be quite superfluous, after what has been
already observed, to enter upon any lengthened ar
gument to show, that this celebrated sothiac period,
at whatever epoch the first notion of it may have oc
curred, need be considered, in its application to remote
ages, as nothing more than a matter of calculation,
resembling the julian period of Scaliger, or other si
milar chronological fictions. This is indeed self
evident, and has been so fully explained and illustrated
by various authors, more especially by M. Biot in his
valuable Researches on several points, of Egyptian
astronomy, that it will be sufficient to refer the reader
who may be curious to inquire farther to his work,
where the subject has been exhausted in a section ex
pressly devoted to its investigation.q It may therefore
safely be asserted, that it were as unreasonable to as
sume, that because in a system of chronology the date
of some event of remote antiquity is assigned to such
or such a year of this cycle, the knowledge of the cy
cle itself must necessarily have existed in Egypt at

the same period, as it would be to assert, that the
julian year was used by the Greeks on the first esta
blishment of the olympiads, because that event, in our
chronology, is assigned to a certain year of the julian
period. It is surprising, however, to what an extent
this error has prevailed among authors who ought to have known better : thus Freret,r and after him
Bailly,8 have assumed the knowledge of this mode of
reckoning among the Egyptians, in the year 2782
B. c, merely on account of an apparent allusion by
Manetho to a vague date of his native history, given
as they supposed in years of the cycle terminating in
1322, and which ought therefore to have commenced
in 2782. And Bailly has gone the still greater
length of inferring, that the year of 365? days was
known to the Egyptians at that remote period. Had
Manetho, as he might accidentally have done, ascribed
to some still more ancient event of his fabulous his
tory its date in years of a former cycle, it would, upon
this principle, be equally incumbent on us to admit
the knowledge of the solar year in 4242 b. c, and so
on ad infinitum, or at least up to a period of near
37000 years before our Saviour ; for it will be seen
presently, that the native historians claimed twenty
five such cycles for the fabulous duration of their em
pire, counted back from the year 350 b. c, the actual
existence and use of which among the antediluvian,
or rather antemundane Egyptians, must also be ad
mitted upon the premises of the above mentioned
authors. Sir Isaac Newton1 having, in his Chrono

about the 900 b. c, Freret," in his confutation of that
system, advanced as proof of the prior existence of the
egyptian year certain passages of Manetho, and other
historians of the age of the Ptolemies, where dates of
remote events are assigned in years of the cycle ; in
ferring, as a necessary consequence, the existence in
those days of the form of year of which the cycle was
composed. Newton did not condescend to enter
upon a serious exposure of this sophistry, but merely
observed, that his critic had misunderstood him, as
his argument referred merely to the egyptian year, and had nothing to do with the cycle.v This answer
his antagonist himself quotes, somewhat piqued," and
in his reply formally states, that he is unable to com
prehend how Newton distinguished between the egyp
tian year and the cycle composed of that year, or
how the one could exist without the other. The
learned academician might as well have said, that he
was unable to comprehend how .barbarians could rec
kon time by days and nights without the knowledge
of the julian year ; or how Julius Csesar could have
established his calendar, without being acquainted
with the julian period. It is surprising that so acute
a genius as Freret unquestionably was, should have
been so blinded by the effect of prejudice or system,
as thus to have persisted in that very sophistry him
self which he saw and pointed out so acutely and
convincingly in others.

28 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
A still farther illustration we have of the influence
on historical criticism, of this error of assuming dates
of calculation for epochs of contemporary observation
or record, in its application to the celebrated aera of
Nabonassar, which falls to be noticed here, as having
been, from certain circumstances, closely connected
and mixed up with the chronology of Egypt. This
was a chaldee period, commencing in 747 b. c., dated,
as is usually supposed, from the accession of a Meso
potamiam prince of the name of Nabonassar ; and the
greek astronomers, Hipparchus, and after him Pto
lemy, having adopted the celestial observations of the
Chaldees by preference, as the basis of their own as
tronomical systems, assumed this aera as the limit,
within which such of those observations as they con
sidered worthy of their attention were comprised.
But finding it convenient, according to their own
principle of computation, to reduce the babylonian
reckoning of time, in. common with that of all other
states to whose scientific records they had occasion to
appeal, into the year in civil use in Alexandria, (at
that time the chief seat of learning,) which, from its
familiarity and great convenience, they had adopted
as a standard—we have thus in their works a series of
egyptian years, dating from the twenty-sixth of Feb
ruary 747 b. c., (on which day the moveable Thot
fell at that epoch), called the aera of Nabonassar ; and
hence modern chronologers have been misled, as
above stated, to assume, some1 that the Chaldees had
adopted the use of the solar years of 365 days from
the Egyptians at that period ; cthersy that this is

merely an egyptian sera, but dated from a conquest of
the country by Nabonassar the Assyrian ; and Dod
well2 and others, as already observed, have even gone
the length of supposing that the year of 365 days was
originally an invention of the Chaldees, first intro
duced into Egypt by the Persian conquerors. All
which opinions are equally unsupported by any au
thority but the conjecture of their supporters, as has
been pointed out by Petavius," and still more fully and satisfactorily by Freretb and Jackson.0
The sothiac cycle being therefore, like the julian
period, or the egyptian year of Nabonassar, merely
proleptic, the dates of remote events of egyptian his
tory recorded in years of that cycle, putting the gene
ral fabulousness of the early annals of the nation out
of the question, can be in themselves no better than
any others ; as not being necessarily, nor probably,
connected with any observation made at the time it
self. Had the cycle been known at the period of the
expulsion of the Shepherds, and the accession of
Amosis ; and this important epoch of the national
history been so noted at the time in the sacerdotal
records ; and established as it were on an astronomi
cal basis, according to actual observation of Sirius ;
there could hardly have been any dispute among those
who afterwards compiled the same records, with re
gard to so positive and standard a point of chronology ;
and consequently the wide discrepancy which we find
between the statements of Ptolemy the Mendesian

of the Old Chronicle—and those of Josephus, Afri
canus, and Eusebius, each professing to be derived
from Manetho—could never have existed. This date
therefore, of three hundred and forty-five years before
the lapse of the cycle, can merely give us to under
stand, that according to Ptolemy'* view of the egyptian
annals, the expulsion of the Shepherds took place as
many years before his own time, as were contained
in the intervening period ; or about the 1668 b. c.
according to our reckoning ; and may have been a
computation* made by himself, from observation of
the place in the tropical year which the Thot occu
pied, as compared with the day of the egyptian year
on which Sirius rose heliacally, at the epoch when he
himself wrote. Had the Old Chronicle fixed the
date of this event in years of the cycle, it would have
placed it in the four hundred and twenty-sixth year
before its lapse ; Manetho, taking his numbers accord
ing to Africanus, would nearly have coincided with
Ptolemy ; according to Eusebius he would have fixed
it four hundred and three years before its lapse ; and
according to Josephus would probably have differed
from all the others.
There can1 be no doubt but that chronological
tables, formed upon this cycle on the principle of
calculation above alluded to, would have been found
by the egyptian annalists a very convenient and use
ful method of establishing the relative dates of re
markable events ; some sort of standard sera or period
of this kind being a desideratum in the annals of every
nation, more especially when of so great extent and
antiquity as those of Egypt. But there are various
•i See Append. No. VII.



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. I. 31
circumstances which tend to show that this mode of
calculation, as here described, never was in familiar
use among the chronologers of that country. First,
the extreme paucity, or rather total want of dates so
recorded ; that of Ptolemy or Clemens above quoted,
being, as we shall .see, the only palpable one upon
record, as far at least as my researches go. Secondly,
that although among the native historians of the age
of the Ptolemies, mention occurs of a period of 1461
years as a measure of their annals, real or fabulous, the
cycle which they used seems to have been very differ
ently regulated from that concerning which we have
hitherto been inquiring ; for the Old Chronicle already
quoted, makes the egyptian empire last twenty-five
cycles, containing 36525 years, and terminating with
Nectanebo their last native monarch ; whose attempt
to re-establish the independence of his country was
crushed by Darius Ochus in the year 350 b. c. These
cycles therefore differed in their periods by upwards
of four hundred and eighty years, from those which
terminated in 1322 b. c. and a. d. 139. I have
formerly had occasion to observe,8 on the authority
of Africanus and Syncellus, that there is much reason
to believe, that, on this point, Manetho and the na
tive annalists in general, followed the same method
of computation as the Old Chronicle ; and that opin
ion has been since confirmed by a passage of Jam
blichus/ who expressly states, that according to Ma
netho, Mercury (or Thot) had illustrated the sacred
history of Egypt in 36525 volumes ; which, as Gale
justly observes in his note to the passage/ can refer

32 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
to nothing else than the fabulous 36525 years, or
twenty-five cycles of duration, assigned to this empire.
All this is sufficient proof that the historical cycle
commonly used by the egyptian annalists differed from
the astronomical cycle, regulated by the coincidence
of the Thot with the heliacal rising of Sirius. It is however evident, as has been shown by Bainbridge,h
Ideler,1 and by myself elsewhere," from the general
tenor of their records, and the comparative chrono
logy of other nations, that the date preserved by
Clemens Alexandrinus is given in years of the cycle
terminating in 1322 b. c. That this date is borrowed
by him from the pagan historian Ptolemy, to whom
he appeals as to the best authority, there can be little
doubt ; as the method of computation itself, limited as
it is among the egyptian annalists, was yet peculiar to
them. The only occasion where the name of Manetho
occurs connected with a date of this nature, is a pas
sage of Syncellus ;1 which some have interpreted as
stating, that Manetho had placed the occupation of
Egypt by the Shepherds in the seven hundredth year
of a canicular cycle. Of this, however, as the text of
Syncellus is now read, no sense whatever can be
made ; and unless we suppose either that the passage
is corrupt, or that Syncellus himself has misquoted or
misunderstood Manetho, we must admit that Manetho
computed his cycles in a manner different from any hitherto mentioned.m For as the seven hundredth

year spoken of by Syncellus in connexion with the cycle
of Manetho, is also, according to the same christian
chronologer, the seven hundredth year after the disper
sion of Babel, and as the dispersion of Babel is placed
by him in the year 2724 b. c., the cycle itself would
have terminated in 1264 b. c. ; which would harmo
nize with no method of computation hitherto deve
loped. Although Marsham" has clearly pointed out
this discrepancy, yet Freret,0 and after him Champol
lion Figeac,p have founded their respective systems
of egyptian chronology upon the basis of the date of
Syncellus, as alluding to seven hundred years of a
cycle terminating in 1322 ; and Pezronq has also ad
mitted it into his calculations, but on the supposition
that it referred, in a confused sort of way, to the cycle
of the Old Chronicle ; which suited his views better.
The results of their respective theories are as incon
gruous and unsatisfactory, as might be expected from
the common error on which they are founded. What
is perhaps still less excusable, Bailly has, with other
critical fallacies of Freret, adopted also this imaginary
date, and assigned it considerable importance in his
history of ancient astronomy/
dynasties ; where the principal misinterpretations to which it has been
subjected have been pointed out.

$4 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
SECTION II.
CONCERNING THE TWELVE EGYPTIAN CALENDAR
MONTHS, AND THE TWELVE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC.
ANALYSIS OF THEIR ORIGINAL POSITIONS WITH RE
SPECT TO THE SEA80NS, AND TO EACH OTHER.
Having thus examined, in as far as our scanty mate
rials will permit, the true nature and history of the
canicular cycle, and of the form of year on which it
was grounded, we shall now proceed to inquire more
minutely into the origin, and primitive arrangement
with respect to the seasons, of the egyptian calendar
itself ; that is to say, of the twelve months which con
stituted the elements of that year and cycle. The in
vestigation of these matters will, besides its own im
mediate results, also tend naturally to throw addi
tional light on others previously treated of. And on
entering upon this obscure and difficult portion of our
subject, I shall at once lay distinctly and concisely be
fore the reader the basis, and at the same time the
summary, of those researches to which the remainder
of this essay will be devoted, by observing : that a
careful examination of the names and hieroglyphical
emblems of the twelve egyptian months, as referred
to the twelve corresponding seasons of the climate of
the banks of the Nile, and illustrated by the general
details of egyptian tradition and mythology, have led



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. II. 35
me to infer: First, that these emblems were originally
adapted to a year, whose Thot, or first day, was fixed
about the autumnal equinox ; Secondly, that on the
basis of such a year, there exists between the names
and characters of the months, and the signs of the
zodiac considered as mythological symbols or hiero
glyphics, so close a correspondence and analogy, as
not only affords additional proof of the correctness of
this basis, but tends to explain and elucidate, in a new
and unexpected manner, that great mystery, the ori
gin and primitive use of the zodiac itself.
I am well aware how very strong, and indeed rea
sonable, an inclination there may be, to consider dis
cussions of this kind as useless or visionary, and more
especially all speculations connected with the history
of the zodiac,—a name which, considering the extra
vagancies into which this subject has led many learned
and ingenious persons during the last thirty years,
might be supposed sufficient in itself to call forth a
blush on the cheek of every egyptian antiquary, for
the errors of his brethren, if not for his own. Con
vinced, however, of the reasonableness, I will not say
the conclusiveness, of the system which I am about to
propose, I shall not be deterred by any such consider
ations from offering those remarks which may, I con
ceive, whether correct or erroneous, be calculated ei
ther in themselves to throw light on an obscure point
of antiquity, or lead to farther inquiries illustrative
thereof.
It will readily be admitted, that any people, in
whatever state of barbarism or civilization they may
be supposed, who established a form of year, divided
into twelve months, according to the seasons, must
have intended that its revolution should bring about,



36 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
more or less accurately, the returns of those seasons
to the corresponding months. Some, when they dis
covered that their computation was defective, may
have been willing, from indifference, superstition, or
other causes, to submit to the inconvenience of a mut
able year, while others were careful, by occasional
correction or intercalation, to keep its commencement
more or less steady to its original point ; but none
could have meant to establish, in the first instance, as
a positive institution, so very useless or even perni
cious an irregularity. That the Egyptians, at least,
had no such intention, we appear to have convincing
proof in the hieroglyphic signs of their months, em
blems handed down from very remote antiquity, hav
ing been observed in dates of records, which may rea
sonably be assigned to a period not less than fifteen
hundred years prior to the christian era, as has been
shown in a satisfactory manner by M. Champollion
the younger, in his letters on the museum of Turin."
These emblems I have caused to be engraved, for the
convenience of reference," and in order that the reader
may judge for himself, how far I am justified in sup
posing that they represent the portion of the year to
which I am about to assign them.
The characters here given are borrowed from the
work of Professor Kosegarten0 on the ancient language

and literature of Egypt, being derived originally from
the papyri of the museum of Turin ; and many of
them may be seen in the plates to the letters on that
museum/ above mentioned, occupying their places in
the dates of the hieroglyphic inscriptions, which form
the material of those learned and ingenious illustra
tions. I have seen another set of similar characters
compiled by some of our own countrymen, in the
course of their researches in Egypt, and forming part
of a valuable collection of hieroglyphic and other re
mains, engraved in lithography at Cairo.6 The sym
bols of the months are, with little variety, the same,
to all essential purposes, as far as our present inquiry
is concerned, in both collections ; but I have pre
ferred those of Professor Kosegarten, as well from
their indisputable antiquity as from their greater sim
plicity. The principal variations in the other set are,
first, a sign of water or moisture under the numeral
of each month, possibly an emblem of the general in
fluence which the phenomena of the Nile exercised on
the regulation of the calendar, as on most other na
tional institutions of the Egyptians ; and, secondly,
that the idea month is designated by a star, in addi
tion to the more familiar and ancient emblem, the in
verted half-moon. We shall have occasion farther to
notice this last peculiarity in a subsequent page.
The year, it will be observed by a reference to the
plate, is divided into three portions, each containing
four months ; which arrangement corresponds to the
statement of Diodorus,f that the Egyptians acknow
ledged but three seasons, spring, summer, and autumn,

and may be the foundation of the tradition mentioned
by that author, and familiar among the ancients,8 that
their year itself formerly consisted of only four months.
The notion, however, that such a computation ever
was in actual use, though admitted by many chrono
logers, in common with years of one, two, and three
months, for the accommodation of fanciful systems,
appears destitute of historical proof, as well as of rea
sonable probability.
The first four months, or the first season, Thot,
Paophi, Athyr, Choiak, are represented, first, by the
common sign of month, an inverted half moon ; se
condly, by the peculiarly characteristic sign of the
season, a group of lotus flowers and buds, symbols of
vegetation familiar to those conversant in hierogly phic lore,h but more especially of the fresh and vigor
ous vegetation caused by the fertilizing influence of
the waters of the Nile ; thirdly, by their respective
numbers, I, II, III, IV. The emblems of these four
months denote therefore the season commencing with
the first subsiding of the inundation, when the egyp
tian plain burst forth, as it was gradually uncovered
by the waters, into the most brilliant verdure ; partly

evidently but an abbreviated variety of the group of water-plants, the
symbol of the lower region, that is, of lower Egypt, so remarkable for
that species of vegetation. (vid. Champol. Pantheon. pl. 7. A. 7. B.) So
that the word ITf API, the egyptian generic name for water-plants, would
perhaps furnish a more appropriate derivation. (vid. Rossi. Etym. Copt.
and Croze. Lexic. aegypt. in voce).



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. II. 39
natural, arising from the spring of the lotus, and the
multitude of other plants, as well aquatic as of spon
taneous growth, for which Egypt was so celebrated
that Pliny, supported by Herodotus,1 asserts they
would almost suffice for the subsistence of the inha
bitants, without toil or tillage of any kind ; partly
if one may be allowed to use such a term—artificial ;
for the sowing commenced as the flood subsided, and
the young blade, during this season, rapidly springing
up, contributed still more to deck the fertile plain
with luxuriant green. These four months, therefore,
have been not inappropriately named in the Cairo
collection, the season of water plants.
Of the next four, Tobi, Mechir, Phamenoth, Phar
mouthi, the precise sense of the symbol is not so ob
vious. The hieroglyphic legend, read phonetically,
gives us Er- or Hir, or H-r-t ; which syllables, Cham
pollion, from the analogy of the Rosetta inscription,
interprets, though on somewhat questionable grounds,11
" brilliant or resplendent." Admitting, however,
the correctness of the rendering, it would be difficult
to see the propriety of the application of this epithet
to the four months in question, which from their po
sition must have been the season of drought and ari
dity, without being that in which the sun was at his
greatest height and brilliancy. In the Cairo collec
tion they are called the season of ploughing ; but I
question whether there be sufficient authority, from
the history of ancient egyptian husbandry, to justify
such a description. The season of harvest would, I
conceive, be a more appropriate appellation, for rea

sons which shall be given when we come to examine
the months in detail. The position, however, which
these four occupy, renders the sense of their hiero
glyphic name of less importance ; since the characters
of those which precede, and of those which follow
them, sufficiently vouch for their own.
The four last, Pachon, Paoni, Epiphi, Mesori, are
rightly named in the work just quoted, the season of
waters ; that is, of the increase or overflow of the
Nile, as expressed by the hieroglyphic of water, and
more especially of the water of the Nile, thrice re
peated, and forming the most important feature of the
group. This emblem is almost too well known, and
its sense too obvious, to require much comment ;
being one of the most common and familiar, and oc
curring constantly, not only as the hieroglyphic. sign,
but as the picture as it were of water. Thus, in a
scene given in the Cairo collection,1 where a body of
prisoners is led across a river, probably the Nile, or
one of its branches, the water is represented by a
number of these zigzags, among which are also drawn
fish, and round their edges leaves, denoting the water
plants on its banks. The boats in the river scene of
the grotto of Elithya are also drawn on a similar
ground. The same figure is applied to the pouring
of water, the fluid being represented by a zigzag line
issuing from a vase ; and is also the sign Aquarius of
the zodiak.
Professor Ideler, in allusion to certain passages of
the ancients above quoted, concerning the ancient
subdivision of the egyptian year, while yet unac
quainted with the discoveries on which the present
1 Mater. hierogl. pl. xxxvi.



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. II- 41
observations are grounded, expresses himself as fol lows :m " It is very probable that the Egyptians, on
the first establishment of their solar year, subdivided
it into periods of four months, as nature herself sub
divides the seasons in their climate in a similar man
ner ; namely, into the period of the inundation, that
of the bursting vegetation, and that of dry and un
wholesome heat." This is so apt and true a descrip
tion of what has since turned out to be the fact, that
one might almost have supposed, that instead of being
merely an ingenious conjecture, it had been written
as a commentary on the hieroglyphic calendar itself.
On the supposition, then, that these emblems de
note the peculiar character of the respective seasons
or months, as originally fixed in the primitive egyp
tian calendar ; it remains, before we can be led to any
further conclusions, to assign these months their pro
per position in the solar or tropical year, correspond
ing to their characters. And here we can have little
hesitation in fixing the commencement of the first
month to the autumnal equinox ; as well from the
probability that the Egyptians, in common with other
neighbouring nations, in the early ages of their his
tory, really did so reckon, as shall be seen,—as from
the fact, that at this period precisely, with the subsid
ing of the inundation, commenced that luxuriant
growth of water-plants, and that florid vegetation in
dicated by the hieroglyphic of the season. " The
lotus," says Pliny," " springs up as the waters of the
Nile begin to subside ; its stalk and luxuriant leaves
not unlike those of a bean, but shorter and more

slender, crowned with a flower like a poppy." This
last is a tolerably accurate description of the flower of
the symbol, as represented in the more finished hier
oglyphic texts. To the above we may add the ele
gant description of the same phenomenon by our own
geographer Pinkerton :° " The lotus is a species of
nymphaea or water lily, which at the retreat of the
inundation covers all the canals and shallow pools
with its broad round leaves, among which are its
cup-shaped blossoms of pure white and cerulean blue,
reposing with inimitable grace on the surface of the water." And the French memorialists remark,p that
at this period the Nile rapidly retiring, " the earth is
all of a sudden covered with abundant vegetation."
With respect to the remaining months, and the gene
ral rapidity of growth of all kinds which is the cha
racter of the season, Maillet4 observes, that " during
November, December and January, the vegetation is
so powerful, that an ox reposing on the grass would
find sufficient pasture for a day by browsing around
him without rising from his place." This first season
therefore comprehends the four months dated from
the end of our September, during which the sun tra
verses the signs of Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, and Ca
pricorn. The next season, the four months of
drought, from the end of January to the end of May ;
and the season of water, or of the increase of the
Nile, the remaining four, from the end of May to the
end of September. It might perhaps be objected,

that the swell of the river does not begin until about
the summer solstice, towards the end of June ; and
there is no doubt but that the greater number of au
thors, both ancient and modern, are used to date the
augmentation of its waters in general terms from
that epoch. But that this must be understood,
not of the first perceptible influence of the rains
of Ethiopia upon its stream, but either of the pe
riod when it became so visibly affected as to ex
cite the attention of the vulgar, or when the first
observation of the increase was made on the nilo
meter, and promulgated to the public, may be pre
sumed, as well from the testimony of those travellers
who have had the best opportunities of judging, as
from the ascertained facts respecting the fall of the
periodical rains, which commence when the sun is
perpendicular to the climate of Abyssinia, about a
month after the equinox, and constantly increasing,
produce a perceptible alteration in the waters of the
river about the end of May or the beginning of June/
The statements of egyptian travellers on this point
are so various as almost to be contradictory, some
placing the first visible increase at the solstice, others
a month before, others not for some days afterwards ;
which discrepancy must be accounted for by the fact,
admitted by intelligent observers, that the phenome
non itself is not strictly regular in its periodical re
turns. The following is the account of Maillet,5 whose
opinion, from his long residence in the country, added
to his general good sense and accuracy, is deserving
of greater attention than that of the mere occasional

and hasty traveller, who must necessarily be a partial
and superficial observer. He remarks, that though
some asserted that the river began to increase as soon
as the sun had crossed the line, no such augmentation
was perceptible, and that, in general, there can hardly
be said to be any difference until the last days of April
or the beginning of May. The waters first become
muddy, and then increase, but so slowly, that, during
a considerable part of the month of June, there is
hardly a cubit of rise ; but that, about the solstice,
it is already very considerable. And, in conformity
with the above, in his account of the nilometer or
mikias,' he states, that the first examination takes
place about the end of April, the second about the
end of June, at which time the Nile has risen eight
or nine cubits, and adds, that it was a wise regulation
to place the first announcement of the increase of the
waters at this advanced season, in order to spare the
people anxiety concerning their progress. This may
account for the circumstance that so many authors,
without inquiring into details, assign the solstice, in
round terms, as the fixed date of the commencement
of the inundation. The testimony of Maillet is sup
ported by several others of the most respectable writ
ers on Egypt, and the minutest observers of the phy
sical peculiarities of its climate. " The river Nile,"
says Thevenot," " begins commonly to swell in the
month of May, and on St. Peter's day, the 28th of
June, they begin to cry about the streets how much
its waters have risen." " In the first days of June," says Savary,T " the Nile begins to increase, but the

.OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. II. 45
augmentation first becomes remarkable about the sum
mer solstice." Shaw," too, states, that, in the middle
of June, in his time, the waters had risen very consi
derably.
It will farther be observed, that the hieroglyphic of
water attached to the third season is to be considered
as denoting, not so much the inundation itself, as the
space between the first perceptible rise of the river
and the period when its waters began again to de
crease ; first, because the actual overflow of the Nile
scarcely lasts three months, commencing at soonest in
the middle of July, and terminating suddenly in the
beginning of October ; secondly, because the season
of vegetation, or of water plants, setting in at once
with the subsiding of the flood, (as illustrated by the
above passages of Pliny, and other authors, collated
with the hieroglyphic of the first four months,) can
not admit of the new year's day being fixed at any
other epoch than the equinox of autumn, or towards
the end of our September, when the Nile, according
to the unanimous testimony of both geographers and
travellers, regularly begins to uncover the land, its
stagnating waters to send forth their luxuriant growth,
and the whole face of nature is renewed ; all which
coincidences combined formed an epoch which could
hardly fail to present itself to the first simple framers
of a calendar in this climate, as the natural and ob

the Nile does, in fact, begin to alter its appearance,
almost invariably, many days before the solstice, it re

the quadrimestrial partition of the year, the month

preceding that epoch must necessarily be the first of
the season of waters, or of the rise of the river. But,
besides this, although we certainly have the statements
of many respectable authorities among the Greeks,
that they themselves were the first to discover the
true cause of the inundation of the river, I confess I
am unable to look upon the opinion, that the Egypt
ians, during the flourishing ages of their empire, were
totally unacquainted with this important point of the
natural history of their own country, in any other
light than as an egregious paradox. There can be no
doubt but that the Egyptians and the Ethiopians of
the upper Nile were a people of the same origin and
of similar manners, and in habits of frequent commu
nication, both civil and military, with each other ; so
that the report of a single traveller, or emancipated
prisoner of war, would have sufficed to establish the
truth. And if we admit, what has long been the ge
neral opinion of the learned, that Abyssinia is the pa
rent land of the Mizraimite race,1 the notion that the
Egyptians should, in the infancy of their civil institu
tions, and for some thousand years afterwards, never
have had a tradition of the periodical rains which
swelled their river, becomes quite inadmissible. Here,
as usual, Herodotus is appealed to, whose testimony
I reject at once, as the priests most unquestionably
made game of him in their answers to his inquiries
respecting the Nile. The next authorities are Eu
doxus and Plato. These two distinguished men vi
sited Egypt about the same time, and have transmitted

two different, though apparently perfectly correct, ac
counts of the real opinions of the priesthood concern
ing the phenomena of their river, and which are also
jointly stated and confirmed by Horapollo. That of
Plato shall be mentioned in another place. But Eu
doxusy was informed that the inundation was caused
by the periodical fall of the tropical rains. Now, as
they must have known that these rains, falling with
greatest violence during the months of May and June,
were immediately followed by the at first almost im
perceptible alteration of the state of the river, they
would find it the more reasonable to comprehend the
month immediately preceding the solstice in the sea
son of waters, although the visible rise of the river
might not commence until nearly the solstice itself.
The hieroglyphical seasons may therefore be distri
buted, as to their more immediate reference to the
phenomena of the Nile itself, which influenced all the
institutions of this country, into four months of the
rise, four months of the fall, and four months of the
lowest or stationary condition of its waters. Lest,
however, it should be thought that too much reliance
has here been placed on conjecture, and too little on
ancient authority, I shall produce very convincing and
satisfactory testimony to prove that this division of the
seasons is as conformable to the familiar opinion of
antiquity as to the truth. The following is the result
of the investigations of Aristides, who states that he

had traversed Egypt four times, as far as Ethiopia, for
the express purpose of examining the peculiarities of
the Nile. " When the proper season arrives," says
he,* " the river begins to increase, but so slowly, that
at first the augmentation is not perceptible, but, set
ting out with a few inches, it gradually gains force,
so that in about four months the waters reach their
greatest height at Memphis." " They subside in a
similar manner, and require about as long to return
to their pristine state as they did to reach their full
. height."" Precisely the same account is given by Se
neca : " Nilus per quatuor menses liquitur, et illi
sequalis accessio est,"—" The Nile subsides during
four months, and the increase of its waters occupies
an equal time ;" all this too agrees exactly with the
distribution of the egyptian year by Diodorus, as
above mentioned, into three seasons ; spring, summer,
and autumn—winter being omitted altogether, and
justly, as there is in fact no such season in Egypt.
The arrangement that would appear most natural in
the opinion of a Greek, would probably be February,
March, April, May, for spring ; June, July, August,
September, for summer ; October, November, De
cember, January, for autumn ; but it is to be supposed
that the Egyptians, in conformity with the peculiarities
of their climate, reversed this order ; the four last
mentioned months, the first of their calendar, being
in fact their season of spring, seed-time, and opening
vegetation.
Now the symbols which we have just been ex
amining, being peculiarly figurative of certain seasons,

it results indisputably, that it could not be the inten
tion of the Egyptians when they invented them, that
the months whose names they represented should
shift their places in the year ; no nation could have
been willfully guilty of such an absurdity. It is
equally plain, that the year to which they were origi
nally adapted, commenced, not with the heliacal rising
of Sirius, and the overflow of the Nile, as some sup
pose was the case on the first establishment of the
calendar/ but with the subsiding of the waters about
the autumnal equinox. Nor is this view of the primi
tive arrangement of the Calendar of the Egyptians
by any means new ; several distinguished writers have
been of opinion, that their ancient year began in
autumn ; among whom it were sufficient to mention
Calmet, Jackson, and Playfair/ None of these how
ever state their reasons in detail. But the celebrated
Zoega, who, in profoundness of learning and acute
ness of conception, is second to no egyptian antiquary,
not only was convinced, but had actually, as he him
self informs us, composed a dissertation to prove that
the Thot or commencement of the year, in its original
form, was fixed precisely as I have stated it ; that is,
" ab incipiente retrocessu Nili," " from the first sub
siding of the inundation of the river."6 His reasons
for holding this opinion he also does not give at length,

collateral points of egyptian chronology, as stated in
the passage referred to, are far from correct ; indeed,
his own diffidence of their soundness, as he himself
informs us, prevented him from publishing his essay ;
there are however various circumstances, as shall be
observed in another place, which lead to a belief that
some of the arguments which have been, or shall be,
here offered in support of this opinion, were among
those which induced him to adopt it ; but owing to
the comparatively backward state of this department
of antiquarian science in his time, many others of a
more forcible nature could not have occurred to him.
It will now be necessary to turn our attention to
another essential portion of our subject, the history
of the egyptian zodiac. We shall first have occasion
to inquire generally into the real nature and origin of
that institution, and its primitive connexion with the
civil reckoning of time ; and afterwards endeavour
to illustrate both conjointly, by pointing out the re
markable correspondence and analogy which exists
between the signs of the astronomical, and the months
and seasons of the civil calendar, on the basis of the
positions already laid down, with reference to the
traditional mythology, and ancient language and no
menclature of the country.
It is, I believe, universally admitted to be an erro
neous opinion that the twelve positions of the celestial
zone called the zodiack, were originally divided, or
received their names, in consequence of certain groups
of stars which it traverses, being supposed really to
resemble in their form or disposition, the figures of
human or brute creatures, monsters, or other objects.
Such resemblances may have been imagined in later
times, and adapted to the ancient names of the signs



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. II. 51
by fanciful astrologers ; who, in the delineation of a
sphere, naturally endeavoured, though unsuccessfully
enough, to group the stars in the neighbourhood of
the ecliptic, into constellations corresponding in their
forms to the physical emblems, whose names were
attached to certain portions of that circle. But those
visionary images can, and ought to be, no guide to
us in our researches into the real history of the signs
or symbols which represented the twelve divisions of
the sun's annual course in the heavens ; or into the
origin of their various appellations.
The Egyptians or any other nation, who instituted,
in the infancy of their civilization, an imperfect year
of twelve months, supposing that the revolution of
the seasons would be completed during their course,
would naturally, as they advanced in science, divide
the heavens also into the twelve portions, which the
sun was supposed to occupy during each of those
months respectively ; and both the names of their
months, and of the corresponding divisions of the
sphere would be connected with their mythology, and
the titles or attributes of the various deities whose
celestial emblems they may have discovered in par
ticular points of the heaven, or seasons of the year,
or to whom certain stars or seasons were especially
dedicated. Such an institution seems to have been
common, under certain varieties, to almost all the
ancient nations, Chaldees/ Egyptians, Chinese, or
others, who made any progress in astrological science ;
and might have suggested itself to each separately,
without any immediate connexion with their neigh

hours, from its obvious correspondence to the twelve
months and three hundred and sixty days, into which
the same tribes seem originally to have agreed in
dividing their year. Yet the zodiac of the western
nations/ to which alone our present observations are
confined, affords even in its present form the strongest
internal evidence, that though corrupted or altered,
as it is admitted to have been to a certain extent in
passing through the hands of the Greeks, it is origi
nally an egyptian invention ; as well from the pecu
liar turn of that people, to represent by material
emblems every thing capable of being so represented,
as from the palpable connexion of some of these
emblems with their figurative mythology. Each sign
of the zodiac, therefore, appears to have been a mere
hieroglyphic of the season of the year to which it
corresponded, or of the deity to whom that season
was specially sacred. This has been well pointed out by Warburtonh and others, and is indeed very gener
ally admitted, though the efforts made since the days
of Macrobius1 up to the present century, to analyze
more closely the origin of the institution itself, by a
reference to the climate or mythology of the banks
of the Nile, having been directed upon false principles,
have not been successful.11 The hieroglyphical zodiac

therefore, represented the seasons mythologically or
figuratively, and had no connexion with imaginary
forms or creatures in the heaven itself.1 All this will
be put in a more clear point of view, when we come to
trace the correspondence between the signs and the
names and characters of the twelve months, according
to the position they occupied in the civil year at its
first establishment. Thus Cancer or the Scarabee re
presented the solstitial month of summer, that is the
sun when highest in the heaven, and his heat and in
fluence most felt ; Libra the month of the autumnal
equinox, Aries that of the vernal equinox, and so of
the rest ; afterwards, when the signs were attached
by the Greeks to particular groups of stars, embodied
into fantastical forms, the ancient terms became un
meaning, and the origin and history of the whole
system was confounded and obscured.
That the twelve divisions of the zodiac, among the
ancient nations, (whether chaldee or egyptian,) with
on the supposition of an ancient connexion between the forms and sym
bolic significations of the signs, and the sense of the names of the Coptic
or ancient egyptian months. Thus far our two systems agree ; but they
differ in this, that the memorialist adopted as the groundwork of his, first
that the egyptian zodiac was constructed 15000 years ago, about 8000
before the creation, on a moderate computation ; the sign Capricorn which
is now January, then representing July, Cancer corresponding to Capri
corn, and so of the rest ; 2dly, That the etymology of the names of the
months is to be sought in the arabic tongue, which he supposed the most
ancient dialect of egyptian. The conclusiveness of the ingenious essay
isi's arguments, is in proportion to the reasonableness of the postulates
on which they are based.
1 It is no doubt possible, however, ihat the appearances in certain por
tions of the sphere, may have suggested modifications or alterations of
the emblems; as in the case of the sign Gemini, which, as we shall here
after have occasion to observe, seems to have been consecrated to two
kindred or twin deities, timtti (ml, perhaps from the remarkable appear
ance of two brilliant stars close to each other, in an otherwise not very
brilliant part of the heaven which it represented.

whom the institution originated, were, from the first,
signs or iu^uutnifdtogiot, and not constellations—portions
of the sun's course in the heavens, corresponding, more
or less accurately, to the seasons, not imaginary forms
in the celestial sphere—we have strong proof in the
tradition preserved of the manner in which the astro
nomers of those nations subdivided the ecliptic. I
shall not go into the minute details of their method,
as described by Macrobius of the Egyptians, and by
Sextus Empiricus of the Chaldees,TM and quoted and
illustrated by various popular authors among the mo
derns." It will be sufficient to observe, that, by a
species of clepsydra, they first measured the diurnal
revolution of the heavens, noting the departure and
return of a particular star to and from the same point
of the horizon, and then pointing off twelve equal por
tions of the circle of the equinoctial, commencing from
this star ; which portions, transferred to the ecliptic,
constituted the zodiac, and were therefore quite dif
ferent in their nature from the fanciful constellations
of unequal size into which the Greeks afterwards dis
tributed the same zone. The method here alluded to
is so vague, as to have excited the ridicule of some,0
who nevertheless have not ventured to deny the va
lidity of the substance of the tradition, however they
may have been inclined to criticise its details. It
would appear also, as well from this mode of division
as from the correspondence of the signs to the twelve
months of the year, that the cardinal points of the

sun's course could hardly have been placed elsewhere
than at the commencement of the signs. That such
was the case, is still farther evident from the circum
stance, that the zodiac, on its introduction into Eu
rope, and first application by the Greeks to their ca
lendar, was, in fact, so constituted. I know well how
little this assertion is in unison with the favourite
theories upon this subject ; but those theories are al
together of modern invention, and grounded on what
is, I am convinced, a fallacious view of the history of
the institution, totally unknown to the ancient au
thors, from whom our first notions of it are, or ought
to be, derived, and altogether repugnant to their tes
timony. This we shall have occasion to inquire into
farther, when we come to treat of the use of the zo
diac in Greece. In proof of the correctness of the
opinion here advanced, I shall be contented, for the
present, to quote Hipparchus, who is, beyond a doubt,
the highest authority in these matters, and who, when
criticising the works of certain of his own country
men, who followed a different arrangement, positive
ly asserts, that almost all the early astronomers fixed
their cardinal points in the beginning of the signs : xui

the coincidence of the first star of Aries with the equi
noctial colure, which is usually supposed to have given
rise to the present arrangement, did not take place
until the days of Hipparchus himself,11 it is evident
p Hipp. in Arat. Phenom. lib. ii. c. 3, in Petav. Uran. app. ad op. de
doct. temp. vol. iii. p. 120, conf. p. 119.
i Until after the days of Hipparchus, the greek astronomers reckoned
their longitude on the equinoctial, and not on the ecliptic. It is essen
tial that this should be borne in mind, in all references to the statements
of Eudoxus, Meton, and other ancient observers, concerning the positions



56 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
that the ancient mathematicians to whom he alludes
must either be the Egyptians or Chaldees themselves,
or those among his own countrymen who first adopt
ed the use of the zodiac from them, about the age of
Thales probably. If, therefore, preceding astrono
mers, of different ages, were in the habit of placing
the cardinal points at the commencement of the signs,
it is evident that the use of the institution among
them must have been precisely as above stated, name
ly, that a sign represented rather a season than a par
ticular group of stars. Accordingly, we learn from
Achilles Tatius, that Euctemon, one of the most an
cient greek philosophers recorded to have used the
zodiac, and who flourished three hundred years be
fore Hipparchus, placed the autumnal equinox in the
first of Libra, the winter solstice in the first of Capri
corn. Calippus, about one hundred years after Euc
temon, arranged his cardinal points in the same man
ner. Others there were, no doubt, who followed a
different method ; but almost all those concerning
whose astronomical opinions we have any authentic
tradition, agreed in making their divisions equal, that
is, consisting of thirty degrees each. It is evident,
therefore, on the authority of Hipparchus himself,
supported by that of the other classical authors on
this point of the history of science, that the distinc
tion between signs and constellations, supposed to be
an invention of that philosopher, is much more an
cient, and, in fact, coeval with the origin and primi
tive use of the zodiac itself; and that the arrangement
of the egyptian symbols into the irregular and fantas
tical constellations now visible on our globes, was
of the heavenly bodies for their respective ages. This matter has been
fully explained by Petavius, Var. Dissert, lib. ii. cap. 1, sq.



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. II. 57
probably an innovation of the Greeks, in the days, it
would appear, of Cleostratus of Tenedos, not long1 af
ter the introduction of the institution into Asia minor.
But this arrangement, as shall be shown hereafter,
seems to have been little attended to by the early
practical astronomers of Greece.
As it can hardly be supposed that the complicated
process, the details of which have been preserved by
Macrobius and Sextus Empiricus, relates merely to
one single and original distribution of the dodecate
moria, in the infancy of the civilization of each of the
two nations to whom they ascribe it, it may be farther
inferred, from the terms of their description, as well
as from the real nature of the zodiac itself, as shewn
above, that this division of its signs took place from
time to time, in order that the symbols might conti
nue to correspond to their respective seasons or por
tions of the sun's course, from whence they would
otherwise have varied owing to the precession of
equinoxes. This would necessarily imply an acquaint
ance on the part of the Egyptians with that pheno
menon ; which most of those who have treated of
their astronomical science have been inclined to doubt
or to deny. As I have, throughout these remarks,
endeavoured to combat what appear to me the exag
gerated opinions entertained by some, on the subject
of the antiquities of Egypt, I trust I shall not be con
sidered as falling into a similar error, when I state,
that it seems almost inconceivable, that any nation
among whom such an institution as the zodiac exist
ed, and who were in the habit of observing the hea
vens by a reference to its divisions, during perhaps
upwards of a thousand years, should have failed during
so long a period to discover the variation of the tro

pical and equinoctial points with respect to the fixed
stars. Ptolemy appears to ascribe to Hipparchus the
merit of having been the first who made this observa
tion,1 and though his language is somewhat ambigu
ous, yet this opinion, as if upon his authority, has
been very generally adopted by the moderns. Upon
this point I shall be contented to appeal to Hippar
chus himself, whose evidence must I conceive be su
perior to that of any other person ; and Avhose words,
in the following passage, not only furnish sufficient
proof that the fact was known, or at least suspected,
long before his time, but afford reasonable ground of
belief, that the Egyptians themselves were not unin
itiated into the mystery. The celebrated Eudoxus
of Cnidos, generally considered by the Greeks as the
greatest genius among their early astronomers, wrote
two works ; one called the Enoptron or Mirror, the
other the Phsenomena : from the first of these Hip
parchus quotes in the following terms : " Eudoxus
in his Enoptron observes, that ' the tropical points of
the sun's course appear to be subject to variation, but so slight as to be scarcely perceptible.' "s These
words of Eudoxus, which seem to have been misun
derstood by his less enlightened countrymen, as Atta
lus, and even Hipparchus, at the time when he wrote
the work from whence the above is an extract, speak
for themselves, and prove that the truth had in this
instance not escaped him ;' and as the advances made
by him in astronomical science, beyond his ignorant

countrymen of the day, are invariably attributed to
his having studied a considerable time in Egypt, it is
not unreasonable to suppose, that whatever informa
tion he may have possessed on this point, was derived
from the schools of Thebes or Heliopolis. As to what
use the Egyptians may have made of this discovery,
even supposing them to have made it, or how far they
may have applied it to the regulation of the difference
between the sidereal and the tropical year, that is an
other question, concerning which we have no data to
justify any satisfactory conclusion.
This opinion concerning the real use of the zodiac
among the Egyptians has, I find, been stated, and I
conceive judiciously and correctly, by Kircher, after
a learned Copt called Michael Schatta ; and on the
authority of the evidence of astronomical monuments,
preserved among the ruins which cover the banks of
the Nile, whether those recently brought to light by
european travellers, or perhaps others still more im
portant, now no longer in existence. " The images,"
says he, speaking of the egyptian sphere, " represent
ed under hieroglyphical symbols, do not exactly cor
respond to their places in the heaven, but for the most
part differ considerably ; nor need we be surprised at
this, since the object of the Egyptians in constructing
these hemispheres was not so much to delineate aste
risms, as the stations of their deities in the vast firma
ment. Nor did they, like the Greeks, suppose that
the figures of their objects of worship were made out
by certain groups of stars, but they denominated such
or such a group the station of a certain divinity, who
was supposed to preside over a certain portion of the
heaven."" The correctness of the first part of this

remark, that the constellations figured on the hiero
glyphical sphere do not always correspond to their
true places in the heaven, has been, as relates to the
planisphere of Dendera, admitted by all, and satisfac torily shewn by M. Biot,v in his dissertation on this
and the other greco-egyptian" astronomical monu
ments. The second part coincides with the opinion
above advanced respecting the true nature of the
egyptian zodiac. It is clear also, upon this principle,
that however consistent it may be with the phraseo
logy of modern science, to speak of a certain cardinal
point of the sun's course, having been at such or such
an aera in the sign of the Ram, Bull, or so forth, it
would be altogether incompatible with that of ancient
hieroglyphical learning. The Ram being merely an
emblem of the vernal equinox, that season was always
in the Ram, the autumnal equinox always in Libra ;
so that, in fact, the zodiac among the Egyptians would
be precisely what it now is among us, and has, in
truth, with little variety, always been in civilized Eu
rope, as has been stated above, and shall be pointed
out still more distinctly hereafter, by reference to the
most unimpeachable testimony of antiquity.

to the monuments both of the greek and roman period. The science of
the roman empire was in fact greek science ; and the manners and lan
guage of this country, in as far as derived from Europe, continued to be
greek. The hieroglyhical inscriptions of the roman emperors on these
monuments are couched, partly at least, in greek ; as is evident from the
interpreted titles Atnac^ctTUf, ZsCnss-of, &c.



OP ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. II. f)l
On the present hypothesis, that the twelve egyptian
months and the twelve signs of the zodiac formerly
corresponded—the one as a vulgar or civil, the other
as an astronomical or mythological calendar—to each
other, and to a form of year commencing in autumn,
the inquiry naturally suggests itself,—How and when
this correspondence existed ? whether was that form
of year the ancient reckoning of three hundred and
sixty days occasionally corrected, as I presume it must
have been, by some rude method of intercalation ?
or, was it the reformed calendar of three hundred and
sixty-five days, in which the five additional days, or
epagomense, were annually and permanently supplied ?
This is a matter of great obscurity, connected inti
mately with the question at what period the reform
of the calendar itself and the addition of the epago
mense took place ; the difficulty of which we have al
ready had occasion to notice, as well as the variety of
discordant opinions to which it has given rise among
the most celebrated chronologers of modern times. I
shall venture, in the sequel, to offer a few observa
tions on this head, although all that can be said, from
the great want of historical data, must necessarily re
solve itself into conjecture. As, however, this inquiry
does not essentially bear on the portion of our subject
with which we are at present engaged, I shall delay
entering farther upon it for the present, and proceed
in my endeavour to amplify and corroborate the sys
tem, which I have here ventured to propose and de
velop, by some close critical and etymological illus
trations of the names and characters of the individual
months of the calendar, in connexion with the signs
of the zodiac, derived from the mythology, language,
and general antiquities of Egypt. In so doing, I shall



02 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
take pains to avoid all far-fetched analogies, and re
sist all temptation to strain, at the expense of quibble
or subtlety, any connexion between the two systems,
where not in itself reasonable or probable ; but shall,
in analyzing the seasons in their order, content myself
with pointing out certain obvious and striking coinci
dences of a most unequivocal nature, comprehending
more than one-half of the signs, and offering a few
conjectures, to which I attach less Aveight, with re
spect to some others. That, with our still limited
sources of knowledge, we should be enabled at once
to clear up every portion of so enigmatical a system,
hinging upon the nicest adaptation to each other, of
various points of mysterious physical doctrine or local
superstition, is hardly to be expected ; but, consider
ing how much new and unexpected light has been
thrown on other portions of the symbolic mythology
of Egypt by the discoveries of the last thirty years, it
may be permitted to hope that something yet remains
behind calculated still farther to elucidate our present
subject. There are, too, various circumstances which
render it improbable that more than a certain number
of the emblems of the zodiac familiar to us should be
of pure egyptian original, the Greeks having, it would
appear, in adapting it to their own figurative astro
nomy, made some very important alterations in its
primitive form, by substituting, for instance, the claws
of the Scorpion for the egyptian sign of Libra, and
the Crab for the Scarabee. As no complete speci
mens of egyptian zodiacs have yet been brought to
light, but what are ascertained to have been executed
under the Romans after their occupation of the coun
try, we have but slender means of ascertaining what
other changes of a similar nature may have taken

place. But, even such as they are, the monuments of
the Thebais,* apparently a mixture of egyptian and
greek astrology, will be of great assistance in our re
searches into the original form and signification of the
signs.
There exists, however, one very important monu
ment among the ruins of Thebes, evidently of an as
tronomical nature, and which, as it belongs to one of
the celebrated tombs of the theban kings, must, I pre
sume, be referred to a period of antiquity far prior to
the greek or even the persian conquest. This curious
relic is published in the great french work on Egypt ;y
and, as I shall have occasion frequently to refer to it,
as confirming or illustrating my views, I have caused
a sketch of the most essential portion of it to be en
graved.* It contains a number of symbolic figures ;
among others, a procession headed by a figure bearing
an ear of corn, or some such object, followed at some
little distance by the god Thot, with his ibis-head ; a
scarabee supporting the disc of the sun ; another pro
cession, headed by a somewhat similar figure, of whose
hieroglyphic title the chief feature is a new-born in
fant ; a lion couchant ; a bull standing on another

emblem resembling the zodiacal sign Libra ; a non
descript animal, on whose back rides a crocodile ; a
vase, a scorpion, &c. These figures, several of which
are repeated on each side of the tablet or planisphere,
are unquestionably, in great part at least, astronomi
cal symbols, and most of them, it can hardly be doubt
ed, signs of the zodiac, although the irregularity of
their arrangement bears little or no reference to the
corresponding seasons. This last circumstance leads
to infer some mysterious signification ; any attempts,
however, to throw light upon that, whatever it may
be, have hitherto been, and will probably continue to
be, vain and inconclusive ; from all such, therefore, I
shall abstain. Other fragments there are, also con
nected with astrology, and probably of equal antiquity,
engraved in the same splendid work, where similar
figures occur singly or in lesser groups. There is an
other piece of egyptian art, of a mysterious and appa
rently astronomical nature, copies of which are not
uncommon in collections ; it is a small stela, sculptur
ed in relief, representing a naked male figure with a
fantastical headdress, standing upon two crocodiles
facing right and left ; in his left hand he holds two
snakes, a scorpion, and a lion—in his right, two
snakes, and a ram or goat. On the ground of the
relief are other emblematic figures, much mutilated,
in the only examples which I have seen. The back
and sides are covered with hieroglyphics. One of
these stelae is given in the plates to Bruce's travels,"
the original of which, the enterprising author informs
us, was found at Axum in Abyssinia ; and is probably

a remnant of the expeditions of the Ptolemies into
that country, or of the ancient communication civil
or military, between the tribes of the upper and low er Nile.b The traveller adds, that there are five or
six precisely similar in the British Museum ; and several are engraved by Kircher0 and Montfaucon.d
Other relics of egyptian or egyptio-greek astrology,
to which we shall have occasion to appeal in the
course of the ensuing inquiries, will be noticed in
their proper places. A few illustrations of no unim
portant nature, will be derived from a comparison of
the modern arab or persian spheres, with those of
Greece and Egypt. All being palpably derived
from the same stock, it is not unreasonable to sup
pose, that traces of the primitive common original,
which have been obliterated by the hand of time or
of innovation in one, may have been preserved more
entire in another.
As it may safely be assumed, that many of the
favourite superstitions of the Egyptians are as ancient
as the first formation of their calendar, it will appear
evident, that if we would attempt to explain at all
the mysterious import of those obscure and enigmati
cal ceremonies, which were attached to particular
days of their months, on the supposition which will
hardly be disputed, that they bore reference in their
origin to particular seasons of the year, or pheno
mena of the heavenly bodies, —we can only hope for
success, by going back to the original position of the
months in the early ages of their civilization, when

those feasts were first established ; and I shall have
occasion below to point out, on the basis of a year
commencing in autumn, how closely some of the
periodical solemnities, the particulars of which have
been transmitted to us by the Greeks, correspond to
their ancient places in the seasons. There can in
deed be little doubt, but that the regular shifting of
the feasts, which formed the essential peculiarity of
the reformed calendar, gave rise to a portion at least
of the mysterious significations ascribed by the
egyptian priests to many of their religious rites, which
to an ordinary observer appeared fanciful or unmean
ing. Take for example the death of Osiris, which
was celebrated towards the end of the month Athyr,
and was accompanied by certain solemnities signifi
cant of the distance of the sun from the zenith, and
the low state of the Nile ; this month we shall find,
at its primeval institution, to have been that immedi
ately preceding the winter solstice ; when such rites
were peculiarly appropriate. But seven hundred
years afterwards, the same ceremonies, though strictly
adhered to, were apparently altogether unmeaning ;
and therefore the knowledge of their true import be
came what is called a mystery ; namely a hidden or
esoteric doctrine attached to the solemnity, and only
familiar to the priests themselves, or those to whom
they were pleased to communicate it under strict
pledge of secrecy. But more of this in its proper
place.

CONTINUATION OF THE SAME SUBJECT.—INQUIRY INTO
THE PRISTINE FORM AND SIGNIFICATION OF THE

The names of the egyptian months, which we now
proceed to analyze, have been preserved in the works
of greek authors of various ages ; as well as in the
idioms of the native Copts, and Egyptio-arabs, among
whom they continued to be used in modern times.
That they are the primitive egyptian appellations is,
I believe, not disputed ; and indeed is placed beyond
a doubt, as well by the internal evidence which they
themselves afford of their connexion with the ancient
language and religion of the country, as by the con
stancy and harmony of the tradition, by which they
have been handed down through ages as such. I have
given below, in the notes, references to the authors
in whose works the most important varieties of these
names have been preserved, as well in the greek as
the Coptic idiom." To the coptic orthography the

greatest weight is in most instances to be attached, as
representing the pronunciation of the old dialect of
Egypt, for the most part it may reasonably be assum
ed, pure and unaltered. Occasional allusion has also
been made to the analogy of the Copto-arabic.
These names, as the egyptian scholar will see at
once, though of various characters, are for the most
part derived from the mythological nomenclature ;
each month, as Herodotusb has long since observed,
being peculiarly sacred to a certain deity. They may
be classed under three distinct heads. First, those
which are called simply by the names or titles of
deities ; such are Thot, Athor, Epiphi, Mesori. Se
condly, those which are not directly synonymous with
their patron divinities, but dedicated to them by the
common possessive pa, or pha, prefixed to their
names or titles ; as Paophi, Phamenoth, Pharmouthi,
Pachon, Paoni. Thirdly, those of obscure or doubt
ful import, perhaps of a miscellaneous, figurative
nature ; Choiak, Tobi, Mechir. With respect to
these last, I repeat as before, that where nothing
obvious occurs in the way of illustration, I shall re
frain from entering at large into speculations, which
might be liable to the reproach of being farfetched or
visionary.

Thot,c (Libra,)
According to the hieroglyphic emblem, the first month
of vegetation, dating from about the autumnal equi
nox, when the Nile retired from the land. The
name speaks for itself, being that of the deity repre
sented with the head of an Ibis, whom the Greeks
identified with their Hermes, and who, as the patron
of art, science, and literature in the egyptian pan
theon,11 naturally takes precedence in the civil calendar,
which was fabled his own invention ; his feast we also
learn from Plutarch was celebrated during this month.8
That Libra, of the egyptian zodiac, bore some re*
ference to the equal balance of day and night at the
equinox, there is no reason to doubt ; but that be
sides this, there was also a mysterious connexion, be
tween the emblem, and the god of the month to
which it belonged, we have very curious proof.
Among the most remarkable symbols or attributes,
by which this deity is usually attended in the figurative
mythology, are the egyptian ape or cynocephalus,
and the scales or balance. These attributes of Thot
are chiefly observable in the funereal papyri/ In the

principal scene of those extraordinary pictures, repre
senting the last judgment, Thot in his capacity of
secretary or chief minister, of Osiris in his character
of Serapis or judgeg of the infernal regions, invari
ably appears attended by his subordinate divinities,
presiding over the scales in which are weighed the
souls of departed mortals, and presenting his report
of their merits or demerits to his chief. On the
centre of the beam sits a cynocephalus, and helps to
adjust the balance ; and in the upper compartment of
the same figurative representation, the line of mytho
logical emblems, which forms as it were a frieze or
cornice of the porch of Amenthes where the judg
ment is held, is terminated at each end by a sitting
figure of a cynocephalus holding a balance in his
forepaws, in allusion to the awful ceremony below.1'
Horapollo, in the first and most valuable part of his
work, which is now generally admitted to contain the
best extant commentary on the hieroglyphic literature
of Egypt, informs us,' not only that the cynocephalus,
(as we learn also from other authors) was sacred to
Thot, but that a sitting cynocephalus was the emblem
of the equinox ; as an attendant then on the patron
deity of the ancient equinoctial month he is quite in
in his place. But besides, this animal, as sacred to
Thot, was also a favourite personification of the deity

himself, who is frequently represented under the figure of a cynocephalus,k as Ammon under that of
a Ram, Horus of a Sparrowhawk, &c. So that here
we have in fact Thot himself emblematic of the same
season. The scales which he holds in his hand, and
which are not only an attribute of Thot, but a symbol
of the equinox to this day, require little farther com
ment.
We shall have occasion to observe in the sequel,
how closely egyptian superstition connected the mi
gration of souls, and the mythology of the world of
spirits or Hades, with astrology, the sun's course in
the heavens, and the vicissitudes of the seasons. Of
the connexion between the infernal balance of Thot,
and the. Scales of the zodiac, we have farther inci
dental proof in the circumstance, that immediately
in front of the deity in the papyri,1 and beneath the
tablet on which he is writing, is an infant or ju
venile human figure mounted on a staff, evidently
bearing some mysterious reference to the peculiar
office of the god ; and accordingly we find that the
figure of the Balance on the zodiacs of Denderah, is
invariably accompanied by a medallion containing
such a juvenile form, crouching in a similar attitude
between the scales. But besides the scene of the
funereal papyri, to which, as most common and fami
liar, I have here referred more particularly, we find
Thot appearing with the same attributes, on other
occasions which bear a most unequivocal reference to

the calendar. In plate xxxv. vol. ii. of the Anti
quities of the Description de l'Egypte,"1 he is repre
sented standing as above before his divine master ;
behind him the scales surmounted by the cvnocepha
lus, and served by the same two subordinate divini
ties as in the papyri. Here, however, another em
blem, probably connected with the calendar, is substi
tuted in the scale for that of the soul, and Thot holds
in his hand, not, as before, the tablet and style, to
cast up the account of human good and evil, and strike
the balance of reward or punishment, but in his left
hand he grasps a long rod or wand, gradually bending
towards the upper extremity, with notches cut regu
larly on the exterior curve from top to bottom ; of
these notches, with an index which he holds in his
hand, he points off a certain number. A precisely
similar rod, when marked with only one notch, has
been ascertained to be the symbol or hieroglyphic of year ;n hence it is reasonable to suppose, that, when
notched in its whole length, it denotes a number of
years, and that the pointing off a certain number de
TM See Plate IV. n Young, Art. Egypt, p. 70, pl. lxxvii. No. 180. Champ. Precis. p.
214, pl. xiii. No. 5. To this symbol I understand Horapollo to allude
(lib. i. c. 3) where he tells us, that, to represent a year, they drew a palm,
because that tree shot forth a branch every month. He probably means
a palm branch or sapling, as the hieroglyphic rod is not unlike such an
object, rudely or conventionally delineated ; and, if so, the additional
shoots must be understood as of years, not months. Dr. Young, (loc. sup.
cit.), who first identified this symbol, observed that it resembled a plant,
and the notch in its centre an annual shoot or bud. Horapollo also in
forms us, (i. c. 4), that, to denote a month, they drew a palm branch, or
an inverted half-moon. This last is the sign of month in professor Kose
garten's calendar. Of the palm branch for the same sign I know of no
example ; which confirms me in the opinion, that Horapollo's description
is, here as elsewhere, however valuable, not minutely correct, and that
he has confounded the respective symhols of year and month.



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. III. 73
notes a special number of years set apart for some pe
culiar purpose. This, it may be presumed, was the
hieroglyphical use of the rod, the number of notches
actually cut in it having no particular chronological
meaning, but denoting years in general ; but the num
ber pointed out or indicated by the bearer cannot but
admit of some mysterious signification, connected with
the adjustment of the calendar, civil or astronomical.
Various other monuments, where this same figura
tive rod occurs, with the ceremony of marking off or
subdividing its notches, have been examined by M.
Champollion," who supposes the ceremony to allude
to the regulation of the national festivals or ira»riyvgiig
at stated intervals. This interpretation, there can be
little doubt, is as accurate as it is ingenious, with re
gard to several, at least, of the monuments illustrated
by that distinguished critic, which seem to belong
chiefly to the greek or roman periods, and where the
rods are held by various deities or other personages.
But, in the one to which our observations have been
directed, there is this distinctive peculiarity, that the
rod is not only held by Thot, but the Cynocephalus
and Scales form an important feature of the group,
which is wanting on all others of a similar nature that
I have had an opportunity of seeing. Whatever may
be the precise signification of this mysterious cere
mony, we have, at least, here Thot with his scales
and cynocephalus, as the regulator of the calendar ;
and the scales and cynocephalus being symbols of the
equinox, and the hieroglyphic of the month of Thot
being also a symbol of the autumnal season, we have
confirmation strong of the opinion here advanced,
° Precis du Syst. hier. p. 215, sqq.



74 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
that the equinox of autumn was the place in the year
originally occupied by that month, for all these coin
cidences could hardly be the refult of chance.
In the painting of the theban tomb/ as above ob
served, there is a procession, headed by a figure, bear
ing an ear of corn, or a sprig of some other vegetable
production, in its hand, doubtless symbolic of the con
stellation Spica, or Virgo of our sphere. In front is
the Lion. This figure is followed by three others,
whose persons are marked by no distinctive attributes,
probably subordinates or companions of the leader with
the Spica ; but immediately in their rear marches the
god Thot, between the very same two lesser deities,
who act as his ministers in the ceremony of adjusting
the balance. May not we conjecture that we have
here Leo, Virgo (Spica), Libra ?
All this receives light from a passage of Julius Fir
micus,q an author who appears to have preserved many
genuine remains of the old judicial astrology of the
Egyptians, according to the celebrated chiefs of that
school, Nechepsos and Petosiris, and who, in treating
of the influences of the signs on human destiny or cha
racter, makes Libra produce : Sacerdotes, et quibus
deorum secreta credantur, musicos, regumque scribas,
vel quibus dictandi committant officium ; medicos,
geometras, mathematicos, negotiatores, templorum
ministros, &p. &c. ; every one of which qualities or
occupations were under the special patronage of Thot.
It might, perhaps, be objected by some, that on the
more ancient greek sphere there is no such sign as
Libra, its place being occupied by the claws of the
Scorpion, and, therefore, that the symbol itself was a
r See Plate Il. i Astronomic, lib. viii. c. 25.



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. III. 75
recent innovation on the original zodiac ; and Pluche,1
probably after Hyginus,8 asserted that it was an inven
tion of the Romans, about the age of Augustus. No
great deference is, indeed, due to this authority, which
I was surprised to find has also been adopted by the
judicious Goguet/ and other critics, who usually go
deeper into their subject. It will, however, be worth
while to point out shortly the error of this opinion,
as, by so doing, we shall be enabled to advance still
farther evidence, that Libra was the primitive sign of
this season in the egyptian zodiac, and, by inference,
that both that sign and the zodiac itself are of egypt
ian invention.
The oldest extant greek author, professedly treat
ing of the signs of the zodiac, of whom we have more
than an incidental fragment, is Aratus, who certainly
never mentions Libra ; with him this sign is always
Chelae, or the Claws. Hipparchus," however, who
flourished upwards of a century and a half before the
christian era, once calls it Libra ; and with Geminus/
who lived about eighty years afterwards, it is the fa
miliar and ordinary term. Both these authors wrote
before Augustus was born ; the opinion, therefore, of
Goguet falls to the ground at once. As the Romans
were indebted for all their scientific institutions to
their more highly civilized neighbours, whether greek

obscure passage of Virgil, (georg. i. v. 32), which, however, his scholiasts
have not so understood. The utmost that can be inferred from it is, that
the Romans, having hitherto, like the more ancient Greeks, used the
Claws, Augustus, in imitation of the alexandrian Greeks, first substiluted
the Balance. u Ad. Arat. Phsenom. lib. iii- c. 2, in Petav. Uran. p. 131.

or oriental, it is not very likely, in itself, that, in
adopting their zodiac, in other respects entire, they
shoidd have been at pains to make an alteration in
this particular point ; still less is it to be conceived,
that, in the days of the Ptolemies, when Alexandria
was the central seat of learning and civilization, and
Rome herself had hardly begun to turn her attention
to the sciences, the greek mathematicians should have
sought for new technical terms in the rude almanacks
of Latium.
Libra occurs on all the extant egyptian zodiacs as
the sign of the equinoctial month of autumn, as well
as on those of the Arabs and other oriental nations,
who, it may be conjectured, borrowed, either directly
or indirectly, from Egypt. The present hieroglyphic
of the sign, of which there is some trace in the picture
of the theban tomb, is also apparently an abbreviated
representation of a portion of a balance. But, what
is still more decisive, Achilles Tatius," an author of
considerable weight in matters of astronomical his
tory, positively asserts Libra to be peculiarly and dis
tinctively egyptian : " The sun," says he, " in his
course through the zodiac, when he enters the Ram,
or the Claws, which the Egyptians call the Balance,
makes the days and nights equal." Tatius was him
self a native of Egypt, and therefore must have had
good opportunities of ascertaining the fact. The
same is stated equally positively by Servius,* in his
commentary on a line of the first Georgic, where Vir
gil (as the latin poets seem to have done by prefer
ence) calls the sign by its greek name of Chelse or
Claws : " The Egyptians affirm that there are twelve
w Fragment*, apud Petav. Uran. p. 96.
x Ad Virg. Georg. i. 32.



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. III. 77
signs, but the Chaldees eleven, for they make Libra
and Scorpio one, assigning to Libra the claws of the
Scorpion." By Chaldee, be it observed, must here
be understood, according to the ordinary phraseology
of this and other contemporary authors, the professed
astrologers of the day, who being chiefly Greeks, pro
bably used the old greek form ; for there is no reason
to believe, that the pristine Chaldee zodiac bore any
resemblance in this respect to that of Greece. There
is indeed an astrological poem which passes under the
name of Manetho/ where it is asserted that the
Egyptians also used the Claws in early times, which
emblem the priests afterwards changed into the Scales.
But to this work we can grant no claim to authority,
being a wretched piece of trifling, full of all sorts of
corruptions ; and if really the production of the cele
brated historian of the dynasties, can only show that
less deference is due to his testimony in matters of
science than of civil history.
The opinion here advanced respecting the superior
antiquity of Libra, has, I find, also been preferred by
the most distinguished historians of ancient astro nomy.z
From the details above given, it appears probable,
that the Greeks, on first adopting the egyptian zo
diac, corrupted this and the following sign, dividing
Scorpio into two, and substituting its claws for the
original Libra, for what reason it is not worth while

guage, probably, according to the old etymology :
riA&0<I, or IIAOr^n, the month of the Agatho
daemon, or sacred snake, so celebrated in the egyptian
pantheon. The word OOI or OYlI is apparently
a variety of the egyptian 2>0 1, Snake, and occurs as
an element of the appellations of both sovereigns and
private individuals ; according to the well known cus
tom of conferring upon mortals the names or titles of
deities, either simply, or combined as patronymic or
a There is a dissertation on this point by the german hellenist Butt
mann, inserted in the work of Professor Ideler, (sup. cit. s. 373.) The
alteration is supposed by him to have originated in a confusion of the
various primitive senses of the greek term %**i, X"Aa"', assumed in its
origin from the analogy of yfa-vs %ihonn. &c. to have anciently denoted
not only Claws, but shell, or scale ; german, Schale, Wagschale. The
solution is ingenious, though resting too much upon mere conjecture to
be quite admissible. See also Jollois et Devilliers. Desciipt. de l'E

dedicatory compounds."1 Thus, in the fourth dynasty
of Manetho, we find the second and third kings called
Souphis, or son of Ouphi ; as also the fifth king of the
third dynasty. Plutarch' mentions a priest of Helio
polis, in the days of Solon, called Psenophis, the sense
of which is similar ; and in a catalogue of egyptian
proper names, in a papyrus of the Borgian museum, we have nETOT<II, IlAOT<II;f this last maybe
considered as precisely the same compound as the
name of the month, and is by Champollion justly ren
dered ayaSoSa^on/o?.8
During this month, as we learn from Plutarch,"
was celebrated a feast called the Staff of the sun ; the
mysterious sense of which referred to his course mid
way between the equinox, and the most distant point
of the lower hemisphere, at which period he was
fabled to require support or assistance, to sustain him
on his journey.
We can here trace no connexion between the name
of the month, and the corresponding symbol of the
zodiac, of so satisfactory a nature as in the case of
Thot. There can however be no doubt, but that the
scorpion, though little noticed in the vulgar mytholo
gy of the Egyptians, must have played a distinguished
part in their scientific mysteries ; as it constantly oc
curs on their astrological monuments, not only. on
those of greco-egyptian art, but in the pictures of the

royal tombs, though of small size and apparently in a
subordinate capacity ;' on the stelae of Bruce and
Montfaucon ; as well as on various gems and scarabees.k Before therefore any satisfactory illustration
of this sign of the zodiac can be expected, we must
acquire more distinct notions of the figurative attri
butes or properties, which the priests in their wisdom
discovered in the natural history of this animal, with
reference to their climate ; concerning which we have
at present no historical data whatever. Several con
jectures indeed offer themselves, respecting the pro
bability that some mysterious combination of the
Agathodaemon and Scorpion, may have been the pri
mitive symbol of this month in the egyptian zodiac.
To these however I am unwilling to attach much
weight, not having yet been able to corroborate them
by a reference to either authorities or monuments
illustrative of the pure egyptian astrological fable.
It may yet be remarked, that a very important con
stellation of the greek sphere, called Ophiuchus, or
the Serpent-bearer, occupies a portion of the division
of the zodiac assigned to the Scorpion ; which reptile
he was feigned by the greek astrologers to trample
under foot :

The Serpentarius, as the Latins call him, was by some
commentators identified with Triptolemus,1" by others with Esculapius ;n both which heroes, and their atten
dant snakes, are mere counterparts of the egyptian
Agathodsemon, who is sometimes represented on the
monuments as a serpent mounted on the lower parts
of a man ;° which curious figure, I feel tempted to
suspect, is the original of the Ophiuchus of the greek
sphere, where so many images are evidently borrowed
from Egypt. This might justify the suspicion at least,
that both the reptiles above mentioned may have en
tered into the composition of this symbol among the
Egyptians. It will appear beyond a doubt in the se
quel, that the emblems, in the zodiac of that people,
were not so strictly limited to one figure as in the
corresponding signs of that of the Greeks. The ex
ample which we shall adduce of this below, in the case
of the sign Leo, where we find the Lion trampling
upon the evil genius of the season, might, by its ana
logy, lead to some inference respecting the probable
form of the original sign Scorpio.p

P That the scorpion was figurative among the Egyptians of the
typhonic influences, appears probable, as well from the very nature
of the animal, as from the circumstance, that on the zodiac he is
sometimes accompanied by an hippopotamus, which monster, as is well
known, was the familiar emblem of Typhon, and is himself here re
presented with the tail of a scorpion. See the sign Scorpio of the qua

jElian, (Hist. Anim. 1. x. c. 23.) describes a ceremony practised at fune
rals by the people of Coptos, where it was customary for enthusiasts to
trample upon Scorpions, as symbolic of the most noxious and dangerous
of objects, without receiving any hurt. The Agathodsemon, as figurative
of the sun, trampling upon a scorpion as Typhon, would be an apt enough

Athor,11 (Sagittarius,)
The sacred month of the goddess of the same name,
written, by the Greeks, Athor, Athyr, and Athyri ; by the Copts invariably Athor or Hathor ;r a deity
whose influence and attributes were closely connected
with the lower hemisphere, whether, in a mythologi
cal sense, as referred to Hades, or the shades of after
life, that is, the lower portion of the celestial region,
where the souls of departed mortals were supposed to dwell ;s or, in. a merely astronomical or physical sense,
as denoting the lowest position of the sun or planets
in the zodiac. The Greeks, for reasons which it is
unnecessary to explain at length, called her, in com
mon with other analogous divinities of the neighbour
ing oriental nations, Aphrodite or Venus. It is well
known that the Aphrodite of the greco-oriental my
thology was both a celestial and infernal goddess, both
Urania and Hecate ; and such also (in as far as the
peculiar character of the egyptian pantheon will per
mit the analogy) appears to have been Athor, and in
this respect to have corresponded both to the Astarte
of the Phenicians and the Alilat of the Arabs. Hence,
among the Greeks themselves, we find an 'Apgoh'r?]
type of the struggle between the powers of light and of darkness at this
season, alluded to in the festival mentioned above as celebrated during
this month. i Vid. Orion. ap. Etym. M. v. A/if. Hesych. ead. v.

dwell in the lower hemisphere of the celestial regions. Hence it is that

funereal attributes, are yet frequently, in inscriptions, styled celestial di

but that Athor was, like other lesser goddesses, mere
ly a personification of certain attributes of Isis, and
may be considered as that essence of the female god
head in her capacity of Hecate or Proserpine.* Plu
tarch assures us, that the name Athor or Athyri was, in fact, a title or epithet of Isis ;x and we shall find
that the feast celebrated during this month in honour
of Athor was also called the Isia or feast of Isis. Plu
tarch7 farther informs us, that Aphrodite was the same
as Nephthe, and that Nephthe represented TeXivrw,
the End, or to vtto yriv xai apuvkg, that is, the lower
hemisphere, either physically or mythologically ; and Diodorusz also calls this Nephthe, Aphrodite, or Ve
nus, which shows the correspondence of the three in
person and attribute to each other, and to the charac
ter of Hecate ; hence the egyptian 'A(p£>o5/r?? is called

It will appear, then, with what propriety this sea
son, during which the sun descended to the greatest
distance from the zenith, and dwelt the greater por
tion of the twenty-four hours beneath the horizon,
would be dedicated to the deity whose name it bears.
A striking illustration of this we have in the religious
rites celebrated during this month. Athor, as we
learn from the testimony of the ancients, confirmed
by that of the monuments, was frequently represented under the form of a heifer ;e and we find accordingly,
that, in the feast called by Plutarch' the Death or Loss
of Osiris, which commenced on the seventeenth of
this month, a gilded heifer, (which may either denote
a gilded image, or a living animal of a gold colour, or
with golden ornaments,) covered with black cloth,
was led in procession, figurative of the fall of the year,
the descent of the sun in the zodiac, and the low ebb
of the water of the Nile. Plutarch asserts that this
heifer was the image of Isis;g and we have observed
already, and shall amply prove in the sequel, that
Athor was here merely a personification of Isis.

Messrs. Salt*1 and Champollion1 have identified the
hieroglyphic name attached to the figure of the heifer,
which appears commonly at the end of the funereal
papyri, and in the more secret adyta of the tombs* as
that of Athor ; and we have before had occasion to
point out, as indeed every egyptian antiquary is aware,
how close a mysterious connexion there was between
the lower regions, in a spiritual sense, as the abode of
departed souls, and the lower portion of the sun's
course in the heavens. Hence, in the papyri, the
souls are made to travel to Amenti in the descending
bark of the sun and moon,1 which intimates that their
descent into the lower world took place under the
guidance of those luminaries as they sunk beneath the
horizon. Again, Eusebius informs us, that the Hip
popotamus was one of the emblems of the south pole,
or lower hemisphere, where the sun became invisible ;
and, accordingly, we find, that a chief attribute of
Osiris, as lord of Amenti or Hades, in the funereal
rituals, is an hippopotamus, who sits in front of the deity, while Athor stands behind him.m The abbre
viated symbol of this goddess, according to Champol
lion," was a woman's head with the ears of a cow?
This also forms the capitals of the columns of her
temple at Denderah, which contains the celebrated
remains of egyptio-greek astrology. And, besides the

by the circumstance, that, in the funereal rituals of the Vatican Papyri,
described by Mai, after Champollion, we find that Athor, or the sacred
heifer, is almost invariably the last of the deities of Hades to whom the
soul is presented, or to whom it addresses its supplications.

heifer, with the name Athor annexed, we find an
other" of a bright yellow or gold colour, appearing
with the title of mother of the sun, also in the sepul
chral papyri, and in the same position as Athor her
self, and which is, no doubt, merely another personi
fication of the same deity, as she wears the symbol of
Athor, above described, round her neck. The red or
yellow disc is also among her principal ornaments,
which she bears sometimes between her horns, some
times it is deposited on the prow of the mysterious
bark in which she travels. From the correspondence
of the colour, it is probable that this is the very golden
heifer described by Plutarch as led in procession in the
mournful ceremonies of the feast of Athor.
Plutarch, like others of the later greek authors who
treat of egyptian superstition, ignorantly or arbitrarily
explains the mysterious rites of this festival, as of se
veral others, by a confusion between ancient tradition,
and the positions of the egyptian months in the seasons
at the time he wrote ; according to the double reckon
ing of the alexandrian or Julian year recently intro
duced into Egypt, and the ancient moveable year,
which continued for long after to be in use among
the aboriginal inhabitants.11 In quoting, therefore,

p After the final settlement of Egypt by Augustus as a province of the
roman empire, the use of the Julian form of computation was established
in Alexandria, the first day of the new calendar being fixed to the 29th
of August, the Thot of the year in which the innovation took place ;
from which period, six, instead of five, supplementary days were added
at the end of every fourth year ; so that the form of the alexandrian year
was as follows :

from him, as well as other authors of the same stamp,
we must be cautious, while we extract from them va
luable facts, not to allow ourselves to be misled by
too great a deference to their fanciful commentaries.
This leads us to some important observations on the
history and mysterious signification of this festival of
the death' of Osiris, the result of which will, I trust,
afford strong evidence that the month Athor, to which
it was appointed, originally occupied the place we
have assigned it at the establishment of the primitive
egyptian calendar.
Achilles Tatius,q in treating of the zodiac, observes,
that " the Egyptians formerly, perceiving the descent
of the sun from Cancer upon Capricorn, and the
nights prolonged, were wont to mourn, as if fearing

The ancient moveable year, however, maintained ijs ground among the
aboriginal natives in vulgar use, and as the regulator of the returns of
their religious solemnities, up to a very late period. (Dodw. App. ad
diss. cyp. § iv. Theon. ap. eund. in fin.) So that we have thus two ca
lendars of precisely similar form in use at the same time, in the same
country, differing only in the circumstance, that the year of the one, by
means of the quadrennial intercalation, was fixed, while that of the other
retrograded a day in the seasons every four revolutions. About the se
cond century after the christian era, the relative points of the two in the
tropical year differed considerably, which has been the source of a consi
derable deal of error in the writings of Plutarch, and other authors of
that period, who confound the dates of \the two in treating of egyptian
matters. (Conf. Scaliger, de Emend, temp., p. 222. Ideler Unters. iib.

lest he should leave them altogether, and this is the
time of what they call the Isia ; again, when he be
gan to reascend, they put on gay clothes, and decked
themselves with garlands." That these Isia are pre
cisely the same with the festival called by Plutarch the
death of Osiris, which began on the seventeenth of
Athor, is, I believe, admitted by both chronologers
and mythologists, and is proved as well by the great
similarity in the description of the two solemnities, as
by other collateral evidence. For example ; Geminus/
in illustration of the peculiarities of the egyptian ca
lendar, mentions, that it was a vulgar error among
the Greeks to suppose that ike Isia Jell on the winter
solstice, as fixed by Eudoxus ; " for, indeed, an hun
dred and twenty years ago," says he, " that was the
case ; but as the egyptian feasts, in consequence of
the deficiency of their calendar, go back a day in the
seasons every four years, there has arisen in one hun
dred and twenty years a difference of a full month ;
so that those who suppose them still to be celebrated
at the winter solstice show very gross ignorance."
Now we find by calculation, that, in the year 195
b. c, the seventeenth of Athor, the first day of the
solemnity described by Plutarch, coincided with the
twenty-sixth of December old style, which was also
the winter solstice as fixed by Eudoxus ; deduct from
these 120, and we have J5 b. c, which ought, upon
our hypothesis that the two feasts are the same, to be
the epoch about which Geminus wrote : accordingly
we find that this is in fact the sera assigned him by
the best chronologers, partly on the authority of the
above coincidence, partly from its being amply justi
f Elem. Astion. c vi ap. Petav. op. cit. p. 10.



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. III. 89
fied by the internal evidence of his own writings.*
And here it will be remarked, that this same vulgar
error of the Greeks, noticed by Geminus, leads to an
inference of some importance to our subject ; for as
this feast, as both he and Eratosthenes' rightly ob
serve, wandered through the year, falling successively
on spring, summer, autumn and winter, it is not like
ly that their countrymen of different ages should thus
so curiously agree in connecting the mysterious signi
fication of its rites with the sun's motion at the winter
tropic, unless the period of its celebration, to which
those rites bore reference, at its original institution,
really had coincided with that season.
A comparison of the respective descriptions of
Achilles Tatius and Plutarch, will tend still farther
to prove the identity between the Isia and the Death
or Loss of Osiris, as well as to throw light on the
original signification of the feast. Tatius, as we have
seen, divides it into two parts ; the first was grief for
the rapid decline of the luminary, some time before
the solstice ; the second, joy for his return, after he
had well passed the tropic. Accordingly, from Plu
tarch" we learn, that the first or mournful ceremony
lasted four days, from the seventeenth to the twen
tieth inclusive, many days before the actual sol
stice, according to the ancient position of this month ;
the joyful ceremony was not for many days after wards, probably well on in the next month ;v when,
according to the same author, " going forth towards
the sea, the pi'iests and ministers brought out the sa

cred chest, containing a golden casket, into which
pouring fresh water, all present raised a cry that Osi
ris was found." This arrangement, it will be ob
served, is not without its meaning, but highly appro
priate, and consistent with the vulgar opinion respect
ing the motion of the sun, which remains to all ob
servation stationary, during many days before and af
ter that of the actual tropic. In the time of Geminus,w who is high authority in these matters, the po
pular notion of the day extended this period to about
twenty days before, and as many after the solstice.
Nor does the opinion, that the feasts of the ancients
were distributed with reference to the seasons upon
this principle, rest on mere conjecture ; we have on
this subject a curious passage of the emperor Julian,*
who, if any man, was well informed in the history
and antiquities of pagan superstition, whether egyp
tian, greek, or roman. It is a description of certain
festivals of the roman calendar, corresponding in a
very striking manner to the egyptian Isia. " Imme
diately after the completion of the month of Saturn
(December), we celebrate magnificent games to the
sun, called the feast of the Invincible Sun, in which
it is not permitted to introduce any of those unseem
ly though necessary rites, which belong to the previ
ous month ; but the Saturnalia being at an end, the
feast of the Sun comes next in succession ; nor was it
the intention of the ancients, that this solemnity
should be fixed to the very day on which the god
passes the tropic, but to that on which his return
from south to north first becomes perceptible to all ;
for they knew not yet the nice mode of observation,

afterwards discovered by the Chaldees and Egyptians,
and perfected by Hipparchus and Ptolemy."y
The account given by Apuleius* of the Isia as ce
lebrated at Corinth, still more distinctly shows their
identity with the Feast of Athor ; as he mentions the
same two acts of the mythological drama, described
by Plutarch as usual in that feast ; first, the carrying
in procession a heifer the image of the goddess ; and
secondly, the ceremony of going down to the sea with
the sacred bark, followed by rejoicings.
Plutarch" in another place states, that at the solstice
itself they led the heifer seven times round the tem
ple ; which was called the Search of Osiris. It may
be a question, whether this inaccurate author means
to assert that this was a fixed feast ; or whether, as is
more probable, according to the vulgar error stigma
tized by Geminus, he has confounded in this, as in
other instances, the mysterious origin of the ceremony
with the period of its actual celebration ; but in either
case, its connexion with the other rites of Athor is
very obvious. It may have been originally a supple
mentary solemnity at the solstice itself, the search na
turally intervening between the losing and finding of
the god. The Arabs to this day call the seven days
of the winter solstice Aiam Alagiuz, the days of the old woman, or the lame and impotent days jb which
y This description corresponds sufficiently with the positions of the
festivals of the Saturnalia and of Phsebus, in the extant roman calendars ;
(Ap. Grsev. Thes. Antiq. roman. torn. viii. init. Court de Gebel. Mond,

many after the solstice.

92 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
figurative expression is evidently derived from the old
egyptian fable, that the Sun at this period of the year
was feeble and impotent, and on his reapproach to the
zenith was gradually renovated into childhood and
youth.
There can be no doubt but that the commemora
tion of the birth or finding of Harpocrates at the
winter solstice, so celebrated by latin authors, was
merely another name under which the Isia were
known among the Romans, when introduced into
their familiar mythology ; both festivals comprising
the like alternate mournful and joyful ceremonies,
typical of the declining, stationary, and ascending
condition of the solar orb. This Harpocrates is de
scribed as a son of Isis, and amid the general con
fusion of persons which forms the distinctive peculi
arity of the egyptian pantheon,0 seems, like Osiris
and his own brother Horus, under some of their at
tributes, to have been merely a personification of the
sun. The best method of illustrating this, will be to
quote a few passages of those authors where his rites are described. "Isis," says Plutarch,d " brought forth
Harpocrates about the winter solstice, unformed and
tender." Now Macrobius says, that the various posi
tions of the sun were typified among the Egyptians,
by the childhood, youth, manhood, and old age of the
human body, and that at the winter solstice he was
likened to an infant, " in which form he is brought
by the priests out of the sanctuary on a certain day ;"
" Haec astatum diversitates ad solem referuntur, ut

' See Append. No. XVI. i De Is. et Os. c. 65.

proferunt ex adyto certo die, quod tunc brevissimo
die veluti parvus et infans videatur."* Macrobius,
be it remarked, does not say that this ceremony took
place at the winter solstice, but that it bore a myste
rious allusion to that season, being attached to a cer*
tain day, that is of the egyptian year, no doubt the
very same on which the finding of Osiris took place ;
both being in fact the same solemnity. Accordingly*
both seem to be ridiculed conjointly by Minutius
Felix/ in the following powerful language : " Isis
perditum filium, cum Cynocephalo et calvis sacerdo*
tibus, luget, plangit, inquirit ; mox, invento parvulo,
gaudet Isis, exultant sacerdotes, nee desinunt omni

quod perdunt. Isis, with her Cynocephalus and
bald priests, wailing and lamenting, seeks her lost
son ; presently the infant is found, Isis rejoices, the
priests exult ; nor do they fail every year either to
lose what they find, or to find what they lose." The
same is stated with little variety by Lactantius :g
" The rites of the egyptian Isis consist in the losing
and finding of her infant son ; first the priests beat
their breasts and lament, as she is feigned to have
done when she lost him ; then the child is brought
forth, as if found, and their mourning is turned into
joy ; for they are always either finding or losing."
The identity of this feast and of the rites of Athor
appears to be farther confirmed by the evidence of a greco-egyptian tablet, published by Kircherh and Mont
faucon,1 sculptured in relief on both sides, and repre

senting two distinct acts of the mysteries of Isis.
On one compartment we have a figure of a cow or
heifer, borne in procession on a staff ; on the other
we have a similar procession, where, however, a new
born infant is substituted for the heifer. This alludes,
without doubt, to the substitution of the joyful for
the mournful ceremonies, as in the foregoing descrip
tions ; and throws light upon the mysterious title
conferred on the heifer representing Athor, noticed
in the first part of this article, namely Mes Re, Mo
ther of the sun ; as, in her present capacity, she was
in fact Isis mother of Harpocrates, the symbol of the
sun at this season, distinct, as shall be shown, from Isis mother of Horus.k
I have formerly had occasion to observe generally,
that it is probable some of the esoteric doctrines,
which the old Egyptians affected to attach to these
periodical solemnities, may have borne reference to
their mystical import, as connected in their origin
with certain seasons, which remark appears amply
confirmed by the foregoing details respecting the
Isia. On the decline of the national character and
institutions, after the permanent subjection of the
country to the Greeks and Romans, these mysterious
significations, such as they were, gradually became
trite and public, as is evident from all that has been
somewhat similar, ap. Spon. Rei antiq. select. qiuest. in Poleni Suppl. ad

expected from their very nature, to many nations. (Vid. Court de Ge
belin, Hist. du Calendr. Monde prim. t. iv- p. 285.) Besides the Sa
turnalia of the Romans above noticed, Hyde describes a feast among- the
ancient Persians of a like nature ; and to a similar association of ideas he,
perhaps reasonably enough, would refer some of the old rites of Twelfth
night in England. (Relig. vet. Pers. 2d edit. p. 253, 256.)



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. III. 95
said above. But in the days of Herodotus1 the case
was different. That author describes this festival
somewhat in the same terms as the others, but does
not venture upon any explanation of its meaning ;
observing, that he was not at liberty to disclose the
real motive of the lamentations, with which it was
accompanied. Herodotus may have visited Egypt
about 450 tf. c, at which time the seventeenth of
Athor fell on the twenty-seventh of February old
style, when it is clear the mournful ceremonies of
the Isia, could only have had a mysterious connexion
with the circumstances of their institution.
The foregoing illustrations sufficiently confirm the
remark already made, that Athor, like several other
egyptian deities, was, in reality, merely one of the
personifications of Isis, the essence of the female god
head, whom she represented in that capacity of infer
nal deity which entered into her attributes, as well as
into those of her husband Osiris. Accordingly, Plu tarch informs usm that Isis was sometimes called Mout,
sometimes Athyri. The first of these titles or epi
thets shall be examined in the sequel ; as for Athyri,
("A3i;g>i,) it is evidently one of the synonymes or va
rieties of Athor, and denoted, according to the same author, literally, the mundane habitation qfHorus.n

That he was right in this interpretation, has been
abundantly proved by recent discoveries, the figura
tive emblem of this goddess having been observed
by Messrs. Champollion0 and Salf to be a square, the
hieroglyphic of House, in which sits a sparrow-hawk,
the common symbol of Horus. This curious emblem
occurs, among other instances, in the plates of the
tomb of the theban king, published by Belzoni ;q where
the female figure who stands behind the throne of the
egyptian Pluto is Athor, with her name and titles af
fixed. In Champollion's Pantheon1 we have a figure
of the goddess wearing as a crown this hieroglyphical
house, decked with a fringe of lotus flowers, the em
blem of the lower region, of which I conceive Athor
as 6ixog"Clgou to be typical. The symbol suggests at
once the etymology of the word, the principal ele
ments of which are evidently the coptic HI or AI,
House, and the name of the god its inhabitant.8 It
priate than that of Horus, and has even gone the length of substituting it
in his english version. It would, however, require many more and
stronger arguments than any adduced by him to justify so strange a li
berty, even if the emendation were not nullified by the clear testimony
of the hieroglyphic monuments.

8 That this was the true sense of the name, occurred to Lacroze (Thes.
Epist. pt. iii. p. 159,) who supposes it to be compounded of HI, house,
0O, the world, and the name of the god. This would give HI 0' ftp,
which is not inadmissible, and would render very closely, and to the let
ter, the mysterious signification of the word, according to the interpreta
tion of the passage of Plutarch adopted by that critic. I should, how
ever, prefer a more simple form, HI0-HP, the House of Horus, the ar
ticle being postfixed to the governing substantive. The word HI, I am
aware, is masculine in modern Coptic ; but in the hieroglyphic texts it is
usually accompanied by the feminine article, or, at least, by the semicircle
denoting the feminine gender, (Champol. Prdcis. tab. gen. No. 278, 279,
280,) which justifies the conjecture, that, in the ancient sacerdotal dia
lect, the noun itself was feminine. Besides, it is evident, that, in the pres



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. HI. 97
is not difficult to guess the allusion contained in this
mysterious appellation ; for the Sun, who enters into
the sacred character and attributes of several egyptian
deities, and more especially of Horus, the sparrow
hawk god, by the united testimony of antiquity, des
cending, during this month, on that point of the zo
diac where he appeared, when visible, lowest in the
heaven, and remained the greater number of hours
beneath the horizon, might well be said to take up
his abode with that deity of the lower hemisphere or
region (to wo yr,v xut atpuvig) to whom the season was
especially dedicated.
From all this it may be collected, that Isis, as mo*
ther of Harpocrates, and Athor, as the house of Ho
rus, at this season, were merely symbolic representa
tives of the same deity, in an almost precisely similar
capacity. The name Harpocrates means literally,
Horus lame in the foot, allusive to the embarrassed
motion of the sun at the solstice ; for these two ju
venile deities, Horus and Harpocrates, were but two
different personifications of the same emblematic ori
ginal, the one born of Isis at the winter solstice, called
Harpocrates, or Horus lame, the other produced at a
s<mt case, even a masculine noun, when adopted as the proper name of a
female goddess, might become feminine in composition ; thefemale House
of Horus.
This form of the genitive case in simple regimen, as in the idiom of the
Semitic languages, is very common, and, indeed, prevalent in old egypt
ian, as appears from the traditional remains of that tongue in its pure
state transmitted by the Greeks, and the eoptic proper names, 2I-H2IJ
XEMNOTTE, &c, as well as the interpreted hieroglyphic texts. In
modern eoptic, it is, I believe, rare or obsolete, the genitive case being
formed by a servile prefix or preposition. The postfixing of the article,
so common in the ancient, is also unknown or unusual in the modem
dialect, (cf. Champ. Pre'cis. p. 127.)
The etymology above proposed has, I find, occurred, in part at least, to
Alberti. (Not. ad Hesych. v. 'Ali/e )

different season from the same female deity, called
Horus simply, or Horlis sound or perfect, as shall be
shown in its proper place.
With respect to any connexion between this month
and the sign Sagittarius; —the Greeks, there is no doubt,
identified Horus with their Apollo, whose emblem is
a bow and arrow ; and we have authority to believe
that such an attribute also belonged to the egyptian
deity, according to the primitive mythology. It may
be observed, that the figure of the Sagittarius, on the
circular planisphere of Denderah, has a janus or
double-headed bust ; one of the faces is that of a spar
roW'hawk ; the animal's body is that of the coW spe
cies, with cloven feet ; the head-dress is that peculiar
to Osiris in his character of Pluto ; all which seems
to hint at some connexion between the season and the
deities into whose influences thereon We have just
been inquiring. On the quadrangular zodiac, the em
blems, though somewhat varied, are analogous. In
the janus, the head of a lion is indeed substituted for
that of the sparrow-hawk,* but the bird itself is repre
sented entire, sitting on the back of the cloven-footed
animal. There is, however, another mysterious re
presentation in the same compartment, which consti tutes a principal portion of the emblem of the sign ;u
a human figure with the head of a sparrow-hawk, evi
dently Horus, transfixes with a dart or arrow a hi
deous nondescript, probably one of the personifications
of Typhon, or the evil genius, whose tail or train is
1 This substitution may receive light from a comparison of the sign
Leo, as will be seen presently ; the lion, or lion's head, being but another
type of the sun combating the typhonic influences' He is also support

OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. III. 99
held by another monster, usually supposed, and, I
conceive, with justice, to be the hippopotamus, which,
we learn from the ancients, was the ordinary emblem
of Typhon or of the south pole. In the picture of the theban tombv the sign Sagittarius seems to be re
presented by the same symbolic adventure. The fi
gure of Horus appears there also combating sometimes
a crocodile, one of the common emblems of the lower
hemisphere," sometimes a nondescript monster, not
tinlike that pourtrayed as engaged with the same deity
in the zodiac of Denderah. The classical commenta
tors of the zodiac inform us, that the real meaning of
the symbol Sagittarius was doubtful ; but, according
to Eratosthenes" and others, the arrows he bore were
the same with which Apollo had destroyed the Cy
clops, in revenge of the death of Esculapius. It is
obvious how naturally the Greeks would connect or
confound this fable, with the egyptian tradition of the
war of Typhon against Osiris, and his defeat and death
by the hand of Horus. And the analogy between
this mysterious combat, and the struggle of the deities
of light against the evil influences of the lower hemi
sphere in the tropic, during the month of Athor, is very
palpable. All this may be elucidated by the following
passage of Eusebius :y—" The light of the moon is
consecrated in the city of Apollinopolis. Its symbol
is a man with the head of a sparrow-hawk, attacking
with a dart2 Typhon, in the form of a hippopotamus."

The image is light in its colour, as denoting the bor
rowed light of the moon. The head of the sparrow
hawk shows that its light is derived from the sun, for
the sparrow-hawk is sacred to the sun, as the symbol
of light and spirit ; but the hippopotamus denotes the
lower hemisphere. The god who is worshipped in
this city is Horus." The moon combined with Ho
rus, whilst he combats with an arrow the hippopota
mus, or Typhon of the lower hemisphere, can denote
nothing else but the united forces of the divinity of
light, combating the typhonic influences which oppose
his progress in the winter tropic, during the month of
Athor, with whom he then takes up his habitation.
This mystical junction of the two luminaries at this
season, and in this position, in the physical mythology,
may be connected with the figure already mentioned
of the spiritual mythology, that the souls descended
into Amenti in the bark of the Sun and Moon. We
certainly have here a striking enough analogy between
the symbols of the deities of this month, and those of
the corresponding division of the zodiac.
Choiak, ( Capricornus.)
The name of this month is very obscure. The
only word in the egyptian mythological vocabulary to
which it bears anv resemblance, is the name of the
god Sevek, or Souak, of which we may perhaps be
permitted to conjecture Choiak to be a variety or cor
ruption ; the guttural being substituted for the sibi
lant, as these two sounds are very commonly con
founded in coptic : thus we find the month Pachon
written also Pashon ; Mechir, Meshir ; besides many



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. III. 101
other examples.6 This deity is personified under the
form of a crocodile,0 the name of the animal being the same as that of the god, according to Strabod and
Damascius.6
We have already remarked, that among the zodia
cal symbols of the royal tomb, is a crocodile riding on
the back of another animal, apparently an hippopota
mus, the hieroglyphic of the lower hemisphere. A
similar group is not uncommon on scarabee gems ;
on several published in Count Pahlen's collection,'
the crocodile is represented mounting on a goat ;
which infers a mystical union between Mendes or
Pan and Sewek. This might be merely a variety of
the symbol of the tomb, and approaches as nearly as
can well be imagined to Capricorn of the greek zo
diac, a nondescript, half goat half fish. Horapollo8
mentions a crocodile, or the tail of a crocodile, which
may be the hinder part of Capricorn in its combined
state, among the emblems of the lower hemisphere or
south pole. The position of this month in the seasons
would render the figure equally appropriate as applied
to it. These coincidences justify at least the conjee^
ture, that the crocodile of the tomb may be the pro
totype of the greek Capricorn.11

The first month of drought, or of harvest ; for that

which took place the return of Ms from Phenicia.
Without paying too implicit a deference to his account

unless we derive it from the correspondence of the two in character and

solstitial season was dedicated to Saturn ; who, after his expulsion from
Olympus, became one of the principal divinities of the lower regions :

The tradition that Saturn fled from Greece to the west, or to Latium, as
a hiding-place, whence Virgil : Latiumque vocari maluit ; his quoniam
tutus latuisset in oris: (Mn. viii. v. 322.) and Ovid: Dicta fuit Latium

of his being thrust into the Shades. The ideas of West, Sunset, M"f>
Darkness, and the lower regions in a spiritual sense, are inseparable in
the primitive greek fable ; where, as in that of Egypt, the astronomical and

closely connected; as is clear from the whole N«g«f«*»tH<* of the Odyssey,

savours little of the pure egyptian mythology, we have
at least enough to suggest the etymology of the name
of the month, and possibly the sense in which it was
applied. Tobi in coptic means to return, repay, or
restore. This was the season in which it would
seem that, according to the ordinary course of egyp
tian agriculture, as influenced by the peculiarities of
the climate, the blade shot forth its full ear, and the
early crops began to ripen for the harvest ;1 from
which period the earth returned, in rapid succession,
the various deposits committed to her breast by the
husbandman, since the period of the first subsiding of
the Nile ; so that there could not be a more appro
priate appellation of the season, than the return of
Isis, the Demeter or Ceres of Egypt. The probabi
lity of this etymology has occurred to the learned
Rossi,"1 who has assigned it a place in his lexicon,,
though without entering into any analysis of the mys
terious signification of the word. We have an appo
site illustration of this in the chinese calendar," where
the first month after the winter solstice, for a different
reason, though by a precisely similar analogy, is called
Fou or Return ; by which, says De Guignes, they
denote the return of yang, that is, the principle of
heat, which since mid-summer had constantly de
clined, but from the opposite tropic began gradually
to resume its vigour.
Some authors would refer, and not without appa
rent reason, the sign Aquarius or the Water-carrier,
to certain old customs connected with the state of

the river at this season, which are said still to main
tain their ground among the natives of Egypt ; and
we shall adduce some evidence from the remains of
egyptian tradition, as well as from the natural history
of the climate, in favour of the plausibility, at least, of
the conjecture.
The inhabitants of the banks of the Nile were
accustomed, as is well known, to depend almost sole
ly on the river water for all purposes to which that
fluid can be applied ; for besides their superstitious
regard for the Nile itself, its stream was considered,
when properly purified and preserved, not only the
most wholesome, but the most invigorating of bever
ages.0 The Egyptians, says Aristides,p are the only
people who preserve water in jars, and calculate its
age as other nations do that of wine. Deguignes
asserts0. on the authority of Arab writers, that during
the months of Tybi and Mechir of the Alexandrian
calendar, a custom prevails in Egypt to this day, of
preparing the vessels and cisterns, and laying in the
supply of drinking water for the season ; the river
having now reached its lowest, and to a certain de
gree stationary condition, and its stream being per
fectly pure, and unadulterated by alluvio of any kind.
The months Tybi and Mechjr of the alexandrian year,
correspond to Choiak and Tybi of the ancient calen
dar, which we are now endeavouring to elucidate.
The chief of the emblems which we have conjectured
to represent the month Choiak on the zodiac, the
crocodile, is closely connected with the water of the
Nile ; and the festivals mentioned by the ancients as

celebrated during this month Tybi, however obscure
their precise meaning, all bear reference to something
peculiar in the state of the river, and most probably
to the lowness of its waters ; and one of them alludes
most unequivocally to the very custom mentioned by
De Guignes. On the seventh day of the month
Tybi, says Plutarch,1 they bake cakes with the figure
of an hippopotamus bound, stamped on them ; and
in the city of Apollinopolis, the whole day was de
voted to hunting the Crocodile ; when having de
stroyed as many as they were able, they feasted on
them in great ceremony before the temple ; it being
incumbent on every person, on that day, to taste the
flesh of this animal. The above ceremonies there is little
reason to doubt were in honour of the river to which
these animals were peculiar. On the eleventh day
of Tybi, we learn from Epiphanius," it was customary
for every Egyptian to draw a certain quantity of
water from the Nile. This ceremony the worthy
father supposes to contain some mysterious reference
to our Saviour's miracle of converting water into
wine, but it bears sufficient marks of pagan origin ;
and suggests at once the idea of Aquarius, the sign of
the zodiac for the season. May not the fable, that
during the reign of one of the early kings of Egypt, the
Nile flowed eleven days with honey, figurative of the
sweetness and excellence of its waters,' be connected
with the above number of the day of the month, to
which this rite was attached. According to Mr.
Salt," the emblem of the river itself, was a figure

crowned with lotus, pouring water, precisely similar
to the figure of Aquarius on the greco-egyptian zodi
acs, which we may therefore presume to have been a
personification of the Nile in its lowest state, when
the value of its waters rendered them an especial
object of superstitious veneration, though of a different
nature from that attached to them during the inun
dation. Champollion has also given in his Pantheon*
a figure of Ammon in the character of Nilus, pouring
water out of a vase. In the hieroglyphic inscriptions,
we sometimes find three vases assigned the river god as an attribute, sometimes only one.w The first
number is an emblem of the inundation, as we learn from Horapollo ;x any thing thrice repeated denoting
abundance or a great quantity of the object.7 The
single vase probably refers to the lowest state of the
river. It is well known that the vases for filtering
or preserving the Nile water, called Canopi by the
Greeks, played a distinguished part in the egyptian
mythology." Immediately below the group of the

his vocabulary, the word NOTB—either, I presume, as supposing that
Horapollo's text is incorrect, or that the two words are synonymous. Be
that as it may, NOTN certainly is a pure Coptic word denoting a flood or
mass of waters; and as such occurs frequently in the Coptic version of

Concerning this month or its name no observa

month, it was customary to fumigate and purify the
temples and sanctuaries. If he be right, it might
give the etymology of the name, as Amshir in Egyp
tian means a censer, or oblation of incense. Being,
however, here destitute of any guide to our re
searches, we shall pass on to the next month, which
will afford more pointed illustrations of our views.

The sense of this word is obvious ; namely the
month of Amon or Amen, the patron deity of Thebes,
whose name evidently constitutes its principal ele

or with the prefix, Phamenoth,* which means literally
dedicated or devoted to Amon. It corresponds still
more closely to the proper names of private individu
als, Phamenothes, or Amenothes," common in papyri,

this being evidently the month of the chief of the

Amon, ruler or director of the gods ; identified by
the Greeks with their Jupiter.
There seems among many nations, at whatever
period of the seasons the civil commencement of their
year may be fixed, to be a natural tendency to date its
first month, in an astronomical sense, from the vernal
equinox ; as the epoch when the sun, having renewed
his vigour, completely overcomes the ascendency of
the lower hemisphere, and advances rapidly towards
the zenith. This may account for the Egyptians
having dedicated this month by preference, to the
prince of their pantheon, Amon Ra, himself an em
blem of the luminary, and whose hieroglyphical sym
bol, it is scarcely necessary to observe, was a Ram,g
the sign of this division of the zodiac ; thereby in
vesting him with the supremacy of their astronomical
calendar, while Thot presided over that in civil use.
There can be little doubt, but that the practice of
counting the signs from Aries was originally an egyp

tian custom, which only became general among the
Europeans in later ages ; for the more ancient Greeks,
on their first adoption and use of the zodiac, seem to
have adapted its signs to their civil calendar, reckon
ing from Cancer, as the commencement of their own olympian year.h That the other was the peculiarly
egyptian arrangement, we are led to conjecture from
its own internal evidence ; but besides this, Theon of
Alexandria, an author sufficiently well versed in the
mythological astronomy of Egypt, positively asserts
it to have been so. In his commentary on a passage
of Aratus, where that poet in enumerating the signs
begins with Cancer, he observes :1 " But why does he
begin with Cancer, while the Egyptians always reckon
from the sign of the Ram ? because it is his usual
practice to reckon from the north, and Cancer is the
most northerly sign ; but the Egyptians with equal
reason commence from the Ram, arrang-ino- their
emblems according to the analogy of their physical
qualities. ' Hence, say they, the Ram is the chief, as
being by nature princely and commanding, since the
Ram is leader and guide of the flock ; as also because
in this sign the equinox takes place."
Plutarch1" informs us, that on the first day of Pha
menoth they celebrated the " entrance of Osiris into
the moon," as being, 'iccgog bgx/i, " the beginning of
spring" (according to the sense of the expression
as referred to the vulgar idiom.) The first part of
this description is not very intelligible ; there can
however be little doubt, from the second, but that

the feast here alluded to was nothing more than an
ancient solemnity first instituted in honour of the
vernal equinox, or first day of Jupiter's month ;
which remaining, like other rites, attached to the
month, and not to the sign, may have been confound
ed or misunderstood by Plutarch. This appears to be
proved by the circumstance that the expression iagos
ugy/i, here used by that author, commonly denotes
with astronomers, not literally the commencement of
the season called spring, but the vernal equinox itself,
the chief point or acme of the season. So Theon :1

We may trace a connexion between this name and

the title of a female personage of some celebrity among
the ancient expounders of egyptian mythology.
That the month Pharmouthi took its name from
this divinity, has occurred to Jablonski," who has,

however, assigned a character to herself, and an ety
mology to her name, neither of which appear very
plausible, namely, EPMOTT, causing death, or with
the article 0EPMOYT, Thermouthis, the causer or
goddess of death ; identifying her with Hecate or Tith
rambo, an evidence which ought, in reason, to lead to
a conclusion the reverse of that which he has formed.
Epiphanius, in treating of egyptian superstition, ob
serves, that " some are initiated into the mysteries of
Tithrambo, who is also called Hecate, others into
those of Nephthys, others into those of Thermouthis ;"
whence the learned critic infers, that Tithrambo or
Hecate, and Thermouthis, are the same, apparently
because it suited his argument ; but the sense of the
passage leads to the more just inference, that they
were different, as an express distinction is made be
tween their rites.
Tn the existing remains of hieroglyphic antiquity,
there occurs no distinct proper name of a divinity re
sembling Hermouthis or Thermouthis ; but there is a
familiar title so nearly corresponding to it, as to leave
little doubt but that it is the same, considered by the
Greeks as that of a separate goddess, namely, MOTT,
mother ; or commonly with the epithet 2CEP mighty
prefixed, 2CEPMOYTI, mighty or powerful mother.0
This, with the usual prefix Pha, might give us the name
of the month ; the first letter of the second or longer
name, being a liquid or aspirate of uncertain sound in
the egyptian language, may possibly have been sup
pressed or slurred over in composition, more especi
ally by the Greeks anxious on all occasions to reduce
the pronunciation of foreign tongues to their own

standard of euphony. Among Coptic proper names
we find Patermouthis ;p which, (as in the case of
Paophi, Phamenoth, and other months,) seems to be
merely the same dedicatory compound, applied ac
cording to familiar custom to private individuals ; and
where the pronunciation of the initial radical appears
to have been preserved entire. Without insisting
upon the rigid exactness of this etymology, we may
be permitted to assume, that in whatever way the
name is compounded, it contains the signification of ■
sacred to Mouth, or Zermout ; as Phamenoth con
tains that of sacred to Amon. We shall, in another
place, adduce farther confirmation of this opinion,
from the close connexion between this deity herself,
and those who preside over the months, which pre
cede and follow her own in the calendar.
We find this title of Mouth, Zermout, or Ther
mouthis, applied by the ancients, or appended in the
hieroglyphic inscriptions, to various female person-'
ages of the pantheon, Isis, Neit, Buto ; who thus be- !
come more especially invested with the attributes of
maternity or female productiveness.q The principal

4 We have seen (supra, p. 95.) that Plutarch mentions Mont, which
word is rendered by himself mother, among, the titles of Isis, that is, of
the female essence of the egyptian divinity in general. This is confirmed
by jElian, (Hist. Anim. x. 22.), who also observes (x. 31.) that a parti
cular species of snake, one of the sacred emblems of Isis, and her favour
ite head ornament, was called Thermouthis. Horapollo assigns the same
character to Neit (Minerva), as he informs us that a vulture was the
emblem of both that deity and of the idea mother. (Hierogl. i. c. 1 1, 1 2.)
Eusebius (Prsep. Ev. 1. iii. c. 11.) states that Isis was also so represented.
In M. Champollion's Pantheon the title Mout or Zermout (Thermouthis)
is applied to various other female deities.
According to Josephus (Ant. Jud. II. ix. 5), the Pharaoh's daughter
who saved Moses from the waters of the Nile, was called Thermouthis ;



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. III. 113
component part of the hieroglyphic name is a vulture,
the sign of the idea mother.1 In fact, this mysterious
idol appears to have been merely a symbol of the ma
ternal essence or principle of the creation, the mother
or mighty mother of the world. She was considered
as the wife of Ammon, whom we find invested with
the character of male generative principle, or Priapus.
Horapollo8 asserts that the Bull of the zodiac was
consecrated to a female deity whom he calls the
Moon ; a description not incompatible with the vari
ed properties of Mout. According to the unani
mous testimony of antiquity, the moon was aginvodijXvg in the egyptian cosmogony ;l that is, one of those
physical objects of the creation which partook both of
the male and female essence. Thermouthis also fre
quently appears with very unequivocal marks of the
double sex." " The moon was considered female," says Plutarch,v " as impregnated through her junction
with the sun, male as herself redistributing the same
generative or creative principles throughout the
which may have been either a title of honour peculiar to herself, or as
sumed according to the prevailing fashion in honour of some favourite
deity. Heliodorus, however, in his romance (iEthiop. 1. i. p. 54, sqij.)
gives the same name to a man, with whom, as a professed warrior or sol
dier of fortune, it may have borne reference to Neith as goddess of war,
if indeed she can be so considered in the egyptian pantheon. This, how
ever, might still farther corroborate what has been observed in the text
concerning the sex of the divinity. One of the branches of the Nile,
called Thermuthiac or Pharmuthiac by Ptolemy, (Geogr. IV. 5.) and
Pharmuthis, a small town of the Delta, also, it may be presumed, derived
their name from this deity. r Champol. Precis du syst. hier. p. 122.

sacred to the moon. On the greco-egyptian zodiacs,

disk of the moon between his horns. Eusebius," it
may be added, asserts that the moon in one of her fe
male characters was personified by a goddess with the
head of a vulture, which bird we have already seen
was the symbol of Mout, or Mother. This mysteri
ous union of the two luminaries, to whom these two
contiguous months, Phamenoth, Pharmouthi, were
respectively dedicated, namely, Ammon, the male
principle of the sun, and Mout, the female essence of
the moon, may possibly be hinted at in the obscure
fable of the passage of Plutarch, quoted in the preced

Pachon, (Gemini.)
This word, which among the Copts admits of con
siderable variety of orthography, Pachon, Pachons, Pashons ;b denotes literally the month of Chon, or
Chons, the egyptian Hercules, whose name occurs in
the ancient authors under corresponding varieties.
From the Etymologicum magnum0 we have, " Chon ; among the Egyptians Hercules ;" and Champolliond
has identified the name Chons accompanying the
figure of the god on the monuments. The same is
common as an element of the appellations of indivi
duals in the papyri, and other inscriptions ; as Pete
chonsis, Psenchonsis, Devoted to Chons, Son of Chons, &c.e In the list of theban kings given by
Eratosthenes, the name of this deity occurs under the
form of Som or Sem, as an element of that of king
Semphoucrates, or Hercules Harpocrates, according
to the greek translation appended to it ; and in Ma
netho's twenty-third dynasty, in a note attached to
the name of king Psammus, it is said that he was
called by the Egyptians Hercules. This, deducting
the greek termination, is the same word with the ar
ticle prefixed/ Hence there can be no doubt, as has

been often observed by egyptian antiquaries/ but tbat
this name Chon or Chons, under its numerous varie
ties, is originally no other than the Coptic radical
2£OM, or 2CHN2,—strength or power;" the sound
of the first letter of the word being, as we have seen
above, uncertain, or such as cannot be conveyed ex
actly in the idiom of any foreign language, but par
taking it would appear of the varieties of guttural,
aspirate, and sibilant.
The reasons which have induced me to assign this
position in the year to Pachon, or the first water
month according to the hieroglyphic, have been given
above ; and in still farther corroboration of them, it
will be easy to show how closely its patron deity was
connected with this season in the egyptian mythology.
If any attention be due, on the one hand, to the
joint testimony of Eudoxus and Horapollo,1—on the other hand, to that of Solon and Plato, k two among
the sages of Greece who are supposed to have been
most intimately acquainted with the doctrines of the

rapollo ;m—the most ancient recorded doctrine of that
fraternity respecting the rise of the Nile was twofold ;
the phenomenon being ascribed, partly to the rains of
^Ethiopia, partly to an ebullition or oozing of water
from the lower parts of the earth, a peculiar blessing
bestowed by the gods on their favourite land, for the
purpose of fertilizing its soil, without exposing it to
those natural convulsions, or other calamities, to
which, according to the same priests, all countries
were subject that were dependant on the water of
their own atmosphere alone for the moistening or ir
rigation of their fields.
• It will be seen, then, with what propriety the first,
and as it were laborious, augmentation of the waters
of the river, was dedicated to Hercules ; who was in
the egyptian mysteries the active or physical power of
the deity, or of nature ; Virtus deorum," AvvufAig r^g

cisely corresponding to the above epithets, in the
name of the city of Sebennytus, called by the

rally Strength or Power of God ; and that it really
was the sacred city of Hercules, may be inferred from
the circumstance, that on the greek and roman coins
of Sebennytus,' the common device is a figure of Mars
or of Hercules, (these two deities being one with the

man armed at all points. And we hear1 of a native
author, Apollonides, also called Horapius, (probably
the same as the celebrated Horapollo), who wrote a
work under the same title of Semnuthis, in which he
described the exploits of the gods against the giants.
That the title of the work was the same as that of the
god, appears from Macrobius in the passage already
alluded to, where Hercules is described as the power
of the gods (virtus deorum) by which they overcame
the giants. Ipse creditur et gigantes interemisse, cum
caelo propugnaret, quasi Virtus deorum. The prin
ciple of drought, or unwholesome aridity, was a chief
element of the Typhon of the physical world, of
whose evil influences the giants were considered as
personifications. To these the principle of moisture,
figurative of the waters of the Nile, or the vapours
arising from them, was in perpetual hostility. Dio
dorus expressly invests the egyptian Hercules with
the power of controlling or influencing the inunda tion of the Nile ;s of this we have also traces in the
fables,' apparently of native origin, where that hero,
when afflicted with thirst in crossing the deserts of
Lybia, is relieved, by Minerva according to some,
according to others by Jupiter in the form of a ram,
that is Ammon ;' who suddenly caused tepid springs
to issue from the bowels of the earth for his supply.
A figure of Hercules striking the ground, from
whence issues forth a stream of water, is common on
egyptian medals."

The Twins, emblems of this season on the zodiac,
have at first sight no apparent connexion with the my
thology of Egypt; but most of my readers will probably
be aware, that one of these twins, the Pollux of the Greeks, is called on the arab zodiac Hercules ;T and
one of the two most brilliant stars of the constellation was also named Hercules by the Greeks ;w which
star, as well as the twin to whom it belongs, is still
called Hercules on our globes. There exists, more
over a fragment of an egyptio-greek zodiac, sculp
tured on marble, and which has been frequently en
graved and illustrated,31 where the sign of Gemini
is occupied by two figures, one of whom, the largest
and most prominent, is the greek Hercules with his club ;
the person of the other lesser figure has no such dis
tinctive marks, but appears to be a female. On the zo
diac of Dendera, the constellation Gemini is also repre
sented by two figures, the one male, and the other
female.y The latter has the head of a lion, which pecu
liarity, it is well known, belongs to an egyptian goddess,
whose name M. Champollion2 has identified as Tafne.
The same distinguished critic, in his first letter on the
museum of Turin* has observed, that this very lion
headed goddess, whom he considers as a personifica
tion of the attributes of Neit, in her character of
Minerva bellica, the defensive deity of Egypt, " ap

associated under the name of Tafne to the egyptian
Hercules." This god therefore ought to be her
companion in the sphere ; and in fact on the quad
rangular zodiac of Denderah, he appears in his place
in the same attire as the figure of the god Chon
given in the Pantheon of the french author." This
fact concludes a chain of circumstantial evidence,
which can leave no reasonable doubt, respecting the
original connexion between the month Pachon and
the zodiacal sign of the Twins ; while it shows, that
the constructors of the egyptio-greek astronomical
monuments of later times, have, in some instances,
adhered with much fidelity to the pristine mythology
of the banks of the Nile ; of this, equally striking
examples will occur in the following months.
M. Champollion's opinion, that Tafne, as an atten
dant on Hercules, was a personification of Neith or
Minerva, appears to be justified by the close connex
ion which we find between that goddess and her com
panion, in the vulgar mythology. Of this we have
already given an example ; another occurs in the
orphic poems, which contain so many mysterious al
lusions to egyptian fable ; where we are told that
Hercules was conducted up to heaven by Pallas :
b Pl. 25. See our Plate III. No. 5, conf. No. 4, sup. cit. In Champol
lion's Pantheon the figure of the god is seated. I have therefore only
copied the head, to show the identity with the zodiacal deity. This the
feather that crowns his cap sufficiently establishes, being observable on
the head of the same god, in the tableau general of the Precis du syst. hier.
of the french critic, (No. 71.) while Chons, or Hercules, is the only male
deity, either in that collection, in the Pantheon of the same author, or
on the zodiac, distinguished by this ornament.
Mons. C. has offered in his Precis the variety Soou of the name of this
god. I know not on what authority it rests ; but if genuine, it might be
connected with a corresponding variety in the name of the month, given
by Tuki, nATT/HEXS, which the critics have usually considered as an
error of impression for nAHJUNS.

This harmonizes aptly enough with the position of
the two figures on the zodiacs, where with joined
hands they occupy their place in the midst of the
celestial train.
The custom of associating deities in pairs, as to
especial points of worship or of attribute, like the
trvvvocoi ^tiot of the Greeks, is familiar in egyptian su
perstition. It is obvious, how naturally the Greeks,
in transferring this figurative couple to their own
pantheon, might metamorphose them into their own
national twins, Castor and Pollux.
In mentioning above, the correspondence of the
opinion of Zoega respecting the ancient form of the
egyptian year, with that which I have here ventured
to offer, I observed, that I had been led to suspect,
that among the reasons which had induced him to
adopt it, were some not dissimilar to those here ad
vanced. In confirmation of that remark, I shall quote
the following passage from his work on the medals of
the Borgian Museum. In a note to a coin of Sebennytus,d where, as already stated, we have for device a
figure of Hercules, or a man armed at all points, he
observes : " The name of this city has been excellent
ly interpreted by Jablonski, 2CEMNOTTI, Robur
Dei, the power of the divinity. It would appear,
that in the egyptian mythology there were two chil
dren of Jove, whether called Cabiri, Patseci, Hercules,
Martes, or Castores, matters not ; for they all sprung
originally from the same source. The essential point

12°2 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
is, that by two vigorous youths, sometimes represented
with joined hands side by side, at others posted by
the throne of the deity, was figured the arm of the
Almighty, the protecting and all-conquering power
or virtue of the divinity. Hence, according to Hesychius,e yiyvSv, yiym' Tlocraixog iTirgxTifyog' AiyvTrioig
'HgaxKTjg' hence the Patseci and Cabiri of Herodotus,
who, when he rejects the Dioscuri from the egyptian
mythology, must be understood to refer to the lace
dsemonian Castores, not the celestial Twins. For
those deities who in the old egyptian cosmogony were called Cabirif or Nidsjom, (NI2COM) the same,
in their heroic fable, were styled Horus and Harpo
crates ; the latter corresponds to the Hercules of the
Greeks, the former to their Mars. But Horus being
conjoined with Aroeris became their Apollo, where
fore, in the egyptio-greek zodiac we find Hercules
and Apollo combined." These observations, inexact
as some of them may be, are yet fraught with the
genius of the profound and acute critic from whom
they emanate. Zoega being convinced, that 2COM
or Hercules was the representative of the twins
of the zodiac, could not, had he treated of the cal
endar on the basis proposed by himself, of a year
commencing in autumn, have failed to observe, how

theory would have been correct ; for in fact, as we
have already seen, and shall still farther prove in the
sequel, Chons and his companion of the lion's head
were the true Cabiri, or essential personifications,
male and female, of strength or power, in the egyp

bable, that some other male deity of lesser rank, si
milar to the one whom he describes, may occasionally
have occupied the place of Tafne by the side of Chons ;
since, on the sphere of the Arabs,8 who in this in
stance have no doubt copied more or less accurately
from the greco-egyptian astrology, the Twins are to
this day Hercules and Apollo ; which variety has
been adopted on our globes ; and appears on the
ancient images of the zodiac illustrated by Grotius ;
these names having been also preferred by several of
the classical commentators.11

of the year ; hence its dedication by preference to
the splendid orb itself, which influenced and reign

124 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
On, as we know from Scripture, was an ancient name of the godhead of the Sun.k Hence Pharaoh's
officer Petephre, or Potiphera, whose name means
literally in the coptic language dedicated or devoted
to the Sun,1 is called by MosesTM priest of On. Al
though in the existing remains of that tongue, there
is little appearance of the name having been in fami
liar use, yet Cyril" knew it as an egyptian word ; and
there are plentiful traces of its application to the Sun
in a religious or mysterious sense at least. The true
appellation of the city of the Sun, called by the Greeks
Heliopolis, was On, or the city of On ; a name it has
retained in the coptic language ;° whence it may be
presumed, that, in the above mentioned passage of
Genesis, the term applies as well to the place of the
deity's worship as to himself; corresponding to the
version of the Copts, where it is rendered f2N
TIBAKI, and by the Septuagint ' HKiovToKig.v The
same city seems to have been styled by Ptolemy the
metropolis of On ;q and the Arabs still call it Ain
shemsh, or Ain of the sun ;r although the first part of
this name, from its resemblance to another word in
their own language denoting a fountain, they have
referred to a spring among the ruins of the city.
Plutarch8 informs us, that the priest of Heliopolis,
under whom Pythagoras studied, was called Onou

phis ; which is evidently nN-OTII, devoted or de
dicated to On or the Sun ; by the same analogy as
Amenoph, sacred to Amon, and other similar titles ;
and is in fact nearly synonymous with Petephre, the
name of the same minister in the days of Joseph.
Onouphis was also a title of one of the sacred oxen
of the Sun.1 The Coptic for light is to this day OEIN
or OTONI," which is doubtless merely the same
word under slight varieties of orthography, the last
of which corresponds, in respect to the euphonic pa
ragoge of the last vowel, to that adopted in the name of the month. In the hebrew Aven, which Ezekielv
uses for On, we have a similar variety of the pronun
ciation of the first syllable. The word Phe-on, the
article being prefixed, occurs on the gems of the Ba
silidians, as an appellation of their Abraxas, or Sun
god, in common with Phre, Chnoubis, and others
borrowed from the mythology of Egypt.1" The name
Ouenephre, in Manetho's first dynasty, appears to
contain both those of the deity combined ; it might
be rendered Lux solis.*
The sign of this season on the greek zodiac is a
crab ; an unmeaning emblem as referred to egyptian
mythology. But on the greater number of egyptio
greek astronomical monuments, we find a scarabee

instead of a crab,y as the emblem of the solstitial
month ; and it is hardly necessary to observe, that the
scarabee is the symbol of the Sun, or On, in his no
blest capacity, as Lord of the universe, first source
and origin, and continual preserver of the created
world. In this respect the scarabee was a represen
tative, not only of the solar orb itself, but by analogy
of certain deities of distinguished rank, whose loftier
attributes comprehended those of the brilliant Lord
of the physical world ; as of Phtha,2 the Demiurgus
or creative power, whom the Greeks identified with
their Hephsestus or Vulcan, probably as combining
with his other properties that of god of fire. In the
ancient astronomical picture of the tomb of the kings,
the scarabee, with the red disk of the sun in his claws,
occupies a conspicuous place among the zodiacal em
blems. The same insect also occurs in an astrologi
cal gem of Count Pahlen's collection," accompanying
Libra and Scorpio ; and we seem to have farther cu
rious evidence, that it was the original symbol of this
division of the ancient egyptian zodiac, in the circum
stance, that the cypher of the same division, still in
vulgar use, is apparently but an abbreviated form of
the hieroglyphic " Scarabee ;" the hieratic contrac
tion of which contains precisely the same elements,
under trifling varieties of arrangement, as the modern
sign, namely, two curves or hooks placed trans
versely.5
y On the quadrangular zodiac of Denderah, and one of those of Esne,
(Desc. de l'Eg. Antiq. v. i. pl. 87.) we have the Scarabee ; on another
of Esne, an animal of doubtful form (ibidem, pl. 79.) ; on the circular of
Denderah, apparently a crab.

The Greeks, in adopting the zodiac, may either
have mistaken this insect for a crab, to which on
some of the monuments it bears a close enough re
semblance ;e and on the gems of the Abraxas the sca
rabee, crab, and other shell-fish, are frequently con
founded ;d or possibly, as they did not attach the same
veneration as the Egyptians to its symbolic character,
they may have converted the reptile of the land into
the reptile of the sea, as a figure more congenial to
their ideas and taste as a maritime people ; " A per
son ignorant of egyptian theology," says Porphyry,
" would feel nothing but disgust for the scarabee, but the Egyptians adore it as the living image of the Sun."e
The opposite character of this nation, whose abomi
nation of every thing connected with salt water is
proverbial/ were in itself sufficient proof, in the ab
sence of all other, that this odious shell-fish could ne
ver have originally obtained so distinguished a place
among the noblest of their figurative emblems.
There is however in one respect a remarkable
enough analogy between the two symbols, which may
tend still farther to shew, that the one is the egyptian
original, the other the greek copy. Classical authors
have asserted that the crab was chosen to represent
the solstice, because of the correspondence of its pro
verbially retrograde motion to the sun's course about
the tropic f an interpretation which has been adopted
c I have myself observed persons little familiar with egyptian monu
ments, on being shewn hieroglyphic drawings, mistake the scarabee for a
crab. d Mont. Ant. expL t. ii. pt. ii. p- 365, and plates ibid.

by the greater number of modern expositors, with
what degree of justice I shall not presume positively
to decide. This however, we find, is the very same
reason given by the ancients, and among others by Clemens Alexandrinush in the famous passage on
hieroglyphic symbols so often quoted, for the scarabee
having been adopted by the egyptian mystics as a re
presentative of the sun's motion. " The oblique
course of the other heavenly bodies," says the learned
father, " is represented by a snake, but that of the
sun by a scarabee." Those who are familiar with the
natural history of this singular animal, or who have
ever observed its habits, will not be at a loss to divine
the reason. Clemens himself assigns it : " because,
shaping a piece of dung into a circular form, he rolls
it backwards, his face being turned in a contrary di
rection to his course." And Plutarch :1 " The scara
bee depositing his seed in a piece of dung made into
a circular form, rolls it backwards, as the sun appears
to turn the heavens round in a contrary direction, himself being borne from west to east." Porphyry :k
" The scarabee making a piece of dung into a round
ball, pushes it with his hind legs backwards, as the sun
does the heaven." Here therefore we have the sca
rabee, with his globe, as an emblem of the retrograde
motion of the sun ; probably both as regards his sup
posed annual course from west to east, contrary to his
diurnal motion from east to west ; and his retrograde
motion from the solstice. This beetle is a very sin
gular insect, although its peculiarities, which are of a

striking enough description, and a proper knowledge
of which is of the highest importance to the study of
egyptian antiquity, have been strangely overlooked
by those who have devoted their attention to that
study. The scarabee, in conformity to the above
authorities, as an eye-witness can attest, shaping a
piece, usually of horse, mule, or cow dung, into a
perfectly circular form, turns himself on his fore claws,
so as to stand as it were on his head, and with his
hind claws raised against his ball, he thus pushes it
before, or rather behind him, in the most indefatiga
ble manner, until he reaches his destination. This is
the chief, and indeed reasonable cause, why the egyp
tians attached so great a sanctity to the animal, as the
symbol of the divinity or godhead of the sun, whose
globe he is generally represented on the monuments
holding in his claws. Another motive of a secondary
nature may have been the circumstance, also alluded
to by classical authors, and well known to naturalists,
that the animal depositing its eggs in this ball, buries
it several feet deep in the earth, where, as in a na,>
tural womb, the foetus ripens for the birth. In this
respect, his globe might also be symbolic of the all
generative powers of the luminary. As for the other
traditions concerning it,1 such as that the species was
composed entirely of males, that they dwelt six months
below, and six months above ground, they may be
partly founded on fact, partly mere fictions of sophists,
egyptian or greek.01

Epiphi, (Leo),
Is written by the Copts Epep, EIIHn f a name which
has also been identified by M. Champollion in pho
netic hieroglyphics, attached to the figure of an egyp
tian divinity, called by him0 " Apap—Apop—Apoph,
represented under the form of a gigantic snake, com
batted and covered with wounds by various deities,.
This is the Apophis, or Apopis, the enemy of the sun,
whom Plutarch mentions in his treatise on Isis and
Osiris." Plutarchp farther observes, that Apopis was
the brother of the sun, which may account, among
other causes, for his proximity to him in the calendar.
It may be observed, that of the hieroglyphic elements
of this and other egyptian names, the consonants alone
are of importance ; the vowel which M. Champollion renders A denotes equally E,q and consequently ap
plies as well to the coptic orthography as to that of
Plutarch.
Jablonski1 has rightly supposed this Apophis to be
one of the personifications of Typhon, the evil genius ;
and that by his enmity to the Sun was figured the
principle of vapour or darkness, which was fabled to
oppose the god of light in his efforts to ascend, or
maintain himself in the upper hemisphere. His po

sition in the seasons, according to the general tenor
of the physical mythology of Egypt, is therefore high
ly appropriate ; as presiding over the month, in which
the sun, after having reigned in all his glory about
the tropic, descends visibly and rapidly in the ecliptic.
The etymology, or rather original meaning of the
name, suggested by the same Jablonski,8 to whose la
bours Coptic literature and egyptian antiquity in ge
neral are so much indebted, appears unquestionable ;
namely, A4>O0 or EllfiO, a giant, in the scriptu
ral sense of the term ; a violent and outrageous per
son. The same occurs under the variety of Aphobis,
as the appellation of one of the Shepherd kings in
Manetho's dynasty ;' that the Egyptians were accus
tomed to confer titles of reproach or abhorrence on
their tyrants, or foreign oppressors, is well known ;
thus the ferocious Ochus was called by them the

That the Lion was the egyptian symbol of this sea
son there can be no doubt, as it occurs on all the as
tronomical monuments, including that of the royal
tomb. But that it was so, not alone, but combined
with the emblem of the month or god Apophis or
Epep, we have very convincing proof. M. Champollion,v as already observed, has identified a large noxi
ous serpent as the personification of this deity ; and
on the greco-egyptian zodiacs the figure of the Lion
is remarkable for the peculiarity, that it tramples upon

a monstrous snake, which forms as it were the boat
in which he is borne on his celestial voyage." Now
the same distinguished antiquary has also discovered
among the monuments, and caused to be engraved
in his pantheon," a group consisting of a female
deity with a lion's head crowned with the disk of
the Sun, who combats and tramples upon this same
serpent, standing over him in an attitude not dissimi
lar to that of the Lion on the zodiac ; the head and
tail of the reptile which she grasps, rising in front and
rear. This deity M. Champollion calls Neith Casti
gatrice ; the snake he has recognised as Apophis.
His description of the senigma, as illustrative of our
subject, requires little comment. " Sa tete de lion
est ornee du disque et de l'urseus ; elle saisit de ses
deux mains, et foule en meme temps aux pieds, une
enorme couleuvre, le grand serpent ennemi des dieux
nomme Apop, ou Apoph, dans les textes
hieroglyphiques." In the hieroglyphic legend attach
ed to the figure, the most remarkable emblems are
the disk of the sun, an eye, and the forepart of a lion.
According to M. Champollion's interpretation, she is
there described as: oeil du soleil, souveraine de la
force, chatiant les impurs. It cannot be doubted,
but that this group and Leo of the zodiac, are mere
ly varieties of the same senigma. In the zodiacal em
blem, it may also be remarked, that the figure of the
lion is supported, and as it were backed and encour
aged, by a female deity ; which is evidently but an

other type of the mystical combination of the two in
the monument of Champollion.
This is a noble enough symbol of the combat be
tween the powers of light, and the typhonic influences
by which they were assailed at this season ; and still
farther illustrates the connexion already pointed out,
between the lion-headed heroine, and Chons or Her
cules. He was the especial representative of the
strength or prowess of the gods, whereby they sub
dued the giants. The lion's head was the egyptian
symbol of strength/ The war therefore between his
comrade, and the giant Apoph, is quite in character.
The disk of the sun on her head denotes the strength
of the Sun. Macrobius, in the following passage of
his Saturnalia,2 while treating of the character of the
Sun in the egyptian astrological fable, appears to de
scribe this point of physical superstition to the letter.
" Ipse creditur et Gigantes interemisse, cum ccelo

epithet of Horus. His name appears written hierb,>
glyphically, Or-si-esi, on the margin of the circular
Planisphere of Dendera, immediately below the image
of the mother herself, whose position among the figu
rative characters of that monument shall be pointed
out immediately. The same epithet indeed, with the
addition occasionally of the father Osiris, is an almost
invariable appendage of the name of Horus in hiero
glyphic inscriptions ; in that of Rosetta it is never
omitted, and is also very familiar in both ancient and
modern egyptian literature, as a human appellation,
transferred like others from the god to the mortal.*
The Isis of the egyptian pantheon represented, in
her highest and noblest capacity, the essence of the
female godhead ; hence, according to the principles
of that system, we find her name or familiar qualities
frequently mixed, up or confounded with those of
other lesser goddesses, Buto, Bubastis, Neit, Athor,
who were in fact little more than personifications of
her varied attributes. But here she appears in that
character which belonged exclusively to her original
and distinct person, namely, as the mother of Horus
or the good genius of the earth, perpetual enemy and
victor of Typhon, and other noxious influences of the
physical world. This was the season in which the
inundation of the river became stationary, or even
beginning to subside, deposited its fertilizing alluvio
on the plain ; hence the probable motive of dedicat
ing it to the parent deity of the terrestrial riches
and prosperity of the land of Egypt, allegorized in the
person of her son Horus.
From the' remnants of egyptian antiquity may be

136 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
gathered various proofs of the correctness of the above
etymology, as well as of the fact, that Isis was fabled
to have produced Horus at this season, in the primi
tive tradition. This goddess, according to the unani
mous testimony of the ancients, denoted physically
the earth fertilized by the inundation of the Nile ;
Osiris her husband, the Nile, or the inundation itself. Thus Heliodorus :h " Isis is mystically the earth,
Osiris the Nile ;" and Plutarch :s " The Nile is
Osiris, who is united with Isis, that is, the earth ;"
for " the body of Isis is not the whole earth, but
that portion of it which is impregnated through its
coition with the Nile. The issue of this union is
Horus," the emblem of the fertility and wealth of
Egypt. Isis was the primeval matter, the slime or soil, which, according to Jamblichus,k contained in
itself the generative or nutritive faculty, that is, " the
capability of receiving or containing the river of
generation." This river was Osiris, the male prin
ciple, and emblem of the Nile. It is impossible to
overlook the evident connexion which all this esta
blishes between Horus, the offspring of Isis, and the
fertility produced by the rich alluvial deposit of the
river at this season.
Some, however, have held the infant Horus and
Harpocrates to be the same ; and as we have already
shown the latter to have been produced about the
winter solstice, that opinion, if admitted, would very
much interfere with our present views. I shall not

mythological, which offer themselves respecting the
names and properties of these two figurative beings ;
but merely observe, that although they were very
closely connected, and, in fact, little more than two
varied personifications of the same deity, it is yet
very certain that there is a marked difference in their
attributes, however those attributes may have been
blended or confounded by superficial authors. This
difference has been well pointed out by Plutarch,1
who has given us the history of these mythological
persons, both parent and offspring, in great detail,
find who makes Horus and Harpocrates brothers,
both sons of Isis ; the one born during the life of
Osiris, the other after his death ; which corresponds
exactly to our account of the matter. Osiris, as the
living husband of Isis, was the Nile in all its glory
at the inundation, when Horus was born ; Osiris
dead is, as we have seen, Osiris at the winter solstice,
when the Nile was nearly at the lowest, and when,
as we have shown in our account of that season,
Harpocrates was born. The last is said by PlutarchTM
to have been produced " out of season, and mutilated
in his lower members."" The other is called by the
same author " Horus, symmetrical and perfect."*
Here we find an equally positive and apt allusion to
their two characters, according to the two seasons.
The emblem of the deity at the winter solstice was
represented mutilated, because of the defective state
of the river, besides the figurative lameness or em

barrassment of the course of the sun at that season.
The perfect season, represented by a perfect emblem,
was the full inundation of the Nile.
Plutarch, having informed us that Horus was the
issue of the connexion between Osiris and Isis at the
inundation, continues : " But this Horus is the pre
serving and nourishing property of the atmosphere,
fostered in the marshes about the city of Buto, be
cause the land, flooded and irrigated, chiefly emits
those vapours, which are opposed to the influences of
drought and aridity."1" These last were the Typhon,
against whom Horus waged war. " By Typhon,"
says the same author,"1 " they signify every thing dry
or fiery that promotes aridity, or is opposed to mois
ture ;" and accordingly in another place,1 he states,
that " Isis nourished Horus with exhalations and
vapours, whereby gaining strength, he was enabled to
obtain the mastery of Typhon." Here then we have
Horus, born when . the inundation was at its height,
nursed and fostered among the vapours which rose
from the water, gradually subsiding and retiring from
the land. Hence it is that the infant deity is so often
represented sitting on a lotus flower, the hieroglyphi
cal emblem of the season of his childhood ; and pos
sibly the juvenile figure, which, as we have above
noted, is an attendant of Libra or Thot on both
funereal and astronomical monuments, may contain
an allusion to the childhood or fostering of Horus

Nigidius, an old roman commentator of the egyp
tian sphere, gives us to understand, as quoted by
Servius,' that Horus was born or nursed under the
sign Virgo, which corresponds to this month in our
calendar. The symbol so called by the Greeks, there
can be no doubt, as observed by Eratosthenes and
others," originally represented Isis, Ceres, or Deme
ter, being a female figure holding ears of corn in her
hand, which can apply to no other personage of the
greek pantheon ; whence the name of the most cele
brated star of this constellation, Spica virginis. The
constellation Virgo of the greek sphere is of conside
rable extent, and may, in fact, be divided into two,
Virgo and Spica virginis ; as the Arabs call the whole
indiscriminately by both names. But on the greco
egyptian sphere of Denderah, the usual zodiacal sign
of Virgo, namely, a female figure bearing an ear of
corn, is somewhat confined ; immediately below it,
however, is another large female figure, sitting on a
throne, holding a new born infant on her lap ; the
whole precisely similar to the group of Isis in her
character of mother of Horus, so common on medals,
gems, and other monuments/ This group is evi
in the habit of observing new born infants, with whom this is a common
and favourite attitude. The infants Horus and Harpocrates were ac
cordingly both so depicted ; and this seems to be the whole claim of the
latter to the mystical character of god of silence, with which the later
greek and roman mythologists have invested him, and which has become
with modern illustrators of egyptian fable, his chief title to celebrity. i Ad. Virgil. Georg. I. 19.

fore, may be considered as emblematic of the com

Mesori. This was also the view taken of the mean
ing of this group by Mess. Jollois and Devilliers, in
their excellent and comprehensive memoir on the
greco-egyptian zodiacs, inserted in the collection of
the Description de l'Egypte." The same sitting
figure with the infant, they observe, was, though
nearly effaced, distinguishable on the greater zodiac
of the portico of the same ruins. On the persian
sphere, as given by Scaliger/ we find in this sign
" a beautiful young woman, with long hair, bearing
two ears of corn in her hand, sitting on a throne,
and tenderly fostering an infant." And the same
was gathered by Selden2 and Kircher1 from Arabic
or rabbinical authorities, who, after old egyptian
astrologers, describe the sign in precisely similar
terms. Among the relics of egyptio-gnostic supersti

infant, and holding ears of corn in one hand ; on her
forehead a star ; the whole no doubt emblematic of
this season, or Mesori.
The ingenious french memorialists above noticed
were led by their analysis of the monuments which
form the subject of their dissertation0 to conclude,
that Virgo of the egyptian sphere originally consisted
of two different constellations ; the one represented
by the goddess of harvest or productiveness,* the
other by Isis nursing Horus ; which two asterisms
were confounded into one in the sphere of the Greeks.
These judicious remarks, which I quote in corrobora
tion of my own opinion with the greater satisfaction,
that having been made without reference to any sys
tem, they are beyond the suspicion of partiality,
appear to be confirmed, not only by the evidence of
the greco-egyptian monuments, but by that of the
astronomical picture of the theban tomb. In it, as
we have formerly remarked, are two processions ;
the one, whose leader bears an ear of corn or some
thing similar, we have above conjectured to be indi
cative of the position of Spica, between Leo, and Libra
or Thot. The other procession occupies an exactly
parallel position on the opposite side of the picture,
and is apparently a mere duplicate of the first, with
this exception, however, that while its leader wants
the distinctive mark of the ear or branch, the princi
pal feature of the hieroglyphic inscription appended,
and substituted, as it were, for the Spica, is a new

born infant. It has already been remarked, that in
this monument the signs are not arranged in their
usual order, being apparently discomposed and varied
for some mysterious purpose. Yet it were reasonable
to conclude, that these two figures are symbolic of
the sign of this season in a twofold capacity, as at Den
derah, and according to the form which the french
essayists have assigned it on the pristine egyptian
sphere.

SECTION IV.
CONCLUSION OF THE SAME SUBJECT.
The foregoing analysis of the names and characters
of the individual months has, I trust, been sufficient
to justify the reasonableness of our primary hypo
thesis, grounded on the internal evidence of their
hieroglyphic symbols, that the year to which they
were originally adapted commenced in autumn, and
that this pristine arrangement of the civil calendar
coincided with that of the signs of the zodiac, or
corresponding divisions of the astronomical calendar.
I shall now add a few remarks on these months in
general, more especially on those whose positions
stand in immediate relation to the cardinal points of
the tropical year, in order still farther to show the
appropriate nature of their astronomical emblems, as
well as of the proper feasts assigned to each with
respect to their positions.
Thus we find that the first month, or Thot, being
fixed to the season of the year when night obtained
the ascendency of day, the symbols of its patron
deity chosen to represent it were not the most com

mon or familiar, but such as appeared to belong to
him more especially in his character of minister of
Osiris, and superintendent of the transmission of souls
from the upper to the lower regions, in conformity
with the admitted principle of a connexion or analogy
between the egyptian fable relative to the celestial
spheres and that concerning the regions of departed
spirits. Another obvious motive for adopting by pre
ference the scales as the symbol of the month of Thot,
would be the very palpable allusion i$ contains to the
balance of day and night at the equinox. The position
and rites of the month Athyr, a» regards the deity to
whom it was dedicated, and the emblems by which it was
represented, have been amply illustrated above. The
equinoctial month Phamenoth was dedicated to Am
nion, or Amon-ra, whom egyptian mythologists agree"
in supposing to have been a personification of the Sun,
more peculiarly at the vernal equinox, in the character
where he finally triumphs over night, and reassumes
his ascendency in the hemisphere. Again, the month
succeeding the solstice we find devoted to the Sun
himself simply, for reasons already assigned. And
here it will be remarked how appropriately the season
chosen for the mournful rites of their astrological my
thology was that which preceded the winter solstice,
because those lamentations, as we have seen, were
only in character during the visible decline of the so
lar orb ; after he became stationary, or began to re
ascend, all cause of grief or fear was at an end. But
the proper month of the Sun was that which succeed
ed the summer solstice, because, as it is well known,
the god previous to that period does not attain his

greatest power, nor the inundation, supposed to de
pend on his influence, any considerable height.
All this will be found in close harmony with the assertion of Porphyry, Proclus, and others,b that the
more important signs of the egyptian zodiac were no
thing more than figures of the influence of the sun in
various parts of his orbit. The substance of their
statements is condensed into two verses of an epi gram, which, though attributed by Macrobiusd to the
oracle of Apollo Clarius, is evidently a fragment of
the gnostic or basilidian school of mystics, usually
called christian heretics, but who may more properly
be considered a pagan sect, their doctrines being a
fanciful combination of those of the various religions
in vogue under the roman empire, among which were,
as might be expected, many borrowed, or rather cor
rupted, from both judaism and Christianity. But the
sect originated in Egypt, and the basis of its mysteries
was the ancient paganism of that country, as is clearly
evinced by the character of the devices which occur
on the gems and other extant relics of their supersti
tion.6 Their principal deity was the Sun, typified by
various monstrous symbols, partly derived from the
egyptian pantheon, partly the pure fruit of gnostic
imaginations. These are usually accompanied on the
monuments by greek or Coptic inscriptions, containing

of Paoni the month of the sun. Why Autumn should
be attributed to Jao properly so called, is not so
clear ; but the epithet a&gog, apparently allusive to
the luxuriant bursting vegetation of the season, seems
to indicate that the whole figure refers to the climate
of Egypt, where alone such a description of autumn
would be in character ; and probably to the birth and
infancy of Horus in the months of Mesori and Thot.
In an equally appropriate manner we find that
Thot, as the patron or author of all literary or scien
tific discoveries or institutions, is placed at the head
of the civil calendar, fabled his own peculiar inven
tion ; while Ammon, the greatest and most glorious
of the popular divinities, takes precedence in the
mythological calendar ; where he also appears attend
ed by his chief favourites or companions in the pan theon ; for M. Champollion,h it seems, has identified
among the monuments of Thebes three principal di
vinities, almost invariably connected in office or in
attribute, whom he therefore calls the theban triad
or trinity, Ammon, Mouth, and Chons ; now in our
calendar we have found these very three divinities
following each other in regular succession, in the
months and signs of the zodiac ; Phamenoth, Phar
mouthi, Pachons.
All these coincidences form a mass of circumstan
tial evidence in favour of the system here proposed,
which may be the result of chance ; but if so, it must
be admitted to be a chance of a very extraordinary
and unaccountable nature.

question already noticed in a former page, as being
to a certain degree connected with our present sub
ject, namely : whether the form of calendar, and the
combination of symbols, which we have just been
examining, were originally adapted to the ancient
year of three hundred and sixty days, or to the re
formed year of three hundred and sixty-five. Upon
this point I shall not presume to express a decid
ed opinion, but content myself with offering such
observations as occur with respect to either view of
the subject, in the shape of conjecture merely ; for
to such all our endeavours to throw light on so very
obscure and doubtful a matter, concerning which we
have no satisfactory historical data, must ultimately
be reduced.
I. We have already remarked,1 that a considerable
degree of plausibility attends the opinion originally
advanced by De la Nauze, and adopted by many
other chronologers, that the reform of the calendar
coincided with the commencement of a Sothiac cycle,
and as they have supposed, of that of 1322 b. c.
Admitting its correctness ; since the Thot, or first day
of the egyptian year of three hundred and sixty-five
days, would, upon their hypothesis, have originally been
appointed to the twentieth of July, in order to find a
year whose Thot was fixed to the autumnal season, we
should be obliged to go back to the more ancient mode
of reckoning. Some authors, indeed, have been of
opinion, that the zodiac must necessarily at its original

antiquity to the chronological science of the Egyptians, will observe,
that these remarks apply, for the most part, equally well to any other
previous cycle ; although, for the sake of arrangement, and consistently
with my own view of egyptian history, I have adopted as their basis the
cycle of 1322.



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. IV. 149
institution, have been adapted to the year of 360
days, from the correspondence of the number of these
days with that of the degrees of the ecliptic ; but if
so, we can hardly doubt but that the Egyptians, if
they used this form of year in conjunction with their
zodiac, during any considerable time, were careful to
keep its commencement more or less accurately to
the seasons, by some rude method of intercalation,
perhaps by the addition of a supplementary month
from time to time ; as a substitute for which mode
the five epagomenae were afterwards permanently
added ; otherwise the rapid fluctuation of the seasons
would scarcely have admitted of the twelve months
bearing even a remote correspondence to the twelve
signs, beyond the period of a single year. That such
was really the case seems to be implied in the tradi
tion,11 that the ancient egyptian sovereigns, after the
final establishment of the calendar, were obliged to
swear at their consecration, that they would neither
intercalate month, nor day beyond the five appointed
by law. What degree of authenticity this tradition
may possess, I shall not venture to decide ; but it
certainly derives an air of probability, from the con
geniality of such a practice with the habits of a bigot
ed and superstitious people, strongly attached to ex
isting customs, and who, having already submitted to
one important alteration in their method of comput
ing time, were averse to any more such innovations.

chronologers have done ;' it muSt be obvious, that

150 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
the expression month or day could have little mean
ing, unless we suppose, that the Egyptians in remote
ages really had been in the practice of intercalating
months, as well as days ; had such a practice been
totally unknown, it is not likely that it would have
been thus specifically guarded against ; and if it be
admitted to have existed, it can be referred to no
other than the year of three hundred and sixty days.
II. On the other hand, we might suppose with Jackson,m that the Thot of the reformed calendar was
originally fixed at the autumnal equinox ; from whence
gradually retrograding, it coincided with the heliacal
rising of Sirius on the twentieth of July of the year 1322 ;n which coincidence being observed and re
corded as a remarkable epoch, became the standard
for regulating the proportion between the length of
the civil and tropical year, and consequently the cal
culation of the cycle of 1460 years. There is unques
tionably a considerable deal of speciousness attached
to this view of the matter ; for the date of egyptian
history, to which it would refer both the institution
of the new form of year, and probably the final ar
rangement of the corresponding points of the zodiac,
namely, the early part of the eighteenth dynasty, is
not only a brilliant and flourishing period of the mo
who reigned during the short intervals of freedom which occurred after
> the first subjection to the Persians ; the priests being afraid, that the in
tercalation of months in use among their oriental oppressors, might be
forced upon themselves. This hypothesis however rests on no authority,
and is in itself extremely improbable ; as there is no ground of belief
that any attempts were made, either by the persian or native princes in
later times, to innovate on this department of the national institutions.
Such partial interpretations, of allusions made by authors generally to
the customs of the ancient Egyptians, cannot be admitted unless upon
very strong evidence. m Chron. Ant. vol. ii. p. 7. conf. supr. p. 16.

narchy, but precisely that when the nation, not long
after the expulsion of the Shepherds, being restored
to its independence, may be supposed to have reor
ganized and consolidated all its civil institutions, and
from whence it appears to have made new and ra
pid strides in all the arts and sciences ; a vast pro
portion of the splendid works of architecture, sculp
ture, and painting, the remains of which still adorn
the banks of the Nile, being monuments of the mag
nificence of the distinguished family of princes, who
then sat on the throne of the Pharaohs. Upon this
principle, it were not difficult to ascertain the date of
the original coincidence of the month Thot with the
sign of Libra. For the first day of the calendar of
865 days, if fixed to the autumnal equinox, would
have retrograded between the year in which it was
so fixed and the 1322 b. c., as many days as intervene
between that on which the equinox fell on the former
year, and the 20th of July of the latter year. These
days multiplied by four, would therefore give us, on
the principle of calculation formerly noticed, the num
ber of years of interval between the two dates.0 . The
autumnal equinox in the seventeenth century b. c.
fell on the 8th of October ; between which day and
the twentieth of July are 80 days, which, multiplied
by four, produce 320 ; and these, added to 1322,
would give 1642 b.-c. as the epoch of the establish
ment of the year of 365 days. We have seen already,
that the accession of the eighteenth dynasty fluctuates

ing it to have taken place in round numbers about
the 1700, we should have the final arrangement of
the calendar not many years afterwards ; an hypothe
sis which, as already observed, is sufficiently plausible,
and consistent with the general tenor of the history
of egyptian civilization.
III. This inquiry necessarily involves to a certain
extent a much agitated chronological question, name
ly, the period of the jewish Exodus. To enter at
length upon that point, would lead into a maze of
controversy which I am here anxious to avoid. We
shall therefore be contented to bestow upon it one or
two brief observations. Josephus informs us that the
hebrew year, previous to the departure from Egypt,
commenced in autumn ; and his evidence is fully cor
roborated by the testimony of scripture. The words
of Josephus are as follows, in speaking of the flood :
" This calamity," says he, " happened in the second
month, which is called by the Macedonians Dius"
(November),4 " but by the Hebrews Marsewan ; for
so they reckoned their months in Egypt. But Moses
ordained that Nisan, which is Xanthicus" (April),
" should be the first month in respect to religious
rites, as in it he brought the Hebrews out of Egypt.
But although this was looked upon as the first of the
year in every thing relating to divine matters, yet
with respect to buying, selling, and all civil transac
of the general details of egyptian history, though upon principles differ
ent from those here laid down. Jackson (Chron. Ant. p. 193) places it
in 1722. Hales (Anal, of Chron. vol. ir. p. 418) in 1648. My reasons
for rejecting the system of M. Champollion Figeac, which carries the
eighteenth dynasty much farther back, have been given, in part at least,
in my Brief Remarks on the chronology of the egyptian dynasiies.
n Usser. de Maced. ann. sol. c. iv. Ideler, Untersuch. uber die astr.
Beob. &c. s. 246.



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. IV. 153
tions, the ancient mode of reckoning was retained."
Of the correctness of this statement of Josephus, it is
not necessary to say much, as it has been generally admitted by both chronologers and theologians ;r
being confirmed by the testimony of Moses himself
in various passages of his works. Now, consistently
with what appears to me the most correct view of the
connexion of sacred and profane chronology for this
period, (an opinion not hastily adopted, but resting
on solid reasons derived from the comparative history
of the two nations, which this is not the place to de
velop), the Exodus ought not to be dated much ear
lier than about the commencement of the sixteenth
century before our sera. If therefore the Jews then
used a year commencing in autumn, in confor
mity with the practice of the country, it must have
been the ancient form of year of 360 days ; as the
Thot of the year of 365 days, supposing it to have
been already in use, would then have fallen consider
ably above a month prior to that season. Some chro
nologers however, who place the Exodus much ear
lier, have been of opinion, that the new-year's day
of the Jews fell on the autumnal equinox, merely
in consequence of the Thot of the egyptian year,
which they had hitherto used, happening to coincide
r M. Ideler (Techn. Chron. Bd. i. s. 493) indeed appears to doubt this,
and, in as far as I know, is the first chronologer who has ventured to do
so ; but I have not been able to discover the slightest reasonable ground
for his scepticism. Matters of this kind are seldom capable of mathe
matical proof; but if the united testimony of trust-worthy authors and
reasonable tradition justify the admission of a fact, there can be no
solid reason for impugning the correctness of the statement of Josephus.

with the same season at the period of their depar
ture from Egypt, and on this basis have attempted to
calculate the date of that event. Neither the words
of Josephus, however, nor the general tenor of bibli
cal tradition, seem to be in favour of such an hypo
thesis ; nor, if we admit their authority in this matter
at all, ought we reasonably to limit their evidence
with respect to the ancient patriarchal new-year's day
to the mere observation of a temporary and accidental
coincidence. The more ancient tradition of the Jews,
indeed, referred the origin of this primitive calendar
to the creation itself,8 which they supposed to have
taken place in autumn^ and that the pristine egyptian
mythology corresponded here also to a certain extent,
I see little reason to doubt, as it is an admitted fact,
that the egyptian cosmogonists followed the mosaic
principle of creation, namely, that of a chaos or flood
of waters, which gradually subsiding, caused the dry
land to appear. It is also certain that they connected
this tradition, and very naturally, with the subsiding
of the flood of their own river, which both displayed
to view, and renovated with fresh vegetative power,
the land of Egypt. There are, it is true, various pas
sages of popular authors, as of Porphyry, Macrobius,
Julius Firmicus, and others, which refer the creation
of the world, according to the Egyptians, to about
midsummer. But there is reason to believe that these
statements are merely grounded on the knowledge
that the revolution or uToxuruirraaig of the sothiac
cycle, (and with it the proper commencement of the
egyptian year in its more recent form,) was connect
ed with that season. Of this the very vagueness

OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. IV. 155
and discrepancy of the statements themselves afford
strong proof. With Porphyry, both the creation and
the commencement of the egyptian year took place in
Cancer, because the Dog-star was situated in or near
that constellation / which expression can only be un
derstood as alluding to the circumstance, that this star,
during the whole period of its connexion with the egyp
tian year, rose heliacally in the latitude of Egypt, when
the sun was in the sign Cancer. Of the value of the
testimony of Porphyry in this instance, we may judge
by his assertion, contained in the same passage, that
the roman year dated from the sign Aquarius, where
as it commenced nearly with Capricorn. Macrobius"
places the creation, according to the Egyptians, in the
sign Leo, apparently on a precisely similar principle,
because the reappearance of Sothis in his age and cli
mate coincided nearly with the entrance of the sun
into the Lion. As for Julius Firmicus," whose works
appear to contain considerable traces of the pure egypt
ian astrology, in one place he seems to agree with
Macrobius, where he states, that the world was created
in the forty-fifth day after the solstice, that is, in the
middle of the sign Leo ; but in another place" he in
forms us, that the earth was finally arranged and or
dered in the latter part of the sign Libra, which is
more favourable to our hypothesis. The apparent

of the world or universe, and the formation of our
habitable terrestrial globe ; or by supposing, what is
perhaps more probable, that the one tradition refers
to the more recent, the other to the ancient calendar."
Although the old jewish cosmogonists placed the
creation of the world in autumn, yet there were not
wanting some among the rabbisy who assigned it to
spring. And it is curious enough, that the argument
advanced by the authors of the new system tends to
prove, that the other opinion was connected with
egyptian tradition ; because, say the new school,
and plausibly enough, it is not probable that the crea
tion should coincide with the decline or fall of the
year, but rather with the opening season.2 Now, this
very motive would lead the egyptians to place both
the creation and their new-year's day at the autumnal
equinox, which was in their climate the opening sea
son or natural spring, as March and April were in
Palestine.
IV. The evidence of the monuments, which are,
no doubt, the most valuable guides in egyptian re
search, might perhaps assist our inquiries into the pe
riod of the first establishment of the year of three
hundred and sixty-five days. We have seen above,
that, in the very ancient papyri, whence M. Champol
lion has derived his hieroglyphic calendar, the sign of
month is merely an inverted half-moon, as described
by Horapollo. But in the Rosetta inscription, and
* M. Champollion asserts, (Panth. pl. 2,) that, according to the egypt
ian cosmogony, the world was created by Ammon at the vernal equinox.
He has not, however, produced any authority for that statement, nor am
1 aware that any exists.

other monuments," which have served as authorities
for the calendar of the Cairo collection, we find a star,
in addition to the original symbol, forming portion of
the group. Whether this peculiarity be confined to
inscriptions of a later date than 1322, or to those of
any particular period whatever, we have no means of
judging ; but the additional mark itself can hardly re
fer to any thing else but the connexion of the calendar
with some star, and that star cannot well be any other
than Sirius. This emblem may have been attached to
the seasons at the reform of the calendar, to denote
that the length of the year was in future to be regu
lated by the supposed motions of the stars, more es
pecially of Sirius ; not of the moon, as in former
times. Might not this be alluded to by an obscure remark of Horapollo,b contained in a passage, part of
which has already been quoted, where that author ap
pears to state, that the Egyptians denoted a year, among
other symbols, by the star Isis, or Sothis : 'JLviuvrdv

all that is to take place during the year. Hence it is
not without reason that the year is called Isisl"
But at whatever period, or under whatever cir
cumstances, this primeval coincidence of the egyptian
new year's day with the sign Libra may have taken
place, the question may perhaps occur, how came
the zodiacal signs which were originally attached to
the twelve months to remain fixed, when the posi
tions of the months with respect to the seasons under
went an alteration ? and why, if it was originally
meant that a connexion should subsist between the
civil and the astrological calender, was that intention
so completely lost sight of? These and other ques
tions of a similar nature, our imperfect acquaintance
with the early history of egyptian science puts it out
of our power to answer ; it is sufficient to be able
to judge, on plausible grounds, that such was the
case. The twelve months even with the epagomense
were soon found to be imperfect, but the division of
the heavens into twelve portions of thirty degrees
each, was found to be very perfect, and highly con
ducive to the facility of computing time, and of ob
serving the heavenly bodies. The imperfection of
the one system was no reason for abandoning the
other ; on the contrary, the effects produced by the
separation of the two on the national superstition
were in close harmony, as we have shown above,
with the proverbial taste of the egyptian priesthood
for mystery and enigma. If we admit the opinion
of De la Nauze respecting the first establishment of
the year of 365 days, we should be equally at a loss
to know the precise motive which induced them to
date its commencement, not as before from the
equinox, but from the rising of the dog-star ; or why,



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. IV. 159
in fixing the Thot to the period of the rapid rise of the
Nile, they should have retained, as its hieroglyphic,
a symbol denoting the subsiding of the waters, which
necessarily produced a corresponding irregularity
throughout the remainder of the calendar ; but that it
must have been so is obvious. The best method of
throwing light on any obscure matter of this kind is by
analogy ; and we should have one of a very curious
nature in the history of the roman year, the first day
of which was fixed, in early times, on or about the
vernal equinox, March being the first month, and
February the last ; whence the seventh, eighth, ninth,
and tenth, were called September, October, Novem
ber, December ; their names in the latin tongue
literally denoting their places. Subsequent altera
tions, the details of which are almost as doubtful as
of those which took place in the egyptian calendar,
caused these months to become the ninth, tenth,
eleventh, and twelfth ; yet they still retained their
former names, which does not seem to have shocked
the delicate ear of the latin grammarian, though
quite as great a paradox, in point of idiom, as would
have been the retaining the hieroglyphic of vege
tation for the month Thot, after it was become the
season of the full flood of Nile. The incongruity
between the emblems of the months and their
new positions in the egyptian year was, it may be
farther observed, by no means so striking in the
eyes of the vulgar, as that between the names of
the roman months and their new position in the
roman calendar ; for the pure hieroglyphic, which
alone preserved the original type or symbol, was
appropriated to the sacred records and the use of the
priests ; and the existence of this very anomaly, com

bined with the knowledge of its real cause, would
add to their stock of mysteries. On the other hand,
in the enchorial character, which was alone in popular
use, the original form had totally disappeared, or degenerated into a mere sign,c denoting with the
vulgar nothing more than the simple names, Thot,
Paophi, &c. The new calendar being too, after all,
defective, and the months in a short time discovered
to be still unsettled, the impropriety of the emblems,
according to the new positions, would soon have
become of little importance. When we find such
strange anomalies, during the most civilized period
of the egyptian empire, sanctioned both by custom
and law, we can feel the less surprised at any others
of a similar nature which may present themselves,
in the course of our investigations into the chrono
logy of its remote and obscure ages.
We shall now willingly take leave of these dark
and intricate matters, all attempts to elucidate which
can only end in conjecture of a sufficiently vague ,
and unsatisfactory nature, and extend our observa
tions to the history of the first introduction and use
of the zodiac among the Greeks.

REMARKS ON THE FIRST INTRODUCTION AND USE OP
THE ZODIAC AMONG THE GREEKS.
The inquiry to which the present section is devoted,
though belonging to a department of critical research,
of a somewhat different nature from that in which
we have hitherto been engaged, is yet closely con
nected with our previous subject in more ways than
one. First, from the interest we may naturally take,
in following up our endeavours to investigate the re
mote origin of this celebrated institution, by tracing
its progress across the mediterranean, and adoption
by the most anciently civilized people of the western
-world ; from whom its use has been propagated
among almost all the nations of modern times, who
have paid any attention to astronomical science. Se
condly, because several authors of eminence having
been of opinion, that the zodiac is of hellenic rather
than egyptian origin ; others, that its constellations
in their present form, as delineated on our globes,
were familiar at least to the remotest ages of fabulous
greek antiquity ; and having made these opinions,
respectively, the basis of their endeavours to illustrate

its history, and of conclusions widely discrepant from
those to which we have been led by the foregoing
researches,—it becomes of importance to investigate,
on this head, as much of the truth as the nature of
existing testimonies will permit.
A careful examination of the comparative history
and antiquities of the two countries, has led me to
the conviction, that the accounts of the direct impor
tation of egyptian science into Greece during its he
roic ages, by colonies transplanted from the banks of
the Nile to the coasts of the JEgean, are destitute of
any reasonable probability. Still less credible are the
legends of the voyages up the Nile, undertaken by the
early sages of barbarous Hellas, the purely mythical
Orpheus, Musaeus, Triptolemus, or the semi-historical
Homer," Hesiod, Lycurgus, and their initiation into
the mysteries of the priests of Heliopolis or of Thebes.
The first real connexion between the two countries
ought to be dated from the reign of Psammetichus,
who overcame or violated the ancient prejudices of
his subjects, and admitted the Greeks freely to the in
terior of the country, as visitors, as settlers, or as
mercenaries. From this period we can first trace histo
rically the direct and positive influence of the manners
and mythology of Egypt, on those of their european
neighbours. The force of early association will per
haps raise up difficulties against the admission of this
as a general rule, nor is this the place to support it by
any lengthened argument ; but in as far as our pre
sent question is immediately concerned, it will be
found I trust nearly capable of demonstration.
Although the early poets of Greece, during many
1 See Appendix, No. XXI.

ages the only authors she possessed, make frequent
allusion to the heavenly bodies and their motions,
both as connected with their mythology, and as serv
ing as guides to the rustic in his labours, or beacons
to the navigator in his course $ and though they seem
to have been in the habit, like all other barbarous
nations, of combining certain remarkable stars into
constellations, with names significant of their forms,
positions, or supposed influences ; it will be remarked,
that among these names, those of the signs of the
zodiac never occur. Yet it were natural to infer, had
they been known, as has been so often gratuitously
supposed, long before the trojan war, that they might
have been considered by Homer, Hesiod, and other
old poets, (as they ever have been since they became
familiar,) among the most important, and most worthy
of notice, whether in an astronomical or poetical
point of view. Homer says that Vulcan, among
other decorations of the shield of Achilles, distributed
around its circumference all the images which adorn
the heaven :
'Ev (ilv yuiav irzvl,', h 5' ovoavov h 11 ^uXaatrav,
'Ej» Ss ra nioiot, tkvtu, rd, r oiteavdf ianpavwrxi'
After this, although we could hardly expect him to
give us a literal catalogue of all the constellations,
yet one might reasonably suppose that in mentioning
the most remarkable, he would not overlook the
twelve celebrated emblems of the zodiac, or at least
the noblest and most poetical among their number,
had he known them ; but he continues :

Dog-star, the second of Bootes ; and frequently enters
into minute definitions of the proper divisions of the
seasons, according to the rustic calendar, with reference
to the rising, setting, and culminating of certain favour
ite stars ; but without betraying the slightest know ledge of such a thing as a zodiac or its signs ;m and
the same may be said of the early writers of Greece,
almost without exception ; up even to the very period
when we find the institution in familiar use, among
the practical astronomers who flourished towards the
commencement of the peloponnesian war.

there is hardly a single one of which the name is not
cither according to a palpably hellenic etymology,
significant of its form or supposed influences, or
directly referable to pure greek or grecophenician
fable. Thus, where Homer calls the bear, "Agxrov,
%v kui "Af/ju%ui> . . . the name afAu%oc, or wain, which
is common to many ancient nations, is suggested at once by the form of the asterism ;n for it is evident,
as Hipparchus" also assures us, that the old rustic
astrologers comprehended, in this constellation, not
the whole space occupied by the monstrous figure to
which the same name is now applied, according to
the more recent division of the sphere, but the seven
bright stars alone which compose its rump or tail.
The appellation of bear, however, can hardly be
derived from any thing in the arrangement of the
stars themselves, but seems to imply some allusion to

animal with the extreme cold towards the pole,p
which the Greeks, or the phenician navigators, from
whom they borrowed their notions of geography,

voyages. This asterism, we are positively assured
by the ancients, whose testimony is confirmed by that
of the monuments, bore a totally different appellation
among the Egyptians, being dedicated to their Ty

likened to a flight of pigeons.8 The oriental astro

in the vulgar idiom of various nations.' The Hyads

enough with reference to the legend of Virgil, that the roman tradition

the city. (Plin. L. XVIII. c 26.) w A most natural figure, also familiar to the Arabs. Abderrahman
Suphi (ap. Hyde ad. TJlugh. Beigh. p. 51) says, that Canis major is called
Kelb-algebbar, or the dog of the giant, because it continually follows
Orion, which constellation was named ihe giant among them. And

lows the constellation of Orion, hence called the Dog." x Possibly from TUT, principatum gerere ; the probability of which
etymology receives incidental force from passages of various authors,
tending to show how naturally this idea presented itself to the pagan
astrologers. Thus Horapollo, among the reasons for this star being
consecrated to Isis, remarks, " that it appears to reign over all the other stars" '«? Kai ooKii tuv XnnrStv an,ri^ar (3airiXtviiv, (Hierog. L. I. c. 3.)

This star was called by the Egyptians Isis, or the star
of Isis. Hence the name Sothis in the feminine
gender, while those of the dog star, zva>v, aargoxvuv,
Hu'giog, are masculine. In the egyptian mythology,
Sothis was adored as the most beneficent of the
heavenly bodies, while with the greek poets its in
fluences are proverbially blasting and noxious.
Now in all these remnants of the primitive hellenic
astrology, we cannot discover the least trace of egyp
tian fable, or egyptian figurative imagery, which in
the zodiac and its signs it is equally impossible to
overlook ; and this, besides the silence of antiquity,
is sufficient proof that the knowledge of these last
was comparatively recent in Greece.
The only account of the precise period of the
first use of the zodiac in that country, which seems
worthy of any attention, is preserved by Pliny,8 who
assigns the division of its constellations to Cleostratus of Tenedos, about 536 b. c. ;b this may, I presume,
be understood of his having first distributed the stars
in the neighbourhood of the ecliptic, among the twelve
imaginary creatures whose names were contained
in the original symbols, when first imported from
Egypt. The first attempt at a more accurate obser
vation of the sun's course, after the method of the
Suidas has the variety 2s/'g. The Arabs, besides the appellation Dog-,

primitive oriental name, whence the Greeks have borrowed theirs ; and
tyo signify hairy or bristly (c£j^&), which is not unreasonable, as the
remarkable sparkling or twinkling of Sirius really gives it such an ap
pearance. (Ideler. op. cit. p. 240.)

egyptian zodiac, may perhaps be hinted at in the
tradition, that Pythagoras0 according to some, Ana
ximander according to others,*1 first observed the
obliquity of the ecliptic ; which cannot allude to any
thing else but a more accurate measurement of that
circle, and of the distance of the tropic from the
equator '; for the mere variation of the sun's course
from the equinoctial must have been self-evident
even to the simplest contemplator. This observation
was, according to Pliny, what suggested to Cleos
tratus the construction of his zodiac, rerum fores
aperuit." All these efforts towards the advancement
of science were made not long after Thales, and other
enterprising sages, had brought the knowledge of
several scientific institutions of the Egyptians, and
other ancient and highly civilized nations, into Asia
minor. The use of the new method of regulating
the calendar seems, however, not to have been for a
considerable time afterwards either popular or familiar,
but to have been confined almost entirely to astro
nomers and mathematicians ; for not one of the extant
classical authors, who are ascertained to have flou
rished previous to the days of Meton, makes the
slightest allusion to the zodiac or its signs. Hero
dotus especially, if we may judge from his silence,
appears to have been ignorant of them. The same
may be said of the Avritings of Plato, and the older
attic poets. The first extant work, if we admit its
title to be authentic, where we find any distinct
account of the signs of the zodiac, is the sphere attri
buted to Empedocles, published by Fabricius in his

Dibliotheca grseca/ Whether it really be the pro
duction of that celebrated philosopher is more than
doubtful ; but from its style and language, there can
be no objection to assigning its author nearly an equal
antiquity with Aratus, who wrote his poem called
the Phenomena about the year 270 b. c, the earliest
positively authenticated work of a popular nature
where the zodiac is mentioned. That its use, how
ever, was familiar to practical astronomers long before
this period is evident from the fragments of Eudoxus,
and the testimony of later mathematicians, who quote
his authority, and that of other philosophers of a still
older date.
The earliest mathematicians on record, who fixed
the cardinal points of the sun's course, from observa
/ tion, in degrees of the ecliptic, according to the twelve
signs or constellations, are Euctemon and Meton.
Euctemon8 placed the winter solstice and the autum
nal equinox in the first degrees of Capricorn and Li bra. Meton,h however, about the same time, is said
to have fixed the same points in the eighth degrees.

tus and Hipparchus, re-established them in the first,*
where they have with little exception ever since re
mained ; and from thence is supposed to date the
more accurate distinction between signs and constel
lations ; the first thirty degrees of longitude, counted
on the ecliptic from the vernal equinox for the time
being, having been ever since considered as Aries,
and so of the other cardinal points ; although the pre
cession of equinoxes has carried them far from their
original positions, with respect to the constellations
whose names they bear. By constellation I would
be understood to mean the well known groups of
stars, comprehended within the outline of certain ima
ginary forms of living or inanimate objects, as still de
lineated on our globes ; by signs, the dodecatemoria,
or equal portions of thirty degrees of the ecliptic, as
subdivided for the purpose of astronomical calcula
tion. Where it is doubtful which of these methods
was followed by different astronomers in recording
their observations, I have used both designations.
To whom we may be originally indebted for the
precise outline of the imaginary figures of the con
stellations of the greek zodiac, according to the ar
rangement which has been generally adopted in both
ancient and modern times, whether to Cleostratus
himself, or to succeeding astrologers, is unknown.
But the above mentioned strange variety in the defi
nitions of the three first mathematicians, who are re
corded to have noted their observations' according to
the twelve divisions of that circle, can only be reason
ably accounted for, by supposing that they distribut
ed those divisions, whether as constellations or signs,,
k Gemin. Elem. c. 1G.



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. V. 173
differently ; or, in other words, that the constellation
or sign of the Ram with Eudoxus, comprehended a
different portion of the heaven about the ecliptic,
from that assigned it by Euctemon and those who
followed his method. And that such was really the
case we are assured by Hipparchus, who, in his trea
tise on the Phenomena, gives convincing examples of.
the existence and effect of this variety, and of the
confusion which it produced, in all attempts to recon
cile the observations of different greek astronomers,
as compared with each other. Some of these exam
ples we shall have occasion to adduce in a subsequent
page. This singular vagueness and incongruity, how
ever, of the methods of distributing the signs or con
stellations, followed by the earliest greek sages who
are reported to have used the zodiac, affords another
strong proof in addition to those already advanced,
how very recent and imperfect the knowledge of the
institution really was in Greece in their days ; and
shews at the same time, that with the greater number
of the early astronomers of that country, the divisions
of the ecliptic, as already remarked, must be consi
dered as signs rather than as constellations ; each
having adopted that mode of arrangement which best
suited his system, or appeared to him, with reference
to the remainder of the sphere, to afford the greatest
facilities of celestial observation.
Some authors have however attempted to account
for these varieties in a different manner. Setting out
with the presupposition, that the constellations of the
zodiac, as delineated in the greek sphere, were really
of hellenic invention, or at least had been familiar to
the Greeks from time immemorial, they have assumed,
that those among the above mentioned astronomers,



17* ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
who placed their equinoctial or solstitial points to the
eastward of the first degrees of the constellations
Aries, Libra, Cancer, Capricorn, followed certain an
cient calendars, still in use among the rustics of
Greece, formed at a period when the colures really
did occupy the eighth or fifteenth degrees of the con
stellations in their present form, from which, owing
to the precession of equinoxes, they had gradually re
ceded. Thus no less a man than the great Sir I.
Newton,1 having assumed that the zodiac was invent
ed by the fabulous centaur ChirOn for the use of the
Argonauts, and that the supposed old calendar, fol
lowed by Eudoxus, which placed the Colures in the
middle of the constellations, was the same originally
constructed by that allegorical personage, and finding
that Meton fixed the same colures in the eighth de
grees ; he inferred, that they had receded seven de
grees in the intermediate period ; whence, by calcu
lating the precession of equinoxes at a degree in se
venty-two years, and adopting such an arrangement
of other principal constellations of the sphere, as was
most favourable to his own views, he concluded that
Chiron must have flourished 504 years before Meton,
or 935 b. c. ; at which epoch therefore he places the
expedition of the Argonauts,TM and on this basis erects
his system of chronology.
How fallacious such a method must be, is evident
from the circumstance already mentioned, that Euc
temon, who observed at the same time as Meton, and
Calippus, who flourished not long after, placed their
cardinal points in the first, and not in the eighth de
grees ; so that a chronologer, who found it suited his
5 Chronol. p. 2.0. 82. sqq. M Clrronol. p. !)3.



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. V. 17,5
system, might equally, upon this principle, assume,
that, in the days of Euctemon, the colures had reced
ed fifteen degrees since the time of Chiron, and as
sign, accordingly, the argonautic expedition to a much
more remote period of antiquity.
Such, in fact, has been the method of Freret," who,
in combating with considerable success the antiquarian
mistakes of our great countryman, has himself fallen
into others of a similar but still more flagrant nature.
Assuming, like Sir Isaac, that the zodiacal constella
tions had been in use in Greece time out of mind, he
has adopted the very hypothesis above alluded to, viz.
that, in the days of Euctemon, the cardinal points,
which had been originally fixed at a much more ad
vanced point of the constellations, had retrograded to
their commencement ; that Meton, in placing them
in the eighth degrees, followed an old rustic ca
lendar, constructed in the tenth century b. c. ; that
Eudoxus, in like manner, in fixing them at the six
teenth," conformed to a still more ancient calendar,
constructed in the fifteenth century b. c. ;p that is to
say, that Meton and Eudoxus, though perfectly aware
that the cardinal points really were nearly in the first
degrees of their respective constellations, out of defe
rence to the rustics of Cnidos or of Attica, among
whom these calendars were still in use, placed them,
in their respective works, the one about eight, the
other fifteen degrees out of their true positions. Of
this theory, which its author has developed at great
detail, in his celebrated controversial work, entitled,

176 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
Defense de la Chronologie, and which has been very
generally adopted by succeeding writers on these sub
jects, I shall endeavour shortly to point out the fal
lacy.
In the first place, it must be observed, that the
whole of the above system, plausible as it has appear
ed to many, is contrary to the express testimony of
the ancients, more especially of Hipparchus and Ca
lumella, to whose works the learned academician and
his followers have principally appealed in support of
their hypothesis, but who, instead of justifying, con
fute it, as shall be shown, in the most positive terms.
But, besides this, it were in itself most extraordinary,
and indeed almost incredible, that Meton and Eu
doxus, who pretended to be correct practical astrono
mers, after the fashion of the time, and who have al
ways been considered, if not as the fathers of the
science, at least as its first great reformers and im
provers among the Greeks, should intentionally have
composed complete theories of the heavens upon the
basis of a wilful error of not less than fifteen degrees
of longitude in the position of the cardinal points of
the sun's course, and that merely to gratify the rustic
prejudices of the time. " On ne s'embarrassait pas beaucoup," says Freret,q " de placer les points car
dinaux hors de leur veritable lieu ; on songeait seul
ment a se faire entendre des gens de la campagne,
pour lesquels on ecrivait, et dont il fallait respecter
les prejuges." That the first philosophers of Greece
wrote merely for the peasantry, whose prejudices it
was necessary to respect, is surely a most unwarrant
able supposition. If men of science were to conform
i Op. cit. p. 10.



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. V. 177
thus servilely to all the vulgar errors of the day, their
labours would comparatively be of little value. Their
object ought to be, and we may be sure that of Meton
and Eudoxus was, by their discoveries to correct and
root out, not to confirm, the ignorance and bigotry
of the lower orders of their countrymen. We shall
first turn our attention to the method of Eudoxus,
which, as described by Hipparchus, has formed the
principal groundwork of the speculations of Freret,
and those who have adopted his views ; and in the
course of our inquiries into it, we shall be led to a
few observations upon that of Meton.
Hipparchus, in his commentary on the Phenomena
of Aratus,1 sets out by observing, that the poet, in his
description of the heavenly bodies, had for the most
part imitated, or even closely copied, the sphere of
Eudoxus, frequently doing little more than transcribe
his words in verse. When, however, he comes to
institute a close comparison between the two authors,
he thus expresses himself:8 " First of all, it must be
considered, that Aratus so divided his zodiac, that the
tropical and equinoctial points should form the com
mencement of the signs ; but Eudoxus so, that the
same points should be the middle of Cancer, Capri
corn, Aries, and Libra." Having then quoted cer
tain statements of Aratus in proof of his first asser
tion, he adds, " and in this way almost all the old
astronomers divided their zodiac ;" which passage,
as we have before had occasion to remark, is of great
importance, as showing the superior antiquity of this
method, originally borrowed, it may be presumed,
from the Egyptians or Chaldees ; and that the prac
1 Lib, i. c. 2, p. 98. s Lib. ii. c. 3, p. 1 19.
N



178 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
tice of assigning the cardinal points to various other
parts of the signs or constellations, is comparatively
a recent innovation. Hipparchus then proceeds to
prove the truth of the second part of his statement,
in the words of Eudoxus himself. " He himself,"
says he,' " bears witness, that he placed the solstitial
points in the middle of the signs, in the following
words : ' The second circle is that in which the sum
mer conversions are effected ; in it is the middle of
Cancer. The third circle is that in which the equi
noxes are effected ; it passes through the centre of
Aries and of Libra. The fourth, in which is the win
ter tropic, is in the middle of Capricorn.' " Had Eu
doxus meant to say that all this took place in Chiron's
time, or about 900 years before his own ; or, that
these were not the true cardinal points, but merely
what the rustics of Cnidos considered as such, it were
surprising that he should have expressed himself in
such a manner ; but still more so, that neither Hip
parchus, one of the acutest critics that ever exist
ed, nor any succeeding commentator, should have
had a suspicion of his true meaning. But, in truth,
according to the actual arrangement of the zodiacal
constellations, as supposed to have existed in the days
of Chiron, (namely, that still followed on our globes,)
it is impossible that the colures could have fallen in
the middle of the four constellations, Aries, Libra,
Cancer, and Capricorn, since these occupy unequal
and very irregular portions of the ecliptic ; so that
such a correspondence never could have existed."
This were in itself sufficient proof that Eudoxus disr
t Lib. ii. c. 3, p. 120.
u Vid. Delarabre, Hist. de l'astron. anc. torn. i. p. xli.



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. V. 179
tributed his zodiac, and placed his cardinal points, af
ter a method of his own, without reference to the
sphere of Chiron or any other such visionary system.
But, besides all this, Hipparchus has, fortunately,
in numerous illustrations of the positions of the hea
venly bodies, as referred to their longitude, according
to the above various methods of dividing the zodiac,
left us convincing and unequivocal proof, that although
Eudoxus placed the same cardinal points in the middle
of the signs which Aratus and he himself fixed at their
commencement, yet both, making allowances for trif
ling errors or discrepancies consequent on their im
perfect mode of observation, assigned, or meant to as
sign them precisely the same position in the ecliptic.
I shall quote nearly his own words, confining myself
to examples drawn from great and important constel
lations, concerning whose real form and position there
can be no difference of opinion ; for as to many of the
other more obscure or less well-defined asterisms, there
can be little doubt but that in the sphere of Eudoxus
they differed as much in their precise extent and figure
from those which Hipparchus designated by the same
names, as did the signs of the zodiac themselves. I
have also selected such examples as are least charge
able with that confusion and inconsistency from which
many portions of the work of Hipparchus, in its pre
sent state, great as is its general merit, are not ex
empt.
" The last and most easterly star in the tail of the
great Bear, on a circle parallel to the equator, would
be situated in the fourth degree of Libra, the solsti
tial and equinoctial points being fixed at the com
mencement of the signs ; but if, with Eudoxus, we
place those points in the middle of the signs, the same



180 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
star will be situated in the nineteenth of Libra."v If
the fourth degree of the Libra of Aratus or Hippar
chus corresponds with the nineteenth degree of the
Libra of Eudoxus, it follows, that the first degree of
the same sign with Hipparchus must correspond with
the sixteenth according to Eudoxus ; consequently
their equinoctial colures were in the same point of the
ecliptic.
Again, according to the method of Aratus," " the
most southerly of the four stars which form the quad
rangle of the great Bear, occupied about the twenty
fifth degree of Leo ;" but, according to the other sys
tem, "the same star coincided with the tenth of Virgo."
The result answers precisely to that obtained from the
foregoing example. The first degree of the Virgo of
Aratus would be equivalent to the sixteenth with Eu
doxus; the first of Leo to its sixteenth; and the com
mencement of each sign to the centre of the same,
according to the arrangement of each respectively. Again :x " the last and brightest star of the lesser
Bear is situated in the eighteenth degree of Pisces,
but as Eudoxus divides his zodiac in the third of
Aries." Consequently the sixteenth of Pisces with
Aratus corresponded to the first of Aries with Eu
doxus ; the first of Aries with Aratus to the sixteenth
with Eudoxus ; so that, as in the previous instances,
their cardinal points, though nominally different, oc
cupied the same position in the true ecliptic/
This is farther illustrated by the discrepancy be
tween their trvvuvurokui, and (rvyxurativtrug, or the de
scription of the stars or constellations, which rose or

set together with particular portions of the zodiac,
according to the two systems ; which also shews, not
less pointedly, that the corresponding signs were fixed
by Eudoxus, many degrees of longitude west of those
of Aratus.
" Aratus," says his commentator,* " having sup
posed the commencement of Cancer to be on the eastern horizon, observes, that the (lowera) half of
the Crown had set ; the southern Fish as far as the
back fin ; Ingeniculus up to the belly ; Ophiuchus as
far as the shoulders, &c. But Eudoxus asserts, that
the whole of Ingeniculus is still visible when Cancer
begins to rise ; the (lower) half of the Crown ; the
heads of Arctophylax and Ophiuchus, &c." It would
appear, by a reference to our globes, that several of
the constellations mentioned in this passage were dif
ferently arranged in the sphere of Eudoxus from what
they are now ; but it is equally clear, as well from the
description of those which correspond, as from the
remarks of Hipparchus, that as they were visible to a
much greater extent above the western horizon on
the rising of Cancer, according to Eudoxus, than ac
cording to Aratus, the Cancer of the one must have
commenced much farther west in the ecliptic than
that of the other. And accordingly Hipparchus con tinues :b " Concerning the Crown Aratus is right, as
in the latitude of Greece it begins to set when the
twenty-third degree of Gemini rises, and goes down
altogether when the fourth of Cancer rises. But the
method of Eudoxus is palpably different, since the
beginning of Cancer is placed by him in the middle
* L. ii. c. 5. p. 180. a So it must be rendered, consistently with the general sense of the
passage. b P. 121.



182 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
of Gemini ; so that let it be observed once for all,
that as they portioned their signs differently, it is
impossible that the relative phenomena can corres
pond in the descriptions of each." This is sufficient
ly explicit. If therefore Eudoxus placed the com
mencement of his Cancer in the middle of the Ge
mini of Aratus, the sixteenth of Cancer with the one,
would correspond to the first of Cancer with the
other, their solstitial points being as before precisely
the same in the true ecliptic.
I have dwelt on these convincing examples at the
greater length, because Freret himself0 has noticed
several of them, admitting that their evidence is con
clusive. But by some most unaccountable confusion
of ideas, he has advanced them as proof of the cor
rectness of his own theory ; whereas it must be clear
to every person who comprehends them, and could
scarcely have escaped his own acute judgment, had it
not been blinded by system, that their direct tendency
is on the contrary to subvert and destroy it altoge
ther. It is no less surprising that he should, through
out his argument, have formally referred the reader
to Petavius, for farther proof and illustration of his views ;d calling him justly a great man, and appear
ing to pay the greatest deference to his opinion. If,
however, the authority of Petavius were to be final,
the question would indeed be decided, but in a very
different manner from what he supposed ; for on re
ferring to the works of that profound calculator, I
find that he not only held precisely the same opinion
as that here supported, but has devoted several chap
ters to the careful examination and confutation of the
f Dei', de la Chron. p. 449. d Op. cit. pp. 7. 450.



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. V. 183
very system of which the french academician profess
ed himself an advocate. To him, therefore, I shall
in my turn refer the reader.6
I am well aware that this theory, propounded I be
lieve first by Scaliger, justified to a certain extent by
Sir I. Newton, and more fully developed by Freret,
has obtained great popularity among modern critics,
and been adopted by many distinguished authors be
sides those above mentioned/ But authorities can
not prevail against facts ; and those which have been
here brought forward are too unequivocal to be mis
understood. Whiston, who like Freret combated
the system of Sir I. Newton, admitting, with that
great man, that Chiron was the inventor of the zo
diac, but differing from him merely with respect to
the period of invention, composed a dissertation, in
serted by Freret in his work,8 to prove that the car
dinal points, as constituted by Eudoxus, relate to near
ly the same remote period of antiquity assumed by
the french antiquary. I shall not attempt to follow
him through his argument, which both in as far as re
gards his attempt to confute Newton, as his endeavour
to establish his own position, appears fallacious and
inconclusive. I shall merely mention the principal
drift of it. He, like Sir Isaac, lays down as a basis,
the description given by Eudoxus, as quoted by Hip
parchus, of the line of constellations through which
'• Var. Diss. ii. c. 5. p. 44. Haec non obscure testantur, requinoctia et

the colures passed from north to south ; and then en
deavours to show, that, consistently with a certain ar
rangement of these constellations, partly with refer
ence to their form as now delineated on our globes,
partly to that in which he supposes they may have
appeared on those of the aboriginal Greeks, the same
colures would have passed toward fifteen degrees to the
eastward of their true positions for the days of Eu
doxus himself. Whatever plausibility his argument
may possess, seems to be derived chiefly from the dis
crepancy in the accounts given of the constellations
by the various authors who have transmitted any de
tails concerning their ancient form, upon which va
rieties he naturally enough puts a private interpreta
tion most favourable to his own views ; the changes
which he has found it necessary to make in several of
them, in order to accommodate them to his own sys
tem, being quite as inadmissible as those with which
he reproaches Sir Isaac. The description given by
Eudoxus of the constellations through which the co
lures passed, is indeed, as must be evident to any one
who impartially examines it, totally irreconcilable up
on any system, or by a reference to any age of the
world, with their actual arrangement on the tables of
Bayer, or upon our globes. Frereth has also with a similar view, instituted a
comparison between the line of Colures according to
their description by Eudoxus, and their true position
in the days of that philosopher ; more especially with
reference to the strictures of Hipparchus on the
errors that description contains. The result, however,
he himself, as well from the difficulty of ascertaining
h Op. sup. cit. p. 451, sq(j.



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. V. 185
the precise form of the ancient asterisms, as from
other causes, appears to have found so little satisfac
tory, that he admits the principal weight ought to
belong to the striking illustrations above adduced, from
the comparative positions of those heavenly bodies,
concerning the form of which there can be no dis
pute ; and in so doing, he has, as already observed,
unintentionally brought forward the most conclusive
arguments against his own system. He has, farther,
collated the respective delineations of the tropical
and equinoctial circles, by Eudoxus, Aratus,1 and
Manetho, in order to show, that they bore reference
to the positions for the same remote period, but here,
as before, in spite of a very arbitrary mode of deduc
tion, the just inference appears to be far from favour
able to his own views.
There can be no stronger proof of the little reli
ance to be placed on any evidence, derived from par
tial illustration of the supposed form and positions of
fanciful groups of stars, concerning which, as denned
in the spheres of the more ancient astronomers, we
have so few precise data, than the circumstance, that such men as Petavius, Newton supported by Halley,k
and Whiston, have each arrived by that method at
1 That any appeal should here be made to Aratus is the more surpris
ing, since Hipparchus (L. ii. c. 3. p. 119.) expressly states that although
that poet agreed with Eudoxus in his real positions, yet he placed his
cardinal points in the commencement of the signs ; and this he also proves
very clearly by the following passage of the Phenomena, descriptive of
the arc of the horizon within which the zodiac rises and sets. (v. 537,

186 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
conclusions favourable to their own views, though
totally irreconcilable with each other. There is
however this difference in the value to be attached to
the speculations of these great calculators, that while
the inquiries of english astronomers were confined to
one point, and that for the purpose of establishing
particular systems, the learned Jesuit extended his
views over the whole circuit of the astronomical
chronology of the ancients ; and without any favour
ite theory to support, has elucidated these obscure mat
ters, with such a vast deal of profound learning and
solid argument, as must carry conviction to every un
prejudiced mind.
With regard to the strictures of Hipparchus him
self on the position of Eudoxus, on which Freret lays
considerable stress, as confirming his views, it may be
remarked, that although the distinguished commenta
tor of Aratus criticises and condemns with much
bitterness, and frequently with undue severity, the
views of his predecessor, yet he never betrays the
slightest suspicion, that Eudoxus had either wilfully
or unintentionally misplaced his real cardinal points
to any considerable extent ; but finds fault, partly
with actual errors in his positions, chiefly, however,
with what he considers a confused or unusual arrange
ment of certain constellations. To this his principal
censures are directed; and it were inconceivable, had
the whole theory of Eudoxus been grounded on a
wilful error of fifteen degrees in the positions of the
Colures, that so acute a genius as Hipparchus, when
carefully reading and commenting his work, should
never have had a surmise of his real intention ; but
should merely have supposed, that in the division of



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. V. 187
the ecliptic, he had made the commencement of his
signs anticipate the usual position by fifteen degrees.
To examine all these matters minutely would not
only exceed our present limits, but require a know
ledge of practical astronomy to which the author of
this essay has no pretensions. We shall therefore be
contented to rest our argument on the testimony of
Hipparchus himself, who had read and criticised the
works of Eudoxus, which we only know from second
hand, and by imperfect quotations ; on that of Peta
vius, who has edited, carefully studied, and profound
ly commented the text of Hipparchus ; on the im
portant examples above cited, the evidence of which
the chief supporter of the opposite system has admitted
to be decisive ; but, above all, on the extreme impro
bability, that the most distinguished astronomer of his
day should have been guilty of such a puerile defe
rence to the prejudice and bigotry of a small body of
greek rustics, as to have intentionally constructed a
whole theory of the heavens on so absurd a basis.
How is so strange an admission to be reconciled with
the reputation which Eudoxus obtained as an improver
of science throughout the civilized world ? Are we
to suppose that the celebrated Octoeteris which he
composed for the use of Greece was founded on a fix
ing of the solstice fifteen days after that on which it
really fell ? Freret supposes that the barbarians of
Hellas, in the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries before
our era, had a well-regulated zodiac and calendar ;
that, in the little less rude age of Hesiod, this sup
posed sphere of Chiron received a correction propor
tioned to the alteration which had taken place in the
positions, the cardinal points being transferred from
the sixteenth to the eighth degrees ; that, in the days



188 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
of Euctemon, it received a still farther correction, the
same points being transferred to the commencement
of the constellations ; and yet we are to believe that
Eudoxus (as well as Meton) obtained a fame far sur
passing that of all preceding astronomers, merely by
going back to the old system of his barbarous forefa
thers, the fallacy of which his countrymen had been,
during ages, endeavouring to show. Was this the
fruit of his long study in Egypt, that, on his return
to Greece, he should be more willing to confirm his
fellow-countrymen in error and bigotry, than impart
to them the benefit of his lessons among the theban
priesthood ? The highest praise which poetical hy
perbole could devise for the author of the julian ca
lendar was, that his merit equalled that of Eudoxus :1
and did such glory belong to the mere reproduction
of a method which had been corrected or exploded as
erroneous during ten centuries ? Geminus, who lived
about three hundred years after Eudoxus, speaksTM of
the solstice, as regulated by his observations, assisted
by those of the Egyptians, as having been a standard
of correctness with his countrymen for long after
wards. This solstice, Petavius," for sound reasons,
has fixed, not far from the true time, towards the end
of December ; but, upon the other system, we must
transfer it to the second week in January,—a compu
tation which never could have been a subject of any
thing but ridicule to Geminus. This author, how
ever, furnishes us with farther evidence that Eudoxus

was guilty of no such absurdity, who, according to
him," placed the spring equinox in the sixth of Aries,

is this to be reconciled with the above designation of
the sixteenth degrees ? Freret would suppose an
other rustic calendar, of which he has a supply ready
to help him out of all difficulties. As there is, how
ever, not the least evidence that Eudoxus ever con
structed but one sphere or calendar, or ever assigned
but one real position to the cardinal points, this very
circumstance shows that the variety of his zodiac
consisted but in terms. Had Eudoxus, in one of his
works, fixed his colures in the sixth, in another in the
sixteenth, of Aries, it is not to be believed that Hip
parchus, in his commentary on them, should have
omitted to mention so important a circumstance.
The statement of Geminus, therefore, rightly inter
preted, might clear up the difficulty. He, no doubt,
means here to assign what he considered the true po
sition of the colures of Eudoxus, according to the re
ceived division of the constellations, which that as
tronomer had recomposed as signs after a form of his
own. Accordingly, Petaviusp has observed, that, con
sistently with the method of the ancients, who count
ed their degrees of longitude on the equator, and not
on the ecliptic, the sixth of Aries and the fourth of
Capricorn (as constellations) would be as near an ap
proximation to the true positions, for the time of Eu
doxus, as could well be expected from the rude me
thods of observation in those days.

form, that I discovered that the celebrated M. De
lambre had devoted a long article of his History of
ancient astronomy to this very point, where, by a far
more scientific, but not more impartial, analysis of the
same authorities here appealed to, he has been led to
a precisely similar conclusion. I shall quote at some
length the passage containing the summary of his re
marks ; for, having naturally felt some diffidence in
venturing to oppose my opinion to that of distinguish
ed astronomers in a matter any way connected with
their own science, it is gratifying to be able to adduce
in its support testimony of at least equal weight, as
far as the present question is concerned. M. Delam
bre attributes more, perhaps, than I have done to the
extreme rudeness of the methods of observation in
the days of Eudoxus, and less to the discrepancies in
the arrangement of the constellations ; but the result
is the same. After examining very minutely the de
scriptions of Hipparchus,q which form the basis of the
i Histoire de l'astron. ancienne, torn. i. p. 123, sq. Dans toutes ces
remarques sur le tropique d'Eudoxe on ne trouve pas une seule position
un peu précise. Sa sphère devait donc avoir été faite à vue et sans
aucun instrument.... Mais les données d'Eudoxe ne s'accordent pas entre
elles ; c'est qu'il n'a point regardé le ciel, qu'il a receuilli les observations
grossières faites à vue, peut-être en différens tems et en différons pays.
Il n'est pas étonnant qu' avec des élémens aussi imparfaits, il ait donné
des discordances énormes ; ce qui étonne davantage, c'est la peine in
utile que se sont donnée quelques modernes, pour expliquer tout cela, en
supposant des observations faites à des époques éloignées les unes des
autres. Il faudrait autant d'époques différentes qu' Eudoxe a nommé
d'étoiles. On s'est accordé à prendre pour idée fondamentale que les
observations étaient bonnes. Il était bien plus naturel de les supposer
mauvaises ; mais alors on n'aurait pu bâtir aucun système.
Enfin on ne verra qu'une manière différente de compter les signes et
les degrés entre Hipparque et Eudoxe ; le premier mettait les points
équinoxiaux et solsticiaux dans le milieu des signes. Il étend le signe
d'été, celui des plus longs jours, Stçtirxrct comme dit Aratus, à 15° de
part et d'autre du point solsticial.... Hipparque, au contraire, qui avait

theories of Newton, Whiston, and Freret, he ob
serves : "In all these remarks on the sphere of
Eudoxus, we do not find a single position tolerably
correct. His sphere, therefore, must have been con
structed by the naked eye, without any instrument.
But his statements do not even agree with each
other, which arises from his not having studied the
heavens, but merely put together rude observations,
made at sight, perhaps at different times, and in dif
ferent countries. It is not surprising that with such
imperfect elements the whole should be so discordant ;
but what is really surprising, is the useless trouble
which the moderns have taken to explain all this, by
supposing observations made at different epochs, and
in countries far distant from each other. We should
require as many different epochs as Eudoxus has men
tioned stars. These authors have set out with the
fundamental idea that the observations were correct ;
it had been more reasonable to have supposed them
erroneous. But then there would have been no room
for the construction of a system It will be seen,
that Eudoxus and Hipparchus differed but in their
method of reckoning the degrees and signs. The
former placed the equinoctial and solstitial points in
the middle of the signs ; extending the sign of sum
mer, or of the longest days, Siciitoltov as Aratus calls
it, toHifipfptaerenchduesg,reoens tohneeoatchhersihdeanodf,thseawsotlshteitpiarlopproiientt.y

of placing the point zero of the zodiac, and of the
equator, at the intersection of these two circles
so that the fifteen degrees of Eudoxus, do not denote
that Hipparchus, and he himself, really assigned to
the solstice essentially different positions. The
position was the same, in the cypher alone lay the
difference. This is what chronologers, who had
scarcely a notion of astronomy, have not been able,
and astronomers, under the influence of system, have
not been willing, to See." Thus far Delambre ; and
whoever takes the trouble to compare his illustrations
with those of Whiston and Freret, and with the text
of the original authors, which forms the groundwork
of the whole, will no doubt arrive at the same con
clusion.
It remains now to offer a few observations on a
passage of Columella, which Freret,1 and those who
adopt his views, are accustomed to quote confident
ly in favour of their argument, that the ancients were
careless of nicety in the calculation of the seasons,
and more willing to humour than to correct the pre
judices of the vulgar ; but which, I shall endeavour
to shew, they have either never read at all in the
original work of Columella, or have altogether mis
conceived its import ; as it not only, when rightly
understood, bears a totally different sense from what
they have assigned it, but, like the parallel texts of
Hipparchus, is altogether at variance with their
theory. The passage, or rather the portion of it
usually adduced, is as follows :' Nee me fallit Hip
parchi ratio, quse docet, solstitia et sequinoctia non
octavis, sed primis partibus signorum confici. Verum

in hac ruris disciplina, sequor nunc Eudoxi et Me
tdnis, antiquorumque fastos astrologorum, qui sunt
apfcati publicis sacrifices, quia et notior est ista vetus
agricolis concepta opinio ; nec taraen Hipparchi sub
tilitas pinguioribus, ut aiunt, rusticorum Uteris neces
saria est." That is, as these critics have understood
him : " that instead of following the correct calen
dars of his own time, regulated upon the principles of
Hipparchus, according to whom the cardinal points
were fixed at the first degrees of the signs ; he pre
ferred adhering to the old vulgar or rustic calendar,
regulated according to observations of ancient; greek
astronomers, where the equinoxes and solstices were
placed seven degrees beyond their proper places for
the time at which he wrote.'" This observation, if the
above were the real import of his words, (which we
shall hereafter see it was not,) would, in as far as
regards Meton, be tolerably correct ; for as that phi
losopher lived towards five hundred years before Co
lumella, the precession of equinoxes amounted be
tween the age of the two, very nearly to seven degrees.
As for the coupling the name of Eudoxus with that
' Freret, p. 469, sqq.—This is in fact the interpretation given, not only
by Freret generally throughout his observations, but more especially by
Professor Ideler, (Untersuch. uber die astr. Beob. &c. s. 335, ff.) who
adopts his views, and makes Columella say : that " the colures of the Old
calendars of Meton and Eudoxus, differed eight (seven) degrees of longi
tude from the correct reckoning of his own time ;" beziehen sich auf eine
Lage der equinoctial und solstitial punkte, welche um acht grad ostlich
von der jetzigen abweicht. But in the very next page it is stated, that
Meton must have followed a calendar constructed for the tenth century
b. c, wherein the cardinal points were placed in the eighth degrees of
the constellations according to their actual arrangement. Now that
would make a difference, as observed in our text, of fourteen, and not
seven degrees, between the calendar of Meton and the true positions in
the days of Columella. How the learned professor reconciles these two
statements I am at a loss to understand.



19* ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
of Meton, it can here be nothing but a confusion of
ideas on the part of Columella, for the best authori
ties do not, as we have already seen, admit of the be
lief that he ever followed such an arrangement. But,
in the case of Meton ; would not this very statement,
even as here interpreted, afford sufficient proof of the
correctness of the opinion above advanced, respecting
his method of dividing the zodiac ? namely, that he
made the commencement of the signs anticipate the
colures by seven degrees. For if he had placed his
colures, as Freret supposed, seven degrees out of their
proper place in the heavens for his own age, and Co
lumella in his rustic calendar placed them where
Meton did, then Columella would have differed four
teen, and not seven degrees only, from the correct
calendar of his own time. If, therefore, in conform
ity with the sense of the passage adopted by these
critics, the difference between the calendar of Meton
and the correct reckoning for the days of Columella,
amounted to only seven degrees, nearly what it ought
to have done according to the laws of precession, it
were clear that Meton must have fixed his cardinal
points, as nearly as his means of observation permit
ted, to their proper positions in the sphere.
But the fact is, that this very rustic reckoning of
Columella himself, as opposed to the improved method
of Hipparchus, relates, like the corresponding varieties
of Meton and Eudoxus, not to a wilfully erroneous
calculation of the cardinal points of the year, but
merely to the preference of an old fashioned arrange
ment of the signs themselves ; according to which those
points were fixed at the eighth, instead of the first
degrees. This is evident from the remainder of the
text of Columella, which has been generally only



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. V. 195
quoted by halves ; and where he mentions not only
the degrees of the zodiac, but the days of the months,
to which the equinoxes and solstices were fixed.
Speaking of the management of bees with respect to the various seasons of the year, he observes ;u that
the vernal equinox takes place in the month of March,
viii Calend. April., in the eighth degree of Aries ;
Mense Martico circa viii Cal. Apr., in octava parte'
Arietis conficitur. A little lower down he fixes the
autumnal equinox in the viii Cal. Oct. The winter
solstice in the viii Cal. Jan., about the eighth degree
of Capricorn ; brumam quae fere conficitur circa viii
Cal. Jan. in octava parte Capricorni. After which he
adds as above : nee me fallit Hipparchi ratio, &c.
The eighth Calends of April was the twenty-fifth of
March, to which day the equinox was fixed in the
Julian calendar. The true equinox, according to the
correct computation of modern astronomers, fell
somewhat earlier, but the constructor of the Julian calendar supposed his reckoning to be right,v and so
did Columella ; there is no wilful error on either
side. Columella therefore, instead of differing seven
degrees from the accurate standard of the day, coin
cided with it exactly. He differed only from Hip
parchus, in following an old and vulgar arrangement
of the signs, instead of the improved system recom
mended by that astronomer. His countrymen of the
same period did precisely the same, as is clear from a
multitude of passages of Ovid, Pliny, and others,"

which assign the equinoxes and solstices to their pro
per days according to the julian reckoning, but to the
eighth degrees of the signs. Indeed there is no rea
son to doubt, but that Sosigenes constructed the new
roman or julian calendar on that principle ; finding
that it harmonized with the ancient usage of Latium,
borrowed, it may be supposed, from Greece in the
early ages of the republic.
Freret has followed up his remarks upon this pas
sage of Columella by a long catalogue of the errors
and inconsistencies of that author, and of the calen
dars in use among the italian peasantry in his day,
ascribing most of them to a bigoted adherence to the
supposed fasti of Meton, adapted, as he conceives, to
the positions in the age of Hesiod, about ten cen
turies b. c. ; the cardinal points being in those days
in the eighth degrees of the constellations. As how
ever Columella, in the only passage where he men
tions Meton, happens to be right in his computation
of the seasons, it is hardly fair to assume that all his
mistakes rest on the authority of that philosopher.
Accordingly, in a subsequent page,* where the critic
notices the circumstance that the Parapegma of Meton
was engraved in letters of gold, and posted up at
Olympia for the public use of Greece, he admits that
the vulgar calendar, which he supposes Columella to
have considered as emanating from Meton, must have
been falsely ascribed to that astronomer. It would
indeed be surprising if the public authorities of the
greek confederacy had recorded in letters of gold, as
a new discovery, a system which was as old as Hesiod,
and had been no better than a vulgar error ever since
1
* P. 483.



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. V. 197
the days of that poet. Yet this very golden para
pegma was the same which Meton regulated by the
eighth degrees of the signs or constellations, at least
we hear of no other ascribed to him. Of the actual
degree of merit it possessed, we may judge from the
statement of Ptolemy,y whose authority will not be
disputed, that Meton's observation of the solstice,
though rude, was accurate enough to be of some
assistance to Hipparchus in making his celebrated
computation of the precession of equinoxes. The
same Ptolemy21 assigns it to the morning of a day of
the era of Nabonassar, identified by Petavius with the
twenty-seventh of June, who has also shown the ob
servation itself to be sufficiently correct." Unless,
therefore, we suppose that Meton was guilty of the
absurdity of fixing his cardinal points to the just day
of the year, while he placed them seven degrees out
of their positions in the heavens, we must admit that
the method of this astronomer is as inconsistent with
the argument of Freret, as that of Eudoxus has been shown to be.b

applied by the astronomer to the observation of Meton, were intended
to signify, that it was incorrect by several days ; whereas it is clear that
he applies it only to inaccuracies of minutes, or at the most, hours, as
compared with the greater precision of Hippavchus.

198 ON THE CALENDAR AND ZODIAC
barbarous ages of Greece, as well as of the blind
deference of the philosophers of her civilized ages to
these imaginary ancient calendars, and of their wil
lingness to sacrifice the interests of science to the
superstition and prejudice of the vulgar, falls to the
ground ; or even resolves itself into evidence of the
very reverse of all this, namely, of an arbitrary and
presumptuous spirit of innovation in those very sages,
who were not contented with the old and simple
method borrowed from the Egyptians or Chaldees,
and sanctioned by the earliest astrologers of their
own nation, in conformity with which, as we learn
from the express testimony of Hipparchus, the car
dinal points were placed at the commencement of the
signs ; but each, according to his own fancy, thought
proper to construct his sphere and portion his zodiac
in such a way as he found most convenient, or was
most congenial to his own taste. Nor can we have
stronger evidence of the recent introduction of the
zodiac into Greece than this very fact, that the dis
tribution of its signs or constellations, it matters not
which, was, in the age of Euctemon, Meton, and
Eudoxus, so very arbitrary ; had these constellations
been accurately defined and familiar to all ranks of
men, to the rustic or the navigator as to the sage,
during ten centuries, it is not likely that these most
popular authors of the day should so strangely have
confounded them. It would appear, then, that though
the Greeks, about the time of Thales, adopted the
astronomical symbols of the twelve divisions of the
seasons from their more ancient neighbours, they
did not at first understand their exact use. All that
seems to have been known was, that the ecliptic con
tained twelve parts, equal perhaps according to some,



OF ANCIENT EGYPT. SECT. V. - 199
unequal according to others ; which, under the name
of gods, animals, or other objects, bore a certain
reference to particular seasons ; but the more exact
arrangement of the gods, animals, &c. themselves,
with respect to the three hundred and sixty degrees,
previous to the days of Hipparchus, depended very
much upon the fancy of individual astrologers.
Unless, therefore, some very important facts or
authorities, unknown to me, as well as to those who
have advocated the opposite opinions, have been
omitted in the foregoing inquiry, it will hardly be
denied, in spite of the force of association or of pre
judice, that the internal evidence, both negative and
positive, of primitive greek tradition, as well as the
testimony of the most reasonable and trustworthy of
the classical authors who have treated of these mat
ters, and who are seldom backward in assigning a
due share of antiquity to their own institutions, is at
direct variance with the belief, that the constellations
of the zodiac of Greece were either of native inven
tion, or known in that country at any very remote
period.
Having thus examined, to the best of our ability,
the probable origin and primitive form of the Egyp
tian zodiac, and the period and circumstances of its
first introduction into Europe, I shall conclude this
essay with a few remarks on the signs or cyphers by
which its twelve portions are still represented, and
which are in fact mere hieroglyphics of the seasons,
as were those of the Egyptians of old, and appear to
be of very considerable antiquity. Salmasius,0 Montfaucon,d and other learned men distinguished for their

knowledge of ancient codices, state that they occur
familiarly in both greek and latin manuscripts ; and
Du Cange has inserted them among the Sigla veterum
appended to his glossary of the middle and lower greek idiom.e M. Delambref observes that the only
greek work where he had observed these symbols
is the commentary of Proclus on the Apotelesmata
attributed to Ptolemy ; they occur, however, in other
published greek authors, as in the treatise of Ptolemy
himself; in the old preface to which, a table of
the signs of the zodiac, with their influences, is also
offered for the convenience of the reader, " accord
ing to the method transmitted by Ptolemy as the
most accurate." Hence we may infer that Ptolemy
himself, or whoever may be the author of the tetra
biblion, also used them. They are to be seen in the
Elementa of Geminus,8 attached to various diagrams
whereby that mathematician illustrates the argument
of his text, and which are clearly his own, as he
expressly refers to them. That his editor Petavius
should have inserted cyphers different from what
existed in the original, there is the less reason to
suppose, since some of them differ considerably in
their forms from those in modern use. That of
Capricorn especially, consisting of two distinct por
tions, seems to refer to what I have above conjec
tured to be the original egyptian form of the symbol,
namely, two different animals, combined by the Greeks
into one amphibious monster. This variety also
appears in the cyphers of Ptolemy, and is stated by Salmasiush to be usual with greek authors, while the

Latins employ the ordinary figure, which would
imply the superior antiquity of the former. The
zodiacal cyphers are also attached to geometrical
figures in Theon's commentary on the Almagest.
Macrobius1 expressly refers to them under the name
of notae or marks, as distinct from the alphabetic
letters, in his illustrations of a similar diagram, where
both are used. They appear also on the Abraxas, or basilidian gems, published by Montfaucon. k Bailly
gives, in his History of ancient astronomy,1 a fragment
of a zodiac sculptured on marble, also published by Kircher,m which, if it be faithfully represented in his
engraving, may, from its form and execution, be con
sidered as not of the most barbarous age of roman
art, where we have, as emblems of some of the con
stellations, apparently the same images represented
in full, of which we have the abbreviations in our
own cyphers ; as the horns of the Ram, the head or
front of the Bull ; while in some of the other divi
sions are groups, which have no apparent connexion
with either greek or egyptian mythology. The Twins,
for instance, are two sitting figures of animals resem
bling apes. Cancer contains the head of a bird, and
the tail of some reptile or insect. Libra and Aquarius
are the same as our own. Virgo consists of three
ears of corn united by a fillet ; the same number is
common on ancient monuments as an emblem of fer
tility or plenty, and as an attribute of Isis, as, for ex
ample, in the figure of Mesori, or Isis nursing Horus, formerly alluded to ;n and in a picture belonging to an

ancient manuscript of Hyginus, according to Salma
sius,° the figure of Virgo is represented bearing an
equal number in her hand. Of these the modern sign
of Virgo is doubtless an abbreviation. The only edit
ed work of arabic astrology where I have had oppor
tunity to observe the zodiacal cyphers, is the Globus
cfelestis cuficoarabicus, published by Assemanni. Sca
liger asserts that the signs of the planets are also com
mon in the most ancient manuscripts. They occur,
too, in gems,p with the exception of that of the orb
which we inhabit.
It seems very doubtful how far these symbols, in
their present form, hieroglyphics as they are, ought
to be considered, as they frequently have been, of pure
egyptian origin. Aquarius, among those of the zo
diac, is evidently so ; to which we may, perhaps, add
Libra, from its resemblance to one of the figures of
the theban tomb. The sign Cancer, too, as stated in
our remarks on that portion of the zodiac, seems to
be an abbreviation of the hieratic character Scarabee.
Among the planets, the Sun and Moon are certainly
the egyptian hieroglyphics of those luminaries ; but
the globe and crescent suggest themselves so natural
ly to the human imagination, as concise methods of
representing those familiar objects, that hardly any
inference can be drawn from that circumstance re
specting their origin. It must, however, be observed,
that the sign of the terrestrial globe, which does not
appear to have been in use among the more ancient
greek or roman astrologers, is the same as that which

Porphyryq states to have been the egyptian symbol of
region, country, earth ; whose testimony has also
been confirmed by recent discoveries.1 Salmasius,
however, states, that it occurs in old mathematical
works as the representative of Sphere, Circle.8 The
sign of Venus (?) is the well-known egyptian em
blem of life, the globe and cross. Salmasius' supposes
it to be a corruption of <£, the initial of <pvtr<p6gog, one
of the titles of the planet, a notion more fanciful than
plausible. That of Saturn is precisely the same as
the modern Coptic letter Tj, the representative of the
old hieratic V). Salmasius would have it a contrac
tion of the Kg. of Kfovog. Mercury (?) is apparently
the caduceus, which may more reasonably be suppos
ed a greek than an egyptian emblem, being an inva
riable attribute of this deity in the greek mythology,
while there is no trace of its connexion with the Thot
of the banks of the Nile. The same author mention
ed above supposes this cypher to represent the St of
2t/a&w, an epithet of Mercury, which is still less ad
missible than his other derivations, the more since, as
he himself observes, it presupposes a latin and not a
greek S. There is more speciousness in his supposi
tion, that Mars ( $ ) is a contraction of the &g of &ov
gog, and Jupiter (^) of the radical letters of the word
ZiOg, as in ancient manuscripts their respective forms
frequently show traces of such an origin." Scaliger's derivationsv are, for the most part, very imaginary.

There appears to be an inclination in some quarters to doubt,
or to deny altogether, the existence of such a thing as a year
of three hundred and sixty days, among the Egyptians, or
any other nation of antiquity ; but not having been able to
perceive any reasonable ground for this scepticism, I have
been willing to adhere to the commonly received opinion. This
mode of reckoning certainly seems such as would offer itself
instinctively to the human understanding, when making the
first advances in the arts of civilized life. After the computa
tion by nights and days, the first step towards a more artificial
division of time would be the observation of the courses of the
moon. The synodic month is twenty-nine days and a half;
but as it is not to be supposed that barbarians would calculate
fractions of days, they would therefore reckon their month in
round numbers at thirty days. In the same way they would
observe that the moon changed twelve times in the course of
the year. They would therefore naturally assign their year
twelve months. This account of the first rude formation of a calendar seems so simple and obvious,a that one might feel
surprised that its accuracy should be questioned, even were it

not supported by a mass of tradition and authority, both
greek and barbarian, such as can hardly be brought* to bear
on any other equally remote point of antiquity. That any
people should be willing long to adhere to so imperfect a form
of year, without correction of any kind, is no doubt highly
improbable. Those who were anxious that its revolutions
should correspond with the changes of the seasons, would en
deavour to effect this, in as far as their imperfect means of
calculating these changes would permit, by some vague and
irregular mode of intercalation, by months or days, as judged
necessary from time to time. As they advanced in politeness,
they would fall upon more accurate and settjed methods : those .
who, like the Egyptians, preferred a purely solar year, by the
permanent addition of the five epagomenae, or days extraor
dinary,, attached to no month ; others, whose habits led them
to regulate their feasts with reference to the phases of the
moon, as well as of the sun, might, like the Greeks, make
their months alternately of thirty and twenty-nine days, their
year of three hundred and fifty-four, and keep it to its posi
tions by lunisolar cycles. This, accordingly, has been the
opinion generally entertained by the learned concerning the
gradual progress made by these two nations respectively to
wards the final settlement of their calendar. Professor Idelerb is the only chronologer, as far as I know,
who has declared himself decidedly, and in detail, against the
existence, at any period, of this form of year of three hundred
and sixty days ; and yet his authorities, which he adduces, as
upon all other occasions, with great fidelity and impartiality,
appear to me altogether in favour of, rather than adverse to,
the opinions which he endeavours to confute. With respect
to the egyptian calendar, after entering at some length into
the inquiry at what time it may reasonably be supposed to have
been finally arranged by the addition of the epagomenae, he
appears to decide in favour of the date assigned by De la Nauze, namely, the year 1322 b. c.c But, in another place,

verting the views of Desvignoles, a strenuous supporter of the
year of three hundred and sixty days, he adduces the well
known egyptian fable, that the five epagomenas were the birth
days of five principal deities, as proof that " the supplement
ary days were introduced before all historical ages, at a period
concerning which only a dim tradition has been preserved.""1
But, even admitting this, the question would be only with re
spect to the period, as they were still supplementary days to
an older and deficient reckoning. What that reckoning was,
the subsequent form of the egyptian calendar itself seems to
declare, namely, a year of three hundred and sixty days. This,
however, M. Ideler does not admit ; but, from some confu
sion or inaccuracy in a passage of Plutarch, where the fable
is narrated, would have the ancient measure of time to have
been a lunar year. The account of Plutarche is, that " Rhea
having fallen with child to Saturn, the Sun inflicted the curse
upon her, that she should produce neither on month nor year ;
but Mercury, playing at dice with the Moon, gains from her
the seventieth part of her light, out of which he formed five
days, which were added to the three hundred and sixty, and
called epagomenae, and honoured as the birth-days of five dei
ties ; on the first was born Osiris, on the second Arueris, on
the third Typhon, on the fourth Isis, on the fifth Nephthys.''
Five, however, are the seventy-second, not the seventieth part
of three hundred and sixty ; and, accordingly, Scaligerf reads
sGdofirixoerw diungov for the edited iZdoiMri»o<Srbv of Plutarch ; and
there can be little doubt that this was at least the sense of the
author. M. Ideler, however, supposes Plutarch to mean a
lunar year, which would consist of three hundred and fifty
days, five being the seventieth part of three hundred and fifty.
But have we any better authority for a lunar year of three
hundred and fifty days in antiquity, than for a lunisolar year
of three hundred and sixty ? Have we, indeed, a shadow of
authority for any such mode of computation ? and is the ex
istence of such an one more credible than of that which the
professor rejects? Besides, the five added to the old year would,

upon this principle, have made it consist of only three hun
dred and fifty-five, not three hundred and sixty-five days. In
no case can the tradition be reasonable or intelligible, unless
it be understood as of an addition of the five epagomense to an
original three hundred and sixty. Diodorus informs us, that
in the city of Acanthus were three hundred and sixty priests,
whose office, according to ancient usage, was, one on each day
of the year to bring water from the Nile, and pour it into a
vessel perforated with holes ; and we find superstitions of a
somewhat similar nature, with an equal number of ministers,
established in other places.* Why the number of these priests
should have been limited to three hundred and sixty, rather
than three hundred and sixty-five, unless at the remote period
of antiquity, when the rite was instituted, the egyptian year
had consisted of the former rather than the latter number of
days,—or why they should have omitted five days in a custom
which, as Diodorus remarks, was meant to comprehend every
day in the year, — I am unable to see.
With respect to the greek year, this argument appears
equally unsatisfactory. There exists a great mass of unques
tionable evidence, that, according to the unanimous voice of
the most ancient tradition, twelve months, consisting of thirty
days each, formed the basis of the primitive hellenic calendar,
the only attempt ever made to invalidate which resolves itself
into an hypothesis, that the sum three hundred and sixty, or
twelve times thirty, was adopted in vulgar language as a con
venient mode of reckoning years and months in round num
bers, though unknown in practical use at any period,—a con
jecture which is as inadequate to explain away the positive
terms in which the year of three hundred and sixty days is

that modern travellers have observed traces of these curious rites still
existing in Egypt, as transferred to the superstitions of the Coptic church.

spoken of as an historical reality, as to account for the con
stancy and universality of the tradition itself, even after the
greek reckoning became purely lunar of three hundred and
fifty-four days, with months alternately of thirty and twenty
nine.11
M. Meier's general and most forcible objections appear to
refer, not so much to the existence of this form of year among
any people, as to the improbability that any should long have
adhered to it without intercalation, which was a part of the
system of Desvignolesj' to confute whom his arguments have
chiefly been directed. I regret not having had an opportunity
of referring to the work of Desvignoles here alluded to ; in
this respect, however, I feel inclined to agree with his oppo
nent, but differ only in supposing that the year of three hun
dred and sixty days is, as well with reference to tradition as to
its own internal evidence, more likely to have been the basis
of the improved calendar of the Egyptians, than the lunar
year proposed by himself; and that, with this original simple
form, a people in the infancy of civilization might, in feeling
their way to improvement, have tried various modes of inter
calation to adapt it to the seasons, and a considerable time
might have elapsed before they established the five epago
menas as a substitute for all others.
As for the argument in favour of the transcendant an
tiquity of this last-mentioned institution, derived from the
circumstance that the five days themselves were fabled
the birth-days of Osiris, Isis, and other distinguished dei
ties, I confess it appears to me altogether fallacious. It
can only be valid on the supposition, that the year of three
hundred and sixty-five days is as ancient in Egypt as the
worship or knowledge of the deities themselves, which would
involve a very great paradox. The worship of Osiris and
Isis, the very elements or essence of the egyptian godhead,
may safely be supposed as ancient as the religion of the Egypt

ians, and, consequently, more ancient than their first adoption
of the habits of civilized life, since the superstitions of every
people, if of native growth, (as there can be no doubt those of
Egypt were,) originating in their barbarism, are afterwards
transferred and engrafted on their political institutions. But
who can doubt that the year of three hundred and sixty-five
days is the work of an already advanced state of civilization,
when the egyptian pantheon (as shall be made evident from
the names of the months, in the sequel of the text) existed in
all its integrity ? and it were the height of extravagance to
maintain, that, at this epoch, the godhead of Osiris and Isis,
the very basis of that pantheon, and of whom all its members
were little more than personifications, could be unknown on
the banks of the Nile. The celebration, therefore, of the na
tivity of the five deities on the epagomenae can only be rea
sonably understood as of some form of consecration of the new
days, or commemoration of their introduction, at whatever
period that introduction may have taken place. Similar feasts
were common in the egyptian calendar, as the birth of Harpocrates, the birth of the eyes of Horus,k the death of Osiris.
How unreasonable it were to take this sort of tradition by the
letter, as involving allusions to real events, we may judge by
examining the details of the above fable, as related by Plu
tarch.1 We have seen that Rhea having become pregnant
by Saturn, the Sun cursed her ; but, by the good offices of
Mercury, she was enabled to bring forth her five children,
Osiris, Aroueris, Typhon, Isis, Nephthys, on five successive
days. Yet, in the same chapter, we are told, that Osiris and
Aroueris were the sons of the Sun, Isis of Hermes ; and that,
while yet in their mother's womb, Isis and Osiris had con
nexion, the fruit of which was Aroueris, who just before was
called brother of Osiris, and offspring both of Saturn and of
the Sun ! Who does not see that all these legends are ob
scure enigmas, bearing reference to no historical facts, but to
physical or astronomical phenomena, and so confusedly repeated
by Plutarch, as to have become still more dark and mysterious
than from their very nature they must originally have been.

APPENDIX. NO. II. 213
Diodorus also gives this fable, but more briefly, and in somewhat different terms. According to him,m Saturn, hav
ing married his sister Rhea, begat Osiris and Isis, or, as others
asserted, Jupiter and Juno, from whom were born the same
five deities mentioned by Plutarch. And both authors agree
in stating," that no sooner was Osiris born, than he set about
preventing men from eating each other ; and Isis contributed
her share towards raising them from a level with the brutes,
by teaching them the art of cultivating corn. So that, if his
torical value be assigned to the tradition, it would, if it prove
the antiquity of the egyptian year at all, also prove that the
people by whom it was established were cannibals, barbarians
of the lowest and most degraded caste !

It is singular enough that this author, one of the most dis
tinguished chronologers of a nation, among whose failings a
disregard of truth is by no means conspicuous, should, through
out his otherwise learned and valuable works, so often broadly
and positively advance as acknowledged facts, statements to
tally devoid of all reasonable probability, if not utterly and
palpably false. According to him, previous to the arrival of
Cecrops, the Athenians had a year of three hundred and sixty
days ; after his improvements, it consisted of three hundred
and sixty-five, that is, twelve months, and five epagomenae, as
among the Egyptians. Thales introduced the tropical year of
three hundred and sixty-five days and a quarter, which was
again altered by Solon into a lunar year of three hundred and
fifty-four days. The year of three hundred and sixty-five,
similar to that of Attica under Cecrops, was, he asserts, also
established at Rome by Numa. Upon all this one observa
tion will be sufficient : Fides sit penes auctorem.

The language of some of the ancient commentators seems
also to hint at this, who assert that the rising of Sothis was
the new-year's-day of the Egyptians ; as Porphyry," Nowhjvms

Some authors, however, and among them De la Nauzep him

able and sacred, dating from the first of Thot for the time
being ; the other fixed, and in civil use, commencing with the
day on which Sirius rose heliacally. The falsehood of this opinion has been amply shown by Idelerq and Biot ;r and be

this opinion, states/ that the Egyptians were in error in sup
posing that the coincidence of the first of Thot with the helia
cal rising of Sirius took place after 1461 revolutions of their
civil year ; according to him, it would only have required 1424.
The error is the critic's own, who supposes the visible heliacal
year of the star in that age and latitude to have been 365d 6h

The attempt of Idelery to discover an allusion to the so
thiac cycle in the fable of Herodotus concerning the rising of
the sun in the west, is not fortunate ; and the less so that it
is grounded on an uncritical interpretation of the grammatical
structure of the passage in which that fable is contained. So
that, as Biot has observed,2 concerning another equally un
successful attempt : " Si Tenigme proposee a Herodote n'est
pas une de ces forfanteries, dont les memes pretres se mon
traient si prodigues envers lui et les autres voyageurs, elle
reste encore a interpreter.'' The same author has shown in a
satisfactory manner, that all similar endeavours to assign mys
terious significations to this fable must be vain ; since* " le
nombre que Ton pretend interpreter, n'est pas dans Penonce
egyptien, et qu'il resulte seulement du mode arbitraire devalu
ation qu' Herodote y applique." The truth of this remark
will be apparent to whoever collates the egyptian chronology of
Herodotus, the basis of which is his own computation of a hun
dred years to three generations, with the dynasties, as given
by the native authorities, Manetho and the Old Chronicle.

21 6 APPENDIX. NO. VI.
Dr. Hales' b interpretation of the riddle is still less plausible.
After reproving preceding chronologers for having " idly taxed
the relation of the priests, as a falsehood, a dream, or a fable,"
he himself, without any ceremony, reduces the three hundred and
forty-one generations of this most veracious hierarchy to about
fifty, and the eleven thousand three hundred and forty years
of Herodotus to seventeen hundred, and then applies the so
thiac cycle to the result, in a manner which, to me at least, is
not very intelligible. It is evident, however, that by this
arbitrary mode of proceeding, any falsehood, any dream, or
any paradox however absurd, may be constituted an ingenious
riddle and solved accordingly.
For my part I am at a loss to see, how the statement that
the. sun had risen where he now sets, and set where he now
rises, can by any exercise of subtilty be made to bear reference
to the anomalies of the cycle. As the seasons shifted their
position in the egyptian year, the sun. might be said to effect
his summer where formerly his winter conversions, and to pro
duce autumn where formerly spring. But the sun rose in the
east and set in the west, at one period of the cycle as at an
other, and by no ingenuity can the contrary statement be
shown to be any thing but a gross falsehood.
I confess I feel inclined to believe with Scaliger, Stilling
fleet, and other sagacious critics, whose opinion Dr. Hales
treats so lightly, that here, as in other similar instances noticed
above,0 the priests were merely endeavouring to amuse them
selves, at the expense of the credulity and simplicity of their
greek admirers.

The opinion of De la Nauze, which I had imagined to have
few or no supporters, has however lately acquired importance,
* Analys. of Chron. vol. i. p. 39. vol. iv. p. 412, sqq. c Sup. page 23, Note m.



APPENDIX. NO. VI. 217
from its having been adopted by the distinguished german
chronologer mentioned in the foregoing note ;d who is inclined
to the belief, that the ancient mode of calculation, used by the
astronomers of Chaldsea, since about the year 2240 b. c, which
he assigns as the date of their earliest celestial observations,
having been found deficient and imperfect in 747 b. c, had
then been abandoned ; and the egyptian solar year substituted
as a more simple and convenient mode of computation. My
reasons for preferring the opinion stated in the text are as
follows.
First ; the great improbability that the Chaldees, who were
much better astronomers than the Egyptians, (as seems clear
from the very fact that Hipparchus and Ptolemy made the
babylonish observations the basis of their improved systems,
while those of the Egyptians are not so much as hinted at,)
should, after no less than fifteen hundred years of their own
experience, have been reduced to the necessity of adopting
from their less scientific neighbours, a new form of computa
tion. Still less, had they even been reduced to this necessity,
is it likely, that they would have found it expedient also to
fix the commencement of their new year on the same day, and
to call their months by the same names as the Egyptians.
The very circumstance that the regulator of the nabonassa
rean aera is the Thot of 7^7 B. c,j or tne twenty-sixth of Fe
bruary Julian, appears in itself strong evidence that the whole
system is of alexandrian, rather than of chaldee original. It
is scarcely credible, that a proud and superstitious hierarchy
should at so advanced a period of their own civilization, not
only servilely adopt a foreign calendar, with foreign names of
the months ; but those names the titles of strange gods, mem
bers of the pantheon of their ancient and national enemies.
This were the more improbable, since, as Hyde' has shown,
their subjects the Persians had used from a remote period of
antiquity the year of three hundred and sixty-five days ; so

"'
that it would have been unnecessary to travel to a far distant
and foreign country, in search of so simple an institution.
Secondly ; the terms of the text of Ptolemy, from whom
all our information respecting this era is derived, appear in
consistent with such a belief. That author, (or rather Hip
parchus whom he follows) invariably distinguishes between
the era as that of Nabonassar, dnb NaSoraowagou, and the year
as that peculiar to the Egyptians, xa,f Alyunriouc and in so
pointed a manner, as can hardly admit of a suspicion, that
the latter was common to both nations. Had the astronomical
reckoning of the Chaldees been attached to this form of year,
with the same names of the months, in their corresponding
positions with respect to the sun's course, during nearly six
centuries, it would in fact have become, in as far as Hippar
chus was concerned, in an astronomical point of view, equally,
or rather by preference, the chaldee year ; for there is not a
single observation of the Egyptians themselves recorded by
either Hipparchus or Ptolemy. So that the expressions r.ar
Aiywrhug, so often repeated by them, might have been omit
ted or changed into xara XaXda/ouj.f That this was merely a
standard reckoning, adopted for its convenience by the alexan
drian Greeks, appears, from its being applied by them pre
cisely in a similar manner, to the calendars and periods of all
the other nations without exception, whose observations of the
heavens they quote. Besides the egyptian dates, we not un
frequently find those of the athenian archons, and attic lunar
months, added for farther illustration ; but the old babylonian
civil calendar being no way familiar to the Greeks, and having
been supplanted by that of the macedonian conquerors long
before the days of Hipparchus, it had been quite useless for
him, who wrote merely for his own countrymen, (still more so
for Ptolemy,) to have assigned dates to the babylonian eclipses
' It will be observed, that the term xar' Aiyvvriovg, has more force than
that of trw» alyunrmxuiv, also frequently employed by Ptolemy. The
egyptian year, if adopted by the Chaldees, might reasonably continue to
be named sro; alywxriaKov, as distinct from their old vulgar and national
reckoning. But the computation, ««w' Aiywrriouf, or according to the
Egyptians, must refer to something peculiar to themselves.



APPENDIX. NO. VI. 21 [)
according to that obsolete mode of computation. Ptolemy»
quotes two observations of the roman mathematician Mene
laus, assigning them their dates according to the egyptian
year, without the least hint at either month or year of the
roman calendar ; but we cannot infer from this that the egyp
tian year was in use in Rome.
The history of the chaldean calendar is itself so excessively
obscure, that on these points much must be left to conjecture ;
but, at least, the mere existence of the nabonassarean asra. is
not sufficient, without farther evidence, to justify our admis
sion of so important a fact in the history of ancient civilization,
as the servile adoption of the egyptian year, with its months,
their names, and positions in the seasons, by the Chalde'es, in
the year 7^7 b. c.
In as far however as modern authorities are concerned, it
may be observed, that M. Ideler is mistaken in supposing, as he does,h that Freret was the first or only chronologerswho held the
opinion here adopted, having overlooked (not to mention our own Jackson') no less a person than Petavius,k the prince
of modern chronologers, who condemns, in strong terms, the
contrary sentiment entertained by Scaliger. Nam iEgyptiorum

As the year of three hundred and sixty-five days falls short
of the heliacal year of Sirius at the regular rate of six hours
each revolution, consistently with the visible motion of the
heavenly bodies, Sirius would rise four years successively on
the same day of the egyptian year, as, for instance, on the
first of Thot, and then pass on to the next. In framing a
cycle, therefore, for the purpose of chronological computation,
it would be necessary to establish one of the four years on
which Sirius so rose on the first of Thot, as the fundamental
epoch or first year of the period, say the first of the four. In
order to find the year of the cycle elapsed at any particular
time, we should then multiply by four the number of days
counted from the first of Thot for the time being, itself in
cluded, to the day on which Sirius rose heliacally in the year
for which the calculation was made, itself not included, adding
to the product a number equal to the times which Sirius had
already risen heliacally on that day. The sum will be the
year of the cycle required.
For example, if Sirius rose for the third time on the tenth
of Phamenoth, the seventh egyptian month, what was the
year of the cycle ?
30 x 6 + 9 = 189 days, x 4 = 756 + 3 = 759 years. So
that the date required was the seven hundred and fifty-ninth
year of the cycle.
Hence at the moment when Sirius rose heliacally for the
third time on the tenth of Phamenoth, there would have
elapsed of this cycle 758 full Julian years, and 758 egyptian
years, six months, nine days.
According to the most accurate calculations,1 Sirius rose
heliacally on the first of Thot, in the years b. c. 1325, 1324,
1323, 1322 ; and consequently in a. d. 136, 137, 138, 139,

It seems more probable that the Egyptians would choose the
first year of the coincidence as the epoch of their cycle, in
which case we ought to prefer 1325 b. c. as the basis of any
chronological computation grounded on its revolution. But
as Censorinus, the first author from whom we have any authen
tic details respecting the canicular reckoning, assumed the
year 139, and consequently 1322, as a standard, and has been
followed in this by most of the moderns, I have not been
willing to depart from the received method.

I must not here overlook the circumstance, that many
authors,TM assuming that Sothis the star and Thot the deity
were originally connected in name and attribute, have inferred,
that the commencement of the egyptian year was, at its early
institution, or at least from the period of its first month having
received the name of Thot, fixed to the heliacal rising of
Sirius ; an opinion which, if admitted, would interfere very
much with those advanced in this dissertation ; but which,
I am convinced, is altogether false. It appears to rest chiefly
upon the supposition, that Sothis, like the greek appellation
of the same star, meant dog in the egyptian language ; and
that Thot or Mercury being also represented among the
Egyptians in the form of a dog, the two terms, Sothis and
Thot, must be considered as synonymous, the star being
merely a celestial representative of the god ; from whence it
is farther inferred, that the same name and mythological
character having been applied to the first day of the year,
as to the star, the one must necessarily, in the infancy of the

Not one of these assumptions, however, rests on any satis
factory evidence. On the contrary, each one of them appears
to be repugnant to the spirit, as well of the pure mythology
as of the figurative language of Egypt. That the names
Sothis, and Thot or Thoout, as written by the Egyptians, are
the same, or that either of them denoted dog will, I conceive,
hardly be maintained by any Coptic scholar of the present
day ; nor is there a single ancient authority for such a belief.
Kircher, as is well. known, interpolated several articles out of
his own imagination into the copto-arabic lexicon edited by
him, and among others, mcioeic, or nicin©l was inserted
with the signification dog attached to it ; a fraud suggested
by the above mentioned fallacious inference, that because
Sirius is called the do'gstar by the Greeks, and Sothis by the
Egyptians, Sothis must therefore denote dog in Egyptian.
Several learned men11 have been led into error by the cheat,
which was however detected, and exposed by Jablonski.0
Yet M. Klaprothp has recently advanced this word, as the
egyptian name of the animal. He admits that it rests on the
sole authority of Kircher, and that it has been surreptitiously
inserted by him in the Scala Magna ; but observes, that as
Jablonski had not proved, in opposition to Kircher, that it
was not really an egyptian word, he is willing to adopt it.
But surely this is a strange method of criticism. Is the fiat
of Kircher sufficient to establish a word as pure egyptian, for
which there is no other authority, at the very moment when
he is found guilty of a fraud ? At this rate, any lexicographer
who wished to fill up space, might insert as many words out
of his own head as suited his convenience, and when called
to account, has only to challenge his critics to show them to
be spurious. The onus probandi lay not on Jablonski, but
the Jesuit and his followers. The learned orientalist, however,
does not seem to insist on the genuineness of the word,q and

is too sound a critic not to be w,ell aware of its real inadmis
sibility, though he may carelessly have quoted it for the sake
of argument.
The name Sothis, according to Plutarch/ signified concep
tion or pregnancy, which, if the etymology were admitted, •would contain a very palpable allegorical allusion to its sup
posed influence on the inundation, big with the fertility and
prosperity of Egypt The value of his interpretation, how
ever, is destroyed by an attempt (not unusual with him in
such cases) to strain, by a silly pun, some analogy between
the egyptian sense of the term, and the idiom of his own lan
guage ; for xus/v, says he, in greek, means to conceive, as
fftoOi in egyptian ; hence the greek name «:W of the star. The
falsehood of this conceit, if not in other respects palpable, it
were easy to show by a reference to the most ancient of greek
fabulists, who thus describes the dog star :

Orion was a great hunter of the early greek tradition,
transferred by the fable at his death into a brilliant constella
tion ; and another very bright star in his neighbourhood was
naturally enough called his dog. Greek mythologists are
unanimous on this point. But the noxious influences ascribed
by the poet to the star still farther disprove any connexion,
not only between the two names, but between greek and
egyptian superstition in general, in as far as it is concerned.
For, on the banks of the Nile, its reappearance was hailed
as the attendant of the inundation, the most joyful and agree
able season of the year, and as the forerunner and guarantee
of divine favour and a productive harvest. Whereas the greek
poet describes it merely as " an evil omen announcing scorch
ing heat to wretched mortals :"

That Sothis signified dog-star or dog, or had any original
connexion with Thot, is still farther disproved by the terms
in which it is mentioned, as well by Plutarch himself in
various passages, as by a multitude of other classical illustra
tors of egyptian antiquity. " The Egyptians," says Damas
cus," " assert that Sothis is Isis, while the Greeks consider
this star as the same with Sirius, and Sirius is the same as
the Dog of Orion." Horapollo :Y " When they would denote
a year, they draw Isis, that is, the Hgure of a woman, by
which they also represent the goddess. But Isis is with them
a star, called by the Egyptians Sothis, but by the Greeks
Dog-star, which seems to reign over the other stars, and by
the rising of which they regulate the prognostications of their
calendar." Plutarch :w " The Egyptians consider the Dog
star as sacred to Isis." It were needless to accumulate quota
tions, but many other authorities might be adduced, whose
evidence corresponds with those above cited. From all this
it appears, first, that the star which the Greeks called Dog
star, was indeed the same which the Egyptians knew by the
name of Sothis, but there is no trace of this name itself de
noting a dog, or any thing of the kind. Secondly, That
Sothis was a representative of Isis, or at least consecrated to
that goddess, and not to Thot ; whose name, as far as I know,
is never mentioned in connexion with this star by any author
worthy of notice ; which would be unaccountable considering
the multitude there are who have treated minutely of both,
if the star were, I will not say dedicated to him, but actually
himself, the two names being synonymous. Thirdly, That
Sothis being Isis, or consecrated to Isis, was a female star ;
hence the name. also is with the Greeks, as might be expect
ed, feminine, n 'SuSi; ; whereas Thot is a male deity, and
the greek iereoxdcuv or x,jon ''ngiuio; is also masculine. It will

hardly be supposed that the Egyptians gave either their
deity Isis, or her favourite celestial orb, the name of she-dog.
On this point we have still a passage of Plutarch1 more ex
plicit than any hitherto quoted, and totally incompatible with
such a supposition. The Egyptians, he informs us, supposed
that the bodies of certain deities were preserved among them
selves upon earth, " while their souls were translated to heaven,
there to shine forth as so many stars. Thus the soul of Isis
is what the Greeks call Dog-star, but the Egyptians Sothis.''
That Sothis was sacred to Isis may farther be gathered from
the egyptian zodiacs, where this star or constellation is repre
sented as a heifer, one of the sacred emblems of that deity :
the identity is not to be questioned, as the figure occurs regu
larly in its place in the sign Cancer, accompanied by acces
saries whose signification cannot well be misunderstood. But
in no one of these astronomical monuments, or any others
.which I have seen, is there the appearance of a dog, or any
animal in the least resembling one, still less of Thot, or his
attributes or emblems, occupying a place in the portion of the
sign Cancer devoted to the constellation Sothis. Traces of
the egyptian character of the star we have also in the later
greek or roman mythology ; as in a gem given by De la
Chausse,y where we have a female bearing ears of corn in one
hand, and a plate of fruits or vegetables in the other, with the
legend CEI. for Si/jj/es, as justly interpreted by the ingcniou
author of the compilation.
All this seems to be confirmed by the following passage of
Salt's Essay on Phonetic Hieroglyphics,2 which, if the value
attached by him to his cyphers be admitted, would seem to
put the matter beyond controversy : " The phonetic name of
Sothis is very frequent, but it is generally found accompany
ing a figure of Isis ... it is composed of a star 2, the upper
half of a circle 0, and an egg 2."
The true etymology of the word Sothis is very doubtful.
That suggested by Plutarch is in itself not devoid of specious*

ness, and has been ingeniously enough referred to the Coptic
language by Jablonski,3 who, however, in support of some
favourite system, prefers another of a much less plausible
description. I should be disposed, from the positive way in
which Horapollo5 and others assert that the star was called
Isis, or the star of Isis, to consider it as the compound 2oT
©HSI, literally, the star Isis, or the star of Isis, contracted by
the Greeks into 2u6ig.c On the other hand, the pristine sig
nification of the name Thot or Thoout as written by the
Egyptians, appears very obvious, from a comparison of the
attributes of this god of science and all civil institutions, with
a Panth. lib. iii. c.2. § 10, pt. 2, p. 48.
b Lib. cit. § 10. p. 52.
c The variety 2n'0 of the name, which might appear at variance with
this derivation, rests on the sole testimony of Vettius Valens, an author
of little weight, frequently quoted from MS., but not yet published.
(Scalig. Can. Isag. p. 275. Ed. 1658. Marsh. Chron. Can. p. 9.) Plu
tarch, on the other hand, (de Is. c. 41. 49. 62.) asserts, that Seth, xiil,
was an egyptian name of Typhon, denoting violence, which is much
more probable ; the word is apparently the same primitiTe radical as the
arabic JsLi Sat, to burn up or destroy, (this being the peculiar occupation
of Typhon); whence the name of Satan, whose character in the orien
tal mythus answers to that of the egypiian dsemon, the fiery fiend, or
evil genius. Both are also occasionally personided as serpents. The greek Tvipuivt (the archaic form of the word) corresponds exactly in
name as in attribute; this appellation being of pure hellenic origin,
from tv<P«, tvtpH, signifying fiery or unwholesome vapours. The at
tempts to force an egyptian etymology upon it are worthy of no atten
tion.
The identity of these mysterious personages, as typical of the evil
principle in the common legend of the primseval human race, appears
farther, from their having each been held to have been precipitated by
the deity into the abyss. Concerning the true Satan, the prototype of
all, we need cite no pagan authority. Mahomet calls the arabian dsemon
Satan radjim *.*i». Satan stoned, lapidibus obrutus. (Kor. Sur. xv. 17.

see Herodotus (iii. 5.) Concerning the greek, Horn. II. fi. 782. Hesiod.
Theog. 821, sqq. Pind. 01. iv. 12. Pyth. i. 31.
As it is not very probable that Typhon, the evil genius, and Sothis,
the good genius, should be designated among the Egyptians by the same
name, the form Seth, as applied to the latter, cannot be admitted on such
indifferent authority.

the sense of the Coptic roots of similar sound and orthography.
©noxT in Coptic means an assembly, meeting, or council.11
On the monuments, the deity is frequently represented bear
ing in his hand the hieroglyphic symbole denoting Assembly,
Senate, taniyvyg, &c, as evidently exercising an influence over
their proceedings or periodical meetings ; and we have autho
rity to believe, that in a mysterious sense, assembly or Thoout,
the egyptian Mercury, and scientific invention or improvement,
of which he was patron, were nearly synonymous. " The
god Mercury," says Jamblichus/ in his work on the egyptian
mysteries, " was considered as the common genius of the
priesthood, since the patron deity of science is one and the
same in all. Hence the ancients dedicated the inventions of
their own wisdom to Mercury, inscribing all their treatises
with his name.'' " In Egypt," says Galen,g " it was neces
sary that every new discovery in the arts should be approved
of and sanctioned by the common council of the learned ; after
which it was inscribed, without the name of the author, on
the sacred columns, and deposited in the archives. Hence
so great a number of books ascribed to Mercury." Here then
Mercury, and the assembly of the learned, or college of priests,
as public and ostensible authors of all inventions, are one and
the same ; Thoout therefore was merely a figure of the inven
tive and intellectual faculties of humanity. Proclus relates
nearly the same thing of the Pythagoreans, whose school was
formed on the egyptian model : 5-1511 wiviavian iiotrdZono rqv h Tali

quoting these authorities, Jablonski observes:11 " Sponte

deity, to exercise his learning or his ingenuity in farfetched
and less pointed illustrations.
It is evident, then, that the opinion now under examina
tion, is far from being justified by any connexion between the
names of Thot and Sothis. Another cause of error has been
the notion, suggested by a superficial view of egyptian
superstition, that Thot was the same person as Anubis, the
dog-headed deity, which has gone much to confirm the
belief that he was the same as the dogstar. This opinion is
however also inconsistent with the pure egyptian doctrine.
The greek, or rather the latin authors of the lower ages of
classical antiquity, amid the confusion introduced by them
into the ancient mythology, by their attempts to identify the
gods of all the neighbouring nations with their own, were
no doubt in the habit of calling both Thot and Anubis,
and perhaps several other egyptian divinities, by the name of
Hermes or Mercury. But these two, in the original pan
theon, were distinct persons. The first was a deity of high
rank and dignified office, as above described ; and represented
with the head of an ibis, or sometimes by the bird itself. The
other was represented with the head of a dog, or rather, as
M. Champollion,' I conceive justly, observes, of a jackal,
mistaken by the Greeks for a household dog. His precise at
tributes are little known, but he seems to have been a very
subordinate divinity, a drudge (or lioris-provider as it were)
of Thot, in his capacity of secretary or chief minister of Osiris
and Isis. The distinction between the two is laid down indeed
accurately enough by several of the classics ; who inform us
that the sacred animals of the one were the ibis, and cynoce
phalus or egyptian ape; of the other, the dog or jackal."
The one was worshipped at Hermopolis, the sacred city of
the Cynocephalus ; the other at Cynopolis, the sacred city of
the Dog.1 Here accident opened a wide door to error ; the
ape called dogheaded by the Greeks being the emblem of the

one deity, the dog that of the other, naturally led to a confu
sion of the two ; and it is clear how obvious it was, for such
fanciful interpreters farther to confound both with their Dog
star ; which, after all, none of the more profound or discreet illustrators of egyptian tradition have done. Jablonski,m al
though for the sake of arrangement he calls both these deities
Mercury, in conformity with the old classical phraseology, has
yet judiciously classed them as quite distinct personages of
his pantheon.

Under the term western, I would be understood to include
certain oriental nations of modern times, whose zodiacs, from
their close resemblance to that of Egypt or Greece, cannot
but be considered as borrowed directly or indirectly, in the vi
cissitudes of the history of science, from one or other of those
countries. That such is the case with respect to the sphere
of the Arabs and Persians is generally admitted ; which
makes it the more surprising, that a person usually so well
informed on these subjects as De la Nauze11 should assert, that
" no connexion can be traced between the names of the signs
which we have adopted from the Greeks, and those by which
they are known among the Arabs, and other oriental nations,
who are supposed to have best preserved the remains of the
ancient egyptian sphere ;" a statement disproved in the most
distinct and positive manner, by almost every author, oriental
or european, who has treated of these matters." Sir William

dus, if not to the original invention, at least to the knowledge
and vise of the twelve signs, from the remotest periods of an
tiquity. But as the zodiac, which heq and other illustrators
of indian astronomy' have given us, is precisely the same as
that of the Greeks, it is impossible to suppose but that the one
is borrowed from the other ; and that the Greeks have bor
rowed from the Indians is hardly to be conceived. Sir Wil
liam appeals to the vast antiquity of indian science ; to the
contempt of the Hindus for every thing foreign ; and the scorn
and ridicule with which their sages treat the notion of their
having been indebted, directly or indirectiy, to the Javans or
Greeks, for any of theirinstitutions. Yet, after all, he sums up
with the conclusion,* that " the practice of observing the stars
began in Chaldasa, from whence it was propagated into Egypt,
India, Greece, &c. before the reign of Sisac or Sacya, who by
'conquest spread a new system of religion and philosophy from the Nile to the Ganges, about a thousand years b. c.n It is
not easy to reconcile ^this admission of a new system from
Egypt in the tenth century b. c. with the immense antiquity
of their astronomical science, and abhorrence of foreign inno
vation. If Sir William Jones could, consistently with his
system, believe the paradox, that the egyptian Sisac conquer
ed all Asia, and introduced a civil as well as a political revo
lution into India in the tenth century 'B. c, may we not be
permitted to suppose, that the zodiac was borrowed from the
Greeks, successors of Alexander, or the arab conquerors of the
middle ages ; and that Sir William's indian authorities who
assert the contrary, are as fallacious as those on whom he rests
his belief of the empire of Sisac.
Mr. Bentley, a writer of equal authority on these points,
has founded on the same evidence a very different opinion ;
treating very lightly both the antiquity of the astrono
my of the Indians, and the genuineness of their supposed
primeval records.1 " The most candid part of the Hindus,"'

says he, " acknowledge that literary forgeries are frequently
committed, in consequence of the depravity of the age we live
in, which can relish nothing but what is supposed to bear the
stamp of antiquity. Hence learned men are under the neces
sity of fathering their works on the sages of early times ;" and
he adds, that on account of the great ignorance and supersti
tion of the hindu reading public, " every species of literary
imposition may be committed without the smallest danger of
detection.'"
Captain Wilfort" informs us, after his Pundit, that the
constellations of Cassiopea, Cepheus, Perseus, and Androme
da, were also in the indian sphere. He, too, with the natural
partiality of an oriental antiquary, refers the origin of the
names of these asterisms, as well as of the fables attached to
them, to the tradition of the gymno-sophists. The impartial
mythologist will perhaps judge differently.
" The Hindus" says Mr. Colebroke,7 another acute and
laborious inquirer into the history of indian astrology, " have
adopted the division of the ecliptic into twelve signs or con
stellations, agreeing in figure and designation with those of
the Greeks.... That they took the hint of this mode of dividing
the ecliptic from the Greeks is not altogether improbable.''
And in another place, treating of the correspondence of the
Daresh' canas with the Decani of the egyptian, greek, and
roman astrologers ; after adopting the opinion of Huet the
commentator of Manilius, that the word Decanus was corruptly
formed by the astrologers of Alexandria, from the greek nu
meral d'sjca, he observes:" "The Sanscrit name apparently
comes from the same source. I do not suppose it to be originally
Sanscrit, since in that language it bears no etymological signi
fication. For the same reason it is likely that the astrological
doctrine itself may be exotic in India. One branch of astro
logy, entitled Tajaca, has been confessedly borrowed from the
Arabians ; and the technical terms used in it are, as I am in

though its practice is of more ancient date in India, may also
have been received from western astrologers ; Egyptians,
Chaldeans, or even Greeks.'' He also states, that one of their
highest authorities, " Varaha Mihira himself, as interpreted
by his commentator, quotes the Yavanas, (meaning perhaps
grecian authors) in. a manner which indicates that' the descrip
tion of the Dreshcanas is borrowed from them." One of these
was called Yavana charya—probably a greek philosopher of
the name of Chares. All this is sufficient answer to the re
marks of Sir William Jones on the contempt of the Bramas
for the science of western nations.1

That this was the true meaning of Eudoxus appears from
the peculiar tenor of the passage itself, fragment as it is, which
evidently bears reference to a comparison drawn by that philo
sopher, between the motions of the sun, and those of some
other heavenly body, whose retrograde course in the ecliptic
was much more remarkable ; and from the general context of
Hipparchus it would appear that that heavenly body was the
moon. The moon's nodes, or the points at which she crosses
the ecliptic in her orbit, have a retrograde motion of 19g de
grees every year ; so that they shift through all the signs and
degrees of the ecliptic in eighteen years, two hundred and
twenty-five days. It would appear then probable, that Eu..

orbit of the moon, adds ;y painrcu Si biapogav tuv xara reonug TOitm

other farther to the south ; that is, that its orbit was one year
more, another less inclined to the equator ; a sense which is
far from being implied in his own words. Eudoxus may have
expressed himself obscurely, as being really little familiar with
the true nature of the phenomenon ; and Hipparchus, who is
admitted to have been ignorant of it, at the time when he com
posed the treatise where this passage occurs, may have misun
derstood him ; but there is no reasonable ground to doubt,
that the words of the cnidian philosopher contain an allusion,
however vague, to the precession of equinoxes.

Bruce calls this stela " a Tot" (Thot) " or calendar;"'
both which appellations may be to a certain extent correct ;
as the human figure which it contains, from a comparison
with other monuments, I conjecture to be the god Lunus or
Moon, who, there seems little reason to doubt, is the deity of
the egyptian pantheon frequently represented with a similar horn, and standing upon two crocodiles ;J and a lunar reckon
ing being the primitive foundation of the egyptian, as of all
other calendars, the divinity of the moon might not improba
bly be fabled to exercise an influence over it. It would ap
pear also that the same luminary was not unfrequently person ified by the god Thot,a who was unquestionably the patron
deity of the calendar as of all other scientific institutions.
There can therefore be little doubt but that the physical sym
bols which this deity holds, or by which he is surrounded, are
connected with the zodiac. The orphic sage, the fragments
of whose works contain so many traces of egyptian mythology,

Jablonskic has analyzed the character and properties of this
goddess with much learning and acuteness, though some of
his conclusions may not perhaps be in strict harmony with
the pure spirit of egyptian mythology. His etymology is
certainly false : yet I incline to believe, that the influence
which he assigns Athor in the cosmogony, as primeval princi
ple of dusk or darkness, whence springs light and the sun,
according to the orphic tradition, is justified by the general
tenor of the testimony of both authorities and monuments.
M. Champollion, while advocating a different opinion, hag
here, as on other occasions, treated the views of this valuable
author with a degree of contemptuous severity, which was
neither necessary nor warranted by any new light hitherto
thrown on the properties of Athor by his own researches.
The internal evidence even of those monuments which he him
self has published and illustrated, appears to me very much to
confirm the views of Jablonski. The french critic in his Pan
theon11 describes a goddess as, " Bouto nourrice des dieux, em
bleme de Tantique nuit ou des tenebres primitives. On donnait
avec raison le surnom de mere des dieux a la deesse Bouto, puis
que unie aux dieu Phtha elle avait enfante Phre ou le soleil,
desquels naquirent ensuite tous les autres dieux." Compare this
with the following passage of his description of Athor :c " Phtha
etant le pere de tous les dieux, la deesse Hathor sa compagne
fidele, dut passer sinon pour leur mere, du moins pour leur
nourrice." It appears then quite clear according to this ac
count, that Athor and Bouto are merely different personifica

tions of the same primeval Night, spouse of Phtha ; which is
precisely the system of Jablonski.f In another place however,
M. Champollion in his ardour to confute his brother antiquary,
has I fear contradicted himself. " Jablonski," says he,g " en

At this rate Ammon (himself la nuit), being in common with
the sun and all the other gods, descended from Bouto (also la
nuit) or Athor, and Phtha, would be the principe inconnu of
his own grandfather and grandmother.

Jackson h however disagrees with Petavius, and is of opinion
that Geminus must have lived before Hipparchus, that is be
fore the year 160 b. c. in which that astronomer flourished ;
assigning as a reason, that neither the works of Hipparchus,
nor of any other equally recent author, are alluded to in the
treatise of Geminus. He has therefore been induced to place
that mathematician about 246 b. c. ; chiefly by a misinterpre
tation, as we shall see, of a passage of his work,' where mention
is made of Eudoxus ; as if we were there given to understand
that he himself, (Geminus) lived only a hundred and twenty
years after the philosopher of Cnidos. But that our chronolo

Geminus mentions Hipparchus no less than three times in one
chapter. Whence it would appear, that the learned critic had
not read the work he quotes with any care ; but has probably
been misled by Petavius,k who by a curious enough oversight,
although himself the editor of the Elementa of Geminus, has
fallen into the same error. Fabricius1 has also omitted the
name of Hipparchus in his list of the authors cited by Gemi
nus. This is a singular instance of three men of such pro
found research, following as it were the steps of each other in
so strange a blunder ; and shows the danger of admitting ap
peals to authority, without careful collation of the original
text. But even had Jackson been right in this respect, there
are other points of internal evidence contained in the work of
Geminus, amply sufficient to confute his views. In the first
place, Geminus quotes, not only Eratosthenes"1 who flourished
towards the end of the third century n. c. and Cratis" the ho
meric critic of the age of Philometor, which comes down as low
as 145 b. c, but Posidonius,0 who lived nearly about the same
period which we have assigned himself. Secondly, his style
and language prove him to be more recent than Hipparchus,
especially his constant use of the term Zyyoc, or libra, for yjika.!,
or the claws of the Scorpion, the ancient name of the seventh
sign of the zodiac among the Greeks, with whom the term
Zvyog came only recently into general use, being unknown to
Aratus, used once by Hipparchus, but supplanting Chela? al
most altogether with Geminus. Petaviusphas also remarked that
the calculation of the degrees of longitude on the ecliptic, and
not on the equinoctial, was familiar to this mathematician ;
whereas it was unknown or little practised before the days of
Hipparchus. Thirdly, the name Geminus being evidently
latin, though pronounced TifiTrng by the Greeks, implies a con
nexion with Rome, which could hardly be presumed in the

case of a rhodian philosopher of the period to which Jackson
would assign him, namely the first punic war.
Under all these circumstances, taken in connexion with his
statement concerning the Isia, the epoch assigned him by
Petavius appears unexceptionable. Zoegaq has run into the
opposite extreme from Jackson, and found so little proof of
antiquity in the Elementa, that he was inclined to have brought
their author down to a much lower period ; for reasons how
ever, which he does not state, and the soundness of which he
himself distrusted.
The following is the passage of Geminus above alluded to,
on which the conclusion of Jackson is grounded : binoZcXriv o!>x

loger has understood, as if Geminus had said, that " those
were in error/ who thought the Isia were celebrated at the
winter solstice in the days of Eudoxus ;" in which case the
literal interpretation of the latter part of the passage would be,
" that the winter solstice coincided with the Isia, in the days
of the Egyptians and of Eudoxus ;" which is evidently non
sense, unless we suppose the whole race of native Egyptians
extinct in Geminus' time. Petaviuss on the other hand under
stands it, " that they erred in supposing the celebration of the
Isia to be fixed to the winter solstice, as constituted accord
ing to the observations of the Egyptians and Eudoxus ,"
namely, towards the end of December ; which is both better
grammar, and plain sense ; Eudoxus having studied under the
theban priests, and being supposed to be indebted to them
for the improvements which he made in the calendar of his
countrymen.

sistent with his usual research or judgment. In spite however of his
general learning, this author's ideas on the subject of the egyptian calendar
were somewhat crude and undigested ; as appears not only from the weak
passage here referred to, but the whole tenor of his writings on egyp

Plutarch,'. after describing the four days of mourning, from
the seventeenth to the twentieth of Athyr inclusive, {r'uHfagag

adds : " but on the nineteenth at night, they go down towards
the sea, and the priests and ministers bring forth the sacred
chest, containing the gilded shrine, into which they pour fresh
water, and immediately a cry is raised by all present that Osi
ris is found ;" followed by other agreeable ceremonies. This
day, however, cannot be the nineteenth of Athyr, devoted, as
above stated, to lamentation. Accordingly, the commentators
are nearly unanimous, that there is some error 'either in the
text or the description, or that the name of the month has
fallen out. Kircher" supposes the day alluded to belonged to
the next month, Choiak ; with whom I have no hesitation in
agreeing ; referring it either to the nineteenth of that month,
or to the nineteenth day from the commencement of the cere
mony, which would be the fifth of Choiak. Jablonski,T who
also saw that there was an error, and agreed with Kircher
that it lay in the omission of the name of the month, would
rather supply Tybi ; and upon this basis has grounded his
attempt to illustrate the mysteries of the Isia. His whole
argument is however from the first fallacious, resting origi
nally on the fallacious hypothesis, that the festival was ap
pointed to a season of the fixed alexandrian year ; adopted
from too great a deference to the careless and superficial lan
guage of Plutarch, though contrary to the testimony of Era
tosthenes, Geminus, and the whole tenor of egyptian tradition.
Besides, it is evident from the joint testimony of the authors
quoted in our text, that these ceremonies, however varied,
were yet in a certain degree continuous, forming portions of
one mythological drama ; which would hardly be consistent

with the notion of their being extended over three months.
It would appear indeed, from the description of Apuleius
quoted in the text, that these solemnities, when adopted by
the Greeks, were completed in one day. It was not to be
expected that such lively imitators would, in transferring the
new rites to their own calendar, adhere very closely to all the
characteristic details of the original egyptian usage. This
very circumstance, however, tends still farther to shew the
correctness of the sense we have assigned to the text of Plu
tarch. It is probable that the going out to the sea with the
sacred chest or ark, as described by that author, is connected
with the ceremony, which the Greeks considered (whether
rightly or no may be doubtful) as the annual mission of a
messenger by water to Byblos in Phenicia, announcing the
proper season for celebrating the feast of the Adonia ; which
they held to be derived from the Isia or death of Osiris in
Egypt, and supposed could not be commeneed, until the rites
of its prototype were concluded.TM To this ceremony the pro
phet Isaiah has been supposed to allude in the passage : Woe
to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers
of Cush, that sendeth ambassadors to the sea, even in vessels
of bullrushes upon the waters, saying, go ye swift messengers, &c.x

From Porphyryf we learn, that Osiris was the husband,
brother, and son of Isis ; a remark which however proble
matical, is confirmed by the whole tenor of egyptian tradition.
He was in fact the male principle of nature, of which many of
his sons or subordinatagdivinities were merely portions or pro
perties personified. In the same way Isis, as the female prin
ciple, was also Neith, Bouto or Latona, Athor, &c. To treat
this subject at length would require a dissertation of itself.

I have however all along admitted as the basis of my endea
vours to illustrate egyptian mythology, the fundamental
principle formally laid down and recognised by the ancients,
that Isis and Osiris were respectively the female and male
essence of the godhead. This canon is first established by
Herodotus,8 (the earliest greek author who treats of the su
perstitions of this country and who visited it when the national
institutions still existed in their purity,) in the passage where
he tells us, that while the worship of the other deities was
chiefly confined to the city or nome under their peculiar pa
tronage, that of Isis and Osiris was common to the whole na
tion. It has continued through successive ages to be admitted
as unquestionable, and beyond the pale of controversy, and
has formed the groundwork of the most celebrated treatises
ancient or modern on the subject of egyptian mythology ; and
I have seen no solid reason for questioning its accuracy.
I have been led to this observation, from having perceived,
or fancied I perceived, a disposition in some quarters, to de
grade these two celebrated elements of ancient superstition,
into deities of inferior rank in the modern pantheon.
No. XVII—Page 113.
Mons. Champollionh has indeed asserted, that the moon
among the Egyptians was a male deity, and a male deity only.
This opinion however appears to me to rest on no authority
but his own ; being in express contradiction to the united
testimony of the ancients, who formally state that the luminary
entered in a feminine capacity into the character of several
female personages of the pantheon. Of this the disc between
bull's horns, worn by these female deities, was, as we learn
from Diodorus,' Orpheus,k and all the most respectable

authors, a natural and obvious symbol. And the french critic
has advanced no evidence calculated, in my opinion, to out
weigh their authority. The passages of Plutarch, Spartianus,
and Ammonius, which he quotes in favour of his own system,
and which I have consulted in the original, appear to me alto
gether adverse to it. As they distinctly admit the moon to
have been aeeivotlriXvf among the Egyptians.

The author of these remarks has occupied himself for hours
together, in observing the motions of these singular insects,
which are more or less common on all the sandy coasts of
the Mediterranean, at least on those of Sicily and Calabria.
He has not unfrequently seen two, apparently male and fe
male, engaged with one ball ; which would seem to confute at
once the fanciful opinion of the Greeks concerning the sex of
the species. Among other claims which they have to be con
sidered as typical of the god of day, is the constancy with
which they continue their course, and their boldness and per
severance in trundling their orb along, in spite of all obstacles
which may occur to hamper their retrograde movement ; as if
still farther to emulate, in one of his noblest attributes, the
unwearied sun, 'ttiXiov dxafrnvra. I have sometimes amused
myself with scraping a small trench in the sand across the
path of the traveller, into the bottom of which he and his
globe tumbled backwards together. He would then look round
for some part of the side of the abyss, so little precipitous, as
to permit of his rolling it out again ; and finding none, would
set to work, and scrape a gap sufficiently wide and smooth for
the purpose, and then turning round on his head again, grasp
his precious burden in his thighs, and resume his retrograde
journey. Once I deprived him of his ball altogether, and
having removed him to a position at some considerable dis
tance, where he could not observe my proceedings, buried it



APPENDIX. NO. XVIII. 243
to some depth in the sand. Immediately however on being
set free, he rushed back to the spot where he had been separat
ed from his bit of dang, and not finding it, began to hunt the
ground in the neighbourhood like a pointer ; until suddenly
stopping over the place where it was buried, he commenced
burrowing in the sand until he reached it, and whisking round
again upon his head rolled it off in triumph. It was impos
sible not to feel surprise, and at the same time admiration, at
the boldness, constancy, and skill, with which the little crea
ture maintained his own against a superior force, without the
slightest appearance of personal fear, or of any other feeling
but anxiety for the safety of his beloved orb ; nor certainly,
if egyptian piety admitted that the sun could, under any cir
cumstances, be appropriately represented by a nasty reptile,
could they have selected one, more worthy of his high sym
bolic office, than this beetle. The journey seemed to be long
and tiresome, as I never had either time or patience to see
where or how it ended. Such are the facts that have come
under my observation respecting the scarabee, to which neither
commentators nor travellers appear to have paid much attention.
Even those who quote the well-known passages of Clemens
Alexandrinus and others, seem seldom to have understood their
import. Thv di "HXiov, says that learned father, r$ roZ KavDugou,

they likened to a scarabee, because this insect makes a round
ball of beasts dung, and rolls it circularly with his face op
posed to that luminary." What he means by " rolling it cir
cularly" it is difficult to understand. A round ball, if rolled
at all, must, in a certain sense, no doubt be rolled circularly ;
but if his meaning be, that the scarabee and his ball describe
a circle in their retrograde course, that is neither true in itself
nor the sense contained in the text of Clemens. The word
bmnrfouvros he has also misunderstood ; as it refers to the posi
tion of the face of the animal, not with respect to the sun, but
to the ball of dung, or to his own course.

244 APPENDIX. NO. XVIII.
The following description of this species of scarabee is ex
tracted from the Encyclopedia britannica,TM which the reader
may compare with what I have given above from personal ob
servation. "The Scarabaeus carnifex, which the Americans
call the tumble-dung, particularly demands our attention. It
is all over of a dusky black, rounder than those animals are
generally found to be, and so strong, though not much larger
than the common black beetle, that if one of them be put
under a brass candlestick, it will cause it to move backwards
and forwards, as if it were by an invisible hand, to the admira
tion of those who are not accustomed to the sight. But this
strength is given it for much more useful purposes than those
of exciting human curiosity ; for there is no creature more
laborious, either in seeking subsistence, or providing a proper
retreat for its young. They are endowed with sagacity to dis
cover subsistence by their excellent smelling, which directs
them in flights to excrements just fallen from man or beasts,
on which they instantly drop, and fall unanimously to work
in forming round balls or pellets thereof, in the middle of
which they lay an egg. These pellets, in September, they
convey three feet deep in the earth, where they lie till the
approach of spring ; when the eggs are hatched, and burst
their nests, and the insects find their way out of the earth.
They assist each other with indefatigable industry, in rolling
these globular pellets to the place where they are to be buried.
This they are to perform with the tail foremost, by raising up
their hinder part, and shoving along the ball with their hind
feet.

the sphere of the Phenicians, Arabs, and other oriental na
tions. An old name of the constellation Virgo among these was Spica, in the Semitic tongues Shibbula,n Shibboleth,
nbiaiy, Nbiaw, *X*JUv, from the ear of corn she held in her
hand, a part being taken for the whole, as in the modern
cyphers of this and other signs of the zodiac. Virgo is still
commonly represented on the arabic sphere by the ear of corn
alone. Among many ancient nations, both hellene and bar
barous, the gift of prophetic inspiration, though common to
both sexes, seems yet to have been considered, more than any
other divine attribute, as peculiarly conferred upon females.
Most of the greek oracles were served by women ; and of
prophetesses by profession in the east we have, among other
examples, that of the witch of Endor. As divination in all
ages of the world was connected with observation of the stars,
it was natural enough that the celestial maid, or shibbula,
should become the emblem or type of the science. Hence,
as Hyde observes :° " Among the chaldee and phenician
mystics, was feigned a certain supernatural virgin, by name
Sibylla, or as Tacitus has it, Sibulla, which name became
common to every female who had pretensions to enthusiastic
inspiration or prophetic fire." A mysteriorum cusoribus,
Chaldaeis et Phcenicibus, prsetendebatur miraculosa quaedam
virgo, nomine Sibylla, seu, ut Tacitus, Sibulla ; unde factum
est ut quaevis enthusiastica foemina et extatico furore acta
vaticinatrix, eodem nomine vocaretur. This same supersti
tion we find transferred from east to west, under the mys
terious character of Sibylla ; a name certainly not of greek or
latin origin, and of which there can be no doubt but the above
is the true etymology. As proof of this it may be remarked,
that several of the most celebrated of these Sibyls are referred
to Asia, as Sibylla persica, babylonia, erythraea.p The attempt
to give the word a greek etymology : " ut sit efcuXka, quasi

Jackson, however, it must be observed, errs grossly in sup
posing, that not only the heliacal rising of Sirius, but the
summer solstice of the year 1322, fell on the 22d of July of
the Julian calendar ; whereas this last really fell on the sixth
of that month ; and the error has been transferred to his
calculation of *he epoch at which the coincidence is made to take place between the Thot and the equinox. Dr. Hales,r
in adopting and repeating his mistake, quotes Petavius, who,
he observes, made the 20th of July 1322 the day of the
summer solstice ; but Petavius was never guilty of such an
oversight. I find a very different statement in his Var.
Dissert. ii. 4. Jackson8 is farther of opinion, that the egyp
tian names of the months were not invented until after the
Exodus, because Moses did not adopt them as his country
man did those of the Chaldees after the babylonish captivity.
A previous remark of his own might have furnished him with
a better solution of this difficulty, namely, that the months of
the Egyptians were called after their gods. Was it likely
that Moses would have dedicated the seasons of his sacred
year to Thot, Athyr, Amnion, the abominations of the
Egyptians ?

Iliad, which even the most curious of the ancients could not
make out to be any thing more than a poetical hyperbole ;'
or to prove by the authority of the Odyssey, that lower Egypt,
which existed in the days of Moses, was a bay of the sea in
those of Menelaus ; still, the poet's own descriptions of this
country, when fairly examined, bear in themselves the strong
est internal evidence, that he had no personal acquaintance
with its interior, and that what little he knew of it was derived
from hearsay, or possibly from a piratical expedition to its
coast, similar to those described by himself, and by Herodotus,
as usual among their countrymen in early ages." Sir I. New
ton1' assumed that the pyramids were not built in Homer's
time, because the bard, having been in Egypt, does not men
tion them ; and the conclusion is just, as referred to the pre
mises ; since a poetical imagination could hardly fail to be
smitten with those prodigious monuments ; and a poet, so
minute in his description of localities as Homer, were still less
likely to have passed them over unnoticed, in treating of the
wonders of the banks of the Nile. But were it not more
reasonable to infer, that he does not mention them because he
had never seen them ? Others go the length of asserting,
that Homer knew the true cause of the inundation, which re
mained a mystery to the most curious of his countrymen for
many centuries after his day, because he applies the epithet of
biivirfji to the Nile. A//Vet^, it is said, means falling or pro
ceeding from Jove, that is, figuratively, swoln by rains, A/os
opfyy but the inundation was owing to the rains of Ethiopia,
therefore Homer knew its cause. These critics have over
looked the circumstance, that di/cirrn is a familiar epithet with
the poet for any river, when it happens to suit his metre ; those
of his own country being little more than mountain torrents,
full in winter, but nearly dry in summer, unless when swoln
by showers, on which occasions they frequently overflowed their
banks, and committed great ravages; and these visitations

being ascribed by the superstitious inhabitants of their valleys
to the anger of the deity," the expression 8/>'«r«, both in a
moral and physical sense is highly appropriate. It occurs
seven times ; twice applied to the Nile," twice to the Scaman
der,y once to the Sperchaeus,2 once to a river of the island of
Scheria," and once in a mere poetical simile to a river in gene ral ;b to suppose then that it contains any mysterious or special
allusion in the case of the Nile, is altogether gratuitous. The
more, as the supposed allusion itself would have been unin
telligible to his countrymen, to whom his descriptions of that
river were addressed, and who could merely have inferred from
it, that the Nile was such a torrent as the Scamander or the
Sperchaeus. Might we not then more fairly argue, from the
very fact of the poet's applying this ordinary and common
place epithet to the Nile, that he was really ignorant of the
little resemblance which existed between that great stream, and
the mountain torrents of his own country ; and consequently,
of the general peculiarities for which the climate of Egypt was
celebrated in the vulgar tradition of both Egyptians and
Greeks ; namely, that rain never fell on its soil, unless as a
prodigy, and that the river, instead of being replenished accord
ing to the ordinary course of nature, was made to overflow its
banks by mysterious and supernatural means. Had Homer,
like Hecataeus or Herodotus, ever really travelled in Egypt,
these are the wonders for which he would probably, like them,
have celebrated that country on his return home.
Antiquaries are surely very inconsistent, who in one place
tell us, what is most true, that the Egyptians in early times
hated navigation or foreign travel, and were jealous of admit
ting strangers, especially uncircumcised barbarians like the
Greeks, to the interior of their country ; and in another, de
scribe the same Egyptians as establishing maritime colonies
over the whole coast of the aegaean sea, and the same european
barbarians as sailing up and down the Nile 1 200 years, b. c,

The best version of the tradition concerning the colonists,
Danaus, &c. is that given by Diodorus ;c who makes them
arab or phenician occupants of lower Egypt, driven out by
the aboriginal natives to seek refuge, partly in Palestine,
partly on the coasts of Hellas ; an account both probable in
itself, and highly consistent with the general tenor of the
history of all tljree nations. The antiquities of the heroic age
of Greece are replete with traces of the influence of phenician
commerce and settlement ; while between the language and
primitive manners of its inhabitants, and those of the Egyp
tians, little else than fanciful analogies can be traced, and such

It has been said, that the mere circumstance of certain con
stellations not having been mentioned by Homer, is not suffi
cient proof that he was ignorant of them. The remark though
reasonable enough as referred to the old sophistical dogma,
that nothing which the poet has not noticed could be known
to him, can yet hardly apply here ; considering his compre
hensive language in various passages, and the opportunities
he had of adding to his catalogue. He himself however
affords positive as well as negative proof, how very limited the
number of constellations was in his age and country. As he
describes the great bear as the only one of the sphere that
never set :

I allude here to the Theogony and Works and days alone,
to which may, in as far as the present subject is concerned,
be added the Shield of Hercules ; all these poems, whether
by the same author or no, being unquestionably of considera
ble antiquity. As for the Poetical Astronomy, which, with
a multitude of other works now lost, by obscure or doubtful
authors, was vulgarly attributed to Hesiod, there is no reason,
from the internal evidence of the fragments, to suppose it of
much earlier date than the days of Pindar or iEschylus. For
instance, we find Hesiod quoted as mentioning the fall of
Phaeton into the Eridanus or Po, and his adventures with a
a king of Liguria called Cycnus, which are clearly recent
fables of greco-italian or etruscan character, and no way con
nected with heroic greek mythology.11

The history of the constellations Orion and Scorpio afford
apposite illustration of the changes made by the introduction
of the signs of the zodiac on the primitive mythology of
Greece. The former, as already observed, was a hero cele
brated for his beauty and love of the chace ; who having, in
consequence of an amour with the rosy fingered Aurora,
incurred the displeasure of the deities, and, among others, of
the chaste Diana, was slain by the arrows of the virgin god
dess in her own island of Ortygia.

This may allude to the sudden death, or mysterious disappear
ance of the hero ; since an important office of the twin archer
deities, in the primitive greek mythology, was that of angels
or ministers of fate ; sudden death, without disease or apparent
cause, being assigned to their influence, or to their arrows,
as might be shown by a multitude of passages of Homer.
Probably Orion was in the habit of going forth to the chace
at daybreak, and having one fatal morning disappeared, and
never more been heard of, it might be fabled, that in conse
quence of his love for Aurora, he had been slain by the arrows
danum fluvium, qui et Padus dicitur, cecidisse, &c. This the real Hesiod
contradicts in the following verses :

Such are all the adventures of this hero mentioned by Hesiod. As he
is here made son of Ccphalus and Aurora, and not of Sol and Clymene,
it is clear that Ovid's whole fable of his fatal accident in the chariot of
his father was unknown to the author of the Theogony.

of Artemis. The homeric tradition is followed by Apollodorus'
and Horace.k But, in the later mythology of the orphic
hymns, Eratosthenes, and others,1 who appear to quote one of
these Pseudo-hesiods, (whose accounts must have been very contradictory, as Diodorus,m on similar authority, tells quite a
different story), we find that Orion having been guilty in the
island of Crete, Chios, or any other which suited the fancy of
the fabulist, of an attempt to ravish Diana, or of some such
impiety, Terra enraged sent forth a scorpion from her bosom,
which stung him on the heel ; and the wound having caused
his death, both the hero and his executioner were transferred
by Jupiter to the skies. Aratusn and others assure us that
the mysterious signification of all this was, that Orion sets
when Scorpio rises, hence the death of the one was attributed
to the birth of the other ; which is very likely ; but the sting
of a scorpion is a very different thing from the gentle darts
of Homer's Diana, and the new version of the fable is as
lame and unmeaning as the old heroic tradition is simple,
elegant, and poetical.
The question, where or what this island of Ortygia may
have been, where Diana slew Orion, is very obscure ; and has
been treated in a very unsatisfactory manner by the commen
tators. The name is much celebrated in the early mytholo
gy, although it does not appear to have been the ordinary
appellation of any island of the greek seas in historical ages.
Homer mentions it in one other place, as situated in the
.ZEgean not far from Syros :°

These verses prove at least that Homer's Oftygia was one of
the Cyclades. Later mythologists, from its being connected
by the poet with the twin deities, have supposed it to be the
same as Delos, which opinion has been adopted by the greater
number of modern commentators ; but that they are in error
appears, as well from Homer himself, who distinguishes De
los elsewhere by its proper name, as from the two next most
ancient testimonies concerning both islands ; that of the au
thor of the hymn to Apollo ascribed to Homer, in the follow
ing passage :p

Here we have the express distinction, that Apollo was born in
Delos, Artemis in Ortygia ; Delos then and Ortygia cannot be
the same ; but the two localities, being so closely connected
as the birth-places of twin deities, cannot be far distant. This
suggests the probability, that the Ortygia of Homer and of
the ancient poets, being evidently one of the Cyclades, may
have been Rhensea, an island situated so close to Delos, as to
be in fact the twin isle of that celebrated sanctuary of Apollo,
to whom, as to his sister Diana, it was, with its more celebrat
ed neighbour, jointly consecrated. Hence both are called now-a-days, by the modern greeks, Dili, or the two Delos ;r
being separated by a channel of scarcely half a mile in
breadth, and in ancient times connected by a bridge. In
fact, Strabo, the oldest and most authentic writer who identi

fies Ortygia as one of the Cyclades, and who had made the
poems of Homer his peculiar study, expressly informs us that
Rhenaea was anciently called Ortygia. The following is the description of the island given by him :s 'Prima, S1 igtifwv nrfihw

naea is a desert island, about four stadia from Delos, where
are the delian cemeteries ; since in Delos itself it is not per
mitted to bury, or to burn a corpse, nor so much as to keep a
dog ; but it was formerly called also Ortygia." This text has
been misunderstood by the commentators, who under the in
fluence of the old prejudice that Delos and Ortygia were the
same, have supposed the latter part of the passage to relate to
the first of these islands. But those who consider it impar
tially will see, that the geographer, having finished his des
cription of Delos, had proceeded in his circuit of the Cyclades
to the neighbouring island of Rhenasa, and that to Rhenaea
alone can the words dim/w^iro h\ xal 'Ogruyia irgortgov apply ; the
mention of Delos having been introduced only incidentally,
to account for the circumstance of its burying ground being
in Rhenasa. Add to this that Pliny asserts Rhenaea to have
been anciently named Artemitis, or the island of Diana, and
no doubt can remain that this is really the original Ortygia of
Homer, and of the goddess, where she slew Orion. The only
modern author who seems to have had a suspicion of this,
among many who have devoted pages to the illustration of
this obscure name, is the learned and accurate Tournefort ;'
who, after stating that both islands were called Delos by the
modern Greeks, adds : " Les cailles avaient fait donner le
nom d'Ortygia aux deux Delos.''
In later times this name seems to have been common to se
veral sanctuaries of Diana, as to a grove near her temple of Ephesus," and to the famous Syracusan citadelv sacred to

that goddess, where the ruins of her temple still exist. To
these the title was doubtless transferred by the greek colon
ists, from her more ancient rifLiw among the Cyclades ; and
the superior celebrity of these new Ortygias in after ages,
may have been among the causes, why so little tftkce of the
appellation as applied to the twin islet of Delos remained.
Delos seems afterwards to have engrossed the worship of
both Apollo and Diana to itself, as well as the honours and
emoluments accruing from their patronage ; while Rhenaea
was degraded to be the cemetery of its more holy neighbour,
whose soil it was not permitted to pollute with the corruption
of a dead body. Rhenaea, however, though called by Strabo
egrifio vtim'diov, probably from its being completely occupied as a
burying ground before his time, is yet much the best island of
the two, and many times larger than its neighbour.TM The
name Ortygia was no doubt applied to it from the number of
quails that frequented it. Rhenaea may be from 'Prjv, cattle ;
hence 'Prima, the island of pasturing, from the nature of its
soil, as opposed to that of Delos, which was in spite of its
sanctity but a dreary rock. Accordingly, Tournefort states,
that in his time the inhabitants of the neighbouring isles used
Rhenaea as a sheepwalk, while Delos was quite barren and
deserted.
But to return from this digression. That the fundamental
claims of the hero Orion to distinction, in the primitive greek
mythology, were, as we have hitherto assumed, partly his
surpassing beauty of person, which even attracted the love of
Aurora, but chiefly his skill in the chace and fondness for
that diversion, appears from the testimony of Homer, which
in these matters must be admitted as superior to all others ;
and who describes him as alone among the heroes in the realms
of Pluto, engaged in his favourite occupation ; pursuing, even
on the asphodel meadow of that dreary land, the s/'foXa of
the same wild animals, which he himself had slain on the
mountains of the upper earth :
whence, it is not very probable, that the name Ortygia was also known
to him as an appellation of Delos itself.

a remarkable passage in several respects, and proving, at
least, how vitally and essentially the character of Orion in the
ancient mythology was that of Hunter. Hence the bright
star Sirius, which rises immediately behind his own constel
lation in the heavens, was considered as his dog, following at
his heels. And with respect to his personal advantages, the
poet, speaking of the twin giants Otus and Ephialtes, says :
Kal iroX.j xaXhierous (ura yt xXvrk 'ng/wra.y
Such is the description of Homer ; and, taken in connexion
with the account of his death in the island, and by the hand
of Diana, is consistent and characteristic. Ideler,2 however,
who would have the appellation Dogstar to be of egyptian
origin, assumes in conformity with that opinion, that the cha
racter of Orion, while on earth, was that of a mere warlike
adventurer, remarkable for strength, violence and ferocity, (a
capacity in which, strictly speaking, he does not appear even
in the later mythology) ; and that his celebrity as a hunter
was altogether adventitious, derived from the neighbourhood
of the constellation which bore his name to the egyptian Dog
star. Of this interpretation, all that can be said is, that being
contrary to reasonable analogy, and the most ancient authori
ties, it is as inadmissible as we have already shewn the basis
to be on which it rests, namely, the supposed signification dog
of the egyptian word Sothis.

As for the invention of the zodiac by the centaur Chiron,
of which Sir Isaac Newton (followed by Whiston and others)
speaks with as much confidence, as we can do of his own dis
covery of the true system of the world ; great as is the weight
of his name, it may safely be classed among those paradoxes,
which will hardly be seriously maintained by either astrono
mer or antiquary of the present day. The whole hypothesis
rests on the evidence of an obscure and nameless poet, who,
as quoted by Clemens Alexandrinus,1 states, that Chiron de
lineated e'xfiij.aro, 'oXvfvxou ; whence our great mathematician
concludes,15 that the centaur was a practical astronomer, 'and
constructed a sphere for the use of the Argonauts in their
voyage. Sj^ara 'OXiWoli have however very little to do with
the daidvMrriiiSgia of the ecliptic ; Homer and Hesiod also
speak familiarly of certain constellations and their forms, but
that they were totally ignorant of the signs of the zodiac is
perfectly clear. But even admitting that this expression ne
cessarily referred to the constellations of the zodiac, what
faith is due to so vague and unauthentic a fragment ? Pre
cisely the same astronomical discoveries, which Sir Isaac's
author ascribes to Chiron, are attributed by Sophocles to Palamedes, by Euripides to Atreus, &c. ;c each fabulist select
ing as the author of popular inventions, such of the early na

wisdom or ingenuity ; but are we hence to conclude that these
were all practical astronomers and constructors of spheres ? Achilles Tatius,d after recapitulating the various contradic

notice, as well on account of its great beauty and simplicity,
as because it contains, in a few words, nearly the sum total
of the astronomical science, which can reasonably be attributed
to the sages of barbarous antiquity. " Nor need it be matter
of wonder, that the human mind should by nature be strongly
bent on this species of contemplation ; for as every soul,
being immortal, came down originally from heaven, looking
up wistfully to the skies, it beholds nought but kindred and
congenial objects, and feels attracted toward that place, whi

Freret, in his elaborate dissertation6 on the rustic calendars
of the ancients, has no doubt shown, in a satisfactory manner,
that there was a vast deal of prejudice and bigotry among the
lower orders of both Greece and Italy, as of all other parts of
the world, in all ages ; and that the constructors of almanacks
for vulgar use, as well as the popular writers on agriculture,
were not unfrequently under the influence of these prejudices
themselves, or willing to humour them in others ; but, that
the most celebrated astronomers of Greece, in those great works
on which their future fame was to rest, permitted their calcu
lations to be influenced by such motives, he has altogether
failed to show, as, with regard to Meton, he himself seems to

have admitted. It must be acknowledged, however, that he
has carried his system to an extravagant extent. Many of his
illustrations are derived from confused accounts of the obser
vations of old astronomers, of various ages and countries, con
tained in occasional passages of careless or ignorant authors,
or in certain fragments, some of them ascertained to be spu
rious, and most of them of very questionable authenticity ; and
in each of these statements the slightest variation which he de
tects from what ought to be the exact reckoning for the age of
the author with whose name the observation is connected, he
accounts for at once, by assuming the observation itself to have
been derived from some ancient rustic calendar, constructed for
the true period to which it ought to relate, as the age of Chi
ron, Hesiod, Thales, or others as it happens; all these calendars
of the barbarous ages being supposed to be correct to a year,
while those of the first philosophers of civilized Greece are as
sumed to be wrong. It is asserted by modern experimental as
tronomers, and, indeed, must be self-evident, that the precise
period of the heliacal rising of a star, owing to the vicissitudes
of climate, or the refraction of the atmosphere, can seldom be
ascertained exactly to a few degrees ; and yet a discrepancy of
a few days between two recorded statements of this nature is
sufficient, with the french academician, to establish an inter
val of several centuries between the epochs of the construction
of the imaginary rustic calendars, whence they are supposed
respectively to be derived. In the adjustment of his system,
he takes in a range of climate from the tropic to the Danube ;
he flies from Syene to Thebes, from Thebes to Alexandria,
from Egypt to Greece, Italy, Thrace, Scythia, in quest of
these calendars and their authors. All this sounds very learn
ed and ingenious, and has passed current with many persons
of both learning and ingenuity, and exercised a very consi
derable influence on chronological criticism ; but to those who
take the trouble carefully to analyze the proofs, it will also
appear very fallacious and inconsistent. Were it not more
reasonable to account for many of these discrepancies and
self-contradictions by real errors in the observations,—by the
oversights of quoters, who have misunderstood the sense of



260 APPENDIX. NO. XXV.
their authors,—or by the carelessness of transcribers and copy
ists, than to accuse the first men of science of antiquity of such
puerile inconsistencies ? In one instancef he has created an
egyptian calendar for the fifteenth century b. c. out of a state
ment contained in a latin fragment, which has passed under
the name of a translation from Ptolemy, but was admitted by
its editor, Petavius,8 and has been still farther shown by suc
ceeding critics to be sadly corrupt, if not altogether spurious.11
Ideler' has pointed out the fallacy, but cites Bailly as its au
thor, who hask, however, in this instance, as in several others,
merely copied Freret. As he was not, apparently, much of a
scholar himself, many of those illustrations contained in his
history of ancient astronomy, which involve to a certain ex
tent classical criticism, are borrowed from the works of the
learned secretary of the Academy of Inscriptions, a great part
of whose argument rests on the authority of this very frag
ment, where he has mistaken for observations made at widely
remote periods, certain varieties of data, which, in as far as
they are intelligible at all, really refer to different climates.
Once or twice, however, he has found observations attributed
to greek philosophers which would be inexact as to the latitude
of Greece for a period of not less than five hundred years after
the age in which they flourished ; as where Euctemon places
the rising of Sirius thirty-two days after the solstice.1 Ought
we not, on Freret's own principle, to conclude, that Euctemon
followed a calendar constructed as many centuries after he
was in his grave ? The difficulty he escapes at once, by sup
posing the observation to relate to the latitude of Scythia ; les
pays septentrionaux du pont Euxin, ou les Grecs avaient alors
un grand commerce. In another place,TM Eudoxus makes the
Pleiads set fifteen days after their true time for his own lati
tude. Here, again, Freret makes the observation refer to the

method to reconcile other discrepancies in the statements of

simple way by supposing observations made in the various
countries in which he studied, from southern Egypt to the
Hellespont, instead of an appeal to the spheres of Chiron or
of Hesiod ? But then, as Delambre says, On n'aurait pu ba
