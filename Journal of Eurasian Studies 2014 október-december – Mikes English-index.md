DEAR READER,
MO YAN IN CONTEXT
The Nobel Prize in Literature has in most cases a very beneficial effect: it brings to the fore authors who otherwise would remain in obscurity. This is especially the case with Mo Yan, the Chinese writer who received the Prize in 2012. Although he enjoyed a great reputation in China and Chinese speaking countries, his global recognition was limited to aficiados. Thanks to the Prize and the work of his translators, first and foremost his English language translator Howard Goldblatt, his œuvre reached millions of literature loving people all around the globe. If there is a writer who deserved this Prize, is definitely Mo Yan. Since 2012 I collected and read all of his novels (the latest one Frog just published in English translation in November this year) and short stories translated into English and I must confess he became my number one author.
Just recently (in September this year) a collection of essays about his œuvre, his personality and the controversies around his political stance and ideas has been published by the Purdue University Press, edited by Angelica Duran and Yuhan Huang, titled Mo Yan in Context — Nobel Laureate and Global Storyteller. The editors of this book did an outstanding job; they collected and glued together a number of essays on Mo Yan that is and in my view will remain a landmark in the English language world of literary criticism on this author for years to come. The many essays deal with his roots, his sources, the controversies that arose especially in the Western media plus a critical assessment of censorship, his many topics, etc. Equally refreshing was the comparison of his work with that of William Faulkner ́s If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem, Fumiko Hayashi ́s novels and Yan Lianke ́s Dream of Ding Village. All these essays together provide the reader with a deeper understanding and appreciation of Mo Yan ́s work and ethical stance.
Next to the inherent value of the book is its readability. It is a great pleasure to read it, from cover to cover. I have read a large number of collection of essays in many fields but this volume stands out as one of the very few that is highly enjoyable. I could simply not put it down for a moment! Such a volume does of course not eliminate the need to read the works of the author but it clarifies the context of his literary creation process. It also further stimulates the reading of all of his works. Having already done that myself I can only encourage all of you to do the same. I am almost certain that you will not regret it!

Symmetry and Topology of Decorative Ornaments on a Silver Jug of
the Seuso-Treasures
Abstract
Decorative ornaments of the jug from the Seuso-Treasures exhibits examples of ethnomathematics of the Late Roman Ages in Pannonia.
Introduction
The Seuso-Treasures is originating from Kőszárhegy village, Transdanubia Region, Hungary, created in the Late Roman Ages. The treasury consists of several silver vessels (dishes, jugs, pots, bowls) once probably deposited in the villa of a noble Roman aristocrat, living in a Roman Age settlement in the vicinity of the recent Szabadbattyán, Transdanubia, Hungary. This collection exhibits beautiful ornamental and figural adornments on the vessels and ornamental geometry may prove the rich set of ethnomathematical knowledge of the craftsmen of that age.
Fig. 1. Detailed outstretched drawing of a section of the surface of ornamental adornations on the famous jug of the Souso-Treasures which we call jug of ethnomathematics in Pannonia during the Roman ages. Symmetry of the background woven tendril ssystem on the jug is p4, however, in the cells p4g and p4m patterns were also placed. Various knots are also visible.

In the book of Éva Hajdú: A Seuso-kincs (The Seuso Treasury) there are excellent photographs of the vessels on which the geometry of ornamentation can be studied. There is a jug on page 18, which is covered by geometric figures placed in a woven p4 structure, which forms a framework and cell system (Fig. 1.) In the cells formed by the woven tendrills there are several simple but interesting knot types and several plane symmetry patterns.
In my earlier books, Symmetry and Structure Building (1990) and Eurasian Ethnomathematics (2011), chapters are devoted to the plane symmetry patterns and simple ornamental knots. Here we use them as background knowledge for the analysis of the patterns and knot in Roman Age Pannonian ethnomathematics.
Analysis of the plane symmetry patterns
There are 3 different types of plane symmetry patterns on the surface studied. Both of them have rotational symmetry points with 4 fold rotations but the mirror symmetry is gradually appearing in the three cases.
p4 is the symmetry of the woven frame (Fig. 2.).
Fig. 2. Structure of the woven frame on the Seuso ornamental jug. Symmetry of the pattern can be shown by the skeletal pattern built from triangles. This plane symmetry pattern has no mirror symmetry at all.

The classical weaving technology produces the textile pattern with p4g plane symmetry type (Fig. 3.). Substituting the sections of the visible thread with S (instead of I), we can receive a plane symmetry pattern without mirror symmetry: a p4 type one (Fig. 2. and Fig. 4.). So the relation of the tendril frame pattern on the jug (Fig. 2.) can be deduced from a simple woven textile pattern (Fig. 3.) by reducing its symmetry, by violating its mirror symmetry.
Fig. 4. Structure of the woven frame of the Seuso ornamental jug: p4, and the way it can be transformed from p4g woven structure by the superposition of S pattern on the visible threads, therefore p4g has mirror symmetry lines (Fig. 3.), but p4 has no such lines, only rotational centers (Fig. 4.).
Fig. 5. On the Seuso ornamental jug p4m patterns have the highest symmetry. The figure on left can be found in the upper row on the jug. The skeleton of this pattern is the most „crowded” by symmetry elements, because it has mirror axes not only at 90 degrees rotations, but at 45 degrees rotations, too.
As a summary the unknown goldsmith master was a craftsman with a sophisticated knowledge about the plane symmetry patterns with 4-fold rotations. All the 3 different types of plane symmetry patterns which contain 4-hold rotations are represented on the surface of the Seuso jug we are studying.

Analysis of the knots
Of the 12 fields represented in Fig. 1. (and the table about the positions) there are 9 spaces filled with knots or knot-like objects. All of them contain fourfold rotational symmetry. However, most of them are variants of simple knots. Simple knots can be characterized by the number of threads which weave the knot and the number of the rotational symmetry steps. For simple knots the number of threads is defined by a method: how much threads are cut (crossed) by the radius vector starting from the centre of the knot. (The centre of the knot is the center of a circle surrounding the knot).
Fig. 6. The systematics of the simple knots according to their rotational symmetry (rows) and the number of threads cut by the radius vector (columns) of the knot. (page 12, Bérczi, 2011)
Fig. 6. shows the beginning of a table of systematic representatiuon of the simple knots. The number of rotational symmetries may increase with the number of threads crossed by the radius vector. In the case of simple knots all the threads surrounding the center are equivalents. The number of „returns” may result in going to pieces of the thread, because while we rotate around the center we follow a universal rule of up and down tunnel in weaving the knots. All knotted lots are represented by their straightened version, too.

Fig. 7. The systematics of the simple knots according to their rotational symmetry (rows) and the number of threads cut by the radius vector (columns) of the knot. (page 11, Bérczi, 2011). Here the knots are straightened (left part) and some of them are divided to threads, too.

Fig. 8. The simple knots of the Seuso ornamental jug. All of them have C4 rotational symmetry, but one, the knot second from left has C8 rotational symmetry. The 3 knots from left have 2 threads woven one above the other, while the knot on he right edge has 3 threads. Topologically the two knots in the middle are equivalents.
Of the knots of Fig. 8. the one at the right edge is worth for analysis. In this knot the weaving results in breaking the knot into 3 subrings, which has no equivalent role in the knot. It will be shown, when we transform it from the rotational representation into the straightened one by circulating around the structure with the radius vector.

The equivalent topology of the three knots of Fig. 8. is easy to see in Fig. 9. The straightened version of the right side knot at bottom shows the alternation of the twisted two threads, one sinusoid and one rectangular.

(if continued at bottom over 6-fol rotations). The two threads are alternating in the twisted system of the knot, only the shape of the threads changes (there are sinusoid and rectangular threads).
Fig. 10. Transformation of knots with 3 threads from the rotational representation (knot figure) into the straightened one (divided to threads along a line) by the crossing radius vector circulating one circle around the center of the structure.

Fig. 10. analyses the only 3 thread knot on the Sueso ornamental jug. For comparison the simple knot with C8 structure woven from 3 equivalent threads is shown. Its straightened pattern with threads exhibits the equivalence of all 3 alternating threads. They are twisted with each other by g (glide reflection) type frieze pattern along the line. Our Seuso knot has not this characteristics.
At the bottom figure the Seuso knot is analysed. Its straightened pattern with threads exhibits the non-equivalence of the 3 alternating threads. There is one thread (dotted) which is always running in the upper region and does not sink to the bottom. (This characteristics can be observed visually in the knot by the fact that the dotted line – the ring - stays in the outer portion of the two other rings.) The other two (empty) threads are equivalent. This non-equivalence is also visible on the knot represeantation.
Summary
The Seuso jug with geometric ornamentation has knots mainly with C4 rotational group symmetry (2.1, 2.3, 3.1, 3.3, 4.1, 4.3). There is one with C8 (2.2) and one with D4 (1.2) dihedral group symmetry. The plane symmetry patterns with 4-fold rotational symmetry are all represented: p4m (1.1, 1.3), p4g (2.2), and p4 (the frame net of the jug). This rich set of 4-fold symmetry variants proves that the goldsmith master of the jug had excellent ornamental mathematical knowledge. Ornamental art may always be a storehouse for examples for the ethnomathematical representations. The Seuso jug preserved a brilliant heritage from the master of Pannonia, from the Roman Age, in this sense, too. Therefore this jug of the Seuso Treasury gives a possibility to enjoy beauties of geometry and reveal ethnomathematics of the Roman Age.

FARKAS, Flórián
Talya G.A Solan — Singer with Soul
Recently I have been searching on Internet for Sephardic music and I have come across the name of Talya G.A Solan. Her music enchanted me instantly and I have requested from her an interview in order to make her better known to the readership of the Journal of Eurasian Studies. She consented immediately and we have had a pleasant talk on October 15, 2014, using Skype. You can find the outcome of our discussion on the following pages.
***
Flórián Farkas: Recently I was preparing a lecture on Kabbalah and I wished to have some nice Sephardic music for background listening. In this way I came across you singing the Ladino song Morena me llaman, performed in Wroclaw. I became so enchanted that I could not listen to your singing in ‘background mode’. Your singing is not simply music but an expression of your inner self, which comes across without any doubt.
Talya G.A Solan: The Wroclaw concert was a very pleasant one. I was not even aware that somebody filmed it and after the concert I was contemplating what a pity that we have not let it recorded. Later I discovered that somebody just did that and posted it on YouTube! The public was very receptive and enthusiastic and that gave us lot of energy. In fact it took place in a restored synagogue, in the old Jewish quarter of Wroclaw. It is nice to experience that the synagogue is a kind of cultural center, an active place where lots of events take place. It houses several museums, too.
FF: Next to the Internet postings do you have recorded CDs as well? I could not locate any on major Internet retailers.
TS: My music is a niche and it is always fine to have exposure. On the other hand I have two CDs, released in Israel. The one is with The Israeli Ethnic Ensemble, the other is with my other group — Yamma Ensemble.
FF: Could you tell me more of these CDs?

TS: Most of the music I sing with The Israeli Ethnic Ensemble connects with my Ladino roots. My grandmother came from a Sephardic family from Plovdiv, Bulgaria. She and my mother spoke that language actively, a kind of secret language. Though I do not speak it actively, when my friends in Spain heard me singing exclaimed: what an ancient Spanish it is! With Yamma my singing is focused on Hebrew; it is my original own music. I like very much to sing in Hebrew, original and traditional music. I also like very much to write poetry. The ancient biblical text of the Psalms or the Song of Songs inspires me a lot. I have read the Song of Songs more than thousand times but its metaphorical nature still does not fail to fascinate and inspire me.
For me the strongest sense is hearing. I experience the world specially through my ears — the beauty of sound, of the language. I do not care how people look like, what color their eyes or hair are, how muscular their body is, I am always listening and I am captured by the sound. Everything starts with alef. The ear is the real thing, all the rest is just the lie of the external side. My world is made up of sounds, voices, intonation.
FF: How did your inner voice develop? In my view this cannot be learned, it has to come naturally.
TS: I am the only musician in the family. All my colleagues in Israel are coming from families with a lot of musical tradition. On the other hand also my sisters are dealing with the sound. They are teachers of Hebrew and Arabic, so the sound of the language is playing a very important role in their lives as well.
My music is not the music of the stars. When I was 30 years old, I was somehow sad of that but then the contra-bassist of the band replied to me: and how many musicians can sing what you sing when they are 20? Obviously not so many. Hence it goes with a certain age, personality, experience, maturity. When

I was a teenager I wished to become a pop singer. Now it is totally different. I am very happy with the choice I have made. The music I am singing is my real myself.
FF: Are you a professional musician?
TS: Until 10 years ago I have worked full time as a researcher for TV and media productions. The music had a smaller place in my day. I have not perfomed professionally.
Since then I am focusing mainly on music, however I still work from time to time in researching when an interesting suggestion appears.
Next to these activities I also founded a not-for-profit organization named Music Port (www.musicport.org.il) with the aim of helping Israeli musicians to perform out of Israel, which is not an easy task. It is in pilot phase focusing right now on ethnic, folk, and jazz, later hopefully we can include other genres too. It is not for starts but for those who are less known and are without agents, etc. Classical music has a lot of support from the government though. I wish to deal with the beauty of life and to help others as well.
FF: You have quite an amazing family background. On your mother side you are from Bulgaria and from the father side from the Yemen...

TS: Yes, on my mother side they came from Spain to Bulgaria, then in 1947 to Israel. I owe many beautiful things to my grandmother: the beautiful language, excellent food... Her ancestors were expelled from Spain in 1492 and then went to Bulgaria, which was at that time part of the Ottoman Empire. The Muslim world of then was much more tolerant than Christian Europe. This year I visited Cordoba where I was invited together with my group to the 13th International Sephardic Festival. I also visited the Jewish quarter, which houses a museum now, the Museum of Inquisition, where all kind of torture instruments are displaced. Its dark, cruel atmosphere made a deep impression on me. I have written a travelogue in Hebrew, which was then translated to English by a Jewish blog in the US.
My father’s family comes from Yemen. They came to Israel in 1943 and they are a traditional Yemenite family. Nevertheless, I was much more influenced by my mother side. My look is Yemenite but my voice and the color of it is Bulgarian. It comes to me more easily to sing in the Bulgarian style, the Yemenite technique is more difficult. There is a Bulgarian women choir, who released a wonderful album: Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares. They are amazing; they are a great inspiration to me. They mostly perform Bulgarian traditional music, but here they sing Sephardic music: A señora novia .
FF: Do you speak Bulgarian?
TS: Unfortunately not. Granny, who passed away, spoke it.

FF: Have you visited Bulgaria?
TS: Yes, I even gave a concert at the Bansko Jazz Festival. In Bulgaria I have had an interesting encounter with my culinarian heritage. In Bulgaria they prepare the stuffed pepper with lots of different cheeses, unlike in Morocco where it is stuffed with rice and meat. It was exactly as my granny prepared it!
FF: How much time do you spend on tours?
TS: It depends. The political situation plays also a role in it. I will be for 2 weeks in December 2014 in Switzerland with the Kedem Ensemble, which is an international group and I am touring with them as a guest. Then I will have a full month tour in March 2015 in Germany. (04.03.2015 Düsseldorf, 08.03.2015 Meschede, 10.03.2015 Kempen, 11.03.2015 Gelsenkirchen, 12.03.2015 Remscheid, 13.03.2015 Siegen, 15.03.2015 Sankt Augustin, 17.03.2015 Hamm, 18.03.2015 Köln, 19.03.2015 Wuppertal, 20.03.2015 Detmold, 21.03.2015 Paderborn, 26.03.2015 Gütersloh, 27.03.2015 Aachen)
FF: What is your favorite concert setting?
TS: I prefer small, intimate spaces, like churches. I love to feel and see the faces of people in front of me.
FF: As you mentioned your musical upbringing was not rooted in the family. Who was/were your teacher(s)?
TS: I studied at the Tel Aviv University but I did not take any operatic studies there, though I studied the theory of music. In parallel I took private classes with Mrs. Rachel Hochman. I feel myself privileged that Mrs. Rachel Hochman, Israel's greatest voice productions teacher accepted me and became my voice coach. I am working with her more than 10 years now. She is the best teacher because she teaches not only voice and breathing techniques but she coaches me on a journey, on my inner Tao.
She taught me among others things that sincerity is the most important one in an artist’s life; that I need to understand myself. I knew from the very beginning that I wanted to sing, but I did not know what. I was at that time raw material. It is a false myth that one can become an instant star. And she helped me with this process. With her guidance I realized that as a teenager I was more screaming than singing. She taught me to be controlled, civilized, how to build up a performance. She has had the greatest influence on my musical personality.
FF: Did she also help you find your genre?

TS: Actually yes. Thanks to her I have experienced various music styles like pop, musicals, jazz, blues, even classic...
One of the significant events I have experienced regarding my musical path occurred during a university lecture. The lecturer demonstrated us how the Israeli music has come into existence: every immigrant took his/her musical heritage and then matched them to a Hebrew text, and voilà! Finally he put on a Ladino song from his private collection. I immediately was bewitched. Rachel, who also comes from a Bulgarian Sephardic family, immediately realized that this style fits my voice and music personality. She directed me toward this beautiful musical heritage. She also emphasized that the oud is very suitable to my voice. Oud is my favorite instrument. Its sound goes straight to the heart, it is emotional, one feels the desert, the earth, everything. The oud is considered the piano of the Middle East, because it best reflects the musical traditions of this region.
So in the end I ended up singing Sephardic music. I had it in my blood but I discovered it from outside.
FF: Outside performing what does music mean for you?
TS: I need to be very economical with my time. Therefore I do not have a TV set, I do not need it. What I need I can find on the Internet and what is paramount is to have a good sound system.

MIRABILE, Françoise
Un Renouvellement de la Pensée juive au XVIème siècle par le
Maharal de Prague, ou la Recherche de la dimension moyenne
1
entre
Révélation et Science
Dans des temps où l'on peine encore à réconcilier foi et raison, où se dressent face à face les camps retranchés du positivisme persistant et des intégrismes religieux, où l'on ne fait que perpétuer l'antique débat entre Athènes et Jérusalem, nous souhaitons mettre en avant la belle figure d'un précurseur non satisfait des oppositions simples, héritier de sa tradition religieuse (le judaïsme), et à l'écoute des avancées de la science contemporaine, en dialogue avec les esprits scientifiques qui concoururent au XVIème siècle par leurs recherches révolutionnaires au développement de l'humanisme.
Juda Loeb ben Bezalel qu'on nomme couramment le Maharal de Prague est plus souvent associé au folklore pragois et à la légende fantastique du Golem. C'est une bien singulière réduction de cette immense personnalité.
Pendant quatre siècles, son oeuvre fut écartée, oubliée. Depuis la seconde moitié du XXème siècle, quelques chercheurs juifs français ont remis à l'honneur les études maharaliennes, et si son oeuvre reste datée historiquement, elle apparaît d'une actualité étonnante sur des points essentiels, dans la quête de comprendre l'homme et le monde dans une ouverture métaphysique sans rien lâcher sur la physique, dans une tension dynamisante entre des systèmes mentaux facilement jugés incompatibles. La démarche du Maharal révèle une rare ouverture de l'esprit humain, ouverture qui invite à la différente et nécessaire voie de la conciliation, de la réconciliation entre divers mondes, en vue d'harmoniser les apparentes contradictions de notre vécu, de créer les conditions favorables d'une plénitude, shalom en hébreu, de trouver la juste position de l'homme dans son monde et dans sa relation au Créateur.
Si certaines explications ponctuelles du Maharal peuvent apparaître dépassées par les avancées scientifiques ou exégétiques (par exemple la Cabbale lourianique) son positionnement intellectuel reste largement à l'avant-garde, ce qui lui valut dès son vivant une totale incompréhension jusque dans sa communauté. Conscient que notre monde traverse des étapes de maturation intellectuelle et spirituelle qui s'enracinent dans la connaissance physique et le développement historique des sociétés, il met en tension les divers pôles, tendant vers le dépassement des contradictions, en recherche de nouveaux équilibres, qui à leur tour donneront à penser de nouvelles contradictions et porteront vers de nouvelles étapes de la conscience humaine en évitant peut-être la traversée de chaos, de gestations violentes, lentes et souvent contre-productives que peuvent être les conflits politiques et ou armés.
Le Maharal fut un grand esprit qui éclaire encore notre route. Il éclaire l'Ecriture de l'acuité de son intelligence, de son érudition et d'un amour ardent et zélé. Précurseur, il a l'intuition très forte qu'un

temps nouveau s'ouvre dans les relations entre Israël et les nations sous le signe d'un dialogue certes difficile mais bien réel.
Oui, le Maharal s'inscrit dans la lignée des passeurs, des transmetteurs qui ouvrent notre intelligence et notre coeur avec simplicité et humilité, nous incitant à voir plus loin, plus haut.
Mais commençons par dissiper quelques malentendus, pour faire le partage entre légende et réalité, afin de mesurer l'exacte ampleur du personnage.
LA LEGENDE
Le Maharal vécut au siècle de la Renaissance, de 1512 à 1609, à la fois célèbre et méconnu, entre mythe et réalité. Né à Worms ou à Poznan où il passa les 40 premières années de sa vie, il exerça la charge de rabbin en Moravie entre 40 et 60 ans, puis fut appelé sur Prague, repartit à Poznan avant de revenir jusqu'à sa mort à Prague.
Pour fêter le quatrecentenaire de sa mort, a été inauguré en septembre 2008 un Institut Du Maharal de Prague dont la vocation est de familiariser le public avec son oeuvre. Une école talmudique pour la formation des rabbins était prévue. Selon le Grand Rabbin d'Israël Yona Metzger, on trouve ses oeuvres dans toutes les Yechivot (Maisons d'Etudes du Talmud et des commentaires traditionnels). Pourtant, longtemps son nom fut surtout associé à la légende du Golem, sur la base d'un manuscrit contesté, qui daterait de 1583, Niflaot Maharal (Récits Merveilleux du Maharal). Si l'on en croit Gershom Scholem, ce manuscrit serait le fait d'un mystificateur, Judel Rosenberg. Les recherches plus récentes d'Arnold Goldsmith concluent prudemment à la plus grande incertitude. Selon la légende, le Haut Rabbi Loeb est l'inventeur aux pouvoirs "surnaturels", le créateur du Golem, un automate pétri d'argile, projection de son Maître, sans âme, sosie silencieux. Le Golem est envoyé en mission pour sauver des juifs des communautés en danger. Son Maître le commande par un signe métaphysique composé de trois lettres hébraïques ( א מ ת ) apparaissant sur son front. Ces trois lettres se lisent /emet/ et signifient ''vérité''. A l'approche du Chabbat, le Maître du Golem enlève le א, ne laissant que les deux lettres מ ת qui signifient ''mort'', ce qui inhibe en l'automate toute activité le temps où le maître ne peut le contrôler. Mais le récit relate, qu'un soir de Chabbat, le Maître oublia de retirer le א. Pendant la durée du Chabbat, où le Maître était lui-même contraint à l'inactivité, le Golem échappa à son autorité, se révolta et commença à détruire le ghetto de Prague. Au terme du Chabbat, le Maître rattrapa le Golem et arracha définitivement de son front le א, provoquant sa mort.

Le Golem face à son créateur
Si donc le Rabbi de la légende n'est pas le Maharal, qui est le Maharal ? Sans doute ce rabbin suscitat-il une fascination propice à la légende par son étonnante longévité. Il mourut à 97 ans et resta créatif, actif dans son grand âge, bien heureusement pour nous puisqu'il commença à rédiger ses oeuvres très tardivement, à soixante ans passés. Le personnage apparaît énigmatique, puissant, atypique: nulle part dans ses oeuvres, il ne fait référence à aucun maître, fait rarissime dans la tradition juive. On peut dire, avec le rabbin Claude Sultan, qu'il "s'est fait tout seul"2. Rabbin, érudit, cabbaliste, de là à penser qu'il appartint à quelque société occulte!
Une méprise courante fait reconnaître dans la haute statue du Maharal, sculptée en 1912 par Ladislas Saloun et placée dans une niche de l'Hôtel de Ville du quartier juif à Prague, le Docteur Johann Georg Faust, autre personnage de l'époque qui inspira aux écrivains des récits où s'entremêlent les thèmes de la vie, de la mort, de l'éternelle jeunesse, illustrant le drame de l'existence humaine.

Statue du Maharal Hôtel de Ville Prague
A l'origine, deux hommes bien réels qui vécurent au 16ème siècle, le Maharal et le Docteur Faust, érudit humaniste qui étudia en Europe orientale, s'intéressa à tous les champs de savoir, y compris celui de la Cabale. Déconcertant, intriguant, il fut soupçonné d'avoir passé un pacte avec le diable: il aurait vendu son âme en échange d'une connaissance absolue, totale. Il se serait livré à des pratiques de magie noire et serait mort dans les flammes de l'enfer. Fut-il en réalité brûlé sur les bûchers de l'Inquisition? Ou mourut-il dans l'explosion de son laboratoire de chimie? Nul ne le sait.
Les deux mythes du Golem et de Faust, dont on suit l'évolution dans un certain nombre d'oeuvres artistiques (Goethe, Berlioz, Schönberg...), se développent parallèlement. La légende du Golem symbolise une connaissance qui accède à la maîtrise même de la vie, le Maître y prend la place du Créateur, tout comme Faust défie les lois de la Création en prétendant acheter une éternelle jeunesse. Cette interprétation constitue une méconnaissance totale des travaux du Maharal. Le rapprochement avec le Docteur Faust fut utilisé pour faire du Maharal un personnage machiavélique qui venait conforter les idées reçues de l'antijudaïsme traditionnel. Le réduire au créateur du Golem, c'était à la fois ignorer sa brillante intelligence, ses facultés rationnelles et démonstatives pour en faire un alchimiste douteux travaillant dans son antre à des complots inavouables, des projets hérétiques. Le Maharal, tout comme le Docteur Faustus, inquiètent et fascinent tout ensemble par leur très large savoir, leur connaissance polyvalente. Le protestant hérétique et le juif sont associés dans un même imaginaire sur

la base de quelques points communs. Or donc, la statue sur la Place de l'Hôtel de Ville à Prague représente bien le Maharal, hommage à cette grande figure de la ville et de la communauté juive3.
A LA CROISEE DE LA TRADITION ET DE LA MODERNITE
Quelle est donc la teneur de cette oeuvre? S'il est un grand érudit de la tradition juive, il est aussi un philosophe humaniste, passionné des découvertes de la Renaissance, en particulier dans le domaine de l'astronomie. A l'opposé de bien des rabbins d'Europe Orientale, il n'est pas question pour lui d'ignorer les sciences profanes, il s'y intéresse de très près. Si l'étude de la Torah est à ses yeux la science la plus haute en tant qu'elle informe, modèle la conduite et l'existence de l'homme juif, les sciences profanes permettent de progresser dans la connaissance du monde d'en-bas. Il n'y a pas contradiction, incompatibilité avec la connaissance religieuse, mais rappel des limites de notre entendement. L'homme a reçu une révélation qui le soutient dans sa marche vers Dieu, mais il a aussi été créé avec une raison qu'il doit exercer. La confrontation à la nature, à la matière est riche d'enseignements et nullement à ignorer ou à rejeter. Le Maharal vit dans un environnement qui favorise son intérêt pour les sciences. Rodolphe II, empereur de la dynastie des Hasbourg depuis 1576, réside à Prague qu'il transforme en une grande capitale qu'il souhaite voir rivaliser avec Rome, Florence, Paris ou Rotterdam.

L'empereur, homme de la Renaissance, fait de Prague un îlot de tolérance religieuse. Il est mécène des savants, invite Tyro Braché en 1599 à installer son observatoire tout près de Prague dans le château de Benatek. Rodolphe II préside lui-même des colloques scientifiques au palais de Hradshen. Tyro Braché tente la conciliation de l'ancien système astronomique de Ptolémée et des découvertes de Copernic sur l'héliocentrisme. Jean Kepler, élève de Tyro Braché lui succédera et établira, quant à lui, les trois fameuses lois sur la forme ovoïde des orbites planétaires, sur l'harmonie du monde et sur la contradiction. David Ganz, astronome juif et familier du Maharal, fréquente l'observatoire et tient son maître informé des recherches les plus récentes. L'astronomie, depuis l'Antiquité, est au coeur de la réflexion philosophique et métaphysique. La parenté avec la pensée du Maharal est frappante, puisque ce dernier fera de la force de contradiction une force organisatrice de l'infinité des perceptions du monde créé.
L'originalité du Maharal est de s'inscrire dans la Tradition, d'être fidèle aux enseignements de ses Pères, tout en acceptant de les confronter aux savoirs contemporains, afin de garder la Tradition vivante, de ne pas l'enfermer dans une croyance figée et stérile. Talmudiste et cabbaliste (la cabbale étant bien sûr comprise comme le courant mystique de la tradition juive, qui s'appuie sur une exégèse très fine du texte biblique et qui vise à progresser vers ce que la Tradition appelle חכמת הנסתר /'hokhmat hanistar/ ''sagesse de ce qui est caché''. Nous sommes loin ici des connotations péjoratives associées au mot ''cabbale'', du fait de l'exploitation qu'en firent nombre de charlatans, la réduisant à des pratiques superstitieuses, occultes, de magie noire, utilisation d'amulettes et de médailles, talismans, ... souvent gravés de caractères hébreux déformés, d'étoiles de David, pratique abusive de la guematria (interprétations reposant sur la valeur numérique des lettres), de la permutation des lettres, des calculs sur les Noms divins. La cabbale sans une connaissance précise de la langue et de l'écriture hébraïques, des textes de la tradition n'a plus de sens et devient mystificatrice.
Un des objectifs du Maharal est précisément de lutter contre l'obscurantisme malveillant qui entoure la science cabalistique à la fois méprisée et galvaudée, c'est pourquoi il exprime sous forme philosophique les savoirs cachés de la Cabale. Il reprend la matière de l'enseignement juif traditionnel et en fait, livre après livre, un commentaire dans des termes philosophiques. Il en explicite le sens, en excellent pédagogue qu'il est. Il parle à l'homme de son temps qui n'entend plus le langage des temps anciens et en a perdu le sens, notamment à cause de la vie en exil. Il réussit la synthèse dynamique de ce qui apparaissait jusqu'alors inconciliable, le rationalisme de Maïmonide et la mystique du Zohar

, réunifie deux courants de la pensée juive qui depuis le Moyen Age paraissaient incompatibles: celui de Maïmonide pour qui la raison, universelle, doit permettre par une autre voie de confirmer les vérités de la Révélation; celui de Juda Halévy pour qui la raison a ses limites et est inadaptée pour rendre compte de la métaphysique.

Le Zohar est l'ouvrage fondateur de la Cabale. C'est un commentaire qui développe le quatrième niveau de lecture, סוד /sod/ « secret », de la Tradition rabbinique, le sens initiatique du texte biblique. Les trois premiers niveaux sont le sens premier, פשט /pschatt/, le sens approfondi מדרש /midrash/ et l'allusion רמז /remez/.

Je me réfère pour l'explication de ce concept et les exemples à l'excellent commentaire d'André Neher, dans son livre portant le même titre que celui du Maharal, Le Puits de l'Exil, voir les sources en fin d'article.

harmonisation des contraires; il préfigure Hegel et sa dialectique à trois termes. André Neher explicite avec bonheur la pensée novatrice du Maharal sur ce point. Il part du constat d'une structure dialogale dans la Bible qui commence par la lettre ב /beth/, valeur numérique deux. Cette structure dialogale fait écho à des thèmes structurés sur des oppositions, des polarités qui organisent la matière de notre monde. Ces polarités peuvent être complémentaires (la cause et l'effet, le général et le particulier, l'un et le multiple); elles peuvent être antithétiques (le physique opposé à la métaphysique, l'acte à la puissance, l'ascension à la chute, le donnant à l'accueillant) ou contradictoires (comme l'être et le néant). Le Maharal, humaniste, au fait des grandes découvertes de son époque, participe par ses commentaires à donner une large autonomie à l'homme, libre et pensant, face à un Dieu créateur avec qui il coopère afin d'achever la Création. Le Maharal pose ainsi ce qu'André Neher appelle une thèse horizontale
6
, celle de la créativité autonome de l'homme, située au plan de l'immanence, sans aucun recours à la transcendance. Humanisme, science, recherche, doute, tolérance ont droit de cité dans sa pensée. Puis, il place cette thèse horizontale au regard d'une antithèse verticale: le ciel au regard de la terre, la métaphysique au regard de la physique, Dieu, Absolu écrasant devant lequel l'homme ne peut plus être que prière, poussière, néant. Comment faire entrer l'Absolu de Dieu dans le relatif de l'homme? Dieu, s'il est, est Tout, et l'homme tend par sa raison à rendre compte du monde en se passant de Dieu. Le Maharal cherche la clé qui permet de concilier l'horizontale et la verticale. La synthèse surgit de la contradiction fondamentale par la dimension moyenne et appelle conjointement Dieu et l'homme à une coopération difficile mais inéluctable.
L'humanisme du Maharal consiste à enjamber le gouffre qui sépare la Torah du monde, et Israël de l'humanité. Sans renoncer à l'autorité de la Révélation, il admet un univers dégagé de cette autorité. La Révélation, verticale, pour rejoindre l'horizontale du monde, doit emprunter une voie diagonale. Le Maharal met en place une théologie de la relativité, à deux faces, deux perspectives ou deux polarités, le donnant et l'accueillant, le נותן /noten/ et le מקבל /meqabel/. Ainsi, pour le Maharal, la Torah parle le langage des hommes, du fait de l'inachèvement de l'homme qui la reçoit ; s'ensuivent une diffraction, une distorsion, un écart entre le message divin originel et sa réception par l'homme. Ce n'est pas une conception négative de l'homme mais dynamique: l'homme est, selon l'expression d'André Neher, une « terre germinante »
7
, il est accueil, réceptacle, organisateur de l'univers divin dans l'ici-bas.
A l'opposé du principe de non contradiction de la philosophie classique, le Maharal voit dans la contradiction une force organisatrice. La coexistence des contraires est possible et nécessaire: ainsi la création est finie et infinie, l'homme physique et métaphysique. La contrariété pose la différence des êtres, fait prendre conscience de ce qui n'appartient qu'à l'autre et me fait défaut, ce qui permet un mouvement vers la plénitude.
La troisième dimension, moyenne, אמצע /emtsa/ a pour fonction d'arbitrer les extrêmes, d'absorber les essences contradictoires. La dualité suppose une unité première dans la cause que la dimension moyenne va permettre de rejoindre par le dépassement des contraires: ainsi, c'est l'agressivité, le désir d'annuler l'autre, qui naît de la différence entre les hommes dans le monde de la nature (Caïn et Abel). Cette opposition se résoud par la troisième dimension, l'amour du prochain où chacun a sa part ( מחלוקת

/ma'hloqet/ « controverse » et חלק /'heleq/ « part »). L'amour est, par excellence, la dimension moyenne, /emtsa/ dans laquelle un être se distingue d'un autre tout en cherchant à établir une relation positive, respectueuse avec l'autre, un être-avec. La relation d'à-côté ou d'opposant se transmue en relation d'Alliance.
Autre exemple: entre l'homme et Dieu, le point de convergence, la dimension moyenne, est la Torah qui leur permet de se rejoindre par la mise en place de l'Alliance. Un midrash (récit traditionnel de la littérature rabbinique) nous éclaire justement sur cette relation « Les Tables (de la Loi données par Dieu à Moïse) avaient une largeur de 6 palmes. Deux étaient dans les mains de Dieu, deux entre les mains de Moïse, au milieu /emtsa/, deux palmes étaient vides. »
8
Le Maharal est le premier commentateur à observer que le Don de la Torah est rendu possible par le vide entre Dieu et l'homme. Chacun participe à la mise en place de ce vide: Dieu se retire (c'est ce que la Cabale appelle le צמצום /tsimtsoum/), אל שדי /El Chaddai/ est le « Dieu qui dit assez », se limite de manière à laisser un espace au monde, sinon il avalerait tout. L'homme manifeste également un vide, l'humilité, première et essentielle qualité de Moïse qui a vocation d'intermédiaire, élément moyen entre Dieu et son peuple. Par cette humilité, l'homme prend conscience de sa condition de créature née de la bienveillance de Dieu et de ses parents. Ainsi émerge la possibilité de coopérer avec Dieu. Le vide initial est une « zone neutre » entre les deux partenaires qui illustre l'essence de l'Alliance, le tissage sans cesse réactualisé de la relation.
La dimension moyenne, /emtsa/, peut aussi être définie comme centre, point d'organisation, d'unification, de perfection d'une chose. Unité, équilibre qui englobe les parties, lieu du possible, elle ouvre le monde physique au métaphysique.
Cette dimension moyenne correspond symboliquement au chiffre trois sous la figure du triangle, dont le troisième côté organise la figure et lui donne sens. Ainsi, le Patriarche central, c'est Jacob (le troisième patriarche après Abraham et Isaac) en devenir d'Israël, la tribu centrale est celle de Lévi (la troisième après celles de Ruben et Simon), et l'homme central, c'est Moïse (le troisième enfant après Aaron et Myriam). Le /emtsa/, pour le Maharal, est aussi le lieu de l'élection, c'est en lui que Dieu choisit les choses, les hommes, le peuple dont il fait les acteurs sacrés de l'histoire.
Nous entrevoyons là la puissance de pensée du Maharal, son apport essentiel: il structure les données d'un savoir traditionnel d'une manière nouvelle, fait ressortir des perspectives. Ainsi naît son projet de réforme pédagogique, opposé à l'enseignement pratiqué dans les écoles talmudiques, en particulier la rhétorique du פילפול /pilpoul/
9
. Ce projet a pour but de structurer et de hiérarchiser l'étude, de donner le sens du développement de la Loi. Son souci principal, dans ses grands sermons à Poznan ou à Prague, dans son enseignement religieux et éthique est de lutter contre le processus de décadence culturelle dans le monde juif, de rassembler les Juifs autour de leurs valeurs spécifiques qui déterminent la mission d'Israël, à savoir réparer la faille ontologique de la Création et coopérer à son achèvement. Les Juifs doivent pour cela se garder de l'assimilation et être conscients de leur responsabilité dans l'histoire universelle. Ils ne doivent pas non plus vivre repliés sur leurs communautés et ignorer leur

Le pilpoul est une méthode de raisonnement sur les textes talmudiques qui consiste en une argumentation serrée entre deux étudiants et qui vise à trouver l'unité cachée derrière les opinions divergentes des Maîtres. Dans son développement, le pilpoul peut devenir pure rhétorique, c'est pourquoi il est critiqué par certains rabbins.

environnement, alors que la tentation de rejeter les sciences profanes et les évolutions sociales est grande à l'aube du monde moderne. Grâce au soutien financier du banquier Maïsel, le Maharal fonde une école talmudique mais ne lui donne pas le nom traditionnel de Yechiva (Maison d'Etudes), signe de la distance critique qu'il entretient avec sa communauté.
BIEN EN AVANCE SUR SON TEMPS
Il fut à la fois admiré comme un grand Maître et rejeté. La communauté juive se méfia beaucoup de lui, c'est pourquoi, par exemple, il ne fut nommé Grand Rabbin de Prague que très tardivement. Il fut de fait le chef spirituel de la communauté de Prague bien des années avant de recevoir, en 1597, le titre de Grand Rabbin à l'âge de 85 ans. On ne connaît pas précisément les raisons de ses va-et-vient d'une ville à l'autre. Sans doute furent-ils liés à ces relations difficiles avec les autorités de la communauté de Prague, il dérangeait, bousculait, faisait entendre un discours qui remettait en cause les pratiques, l'enseignement, les convictions d'une communauté repliée sur elle-même, refusant la modernité, la diabolisant volontiers. Pourtant, il se mettait au service de sa communauté, controversait avec les jésuites, luttait pour obtenir l'annulation de décrets d'expulsion qui pouvaient frapper certains membres de la communauté juive. Les Juifs dépendaient alors de la Chambre Royale et subissaient régulièrement des pogroms, le Maharal était homme de dialogue, de paix.
Le Maharal reprochait à la nation juive de ne pas accueillir la modernité, il souhaitait un réveil culturel et spirituel, cherchait à redonner la conscience de l'identité juive, dans la ligne de Juda Halévy qui vécut au XIIème siècle en Espagne, à cette époque étonnante où le monde juif, au contact des musulmans, connut une activité intellectuelle et spirituelle qui concilia tradition et modernité.
Témoin de la démarche du Maharal, de sa lutte dans son temps et avec son temps pour une insertion du monde juif dans la société de son époque, fut son étonnante rencontre avec Rodolphe II, rencontre souhaitée par l'empereur austro-hongrois, fait rarissime, car c'étaient en général les responsables des communautés juives qui sollicitaient une entrevue avec les autorités étatiques. La teneur de leur entrevue demeura secrète et bien des rumeurs circulèrent. Cette rencontre avec Rodolphe II témoignait d'une recherche universelle, de la conscience forte de l'articulation du destin du peuple juif et de celle de l'humanité qui n'était pas alors à l'ordre du jour. Pour le Maharal, cette rencontre revêtit une importance essentielle, représentant un tournant capital dans les relations entre le peuple juif et les nations. Peu de temps après cette rencontre, dans son sermon de Pentecôte de 1592, il déclara qu'une nuit venait de s'achever dans l'histoire d'Israël et que toute l'humanité entrait dans une époque nouvelle, celle de l'aube. A l'écroulement du Temple et de l'Etat juif avaient succédé de longs siècles de marginalisation et de persécutions dont l'événement phare et tragique était l'expulsion des Juifs d'Espagne en 1492. Désormais, dit-il, Israël et les nations entraient dans une phase de dialogue, de compagnonnage. Il appuyait son argumentation sur un midrash, celui des 3 veilles10

Sans doute Rodolphe et le Maharal avaient-ils un rêve commun, né d'une intuition: après les chocs successifs liés aux découvertes de leur siècle et l'effondrement des théories de l'Ancien Monde, il était possible de réorganiser en un tout spirituel cohérent la connaissance en un humanisme à la fois physique et métaphysique. La question à résoudre était grandiose: comment rester homme avec Dieu tout en s'affirmant homme autonome face à Dieu ?
LA METHODE DE SON COMMENTAIRE ET SES ENJEUX
La base des commentaires du Maharal est la recherche du sens dans la Haggadah talmudique et les midrachim
11
dont les auteurs sont les Sages d'Israël qui mirent par écrit cette fort ancienne tradition entre le troisième et le neuvième siècles. Les enseignements de cette littérature aggadique furent longtemps mal compris et souvent dénigrés, en milieu chrétien et même en milieu juif. La polémique entre juifs et chrétiens, la rivalité qui les opposa longtemps est à l'origine du rejet des interprétations du texte biblique qui sont consignées dans le Talmud et les divers recueils de commentaires des érudits juifs. Les chrétiens s'approprièrent le texte biblique en l'introduisant dans leur propre canon, le relisant dans une perspective strictement christologique, excluant toute autre interprétation jugée caduque. Le peuple juif dans la théologie de la substitution fut réduit à un peuple témoin de l'origine, déchu, rejeté par Dieu au profit du “Nouvel Israël”, l'Eglise; de même les textes juifs furent disqualifiés. L'objet des célèbres controverses du Moyen Age était de condamner, d'établir comme mensongères les démonstrations du Talmud
12
. En tant que minorité religieuse dans une société très christianisée, la marge de manoeuvre pour défendre leurs textes était, pour les juifs, très étroite.
Comme le juif était tout juste toléré dans la société, on méprisa l'ensemble du judaïsme. Le Talmud devint comme le martèlent les clichés antijuifs les plus répandus “un fatras d'inepties, un fouillis inextricable ...”, les Sages d'Israël furent décrits comme faibles d'esprit, ne sachant ni raisonner ni démontrer.
13
Mais la critique ne venait pas que des chrétiens. A partir de la Renaissance, certains intellectuels juifs, épris de l'esprit des Lumières, amoureux de la rationalité grecque et des sciences, rejetèrent aussi bien des passages des commentaires juifs traditionnels, s'appliquant à mettre en évidence ce qu'ils appelaient des incohérences, des impossibilités logiques ou historiques, en s'appuyant sur le développement des sciences nouvelles. Le Maharal polémiqua en particulier avec son contemporain, Azaria dei Rossi, un juif érudit italien qui, jugeant que certains midrashim étaient absurdes, prit le parti d'en prendre et d'en
11
La אגדה /aggada/ dans le Talmud et les מדרשים /midrashim/ sont les commentaires des Sages d'Israël, présentés sous une forme narrative. La racine du mot אגדה /aggada/, יגד ou נגד , signifie dire, raconter, la aggada est donc un récit. La racine du mot מדרש /midrash/, דרש , signifie chercher, scruter, enquêter. Un midrash explore le texte biblique et fait émerger des sens non apparents. Parmi les techniques qu'il utilise, la parabole ou le récit parallèle

Voir par exemple la Controverse de Barcelone où le rabbin et célèbre commentateur Nahmanide affronte Pablo Christiani, juif converti devenu évêque.
13
Il est à noter qu'au XXème siècle, après la tragédie de la Shoah, l'Eglise se livra à une révision complète de ses positions envers le judaïsme et les juifs. La déclaration Nostra Aetate, document conciliaire de 1962, rend compte de ce tournant majeur dans la vie de l'Eglise qui rouvre le dialogue et le débat entre les deux religions.

laisser. Pour le Maharal, les enseignements des Sages furent écrits sous inspiration divine et une telle attitude était irrecevable.
Dans באר הגולה /Beer ha-Golah/, Le Puits de l'Exil
14
, apologie de la littérature aggadique, et dont André Neher donna un lumineux commentaire dans un livre du même titre, le Maharal résuma les critiques les plus courantes adressées à ces enseignements, les classant en 7 catégories et répondant point par point aux attaques:
Première critique : Les Sages n'ont pas respecté l'Ecriture (Dt 4,2 “vous n'ajouterez rien à ce que je vous ordonne et vous n'en retrancherez rien ...”), ils ont ajouté ou retranché à la Torah de Moïse, par exemple de nouvelles prescriptions dans la Michnah et le Talmud.
Réponse: les Rabbins ne font qu'expliciter les préceptes de la Torah. Les mesures définies par les Sages ont pour but de dresser une haie autour de la Torah, de la protéger, elles font corps avec l'essence de la Torah.
Deuxième critique : Les Sages ont donné des enseignements aberrants.
Réponse: ce qui vient de l'intelligence divine exige beaucoup d'étude et de réflexion; les enseignements paraissent aberrants car on est pas entré dans leur profondeur.
Troisième critique : Exégèse abusive qui s'écarte de l'usage de la langue et du sens obvie de l'Ecriture.
Réponse: les Sages disent “Laisse faire le verset qui se fraie lui-même un chemin vers son interprétation”. Image de l'arbre: la racine correspond au sens littéral qui se ramifie en une infinité de branches. Un verset se partage en une infinité de significations. L'enseignement des Sages, si on approfondit, dérive toujours du sens littéral.
Quatrième critique : Enseignements mensongers à propos de Dieu: cas des anthropomorphismes.
Réponse: la sagesse cachée des midrachim requiert les bonnes clés de lecture. Il faut s'interroger sur le sens réel des anthropomorphismes
Exemples : dans Berakhot 7a Dieu prie, il demande à un prêtre entré dans le Saint des Saints de le bénir; dans Berakhot 6a Dieu” met des tefilines”, ... Dieu qui est le Bien absolu aurait-il besoin de prier? Il le fait dans le cadre de sa relation dialogale à l'homme, l'interpellant, appelant en retour la prière de l'homme. L'enseignement est que Dieu a besoin de l'homme pour accomplir son vouloir, le donneur doit nécessairement associer à son action le récepteur.
Quant à la forme de l'expression, le Maharal, relisant les Sages se place du côté de l'homme, c'est nous qui percevons Dieu ainsi.

Cinquième critique : Enseignements futiles et inconsistants, légendes mensongères.
Réponse: Il ne sied pas au Sage qui comprend la vérité de considérer avec animosité les propos de son adversaire. Les Sages doivent prendre les mêmes précautions que les prophètes: distance, images, paraboles car la connaissance des choses divines ne peut être révélée à tous. Ils s'expriment dans un langage voilé nécessitant des commentaires explicatifs. Image des pommes d'or enveloppées d'un réticule d'argent. Certains enseignements, par exemple l'oeuvre de la création מעשה בראשית , /ma'asseh berechit/ (Genèse 1 et 2), ne doivent pas être délivrés devant plus de deux personnes déjà avancées dans leurs études juives; quant à l'enseignement du “char divin”, מעשה מרכבה , /ma'asseh merkava/, (Ezéchiel 1), il ne peut l'être qu'à un seul étudiant, et seulement si le maître l'en juge digne.
Exemple : voici une histoire apparemment futile dans le Talmud de Babylone traité Baba Kama 104a: « Rabbah b. Bar Hana a ensuite affirmé : j’ai vu une grenouille aussi grande que le fort de Hagronia (Le fort de Hagronia est grand comme 60 maisons). Un serpent est venu et a avalé la grenouille. Un corbeau est venu et a avalé le serpent et s’est posé sur un arbre. Imaginez la force de cet arbre. R. Papa b. Samuel a dit : si je n’avais pas été là, je ne l’aurais pas cru. »
Chaque détail est signifiant. Les animaux sont associés à un élément: la grenouille à l'eau, le serpent au feu, le corbeau à l'air. Ces éléments selon la Torah régissent l'existence. Le nombre 60 exprime la multiplicité; l'arbre est image du monde, la racine cause première et les nombreuses branches qui jaillissent les unes des autres représentent l'enchaînement des causes. Cette histoire s'inscrit dans le cadre d'une polémique avec les hérétiques qui prétendent que les choses diverses ont pour cause différents agents. L'enseignement tend à montrer que l'univers est un tout relié par enchaînements en toutes ses parties et dont un seul artisan est la cause. Une référence à Job 14,4 rappelle que le pur comme l'impur sortent du Dieu unique. Mais si l'on n'est conscient ni du contexte polémique historique, ni de l'enjeu de la démonstration, ne reste qu'un récit parfaitement absurde.
Sixième critique: Les Sages d'Israël ne connaissent pas les sciences, en particulier l'astronomie et la physique et sont donc éloignés de la vérité.
Réponse: Les Sages centrent leur attention non sur les causes naturelles qui sont peu de chose mais sur la cause qui agit sur la nature.
Exemple: un autre passage nous introduit au mode de pensée et à la logique des Sages
15
:
«Malheur aux créatures, dit R.Yossi, qui voient mais ne savent ce qu'elles voient, qui sont debout, mais ne savent sur quoi elles le sont! La terre? Sur quoi repose-t-elle? Sur des piliers ainsi qu'il est dit (Job 9,6): il fait trembler la terre sur ces bases, et il ébranle les colonnes qui la supportent. Et les colonnes reposent sur l'eau, car il est dit (Ps 136, 6):il étendit la terre par-dessus les eaux;et les eaux sont répandues sur les montagnes car il est dit(Ps 104, 6): sur les montagnes les eaux s'étaient arrêtées. Les montagnes

sont posées sur le vent, car il est dit (Amos 4,13): car c'est Lui qui a formé les montagnes et créé le vent (Rachi: le voisinage de ces 2 notations indique que les montagnes reposent sur le vent). Le vent repose sur l'ouragan, car il est dit (Ps 148, 8): le vent de tempête exécute ses ordres. L'ouragan est suspendu au bras de Dieu, car il est dit (Dt 33, 27): tu as pour refuge le Dieu primordial, pour support ses bras éternels. Or les Sages disent: le monde repose sur 12 colonnes, car il est dit (Dt 32, 8): il fixa les limites des peuples, d'après le nombre des enfants d'Israël; certains disent que le monde repose sur 7 colonnes, car il est dit (Prov 9,1): la Sagesse a bâti sa maison, et elle en a sculpté les 7 colonnes. Rabbi Ele'azar ben Chamua a dit, quant à lui: le monde repose sur un unique pilier, qui a pour nom “le Juste”, car il est dit (Prov 10, 25) le Juste est le fondement du monde».
On s'interroge pour savoir sur quoi repose le monde. Différentes réponses, en référence aux Ecritures, sont proposées: douze, sept ou un piliers, qui eux-mêmes sont posés sur différents supports enchâssés les uns dans les autres: eaux, montagnes, vent,...
Bien sûr le texte est allégorique. Le monde ne peut se maintenir lui-même, il doit être maintenu par Dieu. Le Ps 115,16 exprime l'union de la terre et des hommes en tant qu'elle leur a été donnée, et les hommes sont appelés “colonnes” à cause de leur position verticale qui les différencie parmi les autres créatures et les situe à la ressemblance de Dieu, debout, en ce qu'il est au-dessus de tout et jamais ne se courbe devant personne. L'homme, à l'image de Dieu, gouverne.
Les colonnes posées sur l'eau représentent la catégorie d'hommes qui possèdent la Torah (appelée eau) Is 55,1 “Vous tous qui avez soif, venez à moi...” De même que l'eau coule d'un endroit élevé vers une altitude inférieure, de même les enseignements de la Torah ne subsistent que chez ceux dont la mentalité est humble (Ta'anit 5b).
L'eau repose sur les montagnes qui sont les Sages éminents (1 R 8, 2 le mois des eytanim, des Puissants)
Les montagnes reposent sur le vent , c'est le degré de l'Esprit Saint, union plus intime à Dieu.
Le vent repose sur l'ouragan, c'est la prophétie, l'Esprit Saint dans toute son impétuosité (Ez 37,1); l'ouragan est suspendu au bras de Dieu, c'est à dire à la force de Dieu
Douze colonnes comme les douze enfants de Jacob; sept comme les trois Patriarches et leurs quatre épouses;
le Juste, distingué par son union à Dieu.
Le Sage rattache la terre à Dieu par une série de degrés qui s'enchaînent, son parcours s'apparente à l'ascension du point le plus bas à l'union à Dieu qui permet le maintien des existants. Il accède progressivement aux secrets de la science cachée au commun des hommes.

Septième critique: Les Sages méprisent les ignorants et les non juifs.
Réponse: ce ne sont pas les personnes qui sont méprisées mais l'ignorance et l'hérésie. Cette critique porte sur la ברכת המנים /birkat-haminim/ la malédiction des hérétiques, introduite dans la prière quotidienne des dix-huit bénédictions שמונה עשרה /chemoneé esré/ à la fin du premier siècle.
En résumé, on peut dire avec le Maharal qu' Azaria dei Rossi et les tenants de sa position n'ont pas compris que le sens des midrachim est métaphysique et non physique et demande des clefs de lecture particulières, parmi lesquelles:
1. Ne pas lire le mot concrètement mais de manière conceptuelle, métaphysique. 2. Là où le sens semble absurde, faire jouer l'intertextualité, chercher dans les autres textes de la Bible, du Talmud, du Zohar, des différents recueils de commentaires, des occurences qui s'éclairent mutuellement. 3. Ne pas se contenter de chercher la cause naturelle d'un évènement mais la cause de la cause, c'est à dire toujours se demander quel enseignement est à tirer d'un évènement. 4. Dieu se révèle et ce faisant se donne, נותן /noten/; mais la perception du don par celui qui reçoit, מקבל /meqabel/, peut présenter un grand écart. L'homme perçoit selon sa capacité d'accueil.
Il est temps d'expliciter le titre de cet ouvrage, sciemment choisi par le Maharal, באר הגולה /Beer hagolah/ Le Puits de l'Exil. Il faut, bien sûr, y lire une allusion à Gn 26, 12-33 où l'on voit Isaac en butte à des contestataires concernant les 7 puits qu'il a creusés près de Beer Cheva, littéralement le puits du serment. Le puits évoque dans la littérature midrachique la Torah, source pure à laquelle le Juif en exil puise force et réconfort. Les enseignements des Sages sont ce puits de l'exil, succédant à la prophétie biblique. Le mot /beer/ “puits” a comme homonyme le verbe expliquer. La Torah Orale qui explique la Torah Ecrite est la condition de survie de l'existence et de l'identité juives. Le commentaire du Maharal vise à déboucher le puits afin de lui permettre de continuer à abreuver son peuple, gage de la Présence de Dieu à ses côtés, comme au désert.
Toute la méditation du Maharal est nourrie de cet enseignement traditionnel et il est intéressant de suivre son cheminement pour le comprendre dans sa grande oeuvre, composée de six livres. Les titres choisis sont en soi révélateurs de sa méthode, en tout point fidèle à celle de ses Maîtres, les Sages d'Israël. Ils reprennent les qualificatifs attribués à l'Eternel dans un verset biblique ''A toi, Eternel, la grandeur, la force et la magnificence, l'éternité et la gloire, car tout ce qui est au ciel et sur la terre t'appartient, à toi, Eternel, le règne, car tu t'élèves souverainement au-dessus de tout!'' (1 Chroniques 29,11).

I ספר הגדולה /Sefer ha-Gedoulah/, Le Livre de la Grandeur, se rapporte à la Création et au Chabbat.
II ספר הגבורה /Sefer ha-Gevourah/, Les Hauts Faits de l'Eternel commente la sortie d'Egypte et la fête de Pessah *

III ספר תפרת ישראל /Sefer Tiferet-Israël/, Le Livre de la Gloire d'Israël, éclaire la Révélation de la Torah et la fête de Chavouot *
IV ספר נצח ישראל /Sefer Netsah-Israël/, Le Livre de l'Eternité d'Israël explore la fête du 9 Av, thème de l'Exil et de la Rédemption, du rapport d'Israël et des nations *
V ספר ההוד /Sefer ha-Hod/, Le Livre de la Louange célèbre la fête de Soukkot caractérisée par des louanges et des actions de grâce.
VI ספר שמים וארץ /Sefer Shamayim Vaarets/, Le Livre des Cieux et de la Terre se rapporte aux fêtes de Roch ha-Chanah et de Yom Kippour.
Ces six oeuvres sont vraisemblablement écrites entre 1578 et 1600 et suivent le calendrier liturgique. On est frappé par la tonalité mystique des mots clés des titres qui renvoient à diverses ספירות /sefirot
17
/ qui dans la cabale désignent les 10 émanations à travers lesquelles se manifeste la divinité et ses puissances.
Trois de ces six oeuvres sont aujourd'hui connues (*). Le Maharal fut l'un des premiers à expliquer l'unité du cycle des fêtes juives qui se complètent les unes les autres pour reproduire la structure et l'articulation de la constitution de l'Alliance, trame de la destinée du peuple juif. Ces fêtes rappellent les moments forts de la rencontre avec le Dieu transcendant et réactivent cette expérience de proximité à l'origine de la naissance et du développement du peuple juif.
Ce verset de 1 Ch 29, 11, dont s'inspire le Maharal pour les titres de ces six ouvrages, est connu de la tradition car il fut intégré dans la prière quotidienne et fut aussi commenté par les Sages. Par exemple, Rabbi Aqiba
18
fait correspondre à chaque qualificatif de l'Eternel un épisode ou un symbole de l'histoire juive. Ainsi le mot גדולה ''grandeur'' est lu comme évoquant l'ouverture de la Mer Rouge, le mot גבורה ''puissance'' évoque la mort des premiers nés, le mot תפארת ''magnificence'' la Révélation, בשמים ובארץ ''au

Les astérix (*) indiquent les œuvres du Maharal qui nous sont parvenues.

Les dix sefirot représentent des qualités ou agents, puissances de l'émanation divine qui rendent perceptibles dans le monde fini la lumière de Dieu אין סופ /en sof/, sans limite ou infini. Elles permettent le passage entre deux mondes radicalement étrangers l'un à l'autre, le monde divin transcendant et le monde créé immanent, dans une atténuation, déperdition de la lumière divine originelle, à travers dix degrés (autre traduction possible du mot sefirot), nombres primordiaux à comprendre comme des principes métaphysiques ou des entités (souffle de Dieu, air, eau, feu et les six directions de l'espace). Le mot sefira apparaît pour la première fois dans le ספר יצירה /sefer yetsira/, Le Livre de la Formation, ouvrage que la tradition fait remonter au IVème ou Vème siècles et qui raconte la création du monde au moyen des 22 lettres de l'alphabet hébreu et de l'arbre cabalistique qui donne l'ordonnancement des dix sefirot. Ces dix sefirot forment avec les vingt-deux lettres de l'alphabet hébreu les trente-deux sentiers de la Sagesse décrits dans Le Livre de la Formation.
Les sefirot peuvent donc être définies comme l'espace de la manifestation divine.
18
Rabbi Aqiba vécut au IIème siècle de notre ère et fut mis à mort par les Romains pour ne pas avoir respecté l'interdiction de ne plus étudier la Torah. C'est un des plus grands Maîtres parmi les Sages d'Israël.

ciel et sur la terre'' le projet créateur. Tous les commentaires voient dans ''la puissance de Dieu'' la sortie d'Egypte.
Le Maharal commença par écrire la deuxième oeuvre de son programme, Les Hauts faits de l'Eternel, qui porte précisément sur la sortie d'Egypte, événement fondateur du judaïsme.
Comme les Sages d'Israël, c'est en se référant à l'Ecriture qu'il commente les textes. Tout part et tout revient à l'Ecriture. Comme les Sages et avec eux, il interroge le texte verset par verset. Il commence toujours par se référer à une aggadah talmudique ou à un midrach. Il met ses pas dans ceux des Sages, emprunte leur propre chemin afin de mettre à jour la valeur métaphysique de leurs paroles et enseignements.
La forme de cet enseignement est incontournable et nous conduit à mettre en perspective recherche profane et recherche de la Tradition révélée et leurs méthodes. Le Maharal ne rejette ni l'une ni l'autre, il nous livre ses réflexions sur חכמה /hokhmah/ et תורה /torah/ dans le cinquième chapitre du Puits de l'exil.
Sagesse grecque et sagesse hébraïque
C'est pour lui l'occasion de faire le point sur la vision juive qui oppose sagesse grecque et sagesse hébraïque. La civilisation grecque est proche de la pensée biblique en ce sens qu'elle tente d'expliquer l'homme et le monde dans lequel il vit. Mais entre Athènes et Jérusalem existe une opposition irréductible qui provoque l'affrontement des deux pensées. Dans le vocabulaire hébreu, c'est le mot חכמה /hokhmah/ qui renvoie au mode de connaissance du réel développé en Grèce par l'utilisation de la raison naturelle. Cette recherche est limitée à la structure du donné. Elle permet d'en rendre compte, de l'organiser, non de le dépasser.
La sagesse d'Israël, elle, est appelée תורה /torah/. Elle résiste à se fondre dans cette phénoménalité. Héritière de la Révélation, d'une expérience prophétique transcrite dans le texte de la Torah, reçue et transmise depuis Moïse, elle développe une pensée transcendant le donné. L'homme biblique vit dans l'intimité d'une Présence et son identité est ancrée dans une relation d'Alliance. La Torah a un contenu métaphysique, méta-historique. Au regard des Sages d'Israël, les deux options, grecque et hébraïque, vont s'affronter, devenir divergentes et incompatibles. La sagesse grecque s'appuie sur des hypothèses et des expériences toujours issues du réel. La sagesse d'Israël s'appuie sur la transmission de thèmes révélés, ouverture sur le monde qui advient et dont le terme n'est pas donné, tendant vers l'infini.
Si du point de vue juif, la hokhmah est comme une échelle qui permet d'accéder à un premier niveau de connaissance inclus dans la sagesse de la Torah, la sagesse grecque elle, ne peut accepter la démarche de la sagesse juive car son horizon se limite au cosmos, au monde donné, il n'existe pour elle aucun élément extérieur. Elle prétend à une connaissance absolue. La vérité est la représentation fidèle du monde qui doit seule diriger le jugement et la conduite. Le Maharal discerne dans ces présupposés une volonté de puissance qui nie toute altérité et refuse d'autres modes d'intelligibilité. La pensée s'identifie à l'être et le réel n'est rien d'autre que ce que l'homme peut penser et expliquer rationnellement. Le midrash s'inscrit dans la continuité du mode d'expression de la Torah et poursuit d'une manière novatrice la Révélation; il est la figure que prend la hokhmah à travers l'histoire et le trésor de la pensée juive.

Le Maharal écrivit encore d'autres livres, l'un consacré à la fête de Pourim, אור חדש /or 'hadach/ Une Lumière Nouvelle, l'autre à celle de Hanoucca, נר מצוה /ner mitsvah/ Le Chandelier du Commandement. Ces deux fêtes, contrairement aux autres, sont plus tardives et ne se fondent pas sur les textes du Peutateuque.
Certains commentaires s'apparentent à des traités de morale et de spiritualité: דרך חיים /derekh 'hayyim/, Le Chemin de la Vie (commentaire des Maximes des Pères /pirké avot/) et נתיבות עולם /netivot olam/, Les Sentiers du Monde.
Le Maharal fit aussi un livre sur les commentaires de Rachi גור אריה /Gur Arieh/.
Si l'on considère l'ensemble de ces livres, on constate qu'ils sont le fruit de dizaines d'années d'enseignements, de sermons, de méditations personnelles du texte saint et de questions qu'il eut à résoudre dans son ministère de rabbin.
L'oeuvre du Maharal resta inachevée. Manuscrits perdus dans l'incendie de sa maison ou arrêt délibéré, suite à la découverte du profond renouvellement qu'introduisit la kabbale lourianique dans les dernières années de sa vie? Le Maharal mûrissait-il une oeuvre nouvelle qu'il n'a pas eu le temps d'écrire? C'est la thèse d'André Neher.
Les études maharaliennes furent créées en France en 1969 par les deux disciples d'André Neher, Théodore Dreyfus et Benjamin Gross.
Le Maharal de Prague, aujourd'hui encore et plus que jamais figure majeure de la pensée juive et de la pensée universelle. Il ne sépara jamais sa recherche intellectuelle, son parcours existentiel et la questionnement profond sur la destinée du peuple juif. Avec honnêteté et lucidité, il ne cessa de se confronter aux paradoxes extrêmes de l'histoire d'Israël dans le monde. Que pouvait signifier la survivance de l'identité juive quand Israël eut perdu sa terre, sa nation, son roi ? Quand Israël ne connut plus d'autre condition que celle de l'exil, des persécutions, de l'humiliation ? Pourtant, force était de constater la vie intense, le dynamisme qui animaient les diverses communautés juives dans le monde. Selon les lieux et les époques, ce dynamisme fut plutôt commercial ou intellectuel. Le Maharal eut cette intuition et l'audace de penser la figure de l'Exil comme constructive ; désormais le peuple d'Israël avait un rôle à jouer dans le concert des nations où il vivait. Les expulsions d'Espagne, puis du Portugal, en 1492 et 1498, restent des dates marquantes, ou plutôt traumatisantes dans l'histoire juive. Elles font tomber le voile de l'illusion d'une intégration acceptée sereinement par les nations. L'évolution parallèle des nations occidentales ouvre, dans le même temps une brèche pour s'interroger sur la place de l'Autre, de celui qui appartient à une culture ou une religion différente. Le grand chantier de la modernité est en marche.
Le Maharal, se tient, majestueux, dans sa haute stature, à l'aube de ce temps qu'il pense nouveau et plein de promesses. L'Histoire répondra aux générations qui lui succéderont, parfois positivement, par exemple quand à la suite de la Révolution Française, les Juifs français puis d'autres nations obtiendront peu à peu l'égalité des droits civiques, parfois tragiquement comme à l'époque du nazisme.
Oui, les sociétés évoluent lentement, mais trop lentement, vers un meilleur « Vivre Ensemble ». Des rencontres, des relations nouvelles s'observent entre Juifs et Chrétiens, alors même que les arrière-gardes

continuent de ne transmettre que les clichés éculés du mépris, de la haine, prêchant une séparation totale des communautés, assoiffées d'une illusoire et dangereuse pureté.

MIRABILE, Françoise: Revival of Jewish Thought in the 16th Century by the Maharal of Prague or the Search for the 'Middle Dimension' between Revelation and Science
The author explores the theological and scientific research of the colossal seventeenth century Jewish figure the Maharal of Prague, or Rabbi Juda Loëb, who revolutionized his epoch by reconciling and consolidating 1,500 years of Jewish religious thought and of the European scientific advances of his time in an attempt to construct a philosophy of man's dynamic collaboration in God's Creation.
The fact that his numerous writings had been either partially forgotten or transformed into legends of a rather unearthly, supernatural nature testifies to the importance of his work and their radically novel demands upon both the Jewish and Christian communities of his day. Was he really the Rabbi who created the terrible Golem, who as long as he bore on his forehead the three Hebrew letters which spelt 'truth', aided the Jews of the Prague ghetto, but when the Rabbi removed one of the letters during Shabbath, transforming the 'truth' into 'death', the Golem broke from its master's control, went haywire and destroyed the ghetto?..
Could the Maharal also be the prototype of Goethe's Doctor Faust, he who appropriated God's luminous divinity in order to be the sole provider of the world, powerful and solitary, having learnt his tremendous knowledge from no Rabbi, master of his Self, eternal and self-sufficient?

Indeed these legends contain great interest in themselves, yet they do not expose the theological rationalist as recorded in his enlightening analyses of the Torah, his insight of the exact sciences, especially astronomy in conjunction with the First Testament writings, and his intellectual and political contacts with the Emperor Rudolf the Second.
Talmudist and Kabbalist, the Maharal of Prague is the warden of Jewish Tradition; namely, that guardian who combats the throes of obscurantism by casting light upon the sacred texts and by the examination and scrutiny of the exact sciences and the Humanities. His method is rational, one that had been inaugurated by Maimonides during the Middle Ages. A universal method by which the Truth of the Revelation can be confirmed rationally, a method that the Rabbi coined the 'middle dimension'.
The method of the 'middle dimension' aims to reconcile and harmonize the inherent opposing forces or tendencies of Creation. To reconcile and harmonize the ontological vertical divinity and the existential transversal of the worldly, inspired through the readings and penetrations of the Torah and of its daily commerce with human nature, expresses precisely the wide-ranging purport of the Rabbi's tremendous intuitive erudition.
For the Maharal, the fundamental opposing forces of God's Creation are in fact the very organizing forces of our world, and for this reason are essentially necessary to man's quest for Truth. Similarly, his teachings, wrought from his profound interpretations of the Torah, as well as of the Midrashim, Targoum and other Rabbinic Traditional literature, had become a guide for Jewish communities; they pointed the way to the Jew's historical responsibility and mission in the world. These teachings were not always followed and were even stigmatized as diabolical. It was only in the early 1900's that his writings and teachings, read in an utterly new light, were resuscitated and restored to their proper guiding mission.
The author finishes her article by investigating the Maharal's reflexions on the opposing forces of Greek and Jewish wisdom, the first drawn from hypotheses and experiences in harmony with the realities of the world, the second drawn from the Revelation of the Torah, and its infinite and multiple interpretations of our world. Wisdoms which diverge essentially, thus essentially incompatible. What is perfectly compatible, however, is that the Maharal's writings and teachings open the way for a Jewish, Christian and Muslim inter-religious dialogue which seeks a long-lasting peace based on the mutual and active acceptation of each other's mutual and active participation in God's Creation.
One God shared by three communities...

The Gaya Scienza of Friedrich Nietzsche and The Art of Exposure
"[...]Von allen guten Dingen, die ich gefunden habe, will ich am wenigsten die „Fröhlichkeit des Erkennens“ wegwerfen oder verloren haben, wie Du vielleicht angefangen hast zu argwöhnen. Nur muß ich jetzt, mit meinem Sohne Zarathustra zusammen, zu einer viel höheren Fröhlichkeit hinauf, als ich sie je bisher in Worten darstellen konnte. Das Glück, welches ich in der „fröhlichen Wissenschaft“ darstellte, ist wesentlich das Glück eines Menschen, der sich endlich reif zu fühlen beginnt für eine ganz große Aufgabe, und dem die Zweifel über sein Recht dazu zu schwinden anfangen."

Friedrich Nietzsche was a goldsmith of words, a Goldschmiedekunst! A true philologist whose labouring of words expanded language by multiplying the discourses of which all languages consist. A labour of love of an experimental nature -versuch-, in which rime, epigrammatic versets, maxims, blank verse, alliteration and poetic prose develop and make evolve complex thought patterns. Polyphonic in Form and Substance, Nietzsche's discursive approach to knowledge through poetry and rhythmic prose was his 'science'. A science that spoke not in technical jargon or suffocating statistics; his science sought to close the naïve, dichotomic gap between prose and poetry, Science and Art, empiricism and positivism, Will and Intellect, induction and deduction, Subject and Object and perhaps, more importantly, Being and Becoming...
Nietzsche's writings paved his Way to the meaning of truth, by means of a joyful Art which emblemized truth, for truth is gleaned by the paver's empathy with his Self as both the subject and object of that truth...
1 Dated December 8th 1883. All citations of Nietzsche have been quoted from Digitale Kritische Gesamtausgabe (eKGWB). 'Of all the good things that I have discovered, it is the 'gaiety of knowledge' which I cherish the most, contrary to what you may suspect of me. With my son Zarathustra, I have now only to rise towards a gaity even higher than all that I have been able to express in words up till now. The happiness that I have represented in the Joyous Science is essentially one of a man who begins to feel mature for a great task and who no longer doubts his right to achieve it.' (Our translation).

For Nietzsche, Philology is a science that encompasses Art, History and Philosophy. The text, a pretext for the philologist to experiment philosophy, Art and History, the context of his Science, namely, the long study and teaching of philology as practised in the German academic world of the XIXth century, which led him to experiment and slowly unfold his Science of Language. And so when he retired from his university at Basel after ten years of professorship (1869-1879), abridging very early his career as an academic scholar, F. Nietzsche took to the road, erring from one town to another, from one European country to another.3 This does not imply that the young professor of philology (he had begun his career at the age of 24 ) became a wandering poet, philosopher or artist; it implies that Nietzsche transformed a static, passive reading into one of movement, of dialogue; transmuted a stagnant, torpid science into one of rhythm, of Becoming...It became his gaya scienza! The ambulant Way of Life; that is, an experimental adventure of him who 'strikes out on his own', who ventures forth Outside, and in doing so snaps the chains of mawkish, joyless Habitude. Nietzsche exposed himself entirely to the circumstances of the Outside world, quite alien to him; a self-exile from the self-satisfied and secure bookish assurance that produces and breeds arrogance, cynicism, vanity...
The wanderer is he who exposes himself to great risks and dangers: a self-banishment from the community, from the security of the known world. Nietzsche's exposure to the Unknown founded a work that would have never matured if he had remained a professor of philology at the University. For he left his family, his university, his country,4 and at 56 years of age, his own Self...Exposure to the Unknown was of his own will. A desire to be exposed and thus receptive to those alien sensory forms that burst in, upon and around him, which transformed yellowing pages into poetry, pulpit lessons into mountain stride and song, professorial prigishness into arrows of cheer and gaiety. The desire to lead a nomad life, receptive to the bursting matter around him, defines Nietzsche's long years of solitary travelling, his urgent need to transfer a philosophy of the past into a Philology of the Future. Exposed to this bursting alien matter the wanderer absorbed, assimilated and transmitted all that struck him, gleaning affects so as to attain their cause or causes, so as to transform them, alchemically, into 'Acts of Creation'! We call the gaya scienza that Art of Exposure as a method of Existence. An Art that Nietzsche cultivated with loving care in the new soils of the Philology of the Future...
The Art of Exposure. Philosophy practised, experienced...suffered. Art touched, cultivated...suffered. Poetry composed, read...suffered...
Nietzsche offered philology a new-found status: a compassionate philosopher, artist and poet, a word-lover whose act of writing resounded with cheerful seriousness. Writing became the result of wandering. Walking, striding, leaping became a Philosophy and Art.
F. Nietzsche was by no means a mediaevalist. However, as practitioner of the 'Connoisseurship of Words', a Kennerschaft des Wortes, he fully realized that the mediaeval troubadour, too, had led a life of erring, of composing songs and poems whilst on the road; led an exposed, receptive life to all alien matter which motivated him from the Outside...the Unknown, which set in motion his artistic energies,
3 This errant existence led him from the Black Forest region to Bayreuth, Lucerne, Lugane, Bex, Basel, Zürich, Sils-Maria, Genoa, Sicily, Venice, Rapallo, Naumburg, Nice, Stressa, Sorrento and Torino.
4 It may be reminded that Nietzsche renounced his Prussian citizenship in 1869 when applying for Swiss citizenship. He was refused and thus lived for the rest of his life without Statehood: Heimatlos!

or perhaps better put, his 'artistic will' his Kunst Wollen! In order to create, both Nietzsche and the mediaeval troubadour had to learn to 'live dangerously' on this road...
The Troubadour
"So wenig als möglich sitzen; keinem Gedanken Glauben schenken, der nicht im Freien geboren ist und bei freier Bewegung, — in dem nicht auch die Muskeln ein Fest feiern." 5
Ecce Homo
It is in Die Fröhliche Wissenschaft: la Gaya Scienza that F. Nietzsche renders homage to the mediaeval troubadours of Provence in Southern France. There where the sun shines white white mediterranean rays, where the skies glow a watery blue, the air dry, breezy...healthy, clean, the people light -hearted and gay. The Lust for the Outdoors is a sentiment that Nietzsche exalted; one that made him aware that his health depended upon it, a wanderlust intimately linked to Southern European cultures, especially Italian and Provençal that would conduct him to the summits of poetic prose. Creation depended on climatological conditions:
"[...] Paris, die Provence, Florenz, Jerusalem, Athen — diese Namen beweisen Etwas: das Genie ist bedingt durch trockne Luft, durch reinen Himmel, — das heisst durch rapiden Stoffwechsel, durch die Möglichkeit, grosse, selbst ungeheure Mengen Kraft sich immer wieder zuzuführen." 6
It was in the Provence, roughly between the XII° and the XIII° centuries, that an extraordinary culture developed with its own language, provençal, and literature, the gaia scienza or the gai saber! Troubadours of Italian, Occitan, Catalan, and Anadalucian descent composed and sang ballads and odes, fashioned a poetic koine of their own which extended throughout Southern Europe. Guillaume the Tenth, the initiator and mentor of the gaia scienza, along with Ebles the Second, Bernand de Ventador, Guirant Riquier and Lefranc Cigala, vehiculed this Occitan culture from castle to castle. They lived the adventures of men drunk with the Love of Language, of which their poems and songs were the joyful result. The sung poem reflected their way of life, their Experience of erring and composing, a Luftmensch existence that exposed them ultimately to the Unknown. For like F. Nietzsche, the Occitan troubadour obeyed no authority, refused to prostern before formality and conformity. The troubadour was the 'free spirit' revolting against politically tainted ecclesiastical dogma of the Catholic Church7, against the constraints of an artificial language, Latin, and its greco-romain metrical tradition. The troubadour was
5 "Sit as little as possible; credit no thought not born in the open air and whilst moving freely about- in which the muscles too do not hold a festival.' (Warum ich so klug bin: 2).
6 "Paris, Provence, Florence, Jerusalem, Athens- these names prove something: that genuis us conditioned by dry air, clear skythat is to say by rapid metabolism, by the possibility of again and again supplying oneself with great, even tremendous quantities of energy." (Ecce Homo: Warum ich so klug bin: 2).
7 Which earned them the infamous appelation chismatie (schismatic) in Occitan.

he who knew only the constraints that he himself imposed, be they poetic, political or social: the love of a married woman of aristocratic descent, whose illicitness tore asunder his heart and spirit and provoked moments of inner trials or turmoil which inspired many a troubadour in his poetic creation!
Did F. Nietzsche, once freed from the fetters of stoic fatuity, identify himself with the Occitan troubadour? Not only did he compose an eleven-strophe poem to the troubadour's gaia scienza; an den Mistral: Ein Tanzlied in which troubadours and free spirits dance merrily, but also affirmed his intimate link with this Provençal culture when he wrote in Ecce Homo:
" — Die Lieder des Prinzen Vogelfrei, zum besten Theil in Sicilien gedichtet, erinnern ganz ausdrücklich an den provençalischen Begriff der „gaya scienza“, an jene Einheit von Sänger, Ritter und Freigeist, mit der sich jene wunderbare Frühkultur der Provençalen gegen alle zweideutigen Culturen abhebt; das allerletzte Gedicht zumal, „an den Mistral“, ein ausgelassenes Tanzlied, in dem, mit Verlaub! über die Moral hinweggetanzt wird, ist ein vollkommner Provençalismus. — " 8
The minstrel, chivalrous knight and free spirit are joined in a triadic unity of great poetic importance; they bespeak Nietzsche's ontological make-up, the potential of what he was gradually 'becoming'...He wrote to Franz Overbeck: "[...] Das Clima des littoral provençal gehört auf das Wunderbarste zu meiner Natur; ich hätte den Schlußreim zu meinem Zarathustra nur an dieser Küste dichten können, in der Heimat der „gaya scienza.“."9
And in another letter to his friend Erwin Rodhe, F. Nietzsche states: "[...] Was den Titel 'fröhliche Wissenschaft' betrifft, so habe ich nur an die gaya scienza der Troubadours gedacht- daher auch sie Verschen."10
Thus on the soil of the 'gaya scienza' Nietzsche expended his artistic energy, combining a cheery disposition and combative spirit in order to overcome the obstacles to knowledge...his Becoming. A merry warrior constantly exposed to the Outside, who waged war in the realms of the Unknown, who identified himself completely to the knight-errant, not in any sensu allegorico, but as we see it, in sensu proprio! To be the poet of one's life, of living dangerously: the quest of the Other...A mediaeval spirit indeed of Southern climes...
The Leap outwards is regarded as the sole means of moulding ideas into philosophical Figures, shaping matter into Form, words into Poetry. For the Unknown is formless, shapeless; it is chaos: a
8 "The songs of Prince Vogelfrei were composed mainly in Sicily; they are highly reminiscent of the Provençal idea of gaya scienza, of that union of singer, knight and free sprit, which distinguishes itself from all doubtful cultures; notably the very las t poem, the Minstrel, an exuberant dance song in which, pardon my saying so, one dances beyond moral, is a perfect Provençalism." (Ecce Homo: gaya scienza . Our translation).
9 "[...]The climate of the littoral provençal suits my nature mervellously; I would not have been able to write the final rime of my Zarathustra anywhere else than on this coast in the homeland of the 'gaya scienza'." (7th of April, 1884: our translation).
10 Letter dated 1882/83. "As for the title Gay Science, I thought only of the gaya scienza of the troubadours- hence also the little verses." (Translation Walter Kaufmann: Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist, Princeton 1974, page 6, note.

succession of moments, a juxtaposition of lieux. The harbingers of the gay science sought to transmute the whirling, chaotic matter into Form, whatever the cost to one's exposed self.
The result of this Leap is creation! In other words, the transmutation of the Unknown into the known. An alchemist's experiment which entails the experimentor's desire to be the object of his experiment. It is the ontological make-up of the poet-alchemist that combines, transfuses and assimilates with and into his creation. An analogical coalescence which melds ontic will and desire into forms.
So from out the depths of Chaos the poet composes his Art. However, this laboured extraction requires delivrance: again the poet must expose himself to another Unknown...the public; that is, to the reception of his creation. Double exposure: the first to Chaos as the means of creation (Being), the second to a public as the means of and to Existence! The poet can only 'be' if his poetry 'exists', and this existence depends upon the 'regard' of his creation by others...
The wandering poet is ever astir, ever vigilant and receptive to those sparks that kindle the creative passion; sparks bursting in from the silence of solitude. We call these sparks 'colpes de joi',11 'blows of inspiration' because they 'strike joy' to him who is thoroughly prepared to glean and cultivate them, hard enough to receive the blows (colpes) because only strength of character will transmute potentially lethal blows into ones of joy (joi); a joy stemming from the strength that one feels welling within, ready to burst out and engender Acts of creation. The 'colpes de joi' nourish the gai saber, limit its Form, define its raison d'être. We may say that 'colpes de joi' symbolise vital forces from without, out of which Die Fröhliche Wissenshaft and Also Sprach Zarathustra were hammered: 'blows of joy' repeated again and again until the opus emerges, ever forward in the Act of creation; the opus as one's Self! To be a poet or architect of one's life is the branded seal that Die Fröhliche Wissenschaft and Also Sprach Zarathustra bear. A joyous creation of Art...of exihilarate generosity...
The Gay Science
"[...], man schreibt nur im Angesichte der Poesie gute Prosa!" 12
"Dasselbe gilt noch einmal und im höchsten Grade von der gaya scienza: fast in jedem Satz derselben halten sich Tiefsinn und Muthwillen zärtlich an der Hand. Ein Vers, welcher die Dankbarkeit für den wunderbarsten Monat Januar ausdrückt, den ich erlebt habe — das ganze Buch ist sein Geschenk — verräth zur Genüge, aus welcher Tiefe heraus hier die „Wissenschaft“ fröhlich geworden ist:"13
11 See Le Gai Savoir dans la Rhétorique courtoise, Dragonetti, Roger, ed. Seuil, Paris 1982, especially page 52.
12 "Good prose is written only face to face with poetry" (The Gay Science: 92, R. J. Hollingdale).
13 Ecce Homo: Die Fröhliche Wissenschaft: 'gaya scienza' "The Gay Science is a gift to humanity: in practically every sentence of this book profundity and exuberance go hand and hand. A poem which expresses gratitude for the most wonderful month of Janurary I have ever experienced- the entire book is a gift-betrays out of what a depth 'science' has here become gay:'' (Ecce Homo: la 'gaya scienza' R.J. Hollingdale).

An extraordinary six-year labour to ally and compound contraries. A cheerful hybrid because a playful, triumphant one. In this book Power and Joy are in no way antagonistic: they are the true allies of F. Nietzsche.
The work comprises rimes, songs, poems, maxims and aphorisms of varying lengths. A work cultivated under Italian skies, for the German troubadour wrote for free spirits (Freigeist), for untrammeled adventurers who had taken the Leap outwards, tasting thus the bitter-sweet Unknown, who had discovered (trobar) that the Art of Poetry and that of Science are indeed allies!
Save Also Sprach Zarathustra, never has a work elucidated the inmost intricacies between Philosophy and Art. It is this dual intricacy that adumbrates Nietzsche's solitary wanderings and dialogues with the troubadour culture. The book opens with rimes and closes with songs. In between, Philosophy and Art commingle nicely, converge and diverge in an breezy, fluid style of writing. The 383 rubrics organize meaning in a parataxic fashion; each rubric-thought, although monadic in nature, errs from one theme to another in a jocular, analogical ply. Nietzsche's Art of reasoning does not follow a thesis-antithesissynthesis pattern or method, nor does it reach conclusions by dialectics; his Art of reasoning is analogical perspectivism; that is, a circularity of thoughts that falls back (züruck) on itself sequencially, driving ever outwards and inwards, composing a configuration of centripetal and centrifugal spirals, expressing a myriad points of view, spiralling outwards and inwards whose technique is the use of analepse and prolepse. Analepse and prolepse are the result of Nietzsche's Exposure. For example, in the Gay Science the Will to Power is in germ and alluded to, but blossoms forth in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, some of whose sections, however, are declaimed in the Gay Science. The Eternel Recurrence, too, is touched upon and worked out in the Gay Science, but polished to a diamond sheen in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. We must go back even further to Daybreak, published in 1881, in order to gauge Nietzsche's aphoristic experimentation as a means of creating philosophical Figures. Although the Will to Power is not explicitly mentioned, aphorisms such as 'Subtlety of the feeling of power' (245), 'Praise and Blame' (140), 'Feeling of power' (348) and 'Effect of happiness' (356) do allude to a Figure in gestation. Many aphorisms, too, swelling in cheer and joy, announce the explosions of gaiety to come, as if the gaya scienza, as a Method of Existence, had definitely taken root into the very Soil of Being! It may also be reminded that Daybreak and the Gay Science overlap textually because many sections were composed for either the one or the other. In Ecce Homo, Nietzsche returns to the past, so to speak to review his books in his present state of mind, completing thus a spiral which ingeniously merges past and present. The spiral technique of the Gay Science eschews, even defies any chronological or eschatological method of analyse! It may be Nietzsche's most personal work.
Nietzsche's very personal work in the Joyeuse Science records his gaity, for it links expression and meaning. This he does in all seriousness because according to him, seriousness and gaity form a harmonious poetic unity. And for this reason Die Fröhliche Wissenschaft, although philosophically and poetically dense, flows along swiftly. Oftentimes it re-echoes the troubadours' musical verses: a perpetual game of hide and seek, arcane meanings, puns, antithesis, idioms and double-entente...
As we mentioned above, Nietzsche opens his Gay Science with 63 rhymes which he intitles Jokes, Cunning and Revenge. It is the word 'cunning' (List) that interests us here. Cunning supposes both slyness and craftiness...craftiness implies skill. Indeed, Nietzsche's Art of writing, often deemed ambiguous, reflects a philologist's unorthodox manner in dealing with philosophical questions:

metaphor, parody and allegory supplant systematic analysis or cold, abstract reasoning. However, this so-called ambiguity has nothing to do with hoodwinking readers or purposely beguiling them. Neither does Nietzsche's 'method' insinuate that his works are hopelessly contradictory because riddled with paronomastic fıgures. If and when contradictions arise, this is due to the way in which readers 'read' or pretend to read his books. Nietzsche obliges us not only to ponder a problem, but also to weigh up the manner in which the problem has been expressively posited. And this is his cunning! He reveals how the meaning of a problem can be 'felt' (as he had felt it); how the reader can be 'struck' (as he was struck). In a word, the signifier exposes the signified...This is Nietzsche's craftmanship, his gaya scienza. It is thus a question of 'style'. A philosophical style behind which lurks and ruminates the Love of Language...
The Provençal troubadours were men of style. They carved their style out of Chaos and elevated it to a Cult of Language. This Cult is called the gai saber! It did not laude God, albeit metaphors and simile abound of sainted flavour. Neither did it bare the identity of the poet's presumed lover (Amie). The troubadour, in reality had but one love: language. A discursive devotion which developed into a style of composing and executing that one may call tricky, sly or cunning because in an epoch in which ecclesiastical authority weilded terrible power the troubadour had to be an expert in the Art of allusion in order to subtlety side-step censorship or evade envious knights or noblemen. Many troubadours even sought to outwit the subtlety of their own cunning verses (chansons à gab), a play which requires a great deal of irony. For example, this strophe from Maurice de Craon:
"...si dirai bien comment Pluz sagement eschiver les en doie, Quar sens de ghille a ghiller ghille avoie Pluz qu'autre rienz, et tout par sa maistrie Est trahisons, trahir quidant, trahie."
(XIII° century)14
"...I shall say how One must avoid them wisely, for the wisdom of wile to beguile the wile More than anything else, and all by this mastery Is betrayal, who in thinking to betray is betrayed."15
To this strophe we can compare Nietzsche's own ironic verses:
"Gebt mir Leim nur: denn zum Leime Find'ich selber mir schon Holz! Sinn in vier unseinn'ge Reime Legen-ist kein kleiner Stolz!"
(Dichter-Eitelkeit)
14 Roger Dragonetti, loc. cit. page 35. Ghille ou guille in Old French meant 'deceit, farce, foolishness'.

Or these two strophes:
"Halb ist dein Leben um, Der Zeiger rückt, die Seele schaudert dir! Lang schweift sie schon herum Und sucht, und fand nicht- und sie saudert hier?
Halb ist dein Legen um: Schmerz war's und Irrtum Stund um Stund dahier! Was suchst du noch? Warum? Dies eben such'ich-Grund um Grund dafür!" (Der Skepiker spricht)16
It appears that de Craon and Nietzsche are attempting to outsmart themselves by witty verve of cognate forms, echolalia and nursery rime. Be that as it may, cunning here does not insinuate misleading readers or listeners; it signifies driving language to such limits of expression that the words themselves seem to clamour their own existence, a sort of Heideggarian die sprache spricht! One may well ask whether Nietzsche's and the troubadours' compositions might have been a mirror of themselves: the Other, both sacrificers of and sacrificing to Language. Akin to the medium of expression and the meaning itself, they become the consumers and the consumed of their own works. For ritualized play is what characterizes both Nietzsche's and the troubadours' gay science: rime play, alliterative couplets, iterate formulae and a smack of waggish delight will divert one's attention if he attempts to underestand words and phrasings at their face value. Poetic or aphoristic brevity misleads because it seeks not to resolve; it may indeed resolve, yet it does so by suggestive means! Many words contain two innate meanings. The quick or skimpy reader will invariably misunderstand or overlook many fine and crucial points which connote philosophical and ontological problems.
From this 'cunning' or 'playful' craftmanship arises parody, but not necessarily satirical. Zarathustra's 'coming down' from the mountain may appear humorous to some, but his mission is quite serious. Play does not signify 'nonsense' or 'insignificance'. Again, it is a question of Language as a medium of attaining the Other:
"Leg-ich mich aus, so leg'ich mich hinein: Ich kann nicht selbst mein Interprete sein. Doch wer nur steigt auf seiner eignen Bahn, Trägt auch mein Bild zu hellerm Licht hinan." (Interpretation)
One's Self as both the Way (Bahn) to the Poem and the Poem itself! Troubadours who sang poems inspired by an 'idealistic and distant love' 'par un amour idéal et lointain'17 were, like Nietzsche, reading

themselves into their compositions. Not exactly a love of oneself, but of Language as the integral part of one's Self. For example, these verses from Jaufré Rudel:
"Ben sai c'anc de lei no'm jauzi, Ni ja de mi no's jauzira, Ni per son amic no'm tnera Ni coven no'm fara de si; Anc no'm dis ver ni no'm menti Et no sai si ja s'o fara."18
"I know that never from her have I taken delight, Neither will she ever take delight from me, Neither a friend to me will ever she be Neither to a promise will she ever imply; Never does she tell me the truth or a lie And never do I know whether truth or lie she will decree."19
This type of dissimulation and ambiguity led many to accuse the troubadours of falsehood and lies. For example:
"Sevent si bien lor langage Et lor mos polir C'on ne set choisir Liquel ont loial corage."
(Gillebert de Berneville)20
"They know their tongue so well And their words refined That one knows not find Those in whose heart truths dwell."21
But troubadours do not lie! The poets wanted to surprise their public, to outplay the envious intelligence of those who, with keen ears, listened to discover the 'hidden messsage' behind such poetic games, to trobar a 'secret lover' or 'Amie'. But there is none...Fin' Amor lies not in the 'passage à l'acte', but rather in the eternal desire of the Language-Other, ungraspable, yet ubiquitous; here and now because an integral part of one's Self...

This inter-animation on the part of the troubadour and his public drove the poet to elaborate further, to plunge deeper into the Unknown so as to create a Poetry whose style of expression and execution would awe, fascinate, enthrall. F. Nietzsche, too, strove to fascinate his readers; a fascination that turned against him after his breakdown and death when Nazi officials extracted formulae and phrasings out of their context in order to crown their ideological opus. This enormous misinterpretation is partly due to Nietzsche's tropological and rhapsodical expression, albeit he did warn us:
"— Wenn diese Schrift irgend Jemandem unverständlich ist und schlecht zu Ohren geht, so liegt die Schuld, wie mich dünkt, nicht nothwendig an mir. Sie ist deutlich genug, vorausgesetzt, was ich voraussetze, dass man zuerst meine früheren Schriften gelesen und einige Mühe dabei nicht gespart hat: diese sind in der That nicht leicht zugänglich."22
Or again in Morgenröthe:
" — sie selbst wird nicht so leicht irgend womit fertig, sie lehrt gut lesen, das heisst langsam, tief, rück- und vorsichtig, mit Hintergedanken, mit offen gelassenen Thüren, mit zarten Fingern und Augen lesen... Meine geduldigen Freunde, dies Buch wünscht sich nur vollkommene Leser und Philologen: lernt mich gut lesen! —"23
This of course did not mean that Nietzsche expected his work to be transformed into some Nazi vademecum: it meant that the Philologist-Poet expected to be read with intelligence and without any arrière-pensée, and like the troubadours' public, seek out this 'hidden meaning' (the quest of truth and not an idea) which lay behind figures and turns of phrases. And what is that 'hidden meaning', that 'truth'? That the gaya scienza is the very means to and of Existence...to the Will to Be...
A troubadour Existence indeed, in Die Fröhliche Wissenschaft, Nietzsche lauds his merry predecessors as his Way of Existence: An den Mistral: Ein Tanzlied, Für Tänzer, Mit dem Fusse schreiben, Der Wanderer proclaim an immense joy: Mein Glück, An die Tugendsamen, An einen Lichtfreund, Im Sommer, Ecce Homo, Dichters Berufung. He praises Southern Europe in a six five-verse strophe poem: Im Süden. Although ill, Nietzsche was at the height of his poetic skills. A provocative Poetry but which rebutes polemics. Bombastic at times but never, like the troubadour Art can be, burlesque, obscene or ridiculous. 24 Nietzsche does, however, graze the delicate line between the 'serious' and the 'joke' (Scherz), an
22 On the Genealogy of Morals: 8: "If this book is incomprehensible to anyone and jars on his ears, the fault, it seems to me, is not necessarily mine. It is clear enough, assuming, as I do assume, that one has first read my earlier writings and has not spare d some trouble in doing so: for they are, indeed, not easy to penetrate." (R.J. Hollingdale).
23 Daybreak: Vorrede: 5: "-this art does not so easily get anything done, it teaches to read will, that is to say, to read slowly, deeply, looking cautiously before and after, with reservations, with doors left open, with delicate eyes and fingers...My patient friends, this book desires for itself only perfect readers and philologists: learn to read me well!-" (R.J. Hollingdale).
24 Nonetheless, three verses of the seventh strophe of An den Mistral, although not obscene, do resume Nietzsche's Southern sojourn: "Tanzen wir gleich Troubadouren//Zwischen Heiligen une Huren,//Zwischen Gott und Welt den Tanz!" The riming of Troubadouren and Huren, plus the alliterating of Heiligen and Huren form mischievous couplets surely meant if not to shock at least to surprise.

ambivalence cunningly composed, out of which rose his Figure of Revenge (Rache). But revenge against whom? Perhaps against those who refused to read him 'slowly', attentively...who refused to take his joking 'seriously'...
Poetry and music are complementary in the Gay Science. A music composer himself, Nietzsche's poetry resounds of rime, alliteration or alliterating couplets,25 homophones and echolia. His rime patterns stir a sort of frolicsome jaunt in a land where the human voice forms meaning because it is the very condition of meaning. The troubadours would have called this poetry trobar ric 'rich poetry': rich in rime and illumination...
A Dancing Song
"Tanzen wir in tausend Weisen, Frei-sei unsre Kunst geheissen, Fröhlich-unsre Wissenshaft!" Die Fröhliche Wissenschaft
An den Mistral: Ein Tanzlied is the last poem of the Gay Science. It is truly F. Nietzsche's supreme homage to Provençal culture; to the poets who created it: the troubadours. Each verse of the eleven sixverse strophe rings of joyous triumph over decadence, resounds of untamed Nature in whose stormy vortex whirls and twirls the Poet of gaya scienza...of Nietzsche's 'method' of attaining the truth.
Ein Tanzlied closes the Gay Science whilst concurrently opens Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Nietzsche, we may say, dances from one to the other, now the poetizing Troubadour, now the poetizing Zarathustra. He welds both Figures to his own whilst building a triptych whose symbolism could be interpreted as Troubadour-Past, Nietzsche-Present, Zarathustra-Future. The gaya scienza is the philosophy of the future, and Nietzsche, the propagator of it. Nietzsche not only invests himself with this propagation, but he actually feels 'biologically' linked to the troubadour. In the initial strophe he makes it quite clear that he and the troubadour are wrought from the same womb which unites their fates:
"Sind wir zwei nicht eines Schosses Erstlingsgabe, eines Loses"
25 By alliterating couplets we mean Nietzsche's stylistic tendency of linking two nouns of the same initial letter by the conjunction 'und': 'Ziel und Zweck', 'Tugend und Tiefe', Geschwüren und Geschwülsten', 'Gerechtig und Geduld', 'Nahrungen und Nothdurfte', etc. Alliterating nominal couplets such as these mark Nietzsche's Art as one that equates signifier and signified (le signifiant et le signifié). Likewise with troubadour poetry, albeit it is assonance that joins and makes emerge the united Force of signifier/signified.

The riming of Schoss (womb) with Los (fate, destiny) elucidates Nietzsche's identification: it is total! And what is their mutual fate? To suffer the same joys and pains of the gaya scienza as the means of existence...
The second strophe sets a rapid rhythm whose swiftness is carried aflow again by playful rimes and consonant clashings. A rushing movement indeed that begins to combine the unfettered Forces of Nature with merry dancing. Nietzsche rimes singst with springst, for the dancing dancer sings and leaps 'outwards', out of social convention and poetic metrical constraint.
The rapid tempo is maintained throughout strophes three, four, five and six, although here Nietzsche forms clusters of brillant images by the use of compound words, which if to the eye appear long and clumsy, to the ear interpolate a variation to the rime-play: present participles (-en) and the genitive caseending (-en) alternate to make us 'hear' the dancer descending from a sky whose powerful Forces have been unleashed:
...Rufen, ...Felsenstufen, ...hellen ...Diamantnen Stromesschnellen (strophe 3)
...ebnen Himmelstennen ...Rosse rennen, ...zücken, ...Rosse Rücken (strophe 4)
...Wagen springen, ...hinabzuschwingen, ...stossen, ...Rosen (strophe 5)
...Rüchen, ...Wellentücken ...Weisen ...geheissen, (strophe 6)
The present participle gives rhythm to the verses: a dashing, violent rhythm which the rime accentuates: the faint calling from above (Rufen) to the poet on the crashing rocks (Felsenstufen), near the raging (hellen), quickening (snellen) diamond-like (Diamanten) river. Then a horse and chariot are winging the dancer down (hinabzuschwingen), his horse racing (rennen), he, now upon its back (Rücken) now upon the backs of billows (Wellenrücken), compared with an arrow (Pfeil) and a golden ray of light

(Goldstrahl). Punctuating this allegro rhythm are the compounds which generate images that give melody to the verses: rocks rumbling (Felsenstufen), rivers rushing (Stromesschnellen), wavering waves (Wellentücken), etc.
In the sixth strophe, Nietzsche's use of the third person plural gradually solidifies his identification with the descended troubadour: henceforth, we read 'wir' and 'unsre'; the 'ich' has been assimilated into the Other-Troubadour 'Tanzen wir' 'let's dance'. And it is in this same strophe that Nietzsche implores us to believe that:
"Heil, wer neue Tänze schafft! Fröhlich-unsre Wissenschaft!"
"New dances must prevade so that our Science will be gay!"26
Nietzsche makes his point in this rime 'schafft/schaft': our science is gay, and for it to be gay, new dances must be composed and danced.
And so in the remaining strophes, Nietzsche addresses his readers with 'we': "Raffen wir..." and "Tanzen wir..." (strophe 7); "Wirbeln wir..." and "Lösen wir..." (strophe 9); "Jagen wir..." and "Hellen wir..." (strophe 10). Troubadour-Nietzsche gallantly dances away or 'hunts away (Jagen) all that darkens the sky, all that hinders the spirit of all free spirits: "aller freien...Geister Geist..." (strophe 10).
The eleventh and last strophe reaches the climax of the Troubadour-Nietzsche's will or desire: to bear 'such joy' Solchen Glücks to the heights of the stars, and there: "Häng'ihn-an Sternen auf!"
Nietzsche's 'joy' in this song is no mere product of Language play: it is a testimonial act of Existence, an energy triggered and conducted towards a specific goal: the gaining of truth. It is thus a method by which he investigates existential and ontological problems. A scientific method of which 'joy' is an organic part. In other words, without joy there would be no science!
The whirling effect -Wirbeln- that Nietzsche's song produces and the wind -Wind- that accompanies it, musically clear the 'dust from the streets' "Staub der Strassen" and from the Heavens -Himmelreich- so that he and the Other -mit zu- may, like Nature's Forces, 'roar their joys':
"Brausen wir...o aller freien/...,mit dir zu zweien Braust mein Glück dem Sturme gleich.-"
to dance like the stormy wind is Nietzsche's missive. It opens the Way for Zarathustra, exposes him to the same Unknown whence he had been created. From a Language hitherto arcane, magical, poetic, one of pure energy, the Troubadour-Nietzsche-Zarathustra Figure is ready to descend the mountain and fray amongst friends and foes alike...

Poetic comparison
Here we shall compare a few poems of Nietzsche and of the troubadours so as to gauge similarities in their rime-scheme and poetic expression. Similarities that measure thus Nietzsche's unflagging empathy towards the wandering poets of the gaya scienza.
A recurrent rime-scheme of Bernard de Ventador (XII° century) was the rime alternate, a four verse strophe ABAB, followed by another four verse strophe CDCD:
"Quan vei la lauseta mover [e] De jói sas alas contra'l rai, [ε] Que s'oblid' e's laissa cazer [e] Per la doussor qu'al c òr li vai, [ε] Ailas! Quals enveja m'en ve [e] De cui qu'en veja jauzion! [ כ ] Meravilhas ai, quar dessé [e] Li còrs de dezirier no'm fon."
27
] כ [
"When I see the lark fly away Gayly within a ray of the sun, Then as if stunned falling away By the gentleness that from his heart come, Alas! How all beings I do envy Whom I see in joyful svelte! And marvel do I that my heart instantly Does not of desire melt.
28
Many of Nietzsche's poems in Die Fröhliche Wissenschaft follow the same rime-scheme: Am Goethe, Dichters Berufung, Bei der dritten Häutung, Im Sommer, Trost für Anfänger, etc. It goes without saying that this particular rime-scheme rhythmed other troubadour compositions, those for example of Taimbaut d'Orange (XII° century).
Troubadours of the XII° and XIII° centuries composed assonanced or rimed sextines. For example, this poem of Arnaud Daniel:
"Lo ferm voler qu'el cor m'intra No'im pòt ges bècs escoissendre ni ongla De lauzengièr, qui pèrt per mal dir s'arma; E car non l'aus batr'ab ram ni ab verga,
27 Michèle Gally and Christiane Marchello-Nizia, Littérature de l'Europe médiévale, Magnard 1985 page 84.

Sivals a frau, lai on non aurai oncle, Jauzirai jòi, en vergièr o dinz cambra."29
"The solid will that within my heart prevails No tongue can rent nor nail Of the scandalmonger who in gossip his soul fails And daring not with branch or birch flail, Secretly where no uncle would hail I shall of my joy in orchards and in chambers avail."30
The assononanced words intra 'enter', ongla 'nail', s'arma 'soul', verga 'birch', or 'branch', oncle 'uncle', cambra 'chamber' are repeated at the end of each verse throughout this forty-verse poem. Now in Nietzsche's 'Prelude' we read his Der Einsame, which although not properly speaking a sextine, does adhere to an identical assonanced pattern. Due to a question of space, we shall only produce the final word of each verse:
...Führen. ...Regieren! ...Schrecken: ...führen! ...Meerestieren. ...verlieren, ...hocken, ...heimzulocken, ...verführen.
The assonance pattern of [e] is enriched by anaphora: führen is repeated three times, and in the last verse by a rime for the eye with the verb verfürhren 'to lead astray, to seduce'. Furthermore, Nietzsche's aesthetic use of rime for the eye recalls the troubadour technique of ending rime. For example, these three verses from Le Roman de Flamenca by Guillaume de Nevers:
"Et d'un cor en autre s'encore Et fai cel s cor tant encorar L'us en l'autre ques acorar"31
"And from one heart to another penetrates And makes these hearts so cognate One to the other that hesitate."32

In a superb homophonic sequence, Guillaume operates semantic shifts between cor 'heart, encore 'to pierce (the heart), encorar 'to unite' and acorar 'to weaken, to flee' with as the root-theme 'the heart' cor.33
Another frequent rime-pattern shared by Nietzsche and troubadour poets is the ABBA rhyme scheme, read, for example, in Nietzsche's Pessimisten-Arznei and Eis, and in Jaufré Rudel, Gillebert de Berneville and Chrétien de Troyes.
Be that as it may, the majority of troubadour and Nietzsche's poetry is composed of riming couplets or heroic couplets. Again from Guillaume de Nevers' Le Roman de Flamenca:
"Aissi Amors si desacorda Et en desacordam s'acorda, Quar tut ensems egal tiram, Desacordam nos acordam."34
"Thus Love with Itself is in disaccord And in this disaccord is accord, For all of us together with equal force draw, In disaccording us we ourselves accord."35
The seeming contrarity of accord and disaccord is in fact complementary, essential to the game of Love (of the Poem?) which echoes Nietzsche's own philosophical and poetic mood when Zarathustra exclaims:
"Und wer ein Schöpfer sein muss im Guten und Bösen: wahrlich, der muss ein Vernichter erst sein und Werthe zerbrechen. Also gehört das höchste Böse zur höchsten Güte: diese aber ist die schöpferische. —''36
Zarathustra is the bearer of good tidings: coincidentia oppositorum! Antitheses that smile in perfect harmony.
Homophones or graphes, rimes for the eye or for the ear, an alternating cadence between the consonantal solidity of alliteration and the melodic softness of assonance constitute the aesthetic foundation of the troubadour's and Nietzsche's gaya scienza. Moreover, much of their poetic craft converges in Form because repetition or anaphora play an essential rôle in their poetic Art, be it aural or ocular, cognate or analogic.

Parataxis
Each aphorism in Die Fröhliche Wissenschaft, in appearance, seems to us as a self-contained monad, yet they, in fact, parataxically linked to one another. Parataxis, as a Figure of Poetry, creates 'spaces' or 'interstices' between each aphorism, maxim or strophe, a sort of moment of silence which the reader penetrates so as to 'fill in the gaps' with his own imagination and reason. Parataxic structures allow an active participation on the part of the reader, or in the case of the troubadour, the listener. Unlike dense, impenetrable syllogism, Nietzsche's airy openness draws the reader into his artistic world of images and figures just as the troubadour drew his audience into this poetic world with the silences of his ceasured verses and strophic narrative techniques. Like aphorisms, the troubadours' strophic narratives, selfcontained in nature, required spaces or rests in order for the poet to inspire and expire, for the public to advance and recede in an enormous respiratory rhythm. Indeed, space and silence condition the possibility of juxtapositioning, of parataxic narration, be it oral or written. With all due reserve, we could compare the troubadours' techniques of oral delivery with Nietzsche's outdoor exercises of thinking (or talking) aloud during his long walks in the mountains. An ambulatory exercise that offered the viator an imaginary reader or listener whose voice, after each spoken thought or aphorism, would emerge out of the interstice of silence in order to rejoin Nietzsche's developing chain of thought. Walking and thinking with and against the Other...Respiratory exercises that little by little gave birth to the image of the Other: Zarathustra? who, conceived in Die Fröhliche Wissenschaft (aphorisms 125 and 342), that is to say, out of the immense imagery of six years of creation (1876-1882), of breathing fresh air, rose out of the interstices of silence in a form that now accomplished the Gay Science now continued it.37
Also Sprach Zarathustra was thought out and composed on the same élan of energy as the Gay Science. Zarathustra reveals the Other: extols the Other with spurts of great generosity. There is no 'excess of manner'38 in this triumph of poetic prowess. The adventure of Zarathustra is one of a laboured fusion of prose and poetry...of the wandering troubadour finally united with that Other...the Amie!
37 Nietzsche was very aware that his work required listening to. In a letter to Lou von Salomé (27/28 june 1882) he epxressed the 'aural exercise' quite clearly:"Dies erinnert mich an meine „fröhliche Wissenschaft.“ Donnerstag kommt der erste Correcturbogen, und Sonnabend soll der letzte Theil des M<anu>s<cripts> in die Druckerei abgehen. Ich bin jetzt immer von sehr feinen Sprachdingen occupirt; die letzte Entscheidung über den Text zwingt zum scrupulösesten „Hören“ von Wort und Satz." "That reminds me of my Gay Science. The first proofs arrive Thursday, and Saturday night the last part of the manuscript must be sent to the printer. I am terrible busy at this moment with stylistic problems of minute detail; the final decisions required by the text need a very scrupulous 'ear' for the words and phrases." (Our translation).

Zarathustra
"Eins ist Noth. — Seinem Charakter „Stil geben“ — eine grosse und seltene Kunst!39 Die Fröhliche Wissenschaft
The beauty of Thus Spoke Zarathustra lies in the accomplishment of a Figure: irony! Zarathustra is perfectly lucid of his situation as an unheeded harbinger. Does he thus glorify himself in contempt? Is he the lunatic who charges into market mobs to proclaim the death of God? A mountain wizard who feasts with asses in dingy caves? Nietzsche's long dialogue with the Unknown gave rise to Zarathustra: a dialogue whose font and mainstay are to be found in the Gay Science:
"-In die Zwischenzeit gehört die „gaya scienza“, die hundert Anzeichen der Nähe von etwas Unvergleichlichem hat; zuletzt giebt sie den Anfang des Zarathustra selbst noch, sie giebt im vorletzten Stück des vierten Buchs den Grundgedanken des Zarathustra."40 (Ecce Homo)
A dialogue that reconciled that sterile dichotomy of poetry/prose by which good prose is written face to face with poetry.
A brief examination of the chapters in Thus Spoke Zarathustra indicates the profound poetic continuity of the Gay Science as they strive to reach stylistic summits of a long-experienced Prose-Poetry narrative drama.
Nietzsche's mastery of fleshing out abstraction, of fitting ideas on to masks attains theatrical triumphs in the 'Of the Three Metamorphoses'. A mise en scène or transformation which, little by little, by way of Zarathustra's discourses, creates Figures: Tarantulas and Addlers whose stinging and clawing evacuate anger, and consequently stave off ressentiment; the crafty dwarf, the heaviest and gravest of all creatures, refractory to the gaiety and light-heartedness of Zarathustra's Philosophy of Life; the Ass, Eagle, Sorcerer, Beggar, King and Leech: Figures that people the universe of Zarathustra, who incarnate attitudes and thoughts, who symbolize either historical figures or friends of Nietzsche. For example, the 'jitaire de sort'41 (sorcerer) is Wagner, the conjuror who delights his audience by tricks of illusion and grandeur...
Figures wrought from 'figures of speech', from ten years of solitude (the Unknown!), Zarathustra bursts onto the scene! But to play what rôle, what histrionic impersonation? Christ, 'on the Mount of Olives', 'of the Apostates', 'the Last Supper', 'the Immaculate conception', 'the Stillest Hour'? Or the knight-errant: 'War and Warriors', in which one must make war against one's Self. Or the alchemist, 'of Science', who concocts a strange brew of poetic bewitchings and prosaic truths, who distills the aurum
39 "To give style to one's character- a great and rare art!" (The Gay Science: 290 R. J. Hollingdale).
40 "The interval is occupied by the 'gaya scienza', which bears a hundred signs of the proximity of something incomparable; finally it gives the opening of Zarathustra itself, it gives in the penultimate piece of the fourth book the fundamental idea of Zarathustra." Ecce Homo: thus spoke Zarathustra: 1 R.J. Hollingdale).
41 'Jitaire de sort' is Occitan.

potabile42 of the gaya scienza? Is he the Architect of his life! The subject of his Discourse whose joyful abandonment resounds of songs and poetry: 'the Night Song', 'the Dawn song', 'the Funeral song', 'the Second Dance Song', all of which are composed in the most poetic prose by word-repetition, alliteration, puns forged by prefix-compounding and antithesis. This poetic architecture organizes an Art of Imagery, an Iconic Art behind which bespeaks days and nights of silent experimentation of Forms. Thus Spoke Zarathustra is not a mere cluster of images tirggered here and there by a few tropes, nor is it a rhetorical exercise. It is rhapsodic hymn to Life where song, dance, poetry and prose feast and quaff at the same table. Where, as in 'the Intoxicated Song', drunken cheer rings out in response to Zarathustra's Rundgesang! Indeed, Dionysian forces unleash their fury like some heavy, narcotic draught, however, if these intense images do reach inebriated crescendoes it is the poet, Zarathustra, who must bridle this fury, learn self-restraint and self-composure. For he is the hyphen that harmoniously compounds the ecstatic state of joyous abandonment (the Unknown) and Creation (poetry).
The last scenes upon the mountain explode in a swell of poetic frenzy: the old sorcerer (Wagner!) takes up his harp and sings his 'Song of Melancholy', a long free-verse poem which heckles Zarathustra: fool or poet?43 To whose harassing verses Zarathustra's shadow responds with a poem of his own: "Deserts grow: woe to him who harbours deserts!" A true hymn to the dignity of man, virtuous man and woman of the desert whose barrenness lay bare the naked truth...
In the final chapter, Zarathustra triumphs with his roundelay to Mankind...to the Higher Men, ending thus a poetic adventure of philosophical import seldom achieved in other writings of philosophers. Philosophical concepts such as the Overman, the Eternal Recurrence and the Will to Power gradually rose out of the Unknown, chaotically, only to find form figuratively in the Gay Science and in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Figures forged out of the fury of Art: the gaya scienza...Images that do not bewitch nor bedazzle but: "Auf jedem Gleichniss reitest du hier zu jeder Wahrheit''. (Ecce Homo)44
The self-composer, F. Nietzsche, robes ideas in Figures. He gives them 'appearance'. There is no 'thing-in-itself', nor any metaphysical will. Concepts walk, leap and dance; they dialogue and debate and sing. In short, they are very human! Human because of the 'human voice' that if listened to, conditions all Rhythmisirung der Rede. The gaya scienza demands absolute adherence to one's problems:
"Die grossen Probleme verlangen alle die grosse Liebe, und dieser sind nur die starken, runden, sicheren Geister fähig, die fest auf sich selber sitzen. Es macht den erheblichsten Unterschied, ob ein Denker zu seinen Problemen persönlich steht, so dass er in ihnen sein Schicksal, seine Noth und auch sein bestes Glück hat, oder aber „unpersönlich“: nämlich sie nur mit den Fühlhörnern des kalten neugierigen Gedankens anzutasten und zu fassen versteht."45
42 The 'liqueur of gold'!
43 "Nur Narr! Nur dichter!"
44 ''Upon every image you here ride to every truth'' (Ecce Homo: Thus Spoke Zarathustra: 3).
45 "All great problems demand great love, and of that only strong, round, secure spirits who have a firm grip on themselves are capable. It makes the most telling difference whether a thinker has a personal relationship to his problems and finds in them his destiny, his distress, and his greatest happiness, or an 'impersonal' one, meaning that he can do no better than to touch them and grasp them with the antennae of cold, curious thought." (Die Fröhliche Wissenschaft: 345 R.J. Hollingdale).



October-December 2014 JOURNAL OF EURASIAN STUDIES Volume VI., Issue 4.

It also demands that philosophers cease to 'verbalize' and return to the Art of thinking in images...in Figures: "Die mächtigste Kraft zum Gleichniss, die bisher da war, ist arm und Spielerei gegen diese Rückkehr der Sprache zur Natur der Bildlichkeit.'' (Ecce Homo)46
And that is the triumph of Zarathustra and of the gaya scienza, be it the troubadours' or his...
The Great Noontide
"— verkünden sollen sie einst noch mit Flammen-Zungen: Er kommt, er ist nahe, der grosse Mittag!"47 Also sprach Zarathustra
Exposure to the warm Mediterranean Sea and to the soft silky blues of Southern Europe gradually formed the Gay Science and Thus Spoke Zarathustra. There, closer to the vissicitudes of Nature, absorbed in the warmth of a people, and to a heritage of 'outdoor living' proffered F. Nietzsche the medium necessary of 'losing himself', of divesting his Self of that professor of classical philology in a country which he no longer deemed essential to his existence. The sad, dismal shadow of his former Northern Self gradually faded under the ardour of Meridian climate and culture.
Be that as it may, the Great Noontide -grosse Mittag- does not consist only of sun- or song-filled exposure; it is also the 'moment of the shortest shadow'; that is, the end of the longest error! Perhaps the zenith of Mankind: INCIPIT ZARATHUSTRA. Again Nietzsche composes in images in order to make his point clear. Noonday. That hour when the sun attains it highest height. A height that exposes all fallacy. A light that vanquishes all shadow: And therefore exposes every truth.
The last will towards power chases erroneous values that have been thought perpetual because fostered through docile Habit. Henceforth, Man is now on his own; he must assume his responsibility of a freed wanderer, adrift in a world without gravity. Man must thus establish a new table of laws, uncover new strengths and forces within himself. Noontide. The coming of Man unto himself: weightless, free from the forces of political and ecclesiastical authoritive weight...
Zarathustra, wandering alone, finds himself at the hour of noon, the sun burning bright over head. He sleeps. Upon awakening he again falls asleep. Is it the heat of the mid-day sun that causes such drowsiness? Nay, mid-day is 'half an eternity' that has been accomplished, the other half lying there yonder:
"O Lebens Mittag! Feierliche Zeit! O Sommergarten! Unruhig Glück im Stehn und Spähn und Warten:Der Freunde harr ich, Tag und Nacht bereit, Wo bleibt ihr, Freunde? Kommt! 's ist Zeit! 's ist Zeit!"48
46 ''The mightest capacity for metaphor which has hitherto existed is poor and child's play compared with this return of language to the nature of imagery.'' (Ecce Homo: Thus Spoke Zarathustra: 6 R.J. Hollingdale).
47 "One day they shall proclaim with tongues of flame: It is coming, it is near, the great noontide!" (Book 3: Von der verkleinerden Tugend: 3 R.J. Holllingdale).

Sleep here does not signify indifference; it is the much merited respite after having gone 'half the way'. But Zarathustra must not dally, nor rob this noon zenith -Tagedieb- of the day for his Destiny has yet to be accomplished: ''Aber denen Allen kommt nun der Tag, die Wandlung, das Richtschwert, der grosse Mittag: da soll Vieles offenbar werden!'' (Also Sprach Zarathustra)49
Zarathustra must return to his crepuscular cavern, there where the strength of the sun and the softness of the night -twilight- prepare the festival of harmonizing contrasts: to experience mid-day and mid-night concurrently...a Time equipose to Eternity!
''„Jetzo erst gehst du deinen Weg der Grösse! Gipfel und Abgrund — das ist jetzt in Eins beschlossen!''50 (Also Sprach Zarathustra)
Emerging from the sun, Zarathustra upon his mountain refuge, seeks the solace of his animals: his Language-Other. For once the noontide sun has dazzled away doctrinal syllogism and herd-animal Habit, he whom the Higher Men deemed a prophet, a dreamer, a drunkard, an interpreter of dreams, a midnight bell, returns into the Night...into the scintillating Unknown, closing thus another cycle:
''Alles geht, Alles kommt zurück; ewig rollt das Rad des Seins. Alles stirbt, Alles blüht wieder auf, ewig läuft das Jahr des Seins.'' (Also Sprach Zarathustra) 51
Exposure to the brillance of the morning and to the silence of the night, and the the Experience of the Poet is a cyclic one: a revolution on the same course, because without this Sameness of course the Other could not emerge.
The Lover of Language, be he Nietzsche-Zarathustra or the Troubadour-Amie has to divest himself of his Self so as not to possess Language to the point of killing it! And that is the supreme Art of the gai saber...
''...;wir aber wollen die Dichter unseres Lebens sein, und im Kleinsten und Alltäglichsten zuerst.''52
48 Janseits von Gut und Böse.
49 ''But now the day, the transformation, the sword of judgement, the great noontide comes to them all: then many things shall be revealed!'' (Thus Spoke Zarathustra: Book 3: Von den drei Bösen: 2 R.J. Hollingdale).
50 ''Only now do you tread your path of greatness! Summit and abyss-They are now united in one!'' (Thus Spoke Zarathustra: Book 3 The Wanderer R.J. Hollingdale).
51 ''Everything goes, everything returns; the wheel of existence rolls for ever. Everything dies, everything blossoms anew; the year existence runs on for ever:'' (Thus Spoke Zarathustra: Book 3 The Convalescent: 2 R.J. Hollingdale).
52 Gay Science: 299 "but we want to be the poets of our own lives, and firstly in the smallest and the most daily things." (Our translation)

In Germany a book has been published this year, which can influence the journalistic ethic everywhere in the world. It is a bestseller without any publicity in German media. Written by a former leading journalist of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the number 1 of German newspapers, the author gives a picture of the forces, persons and organizations active behind the coulisses of the main stream press-media in order to influence public opinion. According to our knowledge the book has not been published in English yet.
The author writes out of his own experiences of many years. He admits, that he was active in the same manner as the common practice sharply criticized by him in his book. On a certain moment he changed his way of handling and decided to publish what he knew. What was his ‘big news’? It was and is – the very ‘down to earth’ experience, that newspapers, radio and TV are not the independent,

‘objective’ media as believed to be by the brave ‘men in the street’. The old basic rule of journalism, ‘facts are holy, your meaning is free’ is interpreted in a subtle way in nowadays’ daily practice. The author arrives at the conclusion, that the main stream press-media became lobby-instruments for influencing public opinion in the interest of high politics, secret services and ‘haute finance’ – he speaks about the ‘elites’ - aiming at the maintaining and extending U.S. supremacy worldwide. The author gives in a schedule several names of persons as well as organizations. It is interesting to see the essential role of among many others the Bilderberg Group as well as other contact-groups and well-known personalities in finance and in global politics. At this level facts are in any case not so ‘holy’ as the public supposes them to be. For the brave citizen are however the press media ‘the last station’, where he collects his information necessary for his daily existence in the different fields of his life. This is a dramatic moment for the brave citizen. What can he do more than to continue to read his newspaper day after day? Consequently he accepts the continuous brain washing and he believes in the information (in fact the disinformation) he receives that way. This is exactly the intention of the manipulators of the media, i.e. the main stream media in order to form and influence our ideas over the totality of our life, but especially of our political and economic existence.
The headings of the chapters express the contents. 1. Feigned freedom of press. Experiences with editors. 2. Our media: brought into the same line, obedient to the authorities, unwilling to accept research. 3. The undercover truth. Alpha-journalists in line with the élites. 4. Buy a journalist for yourself – your news coverage is granted. 5. Some cases from the propaganda-front.
We are living in a period as described by Orwell in his visionary book 1984. When I read it, in 1951, I felt – with WWII behind me – this can become our future. I had this impression, but I couldn’t believe it. I did not want to accept, that we would be capable to deteriorate everything we have fought for during the War in order to build up a better human future than it was before the War. And really, as from the 1960’s there was a general feeling everywhere on earth, that we were driving into the direction of an idealist realm of endless possibilities, where ‘the sky is the limit’. We made use of our possibilities and we misused them. We are still misusing them and we see the negative ‘results’ of this evolution. We are arriving in the last years at the ‘limit’, i.e. the moral limits of our world of culture. Are we? Yes, we are. The truth is the limit. We have to acknowledge this as an unavoidable fact – a moral fact, which becomes a real, historic evidence – e.g. in the recent publications in the US concerning torture by the CIA. Truth is a Universal Force. We are living in an Orwellian historic period, in an apocalyptic period, but we see also the other side of this experience: the purification of the Spirit, the basic reality of our life. Yes we are underway through our ‘Orwellian experiences’ – purification-experiences - to the ‘New Jerusalem’ of the Apocalypse. ‘It is a long way to Tipperary!’
