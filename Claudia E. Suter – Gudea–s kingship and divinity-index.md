Gudea’s Kingship and Divinity
cLAudIA E. SuTEr
Gudea of Lagash persists in being a fascinating figure. Whereas details of his reign remain tantalizingly scarce, his self-representation and posthumous veneration are better documented than for any other early Mesopotamian ruler. His reign fell between the two brief episodes of divine kingship in Mesopotamia. In contrast to Egypt, where divine kingship was the norm throughout its ancient history, only a few early Mesopotamian kings of the late third millennium b.c.e. wrote their names with the divine determinative and established cults to themselves. Piotr Michalowski and Irene Winter have recently argued that these cases were historically determined.1 Raising the question of why divine kingship was such a fleeting phenomenon in Mesopotamia, Jerry Cooper muses: “[S]ince divine kingship cross-culturally seems to be the exception rather than the rule, there could well be some basic human cognitive resistance in pushing any living mortal fully into the category of the divine.”2
Author’s note: I am grateful to Piotr Michalowski for insightful comments on an earlier draft of this essay and for access to his unpublished work, and to the anonymous reader who commented on the manuscript draft. 1.

Brisch (Chicago: Oriental Institute, 2008), 33–45; Irene J. Winter, “Touched by the Gods: Visual Evidence for the Divine Status of Rulers in the Ancient Near East,” in ibid., 75–101. In its most complete version, divine kingship was confined to some Akkad and Ur III dynasts. In both cases, it was the consolidator rather than the founder of the hegemony who introduced self-deification—Naramsin and Shulgi—and it sputtered out after as little as two generations, only to be mimicked by some epigones before dying out completely. As Dominique Charpin (“Chroniques bibliographiques 11,” RA 102 [2008]: 159) suggests, it would be worthwhile examining these “epigones” more closely. 2. Jerrold S.

After having been neglected for some time, the nature of kingship has resurfaced as a topic of research.3 It is now generally agreed that Mesopotamian kingship was always sacred. Whether the king deified himself or not, he stood above humans and close to gods and always partook of some degree of divinity. Gebhard Selz, who makes a point about the inadequacy of a binary approach to the Mesopotamian mind, in which the boundaries between human and divine were fuzzy, concludes that all “3rd millennium Mesopotamian kings could have had—in varying degrees—divine status.”4 In Cooper’s words, “[T]he king is not god but partakes of the divine, and is human, but without many of the limitations prototypical of the human being.”5 In the already cited Oriental Institute Seminar on divine kingship, Selz and Winter touch upon Gudea:6 while Selz situates his divine birth and his intimate relationship with his personal god within Lagashite tradition, Winter points out homologies between Gudea’s hymns and those of Shulgi of Ur, offerings to his statues, his divine election, his outstanding physical properties, and concludes that
the behaviors (and beliefs?) associated with divine status accorded the royal person were de facto if not de jure maintained in the interim between the formally marked/deified rulers of Akkad and those of Ur in the neo-Sumerian period . . . even in a period of rhetorically emphasized piety on the part of the ruler and the absence of an explicit divine determinative, Gudea remains one shaped by the gods, with privileged access to the divine and the cultic observance, and so distinct from ordinary humans.
Although his work is concerned with imperial Assyria, Peter Machinist’s observations on kingship and divinity are particularly useful. Seeking a more flexible definition than the either-divine-or-human distinction, he suggests as a framework the dual function of the king as “both votary of the gods and venerated among his human subjects,” his being viewed as “the primary nexus between heaven and earth, a lynchpin that allows the two realms to communicate.”7 Machinist perceives this duality as inherent in virtually every

tradition of human kingship and proposes that it is the degree of explicitness of divinity that “would vary with which of the two views is given greater emphasis and with how exclusively the king is conceived as nexus to heaven.” In this contribution, I examine Gudea’s kingship in more detail, both in verbal and visual media, with the aim of elucidating how and to what degree of explicitness suprahuman and godlike aspects were developed in the interval between the two episodes of divine kingship in Mesopotamia. This essay was meant to afford pleasure to Victor, with whom I conversed on Gudea many years ago when we both stayed in Philadelphia. Now, it must sadly be dedicated to his memory.
Historical Context
We know little about the political events and constellations of Gudea’s time and cannot even pin down precisely when he reigned; the chronology of the socalled Second Dynasty of Lagash remains unresolved.8 It seems, however, that during this interval between two extraordinary hegemonies, Lagash thrived independently and played a more important role in southern Mesopotamia than the equally independent Ur and Uruk for most of the time. Guti kings from the Zagros Mountains controlled its northern neighbors Umma and Adab, while Puzur-Inshushinak established a short-lived hegemony in the neighboring Susiana and Iranian highlands and occupied for some time an area northwest of Nippur. 9 Under Gudea’s predecessor Ur-Baba, and especially under Gudea himself, Lagash’s sphere of influence seems to have extended beyond the state itself: while Ur-Baba installed one of his daughters in the prestigious office of the high priestess of Nanna in Ur (RIME 3/1.1.6.12–13), Gudea offered a basin made of dolerite to Enlil in Nippur (RIME 3/1.1.7.10), may have set up statues of himself not only in the state of Lagash but also in Nippur, Ur, and Uruk,10 claimed victory over Elam (Statue B 6.64–69), and seems to have built

Gudea uses only one title: ensi2 lagašaki.13 This was the traditional royal title in the state of Lagash, used not only by all Lagash II rulers but also by their Early Dynastic predecessors. Without entering into the enduring debate on Sumerian royal titles, I find the conventional translations of ensi2 as “governor” or “city-ruler”—based on its use for province governors subject to Early Dynastic, Akkad, or Ur III hegemons or rulers of foreign states—misleading in reference to Lagashite rulers, since it diminishes their status. Michalowski and Cooper assert that the titles en, lugal, and ensi2 were just different local words
for ruler used at Uruk, Ur, and Lagash, respectively.14 Lagashite rulers used the title ensi2 lagašaki regardless of whether they were autonomous or dependent on an overlord. By persisting in using this title, Gudea most likely situated himself in the tradition of independent Lagashite rulers. He repeatedly evoked comparison in texts and images with powerful Early Dynastic predecessors as well as with hegemonic kings of Akkad. The ambiguous use of kalam in the Cylinder Inscriptions, which implicitly merges the state of Lagash with the Sumerian world, insinuates Lagash’s control over the latter.15 Moreover, Girsu is stylized as the center of the then-known universe in accounts of Gudea’s import of precious materials for the construction and equipment of temples from all four directions of the wind (Statue B 5.28–6.63; CA 15.4–17.4). These texts obscure the historical situation by implying that there were no other seats of power, as though Gudea were a king of the “four corners (of the universe),” a title introduced by Naramsin of Akkad to celebrate the expansion of his realm and emulated by Iranian kings with hegemonic ambitions, such as Erridu-Pizir and Puzur-Inshushinak, and by Utuhegal of Uruk—all of whom were more or less contemporaries of Gudea.16 The combination of his name with the Lagashite royal title identifies Gudea as a historical person: aside from being an indispensable part of his building and dedicatory inscriptions, the title constitutes the owner inscription on his seal and also occurs as a caption on his images carved in stone, be they statues

nal name”19 and in the divine blessing addressed to him probably by the chief of the Sumerian pantheon: “May your name extend from south to north!”20 We know Gudea primarily as temple builder. Practically all of his monuments deal with temple building in one way or another. It is not surprising, therefore, that a frequent epithet, which occurs in varying formulations throughout his inscriptions, from short factual building inscriptions over elaborate statue inscriptions to the poetic Cylinder Inscriptions, characterizes him as temple builder.21 Since temple building was a royal prerogative that required divine sanction, this epithet situated Gudea beyond humans and close to gods. Gudea’s name—“the one who is/was called”—is original and may well be a throne name.22 It must have evoked his divine election, which is so well attested in his inscriptions. In fact, in the Cylinder Inscriptions, a generic Lagashite ruler is once referred to as sipa dnin-gir2-su-ke4 gu3-de2-a, “shepherd called by Ningirsu” (CB 6.17). There can be no doubt that the wording of this generic ruler was a pun on “Gudea,” because the most detailed passage with regard to his divine election in Statue B states that Ningirsu had chosen him “as the legitimate shepherd of the land.”23 Moreover, “the shepherd” is one of the referents of Gudea in the Cylinder Inscriptions, apart from his name and his title. Sumerian royal inscriptions and hymns employ a large number of stereotype epithets and stock sentences that recount the king’s election and investiture by the gods and often also include his divine parentage.24 These topoi of royal rhetoric with the aim of legitimizing the king’s power go back to Early Dynastic times, when they are particularly well attested in Lagash. Just as the Gudea corpus can be considered the foundation for the Ur III and Isin literary style,25 Gudea himself drew on his Early Dynastic predecessors, especially the powerful Eannatum, as Horst Steible pointed out.26 One should add, however,

that, in contrast to Eannatum, who invokes the top of the Sumerian pantheon in addition to Lagashite deities, the deities that Gudea invokes for his legitimacy are largely confined to the Lagashite pantheon;27 only twice does he link himself to Enlil, and this is in a serving role. One of the longest enumerations of such epithets in hierarchic order of the mentioned deities is the following passage in the colossal Statue D (1.5–2.5):
gu3-de2-a, ensi2, lagašaki Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, mu gil-sa The one of eternal name, ma2-gid2, den-lil2-la2 The one who tows Enlil’s barge, sipa ša3-ge pa3-da, dnin-gir2-su-ka-ke4 Shepherd whom Ningirsu chose in his heart, agrig kal-ga, dnan-še-ke4 Strong steward of Nanshe, lu2 inim-ma še3-ga, dba-ba6-ke4 The man to whom Baba keeps her word, dumu tu-da, dga2-tum3-du10-ke4 The child to whom Gatumdu gave birth, nam-nir-gal2 gidri maḫ sum-ma

In addition to describing himself as a minion of deities, Gudea claims several divine parents.28 The two mother goddesses that appear as birth mothers link him to two dynastic traditions: Gatumdu to his Lagashite predecessors and Ninsun to the mythic kings of Uruk, which he may have controlled before Utuhegal rose to power. In contrast to the birth mothers, Nanshe and Ningishzida play active roles in Gudea’s more poetic inscriptions, which portray his sonship of these deities along the lines of an intimate relation with a superior. While Ningishzida was Gudea’s personal god, Nanshe linked him both to Lagash’s patron Ningirsu and to Enki, as whose sister or daughter, respectively, she is depicted. Enki further insinuated a link to the primeval city of Eridu; and Ningirsu, going one step further, also implied a link to the pan-Sumerian religious center Nippur, since he is repeatedly called Enlil’s son. Gudea’s divine parents thus related him both to major deities and to important cities of Sumer. Rather than adopting the personal deity of his father-in-law, Gudea introduced a new one, Ningishzida, whom his son adopted. Luděk Vacín sees in

this an ambition to found his own dynasty.29 Attested only sporadically before Gudea, Ningishzida was a relative newcomer to Lagash’s pantheon. While Gudea’s inscriptions make it seem as though he had introduced Ningishzida to Lagash,30 the real novelty may have been that Gudea built a temple and established a cult for him. Dietz Edzard observed that Ningishzida’s welldocumented temple in Girsu contrasts with the case of Shulutul, personal god of Early Dynastic kings of Lagash, for whom not a single building or dedicatory inscription is attested;31 the same applies to Ilaba, the personal god of the Akkad dynasty. Both Selz and Vacín argue that Gudea’s relationship with Ningishzida as portrayed in his inscriptions bordered on partial or virtual identity.32 From this perspective, Gudea’s establishment of a temple and cult for his personal god may be understood as an implicit reference to his own divine status. Selz points out the conspicuous absence of the usual caption on the right shoulder of the statues that Gudea dedicated to Ningishzida (Statues I, P, and Q). The Temple of Ningishzida was in the palace area rather than the sacred district, where the temples of all major deities of Lagash were located, and may have been a sort of palace chapel.33 Parallelisms exist not only between Gudea and his personal god but also between him and Lagash’s divine patron. Although the triad NingirsuNingishzida-Gudea occurs repeatedly in this hierarchic order, recalling presentation scenes in which Gudea is led by Ningishzida to an enthroned Ningirsu (fig. 3), the boundaries between ruler and gods can be blurred by crediting the same deed to all of them. The most poetic account of Eninnu’s construction and inauguration, for example, concludes its first part by crediting the building not only to Gudea, who is previously described as agent of the construction, but to the entire triad: “The House: its master (Ningirsu) built it in splendor; Ningishzida set it up on a pedestal; Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, marked its

Most telling is the seated Statue I dedicated to Ningishzida: it reports that Ningirsu gave Ningishzida a home and land in Girsu before accounting for Gudea’s construction of his temple, which, according to this inscription, postdated the construction of temples to all of the great gods of Lagash. 31. Dietz O. Edzard, “Private Frömmigkeit in Sumer,” in Official Cult and Popular Religion in the Ancient Near East, ed. E. Matsushima (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1993), 204. Gudea’s predecessor, Ur-Baba, claims to have built a temple for his personal goddess Ninagal in two summary inscriptions (RIME 3/1.1.6.5 4:4–7; 6 3:8–11). Gudea seems to have followed this path, yet going much further than his father-in-law. 32. Gebhard J. Selz, “Was bleibt?

perimeter.”34 This statement may have been intended not only to bolster the chain of authority and, with it, the legitimacy of Gudea’s temple construction but also to assimilate ruler and gods. Furthermore, the accounts of the Baba or Bridewealth Festival, which Selz and Vacín present as evidence for the virtual identity of Gudea with his personal god, likened him to both Ningishzida and Ningirsu. The festival celebrated Baba’s wedding to Ningirsu as the high point in the cultic calendar of Lagash since Early Dynastic times.35 An important part of the festivities was the delivery of the bridewealth to the bride’s house, which took the form of a procession. Bridewealth was usually supplied by the groom and delivered by his best friend.36 Gudea Statues E and G account for Gudea’s increase of Baba’s bridewealth offerings when he built the temples for Ningirsu and Baba, enlisting all items with their original and new amounts (Statue E 5.1–7.21 = G 3.5–6.19). Both inscriptions mix this cultic level with a mythic level; while Statue E (7.22–8.15) continues to relate that Ningishzida delivered the bridewealth offerings, Statue G includes Gudea in the delivery by introducing the event as follows: “Ningirsu put together a bridewealth that rejoices the heart for Baba, the daughter of An, his beloved bride; his (Gudea’s) god Ningishzida

followed behind it; Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, extended greetings from Girsu to the sacred city.”37 By making his personal god into Ningirsu’s best man, Gudea moved himself closer to Lagash’s patron, and by participating in the procession, which probably corresponded to cultic reality, a partial identity of Gudea and Ningishzida was achieved. The colossal Statue D, finally, summarizes the event in one sentence: “In it (Ningirsu’s Temple), he set out the bridewealth of Baba, his lady.”38 On a cultic level, Gudea supplied the offerings, yet on a mythic level, this was Ningirsu’s task. One could argue that the unnamed agent is Ningirsu, yet the agent of the preceding and succeeding actions is clearly Gudea, plus Ningirsu would call Baba “his bride/wife” rather than “his lady.” As supplier of Baba’s bridewealth, Gudea is cast in Ningirsu’s role. The same intention is apparent elsewhere such as, for example, in the account of the revelation dream, in which Gudea repeatedly addresses Nanshe as “my Nanshe, sister in Sirara,” which is only a hair’s breadth away from calling her his sister and once alternates with “your (Ningirsu’s) sister, child born in Eridu.”39 The tigi-hymn to Baba that recounts Gudea’s appointment by this goddess bears further witness to Gudea’s aim at linking himself to Ningirsu.40 It repeatedly mentions sexual allure (hili), first with regard to Baba herself (lines 2, 6), then with regard to her relationship to both Gudea (lines 17, 21), whom she chooses for it, and Ningirsu (lines 28, 32), who presents her with a lavish offering table, possibly an allusion to the Bridewealth Festival. This hymn foreshadows Ur III and Isin royal hymns that describe the king’s intimate relationship with a goddess in much more explicit terms, and which overly inspired the fantasy of scholars.41 The sexual component should not be overestimated; it was simply another facet of the king’s close relationship with the divine world. The ideological purpose of divine and “sacred” marriages was annually to reestablish the mutual obligations between royals and gods in order to guarantee continued prosperity.

Already in Early Dynastic times, ancestors received funerary offerings on the occasion of the Baba Festival, which was the most important cultic event of the year for the queen of Lagash.42 In the later reign of Shulgi, it was specifically the deceased Gudea and his wife who received special offerings on this occasion, and some of these offerings came from the household of Baba’s ereš-dingir, who was none other than the current ruler’s wife.43 Based on this evidence, together with the special relationships between Ur III queens and Inana and Ur III kings and Dumuzi, Sallaberger suggests that the ruler and his wife were the protagonists in annual festivals that celebrated divine weddings. 44 The sexual union of Baba and Ningirsu is evoked in the Cylinder Inscriptions, which describe Baba sweetening the sleeping place with Ningirsu (CB 17.1–3).45 These lines follow a poetic description of Eninnu’s bed (CB 16.1920) in a metaphor-laden passage that apparently describes Ningirsu’s approval of Gudea’s previously presented gifts by taking possession of them.46 Although Cylinder B recounts Eninnu’s inauguration rather than a New Year’s Festival, the former seems to be timed to coincide with the latter. While the statue in

“Its bed, standing in the bedroom, was a cow kneeling down in its sleeping place. On its pure surface spread (with) clean hay Mother Baba was sweetening the sleeping place with Lord Ningirsu.” 46. Lines CB 16.3–17:16, which I previously took as being preparations for the ensuing banquet (Suter, Gudea’s Temple Building, 100), are better understood as belonging to the previous section concerning the presentation of gifts (CB 13.11–16.2). Gudea presents Ningirsu with a war chariot and weapons and with cult vessels (CB 13.11–14.18), corresponding to Ningirsu’s two principal roles as warrior of Enlil and Išib-priest of An (CA 9.20–10.14); part of the passage under discussion can be understood as describing him on his chariot (CB 16.5–18) and putting the cult vessels to use (CB 17.4–11). The above quoted lines (CB 16.19–17.3), which occur in between, can be related to the agricultural produce brought to the temple in a procession accompanied by music (CB 14.25–16.2) if the latter represents Baba’s bridewealth. In the cylinders, Baba’s role is confined to being Ningirsu’s wife: she enters the newly built Eninnu at her husband’s side (CB 5.10–15) and inhabits it with him (17.1–3); the only other action she performs is sprinkling the bricks to which Gatumdu gave birth (CA 20.19–20). Gudea built her quarters so that she would sweeten her dwelling place (CB 2.23–3.1), which she is described as doing with Ningirsu in CB 17.3.



Gudea’s Kingship and Divinity 511
scriptions accounting for Baba’s bridewealth date this event to “New Year’s Day, the Festival of Baba, on which to make the bridewealth,”47 an elaborate time indication in the Cylinder Inscriptions (CB 3.5–12) that is the only particular calendar date in the entire composition describes the fourth day of a new year and implies, together with other relative time indications, that Eninnu’s inauguration took place during the seven days of Girsu’s New Year Festival.48 I suspect that this timing represents Gudea’s endeavor to integrate himself into the cultic calendar, which may have been responsible for the abovementioned offerings that he and his wife received in Ur III times. Further evidence for Gudea’s ambitions in this direction are the prescription of regular offerings to some of his statues in order to secure their cultic maintenance after his death,49 and a passage from Statue B’s unusually long curse (Statue B 8.10–43), in which Jacob Klein sees Gudea’s “testament” and a direct prototype of Shulgi Hymn E.50 This passage refers to several measures intended to transmit Gudea’s name so that he will attain eternal fame. At least some of them seem to relate to the Baba Festival: the “decree” (di-ku5) that Ningirsu addresses to Gudea on New Year’s may refer to the Cylinder Inscriptions, which recount at length the blessings that Gudea receives for building Eninnu, and/ or it may refer to the recurrent decree of destinies that was the main purpose of New Year festivals; his donations (nig2-ba) may refer to his increase of Baba’s bridewealth and/or offering funds for his statues and/or his inscribed dedicatory gifts in general; the collection of his songs (en3-du KA-keš2-ra2) must include the above-mentioned tigi to Baba, the praise song to Ningirsu (that is, the Cylinder Inscriptions), and possibly also the praise song to Nanshe (ETCSL 4.14.1); the festivals (eš3) set up in Ningirsu’s courtyard must refer to the oc
casions during which his songs would be regularly performed;51 his “decree” (di-ku5) and his “word” (inim), finally, seem to sum up the list.

The term za3-mu marked the high point of the cultic year, which need not necessarily have
coincided with the New Year (Sallaberger, “Neujahr[sfest],” §§1–2). Early Mesopotamian cultic calendars differed from place to place. According to administrative records, the Baba Festival took place in the 11th/12th months in Early Dynastic times and in the 8th month in Ur III times. Nevertheless, because of its etymology and meaning, it was a sort of New Year. The same applies to the Nanshe Festival in Nigin, which was celebrated in the 5th month and is referred to as za3-mu in the Hendursanga Hymn (ETCSL 4.6.1A 25–20).

than chapels, since there was a connection between temple courtyards and the performance of cultic songs, and this connection is attested also for Gudea in CA 28.18; CB 10.9–15; CB 15.19–22.

As a corollary to the convergence of Eninnu’s inauguration with the Baba Festival, the ceremonies related in Cylinder B may well have been modeled on the ritual agenda of that festival. Several features have counterparts in New Year festivals: the agricultural produce brought in procession to the temple (CB 14.25–16.2) recalls the bridewealth procession; the induction of Ningirsu’s staff in the form of a parade (CB 6.11–12.25) recalls the annual review of staff as described, for example, in the Nanshe Hymn; the banquet during which the gods reward Gudea for the temple construction with blessings of prosperity and long life (CB 19.16–24.8)52 recalls the gods’ decree of the king’s destiny on New Year festivals. All these events mix cultic and mythic levels or human and divine spheres with the aim of portraying the human ruler as the linchpin that allows the two realms to communicate; he thus becomes the primary nexus to heaven. An additional parallelism that likens Gudea to both Ningishzida and Ningirsu is their shared comparison with the rising sun. While in the dream in which Gudea receives the divine commission to build Eninnu, Ningishzida appears to him like the daylight that had risen on the horizon,53 during the temple’s inauguration it is Gudea who appears to his city as the sun god rising on the horizon.54 This image of Gudea occurs precisely after his successful induction of the gods into their new temple and before the banquet during which he will receive divine blessings in return. Moreover, it is followed by an image of his entering the temple like a bull with raised head,55 which may have been intended to evoke the horned crown of deities, as Herbert Sauren suggested.56 Ningirsu also is compared with the sun god or daylight: when he enters his newly built temple and when he accepts Gudea’s gifts.57 Ur III to Old Babylonian royal inscriptions and hymns document much more explicitly the equation of the king with the sun god, which probably goes back to the selfdeified kings of Akkad, from whom Gudea is likely to have adopted it.58 As Janice Polonsky convincingly demonstrated, the rising sun was a key image in royal ideology that not only underlined the king’s role as conduit of the course

of destiny for his subjects and thus primary nexus to heaven but also accorded him a divine status. Most translators of the cylinders understand CB 1.15, ensi2-ke4 dingir uru-na-ke4 ra2-zu im-ma-be2, as a direct reference to Gudea’s divinity: “The
ruler, the god of his city, says a prayer.”59 Their understanding, however, is influenced by epithets of hegemonic kings who emphasized their divinity to a higher degree than Gudea, such as using the phrase “god of Akkad,” “Lama of his city,” or “god of the land.” In my opinion, this line should be interpreted, with Thorkild Jacobsen, as “The ruler was going to say a plea to his city-god,”60 since this is what Gudea is subsequently described as doing (CB 2.7–3.4). At the same time, I would not exclude an intentional ambiguity that would have allowed for an allusion to Gudea’s divinity.
Visual Image
Were there any visual attributes that corresponded to Gudea’s royal title? Archaeologists have time and again lamented the absence of regalia in royal images as opposed to literary texts, which associate a number of accoutrements with kingship: headgear, thrones, scepters, and sometimes also weapons and garb.61 In her recent study of the early Mesopotamian royal image, Eva BraunHolzinger suggests understanding this regalia as tropes, due to their supposed absence of imagery.62 To dismiss concrete objects as figures of speech, however, does not convince me. They must have existed in reality. A crown of gold (aga3 ku3-sig17), for example, is listed among the grave goods of a high
priestess in an Ur III administrative text.63 The crux can be resolved by taking into consideration both the definition of regalia in ancient Mesopotamia as opposed to modern perceptions and, since the presence of regalia can depend on context, the narrative or ritual context of the respective images: a standing image, for example, cannot include a throne. Characterization by using varying and not necessarily exclusive elements is typical for ancient Mesopotamia. Regalia comprised a fluid group of objects associated with kingship rather than a standard set, such as one might expect

from a Western point of view, and it did not pertain exclusively to the earthly king but was also linked with kings and queens of the divine realm and with high priestesses, who were conceived as wives of gods. The shape was not standardized either but could change over time and vary with the identity of the wearer. Different-shaped headgear such as the horned crowns of gods, the brimmed caps of kings, and the headbands of high priestesses can all be viewed as the regalia of their wearers, since they were exclusive to their wearers. Three attributes were exclusive to Gudea in his time: a brimmed cap, his particular stool, and a palm branch. The brimmed cap became standard in Ur III times and continued to be the royal headgear into Old Babylonian times.64 It is first attested for Gudea, although Braun-Holzinger points out that the headless statue of his father-in-law and three headless statuettes of PuzurInshushinak may also have had brimmed caps (since they are wearing the same robe as Gudea) and that the statue of Ishtup-El of Mari, who was more or less contemporary with them, wore a brimmed cap with a more flattened shape.65 Whether the brimmed cap was an innovation of Gudea or not, his cap is patterned as opposed to the plain caps of Ishtup-El and later Mesopotamian kings (see fig. 2).66 While Akkad and Ur III kings are always seen with their respective headgear, Gudea is depicted bareheaded before enthroned deities (fig. 3) and seems to wear his cap only when interacting with his subjects.67 This im
64. Some scholars, including Braun-Holzinger (Herrscherbild, 111–15) and Rudolf H. Mayr (“The Figure of the Worshipper in the Presentation Scene,” in Garshana Studies, ed. D. I. Owen [Bethesda, MD: CDL, 2011]) contend that high officials also wore a brimmed cap after Ur III times. Their thesis, however, is based on less than a handful of seals, on which the identity of the presentee or the individual performing the libation is contestable; see my “Ur III Kings in Images: A Reappraisal,” in Your Praise Is Sweet: A Memorial Volume for Jeremy Black, ed. H. D. Baker et al. (London: British Institute for the Study of Iraq, 2010), 338–39. The fact that a caption identifies the presentee as the seal owner on Turam-ili’s seal, which Mayr adduces in support, may in fact just prove the opposite: if the presentee always was the seal owner, then the out-of-the-ordinary caption would have been superfluous. 65.

Whether this applied also to his statues cannot be verified, since they were not found in situ, with the possible exception of Statue I, and because most of them are headless. It is interesting, however, that isolated Gudea-style heads occur with and without caps and that the Gudea statues that wear a cap, including Statue I, are the statuettes dedicated to either his personal god or that god’s consort, which stood in the palace area rather than in the temple district. The same applies also to the statuette of his son Ur-Ningirsu (Braun-Holzinger, Herrscherbild, pl. 53).

plies that the cap signified his authority vis-à-vis his subjects and was indeed conceived as regalia. With the differentiated use of his headgear, Gudea may have harked back to Early Dynastic times, when kings appear bareheaded in ceremonial contexts. Gudea’s stool is attested in all the statues that depict him enthroned: Statues B, D, F, H, I, Q (see fig. 1). Its representation on two seals of Lu-Dumuzi, son of a steward of the deceased Gudea in the later Ur III period, corroborates that this particular stool was Gudea’s individual throne.68 Kings of Akkad are seen sitting on a stool with a pattern that may have represented bound and stacked reed bundles, Ur III kings on a four-legged stool covered with a fleece.69 Since the dynasties of Akkad and Ur III each had their own type of throne, Gudea’s introduction of a new type can be understood as another facet of his ambition to found a new dynasty or even as a claim to the same rank as these hegemonic kings. On three stele fragments, Gudea is seen holding a palm branch, which I have argued may represent his gidru, “scepter.”70 In his inscriptions, Gudea receives the scepter from Igalim (Statue B 2.18–19 = D 1.19–2.1), son and bailiff of Ningirsu, who is described as being in charge of establishing justice as well as the royal throne and scepter (CB 6.11–23). From the Ur III period on, the icon corresponding to a scepter was the so-called rod and ring, which Kathryn Slanski derives from surveying tools used for laying straight lines and interprets as an icon for righteous kingship sanctified by the gods.71 In royal images, these insignia are seen as being held out to kings by gods rather than as being in the kings’ possession because, as Slanski argues, justice and the tools for establishing it remained firmly in the hands of gods. Thus, if my interpretation of the palm branch is correct, Gudea was the only king who had himself depicted with a scepter. In addition to regalia, size revealed Gudea’s rank to be above other humans’. In visual narratives, he stands out by being depicted larger than other

humans.72 To give the ruler prominence by means of size was a common practice from the time of the earliest known royal images in narrative contexts; good examples are the Uruk Vase, the Standard of Ur, Ur-Nanshe’s door plaques, Eannatum’s Stele of the Vultures, and, most pronounced, the victory stele of Naram-Sin. Furthermore, Gudea’s statues were generally larger than the statues of other individuals, who were mainly royal women.73 Only the statues that he dedicated to his personal god and that god’s consort were less than life-size, whereas the majority were dedicated to major Lagashite deities and were approximately life-size; Statues D and U were even larger, a phenomenon well attested for kings of Akkad.74 With regard to attire, Gudea is depicted in a fringed robe in all his public images, whether statue, relief, or seal (figs. 1–3, 5).75 One should add that he is always shown in civilian contexts and never in military pursuits. Gudea never wears the flounced robe of deities that some self-deified kings are occasionally seen wearing—such as, for example, Naramsin on the Pir Hüseyin relief or Ur III kings on seals—and that high priestesses wear as a rule.76 The posthumous image of Gudea in a flounced robe on Lu-Dumuzi’s last seal can be explained as a projection of his posthumous deification under the influence of Ur III royal imagery. Fringed robes originated in Old Akkadian times, when they were worn by high officials—such as, for example, Lugal-ushumgal, governor of Lagash under Naramsin and Sharkalisharri77—and by royal women. By Ur III times, it not only clothed members of the elite but had also become the standard ceremonial robe of sacred and divine kings alike, and this remained so into Old Babylonian times.78 I suspect that it was the Second Dynasty of

Lagash, Gudea in particular, who established the fringed robe as the ceremonial robe of kings.79 Since this robe was not exclusive to kings, it may have reflected their human side. In reality, however, the king’s fringed robe was probably distinguished from that of his subjects by the use of the most precious fabrics and colors, distinctions that cannot be made out in images carved in stone.80 Braun-Holzinger regards hairstyles and beards as the salient features that distinguished early Mesopotamian kings.81 But this applies mainly to hegemonic kings who emphasized their godlikeness to a higher degree than others. Gudea is bareheaded and beardless, like most of his Early Dynastic predecessors, whom he may have intentionally followed in this respect. In sum, the patterned brimmed cap, the unique stool, and possibly also the palm branch composed Gudea’s exclusive regalia, which, together with his larger size, elevated him above other humans. While his throne and scepter remained unique, he was most likely responsible for establishing the brimmed cap and fringed robe as the king’s ceremonial garb for the next two centuries. Whereas regalia and size denoted Gudea’s suprahuman status, other attributes implied his nexus to heaven. The plan or drafting tablet on the lap of his seated Statues B and F indicated his role as temple builder, while the overflowing vase of statue N signified his reception of god-given prosperity (figs. 1–2). Both icons were introduced by Gudea,82 who also introduced the foundation figurine in the shape of the basket carrier, another icon that conveyed the king’s personal involvement in temple construction. Like the king’s ceremonial garb, the basket carrier became standard for the next two centuries. Extended versions of the gods’ bestowal of prosperity on Gudea are depicted on his seal (fig. 3) and in the culminating scene of one of his steles, which doubtless served as a model for the top registers of the UrNamma Stele. Were there any features in Gudea’s images that evoked a divine status? Like other kings, Gudea claimed to be shaped by the gods not only through his
79. Already the statue of Ur-Baba is dressed in a fringed robe. While Braun-Holzinger (Herrscherbild, 86) suspects that Naramsin introduced the fringed robe as a royal garb, I doubt that he would have represented himself in a robe looking like that of his high officials in view of the distinctive garments that he as well as other kings of Akkad are seen wearing in their surviving images. 80. Texts inform us of the variety of fabrics and dyes used for garments; the color red, for example, was reserved for deities, kings and high priestesses; see Hartmut Waetzoldt, “Kleidung, Philologisch,” RlA 6 (1980–83), 19–21. 81. Braun-Holzinger, Herrscherbild, 195. 82. A Gulf stone fragment of another statue that depicted a ruler with an overflowing vase comes from Tello and could have belonged to Gudea as well, although one cannot exclude another late 3rd millennium ruler. The only other king seen holding an overflowing vase is the divine Shulgi on the seal of Utu-girgal (Braun-Holzinger, Herrscherbild, 117).

divine birth but also through god-given qualities such as physical strength and wisdom. Winter argues that these attributes were reflected in Gudea’s statues.83 Even if plausible, her claim is difficult to substantiate due to the scarcity of nonroyal sculpture for comparison. From the Old Akkadian period on, monumental images became more and more a royal prerogative. Whether Gudea Statue R portrayed its donor Namhani or Gudea, to whose life it was dedicated, is difficult to answer, like the similar case of Shulgi-kiursagkalama.84 The difference in build between Gudea and contemporary royal women is due to gender rather than to the divine status of the ruler versus other humans; no clear distinction is apparent, for example, in the sculpting of the ears, in which Winter sees Gudea’s god-given wisdom, based on the etymology of the Sumerian term. In terms of material and style, Gudea adopted features from both his local predecessors and the kings of Akkad. Although he is the first ruler consistently to mention the import of Gulf stone (na4esi) from Oman (kur ma2-ganki) in his statue inscriptions, the first to use this precious hard dark stone for their images in the round were late Early Dynastic rulers from Lagash. Kings of Akkad then made it into the material par excellence for royal images, both in the round and in relief, and Gudea’s father-in-law followed them in using it for his statue.85 With regard to style, Gudea combined the sturdy, block-like appearance of his

local predecessors with a portion of the naturalism of the kings of Akkad. The latter is evident, for example, in the well-articulated musculature of his exposed right arm. Rita Dolce—who stresses Gudea’s adopting from the kings of Akkad in order to reveal his between-the-lines agenda of propagating universal power—correctly observes that he did not adopt the latters’ heroism.86 It would have been precisely hero-like traits, such as the exhibition of a partially nude body or an elaborate beard, that would have evoked god-likeness in images, as I have argued in the case of self-deified kings.87 In addition, Gudea made a point of having his statues carved in stone rather than being made of the same materials as divine images, which self-deified kings did. Nevertheless, there also seem to be allusions to a certain degree of divinity in Gudea’s images. One candidate is a stele fragment that preserves parts of two large stools shaped like Gudea’s throne, yet with a lion head protruding from the side, together with part of a lion on a barrow (fig. 4).88 Although the surface is damaged in the area of the lion protome, the relief is elevated, and the lion’s eyes and nozzle are clearly visible on the original. The stools and the lion sculpture are best explained as temple furniture in a scene that depicted their transport to the newly built temple. Since in Lagash the lion was associated with Ningirsu, the stools must have been intended for this god despite deviating from usual divine thrones. By depicting temple furniture for Ningirsu in the shape of his own particular stool rather than typical divine thrones, Gudea must have intended to liken Lagash’s divine patron to Lagash’s king. Another intriguing case is the door plaque that Gudea dedicated to Ningishzida (fig. 5).89 It depicted his presentation to the now lost dedicatee. The figure leading Gudea by the hand has convincingly been interpreted as Ningishzida’s minister, Alla. He is slightly larger than the ruler, wears the flounced robe of deities, yet lacks the horned crown (principal marker of divinity) and deviates from the norm of representing gods also with respect to hairstyle: his scalp is shaven and he is beardless. As a result of Alla’s anomalous representation, god and ruler look alike. Braun-Holzinger called attention to three more images of Alla that exhibit the same anomalies:90 two Ur III seal images from Tello and an unprovenienced statue identified by the following caption: dAl-la, lugal é kisal sukkal, dnin-giš-zi-da, “Alla, king of the courtyard, minister of Ningishzida” (fig. 6). Although the statue is decapitated, it must have followed the same pattern,

since it is beardless. Braun-Holzinger observes that all four images share a connection with Ningishzida and foreground Alla’s aspect as minister, which is attested only at this time. She suspects that they were confined to Lagash, because other ministers of Ningishida and similar snake gods elsewhere followed the standard depiction of gods. Since Gudea chose Ningishzida for his personal god and made him prominent in Lagash, I suspect that this case of anomalies was related to him in particular. The seals were probably modeled on the sculptures. The statue of Alla is one of the very few stone images of a deity, which were a rarity in Mesopotamia. Frans Wiggermann suggests that it once stood “in the ‘courtyard building’ of a temple of Ningišzida, ready to introduce visitors to his master.”91 This must have been Ningišzida’s chapel in the palace

area of Girsu. The statue cannot be dated with more precision than to Lagash II or Ur III times. There are several possible patrons: Gudea, because he built the temple and dedicated several objects in it, including statues of himself; the Ur III governor of Girsu, who was a namesake of Alla; the prime minister Arad-Nanna whose construction activity in this area is also evidenced in the archaeological record. Alla wears an archaic version of the flounced robe and holds the minister’s staff, just like another minister god on a stele of Gudea. The archaizing robe may have been intended to establish a link to the glorious Early Dynastic past of Lagash, which would be in line with Gudea. If Gudea was its patron, this statue would lend further support to my thesis that Gudea intended to liken himself to gods also in images.
Conclusion
Gudea was deified and venerated in Ur III times probably as a result of both his own striving for inclusion in the cultic calendar after his death and

of Lagash’s special status in the Ur III state.92 While he may have aimed at posthumous deification, he did not explicitly claim it during his lifetime. In contrast to hegemonic and self-deified kings of Akkad and the Third Dynasty of Ur before and after him, Gudea neither used a hegemonic title nor wrote his name with the divine determinative, nor did he have godlike statues of himself fashioned or himself depicted in a divine stance, with a horned headgear, a divine beard, a heroic body or the occasional flounced robe that these kings flaunted to represent their divine status. Yet he alluded to hegemonic power and godlikeness in implicit ways. His pictorial self-representation emphasized his position beyond human and close to gods. Several regalia exclusive to him marked Gudea’s superior status in parallel to his title: his patterned brimmed cap, unique stool, and possibly also the palm branch. Moreover, in visual narratives his figure prevailed over other human figures in size, and most of his statues were considerably larger than those of other donors. Other attributes evoked his nexus to heaven: the plan or drafting tablet on his lap characterized him as divinely sanctioned temple builder in parallel to his temple builder epithet, and the overflowing vase in his hands encapsulated his reception of god-given prosperity in parallel to the various epithets that expressed his divine election and blessings. While the king’s outstanding size was traditional, the two over-life-size statues of Gulf stone and the introduction of new regalia and attributes followed strategies of the kings of Akkad, which can be viewed as an endeavor on the part of Gudea to evoke an equally powerful rank for himself. Hegemonic claims are implicit in Gudea’s more poetic inscriptions which blur the boundaries between Lagash and Sumer and stylize Girsu as the center of the universe, as if it were the only seat of power. These texts also imply a certain degree of divinity by claiming divine parentship on the one hand, and by assimilation to gods on the other. The latter is done by parallelism of actions in temple building, by mixing cultic and mythic levels in accounts of the New Year festival, and by the use of the same simile, the rising sun, for the ruler, his personal god, and his state’s divine patron. In visual images, Gudea’s godlikeness is similarly allusive—such as, for example, in the representation of temple furniture for Ningirsu that is shaped like his own particular stool rather than usual divine thrones, or in the out-of-the-ordinary depiction of a minor god that is evidently assimilated to Gudea’s image. In addition, Gudea’s establishment of a temple and cult for his personal god may be seen as a hidden form of his own worship. How exclusively was Gudea conceived as nexus to heaven? Members of the elite also had access to the divine world: royal women and high officials dedicated inscribed objects to the gods and could be depicted approaching a

deity in a presentation scene on their seal image.93 Yet this access was restricted and bound to conditions, in which Gudea obviously adopted policies of the kings of Akkad. Stone monuments, in particular steles depicting extended visual narratives that included scenes of the ruler interacting with deities, as well as life-size and over-life-size statues remained royal privileges. The same applies to temple building with all media used for building inscriptions and to the commission of songs to the gods that would incorporate the ruler into the cultic calendar. Moreover, donors of gifts to the gods other than the ruler had to include him in their wish for a long life in their dedicatory inscriptions, and high-rank owners of inscribed seals had to mention him as their superior in their seal inscriptions. In conclusion, Gudea’s self-portrait conveyed both suprahuman and godlike aspects in words and images, thus expressing his role as the linchpin that allowed the two realms to communicate. His nexus to heaven was to a high degree exclusive to him. He adopted topoi of his Early Dynastic predecessors as well as the hegemonic kings of Akkad, and introduced several new features, some of which became standard for the next two centuries. Although he never explicitly claimed deification, he alluded to a certain degree of divinity in perhaps more sophisticated ways than the self-deified kings before and after him.
