Eannatum the Great
9-12 minutes
Eannatum, ensi (ruler) of Lagash, from the Vulture Stele. He reigned
from 2454 to 2425 BC.
From the CDLI: Note: the CDLI uses the current spelling for "Eanatum". I
have used the old spelling of "Eannatum" throughout these pages
because this is the most common spelling. Click on the pictures to
enlarge them (the face of the above image of Eannatum has been
partially restored).
Eanatum was the son of Akurgal, and the most militarily successful ruler
of the first dynasty of Lagash. He conducted many campaigns abroad,
including ones against the southern cities of Ur, Uruk, and Kiutu, as well
as states further afield such as Kish, Mari, Akshak, and Susa. He even
reached northeastern Subartu and the eastern regions of Elam, destroying
a city called Mishime. His military campaigns were so widespread that he

was able to claim the title "King of Kish", a title associated with if not
always actually indicating, the unity of the Mesopotamian city-states and
their submission to a single ruler.
Like other Lagash rulers, Eanatum had to deal with Umma and the
unsettled struggle over the Guedena. From the Enmetena cone we know
he was in a strong position to dictate terms of an agreement. He divided
the land with his rival Enakale and established a no-man's land
along the agreed border, marking it with his own boundary stele and
restoring the previously ruined stele of Mesalim, in addition to building
shrines to Enlil, Ningirsu, and Ninhursag near the division. He also
imposed a tax on Umma for the use of its share of the Guedena, which
grew to huge proportions and in the time of his descendants resulted in
another invasion by Umma into Lagash's side. To enforce the agreement
he made the ruler of Umma swear an oath to the gods not to violate the
borders.
Much information about Eanatum's deeds comes from the famous Stele of
the Vultures, a fragmentary inscription that depicts in both verbally and
graphically powerful ways the military exploits of the king of Lagash. One
fragment shows the god Ningirsu holding a mace in his right hand while
his left holds a net that has bagged a number of helpless enemy soldiers.
Another section shows Eanatum leading a heavily armed phalanx of
soldiers trampling slain enemy underneath. Yet another shows men piling
up corpses into a giant heap, an image which is reflected in the text.
The stele also gives testament to developments in the ideology of kingship
which are promoted by later Lagash rulers. Eanatum is the first Lagash
king to explicitly claim divine birth by a god, in this case Ningirsu.
Inheritors of the throne would go on to do likewise, as when Eanatum's
son Enanatum I [sic] named the god Lugal-URU11 his father, and when
Enmetena names Gatumdug his divine mother (Bauer pg. 462). Along
with the divine progenitor comes a divine wet-nurse, that is, a female
goddess who suckles the king to make him strong. For Eanatum this figure
is the ancient goddess Ninhursag (Ean 01, IV). Other kings, down to the
Neo-Assyrian period, would also make use of this motif. The stele also
describes how Ningirsu visited Eanatum in a dream where he instructed
him to make war on Umma. This motif surfaces again in the cylinder
inscriptions of the later king Gudea, where he narrates how Ningirsu

explained the plan for the (re)building of his E-ninnu temple.
[Note: Enanatum I was Eanatum's brother, not his son. jjs]

Eannatum, the Great
It makes sense that Eannatum would first settle accounts with Umma
before he set out for conquests further afield. Umma and Lagash were
neighboring cities, traditional enemies that had long disputed the
ownership of the Guedena, the fertile plain that lay between them. This
land dispute had been a point of contention for many years, since before
the days of Eannatum’s grandfather, Ur-Nanshe. During that time,
Mesalim (mentioned above) the king of Kish, was called upon to arbitrate
the dispute. His ruling was very favorable to Lagash. This
caused the lingering resentment of Umma, which periodically erupted into
warfare. In an attempt to reclaim the territory, the army of Umma would
sometimes march into Lagash and “smash to bits” the steles that had been
erected to mark the border. This happened during the reign of Akurgal,
Eannatum's father, and it would happen again during the reign of
Enmetena, Eannatum’s nephew. Given the situation, it was imperative
that Eannatum first secure his homefront before he attempted any other
conquests, in the same way that Alexander of Macedon first subdued
Greece before he ventured into Asia.
Next, Eannatum moved against Elam, the longtime foreign enemy of the
Sumerians (the Elamites would later destroy Sumerian civilization in
2004 B.C.). Elam was part of what today is modern Iran. The capital of
Elam was the city of Susa, which Eannatum destroyed, along with several
other cities. Eannatum had now secured both his eastern and western
flanks (Elam and Umma) against counter invasions (foreign or domestic).
He had possession of the fertile fields of the Guedena with which to feed
his army, and he was collecting tribute from Umma and Elam. He could
now turn his attention toward Sumer.
The conquest of Sumer need not have been particularly bloody. After what
happened to Umma, it may have been enough for Eannatum to simply
show up with his army outside a Sumerian city in order to secure their
surrender. A few Sumerian cities resisted; most notably Ur and Uruk.
After these armies were defeated, the other cities fell into line

(significantly, Eannatum says he “defeated” Ur and Uruk, not “destroyed”
them, as he did with Susa).
It's been speculated on whether or not Eannatum personally led his troops
into battle, or if he just depicted himself this way for propoganda
purposes. On the Vulture Stele, it states that Eannatum was struck by an
enemy arrow during the battle against Umma. Eannatum himself
broke off the arrow and continued the attack at the front of his men. This
telling detail suggests that Eannatum personally led his troops into battle.
This is another way that he resembled Alexander the Great.
All that remained was to conquer Akkad. Given the mutual histories of
Sumer and Akkad (described on the Sumerian History page) it was
inevitable that he eventually attack Akkad. He conquered the Akkadian
city of Kish, along with Kish’s Akkadian allies from the cities of
Akshak and Mari. In so doing, he thus became the “King of Kish”. This was
the traditional title given to anyone (Sumerian or Akkadian) who ruled
both Sumer and Akkad. He now ruled all of Mesopotamia, from southeast
Ur to northwest Mari, considered to be the extreme outpost of
Mesopotamian civilization. Since he also controlled foreign territories, it
could be said that he created the first empire known to history. Although
small by later standards, it was truly an empire because Eannatum ruled
his entire nation (Sumer), the neighoring city-states of the Akkadians, and
the lands of the foreign barbarians, the Elamites. Like Alexander,
Eannatum had conquered most of his known world. He was now at the
pinnacle of his power.

It represents Eannatum in a temple setting.
A period of peace followed these many battles. Like other builders of
empire, Eannatum was also a builder of cities (Nigin, for instance) and
temples (for Enlil, Ningirsu, and Ninhursag). He also made several
attempts to build a coalition of states. In this regard, he was like
Alexander the Great, who attempted to unite the Greeks, Persians, and
Macedonians. Eannatum was one of the world’s first statesmen; he was
not just a warrior thug like Attila, who was only in it for the plunder. He
was trying to unite the warring states of Sumer and Akkad into a single
unified nation. It was a thankless and difficult task trying to rule a region
so rife with war, civil or otherwise, where all of the numerous city-states
proudly defended their independence and their own self-interests.

The brief interlude of peace soon ended. The Elamites launched a
counterattack against Eannatum, which he was barely able to repel. This
was quickly followed by another attack by Kish and Akshak, whom
Eannatum had only recently subdued, followed by a second attack
from Elam, and then another attack from the combined armies of Kish,
Akshak, and Mari (!) Eannatum defeated them all, "in pitched battles
fought at the Asuhur, Lagash's eastern boundary, and the Antasurra, its
northern boundary." Zuzu, the king of Akshak and the leader
of these counterattacks, was particularly vexatious for Eannatum.
In the year that the king of Akshak rose up,
Eanatum, the one nominated by Ningirsu,
from the Antasura of Ningirsu
Zuzu, the king of Akshak,
all the way back to Akshak he smote,
and he obliterated it.
He not just “defeated” Akshak, or “destroyed it", but “obliterated it",
which shows some of Eannatum’s frustration with the king of Akshak.
Interestingly, Eannatum states he obliterated the city of Akshak, but he
doesn't say he killed its king, Zuzu, even though he boasts of
killing other kings. Perhaps the wily Zuzu once again got away.
During his lifetime, Eannatum was never defeated in battle.
Another period of peace soon followed; but Eannatum wasn’t able to enjoy
the fruits of his victories for very long. He died soon after. The suddenness
of his death, and the fact he was succeeded by his brother, Enannatum I,
rather than by his son, suggests Eannatum was killed in combat. Perhaps
he had finally overreached himself in yet another final battle. An
alternative explanation is he had worn himself out with the exertions of
his thirty-year reign. One thing is certain, Lagash would never again rise
to the preeminence it had with Eannatum. There would never again be a
king of Lagash quite like Eannatum, the Alexander of his day.

The Vulture Stele.
Before giving a translation of the Vulture Stele, it is a good idea to begin
with a translation of the "Eannatum Boulder". It serves as a useful
prologue for the Vulture Stele, and it has many of the lines that are
missing from the stele due to damage. The translation is from the
Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative, CDLI P222400.

Eannatum leading his men to victory. They march over the bodies of
their enemies. The stele commemorates Lagash's victory against the
neighboring city of Umma. Lagash and Umma had a long on
going struggle that lasted for many generations as they battled for
possession of the Guedena, the fertile fields that lay between the two
cities. For a history of the conflict, see War: Umma and Lagash.

Vulture Stele, obverse. The shadowed portions of the stele are the parts
that are missing.
On the front of the stele is the war god Ningirsu holding a net full of
captives. Using a mace, he strikes the head of a prisoner who is struggling
to escape. The net is held shut by Anzud, the lion-headed eagle, the god of
storms. He was the "animal familiar" of Ningirsu, and thus
symbolized war. Anzud is also represented as a battle standard on both
registers. Inanna, the war goddess, appears with Ningirsu on both
registers. Eannatum thus attributes his victory to the gods.
Eannatum, the son of Akurgal, claimed that his "divine father" was the
war god Ningirsu. His name is a tribute to Inanna, the goddess of war. The
E-anna was her most important temple. As described in the translation
Vulture Stele Translation about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/38801.html

below, "she called him a good name." E-anna-tum means "Befitting the
E-anna (temple)." Eannatum was born to be a warrior.
The Louvre, where the stele is kept, has the goddess on the front of the
stele misidentified as Nanshe, rather than her sister, Inanna. Nanshe is a
water goddess associated with fertility and social justice. Inanna is a war
goddess who is usually portrayed with maces behind her, as shown above.
According to the inscriptions, Ningirsu came to Eannatum in a dream and
told him to commence the war with Umma, assuring him of victory.
Ningirsu was not just the god of war, he was also the patron deity of the
city of Lagash. The front of the stele is meant to show that Eannatum's war
with Umma was sanctioned by the gods.

On the back of the stele, Eannatum leads his troops to victory on foot and
in a chariot.
On top, vultures feed on the enemy dead. In the second register,
Eannatum's soldiers attack
in a phalanx formation, trampling the bodies of their enemies. They are
identically armed and equipped with spears, battle axes, shields, and
copper helmets. At this period of history, copper was scarce, so swords
were not used by the infantry. The spots on the shields are the identifying
ensignia of the army, to make the soldiers recognizable on the battlefield.
The soldiers attack in a tight, disciplined formation, with many men acting
as a single unit. This is not a chaotic melee of individual warriors engaged
in single combat that is typical of
the more primitive forms of ancient battles. The Vulture Stele, along with
the Standard of Ur, is the world's first depiction of organized "modern"
warfare. On the right, enemy bodies
pile up before the onslaught of Eannatum's army while the enemies who
are still alive
run away in full retreat. It looks as if one of them is actually climbing over
the mound of his dead and dying comrades in a mad scramble to escape.
The enemies are shown naked
to symbolize their abject defeat.
In the second register, Eannatum attacks in a chariot. His chariot
is equipped with maces, javelins, and a battleaxe. He charges into battle
wielding a sickle sword in one hand and a giant spear in the other. These
details are best seen in a separate picture. There has been some debate on
whether or not the curved weapon is actually a sickle sword. It is
composed of three strips banded together with metal straps, which seems
like an unlikely construction for a sword. In any case, it serves the same
purpose, being a curved weapon that is used for striking and slashing. The
drawing shows the chariot as a two-wheel vehicle, but it is in fact a
four‐wheel vehicle, like the chariots on the Standard of Ur, because it
carries two passengers. The arm of another soldier (driver) is shown in the
damaged area behind Eannatum.
The stele shows Eannatum leading his men into combat. This not just a
propaganda ploy meant to imply that he is a great warrior, it reflects the
story told in the inscriptions:
Vulture Stele Translation about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/38801.html

They fought each other,
and towards Enanatum
a man shot an arrow.
He was penetrated by the arrow,
but he broke it off.
He then continues the attack at the front of his men. This proves that
Eannatum personally led his men into combat. He wasn't the kind of
general who directed the battle from the safety of the rear lines.
In the third register, Eannatum presides over the funeral rites of the men.
A naked priest (Sumerian priests were often portrayed naked) pours
libations from a spouted vessel onto a row of plants (perhaps date palms,
symbolic of victory) watering them to overflowing. A bull, lying on the
ground and tied to a stake, is about to be sacrificed in thanksgiving to the
gods.
Though it's been said Eannatum is presiding over the funeral rites of his
men, the funeral is actually for the enemy dead. The scene shows men
with baskets of soil on their heads having to climb ladders in order to
dump the dirt on top of the bodies. It's highly unlikely that
Eannatum would portray such a gruesome reminder of the high cost of his
victory. Instead,
the scene depicts a story told by the inscriptions on the Vulture Stele:
"Umma he defeated, and its 20 tumuli [burial mounds] he heaped up." By
conducting the funerary rites, Eannatum is being properly respectful to
the enemy dead. After all, they are fellow Sumerians. This same
conciliatory attitude toward his defeated enemies is also shown on the
Standard of Ur (see Standard of Ur: King).
The format of the stele suggests there may have been two battles, one in
front of the city during the seige, and one inside of the city after it was
taken by storm. The bottom register shows Eannatum reaching across
with a long spear and stabbing someone in the face. The person is drawn
larger than the other men to indicate his greater importance. This is
probably the king of Umma, "Usurdu, by name", and thus is symbolized
his death.
