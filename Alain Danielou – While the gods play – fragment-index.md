WHILE THE GODS PLAY
ditions, mentions in his encyclopedia this migration of Indian populations, which he calls Garamantes and which, via Egypt, may have come to Spain and from there moved as far as to Great Britain.3According to a theory today supported by So viet historians, this migration took place in the opposite di rection, that is, from the Mediterranean toward India, thus linking it with the myth of Atlantis. The Dravidian languages, which are agglutinative like Su merian, formerly spoken in the whole of India, today survive essentially in the south. The main languages are Tamil, Kanara, Telugu, and Malayalam. However, in central and north eastern India as far as Baluchistan on the Iranian border, there remain pockets where Brahui is still spoken. Aggluti native languages similar to the Dravidian languages which have survived in the West are Georgian, Basque, and Peuhl, peripheral traces of an ancient culture surviving on the edge of the Aryan world. The Pelasgi of pre-Hellenic Greece were, in all likelihood, Dravidian.4 Ligurian was a Euskaroid language related to Basque, as probably the Etruscan language was. Recent studies on blood types have related the pre-Aryan origin of Caucasians, Basques, Sardinians, and Berbers.
Descending neither from Cro-Magnon man nor from the Celts, the populations living on the edge of western Europe and in some Mediterranean centers are therefore of Neolithic origin, their arrival taking place between the departure of the CroMagnon men, who set out for the North with their reindeer, and the Celtic invasions of the Bronze Age. . . . These pop ulations . . . live in countries “at the end of the earth,” the western extremity of Britain, a fringe of Normandy, Wales, North Scotland, Ireland, Iceland . . . [and also] certain Med iterranean regions, isolated or in refuge, like the inhabitants of the mountainous Massifof Sardinia, Corsica, several alpine valleys, the inhabitants of Liguria, some of the Berbers of the Saharan Atlas Mountains, some groups of Tuaregs. . . . the blood of these insular or isolated fringe populations is close to that of the Basques with a high occurrence of type O.5
