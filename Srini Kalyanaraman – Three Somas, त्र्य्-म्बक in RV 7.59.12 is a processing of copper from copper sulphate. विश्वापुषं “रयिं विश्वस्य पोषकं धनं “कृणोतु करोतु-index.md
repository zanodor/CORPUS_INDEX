Copper Reducing Furnace at Khetri. From Ball's Economic Geology of India. (See p. 140-41 of PC Ray's work).
‘The following extracts from Ball’s ‘Economic Geology of India’ will also throw considerable light on this subject (minerals). It will be seen how in India the traditions of the technical arts of which we get vivid glimpses in the Rasarnava have been preserved even to our own days from time immemorial. ‘Rajputana – Copper ores are found in several of the Independent States of Rajputana, and also in the British district of Ajmir. Mining has been practiced on a large scale, but at present the trade of miner is becoming extinct and the operations, which are only carriedon in a few of the localities are of a petty nature. The names of the States in which there are mines are as follows: Alwar, Bhartpur, Jaipur, Udepur, Bundi and Bikaner. Alwar State – According to Mr. Hacket there are ancient copper mines at the following localities in this state: Daribo, Indawas, Bhangarh, Kusalgarh, Beghani, Pratabgarh, Tassing and Jaisingpura. The most important of this is the first. Deribo – The mine is situated on a sharp anticlinal bend in a thin

band of black slates intercalated in the Alwar quartzites. There appears to be no true lode; the one, which is pyrites mixed with arsenical iron, occurs irregularly disseminated through the black slates, a few specks and stains only being seen in the quartzites; occasionally rich nests of ore were met with...From an interesting account of Major Cadell, the following facts regarding the manufacture have been extracted. The ore, as usual in the native process, is pounded, made up into balls with cow-dung roasted, and then smelted in a closed furnace and refined in an open charcoal fire. Thirty pounds of ore require four times that quantity of charcoal and yield 5 1⁄2 pounds of metal or 16.6 percent. During the last 12 years the average annual outturn has been only 3 tons 8 cwts., and it is diminishing owing to the influx of European copper. Singhana (Jaipore State) – The copper mines at Singhana are situated in rocks belonging to the Arvali series. The earliest account of these mines which is believed to have been by Captain Boilcan, was published in the year 1831. The principal productions were copper, blue vitriol or copper sulphate, alum, and an ore of cobalt called sehta or saita. The mines are described as being tortuous and of great extent; at the working faces it was the custom to light fires which caused the rock to split up. Lamps were used which the miners carried on their heads and with a gad and hammer extracted the ore. The principal ore found appears to have been pyrites. It was sold retail by auction to the proprietors of different furnaces. The pounding or crushing was effected on stone anvil with a hammer weighing eight or ten seers; when completely reduced to powder the ore was made up into balls with cow-dung and roasted. The blast furnaces (vide illustrations) were prepared in the following manner. A quantity of common sand was spread on the door of a circular cut, in the centre of which a depression, 12 to 15 inches in diameter and 2 or 3 inches deep, was made; in this a layer of fine sand another of ashes were laid to prevent the metal from adhering to the bottom of the receiver; two clay nozzles or tuyers were then placed on opposite sides of this hollow and a third between them, leaving the fourth side vacant for the slag to escape. The nozzles were then connected by moist clay and a circular rim of mud, a few inches in height, was raised, on which three annular vessels of fireclay were placed to form the body of the furnace, each of these was 15 inches in external diameter, 10 inches high, and 3 inches thick. They were used repeatedly, but the lower part of the furnace had to be reconstructed for every charge. The bellows were simply goat-skins connected with the nozzles, and were worked by the families of the smelters. After a preliminary firing, to dry the mud, the furnace was charged with charcoal, roasted ore and iron slag, the latter being employed as a flux. In a day of nine or ten hours’ duration, 3 maunds of charcoal, 2 1⁄2 of the roasted ore, and 2 of the iron slag were
consumed. The slag was drawn off and the smelted copper which had accumulated at the bottom of the furnace was removed on the following day. It was then re-melted and refined in an open furnace under a strong blast from bellows, and cast into small bars or ingots, which were subsequently removed to the Mint and cut up and fashioned into coins. The ore was said to yield only from 2 1⁄2 to 7 1⁄2 percent of metal, but the profits must have been not inconsiderable as the Khetri Raja is said to have claimed one-sixth of the value of the copper in addition to Rs. 14,000 received for the lease. The quality of the metal is said to have been inferior to that of Basawar, this being attributed to the use of the iron slag as a flux...Considerable quantities of blue vitriol (copper sulphate), alum and copperas (iron sulphate) are manufactured from the decomposed slate and refuse of the mines. The slates are steeped in water, which is afterwards evaporated in large iron vessels, when the blue vitriol, is crystallized out, afterwards the alum, and lastly the copperas. Mr. Mallet found traces of nickel and cobalt in all three of these substances. Copper smelting in the Singhbum District (Bengal)—Indications exist of mining and smelting have been carried on in this region from a very early period, and the evidence available, points to the Seraks

or lay Jains as being the persons wh, perhaps 2000 years ago, initiated the mining (Proc. As. Soc. Bengal, June 1869, p.170). The number and extent of the ancient workings testify to the assiduity with which every sign of the presence of ore was exploited by these early pioneers and those
who follow them up to recent times...Alum and Green Vitriol. Dutt speaking of alum states: ‘it is not mentioned by Susruta, in his list of metallics, but later writers give its synonyms and uses.’ This is evidently incorrect. Alum, with green vitriol, is distinctly referred to in Susruta, e.g.’’
In the above sloka surashtraja, lit., begot of Surashtra (modern Surat), is used in the sense of alum. From the ancient times the ‘earth of Surat’ has been known to yield this mineral. Amara
Simha in his Lexicon, written sometime between 400-600 AD, gives among others the following synonms of alum: kAmkshI, tuvarI and surashtraja. Rasaratnasamucchaya also gives the same synonyms (Bk. III, 59-62). The manufacture of alum survives to our own days, as the following descriptions will show: ‘Alum shales, so called, are of rare occurrence in peninsular India, and, so far as is known, the only considerable native manufacture is situated in Rajputana; but as will be gathered from what follows, the tertiary rocks of the extra-peninsular regions often contain such shales. In two localities lumps of alum...occur naturally in sufficient abundance to be a regular article of export. Alum is principally used as a mordant in dyeing, but as a drug its employment is extensive in India. Behar—Captain Sherwill in 1846 (Journ. As. Soc. XV, p.58) stated that a small quantity of alum was manufactured from slates obtained in the district of Shahabad; these rocks, it is believed, belonged to the Bijigarh pyritous shales of the Kaimur group of the Vindhyan serie. The alum was sold at the high price of one rupee per tola; it was identical with the salajit of Nepal. Copperas or iron sulphate is obtained in the same region, which is situated to the north of Rotasgarh, and to the west of Sone. Rajputana, Khetri, and Singhana – In connection with the copper mines at the above localities there are manufactories which turn out considerable quantities of blue vitriol (copper sulphate), copperas (iron sulphate), and alum. The process has been very fully described and illustrated by Colonel Brooke. In 1864 there were twenty of these factories at Khetri and about double the number at Singhana. The broken shale from the mine which contains the salts is placed in earthen gharas, together with crusts from the refuse heaps of previous lixiviations and water is added. The gharas are arranged on ledges prepared for the purpose on the heaps of refuse, as will be seen by reference to the woodcut (vide illustrations). Each charge of shale is exposed to three changes of water and the water itself is changed fom one ghara to another till it has taken up the sulphates from seven different steepings. It is then of a thick dirty-bluish colour and is taken to the boiling house, where it is boiled in earthen gharas; when sufficiently concentrated it is left to cool, and thin sticks being introduced the blue vitriol crystallizes on them The mother liquor is then poured off and again boiled, and on the addition of saltpetre, the alum crystallizes at the bottom of the vessel. The residual sulphates still in solution, are allowed to crystallize out by exposing the mixture to the sun. (pp.139-147)

“CUTCH – There are numerous accounts of the manufacture of alum in Cutch. Manufacture of alum. The earliest account (of manufacture) is by Captain Mc Murddo, who states tthat before 1818 the exports of alum amounted in some years to several hundred thousand maunds, which chiefly went to Guzerat and Bombay to be employed in dyeing. The following account by Mr. Wynne is the most recent and complete. The site of the operations is Mhurr or Madh. ‘The rock containsing the material is a pyritous dark-gray or black shale, which is in close association with a soft aluminous psudo-breccia of the sub-nummulitic g group. This shale is extracted from pits and is exposed for four months, a slow combustion taking place owing to the decomposition of the pyrites. It is then spread in squares resembling salt pans and sprinkled with water. After about 12 days it consolidates into efflorescing mamillated crystalline plates or crusts called phitkari-kabij or seed of alum. These crusts are boiled in large iron vessels (luted inside with lime), together with saltpetre (or other potash salt), in the proportion of 15 of ‘alum seed’ to 6 of the latter; when it has settled, the liquor is placed in small earthen vessels somewhat the shape of flower-pots, and crystallization takes place in three days. These crystals are again boiled one or more times in concentrate the solution, which is finally ladled into large thin bladder-shaped earthen mutkās or gharās with small mouth; these are sunk into the ground to prevent their breaking, and in five days the alum is found crystallized in masses. The vessels are then broken and the alum is stored. Alum is also manufactured from the water of a hot spring north of Mhurr. The impure saltpetre, which is employed to supply the second base in the above-m,entioned manner, is obtained by lixiviation of villae refuse. (Ball’s ‘Economic Geology’, pp. 431-33). Iron Sulphat. The green vitriol or copperas of commerce, which is known to the natives as kahi and hara kāsis, is produced principally from the so-called alum shales from which alum, copperas is found sometimes as a natural exudation upon alum shales and other rocks which include iron pyrites. This native copperas goes by several different names in India, according to the nature of the other substances with which it is combined. Behar. In the year 1833, Mr. J. Stevenson published an analysis of native sulphate of iron obtained from Behar, which was at that time used by the native dyers of Patna. He found that it consisted of – Iron sulphate 39.0; Iron peroxide 36.0; Magnesia 23.0; Loss 2.0; Total 100. (ibid., p.419) s ’”(pp.149-150)

5mm wide monocrystal of blue vitriol (cupric sulfate)
Blue vitriol/Vitriol of Cyprus/Roman vitriol --j Copper sulphate -- CuSO4·5H2O
Dyeing
Copper sulfate can be used as a mordant in vegetable dyeing. It often highlights the green tints of
the specific dyes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper(II)_sulfate
Etching
Copper sulfate is used to etch zinc or copper plates for intaglio printmaking.[32][33] It is also used
to etch designs into copper for jewelry, such as for Champlevé."Champlevé is
an enamelling technique in the decorative arts, or an object made by that process, in which
troughs or cells are carved, etched, die struck, or cast into the surface of a metal object, and filled
with vitreous enamel. The piece is then fired until the enamel fuses, and when cooled the surface
of the object is polished. The uncarved portions of the original surface remain visible as a frame
for the enamel designs; typically they are gilded in medieval work.[1] The name comes from the
French for "raised field", "field" meaning background, though the technique in practice lowers
the area to be enamelled rather than raising the rest of the surface.The technique has been used
since ancient times, though it is no longer among the most commonly used enamelling
techniques."
A similar technique was known as "shippou-zogan" in Japan, where it was considered a form
of damascening. Damascening is the art of inlaying different metals into one another
typically, gold or silver into a darkly oxidized steel background—to produce intricate patterns
similar to niello. The English term comes from a perceived resemblance to the
rich tapestry patterns of damask silk.

The kris consists of three parts; blade (wilah), hilt
(hulu) and sheath (warangka) "The making of a kris
was the specialised duty of metalworkers
called empu (lit. "possessor") or pandai besi (lit. "iron
skilled"). In Java the honorary title empu refer to those
ironsmiths who possess the special skill of forging the
kris. According to Javanese beliefs, a kris empu should
possess knowledge, technical skills and also spiritual
prowess, since kris are believed to have physical and
spiritual presence.[30] This was meant to differentiate
the masters from common pandai besi that mostly
create common metal tools or peasant's weapons
like parang or golok. In old Majapahit, a kris
bladesmith was referred to as pande and all were
reputed to be able to work hot iron with their bare
hands. The people of Majapahit would eventually flee
to Bali where the occupation has been preserved by the Pande clan to this day, members of
whom also make jewellery. A bladesmith makes the blade in layers of different iron ores and
meteorite nickel. Some blades can be made in a relatively short time, while more intricate
weapons take years to complete. In high quality kris blades, the metal is folded dozens or
hundreds of times and handled with the utmost precision. Empu are highly respected craftsmen
with additional knowledge in literature, history, and the occult....In former times, kris blades
were said to be infused with poison during their forging, ensuring that any injury was fatal. The
poison used to polish kris blade is called warangan.The process of chemical coating was done
by warangan or jamas (washing) the blade with acid and minerals that
contains arsenic compounds.The process of doing so was kept secret among smiths. Different
types of whetstones, acidic juice of citrus fruits and poisonous arsenic bring out the contrast
between the dark black iron and the light colored silvery nickel layers which together
form pamor, damascene patterns on the blade."

[In Vedic times this sacrifice was performed by kings desirous of offspring; but subsequently it was performed only by kings and implied that he who instituted it, was a conqueror and king of kings. A horse was turned loose to wander at will for a year, attended by a guardian; when the horse entered a foreign country, the ruler was bound either to submit or to fight. In this way the horse returned at the end of a year, the guardian obtaining or enforcing the submission of princes whom he brought in his train. After the successful return of the horse, the rite called Asvamedha was performed amidst great rejoicings. It was believed that the performance of 100 such sacrifices would lead to the attainment of the seat or world of Indra, who is, therefore, always represented as trying to prevent the completion of the hundredth sacrifice. cf.

रुद्र वशि as ्त्र्य -म्बक and अम्बक as 'copper' (reaching Uruk from Araṭṭa). Indus Script copper relief Al'Ubaid (Ur) c. 3100 BCE deciphered http://tinyurl.com/z4d6eas The Sanskrit term Ayas means metal and can refer to bronze, copper or iron.The Rig Veda refers to ayas, and also states that the Dasyus had Ayas (RV 2.20.8). In RV 4.2.17, "the gods [are] smelting like copper/metal ore the human generations".The references to Ayas in the Rig Veda probably refer to bronze or copper rather than to iron.Scholars like Bhargava maintain that Rigved was written in the Vedic state of Brahmavarta and Khetri Copper mines formed an important location in Brahmavarta. Vedic people had used Copper extensively in agriculture, Water purification, tools, utensils etc., D. K. Chakrabarti (1992) argued: "It should be clear that any controversy regarding the meaning of ayas in the Rgveda or the problem of the Rgvedic familiarity or unfamiliarity with iron is pointless. There is no positive evidence either way. It can mean both copper-bronze and iron and, strictly on the basis of the contexts, there is no reason to choose between the two." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_metallurgy_in_the_Indian_subcontinent
In RV 7.59.12 some technical terms can relate to metalwork wealth. मोक्ष emancipation ,
liberation , release from (Monier-Williams); in metallurgical terms, effusion (िराह-वमवहर 's बृहत्
संवहता), or extraction of copper from copper sulphate (RV 7.59.12). मृुत्य is sometimes reckoned among the 11 रुद्र s; वित्योर् विकणय-भासे N. of सामन्s. पुवटं शरीरधनावदविष ां िधय तीवत पुवटिधयनः --is the explanation provided by सा ण | Thus, the explanation provided by Ashutosh Dandekar et al for the rca as extraction of copper from copper sulphate alloy has to be reckoned as a reasonable explanation for the metaphor of tri-ambakam 'three coppers': वत्रऽअम्बकम् । जामहे । सुऽगस्त्वन्धम् । पुवटऽिधयनम् । उिायरुकम्ऽइि । बन्धनात् । मृत्योः । मुक्षी । मा । अमृतात् ॥

रुद्र वशि as ्त्र्य -म्बक and Location of Araṭṭa, a source of copper for Uruk
The association of the word रुद्र with rudh 'red', raudra 'Agni and other divinities' रुद्र or (later on) and Sumerian words such as urud 'copper', loha 'copper-coloured, red' urudu-luh-ha 'refined copper' lead us to review the expression ्त्र्य -म्बक .
Araṭṭa in ancient geography is a tough location to resolve. The following notes evaluate literary evidences and point to Araṭṭa as Lāṭa in the vicinity of Rann of Kutch in an archaeological context. http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2014/01/locating-aratta-with-archaeological.html http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2014/07/locating-aratta-of-ancient-near-east.html http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2014/01/aratta-as-lata.html http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2015/10/aratta-geography-meluhha-vocabulary.html http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2014/01/aratta-as-lata-in-vicinity-of-rann-of.html http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2014/07/tin-road-meluhha-aratta-assur-kanesh.html

ॐ aum We worship, adore, honour, revere, the three-eyed, three-mothered one, sweet
smelling, fragrant, the one who nourishes someone else and gives his life fullness. I am
bound down just like a cucumber (to a vine) Liberate from the bounds of death. Give me
some life rejuvenating nectar. [If three-fold, three-eyed, three
mothered, tryambakam may signify 'three sourced' red ore.]
In RV 7.59.12 ्त्र्य -म्बक is associated with sugandha, 'fragrance'.
Does अम्बक 'copper' smell?
Copper has a strong and characteristic smell. Cause of the smell is still an open, unanswered scientific enquiry.
"smell of iron (free-access article!). There are at least two ways in which iron produces a metallic smell. Firstly, acidic substances are capable of corroding iron and steel, releasing phosphorous and carbon atoms present in the metal or alloy. These can react to form volatile organophosphorous compounds such as methylphosphine (H3CPH2 which have a garlic/metallic odour at small concentrations...In the supporting information for the article (also free-access), the authors describe experiments performed with other metals, including copper: 'In conclusion: 1) The typical “musty” metallic odor of iron metal touching skin
(epidermis) is caused by volatile carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones) produced through the reaction of skin peroxides with ferrous ions (Fe 2+Fe2+) that are formed in the sweat-mediated corrosion of iron. Fe2+ ion containing metal surfaces, rust, drinking water, blood etc., but also copper and brass, give rise to a similar odor on contact with the skin. The human ability to detect this odor is probably a result of the evolutionarily developed but largely dormant ability to smell blood (“blood scent”).'"

Vacspatyam and Sabdakalpadruma provide remarkable elucidations of the
significance of the Rigvedic expression: ्त्र्य --म्बक tryambaka. One explanation is that he

Both the encyclopaedias and Amara explain another expression: त्र्यम्बकसख as a
reference to Kubera. Thus, the word ्त्र्य --म्बक tryambaka is also connected with wealth.
This reinforces the lexical meaning: अम्बक 'copper'. Thus, it is reasonable to suggest
that ्त्र्य --म्बक tryambaka means 'three coppers'. One may be native copper. The second could be arsenical copper with 0.5% arsenic.

A third could be copper carbonate containing copper ores. "Rocks containing copper
compounds (such as copper carbonate) are called ‘copper ore’. Copper is extracted from
copper ore by a series of chemical, physical, and electrochemical processes. Ores can be
classed as ‘high grade’ or ‘low grade’ depending on the percentage of copper compounds
(e.g. copper carbonate) they contain. After mining, the ore is crushed, roasted, smelted
and then electrolysed to extract the copper." http://copperores.blogspot.in/

"Gordon Childe refers to the 'relatively large amount of social labour' expended in the extraction and distribution of copper and tin', the possession of which, in the form of bronze weaponry, 'consolidated the positions of war-chiefs and conquering aristocracies' (Childe 1941: 133)... With the publication of J.D. Muhly's monumental Copper and Tin in 1973 (Muhly 1973: 155535; cf. 1976: 77-136) an enormous amount of data on copper previously scattered throughout the scholarly literature became easily accessible... cuneiform texts consistently distinguish refined (urudu-luh-ha) [cf. loha = red, later metal (Skt.)] from unrefined copper (urudu) strongly suggests that it was matte (impure mixture of copper and copper sulphide) and not refined copper that was often imported into the country. Old Assyrian texts concerned with the import of copper from Anatolia distinguish urudu from urudu-sig, the latter term appearing when

written phonetically as dammuqum, 'fine, good' (CAD D: 180, s.v. dummuqu), and this suggests that it is not just 'fine quality' but actually 'refined' copper that is in question... TIN. In antiquity tin (Sum. nagga/[AN.NA], Akk.annaku) was important, not in its own right, but as an additive to copper in the production of the alloy bronze (Sum. sabar, Akk. siparru) (Joannes 1993: 978)... In some cases, ancient recipes call for a ratio of tin to copper as high as 1: 6 or 16.6 per cent, while other texts speak of a 1:8 ratio or 12.5 per cent (Joannes 1993: 104)... 'there is little or no tin bronze' in Western Asia before c. 3000 B.C. (Muhly 1977: 76; cf. Muhly 1983:9). The presence of at least four tin-bronzes in the Early Dynastic I period... Y-Cemetery at Kish signals the first appearance of tin-bronze in southern Mesopotamia... arsenical copper continued in use at sites like Tepe Gawra, Fara, Kheit Qasim and Ur (Muhly 1993: 129). By the time of the Royal Cemetery at Ur (Early Dynastic IIIa), according to M.Muller-Karpe, 'tin-bronze had become the dominant alloy' (Muller-Karpe 1991: 111) in Southern Mesopotamia... Gudea of Lagash says he received tin from Meluhha... and in the Old Babylonian period it was imported to Mari from Elam...
Abhidhāna Cintāmaṇi of Hemachandra states that mleccha and mleccha-mukha are two of the twelve names for copper: tāmram (IV.105-6: tāmram mlecchamukhamśulvam raktam dvaṣṭamudumbaram; mlecchaśāvarabhedākhyam markatāsyam kanīyasam; brahmavarddhanam variṣṭham sīsantu sīsapatrakam). Theragāthā in Pali refers to a banner which was dyed the colour of copper: milakkhurajanam (The Thera and Theragāthā PTS, verse 965:

Proto-Semitic *ŪRD --- *ŌRD- Indo-European languages
The New Hebrew word " arad " for " bronze" has been based on old Akkadian " urdu" , which would leave it fully Semitic. But it is also supposed that the Babylonians or Akkadians borrowed this word from the Sumerians . There is no certainty on this point though. Anyhow our Table mentions Sumerian . This means that the word "arad" might yet be of Non-Semitic origin .
Quite understandably an internationally known, commercialized and widely used material as copper can have words of the same origin in many languages. It is also understandable that this word is based upon terms developed from words for "earth", as the metal was found in metal-holding earth. In this case , where the root "arad" has the "A + R" in common with other words indicating "earth" and "ore", a Semitic origin seems obvious for Akkadian, or even more a similarity between groups of languages, among which Semitic and Indo European. Sumerian is a language of unknown affinities.
Note:
• Iron, IJzer. The word "ijzer" is Dutch for "iron". In Old English we find "isern", but also "iren" and "isen". This last version is like German "Eisen". Obviously the N that was added in many Germanic tongues, made life difficult for the original R , thus leading to German "Eisen".The origin in Old Germanic would have been "isarna", rather like Gothic "isarn". A hypothesis is that these older words, perhaps best conserved in Dutch "ijzer", after Middle Dutch "iser", are a composition. The first part, "is", meaning "strong" and the second part referring to the less strong already known metal "copper" or "ar". As is known , copper and its alloy bronze, were widely used for the production of arms and tools, before iron became known. The main advantage of iron was that is was adapt for making harder, stronger metal tools and arms. So the new stronger metal may have been named "strong copper", or perhaps in the view of the moment " strong metal".
Note:



32
• Sumerian. There is no agreement among scholars about where to place Sumerian and the Sumerians with regard to Indo-European and Semitic. Anyhow the above mentioned Sumerian word "urud" seems to be well related to both groups.
Note:
• Proto-Semitic.. Only Akkadian "urdu" gives some support for a hypothesis for ProtoSemitic "* ו ר ד , urd = bronze".
Note:
• Latin. The Latin word "aes, gen, aeris = ore, bronze", name given to the first metal that was found and used, is sometimes wrongly seen as derived from a hypothetical older "*aios". This may have been suggested by the existence of Old Indian "á,yas = iron, metal". But the "R" in the genitive "aeris", not present in the nominative in line with common rules in Latin, is part of the original root. Besides this in the Old Indian word the final " S " is not part of the root.
Note:
• Proto-Germanic. One probably must distinguish well between the meanings "ore" , "copper" or "bronze" and "iron". The first one is expressed in words like Dutch "oer" that are very near to words meaning "earth" that have no final dental, as seen in entry E 0282 (Hebrew 0057). Old Norse here has "aurr". But also in words that have a final dental as seen in this entry E 0642 (Hebrew 0058), for example Old Saxon "arut". The name of the well known ore of the bronze age is still seen in the small Scandinavian coins called "öre" that has its sisters in older Dutch "oortje" and Old Icelandic "ørtog". Modern German has "Erz" and Dutch "erts", but these are clearly later developments from the predecessors "er ( long E ) " and "eer". Old English had "ar ( with a long A)", that meant "ore" as well as "copper, brass". Then there also words with a dental like "D" as Old Norse "rauði = red ore", but seemingly indicating iron ore, not copper ore. The word "rauð means anyhow the color "red". See our Note on Indo-European. A probable Proto-Germanic was "*AR", with a long A, meaning "ore" and "earth" and used also to indicate the first metal won from the earth, that is copper with its alloys. Besides this already in ProtoGermanic versions "*UR-" and "*OR-"with long vowels were developed to express specifically "ore" and the copper that was won from it.
Note:
• Indo-European. Russian " р у д а, ruda = ore", the same as Old Church Slavonic and other Slavic languages, points at aSlavic : " RU D-", which is the same root that expresses the color "red". Latin "rauds" indicates a "R U D-" as well. The odd thing is that Latin "rudis" says "raw, rough, not worked". For the words with a " D "-like consonant there is no clarity about their origin.



33
For the words that consist of a vowel or diphthong plus " R " , as seen in the Note on Proto-Germanic, there is little more information. Celtic gives us Old Irish "ur = earth, clay". We have not sufficient material to support the yet rather probable similarity of Indo-European with Proto-Germanic. We refer for this to entry E 0283 (Hebrew 0068). When people discovered that they could win metal from the ground, they based their indications on words for "earth". It is quite possible that Indo-European languages knew a form "Ō R-" as well as a "Ō R D-, with which were indicated grounds from which metals were won. It is hard to establich if this may have been the case for a still undivided original Indo-European, that may have split before metals were won.
Note:
• Gold. The Germanic and Slavic words for "gold" are related. Often we find "S" or "Z" in Slavic where Germanic has "K" or "G". Thus we find Russian "золото (zoloto)" for English "gold". But in Latin we find "aurum", obviously a relative of the root "A R" of this entry. The greater richness of the metal has then as it appears been expressed by the use of a different, more brillant double vowel : "AUR" instead of simply "AER", "AR" or "OR" for copper and the minerals it was found in. Later gold in Latin languages has yet become "oro" , as generally Latin "AU" has become "Ō". [unquote] http://www.de-bruyn.it/english/0058_arad.shtml
“Muhly has thoroughly reviewed the ancient textual sources for the use of copper and its trade in Mesopotamia, with extensive commentary on their relation to known deposits in the area. Archaic texts from Uruk (III) indicate that already by the later fourth millennium BCE Dilmun was engaged in the metals trade. In the third millennium Sumerian texts list copper among the raw materials reaching Uruk from Arata (should read Araṭṭa) and all three of the regions Magan, Meluhha, and Dilmun are associated with copper, but the latter only as an emporium. Gudea refers oblilquely to receiving copper from Dilmun...Magan was certainly a land producing the metal, since it is occasionally referred to as the ‘mountain of copper’. It may also have been the source of finished bronze objects. ”(Peter Robert Stuart Moorey, 1999, Ancient Mesopotamian materials and industries: the archaeological evidence, Eisenbrauns, p. 245)
