“The mystery of Keltic thought has been the despair of generations of philosophers and aesthetes ... He who approaches it must, I feel, not alone be of the ancient stock ... but he must also have heard since childhood the deep and repeated call of ancestral voices urging him to the task of the exploration of the mysteries of his people ... He is like a man with a chest of treasure who has lost the key”

Some Notes on the True Roots and Origin of the Scots

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
Who really are the Scottish peoples? What is their origin? Do tradition, national characteristics and emblems assist? Why are they such great leaders, administrators and inventors? Is there a connection between them and the ancient Biblical tribe of Judah?
Why did the British Empire succeed when other Empires did not? Was it a blessing in fulfillment of prophecies such as that in Gen 12:3? Why were the Scots so influential in the Empire, way beyond their population numbers?
Today book after book; article after article; universities, politicians, social workers spread lies about the British Empire, denigrating it.
It seems that every second movie or television programme is laced with anti-British racism. White men with accents that are clearly English or other British accent, are almost always the ‘baddies’, inculcating hatred for White males and British in among all age groups and particularly the young.
What evil incites such hatred and bitterness? For it is utterly unjustified.
Now that the Empire was destroyed despite the finest efforts by Churchill, the world is a worse place.
But has the world learned its lesson? Does it have the humility to accept that the Empire was overwhelmingly positive and uplifting and light years ahead of any comparative empire during its time and any other in world history? Does the world need the British Empire again? Or is its nemesis, the United Nations, doing a better job at world order than the Empire?
Will the Empire be revived? If so, how?
Some have been proclaiming many rival New World Orders, all competing and hating one another. Yet a New World Order will arise – the one that will be ushered in by Jesus Christ Himself in astonishing fashion. He will set up His people to rule the world for peace, prosperity and order under Him as we shall see.
Lord Curzon stated that:
“The British Empire is under Providence the greatest instrument for good that the world has seen”.
South African Prime Minister General Smuts declared that the Empire was:
“the widest system of organized human freedom which has ever existed in human history”.
Cecil Rhodes could also see that the British Empire should be extended to encapsulate the world. He established the Rhodes Scholarships programme to become a “a society of the elect for the good of the Empire” with the entirety of the African continent coming under British rule. For the British were “the first race in the world, and the more of the world we inhabit, the better it is for the human race”. He even spoke openly of “the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British Empire”.
Such noble dreams were not to be this side of the return of Christ to the earth.

Niall Ferguson in his magnificent work Empire. How Britain made the Modern World asserts:
“The British Empire was the nearest thing there has ever been to a world government. Yet its mode of operation was a triumph of minimalism. To govern a population of hundreds of millions, the Indian Civil Service had a maximum strength of little more than 1,000 ...
“For better or worse – fair and foul – the world we know today is in large measure the product of Britain’s age of Empire.1 [emphasis mine]
In the Conclusion, Ferguson states:
“In truth, the imperial legacy has shaped the modern world so profoundly that we almost take it for granted.
Without the spread of British rule around the world, it is hard to believe that the structures of liberal capitalism would have been so successfully established in so many economies around the world ... India, the world’s largest democracy, owes more than it is fashionable to acknowledge to British rule.”2
Keith Windschuttle, a noted moderate scholar and author confirms that the Empire was positive for the native peoples:
“In short, the transition to independence of a sizable part of the empire was a badly handled mess. Much of the blame for this lies with those critics of imperialism, in both the metropolis and the colonies, who were more concerned to end its rule quickly rather than wisely, and who were even less concerned that the boundaries of several new states saddled them with problems that were unresolvable except by violence. The Oxford history makes clear that, before the rush to disband it, British imperial rule in many parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, while it might not have been representative or democratic, was nonetheless orderly, largely benign, and usually fair. For all their faults, most British colonial officials delivered good government—or at least better government than any of the likely alternatives. The lives of millions of ordinary people in these countries would have been much happier had the British stayed longer, that is, until a more satisfactory path to independence and a more sensible map of territorial boundaries had been drawn up. Indeed, the uncivilized conditions in which many people in the old imperial realm now live is evidence that the world would be a better place today if some parts of it were still ruled by the British Empire.”3 [emphasis mine]
How does this impact upon our quest on the Scots and their origin?
Answer: the Scots are the most inventive people on earth and practically ran the British Empire!4

Some Notes on the True Roots and Origin of the Scots

When one considers the nature and character of the Scots, one is left a little bewildered. How can such a country, so poor and sometimes mistreated, be also the source of the bulk of major inventions and institutions of the entire world? How can these people be such great administrators, leaders and businessmen?
Truly the Scots are an enigma, brother to the English, yet antagonisms naturally persist between these two peoples5. Why?
Books such as
 God’s Frontiersmen. The Scots-Irish Epic;  The Scottish Empire;  When Scotland Ruled the World. The Story of the Golden Age of Genius, Creativity and Exploration;  How the Scots Invented the Modern World: the True Story of How Western Europe’s Poorest Nation Created our World and Everything in it
- are eye-popping revelations as to the incredible capacity of these people.
This paper is neither a chatty work designed for mere reading pleasure. Nor is it written in an academic style. Rather, it is mainly assembling my research and thoughts and presenting them in a fashion for further study and research by others to build upon. Much of my papers on the www.originofnations.org website are written in that fashion.
Further, I don’t like rehashing what others have written. Either my works have to be unique; fill in gaps of other works; or value-add in some way to a doctrine or theory.
That is the way that this paper is presented and I trust will be of benefit to the reader. This article is written from a position that the Scots are primarily descended from Judah, representing a branch of Judah.
We do not discredit other ideas about Lowlander Scottish descent from Manasseh or that the Scots in general descend from Asher or Gad. Most certainly they are not descendants of Chaldeans which Waddell and others assert. However, that there is genetic infusion from other tribes cannot be denied. But overall they are very much Keltic and direct descendants of Judah in the main as this paper sets out to prove.
“How an archipelago of rainy islands off the north-west coast of Europe came to rule the world is one of the fundamental questions not just of British but of world history ... It was not conceived by self-conscious imperialists, aiming to establish English rule over foreign lands, or colonists hoping to build a new life overseas”.6
“What is less clear is why this expansion [of the Empire] occurred. There never was a plan for imperial expansion ... there seemed little need actually to conquer more territory”7
5 Many English used to be quite concerned about the influence of the Scots in the Empire and many stillhold concerns about Scottish influence in the UK. For instance, in 1917 a pamphlet was published titled “The Oppressed English” by Ian Hay, which stated: “Today a Scot is leading the British army in France [Field Marshall Douglas Haig], another is commanding the British grand fleet at sea [Admiral David Beatty], while a third directs the Imperial General Staff at home [Sir William Robertson]. The Lord Chancellor is a Scot [Viscount Finlay]; so are the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Foreign Secretary [Bonar Law and Arthur Balfour]. The Prime Minister is a Welshman [David Lloyd George], and the First Lord of the Admiralty is an Irishman [Lord Carson].” 6 Ferguson 2003: xii, 4

JUDAH
Shelah Zarah Pharez
Er Calcol Darda Jesse
David
ANCIENT JUDAH
To commence this section, we should incorporate an overview of the descendants of Judah via a family tree. Below we trace his immediate descendants who are important to remember in our quest for Judaic migrations.
Note what the scriptures reveal about his descendants in IChron 2:3-15:
“The sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah; which three were born unto him of Shua's daughter the Canaanitess. And Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah; and he slew him. And Tamar his daughter-in-law bare him Perez and Zerah. All the sons of Judah were five. The sons of Perez: Hezron, and Hamul. And the sons of Zerah: Zimri, and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol, and Dara; five of them in all. And the sons of Carmi: Achar, the troubler of Israel, who committed a trespass in the devoted thing. And the sons of Ethan: Azariah. The sons also of Hezron, that were born unto him: Jerahmeel, and Ram, and Chelubai. And Ram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Nahshon, prince of the children of Judah; and Nahshon begat Salma, and Salma begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed, and Obed begat Jesse; and Jesse begat his first-born Eliab, and Abinadab the second, and Shimea the third, Nethanel the fourth, Raddai the fifth, Ozem the sixth, David the seventh.”
Judah’s immediate descendants
What of Judah’s descendants which are listed in the aforementioned family tree? Now, Judah had five sons:
Er, Onan and Shelah born from the daughter of Shuah the Canaanite (Gen 38:2-5). Er and Onan died but Shelah had a son named Er.
The other two sons, Zarah and Pharez, were twins born of Tamar, his daughter-in-law. Pharez means “breach” and is indicates the great rivalry that emerged between the lines of Zarah and Pharez with Pharez gaining the primogeniture per the description in Gen 38:2830 – this will be discussed in more detail later in this paper.
Although Shelah was the firstborn, he was rejected (cp Gen 24:3, 37; Deut 7:1-6; 20:16-18).

Due to the failure of his older brothers and because of his capacity and character, Judah came to be the leader in Israel. From that line comes the Messiah and famous Bible names such as Caleb, Ruth, David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Josiah and Zerubbabel.
“For Judah prevailed among his brothers, and from him came the chief ruler [the royal line of David which includes the Messiah, but also political and military leaders], but the birthright was Joseph’s.” (IChron 5:2)
Why does the account in the Bible extend Zarah’s genealogy only to the third generation? Could it be that they had left the area for Ireland? Were these the Milesians which may have sprung from Mahol
Zarah’s immediate descendants
Note what is revealed in IChron 2:3-15:
“The sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah: which three were born unto him of the daughter of Shua the Canaanitess. And Er, the firstborn of Judah, was evil in the sight of the LORD; and he slew him. And Tamar his daughter in law bare him Pharez and Zerah. All the sons of Judah were five. The sons of Pharez; Hezron, and Hamul. And the sons of Zerah; Zimri, and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol, and Dara: five of them in all. And the sons of Carmi; Achar, the troubler of Israel, who transgressed in the thing accursed. And the sons of Ethan; Azariah. The sons also of Hezron, that were born unto him; Jerahmeel, and Ram, and Chelubai. And Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon, prince of the children of Judah; And Nahshon begat Salma, and Salma begat Boaz, And Boaz begat Obed, and Obed begat Jesse, And Jesse begat his firstborn Eliab, and Abinadab the second, and Shimma the third, Nethaneel the fourth, Raddai the fifth, Ozem the sixth, David the seventh.”
When the tribes of Israel settled down in the Promised Land, Judah occupied the southern regions with Simeon close to Dan, Ephraim and Benjamin. Perhaps, should we locate the Pharez/Zarah branch of Judah today, we might find a similar configuration?
To understand who and what is Judah, we need to examine various key Scriptures pertaining to this tribe, which portray something about its character and role, viz:
Deu 33:7 And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah, And bring him in unto his people. With his hands he contended for himself; And thou shalt be a help against his adversaries.
Jdg 20:18 And the sons of Israel rose and went up to the house of God and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the sons of Benjamin? And Jehovah said, Judah first. [see Deut 33:7]
2Ch 9:8 Blessed be Jehovah your God, who delighted in you to set you on His throne to be king for Jehovah your God. Because your God loved Israel

to establish them forever, therefore He made you king over them to do judgment and justice.
1Ch 29:23 And Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king in place of David his father. And he was blessed, and all Israel obeyed him. [the throne of Judah, through David, is the Lord’s Throne! Woe to those that oppose or deemphasise its importance – they bring curses upon themselves]
Psa 78:67 And He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim; Psa 78:68 but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which He loved. [see IKings 11:36; Zech 8:15] Psa 60:7 Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; and Ephraim is the strength of My head, Judah is My lawgiver;
Psa 108:8 Gilead is Mine; Manasseh is Mine and Ephraim is the strength of My head; Judah is My lawgiver [see Num 21:18; Is 33:22; James 4:12] Psa 114:2 Judah was His sanctuary, and Israel was His kingdom. [see Is 65:9]
What do the aforementioned scriptures tell us? Firstly, that Judah possesses the Royal line or scepter. Secondly, Judah is first among the tribes – this is in leadership capacity and other skills; they are the Lawgiver tribe – excellent at legislation and policy development; and lastly they are associated with God’s sanctuary and religion.
Original location of Judah in the Holy Land
This is where Judah settled. Note the proximity to Dan, Ephraim and Benjamin

What did this tribe look like? What were their racial features and physiognomy? For, if we know that, then by a simple method of deductive reasoning, we might discover who their descendants are.
In lieu of me typing up my own notes, I find that Peter Salemi explains what the tribe of Judah looked like very succinctly:
“All peoples on earth today have descended from Noah's three sons-Shem, Ham and Japheth-as recorded in Genesis 10. (NOTE: By comparing the known geographic origins of the major racial groups with the ancient locations of the biblically listed descendants of Noah's sons, it is possible to determine which son of Noah fathered which major race.) Ham is the father of the Negroids-the dark-skinned peoples who inhabited Africa, India, and, anciently, certain eastern Mediterranean countries like Canaan. Japheth is the father of the Mongoloids-the yellow and brown peoples of Asia and the native Indian tribes of North, Central and South America. Many of the oliveskinned peoples who inhabited the countries of the northern rim of the Mediterranean Sea (e.g. Greeks) are also descendants of Japheth and his sons. Shem is the father of the Caucasoids-the fair-skinned blonds, redheads and brunets who are often called the "white" peoples. So the AngloSaxon-Celts must have descended from Shem. This makes absolutely perfect sense when you realize that the very name of the Caucasian race is derived from the CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS-the area we've been reading so much about! Some, though, have argued that Shem's descendants-including Abraham's descendants (Gen. 11:21-32)-are not white. Yet the Bible clearly describes Abraham and Sarah's descendants as "fair" (Heb. yapheh--Gen. 12:11; 24:16; 26:7; Esther 2:7 KJV). There is a description of Sarah, "In the seventh Dead Sea Scroll, whoever wrote this extolled Sarah's perfection from head to foot and while it was written in prose poem, the description as it appeared in the news media was as follows:
'Her skin was pure white; 'She had long lovely hair; Her limbs were smooth and rounded (her thighs were shapely;) 'She had slender legs and small feet; 'Her hand were slim and long and so were her fingers.' "Unfortunately as far as is known, no description of Abraham appears in the Dead Sea scrolls, but as Sarah's description is that of her racial attributes, one can only conclude that Abraham [being a relative of Sarah, see Gen 20:12] would be identical" (R. Weliland, God's Covenant People, p.340, emphasis added). As a youth, King David (a Jew) was "ruddy and of a fair countenance" (1 Sam. 17:42 KJV). Such words could never be used to describe either Hamites or Japhethites. "Ruddy: red; reddish; of the colour of healthy skin in white-skinned peoples" (Chambers Concise Dictionary, 1988, p. 932). Israel's Nazarites are described as being "purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies" (Lam. 4:7 KJV). What peoples might have "ruby-red cheeks"? These are words that could never apply to darker-skinned peoples. Black, brown, yellow or even olive-skinned Mediterranean-type people could never be called "ruddy in body." What color are the majority of today's ethnic Jews--many of whom live in Russia or New York City? White! Many of them could easily pass for British, Scandinavian or other Nordic European types. Notice this quote by Huxley and Haddon in We Europeans, concerning the few Nordic type people in Germany: "Hence their physique... is identical: fierce blue eyes, red hair (rutilae comae), tall frames.... It may be noted that red hair is rare among modern Germans, save among those of Jewish origin" (p. 36)!
Though some of Shem's descendants are darker because of their intermarriage with darker-skinned peoples, still, it is almost exclusively

among the descendants of Shem-such as the Israelites-that we find lightskinned brunets, red-heads and blonds. Therefore the Celts and Scythian Anglo-Saxons must be descendants of Shem! Another indication of this descent is found in the following quote: "Alfred, king of the Anglo-Saxons [b. 849 A.D.] was... the son [descendant] of Sem [Shem]" (Church Historians of England, vol. 2, p. 443). Notice also: "So the Anglo-Saxons may well have had records of the ancestry of their kings, beginning with Sceaf... and calling Sceaf the son of Noe, born in the Ark, or even identifying him with the Patriarch Shem" (Haigh, Conquest of Britain by the Saxons, p. 115).
This author also says: "The Old Testament book The Song of Solomon appears to confirm this description of Yhshua. Many theologians are convinced that the 'Husband' in this book has a dual fulfillment in both Solomon and, prophetically, in Yhshua [Jesus] the Messiah: 'My beloved [husband] is white and ruddy...(Song of Solomon 5:10 KJV)''' (R. Weiland, p.342, emphasis theirs). This is the same description of David. And since Jesus is a descendant of David and Solomon, its only logical that Jesus looks or resembles David. Publius Lentrelus, a resident of Judea in Jesus Time wrote about Jesus and said that he had "...eyes bright blue..." (ibid., p.341). Just like David! Jesus most likely had reddish or blond Hair, Maybe even freckles? Many writers like the letter to Caesar himself by Pontius Pilate, and "Gamaliel's interview," about Jesus all describe Jesus with light colored hair and eyes, see ibid., pp.340-341. Now also with the Shroud of Turin being proved as genuine, the experts say that the man on the Shroud, who is Jesus is "male Caucasian" (Robert Bucklin M.D., J.D.Las Vegas, Nevada). And that Jesus Had "light blonde hair" (Unlocking the Secrets of the Shroud, p.137, Gilbert Lavoie). Now that we know and will get into more detail about the Scythian and the Celtic people being the exiled Israelites, what did they look like? Dr. Hans Gunther, professor of Berlin University in the 1920's in his book, "Racial Elements of European History, stated, "... ancient writers, such as Polemon of Ilium, Galienos, Clement of Alexandria, and Adamantios, state that the Scythians [Sacae] were like the Kelts and Germans, and describe them as ruddy-fair. The Scythian tribe of the Alans are also described as having a Nordic appearance. Ammianus [c350 A.D.] describes them as "almost all tall and handsome, with hair almost yellow, and a fierce look." This is how the Bible describes the Israelites.)”8
There can be no doubting that the Judahites were Keltic in racial type.
Prolific Jewish researcher and renowned author, Yair Davidy, provides even further proofs:
Shalom, You are saying that on linguistic and racial grounds I must be mistaken? Well, stranger things have happened. I should confess in advance, that you have touched a personal spot here. I have blondish hair that is inclined to red and so this question naturally always interested me. Since King David (who was described as "admoni") is a hero of mine I was naturally always in favor of any explanation that said he may have had a similar hair coloring to my own. [This was perhaps some consolation for not being exactly similar to King David in more important ways!].First of all linguistically: [Genesis 2:7] AND THE LORD GOD FORMED MAN [ha-ADaM] OF THE DUST OF THE GROUND [ha-ADaMaH], AND BREATHED INTO HIS NOSTRILS THE BREATH OF LIFE; AND MAN BECAME A LIVING SOUL.The Hebrew word for man [Adam: Aleph-daleth- mem] is linked to the word for ground [Adamah: Aleph-daleth- mem-heh]. The Hebrew word for red

is edom [Aleph-daleth-vav-mem] and it may be connected to the same root as the words for man and for ground or earth. On the other hand, Iben Shushan in his Concordance says that the word edom meaning red derives from the same root as dam meaning blood, i.e. red like blood. At all events edom does not mean brown. In Hebrew the word for brown is choom. "Admoni" according to the Concordance of Iben Shushan means inclined to red. Both Esau and David were described as "admoni".Concerning the birth of Esau (who was later renamed Edom) it says: [Genesis 25:25] AND THE FIRST CAME OUT RED [admoni], ALL OVER LIKE AN HAIRY GARMENT; AND THEY CALLED HIS NAME ESAU. Regarding David: [1-Samuel 16:12] AND HE SENT, AND BROUGHT HIM IN. NOW HE WAS RUDDY [admoni], AND WITHAL OF A BEAUTIFUL COUNTENANCE, AND GOODLY TO LOOK TO. AND THE LORD SAID, ARISE, ANOINT HIM: FOR THIS IS HE. And again concerning David: [1Samuel 17:42] AND WHEN THE PHILISTINE [Goliath] LOOKED ABOUT, AND SAW DAVID, HE DISDAINED HIM: FOR HE WAS BUT A YOUTH, AND RUDDY [admoni], AND OF A FAIR COUNTENANCE. We see that in one case the King James version says that "admoni" means red and in another two cases that it means ruddy. In Hebrew Literature you can find the word admoni used in all kinds of contexts but in the earliest examples it seems to mean someone who is red-haired. In Jewish popular tradition of both Ashkenazim and Sephardim it is generally accepted that David had red-hair. The word "admoni" usually means someone with red hair but in some cases it can also mean someone who is blond or blond inclined to red. It is often taken as synonymous with the Modern Hebrew slang word "gingi" (from ginger) meaning blond or red haired ... <<Early tradition spoke of the Lost Ten Tribes being in the Scythian area. This has been discussed by Andrew Colin Gow ("The Red Jews. AntiSemitism in an Apocalyptic Age 1200-1600" NY 1995). The Lost Ten Tribes were called "Red Jews" and were described as all having Red Hair. Red Hair in the Middle Ages especially in Germany was considered a negative characteristic and associated with the Jews and with Judas. The Anti-Christ and Judas were depicted as both having red hair and as both coming from the Tribe of Dan. In Germany the Jews were believed to be in league with the devil and to be plotting with the "Red Jews" meaning the Ten Tribes to overthrow Christendom. >> <<T. E. Reed (1952) declares simply that "The frequency of red hair in Britain is only about 4%."& << Reaching even farther back, Michelson (1934) found 435 out of 2,397 male subjects "showed a red component in their hair." That's 18%. <<Subsequent research by others verifies that the proportion of people with any red hair - e.g., ruddy whiskers - hovers between 18% and 20%. << However, Michelson (citation) performed a careful count of the proportion of red hairs in the heads of his subjects. Of 2,361 final subjects (very light hair was excluded), 56 had 50% or more red hairs on the head (2.37%). <<There seems to be a consensus that redheads account for about 4% of the population>> (of Britain). A very High proportion of red-heads amongst Jews were reported in "Galicia" in Eastern Europe. Unconfirmed opinions state that 12% of the Scottish are red-haired and that redhair was especially prevalent amongst the Picts. Red-heads are also common in Ireland, Scotland, Norway and are found in small numbers throughout Europe. Red-heads were also common in the population of ancient Thrace in which we reported entities from Edom to have settled and from there moved to Germany. Some of the Pharaohs had red hair though most Egyptians were darkish. The Egyptians used to sacrifice red-heads. The Egyptian god Seth was described as red-haired and was associated with the Hyksos and with the Land of Canaan. Seth could be considered to sometimes represent Israel in Egyptian thought. Red-hairs used to be associated with Seth. People from the Land of Israel are occasionally depicted as red-haired in Egyptian paintings. Egyptian illustrations of foreign peoples had an element of

12
caricature and ethnic distinctions were emphasized. Red colored hair for Egyptian artists was considered one of the distinguishing characteristics of Semites from the region of Ancient Israel and the Middle east in general. Red-heads however are found in small numbers all over the world. It is a similar phenomenon to albinoism or blond hair. It may be due to genetics interacting with environmental influences. People with red hair have a chance of being related to each other BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY SO. JEWS AND RED HAIR The Jewish Encyclopedia: Article The Jewish Encyclopedia under the heading "Hair": Anthropology: <<Among Jews the color of the hair has attracted special attention because, while the majority have dark hair, there is found a considerable proportion with blond and red hair, as shown by the appended table (No. 1): see Table No. 1: Color of Hair Among 145,380 Jewish School Children. From these figures it is seen that the proportion of dark hair (black and brown) is quite high 66 per cent in Germany, and reaching 76.3 per cent in Hungary. The proportion of fair hair is lowest in Hungary (23.7 per cent) and highest in Germany (32 per cent). In a fair proportion of blond-haired children the hair becomes darker as age advances; it is therefore essential to take observations upon adults. In the appended table (No. 2) are given the results of investigations upon Jews of both sexes and in various parts of the world: see Table No. 2: Color of Hair Among 7,505 Jews. <<Red Hair. The figures in this table show again that dark hair predominates. The percentage of blond Jews varies only slightly, but is greatest in those countries in which the non-Jewish population is blond. Thus in northern Russia (the Baltic Provinces) Blechman found 32 per cent of blonds; in England, according to Jacobs, 25.5 per cent have blond hair. On the other hand, in Caucasia, where the natives are dark, the Jews show 96 per cent of dark hair. The proportion of red hair is also quite high, reaching 4 per cent in some observations. This has been considered characteristic of the Jews by some anthropologists. It appears to be not of recent origin, and was not unknown among the ancient Hebrews (Esau was "red, all over like a hairy garment"; Gen. xxv. 25). Races are also differentiated, more or less, by straight, curly, or woolly hair. Among the Jews the distribution of these varieties of hair is shown in the following table (No. 3): see Table No. 3: Variety of Hair Among Jews. The next table (No. 4) shows that the beard is usually darker than the hair: see Table No. 4: Color of the Beard. By comparing these figures with those in No. 2 it is found that in the beard the proportion of light to dark is much higher. The number of red beards also increases perceptibly.”9
There are times when these people are praised by the other tribes. We see that more and more nowadays with the Scots being lauded and praised for their awesome achievements which are now beginning to be recognized.
Looking at the attributes of Judah in the Bible, we find the following:

9 E-mail to an online discussion forum 20 July 2003. I have read materials from anthropologists and historians on the physiognomy of the Jews. Pickering (1851: xlix) states: “... many Jews may be seen with light hair and beards; and in some parts of Germany the Jews are remarkable for red bushy beards.” 10 Based on surnames alone, about 1/3 of the army of George Washington was Irish with others disguised with Anglicized surnames (according to Yair Davidy in his e-mail newsletter Brit-Am, 27 May 2004). Washington is quoted at Valley Forge as saying: “If all else fails, I will retreat up the valley of Virginia, plant my flag on the Blue Ridge, rally around the Scotch-Irish of that region, and make my last stand for libery amongst a people who will never submit to British tyranny whilst there is a man left to draw a trigger.” Historians now know that his claims (and others seeking independence) against the British were tremendous exaggerations, nevertheless this quote just goes to show what the tribe of Judah was all about.

But he also had faults. After the selling of Joseph into slavery, it seems that dissatisfaction descended upon Judah.
After all, Reuban was weak and vascillating; Levi could not be trusted and was too rigid and intolerant. Simeon was hot-headed and getting into fights. So off he went on his own and stood on his own two feet like a solid pillar.
But he stands faithful and patriotic, standing up for others and even sacrificing himself for them:
When the governor of Egypt accused Benjamin of a crime which he could only purchase his life with slavery, Judah took his place instead:
“For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.” (Gen 44:32-34)
Compare this with Mark 10:42-45:
“But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them. But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.”
Of further interest is that in the camp in the wilderness Judah leads the way! Always full of zeal and of a pioneering spirit, they are out in front, with the other tribes following (whether they realise it or not). The graphic below portrays this leading spirit.

Arrangement of the tribes in the Wilderness wonderings
This tabernacle arrangement demonstrates that Judah is charged with leadership and symbolizes a
“monopoly of national honors, giving the Leah descended priests (who in practice are absorbed into Judah) the exclusive right and privilege of administering the relationship between Jehovah and Israel.”11
Eventually the tribe of Judah went into captivity about 130 or so years after the House of Israel was conquered and enslaved by Assyria. According to Easton's Illustrated Bible Dictionary (article “Captivity”):
“The city [Jerusalem] was spoiled of all that was of value, and then given up to the flames. The temple and palaces were consumed, and the walls of the city were levelled with the ground (B.C. 586), and all that remained of the people, except a number of the poorest class who were left to till the ground and dress the vineyards, were carried away captives to Babylon. This was the third and last deportation of Jewish captives. The land was now utterly desolate, and was abandoned to anarchy.
In the first year of his reign as king of Babylon (B.C. 536), Cyrus issued a decree liberating the Jewish captives, and permitting them to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the city and the temple (2 Chronicles 36:22,23; Ezra 1; 2). The number of the people forming the first caravan, under Zerubbabel, amounted in all to 42,360 (Ezra 2:64,65), besides 7,337 men-servants and maid-servants. A considerable number, 12,000 probably, from the ten tribes who had been carried away into Assyria no doubt combined with this band of liberated captives.

At a later period other bands of the Jews returned (1) under (Ezra 7:7) (B.C. 458), and (2) (Nehemiah 7:66) (B.C. 445). But the great mass of the people remained still in the land to which they had been carried, and became a portion of the Jews of the "dispersion" (John 7:35; 1 Peter 1:1). The whole number of the exiles that chose to remain was probably about six times the number of those who returned.”12 [emphasis mine]
In his famous The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, Edersheim similarly remind us that
“It is the greatest importance to remember that only a minority of Jews returned from Babylon in Ezra’s time.”13
The tribe of Judah was taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar – yet only a tiny remnant returned to the Holy Land. In fact, less than 49,000 returned (Ezra 2:64; Neh 7:66) of hundreds of thousands that went into Babylonian captivity!
Note: only a small percentage of Judah ever returned to the Holy Land. What happened to the rest of the tribe?

MIGRATIONS OF JUDAH
I must confess that many, many years ago I first considered the Highlander Scots as Simeon and the Lowlanders as Judah. But over time I began to notice the Judaic character of the Highlanders as well.
One of my favourite scriptures I like mentioning to folks is Is. 11:13 where Ephraim and Judah vex each other.
“And the envy of Ephraim shall depart, and the foes of Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not trouble Ephraim.” (Is. 11:13) [English and Scots will stop their fighting. Refer to Appendix 2 for a modern example]14
This seems to be a prophecy of English-Scottish conflict and rivalry. Yet, when they cooperated within the United Kingdom (typological of the coming union of Israel predicted in Ezekiel 37), they virtually ruled the world. In fact, together with America, could have ruled the world after World War 2.
Historians unanimously agree that the Scoti tribe came from northern Ireland in skin covered boats forming the kingdom of Dalriada in Argyll. It is from this tribe that the entire nation eventually took its name.
They conquered the Cymric Britons (probably of Levitical stock) and drove out the Picts (probably Canaanites and descendants of Tiras) and, as such, some Scottish tribes became known as Picts as well.
A theory that has been in circulation is that the descendants of Shelah and Er intermarried with the Canaanites/Phoenicians which created an interwoven mixture which was anti-Israel and anti-Judah. It is this group which gave rise, at least in part, to the anti-British Sinn-Fein in Ireland (a name likely derived from Phoenician and Fenian). Their attitude seems to be derived from their forefathers (Num 33:55). Indeed, the region of Spain that the Canaanites/Phoenicians settled in Spain was known in ancient times as Eis Feine.
This is also possibly why Ireland was known as Erin or Erin’s Land, named after Er. Later, Ireland was known as Ierne or Hibernia derived from their ancient forefather, Eber or Heber. The northern islands of Hebrides were originally known as the Heberides and the Irish language as Erse.
To this day southern Ireland is called Eire and the name Shelagh is popular there. According to the website Celtic Female Names of Ireland other derivations are:
“Sile — (SHEE-la) ... Sheela, Sheelah, Sheila, Shelagh, Sheelagh, Shiela, Sheilag, Cicily, Celia, Selia, Sissy”.15
Thousands of years ago the descendants of Er and Shelah were recorded in I Chron 4:2123 as being skilled with pottery, plants, hedges and fine linen. Does this not describe the southern Irish? Everyone knows about Irish Linen, the love the Irishman has for his garden and their Belleek China.
14 “Scots believe they have a better education, a more beautiful country, better natural resources, better whiskey. The English feel a sense of superiority, a pride as the seat of government, a feeling that they can rule the best. Arrogance and prejudice exist on both sides in spite of the number of people who cross the border regularly.” (Schroeder 1992: 2) 15 http://www.crosswinds.net/~daire/names/celtirishfem.html

Shelah and Er his eldest son are today amongst the southern Irish Catholics, forever a thorn in the side of the British.
Is all this mere coincidence? Surely not as we shall see.
In The Jews of Ireland, Louis Hyman noted:
"It is stated in very old copies of The Book of Invasions and other ancient documents that it was the Mosaic law that the Milesians brought into Errin [Ireland] at their coming; that it had been learned and received from Moses in Egypt by Cae Cain Beathach, who was himself an Israelite, who had been sent into Egypt to learn the language of that country by the great master Fenius Farsaith, from whom the Milesian brothers, who conquered Errin, are recorded to have been the twenty second generation in descent; and it is stated in the preface to Seanchas Mord that this was the law of Errin at the time of the coming of St. Patrick".16
Zarah had five sons as we have seen (IChron 2:3-6), but in Gen 46:12 where the descendants of Judah are listed as having accompanied Jacob into Egypt, they are not listed. Why?
“And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I. And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons's daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.” (Gen 46:1-5
“And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.” (Gen 46;12) [Zarah’s sons appear to be not in the group]
“... and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.
And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to show the way before him unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.” (Gen 46:2728) [note the Judaic character – the one leading or pioneering the way. Full of zeal and interest in what lay ahead]
It would seem that they, or some of them, had already migrated out of the region.
16 Hyman 1972: 1. Some professional linguists such as Theo Vennemann has argued for a Semitic substratum in the Celtic languages, although this has not been accepted at this time by most linguists. In a short article Vennemann notes that “The non-Indo-European structural features of Insular Celtic have all been shown by Morris Jones and Pokorny to occur in HamitoSemitic, and by Gensler to form a characteristic bundle of islglosses just of Hamito-Semitic and Insular Celtic.” (Vennemann 2001:1)

It may be that Zarah’s son Calcol (IChron 2:3-6) left the region of Egypt early on in the history of Israel and found their way to Spain where they founded Saragossa (originally Zaragassa = stronghold of Zarah) which is in the Ebro valley of Spain.17
Later they migrated to Ireland or Hibernia – the original name for Ireland, derived from Eber. Reference to Eber may be found in Gen. 11:14 and Num 26:45).
Here Calcol’s descendants settled in Ullader (known as Ulster or Northern Ireland today).
Now remember, it was the hand of Zarah whose wrist had the scarlet thread tied around it and the red hand became a primary heraldic symbol of Ulster to this day. Even in Scotland the symbol was used in the Arms of old families and 14 Clan Chiefs!18
Another son of Zarah was Darda (see IChron 2:6; IKings 4:31). It appears that they may have given their name to the Dardenalles and they were prominent at Troy about 1500BC prior to the Exodus. In other words they were among the Hittite Trojans giving rise to many European Royal Houses.
About 400 years later a descendant of Darda, Brutus of Troy, sailed to Britain and founded New Troy or Londenium (London). Here a branch of the Judahite Royal Throne was established.19
Calcol may have given his name to the Colchis region near the Black Sea.
The History of Britain was written by the historian Nennius in the 8th century in which he evidently has access to ancient records and traditions:
“15. According to the most learned among the Scots, if any one desires to learn what I am now going to state, Ireland was a desert, and uninhabited, when the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, in which, as we read in the Book of the Law, the Egyptians who followed them were drowned. At that period, there lived among this people, with a numerous family a Scythian of noble birth, who had been banished from his country, and did not go to pursue the people of God. The Egyptians who were left, seeing the destruction of the great men of their nation, and fearing lest he should possess himself of their territory, took counsel together, and expelled him. Thus reduced, he wandered forty-two years in Africa, and arrived with his family at the altars of
17 Much information is available on the migration of the Scots from Spain. For instance Thomas Moore in his classic work The History of Ireland (1837) records this history on page 61. Further resources and proofs are available in libraries and on the internet 18 Murray 1984: 15 19 The following is extracted from Raymond F McNair’s booklet King David’s Everlasting Dynasty: “Smith’s Dictionary of the Bible says that Flavius Josephus equates Darda with the Greek Dardanos: “DARDA...Joseph[us] DARDANOS; Darda” (vol. 1, p. 397). “Dardanus...mythical founder of Dardanus on the Hellespont [i.e. the Dardanelles] and ancestor of the DARDANS of the Troad [area ruled by the Trojans]...became the founder of the royal house of TROY” (Ency. Brit., 11th ed., Vol. V11, p. 829). The “Hebrews” built “ancient Troy”! According to Scottish historian John MacLaren, certain Israelites had settled in Asia Minor in ancient times. [Note At that time Western Asia Minor was then inhabited primarily by Greek colonists, but some of those “Greeks” were in fact Israelites who lived among the Greeks]. “The HEBREWS then built an altar to the Lord thanking Him for their deliverance from the Egyptians. The king of Greece visited their camps with his Hebrew servant, telling them to build a city and fortify themselves against their enemies...[they then] commenced to build the city of TROY” (The History of Ancient Caledonia, 1879 ed., p. 4). Furthermore, Josephus and the first book of Maccabees both mention that some Israelites had lived in Southern Greece many years before Christ. He quotes the Spartan King Areus as saying, “We have discovered that both the Jews and the Lacedemonians [of S. Greece] are of one stock, and are derived from the kindred of Abraham” (bk. 12, chap. 4, sec. 10, pp. 296-297). A book entitled Hellosemitica says, “And already Hecataeus of Abdera [c. 4th century B.C.] represented both the Jewish Exodus and the Greek migration of Danaos and Cadmus as episodes of one and the same event.... Thence the assertion...that the SPARTANS (whose kings...claimed descent from Danaos) are brothers of the JEWS and descend from Abraham’s kindred” (Hellosemitica, 1965, p. 98).” (McNair 2006:16-17)

the Philistines, by the Lake of Osiers. Then passing between Rusicada and the hilly country of Syria, they travelled by the river Malva through Mauritania as far as the Pillars of Hercules; and crossing the Tyrrhene Sea, landed in Spain, where they continued many years, having greatly increased and multiplied Thence, a thousand and two years after the Egyptians were lost in the Red Sea, they passed into Ireland, and the district of Dalrieta. At that period, Brutus, who first exercised the consular office, reigned over the Romans; and the state, which before was governed by regal power, was afterwards ruled, during four hundred and forty-seven years, by consuls, tribunes of the people, and dictators. The Britons came to Britain in the third age of the world; and in the fourth, the Scots took possession of Ireland. The Britons who, suspecting no hostilities, were unprovided with the means of defence, were unanimously and incessantly attacked, both by the Scots from the west, and by the Picts from the north. A long interval after this, the Romans obtained the empire of the world. “16. From the first arrival of the Saxons into Britain, to the fourth year of king Mermenus, are computed four hundred and twenty-eigtht years; from the nativity of our Lord to the coming of St. Patrick among the Scots, four hundred and five years; from the death of St. Patrick to that of St. Bridget, forty years; and from the birth of Columcille to the death of St. Bridget four years.” [emphasis mine]
This account differs by 200 years with that of the Declaration of Arbroath regarding the migration from Spain to Ireland. And given that Scythians were not known by that name for over 700 years after the Exodus, there may be a mix-up in the story and, as such, could be a story of the flight from Jerusalem about 586BC instead.20
If Calcol gave his name to the Colchis region by the Black Sea, what other information from the area may be gleaned?
The first we hear about the Iberians is from Hecataeus who wrote in the 500sBC. Alas, his writings have not survived the scourge of time, but Roman and Greek historians refer to him. Hecataeus claims that the Iberians lived in Iberia, Spain. Similarly Herodotus (485425BC) refers to the Iberians in his works on two occasions.
In Book II.163 he connects the Iberia with Tartessus (a city near the straits of Gibraltar in Spain) and mentions them again in Book VII.165.
Theophanes, a companion to Pompey, wrote about a people known as the Iberi that lived in the region. Strabo quotes Theophanes and it is from him that some of his knowledge is preserved (no known original writings of his have been preserved).
In any event, Theophanes tells us that the Iberi had a nobility, soldiers, farmers, priests, towns and markets. The were organised on patriarchal lines and the property of each family was administered by the eldest member.
Could they be connected to the Middle Eastern Haberi or Hebrew Ibri? Did some of them settle in Spain, becoming known as the Iberi in the Iberian peninsula?
Strabo tells us that
“the migration of western Iberians [was] to the region beyond the Pontus [Black Sea] and Colchis.”21
20 Filmer c1970: 2 21 Strabo 1.3.21. I have also read accounts of Canaanites and even Black peoples from the region apparently migrating to Scotland and Ireland before being driven out.



Some Notes on the True Roots and Origin of the Scots

In the 17th century a writer known as Purchas wrote a work Pilgramage (published 1614AD) in which we find the following:
“The Iberians, saith Montanus [a Christian heretic in the 2nd century], dwelt near to Meotis; certain Colonies of them inhabited Spaine and called it Hiberia.”
Meotis was the original name for the Sea of Azov north-east portion of the Black Sea. So it seems from this record, that a part of the tribe migrated into Spain.
A famous old work (known as Gough’s Camden’s Britannia) by William Camden on the history of the British Isles was published in the 18th century which recorded that Calcol migrated out of Egypt to Ulster via Spain.22 He was appointed to be the Clarencieux King-atarms in 1597 and died in 1623.
This work went through many editions and was eventually enlarged by Richard Gough to include further discoveries. He published it in three volumes in 1789 which included maps and copper plates. Further updates led to it being published in four volumes in 1806.
Surely there can be no doubt that the Iberi or the Hibernians were none other than the people descended from Calcol and Zarah. The Leabhar Gadhala (= Book of Conquests) states that these Iberii were the earliest inhabitants of Ireland. Hibernia is the Latin form of Iberne or Erne. The book also refers to descendants of Magog who occupied the land, after the Noahician flood (section 122). Although garbled like so much ancient mythology, the book nevertheless contains truths.
Keating’s famous The History of Ireland similarly relates that Mongoloids were amongst the earliest settlers in the isles after the flood known as the Partholanians and later the Nemedians.23 They were followed by Hamites (the Fomorians – probably descendants of Canaan). The ancient Annals of Clonmacnois confirms this who claims that the Fomorians were:
“descended from Cham, the sonne of Noeh, and lived by pyracie and spoile of other nations, and were in those days very troublesome to the whole world.”24
The Giant’s Gateway in Ireland (Cloch-an-na-bh-Fomharigh = causeway or stepping-stones of the Fomorians) was identified with giants and hence is also known as the “Giant’s Causeway”.
After them arrived the White Celtic Fir-Bolgs and finally the Tuatha De Danaan who brought the Lia Fail or Stone of Destiny.25 In the ancient Book of the Genealogies by MacFirbis,
“Every one who is white (of skin) and brown (of hair), bold, honourable, daring, prosperous, bountiful in the bestowal of property, wealth, and rings, and who is not afraid of battle or combat: they are the descendants of Milesius in Erinn “...Every one who is black-haired, who is a tattler, guileful, tale-telling, noisy ... the disturbers of every council and every assembly, and the promoters of discord among the people, these are the descendants of the Firbolgs.”26
22 Gough Camden's Britannia 1789 23 Keating 1908:124 24 quoted in Westwood 1985: 270-75, 289 25 ibid: 130-31 26 Quoted in Heron 1898: 6



Some Notes on the True Roots and Origin of the Scots

According to “The Story of the Irish Race” on the website www.ireland.org
“The Irish race of today is popularly known as the Milesian Race, because the genuine Irish (Celtic) people were supposed to be descended from Milesius of Spain, whose sons, say the legendary accounts, invaded and possessed themselves of Ireland a thousand years before Christ.
The races that occupied the land when the so-called Milesians came, chiefly the Firbolg and the Tuatha De Danann, were certainly not exterminated by the conquering Milesians. Those two peoples formed the basis of the future population, which was dominated and guided, and had its characteristics moulded, by the far less numerous but more powerful Milesian aristocracy and soldiery. All three of these races, however, were different tribes of the great Celtic family, who, long ages before, had separated from the main stem, and in course of later centuries blended again into one tribe of Gaels three derivatives of one stream, which, after winding their several ways across Europe from the East, in Ireland turbulently met, and after eddying, and surging tumultuously, finally blended in amity, and flowed onward in one great Gaelic stream.
The possession of the country was wrested from the Firbolgs, and they were forced into partial serfdom by the Tuatha De Danann (people of the goddess Dana), who arrived later. Totally unlike the uncultured Firbolgs, the Tuatha De Dannann were a capable and cultured, highly civilised people, so skilled in the crafts, if not the arts, that the Firbolgs named them necromancers, and in course of time both the Firbolgs and the later coming Milesians created a mythology around these.
In a famed battle at Southern Moytura (on the Mayo-Galway border) it was that the Tuatha De Danann met and overthrew the Firbolgs. The Firbolgs noted King, Eochaid was slain in this great battle, but the De Danan King, Nuada, had his hand cut off by a great warrior of the Firbolgs named Sreng. The battle raged for four days. So bravely had the Firbolgs fought, and so sorely exhausted the De Dannann, that the latter, to end the battle, gladly left to the Firbolgs, that quarter of the Island wherein they fought, the province now called Connaught. And the bloody contest was over.
The famous life and death struggle of two races is commemorated by a multitude of cairns and pillars which strew the great battle plain in Sligo - a plain which bears the name (in Irish) of "The plain of the Towers of the Fomorians". The Danann were now the undisputed masters of the land. So goes the honoured legend.” [emphasis mine]
Further details are contained within Appendix 12.
Ancient Roman historian, Ammianus Marcellinus wrote of a Gaelic tribe in Ireland “Scoti-per diversa vagentes” which described their wondering and pirate ways. They entered the British Isles several hundred years prior to Christ.
A Gaelic tribe was known as Syths and the Welsh historian, Gildes, for instance, records “the Skythic Vale” which the Clyde and Forth rivers originate. Another area they occupied is the Isle of Skye which later became known as Sgia or Syiath.



Some Notes on the True Roots and Origin of the Scots

In Gaelic it is known as “An t-Eilean Sgiathanach” and later as Scotia. The Scots were also known as Scithae, Scitae, Scuitae and Scotae to the old writers.27 Indeed, as the Greeks called the Scythians Skuthes, this should give us some clue as to the place from whence they made their way to northern Britain: the lands of the western Scythians in parts of western Russia exactly where the Israelites migrated to.
Other names for the early Scots included Picts (Cruithne = “painted men”) and Caledonians. While the earliest settlers in the area after Noah’s flood were also known as Picts who were Mongoloids, they were defeated and driven out by the incoming Scots. As such, they appropriated the name of the Picts (this often happens in history).28
Some helpful information on the variations amongst the Scots are discussed in the anthropological work The Origin and Distribution of Racial Types in Scotland by John Brownlee, M.D., D.Sc. The earliest peoples that settled the land were Mediterranean by race (ie Canaanite or even perhaps descendants of Tiras). Brownlee says that were represented by peoples extant in North Africa such as the Berbers or even northern Greece and Asia Minor!29
Scotland has a mix of fair and light eyes; red hair and any coloured eyes; dark hair and eyes – yet there is no significant difference in the cephalic index or stature of the aforementioned indicating a mainly composite ethnic group with much less external genetic infusion than was once thought. Although over the centuries there has been some intermarriage between the Scottish ruling classes and the northern French ruling classes and later the English ruling classes.
To this day the Celtic-Gaelic portion of Scotland is the foundational ethnic component of the nation. There are also infusions of Anglian (Ephraim and Manassah) in the south; Norse (Benjamin) in parts of the north; Danish in the islands off the north coast. However, Celtic remains dominant.
In 1609 many Scots returned to northern Ireland and southern Irish were replaced in the Great Plantation as it became known.
Another branch of Judah may have been the Jutes which overran Kent, whom it is thought, were the descendants of the deportees under Sennacherib about 705-681 BC.
Now that we have located the tribe of Judah in general, let us discover their royal line. Could it be true that the European royalty, and in particular the British Royalty descend from Judah himself?
We shall find out in the following section.
(further information in addition to that contained in this chapter may be found in Appendix 5)
27 “According to “The Descent of the Gaels” by James Grant, and Edinburgh Advocate, and published in 1814, the early Scots were known as Scyths. That, according to Grant, was the confirmed opinion of such old Roman writers as Radulphus, Claudian, Isidore and others. This particular Gaelic branch of the Celtic incomers is supposed to have come direct to Scotland through Scandinavia, and acquired the designation of Scyths because they were nomads, wanderers, without a settled home” (McCormick c1960: 2-3) 28 This is explained in Laing 1990 29 Brownlee c1920: 10

BRITISH ROYAL THRONE
According to the website www.scotlandroyalty.org, the royal families of Europe believe in their Davidic roots:
“Royal Families of Europe
Genealogy on Royal families can sometimes be a confusing and difficult task to undertake. The good thing is that most of the genealogical records kept on the various families are quite excellent and have been researched by the finest Genealogists found anywhere in the world. Queen Victoria spent over a million English pounds to have her lineage put down on paper.
Most of the European Royalty is directly traceable to Biblical times, as a matter of fact many of the European Royal families claim in some way to be directly descended from King David son of Jesse and the Royal house of Judah. Hebrew genealogy which is the finest in the world, is traceable over 6000 years! I have researched my own family ties to the Royal House of David, which is through two of his sons. His sons Nathan, and Solomon. So in fact King David was my 68th Great Grandfather!
These are by far not my only ties to Ancient Israel, but they are certainly among the more well known and interesting of lineages contained among people of Hebrew descent.
There is much to be said of what is known as Biblical Genealogy. However, most of what has been presented to the public has not been presented by genealogists whom do extensive research on Hebrew lineage.
Much of the Gentile world embraces the ideal that their European Royal Families descend from King David in some way, however most claimed lineages are based on conjecture and myth. There are however some very interesting truths to be gleaned from the records of lineage of those individuals whom are descended from several unique families found in less well known Royal Families.
All of the current English Monarchy bases its supreme rule on the premise that they descend from King David; this is indeed why the 3 lions are on the English Royal crest, as the symbols of the Lion of Judah. (Genesis 49:8)” [emphasis mine]

The Coronation Chair (St Edward’s Chair)
One of the best papers ever written on the subject is The Throne of Britain: Its Biblical Origin and Future.30 It is HIGHLY recommended reading and available for free on the internet. You can also read more about the British Royal Throne in works such as Britain’s Secret Identity.31
Until 1999, the Stone has sat in the lower portion of the coronation chair. By decree by the Queen, is has been returned to the Scots. However, it has been stipulated that it must be returned for the next Monarch’s coronation ceremony.
Of course, the last time that a crowning was performed was for Queen Elizabeth II herself. The stone weighs over 300 lbs and is about 26” long, 16” wide and 10.5” deep.
The Stone in Scotland
Scripture records a breach between Zarah and Pharez. From Pharez came the line of kings that are recorded as having ruled Israel in the Old Testament including the famous King David.
After the Kingdom of Israel split between the northern 10 tribes and southern 2, the Davidic line did not cease but was still ruling over the southern tribes.
When the northern tribes were taken into terrible captivity by the Assyrians, many of Judah including the Royalty went into captivity with them (IIKings 18:13-16).
These may have become known as the Jutes who occupied the Danish peninsula at one stage.
To this day, Devenish Island off western Scotland shows the ancient traditional Jeremiah’s Tomb to visitors and tourists. And those traveling north of Dublin may find the area of Tara, north of Dublin in County Meath, where Tamar Tephi was interred.
For centuries the Kings and Queens – unitil 513AD followed by those of Scotland – until 1296AD - were crowned on the stone, believing in the old saying that “wherever the Stone is found the Scottish race will reign”. Edward I of England appropriated the stone in 1296AD, placing it in the coronation chair in Westminster Abbey. Three centuries later, James I of Scotland became the King of England, crowned on this stone! Their national records were also removed to London and in this way, Edward attempted to show that he had annexed the Scottish lands.

The Scottish resisted and after they were victorious over the English in 1316AD at Bannockburn, they hoped to be left in peace. But the English king continued the fight and events led to Robert the Bruce (1274-1329AD)32 and later the Scottish nation being excommunicated by the Pope. In turn, they formulated the Declaration of Arbroath or Independence (1320AD) which is fully laid out in appendix 3 . It is now conceded that this famous Declaration became a model for the American Declaration of Independence.
Was not this Declaration centuries ahead of its time? For it establishes that the King could be forced out of power if he did not uphold the freedoms of the people!
Jacob’s Pillar
I now quote extensively from a famous book Jacob’s Pillar by Raymond Capt. It is difficult to better his research:
"The modern part of the story from Westminster back to Ireland, rests on a succession of well authenticated Irish, Scottish and English historical documents which may be regarded as practically undisputed. Writers on the subject, quoting from such works as The Chronicles of Eri, The Annals of the Four Masters, The Annals of Clonmacnoise, etc., locate the Stone originally at Tara, County of Meath, Ireland. Naturally, such early records as these are uncertain as to dates, but from the "MS Cambrensis Eversus" (by Dr. Lynch), published in Latin in 1662 and translated in 1848, the year circa 584 B.C. may be taken as the Tara starting date.
"Scota was one of the earliest names of Ireland - so named, it was said, from Scota, the "daughter of the Pharaoh" one of the ancient female ancestors of the Milesians. These people were commonly called "Scotti" or "Scots," both terms being frequently used by early Latin historians and poets. ...
"The Chronicles of Scotland by Hector Boece (translated into Scottish by John Bellenden, 1531), tell us ... the story of Gathelus, recording that he left Egypt with his wife (Scota), his friends and a company of Greeks and Egyptians rather that "to abyde ye manifest wengenance of goddis" (reference to "God's" judgment on the remnant that had fled to Egypt to escape Nebuchadnezzar) and, traveling by sea (Mediterranean), after, "lang tyme he landit in ane part of Spayne callit Lusitan" (later called Portingall). After ... peace having been secured, "Gathelus sittand in his chayr of merbel within his citie."
"This chair of "marble" had such fortune and omen that wherever it was found in any land the same land "shall become the native land of the Scots": ...
"The Scots shall brook that realm as native ground "if words fail not, where'er this chair is found."
"It should be noted that The Students English Dictionary defines "marble" as "any species of calcareous stone susceptible of a good polish." It is reasonable to assume the "marble chair" referred to was the Coronation Stone or the Bethel Stone, still in the hands of the sons (descendants) of Jacob when in the care of Gathelus and his Queen Scota.
"Many of the ancient Irish records, when making reference to an "eastern king's daughter," also mention an old man; "a patriarch, a saint, a prophet," called "Ollam Fodhla" and his scribe-companion called "Simon Brug, Brach,

Breack, Barech, Berach," as it is variously spelled. Reportedly, they carried with them many ancient relics. Among these were a harp, an ark or chest, and a stone called, in Gaelic, "Lia-Fail (pronounced Leeah-Fail), meaning "Stone of Fate" or "Hoary of Destiny."
"Tradition asserts that Ollam Fodhla was none other than Jeremiah, the prophet; that the king's daughter was the heir of Zedekiah, the last king of Judah. Simon Brug (Baruch) was Jeremiah's scribe who figures prominently in Biblical history, and the harp was the one belonging to King David. The ark or chest was the Ark of the Convenant. Finally, that the stone, "Lia Fail" was the stone that Jacob anointed with oil at Bethel. ...
"There are many other variations of the story of the Stone being brought from Egypt to Ireland, which when added together present us with a rather confused story. This is understandable when it is realized that the Irish records are compilations at a late date of very early tribal histories. Each of these, written in a tongue difficult to translate, gives its own aspect of the one great story. However, they all agree in the following: The Stone, known as the "Stone of Destiny," came from Spain, and before that, from Egypt, It came in the company of an aged guardian, who was called "Ollam Folla (Hebrew words that mean "revealer," or "prophet"). Eochaidh (Eremhon) with his Queen Tea Tephi was crowned King of Ireland upon the Stone which remained at the Palace of Team-hair Breagh. It was the Coronation Stone of every "Ard-Righ" (High King) of "Eireann" for a period of about 1040 years.
"There is manifestly a mystery surrounding the burial of Tea Tephi. The great "Mergech", the name given the tomb of Tephi was once thought to be Celtic, but is now known to be Hebrew and significant. It designates a place of deposit for treasures, secrets, mysteries, etc. Considering the treasures: Ark of the Covenant, Title Deeds to Palestine and various other relics or Hebrew marks of identity that Jeremiah could have had in his custody, the explicitness with which this tomb of Tephi is described is noticeable. Jeremiah 32: 13-44 records "evidences" which God directs Jeremiah and Baruch to bury.
"The actual burial site of Tea Tephi is unknown today. However, the author has seen a stone at Tara with significant markings which suggests that it marks the grave-vault of Ireland's first Queen of the Davidic line. Perhaps, in due time, the grave will be opened and the royal harp along with other relics will provide the evidence to convince all that God kept His Covenant with David. II Sam. 7:13).
"Tradition has it that the Harp of David was brought to Ireland by Jeremiah and is buried with Tea Tephi at Tara. It is a significant fact that the royal arms of Ireland is a representation of the Harp of David, and has been such for 2500 years. This first mention of the Harp is found in the Dinn Leanches, by Mac Awalgain (B.C. 574)."33
Capt quotes the following:
"The Coronation Stone that reposes in St. Edward's Chapel in Britain's sacred Abbey of Westminster [it has now been given back to Scotland] has stirred men's imaginations for centuries. In light of Bible history no other inanimate object on earth has been given such honored use and glorious purpose as that given to this block of sandstone known as the "Stone of Destiny". What is its origin? What enshrines it with an importance far beyond its intrinsic value?
33 Capt 1977: 32



Some Notes on the True Roots and Origin of the Scots

"In his essay on Certain Monuments of Antiquity, Weaver says (p. 118):
"It appears that the Irish kings, from very ancient times until A.D. 513, were crowned upon a particular sacred stone called 'Liath Fail', 'the Stone of Destiny', that, so also, were the Scottish kings until the year 1296, when Edward I of England brought it here. And it is a curious fact that this stone has not only remained in England unto now, and is existing still under the coronation chair of our British sovereigns in Westminster Abbey, but that all our kings, from James I, have been crowned in that chair. This being a fact so curious, we shall quote its particulars in a note taken from Toland, in his History of the Druids (pp. 137-9)."
"Toland's statement is this:
"The Fatal Stone (Liag Fail) so called, was the stone on which the supreme kings of Ireland used to be inaugurated, in time of heathenism on the hill of Tarah; it was superstitiously sent to confirm the Irish colony in the north of Great Britain, where it was continued as the coronation seat of the Scottish kings ever since Christianity; till in the year 1300 (1296 A.D.). Edward I, of England brought it from Scone, placing it under the coronation chair at Westminster, and there it still continues. I had almost forgot to tell you that it is now called by the vulgar, Jacob's stone--as if this had been Jacob's pillow at Bethel!".
"Dean Stanley, one-time custodian of the Stone, in his book Memorials of Westminster Abbey, sums up its historical importance in these words; 'It is the one primeval monument which binds together the whole Empire. The iron rings, the battered surface, the crack which has all but rent its solid mass asunder, bear witness of the English monarchy--an element of poetic, patriarchal, heathen times, which, like Araunah's rocky threshing floor in the midst of the Temple of Solomon, carries back our thoughts to races and customs now almost extinct; a link which unites the Throne of England to the traditions of Tara and Iona' (2nd Edit. pg. 66).
"In appearance the rugged surface of the Stone of Destiny is of a steely dullpurplish color, varying somewhat, and with some reddish veins. It is composed of calcareous sandstone and imbedded in it are a few pebbles; one of quartz and two others of a dark material (porhyrite or andesite?). Its shape is roughly "pillow-like" being about 26" in length; 16" in. width, and 10 1/2" in depth. Across its surface runs a crack and some chisel-marks are still visible on one or two sides. It appears to have been in the process of being prepared for building purposes, but was discarded before being finished. There are two large iron rings (of some rust resistant alloy), one at each end of the Stone which hang loosely from eyes, made of similar metal let into the Stone.
A description of the chisel-marks is, "The Stone has only one inscription, best described as a Latin cross, which gives no clue to the Stones heritage."
"The rings in the ends of the Stone would indicate that porter poles were once used to transport the Stone. At first, it would appear as if two poles were used, one of them passed through the ring at each end, so that four persons would be required to carry it. However, when turned up, these rings protrude above the top of the stone, enabling one pole to be passed through both rings across the top of the Stone, theoretically allowing it to be carried by only two persons.
"In preparation for King George V's coronation, the Stone was temporarily removed from the Coronation Chair, and a photograph was taken of it. This photograph disclosed that a groove runs right across the stone from ring to



Some Notes on the True Roots and Origin of the Scots
30
ring. From its appearance this groove was not cut, but was clearly the result of friction from a single pole being passed across from ring to ring. Such an indentation and wearing away of material indicates the enormous amount of carrying that the Stone was subjected to. If, as it appears, a single pole was used, because of the weight of the Stone (about 336 pounds) it is probable that more than two persons actually carried the Stone. Yoke-like cross beams could have been attached to both ends of the pole for the convenience of two or more persons at each end of the pole.
"British, Scotch and Irish records of the Stone of Destiny locate it at Tara, Ireland (some five centuries before Christ), from where it was transported to Scotland in circa A.D. 498 by Fergus the Great. From there it was taken to Iona circa A.D. 563; then to Dunstaffnage from where it was removed to Scone, near Perth, Scotland. Finally it was moved, by Edward I, to Westminster Abbey, London in A.D. 1296. Thus, from Tara to Westminster, covering over 1800 years of history, it was never carried to any appreciable extent. The mere removal from these places could not account for the wearing away of the Stone that was evidently caused by the friction of a pole used in constant carrying. This must have been the result of many months of continuous carrying, prior to its arrival in Tara. The story of its journeying from Bethel, in the time of Jacob, and its accompanying the children of Israel in the Wilderness, would account for its present condition.
"One of the most significant facts about the Coronation Stone is that no similar rock formation exists in the British Isles. Professor Totten, the eminent professor of Science at Yale University, after making a thorough examination of the Stone made the following statement: "The analysis of the stone shows that there are absolutely no quarries in Scone or Iona where-from a block so constituted could possibly have come, nor yet from Tara". Professor Odlum, a geologist (and Professor of Theology at an Ontario University), also made microscopic examinations of the Coronation Stone, comparing it to similar stone from Scotland (including Iona and the quarries of Ireland) and found them dissimilar.
"Professor Odlum became tremendously interested in the Stone. He was intrigued with the idea that perhaps its source could be found in Palestine, as suggested by the ancient records of Ireland. Determined to make the search, and after several weeks of unsuccessful exploration, Odlum discovered a stratum of sandstone near the Red Sea at Bethel, geologically the same as the Coronation Stone. Relating the circumstances of the discovery to a friend upon his return to Britain, the Professor stated:
"I put on my old mackintosh, I stuck my geologist's hammer in my pocket, and I went out for one last look. It was pouring rain. I walked along the same places I had walked over and over again, looking for stone. Suddenly, while I was walking along a certain pathway, with a rocky cliff on either side, the sun shone on the rain-streaked piece of rock, and I noticed a peculiar sort of glitter that I thought I recognized. I climbed up, and I found that wet rock, as far as I could see with the magnifying glass I had, was of the identical texture I had been looking for." I chipped off a piece from the living rock. I took it back to the hotel and examined it as well as I could. I was sure I had got what I wanted".
"Although a microscopic test of the sample Bethel stone matched perfectly with the same test made of the Coronation Stone, the Professor wanted to make chemical tests of both stones. to dispel all doubts as to the source of Britain's treasured relic. To save time, Odium cabled a geologist friend in England and said:

31
"Will you do all you possibly can to get a piece of the Coronation Stone no bigger than a pea, in order that we may submit it to a chemical test." The geologist friend made application to the Dean of Westminster Abbey to be allowed to take a piece, no bigger than a pea, from the Coronation Stone. The Dean said: "I daren't let you have permission. The only way you can get permission would be from the Archbishop of Canterbury."
"Application was made to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and this was the reply of the Archbishop: "To take a piece from that stone no bigger than a pea would require a special Act of Parliament to be passed by the House of Commons, endorsed by the House of Lords and signed by the King; and if you get that," said the Archbishop, "I won't give you permission."34
A recent work on the subject of the stone of scone notes:
"A song about the Stone was composed in England, probably shortly after the death of Edward I in 1307. In this it is stated that Scota, Pharaoh’s daughter, brought the stone directly from Egypt to Scotland, to a place close to Scone. Twenty years later William de Rishanger offered further elaboration when he wrote that [Scottish King] John Balliol sat on ‘the royal stone which Jacob placed under his head when he was going from Beersheba to Haran’".35
The Stone of Scone today
Finally, one researcher presents us with further information:
“For some time I'd been wondering: why, if the Stone of Scone (Lia Fail, Stone of Destiny, whatever) really came from the high place where Jacob slept near Bethel, it is composed of sandstone and not limestone? Limestone is the rock out of which the hill country of central Israel and Judah is made. Sandstone is found much deeper in the ground (so deep that you have to get down toward the Jordan or the Dead Sea to find it, or further south in the Negev). Readers with retentive memories of various versions of =The US&BC In Prophecy= and other sources (like lectures by Raymond F.

McNair) will recall that the Stone of Scone is made of "purple calcerous sandstone", and that there have been reports of similar sandstone near the Dead Sea in the land of Moab. But why drag a 300-pound rock all the way from there to Bethel (then Luz)? Is there an outcropping of sandstone in the area that isn't normally remarked on? Even Dr. David Livingston, archaeologist at the Associates for Biblical Research who has dug much in the area of Bethel, told me such an outcropping would be most unusual. He personally didn't seem to know of any. Well, I'd like to cite for you an old letter (dated December 21, 1991) written to me by E. Raymond Capt on the subject, when I asked him about this very thing. I cite the letter exactly as I received it, spelling errors and all.
(...) There is several outcropping of sandstone among the limestones near Bethel. My authority is George Thompson of Glastonbury who also showed me the laboratory reports on tests they did on samples of the sandstone from Bethel and samples from England and Scotland. They also did microscopic photos of the samples of which I have copies. Their verdict – as near as I can remember what was written was – (When comparing them with samples taken directly from the Stone of Destiny by the mason in Scotland when dowels were installed between the two pieces of the stone before given back to England by the Scots) The sample (from Bethel) is closely related in time and space as that from the (Coronation Stone) The laboratory did not know what samples came from where – they were only numbered for them. (...)”36

Is the Throne of David still with us today?
David was a man after God’s own heart (ISam. 13:14). Because he was a man with a tender conscience toward his Creator, God made a separate and distinct covenant with him in addition to the one He had made with Israel. When David wanted to build a house for God, He sent a message to David through the prophet Nathan:
“When your days are fulfilled and you rest with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for My name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his Father and he shall be My son. If he commits iniquity, I will chastise him with the rod of men and with the blows of the sons of men. But My mercy shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I removed from before you. And your house and your kingdom shall be established forever before you. YOUR THRONE SHALL BE ESTABLISHED FOREVER” (2 Samuel 7:12-16).
This promise is again repeated in Psalm 89:
“I have make a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, Your seed [dynasty – Moffatt] will I establish for ever and build up your throne to all generations” (verses 3-4).
So far as the world knows the last king to sit on the throne of David was Zedekiah of Judah when the Babylonians conquered Judah and took them off captive to the land of Babylon about the year 586 BC. The throne of David was never restored when the Jews returned to the land of Palestine after their captivity.
36 J Wheeler, e-mail posted on an internet forum, 20 April 2003. More detailed information can be found in Raymond McNair’s booklet From Jerusalem to London! (page17)
37 It should be noted that one theory exists that when the Scots stole the Stone it was not the original that was returned, but a fake (this may account for the rock type being similar to that found in Scotland). Who knows. See “Stone me it’s a fake,” Highlander Web magazine; “On this day in 1996 the Stone of Destiny was finally returned to Scotland,” British Monarchist League 2012; “Stone of Destiny is fake, claims Alex Salmond,” www.telegraph.co.uk

God promised to David that his throne would last to all generations or FOREVER. If God has not failed to keep His word we need to look for David’s throne (incredibly described as the throne of the Eternal in IChronicles 29:23) elsewhere than the land of Palestine where the Jewish state of Israel is today.
When Judah was taking by Babylon into captivity Nebuchadnezzar killed Zedekiah and all his sons (Jer. 37:1-9), seemingly destroying the royal dynasty. Former King Jeconiah (Jehoiachin) was at that time, in the dungeons of Babylon and he had sons to continue David’s line. It was through his line of descendants that Jesus Christ was born (Matt. 1:1216). God decreed the following about Jeconiah:
“Thus saith the Lord, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, SITTING UPON THE THRONE OF DAVID, AND RULING ANY MORE IN JUDAH”! (Jer. 22:30).
As far as the throne of David was concerned he was childless. God had determined that none of his children would ever occupy the throne. However, God’s commission to the prophet Jeremiah was to be:
“over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out and to pull down, and to destroy and to throw down, to build, and to plant” (Jer. 1:10).
God would use him to help keep the royal line alive and plant it in another land. Nebuchadnezzar did not kill the King Zedekiah's daughters who escaped with Jeremiah (Jer. 43:5-7, Isa. 37:32-33). It would be through one of the daughters of Zedekiah that God would keep the throne of David alive. What land did God lead them to? In Ezekiel 17 God says:
“I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop it from the top of his young twigs a tender one [a daughter] and will plant it upon a high mountain [nation] and eminent. In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit (verses 22-23).
God directed them to northwest Europe (Isa. 49:12) to where the House of Israel had migrated to.

The transportation of the Stone of Scone from the Near East to the British Isles
One work well worth studying is Professor Megalommitis’ paper “Elizabeth II on the Throne of David and Solomon”, published in Origin of Nations magazine (details below).
You can also read a fascinating account of the “Spiritual Significance of the Coronation” in chapter 11 of Brian Williams’ book Britain’s Royal Throne. Williams explains the following steps in the coronation ceremony in detail:
 The Preparation  The Entrance into the Church  The Recognition  The Oath  The Presenting of the Holy Bible  The Beginning of the Communion Service  The Anointing  The Presentation of the Spurs and Sword  The Investiture  The Putting on of the Crown  The Benediction  The Enthronement  The Homage  Te Deum Laudamus hymn  The Recess
Further information and beautiful pictures are contained in John Fox’s The World’s Greatest Throne. In fact, many decades prior to the modern rise of British-Israelism, an article appeared in the London Sun newspaper in June 1837, at the time of Queen Victoria’s coronation:
“This chair, commonly called St. Edward’s chair, is an ancient seat of solid hardwood, with back and sides of same variously painted, in which the Kings of Scotland were in former periods constantly crowned ... Between the seat and this board is enclosed a stone, commonly called Jacob’s, or the fatal

marble stone ... History relates that it is the stone whereon the patriarch Jacob laid his head in the plains of Luz.”38
Although various royal lines are jealous of each other and in continuous contention, when Christ returns He shall take over the throne of David that God has continued to preserve since the days of His promise to King David (Luke 1:32, Gen. 49:10) and all contention will cease.
It is then that we shall find the final conclusion to the “Lord’s Throne” with the Messiah Himself claiming and sitting upon it in glory and authority. Under Him will reign the saints, Israel and the physical descendants of Judah, including those of royal blood.

The Kingly Line of Judah
The constitutional monarchy (= crowned republican) system of government has many benefits which has been explored in detail in several works. The Book of Royal Lists Peregrine Worsthorne’s list of ten blessing of constitutional monarchy:
 Focus for national unity  Long stop in the event of some threat to the constitution  Symbol of national continuity  Excuse for pageantry, ritual and ceremony  Model of family life as it ought to be lived  Focus for the loyalty of the armed forces, who owe allegiance to theCrown  Wins foreign admiration for Britain  Attracts foreign tourism  Induces humility in politicians  Political wisdom and experience
Apparently some Masons (but only a very small minority) also believe in the Davidic origin of British Royalty. Like all Biblical doctrines, many have acquired them and then put a twist on them. It appears that the anti-RCC, pro-Protestant faction of some European ruling classes, brought this idea into the Masonic movement. The BI belief of many (but not all) Masons is similar to, but not identical to, traditional BI belief.
From time-to-time, information comes out on how some members of the British royal family have believed in their descent from David. Prince Charles for instance has stated such. And

many of the kings of England and Scotland have been anti-Catholic Masons. A minority belief amongst some of these key Masons has been the belief that they inherited the throne of David which was transferred to Britain.40

40 Of course, there are Masons and Masons - they are divided into various competing factions and groups. The US founding fathers were predominantly deists and Masons linked to anti-RCC protestants. Their power and influence has shrunk the last 30 years as agnostics, new agers and RCCers and other circles gain the ascendancy. Most US Presidents were Masons (apparently Ronald Reagan was an exception). Truly, our leaders have mixed paganism with truth and no Christian should dabble with Masonry. The US constitution was largely framed by these people - God certainly works in mysterious ways (Dan 2:21). Truly, the leaders of the House of Israel have been neo-pagan in the main. The old WCG booklet and books by others reveal the origin of some of the rituals of Masonry - but whether most Masons actually realise their origin or really care, is not known. It may be that they consider the rituals and symbols to be merely historical relics of earlier cross-religious contacts. Regardless, while most of them are Protestants and very anti-RCC, anti-Communist, anti-Fascist and such like, the origin of so much of their rituals and traditions are certainly not Christian. With this in mind, I recommend Adrian Gilbert’s book, The New Jerusalem. Gilbert demonstrates that some Masons have had an interest in this great British-Israel truth over the centuries.

NATIONAL AND TRIBAL EMBLEMS
Symbols and heraldry are not taken lightly by specialists:
“Heraldry has been termed the Shorthand of History ... [in Evans’ Grammar in Heraldry] “The antiquity of ensigns and symbols may be proved by reference to Holy Writ – ‘and they assembled all the congregation (of Israel) together on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers’ (Num. c. 1, v. 18) – ‘Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their fathers house’ (Num. c. 2, v. 2).” ... By the use of a certain coat of arms you assert your descent from the person to whom those arms were granted, confirmed or allowed. That is the beginning and end of armoury.”41
In other words a coat of arms must prove its historical validity to one of the Kings of Arms: Garter King at Arms (England); Lyon King at Arms (Scotland); Ulster King at Arms (northern Ireland). It is not some little thing, but an important aspect of national ethnic memory and roots.
The formidable lion – symbol of Judah
1. Lion
The book of Genesis states the following about the future of Judah at that time:
“Judah, may your brothers praise you. May your hand be in the neck of your enemies. May your father's sons bow before you [the royal line]. Judah is a lion's whelp. My son, you have gone up from the prey. He stooped, he crouched like a lion; and like a lioness, who shall rouse him? [a warrior people] The scepter [the royal line] shall not depart from Judah, nor a Lawgiver [excellent administrators and developers of policy] from between his feet, until Shiloh come. And the obedience of the peoples to him.” (Gen 49:8-10)
Various lion symbols are rampant in Scotland and found in royal and family coats of arms, banners, flags and various emblems.
2. Raised Red Right Hand
A tradition amongst the Ulster Scots is that their Right Hand symbol may find its genesis in the Bible:
41 Scott-Davies 1972: 24, 6, 24



Some Notes on the True Roots and Origin of the Scots
39
"And it came to pass, when she travailed that the one put out his hand, and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying "This came out first" And it came to pass, as he draw back his hand, that behold, his brother came out, and she said, "How hast thou broken forth? This breach be upon thee". Therefore his name was called Pharez. And afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon ftis hand, and his name was called Zarah." (Gen 38:28-30)
The Royal line was to continue through Judah, the fourth son of Jacob (Israel) (Gen 49:10). Christ Himself is a descendant of Pharez.
But Zarah left Egypt and founded colonies in Troy, Iberia next to the Colchis and in Iberia (Spain). Further information is contained in W. H. Bennett’s book Symbols of our CeltoSaxon Heritage pages 110-114.
Due the descendants of Zarah being deprived of their prime status, they decided to migrate to out of the Near East to Europe, settling in Spain.
Later, the descendants of Zarah established the a kingdom on Ulster in the 17-15th century BC (the dates depend on which history one decides to accept).42 Other members of the line of Pharez brought the other symbols with them including the harp, crown and six-pointed star.
The mythology of the Red Hand is a bit different, however. In this myth two giants were involved in a race from Scotland across the Irish Sea in a contest to possess Ulster. The winner, O’Neill, claimed victory by cutting off his hand and cast it onto the shore at Ulster. However, apparently this was a left hand and demonstrates how mythology can mix truth up.
But could the account in Genesis 38 be the true origin of the Red Hand of Ulster symbol?
What of the Scarlet Thread which runs through the British Naval Rope – is there a connection clear back to the Scarlet Thread of Zarah? Of further interest is that British official documents are tied with red ribbon (hence the term ‘red tape). In addition, the maps of the world showed the British Empire in red or pink and the British troops were known as red coats.
Further, the Coat of Arms of Northern Ireland contained a scarlet thread surrounding the Red Hand. But, in 1920 when the Home Rule Act incorporated the northeast in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, this thread no longer appeared around the hand. Possibly, this symbolises the union of Zarah and Pharez.
Red Hand of Ulster
42 One theory suggests that the descendants of Zarah migrated out of the Near East under Calcol himself in the 17th century BC.

The famous uplifted red right hand is a clear symbol of Judah. A depiction of it may still be seen on one of the oldest Irish harps which have been preserved in Trinity College, Dublin.
What could be the derivation of this symbol? Clearly it is Biblical: it is a means to assert “I swear” as if in a covenant relationship. This symbol therefore is very good reminder of that Covenant with God through their ancestors.
“I will remember the years of the Right Hand of the Most High” (Ps 77:10)
“Thy Right Hand, O God, has become glorious in power” (Ex 15:6)
One of the best books on the subject of Biblical symbolism and typology is Dictionary of Biblical Imagery which explains that
“In social concourse, oaths and agreements were affirmed with the right hand (Gen 14:22; Ezek 17:18; Dan 12:7), expressions of fellowship were sealed with a right-handed handshake (Ezra 10:19), and giving and receiving were done with the right hand (Ps 26:10; Gal 2:9) ...
“The right hand is the preferred one in patriarchal blessings (Gen 48:17-20); solemn oaths are made via the uplifted right hand (Is 62:8; Rev 10:5-7) ... God’s right hand is said to be “filled with righteousness” (Ps 48:10) and effective might (Ps 80:15-16; 89:13). With his right hand he delivered Israel out of Egypt ...”43
Christ is Himself at God’s right hand (Acts 2:33-34; Heb 1:3). No wonder, then, that the Ulster Scots use this symbol so powerfully, not willing to bow to the globalists or their rivals, the Church of Rome, or certain American millionaires.
In a sense Judah is also at God’s right hand because of their character and nature:
“Ephraim circles around Me with lying, and the house of Israel with deceit. But Judah still rules with God, and is faithful with the saints.” (Hos 11:12)
In other words they still remember the covenant, at least to some degree. The Jews today still observe the Sabbath and the Scottish Presbyterians are also known as ‘covenanters’ who are social conservatives, Biblical literalists and lean strongly toward the Old Testament. From them, in the main, have sprung the school of theonomy and move toward Hebraic Biblical roots among many Protestants today.
In fact, the seventh-day Sabbath observance continued in Scotland for at least 1,000 years after it died out in other parts of Europe.
After the invention of the printing press, many common folk were able to have access to the Bible. In turn, religions thinkers such as Martin Luther arose who started the famous Protestant Reformation in 1517AD.
About 20 years later, John Calvin, a French Swiss, refined the philosophy of the Reformation and was joined by John Knox. Knox, a Scotsman. Knox took Calvin’s teachings back to Scotland from Geneva, Switzerland and before long Reformed communities arose in Scotland, England, Holland and France. After some circuitous adventures fleeing persecution, Knox organized the Presbyterian Church of Scotland These are the roots of the Presbyterian Church.

Their view is similar to that of the Puritans when we come to the issue of their Sabbath: they observe their day strictly and attempt to utilise Old Testament scriptures to back up their claim that the Sabbath is still relevant and must be kept. In many ways, their exposition of the Sabbath is like Church of God material. But how unfortunate that they accept that the Sabbath is the seventh day, but transfer it to the first!
The Presbyterians have also figured prominently in American history. For example, Rev William Tennent founded a ministerial college that later evolved into Princeton University. Another was Rev John Witherspoon, one of the signaturees to the Declaration of Independence. Others were major influences in the Great Awakening of the 18th century.
To this day, the right hand is raised in when taking an oath in courts around the world.
3. Coat of Arms and Banners
Scottish Coat of Arms
The Queen’s Royal Banner in Scotland
Another emblem is the Scottish banner which must be one of the prettiest one can observe.
The banner is a golden flag with two unicorns. On the left of the flag is the banner of Scotland with a rampant lion with the flag staff supported by a unicorn. On the right you can find another unicorn supporting a flag staff with the flag of Saint Andrew (blue with a white

cross). Each unicorn wears a crown on their heads and a golden cornet around their necks and golden chains attached, hanging down to the ground.
Between the two unicorns is a shield with a large red rampant lion. On top of the shield is a crowned knight’s helmet. Atop the helmet in turn is yet another lion – but instead of being in the rampant pose – is found holding the sceptre and sword. Next to this lion is the motto “In Defence”. It has been suggested that this lion represents Christ.
At the very bottom of the scroll a motto reads “No one attacks me with impunity”. You cannot get more Judaic than that!
Of further interest is how supportive of the Empire the Jews were. The Rothschilds Coat of Arms, for instance, includes the unicorn and lion prominently.
The Coat of Arms of Great Britain
Note: the above British Coat of Arms is dominated by Judaic symbolisms. The lion of the tribe of Judah; young lions, harp of David; Zarah’s red thread; and the motto ‘God and my Right’, sometimes interpreted as meaning ‘God and my Birthright [of Ephraim]’ and/or ‘God and my right [to rule].”
Finally, we should not forget the famous Scottish Kilt. Prof Isserlin is a retired head of Semitic studies at Leeds University. Isserlin synthesis of ancient Israelitish religion, culture, chronology and literature. In an amazing statement on page 98 he says:
“they wear their hair long, or a wig, and may be clean-shaven or bearded. Their dress may be long or short tunics or kilts, sometimes perhaps a short upper tunic above a long one.”44
An ancient inscription of Israelites wearing plaid kilts also appears on that page.
There are other national symbols that could be drawn upon, but the above should suffice for this purpose.
See also Appendices 6 and 7 for further information.

SCOTTISH CHARACTER AND ATTRIBUTES
“If the Irish possess charm, the Welsh the gift of poetic utterance; and the English be noted for their composure and calmness of manner; the Scots, whether dour Lowlanders or lively Highlanders, are the most loved characters in the British Isles. Their influence has gone far beyond the border; far, far beyond these shores”.45
One major attribute are their deep religious convictions and in particular the concept of “covenanting” with God. So fiercely independent are these people that for centuries after the English church surrendered to Rome, the Scottish churches maintained their independence.
Presbyterian Church is a strange one, mixing more truth with error than most if not all other Protestant churches. Refer to the website The Covenanters for further information on the background to this denomination.46
Many do not realise that the term ‘Red Neck’ is of Scottish origin, referring to the supporters of the ‘National Covenant’ and ‘The Solemn League and Covenant’ (ie the “Covenanters”) which were Lowlanders, in the main, of Presbyterian heritage. Many fled Scotland to Ulster to escape persecution. But by 1638 and again in 1641, they declared that they preferred the Presbyterian form of church governance to that of the Church of England. They simply refused to accept the Anglican Church as their state religion.
Because many of them signed in their own blood and around their neck wore red cloth, the term ‘Red neck’ arose which was a slang word for dissenter. Because so many Ulster Scots were Presbyterian, this term was placed on their descendants in the southern states of the USA.
Indeed, it is these that have led the charge for centuries on behalf of the anti-Papists, screaming against the Roman Catholic Church and at one stage even planning to invade Europe to wipe out the Catholic Church.
These people have gone to the Old Testament and realised that it was not ‘done away’. But rather utilised it to the extent that they understood it, identifying themselves with Israel and banning Christmas, Halloween, pilgrimages to holy wells and such like. The Catholic Church was regarded as Babylon and Anti-Christ. Oppressors were likened to the Pharaoh, some leaders to Moses.
With the defeat of the Catholics was born the Orange Order which yielded immense political power. The Freemasons were also mainly Protestants and anti-Catholic, a boys club with strange, ancient traditions which they either didn’t understand or attempted to provide ‘Christian’ interpretations to it. However, the differences between the Orange Order and Freemasons led to their occasional clashings.47
“Orangeism never reached the position in Australia which it held in certain Canadian provinces. There were lodges and Twelfth of July processions but little of the political influence which the Order wielded in Ireland and in Canada.”48
According to Fry
45 Court 1987: iii 46 The Covenanters website http://www.tartans.com/articles/covmain.html. 47 Fitzpatrick 1989: 183 48 Fitzpatrick 1989: 239

“a reading of scripture (Romans xi, 25-6) that the Second Coming would not occur till God’s chosen people were converted to Christianity, turned into a minor obsession of Scots”.49
“Some citadels of global capitalism – Montreal, Hong Kong, Calcutta, Singapore – owe their existence largely to Scots, who have seldom been absent from any of the others either ... Some diaspora belongs to the history of a people who have always been inventive, energetic, adaptable and mobile”.50
“in 1899 one French monk, Father Louis Navarre, reported in apparent panic that by now all the island’s officials and traders were Scots, Presbyterians and freemasons of the Scottish rite, the most frenzied enemies of Rome”.51 [emphasis mine]
Other characteristics include52:
 Strength  Acuteness and inquisitiveness  Inventive turn of mind  Quick to find expedients  Restless and nervous energy  Dominant individualism/rugged individuals  Highly developed sense of personal honour53  “...comparatively well-schooled and skilled, with a tendency to practical and commercial ability, with a liking for reading about foreign parts.”54  Better educated than the English which was “based on a philosophy of common sense and was traditionally broad in scope ... shaping the Scots as adaptable and practical, especially in handling money, and as articulate speakers”55  “Scots are good with finance”56  “stubbornness in pursuit of a principle57  “rugged, dogged ... determination ... but could be generous”58
A highly recommended reading is God’s Frontiersmen. The Scots-Irish Epic by Rory Fitzpatrick. According to the research of Fitzpatrick, during the American Old West,
“the Scots-Irish people provided most of is pioneers ... the American War of Independence ... One contemporary summed up the whole revolution as ‘an Irish-Scotch Presbyterian Rebellion’ ”59
49 Fry 2001: 390 50 Fry 2001: 489 51 Fry 2001: 237 52 Fitzpatrick 1989: 123 53 In Beddoes’s Races of Britain we find the following attributes listed: Quick in temper; Clear thinking; Fertile imaginations; “love the absolute in thought”; “dislike expediency and doubt”; “Sympathetic with the weak, patriotic, chivalrous”; “hopeful and sanguine”; “Often witty and eloquent”; “lovers of the animal kingdom”. 54 Prentis 1983: 22 55 ibid: 157 56 ibid: 157 57 ibid: 158 58 ibid: 159. For instance: “... the Scot has possibly a more marked character than many other peoples and may have retained more of the old than some other peoples. That he has kept so much of the old in spite of absorption in Britain is testimony to the strength of his type.” (Notestein 1946: 319) 59 Fitzpatrick 1989: 2. ‘Call it not an American Rebellion, it is nothing more nor less than an Irish-Scots Presbyterian Rebellion’ – Captain Johann Heinricks, German mercenary serving with the British c.1780

“On each succeeding frontier to the Rocky Mountains, the Scots-Irish were prominent either as groups or as individuals. They spearheaded the thrusts through the Appalachians into Western Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Tennessee ... In both Australia and New Zealand educated Ulster Scots were providing a remarkable proportion of the professional people – doctors, lawyers, engineers – on which the new colonial societies were built ... [they were] a distinct racial group ... A people who in many ways were the epitome of mobility and change”.60 [emphasis mine]
He goes on to describe the Scots as restless.61 See Appendix 4 for more information on the Scots.
Even during the highland clearance campaign, the Highlanders survived and those that moved to North America were rather successful.62
A further characteristic of these people was their strong language (written and verbal), yet they were generally tolerant of other views which they engaged admirably with talented responses and insights.63 Fitzpatrick continues:
“In the last quarter of the sixteenth century the corrupt and disorganized Roman Catholic Church in Scotland had been overturned by the fanatical zeal of Calvinist reformers like Andrew Melville and John Knox ... a return to the primitive purity of Christ’s Apostolic Church ... seventeenth-century Scots saw close comparisons with ancient Israel ...
“The idea of a people sworn or covenanted to God and living according to his rules has been brilliantly expounded down the years by charismatic preachers, first to the Scots and then to the Scots-Irish peoples ... It was this vision which engrained in the future Scots-Irish people their hunger for a Promised Land. This land has always remained beyond the next horizon but the words ‘Zion’, ‘the land of Canaan’ and ‘Eden’ have appeared again and again in text and political speech throughout Scots-Irish history, whether in Ulster, on the Pennsylvanian frontier or in the early wilderness of Upper Canada.”64 [emphasis mine]
He continues to state that
“The certainty that God was watching over them was as strong with the new Scots settlers as with the Israelites of old”.65 [emphasis mine]
“.. they were the most successful settlers ... they could cope better ... with frontier conditions ... The English settlers who had come earlier had, after their initial thrust, been unenterprising, clinging for over a century to the Atlantic coastlines and river estuaries. The Ulster people, on the other hand, penetrated far and fast into the wilderness, having little fear of the unknown.”66 [emphasis mine]
Their style was fearless, quick and effective – more rapid than any other immigrant group.
Another characteristic was their “abiding hatred for totalitarian power”, as well as unfairness, inequity, bullying and abuse.

Michael Fry’s monumental work, The Scottish Empire, is one of several regaining the true attributes and contribution of the Scots to the world for the purpose of historical accuracy. As he noted, so much of Scottish history is inadequately presented and much of it not even published.67
His basic thesis is that the various experiences associated with the Reformation, union with England, the famous Scottish Enlightenment and their role in the Empire, were forces that contributed to forming the Scottish character and modern nation.
The 18th century Enlightenment which was led by universities at Glasgow and Edinburgh. The embodiment of the Enlightenment may be found in such names as thinkers as Adam Smith (modern capitalism), David Hume and Francis Hutcheson (rebellion against tyrants and political liberty).
The capacity, social forces and intellectual ability of the Scots developed independently of the English and pre-dated Union, as did, of course, the Scottish Enlightenment and industrialization. It was James Watt who perfected the steam engine which became necessary for the industrial revolution.
However, once Union with England occurred, they had an outlet for these immense pent-up energies. Now they had access to the Empire’s vast marketplace. Out of all proportion to their numbers, they supplied large numbers of sailors, soldiers, colonists, administrators and engineers for the Empire.
Yet, simultaneously, on American soil, they were most prominent in the rebellion against the Empire!
Another recommended work is David Hackett Fischer’s Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America.
His thesis is summarised by the following: the independence of the Scotch-Irish in the Appalachians may be traced to the centuries of warfare along the border of northern Ireland with the south and also the southern Scottish borderlands with England. It is from these areas that the settlers in the Appalachian chain settled in the mid-1600s.
The traditional suspicion of government and associated institutions as well as an intense loyalty to clan and tribe, led to a sense of social and cultural conservatism, clinging to folkways and traditions with very deep roots.
In addition, claims Fischer, this produced a passion for religion that was so zealous and evangelistic. However, the Scots were always like this – their American experience merely provided a further step in their religious zeal. (Appendix 16 contains further details)
This work is a highly recommended reading, putting for rest the notion that the Empire was English, for indeed it was British as its name suggests, including the Scots to a large degree and also the Welsh. As Fry points out, the Scottish basically ran the Empire.
Yair Davidy writing in The Tribes notes:
“The Scots are considered amongst the most intelligent people on earth and many scientific breakthroughs may be attributed to Scotsmen – the Jews are in a similar position. Scottish individuals are amongst the
67 Fry 2001: vii. Note also “Though always a richer, more advanced and more powerful country, England has somewhat paradoxically always had something to gain from Scotland” (Prentis 1983: 12)

wealthiest and most influential people in Britain – the Jews in many continental European countries once held a parallel status. Some modern Jews may descend from the Khazars whose national core derived from the Agathyrsi, a colony of whom had settled in Scotland.”68 [emphasis mine]
The inventiveness of the Scots is becoming more and more known around the globe.
A recent book on the subject of Scottish genius and creativity, is Stewart Lamont’s When Scotland Ruled the World – a celebration of Scotland’s overwhelmingly dominant capacity for inventiveness and administration. Lamont argues that while the Scots are few in number, their influence has been absolutely massive on the world stage.
The book is arranged into chapters on men of science, their influence in North America, writers, pioneers, medicine, prime ministers and such like. Within each chapter he presents a biography of the major Scottish contributors to world civilization. In the final chapter The Scots Psyche, he makes some very interesting observations and I list some below:
 “Scots are fighters. Their belligerence may of may not take a violent or military form. It might simply be the wish to fight for rights or a principle”69  “Scots are proud of being fighters, but they are also sentimental”70  Scots have “a reputation for being quarrelsome over religion”71  Their motto ‘Who dares meddle with me?’ “is more than an echo ... in the motto ‘Who Dares, Wins’ adopted by the crack troops of the Special Air Service (SAS), founded by a Scot, David Stirling”72  Their “fighting instincts are defensive rather than provocative, and he is at his best when fighting to defend a principle than to enlarge his power or dominion”73  “We do not like money to be wasted, nor do we admire those who have it in abundance”74
Writing in The Celts, Jean Markale remarks that the Celts possessed:
“no fear of death [and consequently] they could envisage the future with serenity and devote their thoughts to imagining the world beyond ... With their well-developed sense of imagination the Celts had an extraordinary ability to fly above the real and even to despise it. No other race has ever refused so determinedly to confront the material realities besetting it.”75
In a landmark work How the Scots invented the Modern World. The True Story of how Western Europe’s Poorest Nation Created our Modern World and Everything in it, Arthur Herman became famous because he “created the biggest stir on both sides of the Atlantic” according to The Scotsman newspaper.
Among his credentials, Herman is Coordinator of the Western Heritage Program at the world renowned Smithsonian Institution and a consulting historical editor for Time-Life Books. He was also associate professor of history at George Mason University and received his doctorate in history from John Hopkins University.

Herman, who says that he has no Scottish blood, points out that it was the Scots who invented the idea of ‘modernity’ in the late 1700s. The following century, due to their characteristic ‘traveling itch’, they took these concepts abroad. This was the basis for capitalism, fascination with technology, democracy, individualism – the Scots transformed the world into elections and free markets that we know today. America and the West still uphold these basic values to this day.
Famous Scottish Americans such as Andrew Carnegie, Francis Scott Key, John Paul Jones changed their nationality but obviously maintained their ethnic character. What of Alexander Graham Bell, Simon MacTavish, Charles James Napier and so on? Inventors, warriors, diplomats, bureaucrats, engineers – you name it, the Scots either succeeded very well at these tasks or invented systems and technology which the world later enjoyed.
The book celebrates Scottish creative imagination and capacity to inventiveness and administrative leadership. It simply elucidates basic historical data, setting them out in a simple format that is easy to understand.
They prized the ideal of progress by utilizing the measure of “by how far we have come from where we once were”.
There are many also some similarities between the Scots and Jews which include being very good with money, occupy chief banking circles, tremendous military capacity.
Herman states that
“... This is the story of how the Scots created the basic idea of modernity. It will show how that idea transformed their own culture and society in the eighteenth century, and how they carried it with them wherever they went. Obviously, the Scots did not do everything by themselves: other nationsGermans, French, English, Italians, Russians, and many others—have their place in the making of the modern world. But it is the Scots more than anyone else who have created the lens through which we see the final product. When we gaze out on a contemporary world shaped by technology, capitalism, and modern democracy, and struggle to find our place as individuals in it, we are in effect viewing the world as the Scots did ... The story of Scotland in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is one of hard-earned triumph and heart-rending tragedy, spilled blood and ruined lives, as well as of great achievement.” [emphasis mine]
The Scots are also known as great travelers – always on the go and moving a lot.
Even the American Founding Fathers have a lot to be grateful to the Scots. In America's Founding Secret. What the Scottish Enlightenment Taught Our Founding Fathers, Robert W. Galvin argues that the contributions of Scottish migrants to America have been neglected. Their influence on America’s political culture is now, at last, being acknowledged.
He tracks their influence back to the Scottish Enlightenment which was based around the Glasgow and Edinburgh Universities. Galvin shows that both the people and works that came out of that Enlightenment found their way into American colonies which influenced greatly those that founded the new Republic. Indeed, many of their actual philosophies and words may be found in the constitutions of the United States and many of the State governments as well as in the Declaration of Independence.

Much more information is available from the The Ulster-Scots Agency76 which has the following information:
 Voyage to the New World - How the Ulster-Scots or Scots-Irish came to America  Ulster-Scots and Washington's Generals - How men with Ulster connections helped shape America through battle  Ulster-Scots and United States Presidents - Presidents with Ulster connections who helped shape America  Ulster-Scots and the Presbyterian Church - How Ulster-Scots defined church life in America  From Folk to Country - How the Ulster-Scots influenced music in America  The Ulster-Scots Legacy - Famous Americans with Ulster-Scots backgrounds  The Ulster-Scots in the USA Today - How the bond remains....  The Declaration of Independence - The Ulster-Scots and America's proudest moment - the signing of the Declaration of Independence...
They were famous for many pioneering attributes. Here are some examples according to the BBC’s survey of Scottish achievements:
 David Livingstone, explorer in Africa  Alexander MacKenzie – discovered Canada  McDowall Stuart – first man to cross Australia  John Paul Jones - Founder of the US Navy  Nathahael Gordon – founder of the Russian Navy  William Paterson – founder of Bank of England  John Law – founder of the Bank of Scotland  Scots also provided the bodyguard for the King of France for centuries  Thousands of others rose to high service to the kings of Prussia, Sweden and the Netherlands  They have risen to be US Presidents and Prime Ministers of Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand77
We can thank the Scots for the world’s first modern nation which has become a model for the rest of the world; it is also they that created the world’s first literate society; and it is they that invented both modern capitalism and democracy.
The Scottish Enlightenment inspired the American Revolution and Constitution; hundreds of thousand went forth to the colonies to become administrators in Hong Kong, populate and farm the Australian outback, created the American frontier, and also settled in Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.
All those years ago back in 1989 I read a remarkable article in the South African Panorama magazine, “Our Scottish Heritage”, which reinforced my belief in the Judaic heritage of the Scots. I quote from it below:
“It was the English writer Sir Walter Besant who wrote of the Scots in an English journal: ‘Wherever the pilgrim turns his feet, he finds Scotsmen in the forefront of civilization and letters. They are the premiers in every colony, professors in

every university, teachers, editors, lawyers, engineers and merchants everything, and always at the front.’ ”78
In Africa, the article explains, the Scots were great explorers, missionaries and merchants. Over the next several pages the author cites among these major achievers as James Bruce (explorer), Robert Hart (missionary), ministers with the Dutch Reform Church such as George Thom (due to the close affinity between the Dutch Reform Church and the Presbyterians). In fact, the Dutch Reform Church was founded by a Scot!
The first steam locomotive in South Africa was built and designed by a Scottish company (Hawthorn & Co). The very advanced South African railways, harbours, airports and road transport systems are all attributable to just six Scottish entrepreneurs.
Scottish academics left their mark upon South Africa including worl authorities on tropical and infectious diseases, anthropology etc.The famous Stellenbosch University was founded by a Scot!
Others that made their mark on the country include the famous David Livingstone and Robert Moffat. Governors include Sir George Grey and Lord Gladstone of Lanark. There are too many examples of Scottish achievement to quote from the article.
“Scottish immigrants and their descendants have had a widespread and profound influence on every sector of South African society, and out educational and legal systems as well as the church have acquired a decidedly Scottish flavour.”79
Here in Australia, an entire book has been devoted to the Scots titled The Scots in Australia which covers the period 1788-1900. The author, Malcolm Prentis, refers to various other works on the Scottish influence in early America, Canada and New Zealand which may be useful to follow up for further research.
In any event, meticulously examines the immigration officials, convicts and other immigrants. He analyses their contributions to commerce, industry, politics, the press, law, education, culture, the church and so on. Up to 1900, the Scots occupied a disproportionate number of seats in the Parliaments of the States of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. Similarly, a disproportionate number of Premiers in these States were Scottish.
... amazing achievements for a country of only 5 millions! Yet, if we were to recognise their Judaic roots, perhaps we would not be so surprised after all.80
The Scots are famous for dozens of achievements to the modern world whether they be in America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France, India, Poland, Russia, Scandinavia. Their contributions include arts and architecture, banking and finance, inventions, electronics, publishing and literature, medicine, politics and military.
Among the Scottish accomplishments and inventions include:
 Raincoat
78 McDonald 1989: 20 79 ibid: 30 80 Well might those without knowledge of the Judaic origin of the Scots attempt to demonstrate environmental forces that drove the Scots on to these accomplishments. However, we must not forget a Divine force working through Judaic blood. This reminds me of Paul Johnson’s Offshore Islanders which I read back in 1979 or thereabouts, in which he also argues similarly for the development of the English character. He is a tremendous historian, but when he makes statements in the epilogue such as "it is the function of [political] liberalism to redress the weakness of nature by reason. This is what civilisation is about”, demonstrates that even fine historians like him do not understand God’s Word. Yet such historians make a fine contribution to furthering our knowledge and understanding of the British peoples.

Another landmark work is Kevin Phillips’ The Cousins’ Wars: Religion, Politics and the
Triumph of Anglo-America. His primary thesis is that Anglo-American history occurred in three overlapping explosions of energy:
 English Civil War  American Revolution  American Civil War
He states that in each of the above wars, the Calvinistic/egalitarian/entrepreneurial spirit clashed with the older forces of politics (eg hierarchy, high church etc). His argument is that these forces created the means to British world power which was inherited by America. It was mainly the religion of Calvinism, Puritanism and the Yankees which provided the fortitude behind the victorious armies.
It is interesting that he notes:
"Compared with the weak or lackadaisical approach of the British Crown in putting down rebellion in 1642 and 1775, the Republican government of the United States was fast off the mark in 1861 -- and just as fast to suspend democratic procedures ... In Maryland, which had to choose a governor and a legislature in November, 1861, federal troops were used to prohibit voting by anyone who sympathized with the South."81 [emphasis mine]
There are so many myths about the British in North America, that a good book should be written on the subject, which the above only touches upon.
Over 250,000 Scotch-Irish migrated to America extending from the Pilgrim era through to about 1800. These Judaic Celts settled in large number in the American south, producing a different mentality to the north and a new Celtic civilisation. Others did settle in the north, becoming great entrepreneurs, businessmen and financiers, using Masonic connections as a boys network to fight the faintest whif of Popery or later, Communism. They possessed very strong moral and Protestant values.

“The South was not only defeated, it was destroyed and plundered. During the reconstruction, the best of the South [according to the author] left for the western territories. It is there that we find the vibrancy of the old South in Texas, California, the Northwest, and the Cowboy states ... Celtic blood is showing itself again in the American resistance to the Global elite.”82
George Washington himself said of those troops of his which were of Ulster origin:
“If defeated everywhere else, I will make my last stand amongst the ScotsIrish of the native Virginina.”
Many of his generals were of that stock including General Harry Know, General Dan Morgan and at least seven more.
The Judaic-Celtic mentality, when stirred, will take on anything, no matter how large, powerful or influential the opposition. Even when the odds are overwhelmingly against them, the Celtic peoples will have a go. Defeat is not a loss to them. It is a victory for them, for if you dare – you win. Just trying is a victory; while a victory in the traditional sense is a bonus.

FUTURE OF THE SCOTS JUDAH’S UNION WITH THE REST OF ISRAEL
In an interesting article “Empire Games. On imperial power and the vulnerabilities of American power”, Dominic Lieven notes:
“Today’s world order is the heir of European empire ... Europeans turned the Americas and Australasia into new Europes and, above all, new Englands. That is the geopolitical basis for the domination of the world by the English language and by political and economic ideologies which are mostly of British origin ... For reasons imbedded in Jewish and European history, many of the leading figures in this new elite [prior to 1914] were Jewish (although in Asia they were often Chinese or Indian) ... “After 1945 a second phase of globalization ensued, under the US leadership ... some nostalgia for empire is in evidence ... This nostalgia is now being expressed in Britain with a confidence unthinkable 30 years ago. A splendid museum of the British empire has opened in Bristol ... Media and academic fashion shadows a broader renewal of interest in empire. One inspiration for this is the belief that most ex-colonies have failed as independent states”.83 [emphasis mine]
A New Empire Nigh
According to Niall Ferguson in an article that appeared on the New York Times website:
“... Can the United States provide the necessary cash, even in the form of private-sector money? The answer is yes —— so long as foreign countries are willing to lend it to the United States. For the fact is that America is not only the world's biggest economy. It is also the world's biggest borrower. Its muscular military power is underwritten by foreign capital. This is an unusual circumstance. In the prime of the European empires, when the British ran much of the Middle East, the dominant power was supposed to be a creditor, not a debtor, investing large chunks of its own savings in the economic development of its colonies. Hegemony also meant hegemoney. Britain, the world's banker before 1914, never had to worry about a run on the pound during its imperial heyday. “...This might lead to the conclusion that Mr. Rogoff of the I.M.F. has little to worry about. But while being a hyperdebtor may not matter in economics, it can matter in the realm of strategy.
When the last great English-speaking empire bestrode the globe a hundred years ago, capital export was a foundation of its power. From 1870 to 1914, net capital flows out of London averaged from 4 to 5 percent of gross domestic product. On the eve of World War I, the capital flows reached an astonishing 9 percent. This was not only an extraordinary diversion of British savings overseas. It was also a remarkable attempt to transform the global economy by investing in commercial infrastructure —— docks, railways and telegraph lines —in what we now call less developed countries. From 1865 to 1914, nearly as large a proportion of total British savings went to Africa, Asia and Latin America as remained in Britain. Critics of colonialism may carp about the wickedness of empire, but the one undeniable benefit of British hegemony was that it encouraged investors to risk their money in poor countries.
“...Since the creation of the euro, investors have a whole new range of securities in which to invest. European bonds might look attractive if

foreigners, and not just Americanophobic French millionaires, start to think of the euro as safer than the dollar. Al Jazeera recently ran a cartoon of Uncle Sam weeping as the euro was run up a flagpole in place of the once-mighty dollar.” [emphasis mine]84
Famous author Paul Johnson summarises what the Empire was all about:
“However, the fact that England had declared itself an empire invalidated the papal award in official English eyes, a judgment made formal by Queen Elizabeth I’s chief minister, Sir William Cecil, who told the Spanish Ambassador that English settlers were free to claim for the Crown any territory in the Americas not yet settled. The term “the British Empire” came into use at about the same time. It was given a religious underpinning by the widespread belief in England, made explicit in Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, the most popular book in Elizabethan and Jacobean England after the Bible, that for historical reasons the English had succeeded the discredited Jews as the Elect Nation, had vindicated their claim by the Reformation, and had a global mission to carry thus-purified Christianity throughout the world.”85 [emphasis mine]
There are obviously different types of competing globalisms abounding and being pushed in the world today. It is a shame that the term globalism is being wrongly understood. There is no single globalism, but many competing varieties. Here are some:
 Old Marxism  American and British capitalism  United Nations and subsidiaries  New Age religions numbering in the hundreds, all squabbling amongst themselves  Radical Islam  Fabian socialist international  Catholicism  and who knows what else
... yet they compete and hate one another. But there are sometimes overlaps and cooperation when expedient.
The coming Exodus
The Bible clearly prophesies that both Israel and Judah will be reunited after a future exodus and return to the promised land:
Isa 11:16 And there shall be a highway for the remnant of His people, those left from Assyria; as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt. [the future Exodus will be primarily from Germany! This is just another proof that Assyria are the enemies of Israel in the latter days]
Isa 27:13 And it shall be, in that day the great ram's horn shall be blown [the 7th Trumpet – symbolised by the Feast of Trumpets], and those perishing in the land of Assyria shall come, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt shall come and shall worship Jehovah in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
Isa 43:1 But now so says Jehovah who created you, O Jacob, and He who formed you, O Israel; Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name; you are Mine.

Isa 43:2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you [ie disasters will not totally destroy them]. When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned; nor shall the flame kindle on you. Isa 43:3 For I am Jehovah your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I gave Egypt for your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for you [these peoples will be ruled by Israel]. Isa 43:4 Since you were precious in My sight, you have been honored, and I have loved you; therefore I will give men for you, and people for your life. Isa 43:5 Fear not; for I am with you. I will bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west. Isa 43:6 I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Do not keep back; bring My sons from far and My daughters from the ends of the earth;
Isa 43:7 everyone who is called by My name; for I have created him for My glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him. Isa 43:8 Bring out the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf who have ears. [physical and spiritual blind and deaf]
During this time, Israel and Judah will, at last, be united! The major scriptures on this subject are: Jer 31:1, 7-9; 50:4-5; Ezek 11:17; 34:12-13; 37:19-22. Other related scriptures include: Jer 12: 14-15; 16:15; 23:3-4, 7-8; 24:6-7; 30:3, 8-10; 33:6-9; 50:4-5, 19-20; Ps 14:7; 53:6; 68:6; 30:4; Lev 26: 42-46).
Other scriptures on the reunion of Israel and Judah include: Jer 3:17-19; Zech 12:10-14; Rom 11:26; Acts 15:16-17; Hos 1:11; 2:14; Mic 2:12; 5:4-7; Zech 8:7-8; 10:9-12.
Jer 31:6 For there shall be a day that the watchmen on Mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise and let us go up to Zion to Jehovah our God! Jer 31:7 For so says Jehovah, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations. Cry out, give praise and say, O Jehovah, save Your people, the remnant of Israel.
Jer 31:8 Behold, I will bring them from the north country and gather them from the corners of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and she who is in labor with child, together; a great company shall return there. Jer 31:9 They shall come with weeping, and with prayers I will lead them. I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way; they shall not stumble in it, for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is My firstborn. Jer 31:10 Hear the Word of Jehovah, O nations, and declare it in the coastlands afar off. And say, He who scattered Israel will gather him and keep him, as a shepherd keeps his flock.
In Dan 9:27 it indicates that Christ has 3 1⁄2 years of His ministry to complete. As He was sent to the lost sheep of the House of Israel, it figures that He will complete His ministry to them. Why? Because it is through Israel that Christ and the spirit-born children of God will rule and reign.
First, the rebels must be purged out (Ezek 20:35-38; Joel 3:20-21).
Eze 20:33 As I live, says the Lord Jehovah, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, I will reign over you. Eze 20:34 And I will bring you out from the people [second Exodus], and I will gather you out of the lands in which you are scattered among them [captivity in foreign lands], with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out.
Eze 20:35 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.

Eze 20:36 Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, says the Lord Jehovah. [this seems to be referring to a purging process during the Tribulation and/or afterward] Eze 20:37 And I will cause you to pass under the rod [Amos 5:3; Lev 27:32 this refers to the ‘Lord’s tithe’ of people set aside by Him], and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant. Eze 20:38 And I will purge out from among you the rebels and those who sin against Me. I will bring them out from the land where they reside, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel [rebels will be liberated, but will not enter the Holy Land – they will be purged – possibly with the aid of the Priests and Levites]. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.
In Jer 31:2 and Hos 2:14 we are told that God will work with Israel in the wilderness somewhere close to the Holy Land (see also Zech 13:9; Amos 5:3; Lev 27:32; Ezek 20:37). The prophecies show that only 1/3 of Israel will be left after the Tribulation, and only one 10th of that figure will be alive after the cleansing, to make it into the Holy Land.
In the Bible, when God set something back on track, He first cleansed the Priests followed by the Levites (see Malachi 3:2-6). Due to its senior position, Judah would have to be cleaned up at the outset as well:
“Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years” (Mal 3:4). See too Ezek 44:10-12; 48:11. Levi then, will be the tribe carrying out religious duties such as the religious teachers, ministers, executers of the Law as well as probably being the judges.
After her cleansing, Israel will be led into the Holy Land to complete her training to be led by the God and the saints via Judah, to colonise and rule the world (Hos 2:23; Zech 10:9). If the above analysis of scripture is correct, then we may find the following occurring at the outset of the Millennium, after the Day of the Lord:
1. Second Exodus from captivity in foreign lands after repentance 2. cleansing of the princes, Judah, Priests and Levites (in accordance with the principles of the Older Testament. See IIChron 29:1-5, 15-16, 34; 30:1) 3. cleansing then follows on to Ephraim and Manasseh (30:1-3) 4. the rest of Israel will then be cleansed 5. the New Covenant will be made after this cleansing (possibly including water baptism) 6. as we shall see, Israel will take certain gentile nations into servitude, at least for a while and colonise their former lands. Gradually, Christ will bring the rest of the world under Him through the children of God and Israel
Then God will restore His people to global leadership as the following scriptures demonstrate (see Appendix 8):
Isa 11:11 And it shall be in that day, the Lord shall again set His hand, the second time, to recover the remnant of His people that remains, from Assyria and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Ethiopia, and from Persia, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the coasts of the sea. Isa 11:12 And He shall lift up a banner for the nations, and shall gather the outcasts of Israel and gather together the scattered ones of Judah from the four corners of the earth. Isa 11:13 And the envy of Ephraim shall depart, and the foes of Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not trouble Ephraim. [English and Scots will stop their fighting]

Isa 11:14 But they shall fly on the shoulders of the Philistines to the west; they shall spoil the sons of the east together; they shall lay their hand on Edom and Moab; and the sons of Ammon shall obey them. [God will use them to conquer various nations] Isa 11:15 And Jehovah shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with His scorching wind He shall shake His hand over the River, and shall strike it into seven streams, and make one tread it with shoes.
Isa 19:17 And the land of Judah shall be a terror to Egypt [Mizraim];
everyone who mentions it shall be afraid toward it, because of the purpose of Jehovah of Hosts, which He has purposed against it.
Jer 33:14 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.
Jer 33:17 For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man [of Judah] to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;
Joe 3:18 And it shall be, in that day the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and shall water the valley of Shittim.
Joe 3:19 Egypt shall be a ruin, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, from violence done to the sons of Judah, whose innocent blood they poured out in their land. Joe 3:20 But Judah will dwell forever, and Jerusalem to generation and generation. [just as the Scots were the pioneers leading the way so often in the colonies, in bringing tribes and peoples to heel under Israel, so they shall fulfil this function again].
Zec 9:13 For I have bent Judah for me as a bow; I filled it with Ephraim, and I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and make you as the sword of a mighty man. [see 10:3-7] Zec 9:14 And Jehovah shall be seen over them, and His arrow shall go forth like the lightning [how? Via the Ephraimites, led by Judah]; and the Lord Jehovah shall blow the ram's horn [Day of Trumpets – symbolising war?], and shall go out with the windstorms of the south [Judah].
Zec 9:15 Jehovah of Hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour and trample the slingstones. And they shall drink and be boisterous, as through wine. And they shall be filled like a bowl, and like the corners of the altar. Zec 10:3 My anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for Jehovah of Hosts has visited His flock the house of Judah, and has made them as His beautiful horse in battle.
Zec 10:4 Out of Him came the cornerstone; out of Him the nail; out of Him the battle bow; out of Him every oppressor together.
Zec 10:5 And they shall be like mighty ones who trample the mud of the streets in the battle. And they shall fight because Jehovah is with them, and they shall make the riders on horses ashamed.
Zec 10:6 And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the
house of Joseph, and I will return to save them; for I have pity on them. And they shall be as though I had not cast them off; for I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them.
Zec 10:7 And Ephraim shall be like a mighty one, and their heart shall rejoice as by wine. And their sons shall see and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in Jehovah. Zec 10:8 I will hiss for them and gather them; for I have redeemed them. And they shall be many as they were many. Zec 10:9 And I will sow them among the peoples, and they shall remember Me in the distances; and they shall live with their sons and return. Zec 10:10 I will return them out of the land of Egypt, and I will gather them out of Assyria [second Exodus]; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and

Lebanon; for room shall not be found for them. [this population explosion will necessitate them to become colonisers again]
Zec 12:5 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The people of Jerusalem shall be my strength in Jehovah of Hosts their God.
Zec 12:6 In that day I will make the governors of Judah like a hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire among cut grain. And they shall devour all the peoples all around, on the right hand and on the left hand. And Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her place, in Jerusalem. Zec 12:7 Jehovah also shall save the tents of Judah first, so that the
glory of the house of David and the glory of the people of Jerusalem may not be magnified above Judah. Zec 12:8 In that day Jehovah shall defend around the people of Jerusalem. And it will be, he who is feeble among them at that day shall be like David; and the house of David shall be like God, like the Angel of Jehovah before them.
Zec 14:14 And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the nations all around shall be gathered, gold, and silver, and clothing in great abundance [those nations who stole Israel’s wealth in the Tribulation, will have that wealth confiscated]
Judah produced the royal line, a warrior class and lawmakers. In other words they were to be the political leaders as we have seen. It is interesting that the Scots have produced inventions, military leaders and political leaders well above their numbers in the USA, Australia and South Africa. In ancient Israel they led the other tribes in the camp. In the USA they were in the forefront of the colonising people, leading the way. They are a very brave people who are willing to take on anything:
“The wicked flee when no man pursues; but the righteous are bold as a lion.” (Prov 28:1)
Throughout Bible times they dwelt within and in proximity to Jerusalem, the capital city of Jerusalem as the leading tribe. And were fierce defenders of God’s way together with the Levites; and were associated with the Temple and all that goes with leadership.
Recently a book was published titled Covenant People by Clifford Longley. The author (who is not a BI believer) draws a lot on Biblical references to God's covenant people and especially the coronation ceremony and relates this to the British and Americans. The belief in their parallel to Israel by the English, Puritans, Americans, Afrikaners. The influence of the concept in the British Empire and important segments of the American people, continue on to this day.
"An even more celebrated use of typology by Ronald Reagan was his reference to America as a 'shining city on a hill', which is a typological use of Matthew 5:14. It was by no means unique to him ..."86 [see Appendix 13 for a modern interpretation of America’s role today]
He mentions that the English had a "soft and benign version of the Chosen People theory that England's destiny was to shine 'a light unto the gentiles.' "87

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Today the Empire is but a remnant of its former glory. The good it brought to the world is still there in some ways.
Little Britain is still the world’s 4th largest economy with the 4th most powerful military! It is still the centre of world finance and the source of many great inventions.
It’s helicopters are more advanced than those of the US military according to a Discovery Channel documentary (2003) and its almost impenetrable new tanks are not able to be duplicated by any other power!
When the British send in 10,000 troops to do a job, the others send in 100,000 to do the same job (this is true right back to World War One). Why is this so? Why?
The British exported thousands of executives and scientists to the United States over the past 40 years helping give America a huge advantage over its rivals.
During the internet/IT boom of the late 1990s, the 10,000s of British moved to Silicon Valley and elsewhere and assisted mightily with America’s world technology dominance. What is it about the ‘Brits’ that they are able to do this?
No military or political power brought down the Empire. Rather, it was the Leftist university professors, media, Socialists on the one hand within. I have coined the phrase ‘Left-wing Fascists’ and ‘Pink Fascists’ to aptly describe their minority role in society – yet immense influence and power. Truly, these new Fascists are the ruling class (sometimes called ‘the new class’), controlling the masses through the media, culture, churches etc. And of course, cloning themselves in their bastions of minority will and power: universities. These Fascists seek out their own ilk to promote to tutor or lecturer status or to manouvre into positions. And they put down or even harass those that do not fit their mould.
They then clone the next generation of leaders in the media, churches, culture, education, trade unions and politics who, in turn, change society and model it along the lines of the Fascistic clone creators.
This is how the contributed to the destruction of the Empire.
Yet they remain in their ivory towers, protected by their mates in the media, never venturing out to experience society and what the majority want. Instead, they know what is best of the rest of us.
They are unaccountable for their actions, teachings and undermining of society – they remain so until governments around the world establish independent inquiries into their evil doings and Education Commissions to monitor their behaviour, actions and educational courses.
On the other extreme, both the neo-Nazis and the libertarian Right proclaim the conspiracy theory that the British still secretly rule the world; that the Queen is part African; that she is on top of the drug-pushing empire; that the Royals are New World Order Satanists; and that the British seek to destroy or takeover America!
Such wickedness and evil lies!

But they are not alone in their blind hatred for Britain: there were also jealous and bitter men on the other side of the Atlantic, Franklin Roosevelt foremost among them. For instance:
“... Britain turned to the US for a loan when the war – and Lend Lease ended in 1945. But the conditions attached to the loan at once had the effect of undermining British overseas power. In return for $3.75 billion [with the last instalment due to be paid in 2006], the Americans insisted that the pound be made convertible into the dollar within twelve months. The run on the Bank of England’s reserves this caused was the first of the succession of sterling crises that were to puncture Britain’s retreat from empire ... the US [was born] in a war against the British Empire”.89
In 1950 Britain produced 25% of the world’s manufacturing exports; over 33% of world merchant shipping launchings; 15% of world steel exports. By 1973 this had slid to 9%, 4% and 5% respectively.
As Ferguson noted, “it was the political decision that caused the economic change, not the other way around”.90
Yet Britain took the loan, even though the war was being turned against Hitler before American involvement.
“The dissolution of the British Empire—one of the most beneficient and enlightened political forces in history—took place for many reasons, including, it pains me to say, pressure from the United States. But part of the reason for its dissolution was inner uncertainty, weariness, a failure of nerve. By the middle of the last century Britain no longer wished to rule: it wanted to be liked. The promiscuous desire to be liked, for states as much as for individuals, is a profound character flaw. It signals a faltering of courage, what Pericles castigated as malakia, “effeminacy,” and a dangerous loss of self-confidence. At the height of the Cold War, the political commentator James Burnham observed that “Americans have not yet learned the tragic lesson that the most powerful cannot be loved—hated, envied, feared, obeyed, respected, even honored perhaps, but not loved.” Have we now, some forty years on, finally learned that lesson?”91 [emphasis mine]
Clifford Longley writes:
“In Britain in 1956 colonialism was not a dirty word. But the American desertion of its closest ally (as it seemed in London) [by America forcing Britain out of the Suez] was a severe blow to national prestige. The truth appears to be that Eisenhower and the State Department in Washington had become increasingly irritated by pretensions to equality with America, which were simply getting in the way of America ...”92
It is now becoming more and more obvious to the declining Anglo-Keltic-philes amongst the ruling classes that the dismantling of the British Empire has led to a world that is becoming uglier and more unmanageable by the day.
Britain was forced to buy warships that were not efficient and many quickly broke down. After WW2, Britain was still on rations when the Germans were taken off rations because of the extent of aid given to them.

Some Notes on the True Roots and Origin of the Scots

Jealousy and divisiveness between the twin powers continues and today the Anglo-SaxonKeltic powers are structurally in decline, even though in appearance they are at the top of the world:
“The “Partnership of Nations,” as America and its allies were billed in Afghanistan, consisted on the ground of the United States plus the British, Australian, and New Zealand SAS (special forces commandos) and somewhere a little further back Canada’s JTF2 (being semi-French, Canada is a semi-detached member of the Anglosphere). All these states are Britishderived and, on the face of it, suggest a working version of Winston Churchill’s dream of a grand reconciliation between the United States and the British Empire in some new configuration. But these days what these countries share is a common culture that, officially, recoils from the idea that they have a common culture. We’re multiculturalists now, and the salient point about multiculturalism is that it’s a unicultural phenomenon, existing almost entirely in the Anglo-American world.
Young Britons, we’re told by Tony Blair and the other Europhiles, now think of themselves as European—they eat pasta, they drink Perrier, they like nothing better than to curl up with a good EU harmonization directive on the permitted curvature of bananas, they wear regulation Euro-condoms, etc.
Similarly, Australians, according to their new orthodoxy, think of themselves as Asians. This was the essence of the republican case in the 1999 referendum on the monarchy: it was inappropriate to have an English queen presiding over a country with so many Vietnamese restaurants. As it transpired, not all Australians were up to speed on the new orthodoxy and on referendum day Her Majesty won handily. Australians, the republicans assured us, wanted an elected head of state. Now they’ve got one. To paraphrase Tony Blair, she is the people’s queen now.
Canadians, meanwhile, think of themselves as ... well, they’ve yet to come up with a word for it, but it sure as hell isn’t “British” or “American.” In the last thirty years, no other country has worked so hard to upturn the realities of both history and geography.”93
COMING: a new global Commonwealth (typified by the British Empire) with Israel ruling the world under the Messiah and His saints for the service and benefit of all mankind!
