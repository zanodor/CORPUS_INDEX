CHAPTER I
THE POLITICAL AND DYNASTIC HISTORY OF THE IRANIAN WORLD (A.D. I 000-1217)
I. T H E E A S T E R N I R A N I A N W O R L D ON T H E EVE OF THE TURKISH INVASIONS
For nearly a thousand years—indeed, until our own century—Iran has generally been ruled by non-Persian dynasties, usually Turkish but sometimes Mongol or Kurdish. This domination at the highest level has had less effect on Iranian national psychology and literary con sciousness than might be expected, for all of the alien ruling dynasties have come from races of low cultural development, and thus they have lacked the administrative expertise necessary for ruling a land of ancient settlement and civilization. Whether consciously or unconsciously, they have adopted Iranian culture at their courts, and they have been compelled to employ Iranian officials to administer the country and collect the taxes. The first such alien rulers were the Saljuq Turks, who appeared in the Iranian world in the first half of the 5th/nth century. For them as well as for their successors, the process of assimilation to the indi genous culture and practices of Persia was not uncongenial, because they were able to draw on the country's ancient traditions of exalted monarchic power and submissiveness by the people. Moreover, in these traditions kingly authority was identified with divine authority, which helped the dynasties to rise above their tribal origins. The Saljuqs had originated as chieftains of nomadic bands in the Central Asian steppes. Their powers and ambitions often hedged about by a complex of traditional tribal rights and customs, the steppe leaders were little more than primi inter pares amongst the heads of all the prominent tribal families. With their entry into the Iranian world, the Saljuqs and their successors found the instruments at hand with which to make themselves, if they so desired, despots of the traditional Persian stamp: these instruments were a settled administration, a steady revenue from taxation, and usually a personal guard and standing army.

Yet the process of self-magnification had a reverse side. What was to be done with the ladder by which these leaders had risen? For their supporters had included fellow tribesmen, e.g. the Saljuqs' Turkmen; military retainers, such as the Turkish and Mongol soldiers of the Mongol Qa'ans, and fellow sectaries and religious devotees, such as the Safavids' Qïzïl-Bâsh. In the Saljuq period the Oghuz and other Turkmen were a pressing problem for the sultans. How could the Turkmen be reconciled to the new concept of royal power—especially when they saw the old tribal custom, which defined and guaranteed each man's personal position and duties, quietly set aside and replaced by the Islamic sharfa and by the Iranian governmental ethos, in both of which political quietism and virtually unconditional obedience to the monarch were enjoined? This question, in varying terms, runs through much of Iran's history in the last nine centuries, underlying

many of its revolutions and crises of power. It is particularly important in the age of the Saljuqs, when the sultans were never able satisfactorily to resolve this tension in their empire. Whilst it is true that the coming of the Saljuqs inaugurated the age of alien, especially Turkish, rule, the change was not absolutely abrupt. We shall first of all be concerned with the eastern Iranian world, com prising Khurasan, the adjoining regions of modern Afghanistan, and the lands of the Oxus and Syr Darya basins. A t the opening of the 5th/nth century, the Iranian world still extended far beyond the Oxus, embracing the regions of Khwarazm, Transoxiana (called by the Arabs Ma ward* al-nahr, "the lands beyond the river"), and Farghana. In pre-Christian and early Christian times the Massagetae, the Sakae, the Scyths, the Sarmatians, and the Alans—all Indo-European peopleshad roamed the Eurasian steppes from the Ukraine to the Altai. The pressure of Altaic and Ugrian peoples from the heartland of Central Asia and Siberia gradually pushed the limits of Indo-European occu pation southwards, but until the end of the 4th/ioth century the lands along the Oxus and south of the Aral Sea, together with the middle and upper reaches of the Syr Darya as far as its sources in the slopes of the T'ien Shan, were still generally ruled by royal dynasties or local princes who were apparently Iranian. The picture presented by the holders of power is thus relatively straightforward, except that the Iranian names and titles of petty rulers and local landowners (dihqdns) in such frontier regions as Isfijab, Ilaq, and Farghana do not make it absolutely certain that they were racially Iranians. However, a demographic analysis of the whole population in this Iranian-ruled area involves certain diffi culties. From the earliest times Transoxiana has been a corridor through which peoples from the steppes have passed into the settled lands to the south and west; thus history and geography have worked against an ethnic homogeneity for the region. Whether the invading waves have receded or been swallowed up in the existing population, a human debris has inevitably been left behind. This was undoubtedly the origin of the Turkish elements in eastern Afghanistan, for these Oghuz and Khalaj were nomads on the plateau between Kabul and Bust when Muslim arms first penetrated there in the early centuries of Islam, and they survived as an ethnic unity throughout the periods of the Ghaznavids, Ghurids, and Khwarazm-Shahs. It has been plausibly argued by J. Marquart that these Turks were remnants of peoples brought from north of the Oxus by the confederation of the Ephthalites

or White Huns, whose leaders seem to have been of the same race as the Iranians.1 In Transoxiana and Khwarazm, the infiltration of Turkish elements must also have begun early. Topography—i.e. the mountain chains running east and west, the land-locked river basins and oases—made Transoxiana and especially Soghdia (the basin of the Zarafshan river) a politically fragmented region. In the ist/yth and 2nd/8th centuries the region was a battleground where Iranian rulers fought the invading Arabs from the south as well as the Western Turk or T'u-chueh from the north, with the Chinese keeping an eye on what w^as nominally a distant province of their empire. Turkish warriors were frequently invited from outside by the local rulers in an effort to repel the Arabs, but it is also possible that some of these troops were recruited from the Turks already settled within the borders of Transoxiana.2 For not all Turks were pastoral nomads or forest hunters. In such comparatively favoured spots of Central Asia as the Orkhon and Selenga valleys in Mongolia, and the Chu valley and shores of the lsiq-K6l in Semirechye ("land of the seven rivers", or the northern part of the modern Soviet Kirghiz republic and the parts of the Kazakh republic adjoining its northern borders)—in all these areas Turkish agriculturalists had been able to make a living in peaceful periods.3 Similarly, the rural peasantry and even the town populations of Transoxiana and Khwarazm may well have contained Turkish elements from an early date. Firdausi's Shah-Nama speaks of Iran and Turan, i.e. the Iranians and the Turks, as two naturally antipathetic groups: " two elements, fire and water, which rage against each other in the depths of the heart",4 but the economic facts, well brought out by the Arabic geographers, belie this. They say that the economy of the pastoralist Turks from the steppe was com plementary to and interdependent with the economy of the agricultural

oases and towns of the Iranian Tajiks. The settled regions supplied the nomads with cereals, manufactured goods, and arms, and the nomads reared stock animals and brought dairy products, hides, and furs to the farmers. In Transoxiana and Khwarazm, wrote al-Istakhri (c. 340/951), the Oghuz and Qarluq from beyond the Syr Darya and from the Qara Qum steppes supplied horses, sheep, camels, mules, and asses.1 It is likely, too, that some of the pastoralists remained in the market centres of the settled region and gradually settled down within its borders. The rule of native Iranian dynasties in Khwarazm, Transoxiana, and Khurasan foundered by the opening decades of the 5th/nth century. The Samanids of Bukhara had ruled in the latter two provinces, first as local administrators for the 'Abbasid governors of Khurasan, and then as virtually independent sovereigns.2 In the last decade of the 10th century their rule sustained almost simultaneous attacks from two Turkish powers, the Qarakhanids and the Ghaznavids. The Qarakhanids originated from a confederation of Turkish tribes who had long occupied the steppes that stretched from the middle Syr Darya to the T
cien Shan. Their nucleus seems to have been the Qarluq tribe and its component peoples of the Yaghma, Tukhsi, and Chigil. The Qarluq were an old people in the steppes, known from the ist/yth century as a constituent group within the Turku empire. Already the characteristic title for their chiefs, Ilig, appears in the Turfan texts of that period; and in later times Muslim sources often refer to the Qarakhanid dynasty as that of the Ilig-Khans. Within the various confederations that took shape in the steppes after the collapse of the Turku empire in 125 /y41, the head of the Qarluq assumed the title first of Yabghu and then of Qaghan (Arabic form, Khdqari), or "supreme monarch". The adoption of this latter title was to become characteristic of the Qara khanids, whereas the Saljuqs never felt entitled to adopt it. In the course of the 4th/ioth century the Qarluq became Muslim; the first ruler to become converted is traditionally held to be Satuq Bughra Khan (d. ? 344/955), who assumed the Islamic name of cAbd al-Karim and reigned from Kashghar and Talas over the western wing of his people.

2 There exists no special monograph devoted to the Samanids; the best account of this very important but still obscure dynasty remains that by W. Barthold in his Turkestan down to the Mongol Invasion, G[ibb] M[emorial] S[eries], vol. v, pp. 209 ff. See also Frye's brief survey, "The Samanids: a Little-Known Dynasty", Muslim World, pp. 40-5; and idem, The History of Bukhara (a translation of Narshakhi's Ta'rlkh-i Bukhara), the notes to which contain much valuable information on the Samanids.

Those who worked in the pagan outer darkness of the steppes were mainly the dervishes or Sufis, i.e. religious enthusiasts whose orthodoxy was suspect, and who were often persona non grata to the orthodox Samanid government and religious institution. Nevertheless the Qarakhanids became firm Sunnis once they entered the Islamic world.1 The Qarakhanid Bughra Khan Harun or Hasan, a grandson of Satuq Bughra Khan, temporarily occupied the Samanid capital of Bukhara in 382/992. A s he passed through Transoxiana he met with little opposition: indeed, he was encouraged in his action by the rebellious Samanid general Abu 'All Simjuri and also by discontented dihqans. Faced with the Qarakhanid invasion from the north and the revolt of the generals Abu cAli Simjuri and Fa'iq Khassa in Khurasan, the Samanid amir Nuh b. Mansur (366-87/976-7 to 997) was compelled to call in from Ghazna another of his Turkish slave commanders, Sebiik-Tegin.2 Abu Mansur Sebuk-Tegin (d. 387/997) was the founder of the Ghaznavid dynasty and father of the famous Mahmud of Ghazna (388-421/998-1030).3 Sebuk-Tegin came originally from Barskhan, a settlement on the shores of the Isiq-Kol, whose ruler, according to the anonymous author of the Persian geographical treatise Hudud al-alam ("Limits of the World"), was one of the Qarluq. It seems therefore probable that the Ghaznavids were of Qarluq origin. In a tribal war Sebiik-Tegin was captured by the neighbouring Tukhsi and sold in a Samanid slave market at Chach. Because of his hardiness and his skill with weapons, he rose rapidly from the ranks of the Samanids' slave guards, coming under the patronage of Chief Hajib or Commander-inChief Alp-Tegin. In 351/962 he accompanied his master to Ghazna, where Alp-Tegin henceforth established himself as ruler, and in 366/977 Sebiik-Tegin succeeded to power there, continuing, like his predecessors, to regard himself as governor there on behalf of the Samanids.4 In 384/994 the amir Nuh b. Mansur summoned SebiikTegin to Khurasan to fight the rebellious generals but this led to the establishment of the Ghaznavids in Khurasan and all the Samanid
1 The Qarakhanids and the Qarluq, from whom the dynasty very probably sprang, have been studied by O. Pritsak. Amongst his many articles on them, see especially "Karahanlilar" in Islam Ansiklopedisi; and on the origins of the dynasty, "Von den Karluk zu den Karachaniden Zeitscbrift der Deutschen Morgenldndischen Gesellschaft, pp. 270-300. 2 Cf. Barthold, Turkestan, pp. 254-61. 3 On the Ghaznavid dynasty, see B. Spuler, " Ghaznavids", Encyc. of Islam (2nd ed.); M. Nazim, The Life and Times of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazna; and Bosworth, The Ghaznavids. 4 On Sebuk-Tegin's early life and his rule as governor in Ghazna, see Nazim, op. cit. pp. 28-33, and Bosworth, The Ghaznavids, pp. 35-44.

provinces south of the Oxus. These territories were definitely annexed in 388/998 by Abu'l-Qasim Mahmud b. Sebuk-Tegin. Meanwhile it had proved impossible to dislodge the Qarakhanids from the Syr Darya basin, and in 389/999 the Samanid dynasty was definitely over thrown in Transoxiana by the Ilig Nasr b. 'Ali (d. 403/1012-13), nephew of Bughra Khan Harun. The heroism of the last of the Samanids, Isma'il al-Muntasir, could achieve nothing in the face of the division of the Samanid empire between the Ilig and Mahmud. In 391/1001 these two came to a formal agreement whereby the Oxus was to be the boundary between the two kingdoms, and in 395/1005 Isma'il was killed through the treachery of an Arab nomad chief in the Qara Qum desert.1 In the adjacent province of Khwarazm, the classical Chorasmia, the days of rule by native Iranian monarchs were also numbered. For several thousand years the region of the lower Oxus had held a complex of rich agricultural oases linked by irrigation canals, the full extent of which has only recently come to light through the researches of Soviet archaeologists. (The Iranian scholar al-Biruni says that the Khwarazmian era began when the region was first settled and cultivated, this date being placed in the early 13th-century B . C . ) That the ancient dynasty of Afrighid Khwarazm-Shahs survived for nearly three cen turies after the coming of Islam to their land is unique in the Islamic world: al-Biruni lists twenty-two rulers of this line running from A . D . 305 to 385/995.2 However, the vandalism of Qutaibab. Muslim's invading Arabs in 93/712 had an enfeebling effect on the culture of ancient Khwarazm, and this seems to have been aggravated by economic decline, whose symptoms, according to S. P. Tolstov, in cluded the neglect of irrigation works and the decline of urban life. The system of large fortified estates, which is characteristic of Khwarazm ian agrarian society at this time, was a response to increasing external pressure from Turkish steppe peoples, who were attracted not only by prospects of plunder but also by the winter pasture available along the shores of the Oxus. The Turkicizing of the population of Khwarazm probably began during this period.3 In the 4th/ioth century there were

villages with Turkish names on the right bank of the Oxus. The Ghaznavid historian Abu'1-Fadl Baihaqi speaks of Qi'pchaq, Küjet, and Chaghraq Turks harrying the fringes of Khwárazm in 422/103o,1 and a few years after this the Saljuqs and their followers spent some time on Khwárazmian pastures before moving southwards into Khurasan. The higher culture of Iranian Khwárazm offered resistance to the process of Turkicization, but the trend nevertheless continued over the next centuries (see pp. 141-2 below). In spite of this, the downfall of the native Afrighid dynasty of Khwárazm-Sháhs in 385/995 came about through internal disturbances. Gurganj, a town on the left bank of the Oxus, had grown in importance as the terminus of caravan trade across the Oghuz steppes to the Volga and southern Russia, thereby eclipsing the ancient capital on the right bank of Káth. A local Gurganj family, the Ma'münids, succeeded in deposing the last Afrighid, Abü 'Abdallah Muhammad, and assumed the traditional title of Khwárazm-Sháh. But their tenure of power was brief. The Sámánids had been nominal suzerains of Khwárazm, though in practice they had rarely interfered there; now the shadow of their supplanter, Mahmüd of Ghazna, grew menacing for the Ma'münids. In 406/1015-16 Abu'l-'Abbás Ma'mün b. Ma'mün married one of the Ghaznavid sultan's sisters, Hurra-yi Kalji; nevertheless, Ghaznavid pressure was relentless. The 'Abbásid caliph in Baghdad sent directly to the Khwárazm-Sháh a patent of investiture for Khwárazm, a standard, and the honorific titles 'Ain al-Daula wa Zain al-Milla ("Eye of the State and Ornament of the Religious Community " ) ; but the shah did not dare to receive these publicly in his capital Gurganj for fear of provoking Mahmüd's wrath. In the sultan's imperial strategy, possession of Khwá razm was necessary to turn the flank of the Qarakhánids, amongst whom the ruler of Samarqand and Bukhara—'AH b. Hasan Bughra Khan, known as CAH-Tegin (d. 425/1034)—was showing himself an implacable enemy of the Ghaznavids. After an ultimatum to the Khwárazmians, which contained humiliating demands and required the renunciation of national sovereignty, Mahmüd's troops invaded and annexed Khwárazm in 408/1017. The sultan then installed as Khwárazm-Sháh Altun-Tash, one of his most trusted slave generals and a former ghuldm or military retainer of his father Sebük-Tegin; for the next seventeen years Khwá

razm remained a salient of Ghaznavid power that reached into the steppes.1 Some Western orientalists have viewed the downfall of these north eastern Iranian dynasties through a certain romantic haze. They have idealized the Samanids, at whose court the renaissance of New Persian culture and literature began—a court adorned by such figures as Bal'ami, Rudaki, and Daqiqi; or, mourning the passing of the Khwarazm-Shahs, whose kingdom nurtured the polymath al-Biruni, they have called it the end of an epoch, after whicli Iran lost political control of its destiny for many centuries.2 O n the other hand, as V . Minorsky has justly pointed out, there have been few laments for the passing of those Iranian dynasties farther west, that also went down in the course of the 5th/nth century under Turkish pressure; yet the Buyids' court at Ray and Shiraz, the Kakuyids' at Isfahan, and the Ziyarids' court at Gurgan and Tabaristan gave shelter to such diverse geniuses as al-Mutanabbi, Avicenna, and al-Biruni. T o some extent these Western attitudes reflect those of the contemporary Sunni Muslim sources which are distinctly favourable to dynasties like the Tahirids and Samanids, sprung from the landed classes, while they are hostile to those of plebeian origin, e.g. the Saffarids or to those tinged with Shfism or unorthodoxy, such as the Buyids and Kakuyids.3 The collapse of the native Iranian dynasties of the north-east was followed within a few decades by a major migration of Turkish peoples, the Oghuz, from the outer steppes. Similar population movements have been recurrent features of the history of this region from early times, for the Oxus and Syr Darya basins are a transitional zone between Central Asia and the lands of ancient civilization in the Near East. The mountain chains of the Alburz [Elburz], Pamirs, and Hindu Kush are high and, being geologically young, are sharp and jagged, yet they have never seriously hindered the passage of armies and other peoples; nor have invaders from the steppes ever found that the transition to the Iranian plateau necessitated much change in their way of life. In order for a pastoralist economy to survive, each summer the flocks and

herds should be driven out of their winter grounds to pastures, or jailaqs, in the hills. Thus the terrain of Iran was quite well suited to the traditional way of life of Central Asian invaders. For instance, the oases of Khurasan could provide rich pasture for herds, and certain chamans (pasture grounds), e.g. the Ulang-i Radkan between Mashhad [Meshed] and Khabushan, and the Marg-i Sa'igh near Nasa, have played significant parts in Iranian history as the camping and grazing grounds of armies. As the Turkmen moved westwards, they found the valleys of Azarbaijan and Armenia and the plains of Anatolia highly suitable for their flocks. In this way the Saljuq and Mongol invasions inevitably had an effect on landholding and land utilization in the Iranian world. Yet these considerations do not explain why the Turkmen succeeded in bringing about permanent changes in the ethnography and economy of the Iranian world, whereas most of the earlier invaders had eventually been absorbed into the existing way of life. It was certainly not through sheer weight of human numbers, for there were not many Turkmen bands in Khurasan during the reign of Mas'ud b. Mahmud of Ghazna (421-32/1030-41), although the damaging effects of their sheep and goats as they nibbled across the country's agricultural oases were indeed serious.1 It seems that in the first half of the 5 th/ n t h century, the Iranian bastion of the north-east, whose age-old function had been to hold closed this corridor for peoples, lost its resilience and no longer possessed the absorptive power it had once had. In the previous century the Afrighid Khwarazm-Shahs had every autumn led an ex pedition into the steppes against the Turkmen; and the Samanid amirs launched punitive expeditions and slave raids across the Syr Darya, such as the famous campaign of Isma'Il b. Ahmad (279-95/892-907) against the Qarluq at Talas in 280/893.2 It is true that the groundwork for this collapse had been in some measure prepared, with Turks taking part in the internal wars of Transoxiana and also settling peacefully within its borders. Furthermore, from the early 3rd/9th century onwards Muslim rulers in all parts of the eastern caliphate had been growing more dependent on Turkish slave troops, which increased the flow of Turks through Transoxiana and Khurasan. This traffic in human beings became an important source of revenue for the Samanids, who issued licences and collected transit dues; at the same time the amirs became

dependent on Turkish ghuläms for their own bodyguard, seeking to use them as a counterbalance to the indigenous military class of the dihqäns.1 T o sum up: the disappearance of the native Khwärazm- Shähs and Sämänids meant the end of two firmly constituted states in the eastern Iranian world, and the result was a power vacuum. The authority of the Qarakhänids in Transoxiana and that of the Ghaznavids in Khurasan and Khwärazm had no organic roots; in the first region it was diffused and less effective than Sämänid rule had been, and in the other two regions it was despotic, capricious, and operating from a very distant capital, Ghazna, These points will be examined at greater length in the next section.

AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SALJUQS
All through their period of domination the Qarakhänids in Transoxiana remained a tribal confederation and never formed a unitary state. Their territories straddled the T'ien Shan, where their yailaqs lay, and on the facts of geography alone it is hard to see how such an empire could have been governed by one power. Originally the dynasty did have a certain unity, although there was from the start the old Turkish double system of a Great Khan and a Co-Khan. But as early as the first decades of the 5th/nth century the sources mention internecine strife in the family; and two distinct branches—which may be called after their characteristic Islamic names, the 'Alids and Hasanids—begin to emerge. After 433/1041-2 there were lines of eastern and western Qarakhänids, established at first in Baläsäghün and Uzkand respec tively, and then in Käshghar and Samarqand. Within the family there existed the complicated system of a double khanate and subordinate under-khans, so that several princes might hold power simultaneously in various regions; and the family's titulature and onomasticon, combining both Turkish tribal and totemistic titles with Islamic names and honorifics, was confused and constantly changing. The task of sorting out the genealogy of the dynasty has thus been very difficult; only the researches of the numismatist R. Vasmer and the Turcologist O. Pritsak have thrown light on it.2

THE I R A N I A N W O R L D (A.D. IOOO-I217)

In the early part of the 5th/nth century the administration of Transoxiana reverted to a pattern resembling that which had prevailed on the eve of the Muslim conquests: small city-states were scattered along the Zarafshán, and the middle Syr Darya was under the general supervision of Qarakhánid princes. With this trend towards region alism, the landed aristocracy enjoyed a resurgence of power. The dihqán of Ilaq, on the north bank of the Syr Darya, began for the first time to mint his own coins.1 The general weight and expense of ad ministration decreased. A continuator of Narshakhi, the historian of Bukhara, records that the land tax of Bukhara and its environs was everywhere lightened after the fall of the Sámánids, in part because irrigation works were neglected and land became water-logged and unproductive.2 Hence after the disappearance of the Sámánid amirs, with their centralizing administrative policy and their standing army, Transoxiana was ill-prepared to meet fresh waves of invaders from the steppes. We have seen that Khurasan passed into the Ghaznavids' hands. Towards the end of his life the restless dynamism of Sultán Mahmüd made him press westwards across Iran against his rivals the Dailami Büyids, various branches of whom ruled in western and central Iran and in Iraq (see below, section 111, pp. 25 ff.). The ShTism of the Büyids and their tutelage of the 'Abbásid caliphs in Baghdad gave the early Ghaznavids plausible pretexts for intervention in the west. They had grandiloquent plans for liberating the caliphs, opening up the pilgrimage route to Mecca and Medina, and then pushing on to attack the Shfi Fatimids in Syria and Egypt; but the Turkmen's pressure in the east ensured that these designs remained only dreams.3 It was not until 420/1029, the last year of his life, that Mahmüd came to Ray in northern Iran and deposed its Büyid ruler Majd al-Daula Rustam b. 'All (387-420/997-1029). A t the same time that the province of Ray and Jibal was being annexed, another Dailami ruler, the Káküyid 'Alá' al-Daula Muhammad b. Dushmanziyár of Isfahan (398-433/1008 to 1041-2), was made a tributary, and various petty Kurdish and Dailami rulers of north-western Persia, such as the Musáfirids of Tárum, were also forced to recognize the sultan. The Ziyárid Manüchihr b. Qábüs (403-20 or 421/1012-13 to 1029 or 1030) was already

paying tribute to Mahmüd; now he had to allow Ghaznavid armies transit through his territories and was forced on at least one occasion to contribute troops to them. (For a detailed survey of these minor Dailami dynasties, see below, section HI.) In the province of Kirmán in south-eastern Iran, which was under the control of the Büyids of Fárs and Khüzistán, Mahmüd had in 407/1016-17 attempted to set his own nominee on the throne, but without lasting success; thereafter he left Kirmán alone. One of Mas'üd b. Mahmüd's armies did temporarily occupy the province in 424/1033, but was shortly afterwards driven out by the returning Büyids.1 When Mahmüd died in 421/1030, the territory of the Ghaznavid empire was at its largest. It had become a successor state to the Sámánids in their former lands south of the Oxus, but its original centre was Ghazna and the region of Zábulistán on the eastern rim of the Afghan plateau. A s soon as he came to power in Ghazna in 366/977, SebükTegin began a series of raids against the Hindüsháhi rajahs of Vaihand, and Mahmüd gained his lasting reputation in the Islamic world as the great ghd^J (warrior for the faith), leading campaigns each winter against the infidels of the plains of northern India. Mahmüd's thirst for plunder and territory, and also his need to employ a standing army of some 50,000 men, combined to give Ghaznavid policy a markedly imperialist and aggressive bent;2 whilst from the religious aspect, the Ghaznavids' strict Sunni orthodoxy enabled the sultan to pose as the faithful agent of the caliph and to purge his own dominions of religious dissidents such as the extremist Shí'í Ismá'ilis and the Mu'taziiis. The spoils of India were insufficient to finance this vast empire; the steady taxation revenue from the heartland of the empire, Afghanistan and Khurásán, had to supplement them. Khurásán suffered most severely from the exactions of Ghaznavid tax collectors, who were driven on by the sultan's threats of torture and death for those who failed him. For some ten years, until his dismissal and death in 404/1013-14, the Vizier Abu'l-'Abbás al-Fadl Isfará'ini mulcted the merchants, artisans, and peasants of Khurásán, causing misery and depopulation. In the words of the Ghaznavid historian cUtbi, "Affairs were cha racterized there by nothing but tax levies, sucking which sucked dry, and attempts to extract fresh sources of revenue, without any construc

tive measures". Hence after a few years there was nothing more to be got in Khurasan, " since after water had been thrown on her udder, not a trickle of milk could be got nor any trace of fat".1 Mas'ud continued to act irresponsibly in Iran. When Ray had first been conquered there had been some sympathy for the Ghaznavids, for they delivered the people from the Shi'l Buyids and their turbulent soldiery. But the exactions of the Ghaznavid officials soon alienated all support: "Tash Farrash [the Ghaznavid military governor] had filled the land with injustice and tyranny, until the people prayed for de liverance from them [the Ghaznavids] and their rule. The land became ruined and the population dispersed."2 This policy of Kaubwirtschaft prevented the growth of any bond of sympathy or feelings of inter dependence between the sultan and his Iranian subjects. Loyalty and patriotism as we know them had no meaning in the Islamic world at this time, as can be seen in Mahmud's words to the people of Balkh after the Qarakhanid invasion of 397-8/1006-8: he reproached them for putting up a spirited defence against the besiegers, because some of the sultan's personal property had been destroyed in the fighting. On their side, the attitude of the merchants and landowners of Khurasan was purely pragmatic; they tolerated Ghaznavid rule as long as it could secure the external defence of the province. In Mas'ud's reign it became clear that the Ghaznavids could not provide this protection, so there was no reason for the Khurasanian cities to retain any further loyalty to them. Even as early as 397/1006, a considerable number of the dihqans and notables had inclined towards the Qarakhanid invaders.3 The Ghaznavids failed, therefore, to identify themselves with the historic interests of Khurasan, that is, with the securing of internal prosperity, an atmosphere in which commerce and agriculture could flourish, and with the preservation of the north-eastern frontier against external invaders from Central Asia. In both spheres their achievements fell short of those of earlier, Iranian rulers of the province, such as the Samanids. The racially Turkish Ghaznavids adopted the government's traditional institutions and practices, encouraged Iranian culture, and held court with the magnificence of Iranian monarchs;4 but their

identification was not deep enough, or perhaps it did not have time to develop: the sultans ruled in Khurasan for only forty years, and in Ray and Jibal for only seven or eight years. In basic outlook the sultans remained in large measure Turkish condottieriy thus the lure of India and their dreams of expansion towards Iraq and beyond distracted them from proper attention to the defence of the Oxus line. Until it was too late, the Ghaznavid sultans regarded the Turkmen as minor irritants, just one more wave of raiders from the steppes who would either sweep through Iran to regions beyond or else become absorbed into the existing economy and social structure of Persia. When the Saljuqs first appeared in Transoxiana and Khurasan in the 5th/nth century, they came as marauders and plunderers. It has been suggested that the Turkish peoples' conversion to Islam and their consequent zeal for jihad (holy war) helped them to overrun so much of the Middle East.1 It is true that in the course of the 5th/i ith century the Turkmen carried on warfare against the Byzantines and the Christian kingdoms of Armenia and the Caucasus, and that the Saljuqs achieved some prestige in the eyes of the orthodox by overthrowing Shi'i Buyid rule in western Iran. Sunni writers even came to give an ideo logical justification for the Turks' political and military domination of the Middle East. The Iranian historian Ravandi dedicated his history of the Saljuqs, the Rabat al-mdur wa dyat al-surur (" Solace of Hearts and Signal for Gladness", begun in 599/1202), to one of the Saljuq sultans of Rum or Asia Minor, Ghiyath al-Din Kai-Khusrau b. Qilij-Arslan. Ravandi tells of a hidden, supernatural voice from the Ka'ba at Mecca, which spoke to the Imam Abu Hanifa and promised him that as long as the sword remained in the hands of the Turks, his faith (that of the Hanafi law school, which was followed par excellence by the Turks) would not perish. Ravandi himself adds a pious doxology: "Praise be to God, He is exalted, that the defenders of Islam are mighty and that the followers of the Hanafi rite are happy and joyful! In the lands of the Arabs, Persians, Byzantines, and Russians, the sword is in the hands of the Turks, and fear of their sword is firmly implanted in all hearts!"2 Yet these considerations, valid though they may be for the second half of the 5th/nth century and after, have no relevance for the

preceding decades of the Saljuq invasions of Khurasan. Barthold has pointed out that the Sufi shaikhs who worked in the steppes were usually evangelical hell-fire preachers, who dangled their audiences over the pit rather than painting for them the delights of a warriors' paradise.1 Moreover, it is hard to see that the orthodox Muslim faqlhs and theologians, who came mainly from the property-owning classes, could positively have welcomed the Qarakhanids or Saljuqs. It is safest to treat this passing of Transoxiana and Khurasan into Turkish hands as acts of resignation by the landowning and religious interests, which feared the centralizing policy of the Samanid amirs more than they did the incoming Qarakhanids; moreover the merchants and landowners had despaired of getting further help against the Turkmen from the distant government in Ghazna. The Saljuqs belonged to the Oghuz Turks, who appear in history as a grouping of nine tribes, the Toquz Oghuz. These tribes formed part of the eastern Turku and are mentioned in the royal annals of the con federation, the Orkhon inscriptions of Outer Mongolia, written in the first half of the znd/8th century. When that empire collapsed in 125/741 and a fresh confederation was formed, the Oghuz chief eventually came to hold the military office of Yabghu of the " right wing of the horde ", although he never acquired the supreme title of Qaghan. Towards the end of the 2nd/8th century the Oghuz moved westwards through the Siberian steppes to the Aral Sea and to the Volga and southern Russia. With their attacks on Ushrusana in the reign of the Caliph al-Ma'mun (198-218/813-33), they come within the purview of Islamic writers.2 Some Oghuz also moved into the Dihistan steppes north of the Atrak river, and others took over the existing settlements at the mouth of the Syr Darya, where the Islamic sources of the 4th/ioth century mention three Turkish towns: Jand, Khuvar, and the " new town" of YengiKent. Most of the Turks were Oghuz, and they included both nomads and sedentaries. They acquired a certain amount of culture, for this region had economic connexions with Khwarazm and Transoxiana, but the cultural and material level of those Oghuz who were nomads between the Dihistan steppes and the Urals remained perceptibly lower. The Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan was passing through their ter ritories in 309-10/921-2 on an embassy from the caliphate to the Bulghars of the middle Volga, and he met a band of Oghuz who were

THE RISE OF THE SALJUQS
living in extreme wretchedness and wandering "like straying wild asses Ibn Fadlan met amongst them certain leaders whose titles recur in later Saljuq history; their chief had the title of Yabghu, whilst the military leader was called Sahib al-jaish (Su-Bashf or Su-Begi in Turkish), or "army leader"; and there was a subordinate commander called the Lesser Yindl. It is in the 4th/ioth century too that the term " T u r k m e n " first appears in Islamic sources; about 370/980 the geographer Maqdisi, speaking of two strongholds in the province of Isfijab, calls them "frontier posts against the Turkmen". It is not clear whether the term has a political or an ethnic denotation, but in the 5th/nth century and after it was undoubtedly applied to the south-western Turks, the Oghuz and Qipchaq, whereas the term " T u r k " is used for the more easterly Turks of the Qarluq group. Ghaznavid sources frequently call the incoming Oghuz "Turkmen", and in his "Mirror for Princes" (the Siydsat-Ndma) the Saljuq vizier Nizam al-Mulk uses the term for the tribal followers of the Great Saljuqs who had remained nomads within Iran and the lands to the west.1 According to Mahmud Kashghari, author of the pioneer TurkishArabic dictionary, the Dm an lughat al-Turk (completed 466/1074), the leading tribe of the Oghuz, from whom their princes sprang, was the Qiniq. The Saljuq family (it does not seem originally to have been any bigger social unit than this) belonged to the Qiniq.2 A t the end of the 4th/ioth century the ruler of the Oghuz was the Yabghu, who had a winter capital at Yengi-Kent in the Syr Darya delta, and whose auth ority ranged over the steppes from there to the Volga. The lower Syr Darya was at this time in the zone where Islam and paganism met, and where Muslim gha^js (fighters for the faith) were active; at one stage in their rise to power the Saljuqs themselves operated here as typical ghazis. According to the Malik-Nam a^ an account of Saljuq origins which Cahen believes to have been written for Sultan Alp-Arslan, the progenitor of the Saljuq family was one Duqaq, called Temiir-Yaligh ("iron-bow"). He and his son Saljuq served the "king of the Turks", i.e. the Yabghu, with Saljuq holding the important military office of Sii-Bashi. Certain sources state that Duqaq and Saljuq served the king

of the Khazars, whose kingdom embraced the lower Volga and southern Russia, but this seems to be merely a memory of earlier Oghuz-Khazar connexions. Eventually the Yabghu became jealous of Saljuq's power, and the latter was forced to flee with his retainers and their flocks to Jand; it was in the region of Jand, apparently in the last decade of the 10th century, that the Saljuq family became Muslim and then turned to gha%n>, or raiding, against those Turks who remained pagan, including the Yabghu of Yengi-Kent. The fierce hostility between these two branches of the Qiniq was not resolved until 433/1042, when the Saljuqs took over Khwarazm and drove out the Yabghu's son and successor, Shah Malik b. 'All (see below, section iv, p. 52).1 Over the next decades the Saljuqs (now led by the three sons of Saljuq who had reached manhood, Musa, Mika'il, and Arslan Isra'il, as well as by Mika'il's two sons Toghril Beg Muhammad and Chaghri Beg Da'ud) hired out their services to the warring factions of Transoxiana and Khwarazm, fighting for anyone who would assure them pasture for their herds. Indeed, some sources specifically say that it was pressure of population and the need for pasture which compelled them to move southwards. They can have had no thoughts of a more ambi tious role in the Iranian world, even though the Malik-Ndma (pre served in al-Husaini's historical account of the dynasty, Akhbdr al-daula al-Saljuqiyya) describes a dream in which Saljuq saw himself urinating fire, whose sparks spread all over the world: a shaman (priest-doctor) interpreted this to mean that a son of his would rule over all the world. The Yabghu of Yengi-Kent became a Muslim in 393/1003 and aided the last of the Samanids, Isma'il al-Muntasir (see p. 7 above). His Saljuq rivals, who on the fall of the Samanids had moved to pastures near Bukhara, therefore gave their services to the Samanids' enemies, the Qarakhanids. Toghril and Chaghri fought for a Qarakhanid called Bughra Khan (possibly the ruler of Talas and Isfijab, Yighan-Tegin b. Qadir Khan Yusuf) and then joined forces with their uncle Arslan Isra'il in the service of a rival Qarakhanid, 'Ali-Tegin of Bukhara and Samarqand. Their followers were now living on winter pastures at Nur Bukhara or Nakhshab, near 'Ali-Tegin's capital, moving east wards into Soghdia for the summer.2 When in 417/1026 cAli-Tegin was temporarily defeated by the united

THE RISE OF THE SALJUQS
forces of Mahmud of Ghazna and Qadir Khan Yusuf of Kashghar and Khotan, the Saljuq bands split up once more. Arslan Isra'Il's followers, comprising 4,000 tents, complained of the oppression of their own chiefs and requested permission from Mahmud to settle on the northern fringes of Khurasan near Sarakhs, Abivard, and Farava; they promised to act as auxiliaries for the Ghaznavids and to refrain from encroaching on the settled land. Either at this point or shortly afterwards, Arslan Isra'Il himself fell into Mahmud's hands and later died in prison. Toghril and Chaghri remained in the neighbourhood of Bukhara with cAli-Tegin; after 420/1029 they quarrelled with the Qarakhanid, yet in 423/1032 the Saljuqs were to be found fighting on 'Ali-Tegin's side against the Ghaznavid general Altun-Tash at the battle of Dabusiyya. When in 425/1034 'Ali-Tegin died, they moved into Khwarazm at the invitation of Altun-Tash's son Harun, who was then in virtual rebellion against Mahmud. A t this point the old enmity between the Saljuqs and the line of the Oghuz Yabghus of Yengi-Kent flared up: the Saljuqs were overwhelmingly defeated by Shah Malik of Jand, who aimed at annexing Khwarazm for himself.1 The Saljuqs' only recourse now was to follow the example of Arslan Isra'Il's band and head southwards for Khurasan. A group of 7,000 or 10,000 Turkmen were led by Toghril, Chaghri, Musa Yabghu (the Saljuqs had themselves assumed this title in rivalry to the Yabghus of Yengi-Kent and Jand), and by Ibrahim Inal, who is described as a son of ToghriPs mother and the leader of the Inaliyan, a section of the Turkmen mentioned separately in the sources. Their defeat in Khwa razm had left the Inaliyan in a state of utter wretchedness, and in 426/ 1035, in a very humble letter to Mas'ud of Ghazna's vizier, the leaders described themselves as "the slaves Yabghu, Toghril, and Chaghri, Clients of the Commander of the Faithful" and asked that the towns of Nasa and Farava be granted to them. The existing depredations caused by the wave of Turkmen who had entered Khurasan in 416/1025, the so-called " 'Iraqi" Turkmen, were now aggravated by the Saljuqs' spoliations. They sent cavalry columns into Afghanistan as far as Guzgan, Tukharistan, and Sistan, where they carried off livestock, pastured their sheep on agricultural land, and interrupted the caravan trade, generally terrorizing the towns of Khurasan and causing starva tion in both countryside and town. For the seven years 422-9/1031-8, until the town capitulated to Toghril, no sowing was possible outside

the walls of Baihaq (modern Sabzavár), and during all this time mutton was unobtainable there.1 The Ghaznavid sultans alternated between attempts at conciliation and punitive expeditions. They tried to enrol the Saljuq leaders as frontier guards against further Turkmen inroads, giving them each in 426/1035 the title Dihqdn and the insignia and dress of a governor, and they even offered marriage alliances to Toghril, Chaghri, and Musa Yabghu. But it was soon obvious that the Saljuqs, being nomads, were unfamiliar with the concepts of defined frontiers and the sanctity of landed property. During the period 426-31/1035-40 large Ghaznavid armies were almost continually in the field against the Turkmen. The sultan blamed his Turkish ghulám commanders for pusillanimity and incompetence, even accusing them of collusion with the Saljuqs. The Ghaznavid armies were better led, better armed, and probably numerically superior to the poorly armed, half-starved nomad bands, and at first glance the advantages were all on one side. Y e t though the sultan's forces scored some successes in pitched battles, they were never able to follow them up. The nomads had a clear advantage in mobility. They were unhampered by the elephants, siege machinery, and camp-following without which no Ghaznavid army could move; they were more hardened to the extremes of climate, the lack of water, and the famine conditions then prevailing in Khurasan; and they did not have to operate, as did the Ghaznavid armies, from fixed bases.2 Meanwhile, the position of the Khurásánian towns became perilous. There was little danger that the Saljuqs would storm them directly, for the nomads were unequipped for siege warfare and fought shy of it. The great cities surrendered voluntarily to them: Marv in 428/1037 and Herat and Nishápür in 429/1038 (this last was recovered by the sultan's forces and not lost again till 431/1039). In each case the notables and landowners took the initiative in making peace, having despaired of receiving adequate protection from the sultan in Ghazna, who only latterly came to Khurasan to lead his armies. Economic and commercial life was at a standstill. The 8th/15th-century historian Mirkhwánd de scribes the distressed state of the Nishápür area thus: "That region became ruinous, like the dishevelled tresses of the fair ones or the eyes of the loved ones, and it became devastated by the pasturing of [the Turkmen's] flocks."3 O f the Saljuq chiefs, only Toghril seems at this

point to^have had an eye to the future and to have adopted a states manship attitude. He had difficulty in restraining his own brother from looting Nishapur, and the task was a fortiori more difficult where the ignorant and rapacious masses of the Turkmen were concerned. On occupying Marv, however, Chaghri did give orders that tillage should be restored and refugees summoned back.1 Ghaznavid authority was declining even in the more easterly regions of Badghis and Tukharistan, where the mountainous terrain was less suitable for the nomads to operate in. Law and order broke down, 'ayydrs or brigands flourished, and the officials and leading citizens in cities such as Herat began to negotiate with the Saljuqs for the surrender of their cities.2 The final, decisive blow to Ghaznavid authority in the west came in 431/1040. A large army, led personally by Sultan Mas'ud

and accompanied by elephants and the full impedimenta of war, allowed itself to be drawn into battle at the ribdt (stronghold) of Dandanqan in the waterless desert between Sarakhs and Marv. The Turkmen fielded 16,000 cavalrymen and had left 2,000 of their less experienced and less well-mounted members to guard their baggage. Facing them was a dispirited and exhausted Ghaznavid army. In what must rank as one of the decisive battles of Khurasan's history, Mas'ud's forces were utterly routed. The Turkmen then dispersed to receive the final surrender of the cities, with Toghril going to Nishapur, Musa Yabghu and the Inaliyan to Marv, and Chaghri to Balkh and Tukharistan. Mas'ud's nerves failed completely. Resigning himself to the Saljuqs' inevitable occupation of Ghazna itself, he left for India; but his army had lost confidence in him, and the commanders deposed him when he reached the upper Indus valley, setting up his brother Muham mad b. Mahmud for a brief sultanate.1 On taking over Khurasan, the Saljuq leaders became territorial sovereigns and not merely chiefs of nomadic bands. They learned to negotiate with the rulers of other states, and they gained knowledge of the administrative techniques practised in settled states. But even for the Saljuq leaders this process of acquiring political responsibility was disturbing, for it involved a changed mode of life and a changed outlook. Sultans such as Toghril, Alp-Arslan, and Malik-Shah adapted themselves in some measure to the Iranian-Islamic monarchical tradition, leaning more and more heavily on their Iranian officials. Yet in his Siydsat-Ndma the great vizier Nizam al-Mulk lamented that the sultans were neglecting the wise administrative practices followed by the Ghaznavids and other former rulers; thus the Iranian officials were never able to mould their masters into the exact shape they would have liked. A s soon as Khurasan and western Iran had been overrun, various members of the Saljuq family were allotted regions to govern (see p. 49 below). Nevertheless their frequent rebellions—those o f Ibrahim Inal, of Qutlumush b. Arslan Isra'il, and even of the senior member of the family, Musa Yabghu—show that these provincial rulers never understood their subordinate position in the hierarchy of power that was roughly taking shape under the sultan. A s for the masses of the Turkmen, now nominally Muslim, they remained at a cultural level little higher than that which they had enjoyed in the

steppes, and their irreconcilable attitude towards any settled govern ment was kept alive by the arrival of fresh tribal elements from Central Asia, who were attracted westwards by prospects of plunder. ToghriPs first occupation of Nishápur, the administrative capital of Khurasan, elated him. He behaved as independent ruler of the province, installing himself in the sultan's palace in the suburb of Shádyákh and sitting upon Mas'üd's throne (this last profanation so roused Mas'üd that he subsequently had the throne broken up). According to the historian of the Saljuqs, 'Imad al-Din, who wrote in 579/1183, Toghril "forbade, gave orders, made grants, levied taxes, administered effi ciently, abolished things, ordered affairs correctly, entrusted matters and presided every Sunday and Wednesday over the investigations of complaints " . 1 The khutba (Friday sermon) was read in his name, and he assumed the royal title al-Sultan al-Mu'a%%am ("Exalted Ruler").2 Despite all this, it is possible that the pro-Saljuq sources which depend on the Malik-Nam a exaggerate the degree of ToghriPs political sophis tication at this time. A s late as 430/1039 the Saljuqs still had a great fear of Sultán Mas'üd's power, and they doubted whether they would be able to hold on in Khurasan; it seems that they still placed Mas'üd's name in the khutba alongside their own. But at the same time Toghril was in touch with the caliph, employing a faqih as his secretary and envoy from Nishápur. After the Dandánqán victory, this man was dispatched to Baghdad with the Saljuqs' fath-nama (formal announce ment of victory), a document written on the battlefield with materials salvaged from the abandoned Ghaznavid chancery.3

interlude" of Iranian history.1 Headed by the various branches of the Büyids, dynasties of Dailami origin flourished not merely in their Urheimat, the mountains of northern and north-western Iran, but also as far south as lower Iraq and the shores of the Persian Gulf. Intermingled with these dynasties were some Kurdish rulers, notably the 'Annázids of the Sháhanján tribe (c. 381-511/^. 991-1117), successors in Hulwán and Kirmánsháh to the Hasanüyids. Other semi-nomadic Kurds were the effective holders of power in the mountainous regions of Kurdistan and Luristán; in the eastern part of Fárs, around Dárábjird, the Shabánkára'í Kurds were especially influential. The Marwánids of Diyárbakr, Akhlát, and Malázgird (372-489/983-1096) were also of Kurdish origin, but they rose to power as vassals of the Fatimids. During the long reign of Nasr al-Daula Ahmad b. Marwán (401-53/ 1011-61), his cities of Amid, Mayyafariqin, and Hisn Kaifá in Diyár bakr enjoyed considerable material prosperity and a vigorous cultural life; an invasion of the Oghuz in 443/1041-2 was beaten off, and the annalist Ibn al-Athir records that the sense of security and the prevail ing justice in Ibn Marwán's dominions were such that people actually dared openly to display their wealth.2 A local historian of Mayyáfáriqin, Ibn al-Azraq (d. after 572/1176-7), describes enthusiastically how Nasr al-Daula lightened taxes and, as part of his charitable works, supplied the town with piped water. However, the Marwánid territories came under Saljuq suzerainty soon after Nasr al-Daula's death. They were divided between his two sons, and in 478/1085-6 Saljuq armies under Fakhr al-Daula Ibn Jahir and his son "Amid al-Daula Ibn Jahir con quered Diyárbakr (see p. 98 below).3 On the western edges of the Iranian plateau, where it merges into the plains of Iraq, al-Jazireh, and northern Syria, there were various Arab amirates including the Mazyadids of Hilla, the 'Uqailids of Mosul, and the Mirdásids of Aleppo. Militarily they depended on the Bedouins of the region; strategically they were important, first because they commanded the approaches into eastern Anatolia, Armenia, and western Iran, and second, because they were in the buffer zone between the rival dynasties of the Büyids and Fátimids and later between the

Saljuqs and Fatimids. Their religion, like that of almost all the Arabs of the Syrian desert and its fringes, was ShFi. In the fourth and fifth decades of the eleventh century these amirates were threatened by the Oghuz marauders who preceded the arrival of Toghril and the Saljuqs, and their grazing grounds were encroached upon by the Turkmen's flocks. In general they adopted a hostile attitude towards Toghril when he appeared in Iraq; the Mazyadid Dubais gave much support to Arslan Basasiri, who was his own brother-in-law (see pp. 46-7). The Dailami dynasty of the Ziyarids {c. 316-483/928-1090) reigned in the Caspian provinces of Gurgan and Tabaristan, and also at times in the province of Qumis to the south of the Alburz mountains.1 They arose from one of the fiercest and most ambitious Dailami condottieri of the early 4th/ioth century, Mardavij b. Ziyar (d. 323/935). Later in the century the Ziyarids' strategic position, commanding the routes which connected western Iran and Iraq with Khurasan and Central Asia, allowed them to play a prominent role in the struggles between the Samanids and Buyids in northern Iran. The most famous of the dynasty, Shams al-Ma'ali Qabus b. Vushmagir (366-403/977 to 1012-13), united something of his grandfather's ferocity with an enlightened love of letters and culture; some of his Arabic and Persian verses are known, and al-Biruni and Avicenna both spent some time at his court. Though Mardavij himself had been violently anti-Muslim, his successors were Sunnis (this was unusual amongst the generally Shfl Dailamis), and almost at the end of the dynasty Kai-Ka'us still called himself Mauld Amir al-Mu'minln, the "Client of the Commander of the Faithful".2 Qabus felt the pressure of the Ghaznavids and was compelled to recognize the suzerainty of Mahmud, although 'Utbi's grandiose claim, that " Jurjan and Tabaristan as far as the shores of the Caspian and the region of Dailam, by dint of the combining of circumstances, became just like one of the Sultan's own dominions", is certainly exaggerated. Falak al-Ma'ali Manuchihr b. Qabus, the original patron of the Ghaznavid poet Manuchihri Damghani, became Mahmud of Ghazna's son-in-law; he ruled somewhat uneasily in the sultan's shadow, but did succeed in retaining some freedom of action.3

With Manuchihr's death in 420/1029 or 421/1030 (the date of 424/ 1033, given by the local but non-contemporary historians Ibn Isfan diyar and Zahir al-Din Mar'ashi, is too late), the Ziyarid dynasty ceased to count for anything outside the specific boundaries of Gurgan and Tabaristan. A t this point the family's chronology and order of succession become confused and uncertain.1 O f all the existing ac counts—in Ibn Isfandiyar, Zahir al-Din Mar'ashi (whose material here derives from the former source), Ibn al-Athir, and Baihaqi—only the last is contemporary. It seems that Manuchihr's son Anushirvan succeeded, but since he was a minor, effective power was held by his maternal uncle and chief minister, Abu Kalijar b. Vaihan al-Quhi. This man was Mas'ud of Ghazna's father-in-law, but in 425/1034, while the sultan was away in India, he seized the opportunity to ally with the Kakuyid 'Ala' al-Daula of Isfahan, and together they cut off tribute and rebelled. The violent behaviour of a Ghaznavid punitive expedition, which was sent in the next year and which penetrated as far westwards in Tabaristan as Natil, alienated all sympathy for Mas'ud in the Caspian provinces.2 Despite this disharmony, A b u Kalijar and the sultan had a common interest in warding off the Turkmen, for the line of the Atrak river and the Dihistan region had been from early Islamic times a thaghr (frontier region) against the Turkmen of the Qara-Qum and beyond. Abu Kalijar maintained contact with Mas'ud till 431/1040; there after he had to make his own terms with the Saljuqs, but in fact all mention of him now disappears from the sources. In 433/1041-2 Toghril arrived in Gurgan accompanied by one Mardavij b. Bishui; this man and Anushirvan b, Manuchihr divided power between them selves, placing Toghril's name in the khutba and paying an annual tribute to him.3 Shortly afterwards a collateral branch of the Ziyarids took over, continuing as Saljuq vassals. From 441/1049-50 until a date after 475/1082-3 the ruler was 'Unsur al-Ma'all K a i - K a u s b. Iskandar, author of another famous "Mirror for Princes", thtQabusNdma. Before coming to the throne, he had spent some years in Ghazna as a boon-companion of Sultan Maudud b. Mas'ud, but he also had connexions with the north-western corner of the Iranian world: he

had fought in Armenia and Georgia with the Shaddadid amir Abu'lAsvar Shavur b. Fadl (d. 459/1067), lord of Dvin and Ganja (see below, pp. 34-5), and he spent some time amongst the Shaddadids.1 It is probable that Kai-Ka'us ruled only in the mountainous interior of Gurgan and Tabaristan while nominees of the Saljuqs held the coast. His son Gilan Shah was the last of the line; the chief of the Assassins of Alamut, Hasan-i Sabbah, conquered the mountain regions of Tabaristan, and after c. 483/1090 the Ziyarids disappear from history.2 Ibn Isfandiyar records that Tabaristan suffered much during the reign of the Saljuq sultan Alp-Arslan, because his troops moved frequently through the region. (This was in the seventh decade of the century: see pp. 64 ff., below.) However, the Ziyarids' western neigh bour, the Bavandid Ispahbadh Qarin b. Surkhab, was able to con solidate his power in the mountains. Thus it was the coastal plain w
Thich suffered, whilst the mountains either remained in the hands of local chieftains or else fell under Assassin control. In the 5th/nth and 6th/12th centuries the Caspian provinces often served as a corridor for the passage of nomads from Central Asia, but the coastal lands were unsuitable for their permanent settlement: the damp and malarial climate of the region and its dense vegetation and forest are singled out for mention by many of the Islamic geographers, and one writer calls Gurgan "the graveyard of the people of Khurasan".3 D o w n to the nineteenth century the raids and transits of the Turkmen must have retarded agriculture, though the fertility of the area gave it considerable natural resilience. The Bavandid Ispahbadhs (45-750/665-1349) had their roots in the pre-Islamic Iranian past, for they sprang from the Sassanian Ka'us b. Qubadh, brother of Anushirvan the Just. Their Ka'usiyya branch reigned till 397/1006-7, followed by the Ispahbadhiyya from 465/1073 till 606/1210; and then, under Mongol suzerainty, the Kinkhwariyya held sway from 635/1237 onwards. They ruled in Tabaristan (or Mazandaran, as it became known in the course of the 6th/12th century),4 often relinquishing control of the plains to rulers such as the 'Alid

Da'is, the Buyids, and the Ziyarids; but they retained authority in the mountains. The Ka'usiyya reigned from Firim or Shahriyar-Kuh in the mountains to the south-west of Sari, and they were Shi'is, as the formula on their coins—"'Ali is the Friend of God"—shows.1 The last Ispahbadhs of this line were connected by marriage to the Buyids and Ziyarids; one of them was Rustam b. Marzban (d. }407¡1016-17), author of a well-known collection of fables, the Mar^bdn-Ndwa, and a vassal of the Buyid Majd al-Daula of Ray. The line ended in 397/1006-7, with the death of Shahriyar b. Dara at the hands of Qabus b. Vushmagir. Other members of the Bavandid dynasty survived, and as the Ziyarids gradually lost control of the Caspian littoral to the Turkmen invaders, the Ispahbadhiyya entrenched themselves in the mountains. In the early Saljuq period they extended down to the coast; in the third quarter of the n t h century Rustam b. Shahriyar founded a madrasa, or college, at Sari, which became the capital of their principality. These Ispahbadhs were generally vassals of the Saljuqs; in the reign of Sultan Muhammad b. Malik-Shah, for example, there was a son of the Ispahbadh Husam al-Daula Shahriyar b. Qarin at the court of Isfahan, and another son married one of the sultan's sisters. On the other hand, they were not invariably servile towards their suzerains. When the same Saljuq sultan sent an expedition against the Isma'llls of Alamut, Shahriyar was offended by the sultan's peremptoriness, refused all help, and routed a Saljuq punitive force sent against him. This expedition was probably in 501/1107-8 or 503/1109-10 under the sultan's vizier and Amir Chavli; see section V I I I , pp. n 8-19, below.2 During the 6th/12th century the Caspian provinces frequently fulfilled one of their historic roles, that of a refuge area, with the Bavandids giving shelter to various Saljuq contenders for the sultanate, as well as to a Ghaznavid prince, to the sons of the Khwarazm-Shah Qutb al-Din Muhammad b. Anush-Tegin, and even to the son of the Mazyadid Sadaqa b. Mansur. With the decline of Saljuq power, the Ispahbadh Shah Ghazi Rustam b. 'Ali (5 34-5 8/1140-1 to 1163) became a major figure in the politics of northern Iran, pursuing an independent policy aimed at the expansion of his principality. He campaigned each

year against the Isma'llls of Alamut and led one unsuccessful expedition against the Oghuz of the Dihistan steppe. Zahir al-Din Mar'ashi calls him the richest and greatest of the rulers of Tabaristan: he con quered Gurgan and Qumis, and his power in the west extended as far as Mughan. He helped the Saljuq Sulaiman-Shah to gain the sultanate (see below, pp. 169 and 176), and in reward he was given Ray and Saveh. Shah Ghazi's grandson Husam al-Daula Ardashir b. Hasan (576-602/1171-2 to 1205-6) aided Sultan Toghril b. Arslan and the atabeg Pahlavan Muhammad b. Eldiguz (see p. 179 below), and he also had friendly relations with the Khwarazm-Shah Tekish b. II Arslan, the Ayyubid Saladin, and the Caliph al-Nasir. But pressure from the aggressive Khwarazm-Shahs became hard to resist, despite the Ispahbadhs' attempts to conciliate them by marriage alliances. In the reign of Nasir al-Daula Rustam b. Ardashir, the Isma'Ilis overran most of the Bavandid territories in Tabaristan, and when in 606/1210 he was assassinated, the Khwarazm-Shah 'Ala' al-Din Muhammad seized the Caspian provinces and the Ispahbadhiyya line of the dynasty came to an end.1 The Baduspanids were western neighbours of the Bavandids in Tabaristan, ruling for nearly a thousand years (c. 45-1006/665 to 1597-8) in the mountains of Rustamdar, Ruyan, N u r , and Kujur, and bearing the princely titles of Ispahbadhs and Ustfmddrs. The dynasty, which traced its origins to a Sassanian governor of the Caspian provinces, vanished only when the Safavid Shah 'Abbas exterminated its last members. A t times the Baduspanids recognized Saffarid and Buyid suzerainty, and later they were generally subordinate to the Bavandids. Shahrnush b. Hazarasp (510-23/1116-17 to 1129) married a sister of Shah Ghazi Rustam, and his brother Kai-Ka'us b. Hazarasp (523-60/ 1129-65) was also an ally of the Bavandids and a resolute foe of his neighbours the Isma'llls; but unlike the Ziyarids and Bavandids, the Baduspanids obtruded little on Iranian affairs outside their own corner of the Caspian region. Ibn Isfandiyar says that it was Kai-Ka'us b. Hazarasp and his descendants who became followers of the Sayyid Abu'l-Husain al-Mu'ayyad Billah, yet according to Zahir al-Din Mar'ashi it was not until a Badiispanid of the 9th/15 th century imposed

Shi'ism on Ruyan and Rustamdar that most of the population there adopted that faith.1 Between Tabaristan in the east and Azarbaijan and Mughan in the west lay Gilan and Dailam. Strictly speaking, Gilan was the coastal plain and Dailam the mountainous interior through which ran the Safid Rud and Shah Rud, but up to the 5th/nth century the Muslims applied the term Dailam to the whole region. Islam was late in coming here; the Dailami mountaineers were notorious for their depredations in the settled lands to the south of the Alburz, and Qazvin was long regarded as a thaghr against these infidels. In the early part of the 3rd/ 9th century Dailam was a centre forc Alid propaganda, and the local people were gradually won over to Shi'ism. Here then is why the majority of Dailami dynasties in the 4th/ioth and 5th/nth centuries were Shi'i.2 The 4th/ioth century was the period of the Dailamis' greatest expansion; in the next century they tended to give way in Iran to Turkish dynasties such as the Ghaznavids and Saljuqs. The oldest of the Dailami dynasties was that of the Justanids, who ruled at Rudbar. Some seven or eight members of the family are known, the first of whom was mentioned in 189/805 when the Caliph Harun al-Rashid received at Ray the submission of "the lord of Dailam". But the dynasty declined as their rivals of the Kangarid or Musafirid family grew more powerful in Dailam. The last Justanid ruler definitely known was defeated by the Dailami general Asfar b. Shiruya (d. ? 319/ 931). However, the dynasty may have survived much longer than this, for in 434/1042-3 Toghril Beg received at Qazvin the submission of the " K i n g of Dailam", and Kasravi has surmised that this was a surviving member of the Justanids. Less certain is a mention by the Persian traveller Nasir-i Khusrau, who passed through the region in 437/1046; he spoke of "the Amir of Amirs, who is from the Kings of Dailam", but this may refer to one of the Musafirids.3 The Musafirids or Sallarids were originally and more correctly called Kangarids.4 They arose in Dailam in the early years of the 4th/ioth

century through the efforts of Muhammad b. Musafir, who was allied by marriage to the older dynasty of the Justanids, and whose power grew at the latter's expense. A contemporary Buyid source says that it was this marriage connexion plus the acquisition of the fortress of Samiran in the region of Tarum which established the Musafirids' fortunes.1 Samiran was then one of the key fortresses of Dailam, just as Alamut was to be in Saljuq times, and several Islamic travellers and geographers described its wonders. After the deposition of Muham mad b. Musafir in 330/941, there were two lines of Musafirids. One remained in the ancestral centre of Tarum; the other expanded north wards and westwards into Azarbaijan, Arran, and eastern Trans caucasia. This branch pushed as far as Darband on the Caspian coast, but its power was eventually destroyed by the Rawwadids. The Tarum branch lost Samiran to the Buyid Fakhr al-Daula in 379/989, but they recovered it on that ruler's death, and in the period of his son Majd al-Daula's minority, the Musafirids pressed southwards to Zanjan, Abhar, Suhravard, and Sarchahan.2 The ensuing decades of Musafirid history are very dark, but the dynasty was directly threatened when in 420/1029 Mahmud of Ghazna seized Ray (see p. 12 above). Against the Musafirid Ibrahim b. Marzban the sultan sent a " descendant of the Kings of Dailam", probably a Justanid, and then Mas'ud b. Mahmud came in person and captured Ibrahim. Although a Ghaznavid garrison was left in Tarum, by 427/1036 it was again in Musafirid hands.3 The early Saljuqs did not try to establish direct rule in Dailam, but were content to exact tribute; then in 434/1042-3 Toghril came west wards, retrieved Ray from the hands of his half-brother Ibrahim Inal, and gained submission from "the Salar of Tarum" on the basis of 200,000 dinars' tribute. Nasir-i Khusrau speaks with admiration of Samiran and of the security and justice prevailing in the lands of the "Marzban al-Dailam, Jil-i Jilan, A b u Salih [Justan b. Ibrahim], Maula Amir al-Mu'minin". In 454/1062, shortly before his death, Toghril went to Samiran and again took tribute from the local ruler Musafir. After this the sources are quite silent about the dynasty, and it is likely that the line was extinguished when, as the geographer

Yàqût relates, the Ismâ'ïlïs of Alamùt destroyed the fortress of Samïrân.1 The Rawwâdids (latterly the form " R a w â d " is commoner in the sources) were another product of the upsurge of the mountain peoples of northern Iran; their domain was Âzarbâïjân, and particularly Tabriz. Strictly speaking, the Rawwâdid family was of Azdï Arab origin, but by the 4th/ioth century they were accounted Kurdish. A t the opening of the 'Abbâsid period Rawwâd b. Muthannâ had held a fief which included Tabriz. Over the course of the next two centuries his descendants became thoroughly Kurdicized, and the "Rawwâdï Kurds" emerged with Iranian names, although the local poet Qatrân (d. c. 465/1072) still praised them for their Arab ancestry. Early in the 4th/ioth century the Sâjid line of Arab governors in Âzarbâïjân collapsed, and the region became politically and socially disturbed. A branch of the Musâfirids of Târum first emerged there, but despite Bi yid help the Musâfirid Ibrahim b. Marzbân was deposed in c. 370/ o',o-i, probably by the Rawwâdid Abu'l-Haijâ' Husain b. Muhammad (344-78/955-88); certainly it was the Rawwâdids who succeeded to all of the Musâfirid heritage in Âzarbâïjân.2 The most prominent member of the dynasty in the 5th/nth century was Vahsûdân b. Mamlân b. Abi'1-Haijâ' (c. 410-46/*;. 1019-54). It was in his reign that the Oghuz invaded Âzarbâïjân. These were some of the first Turkmen to come westwards, being the so-called " c I r a q i s " , or followers of Arslan Isrâ'ïl, expelled from Khurâsân by Mahmûd of Ghazna (see pp. 38 and 40-1). Vahsûdân received them favourably in 419/1028, hoping to use them as auxiliaries against his many enemies, such as the Christian Armenians and Georgians and the rival Muslim dynasty of Shaddâdids. He even married the daughter of an Oghuz chief, but it still proved impossible to use the anarchic nomads as a reliable military force. In 429/1037 they plundered Marâgheh and

massacred large numbers of Hadhbânï Kurds.1 Vahsûdân allied with his nephew, the chief of the Hadhbânis, Abu'l-Haijâ' b. Rahib al-Daula, against the Turkmen; many of them now migrated southwards towards Iraq, and in 43 2/1040-1 Vahsûdân devised a stratagem by which several of the remaining leaders were killed. The rest of the Oghuz in Âzarbâïjân then fled to the territory of the Hakkârï Kurds south-west of Lake Vân. Vahsûdân's capital, Tabriz, was destroyed by an earthquake in 434/1042, and fearing that the Saljuqs would take advantage of his resulting weakness, he moved to one of his fortresses ; but the city was soon rebuilt, and Nâsir-i Khusrau found it populous and flourishing.2 Despite Vahsûdân's apprehension, a considerable time elapsed before the Saljuqs themselves moved against Âzarbâijân. Meanwhile the main threats came from independent Turkmen bands who passed continuously through the province towards Armenia and the Caucasus; it was in 437/1045 that Qubâdh b. Yazid, ruler of Shirvan in the eastern Caucasus, was forced to build a defensive wall round his capital Yazidiyya.3 In 446/1054 Toghril at last resolved to bring Âzarbâïjân and Arrân under his sway. Vahsûdân, making no attempts at opposition, handed over his son as a hostage. The sultan then passed to the Shaddâdid capital of Ganja and also received the homage of other minor rulers of eastern Transcaucasia before pressing westwards into Anatolia as far as Malâzgird and Erzerum.4 In 450/1058 the eldest of Vahsûdân's sons, Mamlân, was confirmed by Toghril in his father's territories, but the last days of the dynasty are obscure, as indeed is most of the history of Âzarbâïjân at this time. The Ottoman historian Mûnejjim Bashï (d. 1113/1702), whose vast historical compilation incorporates some ancient and otherwise lost sources for the history of north-western Iran and the Caucasus region, says that the Rawwâdids came to an end in 463/1070-1 when AlpArslan returned from his Anatolian campaign (see pp. 63-4 below) and deposed Mamlân. However, one later member of the family is known: Ahmadil b. Ibrâhïm b. Vahsûdân held Marâgheh and took part in the Crusading warfare in Syria, and the name Ahmadil was perpetuated by the line of his own Turkish ghulâms, who began to

rule at Maragheh after his death in 510/1116. (For these Ahmadilis see below, pp. 170-1 The Shaddadids of Arran and D v i n (c. 340-468/951-1075) were almost certainly Kurds, as Munejjim Bashi suggests. They arose from a Kurdish adventurer called Muhammad b. Shaddad, who established himself in Dvin in the middle of the 4th/ioth century, the town being held at that time by the Musafirids. The ethnic origins of the family are complicated because its members frequently adopted Dailami names, such as Lashkari and Marzban, and even the Armenian one of Ashot; but their basic Kurdishness seems very likely, and the variety of their onomasticon is doubtless a reflexion of the confused ethnic and political condition of the region.2 Muhammad b. Shaddad could not hold on to Dvin, but in 360/971 his sons Lashkari and Fadl dis placed the Musafirids by agreement with the notables of Ganja. Fadl eventually secured power in Arran and reigned there for close to half a century (375-422/986-1031). Armenian sources stress his violence and military vigour: he recovered Dvin, fought the Georgian Bagratids and the Armenian rulers of Ani, Alvank' (Albania), and Tashir, and he subdued the Hungarian Sevordik' in the upper Kur valley. His construction of a fine bridge over the Araxes in 421/1030 points towards ambitions against the Rawwadids in Azarbaijan. FadPs son and grandson had to cope with attacks from the Georgians, from other Caucasian mountaineers such as the Alans or Ossetes, from the Russians, and the Rawwadid Vahsudan b. Mamlan. In about the year 440/1048-9 there was a Byzantine invasion under the eunuch Nicephorus, aimed principally at the Shaddadid branch in Dvin. Ominous, too, was the appearance of the Oghuz, from whom the Rawwadids south of the Araxes suffered severely. The historians al-cAzimi and Ibn Duqmaq record an attack by Qutlumush b. Arslan Isra'Il on Ganja in 438/1046-7, and there may have been other incursions which have not been noted in the chronicles.3 The Shaddadids reached their zenith under Abu'l-Asvar Shavur b. Fadl, who ruled in Dvin from 413/1022 to 441/1049 and then in Ganja till 459/1067. The Byzantines' devastation of the Dvin area probably

influenced his decision to leave Dvin, where he had faced Armenian princes on his west and south. In 434/1042-3 or 435/1043-4, at the instigation of the Byzantine emperor, Abu'l-Asvar invaded the principality of Ani and thereby acquired a great contemporary reputa tion as a "warrior for the faith", praised for his courage and sagacity by the Ziyarid Kai-Ka'us b. Iskandar, who fought with him as a ghazi against the Christians. Abu'l-Asvar submitted to Toghril in 446/1054-5, and towards the end of his life he was associated with Turkmen expansion into Armenia and Anatolia; in 457/1065 he be came governor of Ani, which had been captured from the Christians in the previous year.1 Before that he had been involved with his neigh bours the Shirvan-Shahs. In the latter half of the 2nd/8th century the Arab family of the Yazldids had governed Arran for the 'Abbasids.2 During the ensuing decades they were pushed northwards by Dailami pressure, becoming completely Iranian in their way of life, and though they acquired close marriage connexions with the Shaddadids, these did not prevent Abu'l-Asvar from invading the territories of his nephew the Shirvan-Shah Fariburz b. Sallar (455-after 487/1063-after 1094) on four separate occasions during these years.3 In the end, the extension of Saljuq power into this north-western region, under the leadership of Alp-Arslan and his ghulam com mander 'Imad al-Din Sav-Tegin (? Shad-Tegin), proved fatal to the Shaddadids. Abu'l-Asvar's son Fadl II was captured by the Georgians, and the Shirvan-Shah invaded Arran. A n army under Sav-Tegin passed through Arran in 460/1068, and seeing internal dissensions within the Shaddadid family, the sultan allotted fiefs in Darband and Arran to his general. Sav-Tegin once more appeared with an army, this time in 468/1075, and Fadl III b. Fadl II was obliged to yield his ancestral territories. This ended the main line of the Shaddadids, though the members of a junior branch, descended from Abu'l-Asvar's son Manuchihr, became governors on behalf of the Saljuqs in Ani, and the family can be traced there till the Georgians recaptured the town in 556/1161.4

THE I R A N I A N W O R L D (A.D. IOOO-I217)
36
We have noted that on the eve of the Saljuq invasions, the western and central parts of the country were in the last phase of the Dailami ascendancy in Iran: indeed the principal Dailami dynasty, that of the Buyids, was already in a state of confusion and decay when Toghril moved westwards from Khurasan. The Buyids had brought with them from their Caspian homeland a patrimonial conception of power in which each member of the dynasty acquired a share of territory and power; from the very start there had been three Buyid principalities in Iran. Moreover, since the Buyids came to rule over such scattered provinces as the Iranian ones of Jibal, Fars, Khuzistan, and Kirman, and the Arab ones of Iraq and even Oman, the lack of geographical cohesion in their empire undoubtedly favoured the dispersal of political power among several members of the family. In the middle decades of the 4th/ioth century the Buyids were held together by family solidarity, which was furthered by the energy and capability of such amirs as the original three sons of CAH b. Buya and those of the next generation, including 'Adud al-Daula Fana-Khusrau (d. 372/983) and Fakhr al-Daula 'AH (d. 387/997). But cAdud al-Daula made plans to perpetuate after his own death the unified rule which he had achieved in his lifetime, and the family henceforth became fragmented and divided against itself. Militarily the Buyids at first depended for infantrymen on their fellow Dailamis, supplemented by Turkish cavalrymen; but in the 5th/nth century the recruitment of Dailami soldiers seems to have dwindled (the reasons for this are unclear) and the amirs became almost wholly dependent on Turkish mercenaries, over whom they frequently lost control.1
On the religious plane the Buyids' tenure of power was definitely favourable to the consolidation of cAlid and Twelve Shi'I organization and doctrine, but with the rise of the Turkish d) .asties in eastern Iran, intellectual as well as political trends were no longer so clearly helpful for the Buyids. Political Shrism was clearly failing to gain power in the eastern Islamic world, and even the successes of the Nizari Isma'Ilis were to be fairly limited geographically. In addition, the caliphate of al-Qa'im (422-67/1031-75) witnessed a certain revival of 'Abbasid power, at least in Iraq; here in 437/1045-6, after a century in which the caliphs had been politically impotent under Buyid control,
1 Cf. Bosworth, "Military organisation under the Buyids of Persia and Iraq", Oriens, vol. XVIII (1968). There exists no special monograph on the Buyids, but a valuable pro visional survey is given by C. Cahen in his "Buwayhids", Encyc. of Islam (2nd ed.).

al-Qa'im appointed a forceful, strongly Sunni vizier, the Ra'is alRu'asa' Abu'l-Qasim Ibn al-Muslima.1 Intellectually the Sunni revival had already been visible in several phenomena, such as the madrasabuilding movement, the gradual rise to respectability of the Ash'ari kaldm or theological system (although it was a long time before this process was completed), and the vitality of the conservative and traditionalist law school of Hanbalism. The incoming Saljuq rulers enthusiastically aided the progress of this revival.2 The territories held by the Buyids in 421/1030 were still extensive. The most serious inroads on their possessions had been made in northern and central Iran. Ray and Jibal had not been under strong rule since Fakhr al-Daula's death, when power there had been divided between his two young sons, Majd al-Daula at Ray and Shams al- Daula at Hamadan and Kirmanshah. Majd al-Daula was an ineffectual ruler, and in practice his territories were governed by his mother Sayyida. After her death ^419/1028, he was unable to keep order or control his troops, and he foolishly appealed to Mahmud of Ghazna for help. This request was the pretext for Mahmud's Jibal campaign. In 420/1029 he sacked Ray, deposed Majd al-Daula, and carried him and his son off as prisoners to Khurasan, installing a Ghaznavid governor in Ray. From here, operations were carried out against the Musafirids of Tarum. The area to the south and west of Ray, including Isfahan, Hamadan, and Kirmanshah, had passed out of Buyid control before this time, but into the comparatively friendly hands of the Kakuyids, another dynasty of Dailami origin which was closely connected to the Buyids.
The Kakuyids exercised considerable, if transient, authority in central Iran. The founder of the line, Rustam b. Marzban Dushmanziyar, attracted the favour of the Buyids of Ray by helping them against the Ziyarids. His son 'Ala' al-Daula Muhammad3 was first appointed by the Buyids to govern Isfahan, and he later adopted this as the capital of his principality.4 After 398/1007-8 he was virtually independent of Buyid control, extending his power over the towns of Hamadan, Dinavar, and Shabur-Khwast. From Tabaristan to Khuzistan, Ibn Kakuya was continually involved in warfare, and, with the resources

(1949), PP- 3I3~I4.

of the rich cities of central Iran at his disposal, he hired mercenaries. Thus in 42 8/1 o3 7, in preparation for an attack on the Ghaznavid-held city of Ray, he was using his wealth to recruit not only local Kurdish and Dailami troops but also the " 'Iraqi" Turkmen, these last comprising some who had come directly from the Balkhan-Kuh area to the east of the Caspian together with others who had just fled westwards from Nishapur. Indeed, Ibn Kakuya's dynamism was a major factor in the brevity of Ghaznavid rule in western Iran. Although he was twice driven from Isfahan, by Mas'ud of Ghazna in 421/1030 and by another Ghaznavid army in 425-7/1034-6, his resilience was such that on each occasion he re-established himself, and the sultan had to recognize him as his vassal. It was the growing power of the '"Iraqi" Turkmen in northern and central Iran which curbed Ibn Kakuya's ambitions. Deflected from Azarbaijan by the Rawwadid Vahsudan b. Mamlan and the Kurdish chieftain Abu'l-Haija' b. Rahib al-Daula, two groups of these Oghuz turned to attack Ray (428/1037 or 429/1038) and Hamadan (430/10389). Shortly afterwards, the Kakuyids became Saljuq vassals. On the battlefield of Dandanqan in 431 /1040, Toghril awarded Ray and Isfahan to Ibn Kakuya's son Abu Mansur Faramurz; on Ibn Kakuya's death in 43 3/1041-2 Faramurz succeeded him in Isfahan, and Faramurz's brother Abu Kalijar Garshasp was given Hamadan. Faramurz attempted to keep on equal terms with both the Saljuqs and the Buyid al-Malik al-Rahim, yet he only managed to exasperate Toghril. In 442/1050-1 the sultan besieged and captured Isfahan and moved his capital thither from Ray; in exchange, Faramurz received Yazd and Abarquh, while Garshasp lost Hamadan and Kangavar to Ibrahim Inal and died in exile amongst the Buyids in Khuzistan.1 Later descendants of Fara murz adapted themselves more smoothly to Saljuq masters. His son Mu'ayyid al-Daula 'All, ruler of Yazd, married one of Chaghri Beg's daughters, and in 488/1095 he died fighting for Tutush b. Alp-Arslan against Berk-Yaruq (see below, p. 107). 'Ali's son 'Adud al-Din A b u Kalijar Garshasp also held Yazd, and, being high in Muhammad's favour, he married a sister of Sultans Muhammad b. Malik-Shah and Sanjar; but Sultan Mahmud b. Muhammad dispossessed him of Yazd, and henceforth he became a fierce partisan of Sanjar, urging him in 513/1119 to join battle with Mahmud at Saveh (see below, pp. 135-6).2

The Buyid territories in Iraq and southern Iran were broadly divided between Jalal al-Daula Abu Tahir Shirzil and his nephew 'Imad al-Din Abu Kalijar Marzban in 421/1030. The former was Amir al-Umara or "Supreme Commander"—as the Buyid rulers in Iraq called themselves—in Baghdad and the rest of Iraq excepting Basra, but though he ruled from 416/1025 to his death in 435/1044, his authority was never very firm. It is true that in Baghdad the caliph did not yet feel strong enough to exert much political pressure. In 429/ 1037-8 al-Qa'im was powerless to prevent Jalal al-Daula from assuming the ancient Sassanian title of Shahanshdh ( " K i n g of K i n g s " ) , although five years later his opposition to the amir's appropriation of poll-tax revenues collected in Baghdad from the People of the Book (i.e. Christians and Jews) did deter the Buyid from trying to take them again the next year.1 The real holders of power in the city were the violent and undisciplined Turkish and Dailami soldiery, the opposing Hanbali and Shfi mobs, and the ubiquitous 'ayyars.2 Furthermore, a good proportion of the Turkish troops supported the claims of Abu Kalijar, who ruled in Basra, Khuzistan, Fars, Kirman, and Oman. In the years after 423/1032, Jalal al-Daula was thrice expelled from his own capital by pro-Abu Kalijar forces; on one Friday in the year 428/1037, the khutba in Baghdad was made for four different persons, the caliph, Jalal al-Daula, Abu Kalijar, and the 'Uqailid Qirwash b. al-Muqallad. After this, however, the two Buyid rulers made peace, and 'Iraq was comparatively peaceful until Jalal al-Daula's death in 435/1044.3 The vigorous Abu Kalijar was master in his Iranian territories to an extent that Jalal al-Daula never enjoyed in Iraq. A s well as his father's heritage of Khuzistan and Fars, he fell heir to the adjoining province of Kirman when in 419/1028 his uncle Qiwam al-Daula Abu'l-Fawaris died, and this province he successfully defended against an incoming Ghaznavid army. Jalal al-Daula had intended that his son Abu Mansur

Khusrau Firuz, called al-Malik al-'Aziz (d. 441/1049), should succeed him, but al-'Aziz's ineffectual character was no match for his cousin Abu Kalijar's military and financial resources. It was A b u Kalijar alone who was able to pay the haqq al-baica, or the subsidies demanded by the Buyid troops on the accession of a new ruler, and for the last four years of his life, until his death in 440/1048, he was ruler of the whole of the Buyid possessions in Iraq and southern Iran.1 Towards the end of his reign, Abu Kalijar realized that the Turkmen were becoming a major threat to his dynasty, and indeed, within fifteen years of his death, the Turks were to extinguish the independent rule of the Dailamis. We have already touched upon the raids of the Oghuz into western Iran and beyond. Several Christian sources—such as Matthew of Edessa, Samuel of Ani, Vardan, and the continuator of Thomas of Ardzrun, as well as a Muslim source that depends on the Ma/ik-Ndma—all of these place the first penetration of Armenia at a date between 407/1016-17 a n < ^ 412/1021, when Turkmen under the leader ship of Chaghri Beg ravaged the district of Vaspurakan between Lakes Van and Reza'iyeh. But this is almost certainly too early.2 The stimulus for these movements by the Oghuz was Mahmud of Ghazna's seizure of Arslan Isra'il (c. 418/1027), after which his Turkmen followers spread out in various directions plundering aimlessly. Since many of these came to western Iran, which is often called in early Muslim sources 'Iraq-i 'Ajam "Persian Iraq", they became known as the 'Iraqi Turkmen. Although the names of several of their leaders are known, it does not seem that they had any one outstanding leader; thus they were a more anarchic group than those Turkmen headed by the Saljuq leaders. Over the next few years the various Oghuz bands were a turbulent factor in the politics of central and western Iran, where Ghaznavids, Buyids, Kakuyids, and local Kurdish chiefs endeavoured to use them against their rivals. The insecurity of this period prompted the construc tion of town walls in various places: in 429/1038 'Ala' al-Daula Ibn Kakuya fortified Isfahan, and between 436/1044-5 and 440/1048-9 the Buyid 'Imad al-Din Abu Kalijar put a wall round Shiraz for the

first time in its history;1 rich cities such as Ray and Hamadan were other natural targets for the predatory Oghuz. By themselves the Turkmen were militarily and psychologically unfitted for siege war fare (p. 20 above), yet they could benefit from temporary alliances with one or another side in local disputes. It was because of a triple alliance against him, consisting of the Oghuz, the Buyid Fana-Khusrau, who was a son of the dispossessed Majd al-Daula, and finally the Dailami ruler of Saveh, Kam-Rava, that Ibn Kakuya was forced to evacuate Ray after taking it over from the Ghaznavids in 428/1037. A fearful slaughter followed, and this was repeated in 420/1038-9 when the Oghuz and Fana-Khusrau's Dailamis captured Hamadan, expelling Ibn Kakuya's son Garshasp. Prudently, the inhabitants of Qazvin bought off the Oghuz for 7,000 dinars.2 Armenia, Diyarbakr, al-Jazireh, and Iraq likewise suffered from the Oghuz, who spread out from Azarbaijan after Vahsudan treacher ously massacred several of their leaders in 43 2/1040-1. The establish ment of Ibrahim Inal at Ray in 43 3/1041-2, and then at Hamadan the next year, drove more numbers of the 'Iraqi Turkmen out of Jibal into Iraq and al-Jazireh. It seems that Toghril and the Saljuq leaders were already endeavouring to exercise some control over the whole body of Turkmen in the Iranian world, and this was being resisted by the anarchistic 'Iraqis. When Toghril came westwards he notified Gok-Tash, Bughra, and other leaders, then he encamped at Zanjan, hoping to win them over. But they were too suspicious, and told him: " We realize full well that your intention is to seize us if only you can get hold of us. It is fear of you which has made us stay apart and en camp here, and if you persist in trying to get your hands on us, we will make for Khurasan or Rum, and will never under any circumstances join up with y o u . " Toghril nevertheless regarded himself as overlord of all the Oghuz, and in 435/1044, after Gok-Tash's followers had savagely sacked Mosul, he wrote to Jalal al-Daula, the ruler of 'Iraq, excusing the Turkmen's conduct; they were, said Toghril, mere dependents of the Saljuqs, rebellious slaves who deserved severe punishment.3

CONSOLIDATION OF THE EASTERN CONQUESTS
After settling affairs in Khwárazm and the Caspian provinces, Toghril came westwards to Jibal in 434/1042/3 and took over from Ibrahim Inal the city of Ray, which was to serve briefly as his capital.1 Ibrahim Inal now moved into Kurdistan to conduct operations against the Káküyids and the Kurdish 'Annázids, but he was already showing signs of the rebelliousness that was to lead to his downfall. In 441/ 1049-50 he was arrested by Toghril, then later released and restored to favour; on this occasion Toghril gave him the choice of staying with him or of being allocated a territory which he could carve out as his own principality.2 The Oghuz successes in Iran and the consequent crumbling of Ghaznavid and Büyid defences inevitably attracted more Turkmen from Central Asia; indeed, the westward deflexion of unruly elements was now becoming one of ToghriPs instruments of policy. We are badly informed about the tribal affiliations of the Turkmen in Iran at this time. After their appearance in the accounts of Saljuq origins, the Qiniq disappear wholly from mention. The 7th/13th-century Armenian historian Vardan calls Toghril "leader of the Doger", another Oghuz tribe, who, unlike the Qiniq, did play a significant role in northern Iran; and Cahen has suggested that in his capacity as chief of a coalition of tribes, Toghril might be considered the head of the Doger. Only in the 6th/i2th century do we have some informa tion about the activities of individual Oghuz tribes,3 though we do know that in the middle decades of the 5th/nth century there had been a considerable influx of Central Asian elements into northern Iran and thence to the borders of Armenia and Byzantium. From this same period dates the especial importance of Azarbáiján as a base for Turkmen expansion. This area lay at one end of the route through Ray and northern Iran along which Turkmen passed from Khurasan and beyond, and its fertile valleys—Azarbáiján is one of the few regions of Iran where dry farming can be practised to any con siderable extent—provided pasture for the nomads' herds. Political authority in the region was fragmented, which gave numerous oppor

tunities for employment in the service of local rulers. Moreover, as a frontier province sharing a border with Christian powers, Azarbâïjân had long-established traditions of ghâzi warfare, in which families like the Shaddâdids were prominent, as we have seen. All these factors combined to make Azarbâïjân a concentration-point for the Turkmen, and at this period it began to acquire the Turkish ethnic and linguistic colouring which it still has today,1 Over the next century or so, ghâzi elements from this area put pressure on the Christian kingdoms of Armenia and Georgia, while at the same time they infiltrated into Anatolia, founded ghâzi states such as those of the Dânishmanids and Mangujekids, and laid the foundation for a Saljuq sultanate at Rum which would endure for many decades after the Great Saljuqs had disappeared from Iran and Iraq. It is unlikely that the Saljuq Sultans Toghril and Alp-Arslan conceived of their mission in the west as an all-out offensive against Christian Armenia, Georgia, and Byzantium.2 Their main interests were, first, to occupy and bring under direct control the rich lands of ancient Iranian civilization: Khurâsân, Jibâl, and Fârs; and second, they wanted to hold Iraq as a bastion against the Fâtimids and their satellites in Syria and al-Jazireh. Warfare in Armenia and Anatolia was therefore left primarily to the Turkmen and ghâzïs, troublesome and undisciplined marauders whose presence in the settled lands of Iran and Iraq would have been an embarrassment to the sultans. Ibrahim Inal does not represent the more mature outlook of the sultans, but on one occasion he expressed what must have been their desires. In 440/1048 he sent a large body of Oghuz ghâzïs from Transoxiana to raid Byzantium. He told them previously, " M y territory [the region of Hamadân and Hulwân] is not extensive enough to support you or provide for your needs. The most sensible policy for you is to go and attack Rum, fight in the way of God, and gain booty. I will follow after you and assist you in this." He and Qutlumush b. Arslan Isrâ'ïl then led them personally as far as Malâzgird, Erzerum, and Trebizond, eventually capturing the Georgian prince Liparit (called in the Islamic sources "[Li]fârït").3

Yet this policy was not of infinite applicability. Many tribal leaders viewed with suspicion the moves by Toghril and Chaghri to appro priate the rich land of Iran for themselves, as well as their claims to a general control over all the Oghuz. Ibrahim InaPs own jealousies and ambitions could not be stilled, and it is clear that he represented a substantial body of conservative Turkmen feeling. ToghriPs magnani mity was now stretched to breaking point. In 451/1059 Ibrahim Inal and the two sons of his brother Er-Tash rebelled, at a time when affairs in Baghdad and Iraq were critical for Toghril, and the latter had to appeal for help from Chaghri's son Alp-Arslan in Sistan, who came with his brothers Qavurt and Yaquti. When the revolt was suppressed, Ibrahim Inal was found strangled with a bowstring; Ibn al-Jauzi adds that Toghril had now destroyed all trust and loyalty on the part of the Turkmen.1 Sporadic Turkmen revolts, such as those of Ibrahim Inal, of Qutlumush and his brother Rasul-Tegin, together with events in 'Iraq and Iran, prevented Toghril himself from taking much part in the raids against Rum. In 446/1054 he went to Azarbaijan to receive the homage of the Rawwadids and Shaddadids, at Tabriz and Ganja respectively. He then led his forces into the region of Van and against Trebizond and Kars, but without decisive result, and with the onset of winter the siege of Malazgird had to be lifted.2 In the following years Qutlumush and Yaquti were raiding Armenia and eastern Anatolia, and ^450/1058 Kars and Malatya fell. Just before his death Toghril appeared briefly in Azarbaijan (454/1062), but in general he was content to leave the conduct of warfare in the hands of Yaquti.3 ToghriPs other great concern was his position vis-a-vis the Buyids and the caliph. Toghril and 'Imad al-Din Abu Kalijar, leader of Khuzistan and Fars, had come to an understanding: the Saljuq had restrained Ibrahim Inal from raiding Buyid territory in Luristan and Fars and had married one of Abu Kalijar's daughters, whilst the Buyid's son Fulad-Sutun had married one of Chaghri's daughters

(439/1047-8).1 Abu Kalijar died the next year, before he could recover his province of Kirman from the Saljuq Qavurt b. Chaghri Beg, and he was succeeded by his eldest son Khusrau Firuz, who took the title al-Malik al-Rahzm ("the merciful king"). It was fortunate for ToghriPs ambitions that al-Malik al-Rahim's succession was disputed by his brother Fulad-Sutun, for a period of internal strife within the Buyid family now ensued, in which several of A b u Kalijar's sons (at least nine of them are known) took part. Al-Malik al-Rahim was never able to rule outside Iraq, and Fars and Khuzistan were generally in the hands of Fulad-Sutun and several other brothers. It was inevitable that one of the contending parties should call in the Saljuqs. In 444/1052-3, Oghuz raiders had penetrated as far as Shiraz. In the next year FuladSutun inserted ToghriPs name in the khutba in his capital of Shiraz for the first time, and in 446/1054-5 Toghril sent a group of Turkmen to take over Khuzistan.2 We have seen that when in 426/1035 the three Saljuq leaders crossed the Oxus, they styled themselves "Clients of the Commander of the Faithful", and that when he captured Nishapur and assumed the title of "Exalted Sultan", Toghril opened up diplomatic relations with the caliphate (pp. 19 and 23 above). The Saljuqs soon saw the weakness of Buyid rule in Iraq. In 441/1049-50 Saljuq pressure compelled Nasr al-Daula Ibn Marwan to put ToghriPs name in the khutba in Diyarbakr,3 and northern Iraq, already much ravaged by Oghuz raids, was open to attack by the Saljuqs. ToghriPs march to Baghdad has often been viewed as a Sunni crusade to rescue the caliph from his Shici oppressors, and it is true that it was the Shfi proclivities of a Turkish commander in Baghdad, Arslan Basasiri, which prompted al-Qa'im's appeal to Toghril. We can only guess at ToghriPs inner motives, but it is surely relevant to note that his Iranian advisers included many officials from Khurasan, the most strongly Sunni part of Iran. The sources give varying lists of the viziers who are said to have served Toghril, but the backgrounds of these men are predominantly Khurasanian, and most of them started their careers with the Ghaznavids. Thus the Sahib Husain Mikali, whom Ibn al-Athir includes in his list, entered the Saljuqs' service some time after being captured from the Ghaznavids; he came from a prominent Nishapur family which had

produced a long line of Hanafi scholars and traditionists as well as administrators.1 The most famous of ToghriPs viziers was the 'Amid al-Mulk Abu Nasr Kunduri, who had been recommended to Toghril shortly after the latter's occupation of Nishapur. Kunduri was a fierce Hanafi, and when Toghril gave permission for the khutba in Khurasan to include the cursing of the Shi'a, Kunduri added the cursing of the Ash'aris, who tended to be of the Shafi'I law school; this caused prominent scholars such as al-Qushairi and Abu'l-Ma'ali al-Juvaini to flee to the Hijaz.2 Hence there is much justification for regarding the early years of the Great Saljuq sultanate as strongly Sunni and Hanafi in ethos and outlook. Al-Malik al-Rahim's seven-year reign in Baghdad (440-7/1048-55) was racked by continual violence and rioting, with hostility polarized around the figures of the caliph's Vizier Ibn al-Muslima on one side, and the Turkish general Abu'l-Harith Arslan Basasiri on the other. The vizier accused Basasiri of being in touch with the Fatimid caliph of Egypt, al-Mustansir (427-87/1036-94), the 'Abbasids' great rival, and it is true that a Fatimid da'i (agent), al-Mu'ayyad fi'l-Din Shirazi, became very active in Iraq shortly after this time.3 In 447/105 5 Toghril was assembling forces at Hamadan, Dinavar, Kirmanshah, and Hulwan, and he now announced his intention of making the pilgrimage to Mecca and then of mounting a crusade against the Fatimids. Al-Malik al-Rahim and the caliph accepted ToghriPs appearance at Baghdad in Ramadan 447/December 1055, but the Buyid prince was unable to preserve his power: he was arrested and deposed by Toghril that same month, and spent the remaining four years of his life in Saljuq captivity.4 In this fashion, the rule of the Dailamis in "Iraq was ex tinguished after over a century's tenure of power, although Buyid rule continued for a few years more in Fars. At this time Fulad-Sutun was ruling in Fars with the support of the Vizier Abu Mansur al-Fasawi, called Muhadhdhib al-Daula, but chaos increased there with the rise of a chieftain of the Shabankara'I Kurds,

Canard, "al-Basasiri", Hncyc. of Islam (2nd ed.). 4 Bundari, Zubdat al-nusra, pp. 10-11; Ibn al-Athir, al-Kdmil, vol. ix, pp. 418-22; Barhebraeus, Chronography, pp. 207-9; Mirkhwand, Raudat al-safd\ vol. iv, pp. 105-6; Bowen, J.R.A.S.

Abu'l-'Abbas Fadluya, who in 454/1062 overthrew and killed FuladSutun, setting up one of the latter's brothers as a Buyid puppet ruler. However, Fadluya was defeated in this same year by a Saljuq army from Kirman under Qavurt; the khutba in Shiraz was then made in Toghril's name and the rule of the Buyids finally ended there.1 Another of A b u Kalljar's sons, Abu cAli Fana-Khusrau, prospered under later sultans, residing on his fief atNaubandaj an in Fars, enj oying the privileges of a standardanda salute of drums, and dying full of days and honour in 487/1094. The sources also mention one of Jalal al-Daula's sons, Abu Mansur cAli, who held the fiefs of al-Mada'in and Dair al-'Aqul in Iraq until 490/1097.2 In 'Iraq, Basasiri had allied with his brother-in-law the Mazyadid Dubais in an open campaign under the Fatimid white colours, having received an investiture patent from al-Mustansir in Cairo. Toghril remained in Baghdad for thirteen months without personally meeting al-Qa'im, all communication being handled by their respective viziers. After campaigning in al-Jazireh, Toghril entered Baghdad once more, and at the end of 449/beginning of 1058 he was at last received by the caliph. Tmad al-Din describes at length the splendour of the occasion, during which al-Qa'im bestowed on Toghril the honorifics Rukn alDaula (" Pillar of the State ") and Malik al-Mashriq waH-Maghrib (" K i n g of the East and West"), together with seven robes of honour in the 'Abbasid colour of black and two crowns signifying rule over the Arabs and 'Ajamis.3 Later the distraction caused by Ibrahim InaPs rebellion allowed Basasiri and the 'Uqailid Quraish b. Badran to re enter Baghdad in 450/end of 1058, when they attracted strong popular support, both Sunni and Shi'i; now the Fatimid khutba was made, the caliph expelled, and the old enemy Ibn al-Muslima savagely executed.4 A year passed before Toghril was able to return. Basasiri had been abandoned by the Fatimids and, in the final battle, by Dubais too, and in 451/1060 he was killed. Thus Fatimid ambitions in Iraq were finally thwarted and a decisive check placed first on the Shi'i element in Baghdad (where the Saljuqs now carried out an intensive purge) and second on the Shfl-tinged Arab amirs of Iraq.5

Toghri'1's campaigns in Iraq not only relieved the caliph of his enemies, but also crystallized the new division of power and influence in the central lands of the Ddr al-Isldm. This duality—between the caliph-imams as spiritual heads and the Saljuq sultans as secular rulershad eventually to be recognized in Islamic constitutional theory, although it had not occurred in time to be considered in the famous treatise of al-Mawardi (d. 450/1058), al-Ahkdm al-sultdniyya ("The Principles of Government"). Toghril seems to have exulted in his role as deliverer of the caliph: a document of 454/1062, issued by Toghril's chancery and quoted by the Baghdad historian and theologian Ibn al-Jauzi, is headed, "From the exalted Emperor of Emperors, King of the East and West, Reviver of Islam, Lieutenant of the Imam, and Right Hand of the Caliph of God, the Commander of the Faithful".1 He now sought to draw the two houses more closely together. In 448/1056 al-Qa'im had married one of Chaghri's daughters, Arslan Khatun Khadija; Toghri'1 himself aspired to marry one of the caliph's daughters. That an 'Abbasid bride should be given to a rough Turk men was, however, a different matter, and al-Qa'im replied that such alliances were not customary amongst the caliphs. T o the importunings of Kunduri, which were supported by the caliph's own daughter Arslan Khatun, al-Qa'im proudly replied, " W e are the children of al-'Abbas, the best of mankind; both the Imamate and temporal leadership shall remain in us until the Day of Resurrection. He who supports us will be guided aright, but he who opposes us will fall into error". Yet to the caliph's moral authority Toghril could oppose a judicious measure of force majeure. The caliphate at this time was relying finan cially on gifts from outside powers and their envoys, on the sale of honours, and on revenues granted to them by the secular rulers of Iraq. On Toghril's orders, Kunduri threatened to sequestrate the caliph's iqtd's (estates), leaving him only with those which his father al-Qadir had possessed.2 al-Qa'im had no alternative but to comply, and in 454/1062 the marriage contract was made at Tabriz by Toghril's representative, the Ra'Is al-'Iraqain Abu Ahmad al-Nihawandi, and by that of the caliph, Abu'l-Ghana'im b. al-Muhallaban. The sultan himself was absent in Armenia, and did not meet his wife in

Baghdad until the following year, 455/1063, shortly before his death at Ray.1 The conventional eulogies on his death stress ToghriPs piety and clemency on the one hand, and his vigour, even harshness, on the other. We need only note that it was surely a remarkable man who, in a life span of seventy years, could rise from a hand-to-mouth existence as a nomadic chief to a position of sovereignty over lands extending from Kirman to Diyarbakr. A t the time of his death the regions of Anatolia, northern Syria, and the Caucasus still provided ample scope for the energies of ghazis and tribesmen, although the Turkmen revolts which Toghril had to quell were a reminder that the Saljuq leaders' progress from steppe chieftains to monarchs in the Iranian style would not be untroubled. Whilst Toghril was occupied with the west, Khurasan and the east remained under the control of Chaghri Beg, according to the division of authority made by the Saljuqs after the Dandanqan victory. Chaghri was allotted Khurasan and all the lands north of the Oxus that he might conquer, while Marv became his capital; down to the end of Sanjar's reign, Marv was to remain the centre of Saljuq administration for the east. If he could wrest them from the sultans, Musa Yabghu was to have the frontier territories which accompanied the Ghaznavid empire: i.e. Herat, Pushang, Isfizar (Aspuzar), Ghur, Sistan, and Bust; but his main efforts were in fact to be directed in the direction of Sistan (see below, pp. 50-1). Qavurt, Chaghri's eldest son, was to expand south wards and occupy Kirman, Kuhistan, and Tabas, the latter being an important fortress and trading-post on the route that skirted the great salt desert and connected Khurasan with Kirman. Ibrahim Inal, Qutlumush b. Arslan, and Chaghri's other two sons, Yaquti and AlpArslan, accompanied Toghril westwards.2 Chaghri thus remained ruler in the east until his death in 452/1060, though in the final years his son and successor Alp-Arslan took an increasing share in the business of ruling. Noting the paucity of information in the sources on Chaghri's personality and his system of government, Cahen has concluded that he was a somewhat colourless person.3 He docs seem to have been content with the very extensive

power which he wielded in the east, and was never tempted into the acts of rebelliousness which characterized the careers of so many lesser Saljuq amirs. Toghril, suzerain of the whole of the Saljuq dominions, was without male heir, and thus it was almost certain that one of Chaghri's own sons would succeed to the unified sovereignty of east and west, which in fact happened under Alp-Arslan. The two brothers always remained on friendly terms. Chaghri accepted ToghriPs intervention in Sistan on behalf of Musa Yabghu and his son, and when Ibrahim Inal rebelled, Toghril received valuable help from Chaghri's sons. Chaghri had wide responsibilities in the east. Beyond the Atrak and the Oxus, Dihistan and Khwarazm had to be defended against Qipchaq pressure and a possible revival of Qarakhanid activity. But relations with the Ghaznavids were his foremost concern. Only gradually over the next few decades did the Ghaznavid sultans become reconciled to the permanent loss of their Khurasanian provinces. Ibrahim b. Mas'ud is said to have mourned his inability to recover the lost territories: " H e used to say, ' I f only I had been in my father Mas'ud's place after the death of my grandfather Mahmud, the bastions of our kingdom would not have collapsed. But now, I am too weak to regain what they have taken, and neighbouring kings with extensive terri tories and powerful armies have conquered it.'"1 Sistan had been ruled in the 4th/ioth century by amirs descended from collaterals of the Saffarid brothers Ya'qub and c A m r b. Laith. But in 393/1002 Mahmud of Ghazna deposed the Amir Khalaf b. Ahmad (d. 3 99/1008-9) and annexed Sistan to his empire. The unknown but very patriotic author of the Ta'rikh-i Sistan, a local history of the province, regards the coming of the Turks, i.e. the Ghaznavids, as a major disaster for his country.2 Because of feelings like this, Sistan under Ghaznavid rule was usually racked by the activities of patriotic 'ayyars. Mas'ud ruled Sistan through a scion of the Saffarid dynasty, Amir Abu'1-Fadl Nasr. Turkmen raids on Sistan are recorded from c. 427/ 1036 onwards, and soon afterwards the Saljuqs were definitely called in by some Sagzi rebels against the Ghaznavids. Er-Tash (d. 440/ 1048-9), who is described as a brother of Ibrahim Inal, came and compelled Abu'1-Fadl to make the khutba in the name of Musa Yabghu, who was then in Herat; after Dandanqan, Musa came in person to Sistan. Abu'1-Fadl remained faithful to his new Saljuq masters: his

TOGHRIL AND THE BUYIDS
brother Abu Nasr Mansur married a Turkish princess, and when in 432/1041 Sultan Maudud b. Mas'ud of Ghazna (43 2-41/1041-50) sent an army into Sistan, Abu'1-Fadl and Er-Tash eventually repulsed it decisively. Abu'1-Fadl also purged the land of Ghaznavid sympathizers, who seem to have been especially well represented amongst the religious classes.1 The frontier between this south-easternmost outpost of Saljuq influence and the Ghaznavid empire was finally stabilized in the lower Helmand valley between Sistan and Bust. In 434/1042 Maudud repulsed an attack on Bust by Abu'1-Fadl and Er-Tash, but it was Sultan 'Abd al-Rashid b. Mahmud who took the offensive in this region. In 443/1051-2 his slave general Toghril invaded Sistan and drove out Abu'1-Fadl and Musa Yabghu, w h o were forced temporarily to flee to Herat.2 Saljuq suzerainty was re-established in Sistan, but it seems that Chaghri Beg now asserted his own superior rights over Sistan, first sending his son Yaquti and then in 448/1056-7 coming personally to Zarang, the capital of Sistan, where he minted his own coins. Relying on his position as ruler of Khurasan and the east, Chaghri clearly hoped to reduce Musa Yabghu to a subordinate status in which Sistan should be held as an apanage of Khurasan. But later in that year, Musa appealed to Toghril as supreme head of the Saljuq family. Toghril, who was in 'Iraq, thereupon sent Musa a patent of investiture for Sistan and ordered that the khutba and the sikka (right of coinage) should both be in Musa's name, as before. Musa's son Qara-Arslan Bori resumed these rights on his father's behalf, and the local administration of the province remained in the hands of the Saffarid Abu'1-Fadl until his death in 46 5 /107 3, when his son Baha' al-Daula wa'l-Din Tahir took over.3 Towards the middle of Mas'ud of Ghazna's reign, Khwarazm had fallen under the control of rebellious governors, who had taken advantage of the province's geographical isolation and its remoteness from Ghazna. It came briefly into the hands of Harun b. Altun-Tash Khwarazm-Shah, and then, after his murder in 426/1035, into those of his brother Isma'il Khandan. Both of them lent their support to the Saljuqs—e.g. Harun supplied them with arms and beasts of burden—for they were enemies of the Ghaznavids.4 Shah Malik, the Oghuz ruler of Jand, therefore allied with Mas'ud, and in 429/1038

the sultan sent him a patent of investiture for Khwarazm, with the implicit invitation to overthrow Isma'Il. In the winter of 43 2/1040-1 Shah Malik marched across the desert into Khwarazm to assert his claim, and after a long and singularly bloody battle, he went to the capital and proclaimed the khutba for Sultan Mas'ud, although by this time Mas'ud was in fact dead.1 The Saljuqs had meanwhile taken over Khurasan, and were now able to turn their attention to Khwarazm and settle scores with their ancient enemy. Toghril and Chaghri combined for this campaign, and in 433/1042 they drove Shah Malik from Khwarazm. He fled with his forces across the Dihistan steppe to Kirman and Makran, and Pritsak has surmised that he was unable to return to his former territories in the Syr Darya delta because these had now passed into the hands of the Qipchaq. Eventually Shah Malik was captured in Makran by ErTash, who had been securing Sistan; he was then handed over to Chaghri, who killed him. Khwarazm was placed under a Saljuq governor, and the only other information recorded about this region during the rest of Chaghri's lifetime is a revolt by the governor of Khwarazm, which was suppressed personally by Chaghri at the end of the fifth decade of the eleventh century. In the course of this campaign, Chaghri also received the submission of the "Amir of Qipchaq", who became a Muslim and married into Chaghri's family.2 * A s well as securing the defence of his south-western frontier in the Sistan and Bust area, Maudud of Ghazna managed to halt the Saljuqs in north-western Afghanistan and even to push them back temporarily. He drove them from Balkh, Herat returned to Ghaznavid allegiance, and Tirmidh, the important bridgehead on the Oxus, remained in his hands for some years more. A n army which he had fitted out for the reconquest of Khurasan was in 435/1043-4 defeated by Alp-Arslan, but Maudud's prestige was so great that the " K i n g of the Turks in Transoxiana" (probably the Qarakhanid Bori-Tegin, the later Tamghach-Khan Ibrahim b. Nasr of Samarqand) submitted to him, and eventually Maudud married one of Chaghri's daughters.3 Towards the

end of his reign he planned another revanche against the Saljuqs in Khurasan, by means of subsidies and promises of territory which stirred up several of their enemies. The Káküyid former ruler of Hamadán, Abü Kálijár Garshásp, sent a contingent of troops, while the "Kháqán, King of the Turks" (doubtless Bori-Tegin again), with his commander Qashgha, attacked Tirmidh and Khwárazm respectively. Unfortunately for Maudüd, these strategies came to naught with his own death. A t some time before his death, Tirmidh had been finally lost to the Ghaznavids; the Saljuqs were now in possession of the upper Oxus valley as far as Qubádhiyán and Vakhsh, and these regions were now entrusted to one of Alp-Arslan's officials, A b ü 'All b. Shádhán.1 The decade 1050-60 was a troubled one for the Ghaznavids. O f the four short reigns in it, the most important were those of 'Abd alRashid b. Mahmüd (441-4/1050-3) and Farrukh-Zád b. Mascüd (44451/105 3-9), and these two were separated by the short but violent usurpation of the throne by the Turkish slave commander Toghril.2 The fact that the Saljuqs derived no great advantage from these disturbances shows that they had reached the natural geographical limits of their expansion in the east. Indeed, at one point 'Abd al-Rashid successfully launched a counter-attack, defeating Chaghri and forcing the Oghuz to withdraw for a while from Sistán and Kirmán (see above, p. 51). Farrukh-Zád repelled Chaghri's forces from Ghazna and captured several important Saljuq commanders before he in turn was defeated by Alp-Arslan. Thus the warfare was in general indecisive, and the two sides were fairly evenly balanced. Farrukh-Zád's brother and successor, Ibrahim b. Mas'üd, accordingly made a formal peace treaty with Chaghri.3 Ibrahim's long reign marked a period of prosperity and consolidation for the Ghaznavid empire, and the frontier with the Saljuqs remained essentially stable during his lifetime.4 The Ghaznavid empire was henceforth based upon the two centres of Ghazna in Afghanistan and Lahore in northern India; from the time of the reign of Maudüd these are the only two mints recorded for the Ghaznavids, in contrast to the multiplicity of mints used in the previous reigns.5

Before he died, Toghril seems to have designated as his successor Chaghri's younger son Sulaiman, a virtual nonentity who is hardly mentioned in the sources before this. Yet the union of both eastern and western lands under one Saljuq sultan surely demanded the strongest possible man at the top. Direct, unified rule by one man had never before been achieved, and there were powerful centrifugal forces at work in the Saljuq dominions, including the ambitions of other members of the Saljuq family and the naturally anarchical tendencies of the Turkmen. These latter considerations were probably in the minds of several Saljuq slave commanders, whose own interests lay in a strong central authority and the maintenance of a powerful professional army. T w o such men, Yaghi-Basan and Erdem, proclaimed at Qazvin the succession of Sulaiman's brother, Abu Shuja' AlpArslan Muhammad. Sulaiman himself was the candidate of Toghril's vizier and adviser, the 'Amid al-Mulk Kunduri, who doubtless hoped to perpetuate his own influence in the state; it was patent that if AlpArslan came to the throne, it would be the star of his own vizier and protege, Nizam al-Mulk, which would rise, whereas that of Kunduri would fall. The percipient Nizam al-Mulk therefore threw his weight into the struggle on his master's side, and since Alp-Arslan already had possession of Khurasan and was obviously superior in military experience, Kunduri and Sulaiman had to yield. Speedy recognition of Alp-Arslan's claim was imperative at this point, for Qutlumush and a large Turkmen following were lurking in the Alburz mountains to the south of the Caspian, awaiting the chance to descend on the key cities of Ray and Qazvin and thus seize power.1 Alp-Arslan's succession was duly effected, and Kunduri's fall was now inevitable. Shortly after the new sultan's accession in 455/1063, Kunduri was arrested and later executed on the prompting of Nizam al-Mulk. Kunduri is said to have reflected philosophically that his old master Toghril had given him secular power, and now his nephew was going to give him a martyr's crown for the next world; but he warned Nizam al-Mulk with the words, " Y o u have introduced a reprehensible innovation and an ugly practice into the world by executing a [dismissed] minister and by your treachery and deceit, and you have not fully considered what the end of it all will be. I fear that

ALP-ARSLAN'S REIGN

this evil and blameworthy practice will rebound on the heads of your own children and descendants." The cA b basid caliph's assent was now secured for Alp-Arslan's assumption of the sultanate. In his embassy Alp-Arslan tactfully allowed Toghrii's widow, the daughter of al-Qa'im, to return home; he never attempted to emulate his uncle and contract a liaison with the 'Abbasids, nor does it seem that he ever even visited Baghdad. The caliph agreed to designate the new sultan "Trusted Son", and he bestowed on him the honorifics cAdud al-DauIa ("Strong A r m of the State") and Diyd9 al-Din ("Light of Religion") in 456/1064.1 Alp-Arslan's reign of ten years (455-65/1063-73) and the succeeding twenty years' rule of his son Malik-Shah form the apogee of the Great Saljuq sultanate. During these decades the Saljuq dominions were united under the rule of one man, and the energetic and unceasing journeys and campaigns of the sultans meant that this unity was far from theoretical. Irán was now enjoying an intellectual and cultural florescence as well as a considerable commercial and agricultural prosperity. The chaos caused by the Turkmen and their flocks was alleviated both by the policy of diverting them westwards as far as possible, and also by the Saljuq governors' control over the provinces. After the great famine and pandemic of 448-9/1056-7 (its effects were felt in regions as far apart as Egypt, the Yemen, and Transoxiana), Iran was relatively free of the plagues and other misery which had earlier come in the wake of warfare and other devastation.2 There are indications that in the cities of Khurasan, firmer rule and internal pacification checked the endemic violence of the 'ayyars and the sectarian factions ^asabiyydf). According to the historian of Baihaq, Ibn Funduq, Malik-Shah's death was followed by a period of bloody sectarian strife and the dominance of 'ayyárs in the towns.3 For Iran as a whole, however, trade with Central Asia and the Qipchaq steppe, together with trade through Kirmán and the Persian Gulf, was facilitated. Although there may have been a decline in the commerce of the Persian Gulf during the 5th/nth century—Lewis has surmised that the diversion of trade from India to South Arabia, the Red Sea,

and Egypt was a deliberate, anti-'Abbâsid policy on the part of the Fâtimids of Cairo—Kirmân nonetheless prospered under the descendants of Qavurt. In the last decades of the 5th/nth century and the early ones of the next, the towns of Kirmân or Bardasir and Jiruft enjoyed great mercantile activity, and their commercial quarters contained colonies of foreign traders from as far afield as Byzantium and India.1 This combined period of thirty years may also be characterized as the age of the great Vizier Nizâm al-Mulk, or al-Daula al-Ntgamyya as Ibn al-Athir specifically calls it, and it is worth pausing to consider this outstanding figure of Iranian history. Not only was he mentor to the Saljuq sultans, encouraging them to act as sovereign monarchs in the Iranian tradition, but in his Siyâsat-Nàma or " Book of Government" he provided a precious source of information on the political ethos of the age and on the administrative and court procedures then prevalent in eastern Islam. He typifies the class of Iranian secretaries and officials upon whom the sultans relied, and his book is not merely a theoretical "Mirror for Princes" but also a blueprint according to which Nizâm al-Mulk hoped to fashion the sultan and his empire. A b u 'Ali Hasan b. 'Ali Tûsï (408 or 410-85/1017 or 1019-92) was given the honorific Ni%am al-Mulk ("Order of the Realm") at some point early in his career, perhaps by Alp-Arslan in Khurasan. Like so many of the Saljuqs' Khurâsânian servants, he had begun as an official of the Ghaznavids. He never ceased to have as his ideal the centralized despotism of the Ghaznavids, and in the Siyâsat-Nâma it is not surprising to find forceful monarchs such as Mahmud of Ghazna and the Bùyid cAdud al-Daula continually held up as models for the Saljuqs to emulate. Nizâm al-Mulk's family background and early life are welldocumented by Ibn Funduq, for the family had marriage connexions with the Sayyids of Baihaq.2 His studies with the Imam Muwaffaq, one of the outstanding Shâfi'ï 'ulamâ of Nïshâpûr, helped to form his enthusiasm for both the Shâfi'ï law school and the Ash'arï kalâm, while his zeal for education, and for these two fields of knowledge in particular, were later put into practice by his extension of the madrasa system (see pp. 72-4 below).

ALP-ARSLAN'S REIGN
57
After the expulsion of the Ghaznavids from Khurasan, the young Nizam al-Mulk spent three or four years in Ghazna and then entered the service of Chaghri and Alp-Arslan in his native Khurasan. It may be that he saw himself as a representative of the Persian dihqan and official classes, with a duty and mission to perpetuate the traditions of those classes by civilizing their Turkish masters and thereby preserving Iran from Turkmen anarchy. On the death of Alp-Arslan's vizier, Abu 'All b. Shadhan, Nizam al-Mulk took over the post, and thus with Chaghri's death he became the administrator of all Khurasan. We have seen that his fame aroused the jealousy of Toghril's vizier, Kundurl, who attempted to push the candidature of Sulaiman and so prevent Alp-Arslan and Nizam al-Mulk from gaining supreme power in the Saljuq dominions. During Alp-Arslan's reign Nizam al-Mulk had a free hand in directing the administration of the empire; in addi tion, he spent much time on military duties, accompanying his master and also undertaking expeditions of his own, such as those of 459/1067 and 464/1071-2 in Fars, whose success greatly increased his prestige. Bowen has tabulated five main points of policy in Alp-Arslan's reign, although, he says, whether they were formulated by the sultan himself or by his minister is uncertain.1 First, the Turkmen were employed for raiding the Christian kingdoms of Asia Minor and the Caucasus, as well as the lands of the Shi'i Fatimids in Syria; hence at the outset of his reign, when his position as sultan was far from secure, Alp-Arslan thought it wise to lead a campaign into Georgia and Armenia (see below, p. 62). Second, the irresistibility of the sultan's forces was demonstrated—coupled, however, with clemency towards and the reinstatement of rebels who submitted. Next, local rulers, both Sunnis and Shi'is, were maintained in such regions as Iraq, Fars, Azarbaijan, and the Caspian provinces, while members of the Saljuq family were used as provincial governors. Fourth, to prevent the kind of crisis that had occurred on Toghril's death, there was the early appointment of Malik-Shah as vali cahd (heir) even though he was not the eldest son. And finally, good relations were established with the 'Abbasid caliphs. Bearing these policies in mind, we shall now consider the events of the reign, so far as they relate to the history of the Iranian world, under the three headings of dynastic affairs in the heartlands of the empire; the campaigns in the west; and the securing of the east.

58
When Alp-Arslan obtained the throne, the most immediate problem was to secure it against his uncle Qutlumush b. Arslan Isra'Il. In his claim Qutlumush had voiced the old Turkish idea of seniorate, or the right of the eldest competent male member of the family to have supreme control: " By right, the sultanate should come to me, because my father was the senior and leading member of the tribe."1 There is no doubt that this argument appealed to many of the Turkmen. Qutlumush raised the standard of revolt at Saveh in 456/1054, accom panied by his brother and by large numbers of Turkmen. Against him, Nizam al-Mulk fitted out for the sultan an army whose chief com manders were, as their names show, slave soldiers; prominent among them was the eunuch Sav-Tegin, who became one of Alp-Arslan's most trusted generals. In this way the two opposing sides exemplified the dual aspect of the Saljuq military and ruling institution: on one side there were the free-ranging, independent, tribally organized Turkmen; and on the other was the new, professional army of the sultan, predominantly slave soldiers whose only loyalty was to the sultan, on whom they depended for their salaries or for grants of land. With typical Turkmen disregard for the agricultural economy of the region, Qutlumush devastated the neighbourhood of Ray, but was defeated in battle and was afterwards found dead in mysterious circumstances.2 Difficulties also arose in Alp-Arslan's reign when another important member of the Saljuq family, the sultan's own elder brother QaraArslan Qavurt, ceased to be content with a subordinate position. Kirman had formed part of the Buyid territories in southern Iran held by cImad al-Din A b u Kalijar (see above, p. 39). The origins of Saljuq rule in the province are not very clear, for the accounts in Ibn alAthir and in Muhammad b. Ibrahim's special history of the Saljuqs of Kirman do not coincide in all points, and the opening pages of the latter work are in any case lost. But the Ghaznavid defeat of Dandanqan certainly allowed Saljuq raiders to penetrate southwards through Kuhistan and the towns of Tabas and Qa'in in order to attack the oases of Kirman province. Whether it was Ibrahim Inal or Qavurt who was attacking Bardasir, the chief town of Kirman, in

434/1042-3 is unclear, but the Buyid vizier Muhadhdhib al-Daula was sent out from Fars to defend it, and it seems to have remained in Buyid hands for a few years more. However, shortly before Abu Kalijar's death in 440/1048-9, the Dailami commander of Bardasir, Bahram b. Lashkarsitan, delivered the capital into Qavurt's hands.1 In this way the rule of Qavurt and of his descendants became established in the province for the next 140 years, and until the irruption of the Ghuzz in the latter half of the 6th/12th century, Kirman enjoyed a period of comparative stability and prosperity—especially since it lay on the overland trade-route from Khurasan to the Gulf and to the lands farther east. Muhammad b. Ibrahim stresses Qavurt's just rule: the Turkmen were allotted fiefs in Kirman, but the amir himself was care ful to pasture his own extensive flocks well out in the steppe, where agricultural land would not be damaged. He also sent an expedition against the Kufichis or Qufs, the Baluchi mountaineers whose banditry had long made the southern and eastern parts of the province insecure; the Saljuq invasion of Kirman seems to have given a general stimulus to the eastward migration of the Baluchis into Makran and the modern Baluchistan.2 Qavurt was even strong enough to mount an expedition across the Persian Gulf and seize the former Buyid dependency of Oman from the local Khawarij; it was to remain under Saljuq suzer ainty until c. 5 36/1140.3 When his father Chaghri died, Qavurt recognized the succession of Alp-Arslan in the east, and after Toghril died and Alp-Arslan came to Kirman in 456/1064, Qavurt recognized him as supreme Saljuq sultan and gave him his allegiance. This he withdrew three years later, removing his brother's name from the khutba.4 Alp-Arslan then came with an army and restored the status quo, granting Qavurt full for giveness; yet the latter was never fully reconciled to the exaltation of another man over the whole of the Saljuq family, and when MalikShah took over his father's throne, Qavurt rebelled against the new sultan (see below, pp. 88-9). After the siege of Jiruft in Kirman in 459/1067, Alp-Arslan's army marched into Fars, which five years previously had been conquered by Qavurt from the Shabankara'i

chieftain Fadluya, though it had afterwards slipped from Saljuq control. In the course of this campaign in Fars several fortresses were taken: indeed, the conquest of Istakhr is said to have given a great fillip to Nizam al-Mulk's fame. A further campaign against Fadluya was required in 461/1069, but this particular menace was now removed by the capture and killing of Fadluya and of his brother Hasan or Hasanuya.1 It has been noted that Alp-Arslan never visited Baghdad personally.2 He was nevertheless concerned to maintain his rights in Iraq, and above all to watch over the Arab amirs there and ensure that they did nothing more to encourage the Fatimids' ambitions in Iraq. The sultan's military representative in the Iraq was shahna, a position normally given to one of his ghulam commanders. A s far as possible, the sultan always appointed a man who was persona grata to the 'Abbasid caliph. Al-Qa'im objected to Ai-Tegin, appointed in 464/1071, because his son had killed one of the caliph's ghulams; so Alp-Arslan and Nizam al-Mulk agreed to remove him and substitute Gauhar-A'in, a former ghulam of the Buyid Abu Kalijar.3 As was customary, administrative and diplomatic contact between the sultanate and caliphate was channelled through the respective viziers. When in 450/1058 Ibn alMuslima was killed, his successor as vizier to al-Qa'im was the capable and energetic Fakhr al-Daula Muhammad b. Jahir, who had formerly served the 'Uqailids, Mirdasids, and most recently the Marwanid Nasr al-Daula.4 Over the next fifteen years Ibn Jahir strove to maintain the influence of the caliphate in Iraq. By a skilful cultivation of the Arab amirs, most of whom were Shi'is, he won their allegiance to the 'Abbasids. Nizam al-Mulk was on friendly terms with his opposite number, and in 462/1069-70 his daughter Safiyya was married to Ibn Jahir's son 'Amid al-Daula. A t the same time he received from the caliph the honorificsQiwam al-Din ("Support of Religion") and Kadi Amir al-Muyminin ("Favoured One of the Commander of the Faith ful"). Indeed, in 460/1068 al-Qa'im had temporarily dismissed Ibn Jahir for his subservience to the Saljuqs, "because", in the words of Ibn al-Jauzi, " you have put on robes of honour from 'Adud al-Daula

[i.e. from Alp-Arslan]".1 The sultan used caliphal support in 458/1066 to make his son Malik-Shah vail 'ahd; at a ceremony near Marv, the assembled amirs took an oath of allegiance to Malik-Shah and his name was placed in the khutba. A t the same time, Alp-Arslan publicly allotted the governorships of Khwarazm, Khurasan, the upper Oxus lands, and the Caspian provinces, to several of his brothers, sons, and other relatives. The seal was set on cordial relations with the caliph when in 464/1071-2 Alp-Arslan's daughter was married to al-Qa'im's son and heir, who was later to become Caliph al-Muqtadi.2 Saljuq policy in Iraq and the Syrian desert fringes was to maintain the existing power of the Arab amirs while keeping them under close surveillance. Thus it was from the sultan in the first place that the 'Uqailid Sharaf al-Daula Muslim b. Quraish of Mosul (d. 478/1085) sought the grant of Anbar, Hit, and other places in central 'Iraq, and only afterwards did he get caliphal confirmation. In Basra, the sultan in 459/1067 restored to the governorship and to the tax-farm there the Kurd Taj al-Muluk Hazarasp b. Bankir, and he linked his fortunes to those of the Saljuqs by giving Hazarasp one of his own sisters in marriage. After Hazarasp's death three years later, this same sister was again given in a political marriage, this time to the 'Uqailid Sharaf al-Daula Muslim.3 Thanks to this policy, Iraq enjoyed a period of tranquillity after the violence of Toghril's reign. The Fatimids did not dare to interfere there, and their influence also diminished in some parts of the Arabian peninsula. In 462/1070 the sharif of Mecca, Muhammad b. Abi Hashim, came to Alp-Arslan with the news that the khutba in Mecca was now being made for the 'Abbasid caliph and the Saljuq sultan, and no longer for the Fatimid al-Mustansir; and further, the Shi'i adhan (call to prayer) had been abolished. The sultan attempted to make this volte-face permanent by allotting the sharif a generous pension.4 It was his activities in the west, and above all his victory at Malazgird (Mantzikert), which established Alp-Arslan in the eyes of posterity as a Muslim hero. In some respects this victory was a fortuitous one, for a crusade against the Christians does not appear to have been one of the mainsprings of the sultan's policy. Wittek and Cahen have shown that in dealing with the overrunning of Anatolia at this time,

we must distinguish clearly between the official policy of the Saljuq sultans and the uncontrolled activities of Turkmen raiders. The moderate, even magnanimous, attitude adopted by Alp-Arslan towards the defeated Byzantine Emperor Romanus Diogenes shows that his most basic policy at this time was essentially one of co-existence between the two great empires, Christian and Islamic. Just as the Oghuz bands when they first entered Khurasan had been unable to conceive that the formidable Ghaznavid empire might crack under their puny attacks, so the Byzantine empire, which had withstood many Muslim attacks in the past, was regarded by the Saljuqs as ageless and invincible. The Turkmen, on the other hand, sought plunder and pasture for their herds wherever they could find them. They too had no thoughts of overthrowing Byzantine rule in Anatolia, for they were militarily incapable of besieging and taking the Byzantine strongholds there; but their spreading out through the Anatolian countryside inevitably led to the surrender of the Greek cities, which were now encircled and cut off from their rural hinterland. In effect, the Turkmen on the Byzantine and Armenian frontiers in eastern Anatolia swelled the ranks of older Muslim ghazi elements, Arab, Kurdish, and Dailamiwarriors who had long faced their Byzantine counterparts, the akritai. With this increase of Turks on the frontiers, the Turkish terms aqinj'i (raider) and uj (properly extremity, border > fighter on the border) come into use side by side with that of ghazi.1 Shortly after his accession, Alp-Arslan, accompanied by his son MalikShah and by Nizam al-Mulk, campaigned in Armenia, capturing Ani from its Byzantine garrison. Gagik-Abas of Kars submitted and the sultan penetrated into Georgia, where he consolidated his influence by marrying a niece of the Georgian King Bagrat IV, but in 460/1068 a further campaign against Georgia was necessary.2 In 459/1067 AlpArslan was in Arran, where he received the tribute of the Shaddadid Fadl II b. Shavur and also of the Shirvan-Shah Fakhr al-Din Fariburz b. Sallar; in the ensuing years Turkish ghulam governors were ap pointed for the western shores of the Caspian as far north as Darband.3

ALP-ARSLAN'S REIGN

Meanwhile, virtually independent Turkmen bands were already raiding far into Anatolia: in 459/1067 Caesarea (Kayseri) in Cappadocia was sacked; in the next year Amorium in Phrygia, and in the next year Iconium (Konya). Despite all this, the Byzantines still occasionally followed their traditional practice of employing predatory bands such as these Turkmen as auxiliaries (foederati) against other Turkmen. The attacks on central Anatolia menaced the Byzantine lines of communication that stretched through %he Taurus and Cilicia to their cities of Antioch, Edessa, and Malatya in northern Syria and Diyarbakr. The Emperor Romanus accordingly sent an army to northern Syria, which secured the defence of these cities and then took the offen sive against the Muslims: Artah, between Antioch and Aleppo, and Manbij on the Euphrates were both captured, and Aleppo itself was menaced. It is likely that a truce was made in 462/1070 between AlpArslan and Romanus, since the sultan now felt free to turn his attention to what had long been a favoured project of his: the expulsion of the Fatimids from Syria and even perhaps a march on Egypt. According to two writers, the historian of Aleppo, Ibn al-'Adlm, and the Egyptian Ibn Muyassar, an appeal was made to Alp-Arslan at this time by a certain rebel against the Fatimids in Egypt. Yet whatever type of truce may have been made, no real cessation of hostilities in Anatolia was possible, for the sultan had very little control over the activity of the Turkmen there.1 In the spring of 463/1071 Alp-Arslan was in northern Syria when he heard the news that Romanus had assembled a vast army at Erzerum and had marched eastwards into Armenia. The sultan was taken by surprise and treated this as a breach of the truce. With wild exaggera tion, Muslim and Christian sources variously number the emperor's army at between 200,000 and one million; more reliable sources say that it included Frankish, Russian, Khazar, Pecheneg, Oghuz, and Qipchaq mercenaries, as well as Greeks and Armenians. The pitched battle which took place at Malazgird was the first major one that the Turks had ever ventured against a Byzantine army. It ended in disaster for the Greeks, the supreme indignity being the capture of the Basileus by the Muslims. But even in his hour of victory Alp-Arslan did not endeavour to destroy the Byzantine empire. Romanus was allowed to ransom himself, promising tribute and a

marriage alliance, and it is possible that he promised to cede such cities as Malazgird, Edessa, Antioch, and Manbij; as it was, the deposition and death of Romanus rendered all these provisions void.1 The defeat at Malazgird was a symptom rather than a cause of the Greeks' downfall in eastern Anatolia. In the years just before this, the will to resist among the Byzantine akritai had been weakening, espe cially as many of these warriors were Armenians, resentful of Byzantine political and ecclesiastical policy in their country; moreover the poor quality of Romanus's army, huge though it may have been in numbers, was reflected in what was at least a trickle of desertions to the enemy. From 464/1072 onwards, eastern and central Anatolia lay open to the Turkmen, who speedily overran all the region except for the strong holds in the Taurus. Alp-Arslan's victory at Malazgird also meant that, apart from the districts of Tashir and eastern Siunikc, Armenia passed definitely into Muslim hands; and within the next decade or so, the Byzantines, resolutely anti-Armenian to the end, exterminated several survivors of the native Bagratid and Ardzrunid dynasties.2 Thus in succeeding centuries only the tiny kingdom of Georgia survived as an independent Christian power in the Caucasus. Alp-Arslan took steps early in his reign to secure his eastern fron tiers, where there were old rivals such as the Qarakhanids and Ghaznavids whose attitude might flare up into hostility should a favourable opportunity present itself. The western Qarakhanid khanate of Soghdia and Farghana was at this time under the rule of Tamghach-Khan Ibrahim b. Nasr (c. 444-60/^. 1052-68). The historical sources and the "Mirrors for Princes" both portray this khan as a man of outstanding justice and piety: he cultivated the 'ulama, was careful not to introduce uncanonical taxation, and protected the common people against banditry and exploitation by commercial interests.3 Already in Toghril's lifetime Alp-Arslan had demonstrated by a show of force against the Qarakhanids that his father's old influence along the Oxus valley was to be upheld; now that Alp-Arslan was supreme sultan, he invaded the territories of Tamghach-Khan Ibrahim, causing the latter to protest to the caliph about this unprovoked aggression. Over the following years, however, Alp-Arslan adopted a more pacific policy here and

ALP-ARSLAN'S REIGN
endeavoured to secure harmony with the Qarakhanids through a series of marriage alliances. He himself married the widowed daughter of Qadir Khan Yusuf, formerly ruler of Kashghar and Khotan; his daughter 'A'isha was given to Ibrahim's son and successor, Shams alMulk Nasr; and his son Malik-Shah married another Qarakhanid princess, who eventually gave birth to the future Saljuq Sultan Mahmud (see below, p. 103).1 The links between the two Turkish houses were therefore ostensibly close, though they did not prevent tension from arising at the end of Alp-Arslan's reign between the sultan and Shams al-Mulk Nasr (460-72/ 1068-80). In 465/1072 Alp-Arslan crossed the Oxus on a bridge of boats with an army alleged to number 200,000, but this campaign was cut short by his death: he was stabbed by a local castellan whom he had condemned to death. Shams al-Mulk thereupon took the offensive and carried the war over to the Saljuq side of the Oxus. He captured Tirmidh and ejected Ayaz b. Alp-Arslan from Balkh before the new sultan Malik-Shah could intervene and cause the Qarakhanid forces to retreat.2 Throughout this period relations with the Ghaznavids were harmonious, and the frontier agreed upon by Chaghri Beg and Sultan Ibrahim b. Mas'ud remained respected.3 Apart from dealings with these two great powers, Alp-Arslan had had to contend with a certain amount of unrest and rebelliousness on the eastern fringes of the empire, where some local rulers and governors tried to take advantage of the troubled circumstances surrounding the sultan's accession. In 456/1064 he had to subdue and finally kill the rebellious amir of Khuttal and the governor of Chaghaniyan (whether these were the descendants of former local rulers or merely nominees of the Saljuqs is unknown), while a revolt of his uncle Fakhr al-Mulk Musa Yabghu in Herat also had to be suppressed.4 In the following year the sultan undertook an expedition from Marv to Khwarazm and then into the Ust Urt and Qipchaq steppes, the ancestral home of the Oghuz; and at this time he did in fact take the opportunity of visiting Jand, where Saljuq b. Duqaq was buried. These events are

treated in some detail by Mirkhwand, but both the events and the personages involved remain somewhat shadowy and mysterious. It appears that Alp-Arslan was formally recognized in Khwarazm as sultan and that he then left as governor there his son or brother ArslanArghun;1 from Khwarazm he led a punitive campaign against the Qipchaq, penetrating as far as the Manqishlaq peninsula on the eastern Caspian shore.2 We have seen that when Malik-Shah was made heir to the throne in 458/1066, Alp-Arslan chose the occasion to redistribute governorships in the east among members of the Saljuq family. According to Ibn al-Athir, Tabaristan was given to Inanch Yabghu (? Bighu), Balkh went to the sultan's brother Sulaiman, Khwarazm to his brother Arslan-Arghun, and Chaghaniyan and Tukharistan to his brother Ilyas; Marv was given to his youngest son Arslan-Shah, the district of Baghshur (near Marv ar-Rud) to Mas'ud b. Er-Tash, and Isfizar to Maudud b. Er-Tash.3 That he continued to grant the eastern fringes as appanages for lesser members of the family, despite the opportunities this gave for rebelliousness, seems to show that the sultan was still mindful of traditional obligations to family members; it further seems to imply that he now considered western Iran and Iraq to be the Saljuq empire's centre of gravity and the regions most demanding of his personal presence.

Jalal al-Daula Mu'izz al-Din Abu'l-Fath Malik-Shah (465-85/1072-92) continued and in some ways surpassed the triumphs of his father. The lands of the Great Saljuqs were never more extensive than during Malik-Shah's reign. In the east there was something like a state of equilibrium with the Ghaznavid Sultan Ibrahim, although the pre tensions of the Qarakhanids in Tukharistan and in the other lands to the south of the Oxus—pretensions which had already caused anxiety to Alp-Arslan—made the north-eastern frontier a certain source of worry in the early part of Malik-Shah's reign. When internal dissension

within the Qarakhanid dominions afforded a chance for intervention, the sultan undertook an important campaign into Transoxiana and beyond, carrying Saljuq arms into places where they had never been seen before, such as Talas and Kashghar. In the north-west, Saljuq troops operated amongst the Muslim amirs of Mughan, Arran, and Shirvan, and also amongst the Christian peoples of the southern Caucasus. In Anatolia, following Malazgird and the Muslim conquest of Armenia, Qutlumush's two sons Sulaiman and Mansur took advantage of the collapse of the Byzantine limes (frontier defence line) to raid as far as the shores of the Aegean. The generally hostile attitude of these two Saljuq princes towards Malik-Shah, the son of their father's rival and vanquisher, makes it questionable whether the Turkmen conquests in Anatolia were in any measure attachable to or dependent upon the Great Saljuq empire. In the Arab lands south of Anatolia, however, the sultan's direct influence was extended by several means: through the agency of such slave commanders as Aq-Sonqur, Bursuq, and Khumar-Tegin; by Turkmen begs, e.g. Artuq and Atsiz b. Uvak; by members of the Saljuq royal family, such as Tutush b. Alp-Arslan; and also by the two Ibn Jahirs, father and son, who were Arab soldier-officials. These latter extinguished the independence of the Marwanids, whose attitude in the Saljuq-Fatimid conflict had been at times ambiguous; in addition they reduced the power of other Arab amirates such as the 'Uqailids, they mopped up survivals of Greco-Armenian resistance in northern Syria, expelled the lieutenants of the Fatimids from the whole of Syria and the greater part of Palestine, and they even undertook successful expeditions into the Arabian peninsula as far as the Yemen in the southwest and al-Ahsa' in the east. Such an achievement is an impressive one for a comparatively young man—Malik-Shah was only thirty-seven when he died—and it contrasts with the disunity and the squabbling amongst the sultan's children after his death in 485/1092. Thereafter, Saljuq power in Iraq and west ern Iran was to become increasingly enfeebled. Khurasan and the east were under the rule of Sanjar, the most capable of Malik-Shah's sons and the one favoured by a long life, and this region enjoyed the greatest degree of stability and continuity of rule in the first half of the 6th/12th century; yet even here, Sanjar's dominion was to end in tragedy and confusion at the hands of intransigent Turkmen tribesmen.

68
Malik-Shah's achievement was by no means a wholly personal one; indeed, the contribution of Vizier Nizam al-Mulk was even greater than that of his master. Whereas in the years before 465/1072 Nizam al-Mulk had served men of maturity and experience, such as Chaghri Beg and Alp-Arslan, now his sultan was a young man of eighteen whom he hoped to control and adapt to his own ideal of a despotic monarch in the Iranian-Islamic tradition. His entire period as vizier to the Saljuq sultans extended over thirty years, not counting his service to the prince Alp-Arslan when Toghril was still sultan.1 His famous boast to Malik-Shah, made just before his assassination in 485/1092 and when his enemies at court were concerting their plans against him, was tactless but substantially true:
Tell the Sultan, " If you have not already realized that I am your co-equal in the work of ruling, then know that you have only attained to this power through my statesmanship and judgement." Does he not remember when his father was killed, and I assumed responsibility for the conduct of affairs and crushed the rebels who reared their heads, from his own family and from elsewhere, such as so-and-so and so-and-so (and he named a whole group of those who had risen up in revolt) ? . . . Tell him that the stability of that regal cap is bound up with this vizierial inkstand, and that the harmony of these two interests is the means of securing all objects sought after and the ultimate cause of all objects gained. If ever I close up this ink stand, that royal power will topple.2
Nizam al-Mulk acted in effect as the atabeg, or tutor, of Malik-Shah. This Turkish title, meaning literally "Father-commander", was not in wide use till after Malik-Shah's death, when there were several young Saljuq princes who were provided with atabegs (see below, pp. 111-12); but Nizam al-Mulk himself received the title amongst the epithets bestowed on him at the beginning of Malik-Shah's reign, and he was usually addressed by the sultan as "Father".3 Nizam al-Mulk directed policy primarily through the Great Divan or administrative office (Divan-i Va^ir} Dlvdn-i Sultan), the executive centre of the state, over which he presided. He had considerable influence within the sultan's standing army and an important voice in the nomination of amirs for specific campaigns. On occasion he

would still undertake expeditions himself, but increasing age and the feeling of power which he already derived from being at the centre of things in his divan, led him during Malik-Shah's reign to prefer the role of organizer and diplomat to that of field commander. Either in this divan, which was normally located in the sultan's capital of Isfahan, or else while he was accompanying the monarch on his campaigns and missions, Nizam al-Mulk supervised the operation of the subordinate departments: those of the Mustaufi (Chief Accountant), of the Munshi* or Tughra'I (Chief Secretary), of the ''Arid al-Jaish (Chief of Military Affairs and Organization), and of the Mushrif (Chief of Intelligence and Investigation Services). This central bureaucracy, whose five-part division obviously follows that of the Ghaznavids, he succeeded in moulding largely to his own liking. He filled it with officials who were either from his own family or were his proteges and supporters; in many cases the two categories became coterminous through the marriages which he arranged. In the early part of Malik-Shah's reign two men are specially mentioned in the sources as having aided Nizam al-Mulk in making the bureaucracy a pliant instrument for the execu tion of his policy: the Sahib Dwdn al-Inshd9 wa'/-Tughrd (" Ht&d of the Department of Correspondence and the Seal"), one Kamal al-Daula A b u Rida Fadlallah; and the Sahib al-Zimdm wa?l-lstija (" Head of the Department of Financial Control and Accounting"), a man named Sharaf al-Mulk Abu Sa'd Muhammad.1 Nizam al-Mulk's own children were a numerous and ambitious clan; Ravandi numbers his sons at twelve, all of whom, so he says, held some office or other.2 Certainly we find several of them entrenched in lucrative posts throughout the empire, not only in the central bureau cracy but also in the strategically important provincial governorships, where the vizier required trusty supporters to put his decrees into practice. Shams al-Mulk 'Uthman was governor of Marv. Jamal alMulk Mansur was governor of Balkh till his murder in 475/1082; in Alp-Arslan's times his pride had made him reject his father's request that he should act as vizier to the prince Malik-Shah. " It is not fitting", he said," for someone like me to act as vizier to a mere boy. " 3 Mu'ayyid al-Mulk 'Ubaidallah's power and influence were almost as great as

those of his father. A t one point Nizam al-Mulk hoped to impose him on the 'Abbasid caliph as his vizier, but al-Muqtadi strenuously objected; eventually Mu'ayyid al-Mulk replaced Karnal al-Daula as Tughrá'i in the Saljuq administration. In 475/1082-3 Mu'ayyid al-Mulk entered Baghdad from Isfahan and assumed the privilege, normally bestowed only by express royal command on the greatest men in the state, of having a salute of drums and military music (nauba) playing outside his house at three of the daily prayer times; a handsome pay ment persuaded him to desist from this. Likewise, when Nizam alMulk's daughter died in 470/1077-8, her father secured for her body the privilege of burial in the grounds of the caliphal palace at Baghdad.1 It was not surprising that the vizier's opponents accused him and his family of arrogance and of the abuse of political and social power. In addition to his own family, Nizam al-Mulk had a numerous following of secretaries and officials who were seeking his patronage, together with a personal household of ghuláms w h o were said to number several thousand.2 According to Anushírván b. Khálid, parents hastened to send their children to the great vizier's household for their education.3 For his part, Nizám al-Mulk was always careful to attract useful, capable men into his service and into the administra tion, and the power of this retinue is shown by their activities after Nizam al-Mulk's death. Within a short time his ghuláms had wreaked vengeance on his old rival Táj al-Mulk Abu'1-Ghaná'im, who was widely suspected of having instigated Nizám al-Mulk's murder. More important, his descendants played a prominent part in public affairs for at least half a century after his death, many of them acting as viziers and officials for the Saljuq sultans and for the caliphs, despite the fact that only one or two of these officials seem to have had outstanding ability. Nizám al-Mulk also tried to buttress the structure of the Saljuq empire, and to counter the splendour and prestige of the Fatimid caliphate in Cairo, by encouraging the progress of the Sunni revival in Iraq and Iran. The sources attribute to him a decisive role as the protagonist of Sunni orthodoxy, saying that he restored political and social order in Iran by repairing the damage to state and religion wrought by the heretical and tyrannical Büyids. Later in Malik-Shah's

reign, the Ismá'ilís or Assassins appeared in several areas of Iran, disturbing in some measure the course of this return to orthodoxy; since several of the Assassin strongholds were in the Alburz mountains, the region in which the province of Dailam lay, it is not unreasonable to see this outbreak of political and religious heterodoxy as a recru descence of earlier Iranian opposition to the orthodox institutions of the Baghdad caliphate and of Sunni Islam. However, the Isma'ili movement in Iran never constituted a major threat to the estab lished institutions, and it is likely that Ismá'Ilism's conspiratorial methods, in particular its weapon of political assassination, caused contemporaries to exaggerate its importance. [For a detailed treatment of Ismá'ilism in Iran, see below, pp. 422-82.] It seems that Nizam al-Mulk desired to speed up the provision of educational institutions within the eastern Sunni world and to make them comparable with those still flourishing in Umayyad Spain and Fátimid Egypt. There is some controversy about his exact motives in founding these madrasas, or colleges of higher learning, which were named Nigamiyyas in his honour. Did he seek to create a network of these institutions personally dependent on himself, meaning to further his own political plans; or was his aim the more general one of raising intellectual standards throughout eastern, non-Fátimid Islam, with the madrasas fitting into a pattern of state-supported education?1 The latter view is probably the more likely one in the context of contem porary events. The Sunni madrasa-building movement had begun in the second half of the 4th/ioth century and was in full swing well before Nizam al-Mulk's time. It was a response first to the challenge of Mu'tazill thought, and subsequently to the Fátimid institutions for training Shi'i da'zs or propagandists: i.e. the Azhar mosque of the Fátimid general Jauhar and the Caliph al-Mu'izz (founded in 359/970), the Dar al-Hikma (" House of Learning") of the Caliph al-Hakim (founded in 395/1005), and the various local dar al-da'was, or rallying-places and centres for propaganda. T o implement Nizám al-Mulk's administrative policies throughout the Saljuq empire required the training of reliable personnel as secretaries and officials, and herein probably lies the key
1 For these two views, see the articles of G. Makdisi, "Muslim Institutions of Learning in Eleventh-century Baghdad", B.S.O.A.S. pp. 1-56, and A. L. Tibawi, "Origin and Character of al-Madrasab"', B.S.O.A.S. pp. 225-38. Tibawi's standpoint is nearer to that of the earlier, classic writers on the subject: see Goldziher, "Education—Muslim", Encyc. of Religion and Ethics; and Pedersen, "Masdjid", Encyc. of Islam (1st ed.). On the madrasa under the Saljuqs see also below, pp. 214-17 and 289-90.

to his motives. Moreover, not only was madrasa education free, as of course it was in other educational institutions, but generous living allowances were allotted to students at the Nizamiyyas.1 Taj al-Dln al-Subki, the 8th/14th century compiler of a biographical dictionary of Shafi'i scholars, attributes to Nizam al-Mulk the founda tion of a madrasa in every important city of Iraq and Iran, and he specifically mentions nine of them: the ones at Baghdad and Nishapur (the two most famous Nizamiyyas), and those at Balkh, Herat, Marv, Amul in Gurgan, Isfahan, Basra, and Mosul.2 This prominence of Khurasanian cities may not be fortuitous. During the 5th/nth century Sunni scholarship in Khurasan was at its most brilliant. It had behind it a long tradition of political and cultural orthodoxy, stretching back through the Ghaznavids and Samanids to the Tahirids, whereas central and western Iran were for a long time in the Saljuq period still politically and religiously suspect because of their association with heterodox Dailami dynasties. Nizam al-Mulk regarded the appoint ment of suitable scholars to teach at his Nizamiyyas as a personal responsibility. When the Baghdad Nizamiyya opened in 459/1067, he took considerable pains to secure for it the scholar Abu Ishaq alShirazi, and later, in 484/1091, he brought the theologian and philo sopher Abu Hamid al-Ghazali to lecture there when the latter was only thirty-three and little known outside his native Khurasan. On Malik-Shah's first visit to Baghdad in 479-80/1081, after the conclusion of the campaign in northern Syria, Nizam al-Mulk personally lectured on hadith_ or tradition at his madrasa and dictated to the students there.3
The use of scholars from Khurasan is bound up with another controversial aspect of Nizam al-Mulk's educational policy: the degree to which he specifically hoped to further his own Shafi'I law school and the Ash'ari kalam. Many of the sources may have over emphasized the Shafi'I and Ash'ari nature of the teaching at the Nizamiyyas. Before the great vizier achieved such power in the Saljuq state, these doctrines were very suspect to men such as Toghril and
1 Subki, Tabaqdt al-shaft''iyya al-kubrdy vol. m, p. 137, rightly refutes the assertion made in many sources, that the great vizier was the first person to build madrasas; but, says Subki, he may have been the first to assign allowances to the students. However, even this is dubious. 2 See his article on Nizam al-Mulk, op. cit. vol. 111, pp. 135-45. 3 Ibn al-Jauzi, al-Muntagam, vol. ix, pp. 36, 55; Ibn al-Athir, al-Kdmil, vol. x, p. 104; Subki, vol. iv, pp. 103-4; cf.

his minister Kunduri;1 and Nizam al-Mulk's support for the doctrines did not guarantee their acceptance and recognition, especially outside Khurasan. In Baghdad and the western provinces they were anathema to conservative religious circles, Hanafi as well as Hanbali, who regarded them as alien, Khurasanian imports. If the Nizamiyyas were institutions for the propagation of Shafi'ism and Ash'arism, they failed in Iraq and western Iran. Although the 'Abbasid caliphs were Shafi'Is, the Saljuq sultans themselves remained staunch Hanafis, and the fervent Hanafi Ravandi, who wrote his history of the Saljuqs in the opening years of the 13 th century, still couples together for denunciation the Rafidis (i.e. the extremist Shfis and Isma'ilis) and the Ash'aris. 'Imad al-Din stresses the violent Hanafi partisanship shown by several of Sultan Mas'ud b. Muhammad's ghulam amirs. Between the years 536/1141-2 and 542/1147-8 he speaks of the persecution and expulsion of Shafi'i scholars by Saljuq governors and commanders in Baghdad, Ray, and Isfahan, where some Shafi'is found it politic to change to Hanafism.2 In Baghdad the Nizamiyya declined in the 6th/12th century, and it was the Hanbali colleges which were intel lectually the most vital in Baghdad at this time. But perhaps the most significant piece of evidence which we have against any undue partisan ship by Nizam al-Mulk is his soothing pronouncement, as reported by the fiercely Hanbali Ibn al-Jauzi, when the Hanbalis of Baghdad were protesting against the public teaching of Ash'arism:
The Sultan's policy and the dictates of justice require us not to incline to any one rite \madhhab\ to the exclusion of others; w e aim at strengthening orthodox belief and practice [al-sunan\ rather than at fanning sectarian strife. W e have built this madrasa [i.e. the Nizamiyya] only for the protection of scholars and in the public interest, and not to cause controversy and dis sension.3
Nizam al-Mulk was not by any means the sole person to busy himself with founding madrasas. Makdisi has drawn up an impressive list of the Hanafi, Shafi'i, and Hanbali colleges which were flourishing in Baghdad at this time, and he has pointed out that the madrasa built around the shrine of the Imam Abu Hanifa (this was built in 457-9/ 1065-7 under the authority of Alp-Arslan's mustaufi, Sharaf al-Mulk Abu Sacd Muhammad) was doubtless of equal importance to the

Nizamiyya, though less publicized in the sources.1 Nizam al-Mulk's example stimulated other leading figures to found educational institu tions; in 480-2/1087-9 his own great enemy, the mustaufi Taj al-Mulk Abu'l-Ghana'im, founded a Shafi'I madrasa in Baghdad, the Ta/'iyja, where Abu Bakr al-Shashi and Abu Hamid's brother Abu'l-Futuh alGhazali both taught.2 Despite his commanding position in the Saljuq state, Nizam al-Mulk's authority did not go unchallenged. His arrogant trust in his own powers and indispensability did not endear him to other courtiers or even to the sultan himself, once he had outgrown his initial dependence on the vizier. Nor was Nizam al-Mulk without enemies within the Saljuq administra tion itself, in large measure because of his partisanship and his way of pushing his own relatives and proteges. The officials of the bureau cracy had entered their profession in the expectation of a reasonable rotation of offices in which persons of merit would have a fair chance of obtaining the most coveted and lucrative posts, such as the director ship of the central Divans and of the provincial administrative organs. Nizam al-Mulk's long tenure of office, together with his control of so much of the stream of patronage, upset these expectations; at the best of times not everyone could be satisfied, but Nizam al-Mulk now stood as a tangible target for frustrated and ambitious rivals. O n the whole, his firm policy and his emphasis on military preparedness made him popular in the army, but it was natural that those commanders close to the sultan or personally attached to him should come to share MalikShah's restiveness. For the first seven years of the sultan's reign, the authority of Nizam al-Mulk had gone unchallenged; then in 472/1079-80 two of MalikShah's slave generals precipitated a major crisis by their act of defiance of the vizier's power. The shahna of Baghdad, Sa'd al-Daula GauharA'in, and the governor of Fars and Khuzistan, Najm al-Daula KhumarTegin al-Sharabi, were Nizam al-Mulk's deadly enemies, and together killed one of his proteges, Ibn 'Allan, the Jewish tax-farmer of Basra, and despoiled him of his wealth. The sultan sought the vizier's pardon but no retribution was exacted, which showed that the latter's partisans were not personally above the law.3 In the next year Malik-Shah insisted, against Nizam al-Mulk's advice, on dismissing from the army

7,000 Armenian mercenaries (see below, p. 81). In an effort to counter the vizier's influence, he began to encourage the latter's opponents in the administration, and two rival parties now emerged. The central figure in the opposition was Taj al-Mulk Abu'l-Ghana'im Marzban b. Khusrau Firuz, who came from a vizierial family in Fars. Through the patronage of the slave general Sav-Tegin he had risen in royal favour, becoming successively vizier to the sultan's male children (known as maliks), then treasurer, overseer of the palace buildings, and finally head of the Dwan al-Insha* wcfl-'tughrd. A t his side were other high officials: first the son of Kamal al-Daula A b u Rida, the Sayyid al-Ru'asa' Abu'l-Mahasin Muhammad, hostile to Nizam al-Mulk even though he was the vizier's son-in-law;1 next, 'Amid al-Daula Ibn Bahmanyar, vizier to the governor of Fars, Khumar-Tegin; and finally the 'Arid Sadid al-Mulk Abu'l-Ma'ali al-Mufaddal, one of Taj al-Mulk's proteges. Ibn Bahmanyar tried in 473/1080-1 to procure the poisoning of Nizam al-Mulk, but he failed and was blinded by the vizier.2 Another manifestation of the feeling against Nizam al-Mulk was the circula tion at court of satirical poetry and slanderous stories aimed at him and his sons. One of Malik-Shah's court jesters, Ja'farak, had been active in this work, and in retaliation Jamal al-Mulk al-Mansur b. Nizam al-Mulk, governor of Balkh, came in a rage to Isfahan in 475/ 1082-3 a n d t o r e o u t jester's tongue, killing him in the process. Malik-Shah made no open protest, but he had the civil governor of Khurasan, Abu 'AH, secretly poison Jamal al-Mulk at Nishapur; he then hypocritically commiserated with Nizam al-Mulk.3 Where Ibn Bahmanyar had failed to secure the vizier's downfall, the Sayyid al-Ru'asa' Abu'l-Mahasin, one of the sultan's intimates, now tried, accusing Nizam al-Mulk of amassing wealth and offices for his family. The vizier did not deny this, but retorted that these were the just rewards for his service to three generations of Saljuq rulers; that the thousands of Turkish ghulams in his service added to the sultan's military potential; and that much of his wealth was expended on pious and charitable works which redounded equally to the sultan's glory. Malik-Shah did not feel able to withstand the power of Nizam alMulk's ghulams and the general support for him within the Saljuq army.4 He let Abu'l-Mahasin be blinded and imprisoned, while the

latter's father Kama! al-Daula lost to Nizam al-Mulk's son Mu'ayyid al-Mulk his office of Tughra'I (478/108 3-4).1 In this way Nizam al-Mulk surmounted a prolonged period of crisis: but opposition would again build up towards the end of his life, this time centred round Taj al-Mulk and the sultan's first wife, the Qarakhanid princess Jalaliyya Khatun or Terken Khatun (usually spelt " T u r k a n " in the sources), whom he had married in 456/1064.2 For although Nizam al-Mulk achieved a dominant position in the administration, he never enjoyed equal influence at the court (dargdh). It is for this reason that in his Siydsat-Ndma much is said about how the sovereign should comport himself and how the court institutions and officials should be organized to serve the ideal of a despotic state, but there is little about the procedures of the divans, which the vizier had already largely moulded to his own satisfaction. Further, the vizier did not consider that the Saljuq court was organized with requisite strictness and care for protocol, especially in comparison with the Ghaznavid court; nor was the sultan distant and awe-inspiring enough. Nizam al-Mulk expatiates on such topics as the arrangement of royal drinking sessions, the need to keep an open table and thus main tain traditions of hospitality, and the creation of a proper circle of nadzms, or boon companions, around the ruler. Offices vital for the main tenance of order and discipline at court and within the empire at large have been allowed to lapse, he alleges.3 The fearsome Amzr-i Haras (Captain of the Guard), who maintained discipline through his force of lictors or club-bearers, has lost importance; the Vakzl-i Khdss (intendant of the court and of the sultan's private domains) has declined in status. The court ghulams, who perform many personal services for the sultan—one is the armour-bearer, another the keeper of the wardrobe, another the cup-bearer, etc.—are no longer adequately trained. Worst of all, Alp-Arslan has allowed the Barzd (intelligence net work), which Nizam al-Mulk considers one of the pillars of the despotic state, to decay, on the grounds that it engendered an atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion amongst friend and foe alike.4 Nizam al-Mulk is further apprehensive about the relationship between

the dargah and the divans, and concerned lest the court should interfere in the mechanism of administration. Thus he says the sultan's nadims should never be allowed to hold official posts; letters sent directly from the court to the divans should be as few as possible; only in emergencies should ghulams be used as court messengers, and especial care should be taken with verbal commands from the sovereign, their transmission supervised and their subject matter checked before they are executed.1 Nizam al-Mulk's position vis-a-vis the sultan was thus to some extent unsatisfactory, and his influence at the subordinate households of the sultan's wives and those of the princes (maliks) was still weaker. Terken Khatun's household became the focus of opposition, for Taj al-Mulk was also her personal intendant {vakil). The vizier doubtless had Terken Khatun in mind when in the Siydsat-Ndma he denounced the malevo lent influence of women at court, citing their misleading advice to the ruler and their susceptibility to promptings from their attendants and eunuchs.2 Terken Khatun's son Da'ud had been his father's favourite, but he died in 474/1082. Six years later Malik-Shah had caliphal approval when he proclaimed as heir another of her sons, A b u Shuja' Ahmad, and gave him a resplendent string of honorifics: Malik alMuluk (" King of Kings " ) , ' Adud al-Daula (" Strong Arm of the State "), Taj al-Milla ("Crown of the Religious Community"), and 'Uddat Amir al-Mu*minim ("Protecting Force of the Commander of the Faithful"); but in the following year he too died. After these disap pointments it was not surprising that Terken Khatun wanted to pro mote the succession of her third son Mahmud (b. 480/1087), despite the fact that he was the youngest of all the possible candidates. BerkYaruq, Malik-Shah's son by the Saljuq princess Zubaida Khatun (she was the daughter of Yaquti b. Chaghri Beg), had been born in 474/1081, and there were also two younger sons, Muhammad and Sanjar, born of a slave wife in 474/1082 and 477/1084 respectively.3 Nizam al-Mulk and much of the army supported Berk-Yaruq because he was the eldest and, so far as could be seen, the most capable claimant. There were, however, further collateral members of the Saljuq family who thought that they had a claim to the succession, and on Malik-Shah's death there was to be a period of civil war and confusion before BerkYaruq established his right to the throne.

Despite the ideals of men like Nizam al-Mulk, the constitution of the Saljuq empire remained at this time far from monolithic. Malik-Shah called himself Sultan-i A\am, " Supreme Ruler", but the title of sultan was gradually adopted by other members of the family, in particular by Sulaiman b. Qutlumush in Rum, who was, as we have seen, on cool terms with Malik-Shah and who acted as a virtually independent sovereign. Normally the Saljuq princes below the supreme sultan were known by the titles of malik (ruler) or simply amir (prince, comman der).1 We have to conceive of the Saljuq empire as a series of political groupings rather than as a unitary state. The most extensive and powerful grouping was that surrounding Malik-Shah himself, with his power centred on Isfahan and exercised immediately over central and western Iran, Iraq, and Khurasan. But beyond this his direct influence diminished. On the fringes of Iraq and Syria several Arab amirates were his tributaries and their functions were to repel Fatimid influence in the Syrian desert and to supply troops for the sultan's army. In the mountainous interiors of Fars and Kurdistan, Kurdish tribes such as the Shabankara enjoyed a large degree of autonomy, and their dislike of outside control made them a frequent source of trouble to the sultans. In the frontier areas of Azarbaijan, the Caucasus, Armenia, Anatolia, Khwarazm, and the eastern fringes of Khurasan, Saljuq influence was upheld by the Saljuq princes and governors and also by Turkmen begs.2 T o the Turkmen tribesmen the sultan in Isfahan was a very remote figure, and it was natural that their first allegiance should be given to their own tribal chiefs who were there with them. The begs themselves regarded the sultan more as a supreme tribal khan than as an auto cratic sovereign. For the three generations down to Berk-Yaruq the sultanate had descended from father to son, but in the eyes of Turkmen leaders and even of many members of the Saljuq family, this fact did not establish a precedent. A t times of stress and crisis, tribal beliefs about succession—e.g. the idea of a division of the family patrimony, and the traditional supremacy of the eldest capable male in the princely family—came to the surface. O n Malik-Shah's death, Berk-Yaruq had to contend not only with the claims of his half-brother Mahmud, but also with the pretensions of his maternal uncle Isma'Il b. Yaquti and of his paternal uncles Tutush and Arslan-Arghun.

THE ZENITH OF THE GREAT SALJUQ EMPIRE
79
Many old Turkish traditions and practices were still of significance during Malik-Shah's reign, although this is frequently obscured by the exclusively Arabic and Iranian nature of the historical sources. For example, on his death-bed Alp-Arslan had recommended that his brother Qavurt should marry his widow, according to the Turkish levirate; the purpose of this custom was to keep wealth within the family (and perhaps, in this case, to prevent undue frag mentation of the empire which Alp-Arslan had assembled).1 Again, the early sultans, from Toghril to Malik-Shah, kept up the practice of giving regular feasts (sholen), just like those which tribal leaders held for their retainers. Malik-Shah gave one in his palace each Friday, where, amongst others, scholars and theologians came and held disputations. On the other hand, he neglected to give the customary banquets for the Chigil tribesmen of the Qarakhanid forces at Samarqand and Uzkand whilst on his Transoxianan campaign of 482/1089, and his consequent loss of prestige is chided by the Siydsat-Ndma? Much attention had therefore still to be given to the claims of the Turkmen of the empire, who were established in those regions of Iran suitable for pastoral nomadism, i.e. northern Khurasan, Gurgan and Dihistan; Azarbaijan, Arran, and parts of Kurdistan and Luristan. One would not expect that Nizam al-Mulk, the supreme exponent of the Iranian tradition of order and hierarchy in the state, would have much sympathy with the turbulent and non-assimilable Turkmen. Y e t in the Siydsat-Ndma he recognizes that they have legitimate claims upon the dynasty: in the early days of the Saljuq sultanate, he says, they were its military support, and they are of the same racial stock as the sultans.3 It is likely that as early as MalikShah's reign the fiscal agents of the central administration were trying to extend their operations into the outlying tribal areas. Furthermore, the sultan was now established at Isfahan, not at Nishapur, Marv, or Ray, and therefore he was much occupied with events in 'Iraq and northern Syria. Because he was less accessible to the Turkmen, their just complaints of encroachments on their rights had little chance of being heard at court. This was to be demonstrably true in Sanjar's reign (511-5 2/1118-5 7).

Militarily the sultan no longer depended primarily on the Turkmen bands. Continuity in military and political affairs required a permanent, professional force. The empires of Alp-Arslan and Malik-Shah could not have held together on the deaths of those sovereigns without a loyal core of permanent troops and slaves, directed on the first occasion by Nizam al-Mulk and on the second by his sons and retainers. The constitution of the army now approximated more to the Ghaznavid pattern.1 There was in the standing army a nucleus of either ghulams or slave troops, and the rest were mercenaries. Both groups were drawn from various nationalities, including Turks, Armenians, Greeks, Arabs, and Slavs; Nizam al-Mulk especially commended the employ ment of Dailamis, Khurasanis, Georgians, and Shabankara'i Kurds. This army was normally stationed in the capital, and its commanders were directly under the sultan's orders; according to Ravandi, the number of cavalrymen was not allowed to fall below 46,000.2 The ghulam commanders were extensively used by the sultan for personal service in the palace and for such administrative posts as provincial governorships; and the course of events during MalikShah's reign amply demonstrates that, in contrast to the rebelliousness of certain members of the Saljuq family, the faithfulness of the ghulams towards their master rarely faltered. The sources are not very explicit, but it is probable that the Saljuq maliks in their appanages, as well as the slave generals who were detailed for provincial governorships, also had households of ghulams and permanent forces of their own. The Siyasat-Nama advises the great men of state to expend their wealth on military equipment and the purchase of ghulams rather than on luxury articles for consumption; and we have seen that the vizier himself justified his extensive following of personal ghulams by the plea that the sultan's general striking power was thereby increased (see p. 75 above).3 The maintenance of a standing army was naturally expensive. Reliance on a professional army instead of on tribesmen or local levies has in the course of human history generally meant a rise in state expenditure, resulting in fresh taxation and an increase in the central power of the state. Though Malik-Shah must have welcomed such an accession of power, he was seized at times with desires for economy,

feeling perhaps that the burden was excessive, and that troops could safely be dismissed in the peaceful intervals between campaigns. Against this, Nizam al-Mulk advocated a permanently high level of expenditure on the army, believing this to be the prime buttress of royal power, and he regarded projects for economies as pernicious. At the beginning of Malik-Shâh's reign the vizier had increased the soldiers' allowances by 700,000 dinars in order to secure their loyalty against possible rivals for the succession. In 473/1080-1, however, the sultan reviewed the army at Ray and, in the teeth of the vizier's opposition, discharged from it thousands of Armenian mercenaries. Nizâm al-Mulk expostulated:
There are no secretaries, merchants, tailors, or craftsmen of any kind amongst these persons—the only profession they have is soldiering. If they are discharged, we can never be sure that they will not set up some person from amongst their own number and make him Sultan. We shall have to deal with them, and until we overcome them, we shall expend several times more than we normally allot for their salaries. The sultan would not listen, and the unemployed troops went off to Pushang and joined his brother Tekish, who used them in a rebellion against Malik-Shah.1 Again, towards the end of the reign someone at court, probably from the circle of Tâj al-Mulk and Terken Khatun, suggested to Malik-Shâh that because of the general peace then prevailing, the greater part of the standing army could be dismissed and its numbers thereby cut from 400,000 to 70,000. The vizier denounced this project by saying that it would create 330,000 enemies for the sultan, stop the empire's momentum of expansion, and reduce the kingdom to a state of defencelessness.2 The standing army was supported partly by payments in cash or kind, and partly by revenues from lands or fiefs (iqta's) assigned to the soldiers. In the chapter of the Siyâsat-Nâma, in which Nizâm al-Mulk asserts the necessity of having reserves of cash to pay those soldiers and ghulams who do not have iqtà's ; he also points to the fact that both systems exist side by side.3 Thus it is inaccurate to say that pay

There is a disparity between the vizier's figure for the army and that given by Râvandï, but the higherfiguremay perhaps be a grand total that includes provincial levies, Turkmen, and other troops outside the core of the standing army. 3 Ch. xxiii (Darke tr., pp. 102-3).

ment through fiefs was universal in the Saljuq empire at this time. The central treasury, which held large reserves of cash and treasure, was always sought by claimants to the throne whenever a sultan died; Taj al-Mulk and Terken Khatun secured it in 485/1092 and used it to buy military support for Mahmud's candidature (see below, p. 103).1 The system of iqta's was certainly not invented by Nizam al-Mulk, despite the assertions of such authorities as 'Imad al-Din and alHusaini. The only novelty in the vizier's use of the system appears to be that mentioned by Ravandi, namely, that he allotted to each soldier "grants of taxation" in various provinces of the empire so that wherever a soldier was campaigning, he would have at hand some means of support.2 It has been stressed that the so-called Empire of the Great Saljuqs, far from being a homogeneous, centralized political entity, was really an assemblage of provinces that differed in their geography, their social systems, and historical backgrounds. In the case of the iqta' system, the distinction between the old Buyid lands in the west and the old Ghaznavid ones in the east is significant. Amongst the Buyids and amongst the Hamdanids in al-Jazireh and northern Syria, the main prop of the military regime had been a system of grants of taxation issued to each soldier—theoretically for life only—and collected from the peasants by the fiscal agents of the non-resident grantees (this is the type of fief which the jurist al-Mawardi calls iqta'at al-istighldl^ or assignments of revenue for living-allowances). This system of iqta's was taken over unchanged by the Saljuqs in the western Iranian lands, and it is this one which Nizam al-Mulk discusses in the Siydsat-Ndma. His chief concern here is to guard against abuses by the fief-holders (muqtcfs) and to prevent the land thus granted from slipping out of the state's control. Consequently, he asserts the sultan's ultimate ownership of all land, perhaps in accordance with the Sassanian idea of the ruler's absolute ownership of his kingdom, or perhaps with the aim of extending the ruler's authority over the peasants and thus protecting them from any arbitrariness by the fief-holders. Other safeguards suggested by the vizier are that the peasants should have free access to the court; that the muqtac should collect no more than the sum specified, and only at the appropriate time in the agricultural year; and

THE ZENITH OF THE GREAT SALJUQ EMPIRE
that fiefs should be changed round every three years to avoid the perpetuation of abuses.1 In this system the fief-holders tended to acquire direct rights to exploit the estates granted to them; however, there also existed pure grants of taxed revenue, which carried no rights over the tax-paying land. In 457/1065, in exchange for the fiefs of Qum and Kashan, A l p Arslan granted to the Buyid Abu 'All Fana-Khusrau b. Abi Kalijar 50,000 dinars from the taxes of Basra, together with the right of resid ing there but with no further privileges. Al-Husaini says that when Nizam al-Mulk paid the soldiers' allowances of 1,000 dinars each, half of this was charged to the revenues of Samarqand (from whose Qarakhanid ruler the Saljuqs drew tribute) and half to the revenues of Anatolia, which again was not under the direct control of the sultan. This report may well be exaggerated, probably to emphasize the extent of the Saljuq empire and the careful control which the vizier kept over it; but it does show that money payments could be assigned where there was no question of tenurial rights involved.2 [For more on the iqta's, see chapter 2, pp. 230 ff.] The position was different in Khurasan and in the marches along the Atrak, Murghab, and upper Oxus. As Nizam al-Mulk notes, "former kings", i.e. the Samanids and Ghaznavids, did not generally give land-grants to their soldiers: such factors as the economic richness of Khurasan and the proximity of India as an inexhaustible source of plunder enabled them to pay their troops at stipulated points of the year in cash as well as kind.3 It is true that the concepts of the fief and of commendation by the weak to the strong (talji'a) were known in the east, for the explanation of their technical terminology is given in al-Khuwarizmi's encyclopaedia of the sciences, the Mafdtih al-ulum (written c. 367/977).4 But their occurrence was exceptional. Under the Saljuqs Khurasan remained what it had always been, a border land; now, however, it looked out upon the Saljuqs' rivals, the Qarakhanids and Ghaznavids, and it formed a corridor through which Turkmen from Central Asia passed to the west. Like Azarbaijan in the north-westalso a frontier march, to which similar considerations applied

Khurasan was peopled extensively with Turkmen pastoralists. They could not be fitted into the Buyids' static framework of fiefs, and their interspersion among the sedentary Tajik agricultural population created many problems for the central financial system. Instead of fiefs, the nomads had been granted collective grazing rights since Ghaznavid times, and in the Saljuq period these rights provided the livelihood and maintenance of the Turkmen. Furthermore the Saljuq military organization, despite increasing emphasis on professionalism, still gave these Turkmen a significant role to play. Kafesoglu has shown that outside Iran and Iraq, the majority of new territories added to the Saljuqs' empire or sphere of influence were conquered by Turkmen: men such as Atsiz b. Uvak in Syria, Artuq on the fringes of Arabia, and Sulaiman b. Qutlumush in Anatolia; and the number of Turkmen who could be called upon to swell the Saljuq army was probably 300,000 or more.1 Because of their strategic importance, Khurasan and the upper Oxus lands were usually granted at this time to members of the Saljuq family. A t the beginning of each reign there was a general allocation of these eastern governorships,2 and since administrative continuity and a permanent state of defence were necessary, changes were as far as possible avoided; thus conditions favoured the growth of hereditary lines. In the sources, most of which are non-contemporary, these appanages are often called iqta's; but this is probably an ana chronism, for in the latter half of the 5th/nth century the land system of the east was clearly different from that of the west. The Saljuq principality of Kirman under Qavurt and his descendants was typical of these eastern appanages. Hereditary succession continued here for over a century, not only because the province was somewhat isolated from the rest of Iran, but because it adjoined Sistan and southern Afghanistan where the Saffarids and Ghaznavids had to be watched. Likewise in the west the positions of Tutush in Syria and Sulaiman in Rum were analogous to those of the Saljuq maliks in the east, and once again a frontier situation helps to explain their existence. The sources all praise Malik-Shah and his vizier as the architects of an empire where prosperity reigned and security was established. There is much in this view, for the age of Alp-Arslan and Malik-Shah

was one in which the Great Saljuqs were at last in strong control: rebellious members of the family were firmly handled, a powerful fighting machine enabled the momentum of expansion to be kept up, and the leading talents of the Iranian administrative tradition were taken into the service of the regime. The sources contrast this period, if only implicitly, with the dissension among Malik-Shah's sons and the eventual splitting of the fabric of the empire. O f greater value than the stylized eulogies of Muslim authors is the high praise given to both Alp-Arslan and Malik-Shah by Armenian and Syriac Christian writers. According to the 8th/14th-century historian and geographer Hamd Allah Mustaufi, who is quoting a certain Kisdlat-i Malikshdhi9 the annual revenue of Iran during Malik-Shah's reign amounted to 215 million dinars.1 Despite heavy expenditure on the administration and army, which was only partly alleviated by the practice of granting iqta's, a good proportion of the sultan's income was used to erect tangible memorials to his power—roads, walls, charitable and educa tional institutions, mosques, and palaces. The capital Isfahan benefited especially. There he laid out several palaces and gardens, together with a madrasa, the citadel of the town, and a fortress at nearby Dizküh, where his armoury and treasury were housed; it was in fact this stronghold which fell into the hands of the Isma'ilis during BerkYaruq's reign.2 In the frontier regions and in those provinces where there was a large proportion of Turkmen pastoralists, the provision of town walls was of prime importance. In the exposed province of Khurasan, for example, Malik-Sháh built a wall round Marv that measured 12,300 paces, and he laid out the town of Panj-Dih in the district of Marv ar-Rüd; in 464/1071-2 Nizam al-Mulk raised the height of the walls around Baihaq, which were previously only as high as two men.3 Internal security and the safe movement of travellers and merchants were facilitated by the building of ribdts and caravanserais. In stressing the sultan's piety, the sources describe his zeal in keeping the pilgrimage route from Iraq to the Hijáz in good order; e.g. he provided beacons, wells, and cisterns, and he compensated the amir of the Haramain (or " t w o holy places") with a subsidy, in order that a

tax levied on pilgrims might be abolished: hence from 479/1086 till the sultan's death, the pilgrimage was performed each year without mishap.1 The Saljuq amirs and great men of state were similarly encouraged by the sultan and by Nizam al-Mulk to expend their wealth on good works. A s for Malik-Shah's reputation as a just and equitable ruler, Husain b. Muhammad al-Husaini relates how the sultan sent heralds all round the empire, had boards put up in the towns, and had the khatibs (official preachers) proclaiming from the pulpitsall to announce that he would personally hear and investigate every complaint of injustice.2 We have little direct information on the economic condition of Iran at this time, although the sources frequently mention that by the middle of the reign, in 476/1083-4, there was unparalleled security on the roads and prices were low throughout the empire.3 The measures to improve internal security and communications must have helped economic growth, as must the lightening or abolition of many transit dues and market tolls. Khurasan continued to flourish, once the Turkmen nomads had been assigned a definite place in the agrarian structure of the province, and in the second half of the 5th/nth century it was still the centre of the most lively intellectual currents in Iranian life. Kirman, according to Muhammad b. Ibrahim, flourished under the firm rule of the local Saljuq line. There Qavurt suppressed the Baluchi brigands and put watchtowers, cisterns, and caravanserais along the caravan route through the desert to Sistan; foreign merchants were encouraged to trade with India and the east via Kirman, so that colonies of foreigners grew up in the capital there, and Qavurt was careful to maintain a high standard of coinage.4 Conditions in the adjacent province of Fars were less encouraging. Whereas Qavurt was largely successful in stopping the depredations of the Baluchis, Fars continued to be racked by brigands and by internecine warfare amongst the local Kurdish tribes of the Shabankara. Ibn al-Balkhi, writing in the first decade or so of the 12th century, records that the Saljuq governors in Fars—first Najm al-Daula KhumarTegin and then, after c. 493/1099, Fakhr al-Din Chavli—sent many

expeditions against the bandits but failed to pacify the province. Shïrâz, once the flourishing capital of the Buyids, was sacked on several occasions by both Turkmen and Shabânkâra'Is, and she did not recover till the end of the 6th/i2th century. The trade from the orient to the port of Sïrâf on the coast of Fârs was permanently ruined and the town itself depopulated by the piracy of the amirs of the island of Qais, whom frequent Saljuq expeditions failed to subdue.1
VII. EVENTS DURING MALIK-SHÂH'S REIGN
The military and political events of Malik-Shah's reign can conveniently be reviewed under three headings: first, the crushing of opposition from ambitious members of the Saljuq family ; second, the humbling of external foes on the eastern and north-western frontiers of Iran; and third, relations with the caliphate and the extension of Saljuq power into Syria and the Arabian peninsula. It was fortunate that Alp-Arslan lingered on for four days after he had been fatally wounded on the Oxus banks in Rabf I 465/November 1072 (see above, p. 65); for within these four days he was able to set out his final wishes. He had a numerous family, including his sons Malik-Shah, Ayaz, Tekish, Tutush, Bori-Bars, Toghan-Shâh, and Arslan-Arghun, but since 458/1066 Malik-Shah had been recognized as heir. Nizâm al-Mulk now secured recognition for him by sending to Baghdad asking that the khutba be made in his name. Malik-Shah himself dropped back to Nïshâpùr, the key city of Khurasan, and with the treasure from its citadel Nizam al-Mulk increased the salaries of the troops by a total of 700,000 dinars, "and thereby won over the hearts of the regular army ['askar] and the auxiliary troops [hashar] ". Not only was it necessary at this point to secure the loyalty of the army against possible rivals, but the Saljuqs were in the midst of a campaign against the Qarakhânids, and the vizier did not want the pressure on them relaxed. Alp-Arslan was mindful of the claims of his other relatives when he enjoined Malik-Shah to look after their due rights. His brother Qavurt, he said, was to continue in Kirmân and the parts of Fârs which he then held, and he was to receive a stipulated sum of money; his son Ayaz should rule the upper Oxus provinces from Balkh, for which he would have his grandfather Chaghri's annual

THE I R A N I A N W O R L D (A.D. IOOO-1217)
allowance of 500,000 dinars, but Malik-Shah was to keep a garrison in the citadel of Balkh.1 Obviously Qavurt was Malik-Shah's most serious potential rival, for he was Alp-Arslan's brother and a commander of great experience. Moreover he had ruled in Kirman for over thirty years. His Turkmen followers had settled on estates in the province (Muhammad b. Ibrahim calls them iqta^s)^ but Qavurt's success in taking over Kirman early in Toghril's reign had attracted thither larger numbers of Turk men than that relatively poor region could stand. Qavurt's policy had therefore been to divert them into those outlying parts that were infested with Baluchi brigands, and he also sent a force under his son Amiran-Shah against Sistan. As a further outlet for expansion he mounted an expedition against Oman, and after crossing the Persian Gulf in ships chartered from the local ruler of Hurmuz, he deposed the Buyid governor and brought Oman under Saljuq suzerainty. Qavurt, in fact, behaved almost as an independent ruler, adopting the royal insignia of a parasol (chatr\ stamping on documents a tughra or official emblem—this was the Saljuq bow and arrow symbol—and assuming regal titles.2 On hearing the news of Malik-Shah's accession, Qavurt hurried back to Kirman from Oman, losing several ships and many men in the crossing. He set before Malik-Shah a claim based on the principle of seniority: " I am the eldest brother, and you are a youthful son; I have the greater right to my brother Alp-Arslan's inheritance." Against this, Malik-Shah asserted the concept of father-son succession: " A brother does not inherit when there is a son." Qavurt then occupied Isfahan, and in 465 /1073 a three-day battle took place outside Hamadan. Fighting with his seven sons at his side, Qavurt expected the support, and even the defection to him, of much of his opponent's army. The Turks and Turkmen in Malik-Shah's forces did show this expected sympathy, although the sultan's ghulam commanders, such as SavTegin and Gauhar-A'in, stood firmly by their master. There was sharp tension in Malik-Shah's army between the Turkish elements and the contingents of Arabs and Kurds led by the 'Uqailid Sharaf alDaula Muslim b. Quraish and the Mazyadid Baha' al-Daula Mansur b. Dubais. The latter groups played a decisive part in crumpling up

Qavurt's right wing, and this blow against their fellow Turks so incensed Malik-Shah's own Turkish troops that some of them turned aside to plunder the baggage of the Arabs and Kurds as well as that of the caliph's envoy. This episode brings out the differing outlooks of the two constituents of the Saljuq army, the Turkish tribesmen and the multi-national professional and slave soldiery; the unreliability of the former must now have been quite clear to the sultan. With Qavurt defeated and captured, Malik-Shah was disposed to be merciful to his uncle, who at one point offered to retire to Oman; but Nizam al-Mulk was adamant, insisting that clemency would only be taken as a sign of weakness. According to Zahir al-Din Nishapuri, the sultan's army was still restive and threatening to support Qavurt if their pay and shares in the booty were not increased. Qavurt was strangled with a bowstring, presumably to prevent the spilling of royal blood, and two of his sons were at least partially blinded. MalikShah then appointed as amirs Rukn al-Daula Qutlugh-Tegin over Fars and Sav-Tegin over Kirman. T o mark the prominent role taken by the Arabs and Kurds, they were granted extensive fiefs and extra shares in the plunder.1 Malik-Shah eventually restored Kirman to Qavurt's sons; Rukn alDaula Sultan-Shah ruled from 467/1074 to 477/1085, followed by 'Imad al-Daula Turan-Shah from 477/1085 to 490/1097. A t one point Sultan-Shah's loyalty to the Saljuqs became ambiguous, and in 473/ 1080-1 Malik-Shah marched to the capital of Bardasir, receiving there Sultan-Shah's homage and contenting himself with the destruction of one of the towers in the citadel. Turan-Shah, the last survivor from amongst Qavurt's sons, was praised for his justice and piety, and his tomb became a place of pilgrimage. His vizier was the capable alMukarram b. al-'Ala', who won the gratitude of the common people of Bardasir by removing the turbulent Turkish soldiery from quarters within the town to a new suburb (rabad) outside it, where he also built himself a palace and erected several public buildings.2 It seems that the Saljuqs of Kirman kept control of Fars, for Ibn al-Athir records that in 487/1094, presumably just before her death, Terken Khatun deputed

the Amir Oner to wrest Fars from Turan-Shah. The attempt failed, in part because the sympathies of the local people were with TuranShah, who is reported to have been mortally wounded in the fighting.1 Baha' al-Daula Iran-Shah succeeded his father for a reign of five years (490-5/1097-1101), and during this time Fars continued to be a subject of dispute with the Great Saljuq sultans. Oner was again sent into Fars, this time by Berk-Yaruq to subdue Iran-Shah's allies the Shabankara'i Kurds, but he had to retire in defeat to Isfahan.2 In the eyes of the chroniclers, the most noteworthy feature of Iran-Shah's reign was his alleged acceptance of Isma'ili propaganda, which is reputed to have been disseminated in Kirman shortly after 486/1093. According to Ibn al-Athir it was brought by a secretary from Khuzistan, one Ibn Zur'a, but Muhammad b. Ibrahim says that it originated with the amir's companion, Kaka Baliman; it is possible that these two are one person. Iran-Shah was opposed by his own atabeg, Nasir al-Daula (this is the first tutor mentioned in the history of the Kirman Saljuqs), by the orthodox ulema, and also by his own commanders. The representatives of the religious institution finally issued a fatwd (legal decision) author izing the heretic ruler's deposition; Iran-Shah fled, but was finally trapped and killed.3 Shortly after Qavurt's revolt and death, Malik-Shah received with much relief the news of his own brother Ayaz's death. Balkh and Tukharistan were now granted to another of his brothers, Shihab al-Din Tekish, who installed himself in these territories after 466/10734, the year in which Malik-Shah defeated the Qarakhanid Shams alMulk and ejected his troops from the south bank of the Oxus. A further brother, Bori-Bars, was given the governorship of Herat, Gharchistan, and Ghur, while the sultan's uncle 'Uthman b. Chaghri Beg received Valvalij in eastern Tukharistan.4 For some years Tekish governed his province without recorded incident, until in 473/1080-1 the arrival of the 7,000 mercenaries whom Malik-Shah had discharged, and who now sought to enter Tekish's service, tempted him to rebel. But the sultan beat him in the race to secure Nishapur, the capital of Khurasan, and after being besieged in Tirmidh, Tekish was compelled

to yield. His brother pardoned him. Four years later, however, whilst Malik-Shah was at the opposite end of the empire in Mosul, where Fakhr al-Daula Ibn Jahir and Artuq Beg had been conducting opera tions against the 'Uqailids, Tekish again rebelled in Khurasan. His forces were held up at the fortress of Sarakhs, and the sultan managed to gain time for the march across Iran. Tekish was captured and now paid the penalty for his disloyalty: he was blinded and imprisoned, and his territories given to his son Ahmad.1 The firmness of Malik-Shah and Nizam al-Mulk in dealing with rebels from the Saljuq family forms a contrast to Alp-Arslan's comparatively lenient treatment of such claimants; but it seems to have had an exemplary effect, for there was no more trouble from the rest of the family for the remaining years of Malik-Shah's reign. It has been noted that towards the end of Alp-Arslan's reign, when warfare had broken out between the Saljuqs and the Qarakhanid Shams al-Mulk Nasr b. Ibrahim, the sultan's assassination gave the khan the opportunity to invade Tukharistan (see p. 65 above). Malik-Shah's brother Ayaz was unable to withstand the invaders, but once the new sultan was firmly on the throne, he came eastwards in 466/1073-4, drove Shams al-Mulk's brother from Tirmidh, and pushed on to Samarqand; the khan was now forced to seek the intercession of Nizam al-Mulk and sue for peace. Malik-Shah entrusted the key of Tirmidh to Sav-Tegin, with instructions for its refortification with stone walls and a ditch, and it was then that he gave the governorship of Balkh and Tukharistan to Tekish.2 A t some point in his reign Shams al-Mulk became involved in a war with the eastern branch of the Qarakhanids, who were ruled by the two sons of Qadir-Khan Yusuf of Kashghar and Khotan. Forced to abandon to them Farghana and the province of Ilaq north of the Syr Darya, he must have become eager to preserve peaceful relations with the Saljuqs.3 Like his father, Shams al-Mulk was famed for his equity and piety, particularly in the sphere of public buildings and charitable works. He built celebrated ribats at Khardhang near Karminiyya and also at Aq-Kutal on the Samarqand-Khujand road; the splendid palace of Shamsabad near Bukhara, and a Friday mosque in that city. Neverthe less he fell foul of the religious classes, and in 461/1069 was driven to

execute the Imam A b u Ibrahim Saffari. In the brief reign of Shams alMulk's brother Khidr Khan (472-3/1080-1) the western kingdom of the Qarakhanids is said to have reached its zenith of prosperity and splendour.1 Nothing is recorded of Saljuq-Qarakhanid relations for several years until the accession in Transoxiana of Ahmad Khan b. Khidr (473-82/1081-9), the nephew of Malik-Shah's wife Terken Khatun. Saljuq influence beyond the Oxus continued to be strong, and it is in this period that the double honorifics al-Dunya wa'l-Dw (" . . . of the Secular World and of Religion") first appear amongst the Qarakhanids (coin of 474/1081-2).2 However, Ahmad Khan stirred up the opposi tion of the orthodox religious institution to such a pitch that in 482/ 1089 a Shafi'I faqih, one A b u Tahir b. cAliyyak, came to Malik-Shah's court seeking aid.3 The sultan was at this time at the peak of his prestige. He had successfully settled affairs in Syria and al-Jazireh, humbling the pretensions of his brother Tutush and installing several of his reliable ghulam commanders as governors (see below, p. 98); he had also brought off a diplomatic coup by marrying his daughter to Caliph al-Muqtafi. He was accordingly well disposed to listen to the Transoxianan faqih's appeal for intervention against the impious khan. The sultan occupied Bukhara without difficulty; Samarqand was obstinately defended by its inhabitants, but Malik-Shah broke into it, captured Ahmad Khan, and deported him to his capital Isfahan. Leaving the civil governor of Khwarazm to hold Samarqand, the sultan now pushed on to Talas and into Semirechye with the aim of bringing the eastern Qarakhanids equally under his suzerainty. A t Uzkand he received the personal submission of the Khan of Kashghar, Harun b. Sulaiman b. Qadir-Khan Yusuf (d. 496/1103); the khan promised to place Malik-Shah in the khutba and offered one of his daughters in marriage to one of the sultan's sons. Meanwhile, the kingdom had become temporarily endangered by revolts among the people of Samarqand and among the Chigil or Qarluq tribesmen who had passed from Qarakhanid into Saljuq service; Nizam al-Mulk explains that Malik-Shah's failure to give the customary feasts for them had displeased them. A three-cornered struggle began with the appearance of Ya'qub-Tegin, brother of the

Khan of Kashghar, and Malik-Shah had to undertake the recovery of Samarqand and a further trip to Uzkand. Saljuq fortunes were helped by the eternally present family conflicts of the Qarakhanid dynasty. A new aggressor appeared, Toghril b. Inal, who drove the khan out of Kashghar.1 The sultan's representatives Taj al-Mulk now brought the khan and his brother Ya'qub-Tegin together, and left them to regain their territories as best they could; the sultan himself returned to Khurasan, and at some unknown time later restored Ahmad Khan to Samarqand.2 Soon afterwards, in 48 8/109 5, Ahmad Khan was overthrown and executed by the agents of the religious leaders in Samarqand, on the grounds that he had embraced Isma'IlI doctrines (see below, p. 106).3 Although there had been peace between the Ghaznavids and Saljuqs during Alp-Arslan's reign, the troubled events surrounding MalikShah's accession tempted Ibrahim of Ghazna to try and regain former Ghaznavid territory in Badakhshan and Tukharistan. He attacked Malik-Shah's uncle, the Amir al-Umara' cUthman b. Chaghri Beg, at a place named Sakalkand, then he sacked it and carried 'Uthman ignominiously off to Ghazna. (Since the latter was soon afterwards made Governor of Valvalij, he must have been speedily ransomed or released from captivity.) Malik-Shah sent an army under GumushTegin Bilge Beg and his slave Anush-Tegin Gharcha'I, and the status quo was presumably restored (465/1073). Little more is recorded of relations between the two sultans, though one other expedition by Malik-Shah against the Ghaznavids is mentioned. This got as far as Isfizar in western Afghanistan, where it was halted by a clever piece of psychological warfare on Ibrahim's part which made the Saljuq sultan believe that his own army was disaffected.4 The Ghaznavid empire in eastern Afghanistan and northern India flourished during Ibrahim's forty-year reign, and the sultan acquired a great reputation as a patron of learning and religion, building many mosques, madrasas, and public buildings. He made several fresh

conquests of fortresses in the Punjab, and after 469/1076-7 he assigned the governorship of India to his son Saif al-Daula Mahmüd, patron of the famous poet Mascüd-i Sa'd-i Salman. Ibrahim and Malik-Shah negotiated as equals, and marriage links between the two houses were kept up. Ibrahim's son, the later 'Alá' al-Daula Mas'üd III (492-508/ 1099-1115), had married a daughter of Alp-Arslan, and later he was to marry one of Malik-Shah's daughters, Jauhar Khatun, known in Ghazna as Mahd-i 'Iraq, "the wife from Iraq [i.e. western Persia]".1 The extent of Saljuq influence in Ghazna at this time can be seen in the Ghaznavid sultans' formal assumption of a typically Saljuq titleal-Sultan al-Mtfa%%am—in addition to their own normal ones of Amir and Malik', the title first appears on the coinage of Farrukh-Zád.2 Sistan had come under Saljuq suzerainty soon after the Ghaznavids' expulsion from Khurasan. Though it remained under the general supervision of the Saljuqs of Kirmán, it was left in practice to its own ancient rulers of the Saffarid line (see above, pp. 50-1). In 465/1073, the year of Malik-Shah's accession, it passed to Amir Bahá' al-Daula wa'1-Dln Táhir, but his authority was soon disputed by other powerful nobles of Sistán, in particular by one Badr al-Din Abu'l-'Abbas. The mediation of Malik-Sháh's governor in Khurasan was sought, yet internal strife ended only when Táhir was strangled by his opponent in 480/1088. Abu'l-'Abbás now moved against Kühistán, but he too died shortly afterwards. Malik-Shah himself was at this time occupied in Transoxiana; in 485/1092, however, the Saljuq amir Qizil-Sarigh linked up with one of the local amirs of Sistán, and until the sultan's death joint operations were conducted against the Isma'ilis of Kühistán. In Sistán itself, Táhir's son Táj al-Din Abu'1-Fadl Nasr came to power in 48 3/1090-1 as a Saljuq vassal, and after a long reign largely coter minous with that of Sanjar, he died a centenarian in 5 59/1164.3 Malik-Shah's concern with the north-western frontiers of Iran was twofold: first, to secure Arrán and thus protect Azarbáiján, and second, to hold the route that led up the Araxes into Armenia against any Georgian attack. During his reign, Azarbáiján conserved its importance both as a region of Turkmen concentration and as the base from which Turkmen amirs fighting in Anatolia drew replenish

ments for their forces; this importance was recognized by the sultan's eventually placing the whole of the Arran-Azarbaijan area under his cousin Qutb al-Din Isma'il b. Yaquti, who was given the title Malik. When Malik-Shah came to the throne, he considered that he needed to strengthen the somewhat nominal dependence of Fadl (Fadlun) III b. Fadl II, the Shaddadid ruler of Ganja and Dvin who had succeeded his father in 466/1073. Accordingly, the sultan sent an expedition to Arran; Ganja was occupied and Fadl deposed, receiving in exchange Astarabad in Gurgan. Sav-Tegin, already familiar with the area from his campaigns there in Alp-Arslan's time, was installed in Ganja as governor (?468/io75-6; the chronology of these events is uncertain). But aggressive activity by the king of Georgia, Bagrat IV's son Giorgi II (1072-89), led to the temporary recapture of Kars by the Christians. The sultan came personally to Georgia in 471/1078-9, and shortly afterwards he entrusted operations there to the Turkmen amir Ahmad, who regained Kars in 473/1080 and, after returning to his base in Arran, sent two more Turkmen begs, Ya'qub and 'Isa Bori, against Georgia. They penetrated as far as Lazistan and the Chorukh valley on the Black Sea coast and they also threatened Trebizond; according to Anna Comnena, this city was in fact taken, but was recaptured soon afterwards by a Byzantine general.1 A revolt by the restored Shaddadid Fadl III, probably after the death of Sav-Tegin in 478/1085, necessitated Malik-Shah's appearance in the Caucasus in 478/1086. After receiving the homage and tribute of the Shirvan-Shah Fariburz b. Sallar, the sultan reached the Black Sea coast, where the slave commander Bozan was detailed to take Ganja. Fadl was finally deposed and the Shaddadid line in Ganja extinguished, although the collateral line in Ani, under Amir Abu'1-Fadl Manuchihr, one of Malik-Shah's faithful vassals (?464-r. 512/? 1072-r. 1118), con tinued to flourish in the 6th/12th century. The Shirvan-Shah seems to have exercised some influence over Arran, but much of the Araxes basin was doubtless parcelled out into military fiefs and absorbed into the existing pattern of Turkmen occupation in Azarbaijan; the region as a whole was under the control of Qutb al-Din Isma'il.2

The sons of Qutlumush had arrived in Anatolia at the beginning of Malik-Shah's reign and had put themselves at the head of certain of the Turkmen bands which were gradually isolating and compelling the surrender of the remaining Byzantine strongholds in Anatolia. The later historiography of the Rum Saljuqs posits that Malik-Shah officially invested these sons with the governorships of Anatolia, intending the region to be an appanage of the Saljuq empire as Khura san, Kirman, and Damascus had been under Tutush. In fact, relations here were never very cordial. Assumption of the title Sultan by Qutlumush's sons (this occurred after c. 473/1080-1) seems to have been a unilateral act and cannot have pleased Malik-Shah, whose own title of Supreme Sultan implied an overlordship of the Saljuq family. Indeed, in 467/1075 two of Qutlumush's sons—Alp-Ilig and Daulab, in the view of Cahen—were fighting in Palestine for the Fatimids against Malik-Shah's lieutenant Atsiz b. Uvak.1 In Anatolia itself, the other sons Sulaiman and Mansur were taking advantage of the succession disputes which racked Byzantium until the last and most successful claimant, Alexis Comenus (1081-1118), emerged triumphant. The various contenders—Michael Dukas, Nicephorus Botaniates, Nicephorus Melissenos, and Alexis himself—all sought help from the Turks, with the result that by 474/1081 Sulaiman's forces had reached the shores of the Sea of Marmara and had taken Nicea (Iznik). Malik-Shah regarded his cousins in Anatolia as semirebels, and he cannot have viewed their successes with enthusiasm; his attitude towards Byzantium was no doubt the same as his fathers: that the two empires of the Greeks and the Saljuqs should exist side by side (see p. 62 above). Barhebraeus speaks of a punitive expedition under Amir Bursuq, sent by Malik-Shah c. 470/1077-8; though it succeeded in bringing about Mansur's death, Sulaiman had to be left with most of the western and southern parts of Anatolia.2 In Cappadocia, Pontus, and the east there were several other Turkmen begs, some related to the Saljuqs, others independent of them. Certain of the legends and traditions which surround the beginnings of the Turkmen Danishmand Beg ascribe to him a part in the victory of Malazgird, and they ascribe a similar role to Artuq, Mengiijek, and Saltuq, other Turkmen amirs who later became famous.3 In reality,

Danishmand Beg does not become a historically authenticated figure till the time of the First Crusade, in Berk-Yaruq's reign, but it is quite possible that the foundations of the important Danishmanid princi pality were being laid in the regions of Sivas, Kayseri, Amasya, and Tokat during the latter part of Malik-Shah's reign.1 However, events in the Anatolian interior were of less immediate importance to the Great Saljuqs than were those taking place on the south-eastern fringes of Anatolia, in al-Jazireh and in Syria. South of the Taurus and the Anatolian plateau we are outside the Irano-Turkish world on which the Saljuqs' political power and culture were based, and only a brief outline of the extension of Saljuq influence as against that of the Fatimids in Syria and Arabia need be given here. The tasks of Saljuq arms and diplomacy in the shifting and complex politics of this region to the south of Anatolia were, first, to ensure that cities like Antioch, Aleppo, and Edessa were in friendly Sunni Muslim hands; and second, to bring into the Sunni-Saljuq sphere of influence the local Arab amirates (e.g. those of the Mirdasids, the Banu Munqidh of Shaizar, and the Banu 'Ammar of Tripoli) as well as the tribal groups, such as those of Kilab and Numair, many of which were Start and possibly pro-Fatimid in sentiment. Roving Turkmen bands injected a fresh element of unrest into the region; and in the years after Malazgird an ephemeral but significant Greco-Armenian principality grew up along the Taurus under the leadership of Philaretos, a former general of Romanus Diogenes, who extended his power from Hisn Mansur, Abulustan, and Mar'ash, over the cities of Malatya, Samosata, Edessa, and Antioch.2 Malik-Shah's reign saw the destruction of the Marwanids, the longestablished Kurdish dynasty in Diyarbakr, although there are no indications that this action came from deliberate Saljuq policy; it was some decades since Fatimid influence had been a danger in this area. After the death of Nasr al-Daula Ibn Marwan in 453/1061, the power and splendour of the dynasty waned perceptibly under his sons, and its end came when the private ambitions of the Banu Jahir finally worked upon Malik-Shah and Nizam al-Mulk.3 Accompanied by a Saljuq army

and by the ghulam generals Qasim al-Daula Aq-Sonqur and GauharA'ln, and later helped by Artuq Beg, Fakhr al-Daula Ibn Jahir conducted a long and strenuous campaign in 477-8/1084 against the Marwanids in Amid, Mayyafariqin, and Jazirat ibn 'Umar, afterwards annexing Diyarbakr to the Saljuq empire and appropriating for his personal use the Marwanids' treasury.1 The disappearance of the Marwanids was a palpable threat to another local power, the 'Uqailids. By 477/1084 the dominions of the very capable Sharaf al-Daula Muslim b. Quraish stretched from Mosul through Diyar Rabi'a and Diyar Mudar to Manbij and Aleppo, and he had reached an entente with the Armenian general Philaretos, A t the beginning of his reign Malik-Shah had sent his brother Tutush to hold Syria as an appanage, and from his base of Damascus, Tutush and later Artuq Beg conquered all the territories in southern Syria and Palestine formerly held by Atsi'z b. Uvak. The prize of Aleppo brought Tutush into rivalry with its ruler, Sharaf al-Daula Muslim, and in 477/1084 a complex pattern of warfare broke out in the region of Aleppo and Antioch, involving Tutush, Sharaf al-Daula Muslim, Philaretos, Sulaiman b. Qutlumush, and an army from Isfahan under the personal command of Malik-Shah and his generals Bozan and Bursuq. In the fighting the 'Uqailid was killed (478/1085), while Sulaiman either died in battle or else committed suicide (479/1086). The sultan's Syrian campaign was crowned with triumph as one after another Mosul, Harran, Aleppo, and Antioch submitted, and he was at last able to let his horse stand on the shores of the Mediterranean. When Tutush and Artuq had withdrawn to Damascus and Jerusalem respectively, Malik-Shah installed ghulam governors in Antioch (Yaghi-Basan), Aleppo (Aq-Sonqur), and Edessa (Bozan).2 Saljuq influence during his reign was even carried into the Arabian peninsula. In 469/1076-7 Artuq marched through al-Ahsa' in eastern Arabia as far as Qatlf and Bahrain Island, attacking the local Qarmatian sectaries en route. After the sultan's second visit to Baghdad, in 484/1091, he conceived the idea of making it the centre of his empire (see below, p. 101), and it was probably in connexion with this that he deputed

Gauhar-A'in and Chabaq to bring the Hijaz and the Yemen under his power. Through his diplomacy the khutba at Mecca was returned to the 'Abbasids in 468/1075-6, which meant in effect that he had out bid the Fatimids for the support of the venal Sharif of Meccaalthough according to Ibn al-Jauzi, there was also a project for the sharif to marry one of the sultan's sisters. In the last year of MalikShah's life, Gauhar-A'in sent a force of Turkmen under Tirsek and Chabaq, and the Yemen and Aden were temporarily occupied.1 The exclusion of the 'Abbasid caliphs from secular affairs in Iraq was maintained during Malik-Shah's reign, and on his first visit to Baghdad, in 479-80/1086-7, he had received the formal grant of this secular authority from al-Muqtadi. Within Baghdad the sultan's shahna, or military commander, was Gauhar-A'in, who had been appointed in his father's reign. Not only did he have the task of keeping public order in the city and of mediating among the hostile factions of Shfis, Hanbalis, 'ayyars, and so on, but Gauhar-A'in also had a general responsibility for the security of Iraq; thus when in 483/ 1090 a force of 'Amiri Bedouins from the Qarmatians of al-Ahsa' sacked Basra, he had to come from Baghdad and restore order.2 Financial and civil affairs in the capital and in Iraq in general—including supervision of those iqta's allotted to the caliph, together with the transmission to him of their revenues—were the responsibility of a civilian 'amid or governor. In the latter part of Malik-Shah's reign, when relations between sultan and caliph became very strained, the c amid clearly had the power of making life unpleasant in many ways for the caliph. One 'amid, Abu'l-Fath b. Abi Laith, even interfered with the caliph's own court and retinue, until in 475/1082-3 al-Muqtadi com plained to the sultan and Nizam al-Mulk.3 For most of Malik-Shah's reign Nizam al-Mulk was left to mould Saljuq policy towards the caliphate, and this meant that he was thrown into close contact with the caliph's viziers; down to 507/1113-14, with only a few breaks, the vizierate for the 'Abbasids continued to be held by the Banu Jahir, namely Fakhr al-Daula and his sons 'Amid al-Daula and Za'Im al-Ru'asa'. Saljuq pressure on the caliphate increased during this period, as the firm hand of Gauhar-A'in in Baghdad showed. A t the opening of the reign Nizam al-Mulk had reversed his previously conciliatory attitude, and the climax of this new harshness came in

471/1079, when he secured Fakhr al-Daula's dismissal on the pretext that he was behind Hanbali attacks on the Nizamiyya madrasa. He even tried, without success, to impose on the caliph his own son Mu'ayyid al-Mulk as vizier. The family's fortunes were restored through the tact of 'Amid al-Daula Ibn Jahir, who came personally to Nizam al-Mulk's camp to intercede for his father's restoration, and who in the following years grew so close to Nizam al-Mulk that he was given successively two of the vizier's daughters in marriage.1 Over the next few years the Banu Jahir oscillated between support for the interests of the sultan and for those of the caliph. In 474/1081-2 Fakhr al-Daula and Nizam al-Mulk arranged the betrothal of one of MalikShah's daughters to the caliph, but the condition was imposed on alMuqtadi that he should take no concubine and no other wife but this Saljuq princess. Hence by 476/1083-4 al-Muqtadi had lost all patience, and he installed as vizier a firm supporter of his own interests, A b u Shuja' al-Riidhrawari; Nizam al-Mulk was furious that his ally 'Amid al-Daula should be dismissed, and according to Sibt b. al-Jauzi he even contemplated abolition of the caliphate.2 Harmony was restored for a time when Malik-Shah, victorious after his Syrian campaign, visited Baghdad for the first time. Nizam al-Mulk took the opportunity of impressing the caliph with the military might of the sultanate by parading before him the Saljuq amirs—they numbered over forty—while he detailed their iqta's and the number of their retainers. The sultan's euphoria at this time was such that he increased the caliph's own iqta's, and at the same time abolished throughout Iraq illegal taxes, transport dues on goods, and the transit payment levied on pilgrims.3 The marriage alliance with the caliphate was celebrated in 480/1087 with enormous pomp, in the presence of Nizam al-Mulk, Abu Sa'd the Mustaufi, Terken Khatun, and the caliph's vizier Abu Shuja'. Very soon a son was born, the short-lived Abu'1-Fadl Ja'far.4 Nizam al-Mulk's reception at Baghdad turned him into a warm partisan of the caliphate, but the marriage did not bring the expected harmony between sultan and caliph. A s early as 481/1088 the Turks who had accompanied the Saljuq princess were expelled

from the caliph's harem because of their rowdiness. By the next year the princess was complaining to her father of al-Muqtadfs neglect of her, so Malik-Shah demanded the return of his daughter and his grand son Ja'far; she died shortly after reaching Isfahan, but her son, the socalled "Little Commander of the Faithful", became the sultan's favourite.1 During Malik-Shah's second visit to Baghdad relations with alMuqtadi were at their nadir, and the sultan ignored him. He resolved, however, to make Baghdad his winter capital, and in the winter of 484-5/1091-2 extensive building operations were begun in the city, comprising a great mosque, markets, and caravanserais, while the im portant ministers such as Nizam al-Mulk and Taj al-Mulk were ordered to build houses there for themselves. The sultan came to Baghdad again at the end of 485/1092. Nizam al-Mulk had just been assassinated and the sultan, freed from all restraint, decided to expel the caliph from his ancient capital, delivering this ultimatum to him. " Y o u must relinquish Baghdad to me, and depart to any land you choose." It seems that the sultan had the idea of setting up his grandson Ja'far as caliph, even though his tender age of five years made him ineligible according to Islamic law. As events turned out, al-Muqtadi was saved when MalikShah died from a fever, fifty-three days after the passing of Nizam al-Mulk.2 During the last two or three years of Malik-Shah's reign, certain disquieting events occurred which showed that his impressive empire was not unassailable. In 483/1090, for example, Basra was savagely sacked by Qarmatians.3 More serious was the emergence of several centres of Isma'iH activities within the empire, notably in Syria, alJazireh, and Persia. Propagandists having connexions with the Nizari faction in Fatimid Egypt began work in such parts of Iran as Kirman, Tukharistan, Kuhistan, Qumis, the Caspian provinces, and Fars (see above, p. 90). Those regions where there were already pockets of Shi'ism or of older Iranian beliefs seem to have been particularly susceptible. The Isma'ilis were even active in the capital city of Isfahan, under the da'i cAbd al-Malik b. 'Attash and his son Ahmad, who in Berk-Yaruq's reign was to seize the nearby fortress of Shahdiz. Another da'I, Hasan-i Sabbah, worked in Ray during Malik-Shah's time, and in

483/1090 he seized the fortress of Alamüt in the Alburz mountains near Qazvin. In the last year of his life Malik-Sháh, conscious of this threat to the line of communications through northern Persia, sent the amirs Arslan-Tash and Qizil-Sarigh against the Isma'ilis of Alamüt and Kühistán, respectively, but operations were broken off at his death.1 At Sihna, a place in Fárs on the Isfahan-Baghdad road, Nizam alMulk had met death at the hands of a Dailami youth, ostensibly a fida'i (assassin) of the Isma'ills.2 Several sources state that shortly before this killing, the sultan had dismissed him and several of his proteges in the administration, putting in their places Táj al-Mulk and his friends; it is also possible that Nizam al-Mulk, now at an advanced age, laid down office of his own accord. Y e t one of the earliest sources, Anushírván b. Khálid, says nothing of Nizam al-Mulk's departure from office. Contemporaries generally attributed his death to the machina tions of Malik-Shah and Táj al-Mulk, and the view is expressed by the later historian Rashid al-Dln (d. 718/1318) that the vizier's enemies at court concocted the murder in association with the Assassins; in view of Rashid al-Din's access to the Isma'IlI records at Alamüt, the story is worthy of consideration. The last weeks of Malik-Shah's own life were spent in drawing up his extravagant plans for the deposition of alMuqtadi. After 485/1092 the caliphs would never again have to fear so powerful a member of the Great Saljuq dynasty.3

The twelve years that followed Malik-Sháh's death were ones of internal confusion and warfare, ended only by Berk-Yaruq's death in 498/beginning of 1105. Despite this, the external frontiers of the empire held firm thanks to Malik-Shah and his vizier, whose policy had been to buttress the north-western frontiers through the concentration of

Turkmen in Azarbaijan and Arran, and to hold the Qarakhanids firmly in check on the north-eastern borders. Sanjar's governorship in eastern Khurasan and Tukharistan from 490/1097 onwards discouraged possible moves by the Ghaznavids at this time, though they might well have seen in this period of Saljuq confusion a heaven-sent chance to recover their terra irredenta. Only in the extreme west was there potential disquiet with the appearance in 1097 of the First Crusade: within three years the Franks had entrenched themselves on the Levant coast, had advanced as far as western Diyarbakr, and had taken such key cities as Jerusalem, Antioch, and Edessa. Y e t the Islamic world had seen aggressive infidels on its borders before. Moreover the Saljuq sultans were never directly threatened by the Crusaders, and they regarded the troubles of Tutush and his family in Syria as his own affair. When the news of the First Crusaders' successes in Syria first reached Baghdad, Berk-Yaruq wrote letters to the various amirs urging them to go and fight the unbelievers (Rabf II 491 /March 1098), but this exhortation seems to have exhausted his concern.1 There are few indications that thoughts of the Frankish threat seriously worried at any time the contestants who fought over the heartland of the empire, Iran and Iraq. When Malik-Shah died, Taj al-Mulk and Terken Khatun acted vigorously. Their policy in building up a party amongst Nizam alMulk's enemies in the army and bureaucracy, together with the fact that they happened to be in Baghdad at the crucial time, enabled them to place the four-year-old prince Mahmud on the throne as sultan, the caliph being reluctantly forced to grant him the honorific Ndsir alDunya waH-Dtn (" Helper in Secular and Religious Affairs "). Occupation of Isfahan was now the next aim, for despite large accession subsidies the army was again restive for pay. Mahmud was placed on the throne in Isfahan and the royal treasuries thrown open. Meanwhile the rival party of the Nizamiyya, which contained the great vizier's relatives and partisans, led by the ghulam Er-Ghush, had managed to seize the armaments stored up by the vizier at Isfahan and had taken with them to Ray the twelve-year-old Abu'l-Muzaffar Berk-Yaruq (Turkish for "strong brightness"). A t Ray the ra'ts, or chief notable, crowned him sultan. Anushirvan b. Khalid states that only obscure, people and opportunists supported Berk-Yaruq and that the majority favoured Mahmud; but this merely reflects Khalid's partisanship for Berk-Yaruq's

rival Muhammad, under whom he later became Mustaufl and 'Arid al-Jaish.1 As a youth approaching manhood, Berk-Yaruq was clearly more fitted to hold together his father's heritage, and in the struggle against Tutush and Muhammad he generally had the support of the Nizamiyya. This does not necessarily imply that the Nizamiyya had a collective policy, for none of the sons of Nizam al-Mulk was his father's equal in ability, and opportunism and personal factors seem often to have swayed them. A t the outset they desired vengeance on Taj al-Mulk, who was captured on the defeat of Terken Khatun in 48 5/beginning

of 1093. Mindful of his capabilities, however, Berk-Yaruq wished to make him vizier, and Taj al-Mulk mollified a good proportion of the Nizamiyya by judicious payments; but an irreconcilable element of them finally secured his death.1 In the next few years personal animosities among Nizam al-Mulk's sons placed them on opposite sides in the conflict. Berk-Yaruq's first vizier was the drunkard 'Izz al-Mulk Husain, and then in 487/1094 the capable Mu'ayyid al-Mulk 'Ubaidallah. Unfortunately, the hostility of the sultan's mother Zubaida Khatun led to his dismissal, and a further son, Fakhr al-Mulk Abu'l Muzaffar, was appointed in his place. The latter and Mu'ayyid al-Mulk were strong enemies, for they had quarrelled over some jewels left by their father, and henceforth Mu'ayyid al-Mulk became the guiding spirit behind Muhammad's bid for the sultanate.2 Terken Khatun's final act was to invite another member of the Saljuq family, Isma'Il b. Yaquti, to march against Berk-Yaruq. Although Isma'Il collected an army from the Turkmen of Azarbaijan and Arran, he was defeated and Berk-Yaruq's former atabeg Gumush-Tegin put him to death. From Isfahan Terken Khatun tried to make contact with Tutush, but she died suddenly in 487/1094, to be followed a month later by her son Mahmud.3 Early in this year Berk-Yaruq disposed of two other possible rivals, his uncle Tekish, who had been blinded by Malik-Shah and imprisoned at Takrit, and Tekish's son; Tekish, in an attempt to overthrow the youthful sultan, had allegedly been in touch with former supporters in his old appanage of Tukharistan.4 Despite the firmness of A l p Arslan and Malik-Shah, the traditional idea of a paternal inheritance divided amongst members of the family, coupled with the absence of any clear succession law, came to the surface in these uncertain times. In addition to his struggle with Terken Khatun, Berk-Yaruq was faced with a coup d'etat in the east by one uncle, Arslan-Arghun, and in the west by a bid for the sultanate from another uncle, Taj al-Daula Tutush. Arslan-Arghun's rebellion was the less dangerous, for he seems to have had only the limited aim of making Khurasan an autonomous province for himself. On hearing of Malik-Shah's death he left his iqta' in Jibal, seized several of the cities of Khurasan, and demanded

recognition as tributary ruler of the whole province except for Nishapur. Against him Berk-Yaruq sent his uncle Bori-Bars b. Alp-Arslan, who had some initial successes but was captured in 488/1095 and strangled. Arslan-Arghun now began a reign of terror in Khurasan, purging it of disaffected amirs and demolishing the walls and fortifications of potentially rebellious places. It was his excesses which caused one of his own ghulams to murder him in 490/1097. Berk-Yaruq had mean while appointed his half-brother Sanjar as governor in Khurasan, providing him with an atabeg and vizier. A feeble attempt to set up Arslan-Arghun's young son in Balkh collapsed, and Berk-Yaruq and his army spent seven months at Balkh suppressing a further revolt by a Saljuq claimant, Muhammad b. Sulaiman b. Toghril, who had received aid from the Ghaznavids (for more on this see p. 136 below). Beyond the Oxus, the situation in the Qarakhanid lands was somewhat troubled after the deposition and death of Ahmad Khan in 488/1095 (see p. 93 above), which was followed shortly afterwards by the death of his successor Mas'ud; Berk-Yaruq now confirmed the succession in Samarqand on Sulaiman and then on Mahmud Khan.1 The threat from Tutush was far more serious, for it threatened the whole basis of Berk-Yaruq's sultanate. Soon after his brother's death, Tutush had left Damascus accompanied by the ghulam commanders whom Malik-Shah had installed in Syria, Aq-Sonqur, Yaghi-Basan, and Bozan; and in 486/1093 in the city of Baghdad he proclaimed himself sultan. He routed the Arabs of the 'Uqailid Ibrahim b. Quraish of Mosul, and in Baghdad itself Malik-Shah's former shahna, GauharA'in, showed himself favourable to the new ruler. Soon afterwards his plans were disrupted by the desertion of Aq-Sonqur and Bozan, but in the next year Tutush killed these two undependable com manders and resumed the attack. Berk-Yaruq was recognized in Baghdad by the new caliph, al-Mustazhir (487-512/1094-1118), who granted him the honorific Rukn al-Dln ("Pillar of Religion"), but Tutush was soon in occupation of all the western lands of the empire, and Berk-Yaruq had the misfortune to fall into the hands of Mahmud's partisans at Isfahan, who planned to blind him and so render him unfit for the sultanate. Before doing this, however, they decided to wait and see whether the child Mahmud should recover from his

smallpox. A s we have seen, he did not recover: thus Berk-Yaruq's sight was saved, and those many amirs who feared Tutush now rallied to the sultan. Even so, his position still seemed desperate, for he him self was suddenly stricken with smallpox; but now he had the help of Mu'ayyid al-Mulk as vizier, and he was even given a breathing space when Tutush withdrew temporarily to Ray, probably because the provisioning of his large army in mid-winter was proving difficult. Berk-Yaruq soon collected 30,000 troops and defeated Tutush near Ray; during the battle one of Aq-Sonqur's ghulams avenged his master and slew Tutush (488/1095). The remnants of his army fled to Syria, and Berk-Yaruq seemed secure on the throne.1 The seat of Berk-Yaruq's personal power was essentially Iraq and western Iran. Khurasan, of course, always remained important to the Saljuqs because it had been the cradle of their power, and in the brief period of peace before the rise of his rival Muhammad, the sultan devoted to it as much attention as he was able. He went personally to suppress Arslan-Arghun's revolt, but shortly after his return to Iraq in the latter part of 490/1097, he had to send the Amir-i Dad ("Chief Justiciar") Habashi b. Altun-Taq to deal with Qodun, the governor of Marv, and with another amir, Yaruq-Tash. These two had killed the Saljuq governor of Khwarazm, Ekinchi b. Qochqar, and had tried to annex the province for themselves, but Habashi suppressed the out break and appointed as Khwarazm-Shah a man named Qutb al-Dln Muhammad b. Anush-Tegin Gharcha'i, founder of the line of shahs who were to play such a big role in Persian history in the decades before the Mongol invasions (see below, pp. 185 ff.). After this, distractions in the west forced Berk-Yaruq to leave Khurasan to Sanjar.2 Likewise, he granted Ganja to Sanjar's uterine brother, Muhammad, with Qutlugh-Tegin as his atabeg; very soon Muhammad threw off the latter's control, killing him and taking over the whole of Arran. Syria was always of peripheral importance to Great Saljuqs, and BerkYaruq never went there in person, despite al-Mustazhir's message to

him in 491/1098 expressing alarm at the successes of the Crusaders. Tutush's two sons Ridwan and Duqaq were left in Aleppo and Damas cus respectively, where they were duly provided with atabegs. The for merly 'Uqailid amirate of Mosul then passed to a succession of Turkish and Turkmen commanders. In central Iraq, Saif al-Daula Sadaqa (479-501/ 1086-1108) made the Mazyadids a considerable power in this period. He intervened frequently in the confused affairs of Baghdad—this city alternated between allegiance to Berk-Yaruq and to his rivals Tutush and then Muhammad—and in 496/1103 he added the formerly 'Uqailid town of Hit to his possessions.1 Farther south, in the marshlands of the Batiha, there was the local dynasty of the Banu Abi'l-Jabr under Muhadhdhib al-Daula Abu'l-'Abbas. Basra and Wasit were nominally under Berk-Yaruq's control, but the Turkish muqta's of this region were in practice little troubled.2 In Khuzistan and its chief town Shustar, ToghriTs former amir Bursuq and his four sons established themselves as hereditary muqta's. These sons remained generally attached to BerkYaruq's cause, and the sultan on more than one occasion dropped back from central Iran into Khuzistan to rest and to assemble fresh armies.3 The remaining years of Berk-Yaruq's reign, from 490/1097 to 498/ 1105, were taken up with the struggle against his half-brother Abu Shuja* Muhammad Tapar (Tapar = Turkish for "he who obtains, finds"),4 who, in accordance with his claim to the sultanate, secured from the caliph in 492/1099 the honorific Ghiydth al-Dunyd wcfl-Din ("Support in Secular and Religious Affairs").5 These years were full of warfare and of shifting alliances amongst the Turkish amirs. Mu hammad received much help from Sanjar; he also had at his disposal the administrative skill of Mu'ayyid al-Mulk, and the bulk of the Nizamiyya now fought on his side. For his part, Berk-Yaruq had only his own military skill and the loyalty of a nucleus of amirs, including Ayaz and the governor of Hamadan, II Ghazi. Even for the support of the sons of Bursuq he had to pay a price: in 492/1099 Zangi and Aq-B6ri insisted that he sacrifice his vizier Majd al-Mulk Abu'1-Fadl

BERK-YARUQ AND MUHAMMAD al-Balasani, who had Shi'I sympathies and was allegedly privy to the Isma'ilis' assassination of Bursuq.1 The accusation that he had Isma'IlI sympathies was frequently hurled at Berk-Yaruq by his opponents. On the occasions when his fortunes were low he certainly seems to have accepted Isma'IlI troops in his army;2 and it is said that when besieging Terken Khatun and Mahmud in Isfahan, he feigned sym pathy in order to get the support of local Isma'ilis. But there are no signs of an active sympathy with these schismatics, which would have brought down on his head fierce condemnation from the Sunni religious institution and from the 'Abbasid caliph.
A former governor of Fars whose reputation there had been damaged by his failure to quell the Shabankara, the Amir Oner, was persuaded by Mu'ayyid al-Mulk to rebel against Berk-Yaruq. In 492/1099 Oner took 10,000 troops to Ray, but his rising collapsed when he was murdered by a Turkish ghulam; as so often happened when an army became leaderless, the troops mutinied, plundered the dead commander's treasury, and then scattered. Mu'ayyid al-Mulk now fled to Ganja, becoming vizier to Muhammad, who at this point formally proclaimed himself sultan. The killing of his own vizier al-Balasani created a crisis of confidence for Berk-Yaruq. He still had a fair-sized army under Inal b. Anush-Tegin, as well as the help of one of Nizam al-Mulk's sons, I z z al-Din Mansur; yet Isfahan refused to admit him, and then his mother Zubaida Khatun was captured at Ray and strangled by Mu'ayyid al-Mulk. Support for Muhammad was growing among the Turkish amirs of Iraq and al-Jazireh, men such as Kiir-Bugha in Mosul and Chokermish in Jazirat ibn 'Umar; in Kurdistan the 'Annazid Surkhab b. Badr joined him, and in Baghdad Gauhar-A'in secured the khutba for him.3 Still further changes of allegiance took place. When in 493/1100 Berk-Yaruq faced his brother in battle, he had at his side Gauhar-A'in, Kiir-Bugha, Surkhab, and the Mazyadid 'Izz al-Daula Muhammad b. Sadaqa. This clash, the first of five between the rival sultans, neverthe less ended disastrously for Berk-Yaruq. He fled from Hamadan to Nishapur, seeking for help from the governor Habashi, and it is on this march through northern Iran that he is said to have joined forces with

5,000 Isma'lH troops, presumably from Dailam or Kuhistan. He then marched across Iran to Khuzistan, where Bursuq's sons Zangi and Il-Begi gave him their support, and in the second battle with Muham mad, in 494/1101, the latter was defeated and Mu'ayyid al-Mulk captured. In revenge for his mother, and because the vizier had imputed to him Isma'ill sympathies, Berk-Yaruq killed him personally.1 Muhammad now called in Sanjar from Balkh, and the union of their two armies caused support to melt from Berk-Yaruq. Part of his forces had to be detached and sent with Kiir-Bugha to Azarbaijan, where Maudud b. Isma'il b. Yaquti was in revolt against Berk-Yaruq and was vowing vengeance for his father. Problems of logistics and an inability to pay his troops troubled the sultan. He appeared in Baghdad with 5,000 unruly cavalrymen who plundered the Sawad and made his cause very unpopular, and when he tried to get a subsidy from the caliph by asking for the arrears of tribute from the Mazyadid ruler Sadaqa, he only caused the latter to declare for Muhammad.2 N o w he had to retreat southwards into Khuzistan, destroy the bridges behind him to prevent pursuit. Muhammad's followers had jeeringly called his troops Batiniyya, and at some point during his withdrawal from Baghdad, Berk-Yaruq carried out a purge of the Isma'llis in his army. The organizer of Isma'IlI propaganda in the army is said to have been one of the last scions of the Kakuyids, Muhammad b. Dushmanziyar of Yazd; whether this fact is an instance of Dailami heterodoxy, or just a fiction hiding other reasons for his killing, is unknown.3 The third battle, at Rudhravar in 495/1102, consisted of indecisive personal combats, after which negotiations were opened up and a settlement reached. Muhammad was to bear the title of Malik and have Arran, Azarbaijan, Diyarbakr, al-Jazireh, and Mosul; whilst BerkYaruq was to have all the rest and the title of Sultan. But Muhammad repudiated this in less than two months and arrogated for himself the sultan's privilege of five naubas (salutes of military music). He was routed in a fourth battle and shut himself in Isfahan, after hurriedly restoring the walls around 'Ala' al-Daula Ibn Kakuya's palace. Berk-Yaruq now

began a nine-month siege of the city during which the occupants suffered terrible deprivations, though Muhammad managed to escape. Simultaneously the struggle for power in Baghdad and Iraq was being carried on by Berk-Yaruq's shahna, Gumush-Tegin al-Qaisari, and Muhammad's shahna II Ghazi b. Artuq. Then in 496/1103 Berk-Yaruq marched into Azarbaijan against Muhammad and Maudud b. Isma'il b. Yaqtiti, and a fifth and last battle, again a defeat for Muhammad, took place at Khuy between Lakes Urmiyeh and Van.1 Berk-Yaruq's illnesses and the exhaustion of his resources inclined him to make peace in 497/1104, even though he held at this time most of western and central Iran, along with Iraq and Diyarbakr. There was to be a full divisio imperii, each ruler becoming sultan in his own lands. Muhammad was to have north-western Iran, Diyarbakr, al-Jazireh, Mosul, and Syria; Berk-Yaruq was to have the core of the empire, Jibal, Tabaristan, Fars, Khuzistan, Baghdad, and the Haramain, i.e. Mecca and Medina; whilst Sanjar was to remain in Khurasan, making the khutba for Muhammad. Whether this precarious arrangement would have lasted can only be surmised. A year later Berk-Yaruq died, leaving an infant son Malik-Shah as his successor and Ayaz as his atabeg. Ayaz and Il-Ghazi proclaimed him in Baghdad, but Muham mad marched there via Mosul and Ayaz, and Vizier al-Safl Sa'd al-Mulk Abu'l-Mahasin decided that resistance was hopeless. Muhammad thus became sultan over the whole of the Saljuq territories.2
The verdict of posterity has been that Berk-Yaruq was not a man of his father's calibre. Yet it is not surprising that he burnt himself out by the age of twenty-five, for he campaigned ceaselessly, was often ill, and was several times wounded by assassins. He was never able to dislodge Muhammad from Azarbaijan, and he had continuously to defend the core of his territories, Fars and Jibal, while also attempting to maintain his influence in Iraq. The divisions of power between Berk-Yaruq and Muhammad demonstrated cogently how vital was the principle of a patrimonial share-out. The role of the ghulam commanders and the Turkmen begs becomes very prominent in this period, and local Turkmen dynasties

begin to form: the sons of Bursuq in Khuzistan; the Artuqids in Diyarbakr; at Khilat the Shah-Armanids, descendants of Isma'Il b. Yaquti's ghulam Sukman al-Qutbl; and shortly afterwards the Zangids, descendants of Aq-Sonqur, in Mosul. Other local dynasties, e.g. the 'Annazids and Mazyadids, persisted and even strengthened their position. After Malik-Shah's death there were many young Saljuq princes in provincial appanages, each normally provided with a Turkish ghulam as his atabeg. These tutors not only exercised power on their charges' behalf, but often succeeded in arrogating effective power for themselves, especially after the death of Sultan Muhammad in 5 1 1 / 1 1 1 8 ; towards the middle of the century, for example, the family of Eldigiiz, atabeg of Arslan b. Toghril b. Muhammad, founded a powerful, autonomous dynasty in the north-west.1 A further notable feature of the 6th/12th century was a rise in the prestige and actual power of the 'Abbasid caliphate, due in large part to the need of rival claimants for caliphal support and confirmation of titles. Many of the troops of Berk-Yaruq and Muhammad were furnished by the Turkish amirs, whose frequent changes of side show that their interest lay in opposing the reconstitution of an effective central power; yet their attitude did ensure that, however crushingly any contestant was defeated, he could generally reassemble forces fairly quickly. The worst sufferers were, of course, the populations of Iran and the Sawad of Iraq, across which armies were constantly marching. The rival sultans were rarely able to collect regular territorial taxation, and irregular levies were therefore resorted to, above all when cities changed hands: e.g. Muhammad's generals Inal b. Anush-Tegin and his brother cAli collected 200,000 dinars from Isfahan in 496/1102.2 T o satisfy the soldiery, estates were often confiscated and parcelled out as iqta's amongst them; it was said against Berk-Yaruq's vizier, al-'Amid al-A'azz Abu'l-Mahasin al-Dihistani, that he even seized private properties and turned them into iqta's.3 Practices like these inevitably contributed to economic and social regression after the period of internal peace under Malik-Shah. Scorched-earth tactics were another recognized military measure. When in 498/1105 Chokermish was threatened at Mosul by Muhammad, he gathered everyone inside the walls of the city and then devastated the surrounding countryside. The ravages of Sanjar's army in 494/1101

as he marched through Qumis to join Muhammad at Ray were par ticularly severe, causing famine and reducing people to cannibalism.1 This general decline in security also encouraged sectarian and factional disturbance. In the cities of Khurasan, for instance, the old 'asabiyydt (factions), involving unpopular groups such as the Shi'a and Karamiyya, flared up; in Kurdistan there was fighting between the 'Annazid Surkhab and the Turkmen of the Salghur tribe, who had been dis possessing the indigenous Kurds of their pastures.2 Above all, the sources state that disturbed conditions favoured the spread of Isma'ilism, especially in Kuhistan and Fars. In northern Syria Ridwan b. Tutush earned himself eternal obloquy from Sunni historians by his use of local Isma'ills in warfare against his brother. Berk-Yaruq massacred Isma'ills in western Iran and Baghdad, and other amirs carried out operations in Dailam, Fars, and Khuzistan, without, however, permanently dislodging the sectaries from their strongholds.3 Some of the greatest successes of the Batiniyya in this period were in Kuhistan, where large stretches of territory were under their regular control. Mentioned amongst their allies is a certain alMunawwar, a descendant of the Simjurid family who in the 4th/ioth century had held Kuhistan from the Samanids. Sanjar sent both regular troops and ghazis into the province, but the most he could achieve was an agreement with the Isma'Ilis that they should voluntarily limit their activities.4 Muhammad reigned for thirteen years as undisputed sultan (498-511/ 1105-18), while his brother Sanjar remained at Balkh as his viceroy in the east, receiving the title of Malik. Whilst the sources are lukewarm about Berk-Yaruq, they eulogize Muhammad as "the perfect man of the Saljuqs and their mighty stallion", praising his zeal for the Sunna and his hatred of the Batiniyya.5 They do not, on the other hand, reveal him to be a more capable ruler or soldier than Berk-Yaruq. Several facts explain Muhammad's popularity in pious circles. First, it was his fortune to secure sole power after the kingdom had been

gripped by civil war for years, and at a time when it was economically exhausted and ready to accept anyone who could give peace. This period of peace enabled the sultan to give moral encouragment and a certain amount of indirect military help to the Syrian amirs, who were struggling to contain the Crusaders; even more important, he was able to take action against the Isma'Uls in Persia, who, profiting by the previous disorders, had consolidated their position in Dailam, Pars, and Kuhistan. Finally, Muhammad was the last Great Saljuq to have firm and undisputed control of western Iran and Iraq, the heartland of the sultanate since Toghril's time. After his death his sons ruled successively as subordinates of San jar, and the centre of gravity of the sultanate tended to shift eastwards to its birthplace, Khurasan. Since the sources are usually partial to Nizam al-Mulk and his descendants, their picture of Muhammad is influenced by the fact that he received support from the majority of the Nizamiyya, which began when Mu'ayyid al-Mulk first espoused his cause in 492/1099. Muhammad also employed Nasir al-Mulk b. Mu'ayyid al-Mulk, first as his chief secretary and then as vizier to his sons; and in 5 0 0 / 1 1 0 7 Diva al-Mulk Ahmad b. Nizam al-Mulk, became his own vizier for four years, the sultan insisting on having one of the family because of their innate capability and auspiciousness (baraka).1 The ambiguous attitudes and shifting allegiances of the Turkish, Kurdish, and Arab amirs of Jibal, Iraq, al-Jazireh, and Diyarbakr had added much to the confusion of Berk-Yaruq's reign. Muhammad now endeavoured to curb these amirs by reducing over-mighty subjects and diverting energies into the holy wars in Syria. But like all preceding sultans, he had to deal first of all with rival claims from members of his own dynasty. In 499/1105-6 Mengii-Bars b. Bori-Bars rebelled at Nihavand. He tried to draw the sons of Bursuq to his side, but the sultan captured and jailed him together with other potential claimants, the sons of Tekish. In the following year Qilich-Arslan b. Sulaiman, who had been fighting the Franks at Edessa, came to Mosul at the invitation of Zangi b. Chokermish, established himself there, and claimed the sultanate for himself; eventually defeated by Muhammad's general Chavli, and knowing himself to be a rebel who could expect only short shrift from the sultan, Sulaiman drowned himself to avoid capture.2

It was a measure of Muhammad's sense of strength that in 501/1108 he decided to overthrow the Mazyadid Saif al-Daula Sadaqa. During the fighting between Berk-Yaruq and Muhammad, the so-called " King of the Arabs" had usually lent his support to the latter, but neither side had had a preponderance in central Iraq and the rivalry of the two Saljuqs had probably been helpful to Mazyadid interests. A t first Sadaqa continued in high favour. Deputed to recover Basra, he and Muhadhdhib al-Daula of the Banu Abi'l-Jabr expelled from there a Turkish amir who had installed himself during the previous disturbances, and the city was now restored to Saljuq control. Then in 498/1105 he received the grant of Wasit.1 But slanders about Sadaqa seem to have been spread at the Saljuq court by the "Amid Abu Ja'far al-Balkhi: he was even accused of Isma'ill inclinations, possibly because of his strongly Shi'i beliefs. Yet the sources unite in stressing how Sadaqa embodied the tradi tional Arab virtues of liberality and hospitality. His house in Baghdad was "the inviolate refuge of all those in fear" (Ibn al-Jauzi), and "in his reign, Hilla was the halting-place of the traveller, the refuge of the hopeful ones, the asylum of the outcast, and the sanctuary of the terri fied fugitive" (Ibn al-Tiqtaqa). Indeed, it was his sheltering of the refugee Dailami governor of Aveh and Saveh which gave the sultan a pretext to move against him; before this Sadaqa had behaved very circumspectly, refusing in 500/1107 to go to the aid of Zangi b. Chokermish in Mosul lest the sultan be offended. In a battle in the marshlands of al-Zacfaraniyya, Sadaqa's Arabs and Kurds were de feated by Muhammad's forces, amongst whom were the sons of Bursuq and the Kakuyid Abu Kalijar Garshasp; the sultan's palace ghulams and Turkish archers played a prominent part in decimating Sadaqa's front-line troops, and Sadaqa himself was killed. It was not Muham mad's aim to occupy the Mazyadid capital of Hilla; he contented him self with carrying off Sadaqa's son Dubais and even appointed Sadaqa's old commander-in-chief as governor of the city.2 For several years al-Jazireh and Mosul had been disputed among various local amirs. The region was strategically important as a frontier march against the Turkmen elements in Diyarbakr and

Armenia, many of whom were grouped around the Artuqid ruler of Nisibin, Il-Ghazi, and around Sukman al-Qutbi of Akhlat; it was also a frontier against the Crusaders, who were pressing eastwards from Edessa. Furthermore, in these years Ridwan of Aleppo was trying to bring Mosul into his own sphere of influence and thereby utilize its resources for his wars against the Franks. Muhammad tried to stabilize the position by the direct appointment of successive ghulam governors in Mosul: Chavli Saqao, Maudud b. Altun-Tegin, Aq-Sonqur alBursuqi, and Ai-Aba Juyush (PChavush) Beg, the last two being made atabegs to his son Mas'ud. He hoped, too, to use these amirs and their troops against the Franks in Syria. His relations with the spiritual head of Sunni Islam, the cAbbasid caliph, were cordial, and in 502/1108-9 a marriage was arranged between al-Mustazhir and Muhammad's sister, the daughter of Malik-Shah.1 Appeals for help against the Franks came from the hard-pressed people of Aleppo and even from the Byzantine Emperor Alexis Comnenus. From 501/1107-8 onwards, Fakhr al-Mulk Ibn 'Ammar, the dispossessed ruler of Tripoli, haunted the Saljuq court, until Muhammad was moved to send troops and money to his cousin Duqaq of Damascus for the relief of Tripoli.2 Chavli, Maudud, Aq-Sonqur, and Bursuq b. Bursuq all campaigned in Syria with little success, mainly because of the coolness of Il-Ghazi and of Tugh-Tegin of Damascus, who in 509/1115 allied with the Franks. The crushing victory of the Crusaders at Danith in that year, coupled with the death of the Saljuq rulers in Syria, put an end to Muhammad's hopes of intervening in Syria. Little is mentioned of internal conditions in western and central Iran during Muhammad's reign, apart from the continuing activities of the Isma'Ilis. On the north-western frontier an attack on Ganja by the Georgians was repelled (503/1109-10).3 After the suppression of MenguBars' revolt in Jibal, the sultan took the opportunity of exchanging the iqta's held by Bursuq's sons in Khuzistan for others in the region of Dinavar, presumably to reduce the concentration of their power in the south-west.4 Fars was governed by Fakhr al-Daula Chavli Saqao from 498/1104 to 500/1106, and then again from 502/1109 till his death eight years later. According to Ibn al-Athir's account, Chavli ruled oppressively, using Muhammad's infant son Chaghri, for whom he

was atabeg, as a cloak for his tyrannies and expropriations. O n the other hand Ibn al-Balkhi, Chavli's contemporary and the local historian of Fars, mentions several measures taken by the atabeg to restore order and prosperity. The chief obstacle to order in Fars remained the Shabankara'Is, and Chavli began systematically to reduce their castles, capturing over seventy of them and dismantling the fortifications of most of them. Campaigns were also launched against the tribal chiefs of the Kurds, such as Hasan b. al-Mubariz of Fasa and A b u Sa'd b. Muhammad b. Masa of the Karzuvi tribe. The chief of Darabjird, Ibrahim, was expelled and forced to flee to Kirman, where his kinsman by marriage, the Saljuq ruler of Kirman, sheltered him. Chavli accord ingly marched against Kirman in 508/1114-15 to demand the extra dition of the Shabankara'Is who had fled there, but he was unable to get beyond a point on the frontier between Fars and Kirman.1 However, Chavli had many positive achievements in Fars to his credit: the rebuilding of towns, the restoration of agriculture, and in particular the repair of irrigation works and dams, such as the Band-i Qassar in the district of Lower Kurbal and the dam in the district of Ramjird, which was named " Fakhristan " in his honour. On the whole, Muham mad's reign witnessed a distinct improvement in the pacification of Fars; the sultan himself conciliated the tribal chieftains and kept a group of Shabankara'i leaders permanently in his service at court.2 Kirman was ruled from 495/1101 to 537/1142 by Muhiyy al-Islam Arslan-Shah b. Kirman Shah. Although he ruled longer than any other Saljuqs of Kirman, Muhammad b. Ibrahim has very little to say about his reign, presumably because it was in general peaceful and uneventful. He does mention Arslan-Shah's encouragement of the ulema and scholars, and states that in his reign Kirman reached new heights of commercial prosperity; chaos and piracy in the Persian Gulf meant that much trade was coming overland, and the trading suburb of the capital expanded greatly. The continued existence of this compact Saljuq amirate in eastern central Iran, with its permanent force of Turkmen soldiery, made it a haven for political refugees and for those seeking military help; it was during this period that Kirman sheltered the Ghaznavid Bahram-Shah b. Mas'ud III. Arslan-Shah also inter vened at Yazd on behalf of the last members of the KakQyid family,

who held their fiefs there, and afterwards he received this town from one of the Kakuyid disputants. Keeping up links with the Great Saljuqs, Arslan-Shah married one of Sultan Muhammad's daughters, and was careful not to infringe on the rights of San jar in Khurasan. Thus whilst welcoming Bahram-Shah, he refused to give him military help, referring him to Sanjar as the senior representative of the Saljuqs in eastern Iran; it was in fact with Sanjar's help that BahramShah was placed on the throne at Ghazna in 510/1117 (see below, pp. 15 8-9).1 The freedom from external pressure left Muhammad free to tackle the question of the Isma'ills with some success, although he never permanently quelled them. The political assassinations carried out by the Batini fida'is created an unpleasant atmosphere of suspicion and fear within the sultanate, while the denunciation of " heretics " is a common feature of Muhammad's reign. In 500/1107 Vizier Sa'd al-Mulk Abu'lMahasin was denounced by one of his enemies and executed, together with many of the Divan officials;2 fifteen years later, under Mahmud b. Muhammad, the celebrated poet and stylist al-Tughra'i was executed on a trumped-up charge of heresy (see pp. 15 8-9 below). Under the influence of the ra'is of Isfahan, 'Abdallah al-Khatibi, Muhammad purged the administration of many allegedly Isma'Ili sympathizers, and started a policy of favouring Khurasanis at the expense of " "Iraqis " (i.e. those from western Iran or "Iraq 'Ajami), on the plea that the Khurasanis were stronger supporters of orthodoxy.3 Amongst the military operations' against the Batiniyya, the capture of Shahdiz near Isfahan and that of Khanlanjan in 500/1107 brought the sultan much prestige; despite the fact that some of the defenders escaped to Kuhistan and to other fortresses in Fars, Ahmad b. 'Abd al-Malik b. 'Attash and his son were both killed.4 Alamut, the seat of Hasan-i Sabbah, was besieged either in 501/1107-8 or two years later by Vizier Diya' al-Mulk and Amir Chavli; it was the vizier's failure here which led to his downfall. In 505/1111-12 the sultan sent the governor of Aveh and Saveh, Anush-Tegin Shirgir (?b. Shirgir), who captured various castles in the region of Qazvin and Dailam. Towards

IX. T H E SALJUQ S U L T A N A T E IN T H E WEST UNDER T H E SONS OF M U H A M M A D B. M A L I K - S H A H
Muhammad died in 511/1118 and in his last illness he appointed his son Mahmud as successor. Mahmud reigned for fourteen years (511-25/ i n 8-31) with the honorific Mughith al-Dunyd wcfl-Din (" Bringer of Help in Secular and Religious Affairs"). But there were four other sons, Mas'ud, Toghril, Sulaiman Shah, and Saljuq Shah, who at various times and in various parts of the empire also held power. Indeed, Muham mad's sons held the sultanate in the west for the next three or four decades, and all but Saljuq Shah reigned in turn.2 The centrifugal tendencies of the previous two reigns, held in check for a time by Muhammad, now had free play. The succession in western Iran and Iraq was permanently in dispute, often with as many as three or four claimants at one time, each backed by his atabeg or guardian. The sultans had to find support amongst the powerful Turkish amirs, and this usually meant the alienation of territory and of fiscal rights in the form of iqta's, as well as the interference of amirs even within the sultans' own bureaucracy. Anushirvan b. Khalid, who was Mahmud's vizier in 521/1127 and 522/1128 and thus had first-hand experience of affairs, laments the decline of the Saljuq state after Muhammad's death: " In Muhammad's reign", he says, "the kingdom was united and secure from all attacks; but when it passed to his son Mahmud, they split up that unity and destroyed its cohesion. They claimed a share with him in the power, and left him only a bare subsistence."3 In the east Mahmud's uncle, Sanjar, remained the senior member of the dynasty. Although it had become the practice for the supreme sultanate to devolve on the ruler of western Iran and Iraq, Sanjar's

seniority gave him a special standing under Turkish customary law. This seems to be reflected in his decision to assume his father MalikShah's old title Mu'i^Z al-Dunyd wa'l-Din (" Strengthener in Secular and Religious Affairs") as soon as Muhammad had died; and on coins minted by Mahmud in the west, Sanjar's name is accorded primacy over his own. Whenever there was doubt over the succession in the west, it was to Sanjar that the problem was taken; on Mahmud's death in 525/1131, the Caliph al-Mustarshid refused to interfere personally, but referred the claimants Mas'ud b. Muhammad and Da'ud b. Mah mud to Sanjar, who in fact decided in favour of Toghril.1 The later years of Sanjar's rule in the east were clouded by external threats and internal unrest among the Ghuzz tribesmen, but in the earlier period his territories enjoyed relative peace, and this contrasted notably with the instability and confusion of the west, where the atabegs and other amirs had secured much of the substance of power. A t the outset of his reign, in 513/1119, Mahmud had to face an invasion of his lands by Sanjar, who alleged that the Chief Hajib 'Ali Bar had secured an objectionable ascendancy over the young ruler, and that Mahmud was encouraging the Qarakhanids to attack him from behind. He came with a powerful army, whose commanders were said to include five kings: Sanjar, the rulers of Ghazna and Sistan, the Khwarazm-Shah Qutb al-Din Muhammad, and the Kakuyid 'Ala' al-Daula Garshasp, Isma'ilis and pagan Turks were among its troops, and there were forty elephants.2 Sanjar defeated Mahmud at Saveh, and pushed on through Jibal as far as Baghdad. When peace and amity were finally restored, Mahmud was given one of Sanjar's daughters in marriage and was made his uncle's heir, but he in turn had to relinquish important territories in the north of Iran. Sanjar remained in occupa tion of Tabaristan, Qumis, Damavand, and, most important of all, Ray, which was to serve as a kind of watchtower over western Iran. Nor did Mahmud have much direct control over the north-western provinces. His brother Toghril had received from Sultan Muhammad the iqta's of Saveh, Aveh, and Zanjan, with Amir Shirgir designated as his atabeg. A t the instigation of a new atabeg, Kiin-Toghdi, Toghril had rebelled against Mahmud, and although the rebels were forced to withdraw to Ganja, they strengthened their position through Sanjar's

Diktat to Mahmud. They further obtained Gilan and Dailam, in addition to Qazvin and several towns of the north-west, and from this base Toghril successfully defied Mahmud for the whole of the latter's reign.1 Mas'ud b. Muhammad was malik of Mosul, al-Jazireh, and Azarbaijan, and Ai-Aba Juyush Beg was his atabeg. Ample support for Mas'ud's ambitions came from the troops of local Turkmen and Kurdish chiefsespecially from 'Imad al-Din Zangi, the son of Malik-Shah's ghulam commander Qasim al-Daula Aq-Sonqur. Moreover, the Mazyadid Dubais b. Sadaqa was eager to see Mahmud and Mas'ud embroiled in warfare. According to Ibn al-Jauzi, "Saif al-Daula [Dubais] rejoiced at the conflict between the two sultans and believed that he and his power would be preserved as long as they were involved together, just as his father Sadaqa's position had been favoured by the hostility of the two sultans [Berk-Yaruq and Muhammad]".2 Mas'ud and Juyush Beg rebelled openly in 514/1120, but Mahmud's general AqSonqur Bursuqi defeated them at Asadabad. Only Mas'ud's vizier Hasan b. 'AH al-Tughra'i lost his life; Mas'ud himself was pardoned and Juyush Beg conciliated. T w o years later Juyush Beg was deputed to suppress a revolt in Azarbaijan led by Toghril and his new atabeg Aq-Sonqur Ahmadili, muqta' ofMaragheh. Dubais, however, was forced to flee to his wife's relatives, the Artuqids of Mardin, and then to the safety of the inaccessible marshes in the Batiha of southern Iraq. Mosul was granted to Aq-Sonqur Bursuqi, and in Diyarbakr the death of Il-Ghazi b. Artuq caused a split in the Artuqid family and a division of their territories which for the moment neutralized this quarter for the sultan.3
Dissension within the Saljuq family allowed the 'Abbasid caliphs to increase their secular power in the course of the 6th/12th century. This process is discernible under the capable caliphs al-Mustarshid (512-29/ i n 8 - 3 5 ) and al-Muqtafi (530-5 5/1136-60), and it becomes particularly marked in the long and successful reign of al-Nasir (575-622/11801225).4 During Mahmud's reign the hostility of the Shi'I Mazyadids

prevented al-Mustarshid from ever alienating the Saljuqs too much. Indeed, Ibn al-Athir says that the sultans left Dubais in power merely as a check on the caliph; when al-Mustarshid died and Dubais's role here was finished, Mas'ud executed him.1 O n one occasion the caliph had to implore Mahmud to remain in the capital as a safeguard against Dubais, who had sworn to raze Baghdad to the ground. In 516/1122 al-Mustarshid was obliged to accept as his vizier the brother of Mahmud's own vizier, Shams al-Mulk 'Uthman b. Nizam al-Mulk, and when the latter was executed in 518/1124 al-Mustarshid had to remove the brother from office correspondingly. However, in company with Aq-Sonqur Bursuqi the caliph defended Baghdad against Dubais and in 517/1125 took the field personally against him; this act, together with his seizure and destruction of wine in the sultan's market at Baghdad in 514/1120, signified his growing self-confidence. The sultan's shahna in Baghdad, Sa'd al-Daula Yurun-Qush, was perturbed enough in 510/1126 to warn Mahmud of the caliph's rising confidence and military expertise, and he foresaw an attack on the sultan's rights in Iraq if the latter did not come personally to enforce them. Mahmud did come to Baghdad and besiege al-Mustarshid in the eastern part of the city, forcing him to make peace and hand over the stipulated tribute.2 Dubais joined with Toghril in 519/1125 to harass the sultan and caliph in Iraq; but they were unable to remain there, and Mahmud pursued them through Jibal into Khurasan, where they took refuge with Sanjar. They then aroused Sanjar with stories of Mahmud's disaffection and his closeness to the caliph, causing Sanjar to come westwards to Ray in 522/1128. But the two sultans were reconciled there, and Dubais was forced to flee to Hilla, Basra, and finally Syria, where he fell into the hands of Zangi and narrowly escaped death. T w o years later Mas'ud came to Saveh from Khurasan, where he had been staying with Sanjar; it was feared that the latter was instigating him to rebel, but the two brothers made peace at Kirmanshah, and Mahmud granted to Mas'ud the iqta' of Ganja.3 Being so pre-occupied with internal difficulties, Mahmud could give

only intermittent attention to the external frontiers of his part of the empire. During his reign the main danger zone was in the north-west, Arran and the Caucasus, where the Georgians became very active under "The Restorer", David IV (1089-1125). He not only brought into Georgia large bands of slave troops and Qipchaq mercenaries, but he ceased the payment of tribute to the Saljuqs and interfered with the seasonal migrations of the Turkmen into Georgia. Mahmud sent an expedition against him in 515/1121 in which the Artuqid Il-Ghazi, Toghril, Dubais, and Kun-Toghdi took part, but the Muslim army was destroyed and the triumphant Georgians entered Tiflis, dislodging the local Muslim family of the Banu Ja'far. It was probably in 517/1123, shortly after the fall of Tiflis, that David scored a further success by entering Ani without striking a blow. There he deposed the Shaddadid amir Abu'l-Asvar II b. Manuchihr (? 503-17/? 1110-23), restored the Armenian cathedral to its Christian usage, and installed in Ani an Armenian governor. This governor was later threatened by a Saljuq army under Sanjar, probably in 520/1126, and returned the city to Fadl III b. Abu'l-Asvar II (reigned c. 520-4/r. 1126-30). Georgian expansion eastwards to Shamakhi and Darband also affected the Muslim principality of Shirvan, and in 517/1123 Mahmud came to this province. He seized the Shirvan Shah (possibly Manuchihr II b. Faridun) and behaved so repressively that Shirvan's annual tribute to the Saljuq treasury now dried up; in the end, a threatened attack by David the Restorer compelled the sultan to withdraw.1 Ibn al-Athir alleges that in the course of an expedition in 524/1130, just before his death, Mahmud captured the Isma'ili stronghold of Alamut; but the verdict of another source, that the sultan achieved no successes here, is probably nearer the truth.2 In judging Mahmud as a ruler, the sources praise his justice and clemency and also his excellence as an Arabic scholar, saying that he attained a level of literacy not common among the Saljuqs.3 Conversely, Anushirvan b. Khalid assesses his conduct of administration severely. He lists ten great faults of his reign, including the alienation of Sanjar

and Dubais, the dispersal of royal ghulams, a moral deterioration at court, and the squandering of the treasure amassed by his father. Much obloquy is heaped on his viziers, such as the tyrannical Shams al-Mulk 'Uthman, but above all on Qiwam al-Din Abu'l-Qasim al-DarguzIni, or al-Ansabadhi, who acted as 'Arid al-Jaish and then as vizier for Mahmud; on his dismissal he acted as vizier for Toghril in Azarbaijan, again achieving a reputation for tyranny, till in 527/1133 Toghril executed him. Anushirvan sneers at his peasant origin; he also accuses him of friendliness towards the Batiniyya, of using his official position to get rid of enemies, and of financial rapacity.1 Y e t it must be remem bered that the sultan's financial position was usually parlous. His direct rule extended only to Jibal, northern Fars, and the Baghdad area, with a summer capital in Hamadan and a winter one in Baghdad, and from these regions he had to find iqta's for the soldiers directly in his employ. Because of financial problems, the sphere of operations of his divans was drastically reduced, and the vizier was compelled to get money by seizures and confiscations. One vizier, Kamal al-Mulk 'AH al-Simirumi, earned great unpopularity in 514/1120 by reimposing the local tolls and market taxes (mukus) which had been abolished thirteen years previously by Sultan Muhammad.2 Accordingly, it is not sur prising that Mahmud got through the greater part of the treasure chest—it contained eighteen million dinars in cash alone—which his father had assembled.3
A further period of crisis and chaos occurred in 525/1131 when Mahmud died. At Hamadan his young son Da'ud was proclaimed sultan by al-Darguzini, with Aq-Sonqur Ahmadili assuming the office of atabeg. Da'ud was recognized in Jibal and Azarbaijan, but in Iraq Mas'ud proclaimed himself sultan, and in Fars and Khuzistan another brother, Saljuq-Shah, supported by the Atabeg Qaracha, also claimed the throne. The caliph referred the disputants to Sanjar, as senior member of the dynasty, but Sanjar's intervention only brought into the arena his own protege, Toghril, whose claim he now pushed. Sanjar came to Jibal in person and set Toghril on the throne, giving him al-Darguzini as his vizier; he also invited Dubais b. Sadaqa and Zangi to invade Iraq and embarrass Mas'ud's ally the caliph. Complex military operations followed, but Sanjar's withdrawal to Transoxiana,

where a Qarakhanid revolt had broken out, left Toghril in a very shaky position (see below, p. 139). He could find no popular sup port in Jibal, where the people of Isfahan refused to admit him to their city, and after being twice defeated by Mas'ud, he fled to Ray and then to Tabaristan, where the Bavandid Ispahbadh 'Ala' al-Daula 'All b. Shahriyar (511-34/1117-40) sheltered him during the winter of 527/1132-3. Mas'ud's involvement with Da'ud, who was holding out in Azarbaljan, permitted Toghril to gather together an army and make a successful revanche, Mas'ud was driven from Hamadan and fled to Baghdad in a wretched state. When at last Toghril seemed secure on the throne, he fell ill at Hamadan; and at the beginning of 529/1134, after a troubled reign of only two years, he died.1 A race for the throne occurred when the news spread of Toghril's end. Mas'ud was in Baghdad, but he managed to clear a way through the mountain snows, using camels to trample a road; he was received in Hamadan by the amirs and proclaimed sultan with the honorific Ghiyath al-Dunjd weft-Din. In this fashion he began a reign of nearly twenty years (529-47/1134-52), the longest of any sultan in the west since Malik-Shah's time. He employed as his vizier Anushirvan b. Khalid and entrusted to his tutelage his brother Da'ud b. Muhammad.2 As in Mahmxid's time, the sultan's authority was in practice confined to Jibal and central Iraq. When Mas'ud obtained the throne, the rival claimant Da'ud b. Mahmud, who had been cheated of the succession on his father's death two years before, remained in Azarbaljan, and over the following years he made several attempts from this base to seize the sultanate. Eventually conciliated by Mas'ud's recognition of him as the vali 'ahd, he now married one of the sultan's daughters and settled down at Tabriz, but in 538/1143-4 he was assassinated by the Isma'ilis, allegedly at the instigation of Zangi, who feared that Mas'ud was about to send Da'ud to take control of his own region of northern Syria.3 In the later years of Mas'ud's reign the north-west passed into the hands of a series of powerful Turkish amirs who behaved as virtually independent rulers.

1 1 4 0 - 1 , Chavli Jandar took over in Azarbaijan, Arran, and Armenia, finally becoming the atabeg to Mas'ud's son Malik-Shah.1 Chavli's own death occurred in 541/1146, after which 'Abd al-Rahman ToghanYurek succeeded him as atabeg to the young prince and added the governorship of Arran and Azarbaijan to his existing iqtac of Khalkhal; but in 541/1147, alarmed at Toghan-Yiirek's power, the sultan procured his murder (see p. 132 below).2 Nevertheless, the end of Mas'ud's sultan ate saw power in Azarbaijan being monopolized by two Turkish amirs, Shams al-Din Eldigiiz, the atabeg of Arslan b. Toghril, and A q Sonqur (or Arslan) b. Aq-Sonqur Ahmadili of Maragheh. Fars was for many years ruled by the Amir Boz-Aba, the irreconcil able enemy of Sultan Mas'ud ever since 531/1136-7, when the sultan had killed Boz-Aba's companion, the atabeg Mengu-Bars. Boz-Aba maintained himself in Fars till Mas'ud captured him in battle and executed him (542/1147-8).3 In the years before this violent end, the amir had successfully fought off attempts by other amirs to oust him from possession of Fars, in favour of the princes for whom they were atabegs. Thus in 533/1138-9 the atabeg Qara-Sonqur, together with Da'ud and Saljuq-Shah, the sons of Sultan Muhammad, had invaded Fars and placed Saljuq-Shah on the throne at Shiraz as local malik; but once Qara-Sonqur had departed, Boz-Aba came back, seized Saljuq-Shah, and jailed him. A t the end of his life Boz-Aba espoused the cause of two of Mahmud's sons, Muhammad and MalikShah, and for a brief moment before his final downfall placed them on the throne in Jibal (see below, p. 131).4 With regard to Saljuq influence in Iraq and al-Jazireh, the most significant event in Mas'ud's reign was the meteoric rise of 'Imad al-Din Zangi b. Aq-Sonqur, a Turkish amir of slave origin. Zangi's sphere of expansion was essentially that of the Arab lands in al-Jazireh, Diyarbakr, and northern Syria, but the possession of Mosul gave him an important base for penetration northwards and eastwards into Kurdistan, and on several occasions he allied with the discontented Turkish amirs in Iran against the sultan and caliph. Indeed, Mas'ud, came to regard him as the arch-instigator of the rebellious coalitions which encompassed him. A s governor of Wasit and Basra in Sultan Mahmud's time, Zangi had successfully administered the difficult and confused delta region of Iraq, and in 521/1127, with the death of the

governor of Mosul, 'Izz al-Din Mascud al-Bursuqi, Mahmud appointed Zangi in his stead; he also gave him the custody of his sons Alp-Arslan and Farrukh-Shah, so that Zangi now became an atabeg.1 From Mosul, Zangi began a policy of conquest against the Arab and Turkmen rulers of Diyarbakr and northern Syria, as well as against the Franks and Byzantines. First he captured Aleppo, Hims, and Hama, and then in 539/1144 he achieved the success which made him the idol of Sunni historians, the capture of Edessa from Count Jocelyn II. His death came in 541/1146 at the hands of his own ghulams whilst he was besieging the 'Uqailid Salim b. Malik in Qalat Ja'bar.2 Although his exploits had made him a Sunni hero, Zangi was always hostile to the cAbbasids. In Mas'ud's reign he allied with the Shi'I Mazyadids and with the deposed Caliph al-Rashid against the Caliph al-Muqtafi of Baghdad; and in 528/1134, during Toghril's reign, his extensive operations in the Hakkari region of Kurdistan and Armenia were provoked by the Kurdish chiefs' help to al-Mustarshid, given in the previous year when the caliph had besieged Zangi in Mosul and expelled him from it.3 At the close of the year in which Mas'ud was acknowledged sultan (529/1135), Caliph al-Mustarshid was assassinated by a Batini, thus ending a reign full of military and political activity. His son al-Rashid reigned only for one year (529-30/1135-6), and his deposition at Mas'ud's instigation marks the high tide of Saljuq influence in Baghdad at this time. The new caliph, al-Muqtafi b. al-Mustazhir (530-5 5/ 1136-60), proved to be a capable and energetic warrior as well as a religious figurehead. Receiving at the outset of his reign the revenues which his father had held, he began to build up a personal army of Armenian and Greek ghulams, excluding Turks because he found them unreliable.4 He strengthened the wall which al-Mustarshid and his vizier Abu Nasr Ahmad b. Nizam al-Mulk had built round Baghdad in 517/1123, and he also dug a trench around the city.5 He was there fore able on several occasions to defy the sultans, and when Mas'ud died and a period of even greater disunity within the Saljuq dynasty ensued, he extended caliphal authority over the whole of lower and

central Iraq to a degree unknown since the early 4th/ioth century. As Ibn al-Tiqtaqa says: " In his reign there occurred much civil strife and warfare between him and the Sultan of Persia, in which the victory lay with him; his reign was also characterized by much activity on the part of 'ayyars and evil-doers [the sources stress the sharp rise of 'iyara, i.e. brigandage and mob violence, in the capital at this time], for the suppression of which he took firm steps."1 In the early months of Mas'ud's sultanate, relations with al-Mustarshid deteriorated rapidly. The caliph prepared for war, helped by some Turkish amirs who had deserted Mas'ud, and also by Bursuq b. Bursuq of Khuzistan, who linked up with him in Jibal; whilst Da'ud in Azarbaljan arranged to join forces with the caliph at Dinavar. Nevertheless, Mas'ud coped easily with this coalition. In a battle at Dai-Marg near Hamadan, which was really little more than a skirmish, the caliph's Turkish troops deserted to the Saljuq army. The caliph himself was taken prisoner, and shortly afterwards was murdered by Isma'Ilis in the sultan's camp at Maragheh, whither Mas'ud had gone in pursuit of Da'ud. Mas'ud confiscated al-Mustarshid's estates and property in Baghdad and is said to have looted ten million dinars worth of goods, the chests of coin alone requiring one hundred and seventy mules to carry them away. From Khurasan, Sanjar had written en joining Mas'ud to treat the caliph with respect, although according to 'Imad al-Din, contemporaries whispered that Sanjar himself was really behind al-Mustarshid's assassination.2 The new caliph al-Rashid was quickly involved in hostilities with Mas'ud over the non-payment of a tribute customarily due to the sultan. Barring Mas'ud's representative Yurun-Qush from Baghdad, he formed a grand coalition against the sultan, embracing Da'ud from Azarbaljan, Zangi from Mosul, Sadaqa b. Dubais, and his "atabeg" 'Antara b. Abi'l-'Askar (the appearance of this typically Turkish office amongst a purely Arab dynasty is interesting), together with Bursuq b. Bursuq, the son of Aq-Sonqur Ahmadili, and the Turkish governors of Qazvin and Isfahan. In the extreme south Mas'ud's brother SaljuqShah came from Khuzistan and seized Wasit. But Mas'ud remained master of events. He captured Baghdad, and the caliph fled with

ZangI to Mosul. Mas'ud now assembled the religious dignitaries of the capital and pointed out how al-Rashid had broken his vow of allegiance and his promise never to take up arms against the sultan. Al-Rashid's financial requisitions for his soldiers had made him un popular; a fatwa, or judicial opinion, was secured for his deposition, and his uncle set up as al-Muqtafi (530/1136).1 This triumph was the peak of Mascud's career. His general Qara-Sonqur followed it up by routing Da'ud at Maragheh; Saljuq-Shah's position in KhQzistan became unsafe and he actually had to appeal to Mas'ud for assistance. The sultan obtained the loyalty of Sadaqa by marrying the latter's daughter, and he also appointed Sadaqa's brother Muhammad to govern Hilla, while the new caliph married Mas'ud's sister Fatima.2 There still remained the threat from Malik Da'ud and the ex-caliph al-Rashid, who gathered round themselves in Azarbaijan a group of amirs fearful of a rise in the sultan's power. Al-Rashid had already appealed to Sanjar for help against Mas'ud, but Sanjar's preoccupations with Transoxianan affairs compelled him to refuse.3 Mas'ud defeated and killed the chief of these rebellious amirs, Mengu-Bars, governor of Fars, but he was in turn defeated by Amir Toghan-Yurek, who captured and killed the Mazyadid Sadaqa and the sons of Qara-Sonqur, the atabeg of Azarbaijan. From the south Saljuq-Shah made an attempt on Baghdad. Al-Rashid, Da'ud, and Boz-Aba established themselves in the Saljuq capital Hamadan; but al-Rashid was unable to make any further headway, and a group of his Khurasanian soldiers, possibly having Isma'ili sympathies, murdered him at Isfahan in 5 32/1137-8.4 Da'ud seems now to have despaired of achieving the sultanate for himself, and to have settled for a limited sphere of authority in Azar baijan, where for the remaining six years of his life he was governor under the Atabeg Ayaz. T o Saljuq-Shah, Mas'ud allotted the governor ship of Akhlat, Malazgird, and Arzan in eastern Anatolia, all the former territories of the Shah-Armanid Nasir al-Din Sukman II; and the amir of Tabriz, Qiz-Oghlu (?Ghuzz-Oghlu), led an expedition thither to take up possession.5 In the next year, 533/1138—9, seeking

revenge on Boz-Aba for the killing of his son, Qara-Sonqur took with him both Da'ud and Saljuq-Shah (the latter having been recalled from Akhlat) on an expedition to Fars. Saljuq-Shah was placed on the throne as malik of Fars, but in the following year he was deposed by Boz-Aba, thenceforth disappearing from history and probably dying in captivity. Thus Fars and Khuzistan remained in the hands of BozAba.1 In 535/1140-1 Mas'ud sent two generals against him, Isma'Il Chahardangi and Alp-Qush Khun-Kar, but they were unable to collect sufficient funds in Iraq for the expedition, and after some futile opera tions in the Batiha it was abandoned.2 Shortly before this expedition, Qara-Sonqur had had to deal with a descent of the Georgians on Ganja. During Mahmud's reign Ganja had been recaptured for a while by one of its ancestral Shaddadid rulers, Fadl III b. Abi'l-Asvar II, but soon afterwards it fell under the power of a Turkish amir, Toghan-Arslan al-Ahdab (" the hump backed"), ruler of Bitlis and Arzan, whose son Qurti was probably responsible for Fadl's death in 524/1130. The Georgian attack was led by a noble of the Orbeliani family, Ivane b. Abi Laith; it came on top of a serious earthquake at Ganja and caused great loss of life and property, but was repulsed by Qara-Sonqur when he arrived in Arran.3 In the middle years of his reign, Mas'ud fell more and more under the influence of the Turkish amirs. Their ability to dictate to the sultan, even in matters concerning the central bureaucracy, was clearly shown in 533/1139 when they secured the dismissal and death of Mas'ud's vizier. Mas'ud had found his first vizier, Anushirvan b. Khalid, too mild and lenient; his second one, al-Darguzini, a relative of the vizier to Mahmud and Toghril, was useless and incompetent, so in 533/1139 Mas'ud appointed to the vizierate his treasurer, Kamal al-Din Muham mad. Distinguished for his equity and probity Kamal al-Din abolished vexatious taxes and investigated complaints of tyranny. He was zealous in asserting the sultan's financial rights, and uncovered thefts and embezzlements. Not surprisingly he made many enemies, so that Qara-Sonqur threatened a refusal to march against Fars and a with drawal of allegiance in favour of one of the Saljuq claimants if the overzealous vizier were not removed; Mas'ud was obliged to agree to this and to appoint Qara-Sonqur's personal vizier as his own chief minister.

After this, says Ibn al-Athir, "Things became difficult for Sultan Mas'ud. He was impotent to prevent the amirs from parcelling out the whole land as iqta's for themselves, so that in the end he had no territory left at all for himself, but merely the name of Sultan."1 Qara-Sonqur died at Ardabil in 535/1140-1, much mourned by the people of Azarbaijan. When he was dying, he named the Amir Chavli Jandar as his successor in Azarbaijan and Arran, and Mas'ud had to agree to this. In Ray, the Amir 'Abbas—he was a slave of Jauhar, Sanjar's former governor there—consolidated his power. He collected round himself a large slave guard and soon acquired a reputation as a hammer of the Isma'Ilis in the Alburz area, who had killed his master Jauhar; and on one occasion he led an expedition against Alamut.2 A t the sultan's court, the loyalty of the Chief Hajib 'Abd alRahman Toghan-Yurek was a dubious quantity, in part because of jealousy of Mas'ud's favourite, Khass Beg Arslan b. Palang-Eri. In his struggle against the disaffected amirs centred round 'Abbas of Ray, Toghan-Yurek, and Boz-Aba of Fars, Mas'ud could generally count upon the support of the two leading figures in Azarbaijan, Chavli (until his death in 541/1146), and Eldigiiz, who was atabeg to Arslan b. Toghril and for a time had been Mas'ud's shahna in Baghdad. The sultan resolved to bring 'Abbas to heel and came to Ray with an army, but he was bought off by rich presents from the amir. A series of conspiratorial negotiations between 'Abbas and Boz-Aba now began, culminating in 540/1145-6 in a definite rebellion. Boz-Aba brought to Isfahan and Hamadan the two princes Muhammad and Malik-Shah, sons of Sultan Mahmud, while the sultan left Baghdad for Kirmanshah, and was joined by Eldigiiz and other amirs of Azarbaijan whose assistance he had invoked. 'Abbas marched from Ray with yet another Saljuq prince, Mas'ud's brother Sulaiman-Shah. Meanwhile, the sultan had pushed on to Maragheh, where he was joined by Chavli. A battle near Kashan was imminent, but Sulaiman-Shah and 'Abbas withdrew towards Ray and then to Ardahan, pursued by Mas'ud. Boz-Aba was compelled by these desertions to fall back on Isfahan with the two Saljuq maliks; from there, with Chavli in pursuit, he escaped to Fars. Despite this apparent success, Mas'ud's position was far from strong; the loyalty of his Chief Hajib, Toghan-Yurek, was

uncertain, for it was believed that his sympathies inclined towards the rebels. The sultan made peace with 'Abbas and received the custody of Sulaiman-Shah, who was now consigned to imprisonment. When Chavli died, Toghan-Yiirek received what he had long coveted, the governorship of Arran and Azarbaijan, and at the same time he was made atabeg to Mas'ud's son Malik-Shah. Moreover the sultan was compelled to accept as his own vizier the personal vizier of Boz-Aba, Taj al-Dln Ibn Darust, and Toghan-Yiirek directed all his efforts towards bringing Boz-Aba back into favour at court.1 In the west the spectacular successes of Zangi were continuing, and from his Mosul base he was gradually mopping up the remaining independent amirs of al-Jazireh and Diyarbakr, while also making war on the Kurdish chiefs of the Hakkari region. Zangi had in his care a Saljuq prince, Sultan Mahmud's son Alp-Arslan, and was waiting to place this candidate on the throne as soon as Mas'ud should die. In 538/1143-4 Mas'ud prepared a punitive expedition against Zangi, regarding him as a source of persistent rebelliousness, but again he was bought off by the promise of a payment; even then, the sultan did not exact the whole of the sum due, hoping that he could still conciliate Zangi.2 In central Iraq Baghdad was racked by 'iyara and the Mazyadid 'Ali b. Dubais roused the local Arab population of the Hilla district and wrested the capital from his brother Muhammad. He defeated an army sent by the shahna of Baghdad, and, despite a brief occupation by Mas'ud's troops in 542/1147-8, retook Hilla and remained in possession of it.3 The death of Zangi in 541/1146 relieved the sultan of this source of worry, and in the same year he also succeeded in breaking out of the iron grip of the Turkish amirs. He procured the assassination of Toghan-Yiirek at Ganja, and that of 'Abbas, who was then deputychief hajib, at the court in Baghdad.4 In place of Toghan-Yiirek, Khass Beg Arslan b. Palang-Eri was appointed atabeg to Malik Muhammad, while the obnoxious vizier Ibn Darust was sent back to Boz-Aba in Fars. Boz-Aba, his position obviously weakened by the elimination of his two great allies, now marched to Isfahan and Hamadan, accompanied by the princes Muhammad and Malik-Shah,

whom he set up in the khutba of those two cities. Mas'ud hurried from Baghdad, summoning aid from Khass Beg, Eldigiiz, and Shirgir in the north-west, and their forces united at Hamadan before Boz-Aba was able to give battle to Mas'ud alone. There followed a fierce engage ment at Marg-i Qara-Tegin, in which the army of Fars was routed and Boz-Aba and the son of 'Abbas were killed. At the conclusion of this campaign, Mas'ud married his nephew Muhammad to his own daughter Jauhar, the widow of Da'ud b. Mahmud, granted him Khuzistan, and proclaimed him the official heir to the throne.1 The sultan's excessive favour to Khass Beg, together with fears among the remaining amirs that their fate would be similar to that of Boz-Aba and his allies, contributed to the formation of a fresh coalition of rebellious amirs in 543/1148, this time including many of Mas'ud's former supporters. Forces were sent from Arran and Azarbaijan by Eldigiiz and Qaisar; from Jibal by Alp-Qush and Tatar; from Wasit by Turuntai; from Hilla by 'AH b. Dubais. Other amirs provided further troops, and they were all joined outside Baghdad by Malik Muhammad. Mas'ud entrusted the defence of the city to the caliph, who deepened the protective trench round Baghdad and issued to the citizens a general summons to arms; the sultan himself then withdrew to the fortress of Takrit. After heavy fighting, the allies dispersed. Alp-Qush then attempted to place Malik-Shah b. Mahmud on the throne at Baghdad, but his attack on the city was repelled by alMuqtafi. Sanj ar came to Ray in the winter of 544/1149-50, a reconciliation with Mas'ud took place, and he promised to end Khass Beg's ascendancy.2 During Mas'ud's absence at Ray, several of the previous rebels, including Yurun-Qush, Turuntai, and 'All b. Dubais, again massed their troops in Iraq, this time in company with Malik-Shah. They sought the caliph's assurance that he would make the khutba for their nominee, but on Mas'ud's return to Baghdad the coalition fell apart. During the last year or so of the sultan's life Malik-Shah's pretensions remained an active threat to security until finally, when he raided Isfahan and drove off cattle from there, Mas'ud sent troops against him. Mas'ud's death came in the next year, 547/1152, at Hamadan. "With him", says Ibn al-Athir, "the fortunes of the Saljuq family

died; after him, there was no banner for them to depend on or rally round—c Qais's death was not the death of a single man, but rather the collapse of a whole tribe's foundations.'"1 All this time the local Saljuq line in Kirman obtruded little on the wider scene of events in Iran. The long and peaceful reign of ArslanShah had ended in a burst of violence in 537/1142, when, during a quarrel over the future succession, the most aggressive and capable of Arslan-Shah's sons, Muhammad, seized his father, killed him, and then imprisoned and blinded some twenty of his own brothers and nephews.2 The claims of another brother, Saljuq-Shah, were dashed in a battle outside Jiruft, and he fled across the Persian Gulf to alAhsa' and Oman. There he assembled a force with the intention of invading Kirman, but Muhammad's agents obtained his imprisonment in Oman. Thereafter, Muhammad was undisturbed on his throne; only at the end of his reign did Saljuq-Shah manage to escape and return to Kirman, where he met defeat and death at the hands of the new amir, Toghril-Shah b. Muhammad. Muhammad b. Arslan-Shah assumed the honorific Mughith alDunya wcfl-Din and reigned for fourteen years (537-51/1142-56). His prestige was such that neighbouring potentates sought his protection and help. The governor of Tabas in southern Khurasan, menaced by the Ghuzz tribesmen who got out of control towards the end of Sanjar's reign in the east, yielded up his town to Muhammad, in whose hands it remained until the rise of Sanjar's former ghulam, Mu'ayyid al-Dln Ai-Aba, in Khurasan (see below, pp. 154-5).3 More important was the temporary acquisition of Isfahan, transferred to Muhammad by the commander who had governed it on behalf of the Saljuqs of the west. Although Muhammad was clearly a bloodthirsty tyrant, he contrived by his ostentatious piety to make a good impression on the chroniclers. Muhammad b. Ibrahim, the local historian, praises the amir for his pensions to the ulema and his bursaries to poor students. He encouraged astronomy and the compilation of astronomical tables (taqvims); he built mosques and libraries in the chief towns of Kirman, e.g. Bardasir, Jiruft, and Bam; and he never killed anyone without first obtaining for this a fatwa from the religious authorities.4

SANJAR'S SULTANATE
X. S A N J A R ' S S U L T A N A T E I N T H E E A S T , A N D T H E RISE O F T H E KHWARAZM-SHAHS AND QARA-KHITAI
The fortunes of the eastern provinces of the Saljuq empire were directed for over fifty years by Abu'l-Harith Ahmad Sanjar {Sanjar Turkish for "he who thrusts, pierces") b. Malik-Shah.1 After the death of Arslan-Arghun in 490/1097, Berk-Yaruq had appointed his halfbrother Sanjar, then a lad of ten or twelve years, to the governorship of Khurasan (see above, p. 107). Sanjar remained ruler of the east until shortly after his escape from captivity amongst the Ghuzz; the hard ships which he had suffered there seem to have hastened his death in 552/1157. In the civil strife of Berk-Yaruq's reign, Sanjar took the side of his full brother Muhammad Tapar, but from the constitutional point of view he regarded himself during this period as subordinate to the sultan in Iraq and western Iran; thus on a coin of his from Marv, probably minted in 499/1105-6, he calls himself simply Malik alMashriq ( " K i n g of the East") and gives the title al-Saltdn al-Mtfa%%am ("Exalted Sultan") to Muhammad.2 However, when the latter died in 511/1118, Sanjar was not disposed to accept a similar status in regard to his nephew Mahmud b. Muhammad. In the past, as we have said, the supreme sultanate had gone to the Saljuq who held Iraq and western Iran, and at the beginning of his reign Mahmud's alliance with the Qarakhanids against his uncle might have been a sign of his determination to assert himself as head of the family and thus reduce Sanjar's pretensions.3 But the older Turkish principle of the seniorate now came to the fore, and Sanjar became generally regarded as supreme head of the family. Indeed, Mahmud had to acknowledge his own subordination at an early date: coins struck by him at Isfahan and dated 511/1118 and 512/1118-19 give Sanjar the title al-Sultdn alMu'aggam, whereas Mahmud is given simply his name and patronymic4 Sanjar's campaign in western Iran and his defeat of Mahmud at Saveh ^1513/1119 gave him the opportunity clearly to demonstrate his superior status (see pp. 119-20 above). A t Ray he treated Mahmud as his close vassal. Out of deference to Sanjar, Mahmud had to abandon

his personal privileges as sultan, such as the five-fold nauba (salute of military music). He had to hold Sanjar's bridle when he mounted; to prostrate himself before Sanjar; to walk on foot by his side from the audience chamber to Sanjar's personal tent, and to reside in the quarters of Sanjar's children and wives. Mahmud's chief officials received investiture patents directly from Sanjar, and Sanjar kept in his hands the city of Ray, perhaps not merely because of its strategic importance but also because during Toghril Beg's time it had been the capital of the Saljuqs in Iran. In Iraq Sanjar ordered the reappoint ment there of the shahna whom Mahmud had dismissed. In return, Sanjar made Mahmud his heir, and the two names henceforth appear together on Sanjar's coins. Whilst it is true that after 519/1125 Mahmud minted coins on which he himself was styled al-Sultdn al-Muc%%am and Sanjar was not mentioned, he remained essentially subordinate to his uncle.1 The relationship of Sanjar to his nephews stayed the same during the succeeding reigns of Toghril and Mas'ud, particularly since Toghril was directly beholden to him for his authority. However, at the outset of his reign Mas'ud rejected a command from Sanjar to execute certain amirs in his entourage, and thereby announced that he would not be a blind puppet of his uncle.2 Sanjar, increasingly preoccupied with such problems as the rise of the Khwarazm-Shahs and of the Qara-Khitai, allowed Mas'ud more freedom of action than might otherwise have been the case; yet with the passage of time the unparalleled length of Sanjar's rule in the east only strengthened his moral position as supreme sovereign. After Berk-Yaruq nominated him to the governorship of the east, Sanjar and his amirs had been faced with a certain amount of opposition from rival Saljuq princes. In 490/1097 Muhammad b. Sulaiman b. Chaghri Beg Da'ud, whom the sources call Amir-i Amirdn (" Supreme Commander"), obtained a force from the Ghaznavids and attempted to seize power in Khurasan; he was defeated by Sanjar's army and blinded. In the following year a Saljuq named Daulat-Shah, apparently a descendant of Er-Tash b. Ibrahim Inal, collected in Tukharistan a force of Turkmen malcontents, but was likewise defeated and blinded by Sanjar.3

SANJAR'S SULTANATE
137
In the early years of Berk-Yaruq's reign, the central and western parts of Khurasan (i.e. Nishapur, Tus, Isfara'in, Nasa, etc.), together with Qumis and Gurgan, were governed from Damghan by the Amir-i Dad Habashi b. Altun-Taq. Sanjar's base was at this time farther east, at Balkh, and it was a prime task for him and his amirs, Kundigiiz, Er-Ghush, and Rustam, to dislodge Habashi from Khurasan. In the ensuing warfare Habashi secured the help of 5,000 Isma'ili troops from Tabas—then in the hands of a Batini governor, Isma'Il Kalkali—and he was also joined by Sultan Berk-Yaruq, who had been compelled to flee eastwards after his defeat in 493/1100 at the hands of Muhammad (see above, p. 109). Habashi and Berk-Yaruq were nevertheless defeated by Sanjar and his amirs at a place called Naushajan, Habashi being captured and then killed, and Berk-Yaruq retiring to Gurgan and later Isfahan.1 From this time onwards the whole of Khurasan up to and including Qumis ^as firmly in San jar's hands, and he subsequently moved his capital to the more central city of Marv. N o w he could take direct action against the troublesome Isma'llis of Kuhistan; two expeditions against Tabas by the Amir Boz-Qush are recorded, in both of which regular troops and volunteers took part (494/1101 and 497/ 1104).2 Thus in these years, when he was still just one of the Saljuq maliks and subordinate to the sultans in the west, Sanjar was primarily con cerned to consolidate his power within Khurasan and to provide financial help or refuge to his brother Muhammad in his struggle against Berk-Yaruq.3 But this period was also one of turmoil and instability in the neighbouring kingdom of the Qarakhanids, vassals of the Saljuqs from Malik-Shah's time, and Sanjar was soon drawn into the affairs of Transoxiana. As pointed out on pp. 5-6 above, the rule of the Qarakhanids in Transoxiana, Semirechye, and Kashgharia was essen tially that of a loose tribal confederation, and internal dynastic con flicts were frequent. Sanjar was able to follow his Saljuq predecessors' examples and utilize these disputes for his own purposes. An important religious and political phenomenon is discernible in the Qarakhanid cities of Samarqand and Bukhara from the middle years of the 5th/nth century onwards. This is the tension between the

khans and the orthodox religious institution, despite the ostentatious Sunni piety and zeal for charitable works shown by many of the khans. It is difficult in any period of Islamic history to discern the true feelings of the urban masses; at certain critical points, for example, they seem to have supported the khans, and it was a revolt of the artisans of Bukhara which in 636/1238-9 ended the domination of the Burhani sudur. O n the other hand the military leaders, always jealous of any increase in the central power, gave direct assistance to the religious classes on several occasions. The just and devout Tamghach Khan Ibrahim was driven to execute Shaikh Abu'l-Qasim Samarqandi; then in the reign of Ahmad b. Khidr the faqihs called in the Saljuq MalikShah and in the end had the khan deposed and executed for alleged Isma'ill sympathies (pp. 92-3 above). The power of this clerical caste can be seen in the appearance of lines of hereditary religious leaders, especially in Bukhara, who often bear the honorary titles of Sudur or "prominent m e n " (sing. Sadr). Similarly in the j t h / n t h century there had been the imams (religious leaders) of the Saffari family; but Sanjar, in the course of his Transoxianan expedition of 495/1102, deposed the reigning ra'Is and imam of Bukhara, A b u Ishaq Ibrahim Saffari, and replaced him by the well-known scholar 'Abd al-'Aziz b. 'Umar of the Burhan family. He invested him personally with the sadara (religious leadership) and gave him a sister in marriage, so that 'Abd al-'Aziz and his successors of the Al-i Burhan became immediate vassals of the Saljuqs. Some decades later these sudur dealt directly with the QaraKhitai invaders of Transoxiana and collected the taxes of the Bukhara region for them. The authority of the Burhanis accordingly had a political and fiscal aspect as well as a religious one. The family retained its power under the Khwarazm-Shahs and early Mongols, in spite of a dark period when the Shah 'Ala' al-Din Muhammad deposed Sadr Burhan al-Din Muhammad b. Ahmad, and subsequently permitted his mother Terken Khatun to execute the imam.1 The line ended only with the popular rising of 636/1238-9 in Bukhara, after which a fresh series of sudur, that of the Mahbubis, begins.2
The western Qarakhanid throne in Transoxiana had been given by Berk-Yaruq to Sulaiman b. Da'ud b. Tamghach Khan Ibrahim in

SANJAR'S SULTANATE
490/1097; the throne then passed quickly to a Mahmud-Tegin and to Harun b. Sulaiman b. Qadir Khan Yusuf, who died in 495/1102. In this year Transoxiana was invaded by Qadir Khan Jibra'Il b. 'Umar of Talas and Balasaghun, who led an army which included both Muslim and pagan Turks. Berk-Yaruq and Muhammad were at this time involved in warfare, whilst Sanjar was in Baghdad, and the Qarakhanid Muhammad b. Sulaiman b. Da'ud fled to Sanjar's capital at Marv; but Qadir Khan Jibra'il pressed through Transoxiana, across the Oxus, and into Khurasan, aided by the defection of one of Sanjar's own amirs, Kun-Toghdi. In the end the invader was halted and then defeated and killed near Tirmidh by Sanjar, who had hurried eastwards, whilst Kun-Toghdi fled to the court of the Ghaznavid Mas'ud III b. Ibrahim. Sanjar then sent troops into Transoxiana and placed Muhammad on the throne in Samarqand; the latter took the Turkish ruling title of Arslan-Khan and remained ruler there till 524/1130. Sanjar also con cerned himself with the religious leadership in Transoxiana, and it was at this point that he gave the leadership of the Hanafis there to Sadr 'Abd al-'Aziz b. 'Umar of the Al-i Burhan. Like his father, ArslanKhan Muhammad was linked to the Saljuqs by a marriage alliance with one of Sanjar's daughters, and on two occasions in the next few years (496/1103 and 503/1109) Sanjar gave him military help against another Qarakhanid claimant, Saghun Beg.1 This rival has been identified by Pritsak as the Hasan b. 'All whom Sanjar was to place on the throne of Samarqand in 524/1030. The poet and literary stylist Rashid al-Din Vatvat gives Hasan Khan the title of Kok-Saghun, and it is probable that he came from the line of cAli b. Bughra Khan Harun, known as 'Ali-Tegin, who had ruled in Soghdia a century before and whose descendants had remained in Farghana.2 This rivalry excepted, Arslan-Khan Muhammad enjoyed a reign which was peaceful almost to the end of this life. He became noted as a great builder, rebuilding the citadel and walls of Bukhara and constructing there a fine Friday mosque and two palaces. He under took regular campaigns into the surrounding steppes, presumably against pagan Qipchaq, bringing back slaves and gaining the title Ghazi.3 Despite these laudable activities, the tension between the dynasty and the religious classes was not stilled. It may well have been

religious elements who in 507/1113-14 complained to Sanjar about the khan's tyranny, a trait which does not accord with the rest of our knowledge of him. In any case the khan was obliged to seek the inter cession of the Khwarazm-Shah Qutb al-Din Muhammad and of Sanjar's Amir Qaimaz, and to g o personally and meet the sultan.1 A t the end of his reign Arslan-Khan Muhammad became embroiled with the Saljuqs. By now a sick man, he ruled in association with his son Nasr. But an 'Alid faqih and the ra'Is of Samarqand, leaders of a group representing religious interests, conspired together and killed Nasr, whereupon the khan appealed to Sanjar for help and appointed another son, Ahmad, in Nasr's place. Ahmad assumed the title of QadirKhan and took draconian measures against the leaders of the plot, but Sanjar was now on his way with an army. Friction occurred between the khan's followers and the Saljuq army, and Sanjar captured Samar qand, plundering part of the city (524/1130). The sick Arslan-Khan surrendered to Sanjar, and, because he was the father of Sanjar's Qarakhanid wife Terken Khatun, was allowed to stay in the sultan's harem. He died soon afterwards, and in his place Sanjar appointed Hasan b. ' A l l ; on his death in 526/1132, Sanjar chose Arslan-Khan's brother Ibrahim, and he was followed by a third son of Arslan-Khan, Mahmud, later to be ruler of Khurasan during Sanjar's captivity amongst the Ghuzz (see below, pp. 153-7).2 It was this Mahmud who was reigning in Transoxiana when the Qara-Khitai appeared there a few years later.
The province of Khwarazm had passed into Saljuq hands on the defeat of Shah Malik, the son of the Oghuz Yabghu of Jand and Yengi-Kent (see p. 18 above). It had then come under governors representing the Saljuqs, and for the next few decades Khwarazm made little impact upon eastern Islamic history. Alp-Arslan came thither in 457/1065 to suppress a revolt, visiting Jand and pushing westwards across the list Urt plateau towards the Manqishlaq peninsula (see p. 65 above).3 He then appointed Arslan-Arghun as governor, and this man remained in office during the early part of Malik-Shah's

reign: an exception to the general rule of the time, for Khwarazm was usually granted to ghulam commanders rather than to members of the Saljuq dynasty itself, who, by the province's isolation, might rebel. It seems that the revenues of Khwarazm were used in Malik-Shah's reign to defray the expenses of a particular office in the royal household, that of the keeper of the wash-bowls (tasht-dar), for the ghulam AnushTegin Gharcha'i held this office and also bore the title " shahna of Khwarazm".1 The presence of Turkish governors in Khwarazm after the over throw of the Ma'munid Shahs in 408/1017—at first they had ruled on behalf of the Ghaznavids, and then on behalf of the Saljuqs—must have favoured the process whereby Khwarazm was gradually trans formed from an ethnically and culturally Iranian land into a Turkish one. For many centuries the distinctive local language of Khwarazm had been an Iranian tongue with affinities to Soghdian and, to a lesser extent, to Ossetian. It was still in full use during the Saljuqs' hegemony, not merely for speech but also for writing, with special diacritical marks added to the Arabic alphabet to express the sounds peculiar to Khwarazmian; these are found in some manuscripts of the Khwarazmian al-Biruni's works. Khwarazmian speech probably lasted in upper Khwarazm till the end of the 8th/14th century, but in lower Khwarazm and Gurganj, the region nearest to the Aral Sea, the process of Turkicization was complete in the 7th/i3th century, according to informa tion deducible from the travel narrative of the Franciscan John of Piano Carpini. Today the Khwarazmian language has to be reconstructed from such materials as odd words and phrases in al-Biruni's works, from the glosses on an Islamic legal text, and from a single literary work, a Khwarazmian version of an introduction to Arabic grammar and language by the famous exegete and grammarian, al-Zamakhshari (d. 5 38/1141). Geographically Khwarazm was a peninsula of advanced cultural and economic life jutting out into the Turkish steppes, and thus its Iranian character was made vulnerable to external ethnic and political as well as linguistic pressure. In the second half of the j t h / n t h century these steppes were controlled by Turks of the Qipchaq, Qanghli, Qun, and Pecheneg groups, not all of whom had yet become Muslim; the middle stretches of the Syr Darya were still Dar al-kufr ("lands of unbelief") in the 6th/12th century. The Saljuq governors recruited auxiliary troops

from these nomads, and in the latter half of the 6th/12th century the Khwarazm-Shah Atsi'z and his successors relied heavily on the Qipchaq, Qanghli, Yimek, and associated tribes for their armies. Hence they were brought within the boundaries of sedentary Khwarazm, and by settlement and intermarriage the older Iranian population was eventually diluted; already in the 5th/nth century the physical approximation of the Khwarazmian people to the Turkish type was noted.1 This linguistic and ethnic change was not, however, accompanied by any material or cultural impoverishment. Under the dynasty of Atsi'z, Khwarazm became for the first and last time in its history the centre of a great military empire which embraced large parts of Central Asia and Iran. The Khwarazmians were always great travellers, and their merchants continued to journey across the Eurasian steppes as far as southern Russia and even the Danube basin, where certain placenames attest their presence. Intellectually, Khwarazm was never so brilliant as in the 6th/i2th and 7th/13th centuries, when it produced great theologians and literary men, and in particular remained a centre of Arabic learning. The much-travelled geographer Yaqut (d. 626/ 1229), writing on the eve of the Mongol invasion, said that he had never seen such urban and agricultural prosperity as in Khwarazm; and the walled cities and fortified villages, canals and irrigation works disclosed by Soviet archaeologists confirm the view that the area of cultivated land expanded in the course of the 6th/12th century.2 In the latter part of Malik-Shah's reign the governor of Khwarazm was, at least titularly, the ghulam Anush-Tegin Gharcha'i. (The nisba probably refers to the region of Gharchistan in northern Afghanistan, where Anush-Tegin had been originally bought by a Saljuq amir; Kafesoglu has conjectured that he was of Khalaj Turkish origin.)3 Ekinchi b. Qochqar, a ghulam of Qun origin, was appointed as Khwarazm-Shah, probably on the occasion of Berk-Yaruq's expedition to Khurasan in 490/1097 against Arslan-Arghun. As Minorsky has

pointed out, Ekinchi must have had considerable renown, as well as a great knowledge of events in the region of Khwarazm and the steppes, to be nominated to this important post.1 A t the end of the same year, however, Ekinchi was killed by rebellious Saljuq amirs, so that BerkYaruq's representative in Khurasan, the Amir-i Dad Habashi, appointed in his stead Anush-Tegin's son Qutb al-Din Muhammad. As Khwarazm Shah from 490/1097 till his death in 521/1127 or 522/1128, Qutb al-Din had the reputation of being a just ruler who was always obedient to his master Sanjar.2 A t various points during the Saljuq succession-disputes in western Iran, he fought for Sultan Muhammad b. Malik-Shah and for Sanjar, and in 507/1113-14 he mediated between Arslan-Khan Muhammad of Samarqand and Sanjar (see above, p. 140). 'Ala' al-Din Atsiz succeeded his father and reigned as nominal vassal of the Saljuqs till his death in 551/1156. He came to the governorship of Khwarazm with a reputation, like that of Qutb al-Din Muhammad, for loyalty and submissiveness towards Sanjar. Despite this, the course of events was to show that Atsiz had his own ambitions to make Khwarazm as autonomous as possible, and although he had many reverses he pursued this goal with determination, feeling his way between the two neighbouring powers of the Saljuqs and the QaraKhitai, and laying the foundation for the fully independent policy of his successors. Juvaini and 'Aufi also praise Atsiz for his culture and learning, ascribing to him the composition of verses in Persian. In his early years as Khwarazm-Shah, Atsiz aimed primarily at securing the long and vulnerable frontiers of his principality against the nomads; since many of these were still pagans, his efforts earned him amongst the orthodox the tide of Ghazi. O f particular strategic importance here were the steppes between the Aral and Caspian seas, together with the adjacent Manqishlaq peninsula where many nomads had summer pastures, and the lower Syr Darya region from Utrar down to Jand. Both these areas had long been spring-boards for attacks on Khwarazm, and it was to Manqishlaq and Jand that the followers of Ekinchi b. Qochqar's son Toghril-Tegin had fled in 490/1097 after the latter's bid to regain Khwarazm had been frustrated by Qutb al-Din Muhammad.3 Atsiz attended Sanjar regularly, being

with him, for example, in the Transoxianan campaign of 524/1030, but he did not neglect the frontiers of Khwarazm. According to Ibn al-Athir, he had already secured Maqishlaq during his father's life time, and in 527/1133 he led a campaign from Jand into the Qipchaq steppes; Yaqut quotes a line of verse in praise of the Manqishlaq victory. After 536/1141 he secured the lower Syr Darya against the Qara-Khitai by paying them an annual tribute in cash and kind.1 It was not long before Atsi'z's relation with his suzerain Sanjar became strained. The sultan allegedly began to grow cold towards the Khwarazm-Shah during the campaign of 529/1135 against the Ghaznavid Bahram-Shah (p. 159 below), and in a proclamation of victory issued after his triumph at Hazarasp, Sanjar accused Atsi'z of killing Muslim ghazis and murabitun (frontier fighters) at Manqishlaq and Jand. In 533/1138 Atsiz rebelled openly, flooding much of the land along the Oxus to impede the advance of Sanjar's army. Yet this did not prevent the sultan from defeating the Khwarazmian army, which included some pagan Turks, at the fortress of Hazarasp; he then executed Atsi'z's son Atligh. He occupied Khwarazm and granted it to his nephew Sulaiman-Shah b. Muhammad, providing him with a vizier, an atabeg, and other administrative officials, but the advent of direct Saljuq rule proved irksome to the Khwarazmians. A s soon as Sanjar had left for Marv, Atsi'z returned from his refuge in Gurgan, and the people rose and expelled Sulaiman-Shah. Then in 534/1139-40 the Khwarazm-Shah took the offensive, capturing Bukhara from its Saljuq governor and destroying the citadel there. The extent to which Atsiz clearly commanded the sympathies of the Khwarazmians is an indication of the province's continued individuality and its need for a local ruler who could look after its special political and commercial interests. For all this, Sanjar's power and prestige were still formidable, and in 535/1141 Atsi'z found it expedient to submit to him.2 Four months later, Sanjar's unexpected and crushing defeat by the Qara-Khitai in the Qatvan steppe was obviously opportune for Atsi'z, so much so that several sources accuse him of having incited the

Qara-Khitai to rise against the sultan as an act of revenge for the killing of his son Atligh;1 but according to Juvaini, the invaders also passed from Transoxiana into Khwarazm, devastating the province and compelling Atsiz to pay tribute. When San jar fell back before the Qara-Khitai to Tirmidh and Balkh, Atsiz made two incursions into Khurasan in the course of 536/1141-2. In the first expedition he took Sarakhs and Marv, either killing or carrying off several of the local ulema, and appropriating the state treasury at Marv; he then returned the next spring to occupy Nishapur (where the khutba was made for him over the next three months), Baihaq, and other parts of Khurasan. Through his court poet Rashid al-Din Vatvat, the Khwarazm-Shah boasted that the power of the Saljuqs was at an end and his own dynasty was in the ascendant, but early in 537/1142 Saljuq rule was re-estab lished in Khurasan. In retaliation, the sultan in 538/1143-4 invaded Khwarazm, besieged Gurganj, and compelled Atsiz to submit and to return the treasuries taken from Marv; but once more the country proved too hostile for the Saljuqs to remain there.2 T o Sanjar's troubles with the Qara-Khitai were now added the first rumbles of discontent from the Ghuzz in Khurasan. Atsiz again showed himself rebellious, plotting the sultan's assassination by means of hired Isma'ilis and executing an envoy sent from the court at Marv. In 542/ 1147 San jar marched into Khwarazm for the third time, capturing Hazarasp and Gurganj, but in 543/1148 he allowed the KhwarazmShah to make a grudging submission. Atsiz's adventures in Khurasan and his attempts to throw off Saljuq suzerainty accordingly came to nought, so he turned once more to his original sphere of activity, the steppes surrounding Khwarazm. One of the consequences of his pre occupation with events in Khurasan and the south had been the loss of Jand, which had passed to one Kamal al-Din b. Arslan-Khan Mahmud, apparently a Qarakhanid and son of the khan who ruled in Samarqand from 526/1132 to 536/1141. A n expedition left Khwarazm in the summer of 547/1152 and occupied Jand without striking a blow. Although Juvaini states that Kamal al-Din had been a friend of Atsiz and of Vatvat, he was seized and jailed for the rest of his life. Jand was now placed under the governorship of Atsiz's son and

successor Il-Arslan—an illustration of the importance attached to the town.1 During Sanjar's captivity amongst the Ghuzz, Atsiz remained essen tially loyal to the Saljuq connexion. He did try to get Sanjar to grant him Amul-i Shatt, the strategically important crossing on the river Oxus, but its castellan refused to yield up his charge. A t one point the Khwarazm-Shah's brother Inal-Tegin marched into Khurasan, where he devastated the Baihaq oasis in 548-9/1154; Ibn Funduq says that the resultant destruction and depopulation were still visible fourteen years later.2 The Qarakhanid Mahmud Khan, who had been chosen as ruler of Khurasan by that part of Sanjar's army which had not joined the Ghuzz, now began negotiating with Atsiz for the dis patch of a Khwarazmian army into Khurasan to quell the Ghuzz. Atsiz and his son Il-Arslan set out for Khurasan, leaving a further son Khitai-Khan as regent of Khwarazm (551/1156), and whilst at Shahristan they received news of Sanjar's escape from the Ghuzz. Mahmud Khan and the other Saljuq amirs now regretted having invited the ambitious Atsiz into Khurasan, but in fact the latter behaved with restraint and did nothing provocative. He met Mahmud Khan and summoned for aid the Saffarid Abu'1-Fadl, the Bavandid Ispahbadh Shah Ghazi Rustam, and the Ghurid 'Ala' al-Din Husain; he sent Sanjar a florid letter of congratulation; and he warned Tuti Beg, most prominent of the Ghuzz leaders, of the consequences of further rebelliousness. Whatever Atsiz's real intentions, all was now ended, for he died at this point, nine months before Sanjar's own death. Thus he died as a vassal of the Saljuqs, yet the conquests he had made in the steppes and the assembling of a powerful mercenary army enabled his successors to make Khwarazm the nucleus of a powerful empire in the decades before the Mongol invasion: an empire whose part in attracting the Mongols westwards was to have incalculable consequences for the greater part of the Islamic world.3 Until the eighth century A . D . , there had been a certain amount of direct contact between the Iranian and the Chinese world. The T'ang dynasty (618-906) never believed that Transoxiana and the formerly Buddhist lands on the upper Oxus were totally lost to the Chinese

empire, although the immense distances involved made any direct control almost impossible. Nevertheless, after the disintegration of the Western Turk's steppe empire in the first half of the eighth century, the Chinese tried to assert their authority in Transoxiana. In 133/751 the Arab general Ziyad b. Salih defeated near Talas a Chinese army that had appeared in the Syr Darya valley, and the possibility of Chinese political control in this region vanished forever.1 But com mercial and religious movements across Central Asia continued for many centuries to bring some Chinese cultural influences and some luxury imports into the Iranian world. Chinese prisoners taken by Ziyad b. Salih are said to have taught the Muslims of Samarqand the art of paper-making, and fine porcelain brought from China became highly prized in the Islamic world.2 In the early part of the 6th/12th century there was an intrusion of the Chinese world into eastern Iran, in the shape of the Qara-Khitai invaders from northern China, although the Mongol invasions of the 7th/13th century were to prove more important in spreading Far Eastern cultural and artistic ideas in the Persian world. The domina tion of the Qara-Khitai affected only Transoxiana and, for a brief while, a strip to the south of the Oxus around Balkh; they did not exterminate existing ruling houses, as the Mongols were to do, but were content to receive tribute and to exercise a supreme overlordship. Perhaps the most significant feature of their dominion in Transoxiana and Semirechye was the temporary check it gave to the spread of Islam in the steppes. The Qara-Khitai possessed the traditional toler ance of the steppe peoples, who have always been at the receiving end of the great religions of Asia.3 They accorded the indigenous Muslims of Transoxiana no special preference among the adherents of other faiths; but neither did they persecute them. Ibn al-Athir says that the first Gur-Khan ("Supreme, Universal Khan") was a Manichaean;4 indeed, when the Christians of Europe first heard dimly of the defeats suffered by the Muslim Saljuqs and Khwarazm-Shahs, they thought that a great Christian power had arisen in Central Asia, and in this way legends about "Prester John" began to circulate in the West.

certain is that Qara-Khitai impartiality allowed the repressed adherents of non-Islamic faiths to flourish more openly, and this can be seen in the missionary enterprise and expansion begun in this period by the Nestorian Christians of eastern Iran and Central Asia.1 Grousset's verdict, that "the foundation of the Qara-Khitai empire may be viewed as a reaction against the work of Islamization accomplished by the Qarakhanids", may in this wise be true.2 Ethnically the Qara-Khitai were most probably Mongols.3 In Chinese sources they are first called the " K ' i - t a n " and then, after 947, the " L i a o " ; over the next two centuries they became deeply Sinicized and in the Chinese annals are accounted a native dynasty. In the tenth century they founded a vast empire stretching from the Altai to the Pacific, with its centre in northern China. The name of their empire, in the form Khata or Khita, was first applied by the Muslims to northern China, passing from them to the Europeans, whence the older English Cathay. Between 1116 and 1123, however, the K'i-tan were overthrown in China by a fresh wave of barbarian invaders, the Jurchet, a Tungusic people from the Amur valley and northern Manchuria. A section of the K'i-tan migrated westwards into Central Asia, where Islamic historians knew them as the Qara-Khitai, i.e. Black (or perhaps "Powerful, mighty") Khitai. This section came in two groups. One went into eastern Turkestan and came up against the branch of the Qarakhanids ruling there. Arslan-Khan Ahmad defeated them before they could reach Kashghar and captured their leader (whom Ibn al-Athir calls al-A£war, "the Oneeyed"); in a letter from Sanjar to the caliph in 527/1133 this victory is mentioned as a recent event. The other group, numbering some 40,000 tents, took a more northerly route through the Altai and came into the territories of the Qarakhanid ruler of Balasaghun, who tried to use the invaders against his own Qarluq and Qanghli enemies but instead found himself deposed. The Qara-Khitai leader, whose name appears in Chinese sources as Yeh-lu Ta-shih (d. 537/1143), now made the Chu valley the centre of his empire and assumed the title of Gur-Khan. His followers campaigned against the Qanghli in the steppes stretching

towards the Aral Sea, against the Kirghiz in the steppes to the north of the Chu, and against the Qarakhánids in Káshghar and Khotan. In 531/1137 they made contact with the Transoxianan Qarakhánids and defeated Mahmüd Khan b. Arslan Muhammad of Samarqand in the Syr Darya valley at Khujand. The Qara-Khitai halted here for four years, but in 536/1141 internal disputes in Samarqand opened the whole of Transoxiana to them. Several years earlier, Mahmüd Khan had invoked the aid of his suzerain Sanjar against the unruly Qarluq. According to cImad al-Din, their families and flocks had increased in number in the Samarqand region and had been damaging property and tillage; yet cImad al-Din also stresses the initial peaceableness of the Qarluq, who were harried by the sultan's agents, had their pastures reduced and their women and children enslaved, but still offered to pay Sanjar an extensive tribute in beasts. Only after this did they appeal to the Qara-Khitai to intercede for them with the sultan. Sanjar brusquely rejected this approach, and seems deliberately to have made it a casus belli against the Qara-Khitai. The latter now invaded Transoxiana in force, and in 5 36/1141 a bloody battle was fought in the Qatván steppe in Ushrüsana, to the east of Samarqand. The Muslim losses were huge, and Amir Qumach, the amir of Sistan, and Sanjar's Qarakhánid wife were all captured. Sanjar and Mahmüd Khan abandoned Transoxiana and fled to Tirmidh; the Gür-Khán occupied Bukhara, killing the Burháni sadr Husarn al-Din 'Umar, and he sent an army under his commander Erbüz to ravage Atsiz's dominions in Khwarazm.1 Sanjar's defeat meant the permanent loss of Saljuq sovereignty beyond the Oxus, while the Muslims there fell under "infidel" control. In practice the Qara-Khitai were not fanatics, and Islamic sources speak of the equitable government of the first Gür-Kháns, whereas there had been frequent complaints about the oppression of Sanjar's amirs. According to the later historian Muslih al-Din Lari, the people of Herat rejoiced in 542/1147 when their city passed from the tyranny of the Saljuqs to the just rule of 'Alá' al-Din Husain Ghürí; and the

boundless justice of the first Gur-Khan forms the subject of one of Nizami 'Amdi's anecdotes in the Chahdr Maqdla.1 Within their newlyacquired territories the Qara-Khitai allowed a wide degree of local autonomy: often, for example, existing political and tribal institutions were retained and their members required to collect and forward taxation to the Gur-Khans' ordu (military camp) in the Chu valley; this was the arrangement eventually made with the sudur of Bukhara. What did suffer irreparably was Sanjar's own prestige, and he spent the rest of his reign striving to preserve his remaining possessions. Beyond Khurasan were young and expanding powers such as the Khwarazm-Shahs and Ghurids; within there was mounting insubordi nation among the Saljuq amirs and increasing lack of control over the Turkmen. Atsiz seized his chance to invade northern Khurasan in 536/1141-2, and in a proclamation to the people of Nishapur he said that Sanjar's defeat was a divine retribution for ingratitude towards his loyal servant the Khwarazm-Shah.2 News of the Qara-Khitai victory reached the Christian West, causing an access of hope that the tide might now be turning against Islam. In letting Sanjar be defeated, writes Sibt b. al-Jauzi, " G o d took vengeance for [the murdered caliph] al-Mustarshid and let loose on him ruin and destruction". From this we may conclude that caliphal circles in Iraq at this time enjoyed a certain amount of Schadenfreude, even though Sanjar had in the preceding year attempted to improve relations with Baghdad by returning to al-Muqtafi the Prophet's cloak (burda) and the sceptre (qadib), which had been taken from al-lkustarshid.3 The historians describe Khurasan as being in a flourishing state during Sanjar's time, and this may well be true of at least the first decades of his reign. He preserved an unusually long continuity of administration, during which the seat of government, Marv, became a vital centre for culture and intellectual life.4 A comparatively rich documentation, in the form of collections of official correspondence, shows that the sultan was aware of his responsibility for provincial administration, even though this was usually delegated to ghulam military commanders or occasionally to Saljuq maliks. However, it is not so clear from these documents how much check and control from the centre there really was. In an investiture patent for the governor

ship of Gurgan, given to his nephew Mas'ud b. Muhammad (later sultan in the west), Sanjar points out the importance of such duties as the defence of the region against the pagan Turks of Dihistan and Manqishlaq, a strict adherence to the tax rates laid down by the central divan in Marv, and the adoption of a generally kind attitude towards the people.1 Nevertheless, social unrest in the countryside and the violence of 'ayyars and religious factions in the towns were certainly not stilled in Sanjar's reign. There was, for instance, an emeute in 510/ 1116-17 at T u s when the tomb of the Shfi Imam 'AH al-Rida was attacked, presumably by Sunni partisans; the local governor then built a high wall round the shrine.2 The Isma'Ilis continued to be active, especially in Kuhistan. In 520/1126 troops under Sanjar's Vizier Mucin al-Mulk Abu Nasr Ahmad marched against Turaithith, or Turshiz, in Kuhistan, and also against Tarz in the Baihaq district, and Ibn Funduq mentions operations in others years against the Isma'ilis of Tarz. In 530/1136 the Saljuq governor at Turshiz was forced to call in Ghuzz tribesmen against the Isma'ilis, but on this occasion the cure proved worse than the disease. Sanjar's captivity amongst the Ghuzz and the breakdown of all central government in Khurasan inevitably favoured the activities of the Batiniyya. In 549/1154 a force of 7,000 Kuhistan Isma'ilis banded together to attack Khurasan whilst the Saljuq forces were being distracted by the Ghuzz. They marched against Khwaf in northern Kuhistan, but were decisively repelled by the amirs Muham mad b. Oner and Farrukh-Shah al-Kasani. However, in 551/1156 they sacked Tabas, causing great bloodshed and capturing several of Sanjar's officials and retainers.3 One of Sanjar's most pressing problems was that of controlling the pastoralist nomads, who, since the Saljuq invasions of the previous century, had become a permanent element in the demography and economy of Khurasan. These Turkmen increased in numbers in the latter part of Sanjar's reign, perhaps because of pressure both from ethnic movements in the Qipchaq steppe and from the rising power of the Qara-Khitai in Transoxiana. It was of course always difficult for the Saljuq administration to maintain a firm external frontier along

the Atrak and Oxus, but by exacting taxation either on flocks or individual tents, it did try to control those nomads who were within the boundaries of the empire. Although the Turkmen were an unruly and intractable class, a permanent drag on the machinery of settled government, the Saljuqs always felt that they had obligations to them because they had been the original support of their dynasty, and Nizam al-Mulk's opinion concerning the Turkmen's rights continued to have validity (see p. 79 above). Since they were a clearly defined class of the population, special administrative arrangements were often made for the areas where they were most numerous. One such region was that of Gurgan and Dihistan, and there is extant the text of a diploma from Sanjar's chancery to Inanch Bilge Ulugh Jandar Beg appointing him military administrator of the Turkmen there. In this document Inanch Bilge is enjoined to treat the Turkmen well, to share out water and pasture fairly, to refrain from imposing fresh taxes, and generally to act as the channel between the nomads and the sultan.1 The military campaigns which increasingly occupied Sanjar after 529/1135 imposed fresh financial burdens on his subjects; the sultan is said to have expended three million dinars on his campaign of 536/ 1141 against the Qara-Khitai, not counting the cost of the presents and robes of honour which had to be offered during the course of this expedition into Transoxiana.2 Both sedentaries and Turkmen began to feel increased pressure from the sultan's financial agents, and it was a group of Oghuz or Ghuzz who occupied pastures in Khuttal and Tukharistan, on the upper Oxus banks, who finally rebelled against these demands. Ibn al-Athir quotes " certain historians of Khurasan" (presumably including Ibn Funduq, author of the Mashdrib al-tajdrib), and asserts that these particular Ghuzz had been driven from Transoxiana by the Qarluq, and had then been invited into Tukharistan by the local amir Zangi b. Khalifa al-Shaibani. Whilst in their previous home they had been allowed by Atsiz to spend the winter pasturing on the borders of Khwarazm. They were divided into two tribal groups, the Bo^uq under Qorqut b. 'Abd al-Hamid, and the Vch-Oq led by Tutl Beg b. Ishaq b. Khidr; other amirs are named as Dinar, Bakhtiyar, Arslan,

Chaghri, and Mahmud.1 Sanjar's representatives at Balkh was the ghulam amir 'Imad al-Din Qumach, formerly the sultan's atabeg, who is described as both governor of the province of Tukharistan, where he held extensive iqta's, and shahna of the Turkmen there. The capture of Sanjar in 548/1153 was only the climax of a period of discord—a discord aggravated by Qumach's harshness; before this, Tuti Beg and Qorqut had been faithful attendants at Sanjar's court.2 When Qumach defeated his enemy Zangi b. Khalifa, he at first confirmed the Ghuzz in their Tukharistan pastures. He also recruited them as auxiliary troops when the Ghurid cAla' al-Din Husain attacked Balkh in 547/1152, but the Ghuzz soon defected to the Ghurids, enabling 'Ala' al-Din temporarily to capture Balkh.3 Henceforth, Qumach's hostility towards the Ghuzz was sharpened. They were accustomed to paying an annual tribute of 24,000 sheep for the sultan's kitchens, but this was being extracted with increasing brutality, and when at last the Ghuzz killed a tyrannical tax collector (muhassil), Qumach had a pretext for attacking and expelling them. He assembled against them an army of 10,000 cavalry. T o placate him, the Ghuzz offered a payment of 200 dirhams per tent. Qumach refused this, and in the ensuing battle he and his son cAla' al-Din Abu Bakr were both slain. Fearing the sultan's wrath, the Ghuzz offered a large propitiatory payment in cash, beasts, and slaves, together with an annual tribute; under the influence of his amirs, Sanjar rejected this peace-offering and in 548/1153 set out from Marv with an army. Twice defeated by the Ghuzz, he fell back to Marv but was forced to evacuate the capital, and on leaving it he and several of his amirs were captured by the Ghuzz. Marv, meanwhile, was plundered and claimed by the Ghuzz leader Bakhtiyar as his personal iqtac, and the Ghuzz swept on through the other towns of Khurasan. In 549/1154 Nishapur was attacked and, after a struggle, its citadel taken; Ibn al-Athir's source says that corpses were piled up in the streets and that the Ghuzz dragged out those sheltering in the Manf! mosque and burnt its famous library. Only the

Mashhad 'AH al-Rida at Tus, and those towns such as Herat and Dihistan which had strong walls, escaped them. Initially the Turkmen seem to have been actuated by a special animosity against the Saljuq court and administration; all the amirs captured with Sanjar were executed, and many members of the religious institution, which was closely linked with the established order, were put to death. Even so, the sources may well exaggerate the numbers of those killed. Koymen has added up all those scholars whom the sources say were murdered by the Ghuzz, and his figure of fifty-five is hardly a colossal one.1 The limited numbers of dead given by contemporary biographers such as Sam'ani and Ibn Funduq are clearly more reliable than the vast figures given by later historians. It is also certain that indigenous anti-social elements in Khurasan seized the opportunity offered by the Ghuzz rebellion to pursue their own paths of violence and rapine; it is recorded, for example, that in Nishapur at this time the local 'ayyars behaved worse than the Ghuzz.2 On first being captured, Sanjar did not realize the serious position he had fallen into—for were not the Ghuzz from the same stock as him self? They placed him on the throne each day and, initially at least, kept up the pretence that he was the master and they his obedient slaves. But he was closely guarded, and Juvaini says that after an attempted escape Sanjar was kept in an iron cage; it is likely that towards the end he suffered contemptuous treatment, hunger, and other deprivations, for according to Sibt b. al-Jauzi, Sanjar's name became proverbial amongst the people of Baghdad for wretchedness and humiliation.3 The Saljuq army was left headless, and ambitious amirs were now able to indulge their desires for power. Many of the less-disciplined rankand-file either joined the Ghuzz or else ravaged the province indepen dently; in 522/1157 a section of the army of Khurasan attacked the caravan of the Pilgrimage of Khurasan at Bistam, killing, plundering, and leaving the pilgrims in such a defenceless state that they were an easy prey for the local Isma'llls.4 The most important of Sanjar's amirs, together with his vizier Nasir al-Din Tahir b. Fakhr al-Mulk b. Nizam al-Mulk, came to

SANJAR'S SULTANATE
155
Nishapur after the sultan's capture and decided to set up the Saljuq Sulaiman-Shah b. Muhammad as their sultan; Sulaiman-Shah had long lived at the court, and as Sanjar's vail cahd had been mentioned in the khutba of Khurasan. He and a detachment of the Saljuq army left Mar^ to engage the Ghuzz and recapture Sanjar, but they fled at the first encounter with them. Indeed, Sulaiman-Shah proved a feeble and ineffective ruler at a time when strong leadership in the face of two centrifugal forces, the ambitious Saljuq amirs and the destructive Ghuzz, was necessary. After the Vizier Tahir died, to be succeeded by his son Nizam al-Mulk Hasan, Sulaiman-Shah decided to abandon the struggle to enforce his rights as sultan. In 549/1154 he finally left Khurasan for Atsiz's court, where for a time he was well received and married one of the shah's nieces. But he fell out of favour and had to leave Khwarazm; so he decided to try his luck in western Iran and Iraq, where the succession after his brother Mahmud's death had not been satisfactorily settled; finally he arrived in Baghdad (see p. 176 below). The army of Khurasan now offered the throne to the Qarakhanid Mahmud Khan. After the Qara-Khitai victory of 536/1141 Mahmud had fled with Sanjar, while the Qara-Khitai had set up Mahmud's brother Tamghach-Khan Ibrahim III as their ruler in Samarqand; he retained the throne as their tributary until he was killed in 551/1156 by his own Qarluq troops (see p. 187 below). Mahmud was the son of Sanjar's sister, who had married Arslan-Khan Muhammad, and this Saljuq connexion, together with his princely blood from the house of Afrasiyab, made him a suitable candidate for the throne. The Saljuq sultan in the west, Muhammad b. Mahmud, agreed to the choice and sent from Hamadan an investiture diploma.1 Yet the fact that the Saljuq amirs were quite prepared to abandon the direct line of the Saljuqs illustrates clearly the decline in Sanjar's prestige and that of the dynasty in general. The real power in Khurasan was falling into the hands of the Saljuq amirs, and in the next few years the province became parcelled out amongst these commanders. The most powerful and successful of these was Sanjar's former ghulam Mu'ayyid al-Din Ai-Aba (d. 569/ 1174), who for almost twenty years was to be one of the most promi nent figures in Khurasanian affairs. Ibn Funduq calls him the "Khusrau [Emperor] of Khurasan, King of the East".2 Ai-Aba began by driving the Ghuzz out of Nishapur, Tiis, Nasa, Abivard, Shahristan, and

156
Damghan, henceforth establishing himself at Nishapur as the local ruler. There he became known for his justice and good rule—e.g. he lowered taxation and conciliated the landowning classes—so that his effective power began to spread all over the province. Similarly another one of Sanjar's ghulams, Ikhtiyar al-Din Ai-Taq, left Khurasan when the Ghuzz rebellion broke out and assumed power at Ray, where, his power legitimized by the western sultan Muhammad b. Mahmud and by Sulaiman-Shah in Marv, he built up a large army and made himself a considerable power in northern Iran. When Mahmud Khan was made sultan of Khurasan, Ai-Aba at first refused to hand over power to him; only after long negotiations did he agree to become Mahmud's tribu tary, whilst nevertheless keeping effective control over the parts of Khurasan which he held.1 Mahmud felt unable to subdue the Ghuzz single-handed and invited in the Khwarazm-Shah Atsiz, who died, however, before any practical steps against them could be taken (see above, p. 146). As for the Ghuzz themselves, their disunity and low level of political and social sophistication prevented them from establishing a territorial administration in Khurasan, despite their military successes. Hence they did not emulate the Saljuq invaders of a century or so before; on this situation Ravandi comments that the Ghuzz had the military power but lacked the essential qualities of justice and righteousness without which no state can be founded.2 They do, however, seem to have had some slight diplomatic contact with those powers outside Khurasan who had seized on Sanjar's embarrassments as a chance to advance their own claims. 'Ala' al-Din Husain corresponded with them over the extradition of the poet Anvari, who had satirized the Ghiirid ruler. And we have seen that under Shah Ghazi Rustam, the Bavandids of Tabaristan expanded beyond their mountain principality into Qumis and Dailam, where in 552/1157 Shah Ghazi devastated Alamut and enslaved a large number of Isma'ilis (pp. 28-9 above). It seems that early in Shah Ghazi's reign the Isma'Ilis had murdered his son, and this would account for his unrelenting enmity towards them. The Ghuzz leaders Tuti Beg and Qorqut, who exercised some degree of authority among them, sent envoys to Shah Ghazi, encouraging his ambitions for the conquest of western Iran and promising him a share of Khurasan in return for his alliance.3

SANJAR'S SULTANATE
*57
Towards the end of Sanjar's three-year captivity, the disunity and fragmentation of the Ghuzz became more pronounced. Then in 551/ 1156 a group of the Ghuzz were suborned, and Sanjar succeeded in escaping to Tirmidh and Marv. A year later, at the age of seventy-one, Sanjar died, and with him the authority of the Saljuqs in eastern Iran virtually ceased; Sanjar himself while on his deathbed appointed the Qarakhanid Mahmud Khan as his successor. The death of a monarch who had reigned for over sixty years as malik and then as sultan seemed to contemporaries the end of an epoch, and they expressed wonder at the might of a man whose name was in the khutba from Mecca to Kashghar.1
XI. T H E EASTERN FRINGES OF T H E I R A N I A N W O R L D : T H E E N D
OF THE G H A 2 N A V I D S A N D T H E UPSURGE OF THE GHURIDS
Under Ibrahim of Ghazna's son 'Ala' al-Daula Mas'ud III (492-508/ 1099-1115) the Ghaznavid empire extended over the regions of Ghazna, Kabul, Bust, Qusdar, Makran, and northern India. It continued to be oriented primarily towards the Indian subcontinent, and the dynasty continued to be respected as the spearhead of the faith in the Islamic world. Mas'ud had close marriage ties with the Saljuqs—his wife Mahd-i 'Iraq was Sanjar's sister—and all through his reign peaceful relations were maintained with the Saljuqs. Between the Ghaznavid territories and Saljuq Khurasan lay the buffer province of Ghur, in central Afghanistan, a mountainous and inacces sible region which was at times subordinate to Ghazna, or to the Saljuqs, but on the whole little disturbed by either. A t one point Ibrahim of Ghazna had marched into Ghur at the invitation of some of the chiefs there and had deposed Amir 'Abbas b. Shith of the local Shansabani line. He then set up 'Abbas's son Muhammad as amir of Ghur, and Muhammad remained till his death a faithful vassal of the Ghaz navids. In his grandson 'Izz al-Din Husain, however, who came to power in 493/1100 and began a long reign in Ghur as tributary to Sanjar and the Saljuqs, we see an indication of the relative decline of the Ghaznavids. It seems that in 501/1107-8 Sanjar led a raid into Ghur; the stimulus for this is not known, but it is likely that the Ghuri tribesmen, always notorious for their banditry, had been harassing the fringes of Saljuq territory in Badghis and Kuhistan. Sanjar captured

Husain, and Ghur must now have passed into the Saljuq sphere of influence. According to the Ghurid historian JuzjanI, Husain sent annually to San jar the specialities of his region, arms and armour and dogs of the fierce local breed.1 Therefore the energies of Mas'ud III of Ghazna were in large part deflected towards India, where his son cAdud al-Daula Shir-Zad was viceroy at Lahore. During this time the general Toghan-Tegin is said to have penetrated farther across the Ganges than anyone had ever done since the great Mahmud's time.2 Mas'ud died in 508/1115, and after the brief reign of Shir-Zad another son, Arslan-Shah, became sultan for three years (509-12/1115-18). A succession struggle between Arslan-Shah and another brother of his, Bahram-Shah, brought about the intervention of San jar and a Saljuq declaration of suzerainty over the Ghaznavid empire. Arslan-Shah imprisoned all his numerous brothers, and only Bahram-Shah managed to escape to Khurasan, where he sought Saljuq assistance. Arslan-Shah also treated with indignity his father's widow, Sanjar's sister, even though she was probably his own mother.3 Hence Sanjar had a double pretext for intervention. T o Sultan Muhammad in western Iran, the supreme head of the dynasty Arslan-Shah complained about Sanjar's threatening attitude, but this did not avert a Saljuq invasion from Khurasan. Accompanied by a contingent under the tributary Saffarid amir of Sistan, Taj al-Din Abu'l Fadl, the Saljuq army appeared at Bust and defeated Arslan-Shah. Sanjar now# came personally, refusing all peace offers. In a battle outside Ghazna Arslan-Shah had 30,000 troops and 120 elephants, each with four armed men on its back. But Sanjar gained the victory, and he entered Ghazna to acquire an immense booty of treasure and jewels, and to place Bahram-Shah on the throne (510/1117). The latter agreed to pay an annual tribute of 250,000 dinars and to make the khutba for Muhammad and Sanjar—the first time that the Saljuq khutba had ever been heard in Ghazna. Not even Malik-Shah had achieved this, for when he had desired to introduce it Nizam al-Mulk had deterred him, out of respect for the old-established Ghaznavid dynasty. On Sanjar's departure Arslan-Shah came back

from Lahore and reoccupied Ghazna briefly, but Bahram-Shah, again securing Saljuq help, captured and executed his brother.1 Bahram-Shah now began a reign of thirty-five years (512-47/1118-5 2) as a vassal of the Saljuqs; this we know because all his coins, except those of Indian type minted at Lahore, have Sanjar's name before his own. His reign was one of particular cultural splendour, and it forms a late flowering of the civilization of the Ghaznavids. Led by Sayyid Hasan and Sana'i, there was a numerous circle of court poets; it was to the sultan that the latter dedicated his magnum opus, the Hadiqat al-haqiqa, and likewise to him that Abu'l-Ma'ali Nasrallah dedicated his Persian translation of Kalila wa Dimna. However BahramShah had to quell revolts by the governor of India, Muhammad Bahlim; and then in 529/1135 the sultan himself became restive under Saljuq domination. Despite wintry conditions, Sanjar, accom panied by the Khwarazm-Shah Atsiz, marched through northern Afghanistan and occupied Ghazna. Bahram-Shah, who had meanwhile fled, returned shortly afterwards and submitted to Sanjar, who restored him to his throne and then returned to Balkh.2 But Bahram-Shah's reign was not to end peacefully. The long dominion of the house of Sebiik-Tegin was drawing to its close, and the instrument of its overthrow was not to be Sanjar, occupied as he was in Khurasan and Transoxiana, but the Shansabani rulers of Ghur. That this line of petty chiefs should burst forth and compete on equal terms with such dynasties as the Saljuqs, the Ghaznavids, and the Khwarazm-Shahs, is one of the most remarkable phenomena of the period. Y e t the forces underlying this dynamism are very imperfectly understood. The medieval topography and history of Ghur are known only fragmentarily for its isolation made the Islamic geographers and historians neglect it almost totally; and our knowledge of the Shansabani dynasty would be meagre indeed were it not for the Tabaqdt-i Ndsiri of the 7th/13th-century author Juzjani, in effect a special history of the Ghurids.3 Until the 5th/nth century, Ghur remained a pagan enclave ringed

with Muslim ribàts and known chiefly as a source for slaves. Islam first came with the early Ghaznavids. After his expedition of 401/1010-11 Mahmùd left teachers to instruct the Ghûrïs in the precepts of Islam, and he appointed as ruler there a pliant member of the Shansabânïs, a family from Ahangarân on the upper Harï Rùd. This chieftain is praised by Jùzjànï as the man who firmly implanted Islam in Ghùr, but it is likely that paganism persisted there at least till the end of the century. Originally the Shansabânïs were merely one family of petty chiefs among many in Ghûr, but by their ruthlessness and ambition they gradually made themselves supreme there. The main branch of the family became established in the 6th/12th century at Firûzkûh, and pari passu with the decline of the Ghaznavids the fortunes of the Ghùrids rose.1 With 'Alà' al-Din Husain b. Tzz al-Din Husain (544-56/1149-61) the Ghùrids broke out of the confines of their own province and succeeded to the heritage of the Ghaznavids, eventually becoming the greatest single power on the eastern fringes of the Islamic world. A s early as 542/1147 the Ghùrids were tempted to intervene at Herat, when its governor rebelled against Sanjar. Bahrâm-Shâh feared the nascent strength of the Ghùrids, and although 'Alâ' al-Din's brother Qutb alDin Muhammad was related by marriage to the Ghaznavids, the sultan nevertheless had him poisoned; Jùzjànï traces the enmity between the two dynasties to this event.2 Bahrâm-Shâh killed a further brother, Saif al-Din Sùrï, and it was left to 'Ala' al-Din Husain to take vengeance. He led an army from Fïrùzkùh into Zamïndâvar, where, despite the formidable array of elephants fielded by Bahrâm-Shâh, he defeated the sultan three times and pursued him into Ghazna. The capital was now given over to a frightful seven days' orgy of plundering and destruction, which earned for 'Alâ' al-Dïn the title Jahân-Sû^ ("WorldIncendiary"); as a final gesture of spite, the corpses of all but three of the Ghaznavid sultans were exhumed and burnt (545/115o-i).3

Bahram-Shah fled to his Indian possessions. Only when the Ghurid army had left did he return to Ghazna, and there he died shortly afterwards (547/1152). His son Khusrau-Shah succeeded, but Ghurid pressure compelled him to retire to Lahore, where he died in 555/ибо.1 The final Ghaznavid sultan, Khusrau-Malik, was, like his father, ruler in the Punjab only. The fifteen years' occupation of Ghazna by a group of Ghuzz from Khurasan, who had seized the city after 'Ala' al-Din Husain's death, temporarily held up the Ghurid advance into the Indian plain; but 'Ala' al-Din's nephew, Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad b. Sam, attacked and expelled the Ghuzz from Ghazna, and by 579/1183-4 he was besieging Lahore. In 582/1186-7 Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad finally annexed the Punjab, deposing Khusrau-Malik and carrying him off to imprisonment in G h u r , thus extinguishing the Ghaznavid line.2 T o the west of Ghur the main obstacle to the Shansabanis' expansion was at first the Saljuqs. 'Ala' al-Din, elated by his capture of Ghazna, was little disposed to continue as Sanjar's tributary. He stopped the payment of tribute and in 547/1152 advanced down the Hari Rud, but after being decisively defeated by Sanjar at Nab near Herat, he was captured and held prisoner until a large ransom was paid over. Before his death 'Ala' al-Din abandoned the title of Malik, with which his dynasty had so far been content, and in imitation of the Saljuqs and Ghaznavids called himself al-Sultdn а1-Ми'а%%ат? From this time onwards the Ghurid dynasty split into two and ultimately three lines. The main one established itself in Ghur proper, where Qutb al-Din Muhammad (540-1/1145-6) founded the fortress of Firuzkuh in a strategic position on the headwaters of the Hari Rud, and this became the sultans' summer capital.4 The second branch reigned from Bamiyan over Tukharistan and Badakhshan (and also, according to Juzjani, over the Transoxianan territories of Chaghaniyan and Vakhsh); these regions had been conquered by 'Ala' al-Din after his Ghazna victory and given to his brother Fakhr al-Din Mas'ud, who bore the title Malik. And third, after expelling the Ghuzz from Ghazna in 569/1173, Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad set up his brother Shihab al-Din or Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad, as sultan in Ghazna, while he himself retained the

ancestral territory of Ghur and ruled from Firuzkuh as supreme head of the dynasty.1 The empire reached its apogee in the generation or so spanned by the reigns of Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad (sultan in Ghur, 558-99/11631203) and of his younger brother Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad (sultan in Ghazna, 569-602/1173-1206). The partnership and amity between the two was a rare phenomenon for the age, but the dual aspect of the empire—i.e. its expansionist policy in Khurasan and the west, and its succession to the Ghaznavid ghazi-tradition in India and the eastfavoured such a division of power. In India Mu'izz al-Din campaigned in the Punjab and the Ganges valley, capturing Delhi in 589/1193; he wrested Multan from the local Isma'ills in 571/1175-6, and he pene trated to the coasts of Sind and Gujerat.2 Although latterly he became preoccupied with the defence of the Khurasanian conquests, his Turkish ghulam commanders, such as Qutb al-Din Aibeg, Ikhtiyar alDin Muhammad Khalji, and Nasir al-Din Qabacha, continued to carry on raids in India; and such was the quality of Mu'izz al-Din's leadership and the loyalty which he inspired that these slave amirs in India continued proudly to call themselves "Mu'izzi", and to place the dead sultan's name on their coins for some decades after the Ghurid dynasty proper had disappeared.3 The "World-Incendiary" 'Ala' al-Din Husain was briefly succeeded by his son Saif al-Din Muhammad (5 56-8/1161-3), who reversed his father's policy of toleration towards the Isma'Ilis in Ghur and drove them out to Kuhistan.4 Indeed, the Ghurids now become conspicuous for their Sunni piety, earning laudatory mention in the sources. Abandoning their support of the literalist Karamiyya sect, which was strong amongst the people of Ghur, they adhered to the Shafi'i law school, with its greater social prestige and intellectual reputation.5 Ghiyath al-Din kept up cordial relations with the 'Abbasid caliphs in Baghdad. Ambassadors were frequently exchanged, and the sultan sought membership in one of the chivalric orders, known collectively

as the futuwwa, b y means o f w h i c h al-Nasir w a s seeking t o restore the secular and moral power of the caliphate (see p. 168 below).1 T h e caliph also encouraged Ghurid ambitions in Khurasan as a counter weight to the Khwarazm-Shahs, whose advance into western Iran was causing deep concern in Baghdad. When Saif al-Din Muhammad was killed in battle with the Ghuzz near Marv, his cousin Ghiyath al-Din was raised to the throne at F i r u z k u h b y the a r m y . 2 G h i y a t h a l - D i n h a d first o f all t o deal w i t h a coalition of his enemies raised up by his uncle Fakhr al-Din Mas'ud of Bamiyan, w h o claimed that the throne should have passed to him by right of seniority. In a battle at Ragh-i Zar, between Herat and Firuz kuh, he defeated Fakhr al-Din and killed the Turkish governors of Balkh and Herat, Qumach and Yildiz, both former ghulams o f San jar. Fakhr al-Din was restored to Bamiyan in 559/1163, and Ghiyath al-Din began to extend his authority over outlying parts of Afghanistan. Gharchistan, Guzgan, Badghis, and Zamindavar were all secured, and the Ghuzz were ejected from Ghazna. Khurasan, where the collapse of Saljuq power had left a vacuum, n o w claimed his attention. In 571/1175-6 Sanjar's old ghulam Baha' al-Din Toghril had to abandon Herat to the sultan. Shortly afterwards the amir of Sistan, Taj al-Din Harb b. Muhammad, acknowledged Ghiyath al-Din as his suzerain and on several occasions sent troop contingents to the Ghurid armies; even the amirs of the Ghuzz in Kirman, w h o had succeeded there to the local Saljuq dynasty, sent envoys to Firuzkuh.3 Juzjani alleges that there w a s originally an entente b e t w e e n G h i y a t h al-Din and the Khwarazm-Shah Tekish, yet this seems unlikely, for a clash between these two great powers of the east was not long delayed.4 For some time Ghiyath al-Din sheltered Tekish's fugitive brother Sultan-Shah, although he refused to give him military aid. SultanShah eventually got help from the Qara-Khitai and assembled at Marv an army with which to attack the Ghurid province of Badghis. In response Ghiyath al-Din summoned troops from Bamiyan and Sistan, as well as from his brother Mu'izz al-Din in Ghazna, and in 586/1190 he defeated Sultan-Shah near Marv, taking over some of his Khurasanian territories.5

In addition to their territories north of the Oxus, the Qara-Khitai had a foothold in Tukharistan, south of the river. Dislodging the infidels from here became the goal of the Bamiyan Ghurids, w h o , as supporters of orthodoxy, welcomed this opportunity for jihad. In 594/1198 Baha' al-Din Sam occupied Balkh after the death of its Turkish governor, w h o had paid tribute to the Qara-Khitai.1 In the same year a general war broke out in Khurasan between the Ghurids on one side and the Khwarazm-Shahs and their Qara-Khitai suzerains on the other. Fighting had begun in 590/1194, when the death of the last Saljuq sultan in the west, Toghril b. Arslan, had brought the Khwar azm-Shah to the borders of Iraq (see p. 182 below). A l t h o u g h the caliph al-Nasir had wittingly set this train of events in motion, he n o w sent envoys to Firuzkuh imploring Ghurid help. Ghiyath al-Din accordingly threatened to attack Tekish's Khurasanian possessions unless the latter abandoned his threatening attitude towards the caliph. For his part, Tekish sought the help of the Qara-Khitai, and together they sent an army into Guzgan, threatening Firuzkuh and demanding of the Bamiyan Ghurids that they pay tribute for Balkh. Tekish himself marched against Herat, but in a battle on the Oxus banks the QaraKhitai were routed by the amirs of the Ghurids. Ghiyath al-Din and Mu'izz al-Din then took over Marv, Sarakhs, Nasa, Abivard, Tus, and Nishapur, and they installed in Marv Tekish's fugitive grandson Hindu. Khan. Finally Mu'izz al-Din conducted some operations in Kuhistan against the Isma'ilis, after which Khurasan was entrusted to a Ghurid prince, Diva' al-Din or 'Ala' al-Din Muhammad (597/1200).2
The Ghurids were unpopular among the people of Khurasan, and they found it hard to maintain their authority there. According to Juvaini, M u ' i z z a l - D i n i m p o s e d financial levies and confiscated p r o p e r ties in Tus, and carried off for his army grain which had been committed to the protection of the Imam 'All al-Rida's shrine. He was compelled to spend much of his time attending to the defence of these western conquests, especially as Ghiyath al-Din was becoming incapacitated by gout or rheumatism and eventually died in 599/1202.3 O n his brother's death, Mu'izz al-Din allotted various parts of the Ghurid empire to his relatives, with Ghur itself going to Diva' al-Din

QHAZNAVIDS AND QJSURIDS
Muhammad.1 The Khwarazm-Shah 'Ala' al-Din Muhammad came to besiege Herat; Mu'izz al-Din pursued him back into Khwarazm, but the flooding o f the K h w a r a z m i a n countryside m a d e p r o g r e s s i m p o s sible for the Ghurid troops. The shah also called in the Qara-Khitai once more, and a large army, whose commanders included Tayangu of Taraz and the Qarakhanid ruler of Samarqand, 'Uthman b. Ibrahim, joined Muhammad and drove the Ghurids out of Khwarazm; then, in a great battle at Andkhui on the Oxus, the Qara-Khitai routed Mu'izz al-Din (601/1204). Only the mediation of 'Uthman Khan, who did not want to see the Ghurid sultan captured by pagans, permitted Mu'izz al-Din's withdrawal to his own land. O f his for mer lands in Khurasan, only Herat remained to him, and he found it expedient to make peace with the Khwarazm-Shah even though the caliph continued to incite him against Muhammad, urging an alliance with the Qara-Khitai if this would further their design.2 The suppression of a revolt in the Punjab occupied Mu'izz al-Din's closing months, for on the way back to Ghazna he was assassinated, allegedly by emissaries of the Isma'ilis w h o m he had often persecuted during his lifetime (602/1206).3 Within a decade of his death the Ghurid empire fell apart, passing briefly into the hands of the Khwarazm-Shahs. The Ghurid forces comprised not only local Ghuri, Afghan, and Sagzi troops, but also the Turkish ghulams w h o were found in almost all eastern Islamic armies at this time. Mucizz al-Din's skill had kept all these elements together, but now the Turkish commanders in Ghazna and India began to act as an independent body. The dead sultan had no son of his o w n ; for his successor the Turkish troops inclined to his nephew Ghiyath alDin Mahmud b. Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad, whereas the Ghuri commanders favoured Baha' al-Din Sam of Bamiyan and then, after the latter's death, his two sons. In the end Ghiyath al-Din Mahmud prevailed, driving out the governor of Ghur, Diya' al-Din Muhammad, who was the candidate of the local Karamiyya adherents, and ascending the throne at Firuzkuh.4

However, the new sultan was inferior to his predecessors, and never managed to establish his direct authority over the eastern fringes of the Ghurid empire. The Turkish commander Taj al-Din Yildiz squashed the Bamiyan Ghurids' pretensions to rule in Ghazna, but only reluct antly and tardily did he recognize Ghiyath al-Din Mahmud.1 The latter dared not leave Ghur unprotected and march to Ghazna; the full measure of his clumsiness was seen when he called in the KhwarazmShah and Husain b. Kharmil, governor of Herat, to expel Yildiz from Ghazna and enforce his rights there (603/1206-7). The end of the Firuzkuh Ghurids was now near. Balkh and Tirmidh had both fallen to the Khwarazm-Shah, the latter being handed over to the QaraKhitai. The shah was defeated and temporarily held captive by the Qara-Khitai, but he returned to the attack and after a thirteen months' siege took Herat, the key to the Hari Rtid valley. His forces then in vaded Ghur and captured Ghiyath al-Din Mahmud (605/1208-9). The latter remained sultan, but only as the Khwarazm-Shah's puppet. He was assassinated either two or four years later, and his son Baha' alDin Sam was carried off to Khwarazm shortly afterwards. Ghazna was taken in 612/1215-16, Yildiz was driven into India, and the shah's son Jalal al-Din was installed as governor of Ghazna. In the same year the Bamiyan line of the Ghurids was extinguished, and Ghur now relapsed into an obscurity almost as deep as before.2
The "Ghurid interlude" in eastern Iranian history thus lasted for only a few decades, yet it constituted a remarkable achievement for the chieftains of such a remote corner of Afghanistan. The Ghurid sultans had drawn upon the manpower resources of their native Afghanistan as well as upon professional mercenaries from outside, and they had skilfully utilized Sunni religious sentiments in their struggles with the 'Abbasids' enemies, the Khwarazm-Shahs, and with the pagan QaraKhitai. Unfortunately for the Ghurids' ambitions, the resources which they could command, human and moral, did not prove quite enough for the double role in Khurasan and northern India which the sultans aspired to play.

THE END OF THE SALJUQS
XII. THE LAST D E C A D E S OF SALJUQ RULE IN THE WEST
The last forty years of Saljuq rule in Iraq and western Iran were characterized by three main trends, each of which was the accentuation of an earlier trend. First, the political and military influence of the 'Abbasid caliphate continued to rise. Second, the Turkish amirs and atabegs in the various provinces of the western Saljuq empire con solidated their power, in some cases forming hereditary lines. A n d finally, the real p o w e r o f the Saljuq sultans themselves, their dynasty now deeply disunited within itself and dependent on the military support of the Turkish amirs, continued to decline, and not even the despairing revival of activity on the part of Toghril b. Arslan, last of the sultans, could arrest this process and stave off total ruin. Hence the last decade of the 6th/12th century sees western Iran, the territory up to the edge of the Iraqi plain, incorporated into the vast empire which the Khwarazm-Shahs assembled on the eve of the Mongol invasions.
A s we have seen, Caliph al-Muqtafi began vigorously to assert the secular rights of his office (pp. 128-9 above). T w o centuries of Buyid and Saljuq control in Baghdad had fostered the idea that the caliph's p o w e r was purely spiritual, and that temporal affairs should be left to the amir or sultan w h o held the military and political supre macy at the time. This idea was n o w challenged. Ibn al-Athir sums up this novel trend in his obituary notice on al-Muqtafi:
He was the first Caliph to get sole power over Iraq, to the exclusion o f any Sultan, since the time when the Dailamis [the Buyids] first appeared. He was also the first Caliph to have firm control over the Caliphate and over his troops and retainers since the time when the slave troops secured an ascendancy over the Caliphs in al-Munstasir'js time [i.e. in the latter part of the 3rd/9th century] to the present day, with the possible exception of al-Muctadid's reign.1
Al-Muqtafi recruited troops extensively and was said to have a n e t w o r k o f spies and intelligence agents in all lands, w h i l e in the field of diplomacy he supported Turkish amirs in the provinces, e.g. the Eldigiizids in Azarbaijan, as a check on the Saljuq sultans. After the death of Mas'ud b. Muhammad the sultans were excluded from Baghdad; Mas'ud's shahna there, Mas'ud Bilali, was expelled when his master died, the caliph took over the sultan's palace and properties and henceforth no shahnas were tolerated in Baghdad.2 For much of

al-Muqtafi's reign and throughout the following one of al-Mustanjid (555-66/1160-70), the rights of the caliphate were strongly upheld by the viziers 'Aun al-Din Yahya Ibn Hubaira(d. 560/1165)and his son 'Izz al-Din (d. 5 61 /1166 or 562/1167). ' A u n al-Din was a staunch Hanbali, and his fiscal p o l i c y o f m a k i n g lands o n c e again directly taxable alienated those Shi'is whose shrines were in central Iraq.1 He was also a capable general, and in 549/1154, after he defeated the Turkish amirs and their protege Arslan b. Toghril, he was rewarded by the unusual honorifics of Sultan alJIraq (" Sultan o f I r a q " ) and Malik al-Juyush ( " M o n a r c h o f the Military Forces").2 With the accession of al-Nasir (575-622/1180-1225), the caliph b e c a m e a central figure in eastern Islamic d i p l o m a c y and politics. H e gave little attention to the west, leaving the struggle with the Crusaders to Saladin and the Ayyubids, but he was intensely concerned with such events in the East as the expansion of the Khwarazm-Shahs, w h o m he e n d e a v o u r e d t o c h e c k first t h r o u g h the G h u r i d s and then through the Mongols. O n the moral and ethical plain he made use of the futuwwa, or chivalric orders, becoming himself a member of the Rahhasiyya order in 578/1182-3. He reorganized these futuwwa bands and sought to enroll in them the rulers of the Islamic world, with himself as the head, thus linking together both Sunni and moderate Shfi elements. Rulers such as the Ayyubids, the R u m Saljuqs, and the Ghurids became affiliated with the Rahhasiyya order, and under alNasir's grandson al-Mustansir even the Khwarazm-Shah Jalal al-Din, son of al-Nasir's old enemy 'Ala' al-Din Muhammad, was admitted.3
A n event which caused a great sensation in the Islamic world was al-Nasir's success in securing the return of the Persian and Syrian Isma'ilis to the fold of orthodoxy. In 608/1211-12 the Grand Master of Alamut, Jalal al-Din Hasan III b. Muhammad, restored the practices of orthodox Islam in the regions under his control, building mosques, burning heretical books, and receiving from the caliph titles of honour such as no previous Grand Master had ever enjoyed. O n the Talisman Gate which he built at Baghdad the victorious caliph was depicted tearing apart the jaws of two dragons; the great epigraphist Max van

Berchem interpreted these dragons to represent the two great enemies of the caliphate, the Isma'ili Grand Master and the Khwarazm-Shah 'Ala' al-Din Muhammad.1 The death of Sultan Mas'ud without direct heir nevertheless left several Saljuq princes with claims to the sultanate, including his brother Sulaiman-Shah and the sons of his brothers Mahmud and Toghril. With the exception of Muhammad b. Mahmud, w h o m 'Imad al-Din praises as the most majestic, most learned, and most just of the Saljuqs,2 these contenders were of mediocre capability. They were almost wholly dependent on the Turkish amirs for support, since in this period several of the provincial amirs kept Saljuq princes at their courts, using them as shields for their o w n ambitions. Eldigiiz, atabeg o f A r r a n and o f part o f A z a r b a i j a n , at first p u s h e d the claims o f Malik-Shah b. Mahmud; but he also had with him Arslan b. Toghril, who was moreover the atabeg's own stepson—for Eldigiiz had married ToghriPs widow, and it was the children of this union, Pahlavan and Qizil-Arslan, w h o continued the line of the Eldigiizids.3 Ibn A q Sonqur, the Ahmadili Atabeg of Maragheh and Tabriz, likewise had with him a Saljuq prince, apparently a son of Muhammad b. Mahmud. Sulaiman-Shah b. Muhammad b. Malik-Shah was held prisoner for some time by the Zangid ruler of Mosul, Qutb al-Din Maudud, until he was released t o r e i g n for a brief p e r i o d in H a m a d a n as sultan (5 5 5 - 6 / 1 1 6 0 - 1 ) . O n the death of Malik-Shah b. Mahmud, his son Mahmud was taken by his supporters to Fars, where the Salghurid atabeg Muzaffar al-Din Zangi seized him and held him at Istakhr as a possible claimant.4
The north-western provinces of Iran remained quite outside the sultans' sphere of direct influence. Power here was divided between the Eldigiizids and the Ahmadilis. Shams al-Din Eldigiiz (d. 5 70/1174-5 or possibly 571/1175-6) was originally a slave of Sultan Mahmud's vizier, al-Kamal al-Simirumi; then he passed into the possession of

Sultan Mas'ud, who appointed him governor of Arran.1 For some time he kept aloof from the quarrels over the sultanate, until the fortunate marriage which he had made with Toghril's widow Mu'mina Khatun enabled him to champion the succession of Arslan b. Toghril; the latter he duly set up at Hamadan on the murder o f Sulaiman-Shah in 556/1161.2 His son Nusrat al-Din Pahlavan Muhammad was Sultan Arslan's half-brother, and Pahlavan succeeded not only to the paternal territories in Arran and much of Azarbaijan, but also to Jibal, Isfahan, and Ray, with his brother Qizil-Arslan 'Uthman ruling in Tabriz as his subordinate. Pahlavan held Arslan and his young son and successor T o g h r i l u n d e r close tutelage until his death c. 5 8 1 / 1 1 8 6 . O n l y w i t h Qizil-Arslan's rule did Toghril manage to burst out of this constriction, and after the Eldigiizid's murder in 5 87/1191 he briefly turned the tables on Qizil-Arslan's successor, Qutlugh Inanj b. Pahlavan. The E l d i g u z i d line did not, h o w e v e r , s u r v i v e b e y o n d the first quarter o f the 7th/13th century. For much of Iran, the irruption of the KhwarazmShahs marked the end of an epoch, and in 622/1225 Sultan Jalal al-Din finally d e p o s e d O z - B e g b . P a h l a v a n . 3 T h u s the historical significance o f the E l d i g i i z i d s lies, first, in their virtually undisputed rule o v e r m u c h o f north-western Iran for several decades (just before his death QizilArslan was even bold enough to claim the sultanate for himself);4 and second, in their role as champions of Muslim arms on the north eastern frontier, where they faced the resurgent power of the Georgian kings (see pp. 178-9 below).
The Ahmadilis of Maragheh took their name from the Rawwadid Ahmadil b. Ibrahim of Tabriz, w h o was murdered in 510/1116.5 In accordance with the prevalent practice, his Turkish slave Aq-Sonqur took the surname of his master's family, Ahmadili, and founded a line which endured in Maragheh for over a century, until, like the Eldigiizids, it was extinguished by the Khwarazm-Shahs. Aq-Sonqur became atabeg to D a ' u d b. Mahmud and supported his brief tenure as sultan in Azarbaijan and Jibal in 525-6/1131-2. The name of his son and successor is somewhat uncertain, but in the sources he is often
1 Minorsky has pointed out (BS.O.AS. [1949-50], p. 877) that the date 568/1172-$which Ibn al-Athir gives as the year of Eldiguz's death—is wrong; the correct date is either that of Husaini (570) or of Fariqi and Ravandi (571), and probably the latter. 2 Zahir al-Din Nishapuri, p. 75; Ibn al-Athir, vol. xi, pp. 175-7, 255-6. 3 See Houtsma, "Ildegiz" and "Tughril II b.

called Aq-Sonqur; he now became the Eldigiizids' rival for power in the north-west. Whereas Eldigiiz pressed the claims of Arslan b. Toghril, Aq-Sonqur II was in 554/1159 entrusted with the infant son of Muhammad b. Mas'ud; he refused to recognize the succession of Arslan in 556/1160, and the Caliph's vizier cAun al-Din Ibn Hubaira incited him to set up as a rival the Saljuq child w h o m he had in his keeping.1 Falak al-Din b. Aq-Sonqur II lost Tabriz in 5 70/1174-5 to Pahlavan b. Eldigiiz, and conflict between the two families persisted into the next century. The Ahmadili 'Ala' al-Din Qara-Sonqur or Korp-Arslan, patron of the poet Nizami, attempted in 602/1205-6 to despose the drunk and incompetent Eldigiizid Nusrat al-Din Abu. Bakr b. Pahlavan, but the latter reacted with unwonted vigour and captured Maragheh from 'Ala' al-Din, allotting him in exchange Urmiyeh and Ishnu. When in 605/1208-9 'Ala' al-Din's infant son and successor died, almost all the Ahmadili lands fell to Abu. Bakr, although scions of the family are still heard of after the engulfing waves of the K h w a r azm-Shahs and Mongols had passed over Azarbaijan.2
In Armenia the Shah-Armanids, descendants of the ghulam Sukman al-Qutbi, were frequently involved in the politics and warfare of Azarbaijan, tending to take the side of Aq-Sonqur II against the Eldigiizids. But when Nasr al-Din Sukman died without heir in 581/ 1185, a bloodless struggle for power took place between Pahlavan b. Eldigiiz, who had married a daughter to the aged Shah-Arman in order to acquire a succession claim, and the Ayyubid Saladin. In the end, Pahlavan took over Akhlat, whilst Saladin annexed Mayyafariqin in Diyarbakr, a possession of the Artuqids of Mardin which had been latterly under the protectorship of the Shah-Arman.3 Mosul and the Jazireh remained under Zangid rule, although the relentless advance of Saladin into the Jazireh posed a serious threat to the Zangids, driving the last Shah-Arman and the atabeg cIzz al-Din Mas'iid b. Qutb al-Din Maudud into alliance against Ayyubid aggression.4 After the death of Saladin in 589/1193, the Zangids recaptured most of the towns and fortresses of the Jazireh.

control in Khûzistân.1 Between 553/1158 and 556/1161, Malik-Shâh b. Muhammad took from him part of Khûzistân, but thereafter it reverted entirely to Shumla, w h o held it till his death in battle against Eldiguzid forces. O n two occasions, in 526/1167 and 569/1173-4, Shumla had tried to encroach on caliphal territory in Iraq, but was repulsed by forces from Baghdad; in 564/1169 he temporarily occupied Fârs at the invitation of the army of the Salghurid ruler of Fârs, Muzaffar al-Din Zangi, who had become unpopular for his tyranny.2 Like other provincial amirs, Shumla sheltered a Saljuq prince, the son of MalikShâh b. Mahmûd, and after Shumla's death this prince continued to harry the borders of Iraq. One of Shumla's sons reigned in Khûzistân for a further twenty years till his death in 591/1195, when al-Nâsir's vizier Mu'ayyid al-Din Ibn Qassâb invaded the province, annexing it and carrying off Shumla's grandsons to Baghdad. The caliph then appointed ghulâm commanders to rule Khûzistân, but in 603/1206-7 he was faced with a rebellion there of one of his former ghulâms, w h o had built up a coalition of local Kurdish chiefs, the Salghurid ruler of Fârs, 'Izz al-Din Sa'd, and the former Eldigûzid ghulâm Ai-Toghmïsh, now ruler of Ray, Isfahan, and Hamadân. The threat was surmounted, but the caliph had to suppress a further revolt in Khûzistân in 607/ 1210-11.3 In Fârs the Salghurid family o f Atabegs ruled for some 120 years as tributaries first o f the Saljuqs, then o f the K h w â r a z m - S h a h s , and then of the Mongols. They were of Turkmen origin, and the Salghur (or Salur) tribe seems to have played an important role in the establishment of the Saljuq sultanate of Rûm. T h e line of atabegs is usually said to start in 543/1148 with Muzaffar al-Din Sonqur, w h o took advantage of the troubles of Sultan Mas'ûd b. Muhammad by extending his power over Fârs; the sources state that Sonqur was a nephew of the previous ruler in Fârs, Boz-Aba, though this affiliation is uncertain. Sonqur's son Zangi (d. 570/1174-5) was confirmed in Fârs by Sultan Arslan b. Toghril, and the province seems to have enjoyed a moderate prosperity u n d e r his rule ; b u t the real florescence o f this m i n o r dynasty came in

the reign of 'Izz al-Din Sa'd (590-628/1194-1231). It was from this ruler that the p o e t Sa'di derived his takhallus {nom de plume), his father having been in the atabeg's service. After an eight-year struggle with his cousin Toghril, Sa'd had to restore internal prosperity to his devastated province; he subdued the Shabankara'i Kurds and attacked K i r m a n , b u t finally had t o submit t o the K h w a r a z m - S h a h ' A l a ' alD i n Muhammad and to cede part o f his territory to him (see p. 184 below).1 Just as the rebellion of the G h u z z in Khurasan led directly to the decline and disappearance of Saljuq power in that province, so the irruption of these nomads into Kirman brought about the end of the local Saljuq dynasty there. In 582/1186 the last Saljuq of Kirman, M u h a m m a d Shah b . Bahram-Shah, fled before the G h u z z leader M a l i k Dinar; yet for some years before that the Saljuq family in Kirman had been seriously weakened by internecine conflict, for Toghril-Shah b. Muhammad2 left four sons, Bahram-Shah, Arslan-Shah, Turan-Shah, and Terken-Shah, all of w h o m except the last subsequently achieved the throne.3 Bahram-Shah ruled in Jiruft from 565/1169-70 to 570/1174-5, proclaimed ruler there by the eunuch atabeg Mu'ayyid al-Din Raihan, in whose hands lay much of the real power. But the other important town of Bardasir, was held by Qutb al-Din Muhammad (son of an earlier and now displaced atabeg, Boz-Qush), who eventually espoused the cause of Arslan-Shah when he made a bid for the throne. O n his behalf Turan-Shah also appeared from Fars with forces supplied by the Salghurid Zangi. Bahram-Shah got aid from Mu'ayyid al-Din Ai-Aba in Nishapur, but Arslan-Shah returned to the attack, this time with forces lent by Sultan Arslan b. Toghril and the atabeg Eldigiiz, In the end, Arslan-Shah and Bahram-Shah agreed to partition Kirman between them, the former to have two thirds and the latter to have the eastern third of the province.4 Both were in fact dead by 572/1176-7, and the third brother Turan

Shah came to the throne for a seven years' reign (572/1176-7 to 579/ 1183-4). His reign, too, was stormy; at the outset the Salghurid Zangi allied with the atabeg Muhammad b. Boz-Qush to force Turan-Shah off the throne, and shortly afterwards a force of G h u z z invaded Kirman penetrating as far as Makran and Fars. Expelled from the Sarakhs area of Khurasan by the Khwarazm-Shah's brother Sultan-Shah, these G h u z z comprised 5,000 m o u n t e d m e n plus their dependants. T h e i r arrival threw Kirman into chaos, and their own depredations together w i t h the n i b b l i n g o f their flocks b r o u g h t e c o n o m i c dislocation and then famine. T h e trading suburb o r rabad o f Bardasir, o n c e an inter national resort for merchants and caravans, was destroyed, and never in this period did it revive. Kirman now became the base for Ghuzz raids as far as Isfahan, Fars, and Sistan.1 Turan-Shah's nephew and successor Muhammad-Shah (579-82/1183-6) found the old centre of Bardasir too stricken by ruin and famine to serve as his capital, so he transferred to Bam. Nevertheless he was unable to withstand the pressure of the Ghuzz, and in the end he abandoned Kirman, seeking help first in Fars and Iraq and then f r o m T e k i s h in K h u r a s a n . D e s p a i r i n g o f r e c o v e r i n g K i r m a n , M u h a m m a d - S h a h finished his days in the service of the Ghurids.2 Kirman was now fully in the hands of the Ghuzz leader Malik Dinar, w h o had come there in 582/1186 from Nishapur after the death of Toghan-Shah b. Ai-Aba (p. 190 below).3 A s ruler of Kirman, Malik Dinar showed statesmanship and foresight; he took measures for the restoration of agricultural and economic prosperity, conciliated the ulema, and tried to legitimize his rule by marrying a Saljuq princess, the daughter of Toghril-Shah. He led expeditions against the local rulers of Hormuz and the island of Qais and made them his tributaries. When Malik Dinar died in 5 91/1195, his incompetent son FarrukhShah was unable to control the G h u z z , and as a ruling force the horde now disintegrated. Farrukh-Shah had been ready to recognize the suzerainty of the Khwarazm-Shahs, by then the greatest single power in Iran, and after his death in 592/1196 Tekish's authority was estab lished in Kirman through the agency of the atabeg Nusrat al-Din b. Muhammad Oner. Faced by a powerful Khwarazmian army, the Ghuzz of Kirman gave up the attempt to retain their power there and

abandoned the province, entering the ranks o f the K h w a r a z m i a n armyafter a twenty-year domination of Kirman.1 Thus in the second half of the 6th/12th century, the Saljuqs of Iraq and western Iran ruled no more than the province of Jibal; Hamadan and Isfahan were the centres of their power, though they did have occasional control over Ray. When the fugitive Sulaiman-Shah came in 550/1155 to Baghdad, Caliph al-Muqtafi recognized him as sultan but required in return that Sulaiman-Shah should never make any hostile move against Iraq; and after the failure of Sultan Muham mad's siege of Baghdad in 5 51-2/1157, the sultans never again seriously tried to assert their former authority there.2 O n the death in 547/115 2 of Sultan Mas'ud, the AmirKhass Beg Arslan, in accordance with the dead monarch's wishes, proclaimed Malik-Shah b. Mahmud as his successor. Al-Muqtafi seized the opportunity for a great onslaught on Saljuq authority in Iraq. Mas'ud's old shahna in Baghdad, Mas'ud Bilali, was driven out, the sultan's properties ex propriated, and even poets attached to the Saljuq court circle, including the famous Hais-Bais, were arrested, whilst caliphal forces took over the outlying towns of Hilla, Kufa, and Wash.3 Malik-Shah was allowed to reign only for a few months, and in 548/115 3 he was replaced by his brother Muhammad, who was brought from Khuzistan. During his six years as sultan, Muhammad tried energetically to restore the slipping authority of his dynasty in Iraq. The caliph was at this time clearing Iraq of the remaining Turkish elements, w h o had rallied round Mas'ud Bilali in Takrit. These amirs brought out from captivity in Takrit the young Saljuq prince Arslan, and set him up as sultan; according to 'Imad al-Din, the commanders had said to Mas'ud Bilali, "Fetch Malik Arslan b. Toghril, the Sultan's nephew, so that the troops and the Turkmen contingents may take heart f r o m his presence " . A t first forced b a c k o n B a g h d a d , the caliph assembled an army o f Arabs and Kurds, and with his vizier, c A u n alDin Ibn Hubaira, he led them in 549/1154 to victory at Bazimza near Baghdad against Mas'ud Bilali, Al-Qush, and their protege Arslan.

T h e latter fled into K u r d i s t a n a n d eventually f o u n d shelter w i t h his stepfather Eldigiiz.1 The Saljuq prince Sulaiman-Shah b. Muhammad Tapar had been his uncle Sanjar's heir in Khurasan, but the ascendancy of the G h u z z drove him westwards, and in 550/1155 he appeared at Baghdad with a small force. Al-Muqtafi saw in him a useful weapon against Sultan Muhammad, and he recognized Sulaiman-Shah as a rival sultan, placing his name in the khutba. He also provided him with an army, but his bid for power in Jibal was easily defeated by Muhammad. T h e latter was naturally incensed at the caliph's aid to his rival, and he summoned all his forces for a siege of Baghdad in 551-2/1157. A s well as the Saljuq army from Hamadan, Zangid forces under Zain al-Din 'Ali Kiichuk came from Mosul, and contingents came from the M a z y a d i d s in Hilla and f r o m southern Iraq. H e a v y fighting, both on land and on the rivers, followed. Ibn Hubaira had laid in good stocks of food for the army, but the interruptions to commerce made the spirits o f B a g h d a d ' s merchant classes flag. T h e v i z i e r distributed money and presents amongst the besiegers, together with skilful propaganda about the impiety of attacking the caliph; he also wrote to Eldigiiz inciting him to make a countermove in Jibal and to set up there a Saljuq prince as rival to Muhammad. This diplomacy had its effect. T h e army of Mosul grew lukewarm, and when Muhammad received the news that Eldigiiz had come with the princes Arslan and Malik-Shah and had occupied the capital Hamadan, he lifted the siege. He drove Eldigiiz back into Azarbaijan and cleared his partisans from Ray and Isfahan, but by now he was a sick man. He was unable to consummate his marriage with the daughter of Muhammad b. ArslanShah of Kirman, and remained in Hamadan till his death in 554/1159 at the age of thirty-two.2
There was dissension among the amirs regarding a successor. Muhammad's own infant son was committed to the Ahmadili A q Sonqur II at Maragheh. Some amirs favoured Malik-Shah b. Mahmud, to w h o m Muhammad had latterly allocated the province of Fars; and though he managed to conquer part of this from Shumla, he died at

Isfahan in 555/1160, reputedly poisoned by the Vizier Ibn Hubaira, for Malik-Shah had been threatening to march against the caliph in Baghdad.1 Others supported Arslan b. Toghril, but a majority, in cluding Inanch Sonqur, the powerful governor of Ray, favoured Sulaiman-Shah on grounds of seniority and acceptability to al-Muqtaf i. Saulaiman-Shah was accordingly released from captivity at Mosul, and with difficulty established himself at Hamadan. He reigned for a few months only in the year 5 5 5/1160, during which time he leant heavily on the support of such amirs as Inanch Sonqur and Sharaf al-Din Gird-Bazu, while from fear of Eldigiiz he was compelled to invest Arslan with the governorship of Arran and make him his heir. Sulai man-Shah dreamed of re-establishing Saljuq influence in Baghdad by the appointment there of a shahna, but the negotiations with alMustanjid were inconclusive. Sulaiman-Shah's drunkenness and general ineffectiveness soon lost him the amirs' support. They invited Eldigiiz to set up Arslan as sultan; Gird-Bazu. arrested Sulaiman-Shah, w h o w a s first imprisoned and then in 5 5 6 / 1 1 6 1 strangled w i t h a b o w s t r i n g . 2 In this fashion Arslan was installed at Hamadan in 556/1161 as nominal sultan. He remained under the tutelage of Eldigiiz, w h o took the title o f Atabeg al-A\am (" S u p r e m e A t a b e g " ) and his v i z i e r w a s Shihab al-Din Muhammad Nishapuri, formerly minister to InanchSonqur of Ray. Arslan now married Muhammad's widow, the Khatun-i Kirmani.3 This succession was nevertheless disputed. Inanch of Ray was temporarily mollified by the marriage of his daughter to Pahlavan b. Eldigiiz, but the caliph refused to recognize Arslan as sultan, fearing the constitution of a powerful Saljuq-Eldigiizid state in western Iran. His vizier stirred up Aq-Sonqor II Ahmadili, w h o had with him the son of Muhammad b. Mahmud, and Aq-Sonqur in alliance with the Shah-Arman of Akhlat routed the army of Pahlavan on the banks of the Safid Rud. Ibn Hubaira further encouraged the Salghurid Zangi in Shlraz to press the succession claims of Mahmud b. Malik-Shah b. Mahmud.4 A coalition of discontented amirs, including Inanch-Sonqur, Tzz al-Din Satmaz, and Alp-Arghun of Qazvin, marched on Hamadan,

but in a battle at Marg-i Qara-Tegin they were defeated by Sultan A r s l a n , E l d i g i i z , and G i r d - B a z u . I n a n c h fled first t o the B a v a n d i d Caspian territories and then to the Khwarazm-Shah U-Arslan. Despite the support of a Khwarazmian army, his invasion of the Q a z v i n Zanjan area proved a failure, and the excesses of his troops alienated the local people (562/1166-7). Inanch then took refuge in Gurgan, returning later with Bavandid support, and this time recapturing Ray. But Eldigiiz came in 564/1169 with an army to besiege Inanch in the citadel of Tabarak, after which he suborned some of Inanch's ghulams to kill him. Ray was then granted to Pahlavan, with the Vizier Sa'd al-Din al-Ashall left there to administer it.1 Eldigiiz's diplomatic and military activity reached well beyond the borders of his territories of Azarbaijan and Jibal. Mu'ayyid al-Din A i A b a of Khurasan had long been one of Eldigiiz's friends, and in 558/ 1163 he placed Sultan Arslan in the khutba of the towns in his posses sion. Therefore in 562/1167, when Khwarazmian pressure seemed to be uncomfortably close, it was natural that Ai-Aba should write to Eldigiiz, warning him of Il-Arslan's ambitions not merely in Khurasan but in the whole of Iran; Eldigiiz wrote to the shah warning him that Khurasan was part of Sultan Arslan's territories, and he came himself to Bistam to check a Khwarazmian move against Khurasan.2 In 563/ 1168 Pahlavan led an army against the Ahmadilis and forced them to make peace; Eldigiiz sent to Mosul and had Qutb al-Din Maudud read the khutba for Arslan, and in 564/1169 he sent an army to Kirman to aid the claimant Arslan-Shah.3 The defence of the north-west was one of Eldigiiz's particular concerns, for the period of the Eldigiizids in Azarbaijan coincided with a phase of renewed activity by the Bagratid kings of Christian Georgia. Under Dmitri (1125-54 or 1156), the Georgian monarchy was largely occupied with internal struggles against the Orbeliani family of nobles, but in 549/1154, apparently at the invitation of the local Shaddadid ruler Fakhr al-Din Shaddad, the Georgians descended on Ani and defeated and captured 'Izz al-Din Saltuq of Erzerum.4 The reign of

Dmitri's son Giorgi III (1156-84) was one of internal prosperity and warfare against the Muslims. In 556/1161 Ani passed from Fadl I V b. Mahmiid to the Christians, and in the next year a Georgian army took Dvin. These successes provoked a grand Muslim coalition of Sultan Arslan, Eldigiiz, Aq-Sonqur Ahmadili, and the Shah-Arman Sukman b. Ibrahim, which in 557/1162 invaded Georgia and defeated K i n g Giorgi.1 Eldigiiz's efforts gradually slowed d o w n Georgian expansion, t h o u g h w e still find the Christians raiding as far as Ganja in 561/1166 and even intervening at Darband to assist the Shir vanShah Akhsitan, who was related by marriage to the Bagratids.2 Under Queen Tamara (1184-1212) the dynamism of the Georgians reached its peak. G u i d e d b y her Amtr-Spasalari (Commander-in-Chief) Zakharia Mkhargrdzeli and his brother the " atabeg" Ioanne, she deliberately diverted attention from internal questions by directing Georgian energies outwards. The later Eldigiizids were not of the calibre of Eldigiiz and Pahlavan. In the succession struggles amongst the latter's sons, A m i r A m i r a n ' U m a r fled at one p o i n t t o Q u e e n Tamara, and from her and her vassal the Shirvan-Shah he received help against his brother Abu. Bakr. Later realizing that he could not stand up to Georgian arms, Abu. Bakr contracted a marriage with a Georgian princess in order to safeguard his position.3 In the succeeding years the Georgians took Dvin, Kars and Ardabil; they operated in the west without hindrance as far as Malazgird, Akhlat, Arjish, and Erzerum, eventually coming up against the Saljuqs of R u m ; and after 600/1204 Tamara gave aid to the fugitive Comneni in Trebizond. Most of these conquests were not held for very long, and though Giorgi I V (1212-23) continued to draw tribute from Erzerum, Ganja, Nakhchivan, and Akhlat, the Mongols appeared in the Caucasus in 617/1220 and a period of disaster began for the Georgians.4 When Eldigiiz died at Nakhchivan in 570/1174-5 or 571/1175, his son Pahlavan Muhammad succeeded to his position as atabeg. Sultan Arslan had long resented his subordination to Eldigiiz, and it seems that at this juncture he endeavoured to break away from Eldigiizid

control. Some discontented amirs having provided him with money and troops, he moved to Zanjan intending to conquer Azarbaijan; but in 5 71/1176, at the age of forty-three, he fell ill and died. 'Irnad al-Din asserts—and it is not improbable—that Pahlavan had conveniently poisoned the sultan. Pahlavan n o w set up Arslan's young son Toghril as sultan, and successfully fought off an attempt to seize the throne, made by Arslan's elder brother Muhammad, who had been living in Khuzistan.1 Pahlavan died in 582/1186, and in accordance with the Turkish practice of seniorate his position as atabeg fell to his childless brother Qizil-Arslan 'Uthman. But Pahlavan also divided his personal territories among his four sons, w h o were to be under Qizil-Arslan's general supervision, and this partition was to prove a source of dissension and weakness. Pahlavan's wife Inanch Khatun, daughter of InanchSonqur of Ray, supported the claims of her two sons against the other two children, sons of Pahlavan by slave mothers; one of these latter, Abu. Bakr, was particularly favoured by Qizil-Arslan and seemed likely to succeed, as in fact he did, to the whole of the Eldigiizid inheritance.2 T h e new Sultan Toghril, last of the Saljuqs in Iran, is praised in the sources for his manifold qualities, scholarly as well as soldierly. H e soon became restive under Qizil-Arslan's tutelage, for whereas he had been on good terms with Pahlavan, the new atabeg treated him harshly.3 Toghril allied with the forces supporting Inanch Khatun's son Qutlugh Inanch Muhammad in opposition to Qizil-Arslan and A b u Bakr. In 583/1187 he was in Mazandaran seeking help from the Bavandid Husam al-Daula Ardashir. Also in this year he sent an envoy to Baghdad asking that the old palace of the Saljuq sultans be repaired in order that he might occupy it. Al-Nasir's answer was to raze the palace to the ground and to send an army of 15,000 troops, under his vizier Jalal al-Din 'Ubaidallah b. Yunus, to support QizilArslan, who agreed to become the caliph's direct vassal. Toghril defeated the caliphal forces at Dai-Marg near Hamadan in 584/1188, but he lost support by his arbitrary behaviour and his execution of opponents in Hamadan. Qizil-Arslan n o w set up Sanjar b. SulaimanShah as a rival sultan and drove Toghril into the Lake Urmiyeh

region; and though he tried despairingly to obtain help from the Ayyubid Saladin and to conciliate the caliph, even sending one of his infant sons to Baghdad as a hostage, Toghril was obliged in 586/1190 to surrender to Qizil-Arslan, who imprisoned him and his son MalikShah in a castle near Tabriz.1 Qizil-Arslan now claimed the sultanate for himself, assuming the appropriate style and privileges; but in the next year he was mys teriously murdered, possibly by one of his own amirs, possibly by Inanch Khatun, w h o m Qizil-Arslan had married on his brother's death. Toghril's subsequent execution of Inanch Khatun may point to the second alternative.2 After two years' incarceration, Toghril was released by one of the amirs of Azarbaijan. Near Qazvin he speedily defeated Inanch Khatun's two sons, Qutlugh-Inanch and the AmirAmiran 'Umar, and drove them into Azarbaijan (588/1192). There they were again defeated, this time by their half-brother A b u Bakr w h o was then at Nakhchivan, but they later returned with help from Georgia and Arran and defeated A b u Bakr. Toghril was now master of Jibal, Hamadan, and Isfahan, and he had also secured the treasuries left by Pahlavan. But an enemy more dangerous than the Eldiguzids had meanwhile appeared.3 Qutlugh-Inanch had summoned help from the Khwarazm- Shah Tekish, who in 588/1192 came to Mazandaran and then Ray, and demanded that the khutba of western Iran recognize his name im mediately after that of the caliph. After this was granted, however, he was obliged to return to Khurasan on receiving news of a projected attack on Khwarazm by his brother Sultan-Shah. Tekish therefore made peace with Toghril, but the sultan felt that a Khwarazmian army in Ray, with its commanding position of the roads into Jibal and Azarbaijan, was a threat which could not be endured; and no doubt he felt too that his prestige was involved. Tekish had distractions in Khurasan, and does not seem at this point to have been implacably hostile towards Toghril, despite urgings from Caliph al-Nasir. In 589/1193 Toghril marched eastwards and cleared the Khwarazm

ian garrison out of Ray; and in the following year he defeated Qutlugh-Inanch there, despite the 7,000 Khwarazmian reinforcements which the Eldigiizid had obtained from Damghan. Tekish returned to Ray in 590/1194. Against the advice of his amirs, Toghril refused to withdraw and negotiate a peace, or even to wait for additional troops to come up from Isfahan and Zanjan. In a battle outside Ray the Saljuq army was defeated and Toghril killed at the age of twenty-five, his head being sent by Tekish to Baghdad. In this fashion, the sources note, the Saljuq dynasty ended as it began, with a Toghril; though in fact two of the dead sultan's sons remained in the custody of the Khwarazm-Shahs till their execution at the time of the M o n g o l invasion of Khwarazm in 616/1219-20, and a daughter of Toghril survived to marry first the E l d i g i i z i d O z - B e g b . P a h l a v a n and then the K h w a r a z m Shah Jalal al-Din himself.1
Tekish occupied Hamadan and the whole of Jibal, making QutlughInanch governor over it, but much of the land was divided into iqta's for his amirs, and he left his sons Yunus K h a n and Muhammad K h a n i n c o n t r o l . 2 It w a s readily predictable that the caliph w o u l d find the proximity of Tekish uncomfortable, and deep mutual suspicion arose. Al-Nasir's vizier, Mu'ayyid al-Din Ibn al-Qassab, had taken over Khuzistan on the death of Shumla's son, and in 591/1195 was joined there by Qutlugh-Inanch, w h o had quarrelled with the Khwarazmian Commander-in-Chief Shams al-Din Mayanchuq. The two of them invaded Jibal and drove the Khwarazm-Shah's son from Hamadan and then Ray into Qumis and Gurgan. Returning to Hamadan in 592/1196, Tekish disinterred and mutilated the body of Ibn al-Qassab; but disorder in his territories on the lower Syr Darya compelled his withdrawal once more (see p. 19I below).3
The caliph judged it wise to b o w in some degree to the military superiority of the shah, and in 595/1199 he sent to Tekish an investiture patent for the sultanate of Iraq, Khurasan, and Turkestan. Reports about Mayanchuq's misconduct brought Tekish westwards once again

in this same year, and after the rebellious governor had been pursued into Dailam and defeated, the shah turned to attack the Isma'ilis there, capturing the fortress of Arslan-Gushai near Qazvin.1 In all these campaigns the Khwarazmian army included a large proportion of Turkmen troops from the Qipchaq steppes, many of w h o m were still pagan; the army became hated in western Iran for its violence and rapine, which Ravandi says were worse than the excesses of the Christ ian Georgians and Franks and even of the pagan Qara-Khitai. When in 596/1200 Tekish died, the people of Jibal rose and massacred all the Khwarazmians they could find.2 Al-Nasir now agreed to partition western Iran between himself and Nur al-Din Gokche, a former Eldigiizid ghulam who had taken over Ray, Saveh, Qum, and Kashan; the caliph was to have Isfahan, Hamadan, Qazvin, and Zanjan.3 Thus the nominal authority of the Eldigiizids survived in northern Jibal and Dailam, and when in 600/1203-4 Gokche was killed in battle with another of Pahlavan's old ghulams, Shams al-Din Ai-Toghmish, the latter set up O z - B e g b. Pahlavan as titular ruler of Gokche's territories. In Azarbaijan, Abu. Bakr b. Pahlavan held on and secured a reputation with posterity for his patronage of scholars and his foundation of mosques and madrasas. With Ai-Toghmish's aid in 602/1205-6 he fought off an attack by the Ahmadili ruler of Maragheh, 'Ala' al-Din Qara-Sonqur, and three years later he took over almost all the Ahmadili possessions (see above, pp. 170-1).4 The Eldigiizid ghulams remained a potent force in Jibal and in 608/1211-12 a further upheaval took place in which Ai-Toghmish was replaced by Mengli. Mengli's power soon excited the fears of neighbouring powers, however, and in 612/1215-16 the caliph organ ized a grand coalition against him, including Oz-Beg, the amirs of al-Jazireh and Kurdistan, and the Isma'ili Grand Master Hasan III, newly returned to the fold of orthodoxy (see p. 168 above). Mengli was defeated in battle and eventually executed by Oz-Beg, w h o now appointed the ghulam Saif al-Din Ighlamish as governor of Jibal.5 Tekish was followed as Khwarazm-Shah by his son 'Ala' al-Din Muhammad. A t the end of his life Tekish had demanded of al-Nasir

that his son's name be put in the khutba at Baghdad, but for many years his successor was too occupied with his opponents the Ghurids, the Qara-Khitai, and the Qipchaq to contemplate expansion in the west. However, in 614/1217, on the very eve of the Mongol invasion, 'Ala' al-Din Muhammad demanded recognition by the caliph and came westwards. Ighlamish in Jibal recognized him, but was shortly afterwards murdered by an Isma'ili assassin. The Salghurid atabeg Sa'd b. Zangi, seeing a chance to add Jibal to his existing province of Fars, marched on Ray only to meet defeat and capture at the hands of the Khwarazmian army. He was forced to pay a tribute of a third of his annual revenues for the rest of his life, and to allot certain of his territories as fiefs for K h w a r a z m i a n c o m m a n d e r s . In return, S a ' d w a s given a Khwarazmian bride together with help to recover his province, for in his absence his son A b u Bakr Qutlugh K h a n had taken over Fars; later one of Sard's daughters was to marry Sultan Jalal al-Din.1 'Ala' al-Din Muhammad knew from captured diplomatic corre spondence that the caliph had in the past incited the Ghurids against him and was n o w using Isma'ili assassins to remove his opponents.2 Because of his anti-caliphal attitude he was unable to count on Sunni opinion, and so the shah adopted a pro-Shi'i policy. He secured a fatwa from the religious authorities of his empire saying that alNasir was unfit to rule and that the 'Abbasids had usurped the caliphate from the house of 'All, and he proclaimed the Sayyid 'Ala' al-Mulk Tirmidhi as Anti-Caliph. H e began a march on Baghdad, but in the winter of 614/1217-18 snowstorms of unparalleled ferocity, together with harrying by hostile Turkmen and Hakkari Kurds, halted him on the borders of Iraq and Iran. Hearing of the Mongols' appearance in the east, the shah returned to Khurasan, leaving his son Rukn al-Din Ghur-Sanji with the care of eastern Iran.3

KHURASAN AND THE KH WARAZM-&H AH S
XIIL KHURASAN IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE 6TH/l2TH
CENTURY, AND THE EXPANSION OF THE KHWARAZM-SHAHS
After Sanjar's death in 552/1157, Khurasan remained politically frag mented. For despite the authority which should have come to him when Sanjar nominated him as heir, the Qarakhanid M a h m u d K h a n was never able to enjoy more than a limited authority. Amongst the former g h u l a m s o f Sanjar's a r m y the m o s t p o w e r f u l single figure w a s Mu'ayyid al-Din Ai-Aba of Nishapur. Mahmud Khan, unable singlehanded to make much headway against him, allied with Ai-Aba, confirmed him in the governorship of Nishapur and Tiis, and fell more and more under his influence.1 The end of the eastern branch of the Saljuqs left a power vacuum in Khurasan, and this inevitably invited the intervention of external powers such as the ambitious Bavandid Shah Ghazi Rustam (534-58/1140-63) and the Khwarazm-Shah Taj a l - D u n y a w a ' l - D i n Il-Arslan (5 51—68/1156—72). T h e internal politics o f Khurasan were for twenty years dominated by the disputes of the Turkish amirs and the Ghuzz tribesmen, with the Khwarazm-Shahs stepping in only so far as their dependence on the Qara-Khitai allowed. But after the capture of Herat by the Ghurids in 5 7 1 / 1 1 7 5 - 6 , a new major power appeared in the province, and down to the last decade of the century there was a three-cornered struggle for hegemony in Khurasan involving the Ghurids, the Khwarazm-Shah Tekish, and his estranged brother Sultan-Shah. Squeezed among these combatants, the Ghuzz tribesmen were either compelled to migrate to adjacent regions such as Kirman, or else they were absorbed into the Khwarazmian and GhQrid armies. In the rivalry after Sanjar's death between A i - A b a and Ikhtiyar alDin Ai-Taq, the latter received help from Shah Ghazi Rustam (p. 156 above). Ai-Taq collected an army in Mazandaran, but was defeated by Ai-Aba and Mahmud Khan. A peace between the two sides in 553/1158 freed Ai-Aba to deal with Sonqur 'Azizi, another of Sanjar's former ghulams, who had rebelled in Herat during Ai-Aba's preoccupation with Ai-Taq. Ai-Aba and Mahmud Khan then attempted to subdue the independent Turkmen bands who were established in several parts of Khurasan, but found this an uphill task; they were defeated by the Ghuzz, w h o followed up this victory by occupying Marv and then raiding Ai-Aba's towns of Sarakhs and Tiis. The Ghuzz now

offered their allegiance to Mahmud, and the khan, although personally distrustful of the Turkmen, saw a chance to reduce his dependence on Ai-Aba. From his refuge in Gurgan he sent his son Jalal al-Din Muhammad to the Ghuzz, w h o had meanwhile taken Nishapur and temporarily expelled Ai-Aba (554/1159).1 H o w e v e r , A i - A b a returned in the same year and firmly resumed p o w e r i n N i s h a p u r , t a k i n g stern measures t o repress the fitna, o r internal strife, which had been raging there.2 It seems that the collapse of Saljuq authority in Khurasan had given free rein to local faction and violence. Agriculture was interrupted by the trampling of opposing armies as w e l l as b y the n o m a d s ' flocks, a n d famine resulted. R e l i g i o u s a n d social sectarianism, the curse o f the K h u r a s a n i a n cities, flared u p o n several occasions: in Astarabad Shah Ghazi Rustam had to mediate between Shi'is and ShafTis, and in Nishapur in 5 56/1161 Ai-Aba jailed the naqib (head) o f the ' A l i d s , h o l d i n g h i m responsible for clashes w h i c h had ruined much of the city and had caused the destruction of such a famous library as that of the 'Uqaili mosque.3 Mahmud K h a n soon tired o f his entente w i t h the G h u z z , a n d in 5 5 6 / 1 1 6 1 decided t o m a k e his peace with Ai-Aba; but the latter seized, blinded, and imprisoned the khan and his son Jalal al-Din Muhammad, and made the khutba in Nishapur for himself alone.4
Ai-Aba was now systematically extending his power. He disputed the possession of Pushang and Herat with the Ghurids; he conquered Qumis and installed as governor of Bis tarn one of his ghulams, although this last was in 5 59/1164 driven out by the Bavandids. In the previous year the sultan in the west, Arslan b. Toghril, had given him presents and an investiture patent, and he accordingly placed Arslan in the khutba of those parts of Khurasan held by him (i.e. Nishapur, Tus, Qumis, and the region between Nasa and Tabas).5 The Amir Ai-Taq had been defeated by a group of Ghuzz under the Yazir chief Yaghmur K h a n , b u t h a d obtained help first f r o m the B a v a n d i d s and then f r o m the K h w a r a z m - S h a h ; he finally planted himself in G u r g a n and D i h i s t a n , and there made the khutba for Il-Arslan.

The latter also sent expeditions against the Ghuzz in Marv and Sarakhs, but his attempt to occupy Nasa was forestalled by the appearance of a Khwarazmian army. Il-Arslan's troops threatened Nishapur for a while, but then turned westwards and drove the shah's erstwhile protege Ai-Taq from Dihistan (560/1165). Ibn Funduq mentions the presence of Khwarazmian troops at Baihaq and Nishapur in 561-2/1166-7, but the time for the shahs' full-scale intervention in Khurasan was not yet come, for they still had many problems to face north of the Oxus.2 Both the Khwarazm-Shahs and the Qarakhanids remained vassals of the Qara-Khitai, though the latter were little disposed to interfere in the internal administration of Khwarazm or of Bukhara and Samarqand, provided that order was kept and the required taxation forwarded t o the G i i r - K h a n ' s ordu (military camp) in Semirechye. Unfortunately for the Qarakhanids, many elements within their territories made for disorder, and the ensuing troubles brought about interference in Transoxiana from both the Khwarazm-Shahs and the Qara-Khitai. The endeavours of the khans to consolidate their authority had often in the past caused clashes with the military classes, whose interests lay in a weak central power. Disputes with the Qarluq tribal divisions culminated in the murder of Tamghach-Khan Ibrahim III of Samarqand in 551/1156. His successor Chaghri Khan, or Kok-Saghir 'Ali Khan, sought revenge by slaying the leader of the Qarluq and driving out others of their chiefs to Khwarazm. According to the account in Ibn al-Athir, Chaghri Khan tried to carry out the orders of his suzerain the Gur-Khan by disarming the Qarluq and planting them in Kashgharia as agriculturists-—and this, not surprisingly, provoked a Qarluq revolt.
Whatever the exact sequence of events, the result was an invasion of Transoxiana by Il-Arslan on behalf of the Qarluq (553/1158). Chaghri Khan appealed to the Qipchaq of the lower Syr Darya and to the QaraKhitai, but the Qara-Khitai army was reluctant to face a battle with the

Ghurid ambitions in Khurasan were combatted and Khwarazmian
arms carried into western Iran against the last Saljuq sultan. A t the
moment of U-Arslan's death Tekish was governor of J and, a strate

Khitai dynasty, never very cohesive, was weakened by the long periods
of regency exercised b y w o m e n , and this m a y well have caused a
relaxation of control o v e r subordinate officials.2 It was of course
convenient for the shahs to raise the banner of jihad against the
infidels, and towards the end of Tekish's reign and in that of his son
'Ala' al-Din M u h a m m a d , this crusading attitude had s o m e value as a
counterbalance to the shahs' unpopularity in orthodox circles, which

described in the sources as being f r o m the Qanghli o r the Baya'ut tribe
of the Yemek, being the daughter of the Qipchaq Khan.2 Tekish ad
mitted large numbers o f the Qipchaq a n dtheir associated peoples into
his armies, a n d it w a s in large measure these barbarians w h o gave the
Khwarazmian troops in Iran a reputation f o r excessive violence and
cruelty. According to Sultan Jalal al-Dln's biographer M u h a m m a d

sought help from the Qara-Khitai, and the latter had crossed into
Tukharistan hoping to recover from the Ghurids of Bamiyan the
town of Balkh, formerly tributary to the Gur-Khan. The Qara-Khitai
were soundly beaten, and they n o w blamed Tekish for involving them

with the Ghurid Sultan Ghiyath al-Din, Tekish turned on the Qara
Khitai. He repelled an invasion of K h w a r a z m and pursued the enemy
to Bukhara, whose population rallied to the Qara-Khitai and held out
against the shah until the city was at last stormed. F r o m the silence
of Juvaini and the other sources, Barthold has doubted the historicity
of this last campaign in Transoxiana.1

especially true of the l a n d o w n i n g classes, anxious to preserve their
social and tenurial privileges under the n e w A r a b regime. Nevertheless,
the period up to the 4th/ioth century was punctuated by several socio
religious protest movements, in some of which elements of the older
faiths of Iran, such as M a z d a k i s m and Zoroastrianism, rose to the
surface; and on one occasion the political and military leader Dailami

Iranian world, were the ethnic, political, and military changes caused
by the incoming movements of Turkish peoples from beyond the Oxus

the n u m b e r of incomers at this time w a s not unduly large; rather, it
continued steadily up to and after the M o n g o l invasions. S o m e tribes
of southern Iran, such as the Baharlu, the Ainallu, and the Qashghai
traditionally date their migration thither to post-Mongol times. In the
Saljuq period there were always many outlets for Turkmen energies in
the frontier warfare with the Byzantines and the Christian powers of the
Caucasus, as well as in the complex warfare between A r a b amirates and
the Crusaders in Syria and Palestine, and many T u r k m e n passed through
Iran to these western battlefields. Others, however, found suitable

regions as Azarbaijan, the Caspian coastlands of M u g h a n , G u r g a n and
Dihistan, and in the oases of Khurasan. Hence there begins the process
of settlement that has made Azarbaijan, parts of Kurdistan, including
the Hamadan region, and a large section of Fars, Turkish-speaking.1

tribal and military aristocracies, and in our period these leaders im
posed their political authority o v e r the Iranian w o r l d at large. This trend
towards Turkish political domination began when the Iranian Sama
nids and the Afrighid and Ma'munid Khwarazm-Shahs were replaced
by the Ghaznavids and Qarakhanids. The Ghaznavids were of servile
origin, but their steppe beginnings were speedily overlaid by the
Iranian culture and the Iranian administrative techniques which they
adopted. T h e Q a r a k h a n i d s initially represented a still l o w e r level o f
assimilation into the Iranian-Islamic culture. In 5th/i i t h - a n d 6th/12th
century Transoxiana the trend towards this assimilation was always
offset b y the fresh arrivals of T u r k i s h peoples f r o m the outer steppes.

practical advantages in the Iranian-Islamic tradition of statecraft and

of state centralization, and of a professional, standing a r m y to buttress
the ruler's p o w e r ; and its concepts of passivity and obedience w i t h w h i c h

militarily less vital. Concentrated as they tended to be in the r e m o t e r

in any case w e r e n e v e r a v e r y articulate g r o u p — c o u l d be heard only
with difficulty in the sophisticated, Iranian atmosphere of the sultans'
court in Isfahan, Hamadan, or Baghdad. It soon became apparent to
the Turkmen that there had g r o w n up a gulf between themselves and
the sultans, and that the latter were quite prepared to use A r a b or
Kurdish or any other troops against their fellow Turks. Hence they
tended to rally round those members of the Saljuq family w h o were
discontented or w h o had been passed over for the succession despite
their valid claims of seniority within the family; such aspirants as
Ibrahim Inal, Qutlumush b. Arslan Isra'il, and Q a v u r t w e r e accord
ingly able to use T u r k m e n resentment against the sultans to support
their o w n pretensions. A clear-sighted statesman like Nizam al-Mulk
recognized the Turkmen's legitimate claims to gratitude and advocated
attention to their needs; but after his death such counsels w e r e heard
less often. It was the blundering and officious handling of the T u r k m e n
b y Sanjar's officials and c o m m a n d e r s that led to the outburst o f G h u z z
violence in K h u r a s a n at the end of his reign, resulting in the capture
and detention of the sultan himself, the nomads' overrunning the
main towns of Khurasan, the end of direct Saljuq p o w e r in north
eastern Iran, and the eventual destruction of the Saljuq principality of
K i r m a n (see a b o v e , p p . 15 2 ff.).

uniform Turkish domination of the Iranian world was temporarily
halted in the east b y the G h u r i d dynasty in Afghanistan, w h o s e rulers,
originally mountain chieftains in G h u r , had become sovereigns of an
empire that stretched from Bistam in the west to the Ganges valley
in the east. This achievement w a s only transient, for it w a s destroyed b y

w e s t e r n Iran against the ' A b b a s i d caliph (a campaign that b r o u g h t h i m
much obloquy in orthodox Sunni circles), and he himself went d o w n
before the rising p o w e r of the Mongols. In Afghanistan today the
Ghurids have been assigned an important place in the country's

Afghanistan the centre of an empire—and attempts have been made to
s h o w that the Ghurids w e r e Pashto-speaking, and that the earliest
Pashto literature sprang from their court circle.1
Already by the latter part of Toghril's reign the Saljuq sultan de
pended to a considerable extent on a professional, standing army, which
comprised a nucleus of slave commanders and their retainers (ghulams)
drawn from a multiplicity of nationalities: Turks, Armenians, Greeks,
Kurds, Caucasians, and even negroes. This nucleus was supplemented
by contingents from tributary Arab, Kurdish, and Persian rulers in
Iraq, Kurdistan, the Caspian provinces, Sistan, and so on. The Turk
men tribesmen continued to be of military significance in the 5 t h / n t h
century, but the sultans gradually adopted a policy of diverting the
Turkmen begs and their followers to the frontiers of the empire, to
Anatolia, the Caucasus, Syria, etc., where there were plentiful oppor
tunities for jihad against the Christians or against heterodox Muslim
groups such as the Syrian Isma'Ilis and the Fatimids.
Maintaining a standing army was expensive; and since an increase
w a s required in the state's revenue, the degree of centralization and
administrative complexity inevitably g r e w also. Nizam al-Mulk built
up a nexus of relatives and clients within the central government and in
the key posts of the provincial administrations, and in this w a y sur
veillance over the empire was far-reaching in Malik-Shah's reign. The
basic solution for paying the a r m y was an extended and regularized
system of iqta's, land grants, whose revenues were used to support the
soldiers. Here the Saljuqs w e r e n o t innovators, for the system had its
roots in the A r a b caliphate, and had been widely used in the 4th/ioth
century b y such dynasties as the Buyids and Hamdanids; but w i t h the
political decline of the Buyids and their inability to control their troops,

The earliest authenticated written Pashto literature comes, in fact, from the early 17th century.

their iqta' system in western Iran became disordered and riddled with
abuses. In the 5th/nth century the Saljuq central government regu

ultimate rights over the land. Nevertheless, the p o w e r of the muqta's

iqta's (and therefore revocable, at least in theory) must at this time

W h a t w a s in effect a large-scale application of the iqtac system w a s the
Saljuq sultans' practice of granting provinces o r regions as appanages
for other members of the family. This arose originally from Turkish
tribal practice, w h e r e a tribal chief's patrimony was often divided amongst
his male relatives while the most senior relative remained overlord.
G i v e n the size of the Saljuq empire in the second half o f the 5 t h / n t h
century, such a measure of administrative devolution was sensible
e n o u g h ; it w a s only in the next century, w h e n the empire w a s losing its
cohesion, that the Saljuq maliks in the provinces successfully used their
appanages to defy the central p o w e r and further their o w n ambitions.1
The degree of unity achieved in the Saljuq empire under Alp-Arslan
and Malik-Shah could not be maintained b y their successors. Y e t the

M u h a m m a d ' s death in 511/1118 he exercised ultimate sovereignty
over his relatives the Saljuq sultans in western Iran and Iraq. S o m e

this century, especially after the death of M u h a m m a d b. Malik-Shah.
Beginning as genuine tutors attached to the households of y o u n g
Saljuq princes, Turkish slave commanders often secured an ascendancy
o v e r their charges and then set t h e m aside, ruling themselves as
provincial g o v e r n o r s o r in the end as independent potentates. B y
the second half of the century, Turkish provincial governors were
founding dynasties and calling themselves atabegs even w h e n they had
n e v e r h a d a Saljuq prince in their charge (e.g. the Salghurids of Fars:
see a b o v e , p . 172).
In the succession disputes which n o w racked the Saljuq empire in
the west, the atabegs espoused various Saljuq candidates and gave
them military support, hoping thereby to place a weak and pliant ruler
on the throne. F o r their part, the sultans could not easily control these
centrifugal tendencies. T h e rise o f such atabeg dynasties as the Z a n g i d s
in Mosul, the Eldigiizids and Ahmadilis in Azarbaijan and Arran,
the Salghurids in Fars, and so on, meant that the territory in the west
directly administered b y the sultans w a s shrinking. Y e t they still h a d
to maintain armies against rivals to the succession, against overbearing
atabegs, and against the increasingly activist policy of the 'Abbasid
caliphs. The territory which they controlled was inadequate for grant
ing iqta's to their troops, and the troubled social and political conditions
of the period cannot have favoured the regular collection of taxation
f r o m the population: T h e sultans w e r e forced willy-nilly into alliances
and coalitions with the atabegs and other Turkish military com
manders in order to d r a w u p o n their troops. T h u s the sultans had little
space in which to manoeuvre, and by the time of Arslan b. Toghril, the
creature of the Eldigiizids, it had shrunk to n a r r o w proportions.
Second, the century sees a rise in the material p o w e r and prestige of
the 'Abbasid caliph of Baghdad. The end of the "Dailami interlude"
in Iranian history meant the failure of the S h f i bid for supreme auth
ority in Iran. The Fatimids were repulsed from Iraq and northern Syria
b y the i n c o m i n g Saljuqs, a n d after the death in 487/1094 o f al-Mustansir,
they were no longer a vigorous and expansionist power. Although
Isma'Ilism increased in strength after the Nizari split f r o m the main
Fatimid line of al-Musta'li, it w a s notable m o r e f o r its terrorism than
for its political and territorial achievements; only in Kuhistan, parts of
Dailam, and in parts of Fars did the Isma'ilis control substantial
stretches of territory.

political p o w e r than had the Buyids. However, they had to defer to the
caliphs, w h o were the moral and spiritual leaders of the Sunni world,
for it w a s b y n o means obvious even in Malik-Shah's time that the
Fatimids' ability to h a r m the Saljuqs had passed its peak. O n l y at the
very close of his reign, w h e n the steadying influence of N i z a m al-Mulk
had just been removed, did Malik-Shah seem to harbour thoughts of
d i s p l a c i n g t h e ' A b b a s i d s f r o m B a g h d a d (see p . 101 a b o v e ) ; b u t t h e
sultan's o w n death ended this project. After the nonentities and
weaklings of the early Buyid period, the 'Abbasid family was n o w
yielding s o m e capable a n d effective caliphs: e.g. al-Mustazhir, al

shahs became virtually independent after Sanjar's death, subject only
to the suzerainty of the Qara-Khitai. Their imperialist ambitions,
blocked in the east b y the Qara-Khitai, accordingly turned southwards
and westwards into Iran. A struggle with the Ghurids for p o w e r in
Khurasan long prevented the shahs from taking advantage of the
fragmented condition of western and central Iran, and it was only in the

last years o f the 6th/i2th century that Tekish vanquished the last
Saljuq Sultan Toghri'l b. Arslan and m o v e d K h w â r a z m i a n troops to

Ghurids and Qara-Khitai against him and organizing in Iran coalitions
of atabegs and local governors threatened by the K h w â r a z m i a n advance.
(It does n o t seem, h o w e v e r , that the caliph encouraged the M o n g o l s t o
attack the K h w â r a z m i a n s f r o m the rear.)1 Also, the caliph threw his
moral and spiritual weight against the shahs for their impiety in
threatening the caliphate and their p r o - S h f i activities. Certainly the
Khwârazmians made themselves intensely unpopular in Iran, but
whether the caliph's could have stayed the K h w â r a z m i a n march on
Iraq is an u n s o l v e d question o f history. T h e distant pressure o f the

CHAPTER 2
THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF
THE SALJUQ EMPIRE
T h e period o f the G r e a t Saljuqs can largely b e regarded as representing
o r corresponding to the early M i d d l e A g e s . T o m a k e this division is
not to underestimate the fundamental fact of the unbroken thread of
Persian history in Islamic times. Stretching back behind the Saljuq
p e r i o d is a l o n g continuity o f administrative practice, b u t u n d e r the
Saljuqs the old institutions gained a new meaning; developments that
had begun in the preceding period crystallized, and n e w elements of
worth were added to the Persian heritage. The Saljuqs did not formu
late the details of the n e w system: this was mainly the w o r k of the
officials o f the bureaucracy a n d o f the religious institution, w h o w e r e
for the most part Persians and not Turks. But the Saljuqs were in some
measure responsible for the spirit in which the n e w system worked.
M a n y Saljuq institutions lasted in their outward forms (though the
terminology was in some cases changed) until the twentieth century;
and without a knowledge of these, and an attempt to trace them back
to earlier times, w e cannot fully comprehend the questions that began
to agitate Iran in the nineteenth century and the solutions sought to
them. Politically and religiously Iran has travelled far from the theory
of a theocracy in which the caliph exercised constituent authority and
legitimized the sultan's assumption of p o w e r ; and economically f r o m
t h e iqtd* i n i t s v a r i o u s f o r m s a n d t h e g u i l d s a n d c o r p o r a t i o n s o f S a l j u q
society. But it was not until the twentieth century that the Constitu
tional Revolution separated modern Iran f r o m medieval Persia.
In m a n y w a y s the Saljuq period did not differ f r o m the preceding o r
succeeding periods. It was a time of chronic wars; and hardship, famine,
pestilence, violence, ignorance, and superstition w e r e all c o m m o n . But,
on the other hand, it was a time during which Iranian civilization
reached heights of religious and secular achievements that have not been
easily surpassed. M e n such as Ghazali, Shahristani, Nasafi, N i z a m al
Mulk, 'Umar K h a y y a m , A b u Sa'id b. Abi'l Khair, Anvari, and
Mu'izzi all lived in these years. Important technical innovations w e r e
made in pottery and metal-work. A high degree of technical skill was

achieved b y w e a v e r s ; and n e w elements of scale and spatial composition
w e r e introduced into architecture. T h e Saljuq state w a s the organizing
f o r c e t h a t b r o u g h t a b o u t c o n d i t i o n s i n w h i c h t h e a r t s flourished, a n d
the talents of these men and m a n y others burgeoned and thrived. It
must not be supposed, however, that uniformity was established
throughout the empire at any one time o r throughout the period in
any one place. There was a great diversity of climatic and physical
conditions within the empire; and in spite of the unifying factor of
Islam and the general levelling tendency of Turkish military govern
ment, there w a s m u c h local particularism and variety in the social
ethics of different groups and communities. There was, for example, a
standing opposition between the settled and the semi-settled popu
lation; between Turk and non-Turk; and between the military and the
rest of the population. There was also a dichotomy between the men of
the cities, w i t h their highly developed crafts and industries and tradi
tions of civilization, and the population living on the land, whose main
function w a s to p r o v i s i o n the cities and a b o v e all to p r o v i d e f o r the
needs of the army.
T h e sources, unfortunately, d o n o t tell us m u c h about the daily life
of the people, o r h o w this was affected b y the influx of large numbers of
T u r k m e n n o m a d s . P r e s u m a b l y t h e p r o d u c e f r o m t h e n o m a d s ' flocks
made an important contribution to the supplies of the towns; and there
was a constant infiltration of nomads into the towns and villages. The
sources are also silent o n the details o f the sultan's administration. It is
also difficult to interpret such information as they give, o w i n g to a
frequent lack o f precision in the use o f technical terms. N o r is it
possible to obtain a clear picture of the characters of the sultans and
their officials. T h e achievements o f the period h a v e been attributed b y

examination o f the sources w o u l d suggest that this v i e w is t o o general.
There can be little doubt of the competence of Toghril Beg and A l p

M u h a m m a d b. Malik-Shah seems also to have had a more than ordinary
degree of competence. The sources attribute justice and g o o d govern
ment to Malik-Shah and San jar, as they do to N i z a m al-Mulk; while
m a n y of the later sultans are charged with dissipation and negligence in
state affairs. In general the sultans w e r e m e n of action and m e n o f

expeditions of one sort or another. Their main recreation was probably
the chase; the breeding of horses and falcons was widely maintained.
Their personal attainments in the arts may not have been high, but
under their rule and patronage great development took place. The
relatively stable and effective administration established under their
leadership enabled the various classes to carry o n their lives and
occupations in comparative security. M e n of learning and of religion,
including the Sufis, were held in high respect; and the local people were
left t o practice their local customs. This is n o t t o say that injustice a n d
oppression did not occur, but on the w h o l e it did not reach lengths
which the population felt to be intolerable. There was unusually little
internal rebellion (as distinct f r o m struggles f o r p o w e r a m o n g rival
amirs), though the spread of the Isma'ili m o v e m e n t suggests that a
strong undercurrent of social discontent existed.

this v i e w w h e n he states, " Those possessed of learning have said,
' W h e n a king is a d o r n e d b y religion a n d his rule is stable because o f
justice, kingship will not disappear f r o m his house unless, G o d forbid,
some disorder appears in religion or he commits tyranny'."1 There was
no separation between church and state; men were not conscious of

w e r e t w o sides of one coin. Non-conformity and political opposition
were thus inseparable. Patriotism was an u n k n o w n virtue. All the sultan
expected of his subjects was that they should pay their taxes and pray
for his welfare, while they expected f r o m him security and justice. T h e
state did not demand, o r receive, the loyalty of the c o m m o n man.
Loyalty, so far as it transcended the b o u n d s of the tribe, guild, quarter,
o r c i t y , w a s a c c o r d e d n o t t o t h e s t a t e b u t t o I s l a m o r t h e sharfa. S o l o n g
as the sultan represented the sharfa he commanded, in some measure,
the loyalty o f the people, b u t as s o o n as he ceased to represent the

caliphate n o longer corresponded—if it ever h a d — w i t h practice. T h e
caliphate had b e c o m e merely a symbolic office maintaining links w i t h
the past; and the conception of the sultanate as a simple delegation of
authority b y the caliph to the temporal ruler could hardly be main
tained in the political circumstances which prevailed. F o r some
governors had seized their provinces b y force, while others, though
they were not rebels, were not subject to the appointment of the
caliph: an irregular situation, which threatened the life of the com
munity. T h e latter was supposed to exist in order to carry out the
precepts of the shari'a; and unless the s h a r f a w a s its basis, there w a s n o
reason f o r its existence. It w a s thus imperative that the situation should

domination, m a d e an attempt to legalize w h a t w a s in effect a usurpa
tion of power. He asserted that even if the caliph was placed under
r e s t r a i n t (" c o n t r o l o v e r h i m h a v i n g b e e n seized b y o n e o f his a u x i l i a r i e s ,

h o l d the office o f caliph, and such an anomalous situation could stand
provided the usurper conformed to the ordinances of the faith and the
requirements of justice.1 Having in mind perhaps such independent
rulers as M a h m u d of Ghazna, M a w a r d i also put f o r w a r d the v i e w that
" certain concessions might be made to the governors of outlying
regions, w i t h o u t prejudice to the rights of the caliph as effective ruler
o f t h e c e n t r a l p r o v i n c e s " , p r o v i d e d , first, t h a t t h e g o v e r n o r a g r e e d t o
preserve the dignity of the caliphate and s h o w such respect for it as w o u l d
preclude any idea of insubordination; and secondly, that he undertook to
g o v e r n according to the shari'a. T h e caliph for his part should validate all
religious appointments and decisions hitherto made by the governor, and
the t w o parties w o u l d make a pact of friendship and mutual assistance.2
By thus keeping those w h o had usurped power within the framework
of the c o m m u n i t y M a w a r d i enabled it to survive and prepared the w a y
for the n e w relationship between the caliphate and sultanate which was
to be w o r k e d out under the Saljuqs. The early Saljuq sultans insisted
on receiving diplomas f r o m the caliphs, partly to place themselves on a
level with the Ghaznavids and to legalize their rule, and partly to
acquire prestige by adopting the role of the defenders of orthodox
Islam. The sultans after Malik-Shah also endeavoured to obtain the

caliph's recognition, largely in order t o strengthen themselves against
rivals. T h e early period saw n o t merely the reimposition o f Sunnism
after a time o f Shi'I supremacy, b u t a reaffirmation o f the caliph's
position ashead o f the Islamic community, together with the incorpora
tion o f the sultanate as a necessary element into the ideal o f Islamic
government. F r o m this stemmed a n e w system o f administration com
posed o f a series o f interconnected jurisdictions w h o s e stability de
pended, n o t o n a separation o f the civil arm from the military, b u t o n
orthodoxy o r "right religion" a n d the personal loyalty o f sultan to

lated this n e w relationship between the caliphate a n dthe sultanate w a s
Ghazali (d. 505/1111). H e envisaged a n e w association between the
caliph a n dthe sultan a n dassumed co-operation between them. O nthe
one hand the caliph w a st o b e designated b y the sultan, w h o , through
his exercise o f constituent authority, recognized the institutional
authority o f the caliph; and o n the other hand the validity o f the sultan's
government was established b y his oath o f allegiance to that caliph w h o
authorized his rule. In this w a ythe sultan recognized that the shari'a
was the organizing principle o f the Sunni community, while the caliph
acknowledged that thesultanate, b y establishing order and maintaining
discipline, provided conditions in which Islamic institutions could con
tinue a n dt h e M u s l i m fulfil his true destiny.1
Because the p o w e r o f the Saljuqs rested upon the shari'a, it differed
from thepower of the Buyids, which hadbeen usurped.2 This w a s of
more than theoretical importance. T h e Saljuqs made possible the pre
servation o f t h e religious life o f t h e community, a n d religion f o r t h e
M u s l i m embraced virtually all aspects o f t h e life o f t h e community.
This is n o t t o say that Ghazali regarded t h e Saljuqs' government as a
truly Islamic government. His w o r k s contain several allusions to the
injustice o f the Turks. In an undated letter to Abu'l Fath 'AH b.

Binder, " Al-Ghazali's Theory of Islamic Government", in The Muslim World(1955), pp. 229-41. 2 The new relationship between the caliph and the sultan is reflected in the laqabs given to the Saljuq sultans, which contained the word din (religion) in contradistinction to those of the Buyids, which contained the word daula (state). Toghril Beg was given the laqab Rukn al-Din and Jalal al-Daula. Alp-Arslan was an exception to the general rule: his laqab was 'Adud al-Daula. 3 Fadd'il al-anam, ed.

however, Ghazali was not concerned with the relationship between the
caliphate and the sultanate. W h a t he had in mind here was not the
preservation of the religious life of the community, which he had
discussed elsewhere, but the maintenance of the p o w e r of the sultanate,
which, if that life was to be preserved, w a s necessary for the establish
ment of order. N o r was he concerned to argue the shar'i basis of the
sultanate (this he had already established elsewhere), but rather to ensure
that the p o w e r of the sultanate should be used with justice. " K n o w " ,
he writes, " that G o d has singled out t w o groups of men and given
t h e m p r e f e r e n c e o v e r o t h e r s : first p r o p h e t s , u p o n t h e m b e p e a c e , a n d
secondly kings. Prophets He sent to His servants to lead them to Him
and kings to restrain them from [aggression against] each other; and
in His wisdom He handed over to them (kings) the well-being of the
lives of His servants and He gave them (kings) a high status."2
Obedience to and love for kings was therefore incumbent upon men,
and, conversely, opposition and enmity towards them were unseemly;
but only he w h o acted with justice was the true sultan.3

achieved b y the maintenance of each m a n in his rightful place, which,
in turn, w o u l d assure stability.
Nizam al-Mulk's view of religion was largely utilitarian. His ap
parent h o r r o r of and opposition to Shi'ism in all forms w a s based o n
political rather than religious grounds. He saw a close connexion
between stability and right religion.
W h a t a king needs m o s t is right religion, because kingship and religion are t w o brothers [he writes]. W h e n e v e r any disturbance appears in the kingdom, disorder also occurs in religion; and people of bad religion and malefactors appear. W h e n e v e r there is disorder in the affairs of religion the k i n g d o m is disturbed, and the power of malefactors increases; and they cause the kings to lose their dignity and make them troubled at heart; innovations appear and rebels become powerful.1
Justice, however, rather than right religion was the ultimate basis of
Nizam al-Mulk's theory. " K i n g s h i p " , he states, "remains w i t h the
unbeliever but not with injustice."2 But there were no sanctions except
moral sanctions, and Nizam al-Mulk clearly believed that rights were
acquired and maintained by force. The power of the ruler was absolute,
it required no authorization, and the administration was centralized in
his person. Against his arbitrary p o w e r the population had no rights
and n o freedom. It was this theory of kingship which was ultimately to
prevail in Persia. Under the Saljuqs, however, the rule of the sultans
still h a d a shar'i basis. This did n o t stop the arbitrary use o f p o w e r
b y the g o v e r n m e n t and its officials, b u t o n the w h o l e it prevented it
from reaching lengths which were intolerable to the people.
During the Saljuq period the ruling and orthodox institutions were
drawn m o r e closely together, although the functional division between
t h e m w a s m o r e sharply defined than heretofore.3 A l l affairs, religious
and temporal, became the concern of the sultan. This was inevitable
w h e n "right religion" was regarded as the basis of the stability of the
state. T h e caliph remained the supreme authority in matters relating to
the legal administration; but once he had authorized the sultan's
assumption of power, his main function concerned the performance of
prayers and religious leadership. W h e n Toghril Beg brought the caliph

'Amid al-Mulk Kunduri took charge of the administration of Baghdad,
and as compensation f o r this he g a v e an allowance to the caliph. F r o m
this time onwards the caliph was no longer liable to arbitrary deposi
tion, as he had been in B u y i d times. H e w a s allowed to enjoy his
allowance and the income of his personal estates w i t h o u t fear of any
demand being made on him o r of his estates being confiscated. The
dignity and g o o d n a m e of his office w e r e in s o m e measure restored.
But the respect the Saljuqs showed him, although considerable, was
limited; and whereas his residence in Buyid times had been the
refuge f o r all w h o feared the Buyids, a like situation w a s n o t tolerated
by the Saljuqs. Further, they sought to control the caliph through
marriage alliances and occasionally through appointments to his
vizierate.

daughter, w a s betrothed to the Caliph al-Qa'im. Bundari states that
al-Qa'im intended b y this marriage to strengthen the sultan's prestige
a n d c e m e n t his friendship w i t h h i m . 1 I n 453/1061 T o g h r i l B e g sent
the qadi of Ray to Baghdad to ask for the hand of the caliph's daughter
in marriage. Ibn al-Jauzi states that Toghril Beg's f o r m e r wife, w h o
h a d died in 452/1060-1, h a d r e c o m m e n d e d h i m to take this step.2 T h e
demand caused the caliph great vexation: even the Buyids had never
forced h i m to such an action. H e tried to get it w i t h d r a w n and com
m a n d e d h i s e n v o y t o d e m a n d 300,000 d i n a r s f r o m T o g h r i l B e g i f h e
insisted on the marriage. K u n d u r i told the caliph's e n v o y bluntly that
a refusal w a s out of the question. Eventually, after a series of threats and
counter-threats, the marriage contract was ratified outside Tabriz in
S h a ' b a n 454/1062. I n t h e f o l l o w i n g y e a r T o g h r i l B e g c a m e t o B a g h d a d
and demanded the caliph's daughter. It was pointed out to him that the
object of the marriage had been h o n o u r and not union, and that if the
caliph's daughter was to be seen b y him it should be in Baghdad.
Eventually she was taken to the sultan's residence in the city and he
paid her elaborate homage. W h e n T o g h r i l Beg left Baghdad in the
following year, the caliph unwillingly gave permission for his daughter
to accompany him.
In 464/1071-2 al-Qa'im asked the h a n d of Alp-Arslan's daughter o n

daughter b y his favourite wife Terken K h a t u n . This alliance caused the
relations between the caliph and the sultan to become strained, because
after b e i n g t a k e n t o t h e caliph's r e s i d e n c e in 480/1087, M a l i k - S h a h ' s
daughter complained of the caliph's neglect of her, and returned to her
f a t h e r in 482/1089. A s a result o f his d a u g h t e r ' s u n h a p p y m a r r i a g e t o
the caliph, Malik-Shah appears to have conceived a hatred of him. In
484/1091, w h e n h e c a m e t o B a g h d a d , h e i g n o r e d the caliph's presence
and insisted that the caliph should r e v o k e the nomination of his eldest
son ( w h o subsequently became caliph as al-Mustazhir) in f a v o u r of
Abu'l Fadl Ja'far, the caliph's son b y Malik-Shah's daughter and retire
to Basra (or, according to some accounts, to Damascus or the Hijaz).
The caliph was loth to agree and asked for a delay to make plans for
his d e p a r t u r e . M e a n w h i l e M a l i k - S h a h left B a g h d a d in R a b f I 485/1092
for Isfahan, taking Abu'l Fadl Ja'far with him. Shortly afterwards
Malik-Shah was assassinated and al-Muqtadi was relieved of the demand.
There are several subsequent instances of marriages between the houses
of the sultan and the caliph.
In Baghdad, from the time when Toghril Beg took over the ad
ministration until the caliphate of al-Mustarshid (512-29/1118-35),
administrative authority in Iraq w a s u n d e r the sultan and his officials.

caliph, and his duty was to watch o v e r the p o w e r of the caliph and his
officials; he w a s normally a T u r k i s h amir and had certain military
functions also. In the city of Baghdad there was to some extent a
conflict of jurisdiction. T h e population tended to refer to the caliph,
w h o was always accessible to them, even though he could do little but
refer back to the sultan or his representatives. Responsibility for local
order and security seems to have been shared somewhat between the
shahna a n d the caliph's officials. T h e caliph's vizier also exercised s o m e
kind of judicial authority in Baghdad, and f r o m time to time he held a
ma^alim c o u r t . C e r t a i n t a x e s , i n c l u d i n g jizya, w e r e l e v i e d b y t h e c a l i p h ' s
officials. T h e r e are also instances of the caliph's m a k i n g levies o n the
population for the repair of the city walls.
During the reign of Malik-Shah various attempts were made by
Nizam al-Mulk to establish his nominee in the caliph's vizierate. This
strained the relationship between Nizam al-Mulk and the Caliph al
Muqtadi, but the vizier's hostility to the caliph was subsequently trans
formed by al-Muqtadi's gracious reception of him on the occasion of

teaching and the traditions and ideals inherited f r o m the old Persian
theory of state. E v e n N i z a m al-Mulk for all his o r t h o d o x y failed to
create an acceptable synthesis of the two. W i t h the g r o w t h of the mad
rasas the secretarial class and the literary m e n o n the one hand, and the
'ulamä on the other, moved closer together because they shared a
c o m m o n training in the madrasas, w h i c h became in effect Sunni
strongholds. The former became more fully Islamicized, and the latter
perhaps more Persianized. The dichotomy between the t w o traditions,
the old Persian and the Islamic, remained, but under the Saljuqs more
integration was achieved than ever before.1
T h e madrasas w e r e not, as is sometimes alleged, f o u n d e d b y N i z ä m
al-Mulk, nor were they the only centres of higher learning in the Saljuq
period.2 But he was responsible for the new era of brilliance which
began under the Saljuqs and w h i c h caused his schools to eclipse all
other contemporary institutions of learning. He was also responsible
for turning them into seminaries of Sunni orthodoxy, in the same w a y

Shi'i propaganda. Already in the fourth/tenth century there had been
madrasas in Nishâpùr, which, in size of population and development of
culture and industry, was able to compete with the Fätimid capital and
with Baghdad. The madrasas in Khurasan were possibly influenced by
the convents or hospices belonging to the K a r r ä m i y y a — a nIslamic sect

Da'ud founded a madrasa in M a r v ; Alp-Arslan in Baghdad, M u h a m m a d

The most famous madrasas, however, were those founded by Nizam

the amirs also built madrasas. Thus Khumar-Tegin, w h o was in the
service of Tutush b. Alp-Arslan, built a madrasa in Baghdad and called
it after his master. M u h a m m a d b. Yaghi'-Siyan (d. 5 01/1107-8) built a
number of madrasas in his iqta' in Azarbaijan. Several existed in Fars,

became associated with them. Their leadership, once established, was
maintained by military might coupled with conciliation and consulta

over the Ghuzz. The outlying groups, although nominally acknow
ledging the overlordship of the sultan, acted independently or semi
independently. Politically the Saljuq empire was a loose confederation
of semi-independent kingdoms over which the sultan exercised nominal
a u t h o r i t y . S a l j u q p r i n c e s w e r e k n o w n a s maliks i n c o n t r a d i s t i n c t i o n t o
the paramount ruler, the sultan.1 Only for a brief period towards the
end of Malik-Shah's reign was any degree of unity achieved.
Originally the Saljuqs seem to have held that their leadership was
vested in the family as a w h o l e ; and that the various sections of their
loose confederation were each led by a member of the family. They were
thus in the beginning the leaders of their people but not territorial
sovereigns, and they probably thought that their rule extended wher
ever their people r o a m e d in search of pasture, and not, in any case at
first, t h a t i t w a s t i e d t o a g i v e n a r e a . D u r i n g t h e e a r l y p e r i o d o f e x p a n
sion the khutba w a s read in s o m e cities in K h u r a s a n in the n a m e of
Toghril Beg, and in others in the name of Chaghri Beg Da'ud, although
Chaghri Beg never disputed the primacy of his brother.
This conception of the Saljuq family as the guardian of a tribal
confederation had already been considerably modified before the death
o f T o g h r i l B e g in 455/1063, and u n d e r A l p - A r s l a n the Persian ideal
of an autocratic sovereign was to some extent adopted. It was almost
inevitable that once the Saljuqs were no longer merely the leaders of a
tribal migration but were the rulers of a territorial empire, they w o u l d be
forced to seek some m o r e stable basis of p o w e r than the Ghuzz, or the
" T u r k m e n " , as the Islamicized G h u z z within the Saljuq empire w e r e
called. This change of basis began to take place under Alp-Arslan,
p e r h a p s e v e n u n d e r T o g h r i l B e g , a n d i t w a s finally c o m p l e t e d u n d e r
Malik-Shah. F r o m then the ultimate guarantee of the sultan's rule was
the standing army composed of slaves and freedmen. This change was
gradual: any sudden rupture with the past w o u l d have alienated the
Turkmen tribes, w h o continued to be an important element in the

w e r e enrolled in the sultan's service in this way.
A s the sultan's basis of p o w e r changed, so the custom of the steppe
and of government b y consultation and conciliation were replaced by
the absolutism and arbitrary power of the old Persian ruling tradition,
and also b y a distrust of all to w h o m p o w e r w a s delegated. In spite
of this, the original conceptions—of the leadership of the group being
inherent in the Saljuq family, and of the empire as a loose confederation
whose different parts were led b y members of the family—never entirely
disappeared; and they are discernible in the atabegate as well as the
i q t a c ( s e e p . 231 b e l o w ) . 1
It w a s perhaps natural that the conception of the sultan as arbitrary
r u l e r s h o u l d first b e c h a l l e n g e d b y m e m b e r s o f t h e S a l j u q f a m i l y i t s e l f ;
and the fact that there was no stable system of succession encouraged
them to dispute when a weak prince or a child succeeded to the throne.
T h e normal practice was for the sultan to nominate his vail cahd. N o
regulations governing his choice w e r e laid d o w n , and sometimes the
wives of the sultan exerted influence in the matter. If a prince's mother
was free-born and a Saljuq, for example, this was probably favourable
for his chance of succession. Berk-Yaruq's mother was free-born and a
Saljuq, and this was allegedly one of the reasons that led to his becoming
sultan.
T h e fact that the sultan proclaimed one of his sons as his vail 'ahd
did not always ensure his succession, however. Toghril Beg, w h o had
n o children himself, married one of Chaghri Beg Da'ud's wives after
Chaghri Beg's death, and proclaimed her son Sulaiman as his vali
'ahd. O n the death of Toghril Beg, his vizier, "Amid al-Mulk K u n d u r i
put Sulaiman on the throne; but seeing that the amirs opposed that
accession he proclaimed Alp-Arslan, an older son of Chaghri Beg by
another wife, as sultan in Qazvin, and he had the khutba read in R a y
in the names of both. Y a b g h u b. Mlka'il, governor of Herat, and
Q u t l u m u s h each rebelled in 456/1063-4. A l p - A r s l a n defeated t h e m and
was later reconciled to both. Qara-Arslan in K i r m a n also rebelled some
three years later (459/1066-7). H e t o o w a s reinstated after b e i n g
defeated. It may well be that the opposition which Alp-Arslan en
countered from Y a b g h u and Qutlumish marked a turning-point in the
relations between the sultan and his family. A s the conception of
autocratic ruler replaced that of ruling khan, the moral basis of Saljuq

authority was weakened. Alp-Arslan may well have realized that some
substitute had to be found for the former tribal loyalties to which the
Saljuqs o w e d their position, and that if he was to keep even a limited
control over the members of the family, then a standing army loyal to
himself was necessary.
In 458/1065-7 A l p - A r s l a n determined to appoint M a l i k - S h a h as his
vali 'ahd, and he had his name included in the khutba after his own.
This was probably normal practice. A t the same time as this nomination,
Alp-Arslan divided part of the kingdom among his relatives in order to
a b a t e a n y q u a r r e l w i t h t h e s u c c e s s i o n o f M a l i k - S h a h ( s e e p . 23 5 b e l o w ) .
In spite of this, various members of the family disputed his accession
on the death of Alp-Arslan. Qavurd, the ruler of Kirman, wrote to
M a l i k - S h a h s t a t i n g t h a t i t w a s m o r e fitting f o r h i m t o s u c c e e d , o n t h e
grounds that he was Alp-Arslan's eldest brother while Malik-Shah was
only a young son.1 Malik-Shah, w h o was then aged about eighteen,
replied that a brother did not inherit if there was a son. This, however,
was Islamic and not tribal law. Q a v u r d made a determined eifort to
seize the throne, b u t he w a s defeated and killed. Tekish, to w h o m Balkh
a n d T u k h a r i s t a n h a d been assigned, rebelled twice, in 473/1080-1 a n d
477/1084-5; o n the second occasion he w a s captured and blinded.

nominal authority seems to have been recognized, though he twice had
to intervene in person.2 Tutush came himself to pay his respects to

Malik-Shah nominated A h m a d , the eldest son of Zubaida K h a t u n ,
as his vali 'ahd, b u t h e died in 481/1088-9. A n e w heir w a s n o t n o m i

Terken K h a t u n , his last wife, a Qarakhanid princess, succeeded in

of her son M a h m u d , in return for which she handed over Abu'l Fadl

Malik-Shah since his mother had returned f r o m the caliph's court.

a slight supremacy in 497/1103-4 at the cost of m u c h disorder through

virtually that o f ah independent ruler. O n his d e a t h b e d in 498/1105,
B e r k - Y a r u q nominated his son M a l i k - S h a h as his vali cahd, b u t
although the khutba was read in his name in Baghdad, M u h a m m a d
soon succeeded in establishing himself as sultan. D u r i n g the reign of

O n the death of Muhammad, Sanjar defeated M a h m u d b. M u h a m m a d ,
w h o m M u h a m m a d had nominated as his vali cahd at Saveh ^1513/1119,
and he then made himself sultan. He did not, however, m o v e to a m o r e

held in western and southern Persia and Iraq, while he himself returned
to Khurasan. M a h m u d and his successors are referred to in the sources
as sultans, b u t although they enjoyed a certain measure of independence,
their status, until the death o f Sanjar, w a s o n l y that o f maliks. It is n o t
clear w h y Sanjar remained in K h u r a s a n : he m a y not have had any
personal following outside that province, o r he m a y have considered it
unwise to absent himself permanently f r o m the eastern frontiers since

amirs and atabegs or, ultimately, to prevent the disintegration of the
empire.
Geographically the Saljuq empire was divided into provinces which
corresponded broadly with the provinces that had formed the Sassanian
empire. A n elaborate system of roads, which also went back to the
pre-Islamic period, radiated from Baghdad to serve not only the
movement of armies but also that of merchants. The most famous of
these w a s the great K h u r a s a n t r u n k road going east f r o m Baghdad via
Kirmanshah, Hamadan, Ray, Nishapur, and M a r v to the frontier towns
o n the Jaxartes. Cross-roads branched off f r o m K i r m a n s h a h to Tabriz
and Ardabil; from Hamadan to Isfahan; from Ray to Zanjan and
Tabriz; and from Nishapur roads went to Tabas, Qa'in, Herat, and
Sistan. A n o t h e r route led south-east f r o m Baghdad to Basra, f r o m
whence there lay a road to A h v a z and Shiraz, where roads from Isfahan
and Ray, f r o m Y a z d and Nishapur, and f r o m Sirjan, K i r m a n , and
Sistan all converged.1 T h e administrative divisions of the empire did
not correspond precisely with the provincial divisions, although when
the empire began to fragment it tended to break u p into geopolitical
units centred on the major provinces of Khurasan, Azarbaijan, Iraq,
K i r m a n , and Fars. Administratively the empire fell into t w o b r o a d
divisions: an area directly administered b y the sultan's divan, and an
indirectly administered area. In general, the former tended to increase
up to the end of the reign of Malik-Shah and subsequently to decrease.
The indirectly administered area was alienated from the direct control of
the sultan's divan and assigned t o the amirs and others as iqta's (see
p . 235 b e l o w ) . T h e s e d i d n o t c o r r e s p o n d t o a fixed a r e a , a n d t h e y v a r i e d

patronage continued under Alp-Arslan, w h o was greatly pleased with
Isfahan and treated its people w i t h m a r k e d favour. M a l i k - S h a h chose
it as his capital and did m u c h building in the city and the neighbourhood.
M a r v , too, enjoyed a special position, as the capital of Chaghri Beg
Da'ud and later of Sanjar; and Malik-Shah also built a suburb there
called Panj Dih. Toghril Beg built a n e w quarter at Baghdad on the
Tigris, which included a Friday mosque and bazaars, and was sur
rounded b y a wall. There Malik-Shah built his mosque k n o w n as

officials such as the vizier, accompanied him, and presumably the
" p r i v a t e " treasury often w e n t with him as well. T o w h a t extent a
distinction was made between the sultan's private treasury and the state
treasury is n o t clear, n o r d o w e k n o w w h a t monies w e r e paid into the
former. T h e vizier was in charge of the state treasury, but there appears
to have been a special treasurer directly under the sultan in charge of the
private treasury. M a l i k - S h a h is said t o h a v e built a fortress outside
Isfahan, k n o w n as Shahdiz (this the Batinis subsequently captured), in
which his treasury, armoury, and young slaves in training were kept
when he was absent on campaigns.1
Alp-Arslan and Malik-Shah also had stores of money in strongholds
in different parts of the kingdom, chiefly to facilitate their military
expeditions. A l p - A r s l a n is said to h a v e had a store in the fortress of
G i v near Farahan so that if he was travelling between K h u r a s a n and

w o m a n to w h o m Toghril Beg entrusted his affairs.1 Terken K h a t u n
played an active part in the struggle for the succession after her husband
Malik-Shah's death. Some of the wives had their o w n divans and
viziers, and were w o m e n of substance; Sanjar's mother, for instance,
had her o w n mamluks.2 It appears to have been usual for the sultans'
wives to have personal estates. Simirum w a s part of the pension of

instances of a sultan's granting iqta's to Saljuq w o m e n and to w o m e n
w h o married into the Saljuq house. For example, when Toghril Beg
m a r r i e d the caliph's d a u g h t e r in 454/1062, h e assigned to h e r B a ' q u b a
and all that his late wife had held in Iraq. After putting d o w n the
rebellion of Qara-Arslan in K i r m a n and reinstating him in the province,
Alp-Arslan allocated to Qara-Arslan's daughters, in response to their

dition to the marriage alliances made with caliphs, there were numerous
marriages between Saljuqs and members of former local ruling houses
such as the 'Uqailids, the Buyids, K a k u y i d s , Mazyadids, and others.
M e m b e r s of the bureaucracy, the religious classes, and learned m e n
frequented the court, but except for the sultan's private household, it
was essentially a military court, composed, f r o m the reign of A l p
Arslan onwards, mainly of amirs and members of the standing army
('askar). T h o s e a m i r s w h o h e l d " a d m i n i s t r a t i v e " i q t a ' s ( s e e p . 233
below) often found it necessary to have their agents at court to keep them
informed of current developments and to watch over their interests.
In addition, there were numbers of hostages taken from various tribal
groups—Turkmen, Kurds, Shabankara, and others—and from former
ruling families, and they remained at court as sureties against the
rebellion of their relatives.

not originally equal to that of the free-born, but they could and did
attain to the highest positions in the state, and then they themselves
aquired mamluks. In some cases b o t h slaves and freedmen married into
the royal house. T h e atabegate is further p r o o f that n o social stigma
attached to the slave or freedman from the time of Malik-Shah on.
W h e t h e r this was the case in the early days of Saljuq expansion, h o w
ever, is n o t clear. Isra'il b. Saljuq, w h e n he sent a message to his family

often granted his possessions to one of the mamluk's descendants.
F r e e d o m w a s b o u g h t b y the m a m l u k , given b y the sultan, o r else
usurped; and if a mamluk attained to a position of p o w e r he became
virtually free. M a n y of the later sultans, w h o came to the throne in
extreme youth, were dominated b y the amirs. E v e n Sanjar, if Bundari
is t o b e believed, fell u n d e r the influence o f successive m a m l u k s , w h o m
he singled out for special favour. A t least t w o of them are alleged to
h a v e been m u r d e r e d o n his orders after they fell f r o m favour.
The amirs were divided broadly into three groups: those at the
sultan's c o u r t ; " l a n d e d " amirs, i.e. those holding " a d m i n i s t r a t i v e "
iqta's; and "wandering" amirs, w h o o w e d no permanent allegiance to
anyone, but m o v e d about the empire serving different leaders and taking
possession of districts as opportunity arose. T h e grouping of the amirs
was not constant, however. Those at court frequently changed, and the
distinction between a "landed" and a "wandering" amir was not
fixed; t h u s a w a n d e r i n g a m i r w h o u s u r p e d p o s s e s s i o n o f a d i s t r i c t a n d
was then confirmed in his possession of it b y the sultan became a
landed amir. A s a class the amirs had n o c o m m u n i t y of interest. A p a r t
from rare instances their jealousies prevented close co-operation among
them except f o r a limited time. Just as the sultan used marriage alliances
to strengthen his position, so the amirs b y intermarriage among them
selves and with the ruling house sought to strengthen their o w n
position. Their power, relative to that of the sultan on the one hand
and the bureaucracy on the other, increased noticeably after the reign
of Malik-Shah. They were quick to resent any attempt to reimpose
control over them, and their disobedience after the accession of
M a h m u d b. M u h a m m a d was a marked feature of the times.

in the position of the vizier, as well as the increased militarization of
the state.
Nizam al-Mulk describes the functions of the hajib in terms of those

hajib was normally a Turkish amir and the men under him military
slaves. He was therefore concerned with the maintenance of military

A m o n g the sultan's most important functions—and in this the
traditions of the steppe and of Islamic government coincided—was to
judge. Both traditions required that he should be accessible to his
p e o p l e . H i s c h i e f m e d i u m a s a j u d g e w a s t h e mazalim c o u r t , w h i c h ,
according to Islamic theory, it was his prerogative to hold. This court
was also the main channel of contact between the sultan and his subjects,
t h o u g h its effectiveness as such w a s limited. T h e procedure o f the court
and its rules of evidence differed f r o m those of the shar'l courts: i.e. it
was necessary that the man w h o presided over the mazalim court
should possess the p o w e r to exercise his functions and to apply the
rules of justice, w h i c h w a s not the case w i t h the qadi, w h o presided

M a l i k - S h a h is also alleged to h a v e given justice personally. N i z a m
al-Mulk maintained that it was indispensable for the ruler to hold a
mazalim court twice a week to exact redress f r o m the unjust, to dispense
justice, and to listen to the w o r d s of his subjects without an inter
mediary.1 This recommendation, however, was based on expediency
rather than o n a l o v e of justice. " A l w a y s " , states N i z a m al-Mulk,
"there will be many persons at the court demanding redress for
injustice, and if they do not receive an answer they will go away, and
foreigners and e n v o y s w h o c o m e to the court a n d see this complaining
and disturbance will think that great tyranny takes place at this court."2
T h e majority o f the Saljuq sultans, h o w e v e r , in all probability
delegated their function of presiding over the mazalim court to the
vizier or the qadi and in the provinces to the great amirs and Saljuq
maliks w h o held large areas as " administrative" iqta's a n d often in
turn delegated their functions to their representatives. Thus under the
Saljuqs as under earlier rulers the mazalim court became, not an ex
ceptional appeal to the sultan in person, but an everyday application to
his representative to be dealt with according to a settled practice.3 T h e
general tendency was for the mazalim jurisdiction relative to the shar'l
courts to extend. M a n y of the cases c o m i n g before the mazalim court
were probably concerned with the collection of taxes and general

army in person. After the death of Malik-Shah, with the accession of
y o u n g boys to the throne, this w a s not always the case. A s a result the
ties between the sultan and the a r m y w e r e weakened, and the soldiers
tended more and more to give their loyalty to their immediate com
manders rather than to the sultan. Desertions in the later period became
relatively frequent. M o r e o v e r the jealousies and quarrels of the amirs

of the standing army was formed by mamluks and freedmen. O n
campaigns they were joined by contingents furnished by the amirs and
b y tribal auxiliaries. T h e armies of the amirs w e r e also in m a n y cases
composed round a nucleus of slave troops. The mamluks and freedmen
of the amirs and others, if they did not pass on the death of their
masters to their heirs, were sometimes incorporated into the royal
'askar, forming a division k n o w n b y the name of their late master.
Throughout the Saljuq empire there were also bodies of unemployed
soldiery, w h o were ready to join the standard of any leader in the hope
of plunder. Their existence facilitated the assembling of an a r m y at
short notice, but it also made easy the rebellion of discontented maliks
and amirs.
For the most part the mamluks of the standing army were Turks w h o
had been captured or bought on the eastern frontiers of the Islamic
world. A number of Georgians, Greeks, and Armenians, w h o had
been captured on the western frontiers—or, like some of the Turks,
were the children of such captives—were also enrolled in the standing
army. M a n y of the m a m l u k s w e r e carefully trained to fulfil their
various functions, w h i c h w e r e administrative as well as military.1
The most important group in the army after the Turks, however, were
the Dailamites, w h o were chiefly infantry, whereas the Turks were
cavalry. Nizam al-Mulk advocated that the army should be "mixed",
half Turkish and half Dailamite. In practice, although the army was
composed of different elements, the Turkish greatly predominated.

Tribal auxiliaries w e r e provided mainly b y Turkmen. There w e r e
also K u r d s , A r a b s , and Shabankara. Quite apart f r o m the family ties
between Saljuqs and T u r k m e n , it w a s a matter of m o m e n t f o r the sultan
to treat them well, because, in addition to their being a useful reinforce
ment to his army, they w e r e a potential source of strength for the
enemy. They were extremely mobile and could assemble in a short
space of time. Their guiding motive was plunder. Tribal auxiliaries
w e r e in some cases employed b y the amirs, and b y local rulers such as
the Mazyadids.
The chief weapon of the army was the b o w and arrow. This the
cavalry used f r o m the saddle, shooting without dismounting or halting.

iqta's for long periods, lest a rival should attack their possessions during
their absence or the sultan should assign them to some other amir.

joined Tekish in his rebellion. Nizam al-Mulk complains of an attempt
made by one of Malik-Shah's entourage, probably towards the end of
his reign, to induce him to economize on military expenditure and cut
d o w n the size of his army. He points out that the strength of the empire
lay in proportion to the strength of the sultan's army, and that if men
were dismissed they would be a potential centre of disorder and
rebellion.1 Generally speaking, it w o u l d seem that in the later period
t h e standing a r m y decreased a n d n u m b e r e d o n l y 10-15,000. A g a i n s t
this the n u m b e r of troops mustered b y the amirs tended to increase.
The army was accompanied by a military bazaar and a host of camp
followers. B e r k - Y a r u q , w h e n he came t o Isfahan in J u m a d a I 495/1102,
w a s r e p o r t e d t o h a v e b e e n a c c o m p a n i e d b y 15,000 h o r s e s a n d 100,000
camp followers. T h e a r m y did n o t always m o v e w i t h its followers,
however. W h e n Alp-Arslan marched against the Byzantines and
defeated t h e m at M a n t z i k e r t in 463/1071, f o r example, he sent his
baggage and women to Tabriz.
T h e provisioning of the a r m y as it m o v e d t h r o u g h the country was
a matter of n o small difficulty. N i z a m al-Mulk recommended that
fodder and stores should be kept at different places in the country
through which the ruler was likely to pass with his army. Land was to
be acquired in the n e i g h b o u r h o o d , and its produce, w h e n n o t required
by the army, was to be sold and the proceeds remitted to the treasury.
U n d e r Malik-Shah this plan w a s followed to some extent; later it
probably fell into disuse. W h e r e a s M a l i k - S h a h does not appear to h a v e
suffered any major obstacle to the provisioning of his army, the later
sultans encountered difficulties.
The pay of the standing army and of the amirs w h o provided
contingents for the royal army was controlled by the Military Inspec

department of the central divan (see below). T h e y w e r e paid partly b y
cash and partly b y drafts on the revenue2 and b y iqta's. Nizam al-Mulk
urged that the wages of the soldiers w h o did not have iqta's should be
held liquid, that they should be paid at the right time, and if possible
by the sultan in person. In practice their pay was often in arrears, though

2 Bundari states that Nizam al-Mulk would allot to a soldier {jundT) 1,000 dinars annually, half of which would be on a town in Asia Minor (Rum) and half on a place in the most distant part of Khurasan; and that the total would be paid immediately without any charge (p. 55). Cf. also Akbbdr al-daulat al-Saljuqiyyay p. 68. Houtsma thinks, probably rightly, that i ,000 dinars is a scribe's error for 100 dinars.

a part of it was c o m m o n l y given to them at the outset of a campaign.
A f t e r the death of M a l i k - S h a h difficulties in financing the a r m y became
m o r e frequent; and insubordination in the a r m y was especially notice
able f r o m this time onwards. This stringency was due partly to the
fact that there was a decrease in the directly administered area, and
hence a decrease in the revenue coming into the treasury; and partly
to the fact that civil w a r had b r o u g h t about a general decline in
p r o s p e r i t y . I n a d d i t i o n t o t h e i r r e g u l a r p a y t h e s o l d i e r s r e c e i v e d ad hoc
payments such as accession gratuities and presents o n special occasions,
as well as a share o f the b o o t y taken in battle.
Bundari's well-known statement that Nizam al-Mulk introduced the
practice o f granting iqta's to the soldiery is manifestly untrue. Such
grants were already common practice under the Buyids. W h a t Nizam
al-Mulk probably did was to regularize the practice and in some measure
to unify the "military" and the "administrative" iqta'. Both existed
under the Buyids, but the "administrative" iqtac was the exception
then, whereas under the Saljuqs it became the dominant type of iqta'
and the most important institution of their empire. In order to appre
ciate its nature and the w a y it developed, the earlier history of the iqtac
must be briefly considered.
The iqtac emerged in the fourth/tenth century against a background
of change in the economic and social environment (though not in the
purpose of government) of the 'Abbasid caliphate. A s it evolved, in

ceased to be sufficient to pay the a r m y leaders and their troops. A s the
revenue came in with increasing irregularity, the practice grew of
assigning the taxes, not to the tax-farmers, but to the military them
selves.

O n c e a military leader was assigned the right to collect the taxes of a
large area, it became relatively easy for h i m to establish his semi
independence. M o r e o v e r , w h e n the taxes still failed to c o m e in regu
larly, rights o v e r the land itself w e r e then assigned to him: in other
words, the tax-farm swallowed up the land-revenue system and in turn
became assimilated to the provincial government. These grants to
the military w e r e k n o w n as iqta'. T h e militarization of the state w a s
marked not only in Iraq and the neighbourhood under the Buyids, but
also in the east under the Samanids and m o r e especially under the
Ghaznavids. The growing tendency of the military to be occupied, not
only with the arts of war, but also with administration, obscured to
some extent the true nature of the iqta' system, the origins of which
were bureaucratic and not feudal.

probably made mainly on kharaj land and not 'ushr land, though by that
time the distinction between these t w o types had become somewhat
blurred. They were thus an extension of the ighar and tasvij rather than
the original iqta'. In fact, jurists such as M a w a r d i distinguish between
the new and the old iqta' (which were properly grants of 'ushr land), c a l l i n g t h e l a t t e r iqfd* al-tamlik a n d t h e f o r m e r iqtd6 al-istighldl. T h e
difference between them was that the iqtac al-tamlik was a grant of
ownership, its purpose the extension of cultivation, whereas the iqta'
al-istighlal w a s a grant of the usufruct, and its purpose was remuneration
for services.
Under the Buyids the men to w h o m the new type of iqtac, the
military iqta', was granted did not normally live in the area granted to
them, but merely sent their agents to collect their revenues. In theory
these iqta's were not hereditary but w e r e subject to periodic redistri
bution. The holder had to perform military service and was theoretically
subject to detailed regulations and inspection. The amirs w h o held these
iqta's had no responsibility for the payment of the soldiery, w h o
1 'Ushr land was land which paid land tax at the rate of one-tenth of the produce; kharaj land paid at a higher rate. The classification of lands on the basis of these two rates was an intricate problem; see F. Lokkegaard, Islamic Taxation in the Classic Period (Copen hagen, 1950), pp. 72 ff.

over, the tendency for the functions of the provincial governor, the
provincial military commander, the tax-collector, the tax-farmer, and
the muqta' to be combined in one person led to the emergence of large
properties virtually independent of the central government. The ten

their provinces b y w a y of iqta's; in such cases they combined in these

province.1 There w e r e also cases under the Buyids w h e r e a muqta' w a s

Saljuq period.2

sources to cover a number of different types of grants. Thus it was used t o m e a n ( i ) a grant o n the revenue, o r a grant o f land for (a) military service and (b) i n lieu o f salary; (2) the grant o f a district, and jurisdiction over it, to Saljuq maliks, amirs, and others, which was virtually a grant of provincial government; (3) a tax farm (though this is more often referred t o as daman); and (4) the grant o f (a) a personal estate and (b) an allowance or pension. Iqta's to the sultan's wives and other Saljuq women, to the caliph, and to members of the religious classes fall into the last category. It must not be assumed, however, that all iqta's fall neatly into one or other of these categories, or that all iqta's belonging to the same category necessarily conformed to the same pattern. There was no doubt a general tendency to follow accepted precedent, which resulted in a general similarity of usage, but this does not exclude the possibility of a variety of special provisions according to circumstances. Nizam al-Mulk, discussing the relations of the muqta's to the population, states:
Let those w h o hold tqfd's, k n o w that they have no authority over the peasants beyond this, that they should take the due amount which has been assigned to them from the peasants in a good way, and that when they have done so the peasants shall be secure in their persons, and their money, wives, children, goods, and farms shall be secure and the muqta's have no claim over t h e m . . . Let the muqta's k n o w that the country and the subjects (ra'iyyat) all belong to the sultan. T h e muqta's, w h o are set over them, and the governors {ydlidn) are Hke sbahtias in relation to the subjects, as the king is to others [i.e. those subjects not on assigned lands].1
Though it would seem from the above that Nizam al-Mulk has pri marily in mind the "military" iqtac, his coupling of the muqta' with the vali suggests that he was discussing something rather different from the "military" iqtac of the Buyid period. In another passage he states that if attention were ever drawn to the ruin and dispersal of the inhabitants of any district, the matter should at once be investigated and the c o n d i t i o n o f the m u q t a ' and 'dmil inquired into, in order t o p r e v e n t the land becoming waste, the peasants dispersing, and money being levied unjustly.2 This suggests that the idea of increasing cultivation had to some extent been carried over from the old iqta' al-tamlik to the new type of iqta' which was developing under the Saljuqs; and, further, that the "military" and the "administrative" iqta' were becoming assimilated to each other. This is borne out by Bundari's statement
1 Siyasat-Nama, p. 28. 2 Ibid. p. 119.



INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE SALJUQ EMPIRE
that Nizam al-Mulk, seeing the disorder of the country and the irregularity of the payment of taxes, assigned the country to the soldiers (ajndd), handing over to them its produce so that they had an interest in its prosperity.1 It is thus difficult in Saljuq times to make a clear distinction between the "military" and the "administrative" iqta'. All grants were entirely a matter of grace, and revocable at will by the sultan. Grants of "administrative" iqta's to Saljuq maliks do not differ materially from similar grants to the great amirs, though in the former it is possible to see the influence of the custom of the steppe, according to which the ruling khan did not exercise power, to the exclusion of the other members of his family but rather as the head of a council of elders. The Saljuq malik normally resided in the area assigned to him. These grants were not intended to be permanent, but a tendency arose for different branches of the family to regard certain districts as their own iqtac. In the case of the Saljuqs of Kirman, Rum, and Syria, this led to the establishment of three independent kingdoms. When he appointed Malik-Shah as his vali 'ahd in 458/1066, AlpArslan gave iqta's to various members of his family: Inanch Yabghu received Mazandaran; Sulaiman b. Da'ud received Balkh, his sons Arslan-Arghu and Arslan-Shah were given Khwarazm and Marv respectively; Alp-Arslan's brother Ilyas received Chaghaniyan and Tukharistan; Mas'ud b. Er-Tash had Baghshur, and Maudud b. Er-Tash had Isfizar. On his deathbed Alp-Arslan made further assignments. He bestowed upon his son Ayaz what had formerly belonged to Da'ud in Balkh, and he also earmarked for him 500,000 dinars; but the fortresses in those districts he assigned to Malik-Shah, and he gave Fars and Kirman to Qavurt b. Da'ud, allocating to him also a sum of money. These and similar grants made by later sultans are referred to in the sources as iqta's. They were in all cases simply delegations of authority and did not contain any implication of vassalage or permanent rights, though these were sometimes usurped. The duties delegated were the normal duties of a Muslim ruler, including the patronage of religion and of the religious classes, preservation of public order, holding or supervising the mazalim court, collecting taxes, and paying salaries and allowances. In some cases the duty of consultation was also enjoined upon the malik. This derived from two sources: the custom of the steppe and the Quranic principle of "Consult them in affairs". The

terms of the grant varied. In most cases complete financial control was given to the malik, in the sense that all revenue was collected by him. He was usually instructed not to increase taxation, and was in any case limited in this by local custom and Islamic theory. The degree to which he could sub-assign the area under him varied. Sanjar, reinstating Mahmud b. Muhammad after his rebellion in 513/1119, appears to have acted exceptionally when he retained Ray as a precaution in case Mahmud should rebel again.1 During the reign of Mas'ud b. Muham mad, Ray was also excluded from the area he ruled, and was assigned by Sanjar to al-Muqarrab Jauhar. It was subsequently held by the latter's mamluk 'Abbas, whom Mas'ud killed in 541/1146-7. Similarly, the assignments made to the great amirs, which were also delegations of some or all the ruler's normal duties within the area assigned, are usually referred to in the sources as iqta's when they are in the western provinces, and their holders are called muqta's. Occasion ally the term vdli is used, apparently as a synonym for muqta'. In Khurasan, Gurgan, and in the neighbouring districts, these grants during Sanjar's reign were known by the traditional terms for a provincial government, vtlaya, 'amal^ riydsa, and niydba, and the term iqta' appears to have been used in a more specific sense, corresponding rather to the "military" iqta'. Each iqta' was supposed to bring in a definite sum of money, in return for which the holder furnished the ruler with a specified number of troops; and a register of the iqta's and of the number of troops the muqta's were supposed to furnish was kept in the divan. Thus the diploma issued by Sanjar's divan to Adud al-Dln for the office of governor of Gurgan required him to look carefully into the iqta's according to their original descriptions, and to recover for the divan anything that had been fraudulently incorporated into someone's iqta' without his or the sultan's permission. Any grant that had fallen into disuse was not to be conferred on a new holder without the sultan's order.2 In the early period of Saljuq expansion much of the country was administered by the former local ruling families who acted first as Saljuq tributaries, and finally, so far as they retained part or the whole of their possessions, as Saljuq governors or muqta's. These governor

ships, like the grants to the amirs, are also called in the sources iqta's, and the conditions under which they were granted were virtually the same as for the amirs.1 From the death of Malik-Shah, an increasing amount of the country was alienated from the central government as "administrative" iqta's granted to the amirs, until finally the area directly administered by the sultan became almost negligible. These grants also derived from the absolute sovereignty of the sultan and were entirely arbitrary, subject to re-grant at irregular intervals and to revocation without cause. The holder owed the obligation of obedience and service to the sultan. He was required to furnish the sultan with troops, and also with money when called upon to do so. In the event of his making fresh conquests, he was probably expected to remit something in cash or kind to the sultan. There was no obligation of protection or maintenance on the part of the sultan, nor was there a contract involving mutual fealty. The extent to which the muqta' exercised financial control varied. Nizam al-Mulk's exposition in the Siydsat-Ndma gives the impression that it was limited; and Bundari's statement, concerning Nizam alMulk's alleged practice of assigning the pay of the military on different districts (p. 55) suggests that either considerable areas of the empire were at that time directly administered, or that the central government retained control over all or some of the provincial taxes. Usually, however, despite the statement of Nizam al-Mulk, the muqta' prob ably exercised complete financial control over an " administrative" iqta'. Moreover, within his iqtac he was able to make sub-assignments to his own followers; and their relation to him was similar to that existing between him and the sultan. Amirs who attained to a status of semiindependence as local rulers freely assigned the area under their control. There were also muqta's who farmed out the taxes of some of the territory assigned to them. They usually had freedom of choice in the appointment of administrative officials in their assignments. If the muqta' held an extensive area, of necessity he appointed deputies and subordinate officials to act for him; and the fact that the muqta' was often absent from his iqta' on military campaigns with the sultan, or on the sultan's behalf, also sometimes made it necessary for him to appoint a deputy to act for him. N o means were devised by the central government to maintain

control over the "administrative" iqta' or to prevent a muqta"s in justice or rebellion except the threat of superior forces. In theory the oppressed could seek redress from the sultan, but in practice the latter was accessible only if he happened to be passing through the area or its neighbourhood. Ibn al-Athir relates a case of two men from Lower Iraq demanding redress from Malik-Shah in 485/1092 against their muqta' Khumar-Tegin, the shahna of Baghdad, who, they alleged, had extorted 1,600 dinars from them. Malik-Shah dismissed KhumarTegin from his iqta', returned the money to the plaintiffs, and gave them both an additional 100 dinars.1 Nizam al-Mulk states that the muqta' should be forbidden from preventing his subjects coming to court to demand redress, and he should be punished and his iqta' cancelled if he does so.2 Acts of usurpation were common; and as the power of the amirs increased, the grant of an "administrative" iqta' tended to become merely the recognition of an amir's possession of a district. Further, the sultan would sometimes play off one amir against another by assigning the same district to them simultaneously; and frequently an amir had to take possession of his iqta' by force. In theory the grant of an "administrative" iqta' was not hereditary; but as their power grew, a hereditary tendency appeared, and several amirs transferred their iqta's to their sons or dependants by inheritance or by disposing of them by testament. Certain court offices had particular districts attached to them as iqta's to provide for their upkeep, or else the iqta's were a special charge on the revenue of a particular district. Thus the tasb-khdna (the royal pantry) in the time of Malik-Shah was a charge on the kharaj of Khwarazm, and the jdma-khdna (Royal Wardrobe) on the revenue of Khuzistan. Atsiz, who was the tash-ddr of Malik-Shah, eventually established virtual independence in Khwarazm and founded an inde pendent dynasty. Various officials were also paid by grants of land or grants on the revenue, both also known as iqta's. A number of the shahnas of Baghdad, for instance, held Takrit as an iqta'. Wasit and Hulwan at different times were also held as an iqta' by the shahnas of Baghdad. The vizier was paid in part by iqta's (see below, p. 261). Ibn Balkhi states that in his time (i.e. during the reign of Muhammad b. Malik-Shah), Jahrum, in Fars, was part of the allowances (mavdjib) of the vail 'ahd;3 but this may have resembled the kind of iqta' granted as 1 Vol. x, p. 144. 2 Siydsat-Ndma, p. 28. 8 Fdrs-Ndma, p. 131.

a pension or allowance rather than the iqta' attached to a particular office. The iqta' system did not in itself involve decentralization or even a relaxation of the authority of the central government. Under a strong ruler it contributed to the strength and cohesion of the state, but under a weak ruler it led to political disintegration. When, after the death of Malik-Shah, the muqta's began to establish their semi-independence by usurpation, the link between the sultan and his subjects became increasingly tenuous. Thus by abuse the system contributed to the political disintegration of the empire, but not necessarily to its economic decay, since the individual muqta' was restrained, by self-interest if nothing else, from reducing his iqta' to a state of ruin; indeed, he often succeeded in transforming it into a virtually hereditary domain. Also by abuse the system contributed to the growth of "private" armies, and to the virtual subjection of the peasantry; but against this the muqta' protected them from both the depredations of neighbours and the extortions of government officials. After the death of Malik-Shah it became increasingly common for iqta's to be granted to maliks who were still boys, in which case the land was administered by the malik's atabeg. The atabegate was an institution belonging especially to the Saljuq period, though its origins are possibly to be sought in the social organization and customs of the Turkmen. The first well-attested grant of the title atabeg is the one to Nizam al-Mulk by Malik-Shah when he succeeded to the throne.1 According to the Akhbar al-daulat al-Saljiiqiyya, Alp-Arslan also had an atabeg during the lifetime of his father, in the person of Qutb al-Din Kul-Sarigh ( PQizil-Sarigh) ;2 and Ibn Khallikan states that when Chaghri Beg Da'ud appointed Nizam al-Mulk to look after Alp-Arslan, he said to the boy, " consider him as a parent and do not disobey his counsels " . 3 If this was so, it would seem that the atabegate in its original form was primarily a social institution, and that the later and more familiar form was an aberration due to the militarization of the state. All or most of the later atabegs, with the exception of cAli b. Abi 'All al-Qummi, who was one of Berk-Yaruq's atabegs, were amirs. Normally, too, the atabeg was married to the mother of the malik who was entrusted to his care. The atabegate as it developed under the Saljuqs had two aspects,

asocial and a political. The atabeg was in charge of the prince's education. This presumably was the object of the appointment of 'Ali b. Abi cAli al-Qummi as atabeg to Berk-Yaruq—who was not, contrary to the usual custom, given an iqta' during the reign of Malik-Shah. If a young malik was assigned a province or district the atabeg attached to him was responsible for its administration and therefore it was natural that those appointed to the office were almost without exception Turkish amirs. In its political aspect, one of the objects of the atabegate was to control the malik and prevent his rebellion in the province assigned to him. This was probably Berk-Yaruq's dominant motive in appointing atabegs to his brothers Muhammad and Sanjar. Muhammad, however, when he felt strong enough to be independent, killed his atabeg, Qutlugh-Tegin, and took possession of Arran. Mahmud b. Muhammad, in appointing Kun-Toghdi as atabeg to his brother Toghril in 513/119-20, had apparently a similar end in view; but Kun-Toghdi, although he had instructions to bring Toghril to Mahmud, instead induced him to rebel. As the power of the amirs increased relative to that of the sultans, the atabegate came to be used, not so much to prevent the rebellion of a Saljuq prince, as to retain the nominal allegiance of a powerful or rebellious amir; and such conquests as the latter made were nominally under the sultan's ultimate sovereignty. This was the general tendency from the reign of Muhammad b. Malik-Shah onwards. As it became more marked, the atabeg was often made the nominal as well as the actual governor of the province, and the malik was sent with him only as a matter of form. Thus in 502/1108-9 Fars was assigned to Chavli Saqao and not to his two-year-old ward Chaghri b. Muhammad. The career of Chavli Saqao is typical of that of the great amirs of the time, and illustrates the prevailing instability, the mutual jealousies of the amirs, and the growing weakness of the sultan vis-a-vis the amirs. Chavli Saqao was a native of the district lying between Ram Hurmuz and Arrajan, and in due course he established himself on the borders of Fars and Khuzistan. Muhammad b. Malik-Shah after his accession sent Maudud b. Altun-Tegin to besiege him, and after seven months Chavli submitted and came to Muhammad in Isfahan. In 500/1106 he was assigned Mosul and other districts, which were then in the possession of Chokermish. Chavli set out for Mosul and captured Chokermish near Irbil. The people of Mosul thereupon made Zangi b. Chokermish gover nor in his father's stead, and wrote for help to Sadaqa, the Mazyadid, Qilich-Arslan, and to Bursuqi, who was then shahna of Baghdad.



INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE SALJUQ EMPIRE
Chavli laid siege to Mosul, but retired to Sinjar on the approach of Qilich-Arslan. There he was joined by Il-Ghazi b. Artuq and by a number of Chokermish's followers; later he joined Ridwan and took Rahba. He then defeated Qilich-Arslan on the Khabur River and returned to Mosul, the gates of which were opened to him. Having established him self there he withdrew his allegiance from Muhammad b. Malik-Shah; and when Muhammad made preparations to march against Sadaqa in 501/1107-8, Chavli, together with Il-Ghazi b. Artuq, sent an offer of support to Sadaqa. Meanwhile the spoliation of Chavli's domains was proposed by Muhammad to the Bani Bursuq, Maudud b. Altun-Tegin, and to a number of other amirs. Chavli, accordingly having prepared Mosul for siege, left his wife to defend the city and himself went to collect reinforcements. A t Nisibin he was joined, somewhat un willingly, by Il-Ghazi b. Artuq, and also by Abu Najm and Abu Kamil Mansur, the sons of Sadaqa. He agreed to go with them to Hilla and they decided to make Bektash b. Tutush b. Alp-Arslan their spokes man. But the Ispahbud Sabavu, who had subsequently joined them, advised Chavli to go again to Syria because the sultan was in or near Iraq. Chavli accepted his advice. Allying himself to Baldwin of Edessa and Jocelin, he went to Syria but was defeated by Tancred in 502/1108. Muhammad b. Malik-Shah meanwhile sent Husain b. Qutlugh-Tegin to Chavli to win back his allegiance. Chavli agreed to submit if the siege of Mosul was raised, and he offered to send his son to the sultan's court as a hostage. However, Maudud, who was besieging Mosul, refused to raise the siege, and Mosul fell shortly afterwards. Realizing that he could not hope for success in Syria or the Jazireh, Chavli then deter mined to go to Muhammad b. Malik-Shah in the hope that Husain b. Qutlugh-Tegin would intercede for him. He reached Isfahan, sur rendered Bektash b. Tutush to Muhammad, and made his peace with him. Muhammad then sent Chavli to Fars as atabeg to his son Chaghri. Fars at the time was in a state of disorder and not under the effective control of the sultan; hence the sultan in sending Chavli to Fars was not running any immediate risk of renewed rebellion, since Chavli would first have to restore obedience in the province. In fact, Chavli was largely successful in subduing the Shabankara, who had reduced the Shapur district of Fars to a state of ruin and disorder, and in bringing back a considerable measure of prosperity to the province. He died in Fars in 510/1116-17. As the political aspect of the atabegate began increasingly to dominate

its social aspect, a malik was sometimes entrusted to a succession of different atabegs, as happened, for example, with Mas'üd b. Muhammad. Or an amir was put in charge of a succession of maliks. Qasim al-Daula Aq-Sonqur Bursuqi is a case in point. He was originally a mamlük of Bursuq, who was made shahna of Baghdad by Toghril Beg in 452/ 1060-1 and subsequently served Alp-Arslan, Malik-Shäh, and BerkYaruq. Aq-Sonqur Bursuqi was made shahna of Baghdad by Muhammad b. Malik-Shäh in 498/1105. After the death of Maudüd b. Altun-Taq, the muqta' of Mosul, he was assigned Mosul and the Jazireh in 508/ 1114-15, appointed atabeg to Mas'üd b. Muhammad, and ordered to organize a jihäd(holy war) against the Franks in Syria. In 509/1115-16 Muhammad b. Malik-Shäh assigned Mosul to Cha'ush Beg, who also became atabeg to Mas'üd. Bursuqi retired to Rahba, which he held as an iqtac. Muhammad b. Malik-Shäh died in 511/1117. In the following year Bursuqi was appointed shahna of Baghdad by Mahmud b. Muhammad, but Mengü-Bars was appointed to the same office almost immediately afterwards. Mas'üd then assigned Marägheh to Bursuqi as an iqtä' in addition to Rahba. Dubais b. Sadaqa the Mazyadid mean while urged Cha'ush Beg to rebel against Mahmud, to seek the kingdom in the name of Mas'üd, and also to seize Bursuqi. The latter, learning of this plan, joined Mahmüd. For a brief period the khutba was read in Äzarbäijän, the Jazireh, and Mosul in the name of Mas'üd. Battle was joined between him and Mahmüd in 514/1120 and Mas'üd was defeated, after which Mahmüd sent Bursuqi to Mas'üd with a pardon. In 515/1121 Bursuqi was assigned Mosul by Mahmüd and was ordered to undertake a jihäd against the Franks. The following year Bursuqi was given Wäsit as an additional iqtä', together with the office of shahna of Baghdad; he was also reappointed atabeg to Mascüd and married to Mascüd's mother, who had been seized by Mengü-Bars on the death of Muhammad b. Malik-Shäh in 511/1117 before the expiry of her 'idda (the legal period of retirement assigned to a widow before she may marry again).1 Seven years later, Bursuqi was dismissed from the office of shahna of Baghdad at the caliph's request. Mahmüd then made him atabeg to one of his sons, sent him back to Mosul, and ordered him once again to undertake a jihäd against the Franks. After taking Aleppo he returned to Mosul, where he was assassinated by a Bätini in 520/1126.

INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE SALJUQ EMPIRE
While the sultan thus hoped to retain the nominal allegiance of the great amirs through the atabegate, they, on the other hand, saw in it a means to establish their virtual independence. In view of the fact that sovereignty was considered inherent in the Saljuq family, it was important for an amir to secure the person of a Saljuq malik in whose name he could act. The atabegate provided him with a ready means of doing so. Further, in view of the jealousies among the amirs, it was easier for them to establish virtually independent kingdoms under the guise of atabegates in the outlying provinces than to dominate the sultanate itself, and there are cases of amirs demanding or taking forcible possession of some malik, with the nominal acquiescence of the sultan, in order to increase their prestige. Thus Mengii-Bars,1 having made himself master of Fars in succession to Qaracha al-Saqi (SaljuqShah b. Muhammad's atabeg, whom Sanjar had killed in 526/1132) wrote to Toghril b. Muhammad and demanded that he send his son Alp-Arslan to him; if his demand was met, he offered to recognize Toghril as sultan. In due course Toghril sent Alp-Arslan to Mengii-Bars. 'Imad al-Din Zangi, who had originally been in the service of Bursuqi, was another case in point. He made himself master of Mosul in 521/1127 on the death of Bursuqi's son 'Izz al-Din. T w o Saljuq maliks were under his care. One he had captured from Dubais b. Sadaqa the Mazyadid, to whom the malik had been entrusted.2 The other was Alp-Arslan b. Mahmud, who was known as al-Khafaji. According to Ibn al-Athir, Zangi pretended to hold the country on behalf of the malik Alp-Arslan, in whose name he sent envoys and answered letters, awaiting the death of Mas'ud b. Muhammad, at which time he, Zangi, would assemble an army and seek the sultanate in the name of al-Khafaji.3 A s it happened Zangi died before he could put his plan into action. The fact, however, that an amir of his power and virtual independence should be found pursuing such a policy, is striking evidence of the added prestige which the possession of a Saljuq malik gave to an amir. Once an atabeg had firmly established his power, however, the dependent malik was allowed to fall into obscurity, and the atabeg, acting as a virtually independent ruler,

was killed in 513/1119-20.
2 There is some confusion in the sources over the names of these two maliks and the
events connected with them: cf. Bundari, p. 187, Ibn Khallikan, vol. 1, p. 330, and Ibn al
Athir, al-Daulat, pp. 126-7. The prince captured from Dubais was probably one of Mahmud

transmitted his province to his descendants. The political atabegate thus became a potent factor in the disintegration of the great Saljuq empire. From the reign of Mas'ud b. Muhammad on, Azarbaijan and Fars were the scene of various attempts by atabegs to establish their independence, and eventually in both provinces independent dynasties were set up. Although after the death of Malik-Shah, if not before, most of the empire was alienated in the form of iqta's from the control of the central government, there were other areas, towns and districts, where a rather different arrangement prevailed, for they were under an official known as the shahna. He was in effect a military governor appointed by the sultan or his governor. One of his main functions was to carry out the decisions of the qadfs court, when coercive force was necessary for this; and similarly to support other officials, such as the cdmil (tax-collector), in the execution of their duties. A muqta' had full control of an "ad ministrative" iqta', and he exercised by delegation virtually all the functions of the ruler. But the shahna usually had no power to appoint district officials (apart from those in his own divan), and he was concerned merely with the maintenance of order, so that the collection of taxes and the general administration could be carried on.1 The position of the shahna of Isfahan, for example, was clearly that of a military governor only. On her deathbed in 487/1094, Terken Khatun ordered the shahna of Isfahan to hold the kingdom for her son Mahmud. Various shahnas of Ray are mentioned in the sources, including 'Abbas the mamluk of al-Muqarrab Jauhar.2 Ray, like Isfahan, was at one time the Saljuq capital, and, as stated above, was retained by Sanjar in the possession of his divan. This is not to say, however, that the shahna was to be found only in directly admini stered areas.3 Exercising the functions delegated to him by the ruler, the holder of an "administrative" iqta' sometimes appointed shahnas; but generally speaking, although there are numerous references to

Preserved in the 'Ataba al-kataba is a document issued by Sanjar's divan for one Saif al-Din

puzzling statement, to the effect that the office of shahna in Juvain belonged to the divan
of Sanjar's sister Nur(?) Bilge, and was conferred upon Saif al-Din by her divan (by virtue
of the document issued by Sanjar).

shahnas in the north-eastern provinces in the time of Sanjar, references to them in the western provinces are less common. The shahna appears to have been paid by local dues levied in accordance with custom. There are occasional references in the sources to revenue farms {daman). These verged on the "administrative" iqta', but whereas the muqta' usually had complete control over the general administration of the district and maintained armed forces which he used, if called upon, in the service of the sultan, the revenue farmer was concerned only with the collection of taxes. Further, the farmer's contract was for a stipu lated period, probably one or three years. The number and size of these farms were relatively small. Most of the references are to the early period of Saljuq rule, and to the area in and around Iraq. Toghril Beg farmed Basra and Ahvaz to Hazarasp b. Bankir in 448/1056-7 for 300,000 dinars and 60,000 dinars respectively.1 In 451/1059 the farmer was changed, but in 456/1064 Basra was again in the hands of Hazarasp, and in 459/1066-7 Alp-Arslan farmed it to him together with Wasit for 300,000 dinars. In 451/1059 Wasit was farmed by Toghril Beg to a certain Abu. 'AH b. Fadlan for 200,000 dinars; and in 455/1063 to another revenue farmer for the same sum. In 452/1060-1 and 45 5/1063 Toghril Beg farmed Baghdad for three years, on the first occasion for 400,000 dinars and on the second (to a different revenue farmer) for 150,000 dinars. Malik-Shah farmed Basra first to a Jew named Ibn "Allan, and then in 472/1079-80 to Khumar-Tegin, who gave him 100,000 dinars a year and 100 horses. With Gauhar A'in, the shahna of Baghdad, Khumar-Tegin had apparently plotted the fall of Ibn 'Allan. The latter took refuge with Nizam al-Mulk. But KhumarTegin and Gauhar A'in, since they were personal enemies of Nizam al-Mulk, slandered Ibn 'Allan before the sultan and persuaded him to have the man drowned.2 Alp-Arslan also farmed Fars to Fadluya, the Shabankara leader.
For the most part the tribal groups in the Saljuq empire were not directly administered by the central government. The Kurds and Arabs, for instance, were left mainly under the local rulers or else came under a muqta'. The question of direct administration did not therefore arise. The same is largely true of parts of Tabaristan. The Shabankara in
1 Ibn al-Athir, vol. ix, p. 422; Fdrs-Ndma, p. 121. Ibn al-Jauzi states that Kunduri
farmed these districts to Hazarasp for 300,000 sultdm dinars (vol. VIII, pp. 168-9).

(Ibn al-Athir, vol. ix, p. 454).

Fars were also under their own leaders for much of the period until they were temporarily subdued by Chavli Saqao. The most important tribal group as regards both numbers and influence was the Turkmen. But because of their numbers and the Saljuqs' early relation with them, their control presented a special problem. Throughout the period they tended to continue moving in a westerly direction. Alp-Arslan's policy was to employ them in raids outside the ddr al-hldm, and many of them pushed on into Syria and Asia Minor. Others, however, remained in the provinces over which the sultan maintained control. Some were incorporated into the service of the sultan (see p. 218 above), but the majority continued to follow a nomadic or semi-nomadic existence, moving from winter to summer pastures and migrating in search of new pastures. The main concentrations of Turkmen were to be found in Iraq, the Jazireh, Azarbaijan, Gurgan, and the neighbourhood of Marv. These concentrations were not necessarily constant throughout the Great Saljuq period. The power of the sultan held the Turkmen more or less in check until the death of Malik-Shah. The weakening of the empire after his death and the dissolution of the kingdom created by Tutush in Syria restored their freedom, and within two or three years several of them had formed independent principalities.1 The fact that some of them had been officers of the sultan—Il-Ghazi b. Artuq, for example, was a shahna of Baghdad on behalf of Muhammad b. Malik-Shah in 495/1101-2—helped them to transform themselves quickly into small territorial princes when the sultan's authority declined.
The Turkmen who remained in Gurgan and the neighbourhood of Marv during the reign of Sanjar came under his central divan. The official charged with their administration was also known as a shahna. His functions were primarily to maintain order and prevent the tribes encroaching on their neighbours, and to collect from them pasture dues and other taxes due to the government. In a diploma issued by Sanjar's divan, appointing Inanch Bilge Ulugh Jandar Beg to the office of shahna of the Turkmen in Gurgan, it is recognized that they formed a special class. The jandar beg was, among his other duties, to allot pastures and water to each leader according to the number of his households and followers.2 The Ghuzz in the neighbourhood of Marv and on the borders of the

247
empire apparently regarded themselves as the special subjects of the sultan. They were difficult to control, and relations between them and Sanjar's divan were marked by a standing opposition between the settled and semi-settled population. Extortion was practised in the collection of the annual tribute of sheep, which they paid to the sultan's kitchen, and eventually they were driven to rebellion. Sanjar was then induced by his amirs to march against them, and was defeated and captured by the Ghuzz in 548/115 3-4; he remained a prisoner in their hands for three years. Although on this occasion the sultan's officials appear to have been at fault, the problem was by no means a simple one, because the Ghuzz were increasing in numbers and encroaching on the settled areas; and after the death of Sanjar in 552/1157, they overran parts of Khurasan and Kirman. In exercising his functions as judge and guardian of public order, and in delegating these functions in the provinces to the muqta's, the sultan acted through the dargah. A whole range of other functions, including in particular the collection of taxes, was exercised by the sultan through the central divan, the main department of the bureau cracy. In the dargah, which was militarized and composed largely of Turkish amirs, the sultan was accessible to his subjects for the redress of grievances; in the divan, which was mainly staffed by men who were not Turks and who had inherited the administrative traditions of the preceding dynasties, he came into contact with his subjects in a different way: namely, over the collection of taxes. He delegated his functions in the divan to the vizier, who at the height of his power supervised all aspects of the administration, secular and religious, and was more than just the head of the financial administration. Nizam alMulk envisaged him as the keystone of the empire. "When the vizier is of good conduct and judgement", he states, "the kingdom flourishes and the army and subjects are contented, quiet and wealthy, and the ruler happy at heart; but when the vizier is of evil conduct, indescribable confusion appears in the kingdom, and the ruler is always distressed and afflicted in mind and the kingdom disturbed."1
The relationship between the dargah and the central divan was not clearly formulated. The connecting link between them until the decline of the vizierate was the vizier himself. 'Amid al-Mulk Kunduri, Toghril Beg's vizier, and Nizam al-Mulk both had direct access to the sultan; but under the later sultans, as stated above, the amir hajib
1 Siyasat-Ndma, pp. 18-19.



INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE SALJUQ EMPIRE
248
appears to have been to some extent interposed between them. So far as the vizier conducted the sultan's relations with foreign rulers and with the caliphate, he acted in some measure as an official of the dargah. When the caliph gave an audience to Malik-Shah and his amirs in 479/1086-7, Nizam al-Mulk presented the amirs to the caliph. On the accession of a new caliph it was often, though not invariably, the vizier who gave the oath of allegiance to him on behalf of the sultan. Negotia tions for marriage alliances with the caliph were also usually carried out by the sultan's vizier. 'Amid al-Mulk Kunduri acted on behalf of Toghril Beg when he demanded the hand of the caliph's daughter; and the negotiations for the marriage of Malik-Shah's daughter to the caliph in 474/1081-2 were carried out by Nizam al-Mulk. Similarly, Kamal al-Din Abu'l Barakat al-Darguzini, Mas'ud b. Muhammad's vizier, was his vakil in the marriage of his sister Fatima to the caliph in 531/1137; and Diya' al-Mulk Ahmad b. Nizam al-Mulk, who was vizier to Muhammad b. Malik-Shah from 500/1107 to 504/1110-11, was mutavalli on behalf of the sultan's sister when she was married to the Caliph al-Mustazhir in 502/1109. When the vizier deputized for the sultan in the mazalim court, he was exercising functions that belonged to the dargah rather than to the divan. Similarly, his supervision of the religious institution was delegated to him in his capacity as the sultan's deputy, and not specific ally because he was the head of the bureaucracy, except perhaps so far as the administration of auqdf(religious endowments) was concerned. He had no power to appoint qadis, muhtasibs^ khatibs or other officials of the religious institutions, though he may have advised the sultan on the matter. The main object of his supervising the religious institutions was probably to prevent any tendency towards heresy, because this was be lieved to threaten political stability. The early sultans, Toghril Beg, Alp-Arslan, Malik-Shah, and Muhammad b. Malik-Shah, were strictly orthodox and Hanafis by rite. The vizier in the early period was usually a Hanafi or a Shafi'i. Kunduri was a fanatical Hanafi, and instituted the commination of Shi'is (rdfidis) and Ash'aris from the minbars of the mosques. Nizam al-Mulk, who was a Shafi'i, abolished this practice. Under the later sultans strict orthodoxy was not insisted upon. Anushirvan b. Khalid, who became vizier to Mahmud b. Muhammad in 521/1127 and to Mas'ud b. Muhammad in 529/1134-5, was a Shi'i; and Berk-Yaruq's mustaufi Majd al-Mulk Abu'l Fadl Baravistani Qummi was, according to Ibn al-Athir, a secret Shi'i.



INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE SALJUQ EMPIRE
249
The main function of the vizier as head of the divan was a financial one. It was his duty to regulate the sources of revenue and to increase the revenue without causing injury to agricultural prosperity. He was expected to keep the finances of the state in a healthy condition and to hold sufficient revenue in reserve to meet emergencies. The revenue of the empire derived from ordinary and extraordinary taxes, and from various other sources. Ordinary taxes comprised (a) canonical taxes: namely, kharaj (land tax), pasture taxes (mard'z), and jkga (poll-tax on members of the protected communities, the dhimmis); and (b) uncanonical taxes (mukus), such as those on merchandise, tolls and customs, and a variety of dues (rusum), including those levied for the payment of officials. Extraordinary taxes consisted of levies made for specific purposes. These were of two kinds: cesses imposed on existing taxes (e.g. for defaulters, arrears, and chipped and broken coins), which in the course of time tended to become assimilated to the original tax; and ad hoc levies, which were often extremely burden some. Because Nizam al-Mulk thought it necessary to state in the Siydsat-Ndma that the taxes should not be demanded before harvest time, it may be inferred that they were, in fact, not infrequently demanded in advance—a practice that caused much hardship. Diplomas issued to officials concerned in tax collection, i.e. to provincial governors and others, frequently included instructions that the taxes should be levied only at the fixed rates and at the proper time. Since, however, the assessment was sometimes made in one kind of dinar and paid in currency dinars, by manipulating the conversion rate of one dinar to another it was possible to raise the amount of the tax without actually raising the nominal rate at which it was levied. The land tax was assessed in one of three ways, by measurement {misdhd)) as a proportionate share of the crop {muqdsamd)y or at a fixed sum {muqdta'd). It was paid in cash and kind. Alp-Arslan is said to have levied kharaj in two annual instalments. The Akhbdr al-daulat al-Saljuqiyya records that he was satisfied with the original kharaj {al-khardj aJ-as/t), i.e. the ordinary or original assessment to which additional taxes had not been added, or which had not been raised by a manipulation of the conversion rates. Pasture taxes were levied on the nomadic or semi-nomadic population in one of two ways: either (i) they were based on the tent or family or on the number of head of stock owned, or (2) the community was assessed at a lump sum. Poll-taxes did not form an important item of revenue in Saljuq times. After Alp

Arslan took Ani, the Byzantines are alleged to have agreed to pay jizya; and Alp-Arslan appointed the 'amid of Khurasan to collect this. Malik-Shah is also stated to have received jizya from the Byzantine emperor; but both these payments, in so far as they were made, were in the nature of tribute rather than actual jizya. The nature, method of assessment, and collection of uncanonical taxes varied widely throughout the empire. The matter of their levy moreover, involved a conflict between religious scruples and financial practice; attempts were made from time to time to revoke them, but never with lasting success. Malik-Shah remitted additional levies {qismat va taqsif) from the people of Isfahan;1 and in 479/1086-7 he ordered the abolition of the mukus levied on traders who handled all kinds of merchandise in Iraq and Khurasan.2 He also abolished all tolls and escort dues (khafardt) paid by travellers throughout his dominions. Muhammad b. Malik-Shah, on his arrival in Baghdad in Sha'ban 501/1108, abolished the mukus, dard'ib(? imposts), market taxes, transit dues, and other similar dues which had been levied in Iraq and all his provinces, and tablets to this effect were hung up in the markets. When he went back to Isfahan, the mukus were again levied on the merchants in Baghdad according to custom; on his return to Baghdad he re affirmed their repeal. Toghril Beg, on the other hand, reimposed the mukus and the practice of confiscating inheritances. Mahmud b. Muhammad, on the advice of his vizier Kamal al-Mulk Simirumi, also decided to reimpose the mukus in Iraq in 515/1121-2, but after the assassination of Kamal al-Mulk in the following year, he revoked the mukus and abolished the taxes that the vizier had imposed on merchants and dealers. Their abolition was brief, however, because Mas'ud b. Muhammad is recorded as having revoked the mukus in 5 33/113 8-9, and tablets to that effect were put up in the Friday mosques and markets.
Remissions of taxes were occasionally granted on special occasions or because of some natural calamity. Toghril Beg, for example, remitted the taxes of Isfahan for three years when he took the city in 443/1051. Individuals, such as members of the religious classes, were also some times given immunity from taxes as a special favour. A fairly important source of revenue was provided by confiscations

1328/1949), p. 140.
2 Ibn al-Jauzi makes no mention of this under the year 479, but states that the dard'ib
and mukus were abolished in Baghdad according to the decree of the Caliph al-Muqtadl in
480 (vol. ix, p. 39).

251
and fines. Toghril Beg confiscated 100,000 dinars and 20,000 dinars from an cAlid and a Jew respectively in Basra in 449/1057-8. Under Alp-Arslan there were said to have been no confiscations, but after the death of Malik-Shah, the mulcting of officials on their dismissal was common. This was a measure partly of the growing financial stringency, and partly of the increase in dishonesty and corruption among the official classes. Intrigue and insecurity were the normal concomitants of official life. Men of influence and power accumulated wealth to defend their personal interests against any future intrigues by their rivals, or against a loss of the sultan's favours, and those who were ambitious for office accumulated wealth in order to buy it. Through these corrupt practices many officials amassed, temporarily at least, considerable riches. Abu'l Qasim Anasabadi Darguzini, who eventually became vizier to Toghril b. Muhammad, founded his fortune when vizier to Muhammad b. Malik-Shah's amir hajib, 'All b. 'Umar. The latter alleged that on his deathbed the sultan had ordered 200,000 dinars to be distributed among his enemies and those who had com plaints against him; but when this sum was obtained from the treasury most of it was misappropriated by Darguzini. He appears to have been one of the most corrupt of the Saljuq officials, making large sums of money from confiscations and fines. Bundari states that he fined Qutlugh Rashidi, the chamberlain {itstdd al-ddr) of Mahmud b. Mu hammad, 110,000 dinars, also that he extracted from a merchant of Hamadan 30,000 dinars, and 20,000 and 70,000 dinars respectively from the ra'is of Hamadan and the ra'is of Tabriz, together with 150,000 dinars from Taj al-Din Daulatshah b. 'Ala' al-Daula and his mother and vizier. Bundari's own family also suffered at the hands of Dar guzini. He relates that his uncle 'Aziz al-Din, who was employed in the dlvdn-i istifd of Mahmud b. Muhammad, was imprisoned by Mahmud in return for 300,000 dinars from Darguzini, who also imprisoned Bundari's father and another uncle, Diya' al-Din, and seized their estates. Corruption became widespread under Muhammad b. Malik-Shah, and relatively large sums were involved. Bundari relates that a number of prominent persons wanted to make their nominee ra'is of Hamadan in place of the existing ra'is, Abu. Hashim. Accordingly they imposed a fine of 700,000 dinars upon him, besides what was confiscated from his numerous retainers. Muhammad b. Malik-Shah sent Anushirvan b. Khalid, who was then his treasurer, to collect the money. After

252
Anushirvan had paid the money into the sultan's treasury he told the sultan of the plot against Abu Hashim. Muhammad thereupon re instated him as ra'is and sent him magnificent presents and robes of honour.1 Ravandi gives a slightly different version of this incident. He alleges that Diya' al-Mulk Ahmad b. Nizam al-Mulk, Muhammad's vizier, determined to attack the ra'is and gave the sultan 500,000 dinars to hand him over, but that Abu Hashim, hearing of this, came to Isfahan and bought himself off for 800,000 dinars in return for which Muhammad handed Diya' al-Mulk over to him.2 Zain al-Mulk A b u Sa'id b. Hindu, who became mustaufi in 498/ 1104-5 during the vizierate of Sa'd al-Mulk Abu'l Mahasin Avaji, was alleged to have been extremely corrupt, and when Sa'd al-Mulk was killed in 500/1107, Muhammad b. Malik-Shah seized and imprisoned him for two years. He was subsequently reinstated and became Muhammad's vizier. But in 506/1112-13 a number of amirs conspired against him and offered to give 200,000 dinars of his wealth to the sultan's treasury if they were allowed to seize him. The sultan agreed; he was handed over to one of the amirs, put to death, and his goods plundered. When Sanjar seized Muhammad b. Fakhr al-Mulk b. Nizam al-Mulk, who was his vizier from 500/1106 to 511/1118, the sum of 1,000,000 dinars in cash, together with jewels and other possessions, was found belonging to him.3 Further sources of revenue were the money received from the buying of offices (though offices were not put up to auction as they had been in Buyid times), and also presents from those who wished to secure or regain the sultan's favours; it is probable that revenue from these sources, as well as from confiscations and fines, went for the most part into the sultan's treasury and not the public treasury. Fakhr al-Mulk b. Nizam al-Mulk gave Berk-Yaruq many presents, including tents, weapons, jewelled implements, Arab horses, hunting birds, and an armourer's shop {^arrdd-khdnd) when he joined him in 488/1095 and became vizier. Similarly in 494/1101, after defeating Muhammad b. Malik-Shah, and capturing his vizier Mu'ayyid al-Mulk b. Nizam al
1 Pp. 89-90.
2 Rabat al-utdur, pp. 162-5. ^ n al-Athir states that Abii Hashim, whose maternal grand
father was Ibn 'Abbad, the famous Buyid vizier, was extremely wealthy, and that Muhammad
b. Malik-Shah on one occasion mulcted him of 700,000 dinars. He died, according to Ibn
al-Athir, in 502/1109 (vol. x, pp. 332-3).
8 Muhammad b. Fakhr al-Mulk had apparently accepted a bribe from Arslan Shah to
induce Sanjar to abandon his march on Ghazna. Sanjar seized him on his return from Ghazna
(Ibn al-Athir, vol. x, p. 385; Bundari, p. 244).

253
Mulk, Berk-Yaruq agreed to accept the latter as his own vizier in return for ioo,ooo gold dinars; but the new sultan later regretted his decision and killed the vizier before the transaction was completed.1 Shams al-Mulk cUthman b. Nizam al-Mulk is alleged to have given his brother Diya' al-Mulk Ahmad, vizier to Muhammad b. Malik-Shah 2,000 dinars to make him 'arid al-jaish in place of Anushirvan b. Khalid. The sultan and his ministers probably exacted sums of money and presents in return for the grant of robes of honour and similar favours. Tribute was paid to the Saljuqs by various local rulers, but this was not a regular source of revenue. In the early period of expansion, in the time of Toghril Beg, the local rulers made sundry payments to the Ghuzz; these were not tribute as they are sometimes represented in the sources, but rather payments to mercenaries which naturally ceased when the Ghuzz left the district. Later as the power of the Saljuqs increased and they began to reduce the local rulers to submission, the terms imposed often included the payment of a sum of money. But in due course most of the local rulers, if they continued to possess some or all of their former territories, were absorbed into the iqtac system. Occasionally in the later period tribute was imposed on a neighbouring ruler. Malik-Shah, for example, imposed an annual tribute of 40,000 dinars on the ruler of Shirvan, but this was not regularly paid;2 and Sanjar, when he took Ghazna in 510/1116-17, settled an annual tribute of 250,000 dinars on Bahram Shah. Lastly there was the revenue from the private estates that the sultan owned in various parts of the empire, including landed estates, qanats> and real property {mustaghallaf) in towns. There is no indication of their total extent or income. In Kufa the private domains of the sultan were farmed in 452/1060 for 40,000 dinars a year. It is not clear whether the
1 Ravandi's account of this incident is as follows: Mu'ayyid al-Mulk raised the money in
a week, and it was agreed that the day after he paid it he should become vizier. However,
disputes arose between him and the officials of the treasury over the value of what he had
produced in cash and kind; and he haggled over this and annoyed them. On the next day
when the sultan was having a siesta in his tent, the tasht-ddr, thinking the sultan was asleep,
said to a group of people, "How lacking in zeal these Saljuqs arel Now he (Berk-Yaruq)
is going to make vizier again and trust a man who has given him so much trouble, who
once induced a slave of his father [i.e. the amir Unar] to seek the kingdom, and prepared
for himself an insignia of royalty, and on another occasion went to Ganja and brought out
his (the sultan's) brother [to seek the kingdom]...". The sultan heard this, came out of
his tent, sent for Mu'ayyid al-Mulk, cut off his head, and turned to the tasht-ddr and said,
" See the zeal of the Saljuqs Whereupon the tasht-ddrfledand did not dare look upon the

income from the sultan's private estates was paid into his treasury or the public treasury. So far as the revenue was collected and the estates administered by the tax collectors i^ummdl) of the dwdn-i istifd-yt mamdlik, it would seem likely that it was paid into the public treasury. The most important charge upon the revenue was the payment of the standing army and expenditure on military expeditions. Secondly, there was the upkeep of the court, which was only partly met by special levies such as the provision of sheep by the Ghuzz for Sanjar's kitchen. There were probably various other special levies of a minor kind. Cloth for robes of honour and for the various needs of the court and the army may have been partially secured by levies in kind on craftsmen, or by requiring them to carry out work for the dargah or divan as part or all of the tax demand upon them. In some cases, however, this appears to have been done against a payment of money. Ibn Ealkhi states in the Fdrs-Ndma that the weavers of Kazarun used to receive from the divan an advance on their woven cloth, the delivery of which would be made by some trusted man, the price being fixed by brokers.1 Except when they were paid by iqta', officials were largely re munerated by special dues (rusum, marsumdt)^ which were presumably paid directly to them, and in some cases collected by them personally and were not remitted to the divan although they were included in the revenue assessments. Among incidental but regular expenses there were the pensions and allowances paid to the sayyids and others of the religious classes, as well as alms given by the sultan in Ramadan. For example, Alp-Arslan gave annually 1,000 dinars in Balkh, Marv, Herat, and Nishapur, and 10,000 dinars at his court. Malik-Shah and Sanjar were both liberal in their gifts and alms. The latter on one occasion is alleged to have distributed the greater part of the contents of his treasury, giving away over 700,000 gold dinars during five consecutive days, while the value of the horses and garments he bestowed was even greater. The government revenue tended to increase up to the reign of MalikShah, when the empire achieved its greatest size, stability, and pros perity. Subsequently the revenue declined, partly because an increasing area was alienated from the control of the central government, and partly because of the growing instability. The balance between order and disorder was at all times precarious, and rapid fluctuations in local prosperity took place. Thus parts of Fars, which were reduced to a state

of decay and disorder by the depredations of the Shabankára, returned to relative prosperity under Chauli Saqao. Hamd Allah Mustaufi, who was for many years a mustaufi in the service of the Il-Khans and has left a valuable account of Persia in the latter days of the Il-Khans, states that the revenue of Fárs in Saljuq times amounted to 2,33 5,000 currency dinars, whereas in his own time it had been 2,871,200 currency dinars.1 According to Mustaufi, the revenue of'Iraq-i cAj am had been 25,200,000 odd currency dinars in Saljuq times,2 while in his day it fell to 3 5 0,000 currency dinars.3 He states on the authority of the lost Kisdlat-i Malikshahi that the total revenue of Malik-Shah was 215,000,000 gold dinars, which amounted to some 500,000,000 currency dinars.4 In spite of the depreciation in the value of the coinage, this figure appears somewhat improbable, for the entire revenue of the Islamic empire under the early 'Abbasids was only some 25 million dinars.5 Whatever reserves Malik-Shah may have accumulated during his reign were rapidly dissipated by his successors. Terken Khatun, when she went to Isfahan after her son Mahmüd was proclaimed sultan distributed all the stores that had accumulated; and when Berk-Yaruq besieged Isfahan she emptied the treasury and gave gold without stint to the amirs and the standing army. Berk-Yaruq was frequently in difficulty for money. When Abu'l Mahásin Dihistáni was appointed vizier in 493/1099-1100 there was no money in the treasury, and when Berk-Yaruq reached Baghdad in 494/1101 he had no funds and sent to the caliph for help; after negotiations the caliph sent him 50,000 dinars. The financial situation improved slightly under Muhammad b. Malik-Sháh. Bundári states that he found a balance sheet {tafsil) in the handwriting of his uncle, which stated that Muhammad's treasury contained 18,000,000 dinars apart from gold ornaments, jewels, and garments embroidered with gold and silver thread. The improvement, however, was short lived; at the beginning of the reign of Mahmüd b. Muhammad the treasury he inherited from his father was emptied by his followers. Bundári relates that on one occasion Mahmüd and his officials lacked funds even to provide the daily allowance of beer for themselves. They accordingly sent to the brewer a number of empty boxes from the treasury so that with the proceeds of their sale he might

obtain what he needed. On another occasion Mahmud b. Muhammad is alleged to have asked his treasurer, who had also served his father, for some perfume. The treasurer asked for a few days' delay to procure it. He then brought thirty mithqdls (i mithqdl = 4-3 grammes). Mahmud said to him, " Tell the company how much perfume there used to be in my father's treasury". He answered, "In the fortress of Isfahan there was nearly 180 ritls (1 ritl = 140 mithqdls) in golden, silver, crystal, and china vessels, and we had in the 'field' treasury 30 ritls99.1 Mas'ud b. Mahmud's treasury was also usually empty. Such revenue as arrived from the outlying districts he used to distribute among his audience at once. His vizier Kamal al-Din Muhammad alHusain, attempting to reform abuses in the financial administration, organized the collection and payment of taxes and revived practices which had been neglected. In doing this he exposed the fraudu lent practices of officials and others; he also tried to break the power of the amirs and prevent their corrupt practices. He achieved some measure of success and succeeded in collecting the taxes with greater regularity, but eventually his opposition to the amirs cost him his life. It appears that he had attempted to bribe 'Izz al-Mulk Tahir b. Muhammad Burujirdi, then vizier to Qara-Sonqur, to hand over his master for 500,000 dinars.2 'Izz al-Mulk refused; Kamal al-Din then made Mas'iid frightened of Qara-Sonqur, and together they summoned the amir Boz-Aba from Fars, hoping to use him to overthrow QaraSonqur. The latter, however, reacted strongly; he summoned SaljuqShah b. Muhammad and prepared to set out for Fars to take it from BozAba and give it to Saljuq-Shah. Da'ud and his atabeg Ayaz, who was one of Qara-Sonqur's followers, also joined them. Setting out with the two Saljuq maliks from Azarbaijan with an army of 10,000 men, QaraSonqur reached Hamadan, whence he sent 'Izz al-Mulk Burujirdi to Mas'ud with an ultimatum that Kamal al-Din be killed or handed over to them; Mas'ud was obliged to give way and Kamal al-Din was executed by them in 533/1139. Establishing 'Izz al-Mulk Burujirdi as Mas'ud's vizier, Qara-Sonqur then went to Fars. Having taken posses sion of the province, he handed it over to Saljuq-Shah and returned to Azarbaijan. Boz-Aba, however, recaptured Fars shortly afterwards.

O f the later sultans Sanjar was the only one who had a relatively well-filled treasury, containing rare and valuable objects, including necklaces, pearls, priceless pendants, and other jewels; purses full of money, and garments. His jewels were kept in sealed drums.
The divan over which the vizier presided, the divdn-i a?Id as it was called, had four main departments: (i) the dwan al-inshd' wa?l tughrd^ sometimes called the divdn-i rasaHl or the divdn-i insha9; (2) the diwdn al-^amdm wo*I istifd (also called the divdn-i istifd-yi mamdlik)\ (3) the divdn-i ishrdf-i mamdlik; and (4) the divdn-icard.
The divan-i insha' was primarily concerned with the supervision of incoming and outgoing correspondence, and all diplomas of appoint ment to the various offices of state, including "administrative" iqta's, were prepared in and issued from this office. Its head was called the fugbra9?* According to Bundari, the chief requisite for his office was an ability to execute " c u r v e d " handwriting (al-khatt al-qausi).1 In fact, however, since considerable importance was attached to literary form, the tughra'i was probably often a master of literary style, as indeed was Mu'ayyid al-Daula Muntajab al-Din Badf Atabeg Juvaini, the head of Sanjar's divan-i insha'. Further, since the office was a stepping-stone to the vizierate, and its holder acted as deputy-vizier in the absence of that official, the attainments expected of the tughra'i were clearly more than those of a calligrapher. The divan-i istifa-yi mamalik was concerned with the revenue accounts, tax assessments, collection, and expenditure; its head was the mustaufi al-mamdlik. There exists no detailed information of the exact procedure followed in this department in Saljuq times,2 or of its relations to the divan-i ishraf-i mamalik. It was presumably divided into a number of sub-departments, also called divans: e.g. the divdn-i mtfdmila va qismat appears to have been concerned among other things with tax contracts of the muqata'a type. The empire, so far as it was not alienated from the direct control of the central divan in the form of "administrative" iqta's, was divided into tax districts, each presided over by a mustaufi or 'amil. The tax statement was prepared in the divan-i istifa-yi mamalik and sent to the district mustaufi, who allocated the amount demanded within the district, and was responsible

for the local expenditure of revenue on allowances, pensions, and salaries. Collection was carried out by the local tax-collectors (cummdl) and by their subordinates, the muhassils and mutasarrifs. Oppression in the collection of taxes was not uncommon; and a proportion of the total sum levied must have frequently failed to reach the treasury.1 Tax collection in " administrative " iqta's and provincial governments was in general the responsibility of the muqta' or provincial governor, who had his own divan. In theory the muqta's and provincial governors had no power to alter taxation, but in practice they exercised a wide dis cretion in such matters and were not subject to effective control by the divan-i istifa-yi mamalik. After the reign of Malik-Shah an increasing proportion of the empire was alienated from the direct control of the central divan. When Sanjar reinstated Mahmud b. Muhammad as the ruler of the western provinces of Persia in 513/1119-20, no land remained under his divan because Sanjar had made various assignments to Toghril b. Muhammad and Saljuq-Shah b. Muhammad, and various amirs had taken possession of other districts; the only source of revenue remaining to Mahmud's divan, according to Bundari, was confiscations. The divan-i ishraf-i mamalik was concerned with the auditing of financial transactions. Its head was the mushrif-i mamalik. Nizam alMulk seems to have envisaged the divan-i ishraf as ideally exercising supervision and inspection over the administration in general, and not only its financial matters. In practice, however, the mushrif seems to have been concerned with finances only. There were district or provincial mushrifs in the same way that there were district or provincial mustaufis. The function of the provincial mushrif was:
To account for (zfr-i qalam-i khwish ddrad) everything which went on in the (provincial) divan concerning different kinds of financial transactions (mudmaldt), the conclusion of agreements i^uqud-i qabdldt), adjustment of accounts (taujih), pasture taxes (mard'I), alms taxes (sadaqdt), the allocation of allowances (itldq-i jdmagiyydt va jardydt), particulars of accounts (tafsll-i muhdsibdt\ the conduct of monetary affairs {hall va 'aqd va khtfd va raj'),, and the collection and disbursement of revenue; and to certify {ma'lum ddrad) all the landed estates (amldk) and real property {mustaghalldt) of the sultan, the revenue from khardj and 'ushr {mdl-i khardj va kha^anat va ghalldt-i eushr va irtifd'dt), and salaries {marsumdt), and to take cognizance of whatever sums, great or small, relating to the collection and disbursement of revenue were new, and not omit to record them so that the smallest item of revenue in

INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE SALJUQ EMPIRE
cash or kind should not be levied or expended without his knowledge and authorization. He was to take cognizance of everything that went on in the office of the ra'Js in the way of meetings, the allocation and assessment of tax quotas (qism va taqsitdt), and alterations [in these], and to conceal nothing; to keep himself informed of what went on in the mint and concerning seals {muhr), coins {sikka), and the standards used in every forge. No overseers of
markets (muqaddimdn-i asvdq) or headmen of districts (p>tfamd-yi navdhi) were to be appointed without his knowledge, and he was to appoint vigilant and efficient deputies so that he would know what went on and how those in charge of affairs conducted their business and the state of agriculture and the development [or otherwise] of the district. He was to look into the matter of seed, draught animals, means of cultivation, estimates of the value of crops, and measures, and should consider whether they were too high or too low; he should always have available an amended and up-to-date register and a clear and accurate statement of the extent of the tax districts and their conditions, so that if asked about these he could give an answer. He was to investigate the affairs of the taxpayers and peasants {dahdqin va ra'ayd) so that the tax collectors ('ummdl va mutasarrifdn), scribes, and officials should not make improper demands or impose any extra burden upon them.1
From this document it is clear that the mushrif was concerned with overseeing the collection and disbursement of taxes, and with what ever affected this. Since the prosperity of the empire depended ulti mately on the well-being of agriculture, and since, too, over-taxation would lead to the ruin of the countryside and in the last resort to the flight of the peasantry, he was given a general authority over agri cultural matters. T o what extent and in what way action was taken when a mushrif reported adversely on the action of officials or others in the area under his jurisdiction, is not clear; and there is little reason to suppose that his presence was effective in curtailing corruption and extortion. The divan-i ishraf and the district mushrifs also exercised general supervision over the administration of auqdf> although these were normally under the immediate charge of the qadi; this supervision followed from the fact that the divdn-i auqdf handled the collection and expenditure of funds. The fourth department of the divan-i a'la was the divan-i 'ard, headed by the 'arid al-jaish (also called the sdhib-i divdn-i card), or the muster master. The military registers and records of the "mili tary" iqta's were kept in this department, and everything relating to the pay of the standing army and of the amirs went through it. It was also concerned with recruitment and with assembling and reviewing troops

before military expeditions. Up to the end of the reign of Malik-Shah the 'arid al-jaish was a member of the bureaucracy. Later the office was held from time to time by a Turkish amir. Through the divan-i 'ard the vizier exercised, in theory at least, supervision over the fiscal value of "military" iqta's; but he did not in practice control their allocation. It seems unlikely that the "adminis trative" iqta's went through this department except exceptionally; and unlikely that the vizier, through the 'arid al-jaish, controlled their allocation, though at the height of his power Nizam al-Mulk no doubt exercised considerable influence over these grants. Occasionally other viziers exercised similar control. For example, 'Izz al-Mulk Tahir b. Muhammad al-Bumjirdi, vizier to Mas'ud b. Muhammad, was alleged to have assigned the provinces independently of Mas'ud; and Kamal al-Dln Muhammad b. al-Husain, who made an abortive attempt to reform the financial administration (see p. 256 above), gave iqta's and allowances to the amirs in strict accordance with the numbers of their armies. Nizam al-Mulk recommended that the muqta's and also the tax collectors (^ummdl) should be changed every two or three years so that they would not establish themselves in a strong local position. The divan, however, was seldom strong enough to act upon this advice. Often the heads of the various departments of the divan had deputies, who acted on their behalf in their absence on campaigns or missions for the sultan. Abu'l Qasim Anasabadi Darguzini, whom Sanjar appointed vizier to Toghril b. Muhammad in 526/1132, was at the same time made Sanjar's vizier; he remained in Iraq with Toghril and appointed a deputy to act for him at Sanjar's court. This was an exceptional case. Plurality of office, however, against which Nizam al-Mulk inveighs in the Siydsat-Ndma, was not uncommon. There was also a series of sub ordinate officials and scribes (kuttdb) in the different departments of the divan. The choice of departmental heads of the divan and of subordinate officials was in practice often in the hands of the vizier, whose fall would frequently entail the dismissal of his supporters and clients also. After the death of Nizam al-Mulk the prestige and influence of the vizierate declined, and the sultan tended to deal directly with the heads of the different departments. Berk-Yaruq's mustaufi, Majd al-Mulk Abu'l Fadl Baravistani, dominated the Vizier Fakhr al-Mulk b. Nizam alMulk, and became the most powerful official in the bureaucracy (see below, p. 267). Although the vizier was the head of the bureaucracy and his functions



INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE SALJUQ EMPIRE
mainly administrative, he was nevertheless expected to accompany the sultan on military expeditions. Thus Nizam al-Mulk was present with Alp-Arslan on most of his campaigns; and in 464/1071-2 Alp-Arslan sent him at the head of a large force to Fars, where he defeated Fadluya, the Shabankara leader. When vizier to Muhammad b. Malik-Shah, Khatir al-Mulk Abu Mansur Maibudi was entrusted with the defence of one of the gates of Isfahan during its siege by Berk-Yaruq in 495/ 1102; but he deserted his post and went to Maibud. On some occasions it appears to have been the vizier and not the sultan who dispatched military expeditions. For example, Nizam al-Mulk sent an army to besiege Alamut in 48 5 /1092 after hearing that Hasan-i Sabbah had taken it; and Sanjar's vizier, Mukhtass al-Mulk Abu Nasr Ahmad Kashi, sent an army against the Isma'ilis of Turshiz and Baihaq in 520/1126. The vizier was probably paid mainly by iqta's. Ibn al-Khallikan alleges that one-tenth of the produce of the soil was usually granted as an iqta' to the viziers in the Great Saljuq period.1 If so, this type of iqta' was clearly something rather different from the "administrative" or the "military" iqta'. When Nizam al-Mulk was accused by Abu'l Mahasin b. Kamal al-Daula, deputy-head of the divan-i rasa'il, and by others before Malik-Shah of misappropriating the revenue, he admitted to taking one-tenth of Malik-Shah's wealth, which he alleged to have spent on the standing army, on alms, gifts, and auqaf. This story may be the foundation for Ibn Khallikan's statement. If, in fact, such an allocation was made to the vizier, it was probably not so much in lieu of salary as to enable him to meet the expenses of his office, such as the giving of alms and presents and the provision of allowances for the religious classes and others. It must also be remembered that the area under the direct administration of the central government was probably never the majority of the empire, and therefore the sum involved was not as large as might appear at first sight. Most viziers also held assignments of land, but whether this was granted to them as personal estates or in lieu of salary is not always clear. In either case such assignments differed from the "military" and "administrative" assignments, for the holder was not under obligation to furnish the sultan with troops; and, further, he did not live on his iqta'. Nevertheless, since the maintenance of private armies by in fluential people was the general rule, the produce of these assignments was probably largely spent on the upkeep of troops.

Another source of wealth for the vizier was confiscation and fines. Further, since he was one of the most influential men in the empire, those who desired office, whether at the centre or in the provinces, and those who feared they had incurred the sultan's displeasure endeavoured to buy the vizier's support. 'Amid al-Mulk Kunduri, after his abortive attempt to place Sulaiman b. Chaghri on the throne, and knowing that Nizam al-Mulk's jealousy had been aroused and that he had schemed for his arrest, sought to make his peace with Nizam al-Mulk. In Muharram 456/December 1063-January 1064, Kunduri went to Nizam al-Mulk and left with him 500 dinars tied up in a handkerchief. This availed him nothing and he was killed shortly afterwards. When Malik-Shah seized and blinded Abu'l Mahasin b. Kamal al-Daula in 476/1083-4 after his failure to encompass the fall of Nizam al-Mulk, Kamal al-Daula gave Nizam al-Mulk 200,000 dinars.1 This suggests that there had been a significant increase in the amount of money changing hands in this way. When the Bani Jahir, who had been in the caliph's vizierate, were disgraced in 493/1099-1100, their possessions were sold and the pro ceeds went to Mu'ayyid al-Mulk b. Nizam al-Mulk, Muhammad b. Malik-Shah's vizier. When the latter was killed by Berk-Yaruq, his possessions were taken by Berk-Yaruq's vizier, al-'Izz Abu'l Mahasin Dihistani. When the latter was murdered in 495/1101-2 his wealth was shared between his successor in the vizierate, Khatir al-Mulk Abu Mansur Maibudi, and the sultan. One of the most active viziers in respect to confiscation was Kamal al-Dln Abu'l Barakat Darguzlnl. Shams al-Mulk b. Nizam al-Mulk, who was vizier to Mahmud b. MalikShah in 516/1122-3, is also alleged to have oppressed and fined the people, and consequently to have been hated by them. The vizier was himself obliged to spend large sums of money to retain the favour of the sultan, and, if possible, to forestall the intrigues of rivals. On one occasion Nizam al-Mulk sent a certain Ashtar to accompany Alp-Arslan's envoy on a return mission to Shams al-Mulk, the ruler of Transoxiana, and to report what had transpired. It so happened that Shams al-Mulk's envoy mentioned that Nizam al-Mulk was a rdfidi (i.e. a Shi'i). Ashtar at once informed Nizam al-Mulk. The vizier was much perturbed at this and spent, according to his own account, 30,000 gold dinars to prevent the report—false though it wasreaching the sultan's ears.2
1 Ibn al-Athir, vol. x, p. 85. According to Bundari, Kamal al-Daula gave 300,000 dinars
to the sultan's treasury (p. 57). 2 Siyasat-Ndma, pp. 88-90.

263
The expenses of a vizier's establishment were considerable. His court was the refuge of innumerable persons who sought redress, office, or some other favour. When Nizam al-Mulk came to Baghdad with Malik-Shah in 480/1087-8 many beggars and others came to his court; and none (to quote Hindu-Shah, author of the Tajdrib al-salaf) went away disappointed. When he left Baghdad he ordered the gifts he had made to be counted: they amounted to 140,000 dinars. The second time he came to Baghdad he did not at first give any presents, but after a member of the religious classes remonstrated with him, he resumed his former practice. Taj al-Mulk Abu'l Ghana'im—Terken Khatun's vizier, who, with Majd al-Mulk Baravistani, the mustaufi, and with Abu'l Ma'ali Sadid al-Mulk, the 'arid al-jaish, plotted for the downfall of Nizam al-Mulk—accused him of spending 300,000 dinars annually on thefuqahd(jurists) and Sufis. According to al-Tuturshi, Nizam al-Mulk spent double that sum annually on madrasas, ribdts (hospices), and pensions for the pious and the poor. Indeed the vizier, like the sultan, was expected to keep an open table and to show generosity to the poor and the religious classes, and since these obligations arose in part from his official position, it is not unlikely that the money spent on pensions and madrasas was derived, partly at least, from the state revenue. The vizier in some cases had his own "private" army; and that of Nizam al-Mulk was of considerable size. His mamluks were known as the ^izamiyya mamluks, and after his death they played an important part in securing the accession of Berk-Yaruq; then, in revenge for the death of their former master, they killed Taj al-Mulk Abu'l Ghana'im, who had been designated to succeed him as vizier to Malik-Shah but had not formally assumed office before Malik-Shah died. It was usual for the vizier to rise to his office through the subordinate ranks of the divan. Many held the office of mustaufi, 'arid al-jaish, or tughra'i before becoming vizier. Some entered the divan-i a'la after being employed in the provinces or in the divan of an amir or a Saljuq princess. Transfer from the divan of one Saljuq malik to another was also not uncommon. Thus viziers and departmental heads of the divan enjoyed a common background and training. There was, however, occasionally recruitment to the bureaucracy from other classes; and an able man, if he was prepared to accept patronage and adopt the various devices which led to success in official life, could rise to the top. Abu'l Qasim Anasabadi Darguzini was the son of a peasant of Anasabad near Hamadan. He came to Isfahan as a child and subsequently entered the

services of Kamal al-Mulk Simirumi, acting as vizier to Guhar Khatun, Muhammad b. Malik-Shah's wife. He then became vizier to the amir hajib, 'AH b. 'Umar, at which time he laid the foundations of his fortune (see p. 251 above). He ultimately became vizier to Sanjar and Toghril b. Muhammad, and was executed by the latter in 527/1133. Kamal al-Mulk Simirumi himself was the son of a man who farmed Simirum, which belonged to Guhar Khatun's divan. He entered the service of Guhar Khatun's divan and in due course her vizier, when he went to Baghdad, made Kamal al-Mulk his deputy. Kamal al-Mulk rehabili tated Guhar Khatun's divan and succeeded in ingratiating himself with her; and on the death of the vizier he became the head of her divan. She recommended him to the sultan, who made him mushrif al-mamalik, and then mustaufi. Finally he became vizier to Mahmud b. Muhammad in 512/1118-19. Muhammad b. Sulaiman Kashghari, who became Sanjar's vizier, was previously a merchant. He was not a popular or successful vizier. Trade, it seems, was not a suitable training for the bureaucracy. Zaki, whose incompetence, as stated above, had contri buted to the replacement of the vakil-i dar by the amir hajib, was a rich Qazvini merchant. The most famous of all the Saljuq viziers was Nizam al-Mulk. Five of his sons, two of his grandsons, and one great-grandson held the office of vizier to one or other of the sultans or maliks after him, though none of them achieved his eminence. He was the son of a man who had been made the tax-collector and revenue farmer (bunddr) of Tus, by the Ghaznavid 'amid of Khurasan. A t the beginning of the Saljuq expansion the country was in a state of disorder and the taxes were not being collected. The 'amid of Khurasan demanded from Abu'l Hasan, Nizam al-Mulk's. father, the arrears of Tus, which he was unable to pay in full. In the prevailing confusion the administration began to disintegrate and many of the Ghaznavid officials dispersed. Abu'l Hasan eventually found his way to Ghazna, with his son Nizam al-Mulk, who was still a child. In due course the latter entered Ghaznavid service, but after Balkh fell to the Saljuqs in 43 2/1040-1 he attached himself to the 'amid of Balkh, Ibn Shadan. His experiences with Ibn Shadan were not altogether happy. It is related—perhaps apocryphally—that whenever the 'amid thought Nizam al-Mulk had accumulated any wealth, he would say, " O Hasan, you have grown fat" and mulct him. When this had happened several times Nizam al-Mulk fled to Marv.1 There, by

some means or other, he joined the service of Alp-Arslan. Kunduri, who had been Toghril Beg's vizier, was dismissed by Alp-Arslan shortly after his accession, and Nizam al-Mulk became vizier, which office he also held under Malik-Shah. Ghazali, who was Nizam alMulk's contemporary, compared him to the Barmakids; and he appears to have enjoyed a great reputation among all classes of the population, including the army. Such was his prestige that the caliph allowed him to be seated in his presence. On the occasion of the betrothal of MalikShah's daughter to the caliph in 474/1081-2, when the sultan's retinue went to the caliph's court, Nizam al-Mulk, at the caliph's command, rode while everyone else walked; and when they reached the caliph's audience Nizam al-Mulk was seated on a throne (masnad) and given a robe of honour with a border (fard^) on it, inscribed: " In the name of the just and perfect vizier, Nizam al-Mulk, radi amiriHmu'minin."1 T o what extent Nizam al-Mulk's reputation for justice was merited is difficult to judge. His lavish expenditure on pensions, allowances to the religious classes, and the building of madrasas contributed to his fame and popularity. In a letter to Fakhr al-Mulk b. Nizam al-Mulk, Ghazali tells him of his father's ambition not to be surpassed by anyone in good works.2 He appears on the whole to have counselled moderation and tolerance, though in his early career, at least, he was not above ridding himself of rivals by intrigue, as he did in the case of 'Amid al-Mulk Kunduri. He was undoubtedly an able and competent administrator, and not without skill in military affairs—a fact which no doubt was of great help to him in his relations with the amirs, and which enabled him to maintain the prestige of the bureaucracy vis-a-vis the military. He appears to have been a good judge of character, an essential attribute of a vizier when power was personal rather than institutional. Bundari states that he selected each man for the work for which he was best suited and appointed him to office accordingly. The fact that many of his relatives held office under him increased his power though it also aroused the sultan's jealousy.
The office of vizier was potentially, and under Nizam al-Mulk actually, one of great power, but it also involved its holder in great risks. He had no security of tenure and could be dismissed at will and without cause by the sultan. The power he exercised was delegated to him entirely as a matter of grace: he was the servant, not of the state, but of the sultan, and consequently it was essential for him to retain the

satisfaction of the sultan, who, because of the arbitrary nature of power in the medieval Persian state, was inevitably jealous of any influence the vizier obtained. The latter often faced a conflict between his duty towards the people, whether seen in terms of Islam or common justice, and political practice. Ghazali indeed took the view that the vizier because of his office inevitably became involved in corruption and disobedience to the laws of God.1 Another story, also perhaps apo cryphal, illustrates this point. Nizam al-Mulk complained to the Imam al-Haramain of Alp-Arslan's secret ill-feeling towards him in spite of his almost superhuman efforts in the interests of the state. The Imam alHaramain replied that since the wealth and property of the sultan were in the hands of Nizam al-Mulk, inevitably the sultan suspected him of corruption. He also pointed out that some of the demands sultans made upon their viziers were impossible to fulfil. The vizier was also likely to incur the dissatisfaction of other members of the sultan's family, who, if their desires were opposed or they were prevented from interfering in affairs, were likely to attribute this to the vizier's opposition; and the vizier's rivals, desirous of selfadvancement, would encourage them in this. N o vizier who made any serious effort to establish an effective administration was immune from the jealousy and intrigues of his fellows. Nizam al-Mulk, the strongest and most influential of all the Saljuq viziers, was no exception, and many of his contemporaries attributed his murder—generally thought to have been committed by an emissary of Hasan-i Sabbah—to Malik-Shah and Taj al-Mulk Abu'l Ghana'im, Terken Khatun's vizier, who had sup ported her in her efforts to persuade the sultan to declare her son Mahmud as vali cahd. The bureaucracy had no traditions of integrity and independence: the vizier could not expect loyalty from his colleagues, and con sequently self-preservation demanded that he should fill key places as far as possible with his relatives and clients, the former because he could in some measure control them and the latter because their hope of advancement would be at least temporarily bound up with his. But by the nature of the case he fought a losing battle. He had to share with his supporters the benefits and spoils of office; and as they rose from poverty to riches, from weakness to power, and insignificance to fame, they were likely to scheme with others to encompass his destruction. The prevention of corruption in subordinate officials was an ex

tremely difficult problem for the vizier, and one which, however dealt with, made many enemies for him. There was no adequate system of control or supervision. The band, which in earlier times had been used for the transmission of messages between government agents in the provinces and the capital, and whose officers kept watch over and reported on events taking place in various parts of the empire, had been abolished. Alp-Arslan's alleged reasons for objecting to it were sound: namely, that those who were loyal would pay no attention to the sahib khabar (the postmaster) and see no need to bribe him, while his enemies would make friends with the sahib khabar and give him money, with the result that he would report favourably on them and un favourably on those who were loyal.1 But in the absence of any effective checks and controls in the administrative system, there could be, as Nizam al-Mulk recognized, no security for the ruler against rebellion, injustice, or extortion by his officials. Hence Nizam al-Mulk advocated an efficient system of espionage backed by an armed force strong enough to overpower all opposition. In his view, the sultan should have in formers and spies throughout the empire and among all classes of the people, including the qadis. He probably had his own agents in the country, but in spite of his advice, the barid was not re-established. Perhaps the most delicate problem of all for the vizier was his relationship with the amirs. His official business constantly brought him into contact with them. Friendship with them individually attracted the enmity of those excluded from the friendship and aroused the suspicion of the sultan. Up to the death of Nizam al-Mulk the vizier's influence was greater than that of the amirs, but after his death they gradually deprived the bureaucracy of all effective power. None after Nizam al-Mulk really succeeded in reimposing control over the amirs, and those who tried came to an untimely end. The first and most striking case is that of the mustaufi Majd al-Mulk Baravistani, who, having succeeded in getting Fakhr al-Mulk b. Nizam al-Mulk appointed to Berk-Yaruq's vizierate in 488/1095, made his own influence domi nant in the divan. He appears to have attempted to keep a tight hold on the amirs, but in 492/1098-9 Oner rebelled and offered Berk-Yaruq his renewed obedience on condition that Majd al-Mulk was surrendered to him. But before any action could occur, Oner was assassinated. The opposition to Majd al-Mulk was not thereby ended, and later in the same year a number of prominent amirs demanded that the sultan

268
should hand Majd al-Mulk over to them. Berk-Yaruq refused to surrender him. The rebellious amirs thereupon entered the sultan's tent, dragged out the mustaufi, and killed him.1 This incident is signifi cant of the changing relationships between the vizierate ana the amirs; and by the time of Mas'ud b. Muhammad, the amirs began to appoint their own nominees to the office. A s stated above, Qara-Sonqur made his own vizier, 'Izz al-Mulk Tahir b. Muhammad Bumjirdi, the vizier to Mas'ud b. Muhammad in 533/1139. After the death of Qara-Sonqur, a group of amirs led by 'Abd al-Rahman b. Tughrayarak persuaded Mas'ud to seize 'Izz al-Mulk in 5 39/1144-5 and in the following year (or in 541/1146-7) Boz-Aba, who had become one of the most powerful amirs in the empire, succeeded in appointing his own vizier, Taj alDin Abu'l Fath b. Darast, to the sultan's vizierate. He held office for only a few months, however, before returning to Boz-Aba's service in Fars. Ibn al-Athir states that he preferred Boz-Aba's service to the sultan's, whereas Bundari states that Mas'ud allowed him to return to Boz-Aba in the hope that he would restrain Boz-Aba from rebellion. Whichever account is nearer to the truth, it is clear that there had been a sharp decline in the power of the sultan's vizierate, as well as a major change in the relations between vizier and amirs. The position of the vizier and of government officials in general was extremely insecure. After the death of Nizam al-Mulk, viziers suc ceeded one another with great rapidity. This was perhaps partly due to the prevailing financial stringency; the dismissal of a vizier and the confiscation of his wealth by the sultan was a means of temporarily relieving this stringency. After the death of Malik-Shah the number of viziers who escaped being murdered, imprisoned, or having their wealth confiscated is small. The readiness with which the later sultans listened to intrigues against their viziers contrasts strongly with the conduct of Alp-Arslan, who, on one occasion when he received a letter accusing Nizam al-Mulk of malpractices, is alleged to have given it to him and said, " If they are right in what they have written, repair your nature and mend your ways; and if they lied then forgive them their slip".2 But it is also true that since there were no effective controls or checks against corruption within the bureaucratic system itself, then
1 Ravandi, pp. 145-7. I ° N al-Athir's account differs slightly, in that he states that Berk
Yaruq finally agreed to surrender Majd al-Mulk but made the amirs promise to spare his
life. When he was handed over by the sultan, some soldiers killed him before he reached the
amirs (vol. x, pp. 196-7).

once there was a relaxation in the power of the sultan, intrigue and corruption grew and fed upon each other. The sultan exercised "administrative" justice in the mazalim court, personally or through his agents. He delegated his function as judge according to the ideal system of the shari'a to the qadi. In the mazalim court the administration of justice was exercised on the basis of custom, equity, and governmental regulations; whereas the qadi in his court applied the shari'a according to certain formal rules of evidence and procedure.1 This court sat in the mosque, in the qadi's residence, or some other duly appointed place. It was concerned primarily with the settlement of litigation, the execution of testaments and matters of inheritance, escheat, transfers of property, administration of the affairs of orphans, widows, and of those legally incapacitated, and the appoint ment of umand (trustees) for this purpose. The qadi normally applied the sharfa according to the rite to which most people in the area under his jurisdiction belonged. Among the qualifications demanded of the qadi was that he should be a Muslim, free, and versed in the principles of the law (usul al-fiqh).
In spite of the fact that by Saljuq times the jurisdiction of the mazalim court tended to overlap with and to supersede that of the qadi's court, the qadi still played an extremely important role in the life of the Saljuq empire. He acted as a link both between the political and the religious institution, and between the sultan and his people; and he maintained and transmitted the traditions of Islamic civilization. From the new relationship between the caliph and the sultan, and from the renewed association of the political and the religious institution, there followed a reappraisal of the position of the religious classes in general and of the qadi in particular. Nizam al-Mulk states the qadis were the deputies (nd'ibdn) of the ruler, upon whom their support was incumbent. Full respect and dignity were to be accorded to them because they were the deputies of the caliph (nd'ibdn-i khalifa), upon whom his mantle (shi'dr) had devolved. A t the same time, they were also appointed by the secular ruler and did his work.2 Similarly in contemporary documents the 'ulama are sometimes referred to as the "heirs of the Prophet" and the qadis as the officers of the shari'a and "the umand of G o d in the execution of decrees, the termination of disputes, and in obtaining the rights of the weak".3 The position of the

qadis vis-a-vis the sultan was to some extent analogous with that of the caliph vis-a-vis the sultan: the immediate source of their power was the sultan, who exercised constituent authority, but their functional authority was derived from the shari'a and the Prophet—hence the reference to them as the "heirs of the Prophet". But whereas the caliph under the new arrangement exercised only spiritual authority, the qadis were incorporated into the political institution. Once a qadi was appointed, it was theoretically incumbent upon government officials to execute his decrees, which were not subject to review, though in cases of injustice an appeal could in theory be made to the mazalim court. The freedom of action of the qadi was limited in practice, first because he had to rely on the officials of the dargah (or, in the provinces, on the muqta') to execute his decrees; and secondly because he was subject to dismissal by the sultan, or by those to whom the sultan had delegated authority in the provinces. With their incorporation into the administrative hierarchy, the qadi and other officials of the religious institution, such as the khatib and muhtasib, received salaries and allowances as other officials did. Nizam al-Mulk, writing on the position of the qadis states:
He (the sultan) must know the condition of each one of the qadis of the kingdom individually. Whoever of them is more learned, more abstemious, more honest (kutdh-dasttar), he shall keep in office, but whoever is not he shall be dismissed and replaced by someone more worthy. He shall allocate to each one of them a salary (mushdhird) sufficient for his livelihood so that he will have no need to commit embezzlement. This is an important and delicate affair because the qadis are empowered over the lives and possessions of the Muslims. If they issue a decree in ignorance, greed, or with deliberate intent, or give a written judgement, it will be incumbent upon other judges (hdkimdn) to execute that evil decree while making it known to the sultan so that he may dismiss and punish that person. The officials must support the qadi and preserve his prestige. If anyone behaves proudly and does not appear at the [qadi's] summons, he shall be made to appear by force and compulsion even though he is a man of standing {muhtasham).1
The documents of the day also recognize that the office of qadi was intimately connected with the well-being and interests of the population. He was in fact often their spokesman, and in times of disorder it was not unknown for him to organize the administration and defence of a city. Usually, moreover, he was a local man, and there was a strong hereditary tendency in the office. The chief qadi of a town or

district, who was called the qadi al-quddt, was appointed by the sultan, unless he lived in an area alienated from the ruler's direct control, in which case he was probably appointed by the provincial governor or the muqtac. He usually had power to appoint deputies in the area under him. In his deed of appointment he was designated as the qadi of such and such a place. This was also the case with diplomas issued for mustauf is, mushrifs, 'amils, and other officials, who were appointed over specified areas; but whereas they were simply the representatives of the divan-i a
cla in the area, the qadis, although appointed by the sultan, exercised their authority both as the "heirs of the Prophet", and as the qadis of a particular area, which gave them a certain independence vis-d-vis the central government. The main duty of the qadi under the Saljuqs was probably to watch over the religious institution on behalf of the sultan, especially with a view to preventing unorthodox opinions. Usually, though not in variably, the qadi was also entrusted with the supervision of mosques and of the officials of the religious institution, notably the muhtasib, in the area to which he was appointed. His oversight of the mosques sometimes included power to nominate the imams, who led the prayers, and the khatib, who read the khutba in the Friday mosque. In the chief cities of the empire, however, the latter was frequently nominated by the sultan; and in Marv the office was held by a Shafi'i.1 It was not un common for the office of khatib to be held by a qadi. With regard to the administration and supervision of auqaf there was considerable variety of practice. If no mutavalli (administrator) had been appointed by the founder, the qadi administered the vaqf directly; if, however, there was a mutavalli, then the qadi merely exercised general supervision over its administration. The qadi frequently taught in the local madrasa, and in some cases held the office of mudarris. Often, too, he was a mufti and issued fatwds (decrees) on theological and juridical matters. Sometimes he also presided over the mazalim court, as stated above. Lastly the qadis were often used by the sultanas envoys. This was perhaps partly because of the respect in which they were held by the local population; and partly because it was the policy of the Saljuqs to incorporate the religious hierarchy into the administrative hierarchy. Alp-Arslan appears to have had a chief qadi of the empire: qddi-yi jumla-yi mamdlik. According to the document for his appointment, dated Muharram 457/December 1064-January 1065, this official was

entrusted with the care of mosques and auqâf, and was instructed to hear shar'i cases and to take good care of the documents (wills, contracts, etc.) deposited with him. The great men of the kingdom, the tax collectors, rtfasâ, and all the subjects were enjoined to consider him the foremost qâdï of the empire (aqdâyl-qudât dar kull-i vildydt).1 With the increased centralization of the administration in the hands of the vizier during the reign of Malik-Shâh, it is not unlikely that the office of chief qâdï of the empire fell into disuse. The vizier as head of the financial administration exercised general supervision over auqâf, as stated above; but his precise relationship to the chief qâdï, and to the provincial qâdïs—in respect to the supervision of auqâf, as well as to the extent and nature of control held by the dlvdn-i auqdf-i mamdlik over provincial auqâf—is not clear. In some cases the auqâf of a particular district were expressly placed outside the control of this divan.2 It is possible that under Sanjar the qddï-ji lashkar may have, to some extent, taken the place of the chief qâdï of the empire. In a diploma for the qâdi-yi lashkar issued by Sanjar's divan for the qâdï al-quddt, Majd al-Din, he was entrusted with the supervision of auqâf; and the amirs, army leaders, and the sultan's entourage, Turk and non-Turk, were all instructed to refer their shar'i cases to him. He was also enjoined to administer the Hanafi rite.3 While the renewed association between the religious and the political institution did in some ways strengthen the position of the qâdïs, it also to some extent jeopardized their independence. Nizâm al-Mulk, in fact, proposed that the sultan should appoint a god-fearing man in every town to watch over and give information about the condition of the 'âmil, the qâdï, the muhtasib, and the subjects in general.4 The muhtasib, who was under the general supervision of the qâdï was, like him, normally a member of the religious classes ; and through him the sultan came into contact with his subjects in yet another way: by exercising control over the moral welfare of the townspeople. In general the people in the towns were grouped according to their religious, ethnical, and above all professional affinities, because only by grouping themselves into corporations were they able to protect their lives and goods, and to buy intercessions and favours to relieve their lot. The corporate organization of society, which was a marked feature of Islamic society in Persia until modern times, was characteristic also of

the Saljuq period. There is evidence of a spirit of corporate feeling among the inhabitants of various cities, which sometimes manifested itself in rivalry between different towns and also in the ability of a town to make a settlement with individual leaders without reference to the central government or its officials. Thus when disorders were com mitted by the 'ayydr in Baihaq after the death of Malik-Shah in 48 5/1092, a sayyid from a neighbouring village patrolled the city at night with mounted men and footmen so that "no disorderly person or wrong doer should encroach upon the possessions of the Muslims or their women".1 Bodies of 'ayyar were to be found in various cities, notably Baghdad and Nishapur. These groups may have originated as an offshoot of the futuwwa organizations. In the Qdbus-Ndma, where he discusses the fifth/eleventh-century Persian conception of javdnmardi or futuwwa
(chivalry), Kai Ka'us ranks soldiers (sipdbiydri), 'ayydrdn, and the people of the bazaar as the fourth and last group of those possessing this quality. The other three were first Sufis, secondly wise men, prophets, and saints, and lastly "spiritual" men and apostles.2 From his de scription it seems possible that the futuwwa organizations were dividing along two lines, those who fulfilled their self-imposed duties in an active sphere, and those who interpreted jihad as applying to the inward and spiritual struggle against the temptations of the world. Kai Ka'us states: "The most perfect soldier is like the most perfect 'ayydr, but generosity, hospitality, liberality, gratitude, and probity should be greater in a soldier, and he should be more heavily armed; and while [to prefer] his own loss and the benefit of a friend, obedience, and humility are a virtue in a soldier, they are a fault in an (ayydr."3 Ibn al-Jauzi (d. 5 97/1200-1), writing rather later, also identifies the 'ayyar with those who belong to the futuwwa organization. He states:
Amongst those persons who have been made captive by the misrepresenta tions of Satan are the 'ayydr; and this body, who are calledfitydn,take the people's goods, and say "a fata, is one who does not commit fornication nor lie, and strives to preserve the honour and reputation of women, and does not violate their privacy. In spite of this, they do not restrain themselves from seizing people's property, not remembering that by their action they oppress the people. They call their organisation (tarlqa) 'futuwwa'" It often happens that one of them takes an oath, binding himself to the obligations

of futuwwa, and abstains from food and drink. Their garments are trousers (sardwll) with which they invest everyone who enters their organisation, in the same way as the Sufis clothe the murid in a patched garment (muraqqa'd).1
The general tendency was for the 'ayyar to degenerate into bands of robbers. Already before Saljuq times they had been a frequent source of trouble to the Samanid administration in Khurasan; and Ya'qub b. Laith, the founder of the Saffarid dynasty, was himself an 'ayyar. By Saljuq times the 'ayyar were mostly undisciplined mobs who took up arms, robbed and murdered the population, and spread terror among them when opportunity offered.2 The city was usually enclosed by a fortified wall, within which there was frequently a citadel: the last refuge of the city's defenders in case of siege, and of government officials in case of revolt. The city was divided into quarters, and in the large cities each quarter was selfcontained and sometimes enclosed within its own walls, having its own mosque, bazaar for primary necessities, and public bath. Nasir-i Khusrau mentions that all the streets and quarters of Isfahan had strong bars and gates in 444/105 2.3 Sometimes the quarters were separated from one another by an occupational grouping. Factional and sectarian strife and rivalry among different quarters were not uncommon, especially in Baghdad. Nishapur was also notorious for factional strife. In 489/1096 riots took place there between the Karamiyya and other sections of the people; many were killed, and the Shafi'is and Hanafis prevailed in the end;4 and after the Ghuzz captured Sanjar in 548/1153, it is alleged that there were riots in Nishapur every night in one quarter or another, because of religious differences and ancient hatreds.5 Tus appears to have been another town where lack of unity prevailed. Ghazali, too, complains of intrigues and envy among its inhabitants.6 The dhimmis or members of the "protected" communities, i.e. Christians, Jews, Sabeans, and Zoroastrians (only the first two were found in any number), were segregated in their own quarters. They each had their own organizations and took little part in the life of the Muslim community. They enjoyed freedom of religion and appointed

their own religious officials, subject probably to the confirmation of the sultan or his officials. They were subject to the payment of jivga (polltax) and to certain other limitations such as the wearing of distinguish ing marks on their clothing; and they were debarred from bearing arms. The Jews were probably largely occupied in trade and com merce. There were Jewish and Christian communities in many of the large cities of the empire, notably Baghdad and Nishapur. Benjamin of Tudela, who travelled some years after the death of Sanjar, mentions Jewish communities in, among other places, Hamadan, Isfahan, Nihavand, and Shiraz. On the whole there appears to have been little discrimination against the dhimmis, though from time to time there were outbreaks of feeling against them. Ibn al-Athir relates an incident concerning a Jew called Abu Sa'd b. Samha, who lived in Baghdad in 484/1091 and was an agent {vakil) for Malik-Shah and Nizam al-Mulk. After being struck by a huckster in the street, he went with the shahna, Gauhar A'in, to the sultan's camp, which was then in the neighbourhood, to complain of the caliph's vizier, Abu Shuja*—presumably because he was considered responsible for public order so far as it concerned the dhimmis in Baghdad. Meanwhile, a decree was issued by the caliph forcing the dhimmis to wear distinguishing marks on their clothing, and they began to flee from Baghdad. But when A b u Sa'd and Gauhar A ' i n reached the sultan's camp their demand for Abu Shuja°s dismissal from the caliph's vizierate was accepted, and the caliph was forced to comply.1 It is clear from the fact that new orders for the dhimmis to wear special clothing were from time to time issued that these orders were not permanently enforced. A new order making it obligatory on the dhimmis in Baghdad to wear distinguishing marks on their clothes was issued by Mahmud b. Muhammad in 515/1121-2. The most influential and respected section of the local population was that composed of the religious classes, many of whom had a large following among the people. It was perhaps for this reason that they were frequently employed as envoys. Al-Muqtadi sent A b u Ishaq Shirazi on an embassy to Malik-Shah in 475/1083. In every town through which he passed the people came out with their women and children to welcome him, and sought to touch his stirrups and collect the dust from his mule as a blessing; and in Saveh various guilds, such as the bakers', fruiterers', confectioners', and others came out to present

offerings of their respective trades and crafts. A vd'i^ (preacher) named 'Abbadi, whom Sanjar sent to the caliph in 541/1166-7, found great acceptance in Baghdad. Mas'ud b. Muhammad and others came to hear him preach, and "as for the common people, they abandoned their occupations to be present at his assembly".1 The religious classes were organized into corporations; in the large towns the Shafi'is and Hanafis (and any other rites that existed) each had their own ra'ts or head, who sometimes received a diploma of appointment from the sultan. A b u Sa'd cAbd al-Karlm b. Muhammad b. Mansur al-Sam'ani, who received a diploma from Sanjar's divan for the office of ra'is of the Shafi'is of Marv and its environs, was also appointed khatib of the Friday mosque and mutavalli of its auqaf, and he was authorized to teach in the madrasas, including the Nizamiyya madrasa, shrines (mashdhid-i khair\ and Friday mosque. The khatibs of the neighbourhood and the mutavallis of the auqaf were instructed to refer their affairs to him.2 The 'Alids also formed an important cor poration under their own naqib> who in some cases received a diploma of appointment from the sultan; and they were in some measure removed from the authority of other officials. In a diploma issued by Sanjar's divan for Murtada Jamal al-Din Abu'l Hasan 'Alavi, for the office of naqib of the sayyids of Gurgan, Dihistan, Astarabad, and the neighbourhood, which office he held by hereditary right, he was enjoined to treat the sayyids with respect according to the degree of their learning (film) and piety (fafdf), and to transmit to them their livelihood from the customary sources. He was to strengthen the righteous and punish the wicked, to investigate carefully their genealogies, and to expel anyone who falsely claimed to be a sayyid. All the sayyids of Gurgan and Dihistan were to recognize him as their naqib, to obey him, and refer their affairs to him. The divan officials and local officials were to respect him and to entrust to him the affairs of the sayyids without interfering therein.3
It was not only the 'ulama of the religious institution who were held in respect. The Sufis also enjoyed honour among all classes of the people and were organized in recognized orders and corporations. Some, like Abu Sa'id b. Abi'l Khair, who was visited on several occasions by various members of the Saljuq family, passed lives of religious devotion; others used the garb of a Sufi to make a livelihood. Among such were

the guilds of story-tellers against whom Ibn al-Jauzi warned in The Devil's Delusion:
In our time the story-tellers act in a way which has no connection with delusion, since it is an evident way of making the stories a source of liveli hood and of getting gifts from tyrannical princes and obtaining the like from the gatherers of unlawful imposts and earning money by [their stories] in the provinces. Some of them go to the cemeteries where they dilate upon affection and parting with friends drawing tears from the women, but not exhorting them to take warning.1
The more prominent merchants ranked among the "notables" of the city, while the smaller merchants ranked with the craft guilds in the bazaars. The merchant community with the sarrafs (brokers) played an important part in financing the operations of the state. Travelling, exporting, and wholesale merchants usually conducted their business in caravanserais, which were situated on the outskirts of the town or in the bazaar itself. According to Nasir-i Khusrau, there were fifty good caravanserais in Isfahan in his day where the merchants congregated and had rooms.2 Monetary dealings were handled largely through the sarrafs. Nasir-i Khusrau reports that there were 200 sarrafs in one of the bazaars of Isfahan in 444/1052, which indicates the commercial importance of Isfahan at that time. The bazaar was usually divided into a number of suqs, belonging to the different craft guilds, most of which had their own separate quarters. However, the craftsmen did not live in the bazaars; these were locked and barred at night, as were the premises of the craftsmen within them. Some guilds, such as the brickmakers' and plasterers', were usually to be found on the outskirts of the city. Trade was carried on daily except on Fridays and religious holidays. Ghazali has a curious passage in the Kimiyd al-sacddaz on forbidden things (munkirdt) in a bazaar, which gives a glimpse of the life of the people. Among the items which should not be sold he mentions effigies of animals for children at the holiday if id), swords and wooden shields for the Nau-Ruz (the festival of the vernal equinox), and clay pipes for Sada (the festival of the autumnal equinox). These things were not in themselves forbidden but they were a mani festation of Zoroastrian customs, which were contrary to the sharfa and for this reason unseemly. Further, excessive decoration of the bazaars, making much confectionery and extravagance on the occasion of the Nau-Ruz were not fitting: Nau-Ruz and Sada should be forgotten.

The guilds had their own leaders. They were probably responsible, not only for the maintenance of professional standards, but also for allocating among the members and then collecting the taxes and levies that were assessed on the guild in a lump sum. The sources tell us little of the actual membership of the guilds and their methods of work. Ghazali mentions three types of association which were customary but in his view wrong. The first was the association of porters (hammdldn) and artisans (pishavardn), who made the pooling of their individual earnings a condition of their association. The other two did not specifically concern the guilds but were, rather, trading associations. The first consisted of persons who pooled their capital and shared the subsequent loss or gain; and the second was a partnership between two parties, one of whom had standing, while the other put up the money and traded in his partner's name, the profits being shared between them.1 As in later times, the bazaar was sometimes closed by way of protest against injustice. Thus in 512/1118-19, w n e n o n e ° f the soldiers of Mengii-Bars, the shahna of Baghdad, broke into the house of a newly married couple, wounded the bridegroom, and raped his wife, the bazaars all closed in protest. Public morals and the due performance by Muslims of their religious duties were under the general care of the muhtasib. He had to prevent, for example, prayer that was contrary to the legal rites, the breaking of the fast of Ramadan, wine-drinking in public, the playing of illegal musical instruments, and unseemly behaviour in public. He was also charged with overseeing what might be called public amenities. Thus it was his duty to see that no house was raised above another belonging to a Muslim so as to overlook the women's quarters; that no house had projecting rain-spouts or open drainpipes to drench or befoul wayfarers in the street; and that free passage in the streets was not impeded. He was not to allow slaves to be ill-treated, or animals overburdened. He was also to see that the dhimmis complied with the regulations imposed upon them to distinguish them from Muslims. The muhtasib's main task, however, was to oversee the markets and to prevent dishonest dealing by merchants and artisans, as well as to supervise the guilds and corpora tions. He was empowered to inflict summary punishment on offenders.2 Nizam al-Mulk states that a muhtasib should be appointed in every city

Islam (Cambridge, 1957), pp. 334 ff.

to oversee weights and prices, to watch over commercial transactions, prevent fraud and the adulteration of goods, and "to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil". If the sultan and his officials did not support the muhtasib, " the poor would be in trouble and the people of the bazaar would buy and sell as they liked, middle-men (fadla-kbur) would become dominant, corruption would become open and the shari'a without prestige".1 In a diploma issued from Sanjar's divan for the muhtasib of Mazandaran, Auhad al-Din, he is commanded to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil; to exert himself in the equalization and control of weights and measures (tasviyat va ta'dil-i mavd^in va makd'zl) so that no fraud would be committed in buying and selling and the Muslims would not be cheated or suffer loss; to ensure that the requirements of the shari'a would be duly carried out in mosques and places of worship, and that the tmf adhdhins and other officials would perform their duties in the proper way and at the stated times; to strive to suppress corrupt persons and to prevent notorious conduct by them in public, the open commission of vice, and any dealing in intoxicating drink in the neighbourhood of mosques, burial places, and tombs. Further, the muhtasib must see that the dhimmis wear distinguishing clothing to mark their inferiority among the Muslims; and he must prevent women mixing in assemblies of the Udamd {majlis-i Him) and listening to homilies (mavd(i%).2
Saljuq documents not infrequently compare the sultan to a shepherd and state that the subjects were placed in his care as a trust from God. In some measure his function as "the shepherd of his people" was delegated to the qadi. In part, however, it was delegated to a local official known as the ra'is. This term, like various others, is used in a variety of senses and not always with precision. In some instances, as stated above, it is broadly synonymous with a provincial governor; it is also used to designate the head of a religious corporation. But in its most common use the term ra'is designated a local official representing the local people vis-a-vis the government in general and the tax adminis tration in particular. In the larger towns he was appointed by the sultan or the muqta'. But he was not an official of the central or the provincial government, as were the 'amil, mustaufi, and mushrif, even though they, too, were sometimes local men; normally he was one of the leaders of local society, for only a man of local influence and standing could carry out his duties. Not only did he stand up for the interests of

INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE SALJUQ EMPIRE
280
the local population against the officials of the bureaucracy and the military classes—those living in the area and passing through it—but he also ensured that the local population paid their taxes in full to the government. There are instances of a ra'is being sent from one city to another, though this was probably exceptional. Ibn Funduq states that Hamza b. Muhammad, in whose family the office of ra'is of Baihaq was hereditary, became ra'is of Baihaq for a time, and then was sent as ra'is to Tabriz and Maragheh.1 As with the qadi, there was probably a hereditary tendency in this office. Ravandi relates an incident that shows the importance of the ra'is as the representative of the local people: when the Nizamiyya mamluks took Berk-Yaruq from Isfahan to Ray and seated him on the throne, the ra'is of Ray, Abu Muslim, the son-in-law of Nizam al-Mulk, suspended a jewelled crown above his head.2 In some instances the ra'is of a town was a man of considerable substance, as was A b u Hashim, the ra'is of Hamadan (see above, p. 251). Since the relations between the government and people were princi pally in the field of taxation, it follows that the functions of the ra'is were mainly connected with financial affairs. It was his special duty to safeguard the well-being of the people and to see that their burdens were lightened, and at the same time to ensure the due collection of divan taxes, to prevent both tyranny and oppression by the tax-collectors and evasion by the tax-payers. Through him the sultan exercised control over the officials of the divan. It was his duty to prevent anything being levied without due authorization from the divan, or without some over riding emergency; and when a levy was made on the order of the divan, he had to see that it was equitably distributed among all classes of tax-payers. He also supervised all transactions concerned with the revenue; and the 'amil, shahna, and other officials were to keep him fully informed of their activities and not to act without his agreement and approval. In a diploma issued by Sanjar's divan for the ra'is of Sarakhs, he is instructed inter alia not to allow demands to be made upon the people on behalf of leading members of the sultan's retinue or by others passing through the district, by the military (mutajannida), or by those having drafts for the collection of dues (favdrid) or fodder (falaj)? Clearly in the absence of coercive force provided by the govern ment, only a man of local standing could hope to carry out such instructions.

The ra'is had a divan or office, and in some cases had the power to appoint deputies to act for him. He was paid by dues (rusum) levied locally. He seems to have had some responsibility for the general conduct of affairs inside the city, and appears on occasion to have had powers of arrest and imprisonment. After Ghazali had been appointed mudarris of the Nizamiyya in Nishapur a group of persons were alleged to have intrigued against him, imputing to him unorthodox views; and one man changed some words in the text of a copy of the Mishkat alanwdr and the Munqidh min al daldl with the intention of incriminating Ghazali. Before signing the copy as correct, however, the author discovered the falsification. When the ra'is of Khurasan ( = ? Nishapur) learned of this he arrested the man and debarred him from residence in Nishapur. He accordingly left that town and went to the royal camp where he continued his intrigues until finally Sanjar summoned Ghazali to speak for himself. Ghazali duly came to court about the year 503/1109-10 and put his opponents to shame.1
In this brief examination of the internal structure of the Saljuq empire I have attempted to show that nothing, religious or temporal, lay outside the care and concern of the sultan. Ghazali's new definition of the relationship between the sultanate and the caliphate was an attempt to authorize the sultan's government (see above, pp. 207 ff.). This went far towards assuring the acceptance of his government as the effective organ through which Islamic government was expressed, or at least as the means for securing conditions in which the Islamic com munity could carry on its lawful purposes. And the attempt was to this extent successful, that after the caliphate was overthrown by the Mongols, although there was a temporary break with tradition, yet when the Mongol Il-Khans were converted to Islam their government was accepted—except by the more legalistically minded—as the govern ment of Islam. On the other hand, the fundamental disharmony in the organization of the state was perpetuated by Nizam al-Mulk's restate ment of "the old Persian tradition of monarchy, with its independent ethical standards based on force and opportunism".2 The Saljuqs, who had started out as the leaders of a tribal migration, were gradually transformed, partly under the influence of Ghazali and

Nizam al-Mulk, into the rulers of a centralized state. The formulation of its institutions was largely the achievement of Nizam al-Mulk, who modified and developed existing forms. The main features of the new organization of state—notably the structure of the divan, the iqtac system, and the close connexion between the assessment of taxes and the levy of troops—are also to be found (with changes in terminology) in the Safavid and Qajar periods. The main institutions of the Saljuq state were essentially bureaucratic, though the fact that many offices of the state were held by the military tends to obscure this fact. The measures taken to solve the two crucial problems of the state, namely the payment of its civil and military officials and the provision of armed forces for the preservation of order and the maintenance of defence, were bureaucratic devices; and though their abuse led to decentraliza tion and ultimately to the disintegration of the state, they did not of themselves involve decentralization. Through the officials of the divan, the muqta's and provincial governors, the officials of the religious institution, and local officials, the sultan came into contact with all aspects of the life of his people. But in the absence of any effective system of control over them, the officials of the central government showed a recurrent tendency to act unjustly, while local officials became petty despots, and the people in general tended to encroach upon one another's rights. Thus the population felt no real identification with the sultan or his government, which is perhaps why ethics and not politics provided the social ideal, and why the emphasis in the political literature of the time is on justice seen, not in terms of legal justice or anything expressed in specific and practical terms, but as the harmonious relationship between society in a divinely appointed system, the component parts of which were in a perfect equilibrium.



CHAPTER 3
RELIGION IN THE SALJUQ PERIOD
In the religious history of Iran the Saljuq period is particularly in teresting, for it is the period of the Isma'ilis. As the Isma'ili movement is treated in another part of the book, this chapter will be chiefly devoted to the three main aspects of religious life in Iran during this period: the development of Sunnism, the ferment of Shi'i ideas, and Sufism. Chronologically the Saljuq epoch in Iran extends roughly from the tenth to the twelfth centuries; obviously in this chapter we cannot always keep exactly within these limits. If we realize that in the years from the death of Ash'ari (935) to that of Ghazali (1111) the entire theological system of Islam found its final systematization; that it was also the period of Nizam al-Mulk's SiydsatNdma and of extremely interesting Shrt-Sunni polemics; and finally that in the twelfth century the oldest Su£i fariqafs (fraternities) were organized, some of the first great Muslim theological universities were founded, and the poet Nizami lived (1141-1209/13): realizing these facts, we can easily see the importance of the Saljuq era. Though not one of the most original, it is certainly one of the most formative epochs in the cultural history of Iran.
(1) SUNNISM
The stronghold of Sunnism was mostly eastern Iran, whereas Shi'i centres were typical of Persian "Iraq and Tabaristan (especially Qum, Ray and Aveh). Iranian Sunnism was chiefly Hanaf I and Shafi'i, and these two schools were not often on good terms. In the Kitdb al-naqd, a Shi'i polemic work of the first half of the twelfth century by Nasir al-Din Abu'lRashid al-Qazvini, an attempt is made at a sort of sectarian geography of Iran. The author observes that Khurasan and Transoxiana and part of 'Iraq were Hanafi and Muctazila in theology; Azarbaijan up to the borders of Anatolia, and Hamadan, Isfahan, Saveh, and Qazvin were Shafi'i, while their theology represented various schools (Ash'ari, Hanbali, etc.); the areas of Luristan, Khuzistan, Karaj, Gulpaigan, Bumjird, Nihavand were full of " anthropomorphists" (Mushabbiha, Mujassimd); and in Mazandaran, Qum, Kashan and Aveh there were Shicis.

A later work, also by a Shfi author, the Tabsirat al-aivdmm (be ginning of the thirteenth century), shows us the religious pattern of Saljuq Iran in more detail. The author distinguishes seven Sunni " sects ", distributed more or less as follows:
1. Dd'udl, " n o w no more in existence".
2. Hanaf I, theologically divided into Mu'ta^ila, Najjdriyya, Kardmiyya, Mur/Ta, and Jabriyya. The people of Khwarazm are Hanafi-Mu'tazili, the people of Bukhara and the "peasants" (rustd'i) of Kashan are Hanafi-Najjari; in Ghur and Sind there are Karamis, whereas the Hanafis of Kufa and Baghdad are Murji'a, and the Hanafis of Khurasan, Transoxiana, and Farghana are Jabri, as are the Turks.
3. Mdlikiy theologically divided into Khdriji(sic\ Mu'ta^ila, Mushab biha, Sdlimiyya (the Malikis of Basra), AsWari.
4. Shaft, theologically divided into six groups: Mushabbiha or " anthropomorphists " (Hamadan, Qara, Bumjird, Isfahan, Yazd, Herat, Salmas, Shiraz, etc.); Salafi, i.e. more moderate Mushabbiha; Khdriji ltd. by Husain Karabisi (according to this author all the Kharijis of Basra, Oman, and Isfara'in are Shafici-Karabisi); Mu'ta^ila, having as their imam Mawardi and Raghib Isfahani (the inhabitants of Mufradat, a town in Khuzistan between Basra and cAskar-i-Mukarram, are Shafi'iMu'tazila, who "in older times" were numerous in Fasa, and even " n o w " in Shiraz there is a half-ruined caravanserai, an old vaqf of the Shafici-Muctazila of Fasa); Asb'ari; and Ya^idi, who are spread from Zur to Syria (of Mushabbiha and Kharijite [sic] tendencies, they consider Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthman, Mu'awiya and Yazid to be "God-guided caliphs", but they often use taqiyya and include cAli also in the list of God-guided caliphs).
5. Hanbali. 6. Thauri(?). 7. Ishdq-Rdhawi: all three with Mushabbiha tendencies.
This rather confused list is interesting for its information on the geo graphical distribution of religious centres in Saljuq Persia. Of particular interest is the continuation of centres with Kharijite tendencies. Yaqut too (1179-1229) informs us that in this period there were many Kharijites in Sistan: they were not afraid of declaring openly their Kharijism, and they wore a special garb. As always happens in formative ages, religious debates and quarrels, often ending in massacres, were frequent. Even in moments of grave dangers religious antagonism was strong and active; according to



SUNNISM
285
Ravandi's Rabat a/-sudur, in Nishapur after the terrible onslaught of the Ghuzz (i 154) every night one sect would assault a quarter of the town inhabited by members of an enemy sect, and there they would kill and burn. Similar things happened in Shiraz between Hanafis and Shafi'is, in Ray between both of them and the Shi'is, and between all of them and the Isma'ilis. T o isolate a single racial or national element in Shi'I-Sunni disputes of this age is totally impossible. A verse like the following, composed in Arabic by an unknown poet of Ray and mentioned in the Shi'i work Kitab al-naqd, is typical:
Truly man is distinguished only by religion, and piety (taqwa) cannot be abandoned on account of racial reasons (fald'l-nasab). Islam exalted the Persian Salman, polytheism humiliated the noble Abu Lahab!
The same important text speaks of persecutions of Mushabbiha in Isfahan at the time of the Saljuq princes Mahmud and Mas'ud, while in Ray Hanafis of Mu'tazili tendencies were compelled by force to declare that the Qur'an was increate. The Saljuq Mas'ud b. Muhammad, influenced by Mu'tazili suggestions, persecuted followers of Mushab biha, Jabriyya, and Ash'ari tendencies in Qazvin, Ray, Isfahan, Baghdad and other places. The Kitab al-naqd, particularly significant as it is a Shici work, shows clearly that the great majority of Iranians were at that time Sunni with Ash'ari and even Mushabbiha tendencies; and the city of Isfahan is mentioned as a " capital city of Sunnism". A s often happens in fiery polemics, all parties abundantly used an insulting and abusing language, misrepresented facts, and so on. Poets also took part in the disputes: e.g. the famous Zahir-i Faryabi (d. 1201) jeered at Mu'tazilas, and Khaqani (d. 1199) attacked faldsifa (philosophers), Mu'attila, and Mu'tazila. Shi'is were fond of accusing all Sunnis of anthropomorphism and even of Isma'ilism, " because they apply ta'lim and taqlid as the Isma'ilis!"1 An ex-Shi'i convert to Sunnism wrote, soon before 1161, an anti-Shi'i book with the significant title " Some of the ignominies of the Shi'is " (Ba'dufadd'ih al-rawdfid), which contained a list of sixty-seven of these "ignominies". Qazvini's Kitdbu 'l-naqd, written as an answer to that book, bears the complete title: " Some vices of the Sunnis: a destruction of the ignominies of the Shi'is " (Ba'du mathdlib al-nawdsib fi naqd ba'd fadd'ih al-rawdfid). His book emphasizes especially the Mushabbiha aspects of Sunnism, and accuses the Sunnis of being blind

followers of the tradition, believers in predestination and enemies of the family of the Prophet. The Sunnis, for their part, tended to assimilate all forms of Shfism to Isma'ilism (at that time the supreme public danger). The book Fadd'ihalrawdfid says: " Shi'ismis the corridor leading to heresy" {rdfidi dihli^-i mulhidist). And when the same book says that the Shi'is are Zoroastrians under Muslim garb, it is repeating an older accusation (its initiator may have been Ibn Hazm, d. 1064), which is at the root of some unfounded modern assertions of a special similarity between Shi'ism and Zoroastrianism. A n interesting anti-Shi'i accusa tion in this book is the statement that the Shi'is propagandize especially in the lower classes and amongst ignorant artisans and that they are dahriyja (materialists). It is practically impossible to delineate here a history of the develop ment of Sunni ideas solely within Iran, regarded as a racial or national unit. The fact that Ghazali was Iranian is not of great importance, as he wrote in Arabic and his works were studied even as far away as Spain; whereas in Iran Sunnis, and also Shi'is, studied the religious works of their fellow believers spread throughout that vast unit which was the Islamic world. A chapter on Ghazali and his significance in the history of Muslim philosophy and theology can be found in any work on the history of Islam and has no place here. We will simply remark that he is one of the best representatives of that solid, clear, Khurasanian Sunnism that has been for centuries the religious milieu in which the greatest Iranian geniuses, literary and otherwise, have been bred. O f this Sunnism Ghazali is, in a way, the resume and the practical end: after him Sunnism did not produce much that is significant in the theological field. O n the other hand, Ghazali's radical mistrust of human reason and his consequent condemnation of philosophy; his intellectual aristocratism (he discouraged the common people from studying theology, saying they must only believe); his so often unjustly praised introduc tion of a moderate mysticism into orthodoxy, which killed all the most enthusiastic and progressive aspects of mysticism; his wish to make jurisprudence mystical and mysticism juridical—all of these achieve ments represent an end rather than a beginning, and their enormous influence has been quite detrimental for later Muslim culture. But the Saljuq period in Iran is not only the period of Ghazali. It is, as we said before, a formative age in which, side by side with the great synthesis of Ghazali, there existed other tendencies that are still alive and influential. It is the period in which the Mu'tazila school was

being finally vanquished by the Ash'arites, except for some nuclei of resistance in Iraq, Khwarazm, and Transoxiana. Four of the most famous figures here were: Juvaini (d. 1085), the master of Ghazali, known as Imam al-YLaramain \ in his epoch the greatest Shafi'i-Ash'ari theologian of Khurasan, and author of the important treatises Irshad, Shdmil, Ghiydthhu 'l-Umam, Muhaqqiq 'l-Haqq. He had many pupils besides Ghazali. One of them was 'Imad al-Din Kiya Harasi (d. 1110) of Tabaristan. Another Shafi'i-Ash'ari scholar of Saljuq Iran was al-Shahrastani (d. 1153), who served Sultan Sanjar and is chiefly famous as the author of the great heresiographical manual, al-Milal waH-nihal. He lived in Khurasan (Shahristan is a town there, near Nasa) and in Khwarazm. Amongst other works he wrote a commentary on the Qur'an. His Musdri'a is a polemical work against Avicenna, who is a favourite target of Ash'ari attacks. Ibn al-Jauzi (d. 1201) the author of the celebrated Talbis Iblis, " T h e Tricks of Satan", another heretical treatise; he lived in Baghdad and was so much venerated by all religious parties that sometimes disputes between Shi'is and Sunnis were brought to him to be arbitrated. Fakhr al-Din Razi (d. 1210), the author of the famous Tafsir of the Qur'an, a real encyclopaedia, of which somebody has said, Fibi kullu sbai' ilia?l-tafsir ("In it there is everything save a commentary on the Qur'an!"). He also wrote the Muhassil afkdr al-mutaqaddimin (arich historical summary of the ideas of Muslim theologians); one risdla (treatise) on the Prophet's Ascension, and other similar tracts. The famous al-Kasbshdf, a Mu'tazila commentary on the Qur'an by alZamakhshari (d. 1144), is also a fruit of the Persian religious genius of the Saljuq epoch. The growing influence of the orthodox Ash'arite school brought with it, of course, a decline in the speculative sciences. Ghazali's Tahdfut al-Faldsifa ("Destructio philosophorum") is only the most authoritative example of many similar attacks on philosophy, i.e. on purely speculative, Aristotelian and Neo-Platonic philosophy. A typical specimen of the orthodox Ash'arite attitude of this time towards science is this sentence in the theological treatise Ma/mu'a al-rasd'il al-kubrd: "Only the science transmitted to posterity through the Holy Prophet is worthy of the name of science (film). Other sciences are either sciences but not useful (ndfi1), or they are not sciences and not useful, or they are not sciences, but only called such, and not useful. If they are sciences

and useful they are certainly contained in the Prophet's heritage."1 According to Ghazali the three chief errors of the "philosophers" are the following: "They admit in God only the science of the Universals and not of particular things; they do not believe in the resurrection of the body and in the reality of eschatological facts; they regard the world as being uncreated." Although an uninterrupted chain of masters and pupils connected him with the great Master Avicenna, the philosopher—Farid Ghilani of Balkh (twelfth century) nevertheless wrote a treatise (Risdla huduth al'dlam) in confutation of Avicenna, and especially of his theory of the uncreatedness of the world. A s Avicenna had long been regarded as the philosopher par excellence, many of these attacks simply took the form of attacks on him personally. He was criticized from two sides: from the left, by such rationalist philosophers as Averroes (d. 1199), who thought his Aristotelian tendencies were impure; and from the right by such theologians as Shahrastani, Farid Ghilani, and Fakhr al-Din Razi, and even by poets influenced by the general Ash'arite atmosphere (e.g. Sana'i, d. 1141, and Khaqani, d. 1199). Amongst the most important religious philosophers of the Saljuq epoch we may mention several in particular. Abu'l-'Abbas Fadl b. Muhammad al-Lukari of Marv, a pupil of Avicenna's pupil Bahmanyar, was the author of the Baydn al-haqq bidiman as-sidaq and other works. The Baydn al-haqq, still unpublished, utilizes parts of previous works by Farabi, Avicenna, and others, and is divided into five parts: logic, natural history, theology, metaphysics, ethics. Lukari exercised a great influence on the Persian philosophers of this age for he had numerous pupils, though not all of them remained faithful to Avicennism, as we saw. Amongst his pupils were A b u Tahir Tabasi of Marv (d. 1145)w l t k his pupil Abu Sa'id Funduwarji, and also the qadi cAbd al-Razzaq Turki, al-Ilaqi, the aforementioned Farid Ghilani, the physician Hasan Qattan of Marv, and As'ad al-Maihani (d. 1133). Lukari was a contemporary of the great astronomer and poet 'Umar Khayyam, who, though not strictly a philosopher or a theologian, must be mentioned here if only because he symbolizes a different direction of Persian thought in this age. The orthodox opinion on him is well expressed in the mystical work Mirsddal-ibddby Daya (1223), in which Khayyam, though praised as "famous for his talents, his wisdom,

SUNNISM
intelligence and doctrine", is associated with "those unfortunate philosophers and materialists, who, detached from divine blessings, wander in stupefaction and error". In one of his quatrains (129 of Furughi's edition) Khayyam himself refuses the title of ^ / ^ / ( " p h i l o sopher"), in the sense of an Aristotelian one, saying he desires simply " t o know who I am". A n anecdote reported in the Tatimma siwdn alhikma connects the name of 'Umar Khayyam with that of another philosopher and physician of this age, Abu'l-Barakat Hibat Allah aiBaladi or al-Baghdadi (d. 115 2), a Jew who served under the 'Abbasid Caliph al-Mustarshid Bi'llah, and, taken prisoner by the Saljuq prince Mas'ud, accepted Islam. Abu'l-Barakat is the author of famous books such as al-Mu'tabar, Kitab an-nafs, and a commentary on Aristotle's psychology. He strongly criticized Avicenna, and according to the anecdote mentioned above, 'Umar Khayyam, requested by the Kakuyid prince 'Ala' al-Daula of Yazd to express his opinion on the dissension between the two philosophers, is said to have remarked: " A b u ' l Barakat does not even understand the sense of the words of Avicenna, how can he oppose what he does not know ? " The names of other philosophers of this age—such as A b u Sa'id alGhanimi, author of Qurddat at-tabViydt\ Zain al-Din al-Sawi, a con temporary of Sultan Sanjar, a pupil of Ilaqi and author of treatises on logic, and so on—would mean little to the non-specialist reader. The importance of the Saljuq period lies especially in the fact that religious learning was organized in great teaching institutions, which might be considered to be amongst the first universities of the civilized world. For in this way the bases were laid for almost all the organized institutions of Muslim religious culture. In this work the great vizier Nizam al-Mulk was most active; the institutions he founded took the name of Ni%dmiyya, and they were like colleges, with scholarships, good salaries for the professors, and a traditional and well-organized course of studies. Especially famous were the Nizamiyyas of Baghdad (founded in 1065-7) and Nishapur, though others were present in all the chief towns of the Saljuq sultanate. The professors in Baghdad and Nishapur were appointed by Nizam al-Mulk and, after his death, by his heirs. All the other colleges were imitations of the Nizamiyya: one of the most important of this period is the Mustamiriyya of Baghdad, founded in the years 1228-34 by the 'Abbasid Caliph al-Mustansir Bi'llah, The teaching in all these universities {madrasas) was done by the mudarrises (professors) and their mu'ids (assistants). The professor used to teach

seated on a kursi (a sort of chair), and he wore a special gown called a tarha and a turban; two mu'ids were seated at his side, repeating his words to the students and explaining difficult points. The curriculum studiorum consisted of fiqh (Muslim law) hadith (traditions of the Prophet), tafsir (exegesis of the Qur'an), literary theory, mathematics, and medicine. Every student had his own hujra (a small room) and a monthly stipend. In these madrasas, and also elsewhere, there were rich libraries. T o take only an example given by Yaqut in his Mu'jam: in Marv there were ten vaqf libraries, some of them containing 12,000 volumes. Books could be borrowed without any restrictions (Yaqut himself had two hundred in his house at one time!).
(2) SHI'ISM
Before the sixteenth century, when it succeeded in becoming the official religion of an organized political unit, Safavid Iran, Shi'ism consisted chiefly of widespread "centres of resistance", a sort of fermentation of ideas to which it is very difficult to assign a well-defined geographical area. Such centres were by no means limited to Iran, which in Saljuq times was perhaps a more Sunni country than was Anatolia or Syria; but since Persia was to become—and not always by peaceful meansa Shici country four centuries later, it is of special interest to study the position of Shi'ism in the Saljuq era, in order to try to discover some elements of historical continuity. The chief sources for our study are the two controversial works mentioned above, the Kitdb al-naqd of Qazvini, and the Fadd'ih ar-rawdfid, together with the "History of Religions ", Tabsiratu cl-awdmm> by Sayyid Murtada Razi. O f the numerous Shi'i sects only four retain importance in this period in Iran: (1) the Nasiri, a name given in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries to those extremists who attributed to 'Ali divine or quasidivine powers (all other Shi'is, including Isma'Ilis, considered these heretical and kdfir (unbeliever)); (2) the Zaidls; (3) the Ismd'ilis; and (4) the Imamis (Twelvers). The Zaidis in the Saljuq period were subdivided into four com munities : the JdrudiyyajSarhubiyya were followers of Abu'l-Jarud, a contemporary of the imam al-Baqir, who, as a reproach for his "hypo crisy" (nifdq), had called him Sarhub, one of the names of Satan; then there were the]aririyya\Sulaimdniyya; thzBatriyya, followers of Kuthaiyyir an-Nawwa' al-Abtar; and the Ya'qubiyya.

The Jarudiyya considered the leaders of the Islamic community before 'Ali to be usurpers and kdfir (unbelievers). Some of them believed that their Mahdi was the lord of Taliqan (in Badakhshan), Muhammad b. 'All b. 'Umar b. 'Ali b. Husain b. 'Ali, imprisoned by the Caliph alMu'tasim (833-42). Others proclaimed as Mahdi the prince of Kufa, Yahya b. 'Umar b. Yahya b. Husain b. Zaid b. 'All, eventually killed during the caliphate of al-Musta'in (862-6). The Jaririyya/Sulaimaniyya held different views from the Jarudiyya, especially with respect to the transmission of the imamate. For the Jarudiyya, as for the Twelvers, it was transmitted by nass (explicit designation by the former imam), whereas the Jaririyya/Sulaimaniyya adopted the Sunni idea of the transmission of the imamate by shurd (consultation). For them Abu Bakr and 'Umar were sinners but not kafir. Not so 'Uthman, who, having introduced (according to them) anti-Islamic bid'as (innovations, heresies) was truly a kafir. The Batriyya were even more moderate than the Jaririyya, holding the idea that, though 'Ali was after the Prophet the noblest of creatures, the caliphates of Abu Bakr and 'Umar were still legitimate, because 'AH himself had abandoned his pretensions to the imamate; similar ideas were defended also by the Ya'qubiyya. Theologically the Zaidis were Mu'tazila, and in jurisprudence they were practically identical with the Sunnis inasmuch as they considered qiyds, rayj, ijtihdd, and istihsdn to be good shar'i sources of law. They regarded as invalid all imams after 'Ali son of Husain, and as kafir all those who did not accept, after him, the imamate of Zaid and the holy war. In the Saljuq period Zaidis were still comparatively strong in those regions that had been their stronghold in the ninth and tenth centuries, i.e. Dailam, Gilan, Tabaristan, and Gurgan. In some of these areas during the lifetime of the author of the Kitdb al-naqd, the Zaidis still read the khutba in the name of their imams, and struck coins in their name. Apart from the Isma'ilis (treated in another chapter of this volume) the strongest Shi'I sect of the Saljuq epoch were the Imdmiyya, or Twelvers, as Western orientalists call them. The Saljuqs affirmed their power in Iran just at the moment when Shi'i elements—compara tively strong in Dailam, Tabaristan, Persian and Arab 'Iraq, Khuzistan, and Kirman—together with the powerful Isma'ili movement were preparing the way for the destruction of the 'Abbasid caliphate. Based on the strong Sunni centres of eastern Iran, and finding its best and most honest representative in the great personality of Nizam al-Mulk,

the vizier of Malik-Shah, the inflexible Sunnism of the Saljuqs gave new life to the moribund Sunni caliphate of Baghdad. This passage from the famous Siydsat-Ndma of Nizam al-Mulk is illuminating:
In the days of Mahmud, Mas'ud, Tughril, and Alp-Arslan (may Allah have mercy on them) no Zoroastrian or Jew or Rafidi would have had the audacity to appear in a public place or to present himself before a great man. Those who administered the affairs of the Turks were all professional civil servants and secretaries from Khurasan, who belonged to the orthodox Hanafi or Shafi'i sects. The heretics of Iraq were never admitted as secretaries and tax collectors; in fact the Turks never used to employ them at all; they said, "These men are of the same religion as the Dailamites and their supporters; if they get a firm footing they will injure the interests of the Turks and cause distress to the Muslims. It is better that enemies should not be in our midst." Consequently they lived free from disaster.1
This passage shows how one of the racially purest Iranian zones, Khurasan, was strongly Sunni, whereas Shi'ism seemed identified with 'Iraqi, western Iranian, and even Arabic tendencies: further proof, if necessary, that the present Shi'ism of Iran has nothing to do with race. The Siydsat-Ndma is full of episodes and anecdotes showing the strong anti-Shi'i tendencies of the influential author, who, for propa gandist reasons, often lumped all Shi'is together with the much-feared Isma'ilis; indeed Shi'i resentment was one of the causes of Nizam alMulk's eventual dismissal, after which Shi'i influence began to grow. Nevertheless, in spite of the Saljuqs' anti-Shi'i policy, Shi'i centres were flourishing in Iran, as elsewhere, during this period. Shi'is had their own madrasas, mosques, and libraries, and, as the protests expressed in the above passage show, they even succeeded in penetrating into court life: thus Hibat Allah Muhammad b. 'All (known as Ibn al-Muttalib) was a minister of the Caliph al-Mustazhir; Sa'd al-Mulk Avaji was vizier to Sultan Muhammad b. Malik-Shah, and Sharaf al-Din Anushirvan b. Khalid Kashani was vizier to both the Caliph al-Mustarshid and Sultan Mahmud b. Malik-Shah. That orthodox Sunnis were preoccupied with the slow penetration of Shi'i elements into official posts is also clear from the Fadd'ih al-rawdfid, which expresses the fear of an alliance between " T u r k s " (i.e. the Saljuq ruling class) and Shi'ism: " N o w [c. 1165] there is no sardi of Turks that has not at least ten orfifteenravdfid, and many of them are employed as dabirs in the divans"2. The Shi'i author of the Kitdb al-naqd even has words in praise of the " T u r k s " who sometimes used to protect the Shi'is in the period following

the death of Nizam al-Mulk and Malik-Shah. Shi'i influences were particularly strong in Khwarazm, perhaps because this region was a traditional stronghold of Mu'tazilism: it is known that at the beginning of the thirteenth century the Khwarazm-Shah Muhammad went so far as to propose the cAlid 'Ala' al-Mulk as caliph, and to invite the 'ulama of his country to declare the 'Abbasids unworthy of the caliphate, which should have belonged to the Husainis.1 Amongst the propaganda techniques used by the Shi'is to spread their beliefs and influence was that of the mandqibis or manaqib-khwans. Mandqib means " virtues " and mandqib-khwdn is a singer who extols the virtues of'AH and his descendants in streets and bazaars. The manaqibis had existed in Iraq since the Buyid period, and their activity had continued more or less secretly into the period of the early Saljuqs in 'Iraq and Tabaristan; in order to avoid persecutions they often migrated from place to place. The Kitdb al-naqd, speaking of the situation after the death of Malik-Shah, says that the manaqib-khwans used to sing qasidas in praise of the Shi'i imam because he had attacked the Sunni "usurpers". These qasidas also contained doctrinal and theological elements, such as the concept of tan^ih (the absolute transcendence of God, as opposed to anthropomorphism); that of 6adl(the justice of God, as opposed to the Ash'ari idea of His arbitrary power); that of the imams' 'isma (infallibility and impeccability), of their miracles, and so on. Moreover in their fantastic tales of the military exploits of 'All and his paladins, the poems were like " religious epical songs". Unfortu nately these older poems are almost completely lost, but we have good specimens of this kind of folk-religious Shi'i epic in the Safavid period. The Kitdb al-naqd gives us also the names of some Shi'i poets (to be distinguished from the mandqibis, who were mere singers), of whom the most famous in the twelfth century was Qivami of Ray.
T o counterbalance the manaqib-khwans' influence the Sunnis em ployedfadd'il-khwdns (also meaning " singers of virtues "), who exalted the superior virtues of Abu. Bakr and 'Umar and insulted the Shi'is. The Kitdb al-naqd, in a very interesting passage, tells us that their poems were imitations of those of the Shi'is (and this is probably correct), that in them they taught the dogmas of jabr (predestination) and tashbih (anthropomorphism), and instead of singing of the "true" holy wars of 'All and his companions, " they invented false wars and unfounded stories concerning Rustam, Suhrab, Isfandiyar, Ka'us, Zal, etc., and

sent their singers to spread these idle tales (turrahdt) in all the bazaars of the country, as a confutation {raid) of the bravery and virtue of the Prince of the Believers ('All). This heretical practice (bid'ai) is still observed now, and it is truly a heresy and an aberration to sing the praises of Zoroastrians (gabrakdn) in the holy Nation of Muhammad (blessings on him!)".1 Imámite Shi'ism appears here, in its true light, as an essentially Islamic movement, which, in Iran, not only had nothing to do with pre-Islamic ideas, but condemned them more strongly than it did the traditional Iranian Sunnism. According to some texts it is also in this epoch that the taziyas (not in the modern sense theatrical plays) experience a sort of revival. These mourning ceremonies in commemoration of the martyrdom of Husain at Karbalá seem to have been started or developed first under the Büyids, and under the Saljuqs they were sometimes practised by the Sunnis too (Hanafi and Shafi'i), and "even in strong Sunni towns, like Hamadán". Where in Iran were the Shi'is most numerous at this period ? The list of such places has become almost a TOTTOS in various religious books of this epoch, leading one to suspect that it is a formula inherited from older heretical treatises rather than a result of actual observations of facts. The places most commonly mentioned in connexion with the Shi'is are Qum, Ray, and Aveh (this last being Aveh of Sáveh, mentioned also by Yáqüt as a fervent Shi'i centre). Summing up the information given in the Tabsiratu H-'awdmm, the Kitdb al-naqd, and the Rabat alsudür, we see that, besides Baghdad and its famous Shi'i quarter of Karkh, the " Shi'i centres " in Saljuq Iran were chiefly considered to be Káshán, Tafrish, Aveh, Qum, Ray, Qazvin, Sari, Iram, and zones in Mázandarán; in Khurasan there were some Shi'is in Nishápür and Sabzavár. But rather than denoting organized Shi'i communities, some of these names hint at the presence of generically Shi'i ferment, some times in the sense of Ismá'Ili or Bdtini ferment. I wonder whether verses like those of Shams al-Din Lághari, quoted in the Rabat al-sudür, may be taken as real proofs of the presence of organized Twelver Shi'i communities in the localities mentioned:
Sire, the place of Bátinis are Qum, Káshán, Aba, and Tabrish; Vindicate, therefore, the honour of the Four Companinns [the " orthodox" caliphs of the Sunnis], and throw fire into these four places, Then burn Faráhan and Muslihgáh, so that the recompense of thy meri torious works may be multiplied!

SHTISM
More reliable information is that given by the Kitdb al-naqd, which mentions the following Shi'i madrasas of this epoch (second half of the twelfth century): in Ray, a traditional centre of Shi'ism, the madrasa founded by Sayyid Taj al-Din Muhammad Gilaki, a contemporary of Toghril Beg, and the madrasas of Shams al-Islam Haska Babuya and many others, some containing from 200 to 400 pupils; in Qum the madrasa of Athir al-Mulk, of Sayyid 'Izz al-Din Murtada, and so on (altogether eight are mentioned for Qum); and in Kashan the madrasas called Safawiyya, the Najdiyya, the Sharafiyya, etc., with learned masters like Imam 2iya' al-Din Abu'l-Rida Fadl Allah b. 'All alHusaini. In Aveh the madrasas 'Izz al-Mulki, 'Arabshahi, and others are mentioned; in Varamin the Ridawiyya and Fathiyya, and in Sabzavar there were " g o o d madrasas and teachers, which from generation to generation taught the Law of Islam".1 Shi'i culture in this epoch produced remarkable religious works. More or less at the beginning of the period the important Qur'anic commentary of the Shi'i doctor A b u Ja'far Tusi (d. 1068) was com posed, and a summary of it by Ibn Idris al-Hilli belongs to the twelfth century (Hilll died in 1182). In the first half of this century the Shi'is produced a Qur'anic commentary in Persian, that of Jamal al-Din Razi; and another venerated Shi'i scholar, Shaikh Tabarsi (d. 1153), composed three Qur'anic commentaries, the most important of which is the Ala/ma6 al-baydn in Arabic (translated into Persian in the nineteenth century). The majority of Shi'i theologians of this period were pole micists, but they laid the bases of that methodical Shi'i theology which flourished especially in the next century in the personality of Nasir al-Din Tusi—sometimes considered the greatest of all Shi'i theologians. Amongst the Shi'i polemical works we may mention Shaikh Tusi's Ithbdt al-wdjib and Talkhis ash-shaft; a summary of a work by Sayyid Murtada (d. 1045); written against al-Mughm ft H-imdma by the Qadi 'Abd al-Jabbar Mu'tazili of Hamadan (d. 1023), and concerned with such problems as the legitimacy of the imamate. Another polemical writer was Abu'l-Qasim Husain b. Muhammad of Isfahan, known as Raghib (d. 1108), who wrote al-Dhart'a ild makdrim al-shartca. Qazvini's Kitdb al-naqd, composed around 1165, has already been mentioned. This epoch produced a remarkable number of those compositions, partly heresiographic and polemical, partly theological and historical, which could be defined as forerunners of our modern

handbooks of comparative religion. The oldest one in Persian was written in 1092 by a Shi'i, Abu'l-Ma'ali Muhammad 'Ubaid Allah, and bore the title Bayan al-adydn ( " A n Explanation of Religions"). T o the later Saljuq period belongs the Tabsirat al-awdmm of Sayyid Murtada Da'I Hasani of Ray, also a sort of encyclopaedia of religions containing useful data.
(3) SUFISM
The second half of the eleventh century, all of the twelfth, and the be ginnings of the thirteenth may be considered one of the most important periods in the history of Sufism, not only in Iran but everywhere. In the second half of the eleventh century in Transoxiana, Khurasan, and Iraq, great Sufi saints lived, each one in small convents (khdnqdh)% praying, meditating, and teaching new pupils. A s we said in relation to Ghazali, it is in the Saljuq period that Sufism, after years of distrust and even persecution by members of the orthodoxy, found its way in a modified form into Sunni orthodoxy itself. Qushairi and then Ghazali, both Ash'ari (at first sight a rather anti-mystical position!), gave to Sufism full rights of citizenship in Sunnism; whereas Shfism (seem ingly a more favourable ground for mystical ideas) generally, at least in older periods, opposed Sufism, sometimes in a very violent manner. It is in the twelfth century that the oldest organized tariqats of Sufism were founded, and some important parts of the tariqat ritual were introduced. Massignon and Kahle are of the opinion that the initiation ritual of the Sufi brotherhoods was first created in this century, imi tating the Qarmati (Isma'ili) ritual. Further, the document of initiation (ijd^a) with its si/si/a, a sort of spiritual chain of the names of all the Masters of the brotherhood, seems to have been used for the first time towards the end of the Saljuq period, in 1227.1 It is also in this century that the coenobitic life of ikhwdn (brothers) in a cloister (khangab) found its first developments, though we may find traces of a communal life of mystics in earlier texts.2 The first organized Sufi brotherhood in Iran were the Kazamniyya (Shiraz, 1034), in its beginnings a mystical school rather than a real "order"; but most important were the three branches of an originally common school (Junaidiya): i.e. the Khwajagan (founded by Yusuf Hamadani, d. 1140), which spread, especially in Turkestan, through its branch

the Yasaviyya; secondly, the Kubrawiyya (founded in Khurasan by Najma '1-Din Kubra, d. 1221); and thirdly, the famous Qadiriyya, organized in Baghdad some decades after the death of its spiritual originator, the famous saint 'Abd al-Qadir Gilani, d. 1166). T o these first tariqats we may add the Rifa'iyya, with its centre in Basra (founded by al-Rifa'i, d. 1183), the Suhravardiyya of Baghdad, founded by ' A b d al-Qahir Suhravardi (d. 1167) and £Umar Suhravardl (d. 1234), and later the Chishtiyya, which spread through the eastern zones of Iran, Afghanistan, and India in the thirteenth century; its centre was Ajmir, India, where the tomb of its founder Mu'in al-Dln Chishti (d. 1236) is situated. A t the beginning of the Saljuq era some of the great Sufis of the older pre-tariqat period of Sufism were still living in Iran. Abu Sa'Id b. Abi'l-Khair, the first mystical poet of Iran (d. 1048-9), and the equally famous Sufi theoretician Qushairi (d. 1073) were both active in Khura san, where they left many disciples. Soon after them come such men as Hujviri, Khwaja Ahmad Sarakhsi, and Abu 'Abdallah Baku; the Chishtis, spiritual offspring of Khwaja Ahmad Chishti, d. 966 (Chisht is a town in Khurasan), included Muhammad b. Abi Ahmad, Yusuf b. Muhammad b. Sam'an (d. 1067), and Qutb al-Dln b. Maudud Chishti (d. 1133), all very well known at the time of the Greater Saljuqs. It was in the same region, Khurasan, that the fame of Khwaja 'Abdallah Ansari (d. 1089), the great writer and saint buried in Herat, began to spread in this period. Some time earlier, Khwaja Yahya b. 'Amrnar al-Shaibani, disciple of the Shirazi saint Ibn Khafif, had gone to Herat and was active there in spreading Sufi teachings. One of the greatest Sufis of Khurasan was the Shaikh al-Shuyukh A b u 'All Farmadi, who lived in the second half of the eleventh century. He was a spiritual disciple of Abu al-Hasan Kharraqani, Abu Sa'id b. Abi'l-Khair, Abu'lQasim Gurgani, and of Qushairi, and in his turn became master of the Sunni theologian al-Ghazali, whose brother Ahmad Ghazali, author of the mystical work Sawanih, is also a very famous Sufi of this epoch (d. 1123). Farmadi was also the master of Shaikh Abu Bakr b. "Abdallah Nassaj of Tus, who in his turn had numerous pupils at the end of the twelfth century. Pupils of Ahmad Ghazali included the famous author of the Maqamdt, Badi 'al-Zaman Hamadani (killed as a heretic in 1131), Shaikh Abu'1-Fadl Baghdad! (115 5)—the first link in the spiritual chain of Ni'matallah Wall (d. 1430), a later founder of the mystic order of the Nicmatallahi—and Diya' al-Din Suhravardi.

298
In Transoxiana the above-mentioned Khwaja Abu Ya'qub Yusuf Hamadani, of the school of Farmadi and founder of the Yasaviyya/ Khwajagan brotherhood, had many pupils, among whom cAbd alKhaliq Ghijduwani, 'Abdallah Barqi, Hasan Andaqi, and Ahmad Basavl are particularly famous. In Khwarazm the greatest Sufi of this epoch was Abu'l-Janab Najm al-Din al-Khiwaqi, known as Kubra, who was killed in 1221 during the invasion of his native country by the Mongols. He is also known as Shaikh-i Vall-Tardsh ("the Creator of Saints"), because of the great number of Sufi disciples who followed his teachings, and he founded the Sufi brotherhood of the Kubrawiyya. He was, like all the great Sufis of Iran in this time, a Sunni (Shafi'i): " W e think", he wrote, " that the best creatures are Muhammad, the Prophet of God, then Abu Bakr, then 'Urnar, then 'Uthman, then 'All; and we love the people of His house, the Good, the Pure ones, from whom God took away any trace of impurity and whom He made pure and near to Him." That he showed a particular veneration for 'All and his descendants (in Mongol times this respect was to become accentuated in some of his disciples) is a common quality of Sufism and not peculiar to him. Amongst his first disciples were Abu. Sa'id Majd al-Din Sharaf b. Mu'ayyad Baghdad! (d. 1211 or 1219, a native of Baghdadak in Khwarazm, not to be con founded with Baghdad), and Sa'd al-Din Muhammad b. Mu'ayyad Hamuya (d. 1252), author of difficult and still not sufficiently studied esoteric and cabbalistic works such as the Kitdb sajanjal al-arwahy in which, according to some, he expressed Shi'i tendencies: e.g. after Muhammad, he said, there was a chain of twelve auliyd, saints, not imams. Saif al-Din Bakharzi (d. 1260) was another disciple, active in Bukhara and author of famous quatrains; other Sufis were Jamal al-Din Jill, Baba Kamal Jundl, Najm al-Din Razl, called Daya, author of the famous mystical work Mirsad alJibdd (1223); and Baha' Valad (d. 1230), father of the greatest Sufi of Iran, Jalal al-Din Rumi.
As is clear from all these data, the development of Sufism in this epoch took place especially in the eastern, more strictly Sunni, zones of the Iranian cultural world. In the western part of this world, with its spiritual centre in Baghdad, Sufism was spread above all by the Suhravardiyya brotherhood, founded, as we saw, by A b u Hafs 'Umar Suhravardi, the real founder of the tariqat of this name, though its silsila goes back to his uncle ' A b d al-Qahir, a pupil of Ahmad Ghazall. A b u Hafs 'Umar is the author of many books {Kitdb al-awdrif, Kashf

an-nasd'ih, Flam al-taqi, Flam al-hudd, etc.) and had very famous students, including the great poet Sa'di, the poet Auhad al-Dln Kirmani, and Ahmad Basavi. As we said before, most Shi'is in this epoch were much more antiSufi than the Sunnis were; the pro-Sufi attitude of many Shi'i com munities of later ages, and especially of modern Iran, is an interesting phenomenon in the religious history of the country, which cannot, how ever, justify the anachronistic attitude of those modern Iranian scholars who try to attribute Shi'i tendencies to Sufis of earlier epochs. The Shi'i attitude towards Sufism in the Saljuq period is clearly exemplified by the Shi'i "History of Religions", the Tabsirat al-awdmm by Sayyid Murtada Razi, who distinguishes the Sufis of his epoch into six sects: (i) The pantheists, followers of the ideas of al-Hallaj (d. 922), who affirm the ittihdd (the complete unification, or fusion, of the soul of the mystic with G o d ) ; (2) the 'Ushshdq (lovers), who preach detachment and love of G o d as propaedeutic to the acquisition of occult doctrines; (3) the Nuriyja (from niir = " l i g h t " ) , who affirm the existence of two kinds of veils between man and God, a veil of light and a veil of fire (nur and ndr); (4) the Vdsilijya, who say that the practices of the shari'a are a useful preparation for approaching God, but are no longer needed by those who have reached (vdsil) God. (And, our Shi'i author adds deprecatingly, all the Sufis of the period are vdsill); (5) those who deny the utility of science and logic, saying that arguments based on them are vain, since the only true science lies in humble obedience to the Master; they say also that faith is not a created thing or attitude, but a divine act, and all divine acts are uncreated; and finally (6) those immoral and despicable Sufis who assume the garb of wandering beggars. The same author affirms that "all the Sufis are Sunnis", which is for him a very strong argument for their condemnation; indeed the greatest figures in the history of Sufism (Hallaj, Bayazid Bistami, Shibli, and so on) are stamped with the worst maledictions and treated as pantheists, sorcerers, vyndiqs (dualists), and, generally speaking, as antinomians. In spite of the Sufis' deep penetration into orthodox Sunni circlesaccomplished, as we saw, precisely in this epoch—an anti-Sufi attitude is of course still present in some orthodox Sunni writers. Talbis Iblis, by the Ash'ari theologian Ibn al-Jauzi, contains strong attacks on the Sufis, though the author makes a clear distinction between an older, purer Sufism, and the "modern" one, for which he shows distrust. Ibn al~Jauzi gives us in his book precious information on the Sufi life



RELIGION IN THE SALJUQ PERIOD
of his age. He says that the Sufis of the twelfth century owned many rihdts in which they led a merry life, whereas for the older mystics the ribats were places of asceticism. Some of the convents had been erected by unjust princes with stolen money, which they wanted to "purify" through these holy foundations (vaqf), and those who frequented them were quite different from the Bishrs and Junaids of the past. Imitating the old companions of the Prophet, early Sufis used as their garment the austere khirqa (a robe made of shreds and patches of various colours), but some wore a woollen vest under it. They used to eat but little, and before the ceremony of initiation they fasted for two months. Some Sufis organized for their sdliks (disciples) periods of forty days of halffasting called arba'iniyya (arba'in = " f o r t y " in Arabic) during which they ate only fruit; and some of them grew so accustomed to fasting that they had temptations and visions and sometimes fell into immoral habits. Now, however (he adds), there are Sufis who exaggerate in the opposite direction and eat abundantly. The habits Ibn al-jauzl most energetically disapproves of in Sufis are laziness and mendicity, both forbidden by the canonical law of Islam. Nor does samd' (singing and dancing) meet with his sympathy, though it was prudently accepted by Ghazali, who devoted an interesting book of his Ihyd? to the problem of the canonical legality of sama'. Both Ghazali and Ibn al-Jauzi mention the habit, current amongst Sufis in their time, of tearing away garments in the paroxysm of ecstatical dances, and of distributing their pieces (considered to be full of baraka, or mystical force) to those present. Ghazali gives a canonical reinterpretation of this, accepting it as a sort of surrogate alms, when the pieces torn away are sufficient to patch garments of poor people.1 Ibn al-Jauzi also speaks critically of the dangerous practice of the intercourse of Sufis with the shdhids (beautiful youths, symbols of the beauty of the Creator). Sufis of his time, how ever, had a strong predilection for celibacy and loved to travel without any provisions, relying only on G o d (tavakkul). Their contempt for the sciences, their calling the canonical law of Islam 'ilm-i %dhir (purely exoteric science) and their own doctrines Hlm-i bdtin (esoteric science), their disdain for logic and law once they had realised their " truths "none of this met with the approval of the author. In spite of all such opposition, Sufis in this epoch were fairly free to teach their doctrines and carry out their practices. They easily found protectors in princes and powerful personalities. One of the greatest of

their protectors in the Saljuq era was the great vizier Nizam al-Mulk himself. According to Muhammad b. Munawwar in his Asrdr al-tauhldy composed in the second half of the twelfth century, he had been in his youth a pupil of the famous A b u Sa'id b. A b i '1 Khair, and had wit nessed miracles performed by that saint. He is said to have remarked: "All that I have, I owe to Shaikh Abu Sa'id." He founded many khanqahs, and gave much money to the embryonic Sufi organisms of his age. Not one of the least of the Sufis' contributions to Iranian culture lay in their ample use of poetry to teach their doctrines: the first great mystic poet, Sana'i of Ghazna lived in this epoch. Though not strictly speaking a Sufi, and active outside as well as inside Iran, Shihab al-Din Suhravardi " M a q t u l " (1153-91)—not to be confounded with the other Suhravardis mentioned above—is one of the most original thinkers of the eastern Islamic world in this epoch. This " M a s t e r of the doctrine of ishrdq" (Shaikh al-ishrdq) was born in Suhravard, in north-western Iran, and his early education was also in Iranian territory, at Maragheh and Isfahan. He was chiefly active in Syria, where he was killed—allegedly for religious motives, but probably also for political reasons—by order of the great Ayyubid Sultan Salah al-Din, the " Saladin" of Western histories and legends. He can be classified neither as a Sufi nor as a philosopher, neither as Sunni nor as Shi'i, and in this isolated originality lies his greatness. He could be called perhaps a theosophist, apart from the modern implications of this word, or a gnostic; but many of his ideas (the development of a sort of mystical Neo-Platonism with clear Isma'ili influences) and also a great part of his terminology are original and do not follow the accepted patterns. This, and his openly expressed contempt both for the tradi tional Aristotelian philosophy of the schools and for the orthodox legalism of the theologians, even accentuated his "heterodoxy". Moreover in his works he consciously attempted to revive the older Hermetic/Pythagorian/Iranian tradition. F o r instance, in his Talmhdt he says: " . . . K n o w thou that the Exalted Wise Men (al-hukarnd alkihdr) of old, since the times in which Wisdom was orally transmitted, such as the Father of the Wise, the Father of Fathers, Hermes, and before him Agathodaimon and Pythagoras and Empedocles and the Prince of the Wise, Plato, were of much greater dignity and of much higher spiritual stature than all those subtle loici we know amongst the M u s l i m s . . .

RELIGION IN THE SALJUQ PERIOD
of spiritual silsila in which old Iranian names occur alongside those of Greeks, Egyptians, and Muslims :
The last one amongst the Greeks who had an exact notice of that Annihi lating Light that leads to the Lesser Death was Plato, the sublime Wise one. And amongst the Great ones, the one who consolidated his knowledge, and whose name remains eternal in the histories, was Hermes. Amongst the "Pahlavis" ["old Iranian traditions " , fahlaviyyln\ it was the first man [mâlik al-tln, "the possessor of the clay"] called Gayumart, and in his school (sbî'a) Farïdùn and Kai-Khusrau. For what concerns the lights of the mystical path [suluM\ in these times nearer to us the leaven of the Pythagorians fell into Akhï Akhmïm [the famous Egyptian Muslim mystic Dhû '1-Nûn, d. 860] and from him it descended into the Contemplative Wanderer (sayjâr) of Tustar [Abu Sahl al-Tustari of the ninth century] and into his school; whereas the leaven of the Khusravànids, in the Mystical Path, descended into the Contemplative Wanderer of Bistàm [Bâyazïd Bistàmï, d. 874] and after him into the Divine Knight {fata) of Baidâ [Mansùr al-Hallâj, the mystical martyr, killed in 922] and afterwards into the Divine Wanderer of Âmul and Kharraqân [Abu'l-Hasan al-Kharraqànï]...1
These doctrines were therefore, for him, the common patrimony from an ancient tradition of which Iran was a part, a tradition that originated in the Hellenistic syncretism of the first centuries of the Christian era. This allegedly " o l d " doctrine, actually perfected and developed by Suhravardi's undeniable theosophical genius, cannot be outlined here. It is sufficient to say that Suhravardi did not remain an isolated thinker; after he died his ishrâqi ideas, more or less openly professed, found their way first into Iranian Sùfism and Shi'ism, and later, sometimes through dim and secret historical channels, even into modern Iranian culture, after their interesting revival in the seventeenth century in the School of Isfahan. It is another important seed of thought that first developed in the Saljuq epoch. T o conclude, the importance of the Saljuq period in the religious history of Iran lies in its formative richness, expressed in various directions of thought: first, Ash'ari Sunnism reached its final systématisation in the great synthesis of Ghazàlî. Secondly, Sùfism was first organized into great brotherhoods, and important schools were created. Thirdly, the philo sophy of Suhravardi Maqtul opened up new paths to Iranian theosophical speculation. And fourthly, Shfi ferment pullulated in Iran in the double aspect of Isma'Ilism, with its highly interesting esoteric theology, and Twelver Imâmism, which, though now comparatively weak, created a wide network of propaganda centres, during the Saljuq period.

CHAPTER 4
DYNASTIC AND POLITICAL HISTORY
OF THE IL-KHANS
THE MONGOL INVASION
The chronology of Sultan Muhammad's first contacts with the Mongols is extremely confusing, and it is difficult and sometimes impossible to reconcile the accounts of the various authorities. According to Juzjani1 relations had been established as early as 1215. Himself attracted by the riches of China and therefore disturbed by reports of Chingiz-Khan's operations in that region Muhammad decided to send an embassy to this new rival with instructions to ascertain his military strength and the extent of his successes. The embassy was headed by one Baha' alDin Razi, and Juzjani professes to give his somewhat lurid account of the mission in the envoy's actual words. As the party journeyed through the North China plain they descried in the far distance a great white mound, which they took to be a snow-covered mountain but which, as they were informed by their guides, was in fact a huge pyramid of human bones. As they proceeded farther the very ground beneath their feet became dark and greasy from the fat of rotting corpses; and for three full stages they had to make their way through this grisly morass. When they finally arrived before Peking they perceived, beneath a bastion of the citadel, the bones of 60,000 young women who, when the city was captured, had flung themselves from the walls rather than fall into the hands of the M o n g o l s . D u r i n g the envoys' first interview with ChingizKhan the Chin Emperor's son and prime minister were brought in bound in chains, no doubt with an eye to the effect of this spectacle upon the ambassadors. The latter were, however, favourably received, and in a second interview Chingiz-Khan charged them to inform the sultan that he regarded him as the ruler of the West, as he himself was ruler of the East. There should be a treaty of peace and friendship between them, and merchants should be free to travel to and fro between their territories. Among the gifts which he sent with them for presenta tion to their master was a nugget of gold from the mountains of China

so large that it had to be transported in a waggon. He dispatched with them also a group of his own merchants with a caravan of five hundred camels laden with gold, silver, silks and furs. And here JuzjanI casts some doubt upon the story by stating, still apparently in the words of Baha' al-Dln, that these were the same merchants whose detention and execution at Utrar gave rise to the outbreak of hostilities between Chingiz-Khan and the sultan. The mission to Peking is mentioned by none of the other sources. However, Nasawi's1 account of an embassy in the opposite direction may well be the description of the same event, viz. the first diplomatic en counter between the Mongols and the Khwarazm-Shah, wherever and whenever this may have actually taken place. The embassy described by Nasawi reached the sultan somewhere in Transoxiana (probably Bukhara) early in 1218 bearing presents similar to those enumerated by JuzjanI, including a precious silk fabric called torqu. T h e message they brought was likewise similar to that recorded by JuzjanI. Chingiz-Khan had heard of the sultan's victories and wished to conclude a treaty of peace and friendship with him; he wished also for the free and un hampered movement of merchants between their territories. In expressing these wishes, however, he referred to Muhammad as being " o n a level with the dearest of my sons", a phrase which gave deep offence to the sultan. Sending for one of the envoys, a Khwarazmi called Mahmud, probably the same Mahmud Yalavach who afterwards held high office in the Mongol empire, he questioned him in private about Chingiz-Khan, asking whether it was true that he had conquered the Chinese and captured their capital. Mahmud replied that it was indeed so. Even such conquests, the sultan went on, did not give an infidel the right to address him, the ruler of a great empire, as his son, i.e. as a vassal. Perceiving the sultan's anger Mahmud added that the Mongols' army could bear no comparison with the Khwarazm-Shah's forces, and Muhammad was mollified and agreed to the conclusion of a treaty.
Whatever the truth about the initial embassy to or from ChingizKhan, the sources are all in broad agreement about the massacre at Utrar. In that town, on Muhammad's eastern frontier, there arrived at some time in 1 2 1 8 a caravan of merchants, four hundred and fifty in number according to Juvaini,2 a figure which tallies with the five hundred camels which, in Juzjanl's account, were required for the transport of

their wares. The sight of all these riches excited the cupidity of the governor, a relation of the sultan called Inalchuq, who had been accorded the title of Qayir-Khan. He placed the whole party under arrest and dispatched a messenger to Muhammad, who according to Juvaini was still in Western Persia, to seek his instructions, alleging that the merchants were really spies in the service of the Mongols. Whether the sultan believed this allegation or whether, like Inalchuq, he was activated solely by motives of greed, he authorized or at any rate connived at the execution of several hundred fellow-Muslims, many of whom must have been his own subjects. News of this bloodbath was brought to Chingiz-Khan by a member of the party who had contrived to make his escape. Controlling his anger the Mongol conqueror made a last attempt to obtain satisfaction by diplomatic means. A Muslim, formerly in the service of Sultan Tekish, was dispatched with two Mongols as companions to protest against Inalchuq's action and demand the surrender of his person. Far from acceding to this request the sultan ordered all three envoys to be put to death, a wanton breach of international law which rendered the Mongols' invasion of his territories inevitable. However, before Chingiz-Khan could attack the sultan it was necessary to deal with two enemies nearer home. Of these the more formidable was the Naiman Kuchliig, who as the sultan's ally had seized the lion's share of the Qara-Khitai empire. An army under the command of the famous Jebe chased him from Kashghar over the Pamirs into Badakhshan, where, with the co-operation of the local population, he was captured and put to death. In the meantime the remnants of the Merkit had been defeated and annihilated by an army jointly commanded by the great general Siibedei and by Chingiz-Khan's eldest son Jochi, Defeated with Kuchliig on the Irtish in 1206 the Merkit had at first made common cause with the Naiman prince but had then quarrelled with him and withdrawn into the region of the Upper Yenisei. Pursued from thence by the M o n g o l s , they had fled to the territory of the Qipchaq to the north-east of the Aral Sea; and here, in what is today the Kustanai region of Northern Kazakhstan, they were now overtaken and destroyed. Sultan Muhammad was in Samarqand when he learnt of the Merkit's approach to the Qipchaq country. He at once set out to attack them, but upon reaching J and received the news that the Mongols were close at their heels. Returning to Samarqand for reinforcements he advanced

northwards for the second time, hoping, in the words of Juvaini,1 " t o kill two birds with one stone". Between two rivers, apparently the Irgiz and the Turgai, he came upon the scene of the battle. From a wounded man, discovered amongst the piles of dead, it was learnt that it had been fought that very day. Hurrying after the retiring Mongols the sultan caught up with them the next morning. They sought to avoid a conflict insisting that their quarrel was only with the Merkit and that they had no authority to attack the sultan. The latter, however, forced them into a stubborn but indecisive engagement, which con tinued till nightfall. The Mongols then withdrew under cover of darkness after first kindling fires to conceal their intention; and the sultan entered their camp the next morning only to find it deserted. H e returned to Samarqand in a state of panic, the effect of this first en counter with the Mongols being such that he never again ventured to meet them in the open field. It was probably at Samarqand that Muhammad first learnt of the approach of Chingiz-Khan's main army. H e held the first of several councils of war, in which his son Jalal al-Din,2 according to Juvaini, or Shihab al-Din Khivaqi, according to Ibn al-Athir,3 advocated the more courageous, if less practical, course of advancing with united forces to meet the enemy at the frontier. The majority were in favour of abandoning Transoxiana to its fate, some advising the sultan to with draw into Khurasan and defend the crossings of the Oxus, while others suggested that he should make a stand in the Ghazna region of Afghanis tan and, if necessary, fall back on India. He decided to follow this latter advice and having placed considerable garrisons in the various towns of Transoxiana made his way to Balkh en route for Ghazna. At Balkh, however, he was met by an emissary of his son Rukn al-Din, the governor of 'Iraq-i 'Ajam, who persuaded him to change his plans and proceed instead to Central Persia. Upon leaving Balkh he sent a patrol to Panjab or Mela, the well-known crossing of the Oxus near the mouth of the Vakhsh, to ascertain the course of events. At Tirmidh the patrol came up with the news that Bukhara had already fallen, soon followed by a report of the capture of Samarqand. Continuing his westward flight the sultan passed by the great natural fortress known later as Kalat-i Nadiri, and it was suggested to him that he should concentrate troops and supplies in this well-nigh impregnable stronghold. He was

THE MONGOL INVASION
unable to reach a decision and pressed onwards towards Nishäpur, where he arrived on 18 April 1220. Still in a state of panic he urged the inhabitants to disperse throughout the countryside rather than attempt to withstand the irresistible Mongols. Finding them unwilling to quit their homes he bade them repair the fortifications for whose destruction he had himself been responsible. Then gradually recovering his peace of mind and thinking that the Oxus might prove at least a temporary barrier to the Mongols' advance, he gave himself up to pleasure and for a time refused to listen to any serious business. His fears were now so much allayed that he decided to send Jalal al-Dln back to Balkh. He had travelled only a single stage of the journey when he learnt that Subedei and Jebe had already crossed the Oxus and were close at hand. He returned to Nishäpur with the news, and the sultan left the town on 15 May just in time to escape the vanguard of the Mongol army, which arrived before the gates on the very next day and at once continued in his pursuit.
The conquest of Transoxiana had been accomplished with incredible speed. After passing the summer of 1219 on the banks of the Irtish Chingiz-Khän had advanced westwards in the autumn through what is now the Soviet Socialist Republic of Kazakhstan. At Qayaliq in the present-day Taldy Kurgan region he was joined by the local Qarluq tribesmen as also by the Qarluq of Almaliq and a contingent of Uighur led by their ruler, the tdhuq-qut. T h e M o n g o l army, which in Barthold's1 estimation numbered between 150,000 and 200,000 men, arrived at some time in the late autumn before the frontier town of Uträr. Here Chingiz-Khän divided his forces, advancing himself on Bukhara with the main body, whilst sending his eldest son Jochi on an expedition down the Syr Darya and leaving his younger sons Chaghatai and Ögedei to lay siege to Uträr. Having crossed the Syr Darya the Mongols approached the small fortified town of Zurnuq, which was persuaded to surrender without a fight. Instead, however, of following the normal route towards Samarqand the Mongols were led by Turkmen guides across the Qizil Qum desert to Nur (now Nurata); and from Nur, which likewise offered no resistance, Chingiz-Khän arrived before Bukhara early in February 1220. The garrison, after a siege of only three days, decided to abandon the town and endeavoured to cut their way through the besiegers; but only a few of their number made good their escape. The townspeople were left with no choice but capitu

lation, and the next day they opened their gates to the Mongols. The citadel, however, was still held by a small body of the sultan's troops who continued to offer resistance. This act of defiance was countered by the M o n g o l s ' destroying the town by fire and then launching an assault on the fortifications driving the inhabitants in front of them as a kind of cannon fodder. After some twelve days' fighting the citadel was stormed and its defenders massacred to a man. The walls of the town were then razed to the ground, and the Mongols, accompanied by a levy of the able-bodied men of Bukhara forced into their service to fight in the front ranks against their fellow Muslims, set out for Samarqand. The fortifications of Samarqand had been greatly strengthened and very considerable forces concentrated there, circum stances of which Chingiz-Khan had been informed at Utrar and which account for his having first attacked the more westerly Bukhara. Arriving before the town he passed the first two days in inspecting the walls and outworks, his forces now augmented by the troops of Chaghatai and Ogedei, the victors of Utrar. It was at this juncture that, having learnt of Muhammad's flight, he dispatched Siibedei and J e b e in his pursuit. On the third and fourth days of the siege the defenders made sorties from the town but with such disastrous effect that on the fifth day they decided to surrender. Having first demolished the walls the Mongols drove the inhabitants out into the open country the better to subject the town to pillage. Here too, as in Bukhara, the citadel garrison fought on after the surrender, but they were soon over powered and destroyed. As for the civil population they were now divided up, the craftsmen for ultimate transportation to Mongolia as slaves of the Mongol princes and the young men for service in the levy; and the conquest of Transoxiana virtually completed, ChingizKhan withdrew into the mountains to the south of the town to remain inactive, resting his men and animals, until the autumn. In the meanwhile Jebe and Siibedei were sweeping across Persia in pursuit of the sultan. So well, however, had he concealed his tracks that only on one occasion did the Mongols come to close quarters with him and even then he was quickly able to shake them off. It will be convenient, therefore, to consider Muhammad's movements separately from those of his pursuers. Upon leaving Nishapur he had made off in a north-westerly direction to Isfara'in and then followed the great trunk road to Ray. At Ray a patrol came up with the news that the enemy was close at hand and he hurried south-westwards to the castle

309
of Farrazln1 near the modern Arak (Sultanabad) on the HamadanIsfahan road, where his son Rukn al-Din was encamped with an army of 30,000 men. Upon the very day of his arrival he sent his mother along with his son Ghiyath al-Din to the castle of Qarun, apparently a mountain stronghold in the neighbourhood of Hamadan, and at the same time dispatched a messenger to summon the atabeg of Great Lur, Nusrat al-Din Hazar-Asp. In the meantime the sultan consulted the amirs of 'Iraq-i cAjam as to the best means of repelling the invaders. They advised that a stand should be made in the bastion provided by the Kuh-i Ushturan, a lofty mountain chain in the High Zagros. He went to inspect these mountains at close range and then damped his troops' spirits by rejecting out of hand the possibility of their defending themselves in such a terrain. N o sooner had he descended from the mountains than the atabeg Nusrat al-Din appeared in answer to his summons. He too offered a natural stronghold as a base of operations: a mountain valley on the border of Luristan and Fars, probably the Shi'b-i Bavvan, famed as one of the four Earthly Paradises. Here, the atabeg said, 100,000 foot could be gathered together from Luristan and Fars to repel the enemy upon his arrival. But the sultan opposed himself to this plan also, suspecting or affecting to suspect that Nusrat al-Din wished to involve him in his own quarrel with the atabeg of Fars. He decided to remain in Farrazin but had no sooner reached this decision than he received news of the Mongols' attack upon Ray; and at the heels of the patrol which brought this news came the Mongols themselves.
They overtook the sultan en route to Qarun and discharged arrows at him without realizing his identity. Escaping on his wounded horse he made his way to the castle, where he remained for only one day before taking guides and stealing off in the direction of Baghdad. The Mongols arrived immediately and launched an assault on the castle thinking the sultan to be still inside it; then realizing their mistake they set off in his pursuit. He shook them off by turning back from the Baghdad road and striking northwards towards the strong castle of Sarchahan in the mountains between Sa'in-Qal'a and Sultaniyeh. He remained here for seven days before crossing the Alburz into Gilan; he then turned eastwards along the coast of the Caspian, the Mongols being now once again in close pursuit. Arriving at Dabu in the Amul area he was advised by the local amirs to seek refuge in one of the offshore islands, apparently the present-day Ashuradeh at the entrance to Astarabad bay.

It was here that he died in December 1220, or January 1221, either, as Juvaini1 would have us believe, from grief at the fate of his womenfolk, who had been captured by the Mongols in a castle on the neighbouring mainland, or, according to Nasawi's2 more prosaic account, from an acute inflammation of the lungs. Such was the wretched end of a monarch who for a brief interval had ruled over the whole eastern half of the Saljuq empire but whose very conquests had facilitated the Mongol invasion, just as his conduct at Utrar had provoked it. As for the sultan's pursuers, they had followed the normal practice of Mongol advance parties, avoiding combat as much as possible and attacking only when provoked. Thus at Balkh, where the notables of the town had sent a deputation to them with offerings of food (tu^gbu), they had contented themselves with setting a shahna or resident over the people and had done them no harm. Even at Zaveh (the modern Turbati-Haidari), where the townspeople had closed their gates and refused their demand for provisions, it was at first their intention to ride o n ; but angered by jeers shouted at them from the walls they had turned back to storm the town and massacre the population. At Nishapur itself the authorities saw fit to g o through the forms of submission and to supply the Mongols' needs. A deputation was received by Jebe, who urged them to destroy their walls and to give provisions to any bodies of troops that passed by. The two generals then parted company, evidently quite uncertain as to the direction of the sultan's flight. Subedei turned back south-eastwards to Jam and then circled round to the north-west through Tus, Radkan and Quchan to Isfara'in. Here he may have picked up the sultan's trail, for he followed in his tracks along the great Khurasan trunk road as far as Ray. Meanwhile Jebe, who had made for the district of Juvain to the north-west of Nishapur, had proceeded from thence into Mazandaran, where he carried out great massacres, especially in the Amul region, before crossing the mountains to link up with Jebe at Ray. What happened at Ray is by no means clear. According to Juvaini,3 the qddi and other dignitaries tendered submission to the Mongols, but Ibn al-Athir speaks of their sacking the town, perhaps as the consequence of a later rebellion.4 At Ray the Mongols learnt of the sultan's recent departure in the direction of Hamadan, and Jebe set out in his pursuit. Entering Hamadan he received the submission of the governor and set a shahna over the town,

to which he returned again after the clash with the sultan at Qarun. From Hamadan he made his way to Sujas to defeat and destroy a large concentration of the sultan's troops under two of his generals. The greater part of cIraq-i 'Ajam was then subjected to slaughter and rapine until, with the approach of winter, the Mongols withdrew northwards to the Mughan Steppe. That troops were sent from these winter quarters in search of the sultan is possible but unlikely; the forces which chased him along the Caspian littoral and which captured the castles in which his harem had sought refuge were probably those left behind by Jebe in the previous summer. In any case, the generals' main attention must have been attracted in another direction, for it was from this base that they launched their first attack on the Georgians, on w h o m they inflicted a crushing defeat in February 1221. In the spring they returned to Hamadan to put down a revolt and then left 'Iraq for Azarbaijan, where they pillaged and slaughtered until the atabeg made his sub mission. It was about this time, according to Rashid al-Dln,1 that they dispatched a message to Chingiz-Khan to the effect that the sultan being now dead they would, in accordance with the khan's yarl'igh, continue their conquests for a year or two before returning to Mongolia by way of the Caucasus. It would seem, indeed, that the pursuit of the sultan had been only the first part of their mission. F r o m Azarbaijan the generals now invaded Georgia for the second time, then passing into Shirvan forced their way through Darband to descend into the plains of what is now southern Russia. Here they dispersed a coalition of Caucasians and Qipchaq before advancing westwards into the Crimea to sack the Genoese entrepot of Soldaia and defeat a Russian army on the Kalka. Then they turned back, crossing the Volga near the present-day Volgograd and finally joining their master somewhere along the route of his homeward journey after carrying out a reconnaissance raid without parallel in history, " a n expedition", in the words of Gibbon,2 " which had never been attempted and has never been repeated".
In the summer of 1220, whilst Jebe and Siibedei were chasing Sultan Muhammad to and fro across Persia, Chingiz-Khan was resting his men and animals in the mountains to the south of Samarqand. It was not until the autumn that he moved southwards against Tirmidh on the northern bank of the Oxus, where today it forms the frontier between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. The people of Tirmidh, emboldened by the strength of their fortifications, rejected his call to surrender, and

HISTORY OF THE IL-KHANS
paid for their defiance the terrible price that was soon to be exacted from the great cities of Khurasan. When after eleven days' fighting the town was taken by storm, the whole population, men and women, were driven out on to the plain, and divided amongst the soldiers, by whom they were then put to death, each soldier being responsible for the execution of a fixed number of persons. T h e story is told that when the Mongols had finished this butchery they caught a woman who had escaped their attention. In exchange for her life she offered them a large pearl but, when they asked to see it, said that she had swallowed it. They at once disembowelled her and found several pearls in her stomach, whereupon Chingiz-Khan ordered all the bodies to be eviscerated. From Tirmidh he now withdrew into the upper reaches of the Vakhsh, i.e. the region of the present-day Tajikistan, where he passed the winter of 1220-1 in operations against the local population. Then, with the approach of spring, he prepared to cross the Oxus and attack Balkh. On what happened at Balkh the authorities disagree. Ibn al-Athir1 says that the town surrendered voluntarily and that in consequence the lives of the inhabitants were spared. On the other hand, according to Juvaini,2 the population, despite their professions of submission, was subjected to the same wholesale slaughter as the people of Tirmidh. It is probable that, as appears to have been the case at Ray and as we know to have been the case at Herat, the massacre followed, not upon the original surrender of the town, but upon a subsequent revolt. Whatever the details, the capitulation of Balkh was speedily achieved, and Chingiz-Khan turned westwards to lay siege to Taliqan, a town in the mountains of Juzjan, probably to be identified with the present-day Chachaktu. The town with its castle (which is given various names, all meaning something like " Hill of Victory ") occupied a strategic position in the path of bodies of Mongol troops on their way to Khurasan, Ghur and southern Afghanistan; and whenever such parties passed beneath the castle the garrison would make a sortie and attack them, carrying off their prisoners and cattle. So seriously did this harassment affect the Mongols' movements that, some months before ChingizKhan's arrival a large force from the main army had been beleaguering the town. Their failure to capture Taliqan accounts for Chingiz-Khan's decision to intervene in person. The subjugation of Khurasan he deputed to his youngest son Tolui, who carried out the task with a thoroughness from which that region has never recovered.

From Balkh, Tolui proceeded in a westerly direction as far as Maruchaq in what is now the north-western corner of Afghanistan. Then crossing the Murghab and its left-bank affluent the Kushk he turned northwards along the river bank, following what, six centuries later, were to be the tracks of the Transcaspian Railway. Marv, at the time of his approach, was in a state of great confusion, the governor being at loggerheads with a great host of Turkmen who had sought refuge in that neighbourhood and whom he had only recently succeeded in dislodging from the town, which they still continued to attack. Having spied out the position of the Turkmen's encampment on the river bank, the Mongols launched a night attack. Surprised in the darkness the Turkmen, despite their numbers, were utterly routed, and such as were not drowned in the river fled in panic. T h e way now lay open and on the next day, 25 February 1221, the M o n g o l s arrived before the gates of Marv. Tolui in person, with an escort of five hundred horsemen, rode the whole distance around the walls, and for six days the Mongols continued to inspect the defences, reaching the conclusion that they were in good repair and would withstand a lengthy siege. On the seventh day the Mongols launched a general assault. The towns people made two sallies from different gates, being in both cases at once driven back by the Mongol forces. They seem then to have lost all will to resist. The next day the governor surrendered the town, having been reassured by promises that were not in fact to be kept. The whole population was now driven out into the open country, and for four days and nights the people continued to pour out of the town. Four hundred artisans and a number of children were selected to be carried off as slaves, and it was commanded that the whole of the remaining popu lation, men, women, children, should be put to the sword. They were distributed, for this purpose, amongst the troops, and to each individual soldier was allotted the execution of three to four hundred persons. These troops included levies from the captured towns, and Juvaini records that the people of Sarakhs, who had a feud with the people of Marv, exceeded the ferocity of the heathen Mongols in the slaughter of their fellow-Muslims. Even now the ordeal of Marv was not yet over. When the Mongols withdrew those who had escaped death by concealing themselves in holes and cavities emerged from their hiding places. They amounted in all to some five thousand people. A detachment of M o n g o l s , part of the rearguard, now arrived before the town. Wishing to have their share

of the slaughter they called upon these unfortunate wretches to come out into the open country, each carrying a skirtful of grain. And having them thus at their mercy they massacred these last feeble remnants of one of the greatest cities of Islam. The sober and careful Ibn al-Athir,1 a contemporary of these events, puts the number of the slain at the enormous figure of 700,000. J u v a i n i 2 gives an even higher figure. H e tells how the sayyid 'Izz al-Dln Nassaba " together with some other persons passed thirteen days and nights in counting the people slain within the town. Taking into account only those that were plain to see and leaving aside those that had been killed in holes and cavities and in the villages and deserts, they arrived at a figure of more than one million, three hundred thousand." From this great shambles Tolui now proceeded south-westwards to Nishapur. After their desertion by Sultan Muhammad the people of Nishapur had at first adopted a conciliatory attitude towards the Mongols, but with the passage of time and the rumours of victories gained by the sultan in Central Persia they had become openly hostile to the invaders. In November 1220 an army of 10,000 men under one Toghachar, a son-in-law of Chingiz-Khan, had appeared before the town. T h e fierce resistance of the townsfolk caused the M o n g o l s to withdraw but not before Toghachar had been killed in battle. The people of Nishapur were elated with the news of his death, which was, how ever, soon to prove their own death-warrant. Tolui now approached the town with such vast forces and such abundance of siege instruments that the people at once lost heart and sought to negotiate terms of surrender. Their overtures were rejected, and the assault began on Wednesday, 7 April 1221: the walls were breached on the Friday, and on the Saturday the town was taken by storm. As in Marv, the people were driven out into the open country, and in order to avenge the death of Toghachar it was ordered " that the town should be laid waste that the site could be ploughed upon; and that in the exaction of vengeance not even cats and dogs should be left alive".3 Toghachar's widow, the daughter of Chingiz-Khan, rode into the town with her escort and took her share in the killing of the survivors. Four hundred craftsmen were spared for transportation to Mongolia; otherwise the

whole population was put to death. The heads of the slain were severed from their bodies and piled in heaps, those of the men being separate from those of the women and children. " T h e last of all to suffer", says Juvaini,1 " w a s Herat, and when he [i.e. Tolui] had joined her to her sisters, he returned to wait upon his father." The Persian historian has unfortunately left no detailed account of the capture of the town. Barthold,2 on the authority of d'Ohsson, whose authority in turn was a fifteenth-century local history of Herat, says that none of the inhabitants were killed, with the exception of the sultan's troops and that Herat, in consequence, " suffered least of all". On the other hand, Juzjani, a contemporary of the event who had himself taken part in the defence of a mountain fortress at no great distance from Herat, speaks of its capture after siege of eight months' duration and the subsequent massacre of the entire population. There were in fact two sieges of Herat, both of which are recorded in detail in a work which was re-discovered only during the present century and was published, on the basis of a unique manuscript, as recently as 1944. This is the Ta9rikh-Ndma-yi~Hardt or " H i s t o r y of H e r a t " of Saif b. Muhammad b. Ya'qub known as Saifi. A native of Herat, Saifi was born in that city in 1282 and wrote his history at some time between 1318 and 1322. It contains a great deal of information, not recorded elsewhere, about conditions not only in Herat itself but in the whole of Khurasan in the period during and immediately following the Mongol invasion.
According to Saifl's3 account Tolui, upon his arrival before Herat, encamped in the meadows near the town and sent an envoy to invite the people to surrender. The envoy was at once put to death on the orders of the malik or governor representing Sultan Jalal al-Dln. Tolui, in anger, ordered a general assault, which continued for eight days, at the end of which the malik was killed in the fighting. Tolui now inter vened in person, riding up to the edge of the moat and making a proclamation, in which he promised to spare the lives of the inhabitants if they surrendered immediately. T o this the townspeople agreed and the Mongols kept their word except with regard to the troops of Sultan Jalal al-Dln numbering 12,000 men. Tolui set a malik over the town, a Muslim called Abu Bakr of Maruchaq, and also a Mongol shahna, a man called Mengetei, a member of Tolui's immediate entourage. Eight days later Tolui left the region to join his father.

But this was by no means the end of the story. For a time all went well, the people living peaceably under the protection of the Muslim malik and the Mongol shahna. And then, all of a sudden, they rose in rebellion and killed both of these officials. Saifi gives two versions of this rising. It was either a spontaneous movement on the part of the Heratis or else it was engineered by the people of the mountain stronghold of Kalyun to the north-east of Herat, who were still holding out against the Mongols, and hoped in this way to enlist the Heratis as their allies. According to this latter version, the assassinations were carried out by men from Kalyun who entered the town disguised as merchants with weapons concealed about their persons. Whatever the truth of the matter, the damage was now done. When the news reached ChingizK h a n he was filled with anger and dispatched the general Eljigidei at the head of 80,000 men to mete out retribution. Saifi1 records his instructions: " T h e dead have come to life again. This time you must cut the people's heads off: you must execute the whole population of Herat/'
Eljigidei set out in November 1221. In due course he arrived on the Hari Rud, and busied himself for the next month with warlike prepara tions : from the surrounding regions he gathered reinforcements to the strength of 50,000 men. With this great army Eljigidei now laid siege to Herat. This time the resistance was long and heroic. It was not until J u n e of the following year that the M o n g o l s finally captured the town. Eljigidei carried out his instructions to the letter: the entire population was put to death, " a n d no head was left on a body, nor body with a head".2 Saifi assesses the number of those thus massacred at a figure of 1,600,000. (The contemporary Juzjani3 records that in a single quarter there were counted 600,000 dead and on this basis estimates the total number in the whole town at 2,400,000!) For seven days the Mongols were busy with this slaughter and with demolishing the houses, filling in the moats and destroying the fortifications. O n the eighth day they set off in the direction of Kalyun. When they had reached Auba (Obeh) on the Hari Rud, Eljigidei sent back 2,000 horse men with instructions to kill any persons they might find w h o had escaped the massacre by going into hiding. They stayed two days in the town, where they discovered nearly their own number of such wretches; they put them all to death and then returned to the main body.

THE MONGOL INVASION
The siege of Ţăliqân, to which we now return, lasted, according to Ibn al-Aţhir,1 ten months (six months before, and four months after the personal intervention of Chingiz-Khân), according to Rashid alDin,2 seven months; the town was taken only after the arrival of Tolui's forces fresh from the conquest of Khurasan, i.e. at some time in the early summer of 1221. On Chingiz-Khân's movements following on the capture of Ţăliqân the sources are vague and contradictory. He probably remained in the mountains of Juzjăn in the immediate vicinity of Ţăliqân until he received the news of Sultan Jalăl al-Dîn's victory at Parvăn. Jalăl al-Dln had accompanied his father in his flight across Persia and had been present at his deathbed on the island in the Caspian. Together with his brothers Uzlaq-Sulţăn, the heir-presumptive of Sultan Muham mad (though, according to Nasawi, the sultan, shortly before his death, had altered his will in favour of Jalăl al-Din) and Aq-Sulţăn he then left the island and landing on the Manqishlaq Peninsula made for Gurgănj, his father's capital, which he reached some little time before its investment by the Mongols. The discovery of a plot against his life (in which his brother Uzlaq-Sultan seems to have been involved) prompted him to quit the capital almost immediately and make for the territories formerly allotted to him by his father and corresponding more or less to the modern Afghanistan. Crossing the Qara Qum desert accompanied by only three hundred horse he broke through the cordon established by the Mongols along the northern frontiers of Khurasan and succeeded in reaching Nişhăpur. His brothers, Uzlaq-Sultan and Aq-Sulţăn, who followed the same route shortly afterwards, were less fortunate. They were killed in battle or captured in flight and their severed heads were paraded on the end of lances to strike terror into the population—an indignity afterwards inflicted upon Duke Henry of Silesia.3 As for Jalăl al-Din, he remained in Nişhăpur only for a day or two before departing, on 10 February 1221, en route for Ghazna. His departure nearly coincided with the arrival of the Mongols in his pursuit. They at once took up the chase, but he shook them off and travelling, according to Juvaini,4 150 miles in a single day arrived before the walls of Zuzan in Kuhistăn. Refused asylum by the people of Zuzan he found shelter in a neighbouring town, which he left at

midnight, only a few hours before the arrival of the Mongols: he had reached the region of Herat before they finally abandoned their pursuit. The sultan continued on his way to Ghazna, which, at the time of his arrival, was in the hands either of his cousin Amin Malik, a Qanqli Turk, who had been malik of Herat, or of the Ghuri A'zam Malik, the son of 'Imad al-Din of Balkh, more probably the latter. Amin Malik, if not already present, hastened to join the sultan and with his Qanqli forces, the Ghuri troops of A'zam Malik and a great host of Khalaj and Turkmen tribesmen which had gathered together at Peshawar under Saif al-Din Ighraq, Jalal al-Din now found himself at the head of a well-equipped, if ill-assorted, army of some 60,000 men. The sultan passed the remainder of the winter in Ghazna and in the first days of spring led his forces northwards to Parvan, a town at the confluence of the Ghorband and the Pan)shir in a position where many roads met and where he hoped to obtain some information about the course of events. Learning that a Mongol army under the two generals Tekechuk and Molghor was laying siege to a castle in the Walian Kotal (to the north-west of Charikar) he led an attack against them and had killed a thousand men of the Mongol vanguard before they with drew across the river (apparently the Ghorband) and destroyed the bridge. The two armies then discharged arrows at each other across the water until nightfall, when the Mongols retreated and the sultan returned to his base at Parvan. News of this encounter being brought to Chingiz-Khan, presumably by the defeated commanders, he at once dispatched one of his most distinguished commanders, the Tatar Shigi-Qutuqu, at the head of an army of 30,000 men. The Mongols reached Parvan, according to Juvaini,1 only a week after the sultan's own arrival. Jalal al-Din at once rode out to meet the enemy. Three miles from the town he drew up his forces in battle order, assigning the right wing to Amin Malik and the left to Ighraq, while he himself commanded in the centre. He then instructed the whole army to dismount and fight on foot holding on to the reins of their horses. T h e Mongols concentrated their attack on the right wing under Amin Malik, which they drove back until repeated reinforcements from the centre and the right turned the tide and they were forced back in turn. The battle raged to and fro until nightfall when both sides withdrew to their bases. Under cover of darkness the Mongols had recourse to a ruse which, according to Carpini,2was part of their normal tactics. They

set up dummy warriors on their spare horses, and the next morning the sultan's army were dismayed to descry what appeared to be a line of reinforcements drawn up at the rear of the enemy lines. In their alarm they considered the possibility of flight but, rallied by the sultan, joined battle with the Mongols for the second time. Again they fought on foot and this time the enemy launched their attack on the left wing under Ighraq. Ighraq's men stood firm and the M o n g o l s turned and began to make for their base, whereupon, at the sultan's command, the whole army mounted horse and moved forward at the charge. The Mongols fled before them, then turned in a final desperate attack before, with the sultan's personal intervention, they were utterly routed, Shigi-Qutuqu escaping with the remnants of his army to carry the news to ChingizKhan. Few victories have been more short-lived than this, the only serious defeat to be inflicted upon the Mongols during the whole campaign. Jalal al-Dln's forces were dispersed upon the very battle-field. In a quarrel over the booty Amin Malik struck Ighraq over the head with a whip. Jalal al-Din, fearing the reaction of Amin Malik's undisciplined followers, saw fit to ignore the incident, and Ighraq, waiting only till nightfall, withdrew in dudgeon with all his forces as also those of A'zam Malik, who had taken his side in the dispute with the Qanqli. Disheartened by their defection, Jalal al-Din returned to Ghazna, there to make preparations for seeking safety beyond the Indus: the victor of Parvan was soon to become a fugitive before the main army of Chingiz-Khan. At Taliqan Chingiz-Khan had been joined not only by Tolui but also by his elder sons Chaghatai and Ogedei, who together with his eldest son Jochi had captured the Khwarazmi capital Gurganj after a siege of seven months. It was thus at the head of vastly augmented forces that he now advanced against Jalal al-Din, apparently setting out from the Taliqan area immediately upon receiving the news of the defeat inflicted upon Tekechiik and Molghor. His route lay through the present-day district of Durzab and Gurziwan, where the resistance of a stronghold (prob ably the castle of Rang mentioned by Juzjani)1 delayed the army, according to Juvaini,2 for a full month. The advance was held up at Bamiyan also, where one of Chaghatai's sons, the favourite grandchild of Chingiz-Khan, was killed and where, in vengeance for his death, it was ordered " that every living creature, from mankind down to the

brute beasts, should be killed; that no prisoner should be taken; that not even the child in its mother's womb should be spared; and that henceforth no living creature should live therein".1 The report of Şhigi-Qutuqu's defeat at Parvân seems to have reached Chingiz-Khân after this butchery had been completed, for we are told by Juvaini that upon receiving the news he hurried forward by day and night without intermission so that no time was left for the cooking of food. At Parvân he halted long enough to inspect the battlefield and to criticize both his own commanders and the sultan for their choice of positions. In Ghazna, which he entered without opposition, he learnt that Jalal al-Din had left for the Indus only a fortnight before and at once continued in his pursuit. He overtook the sultan on the very banks of the river, probably at Dinkot, near the modern Kâlâbăgh, whilst the boats were still being assembled for the crossing. Despite his desperate position, hemmed in by the oncoming Mongols in front and with the waters of the Indus in his rear, Jalăl al-Din drew up his forces and offered battle. The Mongols first attacked the right wing commanded by Amin Malik; it was driven back and destroyed, Amin Malik himself being killed whilst fleeing in the direction of Peshawar. The left wing was likewise driven back: only the centre, where the sultan in person commanded a body of 700 men, continued to stand firm. In charge after charge he attacked different sectors of the semi-circle of troops in front of him, but as more and more detachments arrived he was left with less and less space to manoeuvre until by mid-day it was clear that the situation was hope less. H e mounted a fresh horse, made a final charge to force back the men closing in on him, then turning in the space thus gained he threw off his cuirass and drove his horse over the bank into the water, thirty feet below. His pursuers were about to plunge in after him but were prevented by Chingiz-Khan, who had ridden down to the water's edge to watch the sultan's progress towardst he opposite bank. As he climbed ashore safe and sound, still grasping his sword, lance and shield, the Conqueror pointed him out to his sons with expressions of amaze ment and admiration. Jalal al-Dln's men were less fortunate than their leader: of those that followed him into the Indus the vast majority were killed by Mongol arrows, and Juvaini2 tells us, on the authority of eye witnesses, that the whole river, within the range of the bowmen, was red with the blood of the slain.
The Battle of the Indus marks the virtual end of the Campaign in the

West. It took place, according to Juvaini,1 in Rajab of the year 618, i.e. at some time between 21 August and 19 September 1221. Nasawi2 gives a later and more precise date, viz. the 8th Shawwal (25 November), which is, however, difficult to reconcile with Juvaini's more detailed account of events leading up to the battle. After gaining this victory Chingiz-Khan followed the Indus some distance upstream, apparently seeking a crossing-place and then turned off into the valley of the Upper Kurram. Here he learnt that Jalal al-Dln had recrossed the river to bury his dead. He dispatched Chaghatai in his pursuit whilst pro ceeding himself with the main army to winter-quarters in a region probably to be identified with the Swat valley. He now conceived the idea of returning to Mongolia by way of Bengal and Assam, but the difficulties of the route were such that he was forced to turn back after travelling only two or three stages and slowly retraced his steps through Afghanistan. The summer of 1222 he spent in pasture lands high in the Hindu Kush, apparently in the region of Parvan. Here he received the first visit of the Taoist monk Ch'ang-ch'un, w h o m he had summoned from China hoping to receive from him the " medicine of immortality". A second interview was postponed till the autumn because of news of an insurrection by the " native mountain bandits " 3 with which Chingiz-Khan wished to deal in person. This is perhaps a reference to the continued resistance of Herat or, conceivably, to the situation at Balkh, where, as Juvaini4 tells us, the Mongols on their return journey killed the survivors of the earlier massacre and demolished any walls that were still left standing. Ch'ang-ch'un passed close to Balkh on his way to the second interview with Chingiz-Khan, and we are told in the account of his travels that the population "had recently rebelled against the Khan and had been removed; but we could still hear dogs barking in the streets ".5 Chingiz-Khan received this visit somewhere to the east of Balkh, perhaps in the Baghlai* area; he broke camp on 3 October and crossed the Oxus on a bridge of boats on the 6th. Chaghatai had by now returned from his fruitless search for Sultan Jalal al-Dln, and a general called Dorbei Doqshin was sent back on the same errand. He was equally unsuccessful although he penetrated as far as Multan and Lahore before the summer heat forced him to withdraw northwards to join his master. Meanwhile Chingiz-Khan had reached the Samarqand area

early in November and encamped some six or seven miles to the east of the town. Juvaini is wrong in stating that he passed the whole winter here, for Ch'ang-ch'un, who left Samarqand on 29 December, caught up with the Mongols a month later on the eastern banks of the Syr Darya. The spring and summer of 1223 were spent in the region of QulanBaşhi, the pass between the Aris and Talas basins on the way from Chimkent to Jambul. Here Chcang-chcun took his leave of Chingiz-Khan and we have no precise details regarding the rest of his itinerary: he was on the Black Irtish in the summer of 1224, and it was not till the spring of 1225 that he finally reached his headquarters in Mongolia. In the autumn of the following year he was at war with the Tangut, whose rebellion is said to have been one of the reasons for his return from the West. H e died, while the campaign was still in progress, on 25 A u g u s t 1227.1
SULTÂN JALÂL AL-DÎN
Sultân Jalâl al-Dln remained in India for nearly three years. He was joined, on the very banks of the Indus, by a number of stragglers from his defeated army and after several successful encounters with bodies of Indian troops in the Salt Range found himself at the head of some three to four thousand men. News of the approach of a Mongol army now caused him to withdraw in the direction of Delhi. Somewhere in the Rawalpindi area the Mongols gave up the chase and the sultan, having arrived within two or three days' journey from Delhi, dispatched an envoy to Sultân Shams al-Dln El-Tutmişh to seek an alliance and ask for temporary asylum. Alarmed at the possibility of involvement in the sultan's fortunes El-Tutmişh replied with a polite refusal, and Jalâl al-Dln turned back to the Lahore region, where more fugitives gathered around him and his forces were increased to a total of 10,000 men. Another expedition against the tribes of the Salt Range led to an alliance with the Khokars against Naşir al-Din Qubacha, the ruler of Sind, who was driven out of Uch and forced to flee upstream to Multân. The summer (apparently of 1222) Jalâl al-Din passed in the Salt Range or in the mountains near Lahore and then, with news of the Mongols again in his pursuit, he made his way into Lower Sind, clashing briefly with Qubacha as he passed by Multân, setting fire to Uch, which had risen in revolt, and capturing Sâdüsân (the modern Sehwan) before arriving at the seaport of Debul at the mouth of the

Indus. At Debul he received the news that his brother Ghiyath al-Din had made himself master of 'Iraq, where, however, the greater part of the military favoured Jalal al-Din and were demanding his presence there. This news and reports of the Mongols' continuing approach decided the sultan to re-enter Persia by way of Baluchistan and Makran. The sultan emerged from these waterless wastes with greatly depleted forces: his army, according to Nasawi,1 had been reduced to 4,000 men mounted on donkeys and oxen. He was welcomed on the borders of Kirman by a former official of his father. This was Baraq Hajib, a Qara-Khitayan by origin, who had risen to the rank of hdjib or chamberlain in the service of Sultan Muhammad and had then attached himself to Ghiyath al-Din. Appointed governor of Isfahan he had quarrelled with Ghiyath al-Dln's vizier and was on his way to India to join Jalal al-Din when his party was attacked by the governor of the castle of Guvashir (as the town, as distinct from the province, of Kirman was then known). Baraq turned the tables on his attacker, whom he captured and put to death: the governor's son, driven from the castle, entrenched himself in the inner town, to which Baraq was laying siege when he received the news of the sultan's approach. In addition to other tokens of his loyalty he offered Jalal al-Din the hand of his daughter in marriage. The sultan, as we shall see, was much addicted to such political and, for the most part, temporary alliances: in Ghazna he had married a daughter of the ill-fated Amin Malik and in India a Khokar princess. The marriage with Baraq's daughter having been duly solemnized the sultan appeared before the gates of Guvashir, which at once surrendered to him and in which he now installed himself with his bride and his father-in-law. Some days later he set out on a hunting expedition, from which Baraq excused himself on the grounds of some bodily infirmity. Suspecting his motives Jalal al-Din sent back an officer to summon him to his presence, making out that he was leaving immedi ately for 'Iraq and wished to consult Baraq on conditions in that province. Baraq's reply, though expressed in courtly language, made it quite plain that he intended to keep Kirman for himself, an intention made even plainer by his ejecting such of the sultan's followers as still remained in Guvashir. Jalal al-Din had no alternative but to swallow his dis comfiture and continue on his way, leaving Baraq to consolidate his position and found the local dynasty of the Qutlugh-Khans ( 1 2 2 4 1303). In Fars the sultan fared better. Pleased with the advent of a rival

to Ghiyath al-Din, who had twice invaded his territory, the Atabeg Sa'd showered presents upon Jalal al-Din, gave him his daughter in marriage and even agreed to the sultan's request for the release from imprisonment of his rebellious son Abu Bakr, afterwards his successor and the patron of the poet Sa'di. Jalal al-Din remained in Shiraz only for a month or two after the marriage (perhaps the most permanent of these alliances, for we know that the Salghurid princess accompanied Jalal al-Din in the final flight before the M o n g o l s that culminated in his death at the hands of a Kurdish assassin), and then made his way to Isfahan. Here he learnt of Ghiyath al-Din's presence at Ray, whither he proceeded at such speed as to catch his brother and his followers completely unawares. Most of the officers and officials at once declared themselves for Jalal al-Din, and those who, with Ghiyath al-Din at their head, had fled in panic, were soon persuaded to return and tender their submission. Thus, after three years of wandering, the sultan found himself in undisputed possession of part at least of his father's empire. With the military resources now at his command Jalal al-Din, in the winter of 1224-5, moved southwards into Khuzistan with the object, apparently, of resuming his father's feud with the caliph. Nasawi1 and Juvaini2 are, as one would expect, somewhat reticent on this delicate subject and it is only Ibn al-Athir3 who gives a detailed account of the campaign. In Muharram 622/January-February 1225 the sultan invested Shustar, which was defended with considerable vigour by the caliphal governor of Khuzistan, Muzaffar al-Din Wajh al-Sabu'. As the siege dragged on detachments of the sultan's army infiltrated west wards plundering the country as they went; they reached the districts of Baduraya and Bakusaya on the eastern borders of Arab 'Iraq, and one party turned southwards to clash with the governor (sbahnd) of Basra. Meanwhile the siege of Shustar, which had continued for two months, was suddenly abandoned, and the sultan set out in the direction of Baghdad. His advance was opposed by an army of 20,000 men under the command of the mamluk J a m a l al-Din Qush-Temiir. Defeated by a ruse, despite their superior numbers, the caliph's troops were driven back to the outskirts of Baghdad, which, however, the sultan did not closely approach, perhaps because of the formidable preparations that had been made for his reception, making instead for the small town of

From here the Khwarazmis proceeded to Daquqa (the modern Tauk), still pillaging the countryside as they passed by and in particular seizing all the horses and mules on which they could lay their hands; for they had arrived in Khuzistan, according to Ibn al-Athir, with a great shortage of mounts, such animals as they had being so weak as to be practically useless. Daquqa was taken by storm and the sultan, angered by the inhabitants' resistance, ordered or countenanced a general massacre. Alarmed by the fate of Daquqa the people of Baqazij on the Lower Zab asked the sultan for a shahna to protect them from his soldiers; he sent them, so it was said, a son of Chingiz-Khan whom he had captured in one of his battles with the Mongols. The sultan himself remained in Daquqa till the end of Rabf I (the beginning of May 1225), exchanging messages with Muzaffar al-Dln Kok-Bori, the last (1190-1232) of the Begtiginids of Irbil, with w h o m he finally concluded a treaty of peace. According to Juvaini,1 these negotiations followed upon the capture of Muzaffar al-Dln in battle as he passed by Daquqa at the head of reinforcements for the caliph's army. Satisfied with this diplomatic victory or perhaps realizing that his resources were still inadequate for a full-scale assault on Baghdad, the sultan now decided to turn his arms against a far less formidable opponent, Muzaffar al-Dln Oz-Beg, the atabeg of Azarbaijan.
At Maragheh, which he found still in ruins as the result of the Mongol invasion, Jalal al-Dln received the news that Yaghan Taisi, the maternal uncle and atabeg of his brother Ghiyath al-Dln, had set out from Azarbaijan with the intention of seizing the town and region of Hamadan. After his nephew's discomfiture at Ray, Yaghan Taisi' had entered Oz-Beg's territory either as his ally against the sultan, as Nasawi2 would have us believe, or more probably, as Ibn al-Athir's3 more detailed account implies, as a freebooter pure and simple. After ravaging a great area of Azarbaijan he passed the winter of 1224-5 o n the seacoast of Arran, presumably in the Mughan Steppe, so favoured in later times by the Il-Khans. Recrossing Azarbaijan en route for Hamadan he had pillaged the unhappy country for a second time. His advance on Hamadan was due to the instigation of the caliph, who had offered him the town and region as an iqtd\ presumably as an act of reprisal for the sultan's invasion of his own territory.

speed that was to become proverbial Jalal al-Din came upon Yaghan Taisi by night, his encampment surrounded with the horses, mules, donkeys, oxen and sheep which he had carried off from Arran and Azarbaijan. T h e plunderer awoke in the morning to find his forces encircled by an army whose commander he recognized, by the parasol held over his head, as Sultan Jalal al-Din. Completely taken aback by the sudden appearance of the sultan, whom he had believed to be still in Daquqa, he sent his wife, who was Jalal al-Dln's sister, to intercede on his behalf. She obtained his pardon, and the sultan, his forces swollen by Yaghan Taisi's army to some 50,000 horse, returned to Maragheh to prepare for the attack on Tabriz. With the approach of the sultan the atabeg had at once deserted his capital for Ganja (the present-day Kirovabad) in Arran; and, perhaps because of his enemy's departure, Jalal al-Din's first moves were peaceful and conciliatory enough. He sought and obtained permission for his troops to visit the town and purchase provisions; then when complaints were made about their behaviour, he sent in a shahna to keep order and protect the populace; only when complaints were lodged against the shahna did he finally lay siege to the town. After five days of violent fighting the two sides came to terms, and Tabriz was surrendered to the sultan on the understanding that Oz-Beg's wife, who had remained in the town, should be granted safe-conduct to her possessions in Khuy and Nakhchivan. This lady, a daughter of Toghril II, the last of the Saljuqs of Iraq, had, according to Juvaini,1 been in secret correspondence with Jalal al-Din. Estranged from her cowardly and pleasure-loving husband, she had promised to secure the capitulation of the town if the sultan would agree to marry her. Such a marriage was possible because of an oath which Oz-Beg had taken that he would divorce her if he executed a slave, whom he now had in fact executed. Jalal al-Din accepted her proposal; she for her part persuaded the notables of Tabriz to negotiate the terms of surrender, and the sultan made his triumphal entry on 17 Rajab 622/ 25 July 1225. Ibn al-Athir2 has recorded two episodes of his short stay in the town. When Friday came around he attended the service at the mosque, but when the preacher began to pray for the caliph he stood up and remained standing until the prayer was over. Oz-Beg had built at vast expense a beautiful pavilion looking down upon gardens. Having entered and inspected it the sultan declared that it was a place fit only

for the slothful and of no use to him. Sloth was certainly not one of Jalal al-Din's failings. Within days, it would seem, of his occupation of Tabriz he had already embarked upon his first campaign against the Georgians. For some years previous to the sultan's arrival the Georgians had been engaged in aggressive warfare against the Muslim states on the southern fringes of the Caucasus; and Azarbaljan, whose ruler had neither the power nor the will to oppose them, had borne the brunt of their attack. Jalal al-Dln was accordingly seen in the light of a heaven sent deliverer, a role which he was only too willing to assume. With such forces as he had at hand he at once advanced into enemy territory, encountering a Georgian army of some 70,000 men on the river Garni in Armenia. The battle, which took place at some time in Sha'ban, 622/August-September 1225, resulted in a crushing defeat for the Georgians; and advancing from the battlefield the sultan captured the old Armenian capital of Dvin, then in Georgian hands. From Dvin he returned to Tabriz, where the leading men were reported—falsely, according to Nasawi1—to be plotting against him, leaving his brother Ghiyath al-Din to carry the war into the borderlands of Eastern Georgia. The conspirators, if such they were, having been duly punished, the sultan left Tabriz for Khuy, where he fulfilled his promise of marrying Oz-Beg's wife. According to Nasawi2 and Juvaini,3 the news was brought to her husband in the castle of Alinja near Julfa, at no great distance from Khuy, and his feelings of shame and mortifi cation were so violent as to bring about his death. It is probable, however, and more in keeping with what is recorded of Oz-Beg's character, that he survived this blow to his personal honour. At any rate we are told by Ibn Al-Athir4 that he was still in Ganja some time after the ceremony when the town was occupied by Jalal al-Din's troops. He withdrew into the castle, from which he sent a message to the sultan protesting against, not the violation of his marriage, but the marauding activities of Jalal al-Din's soldiers; and the sultan dispatched a body of troops to protect him from further annoyance. The war against the Georgians was resumed, according to Nasawi,5 immediately after the 'id al-fitr, i.e. at the beginning of October 1225, but it is difficult to believe that all that had happened since the capture

of Tabriz (at the end of July) could have been crowded into so brief a space of time; and it was probably well into winter (Dhu'l-Hijja, 622 = 4 December 1225-1 January 1226, according to Ibn al-Athir)1 before the sultan re-entered Georgian territory, his objective being now the capital, Tiflis. Advancing directly northwards from Dvin he crossed the Pambak mountains to encounter the enemy in the Lori steppe in what is now northern Soviet Armenia. The Georgian army, according to Ibn al-Athir, had been augmented with contingents of Alans (Ossetes), Lezghians and Qipchaq Turks; but this is probably an anachronistic reference to the confederacy that was formed against the sultan in 1228. Whatever their composition, these forces were defeated, and the sultan advanced into Georgia proper. His progress was slow, whether because of Georgian resistance or because of the rigours of a Caucasian winter, and it was not until the beginning of March 1226 that he finally arrived before Tiflis. Having inspected the fortifications and convinced himself that an open assault would be fruitless Jalal al-Din had recourse to a stratagem. Concealing the greater part of his forces in ambush he approached the town at the head of some 3,000 horse; and the defenders, deceived by appearances, were tempted to make a sortie. T h e sultan turned in simulated flight and led the Georgians on until they fell into the trap he had set, and the whole Khwarazmi army sprang up from their hiding places, drove the enemy back through the gates and, with the collaboration of the Muslim inhabitants, possessed themselves of the town. The citadel, which lay on the far side of the Kur, seemed secure from attack; but a single day sufficed for the sultan to transport his troops across the river and blockade it from every side. The garrison negotiated favourable terms of surrender and were allowed to withdraw unmolested into western Georgia. It was otherwise with the townspeople. The Christian population, except such as saved their lives by apostasy, were subjected to a general massacre; and all of their churches were razed to the ground.
Jalal al-Din's prestige was now perhaps at its zenith. Tiflis had been in Georgian hands for more than a century and in recovering the city for Islam the sultan had succeeded with apparent ease where the Saljuqs, while still at the height of their power, had repeatedly failed. It was this success no doubt which induced his admirer Mu'azzam, the Ayyubid ruler of Damascus, to suggest to Jalal al-Din an attack on the Armenian town of Akhlat as a diversionary movement in a campaign against his

brother Ashraf, the ruler of Harran and Mayyafariqin, who held the town as the most easterly of his various fiefs. Jalal al-Din was already en route for Akhlat when news reached him of suspicious behaviour on the part of Baraq Hajib, and he abandoned this new adventure in order to deal with his rebellious vassal. Accompanied by less than 300 horse he rode from the Tiflis region to the borders of Kirman in the amazingly short space of seventeen days. As on a previous occasion Baraq adopted an attitude of courteous defiance; and, realizing the strength of his position, the sultan had no option but to turn back. He halted at Isfahan to rest his horses; and the Isfahan! poet Kamal al-Din Isma'il composed a fine qasida1 upon his spectacular dash from the Caucasus mountains to the Dasht-i-Lut. Here he received a report from his vizier Sharaf al-Mulk, who during his absence had led a raid into the Erzerum region to replenish the garrison's dwindling provisions; whilst returning through the territories of Akhlat he had been attacked by Ashraf's representative, the hdjib H u s a m al-Din 'All of Mosul, who was able to recover the whole of the booty. Despite this provocation Jalal al-Din did not, upon his return to Tiflis in the early autumn, immedi ately resume his attack upon Akhlat. Instead he laid siege to the Armenian towns of Ani and Kars, both held by the Georgians, which he continued to invest until the beginning of October, when he returned to Tiflis and from Tiflis made a ten-day foray into western Georgia. All of these movements were designed to mask his real intentions and to lull Husam al-Din into false security. In this he was not entirely successful, for when he appeared before Akhlat on 7 November the hajib had had two days' notice of his approach. In their second assault the sultan's men forced their way into the town, where, however, they committed such atrocities that the population, filled with the courage of despair, were not only able to eject them but also to beat off a further attack launched a few days later. Meanwhile, there had been a heavy snowfall in Armenia and reports had reached the sultan that the Ive Turkmen, thinking he was stuck fast before Akhlat, had occupied Ushnuyeh and Urmiyeh and extended their marauding activities to the very walls of Tabriz. On 15 December he raised the siege of Akhlat and hastened back to Azarbaijan. The Turkmen were soon dealt with, but other preoccupations prevented Jalal al-Din from resuming the assault on Akhlat. In February or March 1227 the Georgians attacked and burnt Tiflis and

had dispersed before the sultan could overtake them. Then Orkhan, one of his oldest and most trusted commanders, was murdered in Ganja by Isma'ili assassins, and to avenge his death the sultan carried fire and sword into all the Isma'Ili territories from Alamut to Gird-Kuh. Next came news of a Mongol army advancing westwards and already at Damghan on the borders of his territory. The sultan attacked these invaders, put them to flight and followed them in close pursuit for a number of days; he then halted near Ray in case they might rally and return to the attack and receiving a report that large forces were in fact approaching he decided to stay and await their arrival. Such, according to Ibn al-Athir,1 was the sequence of events in 1227. Neither Nasawi nor Juvaini mentions the campaign against the Isma'llls or, what is stranger still, the defeat of the Mongols in the Damghan region. All authorities are at any rate agreed that the major encounter with the Mongols occurred in the following year. In 1228, so Ibn al-Athir2 tells us, Jalal al-Dln fought many battles with the Mongols: his informants differed as to the actual number, but most of them went against him, only in the last was he victorious. This was the Battle of Isfahan, fought according to Nasawi,3 on 22 Ramadan 625/25 August 1228, which seems in point of fact to have been a Pyrrhic victory for the Mongols. Nasawi's4 account of the battle is in broad agreement with Juvaini's5 less-detailed version. Proceeding direct from Tabriz to Isfahan (and not withdrawing in that direction from Ray as in Ibn al-Athir's6 account) the sultan gathered together his forces and calmly awaited the enemy's approach. When the Mongols encamped a day's journey to the east of the town, he did not immedi ately give battle having been advised by his astrologers not to engage the enemy until the fourth day. The Mongols interpreted his inaction as unwillingness to fight and thinking it might be necessary to lay siege to the town, dispatched a foraging party of 2,000 horse into the Luristan mountains to procure provisions. Jalal al-Dln caused them to be followed by a detachment of 3,000 men who, having seized the passes and cut off their retreat, returned to Isfahan with 400 prisoners. Of these wretches some were handed over to the qadi and ra'is to be massacred in the streets of the town for the delectation and encourage ment of the populace; the rest he decapitated personally in the court

yard of his palace, the bodies being dragged out into the open country to be devoured by dogs and vultures. On the day approved by the astrologers the sultan was drawing up his army in battle-order when Ghiyath al-Dln, who had been nursing a grudge against his brother, suddenly withdrew along with all the forces under his command. Un disturbed by this defection the sultan, perceiving the enemy's numbers to be inferior to his own, ordered the local infantry to return to the town, as a gesture at once of self-confidence and of contempt for his opponents. Towards evening the right wing of his army charged the M o n g o l s ' left, broke through and pursued the fleeing enemy as far as Kashan. Satisfied with this success Jalal al-Dln was resting on the side of a ravine when he was approached by one of his chief officers, who urged him not to let the enemy escape under cover of darkness but to avail himself of the opportunity to destroy them utterly. The sultan at once mounted horse but had hardly reached the end of the ravine before a Mongol force, which had been lying in ambush, charged down upon the left wing driving them back against the centre. The sultan's commanders in the left wing were killed almost to a man, and the centre, where he himself was stationed, was in utter confusion, sur rounded on every side by the enemy. His very standard-bearer turned in flight, and Jalal al-Dln struck him down with his own hand before cutting his way through the Mongol ranks and making good his escape. What was left of the centre and left wing fled in various direc tions : some to Fars, some to Kirman and some to Azarbaijan, while those who had lost their horses made their way back to Isfahan. T w o days later the right wing returned from K a s h a n expecting to find the rest of the army equally victorious; learning of their defeat and dispersal they too disbanded, leaving Isfahan at the mercy of the invaders. The Mongols, however, who had suffered even greater losses than their opponents, were content to show themselves before the walls of the town; they then retreated northward with such speed that they reached Ray in three days; they continued eastwards to Nishapur and were soon beyond the Oxus. As for the sultan a whole week passed without news of his whereabouts; he was believed dead and there was talk of appointing Yaghan Taisi' as his successor. The qadi persuaded the citizens to postpone any decision until the 'Id al-fitr; and Jalal al-Dln, who had been hiding in the Luristan mountains, appeared just in time to preside over the celebrations. Entering the town amidst universal rejoicings he honoured and promoted those of his commanders and

soldiers who had distinguished themselves in the battle whilst punishing others for their absence or inactivity. He remained only a day or two in Isfahan before proceeding northwards in the wake of the retreating Mongols; from Ray he dispatched bodies of horsemen even into the desolate wastes of Khurasan. Upon returning to Tabriz the sultan received disturbing news about his brother Ghiyath al-Dln. After his defection at the Battle of Isfahan Ghiyath al-Din had taken refuge in Khuzistan, where he stood under the direct protection of the caliph; he was now said to be heading northwards towards Isfahan. When this report reached the sultan he was playing polo in the great square. With typical impetuosity he flung down his mallet and at once took to the road only to learn en route that his brother had sought and obtained asylum with 'Ala' al-Din of Alamut. The Isma'Ili ruler refused to hand over the fugitive but guaranteed his good behaviour, and, apparently satisfied with his undertaking, the sultan returned to Azarbaijan. As for Ghiyath al-Din, his confinement in Alamut soon became irksome and he was lured by Baraq Hajib to Kirman, where both he and his mother (whom Baraq had compelled to marry him) were treacherously put to death. Late in 1228 Jalal al-Din approached Akhlat for the second time. He now had another score to settle with the hajib Husam al-Din. The Saljuq princess, Oz-Beg's former wife, was soon completely dis enchanted with her new husband and, angered by the discourteous behaviour of his lieutenant the vizier Sharaf al-Din during the sultan's absence in Central Persia, had not only invited the hajib to invade Azarbaijan but had accompanied him back to Akhlat. The sultan's troops do not appear on this occasion to have closely invested the town. Instead they pillaged and massacred through the length and breadth of Armenia penetrating to the Plain of Mush on the border of Jazireh or Upper Mesopotamia, and the people of Harran and Sariij, thinking the Khwarazmis intended to winter in that more temperate region, began a general exodus into Syria. Their fears, however, were groundless, for the sultan, when an unprecedented snowfall rendered further opera tions impossible, withdrew his forces into Azarbaijan. A renewal of the campaign in the spring of 1229, was prevented by a threat to the sultan's northern flank. The Georgians, now fully recovered from their earlier defeat, had formed a confederation of the various Caucasian peoples and were advancing southwards with a multi national army that included a contingent of 20,000 Qipchaq Turks. The

two sides came into view of each other at a place with the Georgian name of Mindor near the town of Lori, and it was at once evident that the enemy's forces vastly outnumbered the sultan's. Disdaining his vizier's advice to entrench himself and await reinforcements, the sultan drew up his men in preparation for battle. He then ascended a hill in order to observe the enemy more closely and, descrying the banners of the Qipchaq on the right wing, dispatched a messenger to remind them of the favours he had rendered them during his father's lifetime. The appeal was successful and the Qipchaq withdrew from the battlefield. Next, turning to the Georgians drawn up in front of him the sultan proposed a one-day truce, during which the young men of either side might engage in single combat. The proposal was readily accepted, and five champions rode forward in succession from the Georgian ranks, each to be felled by the sultan in person. Then, wearying of the sport and forgetful of the truce, he gave a sign with his whip, and his troops advanced at the charge to drive the enemy before them in headlong flight. Fresh from this and other victories in the Caucasus area the sultan, at the end of August 1229, sat down before the walls of Akhlat. This time he did not raise the siege with the advent of winter, although the bitter cold and heavy snowfalls obliged the besiegers for a while to forsake their posts and seek shelter in neighbouring villages. Meanwhile food supplies inside the town dwindled and deteriorated, and the besieged, who had begun by eating their sheep and oxen, were reduced to a diet of cats and d o g s , and even rats and mice. Akhlat was finally taken on 14 April 1230, and was subjected, apparently against the sultan's better judgment, to three days of looting. Husam al-Dln, his old adversary, was now dead, having been executed by the mamluk who had succeeded him as governor, and the sources are silent about the Saljuq princess whom he had abducted. Jalal al-Dln indemnified himself for her loss and avenged the slight to his honour by laying hands on a Georgian lady, the wife of Malik al-Ashraf, who had been left behind in the town. It was probably this act which decided Ashraf to join with Kai-Qubad, the Saljuq sultan of Rum, in taking up arms against Sultan Jalal al-Dln. Kai-Qubad had been greatly alarmed, not to say panic-stricken, by the capture of Akhlat, which he saw as an immediate threat to the eastern flank of his territories; and he had dispatched envoy after envoy to the Ayyubids with frantic appeals for an alliance against the sultan. With



HISTORY OF THE I L - K H A N S

the approval of the senior Ayyiibid, Malik al-Kamil of Egypt, Ashraf mustered his forces—5,000 seasoned troops—at Harran and moved northwards to link up, at Kai-Qubad's headquarters in Sivas, with an army of 20,000 Rumis. The allies then proceeded eastwards along the highway to Persia and halted in Arzinjan in the valley of the western Euphrates. The sultan, meanwhile, was following the same route in a westerly direction. He had left Akhlat to attack the town of Malazgird, when the ruler of Erzerum, a cousin of Kai-Qubad, who had supplied him with provisions and forage during the siege, came to inform him of the alliance concluded between his cousin and the Ayyubids; he advised the sultan to advance to the attack before their forces could combine. Jalal al-Dln accepted his advice and had pushed forward as far as Khartabirt, where he fell ill; by the time he had recovered sufficiently to continue the march the allies had already linked up. The first clash with the enemy occurred in the village o f Yasi-Chaman, somewhat to the east of Arzinjan, on 7 August, when a detachment of Rumi troops were surrounded and cut to pieces. Two days later the main armies were in contact and there was some skirmishing; but they did not join battle in earnest until the 10th. The Khwarazmis were decisively defeated, whether because they lost their bearings in the mist, or because of a sand storm that blew in their faces, or simply because of the weight of the enemy's numbers; and Jalal al-Dln fled to K h u y , pausing en route at Akhlat only long enough to collect such stores and valuables as could be readily transported.1 From Akhlat, which he now reoccupied, Ashraf entered into negotia tions with the sultan; and peace was concluded on condition that Jalal al-Dln should henceforth respect the territories of both the Ayyubids and the Saljuqs. With respect to Kai-Qubad the sultan gave this under taking with great unwillingness and only upon receiving reports that large forces of Mongols had arrived in Central Persia. This was the army, 30,000 strong, under the command of the noyan Chormaghun, dispatched by Ogedei, the son and first successor ( 1 2 2 9 - 4 1 ) o f Chingiz-Khan, to complete the conquest of Persia and make an end of the sultan. It seemed at first as though the M o n g o l s might winter in 'Iraq-i 'Ajam, thus affording Jalal al-Dln time to reassemble his forces; but then came news of an army at Sarab, only sixty miles east of Tabriz. The sultan set out at great speed for Ahar, where he passed the night; the roof of the palace in which he lodged caved in and he took this for

an evil omen. He made his way to the Mughan Steppe, where the Mongols all but caught up with him; he shook them off by abandoning his encampment under cover of darkness and hiding in the mountains of Kapan, in what is today the extreme south-east of Soviet Armenia. The winter of 1230-1 he passed in Urmiyeh and Ushnuyeh; later we find him in Arran sentencing his vizier Sharaf al-Mulk, justly or un justly, to death and suppressing a revolt in Ganja; then involved in fruitless negotiations with the Ayyubid governor of Akhlat; and finally en route for Diyarbakr, apparently to join the ruler of A m i d in an attack upon the sultan of Rum. In the middle of August 1231 he encamped in the immediate vicinity of Amid; he drank heavily that night and was sunk in intoxicated sleep when, at day break, the Mongols launched their attack. Roused by one of his generals he effected his escape whilst the enemy was pursuing the bulk of his army, which, led by the same general, made its way to Irbil and finally to Isfahan. T h e sultan, mean while, with only a small following, rode up to the walls of Amid and, being refused admission, turned back in the direction of Mayyafariqin and encamped outside a nearby village. Again overtaken by the Mongols he killed two of his pursuers and made off into the mountains. Here, he was captured by the Kurds, who murdered him for his clothes and horse, according to some authorities, or for motives of revenge, according to others. In due course the ruler of Amid recovered his body and gave it burial; but many refused to believe that he was dead and years later, when the whole of his domains were subject to Mongol rule, pretenders would arise claiming to be Sultan Jalal al-Dln. Such was the end of the last of the Khwarazm-Shahs. Nasawi1 describes him as a short, dark man, Turkish in appearance and in speech, though he spoke Persian also. Grave and taciturn by nature he smiled rather than laughed and never lost his temper or used abusive language. His qualities, in d'Ohsson's judgment, were those of a Turkmen warrior rather than of a general or a sovereign. This is to do him less than justice. For all his faults, he alone of his contemporaries, as was recognized by friend and foe alike, was a match for the invaders. Jalal al-Dln and his army formed a wall between Islam and the Tartars. That wall had now been breached and neither Ayyubid nor Saljuq was capable of stemming the flood.

HISTORY OF THE IL-KHANS
THE MONGOL VICEROYS
After the death of Sultan Jalal al-Din the military operations of Chormaghun were conducted in the Caucasus, Upper Mesopotamia and Asia Minor, and henceforth he was to exercise only an indirect influence on the course of events in Persia. One consequence of his passage through Iran had been the Mongol re-occupation of Khurasan and the gradual establishment of a civil administration in that unhappy region now slowly recovering from the state of utter desolation in which it had lain since the invasion. At the time of the conquest of Gurganj, a certain Chin-Temur, a Qara-Khitayan by origin, had been appointed basqaq of that area. H e now received orders to lead his forces westwards in support of Chormaghun and, arriving in Khurasan, proceeded systematically to reduce the province to subjection, setting basqaqs over such places as had submitted. In this work he was hampered by the activities of two former generals of Sultan Jalal al-Din, Qaracha and Yaghan-Sonqur, who were conducting guerrilla warfare against the Mongols in the Nishapur region. News of these operations having reached the Great Khan, he was greatly enraged and instructed the noyan Dayir to set out from his base at Badghis and, having first dealt with Qaracha, to put the whole population of Khurasan to the sword. Dayir's troops were already on the move when he received the news that Qaracha had been driven out of Khurasan by Kiil-Bolat, a lieu tenant of Chin-Temur, and had entrenched himself in Zarang in Sistan. Dayir proceeded to lay siege to Zarang, which held out for nearly two years, and upon its surrender dispatched messengers to Chin-Temur asserting his claim to the governorship of Khurasan. In this he was supported by Chormaghun, who called upon Chin-Temur to join him in the West, whilst leaving the administration of Khurasan and Mazandaran in the hands of Dayir. Chin-Temur decided to appeal to the Great Khan, to whom accordingly he dispatched a mission headed by Kiil-Bolat and including several local rulers who had made their sub mission to the Mongols. Ogedei was pleased with the mission, remarking that Chormaghun, despite the vastly greater territory under his control, had never sent tributary princes to wait upon him; and he issued a yarligh or rescript giving official status to Chin-Temur as the governor of Khurasan and Mazandaran. A second mission, led by an Uighur Turk called Korgiiz accompanied by Baha' al-Din Juvaini, the father of the historian, w h o m Chin-Temiir had made his sahib-divan or

minister of finance, was equally successful but brought no benefit to Chin-Temur, who had died before the mission returned (633/1235-6). He was succeeded in his office by Nosal, an aged Mongol said to have been more than 100 years old, who died in 637/1239-40, already in effect superseded by the Uighur K o r g u z , a clever and ambitious man, who, as the result of a second visit to Mongolia, had been given special powers by the Great Khan. Korgiiz proceeded upon his return to hold a census and to reassess the taxes, but was soon obliged to return to Mongolia to answer charges laid against him by the family and de pendants of Chin-Temiir. Not only did he triumph over these adver saries, but he was granted letters-patent conferring upon him the civil administration of all the territories held by Chormaghun in Western Asia. Returning to Khurasan at the end of 1239 he at once sent agents to 'Iraq-i cAjam, Arran and Azarbaljan to take over from the military commanders, whilst he established his own headquarters in Tus. The town was still in ruins, only some fifty houses remaining standing, but with Korguz's encouragement and example was now speedily re-built. Public order was restored, and Juvaini tells us,1 with the usual hyper bole, that an amir who had previously cut off heads with impunity would not now venture to decapitate a chicken, whilst the morale of the peasantry was so high " that if a great army of Mongols encamped in a field they might not even ask a peasant to hold a horse's head, let alone demanding p r o v i s i o n s . . . " Korguz's career was, however, nearly at its end. A dispute with his vizier, one Sharaf al-Din, a man of the people from Khwarazm, whose character can hardly have been as black as it is painted by Juvaini,2 caused him to set out upon a fourth journey to Mongolia. This was presumably in the winter of 1241-2, for he was met en route with the news of the Great K h a n ' s death, which occurred on 11 December 1241. When passing through the territories of Chaghatai, then only recently dead, he had in the course of an alter cation with an official made a remark which had given offence to Chaghatai's widow. Fearful of the consequences of his words in the new and unpredictable situation he hurried back to Khurasan. His fears were not groundless, for no sooner had he returned to Tus than the emissaries of Chaghatai's family—one of them his successor, Arghun Aqa—arrived in the town. H e was arrested and taken first to Ulugh-Ef, the ordu of Chaghatai near the present-day Kulja and then to the court of Toregene, the widow of Ogedei and Regent of the Empire (1242-6)

in Qara-Qorum. Here it was ruled that the crime should be tried where it had been committed, in Chaghatai's territory. Korgiiz was in conse quence brought back to Ulugh-Ef, where, by the orders of QaraHiilegu, the grandson and first successor (1242-6) of Chaghatai, he was put to a cruel death. Originally a Buddhist despite his name (the Turkish for George) Korgiiz had towards the end of his life become a convert to Islam, an indication perhaps of some feeling of solidarity with his Muslim subjects. Arghun Aqa had already been appointed to succeed Korgiiz as the viceroy of the conquered territories in the West, i.e. of a region embracing Iran, the southern Caucasus area and part of Upper Mesopo tamia and Asia Minor. He arrived in Khurasan in 641/1243-4 and left almost immediately on a tour of inspection of 'Iraq-i 'Ajam and Azarbaijan. From Tabriz, where he received embassies from the sultan of Rum and the Ayyubid rulers of Damascus and Aleppo, he was summoned to attend the quriltai or assembly of the M o n g o l princes at which Giiyiik, the son of Ogedei, was elected his successor as Great Khan (1246). Confirmed in his office and loaded with honours by the new khan, Arghun returned to Khurasan in the spring of 1247. He spent some time in Marv before passing on to Tus, where he ordered the rebuilding of the Saljuq palace called the Mansuriyya. He then relaxed for a while in the meadows of Radkan, a region of copious springs and lush grass, which seems to have made a special appeal to the Mongols, and in the late autumn of 1247 set out for Tabriz by way of Mazandaran. At Amul he was magnificently entertained by Juvaini's father, the sahib-divan, and was about to resume his journey when he received news of intrigues against him in the Mongol capital; and he determined to return thither without delay. On this journey he was accompanied not only by the sahib-divan but also by the latter's son, the future historian. The party had reached Talas, the present-day Jambul in Kazakhstan, when they were met with the tidings of Giiyuk's death (which had occurred in April 1248); at the same time there came news of the approach of the noyan Eljigidei at the head of a large army. The purpose of this expedition is not clear: it was perhaps intended that Eljigidei, as the khan's personal representative, was to supersede Baiju (who had succeeded Chormaghun in 1242) as commander of the Mongol forces in Western Asia. Arghun hurried forward to meet him and at his insistence returned to Khurasan to supervise the equipment and provisioning of his army. It was not until the late summer of 1249



THE MONGOL VICEROYS
that he was able to resume his interrupted journey to Mongolia. His case was duly investigated in the ordu of Oghul-Qaimish, Guyuk's widow, then Regent of the Empire; and a decision was reached in his favour. On the homeward journey the party (of which the historian Juvaini was one) halted for a month or two at the ordu of YesiiMongke, who now ruled over the apanage of Chaghatai. The party had arrived in Almaligh in the late summer or early autumn of 1250; they left in the winter, when the roads were blocked with snow, but never theless made rapid progress and had soon reached Marv in Khurasan. Arghun did not remain long in Iran. In August or September 1251 he again set out for the East in order to attend the quriltai which had been summoned to enthrone the new khan, Mongke (1251-9), the eldest son of Tolui. The enthronement had in fact already taken place (on 1 July 1251), though the news did not reach Arghun until his arrival at Talas. It was now mid-winter and the deep snow made travelling almost impossible. Nevertheless the party struggled on and finally came to Besh-Baliq, the old Uighur capital, a little to the north-west of Guchen in Sinkiang. From here Arghun sent a message to inform the new khan of his approach, but the party did not reach the Mongol Court till 2 May 1252, nearly a year after Mongke's enthronement. Arghun reported on the chaotic condition of finances in the territories under his control, and it was decided that a more equitable form of taxation known as qubchur, already in force in Transoxiana, should be introduced in the Western countries also. The deliberations over these and other matters lasted so long that it was not until August or September 1253 that Arghun finally took his leave. It was during this lengthy stay in Mongolia that Juvaini, who had again accompanied Arghun, was persuaded to embark upon his history of the Mongol conquests.
Upon his return to Khurasan Arghun dispatched officials to the various parts of Persia to carry out the fiscal reforms. H e himself set out for the Court of Batu, the son of Jochi and founder of the Golden Horde, to deal with certain unspecified business, apparently on the instructions of the Great Khan. Returning by way of Darband he conducted a census and imposed the new qubchur tax in Georgia, Arran and Azarbaijan before proceeding to cIraq-i 'Ajam. In the meanwhile, availing themselves of his absence, certain of his enemies at the Mongol Court had secured a yarligh for the dispatch of an inspector to Khurasan to examine his accounts. Reports of this official's arrival and activities must have reached Arghun more or less simultaneously with news that

the Great Khan's younger brother, Prince Hiilegii, was advancing westward at the head of a great army. In November 1255 he waited on Hiilegii at Kish, the present-day Shahr-i Sabz in Uzbekistan and accompanied him as far as Shuburqan before continuing on his way to Mongolia once again to triumph over his accusers. Arghun was to spend the remainder of his life in the service of the ll-Khans. He returned to the West, according to Juvaini, in September 1258, although Rashid al-Dln represents him as being present, in Hiilegii's suite, at the siege of Baghdad (January-February 1258). In 1259 and 12 60 he was in Georgia introducing the qubchur and conducting military operations against the rebel princes. He held, under both Hiilegii and Abaqa, . the office of Tax-Farmer General (muqdtf-i matndlik). A s deputy to the viceroy of Khurasan, Abaqa's younger brother Tiibshin, he took part in the war with Baraq, the ruler of Transoxiana, in 1270. He died in the meadows of Radkan in May or June 1275.

At the quriltai of 12 51 the Great Khan Mongke had decided to complete and consolidate the Mongol conquests by dispatching his brothers Qubilai and Hiilegii to China and Western Asia respectively. The victories of Qubilai (Kubla Khan), the successor of Mongke as Great Khan ( 1 2 6 0 - 9 4 ) and founder of the Yuan dynasty, fall outside the scope of this v o l u m e . 1 A s for Hiilegii, his instructions were in the first place to destroy the Isma'ilis and demolish their castles and then, this task completed, to put down the Kurds and Lurs: the caliph was to be attacked only if he refused to tender his allegiance. Elaborate prepara tions were made for the passage of Hiilegii's army through Central Asia. The road was cleared of boulders and thorny shrubs; bridges were built over small, and ferries provided for the crossing of larger rivers; and all pasturage on either side of the route, from the Khangai mountains to the Oxus, was reserved for the exclusive use of Hiilegii's army. That army, probably larger than the forces which Chingiz-Khan led westward in 1 2 1 9 , included contingents from all the Mongol princes, the sons, brothers and nephews of the Great Khan; and special mention should be made, in view of later developments, of the con tingent sent by Batu and led by two of Jochi's grandsons, Balaghai and Quli, and one great grandson, Tutar, as also of the contingent from

Chaghatai's ulus led by one of his grandsons, Tegiider. T h e army like wise included a corps of Chinese mangonel-men and naphtha-throwers for employment in siege operations. Hiilegii advanced westward at a leisurely pace necessitated perhaps by the size and unwieldiness of his forces. Setting out from his own ordu in October 125 3 he halted for a time at Ulugh-Ef, where he was entertained by Princess Orqi'na, the widow of Chaghatai and now ( 1 2 5 2 - 6 1 ) the ruler of his ulus. The summer of 1254 Hiilegii passed in mountain pastures somewhere on the eastern borders of Transoxiana. In late September 1255 he encamped in the famous meadows of Kan-i Gil to the east of Samarqand. Here he was visited by Shams al-Dln Muhammad, the founder (1245-78) of the Kart dynasty of Herat, who had demonstrated his loyalty to the Mongols by taking part in their invasion of India in 1246. Early in November Hiilegii pressed on to Kish, where, as we have seen, he was joined by the viceroy Arghun Aqa. From Kish he dispatched express couriers to the various Persian rulers informing them of his intention to extirpate the Isma'ilis and calling upon them to render assistance or suffer the consequences of their refusal or inactivity. Many of these rulers, including Sa'd, the heir and successor (1226-60) of the Atabeg Muzaffar al-Dln of Fars, came to do homage in person, as did also the rival sultans of Rum, cIzz al-Dln and Rukn al-Dln. After a month's stay in Kish the army continued on its way to the Oxus, which it crossed on bridges of boats commandeered from the ferrymen. On the left bank of the river Hiilegii amused himself with a tiger hunt, in which the hunters rode on Bactrian camels in place of their terrified horses. The next halting-place was in the meadows of Shuburqan (the present-day Shibarkhan in north-western Afghanistan), where only a short stay had been intended; but heavy snowfalls and bitter cold obliged Hiilegii to pass the remainder of the winter in this area. In the early spring of 1256 Arghun Aqa took leave of the Mongol prince having first entertained him in " a large tent of fine linen em broidered with delicate embroideries, with gold and silver plate in keeping with i t " ; 1 and Hiilegii entered Kuhistan to come for the first time in contact with the Isma'ilis.
As the army was passing through the districts of Zaveh and Khwaf, there occurred a number of "incidents", a vague term used by both Juvaini2 and Rashid al-Dln3 presumably with reference to surprise

attacks by Isma'lli fidd'Is; and Hulegii dispatched the generals K o k e Ilge and Ket-Buqa to attack the Isma'ili stronghold of Tun. Ket-Buqa, a Nestorian Christian, famous afterwards as the Mongol commander at 'Ain Jalut, had had considerable experience in fighting this enemy. At the head of Hiilegii's advanced guard, a body of 12,000 men, he had crossed the Oxus in March 1253, captured several places in Kuhistan and then laid unsuccessful siege to the celebrated fortress of Gird-Kuh in May of the same year. In August he had attacked the castle of Shahdiz near Ray and sent a raiding party still farther west into the Alamut region. Returning to Kuhistan he had harried the country a second time and captured several strongholds, including Tun. The town, says Juvaini,1 " h a d apparently not yet been humbled and still persisted in its former benightedness..." Koke-Ilge and Ket-Buqa arrived before the gates on 4 April 1 2 5 6 ; they took the town on the 1 6 t h and slaughtered all the inhabitants, except the younger women, according to Juvaini,2 or the artisans, according to Rashid al-Din.3 Their mission accomplished the two generals rejoined the main army, then on its way to Tus.
At Tus as at Shuburqan Hulegii was lodged in a beautiful tent which Arghun Aqa had had especially constructed for his accommodation on the instructions of the Great Khan. After a few days of feasting and revelry he moved on to the gardens of Mansuriyya, the Saljuq palace restored by Arghun Aqa, where he was entertained with a banquet by Arghun's wives. Leaving Tus the army encamped for a day or two in the meadows of Radkan before proceeding to Khabushan (the modern Quchan), " a t o w n " to quote Juvaini,4 "which had been derelict and in ruins from the first incursion of the M o n g o l army until that year, its buildings desolate and the qandts without water and no walls still standing save those of the Friday mosque". The historian, whose motives were not altogether disinterested, for he had purchased a quarter of the town for himself, approached Hulegii on the subject of Khabushan and obtained his authority for the complete restoration of the town at the expense of the treasury. Hulegii remained in this region for a month and then resumed the advance westward. On 24 July he was rejoined by the ambassadors he had sent to the Isma'ili Grand Master, Rukn al-Din Khur-Shah, to convey the terms of surrender. From Khurqan near Bistam, where he

had arrived on 2 September, he dispatched a second embassy to Rukn al-Din. The Grand Master, acting on the advice of the famous philo sopher Nasir al-Din Tusi and other learned men detained against their will amongst the Isma'ilis, decided to send his brother Shahanshah to make professions of submission. Hiilegii received Shahanshah with every honour and dispatched a third embassy with the message that Rukn al-Din should now demonstrate his submission by demolishing his castles. Dissatisfied with the Grand Master's response Hiilegii prepared for battle. In the middle of September he advanced from Khurqan at the head of 10,000 men, whilst the various armies con verged on Rukn al-Dln's residence, the well-nigh impregnable castle of Maimun-Diz,1 Buqa-Temiir and Koke-Ilge approaching by way of Mazandaran, Tegiider and Ket-Buqa by way of Simnan and Khuvar and Tutar and Balaghai from the direction of Alamut. And again he sent ambassadors, to notify Rukn al-Din of his intention and to promise an amnesty if he presented himself in person. As Hiilegii passed by Firiizkuh the ambassadors returned accompanied by Rukn al-Din's vizier, who undertook to destroy the castles but asked that Rukn alDin might be allowed a year's respite before vacating Maimun-Diz and that the castles of Alamut and Lanbasar might be spared from destruction. Meanwhile Hiilegii continued to advance through Lar and Damavand, and the castle of Shahdiz, to which Ket-Buqa had laid siege ''two years previously, was captured within two days. Yet once again he sent ambassadors to Rukn al-Din calling upon him to present himself before him. The Grand Master now agreed to send his son and to demolish all of the castles; and Hiilegii halted at 'Abbasabad near Ray to await the son's arrival. On 8 October Rukn al-Din sent a child of seven or eight, his own or his father's by some irregular union. Hiilegii sent the boy back on the ground that he was too young and asked instead for one of Rukn al-Din's brothers to relieve Shahanshah. On 27 October the Grand Master sent his brother Shiran-Shah, who was received by Hiilegii near Ray; and he, or more probably Shahanshah, returned on the 3 1 s t bearing a yarligh to the effect that provided Rukn al-Din dismantled his castles he had nothing to fear.
This message was apparently intended to lull Rukn al-Din into false security, just as the latter's embassies had been designed to delay the Mongol's assault until the winter snows rendered it impracticable. The

weather, however, remained unseasonably mild and, his victim being now completely encircled, Hiilegu ordered the various armies to close in whilst he himself advanced from the direction of Pishkil-Dara through Taliqan. On 8 November he was encamped on a hilltop facing Maimun-Diz from the north and the next day surveyed the castle from every side in search of some vulnerable point. The great strength of the fortifications, the approach of winter and the consequent difficulty of procuring supplies were advanced as reasons for postponing siege operations until the spring; but a minority of the princes and generals favoured immediate investment of the castle and Hulegii supported their view. In the event the siege was to last less than a fortnight. Great pine trees, planted in former times by the Isma'ilis themselves, were felled by the Mongols to serve as poles for their mangonels; and in addition to these normal siege instruments a Chinese ballista, with a range of 2,500 paces, discharged its missiles against the garrison. In the face of this bombardment the Isma'ills ceased fighting and asked for a truce, which was granted. Then Rukn al-Din asked for a yarligh granting him safe-conduct if he descended from the castle. This too was granted, the yarligh being drawn up by the historian Juvaini who functioned as Hiilegii's secretary. Still the Grand Master failed to appear, and the bombardment was resumed on a much larger scale. N o w at last Rukn al-Din decided to surrender and sent down his brother Shiran-Shah and one of his sons with a group of notables including Nasir al-Din Tusi; on the following day, 29 Shawwal/19 November, according to Juvaini,1 or on the day after, according to Rashid al-Din,2 who quotes a chronogram by Nasir al-Din, he came down himself. The next day Rukn al-Din brought all of his family and following down out of the castle; and the Mongols climbed up to begin the work of demolition. They were attacked by some of the more fanatical fida'is, whose desperate resistance was broken only after four days of fighting. Meanwhile, Rukn al-Din had been kindly received by Hiilegii, though kept as a prisoner at large under the surveillance of a Mongol commander. At Hiilegii's behest he dispatched bodies of men to destroy the Isma'ili castles in the whole of the region. Forty such castles were demolished, only Alamiit and Lanbasar refusing to admit these emissaries. Alamut was invested by Balaghai until surrender terms were negotiated through the good offices of Rukn al-Din. The work of demolition then began, but the historian Juvaini, with Hiilegii's

345
permission, was able to salvage part of the celebrated library, as also a quantity of astronomical instruments. Lanbasar was approached by Hiilegii in person. Finding the garrison disinclined to surrender he left Dayir-Buqa to lay siege to the castle (which, in the event, was to hold out for a full year) and, on 4 January 1 2 5 7 , set out for his chief ordu, then situated some twenty miles from Qazvln, where he celebrated the Mongol New Year festival with a week of revelry. Rukn al-Dln seems to have accompanied Hiilegu to his ordu, though his family and posses sions had been transferred to Qazvin. Because he was still of use to him Hiilegii continued to treat him with honour and consideration, bestowing upon him a Mongol girl of whom he became enamoured and even humouring him in his curious pastime of watching camelfights. With the Grand Master's co-operation it had been possible for Hiilegii to secure the speedy surrender of scores of Isma'ill castles, many of which (as was in fact the case with Gird-Kuh) could have withstood a siege of many years. Once his usefulness was exhausted, however, his presence was a source of embarrassment to Hiilegii, who acceded with alacrity to his request that he might be sent to the Great Khan. Rukn al-Dln did not return from this journey. According to Juvaini,1 he actually reached the Mongol Court, was reproached by Mongke with the continued resistance of Lanbasar and Gird-Kuh and was murdered by his escort in the Khangai mountains on the way back. Rashid al-Dln,2 on the other hand, tells us that he was put to death on the outward journey, at the express orders of the Great Khan, who protested at the wasting of relay animals upon such a visitor. His departure was the signal for a general massacre of his followers, and all the Isma'llls in Mongol custody, including Rukn al-Dln's own family at Qazvin, were put to the sword, not even infants in the cradle being spared. Their wholesale slaughter was carried out, according to Juvaini,3 not only by order of the Great Khan Mongke but in fulfil ment of ayasa of Chingiz-Khan himself.
By the virtual extinction of the Isma'ili sect Hiilegii had rendered a great, if unintentional, service to orthodox Islam. His next blow was to be directed against the founthead of orthodoxy, the 'Abbasid Caliphate. The Il-Khan,4 as we may now call him, proceeded with the same

deliberation as in his advance through Central Asia. In March or April 1257 he left the Qazvin area en route for Hamadan and was joined, apparently before reaching his destination, by Baiju, the successor of Chormaghun in the West, whom he presumably instructed on the role of his army in the forthcoming campaign. Hulegii himself, with the Jochid princes Quli, Balaghai and Tutar, encamped on the Hamadan plain, from whence, after a brief stay, he set off in the direction of Baghdad, arriving in Dinavar on 26 April; he then, for some unknown reason, returned to Hamadan; on 26 July he was in Tabriz and on 21 September back in Hamadan. Here began what Grousset1 has called the " dialogue epistolaire" between Hiilegii and the caliph, " u n des plus grandioses de l'histoire". T h e gist of Hiilegii's first message, shorn of Rashid al-Din's rhetoric, was that the caliph should either present himself in person or send his three principal officers, the vizier, the commander-in-chief and the lesser davdt-ddr or vice-chancellor; the caliph's reply was to the effect that this raw and inexperienced young man should return whence he had come. There followed a second exchange in similar tone, after which, wishing to secure his passage through the Zagros mountains, Hiilegii established contact with the caliph's governor of Dartang and persuaded him to hand over the castles in his area: though the governor afterwards repented of his treason, the castles were retained through the intervention of Ket-Buqa at the head of 30,000 horse. The way being thus cleared, the Il-Khan consulted his leading men as to the advisability of an attack on Baghdad. The astronomer Husam al-Din, who, despite his Muslim name, had been attached to Hiilegii by the order of the Great Khan, spoke openly against such a move. Every ruler who had attacked Baghdad and the 'Abbasids had forfeited his kingdom and his life; and he foretold six natural disasters that would occur if Hiilegii made the attempt. Hulegii then turned to Nasir al-Din Tusi, who had now joined his suite, and asked his opinion. With equal discretion and common sense the philo sopher replied that none of these disasters would occur. " What then will happen ? " asked the Il-Khan. " Hiilegii will reign in place of Musta'sim", he replied; and in a disputation with Husam al-Din he had no difficulty in citing a number of cases in which the caliphs had come to a violent end without any consequent calamity. The decision being now taken, the Mongol armies converged on Baghdad. Baiju, coming from the direction of Irbil, crossed the Tigris

at Mosul and encamped to the west of Baghdad to await the arrival of the forces from the East. Of these the right wing, commanded by Balaghai, Tutar and Quli, was advancing through Shahrazur and Daquqa, the centre under Hiilegii himself by way of Kirmanshah and Hulwan, and the left wing under Ket-Buqa by way of Luristan and Khuzistan. Hiilegii set out from the Hamadan area in November 1257. From Asadabad he again summoned the caliph to his presence, and at Dinavar he received the caliph's ambassador again advising him to turn back. He replied that having travelled so far he could not return without having met the caliph face to face. On 6 December he reached Kirman shah, which must have offered some resistance, for the town was sacked and the inhabitants massacred. From here he summoned Baiju and his officers to a council of war. They joined him at Taq-i Girra, the socalled " Zagrian Gates " , and, their consultations completed, set off to recross the Tigris and take up their position to the west of Baghdad. Hiilegu sent yet another warning to the caliph and, passing through the defile, encamped on the banks of the Hulwan river, where he remained from 18 to 31 December. In the meantime, Ket-Buqa had conquered the greater part of Luristan; and Baiju, by 16 January 1258, having crossed the Tigris, had reached the banks of the Nahr 'Isa. Here Suqunchaq, the future governor of cIraq-i "Arab and Fars, obtained his permission to lead the advanced forces and pushed forward as far as Harbiyya. The davat-dar, who commanded the caliph's army, was encamped between Ba'quba and Bajisra. Hearing of a Mongol army approaching from the west he crossed the Tigris and joined battle with Suqunchaq near Anbar. The Mongols retreated to a place which Rashid al-Din1 calls Bashiriyya, apparently on a branch of the Dujail called Nahr Bashir. Here they were rallied by Baiju, who came up with the main army. T h e M o n g o l s then opened a dyke and flooded the whole area behind their opponents, and, attacking at dawn on 1 7 January, inflicted a heavy defeat on the caliph's troops, of whom 12,000 were killed in battle in addition to those drowned in the flood. O f the survivors some few, with the davat-dar at their head, made their way back to Baghdad, whilst others fled as far as Hilla and Kiifa.
Following up this victory Baiju's troops had by 22 January reached the western suburbs of Baghdad. In the meantime, Ket-Buqa, coming up from the south, had passed through Sarsar and penetrated the market district of Karkh; and Hiilegu himself, leaving his heavy baggage at

Khanaqin, had reached the eastern walls of Baghdad simultaneously with Baiju's approach to the western side. In accordance with their practice in siege operations the Mongols ringed the whole circum ference of the town with a kind of palisade called sibe; inside this fence they sunk a moat and set up their mangonels. The assault began on 29 January. On 4 February a breach in the Burj al-'Ajami ("Persian Tower"), the great bastion to the south-east of the Halba Gate, gave the Mongols access to the fortifications. Swarming in through this gap they drove the defenders to right and left along the wall tops and by evening were in control of the whole of the battlements. The situation was now desperate, and the davât-dâr made a vain attempt to escape by boat down the Tigris, while the caliph initiated a series of parleys which led to nothing and were finally broken off by Hulegii in annoyance at the wounding of one of his officers. The caliph's commander-in-chief, Sulaimân-Şhâh, the ive Türkmen, and the davât-dâr had been handed over to the Mongols during the parleying: they were now both of them executed. Left with no adviser except his unsympathetic and probably disloyal vizier Musta'şim decided upon surrender. On 10 February he came out of the town accompanied by his three sons and presented himself before Hiilegii. The Il-Khân addressed him with apparent kindness and affability and then asked him to order the inhabitants to lay down their arms and come out of the town. The caliph had a proclamation made to this effect, and the people poured through the gates only to be slaughtered as they issued into the open. Musta'sim himself and his sons were lodged, in the custody of Mongol guards, at the Kalwadha Gate, the present-day Southern Gate, near Ket-Buqa's encampment. The sack of Baghdad began on 13 February, and the killing, looting and burning continued for seven days, only the houses of Christians being spared. On the 15 th Hiilegii went on a tour of the caliph's palace and caused the terrified Musta'sim to disclose the whereabouts of his treasures. This is the occasion which gave rise to the story, familiar from the pages of Marco Polo and Sir John Mandeville, of the caliph's being starved to death in a tower full of gold and silver. The nucleus of this story is the account of the interview between Hiilegii and Musta'şim as given by Naşir al-Din Tüsi,1 who may well have been actually present. The Il-Khân "set a golden tray before the Caliph and said: ' E a t ! ' 'It is not edible,' said the Caliph. 'Then why didst thou keep it,' asked

the King, 'and not give it to thy soldiers? And why didst thou not make these iron doors into arrow-heads and come to the bank of the river so that I might not have been able to cross it ?' ' Such replied the Caliph, "was God's will' 'What will befall thee,' said the King, 'is also God's will.'" The caliph's death was in fact imminent. On 20 February, having called an end to the pillage and slaughter, Hiilegu left Baghdad for the village of Waqaf, which has not been identified but must have lain somewhere along the road to Khânaqïn. It was in this village on that same day that Musta'şim met his end. Both Naşir al-Din and Raşhid al-Din in his much fuller account are silent as to the manner of the caliph's death, but the late Muslim authorities are almost certainly right in stating that he was rolled up in a carpet and trampled or kicked to death, to avoid the shedding of his blood, such being the Mongols' method of executing their own princes. The vizier and the şâhib-divân were both confirmed in their offices, a circumstance which throws some doubt on the latter's loyalty also, and were ordered, in collaboration with other officials appointed by Hiilegii, " t o rebuild Baghdad, remove the slain and dead animals and reopen the bazaars".1 And dispatching his cousin Buqa-Temur to complete the conquest of southern 'Iraq-i 'Arab and Khûzistân the Il-Khân withdrew northwards, first to his ordu near Hamadan, and then into Âzarbâijân, where he was to remain for over a year before em barking upon a third campaign, against the Aiyübid states in Syria. He seems to have passed the earlier part of the summer in Marâgheh, which he was to make his capital city. It was here that Naşir al-Din Tüsi now began, under his patronage, to erect his famous observatory, and it was here, too, on 12 July 1258, that he received his vassal the non agenarian Badr al-Din Lu'lu' of Mosul, to whom he owed the capture of Irbil, vainly besieged by the noyan Urqatu. He appears, however, soon to have moved on to Tabriz, the capital of his son Abaqa and the later Il-Khâns ; here he was visited by both of the sultans of Rum and also by the Atabeg A b u Bakr of Fars, who came to offer his congratulations on a victory on which his protege the poet Sa'di had composed a famous marthiya or qasïda of mourning. The spoils of this and Hiilegii's earlier victory over the Ismâ'ïlïs had already been transported to Âzarbâijân, where they had been stored in a castle on the island of Shâhi in Lake Reza'iyeh (Urmiyeh). From these treasures a selection had been made as

presents to the Great Khan to whom Hulegii had dispatched a report on his conquests in Persia and Iraq and on his contemplated campaign against Syria. The motives underlying the invasion of Syria are somewhat obscure. The hostility between Hulegii and the Ayyübid Naşir Yusuf, "personnage médiocre et sans courage", as Grousset1 calls him, is too in substantial of itself to account for so vast an operation. Christian influences may well have been in play, and it is perhaps only a simpli fication of the actual circumstances when the Armenian Haithon2 represents his kinsman and namesake Het'um I of Little Armenia as holding counsel with Hiilegii on the conquest of Palestine and as saying to the Il-Khân: " Sire, the Sultan of Aleppo holds the lordship of the kingdom of Syria; and since you wish to recover the Holy Land, it seems to me best that you first of all lay siege to the city of Aleppo. F o r if thou canst take that city the others will soon be occupied." Aleppo was certainly Hiilegii's first and main objective. H e set out from Azarbâijân on 12 September 1259, having sent on Ket-Buqa ahead with the advanced forces. As before, he commanded the centre in person, entrusting the right wing to Shiktiir and Baiju and the left to Suqunchaq and his other commanders. The armies passed through the mountain pastures of Ala-Tagh to the east of Lake Van: Hiilegii was pleased with this region, afterwards a favourite summer resort of the Il-Khâns, and gave it a Mongol name. The route continued through Akhlât and the Hakkâri mountains, where there was great slaughter of the Kurdish inhabitants, into Diyârbakr. Here Hiilegii set about the systematic subjugation of Upper Mesopotamia. Dispatching his son Yoşhmut to Mayyafariqin, which surrendered only after a long and desperate siege, and Malik Şâlih, the son of Badr al-Din Lu'lu', to Amid, he himself captured Edessa, Dunaisir, Nasibin and Harran. Then crossing the Euphrates, the Mongols appeared suddenly and un expectedly before Aleppo, where they were joined by allies unmentioned by the Muslim sources, King Het'um and his son-in-law, Bohemond VI of Antioch. The siege of the town lasted less than a week, from 18 to 24 January 1 2 6 0 ; the citadel held out till 25 February. There was the usual methodical massacre lasting six full days; and King Het'um had the satisfaction of setting fire to the great mosque. T h e fate of Aleppo led to the bloodless surrender of Hama; and when the news reached Damascus Naşir Y u s u f fled towards E g y p t while a deputation of

notables offered Hulegii the keys of the town. Ket-Buqa made a triumphal entry on i March accompanied by King Het'um and Bohemond; and the administration of Damascus was entrusted to a Mongol shahna with three Persian deputies. By the early summer of 1260 the Il-Khan's troops had penetrated as far as Gaza, and it seemed that the conquest of Syria would be followed by the invasion of Egypt. It was at this juncture that Hulegii received the news of the Great Khan's death (which had in fact occurred nearly a year ago, on 11 August 1259); and he at once returned to Persia, leaving Ket-Buqa in command of an army considerably reduced in numbers, only 20,000 men, according to Kirakos,1 10,000, according to Haithon2 and Barhebraeus.3 The motive for Hulegii's withdrawal can hardly have been, as Rashid al-Dln4 implies, simply sorrow for the loss of his brother; he may have already felt some apprehension of a threat to his northern flank by Berke of the Golden H o r d e ; but Haithon5 is possibly right in suggesting that he saw himself as a candidate for the vacant throne. Rashid al-Din6 mentions only one point in his eastward journey: Akhlat, which he reached on 7 June. According to Haithon,7 he left his son Abaqa in command at Tabriz and continued for several days in an easterly direction. Then, receiving news of the election of Qubilai as Great Khan, he returned to Tabriz. It was probably here that he learnt, not, as stated by Haithon,8 of encroachments by Berke in the Caucasus area, but of a disastrous defeat in Syria.
Before leaving Syria Hulegii had sent an embassy to Qutuz, the Mamluk ruler of Egypt. His ambassadors, who offered the usual alter native of submission or war, had, on the advice of Baibars, Qutuz's commander-in-chief and successor (1260-77), been summarily executed, and the Egyptians had invaded Syria to gain a decisive victory over the Mongols. Crushing the forward post at Gaza they were able, thanks to the benevolent neutrality of the Franks of Acre, who had fallen foul of Ket-Buqa, to push forward along the coastline still held by the Crusaders. At Acre, revictualled by these temporary allies, they turned eastwards through Galilee towards the Jordan. The armies collided on 3 September at 'Ain Jalut near Zarin, and the Mongols were over whelmed by the superior numbers of their opponents. The heroism of Ket-Buqa is described by Rashid al-Din9 in language reminiscent of the

native saga, the Secret History of the Mongols. T h e greater part of his forces turned in flight; he refused to follow their example. In a last message to his master he declares: " Let not the Khan be distressed with the loss of a single Mongol army. Let him imagine that during one year the wives of his soldiers did not conceive and the mares in their herds did not foal." Deserted by his men he fights on until his horse stumbles and he is taken prisoner. The exchange of taunts with his captor is in true Homeric style; and in his last words, before his head is struck off, he contrasts his own faithful service of his khan with the Mamlük's rise to power by treachery and regicide. The news of Ket-Buqa's defeat and death reached Hülegü in all probability at Tabriz; it must have been shortly followed by reports of the Mongols' expulsion from the whole of Syria and their withdrawal across the Euphrates. It so happened that on the previous day Hülegü had received Naşir Yûsuf of Aleppo, on whom, in recognition of his renewed homage, he had conferred the governorship of Damascus. Doubts being now cast upon the Ayyübid's loyalty, a detachment of horsemen were dispatched to intercept him on the journey back to Syria: they overtook and massacred the whole of the party, only the astronomer Muhyi al-Din Maghribi being spared because of his profession. The re-conquest of Syria was attempted by a large force commanded either by Ilge, the ancestor of the Jalayirids, or by KökeIlge of the Uriyangqat, a kinsman of the great Sübedei. The Mongols advanced as far as Himş, where, on 10 December, they were defeated in battle by the Egyptians and, for the second time, driven back across the Euphrates. So ended the first phase in the struggle between the M o n g o l s and Mamlüks for the possession of Syria, a struggle in which the IIKhâns enjoyed the support of Armenian Cilicia and sought in vain the co-operation of Christian Europe: Öljeitü, the great grandson of Hülegü and the penultimate ruler (1304-16) of the dynasty, still hoped for some such united action against the common foe.
Hülegü's attention was now diverted to his northern frontier. The causes of the war with Berke, the ruler of the Golden Horde (1257-66), are variously given. Berke is represented by some authorities as the defender of Islam and as reproaching Hülegü for his devastation of so many Muslim countries and particularly for the execution of the caliph. It is more likely that the heirs of Jochi felt their rights endangered by the establishment of a Mongol kingdom in Persia. Arrân and Âzarbâijân, which had been incorporated in that kingdom, had already been

trodden by " the hoof of Tartar horse in the reign of Chingiz-Khan and were therefore, according to the Conqueror's directions, part of the jurt or appanage of Jochi. T h e casus belli seems to have been the death, in apparently suspicious circumstances, of the three Jochid princes, Balaghai, Tutar and Quli, who had accompanied Hulegii to Persia. Balaghai, according to Rashid al-Din, in one place,2 Tutar in an other,3 had been accused and convicted of sorcery, a capital offence with the Mongols, and had been sent to Berke as the head of his ulus. T h e latter, satisfied as to his guilt, had sent him back to Hulegii, who had carried out the sentence. The crime, as attributed to Balaghai, had taken place as early as 1256 or 1257, the execution (of Tutar) on 2 February 1260. The other two princes, Tutar (or Balaghai) and Quli, were alleged to have been poisoned. After the death of the princes their troops fled, some by way o f Darband to the territory of the Golden H o r d e , others by way of Khurasan to the Ghazna region, led by a general called Nigudar (Nigiider), whence the name of Nigudaris by which they were afterwards to be known. T h e flight of these troops was apparently consequent upon a battle fought at some time in Shawwal 660/AugustSeptember 1262. It was at about the same time, on 2 Shawwal/ 20 August, that Hiilegu. set out from Ala-Tagh to meet Berke's army, which, led by the famous general Noqai (a kinsman, as Rashid al-Din4 is careful to point out, of the dead Tutar), had advanced southwards through Darband and encamped in the region of Shirvan to the south of the south-eastern spur of the Caucasian range. Hiilegii's advanced forces made contact with the army at Shamakhi in Dhu'l-Hij ja/OctoberNovember and suffered some kind of defeat. Berke's men must never theless have retreated, for on 29 Dhu'l-Hijja/14 November they were in contact once again with these forward troops near Shabaran in the region of the present-day Kuba, well to the north of the mountains. This time victory went to the Persian Mongols, and Noqai himself was put to flight. O n 20 N o v e m b e r Hulegii advanced from Shamakhi at the head of the main army; Darband was taken by storm on 8 December and Noqai's forces routed for the second time on the 15 th. Hiilegii's triumph was, however, short-lived. A force under the nominal com mand of Hiilegii's son and successor Abaqa was sent in pursuit of the fleeing army. Crossing the Terek they came upon their deserted but well-stocked encampment, where they feasted and caroused for three

days before being attacked by Berke in person at the head of a great army. The battle raged all day (13 January 1263), and when the Persian Mongols, overwhelmed by their opponents' superior numbers, were withdrawing across the frozen Terek the ice gave way under their weight and many were drowned. Abaqa got back in safety to Shabaran, and the victorious Berke, after chasing his defeated enemies to the south of Darband, returned into his own territory, leaving Hiilegii to retire in discomfiture to Tabriz, where he arrived on 23 March. H e began elaborate preparations for the renewal of the campaign against the Golden Horde, but in the event it was his son and successor Abaqa who liquidated the war with Berke. Hiilegii had also in these last years of his reign to cope with rebellious vassals. The faithful Badr al-Din L u l u ' of Mosul had died in 1261 at an age of 96 lunar years, and his son Salih had entered into relations with the Mamluk ruler Baibars. The Il-Khan was warned of these activities by Salih's own wife, a daughter of Sultan Jalal al-Din brought up by the Mongols, and an army was dispatched against Mosul. During a siege which seems to have lasted a full year an attempt was made by Baibars to relieve the town with Syrian troops: it fell in July or August 1262, the inhabitants being massacred and Salih himself, at Hulegii's express orders, subjected to a lingering death by a particularly loath some form of torture. With the execution of Salih's infant son every memory of the dynasty founded in 1127 by 'Imad al-Din Zangi, the great champion of Islam against the Crusaders, was finally extinguished. In Fars, meanwhile, another old vassal, the Atabeg Abu. Bakr (1226-60) had died, and the behaviour of his third successor, Saljuq-Shah (12624), led to the intervention of a M o n g o l army. Saljuq-Shah fled to Kazarun, where he was captured and killed, and Hiilegii bestowed the throne upon Princess Abish, a grand-daughter of Abu. Bakr, whom he gave in marriage to his eleventh son, Mengu-Temiir (1256-82): she was the last of the Salghurids.
Hiilegii died on 8 February 1265 in his winter quarters on the Jaghatu (the present-day Zarineh Riid), one of the four rivers which discharge into Lake Reza'iyeh from the south: he was in his 49th year. He was laid to rest in the castle on the island of Shahi where his treasures were stored, his grave being the traditional Royal Tomb of the Northern peoples: this is the last occasion on which human victims are recorded as having been buried with a Chingizid prince. His death was shortly followed (17 June 1265) by that of his chief wife, Doquz



HÜLEGÜ
Khatun, the niece of the Kereit ruler Ong-Khan, to whose influence is to be largely attributed his benevolent attitude towards the Christians. The achievements of Hülegü as a conqueror and empire-builder have not perhaps been fully appreciated. In either capacity he will bear com parison with his cousin Batu or his brother Qubilai, the founders respectively of the Golden Horde and the Yuan dynasty. Having destroyed both the 'Abbâsid Caliphate and its Ismâ'ill opponents he extended the Mongol conquests to the shores of the Mediterranean and left to his successors dominion (subject, nominally, to the Great Khan) over a territory corresponding to the greater part of what we now call the Middle East. It is, however, not for nothing that we speak of the Il-Khâns of Persia, just as to William A d a m Hülegü was imperator Persidis.1 T h e M o n g o l was, in fact, mutatis mutandis as much E m p e r o r of Iran as the Norman William was King of England. He and his successors created at least the pre-conditions for a national state; Iran ceased to be a mere geographical expression, and its rulers, for the first time since late antiquity, entered into direct diplomatic relations with the West. The dynasty founded by Hülegü may be said to have paved the way, however unwittingly, for the centralizing and nationalistic policies of the Şafavids.
ABAQA
Immediately upon Hülegü's death the roads were closed, in accordance with the Mongol custom, and a ban laid on all movement from place to place. Summoned from his winter-quarters in Mâzandarân Abaqa, the Il-Khân's eldest son and heir-apparent and the most obvious candi date for the throne, did not in fact present himself until 9 March. Another candidate, his younger brother Yoshmut, had arrived on the Jaghatu only a week after his father's death but, realizing his lack of support, had returned almost at once to his post on the northern frontier at Darband. Abaqa, upon his arrival, was received with respect and deference and, the mourning ceremonies once completed, was, by the unanimous decision of the assembled princes and amirs, invited to ascend the throne. In accepting, after the conventional show of hesitance, he stipulated that his election should first have the sanction of the Great Khan. The ceremony of enthronement took place on 19 June, a date selected as auspicious by Naşir al-Din Tüsï, on the shores of the Chaghan Na'ur ("White Lake"), the modern Tualâ, in the

Farahan district to the north of Sultanabad (Arak). Here the new Il-Khan proceeded to appoint his commanders and officials: Shams alDin Juvaini, chosen as vizier by his father, was retained in that office, while his brother, the historian, whom Hulegu had made governor of Baghdad, now became lieutenant to the noyan Suqunchaq, the viceroy of 'Iraq-i 'Arab and Fars. For his capital Abaqa chose Tabriz in preference to Maragheh favoured by his father; his summer residences he fixed at Ala-Tagh and Siyah-Kiih (the range which forms the water shed between the Jaghatu and the Qizil Uzun) and his winter resi dences in Baghdad, Arran and the warm valley of the Jaghatu. Hostilities with the Golden Horde were resumed at the very com mencement of Abaqa's reign. On 19 July 1265 Yoshmut advanced northwards against Noqai, who had invaded the Il-Khan's territory at the head of a large army. In a fierce battle fought on the Aq-Su, a river descending into Shirvan from the southern slopes of the Caucasus, N o q a i was wounded and put to flight. Abaqa now followed his brother over the K u r to collide with Berke at the head of 300,000 horse; he recrossed the river and for a fortnight the two armies faced each other across the water, exchanging volleys of arrows. In search of a crossing Berke proceeded upstream towards Tiflis; he died en route, his body was carried back to Sarai for burial and his leaderless troops dispersed to their homes. As a kind of Hadrian's Wall along his northern frontier Abaqa caused a great sibe or palisade to be erected along the left bank of the Kur, a day's journey in length according to Haithon,1 a deep moat being dug between the sibe and the river. Leaving his brother Mengii-Temur with a mixed force of Mongols and Muslims to defend these fortifications the Il-Khan set out for Khurasan, passing the winter of 1266-7 in various encampments in Mazandaran and Gurgan. It was during this winter, or perhaps a year or two later, that Abaqa was visited by Mas'ud Beg, the son of the celebrated Muhammad Yalavach and the governor of the whole agricultural zone of Central Asia from the Uighur country westwards. The object of this visit was ostensibly to collect revenues due to Baraq, the ruler (1266-71) of the Chaghatai Khanate, and to his eastern neighbour Qaidu, of whom Baraq was first a rival and then a satellite; but the real purpose of Mas'ud Beg's journey was to spy out the land for Baraq, who had been encouraged by Qaidu in his plans for invading the territories of Abaqa.
1 P. 336. He takes Cyba (Ciba), i.e. sibe, to be the name of a place in the vicinity of the wall.



ABAQA
357
A day after Mas'ud's departure the news was received of the appearance of a hostile army on the Oxus. The Il-Khan dispatched a party to apprehend him, but he eluded their pursuit and crossed the Oxus just as they reached the left bank. In the course of another embassy to Abaqa (apparently in the winter of 1267-8, when the Il-Khan was again in Mazandaran and Gurgan) the emissaries of Baraq presented Prince Tegiider, a grandson of Chaghatai who had led a contingent westward under Hiilegu, with a special kind of arrow known as toghana, dis creetly indicating that there was a message hidden inside it. In the message Baraq apprised his kinsman of his intention and appealed for his co-operation. Returning to his fief in Georgia Tegiider, after consulting with his amirs, decided to make his way into Baraq's territory by way of Darband. The Il-Khan's suspicions had by now been aroused, and the noyan Shiremiin, the son of Chormaghun, was sent in his pursuit; finding the passage through Darband barred, he returned to Georgia, still pursued by Shiremiin, hid for a while in a great forest, was overtaken and defeated in battle and finally, in the autumn of 1269, surrendered to Abaqa. He was imprisoned for a year on an island in Lake Urmiyeh and then released after Baraq's defeat. Until his death, though not perhaps restored to favour, he enjoyed free access to the Il-Khan's court. The story of his revolt is told with many curious details in the Georgian Chronicle1 and in the History of the Nation of the Archers of the Armenian Grigor.2 Tegiider's name has often been misread as Nigiider (Nigudar) and has in consequence been connected with the Nigudaris, who, as we have seen, were in fact the troops of the Jochid princes Tutar and Quli.
Baraq's first hostile m o v e was to demand that Tubshin, Abaqa's younger brother and commander in Khurasan and Mazandaran, should evacuate the meadowlands of Badghis, which he claimed, along with the territories stretching southwards to the Indus, to be the hereditary property of his own ulus. It was only after an exchange of angry messages with Tubshin and Abaqa himself that he moved his forces towards the Oxus. Qaidu, to whom he had appealed for assistance, had sent, according to Vassaf,3 a whole host of princes to swell his army; but Rashid al-Din mentions only two, Qipchaq and Chabat, a grandson and great grandson respectively of the Great Khan Ogedei. The Chaghatai princes crossed the river in the spring of 1270 and advanced to Marii

chaq, where Tiibshin was awaiting them. Qaidu, who saw himself in the role of tertiusgaudens in this conflict, had instructed his two kinsmen, according to Rashid al-Din,1 to find some pretext for withdrawing their forces upon the first contact with Tiibshin, and this they contrived to do, to Baraq's no small embarrassment. Tiibshin, who was accompanied by the veteran Arghun Aqa, seems nevertheless to have been unequal to opposing the invader and retired into Mazandaran to await the approach of his brother at the head of the main army. Abaqa set out from Mianeh in Azarbaijan on 27 April 1270. The crops were beginning to come up and the Il-Khan, so Rashid al-Din2 tells us, " o u t of his perfect justice" forbade his troops to harm even a single ear. In the great plain between Abhar and Zanjan, which the Mongols called Qongqur-Oleng (" Brown Meadow ") and where Oljeitii afterwards built his capital Sultaniyeh, he was met by an ambassador from the Great Khan, a man called Tekechiik, who had been detained by Baraq, had managed to escape and was able to inform Abaqa of the conditions prevailing in the enemy's camp. The Il-Khan accelerated his pace and, passing through Ray, was welcomed by Tiibshin and Arghun Aqa in Qiimis. They proceeded together to the meadows of Radkan, where Abaqa distributed largesse to the troops and presents to the amirs, and from thence by way of Bakharz into Badghis. Abaqa, whose patrols had already made contact with Baraq's forces, now sent an emissary to offer terms of peace. Baraq was in the Taliqan area, which he had made his headquarters. Despite the defection of Qipchaq and Chabat he had succeeded in conquering the greater part of Khurasan. On 1 9 May 1270 his troops had attacked and pillaged the town of Nishapiir, razed to the ground by their forebears nearly fifty years before, but had vacated it the next day. He had also meditated a similar attack on Herat but had been persuaded of the unwisdom of such an action and had sought instead to win over the allegiance of the ruler of Herat, the Malik Shams al-Din Kart. The latter was rescued from an embarrassing position by the news of the approach of Abaqa at the head of a great army; he withdrew into his castle to wait upon events. The terms which Abaqa's emissary transmitted to Baraq were generous enough. In return for the cessation of hostilities the Il-Khan offered to cede the territory stretching from Badghis southwards to the Indus. One at least of Baraq's amirs was in favour of accepting these terms, but he was overruled by the bellicose majority and, despite the

warning of Baraq's astrologer, it was decided to launch an immediate attack. Doubt had been cast on the actual presence of Abaqa in Khurasan, and it was suggested that this was a false report put about by Tubshin and Arghun Aqa for their own ends. Accordingly three scouts were sent on ahead to ascertain the facts. They were captured by Abaqa's men on the very spot that had been selected for the battlefield. This was a broad plain at the foot of the mountains with a river, which the M o n g o l s called Qara Su, flowing in front of it. Brought before Abaqa the scouts were soon intimidated into declaring the nature of their mission; and the Il-Khan conceived the idea of deceiving the enemy by means of their own spies. Leaving his tent for a moment he gave the necessary instructions to one of his men. He then returned to resume the drinking bout with his generals, the three scouts remaining, as heretofore, bound to the tent pole. An hour or two later the officer whom he had so instructed entered in the guise of a courier to declare, with simulated agitation, that Abaqa's territories had been invaded by a great army from the Golden Horde and that all was lost unless the Il-Khan returned immediately. Affecting to believe this message Abaqa ordered his forces to abandon the camp and baggage and leave for Mazandaran that very night. At the moment of departure he detailed an officer to execute the three scouts but told him sotto voce to let one escape. As the army passed Herat the governor was ordered to close the gates of the town to Baraq; they halted at the place chosen for the battlefield which Rashid al-Din here calls Dasht-i China, perhaps the Plain of the Wolf (Mongol china " w o l f " ) .
Meanwhile the sole surviving scout had made off post-haste to bear the imagined good tidings to Baraq. Elated with the news the Chaghatai army advanced westwards the next morning in pursuit, as they thought, of a fleeing army. T h e Heratis had closed their gates as ordered but Baraq, though angered by their action, was in no mood to turn aside from the chase. Crossing the Hari Rud the troops beheld the deserted encampment spread out before them and fell gleefully to pillaging it. Finally sated with plunder they halted to the south of Herat and passed the remainder of the day in feasting and revelry. The next day they continued the advance westwards along the river and had ridden for about two hours when they suddenly emerged on to a broad plain covered from end to end with Abaqa's men. Baraq drew up his forces on the river bank, to meet, as best he could, the Il-Khan's attack. Despite the advantage of surprise all did not at first g o in Abaqa's

favour, and his left wing was driven back as far as Püşhang (on the site of the modern Ghurian); but their pursuers were thrown into disarray, and, with the third charge of Abaqa's army, the enemy broke before them. Baraq's horse was killed beneath him and he escaped across the Oxus on the mount of one of his guards; he was accompanied by only 5,000 of his men, whose losses would have been even greater but for rear-guard action on the part of Jalayirtai, the same general who had driven back Abaqa's left wing. The Battle of Herat (as it may be called) was fought on 22 July 1270: henceforth, apart from the incursions of Esen-Buqa and Yasa'ur in the reign of Öljeitü, the eastern frontiers of Iran were to remain comparatively inviolate until the rise of Timur. Leaving Tiibshin in command of Khurasan and Mazandaran the Il-Khân returned to Azarbaijan, reaching Marâgheh on 18 October and the ordus of his wives in the Jaghatu valley on 6 November. Here he received the ambassadors of the Great Khan, the bearers of a yarligh conferring upon him the Khanate of Iran; and here, in accordance with that yarligh, the ceremony of enthronement was performed for a second time on 26 November. It is now that we hear for the last time of Naşir al-Dîn Tüsî. During a hunting expedition in the Jaghatu valley the Îl-Khân had been gored by a bison (gâv~i kübî). T h e primitive first aid of an attendant had stopped the bleeding, but the wound suppurated and an abscess was formed which none of Abaqa's physicians dared to open. Naşir al-Din gave it as his opinion that the operation could be performed without danger; and the lancing was successfully carried out, under his supervision, by a Muslim surgeon. The great philo sopher died four years later in Baghdad and Raşhid al-Din1 records some curious details about the circumstances of his burial. His scientific work has been dealt with elsewhere in this volume. A true disciple of Avicenna, " h e held fast"—in the words of Barhebraeus,2 a Christian col laborator at Marâgheh—" to the opinions of the early philosophers, and he combated vigorously in his writing those who contradicted them". In the following decade the Il-Khân himself took little or no part in military operations. In 1 2 7 1 there was an echo from the past when the Isma'ili castle of Gird-Küh finally surrendered. It had withstood a continuous siege o f eighteen years, having been first invested by K e t Buqa in May 1 2 5 3. In Transoxiana, which remained without an effective ruler from the death of Baraq (9 August 1270) till the accession of his son Du'a (1282), Abaqa was able to avenge himself for the invasion of

Khurasan. In the course of a campaign ( 1 2 7 2 - 3 ) suggested and partially led by a renegade Chaghatai officer, Bukhara was sacked and burnt and as a result of this and subsequent troubles remained depopulated for seven years. Only in Asia Minor was Abaqa called upon to intervene in person. Of the two sultans of Rum Kai-Ka'us II was now an exile in the Crimea and Qilich-Arslan IV had been put to death by his vizier Mu'in al-Din Sulaiman, better known as the Parvana {Sahib Parvana, " Keeper of the Seals"). Though Qilich-Arslan's infant son was the titular ruler the administration of the country was and remained in the hands of the Parvana. That he was in correspondence with the Mamluks seems indisputable; whether he authorized the deputation of Rumi notables (including, according to Rashid al-Din, his own son) who in 1 2 7 6 invited Baibars to attempt the conquest of Rum is not so clear. The invitation was in any case accepted and, in the spring of 1277, the Mamluk sultan invaded the territory of the Saljuqs, inflicted a crushing defeat on the Mongol army of occupation at Abulustan (the modern Albustan) on the Upper Jaihan (15 April), made a triumphal entry into Qaisariyya (Kayseri) a week later and then, with equal rapidity, withdrew into his own territory. News of this disaster was brought to Abaqa at Tabriz, and he set out forthwith for Asia Minor. At Abulustan he inspected the battlefield, and shed tears over the piles of Mongol dead; then angered with the lukewarmness of his Saljuq allies, he gave orders for the devastation of an area stretching from Qaisariyya to Erzerum, calling a halt to the rapine and slaughter only upon the intercession of his vizier the sahib-divan Shams al-Din Juvaini. It was at first his intention to enter Syria in pursuit of Baibars but, convinced of the difficulties of military operation in the height of summer, he postponed till the following winter a campaign which in the event was not to be launched till the autumn of 1 2 8 1 . He spent the remainder of the summer in AlaTagh, whither the Parvana, who had discreetly withdrawn to Tuqat (Tokat) during the hostilities, was brought for trial. His guilt established, he was put to death on 2 August 1277. There is perhaps some truth in Haithon's1 story that his body was cut up and eaten in some sort of cannibalistic ritual. Some weeks after the execution of the Parvana the sahib-divan was sent to restore peace and order in the Saljuq territories. This task completed we find him in the Darband area pacifying the mountain tribes of what

is now Daghestan, "peoples", says Rashid al-Din,1 "that have never been subdued by anyone in any period". It was at this time, about the year 1 2 7 7 , that the great minister was first exposed to the machinations of rivals seeking to encompass his downfall. Of these the most dangerous and persistent was a certain Majd al-Mulk, a former protege of Shams al-Din. On the basis of some chance remarks by one Majd al-Din, a confidant of the sahib-divan's brother 'Ala' al-Din, he accused both brothers of being in league with the Mamlûks. The accusation was made in a statement to Yesù-Buqa, a son-in-law of Hulegu, and in due course was brought to the notice of Abaqa, who ordered an inquiry. The unfortunate Majd al-Din was put to the question but refused to make any admission of guilt, so that Majd al-Mulk was not able to press the charge. However, three years later in the spring of 1279, he succeeded in gaining access to Prince Arghun, Abaqa's elder son and second successor ( 1 2 8 4 - 9 1 ) , and convincing him not only that the sâhib-divàn was in treasonable correspondence with the Egyptians but also that he had embezzled huge sums from the Treasury. Arghun repeated these accusations to his father, who did not, however, take any action until he had himself been approached by Majd al-Mulk in the spring of the following year. It was only through the intercession of one of the royal ladies that Shams al-Din was saved from the Il-Khân's wrath, though Abaqa's suspicions do not seem to have been entirely allayed and the sâhib-divân was not fully restored to favour. Against Shams al-Din's brother 'Alà' al-Din, the historian and governor of Baghdad, the intrigues of Majd al-Mulk were more successful: he was twice arrested and was actually being taken to Hamadân for trial at the time of Abaqa's death. The Il-Khân's plans for an attack on Syria, for which, as we shall see, he had long been seeking an alliance with the powers of the Christian West, were interrupted by a threat from an unexpected quarter. In the winter of 1 2 7 8 - 9 a force of Nigudaris or Qaraunas (as they called them selves and are called by Marco Polo) invaded Kirmàn and Fârs from their base in southern Afghanistan. Rashid al-Din's2 and Vassaf's3 accounts of these operations are difficult to reconcile ; the latter authority writes in much greater detail and speaks of a second campaign three years later in which the invaders penetrated to the shores of the Persian Gulf. The present incursion seems to have little more than a large-scale

raid, from which they returned, with their prisoners and booty, to the region of Sistan. Here in the town of the same name (the earlier Zarang) they were besieged by Prince Arghun in the summer (July-August) of 1279; they offered but slight resistance and, upon the surrender of the town, their leaders, including a grandson of the Chaghatai khan Mubarak-Shah (1266) were taken to Herat, where they paid homage to Abaqa (12 August 1279). The ruler or commander of these freebooters was until 698/1298-9 a great-grandson of Chaghatai called 'Abdallah, a convert (as his name indicates) to Islam. He was then recalled by the Chaghatai khan Du'a (1282-1306) and replaced by the latter's son, Qutlugh-Khwaja, under whom in 1300 the Nigudaris launched yet another attack upon Fars, an action, says Rashid al-Din,1 on which they would not have ventured but for the preoccupation of Ghazan's forces in Syria. T o Syria Abaqa was now at last able to give his full attention. He had been in correspondence with the pope since 1267 (and apparently earlier); in 1273 he had written both to the pope and to Edward I of England. In the following year his envoys had repeated the message at the Council of Lyons; in 1276 they were in Italy and in 1277 in England. T o these appeals for an alliance against a common enemy Abaqa had received no positive reply, and he decided to act alone. In September 1281 an army of some 40,000 men under the command of the Il-Khan's brother Mengu-Temur entered Syria by way of 'Ain Tab. As in Hulegu's invasion twenty years earlier, the King of Little Armenia, now Het'um's son Leon III, had contributed his contingent of troops. The clash with the Egyptians occurred near Hims on 30 October. The battle is described in the greatest detail by the Egyptian historians; Rashid alDin, writing for Ghazan and Oljeitu, is naturally disinclined to dwell upon a humiliating defeat of their grandfather's forces. The Mongol right wing, composed of Oirats, Armenians and Georgians, drove back their opponents to the gates of Hims, but in the centre, Mengu-Temiir, a young and inexperienced commander, was wounded by an Egyptian officer and turning in flight was followed by the greater part of his army. He recrossed the Euphrates with such of his forces as had not drowned in the river or died of thirst in the desert and made for his mother's apanage in Upper Mesopotamia.

After Abaqa's death the royal ladies, the princes of the blood and the great amirs gathered together in Maragheh to observe the usual ceremonies of mourning; they then proceeded to the Jaghatu valley to elect his successor. Of the two candidates for the throne Teguder, Hiilegii's seventh and eldest surviving son, was the more strongly supported, and the other candidate, Abaqa's eldest son Arghun, was persuaded to stand down in his favour.

campaign, he had chosen to remain to the east of the Euphrates, engaged apparently on a large-scale hunting expedition, first on the K h a b u r and then on the Euphrates opposite Rahbat al-Sham: fighting broke out with the inhabitants, though Rashid al-Din1 specifically mentions that t n e Il-Khan did not cross the river. On 15 October he turned back towards Sinjar and on the 30th rejoined his ordus in the vicinity of Mosul. He was extremely angry with the news, declaring that those responsible would be called to account in a quriltai to be held the next summer and that he would then take the field in person to avenge his brother's defeat. He was to be denied this satisfaction. After passing the greater part of the winter in Baghdad (it was during this period that 'Ala' al-Din Juvaini was arrested, released and re-arrested) he set out for Hamadan, where he arrived on 18 March 1282 and where, after a bout of heavy drinking, he died in a state of delirium tremens on 1 April. He was laid to rest alongside his father on the island of Shahi. " K h u l a g u and A b a k a " , says H o worth,2 " w e r e two important figures in Asiatic history. They conquered and controlled a vast empire with vigour and prudence. Their successors, until we reach the reign of Ghazan, were for the most part weak and decrepit rulers, whose authority was gradually disintegrating. Had it not, in fact, been for the utter desolation and prostration caused by the campaigns of Jingis and Khulagu in Persia, they would undoubtedly have been driven out and displaced; and, as it was, a very little more aggressive vigour on the part of the Egyptian rulers who controlled the various forces of Islam would no doubt have led to the collapse of the empire of the Ilkhans." It is certainly true that not until the accession of Ghazan was the Il-Khanid state ruled by a prince capable of reviving and continuing the policies of Hiilegii and Abaqa.



TEGÛDER (AHMAD)
1282, apparently still in the winter residence on the Jaghatu; but the actual enthronement took place in Ala-Tagh more than a month later, on 21 June. As a convert to Islam (it is not known of how long standing) he assumed the name of Ahmad and the title of sultan. It was at Ala-Tagh that cAla' al-Din Juvaini was cleared of Majd al-Mulk's charges and reinstated in the governorship of Baghdad, whilst his accuser, condemned in turn, was lynched by the mob before the death sentence could be carried out. His brother, the sâhib-divân, was likewise fully restored to favour, and it was at his advice that Tegûder now sought to establish friendly relations with the sultan of Egypt, a step diametrically opposed, as he admits himself in his letter to Qïla'un, to the wishes of his fellow princes, who at the quriltai just concluded had unanimously resolved upon the resumption of hostilities with the Mamluks. The embassy which set out from Ala-Tagh on 25 August was coolly received. A mission in the following year fared even worse. The ambassador and his staff were cast into prison, where the former actually died. He could in any case have accomplished nothing for the delivery of his message had been anticipated by the news of Teguder's dethronement and death. Relations between the khan and his disappointed rival had rapidly deteriorated. Much of the latter's animus was directed against Teguder's proteges, the Juvaini brothers, particularly Shams al-Din, whom he accused—and the charge seems to have been widely believed—of having poisoned his father. The winter of 1282-3 n e s P e n t m Baghdad, where he revived the old charge of embezzlement against cAlâ' al-Din, whose agents he arrested and put to the torture : he caused the body of one man, who had recently died, to be exhumed and flung upon the highway. News of these activities reached 'Ala' al-Din in Arrân and brought on a stroke: he died on 5 March 1283. In the spring Arghun returned from Baghdad to Khurasan, of which his father had made him viceroy and where he now began to prepare for open rebellion against Tegûder. He had an ally and perhaps a rival in his uncle Prince Qongqurtai, the ninth son of Hiilegu and viceroy of Rum. In Arrân, where he was in attendance on Tegûder, Qongqurtai formed, or was said to have formed, a conspiracy to seize the khan's person during the celebration of the Mongol New Year falling in January 1284. He was arrested by Teguder's son-in-law, the Georgian general Alinaq, on 1 7 January and executed on the following day; and with Qongqurtai out of the way the khan at once moved against his fellow conspirator Arghun.

an army of 100,000 men now at his disposal he dispatched, on 29 Janu ary, an advanced force of 15,000 horse under the command of Alinaq; he himself, at the head of the main army, set out from Pil-Suvar in Mughan on 26 April. On the 31st he received news of the approach of Arghun's army and instructed Alinaq to offer battle if his forces were superior in number but otherwise to await his own arrival. There was a clash between the advance parties of either army at Khail-i Buzurg between Qazvin and Ray, and a pitched battle was fought at AqKhwaja (Sumghan) to the south of Qazvin on 4 May. Though the result seems on the whole to have been a victory for Arghun, he saw fit to withdraw eastwards, and the khan's forces continued to advance. At Aq-Khwaja Tegiider received a deputation bearing a conciliatory message from Arghun. Against the advice of his generals he rejected these overtures and pressed onwards. A second deputation headed by Prince Ghazan, the future Il-Khan, reached him in the Simnan area on 31 May. His reply was that Arghun should demonstrate his sincerity either by presenting himself in person or by sending his brother Geikhatu. This message he caused to be delivered by a deputation of princes and amirs, one of whom, Buqa, was secretly in sympathy with Arghun. Despite an undertaking made to Buqa that, as a conciliatory gesture, he would halt at Khurqan, Tegiider advanced to a place called Kalpush to the north of Jajarm, where it had been Arghun's intention to make a stand. At Kalpush, on 28 June, he was rejoined by his ambassadors bringing with them Prince Geikhatu and two of Arghun's amirs, one of them the famous Nauruz. B u q a was annoyed to find that Tegiider had not kept his word; he ventured to argue with the khan, who expressed his displeasure by the use of threatening language and by deposing him from his office. As the result of this treatment Buqa became, in Rashid al-Din's1 words, "still more ardent a partisan of Arghun" with the direst consequences to Tegiider. Meanwhile, at Quchan, which he reached on 7 July, the Il-Khan learnt that Arghun, with only a small following, had taken refuge in the famous mountain stronghold of Kalat (the later Kalat-i Nadiri). Approached by Alinaq at the head of Teguder's advanced forces he was persuaded to come down from the castle and surrender to his uncle ( 1 1 July 1284). Tegiider, after receiving him with apparent kindness, handed him over to Alinaq to be kept under guard until such time as he could be tried in the presence of the khan's mother, Princess Qutui. Then, conceiving a

desire for the company of his most recently married wife, he set out for his oghruq or base camp at Kâlpüşh, leaving Alinaq in charge of the prisoner and the princes in command of the army. Buqa availed himself of his opportunity. Arghun was released, and Alinaq killed; and, with the co-operation of the princes and commanders favourable to Arghun, all supporters of Tegiider had soon been eliminated. " A t night", says Raşhid al-Din,1 "Arghun was a prisoner, and in the morning he was monarch of the face of the earth." N e w s of this reversal of his fortunes reached Tegiider while still en route to Kâlpüşh. H e halted for a brief space and then, on 10 July, fled westwards along the great Khurasan road. Within three days he was in Qongqur-Oleng, where he looted Buqa's ordu and was only restrained by the Amir Suqunchaq from harming his wife and family. On 17 July he reached his own ordus, probably in Soghurluq (in Turkish "the place abounding in marmots"), the Mongols' summer residence at Shiz (Takht-i-Sulaimân), the site of the famous fire-temple.2 It was his intention to make for Darband and escape into the territory of the Golden Horde; but messengers arriving from Arghun with news of his changed circumstances, he was placed under close arrest by the officers in charge of the ordus. It was at this juncture that a band of Qaraunas, whom Buqa had caused to be dispatched in his pursuit, burst into the camp, which they pillaged with an indiscriminate savagery graphically described by Vaşşâf:3 "nothing was left", says Raşhid al-Din,4 "save the ashes in the fire-places." They took Tegiider into their own custody handing him over to Arghun when, on 26 July, he arrived in the ordus. At a place called Âb-i-Şhür ("Salt Water") near Yüz Aghaçh (in Turkish "Hundred Trees"), an unidentified summer residence some where in the Üjân region, Tegüder was brought to trial, the main charge being the execution of Qongqurtai. He expressed contrition for his past actions, and Arghun himself was in favour of clemency, but the protests of Qongqurtai's family and the possibility of a rising in flamadan prevailed upon him to pass the death sentence. It was carried out on 10 August 1284: as in the case of his victim Qongqurtai his back was broken, a form of execution designed, like the use of the bowstring, to avoid the shedding of royal blood. There is little or no evidence to support Howorth's5 contention that

HISTORY OF THE IL-KHANS
his death " was mainly due to his patronage of Muhammedanism, which set against him the conservative feeling, both political and religious, of the Mongol chieftains". His overtures to the Mamluks might well have offended national susceptibilities but can hardly have been widely known of during his lifetime. In patronizing the Juvainis he merely followed the example of his shamanist or Buddhist father and brother. Like them he was, according to Barhebraeus,1 favourably disposed towards the Christian sects; and Rashid al-Din2 specifically mentions his employment of Georgian and Armenian troops in his campaign against Arghun. He does not, in short, despite the contrary testimony of Haithon,3 give the impression of a bigoted convert to Islam; and his downfall was probably due, not to an active or passive religious policy, but simply, as afterwards in the cases of his nephews Geikhatu and Baidu, to his ineffectiveness as a ruler.
ARGHUN
The enthronement of Arghun followed closely upon the execution of his uncle; it took place, according to Rashid al-Din,4 on the next day, i.e. I I August 1284. Only the royal ladies and the amirs were present, the princes, Arghun's brothers, cousins and uncles, having not yet arrived. Rashid al-Din,5 it is true, speaks of his uncle Hulachu as playing a leading part in the ceremony; but this is probably an anachronistic reference to the second ceremony, held on 7 April 1286, after Arghun's accession had been officially sanctioned by the Great Khan. At the time of the first ceremony Hulachu still saw himself as a rival candidate for the throne; it was only at the quriltai held in the spring or summer of 1285 that he was reconciled with his nephew and accepted, jointly with Arghun's brother Geikhatu, the viceroyalty of Rum. At the same quriltai Arghun's son Ghazan received the provinces of Khurasan, Mazandaran, Qumis and Ray. Buqa's services had been recognized much earlier. Already in the autumn of 1284 Arghun had appointed him his vizier and, as a more spectacular demonstration of his gratitude, had caused gold to be poured over him until he was all but buried in the pile. Buqa's predecessor, Shams al-Din Juvaini, fared very dif ferently. After his master's downfall he had made his way first to Isfahan and then to Qum, from whence he had been urged to escape to

ARQHUN
India by way of Hurmuz. However, reassured by the proclamation of a general amnesty, he decided to throw himself on the mercy of the new khan. Arghun was then at Qurban Shire (in M o n g o l " Three Thrones " ) , somewhere in the vicinity of Soghurluq. Here Shams al-Din arrived on 23 September 1284, and through the good offices of Buqa, with whom he had previously been on friendly terms, he was appointed the latter's deputy. This improvement in his fortunes was of very brief duration; the victim of intriguers, who had once been his proteges, he was put to death at the gates of Ahar on 1 6 October 1284. Such was the end of the great minister, whose role under the Il-Khans may be compared, not unaptly, with that of Nizam al-Mulk under the Saljuqs. Barhebraeus,1 an observer certainly not prejudiced in his favour, bears witness that "the whole kingdom of the House of M a g h o g h [i.e. M a g o g , the Mongols] hung on his finger, for he was very sagacious with an understanding nature; and he was well instructed in the greater number of the sciences and the various kinds of learning". His successor's term of office lasted little more than four years. His arrogance soon raised him enemies; their numbers increased as the result of his activities in Fars (still nominally ruled by Princess Abish), where he had been sent to restore order after a popular rising against the Mongols; and perceiving that he had lost the khan's favour he became involved in a conspiracy in which several of the princes seem to have been implicated. Betrayed by Arghun's cousin Jiishkeb, who had affected an interest in the plot in order to obtain the names of the conspirators, Buqa was put to death on 16 January 1289. He was succeeded as vizier by a Jewish physician, Sacd al-Daula of Abhar, "the most influential Jew not only of Azerbaijan but of Persia as a whole, after Mordecai and Esther, and after Ezra and Nehemiah, ever to play a role in the political arena of P e r s i a " . 2 Sacd al-Daula had first w o n the Il-Khan's confidence as a financial administrator, when sent to Baghdad to restore the economy after the large-scale peculations of Buqa and his brother Aruq. A man of pleasing address conversant with both the Turkish and the Mongol languages, he so ingratiated himself with Arghun that the latter, in June 1289, bestowed upon him the vizierate of his Empire. The rule of a Jew over a predominantly Muslim com munity must of itself have caused widespread resentment, and such resentment was naturally aggravated by his practising the usual nepotism of his age and time and distributing the key posts in the

administration amongst his relations and co-religionists. Nevertheless even a hostile witness such as Vassaf is constrained to admit that Sa'd al-Daula "established the administration on the basis of law and justice; that his reforms led to the disappearance of oppression, robbery and thieving, to security and facilitation of the pilgrimage to Mecca; that the finances of the state were consolidated and that all the inhabitants benefited from his successful efforts".1 The story, re counted by Vassaf,2 that he contemplated founding a new religion with the khan as its prophet is probably pure invention. Despite his un popularity he retained Arghun's favour to the very end, his adversaries venturing to attack him only when the Il-Khan was on his death-bed. Though he had won his throne by the sword Arghun appears only twice to have taken the field during the course of his reign: in the spring of 1288 and again in the spring of 1290, the forces under his command repelled an invasion launched by the ruler of the Golden Horde, ToleBuqa(i287֊9i) and led by his successor Toqta ( 1 2 9 1 - 1 3 1 2 ) . These seem however to have been little more than large-scale raids. Of far greater potential danger to the Il-Khanid state was the insurrection of Nauruz, the son of Arghun Aqa, who, as military governor of Khurasan, was the second-in-command to Prince Ghazan. T h e rebellion lasted for five years (1289-94), continuing into the reign of Geikhatu: at the time of Arghun's death Ghazan was in full retreat before his former lieutenant, who proceeded to rapine and slaughter upon such a scale as Rashid al-Din3 terms "beyond description". The terror which Nauruz had inspired became proverbial, and the natives of Khurasan, when their cattle refused to drink, would say it was because they had seen his reflection in the water. Such was the instrument whereby the Il-Khans were to be brought into the fold of Islam. Like his father Arghun wished to resume the war against the Mamluks, and he too sought a military alliance with the Christian West. Already in 1285 he had sent a letter to Pope Honorius IV, of which the Latin translation has been preserved in the Vatican archives. The correspondence seems to have had the sanction of the Great Khan himself, one of whose officials, a Nestorian Christian called 'Isa Kelemechi, took part in the embassy.
And now let it be [says the Il-Khan], because the land of the Saracens is not ours, between us, good father, us who are on this side and you who are on

In 1287 a second embassy, led by a Nestorian prelate from China called Rabban Sauma, set out for Europe, returning in the following year with letters from Pope Nicholas IV, Edward I of England and Philippe le Bel of France. The last-named at least seems to have given a favour able reply, for in a letter written in the summer of 1289 Arghun refers to his promise to send troops to his aid in a forthcoming campaign against the Mamluks. He himself, he continues, would set out at the beginning of January 1291, so as to reach Damascus on 15 February. A n d he adds: " N o w if, fulfilling thy sincere word, thou sendest thy troops at the time agreed upon, and if, blessed with g o o d fortune by Heaven, we conquer these people, we shall give you Jerusalem."2 Arghun must soon have abandoned the idea of such an expedition, for we find him in September 1289 at Maragheh en route for Arran, where he passed the winter of 1289-90 and where, in the following spring, he became involved, as has already been mentioned, in a brief collision with the forces of the Golden Horde. He took a great interest in the sciences, true and false, and Rashid al-Din3 records an interview with the famous scientist Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi in the Van area, during the late summer of 1290, in which the latter showed him a map of the Mediterranean coast of what is now Turkey and answered the Il-Khan's questions about it. Arghun had on a former occasion exchanged views with Qutb al-Din on the alchemist's art, upon which and its practi tioners he had lavished large sums of money; and at Maragheh in the previous autumn he had been offered by an Indian yogi the elixir of life, in the form of an electuary compounded mainly of sulphur and mercury.4 This medicament he continued to take over a period of nearly eight months, at the end of which, having now returned to Tabriz, he retired into the castle to hold a forty-day fast in the company of Buddhist priests, apart from whom only Sa'd al-Daula and two other

favourites were admitted to his presence. In Arran, where he passed the winter of 1290-1, he was taken dangerously ill, but in response to treatment by a Muslim or Jewish physician was showing some signs of recovery, when a Buddhist priest or doctor appeared at his bedside and gave him some kind of potion which had the effect of bringing on a relapse. His illness, which now became chronic, was put down by some to the evil eye, for the aversion of which they recommended the giving of alms; the qams or shamans, on the other hand, diagnosed witch craft; and one of his ladies, who confessed under torture to having administered a love-philtre, was thrown into the river (presumably the Kur) along with a number of other women. The khan's life was now despaired of and on 16 February 1291 a group of amirs hostile to Sa'd al-Daula and Arghun's other favourites formed a conspiracy to over throw them. They were all of them seized and put to death, Sa'd alDaula himself being formally tried and executed on 5 March. His death, as was to be expected, became the signal for savage pogroms in Tabriz and Baghdad. He was survived by his master for less than a week. Arghun died on 10 March 1291 in Baghcha, one of his residences in Arran; he was in his early thirties, having been born c. 1258. It is a curious thought that but for the measures he took to ensure longevity he might have lived to match the achievements of his father, Abaqa, and his son, Ghazan. He was the last of the Il-Khans to be accorded the traditional secret burial, being laid to rest on a mountain side near Sujas. The place was concealed and the whole area made a qorugh or sanctuary, to which entry was prohibited, but the ban was lifted in after years when his daughter Oljei founded a khdnqdh or convent for dervishes at the site of his tomb.
G E I K H A T U A N D BAIDU
A week after Arghun's death messengers were sent to summon the three candidates for the throne: his son Ghazan in Khurasan, his brother Geikhatu in Rum and his cousin Baidu at Baghdad. Ghazan, retreating before the rebel Nauruz, received the news, which was at first kept from him, at Simnan; it was followed by reports of the manoeuvres by the partisans of the other candidates and then of Geikhatu's election as Il-Khan; and he halted where he was, in the Simnan-Firuzkuh area, to resume, in due course, the struggle against Nauruz and his Transoxianan allies. Certain of the amirs, and particularly

those involved in the death of Sa'd al-Daula, had favoured Baidu, in whom they saw a more lenient and easy-going ruler; but the supporters of Geikhatu, amongst w h o m we now hear for the first time of the Amir Choban, had won the day, and he was proclaimed khan at a quriltai held near Akhlät on 2$ July 1291, though the actual enthronement cere mony did not take place until a year later. Immediately after the celebrations an inquiry, over which the IIKhän presided in person, was held into the execution of Sacd al-Daula's Mongol colleagues. On this, as on later occasions, Geikhatu showed remarkable clemency. One alone of the conspirators was put to death, the remainder receiving only light punishment when they were not pardoned outright. The new khan's unwillingness to spill blood was apparently due to the advice of the qams, who attributed the shortness of his predecessor's reign to the quantity of blood he had shed. He was soon to demonstrate this same leniency towards offenders against his own interests. After the trial was concluded he returned to Rum to put down a rising and, availing themselves of his absence the Amir Taghachar, the ringleader of the conspirators so recently pardoned, and Sadr al-Din Zanjäni, a former associate of Juvaini's enemy Majd al-Mulk, plotted together to set up one of his uncles in his stead. Their plot uncovered, Taghachar was sent under escort to the quriltai held at AlaTagh in the summer of 1292, at which the ceremony of enthronement was to take place, and Sadr al-Din was cast into prison at Tabriz. Not only was their act of treason forgiven them, but we find Sadr al-Din invested, before the year was out, with the combined office of vizier and sähib-divän, a post for which he had had the effrontery to canvass when just released from prison, while Taghachar was actually chosen as one of the commanders dispatched from Ala-Tagh to the relief of Qa'lat al-Rum.
This fortress, on the right bank of the Euphrates, had been invested by the Mamluk Sultan Ashraf Saläh al-Din Khalil (1290-3), fresh from his victories over the Franks of Acre and Tyre. In June 1292 a force of which Taghachar was apparently second-in-command, was sent to raise the siege, and reinforcements followed a week or so later; but the fortress had fallen to the Egyptians already before the first troops arrived. Ashraf did not follow up this success, contenting himself, in an exchange of letters with Geikhatu, with a threat to invade the latter's territory and re-establish Baghdad as the metropolis of Islam. Mean while there was a detente in relations with the Golden Horde. T o q t a

(i 2 9 1 - 1 3 1 2 ) , who before his accession had led two campaigns across the Caucasus, dispatched, in the spring of 1294, a peace mission which was honourably received by Geikhatu at Dalan Na'ur (in Mongol " Seventy Lakes"), a settlement at the western end of the Great Wall along the Kur. The period of peace thus inaugurated was to last, more or less uninterruptedly, until the reign of Abu Sa'id. On the profligacy of Geikhatu's morals the authorities are with one exception unanimous. He was concerned, says the continuator of Barhebraeus,1
with nothing except riotous living, and amusement and debauchery. He had no thought for anything except the things that were necessary for Kings, and which they were bound to have, and how he could get possession of the sons and daughters of the nobles, and have carnal intercourse with t h e m . . . And very many chaste women among the wives of the nobles fled from him, and others removed their sons and daughters and sent them away to remote districts. But they were unable to save themselves from his hands, or to escape from the shameful acts which he committed with them.
Raşhid al-Din's total silence on this subject is due no doubt to a desire not to embarrass his patrons, the nephews of Geikhatu; but even he is constrained to refer to the ll-Khan's wild extravagance, one of the reasons given for the curious experiment for which his reign is chiefly remembered, the attempt to substitute for metallic currency the paper money of China known as ch'ao. In describing the situation which led up to this experiment Vaşşăf2 alludes not only to the depletion of the treasury by the gross prodig ality of the khan and his vizier Şadr al-Din Zanjăni but also to a disease called by the Turkish name of jut which had caused great havoc in the Mongols' herds in the days following on the death of Arghun. This was not in fact an epidemic but simply the consequences of a cold spell following abruptly upon a period of mild weather.3 It was probably this natural disaster rather than the exhaustion of the exchequer which led to the situation in which, according to the continuator of Barhebraeus,4 not a single sheep could be killed for the Il-Khăn's food. The possibilities of chcao as a means of overcoming their difficulties had

Wheeler, The Modern History of Central Asia, p. 34: "The whole of Kazakh life was regulated by the search for summer grazing grounds with adequate water, and winter pastures sheltered from the wind and cold and particularly from the dreaded d^hut—the freezing over of previously thawed snow which made it impossible for cattle to reach fodder." 4 P. 496.

been discussed by Şadr al-Din and his colleagues on several occasions. At Pil-Suvăr in the spring of 1294, they broached the subject to Geikhatu, who turned to Bolad Ching-Sang, the representative of the Great Khan at his court, for further information on the nature and working of this type of currency. It was decided, despite some opposi tion, to proceed with the experiment, which seems to have been put fully into practice only in Tabriz. Here on 13 August a proclamation was issued imposing the death penalty on all who refused to accept the new currency. Considerable quantities of ch'ao were then prepared and, on 12 September, put into circulation. F o r a week after their first issue these notes were taken from motives of fear, but soon all trade had come to a standstill and the bazaars were completely deserted. In face of public uproar Şadr al-Din was forced first to allow the use of g o l d for the purchase of food and then to suppress the paper currency altogether. The experiment lasted little more than two months and is perhaps most noteworthy as being the first recorded instance of block printing outside of China. It is remarkable that Marco Polo, who with his father and uncle had spent nine months in Tabriz at about this time, should make no mention of this episode, the more so as he describes at length the use of paper currency in China. One can only assume that the Polos left on their homeward journey before the scheme had been set in motion. Unbridled licentiousness and reckless extravagance would no doubt of themselves have brought about the Il-Khan's downfall, which was, however, precipitated by his ill-considered behaviour towards Baidu. Raşhid al-Din1, as one would expect, is extremely reticent about this incident, which took place in Ala-Tagh in the summer of 1294. He says simply that Baidu joined Geikhatu in his summer residence on 12 June, that the latter rebuked him for some unspecified reason and that he was allowed to leave on 11 July having apparently been under some kind of detention. The continuator of Barhebraeus,2 on the other hand, gives a detailed account of the episode, with which Vaşşâf's3 briefer version is in basic agreement. Insulted by Baidu during a drinking bout Geikhatu caused his cousin to be beaten up by his attendants and then, repenting of his action, sought to make amends. Concealing his resentment Baidu returned to his residence at Daquqâ, where, in the winter of 1294-5, he rose in rebellion. From Tabriz Geikhatu dispatched the perfidious Taghachar against his advancing enemy; Taghachar deserted to Baidu, 1 Transl. Arends, p. 136. 2 Pp. 494-5. 8 Bombay ed. p. 275.



HISTORY OF THE ÏL-KHÂNS

and Geikhatu fled, first to Ahar and then to Pil-Suvăr. Here he was overtaken by pursuers whom he thought to be in prison in Tabriz. These were the amirs who, under the leadership of Taghachar, had been responsible for the deaths of Sa'd al-Daula and his Mongol colleagues. Warned of their complicity in Baidu's rebellion Geikhatu had been persuaded by Taghachar to imprison rather than to execute them; and they had then, on Taghachar's orders, been released. They showed no mercy to the man who had twice spared their lives. Geikhatu was strangled with the bowstring on 26 March 1295, apparently on the amirs' own authority without Baidu's sanction or knowledge ; he was 24 years of age. Vaşşăf concludes his account of the catastrophe with a phrase of which d'Ohsson1 renders the sense but not the concision and the elegance : " A la fin l'empire montra à Gaïkhatou ce qu'il aimait, c'est-à-dire, le derrière" The brief reign of Baidu is ignored by Rashid al-Din, who mentions this prince only in connexion with Ghazan's campaign against him. His enthronement took place, according to Vaşşăf,2 in the neighbour hood of Hamadăn in April 1295. On the other hand, the continuator of Barhebraeus3 speaks of a ceremony at ÏJjan, whither he had caused to be transported from Tabriz the "great throne" on which his predecessors, from Abaqa onwards, had been inaugurated. Taghachar now received, as reward for his perfidy, the post of commander-in-chief, Şadr al-Din Zanjăni was replaced as vizier by Jamăl al-Din Dastajirdăni and the executioners of Geikhatu were each appointed to the governorship of a province. Ghazan first heard of Baidu's revolt at Qara-Teppe near Sarakhs when returning from a victory gained over the Transoxianan Mongols. He took no notice and proceeded on his way to Rădkăn, where, according to Rashid al-Din,4 he received a message from Baidu himself formally inviting him to ascend the throne. Having consulted his amirs and sent for Nauruz, with whom he was now reconciled, he returned to his headquarters at Sultan Duvin in the plain between the Atrak and the Gurgăn river, from whence, after a few days, he set out for Azarbâijăn by way of Măzandarăn and cIrăq-i 'Ajam. At Simnăn he was met by emissaries dispatched, before his death, by Geikhatu with a con signment of ch'ao for use in the provinces under Ghazan's jurisdiction.

He caused it all to be burnt, remarking that even iron would not stand up to the damp climate of Mazandaran, to say nothing of paper. At Khail-i Buzurg he learnt, as Rashid al-Din1 puts it, that Baidu had changed his mind and now wanted the Khanate for himself; he prob ably learnt, in actual fact, that Baidu's enthronement was now a fait accompli. H e decided to continue his advance despite the smallness of his forces: his unpreparedness for battle is illustrated by Rashid al-Din2 by the fact that he had left behind his sacred banner (tuq) and royal war drum. He dispatched ambassadors to Baidu to announce his coming and to ask for a safe conduct. Baidu's reply, delivered at Aq-Khwaja, though conciliatory in tone, was to the effect that Ghazan should turn back. Disregarding this warning he still pressed on: at Qongqur-Oleng he gathered, from a close questioning of Baidu's envoys, that his reception might well be hostile, and from thence onward the troops proceeded in battle order. On 16 May they crossed the Safid Rud, and three days later the two armies came face to face at Qurban Shire. After a charge by Ghazan's left wing a truce was called for, apparently on Baidu's initiative, and the two princes, each accompanied by a small group of followers, conferred together on rising ground between the armies. Their negotiations that day did not extend beyond general expressions of good intent, which they affirmed, according to the Mongol custom, with the drinking of wine mixed with gold, a cere mony for which the converts to Islam such as Nauruz substituted an oath and handshake. At nightfall each returned to his own quarters. The next day the two armies proceeded side by side to Qurban Shire, where they encamped so close together as to drink from the same spring; but there was mutual distrust and the troops remained under arms throughout the whole of the night. The following day, 23 May, the representatives of the two princes met to continue their discussions, and it was agreed that the ordus of his father Arghun should go to Ghazan and that he should have control of 'Iraq-i A jam, Khurasan, Qumis, Mazandaran and one half of Fars. As the negotiations proceeded Baidu's troops had been strongly reinforced, and Ghazan, fearing treachery, decided to withdraw, leaving Nauruz behind to complete the negotiations. He decamped in the night of 24-5 May, crossed the Safid Rud at dawn and by nightfall had reached Zanjan; the next day he continued on his journey to Damavand, where he was to spend the summer. Baidu's troops set out at once in his pursuit and advanced as 1 Op. cit. p. 287. 2 Loc. tit.



HISTORY OF THE IL-KHANS
far as Qongqur-Oleng before giving up the chase. As for Nauruz, he and his colleagues were arrested and detained, and one at least of Baidu's amirs demanded his execution. He was, however, not without friends in the ll-Khan's entourage, and prompted, it is said, by Sadr al-Din Zanjani, he undertook upon oath to deliver either Ghazan's head or his person bound hand and foot. Released on the strength of this undertaking he fulfilled the letter of his oath, upon reaching Ghazan at Firuzkuh, by sending Baidu a cauldron (in Turkish qa^an or ghazan) tied up in a sack. In Ghazan's councils Nauruz, himself a Muslim of long standing, now impressed upon his master (as he had done during the parleys at Qurban Shire) the desirability of following his example and adopting Islam. Ghazan, who had been brought up as a Buddhist and had himself erected Buddhist temples in Khurasan, responded to the suggestion with alacrity, partly no doubt out of genuine conviction, as Rashid al-Din,1 himself a convert from Judaism, is careful to insist, but partly also for reasons similar to those that weighed with Henry of Navarre. His declaration of faith, an important moment in the history of Persia and of Islam, took place on 19 June 1295 in the mountain pastures of the Lar valley, high up in the Alburz.2 After performing the ritual ablution he entered a pavilion frequented in former times by his father Arghun and, instructed by Shaikh Sadr al-Din Ibrahim Hamawi, repeated several times the Kalima or Muslim Creed. His amirs followed his example in a body, and the month of Ramadan coming round shortly afterwards (15 July to 13 August in that year) they observed for the first time the precepts of their new religion in the company of shaikhs and imams. T h e fasting over Ghazan set out, as the Muslim commander of a Muslim army, to overthrow the last non-Muslim ruler of Persia. His advance westwards was in the nature more of a triumphal procession than of a military campaign. Already before his departure he had learnt from Baidu's own envoy of the support he enjoyed in the latter's camp; and at every stage of the journey he met with fresh evidence of that support. At Firuzkuh he received Sadr al-Din Zanjani, the promoter of the ch'ao experiment, now the first of Baidu's officials to defect to his rival. Near Ustunavand, a castle in that same area, he welcomed the Amir Choban and Qurumshi, the son of Alinaq, whom, at their own request, he sent on ahead to join Nauruz in the advanced

party. At Aq-Khwâja he learnt that Taghachar had abandoned Baidu, as he had abandoned Geikhatu before him and was now allied with Nauruz in pursuit of his master. T o the west of Sujâs Ghazan was met by his brother Khar-Banda, the future Il-Khàn Oljeitii; and on the banks of the Safïd Rùd, a group of powerful amirs came to place their services at his disposal. He halted at Yuz Aghach to await the latest news of Baidu, who had fled before Nauruz's troops towards the Araxes and Nakhchivan, Hearing nothing he went on to Ujan, where he learnt that the Il-Khan had been captured and brought back to Tabriz and that he had requested an interview with Ghazan. Suspecting the motives of this request Ghazan gave orders not to bring the prisoner to his presence but to execute him on the spot. He was put to death in a garden outside Tabriz on 4 October 1295. Haithon1 speaks of Baidu as a " good Christian " and indeed ascribes his downfall to his patronage of the Christians. His pro-Christian attitude was due, according to the continuator of Barhebraeus, to the influence of Abaqa's wife Despoina, the natural daughter of Michael Palaeologus.2 The same authority goes on to say that he became a Muslim but "was never able to learn the ablutions and the fasts". The probability is that he was one of the minority that still clung to the old shamanistic deism which showed equal respect to all faiths and religions.
GHAZAN
Ghazan arrived at the gates of Tabriz on 4 October, the very day of his predecessor's execution. Already the first decree of the new Islamic régime was being enforced within the town, viz. that all churches, synagogues and Buddhist temples were to be destroyed here, at Baghdad and throughout the Il-Khân's domains.

But it was on the Buddhists that the decree and its consequences weighed heaviest. " And this after the honour to which they had been promoted by the Mongol kings, and which was so great that one half of the money which was gathered together in the treasury of the kingdom had been given to them, and it had been expended ( ?) on the work of images of gold and silver. And a very large number of the pagan priests, because of the way in which they were persecuted became Muslims."1 Measures such as these were, it seems, due to the fanaticism of men like Nauruz who had brought Ghazan to power and whose policies, for a time at least, he was obliged to follow. Once established on the throne he reverted, as far as was consistent with his Muhammadanism, to the religious tolerance of his predecessors, and we are told by Rashid al-Din2 that when two years later, on 21 July 1298 (significantly a Sunday), the Tabriz mob proceeded to wreck such churches as were still left standing the Il-Khan was angry and saw to it that the ring leaders were punished. On 1 7 October Ghazan left Tabriz to spend the winter in Arran. He halted in the early stages of the journey to go through the Muslim marriage ceremony with a lady who had been the wife of his father Arghun and then (apparently against her will) of his uncle Geikhatu. The custom of a son's marrying his father's widows other than his own mother can be traced back, as Togan3 has shown, through the whole history of the Altaic peoples: it had been observed by Ghazan's father, grandfather and great grandfather, the Christian wife of Hiilegu, the celebrated Doquz Khatun, having been previously married to Tolui. That a Muslim divine should have been willing to solemnize such a marriage seems almost incredible; that an apparently sincere convert to Islam should have formed a union expressly condemned in the Qur'an4 shows how strong the old traditions still remained. After the wedding celebrations Ghazan proceeded by way of Ahar into Mughan, where he halted for a while near Bakrabad and where he was joined by Nauruz. The latter, now appointed the Il-Khan's lieutenant-general and commander-in-chief, had been left behind in Tabriz to deal with various administrative matters including the raising of a loan from wealthy Tabrizis, the treasury being, as was to be expected, completely exhausted. From Bakrabad they crossed the Araxes into the Qarabagh Steppe,

GHAZAN
where, at a ceremony held on 3 November 1295, Ghazan was enthroned as khan, assuming as a Muslim ruler the name of Mahmud and the title of sultan. Ghazan had many problems to cope with in the first winter of his reign. Prince Siige, an uncle of the Il-Khan, sent eastwards to repel a Chaghatai invasion, halted on the Karaj to plot rebellion; Nauruz, in command of the advance forces, turned back to engage him in battle; he was defeated, captured and executed. A fellow conspirator, Prince Arslan, a descendant of Chingiz-Khan's brother Jochi-Qasar, continued the rebellion in the Pil-Suvar area. Engaged by Qutlugh-Shah, one of the most capable of Ghazan's generals, at Bailaqan he was finally put to flight after a hotly contested battle. With his execution on 29 March 1296 the rebellion came to an end: it had cost the lives of three princes of the blood. Whilst this civil war was still in progress, a horde of Oirat, who had their grazing lands in the Diyarbakr area, migrated en masse into Syria and placed themselves under the protection of the Mamluk sultan, then Ket-Bugha (1294-6). At about the same time Prince Ilder, a grandson of Hiilegii, fled for some unspecified reason into Asia Minor, was defeated in battle, hid for a while in the neighbourhood of Erzerum and was finally captured and killed. Taghachar too now met his end. In November 1295 Ghazan had sent him to Rum on the grounds that he was a man of fickle character {sari6 al-inqildb)1 and that it was safer to keep him at a distance. Shortly afterwards he caused him to be discreetly put to death. The Il-Khan had some compunction about this treatment of a man to whom he owed a debt of gratitude and who was only of potential danger; and in justification of his action he recounted to his intimates an analogous episode in the history of China. The removal of Taghachar was not without its consequences. Baltu, the military commander in Asia Minor, who had been involved in his death, now rose in revolt, egged on by Prince Ildei, another of Ghazan's great uncles. The revolt was suppressed by an expedition led by Qutlugh-Shah in the winter of 1296-7. Ildei, who was tried and executed in the previous autumn, was no less than the fifth prince of the blood to come to a violent end within the first twelve months of Ghazan's reign.
In June 1296 Ghazan held a quriltai in pasture lands with the Mongol name of Sayin ( " G o o d " ) between Ardabil and Sarab. It was here that he received Nauruz, towards whom, for reasons that shall appear, his

feelings had begun to cool. Upon Nauruz's approach the Chaghatai army had quickly withdrawn. A brief reconnaissance raid satisfied him as to the fact of their withdrawal and he at once returned to Azarbaijan to visit his sick wife. His departure and the rumours to which it gave rise led to large-scale desertions so that the defences of Khurasan were greatly depleted. Hearing of his return Ghazan was angry and ordered him back to his p o s t ; and his reply, to the effect that he must first see his wife (a daughter of Abaqa), only increased the Il-Khan's anger. At Sayin he was accorded every honour, but the amirs perceived the change in the Il-Khan's attitude and impressed upon him the inadvisability of sending this arrogant and unscrupulous man back to Khurasan. Ghazan was inclined to agree with them but his sense of gratitude prevailed over his judgment, and on 3 July Nauruz took his leave for the last time. His downfall and death little more than a year later were due, in the event, not to disloyal ambition but to the machinations of his enemies. On his journey to Baghdad in the following autumn Ghazan halted for a while in the Hamadan region, where he received the maliks of 'Iraq-i 'Ajam, as also Afrasiyab I, the atabeg of Greater Luristan (1288-96), who had risen in rebellion at the time of Arghun's death. Afrasiyab, despite his record, was treated with favour and had started on the homeward journey, when he was arrested by the general Horqudaq just returning from Fars and, on the strength of the latter's accusations, put to death. It was at Hamadan, too, that Jamal al-Din Dastajirdani was appointed sahib-divan inplace of Sharaf al-Din Simnani, who in turn had displaced Sadr al-Din Zanjani, disgraced after only a brief tenure of office. Jamal al-Din's appointment lasted little more than a month. Brought to trial on charges instigated by Sadr al-Din he was executed on 27 October 1296 and was succeeded in the office of vizier or sahib-divan (the two posts seem at times to merge into one) by his antagonist. It was during the trial of Jamal al-Din Dastajirdani that the full facts of Nauruz's correspondence with the Mamluk sultan were first brought to light. He had, in the last months of Baidu's reign, appealed to the ruler of Egypt for help in the overthrow of the infidel Il-Khan. The sultan's reply arrived after Ghazan's triumph, when the situation was altogether changed; and Nauruz judged it prudent to show his master, not the real text, but a substitute version prepared, at his orders, by Jamal al-Din Dastajirdani. Nauruz's emissary had been a certain \Alam



QHAZAN
583
al-Din Qaisar, the clerk of a Baghdadi merchant, who in the course of his duties made frequent visits to Egypt. He was arrested at Baghdad on 13 March 1 2 9 7 and Sadr al-Din Z anjam, seizing this opportunity of avenging himself on Nauruz, caused a number of forged letters to be secreted in the prisoner's effects. Qaisar was taken before Ghazan at Shahr-Aban to the north-east of Baghdad on the Khurasan road. Questioned by the Il-Khan in person he recounted the true facts of the correspondence. His belongings were then searched and the letters, apparently addressed by Nauruz to Egyptian amirs, discovered. Sadr al-Din and his associates attested that the writing was that of Nauruz's secretary, and Ghazan, enraged by this seemingly damning evidence, had Qaisar executed on the spot and gave orders for the extirpation of the whole of Nauruz's family, three of his brothers (two of them implicated in the spurious correspondence) and a son being seized and put to death within the space of little more than a month. At Asadabad, as he returned northwards, the Il-Khan was joined by Qutlugh-Shah from Mughan and by the amirs Choban and Bolad-Qaya from Ray. Bolad-Qaya was at once dispatched to join advance parties under the amirs Horqudaq and Sonitei in pursuit of Nauruz; and was followed shortly afterwards by Qutlugh-Shah at the head of the main army. At Damghan Qutlugh-Shah learnt that Nauruz's shahnas here and in all towns from Ray eastwards had been put to death by Horqudaq's forces. East of Isfara'in he was joined by a deserter from Nauruz's army, an officer called Danishmand Bahadur, whom he sent on ahead with the vanguard. Danishmand overtook Nauruz somewhere to the east of Nishapur and, despite the smallness of his own force, inflicted a heavy defeat upon him. Nauruz abandoned his b a g g a g e and fled in the direction of Herat, pursued now by Horqudaq and the whole of the advance forces. At Jam, under cover of darkness, he sprang an ambuscade on his pursuers and then continued his flight. Arrived before Herat he was offered asylum by the Malik Fakhr al-Din Kart. His amirs urged him not to trust himself to the malik; he replied that for three days past he had been unable to perform the namdt^ and that he could neglect his religious duties no longer. He entered the town accom panied only by 400 horse, and was accommodated by Fakhr al-Din in the citadel. Meanwhile Qutlugh-Shah, also a good Muslim, arriving at Mashhad, had visited the shrine of the Imam Rida and prayed that his enemy might be delivered into his hands. His prayer was to be granted. Summer was at its height when Qutlugh-Shah invested Herat, and

because of the great heat and the strength of the fortifications he was advised to abandon the siege and withdraw. He indignantly rejected this advice and soon found means of achieving his purpose. T h e shaikh al-Islam of J a m was made to write a letter to Fakhr al-Din urging him to surrender Nauruz if he wished to save the town from destruction. The letter was smuggled into the town and produced its effect. Despite the great debt of gratitude which Fakhr al-Din owed to Nauruz (who during his father's lifetime had secured his release from imprisonment by a personal guarantee of his good behaviour) he decided in the end to betray his guest rather than risk Ghazan's wrath. A device was found to separate Nauruz from his followers and he was overpowered and bound. The severed head of his secretary, the same man whose hand writing Sadr al-Din had affected to recognize in the forged letters, was sent to Qutlugh-Shah as proof of his master's detention, and in return for a written assurance confirmed by oath, that no harm should come to the town, Nauruz himself was handed over to his pursuers. The jubilant Qutlugh-Shah attempted to interrogate him. It was for Ghazan, Nauruz said, and not for the likes of him, to question him, and he refused to answer, " knowing that he had committed no crime".1 Qutlugh-Shah ordered him to be cut in two, and his head was sent to Baghdad, where for some years it was exposed on one of the city gates. So ended the career of this powerful and turbulent man, probably destined, had his life been spared, to have played the same role of king-maker and mayor of the palace in Persia as had his elder con temporary Prince Noqai in the Golden Horde. The death of the " second Abu. Muslim", as Vassaf2 aptly calls him, occurred on 13 August 1297.
In Tabriz, on 2 November, there took place a ceremony that would have gladdened Nauruz's heart. The Il-Khan and his amirs in a body formally exchanged their broad-brimmed Mongol hats for the Muslim turban. In our own days we have witnessed, in the very regions over which Ghazan ruled, the reversal of this process by laws which substi tuted for the fez and the kulah a form of headgear as ill-suited as the M o n g o l for the performance of the namdv>? Soon after the ceremony Ghazan left for Arran, where he spent the winter of 1 2 9 7 - 8 and where, in the following spring, the execution of a prince of the blood was

In Iran the change was made in two stages. In 1928 a peaked cap replaced the kulah, for which in 1935 the normal European headgear was substituted.

shortly followed by that of his vizier, the infamous Sadr al-Din Zanjani. The prince of the blood was Taichu, a son of Mengu-Temur and therefore Ghazan's great uncle. His crime seems to have been little more than lending a credulous ear to a prophecy made by a Muslim divine that within forty days he would succeed to the throne. He was arrested on 13 April 1298 on the banks of the Qara-Kuderi (in Mongol "Black Musk Deer"), apparently a canal cut from the Kur, and was put to death on the 15 th near Dalan Na'ur. His fate was shared by the prophet and by all who had been present when he made his prophecy. Whether or not Taichu's guilt was such as to justify the death penalty, it is impossible, on the evidence available, to reach an opinion; the punishment of Sadr al-Din, the Sadr-i Jahdn as his title went, was certainly richly deserved. On 28 March 1298 he was accused before Ghazan of having embezzled state funds. A couple of days later, no doubt with these accusations in mind, Sadr al-Din taxed Rashid al-Din (who now appears on the scene for the first time, apparently as a subordinate to Sadr al-Din) with having traduced him behind his back. He was silenced by Ghazan, who took Rashid al-Din's part but seemed otherwise disposed to let matters rest. At this juncture Qutlugh-Shah, returning from a campaign in Georgia, upbraided Sadr al-Din for the economic conditions in that country. T o avert the blame from himself the vizier told Ghazan that it was in fact Qutlugh-Shah's officers who had ruined Georgia. Puzzled at the khan's attitude of disapproval Qutlugh-Shah asked Sadr al-Din who it was that had spoken ill of him. He said that it was Rashid al-Din. It so happened that Qutlugh-Shah was on familiar terms with Rashid al-Din and he took the first occasion to reproach him for this unfriendly act; he refused, however, to disclose the name of his informant. Rashid al-Din then approached the Il-Khan in person, and when Ghazan sent for Qutlugh-Shah he had no option but to name the vizier. Ghazan's patience was now at an end. Sadr al-Din was arrested and put on trial; he answered his interrogators with the utmost aplomb and might, given time, have extricated himself even from this situation. However, he was handed over to QutlughShah and, on 4 May, met the same end at the hands of the same executioner as his great antagonist the Amir Nauruz. Soon after these executions Ghazan left Dalan Na'ur for Tabriz, where on 3 June, the brother and nephew of Sadr al-Din were likewise put to death.
From Tabriz, on 1 1 September, the Il-Khan set out for his winter

quarters in the Baghdad area, at about the same time appointing Sa'd al-Din Savaji as Sadr al-Din's successor with, apparently, Rashid al-Din as his associate or deputy. Travelling by way of Hamadan and Burujird he arrived on 29 November in the region of Wasit, where he remained until February 1299 and where he received the news of Sulemish's revolt in Asia Minor. Sulemish had been sent by Qutlugh-Shah in pursuit of Baku after the latter's defeat in the winter of 1296-7, and it was presumably he who had brought Baku to Tabriz, where he had been executed on 14 September 1297. It was then that Ghazan had appointed Sulemish commander-in-chief in Rum. He had at the same time deposed the Saljuq ruler Mas'ud II, the son of Kai-Khusrau II, suspected of complicity in Baku's rising, and had replaced him by his nephew 'Ala' al-Din Kai Qubad II (1297-1300). Mas'ud, it may be anticipated here, was restored to the throne in 1300 and reigned for four years: he was the last of the Saljuqs of Rum. In the winter of 1298-9 there were heavy snowfalls in Asia Minor cutting off all communications with the East, and Sulemish took advantage of this situation to spread the rumour that Ghazan had been dethroned. He then rose in revolt, killing the generals whom Ghazan had associated with him in the command, gathering together a force of some 50,000 men and obtaining the promise of support from Syria. T o suppress the rebellion an army under the command of Qutlugh-Shah set out from Wasit on 15 February 1299. On 27 April a battle was fought near Aq-Shahr between Sivas and Arzinjan on the high road to Persia. Sulemish was defeated and put to flight; he escaped into Syria and proceeded to Cairo, where he was favourably received by the sultan; but deciding to return to Rum in search of his family, he was captured by the Armenians upon entering Cilicia and handed over to Ghazan. Ghazan, meanwhile, whilst journeying from Najaf to Baghdad, had received in audience a group of dissident Mamluk amirs led by Saif al-Din Qipchaq, the governor of Damascus. Their quarrel had been with Sultan Lachin (1296-8) and learning at Ra's al-'Ain of his death, they had regretted their decision to defect to the Il-Khan. It was, however, too late to turn back and, admitted to Ghazan's presence, they assured him, with such conviction as they could muster, of their support in the invasion of Syria and Egypt. Ghazan remained in Baghdad for less than a fortnight (8-20 March 1299) before setting out on the journey back to Azarbaijan. In Ujan, where he arrived on 28 May, he held a quriltai shortly followed by the execution of several

of Sülemişh's officers. Sülemişh himself was put to death in Tabriz otl 27 September. Of the form of execution Raşhîd al-Din says1 only that it was " h o r r i b l e " (sham*): his body was burnt and the ashes flung to the wind. Ghazan, at about this time, was affected with ophthalmia; and wild rue was burnt and prayers offered up in order to avert the evil eye. At Tabriz Ghazan learnt of a Syrian incursion into Upper Meso potamia. The invaders had captured Mardin and attacked Ra's al-'Ain; they had desecrated the mosques by their scandalous behaviour in them, and this during Ramadan (falling that year in June); and they had carried off great numbers of prisoners when they withdrew. Ghazan had no difficulty in obtaining a fatwa for a war of retaliation, and on 16 October he set out for Syria. Proceeding by way of Mosul and Nasibin he crossed the Euphrates on 7 December at Qal'at Ja'bar. On the western bank of the river in the Plain of Şiffin, the scene of the famous battle between cAli and Mu'awiya, he was heartened with news of dissension amongst the enemy, presumably reports of the attempt by the Oirat refugees to overthrow Sultân Naşir. The Mongol forces arrived before Aleppo on 12 December but did not attempt to invest the town; instead they turned southwards, passing to the east of Hama on the 20th and encamping near Salamiyya on the edge of the Syrian Desert. The enemy, as Ghazan now learnt, had concentrated their forces near Himş in the same strategically favourable position from which, eighteen years before, they had inflicted a crushing defeat on Mengü-Temür. He decided not to make a frontal attack but, by turning eastwards into the desert, to outflank the Mamlüks and take them from the rear. On the banks of a stream some ten miles north of Himş the troops, in accordance with this change of plan, were ordered to draw three days' supply of water. This was on 22 December. The enemy had intended to attack the next day, but mistaking the purpose of the Mongols' movements and thinking they were about to retreat they decided to give battle at once. As the enemy approached Ghazan drew up such of his forces as were at hand, Qutlugh-Shah commanding on the right and he himself in the centre. Qutlugh-Shah caused the great war-drums to be beaten and the Egyptians, imagining this to indicate the presence of the khan, charged in great strength upon the right wing, which broke before them; but the centre, where Ghazan himself, contrary to M o n g o l usage, took part in the fighting and where he was

joined by Qutlugh-Shah from the routed right, stood firm until the left wing was able to take up its position. The battle, which lasted from eleven o'clock until nightfall, ended in the total defeat of the Mamluks. Advancing slowly in the tracks of the retreating enemy Ghazan en camped some three miles from Hims. Town and citadel surrendered without a blow, and Ghazan found himself in possession of the Sultan's treasure abandoned by the Mamluks in their precipitate flight. H e distributed the contents amongst his amirs, keeping for himself, according to Haithon, only a sword and a leather bag containing the title deeds of the kingdom of Egypt and the muster roll of its army. As for his prowess in the battle, says Haithon, himself present in the suite of Hetcum II, " i t will be talked of amongst the Tartars for all t i m e " . 1 A fath-ndma or bulletin proclaiming the victory, penned by none other than Vassaf, was dispatched to Tabriz and all the chief cities of Ghazan's empire; and the next day, 28 December, the Mongols advanced on Damascus deserted, like Hims, by its defenders. On 31 December a deputation of Damascene notables came to sue for quarter, and three days later Ghazan was encamped in the famous meadows of Marj Rahit to the east of the town, where he received the homage of the populace. On the following Friday, 8 January 1300, the khutba was read in Damascus in Ghazan's n a m e ; on the 2 3 r d he learnt from the officer sent in their pursuit that the Egyptians had been driven out of Syria. The Mongols evacuated the country as quickly as they had occupied it. Ghazan left Damascus as early as 5 February, possibly because of reports of the Qarauna inroads in Southern Persia; whatever the reason for his departure, it cannot have been, as Rashid al-Din2 appears to suggest, the approach of the hot season. He crossed the Euphrates, again as before at Qal'at Ja'bar, on a bridge of his own invention consisting of inflated skins lashed together with bark rope. In the Mosul area, which he reached on 8 March, he was joined in early April by Qutlugh-Shah, whom he had left in command at Damascus. After Ghazan's departure Qutlugh-Shah had laid siege to the citadel, which had continued to offer resistance after the capitulation of the town, but discouraged by his lack of success had abandoned these operations after a matter of days and followed in his master's wake. According to Rashid al-Din,3 he brought news of rebellious activities on the part of Qipchaq, whom the Il-Khan had reinstated as military governor of 1 P. 318. 2 Transl. Arends, p. 188. 3 Op. cit. p. 190.



Damascus; but this is probably only an anticipation of subsequent events. On leaving Damascus Qutlugh-Shah had handed over the command to Mulai, the same officer who had pursued the Egyptians to the frontier. Alarmed by rumours put about by Qipchaq, now in correspondence with Sultân Naşir, he too withdrew from Syria, catching up with Ghazan on 8 May at or near Darband-i Zangi between Hulwan and Shahrazûr. By this time the Egyptians had already reoccupied Damascus; by the end of May they had restored Mamlük rule throughout the whole of Syria. Ghazan, however, had no intention of renouncing his conquests; and in the autumn he returned to the attack. The summer he had spent in Âzarbâijân: first in Marâgheh, where he had inspected the observatory and explained to the scientists his plans for another and more elaborate one in Tabriz; then in Ojân, where, on 13 July, he had summoned a quriltai; and finally in Tabriz, where he had remained till the end of September, watching the progress in the building of the Gunbad-i 'Âli, his future mausoleum. On 30 September he left for Syria; Qutlugh-Shah at the head of large forces, had been sent on in advance on the 16th. Ghazan followed the same route as on the previous expedition, crossing the Euphrates on 30 December, again at Qal'at Ja'bar. From Jabbûl, which they reached on 3 January 1301, the Mongols approached the outskirts of Aleppo (which, as in the previous campaign, they made no attempt to invest) and then turned southwards, encamping on the 18th in the vicinity of Qinnisrin. They advanced no further and the forces under Qutlugh-Shah were ordered to halt at Sarmin. Ghazan, according to Raşhid al-Din,1 had received no reports of enemy movements and wished to spare a Muslim country from devastation. In point of fact military operations by either side had been rendered impossible by torrential and continuous rains, and the consequent floods and the cold had caused havoc amongst the horses and camels: Raşhid al-Din2 himself speaks of the plight of two Mongol amirs entrapped with their men and beasts in a sea of mud. Ghazan turned back on 2 February, crossing the Euphrates at Raqqa, where he visited the tombs of the martyrs of Şiffin, and reaching the ordus of his ladies at Chahâr Tâq near Sinjâr on the 25 th. On 1 9 May he crossed the Tigris into the Kurdish country and directed a punitive expedition against the inhabitants. It was from here that he sent an embassy to the Mamlük sultan. On 2 June he was back in Ojân.

Ghazan passed the whole of the summer in tJjan, during which time a conspiracy against his minister Sacd al-Din was uncovered and suppressed, three officials of the Divan being put to death. The ll-Khan, remarks Rashid al-Din,1 a propos of these executions, was so tender hearted that if a fly fell in his food he would lift it out and set it gently down so that its wings might not be broken. " I t is more difficult for m e , " he would say, " to kill an innocent gnat than a guilty human being; for to allow a mischievous man to live only leads to disorders, especially in affairs of state." After a brief stay in Ala-Tagh Ghazan left, on 23 November, for his winter-quarters in Arran. It was here, in the Qarabagh country on 19 December, that he received his ambassadors on their return from Egypt with the Sultan's reply to his message. Versions of both documents have been preserved by the Egyptian historians.2 Nasir's letter, though mainly concerned with a rebuttal of Ghazan's charges, ended on a conciliatory note with an offer of peace and an alliance. From Qarabagh Ghazan now went on a hunting expedition into the mountains of Shirvan and Lakzistan, i.e. the south-eastern spur of the Caucasian range; from thence he proceeded to the plain called Gavbari in the Mughan Steppe, where he passed some time hunting and fishing before m o v i n g into the area to which he had given the Turkish name of Qush-Qapugh ("Bird Gate"). This was the narrow coastal strip stretching northwards from the Gulf of Kirov (as it is now known) to the present-day Divichi (formerly Barmaki). Rashid al-Din speaks of cranes and waterfowl flying overhead on their way back from their winter to their summer range; and in fact the shores of the gulf are to this day a resting place for migrating birds, which in 1929 was estab lished as a nature reserve. It was from Qush-Qapugh, on 12 April 1302, that Ghazan wrote a letter to the pope (then Boniface VIII), of which the Mongol original was discovered in the Vatican archives in 1921. After referring to a message from the pope delivered by the Genoese Buscarel the Il-Khan speaks of a yarligh transmitted in reply by a mission composed of the same Buscarel and two Mongols. This yarligh was apparently, as suggested by Mostaert and Cleaves,3 a detailed plan of campaign for the invasion of Syria proposed by Ghazan to Boniface and the Christian princes. " A s for now," he goes on, " we are making our preparations exactly in the manner [laid down in our yarligh]. You too should prepare your troops, send word to the

rulers of the various nations and not fail to keep the rendezvous. Heaven willing we [i.e. Ghazan] shall make the great work [i.e. the war against the Mamluks] our sole aim."1 On the preparations to which Ghazan referred in this letter there is no precise information in the Muslim sources; but the dispatch of Qutlugh-Shah to Diyarbakr at the end of September 1301, and his recall a month later had presumably some connexion with the proposed campaign. Ghazan himself seems not to have returned to Tabriz until the early summer of 1302. From the coastal strip he had gone back into the mountains to receive the submission of the Lakz, the modern Lezghians, the same tribesmen subdued twenty-five years earlier by Shams al-Din Juvaini. Then, returning southwards, he had entered the jungles of Talish, where he had held a great battue, constructing for this purpose a kind of vast stockade, consisting of two wooden fences a day's journey apart at the one end and converging to a width of less than fifty yards. Rashid al-Din enumerates the various species of animals entrapped in this enclosure but, curiously enough, does not mention the tiger, still in modern times a native of that region. From Talish Ghazan made his way, by easy stages, to Tabriz and from thence, at the end of July, to Ujan, where he was lodged in a huge tent of gold cloth, which it had taken three years to construct and a whole month to erect. Three days of religious devotion and reading from the Qur'an were followed by feasting and revelry, and the festivities concluded with a quriltai at which dispositions were made for the contemplated campaign in Syria. Ghazan's brother Khar-Banda, the future Oljeitu, was placed, as heretofore, in command of the eastern frontiers; Qutlugh-Shah was sent into Georgia to recruit a Georgian contingent to join the Mongol forces in Diyarbakr; and Ghazan himself set out on 26 August 1302, by a circuitous route which took him southwards to Hilla by way of Kirmanshah and then north-westwards along the right bank of the Euphrates to Rahbat al-Sham, From Hamadan he even made an easterly detour to the pasture lands on the Chaghan-Na'ur in Farahan before turning back and striking the Khurasan trunk road near Bisitun. As he passed by Kirmanshah he recalled how in that region, five years previously, he had slept with his followers under a great rock with a solitary tree casting its shade over them. It was during the supposed revolt of Nauruz and his party; Nauruz's brother Lakzi had not yet been captured; Nauruz himself was

still all-powerful in distant Khurasan; and Ghazan had passed an un easy night, filled with anxiety for the future. H e revisited the spot with all his amirs and ladies and was moved to tears at the contrast between his circumstances then and now. After he had offered up prayers of thanksgiving his amirs, reverting to a custom of their pagan fore fathers, attached streamers to the branches of the tree and danced around it to the strains of music. Bolad Ching-Sang, the representative of the Great Khan, who was present in Ghazan's suite, related how Qutula, a great uncle of Chingiz-Khan, had performed a similar cere mony to celebrate a victory over the Merkit; and how he and his warriors continued to dance until the pressure of their feet had formed a circular trench around the tree. Ghazan was pleased with the tale and, good Muslim though he was, himself for a while joined in the dancing. He was apparently still in the mountains of Kurdistan when mes sengers arrived from Qutlugh-Shah escorting a party of Syrian amirs who had come to offer their allegiance: these were apparently distinct from a deputation of three who had joined him at Bisitun. At about the same time he received an embassy from the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II ( 1 2 8 2 - 1 3 2 8 ) , who offered the hand of a daughter in marriage and sought the Il-Khan's protection against his Turkish neighbours. Ghazan now descended into the plains of Iraq somewhere to the north of Bandinjan1 on the Kbuzistan border, where he stayed for three days at the beginning of December before embarking upon a hunting expedition in the Wasit region. By the end of the month he was in Hilla, where he received two embassies: from the Mamluk sultan and from Toqta, the ruler of the Golden Horde. Of the sultan's message Rashid al-Din2 says only that it was not to Ghazan's liking: it was, according to Mirkhwand,3 a rejection of a demand by the Il-Khan for annual tribute and the insertion of his name in the khutba and on the sultan's coinage. As for Toqta's embassy Rashid al-Din gives no indication whatsoever of its purpose, which was, again according to Mirkhwand,4 to revive the old claim of the House of Jochi upon Arran and Azarbaijan. The ambassadors had an escort of 300 horse—too few, as Ghazan sarcastically remarked, to conquer the country and too many for the delivery of a message. The Mongol New Year occurring at this time the members of both embassies were included in the celebrations,

the sultan's envoys being afterwards sent to Tabriz as prisoners on parole. On 29 January, Ghazan crossed the Euphrates at Hilla on the famous bridge of boats and on 5 February visited the shrine of Husain at Karbalâ. He then turned northwards along the western bank of the river. At Hadiţha the greater part of the womenfolk were sent across to the eastern bank to await the ll-Khăn's return at Sinjăr; his favourite wife accompanied him as far as 'Ana (" there is " , says Raşhid al-Din,1 " n o more delightful place in the whole world"), which he reached on 2 March. His pace along this stretch of the route had been leisurely in the extreme, averaging less than ten miles a day; and the whole of one week had been spent in pursuit of game still apparently as plentiful as in the days of Xenophon,2 the Arabian ostrich. It was at 'Ana that Vaşşâf presented the Il-Khan with the first three books of his history and was encouraged to continue with his work. The Mongols remained here for a week before advancing on Rahbat al-Shăm, which they reached on 1 8 March. T h e inhabitants at first made some show of resistance but after some days of negotiations, in which Raşhid al-Din played a leading part, were induced to surrender. On the 26th, as Ghazan continued northwards, he was heartened with news of the defeat and death of Qaidu in a battle with the Great Khan's forces; he learnt at the same time that Qutlugh-Shâh and the Amir Choban had crossed the Euphrates at Raqqa and approached Aleppo. He halted for three days on the river bank, dispatched his amirs and troops to join Qutlugh-Şhăh, and then recrossed the Euphrates en route for Sinjăr and Mosul. Why he chose to withdraw from personal participation in the campaign is by no means clear. Raşhid al-Din3 ascribes his retirement, unconvincingly, to the approach of the hot weather and the seasonal floods, while Haithon4 speaks of an invasion of his eastern frontiers by Qaidu, who in point of fact had been dead for more than a year and a half. Of his itinerary Raşhid al-Din,5 who evidently accompanied him, gives a detailed account. The passage of the Euphrates took place on 2 April; he crossed the Khăbur at Mâkisin and advanced at a very leisurely pace across the desert, then covered with spring flowers, hunting the game animals as he went; on the 14th he joined his women folk at Chahăr Ţâq near Sinjăr, on the 19th he was at Tall A'far, where he conferred the Sultanate of Northern Mesopotamia upon Najm al

Din II (i 294-1312), the Artuqid ruler of Mardin; crossing the Tigris at Mosul he encamped on the plain of Kushaf, apparently to be identified with the town of Haditha above the confluence of the Great Zab: here he awaited the outcome of the campaign. Qutlugh-Shah's army advanced through Syria without meeting serious resistance; they reached the Damascus area on 19 April and on the following day passed on through Kiswa to encounter the sultan's army drawn up on a famous battle-field of early Islam, the meadows of Marj al-Suffar. A charge by the Mongol left wing on the Mamluk right inflicted heavy casualties on the Egyptians and drove them back in headlong rout. Meanwhile Qutlugh-Shah, who had gone to their assistance from the centre, was attacked by the Mamluk centre and left and forced back on to a neighbouring hill, where he was joined by the troops returning from their pursuit of the enemy's right wing. Here the Mongols were compelled to pass the night, the hill completely encircled by Mamluk troops. In the morning, suffering by now from thirst, they were unable to break through the cordon until the Egyptians deliberately opened their ranks to let them through, the more easily to destroy them in their flight. The Mongols made their way down to the river, apparently the modern Wadi 'Arram, losing a great number of their horses in the muddy terrain, and the Egyptians then launched their attack, pursuing the fleeing enemy until nightfall: the pursuit was taken up in the morning by a Mamluk amir who continued to follow them as far as Qariyatain. Travelling with what appears to have been indecent haste QutlughShah reached Ghazan at K u s h a f on 7 May, and was presumably the first to inform him of the Mongols' disastrous defeat. Of the Il-Khan's reaction to the news and his reception of the messenger Rashid al-Din says not a word. According to Maqrizi1 the effect of the report was so violent as to bring on a nasal haemorrhage: his attitude towards Qutlugh-Shah may be deduced from the Egyptian's account of his subsequent behaviour at the court of inquiry held in June-July at Ujan. Ghazan left the next day for Irbil, celebrating the 'id al-fitr (falling that year on 18 May) at Darband-i Zangi in the foothills of Kurdistan and proceeding from thence to Maragheh. On 4 June, at some point along this route, he was joined by Choban, who, in contrast to his colleague, had remained with the defeated army, attending to the wants of the horseless and the wounded, and leading them slowly back by way of

Baghdad. From Maragheh Ghazan sent his womenfolk ahead to Ujan and spent a few days hunting on the slopes of Mount Sahand; he reached Ujan himself on 2 6 June and two days later inaugurated theyarghu or court of inquiry, which lasted till 18 July. O f the results of this investi gation Rashid al-Din1 mentions only the execution of two obscure officers; it is natural perhaps that he should not refer to the humiliation of Qutlugh-Shah, with whom he was on terms of friendship. According to Maqrizi's2 account, the Il-Khan was with difficulty restrained from putting his commander to death; and the onlookers are said to have rushed at the prisoner and spat in his face. Maqrizi adds that QutlughShah was banished to Gilan; in fact, like the other commanders, he seems to have been sentenced to be beaten with the rod; even Choban, whose conduct had earned and received the Il-Khan's praises, was not excepted from this punishment. On 8 September 1303 Ghazan arrived in Tabriz and had begun war like preparations, presumably for a fourth invasion of Syria, when he was attacked for the second time with some form of ophthalmia. After treatment by his own doctors had failed to cure the disease he finally, on 19 October, had recourse to Chinese physicians (probably in the suite of Bolad Ching-Sang), who cauterized his body in two places, apparently in the abdominal region. He left on 1 November for his winter-quarters in Baghdad; unable to sit a horse on account of the cauterization he was obliged to travel in a litter, averaging little more than three or four miles a day. By 25 November he was on or near the Safid R u d and finding the route southwards to Hamadan to be blocked with heavy snowfalls he abandoned his intention of wintering in Baghdad and made instead for a residence at some unidentified spot on the banks of the river to which he had given the Mongol name of Oljeitii-Nuntuq3 ("Auspicious Encampment"), Here he imposed upon himself the discipline of a chilla, i.e. a forty-day period of retirement, fasting and meditation such as was practised by dervishes and seekers after occult powers. His motives may well have been medical rather than spiritual, for it is clear that the Il-Khan's infirmity—whatever its nature—was no longer a mere inflammation of the eyes.

HISTORY OF THE IL-KHANS
396
It was during this period of seclusion that the "Mazdakite" con spiracy (to which reference will be made elsewhere in this volume)1 was uncovered and suppressed. Ala-Fireng, the eldest son of Geikhatu, whom the conspirators sought to place on the throne, is depicted by Rashid al-Din as playing a purely passive role in their machinations; it is significant, however, that one of the first acts of Ghazan's successor was to order his execution. On 10 January 1304 the Il-Khan emerged from his retreat to take part in the New Year celebrations and to resume the administration of affairs. A few days later Keremiin, the youngest of his wives, died suddenly of a stroke; her death produced a deep im pression on Ghazan, perhaps already conscious of his own approaching end. At the beginning of April, he set out eastwards travelling light and accompanied only by his immediate entourage: the womenfolk had been left, along with the heavy baggage, at a place called Qal'achuq ("Little Castle") on or near the Safid Rud. N o reason is given for this journey: it is possible that the Il-Khan had conceived a desire to revisit his old viceroyalty of Khurasan. His health was apparently fully restored and he was even able to indulge his passion for hunting whilst passing through the Sultan Bulagh hills en route for Saveh. F r o m Saveh, where a feast had been prepared by the vizier Sa'd al-Din, a native of the town, he continued, after a three days' halt, in the direction of Ray. It was at this stage that he suffered a relapse; he forced himself to ride on in spite of his infirmity, but by the time he had reached the district of Khail-i Buzurg between Ray and Qazvin he was critically ill. He sent for his chief and favourite wife Princess Bulughan, whom he had married in defiance of the shari'a in 1294,2 and returning slowly westwards was reunited with her in the district of Pushkil Darra to the east of Qazvin at the beginning of May. Assembling his ministers he exhorted each of them individually and confirmed his previous desig nation of his brother Khar-Banda as his heir. This duty accomplished he passed the greater part of his time in retirement, retaining full possession of his faculties until the end. He died on Sunday, 1 1 May 1304 in the thirty-third year of his life, and his body, transported amid universal mourning to Tabriz, was laid to rest in the Gunbad-i-'AIi, the mausoleum he had himself designed and erected. Ghazan was without question the greatest of the Il-Khans, a remark ably gifted man by the standards of any age of history. What strikes one above all is the catholicity of his interests. He was conversant not only

with arts or sciences such as natural history, medicine, astronomy and chemistry (or more strictly alchemy) but also with several handicrafts. He could, so Rashid al-Din1 assures us, perform the tasks of a goldsmith, a blacksmith, a carpenter, a painter, a founder or a turner more expertly than the masters of these trades. " N o one surpassed him", says Pachymeres,2 " in making saddles, bridles, spurs, greaves and helmets: he could hammer, stitch and polish, and in such occupations employed the hours of his leisure from war." In addition to his native Mongol he was said to have had some knowledge of the Arabic, Persian, Hindi, Kashmiri, Tibetan, Chinese and Frankish (i.e. French or perhaps Latin) languages. Despite his conversion to Islam he took a great interest in the history and traditions of his forefathers, on which he was an authority second only to Bolad Ching-Sang, the representative of the Great Khan. It was, in fact, at his suggestion and with his encourage ment that Rashid al-Din embarked upon the first part of the Jdmf altawdrlkh, " a vast historical encyclopaedia such as no single people, either in Asia or in Europe, possessed in the Middle A g e s " . 3 His measures to reform the fiscal system will be examined elsewhere in this volume.4 In his person he was short and of unprepossessing appearance, in complete contrast to his father Arghun, a tall and handsome man. After describing his gallantry in the Battle of Hims the Armenian Haithon, in a passage already referred to above,5 continues as follows: " A n d the most remarkable thing of all was that within a frame so small, and ugly almost to monstrosity, there should be assembled nearly all those high qualities which nature is wont to associate with a form of symmetry and beauty. In fact amongst all his host of 200,000 Tartars you should scarcely find one of smaller stature or of uglier and meaner aspect than this Prince. " 6
OLJEITU
Through his agents in Ghazan's court Khar-Banda had received early intelligence of his brother's death and had at once taken steps to remove a possible rival. This was his cousin Ala-Fireng, recently involved in the " Mazdakite " conspiracy.7 The unsuspecting prince was struck down

HISTORY OF THE IL-KHÂNS
in the course of a private interview by one of Khar-Banda's emissaries (30 May 1304), himself killed shortly afterwards in a collision with the forces of the Amir Horqudaq. The latter, also apparently regarded as an obstacle in Khar-Banda's path, was captured and summarily executed. Against the deaths of these two men should be set the fact that during the first year of Ghazan's reign no less than ten princes o f the blood had met a violent end: it is possible that the new Il-Khan's prompt if ruthless action may have prevented the recurrence of bloodshed on a similar scale. The way now clear, he set out on the journey from Khurasan to Âzarbâijân. Progress was slow because of the heavy rain falls: he reached Üjân on 9 July, and ten days later the ceremony of enthronement took place still, apparently, with all the traditional rites as observed and described by John de Piano Carpini nearly sixty years before. He assumed the throne name of Öljeitü (in Mongol " Fortunate" or "Auspicious") in addition to that of Khar-Banda (in Persian " A s s Herd") given him either at birth, in accordance with the Mongol custom of naming a child after the first person or object that caught the mother's eye after the confinement, or at a later stage, in accordance with the custom of altering a child's name to protect him against the evil eye. Partly, at least, for euphemistic reasons the name was after wards changed to Khudâ-Banda ("Slave of G o d " , the Arabic 'Ab dalları), the Il-Khân's full title being Ghiyâth al-Din Muhammad Khudâ-Banda Öljeitü Sultan. After three days of feasting Öljeitü turned his attention to affairs of state, confirming Sa'd al-Din and Rashid al-Din in their offices and appointing Qutlugh-Shah his commander-in-chief. On 6 August he left Üjân for Tabriz where, on the following day, he visited his brother's tomb. It was somewhere near Marâgheh, in the Jaghatu valley according to Vaşşâf,1 that he received the ambassadors of the Great Khan Temür, the grandson and successor (1294-1307) of Qubilai, accompanied by those of Chabar, the son of Qaidu, and Du'a, the son of Baraq: the object of this composite mission was to apprise the Il-Khan of a pact that had put an end to the longstanding quarrels between these branches of the House of Chingiz-Khân. From Marâgheh, where he installed Aşil al-Din, the son of Naşir al-Din Tusi, in the observatory founded by his father, Öljeitü made his way to winter-quarters in Müghân, halting en route at Tabriz to pay a second visit to the Gunbad-i 'Âli. In Müghân, on 9 December, he received the ambassadors of

Toqta, the ruler of the Golden Horde, who presumably made some allusion to the reconciliation of the princes of Central and Eastern Asia, of which Toqta also had been informed. T o this development, ap parently betokening the restoration of the Mongol world empire as it had existed under Mongke, Oljeitu refers in a letter addressed to Philippe le Bel, which has been preserved in the French national archives. He begins this letter, written at Ativan (Barzand) in Mughan on 5 April 1305, by affirming this desire to maintain the traditional ties of friendship between the Il-Khans and the "sultans of the Frankish people". He then proceeds: " . . . w e , Temur Qa'an, Toqta, Chabar, Du'a and others, the descendants of Chingiz-Khan, after recriminating one another for forty-five years down to these recent times, have now, protected by Heaven, all of us, elder and younger brothers, reached a mutual agreement, and from the land of the Chinese, where the sun rises, to the sea of Talu [the Caspian, or perhaps the Mediterranean], our states joining with one another [i.e. re-establishing communi cations], we have caused our post stations to be linked together." The letter concludes with a veiled hint at possible concerted action against the Mamluks: " Now, as for those who shall not agree, either with us, or with you, let Heaven decide on the manner in which, by the strength of Heaven, leaguing against them all of us together, we shall take our stand."1 The Il-Khan's meaning, as appears from the contemporary Italian version of the letter^ was intended to be amplified by word of mouth. Oljeitu, in fact, as the Persian authorities explicitly state, had every intention of continuing the anti-Mamluk policy of his predecessors. In December 1305, the Egyptian ambassadors detained by Ghazan were allowed to depart; they were accompanied by Oljeitu's own ambassadors bearing a message to the sultan. That this was not a conciliatory move is clear from the tone of the message as reproduced by Vassaf:2 the Il-Khan wished no doubt to gain time whilst making his own prepa rations and awaiting the response to his appeal to the princes of Christendom. In the meantime he set his hand to the task for which he is chiefly remembered: the building or rather the completion (for the work had been begun by his father Arghun) of a new town on the plain of Qongqur-Oleng to which he (or perhaps already Arghun) had given the name of Sultaniyeh and which, though "neither geographically nor

historically suited for such a high destiny'V he now made his capital. Here was erected his mausoleum, still to this day "one of the most celebrated buildings in the whole of Persia".2 It was from Sultâniyeh that he set out, in May 1307, upon a campaign against, not the Egyptians, but an enemy much nearer home, the people of the Caspian province of Gilân. That this territory, contiguous to the Mongols' summer and winter quarters in Arrân and Âzarbâijân, should still have remained unsubjugated after fifty years of Il-Khânid rule is readily accounted for by the inaccessibility of the country with its dense forests and impenetrable jungles and, above all, humid, un healthy climate. Stung, it is said, by the jeers of the Chaghatai Mongols Öljeitü resolved upon an elaborate military operation against Gilân. Four armies entered the country at four different points: Choban advancing from Ardabil, Qutlugh-Shah from Khalkhâl and Toghan and Mu'min from Qazvin, whilst Öljeitü himself, passing through Târum halted for three days on the slopes of Mount Dulfak, before pushing forward in the direction of Lâhijân. H e was joined en route by Choban, to whom the rulers of Âstârâ and Gaskar had surrendered without a fight. T o g h a n and Mu'min were equally successful in Southern Gilân, and Öljeitü, who had occupied Lâhijân and received the sub mission of its ruler, was in the region of Kühdum on the return journey when he learnt the news of Qutlugh-Shah's defeat and death in battle. Advised at Khalkhâl to proceed with caution in this difficult terrain the commander-in-chief, ignoring counsel so little in keeping with his character, sent on ahead Bolad-Qaya in command of a force which defeated the Gilakis in three bloody battles. The latter then sued for peace, and Qutlugh-Shah was in favour of accepting their submission but was dissuaded by his son Siba'uchi, who seems to have inherited all of his father's impetuosity. Displacing Bolad-Qaya at the head of the advanced forces Siba'uchi carried fire and sword through the land until confronted by a great host of Gilakis on a battle-field of their own choosing between Rasht and Tülim. The Mongols were defeated with great slaughter, their horses sinking in the m u d as they turned in flight. Qutlugh-Shah's own troops withdrew in panic when they heard the news, and he was left with only a handful of men to meet the oncoming enemy: he was killed by an arrow shot, and the triumphant Gilakis possessed themselves of the whole of the immense booty which the Mongols had captured in their territory. Such was the end of this

powerful and headstrong man, the Cotolossa of Haithon: he was a descendant of Jedei Noyan of the Manqut tribe, a general of ChingizKhan. His death carried incalculable consequences for the future of the Il-Khanate; had he survived, the Amir Choban, who now succeeded him as commander-in-chief, might well not have achieved the allpowerful position which he occupied in the following reign. A detach ment sent to avenge this disaster almost met with the same fate; the dispatch of reinforcements caused the Gilakis to disperse into their forests, and, on 29 June Oljeitu struck camp to leave Gilan, having gained what seems to have been at most a Pyrrhic victory over its inhabitants. In the previous year the Il-Khan had dispatched an army against Fakhr al-Din Kart, the malik of Herat, with whom he had clashed during his viceroyalty of Khurasan because of his support for the Nigudaris. Fakhr al-Din closed the gates of the town upon the approach of the Mongol commander, Danishmand Bahadur, but after a few days' siege entered into negotiations, as the result of which he surrendered the town to Danishmand, leaving one of his officers, Jamal al-Din Muhammad Sam, in command of the citadel; he himself withdrew to the neighbouring castle of Aman-Kuh. Whilst visiting the citadel with a small following Danishmand was attacked and killed; the Mongols inside the town were slaughtered and the army outside the walls then withdrew. Reinforcements were sent under the command of Danishmand's son Bujai to avenge his father's death; they invested the town on 5 February 1307. The siege, which lasted till 24 June, is described in considerable detail by Hafiz-i A b r u 1 and Mirkhwand,2 as one would expect of historians writing of their Timurid patrons' capital. Here it is sufficient to say that Fakhr al-Din Kart, who was certainly in collusion with Sam, died in the early days of siege; that a plot to kill Sam and so save the town was betrayed and the conspirators executed; and that Bujai finally negotiated terms of surrender with his father's murderer in order to deny another general the credit of capturing the town. Oljeitu, baptized in infancy with the Christian name of Nicholas, had become in turn a Buddhist and a Sunni (Hanafi) Muslim. Reference will be made elsewhere3 to a curious disputation which took place in his presence, apparently in Arran in the winter of 1307-8, between repre sentatives of the Hanafi and Shafi'I schools, " who, in the heat of controversy, brought against each other such abominable accusations that tJljaytu was greatly annoyed with both, and even the Mongol

nobles who were by no means squeamish, professed disgust, and began to ask whether it was for this that they had abandoned the faith of their ancestors, to which they now called on tJljaytu to return".1 Shortly afterwards, during a violent thunderstorm, several of the Il-Khan's companions were killed by lightning. It was put to him by some of his amirs that he should purify himself according to the ancient Mongol (and indeed Altaic) custom, by passing between two fires ;2 and bakbshis, who must have been, not Buddhist priests but qams or shamans, were produced to supervise the ceremony. They attributed the disaster to Oljeitii's conversion to Islam, which they called upon him to abjure. A return to shamanism was of course altogether out of the question, but his anti-Sunni feelings persisted and he was gradually persuaded to become a Shi'ite, making the final decision after a visit to Najaf in the winter of 1309-10. The vizier Sa'd al-Din Savaji, who had always enjoyed Ghazan's confidence and favour, fell from grace under his successor. The basic cause of his downfall seems to have been an arrogance bred from long years of power; he made enemies, one of whom was his colleague Rashid al-Din; and it was the latter's report to Oljeitu on the pecula tions of his subordinates that led to his arrest and execution (19 Febru ary 1312). He was succeeded in his office by Taj al-Din 'All-Shah, a dealer in jewels and precious stuffs who had insinuated himself into the Il-Khan's good graces; with no previous knowledge of public finance ^ilm4 daftar u siydqaff and in no way more honest than his predecessor, he achieved, in the following reign, the distinction of being the first Il-Khanid vizier to die in his bed. Oljeitu must by now have long abandoned the hope of a European alliance against the Mamluks. There is no record of Philippe le Bel's having answered (or even received) the Il-Khan's letter; but a similar letter addressed to Edward I of England was acknowledged in a letter from his son Edward II dated at Northampton, 16 October 1307, and in a second letter4 dated 30 November and written at Langley the English king replies to what must have been an oral message conveyed by the Il-Khan's ambassadors. He wishes Oljeitu well in his enterprise, which he takes quite naturally, and without necessarily being misled by the envoys, to be the extirpation of the "abominable sect of Mahomet",

but regrets that the distance and other difficulties prevent his co operating in this "laudable design". Pope Clement V , in a letter1 dated at Poitiers, i March 1308, disclosed some of the details of the pro posed alliance: " W e have noticed with pleasure, from these letters and communications, that appealing to our solicitude on behalf of the HolyLand, you have offered us 200,000 horses and 200,000 loads of corn, which will be in Armenia when the army of the Christians arrives there, and in addition to march in person with 100,000 horsemen to support the efforts of the Christians to expel the Saracens from that Holy Land." He expresses his appreciation of the offer, which, he says, "has strengthened us like spiritual food", but makes only a vague reference to future collaboration. He and his brethren, he assures the Il-Khan, " will execute as far as we can what G o d had inspired us to do, and when a favourable season for crossing the sea shall come we will advise you by letters and messengers so that you may accomplish what your magnificence has promised ". It was encouragement from another quarter that prompted Oljeitu's one and only invasion of Mamluk territory. A t Sultaniyeh, in August 1312, he welcomed the arrival of a group of dissident Syrian amirs headed by Qara-Sonqur, the governor of Damascus, and Aq-Qush alAfram, the governor of Tripoli. On Qara-Sonqur, whose Turkish name ("Black Gerfalcon") he changed, on account of his years, to AqSonqur ("White Gerfalcon"), he bestowed the governorship of Maragheh and on al-Afram that of Hamadan; both men accompanied him on a campaign for which they must have convinced him the time was now propitious. Setting out from his capital at the beginning of October he proceeded by way of Mosul, crossed the Euphrates at Qirqisiya and, on 23 December, sat down before Rahbat al-Sham. He had been encouraged by Qara-Sonqur and al-Afram to think that the governor, a protege of the former amir, could be induced to surrender the town. In this he was disappointed: the townsfolk offered fierce resistance, and because of their heavy casualties and lack of provisions the Mongols, on 26 January 1313, raised the siege and withdrew across the Euphrates, never to return. So ended, after a lapse of fifty years, the Mongol-Mamluk struggle for the possession of Syria. That the outcome would have been different had the princes of Europe accepted the proffered alliance cannot seriously be doubted. Nor need we question the sincerity of the Mongols'

promises with respect to Palestine; the restoration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem would have been as much in their interest as was the preser vation of Little Armenia. The views of the Armenian Haithon, dictated in Avignon in 1307 when the question of such collaboration was still under earnest consideration, deserve more attention than has perhaps been accorded them.1 Having captured the district of Tripoli the Christian expeditionary force should, according to the strategy laid out in his work, rebuild the city, make it their base of operations "and thus be ready when the Tartars had completed their conquest of the Holy Land to take over from them the towns there, which he was confident they would make over to the Christians for custody, because they could not endure the heat of the summer in those parts; nor did they fight with the Sultan to conquer more lands, for they were masters of all Asia, but because the Sultan was very unfriendly to them and always doing them some injury, especially when they were at war with the neighbouring Tartars (i.e. those of Kipchak and Jagatai) ".2 There were, of course, disadvantages to an alliance with the Mongols.
If Karbanda, or some one sent by him, should invade Egypt with a very large army, it would be well to avoid him, for the Lord of the Tartars would deem it derogatory to follow the counsel of the Christians, and would insist on their following his commands. Besides which, the Tartars were all mounted and marched rapidly, and a Christian army, much of which marched on foot, could not keep up with them. The Tartars, again, when in small numbers and humble were obsequious, but when in large numbers were overbearing and arrogant, insulting to their allies who were weaker than themselves, and would be found unbearable by the Christians.3
In the event of a large-scale campaign of this sort Haithon recommends that while the Mongols follow their normal route to Damascus the Christian army should advance along a parallel route to Jerusalem. " A n d in this way, because of the distance between them, peace and friendship would be preserved between the Christians and the Tartars... " 4 Some kind of collaboration must in fact have been possible, and it is interesting to speculate what might have happened if, for example, the Crusade of Edward I and Abaqa's invasion of Syria in 1281 had, by accident or design, exactly coincided, instead of occurring nearly ten years apart. In the last years of his reign the Il-Khan's attention was directed

eastwards. His annexation, in 1313, of the Nigudari territories in Southern Afghanistan provoked an invasion of Khurasan by a Chaghatai army led by Kebek, the brother of the khan (Esen-Buqa), Da'ud Khwaja, the ousted Nigudari ruler, and Prince Yasa'ur, a grandson of Baidar, Chaghatai's sixth son. Crossing the Oxus in the middle of January 1314, they inflicted a heavy defeat on the army of Khurasan near the banks of the Murghab, pursuing their fugitive opponents to the gates of Herat. Upon receiving news of this disaster Oljeitu at once set out from Sultaniyeh (18 February 1314), and the enemy withdrew as he approached, recalled, apparently, by Esen-Buqa, who was being hard pressed by the troops of the Great Khan. It was about this time that Oljeitu appointed his son Abu Sa'id to the viceroyalty of Khurasan, a post traditionally held by the heir-apparent, the actual duties being carried out by Abu Sa'id's atabeg, the Amir Sevinch, for the prince was only an eight-year old child. The situation in the East was somewhat eased by the defection of Prince Yasa'ur, accused by Kebek of collusion with the Persian Mongols during the invasion of Khurasan. Oljeitu's troops crossed the Oxus to intervene in a battle between Yasa'ur and the Chaghatai forces and to swing the balance in the former's favour: he accompanied them back into Khurasan, where Oljeitu allowed him to occupy the pasture lands of Badghis and where, as we shall see, he rose in rebellion against Oljeitu's successor. It was the expenses of the army of Khurasan that occasioned the first rift between Rashid al-Din and 'Ali-Shah. A b u Sacid's requests for funds were passed on by Oljeitu to the two viziers. Rashid al-Din disclaimed all responsibility, saying that he had never had the management of the finances nor affixed his seal to assignations made upon the revenue.
" I only possess the robe that covers me, and have not a single coin, and, inasmuch as we govern the empire together," replied Ali-Shah, "why should we separate from one another when it is a question of paying?" "Because you have undertaken that responsibility yourself", said Rashid. " Y o u are the guardian of the Great Seal, and are charged with the carrying out of the Sultan's orders." "Why then not affix your seal after mine?" was the reply. "I do not want to join myself with you who profess poverty when asked for money, while each of your employes has made a hundred tumans and become a Carun... " J
After listening to this dispute Oljeitu ordered the division of his empire into two administrative spheres, Rashid al-Din becoming responsible

for Central and Southern Persia to the confines of Khurasan whilst cAli-Shah was placed in charge of North-western Persia, Mesopotamia and Asia Minor. But even this segregation of their fields of operation failed to restore harmony, and cAli-Shah, having survived an investi gation into his accounts, continued a vendetta which resulted, in the following reign, in his colleague's disgrace and execution. Oljeitu died in Sultaniyeh on 17 December 1316; he was in his thirty-sixth year. The cause of his death seems to have been some kind of digestive disorder brought on by the intemperate habits common to all the Mongol princes (with the exception, if we may believe Rashid al-Din,1 of Ghazan) and aggravated by the excessive administration of astringent medicines. Without his brother's energy and strength of character Oljeitu was an even greater patron of the arts. It was at his suggestion that Rashid al-Din, having completed the first volume of his work, the Ta'rikh-i Gha^anu dealing with the history of the Mongols from the beginnings down to the death of Ghazan, embarked in a second volume upon " the first attempt to record the history of all the great nations of the continent of Eurasia",2 an enterprise which "has not as yet been accorded the recognition it deserves as a unique achievement.. . " . 3 We think of Oljeitu, however, first and foremost as a builder. In addition to Sultaniyeh he constructed, at the foot of Mount Bisitun, a second capital called Sultanabad Chamchimal or simply Chamchimal (Mongol chabchimal " h e w n " ) , of which the ruins still exist and which has given its name to the Chamchamal plain. Mustaufi4 speaks of his interest in the surveying of his dominions: roads were measured and milestones set up and in 1311, presumably when the foundations of Chamchimal were being laid, Mustaufi himself, on the instructions of the Il-Khan and with the assistance of engineers, made a calculation to ascertain the height of Bisitun.

due to the ambition of his atabeg the Amir Sevinch, who for a while had aspired to the post of amir of the ulus or commander-in-chief before conceding the superior claims of the Amir Choban, who had occupied this office ever since the death of Qutlugh-Shah and to whose charge Oljeitü, upon his deathbed, had specifically committed his son. The new Il-Khan retained the services not only of Choban but also of Rashid al-Din and 'Ali-Sháh. The two viziers were still at loggerheads, and 'Ali-Sháh, jealous of the credit his colleague enjoyed with the now all-powerful amir of the ulus, renewed his former intrigues to such purpose that, at the beginning of October 1317, Rashid al-Din was dismissed from office. The Amir Sevinch wished to secure his reinstate ment, but died near Baghdad, where A b ü Sa'id was passing the winter of 1317-18, before he could achieve his object. In the spring, when the Court moved northwards, the Amir Choban summoned Rashid al-Din from Tabriz, where he was living in retirement and persuaded him, against his better judgment, to re-enter the Il-Khán's service: he was, Choban said, as necessary to the state as salt to food. 'All-Shah and his henchmen now redoubled their efforts to discredit him; they accused him of having poisoned the Il-Khan's father; the accusation was believed and Choban, far from defending his protege, seems actually to have assumed the role of prosecutor. Rashid al-Din was put to death on 17 July 1318, having first been made to witness the execution of his son, a lad of sixteen, who, as the cupbearer, was alleged to have actually administered the poison. His death was the signal for the looting of Rubc-i Rashidi, the suburb of Tabriz which he had founded and given his name, and all his lands and property were confiscated by the Diván, even his pious foundations (yaqfs) being robbed of their endowments. His severed head, according to Nuwairi,1 was taken to Tabriz and carried about the town for several days with cries of: " This is the head of the Jew who abused the name of God; may God's curse be upon him!" Such was the ignominious end of the celebrated statesman and historian, "the greatest vizier of the Il-Khan dynasty, and one of the greatest men the East has produced";2 he was a little over seventy years of age. His Jewish origin, denied by some scholars and queried by others, has been fully established by the researches of Fischei3 and Spuler.4

HISTORY OF THE IL-KHANS
Yasa'ur, the Chaghatai prince established in Badghis, had at first professed towards the young ll-Khan a loyalty with which his activities in Khurasan were difficult to reconcile, but early in 1319 he rose in open revolt, and news of his invasion of Mazandaran was received simultaneously with a report that Oz-Beg, the ruler (1313-41) of the Golden Horde, was approaching Darband at the head of a great army. It was decided that the Amir Husain—the father of Hasan-i Buzurg or Hasan the Great, the founder (1336-56) of the Jalayir dynasty—should be sent against Yasa'ur, whilst the Il-Khan marched in person against Oz-Beg. Choban, reviewing his troops near Bailaqan,1 learnt that A b u Sa'id was facing the enemy across the Kur with a force of no more than a thousand men at arms and the like number of grooms, muleteers and camel-men, his advanced forces having retired in disorder upon the mere report of Oz-Beg's approach. It had been Choban's intention to proceed to Khurasan, being alarmed by exaggerated accounts of Yasa'ur's strength; he now hurried to his sovereign's assistance, crossed the K u r at the head of 20,000 men and inflicted heavy losses upon an enemy already in full retreat. The fighting over, disciplinary action was taken against the officers who had deserted their posts: the most culpable were beaten with the rod, a display of severity which was not without its consequences. In 1325 Choban repulsed a second invasion by Oz-Beg and even carried the war into the enemy's own territory. Thirty years later Oz-Beg's son and successor Jani-Beg (1340-57) succeeded where his father had failed and for a brief space of time Azarbaijan was incorporated in the territories of the Golden Horde. Yasa'ur's revolt was soon suppressed. He withdrew from Mazandaran as Husain's forces advanced against him; from Tus he sent an army to invest Herat, where the Malik Ghiyath al-Din had rallied to Choban and the Il-Khan; in April he sat down in person before the town but raised the siege upon the approach of the Il-Khan's army and withdrew into Southern Afghanistan. In the following year he was defeated and killed, not by the Persian Mongols, but by the troops of his Chaghatai kinsman Kebek, who had now succeeded to the Khanate. A rebellion nearer home was of far greater danger. The officers subjected to corporal punishment after the battle with Oz-Beg sought to take their vengeance on Choban; they waylaid him near Lake Sevan in Armenia; he escaped, made his way to Tabriz, and thence to Sultaniyeh. The malcontents, meanwhile, had been joined by the Amir Irenjin, whom Choban had

dismissed from the governorship of Diyarbakr; they collected an army at Nakhchivan and advanced on the capital. A fierce battle was fought near Mianeh (June 1319); the Il-Khan's men were on the point of giving way, when they were rallied by Abu Sa'id's personal inter vention and, returning to the charge, completely routed the enemy. Many of the rebel amirs were killed in the fighting; Irenjin, captured in the village of Kaghadh-Kunan, was taken with two of the other ring leaders to Sultaniyeh, where they were suspended from hooks and fires kindled beneath them. Because of the bravery he had displayed in this battle the young Il-Khan received the title of Bahadur1 ("Hero") and in subsequent firmans and the like his name appeared as al-Sultan al'Adil ("the just Sultan") A b u Sa'Id Bahadur Khan. The fath-nama announcing this victory was issued from Qarabagh, whither Abu Sa'id had betaken himself to pass the winter of 1319-20. For the part he had played in the battle Choban was rewarded with the hand of the Il-Khan's sister, the Princess Sati Beg. The mayor of the palace—for such Choban had by now to all intents and purposes become—had soon to cope with the rebellion of his own son. In 1322 Temur-Tash, appointed viceroy of Rum at the beginning of the reign, proclaimed himself the independent ruler of that province, causing coin to be struck and the khutba to be recited in his name; he gave himself out to be the Mahdi or Messiah whom the Muslims expect at the end of the world and sought the alliance of the Egyptians in the conquest of Persia. With the Il-Khan's permission Choban intervened in person. Though suffering from gout he advanced through the snows of an Anatolian winter to secure his son's surrender; and Temur-Tash was for his father's sake not only pardoned but actually reinstated in his post, in which, attacking now the Turks and now the Greeks, he extended the Mongol conquests to the very shores of the Mediterranean. Early in 1324 occurred the death of the vizier 'Ali-Shah, the first and only holder of his office under the Il-Khans to die of natural causes. He was succeeded in due course by Rukn al-Din Sa'in (Mongol sayin "good"), a protege of Choban, who, however, soon began to intrigue against his benefactor. The latter's power was now at its zenith, and Abu Sa'id was " only king in name ",2 the whole of his dominions being parcelled out amongst Choban and his sons, one of whom, Dimashq

HISTORY OF THE IL-KHANS
Khwaja ("Master Damascus"),1 the viceroy of Azarbaijan and the two 'Iraqs, also exercised the authority nominally vested in Rukn al-Din. A natural impatience with such tutelage was aggravated by the whisperings of the new vizier, the arrogant and dissolute behaviour of Dimashq Khwaja and, above all, a violent passion which the Il-Khan, now in his 21 st year, had conceived for Baghdad Khatun, the latter's sister and the wife of Shaikh Hasan. In accordance with the Yasa2 of Chingiz-Khan the sovereign could exercise a kind of droit de seigneur with respect to any married woman who took his fancy. In Ujan in the late summer of 1325 A b u Sa'id approached the Amir Choban through an intermediary with a view to claiming this right. Without making a direct reply Choban extricated himself from an embarrassing situation by persuading the Il-Khan to pass the following winter in Baghdad and then, after the departure of the Court, dispatching his son-in-law and daughter to Qarabagh. Absence did not, however, have the effect that Choban had expected and Abu Sa'id's feelings for Baghdad Khatun remained unchanged. Early in 1326 the fear of an invasion of Khurasan caused Choban to lead an army to the eastern frontiers, where in the autumn of that year the Chaghatai khan Tarmashirin (1326-34) crossed the Oxus to be defeated by Choban's son the Amir Hasan in a battle near Ghazna. The vizier Rukn al-Din Sa'in had accompanied Choban on this campaign, leaving Dimashq Khwaja in complete and untrammelled control of the administration. Disgusted with his excesses and ashamed of his own complete destitution of authority, the Il-Khan was seeking some opportunity for ridding himself of Dimashq when the pretext was provided by the discovery of an intrigue with a former concubine of Oljeitu; and Dimashq, trapped in the citadel of Sultaniyeh, was killed whilst trying to escape on 25 August 1327. The Il-Khan was now resolved to extirpate the whole race of Choban. The amirs in Khurasan, notified of his intention, at first affected to take the part of their commander-in-chief, who set out westwards to avenge his son. A t Simnan he persuaded Shaikh 'Ala' al-Daula, the local religious leader, to intercede with Abu Sa'id, then encamped near Qazvin. The shaikh's arguments producing no effect Choban continued his march, his troops pillaging and burning as though in enemy

territory, until he reached the village of Quha to the south-east of Ray, only a day's journey distant from the Il-Khan's camp. Here, under cover of darkness, the greater part of his amirs with a force of 30,000 men went over to Abu Sa'id, and in the morning he found himself with no alternative but a rapid withdrawal. He made off in the direction of Saveh, from whence he sent his royal wife, Princess Sati Beg, back to her brother, and then struck eastwards across the desert to Tabas. It had at first been his intention to seek refuge in Transoxiana, but upon reaching the Murghab he changed his mind and made for Herat, where history was to repeat itself almost exactly. Like Nauruz before him, he trusted his life to the Kart ruler and like Nauruz he too was betrayed. Ordered by Abu Sa'Id to execute the refugee, Ghiyath al-Din, though bound by ties of friendship to Choban (as his brother Fakhr al-Din had been to Nauruz), had no choice but to obey. A t his own request Choban was not beheaded but suffered an honourable death by strangulation, a finger of his hand being sent to the Il-Khan as proof of his execution. His last wish that his body should be buried in Medina was carried out under the supervision of his daughter Baghdad Khatun, whom Abu Sa'id had now at last married, having compelled her husband Shaikh Hasan to divorce her. Choban, according to Ibn Battuta, was laid to rest, not in the mausoleum he had caused to be built for himself near the Mosque of the Prophet, but in the famous cemetery of Baqi'. "It was al-Juban", Ibn Battuta1 adds, " w h o had the water brought to Mecca", referring to his restoration of the conduit of Zubaida " with the result that good water became abundant and cheap in Mecca during the Pilgrimage, and plentiful enough to grow vegetables in the city".2 The pious Muslim did not forget his Mongol origins: his son by Princess Sati Beg was called Sorghan Shira after his ancestor the Suldiis tribesman who had helped the youthful Chingiz-Khan to escape from capitivity amongst the Taichi'ut.3 Temur-Tash learnt of his father's death at Qaisariyya; he fled by way of Laranda (now Karaman) into the territories of the Mamluk sultan, who had offered him asylum. A t Cairo he was received at first with every honour but was afterwards imprisoned and put to death (22 August 1328). Nasir, desirous of keeping on good terms with Abu Sacid, found it expedient to execute his guest rather than accede to the Il-Khan's request for his extradition. Had Temur-Tash survived he might, after

the collapse of the Il-Khanid dynasty, have founded a successor state in Anatolia and so hampered and perhaps prevented the rise of the Ottoman empire. "His death", says Grousset,1 "followed seven years later by that of A b ü Sa'id, left Anatolia without a master and liberated the local Turkish amirs, the Qaraman in the South-East and the Otto man in the North-West. Thus the rise of the Ottoman Empire was an indirect consequence of events at the Il-Khánid court in the crucial years 1327-133 5." The duties of vizier were confided, after the death of Dimashq Khwája, to Ghiyáth al-Din, the son of Rashid al-Din, a minister, according to the contemporary historian Mustaufi,2 of such "angelic temperament" that "instead of punishing those who had wrought towards his noble family ill deeds whereof the recapitulation would disgust the hearts of my hearers, he drew the pen of forgiveness through the record of their crimes, recompensed their evil actions with good, and made each one of them an exemplar of the prosperity of this empire, raising them to the highest ranks, and entrusting to them the most important functions..." Such indeed was the vizier's complais ance or simplicity that we find him interceding with the Il-Khan on behalf of the rebellious viceroy of Khurasan, Narin-Taghai, who was plotting his downfall. The execution of Narin-Taghai and his fellow conspirator the Amir Tash-Temiir in September 1329 ended the last serious threat to Abü Sa'id's authority. Three years later Shaikh Hasan-i Buzurg, accused of conspiring with his former wife, Baghdad Khatun, to assassinate her husband, was banished to the castle of Karnakh (the modern Kemah) on the Western Euphrates. He was cleared of the accusation and in 13 3 3 returned to Rüm as viceroy, a post which he still occupied when called to intervene in the struggles that followed Abü Sa'id's death. In the summer of 1335 there were rumours that Oz-Beg was again preparing an invasion of the Il-Khán's dominions. The armies of Baghdad and Diyárbakr were dispatched to Arrán and stationed along the Aq-Su. Abü Sacid followed in person; he died in the Qarabágh area on 30 November 1335, his death being apparently due to poisoning though he had previously been attacked by some epidemic disease. The poison according to Ibn Battüta,3 was adminis tered by Baghdad Khatun, jealous of a younger rival, Dil-Shad Khatun, the daughter of her brother Dimashq Khwája and afterwards the wife

of Shaikh Hasan-i Buzurg and the mother of his son and successor (1356-74) Shaikh Uvais. The last of his line, A b u Sa'Id was in no way degenerate or effete. He is described by Ibn Taghribirdi1 as " a brave and brilliant prince of majestic appearance, generous and witty". He wrote an excellent hand in both the Mongol and the Arabic scripts, was a good musician and composed poetry in Persian, of which two specimens are preserved in the Ta'rikh-i Shaikh Uvais.2, Ibn Taghribirdi also praises him for demolishing churches, though in fact in matters of religion he seems to have con tinued the tolerant policy of his predecessors. It was during his reign that Pope John XII, by a bull dated 1 May 1318, had founded the archbishopric of Sultaniyeh, of which the first incumbent was Francis of Perugia, succeeded in 1323 by William Adam. And if he ignored the pope's exhortation to embrace Christianity he at least paid some attention to his appeal to protect the Christian Armenians against their Muslim neighbours.
T H E C O L L A P S E OF T H E IL-KH AN ID STATE
With the death of Abu Sa'id the House of Hiilegu had become virtually extinct. A prince of another line, Arpa Ke'un,3 a great grand son of Tolui's youngest son Arigh Boke, was raised to the throne as his successor. A Mongol of the old school he showed himself during his brief reign a strong and energetic ruler in complete contrast to the puppets that were to follow him. One of his first acts was to order the execution of Baghdad Khatun, accused of correspondence with the Golden Horde and at least suspected of having poisoned her husband. In the depths of winter he confronted Oz-Beg across the Kur and, by an outflanking movement, put his forces to flight. Returning from this victory he consolidated his position by marrying Princess Sati Beg, the sister of A b u Sacid and the widow of Choban; at the same time he put to death several Chingizid princes whom he saw as possible rivals. He had reckoned, however, without 'All Padshah, the Oirat governor of Baghdad, who proclaimed a new khan, Musa, a grandson of Baidu, and took up arms against Arpa. A battle was fought on the Jaghatu on 29 April 1336; Arpa fled, defeated, was captured in Sultaniyeh and

brought to Ujan, where, on 15 May, he met his end at the hands of the son of one of his own victims. His vizier Ghiyath al-Din, the son of Rashid al-Din, was already dead, having been executed by the amirs against 'All Padshah's wishes. It was now that Shaikh Hasan-i Buzurg intervened in the struggle for power, setting up as his own claimant a great grandson of MengiiTemiir, a young child called Muhammad. A battle between the rival khans in the Ala-Tagh area (24 July) resulted, through an act of treachery on the part of Shaikh Hasan, in the defeat of Musa and the death of 'Ali Padshah. After pursuing Musa in the direction of Baghdad and inflicting heavy losses on his followers Hasan accompanied Muhammad to Tabriz, where he fixed his residence and where he married Princess Dil-Shad, the favourite wife of Abu Sa'id, who had recently borne him a posthumous child—a daughter. Meanwhile the amirs in Khurasan, hostile to Shaikh Hasan, had elected their own khan, Togha-Temiir, a descendant in the sixth generation of Chingiz-Khan's brother Jochi-Qasar. Under his leadership they undertook the conquest of Azarbaijan and 'Iraq-i 'Ajam, arriving in March 1337, before Sultaniyeh. Shaikh Hasan judged it prudent to withdraw from Tabriz into Arran, and the Khurasanis proceeded to overrun the greater part of 'Iraq, clashing with Musa's men and finally making common cause with them against Shaikh Hasan. The two princes encountered their opponent in the Maragheh area, at Soghurluq, according to the Tarikh-i Shaikh Uvais,1 on 15 June. For some unexplained reason Togha-Temiir at once retired from the battlefield and did not draw rein until he had reached Bistam. Musa for his part stood firm and gave a good account of himself, but was none the less defeated, captured in flight and taken to Shaikh Hasan, by whom, on 10 July, he was put to death. Despite his apparently pusillanimous conduct Togha-Temiir maintained control over Khurasan and Mazandaran, while Shaikh Hasan's authority in Azarbaijan and 'Iraq was challenged from an altogether unexpected quarter. His new antagonist was another Shaikh Hasan, the son of TemiirTash and the grandson of Choban, called Shaikh Hasan-i Kuchak or Shaikh Hasan the Little to distinguish him from his namesake. T o advance his cause Hasan-i Kuchak conceived the idea of passing off a Turkish slave as his father Temiir-Tash who, he claimed, had escaped from prison in Egypt and had wandered for several years in distant

lands. By this pretence he attracted to his party both the supporters of the Choban family and also the Oirat tribesman who had fought under Musa. Advancing under the banners of his spurious father he engaged Hasan-i Buzurg at a place called Naushahr ("New T o w n " ) in the AlaTagh area on 16 July 1338. The latter, deceived by a ruse of Hasan-i Kuchak, withdrew on Tabriz leaving in the lurch his protege, the young khan Muhammad, who was captured and killed. The pseudo-Temur-Tash now thought to exploit this victory to his own advantage. He attempted to assassinate Hasan-i Kuchak, who, however, escaped and made his way to Georgia; he then advanced on Tabriz, hoping to occupy the town before his secret became known. He was defeated by Hasan-i Buzurg and, joining the Oirat whom the latter had expelled from Sultaniyeh, accompanied them to their en campment in the Baghdad region. Meanwhile Hasan-i Kuchak, who had joined Princess Sati Beg in Arran, proclaimed that lady, the sister of A b u Sa'Id and the widow of his grandfather, as khan and advanced against his rival. The latter fell back on Qazvin, and Hasan-i Kuchak's forces occupied Azarbaijan; Hasan-i Buzurg then launched a counter attack, but before they actually came to blows an uneasy peace had been patched up between them. The advantage now being with his opponent Shaikh Hasan-i Buzurg tried another tack: he offered the throne of Abu Sa'id to Togha-Temur, who arrived in cIraq-i cAjam with his following in January or February 13 39. By a Machiavellian ruse Hasan-i Kuchak succeeded in so discrediting this prince that he withdrew into Khurasan in the early summer. Hasan-i Buzurg then set up yet another khan, Jahan-Temur, the son of Ala-Fireng and grandson of Geikhatu. Hasan-i Kuchak, not to be outdone, deposed Princess Sati Beg and re placedher by Sulaiman, a great grandson of Hulegii's third son Yoshmut, whom he forced her to marry. The two Hasans with their rival khans met in battle on the Jaghatu at the end of June 1340: Hasan-i Buzurg was defeated and fled to Baghdad, where he deposed Jahan-Temiir and himself assumed sovereignty as the founder of the Jalayir dynasty.1 The deposition of Jahan-Temiir may be regarded as the final dis solution of the ll-Khanid state. His rival, it is true, retained his nominal power a year or two longer, surviving the death2 of his protector, but

then he too was deposed by Hasan-i Kuchak's brother and, like JahanTemiir, vanishes into obscurity. So insignificant had these figureheads become that we are not even informed as to the time and manner of their death. The same applies to another puppet, Anushirvan, of Persian, Turkish or Il-Khanid origins, who replaced Sulaiman in 1344 and in whose name his Chobanid masters continued to strike coin until 1353. In the latter year Togha-Temiir, the last of the Persian Chingizids, was killed by the first of the Sarbadars of Sabzavar, who, along with the Jalayirs in Baghdad and Tabriz, the Muzaffarids in Fars and the Karts in Herat, were to fill the vacuum left by the Il-Khans until the advent, towards the end of the century, of another Mongol or semi-Mongol conqueror, Timur,1 born, by a curious coincidence, in the same year in which Abu Sa'id died. The Il-Khans, and before them the viceroys of the Great Khan, had dominated Western Asia for a period of more than 100 years. The economic decline of that region, induced by the havoc of the invasion, aggravated by the taxation policy of the earlier rulers and only partially arrested by the reforms of Ghazan will be examined elsewhere2 in this volume. Here is perhaps the place to consider the more positive con sequences of Mongol rule. Unlike the Saljuqs, who entered the Iranian world already converted to Islam and with their backs turned upon their Oghuz past, the Mongols, whilst gradually abandoning their shamanist, Christian or Buddhist beliefs, never forgot their historical origins or severed their ties with their kinsmen in Eastern, Central and Northern Asia. The persistence of national feeling amongst their conquerors may well have strengthened the Persians' own sense of nationalism, reinforcing the effect of what Minorsky has called the " Iranian intermezzo", i.e. the period between the withdrawal of the Arabs and the arrival of the Ghaznavids and Saljuqs, an "interval of Iranian domination" but for which "the national tradition would have become blunted and the Safavids would have found it infinitely more difficult to restore the particular moral and cultural character which distinguishes Persia from her Muslim neighbours " . 3 Certainly this process of differentiation must have been greatly facilitated by the existence, for almost a century, of a centralized state occupying approximately the same area as the Sassanian
1 Strictly speaking Temiir (in Turkish " I r o n " ) , the Taimur/Teimur usual in Middle Eastern countries and even the conventional European Tamerlane representing the original pronunciation more closely than the Orientalist's Timur. 2 See below, chapter 6. 8 Studies in Caucasian History, p. n o n. 1.



THE COLLAPSE OF THE I L - K H A N I D STATE
empire and entering, for the first time since the Sassanians, into direct relations with the Christian West. The fact that Persian, under IlKhanid patronage, now finally displaced Arabic as the vehicle of historical writing must also have encouraged nationalistic tendencies. But perhaps the greatest, if the least tangible, benefit of Mongol rule was the widening of Persia's horizons. Situated on the communication routes between East and West, Il-Khanid Iran was exposed to the influence of both China and Europe. The first Chinese to reach Persia seem to have been artillery men—mangonel experts—in the armies of Chingiz-Khan and Hiilegu. Among the " numerous company of wise men from various countries " x that were gathered around Nasir al-Din Tusi in his Maragheh observatory was one Fu Meng-chi who explained to him the principles of Chinese astronomy. There were, as we have seen, Chinese physicians at the Court of Ghazan. Chinese artists, operating for the most part, we must presume, in the Buddhist temples, were to leave an indelible impression upon Persian miniature painting. European contacts were mainly in the fields of commerce and diplo macy. Since the reign of Hiilegu Italian merchants had been established in Tabriz, where they remained and prospered until after the death of Abu SacId; it was from their numbers that the Il-Khans recruited their ambassadors and interpreters for the various missions to Europe; the most famous of them, the Polos, escorted from China to Persia a Mongol princess destined to be the bride of Ghazan. There is some evidence of the employment of European artisans: in the correspond ence of Rashid al-Din2 there is a letter addressed to his son, then governor on the Byzantine frontier, asking for the dispatch of twenty weavers, apparently to be purchased as slaves from a Cypriot slavedealer. O f intellectual relations the only concrete evidence is Rashid al-Din's History of the Franks, which is based on a Latin work translated for him by some unknown scholar, perhaps a monk or friar resident in Tabriz. The collapse of the Il-Khanid state followed by the rise of the Ming in Eastern and the Ottomans in Western Asia brought an end to all such intercourse. Had Ghazan lived longer or had he shed less royal blood at the commencement of his reign, relations with Europe would have been continued and perhaps intensified with incalculable con sequences for the future. What is certain is that the Middle East would today bear an altogether different aspect if the House of Hiilegu had retained its full vigour for a decade or two longer.

In the midst of states held together by direct military power alone, the Ismä'Ilis—or "Assassins of Alamüt"—formed a challenging exception. From 483/1090 to 654/1256, they maintained a vigorous state of their own. Their state was small and widely scattered territorially, but it retained its cohesiveness throughout a series of upheavals that would have disrupted most polities, and it was strong enough to resist

successfully the relentless enmity of the rest of Muslim society. In the cultural life of the time, moreover, the Isma'ili state played a perceptible role—even to the point of acting as host to prominent non-Isma'ili intellectuals. We cannot yet trace all the sources of its vitality, but we can make out some of them. The student of Isma'ili history is faced with problems that do not arise in the study of most dynasties. N o Isma'ili chronicles have sur vived intact. We must depend on the Sunni chroniclers, who were most of them blindly hostile to, and ignorant of, Isma'ili internal developments. The most important exception is Rashid al-Din Fadl Allah, who was not only fair-minded but excerpted extensively the Isma'ili chronicles surviving in his time.1 But the hostility of the chroniclers is a less serious obstacle than our ignorance of the institu tions and intellectual assumptions of the Isma'ilis. T o understand the conditions prevailing among Sunni Muslims, we have access to a large body of literature which has been preserved in the Sunni tradition. The Isma'ili tradition has preserved very little from that period—only a few doctrinal works. Often we are at a loss to understand what a given event meant in its Isma'ili context, even when we are tolerably sure of the date of the event and some of its more visible features. Y e t we understand better now than we used to. Earlier Western scholarship, basing itself on the impressions of the Crusaders as well as on the Sunni tradition, was inclined to see in the Isma'ilis a romantically diabolic "order of assassins", not quite human in their fanatical subservience to an enigmatic but self-seeking and all-powerful master, the " O l d Man of the Mountain". This picture can no longer be taken seriously. A s we use such Isma'ili materials as are available and learn to sift the chronicles more cautiously, it proves to be chiefly legendary. But the reality that is emerging turns out to be almost as extraordinary as the legend. That this handful of villagers and small townsmen, hopelessly outnumbered, should again and again reaffirm their passionate sense of grand destiny, reformulating it in every new historical circumstance with unfailing imaginative power and persistent courage—that they should be able so to keep alive not

only their own hopes but the answering fears and covert dreams of all the Islamic world for a century and a half—this in itself is an astonishing achievement. T o comprehend it at all, we must understand the vital religious convictions out of which it grew.1
THE ISMÀ'ÌLÌ MOVEMENT UNDER THE GREAT SALJUQS
Shi'is had never been satisfied with the compromises of official Muslim life, which Sunnis had accepted as more or less inevitable up to a point. Shfis held fast to the hope that, if only Muslims would accept divinely approved leadership, then the high Islamic ideals of equality and godliness among the faithful and an equitable order throughout mankind could be realized in practice. Loyalty to the house of 'Ali had early become identified with such hopes : the true imams (leaders of the Muslim community) were specially designated descendants of 'Ali. Those who maintained loyalty to these imams considered themselves a Muslim élite (Jkhàss) : they alone were true to the real principles of Islam, while the common mass was led astray by temporary appearances of power on the side of other claimants to authority, whom God had not authorized. For many Shi'is it readily followed that the true imams were not merely the proper rulers of the world. The imams, even if unrecognized, represented God's will in the world at all times. Whether in power or not, they were divinely guided to the proper interpretation of religious truths ; their interpretation of Qur'àn and of the law was alone binding on Muslims. Indeed, without the insight which originated with the imam, who in turn had inherited it from the Prophet, the text of the Qur'àn could be quite misunderstood by the ordinary unthinking Muslim ; for behind the literal reference of its words lay a deeper meaning, more or less symbolical, which only the imam could

elucidate with authority. But only the elite, wholly devoted to Islam, could recognize the special role of the imams or appreciate the spiritual insight which resulted from their teaching. Exposure of these sacred matters before the common Sunnis would not enlighten them but might rather lead to profanation and persecution of the imam's cause. Until the time was ripe for all mankind to see the truth, Shi'is were invited to exercise taqiyya (pious dissimulation), disguising their true convictions under a seeming conformity to the standards of the world. Only at the end of the age, with God's aid, would the imam appear, in triumph, to vindicate his true adherents, and set the world to rights. Among the several Shi'I movements, that of the Isma'ilis was distinguished by being organized hierarchically and secretly. Isma'ilis recognized Isma'il son of Ja'far al-Sadiq, and Isma'il's son, as the authorized imams. But for many years the imams were held to be in hiding and inactive. Meanwhile, the organization seems to have been self-perpetuating. Adherents were ranked in several grades, in prin ciple according to the degree to which they had advanced in the esoteric teachings ascribed to the imam. A n adherent of an upper rank was set over adherents of a lower rank in his own area. Set over all adherents in a given province was the dd'i, or head of religious teaching. The whole organization was kept secret on the principle of taqiyya. Among Isma'ilis this taqiyya was more far-reaching than among most Shi'is: the adherent was initiated in a special ceremony and forbidden under oath to reveal anything about the teachings or membership of the community. The doctrine presented as the inner meaning, the bdtin, of the Qur'an was correspondingly more elaborate. Whereas for some Shi'is it went little beyond the identification of various Qur'anic phrases as symbolic references to the imam and to the Shi'is' loyalty to him, for Isma'ilis a whole spiritual cosmos was to be traced in the Qur'an by those who held the clue—not only in the immediate symbolism of its words but in an extensive set of numerical corre spondences. T o be an Isma'ili was to share in the secrets of the universe. The historical origin of the hierarchism and secrecy of the Isma'ilis is not clear, but in any case they made possible two things as disquieting to Sunnis as they were heartening to many Shi'is: a proliferation of cosmological and historical speculation, often rather sophisticated, without regard to its intelligibility to the masses; and at the same time

an extensive preparation of disciplined cadres to support any political move which the leadership should find desirable.1 After the triumph of Ismä'ill power in Egypt in 257/969, when the Fätimid dynasty of caliphs was established, Ismä'ili hopes everywhere were high. Some Ismä'ills may once have doubted the claims to the imamate put forward by the leader of that section of the Ismä'ili movement which now seemed to be blessed with success. But soon almost all Ismä'ills rallied to the Fätimid line. Throughout Iran they recognized the Egyptian Fätimids as the true 'Alid imams, descendants of Ismäcil and entitled, as custodians of the spiritual inheritance of the Prophet, to exclusive obedience among all Muslims. The imam had at last appeared in power. As Fätimid arms were attended with victory in Syria and the Hijäz, and as Fätimid prestige and naval power ensured the new caliph's recognition from Sicily to Sind, Ismäcilis could hope that the promised days were at hand, when the imäm was to reunite the Muslims, overwhelm the infidels, and " fill the earth with justice as it is now filled with injustice", the long-standing dream of all Shi'is. N o w the whole movement was focused in Cairo at the Fätimid court, under the direction of the chief däci there. Dä'Is in the Iranian highlands seem to have been responsible to the chief dä'I in points of doctrine and in planning overall strategy for the victory of the Ismäcili cause in their area—a victory identified with submission to the Egyp tian caliphate. Efforts were made to convert local rulers, many of whom were in any case Shi'I in the tenth and early eleventh centuries, or to find support for military coups on behalf of the imäm. A s the result of one such coup, Baghdad itself was held briefly in the name of the Fätimid caliph. When an Ismä'ili propagandist was ready to retire from such activities, or to withdraw from them for a time, he went to Cairo, where a number of Iranian Ismä'ili philosophers, commonly persecuted at home, ended their lives as respected officials. Indeed, the intellectual leadership of Cairo was largely of Iranian origin. But after the rise of Saljuq power, confidence in Egypt could not but be undermined. In Iran, the several localized dynasties established in

Buyid times were replaced by a single strong power, ardently Sunni. The Egyptian government itself was manifestly weakening; under al-Mustansir in the 1060s it went through a period of internal chaos which paralysed its foreign policy. After this crisis, from 468/1074 on, the government was directed by a military man, Badr al-Jamali, who kept the imam under his control. His foreign policy was defensive, and it was clear that he did not expect the Egyptian government to recover the lead it had once had. Its power remained visibly inferior to that of the Saljuqs during the rest of the eleventh century. The promised days of victory and justice seemed indefinitely postponed. But the Isma'Ili movement in Saljuq lands, and especially in the Iranian highlands, continued as strong as and perhaps stronger than it was before the Egyptian Fatimids appeared and stirred the temporary hope of victory by way of their armies. Isma'Ilis seem to have been numerous in towns in all parts of Iran, but in this period we have evidence of them in the countryside only in a few areas. Many are re ported to have been craftsmen and some appear as merchants; they were often led by men of the liberal professions. They made many con verts among common soldiers and occasionally among lesser officers. It is easier to tell what they opposed than whether they had any very concrete positive plans. We have a few details which suggest dislike of the Turks, not surprising among Iranian and Arab populations whom military rule must have irked. (Hasan-i Sabbah is reported as saying the Turks were jinn> not men.) Certainly, at least in a generalized way, they stood against the social injustice of a stratified society, which the occu pation by Turkish troops seemed to aggravate; there is a story that the Isma'ilis boasted of assassinating a vizier (Nizam al-Mulk) in revenge for his treatment of a carpenter—who was thus drastically asserted to be his equal. Finally, and perhaps most important, it is clear from the nature of their propaganda that they despised and resented the pettiness and aridity of the personal outlook sometimes encouraged by that sban'a-minded Islam which was taught in the multiplying Sunni madrasas. The Isma'ilis were resisting the Sunni intellectual and moral synthesis that is often regarded as the glory of the age—an age then being introduced by the Sunnis after the victory of Sunni power over the various Shi'i dynasties. Iranian Isma'ilis, in their struggle with the spirit of the age, did not have to look so far as Egypt to find the means of some sort of co-ordina tion of their activities. The Isma'ilis of the upper Oxus valleys, beyond

the Saljuq presence, had, at least at one time, a local da'I independentlyresponsible to Cairo; at any rate they do not seem to have been involved, at least at first, in the movements which took place among the Isma'Ilis in the Saljuq lands. But many, if not most, of the Isma'Ilis under Saljuq rule seem to have owned the authority of a single superior da'I, whose headquarters were at Isfahan, the chief Saljuq capital. We know that 'Abd al-Malik-i 'Attash, da'I at Isfahan in the 1070s, was head of the movement throughout the west Iranian highlands, from Kirmari to Azarbaijan, if not beyond. We do not know whether any da'Is for Khurasan and Kuhistan or for Iraq or the Jazlreh were subordinated to him. It does appear that the Syrian Isma'Ilis, even though their province was being occupied by the Saljuqs, were not placed under Isfahan. But 'Abd al-Malik-i 'Attash was respected for his scholarship even in Sunni circles, and seems to have been a focus of widespread renewed Isma'Ili activity in the Saljuq dominions.1 During the 1080s the Isma'Ilis of the Saljuq lands were preparing active insurrection on an unprecedented pattern. Before any overt moves were made, the Isma'Ilis at Saveh in 'Iraq-i 'Ajam were accused of murdering a muezzin lest he betray their secrets. More than one dedicated young man was sent to Egypt and came back ready to seize a fortress in revolt. By 483/1090, revolt broke out simultaneously in Dailam and Kuhistan, and in the next few years in many other areas as well. This time the Isma'Ili hopes were not concentrated on a great army to sweep over all the Muslim lands from a single centre, on the model of the rise of the Egyptian Fatimids. N o w they were looking to a multiplicity of risings everywhere at once, to overwhelm the established social structure from within.
1. R E V O L T
The Isma'Ilis of the Iranian highlands and the Fertile Crescent were not destined to overthrow the Saljuqs but rather to found a society apart, which was set over against Muslim society as a whole. We shall trace the fate of this society in four phases, each representing a new departure in their relations with the outside world. After the failure of the initial revolt came the second period, that of stalemate, in which the Isma'Ilis were regrouped on a more permanent basis. From this basis they went

on, in a third period, to attempt a spiritual defiance, consummating their apocalyptic vision among themselves on the level of the inward life. Later yet, as history impinged even on their inwardness, they dreamed of world leadership in a quest which sent their envoys far beyond the old Saljuq territories, and which was terminated only by a special effort of the all-conquering Mongols. But the first and decisive moment was that of their great revolt.
Hasan-i Sabbáh at Alamñt
The role of any one man in great historical events is hard to isolate and is limited at best. In the case of Hasan-i Sabbáh, the most famous figure in the revolt, we have even less basis than usual for judging the role he played. Y e t the accounts present him as more than just an ordinary leader, and his personality may well have offered the other Ismá'ílis a crucial rallying-point of unyielding strength. In any case, our story must revolve about him if only because he is the only figure about whom we have even moderately detailed evidence. Hasan-i Sabbáh tells us, in an autobiographical passage, that he was brought up as a Shfi, but that he had supposed Isma'ilism was just heretical philosophy till a friend whom he respected for his uprightness convinced him—without at first revealing himself as an Isma'Ili—that the Isma'Ili imam was the true one. Even so, Hasan hesitated to commit himself in the face of the popular opprobrium which the Ismá'ílis suffered. Only after an illness that had seemed fatal, when he thought he would die without having acknowledged the true imam, did he seek out an Isma'Ili propagandist and become initiated.1 He came to the attention of 'Abd al-Malik-i 'Attásh in due time, and was appointed to a post in the Isma'Ili organization and sent to Egypt, arriving there in 471/1078. On the way, he had to make a detour in southern Syria because of Turkish military operations at the very doorstep of the imam. What we have about his experiences in Egypt, then under the rule of Badr al-Jamali, seems to be mostly legendary, but he did not see the imam himself and he cannot have been much encouraged to rely on Egyptian power to achieve anything for the Iranians in their own confrontation with Turkish military power. When he came back to Iran after two years, he set out on extensive travels throughout the west Iranian highlands, presumably

propagandizing and getting acquainted with local circumstances. In the later 1080s he is represented as seeking an appropriate base for carrying out his part in the Isma'Ili revolt that was to come. We do not know whether this work was still under the direction of 'Abd al-Malik-i 'Attash, but this is likely, for his repute in the Sunni chronicles suggests he was still chief da'I in that period. Eventually Hasan was appointed da'I of Dailam, potentially an important post since that was one of the few regions where the bulk of the population were already Shi'i. He chose the fortress of Alamut in Rudbar (the valley of the Shahrud) in the Alburz [Elburz] mountains north of Qazvin as his base (see the map of Rudbar and vicinity, p. 431). He won over the garrison to his views by way of secret emissaries, infiltrated the place with converts from elsewhere, and finally arrived himself under a pseudonym. The commandant, realizing the danger, had feigned conversion so as to ferret out the Isma'Ili leaders and get rid of them, but he had shown his hand too soon and now found him self impotent. Forced to come to terms with Hasan, he accepted a check in payment for the fortress and left. The date was 483/1090. Both Isma'Ilis and Sunnls regarded this as the first great blow in the revolt. A t about the same time, and at least partly inspired from Alamut, the Isma'Ilis of several small towns in Kuhistan, the arid lands south of Khurasan, declared their independence from the Saljuqs. Taking advantage of insults made by a Saljuq amir to the locally respected Simjurid family, they identified their cause with local self-respect, and seem to have won solid support in the population. When it became apparent that the local amirs could not cope with the Isma'Ilis either at Alamut or in Kuhistan, larger Saljuq forces were sent in 485/1092 against them in both places. A t Alamut the Isma'Ilis were few in number at the moment, but some 300 Isma'Ilis were brought in from around Kazvin and Ray for the emergency, and the reinforced garrison, supported by Isma'Ilis from other parts of Rudbar, was able to make a sally against the Saljuq forces. The Saljuqs were defeated and withdrew. Before they could make a new effort, first the vizier Nizam al-Mulk was assassinated and then Malik-Shah himself died. The Saljuq force in Kuhistan concentrated on one small town, Dareh, but failed to take it before Malik-Shah's death led to the break up of the expedition. The Isma'Ilis had established permanent footholds.1 Alamut was physically a large towering rock, with steep slopes hardly

negotiable on most sides, but with a considerable expanse at its top where extensive building could be done. Situated in mountainous ter rain, its approaches could be guarded with relative ease. Yet it was strategically placed, commanding the shortest passage between Qazvin and the Caspian coast, while control of Rudbar as a whole could permit harassment of the main route between all 'Iraq-i cAjam and the Caspian. The Dailami inhabitants of the area had been long noted for their military capabilities as well as for their Shi'i inclinations. It was not the first time Alamut had served as a rebel's stronghold.1 In the years following 485/1092, while intestine Saljuq quarrels gave the Isma'Ilis a respite, Hasan-i Sabbah made Alamut as impregnable as possible. He strengthened the fortifications and built up a great store of provisions. It is said he caused vast storerooms to be hollowed out in the rock, in which large amounts of food could be kept in good condition for a long time—presumably largely cut off from air and especially from warmth. He also took care to arrange irrigation for the fields immediately around Alamut. Physically, Alamut became as nearly self-sufficient as might be, ready to resist an indefinite siege. Likewise the mood of Alamut became martial. Personally, Hasan set an austere example. Once he had taken up residence there, he is said to have left the four walls of his house only twice, and twice to have gone up on the roof; he spent his time writing and directing operations.

He had his two sons executed, one on the charge of murder (which later proved false) and the other on that of wine-drinking; he sent away his wife and daughters to spin along with other women in a distant fortress at a time of difficulty, and never brought them back. It is said that Isma'ili chiefs followed his precedent and never had their women with them while they were executing military command, in contrast to usual Muslim practice. Though Alamut was probably not the official centre of the movement at first, it was in a position to offer leadership at need. Once Alamut was secured and much of Kuhistan independent, the rising proceeded rapidly. A year before Malik-Shah's death, another fortress had been seized (in 484/1091): Sanamkuh near Abhar, in the mountains westward from Qazvin. On Malik-Shah's death (485/1092), the quarrels between Berk-Yaruq and Tutush and then Muhammad Tapar called troops away from any efforts they might have made against the Isma'ilis; moreover, they created just the conditions of uncertainty and disorder in which the Isma'ills found numerous opportunities for action and also, perhaps, a more sympathetic hearing for their message of resistance against the Turkish rulers.

Within a few years the Isma'Ilis held strongholds in a number of mountainous zones in the Iranian highlands. (See the map of the Isma'ili state.) Along with Alamut and some neighbouring places at the western end of the Alburz, they seized at least two other places of defence at the eastern end of that range. In Kuhistan—not a mighty mountain range yet mountainous enough and relatively inaccessible in central Iran just east of the deserts—they controlled a group of towns extending north and south over 200 miles. In the Zagros range, especially in the south around Arrajan, they seized several forts at key spots. In 488/1095, a captain said to be an Isma'ili was entrusted with the town of Takrit on the Tigris, north of Baghdad; but this town does not seem to have become Isma'ili in sentiment. Less decisive Isma'ili activity is reported from many towns throughout the area of Saljuq rule—even where fortresses were not seized, the Isma'Ilis became an active faction in the cities, even, as in Kirman and Aleppo, winning the support of Turkish amirs themselves, at least for a time.1
The new doctrine
The official Isma'ili doctrine at Cairo had developed into a complex and sophisticated cosmological system, in which one might think the only role of the da'Is and other ranks in the organization was to learn and teach a proliferating stock of esoteric lore. All this learning was certainly not rejected by those Isma'Ilis who were launching the rebellion. But observers got the impression that there was a "new teaching" associated with the movement which could be contrasted with the old; and this would not be surprising. If there was, however, it was not a wholly new system but a new emphasis and development of a doctrine of long standing among Isma'Ilis and indeed among Shi'is generally: the doctrine of /#'//>//, authoritative teaching. Those Sunnis who were most closely acquainted with the Isma'ili movement at the time concentrated on this doctrine as the main Isma'ili thesis, and later Isma'ili writings refer to the doctrine in contexts which likewise associate it with the time of the revolt. In its fully developed form, the doctrine is ascribed in particular to Hasan-i Sabbah, who expounded it in a Persian essay. But we cannot assume that he is the one who de veloped it; 'Abd al-Malik-i 'Attash, for instance, was intellectually

active and was more prominent than Hasan at the time when the doctrine was first taken notice of; but we have no writings of his to go by.1 The Shi'is had always condemned the Sunnis for presuming to choose for themselves in religious questions—starting with the choice of A b u Bakr as first caliph, admittedly not designated by Muhammad as his successor, whereas the Shi'is were sure that 'All had been divinely indicated as the successor. Then the Sunnis had continued, in the Shi'i view, to interpret religious truth and in particular the shari'a law arbitrarily, according to their own sense of propriety: they even called the founders of their great schools of law imams, though these founders could claim no special status except that which resulted from the respect accorded them by their own followers. The Shi'is, in contrast, claimed to base their understanding of religious truth and law on the teaching of true imams, designated not by human choice but (like the Prophet himself) by divine election. If Islam could be founded only by divine authority, surely it must be interpreted also by divine authority. Men were no more in a position to decide on ultimate truth in subsequent times than in the time of Muhammad himself. Accordingly, over against the Sunni systems of determining law the Shi'is set their own doctrine, that one must seek the only authoritative teaching, ta'lim, that of the authoritatively designated 'Alid imams. As to how Muslims were to know who was the true imam, Shi'is were not at a loss to adduce evidentiary miracles; but every sophisti cated person knew how limited the evidentiary strength of any wonder is; hence on a sophisticated level the Shi'i case was really made to rest on history. If one were once convinced, by the logic of the situation, that a true imam must have been designated (for G o d would not be so inconsistent as to appoint a prophet and then leave mankind in the dark as to the imams to come after him), then one looked for any relevant indications; and it was not hard to find anecdotes about the Prophet which could be construed as designating 'All to succeed him. 'AH in turn, and each of the other imams, could be assumed to have designated his own successor. But such a proof of the imam's identity is by no means rigorous. Moreover it presupposes that one has already accepted Muhammad as Prophet. In Hasan's book, mentioned by several writers and sum

THE NEW DOCTRINE
marked for us by Shahrastani, this argument was transformed into an incisive and self-contained instrument for validating the Isma'IlI position regardless of one's prior commitment. Hasan's work estab lished four propositions. First, either one needs a teacher to know ulti mate truth—truth about God—or one does not; but if not, one has no grounds for preferring one's own speculations to those of another, since this is implicitly to teach the other, or at least to accept one's own authority in preference to his. With this proposition, the position of Muslims generally was asserted against philosophers who denied the need for any authority at all. The second proposition was that either the required teacher must be authoritative, or any teacher will do; but if any teacher will do, we are in as bad a situation as if we had no teacher at all, for we have no ground for preferring one teacher to another. With this proposition, the Ships' insistence on authoritative teaching, ta'lim, was asserted against the Sunnis, who, in any given generation, must depend on a host of learned men none of whom is inherently more authoritative than the others. But Hasan's third proposition brought out the weakness of the ordinary Shi'Is themselves. Either the authority of the authoritative teacher must be proved or any teacher may be accepted as authoritative, which would leave us where we were before; but how can his authority be proved except on the basis of some further authority?—which authority would have to be proved in turn. With the fourth proposition, Hasan showed how the authority of the final teacher could be known not through something beyond itself but by way of the structure of knowledge itself. All true knowledge requires a contrast of two opposites, which can be known only through each other; thus we can conceive the (Aristotelian) "necessary" only by contrast to what is merely possible—and the "possible" only by contrast to what is inherently necessary. Neither can be conceived without the other. Again, in the phrase "no god but G o d " , the unique God can be conceived properly only by contrast to the many godlings; while we see the inanity of these godlings only by contrast to God Himself. The phrase "no god but G o d " , in turn, cannot stand without its complement, "Muhammad is God's Prophet": God's unity can be properly known only by way of the Prophet's revelation, while the very notion of prophethood presupposes the idea of God. A like conjunction of opposites determines the very source of ultimate knowlege itself—the relation between the individual

436
person who wishes to know and the authoritative teacher whom he must discover. The reasoning of the individual, if he pursues it rigor ously, leads him to the dilemma presented in the third proposition: not only can the reason not discover ultimate truth for itself, it cannot even determine what authority to turn to. On the other hand, the claimant to ultimate authority, the imam, cannot substantiate his claims by recourse to any proof beyond himself, or he ceases to claim ultimate authority. But put the individual's reasoning and the authori tative teacher, the imam, together, and each solves the other's dilemma. What the individual's reasoning does is show him, not the imam, but his need for the imam and for his teaching, his ta'llm. It is only when reasoning has reached this point that the imam can present him self as fulfilling this very need. That imam, then, is true who does not allege extraneous proofs for his imamate but only his own exist ence as fulfilling the need which, and only which, reasoning can demonstrate. This imam, said Hasan, is the imam of the Isma'llls.1 Such an argument presupposes that there is a truth which is absolute and ultimate and yet unconditionally rational—a common enough assumption, in pre-modern times at least, which only Sufis were success fully challenging in Hasan's day. Given this intellectual atmosphere, the argument was hard to refute directly. Moreover, as compared with the general Shf I notion of .ta'lim, the more refined doctrine of ta'llm which Hasan presented was not only more rigorous logically but more self-sufficient. It did not deduce the position of the imam from the position of the Prophet, but rather deduced the prophethood of Muhammad from the office of the imam, whose authoritative teaching provided the only ultimate demonstration of the validity of prophethood. Thus the Isma'lli doctrine was supported on its own terms in dependently of any doctrine accepted by the Sunni community at large. The rigor and self-sufficiency of the doctrine were appropriate to the new sternness required of a movement in active and universal revolt. In effect, it laid its emphasis upon the movement itself, rather than on any ulterior reality or purpose to which the movement was the means. The imam was self-sufficient and the movement to establish his authority was self-contained, not to be justified by any given practical consequences. The critics complained that, in effect, this authoritative teacher taught nothing but his own authority. For men in the stress

THE NEW DOCTRINE
of an all-encompasing rebellion, it was precisely loyalty to the move ment—expressed as loyalty to the imam as its head—that mattered; once they were committed to the revolt, there was no leisure to con sider questions which might divide or at least confuse them. Presum ably, indeed, older and less urgent Isma'Ili doctrines continued to be taught, but Hasan's doctrine of ta'llm could well help to unite and discipline the movement in its immediate urgency.
The schism
In the midst of the risings, the Isma'Ili movement suffered an internal schism which tested the vitality of its doctrine. In 487/1094 died alMustansir of Egypt. The Fatimid state was now in the hands of alAfdal, son of Badr al-Jamali, as vizier. Badr had married al-Afdal's sister to a younger son of al-Mustansir, whom al-Afdal now raised to the caliphate as al-Mustacli. But it was an older son, Nizar, who had been known to have been designated by al-Mustansir as future imam. Nizar revolted with the support of an anti-Afdal military faction and of the Isma'IlI qddi of Alexandria, and was put down only the next year. Within Egypt and in the Yemen, the majority of Isma'llls went along with al-Afdal and accepted al-Musta'H as the true imam; but in Syria the Isma'llls were sharply divided, and in the rest of the Saljuq-ruled lands they insisted on the rights of Nizar, which they continued to recognize even when he was finally executed. The Iranian Isma'Uis did not, however, attempt then to interfere actively in Egypt, nor did they even identify any one of the descendants of Nizar as claimant to power in Egypt.
For the Egyptian state it was an advantage to retain power in the vizierial family by recognizing their creature, al-MustacH. Al-Afdal continued the cautious and firm policies of his father. But what was advantageous to the conservative Egyptian state would have been at most an encumbrance to the rebels against the Saljuqs, to whom the state gave no effective support. For the Iranians, it may well have been with relief that they found themselves no longer tied to the Fatimid power, free to pursue their own policies without the danger of in appropriate intervention from Cairo. The justification of the schism, however, was quite legitimately doctrinal. The basis on which the Isma'llls, at least retrospectively, had justified their adherence to Isma'ill and his son (as against Musa, whom
437



THE ISMÀ'ÌLÌ STATE
the Twelvers followed) was that Ja'far al-Sadiqhad explicitly designated Isma'il as the next imam, and that a subsequent designation of another son—supposing it had occurred—could not validly supersede the first designation. Al-Afdal claimed that al-Mustansir had designated alMusta'li on his deathbed, but it was understandable that pious Isma'ilis should hold by the earlier designation of Nizar. Nevertheless, onNizar's death a difficulty arose. Nizar seems to have designated no one of his sons as his successor; at any rate, no Nizarid rose to claim the imamate. Who then was the imam of the rebel Isma'ilis (who now called themselves Nizaris)?1 Before long, many outsiders and probably some Nizari Isma'ilis believed that a son or grandson of Nizar had been smuggled out of Egypt and was kept secretly at Alamut. But we have no evidence that this was done, and some evidence that it was not: later, the Egyptian government could claim to know that all the male descendants of Nizar were quiescent; the notion of a descendant of Nizar being at Alamut had to take the form of his having been a posthumous son by a slave girl, and hence unknown in Cairo. A t any rate, at Alamut no account seems to have been taken of the presence of any Nizarid. If we may judge by bits and shreds of evidence in later Isma'ili works, no imam at all was named, after Nizar. It was known that one of the Nizarids must be he, but not which one. Eventually, it seems, Hasan-i Sabbah, as the most important of the da'Is, was recognized as hujja, "proof", of the imam. The term hujja had already been used, at least informally, of a figure in the ideal spiritual hierarchy ranking next after the imam; now its use seems to have become more precise: Hasan was custodian of the Isma'ili mission until the imam should reappear, at which time he would point out the imam to the faithful. When this interpretation was adopted we cannot tell, but there is nothing against its having been adopted already in Hasan's lifetime; perhaps it was accepted at the same time as his leadership of the whole movement. We have still less way of knowing how Hasan himself felt about the doctrine, which presumably had not been taught him by any actual imam though it concerned the most ultimate truths, which should come by ta'llm. Yet the imam had been inaccessible to the faithful before, in the days before the rise of the Fatimids, and Hasan might

THE SCHISM
well feel himself divinely singled out, with his logical gifts, for bearing a burden now which someone had borne before. For the faithful generally, the expectation of the near-coming of a promised imam, whose mere humanity meanwhile was veiled by absence, might be more inspiring than a present and all-too-human ruler who in fact contributed nothing positive to the cause anyway. In Hasan's doctrine, the role of the imam had become so abstract as to amount to little more than a guarantee of the validity of the Isma'Ili movement as such. In the atmosphere of total dedication and imminent expectations which must have surrounded the Isma'ili risings, such a role could be played perhaps as well by an abstract postulate as by a distant and irrelevant monarch.
Methods of struggle
The revolt was unprecedented in form. The very leadership of the risings in their first years seems to have been as decentralized as the sites of their activity. After 'Abd al-Malik-i 'Attash's death, there is no assurance that the da'i of Isfahan had even a nominal precedence over an important dacI like that of Dailam. But the da'Is did co-operate, and the revolt soon showed a characteristic overall pattern precisely in its co-ordinated decentralization. Many movements which aimed at reforming Muslim society had taken as their model Muhammad's emigration to Medina, accordingly, they set up a ddr al-hijray a place of emigration, as headquarters for their campaign, from which to return victoriously into Muslim society at large as Muhammad had returned to Mecca. For the early Kharijis this had been a military camp to which all the truly faithful ought to move, and which commonly was shifted freely about the countryside as a base for something like guerilla warfare. For the Shi'is it had usually been a fixed base, where a strong army could be recruited and from which the other provinces could be conquered in regular military operations, as had happened in the rise of the 'Abbasids and of the Fatimids. For the rebel Isma'llls now there were many dar al-hijras, as many as there were local groups who could seize a stronghold for themselves and hold out against the established rulers. But all these dar al-hijras formed one community, and if one of them was lost, its people could find refuge in another. A t almost every town there was an Isma'ill cell. Such cells seem to have become the nucleus for armed bands, which—like some other
439



THE ISMA'ILI STATE
44o
armed bands formed in the artisan population—could even be accepted as allies in the fighting by one Saljuq faction against another. It was such armed bands that seized key fortresses as defensible headquarters —or occasionally were granted them by an amir who was glad to use their support. Such fortresses were garrisoned in a fairly conventional way: in each case, the troops were likely to owe allegiance first to their immediate commander, and only through him to the Saljuq regime or some faction in it. Hence it was not always immediately clear whether a given fortress was in Isma'ill hands or merely in the hands of a com mander willing to use Isma'ili manpower. When necessary, an Isma'ili garrison could maintain its position by offering submission to some Saljuq amir—which merely meant that it would send him part of any taxes raised on the surrounding lands and send forces to join in his battles. In the towns themselves, naturally, the ambiguity was even greater. Since the Isma'llis kept their allegiance secret, only the fulltime leaders were likely to be identified with any certainty by public rumour. As the Sunni public came to recognize the revolt as a serious threat, the Isma'ilis still in the towns began to look like a secret fifth column within the gates. The decentralized pattern of the revolt was appropriate to the times. There was no longer, after Malik-Shah's death, a single all-powerful Saljuq ruler to be replaced. But even before his death, with the decay of a centralized bureaucracy, the Islamic lands had come to be increasingly parcelled out in the hands of individual commanders of garrisons; to subdue the Saljuq domains meant subduing them all piecemeal. Even on the civilian side, the social structure put power in the hands of in dividuals of local standing, qadls or prominent 'ulamd—individuals whose power often resulted less from any special office dependent on a central authority than from relatively informal ties of local prestige and private patronage. There scarcely existed any single target for a military conquest by a regularly organized army, conquest which would have resulted in the submission of an obedient realm as had happened in Egypt. If the Isma'ilis were to win, it was reasonable to expect that, at least at first, it would be locality by locality, fort by fort. The same atomization of power suggested the use of an important auxiliary technique for achieving military and political aims: assassina tion. Where local authority was relatively personal, so that an official furnished with basically the same means of power as another official did not automatically succeed him, the elimination of a key individual



METHODS OF STRUGGLE
441
could disrupt any social undertaking. Thus the death of Malik-Shah automatically terminated the expedition against Kuhistan; it was thought of, not as a project of the state, but as the personal command of Malik-Shah himself, and the new ruler would have to launch it all over again if he cared to. In these circumstances, assassination was quite commonly resorted to by all factions. A t first, doubtless, the Isma'ilis resorted to it as an occasional convenience, as did anyone else. But before long they made a relatively systematic use of it. It is clear that they did not rely solely on assassi nation or the threat of it, nor did they always bring it into play even in the case of notorious enemies. But they used it sufficiently often so that almost any assassination was likely to be ascribed to them, and many prominent Sunni figures took precautions against it—even to wearing armour beneath their regular clothes. The Isma'ilis seem to have thought of it as a specially meritorious service in the war for the holy cause; those ready to accomplish missions of assassination were called fidats, devotees, and received special honour. (And if they were killed in action they would be rewarded as martyrs in Paradise, of course, according to the general Muslim doctrine.) Perhaps it was felt that it was better to kill one great man who caused trouble than to slaughter many ordinary men on a battlefield—a viewpoint presumably more acceptable to the Isma'ilis, who looked on the Sunni leaders as traitors to Islam, than to the Sunnis, who thought that the death of a great man, on whom the social order depended, was more disastrous than the death of many peasants. Certainly the risky action of killing a great man, who was normally surrounded by armed servants, was glorified as heroic. The Isma'ilis preferred to do it in as public a setting as possible, since part of the purpose was to intimidate any others who took too strong a position against them. Many of the murders were consequently highly dramatic; and the assassins did not often escape with their lives.
The Isma'ilis' readiness to use assassination went so far, it seems, that already in the days of the revolt they were willing to use it not only for their own immediate purposes but also in aid of non-Isma'ili political allies. Much later the Isma'ili chiefs were willing to hire out assassins to relatively friendly rulers for pay, but in the time of the revolt, even if an assassination were on behalf of a friend, it was clearly undertaken with an eye to the strategic advantage to the Isma'ilis of that friend's career; no clear line could be drawn between the several



THE I S M A I L ! STATE
442
purposes for which assassination might be used. It is doubtful if the assassinations were specially ritualized at that period, or that the assassins formed a special corps, as later they probably did; all Isma'llls called one another "comrades", and presumably all were in principle ready to perform any needful act in the common struggle. But doubtless some men held themselves in special readiness and were likely to be called on. It seems that at some point the practice arose of sending Isma'llis to insinuate themselves into the households of various great men as servants, who would be in a position to kill such men if they made themselves troublesome. A dramatic warning could be given—a knife by the sleeping man's cushion, with a note attached—so that the man would realize his peril without being able to identify the responsible member of the household, and be persuaded, by way of precaution, to curb his hostility to the Isma'llls.1 It is not clear how often such means were used, but one or two cases would be sufficient to stimulate a general fear of such secret Isma'IlI agents; no one knew whether he was one of those selected for secret surveillance. That fear would be quite as effective in many cases as the actual presence of an Isma'IlI in a given household. Nevertheless, normally assassination was carried out not by members of the household but by men specially sent to perform it, who stalked their victim till an appropriate occasion offered—as at a mosque or in a bath.
The assassinations were balanced almost from the beginning by massacres. The assassination of a popular leader or preacher who had initiated or incited action against the Isma'lHs could rouse the Sunni population of a town to round up all those in town who were suspected of being Isma'llls and then kill them summarily. Those who took the lead in such a massacre became themselves, in turn, the targets of assassination attempts. Massacres and assassinations appear together, frequent in some periods and areas, infrequent in others; rarely was one phenomenon unaccompanied by the other. The massacres were spurred by tales of Isma'Ili atrocities—Isma'llis were accused of bearing an indiscriminate hostility against mankind, or at least against all Muslims, and no sadistic practice seemed too improbable to be ascribed to them. About 486/1093 Isfahan was outraged by the report that a certain couple had been luring passing young men into an obscure alley (a blind man would ask a young man to guide him home there) and
1 Such a ruse was employed, according to Juvaini (transl. Boyle, pp. 681-2), by Hasan-i Sabbah himself in order to intimidate Sultan San jar.



METHODS OF STRUGGLE
putting them to death in their house in exquisite and gradual tortures; the couple were identified as Isma'ili, and they and all others accused of the same allegiance were dragged to a large bonfire and burned alive. As in all such cases of mass fright, many besides Isma'ilis fell victim to the massacres: anyone could get rid of an enemy by making a plausible accusation.1 Between assassinations and massacres, popular feeling hardened against the Isma'ilis. They were called by many names, notably Bdtiniyya (men of the bdtin, the inner meaning of texts); Alaldhida (heretics par excellence); and in Syria Hashlshiyja (smokers of hashish, narcotic hemp). The latter name was sufficiently current locally to be picked up by the Crusaders, under the form "Assassin" (from Hashdshln); it became the normal Occidental designation of the Nizari Isma'ilis and was ultimately used, as a common noun, for anyone who committed what readers of Crusading history associated most with them: public murders. The name also became the basis for several modern misunderstandings. It has been supposed, for instance, that the fida'is sent on assassination missions were drugged with hashishwhich would have been singularly inappropriate to the patient waiting and perfect timing which the assassinations required. It has also been supposed, on the basis of a modern reinterpretation of Muslim legends, that hashish was used to give the fida'is dreams of Paradise, convincing them to kill the more readily so as to go to Paradise as their reward; but for this there is no more real evidence than for the other. The name seems to have been used simply as an ugly sobriquet, perhaps on the basis of some now-forgotten local incident. In any case, it represented the popular feeling, which combined contempt and hatred with a bewildered astonishment at the Isma'ilis' mad courage.2
The Saljuq counteroffensive
At the start of the revolt is was still possible to evaluate the Isma'ilis in differing ways. It seems that several, but not all, captains on BerkYaruq's side looked on the Isma'ili bands as little more than another faction among the subject population, to be co-operated with when convenient, as would be done with local bands of Sunnis. Berk-Yaruq's

brothers and enemies, Muhammad and Sanjar, gained prestige among the more consciously Sunni by refusing any dealing with the Isma'llls. But whatever the am|rs' attitude, none of them on either side had leisure to campaign against the Isma'llls, except sporadically as the occasion arose in the course of other activities. From the time of the schism with Egypt till the death of Berk-Yaruq (49 8 /1104), the Isma'IlI fortunes seemed to be steadily on the rise. About 492/1099 the rats MuzafFar, a secret Isma'IlI well connected among the Saljuq officers at Isfahan, persuaded one of Berk-Yaruq's amirs to acquire Gird-Kuh, a strong fortress in the Alburz near Damghan in Qumis, and to install him there as his lieutenant. Gird-Kuh was along the main route between western Iran and Khurasan—part of the famous route between the Fertile Crescent and the Mediterranean to the west and the Tarim Basin and China to the east. As Hasan had done at Alamut, the ra'Is MuzafFar strengthened and stocked up the fortress as for an indefinite siege. A troop of Isma'llls from Kuhistan intervened on Berk-Yaruq's side shortly after, in 493/1100, in a battle near there between the ra'Is's patron and Sanjar, but they were unable to save the day for Berk-Yaruq; and the ra'Is's patron was killed in the fighting. The ra'Is nevertheless carried his patron's treasure to Gird-Kuh and held that stronghold, some time afterward openly declaring himself an Isma'Ili. But even closer to the middle of things, at least politically, was the seizure of the fortress Shahdiz not far from Isfahan. Ahmad-i 'Attash, the son of 'Abd al-Malik, set up as schoolmaster at the garrison, which was composed of presumably Shi'i Dailamis, and won them over; by about 494/1100 he was master of the place, and soon the Isma'ilis were able to collect taxes in the nearby lands to the detriment of the Saljuq treasury. The Isma'llls seized a second fortress in the vicinity, Khalinjan, about the same time. Ahmad's father is said to have retired to Alamut under Hasan's protection at about this time, as a result of rising hostility in Isfahan; but the report seems questionable. In any case, he was no longer active by now. Ahmad had the reputation of being a learned man, though not so much so as his father; the Sunni reports speak of him as if he were his father's successor as da'l at Isfahan and probably as head of the whole Nizarl movement. By this time, the association of some of Berk-Yaruq's captains with the Isma'ilis was proving disastrous. While the opposing Saljuq forces accused all Berk-Yaruq's men of Isma'ilism, and Berk-Yaruq



THE SALJUQ COUNTEROFFENSIVE
was held responsible for Isma'ili attacks on amirs who opposed him, he was himself attempted by assassins when he appointed a vizier who was strongly anti-Isma'ili. In 494/1101, Berk-Yaruq in western Iran and Sanjar in Khurasan came to an agreement to regard the Isma'ilis no longer as local bands but as a general threat to Saljuq power, and to act against them. The chief fruit of Berk-Yaruq's resolve was a grand massacre of suspected Isma'ilis at Isfahan, Baghdad, and elsewhere. Army officers were especially affected and several of them fled. Sanjar, with fewer friends of the Isma'ilis to purge within his own ranks, sent instead an expedition against Tabas in Kuhistan, which was said to have been bought off after causing much devastation; and three years later he sent another which wrecked Tabas and de stroyed as much else as possible. The second expedition, as a jihad (holy war), was joined by many Sunni volunteers in addition to the regular troops, and the Isma'ili captives, as apostates, were enslaved. Yet the next year Isma'ilis from Turshiz in Kuhistan were in a position to raid a Sunni caravan as far west as Ray; and in Berk-Yaruq's lands no Isma'ili fortresses seem to have been overthrown at all.
Meanwhile, the Isma'ili position was being consolidated in Rudbar, where several other fortresses were aligned with Alamut, apparently in many cases by agreement with the local leaders, who received aid from the Isma'ilis against domination from Ray and Qazvin. The most important addition was Lanbasar, considerably west of Alamut in the Shahrud valley. After its garrison went back on their first agree ment with the Isma'ilis, it was re-subjugated by Hasan's lieutenant Buzurg-Ummid and built into a major stronghold. In Syria in this period the Isma'ilis controlled as yet no fortresses, but they were strong in Aleppo and in the nearby towns of the Jazr region, and they enjoyed the patronage of Ridwan, Saljuq amir of Aleppo. With the advent to power of Muhammad Tapar, however, the more important dynastic disputes ended and the Saljuq forces made greater headway against the Isma'ili revolt. Even in Syria, Ridwan turned gradually against the Isma'ilis, who had become embarrassing, and he allowed more than one massacre of them; on his death in 507/1113, they were scattered from their headquarters in Aleppo and for some time sought vainly a citadel which they could hold for their own. Most of the Isma'ili strongholds in the Zagros mountains seem to have fallen during Muhammad's reign. In 500/1107 Muhammad sent an expedition against Takrit; to avoid letting it fail into his hands, its

master turned it over to an Arab chief, Sadaqa, who was a ShI'I but no Isma'ili. The most important project, led by Muhammad in person, was to rid the neighbourhood of Isfahan of its Isma'llls. Ahmad-i 'Attash negotiated long and, for a time, successfully to maintain himself in Shahdiz, arguing that he was a Muslim and should be accepted as a legitimate garrison chief so long as he submitted to Muhammad's overall direction—that is, above all, paid him tribute and served in his wars. There were those in Isfahan who were willing to let him serve if in future he would indeed be obedient to the Saljuq ruler. But the more zealous Sunni 'ulama turned the day by arguing that the Isma'llls were not in fact true Muslims; that by exalting the batin, the supposed inner meaning of the law7, they had abandoned Islam even though they still observed the law, as they did. In this case no accommodation could be made with them. Finally a capitulation was agreed to in 500/1107 in which many of the Isma'llls were allowed safe-conduct to more distant Isma'IlI fortresses while the nucleus of the garrison was to surrender outright when the others had got away. In the end the nucleus resisted nonetheless, fighting even for the last turrets. Ahmad was finally cap tured, paraded ignominiously through the town, and skinned alive. Sanjar was encouraged to send a further expedition against the Isma'llls of Kuhistan. But we hear more of the expedition against Alamut. After the fall of Shahdiz and the death of the da'l of Isfahan, if not even earlier (as some reports seem to suggest, at least in some Isma'IlI circles), Hasan-i Sabbah presumably was acknowledged as head of the whole Nizarl Isma'IlI movement, and Alamut as its headquarters. After a futile expedition by the vizier himself, a son of Nizam al-Mulk, the reduction of Alamut was entrusted to Shirgir, the amir of Saveh. He tried attrition, taking some places fairly near Qazvin, but above all Rudbar in a yearly expedition for seven years. At length, in 511/1118, he was ready for a full-scale siege. Other amirs were sent to help him. But as the surrender of Alamut seemed to draw near, the news of Malik-Shah's death arrived and the army broke up despite Shirgir's pleas. Alamut was saved.1

THE TERRITORIAL POSITION
II. S T A L E M A T E
Though Alamüt was safe, the revolt as such was over. In the almost thirty years since Alamüt had been seized, the Ismá'ilís had done their best to establish themselves throughout the Saljuq domains; they had posed a serious threat to Saljuq rule for a time, with considerable strength in and around Isfahan itself. But their partisans in the cities had been massacred or disorganized, and many of their strongholds had been destroyed. What remained could not seriously serve as a base for general revolt, at least not till their party had been widely rebuilt and a new effort prepared. The imam had never appeared in power to save the situation, and the times did not seem propitious for him to do so now. T o be sure, the rebellion had been successful on a local basis in Rüdbár and Kühistán, where whole districts had asserted and main tained their independence of the Saljuqs. But with the failure of the overall effort, one might have expected the surviving Isma'ilis to break up into local groupings and to be assimilated into the evolving Sunni social and political structure on a local ad hoc basis. Y e t the Ismá'ílis held together from Kühistán to Syria. The sons of the rebels were still dedicated. A further generation with essentially the same puritan and power-oriented outlook had to pass before a new beginning would be attempted. Meanwhile the Isma'ilis carried on the old struggle as best they could.
Definition of the territorialposition
Though there was no major succession dispute on Muhammad Tapar's death, his successor at Isfahan, Mahmüd, and Sanjar, as general head of the Saljuqs, were sufficiently occupied with other troubles not to press much further against the Ismá'ilís. Sanjar is said to have made a truce with the Isma'ilis, persuaded by a dagger which Hasan con trived to have thrust into the floor next to Sanjar's pillow. The his torian Juvaini found conciliatory letters from Sanjar in the Isma'ili archives. The Isma'ilis at Alamüt reoccupied fortresses which they had given up to Shirgir. During the rest of his life (to 518/1124) Hasan-i Sabbáh, while remaining da'i of Dailam, seems to have been regarded as head of the community. He presumably devoted himself to consolidating its position in the territories it had won, and perhaps also to reaffirming, in some degree, a central authority over them. These territories consisted primarily of two main districts: Rüdbár

and a large part of Kuhistan. Rudbar was felt to be the core portion of Dailam and inherited the militant and particularist temper of the Dailami mountaineers. There were dozens of fortresses in its moun tains, not only in the Alburz proper north of the Shahrud but in the lower mountains between that valley and Qazvin; the Isma'ills some times held a fortress or so sufficiently near Qazvin to serve as a special irritant to the Qazvinis. The chief of the Rudbar Isma'Ilis, who was also head of the whole community, commonly resided at Alamut, but by no means always. The most immediate neighbours and enemies of Rudbar were Qazvin to the south and Ruyan to the north (between the Alburz and the sea); accordingly, the rulers of 'Iraq-i 'Ajam at Isfahan and of Mazandaran at Amul, the respective suzerains of those two neighbours, intermittently felt it their duty to destroy the Isma'IlI power, which lay between their territories. The Isma'IlI territory in Kuhistan was distinctly more extensive, including several towns more substantial than any in Rudbar. In the north, Turshiz was readily involved in hostilities with the authorities in Khurasan, while Nih in the south was commonly at odds with Sistan. The KuhistanI Isma'ilis owned the authority of a single chief, appointed at Alamut, who resided usually, but not always, in either Tun or Qa'in or in the fortress of Mu'minabad.
In addition to the two main territories, the Isma'IlI state included three other scattered tracts. The other fortresses in the eastern Alburz seem to have been lost, but Gird-Kuh at Damghan was held and stood isolated but firm as an Isma'ili outpost. Though the fortresses in the southern Zagros had been lost, farther north in the Zagros, in Luristan, some fortresses were retained or else soon after acquired, with the support of some local Jewish clans. Lastly, after Hasan's death, the Isma'Ilis in Syria finally acquired their long-sought independent base in the mountains west of Hama and Hims, where they acquired a small group of fortified towns; here they were ruled by an appointee of Alamut, who sometimes resided at Masyaf. For a time, even after Hasan's death, the Isma'IlI community in cluded not only those in the independent territories but a substantial number in at least some Iranian cities. Correspondingly, not everyone in Rudbar or (probably) in Isma'IlI Kuhistan was an Isma'ili. But gradually we cease to hear of Isma'Ilis outside of their own territories, except in the Jazr district of Syria, east of Aleppo, and possibly in parts of Kuhistan and Sistan that were not ruled by Isma'ilis. Doubtless



THE TERRITORIAL POSITION
some such Isma'ilis persisted, though without playing a large role in the Isma'ili state, or presumably, in the fortunes of the religious com munity. A t some time, but we do not know whether in the Alamut period, the numerous Isma'ilis of the upper Oxus basin were won over to the Nizari position. But in large measure the state formed henceforth an independent Isma'ili society with little stake in the wider Sunni society except so far as its often active trade and, indeed, its continuing intellectual interests, enforced interaction.1
The continuing struggle
On Hasan-i Sabbah's death in 518/1124, his position as da'i of Dailam and as head of the community fell to his lieutenant at Lanbasar, Buzurg-Ummid. This man was well connected, at least by marriage, with ruling families in the Caspian region, but clearly he was chosen also for his personal qualities. He moved to Alamut and carried on the rigorous policies of his predecessor, aided by a council of three advisers who had also been appointed by Hasan. One gets the impression that the Isma'ilis' enemies hoped he would prove a lesser man than Hasan; within two years of his accession, the Saljuqs were attacking both Rudbar and Kuhistan. A t Amid there was a massacre of suspected Isma'ilis. But the attacks seem to have had no success. On the contrary, in the first years of Buzurg-Ummid's rule, the Isma'ili position in Rudbar was strengthened. The fortress of Taliqan was taken, then or earlier—this was presumably the strongest place in the Taliqan mountains; and a new fortress, Maimun-Diz, was built at the border of the Isma'ili territory downstream from Alamut.2 Meanwhile, the Isma'ilis were becoming embroiled on a more local basis. The Bavandid rulers of Mazandaran, who had refused to join Muhammad Tapar against Alamut, had become their active enemy by the time of Mahmud's campaign. Then the Isma'ilis' envoy to Mahmud at Isfahan had been lynched, and they avenged themselves, not on the Isfahanis, but on the more accessible Qazvinis, thus exacerbating an enmity with that city which persisted even when the ruler of 'Iraq-i 'Ajam was inactive. A t least some of the Kuhistani Isma'ilis were at war with the amirs of Sistan with little regard to what arrangements

Sanjar might make. The greatest triumph o f Buzurg-Ummid's reign seems to have been the defeat and execution by fire of a Zaidi imam, A b u Hashim, who had arisen to power in the non-lsma'lll districts of Dailam.1 When Buzurg-Ummid died in 532/1138, his son Muhammad became da'I, and, like him, held the allegiance of all the several Isma'ili territories. In the earlier part of his reign, at least, he increased the area under the control of Alamut, seizing some fortresses in the direction of Gilan. But the quarrels with the Isma'Ilis' neighbours sometimes seemed little more exalted than personal feuds. A n amir of Ray campaigned against them in Rudbar after his master's assassina tion, perhaps even despite Sanjar's orders; he built a t o w e r of Isma'ili heads. The ruler of Turshiz tried at one point to restore Sunnism there, w a s expelled, and failed to regain his position even w i t h an army from Sanjar. For at least six years after 545/1150, one of Sanjar's amirs, Ibn Anaz, carried on an almost personal series of raids in Kuhistan. Perhaps the most disastrous such vendetta for the Isma'Ilis was the hostility of Shah Ghazi of Mazandaran, who built several towers o f Isma'ili heads gathered from his Rudbar campaigns, though even he does not seem to have made permanent conquests o f land. The raids and counter-raids exchanged with Qazvln persisted throughout; the Isma'Ilis' chroniclerhas recorded the number of sheep taken o n each raid.2 Though the Nizarls had made n o serious attempt to support the Nizarid cause in Egypt after the schism, bitterness yet remained between the two parties, especially in Syria. Under al-Musta'li's son al-Amir (personal rule, 515/1121-524/1130), beginning with what was held to be a Nizarl assassination o f the vizier al-Afdal, the Nizarl cause seems to have been especially active even in Egypt. The succeeding vizier took extensive measures to guard against a new assassination, allegedly even trying to keep track o f any who might be setting out from Alamut, and at any rate blaming directly o n Alamut the activity o f Nizarl agents uncovered. A public defence o f al-Amir's rights as imam, as against those o f his uncle Nizar, was deemed necessary. But in 524/1130 al-Amir was assassinated (again, but more clearly, by Nizarls); thereupon the Egyptian Isma'Ilis themselves split. He seems to have had a son in that last year, al-Tayyib; but whether because the infant died or because he otherwise disappeared, o n al-Amir's

THE CONTINUING STRUGGLE
death there seemed to be no male heir. After a time of confusion, al-Amir's cousin (by another uncle) took power as al-Hafiz and claimed the imamate. The main body of Egyptian Isma'ilis accepted him, being called Hafiziyya; the Isma'ilis of the Yemen, the chief body of non-Nizari Isma'ilis outside Egypt, rejected him in the name of al-Tayyib, and they became the Tayyibis. Henceforth, though the Nizaris and Hafizis seem to have had occasional hostile and even friendly relations, the Nizaris seem to have taken no further account of the Fatimid caliphate.1 After a spate of assassinations and massacres at the beginning of Muhammad's reign—these were now limited pretty much to the relatively northerly lands from Kuhistan to Syria, without the involve ment of such cities as Baghdad—traces of Isma'ili activity in cities away from the Isma'ili-ruled territories become few. It is said that under Jahan-Suz Ghuri (d. 556/1161) Isma'ili propagandists were invited into Ghur, where his successor had to kill them along with their converts. But even if this is not a case of maliciously mistaken identity, it is not typical of the Isma'ili activity of the time. Nevertheless, the Isma'ilis continued to maintain a large sense of their mission. The chroniclers of Buzurg-Ummid and his son stressed their acts of generosity—as in the case of a militant enemy amir whose fortunes at home had changed and who sought refuge with the Isma'ilis and was not yielded up to his enemies despite their reminder that previously he had acted treacherously against the Isma'ilis. The Isma'ilis gloried especially in two acts that seemed to take them on to the world stage again for a moment: the assassinations of the 'Abbasid caliphs al-Mustarshid and then of his son, al-Rashid. Neither caliph was master any longer of a caliphal empire: indeed, both were out of favour with their Saljuq masters, and were either in prison or in exile. Yet the Isma'ilis gave their assassins the accolade of al-cAbbasi, victors over the house of 'Abbas, and they even interpreted the necessary exile of al-Rashid as an expedition by the lord of all Sunnis against the Isma'ilis to avenge his father.
Reactions among the Sunnis
By the end of Muhammad b. Buzurg-Ummid's reign, the picture of a great life-and-death struggle with the 'Abbasid caliphate was as inappropriate to the Isma'ili state as it was to the 'Abbasid. Y e t the

Isma'ili sense of their own grandeur was answered by the Sunnis' corresponding feeling that they still constituted a major threat to Sunni Muslim society. The impact of the Isma'ili revolt had been farreaching and was only then losing its immediacy. Zealous Sunnis were still inclined to see the Isma'llis as the arch-enemies of Islam. The first results of the revolt had been, of course, highly disruptivenot only by way of direct Isma'ili action but also by way of the Sunnis' panic in response to it, which launched indiscriminate massacres. But apart from immediate political and social consequences, the movement had significant intellectual and imaginative consequences among the Sunnis which were more enduring. The first question that was raised was what limits should be put to the Sunni doctrine that membership of the Muslim community should be determined by external actsnotably by acknowledgement of Muhammad and performance of the saldt in the direction of Mecca—while hearts could be judged by G o d alone. A t Isfahan those who insisted that the privileges of being a Muslim should be less freely granted had their way when the Isma'llis were excluded despite their external conformity; many later Muslims followed this precedent. This problem as presented in the Isma'ills was also a major one for Ghazali, who wrote an incisive treatise to resolve it; he then cited that treatise in many other connexions, as fundamental to deciding what sort of intellectual position was and was not com patible with Islam. But Ghazali was touched by the Isma'111 position, and especially by Hasan's doctrine of ta'lim, more deeply than this. He wrote many works designed to refute the Isma'ills, some of which seem equally designed to settle his own conscience with regard to their challenge. In the Munqidh min al-dalldl he came to terms with four categories of seekers of the truth, as representative of all the intellectual positions worthy of serious consideration: the philosophers of the Greek tradi tion; the mutakallimun^ taken en bloc as those who argue on behalf of historical revelation; the Sufis with their immediate mystical con sciousness—and the Isma'llis with their doctrine of ta'lim. T o each of the first three groups he allowed a carefully defined role in his total vision of truth-seeking; and though he condemned the Isma'llis roundly, it can be argued that, if not to them, at least to their position he likewise allowed a certain role. He claimed that Muhammad himself was the true authoritative teacher whose existence, as the Isma'llis showed, reason posited and might verify, but whose teaching it could



REACTIONS AMONG THE SUNNIS
not reach by itself. In doing so he not only undercut the Isma'ili doctrine but introduced a new approach into the Sunni doctrine itself: the historical revelation was to be kept central yet was to be tested and interpreted by the inner need of the human being—at its highest, of course, in Sufi experience. The Isma'ili logic helped make possible this integration of history with personal inwardness. No other Sunni was so intimately influenced by the Nizari Isma'ili doctrine as was Ghazali; but few other Sunni writers were so influen tial. Other Sunnis of the time wrestled with the questions raised, but less perceptively. Probably the last to whom the questions were intellectually actual was Shahrastani (d. 548/1153), who debated with Isma'ilis and was more irritated than challenged by them (though he may have used their writings incidentally in his history of doctrine). For later writers, the doctrine of ta'lim was something out of the past —Fakhr al-Din Razi used it to make a debating point against Ghazali, for instance. The stimulus to the Muslim imagination was more lasting and has carried over into the Occident. A t the time of the revolt itself, the popular reaction came to be an unthinking enraged terror, which created as its objects diabolically clever and ruthless leaders manipula ting gullibly stupid followers. The people of Rudbar were so stupid, it was said, that one of them would saw off the branch he sat on; while Hasan-i Sabbah was felt to have almost superhuman powers of insight, by which he could win the blind devotion of many skilled individuals and direct them successfully in the most widely ramified and delicate undertakings. The old explanation of Isma'ilism—that it was invented by a Persian Zoroastrian who resented the Arab victory and wanted to subvert Islam and replace it with dualism, to which doctrine Isma'il ism would lead—no longer sufficed; it was not dropped, but rather than Islamic doctrine, the Isma'ilis' target was now said to be the Muslims themselves: their whole purpose, some believed (as during the panic at Isfahan), was to kill as many Muslims as cruelly as possible. Soon this temper was crystallized into romantic legends. The idea that Hasan used drugs to make his human tools more manipulable appeared early in a crude form (walnuts, coriander, and honey to expand the brain). By the time of Marco Polo, the tale was current in Iran that Hasan had had a garden made to resemble Paradise, with beautiful maidens at the disposal of the young man who (drugged asleep so as to be transported there unawares) was told (when he awoke a second
45 3



THE ISMA'ILI STATE
454
time and the garden had vanished) that Hasan could send him to that Paradise at will, and would send him there permanently if he died in his service. In Arabic, too, the story turned up in a historical novel set in al-Hakim's time, in which the master of the garden was one Isma'il at Masyaf, a subsequent headquarters of the Syrian Nizaris. It was a Western scholar, Silvestre de Sacy, who later put together the nickname Hashishiyya and the notion of the drug, and surmised that the drug was no mere sleeping powder but a vision-engendering nar cotic, and that no real garden was necessary. But the garden was too fascinating a theme to be dispensed with, and modern popular lore has retained both the hashish and the garden. Other tales were told: at a nightly orgy, males and females would gather and mingle sexually at will with no regard to status or relation ship; then the next day, at a word from their master, Isma'ili fida'is would leap from a turret to their death, for the edification of a visitor. For ordinary Muslims—and for medieval Westerners, whose imagina tions proved quite as lurid—the Isma'ilis became a dreamworld em bodying whatever fascinating horror the sober actuality ruled out from their prosaic lives. But some of the tales seem to have originated with the Isma'ilis themselves, notably the tale of the three school fellows, which FitzGerald retold in his introduction to the Rubaiyyat. A s the Isma'ilis told it, Hasan-i Sabbah was the hero. Since the three students had agreed to share among themselves the good fortune that any of them should achieve, Hasan came, as did 'Umar Khayyam, to Nizam al-Mulk when he became vizier, expecting his favour. But when Hasan, duly established at court, proved much more capable than Nizam al-Mulk, the latter's condescension to his old friend gave way to jealousy, and he plotted to cover the unsuspecting Hasan with ignominy and have him disgraced. It was thus the vizier who began the hostility which Hasan brought to a conclusion by launching the revolt and getting the vizier assassinated in revenge. The efforts of Sunnl versions to whitewash the vizier were only partly successful, but the story was so appealing that it continued to circulate nonetheless. In the realm of the imagination, the Isma'ili inspiration, direct or indirect, ruled unchallenged even after their political power disap peared.1

THE C O N T I N U I N G VITALITY OF THE ISMACILIS
The continuing vitality of the Ismcfilis
Indeed, the Isma'ili imaginative power may have contributed to the un wonted vitality which the Isma'ili state continued to show even in its reduced form. That vitality is already exhibited in its very survival. In the Islamic society of that age, when so much in the political sphere depended on direct military power, the authority of a government did not normally extend beyond the range of its armies. The five parcels that went to make up the Isma'ili state could obviously not be controlled militarily from any one centre; its unity could in no way be enforced. Nor were the Isma'ilis of one area able to send much material assistance to another area; there was no immediate profit to be gained from the unity. Yet the state remained one; the governors of Kuhistan and of Syria were regularly appointed by the authority at Alamut until Alamut itself fell, despite drastic changes of policy which some of the rulers of Alamut were to institute. Surely it was a common vision as much as mutual service that kept those widely dispersed territories together for five generations. The vitality of the state is also attested by the stability of its dynasty. There seem to have been no succession disputes, either at first when it was a da'i who ruled, or later when the imamate was at stake. Twenty years is a relatively long reign in a Muslim dynasty where the effective power is vested in the ruler; but of the seven reigns at Alamut (the eighth was cut short by the Mongols), four are longer than that: twenty-four, thirty-four, thirty-four, and even forty-four years. T w o rulers were murdered (and just possibly a third); one of them after a peculiarly drastic change of policy, the other after his personality showed signs of deterioration—he was the only ruler of the seven who was not fully competent personally (and even he may have been blackened posthumously). The rulers were supported by a vigorous and independent community life in each of the Isma'ili districts, and though they could initiate extreme changes of policy they were not allowed to grow soft.1 Considering the small extent and limited economy of the state, it retained a disproportionate power: repeatedly the Isma'ilis were able to expand beyond their holdings, and their diplomacy often ranged far and effectively—at more than one period they were respectfully listened to as far away as in the courts of Western Europe. T o the

Sunnis, their power seemed greater than it really was: the continuing intense hatred for the Ismá'ílis, which finally led Sunnis to call the Mongols down on them when no Muslim power seemed capable of defeating them, bears witness to the Ismá'íli reputation. It has been suggested that this power was based on the weapon of assassination. Doubtless that played a role; but the Ismá'ílis were by no means the only ones who resorted to assassination, nor could such a weapon have been systematically effective over many generations unless it were backed up by strong institutions. The Ismá'íll society was not a typical mountaineer and small-town society, despite the counting of sheep after raids. Each community maintained its own sense of initiative in the framework of the wider cause, and probably a sense of larger strategy was never completely absent: the immediate consequence everywhere of changes in their overall external policy suggest this. But what was most distinctive was the high level of intellectual life. The prominent early Ismá'ílis were commonly known as scholars, often as astronomers, and at least some later Ismá'ílis continued the tradition. In Alamüt, in Kühistán, and in Syria, at the main centres at least, were libraries which included Qur'áns and religious literature of all sorts, but also scientific books and equipment; visitors were impressed with the libraries, which were well known among SunnI scholars. T o the end the Ismá'ílis prized sophisticated interpretations of their own doctrines, and were also interested in every kind of knowledge which the age could offer. The vitality of their community was reinforced by the continuing arrival of a certain number of outsiders into the Ismá'íll centres. We hear of few Ismá'ílis coming in from outside; after the time of BuzurgUmmid the Ismá'ílis of the diaspora would not have been sufficiently numerous to help much, either in supporting Ismá'ilí external policies or in revitalizing the isolated communities. Yet the Ismá'ílis did chal lenge the imagination and were able to attract individuals of high calibre. Some of these were political refugees—amirs who had lost out in quarrels within the SunnI world and who knew the Ismá'ílis would never give them up to their enemies. Some were adventurous youths who adopted Ismá'illsm, such as Ráshid ai-Din Sinán, who later became head of the Syrian Ismá'ílis; he seems to have been brought up in a Nusairi community in Iraq, and to have gone to Alamüt when he wanted to get away from home. Finally, in the later period, there were a number of outside scholars attracted to the Ismá'íll libraries



THE C O N T I N U I N G VITALITY OF T H E ISMA'ILIS
and to their generous patronage of learning; most of them seem to have remained frankly non-Isma'ili, but they helped maintain the high intellectual tone of the community. The greatest of them, Nasir al-Din Tusi, even wrote major Isma'ili treatises. Accordingly, we must attribute the Isma'ili strength only in part to their military methods or to the political genius of their early leaders, and to the irrationally persistent reputation which the later generations retained. In large part it resulted from the solidarity they could main tain among themselves under outside pressure; from their ability to renew a social and religious tradition which encouraged their continued independence; and from the special appeal they made, in the con temporary Muslim society, to the exceptional individual.
III. R E S U R R E C T I O N
Theological doctrines usually serve as a criticism and discipline of religious practice, warning of pitfalls to be avoided in terms of a given tradition. But sometimes they can form a positive charter for spiritual renewal, as was now to be the case. Doctrines cannot really describe such a renewal, but the nature of its spiritual life can be deduced from them. By the shifts they make in terminology and emphasis, and in parti cular by the points which prove crucial at moments of polemic with other viewpoints, they indicate what sorts of mood, insight, aspiration, and commitment are to be legitimized and given social encouragement. We know the next stage of the Isma'ili community life almost ex clusively through its theological production; from this we must try to deduce the life of the time. But such a procedure is not entirely inappropriate. Theological doctrines are especially important in a com munity like that of the Nizari Isma'ilis, which depended so much on a continual revitalizing of their distinctive group orientation.
Hasan II: sublimation of expectations
In the later years of Muhammad b. Buzurg-Ummid, there was a movement among the younger Isma'ilis to revive what had always been a popular doctrine in Isma'ili circles, though it had been sup pressed by the Isma'ili leadership: the doctrine that the shari'a ritual law no longer applied to those who understood the batin, the inner meaning of it, for the shari'a was simply a set of symbols intended to
457



THE ISMA'ILI STATE
incite to more understanding beyond itself, and when it had fulfilled its function it was no longer binding. Those who believed this had seen the imposition of shari'a on enlightened and devoted Isma'llls as a kind of taqiyya, or dissimulation designed only to help keep the ignorant, wilful Sunnis in place—lest they follow the free Isma'llls' example prematurely and, without even the symbols of truth to restrain them, give rein to their evil natures and cast aside all law and order altogether. In any case, at the end of the age, when the imam established full justice in the world—an eschatological time which many Isma'llls identified with the Last Judgment and the coming of Paradise—the shari'a would be abolished, for it would no longer be relevant when the imperfect conditions of the present life were past. But many Isma'llls were restive, at least in their private lives, at waiting for the grand con summation. During the active revolt the Isma'llI puritanism had been accentuated as all energies were focused on the immediate goal of material victory. But now it would seem that in their own districts, set apart from the SunnI world, the Isma'llls no longer had any re sponsibility to set a cautious example to the Sunnis. Why shouldn't the Isma'llls assume their rightful freedom from the petty restrictions of the shari'a and live in full recognition of the spiritual truths of their faith, which preoccupation with the shari'a ritual tended to obscure ? When Muhammad found that among the young men who inclined to this viewpoint was his own son Hasan, who was expected to succeed him as da'I, he took drastic action. It is said that Hasan drank wine in secret to show that he was above the law, and that some of the Isma'llls took this to be a sign that he was the true imam. Muhammad had 250 men killed and exiled 250 more, and Hasan denied publicly that he was the imam; apparently from that time till Muhammad's death Hasan curbed his tongue. But Hasan had read widely not only in the older books of the Isma'llls but also in philosophic and Sufi writings. He seems to have learned to interpret the old Isma'llI hopes in the light of Sufi psychological insights. He is said to have been very affable and popular in Rudbar, where he was regarded as more learned than his father; on his father's death (557/1162) he succeeded without dispute and proceeded to prepare the way, cautiously, for a reform. After two years he was ready.1 On 17 Ramadan 559/1164 he gathered together at Alamut repre sentatives from the various dispersed Isma'llI groups, at least those in

Iran (the Syrians are not mentioned, and the new dispensation may not have been fully introduced to them till later). He read them a message supposed to be from the imam, naming Hasan as the imam's special representative with plenary authority, entitling him not only da'I but also hujja, proof of the imam (like Hasan-i Sabbah), and finally caliph, representative of the imam, presumably a higher rank yet. A t last the imam was emerging. But he announced yet more: the longforetold Last Day had arrived—qiydmay the Resurrection—when all mankind would be judged and committed forever to either Hell or Paradise; henceforth those who refused to accept the imam were cast into Hell, which was spiritual non-existence, while those who accepted him were in Paradise. Finally, as was fitting in Paradise, taqiyya was no longer necessary and the sharfa was at an end. Accordingly, the fast of Ramadan (which in the batin had been held to stand for taqiyya) was broken with a feast then and there. Toward the time of the hajj pil grimage, a similar ceremony was held at the fortress Mu'minabad in Kuhistan, where Hasan's position as caliph was explicitly identified with that of the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir—who had in fact been imam.1 The great resurrection, the end of the world, was thus understood (in a typically Isma'lU manner) in a symbolic sense. It was the end of a religious era, and the beginning of a spiritual dispensation of moral, not physical, perfection. The end of earthly life, of the external level of reality, at least as possessing religious significance, and also the end of the sharfa law, was the moment when the inward meaning of reality became evident and what mattered henceforth would be a purely spiritual life of inward states of the soul. The event may be compared with the advent of the dispensation of grace and the end of the dis pensation of the law as Paul presented them. More properly, it must be interpreted in Sufi terms: the inner life of moral and mystical experience was the sole reality henceforth to be attended to. Those who could respond were, spiritually, already in eternal life, and those who could not were spiritually lifeless. This was the long-awaited culmination; the faithful Isma'llls who understood were to leave behind all material compromise and rise to the spiritual level which was the only true victory; that is, they were to become spiritually perfect; while the Sunnis were defeated in the most final sense possible, in that all their

further efforts were rendered spiritually meaningless. Thus was established the doctrine of the qiyama, the Resurrection, as the new basis of Isma'ili life. From one point of view, Hasan's proclamation was the natural fulfilment of Isma'ili hopes. But it raised serious difficulties, covered over for the time being by the enthusiasm of the reform and the personal popularity of Hasan himself. The dominant moral tone of Nizari Isma'ilism had been a rigorous moral purism founded on the shari'a as such; the doctrine of the qiyama made a radical reversal in this. The reversal was not merely permissive: Hasan seems to have insisted that the Isma'ilis must all live according to the new dispensation, in inward spiritual alertness and without the law, just as previously they all had to live according to the old legalistic dispensation. Some persons are said to have emigrated rather than comply. Then the doctrine of the qiyama itself presented difficulties: though Isma'ilis might be willing to find that the new heaven and the new earth were not geophysically new but only spiritually new, yet it had been supposed that the eschatological event would still produce a drastic transformation at least of all human society. The first moment was doubtless exhilarating; perfection often does seem within reach at the moment of revolution. But the Isma'ilis had yet to learn to live with the implications of the new doctrine.
Muhammad II: formulation of the doctrine
Hasan did not live to solve the problems. A year and a half after the declaration of the Resurrection, he was murdered by a brother-in-law, a partisan of the shari'a. However, his nineteen-year-old son Muhammad succeeded to his position, reaffirmed Hasan's policies, and devoted his life to elaborating the doctrine of the qiyama in numerous treatises. The doctrine of the qiyama effectively replaced the doctrine of ta'lim as central in the theory of the Nizari Isma'ilis. Each of these doctrines carried one aspect of older Isma'ili teaching to its extreme: as the doctrine of ta'lim exalted the lone .authority of the imam, so that of the qiyama exalted the lone validity of the batin. The doctrine of the qiyama was even more extreme than that of ta'lim and presented a contrasting temper, substituting high personal consciousness for group rigorism. It was surely facilitated by the legacy of radical Isma'ili ideas which had always been present among Isma'ilis (sometimes

transformed into folklore), and which might be expected to come to the fore in out-of-the-way areas when the discipline of city-bred scholars was relaxed. In the case of the Syrian Isma'ilis, at least, we have good evidence that such radical ideas, taking popular form, did prevail. Notions of reincarnation and even of transmigration, rejected by most official Isma'ili teachers, had long been associated with extreme em phasis on the batin, and now reappeared. But the Isma'ilis remained sufficiently sophisticated to require a scholarly defence even of popularly appealing ideas. The first theoretical problem lay in the person of the imam. A t the qiyama, the great Resurrection, the imam must be present in person: it was precisely the role of culminating imam (called the qd'ini) to usher in the qiyama, for which all his followers were waiting and to which the other imams were but as links in a chain. Indeed, if taqiyya was lifted, if the batin became evident and the inner secrets were revealed, the first of those was precisely the identity of the imam and his true position. Where then was the imam ? It would seem that before the end of his life Hasan II had hinted that he was himself not merely the caliph, representative of the imam, but the imam himself. But the imam ought to be a direct descendant of 'Ali and in particular of Nizar, which Buzurg-Ummid, Hasan's grandfather, certainly had not been. Probably Hasan maintained that he was imam in the batin, to which the external descent in the flesh would be indifferent. Muhammad II took the step of announcing that Hasan had been imam according to physical descent also; and thus Muhammad II likewise, being his son, was imam. The story which he seems to have sponsored was that Hasan was not the son of Muhammad b. Buzurg-Ummid but of a descendant of Nizar who had in fact been hidden in Alamut just as the outside tales had had it. Either the babies had been interchanged or the imam (not bound to the law) had actually slept with the da'i's wife. In any case, the Nizarid line of imams had appeared and was acting on its own authority in Alamut. If one believed that the qiyama was valid to begin with, some such conclusion followed almost necessarily in the ingrown community and the particular way chosen to show how it could have happened was perhaps of secondary consequence.
The second theoretical problem lay in the qiyama itself. The great Resurrection, even if merely regarded as a turning-point in human history and not as a geophysical epoch, was still expected to be a time of evi dent wonders in which the faithful would triumph and their opponents
461

disappear. The dead were to be raised, nature was to be purified, no labour was henceforth to be needed, no sin could be committed, all was to be well. Indeed, personal spiritual perfection was sufficiently won drous already, that the wonders and the transformations of the world at large could readily enougrfbe rendered at such a moment into symbolic terms; thus the " world" of the Isma'IlI religious organization came to an end with the ending of the old system of rankings and their hierarchy (which must have been inappropriate to the isolated com munities anyway); at the Resurrection all the faithful were equal in the realm of religion. But the imam's appearance had led, still less than in the early Fatimid period, to a visible triumph over the Sunni world. The Resurrection was the moment when Hell and Paradise were no longer distant possibilities but immediate actualities. T o justify the high claims, it could be said that the Sunnis had been resurrected in that they had been offered the opportunity—which Isma'Ilism had not offered before—not merely of a high promise and meanwhile a deeper insight, but of the immediate, perfected living of the life of the spirit unencumbered by sharfa; and in the Sunnis' refusal they had ipso facto been judged and condemned to a spiritual non-existence that was all the more absolute the more complete was the spiritual reality offered them. But the doctrine of the qiyama introduced a further element which distinguished the Isma'ills from the Sunnis more graphically: the figure of the imam-qa'im. Turning back to various religious traditions of the Islamic region, Muhammad II pointed to a darkly known figure, the eternally living man Elijah, who had been swept up to heaven, and Enoch, and, in a more strictly Islamic context, Khidr, the Qur'anic figure whose literary ancestry went back not only to Elijah but to Utnapishtim in the Gilgamesh epic and to Alexander's cook, who had drunk of the water of life and would live forever. Khidr had been adopted by the Sufis as an eternally wandering mystic, ready to bring material and spiritual sus tenance to lonely dedicated Sufis in their hour of extremest need. Among some Christians Melchizedec, the priest forever whom Abraham honoured and who was a type of Christ, had likewise cap tured the imagination. This ever-living, recurrently reappearing figure of unlimited ^wisdom and irresistible authority had always been at best marginal to the Sunni world, mysterious and inaccessible. Muham mad II now identified with that figure the imam-qa'im, the special imam who was master of the qiyama.



M U H A M M A D II: F O R M U L A T I O N OF T H E D O C T R I N E
Some Isma'ilis (and not only Isma'Ilis among the ShFis) had always been inclined to exalt 'Ali over Muhammad, the imam over the prophet, on the ground that the inward meaning of external symbols (the meaning that cAli was charged with teaching) was of higher status than the external symbols themselves (which Muhammad had brought). Until now, however, such a doctrine was not admitted officially among the Isma'ilis, perhaps lest it undermine the status of the shari'a. Muhammad II now adopted it, and, by identifying cAli as a figure with Melchizedec and Khidr-Elijah, he endowed the newly exalted imam with all the potency of their tradition. What had happened in the qiyama, then, was much more than any mere conquest of the Sunni world might have been, an event already foreshadowed in the time of the Fatimids. Into a different world, the elusive world of KhidrElijah, which the Sunnis only glimpsed in fragments of legend or occasional momentary experiences of Sufis, the Isma'ilis had been admitted in full and permanently. It was as if Dailam and Kuhistan had been wrapt, like Elijah himself, and carried out of sight of the Sunnis, and their inhabitants were privileged to walk, as on everyday ground, the sacred soil upon which Moses removed his shoes to tread, when, in the incident of the burning bush, God spoke to him through Melchizedec, the imam-qa'im of his time.1
Isma'ilism and Sufism
It is not easy to estimate what all this could mean, substantively and psychologically. For some, transcendence of ordinary life by way of symbolism was probably quite enough. A t the very least, the qiyama meant the declaration of the Isma'ilis' psychological independence from the world outside, an independence in some ways quite real once the wider revolt was abandoned; and this abandonment was likewise symbolized in the qiyama, in that it declared the Sunni world irrelevant. For others, the qiyama could mean a personal transformation. This was summed up in the doctrine that the perfected faithful should no longer see anything but the imam, and G o d in the imam. The great boon of Paradise, according to Muslim tradition, was

that there one could see G o d face to face. In the Paradise of the qiyama, the locus of divinity was the imam, now reinterpreted as the Eli)ah-Khidr-Melchizedec figure. The imam was God made visible. T o see the imam was to see God—and it was in this seeing that Paradise essentially consisted, not in being in Rudbar or in Kuhistan. But to see the imam was a matter of viewpoint. T o see just the body of the imam (which might, moreover, appear to have its imperfections) was useless: one had to see him in his spiritual reality. If one saw the imam, i.e. understood and concentrated on him in his spiritual reality, then all else that one saw and did would follow from that—one would see the whole world from his viewpoint and no longer from one's own personal vantage-point at all: one would see the imam only and not oneself, as they put it. Thus one would live the totally enlightened and spiritual life which was the afterlife the Isma'ills had expected—and it would make no difference whether this was in the body or not. Accordingly, in the qiyama the faithful were sum moned not to the worship of God, which was their own imperfect activity, but to God Himself, now present in the imam, in Whom their own selves no longer mattered. The imam, then, was to serve for the Isma'ills as a Sufipir sometimes did for his disciples. They were to cultivate their own divine awareness by focusing their attention on him, seeing the divine presence hidden within him, and forgetting their separate selves. But the imam was more than a Sufi pir. Muhammad II is reported to have written his discourses in the language of the philosophers, and certainly he made use also of the Isma'lli tradition. The doctrine of the qiyama and its discipline formed a new synthesis among traditions. The imam was not simply one experienced Sufi teacher among many, who might be the object of a transference process in those disciples who chose to explore their inward selves under his guidance. Beyond that, he was felt to be a unique, single cosmic individual who summed up in his position the whole reality of existence; the perfect microcosm, for whom no lesser pir could be substituted. In him the faithful found not only a guide to personal awareness but also the embodiment of a whole symbolic system in terms of which he could place himself in the whole cosmos. This new sense of the cosmos into which the. deepening sense of self-awareness fitted was described in Isma'ili terms as a third level of being, in effect a batin behind the batin. This third level, that of ultimate reality, went beyond the old Isma'ili interpretations of the sharfa as



ISMA'IIISM AND SUFISM
these had gone beyond the sharfa itself. On that level all things were one in the imam. Only personal relations counted, for only persons had an inward, spiritual life; and even persons, when perfect, were merged into their idealized roles as expressions of cosmic harmony. Every imam, when seen rightly, was seen to be 'All; every disciple was again Salman, the faithful disciple of Muhammad and adherent of 'AH. The accidents of space and time did not matter. On this level not only the arbitrary rules of the sharfa were pointless, but even the hierarchic ally organized discipline of the Isma'ili organization in the time of taqiyya. The qiyama was a declaration of spiritual adulthood, in which all rules and discipline were outgrown and the individual acted directly from his inmost self—which was at one with all the rest of existence in the present and revealed imam. Even this cosmic aspect of the qiyama doctrine contained much that was analogous to the doctrines of cosmic unity professed by the Sufis of that time and especially later. The cosmic position of the imam was very like that of the Perfect Man, who is the microcosm, i.e. the final end of creation in that G o d brings the world to full consciousness of Himself through that saint. But such general and abstract teachings about an invisible Perfect Man, or qutb among the Sufis, could not offer a full equivalent of the sense of joint spiritual experience which the Isma'ilis seem to have shared in the presence of their quite visible and present one true imam, who was at once pir and qutb. On the whole, the doctrine of the qiyama seems to have had far less impact on the Sunni world than did Hasan-i Sabbah's doctrine of ta'lim. Until the time of Juvaini, writing after the fall of Alamut, the Sunni chroniclers and theologians seem scarcely to have been aware of it. T o be sure, if it had any effect it would have been among the Sufis, to whose ideas the doctrine was most congenial, and who travelled widely and were commonly receptive to new ideas; and movements of thought among the Sufis were little chronicled by the standard authors unless they caused special scandal. The Sunni Sufi doctrines of cosmic unity and of the Perfect Man, in fact, were brought to full flower only by Ibn 'Arabi, who was eighteen years the junior of Muhammad II. But such ideas were already developing in Sufi circles. Ibn 'Arabi, indeed, made use of Isma'ili concepts and terms, but presumably not of the doctrine of the qiyama. Rather, it was the earlier forms of such doctrines among the Sufis which will have served as suggestions to Hasan II and Muhammad II.

What is more likely is that the doctrine of the qiyama may have in fluenced later Shi'i thinking. If there is one person in Twelver Shi'i history who answers to Ghazali among the Sunnis as legitimizer of philosophy and mysticism, it is Nasir al-Din Tusi, the leading figure in Shi'ism at the time of its revival in the thirteenth century. He was one of the earliest within the Twelver community of a synthesis of the Sufi experience developed among Sunnis with a strongly Shici attitude on the imamate—a synthesis which was later made yet more explicit, with the imam in the role of Perfect Man, and became a primary basis for Shi'i thought under the Safavids. But Tusi himself in his earlier years lived among the Isma'ilis and wrote works of theology for them, expounding the doctrine of the qiyama in a slightly later form, when the imam was again technically hidden (as he was to the Twelvers). It seems likely that later Twelvers did not need the Isma'ili example to suggest to them the possibility of such a synthesis, but in fact that example was present in the most intimate way to one of the Twelver Ships' first and greatest expounders of Sufism.1 In any case, the qiyama laid the foundation for the ultimate identi fication of Nizari Isma'ilism as a Sufi tariqa, which was the guise it appeared in after the fall of Alamut. In the time of the qiyama, the Isma'ilis remained consciously opposed to Sufism as such, yet already they found it convenient to borrow Sufi terminology. Later, when a new taqiyya was necessary after their state could no longer protect them from Sunni wrath, the protean forms of Sufism were easily available to them with almost no alteration in their own ways.
The Resurrection within history
Among the Isma'ilis the qiyama meant, along with independence from the Sunni world and its opinion, an admission of their failure in the attempt to transform that world. The attempt to rival Sunnism within that world came to an end with the revolt itself. From the viewpoint of both Sunnis and Twelver ShFis, however, what mattered was not the end of the revolt as such, which might have made for easier relations, for in any case hostilities continued on both sides. For them the great

THE RESURRECTION WITHIN HISTORY
fact was that the sharf a was abolished. In the time of Ahmad-i 'Attash (494/1100) it could be debated whether the Isma'llls were Muslims, entitled to the privileges and immunities of membership in the Muslim community. A t that time the Isma'llls' chief plea was that they kept the Muslim sharf a law and differed from other Muslims only on the question of the imamate. But now, for those who chose to notice at all the changes within the Isma'lU society, the worst suspicions of the Isma'llls' opponents were confirmed. Rejecting the sharf a, the Isma'llls put themselves beyond the pale of Islam by any obvious standard: variations in the sharf a could be tolerated, but now the Isma'llls were no longer even "people of the Qibla", who performed worship (as prescribed by the sharf a) in the direction of Mecca. Thus they failed the minimal test of adherence to Muhammad's mission. Technically, Paradise was not in history. On the level of ultimate reality, in the doctrine of the qiyama, only the type, i.e. the role that persons played in the eternal drama with the imam, was real; not the dated and placed individual event. A s the faithful was always Salman, so he who rejected the summons was forever 'Umar, banished from Paradise and so in reality non-existent. Yet already in the time of Hasan II warfare with the outsiders seems to have flared up more intensely than it had for some years—warfare waged on a lower level than that of ultimate reality, but necessary in its own way. Ibn Anaz continued his raids in Kuhistan. More significantly, the Rudbarls intensified their quarrel with Qazvin after a lapse of years without much raiding; building a fortress just outside the city, we are told, they harassed it almost to the point of siege (560/1165). In the first half of the reign of Muhammad II, however, the Isma'llls were relatively at peace with their neighbours; or at least we hear little of warfare in either SunnI or Isma'Ill chronicles. A ruler of Ruyan, at odds with the local gentry and with his superior, the ruler of Mazandaran, fled to the Isma'llls for refuge and with their help carried out some raids—in which he was worsted. But for the most part little of headline note happened among the Iranian Isma'llls. In Syria it was the time of the Muslim struggle to oust the Crusaders, of Nur al-Dln and Saladin. There the Isma'llls were under the leadership of Rashid al-Dln Sinan, a companion of Hasan II who seems to have been sent there to introduce the doctrine of the qiyama. He was occupied in consolidating the independence of the Isma'Ill fortresses, which straddled the line between Muslims and Franks, and also in establishing

468
their relations with their several neighbours. He seems to have inter preted the qiyarna in his own way, perhaps with relatively little reference to Muhammad II, and to have managed a quite personal foreign policy in his very limited territory. There was a rumour that Alamüt would have liked to be rid of him. Nonetheless, at his death there was no question of the succession: Alamüt appointed the chief in Syria as elsewhere. In the last sixteen years or so of Muhammad IPs reign—after Sinán's death (588/1193), that is—we hear increasingly of petty warfare in which the Isma'ilis were often on the defensive. The Kühistánis had trouble with the rulers of Sistán to the south and then with the rulers of Ghür (the great Ghürid dynasty that overwhelmed the Ghaznavids), who delighted in destroying any Isma'ilis whom they might chance to discover in their path. The Isma'ilis were reduced to making humble terms with the Ghürid Ghiyáth al-Din, when he was setting about conquering Khurasan; and when his brother began attacking them all over again, they had to beg Ghiyáth al-Din to intervene with him in their favour. Rüdbár had trouble again with Mázandarán, supporting a rebel ruler of Rüyán—evidently with such success that the Isma'ilis were granted some villages as a reward. Then the Khwárazmians established themselves as the partisans of Qazvin against the Isma'ilis, taking the place of the Saljuqs; but their activities were relatively minor and at least partly defensive. Though the Isma'ilis of Rüdbár could still undertake daring ventures, one gets the impression that many Isma'ilis had grown used to peace and did not care for interruptions of their commercial activity. Occasionally assassination was still used, but in one case, the assassination of the Ghürid Shiháb al-Din, the Isma'ilis laid claim to an act which may well not have been their own—and did so as a pretext for winning favour with the rising Khwárazmian power, enemy of the Ghürids. Even the vigour of Rüdbár could be turned to winning tributary villages in alliance with a Sunni ruler. Politically the Ismá'ili situation carried little glamour.1
IV. A C C O M M O D A T I O N
The great revolt, after it was contained, was followed by a period in which the Isma'ilis, even while retaining the doctrines and viewpoints of the revolt itself, in fact were defending a limited territorial state

against its neighbours. Such ideals were at odds with such a practice. The high sense of mission the Isma'llls retained had led finally to the proclamation of the spiritual Resurrection and to the whole inwardturning discipline of the qiyama, in which they tried to raise their own little society to the highest conceivable level of human realization and relegated the rest of the world to insignificance. But again the bold effort was checked, though again not fully defeated. The outer world refused to remain insignificant; but what was more important, for an effort aimed at inner perfection rather than outer empire, the effort faltered internally. It failed in the person of the imam himself; but not only in him. In the fourth and last phase of the Isma'Ill state, the Isma'llls retained the ideal of perfection but restricted it to a limited spiritual sphere and in fact were working out an accommodation, both inward and external, with its human and historical limitations. The rising generation wanted peace and normalcy. After some hesitation they did not wholly reject (as did their imam for himself) the ideal of the qiyama; but they adapted it to a more limited estimate of the human condition. Then they supplemented its crippled inward grandeur with revived political ambition: ambition both within the Sunnl world and even beyond it, not hesitating to dream of material world domination. Thus the sense of mission persisted, if anything growing more com prehensive as the Isma'Ill state itself grew weaker.
Hasan III: recognition of Sunnism
The shift of phase was more unmistakably marked at the end of the time of the qiyama than it had been at the end of the active revolt. That the death of Muhammad Tapar and the abandonment of Shirglr's siege of Alamut would be the end of generalized military involvement became evident only in the years that followed. The end of the effort for perfection in the qiyama was announced as abruptly as had been the qiyama itself. Muhammad II's son Hasan did not like the Isma'Ill isolation and rejected the doctrine of the qiyama. Relations between father and son were strained during Muhammad's last years, and it is said they each went in mortal fear of the other; but there is no reason to suppose, as some later claimed, that Muhammad was murdered when he died at a ripe age (607/1210). In any case, Hasan Ill's accession was well
469



T H E ISMA'ILI S T A T E
470
prepared. From an Isma'ili point of view he was undeniably the imam: he had received the irrevocable designation by the preceding imam and whatever he ordered was to be received in faith. A t the same time, Hasan had written to a number of Sunni rulers assuring them that he abjured Isma'Illsm and intended to lead his flock into the fold of Sunni Islam. Accordingly, his accession was accepted by the Isma'llls and acclaimed by the Sunnis too. Many Sunni rulers were glad to receive by conversion the dread enemy whom they had never been able to overcome by conquest. Hasan's rights to the territory which the Isma'llls happened to hold were acknowledged, and he was accepted as a Sunni amir among other amirs. This did not happen without effort, however. Hasan's mother, said to have been a Sunni from the first, went on pilgrimage to Mecca under the patronage of the Caliph al-Nasir and received an honoured place in the Baghdad caravan. A t Mecca the pilgrims from Syria challenged the honour paid to her, and so to the ex-lsma'llls, and a fracas ensued. But Hasan did his best to convince everyone that the community was really reformed and had readopted the sharl'a—this time, the Sunni sharl'a, not the Shi'I sharl'a which Hasan's grandfather had done away with. He had every village build a proper mosque and also a bath, to prove its status as a full-fledged centre of normal Muslim life; we know that this was done at least in some places in Syria. He imported Sunni scholars (of the Shafi'I school) and insisted that all his people obey them. The Qazvinis naturally remained sceptical, recalling the Isma'ili propensity to taqiyya, or dissimulation of their true religious position; he allowed their religious scholars to come up into Alamut and burn whatever they disliked of the books in the famous library—a procedure which, like many men of religion, they found much to their taste and which seems to have won them over. Thus from chief of an execrated and increasingly marginal sect, Hasan made himself into a celebrated hero, whose actions reverberated throughout the Islamic lands. What remained unchanged was that his repute and the role he could play still waxed far out of proportion to the material resources of his little state.
All the Isma'ili territories seem to have obeyed Hasan's orders with out any question. Whether he laid claim to the dignity publicly or not, he was still the imam: indeed, he never renounced the power which was based on that position, even though he denounced the position that had brought him the power. Hasan himself was almost certainly



H A S A N III: R E C O G N I T I O N O F S U N N I S M
sincere in his adoption of Sunnism. His people, however, almost certainly regarded his action as a reimposition of taqiyya; and, given the extensive meaning that had been assigned to taqiyya by implication when its lifting was decreed at the qiyama, this could imply any sort of accommodation with the world, even to the concealment, doctrinally, of the person of the imam. In fact, the adoption of the Sunni sharfa brought immediate tactical advantages in both Kuhistan and Syria, though Rudbar had been less threatened and now benefited less politically. In Kuhistan, the Ghurid attacks were effectively ended. In Syria the Isma'ilis had just got into serious trouble with the Franks and now received opportune assistance from Aleppo. The Isma'Ilis found occasion to reciprocate the Sunni friendliness. Toward the end of Hasan's reign the Mongol terror swept over much of the Islamic lands, including Khurasan. Many refugees, and in particular Sunni scholars, found asylum in the Isma'ili towns of Kuhistan (these were relatively less attractive, or less accessible, to the Mongols), and they were given lavish hospitality by the head of the Isma'ilis there, himself a scholar.
Hasan Ill's reform was accepted sufficiently by his own people to allow him not only to impose it without recorded disruption in all their territories, but even to leave Rudbar, accompanied by an Isma'ili army, for a couple of years of foreign adventure without losing control at home. When Hasan first acceded to power, he had the khutba recited in the name of the Khwarazm-Shah, the most potent monarch in Iran at the time and successor to the Saljuqs. However, fairly soon he shifted to the alliance of the Caliph al-Nasir, the great opponent of the Khwarazmians. The caliph was in a position to show Hasan much honour—as in the pilgrimage of his mother; then Hasan wanted to marry into the noble Sunni houses of Gilan, and the caliph's letters persuaded those nobles to allow their daughters to go to Alamut. Perhaps even more important, the shift brought with it an alignment with Oz-Beg of Azarbaijan, an important member of the caliph's alliance. Hasan seems to have struck up a real friendship with that other ruler; when they decided to make a joint campaign, Hasan went to his court for a long stay to make preparations.
The campaign was a major one. 'Iraq-i 'Ajam was a primary point of contention between the Khwarazm-Shah and the caliphal alliance. The Azarbaijani forces had succeeded in gaining control of the greater part of it, but then Mengli, Oz-Beg's lieutenant there, made

-himself independent and threatened seriously to weaken the alliance. The caliph persuaded troops to come from as far away as Syria to help Oz-Beg, but Hasan's help seems to have been reckoned of considerable importance. Oz-Beg subsidized Hasan substantially, and after the victory (which was not a very brilliant one, though immediately effective enough), Hasan was given Abhar and Zanjan. Thus the Isma'Ili state was expanding more decisively than in its whole history since the revolt—not through either settlement or conversion, but simply by annexing tribute-paying dependent territory. Hasan seems to have lost that territory later, presumably to the Khwarazmians. After the campaign, Hasan retired to Rudbar and stayed there. When Oz-Beg's next lieutenant in cIraq-i 'Ajam also broke with him and went over to the Khwarazm-Shah, there was no great campaign; rather, at the caliph's bidding, Hasan sent Isma'ili fida'Is, who assassi nated him. Hasan seems not to have been very venturesome by nature, despite his one fling, and he looked well to the constellation of forces around him: he was the first Iranian ruler to submit to the Mongols after they crossed the Oxus. After an otherwise undistinguished reign of eleven years, he died of dysentery while still a fairly young man (618/1221). His Sunni wives were (most implausibly) accused by his vizier of having poisoned him, and they were done away with; but in principle his Sunni policies were maintained under the nominal head ship of his little son Muhammad III.1
Adjustment of the doctrine
Under Muhammad III (618/1231-653/1255) the salat worship pre scribed by the sharfa was carried on, at least in the main centres, till the end; the community remained officially Sunni. But gradually the sharfa came to be little enforced, and the ideas and practices associated with the qiyama revived. In any case, the community regarded itself as specifically Isma'ili. Muhammad III himself seems to have been brought up as an Isma'ili imam. He clearly accepted that role and probably also felt himself to be dispensed from the sharfa law and perhaps from many other human limitations. However, he was no scholar and probably contributed little personally

to Ismà'ilì thinking; indeed, he seems to have looked to a Sufi pir in Qazvin for his personal spiritual guidance, or at least for some sort of blessing; he sent gifts to the pir as an admirer. If it was not the Sunni teachers of the sharf a, neither was it the imam in person who guided the community spiritually. Rather, it was others, thrown up by the community itself. Hasan III and his Sunnism were not repudiated: they were explained. In the course of this explanation the doctrine of the qiyàma was reinterpreted to allow for ordinary human and historical processes without repudiating the work of Hasan II either. In the process "popular" and folkloric ideas gained a still larger place over against the older learned tradition. The result was a doctrinal system in which the Isma'ilis were prepared to maintain their spiritual independence under almost any circumstances. Their potential affinity to a Sufi tariqa was increased, and the way was further prepared—as it turned out—for the community to survive intact even though the Ismà'ili state itself fell. It was explained that the qiyàma, the resurrection, was not simply a final event but a condition of life which could, in principle, be withheld or granted by the imàm-qa'im to mankind, or to the élite among mankind, at any time. The tacit identification between sharf a law and taqiyya, implied in the teaching of Hasan II, was confirmed, and with it the identification of haqiqa (spiritual reality) with qiyama. Human life, then, alternated between times when reality was manifest and spiritual perfection could be sought directly; and times when reality was veiled and, instead of perfection, even the élite, for the most part, were directed to an outer symbolic acting-out of the tokens of reality, as laid down in the sharf a. Hasan II had introduced a brief period when reality was manifest; Hasan III had closed that period again. This could be because any imam was potentially imàm-qà'im, immediate representative of God on earth, and hence could decree whether there should be a time of qiyàma or not. It was still expected, as earlier among Isma'ilis, that full qiyama would come only at the end of the sixth millennial period after Adam: that is, at the end of the millennial period introduced by the sixth great prophet, Muhammad, which would also be the end of the present cycle (roughly seven thousand years) of history. But within the millennial period of Muhammad, and in special honour of his greatness, there could be anticipatory periods of qiyàma, each one a foretaste of the final period of qiyàma: such was the qiyàma of Hasan II. Correspondingly, the rest of the
473



T H E ISMA'ILI STATE
474
time, when taqiyya and the sharfa prevailed, was a time of satry or "concealment". The term satr had originally referred to those periods when the whereabouts of the imam was unknown to the world at large, or even, at times, to the faithful, as had been the case among Isma'ilis before the rise of the Fatimids and again after the death of Nizar. But now it came to mean not merely concealment of the person of the imam but any concealment of his ultimate reality, of his true religious role as the point where God became visible. In particular, Hasan III was known in his outward person as a wordly ruler, but he chose not to be recognized in his inner reality as imam; hence, despite his physical availability, his reign was a time of satr. Moreover, it was pointed out retrospectively that even the period when the imams ruled in splendour in Egypt and the Isma'lli batin was officially taught in Cairo had been a time of satr. In comparison with the qiyama, all lesser degrees of the imam's manifestation were equally concealment; hence the con cealment ordered by Hasan III differed only in degree from what had happened often before. If reality was to be hidden, it might as well be by imposition of the Sunni sharfa as by that of the Shfi; and the imam might as well deny his own special relation to Muhammad along with his status as visible locus of the divine. Satr, the period of concealment, carrying with it sharfa and taqiyya, was the more normal lot of mankind because of human weakness.1 Even within the period of satr, spiritual reality was not entirely suppressed and could be known on a certain level. A small elite within the community of the faithful could even then look on the reality of the imam and so live the life of spiritual perfection. But, in theory the members of this elite, like the imam himself, were born to their status. In the time of Hasan III and perhaps even, in principle, in that of Muhammad III, this elite may have been reduced to a single figure, the hujja, the "proof" of the imam—a position that had been filled by Hasan-i Sabbah and now again rose to prominence, though we cannot identify the actual individuals who filled it in this last period of the Isma'ill state. It sufficed for most persons to remain on the second level, the level of the batin, understanding what lay behind the sharfa and seeing the secret status of the imam, without going beyond that to the full personal realization in which they beheld nothing but the imam's ultimate reality.
1 O n t h e d o c t r i n e s o f the satr, see OA, p p . 225-37.



ADJUSTMENT OF THE DOCTRINE
For most Isma'ilis, what was primarily retained from the qiyarna times was not so much the hope for spiritual perfection as the imagina tive richness which found its fullest embodiment in the Khidr-ElijahMelchizedec imàm-qà'im figure. If the élite still existed, even in the person of a single man, then at least such secrets could still be expounded, even though they were not fully lived out by most of the faithful; their exposition was what most mattered. Under Muham mad III, however, a way was left open for the practice of qiyarna perfection by the more spiritually minded even of ordinary persons. The faithful were divided into "strong" and " w e a k " , and the "strong" could hope to achieve what seems to have amounted to a status of secondary or derived élite alongside the few élite who were born to their roles. Thus those who were devoted not merely to the imaginative splendour of the qiyarna but also to its moral and spiritual practice could devote themselves to this, freely transcending the sharf a as did the imam and his hujja themselves. With such a distinction, the Isma'ilis moved even closer to the prac tice of a Sufi tariqa, which allowed both for close disciples dedicated wholly to the pir, and for a wider circle of adepts who looked to the pir's wise teachings and especially to his blessing but did not attempt to enter into the pir's spiritual life themselves. The qiyarna was losing even such social dimensions as it had still had under Muhammad II, when it was the foundation for the life of the whole state, and was becoming, like the Sufi mystical life, a special vocation for an individually selected few. Even so, the Isma'ili imam retained his unique cosmic position, to which a flesh-and-blood Sufi pir, himself no qutb or Perfect Man, could not pretend. The only religious writings which we can certainly date to the time of Muhammad III are those ascribed to Nasir al-Din Tusi, who figures as the most important Isma'ili writer of the whole period of the satr following Hasan III. Legal work of his—presumably Shfi rather than Shàffi—expounded the sharf a for later Iranian Isma'ilis; his theo logical works expounded the spiritual situation under conditions of satr. In them he answered with sophistication the numerous problems of detailed adjustment which arose when the doctrines of the satr and of the qiyarna, and also of Fàtimid Ismà'ilism were mutually confronted; and he dealt with the more strictly philosophical problems that arose in the new doctrine taken for itself. (He was also very careful to give as little leeway as possible to those who might wish to fancy themselves

among the "strong"—who must have been rather too numerous in fact.) We have from him a work of technical precision on Isma'ili theology, and a briefer work clearly designed for the ordinary Isma'ili, yet written with a wonderfully succinct clarity. Moreover his famous work on ethics was originally dedicated to an Isma'ili chief in Kiihistan and furnished with an Isma'ili preface.1 Tusi may not have been, even then, an Isma'ili; later he was certainly a Twelver. But it was not entirely by chance that the Isma'ills were able to make use of the services of so able a writer. From the time of Hasan III, at least, though especially after the Mongol holocaust, they attracted to their libraries and to their learned patronage a large number of scholars like him, if not quite so eminent, from the outer world. Such scholars were free to maintain their prior religious convictions, and though Tusi and some of the other non-lsma'lll scholars who were in Rudbar at the time of the Mongol invasion claimed that they were being kept there by force, it seems unlikely that such force long antedated the Mongol invasion itself, when special measures must have been unavoidable. At any rate, they were on terms of mutual confidence with the Isma'ili leadership. The Isma'ills of the satr had worked out a religious system which allowed the most extreme spiritual daring of their heritage to coexist with a folkloric Shi'i imaginativeness and even with the religious scholarship of the wider Muslim world. In such an atmosphere, their out-of-the-way fortresses were becoming centres of an intellectual life no longer limited to their own particular tradition; perhaps more important, the Nizari Isma'ili tradition itself was ceasing to be necessarily dependent upon the Isma'ili state as such.
Persisting ambitions
As in religion, so in political action the Isma'ills developed a flexible policy, one which allowed for co-operation with the Sunni powers without abandonment of Isma'ili solidarity or even of Isma'ili ambitions. In this sphere also Muhammad III was not the central figure, though he played his role. In his first years he was a minor, having become imam at the age of nine, and the chiefs of the community acted with little reference to him—and without leaving much trace of quarreling among themselves. When he grew up he seems to have been moody and capable of violent fits of anger; he could be drunk for

days at a time. The chroniclers have accused him of being mentally deranged, and say that his courtiers were afraid to bring unpleasant news to him; but in fact he seems to have kept pretty well in touch with events and was probably less brutal and unpredictable than many another tyrant born to absolute power. Nevertheless, though he maintained his authority effectively enough, most of the initiative in practical decisions probably came from others.1 Muhammad Ill's reign began (618/1221) just after the first wave of the Mongol conquest had destroyed the Khwarazmian power. The scholarly refugees came to the Isma'ili towns at this time, not simply because they were out of the way and so ignored by the Mongols, but because at that point the Isma'ili state was proving stronger than most. The prudently early submission to the Mongols, which gave it an initial immunity, did not preclude an independent policy. In Kuhistan the Isma'ills maintained an island of prosperity and stability from which all benefited when in so many other places even what the Mongols had spared was being disrupted by the lesser warrings they left in their wake. The scholarly gentleman Shihab al-Dln, a ruler whom even bigoted Sunnis spoke highly of, aroused complaints that his policy of wholesale hospitality was lavishing too freely the resources of the community upon non-Isma'Ili strangers, and he was eventually replaced. But Shams al-Dln, the replacement, sent from Alamut, also compelled respect among the Sunnis. After an attempt on his life by a Sunni foreigner, he was able to prevent a spontaneous lynching of all the resident Sunnis, taking soldierly command of a mob situation and drastically enforcing order. The Kuhistanis were able to take a forward policy in Sistan, but by and large they limited their objectives to defence. Sunnis whose style of life had been interrupted by the Mongols could go to Kuhistan to renew their wardrobes, and the main burden of negotiations between the Isma'ills and their neigh bours seems to have been the reopening of trade.
In Rudbar the Isma'ili policy was more aggressive, though in one sense it likewise was on the side of order, being favourable to the caliph and opposed to Khwarazmian disruption. In the first six years after the fall of the Khwarazmian empire, the Isma'ills annexed a number of places, including Damghan near Gird-Kuh. A t some point, perhaps earlier but most probably in this period, they seized other places in Qumis, presumably in the Zagros mountains, and in the Tarum

THE ISMA'ILI STATE

mountains of western Dailam where once they had had little foot hold. The arrival of the Khwarazmian adventurer Jalal al-Din put an end to this expansion. The old Isma'ili quarrel with the Khwarazmians was renewed with him. A Khwarazmian chief who had raided Isma'ili Kuhistan was assassinated, and Jalal al-Din's vizier was secretly sur rounded by Isma'ilis in his service, ready to cut him down at a word from the imam (these latter were burned alive when their presence was revealed—and Alamut was duly compensated financially for their deaths). Before long the Isma'ilis agreed to pay Jalal al-Din tribute for Damghan; but they continued to co-operate with both the caliph and the Mongols in opposition to him. The heirs to power in both Azarbaijan and 'Iraq-i 'Ajam whom he had dispossessed took refuge in Rudbar and received Isma'ili help. After the death of Jalal al-Din in 628/1231, the Isma'ili began to shift their hostilities once more: from the Saljuqs they had shifted their enmity to the Khwarazmians, who were the Saljuqs' most powerful successors; from the Khwarazmians they shifted it now to the Mongols. The Mongols took Damghan from them, the only major (and Sunni) city that they then had a garrison in. The breach with the Mongols became decisive only after more than a decade, when the Mongols refused to recognize the Isma'ili envoys in Mongolia. The breach may have been exacerbated by the attitude of Muhammad III, who even tually, at least, proved much more insistent than most Isma'ili leaders in resisting the Mongols. But it was made inevitable by an outlook which was popular with the Isma'ilis quite independently of the imam's atti tude. The Isma'ilis continued, as before, to be involved in neighbouring quarrels: again supporting a chief of Riiyan against his overlord in Mazandaran, for instance. But in the open political situation that the first Mongol operations had left behind, they were envisaging a field of action wider than had been possible since the time of Hasan-i Sabbah. Soon after the death of Hasan III, Isma'ili agitators were already at work in Ray, evidently looking toward winning a new popular following and perhaps arousing a new general revolt. Syrian Isma'ilis, on a rumour of Jalal al-Din's death, boasted to the ruler of Anatolia that the Isma'ilis of Rudbar would now take over all 'Iraq-i 'Ajam, whose previous Khwarazmian ruler was a refugee among them. Prophecies of how the imam was going to conquer the world had long appeared in Isma'ili works, but we find an unusually detailed prophecy in one of



PERSISTING AMBITIONS
Tusi's works of this period. After occupying Dailam, the imam would conquer the several other districts south of the CaspianMazandaran, Gllan, and Mughan—and would then carry the holy war to India, China, and Europe—that is, to all the main civilized regions, beyond the Islamic lands in the eastern hemisphere. A t this juncture, all this need not have seemed too fantastic. The nearest we know of Isma'ills getting to China is by way of embassies in Mongolia. But Indian tradition places the first Nizarl Isma'ili missionary activity, which produced the Khoja sect there, at just this time. And the Isma'ills are reported to have sent envoys in 1238 to the courts of France and England in Western Europe to try to arrange for joint action by Christians and Muslims against the Mongols: a project which would presuppose the Isma'ills still having some common understanding with the caliph, even that late in Muhammad Ill's reign. Popular fantasypresumably not discouraged by the Isma'ills—represented many of the rulers of the earth as sending regular ransom payments to the Isma'llis, at least to those in Syria, to avoid being assassinated; kings were named as distant as the Yemen and Germany and Spain. But pretensions to any sort of world domination could only conflict irreconcilably with the overrriding ambitions of the Mongols, who regarded themselves as the only masters of the world.1
The collapse
The Isma'ills were playing a larger role in the outer world after the first Mongol conquests than they had played since the original revolt, and their political structure, like their intellectual life, seems to have been vigorous and sound. Nevertheless, they had not ceased to be a marginal power in territory and manpower. Though the Buyid family had once dominated all western Iran on the basis of the loyalty of Dailam and of its peasant soldiery, the times called for more than the stop-gap regime which the Buyids had been able to supply. T o be successful, the Isma'ills would have to depend on the Shi'is of the Islamic lands; but the Shi'a was still at a low ebb then, and most Shi'is had rejected the Isma'ili imams anyway; nor was Alamut in a position to come to an arrangement with Twelver Shi'ism such as Shah Isma'il could later make to found the Safavid state on. In any case, many of the Isma'ills were more concerned to avoid hindrances to

commerce than to conquer the world. The Mongols, on the contrary, were fully serious about their intention to rule everywhere and to suppress every possible rival. With time, the Mongols consolidated their position in Iran, and the Isma'ilis—who, apart from the caliph himself, were almost alone in re maining hostile—became isolated. The welcome accorded Hasan III as a convert had long since been dissipated, and most Sunnis were again eager to see the old enemies of orthodoxy suppressed. A t last Mongke, urged on by Muslims at his court, decided in 650/1252 to send a major expedition against the two powers that still held out in the central Muslim lands: the Isma'ilis and the 'Abbasid caliphate. Hiilegii took his time in making the long trip from Mongolia with the main Mongol force, but his advance armies joined with the Mongol garrisons already in Iran to attack as many Isma'ili fortresses as possible. In Dailam they did little more than raid. They failed to take Gird-Kuh; it seemed impreg nable until disease decimated the garrison, and in that emergency men from Rudbar were successfully thrown in to bring the garrison up to strength: on which the Mongols gave up. They managed to take Tun and some other places in Kiihistan, on which they then concentrated; but later the Isma'ilis regained what had been lost even there. When Hiilegii finally arrived, however, the Mongols more successfully over ran a great part of Kuhistan, destroying Tun and deporting its artisans according to their custom. Then Hiilegii moved toward Rudbar.
This situation seems to have aggravated a tension between Muham mad III and his chief officers, who wanted to come to an agreement with the Mongols. It was said, perhaps for political reasons later, that after the Mongol armies approached, Muhammad's mental aberration became more marked, so that the leading Isma'ilis feared for their lives. Muhammad's son and designated successor as imam, Khur-Shah, had long been on bad terms with his father (it is said the Isma'ilis, holding to their principles, would not let Muhammad designate any other son, though he wished to). Now Khur-Shah likewise began to be frightened. He came to an agreement with the Isma'ili chief men that Muhammad was to be set aside without suffering any harm to his person, and Khur-Shah, as effective regent, was then to negotiate with the Mongols. But before the plan could be put into operation, Khur-Shah fell ill and was confined to his bed. A t this point (653/1255), a favourite of Muhammad's, whom Muhammad had injured, murdered him, Khur-Shah and his advisers set about a change of policy with due



THE COLLAPSE
caution. First they completed a campaign in western Dailam, where the Isma'ills seized a fortress they had been besieging. Then KhurShah sent letters to the neighbouring rulers announcing his father's death and his own accession. A t the same time he ordered all the Isma'ills to follow the shari'a more closely than they had generally been doing, clearly hoping to conciliate the Sunni powers again. Then he sent to the Mongols, offering his submission. Unfortunately, the Mongols were not ready to be satisfied with anything less than total surrender. They required Khur-Shah's personal attendance on Hulegii and the demolition of the Isma'ili fortresses, including Alamut. Khur-Shah asked for a delay of a year in his own appearance and for exemption of Alamut and Lanbasar from the de molition order. Meanwhile the chiefs in Gird-Kuh and in Kuhistan sub mitted personally, but the fortress nonetheless held out. Khur-Shah was finally permitted to send his son in his place, but the seven-year-old lad was sent back as being too young. By this time, Hulegii himself was near Ray and speeding his pace as he moved nearer Rudbar; he demanded that Khur-Shah demolish immediately at least Maimun-Diz, the fortress where he was staying, and then come himself to Rudbar. Khur-Shah still lingered, and suddenly found himself besieged in Maimun-Diz by the full Mongol force. There is some evidence that, given the spirit of an earlier time, the key Isma'ili fortress might have been held at least long enough to persuade Hulegii that some accommodation, leaving the Isma'ili power humbled but still essentially intact, would be expeditious. The Mongols them selves were doubtful whether they should press the siege of MaimunDiz at that time; subsequently, when they found how massively constructed and well-provisioned were such fortresses as Alamut, they congratulated themselves on their good fortune in persuading their master to surrender them. Muhammad III may have been correct in his calculation that the Isma'ills could resist the Mongols as well as they had the Saljuqs or the Khwarazmians. Indeed, the Isma'ili spirit was not wholly gone. N o traitors are recorded, and at least Gird-Kuh, which later elected to resist despite Khur-Shah's final surrender, held out alone for a long time. But Khur-Shah seems to have listened to the foreign scholars at the court, such as Nasir al-Din Tusi, who were eager to see the Isma'ili state at an end, and to be free to taste of the yet larger munificence of the Mongols (which they did); nor did his Isma'ili advisers strongly counteract that influence, though the lesser fida'is

T H E ISMA'ILI STATE

threatened to kill him if he tried to surrender. Before long, Khur-Shah came down to Hulegii's camp, and the greater number of the Isma'ilis followed his lead (654/1256). A devoted band which yet attacked the Mongols as they entered Maimun-Diz was exterminated, and with some trouble most of the fortresses were persuaded by Khur-Shah, now a puppet of the Mongols, to surrender. The Mongols, who could not expect to hold them themselves in a hostile Dailam, undertook the major labour of dismantling them stone by stone. Gird-Kuh and Lanbasar still held out for a time, but isolated they could no longer hope for such succour as had come earlier to GirdK u h from Rudbar; after some years they too had to surrender.1 Meanwhile, the Sunni Muslims persuaded the Mongols to destroy the whole Isma'ili people so far as they could. The library of Alamut was burned as a matter of course (though Juvaini, a Sunni scholar, was first allowed to take out copies of the Qur'an and other "safe" items). Rather less expected was a general massacre of all the Isma'ilis who, exiled from their fortresses, were relatively accessible to the Mongol sword. The men of Kuhistan were summoned to great gatheringspresumably on the pretext of consultation—and slaughtered. The slave markets of Khurasan were glutted with Isma'ili women and children, denied the privileges of Muslims. Khur-Shah was sent to Mongolia but was rejected by Mongke and killed on the way back;2 however, the remnant of the Isma'ilis claimed to have saved and hidden away his son to father a continuing line of imams.3 In the next decades there were attempts in both Rudbar and Kuhistan to restore the Isma'ili state, but without success. The Syrian Isma'ilis, situated at the farthest limit of the Mongol tide, barely managed to survive it, only to become dependent on the Mamluk state, whose ruler they were bound to furnish with assassins on demand. In Iran, the surviving Isma'ilis at last took refuge in obscurity, cloaked by the forms of a Sufi tariqa whose pir was the imam.

CHAPTER 6
THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONDITION
OF IRAN UNDER THE ÏL-KHÂNS
We can distinguish the following periods in the socio-economic history of Iran during the Mongol dominion. The first period—from the twenties to the nineties of the thirteenth century—is marked by the colossal economic decline of Iran, caused both by the devastation wrought during the Mongol conquest, and still more by the administrative practices, in particular the taxation policy, of the first conquerors (the viceroys of the Great Khan, and then from 1256 the Il-Khans). Typical phenomena of the time are a reduction in population and cultivated land, the decline of agriculture, the migration of fresh multitudes of Mongol and Turkish nomads, and the expansion of migrational cattle-breeding, a decline in urban life, the growth of tendencies of natural economy, an increase in state taxes and feudal rent, the attachment of peasants to the soil, and the growth of a peasant insurrectionary movement. The second period—from the nineties of the thirteenth century to the middle thirties of the fourteenth century (to the death of Il-Khan Abu Sa'id in November 13 3 5) is characterized by something of an economic upsurge, especially in agriculture, as a result of the reforms of Ghazan. During this and the following periods conditional private ownership of land and large-scale unconditional landownership expanded at the expense of state and small-scale peasant landowning. The economy of the country did not however attain its pre-1220 level. The third period extends from the mid-thirties to the eighties of the fourteenth century (to the beginning of Timur's conquest). This period is marked by feudal dismemberment, the struggle for power of feudal groups, and the political disintegration of the Il-Khanid state as a result. This disintegration began in 1336 and was completed in 1353 on the occasion of the killing of the last Il-Khan, Togha-Temiir, and the destruction of his headquarters—ordu—in Gurgan by rebel Sarbadars. The restoration of pre-Ghazan methods of peasant exploitation provoked violent rebellions among the peasantry (the Sarbadars of Khurasan in 1337-81, analogous movements in Mazandaran and Gilan

from the fifties to the seventies of the fourteenth century, and others), which were supported by minor Iranian landowners as well as urban artisans.
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE MONGOL INVASION
In the Middle Ages invasions by conquering nomads of cultivated settled areas were normally devastative. The Saljuq conquest of Iran in particular was accompanied by pillage and destruction.1 The destruc tive nature of the invasion of Khurasan by the Oghuz of Balkh in the fifties of the twelfth century is notorious.2 But the Mongol conquest brought to Iran as it did to other lands destruction and decline on an incomparably greater scale. This was because the conquests of ChingizKhan, uniting under his rule most of the Mongol, Turkish, and other nomads of Central Asia, were accompanied not by spontaneous cruelty, but by the systematic extermination of the civilian population in a series of towns (Balkh, Marv, Nishapur, Herat, Tus, Ray, Qazvin, Hamadan, Maragheh, Ardabil, etc.) and the laying waste of whole regions. This mass-killing was a complete system, put into practice on initiative from above, and had as its goal the planned destruction of those elements of the population that were capable of resistance, the intimi dation of the remainder, and sometimes the providing of pasture for the nomads. Ibn al-Athir spoke of the Mongol invasion as of an enormous universal catastrophe.3 Even the pro-Mongol historian Juvaini, speak ing of the massacres perpetrated by the generals of Chingiz-Khan, concludes with this assertion: " . . . where there had been a hundred thousand people there remained . . . not a hundred souls alive. " 4 More than a century after the invasion, in 740-1339/40, the historian and geographer Hamd Allah QazvinI refers to the "ruin (in the present day) as a result of the irruption of the Mongols and the general massacre of the people which took place in their days" and adds: "Further there can be no doubt that even if for a thousand years to come no evil befalls the country, yet will it not be possible completely to repair the damage, and bring back the land to the state in which it

was formerly."1 Such is the testimony of the contemporaries of the Mongol invasion. Thus the economic and cultural decline of Iran after the conquest, as also of neighbouring lands, cannot be doubted. But we can only con ceive the scale of the decline clearly if we collect and correlate the separate and varying pieces of information given by historians and geographers of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and compare them with information from the pre-Mongol period. The primary result of the Mongol conquest was a fall in population, mostly among the working people in town and country, due to mas sacre and abduction into slavery and captivity, the flight of the remaining population, and the desertion of areas that had been thickly populated at an earlier date. Arab and Persian sources, speaking of the universal slaughter in a series of towns and districts, give figures which stun the imagination. Thus at the taking of Nishápür, in 1220, 1,747,000 men alone are said to have been massacred.2 A t the capture of Marv, according to Ibn al-Athir, about 700,000 people were killed,3 according to Juvaini, 1,300,00o.4 A t the second Mongol capture of Herat, at the end of 1222, 1,600,000 people were said to have been killed.5 The number killed at the capture of Baghdad by Hülegü is fixed by Hamd Allah Qazvini at 8oo,ooo.6 Describing massacres in the lesser towns, the sources give smaller figures: in Nasa 70,000 were killed ;7 in the district of Baihaq (of which the chief town was Sabzavár) 70,000 dead were counted;8 12,000 were killed in Tün (Kühistán),9 and so on. O f course we cannot accept these figures as entirely reliable. Such sizeable numbers are difficult to accept for a population living in a feudal economy, even in the case of such major cities as Nishápür and others like it, and even assuming that the figures refer to the country

districts surrounding the towns. But admitting exaggeration, we can not however dismiss these figures as pure products of fantasy: the very fact that such numbers could be given, and in different sources, both pro- and anti-Mongol in orientation, implies a grandiose scale of mass-extermination, astounding the imagination of contemporaries. So does the fact that such towns as Ray were never rebuilt and re mained uninhabited and in ruins for centuries. We should take into consideration also that many people were led away into slavery and captivity, or died of epidemics or hunger—the normal concomitants of foreign invasion.1 Taking all this into account, we cannot doubt that between 1220 and 1258 the population o f Iran declined several times over, the northern and eastern areas suffering most of all. Regrettably, the sources do not contain any overall figures for the population of Iran before and after the Mongol conquest. Khurasan suffered most o f all. Yaqut in the second decade of the thirteenth century speaks of the prosperity of the districts of Khurasan.2 According to Nasawi, all the towns and castles had been ruined and the major part of the population both in the towns and the rural areas either killed or carried off into slavery during the first Mongol invasion of Khurasan in 1220-23, whilst the young men had been taken away for employment in siege operations; the conquerors left nobody in peace.3 JuvainI says that in a couple of months, Tolui so ravaged many regions of Khurasan that he made them like the "palm of the hand".4 Writing about the year 720/1321 Saifl cites the stories of old men, based on the memories of eye-witnesses, to show that at the time of the invasion there were in Khurasan "neither people, nor corn, nor food, nor clothing",5 and that "from the frontiers of Balkh as far as Damghan people ate only human flesh, dogs and cats for a whole year,6 because the warriors of Chingiz-Khan had burnt down all the granaries".7 What life was like in the Herat region of Khurasan, one can judge from the stories of Saifi: after the slaughter of 1220 only sixteen

THE CONSEQUENCES OF T H E MONGOL INVASION
people survived in the city of Herat, and only forty, if we include fugitives from other places,1 whilst not more than a hundred survivors remained in the surrounding countryside.2 Saifi relates a vivid tale drawn from the memories of old men about the life of the forty chance survivors in their ruined and devastated city: first they fed upon the corpses of animals and men, then for a period of four years this handful of people were only able to get food by attacking passing caravans; and this too at distances of from 150 to 800 kilometres from Herat.3 When in 1236 the Great Khan Ogedei gave assent to the rebuilding of Herat and brought back some of the weavers (Jdma-bdfdn) who had been carried off into captivity, these latter had first of all to restore one of the canals that had been destroyed and then to harness themselves to the plough and sow corn, because there were neither peasants nor cattle in the countryside around the town.4 The Balkh region, according to Yaqut,5 at the beginning of the thirteenth century before the Mongol conquest abounded in riches, producing silk and such a quantity of corn that it was the granary of the whole of Khurasan and Khwarazm. From the life of the great Persian poet and mystic Jalal al-Din Rumi we learn that Balkh had about 200,000 inhabitants in the twelfth and at the beginning of the thirteenth centuries.6 The Mongols sacked it, massacring the whole population.7 Travellers who passed through Balkh, the Chinese Taoist Ch'ang-ch'un (1223),8 Marco Polo (the second half of the thirteenth century),9 and Ibn Battuta (the thirties of the fourteenth century),10 inform us that it and its environs were derelict and deserted. After the Marv oasis had been destroyed three times by the Mongols (1221-3), its agriculture and the dam on the river Murghab were ruined, cattle had been driven away, and corn had been taken. Massacre followed massacre until "in the town and the villages there were not a hundred souls alive and not enough food even for these enfeebled f e w " . 1 1 In Tus only fifty houses remained occupied.12 Nishapur was

completely empty and ruined after the wholesale slaughter;1 in the town there was not a wall still standing and the rural area was also devastated.2 According to the poet Nizari, many villages were still deserted in Kuhistan in the seventies, the town of Qa'in being still without water;3 12,000 people had been killed in Tun; all the Isma'ilis in Kuhistan had been slaughtered in accordance with the decree of Hulegii.4 The Mongol conquest took an equally heavy toll in Tabaristan (Mazandaran). In the words of the historian of the region Ibn Isfandiyar (beginning of the thirteenth century) "all land was cultivated from the mountains to the shores of the sea, and villages adjoined one another, so that there was not one span of waste land that did not bear the fruits of the earth";5 here "the whole countryside was garden or orchard, so that the eye saw nothing but green".6 Harvests were such that there were many fresh vegetables at each season of the year and a great quantity of corn, rice, millet, and every kind of meat and fowl ;7 in the area " there had never been poverty, such as there was in other places".8 The same historian states that the region was desolate after the Mongol conquest and that throughout the whole of Khurasan there were crowds of slave-captives from Tabaristan.9 The local historian Zahir al-Din Mar'ashi, writing about 1470, speaks of the terrible devastation of Mazandaran by the Mongols and says that the ruins and heaps of ashes were still there in his time.10 Yaqut wrote of neighbouring Gurgan at the beginning of the thirteenth century as of a rich district, abundant in garmsir (i.e. subtropical) crops and silk. A s an example of the wealth of the region Yaqiit cites the case of an estate which cost 1,000,000 dirhams and was leased for 5 00,000.11 But Hamd Allah Qazvlnl speaks of the destruction of Gurgan by the Mongols, and says that in his time (1340) there were few people living there.12 The decay of the irrigation network is referred to by Ghazan in his decree concerning the cultivation of desolate land.

OTHER FACTORS IN T H E DECLINE
OTHER FACTORS IN THE DECLINE
The dislocation in the life of Iran during the conquest was not however the only cause of the catastrophic decline in the economy of the country. There were other factors aggravating the decline. First of all, the conquest of Iran did not create a stable peace inside the land. The invasions of the armies of the Qi'pchaq and Chaghatai rulers, enemies of the ll-Khans, were almost as destructive as the first Mongol invasion. We shall quote here only one example: in 1295 the Chaghatai ruler Du'a terribly ravaged and burnt the rural areas of Khurasan (especially the Herat oasis), the rural districts of Mazandaran, and the Y a z d oasis, driving 200,000 prisoners (women and children) into servitude.1 Equally devastating were the incursions of the Nigudari Mongols, who led a nomadic existence in Afghanistan and did not recognize the authority of the Il-Khans,2 into Khurasan, Sistan, Kirman and Fars,3 and the punitive expeditions of the Il-Khans themselves against their recalcitrant vassals, or in order to put down popular revolt (for example the revolt in Fars led by the qddi Sharaf al-Din, who pro claimed himself Mahdl in 6 6 3 / 1 2 6 5).4 It is sufficient to say that Khurasan remained desolate;5 the Herat oasis and Herat itself were devastated with the loss of part of the population in 1270, 1288, 1289, 1295, 1306-07 and 1319.6 The increase in the number of nomads in the country had a part in the decline of the economy, especially that of agriculture. Contrary to the opinion of V. V . Barthold that " the Mongol invasion was not con nected, as was the Germanic invasion of the Roman Empire, with transmigration of people ",7 the sources permit us to speak of a con siderable migration of Mongol nomadic tribes into the territory of the Il-Khans,8 not to mention that of Turkish nomads. Some previously agricultural territory became pasture for the nomads, as for example Badghis in Khurasan, where before the Mongol conquest there were

several towns with populations of 2o,ooo-3o,ooo.1 The influence of the nomads proved unfavourable to Iran in the economic sphere. Nomadic cattle-rearing, without knowledge of fodder-grass cultiva tion and based upon cattle being at grass the whole year round, was extensive in character and required great uninhabited expanses of summer and winter pasture. The nomads, always armed and strong by reason of their tribal organization, ruined grass and trampled crops underfoot in their migrations, not scrupling to rob unorganized, unarmed, and defenceless peasants.2 But the political rule of the nomads or, more exactly, of their feudal military aristocracy, who re garded the subjugated Persians as a permanent source of plunder and revenue and no more, also created great difficulties for Iran. Because, although nomad cattle-breeding was known in Iran from ancient times,3 it had never occupied as important a position in the economy, as it did under the Mongols and later. Neither under the Umayyads, nor even under the Saljuqs did the military nobility of nomad tribes play such a leading role, as it did under the Il-Khans and their succes sors, the Jalayirids, Qara-Qoyunlu, Aq-Qoyunlu, and the first Safavids. The most important factor hindering the economic renaissance of the country and contributing to further economic decline was the fiscal policy of the viceroys of the Great Khan, and of the Il-Khans. This policy was particularly hard on peasant farmers, since the taxes were not precisely established, were levied in an arbitrary manner,4 were collected several times over,5 and were often of arbitrary size. We shall speak later in greater detail about the fiscal system of the Il-Khans. Let us for the time being note that towards the end of the thirteenth century the peasants had been brought to the verge of poverty and mass-flight. Thus even those regions which had not fallen prey to the invasion of Chingiz-Khan and Hiilegu, as for example Fars, were ruined. Vassaf gives a typical example of the decline of agricultural productivity in the Fars region. The district of Kurbal, considered one of the most fertile, watered by canals from the river Kur, on which were two large dams (the Band-i Amir and Band-i Qassar),6 yielded about

700,000 kharvars (ass-loads)1 of grain in the annual harvest under Buyid 'Adud al-Daula (949-83). Under the atabeg Sa'd b. Abi Bakr, a vassal of the Il-Khans, the annual harvest there about the year 1260 fell to 300,000 kharvars, and before the reforms of Ghazan fell even further, and the khardj of Kurbal consisted of only 42,000 kharvars of grain.2 The deliveries of grain from the other districts of Fars decreased in a like manner.3 Rashid al-Din gives the following general characterization of the decline of Iran and neighbouring countries before the reforms of Ghazan:
At the time of the Mongol conquest they submitted the inhabitants of great populous cities and broad provinces to such massacres, that hardly anyone was left alive, as was the case in Balkh, Shuburqan, Taliqan, Marv, Sarakhs, Herat, Turkestan, Ray, Hamadan, Qum, Isfahan, Maragheh, Ardabil, Barda'a, Ganjah, Baghdad, Irbil and the greater part of the territories belonging to these cities. In some areas on the frontiers, frequently traversed by armies, the native population was either completely annihilated or had fled, leaving their land waste, as in the case of Uighuristan and other regions that now formed the boundary between the ulus of the Qa'an and Qaidu. So also were several districts between Darband and Shirvan and parts of Abulustan and Diyarbakr, such as Harran, Ruha,4 Saruj, Raqqa and the majority of cities on both sides of the Euphrates, which were all devastated and deserted. And one cannot describe the extent of the land laid waste in other regions as a result of the slaughter, such as the despoiled lands of Baghdad and Azarbaijan or the ruined towns and villages of Turkestan, Iran and Rum [Asia Minor], which people see with their own eyes. A general comparison shows that not a tenth part of the lands is under cultivation and that all the remainder is still lying waste.5
TENDENCIES IN THE SOCIAL POLICY OF T H E IL-KHANS
We can trace two political trends in the upper strata of the Mongol victors and the leading group of Iranian aristocracy allied to them. The supporters of the first trend, admirers of Mongol tradition and the nomadic way of life, were antagonistic to a settled life, to agriculture

and to towns,1 and were supporters of unlimited, rapacious exploita tion of settled peasants and town-dwellers. These representatives of the military feudal-tribal steppe aristocracy regarded themselves as a military encampment in enemy country, and made no great distinction between unsubjugated and subjugated settled peoples. The conquerors wished to plunder both, albeit in different ways, the former by seizure of the spoils of war, the latter by exacting burdensome taxes. The supporters of this policy did not care if they ended by ruining the peasantry and the townspeople; they were not interested in their preservation. The most self-seeking and avaricious members of the local Iranian bureaucracy supported the adherents of this first trend,2 as did the tax-farmers, who closely linked their interest to that of the conquerors and joined with them in the plunder of the settled popula tion subject to taxation—the ra'iyyat. As well as being supported by a small group of nomad aristocrats, closely connected by service with the family of the Il-Khan in his headquarters (prdu) and demesne (inju), the second trend was mainly supported by the majority in the Iranian bureaucracy, by many of the Muslim clergy,3 and by the large-scale merchants. This tendency aimed at the creation of a strong central authority in the person of the Il-Khan, the adoption by the Mongol state of the old Iranian traditions of a centralized feudal form of government, and in connexion with this the curbing of the centrifugal proclivities of the nomad tribal aristo cracy. T o do this it seemed necessary to reconcile the feudal leaders of Iran to the Il-Khan, to reconstruct the disrupted economy of the country, particularly of agriculture, and to foster town-life, trade, and the merchants. Some lightening of the fiscal burden, an exact stabilizing of imposts and obligations (there was no stability in these under the first Il-Kháns) laid upon the raciyyat, and protection from such taxes and services as would ruin them completely, were necessary conditions of this.4 The conflict between these two tendencies is complicated by the

T E N D E N C I E S IN T H E SOCIAL POLICY OF THE I L - K H A N S
conflict between the pristine trends of the Iranian Middle Ages, towards feudal disintegration and feudal centralization. A policy in the spirit of the first tendency predominated under the first six Il-Khans. For this reason, although there was no lack of attempts by individual rulers to rebuild cities and irrigation net works, nevertheless these attempts were not successful, because of the policy of unbounded exploitation of the ra'iyyat—both peasant and city-dweller. Since the work of construction was carried out by unpaid forced labour, it only laid an extra burden upon the ra'iyyat, who were ruined previous to this, and in general such work was not completed.1 The second trend gained the upper hand in the ulus of the Il-Khans during the reign of Ghazan, from 1295 to 1304. His vizier, the historian, Shafi'ite theologian and encyclopaedist Rashid al-Din Fadl Allah Hamadani (1247-1318), who carried out the reforms of this Il-Khan, was the most notable representative and ideologist of this policy. After the publication of the correspondence of Rashid al-Din, we cannot doubt but that his was the initiative in the reforms of Ghazan. In a letter to his son Shihab al-Din, governor of Khuzistan, Rashid al-Din expressed in the following words the idea that it was necessary to keep the well-being of the ra'iyyat up to a certain level, since they were the fundamental payers of taxes:
It is fitting that rulers have three exchequers; firstly of money; secondly of weapons; thirdly of food and clothing. And these exchequers are named the exchequers of expenditure. But the exchequer of income is the ra'iyyat them selves, since the treasuries that I have mentioned arefilledby their good efforts and their economies. And if they are ruined, the king will have no revenue. After all, if you look into the matter, the basis of administration is justice, for if, as they say, the revenue of the ruler is from the army, and the govern ment (saltanat) has no revenue but that paid by the army,2 yet an army is created by means of taxation (md/)y and there is no army without taxation. Now tax is paid by the raciyyaty there being no tax that is not paid by the ra'iyyat. And the raHyyat are preserved by justice. There are no ra'iyyat, if there is no justice.3
This same idea is expressed by Ghazan in a speech made to amirs, i.e. to the Mongol-Turkish military and nomad aristocracy. In this speech he says amongst other things:
1 Jdmt( al-tawdrikh, e d . A l i z a d e , p . 558; cf. Saifi, p p . 440, 444. 2 That is, out of plunder, one-fifth of which went to the state. 3 Mukdtabdt-iRashFdi, pp. 1 1 8 - 1 9 (no. 2 2 ) .

IRAN UNDER T H E ÏL-KHÂNS
I am not on the side of the Tazik1 ra'iyyat. If there is a purpose in pillaging them all, there is no-one with more power to do this than I. Let us rob then together. But if you wish to be certain of collecting grain (taghar)2 and food (ash) for your tables in the future, I must be harsh with you. You must be taught reason. If you insult the ra'iyyat^ take their oxen and seed, and trample their crops into the ground, what will you do in the future? . . . The obedient ra'iyyat must be distinguished from the ra'iyyat who are our enemies.3 How should we not protect the obedient, allowing them to suffer distress and torment at our hands.4
GHAZAN'S REFORMS AND
THEIR CONSEQUENCES
The most important of Ghazan's reforms aimed at restoring the Iranian economy were: a new method of levying the land tax (khardj) and other taxes payable to the divan, fixing a precise sum for each particular area in money or kind to be paid twice yearly, in spring and autumn:5 the cutting by half of the impost on trades and crafts {tamghdf in some towns and its complete abolition in others:7 this measure was intended to assist the revival of town life. Other reforms important for the Iranian economy were enacted during the reign of Ghazan:8 the abolition of bardt, i.e. the system of payment of state liabilities to soldiers, officials, pensioners, and creditors of the state by means of notes drawn against local exchequers, transferring payment on them to peasants, on whose shoulders was thus laid an additional fiscal burden; abolition of the practice of quartering military and official personnel in the homes of the ra'iyyat, which practice, accompanied always by extortion and maltreatment of the taxable population, was one of the heaviest

QUAZAN'S REFORMS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES
impositions upon them; limitation of carriage and postal services, which were a heavy burden; the decree permitting the settlement and cultivation of deserted and neglected land belonging to the Divan and private owners, together with the creation of fiscal incentives; the restoration of the currency and the establishment of a firm rate for silver coin: i silver dinar, containing 3 mithqals of silver = 13-6 grammes = 6 dirhams: the establishment of a single system of weights and measures (using the Tabriz system) for the whole state. It is true that even after these measures taxes were still quite high.1 But in comparison with the previous system of pure club-law and unrestricted pillage, the new regime was an improvement from the point of view of the raciyyat. The decrees of Ghazan, forbidding the use of violence by amirs, their households, servants of the khan, messengers, officials and nomads against the ra'iyyat also played a part in this development. Ghazan also enacted wide-ranging measures for the restoration of the ruined irrigation network2 and for the revival of agriculture.3 The reforms of Ghazan and the temporary transfer of a leading political role in the State from the nomad Mongol-Turkish aristocracy to the Iranian civil bureaucracy made some economic improvement possible, especially in agriculture. Rashid al-Din evidently exaggerated the importance of Ghazan's reforms: Vassaf speaks of them in a more modest manner. Hamd Allah Qazvini however witnesses to the revival of agriculture in his factual description of the state of agriculture in a series of regions: he speaks of rich harvests, low prices, an abundance of foodstuffs, the export of corn and fruit, and so on.4 The effect of Ghazan's reforms was still felt during the reign of his brother Oljeitii (1304-16), when control of affairs remained in the hands of Rashid alDin. The information that we are given concerning the social policy of Abu. Sa'id (1316-35) is contradictory. Vassaf speaks of fresh fiscal oppression and of the arbitrary abuse of power by financial officials about the year 718/1318.5 Fifteenth-century writers like Zahir al-Din Mar'ashi and Daulatshah, on the other hand, describe Abu. Sa'Id as a most ra'iyyat-loving ruler, under whom the country flourished.6 These pieces of information probably contradict one another because they

refer to different periods—either to the beginning of Abu. Sa'Id's reign, when the influence of the nomadic military aristocracy again predominated under the amir and favourite Choban, or to the end of his reign, when the vizier Ghiyath al-Dln Muhammad Rashldl, the son of Rashld al-Dln, reintroduced his father's policy. After the death of Abu. Sa'id civil wars between feudal cliques (connected with the development of a system of military feoffs)1 the political disintegration of Iran and the inclination of certain local dynasties to use pre-Ghazan methods of government put an end to further economic revival. If the earlier Jalayirids (Hasan-i Buzurg, 1340-56, and Shaikh Uvais, 1356-74) had attempted to rule in the spirit of Ghazan,2 the Chobanids, having established themselves in Azarbaijan and Persian 'Iraq (1336-56) and basing their power exclusively on the Mongol-Turkish nomad aristocracy, resurrected the system of unrestricted and unregulated force and the unrestrained pillage of the ra'iyyat. This distinction between the policies of the two dynasties is made by the author of Tcfrikh-i Shaikh Uvais in a story in which he relates the following: A t the gates of Baghdad, before a battle, the amirs of the Jalayirid army said to the amirs of the Chobanid forces: " Y o u are tyrants, but when we left you Azarbaijan it was like Paradise, and we have made Baghdad into a flourishing city"; the Chobanid amirs answered: " W e were in Rum and wrought havoc; you made Azarbaijan flourish, we drove you from it, and ravaged the country as we did before; now we have come here and shall drive you out and ruin this region also."3 In spite of a certain revival at the end of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth centuries, the economy had far from reached its preconquest level. We can deduce this if we compare the numbers of villages in various regions (vilayat) before and after the Mongol conquest. In the vilayat of Herat there were about 400 villages in the tenth century,4 at the beginning of the fifteenth 167.5 In the vilayat of Isfahan alone the number had increased.6

Hamd Allah Qazvini names more than thirty towns that were still in ruins in his time, among them Ray, Khurramabad, Saimara, Tavvaj, Arrajan, Darabjird and Marv. According to the same author some cities had become small towns, such as Qum and Siraf. A series of former towns had become villages such as Hulwan, Mianeh, Barzand, Kirmanshah and Kirind.1 We can judge the condition of Iran's economy in the Il-Khanid period from the tax-returns received by the divan of the central government. According to Vassaf, previous to the reign of Ghazan the divan received each year 18,000,000 dinars,2 according to Hamd Allah Qaz vini the sum was 17,000,000, whilst after Ghazan's reforms the figure rose to 21,000,000 dinars;3 but in 1335-40 the sum was 19,203,800.4 It is interesting to compare these figures with the returns of the Saljuq period (in Il-Khanid dinars) also quoted by Hamd Allah Qaz vini in his work,5 as well as with the figures given in the Risdla-yi Fa/aktyya.6

Thus, according to Hamd Allah Qazvini, the seventeen regions forming the Il-Khanid state paid the central divan 19,203,800 dinars in 13 3 5 -40 as against 100,5 80,000 before the Mongol conquest, both sums being in Il-Khanid dinars. In other words the revenue of the Il-Khanid divan was but 19 per cent of that of the pre-Mongol period, and in some districts even less, 9-13 per cent. Also in the pre-Mongol and Mongol budgets sums which were paid to the divans of vassal landowners and sums

derived from the rent or tax on military fiefs—iqtd\ which had fiscal immunity, were not taken into account. Inasmuch as the situation remained the same in this respect,1 the abrupt fall in tax-receipts can hardly be explained in any other wray than by the general economic decline of Iran. Hamd Allah Qazvini does not give figures for eastern and northern Iran, since all taxes in Sistan, Kuhistan, Khurasan, Gurgan and Mazandaran were expended on the local budgets, and the central divan received nothing at all,2 whilst it received only a tiny share of the local revenue of Gilan—a mere 20,000 dinars.3 The Risdla-yiFalakiyya gives the returns on the rent-tax of khassa lands, i.e. from the private estates of the Il-Khan and his family, according to district:

As is well known, taxes from khassa lands were not paid to the Great Divan (the central divan), but were paid to the private divan o f the khassa for the upkeep of the Il-Khan's quarters and those of his wives and the princes. According to theRisd/a-yi Falakiyya, only 28,3 54,220! dinars were paid annually by divan and khassa lands.4 The divergence in the figures—both the overall figures and those for particular districts quoted in the Nuchal al-qulub and Risd/a-yi Falakiyya—makes us think that the budget given in the latter source cannot refer to 1334-5, as Hinz supposes. The Nu^hat al-qulub in fact gives nominal figures for the years 133 5-40, years of feudal civil strife and peasant uprisings. Accord ing to the daftars not a half of the amount collected under Ghazan was collected.5

Therefore it is possible to assert that the economy of Iran during and especially after Ghazan's reign did not reach its pre-Mongol level. A certain relative improvement was experienced mainly in agriculture. Hamd Allah Qazvini gives reason for thinking that from Ghazan's time the irrigation works of all four types in use from ancient times in Iran—mountain springs, river channels, wells and kdn\, i.e. underground galleries (with clay pipelines, timbering and inspectionwells) for bringing underground water to the surface—were to a considerable extent restored. The same author gives almost complete information concerning the kind of irrigation in use in each district or vildjat.1
THE CONDITION OF AGRICULTURE AT T H E END
OF T H E I L - K H A N I D PERIOD
We can judge the condition of agriculture in Iran after Ghazan's reforms not only from the Nu^hat al-qulub but also from the anony mous Persian agrotechnical tract Kitdb-i cilm-i faldhat u %ird6aty the author of which speaks of himself as a contemporary of Ghazan,2 from regional historico-geographical works, from information given by travellers, and from the letters of Rashid al-Din. According to these sources wheat and barley were cultivated wherever there were water supplies and wherever agriculture had been preserved. The author of the Faldha mentions many kinds of wheat and barley; millet was less widely distributed. Hamd Allah Qazvini names more than twenty districts (including Ray, Qum, Tabriz, Isfahan, all Khuzistan and some regions of Fars and Khurasan) with especially high yields of corn. Bread made from barley or millet, frequently with the admixture of beans, chestnuts, or acorns, was the bread of the poor.3 Rice was grown in the territory near to the Caspian and in a series of regions in Azarbaijan, Persian "Iraq (Zanjan, etc.) and Fars (Kurbal, Firuzabad, etc.), and also in Khuzistan.4 The author of

the Faldha informs us of various methods of cultivating rice. In some areas crops were a hundredfold and more, whilst the best rice was considered to be that of Gilan, the second best being that of Mazandaran. The same author says that under Ghazan experiments were carried out (in which the author took part) to sow the best kind of Indian rice in Iran, but without result.1 Evidently the %urrat2 of the author of the Faldha is wheat-sorghum (anthropogon sorghum). Much dhurrat was sown in the vilayats of Kashan and Isfahan, and the crops are supposed to have been nearly three-hundredfold.3 Rye and oats were unknown in Iran, as now. First place amongst fodder-crops was taken by lucerne,4 used to feed horses, Greek clover was also known.5 Cotton was the most common of the textile plants, the cultivation of which pushed flax and other textile plants into the background. Hamd Allah Qazvini speaks of the cultivation of cotton in a series of regions, some fifty or so, of Persian "Iraq (among them Ray, Qum, Nihavand, Yazd); of Fars—such as Shiraz, Abarquh, Kazarun, Lar; of Kirman, Kuhistan, and Khurasan (Khabushan, Zaveh); throughout the whole of Khuzistan and Gurgan; and also in Mazandaran, Gilan, Qumis, and Azarbaijan.6 According to the author of the Faldha cotton gave its finest crops in the garmslr regions, but was also cultivated on sardsir land,7 primarily in sandy clay areas (rlghum). Fine cotton (narm) and coarse cotton (gibr) were known, but in general Indian cotton was thought of as better than Iranian.8 Flax (kattdn) was less widely grown in the fourteenth century than it had been in the tenth century, mostly in the south-west of Iran (the districts of Kazarun, Rishahr, Siniz in Fars), and not as a textile plant for the most part, but as a source of lamp-oil.9 Hemp was culti

Other cotton-producing regions are given in other sources, in particular the Herat region (Saifi, p. i n ) . 7 As is well-known, medieval geographers in Moslem countries distinguished land according to its height, between " c o l d " (Arabic surud, Persian sardsir, more than 1,0001,200 m above sea-level) and " h o t " (Arabic jurum, Persian garmslr, less than 1,0001,200 m above sea-level) districts. The coasts of the Caspian Sea and of the Persian Gulf belonged to the garmslr, as did the province of Khuzistan. Sardsir were the Iranian uplands, excepting the various depressions (Sistan, the Balkh oasis, etc.). In conformity with this idea cultivated plants were divided into garmslr = subtropical, and sardsir = all the rest. 8 Faldha, pp. 93-4. 9 Nu^hat al-qulub, pp. 126, 130-1.

vated not so much as a textile, but rather for the production of a wellknown narcotic (Arabic hashish, Persian bang); evidently the distribution of hemp was not widespread, judging by the fact that Hamd Allah Qazvïnï and Hafiz-i Abrü do not mention it in their geographical works. The same can be said of the castor-oil plant (ricinus communis) and of safflower {carthamus tinetortus). Saffron was made from the plant called in Arabic %a'far՝dn which yielded a yellow-orange dye (Burüjird, Rüdhràvar, Qum, Hamadàn, Kühistàn).1 Other dye-yielding plants were madder, which gave a red dye (Khwàf in Khurasan,2 and other regions), henna, which gave an orange dye and was used for cosmetic and medicinal purposes,3 and indigo, which yielded a blue dye and had been cultivated in Persia from the sixth century but was.only commonly met with in Kirman.4 Hamd Allah Qazvïnï does not mention it in the fourteenth century, but the author of the Faldha says that the cultivation of indigo had ceased in Iran, and that it was imported from India, despite the fact that Ghazan had attempted to revive its cultivation.5 Cultivation of the opium poppy, known in Iran from the end of the eleventh or twelfth centuries, was insignificant, to judge from the rarity of refer ences to it in the sources. Sesame occupied the leading position amongst the oil-plants, and sesame oil had practically replaced olive oil. The melon was grown everywhere in Iran, in the words of the author of Fa/dha9 " i n every garden",6 and there were many varieties of it. In the garden of one " refuge of a naqlbat (naqdbat pandh)i.e. of an elder (naqlb) of the Sayyids, a religious fief-holder, the Herat soil grew fifty kinds of melon.7 Hamd Allah Qazvïnï names ten regions (amongst others, Isfahan, Tabriz and Marv) producing the best melons which were exported.8 The pumpkin was also grown throughout Iran,9 as were cucumbers (particularly in Gïlàn, Màzandaràn, Shïràz, Isfahan).10 The water-melon is however rarely spoken of; Hamd Allah Qazvïnï only mentions it as growing in Q a z v i n . 1 1 Vegetable-growing was less developed in the period under con sideration than fruit-growing; vegetables were to be found for the most

part near to the large commercial cities, such as Isfahan.1 The Faldha describes in detail the vegetables and spices which were cultivated in Iran at the beginning of the fourteenth century; the most common of them were cabbages, carrots, onions, garlic, rue, mangel-wurzels and also leguminous plants. As at an earlier date, fruit-growing occupied an outstanding position in the economy of Iran under the Mongols. Hamd Allah Qazvïnï enumerates more than eighty regions of Iran where fruit-growing was widespread and produced abundant crops. Among them was for example Sïstàn where horticulture has almost disappeared nowadays. The fig-palm occupied the foremost position amongst the garmstr plants, and was cultivated in Gurgan and Màzandaràn, as well as Khuzistàn, Fars, Kirman and Sïstàn. The citrus fruits—the lemon, orange, and bitter orange—were grown in the southern and Caspian regions. The coconut-palm only grew in the regions of Hurmuz and Wàsit,2 whilst the olive grew only in Khuzistàn and near to the Caspian in small quantities. The sugar-cane was cultivated in Khüzistan, Kirman and Balkh, and its export and cultivation had greatly declined in comparison with the previous centuries. According to the author of the Faldha the sugar produced in his time was poor in quality and reddish in colour, and Iranian craftsmen were unable to make refined sugar (gand)? The peach, apricot, plum, pear, apple (of which there were more than nowadays), pomegranate, mulberry tree, walnut, almond, pistachio (wild in eastern districts only) were the commonest sardsïr plants. The fig was also widely distributed, both the garmsir and the sardsïr varieties.4 The remaining sardsïr fruits were less widespread. In particular it was not the custom to grow the black and red cherry, the filbert and chestnut, in the garden; but the hazel-nut and the other fruits and nuts just mentioned were plentiful in the wild.5 Viticulture was also highly developed. Hamd Allah Qazvïnï and other authors name about seventy regions in which the best vines were cultivated. There were many varieties. In one district alone, Püshang (Khurasan) a hundred kinds of vine were being grown.6 In the horticultural enterprise of the naqib near Herat, which we mentioned, exactly a hundred varieties of vine were under cultivation.7 Apparently after Ghazan's reforms viticulture did not

achieve the level it had attained around the beginning of the thirteenth century. Thus Ibn Funduq, writing about 1168, informs us of the abund ance of vines in the regions of Baihaq and Nishapur, but Hamd Allah Qazvini says nothing of Nishapur grapes, and states that few grapes were grown in Baihaq.1 Dried fruit and grapes were exported from a number of regions (Isfahan, etc.) to such distant countries as Asia Minor (Rum), India and China(via Basra).2 Wine-making and the drinking of wine were very widespread, despite the Islamic prohibition. Datepalm brandy and other alcoholic drinks were produced and consumed.3 The cultivation of flowers and scented plants (mashmumdf) had also been preserved in Iran—in Fars and Mazandaran4—and they were used in the production of perfumes, cosmetics, medicaments, aromatic essences (flower-waters), and flower-oils, especially the renowned rose-oil, etc.5 Unlike other branches of agriculture silk-growing (i.e. the culture of the silk-worm) not only showed no sign of decline in the second half of the thirteenth and the fourteenth century, but showed progress. If in the tenth century the main areas of silk-production were the Marv oasis, Gurgan, Mazandaran, and the Bardaca valley in Arran and Shirvan, and the silk-weavers of, say, Khuzistan worked the raw imported silk of Barda'a, in the period under consideration silkweaving existed also in the Yazd oasis, in Fars (in the region of Bishapur), Kuhistan (Turshiz, Gunabad), Khurasan (Khwaf and Zaveh) and Gilan,6 as well as the areas previously mentioned. A t the beginning of the thirteenth century Gilan silk was still considered to be of poor quality,7 but by the end of the thirteenth century its quality had so improved that merchants came from Genoa to buy it.8 Italian sources of the thirteenth-fourteenth centuries—the commercial records of the Florentines Pegolotti and Uzziano, the statutes of Pisa, etc., utilized by W. Heyd in his book—know of the following sorts of raw silk imported from Iran for manufacture in the towns of Italy: setaghella—Gilan silk;

seta masandroni—Amul silk from Māzandarān; seta stravatina or seta strāvai—Astrabad silk from Gurgān; seta talani—Daiļam (?) silk; seta mardacascia—silk from Marv-i Shāhijān, etc.1 According to the author of the Falāha a special kind of mulberry tree (white mulberry) was used for the culture of the silkworm. It did not have much fruit, but many leaves, " f o r one diram of pupae (tukhm֊i kirm) eats 500 mans of leaves and gives one man of silk".2 The organiza tion of silk-production was best managed in the Yazd oasis. There one mulberry tree yielded 500 mans of leaves and one man of raw silk, as much as was yielded in other regions by 4-5 dirams of silkworm.3 The culture of cochineal still had some importance—although incom parably less than that of silk—and was used in the manufacture of red dye which was then exported to a number of countries. Cochineal was collected near Marand in Āzarbāījān,4 and to the south of Ararat.5 In general an impression is created that irrigation (in particular the construction of karītŗes and channels, and the building of dams)6 and agricultural engineering were kept up in Iran after the Mongol con quest. But there was no noticeable progress in the application of the tools of labour. This is most readily explained by the dominant form of feudal exploitation of the peasantry (the quit-rent system) and the high rates of feudal rent, as a consequence of which the introduction of improvements in tools (the same that have survived into the twen tieth century) was advantageous neither to the peasant nor to the land owner.
THE TOWN IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY
From what has been said previously, it is evident to what extent the towns had suffered after the Mongol conquest—in particular the large cities such as Marv, Balķh, Herat, Nīshāpūr, Ray, Qazvln and so on. Some of the shattered and ravaged cities were restored, as was Herat in 1236, but they were now much smaller. In 639 or 1241/2 there were 6,900 people in Herat.7 But Herat was again sacked several times, as we have already seen, and only became a large city again under the

Tīmūrids. According to the well-informed Rashīd al-Dīn, on the eve of Ghazan's reforms five out of every ten houses in the sacked cities of Iran were uninhabited.1 In Nakhchivān as late as the reign of Sultan Uvais five out of six houses were empty, the occupants having gone to live elsewhere.2 The heavy tax on crafts and trade, which had not existed under the pre-Mongol rulers,3 hampered the rivival of town-life. If we take into consideration the remarks of Hamd Allāh Qazvmi that many towns were still ruined and that others had become villages we can make the deduction that in general urban life had suffered a decline in Iran during the Mongol period. But this decline did not affect all towns. Some towns and cities revived after the reforms of Ghazan and made considerable economic progress. This depended not only on the fact that there were towns which had not been destroyed during the conquest (Tabriz for example avoided destruction by paying the conquerors), but also on the economic nature of the town. In medieval Iran towns could be divided into several economic types. First of all there were many small and medium-sized towns occupied in commerce and craft-industry serving a limited local market. Other towns of a moderate size were centres of craft-industry producing exports for the international market such as Kāzarūn—the centre of flax-spinning, Yazd—weaving silk—and Kāshān—the centre of the ceramics industry—which also weaved silk and made carpets. There were city-emporiums lying on international caravan and shipping routes, which were storing places, points for trans-shipping, and exchanges for the export and transit trades, such as Tabriz, Marāgheh, Hamadān, Qazvin, Isfahan, Shīrāz, Nīshāpūr, etc. Hurmuz, transferred from the coast to a bare little island in the Persian Gulf, flourished entirely thanks to the transit of Iranian, Arabic, Western European, Indian and Chinese goods. Frequently such towns were also centres of craft-industry serving the international market, as Isfahan (cotton and silk-weaving) and Shīrāz (iron goods, wool-weaving, the production of rose and other flower oils and aromatic essences).4 There is no

8 Naşir ad-dīn Tüsî, p. 761. Tamgha was collected on each business transaction, even in the case of prostitution and the sale of wine. The exact size of the tamgha is not known, but from one of the letters of Raşhid al-Dīn (no. 13, see below) it is possible to conclude that until the time of Ghazan it was paid at the rate of 10 per cent of the value of each deal. The tamgha was retained in Iran, but at a reduced rate, until the reign of Tahmāsp I. 4 Rose water and other aromatic liquids were even exported to China from Fārs in the twelfth-thirteenth centuries; see Chau Ju-Kua, p. 134.

doubt that the great city-emporiums by far surpassed the greatest cities of Western Europe of the late medieval period, such as Venice, Milan, Florence or Paris, in the scale of their economic activities and their populations (at least before the Mongol invasion). Thus we should pay a certain respect to the figures given in the sources for the populations of the giant cities of the pre-Mongol period.1 In general we do not possess reliable statistical information for the Mongol period as regards population, but we do have some figures for the fifteenth century. Clavijo fixes the population of Tabriz in 1403 at 200,000 households.2 An anonymous historian of Shah Isma'Il, more modestly, and probably more correctly, gives the figure as from 200,000 to 300,000 people. The Mongols are supposed to have slaughtered about 800,000 people in Baghdad in 1258, whilst Tlmur is said to have killed 90,000 in 1401. Josapha Barbaro gives the population of Isfahan3 as a mere 5 0,000 in the second half of the fifteenth century. That of Kashan he gives as 20,000 households ( = families, i.e. approx. 90,000 people), and that of Shiraz as 200,000 households (about 900,000 people), which is probably a great exaggeration.4 Such towns were able to recover quickly after the Mongol conquest and even to prosper because of income from exports and the transit trade, despite high rates of taxation (tamgha). This prosperity however came to a rapid end and such towns were deserted when the trade routes altered, as happened in the case of the south Iranian port of Siraf, the importance of which passed to Hurmuz. Towns living off the transit trade had comparatively little influence on the economic development of Iran as a whole, although of course they influenced the economies of the suburban regions. It is in part possible to assess the development of such towns, as well as the market character of their suburban agriculture, from their tax-returns. Regrettably Hamd Allah Qazvini rarely gave figures for tax {tamghd) paid by cities separately from that paid by the cities and their surrounding districts (see p. 508).
The residences of the Il-Khans represented a peculiar type of town or city. Such were Maragheh, Tabriz, Ujan, and the bazaar-cities that had arisen around the Il-Khanid headquarters (prdu)—the summer camps
1 See above, pp. 485-6. 2 That is "families". Persian khdna, lit. house, signified " f a m i l y " ordinarily. Assuming that the average family consisted of 4-5 persons, we obtain 900,000 inhabitants of Tabriz. This is an evident exaggeration. 3 Isfahan was sacked twice after the Mongols had pillaged it (1237), by Tlmur and during the reign of Jahan-Shah. 4 Barbaro, pp. 72-4.

It is worthy of note that, whereas the Arab geographers of the ninth and tenth centuries and an anonymous Persian at the end of the tenth century give detailed information concerning articles produced by craftsmen and their export from the towns of Iran, Hamd Alláh Qazvini and Háfiz-i Abrü say almost nothing about the economic life of the towns, although they dwell upon the agricultural production of various regions in some detail. In this it is impossible not to see reflected the decline of the towns. Essentially we know very little about the economy of the towns and life in them during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Nevertheless objets d'art in museums and various collections witness to the fact that Iranian craftsmanship remained at a high level.3 In the correspondence of Rashid al-Din the following articles of export from various towns are mentioned: Tabriz—monochrome woven silks (kïmkhd), cloth of camel-hair, variously coloured velvets {qatïfa-yi alvári), shagreen and leather footwear, fur and fur goods; Shïraz—cotton cloths (karbds) and printed cotton goods, linen (qadaq of Kazarün), leather footwear; Isfahan—cotton cloths valad, dbydrt, shamsiyya, etc.; Kazarüncotton cloths; Káshán—woven silks; Herat—kimkhd and other silken cloths.4

(Ala-Tagh, Sultaniyeh) and the winter ones (Mahmudabad). According to Hamd Allah Qazvini the tamgha paid in Sultaniyeh rose from 200,000 to 300,000 dinars when the khan had his residence (ordu) there. The satisfaction of the requirements of the Court and trade with the nearby summer camps (yailaq) of the Mongols gave both wages and income to the motley population of craftsmen and traders gathered in Sultaniyeh.1 Ibn Battuta calls Maragheh a little Damascus.2

THE TOWN IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY
The towns of the pre-Mongol period and after had no overall selfgovernment such as that given by statute to the city communes of the eleventh-sixteenth centuries and the German imperial cities in western Europe. There was however self-administration within the limits of the quarter (mahalla\ the householders of the quarter, gathering in the mosque, elected their mayor, discussed their business) and the guild or corporation—either merchant, craft, or religious. The corporations of the Sayyids and their elders—naqïb—in particular were very in fluential; there were about 1,400 Sayyids in the Shirâz corporation.1 The influence of the Sufi-dervish shaikhs was also enormous. At the beginning of the thirties of the thirteenth century the majority of the population in Balkh were murids of Shaikh Bahâ' al-Dïn Valad, the father of Jalàl al-Din Rûmï.2 A century later the inhabitants of Ardabil were thought to be mostly murids of Shaikh Safi al-Dïn Ishâq, the ancestor of the Safavid dynasty.3 In the towns the power of the local feudal landowner, known generally under the title of malik, was inter woven with the power of the khan's vicegerent (Mongol basqaq, Persian shahnd) who controlled the activities of the malik, collected taxes and was endowed with military might.4 The town nobility as previously had great influence in the towns forming a kind of patriciate. These were landowners or feudalists of the surrounding area who before the Saljuq conquest had lived in their castles, but who now lived more often in the towns than upon their estates. The characteristic peculiarity of this nobility was its close connexion with the great commercial companies and with big whole sale and transit trade. They invested a part of their income in the companies of the great wholesale merchants, called usually urtaq (Turkish ortaq—"partner in a share", investor), "the Emperor's own merchants " (tujjâr-i khdss), or " trustworthy merchants " {tujjâr֊i amïn), who returned the feudal lords their share of the profit in goods, mostly textiles. Thus the above-mentioned vizier, the historian Rashid al-Din, himself a great feudal landowner,5 invested a major part of his fortune, 32,500,000 dinars out of 35,000,000, in a large wholesale undertaking ; "the greater part of the money I gave to trustworthy merchants {tujjâr֊iamïny\ writes Rashid al-Din in his will, " and they conduct their trade with this money, and I have written down their names in my

account b o o k " . 1 In his letters Rashid al-Din gives huge lists of goods, mostly textiles, and partly leather and fur goods, etc, which he had received from the merchants.2 Such a rapprochement of some groups of feudalists with the large-scale merchants is a phenomenon typical of medieval Iran, as also of other lands of the Near and Middle East. Thus in contrast to Western Europe from the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries the merchants did not oppose the great feudal landowners, but made common cause with them against the craftsmen, the lower classes of the towns and the local peasantry.3 The town authorities—refis (mayor), qddi (the religious judge and head of the religious estate in the area), khatib (the imam of the mosque meeting), muhtasib (the censor of morals supervising bazaars, social life, and morals of the citizens), and others—came from the local patriciate. Often they inherited their positions. As did the family of the Qâdiyàn in Shiraz, the Mustaufiyân in Qazvin4 and the Juvainïyàn in Khurasan.5 The writer of these lines analysed the information given by Hamd Allah Qazvini concerning the aristocratic families of his native town of Qazvin in order to give an idea of the nature of the urban nobility of his time.6 It appears that despite the fact that on 7 Sha'ban 717/7 October 1220 the Mongols had carried out a "whole sale massacre",7 many of the local noble families survived or were spared. O f the 28 families mentioned by the author 25 had settled in Qazvin long before the Mongol conquest,8 and only three (one of Mongol, one of Turkish, and one of Persian origin) again distinguished themselves in the service of the Mongol Il-Khàns. These families possessed estates in the district of Qazvin and carried out state and religious duties.9

Noble families owned large estates with servants and slaves, sub urban gardens, and sometimes whole quarters, in the towns. The enor mous quarter or rather suburb rebuilt by Rashid al-Din in Tabriz, belonging to him by right of unconditional ownership {mulk), is described not without boasting in his letter to his son Sacd al-Din, the governor of Qinnisrin and 'Awasim.1 In this quarter (Rub'-i Rashidi) he claims that there were 30,000 homes ( = families),2 24 caravansarais, 1,500 shops, bath-houses, gardens, mills, workshops for weaving {sha'r-bdfi) and papermaking {kdghadh-sd^i), a dye-works {rangra^-khdna), a mint {ddr al-darb), etc. Rashid al-Din brought tradesmen {sanai va muhtarafd) from a variety of towns to his suburb, and asked his son to send 50 wool-weavers {suf-bdfdn) from Antioch and Cilicia, and 20 from Cyprus. Four-hundred theologians and lawyers were settled here in the " quarter of the learned" {kucha-ji culamd՝), and there were 1,000 students {tdlib֊i Him)? Fifty of the best doctors of Syria, Egypt, India, and China (oculists, surgeons, bonesetters) worked in the hospital {ddr al-shifd), and so on. In Hamadan Rashid al-Din had his own quarter with 1,500 houses. Nobles, mosques, theological academies or madrasas, and religious bodies owned by right of mulk or vaqf caravansarais, bazaars, and shops, which they leased for rent and from which they derived income. In medieval Iran there were four fundamental centres of social life in a town: the shahristdn and the quarters of the patriciate; the madrasas, the khdnqdhs of the dervishes, and other religious institutions together with religious corporations and dervish brotherhoods; the bazaar centre (Persian chdrsu, Arabic murabbaca), together with the caravansarais, big merchants, and wholesale trade; and the quarters of the craftsmen, and their corporations (Arabic sinf, plural asndf), the lesser bazaars with their petty retail trade. Wares were sold by craftsmen in the workshops, the latter also serving as shops {dukkdn in Arabic). Most often but not always craftsmen of one and the same trade lived in the same quarter; in every town there were quarters occupied by silkweavers, cotton-carders, shoemakers, saddlemakers, dyers, potters, etc. The sources are meagre concerning the craftsmens' corporations.4 Ibn Battuta mentions them, saying that the Isfahan craftsmen elected

In the sources rank is mentioned: ustdd "'master", khalifa "apprentice",2 and shagird " p u p i l " , appren tice. The craft guilds in the towns of Iran were much weaker than the guilds of western Europe. They could not obtain a corporative monopoly nor could they fix the price of their products to their greatest satisfaction, as was the case in western Europe. A connexion is trace able between the craft guilds and the dervish brotherhoods.3 In literature there is more than one mention of the connexion between the corporations and the movement of the futmvwa—the unions of the akhis.4 The akhis are also mentioned in the towns of the fourteenth century,5 but there is no information concerning a connexion between them and the guilds. There were also corporations of declasse indigent elements Najjardnf and guilds of beggars (sdsdniydn or sdsiydn)? Corporate craftsmen were freemen although they had to give part of their produce to the treasury or to the local landowner, and take part without recompense in the construction of public buildings and in the decoration of the city for festivals organized by the authorities. But there were also unfree craftsmen working in the towns of Iran and Central Asia under the Mongols. At the time of the Mongol invasion many craftsmen were turned into slaves; some of them (for example
1 Ibn Battiita, vol. n, p. 45. 2 Ethnological investigation of Central Asian craft guilds show that there were thought to be two ranks in the corporations—apprentice (shagird) and master {ustdd); khalifa was the title of a person who had qualified as a master but who did not have the means to start his own dukkan and who worked for another craftsman. When a khalifa was able to start his own workshop he required no new initiation. The initiation of a master necessitated a threefold act: the reading of the first sura of the Qur'an, the tying on of a belt (kamarhandi), and a ritual feast, called arvdh-i pir. See, for example, E. M. Peshchereva, Goncharnoe proi^yodstvo v Srednei A^ii (Moscow, 1959), pp. 313-72. The Persian guilds are first mentioned in the Georgian hagiographic source of the sixth century —The Life of St Eustaphius of Mtskheta.
3 Aflaki, translated by Huart, p. 117, says that during the lifetime of Jalal al-Dln Ruml the greater part of the dervishes of the Maulavi order consisted of craftsmen and poor people; the life of SafI al-DIn also mentions many murid craftsmen of the Shaikh Safi al-DIn (Sof vat al-safd, passim).

the silkweavers of Herat) were taken to Mongolia, some remained in Iran and worked in special large workshops (kdr-khdna) belonging to the treasury, or the Il-Khanid family, and so on. Rashid al-Dln mentions kar-khanas in Khabushan, Nishapur, Tus, Isfara'in, Tabriz;1 Vassaf speaks of kar-khanas and craftsmen belonging to individual Chingizids in Bukhara and Samarqand;2 whilst Saifi mentions a kar-khana in Herat.3 It is evident from a decree of Ghazan that craftsmen working in such large workshops—saddlers, tanners, armourers, etc.—were slaves (asiran), and received no wages in money. Payment was in kind, but most of this payment was stolen by officials running the workshops. The whole product of the enslaved craftsmen went to the Divan. Since such labour was not very productive, Ghazan put the craftsmen on a fixed tax, after paying which the slaves could work for themselves.4 A general phenomenon of the Iranian economy during the Il-Khan period was the decline of commodity economy (which remained in the areas near the main caravan routes and the large towns) and the growth of natural economy. Taxes from agricultural districts were mostly paid in kind—primarily in grain.5 And although the geo graphical work of Hamd Allah Qazvini shows taxes in money, it is evident from a list of taxes from Khuzistan quoted by Rashid al-Din in a letter to his son Shihab al-Din, ruler of Khuzistan, that the basic taxthe land tax—was paid in kind, in the form of grain and as a share of the crop.6 The wages (mavajib) and pensions (marsumdt) of the military caste, theologians, shaikhs and others were mostly paid in kind—in the form of wheat, barley, rice, cattle, etc.7 In one of his letters Rashid al-Din gives a list of fruits which his estates were to supply him with for the winter. The estates, lying in different parts of the country, had to send 50,000 mans of grapes, 62,000 mans of pomegranates, 37,000 mans of apples, 5,900 mans of raisins, 4,500 mans of fine raisins (kishmish), 9,000 mans of pears, 7,000 mans of quince, 100,000 mans of dates, 200,000 oranges, 20,000 lemons and other fruits and fruit-juices.8 The fact that Rashid al-Din did not buy this mass of fruit on the spot at his

FEUDAL RELATIONSHIPS. THE CATEGORIES
OF LANDOWNERS HIP
The Mongol conquest had a great and in general evil influence on the economic development of Iran; it had much less influence on the social structure of the country. The most typical features of specifically Iranian feudalism antedating the conquest survived it also. Such were the outstanding importance of irrigation ; the coexistence of settled agriculture and nomadic and semi-nomadic cattle-breeding ; the absence of demesne and corvée in the villages; the combination of large-scale feudal landownership with small-scale peasant tenants ; the predomin ance of product rent (money and labour rent had only secondary importance) ; the growth of the military fief system ; the close con nexion between the big merchants and the caravan trade and a group of feudal lords, and even their coalescence ; the absence of selfgoverning towns, so typical of western Europe in the Middle Ages; and the widespread use of slave labour in the crafts and agriculture (irrigation and market gardening) alongside the exploitation of the labour of dependent peasants. Rashid al-Din employed 1,000 (500 men and 500 women) and 200 (100 men and 100 women) enslaved prisoners {astrati va ghulàmàrì) respectively in the great gardens Fathabad and Rashìdàbàd near Tabriz—Georgians, negroes, Abyssinians, Greeks and Kurds ( ?), who " showed zeal in the planting of the vine and of fruit trees, in the digging of channels underground (qanavdt) and on the surface (anhdr), in the watering and gathering of fruit".1 The governing class of feudal lords consisted of four main groups : (1) the military aristocracy of the nomad tribes—Mongol, Turkish, Kurd, etc. ; (2) the settled local provincial nobility, not connected by service with the central government ; (3) the civil service ; (4) the Muslim religious caste, more exactly the theologians. The last three groups were primarily composed of Iranians. These feudal groups, who struggled with one another to control the State, expressed two parallel political tendencies in Iranian society—that of feudal disintegration together with a system of military fiefs, and that of a centralized feudal state

THE CATEGORIES OF LANDOWNERS HIP
together with a ramifying bureaucratic apparatus. Opposed to this classof exploiters was the principal exploited class—the settled peasantry. The nomads were also exploited by their nomad feudal lords, but on a much smaller scale. The nomad feudalists exploited not only the nomads subject to them, but also the settled peasants who dwelt on their fiefs. Along with the class division there existed that of estates:1 "people of the s w o r d " (ahl-i shamshir—the first two groups mentioned), "people of the p e n " (ahl֊i qalam—the last two groups of feudalists mentioned), and the taxable estate or the ra'iyyat (Arabic ra'dyd, plural of ra'iyyat, literally " h e r d " or "flock")—the peasants and townspeople. This latter division of the population, not reflected in Muslim law, was evidently a survival from the Sassanian period, when society was divided into soldiers, priests, clerks, and the taxable people, composed of peasants, craftsmen and merchants. The old categories of feudal landownership long recognized by Muslim law (to be more explicit, conditional and unconditional ownership of land and water, i.e. irrigation works) continued to exist under the Il-Khans: (i) State lands (Arabo-Persian arddi-yi divdni); (2) the private demesne of the Il-Khan and the members of his family (Arabic khdssa, Mong. synonym inju); (3) the lands of the religious and charitable institutions {arddi-yi vaqfi); (4) the lands of private persons belonging to them by unconditional right, Arabic mulk, milk, AraboPersian arddi-yi mdliki, arbdbi), corresponding to the western European allodium. A peculiarity of State ownership of land was that the State itself exploited its tenants—the village communes (jamdcat~i dih)—by means of finance officials ('ummdl). In this case the notions of rent and tax coincided, and the rents or taxes (the land-tax, etc.), paid in cash and kind to the State by the tenants, were then distributed amongst the military caste as wages, pensions, subsidies, gifts, etc. The abundance of state-owned lands was a characteristic of Asiatic feudalism. In the time of the caliphate such land was absolutely predominant in Arab 'Iraq, in Egypt, and possibly in certain areas of Iran, but by no means in all. In Fars for example privately-owned lands {mulk) prevailed until the tenth century.2 After the Mongol conquest the area of the Divan lands greatly increased at first as a result of confiscations or the exter

mination of the previous owners. But afterwards under the Il-Khâns the greater part of these lands were converted into private property, un conditionally (mulk) or conditionally (/^Af*),1 by means of payment, sale,2 or seizure. If the income of the Divân lands was spent on the upkeep of the State apparatus and the army, the income from khâssa properties (injü) was spent on the upkeep of the Il-Khân, of his legal wives (khatun), of his sons, and of their residences (ordu). These lands were under the control of a special ministry—the divdn-i injü. Often injü and state-owned lands were leased.3 Lands belonging to the ruling house (injü) were distinguished from lands belonging to the Il-Khan himself (ınjü-ji khdşş^ mulk֊i pâdşhâh)* Rent coincided with tax in these lands also. By the term injü was understood not only the land, but also the people living on the land, both peasants and landowners, who were personally dependent on the Il-Khan, his wives or sons, on the basis of commendation (Arabic iltijd) and patronage (Arabic iljd, himdyaf)? The injü land fund was composed of lands confiscated from the Iranian nobility after the Mongol conquest and of lands granted to members of the Il-Khanid family by the previous owners.6 This fund was extremely large. The lands of Ghazan himself amounted to 20,000 fadddns (plough-strips),7 that is to 120,000-140,000 hectares of irrigated land. The injü land of Fars district was leased for four years in 682/ 1292-3 for the sum of 10,000,000 dinars, i.e. for 2,500,000 dinars a year. If we consider that State taxes from Fars (from divân and mulk land) were 2,871,200 dinars,8 we can conclude that the injü lands of Fars gave a slightly smaller income than all the remaining lands. According to the Risd/a-ji Fa/akiyya, the overall income from the lands of the khâşşa (injü) amounted to 12,434,220i dinars per annum.9 A certain kind of land mentioned in the sources was called khdlişdt (" clean lands ", i.e. those free of taxes payable to the divân). Nowadays in Iran the term signifies precisely lands belonging to the Divân or the State. But in the period under consideration, as is obvious from the

explanations of Vaşşâf and Raşhld al-Din,1 this name was given to ruined and deserted land (khardb u bd'ir) which was leased to landowner tenants {tarn pi. tunnd* in both authors) under a decree of Ghazan,2 on condition that it was restored and occupied again, and that part of the kharâj was paid in the form of a share of the crop (muqdsamd). Conditions of ownership were favourable to the tenants. These lands formed a separate part of the ruler's lands (khdşşa-ji pddşhdhı) under the administration of a special dîvân-i khdlisdt which made contracts with landowner tenants. The character of the vaqj as an institution, and therefore of vaqf landowning also, suffered no change under the Il-Khans. Inasmuch as the expenditure of vaqf income was limited by conditions laid down by legators, vaqf land may be regarded as a conditional form of feudal landowning. The income of owners of vaqf land did not only come from the exploitation of land and peasants, but also from canals, bazaars, shops, bathhouses, mills and other items of income which were leased for a money rent (Arabic i/'dra). Owners of vaqf land paid nothing to the Divân, since they had tax immunity. The vaqf constituted the main source of income for dervish shaikhs and theologians. A whole body of religious persons and their servants lived on the income of each large vaqf, receiving from its curator {mutavallî) pensions (marsümdt) partly in money but mainly in kind (bread or grain, rice, meat, soap, cloths, etc.), as is shown by the list of expenditure of the vaqf set up by Ghazan in Baghdad.3 After the Mongol conquest many vaqf estates were seized by the " despoilers " (Arabic mutaghallibd)—the Mongols. But under the Muslim Il-Khâns vaqf landownership expanded and formed a large part of the land fund. By mulk, milk, or arbdbl is meant a feudal institution completely analogous to the western European allodium: the full ownership by the landowner (malik) of land and water (channel or kdri^), unconditional and without obligation of service to the State, free to be sold and bequeathed. Mulk or milk denoted small-scale peasant landownership as well, providing the land did not belong to the commune. Mulk land as a rule paid land tax to the divân but mostly paid a tenth (Arabic 'ushr, Persian dah-jak) and not the kharâj. It is evident from the corre spondence of Raşhid al-Din that the arbabi regions of Isfahan and

Khûzistân were obliged to pay a tenth part of the harvest Çuşhf) in kind {bi-jins).1 But there were also " f r e e " mulks (mulk-i hum) with fiscal immunity.2 Military fiefs were formally accounted a part of the State landsiqtac. But in fact they were a form of conditional private property, equivalent to the Western fiefs, with fiscal immunity and the transfer to the fief-holder (Arabic muqta\ Arabo-Persian iqta'-dar) of the right to collect the taxes for himself. Thus tax was the same as rent on these lands and the land tax and other taxes benefited the iqtâ'-dâr. The feudal institution of the iqtac had evolved from the tenth century, from the time of the Umayyads, up to the time of the Saljuqs. It changed from a peculiar kind of free benefice (a grant by the State to a member of the military caste of the right to collect for himself the kharâj, the cuşhr, the jizya from a certain fixed territory great or small for the period of service or for life; in which case the taxes became rent) into a military fief or grant of land with the people on it, which was already usually heredi tary in the tenth century.3 Under the Saljuqs the hereditary iqtac had become the general rule, but this practice apparently only became established in law under Ghazan. From the time of the Saljuqs the iqta' became the specific form of domination by the Turkish, and, from the thirteenth century, by the Mongol-Turkish nomad military aristo cracy, of the Iranian farmers settled on the iqta' lands.4 Under the Saljuqs iqta' land was very common in Iran.5 Under the first six Il-Khans also iqtâc land was granted to the military,6 but not to all soldiers, the grants being mainly to the higher ranks. The mass of ranker soldiers, mostly nomads, received only wages in kind (grain), and some money under the name of jâmagu Under Ghazan iqta* fiefs were given to all Mongols who were warriors of the general levy, and according to Raşhîd al-Dln whole regions became iqta' "in every vilâyat".

Shirvan and Khurasan,1 which is completely explained by the fact that the main summer (jailaq) and winter (qi'shlaq) camps of the Mongol and Turkish tribes forming the backbone of the Il-Khanid army were there. Cultivated land with settled peasants near to nomad camps was given as iqta'. Ghazan's decree of the year 703/1303, dealing with the apportion i n g of iqta' land amongst the Mongol levy, was formally an act of beneficence on the part of the Il-Khan, but was in fact made necessary by the pressing importunity of the army, about which Rashid al-Dln speaks. This explains the publication of this decree, which was in contradiction to the general centralizing policy of Ghazan and stimu lated thereafter the growth of feudal distintegration. According to the decree, a certain fixed area was granted in fief to the amir of a thousand, i.e. to the leader of a branch of the Mongol tribe who provided the army with a thousand horsemen. The amir of a thousand divided this amongst the amirs of hundreds by sortition (casting lots with a whip). In the same way amirs of hundreds divided land amongst amirs of tens, and these did likewise amongst the rankers. All of the soldiers received a large portion by right of iqtac—a village or part of a village—and the amirs received correspondingly more. The ownership of iqtac was conditional upon doing military service; the iqtac could be taken back upon execution of poor service. In accordance with the decree iqtac lands were to be inherited, but not necessarily by the son, but by whomsoever of the family could best carry out military service. The sense of the decree indicates that taxes which were previously paid to the divan could now be collected as a right by the landowner himself (apart from a small tax of 50 mans of grain). Thus the possessor of iqta' land had fiscal immunity but not administrative immunity. The inspector of the divan of the army—bttikchi-yi 'arid—was re quired every year to carry out an inspection of iqtac lands and to take back the fiefs of those who had failed to do their military service or did not care to cultivate their land.2 The decree gives the rights of fief-holder in respect of peasants living on the iqtac lands.3 This decree firmly established the caste-hierarchical system of military fiefs. Jalayirid charters (of Sultan Uvais) granting iqta' to an amir of a tiimen? an amir of a thousand, and a lower rank, possibly an amir of a

hundred,1 have come down to us. In these decrees there is also talk of the granting of a whole district to the complete control {tasarruf) of a grantee. The terms jâmagî and iqtâ<՝ are here used as synonyms. Along with a clearly expressed fiscal immunity the iqta'-dar also received the right of administrative immunity, with a prohibition against officials of the Divân entering upon immune territory, set apart {mafru%) from the vilâyat and not subordinate to local authority.2 Thus we have here a further evolution of the iqtâc. Apart from the fiefs of the military nobility (Jqta6) there existed conditional grants of land and rent to members of the bureaucracy and the religious bodies. The grant for life of rent in kind (corn, barley, rice) or money was called ma'îşhat (Arabic literally " livelihood") and when granted into heredity {maurütB) or when it was "eternal" {abadı) it was called idrar (literally "pension"). Often such a grant was replaced by the grant of a village of the Divân, the income ( = amount of taxes) from which equalled the sum of the ma'Ishat or the idrar. This kind of grant was called the muqassa and was either for life {muqâşşa-yi ma՝c։shat) or for eternity {muqâşşa-yi idrar)? It is clearly evident from the charters of Sultân Uvais that the owner of muqassa lands not only had fiscal immunity but also administrative immunity. The latter is ex pressed in the formula (which is met with in the charters of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries): " Let them [the officials of the Divân] make brief and remove quills and feet"4(that is, let them not carry on correspond ence nor trespass on immune land). Further development of the iqta* led to the soyurghal (Mong. literally " g r a n t " ) — a military fief which appeared under the Jalayirids, was hereditary, and had fiscal and administrative immunity.5 After the middle of the fourteenth century the term soyurghal had replaced iqta. The latter term is encountered thereafter from time to time in narrative sources as an archaic and bookish expression ordinarily signifying soyurghal. The sources do not bear out the opinion expressed earlier that the soyurghal was introduced into Iran by Timur. Pasture lands can be distinguished as a special category of land. The nomads—Mongol, Turkish, Lur and Arab—utilized it for their summer

camps in high mountainous regions and for their winter camps in the plains, with great distances between. Such pasture was normally designated by the terms yurt (Turkish) or 'alaj-khvdr (Arabo-Persian, literally "pasture").1 The iqta', soyurghal, or yurt could encompass territory great or small and could include the land of landowners lower in rank (e.g. the iqta* land of an amir of a thousand contained the lands of ranks subordinate to him). Both this system and the confusion of the concepts of stateowned land and the feudal estate which we find in the sources were in general typical of feudal societies with their hierarchic disintegrated form of property. A s we have said, private ownership, both conditional (iqtdc) and unconditional (muik), greatly expanded at the expense of state-owner ship under the last Il-Khans.2 A general feature of this process was the concentration of land in the hands of great landowners. There were various ways in which this occurred: the granting of land by the Il-Khans, law-suits (in respect of land the title-deeds of which had been lost),3 purchase (^////fe-land), and often straightforward seizure by the strong. The term mutaghallib, meaning " seizer of land", is often met with in the documents of the period. Already under the first two Il-Khans the powerful Shams al-Dln Muhammad Juvaini, taking advan tage of his position, bought land (wulk) worth 40,000,000 dinars. The greater part of the estates of Rashid al-Dln consisted of mulks which he bought in small pieces scattered about various regions. One supposes that this land was bought in separate lots from small landowners driven by ruin to sell their lands. The historian-minister also possessed deserted and neglected land (gaminhd-yi khardb u bd'ir), which he had taken on the basis of Ghazan's decree granting all such lands to those who would cultivate them.4 Lastly he derived income from vaqf lands of which he was the trustee (mutavalli). From Rashid al-Din's will it is evident that, beside those lands which he had given to his sons earlier, he intended to leave his sons and daughters, friends and trusted servants, 12,770 faddans (ploughstrips) of mulk ploughland, i.e. approx. 75-85,000 hectares of irrigated ploughland, and 39,000 date-palms in Arab "Iraq and the southern

regions of Iran. A s well as this he bequeathed to them an enormous number of gardens (1,200 men and women were slaves in but two of them near Tabriz), vineyards, 30,000 horses, 250,000 rams, 10,000 camels, and so on. Rashid al-Dln had elders of nomad tribes {ahsham) pasture his cattle and used to give his poultry and geese to depen dent peasants {dahdqiri) to be fed.1 The Il-Khan Abu.

A s is well known, Moslem law did not recognize serfdom and a special category of serfs. It knew only of free Muslims, dhimmis {ahlal-dhimma); the heterodox, Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians—who were personally free but had limited civil rights; and finally the slave,3 in principal a heterodox prisoner or the descendant of a heterodox prisoner. The taxable estate {ra'aya)—peasants and townspeople—were formally regarded as personally free. De facto feudal dependence existed as a result of bondage to the soil, in virtue of which the State transferred populated land conditionally {iqta\ vaqf) or unconditionally {muik) to the military caste and to the faqih, together with the right to receive either wholly or in part the kharaj and other taxes, in which case tax became rent. Thus the relationship between the landowner and the peasant had the character not of personal but of territorial dependence. Nizam al-Mulk said that the muqta' had no rights over the person {tan) of the peasant, nor over the members of his family, nor over his plot of land, nor over his household; he had only the right to collect the rent.4 Such was the formal legal position of the peasant. Things were of course different in practice. A s early as the twelfth century the owners of iqtac land exercised legal and police powers over their peasants. The confusion of administrative and State functions with the rights of the landowner was a feature typical of both Western and Eastern feudalism.

THE PEASANTS UNDER THE ÏL-&HANS
The self-government practised from ancient times by the village communes in Iran limited to an extent the arbitrary powers of the landowners and the financial officials in State lands. However, this communal self-government had begun to decay long before the Mongol conquest as a result of the inner stratification of the village commune already noticeable under the last Sassanians—the small landowners, the diqhâns, were then distinguished from the commune—and also as a result of the arbitrary practices of the financial officials and, after the Saljuq period, of the possessors of military fiefs. The village commune is rarely mentioned in the sources of the Mongol period and is usually
called jamâ'at-i dïh> jamaat-i qurây or jamâ'at-i ahâlï֊yi dïhhâ.1 However we did not chance upon any material descriptive of life in the commune in the sources, although we are told here and there of conflicts and law suits between commune and landowner. We completely failed to find any mention of the periodic redistribution of land or about communal crop-rotation; it is evident that both had disappeared about the begin ning of this period. The impression is created that the village commune was in a state of decline under the Mongols. Before the thirteenth century we have no information that the feudal dependence of the peasants had taken the form of serfdom, with pro hibition of travel. The binding of the peasants to the soil occurs apparently only after the Mongol conquest.2 It was provoked primarily by the general economic decline of the country and by the catastrophic curtailment in the number of its inhabitants with the concomitant lack of workers and taxpayers on the land. There was now too much un cultivated and empty land and too few hands. In addition the fiscal policy of the conquerors and unbridled lawlessness on their part drove the peasants to mass flight.3 For these reasons the State and the feudal classes had a stake in prohibiting the right of movement of peasants and their forced return if they should flee. On the other hand the "Great Yasa" of Chingiz-Khan looked upon the dependence of the low-ranking Mongol warrior on his lord as a personal dependence. The Mongol warrior (qaraçhu) was considered a serf and was attached, but of course not to the soil, for this would not make sense amongst nomads, but to

the person of his hereditary lord, the nomad aristocrat. The Mongol conquerors attempted to extend this notion to include the Iranian ra'iyyat. The Yasa prohibited movement to another place under pain of death to "any man from a thousand, hundred, or ten", and forbade the concealing of fugitives.1 And although this law only applied to soldiers of the Mongol levy at first, it produced the feudal attachment of the ra'iyyat, in so far as the Yasa was extended to them2 and in so far as the basis of the Yasa was the principle of universal attachment to the service of the State. The Armenian historian Grigor of Akner relates how tax-payers who had run away from the place of their registration were captured, bound and whipped without mercy.3 The Mongol view of the peasants as the personal property of the lord is recorded in a decree of Ghazan, in which it is clear that the fief-holders are speaking of their peasants: " T h e y are given to us in the iqta', they are our slaves."4 This is a confusion of slaves with the ra'iyyat, previously impossible and inadmissible in Muslim law. The decree of Ghazan concerning the military fiefs or iqtac confirms the previously existing attachment of peasants to the soil. Peasants who had fled from inhabited and deserted villages granted as iqta' were ordered to return to their former habitations, unless thirty years had elapsed from the time of their flight, or unless they were included in the tax lists (qdnuri) of other vilayats. All were forbidden to shelter fugitive ra'iyyat.5 Another decree of Ghazan prohibited the further movement of peasants settled upon land.6 Thus attachment to the soil had spread to all peasants. A t the same time the decrees of Ghazan of the period after his con version to Islam must be regarded as an attempt at judicial compromise between the Yasa of Chingiz-Khan and Muslim law. The right of movement of peasants was denied, but they were treated as free in law. It was emphasized that landowners should not move the peasants from village to village arbitrarily and they were forbidden to call them slaves. The peasants were not attached to the landowner but to the place of registration, to the tax list of a given area. This tendency to compromise between the Mongol Yasa and Muslim law is characteristic of the whole of Ghazan's domestic policy. Of course the formal freedom of peasants was pure fiction in their actual situation without rights.

The attachment of peasants to the soil was also in existence under the Jalayirid sultans. Frequent orders for the search for peasants and their return to their former homes can be found in the documents collected in the Dasfur al-kdtib.1 One document mentions the return of fugitive ra'iyyat of the Hamadan vilayat.2 The reasons for flight given in these documents were the heaviness of the taxes, the arbitrary and illegal exactions of the local authorities, and sometimes the devastation of an area. Quit-rent {mu^ara^d) was the basic form of exploitation of the peasants in Iran both before and after the Mongol invasion. Peasants regarded as free in law depended on the landlord as tenants or subtenants, and in most cases hereditary tenants. The rent they paid was mostly feudal rent, a share of the crop, or in regions near to towns and there only, rent half in kind and half in money. The predominance of quit-rent was due to the fact that the landowners' own demesne was by and large absent from the economy. It is at least true that landlords did not possess, as a rule, their own grain-producing properties. Thus the peasants did not do the corvee. In so far as landowners still worked their own estates (gardens and virgin land—bdqi\ they employed slave prisoners and not peasants.3 The five part division of the harvest between the landlord and the farmer (one part for the land, irrigation, draught animals, seed, and workmen) which exists at the present day is not mentioned in the medieval sources. Then also the share of the landowner (in other words, the feudal rent) varied according to local conditions and depended for its size on whether the tenant received from his land lord land only, or oxen, seed, and the benefits of his irrigation as well. The share of the landlord was designated by the term hissa-ji mdliki, bahra-yi mdlikdna^
In general there was not a clear distinction between this rent and taxes. Both were either paid wholly to the State, as was the case on the land of the Divan where tax and rent were one; or to the Il-Khan and his family, if the land was injii land; or wholly to the landlord on vaqfi, iqta', muqassa, and mulk~i hurr territory; or lastly income from

land would be divided between the State as tax and the landlord as rent in fixed proportion on mulk and khdlisdt land. What was this proportion ? We have but little information on this point. We see from the tax regulations of Khuzistan that the Divan took 60 per cent of the harvest on state-owned land and 10 per cent from arbabi or mulk land in kind.1 Assuming that the same amount was paid by the tenant on the latter land as on the former, we may conjecture that the land owner derived 50 per cent after the State's 10 per cent (dah-jak) had been paid to the divan, and that the peasant kept 40 per cent of his crop. We can suppose that the same applies to the Isfahan vilayat where the divan took 10 per cent.2 O n khalisat land in Arab Iraq however the tenant {tdni) had one-third of the crop, one-third was paid to the divan, and the subtenant farmer (bar^gar) kept one-third for himself.3 Money rent existed in suburban regions near to large towns (money rent on land—ijdra); auxiliary forms of rent were the labour rent and rent in kind. Labour rent signified the forced labour of the ra'iyyat on behalf of the State or their landlords and consisted of irrigation work such as the digging of channels and kariz and their periodic cleansing,4 building work such as the construction of houses, palaces, fortress walls, etc.,5 and the clearing of woodland for the plough in the lands near the Caspian.6 The words used for this labour rent were bigdr, shigdr, and hashar.
The terms akkdr, mu%ari\ and bar^gar meaning "farmer, sower", as the sources show, took on the sense of quit-rent tenant. The econo mic unit was juft-i gdvy literally a "team of o x e n " (synonyms were fadddn, ^aujy and pdgdv). This term had a twofold technical sense: (1) a team of oxen together with light or heavy plough and ploughmen, the team often consisting of several pairs of beasts and sometimes as many as twelve; (2) a strip of land for ploughing which could be worked by one team in one season. The size of thejuft or faddan varied in different

regions but an average would possibly be 6-7 hectares.1 The juft normally included several peasant farms and served as the unit of taxation of the peasants.2 It was a unit for fixing the returns—the inju estates of Ghazan in Fars were leased at 61 dinars and 4 dangs per annum from each faddan3 and also as the unit for the distribution of compulsory labour amongst the peasants.4 The official acts rarely touch upon the condition of the peasants on privately owned estates and give meagre information. This is under standable since the State regarded the relationship between the peasant and his malik as the private affair of the latter; narrative sources rarely mention this subject. On the other hand we possess much information from the most varied sources concerning the condition of the peasants on injii and Divan land, and they all paint a dark picture. Hamd Allah Qazvlnl gives us to understand that the position of the peasant was better on the estates of the private landowners (arbdb), and that they took care to preserve their own property. Managers of Divan and vaqf land, in which there was a rapid turnover, were in a hurry to get rich, and did not worry about the prosperity of their estates, with the result that they ruined them.5 The poet Nlzarl in the seventies of the thirteenth century saw an estate (privately owned) in Kuhistan which had been deserted because of the oppression of a tyrant landlord,6 The same poet gives the following description of the practice of collecting tax in kind (wine) in the same province. The tax collector (muhassil) arrived at the village of Baidan and presented the elder {mihtar-i dih) with an as signation (bardt) on 100 mans of wine. The elder announced that his village was ruined and that he did not have a single man of wine. He was given 200 blows with a stick, which only ceased when the hidden jars of wine were discovered.7 Rashid al-Din, speaking about the mass flight of peasants from their villages, continues: " W h e n the tax collectors went around the locality, they found some villain or other who knew the houses, and at his direction discovered the people in corners, cellars, gardens, and ruins. If they could not find the men, they seized their wives. Driving them before them like a flock of sheep,

they brought them to the tax officials who had them hung up on ropes so that the wails and plaints of the women rose up to the heavens."1 The same author relates that one of the landowners (malldk) arrived at his village in Flruzabad in the region of Yazd to collect the rent and could find neither elder nor peasant: they had all fled. O n the other hand he saw seventeen tax collectors, come with barats to be met from the taxes of the village. They had managed to capture three ra'iyyat who had hidden in the steppe. They brought them back to the village and hung them on ropes to force them to tell where the other peasants were hidden, but they discovered nothing.2 Rashid al-Dln wrote to his son Mahmud, governor of Kirman, about the poverty-stricken condition of the peasants of the province of Bam, ruined and in flight because of the extortion and violence practised by the military.3 Rent and taxes not only devoured a great part of the peasant's crops, but were often more than the peasant could pay, so that arrears (baqdjdy mounted from year to year, and the peasant remained an eternal debtor. Taxfarming did more than a little to ruin the peasants, and this practice, called mtqdta'a or daman, remained in existence after the reign of Ghazan.5 Tax-farmers were mainly nomad aristocrats,6 local landlords, officials or moneylenders attempting to get as much out of the ra'iyyat as pos sible, and not caring if they drove them to total ruin. Rashid al-Dln and Vassaf give us much information concerning the malpractices and exactions of the tax-farmers.7 The fiscal system established by the Mongols and tax-farming were primary reasons for the calamitous situation of the ra'iyyat, particularly the settled peasants, almost the majority of whom were on the verge of penury previous to Ghazan's reforms. The lawlessness and violence of the feudal lords, first and foremost, of the Mongol-Turkish nomad nobility and the military caste down to its lowest ranks, were causes no less important.8 These are typified by the remarks of Ghazan, that" in the eyes of the governors and others even clods of earth call forth esteem, but the ra'iyyat do n o t " that " the rubbish on the roads was not trodden underfoot as were the ra'iyyat", and that the Iranian ra'iyyat were so demeaned and terrorized,

that were a fly to steal their bread, they would not dare oppose it.1 These words show clearly the contrast between the fiction of freedom in law (in accordance with Moslem law) and the actual unprivileged and depressed position of the ra'iyyat.
THE FISCAL SYSTEM UNDER THE IL-KHANS
The fiscal system, like the whole Mongol system of government, was a monstrous and self-contradictory combination of methods introduced by the nomad conquerors (partly influenced by China—taxation per head of the population) and ancient Iranian traditions kept up by the 'Abbasid caliphate. The Mongol fiscal system has attracted the atten tion of a number of investigators.2 Nevertheless the meaning of certain terms used in taxation and the nature of the taxes they designated are still very often unclear and have not been determined. This is explained by the insufficiency and in some cases the vagueness of the sources, and also by the fact that one and the same term had a different meaning at different times and in different regions. The latter circumstance is evidently to be explained by the fact that the different areas had dis similar fiscal regulations and traditions, whilst the tendency of Moslem lawyers to consider the tax system as a unified whole inclined them to use a common terminology for taxes that differed at times in various districts. The sources mention about 45 terms for taxes and obligations of the Il-Khan period that survived in part into the following period. Some of these terms are however synonyms. The majority of them were known before the Mongols, under the Saljuqs or even earlier. The tax system of the Mongols nonetheless weighed much more heavily upon the population of Iran than the fiscal systems of earlier epochs. This was because of the high, inexactly ascertained rates of tax and the arbitrary methods of collection practised by the authorities, and not because of the imposition of new taxes. (Rashid al-Din and Vassaf note the practice of exacting one and the same tax several times in one year or exacting it several years in advance.) A final reason for this was the fact that a

ruined country could not bear such a tax burden. The burden was made more heavy by tax-farming and by covering State expenditure with assignations (bardt, havala), payment of which was imposed on the ra'iyyat. Whilst it is true that both practices existed under previous rulers, they greatly expanded under the Mongols, and Ghazan's fiscal policy was only a palliative. The whole weight of the tax burden fell of course on the peasant raciyyat, and the lower and middle ranks of the town dwellers; the upper classes—"the people of the sword" and the "people of the p e n " were either free from taxes or passed them on to the quit-rent peasants of their estates. The main tax before the Mongol conquest was, as is known, the kharaj—the land tax. A new tax came into existence alongside it in the Mongol period, and in some cases replaced the kharaj. This was the qubchur. A s Quatremere has shown,1 the qubchur was at first only a tax on pasture land. Qubchur kept its original technical meaning of one out of every 100 head of cattle or i per cent amongst the Mongols under the Il-Khans,2 from which it is evident that taxes paid by the nomads remained insignificant. But shortly after the Mongol conquest the Mongol authorities began to use the word qubchur, a term familiar to them, to designate the basic direct tax paid by town and country dwellers. Thus the qubchur meant two basically distinct taxes: the i per cent paid by the nomads; and the tax on the settled population, which, as can be seen from Juvaini and Rashid al-Dln, was paid in money even after Ghazan's reforms, and must have been very difficult for the peasants to pay, since they had to sell their grain to raise the money. The nature of the qubchur remains far from clear. The opinion has been expressed that the qubchur paid by the settled population corresponds to the kharaj, but this has not been proved, as is shown by Minorsky.3 It has also been shown that in some areas only one of the taxes was collected—the qubchur in one, the kharaj in another.4 Indeed Rashid alDin mentions " qubchur regions " (vildydt~i qubchur!) ; 5 in other vilayats, for example Khuzistan, only the kharaj was exacted.6 But there were regions like Fars where both the qubchur and the kharaj were paid.7 It is not known what the basis of the distinction was.

From information given by Naşir al-Din Tüsi,1 we can see that the qubchur was a poll tax under Hülegü (and evidently later) and that it was imposed on all subjects first of all by the Mongols contrary to Muslim law, which exempted the Mohammedans. The qubchur was graded according to the property of the tax-payer, and its rate changed often.2 Rashid al-Din relates that the qubchur was usually farmed out, and that there were governors who took i o times, and even 20 or 30 times the qubchur from the ra'iyyat of their vilâyats (the latter being evidently an exaggeration).3 Qubchur returns under Ghazan are not known. One can deduce from the decree of Ghazan only that the overall sum from each district was ascertained on the basis of fixed estimated expenditure {ikhrâjât-i muqarrarT) and was then divided amongst the ra'iyyat on the basis of previous tax lists.4 The term qubchur disappears from documents under the Jalayirids, but the tax itself—poll tax, paid by Muslims as well—was still in existence later under the name of sar-shumara or sarana.
A s we have already said, the kharâj was mostly collected in kind as part of the crop (the ancient muqdsama) in the Il-Khanid period, but it was paid in cash5 on a measured area (the ancient misâha) in the country side near to such towns as Baghdad and Şhirâz. The rate of the tax was not the same in each vilâyat. In one of Ghazan's decrees the part of the crop given by the peasant to the Divân (kharâj) was fixed at 1/3 to 1 /4.6 But in Khüzistân, as we have said, the kharâj from state-owned land was fixed during the reign of Ghazan at 6/10 of the crop. In one Jalayirid document the rate of the kharâj is stipulated as 2/10 of the harvest in kind (bahra), "according to the custom of the vilâyat".7 Apart from the basic kharâj {asl-i kharâj or simply aşl) there was also an additional sum—far\8 The far' was supposed to be 1/10 of the basic kharâj, according to Vaşşâf, and from 1/10 to 2/10, according to Naşir al-Din Tüsi.9 The terms aşl-i kharâj and far6 were known long before the Mongol conquest.10 The tithe Çuşhr or dabyak), in other words the lands tax at the

alleviated rate of i/10 of the crop in kind,1 was exacted from privately owned lands (mulk> arbdbt)2 under the Il-Khans. Apparently this was a special privilege of the landowners. It did not apply to peasants paying quit-rent, who had to pay rent to landlords {bahra-ji mdlikdna), as well as 'ushr to the divan. The sources give conflicting information on the qalan> which is evidently explained by the fact that it signified different taxes and duties at different times and in different places. Grigor of Akner and Rashid al-Dln speak of the qalan as a kind of military service. But the table of taxes of Khuzistan show it to be the upkeep of the military aristo cracy (amirs) during their tours and military expedition,3 whilst the amount raised by the qalan was a meagre 1,200 dinars from the whole of Khuzistan, compared with the total tax from the region of 325,000 dinars.4 But the thirteenth-century Persian poet Pur-i Baha, in a qasida in honour of the historian and administrator cAla' al-Dln Juvaini speaks of the qalan and the qubchur as the two main taxes that bore heavily and with ruinous effect upon the population.5 We conclude from this that the term qalan was here used in place of khardj. Earlier we mentioned the tax that the Mongols introduced for the first time, the tamgha> which was paid on all forms of trade and urban crafts, even prostitution,6 and which replaced the Moslem %akdt at the rate of 2-5 per cent. (There is no mention of zakat in documents of the thirteenth century and after.) The rate of the tamgha is not known exactly. But from the letter of Rashid al-Dln to his spiritual counsellor Sadr al-Din Turka'i7 we can conclude that the rate was 10 per cent of the value of each commercial transaction originally, and that Ghazan cut it by half in some towns and in other towns abrogated it for a period (for example, in the towns of Khuzistan). The term 'avdrid meant a special tax to cover extraordinary expenses, but was in fact regularly imposed and was extremely ruinous.8 We can

judge its character from a tale of Saifi. In 716/1317 the governor of Khurasan, the Amir Yasa'ul, desiring to organize a celebration in honour of his daughter on the occasion of her marriage with the son of Prince Yasa'ur, imposed 'avarid of 300,000 dinars on the ra'iyyat of Khurasan, 50,000 of which were to be paid by Herat. T w o naibs with fifty horsemen, arriving in Herat on the day of the Festival of the Sacrifice (czd-i qurbdn), drove the inhabitants out of the mosque with sticks, and laid 100 to 200 dinars tax on all whom they caught and bound. They extorted it on the spot, beating and torturing, wounding and making invalids of about 200 citizens. By sunset they had collected 50,000 dinars.1 'Avarid was already resorted to under Mahmud of Ghazna.2 The words calafa and 'ulufa (lit. fodder, forage) signified a collection in kind to provide food and fodder for the military caste and the army in a given district. According to the sources, this exaction consisted of grain, straw, oxen, sheep, poultry, wine, and sometimes money. In 707/1307 the general Muhammad Sam demanded 500 kharvars of grain, 500 rams, 50 horses, 30 slaves {barda) and 10,000 dinars for his army from the vassals of the lord of Herat.3 The taghdr was the same tax, but in a narrower sense, being only paid in grain, at the rate of 100 mans ( = 1 kharvar, or ass load). The general poll-tax (sar-shumdray sardna — qubchur) introduced by the Mongols, which we have already mentioned, must not be confused with the ancient poll-tax based on Moslem law, exacted from the nonMoslems—the jizya. After the Mongol conquest the jizya ceased to exist. Ghazan restored the jizya paid by the heterodox (October 1295) after his conversion to Islam, but quickly abolished it (1296)4 because of the intercession of the Nestorian patriarch Mar Yabalaha III, an Uighur by birth (1281-1317). But in 1306 the jizya was restored again by Oljeitu, and this time for good.5 Under Sultan Uvais the jizya paid by Christians and Jews (men only) was 8 dinars from the rich, 6 from those of middle condition, and 4 from the poorer people.6 It is not clear whether the jizya was paid by the heterodox instead of the sarshumara, or together with it. In some districts khana-shumdra1 (i.e. tax paid by household or family) was exacted in place of sar-shumara. Tax on gardens was paid in fruit—bdgh-shumdra8—and was evidently

identical with the thamārāt (fruit).1 This tax derives from the time of Khusrau I Anushirvān, who laid a tax on fruit trees.2 Increases in the kharāj and other taxes were reflected in the terms tafdvut (difference), taufīr (increase),3 jāvaid (excess), and nemeri (Mongol: addition).4 Details and rates of these taxes are not specified more exactly. The term ikhrājāt (lit. expenditure), frequently encountered in the sources, evidently referred to the whole group of circumstantial and permanent taxes paid by the ra'iyyat to cover the cost of officials touring the latters' districts (tkhrājāt-i sādir u vārid)? Expenditure covered by estimates (rnuqarrari) was distinguished from expenses beyond the estimates (kharifiyat). The following taxes evidently belonged to the group: haqq al-taqrlr (synonym—rasm al-vi%ara)—as we see from the correspondence of Rashid al-Dln;6 a tax in kind (grain, sugar, etc.) for the support of the Grand Vazīr: rasm al-sadara {haqq al-tauliyja)—a tax collected from the ra'iyyat of vaqf lands for the Grand Sadr at the rate of 10 per cent:7 rusūm-i shahnagī or dārūghakī—a tax for the governor of a province (shahna, darugha, basqaq); rusūm-i 'ammāl (rasm-i khazāna, Arabic-Persian)—a tax for the upkeep of officials of the Exchequer (kharim, bait al֊māl), fixed at z out of every 100 dinars tax from the time of Ghazan;8 haqq at-tahsīl ("share of the tax")—for the tax collector (muhassi/, tahsīldār) ; 9 and har%—a tax at the preliminary estimate of a crop, and similar taxes. The term tarh signified the compulsory sale of products by the ra'iyyat to the Exchequer or local ruler at prices much below market value, and the compulsory purchase by the ra'iyyat of goods lying in government stores at prices far beyond that value. The meaning of the term is explained by A . A. Alizade.10

"Presents "from the ra'iyyat to the Il-Khan, to members of his family, to dignitaries, and to the local feudalists (Persianptshkash, Mongol sa'uri, Turkish tu^ghit) were obligatory upon their arrival in a district, or upon the occasion of some festivity, and their proportions were established. Thus one of Ghazan's decrees states that a wine-skin of fruit-juice should contain 50 Tabriz mans in payment of scfuri to the residence of Il-Khan, whilst a wine-skin of fruit-juice given on the occasion of a festivity should hold 40 mans.1 The gathering of ra'iyyat for forced labour has already been mentioned. It was one of their heaviest duties. N o less heavy for them was the obligation to billet (Arabic nu%fil> Turkish qonalgha)—the duty of taking into their houses the innumerable messengers, amirs, military persons, and officials, together with their staffs, and then to feed and entertain them. According to Rashid al-Din, every basqaq who toured a region with his staff occupied at least a hundred houses at one time. " I n every neighbourhood", he says, " where a messenger decided to stay, the in habitants were immediately subjected to constraint, since his slaves and military servants lowered themselves into neighbouring courtyards from the flat roofs, and stole whatever their eyes fell on. They shot their arrows at pigeons and chickens, and often hit children. What ever they found that was eatable or drinkable or could be fed to their cattle, no matter to whom it belonged, they stole for them selves."2 Since the messengers were arriving all the time, when one left a house, another would be billeted in it the very same day. " Every year", relates Rashid al-Din, "under various pretexts messengers took away several thousand cows, bedding, cauldrons, pots and utensils belonging to the inhabitants. They stabled saddle animals and beasts of burden in the gardens, and in one day would ruin a garden which was the product of ten years' work and a thousand difficulties over come."3 Ghazan abolished the right to billet in the houses of the ra'iyyat and ordered the construction of special government hostelries. But already by the time of the Il-Khan Abu. Sa'id the obligation to billet had appeared yet again. We can ascertain this from the fact that the reason for the uprising of the Sarbadars in Khurasan (737/1337) was the unbridled licence of a Mongol messenger who stopped for lodging at the village of Bashtin and demanded wine and a woman. Under Sultan Uvais decrees were again issued to forbid billeting in the houses

of the ra'iyyat.1 O f course the obligation to billet existed in Iran before the Mongol conquest,2 but never before did it assume such propor tions of national disaster as it did under the Mongols, according to Raşhid al-Din, when many of the ra'iyyat deliberately kept their houses in a delapidated condition, which however did not always help. The carriage duty (Turkish ulagh)—the obligation of the ra'iyyat to provide animals for riding and carrying on the postal service (band, Turkish yam)—was already in existence at the time of the caliphate. But only in the Mongol period do the sources describe it as a national calamity.
" I t is impossible to calculate", says Rashid al-Din, "how many asses the ulagh took each year from the ra'iyyat, the merchants, and others, and how many thousands of ra'iyyat had their heads, arms, and legs broken by the messengers. The ra'iyyat were all the time wandering about in search of their animals, taken from them for government transport, and did not know what to do. Some of their animals had been driven away for good, and were not returned. Others were left by the roadside to die; and the ra'iyyat neg lected the farms and their work."3
Such were in general the system of taxes and obligations and its terminology under the Il-Khans. We shall not dwell here upon a number of fiscal terms which are insufficiently clear. Taxes and obliga tions not based on Moslem law (that is, apart from the kharâj, 'ushr, jizya, and zakât) were covered by the term takâlîf, taklıjât-i divânla But beside these there were taxes arbitrarily fixed by local authorities, denoted in the sources by the terms shiltaqat (Arabicized plural of the Mongol sbiltaq, pretext (for extortion) and shandqis (plural of Arabic shanqasa—synonym of istiqsa*—"draining to the uttermost, exhausting utterly").5 The system of taxes and services of the Il-Khân state was without a doubt based on the merciless exploitation of the settled working population by both the state and the feudal leadership connected with it. The scale of feudal rent and taxation was completely out of propor tion with the economic development of the country. Attempts to

reform this system and make it less hard on the peasants and town dwellers—under Ghazan and the early Jalayirids—gave but temporary and relative periods of economic revival. In sum, this system, together with the general ruin of the period of the Mongol conquest, was the main factor in the inability of Iran to regain the level that it had reached by the beginning of the thirteenth century. High rates of feudal rent and tax were the chief causes of the popular uprisings in Iran.



CHAPTER 7
RELIGION UNDER THE MONGOLS
As we have already seen, at the time of the Mongol conquest most of Iran was Sunni; indeed, says Mole, this was " one of the most Islamized countries in the Middle and Near East".1 Small Zoroastrian minorities existed in one or two centres, but played only a secondary role in the country's religious life. There were also Jews and Christians, but the latter were far less numerous than in the Arabic-speaking countries of Syria, Egypt, and Iraq. A summary of the distribution of the various Muslim schools and sects in Iranian territory has been given above, pp. 283-302. The Mongol invasion of Persia, which began in 1220, together with the subsequent fall of the Baghdad caliphate (1258) and the killing of the last 'Abbasid caliph, al-Musta'sim billah, brought the entire Muslim world and especially Persia face to face with unexpected and formidable problems. For the first time in the history of Islam a great part of the Muslim world found itself under the rule of a non-Muslim power—and not only non-Muslim, but one which, to begin with, was in general ^////-Muslim. A t the same time, however, when the Mongols destroyed the external and political power of the reformed Isma'Ilism of Alamut, they thus saved orthodox Islam from the continual menace which it represented. And their destruction of the Sunni caliphate in Baghdad meant that for the first time Sunnism was deprived of every semblance of political authority, and this could only be an advantage for Shi'ism. The presence of a ShTi theologian, and one of the greatest of the time, among Hiilegu's advisers was, to say the least, significant. There has been a tendency to exaggerate the unimportance of the decadent Sunni caliphate under the last 'Abbasids. In reality, it was precisely the decline of the caliphs' political power that led them to accentuate certain more specifically "religious" aspects (in the Western sense) of this institution. For example, when they were trying to dissuade Hiilegu. from attacking the capital, the caliph's ambassadors said to him: " I f the caliph is killed, the whole world will be disorgan ized, the Sun will hide his face, the rain will cease to fall and the plants

will no longer grow."1 This is the typical notion of the " sacred monarch" to be found in many Asiatic traditions, and it is significant that the Mongols themselves, who in some respects had similar ideas concerning the sanctity of sovereignty, seem to have believed the ambassadors up to a certain point. In fact, when Musta'sim was taken prisoner by Hülegü's hordes, some of the Sunnis who were with the Mongols said that " i f Hülegü spills the blood of the caliph on the ground, he and his infidel Mongols will be swallowed up by the earth. He must not be killed.. . . The accursed Hülegü feared that if he let the caliph live, the Muslims would rise in revolt, and that if he slew him with a sword and his blood was spilled on the ground, there would be an earthquake." He therefore had him killed by the well-known method, without any shedding of blood.2 Contemporary sources are full of interesting references to this sacral aspect of the caliph; even Hülegü's court astrologer, Husâm al-Dln, had predicted six disasters if Baghdad were to be attacked. Fortunately for Hülegü his Shi'i adviser Naşir al-Dln Tüsi was able to show that Husâm al-Dln's astrological deductions were wrong.3 That the ShTis were not very grieved by the fall of the 'Abbasid caliphate is evident in practically all the sources, even if one disregards the "treachery" of the last 'Abbasid's Shi'i minister, Ibn al-'Alqami (d. 656/1258), and the presence in Hülegü's retinue of Naşir al-Din Tüsi. Certain hadlths had been cir culating for some time, which might well have persuaded the Şhfls to collaborate with Hülegü: according to one, for example, the " Turks" would help the Mahdl or the Q/Tim to achieve victory ;4 and there were other similar stories. It is known that while Hülegü was preparing to lay siege to Baghdad, several Shi'I communities surrendered to him, and a rumour also spread that, under the influence of Naşir al-Din Tüsi, he had become a Muslim. O n the other hand, the fall of the caliphate had a disastrous effect on the Sunnis, and all the Sunni historians speak of it as if it were a cosmic catastrophe, while poets wrote elegies on the death of al-Musta'şim, on that occasion Sa'dl, the great Persian poet, composed two qafidaS) one in Arabic and the other in Persian. But while the psycho logical effects on the Sunnis are evident, the theological consequences

540
are less clear. The true caliphate, which combined the spiritual with the temporal power, had long since ceased to exist. Despite the fact that princes even in distant lands like India had theoretically to be invested by the Caliph of Baghdad, it is no exaggeration to say that his effective authority during the decadence of the 'Abbasid dynasty was spiritual rather than temporal. The comparison between the pope and the caliph is not a recent European invention, but can be found for the first time in the diary of the Shafi'i qadi Jamal al-Din Muhammad b. Salim of Hama, in Syria, who in 1260, that is shortly after the fall of Baghdad, visited Italy and went to the court of King Manfred, son of Frederick II, as envoy of the Mamluk Sultan Baibars. Here he speaks of the pope, as "the Caliph of the Franks". This is interesting, because it was Baibars who in 1261 with great pomp installed an uncle of the dead al-Mustacsim as " Caliph", conferring upon him functions which were somewhat "spiritual" and nominal. Ignoring the realities of the situation, Sunni writers of treatises continued to repeat the old notion of a caliphate pure and simple, even at a time when it had become a fairy tale or had disappeared altogether. The more intelligent among them, such as Ibn Khaldun in the fourteenth century, admitted that after the disappearance of Arab dominion nothing was left of the caliphate but the name;1 while al-Nasafi (d. 537/1142) and Ibrahim Halabi (d. 1549) maintained that the real caliphate had lasted only thirty years, until the death of 'AH. It is therefore not surprising that the theological effects of the fall of the Baghdad caliphate were very slight. The Mongol invasion, then, strengthened the non-Muslim communi ties in Persia. Chingiz-Khan and Ogedei were shamanists who had no desire to be converted to any other religion, though Chingiz-Khan was interested in other creeds and made inquiries, both directly and indirectly, about the usages and customs of foreign religious com munities. Guyiik had strong leanings towards Christianity, even if he actually remained a shamanist. Mongke seems to have been somewhat indifferent to religious matters, but as soon as Qubilai embraced the Buddhist faith and his brother Hiilegii also showed leanings towards that religion (in fact it is almost certain that the latter became a Bud dhist), shamanism lost all its official significance. This did not happen, however, with the traditional religious customs of the Mongols. Sorcerers were still numerous and respected, and Abaqa greeted with joy a magician (sdhir) named Baraq, who visited him in 1278.2 The
1 Muqaddima^ transl. Rosenthal, vol. 1, pp. 402-78. 2 Rashid al-Din, vol. 1, p. 267.



RELIGION UNDER THE MONGOLS
541
figure of the shaman in the religious world of the Mongols in Iran disappeared more or less definitely during the reign of Arghun (128491), when Buddhism was being practised more thoroughly and con scientiously. But the real nature of Buddhism in Il-Khanid Iran and its influence on the Muslims of that country is an unsolved, and perhaps insoluble, problem, chiefly because of the lack of reliable sources. (In contrast, we know that the Mongols had a considerable influence on the Persian language.) Iran must have been full of Buddhist temples — w e hear of them only when they were destroyed in 1295-6—and in these temples there must have been numerous priests. Buddhism was particularly strong under Arghun, who even caused Buddhist priests to be brought from India, and is said to have died as a result of treat ment prescribed for him by an unidentified "Indian y o g i " . (For contacts between Sufis and Buddhist priests, see below, pp. 545-6.) Nestorian Christianity was also widespread, especially among the women of the Il-Khans' family; Mongke's mother, several of his wives, and Hulegii's wife were all Christians, as were many other women (including, of course, Abaqa's wife Maria, known as Despoina Khatun, who was an illegitimate daughter of the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII). These women often had their children baptized, and at least two Il-Khans, Ahmad Teguder and Oljeitii, were Christians in their childhood. As regards the Jews, their position was considerably strengthened by the success of individual Jews in obtaining court appointments, a notable case being the physician and minister of Arghun, Sacd al-Daula, who was a mortal enemy of the Muslims and favoured his fellow-Jews in every possible way by using his influence over the sovereign. But even royal favour was not enough to save him from popular fury, and he was executed in 1291. According to Vassaf (d. first half of fourteenth century), Sa'd al-Daula tried to gain the favour of the Il-Khan by declaring that Chingiz-Khan was a prophet, that the gift of prophecy was hereditary, and that Arghun should follow in the footsteps of the prophet Muhammad and found a new umma (religious nation), which would be universal and would turn the Ka'ba into a pagoda! Another important figure of the Il-Khanid period is also said to have been a Jew, at all events by origin. This was Rashid al-Din, a physician and a famous historian of the Ghazan period; he too was killed, in 1318, but his death did not completely put an end to the influence of Jews at the Il-Khanid court. The 16th of June 1295 (1 Sha'ban 694) was a very important day in the



RELIGION UNDER THE MONGOLS
542
history of religion in Il-Khanid Persia, for on that day, a few months before his accession to the throne, Prince Ghazan was converted to Islam and assumed the Muslim name of Mahmud, at Firuzkuh in the presence of Shaikh Sadr al-Din Ibrahim al-Hamawi. It is true that the Il-Khan Tegiider (d. 1284) had previously been converted to Islam and had taken the name of Ahmad, but this was purely a personal matter and had no sequel. Ghazan, on the other hand, made the whole of his court and large numbers of the Mongols in Iran become Muslims. Thus, after a lapse of some seventy years, Islam again became the official religion of Iran; moreover Ghazan started a veritable persecution of Buddhists and other believers. O f particular interest is the following passage from the Jdmi' al-tawdrikh:
When the Lord of Islam, Ghazan, became a Muslim, he commanded that all the idols should be broken and all the pagodas {but-khdnd) and {atash-kadd) destroyed, together with all the other temples the presence of which in Muslim countries is forbidden by the sharl'a, and that all the community {jama6at) of the idolatrous bakhshi [a Turkish word derived from the Chinese po-shih "teacher"] should be converted [forcibly] to Islam. But since the Most High God did not aid them, they had no true faith, but were Muslims only outwardly and by necessity, and in their district (ndhiyd) there were signs of unbelief (kufr) and of aberration (daldlat). After a certain time the King of Islam perceived their hypocrisy and said to them: "Let those among you who wish it return to India, to Kashmir, to Tibet, and to the countries whence they came; and let those who remain here cease to be hypocrites, and let them believe in that which they have in their hearts and cease from defiling with their hypocrisy the true religion of Islam. And if it should come to my ears that they are building fire-temples or pagodas, I will without hesitation put them to the sword." But some persevered in their hypocrisy, while others again returned to their wicked beliefs. And Ghazan said: " M y father was an idolater and died an idolater and built for himself a temple which he made vaqjioT that community [of the bakhshi\ That temple I have destroyed; go ye there and live on alms [among those ruins]."1
It would seem that this "temple of Arghun", like other temples, contained portraits of the deceased sovereign, which the women of his family tried in vain to save from the iconoclastic zeal of the neophyte Ghazan. Besides destroying the temples of the idolaters, Ghazan also em barked on an active cultural policy in support of Islam. According to the sources he was a frequent visitor of the mosques, arranged for public readings of the Qur'an, had a particular reverence for the Shi'i

holy places in Mesopotamia, built mosques in every village, and founded numerous religious institutions for the poor in the larger towns and also in Mecca. He seems to have devoted particular care to the building of ddr a/siyddaSy which were kinds of hostels in which the descendants of the Prophet (sayyids) were accommodated free of charge. Among the holy foundations he created, Rashid al-Dln even mentions a kind of shed in which birds could find shelter and food during the winter months, and in this Ghazan may have been influenced by similar Hindu and Buddhist practices. In his definite leaning towards Shfism Ghazan visited the Shf1 sanctuaries in Mesopotamia, and it would seem that he even had coins struck bearing inscriptions of the Shfi type. His brother and successor Oljeitii went still further. Originally a Christian, he subsequently became a Buddhist and eventually a Muslim. But even after embracing the Muslim religion he still seemed uncertain, since he was first a Hanafi, then a Shafi', until, disgusted with the sectarian squabbles among the various Sunni schools, and influenced by Taj al-Dln Avajl of Mashhad and by Jamal al-Din Mutahhir, Oljeitii finally went over to Shfism, despite the efforts to win him back to Buddhism made by the hakhshis1 who had remained in Iran. His son and successor Abu. Sa'Id, however, was a Sunni. This in itself is sufficient to show that these conversions must be ascribed mainly to the activities of preachers and propagandists of the various sects in court circles. For example, it is not clear whether Oljeitii's Shfi tendencies brought about any spread of Shfism among his Persian subjects, and some of the sources even tell us that before he died he was converted once again to Sunnism. Most Persian Muslims, even during the. Mongol and Il-Khanid eras, remained Sunnites. In addition to Baghdad, Isfahan and Shiraz were the citadels of Sunnism in Iran, and during the reign of Oljeitii, according to Ibn Battuta (fourteenth century), it was in these centres that the population and the scholars offered the most vigorous resist ance to the unsuccessful attempts to convert them forcibly to Shfism. Despite such sporadic attempts, however, it may be said that the traditional hostility between the two great branches of Islam became less acute after the end of the Sunni caliphate in Baghdad and when the Il-Khanid government—unlike that of the Saljuqs—began to show more sympathy for Shfism, i.e. Twelver Shfism (we shall deal later with the

extremist sects). A n example of this rapprochement is the Aurâd alahbdb wa fuşüş al-dddby a mystical book of devotions written in 723/ 1323 by the Süfi Sunnite Abû'l-Mafâkhir Yahya Bâkharzi, which contains prayers handed down by Shi'i imams whose names are each followed by the formula radiya Hldhu 'anhu, " M a y G o d be pleased with him". On the Shi'! side, too, a more conciliatory attitude became perceptible. The great theologian and mystic Şadr al-Dln Ibrahim (644/1246-722/1322), who influenced Ghazan to become a Muslim, was, like his father, a Sunni, but nevertheless he studied under Naşir al-Din Tüsî and other learned Şhfis, and there are many pro-ShTi features in his work, Fara'id al-simtain ft mandqib al-rasül wa H-batül wa H-murtadd wa H-sibtain. A proof of the interest Ghazan himself took in the "family of the Prophet" are the numerous hostels he founded, these being rather like vaqfs endowed with funds in order to help the sayjids in the various districts. In some cases people sought refuge in Shi'ism because they were disgusted with the squabble among the different Sunni schools, and especially, as regards Iran, between ShafTites and the Hanafites. Typical of these was the quarrel at Öljeitü's court between some Hanafite scholars and the Shâfi'i qâdî Nizâm al-Din 'Abd al-Malik of Mamgheh, which became so violent that "the Mongol amir Qutlugh-Shah turned to the other amir and said: 'Why have we abandoned the Yasa of Chingiz-Khân and the religion of our fore fathers and accepted this religion of the Arabs, which is divided into so many sects ?' " x It would seem that this episode was one of the reasons why Öljeitü embraced Shi'ism. But it was during the Mongol and Il-Khânid period that Twelver Şhi'i theology became stabilized in forms which were to become canonical, and, though subjected to modifications, were never sup planted. The two leading representatives of Şhi'i thinking at this time were Naşir al-Din Tusi (d. 672/1274) and his disciple 'Allama Hilli (d. 726/1326). O f the former, who was an astronomer, philosopher, jurist, and a theologian of encyclopaedic knowledge, it is difficult to give a concise description, and here we will only add that he was one of the founders of Imamite theology and that his innumerable works have been the subject of many commentaries. The second man, like his uncle Muhaqqiq Hilli (d. 676/1277), was a theologian and jurist rather than a philosopher, and his treatises form the basis of all subse quent Şhi'i canonical law.

The trend towards Shi'ism in many circles was due above all to mysticism, which at this time revealed many interesting Shi'i features. A t the time of the Mongol invasion two tariqas had a predominant influence in Iran: the Kubraviyya in the East and the Suhravardiyya in the West. A characteristic of the Sufism of this period is its deeper study of the philosophical and theoretical aspect of doctrine, this being partly due to the influence of Ibn "Arabi, whose disciples in the East included Sadr al-Dln Muhammad b. Ishaq Qonavi (d. 673/1274), author of Fukuk, Miftdh al-ghaiby and Nafahdt-i I/dhiyya, and Qonavi's disciple the well-known Persian poet "Iraqi (d. 688/1289), who wrote the famous La/va'dt annotated by Jami. Ecstatic Sufism was gradually being transformed into Hrfdn (gnosis) and penetrating more and more into Persian lyric poetry, nearly all of which at this time was strongly influenced by Sufism. But parallel with this esoteric level ran the "practical" form of Sufism, whose leading exponents were Farid alDin "Attar (who is said to have been killed by the Mongols in 618/1221 at a very advanced age) and later Jalal al-Dln of Balkh (d. at Qonya in 672/1273), founder of the famous tariqa called the maulaviyjUy in which particular importance was attached to mystic dancing. The Mathnav։֊i Mcfnavi and the Dwdn-i Shams-i Tabri^ by Maulana Jalal al-Din are two of the best works produced by Persian religious genius. In the progressive penetration of Shi'ism into Persian Sufism, the kubraviyya school was particularly important. Kubra himself was the great Sufi master of the Khwarazm, and he was killed about 618/1221 at the time of the Mongol invasion. Although a Shafi'i Sunnite, he is said to have had leanings towards Shi'ism, but his eulogies of "All and of the ahl al-bait are common to all Sufis, and they do not prove that Kubra favoured Shi'ism more than other writers. His first-generation disciples appear to have been all Sunnis, and uncommon trends are to be found only in the works of Sacd al-Din Hamuya, who is said to have taught that the auliyd9 of the Muslim community are twelve in number, and that the twelfth is the sahib al-^amdfiy who will return to bring justice to all the world: an interesting adaptation of the Sufi doctrine of the twelve imams. Later, in the person of the Kubravi Shaikh 'Ala' al-Daula Samnani (d. 756/1335), we meet a writer of unusual originality. O f particular interest for our study are the relations with the religious leaders at the court of Arghun, in whose service he spent some time during the Mongol period. He had a great admiration for the ascetic achievements of the bakhshis, one of whom helped him to

solve certain problems in his spiritual life, but he distrusted the monistic tendencies in the Indian religions. Nevertheless, Indian influences may perhaps have inspired his theory of the "inner" or subtle "senses" (Jatifd). In the interesting " confessions", which form part of his Safwat al-urwciy Samnani clearly showed his partiality for Sunnism, but he was scandalized by the quarrels among the various juridical schools and did not adhere to any single school. Finally his soul found rest in Sunnism, but in admitting that 'All alone of all the caliphs achieved perfection in all three aspects of the imamate—khildfa, vardtha, and valdja—he came in many respects closer to Shi'ism than to Sunnism. We may thus conclude with Mole that "his conception of Süfism and its role enabled him to construct something resembling a Sunnite Shi'ism, which, although opposed to the ravdfid, exalts the role of the ahl al-bait, and especially that of ' A l l " . The remaining links in this chain of Kubrávi Süfism tinged with Shi'ism would take us beyond the Mongol and Il-Khanid era. After Kubrá's Sunni Süfism, in which he acknowledged'All, and after the frank and tolerant Sunnism of Samnani, we have in the works of'All Hamadani (d. 786/1584) a vigorous Sunnism in sharVa side by side with extreme Shi'i ideas in tariqa, followed by the openly professed Shi'ism of Nürbakhsh (d. 869/1464). The imper ceptible transition from Sunnism to Shi'ism, which first appears in the Kubraviyya tariqa, exercised a great influence on Islam in Iran, and is the explanation for the acceptance of confessional Shi'ism in the Safavid era. The Shi'i tendencies in the kubraviyya, however, were not the only instances of the curious Shi'i Süfism which began in Iran at this time. Another is the Shaikhiyya-Jüriyya sibila in Khurasan, which had con siderable political importance since it was linked with the Sarbadárid movement. The Shaikhiyya of Khurasan were followers of Shaikh Khalifa (killed in 736/1335), who was a Mázandaráni by origin and —an interesting point—a disciple of 'Alá' al-Daula Samnani, with whom, however, he seems to have had certain disagreements. At Sabzavár in Khurasan Khalifa founded a school of mysticism, which many of the inhabitants of the city joined. Sabzavár had long been a centre of Shi'ism, but we know very little about the teachings of Shaikh Khalifa. At all events they were considered heretical by the Sunni faqih of the city who in vain implored the Il-Khan A b ü Sa'id to get rid of Khalifa. Eventually he was secretly murdered by local Sunnites and was succeeded by one of his disciples, Hasan Jürí, who gave the movement a character which was more markedly Shi'i and



RELIGION UNDER THE MONGOLS
at the same time more military than it had been. The names of all the adherents were recorded in writing and they were advised " t o keep themselves hidden until the day of the rising".1 The movement, unlike the other tariqas, which were far more peaceful in their attitude towards the ruling powers, had all the characteristics of a social revolt (it would appear that Hasan Juri himself was of peasant origin). After the death of the founder, Hasan Juri found a large number of new supporters in Nishapur, in Tus, Khabushan, Abivard, and so on, who joined forces with the Sarbadarids and helped to create the curious " Shi'i republic" of Sabzavar. The military and political vicissitudes of the Sarbadarids, however, are outside the scope of our argument, since they continued into the post-ll-Khanid period. Hasan Juri was arrested about the year 739/1338 and died shortly afterwards. The mixture of militarism, social reform, and Shi'ism characteristic of the Shaikhiyya-Juriyya tariqa is also found in the movement of the followers of Mir Qivam al-Din Mar'ashi, in Mazandaran, which the sources definitely describe as a branch of the Shaikhiyya-Juriyya tariqa, and in fact it was Hasan Juri who granted the title of Shaikh to Qivam al-Din's father, 'Izz al-Din Sugandi. The latter died while returning from Sabzavar to Mazandaran, and his son succeeded him as head of the Mazandarani branch of the tariqa. At Amul, about the middle of the century, Qivam al-Din became the head of a mass movement and founded a miniature Shi'i state. His confraternity, like the ShaikhiyyaJuriyya, was definitely Shi'i, and the Mar'ashi were a family of sayyid descended from 'All Zain al-'Abidin. Another group of Sufis who first sympathized with Shi'ism and then embraced it completely were the Safavids, who were destined to be the founders of the Safavid dynasty two centuries later, under which the whole of Persia was converted to Shi'ism. The founder of this confraternity, Shaikh Safi al-Din Ishaq of Ardabil (d. 735/1335), was a disciple of Shaikh Zahid Gilani (d. 700/1301), who in turn was a disciple of Jamal al-Din Jili (d. 651/1253), himself a follower of Najm al-Din Kubra. Nevertheless Shaikh Safi was undoubtedly a Sunni, and the "military" and Shi'i trends in his brotherhood did not make their appearance until after the Mongol period. In any case, Sufism with a Shi'i tinge remains the most important religious feature in Iran at this time, especially in view of later develop ments.

No description of the religious movements in Iran during the Mon gol and Il-Khanid eras would be complete without some mention of the extremist movements, some of which, rightly or wrongly, were accused of "Mazdakism"; in our discussion we shall exclude the Isma'ilis, who are dealt with elsewhere in this volume. One such movement began during the ninth year of the reign of Ogedei (122941), when a " maker of sieves " named Mahmud appeared in the village of Tarab, near Bukhara, who claimed to have remarkable magical powers, in particular that of curing the sick and receiving messages from spirits concerning occult matters. These powers were rumoured to have been taught to him by his sister, for, as Juvaini says, " i n Transoxiana and in Turkestan many persons, especially women, claim to have magical powers, and when anyone has a pain or falls ill, they visit him, summon the exorcist, and perform dances and similar nonsense, and in this manner convince the ignorant and the vulgar " ,x Mahmud Tarabi even managed to occupy Bukhara with the help of the peasants and artisans, who were living in dire poverty; but accord ing to the hostile chronicler Juvaini, his adherents also included nobles and learned Muslims. The Mongols had to despatch what was practically an expeditionary force to quell this rebellion, which, apart from its economic and social significance, throws an interesting light on popular beliefs in Iran at this time, and especially on the presence of messianic and thaumaturgical elements among the oppressed lower orders. Somewhat sketchy and incomplete are the references found in sources such as the Jam? al~tawdrikh and the Nu^hat al-qulub, to real or pretended "Mazdakite" movements in Il-Khanid Iran. These played an important role in the conspiracy of Prince Ala-Fireng, the elder son of Geikhatu (Jumada I 703/December 1303), who was persuaded by a "Mazdakite" sect to take over the reins of government. According to Rashid al-Din,2 the promoters of this conspiracy "passed themselves off as shaikhs [ m y s t i c s ] b u t in reality they had subversive social ideas. The heads of the sect were the pir Ya'qub Baghbani, a shaikh named Habib, w h o had once been khalifa (deputy) to Shaikh Rashid Bulghari, a sayyid named Kamal al-Din, and various others. Under a veil of mysticism, coupled with stories of miracles, and of the apparitions of angels, prophets, and saints, there lay concealed, says Rashid al Din, the ancient " way of thinking of Mazdak". Ideas of this kind were

RELIGION UNDER THE MONGOLS
549
widespread among the populace, though many influential personages were also said to be members of the sect, some of them from the entourage of the notorious finance minister Sadr al-Din, who was responsible for the introduction of paper money into Persia. The minister himself was said to have been a disciple of Shaikh Rashid Bulghäri, mentioned above. In any case the conspiracy was discovered and its religious leaders were executed. But these followers of Ya'qub Bäghbäni were not the only " Mazdakites" in Iran during those days. In his Nu^hat al֊qulub> a geographical treatise written in 1340, Mustaufi Qazvini gives a description of the province of Rödbär in Mäzandarän, not far from the Isma'ili fortress of Alamut, and after telling us that the inhabitants were Bätims (Isma'ilis), he adds that there also existed a group of people calling themselves Maräghiyyän, w h o were believed to be "Mazdakites". If Schwarz's unconvincing hypothesis is correct, the word Maräghiyyän means " m e n of Marägheh", and thus they would be the last remnants of the descendants of the followers of Päpak, who had fled from Äzarbäijän after the collapse of the Khurramite movement. A more probable explanation is that, by calling them "Mazdakites", the sources wished to stress certain extremist social tendencies, real or imaginary, in the ideas professed by these interesting sects, about whose real religious theories we know very little. In the history of religion in Iran, the Mongol period is important for a number of reasons. First, it saw a strengthening of Shfism as a consequence of the fall of the 'Abbasid caliphate, and this was accom panied by a proportionate mitigation of the Shf i-Sunni dispute, the appearance within Sufism of trends towards Shfism, and a leaning towards a certain tashayyu' hasan ("moderate" Shfism) in Sunni circles. In addition, certain Sufi and Shfi movements of a military kind were formed, which were the forerunners of the Safavid movement, while pseudo-Mazdakite eschatological and social movements occurred sporadically. A n d finally, Sufism made particularly noteworthy pro gress, especially in its doctrinal tendencies.



CHAPTER 8
POETS AND PROSE WRITERS OF THE LATE SALJUQ AND MONGOL PERIODS
This chapter touches on the era of the " Great Saljuqs" only in its last phase, that is, towards the end of the reign of Sultan Sanjar (d. 552/ 115 8), a monarch who was then decadent though he was later idealized. The Saljuqs are a remarkable phenomenon, and we should therefore cast at least a cursory glance back to the period of their real greatness; for this wholly Turkish dynasty, holding sway over an immense area, played a very considerable part in the expansion of the Persian literary language and of Persian culture in general. That the principal Saljuq rulers themselves showed a lack of culture was no obstacle to this, mainly because their internal policy was in the hands of Iranian counsel lors and trusted advisers, without whose help these barbarian warriors could scarcely have held their own in such a highly cultivated milieu. Moreover the example set by the policy of Sultan Mahmüd of Ghazna had a lasting effect: the Saljuq court teemed with Iranian scholars and Iranian writers. The official language was Persian, and in it was conducted the official correspondence of the court, in contrast to the practice under Mahmüd. This is one side of the picture. On the other, the waves of Turkish expansion were hastening the influence of that language in certain areas, with Turkish idioms even beginning to approach the position of the literary language. Whereas the expansion of the Saljuqs was to the west, embracing Syria, Asia Minor, and the Caucasus, the ousted Ghaznavids strove to establish a firm footing in Multan, the Punjab, and Sind, at the same time extending the sway of the Persian language and Persian literature in the upper social strata of their remaining Indian possessions. Similarly the courts of the Khwarazm-Shähs (1077-1231) and the Ghürids (1100-1206) were unable to dispense with Persian culture, though its vitality—measured by the number and importance of their poets and other writers at this time—was certainly not comparable to that in neighbouring territories to the west. The same is true of the Qara-Khitai. Thus from the cultural point of view the Saljuq era does represent
550



INTRODUCTION
one of the high-water marks of Iranian history and civilization. This cultural expansion is reflected in the development of the towns, in the founding of remarkable schools (Ni^amiyjas), not only in Baghdad but also in other important centres; in the transference of the admini strative machine from the hands of the old aristocratic families to those of a new middle-class intelligentsia; and also, as Bausani suggests, in the imponderable, if not always noticeable, influence of Isma'ilism. What novel and unprecedented developments might have taken place, had not the disastrous Mongol cataclysm occurred!1 Poetry also flourished during the period of the decline and fall of Saljuq rule, but the forms perfected by the old masters were already dying out and poetry was developing in an entirely new direction. Sana'i had pointed to such new ways during the first half of the sixth/ twelfth century. The panegyric ode (qanda) reached its greatest heights in the works of Anvari and Khaqani, because both these outstanding poets realized that the old paths could no longer be trodden and that the crisis would have to be resolved. Searching for fresh ideas and imagery, they saw a way out in the combination of poetic experience with erudition and refined rhetoric, in which—and this cannot be over emphasized—genuine poetry did not in any way suffer. This was the case with the great poets at least; with the lesser, however, virtuosity of technique tended to take the place of ideas. Their verses are more •suited to private reading, for in public recitation their deeper significance and refinement would vanish without a trace, as would all likelihood of any brilliant effect. The tradition of recitation was already dying out by the end of the Saljuq period. All this, together with increasing Arabicization, led in poetry to the " ' I r a q i " style and in prose to artificiality. From the social point of view the poets no longer stood on so high a pedestal as they had done previously. They faced each new day with fear, for the vast Saljuq empire was gradually disintegrating into states of varying sizes. Jealous of one another and easily bought for money, the poets were not treated with any great tenderness by the rulers, and thus it is common to find them languishing in prison or wandering from one court to another. They were compelled by the search for daily bread and their own prodigality to hunt for material rewards, and this in turn made begging, which even the most famous amongst them con doned, the most effective means of support for their poetic activity. Their distress was heightened by the universal sense of insecurity and the con

stant threat of invasion. Lamentations and vindictive or scornful verses provide a good barometer for measuring prevalent social conditions. This alone was enough to cause the qasida to lose its formerly privi leged position. Additional factors were a growth in the power of the towns, guilds, and bazaars, and an increasing antagonism to feudal overlords on the part of their tenants. This development found its ex pression in the increasing popularity of both the ghazal and the quatrain from the second half of the sixth/twelfth century on, with the ghazal gradually taking pride of place. The chaste language of these and other similar forms, compared with the exaggerated bombast of the qasidas, was a natural outcome of this change. The origin of the ghazal is some times traced back to the old independent song, and sometimes to the detachment of the purely lyrical exordia in the qasidas and their division into smaller units, singing being an essential feature in both cases. The poets took refuge in these forms when eulogistic verse could no longer provide sure hope of success. Süfism, particularly widespread in the nonfeudal layers of society, adopted the ghazal and the quatrain for its own ends. The strength of this movement grew in proportion to the econo mic and social distress of the empire, but was not confined only to certain well-defined social strata. Although it embraced more or less all poetry, it would be mistaken to assume that only with Süfism did poetry exist at all. Nevertheless Shibli Nucmäní is convinced that a ghazal un touched by Süfism is a rose without a scent.1 It is interesting to note that a definite nom de plume in the last line of a ghazal occurs a hundred years earlier in Süfi writings than in non-Süfi ghazals (sixth/twelfth century). Berteľs thinks that the earliest Süfi poets imitated the artisans with whom they were closely connected, whose practice it was to mark their products with their names, while Bausani and with him Ate§ see in the nom de plume the poet's own emotional self-exhortation.2 The artisans and their circles formed a secret society, the Futuwwa or "young men's association", closely linked to Süfism. A link between the Futuwwa and the Akhis^ & secret brotherhood existing in Asia Minor and Transcaucasia, is very probable.3 There is another poetic form that came strongly to the fore in the late Saljuq period. This was not the heroic epic, whose inappropriate subject matter and antiquated language did not permit it to continue into this period; it was the romantic epic. After 'Unsuri (and countless other

mathnavī writers), this form was to reach such perfection in the hands of Nizami (d. 605/1209) that he in turn became the model for all Iranian poets in subsequent centuries. The romantic tale, indeed even an early type of romantic epic, is known to have already existed in Middle Persian literature. It should not surprise us that something so pro foundly characteristic of Persia reappeared quite naturally in IslamicIranian culture, a fact which is confirmed by the Vīs u Rāmīn (an Iranian counterpart of the medieval European Tristan and Isolde epics), which existed in Pahlavi, probably in a Pāzand or Pārsi version, at least as a tale and, in the earliest N e w Persian period, as an epic. Rudāki (d. 329/ 940) also helped to keep the romantic tradition alive. A closer examina tion of this development reveals moreover that very many lines in mathnavis must have been taken from romantic epics.1 We know the titles of two such epics by 'Unsuri (d. 431/1039), and a considerable portion of a third (Vamiq u 'Adhra) has recently been discovered in India by Muhammad Shafic. Three survive in their entirety: 'Ayyuqi's Varqa u Gulshāh (early fifth/eleventh century), the Vīs u Rāmīn of Fakhr al-Din Gurgani (d. after 448/1039), and the Yusuf u Zalīkhā of Amani, written after 476/1083. The production of romantic epics cannot have ceased all of a sudden, although no titles, let alone actual texts, survive. The fact that so many echoes of Vīs u Rāmīn are discernible in Nizāmi suggests that he was indebted to the works of his predecessors, and these must therefore still have been extant. The preference for the didactic, ethical or Sufi epic undoubtedly sprang from the immorality and depression of the period; Sanā'ī was to become one of its greatest exponents. The weakening of Saljuq power led to the disintegration of the empire. Amongst the principalities which arose during the second half of the sixth/twelfth century, that of the Khwarazm-Shahs became increasingly powerful, since, apart from the personal energy of these rulers, the territory possessed numerous geographical and political advantages. The Khwarazm-Shahs were well on the way to restoring the Saljuq empire to the size it had enjoyed at its zenith, but there was to be a reversal whose effects on the whole Iranian world were truly tragic. The catastrophe came from the East. The fact that a clash occurred between the Khwarazm- Shāh and

Chingiz-Khän is insufficiently explained by the arrogant behaviour of the sultan: that would be too superficial a reason to account for events which were of the greatest historical importance. The clash became inevitable once Chingiz-Khän had unified Mongolia and consolidated its fighting power; indeed, since he depended on a feudalized nomadic aristocracy, he had to subordinate his policies to its requirements. The power of the Khwarazm-Shahs, on the other hand, as the spies of Chingiz-Khän soon found out, was by no means as solid as its expansion implied. The outcome of the struggle was thus already decided in advance. The Mongol invasion took place in two waves, beginning in 1219 under Chingiz-Khän himself, and continuing under the leader ship of the first Il-Khän Húlegú, who in 1256 broke the power of the Assassins and in 1258 destroyed Baghdad and the caliphate.1 Neither phase of the invasion touched the southern half of Iran; but the northern districts, including Khwärazm and Transoxiana, were struck with indescribable brutality. The invasion of course embraced a much vaster area, but here we are concerned only with the Mongol con quests in Iran and her neighbouring territories. The eastern Islamic areas in particular suffered greatly from this terror. The ruthless invaders massacred wholesale, destroying everything so as to instil fear and prevent counter-attack from behind. Indeed this catastrophe is one of the causes of Iran's subsequent backwardness. Not only the political but also the cultural development of the country was brought almost to a halt for many years to come, even though it cannot be denied that the concentration of such immense areas in the hands of the conquerors brought with it certain economic advantages. Under Húlegú (654-63/1256-65), the bounds of the Il-Khanid empire had been more or less definitely established. It was to become " a n essentially Iranian state which for the first time for many years incorporated the greater part of the Iranian people. The importance this had for the development of Persian civilization and for the con tinuation of Iranian culture is not to be under-estimated."2 Although the Il-Khäns (654-736/1256-1336) strove to make good the brutality of the conquerors, they were nevertheless foreigners in Iran. A shat tered economic system—these nomadic shepherds finding themselves in countries where feudalism was flourishing—was to remain with them until the end of the seventh/thirteenth century, when Ghazan

(694-703/1295-1304) attempted to carry out reforms: much too late, however, to preserve the power of the dynasty from its imminent dissolution. Nor could the conversion to Islam of the last rulers and the Mongol regiments help to avert this. T o the handfuls of survivors in the smouldering ruins, art could be of little consequence. Writers and scholars fled to take refuge in places less sorely smitten. That part of their cultural heritage which they could not take with them was doomed to destruction. Only the archives of the Assassins reached the hands of the historians after the destruction of the stronghold at Alamüt. The culture of the north-eastern provinces shifted to those of the south-west and elsewhere. This is why Jalàl al-Din Rümï was to appear in Saljuq Qonya, Sa'di in Shiraz, Amir Khusrau and 'Iraqi in India. When, under Hülegü, Tabriz was raised to the position of capital city, political and intellectual life moved away to this particular region, and Àzarbàijàn remained the heart of the empire for eighty years. The 'Iraqi style becomes predominant at this time, and the first signs of the Indian style begin to appear. If the old qasida lost its former eminence, this was for the reasons usually given, namely, that there were no great Iranians left, and that, to begin with, the Mongols could not understand Persian. At all events the Il-Khans themselves produced not a single poet or prose writer,1 and their courts displayed not the slightest interest in poetry. Moreover under the Mongols there was a new growth of towns, for which the panegyric ode had no appeal. The ghazal and the mathnavi were the forms in which their interests could be expressed. The distress of the towns was by no means slight; disturbances and oppressions continued, encouraging the retreat into Süfism. This suffering expressed itself in the mystical and didactic qasida2 (as opposed to the purely panegyric ode), and even more in the short ghazal, which reached its greatest perfection in the hands first of Sa'di and later of Hafiz. The long mystical poem reached its cul mination in these years ('Attar, Maulavi); versified teachings of the Sufi system now made their appearance; and the influence of Süfism became altogether more evident. These phenomena clearly demonstrate an at tempt to escape from a horrible reality. The Il-Khans showed interest in

learning only in so far as they were able to appreciate it. Hülegü founded an observatory, entrusting it to his favourite and counsellor Naşir alDin Tüsi (5 97-672/1200-74). Since the reason for its erection lay not in any interest in science but solely in astrological superstition, the fact that the Persian scholars used it for genuine astronomical research deserves all the more credit. Another subject which flourished during this period, reaching unprecedented heights, was historiography, for Chingiz-Khan and the Il-Khâns were intent on immortalizing their deeds and the fame of the Mongols. The Mongols slaughtered far too much of the population of Persia and destroyed too much of its economic structure and cultural heritage, for the catastrophe they had caused not to leave permanent scars. In this account the poets, the real essence of N e w Persian literature, take up the first and by far the largest portion of our interest, while the second, much smaller portion deals with the prose writers. The poets themselves will be examined in chronological order, less as individuals than as members of groups which emerge quite naturally. The im portance of mysticism will make it necessary to devote a special section to its main representatives. Since panegyric poetry had been all-im portant until the Mongol period (its chief mode being the qasida), it forms a magnificent gateway through which to enter upon a detailed study of N e w Persian literature. Nevertheless, special circumstances require that an exception be made at the start.
SANA'I
Sana'i is a poet on whom little research has been done.1 Only the last phase of his life and work comes within the scope of this study, and both are unfortunately hidden in great obscurity. The dates variously given for his death are as much as seventy years apart (5 20-90/1126-94), and the discrepancy between the dates for his last poem is eleven years (5 24-3 5/1129-41). More important is the question: can he be regarded as an adherent of tasavvuf or not ? In their appreciation of him, West and East diverge greatly. Nonetheless the significance and lasting influence of Sana'i as a poet were so great that it would be impossible to omit him from this survey. Hakim (" the scholar") Abu'l-Majd Majdud b. Adam Sana'i was born

SANA'I
about 473/1080-81 in Ghazna, where he spent his youth. He had already begun to write poetry during the rule of the Ghaznavid Abu Sa'id Mas'ud (492-508/1099-1115), but was not to remain a writer of panegyrics for long. A profound psychological upheaval made him turn to the opposite extreme. Legend attributes this to a quarrel picked with him by a madman, who accused him of the rankest heresy for his praise of rulers. This horrible experience—which was probably what led him later to undertake a pilgrimage to the holy places of Islam—occurred around 1105 during his sojourn at Balkh, where he wrote the satirical poem, Kdr-Ndma-i Balkh, " T h e Book of the Deeds of Balkh". His life after his return to Balkh was interrupted by journeys to Khurasan and Khwarazm, until he reappeared at his birth place around 518/1124-2 5. But not even the entreaties of Bahrain-Shah (510-52/1117-57) could induce him to return to the court. Nevertheless it was to Bahram-Shah that he dedicated his last and most celebrated work, the mathnavi Hadiqat al-haqiqa ( " T h e Garden of Truth"), and because of this he was accused of an heretical desire for innovation and had to beg for an edict of purification from Baghdad. He was then already seriously ill, and died immediately after the completion of the poem. The complications do not end here, however. Whereas Persian scholars are at pains to present Shi'ism as the poet's creed, Sana'i's qasida on Abu. Hanifa points instead to Sunnism, even though the tenor of his utterances regarding the family of the Prophet is clearly sympathetic. Tradition insists that he was a disciple of Shaikh Yusuf Hamadani, and European orientalists, too, accept his tasavvuf, and even see him as one of the most typical of the mystic poets. This is contrary to the most recent view, that of Y . E. Bertel's, who concedes at most a small degree of mysticism, while emphasizing all the more Sana'i's critical, didactic, and ascetic (though not Sufi) tendencies. Even when items of doubtful authorship are excluded, Sana'i's works consist of a whole series of mathnavis and an extensive divan. The shorter mathnavis are generally grouped among the so-called " Six of Sana'i", the best-known being the Sair al-ibdd ila 'l-ma'dd (" The Pilgrimage of the Servants of God to the Place of the Return "), a poem the theme of which is in some ways reminiscent of Dante's Divine Comedyľ, especially the Inferno. Moreover this theme had already occurred in the Middle Persian Artdk Vird^ Ndmak ( " T h e Book of Artak Viraz"), and in Avicenna's, that is Ibn Tufail's, Hqyj ibn Yaq^atu

" T h e Garden of T r u t h " (sometimes also called the Ildhl-Ndma, " The Divine Book ") overshadows all Sana'i's mathnavis—both in length (according to its author it has 10,000 lines, but 12,000 would be more correct); and also in importance, not only for its own sake, but for the further development of this type of mathnavi, as it is the first to be so long and to contain parables. Sana'i began his magnum opus in 524/ 1129-30 and finished it eleven years later at the age of 60, immediately before his death. The Hadlqa consists of ten chapters, each with a different title, arranged in different orders in different manuscripts; the content of the chapters is heterogeneous. Most orientalists regard the Hadlqa as an " encyclopaedia of Sufism", whereas Bertel's prefers the description "encyclopaedia of all Sana'i's accumulated knowledge". He reminds us that the poet frequently speaks of asceticism but never of spiritual discipline {tariqat\ and that he never mentions the " w a y of the Sufis" by name. Bertel's concedes some mysticism only in the chapter on love. In so doing he comes into conflict with Western opinion, but this is less important than the fact that Oriental scholars are unanimous about the Sufi character of Sana'i's poetry. Moreover, with the exception of Bertel's, European orientalists do not recognize in Sana'I such exceptional qualities as do the Persian scholars, who show marked enthusiasm for him. Nizami's Makh^an al-asrdr ( " T h e Treasure-chamber of Secrets") and Khaqani's Tuhfat al'Irdqain (" The Gift from the two Iraqs") follow most closely in time on the great master's example. The description of night in Nizami's poem was obviously influenced by the Hadlqa. Y e t Sana'i's language distinguishes itself from that of others, and, unlike the older, simpler language, his delights in learned allusions. Another difficulty for a reader lies in his use of brachylogy. Thus it is comprehensible that the Sufis encountered difficulties when trying to gain instruction from the Hadlqa \ at the request of his pupils, Jalal al-Din Rumi ("Maulavi") is said to have decided to write his own mathnavi, whose revelation of truths was more accessible to them than the Hadlqa. Although the Hadlqa was one of Maulavi's models, the techniques of the two authors differ: the Hadlqa does not delight in anecdotes, whereas they are interwoven everywhere in Maulavi's work. Sana'I was also one of the first to make the ghazal a medium for mysti cal ruminations; and in doing so, he provided an example for succeed ing generations. Many of his ghazals cannot fail to move the reader. The anacreontic manner is present, and there are outspoken attacks on



SANA' ī
poetry written for mercenary motives, as well as severe judgments on contemporary life in all its aspects (and on the Turks too); the poet refrains neither from invective nor from obscenity. But his real significance lies in his effective, far-reaching introduction of an ascetic and mystic attitude as an ingredient of the didactic mathnavi of varying length (Nāsir-i Khusrau, d. 465-10/1072-77, had already introduced philosophic ideas into poetry). Sanā'i led poetry away from simple and mundane things to spheres more elevated and intellectually more ambitious; in doing so he became a great innovator. Particularly notable is his social message that all Moslems are equal.
THE PANEGYRIC POETS

Shihāb al-Din 'Am'aq of Bukhara served the Qarakhanids in Samarqand, and, being an outstanding poet, was honoured with the title "Prince of Poetry". 'Am'aq enjoyed the highest esteem and favour at court, acquired great wealth, and insisted that other poets should revere him. He was a man of culture and had a thorough command of all the devices of rhetoric; in one of his qasidas he worked the words mūi u mūr "the hair and the a n t " into every half-line, a unique feat indeed! But he was too good a poet to be guilty of the barrenness of mere artificiality. His similes are tender and heartfelt, whether founded on fancy, reason or reality. Only one line seems to have survived from his epic Yusuf and Zalīkhā, and this is no less intricate since it can be scanned in two metres—the reason, no doubt, for the loss of the epic.1 He died in 542-43 /1147-49 at the age, it is said, of 100, and in the loneli ness which elderly court poets, superseded by younger rivals, knew only too well. 'Abd al-Vasi' Jabali of Ģharchistān, born about 555/1160, sang the praises of various contemporary dynasties. He is noteworthy as the precursor of a stylistic change that was to dominate the sixth/twelfth century: this consisted of a more frequent use of the colloquial language by cultured people, together with an increased number of Arabic expressions. He had a predilection for rhetorical ornaments, in particular for the figure laff u nashr (chiasmus). His divan of animal names is a real treasury of information. More important as a prose writer than as a poet is Rashid al-Din

Muhammad 'Umari (meaning " a descendant of Caliph U'mar"), usually called Rashid-i Vatvāt ("the Bat"), because he was a small, unprepossessing man with a bald head.1 He was born at Balkh in 508-09/1114-16,2 and died either in 578/1182-83 or, more probably, five years earlier. After acquiring an excellent education in his home town and in Khwarazm, he became the most outstanding stylist in Persian and Arabic in the court of the Khwarazm-Shāh Atsiz and his successors. Although he was often out of favour, Rashid was constantly in the shah's entourage. His poetic sphere was naturally that of Persian and Arabic court poetry. Rhetorical ornaments came easily to a man who wrote an excellent guide to poetry; in handling these ornaments he was a master. In his works there is therefore little place for feelings, although, as the impressive qasida on the visit of his beloved old mother shows, he was capable of capturing the right tone when occasion demanded. Elsewhere all the fireworks of rhetorical figures and tropes, all the ingenuity of language and form, are unable to conceal the coldness of feeling in his poems. The poet had to devote much attention to the description of martial events which he witnessed, and many of these descriptions are certainly very good. Rashid's rhetorical talent was greatly, if not unanimously, admired: a master such as Khāgāni placed it below that of Adib Sābir. Rashid cultivated lively relations with the literary world, and in this he was helped considerably by his high position as a court dignitary, since it made those more or less close to him seek his favour unless political antagonisms forced them to do otherwise. This was the case, for instance, in his relations with Adib Sābir, a poet at the hostile court of Sanjar. Political hostility does not account for every such breach, however. Rashid was a self-satisfied and arrogant man, full of personal sympathies and antipathies, fond of criticizing others. Those poets who listened to his advice and gave way to his suggested alterations to their poems, enjoyed his favour even to the extent of being invited to live with him. In such cases Rashid could be generous in material ways also. His relationship to Khāgāni is interesting: it began with expressions of mutual praise, short-lived however, since Khāgāni suspected Rashid of obstructing his access to the court of the Khwārazm-Shāh. Rashid possessed a large library, collected manuscripts and compared variants. A strict Sunni, he condemned all philosophers.

Rashid's prose is particularly valuable. Pride of place goes to his " A r t of Rhetoric", the Hada'iq al-sihr fi daqďiq al֊shťr, or " M a g i c Gardens of the Niceties of Poetry", written because Muhammad b. ťUmar Raduyani's Tarjuman al-Baldgha, " G u i d e to Eloquence" (com posed between 481/1088 and 507/1114) had become out of date. In Rashid's book almost thirty Persian poets are represented by examples, ťUnsuri in particular; amongst the Arab poets, Mutanabbi is most often cited. Sana'i and Firdausi are, in Rashid's eyes, non-existent, and he never mentions his own contemporaries.1 Nevertheless this is a valuable book, though its artificiality was probably an unfortunate influence on the development of Persian poetry. It was followed by a host of imitations. Apart from his Persian works, there is also a collection of Rashid's Arabic writings. Outstanding examples of his prose are the collections of his Persian and Arabic letters, both official and private: it is in these and in his poetics that his real significance can be seen. A particularly arresting and indeed welcome exception in the grey monotony of more or less well-known panegyric poets is the satirist Hakim ("The wise") Shams al-Din Muhammad b. 'All (or possibly Mas'ud), of Samarqand or its vicinity, who according to his own claim was a scion of the family of Salman, the Persian companion of the Prophet. He was generally known as Suzani, the " needlemaker " , a nom de plume said to have arisen because of his violent passion for a needlemaker's apprentice under whose influence he supposedly took up the twin crafts of needlemaking and poetry; this seems, however, a clumsy explanation when the relevance of "nomen o m e n " is so obvious. Details of his life (he died in 562/1166) are lacking, apart from what we can gather from his works. Obviously he was a very cultured writer: he took a knowledge of Arabic for granted. Countless allusions of his, and what seem to us now his extremely interesting quotations, lead to the conclusion that he was remarkably well read, and that his knowledge of Christianity and Manichaeism was exceptional, while his frequent use of Turkish words shows how widely known that language was. When he alludes to situations in everyday life, his level of meaning is often obscure—a problem which arises often enough with literary figures. In order, apparently, to make his livelihood, he addressed eulogistic verses to greater and lesser rulers, though he himself probably never left

Samarqand. Despite all their rhetorical erudition, however, these panegyrics show a general poverty of language. His qasidas are hardly likely to have aroused much admiration for him, in contrast with the fontaines lumineuses of the court poets, even if those to whom they were addressed could scarcely understand them. But their delight in Sudani's broad and non-literary humour must have been all the more sponta neous and unfeigned. He never hesitated to include lewd and insulting remarks, travesties and parodies, in his satire, for which he had many a down-to-earth metaphor and turn of phrase. He possessed unmistak able poetic talent, but too often lacked all sense of good taste. Neverthe less Suzani was a genuinely realistic poet, worthy of the most thorough study.
(ii) Gha^navid
A somewhat later poet, hitherto less well known, is Sayyid Ashraf alDin Abu. Muhammad Hasan b. Muhammad Husaini Ghaznavi, called Ashraf for short. His poetic career began towards the end of the fifth/ eleventh century under the Ghaznavids. He was active for a long time at the court of Bahram-Shah, where he enjoyed the favour and esteem both of the ruler and the viziers. After 543/1148 his life became less peaceful; harassed, he made his way through Khurasan and "Iraq to Baghdad and Mecca, singing the praises of minor Saljuq princes and of the great Sultan Sanjar. He died suddenly in 5 5 6/1160-61 on the way from Hamadan to Khurasan, in Azadvar, where his grave can still be seen. His divan, which contains inter alia eighty-three ghazals, is particularly significant for the development of this form. Occasionally signed with the pseudonym " Hasan", and essentially lyric in manner, his ghazals frequently contain eulogies of Bahram-Shah, often just in the final lines. In his qasidas the panegyric manner alternates with the didactic. Although not impervious to the influence of his predecessors and contemporaries, he possessed a voice original and strong enough to influence poets of the latter half of the sixth/twelfth century. Simplicity and lucidity are not the least of his merits.
(iii) Saljuq
It is well known that poets of the Saljuq period went from court to court in search of better conditions; there is nothing surprising in this. But at the same time they could also have other motives for so doing.

THE PANEGYRIC POETS
A case in point is a man who was made to suffer for a mode of conduct that happened not to be spontaneous but was enjoined on him. Shihab al-Din Adib Sabir b. Isma'il Tirmidhi, a panegyric poet at the court of Sultan Sanjar, was a fluent writer of conventional " love and wine " poetry; his sensitive verses are marked by the usual mannerisms, and by a predilection for certain rhetorical figures. But at heart he was a pessimist and probably for that reason a night-reveller. He imitated masters old and new and was in contact with the leading poets of his day; even Anvari regarded himself as insignificant in comparison with Tirmidhi. His exceptional knowledge of Arabic proves how highly educated he was; not only was he conversant with Arabic literature, he even translated Persian verse into Arabic. At the beginning of the hostilities between Sanjar and the Khwarazm-Shah Atsiz, he was despatched to the latter, ostensibly as an ambassador—as proof of the high regard in which he was held—but in reality as a spy. When he discovered Atsiz's plans to assassinate Sanjar, he was cruelly punished, being drowned in the Oxus (538/1143 or 542/1148). The qasida, flourishing generally throughout the twelfth century, reached its culmination in the works of two poets who were con temporaries of each other: Anvari of Khurasan and Khaqani of Caucasia, masters of a poetic genre particularly neglected and under estimated by Western scholars. Both were poets who outshone their predecessors, and whom their own followers could not surpass. Both were men not only of intellectual and poetic genius, of profound thought and wisdom, but of genuine feeling too. Erudition is the hall mark of their poetry, as is virulent invective. They wrote both qasidas and ghazals, and other slighter types of verse. But whereas Khaqani's works include an extensive mathnavi, tradition ascribes some didactic prose writings to Anvari. Since they both enjoyed considerable fame in their own lifetimes, it is all the more surprising that details concerning them are so deficient and distorted, in the case of Anvari perhaps even more than with Khaqani. Traditional biographies are full of attractive but unfortunately fictitious anecdotes which contain only grains of truth at most. Factual pictures of their lives could not be pieced together as long as reliable editions of their works were lacking. It is indeed fortunate that there has recently been an improvement in this respect. Anvari and Khaqani are amongst the most difficult poets to under stand; to do so requires the greatest philological, historical, and cultural penetration.

Anvarf s name and genealogy can be established with relative ease and accuracy: they are Auhad al-Din cAli b. Vahid al-Din Muhammad b. Ishäq Abivardi. He was born in the village of Badana, not far from the small town of Abivard (or Bävard), between Nasä and Sarakhs. Badana was situated in Dasht-i Khävarän, and therefore the poet is said to have signed his earliest poems with the name Khävari before assuming his well-known nom de plume of A nv a n . 1 A s is often the case in the bio graphies of early poets, the precise year of his birth is not known, but there is good reason for supposing it was 510/1116-17, since his first known qasida dates from 5 30/113.5-36. His father left him a modest fortune, which he soon squandered in riotous living. A tendency to drink, already apparent in his youth, was later to find expression in notorious passages in his qasidas where he begs for wine. He parried the reproaches of his friends in a probably unfinished mathnavi, the surviving torso of which shows that the author's propensity for invective was present in him from the start. He studied the customary sciences, in particular philosophy, mathematics, medicine, and astrology, and his works are permeated with a deep knowledge of them. Yet it was not to science and learning that he was to devote his life. A delightful anecdote tells us why he gave his preference to poetry; no doubt it is apocryphal, yet it has a core of truth: the prodigality of the court poets must have appeared attractive to a man of such unbridled inclinations. He did in fact make his way to the court of Sultan Sanjar, to whom he was undoubtedly akin in temperament, and there he became one of the ruler's intimates. He probably resided in the sultan's palace at Marv until the catastrophic Ghuzz invasion (548/1153-54). He then lived in Nishäpür and above all in Balkh. It was in Balkh that he underwent a disagree able experience, when some verses lampooning the city appeared. The inhabitants, deeply offended, threatened Anvari, supposing him to be the author. Even a long qasida, full of praises of Balkh, might not have been enough to placate them had he not been protected by respected worthies of the town who were also his friends. It was finally discovered that the lampoon had been foisted on him by Athir al-Din Futühi. Between 560 and 565 (1164-70) he visited Baghdad and Mosul. It cannot yet be established how long he spent there, but it is certain that after 5 68/1172-73 he was back in Balkh, where he presumably lived until his death.

One of the hardest problems in his biography is to establish the date of his death. If circulating rumours are sifted, we are left with a range of dates from 540 to 597 (1145-1201), a period of almost sixty years. The foremost Iranian scholars are working on the solution of this problem. One clue is offered by the conjunction of the seven planets, with Saturn in Libra, a celestial occurrence which was regarded by astrologers and especially by Anvari as the portent of a cataclysm of the first order. The terrified population of Balkh abandoned their homes and fled to the woods and mountains in the hope of finding some refuge there from the hurricane that was supposedly threatening, while on the critical day, 29 Jumādā II 582 (15 August 1186), the flame of the little lamp on the minaret did not even flicker. Events justified those who disagreed with Anvari, e.g. the poet Zahir Faryabi, and the resulting scorn must inevitably have injured Anvari's reputation. Embittered, he retired to complete solitude, writing nothing more, and died either in 583/1187-88, or, more probably, in 585/1189-90. Lyric poetry was completely reformed by this poet of genius. It might be added that he practised poetry in all its forms, though as a court poet he favoured the qasida. Though appreciating the masters of this style, he was well aware that it was static and inflexible in both form and expression, and he set about taking it apart and reshaping it. He did not regard its traditional sequence as sacrosanct, and was fond of begin ning with praise of the person to be eulogized and then passing on to another subject. The customary types of exordium vanish, their lyrical qualities being allowed to appear wherever they like. He does not attach any particular value to romantic feelings, not even in a dialogue between a lover and his beloved; amorousness is obviously not identical with passion, it conceals something else: it is directed at the person eulo gized. T o create lyrical episodes he had recourse either to descriptions of nature, in which he was most successful, or to philosophical reflexions. He was a master of description, be it of personal experiences (his crossing of the Oxus) or of public happenings (the catastrophe brought about by the Ghuzz, 548/1153). His language, too, departed from tradition. He could not help making use of the ornaments provided by poetics, and his command of the whole range of rhetoric was perfect; but here too he was in search of something new. He was no lover of trifling play with words and letters; instead he delighted in tropes, metaphors, similes, and allusions. He seldom, however, sacrificed a thought to a rhetorical embellishment.

Extreme elegance of first and last lines, of transitions, and of the in vocation is characteristic of him. His use of hyperbole, in which his thoughts and their effect are expressed to maximum advantage, is striking. So sovereign was his command of language—indeed he could improvise at a moment's notice—that he could express any idea with ease, though this does not mean that his ideas are immediately accessible to one and all. The stiff and antiquated language of his predecessors did not suit Anvari, and he used contemporary colloquial language, in particular the cultivated speech of the educated. This, together with his unusually comprehensive knowledge, drove him to replace the customary and hackneyed images with fresh ones drawn from the most varied fields of knowledge, as familiar to him as was poetry itself. This ushered in a wave of Arabicization such as had not hitherto occurred, though this does not mean that Anvari added an unnatural or in appropriate element to poetry. A n essential ingredient of Anvari's divan is the ghazal, which in his unique way he brought to a high degree of perfection—the highest perhaps until Sa'di. Nor could a man of his intellectual brilliance ignore the quatrain. But there was another genre which was particularly congenial to his easily excitable temperament, namely the "fragment" (qifa).1 This form gave poets the opportunity of treating their subject matter as freely as they wished; like other poetic forms, fragments allowed invocations and tokens of gratitude, but they also permitted attacks, and this was grist to Anvari's mill. While his qasidas and ghazals gleam with immaculate purity, his fragments were the ideal vehicle through which to work off his vanity, his sarcasm, his sense of injustice, and his petty jealousy of other poets. In them he incorporated his satires, or rather lampoons, for which he did not hesitate to use the coarsest, most scandalous expressions, whether his irritation was justi fied or not; for his sharp tongue spared no one, and indeed he some times hoped to incur his masters' favours by these means. He raised his voice against the stupidities prevalent at all levels of society, against sycophancy, against anomalies in administration; he satirized women, blind fate, and so on. Lampoons cannot fail to be personal, and para doxically their very subjectivity sheds a most informative light on society. Anvari's most likeable facet is his humour, found especially in his petitionary verse. Anvari's originality as a writer lies in his divan taken as a whole.

Y e t he was not only a great poet but a great scholar too, as is proved by the multitude of allusions in the divan. It is also known that he was an admirer of Avicenna's philosophy and that he knew Ghazaii's Destructio Philosophiae. When in Mosul he wrote a learned petition in honour of Qutb al-Din Maudüd and promised to write more. There are also reports of a commentary on astronomical tables and of an astrological work of his called Mufid, " T h e Useful O n e " ; but these writings have been lost, and only incomplete references to them survive. Anvari himself seems to have been a man fond of good living, merry to the point of licentiousness, and a great drinker of wine (indeed he once fell off a roof when intoxicated). In his petitionary verse he could be quite shamelessly importunate, though elsewhere he condemned begging as unworthy of poetry and the poet. Poetry itself he called unnecessary and worthless, though here he was obviously thinking of panegyric poetry. His inconsiderate delight in abusing others shows that he was irascible and easily hurt; on the other hand the discrepancy between the volume of his praise and the worth of its object was obvious enough to so perspicacious a man. Nevertheless he remained loyal to Sanjar and to the Saljuqs in general, even though the uncertainty of the times forced him to bestow praise on all kinds of people. His fluctuating attitude to various problems must be seen as a result both of the upheavals and dangers of the period, and of his exuberant talent and explosive, violent temperament. Eastern scholars are trying to discover which sect Anvari belonged to. Whereas in the past they would have liked to regard him as a Shi'i, it is now openly admitted by Iranian scholars that he was a Sunni. Anvari was not uninfluenced by his predecessors, in particular by Abu'l-Faraj Rüni, who probably died after 492/1098-99. Anvari was acquainted with the poetry of Khäqäni, and in his turn exerted a considerable influence on contemporary and subsequent poets. Zahir Färyäbi (d. 598/1201-02) adopted Anvari's manner to such an extent that later generations could not decide which poet to prefer. But the initiated opted, and quite rightly, for Anvari. N o w regarded as one of the greatest figures in Persian literature, he has been prevented from becoming universally known only because panegyric poetry is foreign to the West.



POETS AND PROSE WRITERS
THE AZARBAIJAN SCHOOL
Transcaucasia and its neighbour Azarbaijan provide a good example of an area which produced a homogeneous group of poets, each of whom nevertheless had his own characteristics. There are of course other examples (see, e.g., pp. 584-6); but literary history has not yet studied this aspect of Persian literature in sufficient detail. Although the great Saljuq rulers strove to bring this territory under the strong and centralized administration of their empire, they were unable to subdue the local feudal organization for long and to prevent its disintegration into independent principalities. The feudal conditions of Transcaucasia were very much closer to those of Europe than to those elsewhere in Iran. Its poetry is proof of its high degree of culture. Not only were there innumerable Caucasian and Azarbaijani writers and scholars, but they were especially original. Their modes of expression, their vocabulary, and their syntax contain certain features found seldom or not at all in the poets of eastern Iran. This does not mean that there were no con nexions between this school and the poets of the other parts of Iran. All these developments in poetry had sprung from the same roots, but had afterwards been subjected to local influences, in this case to the pro pinquity of non-Iranian and non-Muslim territories, whose languages were foreign or, at most, merely related to Persian. With the exception of Nizami's works, the entire poetic output of the region was confined to lyric poetry, to the qasida in particular. Moreover all these poets were employed by royal courts. Here, too, although there was no speci fically Sufi literature, the Sufi mask allowed poets to express opinions which would have been unthinkable in normal circumstances. Under the influence of Siifism, of the urban classes that is, the ghazal became very popular; and under the growing influence of the towns, themes were occasionally chosen from outside the courtly sphere. One of the striking features of the Transcaucasian school is its complicated tech nique. In their language the poets desisted from archaism, but drew all the more extensively from Arabic vocabularly. There are even traces of local folklore. The school, which began with Qatran (d. 465/1072), formed a welldefined group of teachers and pupils of whom two, Khaqani and Nizami, were to exert a lasting influence on the entire development of their respective genres: Khaqani being the greatest exponent of the

qasida and Nizami the most brilliant writer of romantic epics. Apart from the latter poet, all the others were attached to courts, even though Persian was not the language of the princes whose praises they sang. But these patrons should not be over-idealized; their moods, often arbitrary and hostile, and the possibility of their disfavour and of ensuing imprisonment were common perils for the poets. One result was that the court poets could not display a definite moral attitude. The first such poet was the courtier Nizam al-Din Abu'l-'Ala Ganjavi (d. 554/1159), the first notable figure of the school of Shirvan, a critic and teacher highly regarded by the generations after him. Little of his writing has survived. A n attempted comparison has already been made above (p. 563), and now it can be taken further. Khaqani and Anvari were undoubtedly great poets, and only their almost exclusive concentration on the panegyric seems to me to have prevented them from becoming known outside the bounds of Iranian culture. Khaqani's biography abounds with problems, though Anvari more than rivals him in this respect. The infusion of learning into poetry, a characteristic they shared with their times, contributed towards their greatness. Anvari was well acquainted with philosophy and acknowledged its place in his writings; Khaqani was no lover of it. They were well aware of the shady side of panegyric writing and often even expressed a disgust for poetry. Both, however, were excellent lyric poets, and the genuine feeling in their ghazals clearly points the way to Sa'di and Hafiz. Neither of them was pampered by life. The choleric Anvari inclined to laughter, while Khaqani sur veyed the world with a sombre gaze. Their sharp tongues gave them such a reputation that they almost came to grief, for each had certain invective poems falsely attributed to him; in spite of this, they each had to make atonement and beg for pardon. And in the end, both of them retired into solitude.
Of all the poets in this period, Afdal al-Din Badll (Ibrahim) b. 'Ali Khaqani of Shirvan (b. 515/1121-22) was most closely bound to his native country, Azarbaijan, and therefore his poetry cannot be under stood without a thorough knowledge of the political and cultural life of eastern Transcaucasia, a central meeting-point of Muslim and Christian religious influences. Khaqani remembers his. father, the cabinet maker cAli, but his deepest affection was for his mother, who had once been a Nestorian slave, and who, although she had embraced Islam, must certainly have taught her son the elements of the Christian

faith and its rites. Khâgâni, unlike the majority of Islamic Persian writers, was remarkably well informed on the subject of Christianity; he did not of course owe this knowledge solely to his mother, for the interest in religion prevailing amongst those around him had much to do with it. His divân abounds in images and symbols which are some times Christian, sometimes Muslim, both blended together; at times he also quotes from Christian prayers and sacred texts. A divân of this kind could not have been composed anywhere except in Transcaucasia. His youth was spent in poverty and distress, and nothing would have come of him, the child of an ordinary artisan family, had not his talent and quite exceptional sagacity attracted the attention of his uncle, the doctor Mirza Kâfi al-Din 'Umar b. 'Uthmân,1 a cultured man who himself taught the boy the rudiments of Arabic (Khâgâni was also to write Arabic qasidas). Then followed a thorough education in every branch of science, which left its mark on Khâgâni and his work. Ghazals and eulogies of the Prophet (na't), written under the mystical nom de plume of Hagâ'igi, " t h e searcher after truth", soon gave the young student the reputation amongst his companions of being a reasonably good poet; but the nacts of his maturity were to earn him the name of Hassan al-'Ajam, "the Persian Hassan". When the court poet Abu'l'Alâ Ganjavi (p. 5 69 above) took him as a disciple, he was so well pleased with him that he gave him his daughter's hand in marriage, and even presented him to the Shîrvân-Şhâh, who at that time was Abu'l-Muzaffar Khâgân-i Akbar Manûchihr b. Faridün. It seemed that Khâgâni (who had been led by these favourable auspices to reguest this pseudonym) had indeed succeeded. But his father-in-law soon became jealous, and this put an end to all the young poet's hopes: there could be no guestion of a career for him when cAli the cabinet-maker had sold his possessions to support his son and the latter's family. This was the actual background to the impassioned guarrel which broke out between the two poets, and which continued until Khâgâni accused Abu'l-'Alâ of sympathizing with the ideology of Hasan-i Şabbâh, the founder of the Assassins: an accusation of considerable gravity in the eyes of the Sunni prince. Khâgâni then tried to establish himself elsewhere, especially at the court of the famous KhwarazmShâh 'Ala' al-Din Atsiz, but this the poet Raşhid Vatvât (pp. 559 ff.) would not allow. T o Raşhid's friendly approach, Khâgâni replied with

an angry satire, and though he soon regretted his act, he did not im prove his relations with Rashid. When 'Umar the doctor, his " u n c l e " and teacher, died in 545/1150, Khaqani was filled with anchoretic yearnings, a mood that was to reappear later though he was able to indulge it at the end of his life. His attempt to reach the court of Sultan Sanjar failed; he had got only as far as Ray when the destruction of the Saljuq empire reduced all his hopes to naught. In 551-52/1156-57 he undertook his first pilgrimage to the holy places of Islam, a concession accorded him probably at the request of the Georgian king Dmitri I. One fruit of this pilgrimage was the Tuhfat al-Irdqain ( " T h e Gift from the T w o Iraqs " ) , the first book of travels in mathnavi form to be written in Persian. He met with a most unfriendly reception in Isfahan on his return journey: the city rose in indignation against him on account of an offensive and scandalous satire which had been foisted on him by Mujir Bailaqani. Khaqani was driven to appease the city with a long qasida meant to clear up the deceit. Shortly afterwards he was thrown into prison (554/1159), his laments finding utterance in the so-called "prison qasidas". The cause of this must be sought in the upheavals that followed the death of the Shirvan-Shah Manuchihr (5 54-57/115962), since Khaqani probably refused to support the shah's widow Tamara in her conception of the succession.
In Vil'chevsky's biography a definite clue to this event is furnished by a qasida written in 5 64/1168 and addressed to the Byzantine Emperor Manuel Comnenus (1143-80) rather than to the latter's nephew and rival Andronicus Comnenus.1 This qasida proves that Khaqani visited the court of the Emperor at Constantinople: in it he speaks of the religious controversy which was at that time engrossing Constantinople and Orthodox Christianity, namely, the interpretation of the words: " I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I " (John xiv. 28). Khaqani's interpretation concurred with the opinion of the Church Council, which had been influenced by Manuel to oppose Andronicus. Later, however, Khaqani showed a different attitude to Andronicus, when the latter, an exile, wandering from place to place with his consort Theodora, eventually arrived in Transcaucasia at the court of the Georgian king Giorgi III (1156-84). There Andronicus was greeted with all due pomp and took part in the allied campaign of Georgia and Shirvan to ward off the Russian attack on Transcaucasia in 569/1173. In one of his qasidas the poet offers Andronicus his services, describing

POETS AND PROSE WRITERS
572
him as the only man capable of defeating the Russian armies, and going so far as to call him the worthiest claimant to the Imperial throne, which in fact Andronicus never ceased to strive for. This complete reversal in Khaqani's attitude was caused not so much by Andronicus's hostility to Russia, as by the poet's own dissatisfaction with the court of Akhsitan and with Shirvan in general; this unhappiness was the reason for his never-ending attempts to break away. He was able to disguise his service to Andronicus by another pilgrimage (which was probably again brought about by the intercession of a member of the Byzantine Imperial family). Thus in 570/1175, entrusted with a political mission on behalf of Andronicus, he set out for Iraq; and he remained in Baghdad for some time, where, despite invitations, he refused to enter the service of the Caliph. Soon after his return to Shirvan he suffered the cruel blow of the death of his son Rashid al-Din (5 71/1176), and probably other misfortunes besides. His struggles to escape from his surroundings at Shirvan became increasingly desperate; yet each time his hopes were dashed. Although Akhsitan was by no means fond of him, he was reluctant to lose him. Finally Khaqani began to long for Khurasan, by then already under the dominion of the Khwarazm-Shah; he would willingly have established himself there, now that Rashid Vatvat was dead (573/1177-78). In 580/1184 he either went or fled to Tabriz, but never got any farther; from there he visited Baghdad and various other places, but Tabriz remained his principal place of resi dence. Many of the poems in his divan date from this period, but his activities, apart from writing poetry, remain obscure. While he was at Tabriz his wife died, in Shirvan, and he poured out his grief in eight elegies. After living in what seems to have been solitude, he died at Tabriz in 595/1199.
A comparison between ViPchevsky's biography of the poet and of the traditional native ones will reveal many discrepancies. In order to establish the truth, it is wiser to follow the example of various Iranian and Soviet scholars and rely on the evidence of Khaqani's divan itself, since it contains a host of autobiographical details. Conversely, we can appreciate the poetry fully only by continually bearing in mind the history and culture of the Muslim and Christian Caucasus, and by remembering Khaqani's ties with Constantinople. The poet provides some help in this, with allusions and frequent, although well hidden, chronograms. A speciality of Khaqani's (as of other poets of the Azarbaijan school, no doubt) is the double chronogram calculated

according to both the Hijri and the Julian calendars, though its presence is not immediately obvious. A good example occurs in the famous qasida on the ruins of Mada'in (Ctesiphon), a poem erroneously attri buted to the poet's second pilgrimage. That it was written instead in 561/1166 is clearly indicated by a double chronogram within it.1 Thus Khaqani did not write the qasida while bewailing the actual ruins of the celebrated metropolis; he wrote it six years after his return from the pilgrimage and even used a similar qasida by the Arabic poet Buhturi (d. 284/897) as his model. There can be no question of any patriotic feelings or of any echoes of Iranian national ideals in Khaqani7s qasida; rather, it is a beautiful variation of the usual lament on the transitoriness of worldly things. Within his divan, every description of Khaqani's life shows the unrest in which he lived. The poet was continually complaining and lamenting. This was not the fault of his milieu only; its moral standards were by no means high, but he too was to blame for his sufferings. Nor can it be maintained that he never accepted any gifts or emoluments from the Shirvan-Shahs. Nevertheless he was always convinced that he was being treated unjustly, and because of this he was continually fleeing from place to place in search of something better. He was a poet of genius, but a man of boundless conceit and always apt to take offence. This is the key to the correct understanding of his inconsistent behaviour. Khaqani was a panegyric poet, though not quite in the usual sense; he was not just a poetic craftsman, but a genuine poet of an exceptional and brilliant kind. Outwardly his writing is beset with innumerable difficulties, so that it yields its treasures to few, and then only with the help of the numerous commentaries which this peculiarity has rendered necessary. A man of outstanding learning, he made use of every detail that contemporary knowledge could offer, displaying them all with the fireworks of his rhetorical virtuosity. In both science and poetry he was in his element; but as he was first and foremost a poet, science had to be the servant of his poetry. The nature of the difficulties which encompass it is a result of this; they stem not from any desire to dazzle and impress nor from any superficial delight in artificiality, but from his intellectual richness: Khaqani presupposes like-minded readers. These difficulties are present in his panegyric verse and in his more heartfelt passagesin his powerful and moving laments and elegies on the deaths of his

son and wife, for instance, and on the murder of a scholar during the Ghuzz incursion; they are present when he meditates on the transience of the things of this world in the qasida on the ruins of Ctesiphon, when he is suffering from jealousy, lack of friends, betrayal, and imprison ment. Particularly magnificent are his descriptions of landscapes and of nature, of morning and sunrise in particular; here, as in other passages, we sense the beauty of his Caucasian homeland. N o r is love entirely absent, though its presence is rare. The manifestation of Allah as the Beloved is a concept quite foreign to him. In his panegyric verse, which often rises to tones of the most exaggerated adulation, his purpose is not just empty praise, for he also imparts instruction and advice. At the same time, his ability to attack and to slander is equally remarkable. His enthusiasm is for religious and especially Sufi wisdom, rather than for anything philosophical. In his originality he reveals affinities with the poets of Azarbaijan and 'Iraq, but his qasidas, as he himself admitted, reflect the direct influence of Sana'i. He knew, admired, and imitated the great poets of Khurasan, such as Manuchihri, and he strove to surpass 'Unsuri in ornamentation. He used the ghazal both for the expression of its customary themes and for its laments. A master of language, a poet of sense and sensibility, constantly inclining towards introspection, and a man of unique personality; with such qualities Khaqani is assured of a place in the front ranks of Persian literature. (This being so, the praise he consciously and not in frequently bestows upon himself does not sound hollow.) He reveals the heights to which the qasida can aspire in the hands of a genius. Unfortunately the art of the qasida is in all respects esoteric. Khaqani exerted an incalculable influence on the entire subsequent development of panegyric poetry. His qasida on Ctesiphon even influenced the " Ode on the Kremlin" by the modern poet Lahuti (d. 1957). It is also likely that Maulavi adopted the form of Khaqani's exordia and ghazals for many of his own ghazals; on the other hand the picaresque tone of some of his poems is reminiscent of Hafiz two hundred years later. This picture of Khaqani would not be complete without further mention of his Tuhfat al-Irdqain^ " T h e Gift from the T w o Iraqs" (i.e. from Persian and Arabian Iraq), the author's poetic description of his first pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. The title was not his original one, since he himself calls the work Tuhfat al-khawdtir va %ubdat aldamd'ir, " The Gift made up of Memories and a Selection of Thoughts ". The work is immediately remarkable because it has nothing in common

with any other existing mathnavi; nor can it be described as a con tinuous travel narrative, because the author constantly interrupts it with digressions. In fact, it is an Oriental counterpart to Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. A t the very beginning Khaqani apostrophizes the sun, and during the course of the poem he repeatedly alludes to it on all manner of occasions and in its most diverse aspects. In six cantos of varying length, he treats of places and important people, of nature, events, traditions, and customs, and of his own life and family. His style varies from description to direct address and dialogues, of which one of the most striking is a long conversation with the prophet Khidr. The poet praises and laments, but he also inveighs against people (not sparing his own father-in-law). Yet even this does not complete the picture of Khaqani, for the man's real thoughts and feelings are not to be found in his eulogies any more than in his invectives. Rather, it is in many lesser-known qasidaseither messages to, or laments for, relatives and friends, for artisans, stallkeepers, poets, and other simple folk in Shirvan: works written not for hope of reward but out of sincerity of heart, and thus permeated with deep feeling for their respective heroes—it is in these qasidas, together with his intimate, essentially lyrical ghazals and quatrains, and finally in his "Fragments", where he often expresses the purest and most lofty humanism, that Khaqani translated into superlative poetry the thoughts and ideals of an oriental town in the Middle Ages, thus preserving them for posterity.
Khaqani's disciple and his rival in courtship was Abu'l-Nizam Muhammad Falaki Shirvani, a native of Shamakhi (b. 501/1107, d. 549-51/1154-5 7). Calligrapher, Arabic scholar, and mathematician, he was also well versed in astronomy and therefore surnamed Falaki, meaning both "heavenly" and "ill-starred"; indeed he is said to have written a book on astronomy. It is strange that Falaki does not seem to have thought any contemporary poet worthy of mention; instead he regarded himself as the equal of Abu. Tammam (d. 230/846) and of Abu. Nuwas (d. 198/810). He spent his whole life at the court of the famous Shirvan-Shah Manuchihr II b. Faridun, and, unlike the other poets, praised only his master in his finely wrought qasidas. Y e t he too, like Khaqani, Mujir, and probably Abu'l-'Ala, was thrown into prison as a result of the calumny of rivals, an experience which had a deep effect on him. O f his poetic works some 1,512 scattered lines have survived, and

they are relatively simple, even when they touch on science. He generally includes essentially lyrical passages, on wine and the beloved, at the end of a qasida. He admires neither bigotry nor boastfulness. From prison he spoke as a true poet; but originality was never his most salient feature. Nevertheless 'Ismat Bukhara'! (d. 829/1425-26) imitated him, as did Salman Savaji (see p. 613), though the latter did not acknowledge his model. Another of Khaqani's pupils was Abu'l-Makarim Mujir al-Din of Bailaqan (part of Shirvan), an excellent though pugnacious poet: in fact after his apprenticeship he became an enemy who attacked the master in a lampoon. Virtually nothing is known of his life except that he came of a family in no way distinguished and that his mother was an Abyssinian. In his qasidas he extolled amongst others the atabegs of Azarbaij an (Eldigiizids) and the Salj uq sultan Arslan b. Toghril. His relations with these, alternating between favour and disgrace, between fame in the eyes of the envious and public ignominy, indeed imprisonment, cannot be described here. Mujir's divan is impressive because of its good taste, the harmony of its language, and its lucidity, simplicity, and forceful impact (indeed Amir Khusrau Dihlavi preferred it to Khaqani's); he is at his best when imitating old masters, rather than his own teacher. He was not inclined to display his knowledge, either literary or scientific, in his verse, and had no great understanding of philosophy; his mysticism was nothing more than superficial asceticism and pessimism. His lampoon on Isfahan (written because of allegedly inadequate hospitality) caused much suffering for Khaqani, who was taken to be the author. It was in Isfahan that Mujir died in about 594/1197-98, though whether by natural causes is not known.
T o the same group as Khaqani and the Azarbaijan poets connected with him belongs Athir al-Din Abu'1-Fadl Muhammad b. Tahir (d. 577/1181 or 579/1183-84), a native of the distant town of Akhsikat, in Farghana; his pseudonym was Athir or Athir-i Akhsikat. His earliest works date from before the time he left his home for the west, following the brutal Ghuzz incursion. In Azarbaijan he entered the service of the Eldigiizids and acquired a brilliant literary reputation. His panegyric qasidas are very much in the manner of Khaqani, with whom, as with Mujir, he maintained relations. He could not, however, restrain himself from attacking them both. An egotist, he loved himself most, while regarding Khaqani as his equal and honouring Mujir with the epithet "Robber of the caravans of poetry". His ghazals and quatrains are

worthy of attention, and certainly his ingenuity of content and form cannot be denied; but this is counterbalanced by the frequent obscurity resulting from his erudite manner. Born about 5 5 I/I156 in Fâryâb (to the south-west of Balkh), Zahir al-Din Tâbir b. Muhammad, who wrote under the name Zahir, came of a learned family. That he was probably of Turkish origin, or brought up in Turkish surroundings, would account for the large proportion of Turkish words in his divan. When Anvari and his supporters made their prophecy, that a catastrophic hurricane would occur in 582/1186, Zahir was amongst those who disputed its accuracy, and in doing so he aroused the enmity of Toghan-Shâh b. Mu'ayyad. He then betook himself to Isfahan and from there to Mâzandarân and Âzarbâîjân, praising a whole series of patrons on the way. He dedicated the majority of his panegyric qasidas to Nuşrat al-Din Abü Bakr Eldigüz, the atabeg of Âzarbâîjân and 'Iraq (5 87-607/1191-1211), though at this court he was not immune from the animosities created by intrigues. He finally came to prefer seclusion in Tabriz, where he died at the age of forty-seven. Zahir was unashamedly a writer of panegyrics, a follower of Khâgâni and Anvari, both of whom he surpassed in exaggerated adulation, though he lacked their emotional depth, not to mention their genius. He was an obsequious man whose begging was in the worst taste; but cupidity was a feature of the period. He despatched poems of praise far and near, in Arabic as well as Persian. In his conceit he criticized Anvari, Nizami, and others, because he regarded no one as his equal, though he himself did not write any satires. But he did undoubtedly possess certain poetic gifts, which must have enabled him to exert a considerable in fluence, since later generations were undecided whether to give prefer ence to him or to Anvari, whom he in fact imitated. Their indecision was sadly misplaced, it is true, for Zahir was far from being a great poet; in the eyes of his contemporaries his chief merit lay in the relative comprehensibility of his verse. The reading of his divân presupposes a good knowledge of the troubled age in which he lived. The praise which Hâfiz bestows on him is for a line falsely attributed to him. However, Sa'di himself imitated Zahir's lyrical preambles.
The romanticism of Nizami may be identified with a conception of humanity of the most sublime kind. What a difference there is between this conception and the sober utilitarianism of Sa'di! Nizâmı comes

first not only as a socially conscious philosopher but also as a psycho logist, a story-teller, a verbal artist, and a rhetorical virtuoso. A s the scene of the greatest flowering of the panegyrical qasida, southern Caucasia occupies a prominent place in New Persian literary history. But this region also gave to the world Persia's finest creator of romantic epics. Hakim Jamâl al-Din Abü Muhammad Ilyâs b. Yûsuf b. Zaki b. Mu'ayyad Nizami, a native of Ganja in Azarbaijan, is an un rivalled master of thoughts and words, a poet whose freshness and vigour all the succeeding centuries have been unable to dull. Little is known of his life, the only source being his own works, which in many cases provide no reliable information. We can only deduce that he was born between 535 and 540 (1140-46) and that his background was urban. Modern Azarbaijan is exceedingly proud of its world-famous son and insists that he was not just a native of the region, but that he came of its own Turkish stock. A t all events his mother was of Iranian origin, the poet himself calling her Ra'isa and describing her as Kurdish. The only fact known about his youth is that he was orphaned early. It can be assumed that his family was relatively wealthy, for otherwise he could scarcely have enjoyed that excellent education in all the known branches of science and learning which his works so incontestably reveal. His native Ganja seems to have cast a spell on him: he left its walls only once, in 581 or 582 (1185-87), and then against his will: when the ruler of Azarbaijan, Qizil-Arslan, who was on a progress some thirty farsakhs (117 miles) away, expressly requested to meet him. Did Nizamî make his living from poetry alone ? Was poetry his only source of livelihood ? A n answer of a kind is to be found in՝Lailiu Majnun, an epic of over 4,000 lines which Nizami conjured up in less than four months; there he says that he might have been able to complete it in a fortnight had it not been for another occupation.1 If he visited royal courts in his early years, he soon abandoned the practice; he was no court sycophant, indeed his whole way of thinking was against it. He did dedicate his great epics as well as occasional ghazals to princes; but it was then customary to do so in the hope of some reward or, rather, fee. Bahrâm-Shâh, in return for the dedication of the epic Makh^an al-asrâr^ sent him 5,000 dinars and five nimble mules. Nizâmi's reward for Khusrau u Shmn (he was given the village of Hamdüniyân) seems to have been less satisfactory, for it was made fun of by one of his rivals. It may therefore be justifiably deduced that he did not enjoy an excess of worldly goods. Tradition

associates him with certain of the Akhis, a kind of masonic society o f the period, which recruited its supporters not from high-ranking circles but rather from the artisan classes. He was not an adherent of Süfism. 599/1203 has generally been taken to be the year of his death, but the chronology of the persons he praised points to a later date, the most credible being that inscribed on an old gravestone, namely 605/1209, though the inscription itself contains a mistake and is therefore not entirely trustworthy. People have for centuries made pilgrimages to Nizami's mausoleum as though to the burial-place of a saint; it has now been lovingly restored. Nizàmi's epics consist of five independent poems, each with its own metre which were only later grouped together in a collection known as the Khamsa or " Q u i n t e t " . In the first poem, Makh^an al~asrar, " T h e Treasure-Chamber of Secrets", the topical allusions are dated, but a difficult and still unsolved problem arises. The earliest manuscripts of the epic give three different dates for its completion. These are ap parently approximate only, and unfortunately happen to be metrically interchangeable. However, on the basis of various other allusions, the year 570/1174-75, when Nizami was approximately thirty-five, appears the most likely one for its completion. Unlike all his other epics, this poem has an ethical and philosophical content, though Sufi symbolism is apparent only in the introductory passage concerning the heart. He does not avoid criticism of the rulers and of their system, he defends the rights of the ordinary man, and holds up truth as a categorical impera tive. As regards its content, Nizami's work has a precursor in Sana'fs Hadtqa, but both in metre and in the clear-cut organization of the poem, he went his own way: his desire was, as he proudly announced, to stand on his own feet. The introduction is made up of eulogies of G o d and of the Prophet; a description of the latter's ascent into heaven in the space of a second; a eulogy of Bahràm-Shàh; a description of the poem's genesis, and a passage in praise of words and poetry: in other words, a series of passages of the kind which later occur regularly in every con ceivable epic. Each of the poem's twenty chapters has a theoretical introduction and an illustration in the form of a parable, which often refers only to the last idea in the introduction, while at the same time forming a transition to the next chapter. The mastery with which the poet handles the theoretical reflexions and then devises appropriate parables must be particularly emphasized. The subject matter itself is not easily digestible; but the perfect way in which such intractable

material is adapted proves the greatness of Nizami. There is no trace of the diffuseness characteristic of Sanâ'i; the poetry is drawn from the living language, yet this remains Nizâmi's most difficult work. The repercussions of the poem on Persian literature were extremely far-reaching and made themselves felt on the literature of neighbouring countries also. Indeed the fame wThich Nizami acquired with Makh^an al-asrdr spread so far that the ruler of Darband, though the poem was not dedicated to him, expressed his admiration with the gift of a Qipchaq slave girl called Afaq (i.e. "Blanca"), whose beauty obviously must have captivated the poet, since he married her in 569/1173-74. Their happy union was blessed with a son to whom Nizami repeatedly refers in his works, but unfortunately in 1180 her death put an end to their happiness.1 When the 'Iraqi Saljuq Toghril II requested a love epic from the poet without specifying the subject further, Nizami picked on the story of the lovers Khusrau and Shirin, a theme set in his own region and based at least partly on historical fact, though an aura of legend already surrounded it. Nizami completed the work in feverish activity after Afaq's death (c. 576/1181), with Shirin and Afaq, two figures of the utmost purity, blending into one in his imagination. The poem is really a romance of the love and suffering of a princess as a girl and then as a wife, and is unequalled for its pure beauty in the whole of Persian literature. Some of the events narrated in it were obviously suggested by the unworthiness of the ruling classes; the shah's vacil lation, for example, leads to an uprising of his vassals and the downfall of all the main characters. Nizami's motivation is psychological; his portrayal of character is brilliant. We have the constant Shirin and the vacillating Khusrau; her love shines with purity, his feelings spring from egotism. The episode of Farhâd stands out as an example of love sacrificing itself. The animal passion of the shâh's son Şhirüye is of the basest kind: in him the loose morality of a feudal lord is depicted in even worse light than it is in Khusrau. H o w much more noble, by comparison, is the labourer Farhâd!
The subject of the third epic, written in 584/1188, is not taken from Persian history but is borrowed from the Arabian world: not that of the Bedouins, but one closer to the Persian conception of Arabia. Lazlî u Majnün was composed at the request of the Shirvân-Shâh Akhsitan, and Nizami undertook its composition unwillingly, fearing

that the subject would prove too slight; for this reason he chose the shortest metre. The subject is in fact similar to that of Romeo and Juliet. It is an epic full of feeling and passion, and quite unlike the colourless Arabic sources on which Nizami drew. The drama of the story culmi nates in the casting off of the iron fetters, symbolic of a deliberate break with human society. Majnün ("Fool") lives only for the spiritual bond uniting him with Laili; this is why the external appearances seem not to change after the death of the husband she had been compelled to marry. The whole conception is entirely psychological without any trace of Süfism. Majnün has to suffer as a poet too, but grief enhances the passion of his songs. Bertel's has pointed out the didactic element concealed in the epic. On the one hand we have the exceptional mild ness of Majnün's father, on the other the unnatural tyranny of Laili's; and a third concept of fatherhood is apparent in the relationship of Nizämi to his son, which is expressed in the preamble to the poem. When in a special chapter the poet addresses the son of the ruler, it seems that he really has in mind the ruler himself, who, being a father, might be able to perceive the lesson of the tragic story which he had himself suggested for the epic.
It has been maintained that Laili u Majnün is inferior to the previous epic, but I do not share this opinion.1 In the development of plot and in emotional depth, not to mention language and rhetoric, it is certainly quite the other's equal. Moreover the exceptional number of imitations of it attest to its popularity, and although this has naturally decreased with the decline of feudalism, the theme of the epic still recurs today in Turkish and Persian novels. The fourth of Nizärni's epics in terms of chronology, but the first in merit, is the Haft Paikar, "Seven Pictures" (completed in 593/1197), whose elegant, graceful metre corresponds to the lighter nature of the poem. It is dedicated to the Aqsunqurid *Alä' al-Din Körp-Arslan, the Prince of Marägheh, who had commissioned it without specifying a theme. Its subject is the life of the Sassanian Emperor Bahräm V G ü r (420-38), a monarch less celebrated in history than in legend; in other words, it is taken once again from Iranian history. Bahräm is the central figure, but his story does not occupy the entire poem, more than half of it being made up of the seven delightful tales of the seven princesses whom Bahräm married, and these, taken together, amount to a second plot.

In the Haft Paikar the shah does not appear in the same light as the heroes of the Shah-Nam a or those portrayed by the followers of Firdausi. Bahram is made to correspond to the new conditions, as can be clearly seen if Firdausf s version is compared with Nizamfs. The attitude of the poet is obvious: he upholds the people against the misrule of the princes and potentates, and offers the latter a lesson cast in the most exquisite poetic form. In the tales of the seven princesses, Nizamfs narrative art reaches the highest degree of perfection he ever attained. The most varied aspects of love are brilliantly conveyed, always with a profound moral basis. In his description of passion, Nizami commands the whole range from the utmost delicacy to the most extreme violence. He avoids the make-believe of the fairy tale, transposing it into illusion and thus into subjective reality. His language is not antiquated; rather, it corresponds exactly to the times and provides an admirable vehicle for describing events and emotions. Nizamfs last epic is the Iskandar-Ndma, " T h e Lay of Alexander", or more properly Sharaf-Ndma, " B o o k of H o n o u r " and Iqbdl-Ndma, " B o o k of Fortune", which, if taken together, form his most extensive work. Its dating, however approximate, provides insuperable diffi culties, chiefly because the dates of Nizamfs death and of the accession of £Izz al-Din Mas'ud, the ruler of Mosul (1211-19) clash. The ShardfNdma can with some hesitation be ascribed to the years between 1196 and 1200, and the Iqbdl-Ndma to the years between 1200 and the poet's death (600/1203-605/1209?). Darab solves the problem by regarding the dedication to 'Izz al-Din Mas'ud as a later interpolation.1 These dates, however, are all extremely doubtful. A peculiarity of the epic is the apostrophization of the "cup-bearer" in the first part and of the " s i n g e r " in the second, as a prelude to each. Nizami took the material for the entire poem from Arabic and Persian chronicles, but certainly not from monographic sources. Desire for war and conquest is quite foreign to his Iskandar; he fights and conquers only when obliged to do so or when helping others. He ap pears first as a warrior, in the Shardf-Ndma, then as a philosopher, and finally as a prophet in the Iqbdl-Ndma. For this reason Nizami attaches no importance to Iskandar's origin. In the later sections especially, the poet's indebtedness to Greek wisdom can frequently be detected, though anachronisms are numerous. However, the sublimity of his thoughts could allow him at times to dispense with historical accuracy.

All his life he was preoccupied with the problems of social order and the struggle against its disturbers and enemies—indeed from this point of view, his works can be seen as a gradual crescendo culminating in the Iskandar-Nama. His last epic can be called a product of his old age only in the sense that here his humanism found its profoundest expression. The sumptuous style of his earlier poems would here have been out of place; the Iskandar-Nama is less colourfully written than the others, its allegories and symbolism standing out all the more for this reason. While Khusrau u Shirin is rich in imagery, all the later epics become increasingly simple in form, reaching their artistic culmination in the Haft Paikar.
Nizamfs great virtues are his wealth of ideas, his powerful imagina tion and infinite religious depth, command of le mot juste y perfect poetic technique, ability to choose and order his material, philosophic pro fundity, and understanding of social questions; indeed he often voices the attitude of the towns. He did much to further the introduction of vernacular current language into epic poetry, giving it the same vocabu lary which had already penetrated court poetry; in doing so, he dealt a decisive blow to the ancient epic tradition, since the latter, through its reluctance to accept the influence of Arabic, was becoming increasingly difficult to understand; indeed, Gurgani in his romantic epic Vis u Rdmin (1040-54) had not been entirely able to avoid the influence of Arabic. The heroic epic was becoming less and less important, not only because of social changes and a diminishing interest in its old style, but because it had proved incapable of casting off the studied purity of language which was its characteristic. Moreover the influence of the language of lyric poetry tended to emphasize certain aspects of epic poetry that had hitherto been overlooked, namely, the lyrical approach and psychological motivation. As the ideals of chivalry died out, the personal element came to the fore and the tragedy of the individual acquired increasing scope, all of which coincided with the rise of an urban middle class which eclipsed the other social strata. In the metrical field, on the other hand, Nizámi was in no way an innovator, since all the metres he uses can be found in earlier epics. Safa is undoubtedly right when he claims that in the disputes between Khusrau and Shirin, Nizámi imitated the corresponding passages in Gurgánfs Vis u Ramin;1 he may elsewhere have borrowed from other mathnavi writers also. But even if he did, he impressed the unique stamp of his genius on all his borrowings.

His lyrical divân is said to have amounted to almost 20.000 couplets, but apart from a number of ghazals and a handful of qasidas, is entirely lost. It would appear that tradition has greatly exaggerated the original number of lines, though what little remains is enough to show that Nizami was a great master of the ghazal. His lyric poetry is permeated with passionate emotion, and its unusual dichotomy between the poet and the person addressed generates a sense of perpetual tension. He must certainly have been writing lyric poetry throughout his life. The number of imitators of Nizami's Khamsa was exceptionally great both in Iran and in areas within the sphere of Persian culture, i.e. Turkey, Central Asia, and India.1 These writers mirrored its form and its subject-matter, and chose analagous and sometimes identical themes, often reproducing them in similar groups of five. The first and foremost imitator was Amir Khusrau (see below, pp. 606-9), who in turn influenced others after him. From the point of view of poetic quality, the magnificent epic Lailîu Majnün (895/1489-90) by Maktabi of Shirâz comes closest to Nizâmi's own poem, though Maktabi achieves new effects by the inclusion of ghazals, a practice for which there is evidence already at the beginning of the eleventh century. Maktabi's poem was in due course to have a counterpart in Fudüli's treatment of the same subject in the language of Âzarbâijân, in whose literature Fudüli's poem occupies a high place. The intense admiration which was felt for Nizamî is also reflected in arts such as miniature-painting, many of whose subjects are taken from the Khamsa.
THE ISFAHAN SCHOOL
The poet Jamal al-Din Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Razzaq Isfahani is less well known than Nizarni, but he merits attention because of his plebeian origins and especially because he represents the Isfahan School in the literature of Persian 'Iraq. Born in Isfahan of a local family who appear to have been artisans, he worked as a goldsmith and miniature-painter. His education and knowledge were of the usual kind. From early youth he began writing poetry, and although he produced much panegyric verse, he was not attached to any court. He suffered from an impediment of speech, and was left by smallpox with faulty eyesight. He attempted

to establish himself both in Àzarbàïjàn (visiting Ganja, where he must certainly have met Nizami) and in Màzandaràn, no doubt in the hope of obtaining a better livelihood from the local rulers; but he appears to have met with no success since he eventually returned to his home town, where he spent the rest of his life. He was well aware of Isfahan's short comings and censured them, but he was too patriotic to restrain his indignation when Mujir ridiculed the city. He practised all the less ambitious forms of lyric verse, though chiefly the qasida and ghazal. His qasidas sing the praises of numerous distant and nearby princely personages—especially the Isfahan! families Sa'id and Khujand (the former of the Shàfi'ite and the latter of the Hanafite persuasion)—as well as of members of learned circles. He was influenced by the great panegyric poets who were his contemporaries: Khaqani, Anvari, and Rashïd Vatvàt, actually quoting from them on occasion (though they never quote him); but in contrast to their displays of erudition, he never abandons his simplicity. He had dealings of a friendly or polemical nature with many writers. In his own writings he delighted in proffering advice to all and sundry, in admonishing and criticizing, and in imitating Sana'i, though unsuccessfully. His qasidas dispense with the exordium and plunge at once in medias res with the eulogy itself; descriptions of nature are infrequent throughout. He occupies an important position in the development of the ghazal, which he did much to perfect; its possibilities must have been particularly congenial to him, since he comes near to striking the tender notes of the ghazal in his qasidas also. Vahid praises Jamal's choice of metaphors.1 The subjects of his poems attracted attention, as is shown by the echoes found in later masters of the ghazal, including Sa'di. The ideas expressed in his works are idiosyncratic: he is constantly longing for renunciation but never practises it. His reflexions are based on traditional and formal theology rather than on philosophy or mysticism.2 " The qasida known as dshüb-i rü^gàr [confusion of the times] sums up all the bitterness of human life."3 He died in 588/1192.
His son Kamàl al-Din Isma'il of Isfahan (b. 568/1172-73) was one of the great poets of Isfahan and one of the very last important panegyric poets. Although he was prevented from completing his education by the financial difficulties which beset his family after his father's death, the technical expressions recurrent in his writings show that he was

soundly versed in all the customary branches of knowledge. Besides Persian he wrote Arabic poetry; but this has perished along with his prose writings. Like his father he was a Sunnite of the Shafi'ite persua sion, though he was also a member of the Sufi order. But asceticism was by no means the keynote of his life; he was an excellent backgammon player and a lover of wine, which he used to request from those whose praises he sang. He began to write verses when a boy, and at the age of twenty composed the famous elegy on the death of his father, a work of high perfection. The influence of a member of the Sa'id family secured him a public position, but he lost it as a result of envious calumny and even suffered a fine. Although he was pardoned, he gave up the idea of an official career and thenceforth devoted himself solely to poetry. The influential persons to whom he addressed his eulogies ensured him a quiet life, and a considerable income too, which enabled him to support others less fortunate than himself. Besides praising the two distinguished Isfahan! families (Sacid and Khujand), he wrote eulogies of the Khwarazm-Shahs, the atabegs of Fars and the princes of Tabaristan, His love for his home town was even greater than his father's. For all his Sufism, he was fond of luxury, ostentation, and the society of the great; and he lacked neither presumption nor desire for fame. O n the other hand, he never harmed others. A t the approach of the Mongol invaders he fled into the outskirts of the city disguised as a dervish, but this did not save him; he died in 635/1237 at the hands of the Mongols, when it was dis covered quite by chance that he had hidden people's valuables in a well. His tomb has been preserved. Kamal was most at home in panegyric poetry. In contrast to his father's, his verse contains less depth of feeling, though it is more polished and exceptionally rich in new and striking ideas. Because of this he was called Khalldq al-macdm" Creator of subtle thoughts " . The lack oflyrical exordia in his qasidas is compensated by the frequent interjection of didactic advice, mystical reflexions, laments on life, sickness, transitoriness, and the all-pervading decay of civilization. His descriptions have always attracted unanimous praise. Kamal was the creator of the standard "Iraqi type of qasida, which was later—like his father's ghazal—brought to its fullest perfection by Sa'di. He also practised the shorter forms of lyric poetry, but did not reach very great heights in the ghazal because he often chose inappropriate modes of expression. Ritter has recorded the existence of a mathnavi by Kamal on the subject of mystic love.1

THE GREAT MYSTICS
THE GREAT MYSTICS
There is probably no author in the whole of Persian literature whose biography and works present so many riddles as do those of 'Attar. Virtually nothing is known about him because the works themselves, in so far as they are reliable and authentic, betray virtually nothing. The story that Abu. Hamid Muhammad b. Abu. Bakr Ibrahim, generally known as Farid al-Din 'Attar, lived the same number of years as there are suras in the Qur'an (114) must be firmly rejected. Since the date of his death can be ascertained with relative accuracy, the date of his birth can best be placed in 5 37/1142-43 or three years later. He was born in Nishapur or in a neighbouring suburb or town. In his poems he calls himself 'Attar, which means both "apothecary", which in fact he was, and also " doctor ". In the pharmacy in Nishapur, which he had inherited from his father, about five hundred people had their pulses taken daily; yet in spite of this he was soon able to complete the epics Musibat-Ndma and Ildhi-Ndma, which he had begun in his shop. There were advantages as well as drawbacks to his noisy surroundings, as he met people from all walks of life and was able to learn much from them. Amongst them were adherents to Sufism, who introduced him to the miraculous world of the saints, and he certainly had links with Sufi circles. It is nowadays considered possible that he came into contact in 616-17/1219-21 with Maulavi, who was at that time a boy, for it was to Maulavi, when on his wanderings, that the aged 'Attar dedicated his epic Asrdr-Ndwa, while to Maulavi's father he prophesied that Maulavi would scorch with fire those whom the world had scorched. 'Attar himself writes that he visited the doctor Majd al-Din Khwarazmi (drowned in 606/1209-10 or in 616/1219-20), who was a follower of Shaikh Najm al-Din Kubra (d. 618/1221); but he himself was never Najm al-Din's disciple. A venerable old man, he was killed during a massacre in 618/1221, when, according to 'Ata Malik Juvaini, his native town was taken by the Mongols. Thus he reached the age of eighty-one. His grave can still be seen in Shadyakh, a suburb of Nishapur, not far from the mausoleum of the saint Muhammad Mahruq and the tomb of 'Umar Khayyam. 'Attar regarded himself as a prolific writer, but it is extremely difficult to ascertain exactly what he wrote. Once again we are confronted with numbers that cannot be trusted: a total of sixty-six works is reached if genuine, dubious, and spurious works are all included. But even if we confine ourselves to extant and definitely genuine mathnavis (Khusrau

Nâma, Asrâr-Nâma, Mantiq al~tair, Muşîbat-Nâma, Ilâhi-Nâmd), to gether with a divan of lyric poetry, a collection of quatrains entitled Mukhtdr-Ndma, and the insignificant Pand-Ndma, we are still faced with an impressive total of approximately 45,000 lines. 'Attar's best-known epic, and crowning achievement in the art of the mathnavi, is the Mantiq al-tair, " T h e Language of the Birds" (an expression taken from the Qur'àn, S. XXVII, 16), which is often called Maqâmât-i Tuyur, or " T h e Stations of the Birds". He was not the first to pick such a theme: Abü 'Ali Sina had already written the symbolical Risdlat al-tair, "Treatise on Birds", in Arabic, and a poem of the same title, also in Arabic, is ascribed to Muhammad Ghazàli (d. 505/ m i ) . 'Attar's immediate sources or models were Ghazàlï's work, the allegorical dialogues about birds in the famous Ismà'ïlí-slanted encyclo paedia of the tenth-century Ikhwdn al-Şafâ ("Brothers of Purity"), and Sanâ'i's Sair al-ibdd (see above, p. 557). 'Attar blended his models, changed the object of the quest from the mythological bird 'Anqa and the mythological bird Simurgh, and made brilliant use of the double meaning of the name Simurgh. In his version all kinds of birds assemble and decide to go and search for a king to rule over them. Hudhud, the hoopoe, assumes the leadership of the expedition because he knows where the Simurgh, the rightful king of the birds, lives; but he cannot set out alone. The birds are deterred by the difficulties ahead of them, and talk each other into pursuing aims which, though not despicable, are earthly and of little value for their quest; but the hoopoe always dissuades them from these aims. The journey is long and arduous, since the pilgrims have to pass through seven perilous valleys. Many of the birds fall by the wayside, but the survivors journey on for many years; the majority perish, until only thirty birds remain {si murgh). Finally they reach the court of the Simurgh. There the sun of his presence shines, and in their own reflexions they recognize themselves, the thirty birds, si murgh, the Simurgh. When they gaze on the Simurgh they behold themselves, and when they gaze on themselves they behold the Simurgh: and if they look on both at once, they see only one Simurgh. After many ages have passed, the birds are restored to their own identity and enter the state of " continuing to exist after having ceased to b e " .
The Ilâhi-Nâma or " B o o k of G o d " also takes the form of a story within a story, its principal theme being %uhd, i.e. renunciation of worldly desires and wishes, whose place should be taken by the higher

ideals of mystic ethics and piety. The king asks his six sons what it is that they most desire. The first asks for the daughter of the king of the Peris, the second for knowledge of the magic arts, the third for Jamshid's magic goblet, the fourth for the elixir of life, the fifth for Solomon's magic ring, and the sixth for the philosophers' stone. The king convinces each in turn of the thoughtlessness of his wishes and guides them towards higher goals. While dialogue and persuasive speeches are the structural basis of the Ildhi-Ndma, dialogue plays a noticeably less important role in the epic Mustbat-Ndma.1 The subject of the story within the narrative framework is the soul's journey during the meditation of mystical seclusion. It is possible that the accounts of spiritual journeys by the famous mystic Bayazid Bistami (d. 261/874), which 'Attar himself recorded in the Tadhkirat al-Auliydy specifically suggested this poem to him, or at least influenced his writing of it. In the Musibat-Ndma the thought of the soul in meditation wanders through the mythical and physical cosmos, personified as a traveller who is the disciple of a pir (master of a mystic order). The traveller passes through forty stations corresponding to the forty days of his meditative seclusion, and after each of his visionary dialogues with one of the mythical, cosmic, and physical beings, or personified virtues of the soul, he receives instruction from the pir concerning his interlocutor; thus here too the sequence of speech, reply, and concluding lesson is preserved. The attitude of the traveller is one of spiritual distress, perplexity, irresolution, and despair. From the beings he visits he is seeking help, guidance, and deliverance from his tormenting condition. Each time he begins his speech with a captatio benevolentiae, by enumerating the being's claims to fame, but all his requests receive negative answers, which always derive from the diffi culties of each being's own position. The prophets direct him to Muham mad, who at last shows him the right way, the way into his own soul.
Quite different in structure is the relatively less extensive AsrdrNdma, constructed in the manner of Sana'i's Hadiqa, the later Mathnavi of Maulavi. In this small work many of the themes whose variations dominate the great epics are briefly sounded, the passages of theoretical instruction and the exhortations taking up more space than in the other works. The Khusrau-Ndma or Khusrau u Gul is the complete antithesis of all four works so far mentioned. Logical and compact in structure,2

it is a romantic story about two lovers, a piece of fiction of the usual adventure type without any trace of mysticism; it was probably an early work composed shortly after the death of the poet's mother. The real heroine of the epic is a most enchanting woman whose great beauty involves her in sufferings of all kinds, but who at the end victoriously maintains her feminine purity.1 It must be emphasized that all 'Attar's epics except for the last-named contain a much greater amount of abstract thought than their basic plots would suggest, since these are mainly taken up with the individual stories illustrating the underlying theme. 'Attar's divan contains about 10,000 lines of lyric poetry in the form of qasidas and ghazals. It is almost devoid of descriptions of nature, and is completely lacking in panegyric verse (which 'Attar eschewed com pletely, being quite indifferent to all holders of power); but his poetry is marked by transports of ecstatic fervour (and often rindl)? In this he exerted a certain influence on Sa'di and Háfiz. He constantly uses word-repetition and regular refrains, no doubt to bring about a heightening of emotion. In comparison with Sana'i's ghazals, those of 'Attar are distinguished by a great emphasis on mystical symbolism and by infectious enthusiasm. The Mukhtár-Náma, " B o o k of Selections", forms an independent collection of 2,010 quatrains which 'Attár himself selected as the best in his entire works and arranged in fifty chapters according to their content. Exceptionally important is the Tadhkirat al-auliya, which consists of ninety-seven biographies of early mystics and is an excellent example of old, straightforward Persian prose. Twenty-three of the items, however, must be ascribed to Ahmad al-Tusi (twelfth century) and four to a later author. 'Attár deepens the pantheistic tasavvuf by making the quest for the absolute more thorough—a quest whose central idea is the deification of the self. T o set free the divine substance in himself completely and become God, a human being must take the way offund, or cessation of being. The only force which can make this possible is that love which is prepared to make the utmost sacrifices.3 Passionate tones accompany this mystical speculation. Jalál al-Dln Rumi expresses his admiration for

Sanâ'I, but regards himself as nothing better than a slave in comparison to 'Attar. As in other cases, modern research has shown how the biography of Maulânâ Jalâl al-Din Rûmi (whom the Persians generally call Maulavi) has in the course of time been distorted and endowed with legendary features, though it must be admitted that the romantic vicissitudes of his life provided good grounds for this. Born in 604/1207, he came of an old and learned family in Balkh, where his father, Bahâ' al-Din Muhammad Valad, was a well-known preacher by no means averse to mystical speculation. He compiled a collection of memorable fragments from his sermons under the title Ma'arif, " G n o s e s " , echoes of which can be heard even in Maulavi's divân and mathnavi. Fear of the Mongols, together with the pressures of various controversies, im pelled Bahâ' al-Din to leave Balkh in about 616/1219-20, first for the holy places and then via Damascus to Qonya (c. 618/1221-22). After Bahâ's death (628/1230-31) Maulavi came under the influence of the mystic Burhan al-Din Muhaqqiq of Tirmidh, a disciple of his father.1 Following no doubt the suggestion of this spiritual guide, he set out for Aleppo and Damascus to further his education. It may have been in Damascus that he first met the wandering dervish Shams al-Din Muhammad Tabriz!, for whom he conceived a passionate attachment after the death of Burhan al-Din in 638/1240-41. When Shams al-Din appeared in Qonya in 642/1244, he was at that time allegedly sixty years old. Nevertheless his physical beauty and his novel mystical-narcissistic theories concerning the higher world of the beloved (ma'shuq) com pletely captivated Maulavi. When this passionate affair had aroused the antipathy ofhis disciples, Shams departed for Damascus in high dudgeon, but he allowed his pupil's fervent supplications to weaken his resolve, and finally consented to return to Qonya, only to arouse another immediate outbreak of hostility (645 /1247), which once again compelled him to leave the place. After this he vanished into thin air, but not with out leaving some traces, because his sayings were later collected under the title Maqalat-i Shams-i Tabri^ Although these are difficult to under stand, the ideas they have in common with Maulavi's writings indicate the influence of Shams al-Din on the latter. In vain the pupil searched for his master. It is thought that the dance
1 Gölpınarlı in his article "Mawlana" comes to the conclusion that Maulavi at the time of his meeting with Shams al-Din was already 62 years old. He bases his argument on a ghaçal of the poet. This hypothesis strikes me as very doubtful.

which members of the Maulavi order still perform to the languid sound of a reed flute and the gentle beating of a miniature double-drum repre sents the vain and desperate search for this mysteriously lost friend. This whirling dance is the centre-piece of all the rites of the Maulavi dervishes and was instituted by Maulavi himself. His longing and his anxiety made him a truly great poet; he identified himself with the vanished macshuq, and in so doing found him again spiritually. His poems are not sung by himself, they are sung by his teacher reimbodied in him. He even wrote under the name of Shams-i Tabri^ " S u n of Tabriz", though occasionally he uses the name Khdmush, i.e. "Silent O n e " , which Golpinarli thinks he had adopted as a pseudonym before his meeting with Shams al-Din. The playing of music and the singing of passionate hymns and dances were well able to rouse his turbulent emotions; they were roused too by his new mystical and emotional attachment to an illiterate "goldsmith", Salah al-Din Faridun Zarkub, with whom he became so infatuated that the jealousy and animosity of his other disciples were once again aroused, leading to a grave crisis in the order. After Salah's death (662/1263-64) the master turned his affections to Husam al-Din Hasan, who was the actual inspiration of his principal work. Jalal al-Din's mortal pilgrimage came to an end on Sunday, 5 Jumada II, 672/7 December 1273; his bier was accompanied to the grave by the entire population of Qonya, not only the Muslims but the Christians and Jews also, all of whom remembered the master's boundless tolerance.
The lyrical Kulliyjdt-i Shams, " The Complete [lesser] Poems of Shams", amount to a total of 36,349 lines in the excellent critical edition by Professor BadT al-Zaman Furuzanfar. From first to last these poems are permeated with the mystical idea of the identification of subject with object, which leads on the one hand to pantheism and on the other to self-deification, " i n which the narcissistic theme of the identification of the self with the loved object, of its fusion with it, is very prominent". In the impassioned ecstasy with which ideas and visions well up in them, these lyrics far exceed all Persian poetry previously written; indeed they were dictated in what amounts to a trance and, by contrast with the works of other poets, are in fact relatively simple in style. Despite this, the grandiose scale of the under lying ideas has a tiring effect because it is expressed with a monotonous seriousness to which all the lyrical variations, however, colourful and fiery, are unable to impart sufficient variety and interest.

must be emphasized, has never been one of the virtues of Persian poetry; on the other hand, the remarkable subtlety with which spiritual processes are described—in Maulavi's work too—must be counted to its credit. Jalal al-Din's principal work, an encyclopaedia or rather bible of Sufism and theosophy, is the Mathnavi-i Ma'navi, " The Mathnavi con cerned with the Inner Meaning of all T h i n g s " . 1 It is in six books, amounting to a total of 27,000 lines, the sixth book being unfinished and the seventh spurious. It is less passionate than the ghazals, but possesses great poetical beauty and other artistic qualities, quite apart from its importance for Sufi philosophy and ethics. The poem lacks the customary opening cantos and begins with the lament of the reed flute, which was suggested by (Pseudo ?-)'Attar.2 The sustained feat of imagination is astonishing when one considers that the work was dictated, to the one who inspired it, over a period of more than ten years which included several intervals; but this is partially offset by a certain lack of harmony in its contents (in this respect Maulavi re sembles Sana'i) and by some slight formal aberrations. Reflexions alternate with parables and stories of the most varied kinds, the one often interrupting the other; emotions alternate with thoughts, erudition and rhetoric with simplicity, yet the language is so flexible that it always suits the content exactly. There can be no doubt that the technique of the narrative episodes in his Mathnavi is carried to even greater perfection than in the works of cAttar. A difficulty of a special kind lies in "the sequence of ideas, which is loosely associative and reminiscent almost of a train of thought. Another peculiarity is the relation of each story to the teachings attached to it. Often the story is not an allegory or moralizing parable; its purpose is simply to arouse the listener's interest in what is to follow, the latter being only loosely connected. One would expect the moral to be based on the actual point of the story. This is, however, by no means always the case. " 3 Here too the influence of'Attar can be detected. Thanks to Nicholson's critical edition, which provides both a translation and a commentary by the same scholar, it has at last become possible to penetrate into
1 It should not pass unnoticed that, according to Golpinarli the Maulavi dervishes did not regard themselves as Sufis and stood aloof from the Sufi orders. Cf.

Maulavf s theological system and to trace its connexions with Sana'! and particularly with 'Attar. Ritter fears that the results of such an inquiry, though likely to be considerable, might be less rewarding than could be expected, and he therefore suggests that Maulavf s philosophy should be studied above all with the help of other authentic sources. These, says Ritter, are his letters and sermons, the sayings contained in his Fih։ ma f։hi9 i.e. " Miscellanies the works of his father, the sur viving tradition of his teacher Shams-i Tabriz!, the memoirs of Ahmad Aflakl (d. 761/1360), and lastly the works of Maulavf s son Sultan Valad (d. 712/1312), who was also a Sufi poet and with whom the history of the Maulavi order really begins. The establishment and growth of the order and the initiation of its first rituals were all the work of Valad. He also applied the concept of theophany to saints and shaikhs and made three hitherto unknown favourites of his father famous. He wrote a mathnavi in three parts, which provides authentic information about his father and his doctrines; the second part, usually known as the Rabdb- Ndma, " B o o k of the Rebec", consists of two sections which are very important philologically, for one is in Saljuq Turkish and the other in Greek.

We think of the most popular moralist in Persian literature, indeed one of the most famous of all Persian poets, not as a stern mentor but as a jovial, laughing person, with perhaps a glimmer of good-humoured roguishness. That is at any rate the kind of person who emerges from his works. The biographical facts that have been handed down con tribute little towards his portrait. And even Sa'df s own words cannot altogether be trusted; they cannot be taken literally and this makes it extremely hazardous to base a reconstruction of his life on the many stories which he tells, presumably only to entertain and instruct.1 There is no contemporary information about him; uncertainties abound at every point. A s to the dating of his life prior to 655/1257 and after 680/1281-82, there is nothing definite to g o on and we must be content with hypotheses.2 The oldest records give us these names: Muslih al-Din Abu Muhammad 'Abdallah b.

as Sa'di Şhırâzı,1 but there are numerous variants. Both his own works and tradition confirm that he was born in Shiraz, a town to which he remained most movingly loyal throughout his life and for which, no doubt, he longed passionately when travelling abroad. The date of his birth is based entirely on hypothesis, the most plausible suggestion being that of 'Abbas Iqbal: 610-15/1213-19. Even then Sa'di would have reached a great age, though not the legendary one of 120. Thanks largely to the considerable culture of his father, Sa'di received a careful education from an early age; he often recalls his father's love and wise guidance. His mother continued the same routine after his father died, when Sa'di was only about twelve. Shirâz was by no means short of schools, and Sa'di began his studies there; these were cut short by his move to Baghdad, made through fear of the " Turks " (or so at least he says in the Gülistan). Tradition maintains that he was sent to Baghdad where he was supported by the Salghurid atabeg of Şhîrâz; but he certainly cannot have gone there as early as 592/1196, since it is said that he studied at the famous Shâfi'ite university, the Nizâmiyya. More over it is scarcely credible that the atabeg would have accorded such a favour to a boy of humble albeit educated background. Attempts have been made to derive specific dates from the names, which he himself gives, of his teachers in Baghdad: yet here, too, difficulties arise. Nor can anything be learnt from the passages in which Sa'di apparently addresses himself as a man aged fifty or sixty. We only know that after completing his studies he set off on travels which took him to Iraq, Syria, and the Hijâz. On the other hand it is hard to believe that he travelled in eastern Iran, Transoxiana, and India. The many impossible ingredients in the story of how he destroyed the infamous idol in the temple of Somnat exclude the likelihood that he visited India. Equally untenable is the description of his meeting with a boy in Kâshghar, which, if true, would suggest that even before the completion of the Gülistan his fame as a poet had spread to such remote areas; this is quite unlikely even if the date of the peace treaty between the KhwarazmShâh and the Qara-Khitai (probably 1210) is arbitrarily moved forward. This objection is corroborated by the fact that the best Persian Ars Poetica, al-Mucjam (630/1232-3) by Shams-i-Qais, contains no quota tions from Sa'di, though there are a great many from other poets of that period. The Gülistan mentions a visit to Tabriz, where Sa'di is said to have

met the Sahib-Divan Shams al-Din Muhammad Juvaini, his brother 'Ala' al-Din 'Ata-Malik Juvaini (see below, pp. 622-3), and the IIKhan Abaqa himself, to all of whom he gave advice at their requestadvice, however, which is much too naive for the episode to be credible. That Sa'di was famous at that time can be accepted without difficulty (Abaqa ruled from 663 to 680/1265-82), but it is very doubt ful that he would have set out alone from Shiraz to Tabriz since he declined other journeys at that time, though he did sing the praises of Sahib-Divan Juvaini. Other meetings with famous people provide the material for favourite anecdotes, not a word of which can be true. For example, in Shiraz he is supposed to have met Shaikh Safi al-Din, the earliest ancestor of the Safavid dynasty, whom he represents as holding strong Shi'i beliefs; the fact that both men were Sunnis was readily overlooked for the purposes of the anecdote. Sa'di's return to Shiraz after many years of travel brings us to the first reliable dates. Soon afterwards he completed his didactic epicBustdn, " T h e Orchard" (655/1257), and a year later he finished his Gulistdn, "Rose-Garden", which is written in both prose and verse, the former poem being dedicated to the ruling atabeg Muzaffar al-Din Abu. Bakr b. Sa'd Zangi, the latter to his son Sa'd b. Abu. Bakr b. Sa'd Zangi, from whom Sa'di took his nom de plume. Its derivation from the name of a prince has no significance, for there are other instances, the best-known being Qa'ani in the nineteenth century. Sa'di had certainly begun writing before this time, but he had not yet acquired fame. He left Shiraz unknown, and returned there equally unknown. Fame—and it was quite phenomenal—came only with the Bustdn and then especially with the Gulistdn, two works from which he has been universally quoted ever since.
Sa'di's -assertion that he composed the Bustdn immediately after his return to Shiraz and the Gulistdn only a year later must be understood in the sense that he completed sketches brought back from his travels, because such short periods of composition would scarcely be possible for works so replete with details and original perceptions, not to mention their formal elegance and indeed perfection. Sa'di settled permanently in his beloved Shiraz, where in monk-like seclusion he devoted himself to meditation and poetry; from the abundant experi ence which he had gained in his own life he imparted advice to rulers and subjects, disciples and admirers, and in turn delighted in their benevolence, their gifts and the subsistence they provided. This period

probably saw the composition of most of his lyric poetry, comprising both the ghazals and didactic panegyrical qasidas, in which he admonishes the great and comments on current events.1 It is curious that he nowhere alludes to the death of the two brothers Juvaini; did he fear to do so, or had he already ceased writing ? Nafisi has estab lished the correct date of Sa'dTs death, from among a great many put forward, as 27 Dhu'l-Hijja 691/9 December 1292.2 It cannot be disputed that Sa'di was an adherent of Sufism. The ambiguity of his ghazals may be overlooked, because this was custom ary. The most convincing proof of his Sufi outlook is the chapter on love in the Bustdn. His tendency, however, was not towards speculation but at most towards asceticism, and his motives were dictated more by utilitarianism than by philosophical ethics. This is why, as a moralist, he shows little regard for consistent adherence to ethical doctrines which he himself has propounded elsewhere, but prefers to counten ance exceptions which are quite their reverse when he feels there is no alternative. Truth is holy, certainly, but there can be occasions when prudence ordains a lie. This Sa'di illustrates in the very first anecdote in the first chapter of the Gulistdn^ where infringement of the principle of truth is dictated by common humanity, since otherwise the caprice or stupidity of the king and the ruthlessness of his advisers would un doubtedly have led to bloodshed. A whole series of similar antinomies could be cited. In his own life, too, Sa'di did not always act in accord ance with strict ethical principles. If he belonged to those rare figures in Persian literature who valued freedom of literary expression, who disliked the obsequiousness of panegyric verse and preferred to express admonition in their qasidas, thus virtually committing themselves to controversies with the rulers, why then did he sing the praises of Hiilegii, the very man who had removed the Salghurid Saljuq-Shah, destroyed Baghdad, and put the last 'Abbasid Caliph al-Musta'sim to a most ignominious death ? Why again did he lament this very caliph in a heart-rending elegy—quite out of line with the policy of his lord and master in Shiraz, Abu. Bakr b. Sa'd, who, while professing to accept the Sunna, led his army in support of the Mongol campaign to destroy the centre of Sunni Islam ? Shibli supposes that Sa'di, although usually included amongst the greatest Sufis, was really no Sufi by nature, but had to make an intense effort to accept Sufism, being

naturally more inclined to externals in the manner of the mullas;1 indeed, he tells how his father castigated him when a small boy for his egotism and his critical eye for the faults of others. Sa'di also criticizes pederasty, though he is not immune to similar tendencies himself. This literary output embraces every kind of lyric poetry, as well as the didactic epic and elegant prose. The heroic epic did not suit his pacific nature (the prelude to a battle scene in the Bustdn is a display of bravura written to prove he could do it if he wished). A brilliant story-teller, he lacked the patience to allow himself to be tied to a single theme, which is necessary in romantic epics often thousands of lines in length, but not in didactic epics with their varied contents. Though he brought the ghazal to the highest degree of perfection in the period, he w o n most esteem for the prose of his world-famous Gulistdn. He was thus a master of both prose and verse. Sa'di's principal didactic works are the Bustdn and the Gulistdn. Moralizing verse had long been in existence, it is true, but the great poet of Shiraz was the first to raise it to the level of true poetry. The Bustdn, or perhaps more correctly Sa'di-Ndma, is an epic in the mutaqdrib metre (three bacchic and one iambic foot), which was erroneously regarded as a prerogative of the heroic epic. The poem is almost 4,500 lines long and, apart from the opening (Sunni) doxology, is divided into ten chapters which deal in turn with various virtues. The poet begins each chapter with the outline of a theoretical problem and then illustrates it either from his own experience or from legends, history, and so on, in the manner usual in all didactic mathnavis. These parables, which are almost always brief, occur more frequently than in other comparable works. The Gulistdn follows the same ideological pattern. Its form may not have been beneficial to the development of Persian prose, for the work was written in rhyming and rhythmic prose interspersed with verses (which take up about a third of the book) in the manner of the Mundjdt ("Prayers"), by Ansari (d. 481/1088), who seems to have been Sa'di's model. In contrast with the Bustdn, where the parables are linked to ethical problems, the anecdotes form the body of the Gulistdn, one or two lines of pithy wisdom being deduced from each: in fact this is a kind of miniature maqdma (see below, p. 618). The book consists of an introduction and eight chapters in which the anecdotal material is arranged under particular headings. Sometimes the title does not fit

the anecdote, at other times the deduction has no recognizable con nexion with it. Sa'di's style is characterized by a sovereign command of language, refined simplicity (lacking only in the somewhat overornamental introduction), and by a terseness at that time rare. If the Büstdn cannot be said to contain any deep philosophy (except perhaps in the Süfi third chapter concerning love), this is even more true in the thoroughly practical and sociologically more down-to-earth Gulistan, where the deductions are usually no more than the most obvious commonplaces, clothed admittedly in matchless poetry. A n attempted translation will, to one's surprise, produce shapeless banality, because nothing can replace the magic of Sa'di's own simplicity. He can strike a spark of poetry from the most insignificant everyday occurrence, and the occurrence does not necessarily have to contain a lesson. The tone of the work is kaleidoscopic, the serious alternating with the comic, the sublime with the frivolous. There are also certain difficult passages; a good example is Sa'di's dispute with a dervish about rich people, who are criticized for their indifference to the poor and to those in distress. A t first sight it appears that Sa'di is trying to defend the rich; but a deeper insight into his polished but bitter irony shows on whose side he was really.
Sacdi's two main works have produced a host of imitations (the Gulistdn understandably even more than the Büstdn). The best-known are Jàmf s Bahdristdn ("Spring Garden") written in 892/1487, and Qà'anï's Kitdb֊iParïsh_àn ("Pell-Mell"), written in 1152/1836. Although popular at courts, Sacdi was certainly no court poet; despite this he could not entirely resist the attraction of panegyric verse, for all his condemnation of it. In the traditional order the cata logue of his lyric poetry contains four collections of qasidas and one extensive strophic poem. But there is one great difference between him and his precursors. He came into contact with a great many courts, but he never renounced his belief in freedom of thought and freedom of the pen; nor did he ever beg. His eulogies are restrained; he rightly accuses Zahir Faryabi of exaggeration, and all the more eager to fill his own qasidas with good advice and wise remarks addressed to the shahs, in which he urges generosity and goodness, appeals to their better selves, and emphasizes the transitoriness of the world. T o do this he had to choose his mode of expression judiciously, otherwise his audacity might have brought risks; he was, however, protected by his personal authority. In these lyric poems the didactic element is most prominent,

the lyric least. N o t all the qasidas can be said to be valuable, for many are marred by diffuseness and monotony. As regards content and scope, the main part of Sa'di's output lies in the books of ghazals, together with a collection of aphorisms and maxims called Sdhibiyja, and finally his "Fragments", i.e. quatrains and single lines. The century-long development of the ghazal before Hafiz culminates in Sa'di. What is his particular merit ? Above all, he does not merely play with words in his praises of the beloved, but allows himself to be moved by feelings of genuinely experienced love, whether we regard it as realistic or transcendental. According to Bahar, many of the poems come near to declaring their political themes under the guise of wine and the beloved. Certainly Sa'di the moralist is true to himself when he opposes hypocrisy in all its forms. He also creates many subjects which are new and gives new colours to old ones. Not the least of his characteristics are the simplicity of the language, the appropriateness of his metres, the lightness of his refrains, and the direct way in which each story makes its single point. Critical studies of Sa'di's literary remains have recently been under taken by Furughi and Aliyev. Six treatises written in ornate prose (that is, prose alternating with verse, as in the Gulistdn) have survived under Sa'di's name, though at least one of them cannot be deemed authentic. T o these can be added a seventh, which is a shallow parody of the mystical and religious homily in the second treatise, and is also probably spurious. Sa'di himself, however, is undoubtedly the author of some short tales in the fifth chapter of the Gulistdn which are far removed from the fragrance of the rose-garden. Indeed their existence helps to prove the authenticity of the extremely scabrous (Mutdyabdt " Jokes " , also known as Khabithdt or Ha^liyjdt, " Facetiae " ) , a collection of somewhat monotonous poems quite lacking in artistic taste, which Sa'di claims, in an apology in his preface, that he was ordered to write. In this aspect of the work of Sa'di, and of all similar writers, Bausani sees the only example of realism in traditional Persian literature: an extremely barren one at that. The authorship of the Pand-Ndma " Book of Maxims" is disputed; it was at one time a favourite text for study in the West, and contains many sound principles without ever aspiring to great artistic heights. Sa'di is one of the most lively and colourful figures in Persian and indeed world literature. Yet it is quite impossible to co-ordinate his ideas into an integral system.

to be without inconsistencies, he is nevertheless always convincing, and his great attraction possibly lies in the very contrariety of his paradoxical ideas. These are for the most part truisms, but they are so superbly expressed that they are comprehensible even to the simplest person. Many have become proverbs, if they were not proverbs originally. Echoes of Firdausi, Asadí, Saná'í, Anvarí, Zahir Fáryabl, and even the Arabic poet Mutanabbi (d. 354/965) show Sa'dfs wide reading and good taste, while an inimitable lightness of touch pervades all his work. One of his most sublime ideals was the brotherhood of man, and his Süfism served the common people by encouraging activity and a balanced life; and in like manner he attacked intolerance, in justice, exploitation, and hypocritical or extravagant piety. But Sa'di's unique and lasting success lies above all in his universally accessible and accommodating moral philosophy. The Persian, as indeed any human being, can see himself in Sa'dL
SA'DI'S CONTEMPORARIES
(a) Panegyric writers
The Mongol invasion wrought such havoc in Khurasan, Ázarbáíján, and finally in central Iran, that poetry took a long time to recover in those areas. The great poets of the seventh/thirteenth century lived in unscathed peripheral lands, i.e. the south-west (Sa'di), Asia Minor (Maulavi), and India (Amir Khusrau). In Iran proper, literary life was concentrated at Shiraz, which had been left more or less untouched by the Mongols. The central figure here was undoubtedly Sa'di; the rest were merely imitators of earlier writers or of Sa'di himself. One writer deserving mention is Radi al-Dín Abü 'Abdallah Muhammad b. Abü Bakr Imami of Herat (d. 676/1277-79), who wrote panegyrics of the amirs and viziers of Kirmán. His qasidas and ghazals are simple in style and reflect the spirit of tasavvuf. Imami's work has received obviously exaggerated praise from his better-known contemporary Majd al-Din Hamgar (b. 607/1210-11, d. 686/1287), who was at first a functionary and a panegyric writer at the court of the Salghurid atabegs of Shiráz. After their downfall, he was active at Isfahan and Baghdad, travelled through Khurasan, and finally returned to his native city. As a poet he shows a command of delicate ideas, and his quatrains, varied in theme and expression and personal rather than speculative in tone, are extremely beautiful.

Q?) Mystics
Fakhr al-Din Ibrahim b. Shahryar 'Iraqi was a contemporary of Sa'di and, like him, had been a pilgrim in the eastern half of Islam; but in contrast to Sa'di, he was a profound theosophist. A serene thirst for knowledge and a capacity for love were the dominant traits in his character, and they shaped his whole life. Born at Hamadan in 610/ 1213, he astonished those around him by his unusual talent and erudi tion. A t the age of seventeen, he joined a band of wandering dervishes, amongst whom was a beautiful youth for whom he conceived a passionate admiration (an occurrence which was to repeat itself later). He abandoned everything, and wandered with them about Persia and India, where for twenty-five years he lived with Baha' al-Din Zakariyya of Multan, a disciple of Shihab al-Din Suhravardi. But at last the jealousy of his colleagues in the order forced him to leave secretly for Mecca. After completing the pilgrimage he visited Qonya, where he was enthralled by the lectures of Shaikh Sadr al-Din Qonavi on the speculations of the famous mystic philosopher Muhyi al-Din ibn 'Arab! (d. 638/1240). Under the impact of these lectures Iraqi wrote his Lama'dt ("Lightning Flashes"), which are ecstatic meditations on Ibn 'Arabi's Fusils al-Hikam ("Ring-Stones of Wisdom"). Circumstances led him to travel to Cairo and thence to Damascus, a place sanctified by the presence of Ibn 'Arabi's and other tombs. In both cities he was received with unprecedented pomp. He ended his days in Damascus in 688/1289 and was buried next to the grave of the man who in his eyes represented the most sublime theosophy.
The iMmcfdt, 'Iraqi's principal work, is not large in size but is pro found and truly poetic. It is written in prose interspersed with Persian and Arabic verse. With this work a new influence began to affect the theory of love, namely that of Ibn 'Arabi's theosophy, whose mono tonous outpourings were soon to inundate the last remaining islands of independent mystic thought within Islam.1 O f the various com mentaries on the book, that of Jami, entitled Ashi"a-yi ~Lamcfdt ("Flashes of Lightning", 886/1481), became the most famous. 'Iraqi's divan and his delightful 'Ushshdq-Ndma " B o o k of Lovers", also known as Dab Fas/, " Ten Chapters "), a short mathnavi incorporating ghazals, move along the same erotic-mystic lines, reaching their peak of

ecstasy in the ghazals of the divan.1 Compared with Maulavfs poems, 'Iraqi's are more polished in form. 'Iraqi's theoretical statements on mystical love are all the more important because, thanks to an extant detailed biography of him, much is known about his personal experi ences of mystical love, which is rarely the case with Persian poets. Afdal al-Din Muhammad Kashi, generally called Baba Afdal, was born around 582/1186-87 or 592/1195-96 in Maraq near Kashan, and died after 654/1256 or 664/1265-66; according to Minovi, however, he lived considerably earlier, at the beginning of the seventh/thirteenth century; he is buried in Maraq. There is scant information about his life, and it has little importance. His thought was influenced by the Batiniyya and by Avicenna, whom he also resembles in his attempts to substitute Persian technical terms for Arabic ones. His writings are chiefly in Persian, but sometimes also in Arabic. His prose works are concerned with philosophy, theosophy, metaphysics, ethics, and logic; they are partly original, partly editions or translations of the writings of others, are distinguished by a simple, intelligible, and lucid style. Bahar regards Afdal's translation of Aristotle's Kitdb al-nafs (De Animd) as exemplary. Baba Afdal's quatrains are extremely attractive, and their occasional notes of revolt were remarked on long ago by Whinfield.2 It is no wonder that several of them have gained currency as purported works of Khayyam. Baba Afdal must also be included amongst the principal theorists of Sufism. A figure of much more questionable importance is Shaikh Mahmud Shabistarl (d. c. 720/1320-21), whose Gulshan-i Rd% ("Rose-Garden of Secrets") written in 710/1311 has received some notice in the East and undue admiration in the West. It is a relatively brief compendium of symbolic " S u f i " terminology, and was in fact a series of versified replies to versified questions by Mir Husaini Sadat (d. 718/1318). The fact that the then Aga Khan interested himself in a Bombay (1280/1863) edition of this work suggests that the author (if indeed he was Shabi starl) may have had Isma'ili leanings.3 Whoever he was, he was no outstanding poet.

his artistic expression of Sufi ideas. This is particularly true of his principal work, the mathnavi Jdm-i Jam ("The Cup of Jamshid", i.e. the mirror of the whole universe), written in 733/133 2-3 3 in the manner of Sana'i's Hadtqa, though not in blind imitation, since Auhadi adapted his work to the requirements of his own age. For us today his im portance lies not so much in his mysticism as in his social and pedagogic interests, such as social intercourse, the rebuilding of cities, the education of children, criticism of magistrates, and so on, to which he gives greater attention than do most Persian poets. His poem "is thus in some sort an amalgam of the Qdbus-ndma with the Hadlqat alhaqiqa".1 Some of Auhadi's ghazals were even incorporated in the divan of Hafiz. A poet and critic as sensitive as Muhammad Bahar has observed that a ghazal by Auhadi can be fully the equal of one by Hafiz himself.2 Auhadi seems to have owed his nom de plume to the head of his order, Shaikh Abu Hamid Auhad al-Din of Kirman (d. 697/1298), who was the author of a mathnavi entitled Misbdh al-anvdh ("Light of Souls").8 This is an allegorical pilgrimage through imagi nary cities, displaying basic ideas which are strikingly similar to those of Dante's Divine Comedy. Auhad of Kirman was suspected of heresy, which is not surprising since he was a disciple of Muhyl al-Din ibn 'Arab!: he advanced the doctrine of man deified and " belongs together with Ahmad Ghazali and 'Iraqi to that group of Sufis who revered heavenly in earthly beauty".4
NIZARI
Hakim Sa'd al-Din b. Shams al-Din b. Muhammad Nizari Kuhistani (b. 645/1247-48 at Birjand, d. there in 720/1320-21) stands out among Persian poets for his individuality. He came of an old but impoverished family of the landed aristocracy, and lost what little wealth he had inherited during the Mongol invasion, so that he was reduced to a life of hardship. He acquainted himself with Persian and Arabic literature, and 'Umar Khayyam had a particularly strong and lasting influence on him. Although some of his teachers were Sunni, he held fast to the religious beliefs of his father. Nizari was ostensibly a Shi'i of the traditional kind, but he undoubtedly had leanings towards Isma'illsm,

particularly in his interpretation of the Qur'an and of external ob servances (for instance with regard to wine-drinking), and also in his refusal to believe in the existence of Hell. From his youth on he served at the court and in the chancellery of the Kart rulers of Herat, and he had perforce to sing their praises in qasidas. As if in loyalty to the Isma'ill tradition, he longed for detailed knowledge of other lands and peoples, and of their opinions; and both in his official capacity and on his own initiative he undertook many journeys. The fruit of his two years of pilgrimage (678-79/1280-81) was the Safar-Ndma (" Travel B o o k " about 1,200 lines long), in which, far from recording trivialities, he describes the life of the cities and regions he saw, his meetings with people, and other experiences. After returning to Herat he re-entered the service of the court, but was so slandered that he lost his position. A self-defence written in verse, the Mund%ara-i Shah u Ru% (" Dispute between Night and Day") resulted in his pardon, though only for a time. He then withdrew into solitude, and poetry itself is said to have become repugnant to him; eventually he set himself up as a farmer, a way of life which he, like Ibn Yamin, valued highly.
His divan contains about fifteen sections, amongst them the long mathnavi (about 10,000 lines) called A%har u Maghar, concerning the fidelity of two lovers; it was written in 700/1300. Nizari's ghazals go beyond the traditional literary models, and in so doing mirror all the more clearly the social discontent which resulted from the Mongol oppression and exploitation. Another work that bears the stamp of originality is the Dastur-Ndma (in 576 lines), a kind of parody of the popular "books of maxims", which in its language and poetic form is extremely polished; it was written for the poet's sons, but in fact " gives to those who lead a dissipated life and are partial to a goblet of wine rules of conduct which are in direct opposition to those laid down in the Qur'an". Daulatshah says that the work was much appreciated by connoisseurs and men of the world, but he does not conceal the attitude of the clergy towards the poet—to them he was a heretic indeed.1 Nizari is little known and certainly underrated. The reasons for this lie in his convictions, his opinions, and the attitude of his poetry. Bertel's regards him as an outspoken free-thinker and blasphemous underminer of the very foundations of orthodoxy.2

INDO-PERSIAN LITERATURE
The earlier phase of Islamic contact with India goes back to the eighth century; but it was little more than a prelude. In fact Islam began to take root only with Mahmud of Ghazna (early eleventh century), whose Indian policy was continued by his successors and, later, by members of other dynasties; though all were Turkish, they brought the Persian language and customs of India with their courts, because they themselves had come under the sway of Persia's highly developed culture. The influence of the courts, and the presence of Indians at them, caused Persian to spread throughout the conquered territories, where anyone wishing to enter the civil service had to master that language. The upper classes were naturally the ones affected, and it was from their ranks that the Indo-Persian poets were drawn, in so far as these were not Iranian immigrants. A s foreigners, they showed many peculiarities in their writings—writings which Persians proper regard as un-Persian. Nevertheless there were several Indo-Persian men of letters—a surprisingly large number in all—who exerted an influence in Iran itself and in Central Asia. The greatest of them was Yamin al-Din Abu'l- Hasan Amir Khusrau Dihlavi, who was born in 651/1253 at Patyali and died at Delhi seventy-five years later. Amir Khusrau was an Indian only on his mother's side; his father, an illiterate Turk from Central Asia, was a man of some importance, who had moved to India with his tribe, the Hazara-yi La chin, during the Mongol invasions, either from Transoxiana or from Balkh. A l though he belonged to the Chishti order of Sufis and was completely devoted to its shaikh, the saint and scholar Nizam al-Din Auliya (d. 725/1324), Amir Khusrau worked as a court poet in the service of various rulers and dynasties in Delhi and Multan. This did not in the least disturb the mystical bent of his lyric poetry. The poetic works of this Tuti-yi Hindi ("The Indian Parrot") were formerly estimated to run to 400,000 lines, but this total is quite fanciful and cannot stand up to critical examination, even though Khusrau was undeniably an extremely prolific poet and also a prose writer. He collected his best lyrics in five divans which contain eulogistic qasidas and also examples of all the other lyric genres, especially the ghazal. In qasidas Amir Khusrau followed the example of Khaqani, though without the latter's incomprehensibility, while also imitating Sana'i and later his own contemporary Kamal al-Din IsfahanI; in the ghazal, however, Sa'di

was his model. Muhammad Wahid Mirza, while not wishing to under rate the poet's other works, regards the ghazals as the most important part of his output and emphasizes their simplicity, internal coherence, wealth of feeling, andjoie de vivre, their melodious sound (whence their popularity amongst Sufis), and finally their intellectual sublety, a quality which he claims is lacking in the Persian poets of Iran, apart from Jam! (d. 898/1492) and Naziri (d. 1021/1612-13).1 Amir Khusrau's work culminates in his epic poetry, which is an essential link in the development of the Persian mathnavi. It consists of historical poems and of parallels to Nizaml's Khamsas each group, like the Khamsa, being divided into five parts, as is Khusrau's lyric poetry too. The themes for the first group of epics are taken entirely from contemporary local history; thus Khusrau inaugurated a new development by rejecting the romanticism of the fairy tale and the myth in a daring attempt at historical and local realism. This branch of his epic poetry, which occupied him from 688/1289 until his death, includes \Qirdn al-scfdain (" The Conjunction of the T w o Lucky Stars "), written in 688/1289, which describes the struggle for the throne and reconciliation between Kai-Qubad, the son, with Bughra-Khan, the father; Miftdh al-futuh ("The K e y to Victories"), written in 690/1291, which describes the four victories w o n by Jalal al-Din Firuz-Shah Khalji in the single year 689/1290; and the Tughlaq-Ndma, which deals with the events during the short life of Ghiyath al-Din Tughlaq-Shah, and was composed towards the end of Khusrau's life. The first of these poems was written at the behest of Kai-Qubad himself. Though the theme was not exactly attractive, the command did enable Amir Khusrau to realize his long-held ambition of trying his hand at an epic of some length, possibly in emulation of the masterly Nizami. He succeeded in avoiding the obvious pitfall of monotony and produced a work of outstanding merit, which is recognized by critics as his finest mathnavi, but to do so he had to call upon all his powers of narrative and lyric invention, interspersing a whole series of ghazals and poetic descriptions among the sections of narrative, a feature which recurs in the other poems in this group. Each chapter has a title in the form of abydt-i si/si/a, i.e. uniformly versified titles for each canto, and this practice is repeated in several of his other epics and divans. In the Miftdh al-futuh historical accuracy is emphasized; and as in the previous work, the panegyrical origin of the poem is transparent. The Tughlaq

Ndma was likewise written at a royal behest. " The mathnavi does not offer many attractions to a student of literature. It is on the whole a plain narrative but with a few of those lively and imaginative passages that characterize Khusrau's other poetical works."1 Unique features are discernible in Nuh Sipihr ("Nine Heavens")> written in 718/1318, an epic of heterogeneous content. Epic descrip tions alternate with passages praising India and more or less directly extolling Mubarak-Shah Khalji (716-20/1316-20). " T h e poem, in fact, is replete with things of immense historical and sociological interest and may safely be claimed to be a composition unique, in style and spirit, in the whole range of mathnavi literature—a poem which would amply repay a careful study and would be appreciated much better after a thorough perusal."2 In contrast with Khusrau's other versified narratives, 'Ashiqa or 'Ishqiyya (715/1316) is built around " the central theme of the romantic love and the tragic fate of Khizr Khan and the beautiful princess Devaldi".3 This epic undoubtedly influenced Salman Savaji, who was one of the first to follow the lead of the great Indian poet. Amir Khusrau was the first poet who wrote on the model of Nizami's "Quintet", and he did so in a way that was to have a decisive effect on later imitations. The Indian poet took the same subjects as in the Khamsa, altering the various episodes, the motivation, and the language to a greater or lesser extent, and displaying an erudition which, though considerable, by no means equals Nizami's. The clearcut outlines of Nizami's poetry here give way to a certain nebulous quality, and its philosophical profundity and social preoccupation vanish. But it was precisely this undisputed lowering of levels and euphuization of style which accorded with the taste of the times. There have been occasions, though only in periods of literary decadence, when critics have given preference to Khusrau's Khamsa. The great Nizami, despite his verve and creative ebullience, spent half a lifetime on the composition of his Khamsa, whereas Amir Khusrau completed his task in just under three years (698-701/1298-1301). His Khamsa does not amount to much more than half Nizami's in length. Notwith standing all his talent and wealth of imagination, the speed of com position alone would prevent his being the equal of the master of Ganja. Vahid Dastgirdi does not attribute any very great poetic value to Khusrau's Khamsa.*

Some of Khusrau's quatrains are reminiscent of Khayyam, and there are several others in praise of apprentices, the latter reputedly drawn from a collection of amorous epigrams entitled Shahr-Ashub, " D i s turbers of the City". (Humorous poems of this kind appeared both before and after Khusrau.) The question of Khusrau's Hindi poetry remains unsolved. Though the poet must certainly have known his own vernacular (after all, his mother was of Indian origin), the authen ticity of the poems ascribed to him in this idiom is extremely doubtful. He did, however, make use of Hindi words in his Persian poetry. What is of interest is his prose, even if the titles of the numerous works traditionally ascribed to him must be reduced to no more than three. The principal one of these is his Pjd^-i Khusravi (" Khusrau's Inimitability") or Rasd'il al-Yja^ (" Treatises on Inimitability"), an extensive work dating from between the years 682/1283-84 and 719/ 1319-20, which consists of six treatises on various stylistic and rheto rical questions together with examples of letters, etc. "It introduces a healthy change by his innovations inasmuch as he attached more importance to ideas and intellectual figures of speech than to senseless alliterations, quips and puns."1 His Tcfríkh-i 'Ala'i ("History of ' A l a ' " ) , or КЬа^аЧп al-futuh ("Treasure-Chambers of Victories"), written in 711/1311-12, describes events during the years 695-711/ 1296-1312, when 'Ala' al-Din was reigning. The style is extremely bombastic and precious, though the work remains an important historical source. Khusrau's Afdal al-fawa'id ("The Most Excellent Moral Precepts") is a compendium of the sayings of Nizam al-Din Auliyá, his Sufi guide.
Information has survived of the poet's musical abilities and it is probable that he did much to bring about the fusion of Persian and Indian music in India though unfortunately there are no works on music by him. Amir Khusrau is the greatest representative of Indo-Persian classi cism. His style, which BertePs2 calls "powdered", may be seen as a prelude to the "Indian style" proper, which was to arise almost three hundred years later. Although he liked to follow precedents, there is no denying that he made considerable efforts to be independent; his epics, in so far as they are based on his own experience and observa tions, are certainly original. Emotional depth and a sense of humour are outstanding qualities of his writing.

One of Amir Khusrau's close friends was Amir Najm al-Din Hasan Sijzi, surnamed Hasan Dihlavi (b. 651/1253, d. 729/1328), a court poet, though perhaps reluctantly, since it is likely that under the influence of his spiritual mentor Nizam al-Din Auliya he regarded panegyrics as unworthy of a poet. His eight hundred or so ghazals, which are much admired both in and outside India, are distinguished by simplicity of language and poetic technique and by an emotional force even greater than in Khusrau's, though Hasan knew how to be mordant as well as delicate. Marek also refers to romantic and didactic epics and prose works by Hasan.1 Although his poetry seems at first sight simple, it is in fact written with great skill. It is not surprising that he influenced even Persian and Central Asian poets such as Kamal Khujandi (d. 803/ 1400-01) and Pamir Isfahan! (d. after 985/1578); Kamal was even called "Hasan's Plagiarist". Like Khusrau, Hasan took Sa'di as a model. Compared with those of many other poets, his ghazals have a remark able internal coherence.
PANEGYRIC POETS AT MINOR COURTS
A poet whose fame was great even in his own lifetime is Kamal al-Din Abu'l-'Ata Mahmud b. 'All, whose poetic pseudonym Khwaju. (" The Little Lord") was probably a childhood nickname. Born in 689/1290 or 679/1281 at Kirman, he was very much a court poet, as his qasidas, dedications, and epics prove. His patron was the last Il-Khan Abu. Sa'id; he then served the Muzaffarids and the Jalayirids, finally settling at the court of Abu. Ishaq Inju. in Shiraz, where he died in 753/1352 or 762/1361. Much of his life was spent wandering from place to place, and in so doing he became acquainted with many people and joined a Sufi order, which was to make its mark on his writing. He was twenty-seven when one of his qasidas was immortalized in plaster on the walls of the bath-house at Yazd. Even if later generations have somewhat modified the hasty judgments of their merit, his writings are numerous and remarkable, especially his divan entitled Sanayi* aU kamal, " A r t s of Perfection" (alluding to his name Kamal al-Din). Because he was a court poet, the panegyric element is very much to the fore, though he praised not only temporal rulers but also the imams, especially 'Ali. Much of his poetry springs from religiousmostly Sufi—and ethical considerations. His qasidas were obviously

PANEGYRIC POETS AT MINOR COURTS
written under the influence of the 'Iraqi school, while Sa'di influenced his ghazals, even though he himself maintained that he wrote in the manner of Hafiz. While it is not true that Hafiz actually praises him in so many words, the number of identical subjects in the divans of both poets suggests that they shared sympathies; a likelihood con firmed by the fact that their ghazals have been confused by later generations. Their common sphere of activity, together with the fact that they probably knew each other personally, makes it easy to believe that they influenced each other, and Khwaju is more likely to have influenced the young Hafiz than vice versa. Kopriilu sees in Khwaju's ghazals a connecting link between Sa'di and Hafiz,1 Shibli Nu'mani perceives a lack of mysticism in his poetry and in consequence regards him as nothing more than a colourful flower without a scent.2 Khwaju even wrote riddles and logogriphs, both decadent literary genres but widely popular for this very reason; on the other hand he was adept at choosing the mot juste, and was versed in intricacies of poetic tech nique and stylistic art to the point of artificiality. In writing a " Quintet" Khwaju modelled his work on Nizami's, but also introduced alterations which were to be perfected one and a half generations later by Jami. Khwaju's mathnavis belong to his maturity, perhaps even to his old age. T w o of them are love stories, the other three being devoted to religious themes, either ethical, Sufi, or inspired by the poet's membership of his order. The love stories concern the adventures of two couples, Humdi u Humayun (732/1331-32) and Gul u Nauru^ ("Rose and N e w Y e a r " , 742/1341-42), the latter being the better mathnavi, though its subject matter is not original. Both are almost like fairy tales from the Arabian Nights, with a tendency to veer into mysticism.3 The next phase in Khwaju's epicwriting is represented by his Raudat al-Anwar (" Garden of Lights ", 743/1342), an imitation of Nizami's Makh^an al-asrdr (see above, pp. 579-80); then follow two Sufi ethical mathnavis, the Kamdl-Ndma ("Book of Perfection", 744/1343-44) and the Gauhar-Ndma ("Book of the Pearl", ? 746/1345-46). A s to the Sdm-Ndma—an epic, more in the form of a courtly novel, about the ancient Iranian hero Sam—Safa favours Khwaju's author ship for a variety of reasons, although the old sources make no mention

of the work;1 Kopriilii, on the other hand, doubts its authenticity and regards it as a feeble effort. Several prose treatises are also ascribed to Khwaju; they are all written in an artificial prose style in the manner of the Maqdmas.
In spite of his reputation, Khwaju is a poet without personality; it is truer to say that he was a successful imitator of greater poets both in his lyric poetry and in the romantic and reflective mathnavi. Indeed he was so skilful at imitation that his contemporary Haidar of Shiraz accused him of plagiarism in a versified lampoon, doubtless prompted by nothing more than spiteful envy of the reputation that Khwaju was already enjoying. A remarkable exception to the general monotony of Persian poetry in this period is presented by Amir Mahmud b. Amir Yamin al-Din Tughra'i of Faryumad (this was not his actual birthplace), named Ibn Yamin for short, born in 685/1286 or 687/1288. After the death of his father, who was also a poet, he succeeded to the latter's office as a director of finance to the vizier of Khurasan in 722/1322, but this gave him no satisfaction as he was denounced by his colleagues and finally dismissed. In the unusually uncertain circumstances prevailing after the death in 736/1336 of the last ruling Il-Khan, namely A b u Sa'Id, Ibn Yamin shuttled between the courts of various rival petty pfinces. A t the Battle of Zaveh, fought between the poet's patrons, the Sarbadars of Sabzavar, and the Karts of Herat (743/1342), he lost the only manuscript of the divan he had composed during the first half of his life, and probably all his wealth as well. He was taken prisoner by the victorious Karts and remained in captivity for several years. He was not badly treated, but he had to sing his captors' praises until he managed to return from Herat to the Sarbadars at Sabzavar. He died in 769/1368 at Faryumad, where he was living a withdrawn life as a farmer.
The loss of the divan was a bitter blow; but it was not lost entirely beyond recall, because Ibn Yamin pieced it together again as far as possible from his own memory and that of his friends. In Leningrad an old manuscript is preserved in which there are also poems dating from the first half of his poetic career. Since this manuscript certainly does not contain all his poetry, it can be assumed that Ibn Yamin's total output was more than has actually survived; nevertheless 16,000 lines are a substantial amount, double the 8,000 lines in the printed

edition. He eulogized approximately sixty-five rulers, some of whom were mutual enemies, but his qasidas are all thoroughly average, often repeating themselves and full of plagiarisms. His ghazals are equally mediocre; it is in vers ^occasion (gifd) that he excels, rivalling Anvari as an exponent of this form. These short poems are the products of the inspiration of the moment, and as a result contain inconsistencies and even contraditions. In them Sufism alternates with rationalism, en couragement to activity with a desire for isolation from the world; they are, in other words, true products of their times. Ibn Yamin was in many ways a forward-looking poet, not without a touch of materialism. In these poems he attacks the feudal overlords whom he praises in his qasidas, confesses reverence for women, shows pity for the suffering, and extols the virtues of husbandry—but without ceasing to be the loyal servant of the sultans. He accepted the Shfi convictions of the Sarbadars as his creed and was amongst the earliest poets to praise the imams and Karbala. All this, together with his knowledge of rural life, renders his "fragments" important for the understanding of social and peasant life in the period, while the document itself is almost unique amongst the Persian classics. Ibn Yamin captivates the reader not with the excellence of his style but with his down-toearth ideas and his realism.
A country nobleman, Khwaja, Jamal al-Din Salman Savaji, i.e. of Saveh (b. c. 709/1309, d. 778/1376), was the last notable preSafavid panegyric writer. He eulogized the Jalayirids, though he did not hesitate to praise their temporary conquerors. Because he was a "prince of poets" and in the ruler's confidence, his favour was courted by many, and he soon acquired fame and esteem through the preciosity of his " over-artificial qasidas " written in the manner of the panegyric poet Sayyid Dhu'l-Fiqar Shirvani (d. 689/1290). This type of poetry had been in vogue before and was often to be cultivated with greater perfection afterwards, particularly by poets in the ninth/fifteenth cen tury who put Salman in the shade. A s a compensation for their lack of ideas, the writers of panegyrics pursued a line of "art for art's sake" all the more vigorously. Salman was especially skilful in his use of the double entendre. But writing of this type was chiefly a way of attracting notice at the outset of his career. He wrote works of greater literary merit when he began to think up new subjects and new metaphors. Despite this, his qasidas still contain echoes of Kama! al-Din Isma'il, of Zahir Faryabi, and Anvari, and even of the early panegyrist

Manuchihri (died c. 432/1040-41), while the great mystic poets can be recognized as the models of his ghazals. Salman wrote hymns glorifying God, the Prophet, and the imams, in particular 'All, who until then had not been praised very much in Iran; on the other hand, it cannot be maintained that Salman was an out-and-out Shi'i. Apart from these poems and other traditional forms of lyric verse, he wrote a Sdqi-Ndma ("Book of the Cup-Bearer"), which probably antedates Hafiz and was therefore one of the earliest lyric poems; a romantic epic called Jamshid u Khurshid (763/1361-62), an adaptation of Khusrau u Shirin under an other name; and a romantic tale Firdq-Ndma ("The Book of Separa tion"), written to console Sultan Uvais on the loss of his favourite; the separation was temporary at first, but after the reconciliation it was to become permanent, since his beloved died. Since the poem was based on an actual occurrence—and here Salman was following the example of Amir Khusrau—his Firdq-Ndma was to become a model for many later poets. In general Salman's works display accomplishment rather than genuine poetic fire. The praise he was given in the divan of Hafiz was based on spurious poems, though Hafiz certainly knew his works, as Salman knew those of Hafiz; and in fact their styles are so similar that some of Salman's ghazals have passed into the other's divan. His frivolous verses ("Jokes") recall those of Sa'di. 'Ubaid-i Zakani re proached him for writing in the language of women, saying he must have written his poems for his wife; nevertheless the two men became friends.
Judaeo-Persian literature lies somewhat outside the scope of this study. Towards the end of the Mongol period, Maulana Shahin of Shiraz, taking as his subjects biblical material and Judaeo-Persian tradi tions, became a kind of Firdausi or Nizaml of the Iranian Jews. Before his time translations of the Pentateuch had already been made. The Judaeo-Persian writers all used the Hebrew script exclusively. A t this point the Mongol period comes more or less to an end, and poetry moves into the age of Timur with the outstanding figure of Hafiz.
PROSE
This section does not touch on strictly scientific prose, but is confined in the first place to belles-lettres; then to prose lying on the border be tween literature and science: didactic prose with literary pretensions; and finally, historiography. Though New Persian prose has not acquired the fame of New



PROSE
Persian poetry, and with a few exceptions has not received the same notice or critical scrutiny as the poetry, it must on no account be underrated, as regards either quantity or quality. Immeasurable riches still lie hidden in manuscripts. A peculiarity of Persian literary prose, and often of scientific prose too, during this period is a tendency—to an even greater extent than in earlier periods—to approximate to poetry as the true voice of Persia. T o this end literary prose favoured a florid style and the inclusion of verse, accompanied by an increasing use of Arabic. In didactic and scientific prose the same means were used, especially in prefaces and historical works, and sometimes even to the point of including verse in the text itself. Furthermore, in literary prose rhythm and rhyme were brought into the structure of the sentence, particularly in the short story in dialogue form known as tnaqdma; indeed the whole gamut of rhetorical ornamentation and excessive Arabic borrowing were the essential features of this curious genre, and became much more important than the story itself. Tendencies of this kind had already been discernible during the Saljuq era, and Mongol rule only sharpened the taste for this ornamentation and preciosity in both literary and didactic prose. This trend, however, was not wholly uniform. Although it is indisputable that artificiality increased and that prose became highly elaborate and tended towards poetry, still there were always certain writers who cultivated simple or at least relatively chaste modes of expression. T w o currents were thus at work in the same period. While historians delighted in styles of every kind, including the most pretentious, Süfi writers in general preferred a simpler tone. History apart, bombast tended to occur most frequently in biography and literary history, essays, and epistolary writings. In these genres may be found a style which is flowery, highflown, often excessively verbose, and lacking in content sometimes to the point of utter vacuity; a style, moreover, which swelled the proportion of Arabic vocabulary in Persian to such extreme limits that only professional aesthetes were capable of understanding it.

The oldest Persian novel, Samak-icAyydr (" Samak the Magnanimous ") was written down, according to the oral tradition of Sadaqa b. Abu'lQâsim Shïrâzi, by Faràmurz Khudâdâd b. 'Abdallah Kâtib al-Arra

jani in 585/1189. It records the fabulous adventures of the various knights who courted the Emperor of China's daughter. Another novelist, Abu. Tahir Muhammad Tarsusi, whose dates are quite un certain, imitated Firdausi in the sphere of historical romance, and became famous for various prose novels based on Persian legends; his Ddrdb-Ndma has been published.1 There is also a novel by Hamid alDin Jauhari Zargar dating from the sixth/twelfth century and telling about the poetess Mahsiti; only a small number of the quatrains quoted in it, however, can be accepted as genuinely hers. Collections of anecdotes, arranged under various unifying titles, have also come down. The most important is Jawdmi' al-hikdydt va lawdm? al-riwdydt ("Necklaces of Anecdotes and Lightning-Flashes of Tales "), comprising 2,113 stories gathered by Sadid al-Din Muhammad cAufi. A descendant of 'Abd al-Rahman cAuf, one of the Prophet's companions, 'Aufi came of a cultured Transoxianian family who en gaged in literary pursuits; he was born between 567 and 572 (1171-77). He travelled widely, and worked at royal courts in Transoxiana, Sind, and finally Delhi; he seems to have had no moral scruples about changing masters. There is no further record of him after 630/1232-3 3. The collection of stories dates from the author's later years and is distinguished by its simplicity, which contrasts with the pomposity of the Lubdb al-albdb (" Quintessence of Hearts"), written in 618/1221-22. The latter, besides being more characteristic of his style, is the oldest work of its kind in Persian literature. It is a sort of history of literature or rather a collection of biographies of poets, written in a flowery style, in place of which one would prefer more facts. 'Aufi was not an out standing master of style and the importance of both works lies in their usefulness. The JawdmF al-hikdydt, a veritable fountain of anecdotes drawn from a great many sources, was in turn a source for the parables of the didactic writers and is important for this reason alone, quite apart from its occasionally valuable historical comments. In 620/1203 'Aufi made a Persian translation of Al-Faraj ba'd al-shidda (" Joy after Sorrow"), from the Arabic of the Qadi Abu 'All al-Muhsin al-Tanukhi (d. 384/994); but it has not survived. The original was again translated between 651/1253-54 and 656-73/1258-75 by Husain Dihistani Vaziri, but it is not certain whether this was in fact a new translation or simply

an adaptation of the older one; even now all the uncertainties about this so-called second translation and its author are far from having been removed. Among the collections of moralizing fables or tales incorporated in a framework, first and foremost stands Kalila u Dimna, for countless ages one of the most treasured books of the peoples of East and West; it is also known by the name "Bidpai's Fables". For present purposes, its origin lies in the excellent Arabic translation by the Persian 'Abdallah b. al-Muqaffa' (executed c. 142/759), whose text was taken from the Middle Persian adaptation by Burzoe of various Indian models. Several Persian versions were based on the translation by Ibn alMuqafiV, but they were all superseded by that of Abu'l-Ma'ali Nasr Allah, probably a native of Shiraz, who at the command of the Ghaznavid Bahram-Shah (511-52/1118-52) undertook a new adaptation. Khusrau Malik (5 5 5-82/1160-86) rewarded his ministerial services by having his executed. The versified version by Rudaki has been lost. And even Nasr Allah's work (written between 515 and 537/1131-53), which, in spite of much rhetorical ornamentation adapted to the exigencies of contemporary taste, is still a masterpiece of Persian prose by virtue of its elegance and comparative simplicity, was not to remain unscathed. The ornamentation which he gave it seemed insufficient to later writers, who outdid each other in their customary stylistic con tortions and bombast, though it is not surprising that so popular and highly valued a work should have been subject to such influences. The elegance of Nasr Allah's style became obscured and his text underwent such brutal distortion that it is virtually impossible to form any clear idea of its original state without the aid of a critical reconstruction. In or about 658/1260 Baha' al-Din Ahmad Qani'I of Tus cast Nasr Allah's version into the form of a mathnavi in the mutaqdrib metre for 'Izz al-Din Kai-Ka'us, the Saljuq ruler of Rum. The version by Husain Va'iz Kashifi entitled Anvdr-i Suhaili (" The Lights of the Canopus ") is far more blatantly rhetorical than that of Nasr Allah; but this belongs to the end of the ninth/fifteenth century.
The Mar^ubdn-Ndma, written in the Tabari dialect by Ispahbud ("Prince") Marzban b. Rustam b. Shahryar b. Sharvin around the turn of the tenth to eleventh century, provides a valuable parallel to Kalila u Dimna. Only two mutually independent N e w Persian verions have survived, both written in an over-elaborate style. These are the Mar^ubdn-Ndma by Sa'd-i Varavini of Azarbaijan, written between

607/1210 and 622/1225 and the 'Kaudatal-uqul("The Garden of Sensible Minds "), written at the end of the twelfth century, by a vizier of the Saljuqs of Rum, Muhammad b. Ghazi of Malatiya. Three works re sembling the Arabian Nights, viz. the Sindbdd-Ndma ("The Book of the Seven Viziers"), the related Bakhtiydr-Ndma ("The Book of the Ten Viziers"), and the Tutt-Ndma ("The Parrot-Book"), date from this period and were at one time extremely popular. They are collections of tales arranged within the framework of a definite " moralizing" idea (mainly that same objectionable disparagement of and disrespect for women which underlies the Arabian Nights). One collection with out any underlying idea is the Qjssa-yi Chahdr Darvish ("The Tale of the Four Dervishes "), a fantastic work strongly impregnated with the romantic spirit. The origins of these collections lie for the most part in India and Sassanian Iran, though their texts have of course under gone the most varied and colourful developments. Sooner or later they were all clothed in a more elevated prose style. The original version of Sindbdd-Ndma, written in a primitive style by Khwaja Amir al-Din Abu'l-Fawaris Qanarizi in 339/950-51, has disappeared, to gether with a poetic replica by Azraqi (d. before 465/1072); the latter was recast in a more elevated style by Muhammad al-Zahiri al-Katib of Samarqand in 5 56-57/1160-61. The oldest version of the BakhtiydrNdma, dating from the beginning of the seventh/thirteenth century, is by a certain Muhammad Daqa'iqi of Marv, to whom a version of the Sindbdd-Ndma is also attributed; it exists in several different versions, and was versified by an otherwise unknown poetaster named Panahi at the Qara-Qoyunlu court in 851/1447. The Tuii-Ndma, the anony mous original version of which has disappeared, is preserved in an "extremely tasteful new version" (Ethe) of 730/1330 by Diva al-Din Nakhshabi, as well as in shortened versions by Muhammad Khudavand Qadiri (ninth/tenth century) and Abu'1-Fadl b. Mubarak (d. 1011/ 1602-03), and in a metrical version by Hamid of Lahore. A nobler type of rhetorical art is represented by the maqdma, a true expression of art for art's sake, in the form of tales in prose inter spersed with verse about the adventures of witty vagrants, an attenu ated offshoot of the classical mime. The principal examples are in Arabic, although the creator of the genre, which was later to be brought to perfection by Hariri (d. 516/1122), is generally considered the Persian Badi' al-Zaman of Hamadan (d. 398/1007), unless chronological precedence is given to his rival A b u Bakr al-Khawarizmi (d. 383/993

of з 9311002). The Arabic works of two principal exponents of the maqdma were then imitated in Persian by the qadi Hamid al-Din (d. 5 5 9/1163-64), who employed fewer unfamiliar and recherche expressions than Hariri, and whose style was closer to that of his fellow-countryman Badf al-Zaman. After an interval came Sa'di's Gulistdn, which had its first imitation in the Nigaristdn ("Picture Gallery") by Mu'in al-Din Juvaini(735/1335).
II. Literary prose bordering on the scientific or didactic
A work of Sufi character, Asrdr al-tauhidfi Maqdmdt al-Shaikh Abu Sa'id (" The Secrets of God's Oneness on the Spiritual Stations of Shaikh A b u Sa'id"), provides valuable information about the life of the celebrated mystic who died c. 570-80/1174-85. According to this biography, written by his great-great-grandson Muhammad b. alMunavvar, Shaikh Abu Sa'id did not himself write poetry; the poems generally attributed to him must therefore be by others. The work also possesses great literary merit, and except in its introduction avoids the artificialities fashionable in the sixth/twelfth century. Shihab al-Din Suhravardi blended tasavvuf with Zoroastrian and Neo-Platonist ideas in his Arabic and Persian works, and put forward the heretical philosophy of Monism; for so doing he was executed in Aleppo in 587/1191, and he is therefore called al-Maqtfil, "the executed one", to distinguish him from other writers of the same name. His treatises in Persian are consciously artistic in style (H. Corbin calls them visionary) and are amongst the earliest allegories ever written in that language. Written in relatively simple language, these tales are remarkably effective. Other prose of this kind includes 'Attar's hagiographic Tadhkirdt al-auliyd, and the Mirsdd al-ibdd (" Observatory of God's Servants") of Najm al-Din of Ray. In the latter work, besides important and varied themes drawn from Sufism, there are valuable quotations from the poets, including the earliest reference to 'Umar Khayyam's quatrains.1 It was written at the request of the author's disciples in 618-20/1221-23 in Qaisariyya and Sivas, where he had taken refuge from the Mongol hordes. For Iraqi's Lamacdt ("Lightning Flashes") see above p. 602; three minor prose works are ascribed to Shabistari (p. 603 above); and the Arabic and Persian writings of Baba Afdal should also be mentioned (p. 603 above).
1 Arberry, op. cit. p. 252, stresses "the detailed account of the mystical commemoration {dbikr), and the curious discussion of the kinds of * light' seen in ecstasy".



POETS AND PROSE WRITERS
T o the category of didactic prose belongs the Akhldq-i Ndsiri (" Ethics of Nasir"), so called in honour of the Isma'ili Nasir al-Din 'Abd al-Rahim of Kuhistan, which was written in 633/1235-36 and is the first of three famous treatises on ethics. The author, Khwaja Nasir al-Din Tusi (597-672/1200-73), was one of Hulegii's most influential advisers, an outstanding polymath who composed innumerable scienti fic works in Arabic and Persian. He was at the same time a moralist of a very strange kind—"Professor Levy remarks that the verdict of history is a most unfavourable one"1—who was able to be of service both to the Assassins and to their Mongol enemies, and to contribute to the downfall of the last 'Abbasid, an action allegedly prompted by his Shi'i convictions. It is known that the Akhldq-i Ndsiri, and in particular its introduction, was originally composed in the spirit of his then masters, the rulers of Alamut, but was later submitted to a thorough revision under Hulegii, who had put an end to the rule of the Assassins. Nasir al-Din exonerated himself by claiming that he had written the earlier version under duress as a captive of the Assassins; in the changed circumstances, he was quite naturally at pains to conceal his past as far as possible. His writings deal with mathematics, astro nomy (a short introduction to the subject in verse is ascribed to him), cosmology, mineralogy, geography, history, the science of calendars, law, medicine, education and morals, geomancy, logic, theology, poetry, and letter-writing. When the seven hundredth anniversary of the death of Khwaja Tusi was celebrated at Tehran in 1956, the city justly honoured one of Iran's greatest geniuses. He converted his ruth less utilitarianism into an active policy and ended by making a great contribution to the relief of Persia after the Mongol catastrophe, just as Shams al-Din Juvaini did somewhat later, though the latter's motives were undoubtedly more idealistic.
A second non-fictional prose includes works concerned with literary history. The Chahdr Maqdla(" Four Treatises "), written in 5 50-51/115 557 by Ahmad b. 'Umar b. 'Ali of Samarqand, generally known by the name Nizami-yi 'Arudi, is a work of fundamental importance for the study of contemporary and earlier movements in literature. The reader must bear in mind, however, that it was written in the atmo sphere of the Ghurid dynasty, and consequently supports their attitudes and opposes those of their enemies, especially the Ghaznavids. On Rashid Vatvat's Hadd'iq al-sihr (" Magic Gardens "), see above, p. 561;

and on 'Aufi's Lubab al-albdb ("Quintessence of Hearts"), see p. 616. A work on the subject of Persian prosody, versification and poetics, attributed to Nasir al-Din Tusi, is said to be no great masterpiece. This subject received its finest treatment in al-Mufam ft ma'dyir asffdr al-Ajam ( " A n Explanation of the Criteria of the Poems of the Persians"), written between 614/1217 and 630/1232-33 by Shams alDin Muhammad b. Qais of Ray, first in Arabic and subsequently in Persian at the request of the scholars of Shiraz. Its value lies in the exactitude of the rules which it sets down and to an equal degree in many reliable quotations which it contains, often from poets whose divans have since been lost.
III. H I S T O R I O G R A P H Y
Amongst the historical works dating from the close of the Saljuq period, the following are important for their content and style. The Tarikh-i Baihaq ("The History of Baihaq") by Abu'l-Hasan 'Ali b. Zaid al-Baihaqi, called Ibn Funduq (d. 565/1169-70), must be clearly distinguished from the much earlier Tcfrïkh-i Baihaqï (" The History of Baihaqi") or Ta'rïkh-i Mas'ûdt, a history of Sultan Mas'ûd of Ghazna by Abu'1-Fadl Muhammad Baihaqi (d. 470/1077-79). O f historical importance is the Kitdb al-tawassul ila al-tarassul (" A n Exploration of the Approaches to Letter-Writing "), an epistolary collection by Bahâ' al-Din Muhammad Mu'ayyad al-Baghdâdï (d. notbefore 588/1192), which was completed in 578-79/1182-84. The Ta'rikb-t Tabaristdn ("History of Tabaristân"), was written in 613/1216 by Muhammad b. Isfandiyâr. Finally the Rabat al-sudûr wa djdt al-surûr (" Repose of Hearts and Signs of Joy", 599/1203), a history of the Saljuqs by Najm al-Din A b u Bakr Muhammad Râvandi, is " certainement un plagiat de Saljuqnama-i Zahiri [Nishapuri] puisqu'il n'y a pas un mot de plus et s'arrête absolument à la même date. Ravendi a tout simplement changé le style de Zahiri sans rien y ajouter".1 Although the Mongol invasion inevitably had a most catastrophic effect on the development of Persian culture (except in those marginal areas which remained unscathed or were in any case not Iranian), Persian historiography reached its apogee precisely during this unfortunate period; indeed the principal historical works of the Mongol period are amongst the finest ever produced by any of the Islamic

peoples. The Il-Khans were eager to have their conquests and actions immortalized and they soon found subjects who were willing to under take this task. As these writers had access to the relevant documents, especially those concerning the history of the Mongols and Turks, and as they had witnessed at first hand the events they described, they were able to provide penetrating and accurate accounts; even though they were court officials, they did not necessarily indulge in eulogies. The consolidation of the Mongol empire was the main factor in the remarkable development of Persian historiography during the thirteenth and four teenth centuries;1 other factors were the Crusades and the increase of caravan and sea trade in Asia and the Mediterranean, both of which served to tighten the political, economic, and cultural fabric of Iran and to broaden the horizon of Persian historians. The complex sentence structure and wealth of vocabulary which characterize the styles of these historians can best be seen as a legacy of the Saljuq period in its decline. T w o works in which this kind of writing is particularly evident are Nur al-Din Muhammad Nasawi's N afthat al-masdur ("Expectorations of the Consumptive") 632-37/ 1234-40, and Hasan Nizami Nishapuri's Taj al-ma'dshir ("Crown of Glorious Deeds "), which is a bombastic and superficial history of India covering the years 587-614 (1191-1217). T o this group also belongs the Tarjama-ji Yamini^ Translation of Yamini's Book ") of Abu'l-Sharaf Nasih Jarbadhaqani (early seventh/thirteenth century), which owes its rhetorical style to its Arabic original of 1021. These works are the historical counterparts of the purely literary belles lettres of the period, both reflecting a stylistic development that continued throughout the Mongol period and eventually reached the most distasteful extremes, destined in their turn to have a harmful influence on later Persian historical prose. Because of their ornamentation—a feature which un doubtedly had an aesthetic appeal to contemporary taste—factual works of this kind enter the sphere of literature. 'Ala' al-Din 'Ata Malik Juvaini (623-81/1226-83) is a typical repre sentative of this style, although he had already begun writing during the early part of the Il-Khanid period. He came of a family which had transferred its services from the Khwarazm-Shahs to the Mongols. While his brother Shams al-Din Muhammad occupied the position of a sahib-divan or finance minister to the Mongol khans, 'Ata Malik was

the governor of Baghdad and indeed a very benevolent one. The Juvainis were the leaders of a group who furthered the Mongol regime, but none of the family earned any thanks for their services; they were removed at the instigation of the Mongol nobility, who were hostile to them, and their immense wealth was confiscated. 'Atä Malik has been immortalized by his Ta'rikh-i Jahän-Gushä(" History of the WorldConqueror"), completed in 658/1260, which in three volumes deals in turn with: (a) the history of Chingiz-Khän, his ancestors and descend ants, from the first campaign to the death of the Great Khan Güyük Khan (647/1248); (b) the history of the Khwärazm-Shähs and of the Mongol viceroys in Iran until 656/1258; and (c) the entry of Hülegü into Iran in 1256-5 8 and the history of the Ismä'ills or Assassins (10901258). The author visited Mongolia and was present at the destruction of the Assassin stronghold at Alamüt, from whose valuable library he tried to save what he could. O n the basis of the (no longer extant) Sar-Gudhasht-i Sayjidnä (" Incidents in the Life of our L o r d " , i.e. Hasan-i Sabbäh, the founder of Ismäcili rule in Alamüt), he wrote a description of the fortunes of this curious sect. Juvaini was a supporter of his masters, he neither concealed nor tried to exonerate them from their misdeeds. In his inquiry into the reasons for the fall of Iran he antici pated Ibn Khaldün. Juvainl's style alternates between a greater and lesser degree of ornamental rhetoric. Rashid al-Din Fadl Allah of Hamadän (64 5 -817/1247-1318) is regarded as Persia's greatest historian. A n exceptionally cultivated man, he was originally a physician and later became vizier, a position he continued to hold until the reign of Abu Sa'id, when he was accused of poisoning the latter's father, Öljeitü, and executed. Not even the insults heaped upon his corpse could satisfy the hatred felt for him; in 1399 his remains were exhumed and reburied in a Jewish cemetery. His enormous fortune was confiscated and his library of 60,000 volumes dispersed. His letters1 provide a useful historical source, but his principal work is the JämF al-tawärikh ("Compendium of Histories"), written at the behest of Ghazan. The first part, called Ta'rikh-i Ghä^äni in honour of its sponsor, was devoted to the history of the Mongol empire and the Il-Khäns up to the death of Ghazan in 703/1304; the second part was dedicated to Öljeitü (703-16/1304-16) and is devoted

to general world history; and the third, a geography of the "seven climes ", probably either was never written or was lost at the dissolution of the author's library. The entire work, written in a comparatively simple style, is noteworthy for several reasons. The first part, which contains more detailed and comprehensive information than any com parable works, including those in Chinese and Mongolian, is particu larly valuable. The general history is not confined to the Islamic countries but looks farther east and west. In his task Rashid al-Din had the collaboration of specialists on the language or nation in question; indeed for Mongolia his authority was Ghazan himself. Their con tributions may well have been considerable, and it has even been doubted whether Rashid al-Din can really be called the author of Jdmic al-tawdrikh\ however, these doubts have been convincingly dispelled by Murtadavi.1 Rashid al-Din always takes social and economic factors into consideration. Himself a bureaucrat from the middle class and a supporter of the centralizing policies of the Il-Kháns, he opposed the particularist tendencies of feudalism, and therefore the Mongolian nomadic aristocracy. A work in which bizarre and distorted writing reaches its climax, but which is nevertheless a mine of information, is the Taj^iyat al-amsdr wa ta^Jiyat al-acsdr (" The Partition of Territories and the Lapse of Ages ") by Sharaf al-Din 'Abdalláh of Shiráz, generally called Vassaf-i Hadrat, i.e. "Court Panegyrist" (663-73 5/1264-1334). It continues the work of Juvaini, embracing the years 656-723 (1258-1323). Being a court official, Vassáf had access to the archives and therefore provides a great deal of factual detail, though unfortunately in a most intimidating manner. He himself admits that he was concerned primarily with literary effect, historical events serving merely as a basis. The work is thus an exercise in style on a lavish scale. T o judge by their lasting effect, Vassáf's extreme fondness for Arabic words and his excessively bombastic, florid, and precious style were amongst the most harmful influences on Persian prose. On social and economic matters, however, Vassáf must be regarded as an excellent authority. In his political opinions he followed Rashid al-Din, eulogizing the Mongols but never hesitating to reveal their inhumane and unjust acts. Alongside the supporters of the Il-Khans there were other historians who were outspokenly opposed to them. Apart from the Arab Ibn al-Athir (d. 630/1234), particular mention should be made of Muham

mad Nasawi (see above, p. 622) and Minháj al-Din 'Uthmán Jüzjáni (b. c. 589/1193, d. after 664/1265); and there were others of lesser significance. Views similar to Rashid al-Din's were held by another historian, Hamd Allah Mustaufi Qazvini, an advocate of centralization. His TcCrtkh-i Gualda ("Selected History") begins with the creation of the world and runs to 730/1329. In about 735/1355 he completed his immense Zafar-Ndma1 ("Book of Victories"), an imitation of Firdausi's Shdh-Ndma containing about 75,000 lines of ver^e. His third work was a cosmography and geography entitled Nu%hat al-qulüb (" Restoration of Hearts ") written in 740/13 39-40, which is outstanding for the accuracy of its dates and other facts. Works on the history of India include Diva' al-Din Báráni's Ta'rlkh-i Flrü^-SJhdhi, dealing with events during the years 1265 to 1357; the TcCrikh-i 'Aid'i of Amir Khusrau (see above, p. 609), a Ta'rtkh-i Vassdf in miniature; and Jüzjáni's general history entitled Tabaqdt-i Ndsirl (657-58/1259-60). In conclusion, it must be stressed that this survey covers only a very small proportion of the vast quantity of prose writing produced during the period. In selecting works to be discussed, I have given thought to their stylistic and other aesthetic aspects. Works confined to science, mathematics and so on, have been omitted entirely.2

CHAPTER 9
THE VISUAL ARTS,
1050-1350
The period of Iranian history covered in this discussion began with the rise of the Turkish dynasties of the Ghaznavids and of the Great Saljuqs and ended with the small Iranian or Mongol dynasties which followed and contributed to the fall of the Il-Khanid empire. The specific dates quoted above are only approximations since stylistic and thematic changes do not necessarily coincide with major historical events, but the period as a whole is one in which all provinces of Islamic Iran and all media of artistic creation underwent considerable changes and in fact established architectural, formal, iconographic, and aesthetic standards which were to remain for many centuries thereafter those of Islamic Iranian art in general. This statement is valid in the sense that the arts of the following centuries can almost always be shown to be in a definable kind of relationship to forms, ideas, and techniques created or developed between the eleventh and the fourteenth centuries. Yet, if these filiations with later centuries can indeed be established, it is far more difficult to define the relationship of this art to that of previous centuries. In fact our documentation on and conceptual framework for the arts of the first four centuries of Islamic Iranian art are so limited and so much tied to the interpretation of a few texts or to purely acci dental finds, that, with a few exceptions to be mentioned in due course, we will consider the art of Iran during the centuries under consideration as a new creation. If it is perhaps too adventurous to call it a renaissance in the sense that it does not seem to be in continuous but in revolu tionary relationship to what preceded, it is not too far-fetched to talk of an artistic explosion, for, regardless of its complexity in details, the period which produced the mosque of Isfahan, the minaret of Jam, the mausoleum of Sanjar in Marv, that of Oljeitii in Sultaniyeh, Kashan and Ray ceramics, the "Bobrinski" kettle, the Wade cup, the "Demotte" Shdh-Ndma, and the manuscripts of the Rashidiyya can by any account be considered as one of the most productive and most brilliant periods of Iranian art.

INTRODUCTION
The period is not an easy one to define properly. First, the disastrous lack of proper monographic studies—except in the case of a very few objects and buildings1—makes any generalization somewhat hazardous. Secondly, the periodization of the different artistic entities which can be defined is impossible in anything but the most general terms. T o give but a few examples, one may point out that the period of the Great Saljuqs (roughly from 1050 to 1150) is almost totally terra incognita in all but architecture, while the century which followed the death of Sanjar is tremendously rich in properly dated objects but exhibits an original architecture only in a few small monuments from areas peripheral to the Iranian world, primarily Azarbaijan, and a few cities of Central Asia. Other instances are ceramics, in which some of the most remarkable objects of the so-called "Saljuq" style were demonstrably manu factured after the Mongol conquest; and manuscripts, among which the greatest masterpiece of the fourteenth century, the "Demotte" Shah-Nama, has never found the artistic and intellectual or social milieu in which it was made. Thus it is, at this stage of our research, still almost impossible to co-ordinate properly the monuments with the events of the time; and often in trying to explain the monuments one misses the human and spiritual context in which they were made and used. Hence, even though one must be cognizant of the classical divisions of styles into a Saljuq period (roughly until the third or fourth decade of the thirteenth century) and the Il-Khanid one (roughly after the last decade of the same century), we shall in this chapter avoid these distinctions on the ground that neither the monuments nor the social and cultural history of Iran have as yet been sufficiently explained to make the time distinctions more than convenient labels for museum identification. Yet this lamentable historical vacuum is not the only methodo logical deficiency with which we have to cope. A n equally frustrating problem is posed by what may be called the geographical co-ordinate of the arts. It is clear for instance that the third, fourth, and fifth decades of the twelfth century witnessed a remarkable building activity known primarily through large congregational mosques in the area of Isfahan, that the last decades of the twelfth century and the thirteenth

century saw major constructions of mausoleums in Azarbaijan, that inlaid metalwork was developed to a particularly remarkable degree in Khurasan in the second half of the twelfth century, and that Rashid al-Din sponsored a major school of painting in Tabriz in the first two decades of the fourteenth century. In all four of these instances there is no evidence that any other part of Iran enjoyed the same developments. Should any of them then be considered as regional growths to be explained by some local needs or purposes ? Or are they purely acci dentally preserved and should a style or an idea formed in Khurasan in the middle of the twelfth century be construed as valid for the rest of Iran ? It is of course clear that each such definable group of monu ments will provide different answers to these questions. The Rashidiyya school of painting did have a greater importance in the development of Iranian art after the death of its founder in 1318 than the architectural style of Azarbaijan in the thirteenth century. Yet almost no attempt has yet been made by archaeologists or historians to separate pan-Iranian trends from local ones or to assess the exact character of any one provincial development,1 and to the questions raised almost thirty years ago by Professor Minorsky,2 scholarship has still not provided answers. These methodological and intellectual difficulties in any attempt to discover the structure—the word is used here in the sense given to it by linguists or ethnographers—around which one can explain the monu ments of Iranian art and their development makes our task of discussing them in a few pages particularly arduous. T o attempt a chronological description would take us too long and is somewhat meaningless without at least partial solutions to the questions raised in the preceding paragraphs. A discussion of techniques separately from each other would correspond to traditional methods of treating Islamic art, but its underlying assumption of separate developments for each major medium would have to be demonstrated for this particular period and in any event it would not provide a clear summary of the visually perceived world created during these centuries. Our choice, therefore, has been to avoid any attempt at total coverage but rather to select a more limited number of precise topics through which, it is hoped, one may be able to define the major characteristics of the arts of the eleventh to fourteenth centuries and also point to the problems which still need

to be solved. Three such topics were chosen: the architecture of the mosque, the objects of the twelfth-thirteenth centuries, the painting of the fourteenth century. Each of these, as we will try to show, serves as a focal point around which most of the major monuments and problems can be discussed. Much in the interpretations which will be proposed is still hypothetical, but it is our belief that only through working hypo theses can the actual significance of an insufficiently studied art properly emerge.
THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE MOSQUE
A N D ITS I M P L I C A T I O N S
The central phenomenon of the architecture of Iran during these centuries is the formation of what may be called the classical Iranian mosque. Almost its most perfect example is found in the now ruined masjid-i jum'a of Varamin (fig. i ; pis. i, 2), near Tehran. It is a rectangle, 66 by 43 metres, with a remarkably clear plan. A courtyard in the centre was lined with an internal facade; on either side lies an axial wan (definable as a rectangular vaulted hall of which one side opens directly to the outside) framed by two or four smaller arched openings. The ivans are not of equal size and the centrally planned balance of the court is overshadowed by the strong longitudinal axis of the wider ivan on the qibla side (pi. 2) which is followed by a superbly majestic dome rising high above the rest of the building. The area between Ivans is at the same time quite open for circulation and yet definable through a series of long vaults carried on square or rectangular supports. A curious sort of ambiguity remains as to whether these supports are actually piers imagined as separate entities or walls opened up by wide arches. There are three entrances to the building, each of which is a shallow ivan leading into the axial Ivans of the court. The main entrance, on the longitudinal axis, is architectonically articulated through a series of niches and prefigures the composition of the wan qiblL The medium of construction is brick throughout. Its fabric varies from place to place and thus serves at the same time as a mode of construction and as decoration. The vaults are usually pointed barrel vaults. The ivans and the zone of transition to the dome are provided with a characteristic architectonic composition known as the muqarnas. It consists of a combination—variable in structure and extent—of complete units of construction, such as half-domes and vaults, or segments thereof, used, at least in appearance, either to give variety to

variations in the fabric of construction, stucco, terra-cotta, colour faïence. Although vegetal motives do exist, the main designs are either epigraphical or geometric. The former, with their religious or historical subject-matter, serve also to identify the purpose, quality, and time of execution of the building. The latter are used to strengthen the main

lines of the building and have been used in a particularly effective fashion. Such are briefly the major characteristics of the mosque of Varamin.1 Their significance is that almost all of them were created or developed during the two and a half centuries which preceded the building of the mosque. The time of invention, history, or purpose of most of these features are still not well understood and each one deserves a separate monographic treatment. We shall limit ourselves here to a rapid discussion of some of the problems posed by the most striking identi fying characteristics of the building. The first one is the plan of a mosque with four Ivans around a court (pi. 3) and with a large dome on the axis in front of the mihrab. The establishment of this plan, which remained characteristic of Iranian archi tecture for many centuries, has been the subject of much controversy and the question of the origins of this plan demands some elaboration. It seems clear that, toward the end of the first half of the twelfth century, a whole group of cities in the western Iranian province of Jibal either acquired totally new congregational mosques or replaced older, presum ably hypostyle buildings with new ones. The reasons for these trans formations are not certain. There may have been local reasons in each instance, like the 1121-22 fire which destroyed most, if not all, of the older mosque of Isfahan. Or else these mosques simply reflected the growth in wealth and population of the province under the rule of the Great Saljuqs. Whatever the reasons, in Isfahan, Ardistan, Gulpaigan, Barsian and Zavareh,2 new mosques were erected, all of which exhibit sufficiently related characteristics of style and plan that they form a clearly identifiable architectural school. The masterpiece of this school is undoubtedly the mosque at Isfahan, but it also has a number of internal peculiarities due to the presence of older remains (to some of which we shall return) and to a particularly complicated later history.3 As a result it is perhaps less immediately useful to define typical features than it is to illustrate the higher technical and aesthetic values of the style. More typical is the

the dome appears to have been built separately and often the presently known areas surrounding the domes are considerably later than the dome itself.1 Hence there is the possibility that the large dome in the back of the traditional Iranian mosque had a history independent of that of the court with four Ivans. From this observation there has emerged the one consistent theory explaining the growth of the Iranian mosque. A . Godard has intro duced the hypothesis of a "kiosk-mosque", which originated in the single domical fire-temple of Sassanian Iran and which consisted in a single domical structure at one end of a large open space. It is only little

mosque at Zavareh (fig. 2), built in 1136. It is a simple rectangle with an unobtrusive side entrance, an appended minaret, a courtyard with four Ivans prominently contrasted in plan and elevation from the rest of the building where clearly identified piers support barrel vaults: a large dome appears behind the Ivan qibll. This basic kind of plan was imposed elsewhere on more or less complex older remains and in a more refined way appears at Varamin. But there is a further complicating factor. Whereas in Zavareh the whole building was conceived as a unit, in a number of other examples,

by little, argued Godard, that such open areas became entirely built up, and it is a peculiarity of the early decades of the twelfth century that the architects of western Iran introduced a court with four ïvàns to surround the dome. The origin of the four ïvàns is found in eastern Iran, where it is assumed to be the characteristic plan for the private house. And the reason of this impact of eastern Iran would have been the impact of the one new kind of building known to have been created in the eleventh century, the madrasa, an institution created in part for the re-education of the masses in orthodoxy and presumed to have -originated in activities carried out first in the private houses of eastern Iran.1 Such is, in a slightly simplified form, the presently accepted theory; but there is much in it which is hypothetical and uncertain. First the degree of archaeological and historical precision which is required in such hypotheses does not exist for the monuments of eastern Iran2 and the little that is known of eleventh- and twelfth-century architecture in Transoxiana and Khurasan offers no example known to me of mosques with four ïvàns.3 There is much danger in relating relatively wellknown monuments, like those of Jibâl, with far less well studied ones and, as was mentioned before, our understanding of the character of the provinces of Iran is far too uneven to allow for generalizations. Secondly, even if it is quite likely that there were instances of fire-temples transformed into Muslim oratories and that single domical sanctuaries were indeed built, it is nonetheless true that the small space thus provided is not very well suited to Muslim cultic practices, especially in larger cities. Furthermore, there is a tradition of a dome in front of the mihràb going back to the Umayyad mosque in Medina; in this instance the domed areas also served as a maqsûra (reserved area) for the caliph or his representative. It so happens that, in the case of the mosque of Isfahan, the domed room in front of the mihràb is provided with a
1 The clearest statement of the position is in A . Godard, "L'origine de la madrasah", Ars Islamica, vols, x v - x v i (1951). A n earlier but particularly acute criticism of these and other arguments for the kiosk-mosque appears in J. Sauvaget, "Observations sur quelques mosquées seldjoukides Annales Institut d'Etudes Orientales, Université d'Alger, vol. ^ ( 1 9 3 8 ) . For the madrasa as an institution, see now G . Makdisi, "Muslim Institutions of learning in eleventh century Baghdad", B.S.O.A.S. vol. x x i v (1961). 2 This is particularly true of the presumably critical madrasa at Khargird ; cf. the objections raised by K . A . C.

formal inscription giving the name of Nizam al-Mulk and thus dating it between 1070 and 1092. This together with other bits of evidence analysed by Sauvaget1 suggests that some, if not all, of these large domes had a ceremonial princely significance. Or, alternatively, all of them could have had a primarily religious and symbolic significance in emphasizing the orientation of the building and the direction of prayer. This latter point may be strengthened by the third difficulty involved in the classical scheme explaining the formation of this type of mosque. It is that the plan of the court with four Ivansitself is not particularly adapted to the ceremony of prayer. It is a centrally arranged plan revolving around a court and it does not in its simple form provide the automatic orientation which is essential in a mosque; hence the widening of one Ivan and the large size of the dome could be inter preted as necessary adaptations of a given type of plan to new purposes. Moreover, there is considerable evidence that the plan was a ubiquitous one, i.e. that it was a sort of standard arrangement which could beand was—used for many purposes. This is shown partly by its impact on regions west of Iran, but also by its occurrence in secular structures, such as the magnificent twelfth-century caravanserai of Ribat Sharaf2 or the Ghaznavid palace of Lashkarl Bazar.3 Pending further studies and especially excavations of pertinent buildings, it would seem, therefore, preferable to argue that, while the fact of the creation of a new type of mosque in the early twelfth century in western Iran is undeniable, the reasons for its creation in this particular form are not yet eludicated. Yet, even though the peculiar combinations and uses of Ivans and domes which were thus created appear as new, their immediate adaptation and their continued utilization over several centuries indicate that in some way these elements of plan and elevation struck a particularly meaningful chord in the Iranian vision of its monuments. Was it a revival with modifications of the forms of Sassanian architecture with its domes and Ivans ? Then one may indeed suggest that it was a renaissance. Or did these forms continue over the preceding centuries in ways of which we are not aware ? Then it would be more appropriate to talk of a blossoming of seeds planted earlier. Or was this new architecture the result of the impact of the new Turkish masters of political power who would have served as catalysts to the

formalization of indigenous traditions or brought new ones from the East? Then indeed these monuments may appropriately be called Saljuq.
Yet, until new research has brought answers to these questions, it may be preferable to talk more modestly of a western Iranian type of mosque plan created in a clearly defined period and with considerable impact on later centuries. Through its form in Varamin in the early fourteenth century, one can imagine the changes brought into it: strengthening of a longitudinal axis through an elaborate gateway (the pish-taq), simplification and standardization of systems of support, partial decrease in relative size of the court, more elaborate proportions between parts. The ways in which these changes were brought in and their chronology are still matters which have to await investigation. Although the plan with four Ivans became the standard plan for mosques, it should be noted that it does not define all types of mosque buildings erected during these centuries. Especially in the early four teenth century there were many instances of repairs and reconstructions in older buildings1 and a particularly noteworthy feature was that a large building like the mosque of Isfahan was subdivided into smaller units, thereby suggesting a change in the religious practices of the time and the apparent uselessness of the large early congregational mosque. More extraordinary is the one significant remaining mosque which clearly identifies the Il-Khanid imperial style. Built in Tabriz between 1310 and 13 20 by 'All-Shah, a vizier of Oljeitu, it is known today as the "Fortress", the Arg. Originally there was a large court with a pool in the centre of the building, but its main unit was an Ivan, 48 metres deep, 25 metres high, and 30 metres wide. Its walls were between 8 and 10 metres thick and its vault, which was meant to be larger than that of Ctesiphon, fell shortly after its completion.2 This astounding con struction was clearly megalomaniac and illustrates an odd variant within the traditional plan of the mosque. Next to the plan, the most significant feature of the Iranian mosque as it appears in Varamin is its construction. And here again the main threads lead back to the architecture of the twelfth century in western Iran. Although stone was used consistently in many parts of Azarbaijan and unbaked brick or rubble in mortar in more prosaic buildings,
1 There is no list available of these reconstructions but many instances can be found throughout Wilber's book and in several studies by M . Siroux, esp. in " L e masdjid-e djum'a de Y e z d " , Bull. Inst. Fr. Arch. Or. vol. XLIV (1949). 2 Wilber, pp. 146-9.

the standard medium of construction of most of Iran became baked brick. The significance of this point is twofold. On the one hand, it appeared in the late eleventh century with the domes of Isfahan as a comparatively new medium of construction in western Iran, while its sophisticated use can be demonstrated as early as in the ninth and especially tenth centuries in north-eastern Iran.1 Thus the possibility does indeed exist that the development of brick architecture was part of a possible impact of one region of Iran over the other. On the other hand, as early as the first major datable constructions of the late eleventh century, the masons of Iran used their brickwork ambiguously, in that they transformed it into a medium of decoration. As a result wall surfaces can vary from the superb nakedness of the mosque of 'AllShah in Tabriz to the involved complexity of the dome in Varamln. But the most noteworthy constructional characteristic of these centuries occurred in the development of a new and more magnificent type of dome than had been known in Iran until then. It is not only the large mihrab domes which made this development possible. In a mosque like Isfahan there were several hundred smaller domes covering the areas between Ivans; few of these have been preserved and the identifi cation of those which are of the twelfth century is another unfinished task of archaeological scholarship. Also in Isfahan there remains the probable masterpiece of early Iranian domes, the so-called north dome of the mosque (pis. 4,5), originally probably a ceremonial room for the prince's entrance into the sanctuary. But in addition the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries witnessed a remarkable spread of monumental mausoleums, some of which continued to be tower-tombs as before, while others were squares or polygones covered with cupolas.2 The greatest concentrations of the mausoleums remaining from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries are in Transoxiana and Azarbaljan, while the fourteenth-century ones are more evenly spread all over Iran.3 Many of these mausoleums had a primarily religious character and this was the time of the formation of the large sanctuaries
1 The recent discovery by D . Stronach and T . C. Young, Jr., of two eleventh-century mausoleums with extensive brick designs in western Iran will lead to new hypotheses on this subject, "Three Seljuq T o m b T o w e r s " , Iran, vol. iv (1966). 2 For the period up to 1150 see the lists and bibliographies prepared by O .

In spite of several pioneering studies,3 the exact characteristics and development of these Iranian domes are still insufficiently documented and I should like to limit myself to three features which seem to me to be of particular importance. The first one concerns the general appearance of these domes. During these centuries two separate changes were intro duced in the construction of cupolas. One is the creation of a double shell, i.e. in effect two domes more or less parallel to each other. The phenomenon is peculiar to northern and north-eastern Iran and its first appearance occurs in monuments which have been variously dated in the eleventh or twelfth centuries.4 But, while it is obvious that this

development will have considerable importance for the changes brought into domes in the fifteenth century, the exact assessment of the reasons for the invention of the double dome is more difficult to make. It should probably be connected with a general interest on the part of north-eastern Iranian architects for the lightening of the mass of the dome, both in the literal sense of making cupolas less heavy and in the aesthetic sense of giving to the upper part of the building an airier look. In this latter sense the development must be related to an equally great interest in galleries around the zone of transition which were brought to a most perfect pitch in the mausoleum of Oljeitu. While such appeared to be the primary concern of north-eastern architects, those of western Iran had to tackle the huge domes in the back of their mosques. Their major contribution was a technical one; by an imaginative use of brick ribs around which the mass of the dome was built up, they solved the problem of making large cupolas without centring, but these ribs eventually became a single mass with the rest of the dome and should not be interpreted in the same fashion as ribs of Gothic architecture. It is perhaps in the Varamin dome that these two traditions—one con cerned with alleviation of weight, the other with sureness of con struction—meet most effectively in that the general shape and massiveness of the cupola relates it to western Iranian practices of the preceding centuries, while the striking use of windows is more typical of north eastern tendencies. The second noteworthy feature of these Iranian domes is their zone of transition effecting the passage from the square to the circular base of the cupola. The technique used throughout was based on the squinch creating an octagon. In a number of instances of larger domes, an additional sixteen-sided area was provided above the octagon. However, the most striking feature of the zone of transition during these centuries was the remarkably architectonic use made of the muqarnas by western Iranian architects. The origin and the exact purpose of this combination of architectural units is not known, but it seems likely, within our present evidence, that it developed in eastern Iran in the tenth century as a primarily decorative form.1 In the eleventh century in western Iran the muqarnas acquired a more meaningful
century date is preferable to a twelfth-century one for many of these monuments. H o w ever, the discovery of the Kharraqan buildings clearly proves that the form existed in the eleventh century. 1 T h e crucial building for this problem is the T i m mausoleum, whose latest discussion is by G . A . Pugachenkova, htoriya Zodchikh U^bekistana, vol. n (Tashkent, 1963).

function as a working element in the upward movement of the dome. Logically constructed around a few basic axes of symmetry the muqarnas became the visible means by which masonry was articulated, at least as far as the viewer is concerned, for whether or not the actual thrusts from above were carried down the lines of the muqarnas is still a moot question. That an interest in the logical articulation of walls and masonries existed in Iranian architecture of the eleventh and twelfth centuries is clear from other instances as well, such as the unique structure of the piers in the north-eastern dome in Isfahan or the fascinating system of interlocking ribs in the mausoleum of Sanjar. Yet it would be wrong to consider these interests, some of which were short-lived, or the muqarnas exclusively as actual or imitative constructional devices. They were also decorative ones and, even though during the period with which we are concerned the decorative function did not always overshadow other purposes in the domes as such, it did so in façades, cornices, and other parts of buildings. Thus the fascination with transforming constructional units into decorative ones, or in the better monuments, the creation of an ambiguous balance between decorative and architectonic values clearly appears in the uses of the muqarnas as early as in the eleventh century and is continued over the next two centuries.1 On the last significant aspect of Iranian architecture at this time, we may be briefer, because this aspect has been treated with greater thoroughness than the others.2 A look at the mosques and mausoleums shows the considerable part played by various decorative techniques in the final state of the buildings. Some involved the medium of construction, others were specifically ornamental techniques, such as stucco, terra-cotta, and coloured bricks or tiles. The former two techniques are not new, but the latter appears indeed to have been a creation of these centuries, still used sparingly when compared to what will happen in later times, but portentous of a new and highly original relationship between colour and architecture. On the whole, however, the major characteristic of decoration in the large congregational

mosques is their subordination to architectural values. Rich though it may be in Varamin or the two large domes of Isfahan, its effectiveness lies in the way in which it emphasizes, strengthens, and accentuates lines and ideas of a preponderantly architectural vision of buildings. No where is this more striking than in the superb masses of the domical exteriors. Yet, while this is generally true of the congregational mosques, it is less so of mausoleums, smaller sanctuaries, or the few known secular buildings. Plr-i Baqran, near Isfahan, a small sanctuary for a local holy man dated between 1299 and 1312, is a true museum of stucco designs.1 The mausoleums of Azarbaijan carry an extensive surface decoration which all but obliterates their actual walls.2 Ribat Sharaf, a twelfth-century caravanserai, or the eleventh-century palace at Tirmidh had most of their walls covered with decorative designs and, in the former case, included even stucco imitiations of brick walls.3 And the Jam minaret (pi. 6), like several other such structures perhaps more secular than religious in purpose, also has an almost total covering of decorative designs.4 It is as though the closer one comes to the littleknown secular art of the time or to the more popular cults of saints the more brilliant and overbearing becomes the decoration, whereas the mosques maintain something of an ascetic dignity, more in keeping perhaps with the severity of official Islam. It is difficult to sum up the characteristics of the architecture of Iran during some three centuries of numerous and varied building activities. T w o major points seem to stand out. The first one is the apparent polarization in the twelfth century of major inventions in two areas: the north-east and the west, with a more minor but highly original centre developing late in the century in north-western Iran. While the contacts and influences between those centres are matters for debate, recent evidence seems to suggest that it is western Iran which created, at this time, the most unified architectural school, perhaps because it had been less developed and less creative than Khurasan in the preceding cen turies. The forms and ideas of plans and construction developed then were picked up by the Il-Khanids in the early decades of the fourteenth

century and, in conjunction with their own monumental ambitions and renewed eastern Iranian traditions, created the monuments of Tabriz, Sultánlyeh (pi. ja), and Varamin. But the permanent coagulation of a series of definitive types and techniques seems, for the most part, to have been effected around n o o in the West. The second point concerns the character of this architectural typo logy, for it established the basis of almost all later developments in Iranian art. The building with an internal facade opening a court, the rhythms of fulls and voids based on Ivans, the mighty dome, the varieties of decorative techniques modifying the surface of the wall, and, among features which were not discussed, the tall, cylindrical minarets, and, at this time less developed, the high screen-like portal, these were all to become permanent features of medieval Iranian architecture. Whatever technical or decorative novelties were intro duced in subsequent centuries, they were, for the most part, variations —sometimes far superior in actual quality and aesthetic merit—on the vocabulary of forms created in the twelfth century. That this happened altogether is more difficult to explain and, to a degree, the explanation lies in features of Iranian culture other than those of the visual arts alone. One possibility is that these immensely active centuries estab lished the formal and aesthetic system of Iranian architecture in monuments—mosques, mausoleums, caravanserais—which by their very function remained in use for many centuries and thus forced themselves by their presence as permanent models. But whatever the explanation, there is little doubt that the monumental infrastructure created in the twelfth century may truly be called the classical period of Iranian Islamic art, for it consisted of monuments magnificent in their own right and at the same time sufficiently abstract in their formal and technical components to be used for centuries to come.
THE PORTABLE OBJECTS OF THE TWELFTH
AND THIRTEENTH CENTURIES
Whereas the architecture created in the twelfth and subsequent centuries was the beginning of a fairly coherent development in which the inno vating position of the twelfth century is clearly apparent, things are far less tangible when we turn to the other arts. A s far as painting, mural or manuscript, is concerned, it is at the end of the thirteenth century that there begins a definite movement whose steps can be partly traced

and explained. T o these we shall return later. For the earlier centuries we have a few texts, some more or less understandable fragments, and a few manuscripts which still await proper analysis.1 A curious revival of monumental sculpture seems to have occurred at this time,2 but its instances are few, its genuineness not always secure, and in any case its future development limited. There is, however, one area of artistic activity where the reverse is true, i.e. a tremendous development in the twelfth-thirteenth centuries and a partial decadence in the fourteenth. It is the area of the objet d'art. Furthermore, whereas both painting and architecture are hardly known in Iran before the latter part of the eleventh century, this is not so with respect to objects. Be it in ceramics or in metalwork, glass, and textiles, as early as in the ninth century major objects were made and definable schools are identified. Thus, at least on the level of the existence of a semi-industrial manufacturing tradition, a certain continuity seems to exist and in Iran, as elsewhere in the Islamic world, there appeared a fascination, unknown since Antiquity, with the transformation of the everyday useful object into a work of aesthetic quality. Difficulties of interpretation arise, however, primarily from the enormous mass of objects which have been attributed to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Almost no museum in the world seems to lack a " Saljuq" ceramic or tile or a bronze stand in the shape of a bird. Furthermore, a rather indiscriminate scholarship abetted by the activities of clandestine commercial diggers in Iran itself, has created a terminology of styles and types based on cities or provinces—such as Ray, Gurgan, Kashan, Saveh—which only too often do not correspond to more than the alleged place of origin of the first-known objects of the given type. Finally, the lack of properly dated objects, and especially considerable uncertainty about the actual archaeological index of those objects which are dated have added to the confusion prevailing in the field, although no one can deny the aesthetic qualities and the sheer variety of the things made during these centuries nor the fact that their existence is one of the main features of the arts of this time. In view of the unsettled state of our knowledge of these objects, our remarks will be limited to three points which seem to be somewhat more

clearly definable than any attempt at the explanation of styles or at the periodization and localization of types. The first of these points involves techniques. In ceramics the most astounding variety of techniques were used in Iran: simple sgraffiato wares, moulded wares, translucent wares, underglaze painted, overglaze painted, lustre painted, and especially the so-called mincfi technique which permitted the clear fixation of many different colours on the surface of the object. Combinations of several techniques are not un known.1 A further significant development of ceramics was the tile. Sometimes used as a section in a larger frieze of consistent designs, the tile of the thirteenth century in particular was also often conceived as a single object, decoratively and iconographically self-sufficient, and it is with these that we will mostly be concerned. In metalwork, in addition to numerous gold objects, usually jewels, whose study has never been made, and a few silver ones, we encounter mostly bronze which was cast, chased, repousse, or, most characteristically for the time, inlaid with silver.2 None of these techniques, except mlna'i, were new in themselves, but there is little doubt that techniques such as mlna'i and inlaid metal were particularly developed because they allowed a greater refinement of designs on the surfaces of the objects. The time of these changes in technical emphasis can probably be set in the middle of the twelfth century. For bronze the first-known object to illustrate the change is an 1148 penbox in the Hermitage Museum,3 although the most celebrated early example is the 1163 bucket (also in the Hermitage), well known by the name of its former owner as the "Bobrinski kettle".4 For ceramics the earliest dated faience, a fragment in the British Museum, is from 1179 and we may probably assume that the main development of new ceramic techniques was probably con temporary with that of bronze.5 For other media our information is fragmentary, but the crucial ones of bronze and ceramics seem to indicate the middle of the twelfth century as the beginning of the main explosion of new types of objects. We are very badly informed on the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries. There are very few securely dated pieces and their position in the history of Iranian art is quite

unclear.1 Tentatively and barring major archaeological discoveries, we may assume then that it is after the fall of the Great Saljuqs that the manufacture of objects developed in particularly striking new ways and that until then older techniques were preserved, but the explanation of these dates is a still unsolved problem of historical scholarship. A fairly clear ending to the series of ceramics developed in the middle of the twelfth century is provided by a study of the dated examples. The bulk of the objects are thirteenth century, without apparent effect from the Mongol invasion, but only lustre-painted tiles continue through the first third of the fourteenth century. After about 1340 there is a sudden lack of dated objects until around 1400. Metalwork, on the other hand, seems to have suffered from the invasion from the East. Practically no dated Iranian pieces are known after about 1225 until the latter part of the century when new objects were made for the new masters of the Near East and eventually a distinguishable school was established in southern Iran. Even though it may be assumed that new Iranian metal work gave, in the twelfth century, a major impetus to Islamic metal work in general, it is in the Fertile Crescent and Egypt that its greatest thirteenth-century masterpieces will be made.2 There is one last remark to be made about the techniques. They also, like the monuments of architecture, have regional associations. For metalwork it is quite certain that Khurasan, or, more generally, north eastern Iran, was the main centre from which new techniques derived and in which they were pursued until the Mongol invasion. A separate school has been suggested for north-western Iran, but its existence above the artisanal level is not secure. Ceramics are more difficult to localize properly, but there it would seem clear that the major impetus was in western Iran. Kashan, of course, is the best-known centre and there is no doubt that its potters had acquired a particularly high reputation.3 The exact significance of the prominence of Kashan for the evaluation of styles and techniques and for the attribution of pieces to specific centres is less easy to determine, for potters from Kashan may indeed have worked elsewhere. But, in any event and regardless of the fact that ceramics of similar types were produced all over Iran, it seems that the new techniques and the new subjects originated primarily in western Iranian cities.

It is thus primarily with the new ceramics of the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries and the new metalwork which can be dated between c. 1150 and c. 1220 that I should like to deal in introducing the second general point to be made about these objects. Their most striking feature is their use of human and animal figures. Such representational themes existed before, but clearly in a more limited way; they were either more or less sophisticated reflexions of folk art (especially in ceramics) or a limited princely vocabulary with many Sassanian reminis cences. The peculiarity of the iconography apparent in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries is at the same time its variety and the suggestion of a meaningful visual system of images, even though we are not yet able to translate the language in its entirety. But that we are dealing at this time with a conscious fascination with the animation of the object through figures is made evident by one of the most unusual phenomena of this time, the concomitant animation of inscriptions which occurs on the objects themselves and even on a few monumental inscriptions.1 What were these scenes ? A t one extreme stand very precise iconographic subjects: an episode from the Shdh-Ndma redone in comic-strip fashion (pi. 7 b),2 the story of Bahram Gur and Azada in many forms,3 the story of Faridun (pi. 8),4 illustration of a specific (but unidentified) battle with the names of the personages involved in it,5 and, especially in tiles, a wide variety of subj ects which can be described (an animal, a man reading a scroll, the facade of a building) but whose contemporary meaning usually escapes us. A t the other extreme is found what may be called a generalized, abstract iconography, i.e. an imagery whose individual elements are easy enough to identify but whose significance on the object or for the viewer is less immediately clear. Three main cycles can be defined. One is the traditional princely cycle, with enthroned personages, male and female attendants, hunting, polo-playing, music and dancing. The cycle is usually shown in an expanded and full form on metal objects (pis. 10, 11), while one or the other of its elements occurs on ceramics, often in a very decorative fashion as frames for other subjects. Oddities and confusions do occur within the cycle, such as the backgammon players on the Hermitage kettle, but on the whole the cycle can easily be recognized and is consistent. The same is true of the second definable cycle, the astronomical one. It includes primarily the

signs of the zodiac and symbols of the planets, but a particularly interesting group probably made in Azarbaijan included also labours of the month.1 These themes are less common on ceramics but they do occur, usually on objects whose style and composition reflect metal work.2 The third cycle is more difficult to describe and it is possible that it may not be more than a variant of the princely cycle. It occurs primarily on ceramics and shows, at its simplest, one or two personages, of either sex, motionlessly sitting next to each other, or playing a musical instrument, at times near a body of water or beside a tree. The facial types are usually distinguishable by their heavy lower jaws, very simplified facial features, and narrow slit eyes.3 In a few instances, such as celebrated plates in the Freer Gallery and in the Metropolitan Museum (pi. 9), more personages are added and the possibility is suggested that these images belong to our first group of precise stories or events. Y e t these objects differ in style from those which do show precisely defined iconographic subjects and all of them are pervaded by a curious sense of immaterial reality. For reasons to be explained below, we may call this a cycle of love or of meditation. The peculiarity of these themes is that, except for the princely ones, they all seem to belong exclusively to the period between 1150 and around 1300. They almost totally disappear from later pottery, which tends to a far more limited representational vocabulary,4 and the themes of metalwork in later decades are either consciously imitative of early models or traditional in their use of princely themes. It must be added that any eventual complete survey of iconographic cycles on Iranian objects of this period should also include decorative designs which appear to be purely ornamental but may at times also have more precise meanings5 and a whole category of objects in the shape of animals, human beings, and even houses6 whose importance is as considerable as their number and as the paucity of attempts to explain them. But, even though often quite original and aesthetically spectacu lar, as a type these latter categories of objects are not as original in Iranian art as the ones we have described and the hypothesis we shall formulate presently to explain the latter may apply to them as well. Our third general point about this whole category of works of art

concerns the meaning which should be attributed to them. Regardless of their quality of execution, they were all useful objects, i.e. symbolically or actually they were meant to fulfil some function, whether it be pouring water or wine or holding flowers or sweets. It is therefore possible that in some fashion the imagery on them reflects either the precise function to which they were destined or some relationship between owner and object, or maker and owner, or giver and owner. In order to suggest the kind of relationship that was involved, a clue is provided by the inscriptions. The most common ones consist of a series of good wishes to an anonymous owner; at other times the owner is known and the object acquires a "personalized" meaning. Then there are inscriptions referring to the function of the object and wishing successful performance of the function. On ceramics are also encountered excerpts from celebrated literary texts or, more often, shorter poems dwelling in more or less successful fashion on various "themes of love, separation, happiness, well-being, but especially love.1 It is very rarely that one can find a direct and immediate correspondence between images on objects and inscriptions. However, it could be argued that the correspondence between them did not necessarily exist on a narrative and illustrative level but on some other level, just as the text and the image of a Christmas card do not necessarily relate to each other, although both reflect a series of more or less concrete sentiments accepted as being appropriate to the occasion. Since the inscriptions so consistently bring out themes of love and well-being, it may be suggested that the images should be interpreted in like fashion. N o problem is raised around interpreting in this fashion the astrological images or the zoomorphic shapes of objects, since both of these themes have had a long history of apotropaic meanings.2 Nor is the princely cycle particularly anomalous, since a semi-magical significance of power and success is traditional with any princely cycle since ancient Egyptian art. Illustrations of romances or references to well-known legendary or actual events can easily also be so interpreted. As to the theme of love or meditation, one could interpret it as a new iconography peculiar to these times and specifically related to the new development during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries of an esoteric poetry which was mystical and

religious but ambiguously used an erotic vocabulary for its deeper purposes. Such was the hypothesis suggested by R. Ettinghausen in a brilliant study devoted to a plate in the Freer Gallery.1 Its ultimate significance was that there is a series of levels of meaning at which these Iranian objects can be understood and that, in all probability, a certain ambiguity was consciously maintained in the images, in part because the visual and poetic system of the literature itself was ambi guous but also because these objects were ambiguous in themselves, partly works of art and partly implements for daily living. There is one last remark of significance to be made about the meaning of these objects. The Hermitage bucket was made for a merchant, as were a number of other known bronze objects from Iran. The excerpts from the Shdh-Ndma on the ceramics followed a popular, spoken version of the text, not the learned manuscript one. The poems are almost always in Persian. Various Sufi groups had already by that time permeated the social organizations of the cities and provided them with an esoteric vocabulary which may or may not have always been under stood at all levels of possible meaning. As a result one may draw the conclusion that it is the urban bourgeoisie of Iran which was the primary sponsor and inspirer of the astonishing development given to the beautiful object in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Parts of its themes were shared with the aristocratic milieu of princes but it is the city merchant and artisan who may be identified as the prime mover in the explosion of the art of the object. The development in Iran finds parallels in the Arab world with the illustrations of the Maqdmdt and its short-lived character can be explained by the decadence of urban life after the Mongols. As to why it was precisely in the second half of the twelfth century that this unique development took place, the question is still difficult to answer. Could it be a primary document for a shift in the power and prestige of the bourgeoisie at the moment when the strong arm of the Great Saljuqs was weakening ?

hayawdn in the Morgan Library in N e w Y o r k dated 1291, is usually considered to be the first document identifying a major stylistic change. Then the school established by Rashid al-Din (pi. 12) in the quarter of his creation near Tabriz is assumed, by the very character of its universal aspirations and the cosmopolitan position of the Il-Khanid capital, to have been a major catalyst in gathering new styles and ideas from many different sources. Out of it, with two extraordinary masterpieces, the " D e m o t t e " Shdh-Ndma divided between many collections all over the world and the Kallla and Dimna in the University Libraryj n Istanbul, a fully Iranian artistic tradition was established, although the exact dates of these two manuscripts is not known and the proposed dates vary from 1330 to the 1370's. These two unique masterpieces are usually felt to be related to a number of manuscripts dated in the 1350's, a Kallla and Dimna in Cairo and a Garshasp-Nam a in Istanbul.1 Parallel to this " h i g h " development, there is assumed a " l o w e r " or more provincial development, whose roots may go back to pre-Mongol times. It consists mostly of a group of Shdh-Ndma manuscripts, usually attributed in part to Shlràz thanks to one manuscript dated in 13 31, but it is agreed that other schools probably existed. In all of these manuscripts except perhaps the Istanbul Kallla and Dimna there always appears something experimental, as though Iranian painters were trying to discover new modes of expression and, fascinating though many of them are, these miniatures give more rarely the sense of self-assured perfection which begins later in the fourteenth century under new and different sponsors and influences. Although no absolutely definite date can be provided for the change, 1370 seems to be as good a date as any, since several fragments of that time in Istanbul clearly show a very different style.2 That, however, it is under the Il-Khànids that a new Iranian art of painting began has been fully recognized by the Iranian view of their own painting, since sixteenth-century writers clearly acknowledged that thè reign of Abu Sa'Id (1317-36) saw the birth of painting and recognized the names of two artists of the time, Ahmad Musa and Shams al-Din.3 In its general lines this schematic outline probably corresponds to the reality of historical development of painting in the first two-thirds of the fourteenth century. While there are certainly many obscure moments

in this development especially as long as there are many documents which remain both unpublished and unclearly fitted within it,1 the out line may serve as a sort of backbone which has the merit of identifying two precise strands, an imperial ll-Khanid one with cosmopolitan over tones, and several local schools, around which various miniatures or manuscripts can be arranged in a sequentially meaningful fashion. It is somewhat more difficult to relate the stylistic scheme to the political and cultural history of the time but these problems should be resolved whenever a clear picture emerges of Iranian history between the decline of the Il-Khanids around 1330 and the new Timurid order in the last decades of the century. If, then, we leave for the time being the historical problems as being as adequately stated as evidence permits,2 what remains is to try to explain what was meant by Dust Muhammad in the sixteenth century when he wrote: "It was then (the rule of A b u Sa'Id) that Ustadh Ahmad Musa.. .withdrew the covering from the face of painting and invented the kind of painting which is current at the present time."3 Since we are inadequately informed on the intellectual framework within which Dust Muhammad made his remark, it is from the manu scripts themselves that we must try to discover in what ways the painting of the fourteenth century appeared revolutionary. Without attempting to be exclusive, it seems that there are two broad areas in which this painting is both new and the first step toward the art of the following period. These are first, subject-matter and the interpretation given to it, and secondly, the more precise problems of the representation of man and of landscape. The subject-matter of Il-Khanid painting has a number of very traditional elements. The book on the usefulness of animals known in several manuscripts of the late thirteenth and of the fourteenth centuries is not by itself a new genre and instances of the same sort of illustrated books exist in earlier Islamic art. The book of Kalila and Dimna was illustrated as early as the tenth century, although we do not have any remaining manuscripts before the thirteenth. A more original case is

provided by the Shdh-Ndma and in general the epic tradition. Many of the illustrated texts had been written a long time before the Mongols; yet, until the Mongols, there is very little evidence of epic images on manuscripts (the main exception being probably the Freer beaker mentioned before,1 but even there it may be questioned whether a consecutive narrative of its type is really characteristic of manuscripts) and the little we know is that there were mural paintings with epic scenes,2 perhaps in the manner of the pre-Islamic Soghdian paintings from Panjikent. If we add to this that there are practically no known manuscript texts of the Shdh-Ndma clearly dated before the fourteenth century, it would follow that interest in and development of an epic art illustrating books on the legendary past of Iran appears to be an Il-Khanid creation, or at the very least, underwent a tremendous increase in the fourteenth century. Several reasons may be given to explain this phenomenon. One is the importance of aristocratic taste and patronage which would naturally be concerned with legendary heroes. Another may have been the rediscovery through the Mongols of the old Soghdian epic tradi tions,3 But the most compelling reason was probably the activities sponsored by the Mongol princes themselves, especially Ghazan Khan, which led to the foundation of Rashidiyya. For, as Ghazan and Oljeitu wanted to have the past deeds and mores of the Mongols recorded for posterity, they or their Persian executors had this specific aim fitted within a general world history, the Jami* al-tawdrikh. Manuscripts of this work were copied and illustrated and several examples are preserved of the presumably original group, especially those in the Edinburgh University Library and the Royal Asiatic Society, dated respectively 1306 and 1314, and in Istanbul (pi. 12). A fascination for history and the past was not limited to official sponsors and it has been recog nized that the writing of history was a major characteristic of Il-Khanid times.4 The Athdr al-bdqiya, also in the Edinburgh Library, dated in 1307-08 preserved illustrations of another compendium. It is only natural, under these circumstances, that the Shdh-Ndma, the most complete of the historical epics, be brought back into favour and

popularity and thus it is that aside from the uniquely superb "Demotte" manuscript1 we have preserved several small Shah-Namas (pi. 13) of varying quality whose detailed study still remains to be made.2 All of them can be understood as the product of an awareness of more ancient times which was in fact an ll-Khanid phenomenon. There were variations in the ways in which the past, legendary or not, was treated. The Jam? al-taivdrikh and the Athdr al-bdqiya were primarily narrative books in which precise events were depicted and, especially in the former, long lists of rulers were given. As a result we meet with a re-discovery of portraits, neither likenesses nor fictitious authors' portraits, but set types identifying certain series of kings and emperors. Then we see specific scenes illustrated, and among these a number of images are clearly derived from models from the cultures whose histories or geography were described. Thus the representation of Tibet in the Royal Asiatic Society manuscript shows personages and building of Far Eastern character, while an Annunciation in the Edinburgh Athdr al-bdqiya has Christian models. But for the most part new iconographic cycles had to be created, such as a cycle for the life of Muhammad, the first such cycle in Islamic art. This was made possible by the introduction into Iranian art of new compositional principles and of a small number of units of composition which were sufficiently flexible to be used meaningfully in different contexts and thus illustrate different subjects with a comparatively small number of elements. Among them one may distinguish a clear tripartite composi tion of each image, the groupings of personages in two's or three's to make a crowd and several variations within these arrangements, a landscape which is at the same time very simple and conscious of spatial values, a superb utilization of gestures of the head and especially of fingers, and a limited use of colour. The small number of these features lends a certain monotony to the scenes from the Jam? al-tawdrikh, a monotony which is not always alleviated by the astounding quality of the drawing. But this monotony pertains also to the literary genre that was so illustrated. What seems far more significant is that these manu scripts and the school which produced them created and popularized

a new vocabulary of forms without which later Iranian painting is not quite understandable. A s we shall see below, much of this new vocabu lary was of Chinese origin, and this is easy enough to understand if we consider the world-wide character of the Mongol empire. What seems far more important is that a court-appointed school of painting succeeded in imposing its new patterns. That it happened must be attributed to the new interest in history and to the systematic distribu tion all over Iran of Rashid al-Din's historical volumes. If we turn to the more specifically Iranian Shah-Ndmas, a clear distinction can be established between the small and more provincial manuscripts and the "Demotte" codex. The former are primarily narrative and show only to a limited degree, if at all, influences from the Rashidiyya. Their origins may well go back to pre-Mongol times and perhaps even to media other than book illustrations.1 Their quality varies, but in some of the more successful ones a rather effective result has been achieved by the puppet-like, richly coloured personages on a gold background with only limited landscape or architectural props. Only in the aesthetically less rewarding 1341 manuscript do we en counter a somewhat more developed landscape. The " D e m o t t e " Shdh-Ndma (pis. 13-15), on the other hand, is un doubtedly one of the most complex masterpieces of Iranian art. Its fiftysix known miniatures have been the subject of many discussions and con troversies about both their dates and technical problems of retouching or altogether later additions to the manuscript.2 That almost all the miniatures have been tampered with is clearly true and the original style of some of them is irretrievably lost. Yet it may be argued that on two counts essential for our discussion here practically all the miniatures can be used as evidence: the choice of illustrated subject-matter and the basic compositional pattern. In the first instance the miniatures have tended to emphasize certain subjects at the expense of others: legitimacy in large throne scenes and in specific stories dealing with the ways in which Iranian kings were discovered; the miraculous and the fantastic especially in the story of Alexander the Great (pi. 13); battles given monumental proportions either in single combats or in the dusty clash of competing armies; and especially death and mourning which inspired some of the most stunning compositions of the manuscript and which have led to the definition of one of the probable artists as a maitre du

pathétique?- A s far as compositional patterns are concerned, the striking feature of the " D e m o t t e " Shâh-Nâma, when seen in relation to the Jam? al-tawdrikh, is that, while it clearly relied on the latter for many details especially in the grouping of personages, it expanded the image both iconographically by adding more personages and a far more developed landscape and spatially by devising more complex oblique and circular compositions, by multiplying planes of action, and by diffusing excellent draftsmanship with a far more expanded palette. In short, the artist or artists of the "Demotte" manuscript transformed the purely illustrative tradition of the small manuscripts and the technically perfect narrative of the Rashidiyya ones into an intellectually and emotionally sophisticated interpretation of the Persian epic. In this sense it in augurates what may be called a heroic tradition in Iranian art, just as the Jam? al-tawârikh inaugurated a historical one.2
It is, thus, particularly unfortunate that we are still unable to define the milieu in which the manuscript was produced. Whether it should, in part, be interpreted as reviving a very ancient heroic tradition of painting almost unknown since the eighth century in Iran, whether it should be attributed to Tabriz because of its quality, of its relations to Chinese, Rashidiyya, and even western arts and also because of its interest in Iranian legitimacy, a very Mongol concern, or whether it should be related to some Iranian milieu which saw in the tragically represented fate of Alexander the Great a parallel to the Il-Khânids, these questions we simply cannot answer for the time being and yet they clearly are preliminaries to any proper understanding of the period and of its masterpiece. In discussing the subject-matter illustrated by the Jam? al-tawârikh and by the Shâh-Nâma, we have repeatedly mentioned an evolution in the representation and use of landscape, the importance of human groups and expressions, and the existence of a strong Chinese impact on some aspects of miniatures. These three features are actually closely related to each other and had a considerable impact on later Iranian painting. Therefore, they deserve some comment. The most striking feature of the 1291 manuscript of the Manafi* al ioayawân in the Morgan Library is that, next to a group of images which are relatable to thirteenth-century Arab painting with their single plane

indicated by a grassy band and their strong colouristic effects, there occurs a very different style in which ink drawing predominates, several planes are distinguished by a series of parallel or oblique lines, trees are no longer shown in their entirety, their trunks have strongly empha sized knots, some of the animals are even shown in monochrome against a bare sky. All these changes with their linear qualities and spatial concerns are clearly of Chinese origin. A n even stronger Far Eastern influence occurs in the Rashid al-Dln landscapes with the introduction of Chinese-type mountains and a greater sophistication in the use of planes and of drawing techniques. The groupings of personages also bear the earmark of Far Eastern painting,1 as do certain types of clothes, certain facial features, and the ubiquitous cloud form. These themes all remain in the " D e m o t t e " Shah-Nam a and the Istanbul Kalila and Dimna in the sense that clouds, mountains, trees, certain flowers, groupings and personages, and certain spatial arrangements based on series of lines continue to be derived from Far Eastern art. And one can agree that Chinese painting—through its accidental impact by the nature of the Mongol empire and through the deliberate recourse to Chinese painters and works of art—created, or, at the very least, considerably enlarged the formal vocabulary available from then on to Iranian painters. It can further be agreed that the Rashidiyya was one of the primary centres for the assimilation and dissemination of this vocabulary. The new vocabulary which was thus created was rapidly transformed or, more precisely, it was used for purposes and in ways which have no relation to the place of its origins. Three principal areas can be identi fied in which Iranian artists so elaborated on their models as to make them not more than characteristic details. First, a great deal of the effectiveness of Chinese spatial and figural representations was lost when themes created in large scroll paintings were translated into the language of the more restricted illustrative miniatures. The frame of the Jam? al-tawarikh miniatures often seems more like a straight-jacket and the tendency to explode the limits of the traditional miniature frame will remain a constant characteristic of fourteenth-century Iranian painting culminating in the highly original use of the margin and relations between text and image found, for instance, in the Istanbul Kalila and Dimna?1 A result of this concern with the frame of the

individual image, tied with the consistent importance of precise subject-matter, led to a growing tendency to crowd the interior of the miniature with many natural, architectural, or human and animal elements. Each one of these has probably its own story before it became a type or a cliche1 but, in many of the " D e m o t t e " miniatures, they filled almost all spaces and replaced the excitement of Chinese empty spaces (still evident in some of the earlier Persian miniatures) with the very Iranian fascination with colour. The second area of Iranian elaboration concerns more specifically landscape. A s one moves from the Jam? al-tawarikh miniatures to those of the " D e m o t t e " Shdh-Ndma or to the Istanbul Kalila and Dimna, the individual elements of the landscape—the ground with its flowers or tufts of grass, the grey mountains in which fabulous monsters live, the trees which talk—become adapted to the needs of the story; they become real actors and not merely supports for action or brilliant symbols of space. As Alexander the Great reaches the end of the world, the ground suddenly changes into a striking deformed conception of the non-world. And nothing illustrates better the tragedy of the battle between Rustam and Isfandiyar than the blossoming setting with its little genre scene in one corner and the almost chiastic arrangement of a blooming and of a dying tree in the centre of the composition (pi. 15). As these elements of the landscape increase in colourfulness and significance, they become more involved and more complex and, in an image like that of the king of the monkeys and the tortoise in the Istanbul Kalila and Dimna2 the landscape almost overshadows the incidents of the story and becomes an end in itself, but perhaps its sombre symphony of colours reflects the gruesome and cynical moral of the story. Thus, pending necessary detailed analysis, one might suggest that, as it became involved in the complexities of illustrated events, the Far Eastern vocabulary of landscape forms acquired a very Iranian nation ality and also became at the extreme limit almost an end in itself. The final characteristic feature of this painting is its transformation of man into a hero. A s early as in the Jam? al-tawarikh the tall personages in their long robes and with their slightly bent heads become the principal subjects of the illustrations. The whole conception of the "Demotte" Shdh-Ndma further emphasized the point of the importance of man in the story and the human element is quite striking in the Istanbul Kalila and Dimna, although perhaps more conventional in the provincial

small Shdh-Ndma. But, even if one may agree on the preponderance of man in the fourteenth-century painting, the ways in which it is achieved were not consistently the same. T w o main systems of representation may be identified. One may tentatively be called aristocratic. Its elongated personages are usually quiet and almost motionless, with perhaps a long finger or a slight movement of the head indicating emotional involve ment. Facial features are usually carefully drawn and outlined. A t the other extreme occurs a sort of caricatural or pathetic tradition. Bodies are grotesquely overdrawn, often shown in violent movements. But it is in faces, especially in some of the mourning faces of the "Demotte" Shdh-Ndmas or in the figures of executioners that a deformed expression serves both as a masterful vehicle for the representation of pain and horror and at times also for the ridiculous. In origin these two modes of representation may be related in part to certain Far Eastern ways; and the strangely unexplained drawings in an Istanbul album may be a later example of the caricatural style.1 A t the same time both modes hark back to obscure Iranian traditions as early as the eighth-century Soghdian ones continued in part in Central Asian painting.2 These remarks cannot be construed as providing a complete account of fourteenth-century Iranian painting. This task is impossible without many more detailed investigations than have been accomplished so far. Our attempt has been rather to focus attention on a few themes which seem to identify the first steps of a new Iranian art of painting: its relation to books and stories, its historical interest, the impact of Chinese painting as a creator of visual forms, the pre-eminence of human elements, the development of the landscape, the key position of the Rashidiyya school. There is a constant feeling in surveying these paintings of an art in "becoming", i.e. of an art in search of the themes and forms which will best express the needs and aspirations of the culture which sponsored it. But we are still too ill-informed on the character of the culture and especially on what it expected of its painting to give an adequate account of the latter's meaning. That in the process an extraordinary masterpiece like the " D e m o t t e " Shdh-Ndma could have been produced is a testimony to the vitality of the aspira tions at work and to the fermentation of ideas out of which will emerge the more classically perfect painting of the Timürids.

THE VISUAL ARTS
CONCLUSIONS
In attempting to summarize the character of the visually perceived world of Iran between 1050 and 1350, two points may be brought out as being of particular significance. First, this is the time during which Iran acquired its permanent monumental Islamic infrastructure, in the same sense that the contemporary Gothic world accomplished it for the Ile-de-France or for England. Whatever earlier religious architecture of Iran had been, it is after the growth of the monuments of the area of Isfahan in the early twelfth century and of monumental tombs every where that the more or less permanent forms of most Iranian archi tecture were established: court with Ivans, domes, and decorative techniques. However spectacular, and even at first glance revolutionary, most later developments will almost always appear as variations on themes of the twelfth century. In painting and the decorative arts, if we except the unique but com paratively short-lived art of objects on a broad social base which developed in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the principal novelty of the period consists in the first moments of the known history of Iranian painting. In this realm one cannot argue as well that the miniatures of the fourteenth century formed the permanent taste of Iranian painting. Yet later painting cannot entirely be explained without the experiments of the early fourteenth century and especially without the body of influences at work at that time and the visual vocabulary which slowly emerged out of them. Mutatis mutandis and without in any way suggesting a relation of cause and effect between the two traditions, it may be suggested that Iranian painting of the fourteenth century stands toward later painting in the same relationship as Giotto and the Inter national Style stand to the Italian Quattrocentro.

THE E X A C T SCIENCES IN IRAN
UNDER THE SALJUQS AND MONGOLS
PRE-SALJUQ SCIENCES
In commencing a description of the mathematical sciences as practised and developed in Iran during the three and a half centuries beginning with, say, 430/1038, it is useful to review accomplishments in the field up to that time. Having assessed the accumulated scientific capital available, as it were, to the mathematicians and astronomers of the period, consideration can then be given to the manner in which they maintained, enhanced, or neglected the fund of knowledge they inherited. One essential tool for any serious work, a place-value number system, had been at hand for three millennia. The calculus of sexa gesimals, which had been developed in Mesopotamia, came to the Islamic world via the Greeks. It continued to be fully exploited for numerical operations throughout medieval times. The decimal system (but without fractions) was introduced into the Middle East from India during the 'Abbasid period. It did not become a serious com petitor to sexagesimals until much later, nor was there any reason why it should. Following the Pythagorean discovery of irrational ratios, the Greeks constructed a rigorous theory of the continuum, the process entailing a clear formulation of the notion of a limit. This body of doctrine like wise was taken over by the Muslims and subjected to repeated critical examination by numerous scholars. The same goes for geometric algebra, including a systematic treatment of the quadratic equation and a few cubics, euclidean plane and solid geometry, Apollonius' work on conic sections, "analemma" methods (i.e. descriptive geometry), various categories of analogue computers, e.g. the astrolabe based on stereographic mapping, planetary equatoria, and so on. As for trigonometry, in order to obtain numerical solutions to problems on the celestial sphere, Hellenistic astronomers had worked out a cumbersome discipline involving a single tabulated function,

that of chord lengths in terms of the corresponding arcs. The basic configuration was not the triangle, but the complete quadrilateral, relations between the sides being given by Menelaos' theorem. The spherical angle as such played no role. Some time later, we do not know just when, the Indians substituted for the chord, tables of half-chords, thus introducing the sine function, the fundamental periodic function in science and technology. Long before, as a by-product of timereckoning from the height of the sun, shadow tables had appeared in various places. They were the immediate ancestors of the tangent and cotangent functions. These disparate elements were assimilated by the astronomers of the 'Abbasid empire and developed into a proper trigonometry. The now standard periodic functions of the discipline were defined, and the relationships between them explored. Extensive and precise tables of all were computed by the use of facile and powerful numerical techniques which were then new to mathematics and which were characteristic of Islamic work throughout. Shortly before the advent of the Saljuq dynasty several investigators stated and proved the plane and spherical cases of the sine theorem for oblique triangles. This made possible the abandoning of the Menelaos configuration in favour of relations involving the triangle alone, including functions of its angles as well as its sides.1 The above leads naturally to a consideration of astronomy, the only branch of natural science susceptible of both extensive and exact development in ancient and medieval times. For many centuries the most challenging astronomical problem was that of predicting, for any given time, the positions of the planets, celestial objects which in the course of years trace out curiously looped paths in the night sky against the backdrop of the fixed stars. T w o solutions to the problem of planetary motion were developed almost simultaneously in the last centuries B.C. One, the Babylonian, based upon sequences of numbers making up periodic relations now known as linear zigzag or step functions, had disappeared completely long before the rise of Islam. The other, of Hellenistic provenience, regarded the planetary paths as resulting from combinations of circular motions. Numerical results were then inferred by trigonometric calculations based on the geometric models. In the second century A . D . this type of approach culminated in

PRE-SALJUQ SCIENCES
Ptolemy's Almagest, easily the finest and most original astronomical work of antiquity. Meanwhile, some knowledge of pre-Ptolemaic Greek (and Babylonian) planetary theory had reached the Indian sub continent. There the basic geometric model was subjected to modifi cations of considerable originality by individuals whose work gives the impression that they felt far more at home manipulating numerical rather than geometric concepts.1 Sassanian Iran, thus enveloped on two sides and influenced by techniques emanating both from the eastern Mediterranean and from India, produced astronomical work of its own, of what degree of originality it is as yet difficult to say.2 In any event, three distinct and competing sets of astronomical doctrine were cultivated in the flourishing scientific centres of the 'Abbasid hegemony. There were active partisans respectively of the (Sassanian) Zlj-i Shah, the Sindhind (from Sanskrit siddhanta) and the Almagest. But in the course of time the clear superiority of Ptolemaic theory over the other two was amply demonstrated, and by the beginning of our period they had effectively disappeared from the field. The quickening of interest in astronomical theory from the ninth century A . D . on, was more than matched by activity in observational astronomy carried on predominantly at Baghdad, but also at Buyid, Ghaznavid, Samanid, and many other dynastic capitals3 stretching from Spain to Central Asia. A n incomplete count yields a. hundred and four dated observations between 800 and 1050 attested in the manuscript literature. These are mostly of equinoxes and solstices, but they include also planetary conjunctions, positions of individual planets, eclipses, and fixed star observations. For continuity this cannot touch the threehundred year span of the single Babylonian archive now being studied.4 But it demonstrates that the active cultivation of astronomy was far more widespread and intensive in the ninth and tenth centuries than at any previous time in history. The fruits of observation and theory combined were sets of numerical tables (zz/es) appearing in great profusion during the same period. Their contents run the gamut of requirements for the practising astronomerastrologer from purely mathematical tables of trigonometric functions

and tables for calculating planetary positions through co-ordinate tables of fixed stars and famous cities.1 Thus, the scientists of Saljuq Iran found their subject in a vigorous and flourishing state. What they did with it is the next consideration.
THE FOUNDATIONS OF MATHEMATICS
Throughout the Middle Ages a succession of Muslim scholars worked along two lines, one of which led them to generalize the concept of a number. The second can be thought of as an examination of the nature of euclidean geometry which, in modern times, culminated in the appearance of the various non-euclidean geometries. O f the latter, only the first faint foreshadowing occurred in Saljuq and Mongol Iran. Both are sketched herewith. Nowadays the domain of the real numbers is regarded as including various other categories of numbers: the integers, or whole numbers; the rationals, or common fractions—ratios between pairs of integers, expressible as terminating or repeating decimals; and the irrationals, expressible as non-terminating, non-repeating decimals. For the Greeks, however, the term "number" meant only a member of the infinite set 2, 3 , 4 , . . . , i.e. a positive integer greater than unity. Frequently this definition sufficed, as in the comparison of geometric entities, say the lengths of a pair of "commensurable" lines. Commensurable magni tudes are those for which a common unit can be found. For a finite set of such magnitudes the use of fractions can be avoided by choice of a unit sufficiently small. However, it had been discovered as early as the fifth century B . C . that for some pairs of easily constructed magnitudes, the diagonal and side of a square (^2:1), for instance, no such common unit can be found. In order to deal with the "irrational" ratios between such magnitudes Eudoxus worked out a definition of proportion (found in Book v of Euclid's Elements) which is equivalent to the celebrated definition of real numbers given in the nineteenth century by R. Dedekind. This involves dividing the set of all rational numbers by a " cut". Each cut constitutes a real number, and the set of all such cuts makes up the system of real numbers.2

THE FOUNDATIONS OF MATHEMATICS
Eudoxus' version of the doctrine was completely rigorous, but it excluded common fractions and incommensurable ratios from the domain of numbers, and it presented no ready means for the carrying out of operations, say multiplication, between pairs of irrationals. The early Muslim geometers resurrected and used a second definition of proportion which seems to have been known to the Greeks, but which appears explicitly nowhere in the Greek literature. In effect, it makes use of the procedure for expressing a ratio as a continued fraction. Examples are
43:19 = 2 + 1 and ^/2:1 = 1 + 1
3+1 2+1
i+i 2+1
2+ ...
If the fraction terminates the ratio is rational; otherwise it is irrational.1 The continued fraction approach has the advantage that, in the case of an irrational, cutting off the development at any stage yields a finite continued fraction which is a rational approximation to the ratio sought. In the computation of trigonometric tables the Islamic mathematicians were continually confronted with irrational ratios for which they used rational approximations, and already in pre-Saljuq times a tendency was evidenced to think of these ratios as numbers.2 The matter was carried much farther by 'Umar Khayyam (fl. 1100) in his treatise on the difficulties of Euclid's Elements.3 Like his pre decessors, he defined two irrational ratios as equal if and only if their continued fraction developments are equal. Still employing continued fractions he went on to give conditions for determining which of two unequal ratios, rational or irrational, is the greater. By showing the equivalence of his and the Eudoxian definition he was enabled to take over all the properties of proportions in the Elements. In this connexion he hypothesizes a magnitude whose ratio to a unit is to be regarded as completely abstract "connected to numbers, (but) not an absolute,
genuine number " (tcfallaqub?I-adad, la 'adadan mutlaqan haqiqiyyati). Later

in the same passage he says " regarding it (ta'tabar fihi) as a number, as we have mentioned". Thus the irrational has very nearly, but not quite, been admitted to the status of a number. Later Naslr al-Din Tusi (fl. 1250) in his trigonometrical work on the complete quadrilateral1 demonstrated the commutative property of multiplication between pairs of ratios (i.e. real numbers). He also asserts that every ratio can be regarded as a number. The topic involving the foundations of geometry has the same two protagonists just mentioned and can be dealt with more briefly. It concerns the fifth postulate of Euclid, which states that if a transversal cuts two other lines in such manner that the sum of the interior angles on the same side of the transversal is less than a straight angle, the two lines will meet on that side if produced. It had been thought since classical times that this postulate was in fact provable in terms of the assumptions of the Euclidean system, and many geometers essayed such a proof. In the same tract referred to above2 Khayyam criticizes an atttempt by Ibn al-Haitham {fl. 1000) and has a g o at the problem himself. He considers a quadrilateral ABCD, say, with equal sides AB and D C , both perpendicular to BC. This is the " birectangular quandrilateral" to which much later the name of Saccheri3 was attached. Khayyam easily shows, without using the fifth postulate, that angles A and D must be equal. Hence they both must be either (1) acute, or (2) obtuse, or (3) right angles. He then launches into the proof of a series of theorems designed to demonstrate the absurdity of hypotheses (1) and (2). If they can be demolished then (3) is valid, and (3) is equivalent to the fifth postulate. Nasir al-Din follows a somewhat different course, striving toward the same end.4 Their attempts were foredoomed to failure, for the fifth postulate is in fact independent of the others. If it is denied, and a different assertion substituted for it, a variety of geo metries result which are different from that of Euclid, but no more and no less valid than it. It may turn out, for instance, that from a point outside a given line, two distinct parallels may be drawn to it. If either hypothesis (1) or (3) is substituted for the fifth postulate, one of the two now classical non-Euclidean geometries results. This lay far in the future

and unsuspected by Khayyam and Nasir al-Din. Meanwhile they demon strated properties characteristic of these unborn disciplines. For instance, both realized that acceptance of hypothesis (i) implies that the angle sum of any triangle is less than two right angles. This is a property enjoyed by triangles in the geometry of Lobachevskii.
ALGEBRA—KHAYYAM AND THE CUBIC EQUATION
The expression Q 0
r XT+ZOOX = 2 0 X 2 + 2 0 0 0
is an example of a cubic equation. T o find a solution for it, a root, is somehow to obtain a particular number such that when x is replaced by it the resulting number on the left (the root cubed plus two hundred times the root) equals the resulting number on the right. This equation appears in a recently discovered treatise1 written by Khayyam. He shows that it is equivalent to the following geometric problem: Find a right triangle having the property that the hypotenuse equals the sum of one leg plus the altitude on the hypotenuse. He demonstrates in turn the equivalence of this with a second question in geometry; he finds a geometric solution of the equation at the intersection between a circle and a hyperbola, and a numerical solution by interpolation in trigono metric tables. This particular equation stimulates Khayyam to review the work done by others with similar problems, to make a classification of types of such equations, and to undertake the systematic solution of all. His treatise is useful as giving an indication of the methods, motiva tion, content, and background of the algebra of his time, as well as its interrelations with other branches of mathematics. In the example cited, the highest power of the unknown quantity is three. Had this highest power been a two the equation would have been a quadratic, if four a quartic, five a quintic, and so on. General pro cedures for the solution of quadratics had appeared early in the second millennium B.C. Isolated examples of cubics also had turned up centuries before Khayyam's time. Thus Archimedes, in seeking so to place a plane that it splits the volume of a sphere in a given ratio, formulated the problem in terms of a cubic equation. He, like Khayyam after him, solved it by means of intersecting conic sections. A conic section is any one of the curves (circle, ellipse, hyperbola, or parabola) formed when a circular cone is cut by a plane. The theory of

conies as developed in classical times included manifold metric pro perties. For instance, if a point moves so that its distances, x andj, from a fixed pair of perpendicular lines always satisfies the relation xj = 4, it will trace out an hyperbola. If the relation is y — x2 the point will move along a parabola. A t any intersection of the two curves both relations will be satisfied simultaneously. Hence at such a point the ^-distance will satisfy the relation xy = x(x2) = xz = 4, a cubic equation. And the distance from the point to the line is a root of the equation. In his major work in algebra Khayyam exploits this variety of technique to work out solutions for all possible types of cubic equations. In his classification, not only the equation
X
3 = 20X2+2000,
but also x3 + lox2 = zoox + 2 0 0 0
demands an approach different from the example given at the beginning of the section. This is because not only the number of terms but also the inadmissibility of negative terms affects the category of a given equation. Khayyam's solutions appear as line segments, not numbers; he is usually satisfied with a single root per equation; no negative roots are admitted. All his expressions are written out in words—the symbolism we associate with algebra still lay centuries in the future. Nevertheless Khayyam left the subject of polynomial equations in a state much farther along than that in which he found it.1
TRIGONOMETRY AND COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS
Saljuq and Mongol times are to be regarded as a period of consolidation in trigonometry rather than one of innovation. This was natural, since they followed hard after the significant forward steps taken by Abu'lWafa' al-Buzjani, Abu Nasr Mansur, and others.2 The work of these people is assembled and integrated into much earlier material in the book of Nasir al-Din referred to above,3 the Kitdb shikl al-qitd\ com

pleted in 1260. A s its name indicates, it has mainly to do with the complete quadrilateral, the basic configuration of Menelaos' spherics. However, the last of the five treatises is written with the avowed purpose of eliminating the quadrilateral from the subject in favour of the simpler triangle. The author lists the six combinations of known sides or angles of a spherical triangle under which the triangle is deter minate. He then systematically indicates the solution of each case without recourse to the Menelaos Theorem. In this sense the book is the first treatment of trigonometry (the measurement of the triangle) as such. It is a landmark also in a second sense. The subject evolved in response to a need on the part of astronomers to transform and apply in various ways the information yielded by observations of celestial bodies. Until the work of Nasir al-Din, trigonometric techniques were closely associated with problems in spherical astronomy. This did not cease in his time or later, but his book makes no reference to astronomy, and marks the emergence of trigonometry as a branch of pure mathe matics.1 Numerical analysis also received its impetus from astronomy because of the need for tables of the trigonometric and other functions en countered in solving problems on the celestial sphere. The apogee of Islamic work in computational mathematics did not occur until the Timurid period, but steady progress in the field was maintained during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. As an illustration we cite the table of the tangent function which appears in the Zij-i Ilkhani turned out at Nasir al-Din's Maragheh observatory. Up to forty-five degrees it proceeds at intervals of one minute of arc Hence there are
45 x 60 = 270 entries,
each to three sexagesimal places, which implies precision to the order of one in ten million, say. The function increases ever more rapidly as it approaches ninety degrees, so the interval between values of the argument is increased to ten minutes, up to eighty-nine degrees, and fifty minutes. The last entry in the table has five sexagesimal places. The design and carrying through of a project such as this involves much more than hiring a sufficient number of adept calculators.

THE EXACT SCIENCES
PLANETARY THEORY THE MARAGHEH SCHOOL
The earth and its sister planets of the solar system rotate in nearly circular orbits about the sun, all lying pretty much in a single plane, the ecliptic. Think of each orbit as the rim of a spinning wheel, the poet's charkh-i gardun, of which the line between sun and planet is a spoke. If, which is natural, we regard the earth as fixed, then the turning of the earth-sun spoke constrains the sun itself to move in an orbit about the earth, whilst it remains the hub of the independently rotating sun-planet spoke. N o w the planet, riding upon the rim of its own wheel, alternately approaches the earth and recedes from it as the wheel spins. A t the same time it alternately moves forward, ahead of the earth-sun spoke, thence receding behind it, and so on. This figure of wheels upon wheels provides a valid if simplified explanation for the looped paths of the planets as seen from the earth. Moreover, if the larger orbit is called the deferent {al-hdmil), the smaller, rotating upon its periphery, the epicycle (al-tadmr\ and if for the wheelspoke the modern technical term vector is substituted, the configuration becomes the standard one of ancient and medieval planetary theory. For the superior planets, those whose orbits are larger than the earth's, the deferent cannot be thought of as the orbit of the sun; nevertheless, for these planets also a deferent-epicycle combination is valid. This general approach antedates Ptolemy, as does the realization that to obtain a closer correspondence to observation it is necessary for each planet that the earth's position be slightly displaced from the deferent centre. Also pre-Ptolemaic is the notion, strongly held until the sixteenth century, that any celestial motion must be uniform and circular, or a combination of such motions. Stated in modern form, this requires that the motion of any celestial body be expressible as that of the end-point of a linkage of constant length vectors, each vector rotating at constant angular velocity, and the initial point of the first vector being at the earth. Ptolemy's observations led him to the realization that the centre of equal motion for the epicycle centre is neither the earth nor the deferent centre, but a point distinct from both, the equant {rmfaddal aI-masir). The presence of the equant in the Ptolemaic model makes possible a high degree of precision in predicting planetary positions, but it violates the principle of uniform circularity as stated above. This alleged flaw in the planetary theory was the object of criticism

PLANETARY THEORY THE MARAQJIEH SCHOOL
by many astronomers, but until Il-Khanid times no one seems to have produced a model capable of competing with Ptolemy's in terms of accuracy, and which would at the same time involve only uniform circular motions. Such a development was, however, inaugurated by Nasir al-Dln Tusi and carried through by associates of his at the Maragheh observatory. He seems to have been the first to notice that if one circle rolls around inside the circumference of another, the second circle having twice the radius of the first, then any point on the peri phery of the first circle describes a diameter of the second. This rolling device can also be regarded as a linkage of two equal and constant length vectors rotating at constant speed (one twice as fast as the other), and hence has been called a Tusi-couple. Nasir al-Din, by properly placing such a couple on the end of a vector emanating from the Ptolemaic equant centre, caused the vector periodically to expand and contract. The period of its expansion being equal to that of the epi cycle's rotation about the earth, the end-point of the couple carries the epicycle centre with it and traces out a deferent which fulfils all the conditions imposed upon it by Ptolemy's observations. A t the same time, the whole assemblage is a combination of uniform circular motions, hence unobjectionable, and it preserves the equant property, also demanded by the phenomenon itself.
Other astronomers of the Maragheh group continued work along these lines, although their results have not as yet been fully recovered. In all cases their efforts, usually successful, seem to have been to construct combinations of uniform circular motions satisfying Ptolemaic boundary conditions and preserving the equant. Among the five planets visible to the naked eye, Mercury is by far the most irregular. Hence the construction of a satisfactory model for predicting its positions offers more difficulty than does that for any other planet. After repeated efforts, made long after he had left Maragheh, Qutb al-Din Shirazi, a younger associate of Nasir al-Din, produced the equivalent of the configuration illustrated in fig. 4. It satisfies all the conditions demanded by Ptolemy for the orbit of Mercury, and as such probably marks the apex of the techniques developed by the Maragheh school. Without going into details we note that, exclusive of the epicycle radius (not shown in the figure), it involves some six rotating vectors, of which two pairs (r2r3 and r4r5) are Tusi-couples with different periods. In sketching these developments, it has been necessary to omit many

aspects of the general problem of planetary motion which were con sidered by the scientists named. For instance, the planes of all the planetary orbits diverge slightly from the ecliptic, thus giving rise to motions in latitude for which machinery must be provided. Some appreciation of the inevitable complexity of a complete model may be gained by contemplating pi. 16, reproduced from a copy of one of Qutb al-Din's books. Developments along the lines indicated did not cease with the disappearance of the Marâgheh group. The work of the Damascene astronomer known as Ibn al-Shâtir (fl. 1350) falls outside our domain geographically, though not in time. It is relevant to say, however, that he succeeded where Qutb al-Din failed, producing a lunar model free of the very serious defects in the Ptolemaic one, and in fact identical with the lunar model of Copernicus (y?. 15 20). Indeed, it has been shown that most of the Copernican planetary models are duplicates of those exhibited either by the Marâgheh scientists or by Ibn al-Shâtir. AU that is left to Copernicus is the philosophically important reintroduction of a heliostatic universe.1
OBSERVATIONAL ASTRONOMY
It is safe to say that in Saljuq Iran many astronomers were engaged in making observations, but it is impossible to give a precise description of this activity because the available sources yield incomplete and conflicting information. That Sultan Malik-Shah had a new solar calendar inaugurated is indubitable, its epoch coinciding with the day of the vernal equinox of A . D . 1079, each Nau-Ruz day thereafter to fall on the succeeding vernal equinox. However, one report states that a group of astronomers including Khayyam was commissioned to work out the calendar, and that to do so large sums were spent on an observa tory which was in operation about twenty years. A second source claims that the king proposed a programme of observations, at which the astronomers demurred and suggested the calendar as a counter-proposal, the implication being that no observatory was involved. The Nauru%

Näma} spuriously attributed to Khayyam himself, says that MalikShäh brought learned people from Khurasan, and had instruments constructed, such as the mural (quadrant ?) and the armillary astrolabe, but the author gives no indication that he himself took part. The place of the observatory is moot, conjectures locating it at various cities ranging from Marv to Baghdad.2 A certain Abu Ja'far Muhammad,3 in describing his own operations to determine the solar parameters carried out at Amul states that Malik-Shäh ordered observations in Isfahan in 1083. Al-Khäzini, in the introduction to his al-Zij al-Sanjari (completed in 1115 and named after the son and successor of Malik-Shäh), has a description of several astronomical instruments and observational technique. He mentions no observations under Malik-Shäh, however. It is reported that in 1130 observations were under way at the Saljuq palace in Baghdad by Abu'l-Qäsim al-Asturläbi, but they were never completed. In contrast to the above, information on the same subject for the Mongol period is ample and accurate. The installation at Marägheh set up by Nasir al-Din under the patronage of Hülegü can be called the first astronomical observatory in the full sense of the term. Founded in 1259 and endowed with ample funds, it continued in operation for some years after the death of its first director. The professional staff included about twenty well-known scientists drawn from many parts of the Islamic world, and at least one Chinese mathematician. They were housed in imposing buildings and had the use of a very large library. The instruments were constructed under the direction of a Damascene, Mu'ayyid al-Din al-'Urdi.4 They included a mural quadrant, an armil lary astrolabe, solsticial and equinoctial armillaries, and a device having two quadrants for simultaneous measurement of the horizon co ordinates of two stars. Upon juxtaposing the descriptions by al-'Urdi and Tycho Brahe5 of the instruments constructed by each, one is inevitably struck by the strong similarities between the work of the two men. In terms of the results obtained, however, the contrast is very marked. Brahe's un

precedentedly precise observations enabled Kepler to make funda mental advances in theory, whereas we have seen above that observa tion played no role in the Maragheh work in planetary theory. Further more, it can be shown (as charged by al-Wabkanwi)1 that the planetary mean motion parameters in Nasir al-Dln's Zij-i Ilkhdm have been taken over from the earlier work of Ibn al-A'lam, hence they were not based on work at Maragheh. And these determinations require no elaborate instruments at all. After the death of Hulegu, later rulers of the same dynasty also sponsored astronomical work. Ghazan is said to have built a minor observatory at Tabriz.2 It was probably from this centre that a Byzantine text3 relays a lunar eclipse report from Tabriz in 1295, and a solar eclipse the next year. Working successively under Oljeitu and Abu Sa'Id, al-Wabkanwi reports planetary conjunctions observed in 1286, 1305, and 1306.
MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY
In order to predict the positions of celestial objects as observed from his own station, the astronomer must know the position of his locality with respect to the base co-ordinates and epoch of the tables he is using. In response to this need, most medieval zijes give lists of cities, together with their latitudes and longitudes. A partial collection involving thirty such tables runs to about 2,500 localities in Asia, Africa, and Europe.4 Only one of these tables dates from the Saljuq period, but about a third of the total seem to have been put together in Il-Khanid Iran. Localities appearing most frequently in all the sources are concentrated in Iran and Central Asia. On the basis of this it can be inferred that this time was the peak of activity in this particular field, perhaps as a result of the excellent communications maintained by the Mongol bureaucracy. On the other hand, a count was made of localities listed in five or more tables including the Zij-i Ilkhdm but not before. This yielded only twenty-nine place-names, of which only Qara-Qorum, Besh-Baliq, and Farghana are easily identifiable Central Asiatic centres.

SPECIFIC GRAVITY DETERMINATIONS
Archimedes had discovered that whenever a heavy object is immersed in a liquid its apparent weight is decreased by the weight of whatever amount of the liquid it displaces. This fact was used by him in his celebrated investigation of the purity of Hieron's gold crown. The same principle is easily applicable to the calculation of the specific gravity of substances heavier than water, the ratio between the weight of any quantity of the substance and the weight of an equal volume of water. A succession of Muslim physicists, from the time of the caliph al-Ma'mün on, developed varieties of balances for such determinations. The work was continued in Saljuq times by Khayyam, a certain Abu Hätim al-Muzaffar al-Isfazäri, and 'Abd al-Rahmän al-Khäzini, the author of al-Zij al-Sanjari. Al-Khäzini has left an account of these researches in a work called Kitäb mi^än al-hikma.1 The title of the book is the name of the main instrument it describes, a balance equipped with five pans, two of which were suspended from the same point on one side of the balance arm, the lower pan being immersed in water. Moreover, the other side of the balance arm bore a set of marks, one for each of the varieties of substance to be tested. T w o of the remaining pans could be slid along this balance arm so as to be suspended at will from any one of the marks. The fifth pan was suspended at a fixed point on the arm, its distance from the knife-edge fulcrum being equal to that of the double pan on the other side. Suppose now that a piece of metal were presented, alleged to be of, say, pure gold. One of the movable pans is suspended, empty, at the mark for gold; the sample is placed in the upper (air) pan of the double pan arrangement, and the sample is weighed in the usual manner. The sample is then transferred to the submerged pan, i.e. it is now weighed under water, and the weight which counter-balanced it in the fifth pan is transferred to the pan suspended at the mark for gold. If the instrument still balances, the sample indeed has the specific gravity of gold.

Large portions of the text had previously been published, translated, and commented upon by N . Khanikoff, as " B o o k of the Balance of Wisdom", J.A.O.S. (i860), pp. 1-128. The subject has been extensively studied by Eilhard Wiedemann
and his associates. See, e.g. Sitzungsberichte der physikalischmedi^inischen Sozietät %u Erlangen, vol. XL (1908), pp. 133-59, which lists other papers. A short treatise on the balance by Khayyam is published in the Traktatz, op. cit. note 10.

SPECIFIC GRAVITY DETERMINATIONS
If a mixture of two substances is presented, say an alloy of gold and silver, its composition is determined as follows. Set one of the two movable pans at the gold mark and the other at the silver mark. N o w place the sample in the air balance and weigh it in the usual manner. Then transfer the sample to the water pan, and remove from the fifth pan the weight which counterbalanced the sample in air. Place part of this weight in the pan at the gold mark and the rest in the silver mark pan, in such manner that the instrument balances. The division of this weight is the proportion of gold to silver in the sample. Implicit in the above is a reasonably precise knowledge of the specific gravity of any material to be assayed, and tables of such specific gravities are given in the texts, most of the constants stemming from al-Biruni. Also implicit is the realization that densities are affected by temperatures. The whole is an elegant application of theory to practise, typical of the Muslim medieval penchant for scientific instruments of many varieties.
RAINBOW THEORY
In antiquity a few individuals, notably Aristotle and Seneca, had attempted explanations of rainbow formation, but with little success. However, considerable progress was made in the study of more general optical problems, notably the phenomena of reflexion and refraction. In the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries this knowledge was applied independently in Western Europe and in Iran by investi gators who made strikingly similar advances in rainbow theory. This involved a realization that (i) the effect is produced by the behaviour of rays of sunlight falling upon spherical droplets of water, and (2) that this behaviour is a combination of refractions and reflexions after the ray has entered the drop. Kamal al-Dln al-Farisi (d. c. 1320) studied at Maragheh under Qutb al-Dln Shirazi, the latter previously mentioned in connexion with planetary theory. Qutb al-Dln himself does not seem to have written extensively on optics, but his leading ideas were seized upon by Kamal al-Dln and developed in detail in a very extensive reworking of the optics (Kitah al-mand^ir) of Ibn al-Haitham (/?. 1000). In so doing, Kamal al-Din simulated experimentally the behaviour of sunlight falling upon raindrops by the use of a spherical glass container filled with water. This he suspended in a dark room, and he then proceeded to study the directions taken by an isolated ray of sunlight admitted through

a hole in such manner as to impinge upon the sphere. Thus he showed that the primary rainbow is the result of two refractions and one reflexion within the drop, while the secondary bow arises from two refractions and two reflexions. The same conclusions were reached at almost the same time by Theodoric of Freiberg, whose work also was based on that of Ibn alHaitham. Because of a lack of a measure of refraction equivalent to SnelPs law, the results obtained both in Europe and in the Orient were qualitative rather than quantitative. Both Kamäl al-Dln and Theodoric sought to explain the colours of the rainbow, both unsatisfactorily.1
THE STATE OF THE SUBJECT—THE SOURCES
Any broad survey such as this is ultimately dependent upon scientific writings produced during the period under review. Many such works, known to have been written, are no longer extant. Their absence would be felt more, however, if those sources which have survived had been completely exploited. On the contrary, most of the available Arabic and Persian scientific manuscripts have not been read in modern times, much less studied, and those texts which have been published are to a great extent the results of chance encounters. The current general picture may be altered significantly with the study of any additional text. For instance, the existence of the non-Ptolemaic planetary models discussed above was uncovered in the course of a few hours casual browsing in the Bodleian in order to kill time after a particular group of other manuscripts had been examined. A number of topics are known to have been cultivated during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, but it is not presently possible to say whether they originated at this time or whether they had been passed on from earlier times or other regions. A n example is furnished by the Dasiür al-mtmajjimin^2 an astronomical and chronological anthology put together by some member of the Ismä'IlI sect, and perhaps part of the

library found by Hulegii at the taking of Alamiit. This describes several interpolation schemes employing second-order difference sequences to fill in values for an arbitrary function between given tabular values. Another such method1 is described in the Zij-i Asbrafz, written in Shiraz early in the fourteenth century. A n anonymous manuscript, probably written after the time of Khayyam, gives a solution for a particular quartic equation,2 and the presumption is that additional work wTas done in this field. An anonymous and undated manuscript probably composed in Iran or Central Asia during the latter part of the eleventh century employs a certain period relation between days and anomalistic months to give auxiliary tables for determining solar and lunar true positions. The period relation used is also found in Seleucid cuneiform tablets, Greek papyri, and Indian texts dating from the fourth century A . D . Hence its appearance in an Arabic text gives one of the few instances where the ancient "arithmetic methods" (as contrasted with the employment of functions of continuous variables) were taken over by Muslim scientists. A t the same time, the unknown author combined with his application of the period relation a highly intelligent exploitation of the Ptolemaic lunar model and the facile computational technique characteristic of his time.3 Because the Muslim calendar is a strictly lunar one, the methods for predicting the evening of first new moon visibility were of interest to Islamic astronomers. Some twenty-two different solutions to this problem have thus far been encountered in the literature, ranging from simple applications of a linear zigzag function to others (like that of al-Khazini in the al-Zij al-Sanjari) employing a high degree of mathe matical sophistication. Many of these are of unknown provenience, but many stem from Saljuq and Mongol times.

AN ASSESSMENT
If a frequency plot is made against time of the output of medieval astronomical tables arranged by geographical place of origin1 it will be seen that, beginning already with the tenth century, the path of the centroid commences veering east from the region of Baghdad. By A . D . I I O O the distribution is clustered on the Iranian plateau, where it remains for the next four centuries. The tables plotted represent only one genre of scientific writing. Nevertheless, in them are embodied the results of observation and theory, of astronomy and mathematics. The plot conveys about as true an impression of scientific activity during our period as can presently be expected. From its position of strength Iran exported science to the regions adjoining it. A certain Orthodox bishop, resident in Tabriz in 1295 translated al-Zij al-Sanjari and al-Zij al-Ald^iinto Greek upon his return to Constantinople.2 His work was basic in the revival of astronomy then taking place in the Byzantine Empire. It is known that Chinese astro nomers assisted Nasir al-Dln at the Maragheh observatory, and that their presence facilitated intensive study of the Chinese and Uighur calendars3 on the part of Islamic scholars. But it is also known from Chinese records, that, at the request of the Great Khan Qubilai, a Muslim astro nomer, a certain Jamil al-Dln, was sent to Pekin with drawings or models of instruments of the Maragheh type to be used at the imperial observa tory there.4 The Zij-i Ilkhdni of Nasir al-Dln was translated from its original Persian into Arabic for use in the Arab world. The process going on in Byzantium, China, and the Arab regions was also taking place in India. In the fourteenth century the Tughluq sultan of Delhi maintained a translation service. Among the works he had put into Sanskrit was a Muslim treatise on the astrolabe, and doubtless other scientific books were translated. In Western Europe, particularly Spain, the twelfth century was the time of translations from Arabic into Latin, although many of the translations (such as the %ij of al-Khuwarizmi) were based on theories by then long obsolete in the Middle East.

In contrast, we have noted significant advances in the foundations of mathematics, algebra, optics, and planetary theory. That these achieve ments were of a lesser order than those of Archimedes, and that their consequences were incomparably less significant than the scientific breakthrough which followed the work of Newton and Leibniz is perhaps irrelevant. The scientists of Saljuq and Mongol Iran were the best of their age.

The bibliographies printed below are selective and incomplete. Their purpose is not to list all publications that bear directly or indirectly on the subject, but to enable readers to carry further the study of selected topics. A later volume in this series (vol. 8) will present at much greater length a syste matic bibliography. As a rule, books and articles superseded by later publica tions have not been included, and references to general treatises not directly relevant to the subject-matter of individual chapters have been reduced to a minimum. Within the limits set by these principles, contributors were free to compile bibliographies as they thought best. The "layout" of the lists, therefore, varies from chapter to chapter. The editor did not even find it desirable to produce a uniform method of abbreviating references to learned periodicals. Form of presentation is, therefore, the decision of the individual author.

CHAPTER 5
Bibliographical information is given throughout the notes to this chapter. Marshall G. S, Hodgson, Order of Assassins (discussed in note i on p. 42 3), has been translated into Persian by Faridun Badra'I as Firqa-ji Isma'iliyya (Tabriz, 1964). The translator had trouble finding the exact equivalent of the English wording, and some of his hijri dates are merely from a date-table and so incorrect, but he worked conscientiously and has made precisions in some details. See now also Bernard Lewis, The Assassins (London, 1967).

CHAPTER 9
General
Beside general, and usually unsatisfactory, works on Islamic art, the only truly usable introduction to the art o f Iran is to be found in A . U . Pope, ed., A Survey of Persian Art, 6 v o l s . ( O x f o r d , 1 9 3 9 ) , p a r t l y o u t o f d a t e . F a m i l i a r i t y

w i t h t h e c o n t e n t s o f t h r e e p e r i o d i c a l s is a l s o e s s e n t i a l : Ars Islamica, 1 6 v o l s . ( 1 9 3 4 - 5 1 ) ; Ars Orientalis, 6 v o l s , t o date ( 1 9 5 3 - 6 6 ) ; Athâr-é Iran, 4 v o l s . (1936-49). For recent literature it is possible to keep up to date through the Abstracta Islamica p u b l i s h e d e v e r y y e a r b y t h e Revue des Etudes Islamiques.
Architecture
P h o t o g r a p h s a n d b r i e f i n t r o d u c t i o n s c a n b e f o u n d i n A . U . P o p e , Persian Architecture ( N e w Y o r k , 1 9 6 5 ) a n d D . H i l l a n d O . G r a b a r , Islamic Architecture and its Decoration, 2 n d e d . ( L o n d o n , 1 9 6 7 ) . M o s t i m p o r t a n t articles o r s p e c i a l studies will be found quoted there or in the notes to the pertinent chapter in this volume. Special mention should be made of recent efforts in Iran to provide systematic surveys, city by city, of the major monuments of the c o u n t r y . A n e x c e l l e n t e x a m p l e is t h a t o f L u t f a l l a h H u n a r f a r , Ganfina-yi äthär-i ta'fîkh-i Isfahan (Isfahan, 1964).
Painting
T h e most convenient introduction to the subject is provided by B . Gray, Persian Painting (Geneva, 1 9 6 1 ) , w i t h a n e x c e l l e n t b i b l i o g r a p h y . A m o n g m o r e r e c e n t p u b l i c a t i o n s t w o m e r i t s p e c i a l a t t e n t i o n : E . J. G r u b e , Muslim Miniature Paintings ( V e n i c e , 1962) a n d B . W . R o b i n s o n , Persian Miniature Painting (London, 1967). Both are exhibition catalogues which do not claim completeness but which are provided with important commentaries on exhibited paintings.
Decorative Arts
There is at present no convenient introduction to the ceramics, metalwork, glass, or textiles of the centuries under consideration in this volume and one would have to begin with the specific studies quoted in our notes. Some important preliminary remarks may be found in Charles K . Wilkinson, Iranian Ceramics ( N e w Y o r k , 1963) a n d D . B a r r e t t , Islamic Metalwork in the British Museum ( L o n d o n , 1949).
