Guardian of the ancient mysteries, the
keeper of secrets... For thousands of
years the Great Sphinx of Egypt has
gazed towards the east, his eyes focused
on eternity, reading a message in the
stars that mankind has long forgotten.
And today, as our civilisation stands
poised at the end of a great cycle, it is a
message that beckons insistently to be
understood.
AJl the clues are in place. Geology and
archeo-astronomy have already indicated
that the lion-bodied Sphinx may be vastly
older than Egyptologists currently
believe, dating not from 2500 BC, but
from 10,500 BG - the beginning of the
astrological Age of Leo. We now know,
too, that the three pyramids of Giza,
standing on high ground half a mile to
the west of the Sphinx, are not merely
the tombs of megalomaniac Pharaohs
but form a precise map of the three stars
of Orion’s belt in 15 million tons of
solid stone.
So is somebody trying to tell us
something? And, if so, what?
In Keeper of Genesis, Robert Bauval
(author of The Orion Mystery) and
Graham Hancock (author oiFingerprints
of the Gods) present a tour deforce of
historical and scientific detective work,
using sophisticated computer simulations
of the ancient skies to crack the
millennial code that the monuments
transcribe, and set out a startling new
theory concerning the enigmatic
Pyramid Texts and other archaic
Egyptian scriptures.
These texts serve as an ingenious
treasure trail and, as the authors
continued on back flap...

To the memory of my father Gaston Bauval,
who rests in the land of Egypt.
Robert G. Bauval
To my friend, John Anthony West, for his twenty years of
courageous work to prove the geological antiquity of the
Sphinx, and for the vast implications of the evidence that he
has put before the public. ‘The truth is great and mighty,’ as
the ancient texts say. ‘It hath never been broken since the time
of Osiris.’

Chapter i
Horizon Dweller
‘There is scarcely a person in the civilized
world who is unfamiliar with the form and
features of the great man-headed lion that
guards the eastern approach to the Giza
pyramids.’
Ahmed Fakhry, The Pyramids, 1961
A gigantic statue, with lion body and the head of a man, gazes east from
Egypt along the thirtieth parallel. It is a monolith, carved out of the
limestone bedrock of the Giza plateau, two hundred and forty feet long,
thirty-eight feet wide across the shoulders, and sixty-six feet high. It is
worn down and eroded, battered, fissured and collapsing. Yet nothing else
that has reached us from antiquity even remotely matches its power and
grandeur, its majesty and its mystery, or its sombre and hypnotic
watchfulness.
It is the Great Sphinx.
Once it was believed to be an eternal God.
Then amnesia ensnared it and it fell into an enchanted sleep.
Ages passed; thousands of years. Climates changed. Cultures changed.
Religions changed. Languages changed. Even the positions of the stars in
the skies changed. But still the statue endured, brooding and numinous,
wrapped in silence.
Often sand engulfed it. At widely separated intervals a benevolent ruler
would arrange to have it cleared. There were those who attempted to
restore it, covering parts of its rock-hewn body with blocks of masonry.
For a long period it was painted red.
By Islamic times the desert had buried it up to its neck and it had been
given a new, or perhaps a very old, name: ‘Near to one of the Pyramids,’
reported Abdel-Latif in the twelfth century, ‘is a colossal head emerging
from the ground. It is called Abul-Hol.’ And in the fourteenth century El

Makrizi wrote of a man named Saim-ed-Dahr who ‘wanted to remedy
some ofthe rehgious errors and he went to the Pyramids and disfigured the
face of Abul-Hol, which has remained in that state from that time until
now. From the time of this disfigurement, also, the sand has invaded the
cultivated land of Giza, and the people attribute this to the disfigurement ofAbul-Hol.’
Enduring memories
Abul-Hol, the Arabic name for the Great Sphinx ofEgypt, is supposed by
most translators to mean ‘Father of Terror’.
An alternative etymology, however, has been proposed by the
Egyptologist Selim Hassan. During the extensive excavations that he
undertook on the Giza plateau in the 1930s and ’40s he uncovered
evidence that a colony of foreigners - ‘Cananites’ - had resided in this part
of Lower Egypt in the early second millennium bc. They were from the
sacred city of Harran (located in the south of modem Turkey near its
border with Syria) and they may perhaps have been pilgrims. At any rate
artefacts and commemorative stelae prove that they lived in the immediate
vicinity of the Sphinx - worshipping it as a god under the name Hwl}
In the Ancient Egyptian language, bw means ‘place’. Hassan therefore
reasonably proposes that Abul-Hol, ‘is simply a corruption of bw Hwl,



Horizon Dweller 5
“the Place of Hwr\ and does not at all mean “Father of Terror”, as is
generally supposed’.^
When speaking of the Sphinx, the Ancient Egyptians frequently made
use of the Harranian derivation Hwl^ but they also knew it by many other
names: Hu^ for example, and Hor-em-Akhet—wihich means ‘Horus in the
Horizon’/ In addition, for reasons that have never been fully understood,
the Sphinx was often referred to as Seshep-ankh Atum, ‘the living image of
Atum^ Atum-Re the self-created sun-god, the first and original deity
ofthe ancient Egyptian pantheon. Indeed, the very name ‘Sphinx’ that has
haunted the collective subconscious of the Western world since Classical
times, turns out to be no more than a corruption - through Greek - of
Sheshep-ankh.
In this way, with subtlety, a number of very archaic ideas, once held by
the ancient Egyptians, have survived for thousands of years.^ Would we
not be foolish, therefore, to ignore entirely the lingering tradition that
associates the Sphinx with a great and terrible riddle?
Stillness and silence
Crouching in the massive horseshoe-shaped trench of bedrock out of
which it was carved, the statue looks old: a fierce and raddled towering
monster, higher than a six-storey building and as long as a city block. Its
flanks are lean, deeply scalloped by erosion. Its paws, now covered with
modem repair bricks, are substantially worn away. Its neck has been
clumsily shorn up with a cement collar intended to keep its grizzled head
in place. Its face, too, is bmised and battered, and yet it somehow seems
serene and ageless, unpredictably portraying different moods and
expressions at different times and seasons, coming alive with patterns of
light and shadow cast by scudding clouds at dawn.
Wearing the elegant nemes head-dress of an Egyptian Pharaoh, it gazes
patiently into the east, as though waiting for something - waiting and
watching, lost in its ‘stillness and silence’ (in the words of the Roman
naturalist Pliny), and targeting for ever the equinoctial rising point of the
sun.
How long has it stood here inspecting the horizon?
Whose image does it portray?
What is its function?



6 Enigmas
In our search for answers to these questions we have found ourselves
drawn into strange and unexpected areas of research. Like souls on the
way of the dead, we have had to pass through the dark kingdom of the
ancient Egyptian afterworld, to navigate its narrow corridors, flooded
passageways and hidden chambers, and to confront the fiends and demons
lurking there. Using computer simulations we have journeyed back in
time to stand beneath skies more than 12,000 years old, and watched Orion
cross the meridian at dawn as Leo rose resplendent in the east. We have
immersed ourselves in archaic rebirth texts and myths and scriptures and
found amongst them the veiled remnants of a remarkable ‘astronomical
language that can, without too much difficulty, be read and understood today.
Through clues expressed in this language we believe that we are able to
identify with certainty who and what the Sphinx really is. Moreover, as we
shall see in Parts III and IV, this identification appears to open a window
on a forgotten episode in human history when the waters ofa great deluge
were ebbing and men sought to transform themselves into gods. In our
opinion the stakes are high. Indeed we think it possible that the Sphinx
and the three great Pyramids may offer knowledge of the genesis of
civilization itself Our immediate aim in Parts I and II, therefore, is to
undertake a complete re-evaluation of all these titanic monuments, of the
scholarship that has surrounded them during the past century or so, and of
their numerous neglected, geodetic and geological and astronomical qualities.
Once these factors are taken into account a new Rosetta Stone begins to
emerge, expressed in architecture and time, in allegories and symbols, and
in specific astronomical directions and co-ordinates that tell the seeker
where to look and what he might hope to find.
Meanwhile the Great Sphinx waits patiently.
Keeper of secrets.
Guardian of mysteries.



Chapter 2
The Riddle of the Sphinx
''Sphinx, mythological creature with a lion’s
body and human head . . . The earliest and
most famous example in art is the colossal
recumbent Sphinx at Giza, Egypt, dating
from the reign of King Khafre (4th dynasty,
r.2575-2465 BC). This is known to be a
portrait statue of the King ..
Encyclopaedia Britannica
There is a belief that the Great Sphinx of Giza was fashioned during that
period ofEgyptian history classified as the ‘Old Kingdom’ on the orders of
the Fourth Dynasty Pharaoh named Khafre whom the Greeks later knew
as Chephren and who reigned from 2520-2494 bc. This is the orthodox
historical view and readers will find it reported in all standard Egyptologi¬
cal texts, in all encyclopaedias, in archaeological journals and in popular
scientific literature. In these same sources it is also repeatedly stated as fact
that the features of the Sphinx were carved to represent Khafre himself
in other words, its face is his face.
Thus, for example. Dr I. E. S. Edwards, a world-renowned expert on
the monuments ofthe Giza necropolis, tells us that although the face ofthe
Sphinx has been ‘severely mutilated’: ‘it still gives the impression ofbeing
a portrait of Khafre and not merely a formalised representation of the
king.’*
In a similar vein Ahmed Fakhry, professor of ancient history at Cairo
University, informs us that: ‘as it was first conceived, the Sphinx
symbolised the king, and its face was carved in Khafre’s likeness.’^
The only problem - at any rate without access to a time machine - is
that none ofus, not even distinguished Egyptologists, is really in a position
to say whether or not the Sphinx is a portrait or likeness of Khafre. Since
the Pharaoh’s body has never been found we have nothing to go on except
surviving statues (which might or might not have closely resembled the



8 Enigmas
king himself). The best known of these statues, an almost unsurpassable
masterpiece of the sculptor’s art carved out of a single piece of black
diorite, now reposes in one of the ground-floor rooms of the Cairo
Museum. It is to this beautiful and majestic representation that the
scholars make reference when they tell us — with such confidence—that the
Sphinx was fashioned in Khafre’s likeness.
This confidence was particularly apparent in an article in the
prestigious National Geographic magazine which appeared in the US in
April 1991, and a similar one that appeared in Britain in the Cambridge
Archaeological Journal in April 1992.^ The articles were written by
Professor Mark Lehner, of Chicago University’s Oriental Institute, who
used ‘photogrammetric data and computer graphics’ to ‘prove’ that the
face of the great Sphinx was that of Khafre:
Zahi Hawass, Director General of the Giza Pyramids, invited me to join his
excavation [around the Sphinx] in 1978. During the next four years I led a
project to map the Sphinx in detail for the first time. We produced front and
side views with photogrammetry, a technique using stereoscopic photography
. .. Computers have taken the records further. Maps were digitized to make a
3-D wireframe model; some 2.6 million surface points were plotted to put
‘skin’ on the skeleton view. We have constructed images of the Sphinx as it
may have looked thousands of years ago. To create the face, I tried matching
views of other sphinxes and pharaohs to our model. With the face of Khafre, the Sphinx came alive . . .'' ’
It all sounds technically very impressive and persuasive. After all, who in
their right mind is going to argue with ‘2.6 million surface points’ based on
‘stereoscopic photography’ and ‘photogrammetry’.?
Behind the technical jargon, however, the truth is rather less awe¬
inspiring. A close reading shows that all that Lehner did in order to
reconstruct’ the face of the Sphinx was to prepare a computerized three
dimensional wireframe skeleton on which he then superimposed the face
of Khafre. This is admitted in the National Geographic article, which
reproduces a photograph of the diorite statue of Khafre above the
following caption: ‘The author [Lehner] used this face for the computer reconstruction of the Sphinx.’^
So what Mark Lehner really did was to remodel the face ofthe Sphinx on
a computer according to his own preferences - in much the same way that
some ancient Egyptians had probably done several times before him on the
face ofthe statue itself The present features ofthe Sphinx, in other words.



The Riddle of the Sphinx 9
are no more likely to be those of Khafre than they are to be those of a
number of other Pharaohs — Thutmosis IV, for example, or Amenhotep,
or Ramesses II (who is last known, as Lehner admits, to have ‘extensively
reworked’ the monument at around 1279 bc)/ The simple, honest truth is
that during the thousands of years of the Sphinx’s existence, often with
only its head protruding above the sand, almost anyone could have worked
on its face at almost any time. Moreover, Lehner’s own photogrammetric
study has thrown up at least one piece of evidence which is highly
suggestive of major recarving: the Sphinx’s head, he writes, is ‘too small’
in proportion to the body. He tells us that this is because it is an early
prototype of the later very popular (and always proportionate) sphinx
form, and speculates that ‘the Fourth Dynasty Egyptians may not [yet]
have worked out the canon of proportions between the royal head with the
nemes headdress on the hon body’.’ He does not consider the equally valid
and more intriguing possibility that the head was once much larger - and
perhaps even leonine, and that it was reduced in size by recarving.
Probably relevant in this regard is an additional observation that Lehner
has made: ‘a subtle discrepancy’ exists ‘between the axis ofthe head [ofthe
Sphinx] and that of the facial features’* - the head being orientated
perfectly to due east, and the features swivelled somewhat to the north of
east.
Once again this is an error that is consistent with the recarving ofa much
older and heavily eroded statue. And it is consistent, too, as we shall see
later in this chapter, with new geological evidence concerning the
Sphinx’s antiquity. Setting these matters aside for the moment, however,
it seems clear that the mere fact that Mark Lehner is able to graft an image
of Khafre onto the battered visage of the Sphinx by means of the ‘ARL
(Advanced Research Logic) Computer and the AutoCad (release 10)
graphics apphcation’,’ proves nothing more than that with good computer
graphics you can make anyone’s face look like anyone else’s face. ‘The
same computer technique,’ in the words of one outspoken critic, ‘could be
used to “prove” the Sphinx was really Elvis Presley . ..'“
It was partly in an attempt to resolve this impasse that a group of
independent researchers took the unusual step of bringing a detective to
Egypt in 1993. The detective in question was Lieutenant Frank Domingo,
a senior forensic artist with the New York Pohce Department, who has
been preparing ‘identikit’ portraits ofsuspects for more than twenty years.



lo Enigmas
As a man who knows and works with faces every day of his’professional
life, he was commissioned to make a detailed study of the points of
similarity and difference between the Sphinx and the Khafre statue.
Months later, after returning to his lab in New York where he undertook
careful comparisons of hundreds of photographs of the two works,
Domingo reported:
After reviewing my various drawings, schematics and measurements, my final
conclusion concurs with my initial reaction, i.e. that the two works represent
two separate individuals. The proportions in the frontal view, and especially
the angles and facial protrusion in the lateral views convinced me that the Sphinx is not Khafre . .
So on the one hand we have a top forsenic expert, Frank Domingo, telling
us that the Sphinx’s face does not represent Khafre’s face. And on the
other we have Mark Lehner, the Egyptologist computer buff, saying that
only with Khafre’s face does the Sphinx ‘come alive’.
Undatable, anonymous
Why is there room for such widely varying opinions concerning the
world s best known and most intensively studied ancient monument.?
In 1992, in two different forums, Mark Lehner made somewhat
contradictory statements which hint at the answer to this question:
1 At the annual meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science he said: ‘There is no direct way to date the
Sphinx Itself because the Sphinx is carved right out of natural rock.”^
2 In the Cambridge ArchaeologicalJournal wrote: ‘Although we are
certain that the Sphinx dates to the Fourth Dynasty, we are
confronted by a complete absence of Old Kingdom texts which mention it.’’^
To deal with the first point first, it is a simple matter of fact that no
objective test presently exists for the accurate dating of rock-hewn
monuments.''^ Many people are under the erroneous impression that the
radio-carbon technique could be used, but this is not so: it is only
applicable to organic materials (in which it measures the quantity of the
isotope Carbon-14 that has decayed since the death of the organism in
question). Since the Sphinx is made of carved rock it cannot be dated by this method. ^



The Riddle of the Sphinx ii
This brings us to the second point. Stone monuments can be dated with
reasonable accuracy if there are contemporary texts which refer to their
construction. Ideally, in the case of the Sphinx, what one would require
would be an inscription carved during the Fourth Dynasty and directly
attributing the monument to Khafre. As Mark Lehner admits, however,
no contemporary text referring to the Sphinx has ever been found.
In all honesty, therefore, what confronts us at Giza is an entirely
anonymous monument, carved out of undatable rock, about which, as the
forthright Egyptologist Selim Hassan wrote in 1949, ‘no definite facts are
known’.
One syllable
Why, therefore, do Mark Lehner and other influential modem scholars
continue to link the Sphinx to Khafre and to insist that ‘The Old Kingdom
Fourth Dynasty date for [its] origin ... is no longer an issue’
One reason is a single syllable carved on the granite stela which stands
between the monument’s front paws and which has been taken as proof
that Khafre built the Sphinx. The stela, which is not contemporary with
the Sphinx itself, commemorates heroic efforts by the Pharaoh Thutmosis
IV (1401-1391 Bc) to clear the Sphinx completely ofencroaching sand and
describes the lion-bodied statue as the embodiment of ‘a great magical
power that existed in this place from the beginning of all time’.*’ The
inscription also contains, in line 13, the first syllable-of the name
Khafre. The presence of that syllable, in the words of Sir E. A. Wallis
Budge, is: ‘very important for it proves that. . . the priests of Heliopolis
who advised Thutmosis to undertake the work of clearing away the sand
from the Sphinx believed that it was fashioned by Khafre . . .’**
But does the syllable Khafreally prove so much.?
When the stela was excavated by the Genoese adventurer Gian Battista
Caviglia in 1817, line 13 - which has now entirely flaked away - was
already badly damaged. We know of its existence because, not long after
the excavation, the British philologist Thomas Young, a leading expert in
the decipherment of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, was able to make a
facsimile of the inscription. For line 13 his translation reads as follows:
‘. . . which we bring for him: oxen . . . and all young vegetables; and we



12 Enigmas
shall give praise to Wenofer.. . Khaf. . . the statue made for Atum-Hor
em-Akhet.
On the assumption that Khaf was Khafre’s name, Young added the
syllable Re between square brackets to show that a lacuna had been filled
in.^” In 1905, however, when the American Egyptologist James Henry
Breasted studied Young’s facsimile he concluded that a mistake had been
made: ‘This mention of King Khafre has been understood to indicate that
the Sphinx was the work ofthis king - a conclusion which does not follow;
[the facsimile of] Young has no trace of a cartouche ..
In all the inscriptions ofancient Egypt, from the beginning to the end of
Pharaonic civilization, the names of kings were always inscribed inside
oval-shaped signs or enclosures known as ‘cartouches’. It is therefore
extremely difficult to understand how on the granite stela between the
paws ofthe Sphinx the name ofas powerful a king as Khafre - or indeed of
any other king - could have been written without its pre-required cartouche.
Besides, even if the syllable Khaf was intended to refer to Khafre, its
presence does not necessarily imply that he built the Sphinx. It is equally
possible that he was being commemorated for some other service. For
example, like many Pharaohs after him (Ramesses II, Thutmosis IV,
Ahmoses I, etc., etc. ) — and perhaps like many before him too — is it not
possible that Khafre was a restorer of the Sphinx.^
As it happens, this perfectly logical deduction and others like it were
favoured by a number ofthe leading scholars who pioneered the discipline
of Egyptology at around the end of the nineteenth century. Gaston
Maspero, for example. Director of the Department of Antiquities at the
Cairo Museum, an acclaimed philologist of his time, wrote in 1900:
The stela ofthe Sphinx bears, on line 13, the [name] ofKhafre in the middle of
a gap . .. There, I believe, is an indication of [a renovation and clearance] of
the Sphinx carried out under this prince, and consequently the more or less
certain proofthat the Sphinx was already covered with sand during the time of his predecessors . .
This view is supported by the text ofanother roughly contemporary stela,
the so-called ‘Inventory Stela’ - also found at Giza but arbitrarily assumed
by the majority of modem Egyptologists to be a work of fiction - which
states that Khufu saw the Sphinx. Since Khufu, the supposed builder of
the Great Pyramid, was Khafre’s predecessor, the obvious implication is



The Riddle of the Sphinx 13
that Khafre could not have built the Sphinx.^"^ Encouraged by this
testimony, Maspero at one point went so far as to propose that the Sphinx
could have existed since the times of the ‘Followers of Horns’, a lineage of
pre-dynastic, semi-divine beings whose members were believed by the
ancient Egyptians to have ruled for thousands of years* before the
‘historical’ Pharaohs. Later in his career, however, the French Egyptolo¬
gist modified his opinion to conform with the general consensus and stated
that the Sphinx ‘probably represents Khafre himself
That Maspero should have felt compelled to recant his heretical views
on the Sphinx tells us more about the power of peer pressure within
Egyptology than it does about the quality of evidence concerning the
antiquity and attribution of the monument itself. Indeed, the evidence
underpinning the prevailing consensus is extremely slim, resting not so
much on ‘facts’ as on the interpretation that certain authorities have chosen
at one time or another to give to particular and usually highly ambiguous
data — in this case the solitary syllable of Khafre’s name on the Thutmosis
stela.
Very few senior members of the profession have been as honest about
such matters as Selim Hassan. In his classic 1949 study of the Sphinx,
from which we have already quoted, he issued this pertinent warning;
Excepting for the mutilated line on the granite stela of Thothmosis IV, which
proves nothing, there is not a single ancient inscription which connects the
Sphinx with Khafre. So sound as it may appear, we must treat this evidence as
circumstantial until such a time as a lucky turn of the spade will reveal to the
world definite reference to the erection of this statue . .
Context
Since Hassan wrote there has been no such ‘lucky turn of the spade’.
Nevertheless the conventional wisdom that the Sphinx was built by
Khafre, circa 2500 BC, remains so strong and so all-pervasive that one
assumes there must be something else behind it other than the disputed
resemblance to the statue of Khafre in the Cairo Museum and the
contradictory opinions of scholars concerning a half-ruined stela.
According to Mark Lehner, there is indeed something else - a kind of
magic bullet which he clearly regards as powerful enough to kill any
niggling doubts and questions. Today the Director of the Koch-Ludwig



14 Enigmas
Giza Plateau Project, and former Director of the now completed Giza
Mapping Project, Lehner is recognized as a world expert on the Sphinx.
Whenever he fires his magic bullet at the occasional ‘heretics’ who have
suggested that the monument might be a lot older than 2500 BC, therefore,
he does so from a position of great influence and authority.
The name ofhis magic bullet is context and, at the 1992 annual meeting
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, where he
was selected as the official spokesman of Egyptology to put the orthodox
point of view in a debate on the true age of the Sphinx, he made extensive
use of this ‘bullet’:
The Sphinx does not sit out alone in the desert totally up for grabs as to ‘how
old is the Sphinx?’. The Sphinx is surrounded by a vast architectural context
which includes the Pyramid of Khufu [better known as the Great Pyramid],
the Pyramid ofKhafre [‘the second Pyramid’] and the Pyramid ofMenkaure,^
pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty. Each pyramid has a long causeway running
from a Mortuary Temple on its eastern side, down to the level of the Nile
flood-plain, where a Valley Temple served as an entrance to the pyramid complex. ..
Officials and relatives of the pharaohs built their tombs in cemeteries east
and west of the Khufu Pyramid, and southeast of the pyramids of Khafre and
Menkaure respectively. Digging at Giza for nearly two centuries, archaeolo¬
gists have retrieved an abvmdance ofmaterial [dating to the Fourth Dynasty].
Hundreds of tombs have yielded the mortal remains and artifacts of people
who composed the state administration of the Pyramid Age . . . We are
discovering evidence of the working class and everyday life of the society that
built the Sphinx and pyramids... We have evidence ofthe ruins ofan ancient
city spread out along the valley for the entire length of the Giza Plateau. AU
this is part of the archaeological context of the Sphinx . .
Lehner goes on to say that there are several specific reasons why this
context persuades him that ‘the Sphinx belongs to Khafre’s Pyramid complex’:
The south side of the Sphinx ditch forms the northern edge of the Khafre
causeway as it runs past the Sphinx and enters Khafre’s Valley Temple. A
drainage channel runs along the northern side of the causeway and opens into
the upper south-west corner of the Sphinx ditch, suggesting the ancient
quarrymen formed the ditch after the Khafre causeway was built. Otherwise
they would not have had the drain empty into the ditch. Khafre’s Valley
Temple sits on the same terrace as the Sphinx Temple. The fronts and backs



The Riddle of the Sphinx 15
of the Temples are nearly aligned, and the walls of both are built in the same style . .
The evidence for the two Temples, the causeway and the second Pyramid
all being part of one architectural unit with the Sphinx is indeed
compelling. But using this evidence to support the conclusion that Khafre
built the Sphinx is rather less so. What it ignores is the possibility that the
entire ‘unit’ could have been built long before Khafre’s time by as yet
unidentified predecessors and then reused — perhaps even extensively
restored - during the Fourth Dynasty.
It is this possibility — not precluded by any inscriptions and not ruled
out by any objective dating techniques - that has made the Sphinx the
subject of an increasingly virulent controversy during the 1990s . . .
Water erosion
The origins of this controversy go back to the late 1970s when John
Anthony West, an independent American researcher, was studying the
obscure and difficult writings of the brilliant French mathematician and
symbolist R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz. Schwaller is best known for his
works on the Luxor Temple, but in his more general text. Sacred Science
(first published in 1961), he commented on the archaeological implica¬
tions of certain climatic conditions and floods that last afflicted Egypt
more than 12,000 years ago:
A great civilization must have preceded the vast movements of water that
passed over Egypt, which leads us to assume that the Sphinx already existed,
sculptured in the rock ofthe west cliffat Giza that Sphinx whose leonine body,
except for the head shows indisputable signs of aquatic erosion.^*
Schwaller’s simple observation, which nobody appeared to have taken any
notice of before, obviously challenged the Egyptological consensus
attributing the Sphinx to Khafre and to the epoch of 2500 BC. What West
immediately realized on reading this passage, however, was that, through
geology, Schwaller had also offered a way ‘virtually to prove the existence
of another, and perhaps greater civilization antedating dynastic Egypt
and all other known civilizations - by millennia’:^^
If the single fact of the water erosion of the Sphinx could be confirmed, it
would in itself overthrow all accepted chronologies of the history of
civilization; it would force a drastic re-evaluation of the assumptions of



16 Enigmas
‘progress’ - the assumption upon which the whole of modern education is
based. It would be difficult to find a single, simple question with graver
implications . .
Not floodwaters
West is right about the implications. If the weathering patterns on the
Sphinx can be proved to have been caused by water - and not by wind or
sand as Egyptologists maintain — then there is indeed a very serious
problem with estabUshed chronologies. In order to understand why, we
need only remind ourselves that Egypt’s climate has not always been as
bone dry as it is today and that the erosion patterns to which West and
Schwaller are drawing our attention are unique to the ‘architectural unit’
that Lehner and others define as the ‘context’ of the Sphinx. From their
common weathering features - which are not shared by the other
monuments of the Giza necropolis - it is obvious that the structures
making up this unit were all built in the same epoch.
But when was that epoch.?
West’s initial opinion was that:
There can be no objection in principle to the water-erosion of the Sphinx,
since it is agreed that in the past, Egypt suffered radical climatic changes and
periodic immdations — by the sea and (in the not so remote past) by
tremendous Nile floods. The latter are thought to correspond to the melting of
the ice from the last Ice Age. Current thinking puts this date at around 15,000
BC, but periodic great Nile floods are believed to have taken place subsequent
to this date. The last of these floods is dated around 10,000 BC. It follows,
therefore, that ifthe great Sphinx has been eroded by water, it must have been
constructed prior to the flood or floods responsible for the erosion . .
The logic is indeed sound ‘in principle’. In practice, however, as West was
later to admit, flood or floods’ could not have been responsible for the
peculiar kind of erosion seen on the Sphinx:
The problem is that the Sphinx is deeply weathered up to its neck. This
necessitates 60-foot floods (at a minimum) over the whole ofthe Nile Valley. It
was difficult to imagine floods of this magnitude. Worse, if the theory was
correct, the inner limestone core-blocks of the so-called Mortuary Temple at
the end of the causeway leading from the Sphinx had also been weathered by



The Riddle of the Sphinx 17
water, and this meant floods reaching to the base of the Pyramids - another
hundred feet or so of floodwaters . .
Floodwaters, then, could not have eroded the Sphinx. So what had.?
Rainfall
In 1989 John West approached Professor Robert Schoch of Boston
University. A highly respected geologist, stratigrapher and paleontologist,
Schoch’s speciality is the weathering of soft rocks very much like the
limestone of the Giza plateau. Clearly, says West, he was a man who ‘had
exactly the kind of expertise needed to confirm or rebut the theory once
and for all’.''
Schoch was at first sceptical of the idea of a much older Sphinx but
changed his mind after making an initial visit to the site in 1990. Although
he was unable to gain access to the Sphinx enclosure he could see enough
from the tourist viewing platform to confirm that the monument did
indeed appear to have been weathered by water. It was also obvious to him
that the agency of this weathering had not been floods but ‘precipitation’.
‘In other words’. West explains, ‘rainwater was responsible for
weathering the Sphinx, not floods . . . Precipitation-induced weathering
took care of the problem in a single stroke. The sources I was using for
reference talked about these floods in conjunction with long periods of
rains, but it hadn’t occurred to me, as a non-geologist, that the rains, rather
than the periodic floods, were the actual weathering agent. .
As we have noted, Schoch got no closer to the Sphinx on his 1990 visit
than the tourist viewing platform. At this stage, therefore, his endorse¬
ment of West’s theory could only be provisional.
Why had the geologist from Boston not been allowed inside the Sphinx
enclosure.?
The reason was that since 1978 only a handful of Egyptologists had
been granted that privilege, with all public access closed off by the
Egyptian authorities and a high fence built around the site.
With the support of the Dean of Boston University, Schoch now
submitted a formal proposal to the Egyptian Antiquities Organization,
requesting permission to carry out a proper geological study ofthe erosion
of the Sphinx.



18 Enigmas
A rude interruption
It took a long time, but because of his eminent institutional backing,
Schoch’s proposal was eventually approved by the EAO, creating a
brilliant opportunity to get to the bottom of the Sphinx controversy once
and for all. John West immediately set about putting together a broadly
based scientific team, including a professional geophysicist. Dr Thomas
L. Dobecki, from the highly respected Houston consulting firm of
McBride-Ratcliff & Associates.^* There were also to be others who joined
unofficially: an architect and photographer; two further geologists; an
oceanographer and a personal friend ofJohn West’s, film-producer Boris
Said. Through Said, West had arranged to ‘record the ongoing work in a
video documentary which would have wide public appeal’r'^
Since we could expect nothing but opposition from academic Egyptologists
and archaeologists a way had to be found to get the theory to the public, ifand
when Schoch decided the evidence warranted full geological support. Otherwise it would simply be buried, possibly for good ..
As a way of getting the theory of an ancient rainfall-eroded Sphinx to the
public. West’s film could hardly have been more successful. When it was
first screened on NBC television in the United States in the autumn of
1993 it was watched by 33 million people.
But Aat is another story. Back in the Sphinx enclosure the first
interesting result came from Dobecki, who had conducted seismographic
tests around the Sphinx. The sophisticated equipment that he had
brought with him picked up numerous indications of ‘anomalies and
cavities in the bedrock between the paws and along the sides of the
Sphinx’.'*^ One of these cavities he described as:
a fau-ly large feature; it’s about nine metres by twelve metres in dimension, and
buried less than five metres in depth. Now the regular shape of this
rectangular - is inconsistent with naturally occurring cavities ... So there’s some suggestion that this could be man-made.^^
With legal access to the enclosure. West recalls, Schoch, too:
was swifdy dropping conditionals ... The deeply weathered Sphinx and its
ditch wall, and the relatively unweathered or clearly wind-weathered Old
Kingdom tombs to the south (dating from around Khafre’s period) were cut
from the same member of rock. In Schoch’s view it was therefore geologically
impossible to ascribe these structures to the same time period. Our scientists



The Riddle of the Sphinx 19
were agreed. Only water, specifically precipitation, could produce the
weathering we were observing . .
It was at this crucial moment, while the members ofthe team were putting
together the first independent geological profile of the Sphinx, that Dr
Zahi Hawass, the Egyptian Antiquities Organization’s Director-General
of the Giza Pyramids, fell upon them, suddenly and unexpectedly, like the
proverbial ton of bricks.
The team had obtained their permission from Dr Ibrahim Bakr, then
the President of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. What they had
not known, however, was that relations between Bakr and Hawass were
frosty. Neither had they reckoned with Hawass’s energy and ego. Fuming
that he had been bypassed by his superior, he accused the Americans of
tampering with the monuments:
I have found out that their work is carried out by installing endoscopes in the
Sphinx’s body and shooting films for all phases of the work in a propaganda
. . . but not in a scientific manner. I therefore suspended the work of this
imscientific mission and made a report which was presented to the permanent
commission who rejected the mission’s work in future . .
This was putting it mildly. Far from ‘suspending’ their work, Hawass had
virtually thrown the American team off the site. His intervention had
come too late, however, to prevent them from gathering the essential
geological data that they needed.
When did it rain?
Back in Boston, Schoch got down to work at his laboratory. The results
were conclusive and a few months later he was ready to stick his neck out.
Indeed to John West’s delight he was now prepared fully to endorse the
notion of a rain-eroded Sphinx - with all its immense historical
implications.
Schoch’s case, in brief - which has the full support of palaeo
climatologists - rests on the fact that heavy rainfall of the kind required to
cause the characteristic erosion patterns on the Sphinx had stopped falhng
on Egypt thousands of years before the epoch of 2500 BC in which
Egyptologists say that the Sphinx was built. The geological evidence
therefore suggests that a very conservative estimate ofthe true construction



20 Enigmas
date of the Sphinx would be somewhere between ‘7000 to 5000 bc
minimum’.''*
In 7000 to 5000 BC - according to Egyptologists - the Nile valley was
populated only by primitive neolithic hunter-gatherers whose ‘toolkits’
were limited to sharpened flintstones and pieces ofstick. IfSchoch is right,
therefore, then it follows that the Sphinx and its neighbouring temples
(which are built out of hundreds of200-ton hmestone blocks) must be the
work of an as yet unidentified advanced civihzation of antiquity.
The Egyptological reaction.?
That’s ridiculous’, scoffed Peter Lecovara, assistant curator of the
Egyptian Department in Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts. ‘Thousands of
scholars working for hundreds of years have studied this problem and the
chronology is pretty much worked out. There are no big surprises in store for us . . .’
Other ‘experts’ were equally dismissive. According to Carol Redmont,
for example, an archaeologist at the University of California’s Berkeley
campus: ‘There is no way this could be true. The people of that region
would not have had the technology, the governing institutions or even the
will to build such a structure thousands of years before Khafre’s reign.’ ^
And the redoubtable Zahi Hawass, who had tried to nip the geological
research in the bud in the first place, had this to say about the
Schoch—West team and their unorthodox conclusions concerning the antiquity of the Sphinx:
American hallucinations! West is an amateur. There is absolutely no scientific
base for any of this. We have older monuments in the same area. They
definitely weren’t built by men from space or Atlantis. It’s nonsense and we
won’t allow our monuments to be exploited for personal enrichment. The Sphinx is the soul of Egypt’.^
John West was not in the least bit surprised by the rhetoric. In his long and
lonely quest to mount a proper investigation into the age of the
anonymous Sphinx many such brickbats had been thrown at him before.
This time, with Schoch’s heavyweight support - and the massive
exposure ofthe whole matter on NBC television - he felt vindicated at last.
Furthermore it was clear that the Egyptologists were rattled by the
intrusion of an empirical science like geology into their normally cosy and
exclusive academic territory.
West, however, wanted to take the matter a good deal further than



The Riddle of the Sphinx 21
Schoch was prepared to go and felt that the geologist had been too
conservative and lenient in his ‘minimum’ estimate of 7000 to 5000 bc for
the age of the Sphinx: ‘Here Schoch and I disagree, or rather interpret the
same data somewhat differently. Schoch very deliberately takes the most
conservative view allowed by the data . . . However I remain convinced
that the Sphinx must predate the break-up of the last Ice Age . .
In practice this means any time before 15,000 BC - a hunch that West
says is based on the complete lack ofevidence ofa high culture in Egypt in
7000 to 5000 BC. ‘If the Sphinx was as recent as 7000-5000 bc,’ he argues,
‘I think we probably would have other Egyptian evidence of the
civilization that carved it.’ Since there is no such evidence. West reasons
that the civilization responsible for the Sphinx and its neighbouring
temples must have disappeared long before 7000-5000 bc: ‘The missing
other evidence is, perhaps, buried deeper than anyone has looked and/or
in places no one has yet explored — along the banks of the ancient Nile
perhaps, which is miles from the present Nile, or even at the bottom of the
Mediterranean, which was dry during the last Ice Age . . .’ ^^
Despite their ‘friendly disagreement’ as to whether the erosion of the
Sphinx indicated a date of7000 to 5000 bc, or a much more remote period,
Schoch and West decided to present an abstract oftheir research at Giza to
the Geological Society of America. They were encouraged by the
response. Several hundred geologists agreed with the logic of their
contentions and dozens offered practical help and advice to further the
investigation.”
Even more refreshing was the reaction from the international media.
After the GSA meeting articles appeared in dozens ofnewspapers, and the
issue of the Sphinx’s age was widely covered by television and radio. ‘We
were over the fifty-yard line and heading downfield,’ recalls West.”
As for the matter of his difference of opinion with Schoch about the
dating of the monument, he honestly concedes that ‘only further research
will resolve the question’.”
Jury still out
Since 1993 the Egyptian government, on the advice of Western
Egyptologists, has not permitted any further geological research or
seismic investigations to be undertaken around the Sphinx. This is



22 Enigmas
surprising in view of the momentous implications of Schoch’s findings
and all the more surprising because his original evidence has not yet been
convincingly challenged in any forum. On the contrary, as the years have
gone by, the Boston geologist has withstood the rigours of scientific peer
review, several times successfully defending his contention that the
distinctive weathering visible on the Sphinx, and on the walls of its
enclosure — a combination ofdeep vertical fissures and rolling, undulating,
horizontal coves — is a classic, textbook example of what happens to a
limestone structure when you have rain beating down on it for thousands
of years . . . When set in the context of our knowledge of ancient
climates at Giza, he adds, this represents abundant evidence ‘that the
Great Sphinx predates its traditional attribution of circa 2500 BC . . . I’m
just following the science where it leads me, and it leads me to conclude
that the Sphinx was built much earlier than previously thought.’ ^
Of course it cannot be said that Robert Schoch has proved that the
monument dates back to the epoch of7000 to 5000 BC. Nor has John West
proved the even earlier date that he favours. But then again neither has
orthodox Egyptologythat the Sphinx belongs to Khafre and to the epoch of 2500 BC.
In other words, by any rational and reasonable criteria, the jury is still
out on the true attribution and antiquity ofthis extraordinary monument.
The riddle of the Sphinx is stiU unsolved. And as we see in the next
chapter, it is a riddle that encompasses the entire Giza necropohs.



Chapter 3
Mystery Piled upon Mystery
‘It is said that the stone [used in the
construction of the Pyramids of Giza] was
conveyed over a great distance . . . and that
the construction was effected by means of
mounds ... The most remarkable thing is
that, though the constructions were on such
a great scale and the country round about
them consists of nothing but sand, not a
trace remains either of any mound or of the
dressing of the stones, so that they do not
have the appearance of being the slow
handiwork of men but look hke a sudden
creation, as though they had been made by
some god and set down bodily in the
surrounding sand.’
Diodorus Siculus, Book /, first century BC
The Giza necropolis, site of the Great Sphinx and the three great
Pyramids of Egypt, is, by any standards, an extraordinary architectural
and archaeological puzzle. This is not only because of the many
remarkable physical and engineering characteristies of the principal
Pyramids and temples, but also because all of these monuments are
essentially uninscribed and anonymous. Like the Sphinx, therefore, they
are difficult to date by objective means. Like the Sphinx, too, their
attribution to specific Pharaohs by Egyptologists is necessarily based upon
a somewhat arbitrary interpretation of contextual clues.
The three great Pyramids, for example, are conventionally assigned as
the tombs ofKhufu, Khafre and Menkaure- three Pharaohs ofthe Fourth
Dynasty. Yet no Pharaoh’s body has ever been found in any of these
monuments and while there are some so-called ‘quarry marks’ - crudely
daubed graffiti - in cavities above the roof of the ‘King’s Chamber’ in the
Great Pyramid, these writings, as we shall see in Part II, are not



24 Enigmas
2. Overhead view of the principal monuments of the Giza necropolis.



Mystery Piled upon Mystery 25
particularly helpful in confirming the orthodox identification with Khufu.
There are no other texts of any kind in the Great Pyramid, or in the
Pyramids attributed to Khafre and Menkaure. The three small ‘satellite’
Pyramids lined up along the eastern face of the Great Pyramid, and the
three other satellite Pyramids lying near the south-western edge ofthe site,
are similarly bereft of inscriptions. Some Fourth Dynasty artefacts were
found inside these six ‘satellite’ structures but there is no guarantee that
these artefacts are contemporary with the monuments.
The same problem applies to the statues of Khafre and Menkaure that
were found in the latter’s ‘Mortuary’ Temple and the former’s ‘Valley’
Temple. These statues are the only evidence supporting the attribution of
these otherwise anonymous and uninscribed edifices to the two Pharaohs
in question. In all logic, however, they only suggest that attribution. They
certainly do not confirm it. Khafre and Menkaure, in other words, might
have built the temples. But it is also possible that they took over pre¬
existing structures which they had inherited from an earlier time, and that
they adapted, renovated and furnished these structures with their own
statues in order to suit their own purposes. After all, we do not attribute
the building of London’s Trafalgar Square to Nelson just because his
statue stands there. By the same token Egyptologists could be going too far
when they attribute the building of the Valley Temple to Khafre on the
basis of his statue found there.
Indeed, this is an observation that is true for the Giza necropolis as a
whole. The undoubted connection that it has with the Fourth Dynasty is
not in dispute, but the precise nature ofthis connection remains unproven.
To be sure, there are huge quantities of unmistakable and heavily
inscribed Fourth Dynasty mastaba tombs lying east and west of the Great
Pyramid and west of the Sphinx, but the contention that the Pyramids
themselves are ‘tombs and tombs only’ is guesswork. It could be the case,
as has happened elsewhere in the world, that an ancient and sacred site
designed and built for one purpose was subsequently taken over and re¬
used for another rather different purpose. We might imagine, for example,
that the Pyramids and the other principal monuments surrounding them
were originally intended to fulfil purely ritual, ceremonial and religious
functions and that the practice of burying the dead there - principally
Fourth Dynasty queens and nobles judging by the identifiable remains
that have survived - was a later adaptation effected by people who were



26 Enigmas
unconnected to the genesis of the site but who sought to b6 interred in a
place that was imbued with ancient prestige and sanctity. A Western
analogy is the practice of burying the remains of particularly favoured
individuals under the flagstones of medieval cathedrals — a practice that
continues to this day, but that does* not lead us to conclude that these
cathedrals are tombs or even that they were built primarily for the purposes of burial.
Impossible engineering
Approaching Giza from the east, through the modem Arab village of
Nazlet-el-Sammam, one comes first to the Great Sphinx - which rears its
grizzled head above an ugly bus-park and a crowd of tourist shops and
cafes. Fortunately the ground has been cleared for a distance of about two
hundred metres in front of the monument, giving an open view of the
enormous and unusual architectural complex that has surrounded it since time immemorial.
This complex consists ofthe so-called ‘Sphinx Temple’ and the ‘Valley
Temple of Khafre’, the former lying immediately to the east of the
Sphinx, and directly overlooked by it, the latter lying a little to the south of
the Sphinx Temple, separated from it by a narrow corridor but in direct
alignment - a bit like two chunky, detached houses standing side by side.
The layout of these monuments, and the relationship that both of them
have to the Sphinx and its enclosure, are best appreciated from the plans
and photographs reproduced herewith. The Valley Temple is the larger of
the two, being almost square and measuring approximately 130 feet along
each side; the Sphinx Temple is more pronouncedly rhomboidal with side lengths of about 100 feet.
Originally around 40 feet high, both monuments are built out of
massive limestone core-blocks and both were at one time fitted with inner
and outer casings of granite. These casings and much of the core masonry
have been removed from the Sphinx Temple, leaving it in a very
dilapidated state. By contrast the Valley Temple is still largely intact. Both
monuments are roofless, lacking their original ceiling beams. In the case of
the Valley Temple, however, sixteen original interior columns and
architraves remain in place in the T-shaped central hall, creating graceful patterns of fight and shadow.

the stark, undecorated austerity of the building style," and the use
throughout of ponderous megaliths - many of which are estimated to
weigh in the range of200 tons apiece.' There are no ima//blocks here at all:
every single piece of stone is enormous - the least of them weighing more
than 50 tons — and it is difficult to understand how such monsters could
have been lifted and manoeuvred into place by the ancient Egyptians.
Indeed, even today, contractors using the latest construction technology
would face formidable challenges if they were commissioned to produce
exact replicas of the Sphinx Temple and the Valley Temple.
The problems are manifold but stem mainly from the extremely large
size of the blocks — which can be envisaged in terms of their dimensions
and weight as a series of diesel locomotive engines stacked one on top of
the other. Such loads simply cannot be hoisted by the typical tower and
hydraulic cranes that we are familiar with from building sites in our cities.
These cranes, which are pieces of advanced technology, can generally
pick a maximum load of20 tons at what is called ‘minimum span’ — i.e. at
the closest distance to the tower along the ‘boom’ or ‘arm’ of the crane.
The longer the span the smaller the load and at ‘maximum span’ the limit is around 5 tons.
Loads exceeding 50 tons require special cranes. Furthermore, there are
few cranes in the world today that would be capable of picking 200-ton
blocks of quarried limestone. Such cranes would normally have to be of
the bridge’ or ‘gantry’ type, often seen in factories and at major industrial
ports where they are used to move large pieces of equipment and
machinery such as bulldozers, military tanks, or steel shipping containers.
Built with structural steel members and powered with massive electric
motors, the majority ofthese cranes have a load limit ofunder 100 tons. In
short, a commission to put together a temple out of 200-ton blocks would
be a most unusual and very taxing job, even for modem heavy-load and crane specialists.
In the United States there are presently only two land-based cranes of
the ‘counterweight and boom’ type able to handle loads in the 200-ton
range. Recently one was brought in to a Long Island construction site to
lift a 2oo-ton boiler into a factory. The crane has a boom 220 feet long (at
one end of which is i6o-ton concrete counterweight which keeps it from
tipping over). A crew of 20 men had to work for six weeks to prepare the
ground before the boiler could be lifted.^



Mystery Piled upon Mystery 29
The biggest technical challenge of building a replica of the Valley
Temple would be the need to lift hundreds of such weights and to do so
within the physical limitations of the Giza site. In order to overcome that
challenge the ideal crane would have to be of the gantry or bridge type,
made mobile by being mounted on steel tracks — which would have to be set
up within, or around, the confined area of the temple structure itself
Not surprisingly, when the crane engineer responsible for lifting the
200-ton boiler on Long Island was shown photographs and given technical
details concerning the blocks ofthe Valley Temple - and asked whether he
thought that he could hoist similar blocks into place with his crane - he
replied:
I’m looking at what you’re showing me here, and looking at the distances
involved. I don’t know ifwe would be able to pick the 200-ton blocks from the
positions that I see available to us . . . In my business we pick heavy loads, and
we look to see how heavy loads were picked by other people before us. And
seeing how they moved these heavy blocks, 200-ton blocks, thousands and
thousands ofyears ago, I have no idea how they did this job. It’s a mystery and
it’ll probably always be a mystery to me, and maybe to everybody.^
How, why, when?
Mystery or not, the Valley Temple and the Sphinx Temple stand at Giza
as mute testimony to the fact that certain builders in antiquity did know
how to pick 200-ton loads, and did have the technical wherewithal to do
the job. Furthermore, although it is reasonably certain that they did not do
it with gantry or any other such cranes, we are in darkness as to how they
did do it. Confronted by such questions Egyptologists tend to speak in
vague and general terms of ‘earth ramps’ and ‘unlimited manpower’.'^
Engineers, however are required to be more specific and to address
themselves to the issues ofthe precise kinds oframps that would have been
required - up which such big blocks could have been dragged - and the
precise numbers of men that would have been needed to drag them.
No detailed technical studies have ever been undertaken at Giza
concerning the logistics of building the Sphinx and Valley Temples. The
Pyramids, however - which Egyptologists also believe were built with
ramps - have been studied quite closely by a number of highly qualified
architects and engineers.^ What these studies have indicated is that the
maximum feasible gradient for a construction ramp up which heavy loads



30 Enigmas
could be hauled by men on foot is i in 10/ In the case of the Great
Pyramid, which originally reached a height of 481 feet, this would have
called for a ramp 4800 feet long and almost three times as massive as the
Pyramid itself^
Of course, such a problem does not apply where the Sphinx Temple
and the Valley Temple are concerned because their original constructed
height was much lower than that of the Pyramids and they therefore could
have been approached by relatively short i-in-io ramps. The fearsome
mass and weight of the many 200-ton blocks found in these temples,
however, rules out the use of any ramp made of materials less stable than
the hmestone ashlars of the temples themselves.*
Let us assume, then, that solid stone ramps were used and then later
dismantled and cleared away. The question now becomes: how many men
would be required to haul hundreds of 200-ton blocks up such ramps.? To
get this problem into perspective it is helpful to realize that a block of 200
tons represents a load roughly equivalent to 300 family-sized automobiles
(each with an average weight of three-quarters of a ton).
Again, we do not have a technical study on the Sphinx and Valley
Temples to refer to. Fortunately, however, a relevant study has been
undertaken at the Great Pyramid where the French master engineer Jean
Leherou Kerisel, a consultant for the building ofthe Cairo Metro, worked
out the logistics of hauling into place the 70-ton blocks that were used in
the construction of the so-called King’s Chamber. According to his
calculations the job could just about have been done — although with
enormous difficulty - with teams of 600 men arranged in ranks across a
very wide ramp buttressed against one face of the Pyramid.’ From this it
follows that teams 1800 men strong would have been required to haul the
Valley Temple blocks. But could 1800 men have been effectively
harnessed to such dense and relatively compact loads (the maximum
dimensions ofeach block are 30 feet by 10 feet by 12 feet).? And more to the'
point, since the temple walls do not exceed 130 feet along each side, how
likely is it that such large teams could have been organized to work
efficiently - or at all - in the limited space available.? Assuming a minimum
of three feet of horizontal space per man, each rank of haulers could not
have contained more than fifty men. To make up the total of 1800 men
needed to move a 200-ton block, therefore, would have called for no less



Mystery Piled upon Mystery 31
than thirty-six ranks of men pulling in unison, to be harnessed to each
block.
The potential complications that might have arisen are mind-boggling.
Even assuming they could all have been overcome, however, the next
question that presents itself is perhaps the most intriguing of all.
Why?
Why bother?
Why specify temples built out of unwieldy 200-ton blocks when it
would have been much easier, much more feasible and just as aesthetically
pleasing, to use smaller blocks of say two or three tons each?
There are really only two answers. Either the people who designed
these hulking edifices had knowledge of some technique that made it easy
for them to quarry, manipulate and position enormous pieces of stone, or
their way of thinking was utterly different from our own — in which case
their motives and priorities are unlikely to be fathomable in terms of
normal cross-cultural comparisons.
We also need to ask when the work was done.
As noted earher, the Sphinx Temple and the Valley Temple are both
anonymous monuments. And although it is certain that use was made of
the latter for Khafre’s funerary rituals, there is no proofthat he built it. On
the contrary, if Professor Robert Schoch’s geological evidence is correct,
then it is quite certain that Khafre did not build either of these structures.
This is so because the Sphinx itselfwas made by hewing a deep horseshoe¬
shaped trench out of the bedrock ofthe Giza plateau, leaving a central core
which was then carved into shape, and because geologists have been able to
prove that the limestone megaliths used in both temples came from the
trench and were thus quarried at the same time as the Sphinx.^® It therefore
follows, if the Sphinx is indeed thousands of years older than Egyptolo¬
gists think it is, that the temples must also be thousands of years older.
What we may be looking at here are the fingerprints of highly
sophisticated and perhaps even technological people capable of awe¬
inspiring architectural and engineering feats at a time when no civilization
of any kind is supposed to have existed anywhere on earth.
Supportive ofthis possibility is the fact that the megaliths ofthe temples
demonstrate precisely the same apparent precipitation-induced weather¬
ing features as the Sphinx itself And it is of interest to note that the
surviving granite casing blocks seem to have been carved on their inner



32 Enigmas
faces to fit over the limestone core-blocks at a time when these were already
heavily marked by erosion. Since the granite casing has the look ofother Old
Kingdom Egyptian architecture (while the limestone core-blocks do not)
this may be taken as further evidence ofthe theory that an ancient, revered
and much-eroded structure was restored and renovated by the Old
Kingdom Pharaohs. Robert Schoch certainly favours this view. ‘I remain
convinced,’ comments the Boston University geology professor, ‘that the
backs of the Old Kingdom granite facing stones were carved to match or
complement the earlier weathering features seen on the surfaces of the
core hmestone blocks of the temples.’"
Memorials mighty
The famous black diorite statue of Khafre that now stands in the Cairo
Museum was found upside down in a twenty-foot deep pit in the floor of
the antechamber that leads into the Valley Temple’s T-shaped central
hall. Walking through this hall, hemmed in by immensely strong and thick
limestone and granite walls, the visitor will eventually come to a high,
narrow passageway on the north-western side of the structure. This
passage leads out of the rear of the temple, along the southern side of the
Sphinx trench — where it overlooks the Sphinx — and thence joins with the
massive ‘causeway’ that runs for more than looo feet up the slope of the
Giza plateau linking the Valley Temple to the Mortuary Temple and
thence to the eastern face of the second Pyramid.
The causeways - one for each of the three Pyramids - are important
features of the Giza necropolis, though all have faUen into an advanced
state ofdisrepair. Some 20 feet wide, and varying in length from quarter of
a mile up to halfa mile, they each originally linked a Mortuary Temple to a
Valley Temple. Today, however, the only relatively intact complex is that
attributed to Khafre described above. In the case ofthe third Pyramid, the
Valley Temple is now completely gone but the megalithic ruins of the
Mortuary Temple are still in place. In the case of the Great Pyramid the
only remaining part of the Mortuary Temple is its basalt floor, while the
rums ofthe Valley Temple - ifany survive - are buried under the village of

fashioned out of huge blocks of limestone. Indeed all of these prodigious
structures are clearly ‘of a piece’ from a design point of view and seem to
have been the work of builders who thought like gods or giants. There is
about them an overwhelming, weary, aching sense of antiquity and it is
certainly not hard to imagine that they might be the leavings of a lost
civilization. In this regard we are reminded of The Sacred Sermon^ a
‘Hermetic’ text of Egyptian origin that speaks with awe of lordly men
‘devoted to the growth ofwisdom’ who lived ‘before the Flood’ and whose
civilization was destroyed: ‘And there shall be memorials mighty of their
handiworks upon the earth, leaving dim trace behind when cycles are renewed . .
There is another feature of the causeways, of intense interest to us,
which we shall explore in detail in Parts III and IV - their orientation. The
causeway of the Third Pyramid, like the gaze of the Sphinx, is targeted
due east. The causeway of the second Pyramid points 14 degrees south of
due east. The causeway of the Great Pyramid points 14 degrees north of
due east. The arrangement is precise, geometrical, obviously deliberate,
with each significant structure bearing a designed relationship to every
other structure — and the whole contained within a large, circular artificial
‘horizon’ that is apparently centred on the apex of the second Pyramid
with its rim lying just to the west of the rump of the Sphinx.
Orthodox Egyptological opinion concerning the causeways is that they
were ceremonial roads. Notwithstanding the fact that they are technologi¬
cal masterpieces which could only have been built with an enormous
expense of ingenuity and effort at the direction of skilled surveyors and
architects, the assumption is that they were usedjust once for the funerary
journey of the Pharaoh’s corpse from Valley Temple to Mortuary Temple
where his final embalming rituals took place.
Perhaps so. As we shall show in Parts III and IV, however, there are
features of these causeways which suggest that they may have been used
many times by many different Pharaohs and that they have their technical
and symbolic origins in events that occurred long before the dawn of the
historical civilization of Egypt.

Not purely symbolic boats
In the 1850s Sir Richard Francis Burton, the British explorer and
adventurer, visited Egypt and the Pyramids of Giza. He noted some odd
‘rhomboidal depressions’ lying parallel to the eastern side of the Great
Pyramid, close to the end of its causeway, and made sketches of them
which are now kept in the British Museum. Some years later, in 1881, Sir
William Flinders Petrie, the ‘Father ofBritish Egyptology’, also saw these
strange depressions but simply referred to them as ‘trenches’ and did not
bother to have them cleared.
In 1893, buried in pits near a relatively obscure pyramid on another site,
the famous French Egyptologist de Morgan discovered six large wooden
boats, but little was made of this. In 1901 another French Egyptologist,
Chassinat, discovered a ‘rhomboidal pit’ near the pyramid of Djedefra at
Abu Roash. After noting that it very much resembled the pits at Giza near
the Great Pyramid, he wrote: ‘their purpose is unknown, as is the case
here.’"
Ancient Egyptian funerary texts are strewn with references to boats
notably the various solar and divine vessels on which the deceased hoped
to voyage in the cosmic afterlife (the ‘boat ofmillions ofyears’ for example,
the ‘bark of Osiris’, and the ‘bark of Ra’). Carvings, drawings and
paintings of such ‘boats’ and ‘barks’, with their characteristic high prows
and stems, adorn the walls of many an ancient tomb in Egypt and their
symbolic and religious functions were understood well before the close of
the nineteenth century. Nevertheless it was only when the German
archaeologist Ludwig Borchardt excavated an obvious and unmistakable
boat made of bricks near the sun-temple and pyramids at Abusir, that it
was recognized that the mysterious ‘rhomboidal pits’ were in fact boats
or at any rate representations of boats, or graves for boats.
Since Borchardt’s time, several other boat pits have been found - by
Selim Hassan in 1933, for example, and by Walter Emery in 1937. Finally,
in 1954, Kamal el-Mallakh discovered something quite breathtaking - a
partially disassembled cedarwood boat, more than 143 feet long, buried in
a pit on the south side of the Great Pyramid. Much more recently another
vessel of similar dimensions has been located in an adjacent pit. As yet
unexcavated, it is apparently to be studied by a Japanese consortium.
The fact that Egyptologists took a long time to notice that there were



36 Enigmas
large boats buried at Giza does not necessarily mean that their analysis of
the function of these boats is completely wrong. The idea is that the
majestic vessels were intended in some ‘primitive’, ‘magical’, ‘supersti¬
tious’, ‘half-savage’ way to serve as symbolic vehicles on which the souls of
dead Pharaohs could sail into Heaven. This interpretation is consistent
with the ancient Egyptian funerary texts and there can be little doubt that
the boats — ‘solar boats’ as the Egyptologists call them — were indeed
intended to play a part in symbolic celestial journeys. As we shall see in
Parts III and IV, however, it is possible that the precise nature and purpose
of those journeys may have been much more complex and significant than
has hitherto been recognized.
Meanwhile, standing in front of the ‘solar boat’ excavated from beside
the south face ofthe Great Pyramid in 1954 it is hard not to note the marks
of wear and tear on the keel and gangplank and the numerous other clear
signs that this elegant cedarwood vessel, with its high curving prow and
stem, was sailed many times on water.**
If it was purely symbolic, why was it used.?
And why was it necessary to have such an elaborate and technically
accomplished'^ craft for symbolic purposes? Wouldn’t a symbohc vessel
such as the brick boats and boat ‘graves’ found at other Pyramids - have done just as well?
The Pyramids
The dominant features ofthe Giza necropolis are, ofcourse, its three great
Pyramids - those conventionally attributed to Khufu, Khafre and
j Menkaure. In a sense they are what the entire, vast enterprise proclaims
itself to be all about, what the causeways lead towards, what the ‘solar
boats are buried beside. Sprawhng diagonally across the meridian axis of
the site, it is they, above all else, that the geometrical ‘Horizon of Giza’
appears to have been designed to circumscribe. Nothing about them is
accidental: their original constructed heights, their angles of slope, the
measurement of their perimeters, even the pattern in which they are
carefully laid out on the ground - all of these things are purposive and laden with meaning.
Because we have described the Pyramids in such detail in other
publications'* - where we have also looked in depth into many of their



Mystery Piled upon Mystery 37
technical and engineering puzzles - we will not trouble the reader with
superfluous details here. Some basic statistics and a few points of analysis
are, however, unavoidable at this stage.
The Great Pyramid was originally 481.3949 feet in height (now
reduced to just a little over 450 feet) and its four sides each measure some
755 feet in length at the base. The second Pyramid was originally sUghtly
lower — with a designed height of 471 feet — and has sides measuring just
under 708 feet in length. The third Pyramid stands some 215 feet tall and
has a side length at the base of 356 feet.
When they were built the second Pyramid and the Great Pyramid were
both entirely covered in hmestone facing blocks, several courses of which
still adhere to the upper levels of the former. The Great Pyramid, by
contrast, is today almost completely bereft of its casing. We know from
historical accounts, however, that it was once clad from bottom to top with
smoothly-polished Tura hmestone which was shaken loose by a powerful
earthquake that devastated the Cairo area in ad 1301. The newly exposed
core masonry was then used for some years as a crude local quarry to
rebuild the shattered mosques and palaces of Cairo.
All the Arab commentators prior to the fourteenth century tell us that
the Great Pyramid’s casing was a marvel of architecture that caused the
edifice to glow brilhantly under the Egyptian sun. It consisted of an
estimated 22 acres of8-foot-thick blocks, each weighing in the region of 16
tons, ‘so subtilly jointed that one would have said that it was a single slab
from top to bottom’.*’ A few surviving sections can still be seen today at the
base of the monument. When they were studied in 1881 by Sir W. M.
Flinders Petrie, he noted with astonishment that ‘the mean thickness of
the joints is 0.020 of an inch; and, therefore, the mean variation of the
cutting of the stone from a straight line and from a true square is but 0.01
ofan inch on a length of75 inches up the face, an amount ofaccuracy equal
to the most modem opticians’ straight-edges of such a length.’
Another detail that Petrie found very difficult to explain was that the
blocks had been carefully and precisely cemented together: ‘To merely
place such stones in exact contact at the sides would be careful work, but to
do so with cement in the joint seems almost impossible . . .’ ^**
Also ‘almost impossible’, since the mathematical value pi (3.14) is not
supposed to have been calculated by any civilization until the Greeks
stumbled upon it in the third century BC,^* is the fact the designed height of



38 Enigmas
the Great Pyramid - 481.3949 feet - bears the same relatioriship to its base
perimeter (3023.16 feet) as does the circumference ofany circle to its radius.
This relationship is 2 pi (i.e. 481.3949 feet x 2 x 3.14 = 3023.16 feet).
Equally ‘impossible’ — at any rate for a people like the ancient Egyptians
who are supposed to have known nothing about the true shape and size of
our planet - is the relationship, in a scale of 1:43,200, that exists between
the dimensions of the Pyramid and the dimensions of the earth. Setting
aside for the moment the question of whether we are dealing with
coincidence here, it is a simple fact, verifiable on any pocket calculator,
that if you take the monument’s original height (481.3949 feet) and
multiply it by 43,200 you get a quotient of 3938.685 miles. This is an
underestimate by just 11 miles of the true figure for the polar radius of the
earth (3949 miles) worked out by the best modem methods. Likewise, if
you take the monument’s perimeter at the base (3023.16 feet) and multiply
this figure by 43,200 then you get 24,734.94 miles - a result that is within
170 miles of the true equatorial circumference of the earth (24,902 miles).
Moreover, although 170 miles sounds quite a lot, it amounts, in relation to
the earth’s total circumference, to a minus-error ofonly three quarters ofa single*per cent.
High precision
Such fine errors are within the general margins of tolerance found at the
Great Pyramid. Indeed, although it has a footprint of over 13 acres, and
consists ofsome six and a halfmillion tons oflimestone and granite blocks,
the sheer mass and size of this monster of monuments are not its most
impressive characteristics. More astounding by far is the incredible high
tech precision that is built into every aspect of its design.
Before going into the details, let us consider the implications ofvery fine
precision in very large monuments.
An analogy with the simple wrist-watch helps. If you are after an
accuracy of, say, a few seconds per week, then an ordinary quartz watch
costing fifty dollars or less will do the trick. If you want accuracy to within
a fraction of a second per year, however, then the quartz watch will no
longer serve and you will have to turn to something of the order of an atomic clock.
A similar situation applies in the construction industry. If you are



Mystery Piled upon Mystery 39
building a brick wall that is to appear straight within plus or minus i
degree per too metres and the whole roughly directed due north, then any
good bricklayer should be able to meet your specification. However, if
your requirement is for a wall that is straight within i arc minute per 100
metres and directed exactly due north, then you are going to need a laser
theodolite, an ordnance survey map accurate to 10 metres, and a highly
qualified team of professionals including an expert setting-out engineer,
an astronomer, a surveyor, several master-masons and a week or so to
ensure that the precision you are aiming for has in fact been achieved.
Such ‘atomic clock’ precision was achieved by the builders of the Great
Pyramid more than 4500 years ago. This is not a matter of historical
speculation, or of theory, but of plain, measurable facts.
For example the earth’s equatorial circumference of24,902 miles works
out at around 132 milhon feet, with the result that a degree of latitude at
the equator is equivalent to approximately 366,600 feet (i.e. 132 million
feet divided by 360 degrees). Each degree is divided into 60 arc minutes,
which means that i arc minute represents just over 6100 feet on the earth’s
surface, and each arc minute is then further subdivided into 60 arc seconds
— with the result that i arc second is equivalent to a distance of about loi
feet. This system ofmeasuring by degrees is not a modem convention but
rather an inheritance of scientific thinking, connected to ‘base 60’
5. Geodetic location of the Great Pyramid of Giza on latitude 30 degrees north (one third of
the way between the equator and the north pole) and at the centre of the world’s habitable
landmasses.



40 Enigmas
mathematics, that dates back to the remotest antiquity.^^ Nobody knows
where, or when, it originated.^^ It seems, however, to have been employed
in the geodetic and astronomical calculations that were used to locate the
Great Pyramid - for the monument is positioned barely a mile to the south
of latitude 30, i.e. almost exactly one third of the way between the equator
and the north pole.^'^
It is unlikely that this choice of location could have come about by
chance. Moreover, because no suitable site for such a massive structure
exists a mile or so to the north, it would be inadvisable to assume that the
fractional offset from the thirtieth parallel could have been caused by a
surveying error on the part of the Pyramid builders.
This offset amounts to i arc minute and 9 arc seconds - since the
Pyramid’s true latitude is 29 degrees 58' 51". Interestingly, however, as a
former Astronomer Royal of Scotland has observed:
‘If the original designer had wished that men should see with their bodily,
rather than their mental eyes, the pole of the sky from the foot of the Great
Pyramid, at an altitude before them of 30 degrees, he would have had to take
account of the refraction of the atmosphere; and that would have necessitated
the building standing not at latitude 30 degrees, but at latitude 29 degrees 58'
22'.“
In other words the monument turns out to be situated less than half an arc
minute to the north of astronomical latitude 30 degrees, uncorrected for
atmospheric refraction. Any ‘error’ involved is thus reduced to less than
half of one-sixtieth of one degree - a hair’s breadth in terms of the earth’s
circumference as a whole.
The same obsessive concern with accuracy is found in the orderly
evenness of the Pyramid’s base:
Length of West side:
Length of North side:
Length of East side:
Length of South side:
755 feet 9.1551 inches
755 feet 4.9818 inches
755 feet 10.4937 inches
756 feet 0.9739 inches^
The variation between the longest and shortest sides is therefore less than
8 inches - about one tenth of i per cent - quite an amazing feat when we
consider that we are measuring a distance of over 9000 inches carpeted
with thousands of huge limestone blocks weighing several tons each.



Mystery Piled upon Mystery 41
There is no sign that the ancient Pyramid builders were in any way
daunted by the task of maintaining such fastidious standards of symmetry
on such a grand scale. On the contrary, as though willingly seeking out
additional technical challenges, they went on to equip the monument with
comers set at almost perfect right-angles. The variation from 90 degrees is
just o degrees 00' 02^ at the north-west comer, o degrees 03' 02^ at the
north-east comer, o degrees 03' 33"' at the south-east comer, and o degrees
00' 33" at the south-west corner.^’
This, it must be conceded, is not just ‘atomic clock’ accuracy but the
Rolex, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Rolls-Royce and IBM of building
engineering all rolled into one.
And there is more.
It is fairly well known that the Pyramid was aligned by its architects to
the cardinal points (with its north face directed north, its east face directed
east, etc., etc.). Less well known is just how eerily exact is precision of
these alignments — with the average deviation from tme being only a little
over 3 arc minutes (i.e. about 5 per cent of a single degree).^
Why such meticulousness.?
Why such rigour.?
Why should even the most megalomaniacal of Pharaohs have cared
whether his massive ‘tomb’ was aligned within 3 arc minutes of tme north
— or indeed within a whole degree of true north.? To the naked-eye
observer it is virtually impossible to determine such a deviation. Indeed
most of us could not spot a misahgnment within 3 whole degrees (180 arc
minutes), let alone within 3 arc minutes (and some people have trouble
telling the general direction of north at all). So the question has to be
asked: what was all this incredible precision for.? Why did the builders
burden themselves with so much extra work and difficulty when the
effects of their additional labours would not be visible to the naked eye
anyway.?
They must, one assumes, have had a powerful motive to create what is
truly a miracle of the surveyor’s art.
And what makes this miracle all the more remarkable is the fact that it
was not performed on a perfectly flat area of ground, as one might expect,
but with a massive natural mound, or hill, left exactly in the middle of the
site on which the Great Pyramid was being erected. Estimated to be almost
30 feet high - as tall as a two-storey house - and positioned dead centre

over the base area (of which it occupies approximately 70 per cent), this
primeval mound was skilfully incorporated into the lower courses of the
growing edifice. No doubt its presence has contributed down the epochs to
the structure’s legendary stability. It is extremely difficult, however, to
understand how the ancient surveyors were able to square the base of the
Pyramid in its early and most important stages with the mound so solidly
in the way (squaring the base normally involves taking repeated diagonal
measurements across the comers).^’ All that we can say for sure is that the
base is square and that the monument is locked into the cardinal axes ofour
planet with great care and precision.
Chambers and passageways
The second and third Pyramids have relatively simple internal chambers
and passageway systems - the former having one principal chamber just
below ground level, positioned centrally under the apex ofthe monument,
the latter having three main chambers, cut a little more deeply into the
bedrock but again positioned centrally under the apex of the monument.
The entrances to both Pyramids are in their north faces and take the form
of cramped passageways sloping downwards at an angle of 26 degrees,
before levelling off to join horizontal corridors under the monument.
The internal structure ofthe Great Pyramid, by contrast, is much more
complex, with an elaborate arrangement of passageways and galleries
sloping up and down again at 26 degrees - and with three principal
internal chambers. Of these latter only one, the ‘Subterranean Chamber’,
is below ground level. The other two - the so-called ‘Queen’s Chamber’
and ‘King’s Chamber’ - are both located in the heart of the monument’s
superstructure at substantial altitudes above the ground.
The layout of these internal features is best appreciated from the
diagram printed on page 45. Chief amongst them, surmounted only by
Davison’s Chamber (and above that by the four so-called ‘relieving
chambers’ which contain the ‘quarry marks’ mentioned earlier) is the
rectangular red-granite room, now famous as the ‘King’s Chamber’. It
proved to be completely devoid of either treasures or inscriptions, or the
body of a king, when it was first entered by Calif A1 Mamoun in the ninth
century ad. Measuring 34 feet 4 inches in length, 17 feet 2 inches in width,
and 19 feet i inch in height it is located about 150 feet vertically above the

base of the Pyramid. Its many mysteries are too weU known to require
further elucidation here (and, besides, have been described in some detail in our earlier publications^®).
Connecting the King’s Chamber to the lower levels ofthe monument is
the Grand Gallery, one of‘the most celebrated architectural works which
have survived from the Old Kingdom’.^* Sloping downwards at an angle of
26 degrees, it is an astonishing corbel-vaulted hall fully 153 feet in length
and 7 feet in width at floor level. Its lofty ceiling, 28 feet above the visitor’s
head, is just visible in the electric lighting with which the Pyramid has
been equipped in modem times.
At the base of the Grand Gallery a horizontal passage, 3 feet 9 inches
high and 127 feet long, runs due south into the ‘Queen’s Chamber’. Again
found empty by Mamoun, this is a smaller room than the King’s
Chamber, measuring 18 feet 10 inches from east to west and 17 feet 2
inches from north to south. Reaching a height of 20 feet 5 inches, the
ceiling is gabled (whereas it is flat in the King’s Chamber) and there is a
large corbelled niche of unknown function just south of the centre line in the east wall.

9. Detail of the corridors, chambers and shafts of the Great Pyramid.
Returning along the horizontal passageway to its junction with the base
of the Grand Gallery the visitor will note, behind a modem iron grille, the
narrow and uninviting mouth of the ‘Well-Shaft’ - a near vertical tunnel,
often less than 3 feet in diameter, that eventually joins up with the
Descending Corridor, almost 100 feet below ground level. How the
tunnelers, encysted in solid rock, were able to home in so accurately on
their target remains a mystery. Mysterious, too, is the true function of all
these odd systems of interconnecting ‘ducts’ which lead busily hither and
thither inside the body of the monument, like the circuits of some great
machine.
Sloping downwards from the Grand Gallery, and extending it in the
direction of the ground at the continuing angle of 26 degrees, is another
corridor. Known (from the point ofview ofthose entering the Pyramid) as
the Ascending Corridor, it measures 3 feet 11 inches high by 3 feet 5 inches
wide and has a total length ofjust under 129 feet. Leaving the Pyramid, the
visitor is obhged to ape-walk uncomfortably down the Ascending
Corridor until the point where it joins up with ‘Mamoun’s Hole’ - the
tunnel that the Arabs cut for their forced entry in the ninth century - on
the western side of two hulking red-granite ‘plugging blocks’ which mask



46 Enigmas
the junction with the Descending Corridor. At the bottom of this 350
foot-long corridor, off limits to all but bona fide Egyptologists (and those
willing to bribe the increasingly hard-pressed and demoralized Inspectors
and ghafirs responsible for the day-to-day adminstration of Giza) is a truly
remarkable feature - the Subterranean Chamber that nestles in solid
bedrock more than 100 feet below the surface of the plateau (and almost
600 feet below the Pyramid’s lofty summit platform).
Inner space
The first thing that the interpid visitor should do, after gaining access to
the Descending Corridor, is to chmb up it a few feet in the direction of the
Pyramid’s true entrance. Now covered with an iron grille, this entrance is
located in the monument’s north face, nine courses above and 24 feet to
the east of ‘Mamoun’s Hole’ (through which all members of the public
enter the Pyramid today).
Here, at the point in the ceiling of the Descending Corridor where the
mouth of the Ascending Corridor was hewn upwards, it is possible to
inspect the bottom end ofthe lowermost ofthe two plugging blocks. It is as
firmly jammed in place today as it was when Mamoun’s diggers first
encountered it in the ninth century, and it is easy to understand why its
presence there encouraged them to tunnel round it into the softer
limestone, seeking a way past the obstacle and into the upper reaches of
whatever lay beyond.
Perhaps this was exactly what the Pyramid builders had ‘programmed’
those early explorers to do. After all, ifyou see that a huge chunk of granite
has been hauled into place to block what is obviously an upwards-sloping
corridor, then it is only human nature to try to get into that corridor
which Mamoun’s men did.
More than a thousand years later, tourists and archaeologists still follow
the trail that those pioneering Arabs blazed around the plugging blocks
into the main north-south axis of the Pyramid’s system of passageways.
And though there have been all manner of hackings and tunnellings in
search of further passageways (in the floors and walls of the King’s and
Queen’s Chambers, for example), the plugs at the base of the Ascending
Corridor have never subsequently been disturbed.
This is an understandable oversight if one is satisfied that the sole



Mystery Piled upon Mystery 47
function of these plugs was to block the Ascending Corridor in a north
south direction. Why, however, has no one ever tried to find out if
anything lies behind their eastern aspect.^^^ As well as having the same
height and width as the Ascending Corridor, thus filling it completely,
each of the plugs is about four feet in length — and thus easily long enough
to conceal the entrance to a second and completely separate passageway
system branching off at right angles towards the east.
There is certainly room for such a second system inside the Great
Pyramid — and for much else besides. Indeed it has been calculated that as
many as 3700 fully constructed chambers, each the size of the existing
King’s Chamber could be accommodated within the monument’s vast
‘inner space’ of 8.5 million cubic feet.^^
The stones of darkness and the shadow of death
Having examined the plugging blocks, the visitor is faced by a long climb
down the full 350-foot length of the Descending Corridor, initially
through masonry and thence into bedrock. As the journey proceeds, the
rays of sunlight penetrating the barred entrance to the north grow
progressively weaker and one has the sense of dropping like a deep-sea
diver into the dark depths of a midnight-black ocean.
The corridor, which every intuition proclaims to be a remotely ancient,
prehistoric feature, is 3 feet 11 inches high by 3 feet 6 inches wide and may
originally have been cut into the 30-foot-tall rocky mound that occupied
this site millennia before the Pyramid was built. It is unsettling, therefore,
to discover that it is machine-age straight from top to bottom. According
to Flinders Petrie, the variation along the whole passage ‘is under ‘4 inch in
the sides and ^ inch on the roof In addition there is one segment of the
corridor, 150 feet in length, where ‘the average error ofstraightness is only
one fiftieth of an inch, an amazingly minute amount.’^^
With hunched back, the visitor continues down this long, straight
corridor sloping due south into the bedrock of the Giza plateau at the now
familiar angle of 26 degrees. As ever greater depths are plumbed it is hard
not to grow increasingly conscious of the tremendous mass of hmestone
that is piled above and ofthe heavy, dusty, unfresh fug ofthe subterranean
air - like the exhalation of some cyclopean beast. Looking back
apprehensively towards the entrance, one notices that the penetrating

light has been reduced to a ghmmering star-burst, high up and far away.
And it is normal, at this point, to feel a concomitant glimmer of
apprehension, a shght tug of anxiety at the extent ofone’s separation from the world above.
On the west side of the corridor, quite near the bottom, is an alcove,
again covered by an iron grille, that gives access to the vertical Well-Shaft
and thence to the Grand Gallery and the upper chambers. Soon
afterwards the 26-degree descending slope levels off into a low horizontal
passageway, running 29 feet from north to south, through which the
visitor IS obliged to crawl on all fours. Near the end of this passageway,
again on the west side, is another alcove, 6 feet long and 3 feet deep that
has been roughly hewn out of the bedrock and that ends in a blind
unfinished wall. Then, after a further 4 feet of crawling, the horizontal
passageway opens at a height of about 2 feet above floor level into the Subterranean Chamber.



Mystery Piled upon Mystery 49
Were it not for a single low-wattage electric bulb installed in modem
times, the visitor would now be in complete darkness. The light that the
bulb casts has a greenish, sepulchral hue, and what it reveals is a most
peculiar room, considerably larger than the King’s Chamber, measuring
46 feet along its east-west axis, and 27 feet i inch from north to south, but
with a maximum height of just ii feet 6 inches.In the approximate
centre of the floor, on the east side, is a railing surrounding a square pit
reaching a depth of about 10 feet, and beyond that, penetrating the south
wall, is a second horizontal corridor, 2 feet 4 inches square, running due
south into the bedrock for a further 53 feet and terminating in a blank wall.
Looking to the right, one notes that the floor of the western side of the
Chamber rises up into a kind of chest-high platform. This has been
irregularly trenched, creating four parallel ‘fins’ of limestone running east
to west, almost touching the relatively flat roof at some points but with a
clearance of up to six feet in others.
All these strange features conspire to create an oppressive, claustropho¬
bic atmosphere in the room that reminds the visitor ofhow far beneath the
ground he has burrowed, and of how inescapably he could be entombed
here if there were to be any serious collapse of the millions of tons of
limestone above his head.
Very interesting developments
Egyptological opinion concerning the Subterranean Chamber may be
summarized as follows: (i) it is not a prehistoric feature, but was built at
the same time as the Pyramid (i.e. around 2500 bc); (2) it was initially
intended to be the burial place of Khufu; (3) then the Pharaoh and his
architects changed their minds, stopped work on it, and turned their
attentions to the main body of the Pyramid - where they built first the
Queen’s Chamber (also later ‘abandoned’ according to this theory) and
then finally the King’s Chamber.^’
If the Egyptologists are right then the excavation and removal of more
than 2000 tons of solid rock in order to create the Descending Corridor
rock that first had to be mined and then hauled to the surface from
increasingly greater depths through that cramped, unventilated, 26
degree channel - would all have been undertaken in vain. Vain, too, would
have been the hewing out of the Subterranean Chamber itself, and also of



50 Enigmas
its further shafts and pits. Indeed the whole enterprise would, in
retrospect, have been entirely pointless ifthe end result had merely been to
leave, at a depth of more than too feet below the Giza plateau, an
unfinished, rough-walled, low-ceilinged crypt - ‘resembling a quarry’^*
for which nobody would ever have arty use.
This obviously defies common sense. An alternative scenario does exist,
however, which has stimulated the curiosity of a number of investigators
during the last two centuries. According to this scenario the Chamber was
deliberately left unfinished so as to hoodwink treasure hunters into
believing that it had been abandoned and thus convince them of the
pointlessness of further explorations there - a pretty effective means of
keeping casual intruders away from any other cavities or concealed
passageways that might be connected to it.
With such suspicions in mind, the Italian explorer Giovanni Battista
Caviglia and the British adventurer Colonel Howard Vyse both felt
inspired (between 1830 and 1837) to drill holes into the bottom ofthe pit at
the centre ofthe Subterranean Chamber. They extended its original depth
of 10 feet by a further 35 feet (now largely filled in).
Alore recently the French archaeologist, Andre Pochan, has drawn
attention to a curious passage from the Greek historian Herodotus who
visited Egypt in the fifth century bc and spent much time interviewing
priests and other learned men there. Herodotus reports that he was told
quite specifically ofthe existence of‘underground chambers on the hill on
which the Pyramids stand . . . These chambers King Cheops [Khufu]
made as burial chambers for himself in a kind of island, bringing in a
channel from the Nile . .
Pochan has calculated that if there really is a chamber fed by Nile water
under the Pyramid, then it would have to be at a great depth — at least 90
feet below the pit. Likewise the Danish architect Hubert Paulsen has
argued on the basis of geometry that the most probable place for any
further chamber to be found in the Great Pyramid is underneath the pit'*®
a view that is also supported by the calculations of the British geometer Robin Cook.'*'
It is a French engineer, however. Professor Jean Kerisel, who has most
vigorously pursued the quest for concealed subterranean chambers. The
current President ofthe Association France-Egypte, he was in the pit with



Mystery Piled upon Mystery 51
his assistants on 12 October 1992 when a major earthquake occurred,
demolishing large parts of Cairo. This experience, he stated later, gave the
researchers ‘a few very unpleasant moments some 35 metres under the
plateau’.'^^
Happily, the Subterranean Chamber did not collapse and Kerisel and
his team were able to finish their work. This involved the use of two non¬
destructive techniques: ground-penetrating radar and microgravimetry.
The results were inconclusive in the chamber itself but extremely
promising in the horizontal passageway that connects it to the end of the
Descending Corridor. In Kerisel’s own words: ‘a structure was detected
under the floor of the passageway, which could be a corridor oriented
SSE—NNW whose ceiling is at the depth that the Descending Corridor
would have reached had it been prolonged.
Nor was this all. A second very clear anomaly, a ‘mass defect’ as Kerisel
calls it, ‘was detected on the western side of the passageway six metres
before the chamber entrance. According to our calculations, this anomaly
corresponds to a vertical shaft at least five metres deep with a section of
about 1.40 X 1.40 metres very close to the western wall of the
*44
passageway.
In short, what Kerisel believes he has identified off the Subterranean
Chamber’s entrance corridor is something that looks very much like a
completely separate passageway system, terminating in a vertical shaft.
His instruments may have misled him, or, as he himself admits, he may
merely have picked up the traces of‘a large volume of limestone dissolved
by the action of underground water - in other words a deep cave’."*^
Alternatively, however, if the ‘mass defect’ turns out to be a man-made
feature, as he strongly suspects, then ‘it may lead to very interesting
developments’.'^
Labyrinth
It should be obvious that a civihzation that could build up to the height of
the Great Pyramid’s summit platform, that could create giant stone
statues more than 240 feet long, and that could lift the 200-ton blocks of
the Valley and Mortuary Temples into place (forming intricate jigsaw
puzzle patterns at heights of40 feet and more above the ground) would not
have experienced any unsurmountable difficulty in building down as well.



52 Enigmas
On the contrary, such a civilization could, if it had so wished, have hewn
out underground complexes ofimmense size, connected to one another by
labyrinths of tunnels.
The possibility therefore cannot be ruled out that the Subterranean
Chamber under the Great Pyramid could be just one of many such deeply
buried features. Indeed, as the reader will recall, the seismological work
carried out at Giza in the early 1990s by the American geophysicist
Thomas Dobecki did indicate the presence of a large and apparently man¬
made hypogeum in the bedrock beneath the Sphinx. Ultimately only
further excavations and research can shed further light on these matters.
Meanwhile, however, there is a great deal of evidence from all parts of the
necropolis which suggests that the creation of ambitious rock-hewn
structures - both above and below the ground - was, indeed, part of the
standard repertoire of the Pyramid builders. They also quite frequently
chose to mingle rock-hewn and built-up structures - as in the case of the
tomb of Khent-Khawes, a supposed Queen of Menkaure, which consists
of a natural outcropping sculpted in pyramidial form surmounted by a
curious sarcophagus-shaped temple.
A more spectacular and conspicuous mixture of rock-hewn and built
up features occurs at the Pyramid of Khafre. It stands on an artificially
levelled 12-acre platform cut bodily out of the plateau - which slopes
steeply from north-west to south-east at this point (i.e. it is higher in the
west and lower in the east). In consequence the north and west sides ofthe
Pyramid are enclosed within a trench that decreases steadily in height
from about 20 feet at the north-west comer to about 10 feet at the south¬
west comer - and to zero at the north-east and south-east comers. The
lower courses of the Pyramid itself on the north and west sides are
contoured out of the central mound of bedrock that the builders left in
place after hollowing out the trench. On the east and south sides, however,
the slope of the plateau falls below the level chosen for the base of the
Pyramid. The builders solved this problem by bringing thousands of
enormous filling blocks to the site - average weight about too tons each
to create an unshakable horizontal foundation. They then went on to lay
the first few courses of the monument on the eastern and southern sides
using the same unwieldy megaliths. Thereafter they reverted to smaller
blocks and in consequence a clear demarcation line is visible between the
two types of construction. Like some of the characteristics of the Sphinx



Mystery Piled upon Mystery 53
and Valley Temples referred to earlier, this demarcation gives the
impression not just of different building techniques but actually of two
distinctly different stages of building separated by an unknown interval of
time.
The mystery of the shafts
There is one other anomalous feature of the Giza necropolis which we
have not yet mentioned but with which we shall close this chapter as it
leads us on to the next stage of our investigation. This feature is confined
to the Great Pyramid and is unique in ancient Egyptian architecture. It
takes the form of four narrow shafts - usually described by Egyptologists
as ‘ventilation channels’ - two of which emanate respectively from the
northern and southern walls of the King’s Chamber and the other two
from the northern and southern walls of the Queen’s Chamber.
The four shafts have an average cross-section of 23 x 22 cms and
lengths that vary from about 24 metres (northern shaft of the Queen’s
Chamber) to about 65 metres (northern shaft of the King’s Chamber).
They are all inclined to the horizontal plane of the Pyramid and their
angles of slope vary from 32 degrees 28 minutes (northern shaft of the
King’s Chamber) to 45 degrees 14 minutes (southern shaft of the King’s
Chamber). The shafts were constructed in a step-by-step manner as the
Pyramid rose in height (i.e. they were not drilled through the masonry as
some have supposed) and they reveal the use of very complex and
sophisticated engineering and levelling techniques.
It has been suggested that the reason for their inclination was to find the
‘shortest route’ to the outside of the Pyramid and this has been taken to
imply that the ancient builders wanted to ‘save’ work and time. However,
such geometrical logic goes very much against engineering logic - for the
simple reason that building shafts on an incline would not save time or
work at all. Quite the contrary: no construction engineer or builder could
possibly agree that the ‘shortest route’ is the best route in this case - even
though it may seem so to those looking only at the geometry. The truth, as
Egyptian architect Dr Alexander Badawy first noted in the 1960s, is that to
build inclined shafts rather than to have simple horizontal channels
leading to the outside of the Pyramid would create many difficulties - and
especially so when we consider the high precision and rigid consistency of
the inclinations.'^’

operations First, the base course must be prepared; this calls for the

with U-shaped inner faces to form the profile, i.e, the ‘walls’ and ‘ceilings’'
of the shafts. Thirdly, yet more special blocks have to be cut with their
undersides inclined in order to cover the sides of the shafts. Fourthly the
tops of the shafts must be covered with other special blocks with sloping
undersides. Fifthly, the main masonry courses of the Pyramid have to be
integrated with these special design features along the entire lengths ofthe

If ventilation was really the objective then the question that must be
asked is this: why opt for such complications and difficulties when an
effective flow of air could have been provided for the chambers in a much
simpler way.? From an engineer’s point ofview the obvious solution would
have been to leave a masonry joint open - say 20 cms - running
horizontally from the top of each chamber right to the outside of the
monument. In this case no special cutting of blocks would have been
necessary, nor indeed any tedious alignments or levelling work.
In other words the ‘shortest route’ is not by any means the best route for
the practical purposes ofventilation and, besides, it should be obvious that
the Pyramid builders were not interested in time/energy-saving schemes

Otherwise they would not have favoured such gigantic, multimillion-ton
monuments in the first place. It therefore follows that we are unlikely to be
rewarded in seeking an explanation for the precise north-south alignments
of these steeply inclined shafts in terms of a time/energy-saving rationale based on quaint geometrical figures.
Any doubt over this issue can be resolved by a close study of the shafts
of the a>«en s Chambet. Unlike the King’s Chamber shafts, those in the
Queen s Chamber (a) do not exit on the outside of the monument and (b)
were not ongmaUy cut through the Chamber’s limestone walls. Instead
e builders left the last five inches intact in the last block over the mouth
of each of the shafts - thus rendering them invisible and inacccessible to
any casual intruder. With the help of a steel chisel, they were finally

14. Construction details of the Great Pyramid’s shafts. At least four different kinds of blocks
(A, B, C and D), continuing the full length of the shafts, were required for the successful
completion ofthese mysterious features ofthe Pyramid. The engineering problems would have
been immense. The notion that the primary purpose of the shafts was for ventilation is
disproved by the fact that the Queen’s Chamber shafts were originally closed at both ends and
by the complexity of the design - which would not have been necessary if simple ventilation had been the objective.
discovered in 1872 by the British engineer Waynman Dixon, a Freemason
whose curiosity had been aroused by the shafts in the King’s Chamber and
who decided to look for similar features in the Queen’s Chamber.
In later chapters we will be considering the implications of Dixon’s
1872 discovery, and the follow-up to it. The point that we wish to make
here, however, is the obvious one that shafts which were originally closed
at both ends could not possibly have been used, or intended, for
ventilation. They must, therefore, have had some higher purpose - one
that was thought by the builders to justify the enormous care, skill and
effort involved in constructing them.
As we shall see, that ‘higher purpose’ can now be identified with
certainty.

heavenly bodies which are produced by the
rotation and revolution of the earth, and the
effects of precession, were familiar to the

J. Norman Lockyer, The Dawn Of
Astronomy, 1894
It is humbling and awe-inspiring to stand at dawn between the paws ofthe
Great Sphinx ofEgypt and to look up as the rising sun illuminates its face.
The colossal statue seems ancient - almost as old, one might imagine, as
time Itself And, as we saw in Chapter 2, a mounting body of geological
evidence suggests that it « ancient - vastly older than the 4500 years
allocated to it by Egyptologists and perhaps dating back as far as the last
Ice Age when no civilization capable of fashioning such a monument is supposed to have existed.
Such notions are of course controversial and hotly disputed. Moreover,
as should be obvious by now, geology is incapable of providing us with a
precise chronology and is particularly limited by the present state of our
knowledge ofpalaeo-climatology. Indeed, the most we can say, on the sole
basis of the monument’s erosion patterns, is that it does appear to have
been carved at a much earlier date than Egyptologists believe but that its
antiquity could range anywhere between 15,000 bc and 5000 BC
There is, however, another science which, provided one essential
precondition is fulfilled, can provide a much more accurate dating - to
within a few decades - of uninscribed ancient stone monuments. This is

serves as a superb equinoctial marker or ‘pointer’.
the science of archaeoastronomy. The precondition upon which it
depends for its successful functioning is that the monuments studied
should have been accurately aligned to the stars or to the rising points of
the sun by their builders.
The Great Sphinx fulfils this precondition. It lies exactly along the east
west axis of the Giza necropolis with its patient and eternal gaze set
perfectly towards due east. It is, therefore, a superb ‘equinoctial marker’:
its eyes target the exact position of sunrise at dawn on the spring equinox.
To clarify matters a little, astronomers speak offour ‘cardinal moments’
in the year: the summer solstice - the longest day in the northern
hemisphere - when the earth’s north pole points most directly at the sun,
the winter solstice, the shortest day, when the pole points most directly
away from the sun, and the spring and autumn equinoxes when the earth
lies broadside-on to the sun and when night and day are of equal length.



6o Enigmas
On the summer solstice at the latitude of Giza, the sun "rises about 28
degrees north ofeast. On the winter solstice it rises about 28 degrees south
of east. By contrast, the main characteristic of the equinoxes (here and
everywhere else around the globe) is that the sun always rises due east
providing a sure and accurate geodetic reference to one of the cardinal
directions.
It is towards this reference point, with high precision, that the gaze of
the Sphinx is set - not by accident, but by design, and as part of a vast,
archaic astronomical plan of uncanny accuracy and intelligence.
Observatory
Thousands of years ago, under the clear skies ofa younger world, Egypt’s
Giza plateau must have been the ultimate observatory. From the high
ground half a mile to the west of the Sphinx on which the three principal
Pyramids stand, there would have been a faultless 360-degree view around
an enormous circular horizon - a prospect that would have invited
observations of the rising and setting points of the sun throughout the
year, and also of the rising and setting points of the stars. It is certain,
furthermore, whatever the other functions of the necropolis, that it wa^
indeed used for practical and precise observational astronomy of the kind
developed by navigators to pinpoint the positions of ships on the open
ocean. Like the ability to keep strictly to a chosen course, the fabulous
accuracy with which the principal monuments of Giza are aligned to true
north, south, east and west could not have been achieved by any other science.*
Details of these alignments have already been given in Chapter 3. It is
therefore sufficient here to remind ourselves that the Great Pyramid
stands at a point on the earth’s surface exactly one third ofthe way between
the equator and the north pole (i.e. astride latitude 30) and that its
meridional’ (i.e. north-south) axis is aligned to within three-sixtieths of a
single degree oftrue north-south. It is a small but significant point that this
alignment is more accurate than that of the Meridian Building at the
Greenwich Observatory in London - which is offset by an error of nine
sixtieths of a degree. In our opinion, such precision constitutes a ‘fact’

which archaeologists and Egyptologists have never seriously considered,
i.e. that the Great Pyramid, with its 13-acre footprint and six million tons
of mass, could only have been surveyed and set out by master astronomers.^
It is our conviction that this ‘astronomical factor’ deserves to be given
much greater prominence than it has hitherto been accorded by
Egyptologists. Moreover, thanks to the recent development of sophisti¬
cated star-mapping computer programs, it is possible for us to simulate
the skies over Giza in any epoch during the past 30,000 years and thus to
recreate the celestial environment in which the Pyramid builders worked.
Standing as it were beneath those ancient skies, initiated by microchip
into the cosmic secret of the changing positions of the stars, certain
features of the key monuments - features that are of no significance from
the purely archaeological or Egyptological perspective - begin to take on a peculiar meaning.

two of these shafts are aligned perfectly to due north and the other two
perfectly to due south. They thus target, at varying altitudes, what
astronomers refer to as the ‘meridian’ - an imaginary hne ‘dividing the
sky that is best envisaged as a hoop connecting the north and south poles
and passing directly over the observer’s head. It is as they cross this
imaginary line (‘transit the meridian’) that the stars (and also the sun
moon and planets) are said to ‘culminate’ - that is, reach their maximum altitude above the horizon.
The Great Pyramid has numerous features which leave us without any
doubt that its designers paid careful attention to the stars and tracked their
transit at the meridian. The mouth of the original entrance corridor, for
example, targets the meridian with the precision ofthe barrel ofan artillery
piece. AU the internal passageways, too, run perfectly north-south, thus
niaking the whole monument, as many astronomers have noted an
obvious ‘meridional instrument’.^ Most conclusive of all, however is’ the
fine accuracy of the four shafts. Recent investigations have established



Stars and Time 65
beyond any shadow of doubt that in circa 2500 BC — the era recognized by
Egyptologists as the ‘Pyramid Age’ - each one of these shafts targeted a
special star as it culminated at the meridian;
From the Queen’s Chamber, the northern shaft is angled at 39 degrees and was
aimed at the star Kochab (Beta Ursa Minor) in the constellation of the Little
Bear - a star associated by the ancients with ‘cosmic regeneration’ and the
immortality of the soul. The southern shaft, on the other hand, which is
angled at 39 degrees 30', was aimed at the bright star Sirius (Alpha Canis
Major) in the constellation of the Great Dog. This star the ancients associated
with the goddess Isis, cosmic mother of the kings of Egypt.^
From the King’s Chamber, the northern shaft is angled at 32 degrees 28'
and was aimed at the ancient Pole star, Thuban (Alpha Draconis) in the
constellation of the Dragon — associated by the Pharaohs with notions of
‘cosmic pregnancy and gestation’. The southern shaft, which is angled at 45
degrees 14', was aimed aty4/ Nitak (Zeta Orionis), the brightest (and also the
lowest) of the three stars of Orion’s belt — which the ancient Egyptians
identified with Osiris, their high god of resurrection and rebirth and the
legendary bringer of civilization to the Nile Valley in a remote epoch referred
to as Zep Tepi, the ‘First Time’.’
Because we can reconstruct the ancient skies over Giza with modem
computers we can demonstrate the spot-on alignments ofthe four shafts to
the four stars circa 2500 BC. What the same computers also show us is that
these alignments were rare and fleeting, only valid for a century or so,
before the continuous gradual change effected in stellar altitudes by the
passage of time altered the positions at which the stars transited the
meridian.
This phenomenon, the result of a slow and stately wobble in the axis of
the earth, is known technically as precession. Over a cycle of 25,920 years
it causes the infinitely-extended north pole ofour planet’s spin axis to trace
out a great circle in the heavens. The main astronomical effects of this
motion are:
1 an equally slow and stately change in the celestial north pole — which
sometimes coincides with a ‘pole star’ (and sometimes with empty
space) as it progresses eternally around its 25,920-year cycle;
2 changes in the altitude of all stars above the horizon as they cross the
observer’s meridian at any given latitude;



66 Enigmas
3 changes in the constellations against the background of which the sun
rises due east at dawn on the spring equinox (naturally precession also
changes the constellations that mark the autumnal equinox — and the
winter and summer solstices as well).
The rate of processional change is constant and predictable for each of
these key astronomical effects and can be calculated backwards and
forwards in time across the entire star-field. This means, for example, that
if we were to observe a specific bright star - say AlNitak in Orion’s belt
from a given place today, and if we were to record its altitude at the
meridian, then provided such a record was to be found and understood
thousands of years hence it could be used to determine the epoch or ‘time’
when the original observation was made.
The same logic can be applied to the four meridional shafts emanating
from the King s and Queen’s Chambers. Their alignments at 2500 bc — on
four stars that were of ritual importance within the ‘Osiris cycle’ of beliefs
- cannot possibly have been accidental. On the contrary, it is obvious that
we are confronted here by the products of a conscious and careful design.
This in turn makes it equally obvious that the Great Pyramid must have
some extremely strong connection with the epoch of 2500 bc - the
approximate date at which all orthodox Egyptologists and archaeologists
in fact believe it to have been built.
In short, the four star-shafts serve as precise time-markers by which, in
theory at least, we should be able once and for all to confirm the date for Ae
construction of the last-surviving wonder of the ancient world. This
would be highly desirable since, in the absence ofother objective means of
dating the monument, controversy continues to linger over its exact age.
However, the archaeoastronomical picture is rather more complicated than it seems.
The Companions of Osiris
The complication arises from the strong correlation, first demonstrated in
The Orton Mystery, between the three belt stars of the Orion constellation
and the ground-plan of the three Pyramids of Giza. An overhead view
shows that the Great Pyramid and the second Pyramid stretch out along a



Stars and Time 67
diagonal running 45 degrees to the south and west of the former’s eastern
face. The third Pyramid, however, is offset somewhat to the east of this
line. The resulting pattern mimics the sky where the three stars of Orion’s
belt also stretch out along a ‘faulty’ diagonal. The first two stars {Al Nitak
and Al Nilam) are in direct alignment, hke the first and second Pyramids,
and the third star (Mintaka) lies offset somewhat to the east of the axis
formed by the other two.^
The visual correlation, once observed, is obvious and striking on its
own. Additional confirmation of its symbolic significance, however, is
provided by the Milky Way, which the ancient Egyptians regarded as a
kind of ‘Celestial Nile’ and which was spoken of in archaic funerary texts
as the ‘Winding Waterway’.’ In the heavenly vault the belt stars of Orion
lie to the west of the Milky Way, as though overlooking its banks; on the
ground the Pyramids stand perched above the west bank of the Nile.*
Faced by such symmetry, and by such a complex pattern ofinterlocking
architectural and religious ideas, it is hard to resist the conclusion that the
Pyramids of Giza represent a successful attempt to build Orion’s belt on
the ground. This makes all the more sense when we recall the firm
identification of the Orion constellation with the high god Osiris.
But bearing in mind the changes induced by the phenomenon of
precession we must also ask: ‘Orion’s belt rvhenV ‘Orion’s belt in what
epoch?’

A perfect match
From the evidence of the shafts we have seen how the Great Pyramid is
‘precessionally anchored’ to Orion’s belt in 2500 bc (because in this epoch
the southern shaft of the King’s Chamber targeted the meridian-transit of
Al Nitak, the Great Pyramid’s celestial counterpart). If we set our
processional computer to reconstruct the ancient skies over Giza,
however, turn our attention to the pattern formed on the ground by all
three of the Pyramids in 2500 BC, simulate the nightly passage of the belt
stars across the roof of the celestial sphere and bring them to rest at the
point of Al Nitak's meridian-transit (45 degrees above the southern
horizon, where it is targeted by the King’s Chamber shaft), it becomes
apparent that something is not quite right.

needs somehow to be ‘twisted’ in an anti-clockwise direction to get the perfect match. This cln

24. The perfect match of sky-ground images is achieved in 10,500 BC when the pattern of the
Milky Way and of the three stars ofOrion’s belt at meridian transit is precisely matched by the
course of the Nile and the pattern of the three great Pyramids on the ground.



70 Enigmas
We should expect to see a perfect meridian-to-meridiMi alignment at
this point. Instead we notice that the dominant axis of the three stars and
the Milky Way lies tilted conspicuously askew relative to the dominant
axis ofthe three Pyramids and the Nile. These latter, ofcourse, are fixed in
their places. What is required, therefore, in order to achieve the ‘ideal’
sky-ground arrangement, is somehow to ‘rotate’ the heavens in an anti¬
clockwise direction.
The vast cosmic engine of the earth’s axial wobble offers us a
mechanism by which this can be done: we need only instruct our computer
to track the precessionally induced movements of the stars backwards in time.
As it does so, millennium by millennium, we observe that the
orientation of Orion’s belt at culmination is slowly rotating anti-clockwise
and thus approaching ever closer to our desired meridian-to-meridian
match. It is not until 10,500 BC, however — 8000 years before the ‘Pyramid
Age’ - that the perfect correlation is finally achieved with the Nile
mirroring the Milky Way and with the three Pyramids and the belt stars
identically disposed in relation to the meridian.’
Rising stars
There is a feature of this 10,500 bc correlation which suggests strongly
that coincidence is not involved. The pattern that is frozen into
monumental architecture in the form of the Pyramids marks a very
significant moment in the 25,920-year precessional cycle ofthe three stars of
Orion’s belt - one that is unlikely to have been randomly selected by the
Pyramid builders.
To get a clear grasp of what is involved here let us call up a computer
simulation ofthe skies over Giza in our own epoch, circa ad 2000. Looking
due south we note that Al Nitak crosses the meridian at an altitude
of 58 degrees 06 above the horizon. This, as it happens, is within 8
minutes of the highest altitude that this star will attain in its precessional
cycle, i.e. 58 degrees 14' (to be reached at around ad 2500)."’
Let us now project our simulation backwards in time and recreate the
sky as we would see it if we were standing in the same position at around
10,500 BC - i.e. just under 13,000 years, or halfa precessional cycle, earlier.
In this remote epoch we discover xhztAl Nitak crosses the meridian at an

25. By mimicking the sky pattern ofOrion’s belt in 10,500 BC the three great Pyramids of Giza
mark a very significant moment in the 26,000-year precessional cycle ofthese stars - the lowest
point in their slide up and down the meridian, when (as seen from the latitude of Giza) they
culminated at an altitude of 9 degrees 20 minutes above the horizon (C). In 2500 BC they
culminated at altitude 45 degrees (B). In our own epoch, 2000 AD (A) they are approaching the
highest altitude that they will attain in their precessional cycle — 58 degrees 06 minutes above
the horizon at meridian transit.
altitude of only 9 degrees 20' above the horizon."
It will never fall lower, the epoch of 10,500 BC marks the nadir of the
star’s precessionally induced slide up and down the meridian (just as the
epoch ofAD 2500 marks its zenith). Like a slowly moving lever in a narrow
vertical slot, it takes 12,960 years to descend from top to bottom, and a
further 12,960 years to ascend from bottom to top again."
By exactly mimicking the disposition of the belt stars in the sky in
10,500 BC the layout of the Pyramids on the ground thus not only signifies
a specific epoch but also rather precisely and surgically marks the beginning
of a precessional half-cycle.
Lion on the ground, lion in the sky
As was pointed out in Fingerprints ofthe Gods., the same role is played by
the Great Sphinx - which gazes directly at the equinoctial rising point of
the sun in any and every epoch, past, present and future, for ever.

This orientation provides us with an astronomical basis for dating the
monument because it is known that the attention ofastronomers in ancient
times was particularly focused on the zodiacal constellation - considered
to define the astrological ‘Age’ - that rose just ahead of the sun in the
eastern sky at dawn on the spring equinox.'^ The same phenomenon ofthe
earth’s axial precession that affects the altitude ofstars at the meridian also
affects these famous constellations - Leo, Cancer, Gemini, Taurus, Aries,
Pisces, Aquarius, etc., etc - the co-ordinates of which, in relation to the
rising point of the equinoctial sun, undergo slow but continuous
precessionally induced changes. The result is a hard-to-observe
astronomical phenomenon, known as the precession of the equinoxes,
which manifests as a gradual circulation ofthe equinoctial point around all
twelve ‘houses’ ofthe zodiac. In the words of historians of science Giorgio
de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend, whose essay Hamlet's Mill is a
ground-breaking study of archaic processional mythology:
The constellation that rose in the east just before the sun (that is, rose
heliacally) marked the ‘place’ where the sun rested ... It was known as the
sun’s ‘carrier’, and as the main ‘pillar’ of the sky . . . .The sun’s position
among the constellations at the vernal [spring] equinox was the pointer that
indicated the ‘hours’ of the precessional cycle - very long hours indeed, the
equinoctial sun occupying each zodiacal constellation for just under 2200
years.''*



74 Enigmas
In our own epoch the sun on the spring equinox rises agamst the stellar
background of the constellation of Pisces, as it has done for approximately
the last 2000 years. The ‘Age of Pisces’, however, is now approaching its
end and the vernal sun will soon pass out of the sector of the Fishes and
begin to rise against the new background of Aquarius. To be precise, it
takes exactly 2160 years for the equinoctial point to pass completely
through one constellation or ‘house’ of the zodiac.
With this process in mind, let us now reverse Santillana and von
Dechend’s ‘processional clock’. Passing back through the Age of Pisces
(and the Age ofAries that preceded it) we find that in the epoch of2500 bc,
when the Sphinx is conventionally assumed to have been built, it was the
constellation of Taurus that housed the sun on the spring equinox.
It is here that the crux of the problem lies. To state the case briefly:
1 The Sphinx, as we have seen, is an equinoctial marker - or ‘pointer’.
2 On a site that is as profoundly astronomical as Giza one would
naturally expect an equinoctial monument dating from the ‘Age of
Taurus either to have been built in the shape of a bull, or at any rate
to symbolize a bull. The Sphinx, however, is emphatically leonine in
form.
3 It is a simple fact of precession that one must go back to the ‘Age of
Leo’ beginning at around 10,500 bc, in order to obtain the ‘correct’
sky-ground symbolism. This, as it turns out, is the only epoch in
which the due-east-facing Sphinx would have manifested exactly the
right symbolic alignment on exactly the right day - watching the
vernal sun rising in the dawn sky against the background of his own
celestial counterpart.'^
To clarify this latter notion, let us return to our computer simulation of
the skies over Giza in 10,500 bc, instructing the program to recreate the
positions of the sun and stars just before dawn on the spring equinox in
that epoch. And let us set our direction of view due east in line with the
gaze of the Sphinx. Indeed, with the aid of a little virtual reality and poetic
licence, let us imagine that we are standing between the paws ofthe Sphinx
Itself at that date - a date that we already know accords rather well with the
geology of the monument.
What we would see, occupying the portion ofthe sky into which the sun
is about to rise, would be the splendid zodiacal constellation of Leo - a

Xhe minutes pass. The sky begins to lighten. Then, at the exact
moment at which the top of the solar disc breaks over the horizon directly
ahead of us we make a 90-degree right turn - so that we are now looking
due south. There, culminating at the meridian at altitude 9 degrees 20', we
observe the three stars of Orion’s belt forming a pattern in the sky that is
identical to the ground plan of the Giza Pyramids.
The question reduces to this: is it a coincidence, or more than a
coincidence, that the Giza necropolis as it has reached us today out of the
darkness of antiquity is still dominated by a huge equinoctial lion statue at
the east of its horizon’ and by three gigantic Pyramids disposed about its
meridian in the distinctive manner of the three stars of Orion’s belt in 10,500 BC.?

together’ as an architectural representation of this unique celestial conjunction.



78 Enigmas
And is it also a coincidence that the monuments in this amazing
astronomical theme park manage to work together — almost as though
geared like the cog-wheels of a clock - to tell the same 'time'}
Throughout the ancient world the moment of sunrise, and its
conjunction with other celestial events, was always considered to be of
great importance.’® At the spring equinox in 10,500 BC, as should by now
be obvious, a particularly spectacular and statistically improbable con¬
junction took place - a conjunction involving the moment of sunrise, the
constellation of Leo and the meridian transit of the three stars of Orion’s
belt. It is this unique celestial conjunction (which furthermore marks the
beginning of the ‘Age ofLeo’ and the beginning ofthe upwards precessional
cycle of the belt stars) that the Great Sphinx and the three Pyramids of
Giza appear to model.
But why should the ancients have sought to create a simulacrum of the
skies on the ground at Giza.?
Or, to put the question another way, why should they have sought to
bring down to earth an image of the heavens.?
Motive in the texts
There exists an ancient body of writings, compiled in Greek in the
city of Alexandria in the early centuries of the Christian era, in
which sky-ground dualisms form a predominant theme, linked in
numerous convoluted ways to the issue of the resurrection and immortal¬
ity ofthe soul. These writings, the ‘Hermetic Texts’, were believed to have
been the work of the ancient Egyptian wisdom god Thoth (known to the
Greeks as Hermes), who in one representative passage makes the
following remarks to his disciple Asclepius: ‘Do you not know, Asclepius,
that Egypt is an image of heaven.? Or, so to speak more exactly, in Egypt all
the operations of the powers which rule and work in heaven have been
transferred down to earth below.?”' The purpose to which these powers
were harnessed, in the Hermetic view, was to facilitate the initiate’s quest for immortality.
Curiously, precisely such a quest for precisely such a goal — ‘a life of
millions of years’ - is spelled out in ancient Egyptian funerary texts which
supposedly pre-date the Hermetic writings by thousands of years. In one
ofthese texts. Shat EntAm Duat—xht Book ofWhat is in the Duat—we find



Stars and Time 79
what appears to be an explicit instruction to the initiate to build a replica
on the ground of a special area ofthe sky known as the ‘hidden circle ofthe
Duat’: ‘Whosoever shall make an exact copy of these forms . . . and shall
know it, shall be a spirit and well equipped both in heaven and earth,
unfailingly, and regularly and eternally.”*
Elsewhere in the same text we hear again of ‘the hidden Circle in the
Duat ... in the body of Nut [the sky]’: ‘Whosoever shall make a copy
thereof... it shall act as a magical protector for him both in heaven and
upon earth.’’’
We suspect that the ideas expressed in such utterances may hint at the
true motive for the construction of the huge astronomical monuments of
the Giza necropohs and may help us to find a coherent explanation for
their precise ahgnments to the cardinal directions of the sky, their unique
‘star shafts’, and their intense celestial symbolism. At any rate, as we shall
demonstrate in Parts III and IV, it is a fact that the Duat sky-region
described in the ancient Egyptian texts was dominated by the constella¬
tions of Orion and Leo — both of which appear to have been ‘imaged’ on
the groimd at Giza (with the former additionally targeted by the southern
shaft of the King’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid) — and by the star
Sirius, which was targeted by the southern shaft of the Queen’s Chamber.
We also note in passing that the internal corridor, passageway and
chamber systems of the Pyramids very closely resemble surviving
vignettes (painted on Eighteenth Dynasty tomb walls) of various regions
of the Duat. Of particular interest in this regard is the mysterious
‘Kingdom of Sokar’ in the ‘Fifth Division of the Duat' in which ‘travellers
upon the way of the holy country . . . enter into the hidden place of the
Duat.'^
As we shall also see in Parts III and IV, there are the repeated references
in the Book of What is in the Duat., and in numerous other funerary and
rebirth texts, to Zep Tepi, the ‘First Time’ - the remote epoch when the
gods were believed to have come to earth and established their kingdom
in Egypt.^’ Those gods included Thoth-Hermes, the ‘Thrice-Great’
master of wisdom, the goddess Isis whose celestial counterpart was the
star Sirius, and Osiris, the ‘once and future king’, who was killed, revenged
by his son Horus, and then reborn to live for ever as the ‘Lord of the

The celestial counterpart of Osiris was Orion - a constellation that the
ancient Egyptians knew as Sah, the ‘Far-Strider’ and most frequently
depicted by means of the three characterstic belt stars. And since Osiris
was said to have ruled in the ‘First Time’ we wonder whether this could be
the reason why the three great Pyramids of Giza depict the three stars of
Orion’s belt as they looked 12,500 years ago at what might reasonably be
defined as their astronomical ‘First Time’ - i.e. at the beginning of their
current upwards precessional cycle.?
An even bigger question, upon which much ofour investigation hinges,
concerns the identification of the Sphinx with the constellation of Leo
and specifically with the constellation of Leo when it marked the spring
equinox in 10,500 BC. In Parts III and IV we will follow astronomical clues,
laid out in the ancient Egyptian texts, which strongly support this
identification and which offer intriguing hints as to its implications.

Fundamental questions
If the monuments of the Giza necropolis were of no significance in the
human story then problems in the study and interpretation of these
monuments would be of no significance either. But this site could hardly
be more significant. Indeed, there is a sense in which it has always been
with us. It is a marker of our history — a memorial to the genesis of our
civilization — and it may still have vital information to give us about
ourselves. More than any other ancient place, in other words, Giza raises,
and might possibly answer, all the old, fundamental questions: who we are,
where we came from, perhaps even where we are going. For these reasons
we can hardly afford to be indifferent to the Great Sphinx and the three
great Pyramids. For these reasons the quality of research that has been
carried out around them - and that has defined and explained them - really
does matter.
As we shall see in Part II this research has become strangely tangled up
with an ancient tradition of quest for hidden chambers and lost records at Giza. . .

The Case of the Psychic, the Scholar and the
Sphinx
‘There has been one systematic search, a sort
of direct shot at hnding the Hall of Records,
when the Edgar Cayce Foundation funded

Dr Mark Lehner, Edgar Cayce Foundation
and ARE Magazine Venture Inward, 1985
There is a tradition which asserts that the Giza monuments stand as a last
and grand memorial to a highly advanced antediluvian civilization that was
destroyed by a ‘Great Flood’. This tradition also holds that somewhere at
Giza, either beneath the Great Sphinx or within the Great Pyramid itself,
is concealed a ‘Hall ofRecords’ in which is preserved the entire knowledge
and wisdom of the lost civilization.
Such ideas may be of very archaic origin* and have continued
throughout history to inspire investigations at Giza. In the fourth century
AD, for example, the Roman Ammianus Marcellinus directed treasure
hunters to search for ‘certain underground galleries in the Pyramids’,
constructed as repositories for scrolls and books of past ages and intended
‘to prevent the ancient wisdom from being lost in the Flood.’ ^
Likewise, many of the Arab chroniclers from about the ninth century
AD onwards seem to have had access to a common source of information
which caused them to agree that the Great Pyramid was built ‘before the
Flood’ as a repository for scientific knowledge. Caliph A1 Mamoun, who
forced a tunnel into the northern face of the monument in ad 820, did so
out of a conviction that he was entering a relic from antediluvian times
which had been charged by its maker with the secrets of ‘all profound
science’, which could ‘convey knowledge ofboth history and astronomy’,^
and which would be found to contain ‘a secret chamber with maps and

terrestrial spheres’/
In a similar vein, a number of ancient Egyptian inscriptions and papyri
make tantalizing statements about hidden chambers — the Chamber of
Archives, the Hall of Records, etc., etc. — which have been interpreted as
references to a hypogeum beneath or close by the Sphinx.^ And Coptic
legends report that ‘there exists a single subterranean chamber under the
Sphinx with entrances to all three Pyramids . . . Each entrance is guarded
by statues of amazing abilities.’^
In modem times, ideas such as these have been kept very much ahve in
the doctrines of speculative Freemasonry’ and in the teachings of esoteric
schools like the AMORC Rosicmcians of California and the Theosophical
Society of London and Madras. In addition, from the 1920s to the 1940s,
almost identical notions were expressed with curious vehemence by the
American psychic Edgar Cayce, known to some as the ‘Sleeping Prophet’.
Since an examination of ‘psychic intuitions’ would take us far beyond
the intended scope of this book we shall offer no opinions on the merits or
the sources of Cayce s information. What we do find relevant to our
investigation, however, is that his pronouncements concerning a supposed
Atlantean Hall of Records at Giza have quietly spawned a multimillion
dollar New Age industry that has embroiled itself deeply with mainstream
Egyptological research into the Pyramids and the Sphinx.
We first learned about this unexpected involvement - unexpected
because psychics and Egyptologists are normally about as hard to mix as
chickens and polecats — when reviewing the numerous studies and
excavations undertaken at Giza by the American Egyptologist, Mark
Lehner. As the reader will recall from Part I, Professor Lehner has gone on
record several times during the 1990s to oppose the theory of a 12,500
year-old Sphinx — and any notion of a Hall of Records beneath it. During
the 1970S and 1980s, however, he was directly involved with the followers
of Edgar Cayce and with their distinctive beliefs about the secrets and mysteries of Giza.
Trancing the Hall of Records

Edgar Cayce was bom in Hopkinsville in Kentucky in 1877. At the age of
twenty he suffered from a speech impediment. After fruitless attempts to
have it diagnosed by local doctors, he discovered that he could put himself
into a deep trance and somehow diagnose the disorder and dictate a
remedy. Cayce was urged to try his technique on others — with results that
were so spectacularly successful that within months he had gained an
immense reputation as a ‘healer’ with the gift of inner vision. All sorts of
desperate people flocked to Virginia Beach to be diagnosed by the
‘Sleeping Prophet’.
In his trances Cayce would also give psychic ‘readings’ to his
enthusiastic followers — readings that were taken down in shorthand by a
secretary.* Cayce would always claim to have absolutely no recollection of
what happened during these trances, but the ‘readings’ show that he
frequently spoke to his followers about their ‘past lives’ in a remote epoch
- the epoch of ‘Atlantis’, before and after the terrible deluge which
supposedly destroyed that fabled continent. Altogether some 700 of
Cayce’s ‘life readings’ — now available on CD-ROM — expound in one way
or another on the so-called ‘Atlantean’ story which begins with
‘humankind’s arrival on earth some ten million years ago, and ends with
the sinking of the last remnants of Atlantis [prior to] 10,000 BC’.’
The essential message of these readings is that a number of‘Atlanteans’
escaped the destruction of their continent and somehow reached the Nile
Valley in Egypt in the eleventh millennium BC. Cayce himself claimed to
be the reincarnation of their high priest Ra-Ta. According to Dr Douglas
G. RichardSj director and researcher at the Atlantic University (which is



88 Seekers
part of the Edgar Cayce Foundation): ‘many who received life readings
[from Cayce] were said to have been associated with him in this past life’ in
prehistoric Egypt.'®
One of the most persistent accounts given by Edgar Cayce during his
deep trances concerned:
References and clues [which] indicate Egypt as a repository for records
records of Atlantis and ancient Egypt during the time of Ra-Ta, which may
some day be found. They also mention again and again tombs and pyramids
yet to be uncovered in Egypt, and give specific dates for the building of the
Great Pyramid."
The chronology that Cayce gave for this latter enterprise was ‘10,490 to
10,390 BC’.'^ He also stated: ‘. . . some 10,500 [years] before the coming of
the Christ. . . there was first that attempt to restore and add to that which
had been begun and what is called the Sphinx . . .’ Also at around 10,500
BC the Cayce readings state that a vast underground repository was
established containing a library of wisdom from the lost civilization of
Atlantis: ‘This in position lies, as the sun rises from the waters, the line of
shadow (or light) falls between the paws of the Sphinx . . . Between, then,
the Sphinx and the river . . In another reading Cayce gave even more
specific directions: ‘There is a chamber or passage from the right forepaw
[of the Sphinx] to this entrance of the record chamber . .
According to the readings, the Hall ofRecords is to be rediscovered and
re-entered when the time has been fulfilled’ — which, Cayce suggested,
would be at or just before the close of the twentieth century, perhaps in
1998.'^ The readings allude frequently to the Old and New Testaments of
the Bible, contain numerous references to Jesus, and depict the
rediscovery ofthe Hall ofRecords as being linked in some way to a series of
events that will prelude the ‘Second Coming’ of Christ.'®
The Scholar
The corporate history of the Association for Research and Enlightenment
(ARE) begins in 1931, when the management of the newly founded
institute was entrusted to Edgar Cayce’s eldest son, Hugh Lynn Cayce
who had just majored in psychology. His first task was to provide a
repository for his father’s growing library of psychic ‘readings’, a sort of
modem Hall of Records’ in Virginia Beach. This task was eventually



The Case of the Psychic, the Scholar and the Sphinx 89
completed after Edgar Cayce’s death in 1945. Meanwhile the ARE
continued to expand and today has flourished into a multimillion-dollar
organization with over 40,000 members world-wide. Unsurprisingly,
however, despite a diversity ofinterests, its major thrust continues to be to
prove the validity of the Edgar Cayce readings. What this involves in
practice is a concerted attempt to find the so-called ‘Hall of Records’ of
Atlantis which, as we have seen, is believed to have been preserved at Giza
since 10,500 bc under the Sphinx and which, as the prophet said, would be
opened before the year 2000. As two of Cayce’s own children recently
confirmed:
Over twenty years ago the ECF began to lay the groundwork for what would
later become actual fieldwork in Egypt. The specific areas of interest were the
Sphinx, the Great Pyramid, and the immediate surrounding area known as the
Giza plateau. The driving force for this research was Hugh Lynn Cayce.
Motivated by his father’s psychic readings, as well as a personal interest in
archaeology, he turned his energies and enthusiasm to initiating solid
archaeological research that might validate them ...”
In 1973 Hugh Lynn managed to round up a group of sponsors who were
ready to finance a long-term strategy in Egypt. First and foremost this
entailed providing an ‘academic scholarship . .. plus a small stipend’ to a
‘gifted individual’ who could become a respected Egyptologist and gain
the confidence of the leading lights of this stem profession.'*
The ‘gifted individual’ chosen to receive the stipend was Mark
Lehner,'’ until 1995 a Professor of Egyptology at the University of
Chicago’s world-famous Oriental Institute. Often referred to in Edgar
Cayce literature as ‘the scholar’, it appears that some time in 1973 Lehner
was earmarked by Hugh Lynn Cayce for a mission in Egypt which was
envisaged as follows:
The scholar could complete a degree in Cairo and gain first-hand experience
and make contacts in his field. For the ECF [Edgar Cayce Foundation], such
support could create a realistic perspective on research efforts in Egypt,
produce contacts, and lead eventually to research involvement in this area.
Although the scholar would be independent ofthe ECF, his presence in Egypt
would serve as an effective liaison or channel for the ECF to develop long-term
involvement there,“
Lehner arrived in Cairo in the fall of 1973 and studied at the American
University near A1 Tahrir Square - from whence he graduated in 1975



90 Seekers
with high honours:
After graduation the Edgar Cayce Foundation supported him as a research
fellow for several years in the department of anthropology. During this time,
the student not only continued his academic studies, but also made contacts
with people and organizations well known for their research. These contacts
made it possible for the ECF to sponsor - directly in some cases, and partially in others - actual field research.^’
Proof under the paws
In 1974 Lehner published a book. The Egyptian Heritage, which is
copyrighted to the Edgar Cayce Foundation and which bears the subtitle
Based on the Edgar Cayce Readings’. Its prime objective is to substantiate
Cayce s statements about the supposed ‘Atlantean connection’ in the
prehistory ofEgypt and the *Hall ofRecords’ established at Giza in 10,500
Bc:
According to the [Edgar Cayce] readings, it is a legacy which will soon be
rediscovered, and^will bear profound determinations - not only for the history
of dynastic Egypt, but for the entire physical and spiritual epic of our evolution on this planet, and for the years yet to pass.^^
In The Egyptian Heritage Lehner also informs us that:
There are 1159 Edgar Cayce readings which contain references and
information on the Ra-Ta period in Egypt. The story presented here has been
culled from approximately 300 of these readings ... In presenting correlative
Egyptological data I will attempt to demonstrate that there are good empirical
reasons for believing that the Ra-Ta story is, in fact, rooted in truth. Ofcourse,
the final confirmation lies beneath the paws of the Sphinx at Giza . . .^^
Anomalies
Naturally the prime area of interest of the ECF/ARE in terms of‘actual
field research was — and remains — scanning, drilling and excavation in the
vicinity of the Sphinx where the Cayce readings say that the ‘Hall of Records’ is located.
In 1973-4, while Mark Lehner was still a student at the American
University in Cairo, the first in a series of serious pioneering projects was
launched, using ground-penetrating radar and other high-tech remote
sensing equipment to locate ‘anomalies’ under the bedrock beneath the



The Case of the Psychic, the Scholar and the Sphinx 91
Sphinx. These projects were channelled through well-established aca¬
demic institutions - the Ain Shams University in Cairo and the
prestigious Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the USA.^"^
In 1977 the US National Science Foundation funded a project at Giza
again involving the SRI. This time use was made of several new
techniques such as resistivity measurements (from metal rods driven into
the rock across which an electric current was passed), magnetometry, and
also the latest aerial photography and thermal infrared image-enhancing
techniques. According to the SRI team’s official report: ‘Several
anomalies were observed as a result of our resistivity survey at the Sphinx
. . . Behind the rear paws (north-west end) we ran two traverses. Both
traverses indicate an anomaly that could possibly be due to a tunnel
aligned north-west to south-east. .
Two other ‘anomalies’ were noted, deep in the bedrock ‘in front of the
paws of the Sphinx’.
According to ECF/ARE historians the 1973-4 ^rid 1977 projects
‘paved the way for work . . . that would succeed in discovering hidden
chambers’.^’ Exactly how and where is not made clear. At any rate in 1978
the ECF/ARE collaborated with the SRI and provided funds (to the tune
of about US $50,000^*) for a more detailed survey of the Sphinx enclosure
and the nearby Sphinx Temple. The survey was recorded in the SRI’s
own records as ‘The Sphinx Exploration Project’. It entailed an extensive
resistivity scan of the entire floor of the Sphinx and Sphinx Temple
enclosures. Should any ‘anomalies’ be found, it was agreed that the SRI
was to confirm them with acoustic sounding techniques. The next step
was to have holes cut into the bedrock with precision drills through which
borescope cameras could then be inserted.
Several anomalies beneath the bedrock were indeed identified and
inspected in this way but proved to be just natural cavities.
A falling out
Also in 1978, US drilling experts from a company called Recovery
Systems International (RSI) arrived at Giza with a telescopic diesel
powered drill and official permits, under the direction of an American
named Kent Wakefield, to bore a number of holes deep beneath the
Sphinx.^’ There was more of a connection between the SRI and the RSI



92 Seekers
than the anagram formed by their initials. Recovery Systems Interna¬
tional, like the Edgar Cayce Foundation, apparently funded some of the
SRI’s programme at Giza, and made use of the SRJ’s resistivity readings
to guide the placement of their drill holes. According to Mark Lehner,
who was there at the time. Recovery Systems International was probably
organized ‘just for this project’.^®
The equipment for RSI’s work was air-freighted to Egypt and brought
to the site where it was positioned in the Sphinx Temple, directly in front
of the paws of the Sphinx itself. One hole was bored, uneventfully. A
second hole was then drilled. Mark Lehner and Kent Wakefield examined
this hole with a borescope and saw only ‘Swiss-cheese-like solution
cavities’ which form naturally in limestone. The solid bottom of the hole
was tapped with a plumb-bob by Lehner who concluded that there was nothing unusual about it.^*
Immediately afterwards the project was stopped. According to Mark
Lehner this abrupt halt was ‘due to lack of time [and] funds’.^^ Also it
seems that Recovery Systems International ‘did not appreciate at all the
Cayce component of the project’ and that this eventually led to a ‘serious
falling out between RSI and SRI’.^^
Granite structures
Shortly after this episode, in 1979, as we shall see in further detail below,
Mark Lehner got involved with the American Research Center in Egypt
(ARCE for short) - which is the officially registered American Egyptolog¬
ical mission in Egypt.'' At about the same time, Zahi Hawass, today the
Director-General of the Giza Pyramids, was supervising excavations 165
feet to the east of the Sphinx Temple and hit bedrock at a depth of only six
feet. A few months later, however - in 1980 - Egyptian irrigation
specialists checking for groundwater drilled in the same area, less than 100
feet away from the Hawass dig, and were able to go down more than 50 feet
without impediment before their drill-bit suddenly collided with some¬
thing hard and massive. After freeing the drill, much to their surprise, they
found that they had brought to the surface a large lump ofAswan granite."
No granite occurs naturally anywhere in the Nile Delta area where Giza
IS located, and Aswan - the source ofall the granite used by the ancients at
Giza - is located 500 miles to the south. The discovery of what appears to



The Case of the Psychic, the Scholar and the Sphinx 93
be a substantial granite obstacle — or perhaps several obstacles — 50 feet
below ground level in the vicinity of the Sphinx is therefore intriguing to
say the least.
Adding to the intrigue were further discoveries that the SRI made
around the Sphinx in 1982 as a result ofyet another project financed by the
Edgar Cayce Foundation.Mark Lehner, who was once again present
throughout, described what the SRI did as follows:
They brought a very powerful acoustical sounder, which is a long pencil¬
shaped thing. They put it down a drill hole. This is called Immersion
Downhole Acoustics. You have to be in water. So they put it down into the
water table and it sent out sound waves in all directions. Then they put down a
listener, like a stethoscope, and you get a signal on an oscilloscope if sound
waves are coming through; if they’re not, you don’t. You discover fissures this
way - on one side of the fissure there’s no signal and on the other side there is.
They put the sounder underneath the paw [of the Sphinx] and always got a
good, clear signal — there’s no underground cavity blocking it. And they put it
along the paw between the elbow and that box on the side, around the outside
of the box and into the corner, and there was always a good signal.
But, at my prompting, they put it on the bedrock floor inside the box - and
it was dead three places where they put it down, as though there is some kind of
opening or empty space underneath that was blocking the signal. That was the
very last day of the SRI project, and they never checked that out.^’
Since 1982, we were suprised to learn, almost no further research has been
officially authorized to investigate the numerous tantalizing hints of
deeply buried structures and chambers in the vicinity of the Sphinx. The
single exception was Thomas Dobecki’s seismic work in the early 1990s.
As reported in Part I, this resulted in the discovery of what appears to be a
large, rectangular chamber beneath the forepaws ofthe Sphinx. Dobecki’s
investigations were part of the wider geological survey of the Sphinx led
by Professor Robert Schoch ofBoston University - a survey, as the reader
will recall, that was brought abruptly to a halt in 1993 by Dr Zahi Hawass
of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization.
The mapping surveys
The American Research Center in Egypt (ARCE) has several times
received ECF-ARE financing for its programme of investigations at
Giza.^* In 1979, for example, a proposal was made to the ARCE for a full



94 Seekers
scale mapping survey involving the Great Sphinx and jts enclosure in
which use would be made of modem photogrammetric techniques to
record every detail, crack, fissure, contour and outline of the monument.
When the survey went ahead, Mark Lehner was appointed as its Field
Director. Funders were the Edgar Cayce Foundation, the Chase National
Bank of Egypt and the Franzhein Synergy group.
Mark Lehner completed the mapping survey in 1983 and by 1984 his
reputation was sealed as America’s leading expert on the Sphinx. He was
then appointed Director of the newly established and much more
extensive and ambitious Giza Mapping Project, again under the auspices
of the ARCE, and with some funding — again — coming from the Edgar
Cayce Foundation and ARE. The major financial contributors were the
Yale Endowment for Egyptology, General Dynamics, the multimillion¬
aire David Koch, and a Los Angeles real-estate tycoon named Bruce
Ludwig.'^ More recently the Giza Mapping Project has been superseded
by the Giza Plateau Project which also numbers David Koch and Bruce
Ludwig amongst its funders and which is also directed by Mark Lehner.'^'
Pulling away
When, exactly. Professor Lehner began to pull away from the influence of
the Edgar Cayce Foundation and cross over into the mainstream of
professional Egyptology and its orthodoxy is not especially clear.
However, some light may be shed on the matter by an interview that he
gave in August 1984 to Robert Smith, editor ofthe ARE magazine Venture
Inward. The interview was published in two parts in the January
February issues of 1985. Asked about his work at Giza, Lehner explained;
The history of my involvement began in 1972 when I went on an ARE tour.
We stopped in Egypt for a week and I went out to the Giza plateau with a
group, and then I went out to the Giza Pyramids again by myself and sat for
awhile in the King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid. I wandered around the
cemeteries that are outside the Pyramid, and something plugged into me about
this place. I vowed that I would be back in a year, and so I was. I went back to
study at the American University in Cairo. During that year before returning
to Cairo, I enthusiastically researched the Cayce readings on Egypt and put
together the book. The Egyptian Heritage. The readings describe not only a
civilization in Egypt m 10,500 BC, but also, preceding that, the lost civilization



The Case of the Psychic, the Scholar and the Sphinx 95
of Atlantis, which was in its final days, according to the Cayce information,
when the Sphinx and the Pyramids were built. .
Lehner then explained how he had come to realize that ‘there’s a great
disparity between the dating of the monuments by professional scholars
and that given in the Cayce readings’. He added that for him investigating
the Sphinx was ‘just a focus of a general metaphysical and spiritual quest’.
This had led him to work, he elaborated, ‘with the bedrock realities [and]
ground truth’ - realities that had made him bracket all his expectations and
ideas and ‘just deal with what the site has to offer’.'*^
In Venture Inward magazine of May-June 1986, Robert Smith
published an illuminating report about a meeting that took place at the
Edgar Cayce Foundation attended by Mark Lehner, Charles Thomas
Cayce (President of the ARE), James C. Windsor (President of the Edgar
Cayce Foundation), Edgar Evans Cayce, and other ARE officials. On the
agenda was the evaluation offuture ECF/ARE activities at Giza. Setbacks
and mounting scientific evidence against the Cayce prophesies had caused
some to question whether it was still worthwhile funding projects there.
Ironically, much of the adverse evidence was being turned up by Lehner’s
research.'^ Robert Smith recounts the discussion that took place:
‘What do we do next.?’ asked Edgar Evans Cayce, the younger son of Edgar
Cayce and a member of the Board of Trustees.
‘Should we drill more holes.?’ asked Charles Thomas Cayce, president of the
ARE, and grandson of Edgar Cayce.
Neither has given up the search for Ra-Ta. Lehner, the young archaeologist
who has led the search at Giza for the past decade, wants to press on with it too.
‘You are not as optimistic now about the prospects of vindicating some of
the things that were said about this area in the readings,’ noted James C.
Windsor, President ofthe Edgar Cayce Foundation. ‘Do you have any interest
in the Hall of Records.? Is it worth looking for.?’
‘Oh, absolutely,’ replied Lehner. ‘I think it is, but not in as tangible a way as
I used to think.’
Lehner went on to explain at length why various archaeological and
scientific tests had frustrated his hopes that the Cayce readings might be
linked to a suitably ‘tangible’ reality. ‘Why then continue the search?’
wondered Robert Smith.
‘I have a sort of gut feeling that something is under the Sphinx and that
something is out there at the pyramids in the way of a mystery,’ said
Lehner. ‘I like to think of it as something kind of pulsating.’ ^



96 Seekers
During the meeting at the Edgar Cayce Foundation, Charles Thomas
Cayce reportedly asked Lehner whether it would be possible to drill holes
at regular intervals in order to locate underground passages near the
Sphinx, but Lehner felt that the Egyptians would ‘balk’ at this idea. He
suggested in passing, however, that a certain American oil company
official, who at that time was apparently working for an American museum
might be interested in using his ‘crack geophysical prospecting team’ for
explorations beneath the Sphinx.'^’
Since making these statements and proposals — because, he says, ofwhat
the site has taught him - Lehner has veered further and further away from
the Edgar Cayce influence. Today he repudiates any notion of an earlier
civilisation in 10,500 bc. Indeed, so complete does his conversion appear
to have been that in a recent denunication of John West’s geological
theories concerning the Sphinx he felt compelled to state: ‘I believe we
have a professional responsibihty to respond to notions - hke those of
Cayce and West - that would rob the Egyptians of their own heritage by
assigning the origins and genius of Nile Valley civilization to some longlost agent hke Atlantis.’ ^
Lehner does not attempt to deny his own former involvement with the
Edgar Cayce Foundation, or with ideas about Atlantis, but seeks instead to
find ways to reconcile the origins of his former interests in ‘mystical
interpretations of the Pyramids and the Sphinx’ with his present hard¬
core commitment to ‘bedrock realities’. Lehner compares his situation to
that of Sir W. M. Fhnders Petrie, who had come to Egypt in the 1880s ‘to
test the mystical “pyramid inch” against the stone of Khufu’s pyramid’
and found the ‘pyramid inch’ wanting.'^’ Petrie, as we shall see in the next
chapter, had followed in the footsteps of his father, William, and the
notorious Astronomer Royal of Scotland, Piazzi Smyth - both of whom
passionately believed that the Great Pyramid had been built under divine
inspiration by the Israelites during their bondage in Egypt.’”
Lunch Avith Mr Cayce
In May 1994 we flew to New York and made our way by car to Virginia
Beach m Norfolk, Virginia, where the headquarters of the Edgar Cayce
Foundation, and its partner organization the Association for Research and
Enlightenment, are located. We wanted to explore the unexpected



The Case of the Psychic, the Scholar and the Sphinx 97
connections that this organization had at one time enjoyed with Mark
Lehner, and were curious to know how - if at all - the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization and Zahi Hawass, Lehner’s colleague at Giza,
fitted into all this.
Mutual friends arranged a meeting for us with the current President of
the ARE and the Edgar Cayce Foundation, Mr Charles Thomas Cayce,
the grandson of Edgar Cayce. We were also to meet two prominent ARE
members who, we were informed, had contributed to various projects at
Giza in the 1970s and 1980s and to the more recent geological
investigations carried out by John West and Robert Schoch.
The venue was the Edgar Cayce Foundation and ARE headquarters on
Atlantic Avenue. There we were greeted by cheerful and friendly staff. It
was a normal busy day and we saw visitors of all ages browsing in the well
stocked library and bookshop and making their way to various lectures and
meditation classes. The general atmosphere was a bit like that of the
campus of a small university or college.
We were taken for lunch by Mr Cayce at the nearby Ramada
Oceanfront Hotel. There we were joined by the two senior ARE members
who had come from New York and Washington to meet us. The
discussion at the table ranged widely and included what seemed to be a
completely open and honest review ofthe ARE’s various initiatives at Giza
over the previous two decades. Everyone seemed to know Mark Lehner
well, and both the man from Washington and the man from New York also
spoke of Zahi Hawass in extremely personal and friendly terms.
At this point we could not avoid bringing up the matter ofJohn West’s
recent sensational NBC television documentary. Mystery of the Sphinx
which, as we saw in Part I, Lehner had treated with disfavour and which
had also provoked the following vigorous rebuttal from Zahi Hawass:
The film indicates an attempt by these pretenders to prove that the age of the
Sphinx dates back to fifteen thousand years ., . [and that] the builders of the
Sphinx, and consequendy the Pyramids and other great antiquities, were not
the ancient Egyptians but other people of higher culture and education that
came from the ‘Adantis’ continent after its destruction and put beneath the
Sphinx the scientific records of the lost continent! It is evident that this John
West represents nothing but a continuation of the cultural invasion ofEgypt’s
civilization. Before him was Edgar Cayce in Virginia who pretended he lived
in Adantis fifteen thousand years ago and then fled to Egypt with the records
which he buried near the Sphinx before the destruction of the continent! . .



98 Seekers
Presented late in 1993 by the Hollywood actor Charlton Heston, Mystery
of the Sphinx had been partially financed by the ECF/ARE and their
supporters, and had very strongly endorsed the view that the Sphinx, and
a number of the other monuments on the Giza necropolis, must date back
to at least the eleventh millennium bc.” As we reported in Part I, it was this
same documentary that had also broken the news of Thomas Dobecki’s
seismic surveys around the Sphinx and his discovery ofa large rectangular
chamber buried deep in the bedrock beneath its front paws. This, of
course, had suggested to the ECF/ARE that there could be a connection
with Cayce’s ‘Hall of Records’. As Charlton Heston remarked in his
commentary: the unexpected cavity detected by the seismograph was
located precisely where Edgar Cayce said it would be - under the front
paws of the Sphinx.’
We asked Charles Cayce and his two colleagues how they felt about
Hawass’s angry and dismissive reaction to the film and his talk of ‘pretenders’.
The ARE men simply smiled and shrugged their shoulders. They were
very confident, they informed us, that everything was working for the
best: no matter what anybody said or did, the truth about Giza was going
to emerge and the Hall of Records’ was going to be discovered, just as
Edgar Cayce had prophesied.^'* On this note we parted company.
Correspondence
On 15 October 1995, Mark Lehner wrote us a five-page letter in response
to a draft of this chapter that we had asked him to review.** In the same
letter he informed us that he had recently resigned from Chicago
University’s Oriental Institute to ‘devote more time to research and
writing’. He also notified us that he intended to publish a book on ‘New
Age beliefs and Ancient Egypt’ which, he said, would expound, in greater
detail than we have done here, on his involvement with work funded by
the Edgar Cayce Foundation.*^
Our correspondence with Lehner was care of the Harvard Semitic
Museum m the state of Massachussets. As we write these words his
colleague in Egypt, Dr Zahi Hawass, is supervising the excavation of a
newly discovered ‘Old Kingdom’ temple complex with underground
tunnels immediately to the south-east of the Great Sphinx of Giza.*’



The Case of the Psychic, the Scholar and the Sphinx 99
Interviewed in December 1995 for a possible television documentary
concerning the mysteries of the Sphinx, Hawass led the film crew into a
tunnel beneath the Sphinx itself. ‘Really,’ he said, ‘even Indiana Jones will
never dream to be here. Can you believe it.? We are now inside the Sphinx
in this tunnel. This tunnel has been never opened before. No one really
knows what’s inside this tunnel. But we are going to open it for the first
time.’
postscript: Further correspondence with Mark Lehner, giving his
comments on this chapter, is reproduced on pages 290-97 as Appendix 3.



Chapter 6
The Case of the Iron Plate, the Freemasons,
the Relies and the Shafts
‘I am more than convinced of the . . .
existence of a passage and probably a
chamber (in the Great Pyramid) containing
possibly the records of the ancient
founders . .
John Dixon. Letter to Piazzi Smyth dated 25
November 1871, commenting on the
Queen’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid
‘Deep inside the Great Pyramid lies a dead
end [in the southern shaft of the Queen’s
Chamber]. Rudolf Gantenbrink could
explore beyond it, but no one will let him.’
Sunday Telegraph, London, i January 1995
Perhaps the most exotic researcher ever to have pronounced on the
mysteries of the Pyramids was Charles Piazzi Smyth, a nineteenth
century Astronomer Royal ofScotland. Like Edgar Cayce, he believed the
Great Pyramid to be somehow linked to Biblical prophecies concerning
the ‘Second Coming’ of Christ. And like Edgar Cayce, too, his name turns
up most unexpectedly in connection with recent remarkable discoveries at Giza.*
We will see why, later in this chapter. Meanwhile, as many readers will
recall from the international news coverage it received at the time, high
hopes were raised in March 1993 of a possible hidden chamber deep
within the Great Pyramid. Rudolf Gantenbrink, a Munich-based German
engineer, had used a tiny, hi-tech robot camera to explore the long narrow
shafts emanating from the northern and southern walls of the Queen’s
Chamber and, at the end of the southern shaft (the one targeted on the star



The Case of the Iron Plate, the Freemasons, the Relics and the Shafts lOI
Sirius) had discovered a small portcullis door complete with copper
handles. Immediately after the find was made. Dr Zahi Hawass enthused
to a German television team ‘in my opinion this is THE discovery in
Egypt’ and expressed the hope that ‘records’ on papyrus scrolls to do with
the ‘religion’ of the builders and maybe the ‘stars’, might be stashed away
behind the tantalizing door.^ Similar hopes were also raised in The Times of
London which, in addition, noted a curious link with Edgar Cayce and the
‘Hall of Records’:
SECRET PASSAGE POSES PYRAMID MYSTERY: In the 1940S Edgar Cayce, the
American clairvoyant, prophesied the discovery, in the last quarter ofthe 20th
century and somewhere near the Sphinx, of a hidden chamber containing the
historical records of Adantis. Whether recent discoveries in the Great
Pyramid of Cheops [Khufu] have an)Thing to do with that is far from certain,
but the discovery of a small door at the end of a long, hitherto unexplored, 8
inch square shaft has set many speculating about what, if anything, might lie
behind it. .
As we write these words, more than three years after Rudolf Gantenbrink
made his amazing discovery, no further exploration has been permitted
inside the southern shaft of the Queen’s Chamber and the mysterious
portcullis door remains unopened. During this period we note that Dr
Zahi Hawass (rather like his friend Mark Lehner over the issue of 10,500
Bc) has executed a radical volte-face. Gone are the eulogies and the great
expectations and he now asserts: ‘I think this is not a door and nothing is
behind it. .
Double standard
The story of the Great Pyramid’s shafts, and the oddly contradictory
Egyptological responses to whatever is discovered in them - or whatever
new ideas are proposed concerning them - goes back to the late 1830s
when the British explorer Colonel Howard Vyse ‘sat down before the
Great Pyramid as at a fortress to be besieged’. This comment, from one of
his contemporaries, alludes to Vyse’s renowned use of dynamite to
‘explore’ the Great Pyramid.^ It might have been more appropriate,
though less polite, to say that he confronted the last surviving wonder of
the ancient world as though it were a woman to be raped. Nevertheless, the
fact remains that during a hectic season of explorations and intrusive



102 Seekers
excavations (1836—7), Vyse and his team did manage to mal^e what looked
like two extremely important discoveries:
1 A section of flat iron plate, about one eighth of an inch thick, a foot
long and four inches wide, extracted from the masonry of the
southern face of the Pyramid at the exit point of the southern shaft of
the King’s Chamber (the shaft targeted on Orion’s belt).
2 ‘Quarry marks’ daubed inside the so-called relieving chambers above
the King’s Chamber. These hieroglyphs are the first and only
‘inscriptions’ ever found inside the Great Pyramid. They take the
form of loosely scrawled graffiti and include the name of Khufu, the
Fourth Dynasty Pharaoh whom Egyptologists suppose to have been
the builder of the monument.
The second find - the appearance of Khufu’s name — has been
repeatedly hailed by Egyptologists during the past 160 years as proof
positive that the otherwise anonymous Pyramid was indeed built by the
Pharaoh Khufu. The first — the iron plate — has been dismissed as a fraud
and the plate itself now lies in a narrow drawer in the British Museum, as
ignored and forgotten as the skull of Piltdown Man.^
Suppose, however, that the Egyptologists have got things the wrong way round.?
Suppose that it is the ‘quarry marks’ that are forged and the iron plate that is genuine.?
In this case the tidy and well-worked-out chronology ofthe evolution of
Egyptian society, which appears in all the standard textbooks, would be
shown to rest on frighteningly insecure foundations, the attribution of the
Great Pyramid to Khufu would revert to undocumented speculation, and
the orthodox date of the Iron Age in Egypt - placed by Egyptologists as
being not earlier than 650 Bc' - would have to be pushed back almost 2000 years.
We have argued elsewhere, and at length, that the quarry marks inside
the Great Pyramid could have been forged - and specifically that Howard'
Vyse, who had spent £ 10,000 on his 1836-7 excavations (a princely sum in
those days) had both the motive and the opportunity to forge them * Briefly:
I It is notable that the marks were only discovered in the four ‘relieving
chambers’ opened by Vyse himself, and not in the chamber
immediately below these (and immediately above the ceiling of the



The Case of the Iron Plate, the Freemasons, the Relics and the Shafts 103
King’s Chamber) which had been opened by a previous explorer,
Nathaniel Davison, in 1765. It is also notable that Vyse’s diary entry
for the day on which he first opened and accessed the lowest of ‘his’
four chambers (i.e. the one above Davison’s Chamber) reports a
thorough examination but makes no mention whatsoever of any
hieroglyphs prominently daubed on the walls in red paint. On the
very next day, however, when Vyse returned to the chamber with
witnesses, the hieroglyphs were suddenly there - almost as though
they had been painted overnight.’
2 As one of Vyse’s critics has perceptively pointed out, ‘the perspective
and angles at which the inscriptions were made shows that they were
painted not by the quarry masons before the blocks were moved, but
rather by someone working in the cramped quarters of the [relieving]
chambers after the blocks had been placed in the Pyramid.
Instructions for locating blocks in a construction project [which is
what the quarry marks purport to be] serve no purpose after the fact
has been accomplished. Clearly they were added by someone else and
not by the builders themselves.’
3 There are horrendous ‘orthographic’ problems with the hieroglyphs.
These problems were first pointed out in the nineteenth century by
Samuel Birch, a British Museum expert on the ancient Egyptian
language. Although nobody either then or now has paid any attention
to his comments, he made the important observation that the styles of
writing expressed in the ‘quarry marks’ are a strange anomalistic
hotchpotch of different eras. Some of the cursive forms and titles
used in these supposedly Fourth Dynasty inscriptions are found
nowhere else in Egypt until the Middle Kingdom, about 1000 years
later (when they become plentiful). Others are unknown until the
Twenty-sixth Dynasty (664-525 bc). Perhaps most telling of all,
however, is the use of certain words and phrases in a completely
unique and zany way that occurs nowhere else in the entire sprawling
corpus of writings that has come down to us from ancient Egyptian
times. To give an example, the hieroglyph for ‘good, gracious’
appears where the number 18 is meant.”
4 There are difficulties with the name Khufu itself as it is given in the
quarry marks. It contains a mistake (a dot surrounded by a circle
instead of a simple filled-in circle) that - like the usage of the ‘good.



104 Seekers
gracious’ hieroglyph — is repeated on no other ancient Egyptian
inscription. Interestingly, however, this same mistake in the writing
out of the name Khufu occurs in the only two source books on
hieroglyphs that would have been available to Vyse in 1837: Leon de
Laborde’s Vjyage de VArabic Petree and Sir John Gardner
Wilkinson’s Materia HieroglyphicaP
5 Last but not least, even if the quarry marks were not forged by Vyse,
what do they really prove.? Isn’t attributing the Great Pyramid to
Khufu on the basis of a few lines of graffiti a bit like handing over the
keys of the Empire State building to a man named ‘Kilroy’ just
because his name was found spray-painted on the walls of the lift.?
We are frankly puzzled that such questions are never asked-and, in
general, that Egyptologists are so ready to accept the quarry marks as
proof ofKhufu’s ownership ofthe Pyramid. Their own credulity on such
matters is of course their business. Nevertheless we think that it verges on
intellectual chicanery for the same dubious attribution to be regurgitated
again and again, in all the standard texts, without any cautionary notes
about the many problems, anachronisms and inconsistencies that cast
doubt on the authenticity and significance of Vyse’s ‘discovery’.*^
Strangely, however, his other ‘discovery’, which Egyptologists today
unhesitatingly write off as a forgery, gives every indication of being
genuine - and highly significant. This was the discovery ofa flat iron plate
embedded in the masonry of the Pyramid’s southern face.
The iron plate affair
As we have seen, the two main chambers in the superstructure ofthe Great
Pyramid - the King’s Chamber and the Queen’s Chamber - are each
equipped with two long, narrow shafts which bore deep into the solid
masonry, one directed northward and the other to the south. Those
emanating from the King’s Chamber cut right through to the outside.
Those emanating from the Queen’s Chamber stop somewhere within the core of the monument.
The existence of the King’s Chamber shafts was first recorded by Dr
John Greaves, a British astronomer, in 1636. It was not until 1837,
however, that they were investigated thoroughly - by Colonel Howard
Vyse with the assistance of two civil engineers, John Perring and James



The Case of the Iron Plate, the Freemasons, the Relics and the Shafts 105
Mash. Another member of Vyse’s team was Mr J. R. Hill, an obscure
Englishman living in Cairo, who in May of 1837 was put in charge of
clearing the mouth of the southern shaft (which emerges at the 102nd
course ofmasonry on the south face ofthe Pyramid). In accord with Vyse’s
methods elsewhere. Hill was instructed to use explosives and was thus
responsible for the ugly vertical scar which may be seen to this day running
up the centre of the south side of the Great Pyramid.
On Friday, 26 May 1837, after a couple of days ofblasting and clearing.
Hill discovered the flat iron plate mentioned above. Vyse was soon
afterwards to trumpet it in his monumental opus. Operations Carried on at
the Pyramids of Gizeh as ‘the oldest piece of wrought iron known’,but
Hill at the time was content to write up the discovery in the proper, sober
manner:
This is to certify that the piece of iron found by me near the mouth of the air
passage [shaft], in the southern side ofthe Great Pyramid at Gizeh, on Friday,
May 26th, was taken out by me from an inner joint, after having removed by
blasting the two outer tiers ofthe stones of the present surface of the Pyramid;
and that no joint or opening of any sort-was connected with the above
mentioned joint, by which the iron could have been placed in it after the
original building of the Pyramid. I also shewed the exact spot to Mr. Perring,
on Saturday, June 24th.
John Perring, a civil engineer, thus examined the exact spot of the find.
With him was James Mash, also a civil engineer, and both were ‘of the
opinion that the iron must have been left in the joint during the building of
the Pyramid, and that it could not have been inserted afterwards’.*^
Ultimately Vyse sent the mysterious artefact, together with the certifica¬
tions of Hill, Perring and Mash, to the British Museum. There, from the
outset, the general feeling was that it could not be a genuine piece, because
wrought iron was unknown in the Pyramid Age, and that it must therefore
have been ‘introduced’ in much more recent times.
In 1881 the plate was re-examined by Sir W. M. Flinders Petrie who
found it difficult, for a variety ofcogent reasons, to agree with this analysis:
Though some doubt has been thrown on the piece, merely from its rarity, [he
noted] yet the vouchers for it are very precise; and it has a cast of a nummulite
[fossilized marine protozoa] on the rust ofit, proving it to have been buried for
ages beside a block of nummulitic limestone, and therefore to be certainly
ancient. No reasonable doubt can therefore exist about its being a really
genuine piece . . P

Despite this forceful opinion from one of the oddball giants ofEgyptology
in the late Victorian Age, the profession as a whole has been unable to cope
with the idea of a piece of wrought iron being contemporary with the
Great Pyramid. Such a notion goes completely against the grain of every
preconception that Egyptologists internalize throughout their careers
concerning the ways in which civilizations evolve and develop.
Scientific analysis
Because of these preoccupations, no further investigations of any
significance were undertaken into the iron plate for another i o8 years and
It was not until 1989 that a fragment from it was at last subjected to
rigorous optical and chemical tests. The scientists responsible for the work
were Dr M. P. Jones, Senior Tutor in the Mineral Resources Engineering
Department at Imperial College, London, and his colleague Dr Sayed El
Gayer, a lecturer in the Faculty ofPetroleum and Mining at Egypt’s Suez
University, who gained his Ph.D. in extraction metallurgy at the
University of Aston in Birmingham.'*
They began their study by checking on the nickel content of the iron
plate. Their reason for doing this was to exclude the faint possibility that it
might have been manufactured from meteoritic iron (i.e. iron from fallen
meteorites - a material that is known, very rarely, to have been used during
the Pyramid Age). Ready-made meteoritic iron of this sort, however, is
always extremely easy to identify because it invariably contains a
significant proportion ofnickel - typically seven per cent or more.On the
basis oftheir first testJones and El Gayer noted; ‘The iron plate from Giza
is clearly not of meteoritic origin, since it contains only a trace of nickel.’
The metal, therefore, was man-made. But how had it been made.?
Further tests proved that it had been smelted at a temperature between
1000 and 1100 degrees centigrade. These tests also picked up the odd fact
that there were ‘traces of gold on one face of the iron plate’.'" Perhaps,
Jones and El Gayer speculated, it might originally have been ‘gold-plated’
and this gold may be an indication that this artefact... was held in great esteem when it was produced’."
Finally, when was it produced.?
After completing an extremely careful and detailed study, the two
metallurgists reported as follows: ‘It is concluded, on the basis of the



The Case of the Iron Plate, the Freemasons, the Relics and the Shafts 107
present investigation, that the iron plate is very ancient. Furthermore, the
metallurgical evidence supports the archaeological evidence which
suggests that the plate was incorporated within the Pyramid at the time
that structure was being built.’
When Jones and El Gayer submitted their findings to the British
Museum, they were in for quite a surprise. Instead of being excited,
officials fobbed them off: ‘The structure of the iron plate is unusual,’
conceded Paul Craddock and Janet Lang. ‘We are not sure of the
significance or origin of this structure but it is not necessarily indicative of
great age.’
The British Museum’s view
Because the iron plate appeared to have been removed originally from
within or near the mouth of the King’s Chamber’s ‘Orion’ shaft it was of
great interest to us. We decided to take a look at it. Through Dr A. J.
Spencer, Assistant Curator of the Egyptian Antiquities Department at the
British Museum, we arranged a viewing on 7 November 1993. We were
permitted to handle the plate and were intrigued by its unusual weight and
texture. We could also hardly fail to notice that under its surface patina the
internal metal possessed a brilliant shine - which was revealed at the point
where the fragment had been cleanly sliced off for El Gayer’s and Jones’s
analysis. Dr Spencer repeated thp British Museum’s official line - that the
plate was not old but had been introduced, probably deliberately, in Vyse’s
time - and that El Gayer and Jones’s conclusions were ‘highly dubious’.^'^
How and why could the conclusions of such eminent metallurgists be
deemed ‘highly dubious’, we asked.^
Dr Spencer had no answer and Dr Craddock, whom we spoke to on the
phone, did not wish to elaborate.
A few days later we called Dr M. P. Jones and heard from him how he
and Dr El Gayer had examined the plate in the laboratories at Imperial
College London in 1989. Dr Jones is now retired and lives in Wales. When
we asked him what he thought of the British Museum’s view of his
conclusions he was, understandably, rather irritated. He insisted that the
iron plate was ‘very old’ and, like us, he felt - since there were two
opposing views - that the best way to resolve this matter would be further
testing in an independent laboratory.

After all, the implications ofman-made iron in 2500 BC are tremendous.
And this isn’t just a matter ofredating the so-called Iron Age. Perhaps in a
way more intriguing are the questions raised as to thefunction that an iron
plate might have had, inside the southern shaft ofthe main chamber in the
Great Pyramid, many thousands of years ago. Could there be a
relationship between this plate and the stone portculhs door with copper
handles that RudolfGantenbrink had so recently discovered at the end of
the southern shaft of the Queen’s Chamber - a shaft directed to ‘Sirius
Isis’, the consort of‘Orion-Osiris’.?
In their 1989 report, El Gayer and Jones noted that the plate was
probably a fragment coming from a larger piece which might originally
have composed a square plate that would have fitted, like a sort of‘gate’, neatly over the mouth of the shaft.
Stargate
In later chapters we will make detailed reference to the so-called ‘Pyramid
Texts’ of ancient Egypt. These texts take the form of extensive funerary
and rebirth inscriptions carved on the tomb walls of certain Fifth- and
Sixth-Dynasty pyramids at Saqqara, about ten miles south of Giza.
Egyptologists agree that much if not all of the content of the inscriptions
predates the Pyramid Age.^^ It is thus unsettling to discover in these
ancient scriptures, supposedly the work of neolithic farmers who had
hardly even begun to master copper, that there are abundant references to iron.
The name given to it is Bja - ‘the divine metal’ - and we always
encounter it in distinctive contexts related in one way or another to
astronomy, to the stars and to the gods.^^ For example B'ja is frequently
mentioned in the texts in connection with the ‘four sons of Horus’
presumably related in some way to strange beings called the Shemsu Hor
the ‘Followers of Horus’ and ‘Transfigured Ones’, whom we shall also be
^scussing m later chapters. At any rate, these very mysterious ‘sons of
Horus seem to have been made of iron or to have had iron fingers: ‘Your
^ildren’s children together have raised you up, namely [the four sons of
Horus] . . . your mouth is split open with their iron fingers . . .’ ^’
Iron is also mentioned in the texts as being necessary for the
construction of a bizarre instrument called a Meshtyrp. Very much



The Case of the Iron Plate, the Freemasons, the Relics and the Shafts 109
resembling a carpenter’s adze or cutting tool, this was a ceremonial device
which was used to ‘strike open the mouth’ of the deceased Pharaoh’s
mummified and embalmed corpse — an indispensable ritual if the
Pharaoh’s soul were to be re-awakened to eternal life amidst the cycles of
the stars.
In the Pyramid Texts we thus find a high priest making this cryptic
statement:
Your mouth is in good order for I split open your mouth for you . . . O king, I
open your mouth for you with the adze of iron of Upuaut, I split open your
mouth for you with the adze of iron which split open the mouths of the gods
. . . Horus has split open the mouth of this king with that wherewith he split
open the mouth of his father, with that wherewith he split open the mouth of Osiris . .
From such utterances, and many more like them, it is clear that iron was
somehow seen by the composers ofthe Pyramid Texts as being imperative
in the rituals aimed at ensuring new life - cosmic and stellar life - to the
dead king. More importantly the above verse also connects the metal and
its uses to the ancient prototype ofall such rituals by means ofwhich Osiris
himself, Egypt’s ‘Once and Future King’, died and was then restored to
immortal life as Lord of the sky-region of Orion. This region, as we shall
see in Part III, was known as the Duat. In it all the Pharaohs of Egypt
hoped that they would reside eternally after their own deaths:
The gate of the earth is open for you . . . may a stairway to the Duat be set up
for you to the place where Orion is . .
O king. . . the sky conceives you with Orion . . . the sky has borne you with
Orion . .
O king, be a soul like a living star . .
The gate of the earth-god is open . . . may you remove yourself to the sky
and sit upon your iron throne . .
The aperture of the sky window is opened for you . .
The doors of iron which are in the starry sky are thrown open for me, and I
go through them . .
What seems to be envisaged here, taken literally and reduced to the basic
common denominators running through all the above utterances, appears
to be nothing less than an iron ‘stargate’ intended to admit Osiris, and all
the dynasties of dead kings after him, into the celestial realms ofthe belt of
Orion. But ifthe Pyramid Texts are describing a stargate then they are also
describing a timegate - for they express no doubt that by passing through



no Seekers
the iron-doored portals of the sky the soul of the deceased,will attain a life
of millions of years, navigating eternity in the vessels of the gods.
Naturally, therefore, by virtue of its original position at or near the end of
the southern shaft of the King’s Chamber, we are tempted to wonder
whether the neglected iron plate in the British Museum might have been
connected with such amazingly sophisticated concepts and beliefs about
immortahty and about the ability of ^the equipped spirit’ to gain a
complete mastery over death and time.
We wonder, too, what might have been the function ofother mysterious
objects that were discovered in the shafts of the Queen’s Chamber when
these were first opened in 1872 by Waynman Dixon, an enterprising
engineer from Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
Unknown dark distance
Unlike the King’s Chamber shafts, those in the Queen’s Chamber (a) do
not exit on the outside of the monument and (b) were not originally cut
through the chamber’s limestone walls. Instead the builders left the last
five inches intact in the last block over the mouth of each of the shafts
thus rendering them invisible and inaccessible to any casual intruder.
The reader will recall the mention of Charles Piazzi Smyth and his
prophetic theories about the Great Pyramid at the start of this chapter. In
the early 1860s, when he was formulating these theories, he befriended a
certain William Petrie, an engineer, whose son, W. M. Flinders Petrie,
was later to be universally acclaimed as the founder of the academic
discipline of Egyptology.
William Petrie was amongst the first ‘Pyramidologists’ of the Victorian
Age to give strong support to Piazzi Smyth’s notion that the Great
Pyramid might be some sort of prophetic monument to Mankind
encoding a Messianic blueprint designed to serve as an advance-warning
mechanism for the ‘Second Coming’ of Christ.^*^ ‘There had been a time’,
wrote Professor Hermann Bruck and Dr Mary Bruck in their authoritative
biography of the Astronomer Royal, ‘when Flinders Petrie and his father
had wholeheartedly concurred with most of Piazzi Smyth’s ideas.’”
Indeed as these two eminent astronomers and authors point out, the young
Flinders Petrie set out to Egypt in 1880 on his famous study of the Great



The Case of the Iron Plate, the Freemasons, the Relics and the Shafts III
Pyramid precisely because he wanted to ‘continue Piazzi Smyth’s work’.^®
Returning now to the shafts in the Queen’s Chamber, we were
interested to learn that their discoverer, the engineer Waynman Dixon
together with his brother John - had also maintained very close ties with
Piazzi Smyth. Indeed, it had been through the Astronomer Royal’s direct
influence that the Dixons were able to explore the Great Pyramid in 1872
and discover the previously concealed entrances to the northern and
southern star-shafts in the Queen’s Chamber.^’
Waynman Dixon’s curiosity had been aroused by the shafts in the
King’s Chamber which provoked him to look for similar features in the
Queen’s Chamber. This search, which took place some time early in 1872,
was undertaken with the full knowledge of Piazzi Smyth, who later
described the whole matter in his book. The story goes that after noticing a
crack in the southern wall of the Queen’s Chamber — roughly where he
thought that he might find shafts - Waynman Dixon set his ‘carpenter and
man-of-all-work’, a certain Bill Grundy ‘to jump a hole with a hammer
and steel chisel at that place. So to work the faithful fellow went, and with a
will which soon began to make a way into the soft stone at this point when
lo! after a comparatively very few strokes, flop went the chisel right
through into something or other.’ ^
The ‘something or other’ Bill Grundy’s chisel had reached turned out
to be ‘a rectangular, horizontal, tubular channel, about 9 inches by 8 inches
in transverse breadth and height, going back 7 feet into the wall, and then
rising at an angle into an unknown dark distance . .
This was the southern shaft.
Next, measuring off a similar position on the north wall, Waynman
Dixon ‘set the invaluable Bill Grundy to work there with his hammer and
steel chisel; and again, after a very little labour, flop went the said chisel
through into somewhere; which somewhere was presently found to be a
horizontal pipe or channel of transverse proportions like the other, and, at
a distance within the masonry of 7 feet, rising at a similar angle, but in the
opposite direction, and trending indefinitely far . .
Together with his brother John, Waynman Dixon made efforts to
probe both the northern and southern shafts - using a jointed rod,
something like a chimney-sweep’s rod, for this purpose.'*^ Late-nine
teenth-century technology was not up to the job and a segment of the rod



33- Detail of Queen’s Chamber shaft.
became wedged in the northern shaft, where it still remains.'^ Before this
happened, however, the Dixons found three small relics in the shafts.
These objects - a rough stone sphere, a small two-pronged hook made
out of some form of metal, and a fine piece of cedar wood some 12
centimetres long with strange notches cut into it'^^ - were exported from
Egypt m the summer of 1872 and arrived safely in England a few weeks
later.*^ During the next year or so they were commented upon in books,
and even illustrated in scientific and popular magazines such as Nature and
the London Graphic.Before the turn of the century, however, they had disappeared.'^*

A curious series of links exists involving all of the following:
• the discovery of the Queen’s Chamber shafts with their constituent
relics;
• the formation of the Egyptian Exploration Society (the EES, British
Egyptology’s most prestigious organization);
• the foundation, at University College, London, of Egyptology’s most
prestigious Chair;
• British Freemasonry.
In 1872, whilst the Dixon brothers were exploring the Great Pyramid, a
well-known Freemason and parliamentarian. Sir James Alexander,
proposed a motion to bring to Britain the incorrectly named ‘Cleopatra’s
Needle’ — a 200-ton obehsk ofPharaoh Thutmosis III which had originally
been erected some 3500 years ago in the sacred city of Heliopolis.'^’
Funding for the project came from the personal fortune of another
Freemason, the eminent British dermatologist. Sir Erasmus Wilson,^® and
Sir James Alexander recommended that the civil engineer John Dixon
also a Freemason — should be engaged to collect the obelisk from Egypt.
On this basis Sir Erasmus Wilson promptly recruited John Dixon - and
also his brother, Waynman, who was then living in Egypt.’'
A few years later the same Erasmus Wilson was responsible for the
creation of the Egyptian Exploration Society (the EES) and served as its
first president.’^ Then in 1883, Wilson and the Victorian author Amelia
Edwards co-founded the important Chair in Egyptology at University
College London - and it was through Wilson’s personal recommendation
that the young Flinders Petrie became the first scholar to occupy it.”
Perhaps all such connections are nothing more than quaint coinciden¬
ces. If so, then it is probably also a coincidence that in the seventeenth
century the founder ofthe Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, one ofthe most
prestigious of today’s Egyptological research centres (which holds the
coveted ‘Petrie Chair’), was none other than Elias Ashmole- the first man
ever, according to Masonic historians, to be openly initiated on British soil
into the hitherto secret society of Freemasonry.”
We have no evidence that the Brotherhood is still a significant influence
in Egyptology today. Our researches into the pedigree of this insular
discipline, however, did, in a rather oblique way, lead to the rediscovery of
two of the three missing ‘Dixon’ relics.

The British Museum and the missing cigar box
These three items are the only relics ever to have beenfound inside the Great
Pyramid. Moreover the place in which they were found, i.e. the star-shafts
of the Queen s Chamber, links them directly to one of the key aspects of
our own research. In the summer of 1993, therefore, 121 years after they
had been discovered, we resolved to try to find out what had happened to them.
Going back through press reports, and the private diaries of the figures
involved, we found out that John and Waynman Dixon had brought the
relics to England in a cigar box. We also learned, as noted earher, that the
Dixons had been involved in bringing to England Cleopatra’s Needle. The
obelisk was erected on the Thames Embankment, where it stands to this
day. John Dixon was at the inauguration ceremony and was on record as
having buried ‘a large cigar box, contents unknown’ beneath the pedestal of the monument.
The logic looked persuasive. John Dixon brought the relics to England
in a cigar box. Johp Dixon brought Cleopatra’s Needle to England. And
John Dixon buried a cigar box beneath Cleopatra’s Needle. Around that
time the relics disappeared. The strong Masonic link in this affair called to
mind a well-known practice in operative and speculative Freemasonry
which involves certain rituals when placing the corner-stones of Masonic
monuments and edifices. This practice suggested the possibihty that the
relics from the Great Pyramid could have been hidden under Cleopatra’s
Needle along with the other Masonic paraphernalia and memorabilia known to have been installed there. “
At any rate, the relics did genuinely seem to have disappeared and the
experts whom we consulted at the British Museum said they had no idea
where they could have gone to. We also consulted Professor I. E. S.
Edwards, the Museum’s former Keeper of Egyptian Antiquities
(1954-74) and a former vice-president of the EES. Edwards is Britain’s
foremost authority on Giza and the author of a definitive text. The
Pyramids ofEgypt, first published in 1946 and reprinted virtually every
year since then. In all editions ofthis book we found that he had mentioned
Waynman Dixon and reported how the shafts in the Queen’s Chamber
were discovered, but had made absolutely no reference to the relics. This,
he told us, was because he had no recollection of them and therefore, of
course, no idea concerning what their ultimate fate might have been. ’



Above: The Great Sphinx of Giza, as this nineteenth-century photograph shows, has spent a large part of its known history covered up to its neck in desert sands. Whilst thus covered, its body has not been subject to wind-erosion, yet the body is heavily weathered. Could there have been some other weathering agency at work? Below: The Sphinx was carved by first excavating a large trench around a monolithic central core of limestone which was then shaped into the form of a lion. This photograph, taken from the Great Pyramid, shows the Sphinx in its trench, the remains of the so-called Sphinx Temple (immediately in front, i.e. to the east, of the monument) and Valley Temple (a little to the south). Also shown, running down the south side of the Sphinx, is part of the gigantic causeway of Khafre.



Above: Heavily eroded core body of the Sphinx. The weathering patterns, which have been studied by geologists from Boston University, have been identified as having been caused by prolonged exposure to heavy rains. In 2500 bc, when Egyptologists presume that the Sphinx was built, Egypt was as bone dry as it is today. Between 15,000 bc and 7000 BC, however, the science of palaeo-climatology indicates that Egypt several times passed through periods of wet climate which could have caused weathering patterns such as these. Left: The trench surrounding the Great Sphinx, which was created at the same time that the Sphinx was carved, very clearly illustrates the rolling scalloped ‘coves’ and deep vertical fissures characteristic of
precipitation-induced weathering in limestone. The sciences of geology and palaeoclimatology alone, however, can only demonstrate that the Sphinx and its enclosure are much older than previously thought. Archaeo-astronomical analysis provides a far more accurate tool for dating the Sphinx. Right: This granite stela between the paws of the Sphinx was erected to commemorate a renovation campaign carried out by Pharaoh Thuthmosis IV (1401 BC-1391 bc). The stela bears the single syllable ‘Khaf’ which, oddly, has led Egyptologists to conclude that the Sphinx was originally built by the Fourth Dynasty Pharaoh Khafre, circa 2500 bc. The stela also states, however, that the Giza
necropolis is the ‘Splendid Place of the First Time’ - associating it with a far earlier epoch.

Like ourselves, however. Professor Edwards knew of the link between
Flinders Petrie, Piazzi Smyth and the Dixons, and knew that Petrie’s
exploration of the Great Pyramid had immediately followed that of the
Dixons.
Oddly enough, Petrie, too, makes no mention of the relics in his own
famous book Pyramids and Temples ofGizeh — though he does speak of the
Dixons and the shafts. But could he have referred to them elsewhere in his
voluminous publications.'* Edwards suggested that we ask Petrie’s
biographer, the Egyptologist Mrs Margaret Hackford-Jones, to research
the matter in Petrie’s diaries and private papers. If he had made any
mention of the Dixon relics then she would definitely be able to find it. But
a thorough search by Mrs Hackford-Jones brought no results.”
In the absence of viable alternatives, therefore, we wondered whether it
might not be worth looking to see whether the three curious objects might
not still be in Dixon’s cigar box underneath Cleopatra’s Needle.
The story was picked up by the Independent^ a British national
newspaper, on 6 December 1993. Interviewed in the report, Professor
Edwards stated categorically that neither he nor anyone else he knew had
heard of these relics before.** We were therefore taken by surprise on 13
December 1993 — only a week after the article containing Edwards’s quote
was published — when Dr Vivian Davies, the Keeper of Egyptian
Antiquities at the British Museum, casually announced in a letter to the
Independent that the relics, still in the cigar box, were in his Department’s
keep.”
So why had his Department not admitted to having them before?
‘I think there has been a lot of misunderstanding about this whole
business,’ soothed a Museum PR spokesman a few days later. ‘We didn’t
say we did not have them, we said we were not aware of having them.’ “
After doing some more digging we discovered what had happened. The
relics (or rather two of them because the only carbon-datable item, the
piece ofwood, was missing) had not been placed under Cleopatra’s Needle
as we had at first conjectured. Instead they had remained in the hands of
the Dixon family for exactly a hundred years. Then, in 1972, Dixon’s
great-granddaughter had taken them along to the British Museum and
had generously donated them to the Egyptian Antiquities Department.
Their receipt was recorded in the meticulous hand ofthe Keeper himself
Dr I. E. S. Edwards.** Thereafter the relics seemed simply to have been



ii6 Seekers
forgotten and only resurfaced in December 1993 because an Egyptologist
named Dr Peter Shore happened to read the Independenfs story about our
search for them. Now retired in Liverpool, Shore had been Edwards’s
assistant in 1972. He remembered the arrival of the relics at the British
Museum and now promptly notified the relevant authorities that they had
a potentially embarrassing incident on their hands.
We naturally wondered how it was possible that mysterious relics
recovered from unexplored shafts inside the Great Pyramid of Egypt
could have been treated with such indifference by professional Egyptolo¬
gists. To be completely honest we found it very difficult to accept that they
really could just have been forgotten for twenty-one years by the British
Museum’s Egyptian Antiquities Department. What we could not
understand at all, however, was how they could have stayed forgotten
during most of 1993 after a robot had explored the very same shafts and
found a much pubhcized closed ‘door’ deep within one of them. Indeed
more than two weeks before the article in the Independent came out, Rudolf
Gantenbrink, the discoverer ofthe ‘door’, had visited London and given a
full lecture at the British Museum to a large group of Egyptologists
including Professor Edwards, Dr Vivian Davies and many others who
knew ofour search for the ‘Dixon’ relics. During the lecture, Gantenbrink
showed and explained detailed video footage, taken by his robot, of the
interior of the Queen’s Chamber shafts - i.e. the shafts in which the rehcs
had been found. As well as the ‘door’ at the end of the southern shaft, the
footage also clearly showed, still lying on the floor ofthe northern shaft’ but
at higher levels than the Dixons had been able to reach, at least two distinct
objects — a metallic hook, and an apparent baton of wood.^^
In the next chapter we shaU take a look at Gantenbrink’s exploration,
and at the events that led up to and followed it.



Chapter 7
The Case ofthe Robot, the Germans and the
Door
'Upuaut, a wolf deity ... He was chiefly
revered for his role as Opener of the Ways to
the Underworld, showing the dead souls the
path through that dark realm .. .’
Veronica Ions, Egyptian Mythology, 1982
The introduction ofa robot-camera into the narrow mouth ofthe southern
shaft of the Queen’s Chamber in March 1993, and the subsequent
spectacular discovery ofa closed portcullis ‘door’ 200 feet along that shaft,
are not events that occurred in a vacuum. On the contrary, although
mainstream Egyptologists profess little interest in the Queen’s Chamber
(which they generally regard as an ‘unfinished’, ‘abandoned’ and
unimportant feature of the Great Pyramid), quite a lot of activity had
taken place around it during the previous decade.
In 1986, for example, two French architects, Gilles Dormion and Jean
Patrice Goidin, somehow managed to obtain a scientific licence to conduct
a spectacular exploration inside the Great Pyramid. Dormion and Goidin
had persuaded certain senior officials at the Egyptian Antiquities
Organization that a ‘hidden chamber’ could lie behind the west wall of the
horizontal corridor leading to the Queen’s Chamber. In a rare move, the
EAO gave permission for the drilling of a series of small holes to test the
theory. Apparently some evidence was found of a large ‘cavity’ which was
filled with unusually fine sand - nothing more - but this was enough to
send the world media into a frenzy and to turn Dormion and Goidin into
hot media properties for a while. Egyptologists fumed on the quiet. The
project was eventually stopped and Dormion and Goidin were never to
resume their work in the Great Pyramid.'
The same thing happened again in 1988 when aJapanese scientific team



ii8 Seekers
from Waseda University took up the challenge. They were led by
Professor Sakuji Yoshimura. This time the Japanese used ‘non-destruc¬
tive techniques’ based on a high-tech system ofelectromagnetic waves and
radar equipment. They, too, detected the existence of a ‘cavity’ off the
Queen’s Chamber passageway, some three metres under the floor and, as it
turned out, very close to where the French had drilled. They also detected
a large cavity behind the north-west wall of the Queen’s Chamber itself,
and a ‘tunnel’ outside and to the south of the Pyramid which appeared to
run underneath the monument. Before any further exploration or drilling
could be done, the Egyptian authorities intervened and halted the project.
Yoshimura and his team were never to return to complete their work in the
Queen’s Chamber.^
It seems odd, despite all the buzz concerning hidden chambers in the
vicinity of the Queen’s Chamber, that nobody should have taken a closer
look into the Queen’s Chamber’s mysterious and hitherto unexplored
shafts. Disappearing as they do, one northwards and the other south¬
wards, into the bowels of the monument, one would have thought that
somebody would have had the gumption to investigate them (using video¬
camera reconnaissance instead of all these unsatisfactory and inconclusive
drillings and radar scanning probes). Indeed, as we have argued elsewhere,
there is much about their construction and design that could almost have
been deliberately contrived to stimulate and invite such investigations.^
Throughout the 1980s, however, the consensus of senior Egyptologists
was that the shafts, like the Queen’s Chamber itself, were ‘abandoned’
features of the Great Pyramid. No doubt it was the power of this
consensus, and the built-in reluctance to challenge it, that discouraged
individual Egyptologists from interesting themselves in the shafts. After
all, what would be the point ofexploring obscure parts of the Pyramid that
everyone knew had been ‘abandoned’ during construction.
As a non-Egyptologist, the German robotics engineer Rudolf Ganten
brink did not suffer from such inhibitions. Early in 1991 he submitted a
proposal for the videoscopic examination of the shafts to the German
Archaeological Institute in Cairo.
Planning an adventure
Gantenbrink s story, as he reported it to us in many hours of documented



The Case of the Robot, the Germans and the Door 119
conversations, goes back to August 1990 when the Egyptian Antiquities
Organization commissioned the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo
to install a ventilation system inside the Great Pyramid. This project
would mainly involve the ‘cleaning’ of the two shafts of the King’s
Chamber which (unlike those in the Queen’s Chamber) emerge on the
outside faces ofthe pyramid and thus could be ofsome conceivable use for
ventilation. After cleaning, powerful electric fans would be installed in
their mouths to boost the natural air-flow through them.
A few months after accepting the EAO’s commission for the ventilation
project Rainer Stadelmann, the Director of the German Archaeological
Institute, received Rudolf Gantenbrink’s proposal for the exploration of
the Queen’s Chamber shafts using a high-tech miniature robot. This
proposal, a copy of which Gantenbrink has kindly supplied to us, is
entitled Videoscopische Untersuchung der sog. Luftkanale der Cheopspyra
mide (Videoscopic Investigation ofthe so-called Air Shafts in the Pyramid
of Cheops).'*
The proposal outlines Gantenbrink’s plans to build a special robot
equipped with two powerful lamps and a ‘CCD Farbvideokamera’ with a
special fixed-focus lens giving a full 90-degrees angle of vision. The
specifications of the robot would include a powerful electric motor in
order for it to be able to tackle the steep slopes of the shafts. The video
camera and the motor would be controlled from a console and monitor
unit stationed inside the chamber and linked to the robot by electric cables.
Caterpillar tracks would be fixed above and below the robot’s chassis and
adjusted with two sets of powerful hydrolic-suspension units in order to
ensure a good grip on the ceiling and floor of the shafts.
There is nothing in the Videoscopische study about ventilation. What it
describes is unambiguously an exploration into the unchartered regions of
the Great Pyramid, an adventure in the Queen’s Chamber shafts - a
‘robot’s journey into the past’.’ Nevertheless the next move was logical
enough: Stadelmann passed over the EAO’s ‘ventilation’ scheme to
Rudolf Gantenbrink.
Nor did Gantenbrink object. He had intended, in any case, to examine
the King’s Chamber shafts at some point during his project and saw no
difficulty in fitting these shafts with the electric fans called for by the
ventilation scheme. Indeed the idea of getting involved in ventilating the



120 Seekers
Pyramid as well as exploring it rather appealed to him since it added a
‘conservation and restoration’ element to his work.
Diversion and delay
As planned, however, Gantenbrink began with the exploration of the
Queen’s Chamber shafts. Assigned by the German Archaeological
Institute to assist Gantenbrink, and to serve as the Institute’s official
representative on site, was Uh Kapp (who, coincidentally, had also
assisted Mark Lehner on the ARCE Sphinx Project in 1979-80).*^ The
start date was February 1992 and the decision was made to tackle the
southern shaft firsF - the very shaft in which, in March 1993, the ‘door’
would be discovered.
The initial exploration of the shaft was not as simple as Gantenbrink
had supposed. He had to adapt to the rather oppressive conditions within
the Queen’s Chamber and found that manoeuvring the sturdy little robot
inside the confined space of the narrow and steeply sloping shaft was
difficult and extremely slow work. By mid-May 1992, however, he had
made considerable progress, penetrating to a depth of 70 feet. Further¬
more, as he peered curiously into his monitor screen, he could see the shaft
disappearing into the deep, dark distance beyond. Where did it lead to.?
Was it really abandoned’ as the majority of Egyptologists maintained,* or
did it serve some yet unknown and greater function? Hitherto Egyptolo¬
gists had theorized that this shaft would not be more than 30 feet long but
now Gantenbrink had proved them wrong. What could possibly lie ahead?
The desire to continue was irresistible. But at this nail-biting stage he
was called to attend to the secondary ingredient of his project - the
‘ventilation’ ofthe Great Pyramid using the shafts ofthe King’s Chamber.
Since these extend from the Chamber’s northern and southern walls
right through to the outside of the Pyramid, Gantenbrink was able to
investigate them with a much simpler device than that required for the
Queen’s Chamber shafts. This device he named Upuaut /. Resembling a
crude, miniature sledge, and mounted with a video camera, it could be
hauled up and down the shafts by means of cables with pulleys at both ends.
Upuaut I could only look at the King’s Chamber shafts - where it found
little of interest. The cleaning job was done in a quainter manner.



The Case of the Robot, the Germans and the Door 121
Gantenbrink made use of an old axle from the wreck of an abandoned
truck in the nearby village of Nazlet-el-Sammam, which he attached to a
cable and yanked up and down the shafts to push out the debris and sand
that had piled up inside them. This done he arranged for sponsors to
supply and install electric fans and then informed the German Archaeo¬
logical Institute that he would now prepare for the continuation of his
exploration of the much more promising and mysterious ‘blind-ended’
shafts of the Queen’s Chamber.
Upuautn
Gantenbrink enthusiastically proposed to Stadelmann that he would
develop an even more powerful robot, to be named Upuaut //, in order to
launch the final assault on the cramped and inaccessible shafts. This new
machine would be specially designed to overcome the difficulties
encountered by its predecessor (the prototype robot, used in early 1992,
now discarded and jocularly named ‘the father of Upuauf) in the first
attempt to explore these shafts. Upuaut //, Gantenbrink had decided,
would be smaller, smarter, and much stronger. He opted to design it from
scratch and to this end brought together a team of engineering and
electronic experts, mostly volunteers, in a special laboratory in Munich.
What they were to come up with during the course ofthe next year was a
marvel of the space age. The body of the robot was made of a particularly
light but robust aluminium used in aircraft components. A sophisticated
laser was included which could probe any small and inaccessible regions
within the shaft. Hundreds of electronic components were used to form
the electronic ‘brain’ and guidance system of the robot. Specially designed
motors and gears were fitted to the front and rear of the main body, and
steel struts were added for extra stability. Even hydraulic high-pressure
pistons were included, capable of generating a thrust of 200 kilograms to
ensure that the robot could brace itself tightly within the shaft. A new
camera unit was also designed that could swivel not only horizontally but
also vertically to catch every conceivable angle of view. Two powerful
high-intensity bulbs, fitted on each side of the camera, would illuminate
the way ahead. Finally a special eight-wheel drive system - four gripping
the floor and four gripping the roof of the shaft - would ensure that the
robot could reach its final destination.

Problems with permits
During the latter part of 1992 and the early part of 1993, while Upuaut II
was being designed and built in Munich, Rudolf Gantenbrink arranged
for a television crew to come with him to Egypt to film his forthcoming
exploration of the Queen’s Chamber shafts. W^hen he and the crew
(including the film-maker Jochen Breitenstein and an assistant, Dirk
Brakebusch) arrived in Cairo on 6 March 1993? however, the exploration
and filming were delayed by something that at first appeared to be only a
minor administrative problem: the German Archaeological Institute had
not yet obtained the necessary filming permits from the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization. When no permits were forthcoming, Ganten¬
brink reports that first Dr Stadelmann and then he himself approached
Zahi Hawass, the EAO s Director-General of the Giza Pyramids, who
granted ‘verbal permission’ for the filming to go ahead.’
Accordingly, the exploration began.
Discovery
Mid-March 1993 was a crucial period for Rudolf Gantenbrink in his work
inside the Great Pyramid - all the more crucial because: (a) the whole
operation had cost him a great deal of money (including $250,000 in
research-and-development costs for the robot alone); (b) it was being
filmed at personal expense for a commercial documentary and (c) a
deadline for the completion of the film had been set for the last week of March.
R was at around this time, says Gantenbrink, that Stadelmann recalled
Uli Kapp and withdrew the official support that the German Archaeologi¬
cal Institute had previously accorded to the exploration of the shafts.
Perhaps other men would have stopped and gone meekly home at this
point. Gantenbrink is far from meek. Feeling that he was on the verge of a
breakthrough, he decided that he was going to forge on - with or without Stadelmann’s support.
The crucial figure was now Zahi Hawass, whose personal authority on
the site provided the whole ‘official’ sanction and backing for Ganten
brink’s work. However, Hawass’s undocumented ‘verbal permission’
actually counted for a great deal on the Giza plateau. Indeed it was as good
as a signed and sealed mandate to the lowly ghafirs guarding the entrance



The Case of the Robot, the Germans and the Door 123
to the Great Pyramid and was taken at face value not only by Gantenbrink
and his team but also by a young inspector from the EAO, Muhammad
Shahy, who had been assigned to work with the Germans.'®
So Gantenbrink reasoned that he would still be able to go in and out and
work undisturbed in the Queen’s Chamber. This he successfully did,
making rapid progress with the robot in the exploration of both the
northern and the southern shafts.
Early on the morning of 21 March 1993, just before starting the day’s
work as usual, he paid a visit to Zahi Hawass at his office on the Giza
plateau. There, to his consternation, he learned that the Director of the
Giza Pyramids had been suspended from his post on account of an
unrelated scandal concerning a missing Fourth-Dynasty statue." (Hawass
was not to be reinstated as Director of the Giza Pyramids until April
1994.)
This unexpected turn of events could not have come at a more vital
moment - for by 21 March 1993 Upuaut //was deep inside the southern
shaft of the Queen’s Chamber and was, in Gantenbrink’s opinion, very
close to whatever lay at the end. The exploration, however, was to go on.
Destiny had fixed an amazing rendezvous for Gantenbrink on the next
day, 22 March, coincidentally the spring equinox.
With him in the Queen’s Chamber on that fateful day were Jochen
Breitenstein, Dirk Brakebusch and Muhammad Shahy.'^ By 10 a.m.
Gantenbrink had managed to manoeuvre Upuaut //a distance of 170 feet
up the shaft. At about 180 feet a sharp settlement in the floor of the shaft
created a dangerous obstacle that threatened to halt progress but that was
eventually surmounted. Then, barely an hour later, at 11.05 a.m., after
crawling a total distance of 200 feet into the shaft, the floor and walls
became smooth and polished and the robot suddenly - and one might
almost say ‘in the nick of time’ - reached the end of its journey.
As the first images of the ‘door’ with its peculiar metal fittings appeared
on the small television monitor in the Queen’s Chamber, Rudolf
Gantenbrink immediately realised the massive implications of his find.
This was archaeological history in the making'^ - an exciting and
significant new discovery inside the world’s most famous and most
mysterious ancient monument. And it was interesting to note that under
the lower western comer of the ‘door’ there was a little gap beneath which



124 Seekers
the red laser spot projected by Upuaut was seen to disappear. The urge to
look under the ‘door’ and see whatever might lie beyond it must have been
almost unbearable. The gap, however, was far too small for Upuaufs
camera to be able to peer into. A fibre-optic lens would need to be added if
that was to be done, but rigging it would take days, perhaps even weeks, to
organize.
After the initial excitement had died down, Gantenbrink’s first instinct
was to make doubly certain that the unique video images that he had been
looking at on the screen had been properly recorded. Once he was satisfied
that the recordings were excellent, he and his team packed the tapes,
together with the rest of their gear, and returned to their base at the
Movenpick Hotel.
For several days after 22 March nothing happened, with no official
announcement of any kind being made to the press by the German
Archaeological Institute. The reason, it seems, was that Dr Stadelmann
could not make up his mind as to what form, exactly, such an
announcement should take. During this hiatus, Gantenbrink and the film
crew decided to return to Munich. They naturally took along all their
equipment, including the twenty-eight videotapes shot during the
exploration. A few days later, at the beginning ofApril 1993, Gantenbrink
sent us a copy of the tape showing the discovery of the ‘door’.
We passed this tape on to the British media.
Much ado, then nothing
The first major story appeared on the front page of the London
Independent on 16 April 1993:
Archaeologists have discovered the entrance to a previously unknown
chamber within the largest of Egypt’s Pyramids. Some evidence suggests it
might contain the royal treasures of the Pharaoh Cheops [Khufu], for whom
the Great Pyramid was built 4500 years ago. The contents of the chamber are
almost certainly intact. The entrance is at the end of a sloping passage 65
metres long but only eight inches (20 cms) wide and eight inches high
According to the Belgian Egyptologist Robert Bauval, the passage points
directly at the Dog star Sirius, held by the ancient Egyptians to be the
incarnation of the goddess Isis. Other small passages in the Pyramid appear to



The Case of the Robot, the Germans and the Door 125
point to other heavenly bodies - the Belt ofOrion and the star Alpha Draconis,
which at the time was in the area now occupied by the Pole Star . . .
The reaction to the Independent'^ front-page splash was electrifying.
Dozens of reporters from all over the world wanted to interview
Gantenbrink within hours and that same evening Britain’s Channel 4 TV
News covered the story in depth. Dr I. E. S. Edwards made a rare
appearance in this report and created something of a sensation by telling
millions of excited viewers that ‘a statue of the king gazing towards the
constellation of Orion’ might be found behind the mysterious ‘door’. ‘But
it’s a wild guess — we have no precedents,’ he was quick to add.
But wild guess or not, and still with no clear statement emanating from
Cairo, the international media had a field day:
‘pyramid may hold pharaoh’s secrets’ ran the front page of The Age
in Melbourne; ‘secret chamber may solve pyramid riddle’ shouted The
Times in London; ‘nouveau mystere dans la pyramide’ Le Monde
announced excitedly in Paris; ‘pyramid mystery’ reported the Los Angeles
Times\ ‘viVE LA technique: PORTE pour kheops!’ cried Le Matin in
Switzerland.''^
It was almost as though the cult of the Pyramid had suddenly come to
life again. At any rate the story continued to run for many more weeks in
dozens of regional newspapers and several international magazines.'’
Everyone, it seemed, wanted to know what was behind the little ‘door’,
and why the Pyramid’s shafts were directed towards the stars . . .
The first official riposte came from the German Archaeological
Institute, through Reuters in Germany, on 16 April 1993. Mrs Christine
Egorov, Stadelmann’s secretary — here presented as the Institutsprecherin
firmly pronounced that the very idea of a possible chamber at the end of
the shaft was nonsense. The Queen’s Chamber’s ‘air-channels’, she
explained, did not head in the direction of anything at all and the purpose
of Gantenbrink’s robot had been solely ‘to measure the humidity of the
Pyramid’.'^
Soon afterwards, a second report went out on the Reuters wire, this
time quoting Dr Stadelmann: ‘I don’t know how this story happened but I
can tell you this is very annoying,’ he fumed. ‘There is surely no other
chamber . . . there is no room behind the stone.’



126 Seekers
Political games
In the years that followed Gantenbrink made repeated efforts to get his
exploration of the Queen’s Chamber shafts restarted, arguing that there
was no need to speculate as to whether or not the ‘door’ was really a door,
or whether there might or might not be a chamber concealed behind it:
I take an absolutely neutral position. It is a scientific process, and there is no
need whatsoever to answer questions with speculation when questions could
be answered much more easily by continuing the research ... We have a
device (ultrasonic) that would discover if there is a cavity behind the slab. It’s
nonsensical to make theories when we have the tools to discover the facts.”*
One of the main problems that Gantenbrink faced was that he did not
belong to the Egyptological profession but was regarded by the leading
academics at (jiza as a hired technician - which meant, by definition, that
his views were assumed to have no merit. He explained how, after
discovermg the slab-door in March 1993, he had been all but ignored and
the find handled with indifference: ‘I was scheduled to meet the Minister
of Culture about the discovery, but it never happened. A press conference was scheduled. It never happened.’
In late 1994, Gantenbrink announced in Paris that he was willing to
supply the robot to the Egyptians and even train an Egyptian technician at
his own expense so that the exploration could resume, but a few weeks
later he was politely rebuffed by the EAO’s Chairman, Dr Nur El Din:
‘Thank you for your offer to train the Egyptian technician [Nur El Din
had wntten] . . . unfortunately we are very busy for the time being, therefore we will postpone the matter.’
The search for truth’, Gantenbrink commented in January 1995, ‘is too
important to be ruined by a silly political game. My only hope is that they
will soon reach the same conclusions.’
Breakfast with Gantenbrink
On 19 February 1995 we arrived in Egypt and the next morning had
breakfast with Rudolf Gantenbrink at the Movenpick Hotel in Giza.
He had been in Egypt for most of the previous week, still trying to
obtain permission to resume his exploration of the Queen’s Chamber
shafts, and was returning to Munich later that morning. During his visit.



The Case of the Robot, the Germans and the Door 127
he told us, he had finally managed to have a face-to-face meeting with Dr
Nur El Din.
‘What was the response.?’ we asked.
Gantenbrink shrugged his shoulders: ‘Encouraging.’ But he looked less
than encouraged.
We then asked if he had been back inside the Queen’s Chamber on this
visit.
‘No,’ he replied, ‘I prefer not to go there.’
He could not bear the thought, he told us, of returning to the site of his
great discovery without his robot, purposelessly, like a tourist. ‘I will go
back in the Queen’s Chamber with Upuaut and complete the exploration
of the shafts,’ he said proudly, ‘or I won’t go back there at all.’
Select groups
That same month - February 1995 - one of the most prosperous and
active members of the Association for Research and Enlightenment spoke
to us by telephone from the United States about plans that were in hand
for furthering the quest for the Hall of Records at the Giza necropolis:
The next three years are going to be super years . . . We sort ofhave ’96 set up
for our little expedition to the Sphinx - with underground radar. 1996 was
when Zahi said we’d be able to go. We’ll do more ground-scanning and most of
all we’re going to get to love and understand the people around us, and the
various groups, and work with them . . . and I figure that by ’98 we’ll hit
something.^
We learnt in the same conversation that the same individual had been
keeping a close watch on events surrounding the hidden door in the Great
Pyramid during the two years since Rudolf Gantenbrink’s project had
ground to a halt. He claimed to have been informed that the Egyptian
authorities would soon make an attempt to reach the door with their own
robot in order to insert a fibre-optic camera beneath it and to see whatever
lies beyond. Our informant also said that he had been invited by ‘Zahi’ to
be amongst the select group of witnesses present inside the Pyramid when
this moment eventually comes: ‘He promised me a one-month’s advance
notice before they do anything . . . Something’s definitely going to
happen. He’s not sure when. He had delays -1 think with the robot - but
they’ll get it done . . .’ ^^



128 Seekers
But what exactly will get done? By whom? With what niotive? How
certain is it that the public will be properly informed about any further
discoveries that might be made? And how reliable and comprehensive are
the orthodox Egyptological interpretations of such discoveries likely to be?
One thing at any rate seems certain: Rudolf Gantenbrink, whose
inventiveness and daring led to the original discovery of the door at the
end of the Queen’s Chamber’s mysterious southern shaft, is unlikely to be
present. In September 1995 it was reported to us that the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization had issued notification to the German author¬
ities advising that they did not wish to pursue the exploration in the Great Pyramid.^"*
Burial
After reviewing the scholarly goings on concerning the possible geological
antiquity ofthe Sphinx and the ‘anomalies’ located in the bedrock beneath
it, the case of the iron plate in the southern shaft of the King’s Chamber,
and the case of the relics found in the shafts of the Queen’s Chamber, we
are frankly not surprised by the case of Gantenbrink’s ‘door’. Here, too,
orthodox academics have participated in the burial of research’ that
promises new insights into the Giza monuments and - more than three
years after the discovery - the ‘door’ still remained unopened.
We have no opinion as to whether or not it might lead to a ‘Hall of
Records’ - ‘records’ on papyrus scrolls to do with the ‘religion’ of the
builders as Zahi Hawass speculated in 1993 during his year of absence
from his post as Director of the Giza Pyramids.^ Our own research has
convinced us, however, that the shaft in which Rudolf Gantenbrink made
his remarkable discovery is linked to an archaic system of beliefs and
rituals that envisaged the monuments of the Giza necropolis as an ‘image of heaven’.
In Parts III and IV we will attempt to decode this image and learn its meaning.

The Clues of Duality
‘Newton . . . was the last of the magicians . ..
Why do I call him a magician? Because he
looked at the whole universe and all that is in
it as a riddle, as a secret that could be read by
applying pure thought to certain evidence,
certain mystic clues which God had laid
about the world to allow a sort of
philosopher’s treasure hunt to the esoteric
brotherhood. He beUeved that these clues
were to be found partly in the heavens . . .
partly in certain papers and traditions
handed down by the bretheren ... By pure
thought, by concentration of mind, the
riddle, he believed, would be revealed to the
initiate. ..’
John Maynard Keynes, The Royal Society,
Newton Tercentenary Celebrations, 1947
We saw in Parts I and II how the astronomical character ofthe architecture
ofthe Sphinx and ofthe Giza Pyramids has failed to interest Egyptologists
and has not been taken into account in their analysis of the function and
significance ofthe monuments. This, in our view, has resulted in a number
of serious misinterpretations of the available evidence - perhaps the most
flagrant examples of which, at the level of physical exploration and
research, have been the chronic neglect of the four astronomically aligned
shafts of the Great Pyramid and the long and shocking period of inactivity
over the matter ofthe ‘door’ in the southern shaft ofthe Queen’s Chamber.
We hinted at the end ofPart I that the logic ofall these shafts, and of the
ground-plan and symbolism of the Pyramids and the Sphinx, appears to
be connected to certain very powerful religious and cosmological ideas set
out in ancient Egyptian funerary and rebirth texts and in the so-called



132 Duality
‘Hermetic’ writings. These express the philosophy ‘as above, so below’
and advocate the drawing down to earth of cosmic powers as an essential
step in Mankind’s quest for knowledge of the divine and immortality of
the soul: ‘And I, said Hermes, will make Mankind intelligent, I will confer
wisdom on them, and make known to them the truth. I will never cease to
benefit thereby the life of mortal men; and then will I benefit each one of
them, when the force of nature working in him is in accord with the
movement of the stars above.’ ‘
In the following chapters we will offer evidence to suggest that the
extraordinary monuments of the Giza necropolis are part of a grand and
long-forgotten scheme to initiate certain select individuals, the most
recent of whom were the Pharaohs of Egypt, into an esoteric cosmic
wisdom linking earth to heaven by means ofwhich they sincerely expected
to transcend the limits of death:
All the world which lies below has been set in order and filled with contents by
the things which are placed above; for the things below have not the power to
set in order the world above. The weaker mysteries must yield to the stronger; and the system of things on high is stronger than the things below.^
Thy protector is the Star-God ... thy soul passeth on ... thy body is
equipped with power. . . The doors ofthe hidden land are opened before thee . . . Osiris, conqueror of millions of years, cometh unto thee . .
Cosmic environment
The world view of the ancient Egyptians, which they appear to have
inherited intact and fully formed at the very beginning of their historical
civilization some 5000 years ago, was profoundly dualistic and cosmologi¬
cal. The foundation of Pharaonic theocracy, the unification of the ‘Two
Lands of Upper and Lower Egypt into one kingdom, the notions that
they had of their own past and ancestry, their laws and calendrical
measures, the architecture of their temples and pyramid complexes, and
even the land of Egypt itself and the Nile - all these were cosmological
concepts to them. Indeed, they saw their cosmic environment (the sky, the
Milky Way, the sun and the stars, the moon and the planets, and all their
cycles) as being bound together in perfect duality with their earthly
environment (their land and the Nile, their living king and his ancestors,
and the cycles of the seasons and epochs).



The Clues of Duality 133
We suspect that the history of ancient Egypt, to the extent that it was
written down at all in papyri and tablets and inscriptions, was frequently
expressed in a kind of‘cosmic code’ ritualistically and symbolically linked
— like the Pyramids themselves — to the ever-changing patterns of the sky.
From this it follows that we must look to the sky, just as the Egyptians did,
ifwe wish to understand the ideas that they were trying to communicate in
their (on the face of things) extremely strange and problematic religious
writings. These writings include mysterious and archaic texts aimed at
guiding the afterlife journey of the deceased, such as the Book ofthe Dead
✓
(which the ancient Egyptians knew as Per-Em-Hru^ the Book of‘Coming
Forth By Day’), the Book of Two Ways, the Book of Gates, the Book of
What is in the Duat and the Coffin Texts. Oldest and most enigmatic of all
these funerary and rebirth documents however, are the so-called Pyramid
Texts which began to be copied and compiled from older sources in the
second half of the third millennium BC. These remarkable records have
come down to us in the form of lavish hieroglyphic inscriptions on the
tomb walls ofa number of Fifth- and Sixth-Dynasty pyramids at Saqqara,
some ten miles to the south of the Giza necropolis, and offer us a hitherto
neglected key by means of which the secrets ofthe great Pyramids and the
Sphinx can be unlocked.
Astronomical essence
All the above-named documents, and many more, have been translated
into modem languages during the past hundred years, and all have been
studied by scholars - the majority of whom would not dispute that they
incorporate a complex network of astronomical references, symbols,
allegories and allusions.'' Only a handful of researchers, however, have
considered the possibihty that these astronomical characteristics could
constitute the essence of the texts. In this group the late Giorgio de
Santillana and Hertha von Dechend, whose study, Hamlet’s Mill, we
encountered in Chapter 4, have commented on the manner in which the
soul of the deceased Pharaoh was thought of as having travelled through
the skies:
. . . well-equipped . . . with his Pyramid Text or Coffin Text, which
represented his indispensable timetable and contained the ordained addresses
of every celestial individual he was expected to meet. The Pharaoh relied upon



134 Duality
his particular text as the less distinguished dead relied upon^his copy of
chapters from the Book ofthe Dead, and he was prepared to change shape into
the . . . semblance of whatever celestial ‘station’ must be passed, and to recite
the fitting formulae to overcome hostile beings . . /
Santillana and von Dechend also comment, somewhat witheringly, on the
hopeless inadequacy of many of the translations that scholars work with
today — translations which treat the astronomical aspects of the texts as
though they are of no particular relevance:
So the elaborate instructions in the Book ofthe Dead, referring to the soul’s
celestial voyage, translate into ‘mystical’ talk, and must be treated as holy
mumbo jumbo. But then, modern translators believe so firmly in their own
invention, according to which the underworld has to be looked for in the
interior of our globe - instead of in the sky - that even 370 specific astronomical terms would not cause them to stumble.*
Xhe problem identified here is, we will demonstrate, a large and multi¬
faceted one which has led scholarly analysis of the texts into a blind alley
through a complete and conspicuous neglect of: (a) the most important
religious concept of the ancient Egyptians; (b) the most vital feature of
their land and sky and (c) the most fundamental element of their spiritual and cosmological beliefs.
Otherworld
In the earliest religious writings that have survived from ancient Egypt a
powerful symbolic terminology is used to describe the cosmic ‘world of
the dead’ and its features. This world is referred to as the Duaf - a concept
that is routinely translated by modem Egyptologists as ‘the Underworld’
(or sometimes as the ‘Netherworld’).* In the Pyramid Texts, however, the
Duat is clearly a location in the starry sky - as many distinguished
Egyptologists ofearlier generations such as Selim Hassan, Sir E. A. Wallis
Budge and Kurt Sethe were undoubtedly aware.’ Yet even these pioneers
failed to get to grips with the full implications and characteristics of the
concept because they lacked familiarity with astronomy.
For example, in his analysis of the various ways in which the word Duat
was inscribed in hieroglyphic characters throughout the whole span of
Egyptian history, Selim Hassan makes the following comment: ‘If we
consider the evidence afforded by the meaning of its name during the Old



The Clues of Duality 135
Kingdom [the Pyramid Age], we shall see that the original Duat, the future
Underworld, was localized in the sky.’*” He then cites the view of Kurt
Sethe that ‘the Dual could be either the red glow of twilight which
precedes the dawn (i.e. the “false dawn”) or the spacious region in the east
of the sky where this glow appears . . "
Hassan goes on to quote from line 151 ofthe Pyramid Texts: ‘Orion has
been enveloped by the Duat\ while he who lives in the Horizon (i.e. Re [the
sun-god]) purifies himself; Sothis [Sirius] has been enveloped by the Duat
... in the embrace of [their] father Atum.’
In Hassan’s opinion: ‘This clearly shows how, as the sun rises and
purifies himself in the Horizon, the stars Orion and Sothis [Sirius], with
whom the King is identified, are enveloped by the Duat. This is a true
observation of nature, and it really appears as though the stars are
swallowed up each morning in the increasing glow of the dawn. Perhaps
the determinative of the word Duat., the star within a circle, illustrates the
idea of this enveloping of the star. When on his way to join the stars, the
dead king must first pass by (or through) the Duat which will serve to
guide him in the right direction. Thus we see in Utterance 610 [of the
Pyramid Texts]: “The Duat guides your feet to the Dwelling-place of
Orion . . . The Duat guides your hand to the Dwelling-place of
Orion.” ..
Stars rising with the sun
Hassan’s assessment of the celestial landscape of the Duat is only accurate
in as much as he realizes that it is in the east, that the moment of
observation is the pre-dawn (which he calls ‘false dawn’, and that the
constellation ofOrion (Osiris), the star Sirius (Isis), the sun (Re), and some
other cosmic feature representing ‘Atum’ (the ‘Father’ ofthe Gods), are all
to be found in the Duat. Because he is not conversant with basic celestial
mechanics, however, and because he fails to set the relevant lines from the
Pyramid Texts in the context of their time and their place, he then goes on
to make a serious error of interpretation which has subsequently been
compounded by numerous other astronomically illiterate scholars:
1 The time the Pyramid Texts were compiled was the epoch of 2800 BC
to 2300 BC approximately.*^
2 The place of observation of the sky was just south of modem Cairo in
the so-called ‘Memphite necropolis’ (named after Men-nefer, later

The Clues of Duality 137
35. Rising points of the sun at the solstices and equinoxes as observed from the Memphite
necropolis. In the epoch of 2500 BC - the ‘Pyramid Age’ - the Duat was observed and
considered to be active only at the time of the summer solstice when the stars of Orion and
Sirius rose heliacally (i.e. just ahead of the sun) at dawn.
‘Memphis’, the first historically recognized capital of ancient Egypt),
where stand the great Pyramids of Giza (and also lesser Old Kingdom
pyramids such as those at Abu Roash, Abusir, Saqqara, Dahshur and
Meidum).^^
3 The error that Hassan makes is his assumption that the stars in
question — i.e. Orion and Sirius - are swallowed up ‘each morning’ in
the ‘increasing glow of the dawn.’
In fact there is only one time of the year when this ‘swallowing-up’
occurs — a time that slowly alters down the epochs because of the earth’s
precessional motion. The long and the short of it is that in the Pyramid
Age the specific phenomena described in the texts, and addressed by



138 Duality
Hassan (phenomena known technically as the ‘heliacal risings’ of Orion
and Sirius, i.e. the risings ofthese stars just ahead ofthe sun at dawn) could
only have been observed at around midsummer — i.e. ut the suirirner
solstice. The Duat, in other words, was considered by the ancient
Egyptians to be active only at the time of the summer solstice when Orion
and Sirius rose heliacally and not, as Hassan suggests, throughout the year.
With these facts in mind, let us attempt to reinterpret the cosmic Duat,
this time placing it in its proper astronomical context.
Cosmic river
One ofthe most salient features ofthe as it is described in the ancient
Egyptian texts, is its relationship to a great cosmic ‘river’ called the
‘Winding Waterway’. Several studies have confirmed beyond any serious
doubt that the ‘Winding Waterway’ was the magical band of light
meandering across the sky that we know as the ‘Milky Way’.*^ It is also
evident that the ancient priest-astronomers who compiled the Pyramid
Texts identified the terrestrial counterpart of this ‘Winding Waterway’ in
the sky as the River Nile and its yearly flood, the ‘Great Inundation’,
which also happened to coincide with the summer solstice;*’
The Winding Waterway is flooded, the Fields of Rushes are filled with water,
and I am ferried over thereon to yonder eastern side ofthe Sky, the place where
the gods fashioned me . . . [Orion’s] sister is Sothis [Sirius] . .
I have come to my waterways which are in the bank ofthe Flood ofthe Great
Inundation, to the place of contentment. . . which is in the Horizon . . .*’
May you lift me and raise me to the Winding Waterway, may you set me among the gods, the Imperishable stars . .
As Sir E. A. Wallis Budge rightly observed: ‘the Egyptians . . . from the
earliest times . . . depicted to themselves a material heaven [the Duat]
on the banks of a Heavenly Nile, whereon they built cities.”* And
similarly the philologist Raymond Faulkner, who translated the Pyramid
Texts and much of the other religious literature of ancient Egypt into
English, could not avoid making the obvious correlations between the
celestial river’, the ‘Winding Waterway’ and the Milky Way.’’



The Clues of Duality 139
Kingdom of Osiris in the sky
The stars of Orion and Sirius are located on the right bank of the Milky
Way, which - at the summer solstice in the Pyramid Age - would have
appeared as a vertical ‘cosmic river’ in the pre-dawn in the east.
To the ancient Egyptians, therefore, the Duat could not possibly have
been seen merely as some vague, blank, rose-tinted region somewhere
over the eastern horizon. On the contrary, it clearly had an extremely
specific address in the sky - the ‘Dwelling Place’ of‘Orion and Sirius’ on
the banks of the ‘celestial Nile’:
Be firm O Osiris-King [Orion] on the underside of the sky with the Beautiful
Star [Sirius] upon the bend of the Winding Waterway . .
Betake yourself to the Waterway . . . May a stairway to the Duat be set for
you to the place where Orion is . .
O King, you are this Great Star, the companion ofOrion, who traverses the
sky with Orion, who navigates [in] the Duat with Osiris . .
36. The sky region of the Duat with the stars ofOrion and Sirius rising heliacally just ahead of
the sun at dawn on the summer solstice. It was at this time ofthe year, and at this moment only,
that the Duat was considered to be ‘active’. Note that the Milky Way at this same moment
appeared as a vertical ‘cosmic river’ in the east. Also shown is the trajectory of the Orion stars
after their dawn rising until their culmination at the meridian.



140 Duality
With this starry landscape in mind, we can begin to conjure up a fairly
detailed image of the Duat, the ‘Kingdom of Osiris’ in the sky - a distinct
pattern ofstars, at a specific celestial location, that comes complete with its own ‘cosmic Nile’.
But when was this cosmic kingdom ‘founded’.?
‘First Time’
In their most profound and beautiful religious texts, as we noted in Part I,
the ancient Egyptians spoke of‘the time ofthe gods’, Zep Tepi (literally the
‘First Time’) with the unshakeable conviction that there had indeed been
such an epoch. In other words, they beheved that Zep Tepi had been an
actual, historical event. In line with their prevailing dualism they also
beheved that it had been projected and ‘recorded’ in the catalogue of the
stairy sky. Indeed it was a story that was re-enacted endlessly in the cosmic
setting by the cyclical displays of the celestial orbs and the constellations.
What they had in mind, in other words, was a kind of cosmic ‘passion
play , expressed in the language of allegorical astronomy, in which each
main character was identified with a specific celestial body. Re was the sun,
Osiris was Orion, Isis was the star Sirius, Thoth was the moon - and so on
and so forth. Nor was the drama only confined to the celestial realms; on
the contrary, as one might expect in dualistic ancient Egypt, it was also’re¬
enacted on the ground, amidst the cosmic ambiance of the astronomical
Pyramids of Giza, where the events of the ‘First Time’ were commemo¬
rated for millennia in secret rituals and liturgies.^
Very little is known about these hturgies, or about the myths they
expressed. As the Egyptologist R. T. Rundle Qark explains:
The creation of the myths was founded on certain principles. These are
strange and, as yet, only partially understood. The most important element seems to have been as follows:
(a) The basic principles of life, nature and society were determined by the
gods long ago, before the establishment of kingship. This epoch - Zep Tept
Ithe First Time’ - stretched from the first stirring of the High God in the
Primeval Waters to the settling of Horus upon the throne and the redemption
of Osiris. All proper myths relate events or manifestations of this epoch
(b) Anything whose existence or authority had to be justified or explained
must be referred to the ‘First Time’. This was true for natural phenomena
rituals, royal insignia, the plans of temples, magical or medical formulae the



The Clues of Duality 141
hieroglyphic system of writing, the calendar — the whole paraphernalia of the civilization . .
Rimdle Clark has also recognized that Egyptian art ‘is nearly all
symbolism’, that ‘the architectural arrangements and decoration were a
kind of mythical landscape’ worked down to the last detail, and that
everything had a meaning:
The shrine [tomb or pyramid complex] of the god [the king], for instance, was
the ‘Horizon’, the land of glorious light beyond the dawn horizon where the
gods dwelt. The Temple was an image of the universe as it now existed and, at
the same time, the land on which it stood was the Primeval Mound which arose
from the waters of the Primeval Ocean at Creation ... At the close ofthe daily
temple service, the priests raised a small figure of Maat (the goddess of Law
and Order) in front of the divine image. This act was meant to assert that
rightness and order had been re-established, but it was also a repetition of an
event that took place at the beginning of the world ... of some mythical
happening in the time of the gods . .
Golden Age and the entry of evil
In later chapters we shall be returning to take a closer look at this ‘First
Time’ of the gods. Here, however, it is sufficient to note that Zep Tepi was
regarded as a mysterious and wonderful golden age that had immediately
followed Creation. Furthermore, in the minds of the ancient Egyptians at
least, this golden age had not occurred in some hard-to-find never-never
land like the Biblical ‘Garden of Eden’ but in a familiar and unmistakably
real physical and historical setting. Indeed it was their emphatic beliefthat
the huge triangular region just south of the apex of the Nile Delta
encompassing HeliopoHs, Memphis and Giza was the actual geographical
location of the events of the ‘First Time’ - a real ‘Garden of Eden’, in
short, with real geographical features and places. It was here, amidst this
sacred landscape, that the gods of the ‘First Time’ were said in the texts to
have established their earthly kingdom.^’
And what was the cultural character of that Kingdom.? Rundle Clark
gives the best summary:
... all that was good or efficacious was established on the principles laid down
in the ‘First Time’ - which was, therefore, a golden age of absolute perfection
- ‘before rage or clamour or strife or uproar had come about’. No death,
disease or disaster occurred in this blissful epoch, known variously as ‘the time
of Re’, ‘the time of Osiris’, or ‘the time of Horus’ . .



142 Duality
37. The huge trianplar region just south of the apex of the Nile Delta encompassing
Heliopolis, Memphis and Giza was regarded by the ancient Egyptians as the actual
geographical location of the events of the ‘First Time’ - a sort of geodetic ‘Garden of Eden’ focused on astronomical latitude 30 degrees north.



The Clues of Duality 143
The gods Osiris and Horus, together with Re (in his composite form as
Re-Atum, the ‘Father’ of the gods) were regarded by the ancient
Egyptians as the supreme expressions and exemplars ofthe ‘blissful epoch
of the “First Time”
Osiris they remembered in particular for having been the first to sit on
the throne of this divine Kingdom, which he ruled jointly with his consort
Isis.^^ The golden age of plenty over which the royal couple presided
(during which agriculture and animal husbandry were taught to humans
and laws and rehgious doctrines were set for them) was however brought
to an abrupt and violent halt when Osiris was murdered by his brother,
Seth. Left without child, Isis brought the dead Osiris back to life for long
enough to receive his seed. As a result ofthis union she, in due course, gave
birth to Horus whose destiny it was to wrangle back the ‘kingdom of
Osiris’ from the clutches of his evil uncle Seth.
Shabaka texts
In all its essential elements this is, of course, the story that we know as
Hamlet (which has a far older pedigree than the Shakespeare play^^), and it
is also, in its most recent Hollywood manifestation, the story of the Lion
King (brother murders brother, bereaved son of the murder victim takes
revenge on his uncle and sets the Kingdom to rights).
The original Egyptian version of the story — the so-called ‘Memphite
Theology’ — is found in texts inscribed on a monument known as the
‘Shabaka Stone’, now in the British Museum.^'* Here we read how, after a
great quarrel between Horus and Seth (in which Horus lost an eye and
Seth a testicle) Geb, the earth-god (the father of Osiris and Isis),
summoned the Great Council of the Gods - the nine-member ‘Ennead’ of
Heliopolis - and with them passed judgement between Horus and Seth:
Geb, lord ofthe gods, commanded the Nine Gods to gather to him. He judged
between Horus and Seth; he ended their quarrel. He made Seth king ofUpper
Egypt, up to the place in which he was born, which is Su. And Geb made
Horus king of Lower Egypt, up to the place in which his father [Osiris] was
drowned^' which is ‘Division-of-the-Two-Lands’. Thus Horus stood over
one region, and Seth stood over one region. They made peace over the Two
Lands at Ayan. That was the division of the Two Lands . .



144 Duality
Let us note in passing that Ayan is not a mythical place but was an actual,
physical location in ancient Egypt immediately to the north of Memphis,
the Early Dynastic capital city.^^ The judgement that was made here was
later changed, as the Shabaka Texts go on to tell us:
Then it seemed wrong to Geb that the portion ofHorus was like the portion of
Seth. So Geb gave to Horus his [Seth’s] inheritance, for he [Horus] is the son of his first bom [Osiris] .. .
Then Horus stood over the two lands. He is the uniter of the Two Lands,
proclaimed in the great name: Ta-tenen, ‘South-of-his-Wall’, ‘Lord of
Eternity’... He is Horus, who arose as King ofUpper and Lower Egypt, who
united the Two Lands in the [District] of the Wall [Memphis], the place where the Two Lands were united ..
Treasure trail
What we have in this amazing story is a sort of treasure trail of clues as to
how the ancient Egyptians themselves saw the mythical-historical transfer
of the ‘deeds’ or keys of the ‘Kingdom of Osiris’ to Horus by the Great Ennead and Geb.
It seems clear, for example, that this momentous event was thought to
have token place at Ayan, immediately to the north ofMemphis, i.e. about
10 miles or so south of modem Cairo.^’
And as for the dead Osiris, the Shabaka Texts tell us how the god was
taken and buried ‘in the land of Sokar’:
This is the land.. . the burial [place] ofOsiris in the House ofSokar. . . Horus
speaks to Isis and [her sister] Nepthys: ‘Hurry, grasp him . . .’ Isis and
Nepthys speak to Osiris: ‘We come, we take you . . .’ They heeded in time and
brought him to land. He entered the hidden portals in the glory ofthe Lords of
Eternity. Thus Osiris came into the Earth, at the Royal Fortress, to the north
of the land to which he had come. And his son Horus as king of Upper Egypt,
arose as king of Lower Egypt in the embrace of his father Osiris . . .*
Where, what, and whose was the ‘land of Sokar’.?
It turns out to have been an epithet used by the ancient Egyptians to
describe the extensive ‘Memphite necropolis’ incorporating the Pyramid
field of Giza. According to Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, for example: ‘The
dominions of Sokar were situated in the deserts round about Memphis
and were supposed to cover a large extent of territory.’ I. E. S. Edwards



The Clues of Duality 145
tells us that the name ‘Sokar’ was that of ‘the god of the Memphite
necropolis’ - a predynastic deity of the dead - and that ‘by Pyramid times
Osiris had become identified with Sokar’.'*^ R. T. Rundle Clark then further
complicates the picture by speaking of‘Rostau, the modem Giza, the burial
place of Memphis and the home of a form of Osiris known as Sokar’
What confronts us, therefore, appears to be a linked sequence of ideas
involving Osiris, Sokar, the ‘land of Sokar’ (identified with the Memphite
necropolis), and now ‘Rostau’, the ancient Egyptian name for the
Pyramid-field at Giza - a name that is in fact carved in hieroglyphs on the
granite stela, which we encountered in Part I, that stands to this day
between the paws of the Great Sphinx.That same stela also describes
Giza in more general terms as ‘the Splendid Place of the “First Time” ’
and speaks of the Sphinx as standing beside ‘the House of Sokar’.
So the clues on the treasure trail, as well as Osiris, Sokar, the land of
Sokar and Rostau-Giza, now also include the ‘House of Sokar’ and lead us
back towards Zep Tepi, the ‘First Time’.
Bearing all this in mind, let us return for a final look at the Memphite
theology as it is expressed in the Shabaka Texts.
We find Homs firmly in possesion of the earthly ‘Kingdom of Osiris’
(which had of course been founded in the ‘First Time’) and we find the
body of Osiris himself safely installed in ‘the House of Sokar’.^ Under
these ideal conditions, according to the texts, the spritualized form of
Osiris was freed to depart to the sky — and to a specific location in the sky
that we have already identified: ‘the place where Orion is’.'*’ There it was
held that he had established the Duat - the cosmic ‘Otherworld’ on the
right bank of the Milky Way - as a sort of celestial ‘Kingdom ofOsiris’ for
the Dead.'^
Sphinx god
Selim Hassan actually calls the Duat ‘the Kingdom of Osiris’ and shows
how ‘Osiris is styled “Lord of the Duat" and the Osiris-King [i.e. the
deceased Pharaoh] “a companion of Orion” . . He then provides a
piece of incidental information which adds to our trail of clues when he
points out, on the basis of careful textual analysis, that the Duat appears in
some way to be linked to Rostau.^"

38. The passageways, chambers and corridors ofthe ‘land ofSokar’ in the Fifth Division ofthe
««/■ as depicted on tomb walls bear a close resemblance to the passageways, chambers and
corndorsofdje Great Pyramid. CouldoneofthefunctionsofthePyramidhave been to serveas a kind of model or simulation ofthe afterworld in which initiates underwent trials and ordeals?



The Clues of Duality 147
Like other commentators, Hassan acknowledges that ‘the name of
Rostau is applied to the Giza necropolis’/’ But he also, at various points,
defines Rostau as ‘the Kingdom of Osiris in the tomb’,’^ and as ‘the
Memphite Underworld’ — i.e. the Memphite Duat}^ In this context he
examines the so-called twelve ‘Divisions’ (or ‘Hours’) of the Book ofWhat
is in the Duat and shows that references to the ‘land of Sokar’ appear in this
text. Indeed, to be a little more specific, he draws our attention to a most
intriguing fact. The land of Sokar occupies the Fifth Division ofthe Duat^*
and; ‘The centre of the Fifth Division [is] called Rostau.’”
So Egyptologists do not dispute that we have a Rostau on the ground in
the form ofthe Pyramid-field at Giza and a Rostau in the sky in the form of
the Fifth Division of the Duat - a place, as the reader will recall, that was
not seen as an ‘Underworld’ by the ancient Egyptians but rather as a
specific celestial location in Orion.
Furthermore, as we noted in passing in Part I, the passageways,
chambers and corridors of the land of Sokar — amply protrayed on tomb
walls in surviving depictions ofthe Fifth Division of the Duat— uncannily
resemble the passageways, chambers and corridors of the Great Pyramid
of Giza. Indeed the resemblance is so close that it is permissible to wonder
whether one of the functions of the Pyramid may have been to serve as a
kind of model or ‘simulation’ of the afterworld in which initiates
underwent trials and ordeals intended to prepare them intellectually and
spiritually for the terrifying experiences and judgements that the soul was
believed to confront after death.
Here, perhaps, was the testing ground for the ancient Egyptian ‘science
of immortality’ elaborated in every utterance and vignette of the principal
funerary and rebirth texts - the purpose of which was to facilitate the
journey of the soul through the daunting traps and pitfalls of the Duat.
Additional food for thought in this regard is provided by Selim Hassan
who does not neglect to mention that one of the distinguishing features of
the Fifth Division ofthe Duat is the presence there of a giant ‘double-lion’
Sphinx-god named Aker, who seemingly protects the ‘Kingdom of
Sokar’.” Hassan also points out that ‘above Aker in this scene is a large
Pyramid’.” He says that this symbolism, when put in ‘conjunction with
Aker in Sphinx form and the name of Rostau’, suggests that ‘the Fifth
Division was originally a [complete] version of the Duat and had its
geographical counterpart in the Giza necropolis’.”

In support of this idea, Hassan then refers us to another of the ancient
als ^ f Dwelling Place of Osiris’ and also of Osins who is in the Highland of Aker’.” Hassan suggests that



The Clues of Duality 149
‘highland of Aker’ may be a reference to the Giza plateau, ‘where is the
earthly Rostau’.“ Exactly the same idea occurred to the American
Egyptologist Mark Lehner in his 1974 pamphlet, The Egyptian Heritage!'^
Here, after completing a study of Rostau, he wrote: ‘it is tempting to see
the lion figures of Aker as a representation of the Sphinx at Giza.’“
Roads of Rostau
The Book ofTwo Ways is a text that was copied onto the floors and sides of
coffins over a 250-year span (2050-1800 Bc) during the Middle Kingdom.
According to the archaeo-astronomer Jane B. Sellers it was designed ‘to
aid the soul of the deceased to pass along the roads to Rostau, the Gate in
the necropolis which gives access to the “Passages of the Nether¬
world” . .
The related Coffin Texts (2134-1783 Bc) shed further light on the
matter when they state:
I have passed over the paths ofRostau, whether on water or on land, and these
are the paths of Osiris, they are [also] in the limit of the sky . .
I am Osiris; I have come to Rostau to know the secrets of the Duat. .
I shall not be turned back at the gates of the Duat; I ascend to the sky with
Orion ... I am one who collects his efflux in front of Rostau . .
As Sellers points out, many ancient Egyptian texts insist ‘that the
topography of Rostau, though in the sky, is on water and on land.’ She
also proposes that ‘the paths by way of water’ could have been in that area
of the sky that ‘we know as the Milky Way’.“ This idea seems highly
plausible when we remember that the ‘cosmic address’ of the Duat is the
‘Kingdom of Osiris in Orion’ on the right bank of the Milky Way. The
logic of ancient Egyptian duality therefore suggests that ‘the paths by way
of land’ should be found at the earthly Rostau.
The earthly Rostau is the Giza necropolis,^’ site of the three Pyramids
and the Sphinx - so with all this talk of sky-ground dualities it would be
almost perverse to ignore the four narrow ‘star-shafts’ which emanate
skywards from the King’s and Queen’s Chambers inside the Great
Pyramid.
The reader will recall that the southern shaft ofthe King’s Chamber was
directed at around 2500 BC to the centre of the constellation of Orion - i.e.
to Orion’s belt at its ‘culmination’ or ‘meridian transit’ 45 degrees above

dawn on the summer solstice - crucial, at any rate, to the ancient Egyptians
of the Pyramid Age - computer simulations indicate that Orion was seen
not at the meridian but in the south-east, i.e. far to the left of the point in
the sky targeted by the southern shaft of the King’s Chamber.
Looking at the simulation, everything seems out ofkilter - dislocated
and one has the uncomfortable feeling that the stars of Orion’s belt need
somehow to be drawn round to the south, and specifically to the meridian,
so that they can interlock with the shaft that targets them.
We suspect that for the ancient Egyptians this curious and unsettling
‘dislocation’ ofthe sky served as the stimulus for an esoteric journey which
was imdertaken on the ground by the Pharaohs themselves following
celestial clues.
As we shall see in subsequent chapters their quest may have been for
something of immense importance. But in order to understand why, we
must first find out who the Sphinx is.



Chapter 9
The Sphinx and its Horizons
‘The Sphinx has a Genesis, and that was the
lion . .
Egyptologist Selim Hassan, The Sphinx,
Cairo 1949
‘[The constellation of] Leo resembles the
animal after which it is named. A right
triangle of stars outline the back legs ... the
front of the constellation, like a giant
backward question mark, defines the head,
mane, and front legs. At the base of the
question mark is Regulus, the heart of the
lion . . .’
Nancy Hathaway, Friendly Guide to the
Universe, NY 1994
Even a casual review of the religious texts of the ancient Egyptians leaves
no doubt that they regarded their earthly environment as a sacred
landscape which they had inherited from the gods. It was their absolute
conviction that in the remote golden age called the ‘First Time’ Osiris had
established a sort of‘cosmic kingdom’ in the Memphite region which had
been passed on to his son Horus and thence through him, down the cycles
of the epochs, to subsequent generations of human ‘Horus-Kings’ - i.e. to
the living Pharaohs of Egypt.
We have seen that the essence ofthis sacred ‘Kingdom ofOsiris’ was the
peculiar dualism with which it was connected to an area of the sky known
as the Dual, close to Orion and Sirius on the western side of the Milky
Way. We have also seen how the centre of the Dual was called Rostau and



The Sphinx and its Horizons 153
how Rostau, too, existed in both cosmic and terrestrial realms: in the
heavens it was characterized by the three stars of Orion’s belt and on earth
by the three great Pyramids of Giza. Last but not least, we have seen how
the ancient Egyptians of the Pyramid Age particularly observed the Duat
as it lay along the eastern horizon in the pre-dawn at the time of the
summer solstice.
The important word here is ‘horizon’. It will prove to be the key to the
mystery of who — or what - the Great Sphinx really represents.
Celestial reflections
With the aid of computer simulations, and a little imagination, let us
journey to the epoch of2500 bc, when the Pyramid Texts were compiled,
and set our location at Heliopolis on the observatory platform of the
astronomer priests. The time of year is the summer solstice, the moment
ofobservation is the pre-dawn, and we are looking in the general direction
of the eastern horizon. This means that we have our backs turned to the
Giza Pyramids which lie across the Nile some twelve miles to our west.
Looking east also means that we are looking at the Duat. And as our
computer reconstructs the skies our eyes are drawn to that region of the
Duat known as Rostau which manifests the celestial counterparts of the
three great Pyramids - the three stars of Orion’s belt glimmering in the
pre-dawn.
Having registered this image we set our direction towards the west,
towards the Pyramids. The bodies of the distant monuments are still
cloaked in darkness but the first hint of the rising sun lights up their
capstones with an astral glimmer . . .
So we can see that there is a sense in which the Giza necropolis is itselfa
kind of‘horizon’ - i.e. that its three pyramids form a reflection in the west
of the three ‘stars of Rostau’ that observers in 2500 bc would have seen on
the eastern horizon of Heliopolis in the pre-dawn at the summer solstice.
Perhaps this is precisely what was meant by an otherwise cryptic
inscription on the granite stela between the paws of the Sphinx which
speaks of Giza not only as the ‘Splendid Place of the “First Time” ’ as we
have seen, but also as the ‘Horizon of Heliopolis in the West’.*



154 Duality
Astronomer-priests
When the Pyramid Texts were compiled in the epoch of 2500 bc, the
religious centre of the Pharaonic state was at Heliopolis - the ‘City of the
Sun’, called On or Innu by the ancients, which now lies completely buried
under the A1 Matareya suburb of modern Cairo.^ Heliopolis was the
earliest cult centre ofthe sun-god Re in his form zsAtum, the ‘Father ofthe
Gods’. The Heliopolitan priests were high initiates in the mysteries of the
heavens and their dominant occupation was the observation and recording
of the various motions of the sun and the moon, the planets and the stars.^
Much leads us to conclude that they benefited from a vast heritage of
experience based on such observations, accumulated over enormously
long periods of time. At any rate, the ancient Greek and Roman scholars
who were at least two millennia closer to the ancient Egyptians than we are
today — were constantly in awe at the high knowledge and wisdom of the
Heliopolitan and Memphite priests and especially of their astronomical science.
For example, as early as the fifth century bc, Herodotus (the so-called
‘Father ofHistory’) displayed great reverence for the priests ofEgypt and
attributed to them the discovery of the solar year and the invention of the
twelve signs of the zodiac - which he says the Greeks later borrowed. ‘In
my opinion,’ he wrote, ‘their method of calculation is better than that of the Greeks.’ ^
In the fourth century bc the learned Aristotle - who was tutor to
Alexander the Great - similarly recognized that the Egyptians were
advanced astronomers ‘whose observations have been kept for very many
years past, and from whom much of our evidence about particular stars is derived’.’
Plato, too, relates how the Egyptian priests observed the stars ‘for
10,000 years or, so to speak, for an infinite time’.' Likewise Diodorus of
Sicily, who visited Egypt in 60 bc, insisted that ‘the disposition ofthe stars
as well as their movements have always been the subject of careful
observations among the Egyptians’ and that ‘they have preserved to this
day records concerning each of these stars over an incredible number of years . . .’’
Perhaps most significantly ofall, the Lycian Neoplatonist, Proclus, who
studied at Alexandria in the fifth century ad, confirmed that it was not the
Greeks but the Egyptians who discovered the phenomenon ofPrecession:



The Sphinx and its Horizons 155
‘Let those, who believe in observations, cause the stars to move around the
poles of the zodiac by one degree in one hundred years [meaning the
Precession rate] towards the east, as Ptolemy and Hipparchus did before
him know . . . that the Egyptians had already taught Plato about the
movement of the fixed stars . . *
Modem historians and Egyptologists, who are unanimous in the view
that the Egyptians were poor astronomers,’ choose to discount such
statements as frivolous outcries by misinformed Greeks and Romans.
These same scholars all do accept, however, that the priestly centre at
Heliopolis was already remotely ancient at the dawn of the Pyramid Age
and that it had been sacred since time immemorial to the supreme deity
named Atum, the ‘Self-Created’.'”
So who or what exactly was Atum?
Living image of Atum
Addressing the first annual meeting of the prestigious Egypt Exploration
Fund on 3 July 1883, the eminent Swiss Egyptologist Edouard Naville
had this to say about Atum: ‘there can be no doubt that the lion or the
sphinx is a form of Atum . . "
Naville went on to cite what he considered as sufficient evidence for
such a conclusion:
I will cite only one proof, this is the deity Nefer-Atum. This deity can be
represented with the head of a lion . . . normally he has a human form, and
wears on his head a lotus from which emerge two straight plumes. Sometimes
the two emblems [lion and human] are united and between the head ofthe lion
and the plume there is the bird [hawk] of Horus.'^
Though initially a confusing element, we shall see that the hawk
symbolism of Horus crops up frequently in connection with this mystery
and gradually begins to take its place in the overall pattern that will
emerge. Meanwhile, much else confirms that Atum, the primordial
creator god, was regarded by the ancient Egyptians as being primarily
leonine or sphinx-like in form.
In the Pyramid Texts, for example, we frequently encounter the
designation Rwty^ normally translated as the ‘double-lion’'^ because the
hieroglyphic sign shows two lions either side by side or one above the
other.''' It is generally accepted, however, that a finer meaning for the term



156 Duality
is ‘the creature who has the form of a lion’ or ‘he who reseriibles the lion’,
and that the significance of the double-lion hieroglyph is that it
emphasizes the dual and cosmic nature of Rwty}^ The Egyptologist Le
Page Renouf wrote that Rwty represents ‘a single god with a lion’s face or
form’,’^ And for Selim Hassan '"Rwty was a god in the form of a lion’. In
Hassan s view the choice ofthe double-Kon hieroglyph was very probably
linked in some way to the fact that: ‘sphinxes are always found in pairs
when guarding temple door-ways, and the function ofRwty is also that ofa guardian.’*’
Moreover, in fine 2032 ofthe Pyramid Texts, as Hassan points out: ‘it is
said ofthe King: “He is taken to Rwty and presented to Atum”. . . [and] in
the so-called Book ofthe Dead... it says (Ch. 3, line 1): “O Atum, who
appears as master of the lake, who shines as Rwty''. . .’**
Indeed, there are many such places in the texts where Rwty and Atum
are finked. One typical passage states: ‘O Atum, spiritualize me in the
presence ofRwty . . .’*’ And elsewhere we read: ‘Lift up this king’s double
to the god, lead him to Rwty, cause him to mount up to Atum . . . The
King’s rank is high in the Mansion of Rwty.' “
Such syncretism with Rwty strongly supports a ‘lion-like’ or ‘sphinx
like appearance for Atum. We should therefore not be surprised to
discover that in ancient Egyptian religious art Atum is often depicted as a
sphinx wearing the characteristic headgear ofthis god - a tall crown with a
plume and lotus.’* From such depictions many leading Egyptologists have
concluded that the Great Sphinx at Giza, though allegedly bearing the
face of Khafre, may also have been regarded as an image of Atum.”
Indeed, as we saw in Part I, one of the most enduring ofthe many titles by
which the Sphinx was known to the ancient Egyptians was Sheshep-ankh
Atum (literally ‘living image of Atum’)” - so we need be in little doubt
about this identification.
Atum, Re and Horakhti
Despite all of Atum’s well-known Lion-Sphinx characteristics, modem
Egyptologists have a tendency to ignore his intense leonine symbolism
when discussing his cosmic attributes. More often than not they confine
themselves to dishing out certain vague generalities to the effect that Atum
was the ‘sun-god and creator of the universe’, and that his name:



The Sphinx and its Horizons 157
. . carries the idea of “totality” in the sense of an ultimate and
unalterable state of perfection. Atum is frequently called “The Lord of
Heliopolis”, the major centre of sun worship. The presence of another
solar deity on this site, Re, leads to a coalescence of the two gods into Re
Atum . .
Egyptologist Rosalie David informs us that at the opening of the
Pyramid Age ‘the god Re [or Ra] had taken over the cult of an earlier god
Atum . . . [thus] Re-Atum was now worshipped as the creator of the world
according to the Heliopolitan theology, and his priests sought to
distinguish his various characteristics’.^^
One of these important characteristics, Davies adds, was Re’s manifes
tion as ''Re-HorakhtPSince the literal meaning of Horakhti is “Horus
of-the-Horizon”,^’ it would seem that what we are to envisage in this latest
piece ofancient Egyptian syncretism is a coalescence of the sun’s disc with
such a deity. Furthermore, as astronomers and astrologers are well aware,
the disc of the sun does, in fact, ‘coalesce’ with (or ‘enter the house’ of)
certain star groups - the twelve constellations of the zodiac - at regular
intervals throughout the year. So it is reasonable to wonder whether
‘Horus-of-the-Horizon’ i.e. Horakhti, could in fact be one of these
zodiacal constellations.
The Egyptologist Hermann Kees also gave consideration to the
subjects of Heliopolis and Horakhti. In the light ofwhat is about to follow,
his remarks are extremely relevant: ‘The particular worship peculiar to
Heliopolis was that of the stars. From the worship of the stars evolved the
worship of Re in the form of‘Horus-of-the-Horizon . . .’“
We suggest that this conclusion is in the main correct, though not quite
in the manner Kees saw it. We believe that it was not merely from a general
‘worship of the stars’ but rather from an ancient stellar image - that of a
specific zodiacal constellation - that the composite deity Re-Horakhti was
derived.
Horakhti is represented in ancient Egyptian reliefs as a man with a
hawk’s head, on top of which rests the solar disc.^’ In this way both the god
Horus (symbolized by the hawk) and the sun in the ‘horizon’ are identified
with the Pharaoh-King - regarded as the living embodiment of Horus.
The Orientalist Lewis Spence noted additionally that the lion ‘was
identified to the solar deities, with the sun-god Horus [and] Re’.^’
Frequently, too, we find composite lion-hawk representations ofthe King

in ancient depictions. For example, there is a relieffrom the sun-temple of
Pharaoh Sahure at Abusir (Fifth Dynasty, circa 2350 bc) which shows the
King as a winged lion and also as a lion with a hawk’s head.^^
In summary, therefore, we seem to be looking at the various symbolic
expressions of a lengthy process: in prehistoric times a primordial god,
Atum, whose form was the lion or the Sphinx, was worshipped by the
Heliopolitan priests; then, in the Pyramid Age, Atum was ‘coalesced’ with
Re, whose form was the sun’s disc, and finally with Hawk-headed
Horakhti - Horus-of-the-Horizon - symbolizing the Horus-King.
The result was the syncretized deity Atum-Re-Horakhti whose com¬
bined symbolism originated from the leonine or Sphinx-like image of
Atum. Somehow this composite or ‘coalesced’ image was then made
manifest in the ‘Horizon’ in the early Pyramid Age.
In that epoch, as the reader will recall, the focus of the astronomer
priests was on the summer solstice, when the Duat was active in the eastern
sky. In what zodiacal sign, seen on the eastern horizon, did this all
important ‘coalescence’ take place.?



i6o Duality
Horus, Dweller-in-the-Horizon
When Edouard Naville was excavating certain New Kingdom remains in
Egypt’s delta region north of Cairo in 1882—3, he was struck by the fact
that a large number of the monuments he uncovered were dedicated to a
composite deity he called ^Atutn-Harmarchis'. Associated with these
monuments there would always be a naos^ or sanctuary, containing ‘a
sphinx with a human head’ which Naville states was ^a well-known form of
the god Harmarchis’.”
We are by now familiar with Atum. But who is this ‘Harmarchis’?
Naville noted that in addition to his Sphinx form he was often represented
as ‘a god with a hawk’s head, or as a hawk with a solar disc’ - symbols with
which we are also familiar — and that ‘’Atum-Harmachis was the god of
Heliopolis, the most ancient city of Egypt’/'*
Harmachis is a Graecianized rendering of the ancient Egyptian name,
Hor-em-Akhet, which means ‘Horus-in-the-Horizon’ or ‘Horus-Dweller
in-the-Horizon . In other words, as should be obvious by now, it is a
concept that is extremely close to Horakhti, or ‘Horus-o/the Horizon’ - as
close, at any rate, as the nuance between ‘of’ on the one hand and ‘in’ on the other . . .
Both deities are called horizon-dwellers. Both are sometimes depicted
as a man with the head of a hawk. Both have a solar disc on their heads.^^
Indeed there is no real difference between them at all except, as we shall
see, in the nature of the ‘Horizon’ in which they are said to dwell.
There is one other thing about Hor-em-Akhet and Horakhti, however,
that we need to take account of first. The names of these curiously
composite and syncretized lion-hawk-solar deities were both frequently,
directly and interchangeably applied to the Great Sphinx at Giza.
The ‘Two Horizons’ of Heliopolis
The earliest surviving references to Hor-em-Akhet date from the New
Kingdom, area 1440 BC, and are found on a limestone stela of Pharaoh
Amenhotep II, the builder of a small temple that can still be seen on the
north side of the Sphinx enclosure. On the stela Amenhotep makes
reference to the ‘Pyramids ofHor-em-Ahket’ which SeUm Hassan takes as



The Sphinx and its Horizons i6i
a sign, ‘that he considered the Sphinx to be older than the Pyramids’.^’
Hassan also notes that the stela specifically names the Great Sphinx both
as Hor-em-Akhet and as Horakhti.^*
In a similar vein, in line 9 of its inscription, the granite stela of
Thutmosis IV - which stands between the paws of the Sphinx - refers to
the Sphinx itself as ^Hor-em-Akhet-Khepri-Re-Atum\ and subsequently,
in line 13, as ^Atum-Hor-em-Akhef^^ but also refers to Thutmosis as the
‘Protector of Horakhti’."^ And it is on this same stela, as the reader will
recall, that Giza is described as ‘the “Horizon” \Akhei\ ofHeliopolis in the
West’ - i.e. as a ‘reflection’ in the West ofwhat viewers in Heliopolis would
have seen on their eastern horizon in the pre-dawn ofthe summer solstice.
It may also be of relevance that the son of Thutmosis IV, Amenhotep
III, is remembered in ancient Egyptian annals as having built a temple in
honour of Re-Horakhti, and that Amenhotep’s son, the notorious and
enigmatic Pharaoh Akhenaten, raised a great obelisk at Luxor in honour of
Re-Hor-em-Akhet.‘‘‘ Akhenaten was also to name his famous solar-city
AkhetAten, the ‘Horizon ofthe sun disc’."*^ And as Selim Hassan points out
the Aten or sun disc was frequently identified by the ancient Egyptians
with the image of the Sphinx.'*^ Last but not least, when Akhenaten
ascended the throne of Egypt he chose as his most prominent epithet the
impressive title of‘High priest of Re-Horakhti



162 Duality
It is therefore legitimate to inquire into what exactly is meant by the
term ‘Horizon’ (Akhet) in the names Hor-em-Akhet and Horakhti. Are
these twin beings known as Horus-in-the-Horizon and Horus-of-the
Horizon to be associated with the celestial horizon - where sky meets land?
Or are they to be associated with the ‘Horizon’ of Heliopolis in the West,
i.e. the Giza necropolis?
Or is it not more likely that the texts are prompting us to consider two
‘horizons’ at the same time?
Interestingly, Egyptologists often translate the names Hor-em-Akhet
and Horakhti as meaning ‘Horus-of-the-Two-Horizons’. Sir E. A. Walhs
Budge, for example, identifies Re-Horakhti to Re-Harmachis [Hor-em
Akhet] and translates both names as ‘Ra + Horus-of-the-Two-Hori
zons’/^ Likewise the orientalist Lewis Spence writes: ‘Horus-of-the
Two-Horizons, the Harmachis [Hor-em-Akhet] ofthe Greeks, was one of
chief forms of the sun-god . . . thus we find Harmachis worshipped
principally at Heliopolis ... his best-known monument is the famous
Sphinx, near the Pyramids of Giza.’ ^
So if Hor-em-Akhet is the Great Sphinx in the western ‘Horizon of
Giza’, then should we not look for Horakhti, his ‘twin’, in the eastern
horizon of the sky?
These are questions that we shall continue to pursue. Meanwhile, as
Egyptologist Ahmed Fakhry confirms, the various stelae that we have
reviewed, and numerous other inscriptions, leave no doubt that the
Pharaohs of ancient Egypt knew and worshipped the Sphinx (and
obviously, too, his celestial counterpart) under the names Hor-em-Akhet
and Horakhti.'^’ Fakhry also points out something else of relevance: both
names are ‘appropriate’ since ‘the ancient necropolis [of Giza] was called
Akhet Khufu, the “Horizon” of Khufu’.'^
Strange silence
Because the earliest surviving texts containing the term Hor-em-Akhet
date from the New Kingdom, it is the present consensus of scholars that
the ancient Egyptians of the Old BCingdom never spoke of the Sphinx.
According to Jaromir Malek of Oxford University, for example: ‘Old



The Sphinx and its Horizons 163
Kingdom sources are strangely and surprisingly silent about the Great
Sphinx of Giza. It was only some 1000 years after the Sphinx had been
made . . . that it was mentioned . .
Could this really be so.? How could the Old Kingdom Egyptians, having
taken the trouble to construct the huge Giza necropolis and the rest of the
Memphite monuments, fail to make any mention of the Great Sphinx.?
One possibility which deserves to be taken seriously is that they did not
mention it because they did not build it - but rather inherited it from a far
earlier epoch. Even on this scenario, however, it strains credulity to
suppose, in all their prolific texts, carved on the walls of nine royal
Pyramids of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties, that they would not make a
single reference to so magnificent a statue occupying so crucial a site.
The other possibility which has to be considered, therefore, is that
Egyptologists could somehow have failed to recognize the name given to
the Sphinx in the Pyramid Texts.
There is one very obvious contender.
As we have seen, the Sphinx in the New Kingdom was known not only
as Hor-em-Akhet but also as Horakhti. And although the name Hor-em
Akhet definitely does not appear in the Pyramid Texts it is a simple fact
that the name Horakhti does, many times over. Indeed these archaic
scriptures contain hundreds of direct mentions of Horakhti, ‘Horus-of
the-HorizonV” all ofwhich refer, as scholars agree, ‘to the god rising in the
east at dawn’.^* What they have never suspected is the possibility that they
may be confronted here by the ancient Egyptian dualistic way of referring
to an earthly counterpart by means of its celestial twin.
Searching for Horakhti
‘The doors of the sky are thrown open for Horakhti,’ states one typical
passage in the Pyramid Texts, ‘the doors of the sky are thrown open at
dawn for Homs ofthe East. . Elsewhere, in line 928, we read: ‘go to. . .
Horakhti at the horizon ... I go up on this eastern side of the sky . . .’”
Virtually unnoticed by Egyptologists, who write off all such utterances
as ‘mystical mumbo-jumbo’, the Pyramid Texts also provide us with some
extremely important astronomical clues when they tell us, again and again.



164 Duality
that the dawn rising of Horakhti in the east coincides with the time and
place ‘where the gods were bom’. For example:
The Winding Waterway is flooded, the Fields of Rushes are filled, that I may
be ferried over to the eastern side of the sky, to the place where the gods were
born, and I was born there with them, as Horus, as the Horizon Dweller [Horakhti] . .
go to. .. Horakhti at the horizon... on the eastern side ofthe sky where the gods are born.“
... the birth of the gods before you [Horus] in the five epagomenal days. .
Making use ofthe proper astronomical key, let us try to decode this alleged ‘mystical mumbo-jumbo’:
1 The place where the gods [i.e. the stars] are bom’ is a specific
direction as to where we are to observe Horakhti: the eastern horizon - where all heavenly bodies rise.
2 The time of year at which we are to make our observations is also
clearly specified: the so-called ‘five epagomenal days’, or five ‘days
upon the year . To understand this reference we need only remember
that the ancient Egyptian calendar was based on 360 days plus five
extra or intercalcary days which they called ‘the days upon the year’
{epagomenae in Greek). During these five days five Neters or gods
were said to have been bom, two of whom - Osiris and Isis - were
identified by the ancient Egyptians with the constellation of Orion and the star Sirius (also called Sothis).
3 Last but not least the Pyramid Texts also specify the time of day at
which the sky is to be observed - clearly dawn, since this was when
the birth of the gods was said to have occurred:
Behold Osins has come as Orion ... the dawn-light bears you with Orion . . . your third is Sothis [Sirius] . . ”
Sothis [Sinus] is swallowed up [i.e. fades in the dawn] by the Duat pure and living in the Horizon.’® ’ ^
The reed-floats of the sky are brought down to me . . . that I may go up
on thein to Horakhti at the horizon. I go up on this eastern side of the sky
where the gods are born, and I am born as Horus, as ‘Him of the Horizon’ . . . Sothis is my [companion]. .
The sky is clear [is lighting up], Sothis lives . .
‘Yelp ‘ sustenance for you in her name of



The Sphinx and its Horizons 165
Geographical and cosmological context
The day on which Sothis-Sirius, after a period ofinvisibility, was first seen
rising with the sun at dawn (i.e. the event referred to by astronomers as the
‘heliacal rising’ of this star) was taken by the ancient Egyptians as the
cosmic marker for the beginning of their New Year.
Furthermore it is certain from the passages quoted above, and from
many other references in the Pyramid Texts, that the dawn rising of
Sothis-Sirius coincided with the rising of‘Horakhti’. This is an important
piece ofastronomical information which helps us to identify who Horakhti
is - or rather which celestial figure he represents.
We also know from historical records and from computer reconstruc¬
tions that two major events - one celestial and the other terrestrial
coincided with the heliacal rising of Sirius during the Pyramid Age {circa
2500 Bc). The celestial event was the summer solstice. And the terrestrial
event, as the reader will recall from the previous chapter, was the start of
the Nile’s annual flood - the ‘Great Inundation’ that brought fertility to
the land.“
Once this geographical and cosmological context is fully taken into
account we can see exactly what it is that the compilers of the Pyramid
Texts were transposing from the ground to the sky when they tell us that
the appearance ofHorakhti at dawn coincided in their epoch with the start
of the ‘great flood’:
The Winding Waterway is flooded, that I may be ferried thereon to the
horizon, to Horakhti... Re has taken me to himself, to the sky, to the eastern
side of the sky, as this Horns, as the Dweller in the Dual, as this star which
illumines the sky [which] is my sister Sothis . . .“
This is Homs who came forth from the Nile . .
They row Horns, they row Homs in the procession of Homs on the Great
Flood. The doors ofthe sky are opened, the doors ofthe firmament are thrown
open for Homs of the East at dawn . .
Also passage 1172 speaks of‘the Great Flood which is in the sky’ in the
region of the Duat.
So, to summarize, far from being ‘mumbo-jumbo’, the Pyramid Texts
go to great lengths to make it clear that during the epoch of their
compilation, circa 2500 BC, the rising of Horakhti at dawn coincided with
the summer solstice, and with the season ofthe inundation, at the moment
when the Duat - the celestial Kingdom of Osiris-Orion - occupied the



166 Duality
eastern portion of the sky. We can also deduce from the texts that Re, i.e.
the sun’s disc, was seen somehow to merge or to unite - or ‘coalesce’ - with
Horakhti at the same time. This is made amply clear by the following
reading. Re has taken me to himself to the eastern side of the sky as this
Horus, as the “Dweller in the Duaf\^
In other words, what we need to look for in order to identify Horakhti
with certainty is an astronomical conjunction during the summer solstice
in the Pyramid Age when both the sun and some other significant celestial
body would have been seen to occupy the same specific place on the eastern horizon.
As we shall see in the next chapter, computer simulations provide us
with the means to search for such a conjunction. They also enable us to
relive the drama of the Horus-BCings of ancient Egypt as they participated

Chapter lo
The Quest of the Horus-King
‘Egypt. . . considered life to be everlasting
and denied the reality of death ... Pharaoh
was not mortal but a god. This was the
fundamental concept of Egyptian kingship,
that Pharaoh was of divine essence, a god
incarnated ... It is wrong to speak of the
deification of Pharaoh. His divinity was not
proclaimed at a certain moment in a manner
comparable to the concretatio of the dead
emperor by the Roman senate. His
coronation was not an apotheosis but an
epiphany.’
Henri Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods, 1948
‘The figure of Osiris is not exclusively at
home in mythology ... Each king, at death,
becomes Osiris, just as each king, in life,
appears “on the throne of Horns”; each king
is Horus . .. The question whether Osiris
and Horus are . . . gods or kings is, for the
Egyptian, meaningless. These gods are the
late king and his successor; these kings are
those gods ...’
Henri Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods, 1948
The whole force, the impetus and the very raison d'etre of the Pharaonic
state was to provide all the required ceremonial settings that would enable
the Horus-King to undertake a sort of supernatural quest - a journey back
in time into the earthly and cosmic realms ofhis ‘father’ Osiris. Indeed this
was the supreme quest in a Pharaoh’s lifetime and at its end lay the
ultimate Holy Grail in the form ofthe astral body of Osiris which the king

could encounter only after overcoming many dangers, difficulties and
ordeals and after passing through many miracles and terrors. Once in the
presence of Osiris the questor would beseech him to ‘rise again’ and
bestow immortality not only on himself, but on the whole land of Egypt.
This great ritual had to be performed by each successive Horus-King,
(perhaps even each year) at a specific time preluding the ‘rising of Orion’.
Child of the Sun, son of Osiris
In his brilliant study on the Osirian cosmic myth,' the late professor of
Egyptology at Manchester University, R. X. Rundle Clark, wrote that:
The king was the mediator between the community and the source of
divine power, obtaining it through the ritual and regularizing it through
his government. In Egypt there were two sources ofpower - in the sky and
m the tomb with the ancestors. The first location made the king the child
of the Sun God; the second location made him Horus, the son of Osiris. . .’^
Let us reiterate this important dualistic quality of the Horus-King
the child of of the Sun God and the son of Osiris’ - for in it hes the true
mystery of the great Osirian and Horian rituals of the Pyramid Age. The
potential powers of nature within the ‘dead’ Osiris remained ‘inert, asleep
or listless, and completely passive’ until the Horus-King was Lble to
undertake a ‘journey’ to the Duat and ‘visit his father’ and ‘open his
mouth’, i.e. bring him back to life.' This final and supreme act of filial
devotion would then release all the forces of nature which would in turn
bring forth the flooding of the Nile and the growth of vegetation — the
forces, in short, that would fertilize and regenerate Egypt. In Rundle
Clark s words: ‘Theologically, the result of Horus’s ministration is that
Osiris can “send out his soul” or “set himself in motion” .-.. The time of
Orion in the southern sky after the time ofits invisibility is the sign for the
beginning of a new season of growth, the revival of nature in all aspects.
Osiris has been transformed into a “living soul”
Sir E. A. Wallis Budge also explains how, from its earliest beginnings,
the Pharaonic state was entirely committed to provide the correct
ceremonial setting for each successive Horus-King to be able to perform
the ‘journey’ into the Duat to visit the twofold realm of Osiris in the ‘horizon’:



The Quest of the Horus-King 169
[The Egyptians] spared no pains in performing the works which they thought
would help themselves and their dead to put on immortality and to arrive in
the dominions of him who was ‘the King of eternity and the lord of
everlastingness’. Every tradition which existed concerning the ceremonies
that were performed on behalf of the dead Osiris by Horus and his ‘sons’ and
‘followers’, at some period which even so far back as the IVth Dynasty . . . was
extremely remote, was carefully preserved and faithfully imitated under
succeeding dynasties . . . The formulae which were declared to have been
recited during the performance of such ceremonies were written down and
copied for scores of generations . . *
The whole emphasis on the King’s person, therefore, was that he was seen
as the link between the two Duals, one in the sky and the other on land,
both meant to contain the ‘Kingdom of Osiris’ as it was in the original
‘First Time’. The great ‘journeys’ ofHorus thus took place both in the sky
and on the ground and ran, as it were, in parallel. This is how the drama
seems to have been conceived:
1 In the sky the Horus-King was the ‘son of the Sun’ and had to follow
the path of the sun disc, cross the ‘cosmic river’ on the Solar-bark
and reach the Gateway that lead into the sky-Duat of his ‘father
Osiris’ in the eastern horizon.^ He then had to travel on one of the
‘roads’ to Rostau, the centre of the Dual, where (then and now) are to
be found the three stars of Orion’s belt.
2 On the ground the Horus-King was the bodily ‘son of Osiris’ and had
to follow the earthly path, cross the Nile on the solar boat and reach
the Gateway (the great Sphinx) that led into the t2LXXh-Duat of his
‘father Osiris’ in the western ‘horizon’, i.e. the necropolis of Giza. He
then had to travel on one of the ‘roads’ to Rostau, the centre of the
Dual, where (then and now) are to be found the three great Pyramids
of Giza.
In both these ‘journeys’ the Horus-King somehow had to be able to pass
through a sort of‘time gateway’ which permitted him to enter the twofold
Dual realms of Osiris - i.e. Rostau-Giza - as they were remembered from
the mythical golden age of the gods:
[The council says to Horus]: Indeed this journey of yours ... is as when [the
first] Horus went to his father Osiris so that he might be a spirit thereby, that
he might be a soul thereby . . Indeed this journey ofyours, indeed these journeys ofyours [sky and land]
are the journeys of [the first] Horus in search of his father Osiris .. .*



170 Duality
From such references it is quite obvious that the events catalogued in the
sky and on the land in the ‘twofold funeral regions of Osiris’ are somehow
set or ‘fro2en’ far back in the past in ‘the time of the gods’, the time of
Osiris and Horus — i.e. Zep Tepi, the ‘First Time’.
Also obvious, as we have seen in previous chapters, is the way in which
the twofold funeral regions of Osiris are said to reflect each other at the
time ofthe heliacal rising ofSirius, the ‘star ofIsis’, the sister-wife ofOsiris
and mother ofHorus - an astronomical event which we know coincided in
the early Pyramid Age with the appearance ofthe rising sun at the summer
solstice (known as the ‘birth ofRe’).^ It was at this propitious moment that
the Horus-King set out on his quest for the regeneration of Egypt by
participating in a grand rebirth ritual simultaneously as the ‘son of Osiris’ and the ‘son of Re’.
As the ‘son of Osiris’ he emerged from ‘the womb of Isis’, i.e. the star
Sirius,*® at dawn on the summer solstice, i.e. the day ofthe ‘Birth ofRe’. It
was then - and there - both at the sky-horizon and on the earth ‘horizon’
that the Horus-King was meant to find himself in front of the Gateway to
Rostau. Guarding that Gateway on the earth-horizon’ (i.e. at Giza) he
would encounter the gigantic figure of a lion - the Great Sphinx. And
guarding that Gateway in the sky-horizon his celestial counterpart would find . . . what.^
As usual, once we understand their profoundly astronomical nature, the
Pyramid Texts provide us with all the necessary co-ordinates to answer
this question. It is simply a matter of realizing that the ‘weird’ symbolic
language used in the texts — far from being mumbo-jumbo — is in fact a
precise scientific terminology dressed up in the liturgical clothing of a cosmic drama.'*
Seventy days from Horakhti
It is well known, and not a matter of controversy even amongst
Egyptologists,*^ that the whole emphasis of the ancient Egyptian rebirth
cult was on the seventy days of‘invisibility’ which Sirius, the star of Isis,
endured each year. These seventy days were seen as a cosmic preparation
for astral rebirth and, not surprisingly, they were matched to the period of
embalming in the mummification rituals of the dead.*' The culmination
and crescendo of this seventy-day period came with the first dawn



The Quest of the Horus-King 171
reappearance, or rising, of Sirius which, as the reader will recall, occurred
at around the time of the summer solstice during the Pyramid Age. This
was when the astronomer-priests of Heliopolis observed what is techni¬
cally known as the heliacal rising of Sirius in the east.*'*
Since it was believed that all the potential powers of nature needed to
cause the ‘rebirth’ of the cosmic Horus-King were building up in the
‘womb’ of the goddess Isis during these crucial seventy days, we can
suppose that the beginning of the period marked the beginning of the
‘journey’ ofHorus into the ‘underworld’ - when the Duat was locked, as it
were, below the horizon and thus directly ‘underneath’ the Giza
necropohs.
From this it follows that we are invited to find out where the Horus
King’s celestial counterpart - i.e. the disc of the sun - stood in the sky
some seventy days prior to the hehacal rising ofSirius. The Pyramid Texts
again give us the clue. They specify that at this time the Horus-solar-King
was to be found on the banks of the Milky Way just about to board the
solar bark.'® Remembering that the astronomical observations in the texts
were made during the middle of the third millennium BC, let us try to
decode this imagery using computer simulations.
Seventy days before the Summer Solstice
44. Position ofthe Duat sky-region at dawn at various times ofthe year in the epoch of2500 bc,

mid-June when the stars of Orion and Sirius rose heliacally. Some 70 days prior to this crucial
observational moment the Duat was ‘locked’ below the horizon and thus, in a sense, directly
‘underneath’ the Giza necropolis.



172 Duality
We know, of course, that the ‘path’ of the sun (which astronomers call
the ecliptic) passes through twelve distinct constellations in the course ofa
complete year — the constellations of the zodiac. Circa 2500 BC, therefore,
let us see where the sun would have been along the ecliptic path some
seventy days before the heliacal rising of Sirius. It would, we discover,
have been near the head of Taurus (the Hyades) and poised on the right
bank of the Milky Way.**
In the ritual or drama performed by the king, is it not possible that this
celestial event was the source of the imagery ofthe cosmic Homs about to
board a cosmic bark with the sun-god in order to cross a waterway (the
‘Winding Waterway’, i.e. the Milky Way):*’
The king embarks with Re on this great bark of his, he navigates in it to the horizon with him . . .‘*
The king shall go aboard the bark like Re on the banks of the Winding Waterway ...”
The Winding Waterway is flooded ... you cross thereon to the horizon, to
the place where the gods were bom . .. your sister [companion] is Sothis . !
May you cross the Winding Waterway. . . may you fall in the eastern side of the sky, may you sit in the . . . horizon . .
He [Horns] goes aboard the bark like Re at the banks of the Winding Waterway. .
As we wind the ancient skies a little forward in time on our computer we
discover that twenty-five days after being stationed near the Hyades
Taurus on the right bank of the cosmic river the sun has indeed ‘crossed’
the Milky Way and is now ‘sailing’ eastwards along the ecUptic path in the
direction of the great zodiacal constellation of Leo - seen as a huge
‘crouching lion’ in the sky. We are now just a little over six weeks away
from the summer solstice:
The reed-floats of the sky are set down for me that I may cross on them to the
horizon, to Horakhti ... to yonder eastern side of the sky . . . Summons is
made to me by Re ... as Horus, as the Horizon Dweller . .
The doors of the sky are thrown open for Horakhti... the doors of the sky are thrown open at dawn for Horus of the East. . }*
go to. . . Horakhti at the horizon ... on the eastern side ofthe sky where the gods are born.^^
Following this extremely clear and specific instruction to ‘go to Horakhti’
at the horizon (there to meet the sunrise) we continue our eastward

journey along the ecliptic path with a sense that we are rapidly converging
upon a vital ‘station’ in the quest of the Horus-King.
The weeks pass in seconds on our computer screen and when we at last
‘reach the eastern side of the sky’ — at the horizon, at the highly significant
moment when ‘the gods are bom’, i.e. at the exact time ofrising ofthe star
Sirius - we see that a very powerful celestial conjunction has occurred: the
sun (which is now at the summer solstice point) stands exactly between the
‘paws’ of Leo.“ The solar disc is positioned near the breast of the cosmic
lion where it seems to merge with the bright star Regulus — the ‘star of
Kings’.'’
The great celestial ‘journey’ performed by the cosmic Horus-King
along the ecliptic path therefore turns out to lead quite unambiguously to
one very specific place in the heavenly landscape: between the ‘paws’ of
Leo and right in front of its ‘breast’.
The implications are obvious.
The enigmatic figure of Horakhti, whose identity we have been
attempting to establish, can be none other than the constellation of Leo
the giant cosmic lion, or sphinx, who stands at the gates of the sky-Duat
and who assumes the name of‘Horus-of-the-Horizon’.
Let us now transpose the Horus-King to the land and and follow his
journey to the earthly ‘Horus-in-the-Horizon’ - by whom, of course, we
mean Hor-em-Akhet, the Great Sphinx in the ‘horizon’ of Giza.
The High Road and the Low Road
The Horus-King stands on the east bank of the Nile, near the royal
residence.'* After completing certain rituals he boards a great ‘solar boat’'’
- perhaps the very boat that was found in 1954 buried in a pit near the
south face ofthe Great Pyramid - and is taken to the west bank ofthe river
in the valley beneath the Giza plateau. He disembarks, makes his way up to
the Temple of the Sphinx, and walks between the paws of the great statue
to stand in front of its breast.
He is now at the Gateway to Rostau*® and about to enter the Fifth
Division of the Duat - the holy of holies of the Osirian afterworld
Kingdom. Moreover, he is presented with a choice of‘two ways’ or ‘roads’
to reach Rostau: one which is on ‘land’ and the other in ‘water’.*’

The eminent German philologist, Adolf Erman, explains:
Whoever enters the realms of the dead by the sacred place ofRostau has, as we
learn from a map of the Hereafter, two routes open to him, which would lead
him to the land ofthe blessed, one by water, the other by land. Both are zigzag,
and a traveller cannot change from one to the other, for between them lies a sea
of fire. . . Also before entering upon either ofthese routes there is a gate offire to be passed ..
Having made his choice, the Horus-King demands to be taken to see ‘his
father Osiris in his astral form. A mediator or priest reports to Osiris and states:
It is not I who asks that he may see you in this form of yours which has come
into being for you; O Osiris, someone asks that he may see you in this form of
yours which has come into being for you; it is your son who asks... it is Horus
who asks that he may see you in this form ... a loving son .

magic. I have come that I may glorify Orion, that I may set Osiris at the
head . .
I have come to you, my father, I have come to you, Osiris . .
Next, in a most telling manner, the council ofthe gods issues the following
instruction:
O Horus, the King [your father] is Osiris, this Pyramid of the King is Osiris,
this construction of his is Osiris; betake yourself to it. .
And further light may be shed on the identity of the Osiris-Pyramid by a
passage from the Book of What is in the Duat which speaks of a mysterious
‘district’ in the Duat: ‘which is 440 cubits in length and 440 cubits in



178 Duality
breadth’.^’ Can it be a coincidence, since the Egyptian, royal cubit is
equivalent to 20.6 inches and 440 cubits therefore amounts to just over 755
feet, that the dimensions given are identical to those of the Great
Pyramid’s square base?
At any rate, after passing through more ordeals and adventures, the
questing Horus-King finally reaches Osiris-Orion and finds him listless in
the tenebrous underworld of his Pyramid. At this vital juncture, the
questor s role is to bid his ‘father Osiris’ to awake and be reborn — i.e., in
dualistic astronomical terms, to rise anew in the east at dawn as Orion:
‘Awake for Homs! . . . Raise yourself] . . . The gates of the Dual are
opened for you. . . Spiritualize yourself. . . May a stairway to the Duat be
set up for you to the place where Orion is . . .’
Where, then, near or under the Sphinx can we find the ‘two ways’ or the ‘two roads’ of Rostau?
And why should the Homs-King be made to choose between them?
Subterranean world
One of the ancient names of the Giza necropolis, as we have seen, was
Akhet Khufu - Kherit-Neter-Akhet-Khufu in full, usually rendered into
English as ‘the necropolis of the Horizon of Khufu’. In his dictionary of
ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. Sir E. A. Wallis Budge translates the word
Kherit-Neter as ‘cemetery, necropolis’."" Selim Hassan, however, points
out that Kherit-Neter can have the alternative meaning of ‘under, or
belonging to a God . And Budge adds that Khertt can also mean ‘estate’
and that the root of the word, i.e. Kher, can mean ‘under something’, ‘the
lower part’ or ‘downwards’."^
In addition, as Hassan also reminds us, Kherit ‘may be applied to the
Underworld [Duat], perhaps as a lingering memory of the conception of
Rostau as the Kingdom ofOsiris in the tomb’."' Could such nuances imply
more than a lingering memory? In other words, is it not posible, as we have
already suggested in Part I, that under the necropolis-‘horizon’ of Giza
there could be an ‘estate’ ofsome kind - perhaps a network ofsubterranean chambers and passageways?
In his Handbook ofEgyptian Religion, the German Egyptologist Adolf
Erman wrote that: ‘the celebrated shrine Rostau, the gates ofthe ways, led
directly to the underworld. It is possible that part of this shrine’has



The Quest of the Horus-King 179
survived in the so-called Temple of the Sphinx . .
Furthermore, commenting on the word ‘Rostau’, R. O. Faulkner, the
translator of the Pyramid Texts, says that this is also ‘the term for a ramp
or slide for moving the sarcophagus into a tomb, transferred to a region of
the beyond’/^ Dr I. E. S. Edwards, on the other hand, says that the
causeway which links a pyramid complex with its valley temple ‘was called
“place of the haul” or “entrance of the haul” (Rostau) because it was the
way along which sledges bearing the body of the dead king and his
personal possessions would be hauled at his funeral’.
Linking the Valley Temple near the Sphinx with the central Pyramid
on the Giza plateau, as the reader will recall, are the remains of an
enormous causeway. Might not this causeway or ‘road’ be one of the
‘ways’ to the heartland of Rostau described in the ancient texts.? Such
causeways — though now in all cases fallen into ruin — were originally
rectangular tunnels roofed over with limestone slabs and decorated with
star-spangled ceilings.'^’ It is easy to see how symbohsm ofthis kind would
have been be appropriate in the context ofthe Horus-King’s cosmic quest
to find the astral form of Osiris.
The causeway of the Sphinx runs to the immediate south of the
monument at about the level of its shoulder and thence slopes gently
upwards in a westerly direction towards the great ‘Mortuary Temple’ that
stands outside the east face of the central Pyramid of Giza. Being in every
sense ‘dry’, it makes sense to consider this causeway as being the ‘road by
land’ to Rostau.
But where might the other ‘road’ be located - the ‘way through water’.?
There may be an an important clue in the Book of What is in the Duat. In
this eerie text there is a depiction ofthe hermetically sealed chamber ofthe
‘Kingdom of Sokar’ - Sokar-Osiris - which is also the Fifth Division of
the Duat. The depiction shows a tunnel filled with water passing under the
pam of a large Sphinx (see page 148). The tunnel slopes gently upwards
leading, finally, to the Sixth Division.
Interestingly enough, as we saw in Part I, geologists working around the
Great Sphinx in the early 1990s identified a large rectangular chamber and
other ‘anomahes’ in the bedrock directly beneath the monument’s paws.
Interestingly, too, it is well known that far below the Sphinx is an
underground watertable which has been constantly replenished since
times immemorial by capillary action from the Nile.'^*

Tunnel
Dr Jean Kerisel, the eminent French engineer whose work in the
Subterranean Chamber of the Great Pyramid we are already familiar
with, has recently taken the geological evidence further by suggesting
that the Sphinx may stand over the entrance to a 700—metre-long tunnel
leading to the Great Pyramid - a tunnel that was once filled or partially filled with water
Could such a tunnel be the other ‘way’ that the Horus-King had to take
to ‘see the astral form of his Father’, i.e. Orion? The fact that inside the
King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid is, indeed, a star-shaft pointed
directly at Orion s belt — the ‘Rostau’ in the sky — adds cogency to notions
of some sort of underground access route that might have been used by
initiates to journey in secret from the Sphinx to the inner passages and chambers of the Pyramid.
Furthermore, in the Pyramid Texts we often hear of a ‘Causeway of
Happiness’ which is in the ‘North of the Field of Offerings’. And in the
following passage the Horus-King seems to be standing at the entrance of
such a causeway’ at exactly the time Sirius is performing its hehacal rising,
i.e. ‘Heralding the New Year’ 70 days after the sun’s crossing ofthe Milky Way:
I am the herald of the Year, O Osiris, I have come on business of your father
Geb [the earth-god] ... I speak to you, I have made you enduring. ‘Causeway
of Happiness’ is the name of this causeway north of the Field of Offerings.
Stand Up, Osiris, and commend me to those who are in charge of the
‘Causeway of Happiness’ north of the Field of Offerings just as you
commended Horus to Isis on that day on which you made her pregnant. .
The ‘Field of Offerings’ had a celestial location in the Duat somewhere
near Orion.^^ Duahstic logic therefore suggests that its earthly counterpart
must have been a place where ‘offerings’ were made by the Horus-King
when he was about to enter the Giza necropolis. With this in mind it is
surely of relevance that many of the New Kingdom sphinx stelae found at
Giza, including the granite stela of Thutmosis IV that stands between the
paws of the Sphinx itself, do in fact show the Horus-Kings making
offerings in a temple in front of the monument.^^ Furthermore, as the text
quoted above makes clear, the ‘Causeway ofHappiness’ ran to the north of
the ‘Field of Offerings’. An underground ‘causeway’ running north-west

from the temple of the Sphinx would lead to the Great Pyramid.
So could Kerisel’s bold hypothesis be right.?’'* Could such an
underground system exist at Giza.?
Stargate
These are questions that we shall return to in Part IV. Meanwhile what are
we to make of the mention of Isis and her pregnancy that also appears in
the above text.?
In The Orion Mystery it has been shown that the Great Pyramid’s so
called Queen’s Chamber could have been used for a symbolic ‘copulation’
or ‘seeding’ ritual involving the person ofthe Horus-King on the one hand
and the goddess Isis in her astral form (i.e. the star Sirius) on the other. In
terms ofsky-ground dualism the two might have been thought ofas being
‘connected’ through the Chamber’s southern star-shaft, which was
targeted on the meridian-transit of Sirius in the Pyramid Age.” This
hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that such a copulation ritual is found
49. Artist’s impression of the ‘cosmic’ Great Pyramid superimposing the star Sirius over the
position of the ‘gate’ in the Sirius star-shaft.

clearly depicted in the Pyramid Texts and that the momejit when Osiris
supposedly made Isis ‘pregnant’ is specified as being when Sirius crossed
the meridian at dawn.^*^ The texts also state of Osiris-Orion: ‘Your sister
Isis comes to you rejoicing for love of you. You have placed her on your
phallus and your seed issues in her, she being ready as “Sothis” [Sirius]. . ”
Was the Horus-King, then, somehow meant to find his way under and
into the Great Pyramid and thence to its upper chambers with their starshafts.?
And what might really be the significance of Rudolf Gantenbrink’s
recent discovery, which we have considered at length in Part II, of a
mysterious ‘gate’ or ‘doorway’ deep inside one of those shafts — the very
shaft that targeted the meridian-transit of Sirius in the Pyramid Age.?
Last but not least, is it a coincidence that the ancient Egyptian word sba,
‘star’, also carries the meanings ‘gate’, ‘folding door’ and ‘great door of heaven’.?
Again, these are matters on which we shall have to postpone further
conjecture until Part IV. Meanwhile let us return to the quest to unite sky
and ground - thus winning the Grail of immortality - in which all the
Horus-Kings of ancient Egypt participated.
The Splendid Place of the ‘First Time’
We left the cosmic Horus-King standing in the sky with the solar disc
between the ‘paws’ of the celestial hon, the constellation of Leo - on the spot marked by the star Regulus.
In the Pyramid Age Regulus rose at approximately 28 degrees north of
due east.'’ It is from this spot therefore that the Horus-King in the sky
must somehow travel - on one of the ‘roads’ to Rostau - to reach Orion’s belt.
Now we transpose again to the Horus-King in his earthly form at Giza,
standing between the paws of the great Sphinx.
It is the moment of dawn on the summer solstice in the epoch of 2500
BC, with Leo rising at 28 degrees north of due east, and we immediately
notice that something is wrong with the sky—ground pattern.
The Sphinx gazes due east, i.e. he does not gaze at Leo, his celestial counterpart.

this epoch the gaze ofHor-em-Akhet, ‘Horus-in-the-Horizon’ - i.e. the Great Sphinx - is not

will recall that this same sense of a curious ‘dislocation’ of the sky-ground images at the
summer solstice in 2500 BC also applies to the three great Pyramids and the three stars of
Orion’s belt.

And the causeway connecting the central Pyramid to the Sphinx
complex is directed 14 degrees south of due east—i.e. far to the right ofthe
spot where the cosmic Horus-King is supposedly at his station between
the paws of Leo and ready to travel to Rostau.
So why is the sky-image in the ‘wrong place’ on the eastern horizon? Or
to express the problem the right way round, and in the correct dualistic
terminology, why is Hor-em-Akhet, Horus-in-the-Horizon - i.e. the
Great Sphinx - not in alignment with Horakhti, Horus-of-the-Horizon,
i.e. the constellation of Leo? Why, too, is the causeway of the Sphinx not
directed to the rising sun so as to ‘link-up’ the Horus-King with his cosmic
solar counterpart?
There is, it seems, a curious ‘dislocation’ between the ground and the
sky at the summer solstice in the epoch of2500 bc. Moreover, as the reader
will recall from Chapter 8, this sense ofthe entire arrangement being out of
kilter is not confined to the Sphinx and Leo in that epoch but involves the
three great Pyramids of Giza as well.
It may be the case that the solution to the riddle has all along been
staring us in the face. Inscribed on the granite stela that the Sphinx holds
between its own heavily eroded paws - a stela that was placed there in
honour of Thutmosis IV, a mighty Horus-King of Egypt - we read the
following impressive royal titulary:
The Majesty of Horus, Mighty Bull Begetting Radiance, Favourite of the
Two Goddesses, Enduring in Kingship like Atum, Golden Horus, Mighty of
Sword, Repelling the Nine Bows, King ofUpper and Lower Egypt, Son ofRe,

Sovereign . . ., beautiful of Face like His Father, who came forth equipped

. . . Heir of Horus Upon His Throne . .
Does this sound like a man who did not have a clue, as some Egyptologists
suggest,^' as to what the great Sphinx and the other monuments of Giza
really represented? Surely not. So what, then, did the majestic Horus
King declare this sacred domain to be?
In one simple, powerful phrase, as the reader will recall, he stated that it
was ‘The Splendid Place of the “First Time” ’.“
Is it not likely, when he uttered these words, that Thutmosis, ‘Heir of

Is It not likely that he called it ‘The Splendid Place ofthe “First Time” ’

been handed down from remotest, almost incomprehensible, antiquity?

Chapter ii
The Unseen Aeademy
‘The Egyptians believed that in the
beginning their land was ruled by a dynasty
of great gods, of whom Horus, the son of Isis
and Osiris, was the last. He was succeeded
by a dynasty of semi-divine beings known as
the “followers of Horus”, who, in turn, gave
place to the historical kings of Egypt.’
Selim Hassan, The Sphinx, Cairo, 1949
When was the ‘genesis’ ofcivilization in Egypt? When did ‘history’ begin?
According to T. G. H. James, formerly Keeper ofEgyptian Antiquities
at the British Museum, and a representative voice of orthodox opinion on
these matters: ‘The first truly historical period is that which begins with
the invention of writing and it is generally known as the Dynastic Period.
It is a period extending from about 3100 bc to 332 bc and it derives its
name from the thirty-one dynasties into which the successive kings of
Egypt were divided in a scheme preserved in the work of Manetho, a
priestly historian who lived during the [third century bc]. The unlettered
cultures which flourished in Egypt before the beginning of the Dynastic
Period, and which exhibit some of the characteristics which mark the
earliest phases of Egyptian culture in the Dynastic Period, are known as
Predynastic . . . Such traces of human life as are found in the Nile Valley
dating from before the Predynastic Period are usually described in the
terms used for European Prehistory - Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and
Neolithic.’ *
So there we have it. Egyptian history - and civilization with it - began at
around 3100 bc. Before that there were merely ‘unlettered cultures’
(admittedly with some ‘civilized’ characteristics), which were in turn
preceded by ‘Stone Age’ savages (‘Palaeolithic’ means literally ‘Old Stone
Age’).
The way James puts it, the whole picture seems very clear-cut, orderly



iQo Map
and precise. He really makes it sound as though all the facts are now in
hand concerning the Predynastic Egyptians and their forebears, and that
nothing more remains to be discovered about any of them.
Such anodyne notions of the past are widespread amongst Egyptolo¬
gists who again and again in their textbooks, and also in mass-market
publications like National Geographic and Time-Life’s misleadingly
named Lost Civilizations series, convey the comforting impression that the
prehistory of Egypt is well understood, organized, categorized and safely
put in its place (James even refers us to one specific place in the British
Museum where particular enhghtenment apparently awaits us: the ‘Sixth
Egyptian Room’ with its definitive display of‘primitive tools made by the
Palaeohthic inhabitants of Egypt’).^ Likewise, on the other side of the
Atlantic as we saw in Part I, Dr Peter Lecovara, Curator ofthe Museum of
Fine Arts in Boston, assures us that ‘thousands of Egyptologists working
for hundreds of years have studied this problem [the prehistory ofEgypt]
and the chronology is pretty much worked out. There is no big surprise in store for us.’ ^
But is everything really as orderly and as well worked out as the
‘experts’ say.? And can we really be so sure that there is ‘no big surprise in store for us’.?
In our view Lecovara, James, and the many other scholars who share
their opinions, would do well to remember the advice of the late Labib
Habachi, formerly the Egyptian government’s ChiefInspector ofAntiqui¬
ties, who warned in 1984 that ‘Egyptology is a field in which chance
discovery may disprove an established theory’.** In the fight of this
possibility, Habachi’s suggestion was that Egyptologists should avoid
making unqualified statements’ and be honest enough to ‘salt their
comments with “probably” and “perhaps”.’ ^
Certainly a little more ‘probably’ and ‘perhaps’ would be in order where
the Predynastic and earlier periods ofEgyptian history are concerned. Far
from the impression conveyed to the public, the truth, as some scholars are
prepared to admit, is that ‘The state of knowledge of Egyptian prehistory
in the late twentieth century is still fragmentary’.**
These are the words ofNicholas Grimal, Professor ofEgyptology at the
Sorbonne University in Paris, who also concedes:
It has been clear since the Second World War not only that ‘prehistory’ before
the Pharaohs was expanding on a hitherto unsuspected scale, but also that it



The Unseen Academy 191
appeared to be so diverse and self-contained that it was difficult to regard it simply as a ‘preparatory’ stage for the Dynastic Period . .
The prevailing Egyptological consensus (to which Grimal in this respect
at least is an exception) is unable to offer any coherent theory which
explains these ‘diverse’ and ‘self-contained’ characteristics of Egyptian
prehistory, or that account for the very serious problems of apparent non¬
continuity between the Predynastic and the Dynastic Periods. The ancient
Egyptians themselves, however, passed down records to us which may
contain the answer to the whole mystery. These records provide detailed
information concerning a period that extends back many thousands of
years before the sudden emergence of the Pharaonic state in the epoch of
3000 BC.
The only problem is that no one is prepared to take these records
seriously. Could this be because they conflict with the modem scholarly
consensus on Egyptian chronology.? Readers must make up their own
minds but, as we shall see below, elements of the same records which do
conform to the current theory are accepted and taken seriously by
Egyptologists.
Three eras
As T. G. H. James tells us in his remarks quoted earlier, modem study of
ancient Egyptian chronology is. largely based on Manetho’s History of
Egypt. The respected Professor Walter Emery puts things much the same
way when he reports that the writings of Manetho are of ‘immense
importance and form the framework on which Egyptian history has been
built’.*
One of the reasons that Manetho’s system is so durable and remains in
use by Egyptologists today is that it has again and again proved itselfto be
accurate. He is known to have based it on ‘much older documents, or king
lists, to which, as a learned priest he had access’.’ Furthermore a number of
documents in this category - notably the Palermo Stone, the Turin
Papyrus and the Abydos King-List - have been found and translated. In
the words of the late Professor Michael Hoffman, a leading expert on
Egypt before the Pharaohs: ‘Archaeologists and Egyptologists have
discovered five such lists which, despite some discrepancies, support
Manetho in general.””



192 Map
Looking at all the surviving sources, it is clear that threeJistinct eras of
kingship were remembered:
• The first era was when the Neteru, {^"Meters' or ‘Gods’) ruled the land
of Egypt - an epoch that culminated with the kingship of Homs, the
son of Osiris and Isis.
• Then came the era of the ‘Followers of Horns’, the Shemsu Hor, (also
known by numerous other titles and epithets) which took the divine
Horian lineage across the ages and up to a human Pharaoh named
Menes (also known as Narmer or ‘King Scorpion’), the legendary
‘Unifier of the Two Lands of Upper and Lower Egypt’.
• After Menes came the so-called ‘Dynastic’ Kings, whose names are
individually catalogued in the king-fists.
Egyptologists place the reign ofMenes in circa 3000 bc and regard him
as the first ‘historical’ king of‘Dynastic’ Egypt.’* They concede that a few
Predynastic ‘chieftains’ must have preceded him in both the north and
south of the country but they emphatically reject any suggestion that the
^Meters' and the ‘Followers of Horns’ catalogued in the king-fists (and
referred to with some prominence by Manetho) could have been historical
individuals. On the contrary, the consensus view is that the Neters, being
Gods , are obvious religious fictions and that the Shemsu Hor are to be
regarded as nothing more than ‘mythical kings’ who ruled in an equally ‘mythical kingdom’.
So, scholars accept as history only the bits ofManetho and the surviving
king-lists that fit their theory - i.e. the records ofthe Dynastic Period from
Menes on - and devalue all references in those same records to earlier and more mysterious times.
Writing in the Cambridge Ancient History, for example. Professor T. E.
Peet groups together all the ancient Egyptian sources concerning the
chronology of the ‘Gods’ and the ‘Followers ofHoms’ and then dismisses
the entire corpus ofmaterial with the following throwaway remark: ‘From
the historical point of view there is little to be made of this.’
Likewise, in Kingship and the Gods, his detailed study of the Pharaonic
state, the eminent Henri Frankfort, Professor of Preclassical Antiquity at
the University ofLondon, had this to say about the ‘Followers of Horus’:
... it appears that ‘Followers of Horus’ is a vague designation for the kings of
a distant past... but it would seem unwise to treat the term as primarily of a
historical nature. For each king became at death one of the corporation of



The Unseen Academy 193
‘transfigured spirits’ . . . [and] merged with that nebulous spiritual force
which had supported the living rulers and descendents ofthe Throne ofHorus since time immemorial.'^
High initiates
We feel obliged to point out that this was not at all how the ancient
Egyptians viewed their own history. For them there was never any
question of mythical epochs or ‘nebulous spiritual forces’ lurking in the
distant past. For them, to state matters plainly, the ‘Followers of Horus’,
and the geographical landscape in which they had ‘ruled’, were unques¬
tionable realities to which they were directly and inseverably connected.
Indeed, if one takes the Egyptian accounts and traditions seriously what
the ‘Followers of Horus’ begin to sound like is a lineage of real, although
‘unnamed’ individuals whose function and duty, as Henri Frankfort
himself suggested, was to provide the ‘spiritual force’ behind the
monarchy (though by no means in a ‘vague’ or ‘nebulous’ manner). The
Egyptians’ own accounts also invite the conclusion that the role of these
‘Followers’ may have been to carry down the ages a body ofextraordinary
knowledge harking back to the even more mysterious ‘time of the Neteru'
— i.e. the ‘Gods’.
From available primary sources, in other words, the overall picture that
emerges is that the ‘Followers of Horus’ may not have been ‘kings’ in the
usual sense of the word but rather immensely powerful and enlightened
individuals - high initiates who were carefully selected by an elite academy
that established itself at the sacred site of Heliopolis-Giza thousands of
years before history began. There is much to suggest, too, that the ancient
Egyptian texts are right and that Pharaonic civilization may indeed have
owed its unique spark of genius to just such a ‘brotherhood’ linked to just
such an archaic and elite academy.
So who might the Shemsu Hor really have been.? And what were they
‘following’.?
Following the Way of Horus
Heliopolis - ancient On or Innu - was the oldest organized religious centre
in Egypt and most probably in the world. Situated some 12 miles north¬
east of the Giza plateau, and already hoary with age at the dawn of the



194 Map
53- Osiris-Orion showing the way to his ‘Followers’, the Horus-Kings, who are the custodians of his dual kingdom in the Duat.
Pharaonic epoch, it is identified by tradition as the source of the secrets of
astral immortality which the Pyramid builders claimed to have inherited.
Indeed the title of the High Priest of Heliopolis, as Professor 1. E. S.
Edwards has recently demonstrated, was ‘Chief of the Astronomers’, and
the regalia of this notable was a ceremonial robe spangled with fivepointed stars.
As we have already hinted in Part III, the dominant concerns of the
elitist, ‘scientific’ priests of Heliopolis were with recording the motions of
the stars, measuring and commemorating the passage oftime, and peering
into the mysteries of the epochs. It has long been known, too, that they
carefully studied the cycle of the sun in its perceived yearly circuit along
the zodiacal path. And more recently, compelling evidence has emerged
that they also followed the far longer cosmic cycle of the ‘Great Year’
namely the precessional ‘drift’ of the stars caused by the earth’s axial
‘wobble’. The reader will recall that this vast cycle of 25,920 years was
measured by the slow rotation of the twelve zodiacal constellations in
relation to the point of sunrise on the vernal equinox - in short, the
precession of the equinoxes’ in which a succession of astrological ‘Ages’,
each 2160 years in duration, was believed to have begun to unfold after a
kind of spiritual and cultural ‘Big Bang’ known as Zep Tepi - the ‘First Time’ of the Gods.



The Unseen Academy 195
To observe and accurately measure the rate of the precession of the
equinoxes is a feat that could only have been achieved by scientifically
minded, intellectually advanced and highly organized people with a long
tradition ofprecise observational astronomy. Similarly, the building ofthe
three great Pyramids of Giza was not the work of technological primitives
only recently emerged from the Stone Age. On the contrary, as historians
of science Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend have pointed
out, such accomplishments ‘should be a cogent reason for concluding that
serious and intelligent men were at work behind the stage, men who were
bound to have used a technical terminology’.*’
We shall argue that ‘serious and intelligent men’ - and apparently
women too — were indeed at work behind the stage of prehistory in Egypt
and propose that one of the many names by which they were known was
the ‘Followers of Homs’. We propose, too, that their purpose, to which
their generations adhered for thousands of years with the rigour of a
messianic cult, may have been to bring to fruition a great cosmic blueprint.
And we have evidence that the slow unfolding and implementation of this
plan somehow entailed tracking two observable ‘ways’ taken by the
celestial bodies across the ages - ‘ways’ which are both consequences ofthe
earth’s axial precession:
• First the ‘way’ of the stars: these appear to ‘drift’ in the sense that
their place and day of rising at the horizon changes, accompanied by
corresponding changes in their altitude at the meridian.
• Secondly the ‘way’ of the sun, which also appears to ‘drift’ - in this
case ‘westwards’ along the ecliptic path so that the ‘pointer’ of the
vernal equinox appears to ‘sweep’ slowly through each one of the
twelve zodiacal signs every 2160 years.
In the coded astronomical language of the ancients of Heliopolis, we
will argue that the notion offollowing the sun’s westward drift through the
zodiac translates as ‘Following the Way of Homs (the sun) across the
ages’. And we will show that the ‘Followers of Homs’ are most likely to
have acquired their enigmatic title because it described precisely what they
did and stood for. They were, we suspect, astrologers and astronomerspar
excellence who had been following and recording the position ofthe vernal
point across the ages from the epoch ofthe ‘First Time’ to the epoch of the
historical kings of Egypt.
Last but not least, we also propose as a hypothesis for further testing



196 Map
that at a well-defined and predetermined historical moment.‘written in the
stars’ the ‘Followers ofHorns’ may have taken steps to mobilize the native
inhabitants of Egypt, unite them into a theocratic state and harness their
energies to the further fulfilment of a cosmic blueprint in which the great
Pyramids on the west bank of the Nile were to play a pivotal role . . .



Chapter 12
Sages and ‘Followers’
‘The introduction to the first Edfu
cosmological record discloses the tradition
that the contents of these records were the
“words of the Sages”. We are told that this
sacred book was believed to be a “Copy of
the writings which Thoth made according to
the words of the Sages” . .
E. A. E. Reymond, The Mythical Origin of
the Egyptian Temple, 1969
It is a convention amongst modem scholars that myths do not count as
historical evidence - and, as we saw in the last chapter, this convention is
particularly strongly adhered to by Egyptologists.
Yet there are several well-known cases in archaeology where myths that
have been dismissed as ‘unhistorical’ were later proved to have been
entirely accurate. One example concerns the world-famous Troy of
Homer’s Iliad (a great prose-poem compiled from earlier oral sources circa
800 Bc). Until not long ago most scholars were convinced that Troy was a
‘mythical city’ - i.e. entirely a figment of Homer’s fertile imagination. In
1871, however, the ‘buccaneer’ German explorer Heinrich Schliemann
proved orthodox opinion wrong when he followed geographical clues
contained in the Iliad and discovered Troy in western Turkey near the
Dardanelles (the ancient Hellespont) - exactly where Homer had said it
was located. Schliemann and two other intrepid researchers, the Greek
scholar Kalokairinos and the British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans, then
went on to cap this achievement by following up myths concerning the
great ‘Minoan’ civilization that was said to have existed on the island of
Crete. These myths, too, were dismissed as unhistorical by orthodox
opinion but were vindicated when Schliemann and his team excavated the
remains of a highly advanced culture now firmly identified as that of the
‘Minoans’.'



198 Map
Similarly, in the Indian subcontinent, the great body ofancient Sanscrit
scriptures known as the Rig-Veda contains repeated references to a high
civilization, living in fortified cities, that had preceded the Aryan invasions
more than 4000 years ago. Again these references were universally
dismissed as ‘mythical’ - until, that is, the ruins ofthe great ‘Indus Valley’
cities such as Harappa and Moenjodaro began to be unearthed in the
twentieth century and proved to date back as far as 2500 BC.^
In short, the record shows that whole cities and civilizations which were
once classified as mythical (and therefore of no historical interest) have a
habit again and again ofsuddenly materiahzing from the mists ofobscurity
and becoming historical realities.
Could the same thing be about to happen in Egypt.?
Guardians of records
Amongst other peoples such as the Romans and the Greeks, who were
considerably closer to ancient Egypt than we are, it was held to be
axiomatic that the Pharaohs and their priests were the guardians of
accurate records concerning certain highly significant events that had
taken place long, long ago. Indeed these records were actually seen and
studied, at the sacred city of Heliopohs, by such distinguished visitors as
Herodotus (fifth century bc), the Greek lawmaker Solon (640-560 Bc) and
his fellow countryman the scientist Pythagoras (sixth century bc).^ From
their reports derived the Greek impression of Egypt reported by Plato:^
We Greeks are in reality children compared with this people with traditions
ten times older. And as nothing of precious remembrance of the past would
long survive in our country, Egypt has recorded and kept eternally the wisdom
of the old times. The walls of its temples are covered with inscriptions and the
priests have always under their own eyes that divine heritage. . . The
generations continue to transmit to successive generations these sacred things
unchanged: songs, dances, rhythms, rituals, music, paintings, all coming from
time immemorial when gods governed the earth in the dawn of civilization.^
We have already made frequent mention of Zep Tepi, the supposedly
mythical ‘First Time’ ofthe Gods - a remote epoch with which the ancient
Egyptians associated the origins of their civilization. And in the last
chapter we noted that Manetho’s fabled History, and a number of
inscriptions known as king-lists, also refer back to distant golden ages



Sages and ‘Followers’ 199
when the gods, and then subsequently the mysterious ‘Followers of
Homs’, ruled in the Nile Valley. Before immersing ourselves in the next
chapter in the truly immense chronology of which all the hsts speak, our
objective here, as Plato prompts, is to take a look at the ‘walls of temples’
specifically at the so-called ‘Building Texts’ {circa 200 bc) inscribed on the
walls of the Temple of Edfu that stands in Upper Egypt midway between
Luxor and Aswan. These texts, which contain a series of extraordinary
references to the ‘First Time’, are accepted by scholars as the only
surviving fragments ofa much more ancient, much larger, and much more
coherent body of cosmogonical hterature — now long lost — that once
incorporated a complete ‘mythical history’ of Egypt, of its gods and of the
temples built to honour them.^ In the texts, the ‘Followers of Horns’ are
equated and merged with other ‘mythical’ beings, sometimes seemingly
divine, sometimes human, who are always portrayed as the bringers and
preservers ofknowledge down the ages - as an elite brotherhood dedicated
to the transmission of wisdom and to the quest for resurrection and
rebirth . . .
Memories of the dawn
The Temple of Edfu in its present form was erected over a two hundred
year period between 237 bc and 57 BC but incorporates parts of much
earlier structures dating back to the Pyramid Age (for example portions of
the inner and outer western enclosure wall). Moreover, like all major
temples, it was built ‘on hallowed ground’ and there attaches to it a
recollection of vast antiquity and of momentous antecedents.’
Thus, on the face of things, the Building Texts appear to be nothing
more than a history of the Edfu Temple itself, together with descriptions
ofits rooms and halls and oftheir ritual purpose and significance.* A closer
look, however, as E. A. E. Reymond of Manchester University has
demonstrated, reveals a subtext which hints:
at the existence of certain mythological events . . . where the foundation,
building and bringing to life of the historical temple [ofEdfu] is interpreted as
happening in a mythical age. The historical temple is interpreted as the work
of the gods themselves, and as an entity ofa mythical nature. This... seems to
indicate a belief in a historical temple that was a direct continuation,
projection, and reflexion of a mythical temple that came into existence at the
beginning of the world . .



200 Map
Needless to say the ‘beginning of the world’ is a synonym in the Edfu
Texts for the ‘First Time’, also known as the ‘Early Primeval Age’. In this
epoch, we learn, the ‘words of the Sages’ were copied down by the
wisdom-god Thoth into a book that codified the locations of certain
sacred mounds’ along the Nile. The title ofthis lost book, according to the
texts, was Specifications ofthe Abounds ofthe Early Primaeval Age, and it
was believed to have contained records not only ofall the lesser ‘Mounds’,
or temples, but also of the Great Primeval Mound itself, the place where
time had supposedly begun.'®
Several points of interest arise:
1 The ‘Great Primeval Mound’ has recently been associated by
Professor I. E. S. Edwards with the natural outcropping of rock that
is known to lie under the Great Pyramid of Egypt and to have been
incorporated into its lower courses of masonry." This analysis
appears to reinforce the connections that we have already established
in Part I between the Giza necropolis and the ‘First Time’.
2 The ‘Sages’ referred to in the Edfu Building Texts were seven in
number. Their special role was as ‘the only divine beings who knew
how the temples and sacred places were to be created’. And it was
they who initiated construction work at the Great Primeval Mound.
This work, in which Thoth also participated, involved the setting out
and erection of the original ‘mythical’ temple of the ‘First Time’.'^
3 Also constructed under the direction of the ‘Seven Sages’ was an
edifice specified as hm-ntr, ‘the mansion of the god’: ‘ “Speedy of
construction , men called it by name. The sanctuary is within it.
Great Seat” by name, and all its chapels are according to the norm.’
4 When all these works were complete ‘the magical protection (smr
mdw) of that site was made by the Sages’.'''
5 In the whole corpus of ancient Egyptian writings, the Edfu Building
Texts preserve the only references to the ‘Seven Sages’ that have
survived to the present day. Egyptologists have therefore paid little
attention to the identity of these beings beyond conceding that that
they appear to have played a part in ‘a much wider and more general
theory concerning the origin of sacred domains and their temples’.'^
In our opinion, however, there is something notable about the context
in which the Texts describe the Sages. This context is marked by a



Sages and ‘Followers’ 201
preponderance of ‘Flood’ imagery in which the ‘primeval waters’ (out
of which the Great Primeval Mound emerged) are depicted as
gradually receding.*^ We are reminded of Noah’s mountain-top on
which the Ark settled after the Biblical Deluge, and of the ‘Seven
Sages’ {Apkallu) of ancient Babylonian tradition who were said to
have ‘lived before the Flood’ and to have built the walls of the sacred
city of Uruk.*’ Likewise is it an accident that in Indian tradition
‘Seven Sages’ (Rishis) are remembered to have survived the Flood,
their purpose being to preserve and pass down to future generations
the wisdom of the antedeluvian world?'*
In all cases the Sages appear as the enlightened survivors of a cataclysm
that wiped the earth clean, who then set about making a fresh start at the
dawn of a new age - which, in ancient Egypt, was referred to as the ‘First
Time’. As Reymond confirms in her masterly study of the Edfu Texts:
the first era known by our principal sources was a period which startedfrom what
existed in the past. The general tone of the record seems to convey the view that
an ancient world, after having been constituted, was destroyed, and as a dead
world it came to be the basis of a new period of creation which at first was the
re-creation and resurrection of what once had existed in the past.’’
Wisdom and knowledge
According to the Edfu Texts the Seven Sages and the other gods came
originally from an island,^" the ‘Homeland of the Primeval Ones’.^' As
noted above, the texts are adamant that the agency that destroyed this
island was a flood. They also tell us that it came to its end suddenly^^ and
that the majority of its ‘divine inhabitants’ were drowned.^^ Arriving in
Egypt, those few who survived then became ‘the Builder Gods, who
fashioned in the primeval time, the Lords of Light . . . the Ghosts, the
Ancestors . . . who raised the seed for gods and men. . . , the Senior Ones
who came into being at the beginning, who illumined this land when they
came forth unitedly . .
It was not believed that these remarkable beings were immortal. On the
contrary, after they had completed their tasks they died and their children
took their places and performed funerary rites on their behalf.^’ In this
way, just like the ‘Followers of Horus’, the generations of the ‘Builder
Gods’, or ‘Sages’, or ‘Ghosts’ or ‘Lords of Light’ described in the Edfu



202 Map
Texts could constantly renew themselves - thus passing down to the
future traditions and wisdoms stemming from a previous epoch of the
earth. Indeed, the similarities between the ‘Senior Ones’ of Edfu and the
Shemsu Hor ofHeliopolitan tradition are so marked it is hard to escape the
conclusion that both epithets, and the numerous others that exist, are all
descriptions of the same shadowy brotherhood.
This impression is strengthened by the constant references in the Edfu
Texts to the wisdom of the Sages’ (wisdom being one of the defining
characteristics ofthe ‘Followers ofHoms’) and the repeated emphasis that
their special gift was knowledge - including, but not limited to, the
knowledge of architecture.^ Likewise it is noteworthy that the Sages are
said to have specified the plans and designs that were to be used for all
future temples - a role frequently accorded in other contexts to the
‘Followers of Horns’. For example, the temple of Dendera (a little to the
north ofEdfu) is inscribed with Building Texts ofits own which state that
the great plan followed by its architects was ‘recorded in ancient writings
handed down from the “Followers of Horus”
Heliopolitan origins
The earliest-surviving references to the ‘Followers of Horus’ occur in the
Pyramid Texts. It is therefore unlikely to be an accident that the notion in
the Edfu Texts ofthe Great Primeval Mound emerging from the waters of
a universal deluge coincides exactly with imagery that has also been
preserved in the Pyramid Texts in which, as E. A. E. Reymond
summarizes: ‘The Earth in its earliest shape was pictured as a mound
which emerged from the primeval water. This mound itself was then
considered as a divine being, and as the original terrestrial configuration on
which the creator, Atum, dwelt.’
As is well known, the compilation ofthe Pyramid Texts was undertaken
by the priests of Heliopolis.^’ It may therefore be of relevance that ancient
Egyptian traditions attribute the founding of Heliopolis to the ‘Followers
of Horus’ - in a period long before the beginning of Dynastic times - and
that there is an Egyptian papyrus, now in the Berlin Museum, which
clearly suggests that Heliopolis in some way ‘existed before the earth was



Sages and ‘Followers’ 203
created’.^® Once again, this interlinks closely with a central proposition of
the Edfu Texts, namely that the ‘new world’ created by the Sages after the
Flood was conceived of and designed by its makers as ‘the resurrection of
the former world of the gods.’
There are other links too. For example what Reymond calls ‘the
manifestation of the resurrection of the first holy world’ took the form in
the Edfu Texts of an upright column or rod, ‘the Perch’ on which a great
bird, the Divine Falcon, rested.In Heliopolis there stood a pillar (indeed
/«««, the Egyptian name for Heliopolis, actually means ‘pillar’^^) on which
it was believed that another ‘Divine’ bird — the Bennu^ or phoenix
periodically rested.^'^ And interestingly the hieroglyph for Heliopolis - a
column surmounted by a cross above (or beside) a circle divided into eight
parts^^ - is virtually identical to a hieroglyph depicting the Edfu ‘Perch’
that is reproduced by Flinders Petrie in his Royal Tombs of the Earliest
Dynasties?^
For all these reasons, and many others, Reymond concludes that ‘the
Edfu documentary sources offer . . . one argument more in favour of the
theory that the ritual ofthe Egyptian temple was Heliopolitan in origin . . .
We are of the opinion that the Edfu records preserve the memory of a
Predynastic religious centre which once existed near to Memphis, which
the Egyptians looked on as the homeland of the Egyptian temple.’
What better candidate is there for that ‘Predynastic religious centre
near to Memphis’ - that ‘homeland’ of the Egyptian temple - than the
sacred city of Heliopolis and its associated Pyramids and other structures
on the Giza plateau.? Moreover, as the reader will recall, the Giza/
Heliopolis complex lies to the north of ancient Memphis. In this light a
well-known text on the inner face of the enclosure wall of the temple at
Edfu takes on a special meaning, for it tells us that the temple was built ‘at
the dictates of the Ancestors’ according to what was written in a certain
‘book’ which had ‘descended from the sky to the north of Memphis’.^*
There is of course a sense in which the cosmic monuments of Giza
could themselves be said to be a kind of ‘book’ written in stone and
‘descended from the sky’ - for, as we now know, the three great Pyramids
are the terrestrial counterparts of the three stars of Orion’s belt and the
Sphinx draws down to earth the regal image of Leo, the celestial lion.



204 Map
Cycle of the phoenix
The Primeval Mound, identified with the Great Pyramid and with the
natural mound of rock that is incorporated into the foundations of that
monument, is envisaged in the Pyramid Texts as a place at once of birth
and death, and also as a place of rebirth.^’ These ideas fit well with the
ancient Egyptian rituals for ‘awakening Osiris’ and attaining astral
immortality — and with the quest of the Horus-King — that we have
described in earlier chapters. They also accord with the sense that the texts
convey ofa cyclical rhythm at work in the universe as the vast ‘Mill’ ofthe
zodiac grinds out the destiny of world ages.
In Heliopolitan theology, all these processes were grouped together,
summarized and expressed in a single image - the Bennu bird, the
legendary Phoenix which at certain widely separated intervals ‘fashioned a
nest of aromatic boughs and spices, set it on fire and was consumed in the
flames. From the pyre miraculously sprang a new phoenix, which, after
embalming its father’s ashes in an egg of myrrh, flew with the ashes to
Heliopolis where it deposited them in the altar of the Egyptian sun-god.
Re. A variant of the story made the dying phoenix fly to Heliopolis and
immolate itself in the altar fire, from which the young phoenix then
rose . . . The Egyptians associated the phoenix with immortality.’
Sources vary as to the period of the Bennu's return, but in his
authoritative study on the subject R. T. Rundle Clark mentions the figure
of 12,954 years. Let us note that this figure accords very closely with a
half-cycle of precession (where the full cycle, as we have seen, is 25,920
years). As such, the return of the phoenix’ could be expressed in
astronomical terms either as a slow ‘sweep’ of the vernal point through six
houses of the zodiac - for example from the beginning of Leo to the
beginning of Aquarius - or, at the meridian, as the number of years
required for a star to move between its minimum and maximum altitudes above the horizon.
When considering such co-ordinates in the sky, we are immediately
reminded of the Giza necropolis - of how the gaze of the Great Sphinx
targets the vernal point on the eastern horizon, and of how the star-shafts
of the Great Pyramid lock in to the meridian with machine-age accuracy.
Moreover it can hardly be an accident that the capstone or pyramidion
placed on top of all pyramids was known in the ancient Egyptian language
as the Benben and was considered to be a symbol of the Bennu bird (and



Sages and ‘Followers’ 205
thus also of rebirth and immortality)/^ These capstones were replicas of
the original Benben stone - perhaps a conical, ‘orientated’ meteorite‘s^
which was said to have ‘fallen from heaven’ and which was kept in
Heliopolis, perched atop a pillar in a Temple called the ‘Mansion of the
Phoenix’.'S'
Is it not apparent, therefore, that we are confronted here by a tightly
knit complex of interwoven ideas, all additionally complicated by masses
of Egyptian dualism, in which stone stands for bird, and bird for stone,"*^
and both together speak of rebirth and of the ‘eternal return’?
The capstone is of course missing from the summit of the Great
Pyramid at Giza. And the Benben of Heliopolis was already long lost to
history by the time of the Greeks . .
Will these treasures, too, sooner or later ‘return’?

Ancestor gods
‘Underlying all Egyptian speculation’, as R. T. Rundle Clark has
observed, ‘is the beliefthat time is composed ofrecurrent cycles which are
divinely appointed . . There is furthermore a governing moment
amongst all these cycles and epochs — the ‘genesis event’ that the
Egyptians called Zep Tepi, the ‘First Time’.
Zep means ‘Time’, Tepi means ‘First’.
But Tepi also has other connotations. For example, it is the word for ‘the
foremost point of a ship’ and it can likewise be interpreted as ‘the first day
of a period of time’. Moreover, according to the astute analysis of Robert
K. G. Temple: ‘The basic meaning of the word Tep is “mouth” . . . and
even more fundamentally the “beginning or commencement of any¬ thing”.’
Perhaps because of this persistent connection with the beginning of
things, Tepi can also mean ancestors’. And the Tepi-aui-qeTr-en-pet were
‘the ancestor-gods of the circle of the sky’.'*’ Also in the Pyramid Texts
Tepi-aui is one ofthe many titles by which the ancestral deities ofthe ‘early
primeval age’ were known - the gods and Sages, or ‘Followers of Homs’,
who were supposedly there, at the dawn of civilization, when the phoenix
alighted atop the pillar at Heliopolis, uttering a great cry and setting in
motion the ‘time’ of our present epoch of the world . . .
Curiously, the hieroglyphic sign used to determine the Tepi-aui is the
body ofa large, slouching lion, with only the paws, breast and head shown.
And we find a similar device being used as the determinative for a very
similar class of beings called the Akeru, described in Wallis Budge’s
Hieroglyphic Dictionary as a group of gods said to be the ancestors of Re.^®
The reader will recall from earlier chapters that one of the distinguish¬
ing features of the Fifth Division of the Duat is the presence there of a
giant double-lion Sphinx-god named Aker whom Egyptologist Mark
Lehner suggests may be ‘a representation ofthe Sphinx at Giza’.^‘ Since it
is from Aker that the Akeru derive their name, it is natural that the
hieroglyphs should depict them either in the form ofslouching lions, or of
two lions back to back, or of a double-headed lion.^^
So the texts seem to invite us to attach leonine characteristics to the
‘men or gods ofolden times’, to the ‘Ancestors’, and to the Sages. But they
also invite something else when, as we shall see in the next chapter, they
link the whole concept of ancestral dynasties of gods and spirits with



Sages and ‘Followers’ 207
another closely related word, Akhu, meaning, variously, the ‘Shining
Ones’, the ‘Star People’ or the ‘Venerables’. In this way they will lead us
back to the trail of the ‘Followers of Horus’ and to the notion that for
thousands ofyears - spanning both the prehistoric and the historic periods
— the members of a hidden academy may have been at work behind the
scenes in Egypt, observing the stars with scientific rigour and manipulat¬
ing men and events according to a celestial timetable . . .



Chapter 13
Following the Stars
‘The disposition of the stars as well as their
movements have always been the subject of
careful observation among the Egyptians ...
they have preserved to this day records
concermng each of these stars over an
incredible number of years, this study having
been zealously preserved among them from
ancient times.’
Diodorus Siculus, Book V, first century bc
It should be clear by now that the ancient Egyptians had very distinct ideas
about the length and scope of their history, and that they set the ‘First
Time’, the ‘genesis event’ for their civilization, far back in what the Edfu
Building Texts call the Early Primeval Age’. Just how long ago that event
actually took place is not an issue that will be easily resolved because the
surviving texts - the king-lists, the very few fragments of Manetho’s
History that have been preserved, and certain travellers’ tales - are mostly
incomplete and at times mutually contradictory. Moreover we are obliged
to cut our way through a luxuriant jungle ofdiverse terminologies - Sages,
Ancestors, Spirits of the Dead, the ‘FoUowers ofHorns’, etc., etc. - which
further complicates the problem of trying to arrive at a coherent picture.
Nevertheless, let us see what we can glean from these ancient sources. Let
us try to put the jigsaw puzzle together . . .
Shining ones
Amongst the very few king-lists that have survived to the present day, the
so-called ‘Turin Papyrus’ reaches particularly deeply into the dark abyss
of the past. Regrettably, more than half of the contents of this fragile
document from the second millennium bc have been lost because of the
gross incompetence with which it was handled by scholars when it was



Following the Stars 209
transferred (in a biscuit tin) from the collection of the King of Sardinia to
its present home in the Museum of Turin.' The remaining fragments,
however, offer occasional tantalising glimpses of an astonishing chronol¬
ogy.
Of the greatest importance amongst these fragments is a badly damaged
vertical register in which the names and reigns of ten Neteru or ‘Gods’
were originally given. Although in most cases the durations ofthese reigns
are now illegible or completely broken away, it is possible to read the figure
of 3126 years ascribed to the rule of the wisdom-god Thoth and the figure
of 300 years ascribed to Horus, the last fully ‘divine’ king of Egypt.^
Immediately afterwards comes a second vertical register devoted to the
‘Followers of Horus’ — the Shemsu Hor — the most prominent of that
general class of beings variously called ‘Ancestors’, or ‘Sages’ or ‘Ghosts’
or ‘Spirits’ whom the Egyptians remembered as having bridged the gap
between the time of the gods and the time of Menes (the supposed first
king of the first historical Dynasty circa 3000 bc).^ Again much of the
register is missing, but its last two lines, which seem to represent a
summing-up, are of particular interest: ^ThtAkhu, Shemsu Hor^ 13,420
years; Reigns before the Shemsu Hor, 23,200 years; Total 36,620 years.’''
The plural word *'Akhu\ is normally translated as ‘Venerables’.^ Yet, as
we hinted at the end of the last chapter, a close examination of the full
range of meanings that the ancient Egyptians attached to it suggests that
another and far more intriguing possibility exists - one that is concealed by
so generahzed an epithet. To be specific, the hieroglyphs for Akhu can also
mean ‘Transfigured Beings’, ‘Shining Ones’, ‘Shining Beings’ or ‘Astral
Spirits’ - understandably identified by some linguists with the stars.^ And
there are other shades of meaning, too, that cry out to be taken into
account. For example in Sir E. A. Wallis Budge’s authoritative Hiero¬
glyphic Dictionary the following additional definitions are provided for
Akhu\ ‘to be bright’, ‘to be excellent’, or ‘to be wise’ and ‘instructed’.’ And
Budge further informs us that the word was frequently associated with
‘those who recite formulae’.*
Such data, we suggest, calls for a rethink of the title ‘Venerables’ as
applied to the ‘Followers of Horus’ in the Turin Papyrus.’ Rather than
merely being ‘venerable’, is it not possible that what was meant to be
conveyed by the word Akhu in this context was a picture of vastly
enlightened and learned people, apparently with some connection to or



210 Map
interest in the stars — in short an elite of highly initiated astronomer
philosophers?
In support of this notion is the fact that the ‘Followers of Horus’ were
frequently linked in the ancient texts to another equally enlightened and
‘shining’ class of ancestral beings called the ‘Souls ofPe’ and the ‘Souls of
Nekhen’.*® Now Pe and Nekhen were actual geographical locations in
Egypt - the former in the north and the latter in the the south."
Interestingly enough, however, as Professor Henri Frankfort has con¬
firmed, the ‘Souls’ of both these places were also frequently grouped
collectively under yet another title, the ‘Souls of Heliopolis\^^ who were
said to assist the King’s ascent to heaven, a function commonly performed
by the Souls of Nekhen and Pe . . . A relief depicting this function shows
the Souls ofPe and Nekhen in the act, while the text calls them the “Souls
of Hehopolis”.’"
It is generally accepted that the term ‘Soul’ -Ba-^ used by the ancient
Egyptians had stellar attributes connected to the notion of eternal hfe in
the Dual to which all the historical Pharaohs aspired. Moreover, as
Frankfort rightly points out, the Pyramid Texts do indeed define the
dominant role of the ‘Souls’ of Pe and Nekhen - and thus the ‘Souls’ of
Heliopolis - as being to ensure that when a Pharaoh died he would be
‘equipped’ to ascend to the sky and find his way into the cosmic Kingdom
of Osiris." This in turn coincides with what we know of the Sages ofEdfu
and the Followers of Horus , both of whom, as we have seen, may be
identified with a single and originally Heliopolitan ‘brotherhood’ of
temple-makers whose function was to prepare and initiate the generations
of the Horus-Kings in order to bring about the ‘resurrection’ of what was
remembered as ‘the former world of the gods’."
Legacy
The notion that some form ofinvisible college could have established itself
at Heliopolis thousands of years before the Pharaohs, and could have been
the initiating force behind the creation and unfolding of ancient Egyptian
civilization, helps to explain one of the greatest mysteries confronted by
Egyptology — namely the extremely sudden, indeed dramatic, manner in
which Pharaonic culture ‘took off in the early third millennium bc. The
independent researcher John Anthony West, whose breakthrough work



Following the Stars 211
on the geology ofthe Sphinx we reported in Part I, formulates the problem
especially well:
Every aspect of Egyptian knowledge seems to have been complete at the very
beginning. The sciences, artistic and architectural techniques and the
hieroglyphic system show virtually no signs of a period of ‘development’;
indeed, many of the achievements of the earliest d3masties were never
surpassed or even equalled later on. This astonishing fact is readily admitted
by orthodox Egyptologists, but the magnitude of the mystery it poses is
skilfully understated, while its many implications go unmentioned.
How does a complex civilization spring full-blown into being.? Look at a
1905 automobile and compare it to a modem one. There is no mistaking the
process of ‘development’. But in Egypt there are no parallels. Everything is
right there at the start.
The answer to the mystery is ofcourse obvious, but because it is repellent to
the prevailing cast of modem thinking, if is seldom seriously considered.
Egyptian civilization was not a ‘development’, it was a legacy.'*
Might not the preservers of that legacy, who eventually bequeathed it to
the Pharaohs at the beginning of the Dynastic Period, have been those
revered and secretive individuals - the ‘Followers of Horus’, the Sages,
the Senior Ones — whose memory haunts the most archaic traditions of
Egypt like a persistent ghost.!*
Gods and heroes
In addition to the Turin Papyrus other chronological records support the
notion of an immensely ancient ‘academy’ at work behind the scenes in
Egypt. Amongst these, the most influential were compiled, as we saw
earlier, by Manetho (literally, ‘Truth of Thoth’), who lived in the third
century BC and who ‘rose to be high priest in the temple at Heliopolis’.*’
There he wrote his now lost History ofEgypt which later commentators tell
us was divided up into three volumes dealing, respectively, with ‘the
Gods, the Demigods, the Spirits of the Dead and the mortal Kings who
ruled Egypt’.**
The ‘Gods’ it seems, ruled for 13,900 years. After them ‘the Demigods
and Spirits of the Dead’ - epithets for the ‘Followers ofHorus’ - ruled for
a further 11,025 years.*’ Then began the reign of the mortal kings, which
Manetho divided into the thirty-one dynasties still used and accepted by
scholars today.



212 Map
Other fragments from Manetho’s History also suggest that important
and powerful beings were present in Egypt long before the dawn of its
historical period under the rule of Menes. For example Fragment 3,
preserved in the works of George Syncellus, speaks of‘six dynasties or six
gods who . . . reigned for 11,985 years’/® And in a number of sources
Manetho is said to have given the figure of 36,525 years for the entire
duration of the civilization of Egypt from the time ofthe gods down to the
end of the last dynasty of mortal kings/*
A rather different total ofaround 23,000 years has been handed down to
us by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus who visited Egypt in the first
century bc and spoke there with priests and chroniclers. According to the
stories he was told: ‘At first Gods and Heroes ruled Egypt for a little less
than 18,000 years . . . Mortals have been kings of their country, they say,
for a httle less than 5000 years.’
Time bridge
An overview of all the available chronologies in context of other related
documents such as the Pyramid Texts and the Edfu Building Texts leaves
two distinct impressions. Despite the conflicts and confusions over the
precise numbers ofyears involved, and despite the endless proliferation of
names and titles and honorifics and epithets:
• It is clear that the ancient Egyptians thought in terms of very long
periods of time and would never have accepted the Egyptological
view that their civilization ‘began’ with the First Dynasty of
Pharaohs.
• It is clear that they were aware of an ‘influence’ at work in their
history - a continuous, unbroken influence that had extended over
many thousands of years and that was wielded by an elite group of
divine and semi-divine beings, often associated with leonine
symbolism, who were called variously ‘Gods and Heroes’, the ‘Spirits
of the Dead’, the ‘Souls’, the ‘Sages’, the ‘Shining Ones’, the
‘Ancestors’, the ‘Ancestor-Gods of the Circle of the Sky’, the
‘Followers of Horns’, etc., etc.
It IS clear, m other words, that the ancient Egyptians envisaged a kind of
‘time bridge’, linking the world of men to the world of the gods, today to
yesterday and ‘now’ to the ‘First Time’. It is clear, too that responsibility



Following the Stars 213
55. It is clear that the ancient Egyptians were aware ofan ‘influence’ at work in their history - a
continuous, unbroken influence that extended over many thousands of years and that was
wielded by an elite group of divine and semi-divine ^ings.
for maintaining this ‘bridge’ was attributed to the ‘Followers ofHorus’ (by
this and many other names). And it is clear that the ‘Followers’ were
remembered as having carried down intact the traditions and secrets ofthe
gods — always preserving them, permitting not a single change - until
finally sharing them with the first dynasties of Egypt’s mortal kings.
Following the vernal point
The etymology of the ancient Egyptian term Shemsu Hor, ‘Followers of
Homs’, was studied by the Alsatian scholar R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz
who concluded: ‘The term Shemsu Hor. . . literally means. . . “those who
follow the path of Horus”, that is, the “Horian way”, also called the solar
way . . . These Followers ofHorus bear with them a knowledge of “divine
origin” and unify the country with it. . .’ ^^
The ‘solar way’ or ‘path of Horus’ is, of course, the ecliptic - that
imaginary way or path in the sky on which the sun appears to travel
through the twelve signs of the zodiac. As we saw in earlier chapters, the
direction of the sun’s ‘journey’ during the course of the solar year is



214 Map
Aquarius —> Pisces —> Aries Taurus Gemini —> Cancer —> Leo, etc.,
etc. The reader will recall, however, that there is also another, more
ponderous motion, the precession of the earth’s axis, which gradually
rotates the ‘ruling’ constellation against the background of which the sun
is seen to rise at dawn on the vernal equinox. This great cycle, or ‘Great
Year’, takes 25,920 solar years to complete, with the vernal point spending
2,160 years in each of the twelve zodiacal constellations. The direction of
motion is Leo —> Cancer —> Gemini —> Taurus —> Aries —^ Pisces —>
Aquarius, etc., etc., i.e. the reverse of the route pursued by the sun during
the course of the solar year.
We suggest that the ‘Followers of Horus^ followed — in a very precise,
astronomical sense — not only the annual path of the sun, eastwards
through the zodiac, but also, for thousands of years, the vernal point’s
relentless precessional drift westwards through the same twelve constella¬
tions. We also suggest that this shadowy brotherhood, whose members
were said to have carried the ‘knowledge of divine origin’ (which they
would later use to ‘unify the country’), may have interrelated on an
extremely selective basis with the more primitive inhabitants of the Nile
Valley in the prehistoric and Predynastic periods, interbreeding with
chosen women and recruiting new generations from amongst the brightest
and the best of their offspring - but leaving little or no trace of their
presence in the archaeological record. We suggest, too, that around the
beginning of the third millennium bc something happened in the cosmic
order ofthe night sky - something long preordained and expected by their
astronomers — that caused the ‘Followers’ to launch their grand attempt to
initiate and ‘unify’ the historical civilization of Egypt. Last but not least,
we suggest that whoever they really may have been, it was the ‘Followers’
— the Sages, the Builder Gods — who provided this nascent civilization
with the injection ofadvanced technical knowledge, engineering, architec¬
tural and organizing skills necessary for the completion ofthe vast celestial
temple that we know today as the Giza necropolis
In the next chapters we will test some of these hypotheses.



Chapter 14
Space—Time Co-ordinates
‘The mind has lost its cutting edge, we
hardly understand the andents.’
Gregoire de Tours, sixth century ad
In astronomical terms the ‘vernal point’ is the ‘address’ that the sun
occupies on the spring equinox — its particular position on that particular
day against the background of the zodiacal constellations that encircle the
ecliptic (i.e. the perceived ‘path’ of the sun). As a result of a cosmic
coincidence these twelve prominent constellations are distributed in the
heavens in the plane of the ecliptic (i.e. in the plane of the earth’s orbit
aroimd the sun) and, furthermore, are spaced out more or less evenly
around it. The vernal point, however, is not fixed. Because of the
phenomenon ofprecession, as we have seen in earlier chapters, it gradually
sweeps around the whole ‘dial’ of the zodiac at a precise and predictable
rate.
Between 3000 bc and 2500 bc, the epoch in which Egypt appears to
have received the sudden spark of genius that initiated the most brilliant
achievements of the Pyramid Age, the vernal point was stationed on the
immediate right (i.e. ‘west’) bank of the Milky Way, drifting almost
imperceptibly slowly past the small group of stars, known as the Hyades,
which form the head of Taurus* - the Bull of the Sky.
What this means is that the vernal point had arrived in that region ofthe
sky dominated by the adjacent constellations of Taurus and Orion, and
particularly by the three stars ofOrion’s belt. Moreover, as we have seen in
Part I, the three great Pyramids of Giza - which stand on the west bank of
the Nile — were designed to serve as terrestrial models, or ‘doubles’ of
those three stars.
Now here is the interesting thing. If we regard the Giza Pyramids (in



2i6 Map
relation to the Nile) as part of a scaled-down ‘map’ of the ri^ht bank of the
Milky Way, then we would need to extend that ‘map’ some 20 miles to the
south in order to arrive at the point on the ground where the Hyades
Taurus should be represented. How likely is it to be an accident that two
enormous Pyramids - the so-called ‘Bent’ and ‘Red’ Pyramids ofDahshur
— are found at this spot.^ And how likely is it to be an accident, as was
demonstrated in The Orion Mystery, that the site plan of these
monuments, i.e. their pattern on the ground, correlates very precisely with
the pattern in the sky of the two most prominent stars in the Hyades.? ^
We suggest none of this is accidental, that the ‘celestial signal’ which
‘sparked off the incredible Pyramid-building programme of Egypt’s
Fourth Dynasty was provided by the precessional drift of the vernal point
into the Hyades-Taurus region, and that the ‘Hyades Pyramids’ of
Dahshur were therefore naturally built first.
Such a theory provides a motive for the vast enterprise of Fourth
Dynasty Pyramid construction (involving some 25 million tons of stone
blocks - more than 75 per cent of all the stone that was quarried and
shaped into Pyramids during the Pyramid Age).^ In addition, it accords
fully with archaeological evidence which suggests that the two superb
Pyramids at Dahshur were built by Sneferu (2572-2551 bc), the founder
of the Fourth Dynasty and the father of Khufu. In other words the Bent
and the Red Pyramids were indeed built before any ofthe great Pyramids of
Giza'* - which is exactly what one would expect if the drift of the vernal
point into the Hyades-Taurus was the trigger that set the whole enterprise in motion.
And there is something else.
Journey in time
The Hyades-Taurus region, together with its terrestrial analogue, is
identified in the Pyramid Texts as the starting point for the Horus-King’s
‘quest’ - i.e. that great dualistic journey, enacted both in the sky and on the
ground, that we described in Part III. As the reader will recall, the texts
specifically and unambiguously instruct Horus in his solar form, i.e. the
sun’s disc, to position himself at this starting point and thence to ‘go to
Horakhti’, i.e. to voyage eastwards towards the constellation of Leo. And



Space—Time Co-ordinates 217
we have seen how the sun actually does this, sailing along the ecliptic path
during the solar year in the direction Taurus —> Gemini —> Cancer —> Leo.
This order of the constellations therefore appears to define ‘forward’
movement in time and, at one level, the identifiable astronomical events
described in the texts do indeed unfold in the ‘normal’ forward- direction of
the solar year (after being stationed near Taurus, and then crossing the
Milky Way, the sun reaches Leo later in the year - i.e. later in time).
Moreover this same ‘normal’ forward motion also appears to be mirrored
in the ritual performed by the Horus-King on the ground: i.e. after
crossing the river Nile it is inevitable that the initiate will arrive at the
breast of the Great Sphinx somewhat later in time.
But in the Pyramid Texts, and in the arrangement of the Giza
monuments — as in so much else that has come down to us from ancient
Egypt — everything may not be quite what it seems. An awareness of the
effects of precession on the part of the ‘Followers of Homs’ (and the later
priests of Heliopolis) would have included an intense focus on the stellar
background at the vernal equinox and an understanding that the sun’s
‘journey’ towards Horakhti-Leo, as calibrated at this ‘governing moment’ of
the year., would by definition have been a journey backwards in time
through a succession of‘world-ages’ - i.e. from the Age of Taurus, circa
3000 BC (when the sun on the vernal equinox rose against the stellar
background of the constellation ofTaums) to the Age ofLeo, circa 10,500
BC, when the sun on the vernal equinox rose against the background ofthe
celestial lion.
So when we read in the Pyramid Texts that the ‘Followers ofHorns’ are
urging the Homs-King to travel from Taurus to Leo it is possible that
they may have had in mind something rather complex and clever. It is
possible, in other words, that as well as offering the sun’s annual path
through the constellations as a kind of ‘treasure trail’ for the initiate to
follow on his way to the breast of the Sphinx, they may also have offered
him knowledge of its slow reverse motion at the vernal equinox — perhaps as
his cue to embark on a different kind of journey, against the flow of
precession and back to the ‘First Time’.
This is more than speculation. As we saw at the end of Part III, the
Horus-King’s journey to the breast of the Sphinx was undertaken at the
summer solstice during the Pyramid Age (because in that epoch it was at the
summer solstice that the great conjunction of the sun with Horakhti-Leo



218 Map
occurred). We also saw, however, that the initiate who’had correctly
followed the ‘treasure trail’ set out in the texts, and who had reached the
Sphinx in the pre-dawn on the summer solstice, would immediately have
become aware of a curious ‘dislocation’ between sky and ground. He
would have noticed, in particular, that the Sphinx gazed due east but that
his celestial counterpart — Horakhti-Leo — was rising at a point on the
horizon located some 28 degrees north of due east. He would also have
noticed that the three great Pyramids of Giza precisely straddled the
meridian but that their terrestrial counterparts, the three stars of Orion’s
belt, hung low in the south-eastern portion of the pre-dawn sky, far to the
left of the meridian.
Given the profoundly astronomical character of his religious frame of
reference he might well have felt a numinous urge to ‘put sky and ground
together again’ - i.e., so to arrange matters that the Sphinx would be
gazing directly at Leo in the pre-dawn, whilst, at the same moment, the
three stars of Orion’s belt would straddle the meridian in the precise
pattern ‘specified’ by the meridional layout of the Pyramids. If that could
somehow be brought about then the monuments would truly represent ‘an
image of heaven’^ - as the old Hermetic doctrines teach - and the land of
Egypt which once was holy, a land which loved the gods and wherein
alone the gods deigned to sojourn on earth’, might once again become, as it
was before, ‘the teacher of Mankind’.^
But how could the Horus-King hope to unite sky and ground.?
The only way would be if he were equipped to use precession
presumably just as an intellectual tool — to travel backwards in time.
For as the reader will recall there was a time when a unique celestial
conjunction involving the moment of sunrise, the constellation of Leo,
and the meridian-transit of the three stars of Orion’s belt, did indeed
occur. That time, of course, was near the beginning of the Age of Leo, at
around 10,500 bc,’ some 8000 years prior to the Pyramid Age.
Becoming equipped
The Utterances conventionally numbered 471,472 and 473 in the ancient
Egyptian Pyramid Texts contain information of an extraordinary nature.
In view of the importance of this information, we set it out in full below;
I am the essence of a god, the son of a god, the messenger of a god, [says the

Horus-King]. The Followers of Horus cleanse me, they bathe me, they dry
me, they recite for me the Spell [formula] for Him who is on the Right Way,
they recite for me the Spell of Him who Ascends, and I ascend to the sky.
I will go aboard this Bark ofRe [the Solar Bark]. . . Every god will rejoice at
meeting me as they rejoice at meeting Re [the sun] when he ascends from the
eastern side of the sky in peace, in peace.
The sky quivers, the earth quakes before me, for I am a magician, I possess
magic ... I have come that I may glorify Orion, that I may set Osiris at the
head, that I may set the gods upon their thrones.
O Mahaf, Bull of the gods [Taurus-Hyades], bring me this [solar bark] and
set me on yonder side . . . The reed-floats ofthe sky are set down for me by the
day-bark that I [the solar Horus-King] may go up on them to Re at the



220 Map
Horizon. The reed floats of the sky are brought down to me by thb night bark that I may go up on them to Horakhti at the horizon. I go up on the eastern side
of the sky where the gods are bom, and I am born as Horus, as Him of the
Horizon ... I have found the Akhus with their mouths equipped . . .
‘Who are you.?’ say they [the Akhus\ with their mouths equipped. ‘I am an Akhu with my mouth equipped.’
‘How has this happened to you,’ say they, the Akhus with their mouths
equipped, ‘that you have come to this place more noble than any place.?’
‘I have come to this place more noble than any place because: The reed
floats of the sky were set down for Re [the sun disc and the emblem of the
Horus-King] that Re might cross [the Milky Way] on them to Horakhti at the Horizon .. .’ *
These Utterances appear to describe an important part of the Horus
King s initiatory journey — an ordeal of questions and answers based on
astronomical science wrapped up in esoteric symbols. The inquisitors are
the ‘Followers of Homs’, also known as the Akhus (the ‘Venerables’, the
‘Shining Ones’, the ‘Transfigured Spirits’, etc., etc.). Moreover, as we
would expect, the Homs-King’s cosmic journey begins in the Taurus
Hyades region of the sky, on the right bank of the Milky Way. and
proceeds along the ecliptic path to end at Leo i.e. ‘Horakhti’, at the
horizon. Here, at this place more noble than any place’, the Akhus greet
him - indeed he claims to have become an Akhu himself- and give him the
final instmetions or directions that he will need to complete his quest.
What we have to consider is the possibility that these final instructions
might somehow have equipped the Horus-King to make the necessary
journey back in time, to the ‘First Time’, and into the cosmic Kingdom of
Osiris when sky and ground were united in perfect harmony.
Unification
As the reader will recall from the previous chapter, the ‘Followers of
Horus were said to have possessed ‘a knowledge of divine origin’ that was
to be used to ‘unify the country’. It is therefore presumably of relevance
that large numbers of ancient Egyptian inscriptions and papyri make
reference to an event known as ‘the Uniting of the Two Lands’ - an event
that is eloquently related in the so-caUed Shabaka Texts (the ‘Memphite
Theology’) which we have reviewed in Part III.
It is the scholarly consensus that the ‘Unification ofthe Two Lands’ was
a political and economic ‘federation’ between southern and northern



Space-Time Co-ordinates 221
Egypt, resulting from the military conquest of the latter by the former,
which supposedly occurred at around the year 3000 BC.’ This conquest, as
T. G. H. James informs us, ‘was effected by a King known to history as
Menes. No contemporary monument bears a royal name that can with
certainty be read as Menes, but he is generally identified with King
Narmer who is shown wearing both the red and white crowns [respec¬
tively ofnorthern and southern Egypt] on a great palette [now in the Cairo
Museum]. With the unification of the Kingdoms begins the historic
period of Egypt.’
Also sometimes referred to as ‘King Scorpion’ (after a symbol that
appears on an archaic mace-head) we have already met Menes-Narmer."
We have noted, too, the strange Egyptological double standard by which
he is accorded the status of a genuine historical figure whilst his
predecessors - mentioned with equal prominence in the king-lists and
Manetho — are dismissed as ‘mythical beings’.
Indeed, Egyptologists speak with such immense confidence of ‘the
pohtical consolidation of Egypt around 3000 bc’ and of the ‘unification
under Narmer’ that one would suppose they were in possession of
bundles upon bundles of ancient treaties, land deeds and historical
records. The truth, however, as James half admits, is that nothing is
knovm for sure about the supposed first Pharaoh of the First Dynasty. On
the contrary, the whole of what we read about him, including his
identification with ‘Narmer’, is scholarly speculation based on idiosyn¬
cratic interpretations ofcertain scenes - some ofwhich depict battles - that
are carved on the so-called ‘Narmer Palette’ and on certain votive mace
heads from Hierakonpolis (an ancient religious capital in southern
Egypt).
In short, Egyptology’s case that ‘the Unification of the Two Lands’
refers to the political unification of northern and southern Egypt under
Menes rests on three completely uninscribed artefacts which are carved
with scenes that might bear such an interpretation - but that could also be
interpreted in many other ways. These curious artefacts tell us precious
little about Menes-Narmer himself,*'* let alone what his political and
territorial aspirations - or those of anybody else - might have been circa
3000 BC in Egypt. Semi-legendary or semi-historical, Narmer (or Menes
or ‘King Scorpion’ - take your pick) is thus the quintessential ‘King
Arthur’ ofEgyptology. And so, too, is his supposed ‘Unification of Egypt’



222 Map
- which is also veiled in semi-mythical, semi-historical confusion, very
much like the confederation of King Arthur’s Round Table.
Moreover the conclusion that Menes-Narmer was the first ruler to have
been involved in the ‘Unification of the Two Lands’ clashes rudely with
the beliefs of the ancient Egyptians themselves. Their records and
traditions make it clear that there had been earlier ‘Unifications’ in the
‘Time of the Gods’ - all going back to the original Kingdom of Osiris, the
‘Kingdom ofthe “First Time” ’ which was tom asunder by Seth and then
unified once again by Homs.
We do not thmk that this talk of‘Unification’ was ever entirely to do
with events that happened on the ground. Although we do not dispute that
some form ofpolitical unification did indeed take place at around 3000 bc,
we suspect that in dualistic Egypt a wider understanding ofthe whole issue
will not be possible unless events in the sky are taken into account as well.
Building on earlier work done by Egyptologist and archaeoastronomer
Jane B. Sellers,*'^ we suggest that the original notion of‘Unification’ - to
which all later attempts to ‘Unify the Two Lands’ were directly related
had something to 'do with the precessional drift of the stars . . .
High and far-off times
In her landmark study The Death ofGods in Ancient Egypt Sellers sets out
persuasive astronomical and textual evidence to show that the prehistoric
Egyptians - at least as far back as 7300 bc - had observed and tracked the
slow precessionally induced changes that constantly relocate the cosmic
address of the constellation of Orion. And she argues that, although
political unity was credited to Menes, there was a much older notion ofthe
‘Unification’ based not on events on earth but those observed in the
sky . . f Indeed, she goes so far as to claim that Menes merely brought to
fmition a very ancient and archetypal vision of cosmic duality which so
perfectly harmonized with the mentality of the ancient Egyptians ‘as to
appear both inevitable and perennial’: ‘A dual monarchy united under the
mle ofone was a form that came from the mists of distant antiquity. It was
a form that had been created for gods in the heavens, and how inevitable it
was that an imitation of the cosmic order should prevail for men on earth.’ ’*
Sellers supports her case by drawing on the late Henri Frankfort’s



Space—Time Co-ordinates 223
studies of ancient Egyptian kingship. Like her, the former Professor of
Preclassical Antiquity at the University of London was firmly of the
opinion that it was ‘possible to view the unification of Egypt, not as the
ephemeral outcome of conflicting ambitions, but as the revelation of a
predestined order’.'’ And he was further convinced that ‘the dual
monarchy centred round Memphis realized a divine plan’, that the social
and state order established by Menes-Narmer was presented ‘as part ofthe
cosmic order’,^® and that Menes-Narmer, in establishing himself as sole
ruler of Upper and Lower Egypt, was performing ‘an act in harmony with
the Egyptian tendency to understand the world in dualistic terms, “a
series of pairs of contrasts balanced in unchanging equilibrium” . . .’ ^'
What Sellers was able to add to this, as a result of her own powerful
insights into ancient Egyptian cosmology and observational astronomy,
was the notion that events taking place on the ground were somehow
directly conditioned by observations of the sky - and also that what was
observed in the sky was described more or less accurately in certain
‘myths’:
I am posmlating the creation of specific myths to deal with distressing
alterations in the sky, followed by an artificial duality, or symmetry, imposed,
not just on the deities, but on geographical centres ofworship, and this duality
remained a constant in Egyptian affairs throughout its history. It was harking
back to a wonderful Golden Age, now lost, an age when the skies had had a
magnificent balance, and the religion had been fresh and new . . “
The Golden Age to which Sellers is referring is, of course, Zep Tepi, the
‘First Time’. And the ‘distressing alterations in the sky’ which she believes
that certain myths were created to explain were caused by the phenom¬
enon of precession - specifically the precessional drift of the great
constellation of Orion away from the station that it had occupied at the
‘First Time’.^^
These are daring and dangerous steps for an otherwise orthodox
Egyptologist to have taken. Nevertheless, as we shall see in the next
chapters. Sellers could be wrong in understanding the myths - by which
she means principally the Pyramid Texts and the Memphite Theology
merely as accounts fabricated by superstitious priests to ‘explain’
precessional drift. The possibility needs to be confronted square on that
elements of these ancient traditions, and the monuments and rituals that
are so inextricably linked to them, could have been deliberately contrived



224 Map
as vehicles to carry an elaborate and ingenious ‘message’ from a past epoch
otherAvise long forgotten to a specific epoch in the future - from the ‘First
Time’ to an astronomically defined ‘Last Time’ - perhaps even to the
very epoch in which we ourselves live today. Perhaps both epochs thus
linked together are susceptible to accurate dating and decoding if only the
right key can be found. And perhaps we may yet be able to read and
understand the great cosmic blueprint that the ‘Followers of Homs’ sought to implement. . .
Who knows what might result.?
There might even come, to quote the words of Giorgio de Santillana,
some kind of Renaissance” out of the hopelessly condemned and
trampled past, when certain ideas come to life again . . . W^e should not
deprive our grandchildren of a last chance at the heritage of the highest and farthest-off times.’



Chapter 15
When the Sky Joined the Earth
‘My Kingdom is not of this world.. .
John 18:36
‘Great is the Cosmic Order, for it has not
changed since the time of Osiris, who put it
there . .
Ptahotep, a high priest of the Pyramid Age
According to the Creation narrative of the ancient Egyptians, Nut, the
Sky-goddess, and Geb, the earth-god, joined in sexual union, but were
then rudely separated by the intervention of Shu, the god of air,
atmosphere and dryness. Nevertheless the union did produce offspring in
the form of Isis and Osiris, Nepthys and Seth. And in due course, as we
have seen, Osiris became the ruler of the ideahzed ‘Kingdom of the “First
Time” ’, was murdered by Seth, experienced resurrection, and then
finally ascended into the heavens where he established the cosmic
‘IGngdom’ of the Duat. The reader will remember that a crucial role in
effecting his ‘astral rebirth’ was played by Horus, his son by the widow
Isis, the archetype for all the historical Horus-Kings of ancient Egypt
who revenged himself on Seth and later reunified the divided Kingdom.
It can thus be said that a kind of cosmic blueprint to establish - or re¬
establish — a unified ‘ICingdom of Osiris’ on earth had been devised from
the outset by the ‘gods’ and thus long before the advent of ‘historical’
kingship by Menes-Narmer at the beginning of the third millennium BC.
Separation
In the Shabaka Texts (which express the Memphite Theology) we read
that the defeat ofSeth by Horus was followed by a convocation ofthe gods,
under the leadership of Geb, who sat in judgement over the two



226 Map
‘contenders’. Initially each one was given authority to rule •over his own
area: ‘These are the words of Geb to Horus [of the north] and Seth [ofthe
south]: “I have separated you” - Lower and Upper Egypt. . . Then
Horus stood over one region and Seth stood over one region . . '
Later, however, as the reader will recall from Part III, Geb ‘gave to
Horus [Seth’s] inheritance’: ‘Then Horus stood over the land. He is the
uniter ofthis land ... He is Horus who arose as king of Upper and Lower
Egypt, who united the Two Lands in [the region of Memphis], the
“place” where the Two Lands were united . . .’ ^
The curious phrase ‘I have separated you’ which Geb uttered, is
symbolic of the ‘separation’ that he, too, had endured from his consort the
sky-goddess. Nut. With this in mind, should we not consider the
possibility that the notions of ‘Upper Egypt’ and and ‘Lower Egypt’
though obviously relating at one level to the geographical south and north
of the earthly country - might also at another level have been intended to
suggest ground and sky}
Doubles
There is much in the Memphite Theology which supports the proposition
that the areas which were traditionally regarded as the southern and
northern sacred regions ofOsiris — Abydos and Memphis — were not only
meant to be considered in terrestrial terms but also in cosmic terms.
In particular, a metaphor is relayed around the imagery of the huge
‘body’ of Osiris ‘drifting’ with the waters of the Nile from his southern
shrine at Abydos to reach his northern shrine in the ‘land of Sokar’ - i.e.
the Memphite necropolis in general and in particular the Giza plateau
where, in the form of the three great Pyramids, we suspect that the ‘body’
of Osiris lies outstretched upon the sand to the present day . . .
At any rate, this same basic imagery of Osiris lying on the western bank
ofthe Nile near Memphis also crops up in the Pyramid Texts, which add a
further clue: ‘They [Isis and Nepthys] have found Osiris . .. “when his
name became Sokar”.. .’ ^ The term ‘when his name became Sokar’ does
clearly seem to imply that the ‘body’ of Osiris merged with the land of
Sokar i.e. the Memphite necropolis, and that his image - i.e. the ‘astral’
image of the Orion region of the sky - was somehow grafted onto it. The



When the Sky Joined the Earth 227
impression that this ‘image’ must have something to do with the Pyramids
of Giza is then confirmed elsewhere in the Pyramid Texts. In the following
passage, for example, the Horus-King addresses the ‘Lower Sky’ to which
he ‘will descend to the place where the gods are’ and utters this powerful
and cryptic declaration:
If I come with my ka [double], open your arms to me; the mouths of the gods
will be opened and will request that I ascend to the sky, and I will ascend.
A boon which Geb (earth) and Atum grant: that this Pyramid and Temple be
installed for me and for my double, and that this Pyramid and Temple be enclosed for me and for my double . ..
As for anyone who shall lay a finger on this Pyramid and this Temple which
belong to me and to my double, he will have laid a finger on the Mansion
[Kingdom] . . . which is in the sky ..
It is beyond the scope of this book to present a detailed treatise on the
concept of the ka - the ‘double’, the astral or spiritual essence of a person
or thing - and of its role in ancient Egyptian funerary beliefs. Much
confusion has been generated around this important subject.’ At the very
least, however, it is certain that what confronts us in the ka is yet another
example of the prevailing dualism in Egyptian thought. Moreover its use
in context of the utterance quoted above reminds us that the ‘image’ of
Osiris ‘when his name became Sokar’ — i.e. the Memphite Pyramid
necropolis - should at all times be considered as having a cosmic or
celestial ‘double’. And it should be obvious, too, that this ‘double’ can only
be the Osirian Kingdom in the which the Pyramid Texts declare to
be ‘the Place Where Orion Is’. Indeed as Margaret Bunson notes in her
Encyclopaedia ofAncient Egypt: ^Kas . . . served as guardians of places . . .
Osiris was always called the ka of the Pyramids . . . ’ ^
Other passages from the Pyramid Texts support this general analysis:
O Horus, this King is Osiris, this Pyramid of the king is Osiris, this
construction of his is Osiris, betake yourself to it. .
Awake [Osiris] for Horus . .. spiritualize yourself [i.e. become an astral
being]. . . May a stairway to the sky be set up for you to the Place Where
Orion Is .. .*
Live, be alive, be young ... beside Orion in the sky . . .’
O Osiris-King, you are this great star, the companion of Orion, who
traverses the sky with Orion, who ‘sails’ in the Dual with Osiris . . .“*



228 Map
Link-up
Strangely, despite the obvious sky-ground dualism and profoundly
astronomical ‘flavour’ of the Texts, no scholar other than Jane B. Sellers"
has ever given serious consideration to the possibility that references to the
‘Unification’ of the ‘Upper’ and ‘Lower’ Kingdoms of Osiris might have
something to do with astronomy. Indeed the only Egyptologist even to get
close to such an unorthodox way of thinking was Selim Hassan when he
observed; ‘the Egyptians held the idea of the existence of more than one
sky, possibly superimposed . . . Certain lines in the Pyramid Texts
strongly suggest that “Upper” and “Lower” Egypt each had its own
particular sky . . . i.e. the two skies in opposition to the Two Lands of
Upper and Lower Egypt.’ "
In his monumental study of ancient Egyptian cosmology, Hassan also
drew attention to an intriguing papyrus, now kept at the Louvre Museum
in Paris," which suggests that the ‘Two Skies’ in question were considered
as being ‘one for the earth and the other for the Duaf}* ‘These plural
skies’, wrote Hassan, ‘were superimposed one above the other.’"
Pursuing such lines of thought, we were to discover that similar ideas
are depicted in the Coffin Texts. There reference is made to the ‘Upper’
and ‘Lower’ landscapes which are said to be bound to the ‘Two Horizons’
- one in the east (the sky) and one in the west (the earth i.e. the Memphite
necropolis*^): ‘Open! O Sky and Earth, O eastern and western Horizons,
open you chapels of Upper and Lower Egypt ...’*’
The language of all these texts is exotic, laden with the dualistic
thinking that lay at the heart ofancient Egyptian society and that may have
been the engine of its greatest achievements. In the Pyramid Age, as we
have seen, the gigantic ‘image’ of Osiris appears to have been physically
defined on the ground with the creation of the ‘Lower’ landscape of the
Memphite Pyramids - a development referred to in the Pyramid Texts by
means ofthe obvious metaphor ‘When his name became Sokar’. Likewise,
it should come as no surprise that the gigantic celestial ‘image’ of Osiris in
the sky is referred to in the same texts by means of the same metaphorical
device, i.e. ‘When his name became Orion’: ‘Horus comes, Thoth
appears .. . They raise Osiris from upon his side and make him stand up
. . . when there came into being this his name of Orion, long of leg and
leng^y of stride, who presides over “Upper” Egypt. . . Raise yourself, O
Osiris . . . the sky is given to you, the earth is given to you ...’** Selim



When the Sky Joined the Earth 229
57. (Left) The sVy-Duat of Osiris ‘in his name of Orion’.
(Right) The ground-ZJwar of Osiris ‘in his name of Sokar’.
Hassan, again almost but not quite getting the point, comments as follows:
‘this line shows that Osiris was given the dominion of heaven and earth.’*’
Yet clearly there is more to say. These ‘dominions’ were by no means
vague and general but were defined in the sky by the pattern of Orion’s
stars, and were defined on the ground - in the land of ‘Sokar’ (i.e the
Memphite necropolis) - by the pattern of the Pyramids.
We wonder whether the first major ‘station’ of the quest-joumey of the
Horus-King, reached after he had been prompted to ‘find the astral body
of Osiris’, might not have been the initiate’s dawning awareness that the
body in question was a duality that could only be approached by linking
Orion with the pattern ofthe Great Pyramids in the Memphite necropolis.

Riding the vernal point
The reader will remember that the starting point of the Horus-King’s
‘journey in the sky’ was when the sun’s position along the zodiac (during
the solar year) was close to the Hyades, at the ‘head’ of the constellation of
Taurus, standing, as it were, on the banks of the Milky Way.
If we now transpose this sky image to the ground then the Horus-King
would have to place himself near the ‘Bent’ and the ‘Red’ Pyramids of
Dahshur some 20 miles south of Giza (but nevertheless still very much
part of the extensive Memphite necropolis). As we saw in the last chapter,
the trigger for the construction of these two Fourth-Dynasty monuments
appears to have been the slow processional drift ofthe vernal point into the
Hyades-Taurus region of the sky in the third millennium bc. Indeed it is
more than possible that by building those Pyramids (which map the two
brightest stars in the Hyades) Pharaoh Sneferu (2575—2551 bc) was
dehberately laying down a marker for the position ofthe vernal point in his epoch.
If he was doing that, as all the evidence seems to suggest, then it is
probable that such a highly initiated Horus-King would also have known
that by metaphorically ‘boarding’ the solar bark at the spring equinox^ and
crossing the Milky Way, he would effectively be ‘sailing back in time’
against the flow of precession — riding the vernal point towards the distant
constellation of Leo.
But why, then, all this parallel emphasis in the texts on Orion-Osiris
moving from somewhere in the distant ‘south’ to his flnal resting place in
the Memphite necropolis.^
Secret spell
We suspect that for thousands of years before the Pyramid Age, hundreds
of generations of Heliopolitan astronomer-priests had kept the constella¬
tion of Orion continuously under observation, paying particular attention
to its place ofmeridian-transit - i.e. the altitude above the horizon at which
it crossed the celestial meridian. We think that careful records were kept,
perhaps written, perhaps orally encoded in the ancient ‘mythological’
language of precessional astronomy.^** And we suppose that note was taken
of Orion s slow precessional drift — the effect of which was that the



When the Sky Joined the Earth 231
constellation would have seemed to be slowly drifting northwards along the west
'bank' ofthe Milky Way.
It is our hypothesis that the mythical image of the vast body of Osiris
slowly being carried to the north, i.e. ‘drifting’ on the waters ofthe Nile, is
a specific piece of astronomical terminology coined to describe the long¬
term changes being effected by precession in Orion’s celestial ‘address’. In
the Memphite Theology, as the reader will recall, this drift was depicted as
having commenced in the south, symbolically called Abydos (in archaeo¬
logical terms the most southerly ‘shrine’ ofOsiris), and to have carried the
‘body’ ofthe dead god to a point in the north symbolically called Sokar, i.e.
the Memphite necropolis (the most northerly ‘shrine’ of Osiris). As we
saw in Part III, the Shabaka Texts tell us that when he reached this point:
Osiris was drowned in his water. Isis and Nepthys looked out, beheld him, and
attended to him. Horus quickly commanded Isis and Nepthys to grasp Osiris
and prevent his [submerging]. They heeded in time and brought him to land.
He entered the hidden portals in the glory of the Lords of Eternity. Thus
Osiris came into the earth at the Royal Fortress [Memphis], to the north ofthe
land to which he had come [Abydos].^'
58. The effect of Orion’s slow precessional slide up the meridian between 10,500 BC and 2500
BC is that the constellation would literally have appeared to be ‘drifting’ very slowly northwards
along the course of the Milky Way.



232 Map
In the light of what we now know it is hard to imagine that the reference to
Osiris coming ‘into the earth’ (or down to earth?) could signify anything
other than thephysical construction ofthe ‘body of Osiris on the ground’ on
the west banks of the Nile - in the form of the great Pyramid-fields of the
sprawling Memphite necropolis. Since Osiris is Orion the desire to
achieve such an effect would more than adequately explain why the three
Pyramids of Giza should have been arranged in the pattern of the three
stars of Orion’s belt. Moreover, since we know that the stated goal of the
Horus-King’s quest was not only to find the astral ‘body’ of Osiris but to
find it as it was in the ‘First Time’, we should not be surprised by the fact
that the Pyramids, as we saw in Part I, are set out on the ground in the
pattern that they made at the beginning (i.e. ‘southernmost point’) of that
constellation’s upward (i.e. ‘northerly’) precessional half-cycle.
So we wonder whether it is possible that the quest of the Horus-King
might have had as its ultimate objective the acquisition of knowledge
concerning the 'First Time'' - perhaps even the acquisition of specific
knowledge^om that remote epoch when the gods had walked the earth?
Several passages in the Pyramid Texts invite such speculation. For
example, we are told that the Horus-King must ‘travel upstream’ - i.e.
must push against the natural drift of ‘time’ - in order to reach Orion
Osiris in his proper ‘First Time’ setting:
Betake yourself to the Waterway, fare upstream [south], travel about Abydos
in this spirit-form of yours which the gods command to belong to youj may a
stairway [road] to the Duat be set up for you to the Place Where Orion Is . .
They have found Osiris . . . ‘When his name became Sokar’ [Memphite
necropolis]. . . Wake up [Osiris] for Horus . . . raise yourself . . . fare
southward [upstream] to the lake, cross over the sea [sky], for you are he who
stands untiring in the midst of Abydos . .
Betake yourself to the Waterway, fare upstream . . . traverse Abydos. The
celestial portal to the Horizon is open to you . . . may you remove yourself to
the sky, for the roads of the celestial expanses which lead up to Horus are
cleaned for you ... for you have traversed the Winding Waterway [Milky
Way] which is in the north ofthe sky as a star crossing the sea which is beneath
the sky. The Duat has grasped your hand at the Place Where Orion Is . .
Likewise there is a striking passage in the Coffin Texts which refers to
some secret spell or formula to allow the deceased to use the ‘path of
Rostau on the land and in the sky (i.e. the path to the Giza necropolis on



When the Sky Joined the Earth 233
land and to Orion’s belt in the sky) in order to ‘go down to any sky he
wishes to go down to’:
I have passed on the path of Rostau, whether on water or on land, and these are
the paths of Osiris [Orion], they are in the limit of the sky. As for him who
knows the spell [formula] for going down into them, he himselfis a god in the
suite of Thoth [meaning he is as wise as Thoth, ‘the controller of the stars’^^]
[and] he will go down to any sky he wishes to go down to . .
Special numbers
We suspect that the phrase to ‘go down to any sky’ suggests an awareness
and recording — of precessionally induced changes in the positions of the
stars over long periods of time. And we also note its implication that if the
chosen initiate was equipped with the correct numerical spell then he
would be able to work out - and visualize — the correct positions of the
stars in any epoch of his choosing, past or future.
Once again Sellers stands out amongst Egyptologists for being the first
to have entertained such apparently outlandish notions. ‘It is possible’, she
writes, ‘that early man encoded in his myths special numbers; numbers
that seemed to reveal to initiates an amazing knowledge of the movement
of the celestial spheres.’
Such numbers, she argues, appear to have been derived from a
sustained, scientific study of the cycle of precession and a measurement of
its rate and, puzzlingly, turn out to be extremely ‘close to the calculations
made with today’s sophisticated procedures’. Intriguingly, too, there is
evidence not only ‘that these calculations were made, and conclusions
drawn’, but also that ‘they were transmitted to others by secret encoding
that was accessible only to an elite few’:^ In short. Sellers concludes,
‘ancient man calculated a special number that he believed would bring this
threatening cycle [of precession] back to its starting point. .
The ‘special number’ to which Sellers is referring to is 25,920 (and
multiples and divisions of it) and thus represents the duration, in solar
years, ofa full processional cycle or ‘Great Year’.^** She shows how it can be
derived from a variety of simple combinations of other numbers - 5, 12,
36, 72, 360, 432, 2160, etc., etc. - all of which are in turn derived from
precise observations of precession. Most crucially ofall, she shows that this
peculiar sequence of numbers occurs in the ancient Egyptian myth of Osiris



234 Map
where, notably ‘72 consipirators’ are said to have been involved with Seth
in the murder of the God-King.^'
As was shown in Fingerprints ofthe Gods^ the sun’s perceived motion
through the signs ofthe zodiac at the vernal equinox proceeds at the rate of
one degree every seventy-two years. From this it follows that a movement
ofthe vernal point through 30 degrees will take 2160 years to complete, 60
degrees will take 4320 years, and a full 360-degree cycle will require
25,920 years.^^
Curiously enough, as the reader will recall from Part I, the Great
Pyramid itself incorporates a record ofthese precessional numbers — since
its key dimensions (its height and the perimeter of its base) appear to have
been designed as a mathematical model of the earth’s polar radius and
equatorial circumference on a scale of 1:43,200. The number 43,200 is, of
course, exactly 600 times 72. What we have in this remarkable monument,
therefore, is not just a scale model ofa hemisphere ofthe earth but also one
in which the scale involved incorporates a ‘special number’ derived from
one of the key planetary motions of the earth itself- i.e. the rate ofits axial precession.
In short it seems that secret knowledge is indeed available in the myth of
Osiris and in the dimensions of the Great Pyramid. With this secret
knowledge, ifwe wanted to fix a specific date - say 1008 years in the future
- and communicate it to other initiates, then we could do so with the
special number 14 (72 x 14 = 1008). We would also have to specify the
‘zero point’ from which they were to make their calculations - i.e. the
present epoch - and this might be done with some kind of symbolic or
mathematical marker to indicate where the vernal point presently is, i.e.
moving out of Pisces and into Aquarius.
A similar exercise could likewise be carried out in reverse. By following
the ‘eastwards’ direction along the ecliptic path we can ‘find’ (calculate,
work out) where the vernal point was at any epoch in the past. Thus if
today we wished to use the precessional code to direct attention towards
the Pyramid Age we would need to confide to other initiates the ‘special
number of 62.5 (72 x 62.5 = 4500 years ago = approximately 2500 Bc).
Again, we could rule out any ambiguity as to the zero date from which the
calculations were to be made if we could find a way to indicate the present
position of the vernal point.
We have seen that this is what Sneferu appears to have done with the



When the Sky Joined the Earth 235
two Pyramids at Dahshur, which map the two sides of the head of the
celestial bull - the ‘address’ ofthe vernal point iii his epoch. And in a sense,
though with a great deal more specificity and precision, this could also be
exactly what the builders of the Great Pyramid were doing when they
deliberately targeted the southern shafts of the King’s and Queen’s
Chambers on the meridian-transits of such significant stars as Orion and
Sirius in the epoch of 2500 bc. To be clear about this, it seems to us well
worth investigating the possibility that by setting up such obvious and
precise ‘time markers’ they were trying to provide an unambiguous zero
point - circa 2500 BC - for calculations that could only be undertaken by
initiates steeped in the mysteries of precession, who were equipped by
their training to draw out the hidden portents concealed in certain ‘special
numbers’.
We note in passing that if the Horus-King could have been provided
with the ‘special number’ 111.111, and had used it in the way described
above, it would have led him back to (72 x 111.111 years =) 7,999.99 years
before the specified ‘ground zero’, i.e. to almost exactly 8000 years before
2500 BC - in short, to 10,500 bc.
We know this seems like wishful numerology of the worst sort - i.e.
‘factoring in’ an arbitrary value to a set of calculations so as to procure
spurious ‘corroboration’ for a specific desired date (in this case the date of
10,500 BC, twelve and a half thousand years before the present, that we
have already highlighted in Chapter 3 in connection with the Sphinx and
the Pyramids of Giza). The problem, however, is that the number 111.111
may well not be an arbitrary value. At any rate, it has long been recognized
that the main numerical factor in the design of the Great Pyramid, and
indeed ofthe Giza necropolis as a whole, is the prime number 11 - a prime
number being one that is only divisible by itself to produce the whole
number i. Thus 11 divided by 11, i.e. the ratio 11:11, produces the whole
number i (while 11 divided by anything else, i.e. any other ratio, would, of
neccessity, generate a fraction).
What is intriguing is the way that the architecture of the Great Pyramid
responds to the number 11 when it is divided, or multiplied, by other
whole numbers. The reader will recall, for example, that its side length of
just over 755 feet is equivalent to 440 Egyptian royal cubits - i.e. 11 times
40 cubits.^^ In addition, its height-to-base ratio is 7:11 The slope ratio of
its sides is 14:11 (tan 51 degrees 50').^’ And the slope ratio of the sputhem



2j6 Map
shaft ofthe King’s Chamber - the shaft that was targeted on Orion’s belt in
2500 BC - is I i:n (tan 45 degrees).^^
Arguably, therefore, the ratio i i:i i, which integrates with our ‘special
number’ in. in, could be considered as a sort of mathematical key, or
stargate’ to Orion’s belt. Moreover, as we shall see, a movement of
ni.ni degrees ‘backwards along the ecliptic from ‘ground-zero’ at the
Hyades-Xaurus, the head ofthe celestial bull, would place the vernal point
‘underneath’ the cosmic lion.
Is it not precisely such a location, underneath the Great Sphinx, that the
Horus-King is urged to investigate as he stands between its paws ‘with his
mouth equipped and faces the questions of the Akhus whose initiations
have led him this far.? Indeed, does it not seem probable that the ‘quest
journey’ devised by the ‘Followers ofHorus’ was carefully structured so as
to sharpen the mind of the initiate by requiring him to piece together all
the clues himself until he finally arrived at the realization that somewhere
underneath the Great Sphinx of Giza was something (written or pictorial
records, artefacts, maps, astronomical charts) that touched on ‘the
knowledge of a divine origin’, that was of immense importance, and that
had been concealed there since the ‘First Time’.?
In considering such questions, we are reminded of the Hermetic
doctrines which transmit a tradition of the wisdom god Thoth who was
said to have ‘succeeded in understanding the mysteries ofthe heavens [and
to have] revealed them by inscribing them in sacred books which he then
hid here on earth, intending that they should be searched for by future
generations but found only by the fully worthy’.^’ Do the ‘sacred books of
Thoth’, or their equivalent, still lie in the bedrock beneath the Great
Sphinx of Giza, and do the ‘fully worthy’ still seek them there.?
Seekers after truth
Other questions, too, have been raised implicitly and explicitly in the foregoing chapters:
1 Were the Great Sphinx and the great Pyramids of Giza designed to
serve as parts of an immense three-dimensional ‘model’ of the sky of the ‘First Time’.?
2 Could other features of the necropolis also be part of this model.?
3 If so, then has enough survived for us to compare the model with



When the Sky Joined the Earth 237
computer simulations of the skies above Giza in previous epochs and
thus arrive at an accurate archaeoastronomical dating for the ‘First
Time’, i.e. for the true ‘genesis’ of the extraordinary civilization of
Egypt?
4 By looking at simulations of the ancient skies would we not, to use
the language of the Egyptian funerary texts, be ‘going down to any
sky we wished to go down to’?
5 Is it an accident that so many of these texts have survived for
thousands of years, or could their compilers have intended them to
survive and carefully designed them in such a way that human nature
would ensure their copying and recopying down the ages (a process
that has been promiscuously resumed in the last century and a half,
since the decipherment of the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, with the
Coffin Texts, the Pyramid Texts, the Book of the Dead, etc., etc.,
now translated and reprinted in dozens of modem languages and
editions - and even available on CD-ROM)?
6 In other words, is it not possible in our readings of the texts, and in
our analysis of the rituals to which they were linked, that we have
stumbled upon a message of primordial antiquity that was composed
not just for the Pyramid Age, and not just for the Horus-Kings of
ancient Egypt, but for all ‘seekers after the truth’ - from any culture,
in any epoch - who might be ‘equipped’ to put texts and monuments
together and to view the skies of former times?



Chapter i6
Message in a Bottle?
‘We have reached this fascinating point in
our evolution ... we have reached the time
when we know we can talk to each other
across the distances between the stars ...’
Dr John Billingham, NASA Ames Research
Center, 1995
Together with the ancient texts and rituals that are linked to them, could
the vast monuments ofthe Oiza necropolis have been designed to transmit
a message from one culture to another — a message not across space, but across time.?
Egyptologists reply to such questions by rolling their eyes and hooting
derisively. Indeed they would not be ‘Egyptologists’ (or at any rate they
could not long remain within that profession) ifthey reacted with anything
other than scorn and disbelief to suggestions that the necropolis might be
more than a cemetery, that the Great Sphinx might significantly predate
the epoch of 2500 bc, and that the Pyramids might not be just ‘royal
tombs’. By the same token, no self-respecting Egyptologist would be
prepared to consider, even for a moment, the outlandish possibility that
some sort of mysterious ‘message’ might have been encoded into the monuments.
So whom should we turn to for advice when confronted by what we
suspect may be a message from a civilization so far distant from us in time
as to be almost unknowable.?
Anti-cipher
The only scientists actively working on such problems today are those
involved in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence - SETI for short.
They endlessly sweep the heavens for messages from distant civilizations

and they have therefore naturally had to give some thought to what might
happen if they ever did identify such a message. According to Dr Philip
Morisson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology:
To begin with we would know very little about it. If we received it we would
not understand what we’re getting. But we would have an unmistakable signal,
full of structure, full of challenge. The best people would try to decode it, and
it will be easy to do because those who have constructed it would have made it
easy to decode, otherwise there’s no point. This is anti-cryptography: ‘I want
to make a message for you, who never got in touch with any symbols of mine,
no key no clue, nevertheless you’ll be able to read it. . .’ I would have to fill it
full of clues and unmistakable clever devices .. .'
In his book, Cosmos, Professor Carl Sagan of Cornell University makes
much the same point — and does so, curiously enough, with reference to
the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic system. He explains that the ‘Egyptian
hieroglyphics are, in significant part, a simple substitution cipher. But not
every hieroglyph is a letter or syllable. Some are pictographs . . .’ When it
came to translation, this ‘mix of letters and pictographs caused some grief
for interpreters . . In the early nineteenth century, however, a break¬
through was made by the French scholar Champollion who deciphered
the famous ‘Rosetta Stone’, a slab of black basalt bearing identical
inscriptions in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in Greek. Since Champollion
could read the Greek, all he needed was some kind of‘key’ to relate specific
hieroglyphs to specific Greek words or letters. This key was provided by
the constant repetition in the Greek text of the name of Pharaoh Ptolemy
V and an equal number of repetitions in the Egyptian text of a distinctive
oblong enclosure - known as a cartouche - containing a repeated group of
hieroglyphs. As Sagan comments:
The cartouches were the key . . . almost as though the Pharaohs of Egypt had
circled their own names to make the going easier for Egyptologists two
thousand years in the future. . . What a joy it must have been [for
Champollion] to open this one-way communication channel with another
civilization, to permit a culture that had been mute for millennia to speak ofits
history, magic, medicine, rehgion, politics and philosophy.^
Professor Sagan then offers a comparison that is highly apposite to our
present inquiry. ‘Today,’ he says:
we are again seeking messages from an ancient and exotic civilization, this time
hidden from us not only in time, but in space. If we should receive a radio



240 Map
message from an extraterrestrial civilization, how could it»possibly be
understood? Extraterrestrial intelligence will be elegant, complex, internally
consistent and utterly alien. Extraterrestrials would, of course, wish to make a
message sent to us as comprehensible as possible. But how could they? Is there
in any sense an interstellar Rosetta Stone? We believe there is a common
language that all technical civilizations, no matter how different, must have.
That common language is science and mathematics. The laws of Nature are
the same everywhere.^
It seems to us that ifthere is indeed a very ancient ‘message’ at Giza then it
is likely to be expressed in the language of science and mathematics that
Sagan identifies — and for the same reason. Moreover, given its need to
continue ‘transmitting’ coherently across thousands of years (and chasms
of cultural change), we think that the composer of such a message would
be likely to make use ofthe Precession ofthe Equinoxes, the one particular
‘law of Nature’ that can be said to govern, and measure - and identify
long periods of terrestrial time.
Durable vehicles
The Pyramids and the Great Sphinx at Giza are, above all else, as elegant,
as complex, as internally consistent and as utterly ‘alien’ as the
extraterrestrial intelligence that Sagan envisages (alien in the sense of the
tremendous, almost superhuman scale of these structures and of their
uncanny — and in our terms apparently unnecessary - precision).
Moreover, returning briefly to Dr Philip Morisson’s remarks quoted
earlier, we think that the Giza necropolis also qualifies rather well for the
description packed full ofclues and unmistakable clever devices’.^ Indeed,
it seems to us that a truly astonishing quantum of ingenuity was invested
by the Pyramid builders to ensure that the four fundamental aspects of an
‘unmistakable’ message were thoroughly elaborated here:
1 the creation of durable, unequivocal markers which could serve as
beacons to inflame the curiosity and engage the intelligence of future
generations of seekers;
2 the use of the ‘common language’ of processional astronomy;
3 the use of processional co-ordinates to signal specific time-referents
linking past to present and present to future;
4 Cunningly concealed store-rooms, or ‘Halls of Records’ that could
only be found and entered by those who were fully initiated in the



Message in a Bottle? 241
‘silent language’ and thus could read and follow its clues.
In addition, though the monuments are enabled to ‘speak’ from the
moment that their astronomical context is understood, we have also to
consider the amazing profusion of funerary texts that have come down to
us from all periods ofEgyptian history - all apparently emanating from the
same very few common sources.^ As we have seen, these texts operate like
‘software’ to the monuments’ ‘hardware’, charting the route that the
Horus-King (and all other future seekers) must follow.
We recall a remark made by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von
Dechend in Hamlet's Mill to the effect that the great strength of myths as
vehicles for specific technical information is that they are capable of
transmitting that information independently of the knowledge of individ¬
ual story-tellers.^ In other words as long as a myth continues to be told
true, it will also continue to transmit any higher message that may be
concealed within its structure - even if neither the teller nor the hearer
understands that message.
So, too, we suspect, with the ancient Egyptian funerary texts. We
would be surprised if the owners of many of the coffins and tomb walls
onto which they were copied had even the faintest inkling that specific
astronomical observations and directions were being duplicated at their
expense. What motivated them was precisely what the texts offered - the
lure ofimmortal life. Yet by taking that lure did they not in fact guarantee a
kind of immortality for the texts themselves? Did they not ensure that so
many faithful copies would be made that some at least would be bound to
survive for many thousands of years?
We think that there were always people who understood the true
‘science of immortality’ connected to the texts, and who were able to read
the astronomical allegories in which deeper secrets, not granted to the
common herd, lay concealed. We presume that these people were once
called the ‘Followers of Horns’, that they operated as an invisible college
behind the scenes in Egyptian prehistory and history, that their primary
cult centre was at Giza-Heliopolis, and that they were responsible for the
initiation of kings and the realization of blueprints. We also think that the
timetables they worked to - and almost everything ofsignificance that they
did - was in one way or another written in the stars.

Hints and memories
The powerfully astronomical character of the Giza necropolis, although
ignored by Egyptologists, has been recognized by open-minded and
intuitive researchers throughout history. The Hermetic Neoplatonists of
Alexandria, for example, appear to have been acutely sensitive to the
possibility of a ‘message’ and were quick to discern the strong astral
qualities of the textual material and the monuments.’ The scholar Proclus
(fifth century ad) also acknowledged that the Great Pyramid was
astronomically designed — and with certain specific stars in mind. Indeed,
in his commentary on Plato’s Timaeus (which deals with the story of the
lost civilization of ‘Atlantis’), Proclus reported strangely that ‘the Great
Pyramid was used as an observation for Sirius’.*
Vague memories of an astronomically constructed ‘message’ at Giza
appear to have filtered down to the Middle Ages. At any rate the Arab
chroniclers in this period spoke of the Great Pyramid as ‘a temple to the
stars’ and frequently connected it to the Biblical ‘Flood’ which they dated
to circa 10,300 BC.’ Also of relevance is a report written by the Arab
geographer Yakut al Hamawi (eleventh century ad) to the effect that the
star-worshippers of Harran, the Sabians (whose ‘holy books’ were
supposedly the writings of Thoth-Hermes) came at that time on special
pilgrimages to the Pyramids at Giza.*" It has also been pointed out that the
very name of the Sabians — in Arabic Sa'Ba — almost certainly derived
from the ancient Egyptian word for star, i.e. Sba}'^ And the reader will
recall from Part I that as far back as the early second millennium BC — i.e.
almost three thousand years before Yakut al Hamawi left us his report
connecting the Sabians to the Pyramids — pilgrims from Harran are known
to have visited the Sphinx which they worshipped as a god under the name Hwl}^
In the seventeenth century, the British mathematician Sir Isaac Newton
became deeply interested in the Great Pyramid and wrote a dissertation on
its mathematical and geodetic quahties based on data that had been
gathered at Giza by Dr John Greaves, the Savillian Professor of
Astronomy at Oxford.*^ Later, in 1865 the Astronomer Royal of Scotland,
Charles Piazzi Smyth, launched an investigation into the Great Pyramid
which he was convinced was an instrument of prophecy that incorporated
a Messianic message . It was Piazzi Smyth who first accurately measured
and demonstrated the intense polar and meridional alignments of the

monument, the precision of which he assigned to sightings of the ancient
Pole star, Alpha Draconis.'"*
In the first half of the twentieth century, a succession of eminent
astronomers - such as Richard Proctor, Eugene Antoniadi, Jean Baptiste
Biot and Norman Lockyer- made persistent attempts to draw attention to
the astronomical qualities ofthe Giza monuments. Their efforts, however,
had little impact on professional Egyptologists who by this time felt that
they had got the whole intellectual business ofthe necropohs ‘wrapped up’
(it was a cemetery), did not understand astronomy at all (and claimed that
the ancient Egyptians didn’t either), and routinely ganged up to debunk,
deride or simply ignore any astronomical ‘theories’ which diverged from
their consensus.
Despite this hostile intellectual climate, we are of the opinion at the end
of our own research that the big question is no longer whether the
monuments of Giza were designed to express key astronomical and
mathematical principles, but why.
Once again, the clue may he in the narrow star-shafts of the Great
Pyramid.
The language of the stars
The first major breakthrough in understanding the function of the Great
Pyramid’s shafts was made in the summer of 1963 by the American
astronomer Virginia Trimble and the Egyptologist-architect, Dr
Alexander Badawy. It came about because they decided to follow up
Badawy’s ‘hunch’ that the shafts might not be ‘ventilation channels’ as
Egyptologists supposed,’^ but might instead prove to have a symbolic
function related to the astral rituals of the Pyramid builders. Virginia
Trimble was able to buttress her colleague’s intuition by showing that the
shafts from the King’s Chamber had pointed, in the epoch of 2500 bc, to
major star systems that were of crucial importance to the Pyramid
builders. As readers will recall from Part I, the northern shaft had been
targeted on Alpha Draconis - the Pole Star in the Pyramid Age - and the
southern shaft had been targeted on Orion’s belt.'^
Today Virginia Trimble is a senior professor of astronomy at UCLA
and the University of Maryland and is also the Vice-President of the



244 Map
American Astronomical Society. Her views, as well as being enlightened
by a comprehensive grasp ofastronomy, accord fully with common sense:
Which constellations the Egyptians saw in the sky is still something of a
mystery . .. but they had one constellation that was an erect standing man,
Osiris, the god. And the one constellation that looks like a standing man to
everyone is Orion, and the identification between a deceased Pharaoh and the
god Osiris made Orion inrunediately a candidate for a shaft whose sole purpose
was to enable the soul of the Pharaoh to communicate between earth and sky. .
When we met Virginia Trimble we immediately realized we were in the
presence of an acute and formidable thinker. Alexander Badawy had
passed away in the late 1980s yet she remained undaunted. She had
concluded that the shafts were astronomically aligned, she said, and that
they had an astronomical function, because logic and evidence dictated
that this was the case.
Trimble’s views have won general acceptance amongst senior astrono¬
mers. To give one recent example. Dr Mary Bruck of Edinburgh, writing
in Journal ofthe British AstronomicalAssociation in 1995, had this to say
about the shafts: ‘Their alignments are. . . compatible with the hypothesis
that they indicate the culmination of certain important stars around the
25th century bc . . . The addition of a Sirius shaft [southern shaft of the
Queen’s Chamber] to the Orion one strongly supports the claim that they
have an astronomical significance.’ **
Thought-tools
We suggest that one of the major objectives ofthe unseen academy, whose
members were known as the ‘Followers ofHorus’, was to ‘fix’ the epoch of
2500 BC (i.e. 4500 years before the present) by using the Great Pyramid, its
precisely angled shafts, and the stars of Orion’s belt. We suggest that they
envisaged those stars rather like the gauge of a gigantic sliding scale set
across the south meridian. Once this ‘thought-tool’ was in place all they
needed to do in order to determine a date either in the past or in the future
was mentally to ‘slide’ the belt up or down the meridian from the ‘zero
point’ targeted by the southern shaft of the Kang’s Chamber.
We also suggest that a second and somewhat similar ‘thought-tool’ was
attached to the ecliptic (the apparent annual path of the sun through the



Message in a Bottle? 245
twelve constellations of the zodiac). Here the gauge was the vernal point.
By mentally sliding it to the left (east) or to the right (west) of a ‘fixed’
marker on the echptic the ‘Followers of Horus’ would once again have
been able to determine and denominate either a past date or a date in the
future. . .
In our own epoch, circa ad 2000, the vernal point is poised to enter the
sign or ‘Age’ of Aquarius. For a httle over 2000 years it has been passing
through Pisces (160 BC to ad 2000) and before that it was in Aries (2320 BC
to 160 Bc). In the Pyramid Age the vernal point slowly swept through
Taurus (4480 bc to 2320 bc). Going further back we reach the ‘Ages’ of
Gemini (6640 bc to 4480 bc) and then Cancer (8800 bc to 6640 bc). After
six ‘Great Months’ we reach the Age of Leo (10,960 bc to 8800 bc).
Now imagine that we find an ancient document at Giza which states that
it was composed when the vernal point was in the sign of the Ram — i.e.
when the sun on the spring equinox rose against the stellar background of
the constellation ofAries. Armed with this information all that we can do is
roughly bracket the document’s date as being somewhere between 2320 bc
and 160 BC. What we need in order to arrive at a more precise chronology is
some means to ‘fine-tune’ the vernal point. It is here that the specific utility
ofthe shding scale at the meridian becomes apparent because ifthe ancient
document not only stated which zodiacal sign housed the vernal point but
also advised that the lowest star of Orion’s belt crossed the meridian at an
altitude of 50 degrees above the horizon then we would be able, using
precession, to calculate with great accuracy that the date in question must
be very near 1400 BC.'’
The Pyramid Age occurred when the vernal point was in Taurus and, as
we have seen, the fine-tuning permitted by the 45-degree angle of the
Great Pyramid’s ‘Orion shaft’ draws particular attention to the date of
2500 BC. With this date, 4500 years before the present, we can use
precession to calculate the exact position ofthe vernal point - which, as the
reader will recall, was near the head of the Hyades-Taurus at that time,
close to the right (i.e. west) bank of the Milky Way.
The reader will also not have forgotten that this is the ‘address’ given in
the Pyramid Texts as the starting point for the cosmic journey of the solar
Horus-King. It is here that he receives his instructions to board the solar
bark and ‘sail’ across the Milky Way towards the ‘horizon’ to meet up with
Horakhti. His direction of travel is, therefore, eastwards, i.e. to the left of



246 Map
the vernal point. In terms of the chronology of the ‘Great Year’ of
precession (as distinct from the solar year), this means that the Horus
King is now poised to travel back in time towards the age ofLeo-Horakhti
and to a specific spot on the ecliptic path - ‘The Splendid Place of the
“First Time” ’. . . ‘the place more noble than any place’.^“
But where is that place.? How is the Horus-King (initiate, seeker) to find
it in the 2160-year, 30-degree swathe that the constellation of Leo
occupies on the ecliptic.?
The answer is that he would have to use the gauge ofOrion’s belt at the
meridian to fine-tune the exact place of the vernal point and hence also to
arrive at an exact date. In his mind’s eye he would have to slide the belt
‘down’ the meridian to its ‘First Time’ and then see how far to the east that
operation had ‘pushed’ the vernal point along the ecliptic.
Wherever that place was would be the celestial destination that the
‘Followers of Horus’ were urging him to reach.
And it would, of course, have its counterpart on the ground at Giza, in
the vicinity of the lion-bodied Sphinx.

Pyramid Texts
The epoch of the ‘First Time’, Zep Tepi^ was frequently referred to as the
‘First Time of Horns’, the ‘First Time of Re’ and the ‘First Time of
Osiris’.* The imphcation of this terminology is that the position of the
(vernal) sun along the ecliptic path, which denoted the ‘First Time’, was
also seen to be marked - perhaps ‘controlled’ would be a better word - by
the position of Osiris-Orion at the meridian.
As we have seen, the ancient brotherhood of astronomer-priests who
designed the Great Pyramid, and who were later responsible for the
compilation of the Pyramid Texts, were well aware of Orion’s slow
processional drift ‘upwards’ - ‘northwards’ in the allegorical language of
the texts - when the constellation was sighted at the meridian over long
periods of time. They also knew that they were ‘fixing’ a specific location
to which the ‘body of the god’ had drifted (and a specific date in time
2500 BC in our calendar) when they targeted the meridian at 45 degrees
with the southern shaft of the King’s Chamber. They knew, in other
words, that the belt stars would rise to higher altitudes above the horizon
(i.e. drift further ‘north’) in future epochs and, conversely, that they had
been at lower altitudes (i.e. ‘further south’) in previous epochs. The reader
will recall from Chapter i that the lowest (‘southernmost’) point in the
entire precessional cycle of Orion’s belt — the ‘First Time of Osiris’ in



248 Map
allegorical terms - occurred in 10,500 bc. Most mysteriously, it is the
precise disposition ofthese stars in the sky at that date that is frozen on the
ground in the form of the three great Pyramids of Giza.
It was the mystery ofthis perfect meridian-to-meridian match, together
with the equinoctial alignment of the hon-bodied Sphinx (and the vast
antiquity of that monument as indicated by geology) that provoked us to
undertake the present investigation. For while we did not dispute the
orthodox Egyptological dating ofthe Pyramids to the epoch of2500 bc, we
had a strong intuition that their layout in the image of Orion’s belt some
8000 years earlier was most unlikely to have come about by chance.
We are now satisfied that chance was not involved. After factoring-in
the data preserved in the vast storehouses of ancient Egyptian funerary
‘software’, it seems to us obvious that what was created — or rather
completed - at Giza in 2500 BC was an entirely deliberate work of
sky-ground dualism. It was a model (on a lavish scale intended to do
justice to its cosmic original) of the ‘kingdom’ established by Osiris in the
sky-Duat in the remote epoch ‘when his name became Orion’ - i.e. in his
‘First Time’. It was also, for all time, the ‘Kingdom of Osiris’ on the
ground - ‘when his name became Sokar’ (in the lower Duat, i.e. the
Memphite necropolis).
It may have been the case that the ground-plan of the three great
Pyramids was physically established in 10,500 BC - perhaps in the form of
low platforms. Or it may have been that precise astronomical records from
that epoch were preserved and handed down to the astronomer-priests of
Heliopolis by the ‘Followers ofHorns’. Either way, we are still reasonably
certain that the Pyramids themselves were largely built in 2500 bc when
Egyptologists say they were. We are also sure, however, that the site was
already vastly ancient by then and had been the domain of the ‘Followers’
- the Sages, the ‘Senior Ones’ - for the previous 8000 years.
We think the evidence suggests a continuous transmission of advanced
scientific and engineering knowledge over that huge gulf of time, and thus
the continuous presence in Egypt, from the Palaeolithic into the Dynastic
Period, of highly enlightened and sophisticated individuals — those
shadowy Akhus said in the texts to have possessed ‘a knowledge of divine
origin’.



The Place of the ‘First Time’ 249
Fine-tuning Leo
The basis for this conjecture, above and beyond the astronomical
alignments of the Giza necropolis, is the geological condition of the
Sphinx which we have described in Part I. To state matters briefly: the
signs ofintense precipation-induced weathering visible to this day on the great
monument itself and on the rock-hewn trench surrounding it, are consistent
with an age ofmore than 12,000 years.
The genesis date indicated by astronomy for the site as a whole is 10,500
BC. That is what the layout of the Pyramids says, even if they themselves
are younger. And that, too, as we saw in Chapter 3, is what is proclaimed
by the due-east orientation of the Sphinx. Its astronomical and leonine
symbohsm does not make any sense unless it was built as an equinoctial
marker for the Age of Leo.
But when, exactly, in the Age of Leo.? The constellation spans 30
degrees along the ecliptic and housed the sun on the vernal equinox from
10,960 BC to 8800 BC - a period of 2160 years. So when in that period.?
There is no way to answer this question on the basis ofthe alignments of
the Sphinx alone, or on the basis of what one may deduce from its
alignments and its geology viewed together. What is needed is precisely
what the ‘Followers of Homs’ provided us with - a thought-tool with
which to fine-tune the date. That thought-tool is the sliding scale of
Orion’s belt and the date that it fine-tunes for the Great Sphinx is 10,500
BC.
But it also does something else. As the scale ‘slides’ down the meridian it
also ‘pushes’ the vernal point steadily eastwards along the ecliptic,
bringing it to rest in 10,500 BC (the ‘bottom of the scale’) at a specific stellar
address that can be identified by precessional calculations.
In terms ofthe sky-ground dualism of the initiatory quest ofthe Horus
King, it is obvious that the vernal point’s ‘stellar address’ in 10,500 BC- i.e.
its precise whereabouts on the ecliptic within the constellation of Leo - is
likely to have a terrestrial analogue. Once we know what’s what with the
sky, in other words, we should know where to look on the ground.
And would it be entirely unreasonable to suppose that what we would
find there, ifwe had calculated exactly where to look, might turn out to be a
physical entrance into that mythical ‘place more noble than any place’, the
‘Splendid Place of the “First Time” ’.?

Setting stars
As though to reward such conjectures, like a one-armed bandit coughing
up the jackpot, all the bells and lights of the Giza necropolis start ringing
and flashing at once when the sliding scale of Orion’s belt is pushed down
to its ‘First Time’ in 10,500 BC.
We already know from Chapter 3 that what the principal monuments
seem to model is an unusual astronomical conjunction that occurred at the
spring equinox in that distant epoch. Not only did the Great Sphinx gaze
at his own celestial counterpart in the sky but also the moment of sunrise
(at the point on the horizon targeted by the Sphinx’s gaze) coincided, to
the second, with the meridian-transit of Orion’s belt (which is what the
three Pyramids model).
If these were the only correspondences they would already be too
detailed to be attributed to coincidence. But there is a great deal more. For
example, immediately south of the third and smallest of the three great
Pyramids is a group of three ‘satellite’ pyramids. Egyptologists generally
refer to them as the ‘tombs’ of queens of the Pharaoh Menkaure. Since
they contain no inscriptions, nor the slightest trace of human remains or
funerary equipment, such an attribution can never be anything more than
a matter of opinion. However these ‘satellite’ pyramids do have an
unambiguous astronomical alignment: they form a row running east-west
- the equinox sunrise-sunset direction.
The British geometrician and pyramid researcher, Robin Cook, has
recently shown that these three satellite pyramids bear a designed
relationship to the Giza necropolis as a whole.^ They appear to be located
on the boundary of a circle, or artificial ‘horizon’, the focus of which is the
Pyramid of Khafre and the circumference of which envelops the whole
necropolis. An angle of 27 degrees west of south^ - corresponding to an
azimuth of 207 degrees^ - seems to be defined by a straight line extending
from the meridian axis of the Pyramid of Khafre to these three ‘satellite’
pyramids of Menkaure. In general the satellites give the impression of
being ‘reduced models’ of the three Great Pyramids. What is notably
different however, is that the latter lie at an angle of 45 degrees to the
meridian, while the former run from east to west at right-angles to the
meridian. This apparent architectural anomaly, together with their
curious location at azimuth 207 degrees on the artificial ‘horizon’ of Giza,

begs an obvious question: are we again looking at datable sky event frozen
in architecture?
The computer confirms that we are. In 10,500 BC, on the real horizon of
Giza, the lowest of the three stars of Orion’s belt, Al Nitak, set at 27
degrees west of south - i.e, at azimuth 207 degrees. Moreover, the belt
stars at that moment would have formed an axis running east-west — the
alignment that is mimicked by the three satellite pyramids.
Sirius
Another bit of the 10,500 BC ‘jackpot of correspondences’ concerns the
star Sirius, which symbolizes the very heart of the ancient Egyptian
mystery.
All stars, including our own sun (and our solar system with it) move
through space. Because ofthe vast distances involved, however (hundreds
and often thousands of light-years), this ‘proper motion’ registers barely
perceptible effects on the positions in the sky of the majority of stars as
viewed from earth. Where these stars are concerned the only significant
factor is precession (which, as we know, is a perceived ‘motion’ that is
actually caused by a wobble on the axis of the earth).
Sirius is one ofthe major exceptions to this rule. As many readers will be
aware, it is the brightest star in the sky. It is also one of the nearest stars to
earth, being only 8.4 light-years away. Because of this proximity it
registers a very large proper motion’ in space relative to our own solar
system — large enough to bring about observable changes in its celestial
address, over and above those caused by precession^ within just a few
thousand years.
To be specific about this, the proper motion of Sirius is estimated to be
in the range of i .21 arc-seconds per year (about i degree every 3000 years).
This means that for an epoch as far back as 10,500 bc, the change in its
celestial co-ordinates resulting from proper motion could exceed 3 full
degrees of arc, i.e about six times the apparent diameter of the moon.*^
Once this rapid and noticeable rate of movement is taken into account
alongside the effects of precession, computer simulations indicate a rather
intriguing state of affairs. Calculations show that when Sirius reached its
First Time — i.e. its lowest altitude above the horizon — viewers at the
latitude of Giza (30 degrees north) would have seen it resting exactly on

254 Map
the horizon. Moreover it was from this latitude, and this latitude only^ that
such a conjunction of star and horizon could be witnessed. The
implication is that a special co-relationship exists between the latitude of
Giza and the star Sirius at its ‘First Time’.’
Because of its large proper motion there is uncertainty over when
exactly the ‘First Time’ of Sirius would have occurred. There is no doubt,
however, that it would have been somewhere between 11,500 and 10,500
BC.* We wonder, therefore, whether the decision to establish the sacred site
of Giza at 30 degrees north latitude could have been connected to this
‘First Time’ of Sirius.? And we recall that in 1993 Rudolf Gantenbrink’s
robot camera discovered a mysterious ‘door’ inside the Great Pyramid,
more than 200 feet along the narrow southern shaft of the Queen’s
Chamber.’ The shaft in which the ‘door’ was found was, of course,
targeted on the meridian-transit of Sirius in 2500 BC.
Cross-quarter causeways
Amongst the strangest and most unaccountable features of the Giza
necropohs are the massive causeways that Unk each of the three great
Pyramids with the Nile Valley below. Today only fragments of their
floorings remain, but as late as the fifth century BC at least one causeway,
that of the Great Pyramid, was still almost intact. We know this because it
was seen and described by the Greek historian Herodotus (484-420 bc)
who reflected that its construction almost matched, in engineering
prowess and architectural splendour, that of the Great Pyramid itself.*®
Recent archaeological research has confirmed that the information
provided by Herodotus is correct. Moreover, we now know that the roofs
ofthe causeways were spangled on their undersides with patterns ofstars"
- highly appropriate symbolism if, as we believe is the case, these grand
and curious corridors were designed to serve as Viae Sacrae - ceremonial
‘roadways’ which initiates would follow on their way to the ‘Pyramid
stars’ of Rostau-Giza.*’
The causeway from the Third Pyramid (the Pyramid of Menkaure) is
directed due-east, hke the gaze of the Sphinx, and thus conforms to the
general north-south and east-west grid structure of the Giza necropolis.
By contrast the two causeways linked to the other two Pyramids definitely
do not conform to that grid structure. As a result of the work of



The Place of the ‘First Time’ 255
geometrician John Legon, who has undertaken a detailed analysis of the
site-plans and grids provided by modem Egyptologists (such as Selim
Hassan, Reisner, Holscher, Ricke and Lauer), we now know that this
anomalous nonconformity nevertheless incorporates its own strict sym¬
metry: ‘while the causeway of the Third Pyramid is aligned due east-west,
the causeways ofthe Second and Great Pyramids both have a bearing of 14
degrees - the former to the south and the latter to the north of due east.’’"*
61. The course ofthe sun throughout the year as viewed from the latitude of Giza. A full range
of 56 degrees is defined between summer solstice at 28 degrees north ofeast and winter solstice
at 28 degrees south of east (with the equinox, of course, at due east). The ‘cross-quarter’
sunrises therefore occur at 14 degrees north of east and 14 degrees south of east respectively,
thus dividing the sun’s range along the horizon into four equal parts.

63. The Menkaure causeway runs due east in perfect alignment with sunrise on the spring
equinox and on the autumn equinox.



258 Map



The Place of the ‘First Time’ 259
Legon has also provided conclusive evidence that the design of the
Khufu and Khafre causeways is in fact integrated with the geometry ofthe
Giza complex as a whole - and not merely with that of the individual
Pyramids themselves. Furthermore, far from being conditioned by the
topography of the site (as had previously been supposed) the direction of
these causeways (14 degrees north and south of east respectively) shows
every sign of being part of a ‘unified plan’ whose ‘hidden purpose’ and
impetus ‘possibly resided with the priests of Heliopolis’.'^
But what ‘hidden purpose’ could dictate the decision to direct one
causeway due east, another 14 degrees south of due east, and a third 14
degrees north of due east.^
When sunrise is observed conscientiously throughout the course of the
year from the latitude of Giza, the answer to this question becomes
obvious. Here, as everywhere else on the planet, the sun rises due east - in
line with the Menkaure causeway (and the gaze of the Sphinx) - on the
spring equinox. What is unique about the latitude of Giza, as we have
noted several times previously, is that on the summer solstice (the longest
day of the year) the sun rises 28 degrees to the north of due east whilst on
the winter solstice (the shortest day) it rises 28 degrees to the south of due
east. This gives a full variation of 56 degrees and it is a simple matter offact
that what astronomers refer to as the ‘cross-quarters’ of this variation, i.e
the sunrise-points located exactly half way between each equinox and
solstice, are at 14 degrees north ofdue east and 14 degrees south ofdue east
respectively. In short the three causeways signal and bracket the equinox
with two gigantic ‘arrows’ pointed at the cross-quarter sunrises and a third
arrow (the Menkaure causeway) pointed at the equinox sunrise itself. In
this fashion the sun’s range throughout the year along the eastern horizon
is architecturally divided into four equal segments each with a range of 14
degrees - i.e. into its astronomical ‘cross-quarters’.
Now a focus on the cross-quarter days, together with the equinoxes and
solstices, is an extremely well-documented phenomenon amongst many
ancient astronomically minded peoples (dictating the alignment of their
temples and the dates of their most important festivals).'^ It is therefore
not surprising to find such a focus expressed in the architecture ofthe Giza
necropolis. Neither should we be surprised by the accuracy with which the
causeways define the cross-quarters since all the other alignments of the
necropolis were achieved with equally high precision.

shoulders protruding into view above ground level. Once again the images in the sky and on the ground ‘lock’ at 10,500 BC.
There is one feature ofthe layout, however, that is truly exceptional and
remarkable.
Computer reconstructions of the ancient skies reveal that if we could
travel back in time to the cross-quarter day that fell between the winter
solstice and the vernal equinox in 10,500 bc, and position ourselves at the
‘top’, i.e. the western end, of the Khafre causeway gazing along it towards
the edge of the ‘Horizon’ of Giza, then we would witness the following celestial events at dawn:
1 The sun would rise at 14 degrees south of east in direct alignment
with the causeway;*^
2 Immediately to the left of this point would be the great constellation
of Leo-Horakhti, with only its massive head and shoulders
protruding above the horizon line {it would, in other words, appear to
be partially sunk, or 'buried'in the 'Horizon ofthe Sky').
Now let us look down from the sky to the ground. Following the south¬
easterly direction of the causeway from the same viewpoint we note that it
sinks down with the general slope ofthe Giza plateau and passes just to the
south of the southern edge of the Sphinx enclosure. The Sphinx itself
Hor-em-Akhet - stands partially sunk, or 'buried' in that enclosure (and
thus in the ‘Horizon of Giza’) with only its massive head and shoulders
protruding out of the groundline.
Once again the images of sky and ground match perfectly at 10,500 bc and in no other epoch . . .
Treasure map
We said earlier that in the architectural-astronomical system of the
Pyramid builders the position of the vernal point along the ecliptic which



The Place of the ‘First Time’ 263
denoted the ‘Splendid Place of the “First Time” ’ was considered to be
‘controlled’ by the position of Osiris-Orion at the meridian: ‘slide’ Orion’s
belt up from its location at 2500 bc and the vernal point is ‘pushed’
westwards around the ecliptic (and forward in time) in the direction
Taurus —> Aries —> Pisces —> Aquarius; ‘slide’ it down and the vernal point
is pushed ‘east’, i.e. back in time, in the direction Taurus —> Gemini —>
Cancer —> Leo. So in 10,500 BC, with the belt stars fully ‘sUd down’ to their
lowest possible altitude above the horizon, how far around the ecliptic has
the vernal point been ‘pushed.? We know it is in Leo. But where in Leo.?
Computer simulations show that it lay exactly 11 i.i 11 degrees east of
the station that it had occupied at 2500 bc. Then it had been at the head of
the Hyades-Taurus close to the right bank of the Milky Way; 8000 years
earlier it lay directly under the rear paws ofthe constellation ofLeo.
As we have hinted, this is a location that is likely to have a terrestrial
‘double’. The three stars of Orion’s belt have their terrestrial doubles in
the form of the three Great Pyramids. The constellation of Leo-Horakhti
has its terrestrial double in the form of Hor-em-Akhet, i.e. the Great
Sphinx. The ‘Horizon of the Sky’ has its terrestrial double in the form of
the ‘Horizon of Giza’. And the Great Sphinx crouches literally within this
‘Horizon’.
It was to the breast of the Great Sphinx, at the summer solstice in the
Pyramid Age, that the quest ofthe Horus-King led. There he encountered
the Akhus:
‘How has this happened to you’, say they, the Akhus with their mouths
equipped, ‘that you have come to this place more noble than any place.?’
‘I have come. . . because the reed floats ofthe sky were set down for Re [the
sun-disc and cosmic ‘double’ of the Horus-King] that Re might cross [the
Milky Way] on them to Horakhti at the Horizon’. .
In other words, the Horus-King has successfully understood and used the
clues provided in the ritual. He has noted and followed the path ofthe sun
during the solar year from its starting point - designated in the texts as
being beside the Hyades-Taurus, i.e. the ‘Bull of the Sky’ - and thence
across the Milky Way until the moment of its conjunction with Regulus,
the heart-star of Leo. He has then taken this celestial treasure map,
transposed its co-ordinates to the ground, made his way across the River
Nile and ascended to the Giza plateau, coming eventually to the breast of
the Sphinx.



264 Map
We think that he received there the necessary clues or instructions to
find the entrance to the terrestrial Duat^ to the ‘Kingdom of Osiris’ on the
ground - in short to the ‘Splendid Place of the “First Time” ’ where fie
would have to go in order to complete his quest. And we suggest that these
clues were designed to encourage him to track the vernal point, just as we
have done, to the location that it would have occupied in 10,500 bc when
Orion’s belt had reached the lowest point in its processional cycle.
In other words it is our hypothesis that the Giza monuments, the past,
present and future skies that lie above them, and the ancient funerary texts
that interlink them, convey the lineaments of a message. In attempting to
read this message we have done no more than follow the initiation
‘journey’ ofthe Horus-Kings of Egypt. And hke the ancient Horus-Kings
we, too, have arrived at a most intriguing crossroad. The trail ofinitiation
has guided us, directed us and finally lured us to stand in front ofthe Great
Sphinx and, like Oedipus, to confront the ultimate riddles: ‘Where did we
come from.?’ ‘Where are we to go to?’
The gaze of the Sphinx urges us to see through the shadowy veil and
seek the ‘First Time’. But, having done that, it also provokes us to ask
whether there might not in fact be something at Giza, something physical,
that would give form to the site’s strange aura of vast and exceptional
antiquity.
We remember a passage from the Coffin Texts which invites us to
consider the possibility that some great ‘secret’ of Osiris may remain
hidden within or beneath the monuments of Rostau-Giza in a ‘sealed’
container: ‘This is the sealed thing, which is in darkness, with fire about it,
which contains the efflux of Osiris, and it is put in Rostau. It has been
hidden since it fell from him, and it is what came down from him onto the
desert of sand; it means that what belonged to him was put in Rostau . .
What can it be that was put in Rostau?
What hidden thing with fire about it?
And where in darkness does it lie?
Ifwe look at our computer simulation ofthe skies over Giza in 10,500 BC
the answer appears to be staring us in the face. In that year, in the pre¬
dawn on the spring equinox, the constellation of Leo could be seen rising
slowly in the east. By around 5 a.m. it was fully risen, exactly straddling
due east - a lion in the sky, with its belly resting on the horizon. At the
same moment, the sun — marking the vernal point - lay some 12 degrees

68. The Horus-King’s treasure map: the heliacal rising ofLeo on the spring equinox in 10,500

constellation’s rear paws. When this image is transposed to the ground, the logic ofthe Horus
King’s quest suggests the possibility of a hidden chamber deep in the bedrock of the Giza
plateau, approximately 100 feet beneath the rear paws of the Sphinx.
beneath its rear paws.
When we translate this sky-image onto the ground, in the form of a
colossal, leonine, equinoctial monument with its belly resting on the
bedrock of the real physical environment of the ‘Horizon of Giza’, we do
indeed find ourselves looking at the Horus-King’s treasure map. It is a
map, not buried in the earth but cunningly concealed in time, where ‘X’

almost literally ‘marks a spot’ directly under the rear paws of the Great
Sphinx of Egypt at a depth, we would guess, of about 100 feet.
Ifwe have read the message ofthe ‘Followers ofHorus’ right, then there
is something of momentous importance there, waiting to be found - by
seismic surveys, by drilling and excavations, in short by a rediscovery and
exploration of the hidden corridors and chambers ofthe earthly ‘Kingdom
of Osiris’.
It could be the ultimate prize.

The dictionary tells us that, separately from its modem usage, the word
‘glamour’ has a traditional meaning roughly equivalent to ‘magic spell’ or

Is it possible that men and women of great wisdom and learning cast a

view? For thousands of years, in other words, has the ancient Egyptian
royal cemetary at Giza veiled the presence of something else - something
of vastly greater significance for the story of Mankind?
One thing we are sure ofis that unlike the hundreds ofFourth-Dynasty
mastaba tombs to the west of the Sphinx and clustered around the three
great Pyramids, the Pyramids themselves were never designed to serve
primarily as burial places. We do not rule out the possibility that the
Pharaohs Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure may at one time have been buried
within them — although there is no evidence for this — but we are now
satisfied that the transcendent effort and skill that went into the
construction of these awe-inspiring monuments was motivated by a
higher purpose.
We think that purpose was connected to the quest for eternal life
wrapped up in a complete religious and spiritual system that the ancient
Egyptians inherited from unknown predecessors and that they later
codified in their eerie and other-worldly funerary and rebirth texts. We
suggest, in short, that it was the goal of immortality, not just for one
Pharaoh but for many, that the corridors and passages and hidden
chambers and concealed gates and doorways of the Giza complex were
ultimately designed to serve. Depicted in the Book ofWhat is in the Duat as
being filled with monsters, these narrow, claustrophobic, terrifying places,
hemmed in on all sides by sheer stone walls, were in our view conceived as
the ultimate testing ground for initiates. Here they would be forced to face
and overcome their most horrible and debilitating fears. Here they would
pass through unimaginable ordeals of the spirit and the mind. Here they
would learn esoteric wisdom through acts ofconcentrated intelligence and
will. Here they would be prepared, through practice and experience, for
the moment of physical death and for the nightmares that would follow it,
so that these transitions would not confuse or paralyse them - as they
might other, unprepared, souls - and so that they might become ‘equipped
spirits’ able to move as they wished through heaven and earth,
‘unfailingly, and regularly and eternally’.'
Such was the lofty goal of the Horus-King’s quest and the ancient
Egyptians clearly believed that in order to attain it the initiate would have
to participate in the discovery, the unveiling, the revelation, of something



270 Map
of momentous importance - something that would bestow wisdom, and
knowledge of the ‘First Time’, and of the mysteries of the cosmos, and of
Osiris, the Once and Future King.
We are therefore reminded of a Hermetic Text, written in Greek but
compiled in Alexandria in Egypt some 2000 years ago, that is known as the
Kore Kosmu (or Virgin ofthe World)} Like other such writings, this text
speaks of Thoth, the ancient Egyptian wisdom-god, but refers to him by
his Greek name, Hermes:
Such was all-knowing Hermes, who saw all things, and seeing understood, and
understanding had the power both to disclose and to give explanation. For
what he knew, he graved on stone; yet though he graved them onto stone he
hid them mostly . . . The sacred symbols of the cosmic elements [he] hid away
hard by the secrets ofOsiris. . . keeping sure silence, that every younger age of
cosmic time might seek for them.^
The text then tells us that before he ‘returned to Heaven’ Hermes invoked
a spell on the secret writings and loiowledge that he had hidden:
O holy books, who have been made by my immortal hands, by incorruption’s
magic spells . . . free from decay throughout eternity remain, and incorrupt
from time. Become unseeable, unfindable, for every one whose foot shall tread
the plains ofthis land, until Old Heaven doth bring forth meet instruments for you . .
What instruments might lead to the recovery of ‘unseeable and
unfindable’ secrets concealed at Giza.^
Our research has persuaded us that a scientific language of processional
time and allegorical astronomy was deliberately expressed in the principal
monuments there and in the texts that relate to them. From quite an early
stage in our investigation, we hoped that this language might shed new
light on the enigmatic civilization of Egypt. We did not at first suspect,
however, that it would also turn out to encode specific celestial co-‘
ordinates or that these would transpose onto the ground in the form of an
arcane ‘treasure map’, directing the attention of seekers to a precise
location in the bedrock deep beneath the Sphinx.
Nor did we suspect, until we met them, that others such as the Edgar
Cayce Foundation and the Stanford Research Institute - see Part II
might already be looking there.

Osiris breathes
Throughout this investigation we have tried to stick to the facts, even
when the facts have been very strange.
When we say that the Sphinx, the three Great Pyramids, the causeways
and other associated monuments of the Giza necropolis form a huge
astronomical diagram we are simply reporting a fact. When we say that
this diagram depicts the skies above Giza in 10,500 bc we are reporting a
fact. When we say that the Sphinx bears erosion marks which indicate that
it was carved before the Sahara became a desert we are reporting a fact.
When we say that the ancient Egyptians attributed their civilization to ‘the
gods’ and to the ‘Followers ofHorus’ we are reporting facts. When we say
that these divine and human civilizers were remembered as having come to
the Nile Valley in Zep Tepi — the ‘First Time’ - we are reporting a fact.
When we say that the ancient Egyptian records tell us this ‘First Time’ was
an epoch in the remote past, thousands of years before the era of the
Pharaohs, we are reporting a fact.
Our civihzation has had the scientific wherewithal to get to grips with
the many problems of the Giza necropolis for less than two centuries, and
it is only in the last two decades that computer technology has made it
possible for us to reconstruct the ancient skies and see the patterns and
conjunctions that unfolded there. During this period access to the site, and
knowledge about it, has been monopolized by members ofthe archaeologi¬
cal and Egyptological professions who have agreed amongst themselves as
to the origin, and age, and function of the monuments. New evidence
which does not support this scholarly consensus, and which might actively
undermine it, has again and again been overlooked, or sidelined, and
sometimes even deliberately concealed from the public. This, we assume,
is why everything to do with the shafts ofthe Great Pyramid - their stellar
alignments, the iron plate, the relics, and the discovery of the ‘door’ - has
met with such peculiar and inappropriate responses from Egyptologists
and archaeologists. And we assume that it explains, too, why the same
scholars have paid such scant attention to the solid case that geologists
have made for the vast antiquity of the Sphinx.’
The Giza monuments are a legacy for Mankind, preserved almost intact
over thousands of years, and, outside the privileged circles of Egyptology
and archaeology, there is today a broad-based expectation that they might
be about to reveal a remarkable secret. That expectation may or may not



272 Map
prove to be correct. Nevertheless in an intellectual culture polarized by
public anticipation and orthodox reaction, we feel it is only wise that
future explorations at the necropolis should be conducted with complete
‘transparency’ and accountability. In particular the opening of the ‘door’
inside the southern shaft of the Queen’s Chamber, the videoscopic
examination of the northern shaft, and any further remote-sensing and
drilling surveys conducted around the Sphinx, should be carried out
under the scrutiny ofthe international mass media and should not again be
subjected to bizarre and inexplicable delays.
We cannot predict what new discoveries will be made by such research,
or even whether any new discoveries will be made. However, after
completing our own archaeoastronomical investigation, and following the
quest of the Horus-King, we are left with an enhanced sense of the
tremendous mystery of this amazing site - a sense that its true story has
only just begun to be told. Looking at the awe-inspiring scale and
precision of the monuments we feel, too, that the purpose of the ancient
master-builders was subhme, and that they did indeed find a way to
initiate those who would come after - thousands ofyears in the future—by
making use of the universal language of the stars.
They found a way to send a message across the ages in a code so simple
and so self-explanatory that it might rightly be described as an anti-cipher.
Perhaps the time has come to listen to that clear, compelling signal that
beckons to us out ofthe darkness ofprehistory. Perhaps the time has come
to seek the buried treasure of our forgotten genesis and destiny:
Stars fade like memory the instant before dawn. Low in the east the sun
appears, golden as an opening eye. That which can be named must exist. That
which is named can be written. That which is written shall be remembered.
That which is remembered lives. In the land of Egypt Osiris breathes . .

‘We three kings of Orion are;
Bearing gifts we traverse afar;
Field and fountain,
Moor and mountain,
Following yonder star.
Oh! Star of wonder, Star of might.
Star with royal beauty bright!
Westward leading.
Still proceeding.
Guide us to thy perfect light.
HE is the King of Glory.’
In her thesis on the astronomical content of ancient Egyptian funerary
texts, Jane B. Sellers observes that Spell 17 of the Book ofthe Dead^ which
is drawn from extremely ancient sources, alludes in cosmic terms to the
‘unification’ or joining of the ‘Two Lands’:’ ‘Horns, son of Osiris and Isis
. . . was made ruler in the place of his father, Osiris, on that day the Two
Lands were united. It means the union of the Two Lands at the burial of
Osiris . . ^
Following this statement. Spell 17 also makes specific reference to the
‘sun-god’ and how he was not obstructed by the celestial river but rather
‘passed on, having bathed in the Winding Waterway’.^
Sellers notes the conclusion of Yale astronomer-Egyptologist Virginia
Lee Davis that the ‘Winding Waterway’ of the Pyramid Texts is to be
equated with the Milky Way and that this feature of the sky ‘divides’ the
cosmic landscape into two halves.'’ She then adds: ‘I have contended that
the joining of the two lands is a joining of sky to earth.’ ^
In fact, both Sellers and Davis arrive at the same conclusion, namely
that the ‘divider’ of the celestial landscape is the Milky Way, and that
which crosses it from one side to the other is the sun. Sellers also observes



274 Appendix 1
that the point of ‘crossing’ of the ecliptic path is near ihe V-shaped
Hyades-Taurus constellation.^
If we seek to be precise about these matters we will discover that the
point of crossing is in fact a little further east along the ecliptic path,
marking a spot on the western shore of the Milky Way where today is
found the Mi nebula, also known as the Crab Nebula.’
Sellers, oddly, does not pursue the logical sequence of events in Spell
17, namely that the sun continues along its journey, reaches the ‘other side’
(i.e. the eastern side) of the Milky Way, and thence heads towards the
constellation of Leo. Indeed, Spell 17 bids the solar ‘Homs’, i.e. the sun
disc, to ‘run, mn to this’ location: ‘How well built is your House, O Atum,
how well founded is your mansion, O Double Lion . . .’
Atum or Atum-Re, as was shown in The Orion Aiystery, was originally
venerated as a ‘pillar’ in Heliopolis which, as many researchers have
concluded, was also seen as his ‘phallus’.* A somewhat similar ‘pillar’, the
so-called Djed pillar, was also associated with Osiris.’ Bearing this in
mind. Spell 17 makes a most telling statement: ‘As for the Lion whose
mouth is bright and whose head is shining, he is the Phallus of Osiris.
Otherwise said, he is the Phallus of Re . . .’ *“
Earlier in Spell 17 we are specifically informed that Atum is:
... in his sun-disc. Otherwise said he is Re when he rises in the eastern
horizon of the sky.
To me belongs yesterday, I know tomorrow.
What does it mean.^ As for yesterday, that is Osiris. As for tomorrow, that is
Re in which the foes of the Lord OfAll were destroyed and Horus was made to
rule. Otherwise said: That is the day of the ‘We remain’ festival, when the
burial of Osiris was ordered by his father Re.
The Battle-Ground ofthe gods was made in accordance with my command.
What does it mean? It is the West. It was made for the souls of the gods in
accordance with the command of Osiris, Lord of the Western Desert.
Otherwise said. It means that this is the West, to which Re made every god
descend and he fought for the Two [Lands] for it.
I know that Great God who is in it.
Who is he? It is Osiris . . ."
From this text we can see that a special ‘land of the gods’ was envisaged as
having been established in the Western Desert at the time of the burial of
Osiris — that is in the far-offepoch ofthe First Time. This was also the day

276 Appendix 1
on which Homs united the Two Lands and inherited this ‘battle ground’
or ‘land of the gods’.
We have seen in earlier chapters how the Memphite Theology in the
Shabaka Texts nominates the area in which these ‘unification’ events took
place as Ayan near Memphis.’^ Oddly, the process of‘the Unification of
the Two Lands’ is also referred to in these same sources as ‘the Balance of
the Two Lands, in which Upper and Lower Egypt have been weigh¬
ed...’*^
In the present work we have brought forward additional evidence in
support of Sellers’s contention that the ‘Two Lands’ in question were
indeed ‘sky’ and ‘earth’ and we have also shown that very specific parts of
the sky and earth were meant - i.e. the ‘Orion-Leo-Taurus’ sky-region
and the ‘Giza-Heliopolis-Memphis’ earth-region.
But how could these two sky-to-earth regions be ‘balanced’ and
‘weighed’.?
A state of perfect order
The point of‘balance’ is defined on the ground as: ‘. . . Ayan, that was the
division of the Two Lands ... in the name of the “White Wall”
[Memphis]. .
We have seen how this terrestrial location corresponds to a point in the
sky along the ecliptic path marking the spot on the western shore of the
Milky Way where the Mi Crab Nebula is located.
A closer look at the Memphite Theology, however, reveals that while
Ayan is envisaged as the pivot or ‘balance point’ of the Two Lands, the
actual process of‘weighing’ is described as taking place somewhere else
specifically in ‘the land ... [of the] burial of Osiris in the House of Sokar . . .’ ’^
Since we have already demonstrated that ‘the land of the House of
Sokar’ was Rostau, i.e. the Giza necropolis, we can conclude - by a simple
transposition of sky-ground terminology - that the ‘weighing’ or
balancing of the land was somehow done at Giza, and most likely beside
or within the Great Pyramid, the original ‘House’ of Sokar-Osiris.‘^
But why should the Great Pyramid have been seen as an ‘instrument’ by
which the ‘Two Lands’ - sky and ground - could be ‘balanced’ at a specific
spot, i.e. at Ayan-Memphis?

solar disc at the meridian.



278 Appendix 1
We must remind ourselves that the chronology and context of the
‘unification’ events was set way back in the cosmic landscape of the ‘First
Time’. Let us, therefore, transfer the imagery that now confronts us back
to the epoch 10,500 BC, and see how the supposed ‘perfect balance’ was
achieved at the cosmic ‘Ayan’, i.e. at the location, marked by the Mi Crab
Nebula that we have already identified on the ecliptic path.
The three great Pyramids of Giza, ofcourse, become Orion’s belt at the
meridian — with the Great Pyramid itself being represented by its specific
celestial counterpart, Al Nitak, the lowest of the three belt stars.
The diagram reproduced on page 283 shows Orion’s belt with Al Nitak
at the meridian in 10,500 BC. At this precise moment, as we saw in Chapter
17, the vernal-equinox point lay due east, just below Leo. Meanwhile the
‘opposed’ autumnal equinox point lay precisely due west (just below
Aquarius). In short, this was a time when the ‘Two Skies’ - one on each
side of the Milky Way — were in perfect balance, perfectly divided, just as
the texts describe.
Much suggests that the ‘Followers ofHoms’ envisaged the ecliptic path
of the sun arching like the huge beam of a scale across the visible sky. One
end of this beam was marked by Leo at the vernal-equinox point, and the
other by Aquarius at the autumnal-equinox point. So, when Al Nitak
came to rest at the celestial meridian on the vernal equinox in 10,500 BC the
sky could rightly be said to have been in a state of perfect order.
Maat
Cosmic Order, in the symbohc terminology of the ancient Egyptians, was
known as Maat. The same word also means ‘justice’ and ‘law’ - for
example the justice that was exercised by the ‘council of gods’ of
Heliopolis when they judged in favour of Horus, after his conflict with
Seth, and passed on to him the legacy of the Osirian throne.
The ancient Egyptian religious texts transmit details of one of the high
rituals of the Osirian liturgy - the ‘weighing of the soul’ of the dead in the
Great Judgement Hall of Osiris. This is a sort ofarchetypal ‘Judgement of
Solomon’, with the weighing being done on the Great Scales of Maat.
The Papyrus of Ani in the British Museum provides us with a
particularly vivid depiction of the Great Judgement Hall, and also of the
Great Scales of Maat. These latter have a name - Mekhaat — which



The Scales of the World 279
72. The Scales ofMaat. (Source; British Museum papyrus 9901-3).
means in other contexts ‘the balance of the Earth’.**
The hieroglyphic determinative sign for the verb ‘to weigh’ shows a
triangle, or builder’s ‘square’, with a plumb-bob suspended from the
apex*’ - a sign which can also mean to ‘balance the earth’.“ The triangle
distinctly recalls the profile or cross-section of a pyramid.
As we have seen in Part II of this book, a curious stone sphere, a length
ofwooden rod, and a bronze hook were found inside the Great Pyramid in
1872, sealed since the time of the construction of the monument in the
shafts of the Queen’s Chamber. Mr Henry Williams Chisholm, the Head
of the Standards Department of the Board of Trade in London, carefully
examined these relics in the year of their discovery and concluded that the
sphere was most probably a standard weight and that the rod and hook
might also have had functions connected with weighing and measuring.
He published these conclusions in the prestigious journal. Nature, on 26
December 1872.
Similar views were held by the Astronomer Royal of Scotland, Charles
Piazzi Smyth, who also examined the relics in 1872.^*



28o Appendix 1
And a certain Mr E. H. Pringle suggested in a letter to Nature that the
stone sphere could have been a ‘mason’s plumb-bob’ and that the ‘bronze
hook and the cedar rod may have formed part of the same tool’.^
A ‘plumb-bob’ of some sort must have been used to align the slopes of
the shafts. And we have also seen how a ‘plumb-bob’ was used in the
hieroglyphic sign meaning ‘weighing’ and, by extension, ‘the balance’.
Perhaps the Great Pyramid - the terrestrial counterpart of the star Al
Nitak — was seen as a weighing device or ‘instrument’ playing its part in
some as yet unexplained attempt to restore the ‘balance’ or cosmic order of
the world, i.e. Maat^ as it was in the ‘First Time’. Let us consider this
possibility.
Juggling for balance
We saw in Chapter 3 that the Great Pyramid functions as a mathematical
scale model of the northern hemisphere of the earth on a scale of
1:43,200.^^ By transposition and extension, therefore, it should be obvious
that the monument can also serve as an architectural and mathematical
representation of the northern hemisphere of the sky}‘^
Now if we look at a cross-section of the Great Pyramid, we notice that
each of its two sets of ‘star-shafts’ - i.e. the northern and the southern in
the King’s and Queen’s Chambers respectively - are theoretically
intended to emerge at the same heights on the north and south faces of the
monument. They appear to hang out like gigantic arms balancing, as it
were, the whole geometrical scheme of the Pyramid. But there is
something curious about the position of the two chambers from which
these shafts emanate. The Queen’s Chamber hes along the centre-line of
the Pyramid. The King’s Chamber, on the other hand, is offset somewhat
to the south of the centre-line — almost as though the ‘counterweight’ on a
huge set of scales had been slid to the left in order to achieve ‘balance’.
The consequences of this curious architectural anomaly are as follows:
1 Queen’s Chamber: the ‘designed’ average angle of the two shafts is 38
degrees 08', thus forming a right angle with the faces of the pyramid
(51 degrees 52' + 38 degrees 08' = 90 degrees).^^
2 King’s Chamber: the ‘designed’ angle of the southern shaft is 45
degrees 00' and that of the northern shaft is 32 degrees 30'. This
counteracts the effects of the offset of the chamber and restores the

73. Cross-sections of the Great Pyramid showing the ‘balancing’ of the monument with the
star-shafts.



282 Appendix 1
‘balance’ of the general geometrical design.
The altitude oiAl Nitak at the meridian in 2500 BC was 45 degrees - in
line with the southern shaft of the King’s Chamber. The reader will recall
that the vernal point in this epoch was just over the Hyades-Taurus, whose
terrestrial counterpart we have identified as the region of the Dahshur
Pyramids.^*
But let us see in what epoch Al Nitak would have crossed the meridian
at 38 degrees 08' altitude - i.e. in ahgnment with the southern shaft of the
Queen's Chamber.?
Precessional calculations show that such an alignment would have
occurred in circa 3850 BC — a date that is extremely close to that favoured
by many earlier Egyptologists for the epoch ofthe ‘Unification’ which was
supposedly sealed at Ayan-Memphis.^’ It is therefore surely of interest to
note that in in 3850 BC the vernal point was positioned near the Mi Crab
Nebula, the spot on the celestial landscape — and along the ecliptic path
that we have identified as the sky-counterpart of Ayan-Memphis.
Three Wise Men
In 10,500 BC the st.zx Al Nitak in the belt ofOrion was at the lowest altitude
of its precessional cycle and Leo housed the vernal-equinox point. In our
own epoch - the epoch of ad 2000 - the other extreme of the curious
‘balancing mechanism’ of Giza is about to be reached: Al Nitak today
stands within a few arc seconds of the highest altitude that it will attain in
its precessional cycle and the vernal point is about to drift into the
constellation of Aquarius. Between the ‘First Time’ and the ‘Last Time’,
in other words, the skies have reversed themselves - literally flipped left to
right - with Aquarius now marking the vernal equinox and Leo marking
the autumnal equinox.
We wonder whether it is possible that the sages of Heliopolis, working'
at the dawn ofhistory, could somehow have created an archetypal ‘device’,
a device designed to trigger off messianic events across the ‘Ages’ - the
Pyramid Age when the vernal point was in Taurus, for example, the
Christie Age in Pisces,^* and perhaps even a ‘New Age’ in Aquarius.?
We note m this connection that in circa 330 BC, when the vernal point
was beginning its precessional drift into the ‘Age ofPisces’, the altitude of

Al Nttak (viewed from the latitude of Giza) was 51 degrees’52' — the angle
ofslope ofthe Great Pyramid. At this time the conquests ofAlexander the
Great (356-323 bc), and the resulting merger of the Eastern and Western
worlds, triggered great expectations of a messianic ‘Return’ in the East.
First at Alexandria, then across the Levant, a general agitation began, as if
triggered by some prophetic ‘device’, which culminated in the great
messianic events of Christianity.^’
The three stars of Orion’s belt are depicted in the folklore of many
countries as the heraldic ‘Three Wise Men’, or ‘Kings’, or ‘Magi’ from the
East, who feature in the Christie nativity story.Interestingly, as we saw in
Part I, the star-worshipping Sabians ofHarran - archetypal Magi - appear
to have performed annual pilgrimages to Giza from at least as far back as
the second millennium BC until as late as the eleventh century ad.^‘
Interestingly, too, as seen from Harran - which is east ofBethlehem and at
a higher latitude than Giza - the belt stSivAlNitak would have culminated
at the meridian at 51 degrees 52' in 4 bc, the generally accepted birth year
ofChrist. In that year also the ‘birth star’ Sirius would have risen and been
brightly visible in the east as the sun set at dusk.^^
Is there something - some ancient tradition, veiled, but still very much
alive, that is subtly carrying blueprints and plans across the ages aimed at
generating messianic fervour, and changing the course of history, at
certain crucial moments which are ‘written in the stars’.?
And is such a moment now approaching.?
Is the ‘device’ about to reactivate itself?
We shall return to these questions in our next book.



Appendix 2
Precession, Proper Motion and Obliquity
Determining the positions of the bright
stars Regulus, Sirius and Alnitak in the remote past.
Unlike the fixed coordinates of latitude and longitude used by the
cartographer to determine the position ofa feature on a terrestrial map, the
astronomer’s charts have to be redrawn periodically owing to the
continually changing coordinates of the stars. This is largely due to the
effects ofprecession, with numerous other small quantities, which we shall
investigate shortly, manifesting themselves over long periods of time.
The change in position of any given star is gradual and, what with the
number of complex trigonometric and polynomial calculations to be
performed, this was immensely frustrating to the archaeoastronomer
seeking to determine the age of an architectural structure through a
suspected ahgnment with a prominent celestial body in the pre-computer
era. Fortunately, however, the vast majority ofthese effects can be allowed
for in calculations performed by desktop computers running dedicated
astronomical software.
Precession:
The Earth orbits the Sun in an almost invariable plane, known as the
ecliptic, and its axis of rotation in space is currently inclined to the
perpendicular of this plane (i.e. a line joining the north and south poles of
the ecliptic) by an angle of about 23.4°. This angle, which varies slightly
and somewhat unpredictably over large periods of time, is known as the
obliquity and is the cause of our seasonal variations.
As Sir Isaac Newton was first to explain, the precession ofthe Earth can



286 Appendix 2
be best illustrated through drawing an analogy with a spinning top: with
both the Sun and Moon exerting a gravitational influence on our planet’s
equatorial bulge (the so-called lunisolar precession) the Earth’s axis
describes a circle with a radius of almost 234° about the north pole of the
ecliptic once in a period of just under 26,000 years.
A product of general precession (that is, the sum oflunisolar precession
and planetary precession, the latter being due to the gravitational
influences ofthe other members ofthe Solar System) is the slow westward
movement of the spring and autumn equinoxes along the ecliptic on
opposing sides of the celestial sphere by about 50.3” (arc-seconds) per
annum, or 1° every 71.6 years.
This means that the vernal equinox, where the Sun crosses the celestial
equator from south to north every spring, moves backwards through the
zodiac (the band ofsky immediately either side ofthe ecliptic) at the rate of
one constellation every 2100 years or so. At present the vernal (spring)
equinox lies in the constellation of Pisces, bordering on Aquarius. Most
authorities attribute the discovery of precession to Hipparchus in 130 BC,
but there is strong evidence to support the theory that the ancient
Egyptians were a society aware of its effects. A rigorous mathematical
treatment of precession appears in Appendix II of The Orion Mystery (pages 242-249).
Nutation:
The slow processional circle of the Earth’s axis around the poles of the
ecliptic is not perfectly circular, but wavy: it is subject to small periodic
nods to and fro (nutation means ‘nodding’), the chief component of
which has a period of 18.6 years and an amplitude close to 9 arc-seconds
too small to be perceived by the naked eye. The culprit is the Moon and
the effect is due to its relative proximity, changing position with respect to the Sun and distance.
Aberration of starlight:
Another correction that has to be applied to the mean position of a star.



Precession, Proper Motion and Obliquity 287
which is also imperceptible to the naked eye, is due to the finite velocity of
light and the Earth’s orbital speed about the Sun of about 30 kilometres
per second. This has the effect of displacing the position of a star by
anything up to 20 arc-seconds, or i/i8oth of a degree.
Proper motion:
All stars are travelling through space. Younger stars that have only
recently (cosmically speaking) emerged from the stellar nurseries of gas
and dust where they were bom tend to move as a loosely bound cluster (the
Pleiades or ‘Seven Sisters’ in the constellation of Taurus are one such
example), gradually splitting up and changing direction with time under
external gravitational influences.
The quantity we term proper motion is the motion of the star
perpendicular to our line ofsight and is usually split into two components.
These are right ascension and dechnation, which are the two principal
coordinates used on the celestial sphere which are analogous to latitude
and longitude on the Earth. The movements are small owing to the
immense distances of the stars, but the effects are cumulative and reveal
themselves during the long periods of archaeoastronomical investigation.
The largest proper motion known belongs to a stellar body, Barnard’s
Star, which traverses the sky at. a rate of 10.3 arc-seconds per year, or a
degree every 350 years. The brightest star, Sirius, also has a relatively large
proper motion in declination of about -1.21 arc-seconds per annum,
travelling in a southerly direction with respect to the background stars
covering a distance equivalent to the width of the Full Moon every 1500
years or so.
Refraction:
Next to long-term precession, this phenomenon introduces the largest
displacement of a star’s apparent position that the researcher is likely to
encounter, yet the cause is close to hand and only noticeably effects objects
that are close to the horizon. When observing a star at a very low altitude
we are looking obliquely through a thick layer of atmosphere which has a



288 Appendix 2
slight lenticular effect, bending the light rays slightly and making the
object appear higher in the sky that it really is. Refraction also makes
celestial bodies rise earlier and set later than calculations would otherwise
suggest. Even so, the largest displacement ofa star close to the horizon is in
the region of 0.6°, or slightly larger than the Full Moon.
Obliquity:
The present 23.4° inclination of the Earth’s axis to the ecliptic is not fixed
and for the last few centuries it has been decreasing slightly. If high
precision is required, then the following empirical polynomial expression
is valid for about 500 years, where T is the number ofJulian centuries of
36,525 ephemeris days from the 1900.0 epoch:
Obliquity = 23.452294° - 0.0130125° T - 0.00000164° +
0.000000503°
However, over longer periods of time, the formula begins to break
down and other methods have to be employed. These largely rely on
mathematical models of the Solar System as applied to the Earth/Moon
system. The largest uncertainty in the computation ofthe obliquity by this
method arises from the unpredictable changes of dynamical ellipticity of
the Earth that can occur during an ice age. An intensely mathematical
treatment of the matter is given by Laskar, Joutel and Boudin in the
Journal ofAstronomy and Astrophysics, no.270, pp.522-533 (1993). From
their findings, the apparent limits of the obliquity are 22° to 24.5°, though
these values are far from certain.
Computing the positions of Regulus, Sirius and Alnitak in the past:
Applying corrections for the principal terms discussed above with a
program called Sky Chart 2000.0 running on an Apple Macintosh
computer, the following data was obtained at various dates for the stars

Appendix 3
Correspondence with Mark Lehner
Concerning Chapter 5
The Egyptologist Mark Lehner was sent the first draft ofChapter 5 ofthis
book, a chapter that largely concerns himself. His comments and
corrections were taken into account, and the draft was rewritten in the
form that is published herewith. When Dr Lehner was sent the revised
draft he wrote us the following letter making further comments which we
agreed to reproduce in full as an Appendix. Our own reply to Dr Lehner’s
letter is also appended.
From: Mark Lehner
To: Mr Robert G. Bauval and Mr Graham Hancock
November i6, 1995
Dear Graham and Robert,
Thank you for your letter of 12 November 1995 and for the second draft
of your Chapter 5, ‘The Case of the Psychic, the Scholar And the
Sphinx’(!). It appears to be much more accurate than the first draft
concerning the events of which I was a part.
I have the following observations to make and corrections to suggest
(again open to the public):
p. 86: ‘his pronouncements ... spawned multi-million dollar
industry . .. embroiled . . . with mainstream Egyptological



Correspondence with Mark Lehner Concerning Chapter 5 291
research .. . first learned about ... when reviewing ... Mark
Lehner.’
Do you mean to convey that Cayce alone (without theosophy,
anthroposophy, freemasonry, astrology, sacred metrology, channeling,
UFO aficionados, and Shirley MacClaine) spawned a multi-million dollar
industry that fed direcdy into my involvement with Egyptology? That
would be a little absurd.
p. 92: ‘The equipment for RSI’s work. . . Immediately after¬
wards the project was stopped.’
This is still not quite right. The drilling equipment was tested and used
elsewhere, for example, west ofthe Second Pyramid, before it was brought
down for the two holes in the Sphinx Temple. The project was not
stopped immediately afterwards. RSI/SRI drilled two more holes in the
southeast comer ofthe floor ofthe Sphinx and under the south forepaw of
the Sphinx. Then the project kind of fizzled to an end because of the
falling out between RSI and SRI and, as I remember, because the SRI
team had been in Egypt for a couple of months or more and had other
work.
p. 92: ‘did not appreciate . . . led to ... falling out between RSI
and SRI.’
As I recall, although RSI did not appreciate particularly the Cayce
involvement, the falling out between RSI and SRI was over fiduciary
issues. Why don’t you contact SRI and ask them?
p. 93: ‘Adding to the intrigue ... yet another project financed by
the Edgar Cayce Foundation.’
You do want to hang on to that intrigue! No, this was not yet another
project. The down-hole immersion acoustical sounding was done in the



292 Appendix 3
last days of SRI’s fieldwork at the Sphinx in 1978, not 1982, not another
project. I do not have, at present, a copy ofthis Venture Inwardhut ifit says
this is another project in 1982, it is wrong. All that I describe in the quote
you excerpted happened the last few days of the 1978 project.
p. 93: ‘a survey, as the reader will recall, . . . abrupt halt...
Antiquities Organization.’
You seem inclined to see ‘abrupt halts’. You should not cite me to verify
this point because I was not at these events, but my impression is that
Schoch, West, and Dobecki were not thwarted in their first season ofwork
at the Sphinx. Permission for such work is granted or denied by a large
committee of the Supreme Council for Antiquities (formerly Egyptian
Antiquities Organization).
p. 94: ‘Pulling Away. When, exactly. Professor Lehner began to
pull away from the influence of the Edgar Cayce Foundation and
crossed over into the mainstream ofprofessional Egyptology and
its orthodoxy is not especially clear.’
Are you suggesting, based on your own understanding of how behef
systems operate, that there are definite lines where ‘now you believe’ and
‘now you don’t’.? You seem particularly interested in this question. The
way you frame it reminds me of the US Congressional hearings on the
Watergate cover-up conspiracy: ‘What did the President know, and when
did he know it.?’ ‘What did Lehner beheve, and when did he not believe it.?!’
Let me offer some biography to use if you so choose.
I already had doubts when I went to Egypt in 1973, since Cayce’s
ancient history did not agree much with anthropology courses I took at the
University of North Dakota. But as I indicated in my last letter, I did
indeed have hopes that evidence could be found of past events bearing
some agreement with Cayce’s story.
During my two years at the American University in Cairo I majored in
anthropology, and took my first courses in Egyptian archaeology and



Correspondence with Mark Lehner Concerning Chapter 5 293
prehistory. I also spent most of my free time at Giza, and I visited other
ancient sites and archaeological projects. I did not find ‘footprints of the
gods’. By becoming acquainted with a vast amount of previous archaeo¬
logical research with which the Cayce community and like-minded Egypt
enthusiasts are only minimally familiar, I found the ‘footprints’ ofpeople
their tool marks, names, family relationships, skeletons, and material
culture.
In 19741 read social psychologist Leon Festinger’s work on ‘cognitive
dissonance’, in particular his book. When Prophecy Fails. Festinger deals
with people reacting to conflict between a revealed belief system and
empirically derived information, that is, physical evidence. In his work, I
recognized many attributes of the Cayce worldview, my own belief, and
my growing doubts.
When I returned to Virginia Beach I would outline in lectures and
conversations the real achaeological evidence surrounding the Sphinx and
the Pyramids and its conflict with the Cayce picture of Egypt. I spoke to
my good friends and supporters, like Hugh Lynn and Joseph Jahoda (are
your two unnamed ARE men supposed to remain as mysterious as ‘The
Scholar’.?), about my doubts, and how the Cayce community and belief
system fits many aspects discussed by Festinger and other social scientists.
In these talks I began to suggest to the Cayce community that they look
at the Egypt/Atlantis story as a myth in the sense that Joseph Campbell
popularized, or that Carl Jung drew upon in his psychology of archetypes.
Although the myth is not literally true., it may in some way be literarily true.
The Cayce ‘readings’ themselves say, in their own way, that the inner
world of symbols and archetypes is more ‘real’ than the particulars of the
physical world. I compared Cayce’s Hall of Records to the Wizard of Oz.
Yes, we all want the ‘sound and fury’ and powerful wizardry to be real,
without having to pay attention to the little man behind the curtain
(ourselves). In archaeology, many dilettantes and New Agers want to be
on the trail of a lost civilization, aliens, yes, ‘the gods’, without having to
pay attention to the real people behind time’s curtain and without having
to deal with the difficult subject matter upon which so-called ‘orthodox’
scholars base their views.
(An aside: So a John West can blast Egyptologists for suppressing the
sacred science inherent in Egyptian culture without being able to read
Egyptian language - a little like saying one knows Shakespeare’s real



294 Appendix 3
meaning without reading English. Another pyramid theorist said, in an
animated dinner conversation, ‘Where’s the evidence.? The pyramid
stands out there with no evidence ofhow the ancient Egyptians could have
built it.’ I ticked off four Egyptological titles — all in English — devoted to
ancient Egyptian tools, technology, stone building, and materials and
industries. Although he had published a widely acclaimed book with a new
theory on the pyramids, he admitted to not having read a single one of
these basic works. It would be so much more fun and challenging if such
theorists did actually read and absorb such primary sources, and then
launched the dialogue.)
These ideas were on my mind as I joined my first ‘mainstream’
excavation in 1976. They are reflected in my statement that the Hall of
Records is worth looking for, but not in a tangible way. You know, like the
Holy Grail.
In 1977-781 had the opportunity not only to work with the SRI project
at Giza, but also to work with Zahi Hawass in excavations of ancient
deposits neglected by earlier archaeologists in the northeast comer of the
Sphinx floor - just beside the north forepaw, and on the floor of the
Sphinx Temple. We recovered pottery, parts of stone tools, and other
material directly on the floor, filling deep crevasses and nooks and crannies
- material in contexts that only make sense as left by the Old Kingdom
Sphinx and pyramid builders.
Such findings, and the negative results of the SRI project, sealed it for
me. That is, I knew there was an extremely low probability that Cayce’s
story of Egypt and the Giza monuments (and his ancient ‘history’
involving Atlantis, etc.) reflected real events.
My interest in the Cayce-like genre of literature as having anything to
do with the archaeological record was gone, although I am still interested
in this genre as a social and literary phenomenon. My encounters with
bedrock reality were far more fascinating. I was excited by the process of
reconstructing the past from empirical evidence. I put aside my interest in
the dynamics of beliefs, and in general questions of philosophy and
religion, as I spent the next decade doing archaeological fieldwork for
projects at various places in Egypt. At Giza, my interest and research was
no longer premised on Cayce or any similar point ofview. In 19821 carried
out the research and writing for an Egyptological monograph on the tomb



Correspondence with Mark Lehner Concerning Chapter 5 295
of Hetepheres (published in 1985 by the German Archaeological
Institute). Cayce ideas had nothing to do with this work.
Meanwhile Hugh Lynn Cayce (until he died), Charles Thomas Cayce
and other members of the Cayce community remained very close friends.
Some (but not all) were still interested in contributing to research at Giza.
Their support of the Pyramids Radiocarbon Dating Project was a way to
do something useful for the archaeology of the pyramids, as well as to test
their ideas about the origin and date of the Great Pyramid and Sphinx.
I remember a very personal moment in 1983 when I was working for an
expedition at Abydos, the cult center ofOsiris in Upper Egypt. The tombs
of Egypt’s earliest pharaohs were sunk into a spur of low desert far to the
west of the cultivation, near the base of the great cleft in the high cliffs,
probably seen by the ancients as symbolizing the entrance to the
Netherworld. Many centuries later, one of the tombs of a real man who
ruled as one ofthe First Dynasty kings was outfitted as the Tomb ofOsiris.
Over subsequent centuries hundreds of pilgrims left pottery offerings,
resulting in mounds of millions of shards that masked the site, prompting
its Arabic name, Umm el-Qa-ab, ‘Mother of Pots’. One evening near
sunset I walked from the dig house to Umm el-Qa-ab. I stood on the
mounds above these tombs and wondered if the ancient pilgrims really
believed the god Osiris himself was buried here, and if‘those who sit near
the temple’ (as a Zen proverb would say) - the local priests - knew they
had simply outfitted one of the First Dynasty tombs of a pharaoh to
‘symbolize’ the burial of Osiris. I thought of my own pilgrimage that
brought me to Egypt in the first place, and the myth ofthe Hall ofRecords.
I realized that this was part of a worldview that had moved far away from
me, like a chunk of ice that had separated from a continent and was now
melting in a distant sea.
Sorry to be so long-winded. But Graham, I agree with your statement in
your last letter that readers should be in possession of the facts to evaluate
the opinions of academic authorities.
Sincerely,
Mark Lehner

8 December 1995
Dear Mark,
Thank you for your further letter of 16 November 1995 in response to our
revised draft of Chapter 5. We greatly appreciate your openness.
If you have no objections, we propose to publish the revised draft of
Chapter 5 as you have seen it and to publish your 16 November 1995 letter
in full as an appendix to our book. We consider this to be a fair and
reasonable way to present the whole matter to the public. If we don’t hear
back from you in the next couple of weeks we will assume this is OK with you.
Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
Warm best wishes,
Graham Hancock
PS We remember one Egyptological title (not four) that you ‘ticked off
during a certain ‘animated dinner conversation’. The one title was Clarke
and Engelbach’s Ancient Egyptian Construction and Architecture. We’ve
both read it since and weren’t overly impressed. Robert Bauval, as you
know, is a construction engineer by training and spent twenty years

actually building enormous buildings in the Middle East. In my opinion
Clarke and Engelbach notwithstanding—this gives him a rather good basis
from which to engage in ‘fun and challenging’ dialogue about the
construction logistics of the Great Pyramid. There’s no substitute for real
experience no matter how many ‘primary sources’ we ‘read and absorb’.
(And by the way, in what sense are Clarke and Engelbach a primary
source.? Were they present when the Pyramid was built.? Did they build it.?)



Appendix 4
Harnessing Time with the Stars:
The Hermetic Axiom ‘As Above So Below’
and the Horizon of Giza
An observer at Giza, as anywhere else on the globe where the horizontal
view is not obstructed, will perceive the landscape as a huge circle whose
edge is the horizon with himself at the centre - hence the term ‘Horizon’
used by the ancients when referring to the Giza necropoUs. Making
apparent contact with the horizon is the celestial landscape^ the latter
perceived as a huge circular dome or hemisphere.
The ‘below’, earth-landscape, is steadfast. The ‘above’, sky-landscape,
however, appears to rotate in perpetual motion around an imaginary axis
which passes through the two poles of the earth and extends to the
‘celestial poles’ m the sky. The apparent rotation of the sky makes the
celestial orbs - the stars, the sun, the moon and the planets - rise in the
east, culminate at the meridian (an imaginary loop running due north
south directly over the observer’s head) and set in the west.
Observations of sunrise through the year will fix four distinct points,
sometimes called the colures, on the ecliptic path of the sun around the
twelve zodiacal constellations. These are the two equinoxes (spring and
autumn), and the two solstices (summer and winter). Today these take
place in the following zodiacal signs:
1 Spring equinox (21 March) with the sun in Pisces.
2 Summer solstice (21 June) with the sun in Taurus.
3 Autumn equinox (22 September) with the sun in Virgo.
4 Winter solstice (21 December) with the sun in Sagittarius.
The table below shows in which zodiacal signs the four ‘colures’ fell for a



Harnessing Time with the Stars 299
variety of different epochs:
EPOCH 10,000 BC 5000 BC 3000 BC 1000 BC 2500 AD
S. Equinox Leo Gemini Taurus Aries Aquarius
S. Solstice Scorpio Virgo Leo Cancer Taurus
A. Equinox Aquarius Sagittarius Scorpio Libra Leo
W. Solstice Taurus Pisces Aquarius Capricorn Scorpio
Strictly speaking, the term ‘colures’ denotes the two great circles of the
celestial sphere which are at right angles to each other, pass through the
poles and intersect the two equinox points and the two solstice points
respectively.
The diurnal or daily apparent motion of the sun is from east to west.
The annual or yearly apparent motion is much slower from west to east
against the background of the starry landscape through a path known as
the ecliptic, or zodiacal circle (containing the twelve zodiacal signs). Also
because of the phenomenon of the precession of the equinoxes, the four
points on the colures (the two equinoxes and the two solstices) will appear
to drift westwards at the very slow rate of 50.3 arc-seconds per year (a full
circuit in approximately 25, 920 years).
These apparent cyclical motions of the sky are, ofcourse, caused not by
the sky itself moving but by the earth’s own spin on its axis in one day, its
orbital revolution around the sun in one year, and its slow wobble-like
motion in one Great Year (of25,920 ‘solar’ years). As we have already said,
the most noticeable effect of the latter is that the four points on the colures
which mark the two equinoxes and the two solstices on the ecliptic, will
drift in clockwise direction along the great ecliptic or ‘zodiacal’ circle.
Every day there is a moment when these four points on the colures find
themselves in precise alignment with the four cardinal points of the
terrestrial globe defined by the directions due east, due south, due west
and due north on the circle of the horizon. This is when it can be said that
the sky and earth are a ‘reflection’ of each other. In archaic terminology,
this is when the ‘Hermetic’ axiom of ‘as above so below’ can be most
faithfully expressed.
At this exact moment the colure containing the two solstice points will
be looping above the head of the observer from north to south, and thus



300 Appendix 4
becomes the prime meridian of the observer. The colure which contains
the two equinox points will loop from east to west and will intersect the
horizon at due east to due west, and thus define the parallel ofthe observer.
Again, using archaic terminology, this is when the observer is at the ‘centre
of the visible universe’.
A simple yet quite precise way ofknowing when this idealistic ‘as above
so below’ conjunction takes place is to make use ofa bright star that sits on
the colure containing the two solstice points. The choice ofa bright star on
the colure as near to the winter solstice point as possible, will permit the
observer to lock the sky in the most favourable condition possible: the
precise moment ofthe rising ofthe vernal (spring) point in the east. This is
simply achieved by waiting for the star in question to transit the south
meridian. When this happens, the winter solstice point is due south, and
all the other colures lock to the remaining cardinal directions.
The effect of the precession of the vernal point, however, will cause the
chosen star to change position with time. After a century or so the star can no longer be used.
The Great Pyramid is often said to be perfectly set to the four cardinal
points. What seems more likely, as we shall see, is that it is set perfectly to
the four colure points when they transit the cardinal directions. The
setting-out of the Pyramid, therefore, is not merely directional but also,
and perhaps more especially, dependent on ‘time’.
In 1934 the French astronomer E.M. Antoniadi correctly noted that the
‘astronomical character of the pyramids (of Giza) is estabhshed by the following facts:
1. They are almost exactly, and intentionally, on the thirteth parallel of the latitude North.
2. They are marvellously orientated on the cardinal points.
3. Their inclined passageways were, with their closing, colossal
meridian instruments, by far the largest ever constructed.’ *
These confirmed facts, and also the fact that the Great Pyramid is a
near-perfect mathematical model of the celestial dome or hemisphere,
make this monument a material and earthly representation of the sky
landscape. When linked to a specific star, however, the element of‘time’ is
introduced into the equation.



Harnessing Time with the Stars 301
We recall that the ancient builders fixed the main north-south axis of
the Great Pyramid to the south meridian transit of the bright star Alnitak,
the lowest of the three stars in Orion’s belt. We also recall that the general
layout of the three Pyramids of Giza is at 45 degrees to the meridian axis
and that this peculiarity, in turn, is reflected in the sky-image of the three
stars in Orion’s belt as they appeared in c. 10,500 bc. This was no arbitrary
date, however, because it denoted the lowest point or ‘First Time’ in the
precessional cycle of Orion. To the ancients, Orion was ‘Osiris’, and the
latter, too, had a ‘First Time’ or genesis.
Computer reconstructions of the ancient skies of 10,500 bc show that
the star Alnitak was located precisely on the colure containing the two
solstice points, and nearer to the winter solstice. Ifan observer was there to
‘lock’ the perfect ‘as above so below’ condition in 10,500 bc, the image of
the sky containing the star Alnitak would convert into a ‘hologram’ on the
ground precisely in the manner we find at Giza today. That such a perfect
sky-to-earth correlation cannot be the result of some incredible ‘coinci¬
dence’ is confirmed by the equinoctial rising of Leo, which took place in
precisely the same epoch of 10,500 bc and precisely when the star Alnitak
transited the south meridian. This brought the vernal (spring) equinox
point in perfect alignment with the Great Sphinx, the terrestrial
counterpart ofthe image ofLeo. The conclusion thus seems inevitable: the
ancients appear to have established a global prime-meridian at Giza locked
into the time frame of 10,500 bc.
All this imphes, however, that the ancients were somehow attempting
to ‘navigate’ not only in distance (‘space’) but also in ‘time’. What did they
have in mind.? How can ‘time’ be navigated.?
Hypothetically at least, a time-related apparatus locked into the colures
of 10,500 BC would present the ‘reincarnated’ Horus-King with a
subliminal landscape or ‘magical theatre’, at the height of his extensive
initiation, to work out intuitively how far in time his ‘soul’ had travelled
from its point of genesis. In Parts III and IV of this book we have shown
how the Horus-IGng may have used the phenomenon of the precession of
the equinoxes to perform such a task by inducing his mind to undertake a
journey or quest to find his ‘ancestors’ using the subliminal architectural
setting or ‘cosmic ambiance’ of Giza as some sort of‘star-memory’ device.
Today we use a computer to re-create the ancient skies on a television
monitor. We are suggesting that the Horus-King initiate could perform



302 Appendix 4
this task intuitively with the ‘computer’ of his mind and the ‘monitor’ of
his inner perception. This conclusion does not present a problem to us.
We have found that by fully familiarizing ourselves with the apparent
motions of the skies and by constantly reconstructing ancient skies with
the aid of computers, images, coordinates and epochs subliminally enter
the mind and become logged in the memory. We have discovered for
ourselves that these ‘files’ are easily retrieved at will without the
mechanistic aid of the computer. Hypothetically then, with such ‘star
memory’ logged in the mind, should we suddenly find ourselves flung into
a future ‘time zone’, say ad 6000, we could relatively easily ‘work out’
how far ahead in time we had moved.
By extension of such rhetoric, therefore, it could be said that the
function of the Giza blueprint is to provide a virtually indestructable
‘holographic’ apparatus for the use of‘reincarnated’ or ‘reborn’ entities of
the Horian lineage in order to induce ‘remembrance’ of a ‘divine’ genetic
origin in Egypt in the time-frame of 10,500 BC. The ultimate function,
however, appears to have been to perpetuate the ‘immortality’ of their
souls into ‘time’ — in short, the ultimate gnostic experience entailing the
release ofthe spiritual part ofthe living entity from its material, inert, part.
To put it in other terms, ‘living’ man is the result of a holographic union
between matter and spirit. It would very much appear that the ‘Followers
of Homs’ understood the cosmic mechanism to somehow re-separate the two.
Such questions, we are well aware, lead us into the misty realm of
metaphysics, extrasensory perception and psychic thinking from which
we have tried to steer clear. Nonetheless, we must respond to our intuitive
feeling that a form of metaphysical thinking very much like this was used
by those mysterious ‘Followers of Horus’ who set their initiatory and
astronomical’ academy at Heliopolis — and whose genius resulted in the
constmction of the amazing ‘holographic’ star/stone (spirit/matter)
apparatus of Giza. All references in the ancient texts to this mysterious
brotherhood suggest that we are dealing not with ‘priests’ but with high
adepts who fully understood the working of the human psyche and the
subliminal techniques needed to evoke ‘remote memory’ through deep
felt inner perceptions of‘time’. The esoteric teachings and initiations into
such cosmic mysteries using the skies are certainly not prosaic ones, as
Egyptologists maintain, to develop and refine calendrical systems for ‘land



Harnessing Time with the Stars 303
irrigation’ and ‘religious ceremonies’, but far more subtle: somehow to
reach and harness the extrasensory capabilities ofthe human mind in order
to link up to the invisible and immaterial, yet very perceptible, ‘flux of
time’.
The questions, for those looking for ‘scientific’ explanations, can be
formulated in another way: Do we humans carry ‘remote memory files’
locked in our genes.? And if so, can it not be possible that such ‘files’ could
be retrieved by using the correct subliminal keys.?
More provocative still: is our ‘consciousness’ umbilically linked to
‘time’ such that it merely passes through biological matter, ourselves, like
a thread passing through pearls and stones.?
It has long been appreciated by students of intellectual history that
monumental architecture and archetypal images can serve as powerful
subliminal devices to evoke dormant ‘memory’ in the minds of those who
are made receptive through initiation. The murals and panels of gothic
cathedrals or the painted ceilings such as those in the Sistine Chapel are
but obvious examples of such powerful mind-games - aptly called ‘silent
poetry’ by the fourth-century bc poet, Simonides of Ceos. These ancient
memory-aids, and the techniques refined for using them, which are
loosely termed ‘mnemotechnics’ today, were the subject of a major thesis
by Dame Frances A. Yates in 1966 entitled The Art ofMemory. In this
book Yates shows that powerful cerebral techniques were taught in ancient
Greece which were rooted in the so-called ‘Egyptian hermetic tradition’.^
Recently, the author Murry Hope, in a thesis entitled Time the Ultimate
Energy, tackled the complex subject of ‘time travel’ as a form of energy,
and suggested that pre-dynastic Egyptian adepts may have understood
and harnessed ‘time’ through a yet-to-be discovered ability to break away
from the confines of biological ‘time’ and into another mental realm of
time-perception. Murry Hope termed this realm ‘Outer Time’. Likewise,
in another recent study. From Atlantis to the Sphinx, the author and
philosopher Colin Wilson boldly proposes that the ancients may have
cultivated powerful extrasensory capabilities through ‘a different know¬
ledge system’ based on intuitive thinking (as opposed to rationalistic or
‘solar’ thinking) in order to enter higher states of consciousness. Such
higher consciousness might have been the key into altered perceptions of
‘time’.
That such untapped abilities to perceive dilated time-fields might be an



304 Appendix 4
intrinsic part of human mental machinery was very seriously investigated
by one of America’s most prestigious scientific foundations, the Stanford
Research Institute in California — better known as SRI International. In
1972 SRI International was recruited as main consultant for the so-called
remote viewing programmes run by the CIA and other government
agencies including the US navy, the US army and the US Defence
Intelligence Agency (DIA). These programmes were managed by a highly
respected physicist. Dr Hal Puthoff, who sought out and employed
renowned psychics (called ‘remote viewers’ in SRI jargon) to ‘locate’
enemy military targets and installations using extrasensory capabilities.
The reader will recall that SRI International (which has been described
as ‘America’s second largest think-tank’) was also, in 1973, involved in
high-tech archaeological projects in Egypt and, at least on one occasion,
worked in participation with the Edgar Cayce Foundation (ECF) in a
series of remote sensing projects at Giza (see Chapter 5).
Many ‘remote viewers’ involved in the remote viewing programmes,
such as the psychic Ingo Swann and Nel Riley, the latter a sergeant in the
US army, openly claimed to have the inner abilities to undertake a form of
‘time travel’ into any remote locations on the globe. Such claims are in
many ways reminiscent of those made by the Edgar Cayce adepts who
maintain that, when in an altered state of consciousness such as deep
trance or hypnosis, they can ‘remember’ past fives, i.e. ‘time travel’
mentally to remote locations. Cayce himself, who is dubbed America’s
best-known medium and psychic, claimed to have had a previous fife in
Egypt in 10,500 bc — a claim which at one time, as we have seen in
Chapter 5, was considered worthy of investigation by Egyptologist
Mark Lehner in the early 1970s within the framework of his scientific research at Giza.



Appendix 5
Carbon-dating the Great Pyramid:
Implieations of a little-known Study
The evidence presented in this book concerning the origins and antiquity
of the monuments of the Giza necropolis suggests that the genesis and
original planning and layout of the site may be dated, using the tools of
modem computer-aided archaeoastronomy, to the epoch of 10,500 BC.
We have also argued, on the basis of a combination of geological,
architectural and archaeoastronomical indicators, that the Great Sphinx,
its associated megalithic ‘temples’, and at least the lower courses of the so
called ‘Pyramid of Khafre’, may in fact have been built at that exceedingly
remote date.
It is important to note that we do not date the construction of the Great
Pyramid to 10,500 BC. On the contrary, we point out that its internal
astronomical alignments - the star-shafts of the King’s and Queen’s
Chambers — are consistent with a completion date during ancient Egypt’s
‘Old Kingdom’, somewhere around 2500 bc. Such a date should, in itself,
be uncontroversial since it in no way contradicts the scholarly consensus
that the monument was built by Khufu, the second Pharaoh of the Fourth
Dynasty, who ruled from 2551-2528 BC.‘ What places our theory in sharp
contradiction to the orthodox view, however, is our suggestion that the
mysterious structures of the Giza necropolis may all be the result of an
enormously long-drawn-out period of architectural elaboration and
development - a period that had its genesis in 10,500 bc, that came to an
end with the completion of the Great Pyramid come 8000 years later in
2500 BC, and that was guided throughout by a unified master-plan.
According to orthodox Egyptologists, the Great Pyramid is the result of
only just over too years of architectural development, beginning with the



3o6 Appendix 5
construction ofthe step-pyramid ofZoser at Saqqara not earlier than 2630
BC, passing through a number of‘experimental’ models of true Pyramids
(one at Meidum and at two Dashour, all attributed to Khufu’s father
Sneferu) and leading inexorably to the technological mastery of the Great
Pyramid not earlier than 2551 bc (the date ofKhufu’s own ascension to the
throne). An evolutionary ‘sequence’ in pyramid-construction thus lies at
the heart of the orthodox Egyptological theory — a sequence in which the
Great Pyramid is seen as having evolved from (and thus having been
preceded by) the four earlier pyramids.^
But suppose those four pyramids were proved to be not earlier but later
structures.? Suppose, for example, that objective and unambiguous
archaeological evidence were to emerge - say, reliable carbon-dated
samples — which indicated that work on the Great Pyramid had in fact
begun some 1300 years before the birth of Khufu and that the monument
had stood substantially complete some 300 years before his accession to
the throne.? Such evidence, if it existed, would render obsolete the
orthodox Egyptological theory about the origins, function and dating of
the Great Pyramid since it would destroy the Saqqara Meidum
Dashour -> Giza ‘sequence’ by making the technologically-advanced
Great Pyramid far older than its supposed oldest ‘ancestor’, the far more
rudimentary step-pyramid of Zoser. With the sequence no longer valid, it
would then be even more difficult than it is at present for scholars to
explain the immense architectural competence and precision of the Great
Pyramid (since it defies reason to suppose that such advanced and
sophisticated work could have been undertaken by builders with no prior
knowledge of monumental architecture).
Curiously, objective evidence does exist which casts serious doubt on
the orthodox archaeological sequence. This evidence was procured and
published in 1986 by the Pyramids Carbon-dating Project, directed by
Mark Lehner (and referred to in passing in his correspondence with us,
see Appendix III above). With funding from the Edgar Cayce Founda-'
tion, Lehner collected fifteen samples ofancient mortar from the masonry
of the Great Pyramid. These samples of mortar were chosen because they
contained fragments of organic material which, unlike natural stone,
would be susceptible to carbon-dating. Two of the samples were tested in
the Radiocarbon Laboratory of the Southern Methodist University in
Dallas Texas and the other thirteen were taken to laboratories in Zurich,



Carbon-dating the Great Pyramid 307
Switzerland, for dating by the more sophisticated accelerator method.
According to proper procedure, the results were then calibrated and
confirmed with respect to tree-ring samples.^
The outcome was surprising. As Mark Lehner commented at the time:
The dates run from 3809 BC to 2869 BC. So generally the dates are . . .
significantly earlier than the best Egyptological date for Khufu ... In short,
the radiocarbon dates, depending on which sample you note, suggest that the
Egyptological chronology is anything from 200 to 1200 years off. You can look
at this almost like a bell curve, and when you cut it down the middle you can
summarize the results by saying our dates are 400 to 450 years too early for the
Old Kingdom Pyramids, especially those of the Fourth Dynasty . .. Now this
is really radical... I mean it’ll make a big stink. The Giza pyramid is 400 years
older than Egyptologists believe.^
Despite Lehner’s insistence that the carbon-dating was conducted
according to rigorous scientific procedures’ (enough, normally, to qualify
these dates for full acceptance by scholars) it is a strange fact that almost no
‘stink’ at all has been caused by his study. On the contrary, its implications
have been and continue to be universally ignored by Egyptologists and
have not been widely published or considered in either the academic or the
popular press. We are at a loss to explain this apparent failure of
scholarship and are equally unable to understand why there has been no
move to extract and carbon-date further samples of the Great Pyramid’s
mortar in order to test Lehner’s potentially revolutionary results.
What has to be considered, however, is the unsettling possibility that
some kind of pattern may underly these strange oversights.
As we reported in Chapter 6, a piece ofwood that had been sealed inside
the shafts of the Queen’s Chamber since completion of construction work
on that room, was amongst the unique collection of relics brought out of
the Great Pyramid in 1872 by the British engineer Waynman Dixon. The
other two ‘Dixon relics’ - the small metal hook and the stone sphere - have
been located after having been ‘misplaced’ by the British Museum for a
very long while. The whereabouts of the piece of wood, however, is today
unknown.*
This is very frustrating. Being organic, wood can be accurately carbon
dated. Since this particular piece of wood is known to have been sealed
inside the Pyramid at the time of construction of the monument,
radiocarbon results from it could, theoretically, confirm the date when
that construction took place.



3o8 Appendix 5
A missing piece of wood cannot be tested. Fortunately, however, as we
also reported in Chapter 6, it is probable that another such piece ofwood is
still in situ at some depth inside the northern shaft of the Queen’s
Chamber. This piece was clearly visible in film, taken by Rudolf
Gantenbrink’s robot-camera Upuaut, that was shown to a gathering of
senior Egyptologists at the British Museum on 22 November 1993.^
We are informed that it would be a relatively simple and inexpensive
task to extract the piece of wood from the northern shaft. More than two
and a half years after that screening at the British Museum, however, no
attempt has been made to take advantage ofthis opportunity. The piece of
wood still sits there, its age unknown, and Rudolf Gantenbrink, as we saw
in Chapter 6, has not been permitted to complete his exploration of the shafts.

6 We have many surprising survivals from the ancient Egyptian language in the
English language. For example the small species of greyhound that we know as
the ‘Whippet’ derives its name from the ancient Egyptian canine deity Upuaut,
the ‘Opener of the Ways’. Normandi Ellis in her excellent Amakening Osiris,
Phanes Press, Grand Rapids, 1988, cites other examples: ‘amen/arm; heku
(magic utterance)/hex; neb (spiralling force of the universe)/nebulous; Satis
(goddess of the flood, or meaning enough)/satisfy; aor (magic light)/aura’.

(due 1996). The basis of his calculation is that the pressure on the soil cannot
exceed 1.5 tons/sq.m, for ramps made of compacted soil (probably covered
with stone slabs) with slopes not exceeding 8 per cent. The friction coefficient
has been calculated at 15 per cent using soaked lime as the lubricant. Kerisel
noted that a greater pressure than 1.5 tons would cause the lubricant to seep
away and thus the friction coefficient would increase, making hauling even
more difficult. The average speed has been worked out to be 0.3 metres/
second with a 13-kilogram traction force produced by each man. Thus the hauling of a 70-ton block would require (70,000 x 0.15 x 1/13 =) 807 men
and would take some 9.25 hours for a ramp of one kilometre. Kerisel worked
out that if the traction was much higher than 13 kg/man - even for a short
period of time - the result would be serious back injuries. Thus, assuming at least I clear metre distance between each standing man, 807 men in 6 rows
would need a ramp space of 134.5 metres long and 6 metres wide. The
problem, of course, is greatly increased for blocks of 200 tons within the
confined working conditions of the Sphinx and Valley Temples - a task almost impossible to imagine with such primitive techniques.

Chapter 5
I The tradition that important ‘records’ were brought to Egypt ‘after the flood’
i.e. after 10,000 BC, goes back to at least the third century BC. It is found, for
example, in The Book ofSothis (commented upon by the Byzantine historian
Georgios Synecellus who lived in the ninth century ad) and which some
scholars attribute to the Egyptian scribe, Manetho (See Garth Fowden, The
Egyptian Hermes, Princeton University Press, New Jersey 1993, pp. 29-33).
The idea is also planted in the Kore Kosmou (Excerpt XXIII of the Hermetic
writings) of the first and second century ad (See Hermetica, op.cit., p. 461). In
the Kore Kosmou (section 8) the goddess Isis claims that Thoth deposited in a
secret place the sacred books’ which contained ‘the secret things of Osiris
these holy symbols of the cosmic elements’ and then cast a spell that these
books shall remain ‘unseen and undiscovered by all men who shall go to and
fro on the plains of this land until the time when Heaven, grown old, shall
beget organisms [i.e. humans] worthy of you . . .’

in Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism and, to a certain extent, the Theosophists,
comes from the so-called Hermetic Tradition that developed in Europe in the
late Itahan Renaissance but drew its source from the Greek and Coptic texts
known as the Hermetic writings (see Frances A. Yates, Giordano Bruno and the

question. It was never expected that the outcome of the ECF’s support of my
Year Abroad at The American University in Cairo would be that I would
become a “respected Egyptologist”. ARE-affiliated people supported my stint
in Egypt because Hugh Lynn Cayce asked them to. Neither he nor I were sme
where it would lead. I think Hugh Lynn helped me to go to Egypt because we
both had some sense of destiny about it in line with the common New Age notion that it was “meant to be”.’

picked up the work of Alvarez who used cosmic rays (before I arrived in
Egypt) to analyze the Second Pyramid for undiscovered chambers. I met the SRI team in 1977 about the time they did preliminary resistivity
measurements on the Sphinx. SRI was in the business of looking for hidden
chambers at Giza well before I or the Edgar Cayce Foundation met up with them.’

44 The Edgar Cayce Foundation had commissioned and funded a Carbon-14
dating project of the Giza monuments directed by Mark Lehner in 1983-4.
Apparently small charcoal samples were extracted from the ancient mortar in
the core’s joints. The results gave a wide range of dates for the Great Pyramid
- between 3809 BC to 2853 bc - which is a few centuries earlier than the c.
2600 BC date assigned by Egyptologists, but very far from the 10,500 bc date
given in the Cayce Readings. Although many doubts have been raised
concerning the validity of the results (see Venture Inward issues May—June
1986 and November—December 1986), this, and other archaeological evidence
Mark Lehner came across at Giza, appears to have undermined his beliefs in
Cayce’s readings. For further details of the carbon-dating see Appendix 5. 45 Venture Inward, May-June 1986, p. 56. 46 Ibid., p. 57.

49 Ibid. In his letter to us, op.cit., p. 5, Lehner elaborated: ‘I am happy that my
professional work developed out of a more personal quest — call it what you
will, philosophical, spiritual, ethical. Rather than look only for agreement with
notions I had already conceived before coming to Giza - that is, what I wanted
to be true -1 looked for ways to test these and, later, other ideas about ancient
Egyptian cultural development. I found few resemblances between the
physical evidence and Cayce-derived ideas of an earlier civilization at Giza.
But I did find the pyramids to be very human monuments. Because there is
such an abundance of evidence of real people and an Egyptian society building
the Sphinx and the Pyramids, it seems culturally chauvinistic to ascribe these
monuments to a different, conveniently lost, civilization on the basis of
“revealed” information and ambiguous patterns. My work is still part of a
lifelong quest for meaning. I would not change the path that led me to Giza even if I could.’

43 No one knew of this attempt by the Dixons to probe the shafts with an iron
rod until Rudolf Gantenbrink, in early 1992, explored the northern shaft of
the Queen’s Chamber with a robot mounted with a mini-video camera. The
rod still lies there, inside the shaft, at about 8 metres from the entrance and
runs to the ‘corner’, some 24 metres up the shaft. Gantenbrink could not take
his robot roimd the corner but he managed to see, with the video camera, that
it runs for a further two metres or so and then turns sharply back on track.
What lies at the end is still unknown.
44 The Dixons, who were iron structural contractors from Newcastle, were
building a bridge across the Nile near Cairo. The iron rod they used seems to
have been purpose made to probe the shaft. It was cut in lengths of
approximately 12 feet then assembled together with sleeve-joints as the rod
was pushed within the shaft. It seems to have been stuck at the upper end,
forcing the Dixons to abandon it.

mentioned them in more recent times.

The shafts were concealed yet, in a curious manner, their position was obvious
once a logical correlation was made with those in the King’s Chamber above
as Waynman Dixon finally did in 1872 (see I. E. S. Edwards, The Pyramids of
^Syptj op.cit., 1982 edition, p. 123). Once the openings were found, then
natural curiosity would urge a deeper probe into the shafts. Dixon, in fact,
frantically probed inside these shafts with metal rods in the hope of finding
relics or a ‘chamber’, but his technology was not yet sufficiently developed to ‘see’ what he was doing.

10 A curious letter was mailed by the inspector Muhammad Shahy to Rudolf
Gantenbrink dated 5 August 1993 — i.e. five months after the discovery. Shahy
(better transliterated as Sheeha) wrote: ‘I’m in troubles now because of your
project... I shall face questioning soon.’ The young inspector was also
worried that he could not write a report on this project because ‘there is no
reference here’ (this letter was shown to the authors by R. Gantenbrink). We
have been unable to make contact with Mr Muhammad Shahy.
11 The statue went missing on the 19 January 1993, when it was supposed to be
displayed to President Mubarak and his guest, Libya’s President, Muammar
Gaddafi, on a table near the Sphinx. It may have been stolen by the same
smuggling gang that was rounded up in March 1995 (see The Times of London
12 and 13 March 1995).

S. Edwards, The Great Pyramid, op.cit., 1993 edition, p. 151 and also in
various education manuals on the Great Pyramid. Should a major find be
made when the ‘door’ is opened - even though, as now seems likely, not by
him - it will be entirely because of his efforts and bold imagination.

references to ‘stars’ ‘star-souls’, ‘the sun-god’, ‘the sky’, ‘the Milky Way’ etc., that make the Pyramid Texts obvious candidates for a proper astronomical investigation into their content and hidden meaning. The intense concept of
‘time’ — especially the ‘time’ of the ‘sky gods’ and of a cosmic ‘Creation’ — that is found in these texts strongly suggests that the science of precession is also
an important factor to apply on such an esoteric literature. The best

8 A great deal of confusion has resulted from a failure to understand that the Duat is a fixed location in the sky (obviously encompassing Orion, Canis
Major, Taurus and Leo) which has its counterpart on the land and, as the case may be, imderneath the land. Access to it was deemed possible by either ascending to the sky or by going underground.

ground floor of the ‘Egyptian’ wing. It meastires some 135 x 92 cm. (approx. 4
X 3 feet) and is badly damaged at the centre - apparently due to it being used
as a grinding millstone before its discovery by archaeologists. It contains 62
columns of hieroglyphic inscriptions. Miriam Lichtheim, who gives a full
translation, wrote that ‘the language is archaic and resembles that of the
Pyramid Texts’ (Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature Vol. i: The

walls of Memphis. It is the present-day location of the village of Mit Rahin.
37 Where Ayan existed there remain, today, the vestiges of a ruined Graeco
Roman fort which must have been built in the Egyptian style (as the broken
columns which still can be seen there attest) and which, curiously enough, is
known by the locals as the ‘prison ofJoseph’ (the Biblical patriarch who was
kept in the ‘round tower’ by Pharaoh — see Genesis 39:21). It can be reached
along the narrow canal road opposite and north of the Memphis Museum.

civilisation possible in Egypt. . . even more compelling was the fact that the
heliacally rising Sirius (the dawn rising) and the rising of the Nile coincided,
approximately, with the summer solstice.’ Interestingly, Pyramid Texts Hnes
1131 3.nd 1172 speak of the Great Flood’ which is in the sky as seen in the
east of the sky at dawn. This matches the actual celestial picture in c.
2800-2500 BC, when the Milky Way would rise due east on the pre-dawn of the summer solstice.

14 Ibid. The first rising of a star after a prolonged period of invisibility is at
dawn, about one hour before sunrise. Sirius has its heliacal rising today in
early August. In c. 3000 BC this occurred in late June. The ‘shift’ from a fixed
fK)int such as the summer solstice is about seven days every millennium. See

16 The ecliptic passes a few degrees north of the Hyades and thus just ‘west’ or
on the ‘right’ bank of the Milky Way as viewed at the meridian. In c. 2500 BC
the vernal point would have been located there.

26 Among all modern Egyptologists it is only Schwaller de Lubicz, as far as we
know, who realized the immense implications of the stellar-solar conjunction
in Leo during the Pyramid Age - a conjunction that could hardly have gone
unnoticed by the ancients since it occurred not only at the summer solstice but

also at the heliacal rising of Sirius. Lubicz wrote: ‘It is signihcant also that
tradition had already related the heliacal rising of Sirius with the beginning of
the Nile’s flooding and with the constellation of Leo; indeed since the
foundation of the calendar to the beginning of our era, in Egypt the sun was
always situated in the constellation of Leo at the date of the heliacal rising of
Leo’ (Sacred Science, op. cit., p. 176). The tradition which Schwaller is
alluding to is also confirmed by several Greek and Roman chroniclers who
passed through Egypt in ancient times. Harpollon, for example, who visited Egypt in the fifth century, commented that: ‘Lions were a symbol of the
inundation in consequence of the Nile rising more abundantly when the sun
was in Leo. Those who anciently presided over sacred works made the
waterspouts and passages of fountains in the form of lions . . .’ (Harpollon Book I, 21). The same is stated by Plutarch, who came to Egypt in the first
century ad. Plutarch is distinguished for being the only scholar in antiquity to
have compiled a full coherent account of the Osiris and Isis myth. He held a
high position as a magistrate in Boeotia and also belonged to the priesthood of
Delphi. In about ad 50 he compiled his celebrated De hide et Osiride (On Isis
and Osiris) after consulting Egyptian priests in Egypt, who also told him of the
astral rituals of the summer solstice: ‘Of the stars, the Egyptians think that
Sirius, the Dog Star, is the star of Isis, because it is the bringer of water [i.e. the Nile s flood]. They also hold the lion in honour, and they adorn the
doorways of their shrines with gaping lions’ heads, because the Nile overflows
“when for the first time the Sun comes in conjunction with [the constellation]
of Leo” . . .’ (see quote in R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, Sacred Science, op.cit., p. 91).
27 Richard H. Allen, Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning, Dover Publications
Inc., New York, 1963, pp. 255-6. It is the brightest star in Leo, a constellation
known as the ‘Domicilium Solis’ (’House of the Sun’). Allen makes this
curious comment but gives no reference: ‘The great androsphinx [of Giza] is
said to have been sculptured with Leo’s body and the head of the adjacent Virgo . . .’ (ibid., p. 253).

Giza, op.cit., pp. 1-156. There are various boat ‘pits’ at Giza, two of which
contained actual boats (one fully assembled in a museum south of the Great
Pyramid). Rudolf Gantenbrink has remarked that the size (and shape) of the
Grand Gallery in the Great Pyramid would be an ideal store for such a boat.

suggested by the German Egyptologist, Adolf Erman, who wrote: ‘Ro-setau
the gate of the ways, led direct to the underworld. It is possible that part of ’ this shrine has survived in the so-called temple of the Sphinx (A

54 Kerisel has recently obtained a scientific licence from the Egyptian Antiquities
Department to explore the subterranean chamber of the Great Pyramid and
test a hunch he’s had for many years that somewhere under the chamber is an
access to a hidden chamber itself connected, perhaps, by tunnel with the valley
or even the Sphinx area. In July 1995 Kerisel managed to use a high-precision
drill to make tiny boreholes into the wall of the horizontal passageway that
leads to the chamber but so far nothing has been found.

given as +24. i degrees. Thus for latitude 30 degrees the rising point would be
very close to 28 degrees. The sun’s declination at the summer solstice in c.
2500 BC was very near this point, at 23.98 degrees. Since the apparent angular
width of the sun is about 0.5 degrees, both Regulus and the sun would have
occupied the same ‘place’ in the eastern horizon at the summer solstice in c. 2500 BC.

14 Even his name is put into doubt. According to Dr Jaromir Malek, for
example, the name of Menes ‘could be completely fictitious and based on a
word-play which was misunderstood as a royal name by the later compilers of
king-lists’ (Jaromir Malek, In the Shadovp ofthe Pyramids, Orbis, London,



336 References
1986, p. 29). As for his other name, Narmer, this, too, is plagued with
confusion and doubt. On the so-called votive mace-heads and palettes found at
Hierakonpolis there is shown the image of a chieftain or ‘king’ and on the
front of his face are shown certain hieroglyphic signs, in some cases forming
the syllables ‘Nar-Mer’ and in others showing a scorpion. This has led
Egyptologists to conclude that the Menes of the king-lists is this Narmer or
‘King Scorpion’ (ibid., pp. 28-9). To overcome the obvious confusion of
having this presumed ‘last king of Predynastic Egypt’ bearing three names,
Egyptologists have arrived at the imsatisfactory conclusion that the name
‘King Scorpion’ on the votive mace-head ‘is almost certainly wrong’ and that
it must be regarded as some sort of‘large ceremonial image’. Consequently ‘if
King “Scorpion” is thus refuted,’ proposed Dr Malek, then ‘the likeliest
candidate for identification with the figure on the mace-head is Narmer’ (ibid., p. 29).

Egyptians made use of the phenomenon of precession. Sellers then focused, to
the exclusion of all else, on the idea that the ancients were tracking the heliacal
rising of Orion at the spring equinox. With this in mind she based all her
observations in the eastern horizon at the time of the spring equinox. This led
her to make precessional calculations which bracketed the ‘Golden Age’
between 7300 BC and 6700 BC, the two epochs marking the beginning and end
of Orion’s heliacal rising with the spring equinox (e.g. pp. 28 and 43).
Although the core of her thesis that the key to the ancient mystery is to be
found in the tracking of Orion’s precessional drift is spot on, her conclusion
that the measurements are to be made at the rising in the east of Orion at the
spring equinox is a curious error of judgement. For what is most surprising
about Sellers s analytical approach is that, while she correctly puts all the
emphasis of her thesis on Orion and its precessional drift, she makes
absolutely no reference to the most obvious astronomical ‘Orion marker’ in
ancient Egypt; the ‘Orion’ star-shaft in the Great Pyramid. Indeed, Sellers
completely ignores the Pyramids or any other structure in Egypt, and instead
centres her attention only on the textual material. The fact is that the Pyramid
builders and the compilers of the Pyramid Texts were not tracking Orion in
the eastern horizon but high in the southern skies, at the meridian.
24 Precessional calculations show that we live in the astronomical ‘Last Time’ of

meridian that they will ever attain in their precessional cycle.

content of Papyrus dem. Berlin 13603 he notes: ‘Heliopolis was regarded as
the centre of creation. The primordial aspect of Heliopolis is not described;
however, there is a clear allusion to the theory according to which Heliopolis
existed before the Earth was created. From the primaeval Heliopolis, so it is
explained in our text, the Earth-God created the Earth, which received the
name Mn-mfr, Memphis.’

5 Of which the earliest surviving are the Pyramid Texts circa 2300 BC.
Egyptologists accept, however that these texts are themselves transcripts (or
translations.?) of even earlier texts that are now lost to history, and that the
scribes who initially wrote them down in Egyptian hieroglyphs often did not
understand the words they were copying. According to E. A. Wallis Budge,
for example: ‘Several passages bear evidence that the scribes who drafted the
copies from which the cutters of the inscriptions worked did not understand
what they were writing . . . The general impression is that the priests who
drafted the copies made extracts from several compositions of different ages
and having different contents . . .’ In consequence. Budge concludes: ‘The
Pyramid Texts are full of difficulties of every kind. The exact meanings of a
large number of words found in them are unknown . . . the construction of the



References 339
sentence often baffles all attempts to translate it, and when it contains wholly
unknown words it becomes an unsolved riddle.’ See E. A. Wallis Budge, From

astronomy of the Great Pyramid, described in his Commentaries on the
Timaeus, shows that scholars of the time, many of whom were Neoplatonists,
understood the monument to be related to the stars. Proclus’s ideas formed
the basis of the nineteenth-century astronomer Richard Proctor’s thesis. The
Great Pyramid: Observatory, Tomb and Temple (published by Chatto &
Windus, London, 1883), who argued that the Grand Gallery was used as a sighting device for the stars.

would give 4.36 degrees of motion. But the motion is oblique to the meridian, giving some 3 degrees decrease in declination.
7 Calculations using the rigorous formula for precession corrected for nutation,
aberration of starlight, proper motion (from the most recent Yale Bright Star
Cataloge) and parallax was done by astronomer Adrian Ashford in August
1995. In circa 11,850 BC Sirius would theoretically be at the lowest point in its cycle, with a declination of-60 degrees, thus just on the south horizon. In
10,500 BC it would have had a declination of nearly -59 degrees, thus shining
brightly approximately i degree over the south horizon as seen from Giza. 8 Ibid.

12 Many passages in the Pyramid Texts, op.cit., speak of ‘roads’ to the stars and
to the sky where the deceased will become a god. For example, Utterance
667a, line 1943: ‘You have your tomb O King, which belongs to [Osiris] . . .
He opens for you the doors of the sky, he throws open for you the doors of the
firmament, he makes a road for you that you may ascend by means of it into the company of the gods . . .’

14 Ibid. Although the bearing of the Khafre causeway at 14 degrees south of east
is not in dispute, there has been some disagreement amongst scholars over the
direction of the Khufu causeway - most traces of which have been long ago
obliterated. Some authorities believe it proceeded straight on the 14-degree
bearing it takes from the Mortuary Temple of the Great Pyramid, others
believe that it started with this bearing and then changed direction, before
reaching the Valley Temple of the Great Pyramid. To give some indication of
the range of opinion on this matter see George Goyon, Le Secret des Batisseurs
des Grandes Pyramides: Kheops, Pygmalion, Gerard Watelet, Paris, 1990,
p. 140: ‘contrary to what some have long believed, the direction [of the Khufu
causeway] stays uniform and does not change direction in the valley below.’
Zahi Hawass in The Pyramids ofAncient Egypt, The Carnegie Series on Egypt,
Pennsylvania, 1990, p. 22, also shows a straight causeway on the 14-degree
bearing, but points out on page 18: ‘scholars disagree over the exact course of
the causeway, but it led to Khufu’s Valley Temple, the ruins of which lie
under the present-day village of Nazlet-el-Sammam.’

the British astronomer J. Norman Lockyer, who was able to survey the site of
ancient Heliopolis before it was obscured by the modern suburb that now
covers it, noted in passing that the principal mound on the site had a bearing
of 14 degrees south of east — i.e. the identical bearing to the Khafre causeway.
Lockyer also reminds us of ancient Egyptian traditions that Heliopolis was
founded by the Shemsu Hor^ the ‘Followers of Horus’, long before the beginning of Dynastic history (ibid., p. 74).

7 The Mi Crab Nebula is the remnant of a great supernova explosion which
occurred in c. 4500 BC, roughly when the vernal point occupied this specific
place in the sky. However, the supernova was about 5500 light-years away and
its light only started reaching our planet in c. ad 1000. It was recorded by the
Chinese and, apparently, by the North American Indians. No one seems to
have recorded it in Europe or the Middle East, which is very odd, since

16 Most Egyptologists would contest this point, but we feel that the evidence is
overwhelming in favour of a direct cultic cormection between Osiris and the
Great Pyramid. An interesting article touching upon this idea can be read in
Steuart Campbell, ‘The Origin and Purpose of the Pyramids’ in the New
Humanist, December 1990 issue, pp. 3-4, who wrote that ‘the Great Pyramid
might have been intended as a dwelling place for the spirit of Osiris’. The
French Antiquarian and Freemason, Alexandre Lenoir (see ‘A dissertation on
the Pyramids of Egypt’ in FMR No. 39, 1989) was also to claim that ‘all
considered it [the Great Pyramid] may be the tomb of Osiris’.

24 This pertinent point was raised very recently by the eminent astronomer. Dr
Mary Bruck: ‘Can the Great Pyramid be astronomically dated.?’ in The Journal
ofthe British Astronomical Society, 105, 4, 1995, PP- 161-4.

Great Pyramid’ in Discussions in Egyptology 29, 1994, pp. 29-36. Rudolf
Gantenbrink, who remeasured the angles of the shafts recently, gave a higher
‘adjusted’ value of 39.6 degrees for the southern shaft of the Queen’s
Chamber. None the less, the ‘designed’ intention to have the shafts come out
at the same level very much seems to be the case for the Great Pyramid. 26 The Orion Mystery, op.cit., pp. 222—3. 27 Ibid., p. 34.

28 Hence the ‘Fish’ symbol amongst the early Christians, denoting the ‘new age’
of Christianity marked by the vernal equinox in Pisces. The vernal point is now poised to enter the new age of Aquarius.
29 When Alexander the Great liberated Egypt from Persian rule, he was hailed
by the Egyptian priests as a divine hero and the returned ‘son of Ammon’
and by his Macedonian followers as ‘son of Zeus’. Both titles stand, of course, for ‘son of god’. After his death a ‘cult of Alexander’ was established in
Alexandria which spread with almost messianic fervour across the Fertile
Crescent. For the three centuries preluding the Christian era, Alexander (who
had died at the age of thirty-three in 323 Bc) was the archetype of the
conquering martyred ‘hero-king’ and ‘son of god’ of quasi-solar pedigree who
had unified the known world on the basis of a divine blueprint or mission. It
was thus that, in the closing years of the last century bc, the whole Roman
world, sickened by the endless civil and foreign wars, placed much hope for
the return of a ‘saviour-king’ modelled on Alexander who would unite the
empire and usher in a new golden age. This hope was very much pinned on
Augustus Caesar (Octavian) by the Roman poet ^'irgil in c. 42 bc in his
famous Eclogues (‘see how Olympian Caesar’s star has climbed the sky, the star
to gladden all our com with grain .. . your children’s children will enjoy the
fruits . . .’). In 12 BC Augustus Caesar was declared head of the Roman (thus
‘world’) religion and given the title of Pontifex Maximus - a title later to
denote the Catholic pontiffs or ‘Popes’ of Rome. Ironically, in 4 bc - the
assumed year that Christ was born - Augustus adopted Tiberius (second
Emperor of Rome who ruled from ad 14 to ad 37, thus in the ministry of
Jesus) and declared him his heir. Yet by the most unexpected twist of fate
Virgil’s prophecy was eventually to be fulfilled not by ‘Divine Augustus’ but
by a Jewish ‘saviour-king’, the Christos or Christ, fostered four centuries later
by Rome itself under the rule of Constantine the Great (see Ian Wilson,
the Evidence, Pan Books, London, 1984, pp. 134-44). It well be that
Virgil’s ‘star of Caesar’ influenced the unknown author of the gospel of
Matthew (‘We have seen his star and come to pay him homage . ..’ Matthew
2:1-9) who used the astral prophesy for the birth ofJesus. Not unexpectedly,
many of the great Italian Hermetic philosophers of the late Renaissance
(Bruno, Pico della Mirandola, Campanella, etc.) often presented Virgil as a
‘Gentile prophet’ of Christianity and the ‘Egyptian’ Hermes Trismegistos (i.e.
the Egyptian god Thoth) in par with the Old Testament prophet Moses (see
Frances A. Yates, Giordano Bruno, op.cit.). Many of these Hermetic ‘Cabala’
philosophers adamantly believed that the ‘Egyptian’ astral magic as found in
the ancient texts was the agency or ‘device’ for great world-changing events
(ibid, et al.). It can be thus argued that in the first century of our era the scene
was set in the collective subconscious by astrologer-prophets of old to bring
about a messianic event. In our next book, we will explore how such powerful
‘Hermetic devices’ were activated throughout the ages and also, as the case
may be, may be about to be galvanized in present times.

...continued from front flap
reveal in their shattering conclusion, a
covert treasure hunt has been underway
for the last twenty years at the pyramids
and the Sphinx — a hunt bringing
together senior Egyptologists, high
government officials, wealthy funders,
and a strange esoteric organisation
lurking behind the scenes.
What are they looking for? What is
contained in the rectangular chamber
that seismic surveys have located in the
bedrock far below the paws of the
Sphinx? What lies behind the mysterious
door recently discovered at the end of a
previously unexplored shaft deep inside
the Great Pyramid? And does mankind
have a rendezvous with destiny - a
rendezvous not in the future, but in the
distant past, at a precise place and time?
The secrets can be kept no longer...
ROBERT BAUVAL is a conception
engineer with a long-standing interest in
the astronomy of the pyramids, having
lived in Egypt and elsewhere in the
Middle East for much of his life. The
Orion Mystery was his first book.
GRAHAM HANCOCK is a former East
African correspondent for The Economist
and has travelled widely round the world.
He is the author of Fingerprints of the Gods,
The Sign and the Seal and Lords ofPoverty.
