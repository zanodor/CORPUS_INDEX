Erich A. von Fange, the author of Time Upside Down, reflects many years of study of the ancient world in a biblical framework in his lectures and writings.
He has long been interested in treating the truths of the Bible and the claims of science where they conflict. Noting that few Christians are equipped to deal with questions and problems in this area, and that parents especially are troubled by the questions of their children about Bible/science conflicts, he began to write a series of papers in the early 1970's under the general title of Surprises in Genesis.

TO THE READER
This book is an outgrowth of a curious reading adventure for more than 25 years. The author has read deeply into just about all sides of a very complex story - the respectable books, texts, and journals; the works of evolutionists and creationists; the uniformitarians and the catastrophists; mythologists, historians, geologists, archaeologists, and astronomers; the hollow earth theorists, the flying saucer fans, the gods-from-outer-space writers, and the proponents of Mu and Atlantis. This reading was not done out of gullibility, but rather to see just what various views and theories rested on. To a remarkable degree, it may now be said, any of the above may use the same facts to bolster any theory. In this book, however, the facts, the clues, the anomalies, are removed from the views and theories woven about them and are here examined in a new light. We want to explore how reported facts, and anomalies as well, fit into belief systems, especially belief in a young, created earth as contrasted with a belief in evolution.
ONCE UPON A TIME
Much has been written about origins. This book focuses more on the problem of time as treated by scientists and others. Generally speaking, this is a book about prehistory, those areas of the past in history where written records either do not exist or where they do not furnish as yet clear answers to crucial questions about ancient times. To this definition of prehistory we add those aspects of ancient history where Biblical accounts and other accounts (or modern assumptions) are in serious conflict.
One can't read very much about the past without running headlong into problems of time. Do we live on an ancient earth or on a young earth with an appearance of age? When one sees a fossil tooth or an insect in amber, invariably the first question is, 'How old is it?' The Christian especially, who reads widely, soon comes to agree with Shakespeare: 'The time is out of joint!' I often explain in my lectures that I believe in a young created earth, but that the Bible does not give us enough information to pin down the precise age of the world. Then the hands are raised, and the first question is: 'Yes, but what is your date for the creation of the world?'
Fossil dinosaur and mammal teeth - how old?
The following example shows that something is wildly wrong with conventional views of time. According to many textbooks, the Antarctic ice cap is 60,000,000 years old. Earliest man was thought to have emerged into history about 1,000,000 years ago, although this time is generally moved back farther with almost every news release that deals with fossil man. In the National Museum of Turkey you will find on display two map fragments dated 1513 and 1528. The maps were compiled from a number of now lost ancient originals which existed long before the time of the Greeks. At the bottom of one of these fragments is shown the coastline of much of the Antarctic continent, including rivers and mountains.

The original map, which shows amazing knowledge and accuracy, was made when the Antarctic was icefree;. Antarctic mountains and portions of the coastline depicted on the map were confirmed by scientific studies in 1952 and again more recently. The evidence of the maps cannot be ignored, according to responsible reviewers who have studied them (Hapgood, 1966).
Independent evidence of the recency of the Antarctic ice cap came to light with the discovery of 81 mummified seals in some mountain caves, 2500 feet above the present sea level (Edwards, 1964, p.160). These remains were mummified, not fossilized. It therefore follows that the caves in which
they were found were suddenly uplifted from just above sea level rather than gradually elevated by uniformitarian processes, or the remains would have turned to dust millions of years before the process had been completed. It seems reasonable to say also that the caves were used by the seals before the ice cap appeared. Seals are supposed to have evolved in Miocene times, conventionally placed between 13 and 25 million years ago. In no way can the find be placed into the context of a 60,000,000 year-old ice cap. How do scientists explain this anomaly? All they can do is say that the seals got mixed up or lost and climbed up into mountain caves 2500 feet above sea level.
If that is the case, we should find seals at similar altitudes in California and elsewhere, but of course nothing of the sort has ever been reported.
'Impossible' facts such as these have been gathered to shed new light on the past. In a way the adventure of writing these chapters began many years ago when a seminary student asked, 'What about dinosaurs?' A tough question, indeed! Behind the question was the tacit point that the testimony of Scripture and science as written in texts are worlds apart. He did not have any satisfactory answer, nor did I at that time. Our children face the same puzzle. What they learn in Sunday School is a different world than that described in their textbooks. How can parents be helped to answer their honest questions?
When we read newspapers, magazines, and books, we frequently find statements in direct conflict with statements of Scripture. Is the Bible history learned in childhood days just a comfortable fairy story to be abandoned by grownups? When we witness our faith to others, particularly to educated people, how do we go about answering honest questions about the origin and early history of the world? What do we say? Do we hope the questions never arise?
In recent decades there has been a rash of books - some of them best sellers - on some exotic subjects: Flying Saucers, the Hollow Earth, Chariots from the Gods in Outer Space, Mu, Atlantis, mysteries which science cannot explain. What can we say to others when they ask about the theories and the evidence given in the books to support the theories?
We can quote Scripture and hope that this answers the questions people raise. Its testimony of the Good News of Jesus Christ is the heart of our own faith and the faith we share with others. We do not need to try to prop up the Scriptures in order to make them more respectable and more palatable to modern man. At the same time we must learn to give a proper answer to everyone. When we speak with Romans, we must become as Romans. We can learn much from the world, including science, with the purpose ultimately of winning some for Christ. Very little of Scripture is quoted in this book. We already know the testimony of the Bible.
When we take on the world in areas where science conflicts with Scripture, we are at a great disadvantage at least in the eyes of the world. For generations the image has been projected of faithless fact, that is, the objective truths of science, opposed to the factless faith of those who somehow try to hold fast to the testimony of the Bible. We have all probably received the pitying smiles of 'enlightened' persons who have

cast aside the dull trappings of myth, legend, and Sunday School fairy tales. We are on the defensive. We are the closed minds, the parochially educated, and we are afraid to face up to the 'truths' of science which must not be questioned..
We are the ones who are so far out of it that 'educated' people can hardly believe such people still exist on our planet in our enlightened age. Name calling is common. Supposedly, the battle of the Bible versus evolution was fought and won a century ago. Why don't we face up to the facts and accommodate ourselves to the obvious?
But as we shall attempt to show in a different and unusual way, we do not need to be on the defensive. We can speak out to the world in its own language. Just as Jesus Christ in His own ministry led the people from the evidence of the world around them into spiritual matters, we too can use the testimony of the world itself in order to lead people into spiritual insights.
In presenting evidence, however, the old, old question of 'What is truth?' immediately arises. This is by no means an easy question. Theory, assumption, conjecture, and evidence have a way of blending together in a confused fashion, so that many cannot easily distinguish between them. Yet there are radical differences. Vast amounts of fog would lift if each statement were labeled for what it is in scientific writing, especially in writing about origins and about time. As we shall see over and over, the facts do not contradict the Bible only the interpretation of the facts do so.
In these chapters the reader will be confronted with startling facts in support of a young earth - facts not typically found in textbooks. If such data are used at all in texts, they may be referred to as anomalies or mysteries, but with no attempt to change the theory which they undermine. Someone has described them as the ugly little facts that destroy beautiful little theories. It should be remembered that it takes only one fact to destroy a theory. There is, of course, always some risk involved in accepting data reported in newspapers and journals. A new edition or succeeding issues of a journal or newspaper may retract 'facts' reported earlier. Readers perform a genuine service when they point out such errors to the author.
In the history of science we often note that fear of ridicule - perhaps man's most powerful weapon - has often been used to suppress uncomfortable truths from emerging. The position is taken here that such facts - if indeed they are facts - ought to be taken out of hiding for an airing. Yet, as the reader will soon discover, picking out facts is a risky business. Some sources are more reliable than others, but sometimes fraud and humbug are found in high places.
The question is not 'Are some of the reported facts possibly untrue?' This may well be and is part of any game within any aspect of science. Enough of the information in the following chapters has been validated to upset commonly held views. We know from studies of perception in psychology that people - even scientists - see the world pretty much as they want to see it, rather than objectively. A sort of scholarly amnesia sometimes occurs in the face of inconvenient data.
Are scientists dishonest? It would not be fair to assess them that way, any more than it would be fair for them so to consider a Christian. We are all trapped, as it were, in our assumptions. If the assumptions are true, then everything that follows from the assumptions is also true. For example, the geological age column was developed in England on the basis of some assumptions over a century ago, not by a geologist, but by a lawyer. It has had many millions of years added to it from time to time. It has never been subjected to verification period by period by scientific dating processes. It is as true as the assumptions on which it rests. Some scientists elsewhere in the world - no friends of the Bible - do not bother with ages of millions of years. They simply refer to zones, which may well in fact be ecological zones rather than having anything to do with time. There may be a useful lesson in this procedure.
Most scientists assume a very old, evolved world, and they use evidence which seems to support this assumption. They disregard, or reject, or label as anomaly, anything which does not support this world view.

More than a century ago Huxley stated the view of scientists this way (Victoria Institute , 1866, 2:304): You (clergy) tell your congregations that the world was made 6,000 years ago in six days, and that all living animals were made within that period...I am bound to say, I do not believe these statements you make; and I am further bound to say that I cannot call up to mind amongst men of science and research, and truthful men, one who believes those things, but, on the other hand, who does not believe the exact contrary.
A professor of biology at a state college said this (Pensee , 1972, 2:3, p.49):
For many years I have been very disenchanted with the current theories of evolution as well as those dealing with fossilization, extinction, geological processes, etc. Other biologists have argued at length with me basing their position on the claim that there is no other possible alternative.
A geology text speaks of the need to study a patient unhurried universe (Brown, 1958, p.384-385). For more than a century any sudden change has been anathema, as well as any sort of divine role in the process. In the past decade or so, however, in the face of evidence that even a child can see, it is interesting to note that the old hard-line uniformitarianism is reluctantly and slowly giving way to what is now called uniformity. The new dogma does not really give an inch, but admits that some catastrophes did have some effect on some formations. Long pauses in time are placed between catastrophic events, with no erosion taking place, to keep the total number of years for the age of the earth the same.
One candid historian (Easton, 1966, p.11-12) gives us the following illuminating statement:
In this age, on principle, we are inclined to prefer even the more farfetched of material explanations to the possibility of any kind of divine guidance or intervention, or the fulfillment of any divine purposes. Change and probability appear to us so much more scientific, and therefore more credible.
Usher assumed that the Bible gave a complete record of world chronology. It is often said that Lightfoot popularized the statement that the Creation took place at 9:00 a.m. on October 23, 4004 B.C. Other sources give this date as 376l B.C. (Hebrews); 5509 B.C. (Russian Orthodox). Hebrew, Samaritan, and Septuagint versions give variant readings on early chronology. In sharp contrast, Darwin carefully inspected the once forested, open rolling upland of England and announced its age as 306,662,400 years (Tuttle, 1865). Incidentally, Darwin advised his followers not to use too many zeroes when they estimated time, because zeroes leave the impression that one is guessing.
Each of these people above began with certain assumptions and came up with logical results that followed from the assumptions made.
Within the church, many people tend to be overawed by 'science,' and are too ready to compromise on clear Scriptural statements. But if we look at actual evidence, we can see that this situation does not need to exist.
As an aside on the matter of evidence, we are aware that we face something of a dilemma. Our fellow Christians don't need evidence if they already accept Scripture for what it says; our friends who accept another set of assumptions about the world will not believe even when confronted by evidence.
Nevertheless we continue because there are open and searching minds. There are honest questions and concerns expressed by our Christian brothers and sisters. In the rush of our daily life, with more responsibilities than we have time to cope with, it is all too easy to restrict ourselves to a narrow scope of reading. In this book a wide range of literature is used to give us some very interesting and useful insights in responding to the honest and searching questions people ask.
We expect to show that conventional dating as reported in the news media and in textbooks is radically in error and is based on assumptions that do not hold up against evidence to the contrary. If we then recognize that science is really not equipped to reconstruct the past nor to foretell the future, just how do we proceed in developing an adequate framework for ancient history? While we cannot hope to find answers to many of our questions, there is nevertheless much material available of value and interest for study and synthesis. Despite the most fervent attempts to undermine the truth of the Scriptures, the Bible remains a reliable and



2020. 11. 09. Time Upside Down
https://www.creationism.org/books/vonfange/vonFangeTimeUpDownChap01.htm 6/9
indespensable key for an attempt to reconstruct ancient history. Among events described in the Bible that need investigation are the following: the geological implications of God cursing the ground after the Fall of man; attempts to fix the point in geological time of the Flood; the curious passage about Peleg and the dividing of the earth; the consequences of Babel when men were subsequently 'splattered' across the face of the earth; the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah; the plagues and the Exodus; events recorded in the Bible around the time of King Hezekiah; amd the astonishing number of Old Testament passages that refer to catastrophic events.
In recent years a number of scholars have urged that universal myths and other ancient writings need decoding for the truths they contain about man's past. As one example of many that could be cited, Stahlman urges a new approach to the study of prehistory. He notes that modern man revels in the denial that ancient myth has truth value, that historians have blinded themselves to essential clues that lie right before their eyes, and that they misuse the biological seedbed of evolution by trying to apply evolution to history. He scolds the simplistic notion that all fields of knowledge are very modern and that they simply evolved (Saturday Review , 1/10/70, p.100). In sharp contrast to scholars who urge that we extract truth from myths, evolutionists attempt to force captive audiences into believing that the Bible is only myth.
The value of research in geology, palaeontology, ancient astronomy, and archaeology will become obvious from the content of this book. Much of the focus of these fields is on painstaking analysis. These findings form the raw material for syntheses that are based on new assumptions and an appropriate model of prehistory based on the Bible.
Other scholars have pointed to the value of word and language studies including ancient place names, many of which have come down to modern times, as important clues to prehistory.
The failure in current attempts to write a satisfactory account of prehistory is that the evidence runs completely counter to evolutionary assumptions. Historians know that something is wrong, but they are frustrated by a lack of any 'respectable' alternative. We can hardly appreciate how bad the situation is unless we listen to examples of scholars scolding other scholars.
One historian, more candid than most, says the truth is that we know very little indeed about prehistoric man. Our ignorance is almost total, and no two experts tend to agree on what little we do know. Although Easton accepts biological evolution, he does not want it applied to history (Easton, 1966, p.11). This is what he has to say:
There are still many inconvenient facts, which seem very difficult to explain on the basis of natural selection; and the entire theory (of evolution), if viewed dispassionately often seems to a layman so extraordinarily unlikely as an explanation of how the present...including man evolved, as to suggest a willful perversity in present-day man.
de Santillana and von Dechend (1969, p.65-66) state that the lazy word 'evolution' has blinded us to the real complexities of the past. The simple idea of evolution, which is no longer thought necessary to examine, spreads like a tent over all those ages that lead from primitivism into civilization. Gradually, we are told, step by step, men produced the arts and crafts, this and that, until they emerged into the light of history... These soporific words 'gradually' and 'step-by-step,' repeated incessantly, are aimed at covering an ignorance which is both vast and surprising. One should like to inquire: 'Which steps?' But one is lulled, overwhelmed and stupefied by the gradualness of it all, which is at best a platitude, only good for pacifying the mind, since no one is willing to imagine that civilization appeared in a thunderclap.
Yet the word 'gradually' leads into all sorts of difficulties, and so the word 'suddenly' is used to explain what cannot be explained by the word 'gradually.' Marshack (1972, p.11) is disturbed by the frequent use of this word in historical writing, for example, science began suddenly with the Greeks, other sciences appeared suddenly in Mesopotamia and in Egypt, civilization itself had begun suddenly in the Fertile Crescent, writing began suddenly, agriculture appeared suddenly, and the calendar suddenly appeared fully developed. As French scientist Bounoure said so elegantly, 'Evolutionism is a fairy tale for grownups. This theory has helped nothing in the progress of sciences. It is useless' (CRSQ , 1966, 3:1, p.4).

With only one 'respectable' option, however, that is, evolution, open to scholars today, there is in their minds simply no intellectually honest way they can write prehistory, except to repeat parrot-like what others wrote before. It is interesting to see that more and more writers of ancient history texts are copping out. Instead of writing the usual Chapter 1 on the caveman, followed by Chapter 2 on the Greeks, with perhaps a nod toward Egypt and Mesopotamia, they are now beginning the texts with the Greeks. It is simply too embarrassing for them to keep on writing the same old first chapter, generation after generation, which bears no relation to what follows. Even historians can see that you don't chip rock tools one day and then build mathematically perfect pyramids the next.
Any attempt to reconstruct ancient history must cope with the fact of a Golden Age before the time of Abraham, and of which by comparison the Greeks were little children. More than a century ago a scholar observed that man has not originated from a state of barbarism, and then risen to civilization; but that, wherever man has been found in a state of barbarism, it is barbarism arising from a degenerated civilization. All known peoples with a knowledge of their past have some tradition of their having been raised from barbarism by a people more civilized than themselves (Victoria Institute , 1867, 3:21-22).
Stefansson, the great explorer, stated that to those of us brought up the traditional way, where navigation of the high seas was supposed to have started with the Phoenicians, it is more than a little against the grain to believe that man swarmed over at least three of the oceans, the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific, during remote periods. No stir was caused at an international congress of archaeologists at Oslo in 1936 when the president of the congress lectured about a Golden Age of deep-sea navigation at its height long before
the time of Abraham and which was on the decline after 1500 B.C., so that the very period which we select as the beginning of real seamanship is shown as having been only a pale image of what had been earlier (Stefansson, 1942, p.25-26). The evidence presented in books such as Hamlet's Mill (1969), Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings (1966), and Children of the Sun (1923), is compelling and fascinating.
Ancient man's total obsession with and terror of the planets call for radically different treatment of the role of astronomy in the ancient world than what is customary today. Strange events occurred in historic times that had dreadful consequences on the earth. de Santillana (1969, p.65-66) notes that modern archaeological scholars have been singularly obtuse by cultivating a pristine ignorance of astronomical thought which plays a crucial role in ancient history. Besides the terror factor, the ancients knew from the stars precisely where they were anywhere on the earth. The ancients knew when they crossed the equator, and could find remote specks of islands thousands of miles away in the oceans (Victoria Institute , 1897, 33, 274).
von Dechend, a scholar of ancient history, determined never to become involved in astronomical matters, under any conditions. When she discovered two prehistoric shrines on two little specks of islands in the Pacific, one precisely on the Tropic of Cancer and the other precisely on the Tropic of Capricorn, the facts struck her like a sledgehammer, according to her own report, and she surrendered. There was no salvation for her anymore - astronomy could not be swept aside (de Santillana, 1969, p.ix).

No reconstruction of ancient history can be valid without treatment of catastrophic events. Darwin personally examined evidence of catastrophic events and passed them off as insoluble problems, giving them no place in his theories. He was ready to concede, however, from his study of the recent and sudden upheaval of the Andes, that the resulting catastrophe might have produced world-wide flood traditions (Victoria Institute , 1868, 4:255; 1887, 23:214).
Such events still happen today on a lesser scale. Recently the press reported that a mountain in the Caucasus moved 1.2 miles, blocking off a river along the way. yet fields, crops, and huts on the mountain remained intact (Ann Arbor News , 7/5/72).
More and more scientists are looking seriously at the evidence documenting the following description of catastrophes in historic times (Velikovsky, 1955, p.261):
Hurricanes of global magnitude, of forests burning and swept away, of dust, stones, fire, and ashes falling from the sky, of mountains melting like wax, of lava flowing from riven ground, of boiling seas, of bituminous rain, of shaking ground and destroyed cities, of humans seeking refuge in caverns and fissures of the rock in the mountains, of oceans upheaved and falling on the land, of tidal waves moving toward the poles and back, of land becoming sea by submersion and the expanse of sea turning into desert, islands born and others drowned, mountain ridges leveled and others rising, of crowds of rivers seeking new beds, of sources that disappeared and others that became bitter, of great destructions in the animal kingdom, of decimated mankind, of migrations, of heavy clouds of dust covering the face of the earth for decades, of magnetic disturbances, of changed climates, of displaced cardinal points and altered latitudes, of disrupted calendars and of sundials and water clocks that point to changed length of day, month, and year, mountains springing from plains and other mountains leveled, strata folded and pressed together and overturned and moved and put on top of other formations, melted rock flooding enormous areas of land with miles-thick sheets, ocean and lake shores tilted or raised or lowered as much as a thousand feet, whales cast out of oceans onto mountains, the Alps and the Rocky Mountains moved as much as a hundred miles.
In this context, 'mountains skipping like rams' sounds very tame indeed. There is a great deal of evidence that this passage from the Psalms is an accurate eye-witness report.
As prehistory blends into recorded history, a problem of ancient chronology exerts a crippling effect on both the study of the Old Testament and on ancient history in general. Evidence is accumulating that parts of Egyptian chronology may be off by as much as 500-600 years. Since most scholars calibrate Old Testament events and the history of other ancient cultures by Egyptian dates, the effect is devastating crippling, and stifling. If in the future major adjustments are found valid for the chronology of Egypt, the spinoff for Middle East archaeology and for Old Testament studies will be spectacular. We do not hesitate to say that there are many intriguing questions, problems, and puzzles about which the Scriptures are silent. Neither science nor the Bible can satisfy much of our curiosity. There is plenty of room for humility on both sides.

TIME UPSIDE DOWN
By Erich von Fange Part 2
PART 1 Table of Contents PART 3
Introduction. This book focuses primarily on people's beliefs about time - time as presented from scientific sources versus time as indicated in the Scriptures. Is textbook time vulnerable? Can one break down textbook time concepts? If the answer is 'Yes,' a great deal will have been accomplished. The reader is invited to consider a wide range of evidence.
In the following pages we find to our astonishment that the real world is very unlike the one described in many texts: Geographic features of apparent great age can develop almost overnight. The layers of rocks in many parts of the world are not in the order they ought to be if evolutionary assumptions and development are correct. Scientific dating has very serious problems and shortcomings. Measurement of the strength of the earth's magnetic field strongly indicates a very young earth. Animals have been found long before or long after they were supposed to exist according to evolutionary theory. Human artifacts have been found in rocks or strata considered much older than man. Animal and human footprints have been found in 'impossible' places. Fossil remains of man are found in locations and under circumstances which cast great doubt on conventional dating and the assumption that man developed from a primitive or animal existence to a sophisticated level.
It is important to become at least modestly acquainted with the conventional geologic clock. It originated long before any real scientific approach was possible. It was carefully developed in the early nineteenth century according to uniformitarian assumptions. Vast ages were simply assumed by this approach. The tendency has been to lengthen the periods from time to time, not on the basis of scientific dating, but rather to give evolutionary principles more and more time to bring about changes required by that theory.
The following presents much food for thought, along with the suspicion that things are not always what they seem.
Surtsey Island Shouldn't Be!
Seventy kilometers south of Iceland a new island was born in 1963. This in itself is not an unusual occurrence. The following year, Sigurdur Thorarinsson (1964), Iceland's foremost geophysicist, wrote a little book about the island. Here is part of his description of the new island:
Only a few months have sufficed for a landscape to be created which is so varied and mature that it is almost beyond belief...Here we see wide sandy beaches and precipitous crags lashed by breakers of the sea. There are gravel banks and lagoons, impressive cliffs resembling the White Cliffs on the English Channel. There are hollows, glens, and soft

undulating land. There are fractures and faulted cliffs, channels and rock debris. There are boulders worn by the surf, some of which are almost round, and further out there is a sandy beach where you can walk at low tide without getting wet.
Dr. Thorarinsson comments as follows, and we must remember that the island is now just one year old. An Icelander who has studied geology and geomorphology at foreign universities is later taught by experience in his own homeland that the time scale he had been trained to attach to geological development is misleading...What elsewhere may take thousands of years may be accomplished here in one century. All the same he is amazed whenever he goes to Surtsey, because there the same development may take a few weeks or even a few days.
There are surprises elsewhere. Evidence was submitted by scientists from Harvard and Carnegie Institute that the mighty Himalayas, during violent upheavals, reached their present form and height in the age of man, in historic times. Evidence for the same phenomenon has been noted regarding the Andes, that in historic times the mountains rose many thousands of feet (Velikovsky, 1955, p.286). If at least some mountains are very, very young, what reason is there to believe that other mountains are untold millions of years old?
The ancients handed down some wild tales. One of these is

the account of the travels of the Argonauts who sailed from the Mediterranean across the Sahara (including portages) all the way to the west coast of Africa. (de Santillana, 1969, p.255). To put it mildly, the tale makes no sense at all. The Piri Reis map fragments referred to above also include a large portion of the Sahara that shows a network
of lakes and rivers which could well have been navigable in historic times (Hapgood, 1966). Some day we may have to take another look seriously at this voyage of the Argonauts. It has recently become known that abundant fresh water lies beneath enormous areas of the Sahara desert, enough probably to meet all human and animal needs several times over.
The potential up to now is scarcely tapped. There is much evidence that the desert did not exist in historic times (Norwich, 1968, p.231).
The location of the Sphinx strongly indicates that the Sahara was not a desert at the time the Sphinx was constructed. The base is repeatedly cleared, but the next wind storm covers it again (Tompkins, 1971, p.142).
In areas where even camels now turn away in despair, lush vegetation grew in historic times. Most of the Sahara was a land of lakes and rivers full of fish. There were meadows, forests, and fertile valleys offering sustenance for a large human and animal population. It staggers the mind to discover that fish harpoons have been found in many areas of the Sahara. In remote regions, rock carvings and paintings exist by the tens of thousands. Some of the cattle in these paintings wore discs between the horns as in Egyptian paintings. Some rock drawings show Phoenician work or influence. Pottery, tools, and polished stone weapons have been found in abundance. The desert did not form gradually over long eons of time. It occurred suddenly in historic times (Velikovsky, 1955, p.93; Scientific American , 214 [May 1966], 21).
Other kinds of evidence show the same kind of very rapid growth or development. When you take a tour through a cave, you have apparent evidence right before your eyes of stalagmites and stalactites that took many millions of years to form. Little specifically seems to be known about the growth rate, except that it is a vaguely slow process. Some formations are said to be about 100,000 years old since they rest on silt and fossils dated at about that age. The usual orthodox view is that only rarely will more than one hundredth of an inch be deposited per ten-year period, or one

inch in a thousand years (Pensee 3:1, p.48; CRSQ , 8:2, p.144).
Yet a writer in Nature some years ago was able to show that a stalagmite about 15 years old from a lead mine exactly paralleled in form and height another which in association with human remains had been estimated by experts as being 220,800 years old. Some authorities are suggesting that the association of human bones with long extinct animals may not be proof of the antiquity of man but rather that these animals lived into quite recent times. (Custance, 1968, p.20).
In a cave in England water passing through a lime deposit was led through a four-inch pipe. In eight weeks the diameter was reduced to only one inch and the crystallized deposit, which had grown in layers like tree rings, gave every appearance of being thousands of years old (Victoria Institute , 1879, 15:235). In New England spouts carrying water from mines become choked up with deposits within two or three years. A stalactite a foot long was found hanging under a railroad bridge in Alliance, Ohio.
Grown stalactites were found one year after the atomic explosion was set off in Gnome Cavern, New Mexico. A five-inch stalactite was found in the man-made Hetch Hetchy tunnel, California, less than 20 years after it was built. Another one, eight inches long, was found hanging from a flume in Georgia which formed in less than a century. There are numerous reports of other quick-grow stalagmites: In the Carrara District, Italy, stalagmitic deposits are a local source of income. The water is so impregnated that any object placed in it is thickly coated in two weeks. About a hundred miles from Zagreb, Jugoslavia, lakes fed by waters coming through limestone beds are so charged that deposits are more in the hour range than the century. Objects placed in these waters are soon coated by lime deposits (Victoria Institute , 1872, 8:226-228; 1883, 19:200; CRSQ, 1970, 7:4, p.243; 1971, 8:4, p.249; 1972, 9:3, p.197; Pensee, Fall 1972,2:3, p.18).
In a cave in the Tehuacan Valley of Mexico, a vast chamber known as the Hall of the Dead was found. A massive cave-in had occurred and one can still see the skeletons of people of the Olmec period there. The skeletons are all covered with stalagmites. Rather than an age in the millions of years, the skeletons are dated as no earlier than 1200 B.C. (Pensee , Winter 1973, 3:12, p.48).



2020. 11. 09. Time Upside Down

About twenty years ago the clear outline of a bat was found inside a stalagmitic deposit in Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico. It had been cemented over before bacteria, decay, or predators could destroy it. The suggestion was made that under the right conditions the growth rate of the stalagmite might be amazingly rapid (CRSQ , 1971, 8:2, p.144).
Other kinds of rock may form very rapidly. The Popular Science News reported a find of quartz crystals in a Nevada mine which could have had only 15 years maximum in which to form. In the same area a mill had been torn down and the discovery was made that sandstone had formed during a twelve-year period. In the sandstone was a piece of wood with a nail in it (Fort, 1941, p.131).
In the British Museum there is a skeleton embedded in solid rock that came from the island of Guadaloupe in the West Indies. The rock is a hard limestone and also contains fragments of shells and coral. The skeleton is that of an Indian killed in battle with the British only two centuries ago (Victoria Institute , 1877, 13:36). It was customary in the past to attribute great age to peat deposits. Scientists taught that peat forms at the rate of about one-fifth inch per century, or one foot in 6,000 years. More than a century ago, however, peat farmers said that the rate was about 2 1/2 inches per year. That is 1250 times as fast as the scientists claimed. A large number of embarrassing finds soon supported the experience of the peat farmers. In some places in Scotland, old Roman roads were covered with peat in places to a depth of eight feet, but one could hardly argue for an age of 48,000 years for them. It is still true, however, that elephant bones found under a few inches or feet of peat in America are dated in terms of many thousands of years.(Victoria Institute , 1866, 2:325). They could be very recent.
Other finds included datable metal objects found at great depths in peat beds. In Abbeville, France, a boat loaded with Roman bricks was found in the lowest tier of the peat. In the Somme Valley, beech stumps up to four feet in height were found covered by peat before they had decayed (Victoria Institute , 1877, 13:111-112).
Drop by drop the water that bears a trace of minerals trickles on the logs that had been buried in a storm. Millions of years pass. At long last the process is completed. Today tourists look in awe at the Petrified Forest in Arizona. Who can doubt the immense age of the earth? However, more than a century ago, in the 1860s, a scientist asked how one would account for the fact that wood had turned to stone without injury to the most delicate vegetable fibers. If long periods of



2020. 11. 09. Time Upside Down
https://www.creationism.org/books/vonfange/vonFangeTimeUpDownChap02.htm 6/6
time passed during the process of petrification, decay would destroy much of the structure long before. The same problem was noted in the case of fossilized sponges. The most delicate structures are perfectly preserved in flint. If petrification occurs at all under the right conditions, it happens very quickly (Victoria Institute , 1865, 1:327)
Counter to commonly held beliefs and textbook teaching, a scientist in 1947 noted that logs had petrified in less than one year (Andrew, 1947, p.19).
In the 1870s, Dr. Scheuermann discovered a number of sticks, apparently artifically pointed by the hand of man, that had been found in lignite. The lignite, however, was considered to predate man (Victoria Institute , 1875, 11:27).
We must grant the possibility here that wave or water action might have caused the sticks to appear sharpened. However, much more recently a surprising find was made in India. Small pieces of wood had been worked definitely by man before they had become fossilized (Anthropos , 6364 [1969] 921-940].
A number of cut fossil bones were discovered in various parts of Lombardy, Italy. Scientists who studied the finds determined that they had been produced by a cutting implement before they became fossilized. The fossils were dated from the Pliocene Epoch, that is, before the age of man. Some such finds preserved in the museum of Florence, Italy, along with implements, are of so recent a type that a great mystery is evident, or some kind of 'contamination' must be assumed (Victoria Institute , 1877, 13:343; 1884, 20:89; 1894, 30:237).
Even more startling was the report of two fossil dinosaur bones distinctly scored at regular intervals by cuts, such as might be produced by a flint knife. If the bones had been of a modern species along with such implements, there would be no question but that they were of human workmanship. The bones, however, were from a Jurassic deposit, however, so the evidence was not acceptible to scientists. (See I). There is the possibility that the scoring occurred from some natural cause (Victoria Institute 23:211-213).
The diatomite fossil beds in Santa Barbara County, California, furnish striking evidence of a sudden catastrophe. Fish fossils are heavily matted together in foot-thick layers so well preserved they retain a fish odor when a fragment is broken. There are many indications that the fish were suddenly trapped. The fossils show wide open gasping mouths, fins widely spread, back fiercely arched, body twisted, and head back. Many fossil fish are partly on end through bedding planes of the rock which led to the observation that the heads and tails are millions of years apart according to conventional dating (CRSQ 6:3, p. 129-135).
Many lines of evidence are brought together here to show that textbook time simply does not apply to the real world. Surtsey Island sprang up over night, and this mature-looking island is an excellent example of how quickly things can happen. Mountains and deserts can be very young indeed. Stalagmites and other kinds of rock form quickly, and there is good evidence that if fossils form at all, they form rapidly under the right conditions. Peat also develops much faster than formerly thought. When we look closely at the things around us which,appear to be of a great age, we find that the evidence points consistently toward a young earth.

TIME UPSIDE DOWN Chapter 3 By Erich von Fange

Upside Down Formations That Can't Be
Over the past century, scientists have speculated that life began with a one-celled creature and that over enormous spans of time more complex creatures evolved. Thus they have charted a kind of family tree of life as they believe it evolved. This means that simple creatures ought to be found in the lowest or oldest layers of the earth, while the more complex organisms ought to be higher up in the strata. The theory fails to explain why one-celled organisms still exist today since presumably they have now had about 4.5 billion years to get on with evolving to better things.
This succession from simple to complex in the layers of the earth is then used to date each layer according to the time scale developed and frequently amended during the past 150 years.
If exceptions are found in the layers of the earth, that is, if simple (older) creatures are found deposited above complex (younger) creatures, scientists normally explain such finds as 'overthrusts.' An overthrust occurs when portions of the earth are pushed upward to form hills and mountains. Such layers may then come to rest on top of younger layers. No one would deny that overthrusts do in fact occur. Serious questions are raised, however, when enormous areas are found to have fossils in the 'wrong' order and there is no evidence whatsoever that overthrusts occurred. Some examples follow where something other than an explanation of overthrusts is called for.
When Precambrian strata seem to be deposited by water on top of Cretaceous formations, billions of years of rock are resting in the wrong place. Field work carried out in 1968 resulted in the above conclusion. This geologic puzzle is the Lewis Overthrust, which extends from Glacier National Park 350 miles into Alberta, Canada, in a strip 15-30 miles wide. This phenomenon is cited in the texts as the classic example of a large overthrust, that is, older rock pushed up and out over younger rock. The fossils are in the wrong order. The problem of applying the overthrust theory here is the vast extent of the 'wrong order' formation (CRSQ , 1969, 6:2, P.96).
A mystery occurs in the Franklin Mountains near El Paso, Texas, at a location known as West Crazy Cat Canyon. Here we find massive Upper Ordovician limestones lying immediately on top of an Upper Cretaceous formation. A geologist who conducted a tour there a few years ago explained that no actual physical evidence had yet been discovered of an overthrust, but since the fossils were completely out of order, geologists assumed an overthrust (CRSQ , ;1966, 3:1, p.59).



2020. 11. 09. Upside Down Formations That Can't Be
https://www.creationism.org/books/vonfange/vonFangeTimeUpDownChap03.htm 2/4
Another famous location is the Glarus Overthrust near Schwanden, Switzerland. Instead of the textbook order of Permian, Jurassic, and Eocene, a 21-mile overthrust is assumed because the order of formations is Eocene at the bottom, Jurassic next and Permian on top. A so-called gouge layer shows no striations, and even the irregularities at the bottom of each formation have not been worn away. Again the fossils clearly are in the wrong places (CRSQ , 1971, 8:4, p.251-255). Some argue that the formations were overturned, but again the extent of overturn involved seems to raise extreme problems.
In the Empire Mountains in southern Arizona, Permian limestone rests on top of Cretaceous. The contact resembles gear meshing. There could have been no sliding without the projections of the lower formation being ground off. Yet it is called an overthrust. Fossils are in the wrong order in Heart Mountain, Wyoming, and in nearby Sheep Mountain. These mountains are capped with Paleozoic limestone. Lower down are Jurassic and Tertiary sediments. Below these Paleozoic limestone again appears (CRSQ , 1964, 1:4, P.44-45).

An impossible combination of fossils was reported found in 1970 in Guryul Ravine, Kashmir. Permian brachiopods were found mixed with lower Triassic pelecypods. Since the one is supposed to have become extinct long before the other evolved, no explanation of the puzzle was offered (CRSQ , 7:2, p.122).
In the past decade, studies of plant spores have been made in the formations of the Grand Canyon. Spores of the conifer were found in the Permian, Mississippian, Cambrian and Precambrian, and pollen of flowering plants were also found in the Precambrian. No evolutionary theory can accommodate these findings(CRSQ 1972, 9:1, p.25; l966, 3:1, p.49; l972, 9:4, p.238).
Sometimes appearances can be very deceiving. In 1948 a startling observation was made at Mount Vesuvius. It was found that blocks of limestone enveloped in molten lava at Vesuvius have, by the absorption of silicates, developed into forms that are similar to Precambrian rock, for example, those found by Dawson in Canada (Victoria Institute , 1948, 80:25).

Vesuvius - limestone transformed
One text writer stated that some of the strata described above could scarcely be supposed to have been inverted if it had not been for a study of the fossils in them. He also said that had these sections been planned for the purpose of deception, they could not have been more skillfully devised (CRSQ , 1964, 1:4, p.44). Derek Ager (1973), an evolutionist and respected geologist, has some astonishing things to say to his colleagues about the nature of the earth layers (stratigraphy). He is ready to consider catastrophic events on the earth caused by extraterrestrial forces, such as erratic comets or planets; he discards the notion that the past is measured only in terms of present forces, such as weathering. This last item has been an almost sacred doctrine of evolutionists for the past l50 years. Ager discards the notion as only an illusion that continuous sedimentation builds up over vast stretches of time; changes do not take place gradually; and fossils, he admits, are dated by means of circular reasoning. Ager remains loyal to evolution, but his observations are devastating to almost everything taught even today in conventional geology textbooks.
It is evident that the neat charts and diagrams found in textbooks do not describe the actual world. The succession of fossils from lower to higher strata does not correspond to published charts. The overthrust explanation is not valid for many geological 'wrong-order' formations. Fossils and rock strata are dated by means of a most curious circular line of reasoning. For example, this fossil is 100 million years old (an unverified statement) and therefore any rock that contains this fossil is 100 million years old. The rocks are dated by the fossils they contain. The fossils are dated according to the rock they are in, but the rock has been identified first according to its fossils. Yet as examples show, fossils are found in impossible situations where no evolutionary explanation can apply.

Bristlecone Pines Tell on C14
Certain discovered truths are held to be beyond any question or doubt. Among these of course are the constants of absolute zero, the speed of light, and the decay of radioactive materials. Certainly nothing in today's newspapers and textbooks give any hint that these are not sacred truths to be completely accepted. One of the first suggestions that the decay of radioactive material as a constant might be in trouble appeared in a news magazine as early as1964, when a group of physicists reported that they had proved that they could influence the rate of radioactive decay. Yet radioactive dating methods stand or fall on the assumption that the rate is a constant. Some geologists question the use of the C14 method for samples stored under moist conditions. This is a most serious limitation, for who can be sure that moisture has never come into contact with a given sample (Time , 6/19/1964, p.74: Faul, 1954, p.258, 352)?
More trouble appeared several years ago with studies of bristlecone pine borings. These trees are considered by most scientists as the oldest living matter known on earth. However, C14 tests made with wood from these pines of at least approximately known age showed that C14 readings were in error from a few centuries up to a thousand years. This find cast further doubt on the assumptions of the method (The Reader's Digest , 12/1972, p.86-90).
C14 was originally calibrated with supposedly known dates of material from ancient Egyptian tombs. Egyptian chronology, however, is not as secure as we have been led to believe. Some decades later it was again recalibrated, this time with the California bristlecone pines. But these 'repairs' for the method only brought new problems for the use of C14 in dating. We note a few of such difficulties below.
Dr. Libby, the discoverer of the C14 method, which won for him a Nobel prize, expressed his shock that human artifacts extended back only 5000 years, a finding totally in conflict with any evolutionary concept. Older dates were found to be very unreliable (CRSQ , 1972, 9:3, p.157).
By this time tens of thousands of C14 dates have been published from tests performed by various laboratories around the world. In the annual volumes in which the dates are published, concerns have been expressed about many relatively young dates that violate established geological age notions. One example given was Ice-Age materials that were dated by C14 to fall within the Christian era (CRSQ , 1969, 6:2, p.114). In his book on prehistoric America, Ceram notes a classic case of the difficulties that befall C14 dating. Bones 30,000 years old were found lying above wood dated at 16,000 years (Ceram, 1971, p.257-259).

https://www.creationism.org/books/vonfange/vonFangeTimeUpDownChap04.htm 2/4
Another classic C14 problem was noted for Jarmo, a prehistoric village in northern Iraq. Eleven samples were dated from the various strata and showed a 6000-year spread from oldest to most recent. Analysis of all the archaeological evidence, however, showed that the village was occupied no more than 500 years before it was finally abandoned (Custance, 1968, Mortar samples can be given normal C14 tests since mortar absorbs carbon dioxide from the air. Mortar, however, from Oxford Castle in England gave an age of 7,270 years. The castle was built about 800 years ago. The kind of contamination is unclear. Living trees near an airport were dated with C14 as l0,000 years old, because the wood contained contamination from plane exhaust (CRSQ , 1970, 7:2, p.126; 1965, 2:4, p.31). p.19).
C14 analysis of oil from Gulf of Mexico deposits showed an age measured in thousands of years - not millions. Data produced by the Petroleum Institute at Victoria, New Zealand, showed that petroleum deposits were formed 6,000-7,000 years ago. Textbooks state that petroleum formation took place about 300,000,000 years ago (Velikovsky, 1955, p.287; CRSQ , 1965, 2:4, p.10).
Fossil wood was found in an iron mine in Shefferville, Ontario, Canada, that was a Precambrian deposit. Later the wood was described as coming from Late Cretaceous rubble, which made it about 100 million years old instead of more than 600 million years old. Two independent C14 tests showed an age of about 4000 years (Pensee , Fall 1972, 2:3, p.43).
The last major glacial advance in America was long dated at about 25,000 years ago. C14 dates forced a revision down to 11,400 years. The United State Geological Survey carried out studies that gave a C14 date as recent as 3300 years ago, but no text treats such a puzzling find that falls well within historic times (Velikovsky, 1955, p.158-159; CRSQ , 1968, 5:2, p.67).
Here is a remarkable example of C14 difficulties in a book published by Stanford University Press. Six C14 ages were determined from a core in an attempt to date the formation of the Bering Land Bridge. The dates ranged from 4390 to 15,500 Before Present.
The first problem was that the results were so disarranged from bottom to top of the core that no two samples were in the correct order. Then the oldest date was discarded because it was 'inconsistent' with other tests elsewhere. Next the remaining dates were assumed to be contaminated by a fixed amount, after which the authors concluded that the delta under study had been formed 12,000 years ago (Hopkins, 1967, p.110-111). This is how 'truth' is manipulated and managed by evolutionists imprisoned by theoretical considerations. Even more astonishing is this cynical statement made at a symposium of Nobel Prize winners in Uppsala, Sweden, in 1969:



2020. 11. 09. Bristlecone Pines Tell on C14
https://www.creationism.org/books/vonfange/vonFangeTimeUpDownChap04.htm 3/4
If a C14 date supports our theories, we put it in the main text. If it does not entirely contradict them, we put it in a footnote. And if it is completely 'out of date,' we just drop it (Pensee , Winter 1973, p.44).
Other methods, for example, uranium-lead and thorium-lead ages, have been found to result in contradictory evidence. A classic example is that the dust samples on the surface of the moon seem to be older than the rocks underneath (CRSQ , 1971, 8:3, p.203).
The age of moon rocks reported in the press is not as clear cut as it appears. Dates acceptable to preconceived theory have been generally published. Much less is said about unacceptable dates found by means of potassium-argon dating, all the way from 7 to 20 billion years in age. Rather than question the method and the assumptions underlying the method, the bad samples are regarded as 'contaminated.' A geophysical research journal reported that lava which formed in the year 1800-1801 was tested by the potassium-argon dating method and showed an age of 160 million up to 3 billion years in age. Other reports have been published of similar dates for young rocks in Norway, Germany, France, and the Soviet Union (Journal of Geophysical Research , July, 1968; CRSQ, 1970, 7:3, p.145; Time , 10/3/1969, p.72-74). In the Canadian Arctic on a rock ledge on Victoria Island, researchers found a number of brachiopods and tracks in a Precambrian deposit. No such life was known to appear until the Cambrian period, however. Laboratory dating produced the impossibly young date of 445 million years (Ordovician Period). Presumably laboratory tests will continue until a reassuring date of more than 600 million years is secured (Time , 11/12/1965, p.160 plus 11/19/1965 letter to the editor).
The author of a text on nuclear geology admits that most of the time scales used in geology are based on the uncritical compilation of a wide variety of data, so that the overall figures are necessarily very rough (Paul, 1954, p.258, 352). Just how rough these figures are is the main point of this whole discussion.
Dr. Robert V. Gentry is the world's leading authority on radiohalo research. He has published a remarkable series of papers in such distinguished journals as Nature ,
Science , and Annual Review of Nuclear Science . His findings are of great significance to the question of radiometric dating. Among his carefully drawn conclusions are the following: Earth's primordial crustal rocks, rather than cooling and solidifying over millions or billions of years, crystallized almost instantaneously. Some geological formations thought to be 100 million years old are in reality only several thousand years old
(Research Communications Network Report , 2/10/1977, p.3).
The topic of radioactive decay in connection with dating suggests an interesting fact about another kind of decay in the world. In 1968, Time reported that we have only 2023 years to go. By 399l A.D. the earth's magnetic field may have disappeared. Here is what may happen (and these events have happened before on the earth): Catastrophic mutation of plant and animal life, widespread climatic changes, lush valleys becoming barren wastes, deserts blooming, icecaps growing and covering the land or melting and drowning coastal cities (Time , 3/15/1968, p.36-38).
For the past century and a half careful measurements of the earth's magnetic field have been conducted. The rapid decay of the magnetic field is startling. Assuming that this rate is constant, scientists are able to show mathematically how strong the magnetic field was in the distant past. Instead of an age in the millions or billions of years, however, the magnetic field can be projected back in time less than 20,000 years. The world could not exist with the powerful magnetic field projected beyond 20,000 years. This finding is strong evidence for a young earth (CRSQ , 1972, 9:1, p.47).
Standard texts say that the world experienced 171 magnetic reversals in the last 76 million years, that is, since Late Cretaceous times. The last reversal is said to have occurred 700,000 years ago, and the next event is long overdue. Some authorities say that the 171 reversals are nothing more than arbitrary interpretations of selectively chosen samples (Briggs, 1971, p.10; CRSQ , 1972, 9:1, p.47).



2020. 11. 09. Bristlecone Pines Tell on C14
https://www.creationism.org/books/vonfange/vonFangeTimeUpDownChap04.htm 4/4
But while geologists proclaim and debate such 'facts,' sophisticated research by archaeologists shows that there was a magnetic reversal as recently as the eighth century B.C. These studies were made with Etruscan pottery. The authors also note that polarity changes also bring about faunal extinctions, climatic changes, fantastic extent of volcanic activity, earthquakes, tidal waves, and other awesome phenomena (Nature , 227:930).
We all like to live in hope, and one of the best examples of hope is the hope scientists have that some day radiometric dating will become a very precise tool. We can agree that this would be most interesting and helpful. The examples above show, however, that there are a great many serious problems with the method and especially with the assumptions underlying the method. In some carefully defined situations, C14 dating appears to be of value, and research must continue to determine the limits of its valid use. Whether we are talking about the astonishingly rapid decay of the earth's magnetic field or about radiometric dating that focuses on various decay rates, there is no reason to believe that the earth is an old one.

Odd Things in Wrong Places.
As man digs and scrapes and drills into the mysterious earth, many surprising finds are made. It follows that mining and farming have been fruitful sources of curious finds in the past. We can feel strong regrets that as both occupations have become more and more mechanized, fewer and fewer finds of value for scientific study will occur. The following interesting items make two important points. If conventional dating is followed, ancient man seems to be far more ancient than he should be. In fact, he must have been thriving before he is supposed to have evolved. Second, ancient man was a very sophisticated person. There is no indication that his brain gradually evolved. Both of these conclusions, obviously, are completely opposite to evolutionary theory.
One of the most prodigious lava flow in the history of the world occurred in the Pacific Northwest. The lava spread over an estimated 200,000 square miles in depths up to 5,000 feet. In 1972, a competent geologist stated that the eruptions took place a mere fifteen million years ago. Much of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and portions of neighboring states, was covered. The immense age of the deposit can easily be imagined by the fact that the Snake River has cut canyons through the deposit to depths of up to 3000 feet.
Still, there are several curious things about this lava flow. Many competent observers have commented on the remarkable freshness of the deposit, as though the eruptions took place in very recent times. A startling find was made in 1889 near Nampa, Idaho. While workers were boring an artesian well, a small figurine of baked clay was extracted from a depth of 320 feet. Above the figurine, the drill, inside a 6-inch tubing, had cut through fifteen feet of basalt lava and many other strata. The find has never been challenged except to say that it was impossible. The conclusion is unmistakable. Before the basalt flowed, sophisticated humans lived in the area (Velikovsky, 1955, p.87; Pensee , May 1972, 2:2, p.18). Ancient men lived in California. They worked the hardest stones, fabricated perfect granite mortars and dishes, used a circular, skilletlike vessel made of lava, hard as iron, which had three legs and a spout, made polished stone axes with perfect holes drilled in them for a handle, and fashioned ladles, disks or quoits. They were able to bore into the bowels of mountains for gold and silver.

One ancient shaft was drilled 210 feet down into solid rock. An altar for worship was found there. Other finds include the following: a mortar for grinding gold ore at a depth of 300 feet in a mining tunnel, a mortar and pestle weighing 30 pounds, beads, perforated stones, a 40-pound oval granite dish. One human skull was found at a depth of 130 feet under five beds of lava and tufa separated by layers of gravel. Man came before the lava flowed, and deep canyons have been cut by rivers since the lava spread. An amazing number of stone relics have been found. The finding are almost always in gold-bearing rock or gravels (Victoria Institute , 1879, 15:193-198).
A California newspaper reported the find of an elaborately carved rock and other worked stones weighing up to 800 pounds which had been found in hydraulic operations hundreds of feet underground. The original site was an ancient river bed dated long before the last Ice Age (Edward, 1964, p.109).
Nothing describes what has been discovered in California quite as well as Job 28 (TEV). Similar locations have been studied in many parts of the world. Read this detailed and sophisticated memory of what mining in ancient times was like.
Far from where anyone lives or human feet ever travel, men dig the shafts of mines. There they work in loneliness, clinging to ropes in the pits. There are mines where silver is dug. There are places where gold is refined. Men dig iron out of the ground and melt copper out of the stones. Men explore the deepest darkness. They search the depths of the earth and dig for rocks in the darkness. Food grows out of the earth, but underneath the same earth all is torn up and crushed. The stones of the earth contain sapphires, and the dust contains gold. No hawk sees the roads to the mines, and no vulture ever flies over them. No lion or other fierce beast ever travels those lonely roads. Men dig the hardest rocks, dig mountains away at their base. As they tunnel through the rock, they discover precious stones. They dig to the sources of rivers and bring to light what is hidden. The value of wisdom is more than coral, or crystal, or rubies, or the finest topaz and the purest gold.
In the museum at Moses Lake, Washington, are some very crude scrapers on exhibit which were found under a glacial morain. This would appear to date man in Washington to a time before the Pleistocene epoch, which scientists are reluctant to do. A similar discovery was made near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Crude choppers and scrapers of quartzite were found deep in the earth and had been tumbled and mixed in glacial till. Again this is evidence that man lived there before the glacial advance. Scientists do not want to put man in America that long ago (Folsom, 1971, p.70; p.184). Such finds are no problem for creationists who see no conflict for such finds within a biblical time framework.

A strange account comes from the little village of Plateau City, Colorado, a short distance east of Grand Junction. A resident was digging a cellar in 1936. At a depth of ten feet he found paved tile laid in some kind of mortar, different from any other construction in the valley. While the tiles are dated anywhere from 20,000 to 80,000 years old, they lie in a Miocene formation, which could make it up to 25,000,000 years old by conventional dating (Edward, 1962, p.100-101).
In 1871 near Chillicothe, Illinois, well drillers brought up a bronze coin from a depth of 114 feet. This remarkable discovery was described in the Proceedings of the American Philosophic Society . This is additional evidence that man had been present there. Rapid change of the terrain is also indicated (Edwards, 1962, p.101).
Heizer notes a number of impossibilities according to commonly accepted geological dating: a hyena tooth sawed by a flint before it became fossilized, cutting operations on the fossilized bone of an extinct rhinoceros and on other animals at a site near Paris, and evidence of the use of a sharp tool on the horn of fossilized rhino remains in Ireland. Under the surface of the North Sea the trunk of an oak was removed from a long submerged forest. The trunk showed the marks of a hatchet on it. (Heizer, 1962, p.107-114).
Should "age" depend on where you find it?
Conventional theory has early hunters migrating from Asia to America. One of the best known early projectile points is the Folsom point, and the identical pattern is found both in China and over much of America. It is of particular interest that this point is dated as early as 10,000 B.C. in America, but no earlier than 2000 B.C. in China (Mertz, 1972, p.99). Theory, however, requires the points in China to be older.
Conventional dating places the formation of many coal deposits at about 300,000,000 years ago. Other coal formation took place in Tertiary times. Man, of course, according to evolutionary theory did not 'emerge' until several million years ago. From time to time, some very odd things have been reported in coal. Modern methods of coal mining make other similar finds unlikely today. The following reports have stirred considerable question and debate:
In 1885 at a foundry belonging to Isidor Braun of Vocklabruck, Austria, a block of coal was broken up. Out of it fell a small iron or steel cube with a deep incision around it and with the edges rounded on two faces. Some who examined it concluded that only human hands could have made the object. The son of the owner later took it to the Linz Museum in Austria, but later it was lost. A cast of the cube, however, is still kept by the museum.
The debate was never closed. One authority in 1886 held it to be an iron meteorite. Unfortunately there is no longer a way to verify that the object was actually encased in brown coal. Some hold that it is merely a cast iron object which may have originated in the foundry where it was discovered (Thomas, 1971, p.28-29).
In 1912, some coal mined near Wilburton, Oklahoma, revealed a mystery which has still not been solved. Two employees of the Municipal Electric Plant, Thomas, Oklahoma, came upon a solid chunk of coal too large for the furnace. They broke it up with a sledge. An iron pot fell from the center where it had left an impression or mold in the piece of coal. An affidavit was made out by the two witnesses, and the pot was photographed. Many persons examined this strange object.

https://www.creationism.org/books/vonfange/vonFangeTimeUpDownChap05.htm 4/4
After the exhibitor died, the pot was disposed of in some way and is now lost.
The proceedings of a society of antiquities, Scotland, reported a similar strange discovery. An iron instrument had been found in the heart of a piece of coal from a mine in Scotland. The instrument was considered to be modern, but there was no sign of boring in the piece of coal.
Some years ago Henry Morris reported that he had interviewed a coal miner in West Virginia who had excavated a perfectly formed human leg turned into coal. Years before in the same general area another party of miners unearthed a well-constructed concrete building. Not enough information exists to evaluate these supposed finds (CRSQ , 1970, 7:4, p.201; 1968, 5:4, p.147; Fort, 1941, p.127-128).
In the collection of the Freiberg Mining Academy, Germany, was an object supposed to be a fossilized human skull in brown coal, first described in 1842, before Darwin's book on the origin of species. The specific source of the 'skull' is unknown. While the object is frequently labeled as a fake, the early date of its description is in its favor. A scientist in Germany referred to it as a puzzling human skull a few decades ago. The matter is still an open question, but the problem is that it was found in a formation too old for it by conventional dating assumptions (CRSQ , 1968, 5:4, p.132).
Other strange things have been reported found in rocks. For example, a nail was reported by David Brewster in a sandstone block from the Mesozoic Era. Another report indicates that it was discovered in Old Red Sandstone of Devonian age. In a report of the British Association, 1845-1851, it was stated that a nail was found in a block of stone from the Kingoodie Quarry, Scotland. The block was nine inches thick and came from below the surface. The point of the nail projected into some till and was quite eaten with rust, but the last inch, including the head, was embedded in the stone (Charroux, 1970, p.181); Fort, 1941, p.131).
Workmen quarrying rock near Tweed below Rutherford Mills discovered a gold thread embedded in stone at a depth of eight feet. A piece of this object was sent to the office of the Kelso Chronicle in that district (Fort, 1941, p.130).
A report was carried in Scientific American that in June, 1851, workmen were blasting near Dorchester, Massachusetts. Cast out from a bed of solid rock was a bell-shaped metal vessel. A photo of the vessel, with inlaid floral designs in silver, showed a remarkably high degree of craftsmanship (Fort, 1941, p.128). In the sixteenth century, Spanish conquistadors came across an iron nail about six inches long solidly encrusted in rock in a Peruvian mine. The rock was estimated to be tens of thousands of years old. Iron was unknown to the Indians there. The Spanish Viceroy kept the mysterious nail in his study as a souvenir, and the account of this find was recorded by letter in the Madrid Archives, 1572. Another odd report in the London Times , 1851, stated that Hiram de Witt found a piece of gold-bearing quartz in California. When it was accidentally dropped, an iron nail with a perfect head was found inside (Thomas, 1971, p.29).
Many of these curious reports cannot be verified to our satisfaction today. The reports seem to this observer, however, to be too varied and widespread to be nothing but hoaxes. In this section again, we see many reasons to respect the sophistication of men who lived long ago. The concept of a young earth here too fits well with the kind of finds that have been made.

Extinct Llamas and Elephants - Village Pets
According to conventional theory, the camel family appeared on the scene in Eocene times, and then underwent rapid changes. By Oligocene times (26-38 million years ago) the feet were two-toed, the other three toes having completely disappeared. Also in the camel family are the llamas which have two toes, but at a very early stage of their evolution they had five (Colbert, 1955, p.386).
The Tiahuanacan empire in Bolivia predates the Incas. About 1920 an archaeologist was digging in the ruins of two coastal sites which belonged to this empire. Here he came upon pottery jugs with representations of llamas. The llamas had five toes, which seemed most strange, since by no stretch of the imagination could the Tiahuanacan civilization be made out to be that old. According to theory man evolved many millions of years after the last five-toed llama lived.
The mystery deepened when the same archaeologist discovered the skeletons of llamas at the sites, all with five toes (Honore, 1964, p.164-165).
The mastodon elephant arrived in America during the Miocene epoch, according to the texts, multiplied astonishingly, and then became extinct. Assorted explanations have been offered, including the theory that early hunters wiped them all out. Various dates, for example, 4500 B.C., are given when the last elephant in America died. A far more recent date is suggested by the following. Near Concordia, Columbia, a complete skeleton of a mastodon was found in an artificial salt pond, which had been constructed by Indians. The pond, with its bottom of paved stones together with the animal, had been entombed by a sudden landslide (Victoria Institute, 1886, 22:151).
Rock carvings of the mastodon was found in Hava Supai Canyon, Arizona, and were believed to date back to 10,000 B.C. In the same location, however, utensils were found made out of live, not fossil, ivory, which could lower the date considerably (Santesson, 1970, p.39).
In 1929 the skeleton of a mastodon was found in Ecuador. Evidently killed by Indians, a circle of fires had been built around the body for convenient roasting of the flesh. A landslide covered the site, which also included broken painted pottery and artifacts. This remarkable find was dated at the beginning of the Christian era (Scott, 1962, p.261).
In 1928 a Mayan workshop was uncovered in Central America. The archaeologist concluded that the owner of the shop, dated from the second to the fourth century A.D., must have kept a mastodon, perhaps even as a pet, for the bones of the animal were found among smashed bowls and jars (Wendt, 1956, p.524-525). One paleontologist believed that mammoths still lived in the interior of the American continent at the time of the first Spanish explorers. He supported his belief by the fact that such bones are found under a few inches of peat. Many accurate descriptions of the elephant have been collected from various Indian tribes in America and Canada (Scientific Monthly , 75 [Oct. 1952], 215-221).

David Ingram, an English adventurer, was put ashore with 113 other men between Mexico and Florida in 1568, and he wandered for years in the American interior before making his way to the east coast of the American colonies. In his report to the state secretary of Queen Elizabeth, he described precisely and drew accurate pictures of elephants as well as bison and other animals he and his companions had observed during the journey. Ingram could not have known that some centuries later, elephant bones (mastodons and mammoth) would be discovered all over the continent. This account is not taken seriously, but it is a curious fact that 200 years later President Jefferson was informed by a delegation of Indian chiefs that hunting in the interior lands included animals described as elephants. It is a matter of record that President Jefferson asked Lewis and Clark to be on the alert for elephant herds during their exploration of the West (Wendt, 1956, p.525-526).
The curious reports above fit in well with the concept of a young earth. There seems to be no need to invoke an old earth to explain any of the finds.

Footprints Tell Tales
Handprints and footprints have held a fascination since ancient times. Paintings and rock carvings of these representations are found in many parts of the world. On rare occasions footprints are found or uncovered in rock strata. For such prints to form in the first place, they must be rapidly covered or they will erode away from wind and water action. From time to time human prints have been reported in strange places. Understandably, paleontologists are not interested in considering the possibility of human prints in formations they believe to be older than the emergence of man.
One paleontologist warned his colleagues about the extraordinary forms that 'false' prints may take. He described a print found in Triassic rock. It appeared to be the fossilized leather sole of a shoe, about size 13, which showed a double line of sewed stitches, one line close to the outside edge and the other parallel at a distance of about a third of an inch. The edges of the sole were rounded off smoothly as if cut, and the right side of the heel seems to be more worn than the left (Victoria Institute , 1948, 80:21-22).
Another unusual find was reported in newspapers in 1968, but geologists had no comment about it. A sandal footprint of an adult and the footprints of a child were found embedded in strata right on top of trilobite fossils. This is a Cambrian deposit near Antelope Springs, Utah (See Table 1: Q). Photographs have been published of these finds, but more evaluation is needed.
This find must be classed as very inconclusive, tempting as it may appear (CRSQ, 1968, 5:3, p.97). In the American Journal of Science a number of references to footprints in rock strata are discussed and reproduced, such as the following: Human impressions were reported in various locations in South America, but details are lacking...Human footprints in a limestone slab in a paved area between a house and garden in New Harmony, Indiana...A rock outcrop extending for three miles in front of St. Louis, Missouri, one to 200 feet wide, was observed during low water stages. The large number of human footprints there were noted already by early French explorers. The prints are in crinoidal limestone. The prints are described as of a man standing erect with toes spread apart. They appeared strikingly natural with every muscular impression, and the swell of heel and toes. The print described was about 10 1/2 inches long. The observer contrasted these prints with obviously carved footprints he had observed elsewhere...Other prints were reported in a quarry at Herculaneum, Missouri, and on rocks near Kingston, New York (CRSQ , 1970, 7:4, p.205).
Footprints up to twenty inches long were found in sandstone near Carson City, Nevada. Some of the larger prints are very clear and well-defined and were reproduced in the American Journal of Science . While some argue that the prints were of humans, they were later identified as the prints of the giant sloth (Fort, 1941, p.159; Wendt, 1956, p.519-520).
The State Geologist of Kentucky performed extensive tests on footprints found near Berea. The prints were discovered when the overburden from a sandstone formation was removed in logging

operations about 1930. One series of prints found included some arranged in a normal walking stride. Microscopic studies showed that the grain counts were greater in the soles than in the adjacent sandstone, showing greater compression within the print areas.
Distinct left and right foot impressions were found, each with five toes and with a distinct arch. The prints could not have been carved since some of the tracks were still partly covered by higher sandstone strata. Other prints have been reported in nearby areas, but further information is lacking (CRSQ , 1970, 7:4, p.207). A shoeprint was discovered in a coal seam in Fisher Canyon, Pershing County, Nevada. The imprint of the sole is so clear that traces of sewed thread are visible. The age of the coal is estimated to be more than 15,000,000 years (Thomas, 1971, p.24).
Close by a lake near Managua, Nicaragua are perhaps the most famous footprints in the Americas. They lie under eleven strata of solid rock from 16-24 feet under the surface. Heated debate about the age of the prints has gone on for almost a century. Initially they were dated about 200,000 years old, but since the feet were perfectly modern the age was reduced to older than 50,000 years. The only geologist to visit the scene at the initial discovery also found traces of domesticated dogs and horses with the prints - an impossible situation to resolve.
Polished stone artifacts and projectile points were also discovered. The prints are now dated at about 3000 B.C. on the basis of C14 tests, but this forces a considerable number of catastrophic events in a very short time period. Since various fossilized animal bones and mastodon remains have been found in strata above the human prints, the conclusion then is forced that the mastodon lived into very recent times. Near the city of San Raphael other human and animal tracks were found, including a sandal print which is now in the museum at Harvard (Victoria Institute , 1886, 22:148-152; Archaeology , 26 [April 1973], 146-147).
Near Glen Rose, Texas, the river bed of the Paluxy river is still revealing the astonishing sight of what apparently is human and dinosaur tracks together in stone. The rock formation is the Cretaceous. In 1970, James Ryals, who had been cutting out tracks and selling them since the 1930s, was interviewed. He reported the human tracks as mostly barefooted, but sometimes encased in some form of wrapping. The stride varied from two to seven feet. There are human tracks crossing dinosaur tracks, and dinosaur tracks which have blotted out human tracks in sequence.



2020. 11. 09. Footprints Tell Tales
https://www.creationism.org/books/vonfange/vonFangeTimeUpDownChap07.htm 3/3
Excavation of tracks show a compressed layer pattern underneath as one would expect if they are genuine. A scientist who did not examine the evidence ruled out the possibility that the tracks were human. A professor of medicine from the Unversity of Illinois examined the tracks and was convinced that they were genuine (CRSQ , 1970, 7:3, p.142; 1970, 7:4, p.246; Ryals, undated). Some years later at least some of the supposed human tracks were definitely shown to be dinosaur tracks. In the past 20 years many additional discoveries have been made to add to the controversy. Many books and articles treat these finds, both for and against their authenticity.
We must say that reports of footprints call for the utmost caution. Many people are imaginative creatures and with a little effort they can see almost anything patterned in worn rocks. Some rocks erode in a curious manner which could leave depressions much like footprints. No one questions the dinosaur footprints, however. The topic is too fascinating to pass by. Perhaps new finds will clarify the situation.

What Ailed Old Neanderthal Man?
In 1912 the famous Piltdown skull was found in a gravel bed in southern England by Charles Dawson. It created a sensation since it clearly was a creature halfway between man and beast. Evolutionists were ecstatic.
While a few scientists were skeptical, it was accepted by scholarly opinion throughout the world. It is no exaggeration to say that one could fill a very large room with learned articles and books about Piltdown Man, including 500 doctoral dissertations! In 1953 - 41 years later - careful examination revealed the Piltdown Man to be a very crude forgery consisting of a recent human skull combined with the jawbone of a female orangutan, appropriately dyed with chemicals to give it the appearance of great age and slightly modified to fool the expert paleontologists of the British Museum.
The Piltdown hoax illustrates an eagerness to believe in anything that might help to support the theory of evolution. One can almost picture men in museums all over the world hurrying with gray paint and brushes to paint out that branch of the human tree on the day the hoax was exposed. The next day, Piltdown Man had never existed. All the supposed family trees in the textbooks before 1953 show how Piltdown Man fit into the great story of human evolution.
No orthodox expert would dare to propose a recent beginning of man which would correspond to the Biblical account. Although various authorities have pointed out that the variability found among human fossils is really no different from the amazing variability found among people today, little or nothing is made of this fact in the textbooks. White, middleclass scientists should not necessarily make themselves the model from which fossil bones are judged and compared (Custance, 1968, p.26-31).
In the business of studying human fossil remains, astonishingly different reconstructions have been made from casts of the same skull fragments. As someone has noted, the features of the ape or the philosopher may be constructed on the surface of the same skull (Time , 5/17/1973, p.75-76).
It is of more than passing interest in the consideration of fossil man than an anthropologist stated several decades ago that living style and habits, climate, and diet can influence the anatomical features of the skull to the point that experts may place such species into different genera. An additional factor of great significance is the physical degeneration and extraordinary physical variability that occurs among isolated inbred populations (CRSQ , 1968, 5:1, p.5-7).
It is not well known that when 'primitive' Java man was discovered in 1891, two other skulls were found in the same formation and of the same age which were no different from skulls of modern Australian aborigines. The news of the modern skulls found with Java man was not made public for twenty years because they were not what the man was looking for (CRSQ , 1964, 1:2, p.9).
In 1963 Dr. Leakey found a fossil, which he named Homo habilis , at the lowest level of strata where he was working. Homo habilis was much like modern man. The problem was that Homo habilis seemed to be much more advanced than fossil remains which had been found higher up in the strata. Since evolutionary theory



2020. 11. 09. What Ailed Old Neanderthal Man?
https://www.creationism.org/books/vonfange/vonFangeTimeUpDownChap08.htm 2/2
requires a sequence of primitive to more advanced, the find became very controversial. On occasions such as these, explanations become very creative but strained in order to cling to evolutionary theory. Dr. Leakey suggested that all anthropology works be rewritten. A widely accepted 'solution' was that Homo habilis and the more primitive creatures were contemporaries, and that the search would continue in still older strata for the ancestor of Homo habilis (CRSQ , 1966, 3:1, p.14). Hope springs eternal!
Neanderthal man is a story by itself. When the first discovery was made about 1856, science at last thought it now had the overwhelming evidence it needed to show the intermediate stage between man and ape. Texts today still faithfully illustrate this famous beetle-browed, bent-kneed, subhuman slob. There was only one apparent slight drawback. Its brain on the average was more than 13% larger than the brain of modern man. It was still considered, however, to be the perfect illustration of an important step in the evolutionary sequence of man. Neanderthal man was still cited as the most compelling proof of evolution just a few decades ago (Time , 6/21/1968, p.34).
The famous names of early evolutionary theory made much of Neanderthal man, and texts published today still reflect their views. Haeckel proposed to solve the world riddles once and for all with Neanderthal man. Lyell and Huxley pointed confidently to the Neanderthal skull as evidence that there had been a low-caste, half-human creature, intermediate between man and ape (de Santillana, 1969, p.71; Victoria Institute , 1866, 2:72).
It is interesting thatTime , May 17, 1971, proclaimed that the primitiveness of Neanderthal was unwarranted. Except for physical ailments, he could walk the streets today and be unrecognized. One writer commented that in later centuries historians may declare all of us insane, because the incredible blunder about Neanderthal man was not detected at once and was not refuted with adequate determination.
It is a tragic commentary on the scientific community that the following must be said. Back in 1872, Virchow, probably the greatest biologist of his day and the founder of medical pathology, cited evidence that the peculiarities of Neanderthal man were due not to a special place in the chain of evolution, but rather to a bad case of rickets. An authority reported in Nature , 1970, that every Neanderthal child's skull studied so far showed signs compatible with severe rickets.
Again back in 1872 another medical authority declared that Neanderthal skulls showed medical problems, and that similar skulls of modern man may be found in any medical school (CRSQ , 1968, 5:1, p.5-7; 1970, 7:4, p.232-233; 1964, 1:2, p.9). The obsession to 'prove' evolution with Neanderthal man was so overpowering that it took more than 100 years for the scientific community to face up to the obvious truth that Neanderthal man was fully human.
Hard work for the past 150 years has brought scientists no closer to finding the so-called 'missing link' between man and animal than when the search began. Every year or two another article appears in National Geographic with spectacular new discoveries about human evolution. Without exception they are without substance. The fossils are either fully human or fully apelike with nothing in between.
In the great eagerness to believe preconceived notions of what must have been, fraud and a great deal of humbug have been produced to fill the need.

Conclusion: How Good Is Science?
With all its great accomplishments, science has never been very good at reconstructing the past nor in forecasting the future. There is no need to stand in awe where the evidence is weak or non-existent. Honesty requires that theory and guesswork should be so labeled.
Many examples were given in this book which demolish various age concepts evolutionists have attached to the past history of the earth. While the Christian who accepts the Old Testament for what it says about origins and time has no real problem, it is important that Christians be able to witness to others in the language of science. Evidence speaks louder than emotion. If there are compelling reasons for accepting the concept of an ancient earth, the evidence (without the ridicule) should be brought forward for study. An old earth is a belief required to support the theory of evolution.
There does not seem to be any convincing evidence that we live on anything but a young earth. There are, however, countless mysteries in our world which no one can unscramble. We do not know how old the earth is, and this question is not really an important one.
As an alternative to the conventional geologic clock, the following model is offered for study, with quotations from NIV:
THE FIRST AGE: The void earth in the beginning. Gen. 1:2 Now the earth was formless and empty... The great separations: light from darkness; the waters from under and above the firmament; the dry land from the waters; the day from night.
THE SECOND AGE: The good earth, from the sixth day to the Fall of man. Gen. 1:31 And God saw all that He had made, and it was very good.
THE THIRD AGE: The cursed earth, from Adam to Noah. The ground was cursed, not yielding its strength; thorns and thistles; high technology; earth corrupt and filled with violence. Gen. 5:29 (Noah) will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the Lord has cursed.
THE FOURTH AGE: The flooded earth in the days of Noah. Genesis 6-9 The story of the Flood; Gen. 7:23 Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out...
THE FIFTH AGE: The divided earth from Noah to Abraham. The ice, the hoary frost, the frozen deep, Job 38:29-30; The mighty hunter; The plastic and watery Post-Flood world; mankind 'splattered' over the earth from Babel; Peleg - when the earth was divided.
THE SIXTH AGE: The plagued earth from Abraham to Hezekiah. Sodom and Gomorrah with widespread destruction and formation of the Dead Sea; the ten plagues in Egypt and the Exodus; the 'long day' of Joshua; mountains skipping like rams; the great earthquake; the backward sun dial of Hezekiah.
THE SEVENTH AGE: The modern earth, about 650 B.C. to the present. The rise of Greece, Rome, Japan, and so-called Western Civilization.
All of the ideas expressed in this book fit well into this model of the ages of the world since the creation - a young, created earth.
