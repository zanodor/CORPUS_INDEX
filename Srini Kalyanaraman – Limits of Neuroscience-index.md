Limits of Neuroscience
-- Failure of brain to learn ‘meaning’ of universal language word ātman
-- Corollary: brain fails to learn the the raison d’etre of life is for ātman
‘life principle’ to link with paramātman ‘cosmic principle’
-- Metaphor of the Cosmic dancer awakening consciousness

[quote]On the one hand, it might be desirable to integrate various language-related functions into this
network such as, for example, the pragmatic assignment of word meanings in context, the sensorimotor
embodiment of language, or the listener's assumption of a speaker's intention behind an utterance. On
the other hand, by making the core language module large, accounting for all potential language-related
functions, more or less the entire brain must be considered as a network for language processing, due to
the fact that language is a powerful tool that not only can name all kinds of objects and express and store
all kinds of thoughts, but also can evoke emotions and physiological responses, can support complex
social functions such as teaching, flirting, division of labor, and conflict management, and last not least,
can be used for complex logical reasoning...Roughly, the brain resources that complement the core
language system in a task-specific way can be described as a number of brain structures and networks
that are related to (1) motor representations, (2) sensory-related representations, (3) non-verbal memory
structures, (4) affective/emotional processing, (5) social cognition and theory of mind, (6) meaning in
context, and (7) cognitive control. [unquote]—Ingo Hertrich, 2020, The Margins of the Language

[quote]The entire review is focused on the normal language communication process in a
native spoken language without addressing particular issues such as sign language or
second language acquisition... the core language network as presented here should be
taken as a kind of working definition circumscribing a brain module for some
elementary language functions while “elementary” remains a more or less vague
attribute... The neocortex is characterized by a modular structure of primary sensory
and motor areas mapping input signals or motor commands onto neuronal structures in a
systematically organized and spatially coherent manner such as tonotopy, retinotopy, or
somatotopy... Historical (Broca-, Wernicke-like) models, mostly based on clinical
observations of prototypical aphasic symptoms, are small, simple, and largely bound to
the left hemisphere. By contrast, functional imaging studies investigating healthy
subjects largely show bilateral activations and a huge network that is partially active,
depending on different language tasks. [unquote]

[quote]The Core Language Network
Since the beginning of the twenty-first century the view of the functional neuroanatomy of language received
various important updates, motivated, among others, by Poeppel and Hickok (2004) addressing various issues
such as linguistic specificity, more fine-grained localization in the brain, and connectivity patterns.
Subsequently, various models have been established, comprising auditory, phonological, and lexical regions in
the temporal lobe, that are linked to Broca's area and premotor cortex in the frontal lobe via lexical ventral
pathways and articulatory-phonological-syntactic dorsal pathways (Hickok and Poeppel, 2007; Hickok,
2009; Poeppel et al., 2012; Bornkessel-Schlesewsky et al., 2015; Skeide and Friederici, 2016). The importance
of the dorsal connection has already been emphasized in historical language models (see, e.g., Geschwind,
1970), in a simplified manner as an “arcuate fasciculus” connecting “Broca's” and “Wernicke's” areas. More
detailed neuroanatomical connectivity studies showed that the arcuate fasciculus, concomitant with the superior
longitudinal fasciculus, has a complex structure that has heavily developed in human evolution, connecting
multiple target areas in frontal cortex with multiple target areas in temporal and parietal cortex (Thiebaut de
Schotten et al., 2012; Friederici, 2017; Pulvermüller, 2018). Regarding the language-relevant aspects of this
structure, so far no definite model has been worked out, and various alternative models are still under discussion
(Glasser and Rilling, 2008; Dick and Tremblay, 2012; Friederici, 2018).[unquote]

[quote]...language will be considered as a more or less disembodied (Mahon, 2015) abstract
modality with auditory word forms as its basic units that are linked to lexical-semantic
objects in the mental lexicon. At a sub-lexical level, these units are bound to a phonological
structure organized in features, phonemes, phonological gestures, and syllables. At the
supra-lexical level, lexical word forms are concatenated to phrases and sentences organized
by a system of morphological and syntactic rules. For the present purpose, thus, the core
language network will be restricted to largely left-lateralized cortical regions for word
forms, simple lexical-semantic mapping, phonological processing, and syntax as outlined
in Figure 1 (regions with numbers 1–5)...[unquote]

Regions). Not shown in this figure, but also relevant for language processing, are right-hemispheric areas (see
section Right-Hemisphere Homologues of Left-Dominant Language Areas), subcortical regions including the
basal ganglia (see section Basal Ganglia), cerebellum (see section Cerebellum), and thalamus (see section
Thalamus), and inner regions of the cortex comprising insula (see section Insula—Interface to the “Inner Being”)
and cingulate cortex (see section Mechanisms of Cognitive Control in the Frontal Lobe).

[quote]Deictic Language
An interesting phenomenon in language communication is the use of underspecified lexical
items such as spatial demonstratives, requiring contextual or additional non-language
information such as pointing gestures. In such cases, a common spatial reference system has
to be built up comprising, at the level of brain activity, right-hemispheric spatial processing
concomitant with activation of the mentalizing system including medial prefrontal cortex and
the temporoparietal junction (de Langavant et al., 2011; Peeters et al., 2017; Vanlangendonck
et al., 2018). An fMRI study with word-level time resolution during the perception of narrative
speech found spatial demonstratives to recruit dorsal parieto-frontal “where” pathways that are
also active in extra-linguistic visuospatial cognition and attentional orienting (Rocca et al.,
2020).[unquote] Note: deictic ‘relating to or denoting a word or expression whose meaning is
dependent on the context in which it is used (such as here, you, me, that one there, or next
Tuesday )’.

[quote] Interference of Speaker Characteristics and Speaker Identity With Language
Processing
...the nature of concepts and mental objects has to be considered (Mahon and Hickok, 2016),
as well as attempts to explain ongoing changes in the mental lexicon in terms of “exemplar”
theories assuming that concepts are represented as remembered category instances during
category learning (Murphy, 2016)... A particular speaker/listener effect is evoked when the
listener's own name is uttered by a familiar voice. A study on traumatic patients in vegetative
state or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome has shown that the subjects' brain responses to
such auditory stimulation yielded a high prognostic value for later recovery (Wang et al.,
2015). [unquote]
