# Index for Sumerian Words.pdf

The following words and definitions were culled from _The_Sumerians_ by Samuel Noah Kramer (1963), and _The_Treasures_of_Darkness_ by Thorkild Jacobsen (1976). I have made some interpretations in breaking down compound words which the above authors have defined. The EnglishSumerian section is primarily alphabetical in organization, but in some cases phrases are entered by what appeared to be the "main" English word in a Sumerian compound word. I've also added some words to the Sumerian-English section from _Myths_from_Mesopotamia_ by Stephanie Dalley (1989). This is not intended to be authoritative but was originally compiled when there were no online sumerian dictionaries or glossaries back in 1994.
There is a much more thorough dictionary being compiled by Adapa at the Twin Rivers Rising coven site at:

That site has been restored, and you may also be interested in John Halloran's Sumerian Language Page at: http://www.sumerian.org
