Resources to document proclamation of decipherment of Indus Script hieroglyphs, hypertexts; inscriptions with signs, field symbols of Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization
-- Field symbols (#99), Text signs (#419 -- ASI 1977 I Mahadevan Concordance; Unicode fonts, #1839 -- Parpola Concordance)
Decipherment of Indus Script Inscriptions involves a documentation of the Writing System Cipher which renders in Meluhha spoken forms of Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization meanings of both the field symbols and text signs of the Corpora of (8000+ inscriptions as of August 2020).
Such a decipherment constitutes the framework to unravel the contributions made by artisans and seafaring merchants of Meluhha to create the wealth of nations from ca. 3300 BCE (Date of the first inscription on a potsherd discovered by HARP from Harappa) in the era of TinBronze Revolution (from ca. 7th m. BCE).

HOW TO USE THE INDUS SCRIPT FONT
For using specific sign of Indus Script font in word document, please follow these instructions:
1. Install NFM Indus Script font. Download



22
2. Find the value code of the required sign from table; vertical value & horizontal number: (For
example the sign has value E07 horizontal and 5 number in vertical. So the value code will be E075.) 3. Just type this code and then press Alt+X, without space. 4. A rectangle symbol will appear. Just select that rectangle symbol. 5. In formatting toolbar, select “NFM Indus Script” font. Required sign of Indus Script will appear at document in text format.

A free Indus script font package in scalable vector graphics for use in Word and other programs is now available. 1,839 signs represent the best Indus concordance by the longtime scholar Dr. Asko Parpola. It was engineered by the National Fund for Mohenjodaro in Pakistan, a Government of Sindh project.
"Leafing through the hundreds of signs made available by the laudable work of Shabir Kumbhar, Amar Fayaz Buriro and Dr. Kaleemullah Lashari, one is struck by there being so many signs of people. They are doing, acting, standing, posing, identifying, carrying, merging, trading; craftsmen, priests, scribes, rulers, clan leaders, people of endless places and occupations playing their part in a vast system of meaning and manufacture at the dawn of civilization.Go to font packages at the National Fund for Mohenjodaro A video is available from YouTube, 25 minutes of letters falling on to screens to a soft electronic melody." https://www.harappa.com/blog/free-complete-indus-font-package-available

ABOUT INDUS SCRIPT FONT
The Indus signs have been under constant analysis and study. These have been subjected to various examinations where these were identified as primary and composite signs. Asko Parpola has made a continuing contribution to research on the Indus writing system. He collected and critically edited the Indus signs as he attempted at structural analysis. His



24
objectives were to find out the number of graphemes, and the word length. His search for primary signs and identifying composite signs resulted in preparation of the sign list of the Indus script, with principal graphic/orthograhic variants, each with one reference.
The Indus signs have been largely used as drawing images in computational analysis and studies. Present effort is to create the Indus signs in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) based font for installing in computers.
National fund for Mohenjodaro has developed this font for installing on computers and embedding on websites by researchers and users around the world. This font is developed by Mr. Shabir Kumbhar, engineering / embedded and mapping by Mr. Amar Fayaz Buriro with the consultation of Dr. Kaleemullah Lashari and Mr. Manzoor Ahmed Kanasro (DG Antiquities & Archaeology, Government of Sindh).
Indus Script font is available to be downloaded for further studies, computational exercises and statistical analysis, free of charge; the only encumbrance is that user acknowledge our website. [unquote]

A major online resource to identify the spoken forms of Meluhha speech is a Comparative Indian Lexicon of over 25 + Ancient languages of India: "1 Indian Lexicon: An introduction Discovering the language of India circa 3000 B.C. This is a comparative study of lexemes of all the languages of India (which may also be referred to, in a geographical/historical phrase, as the Indian linguistic area). This lexicon seeks to establish a semantic concordance, across the languages or numraire facile of the Indian linguistic area: from Brahui to Santali to Bengali, from Kashmiri to Mundarica to Sinhalese, from Marathi to Hindi to Nepali, from Sindhi or Punjabi or Urdu to Tamil. A semantic structure binds the languages of India, which may have diverged morphologically or phonologically as evidenced in the oral tradition of Vedic texts, or epigraphy, literary works or lexicons of the historical periods. This lexicon, therefore, goes beyond, the commonly held belief of an Indo-European language and is anchored on proto-Indian sememes. The work covers over 8,000 semantic clusters which span and bind the Indian languages. The basic finding is that thousands of terms of the Vedas, the Munda languages (e.g., Santali, Mundarica, Sora), the so-called Dravidian languages and



50
the so-called Indo-Aryan languages have common roots. This belies the received wisdom of cleavage between, for example, the Dravidian or Munda and the Aryan languages. The lexicon seeks to establish an areal 'Indian' language type, by establishing semantic concordance among the so-called Indo-Aryan, Dravidian and Munda languages. The area spanned is a geographical region bounded by the Indian ocean on the south and the mountain ranges which insulate it from other regions of the Asian continent on the north, east and west. This lexicon is a tribute to the brilliant work done by etymologists and scholars of Indian linguistics, and to a number of scholars who have contributed to unravelling the enigma of the Indus (Sarasvati-Sindhu) Script and to the study of ancient Indian science and technology." https://www.academia.edu/37229973/Indian_Lexicon_Comparative_dictionary_of_over_800 0_semantic_clusters_in_25_ancient_Bharatiya_languages
For example, the Indus Script Sign of a spoked wheel which is depicted on two cire perdue bronze artifacts of Mehrgarh datd to 6th millennium BCE is signified by the Sign. This sign appears on Dholavira Signboard:
