RESPECTFULLY DEDICATE THIS VOLUME.

PREFACE
THE writer's object in preparing this book has been to give, in a single volume, a concise account of the excavations and discoveries made in Babylonia, Assyria, Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, in so far as they throw light on the pages of the Old Testament, and to enable the reader to form some estimate of the inferences which may be legitimately drawn from them. Their great value and importance is matter of common knowledge; but there has undoubtedly been a tendency in some quarters to base upon the inscriptions inferences and theories which they do not support, and to draw far-reaching conclusions for which there is no justification. It has been the writer's endeavour to allow the facts, as far as possible, to speak for themselves; he has thus, as a rule, merely pointed out such inferences as follow from them directly, without either entering upon the discussion of controverted points, or adopting theories which are too conjectural to merit serious consideration. He has only from time to time, where it appeared to be necessary, allowed himself to criticize briefly theories, or conclusions, which have lately been put forward, but which appear to him to rest upon insufficient data. He desires to record his obligations to the Trustees of the British Museum for kindly allowing him to reproduce many of the monuments and inscriptions in their charge, and to Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge, the keeper of the Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities in the British Museum, who has encouraged the work throughout, He is indebted to the Palestine Exploration Fund, the Egypt Exploration Fund, the Harvard Th,:,,/ogical Journal, the University of Chicago Press, the Dmtsch,·r OrimtGesellschaft, Mr. John Murray, and Mr. Mansell, for kindly permitting him to reproduce photographs in their possession.

PREFACE
It would be impossible here to enumerate the scholars to whose works the writer has been indebted in the preparation of this work; but the footnotes (necessarily few) give some indication as to the authorities consulled. He desires, however, to take this opportunity of acknowledging
his obligations to the great pioneering work of Dr. C. J.
Ball, Light fi-om the East, which contains a vast amount of information derived from Egyptian, Babylonian, and .\ssyrian sources, together with a large number of original translations ; and also to the standard works of Professor
Maspero (i. The Dawn of Ci7!ilization, ii. Stniggle of the 1\7i1tions, iii. The Passing qf the Empires), to which the writer is indebted both for much information, and also for a considerable number of illustrations. In order to render the book more complete, two appendices are added, one giving a brief account of the North Phccnician Inscriptions, the other a summary account of the ciYi!ization of the Hittites in the light of recent research and excavations. In regard to the preparation of the latter, the writer desires to thank Mr. D. G. Hogarth, the Director of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and a leading authority on Hittite civilization, as well as an excavator in Hittite lands, for supplying him with information from time to time and offering him useful suggestions. At the end of the book there is an index of Old Testament Place-names, with references tc the passages in which they occur, and mention of the modern sites which correspond to them,
when the identification is either (a) certain, or (b) probable,
or (c) doubtful, or merely possible. Last, and most of all, the writer desires to acknowledge his great indebtedness and to record his most sincere thanks, to his former teacher, Professor S. R. Driver, who, in the midst of all his work, has found time to read the whole of this book in either MS. or proof, and to give him frequently, especially in the Index of Place-names, assistance and advice, to which the writer will largely attribute any measure of success which this volume may meet.

THE LATEST LIGHT
ON
BIBLE LANDS
CHAPTER I
BABYLONIA, THE NATIVE LAND OF ABRAHAM
T
HE excavations in Mesopotamia have a threefold interest to the student of the Old Testament: first, because Mesopotamia was the traditional home of Abraham, the father of the Hebrew race ; secondly, because Canaan was for centuries a dependency of Babylonia; and thirdly, because the peoples of both Israel and Judah were in later days carried thither into captivity. But before proceeding to discuss the yieldings of Babylonian and Assyrian excavations, and the light which they throw upon the history and religion of the Hebrews, it is well that we should have a clear idea of the country in which the civilization to which the Hebrews were the destined heirs, was born, and where it was developed. Mesopotamia, as its name discloses (" between the rivers"), is the country lying between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates; thus the physical character• istics of the two countries which were the centres of the earliest known civilizations in the world-the D



THE !,/\TEST LIGHT ON l311JLE LJ\NDS
Egyptian and the Babylonian-were in this respect similar. Both civilizations arose in river valleys-a circumstance which became a determining factor not only in the political history of both peoples, but also in the history of their religious beliefs and their theological conceptions. In both countries the rivers were not merely the chief means of transit and the highway of commerce, but they were the stay and staff of life, for the fertility of Egypt and Babylonia was attributable to their respective rivers, in a twofold sense : first, as being the sole means of irrigation in these more or less rainless countries ; and secondly, as the means of dispersing, at the time of the yearly inundation, the rich mu<l brought down from the upper reaches of the rivers over the parched and barren land. But Babylonia not merely owed her productivity to the Tigris and Euphrates, but even her very existence to them, for the Babylonian plain was the outcome of a gradual process of physical development by which the land was yearly augmented at the expense of the sea. This change was effected by the silt brought down by the two rivers and deposited at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, which thus receded before the advance of its conquering assailant. The rate of progress at which the land had thus been annually encroaching upon the sea, may be correctly gauged for the last two thousand years or so, thanks to our knowledge of the fact that the town of Spasinus Chorax, the modern Mohammerah founded by Alexander the Great, lay, at the time of its foundation, upon the shores of the Persian Gulf. To-day it is situated some forty-seven miles inland-in short, during the past 2200 odd years, the



BABYLONIA, THE NATIVE LAND OF J\IIRAHA\f 3
land has reclaimed some forty-seven miles from the sea's domain, and has accordingly gained, on an average, about I I 5 feet yearly; whether at an earlier period the rate of progress was the same we cannot tell, but at all events we know that the Persian Gulf in olden times penetrated at least as far inland as the city of Babylon, where sea-shells have actually been found, and doubtless a good deal further. However that may be, it is clear that at one time the sites of the earliest centres of Sumerian civilization located in Southern Mesopotamia were covered by the sea. Northern Mesopotamia, or Assyria, was colonized by Babylonia at a comparatively late period in the history of the country. The precise, or even the relatively approximate date at which this colonization took place, is unknown, but the date of lrishum, one of the earliest recorded Kings of Assyria,• may be roughly fixed at about 2000 B.C. Now, we should naturally expect a country exhibiting such physical characteristics as have been briefly described, to be a marshy country, and such Babylonia essentially is : Babylonia, therefore, like Egypt, required man's cooperation to render it habitable, and it was human effort alone that could convert it from a malarious
swamp into a veritable " Garden of Eden." t A question that has been often asked and variously answered is whether the Sumerians, the first civilized

of earlier ;ulers, of whom Ushpia and Kikia, Adasi and Bel-bani would appear to be the most prominent, though the names of the former rather suggest that they were foreign conquerors. (Cf. Pinches, P.S.JJ.A., xxxii. p. 42; Johns, Ancieut Assyria, p. 35.)
t "Edin" is Lhe ordinary Sumerian name for "plain."

inhabitants of Babylonia, were children of the "plain " itself, or whether they migrated from some other land. Some light is thrown upon this problem by the language and writing of this early people: in Sumerian the same ideograph or hieroglyph bears two distinct meanings *-the one "land" and the other "mountain," from which we may infer that originally the two were practically synonymous to the Sumerian ; in other words, that his native land was a mountainous country ; and if this be the case, we can hardly be wrong in assigning their home to the mountainous districts of Elam, on the east of the river Tigris ; and in corroboration of this theory, it is worthy of note that both the Sumerians and also the dwellers on the other side of the Tigris spoke agglu
tinative t languages, which is some indication of the existence of a relationship between the Sumerians and the inhabitants of Elam in the remote past. But before the Sumerians descended from their mountain home into the Babylonian plain, they must have already advanced comparatively high in the scale of primitive civilization, for without a considerable knowledge of the principles of irrigation-engineering it would have been practically impossible to settle in Babylonia's marshy plain at all; it would have certainly been impossible to cultivate its soil. It

t Agglutination, as opposed to inflexion, is "the combination of !::,imple or root words into compound terms without material change or Jo~s of meaning." The words "are formed of several elements, adhering, agglutinated together, of which one only possesses its own peculiar value, the others being coupled with it to define it, and having an entirely relative signification." These affixes when placed Lefore t!-,e ruot are called " prefixes" ; when placed ::tfter the root, they are ca!!ecl u suffixes.,,

is, indeed, true that other seemingly contradictory linguistic evidence may be cited in favour of the theory that the original home of the Sumerians is to be sought in the whereabouts of the Persian Gulf; and in support of the same, the veneration accorded to the Fish-god Ea of Eridu, from the earliest times, may be adduced as cumulative evidence; but, on the whole, the mountain theory has, so far as our present knowledge goes, the greater degree of probability. It was, moreover, these Sumerians who founded the earliest centres of civilization in the Euphrates Valley; and it was they who invented the highly elaborated pictorial script, the cursive forms of which are known as " cuneiform," so called from the Latin cuneus, a " wedge," the characters being formed by a series of combinations of wedge-shaped signs. Their wedge-shaped formation was due to the impossibility of drawing the curves and lines necessary for the production of pictures, on so plastic a substance as moist clay, the material which in later days was used for all ordinary writing purposes. Fortunately, however, sufficient has come down to us to establish the pictographic origin of the later cuneiform beyond dispute, apart from the general truism that all alphabets and all modes of writing find their ultimate parents in pictures, which first of all represented simply the objects depicted, and then ideas connected directly or indirectly with these objects. The accompanying illustrations (taken from Barton's admirable article on Sumerian pictography in Harper's Memorial Volumes, for the permission to reproduce which I am indebted to the kindness of the University of Chicago Press) show the process by which the early picture-characters deteriorated

into cursive cuneiform. The hieroglyph in the lefthand column gives us the earliest form of the sign as yet discovered, the right-hand column presenting us with the various forms the sign has assumed on the different bricks and monuments, arranged in order of evolution, so to speak, while the last sign in this column gives us the ordinary cursive Assyrian ideograph. In Fig. r "A" the first hieroglyph is clearly that of a fish, the series of signs in the centre illustrating the manner in which the original picture-character gradually discarded the marks of its pictorial origin, until it finally becomes stereotyped into the regular cursive ideograph, the principal value of which is a "fish," and also " to peel," from preparing a fish for food. The second hieroglyph (" B ") also represents a fish, but a fish provided with a dorsal fin, indicative of its strength ; again its course of development is clear, the chief significations of the Assyrian ideograph being "monster," "fat" or "large." In "C" we have the wavy lines for water, which is similarly represented in both Chinese and Egyptian hieroglyphics. In "D" we apparently have a representation of the little irrigated ditches by which Babylonian gardens were watered; hence the cuneiform ideogram derives the meaning "field," and stands for two distinct Assyrian words-·" i~lu" and "ginu," both of which mean "field." Below (" E ") we have a hieroglyph of somewhat doubtful origin; some scholars regard it as a leathern bottle, which would readily account for the signification of the derived ideogram-" desert"; Barton, however, regards it as a rude outline of the Euphrates valley, with its two rivers and its "occasional sections of

irrigated and so fertile land," indicated by the: crosslincs, and he says with some plausibility that this would account for the meanings "plain " and "lands," and by an extension "desert," "elevated country," and, lastly, "back." In "F" we are probably to see the picture of a house, for the later cursive cuneiform sign derived from it is the normal Assyrian ideogram for "bitu " ("house"). "Bitu" is the Assyrian variation of the Hebrew " Beth," which occurs in the proper names Bethlehem, "house of bread," Bethshemesh, "house of the sun," etc. In "G" there is a representation of a potted plant; this sign, instead of becoming simpler as it makes each progressive step towards cuneiform, paraqoxically becomes more complex, until it at last subsides and assumes its late cursive form, the principal ideographic value of which is a ·• cypress-tree." Below (" H ") we have two plants in a pot; the course of its development is again obvious, the meanings of the later cuneiform sign being "plant" and "garment" ; this latter meaning is probably attached to the sign through the use of flax as a material for clothing. " I " is apparently a picture of a tree growing by water; the derived Assyrian ideograph has numerous values, but none of them suggest any immediate connection with the signification of the pictograph to which it
owes its ongm. "J" gives us a picture of a reed, the late cuneiform character being the ideogram for "kanu," a "reed." In Fig. 2 "K" we have the rough o~tline of a man in a recumbent posture, and one can follow its course of development from the various forms it has assumed on monuments and tablets arranged in order of evolutionary sequence. Apart from these signs of the transition period, it would be

quite impossible to conjecture that the late Assyrian
ideogram ( = "amclu," a "man") actually originated in the picture of a man. Below (" L ") we have the hieroglyph for "king," consisting of a man lying down, surmounted by either a crown, or else an umbrella, as a part of the insignia of royalty. In "M" we have a sketch of a man's head, the head being recumbent and the lips represented by two short lines; its deterioration into cursive cuneiform is again apparent, the late Assyrian ideograph bearing the meaning "mouth." The hieroglyph below, "N," is also a picture of a man's head, though in this case the man wears a beard represented by six slanting lines ; the original signification of the pictograph was probably a " full-grown man," hence the meaning of the Assyrian ideograph derived from it is "strength." In "0" we have a representation of a covered and probably steaming pot ; hence are derived the meanings of the cursive cuneiform sign-to "burst forth," "exult," "rejoice." "P" would appear to -be a priestly vestment, inasmuch as the signification of the derived Assyrian ideogram is sangu, a "priest." "Q " is a rude picture of either a crown or a ceremonial umbrella, as the emblem of greatness, the picture of an Assyrian king attended by a slave with an umbrella being sufficiently familiar from its frequent occurrence on the later wall bas-reliefs. However that may be, the derived Assyrian sign is the normal ideogram for rabu (the root which occurs in Rabsaris, Rabshakeh, etc.), which means great. We have already seen this sign compounded with the picture of a man (" L "), the two together representing a "king." Lastly, in "R" we have a picture

of a bowl in which two tin cl er-sticks have been inserted, in order to ignite them by friction, from which is derived the meaning attaching to the cuneiform sign developed from it-" fire." But at the time of Khammurabi, in the twentieth century B.C., the Babylonian script had long since lost its pictorial character if it had not already donned the

clothes of full-fledged cuneiform. The writing of what may be called the transition period, the period during which the old Sumerian picture-writing was deteriorating into the later cursive script, is well illustrated on the bricks of Ur-Engur, King of Ur, about 2400 or so B.C., of which a specimen is seen in Fig. 3. It will at once be observed that the original pictorial character of the signs is in most cases non-existent,

or at least if it may be said to exist at all, is far from being transparently obvious: two signs, however, are deserving of note, one of which occupies the first position in the top line, and is the picture of an irregularly formed star. This sign is the Sumerian ideograph or hieroglyph for" god," from which it may be inferred that the earliest Sumerian conception of deity was intimately associated with the starry heights above us, a characteristic feature of many primitive religions and theologies. The second sign of special interest occupies the first place in the top line of the second column, and is, as we have already had occasion to observe, the ideograph for king. But the decipherers of the cuneiform inscriptions had no pictures even of the most emaciated character to guide them in their herculean task The inscriptions which yielded their hidden secrets to Rawlinson, Hincks, Norris, and other scholars, were the trilingual inscriptions of the Ach~menian Kings of Persia, the most famous of which was that engraved by order of Darius on the rock at Behistun (cf. Fig. 4). As in the case of the Egyptian hieroglyphs, it was the proper names that gave the clue which was so brilliantly followed up by European savants and which ultimately led to the decipherment of Persian, Median and Assyrian cuneiform. The inscriptions of these Ach~menian kings were written in these three languages arranged in parallel columns: the column which first received attention as appearing less formidable than the others by reason of the comparatively small number of varieties of signs contained therein, turned out to be the Persian. In this column it was observed that certain groups of signs recurred

14 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIDLE LANDS
at intervals throughout the inscription without variation, and this fact led to the correct assumption that these unvarying combinations were probably the names of kings. Fortunately the Ach~menian dynasty was but a short one, and it only remained to ascertain the early classical forms of these kings' names, and then test the theory by seeing if the number of letters in these kings' names corresponded with the number of signs in the unvarying groups, for it had already been rightly guessed that the script in question, containing apparently but few signs compared with the other two scripts, must be alphabetic. By this means the Persian cuneiform equivalents for some of the letters of the alphabet were discovered, and whereever else these same signs occurred, their alphabetic values were substituted, the reconstruction of the old Persian language itself being greatly facilitated by the discovery early in the last century of the cognate Zend language (the language in which the Avesta, the Bible and pra~r-book of the later Zoroastrian faith, was written ; this faith was probably held by the early Acha:!menian kings of Persia). In the other two parallel versions of the inscription, it was a comparatively easy task to identify the proper names, recurring as they did at about the same intervals as in the Persian column, and thus the values of some of the Assyrian syllabic characters were ascertained, while the Hebrew language itself proved of the utmost importance in the process of unravelling the mysteries of this dead language of bygone days. The cuneiform script had a strange and varied history extending over thousands of years and being used for quite a host of languages;



ll/\BYLONIJ\, THE NATIVE LAND OF AlrR/\HAYl 15
it owed its existence to the absence of stone and the abundance of clay in the Babylonian plain, and the consequent employment of the latter for writing purposes, though the clay-born wedges were in later times faithfully reproduced on slabs and monuments of stone, so strong is the influence exerted by habit on the Oriental mind. We have already seen that the script was merely a cursive development of the early picture-characters of the Sumerians, though of course the actual wedge-shaped formation of each sign was simply due to the use of clay. As to the racial parentage of these Sumerians, the pioneers of Mesopotamian civilization, little can positively be stated, suffice it to say that their language was agglutinative and not inflexional, and therefore neither Aryan like our own, nor Semitic like Hebrew, but at least in this respect akin to some of the Mongolian languages ; while certain scholars (notably
Dr. C. J. Ball) have seen a resemblance between the Sumerian pictographs and the Chinese hieroglyphs, and have endeavoured to trace a connection between some Sumerian roots and certain Chinese words. The Sumerian writing was moreover ideographic in character-i.e. each sign originally represented an object or an idea. The process by which an ideographic system may pass into one that is syllabic is comparatively easy to follow. Thus, a picture of an arm would at first only represent an arm, but it would soon become the symbol of strength and power. At this stage the ideogram is still only associated with one general idea, but the variations in the verbal expressions of that fundamental idea might be very numerous, and therefore the phonetic values of the sign would be



16 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
equally numerous. Finally, when the sign ceased to bear even the faintest resemblance to the original picture, it would retain the phonetic values simply as phonetic values. For example, a character with the 111ea11i11g, and therefore in this connection with the p!trmctic ,•a/11e of the word "win," would subsequently come to represent the syllable" win" quite apart from the root meaning of the word "win," thus the sign might be used to represent the first syllable in the word win-te1-. Assyrian (Babylonian differs only dialectically from Assyrian) is mainly syllabic, though it contains a large number of ideograms as well. The same character is often used ideographically to represent an object or an idea, and also syllabically, the same sign frequently representing several syllables, The Hebrew language is closely allied to Assyrian, but the writing is, of course, alphabetic. The one great fact to be borne in mind, however, is that neither the Semitic Babylonians nor the Hebrews were the originators of Mesopotamian civilization, but both merely entered into the labours of their Sumerian predecessors. But let us inquire what the excavations themselves have to tell us regarding the physical characteristics of the Sumerians, their general type of face as well as the shape and form of their heads. Very early sculptures might here be reproduced to illustrate the salient features of the first civilized inhabitants of Babylonia, but it will perhaps be more in keeping with the object of this volume to confine ourselves to an examination of those monuments which, if they do not actually belong to the period of Biblical history, at least may be assigned to a date not far removed from the era of
Khammurabi ( = "Amraphel" of Gen. xiv.(?) cf. p. 53).

In Fig. 5 we have the head of no less a personage than Gudea, patesi or priest-king of Lagash, who reigned about 2450 B.c., and therefore some four or five centuries before Khammurabi's time. The head itself is thickset and heavy in style, while the large nose and dilated nostrils, as also the almond-shaped eyes (an especially Sumerian characteristic) and the thick lips are very noticeable features. His head, strange to say, was

unearthed before the body to which it belonged ; as the head bears no inscription, it was not known to whom it belonged until the recovery of the body m subsequent excavations, furnished the necessary information. Several statues of Gudea were recovered from the ruined mounds of Tel16 (the site of ancient Lagash), in some of which the patesi is standing, while in others he is seated (cf. Figs. 6, 7). Gudea's attitude in Fig. 7 is that of a worshipper C

ilwaiting the orders of his god, just as David is said to have gone in and "sat before the Lord" (2 Sam. vii. I S), the clasped hands being a further token of submissiveness. The head and statues reproduced are made of the same material, a hard stone of volcanic origin usually called diorite. The employment of these hard stones, as contrasted with the use of the softer alabaster and limestone in Assy, ia, is a characteristicall)' Babylonian feature. Gudea s,:ems to have been a great builder, though the remains of his building operations are not so extensive as was at first supposed ; on the discovery of a large edifice at Lagash containing a number of bricks bearing the name of Gudea, it was rashly assumed that the building in question was

of his own statements as recorded on the monuments, bricks, and statues. From these we learn that he scoured the remote as well as the neighbouring districts in search of material for his buildings, and specifically for the temple E-ninnu, obtaining wood, of which the most important kinds seem to have

been cedar and "urkarinnu," and various species of stone, including marble, from the mountains of Arabia and Syria, while he procured copper from the land of Elam on the east of the Tigris. The reason for going so far afield for wood and stone was an all-compelling one, namely, the absence of stone or timber suitable for building purposes in the low-lying Babylonian plain. But what could only be obtained at an infinitude of cost and labour, was not unnaturally valued accordingly ; and the Babylonian showed the value which he set upon stone by chiselling an inscription on objects made of that material, even upon such prosaic objects as gatesockets, one of which bearing an inscription of Gudea is seen in Fig. 8. Having made these few prefatory observations we are better able to discuss the results of the excavations themselves and their



IJAJIYLONI/1, THE NATIVE LAND OF ABRAHAM 21
bearing on the political and religious history of the Hebrews. Of vast importance have been the monuments, the stcla:, and the bas-reliefs disinterred by Botta, Layard, and others, to the student of Mesopotamian arch.eology; but perhaps of even greater importance have been the comparatively insignificant clay tablets to the student of ancient religions. Some of these clay tablets contain the Babylonian accounts of the creation, others their traditions concerning the deluge, while yet others detail the incidents of the life of Gilgamesh, the hero of Babylonian folk-lore, whose history presents parallels to many ideas expressed or implied in the Old Testament. Before the excavations had restored to us the original account of the Babylonian creation-legends, we already knew something of their cosmological conceptions from the history of Berosus, a Babylonian priest in the third or fourth century B.C. U nfortunately the history of Berosus itself, extending as it did over the whole period of life, beginning with the creation of the world and reaching down to his own time, has been lost ; but parts of it, including the creation story, are preserved in the works of later writers, and notably Eusebius. But, thanks to the late George Smith, we are in possession of the Babylonian accounts themselves, or Assyrian copies of the Babylonian accounts, written in cuneiform and inscribed on clay tablets. For the most part, the later account of Berosus agrees with the original, but as the latter is obviously of far greater importance, it would perhaps be somewhat superfluous in this connection to discuss the story recorded by Berosus, or to examine the points of divergence between the two accounts.



THE LATEST LIGHT ON nrnLE LANDS
Both the Hebrew and Babylonian cosmologies take us back to the time when the earth was not and the heaven was not, when there were no plants, and all was a primceval and chaotic mass of water, According to the Babylonians this wild ocean-deep was ruled over by or personified in two deities, Apsu. and his wife Tiamat, Apsu representing the male and Tiamat the female principle in the universe. Tiamat is the Babylonian form of Te'hom, the word used for the "deep" in Genesis, the final "t" being merely the ordinary feminine termination. These two primceval deities had two children whom they called Lakhmu and Lakhamu, and they had two grandchildren, An-shar and Ki-shar, the first halves of whose two names arc~ the ordinary Sumerian words for heaven and earth, An-shar a.nd Ki-shar thus representing all things celestial and all things terrestrial. An-shar and Ki-shar in turn produced the three famous gods, Anu, Enlil, and Ea. Now, while the newly created gods stood forth as the champions of order and system in the universe, Apsu and Tiamat continued in confusion and disorder, hating what they called the " new way" of the gods, and they determined to suppress the progressive era which the gods had thus been the means of ushering in. They accordingly plotted a rebellion, with the help of their servant Mummu; but the god Ea frustrated their designs, and compassed the overthrow of both Apsu. and Mummu. Tia.mat, however, succeeded in eluding the enemy, her success possibly being attributable to her sex, and at the instigation of a certain god named Kingu, she resolved to avenge their fate. To carry her purpose into good effect, she created a brood of hideous monsters, whom she



BABYLONIA, THE NATIVE LAND OF ABRAHA;,l 23
placed under the command of Kingu. The second tablet records how that Ea, apprised of this new rebellion, at once conveyed the evil news to his father An-shar, who prevailed upon the god Anu to go forth and meet Tiamat ; but at the sight of Tiamat and her monsters, his courage failed him, and he beat a speedy retreat. An-shar next approached the god Marduk (the Merodach found in the Biblical proper names, Merodach, Merodachbaladan, and Evil-Merodach), and the latter agreed to fight Tiamat and her brood on one condition, and that was, that he should be elected champion of the gods. The third tablet records the meeting of the gods in their council-chamber, U pshukkinaku, where they had a right regal feast, at the conclusion of which they elected Marduk as their champion. The fourth tablet is mainly concerned with a description of the battle fought between Marduk as the representative of law and order, and Tia.mat as the incarnation of confusion and chaos, and the complete triumph of the former. Marduk went forth in his four-horsed chariot, with the winds in his wake and armed with a mighty spear (cf. Fig. 9). He spread out his net we are told, to catch her, he drove the winds down her throat, he seized the spear and drove it into her vitals, and last of all, as a grand finale, he split her in half like a flat fish, and from one half of this divided monster of disorder he formed the firmament above, while from the other half he fashioned the earth beneath. Thus did method and system ultimately overcome the passive, or perhaps we should say the active, resistance of inert matter. The fifth tablet

treats of the creation of the stars and the stablishing of the year of twelve months, as also of the

appointment of the moon to regulate the days. In the sixth tablet the work of creation reaches its

destined goal in the appearance of man, whom Marduk formed from his own body; at the latter's request another god, Ea, severed Marduk's head, and from the blood which flowed and from bone he made man ; thus was man not merely fashioned after the image and likeness of God, he was literally "bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh ; " Marduk, furthermore, did not merely travail to bring forth this his perfected work, he sacrificed himself to the uttermost, man's creation actually involving the sacrifice of the deity, although, as a god, he was of course immune from death itself. The seventh tablet contains the hymn of the gods composed in honour of Marduk and in praise of his wonderful work of creation. It will be seen at once that the story is incomplete, giving no account of the creation of the animals, and affording no information concerning the origin of the vegetable world. This is at once explained by the fact that only about one.half of the story has come down to us, the tablets having been the ill-used victims of time, climate, and other detrimental influences, but from what remains of it we see at once that it is of composite origin, for only upon this hypothesis can we adequately explain the introduction of Apsu. and Mummu by the side of Tia.mat, and moreover the priestly redactors of the ancient tradition had clearly one end in view, and that was the glorification of Marduk, their god, But although the Marduk creation story briefly recorded above, is the best-preserved and the most complete that has come down to us, there is positive evidence of the existence of other legends in which other gods play the role of Marduk, and



~6 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BinLE LANDS
notably the god Ea of Eridu, the god of the deep, who was represented in the form of a fish. The attribution of the creation of the world to Ea, the god of the deep, was singularly apt, and in entire accordance with the tradition that the world was itself evolved from the prim::eval deep, whilst the latter tradition, recorded alike in the Old Testament and in the clay tablets of Mesopotamia, finds its natural origin in the observed facts of physical science, Babylonia herself having literally and truly emerged out of the sea. But the progressive drama of Babylonia's conquest over the waters of the Persian Gulf was reproduced yearly in a somewhat different manner, and on a smaller scale at the time of the annual inundation : then, too, did the gods of order ultimately vanquish the desolating forces of disorder, and the land emerge once more triumphant out of the chaos of the overflowing waters. The similarity, if not the actual identity of the material setting, of both the Hebrew and Babylonian cosmologies is sufficiently obvious, and sufficiently natural, but the corresponding dissimilarity in the theological conceptions of which both stories are the expression calls for an explanation. Both peoples inherited the same traditions, for both were children of the same country as well as being racially akin, and also the co-heirs of the same civilization, and accordingly any ideas or beliefs which were solely the outcome of natural considerations would inevitably be more or less the same among both nations, but upon what hypothesis are we to explain the extraordinary points of difference in these two accounts of the creation of the world ? On the one



BJ\flYLONIA, THE NATIVE LAND OF ABRAHAM n
hand we have one God who pre-exists all things, who is over all, and in whom all things live and move and have their being, as well as their ultimate explanation ; while on the other hand we are confronted with a host of gods, mostly at variance with each other, and one and all evolved from or, in the case of Apsfl and Tiamat, identified with the same watery chaos from which the earth itself was created and made, and while we may well admit our inability to account for these differences, we cannot fail to appreciate their significance.
J•Aolo , .l!ttmd!. FIG. 10.-Cylinder-seal of" Fall."
Among other Biblical stories which have their counterparts in Babylonia and Assyria, we may possibly include the Old Testament account of Man's Fall. In Fig. IO we have a reproduction of an impression from an old Babylonian cylinderseal, which we must probably assign to about the time of Khammurabi. Two beings, apparently divine, are here portrayed, seated on either side of a sacred tree, and a serpent erect behind one of them. It is quite true that the similarity between the pictorial representation here and the wordpicture in Genesis may be purely a coincidence, but



~s THE LATEST LIGHT ON 13113LE LANDS
the existence of cognate creation-myths, delugestories, and other early traditions among both peoples would be fully in accordance with, if it did

not actually lead us to expect, a Babylonian counterpart of the story of the Fall, though the divine character of the figures here is difficult to explain.



nAnYLONIA, THE NATIVE LAND OF ADRAIIAM 19
The sacred tree, here depicted, was a very popular object of veneration among the Babylonians and Assyrians; they did not confine themselves to engraving it upon their cylinder-seals, but they also sculptured it on the walls of their palaces: it is usually the object of the immediate attention of two winged beings of composite character standing on either side, though it seems probable that the two figures are but a duplicated representation of one and the same individual. Sometimes these weird creatures are merely human beings provided with wings (cf. Fig. I r), reminding us of the cherubim placed "to guard the way to the Tree of Life " after man's expulsion from the Garden of Eden ; sometimes, on the other hand, the bird-element attains greater prominence, the human head being exchanged for that of an eagle, as seen in Fig. I 2. These eagle-headed monsters at once recall the visions of the prophet Ezekiel, in which that prophet beheld winged cherubim, every one of which, we are told, had four faces, the first being the face of a cherub, the second the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. Inasmuch as the material basis and setting of dreams is always to be found in the scenes and objects with which we are familiar in our waking moments, however distorted they may be, it would be no unnatural query to ask the " why" and the "wherefore" of the abnormal forms assumed by the beings of Ezekiel's visions ; but a recollection of the fact that Ezekiel was the prophet of the Exile, that he prophesied from Babylonia, and therefore was probably quite familiar with these composite creatures so characteristic of Mesopotamian



30 THE LATEST LIGHT ON ll!BLE LANDS
art, affords us an immediate explanation of what would otherwise be rather paradoxical, to say the least. The lessons which through the medium of these materialized visions he learnt himself, and
FIG. 12.-Eagle-heaued monster.
in turn transmitted to his own and to all future generations, were obviously not dependent on the fram ework or mirror through which these lessons were



fli\flYLONI/\, TIIE Ni\TIVE Li\ND OF AflR/\Hi\M :ir
conveyed to his mind, but it is only the framework with which we are here concerned. The rJ/e which these composite creatures were destined to play, and the vocation in life to which they were called, would appear to be that of guardianship, though it would perhaps be hazardous to say how far they fulfilled their duty in this respect: similarly the functions which the cherubim in Genesis were called upon to perform were those of guardianshipthey were placed at the east of the Garden of Eden, together with a flaming sword which turned every way, "to keep the way to the Tree of Life." Sometimes these mythical beings are rendered yet more composite in character, assuming the form of gigantic winged human-headed bulls or lions, as seen in Fig. I 3 ; thus here, to the wisdom, sagacity, and intelligence of the man, and the power of flight of the bird, emblematic of swiftness of perception, we have added the strength of the bull, ever the type alike of fertility and strength among the peoples of antiquity. These gigantic bulls, some of which weighed as much as fifty tons, and made from a solid block of stone, were placed on either side of the portals of the king's palace with a view to deterring the advance of subterranean demons. It required three hundred of Sir Henry Layard's men to move one of these colossal animals, and it must have required at least as many to drag it originally from the quarry to the palace of Sargon, at Nimrud (the ancient Calah). But the skill required for effecting the transit of these gigantic bulls is as nothing compared with the mechanical knowledge involved in their exact adjustment on either side of the palace gates.



,~ THE LATEST LIGHT ON nrnLE LANDS
It will be seen from the figure, that these bulls,
/'/,oto, Afanse/1. FIG. 13 .-Winged bull.
strange to say, are provided with five legs ; this,



BABYLONIA, THE 0iATIVE LAND OF ABRAHAM 33
however, is not an intentional idiosyncrasy on the part of the artist, it is merely a clever artifice to avoid an inevitable drawback, from an artistic point of view, necessitated by the material with which he had to deal. It will be observed that the legs are not strictly carved in the round, but are raised in high relief from the massive block out of which the bull itself is formed ; it is thus solid throughout, its solidity rendering it imperfect to the artistic eye, for the four legs of a living bull can generally be all seen together when viewed from the side ; accordingly the sculptor has devised a very clever contrivance whereby he has, in a great measure, surmounted the difficulty; he has provided the bull with a fifth leg, the result of which is that the bull now appears perfectly natural from both points of view. Looked at in front, the bull's two fore-legs are seen planted firmly on the ground in a stationary attitude, while viewed from the side, the bull is walking along in a perfectly natural manner. Our subject now takes us away from the sculptor and his extraordinary works of art to the no less wonderful work of the engraver. We have already had occasion to examine one early &bylonian cylinder-seal upon which the apparent counterpart to the Biblical "story of the Fall" was seen portrayed, and there are other Babylonian and Assyrian seals upon which are depicted figures and scenes recalling, in one way or another, passages in the Old Testament. The seals of the Babylonians took the form of small cylinders, through which a wire was passed, the seal being slung round the neck by means of a string attached to the wire. Herodotus tells us that in his day every Babylonian
D



34 THE LATEST LIGHT ON lllllLE LANDS
wore a seal, and, though doubtless this is an exaggerated statement, without doubt they were exceedingly common, for thousands of them have been found in the ruined mounds. The seals themselves are often made of the hardest stones, such as marble, jasper, onyx, rock-crystal, ha:matite, and steatite. The engraving itself was done with the help of a graving instrument, probably made of metal, while the deeper incisions were made by means of a drill. The seal in its simplest form merely bore the figure of its owner, his name, and sometimes that of his father, but later on, the Babylonians, being an exceedingly religious people, acquired the habit of portraying their favourite gods on their seals, and finally the whole of the field of the cylinder was occupied with gods, mythical beings with horns and tails, and the like. The interest of these cylinders for our immediate purpose lies in the fact that they present us with scenes from the earliest known Babylonian stories and legends, and as these so often resemble ideas and traditions recorded in the Hebrew Scriptures, they deserve some attention. The most famous of these stories centre round the person of Gilgamesh, the hero of Babylonian folklore, whose gigantic strength and colossal feats won for him a reputation similar to that enjoyed by Samson among the Hebrews, and Hercules among the Greeks and Romans ; his career was briefly set forth in a number of clay tablets, of which fragments have come down to us. From these we learn that Gilgamesh went forth to besiege the city of Erech (cf. Gen. x. 10); the city apparently held out three years, but was ulti~



TIABYLONIA, THE NATIVE LAND OF ABRAI-IA:VI 3;
mately captured, whereupon Gilgamesh established himself as king over the people of Erech. But his rule was severely harsh, and the people appealed to their goddess Aruru to rid them of the tyrant. Aruru responded to their appeal and promised to help them, and with a view to doing- so she created a strange being, half man and half beast, furnished with long hair like that of a woman, and resembling the corn-god. The name of this composite monster was Eabani. Gilgamesh was naturally much alarmed when he heard of the creation of this formidable adversary, and cast about for a way of escape: to engage in mortal combat could only prove mortal to himself, but he bethought him of a plan which proved entirely successful. He sought out a beautiful woman named Ukhat, whom he sent in company with Saidu, the huntsman, to Eabani in order to lure him back to Erech and there make friends with him. The ruse succeeded admirably, and Eabani being delighted with the charms of Ukhat followed that lady in a short time back to Erech, where Gilgamesh received him, and the two heroes became bosom friends. Soon after this friendship had been cemented, Gilgamesh and Eabani set out together to besiege Khumbaba, the King of Elam, in his castle: either alone would have been formidable, but the two together were, of course, irresistible, and consequently the castle was taken, and Khumbaba was slain. Full of their recent triumph, the two friends returned to Erech, but soon after, Gilgamesh committed a grave indiscretion in regard to no less a person than that of Ishtar (cf. Fig. 14), the Ashtoreth of the Bible, and the goddess of love and war. lshtar had

vigour of his production, may well command our unstinted admiration. The conquest of the bull had in the meanwhile left Ishtar's insult still unavenged, and, added to this, at the banquet held in honour of the victory over Alu, Eabani had foolishly threatened to serve Ishtar as he had served the bull, and as a result



38 THE LATEST LIGHT ON DIBLE LANDS
Ishtar, by some means unknown, brought about the death of Eabani. Gilgamesh was heart-broken at the loss of his friend, but his great anxiety was lest a like fate should befall himself, and, in the hope of finding some means of escape, he determined to seek out his ancestor, Sit-napishtim, who had attained the gift of immortality in bygone days. That night he had a dream, in which the Moon-god appeared to him, and revealed to him part of the way to the "Mountain of Sunset," and with the help of this partial information, Gilgamesh set out on his quest for immortality. On his arrival at the Mountain of Sunset, he found the gates guarded by a Scorpion-man and his

there were trees from which hung-not fruit, but precious stones. But so intent was Gilgamesh on his quest for immortality, that he disregarded the precious stones, and went straight to the palace of the Princess Sabitu, who was not at first disposed to grant him an audience, but was at last prevailed upon to do so. When he at length gained her presence, she inquired his mission, in response to which Gilgamesh told her of the sad fate of his friend Eabani, and of his anxiety to find his ancestor, ~it-napishtim, and thus avoid a similar fate himself. But Sabi tu was not encouraging; she told him of the perils of a voyage such as he desired to undertake, and informed him that, moreover, there was only one person in the world who could help him, and that was Arad-Ea, the sailor. Gilgamesh accordingly wended his way to AradEa's abode, and asked him whether he would convey
F1G. 18.-Gilgamesh oi,cl :\racl-Ea in their wssel.
him in his boat over the waters of death ; to this AradEa assented on the condition that Gilgamesh went into the forest, cut down a tree, and fashioned a new steering-pole therefrom. Gilgamesh quickly fulfilled this condition, and the two embarked in Arad-Ea's



40 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
boat upon the perilous journey of which Sabitu had already told Gilgamesh much (cf. Fig. 18); whether her description was surpassed by the reality itself or not, we cannot say, but everything has its appointed end, and even this never-to-be-forgotten voyage at last came to an end. As the boat drew near the shore, $it-napishtim and his wife hastened down to inquire who the new arrivals were, and what was the object of their journey; Gilgamesh told his story, and concluded by asking $it-napishtim to convey to him the secret of immortality's priceless gift. $it-napishtim's reply, alike graphic in its conciseness and tragic in its import, was to the effect that "as long as houses are built, and as long as brethren quarrel, and as long as the waters of the river flow into the sea, so long shall death come to every man," whereupon Gilgamesh inquired how $it-napishtim had thus alone been enabled to overcome the law of universal death, in reply to which question $it-napishtim proceeded to tell him the story of the Flood. When Sit-napishtim was on earth, he dwelt in a certain city on the Euphrates called Shuruppak (the modern Fara), the ruined mounds of which city were excavated some time ago by the German excavators, Koldewey, Andrae, and Noeldeke. The excavations conducted on this ancient site have yielded a rich harvest of material for the reconstruction of the early history of the Sumerians. The buildings unearthed would all appear to date from the pre-Sargonic period, but it is the graves that have proved of the greatest value to the archa!ologist. From the disposition of these, we now know that in the earliest times the corpses were contracted as in

Sit-napishtim hearkened unto the god's directions and built his boat, just as did his counterpart Noah, and he, his wife, his family, his cattle, and

This new fragment was thought to throw fresh light on the Biblical account, and to conlain an allusion to the introduction of pairs of animals into the ark by Noah, but though" beasts of the field (and) birds of the hea,-en,, are mentioned in line I r, and" the habitation of a number"{?) occurs at lhe en<l of line 12, there is nothing in the text about pairs of animals entering the ark, and its importance fron1 the Biblical stand

Seven days later $it-napishtim sent forth a dove, just as Noah did, to see whether the waters had sufficiently subsided for him to disembark on to dry land, but the dove could find no rest for the sole of her foot and so returned to the ark ; some days later he sent forth a swallow-it will be remembered that there is no mention of a swallow in the Biblical story-but the swallow in like manner returned; last of all, like Noah, he despatched a raven, but though the latter returned and croaked

DADYLONIA, 'tHE NATIVE LAND OF ABRAHAM 45
same way as Noah is said to have "built an altar unto the Lord," and to have "offered burnt offerings on the altar." ~it-napishtim's sacrifice was evidently peculiarly savoury and luscious, for we are told that " the gods came down to smell the sacrifice like flies," a description which in its materialism contrasts somewhat strikingly with the dignified words of the Biblical writer: "And the Lord smelled a sweet savour" (Gen. vii. 21). But the god Enlil, contrary to Jehovah-who is in Genesis similarly represented as the author of the deluge-was enfuriated at the escape of ~it0 napishtim and his companions. However, being ultimately mollified by the god Ea, he permitted the fortunate survivors to live, and not only so, but afterwards himself bestowed upon Sitnapishtim the gift of immortality.
During the recital of $it-napishtim's brief autobiography, Gilgamesh lay sick in his boat by the water's edge, and on the seventh day a heavy sleep overcame him, during which $it-napishtim's wife prepared magic food, with which she fed the luckless hero while he slept. On his return to consciousness, $it-napishtim bade Arad-Ea take Gilgamesh to a certain fountain, in the healing waters of which he was to wash him, but before they set out, ~itnapishtim told Gilgamesh of a certain plant which had the properties requisite for prolonging life. Gilgamesh and his comrade succeeded in finding the plant, and were returning with it in their possession, but by the way, they grew thirsty, and stooped down to drink of a brook, and while they were drinking, a demon, in the form of a serpent, came behind them, and snatched the plant out of their grasp, and



46 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
Gilgamesh's chance of everlasting life, relative or actual, as the case may be, was thus gone for ever. We see here the gift of life associated with a plant or tree, reminding us of the "Tree of Life " in the Garden of Eden, while in both stories, the evil genius that thus deprived man of the immortal boon, is imaged in the form of a serpent. Gilgamesh was cruelly disappointed, and returned to Erech, where he spent the rest of his life mourning for his old friend Eabani. And he conceived a violent longing to have another glimpse of his departed comrade, and accordingly besought the gods to gratify his desire, by bringing up Eabani from the Halls of Hades. But they one and all refused, until at last he came to Nergal, the god of the dead, who finally acceded to his request. \Ne are told that Nergal opened the ground and "caused the spirit of Eabani to come forth l.ike wind," reminding us of the necromancing witch of Endor's reply to Saul's interrogation, "What seest thou?" -" I see gods-or Elohim (the word being used generally for God in the Old Testament, but denoting here spirit-beings)-arising out of the earth." When Gilgamesh was thus confronted with the shade of his lamented friend, he asked him for information regarding the character of the nether world and of the life after death, but Eabani, anxious not to sadden the heart of Gilgamesh, endeavoured to dissuade him from his question ; Gilgamesh, however, persisted, and so at length Eabani told him that it was a land where the worm devours and where all is cloaked in dust-" Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return" (Gen. iii. 19). The story of Gilgamesh thus furnishes many close parallels to

idea5, conceptions and metaphors contained in the Old Testament.
Having briefly considered the light thrown by the excavations upon the earlier chapters in the



48 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
Book of Genesis, we naturally turn to what may be called the historic period of Old Testament literature, the time of Khammurabi, probably the Amraphel of the Book of Genesis, and in that case the first Biblical character to be actually identified on the monuments. Abraham himself is said to have come from Ur of the Chaldees, which is probably to be identified with Mu1⁄2:eyyer, the ruins of which are to be seen in Fig. 22. The mound was excavated by
J. E. Taylor in I 854, and was found to contain the remains of the ancient temple of the Moon-god, in the four corners of which were found four baked clay cylinders, from which we learn that Ur-Engur (King of Ur, i.e. c. 2400 B.C. (?)), one of whose bricks we have already had occasion to notice, founded the temple, that his son Dungi subsequently repaired it, and that Nabonidus, the last King of Babylon (555-538 B.C.), rebuilt it about two thousand years later. These cylinders are of supreme interest to the Biblical student, not only from an historical but also from a religious point of view ; but we must postpone the consideration of their contents till we come to treat of that period in a later chapter.

T
HE antiquity of Ur (Mu~eyyer) has been shown by the inscriptions yielded by the excavations of the French at Tello (Lagash) and the Americans at Nippur, two of the earliest centres of civilization in the Euphratean valley. Thus, for example, Lugalzaggisi and Lugal-kigubnidudu, two early kings who probably lived before the time of Ur-Nina (i.e. well before 3000 B.C.), the founder of the First Dynasty of Lagash, and therefore over a thousand years before the time of Khammurabi (Amraphel), Abraham's traditional contemporary, style themselves "Kings of Ur." At a somewhat later date Akurgal, the son and immediate successor of Ur-Nina on the throne of Lagash, records that he destroyed the city of Ur. Unfortunately, the ruined mound of Mu~eyyer has not received as much attention at the hands of excavators as the Biblical student could wish, and we are almost entirely dependent on the statements of the early explorers, Taylor and Loftus, and on the inscriptions discovered elsewhere, for information regarding the history of this famous city of antiquity. It is, of course, impossible to assert definitely the identity of the Ur represented by the ruined mounds at Mul_<eyyer with the Ur where Abraham is supposed E



50 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
to have lived, and whence he is said to have subsequently migrated. The fact that Haran and Ur were both centres of the worship of Sin, or Nannaru, the Moon-god, suggests that Abraham's settlement at Haran, instead of elsewhere, may have been determined by religious considerations, for though Abraham is never represented as an idolater, it is distinctly stated that his father, Terah, worshipped other gods when on the other side of the river (Josh. xxiv. 2). But, in any case, the journey from "Ur of the Chaldees "-in whatever part of "Chald::ea" the Ur in question was situated-to Haran in the north must have been sufficiently long, for Haran is about 420 miles from Babylon, while it is approximately 560 miles from Ur (l\fo~eyyer). Haran apparently derives its name from the Babylonian kharranu, which signifies a "road," and doubtless owes the origin of its name to the fact that it lay at the junction of several main roads.* Of the early history of Haran we know comparatively little, but from the probable Babylonian origin of its name we may perhaps infer that it was founded by the Babylonians at an early date, and doubtless it acknowledged Babylonian suzerainty at the time of Abraham's migration thither. During their sojourn at Haran, Terah died at the mythical age of 205. Abraham himself was seventyfive years old when he left Haran, in obedience to the Divine commands, and in reliance on the Divine promises (Gen. xii. I). Very little detail is given as to the route followed by Abraham in his joun1ey to and through the land of Canaan. Shechem, the

THE HEBREWS BEFORE THE EXODUS 51
terebinth of Moreh, and a mountain on the east of Bethel are mentioned in connection with his migration southwards, but otherwise nothing is known as to the course pursued by the Hebrew pilgrims. Soon after Abraham's arrival in the promised land he was compelled to flee to Egypt by reason of the famine. On his return to Canaan he severed himself from his nephew, and settled at Hebron. Hebron apparently included Mamre, for we read that Abraham "came and dwelt by the terebinths of Mamre, which is in Hebron" (Gen. xiii. 18) (Fig. 23). The city is said to have been built seven years before Zoan (Tanis), in Egypt (Num. xiii. 22). With regard to the name itself, its signification would appear to be "association," or "confederation" (so the Oxford Hebrew Lexicon, p. 289). It has been suggested by some scholars, including Professor Sayce,* that the place called "Khabiri-Ki," in the Tell el-Amarna Letters is none other than the Biblical Hebron, and the occurrence of the name "Khibur" in the geographical lists of Rameses III. from two to three centuries later (i.e. about 1200 B.C.) has been cited in support of this theory, but this identification is purely conjectural. There is, however, little doubt that the " Khabiri" -the accepted meaning of which is "confederates"
-and " Hebron" ( = "confederation") are both derived from the same Semitic root, and this fact militates strongly against, if it does not conclusively disprove the theory which identifies the "Khabiri"
with the" Hebrews" t (cf. further, p. 80). This city is the scene of many events recorded in

5). The name A bra111 may either mean "the father
is exalted" or "Ram ( = Ram man?) is father." Analogies may be cited for either theory; in support
of the former one might compare 'Yel1oram ( = "Jah
is exalted") for the latter A bija/1 ( = "Jah is father"). Linguistically, Abralzam and Abram are probably only dialectical variations. At Hebron the same patriarch entertained angels unawares (Gen. xviii. 2); and it was here that he buried his wife Sarah, while it was from this same place that Jacob despatched Joseph to look for his brethren. In the time of Joshua, Hebron was occupied by the warlike Anakim, to whom the foundation of the city is also apparently attributed (Josh. xv. I 3); and its earlier name is said to have been Kiriath-arba' (i.e. City of four). It was after the separation of the two kinsmen that we read of" Amraphel, King of Shinar, Arioch, King of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, King of Elam, and Tidal, King of nations," waging war against '' Bera, King of Sodom, and Birsha, King of Gomorrah, Shinab, King of Admah, and Shemeber, King of Zeboiim, and the King of Bela, which is Zoar" (Gen. xiv. r, 2). The most interesting of the kings here mentioned, whose identification has been established with any degree of certainty, is "Amraphel, King of Shinar," who is in all probability Khammurabi, King of Babylon. The correct form of this king's name would appear to be Am-mu-ra-pi-ih," of which the first part is the name of a God, and the whole possibly signifies "Am mu is the healer." Khammurabi was the sixth king of the first

Sumu-abu, the founder of the dynasty of which Khammurabi was the most illustrious member. In regard to the other names mentioned in Gen. xiv. I, Chedorlaomer has not been certainly found on the monuments, but it is a genuine Elamite formation
(probably = "servant of Lagamar "), and there is no reason why it should not be found in the future. It has been conjectured (cf. Langdon, Expositor, August, 1910, p. 132 f.) that Chedorlaomer is identical with Kudur-Mabug, governor of Emutbal in Elam, and of the "Martu" or "West-land" (a term generally applied to Syria and Palestine, but here possibly used to describe the country to the west of Emutbal). " Mabug " might be another name of the deity Lagamar, but at present there is no evidence of the fact. Arioch is possibly to be identified with Arad-Sin,* the son of Kudur-Mabug, whose name in Sumerian might well be "Eri-Aku." As to "Tidal, King of nations," his identity is as yet purely a matter of conjecture. Some tablets published by Pinches,t of late date, but incorporating probably older traditions, speak of an invasion of Babylonia by" Umman Manda" under a presumably Elamite king called Ku-dur-lak/1(.9)-gamal, who has been supposed (though some Assyriologists doubt this) to be identical with Chedorlaomer, and if this supposition is correct, it is possible that the "nations" here mentioned are the Umman Manda, and that Tidal was their leader. But all this is at present purely conjectural. • See the authorities cited by Driver (Genesis (edd. 7, 8), pp. xxxi.xxxiii.).

Gen. xxiii. speaks of Abraham as purchasing the cave of Machpelah from Hittites settled in Hebron. There is at present no clear independent evidence of a Hittite settlement in Southern Palestine at this time. Sayce • indeed claims that at the commencement of the twelfth Egyptian dynasty there is evidence of their being established there. He bases his claim on his reading of a stele in the Louvre inscribed for a certain Egyptian noble named Nessumontu, and dated in the twenty-fourth year of Amenem~at I. (circ. 2000 B.C. (?)). After stating that he has defeated "the Asiatic Troglodytes, the Sand-dwellers" (according
to Breasted's translation t), he proceeds, "I overthrew the stronghold of Ht«." The determinative attached to the name is not that of "country," but of" going," i.e. two legs. i Chiefly on this ground Breasted repudiates Sayce's reading "Kheta" (i.e. Hittites (?)) for the Ij:t'°, and argues that it must be some rare verb of "going," and might thus be provisionally rendered "nomads." In 1908 § Sayce still maintains his former position, and explains the enigmatic determinative as a mistake on the part of the scribe who supposed the Ijt'" to be connected with some otherwise unknown word signifying "to go." But however that may be, the most tangible piece of evidence for the early presence of the Hittites in Southern Palestine is afforded by the painted Hittite pottery discovered in the earlier strata at Gezer and Lachish. Breasted, indeed, while admitting that the

pottery in question is Hittite, maintains that the only certain inference that can be made from the pottery is that the Hittites traded directly or indirectly with the South Palestinians. The chief positive argument against the early settlement of Hittites in the south is that the information regarding the Hittites in the Tell el-Amarna Letters of the eighteenth Egyptian dynasty conflicts with such a theory. The Khatti are here located in the distant north, though they are represented as gradually wresting the towns of Northern Syria from the hand of the Pharaoh, while a hundred years earlier,* when Thothmes III. was campaigning in Northern Syria, he apparently had no encounter-with the Hittites, though they sent him presents, presumably from a distance. If, therefore, they had not pushed southward into Northern Syria by the time of Thothmes III. of the eighteenth dynasty, how could they have effected a settlement in Southern Palestine by the twelfth dynasty ? As Breasted says, if the Hittites had really established themselves in the south as early as the twelfth dynasty, they must have merged with the Canaanite population, and the influx of Hittites of the Tell el-Amarna period be due to a second Hittite expansion. Breasted does not commit himself to this theory, but it seems to offer the best explanation of the known facts. For though it is true that Hittite pottery in Southern Palestine at an early period may simply have arrived there as an article of trade, and preceded by centuries the actual southward advance of the Hittites themselves, at the same time ceteris paribus, it seems more natural to regard the pottery as evidence of the

THE HEBREWS BEFORE THE EXODUS 59
presence of Hittites, not necessarily many, but at all events some. Under the early kings of the first dynasty of Babylon, the Elamites had invaded Southern Babylonia, and possibly this invasion was the immediate cause of Terah's migration northwards. At the time of Khammurabi, Kudur-Mabug was the governor of Emutbal, while his son, Rim-Sin, ruled over Larsa and Ur. Chedorlaomer, whether identical (?) with Kudur-Mabug, or his overlord, might thus not unnaturally oblige Amraphel (Khammurabi) to accompany him to battle (Gen. xiv. I, 2). During the latter part of his reign, however, Khammurabi threw off the Elamite yoke, and also defeated Rim-Sin * (who succeeded his brother Arad-Sin as ruler over Larsa), and established his supremacy over Babylonia as well as over the land of Amurru (i.e. Canaan). But Khammurabi's claim to immortality rests rather on his famous compilation of Babylonian law than on his foreign conquests, great as they were. The Khammurabi code is the m_ost ancient legal code as yet known. The basalt stele (cf. Fig. 27) on which it is inscribed was discovered by M. De Morgan at Susa, where it had been taken by the Elamites as a trophy. A relief is sculptured on the upper part of the stele, in which Khammurabi is portrayed in the act of receiving the laws from Shamash the Sun-god. The text commences with a recitation of the various benefits conferred by Khammurabi on the temples and cities in Mesopotamia, after which preliminary the two hundred and

FI G. 27.-Upper part of the stele engraved with the text of

THE HEBREWS BEFORE THE EXODUS 61
eighty-two laws of the code arc set forth, while the text concludes with an invocation of blessings upon the heads of those who observe the laws herein contained and of curses upon those who neglect to do so. The dependence of the Mosaic code upon the earlier code of Khammurabi is an oft-debated question which has had no definite answer.* On the one hand, there are marked points of similarity between the two codes ; on the other hand, there are equally noticeable points of difference. Were the latter confined to questions which would only demand solution in Babylonia, on the one hand, or in Canaan on the other, it might be well argued that such dissimilarities had no real bearing on the subject. But such is not the case. Thus, for example, the Hebrew punishment for slander (Deut. xxv. 2) is scourging, while that enacted in the Khammurabi code was branding. Again, according to Hebrew law, the number of stripes to be !inflicted on a culprit was never to exceed forty, while sixty stripes are ordered in the Babylonian code for certain cases. Similarly, in regard to incest, a clause in Khammurabi's code enacts (157) that if a man has intercourse with his mother, both shall be burned, while the Mosaic law does not deal with such a case; on the other hand, the latter enacts that if a woman and her mother cohabit with the same man, both shall be burned. Further, if a man assaulted a woman with child and caused her death thereby, the Babylonian law required the death of the man's daughter. As Johns points out, this is simply the law of retaliation, though what penalty was to be exacted in the case of the man having no daughter is not specified. In
• Cf. Driver, Exodus, p. 424 f. ; Gene.sis, pp. xxxvi., xx..xvii.



6~ THE LATEST LIGHT ON TIIBLE LANDS
the Hebrew legislation the law would appear to have covered such offences by a generalization which was free from this objection, "life for life," or "soul for soul " was the penalty, the question as to whose "life " or whose "soul" was to be forfeited being wisely left open. But in both codes the penalty for a crime of this kind was burning. It must not, however, be supposed that entirely parallel cases are not dealt with in both codes, and also treated in much the same way. Thus in clause 155 in the Khammurabi code, it is enacted that a man who has intercourse with his daughter-in-law shall be bound or strangled,"' and cast into the waters, while the penalty of death is similarly inflicted on the perpetrator of the same crime in Lev. xx. 12. Again, if a man commits immorality with his father's wife, that man, according to the Babylonian law (clause 158), is to be cut off from his father's house, while the Mosaic code likewise sentences the man guilty of this offence to death (Lev. xx. II). In both codes, moreover, the stranger is on an inferior legal footing to the true Babylonian or the genuine Hebrew (cf. Khammurabi code, clauses 196-201, and Lev. xxiv. 22), while some practices in connection with the administration of the law are also common to both peoples.,t The ultimate sanction of all legal decisions is vested in the deity, who works through his divinelyappointed representatives. The place where justice is administered is the gate of the city, while the necessity of obtaining the evidence of witnesses and

THE HEBREWS BEFORE THE EXODUS 63
the corresponding denunciation of false witnesses are prominent features in both Hebrew and Babylonian law. Again, the terms of the marriage contract observed by both peoples arc also parallel ; the contract is made with the girl's parents, who receive a price for their daughter's hand from her prospective husband, this purchase-price being generally handed over to the daughter in the form of a dowry, while the principles underlying legal divorce, concubinage, and other matrimonial affairs, have been shown to be the same in both cases. We thus see that both codes are the concrete expression of the same general principles of morality, and that injustice and immorality are condemned in the same unsparing fashion in the Babylonian and Hebrew codes alike; that in some cases the laws are practically identical and are not infrequentlycouched in almost the same language, but that on the other hand, each contains laws not found in the other code. These co-existing points of similarity and divergence find their most natural explanation in the assumption that they are independent recensions of "ancient custom, deeply influenced by Babylonian law," each being modified by the peculiar requirements and habits of the people whose lives they were destined to regulate. Of the various provisions contained only in the Babylonian code, two may be singled out as being of special interest, one of which was framed to protect a patient from being experimented on by his doctor, and the other a tenant against the consequence of bad workmanship on the part of a house-builder. If a doctor uses a lancet to remove a cataract from



64 THE LATEST LIGHT ON nIBLE LANDS
a gentleman's eye, or in treatment of a severe wound, and the patient dies, or loses his eyesight, the doctor's hands were to be amputated. But if a slave died as a result of the doctor's treatment, the latter had to give a slave to the owner in his place (2 I 8, 219). Similar compensation was exacted from the doctor who treated a cow or an ass unsuccessfully. But if he cured his patient, animal or human being, as the case might be, he was entitled to an adequate fee. Again, if a man erected a house and did his work so badly that the house fell down and killed the tenant, he was put to death ; if the tenant's son were killed, then the builder's son was put to death, while any damage to the tenant's property, caused in the same way, had to be made good by the builder. "An eye for an eye " and a "tooth for a tooth " is the keynote to Hebrew and Babylonian law, and this principle of retaliation is carried out with a neverfailing consistency.* After Khammurabi's time the power of Babylon began to wane, and the inhabitants of Southern Babylonia, whose territory bordered on the shores of the Persian Gulf, asserted their independence under their king, Iluma-ilu. The precise time when this coup d'etat was made is uncertain, but Iluma-ilu is known to have waged war successfully against Samsu-iluna, the son and successor of Khammurabi. Samsu-iluna was further harrassed by the Kassites, a mountainous people, whose territory lay on the east of the Tigris, and who from time to time made raids on Babylonian territory. Samsu-iluna's followers on the throne of Babylon maintained their position,

while Ammizaduga, the fourth successor of Khammurabi, inflicted a defeat upon the Elamites; but they were unable to subjugate the people of the sea. The downfall of the dynasty was, however, brought about neither by the people of the sea nor by the Kassites, but by an invasion of Hittites, which is a significant proof of the power attained by these mountain warriors of Asia Minor, even at this early period. Soon after this, Babylon passed into the hands of the Kassites. It is, of course, possible that the Kassites had joined the Hittites in their attack on Babylon, but this is_ at present purely a matter of conjecture. It is a significant fact that Egypt's domination by the foreign Hyksos kings coincided in part with the rule of the Kassites in Babylon ; what therefore the Semites lost in Mesopotamia they temporarily gained in Egypt, if the theory which attributes a Semitic origin to the Hyksos be correct. The Kassite rule over Babylonia lasted some 576 years, while the duration of the Hyksos dominion was 5r r years, according to the tradition perpetuated by Manetho. The cause of Israel's migration to Egypt was scarcity of food. This is a factor which has been the main cause of migrations in all ages.
The date of Joseph's arrival in Egypt is unknown, but there is no doubt that it took place during the Hyksos period. The Hyksos, or Shepherd-kings of Egypt, would appear to have come from Asia, and to have been Asiatic• in origin, though, owing to the extreme paucity of the monuments bequeathed by them to posterity, their racial connections are still problematic,

and we can make no definite assertions in regard to their origin. Manetho, the native Egyptian historian, who flourished in the ,reign of Ptolemy I. (i.e. c. B.C. 30 528 S), and wrote a history of his country in Greek, gives us some information on this point. Unfortunately, the history itself has perished; but extracts are to be found in Josephus, and an epitome of it is given by Julius Africanus and Eusebius. The passage referring specifically to the Hyksos is contained in Josephus' diatribe against A pion. It reads as follows:• "There was a king of ours whose name was Timaus. Under him it came to pass-I know not how-that God was averse to us, and there came, after a surprising manner, men of ignoble birth out of the eastern parts, and had boldness enough to make an expedition into our country, and with ease subdued it by force, yet without our hazarding a battle with them. So, when they had gotten those that governed us under their power, they afterwards burned down our cities, and demolished the temples of the gods, and used all the inhabitants after a most barbarous manner-nay, some they slew, and led their children and their wives into slavery. At length they made one of themselves king, whose name was Salatis; he also lived at Memphis, and made both the upper and lower regions (i.e. Upper and Lower Egypt) pay tribute, and left garrisons in places that were most proper for them. He chiefly aimed to secure the eastern parts, as foreseeing that the Assyrians, who had then the greatest power, would be desirous of that kingdom and invade them ; and • Budge, His/o,y, iii. pp, 145 ff. ; Petric, History, i. pp. 233 ff.

as he found in the Saite (read 'Sethroite' with Budge and Petrie) Nomos a city very proper for his purpose, and which lay upon the Bubastite channel, but with regard to a certain theologic notion was called 'Avaris' (a city close to Tanis, the ancient Zoan), this he rebuilt and made very strong by the walls he built about it, and by a most numerous garrison of two hundred and forty thousand armed men whom he put into it to keep it. Thither Salatis came in summer-time, partly to gather his corn and pay his soldiers their wages, and partly to exercise his armed men, and thereby to terrify foreigners.... The whole nation was styled 'Hyksos,' that is, Shepherd-kings; for the first syllable 'Hyk,' in the sacred dialect, denotes a king, as is ' Sos' a shepherd-but this according to the ordinary dialect ; and of these is compounded ' Hyksos.' Some say they were Arabians. This people, who were styled 'kings' and 'shepherds' also, and their descendants, retained possession of Egypt during the period of five hundred and eleven years." After this he says: 11 That the kings of Thebais and of the other parts of Egypt made an insurrection against the shepherds, and that a terrible and long war was made between them, till the shepherds were overcome by a king whose name was Misfragmouthosis, and were driven out of the other parts of Egypt, and were shut up in a place containing about ten thousand acres, called 'Avaris.' " Manetho further says: 11 The shepherds built a wall round all this place, which was a large and strong wall, and this in order to keep all their possessions and their prey within a place of strength, but that Thummosis, the son of Misfragmouthosis,

endeavoured to force ,them by a siege, and beleaguered the place with a body of four hundred and eighty thousand men; but at the moment when he despaired of reducing them by siege they agreed to a capitulation that they should leave Egypt, and should be permitted to go out without molestation whithersoever they would ; and that after this capitulation they went away with their whole families and effects, not fewer in number than two hundred and forty thousand, and took their journey from Egypt through the wilderness, for Syria. But as they stood in fear of the Assyrians, who had then the dominion over Asia, they built a city in that country which is now called J ud;ea, large enough to contain this great number of men, and called it Jerusalem." Thus, according to Josephus, who professes to quote Manetho, but whose profession is called in question by some scholars, the Hyksos were shepherd-kings who came from the East, and were possibly Arabians. There is no adequate reason for discrediting this part of the story, for it is certain that the Hyksos settlements were in the east of the Delta, which in itself argues that they came fron-1 the East, and were therefore in all probability Semites. This would accord well with the traditional exaltation of Joseph to the vizir-ship, and afford a satisfactory explanation thereof, for it is generally believed that J oseph's migration to Egypt took place during the period when the Hyksos were in command of Egypt. But we are not entirely without contemporary evidence, for a soldier '" in the native Egyptian army, which expelled the foreign Hyksos kings,

THE HEBREWS BEFORE THE EXODlJS 69
informs us that their expulsion was only effected after they had laid siege to Avaris, and that the Egyptians pursued them into Southern Palestine, and "ultimately into Phcenicia or Ccelesyria." It will be thus seen that so far as it goes, this early contemporary evidence accords well with the account given by Josephus, and ascribed by him to Manctho. Now, seeing that Joseph and his brethren were in Egypt during the period of the Hyksos, with whom they were probably racially connected, the expulsion of their descendants has not unnaturally been associated with the expulsion of the Hyksos at the commencement of the eighteenth dynasty. But if the Hebrews were expelled at that period, the record in Exodus regarding the bondage in Egypt, and the building of the store-cities of Rameses and Pithom, would have to be reconsidered. It is here that Egyptian exploration comes to our aid, and throws some light upon the problems involved. The site of the ancient store-city of Pithom is represented by the modern mound Tell el-Maskhuta. This mound is situated in the north-east of the Delta, close to the desert. The excavation of this mound by Naville some years ago confirmed the Hebrew tradition regarding the nature of the city. The name Pithom signifies "house of Tum," just as Pharaoh (in Egyptian Per-o) means "the great house " (cf. Fig. 28). In the course of his excavations on this site, Naville discovered some well-built walls from two to three yards thick, made of crude bricks cemented

were discovered. These rooms, which were all disconnected, and to which access was gained only from the top, were probably used as granaries or storehouses for provisioning the armies of Rameses I I. when setting out on their Asiatic campaigns. Pithom lay close to the early settlement of Pihahiroth, and is in proximity to the modern towns of Tell el-Kabir and Kasasin, which mark the strategicai poi~ts of first importance in the eastern Delta. There seems to be no doubt in Naville's mind that these granaries were built by Rameses II. If, therefore, the Hebrews built this store-city, as they are stated to have done in Exodus i. r r, that king was the Pharaoh of the oppression, andJ.his successor, Menephthah, possibly the Pharaoh of the last and final exodus. It is worthy of note that the Hebrew Pithom existed in actual fact, and furthermore that it was a store-city. These two facts alone form, where historical and archceological evidence has nothing decisive to offer, a presumptive argument in favour of the general accuracy of the Biblical story.



THE HEBREWS BEFORE THE EXODUS 73
It will be remembered that in the initial stages of the traditional building-operations of the Hebrews at Pithom and Rameses they were provided with straw, while subsequently the Pharaoh ordered them to go

and get straw for themselves. In the lower courses of bricks straw was actually found, but in the middle rows reed or sedge had been used,* while in the
• Cf. Duncan, The Exploration of Egypt and the Old Tntammt, p. 79.



74 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
uppermost courses the straws or reeds had withered away, but the marks in the clay testified to their former presence. The absence of actual straw in the upper rows of bricks was at first regarded as a detailed confirmation of the account in Exodus, but it is nowhere stated that the Hebrews made bricks without straw; on the contrary, they were told to go off and get straw where they could, and to produce the same amount of bricks at the end of the day. Had they made their bricks simply without straw or some other binding material, how are we to account for the additional labour implied? No doubt they wandered about in search of straw, but were perhaps only able to procure the reeds found in the bricks of the middle courses at Pithom. The other store-city, Rameses, has not at present been identified with certainty. It was at one time thought that Tanis, the ancient Zoan, represented the other site and scene of Israel's enforced bondage, but that theory has been given up in favour of one which sees the Biblical store-city of Rameses in the ruined mounds of Tell er-Retabeh. Tell er-Retabeh lies about eight miles from Pithom, and contains the remains of a fortified camp. The origin of this ancient fortress must be assigned to a date very much earlier than any of the Rameses, for stone vases, scarabs, and other relics of the ninth to the twelfth dynasties have been discovered some twelve feet below the strata, which contain the deposits of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties, while under the oldest wall there is said to have been evidence of the practice of the Syrian custom of child-sacrifice. There is certainly no evidence of the existence of



THE HEBREWS BEFORE TIIE EXODUS 75
a genuine Egyptian custom of this kind, though there is abundant proof of the prevalence of human sacrifice in Egypt from the earliest times,* the victims generally being taken from the ranks of the enemy. As civilization advanced, we should naturally expect that a custom of such barbarity would fall into desuetude, but so far was this from being the case that we find the kings of the eighteenth dynastythe dynasty under whose auspices Egypt attained the height of her power, both abroad in regard to her foreign relationships, and at home in regard to her internal development-expressing their savage sentiments under the same guise of religious piety. Thus Amenl:etep II. hung the bodies of six of the enemy whom he had slain, opposite the pylon of the temple of Amen, presumably as a thank-offering to that god, while the records of the kings of the succeeding dynasty attest the practice of the same custom. But the main grounds givent for the identification of Tell er-Retabeh with "Rameses" are(1) The Harris Papyrus refers to a city called "the house of Rameses," and states that Rameses III. dedicated a temple there to his own honour. A temple has here been excavated which would appear to owe its origin to Rameses II., and its subsequent restoration to Rameses III., the head of whose statue was found in the ruins. The recovery of a stele from the same site bearing an inscription of Rameses II., in which that king boasts that he has built " in cities upon which his name is to eternity," further suggested that this might be the "Rameses" of Exodus. (2) A line of an inscription discovered here states
• Cf. Budge, Osiris, p. 197 ff.
t Cf. Duncan, pp. I72-1 i 5.



76 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
that "Atmu, lord of Succoth, gives him all valour and strength "-an apparent indication that "Succoth" was either another name for the town, or the name of a place or district in the vicinity ; it was to this place the Israelites arc said to have journeyed after their departure from Rameses (Exod. xii. 37). (3) The inscription on a door-jamb informs usaccording to Petrie's rendering-that there were store-cities here, with a favourite court official to look after them, while, according to Griffiths' translation, mention is made of a " keeper of the foreigners of Ta-nuter" (i.e. Syria). All these points are fairly urged in support of the identification of the site with the "Rameses" of Exodus, but in themselves they hardly seem sufficient to prove it conclusively. Thus, in regard to (1) the fact that Rameses states that he set his name "to eternity" on many cities, at the outset introduces an element of uncertainty as to the specific Rameses referred to. The mention of Succoth in an inscription from this "city of Rameses" is interesting when compared with its juxtaposition with Rameses in Exodus, but it is a point which hardly admits of being pressed or used as a positive argument. The door-jamb inscription certainly seems to afford evidence that this "city of Rameses" was either used as a store-city in the one case, or if we accept the other translation, that part of its population were Syrians. Either of these statements would accord sufficiently well with the tradition recorded in the Old Testament, but they can hardly be said to actually substantiate it. Tell er-Retabeh thus may be the Rameses of Exodus, but the evidence forthcoming up to the



THE HEBREWS BEFORE THE EXOD(jS 77
present is not cogent enough to justify any dogmatic assertion of their identity. It will be seen that the evidence considered thus far does not bear one way or other on the accuracy of the Biblical account. There is, however, one outstanding factor, the significance of which has been already remarked, and that is that the tradition regarding the character of the city of Pithom, and the correct preservation of its name do not support the view that the Exodus took place about the time of the commencement of the eighteenth dynasty. Evidence has, however, been adduced in favour of this view, and may be briefly considered. It will be recalled that the Hebrew writer designates the King of Egypt who oppressed the children of Israel simply as "Pharaoh" ; but as this title was borne by every King of Egypt, it does not enablr. us to identify the king in question. The earliest mention of Israel in any inscription at present known is that found in the famous stele of Menephthah, the successor of Rameses 11., the king who certainly built Pithom, and was therefore, according to the Hebrew tradition, the Pharaoh of the oppression, the next known to us being some five hundred years later, when Shalmaneser I I., King of Assyria, mentions Ahab as a vassal in the opposing army of the King of Syria. The passage in Menephthah's inscription bearing on the exodus-problem reads as follows:-*" The kings are overthrown, saying: •Salam!' Not one holds up his head among the Nine Bows. Wasted is Tehenu (i.e. the Libyans); Kheta (the Hittites?) is pacified ; plundered is Pekanan (i.e. 'the Canaan') • Breasted, Egypt in Ancient Record,, vol. iii. p. 263,



7X THE L\TEST LlCHT ON BlULE Li\NDS
with every evil ; carried off is Askalon ; seized upon is Gezer ; Yenoam is made as a thing not existing ; Israel is desolated, his seed is not; Palestine has become a widow for Egypt. All lands are united ; they are pacified, are in peace ; every one that is turbulent is bound by King Menephthah, given life like Ra, every day." There seems to be no doubt that " Israel " is here the name of the people and not the name of a district, for it is followed by the determinative for " people," whereas Syria, Canaan, etc., are followed by the determinative for "land." Israel 1s thus here represented as being already settled in Southern Palestine, and consequently it is urged
FrG. 33.-Stalue of !11enephthah. that Menephthah clearly could not have been the Pharaoh of the exodus, but that that event must have taken place at an earlier period, and is probably to be connected with the expulsion of the foreign Hyksos kings by the native kings of the eighteenth dynasty. The adoption of this theory involves, however,



TIIE HEBREWS BEFORE THE EXCJDLiS 79
the rejection of the Biblical statements in regard to the store-cities of Rameses and Pithom, which are, as we have seen, to some extent supported by archa:ological evidence. Some scholars would identify the Khabiri of the Tell el-Amarna letters of the eighteenth dynasty with the returned Hebrew exiles ; but such an identification involves a violation of the usually observed laws of philological transmutation, and as the similarity of the names is the main argument advanced in support of this theory, it can hardly be accepted in our present state of knowledge. Much has been written on this question, and as it is one of first-class importance, it may be well to state the case here, even at the risk of introducing technicalities into a book intended for the general reader. The crucial point is whether the initial guttural in the Hebrew word for " Hebrew" can be equated with the "Kh " in the Assyrian "Khabiri." Ayin, the guttural with which the word "Hebrew" commences, has two distinct sounds, differentiated in Arabic writing, but not in Hebrew writing. Fortunately, the Septuagint, or Greek Version of the Old Testament, made by order of Ptolemy II., Philadelphus, King of Egypt from 287 B.C. or 286 to 246 B.C., generally preserves this distinction. Now, the ayin in " Hebrew" is represented in the Septuagint by a smooth breathing, which indicates that in this word it had a soft sound. It is perfectly true that the Hebrew ayin sometimes corresponds to the Assyrian kit, but in the cases cited



80 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
by Schrader• and Professor Clay t the ayin (from a comparison with the Septuagint (Swete's version)) probably had a hard, and not a soft sound, as in the word "Hebrew." :j: Probably the best example that can be cited in support of the theory that the Assyrian kit can correspond with a soft Hebrew ayin is afforded by the proper name Canaan, which, in Assyrian, is Kinnakhkhi. The ayin in the Hebrew word for Canaan would appear to be soft, as it is not represented in the Septuagint at all, only the vowel which accompanies it being represented in the Greek. The possibility of such an interchange may therefore be fairly argued, but not its probability, especially at the beginning of a word. But admitting the possibility of s:1ch an interchange, there is another consideration which renders it highly improbable in the present in~tance. As stated above, Sayce associates the khabiri-ki of the Tell el-Amarna Letters with the Biblical Hebron. Unlike the word "Hebrew," the initial guttural of the Biblical word'' Hebron" is a !teth,.or hard "h," and the Assyrian equivalent for the Hebrew heth is" kh." It is therefore probable that the Biblical "Hebron" and the Assyrian " Khabiri" are pl1ilologically related (cf. further, p. 5I). But the words " Hebron" and "Hebrew" are entirely distinct, and can under no conceivable circumstances be brought into relationsh:p. It therefore follows that if we identify the
* The Cuneiform Inscriptiow and the 0. T., i. p. 179 (2nd ed.).
t Lig!,t on tl,e Old Testament from Babel, pp. 265 ff.
t The two cases cited are Gaza and Omri : in the former the initial Hebrew ayin is represented by "G" in the Greek, while the initial guttural of "Omri" is represented by a "Z," which implies that the ayin had a hard sound.



THE HEBREWS BEl"ORE THE EXODUS 81
"Khabiri" with the "Hebrews," we must ipso facto entirely dissociate "Khabiri" from "Hebron." In short, such an identification involves the rejection of a proposition which strictly conforms to the ordinary rules of philological transmutation, in favour of one which is totally at variance with those rules, but at the same time it should be noted that though the words "Khabiri" and "Hebron" are radically connected, the identification of the place •• Khabiri-ki" with IC Hebron" is entirely hypothetical. Professor Clay presents the cas_e for the identification of the Khabiri with the Hebrews with his usual ability and clearness in Light on the Old Testament from Babel (p. 265 ff), but, apart from the linguistic objection, the acceptance of that theory in its developed form seems to the present writer to entail the repudiation of vital and matter-of-fact elements in the Hebrew record-elements, that is to say, of an historical or quasi-historical character, which the internal evidence in regard to Pithom would make one very reluctant to abandon, e,pecially as the salient parts of the story are assigned to JE, and are probably therefore not later, even in their redacted state, than the seventh century B.C. • It is, of course, perfectly true that the introduction of IC Rameses" into the story might very well be a later gloss; but Naville's conclusions regarding the builder of the granaries at Pithom on the one hand, and the obvious connection of" Rameses" with Pithorn implied in the Biblical narrative on the other, surely corroborate each other, and render a gloss-theory in this particular instance somewhat gratuitous.
* Dr. Driver holds the same ,·iew as to the general trustworthine"!oo~ of the Hebrew tradition (cf. Driver, Exodus, pp. xxx, anJ 4). G



~2 THE LATEST LIGHT ON DIBLE LANDS
The question is, what theory will accord best with the facts as at present known, with the inferences to be drawn from Menephthah's stele, and with what is known of the Hyksos on the one hand, and with the Hebrew account on the other? In the first place, it is highly improbable that there was only one exodus; it is far more likely that the Hebrews filtered back to their country by degrees, and that some of them returned, or were driven out, along with the Hyksos. It is quite conceivable that the great and final exodus, regarded by the Hebrew writer as the exodus of Israel from Egypt, and the slavery which that name had come to connote, may have taken place under Menephthah, for that king had to concentrate the whole of his attention on. the warlike Libyans, and must perforce h;-,.ve had to relax the pressure elsewhere. What more likely then that the wretched Hebrews, ground down with the inexorable demands of the indefatigable builders of the nineteenth dynasty, should make good the golden opportunity and free themselves from their slavery? We know that Menephthah's predecessor, Rameses II., was a great builder ; we know that he employed multitudes of slaves, that he erected Pithom and other store-cities in the Delta, and these facts accord well with, and to a certain extent substantiate, the traditions of the Hebrews. If this contention be a fair one, then the Israel referred to on Menephthah's stele will designate those Israelites who had returned to their native land possibly with the Hyksos, possibly later. Or, as Professor Driver suggests,* some Israelites very possibly remained all the time in Palestine, and Meneph· • er. Driver, Sc/1weich lectures (1909), p. 39.

thah's inscription may refer to the descendants of these Israelites. However that may be, Israelitish names were known in Palestine long before the time of Rameses II. and Menephthah, for in Thothmes 111.'s lists of conquests two names occur which, transliterated into Hebrew,become Jacob-eland Joseph-el. But is it quite impossible that Menephthah should be the Pharaoh of the exodus, and yet at the same time the Israel mentioned on his stele be the Israel who had fled from Egypt in the early part of his reign? There is at the present time no categorical answer to these questions, and we must confess our inability to solve the problem until further light is forthcoming. The route of the exodus• is a topic that has received its fair share of attention at the hands of scholars ; but it must be admitted that no final conclusion has been reached, and no theory propounded which has gained a general acceptance. This was to be expected from the very nature of the case, for the data at our disposal admit of much theorizing, and theories in regard to a problem of this kind can never be securely established on the platform of absolute certainty, though they may attain to the highest degree of probability. The Old Testament gives us a fairly circumstantial account of the journey, and of the various halting-places at which they pitched their tents. Some of these places have been identified with a practical certainty, while the sites of others are still a matter of conjecture.

The part of the Delta in which the Hebrews originally settled was Goshen, identified with the western end of the Wadi Tumilat. Subsequently, on the accession to the throne of a king "who knew not Joseph," they were employed in building the store-cities of Pithom and Raamses, both of which were situated in
the Wadl 'fumilat. Rameses was the starting-point of their hurried flight from the land of Egypt. Thence they journeyed to a district called Succoth, identified by most scholars with the Thuku of the hieroglyphic texts. Succoth either lay on the east of Pithom or possibly embnced Pithom within its borders. From Succoth they wended their way to Etham, which, like Succoth, is regarded by Naville, though upon doubtful grounds, as the name of a district.• Etham was "in the edge of the wilderness" (Exod. xiii. 20), and therefore somewhere near the north part of the Isthmus of Suez. Both Naville and Petrie identify Etham with the district of Aduma, the bedouin of which land, in the time of Menephthah, asked leave to cross the Egyptian frontier at the fort of Thuku
"to go to the lakes of Pithom for pasture." t The precise site is, however, quite uncertain, as the name has not been satisfactorily identified. The Israelites were next ordered to "turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth and the sea, over against Baal-zephon," and they were to encamp before it by the sea (Exod. xiv. 2).
* Cf. Naville, The Store-city of Pithom, p. 23.
t Cf Petrie, Researches in Sinai, p. 204. On the other hand, cf. Dri,·er, Exodus, p. 112. Naville and Petrie identify as in text, but the identification is very uncertain. Egyptologists in general identify Adu ma with Edom (cf. W. M. Muller, Enc. Bibi., II. 14rr n.; and cf. Breasted, Ancient Records, iv. p. 273).

the "turn " referred to would be a change of direction towards the south-west. The sites of Migdol and Baal-zephon are unknown, though, as Petrie says, there was probably a "Migdal tower on the hills behind them, and Baal-zephon on the opposite side of the gulf." Now there are reasons for thinking that, in those days, the Red Sea extended up through the Bitter Lakes as far as the modern town of Ismailiya. If this were the case, it would make the encampment of the Israelites "by the sea" intelligible. The place at which they crossed is uncertain ; possibly they forded the sea at a place to the south of the Bitter Lakes, but more probably at a place more to the north, i.e. between the Bitter Lakes and Lake Timsa~, for this part of the gulf was no doubt the shallowest, as it is now dry land..,, This is therefore the most likely place for the waters to have been blown back by a "strong east wind," and to have
thus left a dry crossing (Exod. xiv. 2I).t

Bibi., vol. ii., opposite cols. 1207, 120~), and there are statements both in Egyptian inscriptions and in classical writers which seem lo show that it did so in historic times (see the discussion in Dri\'er, Exodus, pp. 126-128; and on the other side Kiithmann, Die Ostgrmzc Aegyptms (1912)).

HE expulsion of the foreign Hyksos kings and the establishment of an Asiatic empire by the

native Egyptian kings of the XVI!Ith dynasty were



88 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIDLE LANDS
the two factors destined to mould the political situation in Syria and Palestine at the time of Israel's national birth. .Aal]mes, or Amasis I., the first king of the dynasty, had already pursued the alien usurpers into Syria, and had captured the city of Sharuhen (probably to be identified with Tel esh-Sheriah, in the tribe of Simeon, north-west of Beersheba) (cf. Josh. xix. 6).
Some years later Thothmes I. (cf. Fig. 35) penetrated as far north as Carchemish, the route which he followed being by Gaza, Megiddo, and Kadesh on the Orantes. The expedition ,,vas crowned with success, and Thothmes returned to Thebes laden with booty. His son, Thothmes II., was similarly engaged in war with Syria, but the Asiatic conquests of his grandson, Thothmes III. (cf. Fig. 36) were of a far more extensive and abiding character. Following the usual caravan route by Gaza, he arrived at Megiddo, where the allied princes had joined forces. The enemy were entirely routed, but the leaders, including the Prince of Kadesh, had sought asylum in the city. The army were, however, intoxicated at the sight of the spoil, and instead of assaulting the city, they gave themselves up to plunder. But Thothmes was bent on capturing Megiddo -" for all the kings of the country being shut up within it, it would have been as the taking of a thousand towns to have seized Megiddo "-and he accordingly ordered a blockade. Famine soon came to his aid, and the city was forced to surrender. The fall of Megiddo brought about the submission of the whole country. The booty taken comprised chariots, horses, and armour, in addition to a large number of sheep and cattle.

On his return, Thothmes ordered the names of the cities and districts which he had reduced to subjection to be inscribed on the walls of the temple

which he was building at Karnak (cf. Fig. 37). Among the places enumerated are Cana, Hazor, Kinnereth, Acre, Merom, Laish, Hamath, and Damascus. In succeeding campaigns, he consolidated his power, and established his supremacy throughout the whole of Phcenicia and Pale;;tine. He was followed by Amen}:letep II. (cf. Fig. 38),

who made no fresh conquests in Western Asia, but found it necessary to suppress an insurrection in

an e,cpedition to Syria, but it was not attended by

any important results. He was followed by Amen1).etep III. (the Memnon of the Greeks), who proved



92 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
himself to be both a shrewd statesman and an able administrator, but during the reign of his son, AmenI:tetep IV., the empire fell to pieces, and the Egyptian garrisons in Syria and Palestine found considerable difficulty in maintaining their own against the attacks of the desert tribes. A flood of light has been thrown upon the political situation in Western Asia at the time of A.menhetep III. and .A.menhetep IV. by the Tell el-Amarn~ letters. Till some twenty-four years ago our knowledge regarding the condition of Canaan and Canaanitish civilization before the time of the invasion of the Israelites was scant indeed, but in 1887 a discovery was made which, in importance and far-reaching results, can compare with the greatest achievements in archceological research. Some three hundred baked clay tablets inscribed in cuneiform characters were unearthed about one hundred and eighty miles south of Cairo, at a place called Tell el-Amarna. It was here that Amen!:ietep IV., the " heretic" King of Egypt, established his capital after his virtual expulsion from Thebes by the priests of Amen, and it was to him that the majority of the Tell el-Amarna letters were addressed. His expulsion from Thebes was due to his heretical views and to the fact that the attempted realization of his ideals brought him into immediate collision with the vested interests of the priests. His heresy consisted in a monotheistic tendency which found its expression in the exaltation of the disc of the sun to the actual exclusion of all other gods (cf. Fig. 39). The sun had been venerated in Egypt from the earliest times, but the peculiar feature in AmenI:ietep



CANAAN BEFORE THE EXODU S ~
IV.'s "new theology" lay in its implicit and explicit denial of the existence of all other gods in general ,
and of Amen, the Great God of Thebes, to whose mighty arm the pious Egyptian attributed the successful expulsion of the foreign Hyksos kings and



94 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
the re-establishment of a native Egyptian dynasty, in particular. The prominent position which Amen occupied in the Egyptian pantheon is well illustrated in the Hebrew designation of Egypt's capital as the "city of Amen." Thus Nahum, in his prophetic utterances against the Assyrian empire, scornfully asks, "Art thou better than No-Amon (i.e. Thebes), that was situate among the rivers, and had the waters round about her; whose rampart was the sea, and her wall \,·as of the sea? Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubin were thy helpers. Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity ; her young children also were dashed to pieces at the top of all the streets : and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all the great men were bound in chains" (Nahum iii. 9). The significance of Nahum's remarks lay, of course, in the recent destruction of Thebes (in 666 B.C.), and the reduction of Egypt by Ashur-bani-pal, King of Assyria, 668-626 B.C. But as the direct result of his philosophico-religious ideas, Amenl:ietep IV., or Khu-en-Aten ( = "Spirit of Aten"), as he styled himself, was more fitted for a theological chair at a university than to rule the then greatest empire in the world, and the demoralizing effect of his reign-from an imperial standpoint-is attested by the Tell el-Amarna letters. These letters, which were found in a chamber to the east of the palace of Amen9etep IV. at KhutAten near the modern Tell el-Amarna, represent what remains of the official correspondence addressed by foreign kings, by vassal-princes, and by local Egyptian governors in Palestine to· their lord and



CANAAN BEFORE THE EXODUS 95
master, the Pharaoh of Egypt. The majority of them belong to the time of AmenJ:ietep IV., but some were written to his predecessor Amenryetep III. Unlike his son, Amen~etep III. had been astute enough to recognize the necessity of securing the sup• port of the powerful priests of Amen, and he accordingly declared himself to be an incarnation of the god Amen-Ra. During his reign of thirty-six years he had consolidated the work of his predecessors, and established his empire from Ni on the Euphrates to Karei in the SCldan. In the early part of his reign he had occasion to stamp out a rebellion in the Sudan, and built a temple there to the honour and glory of himself as the god of the Sudan. He kept in constant and intimate touch with his vassals and allies in Western Asia, and made many expeditions into Syria and Palestine, while he further strengthened his diplomatic position by contracting matrimonial alliances with the daughters of foreign kings. He married a daughter of Kadashman-Bel, King of Karduniash (i.e. Babylonia); Gilukhipa, a sister of Tushratta, the King of the Mitani (a people whose territory lay in Northern Mesopotamia), and possibly also a daughter of the same king, though the daughter was probably destined to be the spouse of Amenqetep IV., as Tushratta, in a letter to Amenryetep III., refers to her as the (future) mistress of Egypt. He further married a daughter of Shutarna, another king of the Mitani. But his favourite wife and Queen appears to have been a lady called Thi. An examination of the recently discovered mummies of Iuaa and Thuua, the father and mother of Thi, has led to the conclusion that her father was an Asiatic, but that her mother was



96 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BlllLE LANDS
a native Egyptian. She was the mother of AmenJ:tetep IV., and his monotheistic views are generally attributed to the Asiatic extraction of his mother. Of course this may be so, but it must be recollected that even assuming that the father of Thi was an Asiatic, Amenl)etep IV. would be only one-quarter Asiatic, and three-quarter Egyptian. The building operations of Amenl}etep III. were of an extensive character, and attest the greatness and general importance of his reign. Probably the best-known of his architectural products is the great temple on the west bank of the Nile, called the Memnonium ; in front of this temple he erected two colossal statues of himself (c( Fig. 40), one of which was said to have emitted a soft note at break of day, but after the statue was repaired by the Roman Emperor, Septimius Severus (193-211 A.D.), its vocal powers ceased. As already stated, the Tell el-Amarna tablets comprise letters written by or to foreign kings of independent rights, and also official communications from vassals and Egyptian officials. The contents of the former class generally have reference to matrimonial bargains, and are of a somewhat mercenary character. One of the most interesting of these is a letter written by Amenl).etep III. to Kadashman-Bel I.,• a Kassite ruler in Babylonia; it commences: "To Kadashman-Bel, King of Karduniash, my brother, thus saith Amenl).etep, the great king, the King of Egypt, thy brother: 'I am well, may it be well with thee, with thy government, with thy wives, with thy children, with thy nobles, with

thy horses, and with thy chariots, and may there be great peace in thy land ; with me may it be well, with
my government, with my wives, with my children , with my nobles, with my horses, with my chariots,
H



q:,; THE L.\TEST LICHT llN BIBLE LANDS
and with my troops, and may there be great peace in my land.'" Amenl~etep then proceeds to say that he has quite grasped the purport of the King of Babylonia's remarks regarding his daughter $u!<harti. Apparently AmenJ:ictcp had desired her hand in marriage, but Kadashman-Bel was not disposed to accede to his request until he had satisfied himself as to the welfare of his sister, who had been given as a wife to AmenJ:ietep by Kadashman-Bel's father, and he had accordingly replied, "Thou desirest my daughter for a wife; but from the time when my father gave thee my sister to wife, no man hath seen her, and no one knoweth whether she be alive or dead." After further correspondence on the matter, Kadashman-Bel finally agrees to hand over his daughter to the King of Egypt: "With reference to thy request that my daughter $u~harti be given to thee to wife, my daughter Su!<harti hath now come to the age of puberty, and may be married ; if thou wilt write unto me, she shall be brought unto thee." Burnaburiash, King of Babylonia, carries on similar negotiations with AmenJ:ietep III.'s son and successor, Amenl?,etep IV., or Khu-en-Aten. In these letters Khu-en-Aten is addressed as: Napkhuria, Napkhururia, etc. They begin with the usual salutations; Burnaburiash states that he enjoys good health, and expresses the hope that the King of Egypt, his wives and his children are well, and that his country, the army, and the government are prosperous. After these preliminary remarks, he embarks on the real object of his letter. He reverts to the friendship which subsisted between their respective ancestors,



CANAAN BEFORE THE EXODLS 99
and recalls that they used to exchange presents, rather as the expression of friendship than as the result of any distinct commercial bargain. He then throws off the mask, and calls attention to the insignificance of the two manehs of gold recently received from Amenl].etep IV., as compared with the amount received by his predecessor from Amenl].etep IV.'s father. He implores him to send, at all events, half of what Amenl].etep III. used to send, and inquires the reason of this ungenerous treatment. He then feels impelled to make some excuse for his importunity, and explains that he has promised to contribute largely to the expenses connected with the temple of the god of his native land, and that he cannot escape from his obligations in the matter, and offers, as a bribe, to send Amenq.etep anything he desires of the products of his own country. He then alludes to the offensive and defensive alliance made and strictly observed by their respective ancestors, and enlarges upon the desirability of maintaining this alliance unimpaired to the mutual benefit and safety of both parties. Finally, with a view to pacifying Amen!].etep, he sends him a present of three manehs of lapis-lazuli and five pairs of horses for the same number of wooden chariots. It would appear that either Amenl].etep was rather "near," or else that Burnaburiash was somewhat grasping, for in another letter Burnaburiash makes a formal complaint that the envoys of Amenq.etep have arrived empty-handed three times in succession, and that under these circumstances he does not propose sending anything in the way of a present to the King of Egypt : "If thou hast nothing of value for me, then



1,10 THE LATEST l,l(;HT UN IIIBLE LANDS
have I nothing of value for thee." But in spite of his indignation, he has no intention of breaking off negotiations, for in the same letter he expresses the hope that there will be a perpetual peace between Egypt and Babylonia, while he apparently thinks that his chances of success will be greater if he sends a present after all, and accordingly forwards some lapis-lazuli to Amenl;etep, and other presents for his daughter, Amen!Jetep's wife, at the same time intimating that he expects adequate gifts in return. The Tell el-Amarna collection further comprises a number of letters addressed to the King of Egypt by the King of Alashia. Alashia has been identified with Cyprus, owing to the fact that Cyprus is in Egyptian called "Alas." These letters are mostly of a commercial character. They commence with the customary salutations and expressions of good-will, and then deal with various business transactions. In one of these the King of Alashia states that he is despatching his own messenger to accompany the envoy of the King of Egypt, and that he is sending 500 pieces of bronze as a present "to his brother," the King of Egypt, and begs him not to be offended at his not having sent more, because the "hand of Nergal" (i.e. pestilence) had killed all the people of his land, and he was in consequence unable to manufacture any more. The mention of the Babylonian god Nergal is interesting, as it indicates the influence of the Babylonian religion in Cyprus at this period. The writer then promises to send the King of Egypt as much bronze as he may require, and at th1; same time l:'ays that he is forwarding an ox,



CANAAN DEFORE TI-If-: EXODUS 101
two measures of oil, and runners "swifter than eagles." In another letter, the King of Alashia complains that the Egyptian envoy had not appeared before him, and he is in a state of uncertainty a~ to the King of Egypt's attitude towards him. He is accordingly despatching a special messenger with a present of IOO talents of bronze. He would further remind the king that he had previously sent a wooden couch plated with gold, a chariot decorated with the same precious metal, together with horses, garments, oil, and precious stones, as a gift to the King of Egypt. Other letters, again, are addressed to AmenJ:ietep III. and his queen by Tushratta, the King of Mitani. The contents of these despatches resemble those of the letters sent by the King of Karduniash (Babylonia) ; they refer to alliances-matrimonial and imperial-and the exchange of presents. The land of Mitani seems to have been situated in northern Mesopotamia; possibly the ivlathen which occurs in the list of conquered places inscribed on the famous stele of Thothmes III., and also the Mathena in the list inscribed by Rameses II I. on the wall of the Temple of Medinet AbC1 are to be identified with the Mitani of the Tell el-Amarna letters. In one of the best-preserved of these letter5 Tushratta recalls the close friendship which existed between his father Shutarna, and Thothmes IV., AmenJ:ietep's father and predecessor, and asserts that the alliance between Tushratta and AmenJ:ietep is ten times stronger than that of their respective fathers. He then makes reference to the letter sent by Amenhetep, and to the request which it contained-" My brother, let thy daughter be my wife and mistress of



10~ THE LATEST l.1\rl-IT ON BIDLE LANDS
Egypt." He states that he gave Mani, the King of Egypt's envoy, a cordial reception, and that he brought forth his daughter to Mani, who approved of her beauty and rejoiced for the sake of his royal master. Tushratta expresses the hope that she will be happy, and prays that Ishtar, the goddess of Mitani, and Amen, the god of Egypt, may mould her to do the will of Amenl).etep. After further protestations of friendliness and renewed asseverations of the intimacy of their joint relationship, Tushratta descends to the material, and gives free vent to his desire for gold. Needless to say, he does not require it for his own exclusive ends, but in connection with favours granted or services rendered to the King of Egypt. It appears that Tushratta's grandfather had promised to send AmenJ:ietep some articles used in war or the chase. For some reason un-named, the promise had not yet been redeemed, and it remained for Tushratta to discharge his grandfather's obligations. This he is prepared to do, but he requires gold to pay for the carriage of the goods, while he wants more gold for the ostensible purpose of providing his daughter with a dowry. Of course Tushratta does not want to offend the King of Egypt by asking for gold, but, on the other hand, he does not himself wish to be offended by being sent anything Jess than a large quantity of the precious metal. He prays that the gods may be pleased to make the gold of Egypt ten times more plentiful than it is, presumably in the hope that the amount sent by Amen}:ietep to himself may be ten times as large as it is on the present occasion. _Finally, he enumerates the gifts he is sending to Amenl).etep; they include a large golden vessel inlaid with Iapis



CANAAC'l BEFORE 'ffIE 1-:XO!Jl'S 10~
lazuli, ten pairs of horses, ten wooden chariots, and thirty eunuchs. But the most interesting letters in the collection for our immediate purpose are those sent from the vassal princes and governors in Phcenicia and Canaan, for they throw a flood of light not only upon the historical geography of Palestine, but also upon the state of civilization to which the inhabitants of Canaan had attained at this early period, and they prove that the metaphor applied by the Hebrew writers to the Land of Promise was not a mere hyperbole, but was in fact a true poetical description of the Canaanitish culture of that day-a land metaphorically "flowing with milk and honey." The excavations have not yielded much in the nature of corroborative evidence in regard to the high civilization of the pre-Israelite inhabitants of Canaan, as revealed in these letters, but the testimony of the Egyptian kings themselves bears out the inferences to be drawn from the Tell el-.-\marna correspondence. Thus, the annals of Thothmes II I.,* in their enumeration of the spoils taken from the princes of Canaan, mention chairs. tables, and staves of cedar and ebony inlaid with gold, a golden plough and sceptre, iron tent-poles set with precious stones, chariots chased with silver, rich embroidery, and various other products of an advanced and highly developed culture. Among the various officials and rulers in Palestine and Phcenicia, of whom despatches have been recoVt'red from Tell el-Amarna, we may sp,cifically mt:ntion Yapakhi, the governor of the city of Gezer;
• Cf. ~ayce, Aidao!ogyrfthr C1,m1/c1111 hwnftiom, p. 156.



TO-\ THE LATEST LIGHT ON nrnLE LANDS
Widya, governor of the city of Askelon; Abdi-Khiba, the King of Jerusalem ; Rib-Adda, governor of Byblos; and Abi-Milki, governor of Tyre. The purport of the communications of Yapakhi, governor of Gezer, is to the effect that he has carried out the instructions received by the hand of the King of Egypt's envoy, but he informs the king that he is hard pressed by the enemies of the king, and he implores Amenry.etep to take measures for the protection of Gezer and the surrounding country. In one letter he complains of the defection of his youngest brother, who has gone over to the enemy, and asks for instructions as to what he is to do. The letters of Widya, the governor of Askelon, are couched in the same submissive terms; he is guarding the city under his charge with the utmost vigilance. He hastens to send the desired gifts of meat, drink, oil, and oxen, together with the usual tribute-apparently in answer to a letter of remonstrance from the king. But the letters of the greatest interest and value to the student of the Old Testament are those addressed by Abdi-Khiba, King of Jerusalem, to his overlord the King of Egypt. Allusion has already been made to the aggressive attitude of the Khabiri at this time, and Jerusalemor U rusalim, as it is called in the letters-under the leadership of Abdi-Khiba, formed the principal point of resistance to their attacks. Abdi-Khiba seems to have been one of the few Egyptian vassals in Palestine whose loyalty was unimpeachable; but his very loyalty proved an incentive to other local governors to slander and blacken his ch:i.ra_cter in the eyes of Amen~etep.



CANAAN TIEFORE THE EXODUS roj
Thus, in one letter Abdi-Khiba expostulates* :" To the king, my lord, say also thus: 'It is AbdiKhiba, thy servant. At the feet of my lord, the king, twice seven times and thrice seven times I fall. What have I done against the king, my lord? They backbite-they slander me before the king, my lord, saying: Abdi-Khiba has fallen away from the king, his lord.'" In another letter, after protesting against the libellous statements made against him, he appeals to the King of Egypt to come and crush the widespread revolt against Egyptian rule:-" Let the king take counsel with regard to his land-the land of the king, all of it, has revolted ; it has set itself ag-ainst me. Behold, (as for) the lands of Sheri ( Seir), as far as Guti-Kirmil (Gath-Carmel), the governors have allied themselves, and there is hostility against me. Even though one be a seer, one wishes not to see the tears of the king, my lord ; open enmity exists against me. As long as ships were in the midst of the sea, the power of the mighty took Nakhrina (Naharaim) and the land of Kashsi, but now the Khabiri have taken the ·cities of the king. There is not one governor for the king, my lord-all have rebelled." In another despatch, Abdi-Khiba singles out Milki-ili and Su-ardatum as being especially blameworthy for the present state of affairs. "The men of the city of Gazri, the men of the city of Gimti, and the men of the city of Ktlti have been captured. The land of the city of Rubute has revolted. The land of the king (belongs to) the Khabiri, and now, moreover, a city of the land of Jerusalem, the city Beth-Ninip-(this is) its name-has revolted to

the people of Kilti. Let the king ... send hired soldiers. . . . And if there be no hired soldiers, the land of the king will go over to the men, the Khabiri. This deed (is the deed of) Su-ardatum (and) Milki-ili." In another letter* he says: "Behold, has not Milki-ili fallen away from the sons of Labaya and from the sons of Arzawa to ask the land of the king for them ? A governor, who has done this deed, why has the king not called him to account ?" Elsewhere, he states, "that all the lords had leagued together against him, and that Askelon, Gezer, and Lachish had supplied the enemy with provisions" ; he accordingly implores Amenl).etep "to send troops at once; there should be no postponement, otherwise next year there will be neither countries nor governors for the king (in Palestine). . . . Behold, the king has placed his name in the land of Jerusalem for ever, and the forsaking of the lands of Jerusalem is not possible." It is uncertain whether AmenJ:ietep did finally send troops, nor is it certain whether the Egyptians were ultimately expelled, or Jerusalem taken, but, however that may be, other letters afford evidence ol the further extension of the Khabiri southward, and in the latter part of Amenl}etep IV.'s reign there is no doubt that the Egyptian Government was obliged to withdraw its troops from Palestine and abandon its Asiatic Empire, an empire which had at one time embraced the whole of Syria and Palestine, including the country that lay on the other side of Jordan. (It is interesting in this connection to note that one of the letters addressed to the King of • Cf. Pinches, Old Tutament, p. 298.

Egypt is sent by "the governor of the field of Bashan.") Another correspondent of the King of Egypt was Rib-Adda, governor of Byblos, of whom twelve letters have been preserved. They attest the same disturbed condition of the political atmosphere in the north of Palestine: Rib-Adda reproaches the king for having neglected Byblos, with the damaging result that the city is now utterly lost. How is it that the king has not protected "that which belongs to his father's house"? The enemy is not merely outside, they are within the gates in the form of rebels. The King of Egypt's response to the various appeals lodged at his court generally seems to have taken the form of advice which can have hardly satisfied the requirements of the applicants, while at other times the king administers a severe rebuke to those whose loyalty is not beyond suspicion. Thus, in a letter addressed to the prince of the Amorites, the king says•:-" And behold the king bath heard thus ; Thou art in agreement with the man of Kidsa (Kadesh), food and drink together have ye supplied. And be it true, why doest thou thus ? Why art thou in agreement with a man with whom the king is on bad terms? . . . What hath been done to thee among them (the disaffected ones), that thou art not with the king thy lord?" These letters are, however, not valuable merely on account of their contents, but also because of the evidence of the pertinacity of Babylonian influence in Palestine which they afford. They show that the • er. Pinches, ibid., p. 300 f.

Babylonian language was the lingua franca of the Oriental world at this period, and that, at a time when Canaan was practically a dependency of Egypt, we not only find kings of Babylon, or of the Mitani, but also Egyptian officials and governors corresponding with their suzerain-overlord, the King of Egypt, in the Babylonian language and the cuneiform script. They also prove that there was but little difference between the language of Canaan during the century before the exodus (assuming the great and final exodus not to have taken place until the time of the XIXth dynasty), and that of the Phcenicians and of the Old Testament some centuries later. Thus in some of the letters from governors and petty kings in Canaan, the writer, to avoid any misunderstanding, adds the Canaanite equivalent of the Babylonian word which he is using, and these words are for the most part practically identical with the Hebrew equivalents of Old Testament times, while similar evidence is afforded by Canaanitish loan-words to be found in Egyptian inscriptions of the XVIIIth and XIXth dynasties. During the reigns of Tut-ankh-Amen, Ai, and Heru-em-heb, the last kings of the XVIIlth dynasty ~f Egypt, ·affairs in Palestine remained more or less unchanged, but with the rise of the X I Xth dynasty the Egyptians became once more imbued with the spirit of conquest. The reign of Rameses I., the founder of the dynasty, was marked by no very stirring events. The Kheta (or Hittites(?)) continued to grow in power, and Rameses I. found it advisable to make a treaty with Saparuru, their chief. The terms of the treaty amounted to the recognition by Rameses of the



CANAAN BEFORE THE EXODUS 109
suzerain rights of the Kheta over Northern Syria, and the corresponding recognition by Saparuru of the sovereign rights of Egypt over Phc:enicia and Canaan. On the accession of Seti I., the son of Rarneses I., Southern Syria was in open revolt, and Seti immediately set out to quell the rebellion and restore the prestige of the Egyptian government. After having reduced the rebellious southerners, Seti pushed forward to the Hittite frontier, and captured the cities of Januarnu and Kadesh on the Orontes. But this victory had no permanent effect, and Seti was subsequently obliged to treat with the Kheta on terms of equality. He was succeeded by Rameses II., the Sesostris of the Greeks and the supposed Pharaoh of the "Oppression." During the first years of his reign he was engaged with the rebellious Sudanese, and his victories in the south were commemorated on the walls of the rock-hewn temple at Bet-al-Wali. In the fourth year of his reign he had to direct his attention to affairs in Syria, where the Hittite usurper Kheta-sar had mustered his allies and threatened to put an end to Egyptian influence in Syria and Palestine. Kheta-sar's army included contingents from Carchemish, Arvad, Naharaim, and Khalupu, together with Mysians, Lysians, Trojans, and Dardanians, and natives of Girgasha and Pedasos. The army of Rameses encamped at a place called Shabtuna, to the south-west of Kadesh, while the followers of Kheta-sar lay concealed in the woods of Lebanon.* Rameses was uncertain as to the exact

position of the enemy, but two Bedawin informed him that the army of Kheta-sar was stationed at Khalupu (Aleppo), and Rameses accordingly resolved to push on to Khalupu and there confront the enemy rather than lay siege to Kadesh, and thus compel the Hittite forces to come to the aid of the city. This move was entirely to the satisfaction of Kheta-sar, who had the meanwhile amassed his troops at Kadesh
FIG. 41.-Kheta-sar and his daughter.
with a view to attacking the flank of the Egyptian army on the march. But just when the Egyptians were about to decamp, two spies who had been ordered to watch the departure of Rameses were arrested, and under torture the truth was extracted from them. He at once recalled his legions, and prepared himself for an immediate attack. After some fierce engagements, the Hittites were routed, but Kheta-sar, their chief, found asylum in Kadesh. The might and valour of the Egyptian army had clearly been taxed to the utmost, for Kheta-sar's proposal of a truce was at once accepted, and Rameses prepared to return to Egypt

(cf. Fig. 41). But the cessation of hostilities did not permanently ensure the peace and tranquillity of Palestine, and in the eighth year of Rameses' reign the whole of the Galilee district rose in open rebellion. Merom, Shalama, Dapur, and other towns had to

his triumphs had no permanent or lasting effect, and the Hittites still remained unconquered, while the terms of the treaty concluded by the two peoples definitely enjoined the renunciation of Egyptian rights over Mitani, Naharaim, Amurru, and Alashia -countries in which Thothmes III. had held undisputed sway a century or so before, and enacted on the one hand that the Kheta should not invade Egypt, and on the other that the Egyptians should abstain from making inroads into the territory of the Kheta. The boundary between the territories of the two peoples was fixed at the Nahr el-Kelb, or Dog-River, near BerO.t. Of the numerous buildings erected by Rameses during his long reign of sixty-seven years, the "Ramesseum" (cf. Fig. 44) is probably the most famous. Few of his monuments, however, can compare with the works of the great kings of the XVII Ith dynasty, and the reflection of Egypt's decadence is to be seen in the temples and statues of the period as well as in the grandiloquent lists of her triumphs.



CHAPTER IV
JSRAEL IN CANAAN
A
LLUSION has already been made to the internal weakness of the Egyμtian Empire at the ti,11e of Menephthah, signalized by the emboldened atuck of the Libydns, the Hittites, and bands of Mediterranean seafarers on the one hand, and also perhaps by the successful flight of the Israelite slaves on the other. This combined pressure inevitably weakened the Egyptian monarch's hold upon his Asiatic possessions ; and the third year of his reign* (c 1223 B.C.) found a widespread revolt a~ainst his sovereignty throughout Syria and Palestine. Askelon and Gezer, towns bordering almost on the confines of Egypt, threw off the yoke and proclaimed their autonomy ; Gezer had evidently shown some power of resistance, for Menephthah subsequently styled himself as "Binder of Gezer," as though his reduction of the place were indeed a memorable and noteworthy achievement. His subjugation of the rebellious vassals would seem to have been complete, though the only account of the campaign is that contained in one of the usual self-congratulatory p.eans of triumph. Meanwhile the Libyan hordes had not failed to • Cf. Breasted, A History of Egypt (19c6), p. 465.

make use of the excellent opportunity afforded by Mcnephthah's absence in Palestine to renew their attacks on the western Delta. These hordes at the outset were little more than an inchoate multitude, but later on they developed into an organised force. Among the allies mentioned are the Sherden or Sardinians ; the Shekelesh, who, Breasted * says, were possibly the Sikeli, natives of early Sicily; the Ekwesh, whom the same learned scholar is disposed to identify with the Ach::eans ; the Lycians and the Teresh, regarded by Breasted as the Tyrsenians or Etruscans. Menephthah, in spite of his advanced age, successfully repelled the attack, and administered a severe check to their immediate aspirations. After a short and turbulent reign Menephthah was gathered unto his fathers and was buried at Thebes. where his mummy was discovered some years ago; it was found in the to_mb of Amenhetep II., and is now preserved in the Cairo Museum. His death ushered in a period of anarchy, during which various pretenders endeavoured to establish their claims. The two most successful of these aspirants were Amenmeses and Menephthah-Siptah. The former was soon supplanted by MenephthahSiptah, the principal and at the same time most fateful event of whose reign was the appointment of one Seti as Viceroy over Nubia. Seti ultimately rewarded his benefactor after the usual fashion, by quietly sweeping him out of the way and usurping his position. Siptah was, however, more successful than his immediate predecessors, but his day was short, and the brief period of comparative tranquillity which

ISRAEL IN CANAAN I 17
Egypt seems to have enjoyed under his rule, gave place to a cataclysm of anarchical disorder, and the the country became the plaything of nobles and local potentates. As Breasted says, "The nation must have been well on toward dissolution into the petty kingdoms and principalities out of which it was consolidated at the dawn of history." The land was further smitten with famine, and misery, poverty and degradation prevailed throughout the length and breadth of the country. The Libyans, who at all times showed their capacity for seizing and making good use of any opportunity presented by the ineptitude of the Egyptian Government, carried on their predatory raids in the Delta. At about this time (i.e., c. 1200 B.c.) Setnakht, a man endowed with the qualities necessary for leadership, succeeded in gathering up the reins into his own hands, and bade defiance to his rivals. Little is known of him, and that little is due to the filial piety of his son Rameses III., who says" : "But when the gods inclined themselves to peace, to set the land in its right according to its accustomed manner, they established their son, who came forth from their limbs to be ruler of every land, upon their great throne, even King Setnakht. . . . He set in order the entire land, which had been rebellious ; he slew the rebels who were in the land of Egypt; he cleansed the great throne of Egypt.... Every man knew his brother, who had been walled in (i.e. obliged to live behind protecting walls). He established the temples in possession of the Divine offerings to offer to the gods according to their customary stipulations." Rameses 11 I. continued the work of restoration

so ably inaugurated by his father. The most notable event of his reign of thirty-one years was his military and naval victory in Southern Palestine over the Mcditerrc1nean allies. On his death another period of decadence set in, and the supreme power was gradually but surely wrested from the hands of the succeeding kings (Rameses IV.-XII.) by the all-powerful priests of Amen. Finally the work of usurpation became fully accomplished, and on the death of Rameses XII., J:IerI:{eru, the high priest, assumed the name, titles, functions and position of the King of Egypt. 13ut the high-priest kings were not successful in making their power felt in the north, and as a result another line of kings established themselves at Tanis in the Delta, and Egypt became divided into a northern and a southern kingdom as in pre-historic days. The period of this double rule does not appear to have been signalized by any very epoch-making events, and on the death of the last Tanite king of the dynasty (c. 950 B.c.), the northern kingdom passed into the hands of Shashanq, the descendant of a Libyan lord, who established himself at Bubastis in the Delta. Bubastis, the ruins of which have been excavated by Naville, is the Biblical Pi-beseth (Ezek. xxx. 17). The principal event of the reign of Shashanq, or Shishak as he is called in Kings and Chronicles, was the invasion of Palestine in the fifth year of Rehoboam, King of Judah. It was formerly supposed that this campaign was instigated by Jeroboam, and that it was directed exclusively against Judah, Jeroboam having been for some years a refugee at the Egyptian Court, and

cities situated in the territory of Israel, which indicates that the object of the expedition was the recovery of Palestine as a whole (cf. Fig. 45).



1::0 THE LATEST LIGHT ON DIBLE LANDS
This list, which Shashanq caused to be inscribed upon the walls of the new court he erected in the temple of Karnak at Thebes (cf. Fig. 45), compares somewhat unfavourably with the far more eloquent list of Thothmes III. of the XVIIIth dynasty, and at once shows how greatly the influence of Egypt had declined in the intervening centuries. The most northern place mentioned is Megiddo, the modern Tell cl-Mutcsellim, while the majority of the towns enumerated are located in the south. Among the places named are Taanach, Mahanaim, Gibeon, Ajalon, Beth-horon, Migdol, a place called "the field of Abraham," and a certain place called "Yehud of the King," which earlier scholars regarded (impossibly) as the equivalent of "the Kingdom of Judah." Jerusalem was spared on this occasion, and Rehoboam purchased her freedom by surrendering "the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house . . . and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made" (r Kings xiv. 26, 27). Shashanq did not long survive his Asiatic conquests, but gave place to his son, Osorkon I. Osorkon I. was followed by Thekeleth I., after whom Osorkon II., the contemporary of Ahab, came to the throne. Meanwhile another nation, destined to shortly become the great world-power in the Oriental world, and to ultimately reduce Egypt herself beneath her sway, had shown unmistakable signs of her coming greatness. The Assyrians, whose home lay in Northern J\lcsopotamia, lacked the inventive genius of the



ISRAEL IN CANAAN r 21
Babylonians, but they showed from the very first that they were possessed of the sinews of war. At what period Assyria became a separate state we do not know, but the foundation of the Assyrian monarchy probably took place about 2000 B.C. Of the early part of her history we know comparatively little ; the principal object which she seems to have always had in view, however, was her entire emancipation from the quasi-suzerainty of Babylonia. By the fifteenth century B.C. we gather that she had so far achieved her aim as to be able to treat on equal terms with the King of Babylon, and in the so-called "Synchronistic History of Babylonia and Assyria"• we read of the conclusion of treaties regarding the boundaries of the two states by Kara-indash, the Kassite King of Babylon, and Ashurbel-nisheshu, King of Assyria. Later on, Assyria became the more powerful kingdom, and Tukulti-Ninib, King of Assyria (about 127 5 D.C.), effected the conquest of Babylonia, removed her king into captivity, and established his own form of administration over the southern country. He despoiled the city of her treasures, and carried off the statue of Marduk from the temple of Esagila in Babylon. The fact that he. describes himself as "King of Karduniash, King of Sumer and Akkad," indicates that he actually ascended the Babylonian throne. Assyria's triumph was, however, short-lived, and some seven years after, the nobles of Babylonia

revolted, and expelled the Assyrians from their country. The immediate successors of Tukulti-Ninib carried on an intermittent warfare with Babylonia, the fortune of war sometimes favouring one side, sometimes the other. In 1100 B.C. Tiglath-pileser I. ascended the throne and extended the limits of his sovereignty on every side. He cleared Northern Mesopotamia, subjugated the "Nairi country," and reduced the mountainous Vannic tribes. He drove the Arama::an hordes across the Euphrates, and even penetrated as far as Arvad in Phcenicia. While here, he had occasion to exchange presents with the then King of Egypt, who evidently intended to exercise as much influence as he could in the affairs of Palestine. Sixty or seventy years later the Hebrews consolidated themselves into a little kingdom under the leadership of Saul and David. Even at this early period in their history the Hebrews had begun to put their faith in the broken reed of Egypt, and Solomon, as we know, contracted a definite alliance with Egypt and married Pharaoh's daughter. After Solomon's death, the kingdom was divided, Rehoboam becoming King of Judah, and Jeroboam the King of the Israelite tribes in the north. Meanwhile, the power of Assyria had been temporarily broken, and Egypt for a time became the principal factor in Oriental politics. (Reference has already been made to the invasion of Palestine and the reduction of Judah by Shashanq I. during the reigns of Rehoboam and Jeroboam (i.e., c.
950 B.C.). Cf. p. 119.) The period of Assyrian decadence, which had set in shortly after the death of Tiglath-pileser I., lasted

nearly two hundred years, and it was not till the reign of Tukulti-Ninib II. (c. 890 B.C.) that Assyria began to recover her former prestige. This monarch

invaded the highland country of Nairi, and reduced it beneath his sway. In 885 B.C. he was succeeded by his son Ashur-nafir-pal (cf. Fig. 46). Allusion has elsewhere been made to the Aram.ran hordes



1:4 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
who overran Mesopotamia as early as 1300 B.C., and established a number of independent principalities. These Aram~an princes were aided and abetted by Babylonia, and Ashur-na~ir-pal made it his first business to reduce them. In 877 B.c. he conducted an expedition into Phcenicia, during which he received tribute from Sangara, the King of Carchemish ; from Arvad, Gebal, Tyre, and Sidon, and from the Amorites. Following the example of Shalmaneser I. (King of Assyria c. r 300 B.C. ), he removed the seat of his government from Ashur to Calah, the modern Nimnid (cf. Fig. 47), where he built an elaborate palace for himself (cf. Fig. 48), from the ruins of which a large collection of sculptured wall bas-reliefs, winged monsters, bronze dishes, carved ivories and other valuable relics of a bygone age have been rescued. At this time the dynasty of Omri was reigning in Israel, and both Israel and Judah were probably the vassals of the King of Damascus, the capital of Syria, whose power Ashur-na~ir-pal's son and successor, Shalmaneser II., found it hard to break, in spite of repeated attempts, but with whom Ashurna~ir-pal seems to have cautiously refrained from entering into collision. But before the time of Omri and Ahab, the King of Damascus had clearly extended his sphere of influence and domination over the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, for Asa, King of Judah, had appealed to Syria for help against Baasha, the King of Israel. The appeal was at once responded to, and Israel was invaded, with the result that Israel as well as Judah were forced to bow to the King of Damascus.

who granted the desired help, and in return assumed the suzerainty of Babylonia. Shalmaneser 11.'s campaigns in the west have a particular interest, for it was in the reign of this king that the Israelites first came into immediate contact with the Assyrian colossus. His father, Ashur-na~ir-pal, had conquered the district in the north of Palestine, known as Patini, but he had left it to his son to grapple with the far more formidable kingdom of Damascus. Shalmaneser undertook his first campaign against Syria in 854 B.c. Having received the homage of various kings and chieftains on his way, including Sangara of Carchemish and other rulers, who had, on a previous occasion, acknowledged the authority of Ashur-na~ir-pal, Shalmaneser proceeded to match his forces against Bir-idri,• the King of Damascus. The latter met the
• The much disp'.lted problem as to the possibility of identifying the ;'"IM-idri of the Assyrian inscriptions with the Hebrew proper name Benhadad would appear to be finally solved by a recently discovered inscription of Shalmaneser II. (Berl. Mus, No. 742), which has been transliterated, translated and commented upon by Dr. Langdon. In this inscription the name of the king deposed by Hazael is given as 11•IM-id-ri (read by Delitzscb, Winckler, Zimmern and Langdon as H•Pir- (or Bir-) id-ri), which must clearly be the cuneiform equivalent for the Hebrew Bmhadad of 2 Kings viii. 7 f. Dr. Langdon's translation reads :" Salmanassar the great king, the mighty king, king of all the four quarters, the sturdy, the valiant, rival of the princes of the universe, the great kings, son of Asurnazirpal, king of the universe, king of Assyria, son of Tukulti-Ninib, king of the universe, king of Assyria, conqueror of the lands Enzi[ti], Gilziinu, ljubus[kia].

and not far from Hamath, whose king was one of Bir-idri's allies. Among his vassals or allies are mentioned the Prince of Cilicia, the Prince of the North Phcenicians, the Prince of the Arabians, and Ahab, King of Israel (cf. Fig. 49). The result of the battle of ~ar~ar is uncertain: Shalmaneser, indeed, claims a great victory for the Assyrians, and boasts that he slew fourteen thousand of their warriors, but his prompt withdrawal to Assyria, and the continuation of the power and influence of Syria in all its former greatness, have a more insistent eloquence than Shalmaneser's emphatic statements.

ISRAEL I'< CANAA'.\!
Owing to the troublous condition of affairs in Babylonia, Shalmaneser was obliged to stay his hand till 849 B.C., in which year he renewed hostilities, but no success attended his arms. The raison d'etre of the repetition of Shalmaneser's bootless efforts lay in the fact that a decisive victory over Bir-idri meant the virtual reduction of Syria and of the whole of Palestine beneath the heel of the Assyrian monarch. Ultimately Shalmaneser's persistency was rewarded, but not before the death of Bir-idri, and the usurpation of the supreme power by Hazael. Meanwhile the perpetual hostilities with which Shalmaneser kept the King of Damascus engaged, proved an irresistible temptation to Ahab of Israel to throw off the yoke of Bir-idri, King of Syria, but the attempt proved abortive and Ahab met his end in a battle at Ramoth-Gilead. Jehoshaphat, King of Judah, had been obliged to accompany his immediate overlord, the King of Israel, on this occasion, when the latter was fighting against his suzerain lord, the King of Damascus, just as he had probably been compelled to accompany Ahab when the latter had fought in the army of Bir-idri against Shalmaneser II. But a certain monument of supreme importance, referring to the time of Omri and Ahab, must here be mentioned. In 1868 a large stele of black basalt was found quite accidentally by the Prussian traveller, the Rev. F. A. Klein, at Dibon, a place situated on the east of the Dead Sea in the territory of ancient Moab (cf. Fig. 50). The inscription which it bore proved to be Mesha's own account of the revolt recorded in the Second Book of Kings, where we read that Mesha, King of Moab "was a sheep-master, and rendered unto the King of Israel an hundred thousand

wool," but that "when Ahab was dead, the King of Moab rebelled against the King of Israel" (2 Kings iii.



ISRA l·'.L IN' CA:--!AA :sJ
4, 5). The text of this stele was first generally made known to European scholars by Clermont-Ganneau. , After having described himself as the son of Chemosh, the national god of Moab, to whom he records his thanks for deliverance from Israel, "who oppressed Moab many days, because Chemosh was angry with his land," Mesha proceeds to narrate his recovery ofvarious Moabite towns taken by Omri, and states that he fortified them and took measures to ensure an adequate supply of water-presumably in anticipation of a possible siege. Most of the places mentioned are already familiar from their occurrence in the descriptions of the territory on the east of the Jordan contained in the Old Testament. Thus Medeba, which is here said to have been annexed by Omri and occupied by Israel during ~
the days of Omri and half FIG. s1.-The f:ocl ::-ieuu.
the days of his son, but to have been restored to Chemosh during Mesha's reign, occurs in Isaiah's lament over Moab-" He is gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo and over Mcdeba '



132 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
(ls. xv. 2). Nebo, which is here mentioned, is also named on the Moabite Stone, where Mesha says that Chemosh commanded him to go and "take Nebo against Israel," and how that, in obedience to the divine command, the king went forth and fought against it from break of day till noon, but that he ultimately took it and destroyed all the inhabitants. The city was, doubtless, named after the god Nebo, one of the principal gods in the Babylonian pantheon (cf. Fig. 51). The centre of the worship of Nebo was at Borsippa (cf. Fig. 52), the modern BirsNimrud, and the traditional site of the Tower of Babel. In the divine genealogy, Nebo was the son of Marduk, and on every New Year's Day Nebo (i.e. his image) progressed in solemn state from Borsippa to Babylon, which lay close by, in orcler to render homage to his divine father, Marduk, who, in turn, accompanied his son part of the way back. Nebo was essentially the god of wisdom and understanding, and the kings of Babylon, both early and late, were wont to place themselves under the protection and patronage of this deity, and they frequently incorporated his name into their own. The most familiar example of a royal name composed in part of that of the god Nebo is Nebuchadnezzar. Other Biblical names mentioned on this stele are Kirjathaim (cf. Jer. xlviii. r, 23; Ezek. xxv. 9) and Horonaim (cf. Is. xv. 5; Jer. xlviii. 3, 5, 34). In regard to the latter, Mesha narrates how that Chemosh bade him "go down, fight against Horonaim," just as Jehovah is so frequently represented in the Old Testament as having commanded his earthly vicegerent to arise, go down and capture some hostile city (cf. Josh. xviii. r), while the reason given by Mesha



ISRAEL IN CANAAN
for the erection of the high place-" because he (i.e. Chemosh) saved me ... and because he caused
,N.,,
me to see (my desire) upon all that hated me," vividly recalls the numerous passages in which the Psalmist exults in the God who has caused him to triumph



1:14 THE LATEST LIGHT ON Bll:ILE LANDS
over his enemies (e.g. Ps. cxviii. 7, "I see (my desire) upon them that hate me." As Prof. Driver has well said, "The inscription of Mesha comes nearer to the Old Testament, and illustrates it more directly than any other inscription hitherto found." The language in which it is written differs only dialectically from Hebrew and Phcenician, while the script is virtually identical with the old Hebrew script found on the Siloam inscription as well as on the Hebrew ostraka from Samaria. This script, in which possibly the earlier books of the Old Testament were originally written, differs considerably from the later Hebrew alphabet found in the Hebrew Bibles of to-day. It is therefore obvious at first glance how extremely important the study of Semitic epigraphy is for the solution of the manifold problems of textual criticism, for only the knowledge of the original script in which the Books of the Old Testament were written can enable the student to appreciate the difficulties which the early scribes had to encounter, and the mistakes in copying to which they were liable, and which from time to time they undoubtedly made. These errors are not a mere matter of conjecture, nor are they simply inferred from the internal evidence of the Hebrew text itself, but are in numerous cases both proved and explained by a comparison with the Septuagint. The Septuagint or Greek version of the Old Testament was compiled by order of Ptolemy II., Philadelphus, King of Egypt (c. 287 B.c.). The world-wide conquests of Alexander the Great had meant the introduction of the Greek language into countries where it had been hitherto unknown.



ISRAEL IN CANAAN 135
Hence it was that in Egypt, where there had existed a colony of Jews at least as early as the time of Jeremiah, Greek became the language of the day for Jew and Egyptian alike. Hebrew ceased to be a living language, and only survived as the language of the learned, and this necessitated the translation of the all-important Hebrew scriptures into Greek. Now the earliest known Hebrew manuscript of the Old Testament dates from the ninth century A.D., whereas the principal Greek manuscripts are several centuries earlier, and the internal evidence of these Greek manuscripts, in passages where they differ from the later Hebrew texts, often enables the student to arrive with practical certainty at the reading of the earlier and no longer existing Hebrew text of which these Greek manuscripts are among the earliest extant representatives. The earliest dated MS. of the Bible is in Syriac (Brit. Mus. Add. MS. 14425), it comprises the Pentateuch and was written in 464 A. D. Ahab was succeeded by his son Ahaziah, who in turn gave place to his brother Joram, both of whom were probably subject to the King of Damascus. J oram attempted to throw off the yoke of his suzerain overlord, and was wounded in battle near RamothGilead. On returning home, Joram and his ally or vassal, Ahaziah of Judah, fell victims to the revolution
of Jehu (c. 842 B.C.). Meanwhile, Hazael the usurper had established himself upon the throne of Syria, and both Hazael and Jehu were compelled to accept Shalmaneser II., the King of Assyria, as their suzerain overlord. The record of their submission to Assyria is to be found on Shalmaneser's famous obelisk (cf. Fig. 53), This monolith of black alabaster was



1_;6 THE L\TEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
erected by Shalmanescr II. in the central building at NimrQd, and is inscribed with an account of the campaigns conducted by Shalmaneser during the thirty odd years of his reign. In addition to the inscription, the four sides of the obelisk together bear twenty small reliefs, divisible into five series, each series being a pictorial representation of the tribute brought by a particular subject tribe or country. The long inscription round the top and base of the obelisk contains no
reference to Jehu, but in that portion of the text in which the events of the eighteenth year ofShalmaneser I I. are narrated, we read that the King of Assyria eaptured I 121 chariots, 470 war-horses, and the entire camp ot Hazael, King of Syria (cf. I Kings xix. I 5). The second series of relicfs gives us a repre

homage and bringing tribute to his suzerain overlord, the King of Assyria (cf. Fig. 54). The



ISRAEL IN CANAAN 137
superscription to this series informs us that the scenes refer to the tribute brought by "Ia-u-a (i.e. Jehu),
the son of Khu-um-ri (i.e. Omri)," which consisted of gold, silver, and lead, together with dishes, bowls, cups, and other vessels of gold (cf. Fig. 55). The



r:;S THE LATEST LIGIIT ON IllllLE LANDS
designation of Jehu as the "son of Omri" indicates the prosperity to which the Israelites had attained
under the dynasty of Omri, for the "house of Omri" seems to have become practically synonymous with the "kingdom of Israel." In reality Jehu was not



ISRAEL IN CANAAN 139
only not the son or descendant of Omri, but the actual exterminator of the dynasty founded by that king. In regard to the other series of reliefs depicted on this monument, the first refers to the tribute brought by Sua of Gilzani, who brought gold, silver, lead, vessels of copper, dromedaries, and horses. The third is a representation of the tribute of the land of Mu~ri, which consisted in elephants, dromedaries, buffaloes, apes, and various other animals. The fourth has reference to the payment of tribute by Marduk-aplu-u~ur, of the land of Sukhu, which consisted in gold, vessels of gold, silver, ivory, coloured raiment, and various stuffed goods. The fifth series is occupied with a representation of the payment of tribute by Garparunda, of the land of Patin, who brought gold, silver, copper, vessels of copper, lead, ivory, and urkarinu wood. After the reigns of Shalmaneser II.'s immediate successors the power of Assyria declined, and it was not till the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III. (745 B.C.) that she began to recover her former position. Tiglath-Pileser III. (or "Pu!" as he is called in 2 Kings xv. 19 and I Chron. v. 26) (cf. Fig. 56) reigned some eighteen years, during which he retrieved the fortunes of his country and extended the limits of his empire even to the borders of Egypt. His campaigns in Syria spelt disaster and captivity to the people of Israel. Ahaz, King of Judah, was threatened with an attack from the combined forces of Rezin, King of Damascus, and Pekah, King of Israel. The allies had already invaded the territory of Judah and had captured the town of Elath (2 Kings xvi. 6), and at this juncture Ahaz consulted



140 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
Isaiah as to what future steps to take. The prophet reassured him, and bade him have no fear of" these
two tails of smoking firebrands," of" the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah "



ISRAEL IN CANAAN
(i.e. Pekah)-" Thus saith the Lord God, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass. For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin ; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken that it be not a people. And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe surely ye shall not be established" (Is. vii. 4-9). But Isaiah's advice was not taken, and Ahaz appealed to Tiglath-Pileser, who, being only too pleased to avail himself of the opportunity of intermeddling with the affairs of Palestine, invaded Syria, subdued the enemies of Ahaz, and carried into captivity the Israelite tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, whose territory lay on the east side of the river Jordan. But the help of Assyria was only purchased by a complete acceptance of her suzerainty, and thus it is that on a clay tablet now preserved in the British Museum (K. 2751), on which is inscribed an account of Tiglath-Pileser's conquests and building operations, " Ahaz, King of Judah," is mentioned as one of the tributary kings (cf. Fig. 57). Numerous sculptures of this king have been discovered in the ruins of his palace at Nimrud, one of the most interesting of which is reproduced in Fig. 58. Tiglath-Pileser is here seen in the act of besieging a city with the aid of his battering-ram. The movable tower within which the ram was worked has been advanced up an artificial mound or bank. The archers behind are sheltered by large wicker shields, while in the background there is the gruesome spectacle of a number of rebels impaled on stakes. The picture vividly recalls the reassuring words addressed by Isaiah to Hezekiah, King of Judah, when



142 THE LATEST LICHT ON nIHLE LANDS
panic-stricken at the prospect of an imminent attack by Sennacherib-" Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the King of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a mound against it" (Is. xxxvii.

33). Both the "shield," the "arrow," and the "mound " here alluded to are all strikingly portrayed on this monument of Tiglath-Pileser III. Hoshea was placed on the throne of Israel as successor to Pekah, whom Tiglath-Pileser lll. put to death-" Pekah I slew. . . . I appointed Hoshea over them." Hoshea appears to have remained a

faithful and obedient vassal of Assyria until the death of Tiglath-Pileser, but on the accession of Shalrnaneser IV. he joined the anti-Assyrian party and sought an alliance with Egypt. But the extent of Egypt's active support at all times varied inversely with the profusion of her promises, and the doom of Israel was sealed. In 724 B.C. Shalmaneser advanced

against Samaria, and being unable to take it by storm he laid siege to the city. The city held out for three years but was ultimately captured in 722 B.C. In the meantime, Shalmaneser fell victim to a revolution and was succeeded by Sargon the usurper (cf. Fig. 59). Sargon is only mentioned once in the Old Testament (is. xx. I) ; and until the excavations, though

or the inaugural events or his reign, and was signalized by the deportation of more than 27,000 Israelites into captivity. They were settled in the neighbourhood of "Halah," in Mesopotamia, on the "Habor," and also in Media (cf. further p. 198). Two years after his accession, laubidi (cf. Fig. 60) ,

Sargon was furthermore the first Assyrian king to come into direct conAict with the Egyptians, who together with their Philistine allies from Gaza, sustained a defeat at Raphia, close to the Egyptian frontier. The name of the Egyptian general was Sib'i, who is generally considered to be the So to whom Hoshea sent messengers with a view to forming an alliance against Assyria (2 Kings xvii, 4), while both are probably to be identified with Shabaka (cf. Fig.

6 I), who, at the time of the battle of Raphia, had not yet usurped the throne. Sargon did not, however, follow up his victory by an invasion of Egypt, for, in spite of the superior equipment and fighting capacity of the Assyrian army, the resources of Egypt were practically unlimited, and he rightly judged that the time had not yet come for the conquest of Egypt. On his death in 705 B.C. he was succeeded by Sennacherib (cf. Fig. 62), who, like his predecessors, was engaged during the greater part of his reign on



ISRAEL IN CANAAN q7
the battlefield. Having suppressed the ever-rebellious Babylonians, Sennacherib invaded Syria (701 B.C.), and after attacking the King of Sidon and receiving the submission of the neighbouring towns, he marched south, received the submission of Ashkelon, and proceeded to attack the Philistine city of Ekron. The inhabitants of Ekron had seized Padi, the governor whom the Assyrians had set over them, and sent him to Heztkiah at Jerusalem, while, at the same time, they placed themselves under the protection and quasi-suzerainty of Hezekiah. After Sennacherib had defeated Zedekiah, King of Askelon, and razed his fortresses to the ground, he advanced against Ekron, to which he was about to lay siege when the belated arrival of the Egyptian allies led to an immediate encounter at Altaku (i.e. the Eltekeh of Josh. xix. 44) in Dan. As at Raphia, the superiority of the Assyrian arms was at once felt, and both Ekron and Altaku, together with the neighbouring fortress of Timnath, capitulated. Sennacherib next directed his attention towards Hezekiah, King of Judah, who had utilized the momentary respite afforded by Sennacherib's preoccupation at Altaku to fortify Jerusalem and reorganize the army. The active list comprised not only Jewish soldiers, but also a number of mercenaries from North Arabia. The city wall was in urgent need of repair, and Hezekiah hastened to prepare it for the exigencies of war; time evidently did not allow him to procure fresh material for his building operations, and he was obliged to demolish the surrounding houses in order to accomplish the work. The supply of water also demanded instant attention, and he constructed a



qS Tiff LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
large reservoir between the inner and outer walls of the city. The city was thus rendered strong enough
to successfully resist any ordinary attack, and Sennacherib at present refrained from marching



[SRAEL IN CANAAN 149
against the city, and determined to subjugate the rest of the country first. Mention may here be made of the renowned "Siloam inscription " discovered at Jerusalem in 1880. The inscription occupied a niche in the rock, some twenty feet from the lower end of a long subterranean aqueduct over 1700 feet long, which conveyed the water from the Virgin's Pao! on the east side of the city, under the Temple Hill, to the Pool of Siloam, at the entrance to the Tyropceon Valley. The text is mutilated, but the six remaining lines run thus:-" The boring; and this has been the method of the boring; while yet ... the pickaxe, each to his fellow, and while there were still three cubits to . . . the call of one crying out to his fellow, for there has been an excess in the rock to the right ... on the day of boring they hewed this mine, each to meet his fellow pick to pick ; and the waters flowed from the source to the pool for two hundred and a thousand cubits; and an hundred cubits has been the height of the rock above this mine." The workmen, evidently pressed by the urgency of the occasion and the imminence of a siege, had started tunnelling at both ends and had overlapped. The inscription is written in the old Hebrew characters, which differ but slightly from those found on the Moabite Stone and on the Phcenician inscriptions. The aqueduct was probably made by Hezekiah, to whose reign the inscription must, therefore, also be assigned. Having pitched his camp near Lachish (the modern Tell el-J:lesy), taken the city by assault, and received the submission of its inhabitants, Sennacherib



150 THE LATEST LIGHT Oi\ U!BLE LANDS
proceeded to devastate the surrounding country. The inscription on the bas-relief reproduced in Fig. 64, states that Sennacherib, King of hosts, King of Assyria, "sat upon his throne of state, and the spoil of the city of Lachish passed before him." While Sennacherib was encamped before Lachish, Hezekiah sent a message to him, saying: "I have offended ; return from me ; that which thou puttest on me I will bear. And the King of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah, King of Judah, three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold." He further gave him "all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house." He even cut off "the gold from the doors of the temple of the Lord, and from the pillars which Hezekiah, King of Judah, had overlaid, and gave it to the King of Assyria" (2 Kings xviii. 13-16). But Sennacherib was only momentarily content with this form of submission, while Hezekiah, on the other hand, relying on the support of Egypt, soon made an attempt to regain his independence. Sennacherib thereupon sent a peremptory message by the hand of his Rab-shakeh, the purport of which was that, if they submitted to his suzerainty, every one would be able to "eat of his own vine and ... fig-tree," and to drink of " the waters of his own cistern," but, if they refused to surrender, neither God nor man could save them from the heavy hand of his vengeance. On this occasion Hezekiah seems to have stood his ground, and the Rab-shakeh returned to Sennacherib, who had left Lachish and was battling against Libnah. According to 2 Kings xix. 9, he again



ISRAEL IN CANAAN
despatched messengers to Hezekiah with the same message and the same result.
FIG. 64.-Sennachcrib al Lachish.
Soon after this, Sennacherib marched westward



152 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
with a view to engaging the Egyptian army encamped at Pelusium, a town on the Egyptian frontier. This battle was never fought, owing to some great and unexpected disaster-probably an outbreak of plague-which overtook the Assyrian army. Thus, we read in 2 Kings xix. 35: "The angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand ; and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses." With his army thus decimated, Sennacherib returned to Nineveh. His own account of the expedition to Palestine is to be found on a six-sided baked clay cylinder (cf. Fig. 65), on which is inscribed an account of eight campaigns undertaken by this monarch between the years 705 and 681 B.C. This important inscription records the defeat of Merodach-Baladan, the King of Babylon, referred to in Isaiah xxxix. Merodach-Baladan apparently made an intrigue with Hezekiah, for we read that he sent "letters and a pre~ent to Jerusalem," the ostensible cause of this attention being that news had reached him of Hezekiah's recovery from sickness (Is. xxxix. 1). Hezekiah at once embraced the opportunity of contracting an alliance, and proceeded to show the messengers of the King of Babylon "the house of his precious things, the silver and the gold and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures; there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not." For this he was sternly rebuked by Isaiah, who significantly told him that not only would an alliance with Babylon not save him, but the day would verily come when all

laid up in store, would be carried to Babylon ; "nothing shall be left, saith the Lord" (Is. xxxix. 6). The alliance did not even serve any temporary



154 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
purpose, nor did it prevent Sennacherib from laying siege to Jerusalem. Sennacherib not only defeated Merodach-Baladan,
but also sacked the city of Babylon (689 B.C.), and deposed Merodach-Baladan in favour of Ashur-nadin



ISRAEL IN CANAAN 155
shum, Sennacherib's son. He further records his victories over the Medes, the Kassitcs, and other peoples on his eastern and north-western frontiers; his naval expedition against the Babylonian rebels across the mouth of the Persian Gulf (cf. Fig. 66), and the ultimate defeat of both Babylonians and Elamites. He concludes with a description of the palace he built for himself at Nineveh (cf. Fig. 67). The portion of the inscription dealing with his military achievements in Southern Palestine reads as follows: "I drew nigh to Ekron, and I slew the governors and princes who had transgressed, and I hung upon poles round about the city their dead bodies ; the people of the city who had done wickedly and had committed offences I counted as spoil, but those who had not done these things and who were not taken in iniquity I pardoned. I brought their

150 THE LATEST l.lGHT ON BlllLE LANDS
laid tribute upon him. I then besieged Hezekiah of Judah, who had not submitted to my yoke, and I captured forty-six of his strong cities and fortresses, and innumerable small cities which were round about them, with the battering of rams and the assault of engines, and the attack of foot soldiers, and by mines and breaches (made in the walls). I brought out therefrom two hundred thousand and one hundred and fifty people, both small and great, male and female, and horses, and mules, and asses, and camels, and oxen, and innumerable sheep I counted as spoil. (Hezekiah) himself, like a caged bird, I shut up within Jerusalem, his royal city. I drew up mounds against him, and I took vengeance upon any man who came forth from his city. His cities which I had captured I took from him and gave to Mitinti, King of Ashdod, and Padi, King of Ekron, and Silli-Bel, King of Gaza, and I reduced his land. I added to their former yearly tribute, and increased the gifts which they paid unto me. The fear of the majesty of my sovereignty overwhelmed Hezekiah, and the Urbi (a tribe in Northern Arabia) and his trusty warriors, whom he had brought into his royal city of Jerusalem to protect it, deserted. And he despatched after me his messenger to my royal city Nineveh to pay tribute and to make submission with thirty talents of gold, eight hundred talents of silver, precious stones ... ivory couches and thrones, hides and tusks, precious woods and various objects, a heavy treasure, together with his daughters, and the women of his palace, and male and female musicians." It is a significant fact that though Sennacherib here boasts that he "shut up Hezekiah like a caged bird in Jerusalem," he does not say that he took the



ISRAEL IN CANAAN
bird out of his cage; and, needless to say, had he captured his prize, he would not have hesitated to relate the fact. The information regarding the building operations of Sennacherib contained in this inscription has been considerably augmented by the recovery of another baked clay cylinder of Sennacherib recently acquired by the British Museum. It gives additional details in regard to the extent of the city and the dimensions of the royal palace as rebuilt by Sennacherib, while it also records the completion of the outer and inner walls of the city, and gives the names and positions of the fifteen city gates. Sennacherib's death, recorded in 2 Kings xix. 37--" And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia : and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead "- occurred in 681 B.C. After an internal struggle, and the flight of Sharezer to Armenia, Esarhaddon ascended the throne. The chief event of his reign was the conquest and occupation of Lower Egypt in 672 B.C.
Egypt, at this time under the FIG. 68.-Tirhakah. rule of the Ethiopian King Tirhakah (cf. Fig. 68), successfully resisted the first attack of Esarhaddon (673 B.C.), and their victory led Tyre to revolt against Assyria. Tirhakah is mentioned in Isaiah xxxvii.

Sennacherib and the King of Egypt who" came forth to make war" with him. Though Tyre was not completely crushed, she received a severe check, which considerably damped the ardour of the Egyptians. Esarhaddon was not, however, able to wreak his vengeance on Egypt at present, as the mountainous tribes on his northern frontier demanded his instant attention. Having settled matters in this quarter, he was free to match his arms against those of Egypt, but his delay in making an advance proved an inducement to Tirhakah to renew his intrigues with Syria, but apparently without success. Esarhaddon advanced through Phc:enicia and Palestine, and entered Egypt by way of the Wadi -:fumila~. The Egyptians made a stubborn resistance and disputed each step, but Tirhakah wa'> finally compelled to beat a retreat southwards. Esarhaddon wisely refrained from pursuing his enemy further, and contented himself with the capture of Memphis. On his return through Syria he set up the well-known stele of Zinjirli in commemoration of his triumph (cf. Fig. 69). Esarhaddon here (Fig. 69) stands erect, while at his feet kneel two of his vanquished and allied rivals, namely Baal of Tyre, and Tirhakah, the Ethiopian King of Egypt. Through the lips of these diminutive and submissive ex-kings, metal rings have been passed, and the cords which have been fastened to these are held in the king's left hand, a grim and effective way of representing their complete subjection. Manasseh, the successor of Hezekiah, seems to have acknowledged the supremacy of Assyria. All we learn of him from the inscriptions is that he was one of the twenty-two kings of the West whom Esarhaddon

commanded to furnish him with materials for building a palace, and who, when Ashur-bani-pal was march

160 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
Towards the close of Esarhaddon's reign, Memphis was recaptured by Tirhakah, and the expulsion of the Assyrians en bloc was threatened. The suppression of this rising was the first work to be undertaken by Ashur-bani-pal,• who succeeded Esarhaddon in 668 B.C. (cf. Fig. 70). It entailed three campaigns, and it was not till the capital city of Thebes (called" No-Amon" in Nahum) had been captured, 666_B.C., that Assyrian rule was once more established. Under Ashur-bani-pal, Assyria attained the height of her power and the zenith of her fame. In a long series of campaigns, which culminated in the sack of Susa (640 B.C.), Elam was completely subdued, and reduced to the position of an Assyrian province. The revolt of Babylonia under Shamash-shumukin, the younger brother of Ashur-bani-pal, was crushed in the same vigorous manner, and Shamashshum-ukin was burnt alive. But while Ashur-bani-pal was thus preoccupied, Egypt asserted her independence, and Gyges, the vassal-king of Lydia, similarly bade defiance to Assyria. Lydia was reduced, but Egypt retained her freedom. Meanwhile the Medes were beginning to make inroads on the eastern frontier, and by the time of Ashur-bani-pal's death (626 B.C.), the power of Assyria had greatly declined, and her doom was sealed. A few years later, Cyaxares, King of the Medes, defeated the Assyrian army and laid siege to Nineveh, but the advance and expansion of the Scythian

barbarians compelled Cyaxarcs to direct his attention elsewhere, and Assyria thus enjoyed a momentary respite. Cyaxares, however, soon reappeared on the scene with his ally Nabopolassar, of Babylon, and again

laid siege to Nineveh, "that great city." Sin-sharishkun, the Assyrian king, shut himself up at Nineveh and held out for two years, but at length, when food supplies, ammunition, and men failed, and there was no further hope, he burnt himself alive in his palace in company with his wives and his children. Such M

was the dramatic close of Assyria's history, the finality of which is so graphically described by Nahum (iii.)-" There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous ; all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee : for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?" Meanwhile Egypt had seized the opportunity afforded by Assyria's impotent condition to endeavour to re-establish her former position in Palestine. In 608 B.C. Pharaoh-Necho invaded the country, and was opposed by Josiah, King of Judah, whom he defeated and slew at Megiddo (2 Kings xxiii. 29 ; 2 Chron. xxxv. 20-24). Josiah was succeeded by his youngest son Shallum, who assumed the name "Jehoahaz " on his succession. After a three months' reign he was deposed and imprisoned by Necho, while his crown was given to his elder brother, Eliakim, who adopted the name "Jehoiakim." After having laid Judah under tribute to the amount of one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold, Necho returned to Egypt (cf. Fig.
7 1). On the fall of Nineveh, Cyaxares and Nabopolassar divided the empire between them, Assyria proper passing FIG. 71.-Scarab under the rule of the Medes, and ofNecho. Babylonia into the hands of Nabopolassar, who thus became the founder of the shortlived Neo-Babylonian dynasty. His death occurred soon afterwards, and he was succeeded by his son Nebuchadnezzar II. (c. 605 B.C.), who at the time of his father's demise was engaged on a campaign against Egypt, in which he had totally



ISRAEL IN CANAAN 163
defeated Pharaoh-Necho and his Greek and Asiatic allies at Carchemish.
The return of Necho's decimated legions through the territory of Judah must have presented a striking

contrast to his triumphal progress a short time previously, and is referred to by Jeremiah, who ironically bids them prepare their bucklers and shields, harness their horses, and prepare their coats of mail (xlvi. 3-6) -" Go up into Gilead, and take balm, 0 virgin daughter of Egypt; in vain dost thou use many medicines; there is no healing for thee" (xlvi. I 1). On news of his father's death, Nebuchadnezzar immediately returned to Babylon and was crowned king. Palestine, however, did not long remain quiet, and Jehoiakim, in reliance on help from Egypt, threw off the yoke (,. 601 n.c.). He was soon vanquished, and, according to Josephus, was p1Jt to death (597 R.C.). J ehoiakim was succeeded by his son J ehoiachin, who at once submitted, "and went out to the King of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers." All the principal people of Jerusalem, together with a number of" craftsmen and smiths," were removed to Babylon (2 Kings xxiv. 12 f.), while the rule of the remainder was vested in J ehoiachin's uncle Mattaniah, who took the name of Zedekiah. But Zedckiah soon exhibited the same lack of statesmanship as his ancestors, and in reliance on support from Egypt raised the standard of revolt. The siege of Jerusalem was commenced in the ninth year of Zedekiah. Apries (Hophra), King of Egypt, sent an army to the aid of his discomfited ally, but it only served as a temporary diversion, and the city ultimately fell. Zedekiah escaped, but was captured in the plains of Jericho and brought to Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah. A holocaust having been made of the royal princes and other grandees,



ISRAEL IN CANAAN 165
Zedekiah's eyes were put out (cf. Fig. 74), and he was despatched in chains to Babylon, whither the flower of the population were also carried (586 B.C.). Nebuchadnezzar's successors were weak sovereigns, and the meteoric empire which Nebuchadnezzar had reared with such energy soon began to crumble.
FIG. 7J. -Sphinx of Pharauh-!Iophra.
In the reign of Nabonidus, the last king of the dynasty, Babylon itself was placed under the command of I3elshazzar, the king's son. The most interesting and luminous reference to Belshazzar in Babylonian records, is that contained on four baked clay foundation-cylinders of Nabonidus discovered at Mu~eyyer (Ur). The text which commemorates the rebuilding of the temple of the moon-god at Ur by Nabonidus, concludes with a prayer to the same god on behalf of himself and Belshazzar his eldest son. After having petitioned the god to set the.: fear of his "exalted godhead" in the hearts of the Babylonians, "that they sin not" against that exalted godhead, and having further prayed that they may "stand fast like

fear of thine exalted godhead, so that he may commit no sin, and may be satisfied with the fulness of life." In regard to his private affairs, we learn from one inscription that he purchased some land in the first year of Nabonidus; from another we gather that in



ISRAEL IN CANAAN
the eleventh year of Nabonidus a certain lddina-Marduk owed him 20 mana of silver for goods received. Other inscriptions again refer to various offerings made in the temple at Sippar on his behalf. On the 16th of Tammuz, 538 B.C., Gobryas, the general of Cyrus, King of Anshan, entered Babylon, and it is stated that, on the IIth of Marchesvan, Gobryas . . . did something, and that the son of the king (i.e. Belshazzar) died. This passage doubtless refers to the attack recorded in Daniel v. 30-" In that night was Belshazzar the King of the Chalda!ans slain." From this date down to the time of Alexander the Great, Babylonia remained under Persian rule.
NOTE.
The theory that the Decalogue was originally written in cuneiform has been put forward by Dr. Jeremias • and has been advocated by other scholars, some of whom consider that the supposed cuneiform original was Hebrew, others that it was Babylonian in language as well as in script. The argument is mainly based on the fact that cuneiform was lhe script used in all diplomalic correspondence in Palestine in the middle of the second millenium B.c., that the Pentaleuch contains expressions similar lo those found in Babylonian, and that it readily admits of translation into Babylonian. The "Mosaic" literature is, however, not diplomatic in character, and the existence of similar expresssions in two kindred languages is merely what one would expect, as has been pointed out by the scholars cited below. Prof. Naville, in support of the comparison of the burial of records in the foundations of Egyptian temples with the "finding of the Law" (2 Kings xxii. 3), argues that Deuteronomy (which is generally believed to be the book of the law discovered in the House of the Lord in the reign of Josiah (cf. 2 Kings xxiii. 3)) had been deposited in the walls of Solomon',
• Cf. Das alte Testament in Lichte des a/Im Orimts, p. 263 (quolecl by Naville).

temple, and that its date, therefore, cannot be later than the time of Solomon, while he further expresses the opinion• that "Moses wrote in Babylonian cuneiform those books which arc nllributed lo him, and of which he is the probable author." The legitimacy of the comparison with Egyptian custom, and also in part of the conclusions drawn in regard to the supposed cuneiform originals of the Pcntateuch, is upheld

CHAPTER V
THE CAl'TIVITIES, AND AF fEI{

HE political, social, and religious conditions under which the Jews lived during their exile in Babylonia may be inferred from the contemporary writings of Jeremiah and Ezekiel. From these we gather that their lot was not that of a people crushed beneath the heel of a tyrannical and oppressive taskmaster, but rather that of a tribe enjoying full religious and personal liberty so long as they showed no signs of rebellion against their suzerain overlords. The flower of the Jewish nation had been deported and detained by Nebuchadnezzar for purely political purposes, and provided that those purposes were achieved, Nebuchadnezzar had no intention or inclination to interfere with the individual or collective rights of the vanquished. Thus it is that Jeremiah, whom the miserable remnant of discontented Jews had forcibly carried away to Egypt, where they sought asylum from the Babylonians, bade his compatriots in Babylon '' build houses and dwell in them, plant gardens and eat the fruit of them," and "seek the peace of the city whither I (i.e. Jehovah) have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the Lord for it; for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace" (c( J er. xxix. 5,



170 THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
6 ff), and it is obvious that such directions would not have been issued had the existing conditions rendered their fulfilment a total impossibility. The same remark holds good in regard to the practice of their religion. It is true that the reported edict of Nebuchadnezzar enjoining every one to fall down before the golden image" that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up," would appear at first sight to indicate an attempt to suppress the religion of the exiles in favour of the local Babylonian cults, but in reality the required act was but the outward and visible acknowledgment of Babylonian suzerainty, a suzerainty which Jeremiah himself had urged the Jews to accept, as being the will of Jehovah (Jer, xxix. 4). The temple indeed was no more, and burnt offerings and sacrifices could no longer be offered as the outward and visible sign of Jewish piety and devotion, but the spirit of Judaism was not dead nor even dormant, and the religious aspirations of the faithful found satisfaction in offering the more acceptable sacrifice of prayer, and without doubt the synagogue, which has been the centralizing and unifying influence of Judaism for so many centuries, owes its origin to the penitent exiles of Babylon. But in spite of all this, the demoralizing tendency of surrounding idolatry and unbridled luxury made a marked impression upon the more worldly-minded of the domiciled aliens, some of whom lapsed into idolatry, while the general indifference to the claims of Judaism among the" upper ten" of Jewish society was subsequently made manifest in their reluctance to avail themselves of the permission granted by Cyrus to return to their native land.



THE CAPTIVITIES, AND AFTER 171
The inauguration of Persian sway in the land of J udah's captivity marked the beginning of the last phase in the dramatic history of the pre-Christian Jews. The reign of Cyrus (cf. Fig. 75.> was characterized by a clemency seldom exhibited by the
!'JG. 75.-Cyrus Lhe Acha,menian.
monarchs of Oriental antiquity, a clemency which accrued to the benefit of the Jews as well as to that of the other subject peoples, but their satisfaction was not as entire as might have been expected, chiefly owing to the fact that the Jews had long cherished



ti~ THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
the hope of seeing their Babylonian overlords crushed beneath the heel of a ruthless conqueror. But the policy of Cyrus was dictated by the considerations of State interest rather than by any personal inclinations of his own ; history has abundantly proved that a despotic rule can at best be but short-lived, and a large and varied population can only be kept in subjection for any length of time so long as they are permitted to live under conditions which do not perpetually cry aloud for redress, and Cyrus recognized this fact and shaped his policy in pursuance thereto. Before his time, the foreign monarchs with whom the Jews had come into immediate contact were, for the most part, either harsh tyrants or else deceptive allies, but Cyrus could afford to be generous, and his generosity is an incidental testimony to the completeness of his victory. Both the Babylonians, who had been the immediate victims of his attack, and also the Jewish exiles, enjoyed the sunshine of his benevolence, and were allowed a free hand in the exercise of their religious obligations and the gratification of their religious propensities. Hence the prophet describes him as an "anointed" king (Is. xiv. I), and as the "shepherd" of the Lord (xliv. 28). In the first year of his reign (2 Chron. xxxvi. 22) Cyrus made a proclamation to the effect that he had been charged by Jehovah "to build Him a house at Jerusalem," and at the same time bade the people of Jehovah "go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel which is in Jerusalem." The actuating cause which is ascribed to Cyrus for this act of piety is that "the Lord God of heaven hath given me (i.e. Cyrus) all the kingdoms of the earth," but Cyrus himself claims



THE CAPTIVITIES, ANT> AFTER r73
Marduk the supreme god of Babylon as his patron, and in the cuneiform account of his conquest of Babylonia, perpetuated on a baked clay cylinder, he informs us that "He (i.e. Marduk) sought out a righteous prince, a man after his own heart, whom he might take by the hand ; and he called his name Cyrus, King of Anshan, and he proclaimed his name for sovereignty over the whole world. The hordes of the land of Kutu he forced into submission at his feet, and the men whom (the god) had delivered into his hands he justly and righteously cared for. And Marduk, the great lord, the protector of his people, beheld his good deeds and his righteous heart with joy. . . . Without battle and without fighting Marduk made him enter into his city of Babylon ; he spared Babylon tribulation, and Nabonidus, the king who feared him not, he delivered into his hand." The conquest of Babylonia by a foreign prince is thus regarded as the direct consequence of the native king's impiety, an impiety specifically displayed in the neglect of Marduk's shrines.* But the success of Cyrus in reality lay in the diplomacy of a statesman who can "be all things to all men," and who is wise enough to acquiesce in the wishes of his subjects in so far as the gratification of those wishes does not imperil the integrity of the empire. The leader of the homeward-bound Jews is variously called Zerubbabel or Sheshbazzar. It would appear that Cyrus facilitated the restoration of J udah's prestige and the reconstruction of Jehovah's desolated shrine in every way possible. He entrusted

their leader with the sacred vessels which Nebuchadnezzar, his Babylonian predecessor, had taken away from the depleted sanctuary of Israel's national God ; Tyre and Zidon were laid under contribution to the rebuilding of the temple, as in the days of Solomon ; but in spite of the royal patronage, the final result compared very unfavourably with the pre-exilic temple of Solomon, and "many of the prie£ts and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, \\·hen the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice" (Ezra iii. 12). But the work, thus inaugurated with such promise, was destined to become the victim of that common heir to prosperity, internal jealousy resulting in external friction. Soon after the commencement of the building operations at Jerusalem, the inhabitants of the Persian province of Samaria, some of whom were the descendants of the foreign settlers introduced by the Assyrian kings Sargon, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbani-pal, while others were genuine Israelites, made overtures to the returned exiles, and asked leave to assist in the building of the new temple. This advance was not cordially received, and the J udceans urged that the Samaritans had forfeited the rights of true Israelites by reason of their intermarriage with heathens, while at the same time they pointed out that the Persian decree only had reference to themselves, and on these two grounds they declined to avail themselves of the help thus proffered. Thereupon the thwarted Samaritans left no stone unturned in their endeavour to bring about a cessation of the work ; on the one hand they showed active opposition

(Ezra iv. 4), and on the other they misrepresented the Jud~ans to the Persian authorities (Ezra iv. 5).
Success attended their insidious efforts, and the work which had beep .i.naugurated with such promise, and

not resumed till the accession of Darius I. In the meanwhile the temporary check had considerably cooled the ardour of the faithful, and their zeal was turned into apathy, an apathy from which the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, after many strenuous endeavours, finally succeeded in arousing them. Thus it was that after a lapse of some fifteen or sixteen years, in the second year of Darius (520 B.c.), the
unfinished temple of Jehovah was once again taken in hand, and was completed and dedicated at the close of the sixth year of that king's reign (£.e. 516 D.C. ). Darius died in 485 , and was succeeded by Xerxes, or "Ahasuerus," as he is called in Esther and elsewhere. In his reign the ever-present demon of discord once more asserted itself, and complaints against the Jud~ans were again lodged at the Persian court, though, if the story of Esther might be regarded as an index to the success of these manreuvres, the Persian arm was not this time wielded in the cause of the agitators.

The particular evil which threatened the dissolution of Jewish nationality and the consequent dissipation of all the Messianic hopes , was the practice of intermarrying with for eigners, a practice which had become rife among the restored exiles.

O is JUnsdiction, and instead of con- xerxcs r. fining his energies to the revival of ecclesiastical obligations, and the inculcation of the precepts of the Mosaic Law, he proceeded to rebuild the city-wall of Jcrusalem, but the project was not realized, and the Samaritans, who had on a previous occasion obtained the ear of the Persian court, and thereby put an end to the building operations in progress at Jerusalem, adopted the same methods now, and thus once more frustrated Jewish aspiration. But their success was only transient, and after the lapse of a few years, Nehemiah, one of the cup-bearers of the Persian monarch, procured the reversal of the decree issued to Rehum and Shimshai, and obtained permission to resume the building of the city. In the teeth of Samaritan opposition the work was duly accomplished, and every effort was once more made to revivify the Law as a potent factor in the life of the nation. In 433, Nehemiah left Jerusalem and returned to the Persian court. The length of his absence is somewhat uncertain ; suffice it to say that on his return, he found it necessary to check various abuses which had grown up in his absence. The Temple had been desecrated

and its services neglected, and Nehemiah immediately proceeded to cleanse the Temple, and to carry out other drastic reforms. His success was more complete than that of Ezra, owing to his superior authority and to the more statesmanlike qualities which he possessed, but in spite of this fact the name of Ezra was destined to occupy a more prominent place in the annals of Judaism than that of Nehemiah, and this was due to the importance attached to the Law, with the exposition of which Ezra remained for all time so intimately associated in the minds of the faithful. There is little material to afford us information regarding the relationship sub£isting between the Jews and the Persian court during the reigns of Artaxerxes I.'s immediate successors, but there is at least one noteworthy event to record, occurring in the reign of Artaxerxes II. (405-358 B.C.) or III. (358-337 n.c.). According to the historian Josephus,* Joshua the brother of John the then High Priest, endeavoured, with the help of the Persian general Bagoses, to supplant his brother and usurp his office. In the course of the struggle, John slew his brother, and thereupon Bagoses forced his way into the temple, imposed a tax upon the Jews for every victim offered in sacrifice to Jehovah, and punished them for seven years. But the Persian domination was nearing its appointed end, and in the reign of Darius III. (335-330) Alexander invaded Persia and brought the Persian empire to an end. Alexander died in 323 B.C., and his empire was divided among his generals, Egypt falling to Ptolemy I., and Syria to Scleucus I. With the other

divisions of the empire, the returned exiles were not concerned, but Syria and Egypt were destined to exercise a more or less baneful influence on the fortunes of restored Judaism. Ptolemy I. is said to have treacherously entered Jerusalem on the sabbath day. Notwithstanding this, however, the Holy City seems to have enjoyed a period of tranquillity under his reign-while it was under his successor, Ptolemy I I., that the Greek version of the Old Testament, known as the "Septuagint," was compiled, but in the reign of Ptolemy IV. this temporary respite was succeeded by a period of disturbance in which the Jews became the shuttlecock of Egypt and Syria alternately. Finally, Ptolemy IV. subdued his opponent Antiochus III. and occupied Jud.ea, but Scopas, the general of his successor Ptolemy V., sustained a defeat at the hands of the same Antiochus, to the infinite satisfaction of the Jews, who appear to have hailed his advent to Jerusalem as the herald of restored liberties. But their newly kindled hopes were soon dissipated, and Judrea continued to be but a pawn on the Oriental chess-board. Antiochus met his death in I 87 B.C., and was followed by Seleucus IV. ; Seleucus, carrying on the traditions of his forbears, despatched his chancellor Heliodorus to J erusalern, with orders to appropriate the treasures of the Temple, but the latter is said to have been deterred from his enterprise by an apparition and to have returned with his mission unaccomplished. However that may be, Heliodorus subsequently murdered Seleucus, and Antioch us Epiphanes ascended the throne ( 17 5 B.C.). His reign was signalized by a series of persecutions and massacres such as the Jews had never experienced

before. His attempt to Hellenize them met with a certain amount of success, backed as it was by the irresistible argument of superior strength and the determination to use that strength without fear or scruple. The Books of the Law were destroyed, and the Temple was desecrated, while every effort was made to suppress the Jewish religion and the observance of her time-honoured rites. But the purifying furnace of affliction gave birth to a great national revival, associated with the name of "Maccabees," of which the actuating and unifying principle was devotion to the Law. The Maccab;:ean period falls outside the general period covered by this volume ; suffice it to say that, after a series of struggles, in which the brothers Judas, Jonathan, and Simon Maccab::eus played the leading parts, the Jewish people finally regained their national independence (143-142 B.C.). The recovery was, however, but the momentary rally of a dying man, and after sundry attempts to protect herself behind the bulwarks of Rome, Jerusalem shared the fate of others, and became an insignificant part of a Roman province (63 B.C.). As has been already indicated, only a part of the Babylonian exiles availed themselves of the permission accorded to them by Cyrus and his successors to return to their native land, many of the wealthier and more influential of their fellow-countrymen preferring to remain in a country of which the commercial possibilities were so infinitely superior. Till a few years ago we knew practically nothing about the Hebrews domiciled in Babylonia during the Persian period, beyond what may be gathered from the pages of the Old Testament, but thanks to

the excavations carried on by the University of Pennsylvania on the ancient Babylonian site of Nippur, several hundred contract-tablets belonging to this period have been recovered by Dr. Haynes, and published by Professor Hilprecht and Dr. Clay.* The importance of these tablets in regard to Biblical science lies in the information which they afford concerning the social habits and customs of the people with whom the Hebrews in Babylonia were in daily contact. The tablets referred to were discovered at a depth of twenty feet below the surface of the mound, in a small room eighteen feet long and nine feet broad, which turned out to be the archivechamber of the banking firm of Murashu Sons. This firm carried on business during the reigns of Artaxerxes I. (464-424 B.C.) and Darius II. (423-405 n.c.), and during the early half of the reign of Artaxerxes II. More than seven hundred tablets were brought to light, most of which were well preserved and very carefully inscribed in cuneiform. A large number of them further bore an Aramaic t inscription (or "endorsement" written in Aramaic characters), which in some cases purports to give a brief description of the contents of the cuneiform document, while in others it merely gives the name of one or other of the contracting parties. The natural raison d'etre of these Aramaic endorsements or '' dockets," as they have been called, is that

Aramaic was the language spoken by the Murasht'\ family, while custom required that the documents themselves should be drawn up in the Babylonian language and the cuneiform script, for Babylonian 1rnuld appear to have been the literary and legal language of the country down to about the third century n.c. \Ve infer, however, that Aramaic was the language of diplomacy and commerce even as early as the time of Sennacherib, for it will be recollected that Eliakim, one of the officials of Hezekiah, requested the emissary of the Assyrian king to conduct his conversation in the Aramaic tongue, and not " in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall" (2 Kings xviii. 26), while a number of contract-tablets belonging to the same time and bearing Aramaic endorsements have
also been discovered. Again, twelve * of the bronze lion-weights from Nineveh, inscribed with the names of Shalmaneser, Sargon, and Sennacherib, and belonging therefore to the eighth and seventh centuries n.c., have Aramaic as well as Assyrian inscriptions, while cylinder-seals t bearing Aramaic inscriptions and belonging to the same period have also been recovered from the ruined mounds of Assyria. Weights bearing bilingual inscriptions have further been discovered in Palestine. One of these (said to have been found at Kerak, the old Kir Moab) is published by Rene Dussaud in the Revue Arc/1toloxiq11e (1908, pp. 353,354 ff.). The object in question is made of terra-cotta, weighs 8 I grammes, and has the form of a lion. One of its sides bears a bilingual inscription (Assyrian and Aramaic) and

reads: " Palace of ... King of Ashur. One mina of the king," while below, in Phcenician characters, are the words "mina of the king." A similar terra-cotta weight(?), discovered in Palestine and bearing an Assyrian and Aramaic inscription, has been published by Vincent in the Rrv11r BiUique (1901, p. 579). These inscribed weights show that at this time (z'r. c. the eighth century n.c.) weights conforming to the standard of the Assyrian royal mina were in use in Palestine, while they also afford evidence of the use of Aramaic as the medium of commerce at this period. In later times, as we have seen, Aramaic was still the medium of diplomacy, and thus it is that we read that the letter despatched by Bishlam and his co-agitators to Artaxerxes was written in Aramaic (Ezra iv. 7). Eventually Aramaic writing ousted cuneiform _altogether, its triumph being perhaps partly due to the simplicity ofthe alphabetic script as compared with the complexityofthe Babylonian syllabary, but principally to the West Semitic element in the Babylonian population, and the long use of Aramaic as the language of diplomacy and commerce. The various types of nationality to be seen in Babylonia at this period may to some extent be gauged by the fact that one-third of the proper names in the Murashu tablets are foreign. Some of these names are wholly or partially Hebrew in origin, just as some of the names in the lists of Hebrews contained in Ezra and Nehemiah are Babylonian (e.l{. Zerub-babel)-a fact which may be accounted for by the practice of intermarriage which had grown up, and which Nehemiah sought to repress. Of the long list * of Hebrew

l~O THE L,\TEST LIGHT ON nrnLE Li\N DS
names occurring in the Murashu tablets, many are said to have their equivalents in the Old Testament, ,0 .g. Ahab, Samson, Solomon, Naboth, etc. Among other foreigners whose presence in Babylonia has been inferred from the proper names which occur in these tablets, Ammonites, Hittites, Tibarenians, Moabites, Egyptians, and perhaps even Indians* may be specifically mentioned. As might be expected, the Murashu tablets are only concerned with business transactions, and comprise leases of realty and personalty, mortgage deeds, promissory notes, and various commercial negotiations ; but there are other tablets belonging roughly to the same period, which relate to the law of husband and wife, and contain marriage and dowry contracts or provisions for a divorce, while sales, partnerships, and bankruptcies are the subject-matter of others. The same greed for gold would appear to have been the dominating factor in the Oriental breast in those times as it is to-day, and the interest on loans sometimes amounted to as much as fifty per cent. Those tablets which contain the terms of contracts bear the names of witnesses accompanied by their seal-impressions or thumb-nail marks. In one interesting document translated by Clay we learn that one Ribat leased certain fish-ponds from Bel-nadin-shum, the son of Murashu, and agreed to pay one-half of a talent of refined silver for the year's rent, and also to provide the lessor with fish for his table every day.t The names of the six witnesses and the scribe who drew up the document follow,

together with the seal-impressions of five of the witnesses, one of the seal-impressions being that of RimClt Ninib, son of Murasht,. As already indicated, some of these tablets contain agreements for the letting of houses ; the terms of house-leases generally requiring the lessee to keep the walls and roof in proper repair and to replaster them when and where necessary, while the rent seems to have been payable monthly. There arc also contracts for the hire of cattle, or for the gathering of harvest, with a penalty attached in the event of the work not being completed to time; others again are partnership-contracts, in which, for example, one party agrees to provide the land and seed, while the other undertakes the labour. Some of the tablets are concerned with the practice of bailment and embody the recognizances into which the bailor has entered; thus in one case a certain lllindar goes bail for Iddin-Bel, son of Akhu-iddina, and thereby obtains his release from prison. The amount payable by Illindar, in the event of the prisoner's disappearance, is one mina of silver. Another most interesting document also published and translated by Dr. Clay, embodies the terms of settlement of a claim for damages out of court. A son of Murashu and his bondservant had committed a trespass, and the plaintiff duly set out his statement of claim; the defendant promptly denied the alleged damage, but he nevertheless agrees to compensate the plaintiff, who thereupon withdraws. From the foregoing remarks it will be at once seen that the instinct for trade and commerce 11·hich gained for the Babylonians of antiquity such a widespread reputation, did not die out in Babylonia

with the passing of the last native Babylonian king. But although the MurashO. tablets and other cuneiform inscriptions afforded us some information regarding the conditions of life under which the Hebrews domiciled in Babylonia lived, there was little in the nature of authentic contemporaneous evidence in regard to the fortunes of the Jews who
fled with Jcremiah into Egypt. The lacuna has been to some extent filled in by the discovery of a number of Aramaic papyri, which throw a flood of light upon this comparatively obscure period. The first of these Aramaic inscriptions was dis
covered by Professor Sayce * in 1901, in the Island of Elephantine. (The Island of Abu, or Elephantine, is situated almost opposite to Assuan, and in the earliest times formed the southern boundary of Egypt.) Shortly after this epoch-making discovery, Mr. Robert Mand procured several Aramaic papyri unearthed at the same place, while Lady William Cecil obtained possession of a number of others. These, together with one or two papyri belonging to Professor Sayce, were edited by the latter with the co-operation of Dr. A. E. Cowley in 1906. These documents, which date from 47 1-4 I I B.C., and which deal chiefly with the negotiation of loans, marriage contracts, divorce suits, and other legal matters, have been translated by Dr. Cowley, and prove that there was a well-organized Jewish settlement at Elephantine in the fifth century n.c.

The importance of these documents at once attracted G~rman and French explorers to the site of their discovery. The distinguished French scholar, M. ClermontGanneau, conducted excavations there on behalf of the French, but the results of his work have not yet been published, while Professor 0. Rubensohn was selected as the German excavator, and commenced operations in 1906. A large number of papyri and ostraka or inscribed potsherds were brought to light, together with a quantity of pottery. The discoveries made by Profesor Rubensohn between the years 1906 and 1908 have recently been published under the editorship of Professor Sachau, of Berlin. The inscriptions are written in Aramaic, like those previously published by Sayce and Cowley, and they cover the period from 494 to 404 B.C, We have already had occasion to note that the Aramaic dialect can be traced at all events as far back as the eighth century B.C., while the later Aramaic characters represent the stage of transition from the early Hebrew characters-which were practically identical with early Aramaic, Phcenician and Moabite-to the late square Hebrew characters, of which we have evidence soon after the Christian era. They have been used continuously since.* It has thus been held that the presence of Aramaic words in the books of the Old Testament (e.g. in Isaiah or Psalms) does not, as has been supposed, indicate a post-exilic date for the passages in which they occur.

\Ve require, however, some adequate explanation for the occurrence of such words in each particular case, beyond the mere fact that Aramaic was the language of diplomacy at the time, for in the absence of such explanation the sudden and unaccountable introduction of Aramaic words, phrases or modes of speech into a chapter or passage which is written in pure Hebrew argues either that such Aramaisms were, as a matter of fact, inserted later, or, if original, that the whole passage belongs to the period of transition, i.e. the period in which Hebrew and Aramaic were vying with each other for the ascendency in the field of literature, and that period was certainly later than Sennacherib.* Each case must be tested on its own merits and be considered in relation to the internal evidence of the context, but the general rule still applies, and the spasmodic introduction of Aramaisms (especially late Aramaisms) into Biblical passages written in pure Hebrew, d priori and in the absence of some positive and satisfactory explanation for their introduction, must be n:garded as betokening a late date for the passages in which they occur. The Jews of Elephantine were clearly of an enterprising character, many of them being engaged in trade as bankers and money-lenders,t while one of them had at some time been a Persian official-a "/zandi::; in the citadel." They avoided intermarriage with their foreign neighbours, but at the same time displayed no religious intolerance, while in legal oaths both Yahu

• The ineffable name "Jehovah," or more correctly "Yahveh '' (Hebrew was only vocalized at a later date, and as lhe pious ne,·er
pronounced lhe sacred name, but read 'adonai ( = "my lord") in its place, the later scribes placed lhe vowels of 'adonai under the four consonants Y H V H ; the form "Jehovah " is thus a corn Lination of the consonants of one word and the vowels of another), is supposed to have been known in an abbreviated form as early as the lime of Khammurabi.1 Thus, in a tablet of that period, the name "Ia-u-um-ilu"
(= "!au " is God), occurs, this being probably the cuneiform equivalent of lhe Hebrew "Jo-el,"' and on tablets belonging- lo the Kassile period (c. 1500 ll.C.) Dr. Clay has found the names Ia-u-a, Ia-a-u, Ia-ai-u, and Ia-u-tum,' while on a letter disco,·ered by Sellin at
Ta'anek, and written about 1450 n.c., lhe name Akhi-ya-mi ( (?) = the Biblical "Ahijah," meaning "Yah" (or "Yahu ") is my brother) occurs. However that maybe, we have ample evidence to show that the name u lau,,, or "Yau," was known among the Babylonians during the period from 2000 to 1400 n.c. It is thus clear, that the name" Iau," "Yau, 11 or" Jo," came to Israel from outside. Professor Rogers follows Stade and other scholars in Lhinking that the tetragrammaton itself was imported from the Kenites, among whom i\loses resided for some time and with whom Israel, or al all events Judah, were closely allied. There is, of course, no doubt that the short "Jo" in Jo-el, Jonathan, etc., and the tetragrammnlon both designate Israel's national God, but whether they are really connected in origin is a questionable matter. 4
It seems probable that Yak, or "Jah," is an abbreviated and there

' The "Jo-" in Hebrew is generally supposed to = "Jeho-" (cf. "Jo-nalhan" and" Jeho-nathan ") and to be abbre,·iated from "Yahveh" and therefore of later origin. But the disappearance of the central "h" and the very early evidence for the short form "Iau," etc., are against this view. 3 On this form cf. Daiches, Zeit.f,,r Ass., 1908, pp. 125, 126 If. • It is, of course, possible to argue that the short form found in proper names in the cuneiform inscriptions is due to, the difficulty of rendering foreign n,m1es in cuneiform, and Lhat it really represents the letragramn)alon, but thul argument is very h)'pothetical.

The mode of conveyancing property was the same as that obtaining among the Babylonians, and
fore a later form of "Yahveh," but lhe short form Jo in compounds
(= Bab. Iau, elc, ), would appear, so far as our evidence goes, to be of much earlier origin lhan "Yahveh." Is it possible that the invention of the name "Yahveh" (="He is," or" He causes to be," a term with a definite and spiritual connotation) as lhe supposed original of the philologically mcauingless(?) "Yau,"" Yo," or" Jo," a name which, like Baal, may have had the further drawback of being tinged with heathen associations, was due to the tendency of the faithful lo find :.,ome suitable derivation for sacrosanct names?
The whole question is clearly one which admits of much theorizing, bul litlie dogmatism (cf. Driver, Gmcsis, xlix.; (edd. 8 and 9) XIX., XX.; and Langdon, in Eopositor, 1910, vol. ii. 137 f.); hut as Professor Driver says, "the question of importance is, \Vhat doe~ the name come to mean lo those who use it? \Vhat are lhe character and attributes of the Being whom il actually denotes in the mouths of those who use it I Whatever may ha,·e been the ultimate historical origin of the name Yahveh (which is in any case pre-Mosaic), all that concerns the reader of the Old Testament is to know the nature and the ci1aracter and the attributes of the Being whom it denotes there, and these he must and can discover from the Old Testament itself" (Genesis iedd. 8 :;.nd 9), p. XLVII.). Assuming the conjectural present-day vocalization 1 of the telragrammaton (i.e. "Yahveh") to be correct, the name will mean either "he that is," or "he that causes to be" (the Hiphil and the Qal imperfect tenses having the same form in this verb, though it should be noted that the Hiphil only occurs rarely in late Syriac).' The intrinsic probability of this conjecture is further strengthened by Theodoret's statement that the pronunciation of the Samaritans was
JABE, while Epiphanius cites JABE as one of the names of God. The earliest known Hebrew inscription in which the tetragramma• ton is vocalized would appear to be that published by Montgomery 3 in the Museum :Jour1tal of the University of Pennsylvania.

the legal phraseology is also much the same as that used in Babylonian law. In fact, the whole legal system under which the Jewish colonists of Elephantine lived resembled closely the Babylonian law from which it was ultimately derived. Men and women had equal rights, and stood on precisely the same legal footing ; a woman could hold property equally with a man, and could dispose of it on her death in any way she pleased. Similarly in the matter of divorce, a wife could divorce her husband as easily as a husband could divorce his wife, the penally which the petitioner had to pay being virtu

The same remark, of course, applies to the forms given us by Theodore! and Epiphanius. An interesting object in regard lo the later worship and conception of "Yahveh" is the small silver coin from Gaza. 1 1t is assigned by Pilcher,' Hands,' and other scholars, to the fourth century E.C. On one side is a male head with crested helmet, and on the other side is the figure of a god, holding an eagle in his left hand, and with the three letters Y H V above his head. The letters are Phrenician, and the divine name is here spelt with three letters, as in the Aramaic papyri from Elephantine. The accompanying figure is meant to be Yahveh, here identified with Zeus. The god is seated on a winged wheel, which, as Pilcher remarks, vividly recalls the description of Yahveh in Ezekiel, but the motif itself is essentially Greek and is more aptly compared with certain Greek coins and with the wioged cars on the Greek vases of that period. Another representation of Yahveh was supposed to have been afforded by a seal published by Professor Dalman,• but Pere H ugues Vincent, after a careful examination of the intaglio, has come to the conclusion that it is a. forgery.-~

ally the same in both cases-the surrender of a portion of the marriage settlement. An interesting feature in these documents* is the mixture of names, which illustrates the internationalism so prevalent in the Persian period; not only do Jewish and Egyptian names occur, but ah;o Persian, Arabian, and Babylonian. The existence of an altar and temple of Yahveh proves that the Jewish colonists did not hold the view of their post-Exilic brethren in Palestine in regard to the Temple at Jerusalem, but considered it quite right and proper to erect temples and build altars to Yahveh wherever fate or Providence placed them, and possibly this was due to the fact that at the time of their migration, the doctrine concerning the Temple at Jerusalem and the illegality of creating temples to Yahveh elsewhere was unknown to them (cf., however, Mai. i. 11). In this connection it is interesting to compare Isaiah (xix. 10) : "In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar (llfa;;;ebalt) at the border (frontier) thereof." These papyri are further of great importance from the point of view of chronology, owing to the fact that they are dated both in Egyptian and in Syrian months. Egypt was, of course, under Persian rule during the whole of the period covered by these documents, but about twelve years later she recovered her· independence, and the reassertion of her authority probably meant a fall in the political barometer, so far as the prosperity of the Jewish colonists of Elephantine was concerned.

THE CAPTIVITIES, AND AFTER 1,1,
The most interesting of the papyri published by Sachau has been translated by Dr. Burney.* It is a letter addressed by J edoniah and the priests in Elephantine to one Bagohi (the "Bagoas" of Josephus), the Governor of J uda:a. After the usual greetings, the writer says that, in the month of Tammuz in the fourteenth year of Darius, the priests of the god Hnub conspired with the general in command of the fortress of Yeb (Elephantine) to destroy the temple of Yahveh at Elephantine. "They entered the aforesaid temple, destroyed it even to the ground, and broke the stone pillars which were there. . . . And the sacrificial bowls of gold and silver and whatever was in the aforesaid temple-the whole they took and appropriated to themselves. Now it was in the days of the kings of Egypt that our fathers built the aforesaid temple in the fortress of Yeb. And when Kambyses entered Egypt he found the aforesaid temple built; and while they demolished the temples of the gods of Egypt, no man did any harm to the aforesaid temple ... Moreover, prior to this at the time when this evil was done to us, we sent a letter concerning this. We sent to our lord as well as to Yehohanan the high priest, and his companions, the priests at Jerusalem, and to Ostanes, the brother of Anani, and the nobles of the Jews. Not a single letter have they sent to us." The writer then endeavours to enlist the co-operation of Bagohi in the work of rebuilding the destroyed temple of Yahveh, and begs that "a letter from thee be sent unto them concerning the temple of the god Yahu, that it may be rebuilt in the fortress of Yeh as it was formerly built."

The short papyrus containing Bagohi's reply 1s extant, from which we know that he responded to the appeal, and gave directions for the rebuilding of the temple.* It will be seen from the above quotation that the Jewish colony in Elephantine must have been settled long enough before the time of Cambyses' conquest of Egypt (525 B.C.) to allow for the building of an elaborate temple to Yahveh, and, in fact, the existence of this temple is traced a5 far back as the "days even of the Kings of Egypt," i.e. to the time when Egypt was ruled by native kings, and had not fallen under the sway of the Persians. \Ve apparently have evidence of the presence of Jews in Egypt before the exile in the prophetic utterances of Hosea and Isaiah. Thus, in Hosea ix. 3-6 we read that " Ephraim shall return to Egypt," and that "Egypt shall gather them up" a.nd" Memphis bury them," while reference has already been made to Isaiah xix. 19, a passage regarded, however, by the majority of recent critics as non-Isaianic.t Another of the Aramaic papyri discovered on this site gives directions for the correct observance of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and the details, so far as they go, are similar to those prescribed in Exodus and Deuteronomy. The colony was, moreover, a military colony, and these Jewish colonials,+ who arc styled '' the Jewish army in Elephantine," evidently served as a garrison on the southern frontier. The

approximate date of its foundation is a matter of speculation.• If we are to rely on the statements contained in a letter attributed to Aristeas (circ. 200 B.C.), Palestinian troops were employed in Egypt as early as the time of Psammetichus (I. or Il.),t while Asiatic troops were certainly employed by Psammetichus I. (659611 B.C.) and Phc:enician troops by Psammetichus II. (594-589 D.C.). It is also certain (see Herod II., 30) that Psammetichus I. found it necessary to fortify Elephantine against the Ethiopians, and on the occasion of Psammetichus II.'s expedition to the south, some of the mercenaries appear to have amused themselves by scratching their names on rhe monuments at Abu-Simbel, and it is thought that some of these names are Jewish. However that may be, we know that after the fall of Jerusalem, many Jews found their way even into Upper Egypt (cf. J er. xliv., passim), but Zeph. ii. 12, and iii. ro, cited strangely by Sayce, will be seen, if examined, to be no proof of the presence of Jewish captives in Egypt at the time when the passages were written. Sachau further calls attention§ to the fact that some of the individuals alluded to in these papyri may be identical with Biblical personages, as well as with persons mentioned by Josephus or in the Apocrypha.

The identification of Au§ with" Yahveh" is, however, extremely doubtful, while the Hebraic character of the proper names cited is not always clear.

T
HE excavations which have from time to time been carried on at Jerusalem are mainly of topographical interest. This is due to the eventfulness of its history as well as to the continuous occupation of its site. The first historical allusion to the city is contained in the Tell el-Amarna Letters (c. 1400 B.C.), seven of which were sent by Abdi-Khiba, the King of Jerusalem, to his overlord the King of Egypt. Even at this time Jerusalem had attained a certain preeminence among the small city-states of Southern Palestine, several of which were tributary to her, but after Abdi-Khiba, she disappears from our view till the time of the Hebrew Conquest (c. 1200 B.C.), when her king Adoni-zedek and his allies were defeated by Joshua, though the city itself appears to have remained in the hands of the Canaanites until its capture by David.

During the period which elapsed between Joshua and the destruction of the Temple by Titus (A.O. 70), the city underwent some seventeen sieges, and was twice razed to the ground, while on two other occasions its walls were levelled. After its desolation by Titus, the city disappears from the page of history for fifty years, but in A.O. r 36 Hadrian erected a new city, called Aelia Capitolina, into which Jews were prohibited, under pain of death, from entering. In A.O. 362, however, the Emperor Julian gave the Jews permission to rebuild the Temple, but they did not succeed in doing so. In A.O. 614 the city was captured by the Persian King Chosroes II., but fourteen years later it passed once more under the power of Rome. In A.O. 637 the city was taken by the Khalif Omar, and during the Moslem period Jerusalem went through many vicissitudes. About the beginning of the twelfth century the city was occupied by the Crusaders, but in A. D. I I 87 they were forced to retire at the bidding of Saladin, the ruler of the Eastern Empire. It subsequently passed under the sway of Selim I., the Sultan of Turkey, and Suleiman, his successor, built the present wall in A.D. I 542. Mohammed Ali, the Pasha of Egypt, took the city in 1834, but it was seized by the native Fella~in in 1840; after the bombardment of Acre in the same year, however, it reverted to Turkey. In these circumstances, it is hardly surprising that little has survived to tell the story of its earlier history, but that little is on that account all the more valuable. It was reasonable to infer that the city must have been occupied for a considerable period before the time of Abdi-Khiba, but until the excavations, nothing was known of its inhabitants, or their

civilization, before the latter half of the second millennium B.C. The important part which Jerusalem played in Palestinian history is due to the natural strength of its position. Situated on spurs, and defended on the east, south and south-west by fosses 500 feet deep, it was well-nigh impregnable at these points, and as a matter of history, all attacks have been made on it from the north or the north-west. But the deficiency of its natural water supply somewhat counteracted these advantages and necessitated the cutting of reservoirs and aqueducts. The most famous of these aqueducts is the rock-hewn tunnel of Siloam, by means of which the water from Gihon, or the Virgin's Fountain, was brought under the eastern hill to the upper Pool of Si loam. This tunnel was probably made by _Hezekiah in view of the approaching attack of Sennacherib (cf. p. 148 f.), but other tunnels, galleries and caverns some of which are of earlier date than the Siloam tunnel, have also been excavated.* They were found to contain Canaanite and early Israelite pottery in some cases, while in others Israelite and early "Jewish-Hellenic" pottery was discovered. Two of these channels lead from the spring of Gihon, one cut on the surface of the ground outside the city wall, which conveyed the spring water to the lower Pool of Siloam at the mouth of the Tyropceon valley, the other, a rock-hewn canal leading to a well and short tunnel, the opening of which was inside the city wall. It has been suggested that this canal was the "watercourse" (R.V.) of 2 Samuel v. 8, while in any case both of these channels are supposed to be at least as old as David.t But evidence of a far earlier culture

was afforded by the fine collection of pottery recently discovered in a funerary cavern on the top of the Ophel ; this pottery has been assigned to the early half of the third millennium B.C., and thus gives us some idea of the comparatively high degree of civilization to which the inhabitants of Jerusalem had attained at this remote date. The architectural remains of the pre-Israelite period are practically nil, while those of the Davidic era are very scanty : on the south and east sides of the south-eastern hill Dr. Bliss discovered traces of what he believed to be the wall of David (2 Sam. v. 9), and also the rock scarps which formed its foundation, while similar rock scarps, upon which the Tower of David is supposed to have rested, exist in the neighbourhood of the Tower of Phasaelus. Rock-cuttings have also been revealed south of the present city wall, and are regarded as having formed the natural foundation of the old south city wall, and in the same neighbourhood Dr. Bliss has traced two lines of fortification wall:,, one on the east slope and the other on the south slope of the western hill. Close to the Pool of Siloam the same excavator discovered a number of steps cut in the rock, which have been identified with the so-called "stairs of the city of David" (Neh. iii. 15 ). Of the building operations of Solomon still less remains; there is no doubt that the site of the Temple is to be identified with the Haram esh-Sherif, or Mosque of Omar, on the east hill of modern Jerusalem. At the south-east corner of the Haram, \Varren discovered a wall over 14 feet thick, and 7 5 feet high ; it lay buried under 4 feet of rubbish, and is apparently pre-Herodian, but most of the early



~o~ THE LATEST LIGHT ON BIBLE LANDS
remains on the f:Iaram belong to the time of Herod. From the time of Solomon down to the reign of Hezekiah, the city underwent few changes, but under the last-named king, and his successor, Manasseh, new walls were erected. Two walls, one on the north and the other on the south, have been brought to light, and the southern wall is supposed to have been erected by Hezekiah. On their return from the exile the Jews rebuilt the Temple on the same spot as that occupied by Solomon's Temple, and also set about re-erecting the city wall. The outer wall, erected by Nehemiah on the south, has been identified with the outer line of fortifications discovered by Dr. Bliss some years ago, while the remains of an ancient northern wall may also be due to Nehemiah. The remains of an ancient wall, discovered by \Varren and Guthe, and running from the south-east corner of the Temple, in a south-westerly direction, are probably to be identified with the "wall ofOphel" (Neh. iii. 27).* Of the various gates referred to in the later books of the Old Testament, the Valley Gate, the Fountain Gate, and the Dung Gate, may probably be identified with existing remains. The Valley Gate (Neh. iii. 13) has been identified with an opening on the south-west slope of the western hill. A similar opening has been identified with the Fountain Gate (Neh. ii. 13 f.), and
• For the meaning of the name "Ophel," cf. Burney, Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration F1111d, 1911, pp. 51-56. Burney maintains that "Ophel II does not mean "hill', but II fortress,~' and that the "Ophel " at Jerusalem was• originally the fortress of the city uf David.



EXCAVATIONS IN SOUTH PALESTINE 20;
the Dung Gate has been identified with an opening discovered by Dr. Bliss at the south-east end of the western hill.• Apart, however, from these architectural remains, it must be confessed that Jerusalem has not yielded much material for the reconstruction of early Palestinian history, and other sites of lesser historical importance have proved more fruitful quarries for the archa!ologist and the antiquarian.
LACHISH.t
The excavations at Tell el-J:iesy, the site of ancient Lachish, have a twofold interest, primarily of course on account of the actual discoveries made on this site, and secondarily by reason of the fact that it was here that the foundations of scientific excavation in Palestine were first laid by Professor Flinders Petrie in I 890. This mound was found to contain the ruined debris of some eleven cities, which, according to the evidence of the pottery, must have ranged from about 1700 B.C. to 400 B.C. It has thus been very aptly described by Dr. Bliss as a "Mound of Many Cities." These "mounds" or "Tells" in the east in nearly all cases contain the remains of a bygone civilization, and owe their existence to the architectural customs which prevailed among the peoples of \Vestern A.sia from the earliest times. A city consisted in a number of houses generally

made of crude or sun-dried bricks. Such buildings were bound to succumb ultimately to the combined attack of time and climate, even if they escaped the devastating hand of war. In either case the buildings were demolished in the end, but the ruined debris was not cleared away, part of the old material being sometimes used again in the construction of the new building, while the remainder, when levelled, served as a kind of platform foundation. It will thus be seen that this process carried out a sufficient number of times would result in a mound, such as is seen in the figure (Fig. 81). Tell el-Hesy is not, however, entirely the product of artificial formation. The first city was built on a low natural mound 50 or 60 feet high, while the artificial debris above, measure another 60 feet. The earliest fortification on this site of which remains have been discovered, has been assigned to the early part of the second millennium B.C. The ruler of the first city owed allegiance to Egypt, and an Egyptian temple of the goddess Hathor found a place within its walls. This city fell a victim to fire as did also the third city, leaving an enormous amount of ashes and debris, which were found to contain a quantity of native pottery, and also remains resembling both early Cyprian and Mycemean ware. It is said that some of the painted pottery found in these lower strata bears a close resemblance to pottery found at Boghaz Keui, and is therefore probably Hittite in origin, while Prof. Sayce is disposed to attribute the ongm of the Minoan "Kamares" ware of Crete to this painted pottery of Asia Minor.•

One of the most interesting relics recovered from the earlier strata at Tell el-l:lesy is a small Assyrian cuneiform tablet. It has reference to a certain Zimrida, Governor of Lachish, who is otherwise known from the letter he sent to his overlord the King of Egypt ; the latter was discovered along with a number of other cuneiform tablets at Tell el-Amarna in Upper Egypt (cf. p, 96 f.). The discovery of this tablet thus synchronizes the date of the stratum in which it was found with the XVIIIth dynasty, and fixes the date of the city, the ruins of which are represented by this stratum, at about 1400 B.C., a date the correctness of which was further substantiated by the discovery of a number of scarabs belonging to the same period. The upper part of the stratum containing the ruins of the fourth city, ic. the city immediately above that just referred to, has yielded scarabs of the XIXth dynasty, and it was probably this city, therefore, that was taken by Joshua about
1200 B.C. Iron objects were found here, the weapons and implements recovered from the lower strata being
always bronze.

GEZER*
The site of Gezer, represented by the modern mound of Tell ej-Jezer (cf. Fig. 82), was discovered by M. Clermont-Ganneau in l 87 L It lies about nineteen miles west-north-west of Jerusalem, and occupies a strategic position between that city, Egypt, and the sea. The earliest mention of Gezer in the Old Testament is contained in the book of Joshua (x. 33), where we read that " Horam, King of Gezer, came up to help Lachish," but that Joshua succeeded in utterly routing their combined forces. Elsewhere we read that the Israelites failed to drive out the "Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer" (Joshua xvi. IO, and cf. Judges i. 29), while subsequently the town and its Canaanite population were destroyed by the Egyptians (1 Kings ix., 16), and given by the Pharaoh as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife, and Solomon undertook its restoration (1 Kings ix. l 5, 17).
The earliest historical mention t of Gezer is that contained in the annals of Thothmes (c. 1475 B.C.) where he includes it among the cities which he had taken. Some years later the Governor of Gezer, one Yapakhi, is in correspondence with his overlord the king of Egypt, while Abdi-Khiba, king of Jerusalem,

fi\'e miles or Gezer,"" he is not prepared to assign the drawings in the Gezer cave to so remote a date. In the neolithic period, Gezer was occupied by a nonSemitic people of comparatively short stature, who dwelt in caves or primitive huts of wood and stone. They cremated their dead, apparently in a special cave prepared for the purpose, and they deposited vessels containing food and drink for the consumption of the deceased, a sure and certain evidence of their belief in the future life. The burial cave in question measures about 30 feet by 24 feet, and contained a number of enclosures composed of flat stonespossibly the graves of grandees. This prehistoric cemetery was surrounded by an earth rampart about 6 feet high and 6 feet thick. The inside of this rampart was revetted by a stone wall some 2 feet in thickness, while the outside was similarly strengthened with masonry. In the same stratum a rock platform was discovered in which were a large number of cup-shaped hollows of different sizes (cf. Fig. 84), while beneath were three large caves and an orifice. It has been supposed that the latter was used as a shaft for the purpose of despatching meat-offerings and drink-offerings to the subterranean deities, while the cup-marks have been generally regarded as natural basins for the reception of sacrificial blood (see further p. 224). The caves of these Troglodytes contained rough hand-made pottery, some of which was decorated with red or white lines. The only weapons or large implements discovered were made of flint, which was in certain cases wrought very skilfully, while the bones of various animals and birds, including the cow, the pig, the sheep, the goat, and the stork, were • Cf.

A number of grindstones were further found, proving that agriculture was not unknown to this primitive people.* In r907 another large rock-hewn cave of great interest was discovered.

lumps of iron, which Macalister * says must have fallen in with other refuse after the abandoment of the cave. However that may be, this is the "oldest evidence of the use of iron "in Palestine. The strata immediately above those characterized by the Troglodyte caves yielded numerous Egyptian scarabs belonging to the period from the Xllth to the XIXth dynasty, which made it possible to relatively fix the dates of the other deposits in the same strata. Some of the scarabs recovered belong to the Hyksos period, and prove that even then Egyptian influence held its own against that of Babylonia. The lower stratum, which must be assigned to the time of the XIIth dynastyi.e. to a date probably not later than about 2000 B.C. to 1788 B.C.-was found to contain the _burials of a Semitic people, a people therefore racially distinct from the Neolithic Troglodytes. The mode of burial adopted by this Semitic people was, however, entirely Egyptian in character, though the bodies had not been embalmed, and according to
Griffith, t the practice of embalming the dead was not in vogue in Egypt itself at that period, but it would appear that the evidence regarding the disposition of the dead in Egyi:,t at this time is too scant to admit of any positive statement regarding this question. One of the graves belonging to the early part of this period (XIIth dynasty) was found to contain the skeletons of two men, in extended position and surrounded by a number of vessels of varying shape. Above these vessels was half of the skeleton of a boy which had been cut in two, like the girl whose mutilated body had been previously found in the cistern on

the same site, These remains of the boy were buried about the foundations of a building, and there is no doubt that we have here an instance of a human foundation-sacrifice.* The practice of dismembering the dead admits of many explanations, it has for example • been explained by some on the theory of cannibalism, by others it has been associated with the idea that underlies the Osiris legend, while some would connect
it with the use of bones as amulets. t The real significance of the dismemberment of the dead in early Egypt is also uncertain ; no doubt the practice was originally connected with the Osiris legend, and its object was apparently either to do away with all the impurities inherent in or attaching to the flesh, or else to burst the prison gates and set the non-physical part of man for ever free. In Palestine, on the other hand, the data are so slight that we can but conjecture as to the meaning. The performance of a remarkable rite in the Philippine Islands, which may
be parallel to it is cited :t: by Macalister in the Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund (1909, p. 112). A child was tied to a tree, transfixed with a spear, and then chopped into pieces, each of the natives present at the ceremony carrying off a piece as an amulet for protection against evil spirits. The mutilated skeleton of the boy at Gezer is probably an example of a foundation-sacrifice § offered to ensure the security and prosperity of the building. Why the infant was dismembered we

cannot say ; presumably it is to be explained on the analogy of animal victims (Lev. i. ; Homer, etc.). Amoni::- the more interesting relics recovered from the early part of the stratum with which we are concerned (i.e. c. 2000 B.c.) a clay model of a shrine is deserving of special note. Unfortunately it was found in a very fragmentary condition, but in spite of this fact, it is of considerable importance, inasmuch as it gives us some idea as to the general appearance of an old Canaanite covered-in sanctuary. The sanctuary was apparently separated from an open fore-court by a doorway, in immediate proximity to which were two stoups, used either as receptacles for drink-offerings or as lavers for ceremonial ablutions, while an image of a grotesquely conceived human being with a tall cap would appear to have been stationed on either side of the court, and was presumably intended to represent the god.'" Of the smaller objects belonging to the latter half of this period a clay tablet, bearing (apparently) a cylinder-seal impression of various astrological emblems, deserves a mention. The emblems closely resemble those occurring on Babylonian boundarystones, which this tablet, however, probably antedates. Whether we are to see in this tablet-generally known as the" Zodiac-Tablet "-evidence of the existence of common emblems in Babylonia and Palestine, or whether, on the other hand, the tablet itself emanated from Babylonia and is to be regarded as evidc:nce of the early influence exerted by Babylonia on Palestinian civilization, is a matter of speculation.t The

discovery of a seal in an earlier stratum (2500-2000 B.C.) conforming to the same general type as the impression on the "Zodiac Tablet," corroborates Macalister's theory that the impression was made from a seal belonging to an earlier date than the stratum in which the tablet was found. The remains of the Solomonic period are not as numerous as one could wish. One of the more noteworthy of the smaller objects is a clay model of a boat,* 7 inches long and 2 inches broad. It is pointed at both ends and has a prominent keel, which turns upwards and ends in a short post at both ends, thereby resembling the Phc:enician crafts depicted on later Assyrian bas-reliefs.t In this connection it is interesting to recall the fact that Hiram, King of Tyre, sent to Solomon "in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea" (r Kings ix. 27). An interesting relic belonging to the early Israelite
period is portion of a mould t designed for casting jewellery; it is made of a hard basaltic stone and was discovered amid debris belonging to about rooo B.C., while to the same period or a little later must be assigned the Egyptian lotus-shaped incense-burner, recovered on the same site. § The period represented by the fourth stratum is characterized by the prevalence of 'Ashtart-worship

clay representations bear traces of Egyptian and Phrenician influence, and similar figures have been brought to light at Tell el-Hesy, Taanach, and other Palestinian sites as well as at Cyprus and Zinjirli. Evidence of the relationship subsisting between the later inhabitants of Gezer and the Assyrian empire was afforded by Prof. Macalister's discovery of two cuneiform tablets, belonging to the middle of the seventh century u.c. (i.e. Ashur-banipal's reign) and containing Hebrew names. On one of these tablets we have the terms of a contract in respect of the sale of a field, while the other is a contract for the sale of a landed e5tate ; the name of one of the owners (Nethaniah) is Hebrew, but nearly all the other names are Assyrian. Unfortunately, very few early Hebrew inscriptions have as yet been brought to light by Palestinian excavators ; one of the most remarkable c.f these is the limestone tablet discovered at Gezer, while the inscribed jar-handles from the same site are of considerable importance for the study of Semitic Epigraphy (cf. further p. 2 56 f.). But we are fortunately not without some information concerning the history of the city itself. The discovery of a wall, some ro feet thick, composed of stone blocks measuring from 11⁄2 to 2 feet square, shows that Gezer was a fortified town at an early date, this wall being assigned by the excavators to the middle of the third millenium B.C. The interstices between the irregular stones of which this wall consisted were filled in with smaller stones, while the wall itself would appear to have been provided with high but narrow towers which projected beyond the face of the wall and occurred at intervals of 90

feet. On the southern side the wall was pierced by a gate-way, 42 feet deep and 9 feet wide : the gate was flanked by two towers constructed of rude masonry, and faced with sun-dried bricks, while the passage itself was paved with stone flags. Above the ruins of the towers referred to were a number of small crudely-built houses, containing scarabs, beads, pottery and other relics belonging to the time of the XVIIIth dynasty. At a somewhat later date, i.e. about 1400 B.C., a city-wall of somewhat greater circumference was erected. Like the earlier wall, it was made of stone, and was fortified with brick-faced towers, while it measured about 14 feet in thickness. This wall is supposed to have served as the defence of three successive cities, ranging from 1400100 B.C., and Professor Macalister is inclined to see in some of the towers, the work of repair executed by Pharaoh after his cupture of the city, preliminary to his bestowing the same upon his daughter as a dowry. The remains of one other important and extensive structure must be briefly mentioned: it is built round one of the towers of the inner wall, but was not constructed till after the later outer city-wall had been erected. The walls of this building (apparently a Canaanite castle) vary from 3 to 9 feet in thickness, and from the archa:ological evidence of the objects therein discovered, it has been assigned to the thirteenth century B.C. Among the many interesting architectural relics belonging to this period may be mentioned a large building stone inscribed with the Egyptian hieroglyph for "gold." This stone probably formed part of an Egyptian temple partially or wholly covered with

hieroglyphs, and is one of the many indications of Egyptian influence at this time. Perbaps the most striking of all the discoveries

all. It is believed that the Canaanites regarded these unrlrc5sed monoliths as the abode of their gods. A Phrenician stelc from Sicily (cf. Corpus, lnscr. Semit. I., 135), where we see three such stones and a worshipper in front, supports the theory. In Genesis xxviii. I 8, we read of Jacob erecting the stone that he had put under his head, as a ma:,:,i'biih. • This he anointed and named it "Beth-elohim" (v. 22), and the place II Beth-el" (both = "the house (i.e. abode) of God "), while in Isaiah xix. 19, we read : 11 there shall be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt and a ma:,:,ebiih at the border thereof to the Lord," which conclusively proves that the 111a;;?ebiilt was regarded as a legitimate religious symbol at all events in the time of Isaiah. And it is a noteworthy fact that some of the ma:;.?ebiihs discovered at Taanach have been assigned to the Israelite period, and were therefore possibly erected by Israelites. By the time of the Deuteronomist the use of asherahs and ma??lbiihs in the service of Yahveh is strictly forbidden (cf. Deut. xvi. 21, 22), their prohibition, of course, being due to the heathen rites and ceremonies with which they became specifically associated on the one hand, and to the growth of spiritual conceptions among the Israelites on the other. The largest of the standing-stones at Gezer is 101⁄2 feet high, over 41⁄2 feet broad, and 2t feet thick, and they stand upon a pavement under which a brick of pure gold was discovered. The remains of another Canaanite sanctuary were brought to light in 1905, consisting of a row of four ma;;;;eb!liis and the stump of a fifth, while similar • Cf.: Basting's Diel. iii. 879, 880.

stones have been discovered at Taanach, Megiddo, and other Palestinian sites. The rough date assigned to the majority of these ma'¥'¥ebiihs is 1400 B.c., and it is interesting to note that m,my primitive peoples of our own day still associate their deities with monoliths, wherein they are supposed to dwell." In some of these 111a?;:?biihs there are cup-shaped hollows apparently similar to those found in the flat rock surface to which allusion has already been made (cf. Fig. 83), and also to those on rock-altars at Gezer, Taanach, and Megiddo. If the generally accepted theory that these stones were regarded as the abodes of deities be correct, then the cup-shaped hollows would appear to have served as receptacles for drink-offerings or sacrificial blood ; and in connection with the sacrificial purpose which the cavities alluded to are supposed to have served, Professor Driver aptly recalls the passage in Isaiah (]vii. 6), where idolatrous Israelites are upbraided for pouring out libations to "the smooth stones of the valley." As these cavities occur in the sides as well as on the top of the ma'¥~ebahs, possibly the cup-shaped hollows on the tops of the ma:;;;ebiihs were destmed to receive libations or drink-offerings, while those on the sides mark the places where sacred stones were anointed or smeared
with sacrificial blood. Spoer t is of opinion that the hollows found in the neighbourhood of wells or cisterns were used for watering animals, while those found either in front of or on the top of dolmens and menhirs may have served a sacrificial

purpose. Those, however, which are hollowed out on the sides of these stones, he regards as emblems of the Semitic mother-goddess Astarte, or Ashtoreth. Gressmann,• on the other hand, maintains that the standing stones in Palestine are in all cases either memorial stones or boundary stones, the memorials being erected sometimes in honour of the dead, sometimes to commemorate a notable event in the life of the nation or of some distinguished persons. The same scholar is of opinion that the cup-marks were invariably used as receptacles for water offered to the dead, in which case all ma??ebiiks with cavities would, according to this theory, be memorial-stones of the dead. Were that the case, upon what hypothesis are we to explain the existence of ma;Jebiihs without cup-marks immediately by the side of or in obvious relationship to other ma;?ebiihs with cup-marks ? Are we to suppo3e that in some cases the bereaved thought fit to provide the dead with water, while in other cases they neglected to do so ? Of course, it is possible that memorial stones of the dead, and monu• ments commemorative of current events may have been erected side by side, but it does not seem at all probable ; and in view of the well attested practice of erecting ma;;ebiihs for religious pur• poses among primitive peoples, it would appear more reasonable to associate these monoliths with that practice. There is the same difference of opinion among scholars regarding the meaning and significance of the infant jar-burials discovered at Gezer and elsewhere. The usually accepted theory is that the

human bones contained in the jars are the remains of child-sacrifices.• At Gezer a whole cemetery of jar-buried infants was revealed ; and as the burials in question were found in the stratum underneath the
"high place " of Gezer, the sacrificial theory a priori seems probable, while the discovery of some twenty jar-buried infants at Taanach in close proximity to a rock-altar affords additional support to this contention ; it must be noted, however, that the child-burials at Taanach were not near to any monoliths as was the case both at Gezer and at Megiddo. At the last-named place four jar-burials were discovered, beneath the corner of a "temple" ; inside or about each of these primitive sarcophagi were two or three vessels, which doubtless at one time contained food and drink for the infants' consumption in the nether world. If that be the case, and if these infant jar-burials are in reality instances of early human sacrifices, it would appear that some effort was made to compensate the victims for the untimely curtailment of life in this world, by providing them so far as possible with the necessary means of living in the next world, though even this work of piety was probably dictated by personal considerations, for not improbably the Babylonian belief that the neglected dead wreaked their vengeance on the living prevailed also in Palestine. But in the case of the Taanach jar-burials, the explanation offered by Pere Vincent and Professor Sellin is that the remains are those of children who had died too young to be interred in the family

EXCAVATIONS IN SOUTH PALESTINF, 227
tombs,* while W. H. Wood t extends this theory and gives it a universal application to all the infant-burials in Palestine, including of course those found in the vicinity of the "high places." He regards all these jar-burials merely as instances of the widespread custom of depositing the dead in jars, a custom which prevailed in early Egypt, Babylonia, and Assyria.t On the other hand, the practice of offering the firstborn in sacrifice; was an old and well-attested Semitic custom. Among the Hebrews, the first-born of men and the firstlings of animals were sacred to Jehovah ; but Jehovah did not require the offering of human blood, and redemption took the place of actual sacrifice. The principle was, however, recognized from the earliest times, as Abraham's literal acceptation oC the Divine command to offer up his son Isaac proves ; § but the actual sacrifice was not exacted, and the patriarch thus learnt the truth to which Micah gave utterance so many centuries after:-" Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?" The surrounding nations had not, however, attained to the same degree of spirituality. Thus we read that Mesha, King of Moab, when sore pressed by the Israelites, " took his eldest son . . . and offered him for a burnt offering

upon the wall," while it seems improbable that Jephthah some centuries earlier would have vowed to offer" whosoever" (Judges xi. 3I, R.V.m.) met him from the house, or would have actually offered his daughter, had human sacrifice been unknown around him. It should be observed, however, that he did not vow his d,wgltter, in the first instance, and she was neither his first-born nor an infant, so it is not a complete parallel to the Gezer infants. But many of these jar-burials were deposited in the foundations or structure of buildings. Thus in some of the later buildings at Gezer, skeletons of infants in jars were brought to light ; elsewhere skeletons of adults were also discovered, while under the foundations of a building belonging to the time of the Xllth dynasty, two extended skeletons of men were unearthed. Megiddo and Taanach have yielded similar evidence of this custom. Professor Driver* says: "It can hardly be doubted that these are examples of foundation-sacrifices, i.e. of sacrifices offered at the foundation of a building for the purpose of ensuring the stability of the structure and the welfare of those about to occupy or use it." (For similar practices in many different parts of the world, cf. Tylor, Primiti7.1e Culture, i., 94 f.; Trumbull, Titres/told Covenant (1890), 45 f., as cited by Driver, 1bid. p. 7 r.) It has been supposed that we have an allusion to some such practice in Joshua vi. 26, where a curse is pronounced upon the man who should attempt to rebuild Jericho-" he shall lay the foundation thereof in his first-born, and in his youngest son shall he set :.ip the gates of it." But as Driver remarks (Scltweiclt

Lectures, 72): "The curse implies not an ordinary practice, but that something unusual and unexpected would happen to Hiel." The common supposition that Hie! lost his sons through some accident happening to them while the work of rebuilding was in progress is more probably correct. It is interestingto note that a foundation or inauguration sacrifice of a sheep was offered as recently as I 898, at the building of a jetty for the landing of the German Emperor at Haifa.* From the evidence at present available, it would thus appear that at least three classes of jar-burials have been found in Palestine, i.e. those which are burials pure and simple, those which are ordinary human sacrifices, and, lastly, those which are human foundation-sacrifices. In conclusion the history of Gezer as revealed by the excavations may be divided into five main
periods t: I. The Pre-Semitic period (3000-2000 B.c.), during which Gezer was occupied by neolithic cavedwellers who cremated their dead. II. The so-called Amorite period (2000-1500 B.C.), first of the three Semitic periods when the city was in the hands of a taller people, who buried and did not cremate their dead, and who appear to have been in the habit of offering human beings in sacrifice to their gods. There is evidence of Egyptian inAuence (XIIth dynasty) at this time. III. The Canaanite period (1500--1000 n.c.). during which Egyptian inAuence became more dominant, while from 1200IOOO n.c. Philistine and Cretan inAuence begins to make its appearance. IV. The Israelite period

The site of Jericho is represented by the modern mound of Tell es-Sultan, while the name of the ancient city is perpetuated in the neighbouring village of Eri~a.t (Cf. Fig. 88.) Excavations were inaugurated here early in 1908 by Prof. Sellin, who had already done such good work at Tell Ta'annek. The ruins consist in a long oval mound, measuring about I IOO feet in length and 500 feet in breadth, from which arise seven hills varying in height from I 6 feet to 40 feet. In ancient days these hills were surrounded by a wall, oval like the mound and about half a mile long. The city found a copious water supply at the spring which now bears the name of 'Aines-Sultan, while it also received all the benefits to be derived from the rains of the hill country, and was in consequence extremely fertile.

Jerusalem and thirty-three miles from Samaria, it formed an important trading centre and emporium, and it doubtless owes the early occupation of its site to the commercial possibilitie~ of its position. The city wall, which is very well preserved, rested on a bed some 3 or 4 feet thick, composed of a mixture of loam and gravel. Upon this was superimposed the wall, of which the lower part was formed of stones and rubble, and the upper part of brick. The brickwork still stands to the height of about S feet, and is approximately 6} feet thick, while the rubble wall beneath is 16 feet high, and varying from 6! to S feet in thickness. At the·northern end of this oval-shaped city-wall were found the remains of a citadel with a double protecting wall in front. Both the walls of the city and of the citadel itself are very substantial and massive in character, and are a striking testimony to the architectural skill of the pre-Israelite inhabitants of Canaan. Within the citadel were found the walls and rooms of Canaanite houses along with Canaanite pottery and a number of infant jar-burials. With the latter were found a number of amphorae of what is called the ff SyroIsraelite II form, together with some egg-shaped vessels of the Cypriot and late Mycena!an type.'" Skeletons were found under the foundations of some of the buildings, which afforded further evidence of the practice of offering human foundation-sacrifices.

excavations on the south•east of the Tell near the spring were productive of more satisfactory results in regard to the Israelite occupation. A number of Jsraelite houses were found here belonging to the time of Ahab; the date of these houses was fixed by the discovery of two Cypriot jugs of red clay with hlack colouring, a style of ware found in Greece down to the seventh century, while the inscriptions on jar-handles discovered on this site afforded similar evidence of the occupation of Jericho by the Israelites (cf. further p. 259). Among the various relics discovered in the lsradite strata were lamps, loom-weights in stone and terra-cotta, corn-mills of red sandstone, a collection of iron implements, together with a vast amount of pottery. The dramatic episode recorded in Joshua of the immediate and semi-miraculous collapse of the walls of Jericho before the invading Israelites has not unnaturally excited a desire in some people to discover the remains of the fallen city-walls. The walls, however, like the citadel are Canaanite work, and show no sign of having been destroyed to the extent that a reader of Joshua vi. would suppose to have been the case. They are of substantial workmanship, and still, for the greater part of their circumference, standing to a considerable height. It is not to be inferred from Joshua vi. 26, and 1 Kings xvi. 34, that Jericho was without inhabitants from the time of Joshua to that of Ahab. 2 Sam. x. 5 implies that it was inhabited in David's time, and all the arch~ological evidence available tends to show that it was occupied continuously. The actual remains show tl:at whatever destruction of the walls

had taken place, it was very partial, and Joshua vi. 26, 1 Kings xvi. 34, refer, not to its occupation, but to the rebuilding of such parts of the walls as were destroyed, so that it might again become a properly fortified town. According to the Hebrew account, iron was known and used by the pre-Israelite occupants of the city, but at present no archa!ological evidence of the use of iron among the Canaanites has been forthcoming (cf. however, p. 216), and no iron was found in the Canaanite strata at Jericho. On the other hand, it is interesting to remark that a distinct break was noticeable in the pottery, the old Canaanite ware giving place to the later pottery with an abruptness not to be seen elsewhere. Normally, the development of the earlier pottery into the later Israelite ware can be readily traced, but here the line of demarcation seems to be more or less cut and dried. This is an indication of a sudden break in the cultural history of the inhabitants of Jericho, and may throw some light on the Biblical account of Joshua's conquest.

The site which specifically occupied the attention of the Palestine Exploration Fund last year (1911) is that of Beth-Shemesh, close to the modern' A in Slums (cf. Fig. 91). Beth-Shemesh lies about 16 miles west

under the directorship of Dr. Mackenzie. Ain Shems has only ceased to be a place of local habitation within the last fifty years,* and a large proportion of the remains discovered belonged to the Christian era, and therefore throw no new light on the pages of the Hebrew Scriptures. The earlier strata have, however, yielded a considerable amount of material for the reconstruction of the history of the city and of its successive occupants. In the lower strata imported pottery belonging to the Bronze Age, and similar to that found in Cyprus, was discovered. This pottery would appear to be "pre-Semitic" in date, and was found alongside of native pottery. Of the architectural remains, a stone wall and a
fortified gate belonging probably to the Canaanite t period, are of special interest. The gate is in very good preservation, and has a narrow entrance and a long passage " between side-chambers for the guard and defence of the fort." :j: The wall resembles the Israelite wall at Gezer, and the gate is similar to those found by Place at Khorsabad in Assyria. The early city to which the gateway belonged would appear to have undergone a siege, and it is conjectured that the besiegers may have been Israelites.§ Above the ruins of this fortified city were found the remains of a later city, which was not fortified. This later city would appear to have been Canaanite like its forerunner, and if the Israelites were responsible for the wreckage of the early fortified city it is suggested that they may have allowed the Canaanite popnlation to rebuild the city, on condition that they did not fortify it. § But, as is so constantly

the case, it is to the abodes of the dead, rather than to the dwelling-places of the living, that we are indebted for most of the interesting discoveries on this site. The burial caves may be divided into two main classes. The earlier of the two comprises cave-tombs of natural formation. The best example of a Troglodyte cave-tomb of this character* is a large circular cave with two deep recesses. In this grave many calcined bones were discovered, which Dr. Mackenzie associates with ceremonial meals rather than with the practice of cremation ; the presence of mutton bones certainly seems to support this theory, but possibly a careful examination of the rest of these calcined bones will lead to some conclusion as to their original owner. If none of the calcined bones are those of a human being, then Dr. Mackenzie's theory will no doubt hold good, and as he very truly remarks: "the idea of providing the dead with a veritable chamber implies conceptions quite distinct from those where cremation is' practised " ; but he goes on to say "that the occurrence of cremation in chamber tombs is evidently due to the fusion of different rites," and the question therefore arises as to whether the burials at Beth-Shemesh are illustrative of this "fusion of different rites." In "Tomb II.," the tomb which Dr. Mackenzie describes as being a good example of the later cave-burials at Beth-Shemesh, actual "skeletons" were found. There can, therefore, be no question of cremation here, while in" Tomb I." (the grave selected as beingitypical of the earlier burials) and in" Tomb II." mutton bones were discovered. These bones must obviously be associated with a ceremonial meal, or sacrifice to the

dead. But if all the calcined bones in" Tomb I." belong to animals. and no skeletons or human remains of any kind were discovered, are we to assume that the skeletons were stolen or removed, for there is presumably no doubt that the cave-chamber designated as "Tomb I." is an abode of the dead and not a human dwelling-place-or are they buried beneath the accumulation of debris? Theoriginal entrance• to "Tomb I." was at the side, but this gave place subsequently to a cylindrical and vertical shaft which penetrated the roof of the chamber. Access to "Tomb II." was gained by a similar shaft, from which, however, a '' narrow inclined tunnel" descended into the grave-room. Thi5 burial-chamber differs from "Tomb I." in being rectangular instead of circular, and has a divan arrangement similar to that found at Petra, Jerusalem, and elsewhere. There was further a recess in which potter)'" and other objects belonging to earlier burials were found. c\pparently some of the pottery may be provisionally assigned to the period of the Jewish monarchy.t It is interesting to note that lamps were discovered in the grave-room; these lamps were doubtless used in connection with some ceremony, and recall the terracotta lamps found in the burial-vaults at Ashur, where there was also a nich or recess. :j: In addition to the entrance-shaft this tomb was further provided with a " separate fac;ade entrance," consisting in a small portal closed by a stone slab held in position by means of a stone cylinder.

its fa~ade entrance and its divan, conforms to a type found constantly all over the Mediterranean area,* and probably owes its origin to an attempt to imitate the dwelling-places of the living. The fa<;ade entrance recalls the false doors of Egyptian tombs. In Egypt the practice of making false doors was in vogue at all events as early as the IIlrd dynasty, for they are represented on some of the wall-reliefs of the period, a good example of which is that taken from the wall of the tomb of Suten-abu at Denderah, and now preserved in the British Museum (No. 1266). Graves of this description in Palestine have hitherto been assigned to the Roman period, but the discovery of Semitic pottery in this tomb shows that this type was in use long before the period of the Roman Empire. Some of these burial-caves had clearly been rifled, but in spite of the predatory raids of booty-hunters, many interesting relics have survived their greed, among which may be mentioned an early type of Semitic lamp, an Egyptian alabaster vessel of the XVII Ith dynasty or thereabouts, figures of Bes, Isis, and Astarte, scarabs, and a bronze spear-head and arrow-head, the position of which against the face of the outer wall of the city would suggest that they did not belong to the men of Beth-Shemesh, but to an attacking army, while the burnt condition of many of the relics seems to justify the assumption that the city was once burnt down. Vincent indeed suggests that the thick layer of burnt debris which is found at a more or less uniform level over part of the town may represent the handiwork of the conquering Israelites.

discovered in "Tomb I."-a good example of the earliest type of rock tomb-afford abundant evidence of Egyptian influence, and none of Babylonian or ..£gean. The absence of JEgean pottery is particularly noticeable, as it is found elsewhere on this site in no small quantities. Cypriot pottery of the bronze age was indeed found in the deposits "next the rock,• but presumably the deposits in question, though early, are to be assigned to a later date than "Tomb I." In one of the graves at Beth-Shemesh, characterized by the divan arrangement and the fa-.ade door, were found two terra-cotta figurines,t one female, the other apparently male, which in contrast with those found in "Tomb I.," 2pparently betray no Egyptian influence whatever. The male figure is said to be remarkable for its beak-like face. The
only inscribed objects t recovered were a number of jar-handles (similar to those found at Tel e~-Safi and elsewhere; cf. further, p. 258 f., and Driver, Schweiclz Lectures, p. 74 f. (with illustrations)) of the Israelite period, on one of which Vincent§ read the inscription "To the King. Hebron," while the discovery of flint implements among the earliest types of Semitic pottery, proved that the place was occupied at an earlier date than could be inferred from Biblical history or Assyrian tablets.JI The most interesting result of this year's (1912) expedition was the discovery of the High Place of Bethshemesh. Five pillars were found, "lying on their sides as if they had been knocked down." 1 They had rounded tops but flat bases, "for better

standing." Owing to their resemblance to pillars discovered in association with family tombs on the same site, Dr. Mackenzie suggests that these pillars may have been originally connected with sepulchral rites and beliefs.• At a very great depth below the surface, and beneath the High Place, a burial-cave, "with all the paraphernalia of the cult of the dead there in posi
tion as they had been left thousands of years ago," t was revealed. On the west side of the High Place, was a circle of stones which were found to encircle the entrance to a shaft which led down to another subterranean chamber. Near to this chamber, the well of 'Ain
Slzems was discovered. t Whether the chamber was connected with the well, as was the case at Gezer, subsequent excavations will no doubt demonstrate. The general results § arrived at in regard to the cultural history of the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh are that in the earliest periods, the influence of Egypt and C_rete was paramount. This subsequently gave place to that of the Philistines, while last of all the Israelites became dominant. Various other sites in Southern Palestine have received the attention of the Palestine Exploration Fund, two of the most fruitful of which are Tell es
!;,afi, probably Gath, and Tell Zakariya, possibly the ancient Azeka. Both of these sites are situated in the borderland between Philistia and Jud.:ea, but neither of them can be traced back to so early a period as Gezer or Lachish. They go back, however, as far as the

second millennium B.C., and were occupied by the Canaanites. The Philistine remains, especially those from Tell e~-Safi, support the theory that the Philistines were Minoan or Mycemean in origin, and it has indeed been suggested that Zakariya derived its name from the same source as Zakro in Crete, but it would appear rather to be so called from a chapel of Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist.* At Tell es-Safi, rocks with cup-marks were found, as also at Marmi'ta, Zarca., Tell SandaJ:iannah and elsewhere, while both at Tell Zakariya, Tell e~-~afi, Tell SandaJ:tannah, and Tell ej-J udeideh, jug-handles inscribed in Hebrew characters were brought to light. It is not within the scope of this volume to discuss even cursorily the results of the excavations carried on by Robinson, Hoskins, Libbey, Forder, Dalman, Porter and others on the east side of the Jordan, and in Arabia, suffice it to say that the remains of some twenty-five "high-places" have been discovered in the neighbourhood of Petra.t These" high-places" were generally situated on a hill, access to them being gained by means of stairways hewn in the rock. They consisted of a court or courts cut in the rock, with seats for worshippers, and an altar with steps leading up to it.

SAMARIA.*
J
ERUSA LEM, the capital of the kingdom of Judah, has for many years attracted the attention of the excavator and the archaeologist, chiefly, no doubt, owing to the importance attaching to that site, as the scene of so many incidents in the early life of Christianity, as the seat of its origin, and the death-place of its Founder; but Samaria, the capital of the larger and more important kingdom of Israel, to whose monarch many a petty king of Judah owed allegiance, has until two or three years ago received little or no attention. This was due not so much to the non-recognition of its importance as to the extensiveness of its ruins, and the costliness
of a scientific exploration of its site. In 1908,f however, an expedition was conducted thither by Dr. Gottlieb Schumacher, the well-known German excavator, whose work at Tell el-Mutesellim (Megiddo) had already won for him a world-wide reputation, and Professor G. A. Reisner, under the

directorship of Professor D. G. Lyon, of Harvard University. The ruins of Israel's ancient capital are to be found on a large isolated hill, some 350 feet high, situated about six miles north-west of Nablus (Shechem) and twenty miles from the Mediterranean ; the hill is covered with olive-orchards, fig. trees, and pomegranates. This hill is said to have been purchased by Omri, who built a town called Shomerun (Samaria) thereon, about 900 n.c. (1 Kings xvi. 24), while Ahab, the son of Omri, built a temple to Baal there, and also an "ivory palace." The site was occupied as the capital of the northern kingdom down to 722 B.C. (r Kings xxii.; 2 Kings xviii.), but in that year the city was captured by Sargon, who carried off 27,000 people into captivity, the remainder of those left in the city being ruled by an Assyrian Governor (2 Kings xvi i. 6; xvi ii. 9). Sargon and Esarhaddon further installed Babylonian colonists in place of the exiled Israelites ; the city was subsequently taken by Alexander the Great, but continued to be occupied right down to the time of Herod, who rebuilt it and named it Sebaste (30-1 B.C.). The mound thus contains the remains of four distinct cities, Herod's city, the Seleucid city, the Babylonian city, the history of which lay between the date of Israel's captivity and Alexander's ascendency, and, lastly, the Israelite city, with which we are more immediately concerned. The actual digging in 1908, which went on for nine weeks, was productive of ample results, though not of the period especially desired, most of the finds belonging to the Gr.eco-Roman period. Five trial pits were dug near the modern village of Sebastiyeh,



EXCAVATIONS IN NORTH i'ALESTINE 247
which resulted in the discovery of a large building, the northern end of which was excavated; the masonry was excellent, and the blocks of stone used of considerable size. The original building was evidently a temple of Roman times, the later structure, one of the chief features of which was a broad curve suggestive of the apse of a church, belonging pro

bably to the Byzantine period. A large number of Arabic lamps, quantities of Roman roof tiles, together with some Greek and Roman pottery and broken glass, were found here. Excavations on the citadel itself were, however, productive of more important results. At a depth of 30 feet below the surface a massive wall consisting of large stones, five courses of which

are still in position, was brought to light; unfortunately, as this discovery was made towards the end of the season's work, it was too late to follow it up that year, but the fact that it lay buried beneath some 30 feet of debris appeared to indicate that it belonged to Hebrew times and was made by Hebrew masons, while further evidence of its Hebrew origin was forthcoming in the discovery of similar stones in the immediate neighbourhood, bearing marks such as have been found elsewhere, and which have been regarded as betokening a Hebrew parentage. Another trench brought to light two cisterns, a plastered stone drain, and the remains of ancient buildings, while a further trench revealed a stairway ascending from the north, 16 steps of which were partially uncovered, the top step being 5 feet below the surface (cf. Fig. 95). The blocks of stone composing the stairway are about one yard long, and are alike well cut and well laid ; the stairway was originally 80 feet wide, the shortest step now measuring 57 feet and the longest about 73 feet. At the foot of the stairway is a supporting wall of rude masonry about 8 feet high, and perhaps of earlier date. About 12 feet south of the stairway, and a foot or so below the surface, a platform composed of thick slabs of stone was discovered, 57 feet in length and 27 feet in breadth, while beneath the platform remains of earlier walls were found. In a trench running south, at a depth of 3 feet, was found a large piece of mosaic floor, a deep cistern, and crude but massive walls. On the west of the stairway a large chamber, about 40 feet by 20 feet, was excavated, the top of which is on a level with the lowest step, and the northern wall of which is in line with the northern wall supporting

earth beneath. A few graffiti were recovered, and many fragments of Latin inscriptions on pieces of marble slabs, but the only sculptures were a Roman torso, finely carved out of a block of white marble and probably representing Augustus, and portions of an unknown head of colossal size. A short distance north of the stairway a Roman altar was found, and



25c THE LATEST LIGHT ON lllllLE LA:-IDS
on the west of the altar two large blocks of stone were discovered bearing the characteristically Hebrew marks already alluded to, while in a pit not far from the altar, a column, cut out of the rock, nearly round and about a yard in diameter, still stands in position. Fragments of coloured stucco were found here, with Greek letters scratched on them. In 1909 excavations were resumed on May 31, and continued till November 14. As in 1908, the chief interest centred round the summit; a wall was discovered which Reisner at the time believed to be part of the Palace of Omri and Ahab, while Pere Vincent, a leading authority on Palestinian archa:ology, shared the same opinion. In a chamber beneath the palace several fragments of pottery inscribed in Hebrew were found, while south of the palace a fragment of cuneiform inscription with a Hebrew seal-stamp was brought to light; traces of an ancient Hebrew tower were also discovered, and the remains of the wall of the ancient Israelite city were found on the edge of the lower terrace, the western gateway of the city being at the same time discovered. But the excavations of 1910 are those which have produced by far the most important and the most positive results, so far as Hebrew history is concerned, and have effected the identification of the architectural remains of Omri and his notorious son Ahab. On archa:ological grounds the excavators had already assigned the remains in question to the period of Israel's hey-day, and the discovery of an alabaster vase inscribed with the name of Osorkon II., confirmed their opinion. Osorkon, King of Egypt, was the contemporary of Shalmaneser II., King of



EXCAVATIONS IN NORTH PALESTINE 153
Assyria (860-825 B.C.), and was, therefore, the contemporary of Ahab, whose relationship to Shalmaneser has already been discussed (cf. p. r 28). This discovery is of supreme value owing to the disturbance of the site in successive periods ·and the consequent difficulty of assigning dates to all that the excavations have brought to light.

Reisner further found a large number of ostraka inscribed with old Hebrew characters of a particularly fine type. These ostraka were found in the same stratum as that in which the alabaster vase was discovered. They comprise some seventy-five fragments of pottery inscribed with records in the old Hebrew script. Dr. Lyon has shown that the inscriptions were written on sherds originally, and not on complete jars, for, in the first place, the beginnings

and endings of the lines were clearly adapted to the dimensions of the fragment, in consequence of which the lines were sometimes crowded towards the end, while sometimes the words at the end of a line are divided, the second half being carried on to the succeeding line. Secondly, the writing "crosses the turning lines on the fragment at various angles," whereas labels written on jars are horizontal. Thirdly, several of the fragments, each bearing a separate and complete inscription, fit together, and were therefore originally part of the same jar ; but a jar would not require or have more than one label. Dr. Lyon, indeed, mentions two cases where the inscriptions appear to have been labels written on the original jars themselves, but he adds that they exhibit peculiarities not found on the other potteryfragments, for, in the first place, the two inscriptions alluded to are very short, and secondly, there is in either case a large amount of blank unwritten surface. The inscriptions are written in ink with a reed pen, and the script is, ~f course, the early Hebrew, which was practically identical with Phcenician as well as with that employed on the Moabite stone and the Siloam inscription. The writing is easy and flowing in style, and is much more graceful than the stone-incised Phcenician inscriptions, as might indeed be expected from the adoption of clay, ink, and a reed as writing materials, instead of a chisel and hard stone. The ink has stood the combined test of time and climate in the most extraordinary manner, and, in the majority of cases, there is no doubt as to the reading. The ostraka, generally speaking, seem to be labels affixed to jars of wine and oil; they give the date--" ninth, tenth, or eleventh



256 THE LATEST LICHT ON BIBLE LANDS
year "-presumably of the reigning king, though unfortunately no king is actually mentioned, the name of the owner, and the contents of the jar, e.g. "old wine" or "clarified oil." The proper names found on these ostraka are of the greatest interest, for a considerable number of them occur in the Old Testament. Thus, to take a few of the most familiar, we have Abiezer, Ahimelek, Ahinoam, Elisha, Asa, Meribaal, Nathan, and Sheba. Some of the proper names which occur are compounded with "El," one of the Hebrew words for God ; " Baal " also forms a component part of not a few names, while Yo, generally regarded as an abbreviated form of the tetragrammaton (YHVH) (but cf. p. 192), Jehovah or Yahveh, also occurs in several of the names found in these inscriptions. Of the places mentioned, Shechem is probably the most familiar. The discovery of the ostraka is epoch-making, alike for the epigraphist and the Hebraist, for they are possibly the earliest examples of Hebrew writing which have as yet come to light, and in amount, as Dr. Lyon says, they far outstrip all the ancient Hebrew inscriptions at present known. As already indicated, the excavations in Palestine have yielded very few inscribed tablets or objects, and the value of the few is thereby enhanced. One of the most interesting of these is the small limestone tablet, discovered at Gezer (cf. Fig. 100). It measures 41⁄4 by 2{ inches, and bears an inscription of eight lines, written in the old Hebrew characters.*

EXCAVATIONS IN NORTH PALESTINE 257
The inscription itself, which has been independently translated by Prof. Lidzbarski, Dr. Gray, and Dr. Pilcher, and has also been dealt with by Prof. Ronzevalle, Dr. Daiches, Dr. G. A. Cooke, Prof. Dalman, Prof. Vincent, Prof. Marti, and other scholars, presents us with a list of the months, the names of which all relate to the agricultural operations which took place during the months in question. Thus one month is called the "month of fruit-harvest" (or "gathering in") ; another the " month of the flaxharvest," while a third is known as the "month of the barley-harvest." What object was served by this so-called "calendar-tablet" it is impossible to say. Lidzbarski and Pilcher regard it as the work of a peasant, who was proud of his ability to write, and was anxious to " show off" his powers in this direction. As will have been seen, the contents afford us no clue whatever in regard to the date of the tablet, and the only possibility of solving the problem lay in a critical examination of the script, an examination which has led most scholars to assign it to an early period, i.e. the eighth or ninth century B.C. Prof. Lidzbarski is of opinion that this tablet is "perhaps the oldest Hebrew inscription, at all events, one of the oldest of the Semitic inscriptions." Apart, however, from the Siloam inscription, the ostraka discovered at Samaria and elsewhere, and the limestone tablet from Gezer, there are other early objects inscribed with the old Hebrew characters which may be here mentioned. In the course of the excavations carried on by Professor Macalister and Dr. Bliss at Tell e~-$afi (Gath?), Tell ej-Judeideh, Tell Zakariya, Tell Sandal).annah, and Tell ej-Jezer s

(Gezer), some stamped jar-handles were brought to light, and a number of similar jar-handles, also inscribed in old Hebrew characters, were discovered by Sir C. Warren at Jerusalem. In like manner, the German excavations at Jericho yielded stamped jarhandles; but most of these belonged to the late Jewish or Hellenistic period, and were inscribed in Aramaic characters. Some of these later jar-handles from Jericho bear the divine name Yah or Yahu. The inscriptions on the Gezer jar-handles are very brief, but they are of considerable value from the epigraphical standpoint. They give us the names of the places where the vessels in question were respectively made, and read "Of" (or "For") "the King. Hebron" (" Ziph," etc.); and thus inform us that the vases of which these handles once formed a part were either the products of royal potteries situated at Hebron, Ziph, etc., or else that they were destined for the king, and were made at the places mentioned. Professors Sayce and Driver both favour the "royal pottery" theory,* in support of which the last-named scholar alludes to the sug
gestion of Pere Vincent t that the royal stamp may have served "as a guarantee of the capacity of the jar to which it was attached." Some, however, are stamped with private names. Apart from a number of Rhodian jar-handles of the Greek period, they would all appear to belong to the time of the Jewish monarchy, and are therefore more or less contemporaneous with the recently discovered ostraka at Samaria, the extreme importance of which has already been noted.

TAANACH.•
But Samaria, Israel's long-buried capital, has not been the only site in northern Palestine to command the attention of the excavator and the arch~ologist. In 1902 Prof. Sellin conducted an expedition to Tell Ta'annek, under the auspices of the Austrian Government and the Vienna Academy. The modern mound of Tell Ta'annek is situated in the plain of Esdraelon, and represents the site of the ancient Taanach. The first historical allusion to Taanach is contained in the annals of Thothmes III., where it finds a place together with Megiddo among the places captured by that king. Megiddo, which lies some five miles south-east of Taanach, is represented by the modern Tell el-Mutesellim, and the ruins of these two cities have yielded more epoch-making results than any other site in northern Palestine, Samaria alone excepted. In the Old Testament they are generally mentioned in close proximity to each other. Thus, in Joshua (xii. 21) they are both enumerated among the thirty-one cities whose kings were defeated by
Joshua, while in the song of Deborah (Judges v. 19) t "Taanach by the waters of Megiddo" is mentioned as the scene of the defeat of the Canaanite kings. Both again were included in the fifth administrative district of Solomon ( I Kings iv. 2 I). Some years later Taanach was plundered by Shishak, King of Egypt, during his campaign in

Syria, and Megiddo in her turn was the scene of Josiah's defeat at the hands of Pharaoh Necho. The importance of both these places was due to the strategical and commercial positions which they occupied on the main caravan routes between Egypt and Babylon. The early history of Taanach, as revealed by the excavations, has been divided into three periods, this division being based upon the different types of pottery discovered. Each period has been further subdivided into two. During the earlier half of the first period, which covers the period from 2000 to I 300 B.C., Taanach was occupied by the Canaanites ; this fact is attested by the pottery, which closely resembles that found on southern Palestinian ruins, in the strata representing the remains of the same period. One of the most interesting discoveries in the ruins belonging to the first period, was that of a number of cuneiform tablets-twelve in all-four of which were addressed to Ishtar-washur, the ruler of Taanach. In one despatch, lshtar-washur is requested or ordered to send troops, chariots, and a horse, as tribute, as well as presents to Aman-}:tashir at Megiddo,• which indicates that at this time Taanach owed allegiance to Megiddo. The author of another of these letters is one A!;iiyami, which may be the equivalent of the Biblical Ahijah ; if this be the case it would support the view to which other data in the inscriptions have been thought to point-that there were Israelites settled in Canaan before the Exodus.t

The employment of the Babylonian language as the lingua franca of the Oriental world at this period was, of course, already known from the recovery of the cuneiform tablets at Tell el-Amarna, but its use by Palestinian chiefs in correspondence with each other is a further illustration of the lasting influence of Babylonian civilization upon the inhabitants of the land of Amurru. No certain evidence was found of the existence of the neolithic troglodytes at Taanach, the earliest remains discovered being those of the Canaanitish period. A large building, presumably the residence of the Canaanite governor, Ishtar-washur, was uncovered, and it was in this building that the cuneiform tablets already alluded to were found. Close to this fortified building were two large caves, with a rock-hewn chamber in front and a rock-hewn altar above, which was connected by a conduit and winding stairs with the caves. It has been conjectured that the conduit was the means of conveying the sacrificial blood into the caves, where the dead were supposed to reside.• Close to another rock-hewn altar were found a number of jar-burials, most of which contained the remains of infants. This altar was provided with four cup-shaped hollows destined to receive the sacrificial blood. In another building, on the west of the mound, eight clay figures of the goddess Astarte, or Ashtoreth, were discovered (cf. Fig. 101). Generally speaking, they conform to the Phcenician types found at Cyprus and elsewhere, and show the goddess in the

nude, her two hands on her breasts, and her head surmounted by a lofty tiara. The second period of Taanach's history extends from I 200-800 B.C. • During the first half of this period Taanach,likeGezer, continued to be occupied by the Canaanites, and apparently did not pass into the possession of the Israelites until the reign of Solomon. The pottery belonging to the second half of this period betrays strong Phrenician influence. Among the more striking remains are the standing-stones or ma~~ebahs, some of which had cup-marked hollows (cf. further, p. 224). Terracotta figures of Astarte were found in the stratum representing this period, as in the stratum containing the remains of the first period. On the northeast of the mound the re

found at Gezer in the strata belonging to the period 1000-600 B.C., but much larger. The altar in question is about three feet high, the four sides at the bottom each measuring about eighteen inches, and the bowl at the top being about a foot in diameter. The decorations of the altar comprise a sacred tree, two lions, and three winged human-headed animals (the paws of the former resting on the heads of the latter), a boy, and a serpent. The altar is hollow, and the incense in the bowl on the top was apparently heated by a fire on the ground over which the altar was set. Among the smaller relics of interest discovered on this site may be mentioned the complete jewellery outfit of a woman : it comprises a gold pin, eight gold rings, two silver rings, two bronze bracelets, a silver bangle, three small crystal cylinders, five pearls, and two scarabs, one of which was amethyst and the other crystal. Nothing that can be assigned to the long period extending from 600 B.C.-900 A.D. has apparently been discovered, from which it may perhaps be inferred that some disaster befel the city at about the commencement of the sixth century B.C. The upper strata of the mound contained the ruins of a castle, and belong to the mediceval Arabic period, a fact attested by the objects found therein, one of which is an Arabic inscription.

same time (1903-1905) by Dr. Schumacher, under the auspices of the German Palestine Society. The principal mound was found to contain the remains of a fortress belonging to the period 25002000 B.c. Beneath the foundations was discovered the skeleton of a girl, who had doubtless been offered as a foundation-sacrifice, while other skeletons were found outside the walls, and also a trench which was filled wit!-. the remains of sacrifices. Close to the trench was an altar consisting in a menhir, near which stood a large stone bowl and a huge terracotta caldron, which was presumably used to cook the sacrificial meat ; cisterns for oil were also found near by, together with a number of standingstones. In the stratum assigned to the early half of the second millennium B.C. the remains of a strong city wall, over 26 feet thick and made of sun-dried bricks set on a foundation of masonry, were found. The town enclosed by this wall was burnt down, possibly by Thothmes III. (cf. p. 88). Amongst other architectural remains discovered on this site, may be mentioned a tower composed of hewn stone blocks in which were found various objects of bronze, including arrows, knives, and rings, a corner of a building constructed of large blocks of limestone and a temple, in one of the courts of which were two mazzebahs. Beneath one of the corners of this te~ple were four jars containing bones, deposited there in the late Israelite period. At a depth of from 26 to 32 feet two sepulchral chambers, built of stone and with vaulted roofs, were discovered, in one of which there were five skeletons, and in the other twelve. These graves are assigned

Outside the city an old "high place " is said to have been found, and also the stumps• of two upright wooden posts, surrounded with rubblestone at the base, which may possibly have served the same religious purpose as the heathen "asherahs" of the Old Testament.t The excavations at Megiddo also revealed a number of cup-shaped hollows cut in a large rock surface, some of which were connected with a subterranean cave (cf. the similar cup-shaped hollows above the caves at Gezer, p. 212). Among the smaller relics recovered, the lionseal bearing an inscription in old Hebrew characters, " Belonging to Shama', servant of Jeroboam," is deserving of special note. Kautzsch,i in a discussion of the seal, thinks that this is possibly King Jeroboam II., circ. 783-743 B.C. It will have been noted that at Taanach the remains of only three early cities can be clearly distinguished, the first two of which were destroyed by fire, possibly by Thothmes III. and Necho respectively, but that the site continued to be occupied right down to media!val times. At Megiddo, on the

other hand, the remains of seven early cities have been traced, the most ancient of which has been assigned to the third millennium n.c., and was occupied by a neolithic people. In regard to the earlier period of Palestine civilization, the excavations at Gezer, Lachish, Jericho, and Beth-Shemesh in the south, and those conducted at Megiddo and Tanaach in the north, have yielded much the same results. The same pottery scale holds good in both cases, and the same periods are traceable in the north and the south. The presence of pala!olithic man in Palestine-north and southis attested by a number of rudely-chipped flints discovered in the maritime plain, the Juda'!an mountains, the caves of Phcenicia, and the valleys of Samaria,"' and flints found in the territory on the east of the Jordan afford similar evidence of his existence in Petra and other trans-Jordanic districts, while to this period most of the cave settlements in Phcenicia have also been assigned. The principal means of subsistence at this time was apparently the chase, the animals hunted affording both meat for food and skins for clothing. The skins were sewn together by means of bone needles, many of which have been recovered. The date that has been assigned to the end of the pala!olithic and the commencement of the neolithic age is ro,ooo B.C. Little is known of the state of civilization in Palestine during the early half of the neolithic period, though some settlements in Phcenicia afford us a certain amount of information. The principal remains of this period are sherds of pottery and the bones of extinct fauna, e.g. the woolly rhinoceros. To the late neolithic period

belong the cave-dwellers at Gezer, who are supposed to have flourished about 3000 B.C. Their caves vary considerably in size and complexity, some of them containing more than twenty chambers. They were used for numerous purposes, including oil-presses and water-stores, as well as ordinary residences of the living and burial-places of the dead. These troglodytes belonged to a non-Semitic race of low stature, with thick skulls, and endowed with the muscularity generally seen among savage peoples. Their civilization was evidently of a rude character, hand-made pottery, flint implements, millstones and spindle-whorls being the principal utensils of daily life, while in contrast to their Semitic successors, they cremated their dead. Little is known of their religion beyond the inferences to be drawn from the cup-shaped hollows in the rock-surface at Gezer. It is interesting to note that in one of the_ caves associated with the cup-shaped hollows in the rock-surface above, pigbones were discovered, which may indicate that the pig was a pre-Semitic sacrificial animal, and Mac
alister suggestively remarks * that this may explain the peculiar detestation in which the pig has at all times been held by the Semites. The megalithic remains found in the J aulan, the J:Iauran, and the territory of Moab, together with a few on the west side of the Jordan, have also been assigned to this period. One of the most remarkable of the architectural products of this age are the five mastaba

children of Israel." They consist of long broad walls, in one of which a chamber and shaft have been made. At the time of the invasion of the Israelites south Palestine would appear to have been partially in the hands of tall races of non-Semitic origin. In the earliest narratives of the conquest, the "Anakim " are represented as inhabiting Hebron, whence they were driven out by Caleb, while another race of reputed giants, called the " Rephaim," were in occupation of territory on both sides of the Jordan (cf. further Enc. Bibl., iv. 4033). In any case we can hardly identify the descendants of the non-Semitic cave-dwellers of the neolithic period, who were short, as the excavations have proved, with the non-Semitic peoples encountered by Joshua, who were conspicuously tall. The invasion of the Hebrews was not, however, the first wave of Semitic immigration into Palestine. Many centuries before the time of Joshua (probably during the latter half of the third millennium) a Semitic people had established themselves, and had introduced a civilization in many ways superior to that of their non-Semitic predecessors, while this Semitic element would appear to have been further augmented by another Semitic expansion some few centuries later. The potter's wheel begins to appear at this time, and also bronze, though flint still continued to be used for ordinary purposes. At first the Semites lived in the caves which their forerunners had hollowed out at such infinite cost and labour, but they soon learned to build houses, consisting of small rooms and courtyards. The most conspicuous, or at all events the most



EXCi\VATIONS IN NORTH PALESTINE 271
enduring, element in the worship of the pre-Israelite Semitic populations are the standing-stones or ma~~ebahs which have already been under discussion (cf. p. 223). During the early part of the Semitic period Egypt exercised a considerable influence upon the civilization of Palestine; but by the time of the Israelite invasion the art and culture of Phcenicia, Crete, and Cyprus had even then made themselves felt, and they ultimately supplanted Egypt as an influential factor in Palestinian civilization. The political· power to which the Cretan settlers in Palestine had attained by the time of Joshua may be gauged by the fact that \he Philistines (the Purasati of the Egyptian inscriptions), who in all probablity had migrated to the land which bears their name (i.e. "Palestine"), shortly after the sack of Crete, their native land, were the principal tribe among the "Peoples of the Sea," whom Rameses III. defeated about 1200 B.C. (cf. p. II8). But although they were not able to match themselves against the land of the Pharaohs, they successfully maintained their position among the small Semitic tribes of Palestine, and it was not until the accession of David that the power of the Philistines was broken. But the termination of their political supremacy did not mean the cessation of their cultural influence, and the numerous relics of the period show how great was the debt which the Hebrews owed to the civilization of Crete. As Professor Macalister has well put it, "the Hebrews had no past to speak of, but were entering on the heritage they regarded as theirs, by right of a recently ratified divine covenant." In truth, the Hebrews made no contribution to the progress of civilization and displayed little originality, but have



2i2 THE LATEST LIGHT ON DIBLE LANDS
throughout their history shown a marked capacity for assimilating the intellectual and artistic atmosphere of their environment. It is all the more remarkable that a people that has played such a passive part in the history of civilization should have evolved a monotheism which, though originally personal and local in its theory, became ultimately universal in its application. One of the most significant features about the excavations in Palestine is that while they have yielded abundant evidence of both Egyptian and Cretan influence upon the art and culture of the inhabil;ants of Palestine, Babylonian influence is illustrated rather in the field of law, commerce, religion, and literature. It will have been remarked that the excavations carried on in Palestine have in the main a different bearing on the pages of the Old Testament from those which have been conducted in Mesopotamia and Egypt, the reason for this difference being that while Babylonia, Assyria, and Egypt have all yielded a large amount of documentary evidence to illustrate in various ways the Biblical narratives, Palestine has so far yielded practically no inscriptions, but she has, on the other hand, yielded a rich harvest of material for the reconstruction of the cultural history of the Israelite and pre-Israelite populations, and of the inheritance into which the former entered, and thus it is that the Biblical student owes a debt to the arch;;eologist as well as to the excavator and decipherer. The value of the inscriptions from Egypt and Mesopotamia lies in the fact that they are contemporaneous documents, and are therefore first-class



EXCAVATIONS IN NORTH PALESTINE 273
sources of information regarding the events which they record. It is, of course, true that the eastern kings were wont to ascribe to themselves the successes of their predecessors, and to exaggerate their own achievements, but the exaggerations are seldom of a character to affect the matter-of-fact statements which alone, as a rule, have any bearing on the history of Israel. The inscriptions throw a welcome light on much in the Old Testament. They bring to life for us the great civilizations of Babylonia, Assyria, and Egypt, They tell us much about their history, and so enable us to realize the background in which the history of Israel took place, and the influences under which they came. They show us how many of the customs and institutions of Israel were analogous to those of Babylonia, Phc:enicia, and other of their neighbours, though in Israel such of these as related to the practice of religion, in so far as they were adapted from their neighbours, were imbued by their religious teachers with the spirit of their own faith, and made the vehicle of great spiritual truths. They also often throw light on terms occurring in the Old Testament, which but for them would be altogether obscure (e.g. "Pharaoh," the "Tartan," the "Rabsaris," the " Rabshakeh," the god " Rimmon," ma;p;ebiilts, the "Rephaim" or" Shades" (Isa. xiv. 9, R.V. m., and elsewhere-as in Phc:enician)). They are also interesting as stating facts about Palestine not mentioned in the Old Testament at all, and which without them would be unsuspected (e.g. Palestine being an Egyptian province shortly before the Exodus, and the intercourse with other nations which influenced its culture, as attested by the excavations at Gezer T



274 THE LATEST LIGHT ON DIBLE LANDS
and elsewhere). They are also of great value in fixing the chronology. It is of great importance to know the king who built Pithom, for instance; and they fix the chronology of the kings where the Biblical record is certainly confused.• On parts of the history of the kings they throw great light ; they enable us, for instance, to understand far better than we could otherwise have done, the political position of Judah in the days of Isaiah, the motives which led the people now to submit to Assyria, now to rely upon Egypt and the policy of the prophet.t We must not, however, expect too much from the monuments. So far as they are at present known they do not do more than mention a few isolated facts out of all that are recorded in the Bible. We must remember that, with the exception of the statement of Menephthah that " Israel is desolated," the first event in the history of Israel or its ancestors
certainly t attested by the inscriptions is the invasion of Judah by Shishak under Rehoboam, and the first Israelites whom they mention by name are Omri and Ahab. The conclusions on all the earlier history of the Hebrews which they justify are thus largely indirect and inferential. There is nothing bearing directly on Abraham, for instance, in the cuneiform inscriptions, though a fair case has been made out for the
* Ahab was on the throne in 854 e.c. ; and the expedition or Sennacherib took place twenty-one years (not eight years, as in 2 Kings xviii. 13, compared with v. ro) after the fall of Samaria. The Assyrian chronology is certain from 902 n.c., every year having an officer, who, so to say, gave it his name.

EXCAVATIONS IN NORTH PALESTINE 275
identification of some of the four kings from the East, mentioned in Gen. xiv. (cf. p. 53 f.). In the later period they do not uniformly bear out the Biblical statements. Thus while the Biblical account of the capture of Samaria by the King of Assyria has been fully corroborated, Sargon was the king who took the city, and not Shalmaneser, as the Old Testament would lead us to suppose. Again, nothing is known from the inscriptions of "Darius the Mede" (cf. Dan. v. 31), who is said to have taken the kingdom on the demise of Belshazzar, while in the inscription of Cyrus, Nabonidus is King of Babylon to the end, Belshazzar being referred to in the inscriptions of Nabonidus in terms which suggest that he was his father's general or viceroy.* Where the inscriptions merely corroborate Biblical statements or narratives of which the historical accuracy has never been questioned, they cannot indeed be said to throw any new material light on the Old Testament, but very frequently they afford additional information or further details, which sometimes set before us more accurately the course of events. Much has been done, but the ruined mounds of Babylonia and Assyria, of Egypt and Palestine have many a tale yet to unfold, and the truism in regard to all human affairs holds good in this case also-"we know not what a day may bring forth."

APPENDIX A
THE NORTH-SEMITIC INSCRIPTIONS
THE North-Semitic Inscriptions are so called to dis. tinguish them from the South-Semitic, or Sab::ean and Himyaritic on the one hand, and from the Babylonian and Assyrian on the other." They comprise the Phrenician, Hebrew, Moabite, and Aramaic inscriptions, all of which are written in varieties of the same alphabetic script. The
origin of this script is still a matter of speculation. t Until
recently the favourite view was that the Phrenicians derived it from the Egyptian, either directly from the hieroglyphs or else from the hieratic-the later cursive script of the priests.:j: Others have sought to trace its origin to the cuneiform writing of the Babylonians and Assyrians, and both of these views represent traditions which were in vogue in classical times.§ Another theory is that the Phcenician characters were derived from the early Cypriote writing; but at present none of these theories is without objection, and we must be content to leave the matter in a state of uncertainty until more light is forthcoming. The North-Semitic inscriptions, with one or two exceptions, belong to the period extending from the ninth century B.c. to the third century A.D. As indicated elsewhere, both the language and the script in which they are written bear a close resemblance to old Hebrew, as illustrated on the Siloam inscription, the ostraka from Samaria, and the jar-handles from Gezer, Jericho, and elsewhere. Their interest to the epigraphist is therefore

considerable, while without a knowledge of the historical evolution of the Phrenician characters-characters practically identical with those in which the earlier portions of the Old Testament were originally written-many of the textual errors perpetuated in the oldest extant Hebrew manuscripts (which belong to the ninth and tenth centuries
A.D.) would remain inexplicable. It is at once obvious that from the purely epigraphic standpoint, the importance of these inscriptions is not affected either by the place of their discovery or by their contents. Their interest is not, however, solely epigraphic, for they give us some insight into the daily life of the various peoples to whom they refer, and by whom they were written, while a few of them were dedicated to or by historical personages, and many of them are dated by the reigns of
kings.·~ The area of the North-Semitic inscriptions extends from N. Syria to N. Arabia, and on the west it reaches to Egypt, Carthage, Cyprus, and Asia Minor. The earliest Phrenician inscription found in Phrenicia itself belongs to the Persian age (5th-4th century B.c).t It was discovered at Gebal or Byblus, which lies between Tripoli and Beirut, and was dedicated by Yei)aw-milk, the King of Gebal, to the patron-goddess of the city. After having referred to his divine appointment, Yei)aw-milk records the objects which he herewith dedicates to the mistress of Gebal, and invokes her blessing : "May the mistress of Gebal bless Yei)aw-milk, King of Gebal, and grant him life, and prolong his days . . . give [him] favour . . . in the eyes of the people of this land." The language and phraseology in this inscription, as in so many of the North-Semitic inscriptions, bear a close resemblance to expressions contained in the Old Testament (cf. Deut. iv. 40, etc.; Gen. xxxix. 21, etc.).
One of the most interesting of all the N Orth-Semitic inscriptions from the historical standpoint is the stele of Zkr, King of Hamath (about 800 B.c.), first published by

Pognon, in the Inscriptions Semitiques de la Syrie, de la Mesopotamie et de la region de Mossoul (1907-8).-~ Zkr states that he erected this stele to commemorate his triumph over the seventeen kings whom I::Iazael, King of Aram, had united against him. Zkr was King of I::Iamath am.I L'sh. One of the allies was the King of Sam'al, a country in North Syria, which is mentioned several times in the cuneiform as well as in the Phamician inscriptions. It was at first independent, but became tributary in the reign of
Tiglath-Pileser III.t The attack made on Zkr's capital I::Iazrik was vigorous : they laid siege to I::Iazrik and erected a wall higher than the wa11 of I::Iazrik, and dug a trench deeper than the trench of I::Iazrik. But Ba'al-shamain came to the rescue of Zkr, and bade him " Fear not, for I have made thee king, and I will rescue thee from all these kings who have besieged thee." The mention of Ba'al-shamain
(= "lord of heaven") is of interest, as formerly there was
no evidence of the cult of this god before the 3rd-rnd
centuries B.c.:j: The writing and language of this inscription are similar to those of the Zinjirli inscriptions, and the Aramaic is tinged with noticeable Hebraisrns.§ In Syria, as elsewhere, there is evidence of the practice of writing inscriptions on statues. A good example of such an inscription is afforded by the colossal statue of Hadad at Zinjirli in N.W. Syria. The characters, which are archaic and resemble those found on the Moabite Stone,!I are in relief. The statue and its dedicatory inscription are due to Panammu I., son of QRL, King of Ya'di in N. Syria:-" I am Panammu, son of QRL, King of Ya'di, ,vho have set up this statue to Hadad.... Moreover, I sat upon the seat of my father, and Hadad gave into my hand the sceptre

of? . . . And in my days Ya'di (?) did both eat and drink."* Another inscription also on a statue discovered at Zinjirli, and dedicated by Bar-rekub to his father, Panammu II., the successor of Panammu I., is of special interest, owing to the fact that it contains a mention of TiglathPileser III., King of Assyria, 745-727 n.c. "Moreover my father Panammu died while following his lord TiglathPileser, King of Assyria, in the camp, also . . . and his kinsfolk bewailed him(?), and the whole camp of his lord
the King of Assyria bewailed him." t
Stelre and statues were, however, not the only objects inscribed with Phcenician characters ; sometimes the sarcophagi of royalties and grandees were similarly inscribed. One of the best-known of these is that of Eshmun-'azar, King of Sidon, about 300 B.c.+ The sarcophagus itself betrays Egyptian influence, and it bears an inscription of twentytwo lines. After lamenting his untimely end, Eshmun-'azar
adjures § "every prince and every man that they open not this resting-place, nor seek with me jewels for there are no jewels with me there, nor take away the coffin of my restingplace. . . . For every prince and every man who shall open this resting-place, or who shall take away the coffin of my resting-place, or who shall carry me from this resting-place, may they have no resting-place with the Shades, nor be buried in a grave, nor have son or seed in their stead.... For I am to be pitied(?); I have been seized before my time, the son of a (short) number of days ... an orphan, the son of a widow am I." He then refers to the good works which he and his forebears have accomplished. "And we (are they) who built houses for the gods of the Sidonians in Sidon, the land of the sea, a house for the Ba'al of Sidon, and a house for 'Ashtart, the name of Ba'al, And further, the Lord of kings gave to us D6r and Yafe. the glorious corn lands which are in the field of Sharon, in accordance with the great things which I did; and we

added them to the borders of the land, that they might belong to the Sidonians for ever." He then winds up with a final warning to any one who might be tempted to disturb his remains-" lest these holy gods deliver them up, and cut off that prince and those men, and their seed, for ever ! " II is interesting to note that the word here used for "shades "-Rephaim-is frequently used in the Old Testament with the same connotation. Thus in Job xxvi. 5 we read, 11 The Rephairn (see R.V. rnarg.) tremble beneath the waters and the denizens thereof;" in Psalm Ixxxviii. 10, again, we read, "Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? Shall the Rephairn (see R.V. rnarg.) arise and praise thee?" In Prov. ii. 18; ix. 18; xxi. 16, the same term is applied to the shades of the nether world; while in Isa. xiv. 9, the prophet says: 11 Sheol (R.V. 11 hell "-of course in the old
sense of the word = Hades) from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy corning; it stirreth up the Rephaim (R.V. rnarg.) for thee;" and in Isa. xxvi. 14, "The dead live not; the Rephairn rise not" (see R. V. marg.). Lastly, in Jsa. xxvi. 19 we read, " and the earth shall cast forth the Rephaim (R. V. 'the dead')." Another sarcophagus of similar workmanship to the foregoing, and belonging to Tabnith, the father of Eshmun'azar has also been recovered. The inscription in this case is considerably shorter, but the purport is exactly the same." "I, Tabnith, priest of 'Ashtart, King of the Sidonians, son of Eshmun-'azar, priest of 'Ashtart, King of the Sidonians, lie in this coffin; my (curse be) with whatsoever man thou art that bringest forth this coffin." The abject horror with which Eshmun-'azar and Tabnith view the possibility of their remains being disturbed, and their peace molested, recalls the Babylonian belief that the shades of the unburied could never reach Arallu, but were compelled to wander as vagabonds upon the face of the earth, while for food and drink they had to content themselves with the offal on the streets. Many coins also inscribed with Phcenician characters have been discovered at Tarsus, in Cilicia, Cyprus, Phcenicia, and elsewhere. The most interesting for our immediate

purpose are those which are Jewish. They belong to three periods : (1) the period of the Hasmon:ean princes (from 135-37 n.c.); (2) the first revolt against the Romans,
A.D. 66-70; (3) the second revolt, A.D. 132-135. The use of the old Phcenician characters among the Jews at so late a period, "marks," as Cooke says, "the efforts that were made to maintain or assert the independence of the nation," for the earlier writing had long since given place to the square characters of Aramaic origin. As to the antiquity of the Phrenician characters, it was supposed till recently that the earliest known did not date
back farther than the ninth century n.c. ; but Dr. Ball * has drawn attention to a Semitic inscription written in Phcenician characters, and reproduced in Petrie's Sinai (p. 130, Fig. 139, and cf. Fig. 141). The inscription in question is on one side of the base of a small sphinx, and contains the name 'Athtar. From this inscription it is clear that the Phcenician alphabet was known in the Sinaitic Peninsula in the time of Thothmes III. (i.e., on any reckoning, as early as 1500-1447 B.c.). This inscription thus affords conclusive evidence of the use of the Phc:enician characters in the Sinaitic Peninsula in the fifteenth century B.C. or earlier, and they must certainly have been known in Palestine at least as early as that time. Under these circumstances the statement in the Introduction to Naville's The Discoz•e1J' of the Book of the Law (p. viii., 19u), that " arch:eological research has now made it clear that the so-called Phcenician alphabet was not introduced into Palestine until the age of David," is incorrect, for such arch:eological evidence as there is would tend to show that the Phcenician alphabet was known in Palestine some centuries before the time of David.t From these few remarks it will be at once recognized that though the North-Semitic inscriptions are of the utmost importance in the study of Semitic epigraphy, often illustrate in a very wP-lcome manner the language, usages, and ideas of the Old Testament, they throw comparatively little light on the historical or quasi-historical statements contained in the Bible.

APPENDIX B
THE HITTITES
THE racial origin of the Hittites is somewhat problematic, although there is no doubt as to the district whence they came. Their home lay in Cappadocia, in Asia Minor. Until recently our knowledge of them was derived almost entirely from fragmentary notices in the Old Testament (see below) ; but now fortunately one can refer to numerous contemporaneous documents and monuments of their own civilization. The most epoch-making event in their early history would appear to have been their invasion of Babylon, which resulted in the downfall of the first dynasty of Babylon, (about 1800 B.c.). A few centuries later we find them playing a conspicuous part in the Syrian campaigns of the XVlllth and XIXth dynasty kings of Egypt (in the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries B.c.).* They were not in occupation of Carchemish when Thothmes I. (c. 1550 B.c.) waged war in Northern Syria ; but the extent of their power in the reign of Thothmes III. (c. 1480 B.c.), may be gauged by the fact that the Egyptians refer to them as the " Greater Khiiti," while in spite of the fact that Thothmes received presents from them, he does not seriously lay any claim to sovereignty.over them. Of their. aggressive attitude in the reigns of Amen):ietep III. and Amen):ietep IV. (c. 14141365 B.c.), we have evidence in the Tell el-Amarna letters, from which we gather that all the malcontents in Syria who wished to emancipate themselves from Egyptian suzerainty

APPENDIX B
invoked the aid of the Hittites as a matter of course. Thus Abdashirti and his son Aziru applied to them for chariots and men, and Aziru is at pains to give the Egyptian monarch an adequate explanation of his reception of the Hittite envoys on the one hand, and his rejection of the Egyptian messengers on the other. Towards the end of the XVIIIth dynasty, Egyptian power in Syria began to decline, and the southward advance of the Hittites was thereby rendered more easy. Rameses I., the first king of the XIXth dynasty, found it desirable to make terms with Saparuru, the chief of the Kheta (cf. p. 108), while Seti I., his son and successor, had occasion to make a vigorous attack on them, and is generally supposed* to have captured their stronghold, J:;:.adesh on the Orontes ; but however that may be, we know that by the time of Rameses II. (Petrie, 1300-1234 R.c. ; Breasted, r 292-r 2 25 B.c.), they had firmly established themselves at ~adesh, and after prolonged struggles Rameses thought it expedient to conclude a treaty with them ; the Egyptian copy of this treaty has long been known, but comparatively recently a cuneiform precis has been discovered at Boghaz Keui in Cappadocia. This treaty is of great interest, as the earliest treaty known to history, and is remarkable as showing how far even at this relatively early date the art of diplomacy had reached, and what careful provision was made for the various contingencies that might arise. Meanwhile the Assyrians had become an influential factor in Western affairs, and their interests soon collided with those of the Hittites. From the Boghaz Keui tablets (see Winckler in Mitteil. d. Deutsch. Orient Gesellschajt., 1907) we gather that the hostile relationship between the t11·0 peoples began at all events as early as the reign of
Shalmaneser I. (c. fourteenth century B.c.). The Hittites, however, held their own down to late Assyrian times. Their power was indeed felt all over North Syria and even in Mesopotamia, while the "land of the Hittites" was an expression used by the Assyrian kings from Shalmaneser II. to include, apparently, the whole of Palestine.

APPENDIX B 285
In the reign of Ashur-na~ir-pal (885-860 B.c.), Carchemish was very wealthy, and its renown in commerce was long perpetuated in Asia by the use of weight-measures called in the cuneiform inscriptions the "maneh of Carchernish." But finally in 717 B.C. Sargon captured Carchemish, deposed Pisiris, its king, and reduced it to the unenviable position of an Assyrian prefecture.
The Hittites in the Old Testament
(1) The name of a great nation in the north (1 Ki. x. 28; 2 Ki. vii. 6).* CL also Josh. i. 4, where we read that the Promised Land was to extend " from the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites;" where "all the land of the Hittites" seems to refer to the region between Lebanon and the Euphrates. (Carchemish (the modern Jerablus or Jerabls; Geo. Smith first identified the site in 1876), the ancient southern Hittite capital, is mentioned three times in the Old Testament (Is. x. 9; 2 Ch. xxxv. 20; Jer. xlvi. 2), but is not explicitly associated with the Hittites, and as Dr. Hogarth points out, this is not surprising in view of the fact that Carchemish was no longer under Hittite sway at the time of the Old Testament references. (2) Settlements or off-shoots in North Palestine. See
Josh. xi. 3, "And the Hittites t under I:Ierrnon in the land
of Mii:pah" ; Ju. iii. 3, "And the Hittites t that dwelt in
Mount Lebanon, from Mount Ba'al-I:Iermon unto the
entering in of I:Iamath." Ct~ also Ju. i. 2 6 (unless this belongs to (1)); perhaps these are the" Hittites" referred to in Gen. x. 15 (as" son" of Cana'an, next to Zidon). (3) In rhetorical lists of nations driven out by Israel, from which nothing can be inferred as to their locality (Ex. iii. 8, 17 ; xiii. 5 ; xxiii. 2 3, and elsewhere). (4) The Hittites in I:Iebron (only in" P ") (Gen. xxiii. and passages referring to this). If the tradition is correct, there must have been a settlement of them here; but there
• Possibly also 2 Sam. xxiv. 6 (see Index, under J:Cadesh).
t So read with LXX for Hivite (with Hivite for Hit/lie, also as
LXX, in the previous clause); the Hivites were a tribe in Central Palestine (Gen. xxxiv. 2, in Shechem; Josh. ix. 7; xi. 19, in Gibe'on).
t So read for Hivites, for the reason given in the last note (*).



APPENDIX B
is at present no cc,·tai'n independent evidence of their presence in South Palestine (cf. pp. 57-59). Sayce's picture of Hittite princes carving out for themselves principalities in South Palestine (Archaology of tlze Cuneiform Inscriptions,
p. 197 f.) is purely conjectural. It is possible, however,
that when the inhabitants of l:{ebron are called "children of I:Ieth," the writer only means to describe them as Canaanites,• and the fact that Esau's wives are called both "daughters of I:Ieth" and "daughters of Canaan" has
been held to support this view, but t "Canaan " seems here to be rather the generic term, and " I:Ieth" the specific. If this view be correct, the Hittite origin of Esau's wives will imply that there was a Hittite element in Edom. Tiglath-Pileser III. and Sargon (745-705 B.c.) also both
mention a tribe I:Iatha ( = Hittites?) in N. Arabia, while
the name of Abdi-Khiba (governor of Jerusalem, c. 1450 B.c.) contains the name of a Hittite goddess. These facts, apart from the evidence of the pottery (cf. pp. 57-59), suggest independently that there may have been Hittites in or near the south of Palestine, though, it is true, at periods considerably later than that of Abraham.
Hittite Monuments.
Various monuments and relics discovered in Asia Minor, Korth Syria, and even in Assyria have long been recognized as Hittite in origin. The best known of these are the five basaltic blocks bearing hieroglyphic inscriptions in relief, found at I:Iamath on the Orontes, the inscribed rock-sculpture
at Ivriz in s.,v. Cappadocia, various rock-monuments at
Euyu.k and Boghaz Keui in N. Cappadocia, the stone lions from Marash in E. North Syria and Tell Ahmar, on the left bank of the Euphrates, and a number of clay sealings from Kouyunjik (Nineveh), all of which were found to be inscribed in similar characters. Nothing certainly Hittite has
• Cf. Gray, Numbers, p. 148. It is true that in Ezekiel (xvi. 3)
Jerusalem is said to h':ve h'.'d an Amorite fat~er and a Hittite moth_er,
but this proves nothrng ; 1f taken lzterally 1t proves too much, viz., that the people of Jerusalem were entirely of foreign extraction; it is meant obviously in a moral sense--they were morally no better than descendants of a Canaanite ancestor. ·

APPENDIX B
been discovered on any West Asian site (with the exception of the Kara-Bel monuments), while most of the Hittite monuments have been found in the region of Cappadocia, S. Phrygia, and Commagene. (The only Hittite monument (apart from the Hamah stones) from Mid-Syria is a fragment of an inscription discovered by Pere Ronzavalle at Res/an (Arethusa) on the middle Orantes.) But it is only within the last few years that the ruined mounds which conceal tht remains of their long-extinguished empire have engaged the serious attention of the excavator and the archreologist. The most recent excavations in the land of the Hittites are those of Winckler, Garstang, Hogarth, and Max Freiherr v. Oppenheim. In 1906 Winckler undertook the excavation on Boghaz Keui. In 1908 the University of Liverpool sent out an expedition under Garstang to Sakjegeuzi (about 60 m. due N. of Aleppo), which resulted in the complete exploration of one mound
(Jobba), and the partial exploration of two others, including Songrus, the largest. In 19u Hogarth commenced excavations at Jerablus (Carchemish) on behalf of the trustees of the British Museum, while in 1912 Max Freiherr v. Oppenheim began work at Tell Halaf. Among the more interesting discoveries that have been made at Boghaz Keui are two series of rock-reliefs, one of which comprised over sixty separate figures, and a number of inscriptions, some of which are written in the Hittite hieroglyphics, while a large number of cuneiform tablets, some of which are written in Babylonian and others in the native language, were also brought to light. These tablets refer to the reigns of at least four Hittite kings, from Saparuru, the contemporary of Rameses I., to Kheta-sar, the king who concluded a treaty with Rameses II. No Hittite inscriptions were found at Sakjegeuzi; but a few small Hittite objects were recovered, and also some pottery ranging from neolithic to late Hittite time. Dr. Hogarth informs me that he thinks Sakjegeuzi is not the site of a Hittite settlement, but that it may have belonged to the Commageni, who were strongly influenced by Hittite civilization. In a large fortified building unearthed by Garstang, various Egyptian objects belonging to the ninth



288 APPENDIX B
or eighth centuries n.c. were brought to light, and a number of wall bas-reliefs were also revealed. At Carchemish (Jerablus) a considerable number of sculptured and inscribed monuments were unearthed. Most of the sculptures belong to the tenth or ninth centuries B.c., while the quantity of sculptured and inscribed fragments, which represent more than 100 new texts, bear eloquent testimony to the thoroughness with which the Assyrians did their work of destruction when they captured the city in 7I7 n.c. A large water-gate was found leading to the Euphrates, the sides of which were lined with bas-reliefs, and the entrance to which was flanked by two inscribed stone lions. As in the case of the block of buildings excavated at the foot of the Acropolis on the S.W., this gateway, as also the sculptures with which it was decorated, show two periods, the earlier work being Cappadocian in character, and the later, Mesopotamian. As at Sakjegeuzi, remains of the neolithic period were brought to light, these being found some fifty feet below the hl.lmmit of the Acropolis mound, and consisting in flints and painted sherds.
_·\fter sacking the city in 717 B.c., the Assyri:ms erected a fortress on the northern end of the Acropolis, composed of crude brickwork, but having a stone fai,ade, while the remains of an interesting building of later date have been laid bare on the southern end of the Acropolis. This building proves to have been a massive temple belonging to the Roman period. During the same expedition, the ruins of the important post-Assyrian city, which was occupied down to the Arab period, were examined. A number of graves were found on the site, most of which belong to later Hittite period; pot-burials were, however, also discovered, and these are no doubt to be assigned to the earlier Cappadocian times.
Hittite Art.
Hittite art, as illustrated on the rock sculptures, the bas-reliefs, the various intaglios (mostly of steatite) and the pottery,* is distinctive. While often betraying foreign

painted with dark ornament ; (b) polychrome on a cream white slip ; (c) black burnished.

muscles are exaggerated. Human beings are always of the brachycephalic (short-headed) type, while the nose is long, the lips thick, an<l the forehead receding (a different type appears on many late Carchemish monuments, but it is probable that Aram.r.ans and not Hittites are represented on these). The hair of males is nearly always done up in the form of a pig-tail. The head-dresses and clothing of the figures vary considerably, thus on the rock-sculpture of hriz the humanly-conceived god wears a horned cap, while a conical-shaped hat is seen on sculptures from Boghaz Keui, and both of these are in turn entirely different from the so-called "jockey cap" found on the " Tar-udimme" silver boss. In regard to dress, the broad-bordered mantle and the up-turned shoes would appear to be characteristically Hittite, as they are only found on monuments where Hittites are portrayed. The subjects of the sculptures are generally processions of human and divine figures ; sacrificial scenes are also represented as well as hunting scenes, but the field of battle does not appear to have often engaged the attention
of the Hittite sculptors, though warriors occur on the Carchemish monuments. Sculptured stel::e (;the tops of which are always rounded or pyramidal) generally only show one or two figures, human or divine, as the case may be.
The best examples of sculpture in the round are the sphinxes which flanked the entrance of the palace at Euyuk, and the lions of Marash and Arslan Tash ; but like Ashurna~ir-pal's lion and the Assyrian winged human-headed colossi, they are not completely disengaged from the block out of which they are carved.
Among the smaller relics recovered were some carved ivories and toilet instruments from Zinjirli, and some jewellery from Tell Halaf.
Buildings.
The architectural remains which have been so far discovered are few, but some of these are considerable. The ground-plans of a large building-apparently a palacethree temples and fortification-walls, the entrance, or one



APPENDIX B
or the entrances to which consisted in a sculptured gate, were revealed at Boghaz Keui. The palace, or which only the rough core of the walls, standing to about three feet, remains, was built round a central court, and the door, by means of which access was gained to the court, consisted of three bat/ants, suspended on two columns. As Hogarth says, the whole plan recalls the Cretan palaces of the late Minoan period. The fortifications of the citadel have a double gate with flanking towers; this gate is similar to the gates at Zinjirli and Euyuk, and was apparently designed for the purpose of entrapping an unwary enemy, who, having burst through the first door, found his further progress barred by a second door, and himself enclosed in a trap where the warriors on the gate-towers could dispatch him at their leisure.
The palace at Zinjirli is similar to that at Boghaz Keui, being rectangular in shape, and built around a central hall. The inner walls are lined with sculptured dado bas-reliefs, as appears to have been the case in most of the palaces of the Hittites. The columns, which are believed to have been made of wood, stood on stone bases carved as winged lions. The remains of large buildings or blocks of buildings have in like manner been discovered at Jerablus and Sakjegeuzi, while the sculptured porticoes lined with basreliefs at the last-named place, and also at Tell Halaf, deserve a special mention.
Hittite Inscriptions.
The Hittite hieroglyphs have not as yet been deciphered, though doubtless they are nearer decipherment than they were, thanks to the unremitting efforts of Jensen, and particularly Professor Sayce. The individual signs represent a variety of objects, including the severed heads of human beings and animals, articles of clothing, and implements or weapons.

PLACE-NAME INDEX
NOTE.
IN the following index of Old Testament place-names, the writer has consulted the leading authorities on Palestinian topography, including in
particular G. A. Smith (The Historical Geography of tl,e Holy Land,
Jentsalem, and articles in Encyclopmdia Biblica, Hastings' Dictionary of
the Bible, and elsewhere), F. Buhl (Geograpl,ie des a/ten Paliistina, Guthe
(Kurzcs Bibel-Wdrterbuch, 1903, and Bibe!atlas, 1911), and the topographical
articles in Hastings' D.B., and in the EncycloptJ!dia Biblica (not all of equal value; and many in both, for different reasons, to be followed with caution ; the reader must !earn to discriminate). He has also from time
to time referred to the Biblical Researches in Palestine (3 vols. ed. 2, 1856) of the great explorer Edw. Robinson, and to various articles by C. R. Conder and other members of the Palestine Exploration Fund staff in the
Q.S.P.E.F., and elsewhere. He has also naturally made use of the best and most recent critical commentaries on the Old Testament, especially
those in the International Critical Commentaries series, in the Century Bible, and recent volumes of the Cambridge Bible, as well as those in the two German series edited by Nowack and Marti respectively. The second
edition of Driver's Notes 011 the Hebrew Tert of Samuel (1913), which
contains many notes on the topography of these books, appeared just in
time for him to be able to make use of it. It is impossible for him to
specify his obligations to each of these authorities in detail; but in the more important cases references will be found in the Index. It must be remembered that, in the case of places of which the ancient name has not been unmistakeably perpetuated, or about which reliable statements in Eusebius' Onomasticon, or in other ancient authors, fail us, we are confined to conjecture and inference in determining the site. Some
times the site may be inferred with more or less probability from indications in the Old Testament itself; Gibe'ah is a notable instance of this; but modern explorers who have had no philological training often make the mistake of identifying a place mentioned in the Old Testament with one bearing now an Arabic name resembling superficially the ancient Hebrew name,• although in reality there is no connection between them (cf. Abel-Mel)olah in Index). A good many of the identifications to be found in the maps or publications of the Palestine Exploration Fund, and reproduced from them in other English maps, are of this character.
