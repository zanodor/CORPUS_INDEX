It is now well known that the constellations of the Zodiac originated in the ancient land of Babylonia (modern day Iraq). Yet, despite more than a century and a half of scholarship, very little information on this subject has been made accessible to the nonspecialist. We are very grateful to Gavin White for allowing us to reproduce excerpts of his recently published Babylonian Star-lore. Over the forthcoming months these articles will help to address this deficiency by presenting the lore and symbolism of the twelve Babylonian Zodiac constellations.
The excerpts reproduced on this site are taken, with the author's permission, from the recently published book 'Babylonian Star-lore' by Gavin White.
THE SPRING EQUINOX PERIOD (Pages 27-9)
By the time of the spring equinox, light has triumphed over darkness as the days now start to outlast the nights and as such it is a time when new life is celebrated and any lingering influences of the winter are banished. In the fields and cattle-folds, the spring is celebrated as the time of nature’s abundance when a majority of animals bear their young, the harvest is brought in and all nature springs into life. The new moon closest to the spring equinox marks the start of the calendrical New Year. And befitting this sacred juncture it is the season most closely associated with the king, who is now inaugurated and empowered by the gods to rule for another term.
Contrary to its name, the Hired Man was represented in the heavens by the familiar ram or lamb of Aries. As a seasonal symbol the lamb reflects the fact that a majority of newborn lambs, kids and calves appear in the cattle-fold in the springtime. On the other hand, the name of the Hired Man refers to the hired labour used to bring in the springtime barley harvest. The lore of the constellation has been purposefully contrived to reflect the concerns of both barley farmers and cattle-herders. The symbolic meaning of the lamb is best preserved in Greek tradition where it appears as the horned lamb with a golden fleece, possession of which conferred kingship. Its radiant fleece clearly points to the solar nature of the lamb, which like the similar symbols of the bull-calf and goat-kid represents the newborn sun springing into manifestation.
The constellations rising around the time of the spring equinox

The constellation of the Crook depicts a shepherd tending his flocks. Beyond the obvious pastoral symbolism of the herders, the shepherd also functions as one of the primary symbols of the king, who guides his people and nation as a shepherd guides his flocks. As a symbol, the shepherd’s crook naturally represents the king’s regalia and his divinely ordained power to rule. It is therefore fitting that the celestial Crook rises in the first month of the year when the king was inaugurated and empowered by the gods. The figure of the shepherd-king is naturally associated with Dumuzi, who is now grown to be a young man and is about to marry the goddess in the rite of the Sacred Marriage. By this union the king, who was identified with Dumuzi, established his right to rule and further guaranteed the fertility of his realm. The Bull of Heaven is probably the oldest exemplar of the theme of the shepherd and his flocks, which is so strongly represented in the springtime skies. As a basic celestial symbol cattle seem to represent all the fertile powers of the springtime skies – world mythology frequently relates the images of bulls, cows and calves to a whole range of heavenly phenomena including rain-clouds, rays of sunlight and the newborn sun. More specifically, the Sumerian Bull of Heaven is described as a destructive beast, which came down from heaven to drink the rivers dry and to parch the land. These seasonal attributes are no doubt derived from the fact that the Bull of Heaven rises late in the 2nd month of the year when the temperature starts to rise and the rains diminish. The final group of springtime constellations have a strong calendrical significance, as they seem to be purposefully located at the juncture of the old and new years. At this time of natural abundance, the earth was thought to ‘open up’ in order to yield her bounty, but to the archaic mind this opening up was accompanied by a host of dangers, chief of which was the potential pollution from the dead who could gain easy access to the upper worlds at this pivotal time. In light of this belief, I would suggest that the Old Man, with his wand and prophylactic head, is banishing the ghosts of the old year and driving them back to the underworld. A similar set of ideas probably informs the lion-headed demons known as Lulal and Latarak. Like many ferocious ‘demonic’ beings, their influence could be utilised to exorcise any type of evil or malignant force. In the main body of the book I suggest that they act as guardians of the year – banishing any lingering influence of the closing year and purifying the start of the new calendrical cycle.
THE HIRED MAN (Pages 127-131) It is well known that the stars of Aries were referred to as the Hired Man in Babylonian tradition. In the past, this has led many researchers to conclude that these stars must be envisioned as some sort of farm labourer and that the ram figure of Aries was introduced into the zodiac from sources outside Mesopotamia. But contrary to expectations the ‘Hired Man’ is, in fact, the Babylonian name for the ram of Aries. To understand this conundrum, his name has got to be considered in two distinct manners. At face value, the Hired Man represents the ‘hireling’, an agricultural worker employed to bring in the springtime barley harvest. But with a little scholarly latitude, the name can also be understood as the ‘sheep of appeasement’. The two-fold significance of the Hired Man relies on the identity of man and sheep, which is neatly expressed in the cuneiform writing system where the two different signs used to write ‘man’ and ‘sheep’, can both be pronounced as “lu”. This pun appears to be entirely purposeful, as it expresses the dual nature of the constellation – to signify

the barley harvester and the first-born lamb of spring (a similar duality of farming and herding symbolism is also found in the lore surrounding the Bull of Heaven).
The newborn lamb, like the goat-kid and calf, symbolises the rebirth of life that occurs in the spring. More specifically, it makes an analogy between the emergence of the lamb from the waters of the ewe’s womb and the springtime rebirth of the sun from the cosmic waters of the wintertime skies.
In Sumerian the Hired Man is written ‘Mul Lu-Hun-ga’
MUL LU2 HUN GA2 Taken together these signs are read in Akkadian as agru – the ‘hired man or hireling’. The Lu-sign is a stylised figure of a man; it is commonly used before a person’s name to convey the idea of a ‘profession’. In this sense it signifies a ‘freeman or professional’ as opposed to a bondman. The Sumerian compound Hun-ga can be read in Akkadian as agāru – ‘to hire or rent’ something or someone. So the name as a whole can be translated as the ‘Hired Man’. But as the spoken word “lu” can also signify a sheep, and the Hunga compound can be used to write the Akkadian verbs – ‘to rest or be still’, ‘to appease or placate’, and ‘to lift or carry away’ – the name can also be interpreted as something like ‘the sheep of appeasement or placation’.
That the Hired Man was imagined as a ram is made explicit in a handful of later texts where his name is simply written as ‘the Ram’:
In some late texts Aries is known as the Ram, written ‘Mul Udu-Nita’
MUL UDU NITA2 Sheep in general and rams in particular are called immeru in Akkadian. The Udu-sign represents a sheep even if the sign itself bears no obvious relationship to a sheep. This sign occurs in the planetary name ‘the wild sheep’ (Udu-Idim), which specifically refers to the planets Mars, Saturn and Mercury. Its use in astronomic lore is almost certainly due to the symbolism of the quartered circle, which, among other things, can be thought of as an image of the year divided by the solstices and equinoxes. The sign can also be read as “lu”, as for example in Lu-lim, the Stag. Originally the Nita-sign depicted a phallus – its basic meaning is ‘male, virile or manly’.
Although Aries is famous in modern astrology for being the first sign of the zodiac, it does not hold this position in mainstream Babylonian tradition. On the contrary, the ‘leader of the celestial hosts’ in Babylonian star-lore is consistently regarded as the Star Cluster, our Pleiades. In star-lists from the Old Babylonian period to the ‘Stars on the path of the Moon’ found in Mul-Apin, the Star Cluster is placed at the head of the list while the Hired Man is more often than not relegated to the

final position. Inevitably the question arises – when did the Hired Man become the lead star of heaven? The earliest conclusive textual evidence is found in Mul-Apin where the Hired Man is said to
rise on the 1st day of the 1st month. Although Mul-Apin is thought to have been composed between 1200 and 1000 BCE, the earliest copy only dates to 687 BCE, and any section could easily have been updated prior to this terminal point. So at best this reference only proves that the Hired Man
had assumed the role of ‘lead star of heaven’ by the 7th century BCE. To explore the possibility of an earlier date we need to examine the pictorial evidence found on entitlement stones.
Around the 12th century BCE, depictions of a sitting or running ram make their first appearance on entitlement stones. The most interesting example occurs on a stone dated to the 12th century, on which a ram is placed before a shrine topped with a symbol shaped like the flights of an arrow (left). This symbol doesn’t occur on any other published depictions of entitlement stones but on graphic grounds alone, it bears a telling resemblance to the cuneiform sign known as Amar (right), which depicts the face of a calf, but can be used to signify the young offspring of other animals. I believe that it may be a prototype for the modern glyph of Aries, which of course represents the face of the ram. The earliest evidence for the celestial ram can be found shortly after 1600 BCE when the first depictions of the Ram-headed staff appear on entitlement stones. That it is a symbol of some importance is confirmed by its appearance in groups of standards representing the high-ranking gods of astrology (fig 78). This symbol, probably called the mum-symbol, is later commonly combined with the Goatfish (see fig 69) and the turtle – the three symbols are therefore very likely to represent Aries, Capricorn and Cancer, which is astronomically significant as these three constellations respectively mark the spring equinox and the two solstices. Taken as a whole the pictorial evidence from entitlement stones shows that the ram and ram-headed staff were regarded as highranking symbols from approximately 1600 BCE (which is roughly the date that entitlement stones first appear in the archaeological record). These early depictions certainly suggest that the ram had taken its place as the
lead star of heaven by the middle of the 2nd millennium. Unfortunately it isn’t possible to trace the history of the celestial ram any further than this point as the archaeological and literate sources fall silent. Elsewhere I have suggested that the Hired Man assumed its role as herald of the spring
equinox and the New Year in the mid 3rd millennium (see the Crook).
The regent of the Hired Man is the shepherding god Dumuzi – ‘the true child’ or ‘rightful son’. He is one of the earliest and most popular gods known in Mesopotamia, where he is thought of as the ‘spirit of life’ that is manifest in all aspects of nature. He appears in numerous guises, as a god of shepherds, cattle-herders, farmers, orchard men, fishermen and fowlers. Among the shepherds he promotes the abundance of the cattle-fold and its dairy produce, and in this aspect his mother is said to be Duttur, the personified ewe. The myths surrounding Dumuzi largely concern his springtime courtship with Inanna, which culminated in the ceremony of the Sacred Marriage. In this rite, the deified king who was identified with Dumuzi either married the goddess or a priestess representing her. The fertility and fecundity of all nature was promoted by this sacred act of union. Although the last deified king died in the

17th century BCE, the practice may well have continued in a modified form as a marriage between Marduk and Şarpanitu was celebrated as part of the New Year festivities in latter day Babylon. Even though Dumuzi represents the spirit of life, it is his fate to die. As summer grips the land, the rains cease, vegetation dies back and the abundance of springtime wanes. Dumuzi has foreboding dreams of his impending death and asks all nature to mourn for him. Although he tries to escape his fate, calling upon the sun god to save him, such efforts are ultimately futile, as he is ‘doomed to death’. At the height of summer the demons of the underworld search him out, bind him and carry him off to the land of the dead. Some variants of the myth describe how he escaped the demons by diving into a river, but even this ruse failed as the river carried him down to the underworld. But the spirit of life is irrepressible and will ultimately triumph over death. Like the sun god, his patron and protector, Dumuzi returns to the land of the living with the turning of the year. In the form of Damu, ‘the Child’, he escapes from the underworld and the whole cycle starts all over again (see the Swine). Other astrology texts attribute the Hired Man to a primeval god called Kingu. Like Dumuzi, he can be understood as another dying god, whose death ultimately brings life. Kingu appears in the Epic of Creation, where he is the battle-leader of the monstrous hosts that fought against the gods. After the gods attained victory, they executed Kingu, and created mankind from his collected blood. In astrology, the appearance of the Hired Man is used to predict the fate of the kings of the Four regions: ‘If the Hired Man is faint: the king of Subartu will see misery’. Similarly ‘if the Hired Man is black: the king of the Westland (Amurru) will fall in battle’. Both these omens are considered to be auspicious to the Akkadian king as they heaped woe upon his enemies. The Hired Man’s association to kings is probably based on the fact that his star rises in month 1, which is closely associated with the rites of kingship. Surprisingly these two omens are the only examples to mention the Hired Man directly, but like many other ecliptic constellations his star can be called by a number of other names. The commonest of these alternative names is the ‘Field-constellation’, which properly speaking refers to the four stars that make up the Square of Pegasus. The underlying identity between the two constellations is founded on the common theme of barley cultivation (for the same reason ‘the Field’ can also be used to refer to the constellation of the Furrow, our Virgo). The identification of the Field with the Hired Man is made explicit in the State Archives: ‘If the moon is surrounded by a halo and the Field, behind which is the Star Cluster, stands in it: the cattle of the land will prosper’ – the Field, behind which is the Star Cluster is the Hired Man. A quick look at the star map shows that the Hired Man rather than the Field is adjacent to the Star Cluster. The prediction concerning cattle is, of course, very appropriate to the ram’s image applied to the Hired Man. This identification throws considerable light on the Astrolabes where the ‘Field star’ is said to rise in the first month of the year, which is true for the Hired Man but not for the constellation of the Field (ie the Square of Pegasus) that actually rises at the beginning of month 11, some 55 days earlier. Similarly, the description of the ‘Field’ found in the earliest versions of the Astrolabes is also more suited to the Hired Man: ‘The Field that stands at the rising of the east wind, it lies across the south wind. This star is the star of the New Year, the lead star of the stars of Ea. For taking a wife’. The identification is now certain, as the Hired Man can indeed, be utilised in magical practice ‘to get a wife, to arrange a marriage’ – no doubt in memory of the Sacred Marriage celebrated between Dumuzi and Inanna in the springtime. But this isn’t the end of the matter, as the Hired Man can also be identified with the Crookstar, which was envisioned in the heavens as a goat-kid tended by a shepherd. In the section on the Crook I argue that this goat-kid is really a ‘pre-Arian’ version of the ram that was probably the ‘lead star of heaven’ in the late 3rd millennium. This convention of using alternative names goes some way to explain why so little lore concerning the Hired Man is apparent in Babylonian astrology.

THE BULL OF HEAVEN (Pages 64-70)
The wild bull, which had roamed the plains of central
Mesopotamia since time immemorial, was a massive
creature standing over six feet tall at the shoulder. In
literature and the visual arts, it was venerated as a symbol of
supernatural strength and ferocity, often being likened to
gods, kings and heroes. Its broad curving horns inspired the
horned headdress that all gods and goddesses wore to
signify their divine status.
Cattle were first domesticated in the fertile valleys of
Mesopotamia round about 7000 BCE. The overriding motive
for their domestication was not for their meat but for their
great strength, which was harnessed by early farmers to
provide traction for ploughs and threshing sledges. Most
households would only keep one or two beasts, which were
often named and almost treated as part of the family. Large

herds were much rarer only being kept by the palace and temple, whose financial and logistic
resources were capable of supporting them. Milk, their most valuable by-product, was turned into
cheese, butter and ghee. In the artwork of the 4th and 5th millennium the bull is often combined with
an ear of barley – together they symbolise the wealth and bounty of the land brought about by the
Neolithic farming revolution.
The age-old meaning of the bull as a symbol of prosperity and abundant herds is conveyed in
a pair of contrasting omens: ‘If the Bull of Heaven's stars are very bright: the offspring of cattle will
thrive’, but if its stars are very faint: ‘the wealth of the land will disappear; the offspring of cattle and
sheep will not thrive’. These omens expose part of the simplest encoding scheme that underpins celestial divination – if a star or constellation is ‘bright’ its meaning is positive, but if it is ‘faint’ or
‘obscure’ the prediction is negative.
Beyond their nature as symbols of the land’s prosperity, the bull, cow and calf all have a
decidedly celestial quality to their character. Sumerian poetry sometimes refers to rain-laden
clouds as the ‘bull-calves of the storm god’ and other texts attribute huge herds of cattle to the
moon god, their numbers – well over half a million individual beasts – are so implausibly large that
many modern commentators have suggested that they represent the stars of the sky.
Very similar ideas about celestial cattle can be found in early mythology the world over. The
Egyptians personified the heavens as the goddess Hathor, who was often envisioned as a star
spangled cow with the solar disk set between her horns. The falcon-headed god Horus would enter
her mouth each evening to re-emerge as the sun the next day. Comparable ideas can also be
found in Vedic literature where herds of cows represent the fertile rains of the heavens and the
rays of sunlight released at dawn. In this symbolic scheme the golden calf naturally represents the
newborn sun of spring emerging from the cosmic waters just as the newborn calf emerges from the
life-giving waters of the womb. Essentially the calf is a symbol of the reborn sun and of the
resurgent life that follows in his train. Just such an idea can be found in Mesopotamian tradition
where Šamaš, the sun god, is sometimes called the ‘calf of the wild cow’.
The Bull of Heaven is written as ‘Mul Gu-An-na’
MUL GU4 AN NA
In Akkadian these signs are read together as alû – ‘the bull of heaven’, which occurs in mythic, magical and astrological texts.
The Gu-sign depicts the head of a bull. Like many signs that signify
animals, it only illustrates the most characteristic part of the beast as an
abbreviation for the whole animal. Essentially the same symbol lives on
in the form of the modern astrological sigil for Taurus.
The Sumerian term Anna means ‘of heaven’. The An-sign, which depicts a star, has three distinct meanings – ‘heaven’, ‘god’ in general
and the sky god ‘Anu’ in particular.
The final Na-sign functions as a grammatical element, here signifying
the possessive case – so the whole name can be read either as the ‘Bull
of Heaven’ or the ‘Bull of Anu’.
During the course of the 4th millennium the symbol of the bull became associated with a
range of deities, and it is from this period that the very earliest evidence for the existence of
constellations can be found. A fascinating cylinder seal from the Uruk period (fig 20), only manufactured a few centuries after the invention of writing, is decorated with a scene that can
effectively be read as script. On the right-hand side, the Bull of Heaven appears with a series of
three stars placed above it, this being a variant form of the Mul-sign that signifies a ‘star, planet or constellation’. The group of signs on the left-hand side can be read as ‘the goddess Inanna of
sunrise and sunset’. Inanna herself is represented by her sacred reed column that stands in front
of the bull, and her status as a deity is marked by the eight-pointed star. The signs used to
represent ‘sunrise’ and ‘sunset’ are an upright and inverted image of the sun rising between a pair

of mountains. As an attribute of Inanna, they identify her with the planet Venus, which is only seen
as the Morning and Evening star. So this seal not only furnishes us with the
earliest evidence of a constellation in
Mesopotamia but also represents the first
definitive association of a planetary deity with a
constellation.
The circle placed before the bull and
duplicated on its forehead is most likely to be a
solar disk. Several pieces of evidence confirm an
association between the bull and the sun. One of
the principle references occurs in the Standard
version of the Gilgamesh Epic – after the heroes
have slain the Bull of Heaven ‘they bore its heart
aloft and offered it to the sun god Šamaš’. In
omen literature the solar association appears
among the lore of Venus: ‘If Venus stands in the
Sun’s crown’ – she comes close to the Bull’s Jaw (The
equation is probably based on the fact that the Bull’s Jaw is
also known as the Crown of Anu.) The solar attribution is still
present in the latest texts – a 1st millennium text that combines
astrology and liver divination attributes the sun god to the
second month of the year and the Bull of Heaven.
The idea of the sky-bull can be found on artefacts
distributed throughout the Ancient Near East. On one such
object, a pedestal stone from Teima (fig 21), a true assemblage
of celestial symbols drawn from neighbouring cultures can be
seen. In the centre of the stone, the principle object of
veneration is the bull’s head surmounted with a solar disk. Its
appearance is very reminiscent of Egyptian portrayals of the
Apis bull. While arrayed around it is a group of astral symbols
a winged disk, lunar crescent and star of Venus – all of which
are clearly drawn from a Babylonian milieu.
In Babylonian tradition, the nature of the celestial bull is best seen in the Sumerian poem
entitled ‘Hero in Battle’, which forms part of the earliest Gilgamesh cycle. In the poem, Inanna
demands the Bull of Heaven from her father Anu so that she can wreck her vengeance on
Gilgamesh who has rejected her love. Although Anu isn’t happy to hand over the bull, saying that it
would have no food on the earth as ‘its pasture is on the horizon’, and ‘it can only graze where the
sun rises’, he finally concedes to his daughter’s demands when she flies into a rage. Inanna took
hold of the bull’s halter and led it down to
earth, where it ravished Gilgamesh’s city, Uruk.
In its insatiable hunger it devoured the
pastures and palm groves, and drank the rivers
dry. Gilgamesh’s minstrel interrupted his lord
while feasting and informed him of the
destruction wrought by the bull. After calmly
finishing their beer, Gilgamesh and his heroic
companion, Enkidu, armed themselves and
went out to fight the bull. After sizing up their
adversary, Enkidu seized its tail and
Gilgamesh dispatched it with a blow from his
axe. The bull’s carcase was subsequently
butchered; its meat was distributed among the
orphans of the city, its hide sent to the tanners

while its horns were made into flasks for pouring oil to Inanna in her temple.
A strange episode occurs at the end of the story. After Gilgamesh and Enkidu had killed the
Bull of Heaven, one of the heroes cut off the bull’s haunch and threw it at Inanna. In response to
this apparent insult, Inanna assembled her courtesans and performed rites of mourning over the
bull’s haunch.
There is an intriguing parallel to this puzzling incident in
Egyptian mortuary traditions where a bull’s foreleg is one of the
chief offerings made to the deceased (right). And it can be no coincidence that the Egyptians placed their constellation of the
Bull’s Foreleg among the stars of Ursa Major – which the Babylonians envisioned as their funerary Wagon.
Like so many myths there is more to this story than is
immediately apparent. When we take an overview of the whole
story we can see that a number of mythic and ritual features
have undergone some quite radical reformulations.
Certain incidents in the myth presuppose a change in the
relationship between the king and the goddess. In the older
kingship rituals, Inanna married the king in the Sacred Marriage
ceremony and thereby conferred all her powers upon the king.
But Gilgamesh now refuses Inanna’s love and transfers his
allegiance to Šamaš, the sun god. Furthermore, by the time that
the Menologies were written the kingship rites, where the king is empowered and installed in office,
are patronised by Enlil and Anu, rather than Inanna. There is also reason to think that the
fundamental nature of the bull-sacrifice has also changed from the solemn offering of a complete
bull to Inanna, to a joyful communal feast where only a small part of the sacrifice (the haunch) is
offered to the deity.
Above and beyond these ritual changes, we must also suspect that the very nature of the bull
has changed from a ‘Golden Calf’, symbolising the birth season of lambs, kids and calves, to the
raging ‘Bull of Heaven’ found in the Sumerian story. Such a transformation could only come about
through the long-term effects of precession which has progressively moved the bull’s rising date
from close to the spring equinox into the 2nd month of the year, which is when the rains start to
diminish at the onset of the dry season. This finally explains the Bull’s attributes in the myth where
he destroys the pastures and drinks the rivers dry.
Even though the Golden Calf of spring was transformed into the raging Bull of early summer,
its symbolism lived on in newly created constellations. Set further to the west where they correctly
rise around the time of the spring equinox, the constellations of the Crook and the Hired Man were
represented on the star-map by a shepherd tending a goat-kid and a running lamb respectively.
The bull’s shifting position among the stars
may well inform a distinct art motif found on a
number of late 3rd millennium seals. It is generally
called the ‘bull and winged gate’ by modern
scholars, if indeed, a gate is actually depicted. The
motif is of unknown significance, but the common
appearance of a star above the bull’s head certainly
suggests that an astral theme is alluded to.
The format of the images varies somewhat
the bull can crouch before the figure of a god or
goddess, who sometimes holds a tether fastened to
the bull’s nose-ring, while in other images an
attendant may hold the tether, which is either
attached to the winged gate or held by the deity.
Given that the symbol of the tethering rope or celestial bond is often applied to the solstices and
equinoxes we might have in these images a visual record of Taurus’ shift away from the spring equinox.

Unfortunately, the motif goes out of fashion for many centuries
and only reappears in the latest astrological art, where it is seen on a
seal from Uruk (fig 25). At the very least, this seal demonstrates that
the ‘gate’ was associated with Taurus in the minds of 1st millennium astrologers, but at present nothing further can be added.
One of the most confusing aspects of the celestial bull is its
portrayal as a constellation image. Our modern image of Taurus can be traced back to the Greek model, which is invariably represented by
a hump-backed bull
(right) – or rather, the front half of a hump-backed bull
as the figure is entirely missing its hindquarters.
This curtailed image was certainly known in
Babylonia in the latter half of the 1st millennium, as
the Astronomic Diaries mention a star called ‘the beginning of the bull’, which only makes sense in the
context of this half-figure. (Similarly, Ptolemy refers to
a ‘line of stars where (Taurus) is cut-off’ in his
Tetrabiblos of the 2nd century CE). The only certain image of the celestial bull, to
survive from Babylonia itself, can be found on the
famous set of tablets from Uruk (fig 27). But fate has played a cruel trick, in so far as the crucial area of the
tablet, which
contained the Bull’s hindquarters, has been totally destroyed.
So much so, that we simply can’t tell whether the bull was
originally figured as a complete beast or was missing its
hindquarters.
At first sight the general orientation of the Uruk Bull
appears quite consistent with the Greek image except for a
slight reorientation of its head. However, the other
constellation images from this set of tablets are all reversed
left to right, reflecting their origin as images drawn from a
celestial sphere, and when this is factored in, the image is no
longer compatible with the Greek figure.
This is indeed, most peculiar, not least because it
directly contradicts the only safe assumptions that can be made concerning the orientation of the
bull on the celestial sphere. These are that its head corresponds to the distinct ‘V’-shaped group of
stars known as the Hyades, and that its shoulder corresponds to the compact cluster of stars
known as the Pleiades. So we face the seemingly absurd possibility that the figure of the Bull was purposefully reversed in astronomic illustrations. On grounds of common sense, this idea would
have to be dismissed outright were it not for the Dendera Zodiac, which portrays the Bull in exactly
this fashion.

By comparing figures 28 and 29 we can see that the Circular Zodiac at Dendera has, like the
Babylonian model, reversed the image of Taurus from left to right and has furthermore, done
exactly the same to Aries. To my knowledge this anomaly hasn’t been commented on before. Even
though earlier Egyptian images of the constellations are notoriously badly orientated, I don’t
believe that this is a simple error but is, on the contrary, a purposeful clue that points to some
significant end. Although it is outside the remit of the present book to go into this subject in any
detail, I would suggest that the designer of the Circular Zodiac is trying to reformulate the star-map
for the Piscean Age. By shifting the position of the Star Cluster into the region of Pisces the
designer has restored the traditional placement of the moon at the beginning of the year. (Compare
figures 164 and 165)
By way of a summary, I believe that the Bull of Heaven was originally depicted on the star
map as a bull-calf, which symbolised the spring equinox way back in the 5th millennium. Many
centuries later, in the mid to late 3rd millennium, the golden calf was transformed into a full-grown
bull, whose fiery nature symbolised the onset of the hot season. It was now represented in the
skies by the half-figure of the bull that was eventually transmitted to the Greek star-map – the
episode in the Gilgamesh cycle concerning the removal of the bull’s haunch can certainly be cited
in support of this idea. The Bull was probably cut in half to accommodate newly created
constellations to its west, such as the Hired Man and Lulal and Latarak, which would now mark the
New Year. The occurrence of complete bull figures, in astrological art such as the Dendera
Zodiacs, could best be explained as symbols representing the bull, rather than as accurate
constellation images.

It is now well known that the constellations of the Zodiac originated in the ancient land of Babylonia (modern day Iraq). Yet, despite more than a century and a half of
scholarship, very little information on this subject has been made accessible to the nonspecialist. We are very grateful to Gavin White for allowing us to reproduce excerpts of his
recently published Babylonian Star-lore. Over the forthcoming months these articles will help to address this deficiency by presenting the lore and symbolism of the twelve
Babylonian Zodiac constellations.

THE SUMMER SOLSTICE PERIOD (Pages 29-31)
The next distinct group of symbols is made up from the constellations that rise during the summer. These stars mark the hot dry season, which, unlike the milder climes of Europe, is regarded as the time of death in Mesopotamia. At this time the lands are ravished by drought and plague, and even nature herself becomes barren – the life-giving rains have ceased and river levels decline, the harvest is finished and all vegetation dies back under the scorching summer sun.
As the sun approached the peak of his powers, Dumuzi had foreboding dreams of his own death. His premonitions came true at the summer solstice and his funeral rites were performed amidst wailings and lamentations in month 4, immediately after the solstice. As Dumuzi walked the path of the dead, he took the sorrows of the worlds with him to the land of the shades.
Third Sector – the constellations rising around the summer solstice

Rituals dedicated to the dead also dominated month 5, which fell in late summer. At this time, when the veil between life and death was at its thinnest, the great Brazier festival was celebrated. This festival commemorated the ancestors, who were invited back to the world of the living for an annual feast in their descendant’s homes. The rites involved lighting torches and braziers to guide the departed ghosts of the ancestors back from the darkness of the underworld. The stars rising around the time of the summer solstice are thus fittingly informed by images of death, war and travel between the worlds.
The Serpent is one of the primary
symbols of death and the underworld. Like
its Greek counterpart, the Hydra, the Babylonian Serpent was set in the heavens
to guard an entrance to the underworld.
This entrance was used by Dumuzi on his
way to the underworld and it would also be
the most logical route used by the ancestral ghosts when they returned to earth for the great
ancestral festival celebrated in late summer. In Babylonian tradition the Serpent was held sacred to
Ningišzida, the ‘Lord of the Underworld’ and when Death itself was envisioned it was thought to
have the face of a serpent. The malign nature of the Serpent constellation is all too apparent in
astrology omens where its appearance predicts famine, plague and pestilence.
It is also possible that the Serpent performs a secondary seasonal role as a symbol of the
summertime drought. The clearest expression of this function can be found in Greek myth where
the Serpent’s counterpart, called the Hydra, is literally known as the ‘water-serpent’. In Greek myth
the Hydra was portrayed constraining the underground waters and thereby causing springs to dry up and river levels to fall.
The Crab was also closely associated with an entrance to the underworld in
Greek and Roman traditions. Much the same is implied in Babylonian traditions
where some magical texts even speak of using the influence of the Crab in rites
designed to raise ghosts from the underworld and to make offerings to the dead. In
the section on the Crab I propose that it has ultimately inherited these otherworldly
traits, as well as its strong associations to rivers, from the older constellation of the
Serpent.
The underworld themes continue in the form of the Great Twins and their
lesser counterparts, the Little Twins, who are all are depicted on the star-map as
fully armed warriors. The Great Twins in particular, are both closely associated
with Nergal, the king of the underworld, and one of them is known to travel back
and forth between the realms of the dead and the upper worlds. The symbolic
function of the Great Twins within the stellar calendar was to guard the
summertime entranceway to the realm of the dead that was located in the region
of the Serpent and Crab.
The theme of travelling between the worlds continues in the lore of the
True Shepherd of Anu and his accompanying animal symbol, the Rooster, who
both represent the herald of the gods. Their divinely ordained role was to
communicate the messages of the gods to the denizens of every realm, which
necessitated their journeying between the worlds. Among the messages they
relayed would have been the decision of the gods concerning the fate of
Dumuzi and the other dying gods who are now making their way towards the
underworld. As ‘the one struck down by a mace’, the True Shepherd has
himself walked the long path of the dead.
The summer solstice itself was represented on the star-map in the form of
a bird seated on a high-perch. The summer solstice not only marked the longest
day of the year but also the time that the sun was at it’s highest in the skies. In
the section on the Arrow, I proposed that the bird seated on a high perch
represented the solar-bird at the highest point of its annual ascent in to the
heavens.

The Lion has a number of inter-related themes woven into its symbolic
nature. As king of the beasts he can naturally represent the king; as a
ferocious predatory beast he can also symbolise war and death – the Lion’s
astrological omens mostly concern the vagaries of war and the occurrence of
natural disasters such as famine; and as a seasonal symbol he represents
the heat of high summer – his radiant mane being a simple metaphor for the
overbearing rays of the summertime sun.
The goddess of war is also portrayed among the summertime stars in
the form of the Bow-constellation. Together with her sacred Lion, she marks
the summer as the season of war, when campaigns commenced in the spring
finally come to fruition. She grants glory and victory to her royal favourites who
are represented in the heavens by the King Star, which stands at the Lion’s
breast.
THE GREAT TWINS (Pages 124-5)
In Babylonia, the zodiac constellation of Gemini was known as the Great Twins, and like their Greek counterparts, the Dioscuri, the Babylonian Twins were depicted as a pair of warriors armed
to the hilt. A Neo-Assyrian text describes their constellation figures as ‘two bearded males’. The
front twin carries a weapon called a hinšu (possibly a type of mace) in his right hand, while the rear twin ‘carries a sickle-axe in his left hand’.
The war-like nature of the Great Twins is vividly portrayed
throughout the corpus of celestial omens: ‘If Venus stands
between the Great Twins: the land will become altogether hostile’. ‘If the Strange Star (Mars) approaches the Twins: the prince will die and hostilities will arise’.
The Twins were envisioned, weapons at the ready,
guarding one of the entrances to the underworld. In Babylonian
tradition, there are actually two entrances to the underworld,
each of which is associated with one of the solstices. The
wintertime entrance is primarily used by discarnate souls
journeying to the afterlife, but the summer entrance, located in
the region of the Crab, is used by the spirits of the ancestors
when they return to earth to visit their family homes for the great
ancestral festival celebrated in month 5. The summertime
entrance is also the route that the souls of newborn babies use to
enter into the world of men. The Twins probably guard this
entrance to prevent the ingress of evil demons, which are
sometimes said to use this otherworldly portal to bring plague
and disease to mankind.
The name of the Great Twins is written ‘Mul Maš-tab-ba-gal-gal’
MUL MAŠ TAB BA GAL GAL The Great Twins are known as tū’amū rabûtu in Akkadian. The Sumerian
word Maš, meaning ‘twin or companion’ has also entered Akkadian as māšū. In Sumerian ‘twin’ can be conveyed by the Maš-sign alone, but more often
‘twin’ is written in a longer form as Maštabba. As an independent sign Tab signifies a ‘companion or partner’, so the idea of the ‘twins’ can be more literally
translated as ‘the two companions’.
It is not known what the Gal-sign actually depicts – suggestions include a crown or headdress of some sort. The sign is commonly used to mean ‘great or
big’. In the cuneiform writing system the final adjective (Gal) is often doubled to indicate plurality.

Twins

Even though the Twins are gods in their own right, they are both commonly identified with
Nergal, the Lord of the Underworld, who brings death to man through the combined agencies of
war, famine and plague. Indeed, the names of the Great Twins simply reveal two aspects of
Nergal’s character – Lugalirra means the ‘Mighty King’, perhaps a reference to Nergal as king of
the dead, and Meslamtaea is literally ‘the One who has arisen from the Underworld’. The identity of
Nergal and Meslamtaea is visually confirmed on entitlement stones where Meslamtaea can be
represented by the double-headed lion staff, which is usually regarded as one of Nergal’s primary
symbols (see fig 104). The close affinity of the Twins to Nergal is concisely stated in astrology
texts: ‘If the Twins rise: devouring by the disease god Nergal’.
Befitting their associations to the disease-bringing Nergal, the Great Twins are mentioned in
medical texts as a cause of disease. There are specific illnesses called ‘Seizure by Lugalirra’
possibly a form of epilepsy, and ‘Covering by the Twins’ associated with the winds and flies. A
fragmentary omen that involves the Twins predicts that ‘in Akkad, Enlil will cause leprosy and
epilepsy, and Nergal will devour the cattle’.
Later texts elaborate upon the underworld theme where they identify Lugalirra and
Meslamtaea with the Moon god and Gilgamesh. These identifications probably rely on the facts
that the Moon god was born in the underworld, and that Gilgamesh, after his death, became one of
the judges of the dead.
The Greek myths associated with Gemini help to throw some light on the basic nature of the Babylonian Twins. One of the Greek warrior twins was mortal (Castor who was sired by a mortal
father) and the other immortal (Polydeuces who was fathered by Zeus). The mortal twin was killed
by a rival and was immediately avenged by his immortal brother. But their mutual love for each
other forbade one of them to outlive the other – so Zeus solved their dilemma by allowing the twins
to spend their time alternately in the heavens and the underworld. Their endless roaming between
the upper and lower worlds clearly parallels the annual journeying of Nergal who annually
descends to the underworld after mid-summer and re-emerges again before mid-winter. In light of
this, we can see that Meslamtaea’s name – ‘the One who has arisen from the Underworld’ – is, in
fact, another attribute of Nergal.

THE CRAB (Pages 79-82) The Crab is described in a 1st millennium astrology text as having a number of stars on its sides, and containing within its centre a group of stars that are ‘pressed together’ – these stars are none other than the open cluster known in Greek star-lore as the Manger or Beehive. Like the Greek figure of Cancer, its latter-day namesake, the Babylonian Crab is set astride the ecliptic with its claws pointing towards the Lion. Strangely enough there are no known depictions of a crab on any entitlement stones, a circumstance that has led some commentators to suggest that it may be represented on these monuments by the figure of a turtle. This is, in fact, very plausible as the Crab’s name can be written as Kušu, a ‘water creature’, which according to the lexicon can refer to a crab as well as a snapping turtle. The turtle gives every impression of being an important symbol on entitlement stones. It commonly occurs as an individual symbol, and is occasionally combined with the Goatfish. These two symbols, as well as the Ram-headed staff, which is also commonly found in combination with the Goatfish (see fig 69), are all attributed to the wise god Enki. As the Goatfish and Ramheaded staff undoubtedly represent Capricorn and Aries, it is therefore very likely that the turtle represents Cancer – the three symbols then have an added significance in that they each mark one of the equinoxes or solstices. In the era when Mul-Apin was composed the Crab occupied the most northerly section of the ecliptic, where the sun, moon, and planets reached their most northerly positions. This fact probably informs its description in Mul-Apin where the constellation is called the ‘seat of Anu’. The god Anu, who is literally the god of ‘heaven’, rules the highest and most remote of the three superimposed heavens found in Babylonian cosmology, it is thus fitting that he should rule the highest sector of the ecliptic. Perhaps for the same reason the special station of Jupiter, the ‘king of the planets’, is traditionally stationed between the Lion and the Crab, an association that has survived into modern times where his astrological exaltation is located in Cancer. As a creature of the waters, the Crab is used in astrological omens to predict the coming floods. The fundamentals of the scheme are expressed in binary form: ‘If the stars of the Crab scintillate: high floods will come’. ‘If the stars of the Crab are faint: high floods will not come’.
This basic scheme is developed further in the Great Star List where the front stars of the Crab specifically represent the waters of the Tigris, and its rear stars are used to foretell the water levels of the Euphrates. The association of the Crab with rivers is so strong that the following omen is understood to refer to the Crab even though it isn’t explicitly mentioned: ‘If the moon is surrounded by a river:

there will be great floods and cloudbursts’ – the Crab stands in the halo of the moon. Reflecting the same symbolism, late astrology texts sometimes refer to the Crab simply as ‘the Waters’ (A-meš).
In astrology texts the Crab is usually written ‘Mul Al-lul’
MUL AL LUL The Sumerian term has been borrowed into Akkadian as alluttu – a ‘crab’. The plural form of the Akkadian name may have been used to designate ‘tongs or pincers’. Although one source suggests that the Crab’s name means ‘the deceptive digger’, it is, in truth, impossible to be certain. Its component elements are as follows: The Al-sign depicts a hoe or pickaxe, perhaps alluding to the crab’s claws as digging implements, or to the turtle’s spade-like flippers The Lul-sign depicts a fox; it has a variety of meanings as an individual sign including ‘false, deceptive, criminal and rebellious’. It is the primary element in the name of the Fox-star and the False Star, both of which are commonly used to refer to Mars. The Crab is actually identified with the False Star in the astrological dictum: ‘the False Star is the Crab’. This aphorism illustrates one of the esoteric methods employed by astrologers to derive identifications between one stellar body and another. The common identity of the False Star and the Crab can only be understood in terms of the cuneiform writing system where the False Star is written Lul-la – when this name is read backwards the Sumerian name of the Crab, Al-lul, is revealed. There are two alternative ways of writing the Crab’s name that could throw some light on its perceived meaning – A-meš, which simply means ‘the waters’, and A-lu, which can be understood as ‘abundant water’. Given these forms, which place a significant stress on the idea of water, and what we know of the esoteric methods used by scribes, we could speculate that ancient astrologers could have reinterpreted the Crab’s name as A-lul, which would mean something like ‘the deceptive waters’ – in reference to it withholding the waters of heaven during the summer dry season. In later texts the name of the Crab can also be written with the Nagar-sign (left). This sign signifies a carpenter or craftsman, which suggests that it has been selected to illustrate the analogy between the crab’s claws and a carpenters saw.
In Greek star-lore, the origins of the Crab as a celestial figure can be found among the Labours of Hercules. For his second Labour, Hercules is set the task of defeating the monstrous Hydra, a multiple-headed serpent that was terrorising the swamplands around the town of Lerna. At the height of the combat a gigantic crab emerged from the swamp to distract the hero by nipping his foot – but to no avail, as Heracles simply crushed the hapless creature underfoot. After his victory the goddess Hera reverently placed the crab into the heavens as Cancer. It has often been thought that this episode involving the crab was inserted into the Labours by an over zealous astrologer with the aim of assimilating the 12 Labours to the 12 signs of the zodiac. However, the various elements of this myth can all be found to have striking parallels in the mythology of the Mesopotamian god Ninurta. His exploits against a series of fantastic monsters called the Slain Heroes are now widely thought to provide the inspiration for Hercules’ Labours. Listed among the monsters which Ninurta defeated is a seven-headed dragon, which is an obvious prototype for the Greek Hydra; the illustration (fig 40) dating to the Early Dynastic period, shows an unnamed hero severing one of the dragon’s heads. Hercules’ encounter with the crab is directly paralleled by another episode in Ninurta’s mythology where he battles with a turtle. The story tells

how Ninurta coveted the powers and symbols of civilised life (called the Me in Sumerian) for his own selfish ends. But Enki, the wise god of the Abyss, divined Ninurta’s selfish intent, and fashioned a turtle to battle with him. The adversaries, locked in mortal combat, fell into a pit where the turtle kept ‘gnawing Ninurta’s feet with his claws’.
Although it is well beyond the scope of this book to make a comparative study of Greek and Mesopotamian myths, one significant theme emerging from this material does deserve to be mentioned – in both sets of myths the crab or turtle is either newly created or newly placed into the stars – in other words the myths detail the actual creation of Cancer as a constellation. As I have argued elsewhere, the creation of many constellations is due in large measure to the long-term effects of precession. This phenomenon slowly causes the stars to rise later and later in the calendar, thus necessitating the periodic creation of new constellations. As I hope to show in the final section, the Crab has actually inherited its principle symbolic traits from the much older figure of the Serpent.
One final aspect of the Crab’s symbolism is worth exploring – it has an unmistakeable association to death, the ancestors and the path to the underworld. These associations are particularly reflected in the magical lore surrounding the Crab, which can be variously utilised to ‘take hold of a ghost and let it associate with living men, to reveal the nature of men’s deaths, and to offer water to a ghost’. Comparable symbolism is prominent in astrological lore where we learn that: ‘If the Strange Star (Mars) comes close to the Crab: the ruler will die’ and that: ‘If the Crab is dark: the ghost of a wronged person (or the spirit of death) will seize the land, there will be deaths in the land’.
Part of this deathly symbolism can be accounted for in calendrical terms as the Crab makes its annual appearance in the course of month 4, when the death rites of Dumuzi are celebrated. In many respects these rites form a prelude to the festival of the ancestors celebrated in month 5, in which the ancestors are temporarily invited back to the upper worlds to commune with the living which would account for much of the magical lore mentioned above. The path that the ancestors follow to the upper worlds is located in the region of the Crab and is remembered in Greek mythology as the entrance to the underworld situated close to the Hydra’s lair. Dionysus used this entrance when he attempted to bring his dead mother back from the realm of shades. And it is also remembered in Roman astrology as the ‘Gates of Men’, which is the route taken by the souls of babies destined to be born on earth. A further reason for associating the Crab with the underworld may be found in its Akkadian name alluttu. Although there is probably no real etymological connection, its name could easily be assimilated to the Semitic underworld goddess known as Allatum, who was later identified with Eriškigal, the great Sumerian queen of the dead. These deathly traits have undoubtedly been transferred to the Crab from the Serpent, who not only has a watery nature (see the Raven) but is also one of the principle symbols of the ancestral realm via its attribution to Ningišzida, the ‘Lord of the Underworld’. Even the rebirth symbolism associated with the Crab is found in the lore of the Serpent – as the bašmu-serpent is literally the ‘serpent with a womb’. To return to Hercules’ Labour, we can now understand the essential action of the myth – the slaying of the Hydra and the creation of the Cancer – as a calendrical reform of the stars, which reflected the ongoing effects of precession. The ancient constellation of the Serpent had slipped back in the calendar to the point at which it no longer rose in its appropriate season and had consequently been ‘killed off’ and replaced by the Crab, which now embodied the symbolic traits previously associated with the Serpent.

THE SUMMER SOLSTICE PERIOD (Pages 29-31)
The next distinct group of symbols is made up from the constellations that rise during the summer. These stars mark the hot dry season, which, unlike the milder climes of Europe, is regarded as the time of death in Mesopotamia. At this time the lands are ravished by drought and plague, and even nature herself becomes barren – the life-giving rains have ceased and river levels decline, the harvest is finished and all vegetation dies back under the scorching summer sun.
As the sun approached the peak of his powers, Dumuzi had foreboding dreams of his own death. His premonitions came true at the summer solstice and his funeral rites were performed amidst wailings and lamentations in month 4, immediately after the solstice. As Dumuzi walked the path of the dead, he took the sorrows of the worlds with him to the land of the shades.
Third Sector – the constellations rising around the summer solstice

Rituals dedicated to the dead also dominated month 5, which fell in late summer. At this time, when the veil between life and death was at its thinnest, the great Brazier festival was celebrated. This festival commemorated the ancestors, who were invited back to the world of the living for an annual feast in their descendant’s homes. The rites involved lighting torches and braziers to guide the departed ghosts of the ancestors back from the darkness of the underworld. The stars rising around the time of the summer solstice are thus fittingly informed by images of death, war and travel between the worlds.
The Serpent is one of the primary symbols of death and the underworld. Like its Greek counterpart, the Hydra, the Babylonian Serpent was set in the heavens to guard an entrance to the underworld. This entrance was used by Dumuzi on his way to the underworld and it would also be the most logical route used by the ancestral ghosts when they returned to earth for the great ancestral festival celebrated in late summer. In Babylonian tradition the Serpent was held sacred to Ningišzida, the ‘Lord of the Underworld’ and when Death itself was envisioned it was thought to have the face of a serpent. The malign nature of the Serpent constellation is all too apparent in astrology omens where its appearance predicts famine, plague and pestilence. It is also possible that the Serpent performs a secondary seasonal role as a symbol of the summertime drought. The clearest expression of this function can be found in Greek myth where the Serpent’s counterpart, called the Hydra, is literally known as the ‘water-serpent’. In Greek myth the Hydra was portrayed constraining the underground waters and thereby causing springs to dry up and river levels to fall. The Crab was also closely associated with an entrance to the underworld in Greek and Roman traditions. Much the same is implied in Babylonian traditions where some magical texts even speak of using the influence of the Crab in rites designed to raise ghosts from the underworld and to make offerings to the dead. In the section on the Crab I propose that it has ultimately inherited these otherworldly traits, as well as its strong associations to rivers, from the older constellation of the Serpent.
The underworld themes continue in the form of the Great Twins and their lesser counterparts, the Little Twins, who are all are depicted on the star-map as fully armed warriors. The Great Twins in particular, are both closely associated with Nergal, the king of the underworld, and one of them is known to travel back and forth between the realms of the dead and the upper worlds. The symbolic function of the Great Twins within the stellar calendar was to guard the summertime entranceway to the realm of the dead that was located in the region
of the Serpent and Crab. The theme of travelling between the worlds continues in the lore of the True Shepherd of Anu and his accompanying animal symbol, the Rooster, who both represent the herald of the gods. Their divinely ordained role was to communicate the messages of the gods to the denizens of every realm, which necessitated their journeying between the worlds. Among the messages they relayed would have been the decision of the gods concerning the fate of Dumuzi and the other dying gods who are now making their way towards the underworld. As ‘the one struck down by a mace’, the True Shepherd has himself walked the long path of the dead. The summer solstice itself was represented on the star-map in the form of a bird seated on a high-perch. The summer solstice not only marked the longest day of the year but also the time that the sun was at it’s highest in the skies. In the section on the Arrow, I proposed that the bird seated on a high perch represented the solar-bird at the highest point of its annual ascent in to the heavens.

The Lion has a number of inter-related themes woven into its symbolic nature. As king of the beasts he can naturally represent the king; as a ferocious predatory beast he can also symbolise war and death – the Lion’s astrological omens mostly concern the vagaries of war and the occurrence of natural disasters such as famine; and as a seasonal symbol he represents the heat of high summer – his radiant mane being a simple metaphor for the overbearing rays of the summertime sun. The goddess of war is also portrayed among the summertime stars in the form of the Bow-constellation. Together with her sacred Lion, she marks the summer as the season of war, when campaigns commenced in the spring finally come to fruition. She grants glory and victory to her royal favourites who are represented in the heavens by the King Star, which stands at the Lion’s breast.
THE LION (Pages 140-1) The zodiac constellation of Leo has its ultimate origins in the ancient Babylonian constellation of the Lion. The only appreciable difference in their respective appearances is that the Great Lion, to give the Babylonian constellation its full name, is normally portrayed with a set of wings, no doubt to emphasise its celestial nature. The Lion’s symbolic character is dominated by three major themes – it is a symbol of high summer, war and carnage, and the king. As a seasonal symbol representing high summer the Lion’s radiant mane represents the full power of the summertime sun. Its scorching rays parch the fields, dry up the rivers and grip the whole land in drought. Relief only comes with the advent of the rainy season in early autumn. As a ferocious carnivore the lion has further come to symbolise war amongst men and carnage amongst the herds. Rampaging packs of lions were a common enough menace throughout Mesopotamia during the Sumerian period. Along with the wolf they were feared as the destroyer of herds: ‘If Mars enters the Lion and stands there: downfall of cattle’; and when huge packs were abroad they even shut down overland trade-routes and turned their fury upon men: ‘If the Lion is dark: for three years lions and wolves will kill people, they will cut off the traffic with the Westland’.
And as ‘king of the beasts’ the lion represents the king and his relationship to the realm. This basic meaning can be traced back to ‘anomaly omens’ whose predictions are derived from the appearances of malformed births and miscarriages. These omens, first committed to writing in the Old Babylonian period, are undoubtedly based on a Sumerian oral tradition, and it is apparent from the examples quoted below that the lion’s regal symbolism was already firmly established in the Mesopotamian imagination long before any astrology texts were committed to writing: ‘If a woman gives birth and the child has a lion’s head: there will be a harsh king in the land’. However, these unfavourable predictions are transformed when the mother in question is of royal blood, then the prediction is positive: ‘If a woman of the palace gives birth and the child has a face of a lion: the king will have no opponent’.
In contrast to the anomaly omens involving the lion, astrological omens tend to make a clearer distinction between the king and the realm – the Lion as a whole seems to represent the realm: ‘If the Lion is black: the land will be discontented’, while the king is represented by the King

Star (our Regulus), which stands at the Lion’s breast: ‘If the King Star is black: the commander of the palace will die’.
In earlier texts the Lion is usually called ‘Mul Ur-mah’ – the ‘Exalted Lion’, but from the middle of the 2nd millennium its name is usually written ‘Mul UrGu-la’
MUL UR GU LA The Sumerian word was borrowed into Akkadian as urgulû. The Ur-sign depicts a lion’s head; it is best translated as ‘large carnivore’ as the sign can also refer to dogs and wolves. The combination Gu-la appears to be an alternative way of writing the Sumerian word Gal, which simply means ‘great or big’.
In astrology texts such as Mul-Apin the regent of the Lion is named as the minor god Latarak. He is a lion-headed being who gives the impression of being a ‘protective figure’ more akin to a demon than a god. He is often twinned with another lion-headed deity called Lulal – together they are depicted as constellation figures in their own right (see the section on Lulal and Latarak). Regardless of its attribution to Latarak, the Lion is especially associated with the war goddess in both literature and art. The war goddess, known as Inanna in Sumerian and Ištar in Akkadian, is sometimes simply known as the ‘Lioness of Heaven’. Mythic texts reveal that her temple throne was supported by a pair of ferocious lions, but more often than not Inanna could be found on the battle-field where the roar of her sacred lion enunciated war – ‘the lion, the dog of Ištar, roared and did not stop roaring’. Inanna’s lust for war and carnage is frequently praised in Sumerian literature. Many of her warlike attributes are recorded in the Sumerian poem ‘Inanna and the mountain of Ebih’, which recounts the goddess’ destruction of a mountain realm that refused to submit to her will. The poem praises her as the ‘lady of battle’, who is ‘clad in terror’ and ‘drenched in blood’. She ‘destroys mighty lands with the arrow and overwhelms the lands with her strength’. ‘In the heavens and upon the earth she roars like a lion and devastates the people’. She proudly proclaims that she was ‘placed at the right hand of the king so that she might destroy the rebel lands’. In astrology, Inanna’s sacred planet is Venus, whose appearance in the Lion naturally enough portends war – her aspect as morning or evening star indicates the theatre of battle: ‘If Venus stands inside the Lion in the east: in Elam there will be a battle’. ‘If in the west: in Akkad there will be a battle’. In fact the association of Venus and the Lion is so close that she is regarded as having her second exaltation or ‘secret place’ in the Lion: ‘If Venus reaches her secret place: good fortune will come to pass’ – She reaches the constellation of the Lion.

THE PRE-AUTUMN EQUINOX PERIOD (Pages 32-3)
The coming of autumn heralds the start of the farming year and the welcome return of the rains. All manner of plants produce their fruits and as they fall to the earth and perish so do they set their seed within the earth. Farmers too, acting in accordance with nature’s cycles, start to sow their newly prepared fields with the coming season’s barley.
The autumnal abundance of the earth is symbolised by the two-fold goddesses of
the Frond and the Furrow, which respectively represent the two principle cultivated
foodstuffs of Babylonia – dates and barley. Dates are especially valuable as they
provide a rich source of nourishment that is easily preserved for future use. The
constellation of the Frond, which depicts the goddess Erua with a branch of the date
palm, makes its annual appearance in the heavens as the dates start to ripen on the
frond.
Fourth Sector – the constellations rising before the autumn equinox

The constellation of the Furrow is the precursor of our modern-day Virgo. The Babylonian figure is represented among the stars as the goddess Šala who
holds the familiar ear of barley in her hands. As a seasonal symbol she represents
the autumn seeding season when farmers use the seed plough to plant seed in
the newly prepared fields.
Over the summer months, fallow land was prepared for the coming growing
season. The fields were first cleared of natural vegetation before being levelled,
and then they were ploughed and harrowed to break down the soil to a workable
state.What amounts to a ‘rustic calendar’ can be seen among the autumnal stars,
where the constellation of the Harrow, which symbolises the preparation of the
fields, rises at the start of month 6. This is then followed, at the end of the month,
by the rising of the Furrow that inaugurates the seeding season.
Watching over the agricultural preparations from on high is the figure
known as Šupa. He represents the high god Enlil, and his celestial image
emphasises the two most prominent facets of the god’s character. Firstly, he is
the principle god of farmers and as such he holds aloft the constellation of the
Plough; secondly, he is the leader of the Babylonian pantheon and to indicate
his exalted rank he holds before him the symbol known as the ‘rod and ring’.
The Wild Boar is the final symbol of the farmers. The boar’s habit of
churning up the earth in search for its food has led it to be called ‘nature’s own
agriculturalist’. It is thus a fitting astral symbol for Ningirsu, the son of Enlil, who
like his father, was one of the principle farming gods of ancient Babylonia.
The farming themes found in the autumnal skies all revolve around the
symbolism of seeding. Although planting the seed effectively brings about its
own ‘death’, it is only through this transformation that a new plant can come
forth. As a mythical metaphor, the dying seed bringing forth a new plant can be compared to the
death and resurrection of the dying god, whose demise is but a prelude to his inevitable return from
the underworld, bringing in his wake all of nature’s bounty.
The final group of constellations found in the autumn skies symbolise the
return of the rainy season. The Raven is sacred to Adad, the god of rain and
storm; and its omens appropriately predict the nature of the coming rains. On the
star-map the Raven is positioned sitting at the end of the Serpent’s tail – in effect
waiting for the summertime drought to come to an end.
The Star of Eridu is similarly concerned with the return of the rains. But
unlike the Raven that symbolises the heaven sent rains, the Star of Eridu’s
overflowing vases emphasize the waters of springs and rivers returning to full
strength after their summer subsidence.
THE FURROW (Pages 115-8)
The origins of Virgo can be traced back to the Babylonian constellation called the Furrow. Like the familiar
Greek image, the Furrow was portrayed as a goddess bearing
an oversize ear of barley. She symbolised the barley fields in
early autumn when they are about to be seeded, and as may
be expected her star was used in astrology to predict the
success or failure of the coming harvest: ‘If the Furrow is dark:
the barley will fall short of its predicted yield, a shortage of
barley and straw will befall the land’.
It would actually be more accurate to regard the modern
image of the Virgin as a combination of two independent Babylonian constellations – the Furrow and the Frond, which
occupy the eastern and western sectors of Virgo respectively.
The Frond, which stands immediately behind the Lion, was depicted as a goddess holding a frond
of the date palm – this attribute has, in fact, been retained in many images of Virgo, where she
bears her barley stalk in one hand and a date palm frond in the other (fig 61).

one of the Uruk tablets

We can speculate that when the ecliptic constellations were formulated into 12 zodiac signs
the independent symbolism of the Furrow and Frond were combined into a single unified figure,
which now represented two of the mainstays of the Babylonian diet – unleavened barley bread and
dates. It is notable that the Babylonian foods have been retained in her imagery, all the more so,
as Greek agriculture was dominated by wheat and olives.
The end result of combining these two
Babylonian constellations into the figure of
Virgo is that she is now one of the largest constellations in the sky. She is positioned
rather uncomfortably, lying prone along the
ecliptic with her head ungraciously set below
Leo’s tail.
When Greek star-lore was transmitted to
Arabia Virgo’s constellation image was modified again. Her barley-stalk, a meaningless symbol
to the desert- dwelling Arabs, was omitted
altogether and she suffered the further indignity
of having one arm cut off above the elbow and
stuck onto her thigh (left) – such brutality being necessary to squeeze her oversize image onto
the star-map.
The constellation of the Furrow is usually written ‘Mul Ab-sin’
MUL AB SIN2
These signs are read as šer’u in Akkadian. The Sumerian word Ab-sin signifies a seeded furrow. The Ab-sign may depict a temple mound. It usually signifies a ‘shrine or precinct’, but its meanings also include
an ‘opening or niche’.
The Sumerian word Sin means ‘to sieve or sift’. The name may encapsulate some kind of allusion to the furrow being carefully seeded.
On a pictorial level, there may be further allusions to the fields being ‘the precinct of
the birds’, as well as a possible reference to the star-map, where the figure of the
Raven stands before the Furrow.
In some astrology texts the Furrow can also be written ‘Mul Ki-hal’
MUL KI HAL The Ki-sign probably depicts a plot of land. It is used to signify a whole range of ideas from ‘ground or floor’, to ‘place or abode’, to ‘district or region’ and even to ‘the
whole earth’ as opposed to heaven.
The Hal-sign can be used to write the verb ‘to divide’. So the likely meaning of these signs would be something like ‘divided earth’, ie a furrow. During the summer months fallow land was prepared for the forthcoming growing season.
The fields were first irrigated to soften up the soil, and then progressively worked with a variety of
ploughs to break down the soil. The seeding-season commenced in month 7, shortly after the
rising of the Furrow, and continued through months 8 and 9. In the Menologies a special akitufestival to mark the seeding season was celebrated in month 8.

Rather than sow the fields by hand, which is rather haphazard and uneconomic,
Mesopotamian farmers developed a special plough called the seed-plough to plant the seed
directly into the furrow. As a general rule the furrows were spaced roughly 3⁄4 of a metre apart – the
spacing between the furrows facilitated irrigation, and allowed easy access for weeding and
harvesting. To this day, very much the same methods are used in undeveloped areas of Turkey.
The image of a barley sheaf actually appears in
the cuneiform writing system as the sign known as
Nidaba (right); it is occasionally used to write ‘grain’, but is more often used with a divine determinative to
signify Nisaba, the ancient goddess of grain. Yet
despite Nisaba’s importance in Mesopotamian culture,
all available star-lists record the regent of the Furrow
as Šala, a little known goddess who originated in the
Hurrian pantheon. Šala was best known as the wife of
Adad, the fecund god of the storm, who was the regent
of the nearby constellation of the Raven. Her barley
stalk and Adad’s lightning bolt are sometimes depicted together on
entitlement stones (fig 64). Their proximity on the star-map and their marriage symbolise the newly seeded fields made fertile by rain and flood.
As Šala and Adad are both Hurrian deities,
they are unlikely to have been assimilated into the
Mesopotamian pantheon any earlier than the last
centuries of the 3rd millennium when the Hurrian
peoples first appear on the historical horizon. Their
incorporation into Babylonian star-lore can be best
understood as an attempt to integrate the Hurrians
into the wider Mesopotamian world.
The symbolism of the Furrow and Raven clearly embody the
autumnal themes of barley seeding and the start of the rainy season,
which is wholly appropriate for a 3rd millennium context. However, way
back in the 5th millennium, when I believe that many of the Babylonian
constellations were originally created, these stars would have risen in the
late summer and would therefore have embodied a rather different
seasonal symbolism.
The cultic nature of late summer is dominated by the observances for the dead. The
mourning rites of Dumuzi were celebrated in month 4, immediately following the summer solstice,
and the ancestors were honoured in the great Brazier festival of month 5. In this ritual the
ancestors were invited back to the world of the living for an annual feast in their ancestral homes.
The most significant part of the ceremony involved lighting torches and braziers to guide the ghosts
of the ancestors back from the darkness of the underworld.
As yet there is no evidence in Babylonian tradition to
support the idea that the Furrow was once connected with
these ancestral rites. But the dual symbolism of farming and
a torch-lit search for departed souls is central to the
mythology of Demeter who is often identified with the figure
of Virgo in Greek star-lore. Demeter was typically portrayed as a goddess holding
an oversize ear of wheat (the Greek equivalent to barley)
and a flaming torch with which she searched the underworld
for her lost daughter. Significantly, she is also occasionally
depicted along with a bird, which several writers on early
Greek religion have independently identified as a ‘soul-bird’
(fig 65).

In light of this, I believe that there is a distinct
possibility that the symbolism of Demeter actually records
the changing attributes of the Babylonian constellation
from an archaic ancestral goddess holding a flaming
torch who was originally associated with late summer to a
farming goddess with an ear of barley associated with the
autumn seeding season. In other words, the symbolic
attributes of the goddess have ultimately been defined by
the changing location of her constellation in the cultic
calendar.
The archaic forms of the Furrow and the Raven can
now be tentatively restored as a ‘Torch-bearing goddess’
and a ‘Soul-bird’, which represents an ancestral ghost
returning from the realm of the dead (right). See also: the Frond of Erua, the Harrow, the Raven,

THE POST-AUTUMN EQUINOX PERIOD (Pages 34-35)
As the autumn equinox passes, the nights start to outlast the days and once again darkness
triumphs over light. As the sun and the dying gods descend into the darkness of the underworld,
the spirits of the dead travel the long road that leads to the realm of the ancestors. The
constellations that rise at this sacred juncture appropriately enough portray the themes of descent
into darkness and the serpent-bodied guardians of the underworld who guide the spirits of the
dead ever onward towards their final resting place among the stars.
The autumn skies are dominated by the enormous
figure of the Scorpion. Its array of weaponry has led it to be
regarded as a creature symbolising war and the martial
prowess of the king. And its venomous nature further
expresses the autumnal themes of death and descent to the
underworld. A similar theme is also reflected in the attribution

the Autumn Equinox

of the Scorpion’s brightest star to the goddess called Lisi, whose name is used as a generic title for
groups of lamenting goddesses.
Nevertheless, the Scorpion’s mythical nature within the stellar calendar is most clearly
revealed in the Epic of Gilgamesh where the gate of the sun is guarded by a pair of scorpionpeople. The gate marks the start of an underground tunnel that was travelled by the sun during the
course of each night and was traversed by Gilgamesh on his way to the visit the immortals who
lived beyond the confines of this world. In terms of the sun’s annual circuit of the stars this tunnel
can naturally be thought of as symbolising the sun’s autumnal descent into the darkness of the
underworld. The constellation of the Scales, which was formed from the Scorpion’s
Claws long ago, is held to be particularly sacred to the sun god Šamaš. In the first
place, the Scales symbolise the autumn equinox, when the watches of day and
night are held to be of equal duration and the sun rises due east and sets due
west. And secondly, the Scales symbolise the idea of judicial prudence, as in the
phrase ‘weighing up the evidence’, which is particularly appropriate to the sun god
as his principle role within the Babylonian pantheon was to act as the arbitrator of
truth and justice. For these reasons the Scales are thought to be the special station of the sun in
Babylonian astrology, where they are purposefully set opposite to the moon’s station in the Star
Cluster (the Pleiades). The strange serpent-bodied figures called the Sitting and Standing Gods
represent the ancestors of Enlil. They lived in the Sacred Mound, which was not only a
grave mound covering a passageway to the underworld but was also the source of all
earthly fertility. Various texts speak of them guiding discarnate souls to the land of no
return, some sources even describe them performing the duties of judging the dead
and determining their destinies.
Behind the serpent-bodied gods is the figure of Zababa. Very little is known
about this ancient god beyond the fact he was a warrior god who was closely
associated with the symbol of the eagle. As so little is known about Zababa, the
constellation image offered here is admittedly little more than an educated guess.
The strange figure known as the Mad Dog is made up of a combination of
human and leonine elements. It is, I believe, an ancient relic that would originally
have been paired to the Bison-man. Together they constituted an image of the ‘lion
bull conflict’, which represented the incessant seasonal conflict between the drought
bringing lion of summer and the fertile rains of spring and autumn, which were
symbolised by the bull. Here in the autumn skies the Bison-man was portrayed
overcoming the summer lion – his victory over the lion thus symbolised the welcome
return of the rainy season. However, the Bison-man has subsequently been removed
from the star-map, leaving the Mad Dog as an isolated relic of former times. (See
appendix 2 for more details)
THE SCALES (Pages 175-7)
Long ago the stars that comprised the Scorpion Claws were transformed into a new
constellation called the Scales, which we know today as the zodiac constellation of Libra. The
beam of the Scales was slotted into the space between the Scorpion’s forearms and the weighing
pans were directly overlaid upon the Scorpion’s Claws. Greek astronomers from Ptolemy onwards
continued to call the weighing pans of Libra the ‘Claws of the
Scorpion’ and the title then passed into Arabic tradition and
thence into the modern stellar nomenclature, where the
principle stars of the weighing pans are still known as the
‘northern and southern claws’.
The scales in question are not simply a pair of pans
suspended on a beam, they also incorporate some kind of
mechanism, presumably a needle and measuring scale, that
would allow a more accurate reading to be made. Something
of this nature can be seen on one of the few surviving images
of the Scales (right).
114 The Great Twins and the Scales
from a late Uruk seal

In all earlier texts the Scales are known by their Akkadian name zibānu, which is spelt out in syllabic fashion ‘Mul Zi-ba-an-na’
MUL ZI BA AN NA In Akkadian the Scales are also known as zibānītu – ‘a set of weighing scales’. In later periods the Scales could also be written ‘Mul Giš Erin2’.
The Erin-sign had by this time become assimilated to a variant of
the sign for sun called the Zalag-sign – a testament to the close affinity between the Scales and the Sun.
Like so many changes in celestial imagery the transformation of the Scorpion’s Claws into the
Scales was ultimately due to precession, which had gradually shifted these stars into the region of
the heavens that rose at the time of the autumn equinox. The equinox is rightly symbolised by the
Scales because at this time of year the watches of day and night are exactly equal to each other,
and when the sun is in the constellation of the Scales it rises due east and sets due west. The
concept of balance is also applied to the sun and full moon, which are said to be ‘in balance’, that
is on opposite horizons, on the 14th day of the month: ‘If the moon and the sun are in balance: the
land will be stable, the people will speak truth, the king of the land will make his throne endure’. The idea is developed in Sumerian literature where the rising place of the sun can sometimes be
referred to as the ‘weighing place’: ‘As day breaks, as the sun god rises, the sun god stands at the
weighing place’.
For these reasons the constellation of the
Scales, as well as standardized weights and
measures, were held to be especially sacred to the
sun god Šamaš (Utu in Sumerian). The Scales symbolised his primary role within Mesopotamian
culture as the god of truth and justice. Some of the
reasoning behind these attributions is plain enough
– the sun illuminates the world and therefore sees
everything that happens upon the earth. He is the
ultimate witness of all actions and therefore the
arbiter of truth, and it was believed that he would
punish anyone foolish enough to swear false
witness. Kings and heroes, as well as ordinary
men, called upon him as the upholder of truth and
righteousness and petitioned him to rectify the
iniquities they suffered.
Another of the sun god’s characteristic
symbols was the serrated saw. He is sometimes
thought to use this saw to cut through the mountains to affect his release from the underworld, but
a handful of seals clearly show a warrior god cutting off the hand of a criminal with a scimitar-like
weapon. So this might well indicate that the intended meaning of the saw was as a symbol of
retributive justice – a literary reference in a hymn to Nabu goes some way to confirm this when it
states ‘You are able to impose the saw of the sun god on crooks’.
In fact the sun god’s saw and scales can still be recognised in the modern figure of ‘justice’
that stands above the British law courts. She is blindfolded to symbolise her impartiality, and holds
the sword of punishment in one hand and the scales of judgement in the other.
In Babylonian astrology the Scales and the Sun both have a special relationship to Saturn,
which is often called ‘the star of the sun’ or ‘the path of the sun’ in astrological omens and
commentaries, and like the sun it can also be called the ‘star of truth and justice’. This association
between the Sun, Saturn and the Scales is known from astrology texts dating to the 13th century

BCE and can also be seen in some of the earlier versions of the Astrolabes. Part of the association
has survived into modern astrology where Saturn is still thought to have its exaltation in Libra. Reflecting the importance of the solar-lunar opposition at full moon the Babylonian system
purposefully places the sacred station of the sun in the Scales, diametrically opposite to the Moon’s
special station in the Star Cluster (our Pleiades). See also: the Scorpion’s Claws and Appendix 16

It is now well known that the constellations of the Zodiac originated in the ancient
land of Babylonia (modern day Iraq). Yet, despite more than a century and a half of scholarship, very little information on this subject has been made accessible to the non
specialist. We are very grateful to Gavin White for allowing us to reproduce excerpts of his recently published Babylonian Star-lore. Over the forthcoming months these articles will
help to address this deficiency by presenting the lore and symbolism of the twelve Babylonian Zodiac constellations.

THE POST-AUTUMN EQUINOX PERIOD (Pages 34-35)
As the autumn equinox passes, the nights start to outlast the days and once again darkness triumphs over light. As the sun and the dying gods descend into the darkness of the underworld, the spirits of the dead travel the long road that leads to the realm of the ancestors. The constellations that rise at this sacred juncture appropriately enough portray the themes of descent into darkness and the serpent-bodied guardians of the underworld who guide the spirits of the dead ever onward towards their final resting place among the stars.
The autumn skies are dominated by the enormous figure
of the Scorpion. Its array of weaponry has led it to be regarded
as a creature symbolising war and the martial prowess of the
king. And its venomous nature further expresses the autumnal
themes of death and descent to the underworld. A similar
theme is also reflected in the attribution of the Scorpion’s
brightest star to the goddess called Lisi, whose name is used as a generic title for groups of
lamenting goddesses.

Nevertheless, the Scorpion’s mythical nature within the stellar calendar is most clearly revealed
in the Epic of Gilgamesh where the gate of the sun is guarded by a pair of scorpion-people. The gate marks the start of an underground tunnel that was travelled by the sun during the course of each
night and was traversed by Gilgamesh on his way to the visit the immortals who lived beyond the
confines of this world. In terms of the sun’s annual circuit of the stars this tunnel can naturally be
thought of as symbolising the sun’s autumnal descent into the darkness of the underworld.
The constellation of the Scales, which was formed from the Scorpion’s Claws
long ago, is held to be particularly sacred to the sun god Šamaš. In the first place,
the Scales symbolise the autumn equinox, when the watches of day and night are
held to be of equal duration and the sun rises due east and sets due west. And
secondly, the Scales symbolise the idea of judicial prudence, as in the phrase
‘weighing up the evidence’, which is particularly appropriate to the sun god as his
principle role within the Babylonian pantheon was to act as the arbitrator of truth and
justice. For these reasons the Scales are thought to be the special station of the sun in Babylonian
astrology, where they are purposefully set opposite to the moon’s station in the Star Cluster (the
Pleiades).
The strange serpent-bodied figures called the Sitting and Standing Gods
represent the ancestors of Enlil. They lived in the Sacred Mound, which was not only a
grave mound covering a passageway to the underworld but was also the source of all
earthly fertility. Various texts speak of them guiding discarnate souls to the land of no
return, some sources even describe them performing the duties of judging the dead
and determining their destinies.
Behind the serpent-bodied gods is the figure of Zababa. Very little is known
about this ancient god beyond the fact he was a warrior god who was closely
associated with the symbol of the eagle. As so little is known about Zababa, the
constellation image offered here is admittedly little more than an educated guess.
The strange figure known as the Mad Dog is made up of a combination of human and
leonine elements. It is, I believe, an ancient relic that would originally have been paired
to the Bison-man. Together they constituted an image of the ‘lion-bull conflict’, which
represented the incessant seasonal conflict between the drought-bringing lion of
summer and the fertile rains of spring and autumn, which were symbolised by the bull.
Here in the autumn skies the Bison-man was portrayed overcoming the summer lion
his victory over the lion thus symbolised the welcome return of the rainy season.
However, the Bison-man has subsequently been removed from the star-map, leaving
the Mad Dog as an isolated relic of former times. (See appendix 2 for more details)
THE SCORPION (Pages 177-80)
The Scorpion’s array of weaponry and its
armoured body segments has naturally led it to
symbolise the clash of weapons in battle and
the martial prowess of the king: ‘If the Scorpion
comes close to the front of the moon and stands there: the reign of the king will become
long; an enemy will attack but will fall’. In
literature it is described posed for attack with ‘its
pincers extended like the horns of a wild bull,
and its tail raised up like that of a raging lion’.
In the artwork of the Akkadian period the
scorpion is commonly combined with the
features of men and birds to produce a range of
composite beings called Scorpion-men (left). Their mythic nature is most clearly revealed in
the Epic of Gilgamesh where a Scorpion-man and woman act as guardians to the mythic mountain

beneath which the sun descends every night. They are said to
guard the sun at his rising and setting, and because Gilgamesh is
a favourite of the sun god they allow him to travel the path of the
sun under the mountain. The epic describes how Gilgamesh
travels through the tunnel during the night and eventually
emerges into a gem-encrusted paradise, on his quest to find
immortality.
Scorpion-men become increasingly popular figures in 1st
millennium artwork where they still appear as attendants to the
sun god. In terms of the stellar calendar the Scorpion marks the
descent of the sun into the darkness of the underworld – its
poisonous sting, which rises just before the winter solstice,
symbolises the death of the sun and the dissolution of the year.
In Sumerian the Scorpion is written ‘Mul Gir-tab’
MUL GIR2 TAB
The scorpion is called zuqaqīpu in Akkadian – the name is derived from the
verb zaqāpu, which has a number of meanings including ‘to erect, impale or rise
up’ – an obvious allusion to the raised stinger of the scorpion. The Gir-sign depicts a sword or dagger; it is used as an element in the names of all types of blades. This has led to the Scorpion being called the ‘Sword of
Heaven’.
The Tab-sign has a wide range of meanings – it can be used to write the verb ‘to double’, or to write ‘twin or companion’. Its less common meanings are
probably more relevant here – ‘to burn up’ by fire or fever; and a ‘sting or sharp
point’.
So the combination Gir-tab probably means something like the ‘sharp weapon’ or ‘burning sting’ – another reference to the scorpion’s stinger.
In Babylonian astrology the Scorpion is divided into three main components, each with its own
associated deities and star-lore: • The Claws or Horns, which were later transformed into the Scales • The Breast, which is sacred to Lisi, the goddess of lamentations • The Stinger, which represents the battle-maces of the warrior god Ninurta
The Scorpion in its entirety is attributed to the multifaceted goddess Išhara. She was
worshipped by many peoples and nations throughout the Ancient Near East, which has led to a
confusing array of attributions – she is known as a great goddess to the Hurrians, the wife of Dagon
among the West Semites, and to the Akkadians she was a goddess of love with close affinities to
Ištar, whose sacred plant cannabis (qunnabu) was known as the ‘aromatic of Išhara’. In astrology
texts she is sometimes called ‘Išhara of the ocean’ (Išhara Tiamat), a name applied to Venus, and
from her widespread worship she is also known as the ‘queen of the inhabited world’.
Notwithstanding these varied aspects of her character, Išhara is overwhelmingly known as a
goddess of war and victory in astrology texts and related literature. On entitlement stones her warlike
nature is revealed in the epithet ‘mistress of victory over the lands’ and in curses she is entreated ‘not
to hear him in the midst of mighty battle’. In a similar vein, she is sometimes regarded as the mother
of the Seven Gods, the warmongering regents of the Star Cluster.
In astrology the fortunes of war can be predicted by comparing the ideal time of the Scorpion’s
rising – in month 8 – to the actual time of its first appearance: ‘The Scorpion rises in month 8: If this
star rises early: the king will go about proudly; he will subdue his enemies. If this star rises late: the kings of all lands will start hostilities against the king’.

When warlike planets such as
Mars are present in the Scorpion the
forecast is predictably dire: ‘If Nergal
(Mars) stands in the Scorpion: a strong enemy will carry off the land; Enlil will give his weapons to the enemy; a few enemy troops will
defeat my numerous troops’. One of
the worst predictions in the whole
corpus of celestial omens must be: ‘If
the Plough (Mars) comes close to the Scorpion: the ruler will die by the sting of a scorpion’.
Beyond its warlike nature the
Scorpion has also accumulated
various seasonal attributions
associated with the autumn months. The illustration above depicts a ritual ploughing scene in which
the gods are seeding the fields. Its main point of interest is the inclusion of a scorpion and a dog on
the far left-hand side. Assuming that these two figures are not simply decorative, there is the
intriguing possibility that they are calendrical in nature and are referring to the constellations of the
Scorpion and Sitting Dog. These constellations rise in month 7 and 8, when the seeding season
commences – in the Menologies the festival of the seeding season is specifically celebrated in month 8. So this seal could be one of the earliest examples of using the constellations in a rustic calendar.
Further seasonal attributes can be found in the Astrolabes where we learn that the Scorpion is thought to be ‘favourable for the price of oil’ – the constellation rises as the sesame harvest finishes
and the new season’s oil comes onto the market. An incomplete omen
illustrates this usage: ‘If the Scorpion rises in month 8, the market for wool and
oil will...’ The missing prediction is likely to be favourable, as the Scorpion
should indeed rise in month 8.
The Scorpion’s association with trade and the commodity markets is
probably derived from the fact that its Claws were long ago converted into the
Scales, which are the natural emblem of merchants and traders alike. The
association is even evident in the Hittite astrology text that declares that a child
born in month 8 ‘will buy grain and silver’. The astrological series EAE contains some early examples of using astrology to speculate on the markets. The
paradigm is briefly stated: ‘the Scorpion is for the market’ and is worked out in
a series of six omens detailing the progress of Jupiter through the body of the
Scorpion, its changing positions are interpreted as dramatic changes in the
home and foreign markets: ‘If Sagmegar (Jupiter) reaches the head of the
Scorpion: in Akkad the market will be halved’, or if it reaches its stinger ‘the market will be halved in Elam’.

THE WINTER SOLSTICE PERIOD
The sacred cycle of the stars comes to a close with the appearance of the wintertime constellations. These stars depict the final stages of the stellar calendar when the sun once more descends to its lowest point in the skies drawing ever closer to the longest night. This is the time when the disembodied souls of mankind are spirited away from the environs of the earth and are driven up into the circumpolar regions of heaven to join their ancestors. The constellations in this part of the sky demonstrate that the ‘underworld’ is not actually located below the earth as common sense might dictate but is actually found among the stars. The evidence further indicates that the Milky Way itself was either directly envisioned as the pathway of the dead or that each of its myriad stars was thought to represent an individual soul on its journey to the afterlife.

At the base of the Milky Way we find Pabilsag, the Babylonian prototype of our Sagittarius, whose name means the ‘Fore-Father’ or ‘ChiefAncestor’. His function within the stellar calendar was to drive discarnate souls from the environs of the earth up into the heavens. In this role he bears many similarities to the god of the wild hunt found in western folklore. The Eagle continues the same vein of symbolism; its mythic function is two-fold. In general terms, it acts as a guide to the dead, transporting the Dead Man to the underworld just as the Greek Harpies were sometimes thought to do. More specifically, it can also be thought of carrying away the soul of an evildoer for some special punishment – effectively denying him a place in the ancestral realms. In the northern reaches of the winter skies we find the Panther, the sacred beast of Nergal, the king of the dead. It is arguable that his constellation image has been set in the upper reaches of the Milky Way to guard the entrance of the celestial underworld, an important part of which was located in the circumpolar regions. The circle of life is now complete as the souls of the dead rejoin their
ancestors among the stars. But even the underworld is not an absolute end to the cycle of life – it is in fact a new beginning – as souls destined for a new birth now depart the ancestral realm and travel towards the worlds of the living. The constellation of the Cargo-boat has been placed among the stars to represent just this process – the boat upon the waters represents the foetus in the amniotic fluid and its ‘cargo’ is composed of symbols that indicate the sex of the child.
PABILSAG (Pages 155-8) The origins of Sagittarius, the Archer, are to be found in the strange composite figure known as Pabilsag. The familiar image of the Greek constellation as a horse-centaur armed with a bow and arrow is, in fact, a simplified version of the Babylonian figure, which is a truly composite character with a number of features not seen in the Greek version, such as a set of wings, a scorpion’s tail and the head of a dog. The details of Pabilsag’s iconography show a considerable amount of variation – some depictions omit the wings or dog’s head altogether, while other images can replace its back legs with those of a bird (fig 99). Although the basic image of the horse-centaur can only be traced back to the middle of the 2nd millennium (the Kassite period), the figure is undoubtedly older as the constellation name appears in the star-lists of the preceding Old Babylonian period. A potentially older form of the Archer that doesn’t have any horse characteristics can also be found on entitlement stones. It combines the features of a human archer with a scorpion’s body and birdlike feet (right). Very similar creatures first appear in Akkadian artwork where they can have wings and often have a snake-headed phallus. It isn’t known if these Akkadian images represent an early form of Pabilsag, nevertheless their iconography certainly seems to have influenced its later appearance.

The constellation of Pabilsag is written ‘Mul Pa-bil-sag’
MUL PA BIL SAG The Sumerian word Pabil means ‘ancestor or relative’. In combination with the final element sag, meaning ‘chief or foremost’, his name can be translated as the ‘Chief Ancestor’ or ‘Forefather’. Additional epithets like ‘the weapon with a burning tip’ or ‘he who strikes with a burning point’ can be derived from the individual signs used to write Pabilsag’s name. The Pa-sign depicts two branches; it has several meanings including ‘sceptre’ and ‘staff’ and can also be used to write the verb ‘to strike’ or ‘to beat’. The Bil-sign depicts a flaming brazier; it can be used to write ‘burning, stinging, hot’. Braziers were commonly employed in rituals dedicated to the ancestors. The Sag-sign depicts a human head; it refers to the ‘top or tip’ of something, and is also used to signify ‘first, foremost or top quality’.
From the Old Babylonian period Pabilsag is frequently identified with the god Ninurta, but apart from this very little is known concerning him beyond the bare facts that he was, like Ninurta, a son of Enlil and the earliest evidence of his worship can be dated to the 3rd millennium BCE. Babylonian star-lore reveals that his immediate family were also represented among the stars – his wife, the healing goddess commonly called Ninisina or Gula, has her celestial station in the She-Goat, and their son Damu, ‘the child’, who is annually reborn after midwinter is represented among the stars in the form of the Swine-star. Pabilsag’s wife has the dog as her divine symbol, which may go some way to explain why he has a dog’s head springing from his shoulders. His name, Pabil-sag, reveals him to be the ‘Chief Ancestor’ or ‘Forefather’. But this statement only begs a host of further questions concerning the nature of the ancestors and the state of the human soul in the afterlife. Some of the answers concerning the nature of the soul can be found in the Epic of Gilgamesh, where Enkidu, the hero’s companion, dreams of his own impending death. He dreamt that he stood between heaven and earth, and that a ‘man’ with the face of an Anzu-bird seized him, turned him into a dove and carried him off, wings bound, to the house of no return. In his ensuing vision of the netherworld, Enkidu saw the unhappy host of the dead gathered around in the form of spirits, ‘clad in coats of feathers’.
Recognisably the same conception can be found in Greek mythology, where ghosts are sometimes depicted as tiny winged men and women hovering about the tomb (see fig 96). Death too, can be thought of as the soul being ‘snatched away’ by a death-demon. The Greeks saw these death-demons as Harpies, literally the ‘Snatchers’, and envisioned them as bird-women – their images sometimes adorn gravestones where they can be seen carrying off the souls of the dead to the underworld, as did the Anzu-bird in archaic Mesopotamian art. But there is a second element in the symbolic equation – the Harpies, like the Anzu-bird, are also personifications of the winds. And the winds, like the ancestors, have the power to fertilise, to generate new life. Hence the famous quote from Virgil that mares could be impregnated by the wind. So the ghosts of the dead can be envisioned as birds or winged men and women, their feathery symbolism further conveys the idea that the essential nature of the soul is breath or wind.

The whole range of functions associated with the ancestors is exemplified by the Athenian Tritopatres, the ‘forefathers of the third generation’, who are winds, even ‘lords of the winds’ as well as ghosts. The young men of Athens made offerings to them before their marriage, no doubt to ensure a healthy patrimony of sons and heirs. The foregoing discussion drawing on Greek and Babylonian traditions has sketched out some of the most basic features associated with the ancestors; by returning to the Babylonian evidence we can now penetrate deeper into the mysteries of the Chief Ancestor.
Concerning Pabilsag’s constellation two factors immediately stand out as highly significant. Firstly, his star rises in the ninth month of the year, which is the final month of the symbolic calendar imprinted upon the stars. This is the time of year that the sun descends to its lowest ebb at the winter solstice and the gates to the underworld are opened symbolising the transition between death and new life. Secondly, Pabilsag is located directly within the course of the Milky Way where it abruptly rises from the southern regions close to the horizon into the higher reaches of the heavens. Judging by the other constellations found in this part of the sky, such as the Eagle and the Panther, this section of the Milky Way arguably represents the souls of the dead on their way to the afterlife. Taken together these features paint a picture of Pabilsag as a guardian and guide to the souls of the deceased. In many of his essential features he can therefore be equated with the figure of the Wild Hunter found in western folklore. The theme of the hunt, inherent in his bow and arrow and in various images (right) where he hunts down a demon or an antelope, merely disguises the ancestor’s role as the guide to the deceased, spiriting away the souls of the dead with the winds, away from the earth and into the heavens above.
The themes of death and destruction are very apparent in the astrological lore of Pabilsag. So far only omens for Jupiter’s presence have been recovered but these paint a pretty desolate picture predicting destruction and carnage for the land, and the death of the prince. Like the other ecliptic constellations that rise during the winter Pabilsag has surprisingly few omens explicitly attributed to him. This lack of omens is ingenuously circumvented by Babylonian astrologers by identifying his component parts with other independent star figures of a similar appearance – in this instance, Pabilsag’s arrow can be identified with the constellation of the Arrow (properly speaking the star Sirius, which marks the summer solstice), and his scorpion-tail can be identified with the Scorpion’s Stinger. The close affinity between Pabilsag and Ninurta may have contributed to these particular identifications, as both the Arrow and the Scorpion’s Stinger are closely associated with Ninurta in astrological lore.

THE POST-WINTER SOLSTICE PERIOD (Pages 25-7)
Unlike the familiar calendar system that commences in the spring, the symbolic cycle embodied in the stars makes most sense when you start and end with the winter solstice. When the longest night is celebrated, the sun’s power is at its weakest and it has reached its lowest and most southerly station in the heavens. But the crucial turning point has been attained and from this time onwards the sun’s light and power increase day by day. The period following on from the winter solstice thus celebrates the rebirth of the sun from the waters of chaos and the reemergence of life, in all its manifold forms, from the realm of darkness and death.
As mythical symbols, the Horse and Stag both represent
the rebirth of the sun. This is most clearly seen in the mythology
of the horse, whose principle mythic duty was to pull the chariot
of the sun. The solar chariot ultimately governs the three major
cycles of time recognised in myth – the rising of the chariot
announces the dawn of each and every day, its annual rising
after mid-winter ushers in the New Year, and in terms of the
whole cycle of creation its rising celebrates the original birth of
the sun from the primordial waters of chaos. The Horse was probably chosen for this exalted role
because of its speed and its shimmering mane, which was thought to represent radiating beams of
sunlight.
First Sector – the constellations rising after mid-winter

The Stag is, in many respects, a very similar symbol to the Horse; it too has an age-old
association to the sun and fire, and like the horse’s mane the stag’s horns also represent rays of
sunlight. The annual renewal of its horns further predisposes it to be a symbol of rebirth, and in the
form of the reindeer sledge of Father Christmas, the Stag is still honoured to this day as the symbol
of the sun’s wintertime passage. As symbols of solar rebirth the Horse and the Stag are thus very
appropriate symbols to find at the very start of the stellar calendar.
The same theme of solar rebirth is expressed in a somewhat
different form in the adjacent constellations known as Anunitum,
the Swallow and the Field. These star figures together constitute a
vivid depiction of the ‘myth of the Syrian goddess’, which can be
thought of as the master-myth of this season. The myth runs as
follows – two fish found an enormous egg floating in the depths of
the river Euphrates, the fish guided the egg up from the watery depths of the river and rolled it onto
dry land, where a dove appeared and started to brood it. In due time, the Syrian goddess herself
was born from the egg. On account of this myth, fish and birds were held to be particularly sacred
to the Syrian goddess.
The star-map indicates that the setting of this myth and its participants are not, in fact, of this
earth, but are to be found in the heavens. What is of pivotal importance is the identity of the ‘river
Euphrates’. Apart from the earthly river, the ‘Euphrates’ can also be found on the star-map where it
is closely associated with the watery outflow joined to the Swallow. This heavenly river actually
runs parallel to the course of the ecliptic (represented by the dotted line on the main map) and now
that this fact is established, the action of the fish can be better understood – they escort the sun
(the mythical egg) from its lowest point at the solstice and guide it onto its ascending path that
leads towards the spring and ‘dry land’, which is represented on the star-map by the constellation
of the Field. The myth as a whole can now be understood as an image of time that has guided us
from the darkness of winter to the beginning of spring.
Continuing the watery theme we next encounter the Babylonian
equivalents to Capricorn and Aquarius, known as the Goatfish and the Great One. The compound nature of the Goatfish is best understood in terms of the
symbolism that we have already examined. In short, I would argue that it is
essentially a combination of the Stag and the Fish – the Stag representing the
renewal of the sun’s power at midwinter, while the Fish acts as a guardian to
the nascent sun and guides it upon the first stages of its ascending path.
The watery symbolism continues in the figure known as the Great One,
the Babylonian name for our Aquarius. As a seasonal symbol, the Great One with his overflowing vases symbolises the increased rains and floods of winter
and early spring. Along with the constellation of the Field, which represents a
plot of arable land, the Great One can be thought of as the ‘Irrigator’ – as the
rising of these constellations mark the season when the ripening barley is
irrigated before the springtime harvest.
Although the precise location of the Swine is still a matter of debate, it is
very likely that his star is to be found in the rebirth sector of the star-map as it
is attributed to the god Damu, whose name can be translated as the ‘child’.
Mythic texts portray Damu as one of the dying gods, closely related to Dumuzi,
who vanished from the earth and was mourned by his mother and sister. Like
all the dying gods he does eventually return to the earth – and true to form,
myths speak of him escaping from the underworld via a river.
All in all, the symbolism of the constellations that rise after the winter solstice concur in
depicting a time when the sun re-emerges from the darkness of winter and starts its ascent into the
heavens. Similarly, in the unfolding lifecycle of the dying god, Damu (the ‘Child’), escapes from the
underworld and starts to make his way back to the upper worlds.
The image of the child escaping the underworld, and of the nascent sun dwelling within the
waters, can also be interpreted in human terms as the foetus dwelling within the creative waters of
the womb. The multitude of images all relate one essential truth – that life, in all its myriad forms,
takes shape within the creative waters.

THE GOATFISH (Pages 118-21)
The Goatfish is the Babylonian prototype of our
modern-day Capricorn. This strange creature, which
combines the head and forelimbs of a goat with the body of
a fish, is first seen in Mesopotamian art towards the end of
the 3rd millennium. Presuming that it was a constellation
figure at this early date, its strange form has adorned the
winter skies for the last 4,000 years or more.
The Greek and Babylonian figures are almost
identical, in fact the only noticeable change to occur in the
process of its transmission was that the Greek constellation
has ended up with a somewhat longer tail that is sometimes
coiled around itself and sometimes tied in a knot.
The constellation of the Goatfish is written ‘Mul Suhur-Maš-Ku’
MUL SUHUR MAŠ2 KU6
The Sumerian name has been transmitted into Akkadian as suhurmāšu – the
mythical ‘goatfish’. The Suhur-sign probably depicts a bunch of leaves; it is used to signify a ‘tuft, plume or crest’.
The Maš-sign represents a ‘goat-kid or lamb’.
The whole sequence is terminated by the Ku-sign signifying the class of fish. The whole name can therefore be translated as ‘the crested goat-fish’.
Even though the Goatfish is part of the zodiac, and
thus constantly interacting with the sun, moon and
planets, it has surprisingly little lore directly associated
with it in either Babylonian or Greek traditions.
Consequently, if we want to describe the symbolic
nature of the constellation, we have to fall back on other,
more indirect methods.
The first clue to understanding the nature of the
Goatfish lies in its calendrical behaviour. In the mid to
late 3rd millennium, when I believe the Goatfish was
originally created, its head and horns would have risen
at the time of the winter solstice, while it’s fishtail would
only have become fully visible during course of the
following month. This all suggests that its character is
likely to be informed by the rebirth symbolism
associated with the winter solstice.
Further information can potentially be gleaned by examining the Goatfish in the context of the
constellations surrounding it on the star-map. There is every reason to believe that the Goatfish is
one of the newer generation of stars, and if this is the case, there may well be older constellations,
still present on the star-map, that embody the same seasonal symbolism. As such, they offer the
possibility of describing the diverse elements of the Goatfish in terms of other better-known
constellation symbols. We can further infer that these older constellations would be located behind
the figure of the Goatfish and, in terms of their calendrical behaviour, they would probably rise
between one and two months later.
Given the terms of this hypothesis, we can now postulate that the goat-element of the
Goatfish is an equivalent symbol to the Stag, which was an archaic constellation closely associated
with the rebirth of the sun. Likewise, its fish-element is either derived from Anunitum or the Fish

constellation, whose astral lore reveals that the mythical fish was thought to rescue the sun from
the watery depths of winter and guide it safely towards dry land.
In summary, we can now conclude that the Goatfish was newly created in the latter part of
the 3rd millennium to symbolise the rebirth aspect of the winter solstice. Its component parts reveal
it to be the guardian and guide of the newborn sun as it re-emerges from the waters of darkness
and death.
Like a number of wintertime constellations embodying aquatic symbolism, the Goatfish
became increasingly associated with Enki during the course of the 2nd millennium. Enki or Ea was one of the great trinity of deities recognised in Babylonian tradition. He was loved and respected as
a wise and benevolent god who, long before the Great Flood, had invented the arts and crafts of
civilisation. Alongside the Seven Sages, he was thought to live in the freshwater Abyss that
extended below the earth, where he was attended by a whole entourage of mythical beings such
as water-monsters, mermaids and mermen.
The close affinity between Enki and the Goatfish is manifest
on numerous entitlement stones where the Goatfish is often
combined with other astral symbols associated with him such as the
turtle or the Ram-headed staff (right). Despite the strong affinity to Enki, astrology texts list the
regent of the Goatfish as the little-known goddess Tašmetu. Her
name is derived from the Akkadian word šamû, and can be roughly translated as ‘the granter of requests’. She is regarded as the wife
of the scribe god Nabu, who is the regent of the nearby Cargo-Boat.
In the whole corpus of celestial omens there are only a
handful of omens that actually concern the Goatfish. One of the few
to survive describes the presence of Mars: ‘If Mars rides the
Goatfish: devastation of Eridu, its people will be annihilated’. The negative prediction here is
somewhat unexpected as Mars is considered to have its exaltation in the Goatfish. The
circumstance of Mars ‘riding’ the Goatfish – whatever that might mean – probably indicates some
sort of behaviour that is thought to be outside the normal parameters of the planet’s behaviour, and
in the minds of astrologers anything acting outside its ‘normal’ pattern of behaviour is a sign of ill
portenBt.abylonian astrologers have overcome the apparent lack of omens for the Goatfish by
dividing the creature into its component parts – the goat and the fish – and then applying omens
from other goat-like and fish-like constellations. So, in practice, the head of the Goatfish can be
treated as the She-Goat (properly speaking a northern constellation corresponding to Lyra), whose
omens chiefly concern the well-being of the herds. And its fishtail can be described in terms of the
Fish-constellation (corresponding to Pisces Austrinus), which is used to foretell the abundance of the seas and the nature of the floods. Numerous examples of this practice can be drawn from the
State Archives: ‘If Venus approaches the Fish: there will be a defeat in the land’ – Venus approaches the Goatfish.
But astrologers didn’t stop here – another way of referring to the Goatfish without actually
mentioning its name was to call it the ‘Star of Ea’: ‘If the Star of Ea is dark: the harvest will not
thrive, for 3 years ... will devour’ – Mercury is faint in the Goatfish. As a celestial sign, a ‘dark’
planet generally forebodes ill. The negative prediction here should be compared with the following
omen that also describes the (presumably bright) appearance of Mercury in the Goatfish: ‘If the
Fish (the Goatfish) stands close to the Raven (Mercury): fish and fowl will thrive’ – Mercury is visible in the Goatfish.
Even the foregoing examples do not exhaust the range of omens applicable to the Goatfish
a closer examination of the sources reveals that the Goatfish can also be referred to by other
constellation names such as the Yoke, the Crab and the Kidney, although it must be said that the
reasons behind these identifications are entirely obscure.

It is now well known that the constellations of the Zodiac originated in the ancient land of Babylonia (modern day Iraq).

THE POST-WINTER SOLSTICE PERIOD (Pages 25-7)
Unlike the familiar calendar system that commences in the spring, the symbolic cycle embodied in the stars makes most sense when you start and end with the winter solstice. When the longest night is celebrated, the sun’s power is at its weakest and it has reached its lowest and most southerly station in the heavens. But the crucial turning point has been attained and from this time onwards the sun’s light and power increase day by day. The period following on from the winter solstice thus celebrates the rebirth of the sun from the waters of chaos and the reemergence of life, in all its manifold forms, from the realm of darkness and death.
As mythical symbols, the Horse and Stag both represent the rebirth of the sun. This is most clearly seen in the mythology of the horse, whose principle mythic duty was to pull the chariot of the sun. The solar chariot ultimately governs the three major cycles of time recognised in myth – the rising of the chariot announces the dawn of each and every day, its annual rising after mid-winter ushers in the New Year, and in terms of the whole cycle of creation its rising celebrates the original birth of the sun from the primordial waters of chaos. The Horse was probably chosen for this exalted role because of its speed and its shimmering mane, which was thought to represent radiating beams of sunlight.
First Sector – the constellations rising after mid-winter

The Stag is, in many respects, a very similar symbol to the Horse; it too has an age-old association to the sun and fire, and like the horse’s mane the stag’s horns also represent rays of sunlight. The annual renewal of its horns further predisposes it to be a symbol of rebirth, and in the form of the reindeer sledge of Father Christmas, the Stag is still honoured to this day as the symbol of the sun’s wintertime passage. As symbols of solar rebirth the Horse and the Stag are thus very appropriate symbols to find at the very start of the stellar calendar. The same theme of solar rebirth is expressed in a somewhat different form in the adjacent constellations known as Anunitum, the Swallow and the Field. These star figures together constitute a vivid depiction of the ‘myth of the Syrian goddess’, which can be thought of as the master-myth of this season. The myth runs as follows – two fish found an enormous egg floating in the depths of the river Euphrates, the fish guided the egg up from the watery depths of the river and rolled it onto dry land, where a dove appeared and started to brood it. In due time, the Syrian goddess herself was born from the egg. On account of this myth, fish and birds were held to be particularly sacred to the Syrian goddess. The star-map indicates that the setting of this myth and its participants are not, in fact, of this earth, but are to be found in the heavens. What is of pivotal importance is the identity of the ‘river Euphrates’. Apart from the earthly river, the ‘Euphrates’ can also be found on the star-map where it is closely associated with the watery outflow joined to the Swallow. This heavenly river actually runs parallel to the course of the ecliptic (represented by the dotted line on the main map) and now that this fact is established, the action of the fish can be better understood – they escort the sun (the mythical egg) from its lowest point at the solstice and guide it onto its ascending path that leads towards the spring and ‘dry land’, which is represented on the star-map by the constellation of the Field. The myth as a whole can now be understood as an image of time that has guided us from the darkness of winter to the beginning of spring. Continuing the watery theme we next encounter the Babylonian equivalents to Capricorn and Aquarius, known as the Goatfish and the Great One. The compound nature of the Goatfish is best understood in terms of the symbolism that we have already examined. In short, I would argue that it is essentially a combination of the Stag and the Fish – the Stag representing the renewal of the sun’s power at midwinter, while the Fish acts as a guardian to the nascent sun and guides it upon the first stages of its ascending path. The watery symbolism continues in the figure known as the Great One, the Babylonian name for our Aquarius. As a seasonal symbol, the Great One with his overflowing vases symbolises the increased rains and floods of winter and early spring. Along with the constellation of the Field, which represents a plot of arable land, the Great One can be thought of as the ‘Irrigator’ – as the rising of these constellations mark the season when the ripening barley is irrigated before the springtime harvest. Although the precise location of the Swine is still a matter of debate, it is very likely that his star is to be found in the rebirth sector of the star-map as it is attributed to the god Damu, whose name can be translated as the ‘child’. Mythic texts portray Damu as one of the dying gods, closely related to Dumuzi, who vanished from the earth and was mourned by his mother and sister. Like all the dying gods he does eventually return to the earth – and true to form, myths speak of him escaping from the underworld via a river. All in all, the symbolism of the constellations that rise after the winter solstice concur in depicting a time when the sun re-emerges from the darkness of winter and starts its ascent into the heavens. Similarly, in the unfolding lifecycle of the dying god, Damu (the ‘Child’), escapes from the underworld and starts to make his way back to the upper worlds. The image of the child escaping the underworld, and of the nascent sun dwelling within the waters, can also be interpreted in human terms as the foetus dwelling within the creative waters of the womb. The multitude of images all relate one essential truth – that life, in all its myriad forms, takes shape within the creative waters.

THE GREAT ONE (Pages 121-3) The Babylonian precursor of Aquarius is known as Gula, the ‘Great One’. The constellation is generally portrayed as a standing male figure, sometimes of gigantic proportions, who holds one or more vases overflowing with streams of water. With his feet firmly set upon the earth, the gigantic figure of Gula towers above the mountaintops (right). The overflowing vases he holds aloft symbolise the fertile rains falling from heaven, and the vases set about his feet represent the watery Abyss below the earth from which freshwater wells up to feed rivers and lakes. As a seasonal star the Great One represents the increase in river levels and rainfall that occurs during the winter months. In an agricultural context he can also be understood as the ‘irrigator’ whose waters irrigate the thriving barley fields in late winter. The barley fields are, of course, represented among the stars by the adjacent constellation of the Field. To emphasise their watery nature the streams of water flowing from his vases are often embellished with the tiny images of fish (see fig 2). In fact, one of these fish appears on the Babylonian star-map as the constellation known as the Fish – it too has been transmitted to the Greek heavens as the Southern Fish (Pisces Austrinus), where it can be seen swimming along the outflow of Aquarius’ vase. In Babylonian art, waterways such as rivers and streams are conventionally depicted as a pair of wavy lines, which are thought to represent the parallel banks of a river. Recognisably the same image occurs in the cuneiform writing system as the A-sign (right). This sign by itself simply signifies ‘water’, but it is also used in numerous compounds expressing watery concepts, such as river, flood, sea and lake. The basic form of this sign has evolved into the familiar zigzag symbol used as the modern glyph for Aquarius.
Like many of the constellations that embody aquatic symbolism, the Great One is closely associated with the god of wisdom and water, known as Enki in Sumerian and Ea in Akkadian. One astrology text simply states that ‘the Great One is the Lord of springs, Ea’. In ancient art Enki is commonly depicted with overflowing vases in his hands or set around his throne dais, and sometimes he is seen seated within a square enclosure that is thought to represent the Abyss (see fig 54).
The constellation of the Great One is written ‘Mul Gu-la’
MUL GU LA The name ‘Gula’ is derived from the Sumerian word Gal, which at the simplest level means ‘great or big’. It can also signify ‘a chief, or eldest son’, and significantly it can also refer to ‘a large cup or bowl’. Even though the Gu-sign is commonly used to write ‘thread, string, flax’ it appears to depict a cup with the sign for ‘share or division’ below it. The La-sign can be used to write ‘plenty, exuberance, wealth’. On a pictorial level the combination of these the signs suggest the abundant water streams flowing from the Water-bearer’s vases.

The ultimate origins of Aquarius can be traced back to a figure often called the lahmu or ‘nude hero’. He first appears in the artwork of the early 3rd millennium where he sometimes appears in depictions of the ‘Lion-bull conflict’ (see the Bisonman for more details). These images typically portray him as a benevolent figure, protecting the herds from the attack of savage lions From 2500 BCE the nude hero starts to appear in new contexts. First, he is seen as a gatekeeper holding open stylised doors. But it is only in the Akkadian period, a couple of centuries later, that he becomes associated with the water god Enki and makes his first appearance as a water-bearer. By the start of the 2nd millennium his iconography has settled down into the familiar form of a standing man holding an overflowing vase (right). To emphasize his celestial character stars are sometimes arrayed about him.
Alongside the masculine water-bearer we also find a feminine version. Even though the symbol of the overflowing vase can be held by a wide variety of divine and semi-divine figures (see the Star of Abundance) we can be sure that the feminine form does indeed represent the Great One as her throne is sometimes placed above the Goatfish (right), and at least one entitlement stone actually labels an enthroned goddess as ‘the Great One’. There has got to be a suspicion that this feminine form is older as the ancient divine name ‘Gula’ was originally applied to goddesses. Like other ecliptic constellations that rise over the winter, the Great One has very few omens explicitly associated with it. However, the commentaries reveal that the ‘Kidney-star’ can be used as an alternative name for the Great One. Omens for the Kidney typically make predictions concerning the harvests and the nature of the coming floods, which is entirely consistent with the symbolic meaning of the Great One. As I argue in the section on the Star of Eridu, this identification probably depends on the common appearance of the two constellations as human figures holding overflowing vases.

THE TAILS (Pages 216-7)
The origins of Pisces as a pair of fish can be traced back to the Babylonian constellation called the Tails. Even the concept of the cord or ribbon that joins the two fish together can be found
in late Babylonian star-lore, where the ‘bright star of the ribbon of the Fishes’ is regarded as the
lead star of the so-called ‘Normal stars’ – a series of 32 stars located close to the ecliptic that are used as reference points for locating the planets. The cord itself is doubtless another example of a
celestial bond that often appears in Babylonian star-lore in connection with the location of the
solstices and equinoxes – the points in the solar year that are figuratively ‘fixed’ in relation to the
stars.There is every reason to believe that the idea of the cord would only have been applied to
these stars in the latter half of the 1st millennium when they came to mark the position of the spring
equinox. Before this time the two component parts of the cord would have been envisioned as the
two great rivers of Mesopotamia, the Tigris and Euphrates. The origin of the ‘knot’ that unites the
two cords represents the Shat-al-Arab where the two great rivers join together before flowing into
the Gulf of Bahrain.
This image of the two rivers is the ultimate origin of the symbolism of Pisces – as rivers are typically represented in Babylonian art as a pair of wavy lines with tiny fishes added along their
courses to further emphasise their watery nature (see fig 2). The whole image is copied from
nature as the 12th month of the year, which is marked by the rising of the Tails, is the season that
river carp swim upstream to their breeding grounds in rivers swollen by melt waters from the
mountains.
As the basic economy of Mesopotamia was founded on irrigation agriculture, the floodwaters
of the Tigris and Euphrates were essential to the ongoing prosperity of the land. The Tails can thus
be seen to form an integral part of the farming symbolism centred on the nearby constellation of
the Field. When the Tails are favourably aspected they are thought to predict good floods: ‘If the
Wild Sheep approaches the Tigris-star: there will be rain and flood’; and an abundant flood
naturally brings a plenteous harvest in its train: ‘If Jupiter stands in the Tails: the Tigris and
Euphrates will be filled with silt; there will be prosperity and abundance in the land’.
The constellation of the Tails is written ‘Mul Kun-meš’
MUL KUN MEŠ In Akkadian these signs are read as zibbātu – the ‘tail’ of an animal, the ‘tailend’ of an army. The Kun-sign depicts an animal’s tail with a tuft of hairs at the end. The
name may allude to the constellation rising in month 12, the ‘tail-end’ of the
year. This sign can also be used to write ‘canal outlet’ – a use that is probably
inspired by the astrological association of the Tails-constellation with rivers
and irrigation agriculture.
The Meš-sign simply demarks the plural; it is always placed at the end of a name.

The constellation of the Tails first appears
among the ‘stars on the path of the Moon’, a
series of 16 ecliptic constellations listed in Mul
Apin that are the Babylonian forerunner of the 12 zodiac constellations. The asterism itself
gives the impression of being a newly formed
figure specifically designed to represent the 12th
month of the year. As its full name reveals
‘the Tails of Anunitum and the Swallow’ – the Tails is really a composite constellation, made
up from the parts of other pre-existing star
figureTs.he name only becomes understandable
in light of the illustration (fig 147 above) that
superimposes the modern image of Pisces upon the corresponding Babylonian
constellations. It shows that the Piscean fish are considerably smaller than their Babylonian
counterparts – and that only the tails of the respective constellations actually correspond to each
other.See also: Anunitum and the Swallow
