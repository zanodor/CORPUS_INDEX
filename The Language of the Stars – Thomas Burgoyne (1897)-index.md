PREFACE.
In the practical application of "Celestial Dyna
mics7' the primary principles of Astronomy and
Astrology must be fully understood, and as no
really reliable practical Manual at a reasonable
price has ever been issued in America upon this
subject, combined with the fact that owing to the
United States postal and revenue laws, European
works are almost inaccessible to American readers,
who cannot afford to pay prohibitive prices.
It is to be hoped that these facts alone are a sufficient apology, if any be needed, for the ap
pearance of a work in this, the last decade of the
Nineteenth Century, professing to deal seriously
with the rules and elementary principles of Ancient
Astrology.
As a matter of fact, there is nothing in the pres
ent work that can be called original, more than is
embraced perhaps in the style and method of pre
sentment, because the matter subjected to the
reader's notice is but the Alphabet of that Science
of the Stars which gave to Chaldea its grandeur
and to Egypt its wisdom.
An Alphabet of Celestial knowledge which is
coeval with the history of man and whose origin



PBEFACE.
is lost within the depths of prehistoric time. The
writer's chief effort has been to present the subject
to the young student in the simplest form possible,
and to convey to his mind the technical details of
an exceedingly interesting study in a pleasing
manner, free from all the unseemly personalities
so frequently found in astrological authors.
At the same time the subject is treated in a
thoroughly practical manner to enable the student
to realize the extent of his undertaking.
It is vast, and requires a mind that is equally
great for its full realization. At the Fame time
it will, when once mastered, amply repay him for
the time and effort devoted to its acquirement.
Each subject has been rendered as brief and
concise as possible, and all imaginary rules and
considerations, no matter upon what authority they
rest, from Claudius Ptolemy to the present day,
have been ignored. The lover of truth, and the
Scientific investigator has little use for "The part
of Fortune," or, "Dragon's head and tail."
They want facts, and these facts mixed with as
little theory as possible. With this we close, remembering the words of a well known critic, "The Preface is an Author's opportunity to unload his
egotistical cant."
The Author. ^



THE LANGUAGE OF THE STARS,
LESSON I.
PLANETARY INFLUENCES.
That there are immutable laws in nature no man
of common sense will deny. Principles are laws.
Equally self-evident must be the fact that such
natural law is administered through some agency,,
and that such agencies or instruments, obeying the
attractive and repulsive forces dominating them,
can only transmit their powers and fulfill the be
hests of creative and evolutionary law, by means
of the sympathies and antipathies, which we find
constituting the basis of all life, growth, death
and decay. So it is with everything which has
so far been submitted to the keen investigation of
the human mind; the attraction of a sun for its
planets, for instance; of a mother to her offspring;
or of a man toward his help-mate —woman—are
based upon the same eternal principle. They con
stitute the unchangeable analogies of nature,
which we can neither ignore nor dispute.



6 THE LANGUAGE
Therefore, in this brief attempt to elucidate the
nature and source of planetary influence, we are
compelled, for want of space, to assume without
further argument, that the sun, moon and planets
are no exception to the general order of nature;
but that they have a force, power and influence,
each peculiar to itself, upon each other, upon our
earth and everything existing thereon. The fact
that the tides of the ocean are ever obedient to the
attractions of the moon in her orbit; that the gor
geous Helianthus, on the contrary, ever turns its
golden head toward the sun, are but single straws
that catch the student's eye to indicate the trend
of the great current of life.
The stars and planets are the instruments by
which the seven creative principles manifest them
selves. They influence externally by their attrac
tive sympathies and repulsive antipathies the cos
mic life forces, which, in the realm of spirit, are
controlled by their celestial rulers. By this we
mean that the various physical orbs called planets,
etc., act as so many magnetic centers. They are
magnetic by solar induction, the sun itself being
positively electric, and this mighty electrical force
acts upon the physical planet precisely as an elec
tric current acts upon a piece of soft iron.



OF THE STARS. 7
The sum total of those powers, then, which are*
termed planetary influences is contained within the
potentiality of the solar ray. But when so emitted
as a cosmic force, the action of this solar ray upon
the human organism and its material destiny is
neutral. To become potential in special directions
it is necessary to become refracted into active
attributes. This is precisely the ministerial office
of the planets. They each receive and absorb
some one principle of the solar light and reflect
such energy upon other bodies under a different
polarity. This energy so transmitted is the plan
etary influence, whose laws and results constitute
the language and science of the stars.
That sound, motion, force and color have a dis
tinct relationship is an admitted fact of science.
The different intensity of the various vibrations
produced by the mutual interaction of the planets
of our solar system are productive of different
colors, all of which are resolvable into each other
in their natural order, and all ultimately into the
pure white light from which they originally sprang.
This is seen in the grandest of all solar spectrums, the rainbow. There are seven colors, three primary and four complementary, corresponding to
the seven creative principles and the musical scale.
So, likewise, there are seven planetary forces,



8 THE LANGUAGE
known to astrologers as Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,
Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon.
Saturn absorbs the attribute which expresses
itself as coldness, hence isolation and reserve. It
is the blue ray in action.
Jupiter absorbs the attribute expressive of gen
erous warmth, hence a sanguine cheerfulness,
which corresponds to the purple ray.
Mars absorbs an energy, the polar opposite of
Saturn, which expresses itself as fiery, aggressive;
hence destruction, which is the red ray.
The Sun retains and transmits an electrical,
commanding force, which expresses dignity and
self-reliance; it is the orange ray.
Venus absorbs the attribute which expresses
itself as love and ideality- this corresponds to the yellow ray. Mercury absorbs the attribute which expresses
itself as mental energy; hence restlessness and in
vention, and is the violet ray.
The Moon absorbs our earth's influx, which is
purely negative in its action, and corresponds to the green ray.
These are the seven, and when these are com
plete in their mental actions upon the human
organism, termed planetary for convenience or
designation, and nature desires to continue her



OF THE STARS. 9
musical play, she ascends to a higher octave. Only
two bodies are at present either visible or influen
tial; they are as high as human evolution in the
present cycle has reached. These orbs are Uranus
and Neptune. The former the octave expression
of Mercury and the latter of Venus. Further de
tails will be given in succeeding lessons.

THE LANGUAGE OF THE STARS.
LESSON II.
THE SUN, MOON AND PLANETS.
In the practical application of the "Science of
the Stars," students make use of eight movable
bodies termed planets, whose names and symbols
are as follows:
Uranus. W Mars. S
Saturn. ^ O Sun. Venus. 2
Jupiter. % €> Moon. Mercury. £
As a matter of fact, however, the sun is not a
planet, bat the center around which the earth and
the rest of the planets revolve. But it is termed a
planet in astrology, simply for convenience in des
ignation. So likewise the moon. This body is,
strictly speaking, a satellite of the earth. But, as
all motions, aspects and positions in astrology are
considered in reference to the earth as a center,
the moon, so far as mankind are concerned, ap
pears to move round the zodiac each month, pass
ing through each sign, and thus receiving and



THE LANGUAGE OF THE STABS. 11
transmitting to earth the collected influx of inter
stellar force. Therefore, it is well to reroeraber
that in astrology all positions are geocentric and
are real, only as regards our mundane point of
observation. The same remarks would apply also
to the so-called real, or heliocentric positions, as
seen from the sun as a center. It is only shifting
the appearance from one point of observation to
another, thus demonstrating that nothing in matter
is real, everything depending upon the plane a
thing occupies and the standpoint from which it is
viewed. We are ever surrounded by the delusive
glamour of appearances which are only real so far
as the natural plane of appearances are concerned.
The planets are also divided into major and minor groups. The major planets are W, % H, S
The minor planets are $, $, D.
The Sun being considered neither major nor
minor, but the balance between the two. It will
be noticed at this point that the planet Neptune
(f) is omitted, the reason for this being that, so
far, nothing of a very decided character has been
demonstrated regarding his action. Investigation
is being carried on in various quarters, but so far,
the real nature of his influx upon man, upon the
physical plane, if he has any, is ki sub judice," hence



12 THE LANGUAGE
we ignore his action, in actual practice, for it can
not amount to much anyway, during the present generation. The planets are also divided into sex, as follows:
Masculine planets, 1?, 2£, 3, O.
Feminine planets, ?, D.
Uranus is sexless, or, perhaps, it would be better
to say that he is bi-sexual in his nature. The
myth of his mutilation, by his son Kronos, has a
significant meaning for those who can read between
the lines of the fable.
Mercury is convertible in nature; he is femi
nine when in aspect with Venus or the moon, and
masculine if aspected by the others. If by both
natures at the same time, he assumes the sex of
that body in closest aspect with him at the time.
Hence it is that Mercury has been called the
"interpreter" and messenger of the Gods, because
he reveals or translates the nature of those whose
rays he receives by aspect. Thus, for instance, if
Mercury, at the moment of birth, be separating
from an aspect of Mars and applying to Venus, he
would transfer the mental force, or, in other words,
translate the language of Mars into that of Venus,
and so breath forth an amorous strain.
2£, $ and the O are electric and positive in nature.



OF THE STARS. 13
*>, ? and the <D are magnetic and negative in
nature.
Uranus is positive and electro-magnetic in his
nature; while Mercury, as before stated, is either
the one or the other, according as he may be situ
ated at the time.
The specific nature of each planet, termed the
temperaments, is as follows:
Uranus is erratic, nervous, impulsive, head
strong, mystical, occult and barren, a disturbing element.
Saturn is cold, inert, nervous, secretive, selfish,
timid, persistent, laborious and barren.
Jupiter is warm, temperate, vital, jovial, gener
ous, honest, sanguine and fruitful.
Mars is fiery, bilious, active, combative, inflam
matory, cruel, s lfish, barren and destructive.
The Sun is hot, electric, majestic and commanding.
Venus is warm, moist, sanguine, loving, ambi
tious and fruitful.
The Moon is cold, watery, lymphatic, change
able, hio-hly Eaagoaliig, maternal and fruitful.
The metals, over which the foregoing planets
preside or rule, are: Uranus, aluminum; Saturn,
lead; Jupiter, tin; Mars, iron; Sun, gold* Venus,
copper; Mercury, quicksilver; Moon, silver.



14 THE LANGUAGE
Upon the human organism, the planets have
affinity with the following parts:
Uranus governs the odyllic sphere, or magnetic
aura, the astral body and the animal magnetism,
Saturn the bones, liver, spleen and the joints.
Jupiter the thighs, feet and arterial system.
Mars the external sexual organs, gall, kidneys
and muscles.
The Sun the heart, back, vital principle or life
force in man.
Venus the throat, the internal sexual organs and
the nervous system of the body.
Mercury the hands and arms, the brain and ner
vous system, the mouth and tongue.
The Moon the breasts, stomach, lymph and
fluidic system.
The trades and professions which each planet is
said to signify has led to a hopeless confusion, and
should be omitted in all useful guides for young
students; for when we are seriously informed that
Saturn may indicate the native to be a real estate
agent, a plumber, a prison warden or a grave dig
ger, we would like to know what such a native
might not be. The only safe guide is to consider
the natural trend of the planets, as follows:



OF THE STAES. 15
Uranus tends to give occult, mystical and anti
quarian ability; makes the native desire employ
ment of an uncommon nature, and where mind
can express itself.
Saturn predisposes the person to some seden
tary kind of work or profession upon the mental
plane, and if the native occupy the physical plane
of life,* it will be some laborious, ungenial trade
or work.
Jupiter predisposes to the higher walks of life,
something in which social life is blended; law,
medicine and theology are among his professions,
and that of commerce in its numerous branches.
In this line the lower planes of life give clerks,
assistants and porters, and the higher their em
ployers.
Mars, when not diverted into the army and navy,
gives all mechanical employment, wThere steel or
iron, or tools made of the same, are much used,
except agricultural work. But as to whether a
given person born under Mars will become a sur
*One of the most important factors in astrology is a knowledge of the social and mental plane in which the person lives, and to which they were born. A farm laborer nneducated, may possess finer mental abilities than his pastor or his physician, but their relative difference in plane and education enables them to exercise their various functions with a very different degree of power.



16 THE LANGUAGE
geon, soldier, an engine driver or a watchmaker,
no astrologer has as yet been able to foretell, each
being a martial employment.
The Sun predisposes to official positions, polit
ical and civil promotions; hence office-holders.
In the lower planes this influence tends to produce
servants, deputies, etc., appointed by the above.
Venus inclines to art, music, drama, vocal work,
and to light or fancy businesses, as dry goods etc.
;
also such employment as teachers, type-writers, etc.
Mercury predisposes to literature, science and
all work requiring mental effort and arithmetic,
and especially in the line of agents for commercial
firms, drummers, real estate agents, accountants,
etc., etc.
The Moon inclines the mind to some common,
retail, every-day kind of business. It may be any
thing from a nurse to a saloon-keeper, no one can say which.
Note. —The Various Medicines Ruled by the Planets.Each planet governs certain substances, certain plants and certain minerals. We have not space to tabulate these, therefore, give that which will prove most useful, viz., the medicines. We give the Latin names, such as they are known by to the medical profession and the drug store, where they can all be obtained for a mere nominal sum. Saturn rules antimonium, aconitum, agrius castus, belladonna, cannibis, sativa, colchicum, conium, daphne mezeream, graphites, helleborus niger, hyoscyamus, plumbum, rhus toxicodendron, sabadilla, veratrum and verbascum.

Co., London, England, where they will find the question of
medical astrology fully elaborated.

LESSON III.
THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC.
The Zodiac is a uniform band or belt extending
round the visible heavens, about 14° broad, and
crossing the earth's equator at an angle of 23° 28 ',
nearly. It is divided into twelve equal parts of
30° each, termed signs, though these twelve spaces
have no real connection with the real constella
tions whose names they bear; neither do the starry
constellations occupy the spaces known by their
names. There is a gradual displacement of these
constellations of about 50' per year, causing them
to appear to move backwards; but this motion,
termed the Precession of the Equinoxes (more
correct would be recession), is caused by the real
motion of our sun through space around some
greater astral center.
The signs of the Zodiac, then, are simply twelve
spaces of the Zodiacal belt, measured from the
point of the vernal equinox, called the first point



THE LANGUAGE OF THE STAES. 19
of Aries. These spaces are the twelve great divi
sions of the solar year.* These spaces are regis
ters, so to say, which measure for us the increase
and decrease of solar and planetary influence; and
the influence of the twelve signs, as we receive it,
is due to the rise and fall of solar electricity, the
lowest near the 21st of December, when the Sun
reaches the first point of Capricorn, and the high
est near the 21st of June, when the Sun reaches
the first point of Cancer; while the 21st of March
records the mean influx rising, and the 21st of
September the mean of its influx declining.
The foregoing are points to be carefully consid
ered, because upon a full comprehension of the
facts presented depends the student's realization
of the true source and nature of Celestial Dynamics.
The twelve signs of the Zodiac are thus named
and expressed:
T Aries, 1. SI Leo, 5. # Sagittarius. 9.
8 Taurus, 2. M Virgo, 6. \3 Capricorn, 10.
n Gemini. 3. =£= Libra, 7. £7 Aquarius, 11.
£d Cancer, 4. "HI Scorpio, 8. X Pisces, 12.
Commencing at Aries as No. 1, they follow each
other in the order enumerated; hence the twelve
*By solar year we mean, of course, the apparent return of the Sun to the first point of Aries annually.



20 THE LANGUAGE
signs of 30° each make up the complement of a
great circle, 12 X 30°=360°.
The foregoing signs have also the following
meaning, nature and division:
Northern Signs— T.b, n,S3, Jl, M, so called be
cause the Sun, when passing through the mannu
ally, is north of the equator.
Southern Signs— =a=, iU, t, VS, £?-, >£, so termed
becase the Sun is south of the equator when in
them.
Masculine Signs— T, n, SI, =£=,£, yflr. These
are positive in nature as compared with the rest,
which are called feminine signs, 8, £d, tijj, tti. ^3, 3£-,
It will be noticed that the positive signs are Fiery
and Airy, while the negative signs are Earthy
and Watery, as follows:
Fiery Signs— T, £l,\*.
Airy Signs— n, =£=, &?-.
Earthy Signs— b, TT£, \3.
Watery Signs—£d, m, X.
This division is termed the elementary nature
of the signs. They express the four occult ele
ments in action, and not any scientific element,
because it is self-evident that none of them are
elements in this sense; neither did the ancient
Alchemists so believe them.



OF THE STAKS. 21
The cardinal signs are T, S3, =^= and V3, because
they become the mansion of the Sun at the four
cardinal points of the year, March. June, Septem
ber and December.
The constitutional nature of the signs are considered thus:
<p , £p, =1= . \3 are movable signs.
8, SI, "ni, aw are fixed signs.
n, ftS., 4, X are common signs.
There are many other divisions of the foregoing,
but they are of little, if any, utility in actual prac
tice, and are therefore omitted. The student can
study them out for himself, if he so desires, in the
works of "Wilson," "Dr. Simmonite," "Lilly" and
kindred authors.
The signification and government of the twelve
signs over the human organism now demands attention.
Aries rules the head and face.
Taurus rules the neck and throat
Gemini rules the arms and shoulders.
Cancer rules the breast and stomach.
Leo rules the back and heart.
Virgo^rules the abdomen and intestines.
Libra rules the reins and loins.
Scorpio rules the external sexual organs and anus.



22 THE LANGUAGE OF THE STARS.
Sagittarius rules the hips and thighs.
Capricorn rules the knees.
Aquarius rules the calves and ankles.
Pisces rules the feet.
The general physiological government of the
system is as follows, in constitutional order:
°P , gp, ^=, \5. The brain, stomach, ovaries, reins,
liver and skin.
b, ft, Ti{. $?. The throat, heart, sexual organs
and blood.
n, W, t, t£. The lungs, bowels, nervous sys
tem, arms and feet.
It is advisable that the whole of the foregoing
details be committed to memory, so that in read
ing a figure of the heavens, the true significance,
nature and power of each sign will be instantly
realized.



THE LANGUAGE OF THE STARS.
LESSON IV,
THE AFFINITIES AND ANTIPATHIES OF THE SIGNS
AND PLANETS.
Iii tlie great majority of the works upon Astrol
ogy a great deal of imaginary importance is at
tached to the dignities of the planets — the domal
dignities. From Claudius Ptolemy, who collected
and formulated the best teachings of the astrology
of the ancients for the use of posterity, down to
the latest copyist of present times, the delusion of
terms, faces and exaltations have been more or
less repeated, with the noble exception, perhaps,
of "Wilson 55 and "Pearce."
That there is a natural sympathy between the
nature of a planet and the solar force of a given
sign, seems very reasonable; but that any set
number of degrees in a given sign, or that any one
special degree possesses an exaltation alone seems
absurd, and, in fact, is not warranted in actual
experience. The result of twenty-two years of



.%7
24 THE LANGUAGE
extensive Astrological practice shows the writer
most conclusively that the planets have a good
deal of influence over the signs they are supposed
to rule. That is to say, the signs in question agree
with the acknowledged lords in nature and quality
of force. Further, that each planet is stronger in
signs of his own nature than in others; and, lastly,
that a planst is weak when in signs of an opposite
nature.
The following arrangement may be relied upon
in actual practice:
Planet. Sign. Strong. Weak.

The student will notice that there is no harmo
nious system about the foregoing arrangement.
None of that "apple-pie order," as Wilson calls
Note. —My experience points to the fact that the planet Mercury may be fairly potent in any sign, everything depending upon his aspects and his position in the figure. He is always strong when in the ascendant, and tsnth, no matter what sign he occupies.



DP THE STABS. 23
Ptolemy's table of domal dignities. But I have
found it to agree with facts in nature. For in
stance, Saturn is weak in fiery signs, bat he is not
weak in Cancer. This I have proved frequently.
There is nothing of the heart or fiery will about
Saturn, hence he cannot harmonize with such
signs. He is stronger in earthy signs; they agree
with his laborious nature; and I have always been
doubtful as to Mars in Taurus. I consider that he
is not strong in this sign ; at the same time I have
not found him to be weak; he probably exerts a
normal influence here.
I have found one exception to the law, viz., in
the case of Mars and Scorpio. This sign is a fiery
watery sign; an exceedingly peculiar combination
of aqua and martial force,
A good general rule for the student to follow is
to notice the nature of a planet and consider them
powerful when in signs of a similar nature.
Thus, Saturn is strong in earthy signs.
Jupiter is strong in signs of a noble and fruitful nature.
Mars is strong in fiery signs.
Sun is strong in fiery signs,
Venus is strong in signs of a martial, fruitful nature.
Mercury is strong in airy signs.



Zb THE LANGUAGE
Moon is strong in watery signs.
Thus it will be seen that Saturn, Mars, Mercury
and the Moon represent the four triplicities; while
Jupiter, Sun and Venus represent the noble, ma
jestic, paternal ideal, loving and fruitful elements,
which complete the organism; and such we find
them in actual life.
The planet Uranus agrees in nature with w
more than any other sign, i. e., scientific, unstable
and airy, which is undoubtedly the quality of W
The planet Neptune, so far as I have been able
to find out, gives very beneficial rays when in 3£,
but the reverse in T, and therefore }£ is a natural
sign for f, so it seems to me.
And, lastly, it has been asserted that when a
planet is strong, such a position increases its pow
ers for good and diminishes its force for evil. This
I have never been able to verify; on the contrary,
I have found that the question of good or evil
depends entirely upon the aspects at time of birth.
If Saturn is weak in the nativity, his powers for good or evil are correspondingly weak; if strong, he is powerful for good or evil, according to aspect,
as the case may be. It is a radical mistake to think that Saturn and Mars are the authors of every misfortune and Jupiter or Venus the parents
of every blessing. If Saturn is strong at birth



OF THE STARS. 2?
and well aspected, lie produces lasting good by
position and direction. His good arcs will produce
permanent benefit, while his evil arcs will only
bring temporary evil. On the contrary, if he is
powerful in a natus and much afflicted, the exact
reverse will be true; and the same remarks apply
to other planets.
The following ingenious diagram, which has
been given in several treatises, will be found use^

LESSON V.
THE ASPECTS AND THEIE NATURE.
The astronomical aspects are certain angular
distances, continually being formed between the
Sun, Moon and planets, by their motion through
the Zodiac. Those made use of in Astrology are
tne aspects formed between the same bodies in
reference to the earth as the central point of
observation. Consequently the geocentric longi
tudes only are taken into account when calculating
their distances; in other words, their apparent
positions in the Zodiac, as seen from the earth.
These geocentric positions are given for every day
at noon in an astronomical Ephemeris,* calculated
to the meridan of Greenwich, England.
The only aspects considered of importance in
Astrology are the following:
"^Raphael's ani Zadkiel's Ephemeris are the best, and are published annually; either one will do.



THE LANGUAGE OF THE STARS. 29
Conjunction Semi-Square,, Sextile, Square,
6 L or n >k '
Trine, Sesquiquadrate, Opposition, Parallel, A
- £ or ssp 8 Par.
The conjunction, 6 transpires when two or more
planets have the same longitude. '
The semi-square, L (sometimes noted thus, sq),.
when they are 45° apart or one sign and a half;
thus, if O, for instance, be 2° 30 ' of n, it would
be in semi-square to another planet in or near 33
17° 30', or in 17° 30' of °P, as they measure either
backwards or forwards in the Zodiac.
The sextile % is when two or more bodies are
two signs, or 60°, apart; the O, for instance, in 33
5° 0', is sextile to » 5° 0', and m 5° 0\
The square is when planets are three signs,
or 90°, apart; as, for instance, °P is to 33 and \3.
The trine A is when two or more bodies are
120°, or four signs, apart; T is A to SI and f.
The sesquiquadrate E (sometimes noted thus,
ssd), are when planets are 135° apart, or four signs
and a half apart. It is a square and semi-square
added together; for instance, a planet in b 12° 30'
is in n to another near 27° 30 ' of M, or in f
27° 30',- as from f 27° 30' to « 12° 30' is exactly
135° of longitude.



30 THE LANGUAGE
The opposition 8 is when two or more bodies
occupy opposite points of the Zodiac, as T in 5 to
=^=, etc.
The parallel, Par. (generally noted simply P.),
is when two or more planets have the same degree
of declination, north or south of the celestial equa
tar; this is given daily for the Sun and Moon and
every third day for the planets, in the best Ephe
meris. It matters not whether it be -N". or S. ; for
instance, with 4° 30 ', N. dec. would be in Par.
with any other body in 4° 30' dec, either north
or south.
There are other aspects, such as the semi-sextile,
the decile and quintile, but they are too feeble in
force to deserve notice, and in practice we ignore
them entirely.
The nature of the aspects in power and effect
are as follows: [

U
The L, , n and § of any planet is evil; the L
and y are equal in power; then comes the square,
which is-much more powerful, and lastly the ft.
which is the most powerful of all evil aspects.
The- % and A are benefic, 4:he A being much
more potential for good than the %
.
The conjunction 6 and Par. of 2f and $ are pow
erful for good; but the same. aspects formed by W,
T? and f> are evil.



OF THE STARS. 31
The aspect of the Sun and Moon are good or evil,
according to the nature of the aspect. The same
remarks will apply to Mercury, who, as before
stated, is changeable.
A perfect familiarity with all the foregoing
details and the ability to quickly ascertain the
aspect in operation at a given moment, is an in
dispensible qualification for the practice of Astrol
ogy. Therefore, all intending practitioners must
accustom themselves by practice to the nature of
planetary motion and the correct measurement of
longitude at a glance. Especially to note whether
the aspects are forming or separating, and this is
known very easily, thus: Suppose the © be in 9°
n and Saturn be 7° Si-, the © is separating from
the % of ^. It is nearly 58° from the 6, or 2° past
the perfect % . But, suppose ^ be in 16° of £1, then
the © would be applying to the % , as the distance
between the two bodies would be 67°. The same
remarks will, of course, apply to other bodies and
all the aspects. The orb of operation is given by all sensible and | j
practical Astrologers as 5° ail around. But the j various books give various orbs from 8° to 17°
according to the planet. But, in these cases, it
often happens that the planets can be in both good
and evil aspects at the same time. . For instance



32 THE LANGUAGE OF THE STARS.
in Raphael's i Guide to Astrology," Vol. 1, page 5,
we learn that the orb of the O is 17°, and that of
the © 12°; add these together and we have 29° of
longitude, half of which is 14° 30 ', the orb of oper
ation. Let us apply such a ridiculous system.
Suppose in a given natus the Sun bd in T 10° and
the Moon in n 2° 30' ; they are 52° 30' apart, and,
according to the system taught in our lessons, are
not in any aspect at all, being beyond the 5° limit
of a L and short of the 5° limit of a *, But ac
cording to Raphael's "guide," they were in both L
and % at the same time, being only 7° 30' from
either aspect; and, as Raphael's limit is 14° 30' in
this case, they could be considered as in powerful
operation for good or for evil, just as it suited the
Astrologer's desire or 6ms or his judgment. And
the same thing could take place between the semisextile (which Raphael uses) and the L Also be
tween the A and the p , as there is only 15° difference between them. Our limit is 5°, and any limit which exceeds or is short of completion more than 5°, we consider as void of any aspect whatever. Thus, a planet in T 5° 7' would not be in aspect to another in n 11°, because it is 6° beyond the %, or 1° more than the orb of operation, etc. Just so, a planet in 2° of n would be considered in #, because only 3° from the perfect aspect, or 2° within the limit.

LESSON VL
THE NATURE, QUALITY AND GENERAL INFLUENCE
OF THE PLANETS,
The student must ever bear in mind that the in
fluences and qualities herein described are only
manifested upon the human organism, under cer
tain conditions, viz.:
a When rising in the ascendant at birth, or
b When lord of the ascending sign, there being
no planet therein to alter such influx, and at the
same time being oriental and in some aspect with
the Moon or Mercury, or both; and lastly,
c When situated in the M. C, in strong aspect
to the Moon or Mercury, or both. In any of these
positions a planet will exert its peculiar forces in
such degree as to manifest them clearly in the
person born.
In actual practice, it will often be found that a
person is born with none of the foregoing positions
to apply, i. e., the ascendant void of planets; ditto



Bi ?H£ LANGUAGE
the M. C, and at the same time the lord of the arc,
having no aspect to the rulers of the mind, i. e. 4
Mercury and the Moon. In this case the plane^
tary influences are latent in the person; such an
one will manifest very small individuality, and his
physical and mental temperament will be clearly
described by combining the influence and nature of
the ascending sign with that of the Moon and the
sign she occupies, together with the cosmic or
solar polarity of the month. With these consider
ations to qualify our statements, we proceed.
Uranus gives a tall, upright stature, with much
expression in the features, grey eyes and usually
brown hair. He denotes a sharp, penetrative^
eccentric person, full of curiosity; that is to say,
very inquisitive, far from fortunate, always abrupt
and changeable in manner, and inclined to be
"cranky" in his ideas.
When well dignified at birth, he gives sudden
and unlooked-for changes in life and habitation of
a beneficial nature, and produces many pleasing
surprises. Such a nature is full of novel ideas and
inventions. When ill dignified he causes strange and sudden
sorrow, losses and other calamities, makes the native unfortunate and liable to misfortune from
public bodies (corporations).



OF THE STARS. 35
Saturn produces a form above medium height,
of a sallow complexion and down-cast look, dark
hair and eyes, thin beard; and somewhat lean or
spare organism with strong bones. Such people
nre selfish, with magnificent mental qualities.
Their perceptive and reflective organs are always
well developed,
When well dignified, Saturn gives a profound
imagination a cold, passionless nature, severe in
manner and reserved, hence of very few w^ords, but
these few are always incisive and to the point.
Such a nature is very sparing in his charity, and
studious and patient in acquiring the goods of this
life. He makes a firm and true friend and a most
firm and unrelenting foe^
When ill dignified, he is envious, covetous, sus
picious, a miser, timid, a liar and thoroughly dis
honest. Such a person is always a sham and a
fraud. He will pretend or profess all manner of
things outwardly to gain his selfish ends. He is
never contented, always on the murmur against
fate or Providence, and, no matter what he attempts
for the benefit of others, he has always some base,
ulterior motive which spurs him on to action.
Jupiter yields an upright, tall stature, brown
hair and ruddy complexion (healthy looking), oval
face, with full and ample body; in fact, one with a



86 THE LANGUAGE
generous and stately build; a large and well bal
anced head, with benevolence, veneration and con
scientiousness large. They have usually large
grey or hazel eyes.
When well dignified, the nature is truly mag
nanimous, faithful, honest in his dealings, and
aspiring to aid in all true philanthropic move
ments. He is religious, and somewhat orthodox in
views, but possessing much charity and tolerance
for the views of others; such an one is always
charitable, liberal, affectionate, and a defender of
rightful causes of the poor and destitute. He
makes a noble, generous friend and a merciful
opponent.
When ill dignified, he produces the opposite of
the foregoing; having an ample presence and good
looks, he imposes upon others. He pretends to all
the laudable qualities of Jupiter, but possesses
them not. His religion is pure cant; his honesty
lasts only until he can find a favorable opportunity
to steal or swindle. He indulges in low company
and delights in wanton, licentious habits. Such a
person creates more harm and does more damage
in a lifetime than any two openly lawless villians
could accomplish in double the time. They de
stroy one's faith in human goodness.



6$ THE STARS. S7
Mars denotes a well-set, rather spare but mus
cular organism, medium height, ruddy (sunburnt)
complexion, sharp, piercing eyes, with a red tinge
to the hair, a good well-balanced head, with com
bativeness, construction and destruction large.
When well dignified, he yields forth a fearless
person, one who is imperious, violent tempered
and exceedingly combative. He delights in war
and contention, is always fighting against some
thing or somebody. But, apart from this quarrel
some temperament, he is, in other matters, noble,
generous, rational, high-minded, honorable and, to
his friends, truly generous, but of thoroughly cruel
predisposition.
When ill dignified, the person so ruled is desti
tute of even the small list of martial virtues; he is
a thief and liar wholly given up to his passions and
vices. Such people make splendid cut-throats,
pirates and brigands, because they are destitute of
either moral tone or conscientiousness.
The Sun produces a rich mellow complexion, a
round face, a good stature, finely and amply pro
portioned— one possessing a noble, commanding
appearance. They generally go bald very early in
life (so, in fact, do persons under Jupiter). They
have large eyes, are slow and very dignified in



do THE LANGUAGE
their speech and actions, which gives them a
greater noblene s of presence.
When well dignified, the disposition of the
native is perfect; they are magnanimous, lofty
minded, grand in their ideas and conceptions, am
bitious and aspiring; they are natural born leaders
of their kind, make sincere friends and conscien
tious foes.
When ill dignified, the person thus born is a
proud, mean, ill natured tyrant, a restless, vain
boaster, a politician of the wire-pulling order, a
persistent office-seeker, a time-server, and one who
is despotic to those under his rule, but thoroughly
double-faced and submissive to tnose above him.
Venus produces a fine, round face, full, ruddy
lips and sparkling eyes, a beautifully moulded
form a little under medium height. They possess
a shy yet smiling countenance, with a sweet voice
and general appearance which produces amorous attractions.
Special Note. —In a very wide Astrological,, experience, I have found that, in a very great majority of cases, those who consult Astrologers have Venus semi- square to the Sun at birth; and oth^r professors have verified my observations in their experience, so that I now lay this rule down as an axiom, viz. : When Venus is in semi-square to the Sun at birth, she produces a natural predisposition to Astrology and a mystic
curiosity to penetrate the veil of the future.—T. H. B.



OP THE STARS, 39
When well dignified, the native possess a saucy
but mirthful temper; they are graceful and affec
tionate, excelliug in all the artistic accomplish
ments—art, music, dancing, etc, and are very lovely persons.
When ill dignified, they are weak-natured, amor
ous, lack moral bias, and are easily led astray and
lose their virtue. But they are not vicious, as so
many authors have stated. The faults of Venns
when ill dignified are simply dne to a iveak will
and sensitive love nature, and their consequent
fall or vices are simply due to the influence of
other more powerful vicious minds over them
than from any inherent depravity of their own.
Mercury gives the native a spare body, medium
height, a pale and rather sallow complexion, long
face, high forehead, magnificent intellect, dark
eyes and thin nose and lips. The hair is dark and
the native has long fingers and slender-looking
hands. When well dignified, he produces a keen intel
lect and large penetration. He yields all that is
combined within the mental and intellectual qual
ities of a man. Such a person excels in literature
and art. He is equally proficient in mathematics
and philosophy. He makes an accomplished sci
entist, teacher or author, and always distinguishes



40 THE LANGUAGE
himself by the vast superiority of his intellect
over the brains of the average man, Such persons
are restless and ever unweary in their thirst for
knowledge; they are witty and quick as lightning
to see the weak points and failings in others,
Their temper is volatile and their nature inconstant, When ill dignified, they are dangerous persons
to interfere with: they are unscrupulous liars, yet
they possess splendid mental qualities of a literary
and commercial nature, but often turn their abili
ties to a very questionable purpose.
The Moon generally produces a clear but pale
complexion, brown hair, grey eyes, short arms and
rather fleshy organism, of indifferent stature and
porportions.
When well dignified, the Moon gives the native
a sound healthy brain, good intellect, and a quiet,
courteous disposition. The native is fond of curi
osities of mechanical novelties, often removes his
dwelling, and cares infinitely more for the present
than for the future. Such a person loves peace and
harmony and the quiet enjoyment of social life,
He possesses a variety of gifts and is strongly
mediumistic.
When ill dignified, she produces liability to
some derangement of the brain, inclines the native



OF THE STARS. 41
to a rambling life with no end in view. Such peo
ple are purely idle characters, inclined to petty
thieving, and are always awfully tired upon the
appearance of any hard work. In fact they are
born tired, and they never get fully rested.

LESSON VII.
THE NATURE AND QUALITY OF THE SIGNS.
*
The signs of the Zodiac, when rising upon the
horizon at birth, have each a specific nature and
quality, which indelibly impresses its influx upon
the person born, especially so when there are no
planets therein to interfere with its psychological
action; should, however, one or more planets hap
pen to be located in the rising sign, their specific
nature must be commingled and a judicious com
bination made in forming an opinion.
T. Produces a spare but strong body of me
dium height, long face and bushy eyebrows, brown
hair, rather long neck, good chest and somewhat
swarthy complexion. In disposition, courageous,
ambitious, intrepid and despotic, and passionate
temper, a rather quarrelsome nature; they will
never really submit to the control of any one.

£e. Produces a medium stature, somewhat
fleshy, and the upper part larger than the lower,
a rather small, round face and pale complexion,
brown hair and pensive grey eyes; in disposition
timid, thoughtful and agreeable; the temper is
mild and under good control. Their chief quali
ties are sensitiveness and reflection, hence they
make fine mediums.
CI. Gives a large, prepossessing stature, broad
shoulders, large, prominent eyes, oval face, ruddy
complexion and light or golden hair; in disposi
tion high-spirited, resolute, haughty and ambi
tious; they are very impulsive and have strong

fine, clear complexion; in disposition noble, ami
able, high-minded and affectionate, bat hasty tern*

Y3. Generally produces a mean stature, usually
below the medium height, spare of form and plain
looking; the complexion is dark and sallow, with
dark brown or black hair and eyes; frequently
they have a sharp chin and slender nose, with

robust and well proportioned persons, with good
clear complexions and sandy or dark flaxen hair,
very prepossessing appearance; in disposition ele

found this sign to give fine dark eyes and dark
hair, combined with a beautiful clear complexion.

ings, j have noticed that when ^ is rising with °P intercepted in the first house and any planet therein, that the nature is wonderfully altered; they are then active, dignified, genial and much respected.
Note. —The foregoing general descriptions are only applicable when there are no planets therein at birth; if one or more planets occupy the rising sign, their special nature must be judiciously commingled with that of the sign. I must caution the student against placing too much reliance upon the form and complexion given in these signs (though the disposition Will always apply), for this reason'. Certain races and families are naturally dark or naturally iight complexioned. Ho sign rising at birth could give a dark complexion to the true offspring of the blue-eyed^ flaxen-haired S txon; he would simply be dark complexioned by comparison only With his race. Just so With the Italian* no sign would confer light hair or blue eyes; therefore, always bear these facts in mind, for While the signs impress their influence in some degree, they will not cause the leopard to lose his spots nor the Ethiopian to change his skin.

THE TWELVE HOUSES OF THE OHAKT OF BIRT3.
The twelve houses, or mansionsj as they are
termed, are twelve divisions of space, each division
representing two hours motion of the earth on its
axis, 12 X 2 = 24 hours of the natural day. This
arrangement has been found to represent with suf
ficient exactness, the increase and decrease of the
cosmic forces, as manifested upon any particular
section of the earth's surface.
The visible space from the eastern horizon to
the western ? is divided into six equal divisions of
an arc the meridian forming the center, or vertical
line, the east and west the horizontal, The spaed
below the horizon is divided exactly the same, the
lower meridian, or the point occupied by the sun
at midnight is of course opposite to noon; these
spaces although equally dividing the arc of day*
light and darkness, do not of course equally divide
the zodiac except exactly on the equator, and ccm

equator, nearly all figures or charts of birth will
have the various signs unequally divided.

instance, in some charts, one whole sign will be
found intercepted between two houses, or rather,
in the center of some house. They are numbered

LESSON IX.
HOW TO CALCULATE A CHART OF BIRTH.
To "cast" a horoscope of a person's nativity, the
first proceeding is to compute a celestial figure or
chart of the heavens for the exact moment of their
physical birth. This process is a very simple one
to any student at all familiar with th£ science of
practical Astronomy, if the following rules are
followed out:
I. Observe what is the right ascension on the
meridian for the given day at mean noon, which
is its true distance measured in sidereal time, from
the first point of Ari<rS.*
II. If the given time of birth is before mean
noon, subtract the said difference from the ^side
real time" at mean noon, but if it be after noon,
then add the difference to the sidereal time and
*This is given daily in any good Astro Ephemeris. ZadkieTs is a good one.



THE LANGUAGE OE THE STAB^. 53
the result will be the true right ascension of the
meridian in time for the moment of birth.
Example of the above rule: required the right
ascension of the mid-heaven for 9:45 A. M., Sep
tember 3, 1888. The sidereal time at noon on
September 3rd is 10 hours 52 minutes and 12 sec
onds, and 9:45 a. m. is 2 hours and 15 minutes
before noon; then we sav: lOh, 52' 12' ' subtract 2 15 and consequently we find that 8h. 37' 12' ' is there
suit, or, in other words, the IL Ar-required. Had
the time required been afternoon, say 3h. 27 ' P. M.,
then we should say that lOh. 52 f 12''
' +3h. 27' =
14h, 19' 12" , or the E. A. required.
III. With a "table of houses" for the latitude
of the place for which the chart is calculated, find
the nearest minute in the column of sidereal time
to the right ascension required, then in the first
column marked 10 at the head enter the sign and
degree found upon the cusp of the 10th house,
par all 1 with this in the second column marked
11, enter the sign and degree upon the cusp of the
11th house, on the same line under the third col
umn marked 12 enter the sign and degree upon
the cusp of the 12th house; upon the next column
marked "ascendant" enter the degree and minute
of the sign shown which will be the actual por



54 THE LANGUAGE
tion of the heavens rising at the moment of birth
upon the cusp of the first house, or eastern hori
zon; then follow out the same rule by entering the
signs and degrees shown in the respective columns
upon the 2d and 3d houses, this will give one-half
of the entire Zodiac.
IV. Nest place upon the opposite cusps of the
houses the same number of degrees of the opposite
signs, which will complete this, the first portion of
the celestial figure.
V. The signs and their opposites are as follows please note: cp is opposite =*=
H " " .±
£r is opposite \5 Q
ii *t AW
VI. Now carefully calculate by the rules of pro
portion the exact position in the Zodiac of the
Sun, 3ioon and planets; if the figure is for the
afternoon, add their proportion of motion to their
places at mean noon in the Ephemeris. and vice
versa, subtracting if it is before noon; this should
be done on a separate slip of paper, as sometimes
there is more than one planet in the same sign,
VII. Now carefully insert each planet in the
house and sign wherein it should be, always remembering that the commencement of each sign
is located in the house in advance; thus, if 9° T



OF THE STARS. 00
be on the ascendant, it naturally follows that 8°
of this sign are rising into the 12th house; hence
any planet located in anything less than f 9°
would be so situated, or, in other words, above the
ascendant; then, again if 13° HI be upon the cusp
of the 6th, it shows that 12° of this sign are away
down in the oth, and any planet must, of course, be
so placed. These two illustrations will answer for
the whole; remember the signs move contrary to
the number of the houses; instead of from 1 to 2,
they move from 1 to 12, then 11, 10, 9 and so on
round again to Xo. 1.
The whole of the chart is now complete, and for
special computation it only requires the declina
tions north or south of the Sun, Moon and planets
working out by proportion; in the Ephemeris they
are given for every third day.
In order to illustrate the whole of the above
seven rules, we will now work out a celestial figure
in detail.
Example 1. Required a chart of the heavens for
the birth of a child born April 3, 1888, in Denver,
Colo., U. S. A., at 11 a. M. The longitude is about
105° W,; la'itude about 40° 0' K*

time of birth is at 11 A. M., or one hour previous
to mean noon, and as we cannot very well deduct
60' from 50', we must add the whole circle, or
twenty-four hours, when the calculation stands, in

difference in the ascendant, but 5 W will.) The
nearest sidereal time to 23H 50 ' 9' ' will be found
to be 23h 49' 0' ', a difference of only one minute

for our present purpose.* Under the first column

house is opposite the 10th, so we place 27° of W,
because M is opposite pi ; the 7th is opposite the
ascendant, so we insert \5 16° 41 ', the opposite
sign to £3, and. so on^with the rest.
The student will notice that the sign of SI occu
pies the cusp of two houses, and that its opposite,
#?, does the same, while in the center of the 10th
°P appears "intercepted." This frequently trans
pires in all latitudes north and south of the equa
tor, owing to the fact that the Zodiac rises in an
oblique manner. The greater the latitude, the more
oblique the celestial arc becomes. Upon the equa
tor this is not so, but the same number of degrees
occupy each house of the chart. The student can
always see which sign is intercepted by running
over the signs and noting where the missing one
comes in, if such there be. But to resume. Our

figure is now complete so far as the houses and
signs are concerned. The intercepted sign, T, is
duly inserted in the center of the 10th house,
while its opposite, =a=, is so placed in the center of
the 4th. We are now ready for the planets.
''The planets," as all celestial movable bodies
are termed in Astrology, are simply reduced by
proportion. An example of the Sun and Moon
will suffice for the whole, as the process is virtu
ally the same for both their longitude and de
clination.
On April 2nd, in Zadkiel's Ephemeris, the Sun's
place is given at noon at Greenwich T 13° 10 '
(the seconds are discarded). On April" 3 it is s~P
14° 9'; then 14° 9
13° 10 difference is 59', which shows
the Sun's motion in twenty-four hours. The dif
ference in time is seven hours between Greenwich
and Denver, the time of birth is 11 A. M.; add this
seven hours, and it will show you that when it is
11 A. M. at the place of this horoscope, it is 6 p. M.
at Greenwich, in England; the Sun, Moon and
planets then must be calculated for 6 p. m.
This is one thing the student must carefully note, #
viz., that the signs of the Zodiac are computed for *
local time and the planets for Greenwich time, for >



60 THE LANGUAGE
this reason: It is the position of the heavens ice
note; when it is noon the Sun is on the zenith, no
matter where the place is, outside the Arctic re
gions; remember this.
The Sun's motion being 59 ', we say as 24 hours
are to 59 minutes, so are six hours (6 p. m.) to
14' 45
'
\ which is 15', near enough for our pur
pose. We then add this 15' to the Sun's place at
noon on April 3rd, 14° 9 r 15
i
14° 24' of T, the true longitude
at the time of this supposed birth. Then, in suc
cession, we take each planet, commencing with IJt
and terminating with $, and subject them to the
same proportional calculation, marking them down
upon a separate slip of paper; then we take the
Moon, which, on account of her great motion, we
work out by "diurnal, proportional logarithms."
The student may use simple proportion or the
"rule of three," if he desires, and as shown in the
example of the Sun, but logarithms are by far the
most expeditious.

trated in the following diagram. The advantage
of marking all planets upon a separate slip of
paper before inserting them in the chart is, that
we can then see how much space we have in the
respective houses for our figures, and can mark
them accordingly.

LESSON X.
HOW TO FOEM A GENEEAL JUDGMENT.
Having calculated your chart for the estimate
time of birch,* carefully calculate the aspects that
may exist between the Sun, Moon and planets, as
taught in a previous lesson. Then observe if any
of: them possess the same degree of declination
(given every third day in the Ephemeris). If
such is the case, note this down also, and consider
the influence as a conjunction; having done all
this and noted the sex of the child, proceed as
follows:
^Sometimes it .will happen that the last one or two de^ grees of a sign, or the first one or two, will be rising at the estimate time of birth. When this is the case^ note the description that the last part of one sign and also the first part of the next one will produce; then inquire which sign comes the nearest to being correct, and use that; the reason for this is, birth is not always observed with the exactness it should be, and in these cases ten minutes will sometimes make quite a difference.



46 THE LANGUAGE
I. Gauge the vitality and life force of the
native, and in doing so pay no attention to any
thing but the Sun, Moon and Ascendant and the
planets that form aspects thereto; afflicting planets
show the liability and the nature of disease.
II. Having satisfactorily determined the ques
tion of vitality, according to the rules given for
this, proceed to gauge the temperament and dispo
sition; and in doing this pay no attention to any
thing but the Moon, the Ascendant and the planets
therein; if there are no planets in the Ascendant,
pay particular attention to the planets forming
aspects to the ascending degree and the Moon.
III. After the temperament, etc., is deter
mined, proceed to carefully weigh the mental
qualities, and in this, first of all. note the positions
of the Sun, Moon and Mercury, and then the plan
ets aspecting them, especially the aspect to Mer
cury and the Moon, for these are the chief rulers
of the mind.
IV. Then commence to define the native's
financial prospects, paying particular attention to
the luminaries and their aspects, especially to each
other and the 10th house and the ruler thereof.
Any planet in the 10th has potential power in all
the native's professional and business transactions.



Or THE STARS. 65
V. After this is arranged, proceed with the
business qualifications, and, in so doing, bear the
following points in mind, viz., the temperament,
the mental abilities and the financial prospects;
all these combined constitute the true indications
of the business for which the native is best suited,
both for mental adaptability and financial success,
VI. After all the foregoing is performed, we
take a new departure, and inquire as to the matri
monial prospects of the native. In this pay abso
lute attention to the Moon, Venus and the lord of
the 7th, or any planet in the 7th, for a man; if a
woman is the subject, substitute the Sun for the
Moon.
VII. Then proceed to finish the horoscope by
judgment upon friends and enemies, journeys and
offspring, completing the whole with an analysis
of the natural predisposition to accidents, sickness
and disease, complete rules for which are given in
the following lessons.
Thus the young student will perceive that Astrol
ogy may be simplified, and the awful, mysterious
looking chart reduced to a very methodical plan,
by those who will only pay sufficient attention to
understand the rudiments. The great mistake
which the young beginners always make is in look

ing at the calculations en masse, instead of at the
special aspects thereof, which relate to the subject
of inquiry.
Some practice, of course, is necessary to become
familiar with these readings, but, after the various
rudiments are thoroughly committed to memory,
the pleasure of being able to lift the mysterious
curtain of destiny, and of reading the laws of na
ture thus revealed, will repay the student a hun
dred fold for his time and labor bestowed besides
the pleasure of thus being able to do good to others
with that kind of scientific advice which only the
Astrologer can possess

LESSON XL
'THE VITAL FORCE TEMPERAMENT AND DISPOSITION,
The Vital Force. —If the child be a male and
the Sun be above the horizon, this orb rules the
vital spark; but if the Sun be below the horizon
and the Moon be above, the Sun and Moon com
bined rule the life force; but if neither the Sun
nor Moon be above the horizon at the time of birth 5
then the Ascendant dnd the Sun become the
Rulers of life.
If the child be a female, substitute the Moon
for the Sun, and the giver of life will be founds
thus, whenever the Moon is above the horizon in
«, female natus> that Moon tules the life forces
When this is not so and the Sun be abtrve, it is the
Sun and Moon combined, and when neither a^e
thus situated, it is the Moon and the Ascendant
conjointly,



68 THE LANGUAGE
And now note, if the rulers of life are strong by
being in signs of their own nature, or well aspected
especially by Jupiter, Venus and Mars, the child
will have a fair length of life, and with care may
reach old age: when the giver of life is oriental,
i. e., between the 4th and 10th on the eastern side
of the chart, it is so much the better; also, those
born between March and June have greater vitality
under the same conditions than any others; the
weakest being from between September and Jan
uary.
If the aspects are conflicting, some good and
some bad, the vitality will be somewhat impaired,
and consequent liability to sickness; when this is
the case, always look well to the rising sign; if this
be a strong sign, such as °p , SI, f, b, iU; the child
will outlive these and may enjoy fair health; if the
sign rising is unafflicted, the stronger the Ascend
ant is, in all cases, the stronger will be the phys
ical constitution. The very best conditions are
the Sun above the horizon in Aries, the Moon in
creasing in light in Cancer, and past the of 0,
and both well aspected by Jupiter and Mars; such
a man with T rising will live past the allotted
threescore years and ten and enjoy a vigorous old
age, if discreet in his youth.



W Me stars. 69
In a male natus all aspects of Mars to the Sun,
either good or bad, are beneficial, because they in
crease the heat, which is life," unless Mars is
afflicted by § or 3Jt, when such aspects, as L, , &
and 8 ate dangerous, being productive of dangerous accidents, etc.
When the rulers of life are seriously afflicted,
the Moon by Mars and the Sun by Saturn, and one
of them being the lord of the 8th, and at the same
time the Ascendant being weak or afflicted, and
no help from Jupiter or Venus^ the child then born
will soon die. It will not survive its infancy,
which we reckon at four years, the period of the
Moon. In most cases, with such affliction, the
child dies inside of twelve months, but there is no
certain rule to say token death wiU transpire. Re*»
garding death in infancy, ''Ptolemy," the father of
modern Astrology, says; " If one of the luminaries
be angular,* and either be joined to a malific, oi%
if the latter be sitiaated at an equal longitudinal
distance from each luminary, so as to form an
equilateral triangle with them, and no benefic
aspecting them at the time, and the rulers of the
luminaries be in malific places, the child then born
will not be reared, but will shortly die."
*The four cardinal houses, 1st, 10th, 7th, 4th, are called Tingles, and a planet therein is called angular and powerful.



TO THE LANGUAGE
This rule is almost infallible, and deserves the
student's attention: In all cases where the Moon
is seriously afflicted, the constitution and general
health suffers, and this is especiaHy^j^ with a
female. When Mars is the disturbing element in
such a natus, thej^periods ^ are both irregular and
painful, with consequent suffering; and, lastly,
note whether the rulers of life be applying or sep
arating; if the former, the danger increases; if the
latter, there is hope of life and recovery.
The Tempekament and Disposition.—Carefully
weigh the influence of the rising sign, as given in
previous lessons, with the planets therein, if there
be any; then note the position of the Moon; a
judicious admixture of their influences will give
the correct result. Fiery signs give a combative,
overbearing nature; airy signs an impulsive, vola
tile, inconstant nature; earthy signs give a cau
tious, reserved, laborious, patient nature; while
watery signs give a quiet ; reflective, passive nature.
When the Moon is increasing in light, the natural
abilities of the person will appear on the surface
and become external in their characteristics; but,
when the Moon has passed the opposition, and is
decreasing in light, then the natural abilities are
more hidden or latent,. and do not appear visible;



OF THE STARS. 71
it takes a long acquaintance with such persons to
thoroughly understand them.
For the student's benefit, we will now briefly
apply the rules we have given in the lesson to the
child's horoscope, given in Lesson IX, which we
will suppose to be a male.
Firstly, then, as to the vital force. The Sun,
being above the horizon, is, in this case, the true
giver of life alone. The Sun is very strong by
sign and position, and this means a great deal; at
the same time the Sun is in to the -1 ; this will
produce some discord between the life force and
the organism. The Sun is also L to ?, but this
amounts to nothing in a question of vitality We
next observe that the Sun is both in 8 and Par. to W ;
this will not, in this case, seriously interfere with
the vitality, because the Sun has also the Par, of ? s
who is in a sign of her own nature and strong near
the meridian. The worst feature in this horo
scope for health is *? Ij*_ in the rising sign, with
both the Sun and Moon applying to a ; so that,
all things considered, we say that the vital current
is strong, but with serious danger from sickness,
indicated by 8 ¥, n d , and the approaching of *>.

It will be noted that, while the vitality of this
native is strong, the constitution is below the aver-"
age; £3 is a weak sign,, and T/ $ therein makes it
much weaker.

THE LANGUAGE OF THE STARS.
LESSON XIII.
tHE MENTAL QUALITIES AND FINANCIAL
PROSPECTS.
The Mental Qualities—The native's mental
qualities are derived chiefly from the Sun. Moori
and Mercury. The Sun rules the brain primarily.
Mercury, by his position and aspects, shows the
native's qualities of the mental force, the grade, so
to say; while the Moon gives direction to them
upon the physical plane whenever she happens to
be in aspect with either ©, or §', or both. The
Sun in fiery signs gives the brain a royal, impe
rious, commanding basis or bias.: In airy signs it
receives an aspiring, ideal, romantic bias. In
earthy signs a commercial, practical, utilitarian
/bias; while in the watery signs it receives a nega
I tive, dreamy and metaphysical bias, Thus when
we find the Sun and Moon in the same triplicity,
it produces a very strong predisposition towards
one of the foregoing tendencies, and only wants



7-i THE LANGUAGE
the assistance of Mercury and the ascendant to
produce one of two things, a genius or a crank.
When Mercury and the Moon are in a pect, the
mental qualities are strong and permanent, unless
both Sun and Moon are seriously afflicted; then
there is danger of insanity. If these aspects of
(§ and £ are benefic, the mind is genial and
kindly disposed; if malefic, it becomes sarcastic
and bitter. Aspects of Mars to Mercury, if bene
fic, make the mind pushing and energetic, critical,
inventive and combative. W gives much inventive
ability and mathematics. *? gives large reflection,
causation, comparison and melancholy, and causes
the native to be selfish and secretive. It , on the
other hand, when aspecting Mercury, renders the
native open, very generous magnanimous and a
lover of justice. The Sun makes the native, when
in c or Par. with Mercury, proud, haughty, majes
tic, commanding, a real boss, and endows the
native with ideas that are large and grand, in fact,
generally beyond his means to realize. 9, aspecting
Mercury at birth, if benefic, gives genuine ability
in art, literature and music, and endows him with
a true love of all that is beautiful in nature. When
the foregoing planets aspect Mercury with malefic
rays, it does not dimmish the abilities, but gives a



OF THE STAES. 75
vicious trend to them. Mars, when afflicting, pro
duces liars and people who are not over-scrupu
lous in their dealings. ^ makes malicious natures
always plotting and planning for their own inter
ests— genuine politicians of the wire-pulling fra
ternity. 2J, so afflicting, makes real frauds and
pretenders. W, dangerous characters of unusual
abilities, forgers and bubble floaters. The Sun
cannot afflict Mercury, but when both are afflicted
the native becomes a real tyrant. ?, when afflict
ing, renders the mind lewd and sensual and gives
an inclination for gambling, drink and the society
of the demi-monde.
After the influence of the Sun, Moon and Mer
cury has been carefully weighed, combine your
deductions with the natural disposition shown by
the Ascendant, and the analysis will be complete;
I noting that the L of $ to the O* and any aspect of
W to the Moon or $ confers much natural ability
for the study of occultism.
The Financial Pkospects. —When the Sun and
Moon are in good aspect with each other and un
afflicted, it shows a fairly comfortable position all
through life, according to the plane the native occu
pies. Benefic planets in the 2nd is a- good testi
mony if they are at the same time well aspected



ID THE LANGUAGE
and strong; it is a sign of wealth, and if. in addi
tion to this, they happen to be in good aspect to
the Sun or Moon, or both, comparative wealth and
a corresponding position in life is certain. Benefic
planets in the 10th may be considered the same
with the same rules. Further: If Saturn be well
aspected in the 2nd or 10th and direct in motion
in a sign of his own nature, he confers lasting ben
efit; such men become rich by one gradual pro
gressive march from the bottom of the ladder to
the top. But Mars, so situated, always squanders
wealth; it is against his very principle to save,
Per contra, the Sun and Moon, afflicting each
other, or much afflicted by other planets, is a sign
of poverty or hard struggle against adverse cir
cumstances; if Saturn be afflicted in the 2nd or
10th, it is a sign of cramped finance; if, at the
same time, he afflicts the San and Moon or one of
them and no benefic intervenes its influence, the
native will have a hard struggle all through life;
when to such a position we find Mars in the 2nd),
the native becomes a 'ne'er-do-well"—an unfortu*
nate, improvident wretch,
When the testimonies conflict with each other
i as they usually do), the student must use his dis
cretion with his judgment, and here comes the



OF THE STARS. 77
real value of personal experience obtained only
through study, experiment and continual practice;
mixed indication gives a mixed or an average life;
when Jupiter is on the ascendant, or the meridian,
such a position will carry the native through life
with his head above water, though he may never
realize much comfort.
Applying these rules to the horoscope in these
lessons, we find that Venus rules Mercury both by
6 and Par., also that the Moon is % to both, while
the O is Par. to $; this gives most elegant abilities
of a literary, musical and artistic nature; combine
these with the "ascendant, a reflective, cautious,
laborious nature, given by Saturn, and we find all
the necessary application and patience to carry out
the abilities to a successful issue.
The financial prospects are mixed; T?, is Par. to
U, and the f); the 0, q, to the «D, but the Sun is
elevated, is lord of the 2nd, and is Par to ?, hence
fair financial circumstances may be expected, the
result of the native's own careful persistence,
patience, economy and natural talents.



THE LANGUAGE Of THE STARS,
LESSON XIII.
"THE BUSINESS QUALIFICATIONS AND MARRIAGE
PROSPECTS.
The Business Qualifications. —As stated in
the lesson, showing how to form a general judg
ment, the business qualifications of the native
depend upon the temperament, the mental ability
and the financial prospects; because no matter
what the natural talents may be, it is useless to
put a child to a business that would result in finan
pial failure. The most valuable course is to find
out that department in life wherein the horoscope
shows the most success, and then select that special
branch of it that is most suitable to the native's
temperament and mental capacity.
Those born with Saturn rising are suited to
some patient, steady calling requiring application.
Those with Jupiter rising succeed as merchants'
Mars produces mechanics. Venus, some light,



THE LANGUAGE Of THE STARS. <9
fancy business. Mercury, literature, law and in
surance. The moon denotes some general retail
business. If these planets be in good aspect to
the Sun, the indication is so much the stronger.
Tnen n, £? and Tit are scientific in their nature, EC
giving legal ability and literary qualities, Aqua
rius talent in electricity and magnetism; TTj, gives
especial ability in surgery, medicine and chem
istry.
These rules Will show the natural trend of the
native. Next examine the mid-heaven and its lord,
and especially that planet most powerfully aspect
ing the Sun; or, if no planet aspect the Sun, take
the Moon. Should the mid-heaven be afflicted by
the presence of malefics who are afflicted or r>,the
native will never succeed in any business of his
own, bat had far batter always devote himself as
an assistant in the employ of others. So ; likewise,
if the luminaries be seriously afflicted by the mal-
eScs without corresponding aid from the benefics,
the same remarks will apply. Per contra, if the
mid-heaven be occupied by planets well aspected
and strong, take these to indicate the nature of the
native's business. If, at the same time, they aspect
the Sun, or the Sun be there, or the Sun be free
from affliction, success is a certainty in a business



80 THE LANGUAGE
of his own, if he can obtain one. And this is a
most important point to consider, because some
people do well and live comfortably as long as they
are in the employ of others, but make a miserable
failure immediately they undertake to strike out a
path for themselves. To be contented with one's
own natural sphere and to live in harmony with
our own inherent possibilities^ resting satisfied
that Mother Nature is infinitely wiser in her selec
tion of our status than we could ever be ourselves,
is to obtain the greatest possible good out of this
life and properly prepare our souls for the higher
gamut of existence in the next.
The Matrimonial Prospects —For a male,
take the Moon, Venus, and any planet that may be
in the 7th; if none be there, then look well to the
lord of the 7th. If the Moon and Venus be strong,
the former increasing in light, and they be well
aspected with the 7th house, free from the pres
ence of malefic orbs, you may conclude that mar
riage will transpire at a suitable age and that
domestic happiness may result. The presence of
Venus or Jupiter unafflicted in the 7th is a sure
sign of domestic felicity. On the other hand, \ <3,
W, especially the latter, are sure indications of
discord and failure in the conjugal state. If the
(Mfuh^ W '^J)4^ ibjhmdk



OF THE STARS. 81
Moon and Venus be much afflicted, without aid
from Jupiter and no benefic in the 7th, domestic
inharmony is the result, and especially so if
Uranus be one of the afflicting planets. The evil
aspect of Saturn delays marriage. The benefic
rays of Mercury hasten marriage. Ditto with
Mars. If Mars afflicts the Moon or Venus, he
often brings about a marriage in great haste, and
gives ample leisure to bitterly repent. Study well
the 7th house, the Moon and Venus, and form
judgment accordingly. With this exception, that
with a female natus, substitute the Sun for the
Moon, and then judge the same.
The business qualities and matrimonial pros
pects, being the last group of importance, except
sickness and disease, we will apply the rules to the
child's natus as before. In this case, the Sun is
strong and in the mid-heaven, but it is square to
the Moon and 8 to W, producing lack of support
from the public, if a solar occupation be chosen
that is ruled by T ; also a bad ending and sudden re
verses, W 8 to the O in the 4th 1J . Therefore, bearing
in mind the temperament, the patience and method
of the native, we must combine the Sun with
something else, and this is easily seen, viz., £ and $
both in the sign in the mid-heaven, $ Par. to the O
and the ruler JJT of, and both $ and £ * to the <D,



82 THE LANGUAGE OF THE STARS.
giving public success in all occupations ruled by $
and £ combined; so again bearing in mind the art
istic abilities of the native, we should say that he
would succeed best as a photographic artist, or as a
dealer in pictures, musical instruments and artist's
materials.
The marriage prospects are not good. W Par. to
the and ? and ^ P. D, to the f), with the Moon
going to Vs S, and in to the 0, all point to the
fact that marriage would be delayed, and consider
ing his nature, he is not a marrying man. *> cools
the rjassions considerably, and if he marries it will
be late in life, for a home rather than for love.
Uranus to the €) will always produce domestic
inharmony until late in life.



THE LANGUAGE OF THE STARS.
LESSON XIV.
FRIENDS, ENEMIES, TRAVELS AND VOYAGES.
The friends of the native are to be judged as
follows; If the luminaries are afflicted especially
the Moon by Saturn, the native will suffer much
from false friends; and if . at the same time an evil
planet occupy the 11th house (symbolical of friend
ship ), that native will all through life, be duped
by his friends, chiefly of the nature of the sign and
planet in the 11th.
If a malefic occupy the 11th, it is a strong token
of unreliable deceitful friends; but, unless the
luminaries be afflicted and. weak, the deceit will not
injure the native. But, if Saturn afflict the lumi
naries and be in the 11th, this is the worst possible
position, and the native never ought to have con
fidants or friends who have power over him. The
same may be said, but with less power, of L^ranns
and Mars.
On the contrary, the luminaries strong and well
aspected and a benefic in the 11th or the lord



81 THE LANGUAGE
thereof in good aspect with or I, the native
will have many friends, will receive assistance
from them, and can repose confidence therein.
Also the lord of the 11th a benefic, and not afflicted,
but strong and in elevation, is a sign of good, noble,
trustworthy friends during life.
The enemies of the native are judged exactly
the same as friends, except the 12th must be taken
instead of the 11th; and for opponents in life, open
opposition, take the 7th house instead of the 12th,
and judge exactly as in the case of friends. Thus,
if a benefic occupy the 7th, it is a sign of but little
opposition in life; if, at the same time, it is strong,
well aspected, and in good aspect to the sun or the
lord of the 10th, it shows that the native will gain
by opposition, that his public opponents will be the
real means of his advancement, which is generally
the case with public men.
The travels of the native must be considered
thus: The Moon in the Ascendant in a movable
or common sign shows that the native will travel
about a good deal and value his home but little.
The same may be said if the Moon be increasing
in light, fast in motion, and in aspect to £ or ?,
especially so if these latter be in movable- or com
mon signs and fast in motion, but the reverse if



OF ^HE STARS. 8S
they be 5 (retrograde) and in fixed signs. If
these testimonies are from the 3rd house, railroad
or short journeys are indicated; if from the 9th,
voyages or long journeys are presignified.
On the contrary, the Moon in a fixed sign and
slow in motion indicates but little travel, and
if to this a fixed sign occupies the Asc, the native
will be a home bird and love to remain in some
permanent location.
When signs of much travel are shown, a malefic
in the 3rd or 9th indicates misfortune thereby, and
also suffering by and through travel, If a benefic
be JJ in the 3rd or 9th and afflicted, it shows that
the journeys will be difficult and fail to profit the
native anything, anticipation will fail to be real
ized; but, if a benefic be therein direct in motion
mid well aspected, it indicates much success and
profit or pleasure by travel, and this is especially
so if the benefic be at the same time in good aspect
to the Sun, Moon, lord of the 2nd or the 10th,



THE LANGUAGE OF THE STARS,
LESSON XV.
ACCIDENTS, SICKNESS AND DISEASE.
For accidents, consider well the Hyleg. If the
giver of life be in bad aspect to Mars, accidents
are certain to transpire during life, when the
Hyleg forms any malefic direction thereto. The
same remarks apply, but with less force, to Uranus.
I say "less force," because the mystical orb is so
uncertain and eccentric in results. He may, when
so situated, cause accident or some sudden form
of disease of an unusual nature. Accidental poison
ing is in strict sympathy with Uranus,
When the Hyleg is free from the affliction of
Mars and Uranus at birth, there is little danger of
accident, except by indirect action, thus: Mercury,
if malefic by strong aspect to W or 3, and afflicting
the Hyleg, may give accident; the same may be
said of the Moon, as both are simply the mediums
for the interaction of other forces. But, when



THE LANGUAGE OE THE STARS. 87
none of these testimonies transpire, the native will
remain free from accident, but may suffer from
disease.
The Hyleg strong shows a vigorous vitality and
comparative freedom from disease, if, at the same
time, the physical constitution is of a similar
nature. When the constitution is weak and the
vital force strong, the native will live on to a good
old age, and suffer much during life from various
forms of disease, indicated by the nature of the
influence causing such weakness.
Saturn, afflicting the Hyleg, or constitution,
always produces a predisposition to some chronic
disease. Mars produces the same liability to some
acute diseases, which may degenerate and become
chronic by neglect of proper medical treatment.
When disease, by virtue of a good constitution
and strong Hyleg is not probable, sickness can
only afflict the native by the action of very potent
directions, and such sickness will be of short dura
tion always The native either recovers or dies
quickly, but death under such circumstances will
only transpire when the vital energy is weak from
age.
To particularize: The sign occupying the cusp
of the 6th house indicates the natural part of the



88 THE LANGUAGE
body liable to disease and its nature, to some ex
tent; this is especially so should any retrograde
planet or one afflicted or a malefic be therein. The
special organs of the body ruled by the signs and
planets have been given in the first portion of this
work, and need not be repeated,
The principal forms of disease signified by the
planets are as follows: Uranus, all unusual mental 1
magnetic and nervous diseases; ^, consumption^
cold, melancholy complaints, slow fevers, etc.; Zf,
all afflictions of the liver and blood; Mars, all in
flammatory afflictions, acute fevers and marital
diseases; ?, cutaneous afflictions, diseases of the
uterus, kidneys, etc.; £, chiefly mental and ner
vous diseases, The Sun shows sharp and chronic
diseases and the so-called incurable diseases of the
brain and heart. The Moon rules all acute dis
eases in sickness and indicates afflictions of the
lungs, stomach and breast
As this is the most important subject, we will
illustrate our remarks by applying the foregoing
rules to the horoscope, given as an example in
these lessons.
In this case the Hyleg (the Sun) is Par. to Ura
nus, and also in opposition thereto from cardinal
signs, both being angular; and as Uranus is lord of



OF THE Sf AES. 89
the 8th also, he is the anareta of this natus; sc
also is Saturn in some sense, being angular, a ruler
of the 8th, and Par. to the Moon, This child, then,
is very liable to some severe accident, probably a
fall, as Uranus is in *£=, an airy sign^ and Moon,
the mother of all things, n to the ©, and Par. ^ is
also to tTranus. The reason we judge a fall is
that Uranus, being the prime mover in the matter,
is peculiar for his sudden, unexpected action, such
as a fall is. The head and loins would be the chief
parts to suffer, represented by T and =£*
.
For diseases, the head, chest and heart would be
the principal seats of suffering; the brain and
heart being in sympathy to the Sun, while the
Moon rules the chest, and Saturn in the sign with
the Sun applying by direction to the square
thereof, indicates afflictions of the heart, lungs
and stomach.
For sickness generally, it may be said that the
native will be dyspeptic, *> in £3 rising, and every
lunar arc to Saturn of a malefic nature will cause
sickness to the native.



CONCLUSION.
These primary lessons are now brought to a
close; our task is completed. We have given a
brief but clear outline of each department of
human life of any real importance, and all thet is
necessary for the student to become fairly expert
in this sublime study is personal practice.
The best advice we can offer is to investigate
the lives of as many personal acquaintances as
possible, when their time of birth is beyond dis
pute. We say personal acquaintances, for the
reason that their real lives will be known fairly
well, whereas we cannot obtain the truth from any
written biography. To place much reliance upon
the lives of eminent men as given forth in print,
with the expectation of finding their horoscope to
correspond, is a very fallacious method, except so
far as real known personal traits of character or
public fame is concerned. Above all, apply these
rules to your own individual life; you alone know
the motive of your every action, and will be able
to trace the action of the stars from cause to effect



THE LANGUAGE OF THE STARS. 91
better than any one else. Obtain all the data
within your reach of children who die in infancy;
study well our rules relating to the Hyleg, life and
health, and so confirm and improve your own per
sonal judgment. Thus, step by step, build up
your precept by practice, and your theory with
absolute knowledge, for only in this manner can
you really possess the priceless treasure of Urania.
Reading and study alone, though of unquestion
able import and value, will never enable you to
fully realize these Divine truths. Practical expe
rience alone can do this.
And, lastly, let me advise the student to care
fully master the details of each lesson before he
attempts to put the rules in practice; also the
meaning of the various terms used and found in
the " Appendix." When this is done, supplement
your knowledge by a thorough, impartial study of
the best authors upon the subject—the works of
* Wilson," and "Pearce," and Dr. Simmonite,"
are the most valuable. This fine work of the latter
author, "The Arcana of Astrology,"* is especially
valuable for students, it being in the form of les
sons, with questions at the end of each, and con
taining many valuable tables for astro-calculations.
With this we close, trusting that our efforts to
instruct the student may not entirely fail, and that

Rectification — Correcting or rectifying the esti

many methods, the two principal ones being, rec

the semi-arc method of calculation of arcs, and
also by the truitine of " Hermes Trismegistus";
of all systems the latter is the only one really re
liable. It is based upon the occult fact that there
is a uniform relationship between the place of the
Moon at birth with the ascendant, at the moment
of conception^and vice versa, with the place of the
Moon at conception and the ascendant at birth,

This map gives the relative positions, outlines and forms of most of the ancient constellations as used by Ptolemy and the Arabian Astrologers. There were anciently but 48 constellations, 12 in the zodiac and 36 outside of it. Those 48 original constellations are the only ones recognized in Astrology. The ancient Magi used these forms because by their use the novitiate students could memorize the entire celestial map and hold in mind all the longitudes and declinations. A finished professor not only had all fixed star positions memorized, but he mentally interpolated for his planetary ephemeries day by day.
