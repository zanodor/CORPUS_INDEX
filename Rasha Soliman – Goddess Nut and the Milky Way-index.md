Abstract
Science has always been intriguing to all humanity, as long as they have been conscious of the outer universe. Astronomy is the most ancient of all the
sciences, the study of the night sky – from the planets and moons to the stars
and galaxies; the skies have always been regarded with admiration. Inscriptions and pictorial representations on ceilings of both ancient Egyptian tombs and temples give indications to the mythological views of the ancient Egyptian geographical conditions and celestial bodies to be mirrored in their sky. Heaven has been deservedly considered as a direct manifestation of wholeness, divine power, sacredness and everlastingness, which no terrestrial being could attain.
Goddess Nut, the ancient Egyptian goddess of the heavens and sky, pictured as a naked female arches her body across the sky (basically east to west and like the arc of the sky) in a protective posture over the earth. Nut plays a signiicantly important role towards this symbolism in her depictions as the sky vault, hosting the course of the Sun and of the stellar bodies. It is there on her body – that the cosmic activities take place. Not only she takes but also gives back life in a periodical repetitive eternal cycle, introducing the human biological cycle parallel to the cosmic phenomena. An acceptable standard plan of the terrestrial river’s luidity onto the celestial sphere, where the Galaxy was considered as a heavenly river. Thus, ancient Egyptians equated Nut›s body with the Milky Way.
However, many Egyptologists and archaeoastronomers consider this highly hypothetical. The relation of Nut to the Milky Way was derived from the possibility that the Egyptians saw her as the luminous stellar band of the Milky Way where the east and the west almost deceptively coincide with its beginning and end on the horizon. This paper aims to discuss the archetypal myth of Nut’s body and her association to the Milky Way.

Introduction
Heaven has been deservedly considered as a direct display of wholeness, divine power, sacredness and eternity. Heaven is the universal symbol of cosmic order and ininite space revealed in the regular rotational action and rhythms of the celestial bodies, hidden in the idea of invisible orders of existence that are superior to the extraordinary world, uniting the superb considerable divine and the human orders(Chevalier & Gheerbrant, 1996). Thus, the sky deines two distinct virtual units the cosmic space and established time.
In the late 1800’s Lockyer, a British astronomer considerably studied Egyptian astronomy. He breaks ancient astronomy into three distinct phases. First, the civilization goes through the adoration stage, where astronomical wonders are viewed only as the actions, moods, and warnings of the gods. Thus, the Ancient Egyptians started the worship stage and eventually began to see how astronomy could help them in their daily lives.
Second, a civilization advanced using astronomy for earthly purposes, such as for agriculture or navigation. The third and inal stage was to study astronomy merely for the sake of gaining awareness (Lockyer, 1984).
Our ancestors had a lot of time to observe the repeated cycles with all the day and night experiences that revolve the night under an open sky without the
reliance on all the modern and technological equipment. Time for Egyptians
was cyclic - the annual rhythm of the Nile, the seasons of planting and harvest, the celestial bodies repeating their rounds. They were fascinated with the sky allowing them to analyze it thoroughly, recognize regular patterns, and attempt to develop views and religious myths based on these patterns.
The awe with the skies played a vital part in ancient Egyptian religion. The ancient Egyptians saw the Milky Way, visible as a faint cloud of stars stretching across the sky, mirroring the River Nile in the heavens, thus believed it to be the “celestial Nile”. Scholars mistakenly convey goddess Nut, who stretched all the way across the sky as the Milky Way since she was portrayed in tombs giving birth to her celestial offspring and was conceived as a body of fresh water like the Nile, the dieties travelled in their celestial boats to be reborn in the west - the
land of the dead.

Astronomy and Goddess Nut
The ancient Egyptians regarded the sky goddess Nut as a naked female who arches her body across the sky mainly from east to west and like the curve of the sky in a protective position over the earth. Nut›s ingers and toes were believed to touch the four cardinal points or directions. A myth, recorded in dynastic times, has the god Ra entering Nut›s mouth, passing through her starry body, and emerging, or is reborn, from her thighs. Egyptian tombs were thought of as virtual small universes. Nut plays a considerably important role towards this symbolism in her depictions as the sky vault, accommodating the course of the Sun and of the stellar bodies. Nut, a devouring female, was the source of life and regeneration. Not only she takes but also gives back life in a repetitive eternal cycle, suggesting the human biological cycle as well as the cosmic phenomena. Cosmic activities take place on her body; periodical changes of the sky with its constellations, sun, and moon.
The skies compose the panorama for the motion of cosmic bodies that
produces the conception of time as an all – including the limit of continuous
change (Jung, 1959). Female heavenly deities, like Nut, are symbols of hidden transformation, pertaining to the junction of a dream world to the real world of life. Nut, was considered a model of a protecting Universal Mother (Blackman, 1935; Wb. III: Jung, 1956). Uniting with her would mean the return to the womb
of eternal space-time range and passing victoriously through immortality.
Hence, the sky would become a nursery for the deceased.
According to the astronomer Ronald Wells, he hypothesized that the Egyptians equated Nut›s body with the Milky Way, seeing her head in the Gemini constellation, and her birth canal in Cygnus, where the cosmic dust clouds split the Milky Way into two «legs.» (ig.1) He pointed out that early i Egyptian prehistory, about 6,500 years ago; the Sun would have set just before Gemini-Nut›s head-at the spring equinox, as if swallowed by the goddess. Nine months later, at the winter solstice, the Sun, reborn, would have risen very close to Cygnus, as if emerging from the birth canal. Other scholars also agreed along with this hypothesis especially that in Spell 176 oBf otohkeof the Dead, there is reference to this broad band of stars, which travelled the night sky. However,
many Egyptologists and archaeoastronomers consider this particular theory
highly hypothetical (Wells, 1992).
Professional astronomers recently published maps of the ancient Egyptian sky, as it would have appeared during the pre-dynastic period on the morning of the winter solstice. Goddess Nut deines a virtual space- time ield, which

comprises the cosmic space and ininite time becomes conventional in the framework of her representations. The origin of the sky as a female deity agrees with the ancient Egyptian approaches of thought of ancient theologians, whose environment suggested these ideas. Thus, her soft, watery and alterable
characteristics as a goddess – a likely conventional prediction of the earthly
river’s luidity onto the celestial domain, where the Galaxy was considered by
several ancient nations as a heavenly river (Allen, 1963; Kozloff, 1933).
Fig.(1) The constellations of Gemini and Cygnus along the outline of the body of Goddess Nut relatively during the spring and winter solstices.
Interestingly, in theBook of Coming Forth by Day, Nut has evidence of being the Milky Way: in Chapter 69 a relationship between the constellation of the Orion and the Milky Way who is mentioned as goddess Nut, shows the constellation of the Orion moving closely amongst the bright stars within the body of Nut. Distinctively, they are two separate phenomena that are adjoined, the body of Nut and the stars within her body (Beatty, 1998).
The Milky Way exhibits an amazing likeness to the outstretched igure of goddess Nut, with her feet on one horizon and her hands touching the other. The sun would have appeared at the winter solstice in the correct area of the igure’s anatomy to suggest observers that it was being born by Nut. Nine months earlier, at the spring equinox, the sun began to rise an hour and a quarter after sunset in such position that it “appeared deceptively” to fall into Nut’s mouth, which would have easily implied the belief that the great female goddess of the sky was enguling the sun, only to give birth to the sun nine months later during the last days of what is now December (Baumgartel, 1955).
The ancient Egyptians were aware of the Milky Way; known to be a narrow band of many individual stars. Even the sun was known to have not moved alone but within the broader framework of the Milky Way. Therefore, the celestial phenomena emphasized that astronomy is not unharmonious with myth. A myth empowered by ancient Egyptians to express and clarify the elements

of their understanding with myth of their celestial beliefs and observations (Beatty, 1998). Professional astronomers recently published maps of the ancient Egyptian sky, as it would have appeared during the pre-dynastic period on the morning of the winter solstice.
The Milky Way
In the Milky Way galaxy the earth lies as part of the solar system, at the edge of a spiral arm called the Orion Arm. Every year the earth crosses the galactic equator twice (ig. 2). As seen from Earth, the moon crosses the galactic equator two (sometimes three) times a month. All of this crossing of the galactic equator is just part of the sky’s normal motion, as well as, the earth’s normal motion as projected on our sky’s vault as we voyage around the sun.
Fig. (2) The Galactic equator and its intersection with the winter solstice.
The three major great circles on the so-called celestial sphere – the ecliptic, celestial equator and galactic equator – make up an elaborate but convenient iction of a surrounded sphere above our heads and beneath our feet (ig. 3). During ancient Egyptian times the ecliptic had never overlapped the Milky Way.
Fig. (3) The great circle of the ecliptic intersects the great circle of the celestial equator at the equinox
points, and intersects the great circle of the galactic equator near the solstice points. The galactic
equator is not shown in the illustration.

Several scholars have insinuated that Egyptian myths were created to explain what early people saw in the sky, for example, that Nut was created to personify the Milky Way (Velde, 1982). The associating of Nut to the Milky
Way was possibly a result to the Egyptians believing that this goddess coincides
with the “beginning” and “end” on the horizon, it is evident that the east and
west would also be considered as both respectively an “entrance” and an “exit”
to heaven or the next life. Some stars rise at the same point as the Sun, very
“near” the Milky Way on the horizon, wherefrom they seem deceptively to be
rejuvenated.
Furthermore, certainly the sun sets from the west and rises from the east, “close” to the Milky Way, but not at the actual part of the Milky Way as known from the conventional myth of Ra being absorbed by Nut in the evening and accordingly being reborn the next morning. When it is said that the solar barque of Ra sailed the Milky Way, this also debates that god Ra was an entity that can only be observed in the night along the Milky Way. Therefore, Ra would not be interpreted as the actual sun itself (Lesko, 1999). This is a common error that is frequently repeated by scholars of mythological interests.
Conclusion
Nut is alleged in a useful effective hypothesis since the Milky Way was “one” of the celestial forms of Nut, nevertheless, the other form would be known to us as the celestial vault itself. Advocating that there are several forms in the Milky Way vault, and naturally Nut is not the whole galaxy of the Milky Way but only “one” of its forms, suggesting that she was viewed as only part of the sky, not the entire canopy or vault. Moreover, another possible unmerited
myth is that all supreme deities, creator deities and archetypes are carefully
connected to the “outlines” of the Milky Way observed all around the earth
causing a misconception of its actual location.
Accordingly, it is common to believe that “the Milky Way was the celestial form of Nut” but it should have been “ the Milky Way was one of the celestial forms of Nut” since another form would have been the actual celestial vault itself.
Finally let us point out that the sun apparently as seen from earth along with the pattern of the movements of our planet and sun, as well as the projection effects of crossing the Milky Way at certain times of the year; all these movements do not always happen upon the Milky Way. Signiicantly, the sun crosses the Milky Way at certain times of the year but it was never moving all the time suring the Milky Way as the Egyptians had represented the sun’s voyage only sailing through the body of Nut. The Milky Way myth as being goddess Nut remains commonly attractive despite the facts that contradict it.
