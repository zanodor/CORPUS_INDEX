Praise for Maya Cosmogenesis 2012
"Jenkins' Maya Cosmogenesis 2012 presents a fascinating, meticu¬ lously researched, exquisitely reasoned, scholarly yet readable account of the development of ancient Mesoamerican astro-spirituality, and offers an inspiring poetic vision of humanity's future." —Douglas Gillette, author of The Shaman's Secret: Lost Resurrection Teachings of the Ancient Maya
"With [Jenkins] scholarly effort of comparative calendric research and investigation into Mayan cosmology, we may all ascend to new lev¬ els of insight concerning the wealth of coded messages that remain in the Mayan legacy to modern mankind in this age of transformation." —Jim Reed, The Institute of Maya Studies
"In the process of reading the account to this fascinating solution to the reason for the famed Mayan end-time date, Jenkins takes the reader through a well-researched psychoarcheological and astronomi¬ cal excursion of the Mayan mind field of time." —Dr. Jose Arguelles, author of The Mayan Factor
"Looking in the right direction makes all the difference in what one sees. Historians tend to look to the past, considering that in the nature of their job; but Maya culture has always been arguably future-oriented, naming time cycles small and large for their end-dates, and so investi¬ gators have tended to look the wrong way in their interpretations of those cycles, especially the largest: precession. Building on the pioneer¬ ing work of de Santillana and von Dechend (Hamlet’s Mill) and Scheie [Maya Cosmos), repeatedly tested by his own observations at key sites, Jenkins here lays out the impressive results of 14 years of dedicated
study and inspired synthesis." —Stephen Eberhart, Department of Mathematics, California State University, Northridge
"Maya Cosmogenesis 2012 is not a work of speculation or wishful thinking, it is a clearheaded piece of well-documented research . . . using facts, not fancies, Jenkins leads us into the complex world of Mesoamerican iconography, cosmology, astrology, and astronomy and shows us how ancient insights are relevant to today's world." —Bruce Scofield, author of Signs of Time: An Introduction
to Mesoamerican Astrology



ONE HUNAHPU
Source of matter, source of spirit
Spiraling in and spiraling out
Thirteen phases—numbers, vectors
Twenty hieroglyphic pictures
People growing toward the sun
Grow together and live as one
Hunab Ku, Hunahpu
Hub of everything we do
Search the stars for what we are
And find we need not look so far
Inside of us, deep down inside
Are kept the secrets of all time
Finding rhythm, speaking rhyme
Renew the ancient paradigm
Movement and measure
Sowing and dawning
Star of the evening
Star of the morning
One Ahau will start the churning
Watch for Venus, begin the learning
Teaching us the way to see
And how to climb the Sacred Tree
Tzolkin, Haab, and Calendar Round
Spherical music, magical sound
Eye at the center, dawn of our face
Edge of the cosmos, heart of all space
Mysterious day-sign
Bringer of Birth
It comes from the stars
And springs from the Earth

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
E
llen, thank you eternally for loving me and believing in me throughout the
grueling and uncertain process of turning this vision into a reality. Many thanks
to Barbara Hand Clow for her understanding, encouragement, and suggestions on
how to restructure the book, and for believing in the timeliness and value of my
work. And Carl Lehrburger, who by hailing me when the doors of opportunity be¬
gan to open, may be solely responsible for this book being published. Thanks to
Terence McKenna for proving that visionary philosophers can make a living in a
world gone trendy. Blessings and Dharmic obeisances to Kurt Joy for having the
cosmic eye of the visionary shaman, for laughter, and for keeping me on the path.
For her thorough editing, restructuring of ideas, the text, and her extra effort
on a project that certainly needed special attention, I greatly appreciate Joan Wilcox.
Thanks to all the people at Bear & Company for their enthusiastic support and jobs
well done, including John Nelson and Jody Winters. Special thanks to Beth Hansen
Winter for her wonderful interior design.
Great heartfelt thanks to Jim Reed, friend, believer, and Maya ceremonialist to
whom I dedicate the poem entitled One Hunahpu. I would not be who I am with¬
out my family: Dad, Mom, Ralph, Grama Alice and Grama Bea, Cindy and Barry,
Bill, Don and Erika, Deb, Jessica, Sarah, Kim, Leah, Jillian, Ken and Keith—with
encouragement and interest, they've seen my passion for the Maya grow and bear
many fruits. And to my Boulder friends, who saw me start with nothing and who
never gave up on me: Steve and Kelly, Erik and Shara, Sharon and Joe, and all my
friends at the Lighthouse Coffee Shop in Louisville. Special thanks to Kathy Pate,
who has seen me through a dozen other projects, for appreciating the needs of a
rebel scholar and for her support during the time of discovery. Gratitude also is due
to Mayanists past and present, whose dedicated studies of Maya cosmology and
culture have provided the foundation of my new synthesis.
Finally, thanks to the unknown ancient shamans and skywatchers, those who
gazed into the cosmic center, and to the modern Maya people who have inspired
and taught me by their lives and words. They continue to offer us profound insights
into the cosmic order.

e live in a time of unarguable and enormous change. And it is portentous
change which was, in the era before mechanized technology ruled the world,
the special province of seers, shamans, and prophets. We have, through the modern
sciences of archaeology and linguistic analysis, sifted the world of the past for data,
ideas, and visions pertinent to our own dilemma. I would argue that the most en¬
during and substantial legacies that we inherit from those ancient and far off times
are the Maya calendar and the I Ching. Both of these inventions, when properly
understood, move the heart nearer to the sources of all life.
As we investigate the past we find to our surprise that we are encountering its
understanding of our immediate future. This is an unprecedented situation, full of
awe-inspiring emotion and intellectual excitement. Our planet is in the process of
transforming itself; this process is at a critical juncture, and to the degree that we
can widen our mental screens to admit the ever-larger context in which our lives
and our civilizations exist, we appreciatively participate in a great leap forward in
the revelation of the Tao.
With these ideas as a driving force in my own journey, naturally it was with a
great deal of pleasure that I accepted the invitation of traveler and scholar John
Major Jenkins to write a foreword to Maya Cosmogenesis 2012, a revolutionary
work of discovery and synthesis. In 1975, as Jenkins generously recalls, I was the
first person to realize and to suggest in print (The Invisible Landscape) "that in our
time, the winter solstice is placed in the constellation Sagittarius, only about 3
degrees from the Galactic Center which, also coincidentally, is within 2 degrees of
the ecliptic. Because the winter solstice node is precessing, it is moving closer and
closer to the point on the ecliptic where it will eclipse the galactic center." The
reason that the notion of the importance of a heliacal solstice rising with the Ga¬
lactic Center was even available to me was because I, like Jenkins himself, was
inspired and challenged by the ideas and speculations that had been put forth ear¬
lier by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend in their pathbreaking book
Hamlet’s Mill, published in English in 1969.
My path of discovery was different from Jenkins', a fact that I believe gives
greater credence to both our individual conclusions. By 1974 I was aware of the
approach of a heliacal solstice rising of the Galactic Center and its potential as a
XXV

time of renewal, yet astonishingly this was before I was aware that the astronomer
shamans of the Olmec/Maya had reached the same conclusions more than two
millennia ago. A different chain of logic led me to the same celestial events and the
same moment in time, and I recognized it as a moment of potential transformative
opportunity.
In the early 1990s, while in correspondence with John Jenkins, we discussed
the possibility that the end-date of the 13-baktun Great Cycle was intentionally
chosen by the Maya because of the conjunction of the sun with the intersection of
the ecliptic and the plane of the Milky Way on December 21, 2012—the 13.0.0.0.0
of the Long Count calendar. In my revised 1993 edition of The Invisible Landscape,
I stated that the end-date for my own mushroom-revealed model of the cosmos
ended on the same date as the Maya calendar but that the calculation of my end-date
had been done by different methods than those of the Maya and without knowledge
of those methods.
In the present work, John Major Jenkins has been able bring a new level of
detail and a much greater clarity of understanding to a complicated academic
situation, which is nevertheless fascinating. He has clarified and expanded these
basic intuitions into a true decipherment of the intention behind the Maya calen¬
dar and its ending date. This is a signal accomplishment, on a par with the deci¬
pherment of the Maya texts that has paralleled and enriched Jenkins' conclu¬
sions. His commitment to this problem has been years long, and his careful schol¬
arship has brought astonishing results. He, building carefully on the work of oth¬
ers, has shown that the intention of the Maya calendar makers was prophetic and
eschatological. The Maya believed, for reasons which are perhaps forever lost, or
perhaps soon to be revealed, that the coincidence of the winter solstice sunrise
with the part of the Milky Way that they called xibalba be would not be, as some
have stated, the end of the world, but its moment of true creation. The Maya
believed that creation would only truly occur at a predictable moment in the
future: our December 21, 2012.
In Maya Cosmogenesis 2012, Jenkins has shown that this precessional align¬
ment of the winter solstice sun with the galaxy is the phenomenon in nature to
which the ancient Olmec/Maya anchored their great calendar. Maya Cosmogenesis
2012 sets the stage for us to ask the deeper question: "Why?" This would be an
interesting question under any circumstances; for us in these times it is doubly
interesting, for we, by chance or design, actually live in the end time anticipated by



FOREWORD / XXVII
the ancient Maya shaman-prophets. Their bones and their civilization have long
since gone into the Gaian womb that claims all the children of time. Indeed, their
cities were ghostly necropoleis by the time the Spanish conquerors first gazed upon
them, five hundred years ago. Yet it was our time that fascinated the Maya, and it
was toward our time that they cast their ecstatic gaze, though it lay more than two
millennia in the future at the time the first Long Count dates were recorded.
This is hair-raising stuff. Our own civilization, with its cults of the ephemeral
and the material, might easily miss the point. And the task of appreciating the
Maya is not made any easier by the fact that the specious archaeological fantasies
of the New Age have poured scorn on all ancient knowledge that does not flow
from the putative founts of lost Lemuria, high Atlantis, and even more dubious
realms that are far away indeed. The Maya confound all this with the same imper¬
turbable ease that they have confounded the Eurocentrism and condescension of
academic archaeology. The Maya really are an ancient civilization that may have
made discoveries and achieved an understanding deeper than our own in areas which
we have tended to claim as our own.
This is the astonishing news that Jenkins brings: Modern astronomy is appar¬
ently not the first community of scholars to appreciate and study the structure of
the greater cosmos. We can marvel over the "coincidence" of our own physicists'
discovery of a black hole at the center of our galaxy and the Maya belief in a great
black hole in the same spot, and thereby miss the point. This is no coincidence.
Our minds and our mathematics are not so different from the ancient Maya that by
different but convergent paths our science and theirs could not reach the same
perspective.
This being said, what then of the Maya prediction/assumption/discovery of
a.d. 2012 as the time of the transformation of the world? First of all, is there some
scientific basis for the idea that when the winter solstice sunrise "stands" on the
Galactic Center that any unusual physical effects might be expected? Today sci¬
ence answers in the negative. But science, unlike religion, is ever-growing and re¬
visiting and revising its own past simplifications. Do the spiral structure of the
galaxy and the spiral structures of the molecules that create and maintain all life
exist in a relationship of resonance? This should be investigated. "As above, so
below" taught the alchemists of our own esoteric traditions. Did the Maya make
more than a metaphor out of the perception that man is the mirror of the macro¬
cosm? Is human fate and the larger drama of the galaxy somehow linked? Coupling



XXVIII / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
mechanisms may be difficult to prove, but elucidation of subtle coupling mecha¬
nisms is what the new science of dynamics is designed to do.
We do not need the Maya and their prophetic calendar to know that we are
living in times in which the ways of the world are being hammered and recast upon
the anvil of fate. Our own calendar, rational in conception and intent—yet by its
own millennial turning now upon us—inevitably directs our attention to larger
scales of time and larger possibilities of being than those that claimed the attention
of our recent ancestors. We know that we have come to a time of shift and renewal.
We need, in this time more than any other, to understand and draw hope from the
faith of the Maya that our time—this time now upon us—is the time of true cre¬
ation. For it must be so.
Over millennia the Maya observed the drama of the approach of father sun
toward the vagina of mother sky and, though the cosmic event itself was calculated
to occur many centuries in the future, the Maya made the future conjunction the
anchor point of their machinery of cosmic time keeping. Their myth, they would
say the machinery of cosmic fate, chose our time as the quintessential moment of
creation. And in reality our times have lived up to that expectation. To the rational
mind this congruence is a coincidence, of little, if any interest at all. Yet as we
decipher the monuments and texts of the Classic Maya it becomes ever more clear
that they envisioned a world ruled by myths, they saw myths as the primary rud¬
ders of statecraft and civilization. The Maya sought to change and influence history
through the power of myth, and their most powerful myth was the myth of the
precessional drama and the end-time renewal. Collectively, as the twenty-first cen¬
tury dawns, we feel the ennui and exhaustion of the millennia-long practice of
Western religion, politics, and science,- we encounter the pollution and toxification
that is the legacy of our particular style of being in the world. And we also find,
among the endless bric-a-brac of the spiritual marketplace, the cosmogenic calen¬
dar of the ancient Maya. Can their temporal alchemy, which failed in the time of
their own cultural climax and left their cities empty by the time of the Conquest,
work for us? Can the Maya dream of renewal at the conjunction of winter solstice
and Galactic Heart redeem our civilization? I believe that it can play a significant
part, and that part of the resacralization of the world that must accompany any
valorization of post-historical time involves the recognition of the deep power and
sophistication of the aboriginal mind—not only the ancient aboriginal mind but
the contemporary aboriginal mind as well.

As we awaken to the power of the moving sky, as we awaken to the powers

doing so we should celebrate the wisdom of the Maya, ponder its depths, and won¬

INTRODUCTION
FIXING OUR SIGHTS
M
y fascination with the Maya began when I visited Mexico and Central
America in 1986. This was the first of several journeys I undertook, "trav¬
eling on a shoestring" through the remnants of a vast and mysterious civilization.
I explored dozens of ruins, many of them over a thousand years old. From the Yucatan
in the north to Honduras in the south, from Belize in the east to Mexico City in the
west, a vast civilization presented itself to me, and I was awestruck by its unfathomed
mysteries. This region is called, appropriately enough, Mesoamerica—the middle
of America. It is here that the Maya civilization arose, and it has tenaciously defied
being fully understood.
That first journey south of the border was a turning point in my life, a commit¬
ment to learning about the profound history of my home continent. Leaving Chi¬
cago on a dismal December day with a thousand dollars in my pocket, I looked
forward to several months of adventure, exploring ancient ruins and making friends
among the contemporary Maya. Above all, I hoped to catch a glimpse of that elusive
ancient knowledge, find some direction for my own life and, perhaps, to discover a
personal mission. My travels led me from Mexico City through Oaxaca, where I
visited the Zapotec capital of Monte Alban. After a few weeks dreaming on the
coastal beaches of Oaxaca, I made my way to the highlands of Chiapas, where I
welcomed in the New Year, 1987. Then I was ready for the heart of the journey:
Guatemala, with its volcanic peaks, beautiful Lake Atitlan, and dozens of ancient
ruins. Most importantly to me, the traditional Quiche Maya—some six million of
them—continue to live in the highlands, in remote villages where they still count
the days according to the ancient calendar and follow age-old traditions. And deep in
Guatemala's northern Peten rain forest, accessible only by a bone-jarring sixteen
hour bus ride on muddy and dangerous roads, I found Tikal, my personal mecca.
XXXI



XXXII / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
I can remember a moment when, seven weeks into the trip, I was overcome by
the sprawling former metropolis of Tikal. Sitting on the steps of the Central Acropo¬
lis, I looked around me at the towering sentinels of stone, their upper platforms
stretching above the jungle canopy like altars to the stars, and I listened carefully to
the wind whisper messages of a far-off time, and of another world. I thought about
the expanse of time and the depth of space above me. This place had been home to
some fifty thousand people at a time when London was a dirty market town of a
thousand. Questions began to stir in my mind: What drove the Maya to such feats
of accomplishment? What was their understanding about human nature, the stars,
and the cosmos? Where did they come from? What caused the demise of their thriv¬
ing cities? My questions were a natural outgrowth of a lifelong search for answers
about the nature of life, death, and human spirituality.
From an early age I had been fascinated by the world of ideas. I had devoured
everything I could on philosophy and cosmology. To me, cosmology involves more
than just the study of the cosmos and the nature of the world; it also includes the
role of human spirituality. My youthful curiosity led me through readings in sci¬
ence and philosophy, and deeper into Eastern mysticism. I soon found myself puz¬
zling over what was happening in the world, where we were all headed, and what
role human beings play in the evolution of life and consciousness. Ultimately, I
became interested in Native American beliefs, the Hopi prophecies, and then the
Maya. These interests led me to a contemplative moment at Tikal when, at age
twenty-two, I intuited that the knowledge of the ancient Maya was going to play a
significant role in the future development of Western philosophy and culture. There
was something deep and profound in the stones on which I sat, and I sensed that the
Maya were advanced in ways that my own world could barely appreciate or under¬
stand. Their minds seemed attuned to the cosmic spaces. Scholars had recognized
Maya kings as priests, fully involved in both the political and spiritual life of their
culture, but I envisioned Maya kings as time travelers, scientists, skywatchers, and
magicians, capable of feats recognized only in ancient Hindu and Buddhist texts.
While gazing at the carved monuments of the temple plazas of Guatemala's ruined
cities, I saw Maya king-shamans journeying along sky ropes, passing between worlds,
and communicating with other times and places. A lost knowledge echoed among
the stones, fragmented, awaiting rediscovery.
But what was this ancient knowledge? At that point on my path, I still wasn't
sure. I felt it had something to do with the sophisticated calendar systems used by



INTRODUCTION: FIXING OUR SIGHTS / XXXIII
the Maya, and I remembered reading in my guidebook that one of the Maya calen¬
dars was due to "end" on December 21, 2012. That date wasn't very far off. Why did
the ancient Maya choose that date, I wondered. What is the true meaning of the
Maya calendar end-date in a.d. 2012? The answer to this question became my per¬
sonal quest. A brief reading of the literature on this topic did not offer much apart
from unsatisfying generalizations. My gut feeling was that astronomy was involved,
and yet I could not locate any academic books that directly addressed this possibil¬
ity. That was over ten years ago.
Since 1986, the study of Maya science and religion has progressed by leaps and
bounds. Archaeologists continue to uncover ancient ruins and have excavated thou¬
sands of carved monuments, jade artifacts, rich burial tombs, painted ceramic vases,
and examples of the hieroglyphic writing invented by the Maya. Scholars have made
enormous progress deciphering the Maya script. Specialists can now read almost
all of these hieroglyphs, which reveal detailed histories for each Maya kingdom. In
addition, scholars have found and deciphered sacred texts that describe events that
occurred during the world's creation and successive re-creations. Many of these
texts have direct bearing on the meaning of the 2012 end-date. Another recent break¬
through occurred when scholars realized that Maya myth describes astronomical
events. In other words, there is a secret cosmological dimension encoded into Maya
mythology. The Creation myth of the Maya, the Popol Vuh, recounts the adven¬
tures of their most important deities and culture heroes. Since these Maya deities
represent astronomical objects such as stars and planets, their activities thus de¬
scribe astronomical processes. All of this evidence would provide a key to inter¬
preting the true scope of Maya knowledge, but it was not widely known back in
1986. It wasn't until the 1992 Austin Hieroglyphic meeting that Maya scholar Linda
Scheie revealed her interpretation of Maya Creation myth, in which she empha¬
sized the relationship between myth and astronomy. Her work was hailed as a break¬
through, and was fully rendered in her 1993 book Maya Cosmos, coauthored with
David Freidel and Joy Parker. I immediately saw the value of this new mytho-astro
nomical perspective, and it became my guiding principle as I searched more deeply
into the Maya mysteries.
Upon returning from that first trip south of the border, I began a course of
study that has resulted, over ten years, in seven books devoted to exploring the
esoteric secrets of Maya calendar science and religion. It is amazing what you can
do with a library card. I waded through popular and academic writings on Maya



XXXIV/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
astronomy, culture, religion, and calendar science. In my book Tzolkin: Visionary
Perspectives and Calendar Studies, I reconstructed the Maya Venus calendar and
explored the nature of the 260-day Maya sacred calendar, called the tzolkin. In so
doing, I was led to a closer look at another Maya calendar, the Long Count. The
Long Count calendar operates separately from the tzolkin and tracks very large
periods of time. I learned that the cycle of time that ends in a.d. 2012 is a period of
some 5,125 years. The Maya called this a period of 13 "baktuns," in which each
baktun lasts about 394 years. This large cycle began back in 3114 b.c. However, I
realized that this does not mean the Long Count was invented that far back. In fact,
I discovered that the Long Count calendar was invented only about 2,100 years ago,
when monuments dated in the Long Count start appearing in the archaeological
record. For example, the very first "Long Count monument" dates to 37 b.c. As
such, the 3114 b.c. "beginning" date appears to have been a back calculation. The
Maya astronomers calculated that between 3114 b.c. and a.d. 2012, a total of 13
"baktuns" would elapse.
But why, I asked myself, did this 13-baktun Great Cycle of the Long Count
calendar end in a.d. 2012? Why not a.d. 1712, or a.d. 2650? What determined the
placement of the 13-baktun Great Cycle in real time? I noticed that the 2012 end
date occurs precisely on the December solstice. Could it be that the "end" date was
the intended anchor for the placement of the Long Count calendar, rather than the
"beginning" date? I eventually found that some authors have attempted interpreta¬
tions of the end-date. For example, Frank Waters, in his 1975 book Mexico Mys¬
tique, analyzed astrology charts for the end-date.1 These were standard earth-cen¬
tered charts, and a professional astrologer described the configuration of planets as
being rare. This was intriguing information, yet somehow it just wasn't satisfying
to me. I felt that, certainly, astronomy was involved in the Maya end-date, but it
would have to be something really big to justify the end of a cycle of more than
5,000 years. Standard horoscope interpretations just do not address the Maya belief
that a World Age would be ending. More recently, The Mayan Prophecies by Maurice
Cotterell and Adrian Gilbert proposed that the 2012 end-date was chosen because
of sunspot extremes and their effects on human fertility.2 Theirs is an interesting
hypothesis, but in my view their theory has problems. I reviewed their book care¬
fully in 1995, interviewed Adrian Gilbert, and concluded that some doubt hung
over the sunspot hypothesis.
One thing was certain: The Maya believed the world will "end" in a.d. 2012.



I NTRODUCTION: FIXING OUR SIGHTS / XXXV
But what does this mean? The end-times doctrine can be interpreted in two ways:
metaphorically and literally. My metaphorical interpretation is that the Maya be¬
lieved that around the year we call 2012, a large chapter in human history will be
coming to an end. All the values and assumptions of the previous World Age will
expire, and a new phase of human growth will commence. Ultimately, I believe the
Maya understood this to be a natural process, in which new life follows a death. We
all experience this cycle of death and rebirth in our own lives: Our most difficult
experiences of suffering and loss are ultimately our best teachers. Imagine this prin¬
ciple taking effect on the level of the entire human race.
The literal interpretation of the Maya concept of a World Age shift in 2012 is
emphasized by many writers for the sheer drama of it. In this scenario, humanity
literally is going to experience cataclysm and upheaval, earthquakes, disasters, fam¬
ine, and plague. This Earth cleansing, however, is the prelude for a global renewal.
While this scenario may seem bleak, the Maya doctrine of World Ages extends back
over four previous epochs, each of which ended in cataclysm and the transforma¬
tion of humanity into something completely new, a new being better suited for life
in the new world. So even in this catastrophic scenario, the cyclic renewal of the
Earth and the spiritual unfoldment of humanity prevail.
With so many questions still unanswered, I continued trying to satisfy my
thirst for understanding the true meaning of the Maya end-date. Two consider¬
ations led me to see the end-date in a larger context. First, Western astrologers, that
is, astrologers who specialize in non-Maya astrology, are saying that we are enter¬
ing the Age of Aquarius, that a new World Age is, indeed, about to begin. A concept
that originated in ancient Greek and Egyptian science, the "shifting of the ages" is
based in an astronomical phenomenon called the precession of the equinoxes. The
precession of the equinoxes, or simply precession, is caused by the fact that Earth
wobbles on its axis. Earth spins on its axis once every twenty-four hours, resulting
in the sunrise and sunset that define our day. However, the Earth, like a spinning
top, also slowly wobbles or "precesses" on its axis. According to modern astro¬
nomical calculations, one full "wobble" (one full precessional cycle) takes about
25,800 years. For observers on Earth, this wobbling gives the impression that the
sun rises against the background of different constellations as the centuries elapse.
The result is that the equinox sun will soon be rising in the constellation of Aquarius
rather than in Pisces, as it has for the past 2,000 years. Thus, we are moving out of
the Age of Pisces and into the Age of Aquarius. Precession seemed to provide the



XXXVI / MAYA COSMOG E N E S I S 2012
''big event" I was looking for. I wondered if the Maya astronomers recognized the
same twelve constellations that Western astrologers do, and if the Long Count cal¬
endar end-date marks our passage into the Aquarian Age.
The second consideration that emerged in my research also points to preces¬
sion as being associated with the Long Count calendar. As already mentioned, the
cycle that ends in a.d. 2012 is a period of 13 baktuns. A baktun is the fifth-place
value in the base-twenty Long Count calendar, and it equals 144,000 days. Thirteen
of these baktuns equal a 5,125-year "Great Cycle." Maya and Aztec documents
relate a belief in four or five World Ages, and we currently live in the last one.
Amazingly, five Great Cycles equal one precessional cycle! Early on in my research
I thought the Maya end-date simply reflected our movement into the Age of
Aquarius. However, as I searched deeper into the Maya wisdom I learned that an¬
cient Maya astronomers looked at the heavens differently than their Western coun¬
terparts in Greece: They used thirteen constellations rather than twelve. This fact
would result in a different timing for the anticipated shift in World Ages, one that
would not agree with the dawn of the Aquarian Age recognized in Western astrol¬
ogy. I had to rule out the dawning of the Age of Aquarius as an explanation for the
Maya end-date in 2012. Besides, most modern astrologers were putting off the ad¬
vent of the Aquarian Age until the twenty-third century—over 200 years after the
Maya end-date! Something else seemed to be going on, something involving preces¬
sion but that was alien to the Western assumptions I was encountering in my read¬
ings.
I reformulated my guiding question: What event in the cycle of precession
does 2012 represent? As fate would have it, the right book appeared before me at
the right time. The year was 1993. The book was Hamlet’s Mill. Authored by two
respected scholars, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Giorgio de
Santillana and University of Frankfurt history of science professor Hertha von
Dechend, Hamlet’s Mill turned out to be a treasure trove of ideas. The book's sub¬
heading says a lot about its contents: "An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time."
The "frame of time" refers to the celestial frame—the contents of the sky, includ¬
ing the stars, constellations, and the Milky Way. Our orientation to this "stellar
frame" changes over time with precession. Myth is involved because the authors
identify descriptions of this slow shifting of the sky in ancient myths from cultures
around the globe. The basic premise of the book, then, is that myth and astronomy
go hand in hand, that myth describes astronomical processes and, more specifi



INTRODUCTION: FIXING OUR SIGHTS / XXXVII
cally, that ancient cultures were aware of the precession of the equinoxes. More¬
over, the authors contend that ancient cultures believed precession to have a pri¬
mary influence on the changing destinies of humankind.
As mentioned, precession is usually tracked with the changing constellations
in which the equinox sun rises. In Western astrology, there are twelve constella¬
tions, and thus each "constellation age" lasts about 2,160 years. However, the au¬
thors of Hamlet’s Mill also noted that, during the precessional cycle, the equinox
and solstice suns periodically line up with the Milky Way—the band of stars we see
arching through the night sky that is also our home galaxy. One direct clue in
Hamlet’s Mill jumped out at me, and pointed me in a promising direction. The
authors wrote that some 6,400 years ago (4400 b.c.), the fall equinox sun coincided
with the Milky Way, and this was the fabled Golden Age found in many myths. In
other words, this was a time when the sun, on the fall equinox, was in conjunction
with the Milky Way, an era when a harmonious alignment existed in the sky. Of
course, precession eventually caused this alignment to end, fostering a kind of ce¬
lestial disharmony. Imagine how our ancient ancestors would have responded to
this ever-increasing cosmic disharmony. The authors suggest this "untuning of the
sky" resulted in our descent into history, with its increasing wars and fading memo¬
ries of an ancient paradise in which cosmic harmony prevailed. Historically, the
ancient paradise may be a collective memory of the Great Mother-worshiping cul¬
ture of our Neolithic ancestors, in which the ideal of partnership and peaceful coex¬
istence reigned. Moreover, 4400 b.c. does match up pretty well with when partner¬
ship culture was disrupted and a patriarchal system based upon hierarchies of domi¬
nance began arising in the Middle East—the forerunner of our own Western Tradi¬
tion.
Interestingly, Santillana and von Dechend also discuss the ancient myths that
relate a belief in a future time when cosmic harmony would return and an earthly
paradise would resurface. In 1993, I began to carefully think through the implica¬
tions of these ideas. If the fall equinox sun conjuncting the Milky Way was consid¬
ered to be a precessional era of harmony, and a future return of this type of align¬
ment was projected, what could it be? Well, the astronomical fact is that the align¬
ment described above occurred some 6,400 years ago. Since the equinoxes and sol¬
stices divide the year into quarters, I reasoned that one-quarter of a precessional
cycle later (6,450 years), the December solstice sun will be joined with the Milky
Way. In other words, the December solstice sun will be conjuncting the bright



XXXVIII / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
band of the Milky Way around the year a.d. 2012! I felt I had found the answer to
my question about the true meaning of the Maya end-date, and quickly sought to
confirm it. I studied star charts and proved to myself that, yes, despite it never
making the morning newspaper headlines, a very rare alignment in the precessional
cycle will occur on the December solstice of a.d. 2012—the end-date of the Maya
calendar! Precession brings one of the seasonal quarters (either the March equinox,
the June solstice, the September equinox, or the December solstice) into alignment
with the Milky Way once every 6,450 years. However, the alignment of 2012 oc¬
curs only once every 25,800 years! Furthermore, the alignment involves the De¬
cember solstice, the traditional "beginning" point of Earth's yearly cycle. Earth
itself, and by extension its citizens, was involved in the alignment. This was cer¬
tainly an event worthy of being recognized by the ancient Maya as a rare World Age
shift. Could it be, I thought to myself, that the ancient Maya knew about preces¬
sion thousands of years ago? And did they understand something about the Milky
Way and our alignment with it that has escaped detection by modern science? My
discovery answered one question but raised a host of others: Where exactly was the
Long Count invented? Is the alignment of 2012 somehow encoded into Maya myths?
Is it discussed in Maya hieroglyphic texts? Is it portrayed on Maya carvings?
If so, how?
I now had the key to understanding the meaning of the Maya end-date, but it
was clear that I was venturing into uncharted territory. I dove further into the aca¬
demic literature, but nothing I read had anything to say about an astronomical
alignment on the 2012 end-date. I felt bewildered because my discovery was not
based on conjecture but was simply making a connection between two facts. First,
the 13-baktun cycle of the Maya Long Count calendar ends on December 21, 2012.
Second, a very rare alignment in the cycle of the precession of the equinoxes culmi¬
nates on that day. Given this compelling "coincidence," in 1994 I asked esteemed
Maya scholar Dennis Tedlock what he thought of it. He replied that he too had
noticed this unusual situation in 2012, but did not know what to make of it. Were
the ancient Maya aware of precession? Did they purposefully fix the end of their
Long Count calendar to a rare alignment in the precessional cycle? If so, how were
they able to accurately calculate the rate of precession? I had the impression that
this train of thought was off limits in academia, that the implications were just too
tantalizing to be credible.
However, I remained undaunted by the silence of the "ivory tower," and by



INTRODUCTION: FIXING OUR SIGHTS / XXXIX
early 1994 I was making progress sorting out the data. I had been studying Maya
cosmology for almost seven years, having published three books on the subject, so
I already had a good understanding of Maya myth, calendrics, and astronomy. I
continued to review pertinent academic studies, looking for connections between
astronomy and Maya myth. I focused my attention on the astronomy associated
with the end-date alignment: the December solstice sun, the Milky Way, and the
stars of Sagittarius and Scorpio. Three facts loomed before me:
• The ecliptic is the path traveled by the sun, moon, and planets through the
sky. Twelve constellations lie along the ecliptic, and the sun passes through
all twelve during the course of one year. The ecliptic crosses over the Milky
Way at a 60° angle near the constellation Sagittarius. As such, it forms a
cross with the Milky Way, and this cosmic cross was called the Sacred Tree
by the ancient Maya.3 (The cross form was also known as the "crossroads.")
Amazingly, the center of this cosmic cross, that is, right where the ecliptic
crosses over the Milky Way, is exactly where the December solstice sun
will be in a.d. 2012. This alignment occurs only once every 25,800 years.
• The Milky Way is observed as a bright, wide band of stars arching through
the sky. In the clear skies of ancient Mesoamerica, many dark, blotchy ar¬
eas could be observed along the Milky Way's length. These are "dark-cloud"
formations caused by interstellar dust. The most prominent of these is called
the "dark-rift" or the "Great Cleft" of the Milky Way. It looks like a dark
road running along the Milky Way, and it points right at the cosmic cross¬
ing point, the center of the Maya Sacred Tree, right where the sun will be in
2012! The Maya called this dark-rift the Black Road, or the Road to the
Underworld. They seem to have imagined it as a portal to another world,
and the December solstice sun can enter it only in a.d. 2012.
• The area of the sky where all of these symbols and celestial objects con¬
verge is the center of our Milky Way Galaxy. This was perhaps the most
astounding thing I discovered. The part of the Milky Way that the Decem¬
ber solstice sun will conjunct is also where the center of our Galaxy (the
Galactic Center) is located. It is the cosmic womb from which new stars are
born, and from which everything in our Galaxy, including humans, came.
It is important to visualize our relationship to the Milky Way. The Milky Way



XL/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
is saucer-shaped and appears to us as a white band of stars. When we look at the
Milky Way in the night sky, we are looking out along the edge of a spinning disk, as
if looking at the edge of a spinning bicycle wheel. If we look away from the center
of this "wheel," we look toward Gemini and Orion, where we gaze into the vast¬
ness of open space outside our Galaxy. The Milky Way is thin and diffuse in this
direction, and we see only wispy strands of white. If we look in the other direction,
however, toward the center of the wheel, at its "axle," we see a plethora of stars and
a rich caldron of creation. Here is the cosmic oven of the Milky Way's center, and
the dark-rift points right to it. The Milky Way is very bright and wide in this area,
as if pregnant, and for this reason, I realized, the Maya recognized it as the womb of
the sky. They considered this bulging area of the Galactic Center to be the cosmic
source and center, the Womb of All.
I was extremely intrigued with what I was finding, and felt I was unlocking
long-lost secrets of Maya cosmology. I had answered my guiding question about
what event in the cycle of precession occurs in a.d. 2012. The answer: a rare con¬
junction of the December solstice sun with the Galactic Center. I published my
initial findings in late 1994.4 Thereafter, I was intensely engaged in tracking down
the answers to the other questions that were popping up. My initial discovery opened
up even more bizarre avenues of inquiry. For example, could the 2012 alignment
cause Earth's poles to shift, resulting in sudden global catastrophe? Could the "field
effects" of our changing relationship to the Milky Way stimulate genetic or spiri¬
tual evolution on Earth? If so, why are these possibilities not recognized in our
supposedly superior Western science? Did the Mayas' focus on the Galactic Center
have anything to do with the fact that astrophysicists have discovered a Black Hole
a possible portal through space and time—located there? It was obvious I had my
work cut out for me, and I determined to look into these mysteries as deeply as I
could.
For two years, 1995 and 1996,1 was immersed in research, obsessed with the
labyrinthine Pandora's Box I had opened. These were very busy and introspective
years, and I felt charged with a mission and full of enthusiasm. Throughout, I had
the obligations of life to attend to, working and paying the bills. Fortunately, I lived
simply and efficiently, and so had time to cosmologize. And I was making progress.
It seemed at times as if mysteries were solved almost by magic. The more I learned,
the better I was able to formulate questions. As soon as I had framed a question
correctly, the answer appeared. Soon, a general theory emerged: The ancient Maya



INTRODUCTION: FIXING OUR SIGHTS / XLI
understood something about the nature of the cosmos and the spiritual evolution
of humanity that has gone unrecognized in our own worldview. This understand¬
ing involves our alignment with the center of our Galaxy, our cosmic center and
source, and identifies a.d. 2012 as a time of tremendous transformation and oppor¬
tunity for spiritual growth, a transition from one World Age to another.
The bottom line of my theory is that the ancient Maya chose the 2012 end
date because this is the date on which occurs a rare alignment of the solstice sun
with the Galactic Center. I tested my theory, corresponded with Maya experts, and
found that by synthesizing recent advances in the fields of archaeology, ethnogra¬
phy (the study of culture), archaeoastronomy (the study of the relationship between
astronomy, archaeology, and cultural beliefs), epigraphy (the study of the Maya hi¬
eroglyphic writing), and iconography (the study of symbols and pictures), I could
strongly support my ideas. Knowing the controversy my work might arouse in the
academic community, I felt compelled to document my arguments so that my theory
could not be dismissed as vague speculation. My self-published book The Center of
Mayan Time presented the case as of early 1995, but more evidence continued to
emerge, until a unified vision of the profound scope of Maya knowledge began to
gel. By early 1997 I finished a magnum opus study—the original version of Maya
Cosmogenesis 2012. It was huge, exhaustive, and covered a broad spectrum of re¬
lated questions. I had identified how the 2012 alignment manifests in the symbol¬
ism of the Maya ballgame, in birthing rituals, and in king accession rites. Further¬
more, I had traced the origins of the Long Count calendar to the little-known site of
Izapa, and decoded its monuments as initiatory devices into a forgotten Galactic
Cosmology. I began to solicit academic commentary on my book, openly inviting
critique, by sending out abstracts to selected scholars. There was little response.
Most of them simply did not have time to comment. However, I remembered that
Robert Bauval, author of The Orion Mystery, had advised me to be persistent.
By this time (mid-1997), I had published over a dozen articles on Maya cosmol¬
ogy and the precession question. Finally, my friend Jim Reed convinced the Institute
of Maya Studies that it would be worth bringing me to Miami to present my pio¬
neering work. The Institute of Maya Studies is associated with the Miami Museum
of Science and Planetarium, and has hosted Maya scholars such as Dennis Tedlock
and Munro Edmonson. I was honored to be invited to present my theory at such a
prestigious venue. I suspected I was on the cutting edge of where the Maya experts
themselves were going and, in the end, my presentation on August 20, 1997, was



XLII / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
well received. It had the feel of a breakthrough, especially in regard to the accep¬
tance of my work by academia.5 Nevertheless, I was not naive, and I knew that it
would take years for an "outsider" like myself to make inroads into Maya scholardom.
I had stormed the Ivory Tower, left my message, and that was enough for now.
Fortunately, around the same time, Barbara Hand Clow, a long-time believer
in my work and copublisher at Bear St Company Publishing, encouraged me to
begin revising the work for publication. The challenge of transforming what was
originally an exercise in academic schematizing into something that is actually
readable has been daunting at times. Many people have helped in this endeavor,
and I am grateful to them. At last I was blessed with an opportunity to share my
discovery with a much larger readership.
My work fits into an emerging trend of independent researchers decoding an¬
cient precessional mysteries. Importantly, there have been many key breakthroughs
in understanding ancient Egyptian cosmology. Jane B. Sellers' The Death of Gods
in Ancient Egypt carefully outlines a compelling argument that certain astronomi¬
cal phenomena, including the precession of the equinoxes, were understood by an¬
cient Egyptian skywatchers. In The Orion Mystery, Robert Bauval and Adrian Gil¬
bert explain how the Great Pyramid of Egypt is a precessional star-clock. Sight
tubes within the pyramid, usually called "air-shafts," point to Sirius, but only dur¬
ing a specific era of precession. In Fingerprints of the Gods, sleuth-scholar Graham
Hancock adds to this discovery by showing that the constellation Leo the Lion was
rising on the vernal equinox at the "Zero Time" of 10,500 b.c. Hancock believes the
lion-like Sphinx may have been the earthly symbol of the constellation Leo. Based
upon this insight, and other evidence that suggests the Sphinx was constructed
much earlier than previously thought, perhaps even during the Egyptian Zero Time,
Hancock suggests that the builders of the Sphinx lived during the astrological Age
of Leo—around 10,500 b.c. The Sphinx then looms as a mute witness to an era of
precession long past, and that suggests precessional knowledge goes back to the
very dawn of human civilization.
The idea that the Egyptians were aware of precession is not new. In compelling
and original studies published in the 1940s and 1950s, many of them stemming
from field observations, Alsatian researcher R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz defined Egypt
as the great parent culture from which Old World wisdom emanated. In his book
Sacred Science, de Lubicz shares the data that led him to conclude that the ancient
Egyptians were aware of the precession of the equinoxes.



INTRODUCTION: FIXING OUR SIGHTS / XLIII
The Babylonians also seem to have been aware of precession. As early as
1906, historian of science J.L.E. Dreyer noted that three Babylonian tablets, each
from a different era, give three different positions for the equinox, proving that
the Babylonian astronomers were aware of precessional movement.6 The Vedic
astronomers of ancient India, according to Vedic scholar David Frawley, were also
aware of precession—a knowledge possibly going back 6,000 years. Moving to the
New World, William Sullivan's book The Secret of the Incas decoded precessional
mysteries in the mythology and beliefs of the Inca in South America. Sullivan's
work is well researched and adds a great deal to our understanding of how preces¬
sional knowledge manifested in the New World. Among independent scholars, at
least, it appears as if there is a genuine revolution astir in how we view prehistoric
peoples.
This revisioning has fought a persistent bias that survives in the assumptions
of scholars as well as laypeople. Were our ancestors primitive, graceless cave dwell¬
ers, unaware of their relationship to the larger cosmos? Or did they gaze into the
night sky with an appreciation for the majesty of it all, possessing insights into
cosmic processes that are now lost to us? The new perspective championed by
many independent thinkers favors the latter view.
For example, Barbara Fland Clow, in her book The Pleiadian Agenda, explores
the deeper implications of the alignment in a.d. 2012. Going beyond strictly Egyp¬
tian or Maya perspectives, her insights into the history and future of our multidi¬
mensional cosmos testify to the deeply profound relationship that humanity has
always had with the cosmos. According to Clow, we are entering a phase of human
spiritual growth with galactic implications. Also taking a larger view of these in¬
triguing ideas are Dennis and Terence McKenna, who in their book The Invisible
Landscape mentioned the eclipse of the Galactic Center by the solstice sun in 2012.
The McKennas arrived at the 2012 date using sources that did not involve the Maya
calendar. This book was an underground classic upon publication in 1975, and was
revised and republished in 1993. The McKennas write that the alignment in 2012
could "implicate the galaxy as a major formative influence upon the structure of
the molecules that maintain and define life."71 can trace my interest in precession
back to my encounter with this book in 1984. The Invisible Landscape and Hamlet s
Mill are the two earliest sources that recognized the impending alignment of the
solstice sun with the Milky Way Galaxy. I outline the history of the discovery of
this idea in Appendix 1.



XLIV / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
Despite the wider implications of this discovery, in my work I focus on how
the precession of the equinoxes was mapped and calibrated among the ancient civi¬
lizations of the New World, specifically in Mesoamerica. What has emerged from
my research is nothing less than the recovery of a lost worldview containing in¬
sights we are just beginning to appreciate. Maya Cosmogenesis 2012 is devoted to
exploring the Mayas' understanding of the 2012 end-date and the philosophy and
cosmology that go with it. I have reconstructed what I term a lost Galactic Cosmol¬
ogy, and I explain its formulation, content, and the mythological language used by
the Maya to encode its meanings. This is a book about cosmogenesis, the creation
of the world. The Maya believed that the world will be reborn, in a sense "re-cre¬
ated," in the year we call 2012. Why did the Maya believe this? Where did this
profound knowledge originate? What does it mean for the world to be "created" in
2012? And what are the implications for us? My book goes deep into previously
unfathomed areas of the ancient Maya mind, and speaks to an event that is right
around the corner. In addition, I offer an interpretation of what this rare cosmic
event portends for those of us who will live through it. I believe, and I suspect that
the Mayas believed, that we are all indispensible participants in the adventure of
cosmogenesis. We cocreate the world, and what looms before us is a great opportu¬
nity for spiritual growth, both individual and planetary.
Maya Cosmogenesis 2012 is divided into five parts, each rigorously unveiling
the archaeological and mythic dimensions of my theory. The text contains the flow
of ideas as described below, as well as end notes. For readers interested in documen¬
tation, the end notes contain citations and more detailed arguments. The appendi¬
ces are more technical still and explore academic considerations that should appeal
more to the Maya specialists. For example, Appendix 5 contains my response to
arguments against my theory that Maya scholars are likely to put forward. Like¬
wise, Appendix 2 is a thorough examination of the academic literature pertaining
to what the ancient Maya knew about precession.
Part I of my book provides a basic orientation to Mesoamerican civilization:
the timeline of its development, its calendars, and its cosmology. Charting time
was a central concern of the Maya, as was "finding the center" of the cosmos.
Driven by a shamanistic interest in knowing the sky, the ancient Mesoamerican
skywatchers discovered the astronomical phenomenon known as the precession of
the equinoxes, and this knowledge was encoded into their Creation mythology. I
introduce the two basic calendar systems used by the Maya and discuss how as



INTRODUCTION: FIXING OUR SIGHTS / XLV
tronomy developed at various Mesoamerican sites, including those of the Olmec,
Zapotec, Toltec, Izapan, and Maya people.
It is my contention that understanding the nature of precession became the
central interest of Mesoamerican shaman-astronomers. They believed that specific
types of alignments in the cycle of precession stimulate evolution for life on Earth.
In my research, I determined that the Toltecs and the Maya devised two different
methods for tracking precession. In other words, two different and competing
cosmologies emerged—one involved the Long Count calendar, with its end-date in
a.d. 2012, and the other involved the New Fire ceremony. The true meaning of
these traditions is reconstructed. Furthermore, I show how the two systems were
merged at Chichen Itza in the ninth century a.d., and how the schism in the Meso¬
american psyche was healed. Thus, Part II encapsulates a "unified Mesoamerican
cosmology" based upon precessional insights discovered by the ancient Maya
skywatchers.
I will show how the Galactic Alignment of a.d. 2012, pinpointed by the Long
Count end-date, was encoded into Maya Creation mythology. The Hero Twin myth
is the original Creation myth of the Maya. In Part III, I reveal the deeper symbolism
of the Hero Twin myth, a symbolism that encodes precessional astronomy. My in¬
terest here is in getting to the heart of how the Maya understood cosmogenesis—the
birth of the world and its rebirth in a.d. 2012. Ultimately, the Maya envisioned the
alignment to occur in 2012 as a union of the Cosmic Mother (the Milky Way) with
First Father (the December solstice sun). Woven into Maya astronomy, mythology,
and cosmology is a profound understanding of Earth's evolving consciousness. As
my conclusions began to gel, I realized that the ancient Maya developed a sophisti¬
cated cosmological paradigm that modern science has yet to recognize.
Part IV is devoted to exploring the little known pre-Maya site of Izapa. Whereas
traditional Maya scholarship interprets Izapa as an important site in the develop¬
ment of pre-Maya and Maya culture, I will reveal it to be the most innovative cen¬
ter of Mesoamerican astronomical, shamanic, calendric, and religious activity. I
will show how ancient Izapa was the ceremonial site where the Galactic Cosmol¬
ogy was discovered. In fact, I believe Izapa to be the location where thousands of
ancient calendar-priests were initiated into Galactic Cosmology. My interpretation
of Izapa's more than fifty carved monuments reveals the highest esoteric secrets of
ancient Maya cosmology.
Finally, I summarize the profound implications of this newly reconstructed



XLVI / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
Galactic Cosmology and take the reader on an initiatory journey around the monu¬
ments of Izapa to reveal the ancient mysteries of Galactic Cosmology, I end with an
understanding of why the Maya calendar ends in 2012, how this knowledge was
built into Maya mythology and institutions, and what it means for us today.
I hope this book will open up new vistas in our understanding of the Maya, and
preserve for the appreciation of future generations the amazing genius of their civi¬
lization. We are just beginning to understand what they knew. The importance of
the foundation principle of this ancient cosmovision—the precession of the equi¬
noxes—must be recognized as having a formative influence on the evolving life of
Earth. And yet, modern science refuses to acknowledge this, and the fact that a rare
Galactic Alignment looms before us has no place in our short-sighted technocracy.
Perhaps our limited sight will be our undoing. We know about precession today,
but, as the authors of Hamlet’s Mill write, "The space-time continuum does not
affect it [precession]. It is by now only a boring complication."8
To the Ancients, precession had the most profound of implications. To their
understanding, it was involved in nothing less than the evolution of life on Earth,
propelling Earth's lifeforms to higher levels of organization and complexity. The
end result is the full unfolding of spirit and consciousness on a planet that began as
molten rock. The Maya understood that whereas the 260-day sacred cycle is our
period of individual gestation, the 26,000-year cycle is our collective gestation
our collective unfolding as a species. Their calendars and myths encode these truths.
Furthermore, 2012 is the Zero Point of the process—the moment of collective spiri¬
tual birth. And how can we say that they are wrong? One thing is for sure, in this
case time will tell. The era of transformation is upon us.
It appears as if a long chapter in human history is coming to a close, one that
began perhaps 13,000 years ago. At the dawn of agriculture in the Paleolithic Age,
human beings began to understand the nature and potential of the yearly cycle.
They discovered planting and harvesting. As their time-concept was enhanced,
they planned for a future barely appreciated by their immediate ancestors, and the
resultant effects on human culture were transformative. The same might be said
for us in regard to our understanding of the larger Galactic Season of precession: If
we can enlarge our space-time concept and appreciate the immanent potential of
this Great Year, the future of the human race might be brighter than we can pres¬
ently imagine. Suffice it to say that we are, in fact, living in the Maya end-times,
and something completely unprecedented does appear to be going on. Maya

Cosmogenesis 2012 endeavors to resurrect and restore the ancient Galactic Cos¬
mology of the Maya. It is a "first reconnaissance" into a profound knowledge that
once flowered in Mesoamerica, and promises to again. According to this ancient
knowledge, a door into the heart of space and time opens in 2012. May we all take
a step forward.

PRECESSION ASTRONOMY
To me the most interesting result of the present investigation is the
fact that, having once started on an unpremeditated course of study,
I found an unsuspected wealth of material and finally attained
one, totally undreamed-of conclusion, concerning the law govern¬
ing the evolution ofreligion and civilization. This leads me to think
that, as I groped in the darkness, searching for light, I unwittingly
struck the key-note of that great universal theme which humanity,
with a growing perception of existing, universal harmony, has ever
been striving to seize and incorporate into their lives.

CHAPTER 1
A TIMELINE OF
MESOAMERICAN CULTURE
B
efore we delve into the Maya period, we need to journey back in time, to the
origins of Mesoamerican civilization. This journey will take us from the humble
beginnings of hunter-gatherers in the Paleolithic to the complex high civilization
of the Maya—and beyond. Eight thousand years ago, the embers of New World
civilization began stirring in Middle America. Nomadic tribes wandered the wide
valleys of what is now Central Mexico, hunting bison and other free-roaming game.
At night, these people tracked the movements of the planets and stars, as their
ancestors had for thousands of years before them. They gave the sun and the moon
names. In fact, they recognized these celestial giants as deities, capable of nurtur¬
ing and guiding life, but also capable of terrible acts of cruelty and destruction. The
sun provided life-giving warmth, but also could be brutally hot. The planets, too,
were observed as celestial wanderers, gods and goddesses sometimes involved in
human affairs, and their motions were carefully charted. The Milky Way stretched
overhead, spanning the horizons, and the river of white light that flowed from its
womb embraced Earth with nurturance attributable only to the Great Mother of
Creation. Even at this early phase in the development of Mesoamerican culture,
the night sky loomed as a cosmic backdrop on which the concerns and questions of
humanity were projected.
As long as six thousand years ago, villages began to form as maize was domes¬
ticated, through selective breeding, from a wild grain. This great accomplishment of
3



4/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
the early Mesoamericans testifies to their innate genius and persistence. The achieve¬
ment of coaxing juicy maize kernels out of teosinte, a skinny wild grain, required
hundreds, if not thousands, of years of ongoing effort—a goal-focused continuity of
effort over many generations. It seems reasonable for us to entertain the possibility
that early skywatchers possessed a similar capacity for persistence and continuous
effort. They could have relayed an accurate accounting of star positions and constel¬
lation lore from the earliest times. The ancient Mesoamerican astronomers even
may have noticed the slow shifting of the stars, the precession of the equinoxes, at a
very early date. The minds of the early Mesoamerican people were sharp, complex,
and endlessly curious. Their vigilant attention to life, to evolving food sources, and
to the stars imbued them with a sense of connection to both Earth and sky.
For the Maya, maize has an ancient mythological association with the origin
of human beings. They believe to this day that the flesh of the first human beings
was made from white maize and yellow maize. Today, maize cannot reseed itself
without the help of human beings. A deep truth about humanity's relationship to
Divinity is hidden within this fact: The Maize Deity—the source of life—needs
human beings to further the ongoing process of life on Earth. The Maize Deity and
human beings are cocreators. Thus, in a very real sense, the birth of New World
civilization can be traced to the domestication of maize. From a mythological view¬
point, the domestication of maize suggests that early cultures in the New World
had entered into a pact with the Maize Deity, a contract that would carry them to
the lofty heights of a sophisticated and complex civilization. The Flute Song of the
Hopi suggests what this contract might have been about:
We we lo lo, We we lo lo
Ah yum tu wa, Na sa vu eh
Sa qua ma na, Ku yea va
Nah tuk se na
There at the center of the universe
Blue Corn Girl came up
Growing and maturing
Beautifully1
This song recalls what seems to be a universally held indigenous idea that
culture is like a beautiful child, growing outward from the center of the universe,
maturing in time. This image also serves as a key to understanding a basic insight
into human nature and time: Our spiritual natures unfold, in time, like flowers.
That ancient people understood this profound truth gives us pause, and makes us
wonder what else they knew. We know that some five thousand years ago the early

corn-farming villages of Mesoamerica were well-organized and planned. They con¬
tained ceremonial centers, religious cults, sacred rulers, and burial mounds. Even
the earliest phases of cultural development in Mesoamerica reveal a sophisticated
and profound level of social ease, scientific capacity, and artistic sensitivity.
THE PRE-CLASSIC PERIOD
A very early culture in Central Mexico centers on the archaeological site of
Cuicuilco. In typical fashion, archaeologists have identified layers of pyramids here,
but they are unclear how far back this center can be dated. An earspool with a
calendar glyph on it, unearthed at Cuicuilco, was dated to 679 b.c.2 Laurette Sejourne,
in her book Burning Water, considers Cuicuilco the precursor to Teotihuacan, the
great Toltec metropolis that arose in the first century a.d. However, Cuicuilco,
which was destroyed by a volcanic eruption, may have been founded as much as
four thousand years ago.
The Olmecs were the first widespread and organized culture in Mexico. Dubbed
the Mesoamerican “mother culture" by Mexican artist and scholar Miguel
Covarrubias, Olmec civilization took root in the Gulf Coast swamps around 1800
b.c. Its origin is somewhat obscure. Some scholars believe that an earlier precedent
for the Olmec can be found in Guerrero state, south
of Mexico City.3 But Olmec sites have been found along
the Pacific coasts of Guatemala and El Salvador, sug¬
gesting a vigorous and expansive empire during the
second millennium b.c. Amazingly, scholars even have
argued, rather convincingly, that the Olmec had trade
links with the Chavin culture in South America.4
The first great Olmec city was San Lorenzo, which
was fully formed by 1200 b.c. This site is in the Olmec
heartland, a swampy and inhospitable region along the
Mexican Gulf Coast stretching from southern Veracruz
east to Campeche. Colossal stone heads were found
here, some of them weighing forty tons, in addition to
over two hundred ceremonial mounds. Strangely, San
Lorenzo was suddenly destroyed by human hands
Diagram 2. Towns of the Olmec around 900 B.C.



A TIMELINE OF MESOAMERICAN CULTURE / 7
La Venta is another important early Olmec site in this region. A cone-shaped
pyramid almost a hundred feet high occupies the central precinct of the city, which
was built on a small island surrounded by swamps. This pyramid is thought to be
Mesoamerica's first large pyramid, built around 1200 b.c., although the structures
at Cuicuilco in Central Mexico may be older. La Venta was a thriving ceremonial
and market center, and even at this early period in Mesoamerican culture, there is
evidence at La Venta of a sophisticated astronomical knowledge. Archaeoastro
nomical investigation has shown that the pyramid at La Venta was intentionally
aligned toward the polar area of the sky and to specific stars in the Big Dipper.5 The
level of precision in these alignments is quite impressive. However, the effects of
precession inevitably caused these alignments to "go out of sync," and the Olmec
astronomers and temple-builders responded by periodically reorienting the pyra¬
mid. Their solution, however, was bound to be temporary, for precession would
once again cause a misalignment between the stars and the pyramid. Nevertheless,
the realignments of La Venta's pyramid provide persuasive evidence that Olmec
astronomers were aware of precession.
As mentioned in the Introduction, precession is caused by the wobbling of
Earth's axis and results in a shifting of the rise times of stars. Many Maya special¬
ists believe that early Mesoamerican cultures such as the Olmec were not sophisti¬
cated enough to notice precession, because it is a very slow phenomenon. How¬
ever, precession causes the rising time of a prominent star such as Spica to shift
about 1° in seventy-two years. One degree actually spans a fairly large amount of
space—consider that the full moon covers one-half of a degree. In the course of only
150 years—a period of time spanning only two or three lifetimes—Spica would
shift very noticeably by the distance of about four full moons! If the Olmec
skywatchers and others were indeed passing astronomical information down from
one generation to another, they could very well, and fairly easily, have tracked
precession. And tracking the rising time of a single, bright star is only one method
early skywatchers may have used to discover precession. At the latitude of La Venta,
the polar area of the sky (specifically, the North Celestial Pole) is very close to the
horizon. Precession affects the rising position of circumpolar stars, and, given La
Venta's precise orientation to the circumpolar stars in the Big Dipper, Olmec as¬
tronomers easily could have tracked precession-caused changes in the rising posi¬
tion of those stars. The pyramid realignments at La Venta make sense only if we
allow that the Olmec were keenly interested in calibrating precession.



8 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2 012
But why should the Ancients' understanding of precession be so important to
us? This is a complicated question, and it will be answered in detail as the book
progresses. Briefly, my research shows that precession was of immense interest to
early Mesoamerican astronomers because it changed their relationship to the heav¬
ens, exerting dramatic effects on evolving humanity. The Maya were interested in
the big picture, and, as sophisticated cosmologists, they endeavored to formulate a
holistic model of time, evolution, and human nature. As often stated in the litera¬
ture, the Maya were obsessed with time. Precession, a cycle of almost 26,000 years,
was the largest astronomical time cycle that the Maya encountered. It thus repre¬
sented to them the most profound of mysteries, and their cosmological sights were
fixed on figuring out what precession meant for human beings. The Maya recog¬
nized that one heavenly object, the Galactic Center, was a key reference point for
precessional change. In other words, we might say that precession shifts our "angu¬
lar" orientation to the Galactic Center, and, as I will show, the Maya believed this
to change—indeed, to intensify—evolutionary potential on Earth.
Ultimately, the discovery of precession gave rise to a Maya doctrine of World
Ages—the Popol Vuh Creation myth—in which Earth and humanity experience
cycles of destruction and re-creation over long periods of time. Anticipating real¬
izations that our own science has yet to make, the Maya understood that preces¬
sion represents a 26,000-year cycle of biological unfolding—a type of spiritual ges¬
tation and birth—that Earth and its consciousness-endowed lifeforms undergo. But
we are getting ahead of ourselves. Let us return to La Venta and the early skywatchers,
for they have more to teach us.
I believe that the evidence at La Venta for the discovery of precession repre¬
sents a watershed event in the development of Mesoamerican cosmology. But how
was this discovery incorporated into Olmec symbology? We can look to the many
artifacts excavated at La Venta to get a sense of the Olmecs' mythological and cos¬
mological preoccupations. The jaguar was the primary animal totem of the Olmec.
The mouth of the jaguar represented the portal to the Underworld, as did terrestrial
caves, where the Olmec priests engaged in shamanistic rituals. Toads, serpents,
and birds also were important features of the Olmecs' shamanistic pantheon. Toads
were the source of a vision-producing drug and also were the earthly animal totem
of the Great Mother Goddess. Attuned to the rhythms of the Earth Mother, toads
croak wildly before it rains, announcing the Earth Mother's water blessing. Snakes
were symbols of rebirth and immortality, because they shed their skin every year

yet do not die. In addition, the snake was also a symbol of the
Milky Way.
Many Olmec artifacts depict human heads with a small
V-shaped cleft in their foreheads. This "cleft-head" motif is
very revealing of Olmec ideas about life, birth, and death.
Sacred maize plants are often shown sprouting from these
clefts, suggesting they represent a type of divine birthplace.
The cleft head, as a divine birthplace, was believed to symbol¬
ize the portal between worlds—the doorway between the realm
of the living and the realm of the dead, an entrance to the
Underworld. The mouth of the jaguar and the cleft head both
symbolize a portal to another realm that is also a birthplace.
Here we begin to see how different mythological symbols can
represent the same underlying concept. When it comes to as¬
tronomical concepts, we will find that many mythological sym¬
bols may refer to the same astronomical object. For example, Mesoamerican think¬
ers mythologized the Milky Way as a snake, a road, a river, a toad, and a Cosmic
Mother. As we will see later, the cleft-head motif is an Olmec symbol that repre¬
sents a very important "cleft-like" feature of the Milky Way—a "birthplace door¬
way" that the December solstice sun will enter on the 2012 end-date.
At La Venta, as at later Mesoamerican cities, mythology and astronomy were
closely related to ideas of political rulership. The emphasis on the relationship be¬
tween the city's central ceremonial precinct and the ruling king-shaman indicates
the presence of sacred kingship at La Venta, an institution central to later Maya
society. The king was typically associated with the highest deity, sometimes the
sun, but, more importantly, he was associated with the center and origin of the
world. This association might take the form of the king's throne being located in
that is, aligned with—the "cosmic center." The Sacred Tree or World Axis was visu¬
alized extending down to Earth from this cosmic center. As the polar orientation of
La Venta's pyramid suggests, the Olmec probably thought of the polar region as the
cosmic center and source. This is not surprising, because the entire sky appears to
revolve around the North Celestial Pole. In addition, the Neolithic ancestors of the
Olmec who migrated into the New World from the far north of Asia worshiped the
Pole Star as the highest deity. This notion survives today in Asia. The symbology
and orientation of the sacred ruler's central palace within the Forbidden City (Beijing,
Diagram 3. The Ol¬
mec cleft-head “birth¬
place” with sprouting
maize



lO / MAYA COSMOG E N E5 I S 2012 , '—' ,
China) reflect an ancient interest in identifying the shaman-ruler with the Pole Star.6
In Mesoamerican symbology, in addition to being associated with the cosmic
center, the king-shaman was also associated with caves. At Chalcatzingo, a late
Olmec site dated to 600 b.c., Monument 1 portrays the sacred ruler, a king-shaman,
sitting in a cave.
Shamanic rites, which were central to Mesoamerican religion, were performed
in caves by calendar priests and probably even by sacred rulers themselves. You
may recall that Maya kings, as shamans, were
responsible for mediating knowledge and power
flowing between Earth and the invisible, other¬
worldly domains. The Mesoamerican king
shaman had a foot in both worlds, and is thus
depicted enthroned in the cosmic cave, the
"portal" between worlds. The cave thus sym¬
bolizes the divine throne, a nexus between
worlds. In later Maya hieroglyphic writing,
caves were indicated by a "cleft-in-hill" glyph,
a symbol corresponding to the Olmec cleft-head
motif.
As mentioned, the
mouth of the jaguar also
represented an entrance
to the Underworld. In addition, temple doorways, cenotes
(sinkholes where water collects), and a woman's birth canal
were all symbolic portals to the Underworld—the realm of
the ancestors.7
Significantly, the Maya of today equate the terrestrial sym¬
bols of the Underworld portal with a specific place in the sky.
The modern Quiche Maya identify the Great Cleft or "dark-rift"
in the Milky Way, which looks like a black road running down
its middle, as the "Road to the Underworld."8 It runs from the
stars of Sagittarius northward along the Milky Way, beyond
the Aquila constellation. The Quiche term for this dark-rift in
the Milky Way is xibalba be (xibalba = underworld; be = road).
They also call it the Black Road. Though it may seem unusual

catzingo: The Olmec king-shaman en¬
throned in a cave



A TIMELINE OF MESOAMERICAN CULTURE / 11
to locate the Road to the Underworld in the sky, the Maya believe that every night
the Underworld rotates above the Earth and becomes the night sky.9 As such, the
dark-rift is the lowest point of the Underworld, but is also the highest point of the
night sky. As we will see, recognition of this astronomical feature is critical to un¬
derstanding the true meaning of the Maya end-date in a.d. 2012.
As the first millennium b.c. drew to a close, both the New World and the Old
World were in transition, with conflicting mythologies and political ideologies bat¬
tling for supremacy. In the Old World, a new paradigm, Christianity, emerged. In
the New World, between 400 b.c. and 100 b.c., a great shift occurred in the flow of
Mesoamerican civilization. The Olmecs had faded. A cultural style that would come
to define the Maya, clearly different from the earlier Olmec tradition, began to
emerge. The Pacific coastal regions of Chiapas and Guatemala saw a brief but im¬
portant upsurge in cultural activity, which centered upon the site of Izapa. Izapa
exerted enormous influence for at least three hundred years (250 b.c. to a.d. 50), and
it was there that the Long Count calendar, with its intriguing 2012 end-date, was
invented.
Over fifty standing carved monuments (stela, pronounced "stee-lah"), altars,
and thrones depict scenes from the Maya Creation myth, the Popol Vuh, otherwise
known as the Hero Twin myth. Dated to the first century b.c., these Izapan monu¬
ments are the first representations of the Hero Twin saga to appear in Mesoamerican
art. Scholars recognize Izapa as an important archaeological site for what it reveals
of Mesoamerica's cultural and political changes, but I came to realize that the knowl¬
edge encoded on Izapa's monuments was more astronomical than anthropological.
I first noticed that the entire site-plan of Izapa was aligned to the December solstice
horizon, suggesting that many of Izapa's monuments may portray astronomical
events occurring in that direction. Izapa's ballcourt is aligned to the December sol¬
stice horizon, and may have represented the Milky Way. Several monuments de¬
pict the rebirth of the First Father solar deity, called One Hunahpu in the Popol
Vuh. Putting the pieces together, I began to suspect that Izapa's monuments offered
a mythic narrative, carved in stone, describing the astronomical alignment charted
by the Long Count calendar.
Another major factor in understanding the role of Izapan culture in the devel¬
opment of sophisticated cosmological ideas involves the discovery nearby of many
"mushroom stones" (ritual stone effigies of hallucinogenic mushrooms), dated to
the era of Izapa's beginnings. The entire Chiapas-Guatemalan Pacific coastal re



gion, with Izapa at the center, apparently was the site of a lengthy experiment in
ritualistic and/or scientific use of hallucinogenic mushrooms around 300 b.c. They
are evidence that the innovative ideas pioneered at Izapa were informed by the use
of psychoactive drugs. As we shall see, an advanced cosmological knowledge emerged
at Izapa, suggesting that the Izapans were not just ahead of their own time, they
were even ahead of ours.
THE CLASSIC PERIOD
The Classic period (200 a.d. - 900 a.d.) refers specifically to the Maya realm.
However, the Teotihuacan-Toltec tradition of Central Mexico (100 a.d. - 750 a.d.)
closely paralleled the ascendancy of Maya civilization. These two traditions nur¬
tured trade and political alliances. Although the Toltecs and Maya spoke different
languages, they shared many basic beliefs about time, nature, and cosmology. The
Maya occupied eastern Mesoamerica and the Toltecs lived some eight hundred ki¬
lometers directly to the west, in Central Mexico. As we will see, variations in
calendrical tradition between these two realms defined a fundamental underlying
difference in their respective conceptualization of World Ages.
Maya civilization has been thoroughly discussed in many popular books.10 Re¬
cent work by archaeologists shows that very early Proto-Classic Maya sites emerged
in the lowlands of the Peten (in northern Guatemala) around 100 b.c. Cerros is one
of them, thought to be a place where the institution of sacred kingship became
standardized. The great Maya cities of Tikal, Uaxactun, and Yaxchilan followed
closely. Palenque, a little further to the west, contains astounding carvings and
hieroglyphic texts, and today is a beautiful place to visit. In the seventh and eighth
centuries a.d., Palenque was ruled by Pacal the Great and his son Chan Bahlum.11
Many of the sanctuaries and buildings found today at Palenque were dedicated by
these rulers. Interestingly, Palenque was ruled by Pacal's mother for a time in the
early seventh century, before he effectively took the throne. Among the Classic
Maya cities of Chiapas and Peten, a unique form of warfare emerged. Scholars call
it Tlaloc-Venus warfare, or "Star Wars," because raiding campaigns were timed by
the movements of Venus.12
The great southern city of the Maya was Copan, which is in present-day Hon¬
duras. William Fash is directing the archaeological project for the Peabody Mu¬
seum at Copan, and many interesting new discoveries have come to light in recent



A TIMELINE OF MESOAMERICAN CULTURE / 13
years. Within the main temple Fash found a sequence of earlier pyramids, built by
successive rulers of Copan between a.d. 430 and a.d. 800. Fash's team painstak¬
ingly reconstructed Copan's ornately sculpted buildings, revealing some of the eso¬
teric facets of Copan's worldview. A dance platform and surrounding buildings de¬
pict episodes from the Popol Vuh story of Hunahpu and Xbalanque, the heroic twin
sons of the First Father solar deity, One Hunahpu. The Hero Twin myth was the
primary element of Copan mystery rites, which included the sacred ballgame, cer¬
emonial dances, plays, and initiations into esoteric knowledge involving astronomi¬
cal cycles. Fash and other researchers report that the iconography and architectural
alignments at Copan reveal an interest in celestial bodies such as the Milky Way,
Venus, and the moon.
Fash recently discovered a stela under the Temple of the Hieroglyphic Stair¬
way dated 9.0.0.0.0 in the Long Count, which supports a founding date for Copan
around the completion of the ninth baktun (December 9, 435). The ruling dynasty
of Copan was founded in a.d. 426 with the accession of Yax-Kuk-Mo'
(Blue-Quetzal-Macaw). A total of sixteen kings descended from Yax-Kuk-Mo' and
ruled Copan for the next four hundred years. The thirteenth successor was a power¬
ful man named Eighteen-Rabbit who, with his predecessor Smoke-Imix, ruled dur¬
ing Copan's zenith, from a.d. 628 to a.d. 738.
Conservation is a high priority for the directors of the Copan project. A virtual
museum housing exact replicas of Copan's sculptures and building faqades is being
built near the site. Copan's progressive educational museum was inaugurated and
opened on July 22, 1996.
In the lowland areas of the Yucatan to the north, in places like Chichen Itza,
Uxmal, Labnah, and Kabah, Maya culture took different forms, especially in regard
to architectural design. These sites are impressive, and reveal that the people who
built them were interested in Venus, the moon, and other astronomical bodies and
events. For example, the Nunnery Complex at Uxmal contains a total of 584 win¬
dows, which is the number of days in a Venus cycle.13 Uxmal also contains an
interesting and unique oval-shaped pyramid, called the Pyramid of the Magician.
Chichen Itza contains the Caracol observatory and the Pyramid of Kukulcan (the
"Castillo"), on which an amazing shadow-play cast by the late afternoon sun can
be viewed every spring equinox. During this celestial "hierophany," the late after¬
noon equinox sun casts a shadow-image of the Maya snake deity Kukulcan against
the balustrade of the north stairway, heralding the return of the life-giving serpent



power and the continuance of life. Since the 1970s, this event has drawn increas¬
ingly large numbers of observers, who witness firsthand the amazing architectural
and astronomical abilities of the ancient Maya. In looking closely at the esoteric
symbology of this event, I discovered an alignment between the sun, the Pleiades,
and the zenith that has until now gone unnoticed. I explore the implications of this
lost cosmology, encoded into the Pyramid of Kukulcan at Chichen Itza, in Part II.
In the ninth century a.d., Maya civilization began to disintegrate. Central au¬
tonomy and control fell apart due to a variety of factors including warfare, environ¬
mental degradation, drought, and diseases. Scholars attribute the Classic Maya col¬
lapse primarily to the proliferation of minor princedoms, each seeking its piece of
the pie. In other words, greed contributed to the Maya downfall, a sobering message
for our own times. By a.d. 950 the former glory of the Maya was no more. However,
the Maya did not simply disappear, as has often been written. Their style of living
changed, and their culture became decentralized, adapting to the effects of the col¬
lapse. In fact, certain Maya areas of Mesoamerica thrived after the collapse.
THE POST-CLASSIC PERIOD
The period between the Maya collapse and the arrival of the Spanish, roughly
a.d. 900 to a.d. 1520, is called the Post-Classic period. Around a.d. 1200 the high¬
lands of Guatemala were colonized by the Quiche and Cakchiquel people, who by
1520 had established an impressive empire. In the Yucatan peninsula, Toltec refu¬
gees from Teotihuacan arrived around a.d. 800, following long-established trade
routes, and inspired a Post-Classic renaissance that we may call hybrid Toltec-Maya.
The east-west cultural division we identified for the Classic era Toltec and Maya
cultures thus shifted to a Post-Classic north-south division in which certain basic
Toltec concepts and beliefs were transferred to the former lowland Maya realm of
the Yucatan, while uniquely Maya traditions were preserved to the south, in Chiapas
and Guatemala. This distinction will be important as we look at the calendric and
cosmological traditions from these different areas, how they were designed to cali¬
brate alignments in the precessional cycle, and how they were synthesized at
Chichen Itza.
The Post-Classic period also saw a flowering of Toltec-derived cultural tradi¬
tions in Central Mexico. By the time of Spanish contact, Mixtec, Huastec, Mazatec,
Aztec, and Zapotec people dominated the cultural scene. These groups lived in the



A TIMELINE OF MESOAMERKAN CULTURE / 15
mountains and wide valleys of Central Mexico, claimed Tollan (probably Teoti
huacan) as their ancestral homeland, and spoke various dialects of the Nahuatl
language. In this way, Toltec traditions continued to grow and had spread as far east
as the Yucatan. As mentioned, the Quiche and Cakchiquel Maya settled areas of
the Guatemalan highlands in the Post-Classic period. The Quiche capital was at
Kumarcaaj (near present-day Santa Cruz del Quiche). Kumarcaaj became known as
Utatlan, and detailed dynastic histories of the Quiche are preserved in the Popol
Vuh and various colonial documents.14 After Spanish contact and a dramatic battle
between conquistador Pedro Alvarado and the Quiche leader Tecun Uman, in which
Tecun Uman was killed, the Spanish established and administered a new capital at
Iximche. Today the Quiche are a vital people, despite being marginalized and perse¬
cuted by the Guatemalan government.
With all the intercultural activity in the Post-Classic Yucatan, Chichen Itza
and its sister city Mayapan experienced a series of political intrigues. Mayapan was
founded in the tenth century a.d., and eventually formed a triple alliance with
Uxmal and Chichen Itza, called the League of Mayapan. These three strong cities
were to exert equal power, but from the beginning Mayapan sought sole control.
While peace lasted, the land prospered, art flourished, and architecture soared. Even¬
tually, because of the treachery of Hunnan Ceel, leader of Mayapan, the league
erupted into civil war. The Itzas warred with Mayapan, but Hunnan Ceel brought
in Mexican-Toltec allies and defeated the Itza. The Xiu lineage began at this time,
and is traceable up to the present day. In the 1450s Mayapan was utterly destroyed.
All the Xiu nobility were killed except for one son, Tutul Xiu, who happened to be
away at the time. Tutul Xiu reestablished his lineage at nearby Mani, and when the
Spanish arrived, he was ruling that province.
THE POST-CONTACT
After contact with European invaders lusting after gold, Mesoamerica was radi¬
cally changed. This period was nothing short of a holocaust for indigenous peoples,
many dying of disease and many others subjected to a quick journey into Christian
hellfire by way of torture and dismemberment. Many material artifacts of Maya
culture and genius were destroyed at this time. As documented in recent ethno¬
graphic studies, it is miraculous that many indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica
have been able to preserve their traditions to the present day. The highland Maya in



16/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
particular have continued to follow many central traditions of the ancient Maya
religion, including the 260-day sacred calendar. In fact, they preserve the ancient
Classic-period placement of the 260-day calendar, itself based upon the earlier Olmec
placement, indicating a Mesoamerican continuity of calendar tradition extending
over 3,000 years.15 In comparison, the continuity of tradition in Central Mexico
and in lowland Yucatan, areas subjected to greater persecution, has not fared so
well. In Mexico, Maya tradition is preserved to a large extent in the highlands of
Chiapas, and in Tzotzil and Tzeltal towns such as San Larrainzar, Chamula, and
Zinacantan. But recent events in Guatemala and Chiapas have devastated tradi¬
tional Maya culture. Probably more disruption and destruction of Maya culture has
taken place since 1970 than in the last three hundred years. Sadly, these events
result from our movement into a type of transnational feudalism driven by Wall
Street and other U.S. money-engines. In other quarters, observers report a healthy
resurgence of Maya culture and an avid interest among young Maya in their own
history and cultural identity.16
The epic span of Mesoamerican history is impressive, reminding us that here,
in this "new" continent, a self-sufficient and vital civilization once lived. The de¬
scendants of this civilization are still with us, and we can learn much by listening
to them and studying their culture. Mesoamerican civilization pioneered many
original traditions, a complex hieroglyphic writing system, and brilliant cosmo
conceptions not found elsewhere in the world. The unique calendar systems devel¬
oped in Mesoamerica most clearly testify to the genius of Mesoamerican thinkers,
who wove together mythology, political organization, religion, and astronomy into
one seamless whole. As the true implications of ancient Maya cosmology resur¬
face, the renaissance of indigenous cultures should be stimulated even further. The
year 2012 may be a rallying cry for the modern Maya to understand and reclaim the
greatness of their peoples' past achievements.

C
alendars were, and still are, used by the Maya to map and structure various
aspects of human experience, from agricultural activities to observed cycles
in the sky. The 260-day Mesoamerican calendar is used for both of these purposes,
and this is where its greatest function can be found—it unites the processes of
heaven and earth. The Nahuatl-speaking people of Central Mexico called the 260
day cycle the tonalpohualli (the book of days). Among the Maya people and aca¬
demic specialists, it became known as the tzolkin.1 In this book I will refer to it as
the tzolkin or the sacred cycle. The tzolkin consists of twenty day-signs combined
with a number from one to thirteen, thus creating a total of 260 unique units. The
day-signs and numbers of the tzolkin are counted alongside each other, the same
way our own month days and weekday names are tracked. For example, we would
say for the month of April 1998 that Wednesday the 1st is followed by Thursday the
2nd, Friday the 3rd, and so on. The day name and the number click off simulta¬
neously. Likewise, April 1, 1998, was 8 Iq' in the Quiche Maya tzolkin calendar,
followed by 9 Aq'ab'al, 10 K'at, and so on. The combined cycles of thirteen and
twenty make the tzolkin a mystical "time tool" for those who count it and track
life events by its rhythms. Contemporary Quiche Maya daykeepers name the days
as follows:2

Significantly, the modern Quiche Maya follow the same placement of the
tzolkin (its location in real time) as did their Classic-period ancestors. In other
words, a continuity of tradition has reached through the centuries, undisturbed by
the Classic-period collapse and the ravages of the Conquest. This survival reveals
how durable the Maya calendar is, and makes us wonder how much else of the
ancient knowledge still survives in the remote villages of Central America.
The tzolkin has many rich and varied uses. In the 1970s, Quiche calendar
priest Andres Xiioj told ethnographers that the tzolkin's origin was based upon the
nine-month period of human gestation. A period of 260 days very closely approxi¬
mates the interval between when a woman first stops menstruating and her child is
born. Maya midwives to this day calculate birth dates with the tzolkin. Maya
daykeepers—those who follow the tzolkin—believe the day on which a child is
born within the 260-day cycle determines personality characteristics. In this way,
the tzolkin serves as an astrological oracle—a "book" that reveals a person's weak¬
nesses and virtues.
The tzolkin calendar also is used in divination. Contemporary Quiche Maya
calendar-priests in highland Guatemala use the tzolkin to answer questions for



CALENDRICS: MAPPING METHODS / 19
clients, such as the location of a stolen object, the wisdom of entering into a busi¬
ness deal, or marriage prospects. In addition to these magical properties, the 260
day sacred calendar also has astronomical uses. Because two tzolkin periods (520
days) equal three eclipse half-years (during which exactly three eclipses will oc¬
cur), the tzolkin was used to predict eclipses. Through the tzolkin's many uses we
see how Maya cosmovision weaves together biological Earth cycles (human gesta¬
tion) and celestial sky cycles (eclipses). This parallelism reveals a fundamental
principle recognized by the Maya, also acknowledged in Western mystery reli¬
gions: as above, so below. Long ago, the Maya intuited that celestial cycles harmo¬
niously reflect cycles on Earth. These Maya insights into the organizational ten¬
dencies of nature, what we might call an indigenous holographic paradigm, can be
traced back at least to the invention of the tzolkin calendar, to the Olmec roughly
3,000 years ago.
As already mentioned, thirteen and twenty are the key numbers of the tzolkin,
the "building blocks" of Maya time philosophy. Thirteen refers to the waxing phase
of the moon—its new-to-full phase. Although one-half of a lunar phase-cycle math¬
ematically equals 14.8 days rather than 13, the Maya placed greater importance on
actual observations. The moon reappears as a sliver in the western skies one day
after "moon dark" (the day on which the moon is too close to the sun to be seen).
Likewise, for all observational purposes the full moon can be observed for at least
two days. Thus, the count from new appearance to fullness is thirteen days. The
number twenty refers to a human being's twenty fingers and toes, and also to the
twenty-day uinal period of the Long Count calendar. In fact, the Maya words for
"person" (uinac) and "month" [uinal] are similar. The 260-day tzolkin calendar is
thus an ingenious multivalued "cosmic key," uniting human, agricultural, and as¬
tronomical cycles.3
The yearly cycle of the sun, known to the Maya as the haab (the "cycle of
rains"), approximates the 365.2422-day solar year to 365 days. Probably one of the
first astronomical cycles tracked by early Mesoamerican farmers, the haab consists
of eighteen months of twenty days each, with a five-day "extra" month at the end.
The haab is called a secular calendar because it was used primarily to time mun¬
dane agricultural activities, such as the planting and harvesting of maize. The tzolkin
and haab were tracked simultaneously, each scheduling its own ritual or agricul¬
tural agenda. According to Maya scholar Munro Edmonson, the Olmec were using
both the "sacred" tzolkin calendar and the "secular" haab by the seventh century



20/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
b.c. Thus, these two basic Mesoamerican calendars were in place even before the
Long Count calendar was invented.
THE CALENDAR ROUND
Combined, the tzolkin-haab system defines a cycle of just under fifty-two years,
called the Calendar Round.4 Some scholars have dubbed this period the Maya or
Aztec “century," but to eliminate confusion caused by forcing indigenous concepts
through Western filters, I prefer the terms Cal¬
endar Round or the tzolkin-haab calendar, both
of which I will use in this book.
As with our own yearly cycle, the first day
of the haab was thought of as New Year's Day.
When the haab is combined with the tzolkin,
four day-signs of the tzolkin are highlighted as
being very important, because they are the only
day-signs on which New Year's Day (in the
haab) can fall. This fact arises from the math¬
ematical dynamics of the two combined cycles.
In the Quiche calendar still in use, these spe¬
cial day-signs, called "year-bearers," are Kej
(Deer), Eb (Tooth), N’oj (Thought) and Iq (Wind).5
Refer to the table of day-signs given on pages
17 and 18 to see how these four year-bearers
are each five days apart. When you place the twenty day-signs in a circle, the four
year-bearers quarter the circle.
In Maya cosmo-conception, the year-bearers were associated with the four sa¬
cred mountains of the four directions, as well as the four seasonal quarters (the two
equinoxes and the two solstices). As such, a direction, a sacred mountain, and a
seasonal quarter are associated with each year-bearer. This will be important to
remember when we explore the calendric and mythological identity of the Decem¬
ber solstice sun.
As mentioned, the Calendar Round of roughly fifty-two years is derived from
the large cycle resulting from combining the tzolkin and the haab calendars. The
ancient Maya used it, as did their Toltec cousins in Central Mexico. The later Az

tecs also adopted the Calendar Round, and adhered to its esoteric meaning as a
World Age calendar that was defined by the earlier Toltecs. The importance of this
Calendar Round cycle to the Toltecs and the Aztecs is related to their concept of
World Ages. In the Toltec-Aztec New Fire ceremony, the end of the world was
expected to occur at the end of a Calendar Round, but only if the Pleiades failed to
pass through the zenith (the exact center of the sky overhead) on the appropriate
night. The zenith is an important feature of this World Age doctrine, and in my
work to reconstruct Mesoamerican cosmology I determined that both the Calendar
Round and the New Fire tradition were used to track precession. I will have a lot
more to say about this in Part II. For now it is important to understand that the
tzolkin-haab framework, the Calendar Round, was only one method used by Meso¬
american skywatchers to structure their expectations of future World Age shifts.
The second major tracking method, or calendar of World Ages, is the Maya Long
Count calendar.
THE LONG COUNT: THE GALACTIC CALENDAR
The ancient pre-Maya skywatchers of Mesoamerica created a sophisticated
system of timekeeping known as the Long Count calendar. Long Count dates first
start appearing in the archaeological record in the first century b.c., although the
Long Count's formulation may have been in process for hundreds of years prior to
that. The Long Count system is based upon nested cycles of days multiplied at each
level by that key Maya number, twenty:
NUMBER OF DAYS TERM
1 kin (day)
20 uinal
360 tun
7,200 katun
144,000 baktun
Notice, however, that the only exception to multiplying by twenty is at the
tun level, where, in order to approximate the solar year, the uinal period is instead
multiplied by 18 to make the 360-day tun. The Maya employed this counting sys¬
tem to track an unbroken sequence of days from the time it was inaugurated.



22 / MAYA COSMOGE-NESIS 2012
Munro Edmonson believes that the Long Count was put in place around 355 b.c.6
However, the oldest Long Count date as yet found corresponds to 37 b.c. Of course,
the Long Count may have been recorded on perishable materials for a long time
before it began to be recorded in stone, but a conservative appraisal of the evi¬
dence, incorporating the archaeological, calendric, and ethnohistoric material,
strongly suggests that the Long Count began to be officially counted in the first
century b.c. Given that the Long Count appears to have been designed to calibrate
precession, an endeavor that may have taken hundreds of years of astronomical
observations to perfect, it is probably safe to say that the Long Count calendar was
being perfected between 400 b.c. and 100 b.c., and was inaugurated in the first
century b.c.
Although the Long Count calendar can be extended beyond the 13-baktun end
date, and, indeed, huge Long Count numbers have been identified in Maya codices
and elsewhere, 13 baktuns is recorded on Maya monuments as the great Creation
cycle of World Ages. We know this because Classic-period Maya Creation monu¬
ments record the end of the last Creation cycle, over 5,000 years ago, as the end of
the thirteenth baktun. Furthermore, we find most Long Count dates in the archaeo¬
logical record beginning with the fifth place value, the baktun.
Modern notation separates Long Count place values with a dot. For example,
6.19.19.0.0 equals 6 baktuns, 19 katuns, 19 tuns, 0 uinals, and 0 days. As can be
seen in the chart given above, each baktun has 144,000 days, each katun has 7,200
days, and so on. If we add up all the values, we find that 6.19.19.0.0 indicates that a
total of 1,007,640 days has elapsed since the Zero Date of 0.0.0.0.0. The much
discussed 13-baktun cycle is completed 1,872,000 days (13 baktuns) after 0.0.0.0.0.
This period of time is the so-called Maya "Great Cycle" of the Long Count and
equals 5,125.36 years. The Maya conceived of the Great Cycle as one World Age,
one growth cycle, at the end of which humanity reaches the next stage in its spiri¬
tual development. As the life of an individual goes through distinct stages, so too
the collective lifewave of humanity grows through several distinct phases. These
"phases" are the five World Ages, or "Suns," spoken of in Mesoamerican mythol¬
ogy. Furthermore, thirteen baktuns reflect the thirteen numbers of the tzolkin,
which, as we saw earlier, represent the new-to-full process of the moon. As such,
the microcycle of the moon's unfolding parallels the macrocycle of 5,125 years
the seed-to-flower cycle operative on the level of human civilization.
Thus, according to Maya calendric science, the Great Cycle times our coilec

tive unfolding as a species, as well as the cycles of culture. But how are we to relate
the 5,125-year Great Cycle to a time frame we can understand? When did it begin,
and why? How does the Long Count relate to our Gregorian calendar?
The problem of correlating the Maya calendar with the Judeo-Christian
Gregorian calendar has intrigued scholars for a hundred years. The standard ques¬
tion became: What does 0.0.0.0.0 (the Long Count "beginning" date) equal in the
Judeo-Christian Gregorian calendar? When this question is answered, archaeologi¬
cal inscriptions can be put into their proper historical context and the end-date of
the 13-baktun World Age cycle can be calculated. By 1950, after years of consider¬
ing data from varied fields such as astronomy, ethnography, archaeology, and ico¬
nography, scholars determined that 0.0.0.0.0 corresponded to August 11, 3114 b.c.
in our Gregorian calendar. This "correlation" became known as the GMT, named
after the three scholars who contributed to its reconstruction: Joseph T. Goodman,
Juan Martinez Hernandez, and J. Eric S. Thompson. The GMT correlation deter¬
mines that the Long Count end-date of 13.0.0.0.0 is December 21, 2012.7 Signifi¬
cantly, of all proposed correlations, the GMT is the only one validated by both
carbon-14 dating and the fact that it is synchronized with the surviving Quiche
Maya count.
The Maya used Long Count katun periods, each lasting about twenty years, to
celebrate significant junctures in a king's reign. Some kings ruled for two or more
full katuns, a measure of stature and success. But these katun intervals are relative
to when the king took office. Katun shifts in the Long Count are really determined
by the fixed beginning date, similar to our own unavoidable decade-ending or cen¬
tury-ending transitions. Katun endings were sometimes celebrated with the smash¬
ing of stelae and sculpture, a symbolic gesture of a new beginning. Baktun endings,
coming every 394 years, were especially important to the Maya, because they marked
the end of a large cycle of time. A baktun ending occurred in a.d. 830, just as the
Maya civilization started disintegrating. Some scholars have suggested that the Maya
collapse was in part caused by a type of self-fulfilling apocalypse.8 In the same way
that an impending katun ending stimulated anticipation and fears about letting go
of the old cycle and its concerns, the larger baktun-cycle ending catalyzed even
greater fervor, excitement, and end-of-the-world fears. Remember, the Maya con¬
sidered the end of the full 13-baktun cycle to herald a major World Age shift. But up
until now no one has correctly identified and explored the reason for this belief. As
my work shows, the fact is that a rare astronomical alignment in the cycle of pre



24/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
cession is due to occur in a.d. 2012, and the Maya knew of it and understood its
implications.
I have come to understand the Calendar Round and the Long Count calendars
as precession-tracking tools, but each system uses a different methodology. While
the Calendar Round was the unit of World Age calculation for the Toltecs and
Aztecs of Central Mexico, for the Maya the unit was the katuns and baktuns of the
Long Count. The important concept in the Long Count calendar for understanding
how World Ages were tracked involves the position of the sun on the end-date and
the "cosmic center" marked by the Maya Sacred Tree. As Maya scholar Linda Scheie
has shown, the four-directional Maya Sacred Tree is the cosmic crossroads formed
by the Milky Way and the ecliptic (the path followed by the planets, moon, and
sun).9 As already mentioned, the astounding property of the Long Count end-date,
revealing how it structures World Ages, is the simple fact that the December sol¬
stice sun will be in conjunction with the center of this Sacred Tree on the Long
Count end-date. This convergence is caused by the precession of the equinoxes,
and defines a rare "alignment era" in the cycle of precession. Given that the Sacred
Tree also targets the Galactic Center within its crosshairs, I began to call the Long
Count the Galactic Calendar. Furthermore, I termed the complex of ideas associ¬
ated with the mythology and astronomy of the Long Count end-date the Galactic
Cosmology.
The implications of the Long Count calendar were mind-boggling. However, as
I reconstructed the lost precession astronomy of Mesoamerica, it became clear to
me that the Toltecs recognized and tracked, with the Calendar Round and the New
Fire ceremony, a precessional alignment that was different from the one tracked by
the Maya with the Long Count calendar. Although this new discovery threatened to
complicate my thesis, I could not ignore it. Since the Toltec system involved a rare
alignment in the zenith, I termed it the Zenith Cosmology. Ultimately, I discovered
that both methods were unified at Chichen Itza in the ninth century a.d., and, amaz¬
ingly, both astronomical alignments will occur in the early twenty-first century,
thus mutually supporting each other. Here we catch a glimpse of the profound eso¬
teric content of Mesoamerican cosmology, perspectives that are just beginning to
come into view. My pioneering reconstruction of this lost cosmology opens up a
greater appreciation for the true scope of ancient Mesoamerican science and reli¬
gion. As a.d. 2012 approaches, a hidden knowledge is bursting forth, ready to be
recognized and integrated into a world dying for new life. And, perhaps, a last chance.



CALENDRICS: MAPPING METHODS / 25
A critical component of the two methods for tracking precession that I discov¬
ered and will explore more deeply in Part II is the concept of the "cosmic center."
As will become clear, Mesoamerican skywatchers tracked alignments in preces¬
sion in relation to a chosen cosmic center. But which cosmic center? Was it the
North Celestial Pole that, as we saw earlier, was of interest to the Olmec at La
Venta? Was it the zenith center (the exact center of the sky overhead) recognized in
the Toltec-Aztec New Fire ceremony? Or did Mesoamerican skywatchers place pri¬
mary significance on the Galactic Center? If so, what evidence is there for such a
thesis?
The cosmic center is a significant, overarching concept in Mesoamerican cos¬
mology. Finding the center was important not only to Mesoamerican skywatchers
but to political leaders, because the cosmic center (also understood as a divine birth¬
place) was the "sacred throne" symbolically occupied by political rulers. Maya kings,
who were really king-shamans, were required to journey into the cosmic center to
retrieve sacred knowledge and the otherworldly power of rulership. But because
the movements of celestial bodies are extremely complex, Mesoamerican
skywatchers ultimately had to entertain three possible cosmic centers. As we shall
see, they determined one to be false, another to be valid but limited to a specific
latitude of observation, and the third to be supreme.

CHAPTER 3
COSMOLOGY: FINDING THE CENTER
W
e have taken a look at the timeline of culture in Mesoamerica and briefly
introduced the role of two different types of World Age calendar systems
invented by Mesoamerican thinkers, the Calendar Round and the Long Count. I
pointed out how the Calendar Round tradition was used primarily by the Toltecs
and the Long Count belonged to the Maya. Another consideration, which will syn¬
thesize some of the ideas we have been discussing, falls under the heading of
cosmovision or cosmology. Cosmology involves knowledge about the world's ori¬
gins and its processes of development. The Maya were attuned to spiritual consid¬
erations, and for them the world's developmental processes must have included
humanity's spiritual unfolding, a process described in their World Age mythology.
The doctrine of World Ages is basically a philosophy of change, an insight into the
nature of time and reality, such that the world is perceived to periodically renew
itself. This insight, which also applies to the ups and downs of human civilization,
is derived from observing nature. Nature is filled with affirmations about the cycles
of time. The seasons wax and wane throughout the year. Birth, growth, death, and
rebirth occur in unending cycles. Likewise, long-range chapters in human develop¬
ment give way, during brief periods of intense change, to a new "era" or "age"
in which different aspects of human nature are emphasized. These are concepts
intrinsic to Maya as well as Buddhist and Hindu religion. In comparison, the
Judeo-Christian worldview espouses a doctrine of linear time, with a distinct be¬
ginning and a distinct, apocalyptic end. What is amazing about the basic tenets of
the Maya worldview is that they are shared by religions currently followed by over
half the planet.

28/ MAYA COSMOG E N E S I S 2012
WORLDMAKING, WORLDGENTERING, WORLDRENEWING
Despite the many varieties of cosmological traditions in Mesoamerica, we can
distill some general universal principles. Following the work of Mesoamerican
scholar David Carrasco, we can identify three basic processes or concerns that
apply to Mesoamerican culture as a whole: worldmaking, worldcentering and
worldrenewing.1 In Mesoamerican thought, the layout and orientation of each city
were understood to be a reflection of the cosmic order. To mirror the important
philosophical concept of a cosmic source and center located in the sky above, the
socio-political realm was ordered by authority emanating from the city center. Like¬
wise, the cosmic center, functioning both on Earth and in the sky, was considered
to be a symbolic birthplace and source of universal order. Worldmaking is the first
act in creating universal order, and in Mesoamerica it was accomplished through
deity sacrifice. The Aztec myth describing the creation of the Fifth Age is a good
illustration of how this happened:
Before the first sun had risen, before the first dawn, the gods assembled them¬
selves at the ceremonial city of Teotihuacan. For four days they performed pen¬
ances around a sacred fire, symbol of the divine center. Their sacrifices were in¬
tended to conjure the world into being. It soon became clear that a very great
sacrifice would be necessary to succeed in such an ambitious endeavor. So, in a
blissful moment of inspired self-sacrifice, two of the deities hurled themselves
into the fire. The gods then halted their rites and looked around for where the sun
would rise, sensing that the immolation might have been enough to create the
dawn. One of the gods, Quetzalcoatl, faced the east, and there, off in the distance,
the sun rose just over the horizon. Thus the world was made through the
self-sacrifice of two deities, through offerings to the central axis mundi. The first
act of cosmogenesis, of creating the world, had been accomplished.
The sun now sat in the east, but there was a problem. It did not move; it just
hovered there. The dawn had come, but the world was going nowhere. The world,
unfortunately, had "no stability, no process, no center."2 In other words, the world
still needed to be centered, something that can only be accomplished in the field of
movement, of time. In the act of worldcentering, the pressing question is: How can
the world "find a pattern, orbit, process?"3 At this unfinished stage, the sun can



COSMOLOGY: FINDING THE CENTER / 29
only remain motionless, hovering, without process. In other words, centering is a
function of time. This point will become important when we look at the evolution
of cosmology after the Olmec era, when a very large time factor—precession—be¬
came undeniable.
Because the worldcentering act can occur only in reference to time, move¬
ment, and process, the Aztec gods had to make a greater sacrifice. In the Aztec
myth, all of the remaining gods sacrificed themselves to set the world in motion.
But Ehecatl, god of wind, was the one who really got things moving. As god of wind,
he sacrificed himself by releasing himself into the world, stirring up a storm to get
things turning. Thus, through a total self-sacrifice of the gods, releasing themselves
fully into their desired creation, the world was set in motion, and time began. Theirs
was an act of centering because time and motion, process, could now keep the
world in balance.
Centering the village, centering the body, centering the sky—in effect, center¬
ing the cosmos on all levels—was a primary concern to Mesoamerican society,
affecting the health and balance of each region's ritual and socio-political exist¬
ence. The astronomical component of this endeavor, finding the center of the sky,
was the province of the calendar-priests and skywatchers. Among the Quiche Maya
these astronomer-priests are callednik’ wakinal, "those who look into the center."
Like the gods of the first time, the modern priests perform sacrifices to keep the
world rolling, to keep time moving forward to its hoped-for, but not inevitable,
recycling at the end of the age.
World rebirth is the third time principle in Mesoamerican thought which, in
Carrasco's model, is called "worldrenewal." As cultural, calendric, and political
eras came to a close, new rituals and myths emerged as creative adaptations to
changing conditions. These were implemented at appropriate intervals in the cy¬
clic calendar. Mesoamerican calendar cycles defined renewal intervals, from daily
renewal to intervals of thirteen days, twenty days, up to the uinal, tun, katun,
baktun, and even larger cycles. These times of calendric recycling told the
Classic-period calendar-priests when to make worldrenewing sacrifices, and included
the ritual destruction of old monuments and the inauguration of new ones.
Both worldmaking and worldrenewal are rooted in the concept of cosmogenesis.
Creation and re-Creation happen in endless cycles, an idea implicit in the
Mesoamerican doctrine of World Ages. Thus, if cosmogenesis (the birth of the cur¬
rent World Age) occurred back in 3114 b.c., then a.d. 2012 represents a new



30/ MAYA COSMOGEN ESIS 2012
cosmogenesis. In short, the Maya believed the world, the cosmos, will be reborn, or
re-created, in a.d. 2012. This is why my book is called Maya Cosmogenesis 2012.
Worldcentering occurs in the field of time, in the phase of universal unfolding
that occurs between Creation (worldmaking) and re-Creation (worldrenewal). In
Mesoamerica, the passage of time was charted with the cyclic motion of astro¬
nomical events.4 Considering the close relationship between time and world¬
centering, only by gaining an understanding of astronomical time cycles could the
Mesoamerican skywatchers approach an understanding of where the true cosmic
center was located. Furthermore, only upon locating the “center" of the world
the celestial center and its earthly counterpart—could the Ancients “anchor" time
and thereby orient themselves to the cosmos in the correct way. In other words, it
was critical for Mesoamerican calendrics and cosmology, as well as socio-political
orientation, to understand cosmic cycles, and this naturally included the preces¬
sion of the equinoxes. In fact, accurately calculating the rate of precession probably
emerged as the greatest enigma for Mesoamerican skywatchers, the solution to
which would define the proper orientation to the cosmos, an orientation necessary
for the well-being of all.
As mentioned earlier, alignments in precession were tracked in relation to the
concept of a cosmic center. We are not talking here about a vague metaphysical
concept. Rather, we are tuning in to the mindset of the ancient Mesoamerican
skywatchers and divining what their interests and goals were; we are talking here
about astronomy. When Mesoamerican astronomers looked up at the cosmic ocean
of the night sky—that vast expanse they believed to be the inverted Underworld
three regions attracted their attention, seductively offering solutions to the cos¬
mic-center mystery. To the north, low on the horizon, they saw the sky revolving
around the North Celestial Pole. This must have been a compelling candidate for
the cosmic center. However, the zenith5 (the exact center of the sky overhead) also
represents a compelling center. In the tropical latitudes, the sun passes through the
zenith at high noon twice a year. Because the exact date of the sun's zenith passage
depends on one's latitude of observation, ambiguity exists in the zenith-as-center
concept. For example, at Chicben Itza the second annual solar zenith passage oc¬
curs on July 26. Hundreds of kilometers to the south, at Copan, the second annual
solar zenith passage takes place on August 13.
The cosmic center was believed to represent not only the center of Creation,
but the source of Creation. The search for the center thus had to somehow satisfy



COSMOLOGY: FINDING THE CENTER / 31
these two criteria. In many Mesoamerican myths, the Great Mother in the sky—the
cosmic birther and source of manifestation—was envisioned as the Milky Way, and
the bright and wide part of the Milky Way near Sagittarius (its "great bulge") pre¬
sents itself as the womb of the sky, the pregnant belly of the Milky Way Mother, the
center and source of Creation. In fact, as mentioned in the Introduction, this area of
the Milky Way is where the Galactic Center is located, which is, in fact, the center
of our Galaxy and the source-point of everything in it. There is ample evidence to
suggest Mesoamericans recognized these three cosmic centers, each of which vied
for recognition as the true Heart of Sky. The Maya skywatchers had a difficult prob¬
lem to solve, one based upon a careful and conscious consideration of these facts.
When were these compelling and sophisticated facts recognized? For example,
when did the Mesoamerican skywatchers discover the zenith concept? When did
they begin to understand the Milky Way as an important axis and its great bulge as
a cosmic source? What evidence do we have that the early Mesoamerican people
were at all interested in these concepts? To answer these questions, we have to do
some historical detective work, and take a look at how cosmology evolved in the
New World. We can begin with the early migrations of Asian people into the New
World, determine what their cosmological ideas were, and then track how ideas
about the center of the sky changed as people migrated southward in the New
World.
THE POLAR GOD GOES SOUTH:
EARLY ASIAN MIGRATIONS INTO THE NEW WORLD
Scholars generally agree that Asian people migrated from the Far North across
the Bering Strait into the New World at various times, depending upon glaciation
that formed land bridges. These migrations probably came in distinct waves sixty,
thirty-five, and ten thousand years ago. Geographer and historian Paul Shao sug¬
gests that more recent migrations from northern China may have occurred along
this route.6 Even trans-Pacific voyages to the New World by ancient Polynesians
cannot be ruled out. Basically, however, people primarily moved from the northern
latitudes eastward and southward into the Americas. These people originated in or
passed through northern China and followed a land route through northeastern
Siberia and Alaska.
Because indigenous cultures in these areas today are intrinsically shamanistic,



32 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
and because Neolithic cultures have been shown to belong to an ancient global
shamanism, we can surmise that the ancient cultures who migrated into the New
World were shamanistic as well. As such, their basic cosmological ideas were prob¬
ably very similar to those surviving today among Siberian tribes and other cultures
in the Far North. Shamans of these groups undertake visionary journeys into the
cosmic center, the Pole Star, to retrieve sacred otherworldly knowledge and pow¬
ers. For them, the North Celestial Pole is believed to be the highest god, the source
and center of existence, as well as their visionary destination. The Pole Star is
recognized as the undeniable cosmic center because, at northern latitudes, it is
very high in the sky and the stars spin around it. In these northern regions, the
zenith-as-center concept does not threaten the Polar God for supremecy because,
outside of the tropical latitudes, the sun never passes through the zenith.
For the shamanistic cultures migrating into the Americas, religious ideas about
journeying to the cosmic center were no doubt very time-resistant. The hazards of
entering new bioregions, the development of migration myths, and the human fears
and worries that accompanied their journeys all required that the shamans retained
a strong link with the Polar God. The concept of the Polar God among these sha¬
manistic people already had a long history, probably extending far back into the
Paleolithic Era. But what happened as these groups moved southward through the
Americas? What happened to their ancient concept of a high Polar Deity as the
cosmic center? Clearly, migrations southward must have had some effect on these
cosmological ideas. The polar area loses its prominence in the Tropics; as you move
further south, the North Celestial Pole gets lower and lower on the horizon. Its
declination (angular distance above the horizon) varies from 0° at the equator to 90°
at the North Pole. (Interestingly, this means that the North Celestial Pole is in the
zenith at the North Pole.) A celestial object's declination always equals the latitude
of observation. So, at the 18°N latitude of La Venta, for instance, the North Celes¬
tial Pole was observed some 18° above the horizon, resulting in a very different sky
than was observed in the Far North. The sky there appears more like a spinning
barrel than a revolving, upward-pointing merry-go-round.
In astronomical terms, the North Celestial Pole is identified by Earth's polar
axis. It is the Earth's axis projected onto the celestial sphere; this is why the stars
appear to revolve around it. The North Celestial Pole is not always occupied by a
star. Precession causes the position of the North Celestial Pole to shift, so some¬
times there is a Pole Star but sometimes there is not. Some 4,600 years ago, the



COSMOLOGY: FINDING THE CENTER / 33
Pole Star was Draco. Currently, it is Polaris. Nevertheless, ancient shaman
skywatchers of the Far North continuously recognized the North Celestial Pole,
whether occupied by a star or not, as the cosmic source and center. That is, they did
until southward migrations threatened the sovereignty of the Polar God with more
complex considerations, namely, precession.
My model is basically this: With human migrations southward into the Ameri¬
cas, cosmological ideas about the cosmic center changed and evolved. The Polar
God went south and was exposed as being an illusion. My model is not without
basis in at least one documented migration legend. In his book Star Trek to Hawa-i’i,
Clyde Hostetter describes the legend of Maui, who lengthened the day in order to
give the Polynesians more time to do their work. Hostetter argues convincingly
that the story of Maui's accomplishment commemorates a time in the ancient past
when a seagoing people followed their leader from northern latitudes to Hawaii, a
land nearer the equator where the days are never short. In a similar fashion, the
Popol Vuh story of the "false" god Seven Macaw, who corresponds with the Big
Dipper, illustrates how Mesoamericans determined the ancient Polar God to be
untrustworthy. The Hero Twins had to shoot Seven Macaw out of his polar perch,
and it is quite clear that this myth reflects astronomy. I will have a lot more to say
about the mytho-astronomical fall of Seven Macaw in Part IV. But for now, let's
continue exploring how Mesoamericans sought to determine the true cosmic cen¬
ter from among the three candidates.
LA VENTA: A POLAR CULT
I believe another example for a latitude-related shift in cosmological orienta¬
tion can be found among the Olmec, at La Venta. There, the ancient interest in the
Polar God was institutionalized, but it fell from grace when the Olmec astronomers
realized that the sky was shifting. As mentioned, at the 18°N latitude of La Venta,
the North Celestial Pole and the circumpolar constellations such as the Big Dipper
and Little Dipper are very low on the northern horizon. The primary axis of La
Venta, including its pyramid, is oriented toward the polar area, 8° west of north.
Mesoamerican scholar Marion Popenoe Hatch wrote an important research paper
on Olmec astronomy at La Venta in which she determined several facts about the
site.7 La Venta's heyday was around 1000 b.c., although Hatch proposes that the
astronomical knowledge that defined the orientation of La Venta probably goes back



34/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
to roughly 2000 b.c. Her theory is based on the posi¬
tion of the stars in the bowl of the Big Dipper and the
''center point" defined by connecting those stars.8
According to Hatch, at midnight on the June sol¬
stice in the 2000 b.c. era of precession, the center point
of the Big Dipper's bowl lay almost precisely on the
north meridian (the vertical line extending from the
horizon through the North Celestial Pole). At this midnight moment, the observer
from the great pyramid at La Venta would see the Pleiades in the eastern sky and
Scorpio setting in the west. Without complicating things too much, we can distill
some basic perspectives from Hatch's findings, which are derived from astronomical
facts. The 8° west of north baseline of La Venta was aligned to the setting point of the
center point of the bowl of the Big Dipper. Around 2000 b.c., Olmec skywatchers had
determined that the Big Dipper's meridian transit as well as its first contact with the
horizon occurred at midnight on the June solstice. In this way, the solar year (of
365.2422 days) was "keyed" to the sidereal year (of 365.25 days).9 The most mundane
result of this "keying" was the timing of agricultural events, festivals, and so on. The
deeper implication, however, arises when we understand that this solstice alignment
of 2000 b.c. would not last forever. Precession is constantly moving stars and constel¬
lations out of their former positions and relationships to the solar year. As a result,
for the Olmec astronomers, the Big Dipper event described above, which was appar¬
ently central to La Venta's ceremonial and cosmological orientation, stopped
occurring on the June solstice. Thus, precession could not have gone unnoticed.
As Hatch reports, in the five hundred years following 1000 b.c., the stars in the
bowl of the Big Dipper underwent complex changes and regressions in their decli¬
nations wrought by precession. The precise rate of change experienced by a star
depends on its celestial location. Circumpolar stars in particular experience rather
strange precessional alterations. In comparison, stars near the ecliptic shift a uni¬
form 1° every 72 years. If these changes were being tracked by Olmec skywatchers,
which, given the facts sketched above, they most certainly were, a great interest in
what was really happening in the sky must have arisen. There is archaeological
evidence that La Venta's pyramid was periodically realigned, probably to account
for the precessional changes that threatened the long-cherished Polar God. These
periodic realignments strongly suggest that the Olmec were trying to get a handle
on the rate of precessional slippage.

the Big Dipper’s bowl stars



COSMOLOGY: FINDING THE CENTER / 35
By 900 b.c., when another prominent Olmec site, San Lorenzo, was destroyed
by human hands, the Olmec must have realized that the polar area was not a stable
cosmic center. In other words, they must have become aware of the precession of
the celestial frame. I believe that this discovery eventually led to the accurate cal¬
culation of the rate of precession, though it may have taken hundreds of years. In
fact, it may not have been fine-tuned enough to be carved in stone until the first
century b.c., when the first monuments dated in the Long Count calendar appear in
the archaeological record. Although by 900 b.c. the Olmec culture was disintegrat¬
ing, for the Olmec shaman-astronomers, and for any skywatcher, esoteric interests
transcended cultural and political vicissitudes. Star knowledge and any high goal of
shamanistic science—such as calculating the rate of precession—would be preserved
and passed down. As we will see, the goal of calculating precession survived in the
skywatching agenda of the Izapans.

MONTE ALBAN AND CAPELLA:
STELLAR SHIFTINGS ANDTHE ZENITH TUBE
The early Olmec were oriented to the Polar Center as a cos¬
mological focal point for ideas about the source and center of the
world. However, as we have just seen, the Olmec eventually real¬
ized this cosmic center to be false. In
terms of empirical correctness, this real¬
ization was a very real scientific break¬
through: The North Celestial Pole is not,
in fact, the center of the sky nor is it the
"source" of the world. Meanwhile, activ¬
ity at another Pre-Classic Mesoamerican
city, Monte Alban, suggests another cos¬
mic center was being examined.
The early Zapotec capital of Monte
Aiban is located on a mountaintop out¬
side of present-day Oaxaca. Most struc¬
tures at Monte Alban are oriented 4° to 8° east of north. Structure f, a strange,
arrow-shaped building, is different. Archaeoastronomers Anthony Aveni and David
Linsley determined that this building loosely points to the setting positions of the
To

five bright stars of the Southern Cross.10 This alignment occurred in the preces
sional era of 250 b.c., when these structures were built. Overall, the loose 3° range
of the alignment is not very impressive. However, Aveni noted another alignment
that yields more interesting results. The perpendicular to Structure J's baseline shoots
through what was an opening or doorway in Structure P, a platform on the other
side of the plaza.
The sight line through the doorway in Structure P points northeast to where
the bright star Capella was seen to rise in the precessional era of 275 b.c. During
this time, Capella made its first reappearance in the predawn sky (its heliacal rise)
on May 8, which is the first solar zenith-passage date at the latitude of Monte Alban.
Solar zenith passages (when the sun passes through the zenith at high noon) were
important indicators of the zenith center and told the Mesoamerican farmer when
the rainy season was about to commence. Solar zenith passages occur only within
the Tropics, that is, between latitudes 23.5°S and 23.5°N. (As mentioned earlier,
and a point important for our discussion of the Zenith Cosmology in Part II, the
precise dates of solar zenith passages depend on one's latitude of observation.)
Amazingly, platform Structure P, through which the Capella observations were
sighted, houses Monte Alban's famous zenith tube. This vertical tube leads into an
underground chamber where zenith-passage measurements of the sun (and stars)
could be made.11 Zenith tubes have been found at other sites, such as Xochicalco in
Central Mexico.
Solar zenith passages were thus no doubt tracked at Monte Alban, demonstrat¬
ing that Zapotec astronomers were interested in a cosmic center that was different
from that of the earlier Olmec, one that is unique to the tropical zone. It seems that
the astronomers of Monte Alban also had abandoned the ancient Polar God and
were looking elsewhere for the true cosmic center. They probably understood that
the zenith center was located in time as well as in space, because solar zenith pas¬
sages occur only twice every year. The solar year (the haab), the tzolkin, and inter¬
vals between zenith passages all contributed to the ancient Mesoamericans' devel¬
oping calendric cosmology. It was the synchronization in time of key points in
these different cycles that would define the center of time and space. However, it
might be better to say that key alignments in large time cycles open the doorway to
the center of spacetime, rather than define that center.
Clearly present in the archaeological study of Monte Alban is evidence for the
realigning of buildings to compensate for precession. This strongly suggests that, as



COSMOLOGY: FINDING THE CENTER / 37
at La Venta, the skywatchers of Monte Alban were at least aware of precession.
Tracking the changing rise times of a star such as Capella would be a good way to
get a handle on the rate of precession. These astronomical phenomena must have
been very important to the ancient astronomers, for they are central to locating the
center of the sky. Apparently there were several centers to contend with, each de¬
pending on one's perspective. Clearly, appearances could be deceiving. The solu¬
tion to finding the true cosmic center required a genius that we can barely appreci¬
ate today and insights into the cosmic order obtained with methods we are only
beginning to understand.
PRECESSIONAL CONSIDERATIONS ATTEOTIHUACAN
Teotihuacan, the great Toltec metropolis where the Fifth Sun was born, also
contains evidence of having been constructed according to an astronomical plan.
Several scholars have argued that an alignment with the Pleiades was responsible
for the founding orientation of Teotihuacan.12 The axis perpendicular to the famous
Street of the Dead pointed to the setting position of the Pleiades. The two "pecked
crosses" that scholars believe were used to lay out the city lie along this axis. The
pecked cross in the group of structures called the Viking Group is just east of the
Street of the Dead, and the Cerro Colorado pecked cross is some distance to the
west.
The significant fact that defined the orientation of Teotihuacan is that, during
the era of Teotihuacan's construction (a.d. 150), the heliacal rise of the Pleiades (the
day of its annual reappearance, rising before the sun) occurred on the first solar
zenith-passage date (May 17 at the latitude of Teotihuacan). In other words, on the
first day of the year that the sun passed through the zenith at high noon—itself a
significant event—the Pleiades made their first reappearance in the east, after hav¬
ing been lost in the sun's rays for some six weeks. Two significant cosmological
events were occurring on the same date: the heliacal rise of the Pleiades and the
solar zenith passage. It is an astronomical fact, however, that the date on which the
Pleiades rise heliacally changes with precession. In time, perhaps as little as one
hundred years, this cosmological "double feature" moved out of sync. Quite sim¬
ply, within one hundred years of Teotihuacan's founding, the Pleiades ceased to
undergo heliacal rise on the May 17 solar zenith-passage date. As a result, the astro¬
nomical mandate that defined Teotihuacan's orientation as a sacred "city of the



38/ MAYA COSMOG E N E S I 5 2012
gods" expired. The Teotihuacan astronomers must have noticed this, and they prob¬
ably began devising ways to track the Pleiades' shifting. As I will show in Part II,
the tradition designed to track the precessional slippage of the Pleiades (toward the
zenith) is none other than the New Fire ceremony.
If, indeed, the quest for finding the true cosmic center is what drove the devel¬
opment of astronomy and cosmology in Mesoamerica, the solution proved to be
problematic, involving as it did the slow shifting of the celestial frame due to pre¬
cession. Astronomer-priests from different times and towns worked with either the
zenith center or the polar center, tirelessly trying to calculate the sky's slippage.
Finally, the skywatchers of Izapa discovered a cosmic center beyond all others, one
that was unassailable. The invention of the Long Count calendar attests to this,
and points to the third cosmic center identified by the ancient skywatchers: the
Galactic Center, the center of our Milky Way Galaxy, and the source and origin of
everything in our Galaxy, including us. For the Mayas, it is located at the center of
the Sacred Tree, the crossing point of the Milky Way and the ecliptic near Sagit¬
tarius. They came to understand the Galactic Center as the true cosmic center, the
Womb of All, which renews the world in a.d. 2012.
COSMIC CENTERS: POLAR, ZENITH, AND GALACTIC
As cosmological thinking became more sophisticated in Mesoamerica, and as
ancient astronomers asked the right questions and sought new answers, so too did
the solution to locating the cosmic center become deeper, more complicated, and
more profound. If we trace this esoteric journey back to the Neolithic Siberian
shamanism from which New World peoples descended, we can understand that the
North Celestial Pole, and its occasional occupant, the Pole Star, was, for Northern
Asian cultures, the obvious choice as the cosmic center. At more northerly lati¬
tudes, the Pole Star is higher up in the sky, causing the stellar dome to spin around
it like a top or a mill, and so they did not have to deal with competing cosmic
centers (such as the sun-in-the-zenith) present farther south in the Tropics. In the
tropical zone, that is, south of Texas and Key West, and certainly at La Venta, the
polar area lies very low in the sky. The celestial dome is less of a dome and more of
a spinning barrel. As a result, the rise and set positions of stars are more pronounced
for the earthbound observer, and stars appear to rise quickly.
One can imagine how, as people migrated south, the esoteric cosmology devel



oped over thousands of years in Asia underwent a strange transformation, a trans¬
formation that, I believe, fully broke forth when astronomers at La Venta confirmed
that the cosmic axis of the polar area was not only not very "high" anymore, but
moved!13 In any case, suddenly time became a factor in the great endeavor of find¬
ing the cosmic center. In the tropical zone, the polar area as a valid cosmic center
must have been disqualified on two counts: It is too low in the sky and it shifts.
Since the North Celestial Pole lies close to the horizon at the latitude of La Venta,
it was easier for skywatchers to notice changes in the rise and set dates of circum¬
polar stars, such as those in the Big Dipper. They could have observed one-day
shifts almost within one lifetime, and because of a star's steep vertical rise within
the Tropics, they could have identified its rising point along the horizon with good
precision. Eventually they would have realized that the circumpolar stars were, for
some reason, shifting position. The Polar God began to reveal his true face: The
Polar God was false!
After San Lorenzo fell around 900 b.c. and Olmec civilization began to wane,
Mesoamerican skywatchers embarked on a fantastic adventure and rose to a great
challenge. Unable to deny the new cosmological knowledge unfolding before them,
they were forced to look elsewhere for a cosmic center, preferably one that could be
tested and trusted. Because the cycle we call precession now factored into their
search, time became a consideration in the quest to find the center. As the Aztec
myth of cosmogenesis described earlier suggests, worldcentering can occur only
when time—movement and process—begins.
We have already seen how the skywatchers at Monte Alban tracked the zenith
passages of the sun. Within the Tropics, the sun passes through the center of the
sky on only two days every year. In this method, time is indeed a factor indicating
the center of space. In this Zenith Cosmology, the zenith is a particularly compel¬
ling cosmic center because it is, quite simply, the exact geometrical center of the
celestial dome overhead. But zenith passages of the sun occur only within the Trop¬
ics. Furthermore, and what complicates the zenith-as-center model, the dates of
solar zenith passages change with latitude. However, solar zenith passages can, in
fact, be used to track precession, if not identify an absolute cosmic center. In fact,
in my research I realized that an important Mesoamerican group, the Toltecs, pur¬
sued and developed the zenith-as-center concept—the Zenith Cosmology. As we
will see in Part II, the Zenith Cosmology resurfaced at Chichen Itza and was en¬
coded into the Pyramid of Kukulcan.



Roughly two hundred years after the zenith tube and Building J at Monte Alban
were built, the Long Count calendar appears in the archaeological record. With this
calendar, and the astronomical alignment that occurs on its end-date, the emerging
Maya (specifically, the Izapans) claimed the prize of identifying the ultimate time
dependent cosmic center. They succeeded in locating the true cosmic birthplace
and celestial throne. Their space-time map, preserved in the fragmented artifacts of
their ancient calendar-science, leads us right into the Galactic Center.
The thread weaving through these cosmic centers is the thread of time. Time
became the primary factor in determining the location of the cosmic center and the
date of worldrenewal. The ultimate time cycle was the precession of the equinoxes,
and precession now looms as a very important factor in understanding Maya
cosmogenesis. What exactly is the precession of the equinoxes? How does it work,
and what do Maya scholars have to say about it? How does it manifest in Maya
myth? An introduction to the Mystery of the Ages is in order.



CHAPTER 4
PRECESSION:
THE MYSTERY OF THE ACES
he idea of periodically shifting World Ages is found in the myths of many
I cultures. Human beings are naturally interested in the vast cycles of time and
the changing seasons of life on Earth. To ancient societies, the sky was understood
to be intimately linked with the changing modes of human culture. Long ago,
skywatchers in many parts of the globe tracked a vast astronomical cycle, and they
believed that this Great Cycle determined transformational eras in human culture.
But there is a great mystery around this topic, almost as if the original story some¬
how got muddled. How far back does this knowledge go? New interpretations of
ancient history are forcing us to accept that our distant ancestors understood the
true astronomical meaning behind the doctrine of World Ages. Thousands of years
ago, people were tuned into the night sky to a depth that we cannot comprehend,
living as most of us do in urban areas that are so polluted as to veil the stars.
Among ancient cultures, and especially in Mesoamerica, the World Age doc¬
trine was a fundamental belief. It engendered an appreciation for the vast nature of
time and a curiosity about the mysteries of ages long gone and soon to come. Among
independent researchers and students of ancient civilizations, it is now becoming
very clear that the Mystery of the Ages is solved in the astronomical fact of the
precession of the equinoxes. Precession changes our relationship to our Milky Way
Galaxy, and ultimately brings us back to the starting point. The Greek philosophy
of the Eternal Return speaks clearly to this obscured source of the World Age doc
41



42 / MAYA C0SM06 E N E S I S 2012
trine, as does Plato's Spindle of Necessity.1 Astronomical cycles, sooner or later, are
always expected to come back around to their "zero" point. The same holds true
for the precession of the equinoxes and, as the Maya knew, the Zero Point arrives in
a.d. 2012.
PRECESSION: THE BASICS
What exactly is precession, and how does it relate to the World Age doctrines
of the Maya and the Toltecs? The precession of the equinoxes, also known as the
Platonic Year and the Great Year, is caused by the slow wobbling of the Earth's axis.
The Earth's wobble causes the position of the equinox sun to slowly precess west¬
ward against the background of stars, thus the term
"the precession of the equinoxes."
Right now the Earth's axis (the North Celestial
Pole) points roughly to Polaris, the Pole Star, but five
thousand years ago the North Celestial Pole pointed
roughly to Alpha Draconis. By a.d. 11,000 the Pole Star
will be Vega. The precessional shift of the equinoxes
applies equally to the solstices. For example, currently
the December solstice point is in the constellation of
Sagittarius. But 2,000 years ago it was in Capricorn.2
Since then, it has precessed backward almost one full
astrological sign. Modern astronomers estimate the full
cycle of precession to be between 25,600 and 26,000
years. The Maya estimate of precession, if we assume
that five Great Cycles (65 baktuns) were intended to
represent a full precessional cycle, is 25,626 years. Since
the end-date of the 13-baktun cycle of the Long Count
calendar identifies a rare alignment in the cycle of pre¬
cession, and Long Count dating first started appearing
in the archaeological record in the first century b.c.,
the ancient skywatchers apparently had already calcu¬
lated precession at that time. Their forward projection, some 2,100 years into the
future, was very accurate and reveals that the ancient skywatchers possessed an
advanced cosmological knowledge.
Diagram 9. The Precession of
the Equinoxes



PRECESSION: THE MYSTERY OF THE ACES / 43
PRECESSION OLD AND NEW
It is commonly thought that the Greek astronomer Hipparchus was the first to
discover precession, in 128 b.c. However, recent books by independent thinkers
who are unfettered by the limitations of scholardom have shown that the ancient
Egyptians were aware of precession.3 Between the era of Egypt's glory and the rise of
Platonic science and astronomy just prior to the Christian era, there was probably a
hiatus in the understanding or appreciation of precessional knowledge. Perhaps
Egyptian Mystery Schools preserved this knowledge up until the time of Pythagoras
and early Greek philosophers. Many early Greek thinkers, including Pythagoras,
were initiated into these Mystery Schools.
It is interesting to note that when Hipparchus rediscovered precession, the
effects on then-current cosmological ideas were dramatic. A world that believed
the stars to be eternally fixed realized that they in fact underwent a slow celestial
shifting. This situation, no doubt unwelcome in some quarters, demanded a radical
rethinking of basic ideas about the cosmos. New ideas also require new explana¬
tory myths, and the mystery cult known as the Mithraic Mysteries is now under¬
stood to have had the revelation of the profound meaning of the precession of the
equinoxes at the center of its most coveted initiatory ceremonies.4 In other words,
the Mithraic Mysteries arose in direct response to the rediscovery of precession, as
a World Age doctrine to describe the vast cycles of cosmic time. It spread through¬
out the civilized world wherever the Romans went, establishing sanctuaries from
North Africa to Scotland. Mithraism competed with early Christianity for future
status as World Religion, and its adherents worshiped one supreme deity—Mithras,
the great architecton who was responsible for the slow shifting of the heavens. In
the Mithraic Mysteries, the slaying of the bull by Mithras, the supreme God of
Time, symbolized the precessional shift out of the Age of Taurus—the death of the
bull god.
In the example of Mithraism, we can see how easily precessional knowledge
lends itself to a World Age mythology. In fact, one begins to suspect that wherever
the World Age doctrine is prominent—as in Mesoamerica—precessional knowl¬
edge is lurking in the shadows. By the end of this book, it will be clear that the
Maya Creation myth, the Popol Vuh, is an esoteric World Age doctrine that arose
with the discovery of precession over 2,100 years ago. Ironically, this apparently
took place in Mesoamerica around the same time as the Hipparchus-Mithras link
emerged in the Old World.



44/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
PRECESSION: FOREGROUND AND BACKGROUND
How did precession look to the ancient skywatchers? Before we can answer
that question, we must be clear about how precession is viewed in the heavens and
how the Mesoamericans developed different precession-tracking methods.
As explained earlier, the ecliptic is the path followed by the sun, moon, and
planets. Viewed as an arch in the sky, it stretches, for observers in the Northern
Hemisphere, from the southeast to the southwest. The ecliptic circles the sky and
the twelve constellations that lie along its "road" are the well-known zodiacal con¬
stellations. The sun journeys around the ecliptic once every year, and four "solar
stations" lie along the ecliptic—the two solstices and the two equinoxes. These
solar stations are like the anchors or "pillars" of the year, the "corners" of the
cosmic house, and they are located in specific constellations. As precession causes
the equinoxes and solstices to shift, the position of these solar stations against
background constellations slowly moves. For example, currently, the solar station
of the March equinox sun is about to move backward from Pisces into Aquarius.
Therefore, we can distinguish foreground features of the sky, which move with
precession, from background features, which stay fixed. Foreground features in¬
clude, as mentioned, the four seasonal stations (the position of the sun on the equi¬
noxes and solstices). Background features include the stars, constellations, and, most
importantly, the Milky Way. Since precession causes the foreground features to
move in relation to the background features, the background features can be used
as "markers" to track precession. In Western astrology, constellations are used for
this purpose. However, the dividing point between constellations is very loose. We
understand that constellations are each 30° wide, but this is an ideal, average mea¬
sure. As observed in the sky, the sizes of individual zodiacal constellations vary
greatly, and thus they cannot be used to accurately demarcate precessional move¬
ment. The Milky Way, on the other hand, is a band in the sky, and is much less
ambiguous as a marker. The Maya used the Milky Way as their World Age marker.
They calculated precession based upon the observed movement of the December
solstice sun (a foreground feature) toward the Milky Way (a background feature).
One way to visualize this is to measure the distance of the Milky Way above the
dawning December solstice sun (see diagram 10).
As the ancient skywatchers observed, over many years, the solstice sun and
the Milky Way drawing closer together, they realized that a synchronization or
conjunction would happen during some future epoch. The calculation of when this



PRECESSION: THE MYSTERY OF THE ACES / 45
conjunction was to happen was encoded in
the Long Count calendar.
The astronomical synchronization I
just described involves one method used
by the ancient Mesoamerican skywatchers
to track precession. The other method can
be explained with the same "foreground
background" model, in the following way:
Besides the four seasonal quarters as fore¬
ground features, there are also the two dates
of the solar zenith passage. We can call these
the sun's "zenith stations." (As mentioned
earlier, the exact dates of the sun's zenith
passage depend upon the latitude of obser¬
vation,- Appendix 3 contains detailed tables
for these latitude-dependent dates.) Like the
seasonal quarters, the sun's zenith stations
are foreground "anchors" against which precession can be tracked. The background
feature used in this method was a constellation, the Pleiades. The New Fire cer¬
emony of the Toltecs is a critical key to understanding how this tracking method
worked. In addition, the Pyramid of Kukulcan at Chichen Itza provides another
missing link. I will discuss this Zenith Cosmology in more detail in Part II. For
now, suffice it to say that as I reassembled the forgotten Zenith Cosmology, I real¬
ized that the Pyramid of Kukulcan is a precessional star-clock, and the synchroni¬
zation of the Pleiades with the zenith sun is the Zero Point of this alternate
precession-tracking method.

gence of the Milky Way and December sol¬
stice sun

It is quite apparent that precession, the slow shifting of the stellar frame of
time, was of great interest to Mesoamerican astronomers. Because modern astrono¬
mers recognize that precession is relatively hard to detect and measure, many Maya
scholars casually dismiss the idea that Mesoamerican stargazers knew anything at
all about it.5 And yet, the end-date alignment alone strongly suggests that they did.
My interpretation of the Long Count calendar, as a system that pinpointed an align



46/ MAYA CO SMOG E N E S I S 2012
ment in precession to occur some 2,100 years after its invention, may appear un¬
likely or fantastic. It may even be met with scoffing skepticism despite the simple
fact that the 13-baktun cycle end-date does, without any help from me, very accu¬
rately identify a glaringly obvious and compelling alignment in the cycle of preces¬
sion. Coincidence? This is what must be considered unlikely.
Since the Mesoamerican understanding of precession is a potentially contro¬
versial topic, I decided I had to carefully survey scholarly opinions about this. I
was delighted and surprised to find that the scholars most qualified to comment
on this question consider it quite likely that ancient Mesoamerican skywatchers
were aware of precession. For example, elder Maya scholar Gordon Brotherston,
author of numerous books and essays and professor of literature at the University
of Essex, wrote that "the great year of equinoctial precession emerges as a missing
link between the local and political chronology of our era and the vast evolution¬
ary philosophy of time so vividly testified to in the Popol Vuh."6 Here we find an
eminent Mesoamerican scholar saying, rather matter of factly, that the Popol Vuh
contains a "vast evolutionary philosophy" derived from the Mayas' understanding
of the nature of precession. And why shouldn't the ancient Maya have understood
precession? In terms of mathematics, astronomy, and calendries, the Maya are
recognized as the most advanced of all the New World cultures. Mayanists talk
routinely of the "year-drift formula," developed over 2,000 years ago, which en¬
abled ancient skywatchers to calculate the solar year to an accuracy of four deci¬
mal places. Future eclipse dates were calculated with great accuracy. Maya scholar
J. Eric S. Thompson noted that the Venus Calendar of the Classic-period Maya
used a correction mechanism that lost only .08 days in 468 years! Overall, Bro
therston's assessment is fair and accurate: "From a practical point of view, a cul¬
ture as ancient, numerate, and chronologically sophisticated as that of Mesoamerica
is more likely than not to have detected and then measured the phenomenon of
precession."7
On this question, I have collected a host of additional comments by scholars in
Appendix 2, "Mesoamerican Precessional Knowledge: In the Literature." The point
of this brief overview is simple: The ancient Mesoamerican skywatchers indepen¬
dently discovered and calculated precession. But let me conclude with one final
statement on whether or not the ancient skywatchers knew about precession. It is
by archaeoastronomer and Maya scholar Anthony Aveni, probably the Mayanist
most qualified to comment on this point. In his definitive book Skywatchers of



PRECESSION: THE MYSTERY OF THE ACES / 47
Ancient Mexico, Aveni writes that ''Ancient astronomers easily could detect the
long-term precessional motion by witnessing changes in the time of year at which
the bright stars underwent heliacal rising.... Through myth and legend the earliest
skywatchers transmitted their consciousness of the passage of the vernal equinox
along the zodiac from constellation to constellation."8

CHAPTER 5
MYTHOLOGY AND ASTRONOMY
M
aya Creation mythology is rooted in celestial events involving stars, the
Milky Way, and certain constellations. Mythological stories, especially those
that involve cosmogenesis—the origin of the world—are derived from observa¬
tions of celestial movements. This is not strictly a Maya phenomenon, for many
ancient cultures naturally followed similar developmental pathways. For example,
Roman gods such as Jupiter and Saturn refer to planets. As mentioned in the last
chapter, Mithraism was a mystery cult that had precession as its highest mytho
astronomical revelation. In this chapter I will sketch, with examples, how many
ancient cultures wove their mythologies with the information gathered by observ¬
ing the sky.
For most of the twentieth century it has been somewhat unfashionable in schol¬
arly circles to see astronomy in ancient myth. Events around the turn of the cen¬
tury reveal a source of bias. The Panbabylonians were a group of German scholars
who believed that all myth descended from the astronomical discoveries of the
Babylonians. They proposed, along with politically incorrect metaphysical doctrines,
that the ancient Babylonians had discovered the precession of the equinoxes and
that this knowledge gave rise to Creation myths and a doctrine of World Ages that
spread to other cultures, including the Egyptians and the Greeks. On the eve of
World War I, however, the Panbabylonians were discredited and disbanded. As many
scholars had shown interest in this group, it was a somewhat embarrassing debacle.
The effect of this episode on academia was that it became taboo to see astronomy
in ancient myth. And there the situation rested for several decades.
In the 1940s and 1950s, the work of anthropologist Flertha von Dechend per¬
sistently fought this bias. FFer research led to the writing and publication, in 1969,
49



50/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
of Hamlet’s Mill, coauthored with Giorgio de Santillana. In the 1960s and 1970s,
the new field of archaeoastronomy dealt seriously with the relationships between
astronomy, architectural orientation, mythology, and culture. Gerald Hawkins' book
Stonehenge Decoded, published in 1970, contributed to the revival of recognizing
mythic astronomy in the artifacts of ancient cultures. In the 1980s and early 1990s,
a revolution in understanding Maya cosmology took place when scholars explored,
once again, the likely relationship between ancient astronomy and ancient myth.
Maya epigrapher and art historian Linda Scheie contributed a great deal to this
revolution, and her work was published in 1993 in Maya Cosmos.
Still, Hamlet’s Mill was the single most important book to pioneer an accurate
reappraisal of how cosmologically advanced our ancient ancestors truly were. The
recurring leitmotif in Hamlet’s Mill is that astronomy and mythology were closely
related in the thinking of many ancient cultures. By unraveling the threads of how
myth and astronomy were woven together by ancient skywatchers, Santillana and
von Dechend exposed precession as a central consideration. With exhaustive docu¬
mentation and erudition, the authors of Hamlet’s Mill provided comparative analy¬
ses of astronomical features involved in the precession question. They endeavored
to decode the mythic language of astronomy and proposed several core principles or
rules.
• Animals, gods, and goddesses frequently represent planets, stars, or other
astronomical features.
• Adventures ostensibly taking place on the surface of the Earth are meta¬
phors for events actually taking place in the sky, revealing a belief in
parallel, or synchronized, action between heaven and Earth.
In my own research I have confirmed von Dechend and Santillana's work and
I realized the importance of another core principle: One astronomical feature may
be mythologized in several different ways. For example, the Aztec deity Quetzal
coatl refers to Venus as morning star whereas his dark twin, Tezcatlipoca, refers to
Venus as evening star. Here we are reminded that Mesoamerican deities typically
rule sectors of time rather than objects. For example, though the sun appears every
day, the December solstice Sun Lord appears only on the December solstice. The
March equinox Sun Lord is a completely different deity. In this way, we see how
different deities manifest through the same physical object.



MYTHOLOGY AND ASTRONOMY / 51
In Maya thought, gods represent intangible forces or principles that can mani¬
fest in many different events at different times. The Lightning God is present dur¬
ing thunderstorms, but is also present when a human being has an orgasm. The Fire
God is present during violent volcanic eruptions, but also during a calm, cozy evening
around the family hearth. Predictably, this cornucopia of deities engendered confu¬
sion among early ethnographers, to the point that some considered Maya mythol¬
ogy itself to be hopelessly degenerate and fragmented. However, the confusion was
based on the Western assumption that a planet, being an "object/' must be ruled by
one deity.
These cosmo-conceptions, many of which seem unorthodox to our own as¬
sumptions, reveal a progressive worldview that recognizes the underlying spiritual
realm as primary to the realm of physical, material manifestation. Like the Hopi,
whose kachina spirit controls the manifestation of rain, the Maya believed that
spiritual forces and their ruling deities underlie and control material manifesta¬
tion. Therefore, in our exploration of Maya cosmogenesis, we must recognize and
decipher the different representations of the same astronomical events in Maya
mythology, rather than erroneously attempt to identify the "real" one.
In the following illustrations, I have chosen to focus on the astronomical fea¬
tures that are relevant to the end-date astronomy, which include the Milky Way
and dark-rift. The Mesoamericans mythologized the Milky Way as a cosmic tree, a
cosmic mountain or volcano, a cosmic ballcourt, a Great Mother, a snake or croco¬
dile monster, a white road, and a river. The mythic identities of the dark-rift can be
paired with these mythic identities of the Milky Way in the following way:
MILKY WAY DARK-RIFT
Cosmic Tree
Cosmic Mountain
Cosmic Volcano
Ballcourt
Great Mother
Snake / Monster
White Road

Birth Canal

Black Road

These identifications often cross over in the symbol system of Mesoamerican



52 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
art. For example, the glyph for a ballcourt
resembles, in its basic structural arrange¬
ment, the image of the Solar Lord emerg¬
ing from the cleft head of a
"cosmic monster."
The cosmic monster
also is referred to as the
Cauac (Kah-wok) monster,
a deity with a huge gaping
mouth that alternately de

glyph and Cauac mon¬
ster
vours and births deities and worlds. In the dia¬
gram above, the Cauac monster has
a stepped forehead, a symbol that, in other contexts,
represents the steps of the ballcourt. The cosmic mon¬
ster also is visualized as a snake with a large mouth
out of which deities and ancestors emerge. According
to scholars, this sky-snake is Mixcoatl, the Milky
Way.1
If we can take this symbology a step further, the
mouth of this Milky Way snake is probably the dark-rift. And the solar warrior that
emerges from the mouth represents the sun. So, in this simple image, the astro¬
nomical event of the sun within the dark-rift in the Milky Way is portrayed.
For now, the cross-comparative chart given above is intended to introduce
some unusual aspects of Mesoamerican cosmo-conception and illustrate how as¬
tronomical features, especially those associated with the end-date alignment, were
mythologized in a rich variety of mutually supporting ways. There is additional
evidence that the dark-rift was mythologized as the mouth of the Milky Way
sky-snake, which I will address in the next section.
Diagram 12. Mixcoatl, the Milky
Way
NEW WORLD MYTHIC ASTRONOMY
Scholars in many fields of study identify the astronomical features involved in
the end-date alignment as being significant in Mesoamerican thought. A cosmo¬
logical model proposed by Maya scholar David Kelley targets the dark-rift in the
Milky Way as a place where time cycles begin and end.2 Most significantly, his



MYTHOLOGY AND ASTRONOMY / 53
model highlights the dark-rift as a Creation Place, which it certainly is if we accept
the cosmology defined by the end-date alignment. His work also shows that the
Mesoamericans used the Milky Way as a calendric division line—a cosmic axis.3
Kelley wanted to locate the celestial placement of specific deities, the key deity
being Xiuhtecuhtli, Lord of the Year and Lord of Fire, because that god's calendric
associations are well-known. The three basic time-cycles in the Mesoamerican cal¬
endar are:
• The nine Lords of the Night cycle
• The thirteen day-number cycle
• The twenty day-sign cycle
The Lord of Fire, Xiuhtecuhtli, like all Mesoamerican deities, has a host of
attributes including color, number, and direction. Significantly, he is the first of the
thirteen day-numbers, first of the nine Lords of the
Night, and ninth of the twenty sacred day-signs. Kelley
argues that Xiuhtecuhtli's astronomical location is the
belt stars of Orion, which, in Aztec myth, are associ¬
ated with the fire sticks and the primal fire. This con¬
stellation is located close to where the Milky Way
crosses the ecliptic in Gemini. Given the connections
between astronomy, number, and deity, the basic
cycles of the Mesoamerican calendar can be placed in
the sky as shown in diagram 13.
The Milky Way with its dark-rift clearly resembles
a snake monster with gaping maw. Notice how the
dark-rift serves as an end-place for the thirteen-day
cycle as well as for the nine-day cycle. It also serves as
the beginning and end of the twenty-day cycle. Kelley calls the split in the Milky
Way defined by the dark-rift as the upper and lower jaws of the Cauac monster—the
cosmic monster that is the Milky Way. He also calls the Milky Way the Tamoanchan
Tree, which is the Creation Place of Central Mexican mythology. This cosmic
monster's head and mouth form the base of the Tamoanchan Tree. Significantly,
many trees at Izapa, the city where the Galactic Cosmology was formulated, were
marked with a monster mask at their base.

Since astronomically the base of the tree is the dark-rift
near Sagittarius, then conversely, the top of the tree would be
located in Gemini. Overall, Kelley's model tells us that the
Milky Way serves as an end-beginning divider in Mesoamerican
cosmology and calendrics. Specifically, the part of the Milky
Way where the dark-rift is located is seen to be the mouth of
the Milky Way monster, a Creation Place where time ends and
begins anew.4
Additional examples add to the Milky Way's many roles.
In the 1970s, ethnographer Gary Urton studied the cosmology
of the Quechua Indians from the Peruvian village of Misminay,
a short distance from Cuzco. In his book At the Crossroads of
Earth and Sky, he reports his discovery of an amazingly com¬
plex geo-cosmic mapping system based upon sky lore. These
ideas found among the Quechua of Misminay are probably late
survivals of ancient Inca cosmology. The ancient people of Peru were very inter¬
ested in the Milky Way, in its different widths and varying brightness as well as in
its dark spaces. The Quechua recognized several distinct "dark-cloud" constella¬
tions within the Milky Way.5 These constellations are different from the "connect
the dot" asterisms of Western astronomy. The Quechua dark-cloud constellations
consist of the dark ridges and spaces within the Milky Way, similar to the dark-rift
in the Milky Way recognized in the mythology of the Maya.
For the Quechua, the dates when the sun conjuncted the Milky Way were of
great interest, for then the sun would pass into the road of souls. In Gary Urton's
diagrams we see a hint of the fact that the December solstice sun is currently close
to conjuncting the Milky Way.
During the time of conjunction, the Que¬
chua believe, as do the Maya, that the sun en¬
ters the road that leads to the land of the dead.
On the other hand, the Quechua also recognize
that the terrestrial counterpart to the Milky Way
is the sacred Vilcanota River, which runs through
Misminay village. Rather than contradicting the
Milky Way's identity as a celestial road, this new
Diagram 15. Solstice and Milky Way identity as a river enriches the Milky Way's

MYTHOLOGY AND ASTRONOMY / 55
power. Also, it reveals how the Quechua mapped the sky onto significant local
geographical features.
In South America, the relationship between myth and astronomy is deep and
profound. William Sullivan's recent book, The Secret of the Incas, decodes preces
sional myths among the Inca, in which a dark-cloud constellation called Atoq' (Fox),
located close to the Maya dark-rift, was used as a marker to track precession. Ac¬
cording to Sullivan, a precessional alignment event occurred around a.d. 650 that
was incorporated into an Inca myth called "Why Fox's Tail is Black." See Appendix
6 for a closer look at Sullivan's contribution to elucidating precessional mythlore
in the New World.
Moving north from Peru to Honduras, we find the Chorti Maya, who still live
near the ancient Maya site of Copan. They perform a ritual to reenact the creation
of the world, called "raising the sky," which tracks the yearly movements of the
Milky Way. They named the Milky Way the "Camino de Santiago" (The Road of St.
James), after the patron saint Santiago, who controls thunder, rain, and the rain¬
bow. On the Chorti saint day of Santiago, July 25, the intersection of the Milky
Way and the ecliptic (the one near Gemini) passes straight overhead through the
zenith, forming a cross in the sky that is recognized as the Wakah-Chan, the Sacred
Tree of the Maya. This event defines the quadrated division of the cosmos, a model
employed by most Mesoamerican cultures.
Ethnographer Charles Wisdom explained that the Chorti see the Milky Way as
a wheel.6 This sounds strange, but when we understand how the Milky Way moves
through the sky in a single night, we can appreciate the Chorti image: the sky and
the Milky Way appear as a fish-eye lens spinning upon some invisible axis. In gen¬
eral, the Chorti are very interested in the changing movements of the Milky Way
throughout the night and the year. They are no doubt aware of its brightest and
widest area near Sagittarius and its dimmer, more diffuse area near Orion. In addi¬
tion, if they are aware of the Sacred Tree cross in Gemini, they most certainly are
aware of the other cross in Sagittarius.
In these examples we find that the Milky Way was mythologized as a road,
a tree, a river, a cosmic monster, even a wheel. Let's narrow down our focus now
and look at the Popol Vuh for more examples of the Milky Way's mythic identi¬
ties, and let's also try to determine the astronomical identities of other Popol Vuh
characters.



56 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
ASTRONOMY IN THE POPOL VUH MYTH
The Quiche Maya book called the Popol Vuh is a Creation epic with a long
history. It recounts the adventures of the Hero Twins, among other deities, and
although it was recorded by the Quiche in the 1550s, some of its primary episodes
appear on Classic-period ceramics as well as on monuments at Izapa, which are
dated to about 100 b.c. No doubt, during its long history the Popol Vuh and the
astronomical identities ascribed to its characters have undergone changes. How¬
ever, by comparing the monuments of Izapa with Classic-period ceramics and the
Quiche Popol Vuh, we find that the astronomical meaning of several key episodes
in the Hero Twin myth, notably the demise of Seven Macaw, was preserved through¬
out its history.
The Popol Vuh refers to the dark-rift in several different mythological con¬
texts. The black cleft (or dark-rift) in the Milky Way and the crossing point of the
Milky Way and the ecliptic in Sagittarius are extremely important celestial fea¬
tures because of their involvement with the astronomical alignment that occurs on
the 13-baktun cycle end-date. Maya scholar Dennis Tedlock notes the identity of
the dark-rift and many other astronomical and calendric references in the Popol
Vuh, and has compared them to information in the Maya Dresden Codex. In his
1985 translation of the Popol Vuh, we find that ri be xibalba ("the road Xibalba")
also is known as "the Black Road." This is the road that beckoned One Hunahpu
and Seven Hunahpu (the Hero Twins' father and uncle) when they were on their
way to Xibalba, and it led to their deaths. Today, xibalba be ("the road to Xibalba")
is the Quiche term for the dark-rift in the Milky Way.7 Barbara Tedlock reports
these same identifications for the dark-rift in her ethnographic work among the
Quiche Maya.8
In one Popol Vuh episode, the Black Road speaks to the Hero Twins, suggesting
that the Black Road (the dark-rift) either has or is a mouth. This makes sense when
we remember that the dark-rift is the Road to the Underworld, and the mouths of
jaguars and snakes were also recognized as Underworld portals. As a result, when
we look at Maya carvings and see Maya lords being birthed from the mouths of
snakes, toads, or jaguar deities, we should suspect that they are being born from the
dark-rift—appropriately enough, since the Milky Way is the Great Mother and the
dark-rift is her birth canal.
A phrase in the Popol Vuh—cahib xalcat be—means "four junction roads" or



MYTHOLOGY AND ASTRONOMY / 57
simply "crossroads/1' These four roads emanate from the Milky Way/ecliptic cross¬
ing point, the cosmic navel, which is the place where the "fourfold siding, the
stretching of the cord" occurs, explained as the very first Creation event in the
Popol Vuh. According to Dennis Tedlock, Maya Creation "took place at a celestial
crossroads," and it is clear that he is referring to this information.9
Each of the four cosmic roads is associated with a color. The Black Road is, as
has been shown, the northward pointing part of the Milky Way containing the
dark-rift. The White Road is the white, star-rich part of the Milky Way that extends
south from the ecliptic. The Green and Red roads refer to the arms of the ecliptic
extending east and west from the Milky Way. The Maya intentionally mapped the
four cosmic roads onto the local environment. Typically, a village would have four
roads departing from its center, which served to divide the surrounding fields into
ritual and agricultural districts. Further afield, shrines in the distant mountains
were visited on specific days in the tzollcin calendar, and four sacred mountains
were each associated with a direction and a year-bearer. The organizational nucleus
for Maya culture was the central axis extending down to the city center from the
Heart of Sky—the center of the cosmic crossroads. As the title of Gary Urton's
book At the Crossroads of Earth and Sky suggests, indigenous New World cultures
mapped and organized their societies according to a celestial blueprint.
In another episode from the Popol Vuh, after One Hunahpu was killed, his head
was placed in the crook of a calabash tree which "stands by the road." Dennis Tedlock
writes that the calabash tree symbolizes the Milky Way, and the road near the tree is
the ecliptic.10 The crook or cleft in the tree near the ecliptic is thus the dark-rift.
Hanging in this spot, One Hunahpu's skull impregnates Blood Moon with the Hero
Twins. Later, the Hero Twins facilitate the resurrection of their father in the Under¬
world ballcourt, which is another metaphor for the dark-rift. In this important and
defining context, the dark-rift is a place of conception and, ultimately, rebirth.
But who is this One Hunahpu? What is his astronomical identity? In recon¬
structing the astronomical identity of One Hunahpu, I had to look at the era in
which he emerged into Maya consciousness. Since he is a central deity in the Hero
Twin myth, and episodes from this myth first appear on the monuments of Izapa, I
placed his origin at roughly 300 b.c. to 100 b.c. Earlier, David Kelley decoded the
astronomical identity of Xiuhtecuhtli, the Aztec Fire God, based upon calendric
and directional attributes. We can do the same for One Hunahpu.
The calendric day that represents One Hunahpu is One Ahau. The linguistic



58 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
transformations of One Hunahpu suggest his relationship with other Mesoamerican
deities over a 2,200-year history:
Hun-rakan
Hu-rakan (Hurricane)
Hun Hunahpu (One Hunahpu)
One Ahau
Hun-Ahpu
Hun abku
Hunab Ku11
During the Classic period of the Maya, One Ahau was the Sacred Day of Ve¬
nus, the tzolkin day that marked the beginning of a Venus Round period of 104
haab. In the dim mists of the Mesoamerican past, however, before the Venus Calen¬
dar came along, One Ahau had another very important meaning. Ahau was one of
the year-bearers in the earliest year-bearer system, the one probably used at Izapa.
The year-bearers in this system (known as the Type V system) are Ahau (Solar Lord),
Chicchan (Serpent), Oc (Dog) and Men (Eagle). As we saw earlier, year-bearers are
associated with the four geographical directions and also with the four seasonal
quarters (the two equinoxes and two solstices). One of the year-bearers is always
considered to be the senior year-bearer, and, of the Type V year-bearers listed, Ahau
was without doubt the most revered. Every fifty-two years the coefficient 1 comes
around to combine with the senior year-bearer on New Year's Day, thus initiating a
new Calendar Round cycle. Clearly, One Ahau/One Hunahpu would have been the
senior year-bearer and Calendar Round initiator.
The next question is "which seasonal quarter is senior?" Although some may
argue for the March equinox, my research reveals that the December solstice fills
this position because it begins the return of the sun, the resurrection of the Ahau
Sun-Lord. We also may recall that the Long Count end-date is the big 4 Ahau day,
and its creators knew it corresponds to a December solstice. The rebirth of the sun
on the December solstice is a widespread Maya belief.12 That the Maya believed
the winter solstice to be New Year's Day is suggested by the fact that it is still the
focus of a midnight ceremony among the Chamula Maya.13 Moreover, the Aztec
sun god Huitzilopochtli, in some contexts, appeared as the newborn sun on the
December solstice.14



MYTHOLOGY AND ASTRONOMY / 59
Therefore, it is highly likely that the December solstice was considered to be
the "senior" seasonal quarter, a miniature place of rebirth if you will, while Ahau
was clearly the senior day-sign. By linguistic, calendric, and astronomical evidence,
it is deeply probable that One Hunahpu symbolizes the December solstice sun. A
simpler form of this argument is as follows: As an "Ahau" or Lord, One Hunahpu is
a representative of the sun. As a First Father or "First Sun" deity, he represents the
first sun or "day" of the year, and therefore he symbolizes the December solstice
sun. Furthermore, in the Popol Vuh, One Hunahpu's resurrection signals the begin¬
ning of a new World Age. Since the December solstice sun is what gets reborn, we
are drawn to recognize the end-date alignment as what the Popol Vuh Creation
myth describes.
To illustrate the astronomical dimensions of another important episode in the
Popol Vuh, the conception of the Hero Twins, we must remember that deities, as
symbols of intangible forces, can manifest in different objects and events. The con¬
ception of the Hero Twins is the event that ultimately leads to One Hunahpu's
resurrection. Conception, birth, resurrection, and rebirth all partake of the same
principle that we may simply call "Creation," and One Hunahpu, as the primal
First Father progenitor, rules this Creation principle. In the episode of the Hero
Twins' conception, according to Dennis Tedlock, One Hunahpu's severed head sym¬
bolizes the conjunction of Jupiter and Venus.15 Jupiter and Venus become the source
of a creation, because the skull that represents them will impregnate Blood Moon
with the Hero Twins. When we remember that One Hunahpu's head is hung in the
dark-rift, we have an astronomical picture of the conception of the Hero Twins:
Jupiter and Venus conjunct in the dark-rift. Furthermore, Dennis Tedlock identi¬
fied Blood Moon as the waning moon in the east, adding another celestial body to
the conjunction.16 As a result, the Popol Vuh provides us with a temporal sky map
with which we can pinpoint when the Hero Twins, and their story, were created. In
other words, I realized that information in the Popol Vuh encodes the date of the
Hero Twin's conception. I consulted my astronomy software and, to my amaze¬
ment, found a December solstice date in the second century b.c. that beautifully
portrays the cosmic conception of the Hero Twins. I will explore these findings in
more detail in Part III.
Additional mythic players in the Popol Vuh beckon to be identified astronomi¬
cally. What of the 400 Boys? Or Seven Macaw? As we will see, these stars of Maya
mythology were associated with specific astronomical features, and their behavior,



60/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
although complex and varied, suggests they were involved in ancient descriptions
of precession.
In the Popol Vuh, the story of the death of the 400 Boys recalls Old World preces
sional imagery of a tent being pulled down. This image derives from the polar axis
being understood as the central pole of a cosmic tent. Zipacna, son of Seven Macaw,
finds the 400 Boys laboring to erect the central pole for their tent. He helps them by
digging a deep hole, and aborts their plan to kill him by hiding in a side tunnel he dug
to save himself. When they slam
the pole down into the hole, the
400 Boys congratulate them¬
selves by getting drunk, think¬
ing they have killed Zipacna.
However, Zipacna surprises
them by bringing the house tent
down on their heads. Here we
see the familiar theme of the
central axis being yanked out of
its fixture, an image of the shift
' According to Dennis Tedlock,
the murdered 400 Boys ascend into the sky and become the Pleiades.17
The father of Zipacna, Seven Macaw, was thought of as a vain and false ruler of
a previous World Age, the age of the wooden people.
The Hero Twins had to do away with him before they
could begin their work to resurrect and instate their fa¬
ther, One Hunahpu, as the true World Age ruler. A paint¬
ing on a Maya vase (above) illustrates one of the Hero
Twins shooting Seven Macaw out of his throne. Al¬
though this painting is from the Classic period, it con¬
tains the same information as this image from Izapa,
carved some six hundred years earlier (see diagram 17).
Both illustrations depict Seven Macaw about to fall
from his throne in the polar center, and both preserve
the same underlying astronomical meaning. Seven Ma¬
caw has been identified by ethnographers working among
the highland Maya as the Big Dipper, while his wife

ing Pole Star, which defines "the end of the world.



MYTHOLOGY AND ASTRONOMY / 61
Chimalmat is the Little Dipper.18 The latter constellation contains the Pole Star, and
both may be said to be regents of the polar zone.
In the Popol Vuh, Seven Macaw was a false god—a ruler of a previous World
Age—suggesting that the Pole Star is a "false" Heart of Heaven. His demise signi¬
fies the downfall of a previous worldview, that of the Olmec. If the polar region was
realized to be a "false" celestial center, a mistaken place of creation, in what way
does Seven Macaw fall away from his polar perch? We saw earlier how the Olmec of
La Venta determined, as a result of discovering precession, that the polar area was
not a valid cosmic center. In Part IV we will find out exactly how precession causes
Seven Macaw to fall from his polar perch.
THE UNDERWORLD ROAD TO BAKTUN 13
The Black Road, the crook in the calabash tree, the cosmic birthplace, the
crossroads, the jaguar's mouth, the Sacred Tree, xibalba be—all of these
mytho-astronomical concepts point to the same location: the dark-rift in the Milky
Way. In its deepest meanings, the dark-rift is a place of connection between life and
death, the Earth and the Underworld—a place where Creation occurs. It is the por¬
tal to the Otherworld and a birth-death nexus. The dark-rift is a central player in
the Maya myth of cosmogenesis, as well as in the precession-caused astronomical
alignment that culminates in a.d. 2012.
The rich astronomical information provided by the Quiche Popol Vuh allows
us to expand how we understand the dark-rift's meanings. In general, it can be seen
as a black spot at the top of the sky—a dark "hole" near the cosmic crossroads
formed by the Milky Way and ecliptic. The cosmic center associated with this area
of the sky is, as was sketched earlier, the Galactic Center. We also saw earlier how
the Mesoamerican astronomers recognized two other cosmic centers, one in the
zenith and one in the North Celestial Pole. Let's return to the Chorti and Yucatec
material and see how the concept of the hole in the sky also applied to the zenith.
The modern Chorti, as well as the modern Yucatec Maya, erect a ceremonial
house in which four poles are lashed together at the top. An offering plate is hung
from the centerpoint, which is thought of as a hole in the sky, a sacred doorway at
the center of the sacred crossroads. The Yucatec Mayas' term for this centerpoint is
u hoi Glorya, translated as the Glory Hole.19
Located at the top of the sky in the center of the cosmic crossroads, the Glory



62/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
Diagram 18. Ceremonial house with top
knot “hole” as an image of the cosmic cen¬
ter as a hole in the sky
Hole is a sacred conduit between Earth and the inner planes of the sky. The Yucatec
ceremonialists explicitly associate it with the zenith, which makes sense when we
remember that the Zenith Cosmology flow¬
ered at Chichen Itza after the Toltecs arrived
in the Yucatan in the ninth century a.d. The
point is that the ritual structure of the Yuca¬
tec ceremonial house also could apply to the
Galactic Cosmology, in which the dark-rift
would be the Glory Hole and the four lashed
poles would represent the four roads formed
by the Milky Way/ecliptic cross. Given the
Chorti interest in this cosmic crossroads, the
Chorti ceremonial house may, in fact, be ori¬
ented to the Galactic Center rather than the zenith. Nevertheless, in both examples,
the celestial dome of the night sky is envisioned as a house.
The Maya equate the four-cornered celestial dome with a house for other rea¬
sons. Houses "belong" to women. When a Maya woman marries and becomes a
mother, she "owns" the family house. Symbolically, she is the house. In fact, in the
Yucatec language and elsewhere, na means both house and mother. As a result, if
we expand these ideas to the level of the cosmos at large, the cosmos is a house, the
house is the mother; in other words, the cosmos is the Great Mother. The Milky
Way itself is the arched frame of the Cosmos-Mother, and her birth canal would
thus be the dark-rift—the "hole" at the deepest center of the night sky—that is, the
Underworld.
The same symbolic association is found among the Tzutujil Maya people of
Guatemala. They use sweat baths for practical health reasons as well as for ceremo¬
nial rebirthing. When they emerge from the door of the sweat house after a purify¬
ing cleanse, they believe they are reborn from the Great Mother. Their word for the
sweat house door is the same as their word for the cervix.20
These examples demonstrate that, in Mesoamerican cosmo-conception, an
entire complex of mythological meanings is associated with the dark-rift and the
Milky Way/ecliptic crossroads. The central meaning, however, can be distilled by
cross-comparing all of the metaphors. The dark-rift and the cosmic center clearly
have to do with birth and rebirth, the portal to another world, and World Age Cre¬
ation. The four-cornered house symbolizes the celestial dome centered upon the



is, MYTHOLOGY AND ASTRONOMY / 63
central hole of Creation and, depending on your cosmological training, this could
refer to either the zenith or the dark-rift. Most importantly, it is clear that the
dark-rift in the Milky Way was mythologized as the birth canal of the Great Mother.
It is the Underworld Black Road to baktun 13.
OF FIRE DRILLS AND POLE STARS
The authors of Hamlet’s Mill briefly discuss Mesoamerican symbology as it
relates to precession. Unfortunately, the Mesoamerican interpretations are some¬
what vague, understandable given the state of Maya studies when the authors were
writing in the late 1960s. However, they do mention the Aztec Fire Drill ceremony
and the Aztec god Tezcatlipoca. The fire drill symbolizes the cosmic axis, and
Tezcatlipoca, the one-foot deity, spins upon the Pole Star. Clearly, in this Aztec
cosmology, the cosmic axis of the fire drill shaft was fixed to the Pole Star.
The Maya counterpart to Tezcatlipoca is Hunrakan (or Hurakan), the twisted
“one-leg" god of the Quiche and other Maya groups. He is famous in the Popol Vuh
for bringing down destruction on a previous age, the age of the wooden people. He
wipes the slate clean by sending a universal flood down to Earth. Interestingly, the
English word hurricane is derived from Hurakan. The fact that Hunrakan is thought
of as being “caught in a whirlwind"—that is, spinning around—and literally means
"one-leg," associates him with the polar axis. This association is not limited to
Mesoamerica, and its universality attests to its validity. For example, Prince Dhruvi
in India was the World Age ruler who stood on one foot, and symbolized the North
Celestial Pole.21
The fire drill is the primeval machine. It spins and generates friction, fire, heat,
and preserves life. Furthermore, it may wear out and is subject to failure, which
brings about the end of a World Age. Robert Carlsen and Martin Prechtel, who lived
with the Maya for many years, illuminate the symbology of the fire drill in their
article "Weaving and Cosmos amongst the Tzutujil Maya of Guatemala." Among
the Tzutujil Maya, neighbors to the Quiche, the fire drill was operated with a bow
by pulling a cord wrapped around the shaft back and forth. The base of the shaft
went into a notch, and the back-and-forth process resembled both sex and weaving.
The base is female and the shaft is male, and the top of the shaft was hooked on the
celestial navel, the location of a high celestial deity.
Large fire drills needed two operators, one on each side, and many Meso



Diagram 19. Fire Drill gods
from the Dresden Codex
american images are based upon a structural arrange¬
ment I call the fire drill symbol.
Notice here that the drill shaft, symbol of the
World Axis, is flanked by two operators, who serve as
caretakers of time. Early Long Count monuments are
similarly structured, with
two attendants flan king a ver¬
tical glyph column containing
the Long Count date (see examples in Part IV).
The fire-drill symbol is ancient and global. In Hindu
cosmology, the image of the churning Milky Ocean (the
Milky Way as the generator of all manifestation) is struc¬
turally identical to the fire-drill symbol. The fire-drill sym¬
bol is also found in Egyptian symbolism, in which, again,
the cosmic axis of time is operated, like a fire drill, by at¬
tendants on the right and the left.
The polar axis, extending down from the North Ce¬
lestial Pole to the Earth, manifests in easily recognized
mythic symbols. It usually takes the form of a World Tree,
a cosmic fire drill, or a spinning "one leg" god. For many
cultures in the Far North the Pole Star that secures the
cosmic axis is called the "Nail of the North." In Finnish mythology, the celestial
axis centered upon the Pole Star is symbolized by the
Sampo, a magic spinning mill with a "many ciphered
cover" that represents the twinkling stars of the night
sky. Significantly, in Runo 42 of the Finnish Kalevala,
the Sampo is stolen, that is, removed from its former
place of residence. As argued in Hamlet’s Mill, this story
probably represents a knowledge of the shifting frame
of time, an awareness of precession among the ancient
Finns. Likewise, in the Egyptian and Hindu images, the
same knowledge is implicit, because the common ele¬
ment of the myths surrounding the fire drill symbol is
that the shaft eventually wears out its "hinge" and the
spinning skies go out of kilter.

The fire drill found in Mesoamerican art and sym¬
bolism is especially common at Izapa. Izapan Stela 2 clearly
depicts the fire-drill symbology and also illustrates an event
in the Hero Twin story—the demise of Seven Macaw.
This stela shows the Hero Twins Hunahpu and
Xbalanque, as the World Axis attendants, facilitating the
demise of Seven Macaw. As mentioned earlier, Seven
Macaw was a polar deity, confirming that this Izapan fire
drill image does, like the other examples given above, sym¬
bolize the polar axis and the North Celestial Pole.
The comparison here of Izapan, Maya, Aztec, Finn¬
ish, Egyptian, and Indian symbology suggests a univer¬
sally shared concept: the maintenance of time and the
continuation of the cycles of heaven facilitated by two
important twin beings, the fire-drill gods. Encoded in these
images is an underlying knowledge that the fire drill and its ruling deity periodi¬
cally must be replaced, that precession will cause the polar axis to point to different
Pole Stars over long periods. For example, we mentioned that Tezcatlipoca was the
one-legged polar deity for the Aztecs. In fact, there are four Tezcatlipocas, and scholar
Eva Hunt has argued that these four Tezcatlipocas represented four different eras of
precession during which the North Celestial Pole pointed to four different Pole
Stars over a very large period of time.22
As can be seen from all of the examples in this chapter, mythology and as¬
tronomy were intimately related in the beliefs of many ancient cultures around the
globe. In Mesomerican cosmology, the polar center was an important focus and
represents an older worldview, one that was superseded by new astronomical dis¬
coveries. Mesoamerican skywatchers were working with three cosmic centers, the
polar, the zenith, and the Galactic, and in Part IV we will return to the meaning of
the polar god Seven Macaw and understand how his 'Tall" symbolizes precessional
movement. But as we have already seen, over 2,400 years ago the zenith and the
Milky Way's great bulge (the Galactic Center) became especially interesting to
Mesoamerican skywatchers, more so than the old polar cosmology. Therefore, it is
time that we focus on the Galactic Center and the zenith center, and explore how
the cosmologies surrounding these two cosmic centers were developed in separate
regions and were eventually unified at Chichen Itza.

THE PYRAMID OF KUKULCAN:
A COSMIC MYTH IN STONE
M
esoamerican cosmologists hailed different alignments in the precessional
cycle as rare eras of change and accelerated evolution on Earth, or World
Age shifts. In my work with the ancient cosmologies of Mesoamerica, I identified
two different alignments in precession that were being tracked by the ancient
skywatchers. The Toltecs preferred an alignment centering on the zenith, whereas
the Maya claimed the one oriented toward the Galaxy. Each culture explained the
astronomical alignment with a myth: The Toltecs used the New Fire myth and its
attendant ceremony, and the Maya created the Hero Twin myth. As my search into
the mysteries of the ancient past deepened, I realized that these two World Age
traditions were in conflict. Although both are rooted in the precession of the equi¬
noxes, the Toltec and Maya timings of the future World Age shift were, in their
original formulation, not in agreement. Culturally and politically, this disagree¬
ment created a fundamental schism in the Mesoamerican psyche that lasted over
eight hundred years. The Toltec empire centering on Teotihuacan fell in the eighth
century a.d., around the same time the Maya empire to the east began experiencing
instability. However, as Mesoamerican civilization approached its apocalyptic melt¬
down in the eighth and ninth centuries, Chichen Itza emerged as the place where
the Toltec and the Maya World Age systems (the Zenith Cosmology and the Galac¬
tic Cosmology) were both preserved and, moreover, unified. The Maya-Toltec rec¬
onciliation is portrayed on murals at Chichen Itza in the union of two deity-rulers,

Captain Sun Disk and Captain Serpent.1 By the end of Part II, it will become clear
why these avatars, or cosmic representatives, symbolize the two World Age
cosmologies of the Maya and the Toltec cultures.
My research shows that the Toltec method of tracking precession involved the
New Fire ceremony and the movement of the sun and the Pleiades in relation to
the zenith. This method of sky charting was transplanted to Chichen Itza in the
Yucatan with Toltec migrations beginning in the eighth century a.d. The Pyramid
of Kukulcan at Chichen Itza was built in the early ninth century and encodes a
profound message derived from the Toltec precession-tracking system.
CHICHEN ITZA: SHADOW PLAY ON THE EQUINOX
Chichen Itza is the site of several phases of Maya culture, beginning over 2,000
years ago. The city was founded and originally inhabited by the Maya. However, in
the eighth century a.d., the great Toltec city of Teotihuacan in Central Mexico
collapsed, and many Toltecs migrated east to the Yucatan. This influx of foreigners
stimulated new growth at Chichen Itza, but at a cost. As recorded on fantastic
murals near Chichen Itza's famous ballcourt, the
Toltec invaders occupied the city and began to
implement their own skywatching agenda. A vig¬
orous blending of the Maya and Toltec cultures
ensued, resulting in the building of Chichen's
best known structures, including the Caracol
observatory, the Great Ballcourt, and the Pyra¬
mid of Kukulcan. The hybrid Toltec-Maya cul¬
ture, as portrayed in the art and architecture of
the Yucatan, is especially present at Chichen Itza.
As such, we can think of Chichen Itza as the
headquarters for the unique ninth-century
merger of the Maya and Toltec cultures.
Chichen Itza is probably the most visited and
best known site in the Yucatan. One can visit
the Great Ballcourt, the Pyramid of Kukulcan,
the Hall of Atlantean Columns, the Caracol ob¬
servatory, and the Sacred Well (the cenote). But

the city's biggest attraction is an amazing astronomical event that occurs every
spring equinox. On this day, March 21, thousands of visitors pack in around the
Pyramid of Kukulcan and prepare to watch the shadow-play caused by the after¬
noon sun. Around 4:00 p.m., the rays of the sun cast a shadow that looks like an
undulating snake onto the side of the north stairway. A serpent's head carved in
stone at the base of the stairway completes the picture of an upside-down serpent
a deity-serpent descending from the sky—that is quite common in Mesoamerican
art. One can imagine that the snake's tail, or rattle, points through the roof of the
little room on top of the pyramid. Visitors go away from this experience amazed at
the sophisticated and ingenious people who could build a mythological story into
their monumental architecture. It is the story of the return of the solar warmth and
life energy at the spring equinox, the annual renewal of the serpent-power in the
agricultural, religious, and political affairs of the city.
The head of the snake points to the nearby cenote,
and part of the mystery-play enacted by the ancient
Maya-Toltec priests every March equinox no doubt in¬
volved processions from the Pyramid of Kukulcan to the
Sacred Well, where ritual sacrifices took place. Stone carv¬
ings of inverted serpents are found throughout Chichen
Itza, often as roof supports or stylized doorjamb orna¬
ments.
The solar-snake of Yucatec Maya mythology is
Kukulcan, whose counter¬
part in Toltec mythology Diagram 24. Inverted Ser
is Quetzalcoatl, the Plumed Pent at Chichen itza
Serpent.
According to Mexican researcher Jose Diaz-Bolio,
the Yucatec rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus durissus)
was the focus of ancient Maya ceremonies and sym¬
bolized the sun.2 During Diaz-Bolio's intimate study
of these snakes he noticed that a little round design
resembling a "solar face" can be found near their rattle
(see diagram 26).
Diagram 25. Quetzalcoatl, from the Codex Telleriano- Remensis



72 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
Diaz-Bolio believes the Maya recognized these
natural designs as symbols of the sun deity, and the
nearby rattle represented the sun deity's crown. The
number of segments in a snake's rattle increases ev¬
ery year, and thus the rattle, for the ancient Maya,
was a perfect symbol of time. Maya kings were ava¬
tars of the sun and were especially revered if they ruled
for many years, or, metaphorically speaking, if their
"rattle-crowns got longer." In addition, snakes shed
their skins at the height of the hot season, which sym¬
bolizes the sun's annual rebirth. As such, for the an¬
cient Maya the snake was a compelling symbol of time and renewal, as well as of
rulership.
In his independently published book The Geometry of the Maya, Diaz-Bolio
provides further evidence that the ancient Maya recognized the little solar " Ahau"
faces on the serpent's tail and incorporated this symbol into their mythology. On a
decorative panel found near the Governor's Palace at Uxmal, Diaz-Bolio notes sev¬
eral tiny solar faces, each surrounded by a stylized rattle resembling a stepped pyra¬
mid. The equation between the segmented rattle and pyramid steps is significant,
given the fact that the shadow-serpent appears on the balustrade of the north stair¬
way of the Pyramid of Kukulcan. He found a similar motif on the Palace at Palenque,
in which he interprets the four stylized rattles around each solar face as symbols of
the four directions (and, I would add, the four year-bearers). More significantly still,
Diaz-Bolio's research led him to examine drawings of ancient carvings made during
an early expedition to Palenque, and he notes a tiny human face in the tail of a
serpent that is held by two priests. For Diaz-Bolio, the solar face in the serpent's tail
symbolizes the sun, time, the calendar, and renewal.
Given Diaz-Bolio's findings and a general understanding of Yucatec Maya reli¬
gion, it is not surprising that the Maya chose Crotalus durissus d., with its provoca¬
tive natural markings, to represent a major deity, Kukulcan-Quetzalcoatl. The equi¬
nox shadow-play event is an astronomical and architectural wonder that tells a
story about the annual reappearance of Kukulcan. And this event continues to as¬
tonish thousands of visitors every year, who come to witness the esoteric secrets of
Maya cosmology. However, the shadow-serpent has not revealed all of its secrets.
At least, not until now.

talus durissus d.



THE PYRAMID OF KUKULCAN: A COSMIC MYTH IN STONE / 73
My interest in the deeper cosmological meaning of the equinox shadow-play
event increased when I realized that the Yucatec Maya word for the Pleiades is
tzab, which also means "rattle."3 In other words, for the ancient Yucatec Maya, the
Pleiades were symbolized by the rattle of the rattlesnake, and the rattle's place
during the equinox event at Chichen Itza is at the very top, the apex, of the pyra¬
mid. I wondered if something else might be going on here, something a little more
obscure and much more profound. How are the Pleiades associated with the top of
the pyramid, and what might that have to do with the sun and snakes? And how
might Maya and Toltec cosmology fit into this scenario? I began to feel that the
deeper meaning of the mythic drama of Kukulcan's manifestation on the spring
equinox still needed to be decoded.
TROPICAL ASTRONOMY ANDTHE ZENITH CENTER
The answer to the enigma of Chichen Itza's lost cosmology, as symbolized by
the equinox shadow-serpent, requires that we understand the sun's movements
within the tropical latitudes. The entire region defining Mesoamerica is completely
within the Tropics, that is, within 23°26' of the equator. Much of what seems so
obscure in Mesoamerican astrology will become more clear if we learn to appreci¬
ate the unusual dynamics of tropical astronomy.
At the tropical latitudes, the sun's daily and annual motion is much different
than what we would observe from Seattle, London, or New York. The tropical zone
is delineated by the tropic of Cancer (running through northern Mexico) and the
tropic of Capricorn (running through Chile in South America).4 The U.S. and Europe
are at northern latitudes, and when we watch the sun move through the sky during
a single day, it traces an arc to the south of us. It rises in the southeast and sets in the
southwest. On the December solstice, the arc is very low in the sky. On the June
solstice, the arc is much higher and longer, accounting for the longest day of the
year. But still, at our northern latitude, the sun never passes through the center of
the sky; it always makes an arc to the south of the zenith. The sun can pass through
the zenith only within the Tropics, and the exact dates of the solar zenith passage
vary with latitude. At latitude 23°26'N (the tropic of Cancer), the sun passes right
through the zenith only on one day—the June solstice.5 At noon on this day, no
shadows are cast, and the Toltec and Maya astronomers considered these "no shadow"
days to be very sacred. As you move south from the tropic of Cancer, the dates of the



74/ MAYA COSMOGENE5I5 7012
solar zenith passage change, and there will be two days every year when the sun
moves through the zenith, one on its journey from winter solstice to summer sol¬
stice, and one on its return journey from summer solstice to winter solstice. At the
latitude of Chichen Itza (20°40'N), zenith passages of the sun occur on May 23 and
July 23. A little further south, at latitude 19°40'N, a solar zenith passage happens on
July 26, and this is why the Yucatec Maya celebrated July 26 as New Year's Day.6
The sixteenth-century Yucatec Maya chief Juan Pio Perez confirmed this when he
wrote "To this day the Indians call the year Jaab or Haab, and . . . they commenced
it on the 16th of July. It is worthy to notice that their progenitors ... sought to make
it begin from the precise day on which the Sun returns to the zenith... ."7 July 16 in
the older Julian calendar is equivalent to July 26 in our Gregorian calendar—the
traditional and authentic New Year's Day for the Yucatec Maya. The use of this date
as New Year's Day, although significant only for a specific latitude, provides clear
evidence that solar zenith passages were very important in Yucatec cosmology and
Diagram 27. The sun and the Pleiades conjuncting in the zenith over Chichen Itza on May 20, 2000.
All of the inner planets are nearby



THE PYRAMID OF KUKULCAN: A COSMIC MYTH IN STONE / 75
calendrics. The uniquely compelling attribute of this date is, of course, that the sun
is in the precise center of the sky, in the Heart of Heaven.
The other zenith-passage date at latitude 19°40'N is May 20, which is sixty
days after the March equinox. Significantly, zenith-passage dates do not change with
the precession of the equinoxes. At latitude 19°40'N the first zenith passage of the
sun has always taken place sixty days after the spring equinox. Notice that there is
a slight difference between this May 20 date and the date of the solar zenith passage
a little further to the north, at Chichen Itza. The difference amounts to three days;
however, in terms of observing "no shadows at high noon," one would not be able to
distinguish any difference between May 20 and May 23.8 The fact is that zenith
passage observations, given the "no shadow at high noon" criterion, allow for a
range of days. If you go to Chichen Itza on May 20, you will observe no shadows at
high noon. For a detailed look at the nature of zenith-passage observations, see Ap¬
pendix 3, "Space-Time Maps of the Sun and Pleiades in the Zenith."
I am emphasizing this point to associate the May 20 zenith passage of the sun
with the mythic cosmo-drama encoded into the pyramid at Chichen Itza. And here
is the key to understanding its deeper cosmological meaning: The importance of
May 20 lies in the fact that the sun
and the Pleiades are currently in Diagram 28. The Zenith Cosmology over Chichen Itza
conjunction on this day. Thus, on
May 20, both the sun and the Ple¬
iades, together, pass through the
zenith directly over the Pyramid of
Kukulcan.
This alignment is compelling
in terms of World Age concepts be¬
cause it changes with precession.
In other words, one hundred years
ago this alignment was not in ef¬
fect at the latitude of Chichen Itza;
only in our current era is it com¬
ing into resonance. But how does
this relate to the equinox shadow
play event? Remember, the snake's
rattle symbolizes the Pleiades and
tzab = "rattle" For the Yucatec Maya, the Pleiades was known as the rattle constellation
Kukulcan - Quetzalcoatl manifestation on March 21 (any era)—a cosmic reminder? __

76/ MAYA COSMOOENESI5 2017
the "solar face" design near the rattle symbolizes the sun. During the equinox mani¬
festation of Kukulcan, the sun-Pleiades tail of the serpent-shadow points into the
center of the sky, the zenith.
The cosmic myth at Chichen Itza, as encoded into the famous shadow-serpent
event, thus involves a previously unrecognized World Age context, in that the sym¬
bology of the serpent's tail points to a rare precessional alignment of the sun and
the Pleiades in the zenith.
MAYA PYRAMIDS: COSMOG RAMS IN STONE
A general facet of pyramid symbolism among the Maya is that they are cosmo
grams (symbols of the cosmos) in stone. The Pyramid of Kukulcan, when viewed
from above, represents the quadrated "completion" hieroglyph and symbolizes the
five cosmological directions—four at the corners and one in the center. The central
direction is the astronomical zenith.9
The apex of any Maya pyramid points to the zenith and might indicate certain
dates in the year on which astronomical events happen in the zenith, usually the
solar zenith passages. At Chichen Itza, the equinox appearance of the serpent-shadow
with the Pleiades tail indicates that the Pleiades are supposed to occupy the central
zenith direction of Kukulcan's pyramid. As we will see in Chapter 8, Classic-period
Maya rulers timed their accession ceremonies to coincide with astronomical events
happening in the zenith. Furthermore, these accession ceremonies took place on
the top of a pyramid, in the symbolic center of the
cosmos, the zenith center.
When the Pyramid of Kukulcan was built around
a.d. 830, it was designed to indicate a sun-Pleiades
alignment in the zenith. However, at the latitude of
Chichen Itza, this alignment does not begin until the
early twenty-first century a.d. The precession of the
equinoxes is responsible for bringing the sun and the
Pleiades together in the zenith, revealing that
Kukulcan's pyramid is a precessional clock with its
alarm set for the twenty-first century. Significantly,
the precessional alignment of the Zenith Cosmol¬
ogy is different than the one targeted by the Long
Diagram 29. Five directions:

THE PYRAMID OF KUKULCAN: A COSMIC MYTH IN STONE / 77
Count end-date in a.d. 2012. But how does this zenith alignment work? And how
was it tracked? As mentioned, zenith-passage dates vary depending on latitude,
and they do not change with precession. The sun has always passed through the
zenith over Chichen Itza on May 20.10 However, the date on which the sun and
the Pleiades conjunct does change with precession. Five hundred years ago, they
were conjunct on May 13. The conjunction of the sun and the Pleiades has begun
to occur on May 20 in our present era, which, significantly, corresponds to the
solar zenith-passage date at Chichen Itza. This convergence of separate phenom¬
ena is what makes the early twenty-first century a rare era of precessional align¬
ment for Chichen Itza.
What I call the Zenith Cosmology is a forgotten paradigm that could only be
reconstructed from looking carefully at Mesoamerican traditions, symbology, and
cosmological priorities. The best way to envision the converging phenomena of the
Zenith Cosmology is with the following diagram:
Year (a.d.) 1436 1508 1652 1724 1796 1940 2012 2084 2228
Date on 5.12 which the sun and Pleiades join in year shown
5.13 5.15 5.16 5.17 5.19 5.:10 5.21 5.23
At the latitude of Chichen Itza, the date of the solar zenith passage is May 20. Thus the sun-Pleiades join in the zenith on May 20.
Diagram 30. Alignment eras of the sun-Pleiades in the zenith
As will become clear, I believe that Kukulcan/Quetzalcoatl, the Plumed Ser¬
pent, was the symbol of the sun-Pleiades conjunction. Notice in the diagram that
for the latitude of Chichen Itza, the culmination of the Zenith Cosmology—that
is, when the sun and the Pleiades join in the zenith—is the twenty-first century
a.d. Thirteen hundred years ago the sun-Pleiades-zenith conjunction occurred on
May 1, which highlighted the latitude of Copan as the region blessed by the Plumed
Serpent. The nature of zenith phenomena is complicated. In general, the location
of the sun-Pleiades-zenith conjunction has moved from southerly latitudes (e.g.,
Copan) during the Maya Classic period northward to Chichen Itza, where it pres¬
ently occurs.



78 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2017
For Chichen Itza, the May 20 sun-Pleiades-zenith alignment speaks clearly to
the aspect of Maya cosmology having to do with World Age shiftings, great celestial
alignments, and vast epochs of time. The equinox shadow-play event thus seems to
be the annual reminder to look to the heavens, to remember the place from where
the Plumed Serpent springs, and to patiently await his return. The future return of
Quetzalcoatl, the Plumed Serpent, is one of the best-known Mexican myths. In the
popular literature, Quetzalcoatl has been variously identified as Saint Patrick, Jesus,
Hernan Cortes, or a space alien. But if we examine the early Toltec mythology, we
find that Quetzalcoatl was originally identified with the Pleiades.11 He also has
always had solar attributes, which does not create a conflict if we think of
Quetzalcoatl as that unique being who manifests when the sun and the Pleiades are
joined. Given that the deity Quetzalcoatl was first conceived at Teotihuacan, and
that city, as we saw previously, was oriented to an alignment with the Pleiades on
the May zenith-passage date, the return of Quetzalcoatl myth would seem to have
everything to do with a future era during which Quetzalcoatl (the sun and the Ple¬
iades united) takes his throne in the zenith center. In other words, the sun-Pleiades
deity (Quetzalcoatl) has been slowly marching toward the zenith center, moving
one degree closer every seventy-two years, to ultimately reclaim his ruling station
in the Heart of Heaven.
CHICHEN ITZA REVEALED
The sun-Pleiades-zenith alignment is currently within range at Chichen Itza.
However, we can't pin this alignment down to a specific year, because of the six-day
range for zenith-passage observations at the latitude of Chichen Itza. The
sun-Pleiades alignment over Chichen Itza begins around the year 2000, but con¬
tinues, for all observational purposes, for over two centuries. This entire period
may represent a period of renaissance for Maya culture in the Yucatan, during
which the ancient knowledge is reclaimed. Michael Coe, accomplished Maya
scholar, relates that the contemporary Yucatec Maya believe the world will end
"at the year 2000 plus a little."12 Although this may be a memory of the Long
Count end-date of a.d. 2012, we should not overlook the possibility that the
sun-Pleiades-zenith alignment over Chichen Itza (in the same era of the Long Count
end-date) may have been understood as separate confirmation of the older Long
Count end-date calculations.



THE PYRAMID OF KUKULCAN: A COSMIC MYTH IN STONE / 79
Here we begin to suspect something very interesting going on at Chichen Itza.
Is it a coincidence that the Zenith Cosmology just described points to the early
twenty-first century, as does the Long Count end-date, the Galactic Cosmology? As
revealed on the murals of Chichen Itza, a union of opposed political/cosmological
ideologies took place in the ninth century a.d.; we will examine this reconciliation
more closely in Chapter 12 in order to solve this enigma of conflicting World Age
cosmologies.
If we take the year a.d. 2012 as a good marker for the era in which the sun and
the Pleiades are conjunct on May 20, something doubly interesting is found. First,
on May 20 of a.d. 2012, there will be a solar eclipse that will sweep across central
and western North America. This means that the sun and the Pleiades will pass
through the zenith with the moon! Second, that date in the 260-day tzolkin calen¬
dar will be 10 Chicchan, and Chicchan means serpent. The Pyramid of Kukulcan
has nine levels and the top, central platform (the "zenith") is the tenth. Thus 10
Chicchan, May 20, 2012—the date of a solar eclipse—would be a most auspicious
day to consciously celebrate the ancient cosmic myth at Chichen Itza.
The pyramid at Chichen Itza is the site of an incredible mytho-cosmic story
set in stone. Until now, only part of this incredible story has been recognized. The
pyramid itself is a World Age calendar, pointing to a unique alignment in the Great
Cycle of precession. Many of us are familar with the shadow-play event that takes
place there on the spring equinox. In fact, it has become the annual pilgrimage site
of groups performing solar ceremonies and initiations. On the equinox day, Kukulcan
manifests and slithers down the stairs, tail up in the air, heading toward the cen
ote—and then is gone! My understanding of this event has expanded to incorporate
the fact that Kukulcan's rattle—the Pleiades—points to the zenith where the sun
and the Pleiades will be found sixty days later. But this conjunction only begins to
occur in our current era, extending through the next two centuries. The equinox
shadow, on the other hand, is not affected by precession and occurs in any era.
Thus, the serpent manifestation is, literally, the pointer to a zenith conjunction of
the sun and the Pleiades. The sun-Pleiades-zenith convocation, now beginning to
occur over Chichen Itza, may in fact herald the fabled "return of Quetzalcoatl."
If you go to Chichen Itza at high noon on May 20, know that the sun and the
Pleiades are up there, together, in the exact center of the sky. This may be the real
manifestation of Kukulcan signified by the equinox event. The citizens of
ninth-century Chichen Itza believed their city would be bathed by the light of the



80/ MAYA COSMOO E N E S I S 2012
great alignment sometime in the remote future. As such, the visible equinox mani¬
festation seems to be a perennial clue to help those who are alive during the Maya
end-times to get the message. The complete message. And the complete message
appears to be that when the sun and the Pleiades join forces in the Heart of Heaven,
Quetzalcoatl will return and a new era will dawn.13



CHAPTER 7
THE TRUE MEANING
OF THE NEW FIRE CEREMONY
T
he esoteric knowledge encoded into the Pyramid of Kukulcan came from Toltec
skywatchers originating from Teotihuacan in Central Mexico. But how did
these ancient skywatchers track the ever-changing dates of the sun-Pleiades con¬
junction? As competent astronomers and insightful cosmologists, they noticed that
the date of the sun-Pleiades conjunction was slowly moving toward the date of the
solar zenith passage. The nature of the convergence in some remote future epoch,
being a rare alignment in the Great Year of precession, most certainly would have
been considered justification for a World Age shift. But how did the early Teotihuacan
astronomer-priests pinpoint the exact day of the sun-Pleiades conjunction? After
all, the Pleiades are lost in the rays of the sun for more than four weeks, until they
rise heliacally in early June. The answer to our question comes from the most sig¬
nificant and best-known ritual event performed at Toltec Teotihuacan and Aztec
Tenochtitlan: the New Fire ceremony.
My reconstruction of the full meaning of the cosmic myth at Chichen Itza
identifies the relevance of the astronomy of the sun-Pleiades-zenith conjunction.
However, the tracking method used by Mesoamerican astronomers eluded me un¬
til I thought carefully about the nature of the New Fire observation of the Pleiades.
As a result, another unrecognized aspect of Mesoamerican cosmology came into
focus, and now adds to our understanding of ancient Mesoamerica's lost cos¬
mology.
81



82 / MAYA COSMOGENE5IS 2012
THE ZENITH COSMOLOGY TRACKING METHOD:
THE NEW FIRE CEREMONY
At the Central Mexican site of Teotihuacan, the New Fire ceremony was being
performed as early as the fourth century a.d.1 As mentioned earlier, when Teoti¬
huacan was built in the first century a.d., it was aligned with the Pleiades on the
May zenith-passage date. The Toltecs are called "the people of the Pleiades" be¬
cause this constellation played a major role in their ritual ceremonies and cosmo¬
logical doctrines. As archaeologists have shown, Toltec traditions from Teotihuacan
were brought to Chichen Itza in the ninth century a.d., and the New Fire ceremony
was being performed at Chichen Itza in late Classic times (a.d. 700- a.d. 900).2 In
the fourteenth century, the Aztecs of Central Mexico adopted the New Fire cer¬
emony, and it was still being practiced at the time of the Conquest. As documented
by Conquest-era commentator Bernardino Sahagun, the New Fire ceremony, also
known as "the Binding of the Years," involved the careful observation of the Pleia¬
des at the end of each fifty-two-year Calendar Round. Sahagun's indigenous infor¬
mants described for him the rites of the New Fire ceremony performed at Aztec
Tenochtitlan (Mexico City) in 1507: "These are representatives of the Pleiades which
mark the fifth cardinal point [the zenith]. At the beginning of a period of 52 years,
fire was newly kindled when the Pleiades were at the zenith at midnight. The flam¬
ing up of this fire was a sign to the anxious waiting multitude that the world was
not, as they had feared, to be swallowed up in darkness. . . ."3
Let us take a closer look at a typical New Fire ceremony as performed by the
Aztecs. During the time of the New Fire, when a Calendar Round was about to end,
the Aztec people ritually extinguished all fires, swept houses clean, and cast stat¬
ues and other relics into the water. The day before the beginning of the new Calen¬
dar Round era, a procession of Fire Priests and a captive warrior solemnly filed out
of Tenochtitlan toward the sacred Hill of the Star. Arriving at the Hill of the Star as
midnight approached, they watched the Pleiades nearing the zenith and prepared
their captive for sacrifice. In the city, the people climbed onto their roofs. Fear and
anticipation gripped every citizen, because if the Pleiades did not reach the center
of the sky at exactly midnight, they believed that "the world would end." When
midnight came and the Pleiades passed through the zenith, the warrior's heart was
sliced out. The Fire Priests immediately kindled a fire in the warrior's chest cavity
and anointed his still-beating heart in the sacred flames of the New Fire. The New



THE TRUE MEANING OF THE TOLTEC NEW FIRE CEREMONY / 83
Fire and the precious heart were simultaneously bathed in the light of the zenithal
Pleiades, and the continuation of time was assured. The highest offering on Earth
the human heart—was made at the correct astronomical moment. The god of the
zenith center was appeased, and the world would not be destroyed. The Aztec people
breathed a sigh of relief, because time would continue for at least another Calendar
Round. The New Fire was then used to rekindle all the main fires throughout the
city, and even those in distant towns of the Aztec empire.
This dramatic Mystery Play is thick with many levels of meaning. It involves
astronomy, human sacrifice, world renewal, and calendars. That human sacrifice is
involved in the ceremony has typically been what commentators have focused on,
but few scholars have looked closely at the astronomical dimensions of the New
Fire tradition.
One astronomical element in the New Fire ceremony, evident in Sahagun's
report given above, is critical to understanding what this tradition was really about:
The Aztec astronomer-priests observed the Pleiades pass through the zenith at
midnight. At Mesoamerican latitudes the Pleiades pass through the zenith quite
often. However, the Pleiades pass through the zenith at midnight on only one day,
currently in mid-November. I wondered what this may have signified to the an¬
cient Fire Priests, and why the precise midnight observation was so critical. Look¬
ing closely at the astronomy of the midnight zenith passage of the Pleiades, I real¬
ized that this event defines the day exactly six months later when the sun and
Pleiades are in conjunction! It thus appears likely that the New Fire ceremony was
used to identify the precise date of the sun-Pleiades conjunction, an event central
to the Zenith Cosmology I reconstructed at Chichen Itza. Calibrating the exact
date of the sun-Pleiades conjunction in May was a continual concern because that
date moves forward with precession. Thus, every 52 or 104 years, the day had to be
corrected. Clearly, the New Fire ceremony was really about the astronomical cali¬
bration of precession, despite its gory sideshow.
In 1507, the sun and the Pleiades were in conjunction on May 14, and the
Aztecs knew this because they observed, during the New Fire ceremony that took
place on November 14, the Pleiades pass through the zenith at midnight.4 But why
did they need to know the precise date of the sun-Pleiades conjunction? At the
latitude of Tenochtitlan, the first solar zenith passage occurs on May 18, four days
after the sun-Pleiades conjunction in 1507. Since precession moves the date of the
sun-Pleiades conjunction forward one day every seventy-two years, it would not



84/ MAYA COSMOG E N E S I S 2012
be for another three hundred or so years that the two dates aligned, and then the
sun and the Pleiades would occupy the zenith together. As we saw previously, the
May solar zenith-passage date was involved in the founding orientation of
Teotihuacan, the city that was hailed by the Aztecs as their ancient origin place.
That the Toltecs inaugurated the New Fire tradition at least 1,700 years ago and
the later Aztecs were still performing it proves that the cosmological traditions of
the earlier Toltecs were adopted by the later Aztecs. As a result, an interest in solar
zenith-passage dates as indicators of the zenith center was shared by both tradi¬
tions, which means both the Aztecs and the Toltecs ascribed to what I have termed
the Zenith Cosmology.
Within the Zenith Cosmology, the future convergence of the sun-Pleiades con¬
junction date with the local zenith-passage date was recognized by ancient cos
mologists as a rare alignment in the precessional cycle, and was thus thought of as
an era of historical, cultural, and spiritual change. For the Toltecs and the Aztecs,
the future synchronization of the sun and the Pleiades with the zenith was the
primary concern of the New Fire ceremony. The great anxiety for the Aztec peas¬
antry was that the world would end if the Pleiades failed to pass through the zenith
at midnight. However, I believe that the Aztec astronomer-priests knew that this
simply meant that they would then have to adjust one day forward for precession.
The ultimate target, the era of the great alignment, was what the end-times anxiety
was really about. We can distinguish here between the detailed scientific calcula¬
tions performed by the Aztec astronomer-priests and the generic message designed
to control the masses. As such, the populace was in great mortal terror during the
New Fire ceremony, not knowing the real story, while their astronomer-priests
carefully fine-tuned their alignment cosmology. The original Toltec "alignment
era" was targeted for a sun-Pleiades zenith passage to occur at the latitude of
Teotihuacan on May 18. This places the original Toltec alignment era in the late
eighteenth to the early nineteenth century. However, when the Toltecs transferred
their New Fire Zenith Cosmology to Chichen Itza, which is a little further north,
the era of the World Age shift was recalibrated to when the sun and the Pleiades
conjunct on May 20. This recalibration highlights our own era as being cosmologi
cally significant for Chichen Itza, because May 20 is when the sun and Pleiades
currently join in the zenith over the Pyramid of Kukulcan. The Toltec move to
Chichen may have been intentional because Chichen's latitude supplies the neces¬
sary solar zenith-passage date to bring the Zenith Cosmology into alignment with



THE TRUE MEANING OF THE TOLTEC NEW FIRE CEREMONY / 85
the 2012 end-date of the Galactic Cosmology. In this interpretation, the ancient
Mesoamerican need for correct orientation to the cosmic center may have driven
the Toltecs to relocate their headquarters to Chichen Itza.
EARTHQUAKES AND ENDINGS AT LATITUDE 19°40'N
The 19°N to 20°N latitude is significant for several reasons. As just described,
it is currently the latitude at which the sun-Pleiades-zenith alignment occurs. An¬
other reason for its importance involves geometry and the Earth grid. The latitude
and longitude lines used by mapmakers can be imagined as a grid system laid over
the Earth. Certain geometrical forms placed within the Earth sphere identify spe¬
cific latitudes as "sacred" places. The ley line theory of the sacred harmonic Earth
grid proposes that certain locations on the Earth's surface are power points derived
from spherical geometry. For example, the Earth's poles and the equator are funda¬
mental "power areas." As mentioned, certain geometrical shapes placed within the
Earth sphere define specific points or latitudes on the
Earth's surface where increased geophysical, magnetic,
or geothermal energy may be found. For example, the
base of an equilateral four-sided pyramid with a ver¬
tex on the South Pole reaches the 19°40'N latitude.
According to Earth-grid harmonics, the placement
of this geometric shape identifies the 19°40'N latitude
as a power band along which increased Earth energies
are found. An equilateral four-sided pyramid, like the
one in diagram 31, is a Platonic Solid, one of the few
three-dimensional forms derived from equilateral
shapes such as triangles and pentagons. These shapes
have a unique symmetry to them, and are constructed
from the sacred ratio called the Golden Mean, a math¬
ematical proportion used by the Egyptians in constructing the Great Pyramid.5 The
point here is that the science of Earth-grid harmonics highlights the 19°N to 20 N
latitude as a significant power place.
The Zenith Cosmology also focuses on the 19°N to 20°N latitude. The
sun-Pleiades-zenith alignment currently occurring at the 19°N to 20°N latitude
has meaning not only for Chichen Itza, but for Teotihuacan in Central Mexico,
Diagram 31. A Platonic Solid
points to latitude 19°40’N



86/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
where the ancient Toltecs devised the New Fire tradition. Both of these ancient
cities are within one degree of 19°40/N. There is something else very special about
this latitude, apart from the Earth-grid theory and the Zenith Cosmology. Geolo¬
gists have noted that the chain of high volcanic peaks in Central Mexico (which
occasionally threaten civilization in that region) lie on an east-west rift at latitude
19°30'N.6 These active volcanos include the smoldering Popocatepetl, which looms
over Mexico City and is the usual cause of earthquakes there. As such, a dangerous
volcanic fault line runs through Central Mexico at the 19o30'N latitude. Did the
ancient Toltecs know of this, and did they try to appease the volcanic Fire God in
order to delay the destruction of the Fifth Sun, the current World Age inaugurated
at ancient Teotihuacan?
The famous Aztec Sunstone encodes the meaning of the New Fire ceremony
and the fifty-two-year Calendar Round. It depicts five World Ages, each one de¬
stroyed by various natural cataclysms including floods, wind, and fire (see diagram
32).
The Fifth World Age, the one we are currently in, is portrayed in the center of
the Sunstone by the seventeenth day-sign, Ollin, which means "movement" or
"earthquake." The standard reading of this symbol is that the current World Age
will be destroyed by earthquakes. One begins to wonder about the astronomical
and geophysical focus on the 19°30'N latitude, supported by geophysical studies,
ley line theory, and the ancient Toltec Zenith Cosmology. Perhaps the Toltec pre¬
diction that the Fifth Sun will be destroyed by earthquakes has to do with an astro¬
nomical pressure applied to the unstable 19°30'N latitude that will catalyze volca¬
nic eruptions and earthquakes? If we were pressed to make a prediction based upon
these suggestive scientific facts and archaeological clues, we could suggest that
Mexico City will be destroyed by a violent earthquake in the early twenty-first
century. Perhaps the ancient Toltec Fire Priests are beginning to stir in their resting
places. Perhaps they feel the ancient prophecy is about to be fulfilled. And thus, the
most literal interpretation of the secret message hidden within the New Fire tradi¬
tion may, indeed, come to pass.

CHAPTER 8
ZENITH IMAGERY IN MESOAMERICA
W
e just explored how zenith passages and their relationship to the sun and
the Pleiades manifest at Chichen Itza. The zenith concept was most sig¬
nificant in the Toltec New Fire ceremony, in which the Pleiades were observed
passing through the zenith at midnight. But how widespread was the zenith con¬
cept? How old is it? In what other ways do zenith passages and the movements of
the Pleiades manifest in Mesoamerican art and ideas? How were solar zenith pas¬
sages portrayed, and what meanings did they have?
ZENITH TUBES AND CHULTUNES
Mesoamerican astronomers used several methods to track solar zenith pas¬
sages. One way was to measure the shadow cast from a vertical pole, called a gno¬
mon. When the sun is directly overhead, the pole casts no shadow. Another way
was to use a zenith tube, a deep vertical hole in the ground leading to an under¬
ground cave. When the sun is in the zenith, it projects a vertical beam onto the
floor of the underground chamber against which measurements are made. Struc¬
tures containing zenith tubes were found at Monte Alban and Xochicalco in Cen¬
tral Mexico. In the Yucatan, archaeologists found many bottle-shaped underground
89



90/ MAYA COSMOG E N E S I S 2012
chambers called chultunes, and it is still unclear what they may have been used for.
Maya ceremonialist Jim Reed, who has spent a great deal of time in the Yucatan,
told me that the local Maya believe you can climb into a chultune and, under cer¬
tain conditions, observe stars passing through the zenith in the middle of the day.
One wonders if some kind of refraction effect is possible, a phenomenon not under¬
stood by modern science. In one of those strange coincidences, I encountered a
passage in my reading that provided a precedent for this "daytime telescope." In his
opus Dialogue on the Great World Systems, Galileo Galilei, in referring to the
activities of Aristotle, wrote, "Having his works brought, he turned to the place
where the philosopher gives the reason why, from the bottom of a very deep well,
one may see the stars in heaven at noonday."1 Perhaps chultunes served as daytime
zenith tubes.
SUN-PLEIADES-ZENITH IN MESOAMERICAN THOUGHT
As mentioned earlier, the Aztecs (and the earlier Toltecs) observed the passage
of the Pleiades through the zenith at midnight. My own interpretation of this, con¬
sidering the exactitude implied by the precise midnight observation, is that this
observation was used to define the exact date of the sun-Pleiades conjunction six
months later, in May. In Mesoamerican thought, the zenith concept is inextricably
related to the movements of the sun and the Pleiades. In fact, there is evidence in
the Madrid Codex, one of the few surviving Maya books, that the Maya were inter¬
ested in the conjunction of the Pleiades with the first zenith-passage date of the
sun.2 As noted in Part I, the horizon position of the Pleiades on the May zenith
passage date defined the orientation of that great early Mesoamerican city, Teoti
huacan, built in the first century a.d. This zenith-Pleiades relationship is an an¬
cient concept, and probably was pioneered at Izapa around 100 b.c.3 Archaeo
astronomer Anthony Aveni wrote that it has been suggested that the "zenith prin¬
ciple" was discovered at Izapa and passed along to Copan, which is on the same
latitude.4
As I explained earlier, the Toltecs and the Aztecs thought of the zenith as a
cosmic center and in keeping with common Mesoamerican doctrine, they believed
cosmogenesis occurs at a cosmic center identified by a celestial cross.5 According
to one scholar, the Maya believed "... in the cross as a symbol of the first solar
zenith sun. . . ."6 This symbology identifies the May solar zenith passage as a



ZENITH IMAGERY IN MESOAMERICA/91
"cross-shaped target" for a World Age doctrine involving the zenith and the Pleia¬
des. This World Age doctrine is not a mystery—it is the New Fire ceremony. The
zenith-cross is the marker into which the sun and Pleiades move, signaling the
rebirth of the world and, as suggested in the previous chapter, the return of
Quetzalcoatl.
In my reconstruction of the astronomical content of the New Fire ceremony,
the sun-Pleiades conjunction event in May was calculated with the midnight ze¬
nith passage of the Pleiades in November. According to one scholarly interpreta¬
tion, the November New Fire observation is "the binary opposite of the May event."7
However, the scholars who have looked at this relationship do not acknowledge
an exact six-month opposition, although this degree of precision is suggested by
the midnight zenith passage. Instead, they consider the sun-Pleiades conjunction
to include the entire six-week period of the Pleiades's invisibility during inferior
conjunction8 and thus they miss the true meaning of the New Fire ceremony. If
scholars had allowed for greater precision, the opposition between the mid
November observation of the midnight zenith passage of the Pleiades versus the
sun-Pleiades conjunction in mid-May would be made more distinct. As a result,
the convergence between the sun-Pleiades and the solar zenith-passage date (a few
days later) would be highlighted as an alignment in precession recognized by the
ancient astronomers.
This brief recapitulation of the Zenith Cosmology in Mesoamerican thought
makes several facts clear. The zenith concept is ancient. The sun and the Pleiades
were both involved in the observation of zenith-passage dates. Knowledge of pre¬
cession is implicit in how Mesoamerican astronomers tracked these dates, and it
was encoded into and was measured with the New Fire ceremony, which was ob¬
served at the end of each fifty-two-year Calendar Round. In addition, Maya kings
timed important ceremonies to coincide with solar and Pleiadian zenith passages.
SERPENT-FOOTED SCEPTORS: SYMBOLS OF KINGSHIP
The Maya were interested in the date on which the Pleiades first rose before
the sun in the east (its heliacal rise). There is also evidence that Maya kings timed
their accession to rulership to coincide with solar zenith passages as well as
sun-Pleiades conjunctions. A king from Tikal named Ah Cacau acceded to the throne
on May 1, 682 a.d. The sun and the Pleiades were conjunct on this date.9 What's



92 / MAYA COSMOGENE5IS 2012
more, Ah Cacau is depicted on Tikal Temple I, Lintel
3, enthroned and holding a serpent-footed sceptor of
rulership. These serpent- footed images are quite abun¬
dant in Mesoamerican art, and are said to represent God
K of the Maya pantheon, otherwise known as Kawil.
In the serpent-footed sceptor examples shown, each
tail forms an elaborate deity. Instead of saying "serpent¬
footed deity" we might just as well say "deity-tailed
serpent," and that exactly describes the shadow-snake
that appears on the Pyramid of Kukulcan. The inverted
rattlesnake's tail contains the combined symbols of the
sun (the little solar face on Crotalus durissus d.) and
the Pleiades (tzab, the rattle), and points up to the ze¬
nith. If the deity-tailed serpents on the sceptors of
rulership are rattlesnakes and are associated with the
snake mythology at Chichen Itza, we may be able to
deduce the astronomical identity of the deity on their tails. Like Quetzalcoatl, God
K (Kawil), as portrayed on these sceptors, may represent the combined energies of
the sun and the Pleiades when they pass through the zenith.10 If we consult the
charts in Appendix 3, which show when and where this zenith convocation oc¬
curred throughout Mesoamerican history, we find that it took place at the latitude
of Tikal during the thirteenth century a.d. As such, rulers like Ah Cacau, who
lived in the seventh century a.d., in associating themselves with the profound
celestial hierophany of the Zenith Cosmology, may have been proclaiming them¬
selves to be emissaries of the future return of the Plumed Serpent.
Kawil was a one-footed deity, and is equivalent to the Quiche god Tojil, who,
in the Popol Vuh, spins upon one foot to light a fire. Both of them were probably
envisioned as occupants of the zenith center. Hunrakan, another one-footed deity
in the Popol Vuh, is thought to occupy either the polar center or the zenith. Among
the Aztecs, Tezcatlipoca (the dark twin of Quetzalcoatl) is a one-footed deity, and
he spins upon the Pole Star. In these astronomical identities there is an apparent
conflict between two centers—the Pole Star and the zenith. However, the mytho¬
logical imagery is transferrable. In other words, the concept of the one-footed deity
associated with the cosmic center was preserved, whereas the actual location of the
cosmic center was debatable.

The accession of the Maya king Bird Jaguar is re¬
corded on Yaxchilan Lintel 30 as occurring on 11 Ahau
8 Zee 9.16.1.0.0, which is May 1, 752 a.d.—the date of a
sun-Pleiades conjunction. Bird Jaguar is shown holding
a serpent-footed sceptor. Elsewhere, on Lintel 41, Bird
Jaguar holds a long vertical pole. The date on this lintel
is May 7, 755 a.d.—a solar zenith-passage date at the
latitude of Yaxchilan. According to Maya scholar Arthur
Schlak, the vertical spear or staff held in these depic¬
tions is a gnomon used for identifying the "no-shadow"
date of solar zenith passage.11 Diagram 34 depicts such a
zenith-passage measuring staff.
Monuments dated in the Long Count calendar fre¬
quently record astronomical events. Records of eclipse
dates and Venus risings are quite common. How¬
ever, scholars

have frequently
neglected to rec¬
ognize solar ze

dates and sun-Pleiades conjunction dates in
Long Count inscriptions. I just related ex¬
amples from Yaxchilan and Tikal, and here
are a few more: Stela 10 from Xultun records
the date 10.3.0.0.0, on which the sun and
the Pleiades were in conjunction. Katun
9.16.0.0.0 fell near a solar zenith passage at
Tikal. Katuns 9.15, 9.16, and 9.17 all have
Mars and the Pleiades conjunct, but only
9.16 also fell near a solar zenith passage.
Chan Bahlum, son of the Palenque king
Pacal, celebrated his thirty-third birthday by
recognizing the solar zenith passage and the
Pleiades. According to Arthur Schlak, the
kilt in diagram 35 symbolizes the Pleiades



94/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
and the upright staff denotes a solar zenith passage.12 These examples prove that
the Maya considered it propitious to coordinate important ceremonies with solar
zenith-passage dates and sun-Pleiades conjunctions. The serpent-footed sceptor,
which appears to signify the accepting of kingship (accession to the cosmic center),
resembles the serpent-shadow that appears on Kukulcan's pyramid at Chichen Itza.
Given this association, the serpent-footed sceptor, as a symbol of divine power and
rulership, probably symbolizes the sun-Pleiades-zenith alignment and bestows
Quetzalcoatl's blessing upon those chosen to hold it.
INVERTED SERPENT COLUMNS AND YEAR-BEARERS
Additional symbols found in Maya art suggest that the inverted serpent sym¬
bol also represents the beginning and ending of time cycles. At the ruins of Chichen
Itza, many "serpent column portals" were found, carved from local stone. Gener¬
ally, these are inverted snakes, heads at the bottom, tails up in the air, which
served either as functional supports for platform-altars or as decorations on the
sides of buildings. Along with the so-called "Atlantean columns" present at
Chichen Itza, serpent columns also were found at the Central Mexican site of
Tula, a Toltec site with many similarities to
Chichen Itza. The serpent columns at Chichen
Itza bring to mind the solar shadow-image that
appears on the equinox.
I described earlier how the symbology of the
upward-pointing rattlesnake tail was intended to
indicate a sun-Pleiades conjunction in the zenith.
The abundance of the same image in stone, as a
decorative and functional convention, suggests
that the inverted rattlesnake was a well-under¬
stood mythological motif. Mayanist George
Kubler studied the serpent columns at Chichen Itza and wrote, "Most directly re¬
lated to the serpent-columns are their sky-bearer capitals [representatives]."13 In
other words, since serpent columns serve as platform corner supports, they repre¬
sent the four "pillars of the cosmos." Therefore, the serpent columns correspond to
the directional bacab (sky-bearers), which in turn are related to the four calendric
year-bearers. New Year's Day—the first day of the 365-day haab—always occurred
Diagram 36. Serpent column (left)
and Atlantean columns (right) from
Chichen Itza



ZENITH IMAGERY IN MESOAMERICA / 95
on one of these calendric year-bearers. Considering that the Yucatec Maya New
Year's Day was celebrated, at the time of the Conquest, on one of the solar
zenith-passage dates, we can easily understand how serpent columns are thus sub¬
stitute symbols for the year-bearer, for New Year's Day.
Also, the Pyramid of Kukulcan at Chichen Itza has
ninety-one steps on each of its four sides, making a total of
364 "base" steps. The 365th step—or "day"—is at the very
top of the pyramid, in the zenith position. Now imagine
turning this metaphor upside-down, so that the zenith is
the first day—New Year's Day—and one descends the pyra¬
mid by spiraling down the remaining 364 steps, or days.
Here we have confirmed the idea that the cosmic cen¬
ter (the zenith), being associated with New Year's Day, is
an important beginning point for time. With the first day
of the solar year located at the top of the pyramid—in the
central zenith direction—we are also reminded that time
begins in and, ultimately, returns to the cosmic center.
Another important mythological serpent was known as Hapaycan, derived from
the Yucatec Maya verb hap, which means "to open the mouth, swallow, absorb."14
In a reference from the sixteenth-century Motul dictionary, hapaknak u chi’ means
"open like a viper's mouth." The stem -nak also has the meaning of "throne," and
nak is the sound-inversion of kan, which means "serpent, four, and sky." (Sound
inversion words are from the language of Zuvuya, a mystical poetry developed by
Yucatec Maya shamans.)
Given these symbolic connections, in some essential sense the serpent's open
mouth is related to the concept of the throne. The idea of "mouth as throne" makes
sense when we understand that the crossroads mark the cosmic center, the cross
indicates the doorway into another world, and these doorways were envisioned as
"mouths." Most importantly, kings were enthroned on cross-marked thrones, and
were intended to symbolically occupy the cosmic center. As discussed previously,
serpent and jaguar mouths were both understood as portals to the Underworld. The
ubiquitous Mesoamerican motif of solar kings emerging from snakes' mouths is
thus a statement of rulership, stating in effect, "I am the newly born king, en¬
throned in the mouth of the Otherworld."
Yet another family of serpent-forms at Chichen Itza is called Xiuhcoatl, which
Diagram 37. Spiraling

can. Four directions, 365
steps, zenith in the cen¬
ter (the top)



96/ MAYA CO SMOG E N E S I S 2012
Diagram 38. Solar king
emerging from a snake’s mouth
literally means "blue serpent."15 According to Kubler, in
the imagery of Highland Mexico, the source of Chichen
tradition, "Xiuhcoatl appears often as a descending serpent
with trapezoidal overlapping body segments, and the rat¬
tler tail converted into the 'year-sign7 of trapeze and tri¬
angle."16 This important symbolic connection confirms
what I proposed earlier: The Pleiades (the snake's rattle)
represents the year-bearer. This association makes sense
when we remember that the Pleiades was observed in the
New Fire ceremony, passing through the zenith at the be¬
ginning of the Calendar Round cycle. These related con¬
cepts support my
theory that the con¬
vergence of the Pleiades with a solar zenith
passage date (one of which was New Year's
Day) underlies the World Age doctrine at Chi¬
chen Itza, and it was encoded into the Pyra¬
mid of Kukulcan.
In diagram 39, we see the rattle (the Ple¬
iades) transformed into the Central Mexican
symbol for the year-bearer. Since the primary
year-bearer at Chichen Itza coincided with a
solar zenith-passage date, the coincidence of
"sun, Pleiades, and zenith" implies questions
that my Chichen hypothesis already answers.17
Notice that further up the serpent's tail are
four bundles, which symbolize the four solar
year-bearers. As with the "solar face" near the Ciotalus durissus rattlesnake's rattle,
here we have combined imagery depicting a united sun and Pleiades. As mentioned,
the concept of the zenith is also present in this imagery.
On the famous Aztec Sunstone, there are two Xiuhcoatl snakes rimming the
perimeter of the stone. Their heads meet at the bottom, and the headdress of each
contains seven stars—the seven stars of the Pleiades (see diagram 40).
The body of each Xiuhcoatl serpent is divided into eleven segments in which
can be seen the flames representing the New Fire. But why eleven segments? Since
Diagram 39. The Xiuhcoatl serpent with
year-sign tail (left). Examples of Aztec
trapezoidal year-signs (right)



ZENITH IMAGERY IN MESOAMERKA / 97
each block represents a New Fire (i.e., a Calendar
Round period of fifty-two years), the total number
of years per serpent is thus 11 x 52 = 572. Signifi¬
cantly, 572 years equal 8 periods of 71.5 years, which
is roughly the amount of time it takes for one de¬
gree, or day, of precessional shifting. Within the New
Fire tradition's concern for making precessional ad¬
justments, an even eight days of correction for every
eleven New Fire ceremonies could have been imple¬
mented. This whole number accounting is com¬
pletely in keeping with the Mesoamerican interest in finding whole number corn
mensuration between time cycles, rather than using fractions, and results in a very
accurate precessional cycle value of 25,740 years.

THE TRAPEZOIDAL YEAR-SIGN: AN ASTRONOMICAL
INSTRUMENT
How else might the Central Mexican year-sign be related to the zenith? In
pursuing this line of inquiry, we must review what we have discovered so far. What
will emerge is an underlying pattern that unites all the seemingly unrelated sym¬
bols we have been discussing. To begin, the trap¬
ezoidal year-sign form is not limited exclusively
to Central Mexico. The "trapezoid instrument"
has been identified at Uxmal, Copan, Piedras
Negras, and other Maya sites.18
The year-sign is usually attached to the head
of a deity figure, but can also be found elsewhere,
for example, on the lower back of a figure from
Tehuacan (see diagram 42).
In addition, at Uxmal archaeologists found
many faces in the form of the trapezoidal year
sign, called "Tlaloc images."19 Many of these had
Diagram 41. The trapezoidal year-sign year-signs for ears, in addition to one on the fore

motif of the Olmec20 and the "witz mountain/7 which symbol¬
izes the "broken place, bitter water place" where corn was born
(according to the Popol Vuh).
I have already pointed out the connection between the
year-sign tail of the Xiuhcoatl serpent and the Yucatec rattle¬
snake rattle. Since tzab (the rattle) is also the word for the Pleia¬
des in Yucatec Maya, I noted a connection between the Pleiades
and New Year's Day (symbolized by the year-sign "tail"). In addi¬
tion, since New Year's Day was celebrated on one of the solar
zenith-passage dates in the Yucatan, a connection between the
Pleiades and New Year's Day is implicit. This association cycles
back to, and is supported by, the basic fact that in the New Fire
ceremony (at the beginning of not just any year but the fifty
two-year Calendar Round) the Pleiades was carefully observed
passing through the zenith at midnight. Thus, the related transformations include
the Pleiades, the rattlesnake rattle, the year-sign, New Year's Day, and the zenith.
The Central Mexican year-sign is directly related to the zenith by way of an
interesting discovery offered by Maya scholar Adrian Digby. Digby found that the
trapezoidal year-sign symbol portrays an "unrecognized astronomical instrument."21
He reconstructs two versions of what the shadow-casting trapezoid instrument
looked like, one based upon a drawing from the Pyramid of the Plumed Serpent at
Xochicalco and the other from Tenango. As
mentioned earlier, there is a zenith tube at
Xochicalco, clearly demonstrating that solar
zenith passages were of interest there.
Digby tracked the shadows cast by these
reconstructed three-dimensional trapezoid
"year-signs" on the solstices and the equinoxes.
He found that the patterns formed could be used
to keep very accurate solar observations.
Clearly, although Digby did not emphasize this,
the instrument is perfectly suited for identify¬
ing solar zenith-passage dates, on which the
zenith sun will project a simple cross downward
from the trapezoidal "crosshairs." In fact, this
Diagram 43. Trapezoidal year-sign de¬
signs projected into three dimensions
become shadow-casting astronomical
instruments



ZENITH IMAGERY IN MESOAMERIGA / 99
cross is explicitly portrayed below the trap¬
ezoidal year-sign glyph found on the Pyra¬
mid of the Plumed Serpent at Xochicalco.
The shadow-cross is none other than the
quadripartite "quincunx" design, which por¬
trays the four directions with the fifth—the
zenith—in the center.
This shadow-symbol on the Pyramid of
the Plumed Serpent at Xochicalco is similar in nature to the serpent-shadow on the
Pyramid of Kukulcan at Chichen Itza. Remember, the Plumed Serpent (Quetzalcoatl)
is the Central Mexican version of the Yucatec Maya deity known as Kukulcan.
Since the Xochicalco and Chichen Itza pyramids were both used as zenith calen¬
dars, the fact that both are dedicated to the same deity is no doubt significant. At
Xochicalco, the trapezoidal year-sign with the zenith-passage indicator projected
below it (the shadow cross), when combined with the Pleiades/rattle/year-sign
symbol-complex, suggests only one scenario: the Pleiades and the sun in the ze¬
nith on New Year’s Day. This is precisely the event that occurs at Chichen Itza.22
Clearly, the Zenith Cosmology involving the sun, the Pleiades, and the zenith was
shared between Central Mexico and Chichen Itza.

on the meaning of the serpent's rattle, should now be clear. The astronomical refer¬
ence is to the Pleiades and, in related symbology, to the year-bearer (New Year's
Day), which was celebrated in the Yucatan on one of the solar zenith-passage dates.
But what about the other end of the snake, its mouth? We have already seen that
the mouth of the Hapaycan snake deity was akin to a throne. In Mesoamerican art
and iconography, deities are often shown emerging (or being born) from serpent
mouths. At Chichen Itza the mouth of the shadow-serpent points to the nearby
cenote, as if that is its destination. Both the serpent's mouth and the cenote were
considered to be portals to the Underworld.
We should remember that the Quiche Maya call the dark-rift in the Milky Way
(located near Scorpio and Sagittarius) a doorway to the Underworld. South Ameri¬
can mythlore related to the Scorpio constellation might help us clarify Mesoamerican

lOO / MAYA C0 5M0GENESIS 2012 M
concepts. The Barasana people of North¬
western Amazonia recognize a polarity be¬
tween the Pleiades (called nyokoara, Star
Thing) and Scorpius. An ethnographic study
of Barasana star lore reveals: "A snake con¬
stellation identified with Scorpius is found
throughout the Vaupes region and, in many
parts of Amazonia, Scorpius is identified
with Boiassu, the Great Serpent."23 The
polarity is a function of the roughly opposed
rising and setting times of the Pleiades and
Scorpio throughout the agricultural year. Although these two constellations are
not precisely 180° apart, their polarity is functional in terms of seasonal activities
and observations. Ethnographer Gary Urton
identified a similar Pleiades-Scorpius polarity
among the highland Quechua in Peru, in which
both constellations are understood as collcas,
or storehouses.24
But what do these South American tradi¬
tions have to do with Chichen Itza? And what
does Scorpio have to do with the mouth of a
serpent? The South American material on the
Pleiades-Scorpius polarity suggests a perspec¬
tive that any agricultural people might adopt,
and suggests a way we can understand the Ple¬
iades rattle and the opposed snake-mouth in
Yucatec cosmology.25 Scorpius is near Sagittarius, both are near the Milky Way,
and, more to the point, both are very close to the dark-rift in the Milky Way. The
illustration above from Johann Bayer's seventeenth-century astronomical treatise,
Uranometria, demonstrates the close relationship between the Scorpion constella¬
tion (especially its tail) and the dark-rift "mouth" in the Milky Way snake.
In this illustration, the stars of Sagittarius are just above and to the left of the
tail of Scorpius, and the dark-rift in the Milky Way is clearly visible. The band of
the Milky Way is roughly 10° wide and is tolerably close to both Sagittarius and
Scorpio. This is the area of the Milky Way where the Galactic Center is located. In

Nicaraguan and Maya mythology, the Mother Scorpion at the end of the Milky Way
is located in Scorpio26 and her tail is identical to the scorpion's tail in diagram 46.
That the Scorpion Mother, who houses the souls of the dead and the unborn, is
located in the region of the Galactic Center is significant, as it suggests the Central
American Indians deified the Galactic Center as a birthplace or Otherworld store¬
house of souls.
The Scorpio tail is very close to the dark-rift "mouth." The Pleiades, on the
other side of the sky, were thought of as a rattlesnake rattle, or tail, and this
tail-mouth polarity is connected by the Milky Way. The Pleiades are fairly close to
where the Milky Way crosses through Gemini, and, of course, the dark-rift mouth
in the Milky Way is near Sagittarius-Scorpio. If we bring these facts back, to our
thesis of multiple cosmic centers, we can piece together what may be a lost para¬
digm. If the Pleiades (the snake's rattle) reveals one type of cosmic center (the ze¬
nith) and the dark-rift in the Milky Way (the snake's mouth) conceals another cos¬
mic center (the Galactic Center), a complex cosmological model uniting the zenith
center with the Galactic Center seems in order. Although it is still a stretch to say
with any certainty that the inverted serpent-columns at Chichen Itza, with their
tail-mouth polarity, encode this interpretation, they just might. An advanced sha
manistic paradigm? A sophisticated cosmogonic map involving skylore lost for cen¬
turies? There may be a lot more to Kukulcan than we have been led to believe. In
fact, these very considerations are what led me to suspect Chichen Itza as the place
where the Zenith Cosmology and the Galactic Cosmology were synthesized.
We have traced meaningful connections between many symbolic motifs that
relate to zenith imagery. It is often necessary to wade through the academic data
and synthesize what is really going on. Our search has uncovered significant rela¬
tionships between the solar zenith passage, the Pleiades, the year-sign, New Year's
Day, and the Kukulcan-Quetzalcoatl deity that contribute to elucidating the nature
of the Zenith Cosmology in Mesoamerica. The associations can be summed up as
follows:
• The snake's rattle (tzab) refers to the Pleiades.
• The Pleiades and the New Fire ceremony are related to solar zenith pas¬
sages.
• In the Yucatan, a solar zenith-passage date was celebrated as New Year's
Day around the time of the Conquest.



102 / MAYA COSMOGENESI5 2012
• Maya kings coordinated important rituals to occur on solar zenith-passage
dates and sun-Pleiades conjunctions.
• Serpent-footed sceptors of rulership may have represented the sun
Pleiades-zenith event, which in turn symbolized Quetzalcoatl (sun-Pleiades)
taking his throne in the zenith.
• Inverted serpent columns are secondary symbols for the directional bacab
and the year-bearer symbols of New Year's Day.
• The Central Mexican trapezoidal year-sign depicts an astronomical instru¬
ment suited to identifying solar zenith-passage dates, gives rise to the ubiq¬
uitous quincunx design, and is found on the tail of the Xiuhcoatl snake.
• The Hapaycan snake's mouth refers, by sound inversion, to the concept of a
deity-ruler's throne. (The serpent's mouth is the portal to the Otherworld
and is the place where Maya kings are reborn upon taking their throne of
office.)
• As suggested by South American examples and Mesoamerican clues, a po¬
larity between the Pleiades and Scorpio may have been recognized in
Mesoamerican cosmology. In this interpretation, the serpent's mouth (the
dark-rift near Scorpio) was counterposed to the serpent's tail (the Pleiades),
and the Milky Way was the Great Serpent that unites them.
So, what is really going on in all this? First, a Zenith Cosmology existed through¬
out Mesoamerica. The Pyramid of Kukulcan is the most clear and profound ex¬
ample of the Zenith Cosmology, a cosmic myth in stone. The symbolic connec¬
tions between all of these snake motifs, the Pleiades, and year-bearer signs cannot
be coincidence, and my interpretation of how they were synthesized makes sense
in terms of what scholars already know about Mesoamerican traditions. Further¬
more, the related concepts I have sketched suggest a kind of Maya "unified theory"
that connects two cosmic centers—the zenith and the Galactic Center—via the
Milky Way serpent-tree axis.27
TWO COSMOLOGIES UNITED?
Mesoamerican cosmologists must have organized and ordered the complicated
relationships among these metaphors into a profound cosmological system. Chichen
Itza preserves a lost method of tracking the precession of the equinoxes that I call



ZENITH IMAGERY IN MESOAMERIGA / 103
the Zenith Cosmology. But we can't separate the Zenith Cosmology from other
facets of Mesoamerican cosmology, namely, the overwhelmingly important cos¬
mology of the end-date, the Galactic Cosmology. The presence of the Galactic Cos¬
mology at Chichen Itza is undeniable, hidden within the symbols and myths we
have been discussing—for example, the dark-rift "mouth" of the snake. In the next
three chapters we will explore the underlying astronomy and mythology of the
Galactic Cosmology in more detail.
What seems to be emerging from our examination of Mesoamerican mytho
astronomy is a complex and extremely sophisticated paradigm in which the Zenith
Cosmology of the Toltecs was somehow unified with the Galactic Cosmology of
the Maya Long Count calendar. The World Age calendar utilized in the Zenith
Cosmology was the Calendar Round, whereas the Galactic Alignment to occur in
a.d. 2012 was tracked with the Long Count calendar. Evidence suggests that the
Mesoamerican cosmologists were interested in unifying these two systems. What¬
ever this was about, it seems to have taken place at Chichen Itza. In the final chap¬
ter of this part of the book, we will return to Chichen Itza and explore how and why
Chichen was the place where the Zenith Cosmology and the Galactic Cosmology
were unified.
Long before Chichen Itza emerged as the place of reconciliation, almost a mil¬
lennium before the Pyramid of Kukulcan was built, the Long Count calendar was
invented by the Izapan culture in southern Chiapas. Why do I call the Long Count
calendar a "Galactic Cosmology"? What exactly is involved in the astronomy of its
end-date in a.d. 2012? It is time we took a closer look at the astronomy of a.d. 2012
and the area of the sky involved in the end-date, for the Scorpio-Sagittarius region
contains many stellar mysteries, ones that the ancient Maya gazed into deeply.

CHAPTER 9
THE LONG COUNT:
GALACTIC ALIGNMENT IN 2012
O
ver 2,000 years ago, ancient cosmonauts in southern Mesoamerica invented
the Long Count calendar. They began dating carved monuments with this
calendar in the first century b.c. The Long Count calendar is a galactic calendar
because it pinpoints a rare alignment with our Milky Way Galaxy, due to occur in
a.d. 2012—a date written as 13.0.0.0.0 in the Long Count. As we have seen, as¬
tronomy and mythology are deeply interwoven in how the ancient skywatchers
thought about this Galactic Alignment, and the Maya Creation myth, the Popol
Vuh, encodes the astronomy of the end-date, depicting it as a time of great transfor¬
mation and world rebirth. And look around us, we do live in an era of great transfor¬
mation. Space flight, computers, and sophisticated data technology have all emerged
in the last fifty years. It does seem that human civilization is being propelled into
increasingly complex forms of organization. Time, in a sense, is accelerating. Inno¬
vative changes are occurring at a faster and faster rate as we approach the 2012 date.
Human civilization is transforming at a rate without precedence. The ancient Maya
believed that our impending alignment with the Galactic Center is responsible for
this transformation. However, modern science does not recognize any connection
between the current state of the world and the larger galactic context. Could it be
that the ancient Maya were privy to a cosmological knowledge that we are just
beginning to understand?
THE FACTS OF THE MATTER
Let us take a look at the astronomy involved in the end-date alignment. What
105



106/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
astronomical features are involved? Where exactly is the Galactic Center, and how
can we visualize the 2012 alignment?
The 13-baktun cycle end-date of the Long Count calendar (December 21, 2012)
pinpoints a rare astronomical alignment determined by the precession of the equi¬
noxes. The alignment occurs when the December solstice sun conjuncts the cross¬
ing point of the Milky Way and the ecliptic in Sagittarius. This crossing point is
where the dark-rift in the Milky Way is located, and it is known to the Quiche
Maya as the xibalba be (the Road to the Underworld) or simply "the Black Road."
Maya scholars have identified the nearby crossing point of the Milky Way and the
ecliptic as the Maya Sacred Tree, and the modern Quiche call that spot the "Cross¬
roads." In short, the Creation Place was believed to exist at a cosmic crossroads.
And the Galactic Center, the true Creation Place, is found right next to the cross
formed by the Milky Way and the ecliptic.
Underlying the importance of the 2012 end-date is an astronomical process,
the precession of the equinoxes. Having already explained how precession works in
Part I, I would like to review here how precession was tracked. As explained earlier,
precessional tracking involves the identification of foreground and background fea¬
tures in the sky. Foreground features include the seasonal quarters (the equinoxes
and solstices), that is, the sidereal position of the solstice or equinox sun. Back¬
ground features against which the precessional movement of the foreground fea¬
tures can be tracked include stars, constellations, and the Milky Way. The 2012
alignment involves specific astronomical features: the Milky Way, the Galactic
Center, the dark-rift in the Milky Way, the December solstice sun, and the ecliptic.
What exactly are these, and how are they related?
THE MILKY WAY
The Milky Way is a perfect background marker for precession. When we go
outside on a moonless night, preferably far away from the light pollution of cities,
we look up and see the breathtaking expanse of the Milky Way across the sky.
When we see the Milky Way, we are actually looking out along the edge of our own
galaxy. Since we are within our galaxy, the Milky Way appears to circle the entire
sky, and if we look at the Milky Way at different times of the year, we can chart its
different forms. We will notice that the area of the Milky Way that crosses through
the constellation Gemini is relatively thin and diffuse. In comparison, on the oppo

Diagram 47. Our Galaxy and its central bulge, compared with spiral galaxy below
site side of the sky from
Gemini—in Sagittarius and
Scorpio—the Milky Way is
very bright and quite wide.
The bright, wide, and dense
part of the Milky Way that
crosses through Sagittarius
and Scorpio is where the Ga¬
lactic Center is located—that
hyperdense region out of which the Milky Way and everything in it, including us,
has poured.
Notice the Milky Way's central bulge in the diagram above. This is the bright
and wide part of the Milky Way that runs through Sagittarius. It makes us think of
an engorged, womblike area, easily giving rise to the idea that the Milky Way is a
huge, pregnant being, and the central bulge is thus the womb or birthplace of the
sky. The Maya understood this dense, bright bulge as a Cosmic Center and Cre¬
ation Place, a conclusion based solely upon naked-eye observation that is, in fact,
very true: The center of our saucer-shaped Galaxy lies within this bright and wide
part of the Milky Way.
THE ECLIPTIC
The ecliptic, which is roughly 14° wide, is the path followed by the sun, moon,
and planets. The Maya saw the ecliptic as a double-headed serpent, as frequently
portrayed in Maya sculpture and art.1 It is a foreground feature, and the four "sta¬
tions" along the ecliptic—the two solstices and two equinoxes—are important
markers. Their slow movement toward the Milky Way is an indication of the phe¬
nomenon of precession. Where is the ecliptic in the sky? Where is the ecliptic in
relation to the Milky Way? These are important questions. The ecliptic crosses the
Milky Way through the constellations of Gemini and Sagittarius at roughly a 60°
angle. When we discuss Maya Creation mythology in the next chapter, it will be
important to remember that there are two areas in the sky, opposite each other,
where a cross is formed by the Milky Way and the ecliptic. The cross in Sagittarius
is the one that concerns us right now.
This cross is recognized by the Maya and the Indians of South America today.



108 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 20M
The ancient Maya called it
the Sacred Tree, and it is de¬
picted on Pacal's sarcopha¬
gus lid at Palenque. Notice
that the ecliptic crosses over
the Milky Way near its cen¬
tral bulge. But why? There is
no law of physics that says
it has to. This drawing in¬
volves the relationship be¬
tween a local foreground fea¬
ture (the ecliptic) and a dis¬
tant background feature (the
Milky Way). Astrophysi¬
cists, when confronted with
the fact that the ecliptic crosses over the Milky Way near its central bulge, con¬
sider it a coincidence. However, because the Milky Way can be thought of as an
enormous magnet, we might postulate some kind of magnetic field "entrainment"
to explain it. At any rate, the ecliptic's location is quite fortuitous, as it allows the
celestial "deities" traveling along the ecliptic to come into periodic conjunction
with the central bulge
of the Milky Way—the
great galactic power
station itself. As for the
ecliptic's solar "sta¬
tions"—the equinoxes
and solstices—these
approach the Galactic
Center very slowly, and
Maya astronomers con

sidered the eras in which these quarter-stations conjunct the Milky Way through
its center to be transformative, signaling a World Age shift. These eras of transfor¬
mative shift, affecting all life on planet Earth, include a.d. 2012, 4500 b.c., 10,800
b.c., and 17,300 b.c. According to Maya cosmology, which recognizes the Decem¬
ber solstice as the most important solar station, a.d. 2012 represents the most
significant of these four possible eras.
Star charts such as Norton’s 2000.02 allow us to plot where the ecliptic crosses
over the Milky Way (see diagram 49). To seek exact precision would be inappropri¬
ate because, you may remember, the ecliptic path is 14° wide. However, we can
afford to be a little more precise because the sun's path along the ecliptic is less
subject to variation than the planets' paths along it.
In addition to the width of the ecliptic, the width of the Milky Way allows an
expanded range for the crossover zone, but we can use the precise meridian of the
Galactic equator to chart diagram 49. As previously discussed, a very significant
feature of the Milky Way runs right along the Galactic equator—the dark-rift.
THE DARK-RIFT
The dark-rift, also called the Great Cleft, is a dark band running along the
Milky Way. It begins where the ecliptic crosses the Milky Way in Sagittarius and
stretches some distance northward, past the constellation of Aquila. The dark-rift
is created by interstellar dust clouds, so prevalent in that dense region near the
Milky Way's central bulge, and it can be seen in diagram 48. The Indians of South
America recognize many dark-cloud forms within the Milky Way, one of which is
the pregnant llama. This formation happens to be quite close to the central bulge,
thus reinforcing the idea that the central bulge was recognized in indigenous
cosmologies as a fertile Creation Place or cosmic womb. The Maya recognize the
dark-rift as a Road to the Underworld, which is a very important element in Maya
Creation mythology. It was seen as a passageway into the central bulge of the Milky
Way, the cosmic "Otherworld" of the Creation Place.
Where exactly is the dark-rift? Does it actually touch the crossing-point in
Sagittarius? These are difficult questions, because there are variations in how the
Milky Way and its dark clouds are represented in star charts and computer soft¬
ware. Even planetariums do not provide unambiguous data. It is best to go into the
field and chart the position of the dark-rift, with special attention to its southern



IIO / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
terminus. The months of July and August provide optimal viewing, and in the
United States the high mountains of Colorado provide clear stargazing conditions.
The "edges'7 of the dark-rift vary with viewing conditions, especially ambient light
caused by distant cities and the moon's varying phases. The ancient Maya astrono¬
mers enjoyed optimum stargazing conditions, comparable to or even better than
what is possible today in the Rocky Mountains. On August 5, 1996,1 was camping
in the Holy Cross wilderness area near Leadville, at 11,400 feet. The night sky was
ablaze with stars, and I had a beautiful view of the Great Cleft and Sagittarius. The
experience was awesome, and I breathed in and felt the infinite depth of black sky
that loomed above me. Jupiter was 8° east of the crossing point, and using other
stars as markers, I was able to get a good map of the extent of the Milky Way and
the dark-rift. I can attest that a saucer-shaped mind-map of the Milky Way can be
constructed from naked-eye observations and that the idea that the Milky Way is
a uniformly wide band is false.3 Combin¬
ing all the charting tools available, espe¬
cially the field observations made in Au¬
gust 1996,1 have come up with a good posi¬
tional map of the dark-rift near the cross¬
ing point.
From my observations, the darkest
area of the dark-rift does appear to be some¬
what north of the ecliptic. The Great Cleft
is quite wide at this point. Tracing it far¬
ther north, it extends well beyond Aquila
as its width decreases. The southern ter¬
minus of the dark-rift is somewhat ambigu¬
ous; there is not a clear division between
the darkness of space and the edge of the
Milky Way. In the diagram, I have expanded
the width of the ecliptic to 14°, the actual
width of the band through which the sun,
moon, and planets travel, and the dark-rift
is at least 6° wide. The crossroads is thus
less a point in space and more a zone. Be¬
cause of the diffuse nature of the Milky
Diagram 50. Parameters of the dark-rift’s

night, August 5, 1996



THE LONG COUNT: GALACTIC ALIGNMENT IN 20M / 111
Way near the southern terminus of the dark-rift (just north of the precise crossing
point), we are technically correct in saying that the dark-rift touches the ecliptic.
In all fairness, the sense one gets from seeing it is that the roundish, darkest area
of the dark-rift is clearly north of the ecliptic.4 One should consider, however,
that in the mythic consciousness of the ancient skywatchers, astronomical preci¬
sion was less important than the mythological and calendric meaning ascribed to
this area.5
In general then, the dark-rift is suitably close to the crossroads, the cosmic
Place of Creation. The idea then is that the sun, in one of its quarter stations, could
"enter the road" and travel into the Otherworld—the cosmic Creation Place. This
alignment is, of course, time dependent because it is a function of precession. All
this evidence leads to one conclusion: For the Maya, 13.0.0.0.0 (a.d. 2012) repre¬
sented the era in which the doorway into the Heart of Creation opens.
DECEMBER SOLSTICE SUN: THE SLOW APPROACH
How can we best visualize precession and its effects on the position of the sun
in the sky? This can be illustrated very simply:
In the diagram, position A indicates the position of the December solstice sun
5,000 years ago. It is some 70° from the dark-rift crossing point in Sagittarius.
Position B indicates the De¬
cember solstice sun 2,000
years ago. Notice that the
phenomenon of precession is
causing the position of the
December solstice sun to
converge with the Creation
Place. This diagram is a clear
illustration of the way we can
track precession by watching
the movement of a fore¬
ground feature (the Decem¬
ber solstice ecliptic "sta¬
tion") in relation to the back¬
ground feature of the Milky
Diagram 51. Convergence of the December solstice sun with
the Creation Place over a period of 5,000 years



112 / MAYA COSMOCENESIS 2 012
Way. Position C shows the culmination of the process in a.d. 2012, when the De¬
cember solstice sun will be in conjunction with the Galactic Center.
The Creation Place we have been discussing is not just a fanciful fairy tale of
the Maya. It is an actual location in the sky, a place that indeed can be called a
cosmic womb or Creation Place,- it is the Galactic Center. I have argued that this
area of the Milky Way could have been recognized as a womb or Creation Place
simply by naked-eye observation, because the "central bulge" in the area of the
Galactic Center suggests this identification. Let me clarify that the term Galactic
Center refers to the center of our Milky Way Galaxy, not the center of all galaxies.
Astronomers and Maya scholars may be very skeptical that ancient Mesoamerican
skywatchers could have been aware of the Galactic Center. In this book, I propose
two possibilities. The first involves the scenario just described, that the observable
central bulge imagistically suggests the womb of a huge pregnant being. Thus, the
same part of the sky that modern science calls Galactic Center was understood by
the Maya for what it truly is—a Creation Place and cosmic center. The other possi¬
bility is more challenging.
From studies in iconography and ethnobotany, we know the ancient Maya radi¬
cally altered their perceptions in order to have visions of the underlying nature of
reality. They achieved this heightened awareness through the use of hallucinogens
collected from sacred plants or the Bufo marines toad. Some powerful hallucino¬
gens, particularly psilocybin mushrooms and Dimethyltriptamine (DMT and its
derivative 5-MEODMT), can enhance one's visual acuity, giving one brief access to
subtle energy fields not normally visible to the eye. If the Maya cosmonauts gazed
into the night sky while in such a state, and evidence I will present later suggests
they did, the Galactic Center might have become overwhelmingly obvious, a blaz¬
ing energy-knot in the night sky.
A constantly recurring mythological motif in Mesoamerican ideas is that of the
Night Sun. In Central Mexican picture books the Night Sun is depicted as a spiderlike
being—a black sun with dark rays shooting out in all directions. Scholars have tradi¬
tionally identified this motif as the sun during its nightly journey underground, that
is, through the Underworld. However, as we have seen, the Maya thought of the
night sky as the Underworld, and thus the Night Sun would not be the sun under
the earth, but a "dark sun" in the highest point of the night sky. As such, the Night
Sun may indeed refer to the Galactic Center. Of course, the Galactic Center does
not resemble a blazing sun—at least, not in normal states of consciousness.



THE LONG COUNT: GALACTIC ALIGNMENT IN 2012 / 113
It is a fact of astronomy that the December solstice sun will be in conjunction
with the great bulge of the Galactic Center in the years around a.d. 2012. Astro¬
physicists now believe that a Black Hole—a hyperdense object from which even
light cannot escape—exists at the center of our Galaxy. Amazingly, evidence that
the Maya were aware of the Black Hole in the Galactic Center is found in hiero¬
glyphic texts describing the creation of the world, and this evidence will be ex¬
plored in more depth in Chapter 16 and Appendix 4.
THE GALACTIC EQUATOR PASSOVER
Precision-oriented thinkers may notice by looking closely at the diagrams in
this chapter that the December solstice sun will make its closest pass to the Ga¬
lactic Center sometime during the next two hundred years. Because the precise
location of the Galactic Center is slightly south of the ecliptic, and the ecliptic
crosses over the Milky Way at a 60° angle, the December solstice sun will be slightly
closer to the Galactic Center in about two hundred years. However, the spatial
difference between the solstice sun and the Galactic Center in 2012 versus the
twenty-third century is negligible, and other considerations, which I will discuss
below, indicate era 2012 as the true alignment era. A close view of the sun's move¬
ment through the region of the great bulge of the Galactic Center reveals the spa¬
tial and temporal parameters of
the Galactic Alignment. Diagram 52. Close view of the 2012 alignment
In a.d. 2012 the sun will
be some 3° from the Galactic
Center (and 3° is considered to
be within conjunction). We can
calculate that its closest pass,
in about two hundred years,
will be 2°45’. In the most gen¬
eralized scenario, the spatial
parameters of this solstice sun
Galaxy alignment can be ex¬
panded to include the moment
the solstice sun first began to
conjunct the eastern edge of the



114/ MAYA CO SMOG E N E S I S 2012
Milky Way, which was something like 450 years ago. The temporal range of the
alignment, depending on how we define conjunction, can therefore be on the order
of 900 years. On the other hand, our search for an exact date of conjunction is
hampered by the fact that there are several astronomical factors involved. The prob¬
lem with looking too closely for a precise solstice sun-Galactic Center alignment is
that the Galactic Center is not a point in the sky but a region, and it has identifiable
gravitational and magnetic centers that do not share the same location. Thus, for
very real empirical reasons, it is misleading to envision the Galactic Center as a
precise point in the sky; it is more realistic to see it as the large field covered by the
visible great bulge. Overall, that the Galactic Center, the Galactic equator's cross¬
ing point with the ecliptic, and the December solstice sun's position in a.d. 2012
are all located within 3° of each other, provides a relatively small zone, or window,
in which the alignment phenomenon occurs.
More importantly, astronomical considerations allow us to suspect that the
real trigger of the World Age shift occurs when the solstice meridian crosses over
the Galactic equator, which is complete by the end of 1999.6 However, since the
sun is one-half of a degree wide, that final half-diameter of the sun (one-fourth of a
degree) will not be clear of the Galactic equator until a.d. 2018. Again, calculating
precise alignments between abstract meridians and points disregards the fact that
actual astronomical features, with size and shape, are involved. We can certainly
debate the fine points regarding the exact year of the World Age shift, but, as men¬
tioned, this approach stems from too great a need for precision, and we can get lost
in micro-scrutinizing the data. I believe and emphasize that the era of transforma¬
tion is defined by the December solstice sun's alignment with the equatorial band
extending out from the Galactic Center, which is some 3° away. I will discuss the
social and evolutionary implications that this passage through the Galactic equa¬
tor will have for life on Earth in greater detail in Part V.
Maya Creation cosmology involves the precession of the equinoxes and the
astronomical features discussed in this section. Now that we have explored how
precession works and the parameters of the astronomical factors near the Creation
Place, it is about time we put the pieces of the puzzle together.



CHAPTER 10
MAYA CREATION:
THE STELLAR FRAME AND WORLD ACES
H
aving examined and clarified the astronomical factors of the 2012 alignment,
we can now look more closely at how this event was incorporated into Maya
cosmology. How did the ancient skywatchers observe the slow convergence of the
sun and the Milky Way, over 2,000 years ago? How were those astronomical players
depicted in Maya myth? What did the alignment look like to them? And why did
they conceive of this as a future rebirth of the world? What are the late-breaking
ideas about Maya Creation mythology emerging in academic circles?
The sky defined the Maya understanding of cosmogenesis. Celestial events
were mythologized into stories for the masses that nevertheless had deeper esoteric
underpinnings. For example, the resurrection of the Popol Vuh deity One Hunahpu
(First Father) as the Maize God was an annual event, commemorated with each
year's corn harvest. Yet First Father's resurrection also had a celestial component of
much larger scope, a rebirth of the world on a scale of epic proportions. My research
emphasizes the importance of the larger perspective, one necessary in consider¬
ation of the alignment pointed to by the Long Count end-date. Maya scholar Linda
Scheie recently offered a revolutionary mytho-astronomical interpretation of the
celestial origins of Maya Creation myth,1 although the full story is still emerging.
In the book Maya Cosmos, Scheie recounts the process by which she came to her
important discoveries. She drew from the body of ethnographic evidence that shows
that mythological beings have astronomical identities. For example, the vain and
115



116/ MAYA C0SM06 E N E 5 I S 2012
false ruler Seven Macaw corresponds to the Big Dipper and his wife, Chimalmat,
corresponds to the Little Dipper, which contains the Pole Star. As such, they are
regents of the polar area. In the Maya Hero Twin myth (the Popol Vuh), the Hero
Twins are destined to destroy Seven Macaw. In doing so, they make way for the
resurrection of their father, One Hunahpu, otherwise known as First Father. This
long-anticipated rebirth ushers in a new World Age, one of many described in the
Maya Creation myth.
Linda Scheie identified the birth of First Father/One Hunahpu on Classic-period
ceramics, where he is depicted emerging from the cracked back of a turtle—a sym¬
bol of the Earth. According to star-glyphs found in Maya codices, the turtle also is
found in the sky, the three stars of Orion's belt forming its back. Alnitak, the south¬
ernmost star in Orion's belt, combines with the two leg stars to make a cosmic
triangle. Scheie pointed out that the Maya call this triangle the hearth, and identify
it with the three stones used in their hearths. They are thought of as the three stones
of Creation, and the embers of the primal fire are seen to be the Orion nebula, lo¬
cated in the center of the triangle of hearthstones.2 First Father's emergence from the
nearby belt stars is connected to the lighting of the primal fire and the dawn of time.
First Father is thus likened to the Aztec deity Xiuhtecuhtli, who, as we saw earlier is
the Fire God that Maya scholar David Kelley identified with the Orion constella¬
tion. But First Father is
also the Maize God, so the
celestial movement of the
sun past the Orion
Gemini constellations, in
June, evokes the annual
rebirth of life-giving
maize during the growing
season. In other words,
when the solar fire passes
through the hearth (the
triangle formed from stars
in Orion), life returns to
Earth in the form of ger¬
minating maize. Scheie's
interpretation revolves
Diagram 53. Orion, the Turtle, Hearthstones, Sacred Tree, Milky Way, and the Maize God



MAYA CREATION: THE STELLAR FRAME AND WORLD ACES / 117
around a cosmic Navel of Creation, the place in Gemini where the Milky Way crosses
the ecliptic. Probably the most exciting identification explained by Scheie involves
this cosmic crossroads. She points out that the ecliptic corresponds to the many
double-headed serpent bars found in Maya art, and the Milky Way is the cosmic
axis, the “trunk" of the World Tree. Thus, the crossing point of the Milky Way and
the ecliptic is the Maya Sacred Tree, the Place of Creation and rebirth.
In general terms then, Maya myth and astronomy complement each other,
and, according to Scheie, Creation revolves around the cosmic crossroads, the Sa¬
cred Tree—the crossing point of the Milky Way and the ecliptic. This in itself is a
major breakthrough in understanding the profound sources of Maya cosmology.
However, additional considerations not recognized until now paint an even more
astounding picture.
THE OTHER CREATION PLACE
Scheie focused her reconstruction of Maya Creation mythology on the cross¬
ing point of the Milky Way and the ecliptic in Gemini. This is a valid celestial
origin point for the mapping out of the quadrated celestial divisions of the sky. As
such, four roads should emanate from this spot. According to Maya cosmology,
there is a Black Road in the sky, and a White one also, but they are not found at the
crossing point in Gemini. They are found at the crossing point of the Milky Way
and the ecliptic in Sagittarius. It is true: There are two crossroads. It just so happens
that the crossroads in Sagittarius also is the location of the Black Road, known to
the Quiche Maya as the xibalba be, the Road to the Underworld. This is the dark-rift
in the Milky Way, extending north from the ecliptic as previously discussed. The
part of the Milky Way stretching south of the ecliptic is called the sac be, the White
Road. The Green and Red roads extend east and west along the ecliptic, with the
Milky Way dividing them.3 These are the four roads and the four directions of Maya
cosmovision. In the Hero Twin Creation myth, the First God maps out the cosmos
by stretching the cord, marking the corners, designing the four-fold siding and the
four-fold cornering. The quadrated cosmos thus emerges from the navel-crossroads,
the Place of Creation. With these initial identifications, we are fully justified in
examining the Sagittarian cross as another likely place of Maya Creation. The re¬
gion of Sagittarius is particularly compelling as a Place of Creation because that is
where the Galactic Center is located.



118 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
As previously discussed, the xibalba be occurs in the Hero Twin myth in at
least three contexts. The Black Road and the "four-junction roads" are first en¬
countered when One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu journey to battle the Lords of
Xibalba. They come to a crossroads and must decide which road to take. They
choose the Black Road, which, of course, is the xibalba be. It was an appropriate
choice, since it is the road that leads to Xibalba, the Underworld. In the Under¬
world, they encounter the Dark Lords, face trickery and trials, and ultimately are
defeated and killed. The Dark Lords of Xibalba then hang One Hunahpu's decapi¬
tated head, now resembling a gourdlike skull, in a calabash tree. The skull rests in
a crook or crevice in the branches of the Cosmic Tree, which stands "by the road."
According to Popol Vuh translator Dennis Tedlock, this road is the ecliptic. Here is
the second appearance of the xibalba be, in new mythic garb: The Milky Way is the
World Tree, so this crevice in the tree is another metaphor for the dark-rift. The
crossing point of Milky Way and ecliptic was, after all, identified by Scheie as the
Sacred Tree, and the tree near the ecliptic is the Milky Way.4
The third role of the xibalba be Creation Place occurs in the next scene. A
woman named Blood Moon comes along, the skull spits in her hand and magically
conceives the Hero Twins, metaphorically associating the xibalba be with sexual
conception and the vagina of a cosmic Great Mother deity. Ultimately, the Twins
avenge their father's death, paving the way for his rebirth, which is nothing less
than the long-awaited dawning event of Maya Creation myth. Given the symbolic
identification of the dark-rift as a cosmic birthplace, we are probably safe in deduc¬
ing that One Hunahpu will be reborn from the xibalba be as well. Linda Scheie
deciphered First Father/One Hunahpu's birth as emerging from the back of an Earth
turtle,- however, these are Classic-period depictions. If we look at the early por¬
trayals of One Hunahpu's resurrection, on the monuments of Izapa, he is shown
emerging from the mouth of a jaguar-toad or other Earth deity. The mouth of the
jaguar has been considered since ancient times to symbolize the entrance to the
Underworld, as were terrestrial caves, and thus clearly refers to the dark-rift in the
Milky Way. The toad motif goes back to the Olmec, and is related to concepts of
the Cosmic Mother or Earth Goddess. The cleft head that is so prevalent in Olmec
art is a portrayal of the triangular cleft in the head of the Bufo marines toad spe¬
cies,5 which in turn signified the cave or "cleft" of Creation—the crater at the top
of the cosmic volcano that is occupied by the ancient Fire God. Coatlicue, the
name of the Aztec Mother Goddess, means Snake Woman, and the Milky Way was



MAYA CREATION: THE STELLAR FRAME AND WORLD ACES / 119
envisioned as a cosmic snake. Furthermore, the related goddess Citlalinicue was
the Great Mother of the Stars who lives in the Milky Way.6 Thus, the Milky Way
was conceived as a Great Mother Goddess in many Mesoamerican myths. In a
Creation scene from the Mixtec Codex Vindobonensis, First Father does not emerge
from a turtle, he emerges from a tree,
which, upon closer inspection, is the in¬
verted Goddess. As such, he emerges from
the Goddess's birth canal. In these mythic
transformations, the dark-rift in the Milky
Way symbolizes the cosmic birth canal.
I believe that Scheie's Gemini/Orion
centered model of Maya Creation refers to
the annual rebirth of the life-giving Corn
God, which is played out in the sky on cer¬
tain nights of the year. Remembering that
the ancient Mesoamericans considered
maize to be the source and origin of life,
we can understand this annual resurrection
of life as a celestial Mystery Play related to
the June-August-September growing sea¬
son of life-giving maize. However, Maya
cosmogenesis is also about epic spans of
time and World Age transformations, so we may suspect that Scheie's reconstruc¬
tion is incomplete. After all, she focused on only one of the crossing-point Places of
Creation—the one near Gemini. When we examine the astronomy and mythology
of the Sagittarian crossing point, we encounter more complex considerations, ones
that nevertheless speak to the vast nature of World Age rebirth described in the
Popol Vuh. While the annual resurrection of One Hunahpu as the Maize Deity is an
important seasonal application of the resurrection myth, we find that it has a more
startling, World Age component as well. In that the two readings related here (Scheie's
and my own) refer to two different temporal levels—a year and a "great year"—it
seems appropriate that one myth was located at one crossing point, while the other
was located at the opposite one.7

120/ MAYA CO SMOG E N E S I S 2012 - ^
UNION OF FIRST FATHER AND FIRST MOTHER
In the Hero Twin myth, the rebirth of First Father/One Hunahpu signifies the
dawning or creation of a new World Age. His calendric name is 1 Ahau, Ahau being
the twentieth day-sign of the 260-day tzolkin calendar. In its oldest connotation,
this day-sign means Lord or Sun. Thus, One Hunahpu is First Sun. The First Sun of
the year is the December solstice sun.8 The December solstice is the time when the
sun begins its own resurrection, making the identification between One Hunahpu
and the December solstice sun not only appropriate but clear. We must keep this
identification in mind as we examine the following mytho-astronomical motifs. We
have seen how the xibalba be has several mythic forms and how it appears in the
Popol Vuh in three contexts. It is the road that One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu
choose to take to the Underworld, and it leads
to their deaths. It is the crook in the calabash
tree where One Hunahpu's head is hung. It is
the place where the Hero Twins are conceived.
It is a road, it is the crevice in a tree, it is the
cosmic birth canal. It appears self-evident that
One Hunahpu will be reborn from this place as
well. In related contexts, we have seen how the
image of the Cosmic Mother's birth canal maps
onto the astronomical image of the dark-rift in the Milky Way. Water is life-giving,
the activator of fertility, and we have seen how the Milky Way, in addition to its
other identities, was conceived of as a river. In another image from Codex
Vindobonensis, a deity emerges from a cleft in a river that contains a four-junction
crossroads. In the illustration above, notice the footprints in the quadrated circle,
indicating the four cosmic roads.
In this image, again we see the crossroads near the cosmic birth portal. All of
these mythic images attest that the dark-rift in the Milky Way was imaged in many
ways and appears in many different forms of Mesoamerican myth. But they all
indicate that the dark-rift was conceived of as a place of magical conception and
celestial rebirth. The parallel image of birthplace and crossroads relates to the old¬
est universal ideas about celestial rebirth, the laying out of the four directions, and
World Age Creation. The crossroads and the birth portal: the cross and the cup.
These two powerful metaphors work together and provide a compellingly clear
map to the true astronomical place of Maya Creation.

MAYA CREATION: THE STELLAR FRAME AND WORLD AGES / 121
If we now look again at the astronomy of the end-date in 2012, the pieces of the
puzzle begin to fall into place. On 13.0.0.0.0, December 21, 2012, the December
solstice sun is dead center in the xibalba be, right at the crossing point of Creation
in Sagittarius. The December solstice sun is First Father and the Milky Way is
Cosmic Mother. Mythologi¬
cally speaking, on this date
First Father and Cosmic
Mother are joined. Actually, it
might be more accurate to say
that Cosmic Mother rebirths
Cosmic Father, our star, the
sun. Here we see a reflection
of a very ancient cosmogonic
Creation myth, attributable to
a substratum of history prior
to patriarchal overlay: The
Cosmic Mother is the head
point of a trinity involving the
birth of a male deity who is
also her mate. This Trinity
Principle involves the dy¬
namic between mother, father, and child, and shares with many Old World tradi¬
tions the idea that the Great Mother, as the first principle of Creation, must give
birth to her mate, First Father, and only then can engender the multiplicity of cre¬
ated beings. On the cosmic level, the astronomical trinity is Galactic Center, sol¬
stice sun, and humanity.
It is initially strange to think that Maya Creation occurs on what we are call¬
ing the "end-date/' But Maya concepts of weaving, birthing, and dawning declare
that Creation (birth) occurs at the end of a time cycle. The birth of a child occurs at
the end of the nine-month period of human gestation. Furthermore, the Maya uti¬
lized "end naming," such that periods of time were named after their last day. For
example, we are presently in the 4 Ahau katun of the Great Cycle, because it ends
on the tzolkin day 4 Ahau. On Creation Day, the New Sun emerges from the Cave
of Creation. The astronomical event of the 13-baktun cycle end-date is perfectly
evocative of World Age transformation and cosmological re-creation.

Way dark-rift



m / MAYA COSMOGENESIS lOM
The alignment of the December solstice sun with the dark-rift in Sagittarius
is caused by the precession of the equinoxes, a cycle of almost 26,000 years. It is
probably no coincidence that the 13-baktun period is exactly one-fifth of this pre
cessional cycle. The ancient Mesoamerican skywatchers clearly anticipated and
calibrated the future celestial juncture—an epic, cosmic collusion of male and
female Creation forces. This new cosmological knowledge was encoded into the
Hero Twin myth as the story of Creation. It is an essential key to understanding
my reconstruction of the Galactic Cosmology formulated by Mesoamerican sky
watchers.
THE MONUMENTS OF IZAPA
Some straightforward questions arise in considering the implications of this
discovery. For example, when and where was the Long Count invented, and who
devised it? And, if the Hero Twin Creation myth is a type of esoteric doctrine that,
in its deepest meaning, describes the nature of the Long Count end-date, when and
where was it developed? Amazingly, it turns out that the answers to these ques¬
tions are the same. Both the Long Count and the Popol Vuh emerged at the same
time, in the same region, in the same cultural context. The answer points us to the
pre-Maya Izapan civilization of southern Mesoamerica.9
Izapa was a ceremonial site in southern Chiapas that flourished some 2,100
years ago. It was the transition culture between the older Olmec and the emerging
Maya. Michael Coe and other scholars credit the Izapan civilization with devising
the Long Count. Many of Izapa's carved monuments depict distinct episodes from
the Popol Vuh, the earliest examples in the archaeological record. Nearby sites
such as Abaj Takalik yield Izapan-style art and the first Long Count dates. In exam¬
ining the monuments of Izapa, we find iconographic evidence that supports my
end-date thesis. On over fifty carved monuments found at this pre-Classic site,
there is a preoccupation with the demise of Seven Macaw at the hands of the Hero
Twins and the resurrection of First Father.
Scholars identify the crocodile-tree depicted on several Izapan stelae as the
Milky Way.10 The mouth of the crocodile monster is the dark-rift. Several monu¬
ments at Izapa and related sites depict the emergence of First Father from the mouth
of an Earth deity with treelike and reptilian features, as in the jaguar-frog/Milky
Way/Mother Goddess complex of mythic forms.



MAYA CREATION: THE STELLAR FRAME AND WORLD ACES / 123
One of the most compelling depictions from Izapa is Stela
11, which clearly portrays the astronomical meaning of the
Long Count end-date:
Here we have First Father performing the primal measur¬
ing act. The durability of this Mesoamerican deity is evident
when we realize that the later 1 Ahau of the Maya Venus
Calendar is derived from our "Hunahpu." The small circular
symbol on First Father's nose is a "star" symbol. The four
sky-streaks emanating from behind First Father, though not
in a crossroads format, may be the Four Roads. He is emerg¬
ing from the "mouth" of the jaguar-toad, who represents the
cosmic Milky Way Goddess. This monument is one of many
at Izapa that portray the alignment of the end-date. In fact, as
will be shown in more detail in Part IV, Izapa was the home
of the Initiation Mysteries into Galactic Cosmology, where
astronomer-priests utilized Izapa's many carved monuments
initiates.
THE ANCIENT SKYWATCH ERS'VIEW OF CREATION
What were the ancient skywatchers of Izapa actually looking at? And how
does Stela 11 portray the future alignment? It is extremely interesting that Stela 11
faces the rising position of the December sol¬
stice sun, where the following skyviews were
visible over a seven-hundred-year period.
In this diagram, we can see how the
Milky Way and its dark-rift looked to Meso¬
american skywatchers on the December sol¬
stice of 700 b.c. I chose this date because this
is when the pre-Maya site of Izapa was on
the rise.
By 200 b.c., again on the December sol

stice, the dark-rift "Creation Place" was no¬
ticeably closer to the horizon.
The difference in the dark-rift's position
is some 7°—a very noticeable change. By the
first century b.c., Long Count dates start ap¬
pearing in the archaeological record. If Meso
american skywatchers continued to chart the
convergence of the solstice sunrise with the
Milky Way as it appeared on the December
solstice, they would find an impasse around
the year a.d. 650. Around this era, they would
find that the rising Milky Way was too close
to the horizon to be seen as the rays of the
December solstice sun began to brighten the
sky.11 In other words, morning came on before the Milky Way was high enough
over the horizon to be seen. However, the phenomenon could still be tracked by
watching the skies days or weeks before the solstice, as well as by other, more
complicated means. The point is that the phenomenon—precession—was tracked
and calculated long before this impasse occurred. The date of the future "Zero Time"
of Galactic Alignment was calculated by at least
37 b.c., when the Long Count first appears in the
archaeological record. By that time, the follow¬
ing skyview was seen from Izapa on the Decem¬
ber solstice:
Here we have the Cosmic Milky Way Mon¬
ster with her dark-rift "mouth" some 30° above
the dawning Depember solstice sun. Throughout
the process, the precession of the stellar frame has
been causing the December solstice sun to slowly
converge with the "mouth." Izapan skywatchers
of the formative period (400 b.c. to 100 b.c.) cer¬
tainly could have noticed the process. They would
have realized that when the alignment occurs, at
dawn on Creation Day, the Milky Way rims the
horizon. The sky will then sit upon the Earth,

touching it at all points around the horizon. This alignment of solar and Galactic
planes may define a subtle Earth-rhythm, empirically measurable, propelling trans¬
formations of life on Earth at distinct intervals, an arcane artifact of ancient cosmol¬
ogy that points to our immediate future. The precession-defined alignment high¬
lighted by the Maya end-date occurs only once every 26,000 years. We are living in
the shadows of a rare celestial juncture.
THE MAYA END TIMES
The full meaning of the celestial origins of Maya Creation should now be clear.
In addition to Linda Scheie's interpretation of Maya Creation revolving around the
crossing point in Gemini, there is a more far-reaching esoteric component that
becomes apparent when we examine the crossing point in Sagittarius. During the
archaic transition from Olmec to Maya culture, we may imagine that a new discov¬
ery defined the emerging Maya as unique bearers of a more sophisticated cosmo¬
logical understanding, and heirs to a new era. They were, with great ingenuity, very
far-seeing and pointedly focused on a vision of future rebirth. Anchored as this
belief is to an actual stellar process, we cannot say that it is not going to happen.
Our own millennial milestone is strangely mocked and modified by ancient Maya
cosmology. For the ancient Izapans and the early Maya, and in the earliest version
of the Long Count-Popol Vuh Creation myth, Creation occurs on 13.0.0.0.0, De¬
cember 21, 2012, when First Father and First Mother join forces to engender a new
World Age.
The Hero Twin story is one "myth" that encodes the astronomy of the Long
Count end-date. Earlier, we saw how the New Fire ceremony was the "myth" that
explained the Zenith Cosmology. There is another Mesoamerican tradition that
encodes the alignment in 2012, one that involves heroic triumph and Mystery Play,
as well as human sacrifice. Like the Hero Twin and New Fire myths, this esoteric
tradition, with precessional knowledge at its center, was not a marginal aspect of
Mesoamerican society. It had everything to do with the renewal of the sun, the
rebirth of First Father, and the triumph of light over darkness. It is the Mesoamerican
ballgame.

THE COSMIC SYMBOLISM OF THE
MAYA BALLCAME
New World
throughout
though the
rules of the game varied widely from region to region. The Maya developed the
ballgame into a ritual Mystery Play filled with symbolism, which we can under¬
stand by studying its depiction in Maya books and on painted ceramics, murals,
and sculpture. In addition, the ballgame's primary symbols and procedures are present
in mythological sources such as the Popol Vuh. There is a mythological dimension
to the game, and because the characters of Maya myth have astronomical identi¬
ties, the ballgame ultimately describes specific celestial processes and events. Over¬
all, scholars have come to a general understanding of the profound symbolism en¬
coded into the Mesoamerican ballgame. We can apply these accepted academic ideas
to the cosmic level of meaning, thus supplying a deeper reading that is overlooked
in the mainstream interpretation. By "cosmic level of meaning" I mean the
ballgame's clear reference to World Age rebirth and cosmogenesis.
One scholar who studied the ballgame in detail sums up its meaning this way:
". . . the human ballgame was considered a repetition of a divine one, constituting
a kind of magic by analogy, to support the victory of the light against the darkness,
the sun against the stars."1 Thus, in the broadest terms, the ballgame is about the
battle between the forces of darkness and light. Victory occurs when the ball passes
through the goalring, symbolizing the triumphant rebirth of the sun. As scholars
have noted, the ballgame evokes the sun's daily rebirth (at dawn) as well as its
A
ballgame similar to the one played by the Maya has existed in the
for thousands of years. Remains of ballcourts have been found
Mesoamerica and beyond, from Arizona to the isles of the Caribbean,

yearly rebirth. The time of the yearly rebirth is a matter of academic debate, usu¬
ally being placed either on the December solstice or the March equinox. For rea¬
sons that will become clear, I believe the December solstice is the correct interpre¬
tation for the date of annual solar rebirth. Of course, this date is in agreement with
some of the most commonly held ideas around the globe, for Western culture as a
whole celebrates the New Year around the December solstice. As for the Maya, the
end of the 13-baktun cycle of the Long Count calendar falls on the December sol¬
stice, thus suggesting that this point in the solar year was considered a major
end-beginning nexus.
According to scholarly interpretation of the ballgame's symbolism, solar re¬
birth occurs on two temporal levels: daily and annually. Unfortunately, scholars
have neglected the next higher level, that of World Age rebirth—solar rebirth in
terms of the large-scale "Great Year" of the Long Count. This oversight is surpris¬
ing, because world renewal is a major aspect of Maya Creation myth. I refer to this
next level as the cosmic or galactic level, because it ultimately involves the galac¬
tic frame of time and the Galactic Alignment that occurs on the 13-baktun cycle
end-date. As argued throughout the book, this end-date represents when the Maya
believed the next World Age would begin, that is, when the current era or "Sun"
would be reborn on the galactic level of time. As we will see, the astronomical and
mythological features associated with the end-date (December 21, 2012 a.d.) apply
directly to the symbolism of the ballgame. The three temporal levels of solar re¬
birth in the Maya ballgame, then, are as follows: daily rebirth, annual rebirth, and
World Age rebirth.
FEATURES OF THE GAME
With these three temporal levels in mind, we can
now take a detailed look at the features of the Maya
ballgame. The game included the following elements:
the ballcourt, the players, the gameball, the goalring,
the center marker, and the gaming gear or equipment.
Symbolically, the ballcourt itself represents either an
entrance to the Underworld or the Underworld itself,
because ballcourts are literally "earth depressions,"
recalling other Underworld portals such as cenotes
Diagram 61. Serpent-mouth
stairway from Bilbao



THE COSMIC SYMBOLISM OF THE MAYA BALLCAME / 129
and caves. As diagram 61 reveals, stairways leading down into the ballcourt at sites
such as Bilbao actually resemble serpent mouths.
We can see that each step has two serpent "fangs," likening the stairway pas¬
sage to a serpent's mouth.2 Like a jaguar's or a toad's, the serpent's mouth symbol¬
izes the entrance to the Underworld. Images of Classic-period ballcourts show ritual
activities occurring near the stepped-wall architecture of ballcourts. In these scenes
the ball is often portrayed as the decapitated head or skull of a sacrificed deity, and
in Maya myth, the ball-skull is the head of First Father/One Hunahpu, who in the
Popol Vuh was killed and decapitated by the Lords of
the Underworld.
As a symbol of the solar deity One Hunahpu,
the ball-skull is the sun, a meaning almost univer¬
sally accepted among scholars. Thus, the movements
of the ball during the game reflect the movements
of the sun. As mentioned earlier, in ballgame sym¬
bolism the sun moves along and is reborn on three
temporal levels, with each level building upon the
"dawn point" of the previous level. For example, the sun's daily rebirth occurs at
dawn, when the sun moves from the Underworld below the eastern horizon into
the day sky. Its annual rebirth begins at dawn on the December solstice, when the
sun begins to move from the deepest Underworld level of winter (the longest night
of the year) into increasing daylight. Finally,
its World Age rebirth begins at dawn on the
December solstice of the year a.d. 2012, the
Zero Point of the Galactic cycle.3 At this
highest level, the ballgame is a metaphor for
precessional movement of the December sol¬
stice sun.
Another important aspect of ballcourt
symbolism relates to the ballcourt's cross¬
shaped depiction in Central Mexican picture
books.

130 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
The cross is a universal Mesoamerican symbol of the Creation Place.
Classic-period ballcourts, being layed out in such a pattern, "essentially represented
the surface of the earth, the four cardinal directions, and the symbolic entrance to
the Underworld within its center."4 In the Popol Vuh, the western ballcourt where
the Hero Twins battle the Lords of Xibalba is actually in the Underworld. Crosses
still used by the Tzotzil Maya in highland Chiapas represent doorways to the
Otherworld. Skulls are often shown in the very center of ballcourts, and skulls
represent the Underworld.
Quatrefoil shapes, such as those carved on ballcourt
markers at Copan, enclose events taking place in the Un¬
derworld. These are less rigid than the I-shaped symbols of
the ballcourt depictions from Central Mexico.
Ballcourts symbolically represent the intersection of
the Upper and Lower worlds, and thus
their crossroads format suggests the as¬
tronomical location of the crossing point
of the Milky Way and the ecliptic. Side
Diagram 64. Quatrefoil views of ballcourts also reveal a T-shape
scene in the Underworld or a stepped design, like this one from
the Dresden Codex.
In diagram 65, we see a god enthroned on the T-shaped
ballcourt. This is not surprising, since thrones also were quadrated
symbols of the cosmic center, upon which gods and kings were
enthroned. Other associations paint an even stranger scenario. The
stepped design is symbolic of a depression or cave and therefore
relates to the concept of the Earth-womb, the birthing house of
the Goddess. As we have already seen, the Maya associated caves
with the concepts of the womb and the vaginal passageway.5 In the Tzotzil lan¬
guage, the word ch’en (cave) also means a woman's vagina.6 The ballcourt, the cave,
the goalring, the birth canal: these associations are rich and profound, and provide
clues to help reconstruct the cosmic meaning of the Maya ballgame.7
There are also rich associations to explore with the stepped-wall symbol of the
ballcourt. The stepped-wall design that indicates the Underworld portal to the
Xibalban ballcourt is related to the "step-curl" motif that appears on the forehead
of Classic-period Cauac monsters (see diagram 66).

The cleft-forehead design is derived from the Olmec
cleft-head motif, and it ultimately refers to the "broken place,
the bitter water place" where the Maize God (also known as
First Father) is reborn. The step-curl of the Cauac monster is
often portrayed as an
emergence place, once
again suggesting the
womb environment.8

the same structural pat¬
tern: A round object or a deity is shown in¬
side the cleft "Creation Place" at the top (see
diagram 68). The basic structure of these
varied cosmic monster symbols can be boiled down to a symbol that
is none other than the glyph for
ballcourts. This image portrays the
game-ball in the goalring. However,
it also looks like a cornseed in a pod.
Since this "pod" or earth-cleft also
is an entrance to the Underworld, the
astronomical reference would appear to be to the
xibalba be, the entrance to the Underworld iden¬
tified with the dark-rift in the Milky Way.

to the Olmec motif of the cleft head, and represent the birthplace of maize and the
Maize Deity. Importantly, the ballgame victory was as much about the Maize Deity's
rebirth as it was about the sun's rebirth; both represent life and light.9 The astro¬
nomical features of the Maya ballgame are now becoming clear. The cleft and
"cross" references in the diagrams above are to the dark-rift in the Milky Way and
the Milky Way/ecliptic cross. As we will see, the primary ballgame symbol for the
dark-rift is the goalring, and the December solstice sun (the gameball) must pass
through the goalring to be reborn.
COSMIC SHADOWS AND ALIGNMENTS AT CHICHEN ITZA
The ballgame and ballcourt symbolism were highly developed at the site of
Chichen Itza in the Yucatan, which contains no less than thirteen ballcourts, in¬
cluding the largest one yet found.
The Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza, located a short distance northwest of the
Pyramid of Kukulcan, was oriented to the Milky Way on the June solstice in the
era a.d. 865.10 At midnight on every June
solstice during this era, the long axis of
the ballcourt pointed to where the
Milky Way touched the horizon. The
body of the Milky Way arched through
the sky, mirroring the ballcourt itself,
and the dark-rift in the Milky Way
would have been observed overhead. In
other words, it appears the designers of
Chichen's ballcourt intended to mirror
the dark-rift and the Milky Way with
the orientation of the ceremonial
ballcourt. This makes sense when we
remember that the night sky and the
Underworld are in essence the same.11
This is a little appreciated but very sig¬
nificant truism of Maya cosmo-conception: The Underworld was, in one sense,
located under the Earth, but at night it rotated above the horizon to become the
night sky.

In the relationship between the
Milky Way and the Great Ballcourt just
described, the dark-rift is the "central
hole" of the Milky Way ballcourt; in
other words, it is the cosmic goalring.
Its cosmological meanings include a cen¬
ter and navel of the sky, a portal to other
dimensions, and a place of rebirth. This
is where the solar deity—the big game
ball—will be reborn at the end of the
current era.
There is another interesting hiero
phany that takes place in the ballcourt on the June solstice. The ballcourt's east
wall has a scene carved on it of a ballgame. In the lengthwise center of the wall,
nearly underneath the actual goalring placed higher up on the wall, is a gameball
portrayed as a skull. Around noon on the June solstice, a shadow cast by the sun
stretches along the lower wall and, as noon approaches, it appears that the ball is
passing through the ring's shadow.12
Imagine the game played on the June solstice around a.d. 865. During midday,
while the Mystery Play unfolds on the court, the solstice Sun Deity casts a beam
through the goalring, illuminating the gameball carved on the east wall. At the
very least, this associates solar rebirth (symbolized by the ball passing through the
goalring's shadow) with the solstice. Specifically, the June solstice and on this same
day, at midnight, the dark-rift looms overhead as the Milky Way aligns with the
ballcourt. Combined, these two events, one at noon and one at midnight, proclaim
a clear message: The solstice Sun Deity goes into the dark-rift and the game is over.
The image of the solstice goalring shadow moving along the ballcourt's east wall is
similar to the equinoctial shadow-serpent that appears on the nearby Pyramid of
Kukulcan. Given the hierophanies associated with the Great Ballcourt and the Pyra¬
mid of Kukulcan, equinox dates, zenith-passage dates, and solstice dates are all
significant in the cosmologies represented at Chichen Itza.
In one meaning, the dark-rift symbolizes the goalring, but, being overhead in
the middle of the Milky Way ballcourt, it should also reflect an object located in
the exact center of the ballcourt's playing field. If you visit the ruins today, you will
not see anything there. What was there—a stone marker—was pulled out long ago

and was lost for decades, but has now been recovered. Maya
scholar Linnea Wren reconstructed the discovery and rediscov¬
ery of the Ballcourt Stone.13
Among the fascinating facts associated with this artifact is
the symbolism of its shape. It clearly shows a ball (the sun) in the
goalring (the dark-rift overhead). This resemblance provides ad¬
ditional evidence for my interpretation of the astronomical di¬
mension of the Maya ballgame.
Since the ballgame was played at Chichen Itza in the ninth century, we might
be tempted to determine on what date in the solar year the sun conjuncted the
dark-rift in that century. If we consult astronomy software, we find the rather un¬
spectacular date of December 3. But we must remember that the World Age myth
the final victory of the ballgame—involved the far future transformation or rebirth
of the solstice sun at the end of the current era, December 21, 2012. Clearly, the
Ballcourt Stone portrays the Great Cycle ending of 13.0.0.0.0, when the December
solstice Ahau successfully passes through the birth portal—the goalring—to re
emerge from the Underworld into the next world.14
The Ballcourt Stone was found in the central spot of the ballcourt. At other
sites, this spot is sometimes occupied by a simple marker. Sometimes these center
markers contain a skull design or a com¬
memoration date. The center marker from
the ballcourt at Tonina, a Classic-period
Maya site southeast of Palenque, provides
astounding confirmation of the theory we
have been discussing.
Tonina's center marker shows an
Ahau Lord holding a double-headed bar.
As explained earlier, Maya kings represent
the World Axis (the Milky Way), and the
"serpent bar" they hold in front of them
symbolizes the ecliptic. This interpreta¬
tion is especially relevant to Palenque, a site closely related to Tonina. So, this
central marker plaque at Tonina says to us: Here is the spot that marks the cross
formed by the Milky Way and the ecliptic. But what about the dark-rift "hole"
within the cross—the end-date goalring? Lifting this center marker up reveals a
Diagram 74. The center marker in the Tonina
ballcourt symbolizing the Milky Way/ecliptic
cross, and the hole underneath



THE COSMIC SYMBOLISM OF THE MAYA BALLCAME / 135
deep hole, thought by scholars to be a "sacrifice" offering pit. This "hole" clearly
represents the dark-rift within the cosmic crossroads, a significant association, but
there's more. Tonina's center marker contains the dedication date of 9.17.5.0.0,
which is December 27, 775 a.d. Dedication events usually stretched over a couple
of days, placing the beginning of this ballcourt's dedication within a day or two of
the December solstice.15 So, the cosmic symbolism of the Chichen Itza ballcourt,
clearly pointing to the end-date astronomy, is validated at Tonina. If we combine
the symbology of Tonina's center marker with the symbology of Chichen Itza's
Ballcourt Stone, and remember that the solstice sun is involved in both contexts,
the following astronomical features are implicated:
• The cross formed by the Milky Way and the ecliptic
• The dark-rift in the Milky Way
• The solstice sun in conjunction with the dark-rift in the Milky Way
Ballgame symbolism clearly refers to the alignment that occurs on the 13-baktun
cycle end-date in 2012. Despite the overwhelmingly clear picture that leads to this
conclusion, my theory about the deeper meaning of the Maya ballgame is completely
new. Scholars have narrowly skirted around putting the pieces together, but, strangely,
they avoid making the connection. For example, Linda Scheie and David Freidel
analyzed hieroglyphs associated with the ballgame and deciphered an important
glyph to mean "black hole." The Creation events played out in the ballgame "hap¬
pened at the black hole."16 These authors then proceeded to note that the "black
hole" hieroglyph refers to Maya Creation events, as well as the place where Maya
kings were enthroned, and points to "the Black Road, through the Cleft in the Milky
Way . . . from the ballcourts of the Maya to the Court of Creation in the Land of
Death."17 Incredibly, these scholars note a connection between the "black hole"
hieroglyph so central to ballgame symbolism and the dark-rift (the Black Road) in
the Milky Way! However, this important insight never surfaces again in the writ¬
ings of either Scheie or Freidel, even though their book Maya Cosmos had every¬
thing to do with Maya Creation mythology. Instead, as we saw in Chapter 10, Scheie
chose to explore the astronomical features near the crossroads in Gemini rather
than the ones near the "black hole" in Sagittarius. It seems, then, that academia is
either biding its time or has overlooked an extremely important facet of Maya cos¬
mology.18 As a result, I have done all my pioneering work on this question in the



136/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
face of almost total academic silence. The overarching importance of the Portal to
the Underworld, the dark-rift near Sagittarius, though clearly stumbled across from
time to time, has yet to be embraced in the hallowed halls of academia.
My reconstruction of the Maya ballgame addresses its highest, most esoteric
function. I focused on astronomical and cosmological concepts, as that is where I
feel its most profound and deepest meaning is to be found. In brief, the ball passing
through the goalring represents the rebirth of the sun, and the Maya perceived this
to occur on daily, annual, and galactic levels. The galactic level of solar rebirth
involves the precession-caused movement of the winter solstice sun into align¬
ment with the dark-rift (the cosmic goalring). The ballgame was a ceremonial Mys¬
tery Play, with the Galactic Cosmology as its central doctrine.
We can learn more about the inner secrets of the ballgame when we examine
the role of the gameplayers. Evidence suggests the players may have used halluci¬
nogenic mushrooms to heighten their coordination and reflexes, and to intensify
the drama of the game. Generally, the players were required to make a sacrifice, to
give their energy and even their lives so that the ball could reach its goal and the
cosmic machinery of time and fate would continue to roll forward.
KEEP IT ROLLING
Scholars are still somewhat unclear as to who the gameplayers actually were.
Were they captured slaves from other kingdoms forced to feed the gods? Were they
a special class of athletic warriors, competing for the highest honor of being sacri¬
ficed to the gods? Were they the Maya kings themselves, impersonating deities and
culture heros, as part of regularly performed pageantry and Mystery Play? Probably
all of these possibilities were true at various times. However, if we look closely at
the ballplayers' equipment, we can understand what their central role was.
Ballplayers used an array of equipment while playing. In the Popol Vuh, the
Hero Twins' ballgame gear was stashed in the rafters of their grandmother's house.
Since the upper domain of the cosmic house (i.e., grandmother's house) is the night
sky, the gaming gear may represent constellations.19 The ballplayers usually wore
stone "yokes" with which they hit the ball. Archaeologists have found a few of
these heavy U-shaped devices like that shown in diagram 75.
Notice the knot-curl on the forehead of the deity who is carved on the yoke's
side, which symbolizes a place of emergence or birth. This is no doubt a variation



THE COSMIC SYMBOLISM OF THE MAYA BALLCAME / 137
of the step-curl forehead motifs discussed ear¬
lier. Scholars recognize the U-shape as a sym¬
bol for either the moon or the entrance to the
Underworld (or both).20 Thus, when the play¬
ers wore the stone yoke around their hips, they
were symbolically halfway in the Underworld,
that is, between worlds. This means that they,
like the sun during its strenuous rebirth on
three temporal levels, were trying to emerge
into another world. In a sense, they were half¬
way through the birthing experience. They
were being born while trying to help the sun
be reborn at the same time and so were engaged
in a kind of sympathetic magic to help the sun
move toward its goal. In short, the ballplayers
were indispensible in keeping the end-date alignment moving toward its goal.
I interpret the gameplayers as heroic semi-human deities whose job was to
keep the sun rolling toward its meeting with the dark-rift. In other words, they
were in a sense like cosmic midwives, or vision-helpers, who must facilitate the
emergence of the next World Age, the rebirth of the solar deity (and all life) into the
galactic level. Through a kind of sympathetic magic, they kept the precessional
frame rolling so that the doorway through to the source and center of the cosmos
which resides at the deepest foundation of the "Underworld" (the night sky)—can
open. Through their efforts, an alignment between the foreground framework of
the sky (the local solar system defined by the ecliptic, with its four seasonal quarter
positions of the sun) and the cosmic background of the sky (the Milky Way) will
occur in 2012. During the 2012 victory-era, the flood of new information and en¬
ergy that pours forth will fuel the multiplication and regeneration of life on Earth.
Said in traditional terms, "fertility" is heightened to the point of overload, thus
stimulating transformation. The gameball in the dark-rift is a type of cosmic in¬
semination. This is the highest level of cosmic rebirth, symbolized by the Meso
american ballgame. When considering the mytho-cosmic dimensions of the ball
game, we cannot separate its simplest level of operation (the sun's daily rebirth at
dawn) from the larger scale process of World Age rebirth—the resurrection of First
Father/One Hunahpu on the galactic level of time. The ballgame is the game of
Diagram 75. Stone yoke worn by ball¬
players, symbol of the Underworld
portal



138 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2011
cocreation, a partnership between humans and higher forces in cosmogenesis. The
ballfields truly are cosmic courts of Creation, where the forces of creation are
"courted" and engaged, and where the role of human beings as cocreators in their
own evolution is activated.
ONE MORE QUESTION
One final question emerged for me as I decoded the presence of the Galactic
Cosmology at Chichen Itza. The galactic ballcourt at Chichen is, indeed, an impos¬
ing structure. However, the Pyramid of Kukulcan is even more magnificent, and
hides within it the ancient Zenith Cosmology of the Toltecs. Could both cosmologies
exist side by side at Chichen Itza? Since the Galactic Cosmology was followed by
the Maya and the Zenith Cosmology was used by the Toltecs—two widely separate
cultures—how could both co-exist at Chichen?21 We are currently in the World Age
of 4 Ollin (4 Movement or Earthquake), which emerged at Toltec Teotihuacan in
the distant past. The end of this Fifth Sun was tracked with the New Fire cer¬
emony, the Zenith Cosmology reconstructed earlier in chapters 6 and 7.22 But does
the end-date of the Aztec calendar coincide with the 2012 World Age end-date of
the Maya? Here is the pressing question: Did the Zenith Cosmology and the Galac¬
tic Cosmology ever meet? Something appeared to be going on here, and I deter¬
mined to look more closely at Chichen Itza's history.



CHAPTER 12

MAYA-TOLTEC RECONCILIATION
T
he great city of Chichen Itza, a magical center of Mesoamerican knowledge, is
where the equinox manifestation of Kukulcan, the Plumed Serpent, occurs.
This has become an annual event in which thousands of people from around the
world gather to watch the sun cast its rays across the corner of Kukulcan's pyramid,
projecting a shadow-image of a descending serpent along the balustrade of the north
stairway. Viewers come away amazed at the sophisticated architectural engineering
of the Maya, and with a feeling for their profound and little understood cosmology.
The cosmological insights of Chichen Itza go even deeper than its shadow-play.
There are other cosmic alignments at Chichen involving the Great Ballcourt, the
Upper Temple of the Jaguars, and the famous Caracol observatory. We will look
closely at these architectural cosmo-conceptions to reveal exactly what purpose
Chichen Itza served within the larger context of Mesoamerican civilization and its
evolving cosmological knowledge.
A POLAR HISTORY OF MESOAMERICA
As discussed earlier, the Olmecs were the great Mesoamerican "Mother Cul¬
ture," building an extensive civilization that existed between 2500 b.c. and 300 b.c.
Olmec sites such as La Venta, San Lorenzo, and Tres Zapotes are located in the
so-called Olmec heartland—the low, swampy, Gulf Coast areas of the modern states
of Tabasco and Veracruz. According to historians and archaeologists, the Olmec
represented a unified phase of Mesoamerican civilization that lasted from 900 b.c.
to 500 b.c.1
139



140/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
But what happened after that? It appears that a split occurred, dividing a previ¬
ously unified Mesoamerican civilization into two camps, each with different cos¬
mological doctrines. Around 100 b.c., the rise of two major cultural traditions be¬
gan, but in two widely separated regions. In Central Mexico, the Toltecs founded a
metropolis called Teotihuacan, City of the Gods, aligning it with the Pleiades and
the zenith sun. This great center of civilization grew and established many towns
under its dominion, coming to control most of the area for six centuries. Teotihuacan
is where the present, soon-to-end Fifth Sun was born, and it is believed to be the
mythical Tollan of the Aztecs. (The Aztecs arrived on the cultural scene of Central
Mexico much later, in the fourteenth century a.d.) At the same time that Toltec
tradition and cosmology were being formu¬
lated in Central Mexico, the Maya, far to
the east, emerged in the jungle-forests of
Guatemala, Belize, and Yucatan, creating
interrelated city states such as Cerros,
Caracol, Calakmul, Uaxactun, El Mirador,
and Tikal.
The Maya and the Toltec civilizations
developed at the same time and, although
they nurtured trade links through which
artistic forms and ideas were shared, they
designed two different cosmological sys¬
tems to track World Ages. The underlying
calendar used by both groups was the
260-day calendar, but a basic disagreement in how large-scale cycles of time were to
be tracked—the timing of World Ages—apparently drove a wedge between the Toltecs
and the Mayas and prevented a harmonious reconciliation for many centuries.
We can envision this split as a natural dichotomy in the development of whole
systems (including cultures), in which the Mystery Play of polarization and even¬
tual reconciliation is the name of the game, an organic necessity much like cell
mitosis. Polarization and reunification are a process that manifests on all levels of
life. The process is identifiable in a person's life, in the dynamics of social and
philosophical movements, within schools of thought, and in societies and civiliza¬
tions as a whole. This model is in accord with the progressive science of whole
systems dynamics. A schism may appear in what was previously a whole unto
Diagram 76. Map of Mesoamerica: 1) Maya
zone, 2) Toltec zone, 3) Maya-Toltec zone



CHICHEN ITZA COSMOLOGY: MAYA-TOLTEC RECONCILIATION / 141
itself; a polarization of opposite tendencies or ideas then develops, until complete
opposition defines the mutually arisen need for each other, thus initiating the move
to reunification. We can identify eras in social movements or civilizations as either
divergent or convergent. The questions that naturally arise upon considering these
historical facts are: What defined the differences between ancient Maya and Toltec
cosmo-conception, and how and where did those differences get reconciled? The
answers are found when we look at the two different methods used by the Toltec
and the Maya to track World Ages. I believe that these differences led to the age-old
fundamental schism between Toltec and Maya thought—the rift in the Meso
american psyche.
So far in Part II, we have been concerned with reconstructing two different
methods used by Mesoamerican skywatchers to track precession. One is called the
Zenith Cosmology and the other is the Galactic Cosmology. The Toltecs of
Teotihuacan, living in the early years of the first millennium of the Christian era,
counted World Ages with a fifty-two-year period known as the Calendar Round.
With it, they initiated the Fifth Sun (or World Age) at Teotihuacan and projected its
end some time in the distant future. Their New Fire ceremony became critical to
our understanding of how they used the Calendar Round to track precession. The
Toltec Fire Priests, you will remember, performed the New Fire ceremony at the end
of each Calendar Round, during which they carefully observed the Pleiades passing
through the zenith at midnight. When the day on which it did this shifted (as a
result of precession), the Toltec astronomer-priests adjusted their World Age calen¬
dar and knew they were moving closer to the much anticipated ending of the Fifth
Sun.
The Toltecs believed that the next World Age would begin when the Pleiades
aligned with the first zenith passage of the sun in May, and this is the phenomenon
they tracked with their Calendar Round and New Fire ceremony. This zenith align¬
ment was conceived as a World Age birth, but its precise timing is dependent upon
one's latitude of observation. At the latitude of Toltec Teotihuacan, it occurred in
the early nineteenth century. The Fifth Sun thus seems to have already ended. How¬
ever, the timing shifted when the Toltecs transported the Zenith Cosmology to
Chichen Itza, whose latitude is a little further to the north and therefore offers a
later calculation for the World Age shift.
As argued in Chapters 7 and 8, the high god of the Toltec pantheon that repre¬
sented the Zenith Cosmology was Quetzalcoatl, whose earliest astronomical asso



142 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
ciation is with the Pleiades.2 According to scholars, Quetzalcoatl emerged into
Mesoamerican consciousness at Teotihuacan around the third century a.d., the same
time the New Fire ceremony began to be performed. The Pleiades were known as
the serpent's rattle, and the flight of the Pleiades into alignment with the zenith
sun evoked the image of a flying serpent—the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl.
As for the Maya, they too were tracking precession as the basis of their World
Age doctrine, but they were concerned with a completely different astronomical
alignment, the solstice-Galaxy conjunction of a.d. 2012. They used the Long Count
calendar (rather than the Calendar Round) to track this precessional alignment,
which they calculated to occur on the Long Count date 13.0.0.0.0. The Mayas'
World Age cosmology concerned itself with a rare and profound galactic synchro¬
nization—the conver¬
gence of our Earth-sun
system's solstice merid¬
ian with the larger galac¬
tic frame of time. This
Diagram 77. Captain Sun Disk is the Zero Point of the
Galactic Cycle of pre¬
cession, an event that previously occurred 26,000 years ago. The early Maya
skywatchers understood this vast time cycle and brilliantly devised the Long Count
calendar to end precisely on the Galactic Zero Point. Because this cosmology in¬
volved the movement of the solstice sun, the supreme avatar of the Maya pan¬
theon was Ahau, the solstice Sun Deity, pictured at Chichen Itza as a solar warrior
within a Sun Disk. Among many Maya scholars, including Arthur Miller, Linda
Scheie, and David Freidel, the preferred name
for this deity is Captain Sun Disk.3
Another "captain" of high rank in the Chi¬
chen Itza murals was dubbed Captain Serpent,
who is none other than the snake deity Quetzal
coatl-Kukulcan—the avatar of the Zenith Cos¬
mology. Captain Serpent is portrayed with a
rattlesnake wrapped around him.
Significantly, as pictured on murals throughout Chichen Itza, these two gods
formed an alliance. As such, Chichen Itza was the site of an ongoing cultural
cosmological experiment through which the schism in the collective psyche of



CHICHEN ITZA COSMOLOGY: MAYA-TOLTEC RECONCILIATION / 143
ancient Mesoamerica was healed.
Historically, after Teotihuacan in Central Mexico fell around a.d. 750, Chichen
Itza (formerly primarily a Maya city) received a flood of Toltec immigrants, who
brought with them their own brand of World Age cosmology and myth. By the end
of the tenth baktun in a.d. 830, many of Chichen Itza's most fascinating structures
were built, aligned to the heavens in specific though complex ways. The new chap¬
ter in the history of Chichen Itza was stimulated by fresh ideas from the west,
resulting in the synthesis and reconciliation of the two primary cosmological sys¬
tems previously described. We will see evidence for this pact between the Toltec
and Maya worldviews as we proceed to explore some of Chichen's lesser-known
cosmic alignments.
COSMIC ALIGNMENTS AT CHICHEN ITZA
Any discussion of the astronomical alignments at Chichen Itza must begin
with the Caracol observatory, where astronomer Anthony Aveni and his colleagues
identified several significant astronomical orientations. Windows in the ruined upper
tower point toward the extreme northern and southern rise positions of Venus. The
equinox sunset is visible through another window in the tower. The orientation of
the base of the entire structure indicates that the astronomical positioning of the
Caracol was intentional. The corner-to-corner alignment of the base corresponds
with the solstice axis. A perpendicular line from the base of the upper platform
points to the location on the horizon where the sun sets on the dates of its zenith
passage at the latitude of Chichen Itza—May 20-25 and July 22-27.4 According to
Aveni, around a.d. 1000 the last annual setting of the Pleiades could be viewed in
late April from a window in the Caracol's upper tower. In addition to the Caracol's
alignments with the Pleiades, the zenith sun, the solstice axis, the equinox, and the
setting extremes of Venus, Aveni found fifteen other alignments that correspond
reasonably well with astronomical events.
The shadow serpent that descends the Pyramid of Kukulcan on the equinox
has already been discussed. Briefly, in my recent work on the astronomy and my¬
thology of this event, I discovered an unrecognized facet that completes the mythic
message. As previously explained, the serpent is a well-known symbol of the sun.
In addition, Yucatecan rattlesnakes often have a natural "solar face" design near
the rattle, reinforcing their meaning as solar divinities. In the Yucatec Maya lan



144/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
guage, the rattle is called tzab, which is also the name for the Pleiades. At ancient
Chichen Itza, New Year's Day was celebrated on one of the zenith-passage dates,
suggesting that solar zenith passages were very important as temporal beginning
and ending points. My reconstruction of the true meaning of the Toltec New Fire
ceremony, transplanted to Chichen, proposes that this ceremony was really about
tracking when, in the remote future, the Pleiades conjunct the sun on the solar
zenith-passage date. Due to precession, this complex astronomical convergence now
occurs at Chichen Itza every May 20, when the sun and the Pleiades are conjunct
within the prescribed six-day range for zenith-passage dates at Chichen. The my¬
thology of Kukulcan descending, in relation to the symbology of the rattle (the
Pleiades) and the snake (the zenith sun), points directly to the May 20 event, sixty
days after the equinox. Thus, the Pyramid of Kukulcan is a cosmic myth set in
stone, pointing straight up to the zenith, where an astronomical alignment sugges¬
tive of World Age transformation occurs in the twenty-first century a.d. As if the
equinox shadow-serpent manifestation alone is not enough to inspire an awesome
respect for ancient Maya cosmology, this World Age myth, clearly alluded to by the
equinox event itself, is worthy of being called the greatest calendrical
architectural achievement known. A compelling event is beginning to transpire
the sun and the Pleiades joined in the zenith over Chichen Itza—that will extend
through the next century and then fall out of sync, never to happen again. This is
the era of World Age transformation as formulated by the ancient Toltecs. The
players, as with other alignments at Chichen, are the Pleiades and the zenith sun.
As is now clear, however, this was only one method used by the ancient Meso
american skywatchers to track precession. The other involved the Maya Long Count
calendar, the Milky Way, and the solstice sun. These mytho-astronomical players
are found in Chichen's ballcourt alignments.
The High Priest's Grave, a small ruin in the old section of Chichen near the
Caracol, is a miniature model of Kukulcan's pyramid. Scholars have been unable to
precisely examine its orientation because of its eroded condition. Interestingly,
however, they found a large chamber underneath the small pyramid and identified
it as the tomb of a shaman or priest. A Long Count date found in this underground
chamber is a solstice date from the ninth century.5 As described in Chapter 11, the
Great Ballcourt aligned with the Milky Way on solstice dates in the mid-ninth
century, the point being that solstice dates as well as equinox dates were appar¬
ently significant for Chichen's calendar keepers.



CHICHEN ITZA COSMOLOGY: MAYA-TOLTEC RECONCILIATION / 145
Finally, scholars have determined that the Pyramid of Kukulcan was built
around the end of the tenth baktun in a.d. 830, when the Toltec Calendar Round
ending happened to synchronize with the Maya baktun ending.6 This significant
calendric convergence offered the Maya-Toltec thinkers a rare opportunity to rec¬
oncile the two main streams of cosmological thought in Mesoamerica—the
recalibration of the Toltec Calendar Round with the Maya Long Count. The year
a.d. 830, which is 10.0.0.0.0 in the Long Count, was the date of this incredible
calendric opportunity, and this is when most of the amazing astronomical struc¬
tures at Chichen were designed and built. For this reason as well as others, Chichen
looms as a place of calendrical and cosmological unification.7
The Great Ballcourt, the largest ballcourt known in the ancient Maya world, lies
a short distance to the northwest of the Pyramid of Kukulcan. As discussed in the
previous chapter, it encodes many alignments, most notably ones involving the Milky
Way and the solstices. For instance, the Great Ballcourt was aligned with the Milky
Way at midnight on the June solstices around a.d. 865. This means that if you stood
in the center of the ballcourt at midnight on one of these solstice dates, you would
have seen the Milky Way arching overhead,
touching the opposed horizons to which the
lengthwise axis of the ballcourt points. Over¬
head, you would have seen the place where the
Milky Way and the ecliptic cross.
This intersection forms the cross-shaped
cosmic ballcourt—a symbol important for its
role in the Long Count end-date of a.d. 2012.
Simply put, the center of this cosmic cross is
where the December solstice sun will be in
2012.
The mural on the east wall of the ball
court shows the primary ballplayer—in reality a high deity—being decapitated. Flis
severed head becomes the gameball, which the players then must kick into the
goalring. This scenario is a metaphor for the December solstice sun moving slowly
into its "goal"—the dark-rift near the cosmic cross formed by the Milky Way and
the ecliptic. Within the metaphor of the ballgame, the dark-rift "cave" is the goalring,
and the severed head or gameball is the December solstice sun.
You may recall that the actual stone goalring of the ballcourt's east wall is

above and to the left of the mural depicting the severed head as the gameball. As
high noon approaches on the June solstice, a shadow cast from this stone goalring
slowly moves along the mural toward and finally through the gameball. The effect
is that of the ball moving slowly through the goalring as high noon approaches on
the solstice. This shadow-play alludes to the mythic meaning of the ballgame as a
metaphor for the alignment of the 2012 end-date. The December solstice sun con¬
verges upon and conjuncts the dark-rift "goalring" in the center of the cosmic Milky
Way ballcourt only in the years surrounding a.d. 2012. Like Chichen's Toltec Ze¬
nith Cosmology, this alignment is an effect of the precession of the equinoxes, and
occurs in the early twenty-first century.
The astounding sophistication of this hierophany, in the architectural engi¬
neering as well as in the intended mythological meaning, almost eclipses the
mind-boggling profundity of the shadow-serpent manifestation on Kukulcan's pyra¬
mid. But we are not finished with the Great Ballcourt yet. One more alignment,
one that confirms Chichen's role as the site where the Zenith Cosmology and the
Galactic Cosmology were merged, occurs above the east wall mural, in the Upper
Temple of the Jaguars (see diagram 71).
The Upper Temple of the Jaguars is a small building constructed over the east¬
ern wall of the Great Ballcourt. Its west-facing doorway provides a clear view of the
flat horizon. The doorway is a wide portal leading into the inner chamber, and is
flanked on both sides by serpent columns. These are stone sculptures of the in¬
verted serpent image that is found throughout Chichen Itza, reminiscent of the
equinoctial shadow-serpent that appears on the Pyramid of Kukulcan. Inside the
chamber, several murals were still visible in the late nineteenth century, but are
now completely deteriorated. Luckily, Adela Breton made detailed drawings of them
in 1906.8 One of the murals within the Upper Temple of the Jaguars depicts two
beings of equal stature and is situated such that the rays of the setting sun on its
date of zenith passage illuminate it.9 This is, litdrally, where the secret history of
Chichen comes to light.
THE UNION OF CAPTAIN SERPENT AND CAPTAIN SUN DISK
Based upon Breton's drawings, there was enough information in the murals to
identify the two beings as none other than Captain Sun Disk and Captain Serpent,
the mytho-historical figures found throughout Chichen, who played an important

Although these two characters may have had some meaning as actual his¬
torical figures, their mythological role, as representatives of the Toltec and Maya
cosmologies, is more important. The biannual zenith illumination of their meet¬
ing symbolizes, and serves as a reminder of, the political and cosmological alli¬
ance formed between the Toltec and Maya civilizations. Captain Sun Disk repre¬
sents the Maya ideal of a cosmic ruler and symbolizes the prevailing Maya cos¬
mology of the solstice sun disk moving toward the Milky Way. Captain Serpent is
the Toltec avatar associated with the feathered serpent, Quetzalcoatl (that is, with
the World Age cosmology involving the Pleiades moving toward the zenith sun).10
In that the Mesoamerican schism formed after the fall of the Olmec, the recon¬
ciliation of Captain Sun Disk and Captain Serpent was probably almost three
baktuns in the making. And they came together to recognize and agree that it
would be another three baktuns before the end times—the era of World Age re¬
newal—would arrive.
The joining of these cosmic avatars of the Toltec and Maya peoples represents
a reconciliation of the ancient schism in the Mesoamerican psyche, which I believe
occurred at Chichen Itza in the ninth century a.d. It was a reconciliation of two
different branches of what was, after all, basically a shared cosmological discovery:
the precession of the equinoxes. Both traditions competed to identify the future
World Age transition by tracking the precession of the equinoxes. However, early
in Mesoamerican history, perhaps around 50 b.c., the two different precession¬
tracking methods were formulated that resulted in two slightly different timings.
This gave rise to a cosmological conflict—a disagreement on the very important
and basic concept of when the next World Age would arrive. We might imagine this
conflict to be similar to modern battles between Israel and Palestine, battles arising



148 / MAYA COSMOGENESI5 2012
from serious social, religious, and political differences, even though these two tra¬
ditions spring from the same source. In fact, a polarization of opposed ideals seems
to be the underlying root of basic social and philosophical problems in the world
today. The possibility of successfully reconciling such differences, on the scale of
civilizations, is attested to by what was accomplished at Chichen Itza.
The original Toltec tracking method, based upon calculations made at the lati¬
tude of Teotihuacan, resulted in a World Age shift to occur in the early nineteenth
century. Early on, however, the Toltecs noticed their end-date cosmology was not
in accord with the Maya Long Count system, which predicted the Zero Point of
precession in the early twenty-first century. For the two systems and the schism in
Mesoamerican civilization to be reconciled, some adjustment had to be made some¬
where. What occurred is clear: The Toltec Zenith Cosmology was adjusted when
the Toltecs relocated to the latitude of Chichen Itza, effectively bringing it into line
with the Long Count end-date.
Captain Sun Disk and Captain Serpent each represent the fully manifest ideal
of their respective cosmologies. Having achieved full polarization and complete
expression, they could then meet and be reconciled. This was no doubt a recogni¬
tion by the Toltec-Maya alliance of the deeper process of civilization of which they
were a part—an intentional decision to adapt, compromise, reconcile, and integrate
into a new level of unity rather than violently break down into separatist camps.
The successful reunification achieved by Chichen's Toltec and Maya inhabitants is
evident in the intentional blending of their respective calendar cosmologies around
a.d. 830. The pact between the Toltec and the Maya was formed at this time, anointed
by solar alignment, and preserved in stone for future generations. The years follow¬
ing the alliance saw massive monuments built and dedicated to consecrate the
pact, and to point anyone with eyes to see to the World Age shift now agreed upon
by both systems.
The Pyramid of Kukulcan represents the Toltec New Fire system that points,
after a slight adjustment upon the Toltec relocation to the latitude of Chichen Itza,
to the early twenty-first century. The Great Ballcourt's alignment with the Milky
Way, as well as the symbology of the ballgame itself, reminds us of the solstice
convergence with the portal to the next world—the Maya Galactic Cosmology that
likewise identifies a World Age shift to occur in the early twenty-first century (a.d.
2012).

TIME WILLTELL
At Chichen Itza, Captain Sun Disk (the cosmic avatar of the Maya) and Cap¬
tain Serpent (the cosmic avatar of the Toltec) joined to create a new, hybrid cosmol¬
ogy, a meta-system synthesizing the best insights of both traditions. Their union is
commemorated twice a year by the setting zenith-date sun that illuminates the
mural depicting their pact. The Upper Temple of the Jaguars and the pact sealed
inside combine the solar zenith criterion (its orientation to the setting sun on the
date of zenith passage) with the Milky Way criterion (the Great Ballcourt) as sym¬
bols of unity and reconciliation. The mythology and astronomy of the Zenith Cos¬
mology and the Galactic Cosmology were united: The Toltecs and the Maya began
to act as one. Both cultural traditions joined in the powerful proclamation that
what we call the twenty-first century, measured with two different cosmological
alignments in the Great Year of precession, would be a great era of transformation
for humanity, one in which an old world is destroyed and a new world rises from
the ashes. According to both Maya and Toltec myth, humanity saves itself at these
critical nexus points only by transforming, by mutating into something totally
unrecognizable, a new being altogether. What this will be, only time will tell.
The two cosmological systems unified at Chichen Itza drew together many
aspects of Mesoamerican culture. Each system belonged to a specific culture, each
had its own tracking calendar, and each had an explanatory myth or ceremonial
tradition to go with it.

The Galactic Cosmology actually had several "myths" that encoded its con¬
cepts: the Hero Twin myth and the ballgame Mystery Play, as well as birthing sym¬
bols and king accession rites. We explored the ballgame in detail first because it



150/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
directly implicates Chichen Itza by way of its ballcourt alignments and it encodes
the Galactic Cosmology in a straightforward way. We now need to explore the Hero
Twin myth and related folklore in greater detail, to deepen our appreciation for how
Maya mythology encodes the astronomical meaning of the Long Count end-date.
This examination will lead us progressively into new insights about the nature of
Maya shamanism, birthing rituals, and king initiations. We will see anew how the
Maya conceptualized cosmogenesis, and get to the root of what the Galactic Cos¬
mology is all about. What will emerge is persuasive evidence of the Mayas' ancient
and profound understanding of cosmological processes, including galactic forces
that impinge upon the evolution of life on earth—a paradigm that supersedes any¬
thing yet encountered by Western science.

MAYA COSMOGENESIS
From a practical point of view, a culture as ancient, numerate and
chronologically sophisticated as that of Mesoamerica is more likely
than not to have detected and then measured the phenomenon of
precession ... the great year of equinoctial precession emerges as a
missing link between the local and political chronology of our era
and the vast evolutionary philosophy of time so vividly testified to
in the Popol Vuh.

CHAPTER 13
THE BIRTH OFTHE HERO TWIN5
T
he magical conception of the Hero Twins is an important episode in the Popol
Vuh. When we remember that myth and astronomy go together, it is not sur¬
prising that this mythic narrative is based upon astronomy, and that we may be
able to identify the real-time astronomical event that signified the conception of
Hunahpu and Xbalanque and, therefore, the era in which their story was created.
An important question we will be able to answer is, who is the real mother of the
Hero Twins? In the Popol Vuh, she is called X'quic, which means Blood Woman or
Blood Moon. However, as we will see, other considerations suggest she is more
than just the moon.
After One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu journey to Xibalba and fail at all the
tests presented them, they are killed and One Hunahpu's head is hung in a calabash
tree by a road. Soon thereafter, Blood Moon, a daughter of one of the lesser Lords of
Xibalba, comes along and is intrigued with the skull-tree. She speaks with the skull
but does not know it is One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu acting together "as one
mind." The skull spits into Blood Moon's hand, magically impregnating her. She
continues on her way, is eventually banished to the surface of the Earth, and gives
birth to the Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque.
If we can decipher enough astronomy in this myth, we can take what we find
and search astronomy software for dates that represent the astronomical event cor
155



156 / MAYA COSMOCENE5IS 20M
responding to the conception of the Hero Twins. The works of Dennis Tedlock,
translator of the Hero Twin myth, provide all of the key astronomical identifica¬
tions involved in the Hero Twin story.1 According to Tedlock's interpretation, Blood
Moon is the waning post-full moon, the sliver-shaped moon that rises in the east
just before sunrise.2 The skull that speaks "belongs" to both One Hunahpu and
Seven Hunahpu, and they speak through it with "one mind."3 One Hunahpu (the
calendric day 1 Ahau) represents Venus, and Seven Hunahpu represents Jupiter.4
The skull that speaks therefore represents the conjunction of these two bright plan¬
ets. As a calendric year-bearer associated with the seasonal quarters, the resurrected
One Hunahpu represents the December solstice sun, and his rebirth was only pos¬
sible through the efforts of his sons, the Hero Twins. Thus, in our search for the
mytho-astronomical conception of the Hero Twins, we should be open to the possi¬
bility that a December solstice date may also be involved.
The Venus-Jupiter "skull" was hung in the fork of a tree. The tree itself is the
Milky Way, and it happens to "stand by the road" (the ecliptic).5 This astronomical
configuration suggests a cross formed by the Milky Way and the ecliptic. According
to Tedlock, this cross designates the entrance place to Xibalba, the xibalba be,
which the modern Quiche Maya identify astronomically as the dark cleft in the
Milky Way whose southern terminus touches the ecliptic near Sagittarius.6 The
dark-rift also was mythologized as a divine birthplace. Importantly, the crook or
cleft in the calabash tree where One Hunahpu's skull was hung is identified by
Tedlock as this dark-rift in the Milky Way.7 So, the fork in the calabash tree where
the conjunction of Venus (One Hunahpu) and Jupiter (Seven Hunahpu) occurs is
synonymous with the dark-rift in the Milky Way. We now have identified a definite
location for the Venus-Jupiter conjunction.
We can narrow down the astronomical scope even further because Blood Moon
swings by for a visit. As mentioned, Blood Moon is the waning post-full moon, a
sliver in the predawn eastern sky. Since Venus never swings more than 47° from
the sun, in either its morning star or evening star phase, the Venus-Jupiter-moon
syzygy must occur in the xibalba be less than 47° west of the sun. This puts them
in the predawn sky in late fall or early winter. In fact, considering that we will be
looking at likely dates beginning with the earliest version of the Hero Twin myth
at Izapa, some 2,100 years ago, the required scenario must occur not more than
twenty-five days before the December solstice and not more than eighteen days
after the December solstice. The reason: 2,100 years ago the December solstice sun



THE BIRTH OF THE HERO TWINS / 157
was 30° east of the xibalba be (the required place of Venus-Jupiter). So, twenty-five
days prior to the December solstice defines a minimum 5° spread for predawn vis¬
ibility; likewise, more than eighteen days after the December solstice exceeds
the 47° maximum possible distance between the dark-rift (the conjunction place)
and the sun. This temporal span is obviously precession-related, because by the
year a.d. 2000 the December solstice sun is right in the xibalba be, while 2,100
years ago there was a 30° separation, allowing the Jupiter-Venus-moon conjunction
to be visible in the predawn eastern sky.
With these constraints, we can next decide in what era we should begin the
search. The conception of the Hero Twin episode in the Popol Vuh may have con¬
tained the astronomical meaning in its earliest form. Hero Twin adventures appear
on the monuments of Izapa between 500 b.c. and a.d. 50, providing a range to guide
our search.8
To begin, we should track when Jupiter conjuncts the xibalba be. Since Venus
parameters limit this search to within twenty-five days before and eighteen days
after the December solstice, we can narrow down the range even more. Also, re¬
membering that the December solstice sun was the "first sun" or "first day"—a
new beginning or birthtime—we should be on the lookout for what occurs on De¬
cember solstice dates.
Searching my astronomy software9 for Jupiter-Venus-moon conjunctions in the
xibalba be, I found that there are distinct fifty-nine-year intervals at which our
syzygy tends to repeat (a syzygy is a triple conjunction). Amazingly, the precision of
this complex three-way conjunction tends to maximize around December solstice
dates in the second century b.c. To make some tedious research brief, let me share
only the results. I checked all
of the dates between 556 b.c.
and a.d. 51 on which this triple
conjunction occurred. Of the
fifty-three dates that met the
criteria, sixteen are worth men¬
tioning, although only four or
five provide a distinct picture of
a Jupiter-Venus-moon syzygy in
the xibalba be.
All of these star-map dates

158 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 20M
were charted with the Gregorian
calendar. The earliest syzygy of 532
b.c. was notable because it appears
that the moon occulted Venus. In
other words, the conjunction was so
close that the moon passed right
over, or occulted, Venus. This sky
picture certainly illustrates the in¬
timacy necessary for impregnation.
The next date shows a tolerably
close conjunction of Jupiter-Venus
moon in thexibalba be. Notice that
diagrams 82 and 83 depict a realis¬
tic representation of the Milky Way and its dark-rift—the mouth of the Cosmic
Monster and birth canal of the Great Mother. Nothing notable occurs between 508
b.c. and 307 b.c. with the exception of a Jupiter-Mars conjunction with the dark-rift
on the date December 25, 331 b.c. However, by 224 b.c., the sky once again gets
interesting.
On this date, Jupiter, Venus, and the moon are nicely grouped in the dark-rift
mouth, and Saturn is roughly 20° to the west of them. This is the first in a series of
four especially notable dates, separated by fifty-nine years each.
On December 17, 189 b.c., Jupiter, Venus, and the moon were roughly con¬
junct, but were some 5° west of the dark-rift. I noticed that after a two hundred year
period of inactivity between 508 b.c. and
307 b.c., notable dates were not only in¬
creasing but were approaching the De¬
cember solstice date. The next date,
December 22, 165 b.c., occurs right on
the December solstice.
Diagram 85 shows the mytho-astro
nomical picture of Jupiter, Venus, and
the moon in close conjunction in the
dark-rift, with Mars some 15° further off
to the west. The position of Mars means
it rose first in the predawn sky, followed



THE BIRTH OF THE HERO TWINS / 159
by Venus and then the closely paired Jupiter-moon. This is the second date in a
series of notable dates, each separated by fifty-nine years. Neptune happens to be
within 1° of Mars on this date but it would not have been visible to the naked eye.
The next notable date, December 28, 106 b.c., moves us further away from the
December solstice date, showing a loose grouping of Jupiter-Venus-moon around
the dark-rift, with Saturn in the
mix. Finally, on January 6, 46 b.c.,
an unusual Jupiter-Venus-moon
conjunction occurred near the
dark-rift mouth, again with Saturn
in the picture. However, Jupiter
was some 7° further west of the
dark-rift mouth, further out than
Saturn, while Venus and the moon
were very close.
A lot of theoretical mythic as¬
tronomy must have been occurring
during the period between 224 b.c.
and 46 b.c. The conjunctions in 46
b.c., 106 b.c., 165 b.c. and 224 b.c. all provide fairly good sky-pictures of what we
know was mythologized in the Hero Twin Creation myth as the conception of the
Hero Twins. This range of dates parallels the time of the Izapan civilization's devel¬
opment and growth. The 165 b.c. date in particular is intriguing because it occurred
on the December solstice. It is also one of the most precise of all the sky pictures.
At the very least, the astronomical events that occurred on these dates suggest
ancient astronomer-priests were yoking their new myths to the Cosmic Mother's
dark-rift "birth canal" in the sky—the xibalba be. If the Izapan skywatchers had
been aware of the fifty-nine-year interval separating these triple conjunctions, they
would have anticipated one in a.d. 13. That a compelling triple conjunction did not
occur on this date may have disappointed them. Ironically, it was right around this
time that Izapa is thought to have gone into decline. On the other hand, they might
have been well aware that the sacred syzygy came in groupings that eventually fell
out of synchronization.
The barrage of syzygy dates in the second and first centuries b.c. is very com¬
pelling, especially because they occurred after a two hundred year period devoid of



meaningful conjunctions. For this reason alone, ancient
skywatchers might have paid close attention to them.
The new cycle of syzygies may even have been so pro¬
vocative to the early skywatchers of Izapa that they felt
compelled to mythologize them. What we do know for
sure is that, at some point, the triple conjunction of
Jupiter, Venus, and the moon in the dark-rift became
the celestial signature of the mythological conception
of the Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque. I am fairly
certain that this mythic formulation occurred on one
of the most compelling dates listed, probably the one
on the December solstice of 165 b.c.10
Having decoded and applied the astronomical iden¬
tifications in the Hero Twin myth, it seemed to me that I had successfully identi¬
fied the astronomical event that signified the conception and birth of the Hero
Twins. In the astronomical evidence rallied here, the dark-rift is reinforced as a
conception place in ancient Mesoamerican mytho-astronomy, a Creation Place.
Hunahpu's and Xbalanque's mythological conception, which I have located in real
time with its astronomical signature, may also indicate their germinal entry into
early Maya myth and folk consciousness. As such, their "conception" must go
back to Izapa. Importantly, several Izapan monuments illustrate the Hero Twin
conception myth. For example, the Milky Way calabash tree is depicted on Stela
10, under which the Hero Twins are shown umbilically connected to their mother,
Blood Moon.
It seems that the dramatic conjunctions observed in the middle of baktun 7
inspired several ideas among the Izapan cosmonauts. One was that the dark-rift in
the Milky Way was a Creation Place. Another was that the December solstice was
a Creation Time. Since the Long Count ends with a conjunction also involving the
dark-rift in the Milky Way and the December solstice sun, the Hero Twin astronomy
might have lent itself to the formulation of the Long Count. Overall, however, we
can suggest an answer for the question posed at the beginning of this chapter: Who
is the real mother of the Hero Twins? She is the Milky Way, or the moon in con¬
junction with the Milky Way.

nating her with the Hero Twins. The astronomical syzygy between Jupiter, Venus,

THE BIRTH OF THE HERO TWINS / 161
and the moon—the three brightest celestial objects after the sun—is a fairly fre¬
quent event. However, its occurrence in a specific sidereal location such as the
Great Mother's birthplace is less frequent. In tracking this triple conjunction's oc¬
currences with astronomy software, I noticed that it occurs at fifty-nine-year inter¬
vals for three or four cycles but then goes out of sync. Presumably, a different
phase-cycle will then come to prominence, be useful for a few fifty-nine-year peri¬
ods, and then also pass. At any rate, the skull spat frequently, and we might pre¬
sume that, for the ancient astronomers, any time the celestial syzygy occurred, the
conception of the Hero Twins was recalled. If so, it seems the ancient Mesoamerican
skywatchers were capable of impressive and sophisticated astronomy, as well as
imaginative myth-making based on those astronomical observations.
The fact that one of the most compelling triple-conjunction dates occurs on the
December solstice leads us to recall Stela 11 (diagram 57), and its depiction of the
Izapan December solstice sunrise that we ex¬
amined earlier. Like the celestial rebirth of One
Hunahpu on Creation Day, the conception of
Hunahpu and Xbalanque also occurs near the
xibalba be. In this way we can use that same
skyview from Izapa to illustrate the astronomi¬
cal meaning of the Hero Twins' dramatic,
mytho-astronomical conception. The players
are One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu (Venus
and Jupiter), Blood Moon, the xibalba be, and
the first day of the year, the December solstice.
As we have seen from this close look at
the sources of the Hero Twins' mythological
conception and birth, Maya myth speaks the
language of the stars and planets, and its study
can open us to a new way of relating to the cosmos, one that receives the whispered
messages of far off celestial events. The Hero Twin myth itself is a rich source of
calendric and astronomical information. Based upon our calendrical, astronomical,
and mythological studies, it is becoming more and more clear that the Hero Twin
myth and the Long Count calendar arose at the same time, in the same place, and
that they work together to elucidate the end-date cosmology. Given that the Long
Count is a calendar that calibrates precession, we can surmise that the Hero Twin

ing the cosmic conception of the Hero
Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque. Decem¬
ber solstice, 165 b.c.



Creation myth encodes precessional knowledge and is therefore an esoteric World
Age doctrine. But how exactly does the Hero Twin Creation story describe preces¬
sion? How is it connected to the Long Count? And why do I assume that a myth
must arise with the discovery of precession?
To answer these questions, we must understand that disparate ancient cul¬
tures who derived their worldviews from observing the natural world, a natural
world that includes the sky, might have formulated very similar ideas. As
archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni said, "In ancient societies, the sky and its con¬
tents lay at the very foundation of human cognition,"11 meaning that the shared
backdrop of the night sky provides celestial dramas that were mythologized by
diverse peoples in similar ways. Armed with this perspective, we can search the
globe for cultures challenged by the discovery of precession to understand what
took place in the New World as cosmological understanding evolved. For example,
how did philosophical assumptions change when precession was discovered in the
Old World? It just so happens, as we mentioned earlier, that Mithraism arose in the
Old World upon the discovery of precession by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus.
Amazingly, these Old World events took place in the first century b.c., precisely
when the enigmatic Izapan civilization was in full swing, inventing the Long Count
and devising the Hero Twin Creation myth. Let us pause for a moment and take a
look at this strange trans-Atlantic parallel, which will help us understand that the
development of the Hero Twin myth as an esoteric precession doctrine is not with¬
out precedent.
THE HERO TWIN MYTH AS PRECESSION DOCTRINE
The Popol Vuh describes a succession of World Ages, each one ending in cata¬
clysm. The current age is the one in which the Hero Twins endeavor to resurrect
their father, One Hunahpu, and it ends when the Lords of Xibalba are defeated in
the Underworld Ballcourt and One Hunahpu is reborn. Before any of this takes
place, however, the Hero Twins must do away with Seven Macaw, the vain and
false ruler of the previous World Age. Seven Macaw, as noted earlier, was identified
with the Big Dipper and this, in addition to the other facts already sketched, shows
quite clearly that a great deal of astronomy was encoded into the Hero Twin myth.
World Age doctrines are not unique to Mesoamerica. From India to China to
Finland to Egypt, a deep and profound Mystery of the Ages peeks out at us from the



THE BIRTH OF THE HERO TWINS / 163
fragmented ancient myths of shifting epochs of humanity. The book Hamlet’s Mill
is now, after pioneering a new approach, only one book among many to argue that
World Age myths are derived from knowledge of the precession of the equinoxes.
The Hero Twin Creation myth is a classic Mesoamerican example of a World Age
myth, and so we may expect that knowledge of precession lurks within it. And
indeed that is the case. I have already argued that a primary event in the Popol Vuh,
the rebirth of First Father/One Hunahpu, symbolizes the precession-caused end-date
alignment. One Hunahpu's resurrection and his claiming of his throne in the cos¬
mic center symbolize the December solstice sun's movement into conjunction with
the great bulge of the Galactic Center, an event that culminates in a.d. 2012. In this
way, the Hero Twin myth encodes a rare alignment in precession, and can thus be
considered an esoteric World Age doctrine with precession as its deepest secret
message. The larger question, however, is how and why the discovery of precession
alters the worldview of its discoverers.
We can observe how the discovery of precession exerts changes on cosmologi¬
cal ideas by looking at the situation in the Old World at the time Hipparchus
"discovered" precession in 128 b.c. Although the Greek astronomers were quite
sophisticated, they believed in the erroneous doctrine that the stars are eternally
fixed. It was inconceivable and heretical for them to accept that the stars actually
belong to a slow shifting—that the constellations slip backward over long periods
of time. But Hipparchus proved that this is the case—that the rise times of stars
shift—and he calculated this "Platonic Year" to be 36,000 years long. He was wrong
by a long shot, but the precise calibration is not the issue. The point is that his
discovery shook the foundations of Greek cosmology. We can only imagine the
distress this radical new doctrine must have caused the standard bearers of
Greco-Roman science. They may have feared that this knowledge would cause a
breakdown in society as a whole, should common people get wind of an unstable
sky. They probably decided that this dangerous knowledge should be available
only to the elect, to the few who could demonstrate their ability to comprehend its
profound meaning.
And so Mithraism arose, a Mystery Cult whose highest initiatory experience
was the revelation of precession as the cause for the shifting destinies of humanity
through vast epochs. Mithraic ceremonies were closely guarded, taking place in
caves and constructed underground chambers. Still, the new stellar religion spread
wildly in the first century b.c., with sanctuaries springing up from North Africa to



Scotland, wherever the Romans went. The highest
deity, Mithras, was often depicted slaying a bull, sym¬
bolizing his dominion over the axial shifting of the
sky and elevating him as the one who ended the Age
of Taurus (the Bull). As such, Mithras was the Prime
Mover and God of Precession. His birthday was the
December solstice.
Mithraism competed with Christianity for future
status as a global religion, and there are many simi¬
larities between the two religions. Jesus and Mithras
were both born on the December solstice.12 Early
Christianity is filled with astrological symbolism;
Mithraic sanctuaries depict zodiac scenes. But Mith¬
raism was an initiatory Mystery Play, a direct revela¬
tion and personal experience of divinity, akin to the
earlier mysteries of Delphi and Eleusis. Christianity,
on the other hand, came to espouse a path to God accessible only through Jesus.
One can only wonder what the world would look like today had Mithraism suc¬
ceeded in overcoming Christianity.
The Hipparchus-Mithras connection is a perfect example of how the discovery
of precession gives rise to a new explanatory mythology. In Mesoamerica, it is clear
that the Long Count encodes a knowledge of precession, because the 13-baktun-cycle
end-date of a.d. 2012 pinpoints a rare alignment in precession. It also is clear that
the Long Count calendar arose about the same time as did the new Mesoamerican
Creation myth, the Hero Twin myth. As we have seen, this Creation story encodes
the astronomical process that converges in a.d. 2012. The Long Count-Hero Twin
complex is another typical example of how precessional knowledge is encoded into
myth. The parallel to Mithraism in the Old World is striking, but not surprising.
One element of the Hero Twin story illustrates how the discovery of preces¬
sion exerts changes on established cosmological doctrine. That the Hero Twins
dispensed with the old Polar God, Seven Macaw, indicates an advance in cosmo¬
logical thinking, one that abandoned a limited polar paradigm and then proceeded
to formulate a cosmological orientation centered upon a new cosmic center, the
Galactic Center. This Mesoamerican "change of the gods" suggests a doctrinal shift
occurred, wherein Mesoamerican cosmologists shifted from a polar-oriented cos



THE BIRTH OF THE HERO TWINS / 165
mology to a Galaxy-centered one. Furthermore, they apparently wanted to high¬
light the Galactic Center as a supreme organizing principle, with One Hunahpu as
the Mesoamerican God of Precession.
In the Old World, Mithras had to destroy the Bull, the god of the zodiacal age of
Taurus, before new zodiacal gods could have their turn. Although Jesus is the god of
the current zodiacal age of Pisces, Mithras himself is the one who turns the axial
wheel of precession and thus presides over the entire process. Likewise, One Hunah¬
pu is the God of the Center, the Galactic Center, and rules during the eras of trans¬
formation in which the December solstice sun conjuncts the Galactic Center. These
are the rare World Age eras in which Earth and humanity experience great suffer¬
ing, tremendous change, and, ultimately, growth.
The ancient Hero Twin myth, formulated during the early days of Izapa, comes
down to us today via the Quiche Popol Vuh, recorded in Guatemala in the 1550s.
The Popol Vuh can be considered a late variant of the ancient Creation myth origi¬
nally formulated 2,100 years ago at Izapa. Being both a myth and a star map, the
Maya Creation myth encodes for us a "lost" Galactic Cosmology. We must ask
ourselves, however, how much of this ancient knowledge was really "lost," for we
can now decode the ancient cosmological paradigm as found in myths and on monu¬
ments, such as the stelae of Izapa and the Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza. Perhaps
it was never lost; perhaps we just could not see it. More importantly, there are more
than six million Maya living today in the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas, and
millions more in Yucatan, Belize, and Quintana Roo. The highland Quiche Maya,
descendants of those who preserved the Popol Vuh, retain star lore that points to
the Galactic Center as a place of profound significance. To this day, they tell stories
that appear to be variants of those recorded in the Popol Vuh, stories of an ancient
time when calendar-priests and vision-seeking shamans gazed into the cosmic cen¬
ter with full consciousness of a deep cosmic knowledge. Secret knowledge has a
way of surviving in the ancient stories, even if the storytellers themselves have
forgotten the true roots of their metaphors. We have uncovered the core of this
"lost" knowledge, and can now pause to look with a discerning eye at some of the
surviving stories in order to deepen our appreciation of the Galactic Cosmology.

CHAPTER 14
A HAWK, A CROSS, AND A MOUTH
I
n the 1970s, Maya ethnographers Barbara Tedlock and Dennis Tedlock were
apprenticed to a Quiche daykeeper named Andres Xiloj. They lived in the vil¬
lage of Momostenango, a traditional Quiche town where the ancient ways are still
followed and the 260-day tzolkin calendar still survives. Barbara Tedlock collected
star lore among the Quiche, and Andres Xiloj told her of a curious legend involving
a hawk and a cross. The story is tied to astronomical events that signal the appro¬
priate times to plant and harvest corn. Although it is quite brief, it is filled with
mytho-astronomical information.
Every year in April, Xic, the Hawk, arrives and lifts the Cross out of the ocean.
Thereafter the rains begin, nourishing the
newly planted corn. By October, the Hawk
comes again, passing through the center of
the sky. This time it drops the Cross into the
southern ocean. This is when the rains cease,
and corn plants are bent in preparation for
harvest. The Hawk disappears in December
and January.
Two constellations are involved in this
myth, the Cross and the Hawk. The Cross,
more commonly called the Thieves' Cross,
consists of stars in Sagittarius.1
Diagram 89. The Maya Thieves’ Cross con¬
stellation in Sagittarius
167



168 / MAYA C0SM06ENE5I5 2012
The striking thing about this constellation is that it resembles the nearby cross
formed by the Milky Way and the ecliptic. Its vertical member is tilted to the left in
the same way that the Milky Way crosses the ecliptic at an angle. Its east-west
member is roughly parallel to the ecliptic just to the north. (Obviously, the ecliptic
is not a visible feature, but the location of its path was known to the Maya). The
visible Thieves' Cross constellation in Sagittarius probably served to remind the
viewer of the less obvious cross of the Milky Way/ecliptic. The parallel seems un¬
likely to be coincidental.
In Maya cosmology, crosses symbolize the cosmic center and, in fact, the Milky
Way/ecliptic cross is targeted on the Galactic Center. In Mesoamerican symbology,
crosses are depicted as a source of rain.2 In the story, when the Hawk picks up the
Cross in its mouth and carries it out of the ocean in April, the rains come. Thus,
crosses and cosmic centers are sources of rain, which sustains life and nurtures
fertility.
As for the Hawk in our story, the Hawk—on one level, refers to the flocks of
Swainson's hawks that migrate through Guatemala in April and October. Migrat¬
ing northward by the thousands in April, they signal that the rains will soon arrive.
Flying southward in October, they tell the Quiche farmer that the dry season is
coming. But in what way do they carry a cross? Well, they don't, but their celestial
counterpart does. The Hawk constellation recognized by the Quiche is found north
of the Thieves' Cross and corresponds to the Aquila (Eagle) constellation of Old
World astronomy. Although the Maya and Old World constellations share the same
image—a bird—we should refrain from assuming that the Maya derived their im¬
age from post-Conquest influence. Aquila is a clear-cut constellation and easily
lends itself to being viewed as a bird, so the Maya likely visualized this star group¬
ing as a hawk, independent of the Aquila/Eagle identification for the same star
grouping in the Old World. In fact, Barbara Tedlock points out that "Hawk" is a
better designation for this constellation, because the wings sweep backward (mir¬
roring the angles of the star group) whereas eagles (Aquila) extend their wings al¬
most straight out during flight. As a result, the head of the Maya Hawk constella¬
tion points downward, or southward, that is, toward the Sagittarian crossing point
of the Milky Way and the ecliptic. As with the Thieves' Cross, the Hawk constella¬
tion is closely associated with the Milky Way: The "body" of this constellation
actually lies along the Milky Way. As such, it appears to fly along the Milky Way,
its head pointing southward. When we chart out the relationship between the Hawk



A HAWK, A CROSS, AND A MOUTH / 169
and the Thieves' Cross constellations, a
hidden astronomical player becomes
quite apparent.
Diagram 90 visually illustrates the
legend shared by Tedlock's teacher
Andres Xiloj, that of the Hawk dropping
the Cross into the ocean. While Swain
son's hawks are migrating south over¬
head in late October and early Novem¬
ber, the Hawk constellation can be ob¬
served passing through the zenith just
after sunset. Throughout the night, the
Hawk-Cross combo moves westward, so
the Hawk appears to carry the Cross up
and over the sky. Before sunrise the Cross sets in the southwest and the Hawk sets
almost directly west. The Pacific Ocean lies to the southwest of Momostenango, so
the cosmic myth conforms to local geography. In this way, the Hawk is understood
to drop the Cross into the ocean. By December the Hawk sets at sunset and the
myth is no longer played out in the sky.
In charting the actual movements of this cosmic myth with astronomy soft¬
ware, I noticed that the dark-rift in the Milky Way connects the two constellations.
In the myth, the Hawk carries the Cross in its mouth. Ethno¬
graphic information identifies the dark-rift as a portal to the
Underworld, and related contexts suggest that the dark-rift
was also understood to be a mouth. Given the astronomy
thus far sketched, the mouth of the Hawk constellation must
be the dark-rift.
Based upon this association, we can deduce that the cos¬
mic mouth is also a source for rain in the myth. When the
Hawk carries the Cross into the center of the sky, rains come.
In the Popol Vuh, Huracan, also known as Heart of Sky, de¬
stroys a previous World Age when he sends a flood down upon
the Earth. A famous scene in the Maya Dresden Codex shows
a universal deluge pouring out of a deity's mouth.
Heroes of Maya myth often journey to Xibalba (the Maya
Diagram 90. A Hawk, a Cross, and a Mouth:
dark-rift as mouth



170/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
Underworld) to wage war on its evil denizens. In the Popol Vuh, One Hunahpu and
Seven Hunahpu journeyed to the Underworld and when they come to a crossroads,
they must choose the correct road. Of the four roads they encountered, only the
Black Road spoke to them, saying, "I am the one you are taking. I am the lord s
road."3 They ended up choosing this Black Road, which is another name for the
xibalba be—the dark-rift in the Milky Way.4 The point here is that the Black Road
spoke—it either has or is a mouth—which contributes to the veracity of our identi¬
fication of the Hawk's mouth with the dark-rift. From this and other Maya sources
we have examined, we know that the portal to the Underworld could be envisioned
in many ways: It was at least a road and a mouth (and elsewhere it might be a
temple door, a birthing passage, or something else). If we entertain the possibility
that the dark-rift in the Milky Way was the unchanging celestial core of this
many-faceted mythic structure, then we may find many mythic journeys to the
Underworld involving different metaphors, but all referring to the astronomical
fact of the dark-rift in Sagittarius.
Carvings and images from all over Mesoamerica show a warrior or king emerg¬
ing from the mouth of a deity monster. This "monster" is sometimes birdlike,
though sometimes it resembles a toad or a crocodile. Here, too, we have many
mythic transformations and parallel metaphors being expressed. Symbolically, they
are all equivalent and refer to the Milky Way. The underlying "fact"—the founda¬
tion of the mythic transformations—is the eternally recurring astronomical move¬
ment of the Milky Way and the dark-rift observable throughout the year.
The mouth of the Hawk constellation appears to be the background "mouth"
suggested by the dark-rift, but the ethnographers who collected the Quiche myth of
"The Hawk and the Cross" did not report that it contains an implicit reference to
the Milky Way's dark-rift, an astronomical feature that plays an important role in
Quiche mythology, Mesoamerican cosmology in general, and the alignment of the
Long Count end-date.
THE HOLE INTHE SKY, THE MOUTH OFTHE MONSTER
Other Maya groups today preserve myths and folktales that reflect concepts
in the Quiche myth of the Hawk and the Cross. This parallelism suggests that
there is a common basis for these stories, that each reflects a common, ancient
cosmovision. By exploring several of these stories, we can get to the heart of their



A HAWK, A CROSS, AND A MOUTH / 171
mythic structures and learn how to cross-compare their diverse mytho-astronomical
metaphors.
In one Chorti Maya folktale that resembles "The Hawk and the Cross/' a frog
wants to see the world from the sky. A bird takes him up in its mouth, high into the
sky. But then the frog is dropped and falls back to Earth, getting flattened upon
impact.5 Here, as in the Quiche tale, a bird carries an object into the sky, and then
drops it. However, the objects the bird carries are different: The Quiche cross has
been replaced with the Chorti frog. Sky-Earth polarity is
present in both stories, for each contains an ascending
stage and a descending, or dropping, stage.
But how are the cross and the frog metaphors related?
In Mesoamerican art, frogs are sometimes depicted
head-on, with the arms and legs forming the Kan-Cross
symbol.
The frog's mouth serves as the central or fifth direc¬
tion. The Chorti story may refer to the same astronomy
as the Quiche myth—in this case, the frog's mouth is the
dark-rift (the hole in the center of the cosmos), and the
frog's arms and legs are the four directions formed by the
Milky Way/ecliptic cross. The four-cornered frog thus rep¬
resents the four-directional celestial grid centered on the
crossing point of the Milky Way and ecliptic in Sagittarius, which has been identi¬
fied by Dennis Tedlock as the "four junction roads," i.e., the celestial crossroads.6
In both of these myths, the Earth and the sky are connected through the as¬
cending-descending movement of the frog, the cross, and the bird, and these mythic
symbols are thus at home in both realms. This dual-nature motif is a common
feature of Mesoamerican religious imagery. As one scholar put it, "Supernaturals
have many characteristics, one of which is bilocality ... the most important deities
are located in both earth and sky."7 In Mesoamerican thought, the realms of Earth
and sky operate together, following the same cycles. The ascending and descending
process in these myths suggests that time is an important facet of both realms.
Furthermore, distinct up and down movements of stars are a characteristic of the
Tropics, whereas at middle and northern latitudes stellar movements appear to
move in a circular way, revolving around the North Celestial Pole. These myths
thus accurately reflect the steep rise and set motions of stars as viewed within the
Diagram 92. Monument 9
from Chalcatzingo. Frog as

as fifth direction



172 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2 012
Tropics. In Mesoamerica, to the extent that time concepts are derived from sky
observations, time is more like a roller coaster than a merry-go-round.
On sculpture from the Pacific Coast of Guatemala and Chiapas, archaeologists
have found many images of birds holding a round object in their mouths. This
object is probably a corn seed, which symbolizes the sun.
The bird is usually depicted in flight.
The sun and the cross motifs are directly related in
Mesoamerican art and writing. For example, the ubiqui¬
tous Kan-Cross glyph denotes the sun in many contexts.
The Ahau ruler is a solar deity, and therefore is an ava¬
tar of the sun. In the religious beliefs of the Maya from
highland Chiapas, crosses are symbolic meeting points
between this world and the realm of the dead. In other
words, they are nexus points bridging the Underworld
and the sky. Like the xibalba be, they are doorways to
another world. And human beings, having two arms and
two legs, are four-directional symbols incarnate, just like
the frog. It is well-known that the macaw represents the
sun, and in many early Maya images, the bird holds a human figure, probably an
Ahau Lord, in its mouth. These carvings probably depict some form of the Hero
Twin myth, and thus the lords shown may be Hunahpu or Xbalanque. In any case,
these heroes, and all political Ahau (or chiefs), are representatives of the sun. In
fact, Hunahpu becomes the sun at the end of the Popol Vuh,8 We can formalize the
relational transformation of these symbols as follows: Cross:Frog-Bird:Sun:Ahau
Lord. The frog, with its two arms and two legs, is a cross symbol. The sun is por¬
trayed as a cross in Mesoamerican art, and the Ahau Lord is enthroned on the cross
situated at the boundary between the Upper and Lower worlds. This "formula"
explains how human beings, with their four arms and legs, are symbols of the Sa¬
cred Cross centered upon the dark-rift.9
In looking at these various cross forms, we are concerned with identifying
metaphorical parallels. Since myth and metaphor often decribe astronomical
events, we can build a cross-comparative database of astronomical road maps.
Although it is difficult to reconstruct any developmental continuity in these rep¬
resentations, or describe the rationale of how these symbols are related, we can
draw reasonable visual analogies. For example, the four-legged frog is like the
Diagram 93. a) Monument
17, Cotzumalhuapa, b) Altar
20, Izapa, c) Head-in-moutb
from El Baul



A HAWK, A CROSS, AND A MOUTH / 173
solar lord, who has two arms and two legs,- clearly, both symbolize the
four-directional cosmos. It is this kind of analogy-based thinking that allows us to
acknowledge how these symbols can vary tremendously yet still refer to the same
astronomical phenomenon.
Linguistics also can reveal parallels and broaden our understanding of how
mythological concepts are related. For example, in the Chortl material an oft-repeated
term is hoi txan. This is related to the Yucatec Maya phrase hoi can be, the "hole in
the middle of four roads." As Maya scholar J. Eric S. Thompson wrote, "Hoi can be
is an expression in the Books of Chilam Balam. Roys considered it to mean the
opening (hoi) between the four roads, the crossroads (can be)."10 Kan or chan means
four, sky, and/or serpent, and be means road. In other words, the hoi can be is
symbolically equivalent to the mouth of the frog, the hole where the four roads
meet, the central fifth direction, the center from which the Maya cosmos emanates
and from which Creation occurs.11 This is about as clear a picture as we can get, and
has exciting implications for our decoding of the astronomy in these myths. Hawks,
crosses, and mouths point right at the crossroads in Sagittarius, exactly where we
find the dark-rift "hole" or "mouth" known as the xibalba be.
As mentioned, hoi txan refers to the same concept as hoi can be. We can look
at how this term is used in the Chortl myths collected by ethnographer John Fought.
The first occurrence of hoi txan in Fought's book is in the folktale called "Belief in
Diviners." During a divination for the cause of illness, the speaker says, "Perhaps
it just came. Perhaps it was sickening winds, perhaps it was winds over the peaks,
it may have been Hoi Txan winds, or Hoi Txan clouds over the peaks. Perhaps it
was hovering clouds, perhaps it was Old Angels over the peaks."12 Here, hoi txan
seems to be associated with something over the peaks, 'Old Angels/ which prob¬
ably means pre-Hispanic deities. The speaker continues, "Perhaps it [hoi txan] is
the Great Royal Temple, the Great Major Temple. Perhaps it is the hole where
chilate is poured? [The hole where the ceremonial offering of chilate was poured
symbolized the center of the Earth, the Earth's 'mouth'.] Perhaps our Holy Mother
has joined up with the Hoi Txan."13 The story continues in this fashion with the
diviner, searching for the cause of illness, reciting a litany of symbolic associa¬
tions. For certain, mystery surrounds this hoi txan concept, and the failure of Chortl
storytellers to pin down the meaning of this term does not necessarily mean they
did not know what it meant. We read elsewhere that txih txan means "serpent" in
Chortl. This term is similar to its Yucatec counterpart chic chan, and Chicchan is



174/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
the Yucatec day-sign that means serpent. This linguistic association reveals that
the Chorti "tx" replaces the Yucatec "ch" (this is really a question of orthography;
the spelling of the words is different but the sounds are identical). As mentioned,
chan or can means four, sky, and serpent. Thus, hoi txan seems to mean exactly the
same thing as hoi can be. Another Chorti story implies that the hoi txan is a source
of wind, which suggests a "hole" in the sky through which winds pour—a univer¬
sal mythological motif.
In the story called "Curing," we are told: "Truly, you are the Kings of death
... of disease ... you seek [or search] the Silent Day [the night sky], the silent hour14
so as to transform yourselves, to Hoi Txan over mankind, since your waking is like
a thief's presence_"15 Transformation, a Silent Day, a thief—here we have com¬
pelling and familiar motifs. In this last passage, the term hoi txan is used as a verb,
suggesting something like "to rule over," reinforcing the image of a king or a head
chief enthroned in the cosmic center. In this light, the earlier mention of "Our
Holy Mother" joining up with the hoi txan is very suggestive. If the Holy Mother is
a reference to the overarching cosmos (the Milky Way), then the topmost head
chief (the sun) joining with the Milky Way describes a familiar astronomical sce¬
nario. And remember, in the ceremonial houses of the Yucatec Maya, the hoi can
be is at the very top, at the center of the symbolic cosmos. Elsewhere, Fought re¬
lates that his Chorti informant provided a folk etymology for the term hoi txan,
saying it is "like a rainbow."16 Among the Chorti, rainbows are associated with the
Milky Way because they both arch through sky, and—significantly—the Milky Way
is prominent during the time of year when the rains come. Rains, and the croaking
frogs that call them, are also associated with the nurturing fertility goddess, the
Earth Mother. And the Milky Way, being a part of the four-directional map, is asso¬
ciated with the four color directions (primary rainbow colors).
Finally, there is a little known hoi txan ceremony that is performed in secret
by a man and a woman near a pit or hole in the ground that contains candles.
According to Fought's informant, "They expose their genitals, fill in the pit, and
thereby put a spell on someone."17 Here we have the image of sexual union of male
and female over the earth-pit, or perhaps a late variant of an ancient rite involving
bloodletting from the genitals. Or, this may be a more generic shamanic technique.
(Dennis Tedlock writes of a Quiche shaman who advised that a man and a woman
seeking his counsel should wear the same shirt for a while, and then he would bury
it in order to cure their incessant quarreling.18) Overall, the meanings of hoi txan



A HAWK, A CROSS, AND A MOUTH / 175
and hoi can be operate in parallel and enrich our original reading of the Quiche
story of "The Hawk and the Cross."
The term hoi is found in many Maya languages, and generally means "head,"
as in chief or "topmost." We should remember that in Mesoamerican politics,
"chiefs" or kings were enthroned in the center of the world, a cosmic center that
has both terrestrial and celestial aspects; the king is the axis mundi uniting all
levels. In the Maya village of Santa Eulalia in the western highlands of Guatemala,
Holom Wits (head or chief mountain) was the name of one of the four crosses erected
at the directional pathways out of town. In the same town, people worshiped an
idol called Holom Konop, who was the symbolic head of the village. In the 1920s a
controversial political intrigue took place around this figure: It was stolen by people
who were against the ancient ways, but eventually it was recovered.19 This Holom
Konop deity is a modern variant of the ancient Mam, the year-bearer. Holom Konop
also appears to be associated with the Earth Lord, the dueno del mundo, the "Earth
owner." In the 1920s, ethnographers reported a cave ceremony near Santa Eulalia
that involved welcoming in the new year-bearer (the Mam), and during the rites the
Holom Konop icon was on the floor of the cave.20 Oliver LaFarge, the ethnographer
who visited Santa Eulalia, suggested this deity had a secret function when he wrote
that the town shrine dedicated to Holom Konop "receives much attention from the
Prayermakers but very little from the ordinary people, perhaps because of the ex¬
tremely esoteric nature of the Holom Konop."21
Recent ethnographic work in the Yucatan22 identifies the u hoi glorya as the
topmost and central level in the huts built for ceremonial rites (Linda Scheie calls it
the Glory Hole). These huts are made with four lashed poles (the four directions),
tied together at the top. The top thus represents the crossing point, and hung from
this central "hole" are religious ropes or cords. As Karl Taube put it, the u hoi
glorya is "a cosmic hole or conduit in the center and zenith of the sky."23 It is a hole
in the center of the crossroads, like the mouth of the frog or the mouth of the Hawk
that carries the Thieves' Cross. Again, these mouths and cosmic holes symbolize
the dark-rift in the Milky Way. Interestingly, the Chorti and Yucatec Maya share
the ceremonial practice of erecting symbolic houses of lashed poles that are tied
together at the top.24
Whether it be the hoi can be, the u hoi glorya, Holom Konop, or hoi txan, the
common thread in all of these phrases is the word hoi. In one of those strange
linguistic parallels, the Mesoamerican word-concept hoi not only sounds like but



176 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 7012
also means "hole/' But related meanings include "topmost" or "chief" and "con¬
duit." This topmost conduit or offering hole occurs in relation to sacrifice rituals,
the chief year-bearer, and is located at the center of the four-cornered cosmic house.
The astronomical reference should now be clear. While one location for the offer¬
ing "hoi" could be, as in the Yucatec model, the zenith, another location could be
the dark-rift "hole," that is, the center of the Milky Way/ecliptic cross near Sagit¬
tarius. Whether it be the zenith center or the Galactic Center, the point is that a
dark mystery, the mouth of a monster, lurks within the cosmic center.25 What this
mystery is will become clear when we gaze more deeply into the Galactic Center.
Susan Milbrath provided an important additional discussion of the cosmic cross¬
roads recognized by the Chorti Maya, having determined that this is none other
than the cross formed by the Milky Way and the ecliptic. She wrote that the mod¬
ern survival of the indigenous "Day of the Cross" festival (May 3) is a blend of
zenith sun worship directly related to honoring the Milky Way/ecliptic cross, be¬
cause "it celebrates in thought the zenith position of the sun in conjunction with
the Pleiades."26 She also noted an association between the modern Day of the Cross,
the arrival of the rains, and the solar zenith passage in May.27
The Chorti Maya considered the center of the Milky Way/ecliptic cross to be
"the heart of heaven and earth associated with the navel of the world and the mythic
ceiba tree."28 Being the center of heaven and Earth, the crossing point is thus the
celestial marker of an axis that actually extends down from heaven to the center of
the Earth. Milbrath encountered and clarified the confusion between the polar cen¬
ter and the zenith-as-center concept,29 a confusion that results from Hunrakan (Heart
of Heaven) sometimes being associated with the polar region. However, ethnogra¬
pher Raphael Girard, working among the Chorti, also associated the central world
axis of the ceiba tree with the zenith.301 feel that this conflict can be solved when
we accept that Maya cosmology was very complex, and the Maya recognized both
the zenith center and the polar center. Myths of a high deity of the cosmic center
(such as Hunrakan) apply equally well to both. Furthermore, the mytho-astronomical
motifs we have examined clearly indicate a third cosmic center, the Galactic Cen¬
ter. Remember, the Chorti Maya considered the center of the Milky Way/ecliptic
cross to be the "heart of heaven and earth," indicating the Galactic Center as the
centerpiece to this cosmogonic myth-map. Based upon my synthesis of the corpus
of academic studies already completed, my conclusions are reasonable and even
self-evident.31



A HAWK, A CROSS, AND A MOUTH / 177
More symbolic associations can be added to this metaphorical schema. On
some Classic Maya stelae, kings hold the double-headed serpent bar at a slight
angle. As mentioned earlier, the double-headed serpent
bar is now understood by scholars to symbolize the eclip¬
tic path of the sun and the planets.
According to Barbara Tedlock's ethnographic infor¬
mation, the sky-cross is described as "inclined to the
left," an apt description of both the Thieves' Cross con¬
stellation and the nearby Milky Way/ecliptic cross. In
the diagram, the ruler's body is the Milky Way, and the
double-headed serpent bar of rulership is the ecliptic
(probably assuming the place of his outstretched arms).
The center of this crossroads incarnate is the human
heart, the highest sacrificial offering in Mesoamerican
ritual. In this example, the sacred ruler does not just sit
on the throne symbolizing the cosmic center and cross¬
roads,- instead, he is the crossroads. And how is the king
a cross? We saw earlier how the physical body forms a
cross, but there are two other considerations: The sun
is symbolized by the cross, and sacred rulers are Ahau
Lords, representatives of the solar force. Thus, we have
a king-sun-cross association. Most interestingly, we have
seen that crosses are still recognized by Maya groups as doorways or portals to the
Underworld, the realm of the ancestors and supernaturals. Maya kings were not
just political leaders, but were spiritual leaders as well—king and shaman—and
one of their shamanic roles was to mediate knowledge flowing between this world
and other realms. The king-shaman had a foot in both worlds; he bridged realms
and was, literally, a doorway between worlds. He was one of the topmost chiefs, or
Holom Konops, who reside in the highest cosmic seat—the center of the cosmic
cross.
We have reviewed a number of symbolic forms and metaphor-complexes as
they appear in Maya folklore and linguistics. We cannot be sure how many of these
mythic inflections were intended or recognized by the Maya, but knowing the Maya
penchant for word play, analogy, and metaphor, it would not be surprising if every¬
thing we have discussed was considered to be, at one time or another, a legitimate

mythic transformation. The astronomical phenomena we have examined have
multiple representations in Maya myth, revealing a continuity of underlying mean¬
ing that suggests a type of metaphoric parallelism or conservation of referential
core. In other words, because the sources for these mythic concepts are found in the
sky, we can identify similarities between the different mythic forms assumed by
these astronomical features, as shown in the following table:

This careful scrutiny of parallels between mythological motifs can be applied
to many folktales. We have looked at several examples, considered linguistic and
ethnographic data, and found a common thread running through them all. But I
have saved the best for last. In the next chapter we will examine the modern Maya
folktale called “The Man Who Was Swallowed by an Alligator," which sheds new
light on how certain episodes in the Hero Twin myth were long ago conceived in
unexpected yet understandable ways, and became transformed after the Conquest.
Ultimately, we once again find compelling evidence for a complex and sophisti¬
cated cosmological science that survives within a fragmented, enigmatic folktale.



CHAPTER 15
THE MAN WHO WAS SWALLOWED
BY AN ALLIGATOR
he Quiche Maya folktale "The Man Who Was Swallowed by an Alligator" was
I recorded in the highlands of Guatemala in the 1970s. Told by F. Lucas Tepaz
Raxuleu of Santa Catarina Ixtahuacan, it was collected and translated by William
Norman at the Proyecto Linguistico Francisco Marroquin in Antigua, Guatemala.1
The legend clearly retains certain themes found in the Quiche Popol Vuh, which
was recorded in the 1550s. Episodes and characters from the Popol Vuh, as well as
unrecognizable scenarios involving the same characters, are found on ancient monu¬
ments at the Pre-Classic site of Izapa (400 b.c.-a.d. 100). Not surprisingly, given this
long time span, although these three legends share a similar theme, some of their
metaphors are different.
The earliest version of the Quiche Creation myth, identifiable at Izapa, con¬
tains motifs not found in the Quiche version but that are present in the modern tale.
In the study of epic poetry, redactions (variant versions) often clarify what is really
being talked about in the "standard" version. Thus, although a story and its telling
may stretch over thousands of years, its transformations and the introduction of
new metaphors can be charted. In addition, the modern story may preserve ele¬
ments from the oldest version that interim versions do not. In addition to ancient
associations, post-Conquest influences also are present in our modern story. In es¬
sence, what we have is an abridged version of the Popol Vuh, revealing alternate
thematic metaphors that enhance our understanding of the Maya use of symbol.
The modern redaction will add to our ability to cross-compare different metaphors,
identify their common meanings, and clarify the astronomical content of Maya myth.
Santa Catarina Ixtahuacan, where our story was recorded, is about seven kilo

meters south of the Pan-American highway in the western highlands of Guate¬
mala. As the crow flies, it is about fourteen kilometers northwest of Lake Atitlan.
The town and the text are Quiche Maya. I have decided to retell the story in my
own words, following William Norman's translation. The central events in the story
are as follows:
• a man goes to another world
• he meets hostile strangers
• he tricks them, injures them, and escapes
• he returns home with something new
Already we see similarities to the Popol Vuh, where the Hero Twins travel to
the Underworld, meet with the bizarre Xibalban Lords, trick them, kill them, and
return home. The new thing they bring back or bring about is the dawn of the next
World Age. Our folktale is filled with humor, so typical of Quiche narratives. Though
entertaining and amusing, the story contains important information about ancient
shamanism and the practice of undertaking vision journeys to "the other side."
A man goes to another world. They say that there once was a man who left
this world and traveled to another one. The man was walking by the ocean, along
the edge of the ocean, when suddenly an alligator jumped out and swallowed him.2
The alligator returned to the ocean and went deep down to the bottom. Inside the
alligator, the man saw it was dark and said, "Where am I?" After several days,
maybe three, the alligator emerged onto a beach on the other side of the ocean. He
lay there, sunning himself by the edge of the ocean. Inside the alligator, the man
saw light coming through between the alligator's ribs and said, "Where am I, where
have I come to?" The sun was shining inside the alligator. The man had a pocket
knife with him, so he slowly lowered his hand into his pocket to retrieve it. Then
he slit open the ribs of the alligator at the spot where the light was shining through.
From that spot, he climbed out of the alligator. Immediately he knew he was in
another world, on the other side of the ocean. The man had crossed over to the
other side of the ocean. When he emerged from the alligator he said, "Where have I
come to, where am I?" He found himself in another world. And there he began to
walk alongside the ocean.
He meets hostile strangers. The man was quite hungry, since he had been in



THE MAN WHO WAS SWALLOWED BY AN ALLIGATOR / 181
side the alligator for a long time. The alligator had been several days underneath
the ocean. It had been several days since the man had eaten so he was very hungry.
As he walked along the edge of the ocean he saw a cornfield. He was so hungry
he ran into the cornfield to pick an ear of corn, but it started yelling and screaming.
So the owners of the cornfield came running out to the field. The owners were
Moors; they say that the people who live in the other world are Moors. They came
running to see what was going on in their cornfield. When they arrived, they found
the man in their field. The Moors demanded, "What are you doing there, what are
you doing to our corn?"
The man said to the Moors, "I'm very hungry because I haven't eaten for sev¬
eral days."
The Moors replied, "Why have you come here, and where are you from?"
So the man explained what had happened to him. "I am from another world. I
was walking by the edge of the ocean. An alligator came out and swallowed me up,
went back into the ocean and came out here. When he sunned himself on the shore,
I saw the light inside the alligator, so I slit open his ribs with my knife. That's how
I got out of the alligator, that's how I got here to this world. And so I am now very
hungry, I haven't eaten."
And the Moors replied, "But what do you want with our cornfield? Why do
you want to hurt our corn?"
"As I said, I am very hungry. In our town we eat. We make food from the dried
ears of corn, or we roast the green ears of corn, and we eat them."
The Moors were very astonished, and asked, "Why do you eat?"
The man said, "We, we eat corn."
"So is the corn good for eating?" the Moors asked.
"Yes, yes, it's good to eat, that's why we eat it. Don't you eat it?"
The Moors said, "No, we don't eat the corn, we just smell it and get full that
way."
The man replied, "It's not like that with us. We eat corn, we eat food, we eat all
kinds of edible things: bread, meat, fruit, and all sorts of things."
And the Moors say,3 "Why do you eat? We don't eat like that, we don't eat
corn, it's the smell of the corn that makes us full. That's how we get full. How do
you manage it? Is there then someplace for it to come out?"
He tricks them, injures them, and escapes. And the man thought and said,



182 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
"Well, yes there is, because we had our anuses perforated. First it's slit with a knife,
and then it's pierced with a poker. Then when we squat, out of the hole comes our
excrement. We can eat all types of things."
The Moors say, "Oh, okay. But we aren't like that, we don't eat, we can just
smell the food and get full, always."
So the Moors gave permission to the man to pick some of the corn. He roasted
it over a fire and ate it right in front of them. The Moors were amazed. After the
man had finished eating the corn, he squatted in front of them. They were quite
amazed at the man when he squatted. The man said, "See, I eat things and they
come out. If we could find a way, you could eat too. Haven't you done anything to
your anuses? If you want, we could find a way to perforate yours like we do in my
town. There, we have all been perforated. Then you could do like us, you could eat
all kinds of foods."
"Yes, we want to eat," said the Moors, "but we don't have anuses, there's no
place for it to come out."
"Well," the man said, "You saw me eating and it came out. I'm not just lying
to you." "Oh, yes," the Moors replied, and they were completely fooled by the
man. "Could you perforate us?"
And the man said, "Well. . . maybe, if. .."
"Please," exclaimed the Moors, "please, do us the favor, perforate ours."
"All right," said the man. "Do you have a poker I could use to perforate your
anuses?"
"Yes, we do," the Moors replied, and they found a poker and gave it to him.
The man sharpened the poker and then put it in the fire to make it hot. "Bend
over," he said to the Moors. And since they wanted to eat all kinds of food, they
said, "All right." So the man began to perforate the Moors, inserting the hot poker
between their buttocks. He perforated one of the important Moors, the Moors'
Father. The man thought of something while he did this. "Oh no," said the man, "I
didn't bring any medicine." The important Moor whom he had just perforated said,
"Oh! I'm dying of pain! What am I going to do?"
"I have some medicine at home," the man said, "but I didn't bring it. You
know how I got here, inside an alligator, so I couldn't bring any medicine, it's in my
home town."
The Moors say, "If only there were some way we could get your medicine back
here from your town."



THE MAN WHO WAS SWALLOWED BY AN ALLIGATOR / 183
"If only someone would go get it," said the man.
"If only there were something we could use to stop the pain," say the Moors.
One Moor wonders, "Who could we find to go with you to bring back the
medicine?"
"I don't know," said the man. "My medicine at home doesn't even make a
scar, it just stops the pain once and for all, and forms a hole."
And they all say to him, "Then we better find you a horse right away, because
we need the medicine now. Please hurry. There is the Ma'ts, and he'll be a good
horse for you, you can ride on his back."
The horse they call Ma'ts is really a deer. The Moors went and asked the Ma'ts
for the favor. They said, "If you are willing, please do us a big favor. Go on a trip."
The horse asked, "Where?"
"Across the ocean to another world; carry the man to get his medicine. He
perforated several men and they are dying of pain. We need the medicine now."
"Oh, of course," said the Ma'ts, "certainly I'll go, that's fine."
So the Ma'ts went with them. The Moors said to the man, "This is Ma'ts. He
will be your horse, you can ride on his back." The man said, "Fine," and mounted
Ma'ts. Then they went out on top of the ocean. They were well out over the ocean
when the Moors started yelling to Ma'ts, saying, "Ma'ts, come back, our Father is
dying! Come back right away, we say! Ma'ts! Our Father is dying." But Ma'ts couldn't
hear them, since he was running at top speed on top of the ocean. He asked the man
what the Moors were saying. The man said, "They say, hurry up, go faster!" "All
right," said Ma'ts, and he ran on top of the ocean. He hurried along on his way on
top of the ocean. They crossed over the ocean, they crossed over into this world. If
Ma'ts had heard them yelling for him to come back, he would have gone back right
away. Since he couldn't hear them clearly, he asked the man he carried what they
were saying. But the man didn't tell the truth, since he knew that the men he had
perforated were dying. So he just told Ma'ts that they said to hurry up. If Ma'ts
knew, he would have gone back and the man would be killed. The man knew what
was really going on, so he didn't tell Ma'ts. He didn't have any medicine, he had just
tricked them. That is why he didn't want to return.
He returns home with something new. The man and Ma'ts crossed over. The
man said, "Thank you for carrying me across the ocean, you brought me all the way
back to my town. I am home. Whether or not you go back, it doesn't matter. I've



184/ MAYA COSMOG E N E 5 I 5 2012
won. I crossed back over to this side. Thank you. I'm not going." If the man re¬
turned among the Moors, he would be killed immediately. Because he had perfo¬
rated the Moors but didn't return, they must have all died of pain. That's all that
happened. He didn't return with any medicine, he just fooled them. And he defi¬
nitely came back to his home town.
Now, as for Ma'ts, if he returned he would certainly be killed too. He decided
he would not go back, and stayed here for good. That is how the deer arrived in this
world long ago. They say that there used to be no deer here, that they were with the
Moors in another world. The man rode the deer here when he came back over the
ocean,- that was how he crossed over.
This is how it happened. First, the man was swallowed by an alligator. Then he
was spewn up by the alligator.4 Next, he perforated the Moors, and finally, he used
a deer to ride back over the ocean. According to our Mother-Fathers, that is what
happened to the man, a long time ago.
METAPHORS AND MEANINGS
This story contains metaphors found in other world myths. For example, a
man traveling to another world recalls the shamanic journey to the Underworld.
The belly of the sea monster (the Jonas/whale motif) is a common symbol of the
center of the cosmos, and partakes of universal or archetypal themes in the hero's
quest. In Siberian shamanistic vision rites, the goal was to enter another realm
through the Pole Star. In many mythic narratives, the sky is likened to the ocean,
the mirroring of sky and Earth is thus emphasized through this parallel between
opposite categories.
In our folktale, the alligator is the vehicle of travel to the Underworld. To
Mesoamerican shamans, the caiman was a totemib spirit companion aiding in divi¬
nation and Otherworld journeys. After going to "the bottom of the sea" (i.e., the
top of the sky) and being gone for about three days, seeker and vehicle arrive in the
Otherworld. There, the seeker cuts open his vehicle, meaning that he cannot re¬
turn by the same way. Two other meanings are present here: Emerging from inside
the alligator is a symbolic rebirth, and cutting the alligator open with a knife re¬
calls the deity sacrifice necessary for Mesoamerican cosmogenesis. A new world is
found (or manifests) and the cause or vehicle of that manifestation (the alligator)
must be sacrificed to complete the world's "birth". This is similar to the Western



philosophical concept of Emanationism, wherein the One God must fragment It¬
self to manifest in the multiplicity of beings which comprise Its creation. Signifi¬
cantly, just prior to the man's "birth," the sun shines in the alligator's stomach.
The inference here is that the sun is in the alligator. But the man is really what is
inside of the alligator, suggesting that he is really a solar hero, representing the sun.
We should recall here that the alligator (the "cosmic monster") is the Milky Way,
and its mouth is the dark-rift. If this astronomical symbolism is accurate, the mean¬
ing is that the sun (the solar hero) is "in" the dark-rift (the alligator's mouth) at the
moment of cosmogenesis, which describes the Galactic Alignment on the Long
Count end-date in a.d. 2012.
Now the real adventure begins. The man asks "Where am I?" but this is not
just a casual question. This, I believe, is really intended as a hint for the audience.
The sense is that one must consider this event very carefully, for perhaps some¬
thing more profound is hidden here. Where is this "other world"? Is it the Xibalban
Underworld of the ancient Maya? Is it the strange homeland of the Spaniards (the
Moors), across the ocean? Or both at the same time? This multilayered technique
of storytelling makes the listener perk up and think more deeply. And the state¬
ment is repeated three times even before the strange aliens are encountered. In this
inevitable encounter, the question is answered. Yes, he has arrived in the ancient
Maya Underworld. However, the Lords of Xibalba are now the Spanish foreigners
who follow strange customs. Likewise, in the Popol Vuh, the Hero Twins journey
to Xibalba and confront the Dark Lords of the Underworld. The Twins were sum¬
moned because of their loud ballplaying, which disturbed the Lords. The Meso
american ballgame is replete with corn-god symbolism, and in our folktale the yell¬
ing of the corn arouses the "Moors". And initially they are hostile.
The wily man thinks of a way he can trick these strangers when he discovers
that they do not eat food. They do not eat the way humans do; they get full by just
smelling the corn. In Maya ceremonies, incense is burned as offerings to the ances¬
tors who live in Xibalba and to "feed" the beings living in other realms. And this
practice is of great interest to the modern Tzutujil and Quiche, who maintain the
world by feeding deities with incense offerings, a sacred fragrance and a subtle food.
The point here is that the ancestors and other denizens of the Underworld live on
the fragrance of incense offerings. Thus, the Moors, on one level, are quite clearly
equated with the denizens of the ancient Maya Underworld, the Lords of Xibalba.
At the same time, they are in fact called Moors, which is a diplomatically indirect



186/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
way that Indians have of referring to their Spanish overlords. And, like the Lords of
Xibalba, the Spaniards/Moors are strange and, quite frankly, evil. They follow strange
customs—they don't even have anuses!
Here the story takes on a kind of reverse moralism, tempered with a mocking
bit of vengeance. With veiled symbolism, the Quiche story offers to teach a lesson
by giving the Moors a dose of their own medicine. The Indian experience in Guate¬
mala has been one of torture and genocide, Janus-faced social policies in the name
of good intentions. A foreign world with strange customs was foisted upon them,
and there was no follow-up by the Moors when things did not turn out as promised.
The "hot poker" evokes metal rods and Spanish branding tools (tools of torture), as
well as the pre-Hispanic stingray spines used in bloodletting. But overall, with char¬
acteristic mocking humor, the anus-perforating episode simply means, "Well, up
yours too!" As in the mocking Dance of the Conquistadors performed every year by
indigenous people in Guatemala, the roles are reversed to safely express the real
story. The lesson is: Do not force your evil ways on us without taking responsibil¬
ity for the effects of your actions—a sobering message indeed.
The man is clever, and pulls a fast one on the alien beings. In shamanic jour¬
neys, the journeyer must often deal quickly and effectively with entities met, and
the truly heroic sage not only comes back in one piece, but brings something back
with him. In the Popol Vuh, the Hero Twins encounter the bizarre Dark Lords,
overcome all their trials, and ultimately trick them with their clever magic. And
the metaphors are violent. The Hero Twins end up sacrificing the Lords of Xibalba
and do not revive them as promised. They did this to avenge the death of their
father, One Hunahpu. Their father was killed in Xibalba, and they tried to bring
him back after defeating the Lords. The Popol Vuh is strangely garbled at this point,
and does not match the successful resurrection of One Hunahpu as portrayed on
Classic-period ceramics and at Izapa. Again, the reason for this is that we are deal¬
ing with many versions of the Popol Vuh Creation myth, occurring through a two
thousand year history. Nevertheless, what we have preserved in our modern folktale
is the motif of reviving the ailing or dead father.
In the folktale, the theme of the dying father also is present, but strangely
reversed in that it is the Moors' Father whom they want to revive or save. They
sense that the deer is going for good, and it was believed that when the spirit com¬
panion (the nagual) departed, the person was sure to die. The Moors' Father was
probably thought of as a Mother-Father, that is, a head shaman.5 The totem spirit of



THE MAN WHO WAS SWALLOWED BY AN ALLIGATOR / 187
the head chief was stolen, a cause for great anxiety. Shamanic curing often involved
calling back the ill person's lost nagual, an animal spirit-companion that one is
attached to at birth. Likewise, an evil shaman could steal another person's nagual,
which would result in death.
Finally, the man of the folktale escapes back home, but not in the same way as
he came, for his earlier vehicle of transport was sacrificed. This represents a total
commitment to the journey. With his own wits, he must find a way back from the
alien realm. In other words, he must bring something back with him, a new knowl¬
edge symbolized by the deer. The deer is a sacred being to the Maya. Like the caiman,
the deer was a spirit ally of the shaman. Amazingly, this is also true for Siberian
shamans and their reindeer, a partnership that involves the visionary use of Amanita
muscaiia, a psychoactive mushroom. The deer was used like a horse to ride over
the ocean. Earlier, the alligator went "to the bottom of the ocean"; now, the deer
takes the man "over the top" of the ocean. This suggests a cyclic process of some
kind—of going and returning on the journey.
While the deer is indigenous to the Americas, the horse is not, but the two are
matched in the folktale. "They say that there used to be no deer here, that they
were with the Moors in another world." And it is true that the Spanish introduced
horses to the New World, which the Maya probably perceived as the Spaniard's
animal spirit companions. Indians adopted these as their own animal companions,
but the deer is the archetypal and shamanic basis of the relationship.
In the Popol Vuh, the Hero Twins "bring back" the dawn. Among some Maya,
the morning star apparition of Venus just before dawn is called the Deer Star.6 Fur¬
thermore, the day-sign Manik (Deer) is one of the four year-bearers of the 260-day
tzolkin calendar followed by the Quiche. The deer was and is very much a part of
Maya religion, calendrics, and cosmology.7
Archaeologist William Fash uncovered a Middle Classic tomb at Copan during
his excavation work. This elite burial contained a shaman who was treated with
great honor. His tomb contained many artifacts, including stingray spines, a hope¬
lessly deteriorated bark-paper codex, quartz stones, magnets, and the bones of his
animal spirit companions—a deer and a caiman. As related by Fash, the circum¬
stances of his discovery were bizarre. Several days after finding this amazing cache
of artifacts, including the bones of the shaman himself, Fash suffered a serious
injury that required surgery. The local people in the village of Copan were con¬
vinced it was caused by the shaman, and dubbed him El Brujo, The Warlock.8



188/ MAYA COSMOOENE5IS 2012
The shaman's tomb at Copan demonstrates that the deer and the caiman had a
specific meaning for the shaman. Perhaps one was used on the outgoing journey
(the caiman), while the other was used to return (the deer). This is what the folk¬
tale suggests. One of the artifacts found in this prestigious shaman's burial was a
bowl with a lifelike face carved on the handle, which Fash muses might be the
shaman himself.
The Quiche Maya people who preserved "The Man Who Was Swallowed by an
Alligator" may have come from Copan.9 Quiche migration accounts in the Popol
Vuh relate that they came from a "great eastern city" that used a bat as its emblem.
A bat is contained in the glyphic placename for Copan. As such, we might even
imagine that this Copan shaman is the man of our folktale. The heroic rider of
otherworldly deer and passenger in cosmic caiman, he and his story might have
been preserved for centuries. Overall, his life adventures were probably seen to fit
the pattern of the Hero Twins.
ASTRONOMICAL SYMBOLISM IN OUR FOLKTALE
This short but rich folktale provides many metaphors that we can compare to
similar motifs found elsewhere in Mesoamerica. In general, it seems that this folktale
creatively maps the events of the Conquest onto the ancient Hero Twin myth, and
preserves a very ancient context involving shamanic journeys. Shamanism is still a
central feature of Maya religion, clearly present in Quiche divination and ritual.
One metaphor present in the folktale is the alligator, and perhaps the single most
important metaphor in the folktale is the alligator's mouth, which is portrayed as a
portal, or vehicle of transport, to the Otherworld. The Quiche, as frequently noted,
equate the Underworld road with the dark-rift in the Milky Way. The same is true
of the mouth of the jaguar, which is another Earth deity, and jaguar-mouth symbol¬
ism is found on the oldest Mesoamerican carvings going back to the Olmec. As
such, I do not believe that the presence of the alligator-mouth metaphor in the
modern folktale is a recent innovation. Even though it is not present in the Popol
Vuh version, it is clearly ancient.10 On the other hand, one passage in the Popol Vuh
relates that the Black Road "spoke" to the Hero Twins, indicating that the dark-rift
was, in fact, thought of as a mouth.
Alligators' mouths and toads' mouths were important symbols at Izapa, where
the first representations of the Popol Vuh/Hero Twin myth are found. In the Popol



THE MAN WHO WAS SWALLOWED BY AN ALLIGATOR / 189
Vuh, the method of going to the Underworld is via the Black Road, the xibalba be.
I feel that the Black Road motif was a later replacement of the original mouth
symbol, perhaps appealing more to the Quiche mentality. However, the alligator
mouth and the Black Road both refer to the dark-rift in the Milky Way, which was
understood as the cosmic portal to the Underworld at the center of the celestial
Crossroads—the top and/or bottom of the "ocean." Considering the nature of the
alignment that occurs on the Long Count end-date, anything that elucidates the
mythical transformations of the dark-rift contributes to our understanding of Maya
cosmogenesis. "The Man Who Was Swallowed by an Alligator" is about the shaman's
journey into another world and his quest for new knowledge. As we know, Maya
kings undertook these arduous journeys themselves, often with the aid of
vision-producing plants and elixirs. They sat on their thrones, deep within the cer¬
emonial temple, and passed through dimensions of time and space known to only a
few. Mushrooms were a common plant used to alter consciousness, and archaeo¬
logical evidence demonstrates that a vigorous and widespread mushroom cult ex¬
isted in southern Mesoamerica when the Long Count and the Hero Twin myth
were being formulated. Consequently, shamanic tools of vision are keys to under¬
standing the context in which the Long Count was discovered. How did these sa¬
cred plants contribute to the Mesoamerican worldview? And how many different
types of vision-producing substances were there? It is time to enter deeper into the
world of the ancient shaman-astronomers, those intrepid cosmonauts who devised
the Galactic Cosmology of the Long Count end-date.

SHAMANICTOOLS, THRONES,
AND BIRTH PORTALS
T
he use of visionary substances in shamanistic rituals has a long history in
Mesoamerica. The archaeological record highlights a period between 600 b.c.
and a.d. 100, which corresponds to the development of Maya culture and calendrics,
during which visionary substances were used and revered on a large scale. The
development of the Long Count calendar took place during this Pre-Classic period,
and it just so happens that a vigorous mushroom cult existed in southern
Mesoamerica at this time.
MUSHROOMS IN THE MIST: AN ANCIENT PRESENCE
In the 1950s, pioneer mycologist Gordon Wasson discovered a surviving mush¬
room cult among the Mazatec Indians in Central Mexico.1 Evidence for
pre-Conquest use of mushrooms among the Mixtec and Mazatec comes from the
Codex Vindobonensis and other Central Mexican picture books, where mushroom
rites are depicted.2 The Mazatec Indians of Oaxaca still use psilocybin-containing
mushrooms, as well as other mind-altering substances such as Salvia divinorum
and Datura, commonly called Jimsonweed. Many other groups in Oaxaca, Veracruz,
and other areas of Mexico continue to use visionary plants. In southern
Mesoamerica, hundreds of miles southeast of the Mixtec domain, there is little
evidence that the Indians currently use entheogenic plants. Still, it is apparent
191



192/ MAYA C0SM06ENE5IS 2012
that a widespread mushroom religion once existed throughout
the highlands of Chiapas and Guatemala and their Pacific coastal
regions. For example, more than two hundred ceremonial "mush¬
room stones" and pottery effigies have been found throughout
the Izapa region.3
At Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala, a ceremonial cache of nine
mushroom stones was found in an elite tomb dated to roughly
750 b.c. They may represent the nine Lords of the Underworld,
and suggest that mushrooms were used by the elite ruling class.
This is not surprising, because kings were also high shamans, who
had the responsibility of communicating with the ancestors by
undertaking visionary journeys. In general, psychoactive mushrooms clearly played
an important role in the reli¬
gion and cosmology of the
pre-Maya people of highland
Guatemala and surrounding
areas.
Mycologists (fungi spe¬
cialists) recognize a distinct
difference between two psy¬
choactive mushroom species:
Amanita muscaiia and the psilocybin-containing mushrooms. The former contains
muscimole as a psychoactive compound, whereas the latter contains psilocybin,
which is considered to be the more powerful psychoactive. The Amanita muscaiia
mushroom (also known as the fly agaric) is distinctive in that its red caps usually
open wide and are topped with prominent white spots. Psilocybin mushrooms are
more rounded or bell-shaped and have smooth cap surfaces. The mushroom stones
in the diagram above most closely resemble the psilocybin-containing mushrooms.
In his translation of the Popol Vuh, Dennis Tedlock discusses references to
mushrooms, addressing an academic debate over whether Amanita or psilocybin
mushrooms were the ones used by Maya shamans.4 The reference to a mushroom
in the Popol Vuh may be a memory of the ancient mushroom religion in the high¬
lands, but was the religion based in psilocybe mushroom use or Amanita use? Maya
shamans were no doubt aware of both, as Amanita is still widely used today as an
inebriant by shamans in Asia, Siberia, and North America. None of the mushroom

SHAMANIC TOOLS, THRONES, AND BIRTH PORTALS / 193
stones resemble Amanita,5 but what appears to be an Amanita muscaria mush¬
room appears in a page from a Maya codex, shown below.
Although this evidence is persuasive, Amanita was probably not a favorite
among shamans because it is unreliable as a powerful entheogen and the quality of
its effects vary widely from region to region and from sea¬
son to season.
An argument against the presence, let alone the use,
of psilocybin mushrooms in pre-Conquest Mesoamerica
hinges upon an important requirement that psilocybin
mushrooms need in order to germinate. They are copro
philic, that is, they prefer to grow on the dung of ruminant
animals such as cattle. The problem is that cattle were
brought to the New World by the Spaniards. Anthropolo¬
gist Peter Furst addressed this problem, and offered a solu¬
tion: "The only animal that would seem to fit this prob¬
able requirement is also one that played an extraordinarily
prominent role in Mesoamerican belief—the deer."6 Many
species of deer, of course, are indigenous to the New World.
Symbolic and mythic associations between deer, the Un¬
derworld, and death are present in Maya religion. In fact,
the shaman in the Quiche Maya folktale "The Man Who
Was Swallowed by an Alligator" used a sacred deer to transport himself back home,
over the cosmic ocean. The association between deer and the otherworldly journey
inspired by mushroom use is significant. The deer is one of the most popular naguales
(animal spirit companions) claimed by Maya shamans. As Furst wrote, the deer was
probably seen "as the magical progenitor of the vision-producing mushroom."7 Based
upon these ideas, we can surmise that to "ride the deer" was a Mesoamerican meta¬
phor for mushroom intoxication, which in fact is the case among Siberian shamans
today. Overall, the argument that Amanita must have been the only psychoactive
mushroom used in ancient Mesoamerica because psilocybin species could not have
survived there prior to the arrival of Old World cattle is not well-founded.

In addition to mushrooms, many other mind-altering plant substances were



194/ MAYA COSMOG E N ES I S 2012
included in the ancient Mesoamerican pharmacopoeia of shamanic tools. Modern
Quiche diviners use the seeds of the coralbean palo de pita, which is of the species
erythrina,8 as divining tools when they count the days for clients, and bone setters
use the leaves of this plant to facilitate healing.9 Infusions prepared from the
coralbean are said to provide an effective sedative. It is not clear whether large
doses of infusions from this plant are psychoactive, or if special methods of prepa¬
ration would render it so. Bright red in color, the Maya call the coralbean seeds
tz’ite seeds, and, interestingly, they also served as markers in the Aztec board game
called Patolli. The coralbean's prominent standing in Quiche divination, being the
very markers with which the days are ritually counted, suggests a long association
with shamanism and magic.
Other shamanic vision techniques are quite bizarre, as evidenced by the tradi¬
tion of "vision quest through enema."10 By taking infusions of psychoactive sub¬
stances directly into the rectum, shamans could avoid the turbulence that these
brews sometimes inflict on the stomach.11 Depictions of enema jugs and the proce
_ dure itself are found on Mesoamerican ce¬
ramics and sculpture.
The enema ingredients included Balche
(mead fermented with the bark of the
Lonchocarpus tree), maguey, Datura, and to¬
bacco, and alcohol-based infusions may have
been mixed with hallucinogenic substances.
It is interesting to note that imagery associ¬
ated with the vision-enema includes a facial
expression dubbed "the howl." On one level,
this may be the expected reaction when
gourds are shoved in unaccustomed places, but it also suggests the singing and
chanting performed by South American shamans to induce specific states and ex¬
periences, much like the overtone singing used by Siberian shamans to create un¬
usual auditory and visionary phenomena.12 The "howl"
expression also resembles the Ahau day-sign glyph.
An endless array of psychoactive plants has been
identified recently by independent ethnobotanists doing
serious work in the field. Marlene Dobkin de Rios records „. ., , ,

may have used to enter altered states of consciousness.13 For example, the ubiqui¬
tous waterlily. An African representative of the waterlily genus is used as a nar¬
cotic among African tribes. The waterlily is often associated with death symbols in
Maya art, and the complex of beliefs associated with this motif is similar to those
connected with maize symbology. Many different types of entheogenic plants have
been found in modern-day Mesoamerica, but our interest is, again, on the context
in which the Long Count was invented. For this, we must focus again on the area of
Izapa, and its monuments. There, we find a preoccupation with toads and frogs.
Toads were sacred animal guides used by Mesoamerican shamans, and at Izapa
both frogs and toads were carved on altars. Not surprisingly, like the magical rela¬
tionship between deer and mushrooms, certain toads are the source of a
vision-producing substance—5-MeODMT, a derivative of dimethyltryptamine
(DMT), the most powerful hallucinogenic currently known.
THE PSYCHEDELIC BUFO MARINES TOAD
5-MeODMT is found in the “venom" of the North American toad species Bufo
marines. Underground literature by Albert Most explains how the venom can eas¬
ily be squeezed from this toad's parotid glands, dried, and smoked. However, this is
not to be confused with the foolish practice of “toad licking"—a very dangerous
thing to do. DMT also is present in the South American plant Psychotria viridis,
which, when mixed with the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibiter found in the
jungle vine Banisteriopsis caapi, yields the South American hallucinogen ayahuasca.
There are probably many plant sources of DMT in Mexico and Central America but
it needs to be combined with an MAO inhibiter to be orally active. Otherwise,
DMT from a plant source would need to be extracted and distilled so that it could
be smoked. The venom of Bufo marines provides a smokable form of DMT-derived
5-MeODMT that does not require much preparation apart from drying. Ethnologist
Timothy Knab received information from a curandero in Veracruz on how to pre¬
pare venom extracted from the Bufo toad to neutralize its more toxic effects.14 DMT
and 5-MeODMT are close chemical cousins, but the subjective effects and response
profiles are somewhat different. However, ethnographic and archaeological evidence
indicates that Mesoamerican shamans were very interested in the 5-MeODMT they
could extract from the Bufo marines toad, and depicted it as a vision-producing
substance.



196 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2 012
As mentioned, toads, like deer, were important totemic animals to ancient
Mesoamerican shamans. Peter Furst discusses the symbolism associated with toads
among the Olmec, specifically identifying the Bufo marines species as one the Olmec
found interesting. This toad species goes through an annual molting during which
the toad's skin is sucked into its mouth and eaten. As with skin-shedding snakes,
the ancient Mesoamericans perceived this process as a symbolic rebirth and re¬
newal. Bufo toads also have a distinct cleft in their foreheads, which Furst associ¬
ates with the cleft heads in Olmec art. By way of the shared cleft motif, the Sacred
Toad and the Mother Goddess are related. In fact, on one level of meaning, toads in
Izapan art represent the Milky Way Mother Goddess. Furst explored the relation¬
ship between the psychedelic properties of toad venom and the mythology of the
Hero Twins and the Toad-Jaguar-Grandmother.15 He also writes that "it is presum¬
ably the conceptualization of the Earth Mother as a devouring-regenerative mon¬
strous toad with jaguar characteristics that accounts for the monolithic toadlike
Zoomorph B at Quirigua, Altar A at Copan, and the toad altar at Izapa... ,"16 For the
Olmec, the prominent ritualistic and symbolic place occupied by the Bufo marines
toad suggests more than a casual admiration. Large quantities of Bufo bones were
found at San Lorenzo. Tobacco and smoking paraphernalia have been used by New
World Indians for thousands of years. If the Olmec knew how to extract the magic
venom from their toads, which they most certainly did, then they had the most
powerful psychoactive substance at their disposal. This tradition was no doubt shared
at Izapa. In fact, certain monuments at Izapa (for example, Stela 6) prove that Izapan
shamans used the Sacred Toad as a vehicle for otherworldly journeys into the cos¬
mic center. These toad monuments will provide a piece of the cosmic puzzle as we
explore, in Part IV, the Galactic Cosmology developed at Izapa.
NEW DIRECTIONS
Psychoactive mushrooms and other powerful mind-altering substances were
being used in the area of Mesoamerica that gave birth to the Long Count calendar.
This is an important factor to consider in explaining the rapid transformation from
the Olmec to the Maya culture, the rapid birth of a new cultural paradigm. A new
version of the old mythology sprang up at the same time—the Popol Vuh/Hero
Twin myth—and was first recorded on the monuments of Izapa. As discussed ear¬
lier, the Hero Twin myth is an esoteric World Age doctrine designed to describe and



SHAMANIC TOOLS, THRONES, AND BIRTH PORTALS / 197
explain, in mythic terms, the astronomical process by which the December sol¬
stice sun converges with the dark-rift in the Milky Way. The Long Count and the
Popol Vuh arose within a context in which powerful consciousness-enhancing sub¬
stances were being used. And the Long Count, we will remember, is designed to
end during a unique era of astronomical alignment pointing right at the Galactic
Center. Could the use of hallucinogens explain how the ancient skywatchers be¬
came aware of the Galactic Center? Is it just a coincidence that the Galactic Center
is near the crossroads believed by the Maya to be the place of World Age Creation?
Could the use of consciousness-enhancing drugs facilitate such awareness? Even
though our understanding of altered states of consciousness has improved in the
last thirty years, we still have no idea what the limits of knowledge gathered with
these visionary tools might be.
And, we must ask, what mysteries does the Galactic Center contain? Did the
Maya somehow access information or energies resident there? Does their cosmol¬
ogy reflect information obtained shamanically, intimations of a complexly inter¬
weaving multidimensional cosmos? The sheer profundity and nearly impenetrable
insights that are clearly present in Maya cosmology suggest this is so. Maya cos¬
mology is based in experiential insights derived from using shamanic tools of vi¬
sion, and to get an idea of the kind of worldviews that arise in cultures that use
these substances as viable sources of information about the nature of reality, we
can look to the cosmic models devised by hallucinogen-using Indians in South
America—the Desana, Warao, and Kogi.
PSYCHEDELIC COSMOLOGIES
The Desana, who live on the equator in the Vaupes Territory of the Northwest
Amazon, developed a complex geometrical cosmology. The founding myth of the
tribe, which explains how their equatorial homeland was chosen, involves a super¬
natural hero who searched for a place where his staff, when held upright, would not
cast a shadow. This is true for the equator on the equinoxes. The shamanic image of
this event is that of the staff as a ray of sunlight, a divine sperm, which fertilized
the earth. The guiding principle of the Desana thus is, as explained by ethnographer
Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff, a "search for the center," the "Center of Day."17
The Desana envision space as a great hexagon bounded by six stars centered
upon Epsilon Orionis, the middle star in Orion's belt. Desana shamans also per



198 / MAYA COSMOGENESI5 2012
ceive this six-sided shape in the structure of rock crystals and honeycombs. The
Milky Way is an important celestial dividing line for the Desana, and the entire
celestial vault is envisioned as a cosmic brain, divided into two lobes by the great
fissure of the Milky Way. According to Reichel-Dolmatoff, "The Desana believe
that both brains, the cosmic and the human, pulsate in synchrony with the rhythm
of the human heartbeat, linking Man inextricably to the Cosmos."18 Here we glimpse
profound cosmological concepts developed by the ayahuasca-using Desana. Despite
living simple lives as hunter-gatherers in the ever-dwindling jungles of the upper
Amazon, the Desana utilize shamanic tools of insight and vision to arrive at a
profound multidimensional model of the cosmos.
For the Warao Indians of Venezuela, the Earth is a flat disk floating in the
cosmic ocean. A "Snake of Being" resides in the outer sea encircling the earth. The
horizon thus serves as the outer rim of the Warao cosmos. The sky is conceived of
as a canopy, supported at the zenith by the cosmic axis.
At the base of the cosmic axis lies a
knotted snake—the Goddess of the Na¬
dir—that has four heads, each facing one
of the cardinal directions. At the highest
level of the Warao cosmos, up where the
bell-shaped canopy narrows, there is an
egg-shaped place of shamanic power.
Warao shaman journey to this supernatu¬
ral zenith by ascending "ropes" of tobacco
smoke. Tobacco is the only mind-altering
substance Warao shamans use, but the
strength and amount they use carry them
into the lofty regions of hallucinatory trance. Thus, like the Desana, the Warao
shamans' complex multilayered cosmology is informed by drug-induced journeys
through the inner planes.
The Kogi, descendants of a spiritual and secretive group in Columbia, also
created an astounding and complex cosmology whose religion, philosophy, and cul¬
tural traditions are comparable to the high cultures of Mesoamerica.19 The Kogi
utilize horizon observations of the sun as well as solar zenith-passage dates. Like
the Desana, the entire Sierra Nevada in which the Kogi live is imagined to follow a
hexagonal plan. The corners of this huge rock crystal correspond to six sacred geo

SHAMANIC TOOLS, THRONES, AND BIRTH PORTALS / 199
graphical sites, while their counterparts in the sky correspond to six first-magnitude
stars centered on Epsilon Orionis. The Kogi retain complex initiation rites involv¬
ing multitiered levels of a shamanic priesthood, and place special emphasis on as¬
tronomical record keeping, which sets them apart from nearby tribes. Although the
Kogi place less of an emphasis on the relationship between astronomy and halluci¬
nogenic drugs, the use of vision-producing substances was certainly a factor in the
creation of their cosmovision.
These examples clearly illustrate the kind of complex multidimensional
cosmologies that arise as a result of using vision plants to induce shamanic states
of mind. The exploration of time and space is an eminently human drive. Mapping
space gives rise to highly geometrized mandalic systems, a cosmology incorporat¬
ing the multidimensional ecology of beings living in our world. Charting time is
somewhat trickier, and involves very closely watching and recording the changing
position of stars. I feel that this temporal aspect of cosmology building was also
influenced and, indeed, facilitated by the use of powerful vision plants.
Though the Kogi Indians of South America have a knack for keeping records of
sky observations, the scientific endeavor of measuring time seems to have fallen to
the pre-Maya people of southern Mesoamerica. Their visionary and scientific skills
should not be seen as incompatible. As it says in the Popol Vuh, "by sheer genius,
by sheer acuity, they got it done." What they "got done," I believe, was the calcula¬
tion of precession. In accomplishing this, the use of the sacred toad and psychoac¬
tive mushrooms apparently played a large role. The vision and dedication required
had to be driven by a deep cosmological insight, the focus of which seems to have
been events to occur during the anticipated alignment. The Galactic Center is a
major player in the end-date alignment, but what is it about the Galactic Center
that is so mysterious? Why was it the goal of vision journeys, and what is so "magi¬
cal" about it?
A BLACK HOLE IN THE SKY
In Joel Davis' fascinating book Journey to the Center of Our Galaxy, we learn
that we are 26,000 light-years from the Galactic Center.20 Recalling that the full
cycle of precession is 26,000 years, this means that the light, or "energy," reaching
us now from the Galactic Center began its journey toward us during the last era in
which the December solstice sun conjuncted the Galactic Center—in 24,000 b.c.



200 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
We can only wonder what this strange coincidence of numbers might mean. Are we
currently experiencing some kind of time resonance with the Earth of 24,000 b.c..
Are we receiving archaic messages through the 2012 time-doorway, knowledge to
help us evolve? What is it about the Galactic Center that might make this possible?
The primary message of Davis' book is that astrophysicists now believe there
is a Black Hole at the center of our Galaxy, a hyper-dense object in which space and
time collapse inward. Black holes were previously thought to be only theoretical
constructs, super-large "wormholes" in space from which even light cannot es¬
cape. Now, cosmologists are actually finding evidence for the existence of Black
Holes, along with other strange stellar beings like quasars and pulsars.21
Incredibly, when we look at Maya texts discussing the Creation event, we find
mention of the concept of a hole in sky. And the evidence is quite specific. David
Stuart and Stephen Houston, epigraphers concerned with deciphering the Maya
hieroglyphic script, wrote a monograph on Maya placenames with a special inter¬
est in identifying the glyphs denoting specific sites. (For example, the glyph name
for Copan consists of a bat.) Some "locations" in hieroglyphic texts, however, do
not appear to be geographical—they refer to mythological places. Although it was
not recognized in the study, since mythology and astronomy go together, these
mythological placenames refer to astronomical locations. As I carefully read the
chapter on mythological placenames, I found intriguing references to astronomical
features associated with the 2012 end-date. Most amazingly, a glyph translated to
mean "black hole" plays an important part in Creation events and king-accession
rites.
A frequently occurring mythic placename in the Classic-period inscriptions is
linked with Creation events, and the glyphic passage in which it is found consists
of the elements "glyph-T-128" (which means "sky"), Yax (first or green), and the
NAL superfix. NAL is related to the Mayan word na, which means both mother
and house. Thus, the location of Maya Creation events is something like the First
Sky-Mother House. This concept indicates that Creation events happen in the First
House of the Mother Sky, the First Era of some great astronomical time cycle in¬
volving the Great Sky Mother, the Milky Way. In every case, the text refers to the
location of events that happen on the date 13.0.0.0.0.22 Here I must point out that
the Fong Count date 13.0.0.0.0 refers, literally, to the end of the current era in a.d.
2012 rather than to its beginning in 3114 b.c.
Now, this is where it gets really interesting. As mentioned, a place-glyph fre



S H AMAN I C TOOLS, THRONES, AND BIRTH PORTALS / 201
quently associated with mythological events of the Zero Time is translated as "black
hole." Remember, the dark-rift is called the entrance to the Underworld or the
Black Road by the Maya,23 and it appears as a "hole" in the sky. The "black hole" of
the Creation text is associated with the Mesoamerican ballgame and its ballcourts,
understandable because, in the Popol Vuh, there is a strong connection between
ballcourts and the Underworld.24 The "black hole" glyphic designation and its af¬
finity with ballcourts and "entrance to the Underworld" contexts strongly associ¬
ate it with the dark-rift in the Milky Way.
Furthermore, the black hole placename "when coupled with the Ahau title ...
can also appear in the name glyph of Classic Period Lords."25 One example from
Lacanha appears after an ut-i (it happened) expression "in inexplicable association
with a 'birth' event that we presume to be mythological in character."26 In other
words, a mytho-astronomical "birth" happened at the "black hole." Interestingly,
the Ahau title of rulership (the "king") is intimately associated with the dark-rift
"black hole" and this "birth" event.
Another mythological placename is ma-ta-wi-la or matawil. Matawil, like the
black hole, can refer to either a title (i.e., "king") or a location.27 So, where is the
king located? The idea of a throne comes to mind, because a throne in the cosmic
center is reserved for kings upon their accession to rulership. In these texts, the
celestial throne appears to be identical with the black hole "birthplace"—the dark-rift
in the Milky Way near the Galactic Center that, according to modern astrophysi¬
cists, contains a Black Hole.
To state these findings unequivocally, we can say that Ahau rulers, in emula¬
tion of the mytho-astronomical Creation scenario, claim for their symbolic throne
the Black Hole birth canal in the sky. This is why there is an association between
title and location attributed to matawil and the black hole. The king becomes king
when he enters the location of his kingship. His accession is likened to a birth,
because at that moment a new being—the king—comes into manifestation.
The fact that astrophysicists are now saying that a Black Hole exists at the
center of our Galaxy makes us wonder about the real knowledge behind the ancient
Maya concepts of Creation and cosmogenesis. They believed that birth/creation
(cosmogenesis) happens at the black hole. Something very profound and mysteri¬
ous is going on here. Is it just a coincidence that lurking deep within the dark-rift
"black hole" is the very real Black Hole at the center of our Galaxy? If not a coinci¬
dence, the dark-rift itself might indeed be the surface signifier of deeper cosmic



202 / MAYA COSMOGEN ESIS 2012
mysteries, ones that the Maya were well aware of. My novel interpretation is not
without additional support from Maya art and literature. Let us look more closely
at how the Maya understood the "black hole in the sky."
SKY CLEFTS, SERPENT ROPES, AN D TRANS DIMENSIONAL
WORMHOLES
The "hole in the sky" is portrayed in Mesoamerican art as a Creation Place or
birthplace. It is also called a "sky cleft" and is considered to be a portal to the
Otherworld. A "sky cleft" is located in the highest point in the sky, in the center of
the cosmic crossroads. (Remember, the Underworld is the night sky.) In terms of
actual astronomy, we are talking about the dark-rift near the Milky Way/ecliptic
crossroads. Maya concepts of birthing involve deities descending along "serpent
ropes" from the sky cleft. In diagram 102, for example,
the deity Nine Wind descends out of a sky cleft. In fact,
sky clefts are extremely abundant in Central Mexican
codices, the symbolism of which can be traced back to
Toltec Teotihuacan and, ultimately, to the Olmec cleft
head motif.
Various forms of sky clefts are also found in the
Maya codices, demonstrating the widespread use of this
very basic Mesoamerican concept. These sky conduits
are portals to other realms through which deities are
"birthed" and descend to Earth on serpent ropes, bring¬
ing with them otherworldly knowledge.
In Mesoamerican ideas
about world Creation, cosmo
genesis takes place via a kind of weaving process. Reality
is thus undergirded by a system of threadlike links. In other
words, space-time itself is woven together in ways that
human beings, stuck within the three-dimensional space
time "fabric" of observable reality, cannot readily perceive.
This philosophical model developed by Mesoamerican
thinkers is actually extremely progressive, for modern
physicists also describe a network of threadlike links be

tween distant places, ''wormholes" in space-time that tunnel through a higher di¬
mension. Physicists even joke about making faster-than-lightspeed journeys to dis¬
tant stars by accessing these holes in space.
Did the Maya access these "wormholes" in
their conjuring ceremonies? Did they "birth" into
local space-time beings from other realms? Did
they travel to distant worlds through these "ser¬
pent ropes?" If we may indulge in a little science
fiction or, perhaps, metaphysical fact, then we
may propose a complex Maya science of shaman
ically invoking a "wormhole" in local space-time,
an opening to the transdimensional realm that
ultimately gets its power from the Black Hole Diagram 104. Wormhole connections
within the Galactic Center, and traveling through in sPacethne- A^r KMa (1982:12>
it to other worlds. The focus of this shamanic
invocation is the Galactic Center, signified by the visible dark-rift; serpent cords
descend and open, providing local space-time access to the Cosmic Source and its
eternal riches. In the deepest sense, Maya philosophers conceived of this "evoca¬
tion of Creation" or "ritual summoning" as a type of birth.28
But what does it mean for a serpent cord to descend and open? Who was travel¬
ing through the hole in space-time? Is such a scenario just a fanciful fairy tale, or
could it have involved the actual activities of Maya kings and shamans? To begin
answering such questions, we can consult Maya iconography, which frequently
portrays ancestors who have been conjured through shamanic vision rites peering
out from the mouths of serpents. These serpents are often shown descending from
a sky cleft, and gods and ancestors also are born (or appear) into this world through
these sky clefts. As Karl Taube wrote, "It is likely that this cleft is a prehispanic
form of the Glory Hole—a celestial conduit... ,"29 The Glory Hole, you may recall,
is the hole at the top of the cosmic house. So, the sky cleft is a hole in the center of
the sky, at the center of the crossroads designating the celestial throne. Since the
center of the crossroads is the location of the sky hole as well as of the celestial
throne of Maya kings, ascending to the cosmic throne must have a lot to do with
vision journeys, conjuring, and magical birthing. However, birthing is the province
of the Mother Goddess—what does she have to do with Maya kings?



COSMOS-MOTHER
Archaeologists have found hundreds of beautiful ceramic
vases from the Classic Period, many painted with hieroglyphs
and mythological scenes. Most of those found are cylinder
shaped, except one, which is rectangular. It depicts birth im¬
agery, and was thus dubbed the "Birth Vase".
Mesoamerican scholar Karl Taube examined this unusual
rectangular vase and identified "wonderfully detailed views
into Classic Maya ritual and mythology pertaining to birth."30
A young goddess sporting a jaguar ear appears on Side I of the
Birth Vase. A sash wrapped around her waist resembles the
ropes or sashes used by midwives to facilitate birthing. She is
surrounded by several old goddesses, who are midwives. Ico¬
nography on the vase suggests they are aspects of Goddess O,
lx Chel. Taube explains that lx Chel is commonly, and wrongly,
associated with the youthful and beautiful goddess when she is actually the old
Goddess O, patron of midwives. She appears to have seven or nine aspects. Accord¬
ing to Bishop Diego de Landa, lx Chel is "the goddess of making children."31 Ix Chel
/Goddess O is thus the Great Mother, patroness of all birthing processes.
The hieroglyphic text on the Birth Vase refers twice to a birth event and spans
a large period of time, suggesting a mythological context. What this reveals is that
mythological and biological birthing share the same imagery. On Side I, apart from
the birth sash that is wrapped around the pregnant woman's stomach, there also is
a rope that she grasps and that is fastened somewhere above her head. In modern
Maya birthing practices, the woman giving birth holds onto a "birth rope," which
is hung from the central roof beams of the house. Taube writes that "the birth rope
is essentially the umbilicus of the house . . . [and] the house constitutes a basic
metaphor for the cosmos."32 We saw this imagery in the ceremonial houses con¬
structed by the Chorti and Yucatec Maya, where the crossbeams symbolize the
four directions and the top joint symbolizes the center of the sky. Even the Classic
period city-builders apparently conceived of the cosmos as a great house because
the central buildings of large Mesoamerican cities were aligned with the larger
cosmos.
In the Yucatec Maya language and elsewhere, the term na means both house
Diagram 105. God¬
dess O and birth ritu¬
al on Side I of the rec¬

SHAMANIC TOOLS, THRONES, AND BIRTH PORTALS / 205
and mother. (Grandmother is nan in Quiche Maya.) For the Tzotzil Maya, the uni¬
verse was like a house or a table. Furthermore, in social life the house is the domain
of the woman, who owns the hearth and tends the fire. Rather than being some
kind of domestic drudgery, this position holds great authority. The woman espe¬
cially adopts this role when she becomes a mother. Thus we see that "house/7
"mother," and "cosmos" are conceptually related. In other words, cosmos = mother.
This equation between cosmos and mother helps us understand the role of the
Milky Way and the dark-rift in the 2012 end-date cosmology. The Milky Way is the
arched sky of the cosmos-mother, and the dark-rift is her birth portal. When the
December solstice sun aligns with her birth cleft, Cosmic Mother gives birth to the
next World Age, the next "Sun." The xibalba be, as the mythic birth-canal, is the
visible marker of the nearby Galactic Center, the de facto Cosmic Womb.
THE BIRTHING THRONE INTHE HEARTOF SKY
Amazingly, in analyzing certain scenes on the birth vase, Taube concludes
that the main figure seated on the "birth throne77 can be either a Maya king or a
pregnant woman.33 This symbology clearly reveals the conceptual parallel between
the king's throne-sitting and the Mother Goddess's throne-birthing. To dispense
kingly authority from the rulership throne (the cosmic center) is equivalent to de¬
livering new life from the birth throne (also the cosmic center). The human womb,
not surprisingly, is likened to the Cosmic Source in the sky. The source of new
beings and the source of the king's authority-to-rule is the same. Apparently, the
Old Goddess O (lx Chel) wields sovereignty over both. Interestingly, Goddess O
imagery overlaps with that of the Jaguar God of the Underworld.34 This makes sense
when we recognize the Old Goddess O as a symbol of the Great Mother. The jaguar's
mouth corresponds to the dark-rift, as does the Great Mother's birth canal. Her
body represents the Milky Way, as does the jaguar's, whose spotted pelt was per¬
ceived as the starry sky. Furthermore, the monster/jaguar mouth and the birth ca¬
nal both represent the throne of the king.

reveal additional details about Maya cosmology and the king's journey into the
cosmic center. These thrones share motifs and physical characteristics such as short,
sturdy legs and beveled edges.35 The "Incienso Throne" (diagram 106) was found
recently within Guatemala City, near the ruins of ancient Kaminaljuyu.



206/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
The edges of this throne depict wave-scrolls, sug¬
gesting that the enthroned king sits on top of the ocean
(or, alternately, on top of the sky). More clearly reveal¬
ing is the crossroads design on the seat itself, showing
the chac-skulls of the four directions, with the ruler
seated in the fifth, or central, zenith direction. Clearly,
this ruler is enthroned at the center of the crossroads,
the meeting point of the four directions—in the center
of the cosmos. This throne symbology seems to have
been universal in Mesoamerica, and in Part IV we will
examine important thrones and throne imagery from
Izapa that pertain directly to the alignment of the
13-baktun cycle end-date.
Given the meaning of Maya birthing symbols de¬
coded thus far, we may summarize the core of the
throne cosmology as follows: King-shaman is bom from the Jaguar Mother and,
enthroned upon the lap of the Galactic Center, forever dispenses authority while
communing with the sacred source—the Great Mother Goddess. Furthermore, not
to neglect the intimate relationship of all this to the alignment of the Long Count
end-date: The throne of the Jaguar Mother manifests when the First Solar King (the
December solstice sun) joins with the Cosmic Mother (the Galactic Center).
Underlying these activities and interests of Maya king-shamans is the role
played by mushrooms and other psychoactive substances in the formulation of the
Long Count and the Hero Twin myth around 300 b.c.—indeed, in the formulation
of Mesoamerican cosmology as a whole. Given that these tools of vision were in
use at that time, we should not be too quick to draw limits on what these
king-shamans and astronomer-priests could or could not have accomplished. The
Long Count calendar—a Galactic Cosmology—is the unique result of a shamanis
tic experiment seemingly conducted in secret, over perhaps three hundred years in
the dimly understood Pre-Classic era. The tools of cosmic knowledge used by the
ancient visionary cosmologists of Mesoamerica to discover and fine-tune their
Galaxy-centered cosmovision were the same ones used by seekers of gnosis in other
times and places—vision plants. The knowledge encoded in the Galactic Long Count
calendar, after being lost for centuries, is now reemerging. Apparently, just in time.

CHAPTER 17
CONJURING CREATION
A
s we discussed in the previous chapter, both kings and pregnant women can
occupy the Maya throne, which symbolically represents the cosmic center
and source of life. In the sky, the source of life is the Galactic Center. On Earth, the
source of life is Mother. Ideally, the design of Mesoamerican cities reflected the
cosmos: The sacred central precinct was the inner zone of the cosmic center from
which divine authority emanated. The great central temple was built directly on
the sacred center and within it the throne was like the inner nucleus of power, the
hot seat and hotline of communion with the cosmic center and source. Despite the
astounding sophistication of these metaphors, this all appears to be quaint myth
until we understand that shamanic journeys (to the center of the sky) were de¬
signed to truly invoke and channel the power resident in the cosmic center, which
would then be dispersed throughout the city and kingdom. On a visionary or meta¬
physical level, the communion effected by king-shamans, in their effort to tap the
source, was a real event, a spirit-journey to the heart and source in the sky. If this
contention seems without precedent, we have only to consider the magical tech¬
nique, or siddhi, practiced by Hindu and Buddhist mystics that involves projecting
their consciousness into distant places. As with all successful shamanic journeys,
the vision-seeker returns with newly acquired power and knowledge. In Maya
thought, this journey was equated with the incredible magic present at the birth of
a child, and thus Maya birthing symbolism rightfully overlaps. So the throne was
207



208 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
the birthplace of world and child, of king and kingdom, and active on that spot were
all the magic forces of birth and death.
Maya kings sat on their thrones, symbols of the cosmic center, and conjured
forth the creative inspiration around which the Maya empire congealed, as if from
nothing. This conjuring power sustained Maya civilization while it lasted; it was
the spiritual conduit to the Heart of Heaven and a connection to the source of life,
cosmic knowledge, and political power. Conjuring was an evocation of deity into
this realm, a kind of birth, a channeling of beings and energies through the "Grand
Central Station" of the cosmic center. How else do transdimensional influences
em erge into our world unless they have been brought through the central nexus via
a type of conjuring? Creation (the world) manifests, is organized, and is defined
through such an act.
The Maya king's throne was the literal hot seat from which he dispensed the
power and organizational energy conjured during his journey to the cosmic center.
However, the connection could be lost. A story of the Yucatec Maya tells that a
celestial conduit "filled with blood" used to connect different Maya cities, and
when it broke, communications failed and cosmic order disintegrated. The Maya
believed that sacrifices were necessary to keep the transdimensional communica¬
tion channels open, and these sacrifices were usually performed by the throne-sitting
king. Some thrones have small depressions on their sides where blood let from the
penis could drip into sacrifice bowls placed below the throne. The parallel between
the king's conjuring and the mother's birthing indicates that thrones were conjur¬
ing stations, portals of transformation, as well as birthing altars. Conjuring and
birthing both took place on what was considered to be a throne, in relation to the
Otherworld portal (the cosmic birth canal), and required sacrifices to be successful.
In Maya thought, throne-birthing and throne-conjuring were two facets of the same
reality.
Imagine the Maya king-shaman seated in contemplation on his stone throne.
He has just ingested a large quantity of the sacred mushroom beverage, mixed with
cacao (chocolate). Incense burns and he begins to swoon as the ancestors appear. In
his mushroom-induced trance he lies back and closes his eyes. In his mind's eye, he
journeys into the inner domains of the cosmic house, and is bathed and renewed in
the nourishing life-force of the Cosmic Mother's womb. He communes with the
spirit beings, receives the sacred teachings, and, hours later, revives and reawakens
on his throne. Upon reentry, he delivers or "births" his new vision into local mani

festation, to vivify and reorganize his realm. As a magician—a symbolic birther
he has successfully conjured Creation, having brought a new being and new knowl¬
edge into manifestation.
NEO-SHAMANS UNITE
The question remains, however, did the ancient Maya visionaries actually travel
into the Galactic Center in heightened states of consciousness? How can we know
for sure? The only way to test this theory, of course, would be to repeat the experi¬
ment. What would be possible if a team of neo-shamans opened their minds to the
Galactic Center? Their shamanistic goal would be not only to find the cosmic cen¬
ter, but to go into it. Visionaries today claim to be doing such courageous con¬
sciousness calisthenics, and we should look carefully at what they tell us. One
such modern cosmonaut is Barbara Hand Clow, who writes of visionary journeys
into the Galactic Center in her book The Pleiadian Agenda. In Chapter 7, she takes
readers on a cosmic journey into the nine-dimensional Galactic Center, where they
meet the "Keepers of Time." The universe is revealed as a multidimensional^
interwoven ecology of evolving intelligences, set to make their presence known by
a.d. 2012. Other inner voyagers have developed shamanic techniques that could be
applied to this Galactic task. For example, Michael Harner has identified a distinct
state of consciousness he calls the Shamanic State of Consciousness, and teaches
how to "journey" while in this state to other dimensions and times.1 Channelers



210 / MAYA COSMOOENE5I5 2012
also claim to be contacting transdimensional beings, and UFO enthusiasts have
their own angle on the opening doorway to come. Our culture, with its growing
appreciation for the reality of nonmaterial worlds and inner experience, is opening
to vast storehouses of universal knowledge that the Maya were very familiar with.
If modern neo-shamans were to focus on the Galactic Center as a destination for
their next knowledge-gathering journey, they would probably encounter the same
insights into time and human becoming that echo, like an inviting laughter, in the
crumbling temples of Mesoamerica. But the shamanic quest for knowledge is pe¬
rennial, universal, and unstoppable. Shamans journey to other worlds with the
intent of returning with secret knowledge not otherwise obtainable, and the place
they must travel through to get there is the end of time and space. Only in that
numinous nowhere can they contact beings from other worlds and times. It is the
center and source that, in fact, is found in the religious ideas of all cultures—it is
the "Grand Central Station" of Being, Heaven, the Huichol Wirikuta, the Well of
All Souls, Tir Na Nog, Xibalba, Mictlan, and the Great Lake of Life.
A GOOD TIME TO CONJURE
What is going on? What is the metaphysical meaning of the end-date align¬
ment? My interpretation is derived as much as possible from Maya iconography
and calendar tradition. According to Maya calendar cosmology, the end of time and
space is 13.0.0.0.0, December 21, 2012.2 However, rather than it being the end of
time and space, we might better speak of it as the center of time and space, which
reflects the indigenous idea of periodic outflow and inflow around the cosmic cen¬
ter—the Maypole dance of cosmic time and human becoming. The source of space
time takes us back into itself during periods of transformation and renewal, and
cosmic time is cyclic rather than linear.
Distinct points in history resonate with the end-date, by way of the harmonics
of the Long Count calendar. These "little" period endings were treated by the Maya
as rehearsals for "the big one," when monuments were smashed, new kings ac¬
ceded to the throne, and vision ceremonies were performed. These conjuring ac¬
tivities were most effective when performed at katun and baktun endings of the
Long Count, because of the natural resonance these dates have with the 2012
end-date. The miniperiod endings were understood to be resonation points with
the far future 13.0.0.0.0 date, for it was believed that the future alignment of bak



CONJURING CREATION / 211
tun 13 signified an open door to the cosmic center, in a sense the arrival of the
cosmic source into local space-time, or, in other words, a renewal by returning into
the central fire. The local and Galactic planes would then be aligned, opening the
way, as the Aztecs said about the end of the Fifth Sun, for the tzitzimime (celestial
demons) to pour down out of the sky to devour mankind. I will have more to say
about the tzitzimime in a moment.
Conjuring ceremonies were planned for harmonic katun endings because, al¬
though the "door" was not fully open on these dates, at least a time-harmonic to
the end-date doorway briefly appeared, which facilitated the channeling of trans
dimensional beings at that time. On the 13.0.0.0.0 date itself, the door will be open
and at that time some people may be more interested in figuring out how to close
it. In fact, the current proliferation of fundamentalist closed-mindedness in politi¬
cal and religious discourse is already on the upswing. This may be a reactionary and
regressive response to the alignment, which, properly understood, is the opening
door to our multidimensional birthright as we approach the Galactic Zero Time of
the Maya.
Major resonances to the 13.0.0.0.0 date include the Great Cycle's midpoint,
6.10.0.0.0: April 17, 551 b.c. This date divides the cycle of precession into ten peri¬
ods of 2,600 tuns (2,563 years) each, rather than five periods of 5,125 years each.
Other time shifts are defined by each baktun ending:
6.0.0.0.0 748 b.c.
7.0.0.0.0 354 b.c.
8.0.0.0.0 41 A.D.
9.0.0.0.0 435 a.d.
10.0.0.0.0 830 a.d.
11.0.0.0.0 1224 a.d.
12.0.0.0.0 1618 A.D.
13.0.0.0.0 2012 a.d.
The Long Count is the Galactic Calendar, and the sub-periods of the 13-baktun
Great Cycle represent eras of resonance with the end-date. The 2012 end-date her¬
alds a global transformation, and Maya history reveals that each baktun ending was
attended by cultural change. European history does not conform as well to the
model, probably because European values and goals have been antagonistic to the
rhythms of nature. Western philosophy as a whole, as it comes down to us and



214/ MAYA COSMOCENESIS 2012
closely at our impending alignment with our cosmic source, fathom its meanings,
listen to what the Maya will tell us, and determine what this transformational shift
means for future humanity. For the ancient Maya, on the far-future Creation Day,
which for us is soon to arrive, Cosmic Mother and First Father join forces to engen¬
der a new World Age. The ancient Maya understood that the future alignment would
have apocalyptic effects, and designed their World Age mythology to remind us of
what is essential, and of what can help us through the transformation. Myth, leg¬
end, or ancient message, whatever it is, clearly the Galactic Alignment means we
must all remember where we come from, where everything comes from: Mother.

E
verything presented in this book up until now leads inescapably to the conclu¬
sion that a profound, sophisticated cosmic knowledge existed in ancient
America. We have reconstructed and explored this ancient knowledge in detail,
yielding a forgotten history of Mesoamerica's ambitious cosmological endeavors.
But where did that cosmic knowledge come from? This too, we can trace and recon¬
struct. What I call the forgotten Galactic Paradigm seems to have been forged in the
minds of brilliant stargazers from a humble ceremonial site at the foot of a mon¬
strous volcano called Tacana. That ancient, sacred place, now crumbling in ruins,
is the source of all this Galactic insight. It is called Izapa.
The Pre-Classic ruins of Izapa are located in southern Mexico near the Guate¬
malan border. Situated at the foot of the Sierra Madre along the narrow Pacific
coastal zone, the fertile land of Izapa receives abundant rainfall and is the center of
age-old cacao production. Chocolate is made from cacao, and in ancient times the
Maya used cacao pods as money. The coastal bioregion in which the ancient city of
Izapa is located, known as Soconusco, stretches north through the state of Chiapas
and south into Guatemala.
Since the 1930s, archaeologists have identified over fifty carved monuments
at Izapa, along with many thrones, altars, and miscellaneous monuments. It is
clear that Izapa was primarily a ceremonial site, a place where rituals were per¬
formed as scheduled by the sacred 260-day calendar. Most astonishing, and a fact
that is very valuable for reconstructing Izapa's cosmological beliefs, is that almost
all of Izapa's monuments were found exactly as they were left some 1,900 years
ago. Some had toppled, and some were buried underneath layers of soil eroded
down from the high volcanic peaks to the north. A few were still exposed to the
moist tropical air of coastal Chiapas, shadowed by thick jungle growth. These carved
219

Diagram 109. Map of Mesoamerica. From Ekholm (1969:xii)
monuments contain amazingly complex scenes depicting characters from Maya
Creation mythology, and it appears they were intentionally oriented toward im¬
portant geographical and astronomical features along the horizon, such as Tacana
volcano to the north. Tajumulco volcano, home of the ancient Fire God, looms to
the northeast, where the June solstice sun rises. Most importantly, a main sight
line from Izapa points to the December solstice sunrise, where, as I will show,
Izapan skywatchers observed and calibrated the convergence of the solstice sun
with the Milky Way.
There are many unanswered questions about Izapa. Why was Izapa located
where it is? Who carved its monuments? Were the Izapan people Maya or Olmec?
Izapan culture arose in a region that bordered several cultural areas. It participated
in the Olmec expansion during the second and first millennia b.c., yet also played
into the later rise of the Maya to the north. Scholars have noted similarities in art



CEREMONIAL CITY OF THE ANCIENT SKYWATCHERS / 221
styles between Izapa and the Zapotec culture of Monte Alban (in Oaxaca), which is
not surprising since Izapa is situated along ancient trade routes that connect Cen¬
tral Mexico with lower Central America. In addition, a nearby mountain pass gave
Izapans access to central Chiapas and the Guatemala highlands. As a result of this
fortuitous combination of geographical circumstances, Izapa had the great fortune
of being in the middle of everything. In fact, in more ways than one, Izapa was the
center of the early Mesoamerican world.
Early evidence of human occupation at Izapa dates to 1500 b.c. By 400 b.c., the
Olmecs had faded, and Izapa was quickly entering the forefront of Mesoamerican
history. The Maya civilization would not be in full swing until six hundred years
later, and by then Izapa was a fading memory. Izapa experienced its heyday be¬
tween the Olmec and the Maya—it was a transitional culture in time, drawing
upon Olmec traditions and feeding the emerging Maya.
Poised in the center of Mesoamerican time and space, the Izapan civilization
clearly had access to great Mesoamerican traditions and ideas. The Izapans had the
opportunity to extract a wide range of ideas and knowledge that passed through
their front yard with traders, traveling calendar-priests, and large-scale ethnic mi¬
grations. In fact, as I will show, Izapa itself was a skywatcher's mecca, a pilgrimage
site visited by high-level shamans and calendar-priests from far-off corners of
Mesoamerica. By 200 b.c., Izapa was already informed by 1,300 years of
Mesoamerican history and cosmology. It is this scenario in which Izapa arose, and
it was Izapa's destiny to formulate an advanced understanding of the cosmos. Most
tellingly, two great traditions arose with Izapa, strongly suggesting that Izapa was
responsible for their creation: the Long Count calendar and the Hero Twin Creation
myth. Although we have already explored how these two systems are related, as
Izapa's story unfolds it will become even more clear how these two traditions—one
calendrical-astronomical and the other mythological—are two sides of the same
coin, and point right to the 2012 end-date.
EXPLORATIONS AT IZAPA
In 1924, explorer Robert Burkitt wrote of mounds and carvings he visited in
the vicinity of Tuxtla Chico, Chiapas. Since the village of Tuxtla Chico is less than
two kilometers from the ruins of Izapa, it appears that Burkitt had stumbled upon
the ceremonial city of the ancient skywatchers.1 Back then, Izapa was in remote



222 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
backhands, rarely visited by outsiders. Today, the closest large city is Tapachula,
some fifteen miles to the north.
By the late 1930s, Izapa was turning the heads of archaeologists, though it was
clearly not as spectacular as Tilcal, Chichen Itza, or Palenque. In 1938, archaeolo¬
gist Karl Ruppert of the Carnegie Institute visited Izapa. Mexican writer C.A. Culebro
published some observations regarding Izapa in 1939, including crude drawings of
Stelae 1 and 5. Working under a joint grant from the Smithsonian Institution and
the National Geographic Society, Matthew Stirling spent a week at Izapa in 1941,
and published his findings in 1943. Stirling is the archaeologist who discovered the
early Long Count monument at Tres Zapotes, in Olmec country. Mayanists J. Eric
S. Thompson and Tatiana Proskouriakoff mention the "Izapan style" of carvings,2
and in the 1950s a Brigham Young University archaeologist named M. Wells Jakeman
published his interpretations of the amazing Stela 5 (see diagram 156).
In four papers on the subject, Jakeman developed his theory that the scene on
Stela 5 illustrates events recorded in the Book of Mormon, in which one of the lost
tribes of Israel came to the Americas in ancient times. In Jakeman's final analysis of
Stela 5, he identified a total of fifteen Old World elements in the scene, providing
evidence for the "Old World origin of an influence upon the ancient American civi¬
lization."3
Jakeman's essays were published between 1953 and 1958, all of them through
Brigham Young University (where he was a senior archaeologist). Brigham Young
University was founded by the Mormons, who believe in ancient connections be¬
tween the Middle East and the Americas. Interestingly, an archaeological program
to explore Izapa was begun by Brigham Young University in 1960—two years after
Jakeman's final paper was published. One wonders if Jakeman really believed his
own theory, or if it was just politics to get BYU to sponsor the dig. An interest in
finding a Middle Eastern origin of the site to prove Mormon history might have
been a motivation. In fact, Matthew Stirling's wife, Marion, who accompanied him
on his excavations in the early 1940s, wrote that Stela 5 led Brigham Young Univer¬
sity to begin the archaeological dig at Izapa.4 An interest in a possible Middle East¬
ern presence at Izapa occurs from time to time in the writings of both Gareth Lowe
(the archaeologist who excavated the site) and V. Garth Norman (who analyzed the
carvings).
In 1962, almost 2,000 years after Izapa's demise, Brigham Young University
embarked upon an extensive four-year scientific excavation of the site. Thirty-six



CEREMONIAL CITY OF THE ANCIENT SKYWATCHERS / 223
years later, Izapa's role in the devel¬
opment of Mesoamerican civilization
and calendar science remains largely
unexplored, despite the academic
studies of the Izapan monuments that
began to emerge in the 1970s. For ex¬
ample, in 1973, BYU scholar V. Garth
Norman published his line drawings
of the Izapan monuments. Izapa's
carvings are in the form of pictures;
there are few hieroglyphs. As such, in¬
terpretation of Izapa's symbology and
cosmovision is approached through
iconography (symbol studies) rather
than epigraphy (hieroglyphic decipher¬
ment). In 1976, Norman's lengthy
analysis of Izapan iconography was
published, revealing his rare sensitiv¬
ity to using local topography and as¬
tronomy as interpretive aids. In 1980,
Norman wrote his Master's disserta¬
tion on the astronomical orientations
of Izapa, which provided the best in¬
formation to date on Izapan astrono¬
my. However, his was only a preliminary study that, apparently, was never ex¬
panded upon.5 Although other academic studies also help to clarify the meaning of
Izapan symbols and their relationships to other art traditions, those studies were
limited to looking at the symbolic or iconographic content of Izapa's monuments.6
My approach to understanding Izapa's monumental message begins with examin¬
ing the local topography and astronomy as a basis for iconographic interpretation.
Most of the iconographic studies completely ignore the orientation of the monu¬
ments within each plaza, their directional relevance to horizon astronomy, and
their spacial relationships.7 As Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson once said, "Mayan
astronomy is too important to be left to the astronomers."8 In the same spirit, I feel
that Izapan iconography is too important to be left to the iconographers.

IZAPA SITE LAYOUT
In studying Izapa, I closely examined precise site maps and larger topographi¬
cal maps to understand how Izapa is oriented to the larger environment. I noticed
that the site contains a combination of important orientations. For one, the north¬
ward orientation is to Tacana volcano. To the northeast, the June solstice sun rises
over Tajumulco volcano, the highest volcanic peak in Central America. Possibly
the most significant orientation, at right angles to the northward "baseline," is to
the rise point of the December solstice sun. Many of the carved monuments face
this horizon, and thus the content of the monuments probably has something to do
with the December solstice astronomy.
As mentioned earlier, Izapa offers us a unique opportunity for understanding
Izapan cosmovision because its monuments were, for the most part, found undis¬
turbed. In this century, their original placements as well as their orientations were
identified, especially those of Groups A
and B, which were in use between 300
b.c. and 50 b.c. A slightly later occupa¬
tion was discovered for Group F, about
one mile north of the main groups, which
may extend into the Post-Classic period.
The primary ritual feature of Group F is
a ballcourt, aligned to the December sol¬
stice sunrise. The monuments in Group
F (see diagram 111) apparently were se¬
lectively taken from other areas and ar¬
ranged according to a ritual pattern that
we will decode in Chapter 22.
Although the stelae, altars, and mis¬
cellaneous monuments in Group F are in
poor condition, the carved symbols sur¬
rounding the ballcourt are particularly re¬
vealing of the deeper symbolism of the
Mesoamerican ballgame. The main Iza¬
pan stelae groups are close together a
short distance south of Group F.

Tacana cleft "T ]



226 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
Here we have the orientation data to construct a picture of Izapa's primary
cosmological interests. A few important points deserve immediate attention. The
Group H "main" baseline points to the peak of Tacana volcano. It is 21° east of true
north, and thus, in geodetic terms, it has a horizon azimuth of 21°. The azimuth
value of any particular point on the horizon is determined by true north being
designated 0°, and, moving eastward or clockwise,
dividing the circular horizon into 360 degrees. Since
true north is given an azimuth of 0°, true east has a
90° azimuth, true south has a 180° azimuth, and so
on. The North Celestial Pole is located along a me¬
ridian extending vertically from the 0° azimuth (true
north). Thus, the Group H axis points to the peak of
Tacana volcano at an azimuth of 21°, that is, 21° east
of the North Celestial Pole. The Group B axis, how¬
ever, points 2° east of the Tacana peak, to a 23° azi¬
muth. Never assuming that these kinds of aberrations
are accidental, I looked closely at pictures of Tacana
and discovered a shallow cleft a short distance down the eastern slope of Tacana, in
fact, roughly 2°. The orientation of Group B, an important monument group, points
directly at the cleft.
The concept of the "mountain cleft" is central to Mesoamerican ideas about
cosmogenesis and the birth of the First Father Solar/Maize God. The perpendicular
(90° angle) to this 23° azimuth baseline points to azimuth 113°, the December sol¬
stice sunrise. Although Group H, which points to Tacana's peak, contains no carved
monuments, Mound 60 in Group H is the largest mound at Izapa, and Tacana can
be sighted over Mound 25 from Mound 60. In fact, the archaeologists who exca¬
vated the site suggested that Mound 25 was intended to conform to the shape of
Tacana.9 Similar pyramid/mountain relationships have been suggested for Cerro
Gordo at Teotihuacan, at Cuicuilco, and at La Venta. In other words, the manmade
pyramid was designed to mirror the deified volcano or mountain in the background.
Group A is to the west of the main Group H plaza, whereas Group B is to the
east of Group H. Groups A and B are Izapa's primary central monument groups,
and both contain a wealth of carved monuments, placed and oriented in specific
ways to encode Izapan ritual, calendrics, and cosmology. Groups C, D, A, E, and F
lie on roughly the same north-south axis. I will restrict my examination of Izapa's



CEREMONIAL CITY OF THE ANCIENT SKYWATCHERS / 227
monuments to Groups A, B, and F, and only briefly mention, when pertinent, the
remaining monuments from other locations. Detailed maps (similar to the one

Izapa's surround¬
ings give us a clue as to
how the Izapans thought
about the cosmos. Their
basic cosmovision re¬
flects two extremes of
nature: volcanoes to the north and ocean to the south. Volcanoes are the lofty sen¬
tinels of the sky and house the ancient Fire God. The ocean is the deep, watery
abode of the cosmic caiman and serpent gods. If we look carefully at the structure
of the pictures on Izapan stelae, we can verify this up-down polarity. Izapan stelae
often contain a standardized basal panel, and the top of
most stelae usually contain a sky panel featuring a cleft.
Many scholars agree that the cleft in the sky panel
represents a stylized jaguar snout, indicating that the
ritual scene below is within the jaguar's mouth, that is,
in the Underworld. (The jaguar's mouth symbolizes the
portal to the Underworld.) This means that the Izapan
message is primarily ritual, mythological, abstract, and
cosmological in nature rather than mundanely histori¬
cal. In comparison, later Maya monuments usually por¬
tray historical events, such as captive sacrifices or king
accessions, rather than cosmological or mythical ones.
The overall up-down frame of presentation in Izapan
stelae suggests a polar or dualistic awareness. Within
Izapan thought, the highest heaven in the lofty regions
Alfsr20
Diagram 115. Three levels of Izapan cosmovision: Volcano, Izapa, Ocean



228 / MAYA COSMOG E N E 5 I S 2012
of the Fire God's dwelling place was somehow reflective of the deepest, watery
home of the cosmic serpent below the sea. Furthermore, Izapa itself, as symbol of
the unifying middle, is situated right between the two cosmic extremes, and thus
there are three levels present in Izapan cosmovision (see diagram 115).
In general, the Izapan worldview, as revealed by its monuments, conforms to a
north-south model. The terrestrial reference is to the northward volcanoes and the
southward ocean. However, we will see that the primary interest of the Izapan
calendar-priests was with the astronomical events that occurred to the north and
south. In this kind of thinking, up-down, north-south, and sky-Underworld are
complementary opposites, and events that occur in the two opposed realms reflect
each other. For example, the deepest center of the Underworld ocean was conceived
of as being equivalent to the highest point of the night sky. This derives from the
Mesoamerican idea that the night sky is the Underworld.10 Said another way, the
night sky is the cosmic ocean. The up-down (or north-south) framework helps us
interpret Izapan cosmovision and suggests the profound intellect employed by Izapan
astronomers in their shamanic-scientific efforts to understand the cosmos. Ulti¬
mately, as we will see, the Izapan dualistic, or dialogical,11 framework explains the
formulation of the Long Count, with its 13.0.0.0.0 date placed on a rare alignment
in the cycle of precession.

efore examining Izapan calendrics, cosmology, and astronomy in detail, we
will take a look at the wider context in which Izapa arose. This will help us
understand the place occupied by Izapa in the flow of Mesoamerican history, and
the practices, beliefs, and traditions that contributed to its development.
THE INVENTION OF THE LONG COUNT
The Long Count calendar was a system of time-keeping used primarily by the
Classic-period Maya (a.d. 200-a.d. 900). Many Maya carvings are dated with the
baktuns, katuns, tuns, and uinals of the Long Count. As sketched earlier, the 13
baktun cycle of the Long Count began in 3114 b.c. However, contrary to miscon¬
ceptions in the literature,1 this does not mean that the Maya invented it that far
back—a rather absurd idea. The real barometer of when the Long Count system
was invented is found by looking at the archaeological record. The earliest monu¬
ments dated in the Long Count date to the first century b.c., before the Classic
period Maya arose. There are only a few Long Count monuments dating prior to
a.d. 41, and these are called Cycle 7 monuments because they were carved during
baktun 7 (354 b.c.-a.d. 41). Monuments dating to Cycle 7 and early Cycle 8 were
found over a limited geographical area of southern Mesoamerica, with Izapa near
the center of the distribution (see diagram 116).
Since Izapa was one of the most prominent ritual centers active during the
first century b.c., I believe that it played a major role in the formulation of the
229



230/ MAYA COSMOG E N E S I S 2012
Long Count. In fact, as mentioned ear¬
lier, Mayanist Michael Coe credits
the Izapan civilization with the in¬
vention of the Long Count. The ear¬
liest known Cycle 7 date (37 b.c.) was
found at Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas,
Mexico.
Archaeologist Matthew Stirling
unearthed and identified Tres Za
potes Stela C as
a Cycle 7 Long
Count date. How¬
ever, when he
found it in 1941,
the top half with
the baktun glyph
was broken off and
missing. Based
upon archaeologi¬
cal context and the remaining glyphs,
he dated it as 7.16.6.16.18. Many
scholars ridiculed Stirling's belief that
Stela C contained such an early date. Incredibly, decades later the baktun section
was found at the site, and it indeed turned out to be baktun 7.
East of Izapa, along the Pacific
Coast in Guatemala, an early cen¬
ter known as El Baul sports a Cycle
7 date (see diagram 119).
Michael Coe wrote that this
stela, dated to a.d. 37, "conforms
to the Izapan style."2 The early
people of El Baul were contempo¬
raneous with Izapa. Furthermore,
Abaj Takalik, a sister city to Izapa
located just sixty-five kilometers

to the east, contains a Cycle 7 Long Count date. Many other undated monuments
at Abaj Takalik are similar to the Izapan style, and we will examine these later.
Baktun 7 ended in a.d. 41, which marked 8/13ths
completion of the Great Cycle of thirteen baktuns.
One wonders if this apocalyptic baktun-shift preoc¬
cupied Izapan cosmonauts. It is unfortunate that no
Long Count dates have yet been found within Izapa.
But given the presence of Long Count dates at sev¬
eral contemporaneous sites with which Izapa no
doubt had contact, the esoteric understanding of the
Long Count end-date must have been known to
Izapan astronomer-priests. I suspect they were prob¬
ably the ones who made the astronomical discovery
of precession and did the calculations, since Izapa
appears to have been the dominant site in the sphere
of Cycle 7 Long Count dates. In addition, the astro¬
nomical information encoded in the Izapan monu¬
ments points right at the alignment of baktun 13
the end of the 13-baktun cycle of the Long Count.
Around the end of baktun 7 in a.d. 41, the Izapan
astronomer-priests may have been thinking, "exactly five more baktuns to go."
Support for my belief that the Long Count was invented as a result of astro¬
nomical calculations made at Izapa is provided by archaeologist Gareth Lowe, who
identified fish symbols on Stelae 1 and 5 as prototypal tun and katun glyphs.3 He
proposes that the twenty or so carved monuments in Groups A, B, and D represent
the seating of the twenty katuns of the Long Count baktun cycle.
Despite the fact that the appearance of the Long Count, in time and place, is
well-established, controversy among different academic camps still simmers. I feel
that the pictographic evidence supplied by the Izapan monuments settles the mat¬
ter. We know that the earliest Long Count dates in the archaeological record go
back to the first century b.c. Accepting that the Long Count was a calendar for
tracking precession, and precession is a phenomenon that might take two hundred
years to calibrate, the Long Count calendar was probably being perfected between
250 b.c. and 50 b.c. Other scholars have proposed that the invention of the Long
Count goes further back, to 355 b.c., 550 b.c., or 236 b.c.4 Perhaps there are more
Diagram 119. Cycle 7 date. Stela

Long Count dates to be found, but at this point it is safe to say that the Izapan
culture was instrumental in the invention of the Long Count calendar. As Michael
Coe put it: . . the priority of Izapa in the very important adoption of the Long
Count is quite clear cut. . . ."5
THE IZAPAN DOMAIN: IZAPA AND ITS NEIGHBORS
The bioregion in which Izapa is situated includes the entire Pacific Coast strip
running from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in the north into Guatemala and El Sal¬
vador in the south. This area was known in ancient times as Soconusco. It provided
an easily traversed trade route between northern and southern Mesoamerica. The
major trade route through the Sierra Madre and into the Chiapan basin of the upper
Grijalva River passed through Huixtla via the Motozintla pass, just northwest of
Izapa.
A minor trade route, which was also a pilgrimage trail to Tacana volcano, led
into the Guatemalan highlands via Union Juarez north of Izapa. This gave the trav¬
eler access to what is now Mam territory and the ancient sites of Tajumulco and
Zaculeu. Highland-lowland trade interaction must have been significant, as the
cacao grown around Izapa in ancient (and modern) times was valued throughout
Mesoamerica. A design on a ceramic vessel found at
Zaculeu, though dated later than Izapa, resembles the
motif on Izapa Stelae 67 and 22.
In the 1940s, archaeologists Bertha Dutton and
Hulda Hobbs excavated Post-Classic mounds at
Tajumulco and suggested occupation of this site go¬
ing back to the Pre-<plassic.6 Although most of their
findings were Post-Classic and related to the Pipil
culture, the authors considered Tajumulco as belong¬
ing to Soconusco, given its proximity to Izapa (forty
kilometers) and the ancient trails through border-re¬
gion Sibinal down to Izapa. They even suggested that intensive trade occurred be¬
tween Izapa and Tajumulco, and that Izapa's role as a ritual center may have passed
to Tajumulco after its decline around a.d. 100. After all, Tajumulco is situated on
the slopes of the highest volcanic deity in Central America, which is the June sol¬
stice marker viewed from Izapa. Clearly, a full pilgrimage cycle outward from Izapa
Diagram 120. Depiction ofAhau

SOUTHERN MESOAMERICA, 200 BC: THE IZAPAN CIVILIZATION / 233
would have included Tajumulco as well as Tacana.
Many of the motifs in Izapan and Tajumulcan art
are shared. Compare Izapa Monument 53 with
Tajumulco's stone sculptures J and O.
The ancient relationship between Izapa and
Tajumulco unfortunately is muddied by the con¬
tinuous occupation of Tajumulco into the Post
Classic, which effectively destroyed most of its
earlier artifacts. Most likely, some kind of con¬
nection can be postulated for pilgrimage reasons,
because Izapan calendar-priests would have been
interested in making regu¬
lar ritual offerings to the Fire
God resident in Tajumulco.
Diagram 121. a) Tajumulco sculptures
f and O; b) Izapa Monument 53
To the southeast of Izapa, just across the border into Gua¬
temala, a broken Izapan-style stela was found at a small site
called El fobo. Notice the Izapan-style sky-cleft panel at the
top.
Abaj Takalik, a site that thrived at the same time as Izapa,
contains many fascinating
sculptures and monuments,
including a Cycle 7 monu¬
ment, Stela 2.
The central column
serves as the baktun tree in
which the Long Count date
is recorded, flanked by cer¬
emonial attendants on the
left and right. A cosmic bird
is depicted at the top of the Stela 2 scene, out of
whose mouth emerges a deity. Another interest¬
ing carving from Abaj Takalik was examined by
Mesoamerican scholar Lee Allen Parsons (see dia¬
gram 124).7
In this image, a warrior ascends a snake-con

the stela. This is a common motif found
throughout Mesoamerica, especially noted at
Chichen Itza. hi the center of the snake's birth¬
place, two U-shaped "mouths" face each other
and bracket the lower portion of the carving.
Between these two mouths flow water scrolls,
in the center of which is a four-cornered U
glyph out of which emerges the vision ser¬
pent. Here we have recognizable motifs: the
quadrated symDiagram 124. Abaj Takalik Stela 4

ments 7 and 27
bol of the cross¬
roads and the
U-shape of the cosmic birth canal out of which is born
a deity-ruler with his serpentine "spirit companion."
Unusual flower motifs adorn the stela, and the basal
panel resembles the cleft-like jaguar-snout sky pan¬
els of Izapan stelae.
Further east, El Baul, where the Cycle 7 monu¬
ment Stela 1 was found (see diagram 119), contains
many impressive Pre-Classic and Classic-period mon¬
uments.
The two carvings shown to the left are from a
later occupation of El Baul, after a Classic-period mi¬
gration from Central Mexico. However, the Monu¬
ment 7 motif of a solar deity emerging from the mouth
of an Underworld deity (a crab) compares to Izapa Stela
11, which depicts a solar deity emerging from the
mouth of a frog. Despite later invasions of foreigners,
El Baul had an early occupation that was contempo¬
raneous with Izapa.
Kaminaljuyu, present-day Guatemala City, rose
to prominence during Izapa's decline. Kaminaljuyu
was a bustling trade center during the late Pre-Clas¬
sic and retained trade alliances with places as far



SOUTHERN MESOAMERICA, 200 BC: THE IZAPAN CIVILIZATION / 235
flung as Toltec Teotihuacan in Central Mexico. Trade items between these great
Pre-Classic cities must have passed through Izapa. Unfortunately, very little re¬
mains of Kaminaljuyu, though more and more artifacts are coming to light. The
ruins of Kaminaljuyu have, lamentably, been largely obliterated by the mindless
growth of Guatemala City in recent decades. The thrones and stelae that bulldoz¬
ers accidentally plowed up
were sold to collectors or
placed in local private muse¬
ums. Fortunately, many of
them were photographed and
documented, so there is a
growing record of Kaminal¬
juyu sculpture.
The Kaminaljuyu ball
game marker, a symbolic goal¬
ring, shown in Relief 2 here,
resembles an Aztec stone
marker illustrated in Laurette
Sejourne's book Burning Wa¬
ter, where it is called a “hiero¬
glyph for a cycle of time/78 This connection between the ballgame goalring and
time cycles reinforces my interpretation of the ballgame as a metaphor for the 2012
alignment. The goalring (representing the dark-rift in the Milky Way) symbolizes
the place where time begins and ends. After all, when the ball goes into the goalring,
the game (of time) is over.
The central glyph column on Kaminaljuyu Altar 2 probably originally con¬
tained a Long Count date. The axis mundi in this carving, flanked by two atten¬
dants, is a conventional arrangment that partakes of what I call “the fire-drill sym¬
bol/79 and also can be seen on Izapa Stela 2, Abaj Takalik Stela 2, El Baul Stela 1 (a
Cycle 7 date), and elsewhere. The meanings of Mesoamerican “fire-drill77 rituals
survive among the modern Tzutujil Maya of Guatemala, and involve weaving,
birthing, and male-female intercourse.10 Fire-drill symbolism is present in the New
Fire ceremony of the Toltecs, which involved the drilling of the New Fire in the
chest cavity of a sacrificial victim. Significantly, this occurred at the end of each
fifty-two-haab time period, the Toltec unit of World Age measure. The drilling of
Diagram 126. Kaminaljuyu. a) Relief 2 (ballgame marker); b)

ture 6; e) Stela 11, with Izapan-style basal panel



the New Fire inaugurated a new cycle of time, and the portrayal of the figures on
Kaminaljuyu Altar 2 and elsewhere as "fire drillers" is probably an intentional
metaphor. The fire-drill symbol is especially relevant to the placement of early
Long Count dates along the vertical axis of the fire-drill "shaft." In Old World cosmo
conception, the fire-drill symbol is very ancient. As discussed in Part I, the cosmic
fire drill was thought to be fixed upon the Pole Star, and it determined the end of
the world when it finally wore out its "hinge." Similar meanings must have existed
in Izapan cosmology, which involved, as we will see, a total of three cosmic centers
(polar, zenith, and Galactic).
Continuing with the Kaminaljuyu carvings shown above, Stela 11 has an Izapan
style basal panel. Monument 47 may represent a "serpent canoe," similar to the
"Ahau boat" depicted on Izapa Stelae 6, 22, and 67. Pedestal Sculpture 6 resembles
Izapa Miscellaneous Monument 4 and may be a form of zenith gnomon.
Most of these various examples are contemporaneous with the Pre-Classic
Izapan context. We could examine many more Pre-Classic sculptures from the Pa¬
cific coasts of Chiapas and Guatemala, at the sites of Santa Lucia Cotzumalhuapa,
Bilbao, Tonala, Chiapa de Corzo, and elsewhere, but the point is clear. Izapa and its
related highland contact areas embraced a rich archaeological zone not very exten¬
sively studied. A lot was going on in this overlooked corner of Mesoamerica even
before the Maya began their ascent to civilization in the Peten lowlands to the
north. Izapa was the major ritual center in this time and place, defining the art
styles and cosmological ideas for other sites within its large sphere of influence.
With its Olmec antecedents and pre-Maya flowering, it truly did occupy the transi¬
tional era between the Olmec and the Maya. Between 500 b.c. and a.d. 50, Izapan
skywatchers were engaged in an important ongoing endeavor that must have influ¬
enced the worldview of other regional sites such as Abaj Takalik, El Baul, and Chiapa
de Corzo, all of which contain Cycle 7 dates. In addition, Kaminaljuyu, the major
Pre-Classic site rivaling Teotihuacan, probably adopted many of the cosmological
ideas pioneered at Izapa.
IZAPA: BIRTHPLACE OF THE HERO TWIN CREATION MYTH
The mythic message on Izapan monuments describes distinct episodes in the
Quiche Creation story, the Popol Vuh. As you will remember, the Quiche Popol
Vuh was recorded in the 1550s, and was probably derived from an actual hiero



SOUTHERN MESOAMERICA, 200 BC: THE IZAPAN CIVILIZATION / 237
glyphic book. The Hero Twins and their Popol Vuh adventures have been identified
at Classic sites and on Classic-period ceramics. Going back further, we can identify
Hero Twin actions and Popol Vuh episodes on the monuments of Izapa. Clearly,
Izapa contains the first manifestation of the Hero Twin story in the archaeological
record. This version of the Maya Creation myth, being some 1,800 years older than
the Quiche Popol Vuh, is better referred to as the Hero Twin story, to avoid confu¬
sion over semantics. No, the Quiche were not hanging around Izapa 2,000 years
ago. But the Quiche legend called the Popol Vuh, like most epics, belongs to a wider
cultural context, and some form of it goes back thousands of years. The Hero Twins'
adventures and their battles with Seven Macaw (the Big Dipper) comprise a Cre¬
ation myth filled with astronomical symbolism that first appears at Izapa. Appar¬
ently, the Izapans were the ones who created it. They no doubt adopted older mo¬
tifs into their new cosmology, such as the concept of the cleft mountain as an
emergence place. However, some shift in cosmological understanding must have
stimulated the formulation of the new Creation myth.
Beatriz Barba de Pina Chan interpreted over a dozen Izapan stelae as represent¬
ing aspects of the Popol Vuh (or Hero Twin story).11 The fantastic Stela 5 is thought
to be the primordial Creation scene. V. Garth Norman and Gareth Lowe both char¬
acterize Stela 5 as an ancient Mesoamerican migration story involving the Maya
creator couple Xpiyacoc and Xmucane, and call it an early version of the Quiche
Popol Vuh.12 The central tree in Stela 5 is the Tree of Life and the sitting figures
include Hunahpu and Xbalanque. Other Izapan stelae depicting motifs from the
Hero Twin myth are shown in diagram 127.
According to Pina Chan, Stela 21 is one of the Xibalban lords cutting off the
head of the Hero Twins' father, One Hunahpu. Stela 2 represents the head of One
Hunahpu being hung in the crook of the calabash tree in Xibalba. Stela 27 depicts
a gameball (or a corn seed) being delivered to Blood Moon, which may symbolize
her impregnation with the Hero Twins. Stela 10 depicts Blood Moon sitting by the
Milky Way tree, in which One Hunahpu's head hangs, preparing to impregnate
Blood Moon. She is depicted umbilically connected to the Hero Twins, that is,
pregnant with them. On Stela 4, a new head is being made for Hunahpu, an event
that takes place during the Twins' ballgame with the Lords of Xibalba. According
to Pina Chan, Stelae 22 and 67 are scenes of the Hero Twins' self-sacrifice, death,
transformation, and resurrection. Stela 60 shows the final defeat and sacrifice of
the Xibalbans at the hands of the Hero Twins. Stela 9, according to Pina Chan, is



238/ MAYA COSMOOEN ESIS 2012
Hunahpu and Xbalanque being
transformed into the sun and
moon at the end of the story.
Other Izapan scenes interpreted
by Pina Chan in terms of Hero
Twin mythology include Stelae 6,
14, 19 and 20, 50, and 11. Al¬
though some of Pina Chan's iden¬
tifications are not convincing, she
is correct in emphasizing that the
Hero Twin Creation myth is the
primary concern of Izapa's monu¬
ments. As we have seen, this myth
ultimately describes the resurrec¬
tion of the Hero Twins' father,
One Hunahpu, which is a mythic
metaphor for the rebirth of the
solstice sun through the Milky
Way cleft.
Finally, on Stela 25, we find
an important depiction of the
Popol Vuh episode in which Hunahpu's arm is
torn off by Seven Macaw (see diagram 128).
Luckily for us, Brigham Young University ar¬
chaeologists recovered this stela from looters in
the town of Tapachula as it was being prepared
for the black market. It shows Hunahpu dealing
with the Seven Macaw/Big Dipper deity, the false
sun of a previous World Age.13 The inverted
caiman on the left is the Milky Way. Its head and
mouth (where the dark-rift is located) are under
Diagram 127. Izapan stelae depicting motifs and episodes
from the Quiche Popol Vuh



SOUTHERN MESOAMERICA, 200 BC: THE IZAPAN CIVILIZATION / 239
neath the basal panel, that is, under the Earth, indicating that it is not above the
horizon at the moment depicted. Notice the up-down polarity between the Big
Dipper and the dark-rift, united via the artificial vertical pole held by Hunahpu,
clearly portraying the basic structure of the Izapan worldview, which operates via a
dialogue between astronomical events in the north and
analogous events in the south. As such, the polar cen¬
ter occupied by Seven Macaw counterposes the Galac¬
tic Center hidden within the mouth of the Cosmic
Caiman (the Milky Way).
We have seen that the Izapan civilization, the tran¬
sitional culture between the Olmecs and the Maya,
occupied the center of an innovative phase of Pre-Clas¬
sic ritual activity in southern Mesoamerica. Further¬
more, because so many of Izapa's monuments contain
Mesoamerica's earliest depictions of the Maya Creation
story—even specific episodes that survive in the lat¬
ter-day Quiche Popol Vuh—Izapa was clearly the place
where the Popol Vuh/Hero Twin Creation myth was
formulated.
Understanding the wider context in which Izapa arose clarifies for us the tradi¬
tions and ideas that informed Izapan cosmovision. As a result of our careful look at
iconography and calendar dates found at related sites, we have reconstructed Izapa
as the center of Pre-Classic thought in southern Mesoamerica. Now, before em¬
barking upon our exploration of Izapan astronomy, cosmology, and the astronomi¬
cal information encoded in Izapa's mytho-astronomical monuments, we must first
explore some important facets of the Izapan calendars.

CHAPTER 20
IZAPAN CALENDRICS
I
t is already clear that the Long Count calendar was invented by the Izapan
skywatchers. As such, the Long Count is an Izapan calendar. But what about the
260-day tzolkin calendar? The earliest known occupation of Izapa began around
1500 b.c., which places the origin of Izapan culture prior to when many scholars
feel the 260-day calendar was invented. Izapa is therefore a candidate in the quest
to locate the origin place of the 260-day sacred calendar, and one scholar in particu¬
lar has looked closely at this possibility. By tracing the evolution of the calendar
systems of Mesoamerica through temporal and geographical distribution, Vincent
Malmstrom argued that Izapa was, in fact, the origin site of the 260-day calendar.
His reason is astounding in its simplicity and involves the intervals between the
two solar zenith passages at the 15°N latitude of Izapa.1
ZENITH INTERVALS: LATITUDE AS CALENDAR
Earlier in this book, we discovered that the sun passes through the zenith at
high noon twice a year within the Tropics. However, the dates of the solar zenith
passage change with latitude, and the further south one goes, the larger the interval
between the two zenith passages becomes. The zenith-passage dates at Izapa are
August 12 and May l.2 The significance of the zenith-passage intervals at Izapa lies
in the resulting division of the year into 105- and 260-day sections.
Izapa's identity as origin place of the tzolkin calendar is supported by the 260
day interval between its August and May zenith passages. In the Izapan mind, this
represented the sacred interval between the sun's two passings through the Heart of
241



December solstice
242 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
Heaven, from its birth to its rebirth. And you may
remember that Maya shamans also equated the 260
day period with the nine-month period of human ges¬
tation, from conception to birth. The Izapan zenith
passages were observed with vertical gnomons, up¬
right pillars that cast no shadows at high noon on
the zenith-passage days. Several zenith gnomons have
been found at Izapa, notably the three pillar-and-ball
monuments in Group B and Monument 4 in Group F. But there is more. The Long
Count calendar also is indicated by the 15°N latitude of Izapa, for two reasons:
Diagram 129. Zenith intervals
within the solar year at Izapa
• The first zenith passage at Izapa, August 12, was the first day of the Great
Cycle of 13 baktuns (0.0.0.0.1 = August 12, 3114 b.c.).3
• December 21, the December solstice, lies halfway between the August and
May zenith passages at Izapa, and is the last day of the Great Cycle of 13
baktuns (13.0.0.0.0 = December 21, 2012 a.d.).
Notice in the diagram above how the solstice axis divides the zenith-passage
intervals into equal halves. The June solstice divides the lesser interval into two
periods of 52V2 days each, and the December solstice divides the 260-day interval
into two 130-day periods. The solstice axis is thus a kind of temporal axis mundi,
suggesting a meaning for the December solstice as "center point,/ or Zero Point.
And, of course, the 13-baktun cycle end-date (the December solstice of 2012) points
to a temporal Zero Point (in precession) as well as to the center of the cosmic cross¬
roads (in space)—the Galactic
Center.
The solstices were very
important in the early calen¬
dar systems of Mesoamerica.
A common and very ancient
concept in Maya thinking in¬
volved a four-cornered image of
the cosmos, based on the rise
and set points of the sun on the
solstices.
Diagram 130. A four-cornered solstice cosmogram



IZAPAN CALENDRICS / 243
This cosmo-conception, used to model time as well as space, is found among
the Tzutujil, Chamula, and Quiche Maya, the Mixe-Zoque Indians of Santa Clara,
in the alignments of Uaxactun in the Peten, and at Izapa.4 The four corners simul¬
taneously represent the four calendric year-bearers, the pillars of the sky, and the
arms and legs of a human being. Most importantly, the solstice cosmogram em¬
ployed by the Izapans represents the four places along the horizon where the sun
rises and sets on the solstices. At Izapa, the two solstice points along the eastern
horizon were very important.
The June solstice sunrise took place over Tajumulco volcano. The December
solstice horizon is where the Milky Way and the dark-rift near the Galactic Center
rose before the sun in the era of Izapa's heyday. In other words, the December sol¬
stice horizon is where the convergence of the Milky Way and the solstice sun was
observed and cali- June
brated by Izapan as¬
tronomers.
A fact that helps Diagram 131. Solstice horizon to the east of Izapa
us understand Izapan
cosmovision is that the sun rises furthest south (i.e., the "lowest") on the Decem¬
ber solstice. In comparison, 130 days later, on the May 1 zenith passage, the sun
passes through the zenith (i.e., reaches its "highest"). Thus, to reiterate, the 130
day interval between the solstice and the zenith passage reveals a solar movement
from lowest to highest. It may seem like this interpretation utilizes mixed meta¬
phors, in that the "lowest" criterion applies to the southernmost rise point of the
sun whereas the "highest" criterion applies to the sun's passage through the zenith.
If we keep our metaphor categories straight, the opposite of the zenith passage should
be the nadir, not the southernmost solar-rise azimuth. However, we will see that
this kind of analogy-based thinking, in which different categories of experience are
perceived to operate in parallel, is intrinsic to the multidimensional consciousness
of Izapan skywatchers.
The primary players in the Izapan calendar thus appear to be the solstice dates
and the zenith-passage dates. This explains the importance of these key dates, and
encourages us to look at the astronomical movements on these dates. We will ex¬
amine the details of these astronomical movements later, but we can pause here to
propose a general model of how the solstices relate to the zenith passages.



THE SOLAR-LUNAR DIVISIONS OF THE IZAPAN
ZENITH CALENDAR
The information sketched thus far suggests that the key dates of the Izapan
calendar were used to structure solar and lunar processes. As just mentioned, be¬
tween the December solstice and the May 1 zenith passage (130 days) the sun goes
from "lowest" to "highest." Significantly, during this same period of time, the moon
goes from new to full.5 If the moon was new on the December solstice, it would be
full on the May 1 zenith passage. These two processes, though different in nature,
were probably understood to mirror each other. The sun mimics the moon in its
new-to-full process because, at the December solstice, the sun is furthest south
(i.e., just born or "new"), whereas on the May zenith passage it reaches the highest
heaven in the north (i.e., completed or "full"). This solar-lunar model emerges from
looking at the key dates derived from Izapa's latitude.
The overall point here is to identify the most likely days that played a role in
Izapan seasonal festivals. The May zenith passage is particularly relevant because
at Izapa, as in other areas of Mesoamerica, it signals the beginning of the rainy
season. In fact, the May zenith-passage observation survives today as a syncretic
blend of indigenous and Christian concepts in the Festival of the Holy Cross, cel¬
ebrated on May 3 in many Mesoamerican communities. The June solstice is clearly
significant because of its orientation to Tajumulco volcano, the highest volcano in
Central America (4,220 meters). The December solstice remains significant because
of its importance in being the perpendicular to the Group B Izapan baseline, and for
the astronomical convergence that occurs in that direction. In addition, the De¬
cember solstice divides the 260-day interval between solar zenith passages in half.
The northward Group B baseline, as mentioned, points to the "cleft of Creation"
along the eastern slope of Tacana volcano. As we will see, this northern horizon
also is the location of important astronomical events. To summarize the most note¬
worthy dates in the Izapan seasonal calendar:
• the December solstice
• the May 1 zenith passage
• the June solstice
• the August 12 zenith passage
We now have four days, probably the most significant days in the Izapan calen

dar, that we can use to examine the changing Izapan skies over a year. The details of
this examination are covered in the next section, but I can say at this time that the
astronomy on these dates implicates the three cosmic centers that were of interest
to the Izapan skywatchers—the North Celestial Pole, the zenith, and the Galactic
Center.
THE IZAPAN CALENDAR ROUND RECONSTRUCTED
We have already seen that the Long Count was a calendar created by the Izapans.
In addition, the 260-day tzolkin calendar itself also may have been invented by them.
But what about the other traits of the Izapan calendar? What year-bearers did they
use in their tzolkin calendar? When was their New Year's Day? In my book The
Center of Mayan Time, I reconstructed the Izapan tzolkin-haab calendar. The combi¬
nation of the 260-day tzolkin cycle with the 365-day haab results in a 52-year cycle
known as the Calendar Round. The motive behind my reconstruction was a glaring
conceptual error in the academic literature. Scholars assume that the 4 Ahau 3 Kankin
tzolkin-haab combo usually given for the Long Count end-date represents the haab
used by the people who first devised the Long Count. In fact, this tzolkin-haab combo
is from the Tikal calendar, which arrived on the scene several hundred years after the
Long Count was invented.6 By the time the Tikal calendar was instated, the earlier
haab placement of the Izapan calendar had probably shifted several times.
The transformations of calendar systems throughout Mesoamerican history
are complex. The best source on this question is Munro Edmonson's Book of the
Year. Possible changes to Mesoamerican calendar systems include the year-bearer
system used (of five possible ones) and the haab date. It should be emphasized that
the tzolkin calendar was never altered. The 260-day cycle has been followed unbro¬
ken for almost 3,000 years, and the same placement survives today. The haab date
changes when different year-bearers are adopted or when haab-month counting shifts
between 0-19 and 1-20 (this shift involves the choice of whether to begin counting
the haab month from 0 or from 1).
My assumption in reconstructing the Izapan Calendar Round is that the Izapan
calendar, as an expression of a very early calendar, used Type V year-bearers. These
year-bearers are Ahau, Chicchan, Oc, and Men (Yucatec Maya day-names are used
here). Their polarities are obvious (see diagram 132).
The meanings of these opposed day-signs are perhaps the most time-resistant



246 / MAYA COSMOCENESIS 2012
and compelling of all the day-signs. Chicchan
Men (Serpent-Eagle) recalls the ubiquitous
Mesoamerican Quetzalcoatl deity (Quetzal =
Bird; Coatl = Serpent). As Munro Edmonson
explained, the four calendric year-bearers were
associated with the four seasonal quarters—the
two equinoxes and the two solstices.7 One of
the year-bearers was always thought of as pri¬
mary, and each 52-year Calendar Round began
when this senior year-bearer coincided with the
coefficient 1 to initiate a new year. The senior
year-bearer in the Type V system was probably Ahau, given the important mean¬
ings and uses of this day-sign and its potent mythological associations. Earlier, I
showed how the seasonal quarter corresponding to Ahau in the archaic
Mesoamerican calendar was the December solstice.8 The reasoning behind this belief
is quite simple: The December solstice is the first day of the year, thus its associa¬
tion with Ahau, the primary or senior day-sign. What follows is the clear-cut con¬
notation of 1 Ahau with the First Sun and the deity First Father/One Hunahpu, a
significant identification because 1 Ahau (One Hunahpu) is the name of the Hero
Twins' father in the Popol Vuh. The related concept chain suggests that the Decem¬
ber solstice sun is to be understood as "First Father," the Solar Lord who is reborn
as the new World Age ruler at the end of the Popol Vuh Creation myth. Elsewhere,
First Father/One Hunahpu has a second identity as the Maize Deity because maize,
like the sun, is a source of life. The Mesoamerican association between maize, the
sun, and deity resurrection is understandable, partly because maize is reborn every
year at harvest time and the sun is reborn every year at the December solstice.9
As mentioned, Munro Edmonson reconstructed the earliest Olmec calendar
and he identified the June solstice as the primary start point. For the Izapans, the
primacy of the December solstice over the June solstice is apparent from consider¬
ations already sketched. Historically, the December solstice was considered to be
the New Year's Day by several Maya groups. In the interest of condensing a lot of
my previous research and arguments into the essential conclusions, my reconstruc¬
tion of the Izapan Calendar Round is as follows:
Diagram 132. Day-sign wheel showing
polarities of the Type V year-bearers
The Izapan Calendar consisted of Type V year-bearers and counted haab months



IZAPAN CALENDRICS / 247
from 1 to 20: 1 Ahau 1 Pop began the Calendar Round every 52 years.
• An Izapan Calendar Round cycle thus began in 32 b.c. on 1 Ahau 1 Pop,
which fell on August 14.
• The projected Izapan New Year's Day in a.d. 2012 equals April 5 (4 Ahau 1
Pop), exactly 260 days before 13.0.0.0.0. However, this is just a New Year's
Day,- it is not the beginning of a Calendar Round.
• Most importantly, the Izapan haab date for December 21, 2012 a.d. is thus 1
Kankin.
My reconstruction is derived from a probable three-day haab shift from the
older Izapan calendar to the later Tikal calendar.10 Several compelling consider¬
ations emerge from my reconstruction. First, the Calendar Round beginning in 32
b.c. fell on August 14, very close to the second zenith passage at Izapa. In fact, it is
within the three-day range of zenith-passage observations at the latitude of Izapa.
That the New Calendar Round began on a zenith passage reminds us of the practice
among the pre-Conquest Yucatec Maya of using July 26 (a zenith-passage date at
their latitude) as their New Year's Day.
Projecting the Izapan calendar forward to 13.0.0.0.0 yields a haab date of 1
Kankin (rather than 3 Kankin in the later Tikal system). In that the haab number is
now 1, we can suspect that we have, in fact, found the original tzolkin-haab place¬
ment of the culture that created the Long Count—the Izapans. Following well
known linguistic meanings, my reading of this kan-kin month is broken down into:
• kan (or chan) = four, snake, sky, and cross (as in the "kan" cross)
• kin = day and sun
The meanings of these two words bring to mind the four directions or four
World Ages, the Milky Way snake, the celestial cross, and the sun—the key players
in the 13-baktun cycle end-date cosmology. Thus, appropriately, we can say that
the solstice sun enters the crossroads in the center of the sky, in the belly of the
Milky Way snake, on the haab day 1 Kankin: One “cross-day-sun. ’’ My recon¬
struction is based upon the principles of calendar transformations identified by
Munro Edmonson. At the very least, one important fact is exposed by this line of
questioning: Contrary to conventional academic wisdom, 3 Kankin was not the
haab date used by the creators of the Long Count for the end-date in 2012. And, if



248 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
my reconstruction of the Izapan Calendar Round is correct, the meaning of 1 Kankin
is very suggestive of the astronomical alignment that takes place on the end-date.
4 Ahau 1 Kankin, 13.0.0.0.0.
THE IZAPAN CALENDARS:
THE LONG COUNT AND THE TZOLKIN
The zenith intervals at Izapa define a kind of geodetic seasonal calendar in
which the solstices provide a primary axis. The implied intervals and zenith-pas¬
sage dates draw attention to the 260-day tzolkin cycle and the first and last days of
the 13-baktun cycle of the Long Count. My reconstruction of the Izapan Calendar
Round (the August 14 Calendar Round beginning in 32 b.c.) points to a key date in
the Long Count (its "first" day), which is also a zenith-passage date at Izapa. Fi¬
nally, the meaning of "1 Kankin" is very suggestive of the astronomical alignment
of the 2012 end-date.
In general, Izapa is clearly the origin place of the Long Count calendar, and
probably of the tzolkin calendar as well. Izapa was an incredible place of innova¬
tion, skywatching, visionary shamanism, and ingenious myth-making. The monu¬
mental legacy of Izapa comes down to us today as a reminder that we are approach¬
ing a critical World Age rebirth.
Michael Coe was of the opinion that "the Long Count itself might have been
the invention of one person."11 This is an astounding suggestion, but is mitigated
against when we consider that the Long Count must have been formulated over
centuries of tracking precessional motion. However, like Hipparchus in the Old
World, perhaps the final pieces of the puzzle were assembled by one intrepid Izapan
skywatcher. In his book Cycles of the Sun, Mysteries of the Moon, Vincent
Malmstrom argues for just such a scenario—that the Long Count was invented at
Izapa during the first millennium b.c. by one person, whom, ironically, he calls the
"New World Hipparchus."12 Despite Malmstrom's search for the astronomical un¬
derpinnings of the Izapan calendars, no mention was made in Malmstrom's book of
precession and its role in the Long Count end-date. We may never know if the Long
Count was the creation of one person or of a lineage of dedicated skywatchers en¬
gaged in calibrating precession over several centuries. However, Malmstrom's use
of the name Hipparchus, the name of the astronomer who discovered precession in
the ancient Greek world, is perfectly appropriate.



CHAPTER 21
IZAPAN ASTRONOMY AND
COSMOLOGY
T
he Izapan skywatchers were astronomers and calendar-priests. They also were
shamans, adept visionaries who undertook journeys into the cosmic center.
This specific concern of shamanism goes back thousands of years, to the Asian
forebears of the human beings who migrated into the Americas. The Neolithic sha¬
mans of Asia believed that the Pole Star was the cosmic center, and the Pole Star
was of great interest to them because, at northern latitudes, it is almost straight
overhead. Within the Tropics at Izapa, the ancient shamanistic concern with find¬
ing the center embraced more complex considerations, ones that forced New World
skywatchers to search for other possible cosmic centers, and determine which one
was true.
The monument orientations and alignments at Izapa reveal that Izapa's sha¬
man-astronomers recognized three cosmic centers. Viewed from Izapa, the North
Celestial Pole lies in the direction of Tacana volcano to the north, and since Izapa is
at a southerly latitude, the North Celestial Pole appears to be low in the sky. In
fact, the altitude of the North Celestial Pole is always equivalent to one's latitude
of observation. As such, at Izapa the North Celestial Pole is viewed 15° above the
northern horizon. The peak of Tacana is actually to the east of the North Celestial
Pole, but serves as a general indicator for the polar center (diagram 133).1
As viewed from Izapa, the circumpolar stars spin counterclockwise around the
249



250 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
polar center. As such, we can imag¬
ine the circumpolar constellations,
such as the Big Dipper, rising behind
Tacana, and we can understand the
importance of Tacana within Izapan
astronomy. Earlier, we saw how the
shallow cleft on Tacana's eastern slope
was mythologized as the primordial
"cleft" of Creation, which is spoken
of in the Popol Vuh and other Meso
american Creation myths.2 In the Po¬
pol Vuh, it is "the split place, the bro¬
ken water place" from which maize
and the Maize God were born. As a
birthplace, something is "born" or
emerges from the cleft. Clearly, the
Big Dipper, which we already know
corresponds to the Seven Macaw deity in the Popol Vuh, fits the bill. Thus, the
polar region, as marked by Tacana, was one cosmic center that the Izapans recog¬
nized and incorporated into their cosmological ideas.
Another cosmic center implicit in Izapa's cosmology is the zenith center, which
draws from the Mesoamerican interest in the center of the sky directly overhead.
As described earlier, Izapa's latitude demarcates a 260-day interval between solar
zenith-passage dates. Solar zenith passages were observed with vertical pillars such
as those found in Group B. Twice a year, rituals of ascension took place in which
the Izapan astronomer or shaman-priest journeyed into the cosmic center at the
moment the sun passed into the zenith. This no-shadow moment occurred at high
noon, 130 days before and after the December solstice. The zenith was thus an¬
other significant cosmic center recognized at Izapa.
A primary orientational axis at Izapa lies on a perpendicular to the north-south
baseline of the site. This is the southeast-northwest axis that corresponds to the
December solstice sunrise and the June solstice sunset (azimuth 114° vs. azimuth
294°). This axis points to the most mysterious and intriguing cosmic center indi¬
cated by Izapan alignments. Many monuments face the December solstice horizon,
and the pictographs on those stelae portray what occurs in that direction.

IZAPAN ASTRONOMY AND COSMOLOGY / 251
Imagine standing in the center of Izapa, perhaps on the top of the large temple
mound in Group H, in the predawn hours of a December solstice 2,100 years ago.
You look to the southeast. You see the sky begin to lighten, but it is not from the
rising sun. It is the shimmering stars of the Milky Way rising above the solstice
horizon, the bright central bulge of the Milky Way, the Womb of Creation. It is the
Great Mother and Creator of All. This, truly, is the birthplace of the sky-Earth; it is
the cosmic center from which everything is born. Soon after the Galaxy rises, the
solstice sun begins to make its presence known. The sky brightens, the cosmic womb/
center fades into light, and the New Year
begins. Given the astronomical fact that a
main axis at Izapa points directly at the Ga¬
lactic Center as it rises on the December
solstice, the Galactic Center within the
crossroads formed by the Milky Way and the
ecliptic was, undeniably, another cosmic
center recognized by Izapan cosmonauts.
The polar center, the zenith center, and
the Galactic Center: We must incorporate
all three of these cosmic centers into our
exploration of Izapan cosmology. As such,
we must deal with a complex cosmic map
system involving three axes and three cen¬
ters.
A monument from Kaminaljuyu sup¬
ports the idea that the ancient skywatchers
of southern Mesoamerica recognized three
levels of cosmic centers. We have seen the
close relationship between the art motifs
of Izapa and Kaminaljuyu. In addition, these
two Pre-Classic sites were the largest cities of their day, both playing an important
role in long-distance trade and regional ceremonies. Kaminaljuyu Monument 65 is
an astounding confirmation of the three-tiered cosmological model. Accepting that
the missing part contained an attendant, the monument shows three levels of en¬
throned cosmic rulers, each flanked by two attendants (see diagram 135).
As we saw earlier, thrones were symbols of the cosmic center, and here we
Diagram 134. 3-D Izapan axes: Zenith-Polar
Galactic. Adapted from Lowe etal.fl982: Fig.
4.11)



have three. I interpret this image as proof of a
Mesoamerican interest in three interfacing cosmic
centers: polar, zenith and Galactic. Seven ball
courts at Kaminaljuyu are oriented roughly to the
December solstice sunrise azimuth; three other
ballcourts are perpendicular to this azimuth and
therefore reflect the Tacana orientation at Izapa.
Because of these shared orientations, I believe that
the builders of Kaminaljuyu attempted to adopt
the complex cosmovision formalized earlier at
Izapa. At Izapa, Groups B and F both have promi¬
nently placed thrones; only Group A lacks a
throne. However, a corner fragment of a third
throne was, in fact, found at Izapa.3 It was recov¬
ered from a refuse dump near Group F, and may or
may not have originally been located in Group A. This throne's original location
remains unsolved, but the thrones in Groups B and F suggest that the three main
monument groups, as ceremonial representatives of their respective cosmic axes
and centers, each contained a throne. The Kaminaljuyu image of three tiers of thrones
is compelling and lends credence to my thesis of a three-level Izapan cosmovision,
but a clearer validation of Izapa's interest in three cosmic centers comes from ex¬
amining the astronomy associated with its three primary monument groups.
THE THREE COSMIC CENTERS IN A NORTH-SOUTH
FRAMEWORK
When we look at the timing of astronomical cycles that surrounded Izapa dur¬
ing its heyday (500 b.c.-a.d. 100), we will understand the importance of the three
cosmic centers. First, we can simplify this three-level model by considering how
the Izapans thought about space and geography. Fortunately, Izapan cosmology can
be boiled down into a generalized north-south framework.
Tacana lies to the north of Izapa, and symbolized the polar region. However,
with its peak ascending into the highest regions of the sky, Tacana also symbolized
the zenith. One wonders how Tacana could have represented both polar north and
the zenith. The answer to this dilemma is evident when we look carefully at recent
Diagram 135. Kaminaljuyu Monu¬ ment 65



IZAPAN ASTRONOMY AND COSMOLOGY / 253
breakthroughs in understanding Mesoamerican mapping systems. We find that the
northern cardinal direction (i.e., "north") was equivalent to "up" (the zenith direc¬
tion). In other words, the Mesoamericans did not view directions in the same way
that Europeans do, as abstract absolute concepts of north-south-east-west separated
by 90° around the horizon. Mayanist Clemency Coggins wrote an interesting ar¬
ticle called "The Zenith, the Mountain, the Center, and the Tree"4 that provides a
dualist framework for understanding Izapan cosmovision. She summarized the re¬
cent breakthroughs in understanding Mesoamerican directional concepts, remind¬
ing us that the vertical axis of zenith-nadir was associated in the minds of
Mesoamerican thinkers with the topographical axis of north-south: North is equiva¬
lent to "up" (the sky) whereas south is equivalent to "down" (the direction of the
Underworld). In Mesoamerican thought, the zenith is the fifth, central direction,
and is thus also "up." As such, both polar north and the zenith belong to the con¬
ceptual category of "north." At Izapa, the December solstice direction to the south
occupies the conceptual category "south"—north is the sky and south is the Un¬
derworld. Remember, too, that the Galactic Center, which rises along the Decem¬
ber solstice horizon to the south, is near the Road to the Underworld, and, again,
south is the direction of the Underworld. Here we see how the three cosmic centers
fit into a basic north-south framework.5
In the Popol Vuh/Hero Twin Creation myth that appears on Izapan stelae, the
primordial world prior to the first World Age consisted solely of sky above and
Earth below. In other words, the underlying frame¬
work of space and time was conceived as an up-down
or north-south polarity. The Popol Vuh goes on to state
that the world began with a dialogue between the sky
above and the ocean below, a basic doctrine clearly
present at Izapa. In support of this notion of a dia¬
logue between opposed conceptual categories, Izapa
Stela 25 reveals a north-south polarity between the
Big Dipper (polar center) and the Milky Way's dark
rift (Galactic Center).
The manmade pole Hunahpu holds serves to iden¬
tify the conceptual north-south axis. I believe Stela
25 portrays the sky at midnight on the December sol¬
stice in era 100 b.c. The bird at the top is the Big Dip
Diagram 136. Izapa Stela 25, a

per (in the "north"). The inverted caiman monster on the left is the Milky Way,
whose head represents the Galactic Bulge, far below the Earth at midnight (farthest
"south"). Thus, Stela 25 depicts the opposition between sky (north) and ocean (south),
and we can deduce that Izapan cosmologists were interested in the dialogue that
occurs between the astronomical movements of the Big Dipper and the Milky Way.
As we will see, this dialogue is nothing less than the Creation myth dialogue be¬
tween the old Polar God (Seven Macaw/Big Dipper)
and the new Galactic God (One Hunahpu/Decem
ber solstice sun). In sum, Izapa's north-south
cosmovision manifests in the dialogue between the
northern "centers" (polar and zenith) versus the
southern "center" (the Galactic Center, located by
the dark-rift and the cross formed by the Milky Way
and the ecliptic in Sagittarius).6
One more consideration: The zenith has no ho¬
rizon. As such, when looking for astronomical rise
events along the horizon, as we must do to under¬
stand Izapan horizon astronomy, we are limited to
the polar north and the solstice south. What is actu¬
ally going on, astronomically, in these directions? First, let us look at the astronomy
to the polar north.
As sketched earlier, the 23° azimuth baseline of Izapa Group B points not to
the Tacana peak, but to a place 2° down the eastern flank, where we find a shallow
cleft. As previously mentioned, this feature in the silhouette of Tacana is highly
significant, and is related to the Olmec motif of a cleft-head deity. For the Olmec,
the sacred volcano of the north was San Martin Pajapan, and artifacts and sculp¬
tures found in this volcano's crater demonstrate that offerings were made there to
the Fire God (a very ancient First Father deity). Furthermore, the crater on top of
San Martin was probably understood to represent the Creation cleft, the origin place
of corn mentioned in the Popol Vuh as "the broken place, the bitter water place,"
which is an apt description of a volcanic crater.7 The Solar/Maize Deity was thought
to have been born from this place. The Maya Witznal deity often has a stepped or
cleft forehead, and was probably derived from the older Olmec symbology. Further¬
more, a cleft-head motif is very common in Olmec art, and corn is usually shown
sprouting from it.
Diagram 137. North-south cen¬
ters in Izapan cosmovision



. . IZAPAN ASTRONOMY AND COSMOLOGY / 255
The Tacana cleft likely partook of Olmec Creation symbology, and thus the
Izapan alignments to it are not surprising. This particular cleft also is near a moun¬
tain pass (a minor trade route into the highlands) and thus symbolizes a literal
portal from one zone to another, recalling the symbolic associations involving caves
and Otherworld portals. Emergence
motifs surround this cave-cleft symbol
complex,8 and it is certainly no coinci¬
dence that, around era 300 b.c., the Big
Dipper rose along the eastern flank of
Tacana where this cleft is located.9
My discovery of the Big Dipper's
emergence through the Tacana cleft,
though critical to understanding the
message of Izapa's monuments, has yet
to be recognized in studies of Izapa. Af¬
ter exploring the Big Dipper's move¬
ments with astronomy software, I rec¬
ognized a pattern that highlights sol¬
stice dates as being significant in the
Big Dipper's "cycle of emergence." On
the December solstice during era 100
b.c., the sun set in the southwest (its
furthest southward set), and as the rays of the setting sun dissipated, attention
turned to the north, where the Big Dipper's star, Dubhe, was seen rising over Tacana
peak. Next, the Big Dipper's star Merak rose near the Tacana cleft, followed by the
other stars in the Big Dipper.
In the diagram, we can see how the Big Dipper appeared to rise through the
Tacana cleft more than 2,100 years ago, which is exactly what the Izapan skywatchers
would have seen. The Big Dipper rose at sunset and set at sunrise on the December
solstice, which means that it was visible for the entire night. The December sol¬
stice was thus a time when the Big Dipper was in a strong, ascending, and fully
present place. In comparison, the sun on the December solstice was conceived of as
weak and on the verge of death and rebirth. Six months later, the tables were turned.
During the June solstice, the sun was "strongest," most fully present. At this time,
the Big Dipper rose at dawn and thus was not visible at all throughout the night.10
Diagram 138. The Big Dipper rising through the
Tacana cleft after sundown on the December sol¬
stice of 100 b.c., viewed from Izapa



256 / MAYA COSMOG E N E 5 I S 2012
Clearly, some kind of mythic story—or dialogue—was woven around these astro¬
nomical movements.
Next, let us look at the astronomy to the south, along the December solstice
horizon. As a result of Group B's 23° azimuth baseline to the Tacana cleft, the
perpendicular southeastward orientation of Izapa points to the December solstice
sunrise, meaning that many of Izapa's carved monuments face the December sol¬
stice horizon, as if paying homage to it. The astronomical players on that horizon
are the Galactic Center, the Milky Way, the crossroads, the dark-rift, and the De¬
cember solstice sun. This place and time is, like the Big Dipper's emergence through
the "cleft" in the north, also meaningful as a "birth" place. For one, the December
solstice is when the sun dies and is reborn from the Underworld, to begin its phase
of increasing daylight. Secondly, as I have explored throughout this book and in
previous publications,11 the dark-rift "cleft" in the Milky Way rose two hours be¬
fore the December solstice sun in era 100 b.c. The dark-rift is the portal to the
Otherworld, the celestial cave leading into the Heart of Sky, and the birth canal of
the Great Mother (the Milky Way). The Milky Way's cleft in the south is, as men¬
tioned earlier, conceptually analogous to the Tacana cleft in the north. Both are
emergence places, and both involve competing deities or cosmic centers: polar ver¬
sus Galactic,- north versus south.
I feel it was a primary interest of Izapan skywatchers to compare the north and
south emergence places, to derive a mythological dialogue between the two deities
involved—the Big Dipper (Seven Macaw) versus the December solstice sun (One
Hunahpu/First Father). This mythic dialogue plays itself out in the Popol Vuh battle
between the avenging sons of the Solstice Deity and Seven Macaw (the Big Dipper
Polar Deity). Ultimately, what we find encoded in this epic story, if we read be¬
tween the lines, is the demise of the old Polar God of the Olmec, who is replaced by
the Galactic God and the associated end-date cosmology. Here we catch another
glimpse of the true meaning of the Hero Twin story.
To recap, the astronomical process in the north is twofold: The ascent of the sun
into the zenith, occurring twice a year, signaled key events in the Izapan calendar
and agricultural year. However, the zenith center is unique in that it has no associ¬
ated horizon along which astronomical events occur. The other cosmic center of the
north—the North Celestial Pole—is where significant mythic astronomy occurs. The
Big Dipper rose through the Tacana cleft at sundown on the December solstice. This
northern emergence was mirrored by rise events in the south. The cleft of Creation



IZAPAN ASTRONOMY AND COSMOLOGY / 257
in the south is the dark-rift in the Milky Way, and the Milky Way itself was thought
of, on one level, as the great fount of Creation, conceptually identical to the Tacana
volcano as a Creation place. In this way, the astronomical “emergences" in the north
and south reflect each other. The astronomical players are different, but were under¬
stood to symbolize similar functions. The Big Dipper rose through (or was born from)
the Tacana cleft. In comparison, the December solstice sun was projected to rise
through (or be born from) the dark-rift cleft of the Milky Way. These astronomical
facts will be the keys to interpreting Izapa's monuments and cosmology.
Notice that the convergence of the solstice sun with its rebirth place (the dark
rift) is not an annual event. It takes place over thousands of years because it is
caused by precession. If the north-south model is to hold true, precession also must
be involved in the north and somehow impart effects on the Big Dipper. And it
does. Here we enter into profound esoteric territory. The Izapan calendar-priests
now appear as incredibly advanced astronomers and cosmologists, human beings
who were far beyond what we have so far imagined. They were innovative visionar¬
ies who, as we will see in Chapter 23, also were very interested in initiating seekers
into their profound discoveries.
THE NORTH-SOUTH DIALOGUE AT
THE LEVEL OF PRECESSION
There is something else going on with the
astronomy of the northern direction, and it in¬
volves precession. Here we must look at Izapan
astronomy as it manifests on the level of World
Ages. The Izapan skywatchers were tuned into
vast cycles of time, and so were interested in
the effects of precession. In this book, I have
explored the meaning of the astronomical align¬
ment that culminates on the Long Count end
date, which involves the December solstice sun
converging with the Galactic Center near the
dark-rift in the Milky Way. To the Izapan as- Diagram 139. The Milky Way’s move¬

the astronomy of this event and in calibrating its precession-caused convergence.
Within the Izapan dialogical cosmovision, this event happened in "the south" and
was somehow opposed to the Big Dipper's movement in the north. The slow ap¬
proach of the solstice sun occurred at a consistent rate, because it occurred along the
ecliptic. Precessional change along the ecliptic
underwent a steady rate of slippage amounting to
one degree every 71.5 years. However, the stars
around the North Celestial Pole experienced vari¬
able rates of precession-caused change.12 The rea¬
son can be understood by examining this diagram.
The circle indicates the changing position of
the North Celestial Pole over its 26,000-year pre¬
cessional cycle. The years shown around the circle
indicate where the North Celestial Pole was lo¬
cated during the epoch given. Picture the Big Dip¬
per revolving around the North Celestial Pole of
3000 b.c.; then in 1000 b.c.; and a.d. 2000—and
notice how the precession of the North Celestial
Pole changes the orientation of the Big Dipper.
Take note of something else, too. Between 3000 b.c. and 1000 b.c. the Big Dip¬
per, as a unit, remained uniformly close to the North Celestial Pole. For almost
2,000 years the Big Dipper hung close to the polar region.13 After 1000 b.c., and
increasingly after 600 b.c., the body of the Big Dipper began appearing to move away
from the North Celestial Pole faster and faster. The effect is that of the Big Dipper
hightailing it away from his polar roost after 1000 b.c.! This phenomenon was
undoubtably tracked through a continuity of star lore collected and passed down by
the earliest inhabitants of Izapa. But what might the Izapans have thought about
this movement? Given that it involved the region in which the ancient Polar God
resided, they must have been rather alarmed. Could this be the astronomical basis
of the Popol Vuh myth of Seven Macaw falling out of his roost—being evicted rather
abruptly from his ancient perch in the Heart of Heaven? This is a perfect example of
how precessional astronomy and Izapan mythology were merged, and our attention
is drawn to examine Izapa's monuments. An altar from Izapa shows Seven Macaw,
the Big Dipper Polar God, sitting on his polar perch (see diagram 141).



IZAPAN ASTRONOMY AND COSMOLOGY / 259
Diagram 141. Izapa Altar 20:
Seven Macaw on his polar
perch
Notice that his wings are not outstretched. He is
not flying, or carrying a seed or the sun. He is just sit¬
ting on his perch, supplicated by the priest below. The
"fall" of Seven Macaw, a key event in the closing of
the previous World Age as testified to in the Maya Cre¬
ation myth, involved his separation and increasing dis¬
tance from his ancient polar home. Clearly, the astro¬
nomical divergence that began occurring around 1000
b.c. explains the disqualification and falsity of Seven
Macaw/Big Dipper—he literally had a falling out from
his status as the true avatar of the cosmic center. Ac¬
cordingly, the Izapans must have concluded that the
entire polar center was "false." In terms of astronomy, this is absolutely true. Though
the sky is observed to revolve around the North Celestial Pole, it is not really the
center of the sky. Or rather, it appears to be, but only from a limited perspective.
Nor is it the cosmic source from which everything springs, although its diehard
followers may falsely proclaim it to be. In fact, the cult of the Polar God may have
survived in Mesoamerica for many centuries, its proponents irrationally holding
on to erroneous half-truths. This unfortunate development, what we might call the
evolution of Mesoamerican religious movements, mirrors the megalomania attrib¬
uted to Seven Macaw/Big Dipper in the Popol Vuh. He believed that everything
revolved around him,- he was the vain and false ruler of the previous World Age, and
the bearers of the new cosmology had to eject him from his high office to make
room for the Galactic God of Precession, One Hunahpu. The Popol Vuh muses that
the wooden people who lived during Seven Macaw's reign were so stiff and unfeel¬
ing (stuck as they were on the pole) that their tools rose up and destroyed them. It
appears, then, that the Popol Vuh encodes hidden dimensions of the evolution of
Mesoamerican cosmology, and warns us against believing in false gods. The Izapans
were on to something.
The process by which the Big Dipper falls away from the North Celestial Pole
continues for many millennia. Ultimately, the Big Dipper will be some 65° away
from the North Celestial Pole in era a.d. 11,400. This means that 9,400 years from
now the Big Dipper will share the same rise azimuth as the June solstice sun! The
Big Dipper's changing rise azimuths during this journey through one-half of a pre¬
cession cycle look like the following diagram:14

Tajumulco and the June solstice sunrise
The ultimate twelfth-millennium rise place of the Big Dipper is made even
more significant when we consider the topography surrounding Izapa. By a.d. 11,400
the Big Dipper will rise almost directly over Tajumulco. On the June solstice, the
sun will still rise over Tajumulco, but some twelve hours after the Big Dipper,
resulting in a beautiful counterpoint effect. The Big Dipper will have achieved an
opposed synchronization with the June solstice sun—they will share the same ris¬
ing azimuth, but will rise twelve hours apart. After era a.d. 11,400, the Big Dipper
will begin to close distance with the North Celestial Pole once again.
The Big Dipper was closest to the North Celestial Pole between 3000 b.c. and
1000 b.c. Afterward, the Big Dipper's time as regent of the cosmic center came to an
end, and its "descent" began. The slow advance of the Big Dipper through eons of
time is pictured in diagram 143.
Notice the changing declination of the Big Dipper as precession moves it fur¬
ther away from the North Celestial Pole. Ultimately, the Big Dipper's southern¬
most declination in era a.d. 11,400 will coincide with the sun's declination on the
June solstice—the day of the sun's northernmost declination. Whether or not the
Izapans were aware of this particular far-future event, the convergence suggests a
cosmic meeting of ancient deities.
Clearly, precession affects the Big Dipper and its relation to the polar center of
the north. And the astronomy fits precisely into the Creation story preserved at

cally, Seven Macaw started rapidly falling away from his polar perch beginning
around 1000 b.c. Translating this back into astronomy, the Big Dipper's distance
from the North Celestial Pole did, in fact, start to increase rapidly at this time. This
era of rapidly increasing change also fits perfectly into the transformative period in
Mesoamerican history during which the Olmec faded and the Maya began to emerge,
armed with a new cosmological knowledge. But their new knowledge came only
after the Izapans looked in the other direction, the south, where the future installa

tion of the next World Age ruler, One Hunahpu, was observed and calibrated over
the December solstice horizon. Given that the new cosmic center of the new cos¬
mology was the Galactic Center, the Izapans, truly, were on to something big.
The amazing precessional cosmology discovered and fine-tuned at Izapa can be
summed up as follows:
• North: The Big Dipper's flight or "fall" away from North Celestial Pole to¬
ward the June solstice, beginning around 1000 b.c. In terms of horizon topog¬
raphy, the movement is from one sacred volcano (Tacana) toward another
(Tajumulco).
• South: The December solstice sun's flight or "birth" through the dark-rift
cave in the Milky Way. Or, from a different perspective, the "fall" of the
Milky Way toward the December solstice horizon. This convergence culmi¬
nates in a.d. 2012, 13.0.0.0.0 in the Long Count calendar.
To summarize our exploration of Izapan astronomy, a complex three-direc¬
tional model has been identified. The three directions or axes of Izapan cosmovision
each points to its own cosmic center, and these three domains belong to a basic
north-south framework. The zenith-passage dates are clearly significant in Izapan
astronomy, as are the two solstice dates, and the astronomical features that make a
hard-to-ignore appearance on these dates include the Milky Way, the dark-rift, the
Big Dipper, the solstice sun, and, of course, the zenith sun. These clues are what we
need to confidently approach the Izapan monuments with some hope of correct
interpretation. We should be prepared to meet the challenge set by the complex
multilevel cosmovision we have already decoded.
In this book, especially in Part II, I explored a precession-caused alignment in
both the zenith center and the Galactic Center. And now we see that a similar
precession-caused movement occurs in relation to that other cosmic center, the
North Celestial Pole. In the same way that Quetzalcoatl was identified as the deity
of the Zenith Cosmology and One Hunahpu was identified as the deity of the Ga¬
lactic Cosmology, we can identify Seven Macaw as the deity of the Polar Cosmol¬
ogy. Each deity moves toward (or, in the case of Seven Macaw, away) from a cosmic
throne, which Mesoamerican philosophers recognized as a cosmic center. I feel
that the most important of the three cosmic centers, and the one best represented
in Izapan cosmology, is the one identified by the 13-baktun cycle end-date: the



IZAPAN ASTRONOMY AND COSMOLOGY / 263
Galactic Center. Given that the new cosmology formulated at Izapa was oriented
toward this cosmic center, I suggest that we consider this the ultimate secret of the
Izapan Mysteries as we examine the monuments. It will be the key to interpreting
the fascinating but nearly inscrutible monument arrangements in Group F. Now
we have ventured into completely unknown cosmological territory, discovering
nothing less than a lost Galactic paradigm. The profound cosmic understanding
that gave rise to the Long Count calendar is, after lying buried for almost three
baktuns, finally yielding its secrets.

CHAPTER 22
THE MONUMENTAL MESSAGE
T
he Izapan monuments contain mythic dramas, tantalizing adventures recog¬
nizable as the Hero Twin Creation story. Given the astronomical interests of
the Izapans, it is no surprise that the Hero Twin story is a metaphor for astronomi¬
cal events, and that the key to understanding it involves recognizing that the monu¬
ments of Izapa, upon which the Hero Twin myth is preserved, reflect astronomical
events occurring along the horizons toward which they are oriented. Here we re¬
cover the lost half of the Hero Twin myth, the astronomical events that up until
now have been obscure.
The primary Izapan monument groups can be located in diagram 144.
Since Izapan cosmology involves three cosmic centers and axes, I have chosen
to simply identify monument meanings based on their relationship to these three
axes: polar north, zenith, and solstice south. (Since the December solstice horizon
is where the Milky Way/ecliptic crossroads rose during the Izapan era, the solstice
axis points to the great central bulge in the Galaxy and thus can be considered to be
the Galactic Center indicator.) As such, we can categorize the symbolic content of
Izapa's monuments under the following three cosmic centers:
• The Polar Center. The monuments of Group A contain the message of the
ascent and descent of Seven Macaw to the north—the rise and fall of the Big
Dipper around Tacana and the North Celestial Pole.
• The Zenith Center. Group B, with its zenith gnomons, Throne 1, and Stela 9,
265



266 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
was clearly the ceremonial section of Izapa in which the zenith center was
worshiped. Throne 1 contains complex astronomical information demarcat¬
ing zenith-passage days, with the zenith at the center.
• The Galactic Center. The Group F ballcourt, oriented to the December sol¬
stice horizon, contains thrones and monuments that describe the astronomical
convergence occurring in that direction—the convergence of the Milky Way
and the solstice sun that will culminate on 13.0.0.0.0. Stela 11 from Group B
and the two stelae from Group E face the same horizon and reinforce this
message.
Each of the three monument groups refers to a specific cosmic center. How¬
ever, certain monuments in a given group may refer to a different cosmic center,
because the different centers were interrelated in Izapan
thought. In other words, though each group has its pri¬
mary reference to a specific cosmic center, the other two
cosmic centers also were incorporated into each group's
message because the centers mirror each other. The my¬
thology encoded in the monuments was concerned with a
dialogue between the centers. For example, Group A pri¬
marily contains information about the Big Dipper (Seven
Macaw) to the north. However, Stela 27, on the eastern
side of Group A, is the only monument in that group that
faces the December solstice horizon.
It portrays an inverted caiman-tree, a symbol identi¬
fied by Maya scholars as the Milky Way. As such, though
Group A's primary concern is with the polar center, Stela
27 is a reminder of the Galactic Center that rises to the
southeast.
Likewise, Group F primarily describes the solar con¬
vergence with the Galactic Center along the December
solstice horizon. The Group F ballcourt itself, pointing to the Milky Way and the
dark-rift, symbolizes the Milky Way. And yet Stela 60 is placed prominently in the
Group F ballcourt, and it shows a victorious ballplayer standing over a fallen Seven
Macaw. This seems to be a reminder that the Galactic convergence cannot occur
unless the Polar God has been defeated. In general then, we should be aware that all
Diagram 145. Stela 21, a

THE MONUMENTAL MESSAGE / 267
of the monuments in a given group do not exclusively portray the same cosmic
center. Having said that, it remains clear that each group has a primary association
with one of the three cosmic centers.
GROUP B: HOMAGE TO THE ZENITH GOD
Group B contains a large northward-facing temple, called Mound 30a, in which
archaeologists found many offering caches. Like other Mesoamerican temples, its
very form encodes the quadrated cosmogram with the zenith in the center. The
northward-facing platform in Group B is the primary focus of the plaza's monu¬
ments. Although there are platforms to the east, west, and south, only the northern
and western platforms contain carved monuments. The western platform contains
Stelae 11, 12, and 50, which face the December solstice sunrise and the Galactic
Center; they appear to make a sepa¬
rate Statement about that cosmic cen- Diagram 146. Group B: The Zenith Group. From Lowe
ter, and we will look at them in de- etal- (1982:178)
tail later. The primary ritual focus of
Group B is along the line formed by
Throne 1, the pillar-and-ball monu¬
ment directly in front of Throne 1,
the large Stela 9 (flanked by Stelae 8
and 10), and the Stela 24/Altar 20
combo on the main platform.
The three pillar-and-ball monu¬
ments most likely were used to iden¬
tify the date of the solar zenith pas¬
sage. These are vertical gnomons that
cast no shadows at high noon on the
zenith-passage days, and the ball on
top symbolizes the sun on top of the
cosmic zenith axis.1 Throne 1 is in¬
credibly interesting, as it has five
glyphs along its edges and a crossband
on its flat upper throne surface:
Notice in diagram 147 that the

Diagram 147. Throne 1: Glyph arrangements,

five glyphs are all basically the same.
They are deity faces, used as directional
placemarkers similar to the directional
chacs of the Yucatec Maya. The cross¬
bands that are found on most Mesoamer
ican thrones symbolize the cosmic cen¬
ter from which the king-shaman rules,
and Izapa Throne 1 is no exception. Re¬
member, Mesoamerican king-shamans
were enthroned upon the cosmic center
and cultivated their power by periodically
journeying into it. The specific cosmic center represented by the crossbands de¬
pends upon the context. Here, the crossband design represents the Mesoamerican
zenith cosmogram: The corners are the four solstice rise and set positions, and the
center represents the zenith. Thus, Throne 1 is the king-shaman's seat in the ze¬
nith center.
Throne 1 provides another clue that Group B represents the zenith center: Only
three of the five glyphs around the edge of Throne 1 accurately correspond to the
quadrated scheme. The two glyphs

tional glyphs on Throne 1
on the south corners refer to the
December solstice sunrise and sun¬
set positions—the solstice south di¬
rection. The center glyph on the
south edge refers to the center di¬
rection—the zenith direction also
indicated by the crossbands on the upper surface.2 Significantly, the two glyphs
along the east and west edges are not quite on the back corners,- they are only about
four-fifths of the way back. If we look at the eastern horizon sunrise in diagram
148, we get a clue as to what these two glyphs probably represent.
In the diagram, notice where the zenith sun rises in relation to the two solstice
sunrises—about four-fifths of the way in between. As a result, it is fairly clear that
the two glyphs on the east and west edges of Throne 1 represent sunrise and sunset
on the solar zenith-passage dates. (The horizon positions for both the May and Au¬
gust zenith-passage dates are the same.) So, Throne 1 actually encodes a great deal
of cosmological information.

Throne 1 's encoded information:
a) December solstice sunrise
b) December solstice sunset
c) Zenith-passage date sunrise

nomical information (N =

The crossband on Throne 1 reinforces the notion of a quadrated universe based
upon the solstice axes, a cosmo-conception that we first encountered in Izapa's
solstice orientation. The crossbands conform to the rectangular shape of the throne
stone itself. The five glyphs around the edge, however, provide additional informa¬
tion by way of their offset positions. Two of them are at the corners, and therefore
represent the December solstice rise-set, which occurs in the south. Three of them
refer to zenith events (one to sunrise on the zenith-passage date, one to noon on the
zenith-passage date, and one to sunset on the zenith-passage date). This glyph-trip¬
let is replicated by the three nearby pil
lar-and-ball gnomons, closely associated
with Throne 1.
In all probability, the center-front
pillar-and-ball zenith gnomon corre¬
sponds to the center-front glyph on the
south edge of Throne 1 (both symbolize
the sun in the zenith). The glyph on the
left or west edge of Throne 1, together
with the western pillar-and-ball gno¬
mon, refers to sunset on the zenith-pas
sage days. The glyph on the east edge of
Throne 1, together with the eastward
pillar-and-ball gnomon, refers to sunrise
on the zenith-passage days.

gnomons, with Stelae 8, 9, and 10



270 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
Stelae 8, 9, and 10 are directly in front of the pillar
and-ball throne-glyph triad, and the center stela in this
group is Stela 9. This stela depicts a solar deity carrying
a human figure up into the zenith, symbolizing the vi¬
sion quest undertaken by the priest-ruler who sits on
Throne 1. He has successfully invoked his celestial
naguales (spirit helpers), who now carry him into the
cosmic center, in this case, the zenith.
Stela 9 is flanked by Stelae 8 and 10, both of which
contain a vertical polarity. The general up-down polar¬
ity is most clear on Stela 8, in which the upper and lower
frames are enclosed within squarish or quadrated boxes.
Some kind of frog or caiman beast unites the upper and
lower scenes, and the lower scene shows a human figure sitting on a throne, framed
in the quadrated Underworld symbol.3 This cross-marked throne-spot is in the belly
of the Stela 8 beast, reinforcing the idea
that the throne-sitting ruler is in the
cosmic center (in Maya thought, the
belly of a cosmic monster represents the
center of the Underworld). Because of
the solar connotation of the zenith pas¬
sage, the throne-sitting figure on Stela
8 must be a solar ruler or earthly repre¬
sentative of the sun. Unfortunately,
most of the upper scene on Stela 8 has
chipped off. What remains is a squared
scene near the upturned mouth of the
Stela 8 frog-caiman monster. The ser¬
rated edge within the squared frame is
similar to the serrated pattern around the Throne 1 crossbands, suggesting the
Otherworld and sacred center concepts. Some kind of up-down parallelism seems
intended on Stela 8, which confirms the north-south model adopted by Izapan cos
mologists.
According to V. Garth Norman, the upper frame of Stela 8 contains a strange
creature, possibly a bee. Interestingly, bees can signal the zenith-passage day be

THE MONUMENTAL MESSAGE / 271
cause when they leave their hives at high noon on zenith-passage days, they are
directionally disoriented. They navigate by orienting themselves to the sun, and
when it is in the zenith they are confused. Finally, the surviving serration device on
Stela 8 also resembles the design surrounding the Solar Lord on Stela 67 in Group F,
which portrays the sun in the center of the Milky Way canoe. As such, its usage on
Stela 8 probably reflects the same meaning as the quadrated cartouche below it,
saying, in effect, "this is happening in a cosmic center."
In general, Stela 8 embodies a dialogue between womb and mouth, each repre¬
senting a cosmic center, and the two competing centers share the implied mythic
reading of both "womb" and "mouth." Why? The conjuring or "womb-birthing"
that occurs on Throne 1 refers to the zenith center. The upturned frog-caiman (with
its mouth open) means "to be born" or "date initiation." Thus, the upper frame of
Stela 8 suggests both birthing and swallowing, womb and mouth. The lower frame
is in the belly or stomach of the beast. The throne within the belly seems to imply
that this is the location of another cosmic center, one in the south, one in the belly
of the beast (the Milky Way's central bulge or womb). This cosmic womb is the
caldron of Creation, observed as the "fat" part of the Milky Way near the dark-rift.
And the dark-rift is the birth canal of the Great Mother. Thus, our examination so
far yields a dialogue between two cosmic centers, one in the north (the zenith) and
one in the south (Galactic).
Moving to Stela 10, to the right of Stela 9, we see a caiman-tree deity uniting
the upper and lower scenes. The entire scene, as previously mentioned, depicts the
pregnancy of Blood Moon, mother of the Hero Twins. Connected to her womb via
an umbilical rope, we see the Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque. She rests against
the caiman-tree, and a similar caiman-tree on Stela 27 in Group A has a quadrated
cartouche in its midsection, much like the one we just saw on lower Stela 8. The
upper branches of the caiman-tree on Stela 10 billow into cloud scrolls, similar to
the ones used to portray the Central Mexican Milky Way deity, Mixcoatl. The hu¬
man figure caught up in these star clouds of the Milky Way is One Hunahpu, father
of the Hero Twins. In the Popol Vuh, he hangs in a crook in the sacred calabash tree
and impregnates Blood Moon below with the Hero Twins. Recalling that the crook
of the calabash tree that stands by the road is the dark-rift in the Milky Way, we
have a statement here of a cosmic center—the Galactic Center. Like the ascending
figure on Stela 9, on Stela 10 First Father is in a cosmic center—the big, fat, fertile
part of the Milky Way that marks the Galactic Center.



272 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
Earlier, in the zenith symbology of Throne 1 and its related pillar-and-ball gno¬
mons, we identified the zenith as Group B's preferred cosmic center. This identifi¬
cation was confirmed on Stela 9, where a deity figure is being carried into the ze¬
nith. However, here on the neighboring Stela 10, a similar deity figure has ascended
into the billowing clouds of the Milky Way's center. The center of the Milky Way
is, in fact, located near the place where One Hunahpu's head was hung, at the cos¬
mic crossroads formed by the Milky Way and the ecliptic near Sagittarius, where
the dark-rift "crook of the calabash tree" is located. This is where the billows of the
Milky Way are brightest and thickest. Recalling that the Milky Way was some¬
times viewed as a snake, the image evokes a pregnancy. Furthermore, the snake
metaphor suggests a deeper interpretation of this symbology. Snakes are clearly
bloated right after ingesting a meal, suggesting devouring, and the idea arises that
birth and death are related processes. A conceptual similarity between snakes'
mouths and human birthing is evident when we understand that a woman's cervix
"unhinges" while she is giving birth, just like a snake's mouth can while it is de¬
vouring something. The Maya were no doubt aware of these parallels that are also
evident, as sketched above, in the womb-mouth polarity of Stela 8. A sophisticated
philosophy of creation and destruction as being two sides of the same coin is nicely
merged in this Izapan snake metaphor for the Milky Way.
The stelae we just examined all contain a vertical duality, confirming the north
south framework already identified as a fundamental tenet of Izapan cosmology.
Stela 11, on the west platform, also contains an up-down polarity. Stelae 11 and 8
both depict an up-ended caiman-frog with a quadrated form in their "stomachs."
On Stela 11 it is a crossband, symbolizing the cross of the Milky Way and ecliptic
towards which it faces; on Stela 8 it is the quadrated cartouche. Both stelae appear
to have an important upper scene in which something (a solar deity on Stela 11) is
being born from the deity's mouth. We will explore Stela 11 in more detail in a later
section of this chapter.
These comparisons demonstrate the interweaving nature of Izapan mythol¬
ogy. Some motifs are almost interchangeable, because they refer to the same cos¬
mological concept—the cosmic center. We cannot leave Group B without mention¬
ing Altar 20, which lies on the main north-south axis with Throne 1 and Stela 9.
The stela associated with Altar 20 is almost completely obliterated, but seems
to show a standing human figure. The bird deity on Altar 20 resembles the one on
Stela 25, who, as we saw, is Seven Macaw, the Big Dipper. The Altar 20 image often



THE MONUMENTAL MESSAGE / 273
has been mistakenly interpreted as a bird carrying a fruit to a beckoning person. But
this bird is not in flight; its wings are not outstretched. Instead, Seven Macaw is
depicted here perched upon the North Celestial Pole around which he revolves.
The human figure on Altar 20 is worshiping or making an offering to Seven Macaw,
as would happen on this northward-facing altar. In other words, it appears that
offerings were made to a specific constellation, what we call today the Big Dipper.
In addition, basal panels like the one on this altar portray a bar-and-two-dots "7",
reinforcing the identification of this bird deity as Seven Macaw because there are
seven stars in the Big Dipper. As mentioned earlier, proof
of the identification of Seven Macaw with the Big Dip¬
per comes from solid ethnographic data.4
We should remember that the Big Dipper rose out
of the cleft on Tacana's eastern flank, most notably af¬
ter sundown on the December solstice in era 100 b.c.
This opposed the sun's "rising" or "birth" through the
cleft of the Milky Way in the south. So, it is not surpris¬
ing that the third cosmic center portrayed in Group B is
the polar center. Altar 20 depicts the polar center as
Seven Macaw sitting on his polar perch. However, the
pole and the zenith both belong to the same category of
"north" whereas the Milky Way/ecliptic cross near the Galactic Center is in the
"south." Overall, the various stelae in Group B attempt to demonstrate, by way of
complementary analogy, the reversible unity of the north-south Izapan cosmology.
Though Izapan cosmovision boils down to a north-south opposition, we should
remember that three cosmic centers are involved. These different centers were syn¬
thesized into one mythic whole in the multilevel cosmic consciousness attained at
Izapa. However, because of the centrality and prominence of Throne 1, Stela 9, and
related pillar-and-ball monuments, Group B was primarily arranged to celebrate
the zenith axis and the zenith center as a destination of Izapan astronomer-priests.

GROUP A: THE POLAR GOD'S DEMISE
Group A, to the west of the main Group H baseline, contains many of Izapa's
most iconographically compelling stelae. This group is comprised of four platforms,
oriented north-south or toward the December solstice. All of the carved monu



274 / MAYA COSMOG E N E 5 I S
merits in Group A, except one,
are at the north or south plat¬
forms. The exception, Stela 27,
is in front of the east platform and
is oriented to the December sol¬
stice horizon.
Stela 27 is clearly in league
with the Group B references to
the December solstice end-date
alignment. On this stela, we see
an inverted caiman-tree that con¬
tains a quadrated cartouche sym¬
bolizing the Sacred Tree "cross¬
roads" of the Milky Way and the
ecliptic. If Izapa was a center of
learning and initiation, as I will
argue later, then Stela 27 may
have served to introduce the
Izapan initiate to the idea that
there was more than one cosmic
center. As such, Group A may
have been the first group visited
during initiation into the ancient Diagram 154. Group A monuments. From Lowe et al.
Izapan Mysteries. (1982:158)
The primary north-south
monuments of Group A tell of the circumpolar adventures of
the Big Dipper bird deity, Seven Macaw. The north platform
contains a row of five stelae, including Stela 25 and Stela 5.
The altar associated with Stela 7 depicts Seven Macaw in up¬
ward flight.
Stela 5 is probably one of the oldest monuments at Izapa,
dating to about 300 b.c., and was called a "supernarrative" by
V. Garth Norman in his compendious 1976 analysis of Izapan
stelae. Volumes could be written about this carving, but I will
limit our exploration to a few basic themes.
Diagram 155. Altar 3.

ward flight



THE MONUMENTAL MESSAGE / 275
There is a sky panel at the top, water scrolls at
the bottom, and a central Sacred Tree (probably rep¬
resenting Tacana and/or the Milky Way) connect¬
ing the two. On the extreme right we see downflow¬
ing rain and on the extreme left evaporation scrolls,
indicating that the narrative of the scene moves in
a clockwise direction. At the base of the tree, at
ground level, seven figures are involved in various
activities. I will number these figures 1 through 7
from right to left. Figure 1 on the far right is holding
an umbrella, and appears to be assisting Figure 2.
Figure 2, probably Hunahpu, holds a writing utensil Diagram 156. Izapa stela 5. The
Mesoamerican Creation myth
and is teaching Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 is probably
a small child. On the left side of the tree, Figure 5
appears to be taking instruction from the imposing Figure 6. Norman and Lowe
believe that Figures 6 and 7 are Xpiyacoc and Xmucane, one of the Creator couples
from the Popol Vuh.
In the background of the entire scene, visible on the extreme left and right of
the stela, a U symbol with a gaping tooth-filled jaw can be identified. This U sym¬
bol is a common component of many Izapan stelae, and is thought to represent the
moon or an Earth deity. In general, however, this symbol of the tooth-filled jaw
represents the mouth of the Underworld. As such, Stela 5 is intended to portray
mytho-astronomical events rather than mundane, historical ones. The narrative in
complex scenes like this is read by following the symbolic connections between
the figures. For example, it is probably no accident that the feet of the small figure
directly above Figure 2 touch the "Ahau" cap of that figure. On the left and right of
the tree, there are two main human figures suspended in midair. They are wearing
bird deity masks, and the beak of one of them seems to be inserted into the tree.
Stela 5 probably depicts events from different World Ages, and thus the narrative
sequence can be temporal as well as spacial. Norman goes a long way toward clari¬
fying what is going on in this incredible monument, and concludes that it is some
form of a prototypal Mesoamerican Creation drama, clearly related to the Popol
Vuh.5
The so-called 'Toots" of the tree in Stela 5 are strange, and look like beard
scrolls or a deluge of water. In fact, they look a lot like the flood scene from the



276 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
Diagram 157. Flood-glyphs designating
Hurakan and Ahau rulers
Dresden Codex, in which water spews down¬
ward from the mouth of a sky deity attached
to zodiac panels. The Dresden Codex scene
illustrates the end of a previous World Age,
and, significantly, the flood comes out of a
mouth (see diagram 91 in Part III). In the
Popol Vuh, the high god Hurakan destroys a previous World Age by flood, and we
should not rule out that this flood was sent out of Hurakan's mouth, as that is a
common flood motif. In addition, Hurakan was the Heart of Sky, a primary Creator
God of the Popol Vuh. If Hurakan or his earthly Ahau servants are portrayed any¬
where in the monumental art, they should be identifiable by some kind of glyphic
insignia, such as those shown above.
In these prototypal Ahau glyphs, notice the
beard-like extensions from the mouths. These are
not song-scrolls, as some scholars suggest. I pro¬
pose that these are glyphic designations for the
mighty flood-bringer Hurakan himself, signatures
for his earthly Ahau representatives. Other "flood
beards" are found on Stelae 11 and 67, and a "flood
from the mouth" image appears on Stela 12. When
these appear in a monument, a calendric period¬
ending event is probably being portrayed. Stela 5
may in part portray such an event—the end of one
age and the beginning of another. After all, Stela 5
is generally acknowledged as a complex depiction
of the Maya Creation myth.
Moving on to other Group A monuments,
Stela 2 is in the middle of the south platform. It is
flanked by Stelae 1 and 3. Instead of an upturned
serpent as on Stela 3, Stela 2 portrays a tree with
branches spread wide, above which is the Seven Macaw/Big Dipper deity.
The cleft tree here, because of the north-south orientation of Stela 2, is prob¬
ably a metaphor for Tacana and its cleft. (The cosmic axis concept was mytholo¬
gized variously as a mountain/volcano, a tree, or a caiman-frog deity.) As we have
seen, the Big Dipper emerges from this cleft in era 300 b.c. But, on Stela 2, the Big
Diagram 158. Stela 2. Cleft Creation
tree, Seven Macaw, and the Hero
Twins



THE MONUMENTAL MESSAGE / 277
Dipper appears to be falling, head down. How can the
Big Dipper rise and fall at the same time? Stela 2 con¬
tains a profound paradox. As shown earlier, the Big
Dipper's precessional journey away from Tacana accel¬
erated and moved southeastward along the Tacana
Tajumulco horizon beginning around 1000 b.c. Accord¬
ing to my reconstruction, the entire "fall of Seven Ma¬
caw" myth actually refers to a larger World Age context
involving precession. Stela 2 depicts the Hero Twins do¬
ing something, most likely facilitating the demise of
Seven Macaw. As such, Stela 2, along with other monu¬
ments in Group A, participates in the message that Seven
Macaw, the Polar God, is no longer valid. However, the
Izapan initiate could still make the nightly observation
that Seven Macaw continued to rise through the cleft.
The paradoxical message of Stela 2 is that Seven Macaw
rises nightly but, in the long run, he falls.
Across the plaza, opposite Stela 2, Stela 4 also de¬
picts the descent of Seven Macaw. The figure holds a
sacrifice club, reminding us that deity sacrifice must take
place before world renewal. Seven Macaw must be done away with before the new
World Age ruler can arrive. It should be emphasized that Stelae 2 and 4 are located
in the center position of their respective north and south platforms, along Group
A's main axis. Because of the Seven Macaw/Big Dipper themes on these monu¬
ments and their position on the north-south "polar" axis, I feel that Group A was
primarily intended to represent the polar center.
Just to the east of Stela 4, Stela
25 depicts a scene from the Popol Diagram 160. Stela 25.

is standing firm on his polar perch, striking
a victory over Hunahpu by snatching his
arm. The Big Dipper has not quite reached
its meridian transit to begin its fall in the
west. There are other times of the year when
this Big Dipper-Milky Way configuration is
equivalent, though it occurs at different
times of the night. In general, Stela 25 shows
the Big Dipper bird deity in a strong, as¬
cended place, while other Group A scenes
show him falling. Clearly, the rise and fall of Seven Macaw is a primary story that
Izapan cosmologists wanted to tell their initiates. They wanted to convey the cos¬
mological discovery that, despite his apparent glory, Seven Macaw was a false god
and the polar center was no longer a valid cosmic center.
Maya scholars Linda Scheie and David Kelley identified the caiman on Stela
25 as the Milky Way.6 Kelley's diagram (161) of the Milky Way serpent-caiman
reveals why the tail end is flowering. The "mouth" side of the Milky Way is near
the December solstice, the time of year when the
rains fail and things become dry and infertile,
when, in a sense, life is devoured by the mouth of
the death monster. The tail end is in the rainy,
fertile months of May and June, and thus is de¬
picted as flowering. We have a clear statement here
that caiman and snake-beings refer to the Milky
Way on Izapan stelae. However, as seen on Stelae
27 and 10, the caiman transforms into a tree (note
the caiman masks at the base of these trees). The
mouth, or dark-rift, is inactive in these depictions,
but on Stelae 6 and 11 the caiman-frog deity is
pointing upward with its mouth open. This up¬
turned mouth symbol means "to be born."
Stela 1, on the south platform, contains a
clockwise rain-cycle motion. It accurately reflects
the sky motion occurring behind someone who
faces the stela.

circle
Diagram 161. Milky Way as Cosmic Tree
compared with caiman-tree on Stela 25



THE MONUMENTAL MESSAGE / 279
The circular motion on Stela 1 may have been a teaching device, similar to the
reversible paradox of simultaneous "rising and falling" on Stela 2. The intitiate
stood in front of the Stela 1 rain invocation, facing south. Looking at the stela, the
rain cycle is clockwise. Turning around, the initiate observed the stars spinning
counterclockwise around the North Celestial Pole. But if the initiate faced the stela
and imagined the stars spinning behind his head, he might "get it" and realize that
the polar sky's rotation is directly imaged on Stela l.7
ANOTHER GROUP A MESSAGE: TOOLS OF VISION AND THE
GALAGTIGTOAD
During the first century b.c., Izapa was contemporary with Tres Zapotes, a
latter-day Olmec town near the Gulf Coast, and it is clear that Izapa retained con¬
nections with the Olmec heartland to the north. Some Izapan monuments are dis¬
tinctly Olmec, and we can expect that important shamanistic institutions were
shared. In Part III, I elaborated on the use of psychoactive substances (such as
psilocybe mushrooms and toad venom), and, at Izapa, there are many depictions of
frogs, toads, and alligators. For example, in front of Group A's south platform, both
Stela 3 and Stela 1 have toad altars in front of them. The other important toad
image in Group A is on Stela 6, located on the main north-south axis. In the same
way that the three pillar-and-ball monuments in Group
B triangulate, the three toad depictions in Group A also Diagram 263. stela 6. Tripta
form a triangle. mine vision scrolls
Izapan shamans perceived toads—especially their
mouths—as vehicles or doorways to the Otherworld,
capable of birthing and/or swallowing deities who are
often seated in little boats. Stela 6 shows this kind of
scene, as well as something else.
Notice the strange dotted shoulder area, right
where the Bufo toad's triptamine-containing parotid
glands are located. (Toad Altar 2, in front of Stela 3,
also has dotted parotid glands.) The curling vision
clouds emerge from this area, indicating that the toad's
gland secretions are a source of vision. The mythic
meaning seems to be that the Sacred Toad can carry



280/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
Diagram 164. The three-spot
toad-gland motif ©
one into the mouth of the Otherworld, into
the cosmic center! Though there are toad al¬
tars and many other carvings of toads and
crocodiles at Izapa, the Stela 6 depiction is unusual among Izapan sculpture. And it
says a great deal about one important facet of Izapan cosmology: It was informed by
the use not only of psychoactive mushrooms, but also of 5-MeODMT, a powerful
hallucinogen. As such, we can probably apply the same knowledge to other towns
within the Izapan sphere, such as Abaj Takalik and El Baul, places where very early
Long Count monuments were found. But precision in equating toad habitats with
early Long Count monuments is not even necessary. These substances were defi¬
nitely used, and were probably traded throughout large areas of Mesoamerica. The
insights and knowledge afforded by such progressive evolutionary tools were clearly
part of the shamanistic and cosmological mindset of the people who created the
Long Count. Using these tools wisely, in the development of an advanced cosmol¬
ogy we are just beginning to understand, implies a type of sophistication on the
part of Izapans not to be equated with their level of technological achievement.
The advanced paradigm forged by the ancient skywatchers, orienting themselves to
the greater Galaxy, was achieved by recognizing and us¬
ing the powerful tools of consciousness, offered by na¬
ture herself, lurking within deer dung and warty toads.
Evidence of this kind also is found elsewhere. For
example, there is a toad glyph on the Tablet of the Pal¬
ace at Palenque, dated to a.d. 645.8 The mundane refer¬
ence of this glyph is to the haab month "Uo" (frog), but
the primary attribute of this toad glyph are the three spots
on the back of its head—the parotid glands of Bufo ma
Diagram 165. Crocodile de¬
ity from the murals of Bo
nampak
nnes.
This three-spot toad motif is found elsewhere in
Maya art, for example, on a "crocodile" being from the
murals of Bonampak. The deteriorated Bonampak mu¬
rals were recently reconstructed with high-tech computer
equipment.9 In Room One, there are human beings (deity impersonators engaged in
a Mystery Play) wearing deity masks. The one of interest is the caiman or crocodile
mask, which includes a three-spot motif on its shoulder, out of which sprouts a
waterlily vision plant.10



THE MONUMENTAL MESSAGE / 281
Of course, this is a crocodile rather than a frog, illustrating the crossover in the
representation of different animal species that scholars recognize as common in
Maya art. In other words, snakes, frogs, and caimans are in the same mythic cat¬
egory as all water deities—beings of the watery Underworld beneath the cosmic
ocean.
These depictions suggest that the toad was a shamanic spirit guide and also
served as the "vehicle" of vision. Stela 6, like the similar jaguar-toad deity on Stela
11, is the Milky Way, and the upturned mouth is thus the dark-rift. In this alternate
reading, the boat floating above the toad's mouth may depict the solar hero sailing
over the Milky Way or into the Otherworld. Or, the boat may simply indicate that
a journey is being made, a vision journey into the mouth of the Milky Way. In any
case, Stela 6 is very important, for it suggests that the Izapan shamans knew how to
use the Bufo marines toad to facilitate vision journeys into outer space.
THE LESSON OF THE POLAR GOD
The primary concern of Group A's message is with the north-south polar axis,
and the movement of the Big Dipper around Tacana to the north. This seasonally
changing movement was keyed to the rain cycle, and thus involved the birth of
corn and the Maize Deity. Group A's reminders that the northern polar events were
opposed to the southern December solstice events are provided by Stela 27, Stela
25, as well as Stelae 6 and 3.
The symbolism on each Izapan monument, regardless of which group it is in,
refers to its respective cosmic center in consistent ways. The stelae associated with
the December solstice horizon (27, 11, 50, and 10) involve impregnation, umbilical
connection, and birth or rebirth. Scenes oriented north-south (Altars 20 and 3, Ste¬
lae 4, 25, and 2) consistently portray the cyclical rise and fall of the Seven Macaw/
Big Dipper deity around the pole. Apparently, the Izapan astronomer-priests con¬
sidered the cyclical ascent-descent motion (of the north) to be equivalent to the
cyclical death-rebirth process (of the south), a notion supported by the Popol Vuh
metaphor that equates dawning with birthing. In Maya thought, the rising or "dawn¬
ing" of celestial bodies is likened to birth and growth, whereas stellar descent is
equivalent to dying and death. This concept is found throughout Mesoamerica and
is certainly true for the modern Quiche Maya.11 The descent of the stars of the Big
Dipper symbolizes the death of the old Polar God, Seven Macaw. He was a vain and



282 / MAYA COSMOG E N E S I S 2012
false ruler, follower of lies. His lesson to humanity is that deception is fueled by
self-interest and ultimately results in exposure and self-destruction.
Izapan thinkers mythologized the December solstice astronomy primarily with
birth and resurrection metaphors. However, it also involves death motifs. The dark
rift Otherworld doorway that rose heliacally on the December solstice as the Big
Dipper set is a birthplace and a deathplace. Why? It is a birthplace because it is the
birth canal of the cosmic Milky Way Creatrix, where the solstice sun gets reborn in
a.d. 2012. It is a deathplace because it is the portal to the land of the dead and
unborn. The cosmic birthplace also is the sacrificial altar, the chilate hole of offer¬
ing. World renewal does not just happen, the day does not automatically dawn, the
rains do not always fall on time—these things require ongoing sacrifices to facili¬
tate and ensure their recurrence. As we saw earlier, ritual sacrifice played a promi¬
nent role in the Mesoamerican ballgame. It was ritual sacrifice performed as a form
of sympathetic magic to ensure that the cosmic gameball went into the cosmic
goalring. The cosmic meaning of the ritual ballgame—that the game is over in a.d.
2012—is clearly present in Izapa's ballcourt.
IZAPA'S COSMIC MESSAGE: GALACTIC CENTER CONVERGENCE
Each of the three main Izapan monument groups each point to one of the
three cosmic centers recognized in Mesoamerican cosmology. Group A refers to
the polar center, and portrays the mythic rise and demise of the ancient Polar God.
Only Stela 27 in Group A clearly refers to another cosmic center, almost as if to
answer the question: If Seven Macaw is a false god, defeated by the Hero Twins,
where then is the true cosmic center? Stela 27 provides a clue, leading us over to
the Group B monuments. As we saw, Group B refers to the zenith center, and
Throne 1 in particular encodes a large amount of relevant astronomical informa¬
tion. Several stelae in Group B clearly portray the astronomy in the December
solstice direction, as if the esoteric message was slowly being revealed to the Izapan
initiate. Yes, there is more than one cosmic center. The Group B monuments tell
us that the cosmic center is the zenith, and one may ascend into it, but only on
certain days of the year. Knowing that the latitude of observation is critical for
measuring solar zenith-passage dates, Izapan astronomers must have realized that
the zenith center could be accessed, but the timing of its manifestation varied. So,
our attention is drawn to the three stelae on the west platform of Group B, which



THE MONUMENTAL MESSAGE / 283
includes Stela 11, where a solution to the zenith dilemma is offered. It was prob¬
ably here that the Izapan cosmonauts-in-training first learned of the vast cycle of
precession, and it was here, in front of Stela 11, that they were initiated into the
mysteries that would lead them to Group F and its ballcourt. The ultimate revela¬
tion of the Izapan Mysteries is the Galactic Convergence on 13.0.0.0.0, but they
first glimpsed this incredible knowledge when they saw Stela 11 in Group B. Group
F, as we will see, encodes the Galactic Center synchronization of 13.0.0.0.0 via its
ballcourt monuments. Before we move to explore Group F, we must pause at cer¬
tain exceptional monuments from areas outside Group F that face the December
solstice and make important statements about the future Galactic Alignment that
occurs there.
Stela 11 is one of the most symbolically striking monuments in Group B. In
my book The Center of Mayan Time, I emphasized this
stela as the best Izapan monument representative of the
World Age astronomy of the 13-baktun cycle end-date.
It faces the December solstice sunrise, where the dark
rift rose shortly before the solstice sun during Izapa's
heyday. I still feel that Stela 11 tells a simple and
straightforward story about the sky toward which it
faces—its message concerns the rebirth of the world.
Is Stela 11 only telling us about the sun's rebirth at
dawn? Is it only portraying the sun's annual rebirth on
the December solstice? No, for it is shortsighted to limit
the metaphor to the daily and annual levels. It does not
take a great leap of insight to understand Stela 11 for all
it is worth. If we accept that the toad-jaguar's mouth
symbolizes the dark-rift, Stela 11 says "the sun is re¬
born when it is in the dark-rift—the place of transfor¬
mation, the portal to the Otherworld, the birth canal of
the Milky Way Great Mother."
In Stela 11 we can clearly see the true meaning of
the dark-rift "mouth" of the Milky Way as a birthplace.
Gareth Lowe, one of the archaeologists who excavated Izapa in the 1960s, associ¬
ates Stela 11 with the day-sign lx (Jaguar).12 The toad-jaguar's mouth has symbol¬
ized the portal to the Otherworld since Olmec times, and the modern Quiche Maya
Diagram 166. Stela 11. The De¬
cember solstice sun in the

the astronomical alignment of

284/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
call the dark-rift the xibalba be, the Road to the Otherworld. Commonly, Under¬
world portals were visualized as caves. In the Tzotzil Maya language of highland
Chiapas, the word for "cave" is ch’en, which also means "vagina."13 Lowe also
associates Stela 11 with the Yucatec Maya haab month Chen ("cave ).14 Here we
have meaningful connections implicit in the work of Maya scholars that associate
Stela 11 with jaguar mouths, caves, portals to the Otherworld, and birthplaces.
And what of the solar deity emerging from the toad-jaguar's mouth? The out¬
stretched hands on Stela 11 represent completion or measurement—a typical period¬
ending concept. In the Popol Vuh, First Father measured the cosmos at the begin¬
ning of time by stretching a measuring cord to the four cosmic corners. On Stela 11
we see a frog or toad (the Milky Way) birthing the solar First Father deity. In the
calendar glyphs, the frog or toad glyph stands for the 20-day uinal period of the Long
Count. As such, again we encounter the concept of time-period completion (and
commencement).
In Maya hieroglyphs, when the frog's mouth is upright and open, the meaning
is "to be born" and "date initiation."15 This identification is basic and very impor¬
tant, and confirms that Stela 11 represents the alignment of the December solstice
sun with the dark-rift in the Milky Way that occurs on the 13-baktun cycle end
date in a.d. 2012. Furthermore, given the "to be born" meaning of the upturned
frog's mouth, the way the future alignment was thought of in Izapan/Maya Cre¬
ation myth involved the solar First Father hero being reborn, or emerging, from the
dark-rift portal to the Otherworld, which was symbolized by the mouth of a toad.
My emphasis on the fact that the upturned frog-glyph means both "date ini¬
tiation" (as in a new Creation) and "to be born" (as in the sun in the dark-rift)
challenges Maya scholars Nikolai Grube and Linda Scheie's identification of the
celestial Creation Place of the Maya. They focused exclusively on the "Ak" or
turtle glyph as a reference to the three hearthstones of Creation (three stars in the
Orion constellation). On certain Classic-period ceramics, the First Father/Maize
Deity is depicted being reborn from the back of a turtle. Thus, they argue that the
celestial location of his rebirth is in Orion. However, the Classic-period represen¬
tations of the cosmic turtle's back (Orion) as a birthplace probably do not reflect
the original Izapan Creation myth. Ultimately, the frog-mouth birthing glyph is
just as compelling as Scheie's interpretation of Maya Creation that was based on
the Ak turtle glyph and that focused only on the Milky Way/ecliptic Creation
crossroads near Gemini.16 In terms of astronomical exactness, the scenario near



THE MONUMENTAL MESSAGE / 285
Sagittarius is much more precise than the one proposed for Gemini-Orion. (The
three hearthstones in Orion are quite far from both the Milky Way and the eclip¬
tic.) Given my extensive work on the true meaning of the 13-baktun cycle end
date, an important and central aspect of Maya Creation astronomy definitely ap¬
pears to have gone unrecog¬
nized by scholars. If the turtle
or “Ak” glyph was hailed as
the key to Grube and Scheie’s
interpretation of Maya Cre¬
ation occurring near Gemini
Orion, then the “to be born”
frog glyph is the epigraphic
and iconographic key to my
reading of Creation at the
Milky Way dark-rift near Sag¬
ittarius.
Ultimately, as I argued in
Chapter 10, both Creation lo¬
cations are probably valid,
each being a dialectical inflection of the same underlying Creation complex. In
other words, the birth of the Maize Deity from the Ak turtle (in Orion) represents
the annual rebirth of the Solar/Maize God around the June solstice (when the sun
passes through Gemini). On the other side of the sky, the December solstice sun's
rebirth through the dark-rift in the Milky Way is the rebirth of the First Father
Solar/Maize Deity on the level of World Ages.
The sun-in-mouth image is found elsewhere at Izapa, and throughout
Mesoamerica. Stela 11 remains an outstanding example, complete unto itself, of
the future astronomical alignment toward which it faces. It portrays the future
conjunction as a joining of deities—the First Father/Solar Deity joins with the Jag¬
uar-Toad Deity, who is the cosmic birther and therefore an avatar of the Great
Mother (the Milky Way). In fact, the jaguar-toad on Stela 11 is equivalent to the
caiman-tree on Stela 25, which has already been identified with the Milky Way.
The real identity of the Milky Way as a Cosmic Birther lurks behind these multiple
metaphors. As such, the future alignment was mythologized as the union of First
Father and Cosmic Mother. Amazingly, stelae representing these mother-father
Diagram 167. a) Creation via the dark-rift near Sagittarius:

principles are found in Group E, where we will briefly pause on our journey to the
Group F ballcourt.
GROUP E: TH E MOTHER-FATHER UNION
Group E is the southernmost group of monuments along Izapa's main north
south axis. In Group E, Stelae 19 and 20 are oriented to the rising December solstice
sun, and presumably tell us something about what happens there. We can imagine
Izapan priests standing at the altars in
front of Stelae 19 and 20, making of¬
ferings as they watched the dark-rift
in the Milky Way rise in the predawn
December solstice sky. The dark-rift
was understood to be the birth canal
of the Milky Way Great Goddess. It
was the portal to other dimensions,
the cave in the sky into the Heart of
Creation, the mouth of the snake or
frog or jaguar, all of whom were ani¬
mal totems of the Milky Way Mother,
vehicles of travel into the Underworld
Womb of All. Frogs croak wildly be¬
fore the Mother Goddess's water blessing of rain. Snakes, tadpoles, and other am¬
phibians shed their skins and transform. Likewise, the Cosmic Mother principle is
the Great Transformer.
Stela 19 is an abstract representation of the female creation principle. The V
shaped cleft and the vertical slot within the circular diadem symbolize the female
birth cleft.
Stela 20, on the other hand, with its phallic "breechcloth" of Ahau rulership,
is an abstract representation of the male creation principle. Together, Stelae 19 and
20 symbolize the cosmic male and female principles.
The ancient astronomer-priest that we imagined performing offerings in front
of Group E's mother-father stelae would have been observing a profound event with
a knowing eye. As dawn drew near, the December solstice Ahau or solar deity, who
only appears once a year, began to show his face. The sky brightened and the pen

etrating, fertilizing power of the solar rays announced the rebirth of the year. The
magic of watching the December solstice sunrise at Izapa 2,300 years ago lay in the
knowledge that the cosmic male and female principles were slowly approaching
each other, revealing an exquisitely extended foreplay that will culminate in the
engendering of a new World Age when they join—an event projected by Izapan
calendar-priests, quite accurately, to occur on 13.0.0.0.0:
December 21, 2012 a.d.
Stelae 19 and 20 emphasize the ritual importance of
the December solstice, cosmic creation via a union of
opposites, and world renewal. They are the only abstrac¬
tions of their type at Izapa, and share Group E with just
one other poorly carved boulder. They embody the dia¬
logical ideal of mutual complementarity, or oppositional
union, and that union is achieved only after an excruciatingly long period of time.
My reading of the Group E monuments is quite simple: They state that 2012 is an
era of cosmic insemination, the union of the highest male and female principles of
Creation manifest in the solstice sun and the Galactic Center. It is an event that
impregnates the next World Age with new growth.
Stela 88 is a fragmented sky panel found near Group B a few years after the

£
Diagram 170. Cleft-like “jaguar snout” sky panels
archaeological project at
Izapa was completed (dia¬
gram 169). This sky panel
symbolizes the fertilization
of the female cleft. The round element is the solar male seed and the V-shaped cleft
with spiral scrolls on either side is the female birth cleft. As such, this stelae speaks
the same message as Stelae 19 and 20 in Group E. In fact, many sky panels at Izapa
are cleftlike.
On one level of interpretation, these sky-panel motifs represent the stylized
snout of a jaguar. Thus, the mythic scenes that unfold on each stela occur in the
mouth of the jaguar, that is, in the Otherworld. For my reading of Stela 88, this
makes perfect sense, as the female birth canal is also the portal to (and from) the
Otherworld.17 In general, Izapan stelae depict principles of mythic astronomy or
abstract concepts rather than local historical events. Together, Stelae 19, 20, and 88
clue us in to how the Izapan skywatchers thought about the astronomy along the



288 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
December solstice horizon, and mother-father union appears to have been a central
metaphor. If they were unaware of precession and the future alignment of 13.0.0.0.0,
how do we adequately account for the mytho-astronomical symbolism so clearly
portrayed on these monuments? And beyond this evidence, the Group F ballcourt
provides a profound and clear confirmation of my reconstruction of the esoteric
mysteries of Izapan cosmology.
Importantly, the cleft sky-panel symbol is structurally similar to the glyph for
a ballcourt, reinforcing the well-known association between ballcourts and the
Underworld. Ballcourts were theaters of Mystery Play, and the dramatic Creation
events enacted on their fields symbolically occurred in the Otherworld—the di¬
mension that underlies material manifestation—where humans and deities dance
together and cocreate the cosmos.
GALACTIC COSMOLOGY IN THE IZAPAN BALLCOURT
As we have seen, Group B is primarily concerned with the zenith axis, whereas
Group A depicts events around Tacana on the north-south "polar" axis. It is not
surprising then that the Group F ballcourt is oriented toward the southward De¬
cember solstice axis and the Galactic Center, and tells us with its symbolic monu¬
ments about the astronomical events viewed in that direction.18 The Group F mes¬
sage is read in the following monuments:
• Throne 2 and associated monuments on the west end of the ballcourt
• Stela 60 and associated monuments on the east end of the ballcourt
• Stela 67 along the north edge of the ballcourt, comparable to Stela 22, found
a short distance south of Group F
• Monument 25, a Sky Mover Deity on the south edge of the ballcourt, across
from Stela 67
• Feature 12 (recovered from a burial cache in nearby mound 125a)
The astronomical message of Group F and its ballcourt is strong and clear. While
Group A is thought by archaeologists to have been in use early in the Guillen Phase
(300 b.c.-50 b.c.) and Group B was used simultaneously and a short time later, Group
F was used up through the Classic period, and even into the Post-Classic. This sug¬
gests that the Izapan Mysteries, with Galactic synchronization as the most coveted



THE MONUMENTAL MESSAGE / 289
and highest degree of initia¬
tion, were taught for a thou¬
sand years. All of the Izapan
monument groups were ritual
in nature, and Izapa as a whole
was a sacred ground where
warfare did not take place and
where few, if any, people lived.
It was a place where the Ga¬
lactic Cosmology was revealed
as the most profound spiritual
mystery human beings could
embrace.
Roughly 2,100 years ago,
certain monuments from
other parts of Izapa were
brought to Group F and reset
according to a specific mes¬
sage. The main platform is oriented north-south but only a few scattered and bro¬
ken monuments were found there. However, many offerings were excavated inside
Temple 125a, including a throne-sitting king
shaman, which tells us something important
about the throne in the ballcourt. Two frog al¬
tars and a T-shaped stone were found south of
the main platform. The primary monumental
message of Group F, however, revolves around
the ballcourt (see diagram 171).
Note Miscellaneous Monument 4 to the
northwest of the ballcourt. This is a zenith gno¬
mon, apparently the only nod to the zenith cen¬
ter in Group F. Stone balls and rings were found
in specific placements at both ends of the
ballcourt, and they clearly represent the
gameball and the goalring. Throne 2 is at the
west end of the ballcourt, and the visual field

offered to one who sat on this throne sights down the lengthwise axis of the ballcourt
to the December solstice horizon, where the solar "gameball" and the dark-rift
''goalring" rose on the morning of the December solstice. During Izapa's heyday,
they were separated by roughly 30°, and were not set to join for another 2,100 years.
Throne 2 and Stela 60 oppose each other on the southeast-northwest axis of
the ballcourt. Stela 60, though fragmented, shows one of the Hero Twins as a victo¬
rious ballplayer standing over a completely defeated Seven Macaw (see diagram
172).
This stela portrays the final victory over the Lord of the Polar Region. As we
have already explored, in the Quiche Popol Vuh, the Hero Twins defeat Seven Ma¬
caw by shooting him out of his tree before they begin their attempts to resurrect
their father, One Hunahpu. The final defeat of all the Xibalban Lords prior to One
Hunahpu's resurrection occurs in the
Underworld Ballcourt, place of mythic
battle and victory over the powers of
darkness. In front of Stela 60 we find
Monuments 33 and 35, a stone ball in¬
side a doughnut-shaped "goalring." To¬
gether, all of these monuments say, "The
gameball is in the goal, the game is over,
Seven Macaw is dead, the solstice sun
can be reborn." Clearly, Stela 60 and its
ball-and-ring stones express part of this
statement, while the dawn astronomy on
the December solstice, viewed directly
over this group of monuments, supplies
the rest. Those who viewed the skies over
Stela 60 were the ballplayers themselves
and the king-shaman who sat on Throne
2 on the other side of the ballcourt. This
is what they saw (diagram 173).
We already explored the cosmic symbolism of the Mesoamerican ball-game in
Chapter 11. However, to briefly review, the gameball symbolizes the sun. Its move¬
ment into the dark-rift "goalring" represents solar rebirth on the highest of three
temporal levels: daily at dawn, yearly (at dawn on the December solstice), and in

Diagram 174. Stela 67. First Father in the

terms of World Ages (at dawn on the Decem¬
ber solstice of 13.0.0.0.0). At Chichen Itza,
the ballcourt was oriented to the Milky Way
at midnight on the June solstice in era a.d.
865.19 Thus, the ballcourt itself was under¬
stood to be the Milky Way. But it had other
mythological identities too. For example,
Stela 67, in the center of the ballcourt's north
wall, shows a victorious solar hero inside a
long canoe.
His arms are outstretched, like the First
Father figure on Stela 11. This arm-span mea¬
suring gesture symbolizes a period-ending event, and brings to mind the great pe¬
riod-ending of 13.0.0.0.0. But why is this Solar Ahau sitting in the middle of a ca¬
noe? Could it be that the world ends when the Solar Lord (First Father) comes to sit
in the middle of the Milky Way "canoe"? Mayanist Linda Scheie identified the sky
canoe on incised bones from Burial 116 at Tikal as the Milky Way.20 The Paddler
Gods, including the First Father Solar/Maize Deity, are among the occupants of
this Milky Way sky canoe. Izapa Stela 67 seems to portray the same meaning, and
indicates that the Milky Way could be a ballcourt or a canoe.21 Given that Stela 67
is along the lengthwise edge of the ballcourt, halfway between the east and west
ends, the placement of the canoe portrayed on it parallels the ballcourt itself. The
Group F ballcourt, then, represents the Milky Way, and its orientation physically
points to the Milky Way's rising central
bulge on the December solstice. But the
Milky Way was also seen to be a canoe,
because it sails through the oceanic night
sky, rising and setting. The dark-rift, in
this canoe metaphor, is likened to the de¬
pression in which the First Father/Paddler
God sits. Because the Milky Way canoe's
movement involves precession, the Pad¬
dler God is the Mover of the Sky, the
architecton who controls the shifting of
the celestial vault. In short, the Paddler
Diagram 175. Stelae 6 and 3. Vision boats and

292 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
God is another manifestation of the First Fa¬
ther/One Hunahpu deity.
Solar Lords inside canoes are found on
other Izapan monuments. Stela 6 and its op¬
posed partner Stela 3 both show serpent-toad
deities with upturned gaping mouths (see dia¬
gram 175). Both have manned "U-boats" bal¬
ancing just outside their mouths. Since ser¬
pent-toad mouths were thought of as Under¬
world portals, this image may symbolize the
shaman-astronomer's vision journey through
the Underworld (the night sky). It appears that
the First Father Solar/Maize Deity sits in the
the cleft, and journeys through the night sky (into the xibalba be, Underworld
portal). The serpent-toad mouths upon which the canoe floats reinforce the Under¬
world context, as well as the meaning of "to be born." When the astronomer-priest
returns from his otherworldly journey, he experiences a reentry or rebirth. In addi¬
tion, the psychoactive substance extracted from the Bufo marines toad portrayed
on these monuments was, literally, the vehicle of travel into the Otherworld.
In general, then, Stela 67, placed in the "middle" of the northern wall of the
Group F ballcourt, shows the First Father deity in
the middle of the Milky Way. In other words, it shows
One Flunahpu in the Galactic Center. Remembering
that One Hunahpu represents the December solstice
sun, the mythic astronomy encoded on Stela 67
points right at the end-date in 2012.
The monumeht on the wall opposite Stela 67
adds to this interpretation. Monument 25 was found
along the south wall of the Group F ballcourt, but it
was in very poor condition. However, archaeologist
V. Garth Norman compares it to a well-preserved
"Danzante" figure found in the Izapa-Tuxtla Chico
area (see diagram 176).22The Danzante figure repre¬
sents what Monument 25 probably originally looked
like. It broadly resembles the Olmec figure found in
Diagram 177. Olmec Sky Mover
deity from San Martin volcano
Diagram 176. a) Danzante from Izapa
Tuxtla Chico; b) Monument 25 from Izapa
Group F

THE MONUMENTAL MESSAGE / 293
Diagram 178. Dresden
Codex Paddler God
the cleft crater atop San Martin Pajapan, the sacred volcano
of the Olmec (see diagram 177).
Linda Scheie interpreted the San Martin God as the an¬
cient Creation God who "raised the sky", the Milky Way.23
The Izapa-Tuxtla Chico Danzante is a form of the Sky Mover
deity. Could the deity on the eroded Monument 25 also be a
Sky Mover? Having been placed along the southern edge of
the Milky Way ballcourt, he could have been the Creation
Being intended to push the Milky Way through the sky. As
such, his function was similar to the Stela 67 Solar Lord on
the opposite wall, who rides in the Milky Way canoe. Imag¬
ine the original Monument 25: The Sky Mover kneels, pre¬
paring to lift the Cosmic Axis, the Milky Way. It is as if he
pushes the celestial frame along—he shifts the Milky Way's
position, eventually bringing it to a place where First Father can sit in its center.
This scenario suggests the precessional "movement" of the Milky Way into
conjunction with the dawning December solstice sun at the horizon (to occur on
13.0.0.0.0). Stela 67, opposite Monument 25, reflects this sky-moving activity by
depicting a solar hero in the "center" of the Milky Way ballcourt/canoe. Further¬
more, the "Chac paddling a boat" illustration from the Dresden Codex resembles
the San Martin Sky Mover via its squatting posi¬
tion and handling of the paddle (the paddle
"moves" the Milky Way canoe). This later Maya
God probably combines attributes from Stela 67
with the interpretation of Monument 25 as a Sky
Mover.
In general, Stela 67 and Monument 25 both
state that the Milky Way ballcourt moves through
the sky, that a period-ending occurs when the Solar
Lord/Paddler God arrives in the center of the
Milky Way, and that the Sky Mover atop the sa¬
cred volcano resides in a cosmic center and is re¬
sponsible for the sky's slow shifting. What we have
so far is astounding confirmation of the end-date
cosmology at Izapa. But there is more.

294 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
The most incredible and amazing mythic message of Group F, consistent with
ballgame astronomy and the end-date cosmology, revolves around Throne 2 and its
associated monuments on the west end of the ballcourt.
Take a careful look at this convocation of symbols, for they encode a profound
message. The drawing above shows how these monuments were originally found.
Because of the throne, we can guess that this place and this arrangement were of
primary significance in the cosmic meaning of the Izapan ballgame. An astrono¬
mer-priest or perhaps an initiate sat here and performed rituals and vision-journeys
while the ballgame Creation myth was being played out on the galactic ballcourt in
front of him or her. Before dawn on the December solstice, looking along the east¬
ward axis of the ballcourt (over Stela 60), the shaman-skywatcher sees the dark-rift
in the Milky Way—the goalring of the cosmic ballcourt—rising ahead of the sol¬
stice sun (the cosmic gameball).
Unlike Throne 1 in Group B, Throne 2 does not have a crossbands carved on it.
However, thrones were always thought of as four-cornered seats in the cosmic cen¬
ter. While Throne 1 represents the zenith center implicit in Group B, Throne 2
represents the cosmic center within the cross formed by the Milky Way and eclip¬
tic. This cosmic center is none other than the Galactic Center, identified by the
observable "nuclear bulge." That the Galactic Center was the supreme orienta¬
tional principle for Izapan cosmonauts is reinforced by the
ballcourt's orientation to the Milky Way/ecliptic crossroad and
the Milky Way's "nuclear bulge" as it rose heliacally on the De¬
cember solstice.
The only carved feature on Throne 2 is in the middle of its
eastward edge, facing the December solstice horizon.24 It depicts
a squatting frog or toad, feet broken off, with a large eroded hu¬
man head emerging from between its open legs. This is a birth
image, called the "hocker" position, and is widely represented in
Mesoamerican art.25 One may be tempted to see a diving god
here, after the style of Tulum in Quintana Roo, but the splayed
limbs are definitely legs, and, furthermore, their form resembles
the splayed jaguar-toad beast on Stela 11 and Stela 8. We also
have a clue from a ceramic figurine found in a burial offering
from the mound located just behind Throne 2.
Here we see a human figure sitting on a throne. It sports an
Diagram 180. Fea¬
ture 12. Birth or
“hocker” posture
on Izapan throne



THE MONUMENTAL MESSAGE / 295
"Ahau" cap of rulership, and sits in the birth posture, reminding us that Maya
king-shamans were conjurers, adepts who could travel into the Heart of Heaven
and channel or "birth" into local space-time the organizational patterns of the cos¬
mic center. The shaman on Feature 12 in diagram 180 above is squatting rather
than cross-legged, in a manner similar to the splayed legs on Throne 2. The role of
the person who sat on Throne 2 was to facilitate the birth of the Solar Godhead
through the birth canal between the legs, which is a metaphor for the future align¬
ment projected to occur along the December solstice horizon. The human head,
like emerging heads on sculpture elsewhere in Mesoamerica, represents a solar hero
or warrior, but, in general, the head symbolizes the sun. In Mesoamerican belief,
each kin (day or sun) has its own "face." In the Popol Vuh, One Hunahpu's severed
head was hung in the crook of the calabash tree (the dark-rift in the Milky Way).
The head of his son, Hunahpu, also was cut off, and at one point it was substituted
for the gameball. One Hunahpu's head, as explained earlier, represents both the
December solstice sun and the gameball. When he goes into the goalring, he is
reborn from the cosmic birth canal. In fact, the heads of the father and son together
may represent the same symbolic function via lineage continuity, a kind of reincar¬
nation of spiritual essense through procreation.26
Because the birth canal of the splay-legged being on Throne 2 symbolizes the
dark-rift in the Milky Way, observed rising to the southeast on the December sol¬
stice down the lengthwise axis of the ballcourt, the priest-king, or whoever sat on
Throne 2, engaged in a kind of visionary ritual magic to facilitate the future rebirth
of the world—the movement of the December solstice sun into birth-union with
the cosmic vagina (the dark-rift). In addition to this ceremonial magic, kicking the
game-ball into the goalring through athletic prowess provided a parallel set of sym¬
bols and another form of sympathetic magic. The ball-and-ring symbol of the un¬
derlying astronomical meaning of the 13-baktun cycle end-date occurs in front of
Stela 60 on the eastern end of the ballcourt, as well as in front of Throne 2 on the
western end. In front of Throne 2, we see the familiar ball and basin, directly under¬
neath the emerging solar head. This basin, ritual in function and symbolizing the
goalring, also may have served to collect the priest's blood during ceremonial blood¬
letting rites.
The third symbol associated with Throne 2 is an inverted serpent-head marker,
which probably was brought from somewhere else in the ballcourt. Labeled Miscel¬
laneous Monument 19, it had something in its mouth which is now broken off.



296/ MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
Similar serpent-headed wall adornments were found in other ballcourts in south¬
ern Mesoamerica (e.g., at Guaytan), many of which originally had little solar
heads placed in their mouths.27 Archaeologist V. Garth Norman suggests this monu¬
ment, too, originally held such a head—a little solar Ahau—in its mouth, depicting
the ubiquitous motif of a solar deity emerging from a serpent's mouth. I believe the
Izapan ceremonialists intentionally placed this serpent-head monument next to
Throne 2 as a reiteration of the two other symbolic messages: The serpent's mouth
is analogous to the goalring as well as to the deity-ruler's vagina or birthplace.28 The
shared astronomical reference is, of course, to the dark-rift in the Milky Way. So,
here we find three symbol complexes that actually refer to the same mythic as¬
tronomy—the celestial convergence viewed along the ballcourt s axis over the east¬
ern horizon:
• Miscellaneous Monument 19. Inverted serpent (Milky Way) with a head in
its mouth (sun in dark-rift).
• Throne 2. Solar head emerging from birth canal (sun in dark-rift). This throne¬
birthing was enacted by a shaman-priest or king-shaman impersonating the
Milky Way as a Great Creatrix deity. In this case, the throne symbolizes the
crossroads formed by the Milky Way and the ecliptic in Sagittarius rather
than the zenith as on Throne 1 in Group B.
• Miscellaneous Monuments 17 and 18. A stone ball and a stone ring. When
the gameball (the sun) enters the goalring (the dark-rift), a new World Age is
born and Seven Macaw (the old Polar God) is defeated; Stela 60 and its ball
and-basin on the other side of the ballcourt reinforce this reading.
Everything in the Group F ballcourt cries out that the December solstice hori¬
zon is where the sun converges with the cosmic birth canal. This cosmological
event, pinpointed via the 13-baktun cycle end-date of the Long Count calendar, and
encoded into the ancient Hero Twin story that later became the Quiche Popol Vuh,
is intimately tied into the socio-political meaning of Mesoamerican king-shamans
as throne-sitting conjurers and birthers, and was facilitated through the sympa¬
thetic magic of the ritual ballgame. It is quite astounding that these Group F monu¬
ments yield such a consistent, complex, and meaningful message. The key to un¬
locking these multilevel symbols is accepting that the ancient Izapan astronomers
were tracking the precessional movement of the astronomical features over the
solstice sunrise horizon.



THE MONUMENTAL MESSAGE / 191
Diagram 181. Izapa’s monumental message, sighting down the
Group F ballcourt toward the future Galactic Alignment of 2012
When I started this course of research many years ago, I saw Stela 11 as the
only likely candidate at Izapa to symbolize the World Age convergence over the
solstice horizon. Now, with these other revelations resulting from a close scrutiny
of Izapan iconography and astronomy, I am convinced that Izapan skywatchers were
tracking precession, played an important role in the formulation of the Long Count
calendar, created the Hero Twin story, and were informed by the use of psychoac¬
tive substances. There are multiple levels of meaning within Izapan cosmology,
but all levels are interwoven. The interpretive continuity I offer for a formerly in¬
scrutable iconographic code strongly suggests, in and of itself, that the underlying
cosmological meaning I propose is correct.
The profound cosmology hidden within Izapa's pictographic code represents a
great flowering of knowledge, an era of great visionary openness and achievement
that may have eroded into
bland secular dogmas by
the time the Classic Maya
appeared on the scene.
The Classic Maya did
adopt the Long Count cal¬
endar, already in use for
hundreds of years, and
should have retained the
profound Galactic Cos¬
mology of the Izapans
in some form. But how
much do we, denizens of
the most technologically
advanced civilization,
retain of the ancient
Greek art of sacred geom¬
etry? How much do Euro
Americans even care

tions of their own fore¬
bears—the lyrical bards,

dieval herbalists and alchemists? In looking closely at Izapan monuments, orienta¬
tions, topography, calendrics, and astronomy, we encounter a profound multidi¬
mensional cosmovision that may have been history to the Maya. However, when
we look deeper into Mesoamerican precessional mysteries, as we did in Part II, the
Galactic Cosmology does appear to have been present as late as ninth-century
Chichen Itza, where it was synthesized with the Zenith Cosmology.
The Galactic Cosmology that was formulated by the ancient Izapans is rel¬
evant today because the jewel in the crown of their cosmic science was the identi¬
fication of the era of World Age transformation to be experienced not just at Izapa,
but around the globe. We are living right now in this rare era of transformation.
And this is not just a vague, visionary prophecy—it is based on the empirical fact of
Galactic synchronization. I believe that one goal of the Izapan cosmonauts was to
spread their discoveries throughout the Mesoamerican world, and I believe they did
this by offering initiatory teachings at the site, using the monuments as visual aids.
For hundreds of years, Izapa was the home of esoteric Mystery Teachings and ini¬
tiation rites into Galactic Knowledge. Dare we imagine what these rites might have
been like? Our journey into the ancient Maya mysteries has taken us down long
overgrown pathways of the Mesoamerican psyche, and now we stand at the Izapan
gateway of Galactic Initiation. Shall we turn and flee at the profound majesty of it
all, and deny its promise of greater cosmological insight? Or shall we take a step
forward into the Galactic Mysteries that have been dormant for centuries and expe¬
rience for ourselves, in the final days of baktun 13, the deepest Maya mystery? Let
us take a walk around Izapa.

icture life in southern Mesoamerica, along the fertile slopes of the Pacific lit¬
toral. Volcan Tajumulco, the highest volcanic deity in a long chain of coastal
mountains, rises to the northeast. Volcan Tacana rises to the north, and from Izapa
the very heavens seem to revolve around this ancient sentinel's peak. Imagine groups
of dedicated Izapan stargazers in the little understood period between 700 b.c. and
300 b.c. embarked upon a journey of discovery, to fix the rate of the sky's slippage.
Data is gathered, is compared with that of other groups of skywatchers, and the
resulting knowledge is passed down through elite dynasties of specialized shaman
astronomers. For a hundred, two hundred years, the goal is constantly kept in mind.
Life is simple. Cacao is grown. Corn is grown. Temples are built. Trade improves,
rituals are performed. Shrines are swept, ancestors are called. And all along, the
sacred tools of vision are harvested and consumed, to commune with the inner
reflection of a place in the night sky, the deep cosmic center within—and without.
Knowledge and insights are gathered, calculations are fine-tuned. The Galactic
Calendar is formulated, tried and tested, and finally set in stone. It is now several
tuns before the arrival of the Savior in the Old World, and the countdown to the
Galactic dawn begins. The birth of the next World is over five baktuns into the
future, and it will occur only through the efforts of king-shamans, midwives, and
ballplayers. When Cosmic Mother and First Father join, then the doors will open
and human beings will truly be born.

Imagine you are an initiate, a truth seeker, come to Izapa to understand a new
knowledge. Your home is Tres Zapotes, and you are descended from the Olmec
people. You were taught that Seven Macaw is the highest god, that your people
have worshiped him as the ruler of the cosmic center for thousands of years, since
before the legendary migrations from the Far North took place.
But something is astir. Rumors abound that a new understanding of the cos¬
mos has surfaced, that skywatchers and calendar priests at a ceremonial site to the
south have decoded a profound insight into the cosmic order. They offer initiation
into their knowledge, the Izapan Mysteries, and you determine to find out what it
is all about. You have been told that you must wait until the time of the solstice,
when the Solar God is reborn. The time approaches. For twenty days you travel
along well-worn trade routes until you arrive at the controversial city.
At first, you are not im¬
pressed. There are no large pyra¬
mids like those found in your
homeland. But an energy stirs, a
bright, new, and mysterious en¬
ergy. Three days before the sol¬
stice, the Izapan astronomer
priests bring you, along with
twelve other initiates, to the first
group of monuments. You are
told that a story and a new un¬
derstanding of things will be re¬
vealed to you over the next three
days as you ceremonially journey
around the site. You will see
things you have never seen be¬
fore, and you are told you should
spread the word of what you
learn to all your people and all
your descendants. For what you
will see is the revelation of the
True God, the highest cosmic
center and source.

At sundown three days before the solstice, before the birth of the New Year,
you enter Seven Macaw's Group (Group A). First, you view Stela 5 and are told of
the ancient migrations to Izapa.

You then see Stela 25 and are shown how Seven Macaw rules from his throne
in the polar regions. The sun sets, and to the north you see Seven Macaw rising
through the Creation Cleft of the volcano they call Ta Can Na—the Place of the
Fourfold Mother-House.
STELA 25
At midnight Seven Macaw passes through his highest arc
scent. The priests now point out Stela 4, right next to Stela 25,
ancient god falling and being sacrificed. Looking at the pictures,
you see how Seven Macaw falls.
STELA 4
And you are told that he will fall away from the cosmic center of the north for
thousands of years to come. You do not understand, but are told that you soon will.
You will see how he falls from his perch, how he abandons his throne in the polar
center.
You resist being told that the Polar God is false. Still, you observe the descent
scene on Stela 4 and across the plaza on Stela 2. Walking across the plaza, you
notice that they both lie on the main axis of Seven Macaw's Group, an axis that
points to the polar throne above Ta Can Na.
STELA 2
Here you see the Hero Twins. They are Solar Gods, sons of the December Sol¬
stice Lord. They shot Seven Macaw out of his perch in the cosmic tree; they de¬
throned the false god to make way for the rebirth of their father, who will take over
as the new World Age ruler.
and begins his de

looking at the sky,



302 / MAYA COSMOGEN ESIS 2012
The priests compare the cleft tree on Stela 2 to the cleft volcano to the north.
Near Stela 2 you see Stela 3, and are told that there exists another Cleft of Creation,
and it is like a snake's mouth.
STELA 3
You are now facing south, away from the Creation Cleft of the Fourfold Mother
House volcano. At first you do not understand how there can be two Creation
Places. But, using the pictures on the monuments, the priests illustrate for you a
profound truth that disperses your confusion. They show you the rain cycle on
Stela 1. Wordlessly, with hand gestures only, they show you how the rain cycle
spins to the right.
STELA 1
They tell you to turn around and watch the sky. You look and see that the sky
spins around the Creation Cleft of the north, spinning to the left. You look again at
the rain cycle on Stela 1, and begin to understand. The direction of the cycle, when
facing the southern ocean, reflects the direction of the sky's movement going on
behind you. You understand a profound truth: North and south, backward and for¬
ward, up and down—these processes, though opposed, actually reflect each other,
like a pyrite mirror reflects the gaze, but in reverse.
Facing south, dawn approaches, and you see the Creation Cleft of the south
rising. It is the mouth of the great serpent, as shown on Stela 3. It is the Road to the
Underworld in the Milky Way stream of stars. It is the birth canal of the Cosmic
Mother. Yes, this is another Creation Place,- it is opposite Seven Macaw, and you
begin to wonder what this new knowledge means. They tell you straight out: There,
in the mother sky, is the true Fourfold Mother-House. Contemplating these new
thoughts, these introductory teachings, your mind opens slightly to the possibility
of truths higher than those you were taught back home. Day breaks, and the priests
usher you away to a thatched-roof hut where you are sequestered for meditation,
fasting, and sleep.
That evening you awaken, ready for more. It is now two days before the De¬
cember solstice. Once again, the initiation rites begin at dusk. You are shown Ste¬
lae 1 and 3 again, which introduced the snake's mouth as the other Creation Place.



INITIATION INTO THE IZAPAN MYSTERIES / 303
You understood why the snake's mouth is a birth canal, the Road to the Underworld
that devours and births. It is the cosmic Black Road leading into the depths of the
Fourfold Mother-House. Having reflected on what you were shown the previous
night, you see with your inner knowing that the cosmic Mother-House is fourfold
because of the four roads that emanate from her birth canal. You remember what
appeared to you yesterday, that what happens in the north is mirrored by what
happens in the south. Standing there, in comprehension of secret truths, the priests
step forward and whisper that, to fully understand the Izapan Mysteries, you must
journey into the mouth of the Cosmic Mother's nagual, or spirit companion. You
see that Stela 3 depicts the serpent form of the Great Mother's spirit companion. In
front of Stelae 1 and 3 are the toad altars upon which you must sacrifice your old
beliefs. They portray the vision toad, which you recognize as the same sacred toad
coveted by your own shamans back home. You grow fearful, unsure of what the
new knowledge might entail, but determine to continue with the initiatory revela¬
tion. The priests show you how the two toad altars make a triangle with Stela 6 on
the other side of the plaza. Walking across the plaza, you glance at the darkening
sky and see the gleaming stars, each like an eye, watching your movements. On
Stela 6, you see the Galactic Toad, spirit companion of the Milky Way Mother, and
you are told you must now journey to the Otherworld, into the dark-rift Creation
Place. Yes, your sacrifice involves being devoured by the Galactic Toad.
STELA 6
By now the sun has fully set. In the darkness, you see Seven Macaw waxing to
its height over Ta Can Na, as portrayed on Stela 25. For a long time you contemplate
what awaits you. As midnight approaches, you watch Seven Macaw going over the
top of his pole, and then he begins to fall, to die in the west. The priests explain you
will now see how Seven Macaw really falls, and they give you the smoke of the
Galactic Toad. Inhaling the smoke deeply three times, you fall back upon the grass,
gazing into the spinning stars of the polar zone. The sky strangely shifts, time opens
up, and the stars spin faster. The days and nights begin to speed by. Years fly by in a
whir; you watch Seven Macaw spinning and rising, rising and falling, rising and fall¬
ing. As the katuns fly by, he rises further and further away from the center of the
sky—he is falling away from his throne, his perch in the ancient polar center. See
how he moves! He rises further east along the slope of the volcano, no longer passing



304 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
through the Creation Cleft. After what seems an eternity, you stand abruptly to gaze
deeply into your own inner realization, and you now understand that the Polar God
is false. Immediately, you are whisked over to Stela 27, the only monument truly
facing the December solstice horizon—the rebirth place of the Hero Twins' father.
STELA 27
You see the dark-rift rising, along with the bright, sparkling stars of the widest
part of the Milky Way—the area the Izapans call the Womb of All, the womb of the
Milky Way Mother. The priests show you how to project yourself into the cosmic
mouth. They tell you to gaze at the carving, then at the sky, and to dive in. Your head
still swimming with the vision toad's smoke, you look at the cosmic caiman-tree in
the picture, and the cross in its center. Then, raising your gaze to the sky behind the
carving, you let go of yourself and fly upward through the interwoven celestial realms
of many dimensions, into the raging fury of the Creator-Destroyer. You see the Hero
Twins being conceived, and the Sacred Fount of Creation that is a tree, a volcano, a
river of stars, a churning hurricane of being. You journey into the heart and source of
all Creation, and understand the nature of human beings, time, and the role of Earth
in universal spiritual evolution. You forget about the old Polar God, recognize him as
the antiquated idea of a lesser understanding, and, in a flash, you see the True Deity
of All. She is the Cosmic Birther of all time and all space, of all beings and all worlds.
You descend back into your body, feeling disoriented. With the aid of your
Izapan guides, you stand. They lead you to the nearby river, where you are ceremo¬
nially immersed three times. They lead you to a fire, where you are warmed, fed,
and carefully observed. Daybreak soon comes, you stand up and stretch, and the
initiation process moves to the next level.
After sleeping for only a short while, during the next day you are told the
meaning of Seven Macaw's Group. The Polar God is no longer valid, for higher
truths have been discovered. You saw them the previous night with the aid of the
Great Mother and the Galactic Toad. You had a firsthand glimpse of the True Deity
and the true cosmic center and source. Hearing this, and knowing what you saw,
you feel you must let go of the old god, and embrace greater truth. Strolling around
the Polar God's group, you reflect upon what you have seen. You look, once again,
at Stela 27, and see how it portrays the events in the south, as a reflection of Seven
Macaw's movement in the north. Yes, you understand that there are two different



INITIATION INTO THE IZAPAN MYSTERIES / 305
cosmic centers, and you begin to wonder if there are even more. As if reading your
mind, the priests lead you to Group B, a short walk through a grove of trees. You are
told that this is the Group of Tzab-Kan-Kin, the Zenith God, otherwise known as
the feathered serpent.
In Group A you realized that the Polar God was false, and other centers of the
sky could be viewed. Stela 27, your yantric doorway into the Cosmic Mother, intro¬
duced a new place of Creation and the importance of the Sacred Tree Cross. Now,
Group B introduces the zenith center, another center of the north, for, as you know,
''up" and "north" lie in the same zone of the sky.
ALTAR 20
This altar faces north and lies along the main axis of Group B, reminding you
that Seven Macaw sits on his perch in the north, and you used to worship him. The
priests show you how the three pillars near the throne measure the passage of the
sun through the center of the sky, and they point out that the throne represents the
zenith center.
THRONE 1
Next to the throne is Stela 8. You see, in the lower section, a priest sitting on a
throne. In the upper portion the priest is traveling into the mouth of the zenith
center.
STELA 8
Your teachers explain the complicated astronomical symbolism encoded onto
Throne 1 and Stela 8, and then instruct you to sit on the throne and contemplate
Stela 9. You sit for hours, studying the image that stands before you. It is a very
simple picture, a human figure being carried into the zenith by a winged spirit
companion.
STELA 9
You remember the Seven Macaw altar facing the north, and how Seven Ma



306 / MAYA C0SM06ENESI5 2012
caw is false, and realize that the zenith center, since it also belongs to the north,
must also be a limited cosmic center. The deity ascending into the sky on Stela 9,
carrying an initiate such as you, has wings like Seven Macaw. The Zenith God is
in league with the false Polar God. Suddenly, you understand how to recognize
false truths and misleading doctrines. You understand the message of the Zenith
God's group: Some cosmic centers are illusions. Quickly now the priests turn
your attention to another part of the sky, as depicted on the monument to your
right.
STELA 10
Here you see the birth of the Hero Twins, with One Hunahpu—the First Fa¬
ther/December Solstice God—in the fat, billowing center of the Womb of All. The
priests told you of these new gods yesterday, and you see how they participate in
the new thought. In the image, First Father, the Solstice God, has ascended into the
many-layered realms of the sky, into the cosmic Mother-House of Creation, and
from there he impregnates the moon with Hunahpu and Xbalanque, so that they
may facilitate his future rebirth.
Again the priests direct your attention, this time to the three solstice-facing
monuments on the western platform. Most striking is Stela 11, and as dawn begins
to arrive, you look to the horizon it faces and see the Womb of All rising.
STELA 11
Soon, the Solstice Sun Deity makes his presence known, and you understand
the meaning of Stela 11. At some time in the remote future, the Solar Lord and the
Womb of All will join. In a reverse process to Seven Macaw's "fall" away from the
cosmic center in the north, which occurs over many baktuns, One Hunahpu as¬
cends toward the cosmic center of the south, the Womb of the Milky Way Great
Mother. You do not see it in a vision as you did with Seven Macaw's fall the other
day; nevertheless you sense that this is part of the new truth. But you wonder,
when will the resurrection of the Solar Lord occur?
The night is not yet fully over, and your teachers lead you to the group of
Cosmic Mother-Father Union (Group E). Here you observe priests making offerings
on the altars in front of two stelae. You look closely at the two stelae and intuit that



INITIATION INTO THE IZAPAN MYSTERIES / 307
they represent the cosmic mother and father principles, which are now beginning
to rise in the east.
STELAE 19 AND 20
The priests tell you more about the Hero Twins and their father, who is sym¬
bolized on Stela 20. He is the December Solstice Sun (First Father/One Hunahpu),
father of the Hero Twins. They also tell you about Cosmic Mother, who is symbol¬
ized by Stela 19. She is the Milky Way, the Womb and Birther of All—and her birth
canal lies in the center of the crossroads rising to the east. Observing the priests
making offerings and chanting ancient songs, you understand that their offerings
are intended to ensure the future union. Yes, we must make offerings to facilitate
the sky-Earth union, to bring renewed life and harmony to the world. Dwelling
upon the implications of all you are witnessing, you deduce that the world that will
experience the mother-father union exists in the remote future, and you cannot
imagine who will be around then. Will anyone still be worshiping at these altars?
Will seekers still be initiated into the Izapan Mysteries, the Galactic Cosmology?
Will anything even remain of Izapa itself? Or will the Galactic Knowledge be lost to
humans? The priests sense your confusion and questions, and explain that the day
will come when the knowledge of the True Deity will be lost to humans. But you
are also told that as the day of union approaches, the seeding of the Womb of All by
the penetrating rays of First Father will prepare the humans alive during the end
times to self-initiate and revive the lost knowledge. You are told that the message
of the Izapan Mysteries will survive intact under the jungle canopy, while a dark
chapter in human history unfolds. Forgotten and decaying for a thousand years, the
ceremonial carvings that preserve the Cosmic Wisdom will eventually be recov¬
ered, just in time for the New World to dawn. The shaman-priests have spoken,
opening their wisdom to you, and you respect their words, for they are not only
priests but visionary prophets. They are the nik wakinel, those who have gazed
into the center and have peered through the veils of time. And so another day of
initiation comes to a close as you watch the mother-father principles rise in the
east as the new day dawns.
Finally, the day before the solstice deity shows his face arrives. It is the final
day and night of your initiation into the new Galactic Cosmology. The priests con¬
tinue their lessons, and teach you the intricacies of the new calendar, designed to



308 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
calibrate the countdown to the future union of First Father and Cosmic Mother. It
has five number places, and works alongside the tzolkin calendar that your people
have followed for ages. You learn that a date of 7.18.0.0.0 is approaching, and are
told to take the new long-range calendar back with you to your homeland and to
teach it to others. They also tell you that the end-date, when the sky and Earth join,
is called 13.0.0.0.0. Working with the numbers on bark paper, you realize that the
resurrection of the True God will not occur until over 2,000 years have elapsed.
The teachings on this day have educated you in the tangible dynamics of the new
science, but your initiation is not over. You still must journey into the center of
time, into the Heart of Heaven and the end-beginning caldron of eternity. You have
yet to see the most profound message of the New Thought, and so you are brought
to an outlying group with a ballcourt—the group of the Sacred Ballgame.
The priests call this place Pom Kexel Horn, which means "Offerings and Res¬
urrection in the Ballcourt Graveyard." Offerings are made here, to ensure that time
will continue rolling forward and that the future union of First Father and Cosmic
Mother will occur. Resurrection, or rebirth, occurs when the shaman-initiate re¬
turns from an incredible journey into the Galactic Center, reborn after being bathed
in the Galactic Knowledge of the cosmic Mother Womb. Such a rebirth will also
occur for the entire world when it is renewed upon the future union of the Decem¬
ber solstice Solar Lord with the Great Mother's Galactic Heart. The word for ballcourt
is hom, which also means graveyard, and your teachers explain that new life comes
through death; sacrifice must be made in the ballcourt's "graveyard" to ensure fu¬
ture rebirth. At first you fear being put to death, but are told that the sacrifice is not
literal. For the initiate into the Izapan Mysteries, what must be sacrificed is the
ancient Polar Paradigm and all the vain illusions associated with it. Only then can
new life within a larger galactic consciousness be possible.
You, the initiate, are brought for rebirth into the ballcourt graveyard. It is after
midnight, the night before the December solstice deity arrives. After processing
with other initiates along the sacred path that links the main groups with the Ga¬
lactic ballcourt, you stand on the temple and view the entire area. The ballcourt
stretches below you, and you wonder what mysteries you will behold this night.
Solemnly, cacao and the sacred mushrooms are passed around. You drink, chew,
assimilate, and sit in meditation.
The stars turn ... As the veils of your vision begin to lift, a sense of the sacred
bestows you with courage. At that moment you are brought to the eastern entrance



INITIATION INTO THE IZAPAN MYSTERIES / 309
to the ballcourt. There you are shown the death of Seven Macaw, killed by the
victorious ballplayer. Yes, your old god is dead, exposed as false.
STELA 60
You, the initiate, are that ballplayer, and you must travel through the goalring.
Like One Hunahpu of the Creation myth, your head—your consciousness—will
separate from your body, and travel along the Milky Way ballcourt until you find
your way into the goalring, the dark-rift rising to the east. There, you will sit in the
middle of heaven, pass through the spacetime portal, and fly upward into the many¬
tiered cosmic layers, as depicted on Stela 67.
STELA 67
Slowly, the priests guide you in your increasing dreamlike trance to the west
end of the ballcourt, where they seat you on the Birth Throne. Straddling the God
Head on the front of the throne, you gaze into the eastern sky and see the Galaxy
the Great Mother—majestically rising.
THRONE 2, MONUMENTS 17, 18, AND 19
You look down and see the stone gameball at your feet, tottering on the abyss
of the goalring, and you envision it slowly, slowly, falling down into the hole. You
look up, head swimming with ecstasy, and fall forward. No, you are flying forward,
into the dark-rift hole in the sky rising over the distant horizon. Sailing upward and
outward, you are drawn magnetically into a spinning vortex of memory and feeling,
a hurricane of Creation forces pulling at every cell of your being. For what seems
like an eternity you sail through alien worlds and ancient vistas, dream clouds
sailing past you, and then you break through to a place of serenity filled with pres¬
ence—the presence of consciousness and life. It is a dark realm,- it is Xibalba. But,
strangely, although dark, it seems filled with a subtle light, the light of knowledge.
Emerging from between the shadows, the dim outline of a vast jeweled cavern be¬
gins to take shape. It seems like a huge, many-faceted eye, extending out to see all
times and places, and you are floating in its center. Bathed now in this numinous
nowhere, you feel the heartbeat of the Cosmic Mother surrounding you, welling up



310/ MAYA COSMOGEN ESIS 2012
inside you, enveloping you with love. Replenishing, rejoicing—a feeling of pure
consciousness cascades over you with a glowing urgency. Gratefully, in awe of the
gift, you wordlessly breathe in life and recognize that to live within this greater
domain is truly your Galactic birthright. All your illusions begin to melt, vanishing
in the sheer beauty of truth revealed. And then you begin to vanish, becoming so
subtle as to slip into the light, like a drop of water into the ocean. Everything stops,
and you cease to exist.
Diagram 183. The Maya jewel in the Galactic lotus
The next thing you know, you are suddenly startled with a shock of decelera¬
tion. Feeling your mind stretching across alien landscapes, searching for its home,
you experience waves of energy and sound that seem to realign your entire being,
imbuing it with new life. You feel yourself being constricted, pushed backward into
the warm, moist, steambath of your flesh. You slowly begin to remember who you
are, why you are here, and where you come from. A world of form begins to con¬
geal, as if materializing in front of you. The walls of the ballcourt appear to your left
and right, and the shadows begin to lighten. Your eyes refocus, Xibalba fades back
into the shadows, and the world takes form again. Gazing deep into the distant
horizon, in complete astonishment you see that the Great Mother has risen higher
in the east and realize that you were there, just now. A tear streams down your left



INITIATION INTO THE IZAPAN MYSTERIES / 311
cheek as it dawns upon you that, yes, you journeyed into the sky, into the Cosmic
Womb of Creation at the center of the cosmic crossroads. Along with the lighten¬
ing shadows that illuminate the ballcourt walls comes a dawning light of knowl¬
edge within yourself. And at the very moment in which your face brightens with
the new inner knowing, and your heart pounds, the dawning Solstice Sun Lord,
whom the priests call One Hunahpu, dramatically breaks free from the horizon, his
own face shining in the east.
The life-affirming light of truth has dawned, and you begin to sing a gentle
song of worship, one you just made up, a wordless vibration of thanks to the cos¬
mos and life. You know that your journey into the cosmic center fed a process of
cosmic union that will culminate in the distant future. Your consciousness, your
heart, ascended into the Womb of All, the throne of all space and time, and re¬
turned reborn. Now you understand that One Hunahpu makes this journey too,
but much more slowly. One Hunahpu travels in the royal procession of cosmic
time, each ascending step a katun, to his ultimate enthronement within his Cos¬
mic Mother's heart. He will arrive there intact only with the help of humans.
On your journey, you let go of disbelief and widened One Hunahpu's path,
bringing the cosmos one step closer to completion. You perceive that, like a magi¬
cal magnet, the Great Lake of Life draws all souls back into it, back to the center,
for rejuvenation and replenishment.
The more who make the journey, the bigger the spirit-magnet gets, until we
have all been drawn back into the cosmic heart. Returning to our daily lives re¬
newed and realigned with the Creation Place, we bring the Galactic wisdom and a
little bit of eternity down to Earth.

CHAPTER 24
THE FORGOTTEN GALACTIC PARADIGM
I
zapa was the center of initiation rites into Galactic Cosmology. It was an inno¬
vative ceremonial center where initiates were led around the monument groups,
slowly revealing that the ancient Polar God was false and that there were several
cosmic centers. In Group E, abstract cosmic principles were unveiled and their
future union was introduced. The ultimate revelation of the Izapan Mysteries came
in Group F, where pageantry and Mystery Play—a new Creation myth, a throne¬
sitting shaman-king, and a ritual ballgame—all came together to facilitate and cel¬
ebrate the future rebirth of the world. This would come through the center of the
Sacred Tree, through the Underworld Portal, by seeding the Cosmic Womb with
the fertilizing power of the highest day-sign and year-bearer, One Hunahpu, the
Galactic God of Precession. High initiates sat on the ballcourt throne, inhaled the
sacred smoke of the Galactic Toad, watched the ballgame Creation myth unfold in
front of them, and, finally, to their amazement, received the revelation of the mean¬
ing of the mysteries presented to them. They saw it and understood: The Cosmic
Womb began rising over the distant horizon, followed by the glorious appearance
of the solstice sun. That is when they got it. That is when they began to count the
days to the Zero Point of 13.0.0.0.0. That is when they saw First Father and Cosmic
Mother slowly embracing, and when they recognized the Galactic Center as the
true cosmic center and source. That is when Mesoamerica graduated from the limi
315



316/ MAYA COSMOG E N E S I S lOM
tations imposed by the ancient Polar God and reached the highest expression of
shamanistic cosmology.
After these December solstice initiations were over, the awestruck pilgrims
returned to their various corners of Mesoamerica and began to build a world that
would barely survive to see the cosmic dawning. The Izapans oriented Mesoamerican
civilization to the Galactic Center as a supreme organizing principle, and the rest is
history. The esoteric message of the Hero Twin story was eventually forgotten, the
Galactic Cosmology of the Long Count was lost. But the story was preserved on
Izapa's monuments. Now, in the final days of the Great Cycle of thirteen baktuns,
the fragments of this lost knowledge have been assembled and decoded. Izapa was a
unique astronomical center and innovative ceremonial origin-place of Mesoamerican
cosmic wisdom. With its monuments now dug up and reset in their upright posi¬
tions, the Galactic Ballcourt recobbled and swept clean of debris, it beckons us to
initiation into a forgotten Galactic Cosmology, the culmination of which happens
in less than a katun.
The implications of the lost Galactic paradigm formulated at Izapa are pro¬
found. It is a way of looking at the cosmos that seems strange to modern values and
assumptions, yet answers so many nagging and unresolved questions. Who are we?
What is our role in the greater scheme of things? An ancient style of relating to the
world is resurfacing, one that was followed by our Neolithic ancestors and that
survives in increasingly small populations of indigenous peoples. This new-old
paradigm values a way of being that is at odds with our own paradigm. For example,
the value of partnership as a basis for relating to others was one held in high regard
by the ancient cultures who worshiped the Mother Goddess, yet this position
counters the dominator mode of Western civilization that sets up hierarchies of
subordination.1 In the ancient paradigm, the value of direct connection between
oneself and deity is taken for granted, yet a fundamental concept in the Judeo
Christian tradition is the necessity of going through the Church and a secondary
deity to get to the primary one. Could it be that something is fundamentally wrong
with the basic tenets of our own paradigm, and that ancient Maya cosmology offers
an alternative, one that is more appropriate for surviving the impending transfor¬
mation?
The ancient skywatchers "engaged in the study of nature and its limits."2 Con¬
sidering that the Long Count cosmology is one that can, like other indigenous knowl¬
edge systems sketched in Part III, be termed "psychedelic" or "multidimensional,"



THE FORGOTTEN GALACTIC PARADIGM / 317
the limits of "nature" are the limits of the human mind. The knowledge-seeking
visionary journeys undertaken by New World shaman-astronomers provided the
data with which they crafted deeply profound cosmologies. In addition, as anthro¬
pologist Billie Jean Isbell wrote, "the native philosophers, who are usually astrono¬
mers or astronomer-priests, use methods and metaphorical language that are unfa¬
miliar to us."3 Some writers have even suggested that indigenous peoples are more
right-brained than their logical, left-brained cousins. In Maya thinking, as with
Amazonian tribes, "there exists a close relationship between astronomical obser¬
vations, cosmological speculations, and drug-induced trance states."4 The Indian
cosmologists engaged in questing inward for knowledge, into "the many layered
dimensions of the human mind."5 And in so doing, they encountered insights into
the fundamental principles of life, time, and spiritual evolution. By looking into
the human brain and mind, Maya cosmonauts discovered that the inner and outer
realities reflect each other, and that nature constantly engages in a dialogue be¬
tween apparently unrelated categories of experience. In other words, the evolution¬
ary heartbeat of humankind beats in rhythm with a higher, Galactic heartbeat, and
it is our inner dialogue with our cosmic source that weaves the future. As Gerardo
Reichel-Dolmatoff wrote, shamans understand that the human brain "is modeled
after the celestial vault and the human mind functions according to the stars, which
are the ventricles and sensoria of the cosmic brain."6
The cosmological understanding that emerges from shamanistic knowledge¬
gathering journeys into inner space results in a worldview that is deep, profound,
and right on target. These worldviews, though developed among materially impov¬
erished jungle tribes, embody the implicit order of the larger cosmos as reflected
and experienced within the human microcosm. This is a gnostic or experiential
knowledge quest, an approach to gaining an understanding of the cosmos that is
completely different from that of Western science. As a result of these consider¬
ations, to correctly interpret the data offered by an interdisciplinary study of
Mesoamerican cosmologies and cultures, we must at some point go beyond the
confines of Western science. We must put ourselves into the mind-set of the an¬
cient skywatchers to understand the deep insights they had found, and the inge¬
nious ways they worked those insights into their calendric cosmology and their
other shamanistic rituals. We might even adopt their exploratory methods and their
tools of vision. Such an endeavor is not outside the scope of what is available to the
average person: Modern ethnobotanists report that teonanacatl (psilocybin mush



318 / MAYA COSMOGEN ESIS 2012
rooms), San Pedro cactus, ayahuasca analogues, and other sacred plant medicines
are fairly easy to cultivate.7 However, many modern cosmonauts emphasize that
the way these sacred vision plants are used (preparation, motivation, setting, and
expectations) determines the substance and quality of the knowledge and under¬
standing gained.
The considerations just sketched may explain why Mesoamerican scholars
have failed to identify the Galactic Cosmology so blatantly present in Mesoamerica's
basic institutions. Science (based on the rational, linear, scrutinizing intellect) suf¬
fers from a limited perspective. Mesoamerican cosmology, on the other hand, is
derived from accessing the multidimensional capacity of the human mind and
soul, the multidimensional nature of reality. The academic model typically skirts
around the most profound, fundamental concepts of shamanistic cosmology, be¬
cause they simply do not fit into preconceived ideas of what is possible. The clos¬
est thing to the insights of Maya cosmology to be found in Western science in¬
volves quantum physics, with its concepts of Black Holes, wormholes, quasars,
and other strange space-time anomalies.8 As I demonstrated in Part III, these con¬
cepts are common in Maya Creation imagery. Ironically, the progressive theories
of quantum mechanics are hailed as advanced, recent discoveries. The Maya, how¬
ever, not only knew about quantum anomalies, they were able to conjure them up
at will and travel into them. They gazed deeply into the cosmic center, the Black
Hole in the center of our Galaxy, and to them the work of modern physics would
probably seem like child's play.
POLAR TO GALACTIC: THE EVOLUTION OF MESOAMERICAN
COSMOLOGY
We have traced the development of cosmology in Mesoamerica by understand¬
ing the primary interests of the peoples who migrated into the New World tens of
thousands of years ago. These cultures came from the Far North of the Asian conti¬
nent, from Mongolia, northern China, and Siberia. Ultimately, these transconti¬
nental ethnic migrations can be traced back to Central Asia, the traditional "cradle
of civilization."9 As we have seen, Neolithic cultures belonged to a common sub¬
strate of humanity that practiced shamanism. Shamans today living in China, Cen¬
tral Asia, and Siberia attest to an ancient cosmological and ritual paradigm that
understood the polar region to be the highest level of the celestial vault. They think



THE FORGOTTEN GALACTIC PARADIGM / 319
of it as a cosmic center, a natural conclusion because in the Far North the North
Celestial Pole is almost straight overhead.
Shamans undertook vision journeys into this cosmic center to retrieve
otherworldly knowledge and powers. The people who migrated east and south into
the Americas—forty-, twenty-, and ten-thousand years ago—probably all nurtured
this basic cosmological belief. As these groups eventually found themselves cross¬
ing into the tropical zone, into Mesoamerica and ultimately across the equator into
South America, their ancient polar paradigm must have undergone a transforma¬
tion. The further south they traveled toward the equator, the lower the North Ce¬
lestial Pole appeared to be in the sky. Being interested in the stars and a cosmic
center they could journey to, these cultures started to slowly revise their ancient
ideas. Mesoamerican cultures in particular probably noticed that another cosmic
center, the zenith, presented itself twice a year, at noon on the solar zenith-passage
dates. The solar zenith-passage dates suggested an alternative cosmic center, espe¬
cially relevant in the tropical zone, to which astronomer-priests could undertake
vision journeys twice a year. This center probably seemed ambiguous, however,
because the solar zenith-passage dates changed with their latitude of observation.
Meanwhile, at places like La Venta, early astronomers observed that the rise
times of circumpolar stars were slowly shifting. In other words, they became aware
of the slow shifting of the heavens,- they discovered precession. Based upon activity
at La Venta, I place this discovery at roughly 1200 b.c., after which the race was on
to accurately calculate the rate of precession. In order to calibrate precession, the
early skywatchers focused on the solstice sun's future entry into the Milky Way's
heart through the Underworld Road—the dark-rift near the cosmic crossroads. They
realized that precession exerts erratic effects on circumpolar stars, and that astro¬
nomical locations along the ecliptic exhibited the most consistent rate of shifting.
The Milky Way was chosen as the best background marker, for the Great Central
Bulge in the Milky Way, which lies along the ecliptic, was seen as a Creation Place,
the cosmic womb of the Great Mother. They had, in fact, discovered the Galactic
Center, which truly is our cosmic center and source, or, as the Maya would say, the
Heart of Sky.
The story of the evolution of cosmology in the Americas is the story of the
search for the ultimate cosmic center. The early cosmologists of Mesoamerica un¬
derstood that this was not only a place, but a time. And so they tracked the move¬
ment of the December solstice sun toward the Milky Way's womb, determined the



320 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
rate of precession, and revealed 13.0.0.0.0 as a unique moment of alignment be¬
tween human beings living on Earth and their cosmic heart and source. Thus, our
opening to the Galactic Center through the solstice doorway occurs in a.d. 2012.
As revealed by the Hero Twin Creation myth, the ancient Izapan shaman
astronomers recognized the polar region as false, as belonging to a previous World
Age during which a less comprehensive cosmological understanding prevailed. The
regents of the polar center, Seven Macaw (the Big Dipper) and his wife, Chimalmat
(the Little Dipper), reside in the polar region around which all the stars appear to
revolve. Seven Macaw, as a vain and false ruler, had to be done away with before the
true World Age ruler could be instated. This task fell to the Hero Twins. Once they
accomplished this deed, their father, One Hunahpu, was resurrected and recog¬
nized as the true cosmic ruler. Given the astronomical identification of One Hunahpu
as the December solstice sun, and the other clues decoded throughout this book,
his cosmic throne is the Galactic Center. That is where, after an eons-long proces¬
sion through the night sky, he finally takes his throne in the Heart of Sky. Mythol¬
ogy thus cryptically describes the astronomical alignment that culminates on the
2012 end-date, when the December solstice sun conjuncts the Galactic Center.
And so, Mesoamerican cosmology shifted from a polar orientation to a Galac¬
tic orientation. Appropriately enough, this ideological transformation occurred
during the transitional era between the Olmec and the Maya, during the height of
the Izapan civilization roughly 2,200 years ago. At the same time, the Long Count
calendar appeared, which is a Galactic Calendar because its end-date was anchored
to our impending alignment with the Galactic Center. The Hero Twin myth also
appeared at this time, carved on Izapa's monuments. We can regard the simulta¬
neous appearance of the Long Count and the Hero Twin myth as evidence for a
shift in cosmological perspective, an enhancement of knowledge, and a profound
development in the understanding of reality, time, and consciousness. In short,
the Izapan skywatchers dispensed with the false polar paradigm and formulated a
Galactic Cosmology that stimulated and informed the beginnings of Maya civili¬
zation.
ECSTATIC COMMUNION AS SOCIO-POLITICAL
ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE
Maya kings were shamans, and they embarked upon visionary journeys by



THE FORGOTTEN GALACTIC PARADIGM / 321
ingesting psychoactive plants. In fact, the highest Maya political office required
taking hallucinogens! The point of their endeavor was to travel to the outer limits
of the cosmos and return with an understanding of the "big picture." Like a Hindu
yogi, shamans could project their consciousness wherever they wished—into other
realities, other planes of being, other planets and dimensions. They could journey
back to the dawn of time, to the center and source of all life and being, and return
with power and wisdom. The Galactic Center was the goal of their journey, for
there the portal to infinity—the Grand Central Station of all beings and times
was located. Upon returning, the organizational reintegration that these adept kings
experienced had the effect of reorganizing their kingdoms. In other words, the king¬
dom responded empathetically with the king's own experience of reintegration af¬
ter having been blown out into eternity, and, like the order that emerges the mo¬
ment that temperature drops far enough for water to crystallize into ice, the king
effected a renewal of social order through his own "coming down." Thus, his royal
ecstatic communion with the cosmic source was essentially a socio-political act.
But how different this sensibility is from that of modern civilization. Imagine
the president of the United States taking psilocybin mushrooms ten hours before
giving the State of the Union Address! Scholars know that Maya rulers took mind¬
expanding plants, undertook vision journeys, and were glorified as great shamans,
but they have not explored the implications of this kind of socio-political system.
The reasons are many, not the least of which are fear of the unknown and the
current institutionalized anathema toward hallucinogens. And yet, looked at ob¬
jectively, the Mayas' use of such knowledge-bestowing tools is completely under¬
standable, even desirable. The leaders of society should be able to journey into the
deep psyche, to access the fount of all creativity and genius, to commune with the
ancestors and beings from other realms and times, and to deliver into their country
the organizational frequencies emanating from the cosmic source. Maya kings were
diviners, journeyers, channelers, and magicians, and they were the respected de¬
signers and leaders of a great civilization.
This situation, in which one worldview is incapable of appreciating the other,
clearly indicates an intractable problem. Something very basic to the Western
mindset prevents it from understanding the full profundity of Mesoamerican
cosmovision. Scholars can label Maya beliefs and practices, yet they completely
evade seeing what those beliefs actually mean. For example, scholars do not accept
that Maya shamans could actually journey to distant times and places. Scholars



322 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
phrase this as "Maya kings believed they could journey to distant locations." In
fact, the mental/spiritual capacity for consciousness projection is well-known in
the Hindu and Buddhist religions, as well as in most animistic worldviews. Why
should the Maya be exempt from such achievements? One begins to suspect that
the scientific mindset is really far behind the ancient multidimensional paradigms
of mysticism and shamanism, where the full potential of the human mind is al¬
lowed to manifest. To fully understand Maya culture and cosmology, we must ad¬
mit that the Maya king journeyed to distant places, communed with transcenden¬
tal wisdom, and periodically conjured his kingdom into being, sustaining it by re¬
newing it at specific nexus-points in the Long Count calendar.
THE GALACTIC COSMOLOGY IN MESOAMERICAN
INSTITUTIONS
I call the precession-caused astronomical convergence of the solstice sun with
the Galactic Center the "Galactic Cosmology." In the ancient Pre-Classic period,
the discovery of this World Age-ending celestial convergence engendered an entire
cosmology, as evidenced by its ubiquitous presence in several important
Mesoamerican institutions. It is not surprising that the cosmological discovery that
was encoded into the Long Count calendar and the Hero Twin myth served as a
foundation-template for many Mesoamerican concepts. Keeping in mind the asso¬
ciation of these mythic symbols with the solstice sun, the dark-rift, the crossroads,
and the Milky Way, let us review the most important manifestations of the Galac¬
tic Cosmology in Mesoamerican institutions:
• kingship rites of accession to the cosmic throne
• birthing symbols and concepts, both mythological and biological
• the conception and birth of the Hero Twins
• the cosmic symbolism of the Mesoamerican ballgame
• the resurrection of One Hunahpu
• the origin of maize and the birth of the Maize Deity
• monster mouth imagery as a "to be born" place
• the Milky Way as the Great Mother
Kingship symbology partakes of the end-date cosmology because the king was
enthroned upon the quadripartite crossroads, the celestial Creation Place signified



THE FORGOTTEN GALACTIC PARADIGM / 323
by the crossing point of the Milky Way and the ecliptic in Sagittarius. Birthing
symbology relates to the king's role as conjurer, and the cosmic birth canal was the
nearby dark-rift. The king's journey into the cosmic center was equivalent to re¬
birth within the Great Mother (the Milky Way). His procession to rulership up the
red carpet of the ecliptic reflected the solstice sun's slow precessional journey into
the throne-lap of the Galactic Center.
By now, we have already thoroughly explored the connections between the
traditions outlined here and the end-date astronomy, and there is no need to sum¬
marize. However, the cosmic symbolism of the ballgame is probably the most com¬
pelling manifestation of the Galactic Cosmology within an important Mesoamerican
institution, and I would like to muse on this connection a little further.
The Mesoamerican ballgame was not just a sport. It was a ceremonial replica¬
tion of Creation events in Maya cosmology. The ball symbolized the head of First
Father, One Hunahpu in the Popol Vuh, who represented the December solstice
sun. The ballcourt represented the Milky Way, and the dark-rift was the doorway to
the Underworld ballcourt. The goalring of the Mesoamerican ballgame symbolized
this doorway, which also was understood to be the birth canal of the Great Mother,
who was the Milky Way. Most importantly, the ballgame was performed as a ritual
form of sympathetic magic to aid the solstice sun's movement into rebirth within
the body of the Great Mother.
Although scholars interpret the ballgame to symbolize the annual rebirth of
the sun, the mythology and shamanistic rituals attending ballgame ceremonies
clearly reveal that the gameball and the goalring correspond to astronomical fea¬
tures involved in the World Age level of solar rebirth—the Galactic Alignment of
13.0.0.0.0. When the ball/sun finally went through the goalring, a sacrifice took
place. This is in keeping with the Mesoamerican idea that deity sacrifice must take
place before world renewal. In the ballgame myth, One Hunahpu is decapitated, his
head becomes the gameball, and, after the Hero Twins defeat the Lords of Dark¬
ness, he is resurrected in "the ballcourt graveyard" as the true World Age ruler. But
his anointing in the crown of heaven comes only upon the blessing of the Great
Milky Way Mother, for it is initiation into life within her cosmic body that bestows
the power of rulership.
Often, Maya kings themselves would play the ballgame, playing the role of a
Hero Twin or even One Hunahpu. Maya kings might even have offered to be sacri¬
ficed as a necessary measure to keep the convergence rolling. They wanted to facili



324/ MAYA COSMOGENE5I5 2012
tate the future dawning, and they strove to feed the deities of time so that a future
epoch of transformation could bathe the world in new life, enhanced to a new level
of being. They knew this was part of a cosmic plan, but also understood that they
must willingly and consciously participate in this celestial drama. And it was un¬
derstood to be a game, a play of yin and yang, a dance of ball and hoop, a deity dance
jumping over the Underworld Abyss to arrive in a new cycle of cosmic Creation.
The Maya kings were willing to die for the benefit of future generations, and we are
blessed to live during the era in which the cosmic gameball reaches its goal.
The Galactic Cosmology that centers on the events of 13.0.0.0.0 provides the
archetypal foundation-template for many important Mesoamerican institutions,
rituals, and concepts. Emerging as a profound cosmological discovery in the Izapan
era before the Maya arose, its exposition of the Galactic Center as a supreme socio¬
political organizing principle was adopted as a basic tenet by an entire civilization,
and it cast its influence over all of Mesoamerica.
13.0.0.0.0: THE ZERO TIME OF PRECESSION
On 13.0.0.0.0 in the Long Count calendar—what we call December 21, 2012
the Maya expected nothing short of the rebirth of the world. With great insight,
the Maya cosmologists anticipated this cosmogenesis event to be caused by the
movement of the solstice sun into alignment with the Milky Way, a movement
determined by the precession of the equinoxes. In Western astrology, the move¬
ment of the vernal (spring) equinox through the twelve zodiacal constellations
defines precessional ages, each of which lasts some 2,160 years. However, the
method of tracking precession in Western astrology is rather ambiguous because
the twelve zodiacal constellations are of different sizes, though each is given an
abstract conceptual span of 30°. In fact, the timing of our passage into the next
zodiacal age is subject to debate. Some writers have looked at this question very
closely and report that, in terms of precise astronomy, the Age of Aquarius will
not dawn for several centuries.
So, just when is the Zero Point of Western astrology? This question is impor¬
tant, for if precession is understood as a collective gestation of the human spirit, it
requires a birth moment in which the cumulative achievements of a 26,000-year
growth cycle come to fruition.10 Traditionally, Pisces is the last sign of the Western
zodiac, so might the Zero Time occur at the end of the Piscean Age? From one



THE FORGOTTEN GALACTIC PARADIGM / 325
perspective, the answer is no. Precessional motion, as we know, moves backward
through the zodiac, and a problem arises when we consider that the end of the Age
of Pisces occurs when the vernal point is actually at 0° Pisces, preparing to enter
29° Aquarius, rather than at the "last" degree of Pisces. However, perhaps we should
acknowledge a hidden intention within Western astrological tradition and take the
notion of Pisces as the last zodiacal age at face value. Doing so, Western astrology
proclaims that the Zero Time of precession is when the Age of Pisces—the "last"
zodiacal sign—ends, which would be sometime in the next two centuries. From
this perspective the Zero Time of Western astrology appears to be in general accord
with the Maya end-times.
However, Maya cosmology, because of its use of the Milky Way as a more
precise Zero Time target, gets us straight to the heart of the matter. Furthermore,
the dark-rift in the Milky Way provides an even more precise target. For the Maya,
it is the movement of one of the seasonal quarters into conjunction with this marker
that defines eras of transformation in human civilization. (The last time this oc¬
curred was 6,400 years ago, the dawn of Old World civilization, and it involved the
fall equinox.) For the Maya Galactic Cosmology, the precise astronomical "finish
line" is, as we will explore in the next chapter, the Galactic equator—the field
effect dividing line of the Milky Way. Overall, the Maya recognized the preces¬
sional cycle as the origin of Galactic Seasons that periodically bring us into align¬
ment with the Galactic Center, thereby catalyzing evolution on Earth.
As the seasonal anchor-point, the Maya chose the December solstice rather
than the March equinox of Western astrology. The reasoning behind this is under¬
standable. The December solstice is the "turnabout" time in the solar year, when
the year is reborn from darkness. It is thus the "Zero Point" of our solar season. It is
a time of direction change, renewal, rebirth, and increasing light and life. The equi¬
nox, on the other hand, is when the sun rises halfway between the solstice ex¬
tremes. Whereas the solstices are rest points, the equinox sun moves very quickly
along the horizon from day to day. Technically speaking, the sun's rate of declina¬
tion change is very rapid around the equinoxes (see Appendix 3). This makes for a
fast-paced energy dynamic in human affairs, a "gotta get there" syndrome. It thus
may be misleading to think of the March equinox as New Year's Day, because at
that time the sun is racing along, halfway through its journey from one extreme to
the other. Equinoxes are times of balance in activity, momentum, and mediation
whereas solstices are times of rest, renewal, and new beginnings. The December



326 / MAYA COSMOG E N ES I S 2012
solstice sun appeals to common sense as the time of renewal, the date of New
Year's Day. In fact, the creators of the Long Count regarded it as the beginning of
the next World Age, since 13.0.0.0.0 is a December solstice.
The end-date of the 13-baktun cycle of the Long Count calendar is an artifact
of an advanced and forgotten cosmology. It may represent the most advanced para¬
digm yet created by human beings. In this light, human civilization as a whole has
regressed, or, in other terminology, Western philosophy has yet to catch up with
the ancient Maya. Clearly, the Maya were advanced in ways that we in the West are
just beginning to understand. However, based upon the fact that the ancient Long
Count calendar pinpoints a rare alignment in the 26,000-year cycle of precession,
we can at least say that the Maya were correct in suggesting that 13.0.0.0.0, De¬
cember 21, 2012, is the appropriate Zero Time nexus of the Great Year of preces¬
sion. Being the culmination of an ages-long quest for understanding the nature of
time, Maya cosmological insights are reminding us that the Zero Time is upon us.

BACK TO THE CENTER:
THE MESSAGE OF THE MAYA END-DATE
B
ased upon insights gathered while in altered states of consciousness, the an¬
cient skywatchers wove an amazing calendric cosmology around the Galactic
Center, a cosmology encoded into the Long Count calendar. This is why I call the
Long Count calendar a Galactic calendar, and the resultant philosophical model a
Galactic Cosmology. But what does the 2012 alignment mean for human beings on
Earth? In general, the solstice sun will be in conjunction with the great bulge of the
Galactic Center, which we can understand as a rare conjunction of Earth, the local
sun, and the Galactic heart. More importantly, however, in a.d. 2012 the solstice
meridian will cross over the Galactic equator.1
The Galactic equator is the astronomical term for the dividing line of the Milky
Way band, separating the left and right "lobes" of the sky, similar to how the Earth's
equator divides the Earth into two hemispheres. On Earth, we experience distinct
field-effect properties on the two sides of the equator. For example, water spins
down the drain counterclockwise north of the equator, and clockwise south of the
equator. Likewise, hurricanes and tornadoes in the Southern Hemisphere spin in
the opposite direction of those in the Northern Hemisphere. These effects involve
gyroscopic conservation of angular momentum, what we might call field-dynamic
reversals. Any spinning body will exhibit these properties, and there is no reason to
deny that the same phenomenon holds true for the Milky Way. On the Galactic
level, the Milky Way's equator, like the Earth's equator, is the field-effect dividing
327

line. As with a spinning magnetic top, the field effects on one side are different
from those on the other, and Maya insights offer us the notion that a field-effect
reversal occurs when the solstice meridian crosses over this line. In other words, in
2012 the Earth's orientation, as defined by the solstice meridian, passes through a
paradoxical null-point, much like the calm eye of a hurricane balances the sur¬
rounding chaos.
The "energy" field emanates from the Galactic Center and includes the entire
electromagnetic/photon field in which our planet exists. There are dimensions of
subtlety within this field—the telluric or astral realms—extending beyond the physi¬
cal forces of science to include spiritual planes of being. If we imagine this field as
being similar to the lines of force surrounding a magnet, we can understand that
our changing orientation to this field has immediate consequences, and has little to
do with cause-and-effect transmission of energy between us and the Galactic Cen¬
ter. We are, instead, in a relationship of resonance with our source, one that con¬
nects us deeply within to each other, and, in fact, to all other beings in this Galaxy.
Based upon these considerations, I would like to emphasize that the Galactic equa¬
tor—the precise edge of our spiraling Galaxy—is the Zero Point location of the
turnabout moment in the cycle of precession. This World Age shift occurs when
the solstice sun crosses over the Galactic equator, and thus the Galactic Alignment
in 2012 is about a field-effect energy reversal.
But what does this mean for life on Earth? What kind of field effects will be
present on Earth during the 2012 alignment? And what occurs when the solstice
meridian transitions to the other side? As suggested by the spinning-hurricane



BACK TO THE CENTER: THE MESSAGE OF THE MAYA END-DATE / 329
metaphor, our basic orientations will be inverted. On the level of human civiliza¬
tion, our basic assumptions and foundational values will be exposed, and we will
have the opportunity to embrace values long since driven under the surface of our
collective consciousness. When a given set of rules and assumptions has run its
course, and has led civilization to the end of a particular road, the opposite orienta¬
tion begins to appear. The full manifestation of one style of human expression thus
gives way, like the old year gives way to the new, to a fresh style based upon a
completely opposite set of values and assumptions. This polarization is beautifully
symbolized by the Chinese Tai-Chi symbol, which is very similar to a Mesoamerican
design commonly referred to as Hunab
Ku, from the Nuttall Codex.
Both of these symbols portray a pro¬
cess-oriented transformation from one
extreme to the other that occurs on many
levels of reality, from night changing into
day to the evolution of values in a civili¬
zation. In terms of the spiritual evolu¬
tion of human beings, this metaphor
evokes eras of darkness giving way to eras
of light, the eternal battle between igno¬
rance and consciousness, and we can thus begin to understand the 2012 field-rever¬
sal as a moment in which the human spirit can emerge from unconscious patterns
and blossom. The Swiss psychologist Carl Jung called this process of reversal
enantiodiomia. On the level of civilization, enantiodromia occurs over relatively
brief periods of cultural chaos, and cultural transformation affects peoples' spiri¬
tual values, as well as the scientific and philosophical underpinnings of society's
thinkers and policy makers. During these eras of social change, a polarization of
values occurs, opposite camps define themselves and pull apart, each forming a
new set of values, belief systems, and philosophies.
These are complex evolutionary processes ruled by the universal principles of
birth, growth, and death, but we can imagine what this process of polarization is
moving toward if we draw from a cellular metaphor. During cell mitosis, one cell
pulls itself apart and divides into two cells,- a previous cellular "oneness" is breached,
and breached again, and yet again, as the cells continuously divide to form new,
whole cells. At first, cellular splitting may appear degenerative because stability is
©

and Hunab Ku



330 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
lost and wholeness is constantly breached. However, this "breaking apart" of cell
mitosis inaugurates embryogenesis, the most miraculous and transformative growth
process of human becoming. In other words, cell mitosis is a splitting process that
results in the seemingly blind generation of more cells that, however, is driven by
an inner ordering program designed to create one unified being, on a higher level
a level beyond the dimension of the cell. If we apply this cellular metaphor to the
level of human civilization and the evolution of human consciousness, periods of
historical transformation during which polarization occurs signal the germination
of a higher being, and the possible union of polarized camps on a higher level.
The Maya understood the principle of enantiodromia and believed it was driven
by our changing orientation to the field-effects of the Galaxy. The 260-day tzolkin
calendar is based upon the 260-day period of human embryogenesis, and, on a higher
level, the 260-day tzolkin symbolizes, or structures, the 26,000-year period of pre¬
cession, what we might call human spiritual embryogenesis. The Maya believed
that the 26,000-year Great Year of precession is a spiritual gestation period for hu¬
manity, and that the 2012 alignment will catalyze the birth of what has been grow¬
ing on this planet for 26,000 years. For the Maya, Father Sun's movement into
union with Cosmic Mother's heart also signified the insemination, or seeding, of
what will come to fruition in 26,000 years. The 2012 era is about the birth of some¬
thing new on this planet, but it is also a death, the rupture of the womb-world that
held us comfortably warm for millennia, unaware of the larger world outside of our
limited sights.
On small or local levels of manifestation—in cultural revivals and in religious
movements for example—the historical process of polarization has occurred be¬
fore, but the 2012 era represents a global reversal. On a literal level of interpreta¬
tion, one supported by many popular writers, the field-effect reversal that mystics
and futurists intuitively feel occurring on this planet bodes an impending pole shift,
a literal shift in the position of the Earth's North Celestial Pole, an event that would
have disastrous effects around the globe. According to geologists, pole shifts indeed
have occurred in the past; and if we are due for one now, I suppose there is not
much we can do about it. Visions of apocalypse, however, may originate more in
erroneous notions of linear time combined with fears implanted by our own Judeo
Christian conditioning than in reality. As a result of my studies of Maya end-date
cosmology, I prefer to emphasize what might be termed a pole shift in our collec¬
tive psyche. This places the possibility of successful, positive transformation squarely



BACK TO THE CENTER: THE MESSAGE OF THE MAYA END-DATE / 331
in our own hands. What I suspect this is about is already underway—a shift from
the dominator mode so characteristic of our civilization to a partnership style. So¬
cial historian Riane Eisler emphasizes that these terms—dominator and partner¬
ship—refer to an opposed orientation in terms of cultural values, rather than quali¬
ties intrinsic to patriarchy (males) and matriarchy (females).2 Her distinction is im¬
portant, for if patriarchy upholds the values of hierarchical dominance and
territorialism, matriarchy is the exact same style of organization except with women,
rather than men, at the top of the hierarchy. Both are dominator modes of social
orientation. According to Eisler, the partnership mode, on the other hand, upholds
the values of relationship, cocreation, and life-affirmation through partnership with
nature and other human beings. The partnership mode does not "belong" to the
female principle any more than the dominator mode belongs to the male.
Western or Euro-American civilization currently rules the globe through domi¬
nator forms of coercion and resource control. This style of being-in-the-world can
be traced back to the early city-states of Sumer, the very beginnings of the current
chapter in Earth's history. Before Sumer, however, early ceremonial sites such as
£atal Huyiik in Central Turkey reveal that a very different social style prevailed in
late Neolithic times, one that worshiped the Great Mother as the supreme life
principle and that honored relationship over status, partnership rather than domi¬
nation. The Anatolian culture of the seventh millennium b.c. represented a part¬
nership ideal with roots extending far back into the Paleolithic. Research by ar¬
chaeologist Marija Gimbutas demonstrated that the Magdalenian culture of an¬
cient Europe, which thrived more than 19,000 years ago, was linked with distant
trade centers, worshiped the Great Mother, and may have had a form of glyphic
writing.3
Clearly, our distant ancestors participated in a style of culture that is funda¬
mentally antithetical to our own. And the pendulum of enantiodromia is swinging,
pulling us out of ingrained habits, and stimulating a renaissance of an ancient para¬
digm that may be our only salvation. Western civilization is now confronting its
own shadow in the form of global pollution, institutionalized corporate greed, and
political instability. Fortunately, social upheavels and changes in the last thirty
years indicate that we already appear to be moving in a direction that celebrates co¬
creation, relationship, and working together rather than violence, conquest, and
force. In this emerging paradigm, we are indispensible cocreators of the post-shift
world. The real pole shift may thus be about a shift in our fundamental orientation



332 / MAYA COSMOOEN ESIS 2012
to each other and to the world, stimulated by our recommitment to life-affirming
values. To go forward on our journey to collective wholeness, we must abandon our
illusions and return to the center, back to rejuvenation within the Great Mother,
our cosmic heart and source.
This book ends with a departure, for, having been led through the gate of Ga¬
lactic initiation to the threshold of a new world, a new beginning opens to us, filled
with its own challenges and joys. The Maya understood that human civilization
cycles from one extreme form of social organization to the other. Out of this pro¬
cess of polarization, or spiritual mitosis, arises a new, greater being. Every time the
cosmic cell divides, every 26,000 years, we are one step closer to the birth of that
vast higher being of which we are just cells. Our committed, willing participation
in the galactic processes of Maya cosmogenesis, recognizing our place in the great
chain of creation, is what enobles our souls and elevates our spirits to a plane in¬
fused with unity and relationship. The opening doorway of baktun thirteen offers
us conscious relationship with each other and a creative participation with the
Earth-process that gives birth to our higher selves.

APPENDIX 1
A BRIEF HISTORY OF AN
I
do not claim to have made the initial dis¬
covery that an alignment of the solstice
meridian with the Galaxy looms before us,
but I do feel I have provided original insights
into how it is connected with Maya calen¬
dar tradition and have elucidated its many
manifestations in Mesoamerican cosmology
quite clearly. The Galactic Alignment is an
important astronomical event that, I believe,
will be talked about a great deal in the up¬
coming years. As with the simultaneous in¬
vention of the telephone in distant areas,
unrelated by cause and effect, the cosmologi
cally potent concept of Galactic Alignment
is an idea whose time has come, or, shall we
say, has reemerged. Many people may lay
claim to prior discovery of this phenomenon,
which I feel is besides the point, because it
was the early Maya who discovered it more
than 2,000 years ago. My early contribution
to elucidating the Mayas' discovery of a fu¬
ture Galactic Alignment was recognizing
that the xibalba be, the Sacred Tree, and One
Hunahpu/First Father were mythological
keys to understanding the astronomy of the
13-baktun cycle end-date. Beyond this, my
research unraveled large amounts of addi¬
tional evidence, resulting in the reconstruc¬
tion of a lost paradigm that I term the Galac¬
tic Cosmology. In the interest of clarity, I will
reconstruct as thoroughly as possible how my
encounter with the Maya Galactic Cosmol¬
ogy unfolded.
The earliest source that recognized (in¬
directly) the alignment of the solstice "co¬
lure" with the era of a.d. 2000 was Hamlet’s
Mill. This is not surprising, seeing how the
authors, Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha
IDEA
von Dechend, were very interested in pre¬
cession. However, they do not connect this
with the Maya Long Count end-date. They
speak frequently of the last time, some 6,400
years ago, when the Milky Way coincided
with one of the seasonal quarters (the fall
equinox). Frank Waters' book Mexico Mys¬
tique sourced material from Hamlet’s Mill,
and was concerned with exploring the "as¬
trological" nature of the end-date, but failed
to mention the era-2000 a.d. alignment sug¬
gested in Hamlet’s Mill. As a result, no con¬
nection was made with the Maya. This is un¬
fortunate, because if Waters had put this on
the table for examination in 1975, we might
be a lot further along in understanding how
this key idea operated in Mesoamerican cos¬
mology. (Waters used an erroneous end-date
of December 24, 2011 a.d., sourced from an
early edition of Michael Coe's book The
Maya.) Next, the authors of the 1975 edition
of The Invisible Landscape, Dennis Mc¬
Kenna and Terence McKenna, quoted from
Hamlet’s Mill and placed the end of the pos¬
ited timewave in the year a.d. 2012 (174). A
brief discussion of the Galactic Center, pre¬
cession, and the alignment circa 2012 is on
pages 189-190. However, at this point, the
Maya were not mentioned, though they were
in the 1993 edition. The McKennas became
aware of a possible connection between the
solstice-Galaxy alignment and the Maya cal¬
endar end-date in the mid-1970s.
During the 1980s there were only indi¬
rect or partial references to this idea. Norton’s
2000.0 star atlas clearly shows the alignment
of the solstice meridian with the Galactic
equator (the centerline of the Milky Way
335



336 / MAYA COSMOGENE5IS 2012
band) and astronomers must encounter this
fact as a matter of course. However, connect¬
ing it to the Maya end-date in 2012 is an¬
other thing altogether. Major discoveries can
stare you in the face for years before they
flower. Basing his finding on the Norton’s
2000.0 star atlas, Nick Kollerstrom wrote a
short "article particle" in Mountain Astrolo¬
ger (August-September 1993) mentioning the
solstice axis alignment with the Milky Way
"in a.d. 2000." Futurist Moira Timms men¬
tioned the solstice/Galaxy alignment "in
1999" in her book Beyond Prophecies and
Predictions, but not in relation to the Maya
calendar.
In my correspondence with Terence Mc¬
Kenna in mid-1993, the idea again came up
regarding the solstice/Galaxy alignment be¬
ing at the heart of the Maya calendar. Look¬
ing over some star charts that summer, I be¬
came convinced that something was defi¬
nitely going on. In early 1994 I understood
the importance of some incredibly provoca¬
tive comments in Dennis Tedlock's Popol
Vuh translation that indicated the crossing
point of the Milky Way and the ecliptic in
Sagittarius as a significant astronomical place
recognized in Maya myth. I put two and two
together and more pieces of a compelling
cosmological puzzle started fitting into place.
The dark-rift in the Milky Way, known to
the Maya as the Road to the Underworld, was
particularly relevant. In addition, something
Tedlock said in the 1993 Parabola magazine
interview had stuck with me: Maya Creation
occurs at a celestial crossroads.
In May of 1994, I began to think this
puzzle through, and located my astronomy
software (EZCosmos 3.1) so I could model
this thing. With Norton’s 2000.0 as a second¬
ary reference guide (for precisely locating the
Milky Way and its dark-rift), I was shocked
to find the December solstice sun of a.d. 2012
directly in the dark-rift, at the precise junc¬
tion of the Milky Way and the ecliptic! This
was the first time anyone had identified Maya
mythlore and cosmological concepts to ar¬
gue for the Maya's intentional placement of
13.0.0.0.0 on the solstice/Galaxy alignment.
The synchronization of calendar and as¬
tronomy, combined with meaningfully sup¬
portive Maya concepts, was probably not
coincidental. So, who did create the Long
Count? And when? These were the next
questions I asked, and I knew that the an¬
swers were generally known within aca¬
demia. In a flurry, I did research at the local
university library and kept encountering
more support for my suspicions. Surveying
specialized studies in Maya myth and as¬
tronomy, I began to see Izapa as the likely
birthplace of the cosmic knowledge encoded
in the Long Count calendar.
In May, I completed an article describing
this discovery and submitted it to Mountain
Astrologer magazine, where it was accepted
for publication in the December 1994 issue.
Meanwhile, in August of 1994 astrologer
R. Mardyks published a brief mention of the
galactic astrology and the 2012 date in
Sedona magazine. As an astrologer, Mardyks
distinguishes an astrological difference be¬
tween the precise solstice/Galaxy alignment
"of 1999" and the 13-baktun cycle end-date
of 2012, and, therefore, in personal correspon¬
dence with me (January 1998) he has dis¬
agreed with my interpretation that the Maya
intended their 2012 end-date to mark the
Galactic Alignment. My own interpretation
follows common sense in allowing for at
least a thirteen-year range for precessional
calculations, and thus I emphasize that the
Maya did, indeed, intend their 2012 end-date
to mark the solstice-Galaxy alignment.
In late 19941 noticed an article by astrono¬
mer Dawn Jenkins posted on a Maya as¬
tronomy website that mentioned the coinci¬
dence of the December solstice sun with the



APPENDIX 1. A BRIEF HISTORY OF AN IDEA / 337
Milky Way. Later, she told me that she had
presented this same article to her astronomy
club in Ohio in early 1994. So, the word was
out while my article was in press. Since I do
not claim intellectual ownership of this dis¬
covery, I do not think this is even a question
of who "discovered" it first. The questions
are: How can we understand this? What are
the deeper implications? How does this cos¬
mology manifest in other Maya traditions,
such as the ballgame? What does it mean for
us today? My initial interest was in clarify¬
ing how the ancient skywatchers of Meso
america figured it all out, and how they in¬
corporated it into their mythology, cosmol¬
ogy, and culture. Having done that, more re¬
cently I have turned to exploring the philo¬
sophical implications of the alignment (see
Chapters 24 and 25). Ultimately, I have come
to realize that the cosmological discovery of
a future alignment with the Galactic Center
was the core insight and primus motor of
Maya civilization.
My Mountain Astrologer article (1994)
received recognition from widely diverse
quarters. Astrologer Bruce Scofield men¬
tioned it in his book Signs of Time (1994:203).
(He had read an advance copy of it.) Barbara
Hand Clow related my findings regarding the
advanced details of the alignment in her book
The Pleiadian Agenda (1995). Terence Mc¬
Kenna posted my 1994 Mountain Astrologer
article on his Hyperborea website. Wolfram
Oehler (1996a and 1996b), a researcher in
Germany, translated some of my work into
German and has written articles about the
2012 alignment based upon my research.
Kenneth Johnson (1997:176) wrote of my ar¬
ticle in his book Jaguar Wisdom. Mathema¬
tician and Maya scholar Stephen Eberhart at
California State University, Riverside, men¬
tioned my work in class workbooks devoted
to ancient calendars, astronomy, and math¬
ematics. Other scholars have also com¬
mented on my research into Maya cosmol¬
ogy. For example, in personal correspondence
Anthony Aveni wrote that he appreciated
"new insights" in "A Hawk, a Cross, and a
Mouth" (see Chapter 14).
In 1997, astrologer James A. Roylance
wrote an interesting article called "Galactic
Alignments" that appeared in The Astrologi¬
cal Journal. In it, Roylance discussed the pre¬
cession of the equinoxes and the astronomy
behind the impending alignment of the sol¬
stice meridian with the Galactic equator. He
related the precessional movement of the
vernal point away from the galactic plane as
an alienation from attunement to the greater
cosmic picture. In his interpretation, this
explains the rise of Monotheism—the "wor¬
ship of a disembodied God"—over the last
6,000 years. Consequently, the arrival of the
Age of Aquarius, which Roylance measures
with the impending Galactic Alignment,
marks the beginning of the vernal point's
return to the Galactic homebase (the Galac¬
tic plane), thus "calling forth a fundamental
realignment of the human psyche." Interest¬
ingly, Roylance also notes that three constel¬
lations (of Western astrology) appear to point
to the Galactic Center. He also provides a
mathematical analysis of when the solstice
meridian's alignment with the Galactic equa¬
tor will be most precise. Given the neces¬
sary margin of error, precession will bring the
"Galactic angles" onto the "seasonal (cardi¬
nal) cusps" between February 1998 and No¬
vember 1999. The lunar mansions of ancient
Vedic astrology also appear to indicate the
Galactic Center as a "root" or starting point
of time (Frawley 1991:343).
In April 1997, I discovered a book by
Michio Kushi called Visions of a New World:
The Era of Humanity. Two chapters, "The
Ancient World" and "The Future World,"
presented ideas about the precession of the
equinoxes and the way it changes our rela



338 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
tionship to the Milky Way. Kushi wrote that
the Earth's polar axis will be oriented toward
the Milky Way in about a.d. 8500. The band
of the Milky Way is understood to be a field
of energy, and when our Earth's axis is so
aligned, Kushi proposed that energy cascades
through the vertical (north-south) axis and
affects weather patterns and life on Earth.
Kushi's ideas are fascinating and ahead of
their time, presenting a compelling mecha¬
nism to explain how our precession-caused
changing relationship with the Milky Way
can affect life on Earth. He sees evidence for
ancient knowledge of this cosmology in Rev¬
elations and in the Taoist I-Ching philoso¬
phy. In fact, he sees the epic ups and downs
of human history to be intrinsically related
to our changing relationship to the Milky
Way. However, he does not mention the
alignment of the solstice meridian with the
Galactic equator circa a.d. 2012. Neverthe¬
less, Kushi's ideas should be acknowledged
as a very early foray into an amazing and very
ancient Galactic Cosmology.



APPENDIX 2
MESOAMERICAN PRECESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE:
IN THE LITERATURE
D
id the Maya know about precession?
What kind of mythological motifs char¬
acterize knowledge of precession? Where do
we begin our search for precessional knowl¬
edge? Armed with the strong circumstantial
evidence, supplied by the nature of the Long
Count end-date, that the Maya tracked pre¬
cession, we should expect to find concrete
evidence uncovered by other researchers. In
fact, there is a fair amount of discussion of
this topic in the academic literature. Let us
take a look at what several Maya scholars
have said about this topic.
Gregory Severin published his analysis of
the Paris Codex with The American Philo¬
sophical Society in 1981. The Paris Codex,
one of four surviving Mayan books, contains
a thirteen-sign zodiac. Herbert Spinden first
pointed this out back in 1916, but the idea
has not until recently generated a great deal
of commentary. Now, many scholars, includ¬
ing David Kelley (1989), Meredith Paxton
(1992), Linda Scheie (in Freidel et al. 1993),
and Victoria Bricker and Harvey Bricker
(1992) are advancing hypotheses to explain
the details of this Maya zodiac. Their work
is supporting the concept that the Maya uti¬
lized spatial divisions of the ecliptic, and
therefore had a type of sidereal astronomy.
Gregory Severin's theory was quite different.
The premise of his monograph is that the
thirteen signs of the Paris Codex delineate
zodiacal ages, each being a division of the
26,000-year precessional cycle. The entry
from one zodiacal age to the next was marked
by the vernal point (the spring equinox) mov¬
ing into a new sign. The symbol for this equi¬
nox position is, according to Severin, one that
was formerly thought to represent eclipses.
Severin's study is ambitious, insightful in
certain respects, but ultimately flawed.
Severin may have held too many Western as¬
tronomical assumptions in analyzing this
data (for example, that the vernal point must
be the marker), and the Maya may have con¬
ceived of things in a way quite alien to our
expectations. Michael Closs, associate pro¬
fessor of mathematics at the University of
Ottawa, reviewed Severin's monograph in an
essay entitled "Were the Ancient Maya Aware
of Precession?" (1983). It immediately seems
unlikely that Closs will be able to answer the
title question simply by refuting one re¬
searcher's work. In his concise seven-page
review/essay, Closs pointed out flaws in Se¬
verin's analysis and therefore concludes, re¬
garding the blanket question of precessional
knowledge, that "After reviewing the evi¬
dence in Severin's work, this writer remains
unconvinced and in his judgment the answer
is no" (170). However, Closs's final statement
may be a case of throwing the baby out with
the bathwater, for he cannot possibly con¬
clude the ancient Maya were ignorant of pre¬
cession simply because a modern interpreter
of one of their documents made errors.
The prolific researcher David Kelley
(1983a) was less skeptical. In his review of
Severin's study, he wrote that Severin ad¬
equately demonstrated that the Paris Codex
could have been used to calculate precession,
providing a "good but not overwhelming
339



340 / MAYA COSMOCENESI5 2012
case" (S70). Despite pointing out several of
Severin's errors, he concluded that "scholars
will be led to new insights" by Severin's work
"for years to come."
Other Maya scholars commenting on
ancient precessional knowledge support it
directly. Gordon Brotherston, Mesoamerican
scholar and author of The Book of the Fourth
World, considers the evidence to be clear. A
very interesting discussion in this book be¬
gins with the topic "World Ages and Meta¬
morphosis." The concept of "Suns" or World
Ages is central to Maya as well as Aztec cos¬
mology. In the Popol Vuh, a total of four ages
are laid out, and the first three have already
ended in destruction. The efforts of the Hero
Twins are designed, in part, to facilitate the
removal of the "false" world ruler Seven
Macaw, and to install One Hunahpu/First
Father as the true god. Aztec cosmology, the
best representation of which is carved on the
so-called Aztec Sunstone, describes five ages.
The center of this monumental calendar
stone is the "ollin" symbol of movement, the
quincunx symbol that illustrates four ages
at the four corners united in the center, the
fifth age. According to Aztec cosmology, we
live in the Fifth Age, the age of "move¬
ment"—symbolized by the seventeenth
day-sign of the tzolkin—and our age will be
destroyed by earthquake.
Brotherston considered the Creation
myth in the Popol Vuh to be closely linked,
via basic doctrinal content, to later stories
that emerged in Central Mexico. Further¬
more, Brotherston revealed how great cycles
of time are evident in many native cosmol¬
ogies. For example, there is the 60,000-year
glacier cycle known to the Mapuche people;
"millions of years" are said to have elapsed
in the narrative of the Witoto Indians; a
73,000-year period in Chimalpahin's Seventh
Revelation; and spans of 80,000 years are still
counted out by the Tzotzil Maya. According
to Brotherston, the "indispensible concept"
in these doctrines is the 26,000-year preces¬
sion of the equinoxes. Brotherston acknowl¬
edged what should be self-evident in studies
of any cultural history: Precessional knowl¬
edge leads to a doctrine of World Ages.
But Brotherston did not rely on vague gen¬
eralities as proof of his belief that Meso¬
american astronomers were aware of preces¬
sion. He pointed out the .242-day discrepancy
between the 365-day haab and the synodic
seasonal calendar (365.242 days). The .242
day difference amounts to a year every 1,507
years. (I corrected obvious numerical typos
in Brotherston's book [1992: 298-299]. These
errors have to do with his rounding off the
values for the "synodic seasonal calendar"
and the "sidereal year of the stars." His ob¬
servation that the .014-day difference
amounts to precession is still accurate and
correct.) According to Brotherston, the .014
day precession formula also is found in the
Mexicanus Codex of Central Mexico. The
sidereal year of the stars is 365.256 days, and
this .256-day difference measured, again,
against the 365-day haab amounts to one day
over 1,427 years, and this interval is marked
in the Tepexic Annals of Central Mexico. As
Brotherston explained, the .014-day differ¬
ence between these two formulas corre¬
sponds to precession, and amounts to a year
in just under 26,000 years, and this time span
is indicated in the Aztec Sunstone as well as
the Rios Codex from Tenochtitlan. Bro¬
therston's analysis is rigorous, well informed,
and it has the authority of respected scholar¬
ship behind it.
In an article entitled "The Year 3113 b.c.
and the Fifth Sun of Mesoamerica: An Ortho¬
dox Reading of the Tepexic Annals," Bro¬
therston analyzed the glyphic content of the
Aztec Sunstone. He noticed that the length
of the Four Ollin era is recorded on the rim of
the Sunstone in ten lots of numbered Rounds.



APPENDIX 2. MESOAMERICAN PRECESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE / 341
The iconography and conventional style of
recording "bundles" as time-periods indicates
a total of 20,800 years for the first four eras,
and 5,200 years for the present era. This to¬
tals 26,000 years for a complete Era Cycle. In
the Cauahtitlan Annals' transcription of the
Sunstone cosmology, four-fifths of the "Great
Year" is noted as "CCCC Mixcoa," which is
400 cloud-snake rounds, or 20,800 years (400
x 52). The Rios Codex contains five World
Ages that total, according to Brotherston, "a
little less than 26,000 years." Implicit in these
number systems is the final figure of 26,000
years, obviously indicating knowledge of pre¬
cession. (See Brotherston 1992:298-302 for the
full argument.)
Eva Hunt's book The Transformation of
the Hummingbird contributed to defining
the relationships between Mesoamerican
myth and astronomy. Like scholars before
her, she identified Tezcatlipoca with the
North Celestial Pole, but Hunt added new
insights to the discussion. Tezcatlipoca, it
will be recalled, was a multifaceted god who
had only one leg. Thus, he is envisioned spin¬
ning about the pole of the ecliptic. The four
faces of Tezcatlipoca, according to Hunt, rep¬
resent four eras or "Suns" defined by the
changing Pole Stars that appear over long
periods of time. Of course, the phenomenon
that causes the Pole Star to move and, in fact,
be replaced by other nearby stars is the pre¬
cession of the equinoxes. Hunt writes, "The
changing of the position of the celestial pole,
due to the equinoctial precession that
changes the polestar and the planetary
orbitings, was expressed in the complicated
myths of Tezcatlipoca's transformations"
(152). She goes on to suggest that a careful
reading of pre-Hispanic myths would "pro¬
vide us with a series of prehispanic counts of
dated events in the equinoctial precession"
(152). She cites the different identities of Tez¬
catlipoca as evidence for this, finding that
"his divine 'movement' or 'change' (that is,
the change of the position of the northern
polar center from one star to another) was
recorded in written form in the Historia de
los Mexicanos por sus Pinturas, in the six¬
teenth century" (152-153). The myths ana¬
lyzed all reveal four eras or Suns (changing
Pole Stars), and the fifth Pole Star era is then
thought to be the current one. These ideas
are reiterated in another Central Mexican
myth called the Legend of the Suns.
Hunt's ideas are startling, clearly provid¬
ing an interpretive foundation for under¬
standing precessional mythology in many
Mesoamerican sources. Although her book
was reviewed by several Mesoamerican schol¬
ars (e.g., Gossen 1982), they did not comment
on this important information.
The Milky Way is an unambiguous par¬
tition of the ecliptic. If the thirteen-sign zo¬
diac in the Paris Codex implies the use of a
type of sidereal astronomy, we would expect
that one of the constellation divisions would
be right at the Milky Way. Three different
placements are offered by three different re¬
searchers: Severin in his monograph, Scheie
in Maya Cosmos, and the Brickers in The
Sky in Mayan Literature. One of the divi¬
sion points between zodiacal constellations
in the Paris Codex is given by Victoria
Bricker and Harvey Bricker as December 3
in the era a.d. 750 to a.d. 770. They call this
the "second" constellation, and it begins
within 1° of the Galactic equator in Sagit¬
tarius, on the xibalba be. In other words,
according to the Brickers' model, the Galac¬
tic equator cuts right through one of the di¬
visions of the thirteen-sign zodiac in the
Paris Codex. The Paris Codex constellation
in question is the rattlesnake, suggesting a
polarity between Scorpio (dark-rift as snake
mouth) and the Pleiades (rattlesnake's rattle)
that is recognized in indigenous cosmologies
of Mesoamerica and South America. This in



342 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
formation is very suggestive, and Maya con¬
cepts of stellar mansions need to be exam¬
ined more carefully to find evidence (in ad¬
dition to Kelley 1989) that the Milky Way
was thought of as an astronomical dividing
line or beginning point for time. To this end,
the Madrid Codex would probably be a use¬
ful source.
Calendar experts have identified the 13
baktun cycle's midpoint (April 17, 551 b.c.,
6.10.0.0.1) as the most likely date on which
the Long Count was officially installed. Ac¬
cording to Mesoamerican scholar Robert
Hall (1989-1993a), April 17 is close to the
day, in era 551 b.c., when the sun conjuncted
the Pleiades. As we know, this conjunction
date changes with precession so that cur¬
rently the sun conjuncts the Pleiades on May
20. Hall therefore suggested that among the
ancient skywatchers there was "a concern
for the day on which the sun was at the lon¬
gitude of the Pleiades in each century, mov¬
ing through April and into May one day each
71 years with the precession of the equi¬
noxes. Mechanisms such as these certainly
were in effect" (121). Hall clearly implies
here that the Long Count was inaugurated
in 551 b.c. to track the precession-caused
changing dates of "sun conjunct Pleiades"
through the centuries.
Hall's essay is well-argued and researched,
but his use of the Pleiades as a background
feature against which precession was tracked
makes sense only if the date is measured
against a seasonal quarter. In other words, as
shown in my foreground-background model
of precession tracking (Part I), one needs the
"anchored" dates of the seasonal quarters (or
the zenith-passage dates) to measure sidereal
shifting. At any rate, counting the days to
the nearest seasonal quarter is a simple af¬
fair. Apart from this, Hall's scenario is in ef¬
fect very similar to the one I present in my
Zenith Cosmology. If Hall's thesis is correct,
and it may be, then adjustments within the
Calendar Round framework may have been
used as a means of tracking precession. This
probably became the New Fire institution
(see Chapter 7).
The modern Yucatec Maya shaman Hun
batz Men stated that the sun travels around
the Pleiades once every 26,000 years. On the
surface this sounds absurd, but let us remem¬
ber that the Maya often see things quite dif¬
ferently; when they look at the moon, and
half of it is there, they call it a half moon.
Modern astronomy calls that a quarter moon,
because it is one-fourth of the way through
its full cycle. Who is right? Both are. What I
call observational astronomy is quite literal.
Hunbatz Men's statement might make more
sense if we add to it "the spring equinox sun
travels around the Pleiades once every 26,000
years." Here we have a description of Hall's
hypothesis, relayed to us by a "New Age"
Maya shaman. It is true, the position of the
spring equinox sun against the background
of stars, in relation to the Pleiades, will
slowly circle around the zodiac once every
26,000 years. We needed to anchor the sun
to a position in the solar year—the spring
equinox—for the statement to make sense.
As for my end-date scenario, the answer to
which sun approaches the xibalba be is the
December solstice sun (the first day of the
seasons) or, in mythological terms, One
Hunahpu/First Father.
This brief survey of the academic litera¬
ture on the precession question, as well as
additional information contained in Part I,
demonstrates that many Maya scholars be¬
lieve the ancient Maya were tracking preces¬
sion. Given the level of astronomical sophis¬
tication possessed by the ancient Mesoameri¬
can astronomers, and the May as' well-known
obsession with time, it would be surprising
if Maya astronomers did not notice and then
accurately calculate precession.

APPENDIX 3
SPACE-TIME MAPS OF THE SUN AND THE
PLEIADES IN THE ZENITH
T
he Mesoamerican interest in the sun, the
Pleiades, and zenith passages was ex¬
plored in Part II, where I deciphered how the
myth encoded into the Pyramid of Kukulcan
at Chichen Itza incorporates the compelling
dynamics of these primary players. The phe¬
nomenon by which the sun, the Pleiades, and
the zenith converge, what I termed the Ze¬
nith Cosmology, is complex, and is caused
by the precession of the equinoxes. Some
clarification is needed in regard to solar ze¬
nith-passage ranges, and I have devised a
chronological-geographical map to concisely
express the astronomical dynamics involved
in the Zenith Cosmology. I wove together
criteria of space (latitude) and time (eras de¬
termined by the precession of the equinoxes)
to create a comprehensive space-time map
(see Table-Map A3-1).
TABLE-MAP A3-1. CHRONOLOGICAL
GEOGRAPHICAL MOVEMENT OF THE
ZENITH COSMOLOGY
Table-Map A3-1 encapsulates the move¬
ment and parameters of the Zenith Cosmol¬
ogy. The last column (on the right) associ¬
ates a direct space-time dynamic between
specific cultural traditions and the occur¬
rence of the phenomenon in question (coin¬
cidence of solar zenith passage with sun-Ple
iades conjunction). Cultures living at the
correct latitude at the correct time (such as
at Copan) would have experienced the sun
Pleiades-zenith convergence. Thus, Copan
skywatchers were probably tracking this phe¬
nomenal convergence of two different celes¬
tial events "as it happened." For a cultural
epoch in which the time and latitude factors
do not converge very well, something else
may have been going on. For example, activ¬
ity at Chichen Itza in the ninth century a.d.
was concerned with the future synchroniza¬
tion that, for the 20°N latitude, occurs in the
twenty-first century. As explained in Part II,
Chichen's Zenith Cosmology encodes long
range precessional calculations and explains
the hidden meaning of the architecture and
orientation of the Pyramid of Kukulcan.
Table-Map A3-1 collapses a great deal of
information into a deceptively simple pre¬
sentation. The latitudes on the left of the
table can be matched with the latitudes on
the right side of the map. The astronomical
synchronization illustrated involves dates of
sun-Pleiades conjunctions (these change with
the precession of the equinoxes) and dates of
solar zenith passages (these change with lati¬
tude). This table-map serves as a guide to
answer the question: When and where do
sun-Pleiades-zenith conjunctions occur? The
complex dynamics of the Zenith Cosmology
define an ever-changing emphasis on differ¬
ent latitudes and different eras. The general
flow of the "Zero Point" of the zenith align¬
ment is from south to north, from past to
future. Latitudinal bands are indicated in
the map for ease in identifying cultural loca¬
tions.
The table in Table-Map A3-1 is divided
into five columns. The first column gives the
solar zenith-passage date for the correspond¬
ing latitude. These are ideal mid-point dates;
zenith observations (as we will see below)
345



346 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
fulfilling the criterion of "no shadows at high
noon" actually extend over several days. As
can be seen, from the latitudes of 15°N to
21°N, all of the zenith-convocation dates fall
in May. The second column gives the era in
which the Pleiades were in conjunction with
the sun on the corresponding date. Because
of precession, these eras are 72 years long,
with the dates given representing the mid¬
point of each era. The third column shows
the latitude, with the dates given correspond¬
ing to one-third divisions of each degree.
With the information in these first three col¬
umns, one can thus identify the era and lati¬
tude in which the solar zenith-passage date
corresponds to the date of the sun-Pleiades
conjunction. This means that at high noon
on the given date, in the given era, at the lati¬
tude indicated, both the sun and the Pleia¬
des, together, pass through the precise cen¬
ter of the sky. As proposed in Part II, this as¬
tronomical event was of great interest to
Mesoamerican cosmologists, who perceived
it as the apotheosis and manifestation of
Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan.The fourth column
gives the date exactly one-half year after the
date given in column 1, because I believe that
the November New Fire ceremony of the Tol
tecs and Aztecs, during which the passage of
the Pleiades through the zenith at midnight
was carefully observed, was a method for
tracking the precise date of a sun-Pleiades
conjunction six months later. Again, these
observations change with precession, where¬
as solar zenith-passage dates only change
with the latitude of observation.
THE NO-SHADOW DATE-RANGE
I have made a distinction between the
appearance of the phenomenon in question
to the inhabitants of Chichen Itza and to the
inhabitants of Copan. Copan is at the lati¬
tude of 15°N, where the sun-Pleiades passed
through the zenith together in the era a.d.
644. At that latitude, the phenomenon oc¬
curred on May 1. For Chichen Itza, which is
much farther to the north, the phenomenon
centers on May 23 (in the twenty-second cen¬
tury a.d.). However, I have made the case that
latitude-dependent zenith observations are
subject to a range of several days, making the
Chichen event relevant to May 20 in our
current era, with a negligable deviation. Why
is this? Another space-time table is called for.
Since the visible marker of the zenith
passage phenomenon involves the criterion
of "no shadows at high noon," the allowable
range of days hinges upon how much the sun
changes its declination from day to day.
"Declination" is the angular distance mea¬
sured from the celestial equator to an astro¬
nomical object at its highest arc (its passage
through the meridian). If the rate of declina¬
tion change is great, only a two- or three-day
range can be accepted. If the declination
change is slow, a range of up to fifteen days
or more can be acceptable. The rate of the
sun's change in declination from day to day
is a function of how close the dates in ques¬
tion are to the solstice. Around the solstices,
the sun's declination changes very little from
day to day. Thus, shadows cast by the sun
over a five- to ten-day period will show little
variation. On the other hand, if the solar ze¬
nith-passage date falls near the equinox, the
rate of declination change is very great. Con¬
sequently, the range of acceptable "no¬
shadow" days is limited. Dates progressing
from the March equinox toward the June sol¬
stice show a gradual slowing of the sun's rate
of declination change. In real terms, this
means that for Copan, where the sun-Pleia
des-zenith-passage days were closer to the
spring equinox, the phenomenon came and
passed more quickly than at latitudes farther
to the north.
The solar zenith-passage dates applicable

348 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
This table shows that I am justified in
using at least a six-day range for solar ze¬
nith-passage observations at the latitude of
Chichen Itza, because between May 20 and
May 25 the declination of the sun changes
less than one degree. The sun itself spans
one-half a degree in the sky, so shadow-cast¬
ing observations will certainly support a six
day range as proposed in my theory about
the Pyramid at Chichen Itza (meaning that
the "sun-Pleiades in the Zenith" event is
currently within range over Chichen Itza on
May 20).
The two zenith-passage dates for any
given latitude are bisected by the solstice
axis; thus, the rate of change for both is iden¬
tical. Notice in Table A3-2 how the rate of
change in June is very small. This means that
the day-to-day changes in the shadows cast
by vertical poles will be hardly noticeable.
Since late-May and June solar zenith-passages
are associated with latitudes farther to the
north, it might be said that the phenomenon
"lingers" in those regions. In comparison, the
early May zenith-passage dates farther to the
south (e.g., at Copan or Izapa) are much more
fleeting. We can thus say that the solar ze¬
nith-passage phenomenon had different
"qualities" at different Maya cities. Although
this is a complicated phenomenon, for us to
take the time to familiarize ourselves with
its dynamics gives us a glimpse of how so¬
phisticated Mesoamerican skywatchers must
have been. Since it is now accepted that
skywatchers throughout Mesoamerica were
making solar zenith-passage observations,
this changeable nature of the phenomenon
was probably recognized and incorporated
into their evolving cosmological concepts.
Zenith-passage events were important
facets of Mesoamerican cosmology. Archaeo
astronomers should incorporate the rate of
declination change into their examination
of solar zenith passages at different Meso¬
american sites, for the reasons outlined
above. Toward making this easier, one can
consult the tables in this appendix. Finally,
Table A3-3 shows the changing dates of sun
Pleiades conjunctions through the centuries.

APPENDIX 3. SPACE-TIME MAPS OF THE SUN ANDTHE PLEIADES / 349
the "Zero Point." Because of the space occu¬
pied by the Pleiades, the question of when
the sun is exactly in conjunction with the
Pleiades is difficult to pin down. The year
a.d. 2012 serves as an ideal era marker. Back
calculations of sun-Pleiades conjunctions
thus subtract one day per seventy-two years
(I used seventy-two-year intervals as an ap¬
proximation of one day/degree of preces
sional movement), resulting in this table of
the dates for sun-Pleiades conjunctions that
we can compare with Table-Map A3-1 and
Table A3-2.
Table A3-3 also indirectly defines the day
six months later when New Fire observations
were made. David Drucker (1986) claims
New Fire ceremonies took place at Teoti
huacan in Central Mexico in a.d. 311-312.
Interestingly, when we move forward from
this date at fifty-two-year intervals, we find
the baktun shift of a.d. 830 and the 1 Ahau
18 Kayab date of November, 934—the Sacred
Day of Venus in the Dresden Codex identi¬
fied by Floyd Lounsbury (1983). Another
Maya researcher, Robert L. Hall (1989-1993a),
stated that the sun conjuncted the Pleiades
on April 27 (G), 411, which demonstrates the
accuracy of this table.
Heliacal rises and sets of the Pleiades are
still of interest to the Chorti Maya. Ethnolo¬
gist Raphael Girard (1966:198) reported that
the Chorti Maya (who live near the ancient
site of Copan) carefully observe the Pleiades
on the dates of solar zenith passage. This is
very intriguing, and we know by consulting
Table-Map A3-1 above that the sun and the
Pleiades moved through the zenith together
on May 1 during Copan's heyday (in roughly
a.d. 644). Since then, the sun-Pleiades con¬
junction date has moved forward nineteen
days (because of precession). This means that
today, on the May 1 solar zenith passage at
the latitude of the Chorti, the Pleiades are
rough-ly 19° east of the sun, and are making
their last appearance as evening stars.
Anthony Aveni (in Closs et al. 1984) sum¬
marizes essential information about the
northern extremes of Venus and a possible
observation window in Structure 22 at
Copan. Around the time of the building of
Temple 22, in the year prior to a great Venus
extreme, the day of Venus's first visibility fell
within an eight-day period ranging from April
25 to May 3. Significantly, the a.d. 650 con¬
struction date for Temple 22 falls within
range of the great alignment of the sun
Pleiades with the zenith at Copan. Since the
heliacal rise of Venus occurs only four days
after its inferior conjunction with the sun,
this coincidence of astronomical phenomena
suggests the seventh-century skywatchers
of Copan intentionally tracked Venus-sun
Pleiades conjunctions in the zenith. An ex¬
ploration of the iconography of Structure 22
with this in mind might yield interesting
insights.
At the very least, the space-time maps
provided in this appendix demonstrate the
complexity of one astronomical phenomenon
that occupied Mesoamerican skywatchers, a
phenomenon that was encoded into the Ze¬
nith Cosmology. Rate of declination change,
latitude-specific date-ranges of zenith pas¬
sages, the movements of the Pleiades, Venus,
and the zenith sun—these are the celestial
dynamics that New World astronomers ex¬
plored and that revealed to them the subtle
and complex rhythms of heaven and Earth.






APPENDIX 4:
EVIDENCE FOR A BLACK HOLE IN MAYA
CREATION TEXTS
T
he corpus of Maya hieroglyphic mate¬
rial contains information about the
names of places. Some of these are actual
Maya cities, whereas others are more enig¬
matic and are typically ascribed to "mytho¬
logical" locations. Some of these mytholog¬
ical locations are where Creation events hap¬
pened, and, knowing that myth describes as¬
tronomy, we can expect that these Creation
narratives probably refer to specific celestial
locations. In this appendix I will review aca¬
demic material on Maya placenames that
refer to mythological Creation events and
will decode the astronomy. The academic
material supports my thesis that the Maya
believed Creation to occur in the Galactic
Center (near the crossroads in Sagittarius),
in the Black Hole that resides there, because
Maya Creation narratives explicitly point to
a celestial crossroads and a "black hole" that
gives birth to deities. How are we to explain
this parallel? Scholars are prone to dismiss
this kind of association as a coincidence, but
the fact is that it may point to the real knowl¬
edge that Maya cosmologists, through intu¬
ition and shamanistic technologies, gathered
and formulated into their astounding cos¬
mology. Maya epigraphers David Stuart and
Stephen Houston published a monograph on
Maya placenames that included a chapter on
mythological locations. Although no effort
was made to associate these mythological
locations with their corresponding astro¬
nomical locations, I will use this association
as a key to identifying the actual astronomi¬
cal location of Maya Creation and the astro¬
nomical features the Maya believed to be
involved in cosmogenesis.
One of the mythological "sites" identi¬
fied by Stuart and Houston was deciphered
as meaning "black hole." When I read this, I
immediately thought of the dark-rift in the
Milky Way near the ecliptic in Sagittarius,
as well as the Black Hole that astrophysicists
now believe resides within the center of our
Galaxy. My work with the Maya Long Count
end-date and Maya Popol Vuh/Hero Twin
Creation myth strongly suggests that the
dark-rift was the Maya Creation Place, the
cosmic birth canal of the Milky Way Great
Mother.
The dark-rift can be thought of as a black
hole in the sky and may be the visible pointer
to deeper cosmological mysteries lurking
nearby. Astrophysicists now recognize that
a Black Hole, a hyper-dense object from
which even light cannot escape, exists within
the center of most galaxies, including ours.
Black Holes are mysterious "singularities"
in which space and time break down. In the
academic and popular literature, they have
been envisioned (and mathematically mod¬
eled) as transdimensional portals to other
universes. The Black Hole in the center of
our Galaxy is literally located where every¬
thing in our Galaxy, including us, originated.
It represents a great mystery, resonating with
the mysteries of being at the heart of the
human soul. The deepest inner mystery of
human origins corresponds with the deepest
stellar mysteries, both traceable to the cen¬
ter and source of our world, the Black Hole
in the Galactic Center. As I will outline be
351



352 / MAYA CO SMOG E N E S I S 2012
low, there is clear evidence within Maya Cre¬
ation narratives that the Maya were aware
of the Black Hole in the Galactic Center and
considered it to be intimately involved in
cosmogenesis.
In Stuart and Houston's chapter on
mythological placenames, a frequently oc¬
curring mythic placename in the Classic
period inscriptions is linked with events at
the beginning of the current era, 4 Ahau 8
Cumku, 13.0.0.0.0 (1994:69). The glyphic
passage consists of the elements glyph-T
128, "sky," Yax (first or green), and the NAL
superfix. "In all cases, the text refers to the
place of events that happened at 13.0.0.0.0"
(71). Here I will point out that the Long
Count date 13.0.0.0.0 refers, literally, to the
end of the current era in a.d. 2012, rather
than to the beginning. It does appear that
Long Count, tzolkin, and haab dates on
monuments such as Stela C from Quirigua
are, in fact, referring to the "beginning" date
of the current era, but it just may be that
the Maya were looking at the astronomical
event to happen on the end-date to describe
what had happened on the "beginning" date.
This is in accordance with the nature of cy¬
clic time and the cyclic return implicit in
the 13-baktun cycle. We might say that, con¬
ceptually, the beginning is the end. In fact,
it is rather strange that the Maya recorded
the "beginning" with a value of thirteen in
the baktun register. Considering that the
Maya recognized place values greater than
the baktun, there might be something else
going on here. In fact, one must make a leap
to assume that the Maya just willy-nilly re¬
corded the "beginning" of the current era as
13.0.0.0.0 (rather than 0.0.0.0.0). It may be
just as much of a leap (in the other direc¬
tion) to entertain that Maya Creation monu¬
ments actually describe astronomy to occur
on the end-date. However, within modern
Maya thinking, birth is thought to occur at
the end of a process, rather than at the be¬
ginning.
Importantly, prevalent "north" and "sky"
glyphs point to the sky as the location of
mythological Creation events. As many
Maya scholars now concur, "north" can
mean either "up" or "zenith" in Maya cos¬
mography. Another prevalent place-glyph
associated with the Creation setting was
translated to mean "black hole" and is asso¬
ciated with the Mesoamerican ballgame and
its ballcourts (71). In the Popol Vuh, there is
a strong connection between ballcourts and
the Underworld (D. Tedlock 1985:46).
Hunahpu's severed head is used as a ball in a
game between the Hero Twins and the Un¬
derworld deities. Linnea Wren (1995) showed
how on the night of the June solstice in era
a.d. 865, the Milky Way, with its dark-rift
looming overhead, aligned with the Chichen
Itza ballcourt. Thus, the black hole glyphic
designation and its affinity with ballcourts
and "entrance to the Underworld" contexts
strongly associates it with the dark-rift in the
Milky Way. The dark-rift is called the xibalba
be or "Black Road" by the Maya (D. Tedlock
1985:358).
Continuing with our examination of
Stuart and Houston's monograph, the "black
hole" compound "when coupled with the
Ahau title... can also appear as a name glyph
of Classic Period Lords" (71). And one ex¬
ample from Lacanha appears after an ut-i (it
happened) expression "in inexplicable asso¬
ciation with a 'birth' event that we presume
to be mythological in character" (71-72).
So we have an association between the
Ahau title of rulership (originally meaning
"sun"), the dark-rift/Black Hole, and a birth
event. The dark-rift is the place where One
Hunahpu's head is hung (D. Tedlock 1985:39,
334); in other words, the crook in the tree is
a metaphor for the rift in the Milky Way tree.
From there, One Hunahpu's skull spits to



APPENDIX 4. EVIDENCE FOR A BLACK HOLE IN MAYA CREATION TEXTS / 353
impregnate Blood Moon with the Hero
Twins. Thus, the rift is a place of concep¬
tion, the celestial place of Creation and birth,
if you will. Other Mesoamerican depictions,
such as the inverted Goddess from the
Tamoanchan emergence scene in the Codex
Fejervary-Mayer, clearly imply that the dark
rift also was envisioned as the birth canal of
the Great Mother, the Milky Way. A similar
scene is found in the Selden Codex.
Next, the black hole compound is occa¬
sionally coupled with a glyph designating a
watery environment. Water belongs to the
feminine principle. Here we may have a ref¬
erence to the Milky Way's other identity as
a river, and Mesoamericans believed water
to be a great rejuvenator, a nectar of life.
Steam baths and community houses were
sacred domains where purification rites took
place. The black hole compound is associ¬
ated with Copan Structure 22A, considered
to be a popol nah, or community house,
where vision ceremonies took place. The
beautiful, carved imagery on Structure 22
depicts the Milky Way, the ecliptic, and the
portal to the Underworld (the dark-rift).
Another mythological placename is ma
ta-wi-la or matawil. Matawil, like Black
Hole, can refer to either a title (as in rulership)
or a location: "Similar shifts between title
and toponym mark the use of the "black
hole" compound" (75). The idea of a throne
comes to mind, in which a celestial location
is reserved for people of special position. The
Milky Way/Mother Goddess would probably
be a good homebase for Ahau rulers, and the
crossing point of Milky Way and ecliptic
the Creation Place—would certainly be a
good throne for a ruler. This cross also is now
known to be the center of the Maya Sacred
Tree, such as we see on Pacal's sarcophagus
lid. In Maya Creation myth, the Maize God
(who is none other than One Hunahpu/First
Father) sets up his house of rulership by
"stretching the cord" and marking the sides
and corners of his domain, an act centered
upon the cosmic crossroads (D. Tedlock
1985:334), which, again, is the crossing point
of Milky Way and ecliptic (with the dark-rift
nearby). The dark-rift in the Milky Way, be¬
ing known as the xibalba be or the Road to
the Underworld, is identical to the primor¬
dial cave of creation out of which came the
first humans. It also is the place or cave of
creation because it is the birth canal of the
Milky Way Goddess-Mother. I also argue that
One Hunahpu (First Father) is reborn from
the dark-rift, because the December solstice
sun (First Father) conjoins the dark-rift on
13.0.0.0.0. (In other words, Ahau rulers, in
emulation of the mythological-astronomical
Creation scenario, claim for their symbolic
throne the Black Hole birth canal in the sky.
This may be why there is an association be¬
tween title and location attributed to
matawil and the black hole in Stuart and
Houston's analysis.)
A depiction in Stuart and Houston's
monograph (76) from La Pasadita shows two
men operating a fire drill. The lower portion
shows a gaping skeletal mouth enclosing a
box of glyphs, including the matawil com¬
pound. Matawil is associated with dead an¬
cestors, and the gaping skeletal mouth (be¬
ing a common mode for representing the
Underworld) reiterates this Xibalban context
(77).
Although it was not mentioned in Stuart
and Houston's monograph, the black hole
glyph depicted and discussed (75) looks like
a miniature abbreviation of the gaping skel¬
etal mouth in the carving mentioned above.
The skeletal mouth serves the same symbolic
purpose as other mouths,- it is a passageway
to the Underworld, the xibalba be or dark
rift.
According to Stuart and Houston, when
placenames (mythological or otherwise) are

attached to a verb, this indicates the loca¬
tion of an event (77). The matawil compound
behaves like this, and in several texts de¬
scribing the birth of certain deities, the
matawil compound follows a birth event.
Most likely then, "Matawil is where the
deities are born" (77). In Maya thought, life
comes from death: One is dead before being
born. One comes into the Earth plane from
Xibalba. One is born through the birth ca¬
nal portal (the dark-rift/Black Hole) into this
realm. Considering matawil's association
with the dead ancestors of the Underworld,
the way to get from the Underworld to be¬
ing born on Earth is through the birthplace,
through the road which leads to/from the
Underworld.
"But where is this Matawil?" (77). Stuart
and Houston's query is now answerable with
a fair amount of certainty, but they veered
down another path in looking for the answer.
They even provided a set-up for the correct
answer: There are hints "that Matawil cor¬
responded to an area both enclosed and de¬
fined by skeletal jaws ..." (77). At this junc¬
ture, they seem to miss some pretty obvious
connections. For clarity, I will summarize the
symbolic connections I have outlined so far:
skeletans refer to the dead, and jaws or
mouths refer (as in the archaic symbol of the
jaguar’s mouth) to the entrance to the Un¬
derworld. The Road to the Underworld is
called xibalba be, whose astronomical coun¬
terpart is the dark-rift in the Milky Way.
Perhaps Stuart and Houston were not on the
wrong track in their explanation of Matawil's
location, but were just being obscure. They
do mention the early mythic history of
Palenque and migration legends (which I
should add are tied to Creation and emer¬
gence legends). A phrase they use reveals a
conceptual assumption that, again, makes
me think they err: "... in terms of move¬
ments over a landscape fusing real and mytho¬
logical imagery" (77). The counterpointing
of "real" and "mythological" suggests that
mythological places are being thought of as
purely imaginary, without any place in the
real world. However, Maya mythology has
been shown to be very concrete—it is ob¬
served in the sky—and this has been my guid¬
ing interpretive basis all along. That Stuart
and Houston missed this interpretive key is
clear in the final words of their discussion
on mythological placenames—which I will
get to momentarily.
In their chapter summation, Stuart and
Houston say something profound: "... just
as the deities acceded to high office or gave
birth, so too did they live in specific places,
ranging from the 'fifth sky' to the 'black
hole'" (80). But then they feel the need to
keep humans separate from deities, stating
that "... the overlap between human and
mythological geography would appear to be
small. . ." (80). Their conclusion continues
by thus saying that human beings did not
perform rituals in the places where super¬
naturals were, nor did deities dwell among
people. This belief has some truth, but when
coupled with the previous quote in which
their misconception of mythological geogra¬
phy as "not real" is stated, I think they are
invoking a dualist framework where it is not
appropriate. Terrestrial geography provided
a parallel map to celestial geography, and as¬
tronomical events are the landscape of so
called mythological places and events. Sky
and Earth are the duality here, but the Quiche
Maya concept "skyearth" suggests that the
Maya do not perceive these as separate
realms, and probably never did. Therefore, I
cannot accept that these two geographies
mythological and terrestrial—were "kept rig¬
idly apart" (80). In that the entrance to the
Underworld could be found in a nearby cave,
in the body of a woman, as well as in the
dark-rift in the sky, celestial and terrestrial



APPENDIX 4. EVIDENCE FOR A BLACK HOLE IN MAYA CREATION TEXTS / 355
geographies were clearly interwoven. Said an¬
other way, dead ancestors and other deities
were immediately present; much of Maya
ritual was concerned with feeding these ever¬
present beings.
If my own work is on the mark (Jenkins
1994d, 1995a and 1995b), the birth canal of
the Great Mother is an extremely important
"mythological" location that has, as is the
convention, an astronomical counterpart.
Stuart and Houston's identification of the
mythological placename called "black hole,"
with attendant contexts relating to ball
courts, mythological "birth" events, Ahau
rulership, Underworld doorways, and the be¬
ginning date of the current era (with likely
reference to the astronomical events that ac¬
tually occur on the end-date), strongly sug¬
gests that the Black Hole concept refers to
the dark-rift in the Milky Way in Sagittarius.
Furthermore, by extension, it may in fact re¬
fer to the Black Hole within the Galactic
Center, which would seem to be the more
likely astronomical feature responsible for
these profound Creation mysteries of the
Maya.






APPENDIX 5
RESPONSE TO COUNTERARGUMENTS
T
his appendix grew out of a need to re¬
spond to "Comments on the Creation
Date/' posted on the Mesoamerican Archae¬
ology website by Linda Scheie in April 1996.
The so-called "end-date" of the 13-baktun
cycle of the Maya Long Count in a.d. 2012
has been the subject of internet discussions,
and in early 1996 Linda Scheie responded to
a question regarding the Long Count. She ad¬
dressed the importance the Maya applied to
the date in a.d. 2012, and reiterated her view¬
point as found in A Forest of Kings: "The
Maya, however, did not conceive this to be
the end of creation, as many have suggested"
(82). This basically sums up her position on
the meaning of the 13-baktun cycle end-date
in 2012. The statement is essentially correct,
because the Maya believed that time is cy¬
clic, but continuing ambiguities demand that
we clarify our terms and ask more pointed
questions regarding this date. I have always
made an effort to refer to this date more spe¬
cifically as "the end-date of the 13-baktun
cycle of the Maya Long Count calendar," and
I do not concur with the Neo-Atlantean pole
shift cataclysmologists that the world will
literally end in 2012. With this distinction
in mind, I admit that I still occasionally
write, as a shorthand note, "end-date" or
"end-date in 2012." This does not mean that
I believe the Maya calendar or the world will
end in a.d. 2012. However, as I will show, it
is clear that the 2012 date was singularly
important for the people who created the
Long Count calendar.
In comparison, the sense of Scheie's po¬
sition, as it has filtered out to become a kind
of conventional wisdom, is that the date in
a. d. 2012, though an important baktun shift,
is just another somewhat ambiguous cycle
ending, and is ultimately less important than
a proposed 20-baktun cycle. Scheie writes,
"Pacal, the great king of Palenque, predicted
in his inscriptions that the 80th Calendar
Round anniversary of his accession will be
celebrated eight days after the first 8000-year
cycle [20 baktuns actually equal 7,885 years]
in which the Mayan Calendar ends . . . a.d.
October 15th, 4772" (1990:82).
Scheie uses this as her primary argument
that "the Maya did not conceive this [the 13
baktun cycle end-date in a.d. 2012] to be the
end of creation." I submit that a 20-baktun
cycle had little importance for those who
created the Long Count, and that the 13
baktun cycle end-date in a.d. 2012 was, in
fact, considered to be the end of a World Age,
a large cycle of time. The important ques¬
tion to ask is: What were the intentions of
the creators of Long Count? The latter-day
political machinations of one Maya ruler
(Pacal) are less important; neither Pacal nor
his era developed the Long Count calendar.
The first Long Count date appears in the ar¬
chaeological record in the first century b.c.
Edmonson (1988) and Hall (1989-1993a) have
even argued that the inauguration of the Long
Count actually goes much further back, to
the fourth century b.c. or the sixth century
b. c. The intended meaning of the Long Count
and its subsequent baktun-endings must de¬
rive from those who placed it in real-time,
not to a king who appeared on the scene some
seven hundred years after the fact.
But what about Pacal's era? Was a cycle
of thirteen baktuns recognized by Pacal's con
357



358 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
temporaries? Yes, and there are three ex¬
amples from three different Maya kingdoms:
Coba, Quirigua, and Palenque. Dated inscrip¬
tions at these sites, erected during the Clas¬
sic period, call the end of the previous era (in
3114b.c.) 13.0.0.0.0, 4 Ahau 8 Cumku. These
are the so-called "Creation monuments," and
they reveal a lot about exactly when the
Maya calendar clicks back to zero (i.e., at
what interval the great World Age cycle re¬
peats). The Creation monuments demon¬
strate that thirteen is the final baktun place
value to be used when counting ages of Cre¬
ation. The previous era ended after the
completion of thirteen baktuns, after which
the baktun place value reset. If that was not
the case, then, for example, the Hauberg
Stela, which contains the Long Count date
8.8.0.4.0, would really be dated 21.8.0.4.0.
Since all Long Count dates ever found were
recorded with the assumption that 13.0.0.0.0,
4 Ahau 8 Cumku (August 11, 3114 b.c. ac¬
cording to the 584283 correlation), equals
zero, the early Maya clearly understood a
cycle of thirteen baktuns to be the signifi¬
cant Creation cycle. We may presume that
the current cycle was intended to follow the
same pattern; after all, why should one Cre¬
ation cycle be thirteen baktuns long and the
next be twenty baktuns long? Pacal's 20
baktun period is an exception; it does not
speak for how his contemporaries understood
when the Creation cycle begins anew, nor
does it reflect what the Long Count's inven¬
tors apparently had in mind (which we will
get to shortly). A 13-baktun Creation cycle
was clearly the consensus belief.
The questions that the end-date debate
distract us from examining involve the as¬
tronomical nature of the 2012 end-date. The
people who put the Long Count system in
place, some seven hundred years prior to the
birth of Pacal, were apparently targeting the
date in a.d. 2012 as one they thought would
be an appropriate "end" of a great time-cycle
of Creation. On what grounds do I say this?
Three reasons: thirteen baktuns = 260
katuns, 13.0.0.0.0 = an accurate winter sol¬
stice, and the astronomical alignment in a.d.
2012.
I will treat these points one by one. The
first reason is a suggested rationale for thir¬
teen baktuns being a valid period. As Hall
(1989-1993a) proposed, katun periods were
probably recognized prior to the full-scale
development of the Long Count. Thirteen
baktuns equal 260 katuns, and this mirrors
(in the typical holistic cosmovision of the
Maya) the 260 days of the tzolkin calendar.
Scheie (1996) suggests that twenty bak¬
tuns is preferable to thirteen baktuns because
it is in accordance with the vigesimal count¬
ing system used in Mesoamerican mathemat¬
ics. The end-date of the 20-baktun cycle cer¬
tainly has value as a benchmark in time, but
there are exceptions to the strict use of mul¬
tiples of twenty. As we know, the uinal pe¬
riod (of twenty days) is multiplied by eigh¬
teen (rather than twenty) to give us the 360
day tun. In addition, thirteen was just as
important a number as twenty, so there is
no reason to argue against a 13-baktun cycle.
At any rate, I do not believe that the length
of the so-called Great Cycle is as important
to look at as is the date in 2012. There are
unique astronomical qualities to this date
that, for whatever reason, have not been ac¬
knowledged by most Maya scholars, which
brings me to point two.
According to the 584283 correlation, the
13.0.0.0.0 end-date falls on December 21, the
winter solstice. I will anticipate and address
a common argument against this date and
then return to my point. Following the work
of Floyd Lounsbury (1983), Linda Scheie and
David Freidel report the end-date of the 13
baktun cycle in a.d. 2012 as December 23
(Scheie and Freidel 1990; Freidel et al. 1993).



APPENDIX 5. RESPONSE TO COUNTERARGUMENTS / 359
(By the way, many other people, including
scholars such as Coe (1992) and popular writ¬
ers such as Hancock (1995), have followed
Scheie's and Freidel's lead.) In my correspon¬
dence with professional academicians, some
have argued, rather absurdly, that this is not
"close enough" to be considered a Decem¬
ber solstice, thus disqualifying my point. I
offer the following clarification as a much
needed and little acknowledged correction on
a fine point of the correlation question. Er¬
roneous "conventional wisdom" can delay
advances in any field of study for decades,
until someone eventually comes along to
point out the obvious. I explored this prob¬
lem in detail in my study of the Maya Venus
Calendar (1994a:23-82). A rundown follows
as briefly as possible, and then we will con¬
tinue with point three.
Lounsbury (1983) argued for resurrecting
the old 584285 correlation value (Thompson
1930) by way of his brilliant identification
of a heliacal rise of Venus in the Dresden Co¬
dex. The date recorded in the Dresden was 1
Ahau 18 Kayab, which was November 18,
934 a.d. (Julian Calendar) according to the
584283 correlation, and November 20, 934
a.d. (J) according to the old 584285 correla¬
tion. Venus actually rose as morning star pre¬
cisely on the latter date, supposedly "con¬
firming" the old 584285 value. Using a "zero
deviation" criterion, Lounsbury based his ar¬
gument for the 584285 on this event. How¬
ever, the requirement of "zero deviation" is
erroneous,- the synodical cycle of Venus in
fact varies between 580 and 588 days from
cycle to cycle. As Dennis Tedlock reported
(1985:238), Lounsbury's astronomical argu¬
ment for the 584285 value could, according
to astronomer John B. Carlson, "easily be two
days off." Bricker (1988) wrote that Louns¬
bury's theory is based on "a misinterpreta¬
tion of the astronomical data" (82). And there
is another reason why Lounsbury's position
points us to December 21, which I will ad¬
dress shortly.
Lounsbury's follow-up (1992) on the same
argument uses a curious bit of circular logic
to support his theory, but is not at all con¬
vincing when examined closely. This close
examination was something that few did, and
I direct the interested reader to my essays
posted on my Four Ahau Press website for a
complete and detailed analysis. Unfortu¬
nately, Lounsbury's position, though errone¬
ous, was passed along to his students, caus¬
ing confusion on this point of a two-day
discrepency on the "end" date.
The major challenge to Lounsbury's hy¬
pothesis (1983) that quickly emerged (D.
Tedlock 1985:238) is the fact that the sur¬
viving day-counts followed by many differ¬
ent Maya groups in Guatemala all confirm
the 584283 correlation (LaFarge 1947; Lin¬
coln 1942; Oakes 1951; Sexton 1981; B. Ted¬
lock 1982). Lounsbury explained this by pro¬
posing that there must have been a two-day
shift in the day-count sometime between the
time the Dresden Venus information was re¬
corded and the Conquest. This would have
had to have been a two-day shift orchestrated
simultaneously throughout Mesoamerica, a
scenario almost impossible to imagine. How¬
ever, if we accept all of the explanations of¬
fered, including the two-day shift that in ef¬
fect brings the 584285 into line with the
584283 correlation after the Conquest, then
we still arrive at December 21, 2012 a.d. as
the 13.0.0.0.0 date. So, even if we support
Lounsbury's theory, we cannot use an "un¬
shifted" 584285 correlation number to cal¬
culate any post-Conquest dates, including
the end-date in a.d. 2012. The bottom line
then, is that whether one follows the widely
accepted 584283 correlation or Lounsbury's
theory, the end of the 13-baktun cycle of the
Maya Long Count calendar occurs on Decem¬
ber 21, an accurate December solstice.



360 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
On February 19, 1994,1 met my Quiche
daykeeper friend Diego in Antigua, Guate¬
mala. With great humor at the impending
serendipity of it, we both pulled out our
Cholb’al Q’ij (1994) calendar books and
pointed out to each other that the day of our
first meeting was 1 Hunajpu (1 Ahau, the
ancient Sacred Day of Venus). This is in ac¬
cordance with the 584283 correlation, which,
of course, is supported by the numerous eth¬
nographic studies cited above.
In the True Count still being used by the
highland Maya, February 19, 1994 equals 1
Ahau, and projecting forward from this date
to December 21, 2012 a.d. yields, appropri¬
ately enough, 4 Ahau, the traditional tzolkin
date on the 13-baktun cycle end-date. Al¬
though this whole clarification may seem
petty or minor, it should be made because
without it doubt may remain in the minds
of those requiring absolute accuracy regard¬
ing the truth of calling the 13.0.0.0.0 end
date a December solstice.
So, having addressed the sources of con¬
flict on this point, we can now, without sus¬
picion, ask some appropriate questions
about the end-date in a.d. 2012. First of all,
the very fact that it is an accurate Decem¬
ber solstice is quite striking. This means
that the people who created the Long Count
system of timekeeping and defined its place¬
ment in real time were able to calculate an
accurate December solstice some 2,000
years into the future. It also suggests that
the fixing of the 13-baktun cycle in "real"
time was determined by its end-date. Why
did the ancient Maya choose to highlight a
December solstice, and how did they do it?
To answer the last part of this question first,
according to Edmonson (1988) this was ac¬
complished with the "year-drift formula,"
in which 1,507 solar years (of 365.2422 days
each) equals 1,508 haab (of 365 days each).
This in itself reveals a level of scientific so¬
phistication not commonly granted to cul¬
tures of this era (circa 200 b.c.). As to "why,"
it could be argued that a December solstice
is an appropriate "end" or "beginning"
marker because it basically has that mean¬
ing within the annual cycle of the seasons.
This is certainly true, and can remain an
adequate explanation until we ask the next
question: "Why 2012?" By now we have
learned to avoid answering these questions
with such trite inconsequentials as "no par¬
ticular reason" or "just a coincidence" and
accept that Maya cosmology has much more
intentionality lurking within it than previ¬
ously thought. The 2012 date is not an arbi¬
trary calculational artifact derived from fix¬
ing the "beginning" date back in 3114 b.c.
Because the end-date is a December solstice,
and for other reasons I will address shortly,
it appears to have been the primary and in¬
tended "anchor" of the 13-baktun cycle. If
anything, it is the "beginning" date in 3114
b.c. that we should consider an ambiguous
back-calculation.
To state this simply, the 13-baktun cycle
was fixed in real time for an astronomical
reason (the December solstice), and the end
date was the anchor. As such, we might be
willing to generate more questions by assum¬
ing that a.d. 2012, as well, was an intentional
choice. This brings me to my third point, not
really a surprise after all we have been dis¬
cussing: the astronomy in a.d. 2012. As ar¬
gued throughout this book, on 13.0.0.0.0 the
December solstice sun will be in conjunc¬
tion with the Milky Way. We can call this an
alignment between the galactic plane and the
solstice meridian. This is an event that has
slowly converged over a period of thousands
of years and is caused by the precession of
the equinoxes. As such, December 21, 2012
a.d. identifies a rare alignment in the cycle
of precession, using the Milky Way and the
dark-rift "Road to the Underworld" as the



APPENDIX 5. RESPONSE TO COUNTERARGUMENTS / 361
markers. This alignment is perfectly evoca¬
tive of the culmination (the "end") of a Great
Cycle of creation. We really have two facts
that occur at the same time, the 13-baktun
cycle end-date and a rare alignment in the
cycle of the precession of the equinoxes.
If we do not allow these ancient sky
watchers to have been sophisticated enough
to notice precession, we relegate the align¬
ment of a.d. 2012 to the unexamined bin of
"coincidence." To conclude that this is co¬
incidence pushes our thoughts beyond cred¬
ible bounds of reason. The alternative, as re¬
sistant as many will be, is that the creators
of the Long Count calendar calculated the
rate of precession over 2,000 years ago. Few
Maya scholars are as qualified to comment
on this point as archaeoastronomer Anthony
Aveni, who wrote, "Ancient astronomers
easily could detect the long-term preces
sional motion.... Through myth and legend
the earliest skywatchers transmitted their
consciousness of the passage of the vernal
equinox along the zodiac from constellation
to constellation" (1980:103). In the interest
of clarity, I will mention that it would be
more accurate to say that the alignment oc¬
curs in the era of a.d. 2012; because preces¬
sion is such a slow phenomenon, fifty years
on either side of 2012 might be appropriate.
Of course, this wider timespan strengthens
the position of the coincidentalists.
In summary, it is true that December 21,
2012 does not represent "the end of the Maya
calendar." Such generic phraseology rarely
results in clarity. Though I continue to occa¬
sionally use "end-date" as a casual conven¬
tion, the more accurate identification, one
that is perfectly true, is "the end-date of the
13-baktun cycle of the Maya Long Count."
Scheie's argument that a 20-baktun cycle had
precedence over the 13-baktun cycle is not
well-founded, as it confuses what one sev¬
enth-century Maya ruler said about the na¬
ture of the Long Count with what the origi¬
nal creators of it intended. A repeating 13
baktun cycle is implied wherever Creation
monuments have been found—for example,
at Coba and Quirigua. Rather than looking
at Classic-period examples to define the na¬
ture of the Long Count, we need to look care¬
fully at who created the Long Count system,
and where and when it arose. This consider¬
ation sends us back to the little understood
Middle Pre-Classic period of the Izapan civi¬
lization.

APPENDIX 6
RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS IN DECODING
ANCIENT COSMOLOGIES
I
n doing my research into the Maya cal¬
endar's Galactic Alignment in a.d. 2012,1
became convinced that precession was cen¬
tral to understanding the meaning of the end
date and Maya cosmology. Every time a book
came out on the Maya, such as The Mayan
Prophecies, I thought that other researchers
might have independently explored the same
thing. However, upon reading the new lit¬
erature, I found that the fact that the Decem¬
ber solstice of 2012 pinpoints a rare align¬
ment in precession was not discussed or even
mentioned as the reason why the Maya chose
2012. In addition, popular books on the mil¬
lennium, often mentioning the 2012 end-date
of the Maya, fail to recognize the solstice
Galaxy alignment. Despite this dearth of rec¬
ognition, I have grown to understand that the
Galactic Alignment is the underlying reason
for the unprecedented transformation cur¬
rently sweeping the globe, and therefore the
Maya win the best prize for prophecy.
Recently, independent researchers have
been reconstructing the esoteric secrets of
Egyptian cosmology. A key to understand¬
ing this new perspective is the idea that the
ancient Egyptians were well aware of the pre¬
cession of the equinoxes. French researcher
Schwaller de Lubicz ([1961] 1982) suggested
this decades ago and Hamlet’s Mill (1969)
explored precessional myths world wide. Jane
B. Sellers (1992) decoded precessional evi¬
dence in the ancient Egyptian texts. New
ideas about the Great Pyramid emerged with
Robert Bauval and Adrian Gilbert's amazing
The Orion Mystery. Bauval had noticed that
the three Giza pyramids mirrored, in rela¬
tive size and spacing, the three stars of
Orion's belt overhead. Moreover, the so
called air shafts of the main pyramid were
understood to actually be sight tubes, de¬
signed to view Sirius and the stars in Orion
during specific eras of precession. As a re¬
sult of using the key of precession to unlock
Egyptian astronomy, Bauval realized that the
precession-caused movements of Orion were
of central importance to the ancient Egyp¬
tian astronomer-priests. They proposed that
a time over 12,500 years ago was the Zep Tepi
or "First Time" of Egyptian myth and calen¬
dar. This was when Orion made its lowest
passage through its meridian. (The altitude
of Orion oscillates higher and lower with
precession.)
After success with The Orion Mystery,
Robert Bauval collaborated with Graham
Hancock to write The Message of the Sphinx.
Both authors relate their frustrations in deal¬
ing with closed-minded and intolerant
Egyptologists who ignore new findings com¬
ing from independent quarters and delay the
advance of knowledge. In the book, addi¬
tional findings were discussed, along with
Hancock's emphasis that the Sphinx faced
the vernal equinox sunrise in Leo during the
First Time of 10,500 b.c., and this precession
caused alignment may have motivated its
construction.
In addition to discussing the First Time
of Egyptian cosmology—roughly 10,500
b.c.—Bauval and Hancock also discuss a pro¬
jected "Last Time" in a.d. 2450, which is
one-half a precessional cycle later (1996:
283). Although the authors do not discuss
363



364 / M AY A COSMOGENESIS 2012
the Maya end-date alignment of solstice and
Galaxy, the Egyptian dates roughly bracket
the two eras in which the solstice meridian
aligns with the Galactic equator. Bauval and
Hancock also provide astronomical charts
showing the First Time of 10,500 b.c. and
the Last Time of a.d. 2450 (1996:283). Both
diagrams show the Milky Way where it runs
by Orion, and the Last Time diagram shows
the June solstice sun barely touching the
west edge of the Milky Way. This is about
as close as these authors come to recogniz¬
ing the 2012 alignment. Apparently, a sol
stice-Milky Way synchronization was not a
part of Egyptian cosmology. But if we were
to subtract 438 years (6° of precessional mo¬
tion) from the Last Time date and look at
the opposite solstice, we would see the De¬
cember solstice sun in the dark-rift near the
Galactic Center.
Bauval and Hancock may be right in their
reconstruction of the First and Last eras of
Egyptian cosmology, in that they involve the
highest and lowest meridian transits of Orion
that are intimately related to precessional
movement. However, it seems strangely co¬
incidental to me that these two eras also de¬
fine (roughly, for the Egyptian argument) the
eras in which the Maya solstice-Galaxy align¬
ment occurs. I am surprised that this was not
the central doctrine that they found. Instead,
the Maya were apparently the Ancients who
were clued into the conjunction of the De¬
cember solstice sun with the Milky Way and
Galactic Center as a precession-defined era
of transformation for humanity. Although
the extreme meridian transits of Orion were
most certainly interesting to ancient astrono¬
mers, the 2012 solstice-Galaxy alignment is
a more compelling Zero Time of the preces¬
sional growth cycle. Why? Because of the role
played by the Galactic Center in the astro¬
nomical alignment of 2012. Since this spe¬
cific idea is not found in the Egyptian mate¬
rial, yet is the highest expression of Maya
cosmological science and universal preces¬
sion wisdom, an Egyptian source of Maya
knowledge, as some researchers believe, is
not likely. In other words, the Maya were on
to something the Egyptians missed. The
Maya tapped into an understanding of the
cosmos that is beyond what the Egyptians
accomplished, and they did it independently.
Turning now to Mesoamerican cosmol¬
ogy, Graham Hancock's book Fingerprints of
the Gods embarked on a global survey of
ancient mythlore and astronomy and con¬
tains a lengthy section on Maya and Aztec
calendrics, astronomy, and cosmology. How¬
ever, Hancock's opinion of Maya culture and
its accomplishments is not very well in¬
formed and his conclusions are unfair.
Hancock reports the end-date as Decem¬
ber 23, 2012 a.d., sourced from Michael Coe's
book Breaking the Maya Code (1992:275).
Coe's information is based upon the errone¬
ous arguments of Lounsbury (1983), repeated
by his student Linda Scheie (Scheie and
Freidel 1990). As I discussed in Appendix 5,
this end-date is based upon an academic mis¬
conception. But most unfortunate is Han¬
cock's emphasis that Maya calendar science
was probably imported from elsewhere. He
interprets Mesoamerican knowledge through
Old World filters, and much gets lost in the
process. He denigrates independent Maya
genius by arguing that "the 'semi-civilized'
Maya" (1995:161) would have no use for
something as complex and sophisticated as
the Long Count calendar (let alone might
they have invented it). According to Han¬
cock, apart from their use of zero and place
numeration, the Maya were an "unremark¬
able Central American tribe" (1995:160). Af¬
ter summarizing information about the huge
Long Count numbers recorded at Quirigua,
extending, theoretically, to millions of years,
he writes: "Isn't this all a bit avante-garde



APPENDIX 6. RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS IN DECODING / 365
for a civilization that didn't otherwise dis¬
tinguish itself in many ways? It's true that
Mayan architecture was good within its lim¬
its. But there was precious little else that
these jungle dwelling Indians did which sug¬
gested they might have had the capacity (or
the need) to conceive of really long periods
of time" (1995:162).
This odd bit of reasoning betrays Han¬
cock's lack of understanding of Maya civili¬
zation and cosmology. Predictably, these
words preface his proposition that Egyptians
and, ultimately, the Atlanteans were the
great mysterious geniuses behind Maya sci¬
ence. Unfortunately, Hancock's thesis of a
foreign source for Maya astronomical and
calendric science must be disregarded. After
all, the tzolkin and the Long Count are
unique and uncomparable to any calendric
system developed elsewhere in the world.
Hancock did not explore where or when the
Long Count was invented or who created it,
nor did he make a connection between the
solstice-Galaxy alignment and the 2012 end
date. In general, Hancock's sources for sup¬
posedly cutting-edge ideas about Mesoameri
can civilization are outdated and have little
to contribute to current understanding. Fur¬
thermore, Hancock's view that the Maya
were incapable of independently developing
a complex calendar cosmology requires a dis¬
ingenuous dismissal of independent Maya
genius.
Adrian Gilbert and Maurice Cotterell's
The Mayan Prophecies (1995) attempted to
reveal the true meaning of the Maya end-date
in a.d. 2012, but it contains many misunder¬
standings and errors. Despite their book's
promise to supply an explanation for the end
date, the solstice-Galaxy alignment is nei¬
ther recognized or mentioned. Gilbert and
Cotterell both tried to answer the question
of why 2012 was so important to the Maya,
but they each took slightly different view¬
points. Cotterell's theory about the transfor¬
mative nature of 2012 is that sunspot cycles
give rise to larger solar aberrations in which
the sun's magnetic field periodically reverses,
causing the Earth's poles to shift and thus
resulting in cataclysm. According to Cot¬
terell, the solar reversals come in groups of
five, which together make a grand cycle of
18,139 years. The five "ages" are not all of
the same length, due to complex solar
rhythms that Cotterell modeled on a com¬
puter. Three of the ages last 3,553 years each,
whereas two last 3,740 years each. These are
supposed to correspond to the Maya/Aztec
myth of four or five ages. A key number here
is the number of days in 3,740 years, which
Cotterell calculated (using 365.25 days per
year) as 1366035. Cotterell noticed that this
magic number is "close" to a number in the
Dresden Codex, written in Long Count no¬
tation as 9.9.16.0.0. This corresponds to a
date in a.d. 627, which is 1,366,560 days af¬
ter the so-called Long Count "zero date" of
3114 b.c. The "closeness" of these numbers
(500+ days) is supposed to demonstrate that
the Maya were aware of sunspot cycles and
solar magnetic field reversals, and that is why
the Long Count pinpoints a.d. 2012 as a
World Age cataclysm. Gilbert writes, ". . .
Cotterell has concluded that the Maya proph¬
ecy for the end of the fifth age concerns a
reversal of the earth's magnetic field—around
a.d. 2012" (192). However, earlier in the book
we are led through an interesting lesson in
dendrochronology so we can understand how
field reversals of the past can be charted. In
this way, Cotterell identifies the dawn of the
Long Count (3114 b.c.) as the location of one
of these shifts. Consequently, a magic
1,366,035 days later, in a.d. 627, another shift
occurs. "What really intrigued Cotterell is
that they seemed to have anticipated the
magnetic reversal [of a.d. 627] and conse¬
quential decline in fertility, for the magic



366 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
number 1366560 corresponds to the mag¬
netic shift period" (185). The obvious prob¬
lem here is that the next magnetic shift
should take place 3,553 years after a.d. 627,
more than 2,000 years after a.d. 2012. No¬
where does the book address this discrepancy.
Cotterell also proposes that the Maya
collapse (which historically began around a.d.
800) was caused by a decline in fertility at¬
tended by the field-reversal of a.d. 627. In
Appendix 4, Cotterell shows that the field
reversal does not happen overnight, but over
a 374-year period. The year a.d. 627 is iden¬
tified as the "mid-point" of the shift, which
thus extended from a.d. 440 to a.d. 814. The
problem here is that this time period does
not correspond very well with the Maya de¬
cline,- in fact, it corresponds better with the
Classic-period florescence of Maya culture
(a.d. 300 to a.d. 900).
Gilbert, for his part, emphasizes the idea
that the beginning of the Long Count repre¬
sents a so-called "Birth of Venus," based
partly upon checking the date with his
Skyglobe astronomy software and partly on
the fact that the Maya supernumber 1366560
is divisible by 584. However, 584 is only an
approximation of the true 583.92-day cycle
of Venus, and, furthermore, 1366560 is also
divisible by the Mars cycle, the Mercury
cycle, the 365-day haab, the 360-day tun, the
18,980-day Calendar Round, and the 37,960
day Venus Round as well—this is why schol¬
ars call it the Maya supernumber. Gilbert
punched up a sky chart for August 12, 3114
b.c., the beginning date of the 13-baktun cycle
of the Long Count, and saw Venus just west
of the sun (136). This means that it was ris¬
ing in the morning just before the sun, tech¬
nically, in the morning star position. How¬
ever, this was not the first appearance of Ve¬
nus as morning star at the time, the "Venus
birth" scenario that concerned the Maya,
because, in fact, Venus was moving toward
superior conjunction on August 12 of 3114
b.c. It was not making its first appearance nor
was it even waxing toward its morning star
maximum. In fact, according to two differ¬
ent sources I consulted (EZCosmos and Az¬
tec Astro Report), Venus made its last appear¬
ance as morning star almost two weeks be¬
fore the Long Count zero-date. Although mi¬
nor variations are to be expected with com¬
puter modeling, Skyglobe provides the same
data and Gilbert must not have double
checked his findings. Based upon this faulty
observation, Gilbert begins referring to the
Long Count zero-date as "the Birth of Venus."
Gilbert's summary toward the end of the
book apparently is supposed to reveal one of
the miraculous breakthroughs about the as¬
tronomical basis of the 2012 end-date prom¬
ised by the book. But his observations are not
very compelling and are purely speculative,
with little basis in Maya cosmological con¬
cepts or traditions. In Gilbert's summational
look at the end-date astronomy, Skyglobe
revealed to him that "Venus sinks below the
western horizon as the Pleiades rise over the
eastern horizon. . . . [A]s the sun sets, Orion
rises, perhaps signifying the start of a new
precessional cycle" (211). And such is the fi¬
nal revelation. Clearly, these astronomical
observations are not very illustrative of vast
World Age shiftings. The Mayan Prophecies,
though hailed as inventive in popular re¬
views, is in my view an unfortunate example
of a good-risk marketing strategy based upon
Gilbert's previous success with The Orion
Mystery. For a detailed and complete review
of The Mayan Prophecies, see Jenkins (1995f).
William Sullivan's The Secret of the Incas
(1996) is a good example of solid independent
research, asking the right questions and find¬
ing the right answers. Following the trail
blazed by Hamlet’s Mill, Sullivan examined
Inca mythology with an eye toward decod¬
ing its astronomical underpinnings. The parts



APPENDIX 6. RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS IN DECODING / 367
of the sky that drew his attention were the
same ones that are involved in the Maya end
date of a.d. 2012. Sullivan drew from the im¬
portant pioneering work of Gary Urton (1981)
and explained the importance of the Milky
Way and its "dark-cloud" constellations in
Andean cosmology. In South America, the
bright central bulge of the Milky Way is high
in the sky, and the dark clouds in this area
are much more visible than in North Amer¬
ica. The dark-cloud forms recognized by
Andean skywatchers as a mother llama and
her baby suckling are located near the cen¬
tral bulge of the Galactic Center, confirm¬
ing the idea that the central bulge of the
Milky Way was conceived, in the indigenous
mind, as a Creation Place or Cosmic Mother
womb. Nearby, at the crossing point of the
Milky Way and the ecliptic, Sullivan identi¬
fied the dark-cloud constellation called Atoq
—the Fox. This dark cloud is just south of
the dark-rift that the Quiche Maya call the
xibalba be. The two dark-cloud forms are
close but not identical. Sullivan's thesis is
that the precession-caused shiftings of the rise
times of the Fox constellation were noticed
by early Andean astronomers. Always care¬
fully documenting his search, Sullivan ex¬
plores fox-related myth and folklore and de¬
codes a complex mythic-astronomy con¬
cerned with tracking precession. In general,
Sullivan believed that it was the last helia¬
cal rise of the Milky Way on the June sol¬
stice of a.d. 650 that marked a critical mo¬
ment in Andean history. Notice that the same
precession-caused convergence that resulted
in the Milky Way no longer being visible at
dawn on the June solstice of a.d. 650 is the
same movement that causes the Maya sol
stice-Galaxy conjunction in a.d. 2012.
Sullivan went further in pointing out that
a Saturn-Jupiter conjunction occurred on the
June solstice of a.d. 650. This is significant,
because Hamlet’s Mill proposed that Saturn
Jupiter conjunctions (three of which equal
roughly sixty years) were used in ancient
times to track precession. Here I should men¬
tion that some Maya scholars believe the
Long Count originally developed from, and
is based upon, the twenty-year katun period.
For example, Hall (1989-1993a) believed the
katun period was designed to represent Sat¬
urn-Jupiter conjunctions; 260 katuns equal
the Great Cycle of thirteen baktuns, which
ends on the solstice-Galaxy alignment.
Overall, Sullivan's scholarship and in¬
sights are welcome in an era of scholastic
intolerance for anything that goes beyond the
limited one-dimensional conclusions of ten¬
ured academes. Sullivan has identified the
precession paradigm as it manifested in
South America. Technically speaking, the
formulation of it is pre-Inca by a long shot;
it highlights Tiahuanaco as its likely place
of origin. Scholars and independent thinkers
should look carefully at Sullivan's important
work. I do not have the space here for a full
review of its important insights, but can of¬
fer some comments regarding how it relates
to Maya cosmology.
Andean precessional astronomy is di¬
rectly related to my reconstruction of the
precessional myth among the Maya, but an
important difference drew Sullivan's atten¬
tion away from the solstice-Galaxy align¬
ment in era 2012. Sullivan focused on an
Andean interest in the last heliacal rise con¬
cept, whereas the Maya were interested in
conjunction. In terms of field effects and the
role played by the Galactic Center in the
Maya Galactic Cosmology, conjunction
would seem to be a very important require¬
ment for World Age transformation. Sullivan
did venture into Maya myth and astronomy,
looking for supportive data and other clues
to aid his reconstruction work. Unfortu¬
nately, he relied heavily on Raphael Girard's
interpretation of the Popol Vuh (1979), which



368 / MAYA C05M06ENESI5 2012
offers some insights into Popol Vuh mythol¬
ogy, but is outdated and contains rather ec¬
centric identifications of Popol Vuh deities.
Girard's voluminous work on the Chorti and
Quiche, obtained during ethnographic vis¬
its between the 1930s and the 1950s, is in¬
credibly valuable to modern researchers.
However, his Popol Vuh translation origi¬
nally appeared in Spanish in 1948 and was
finally translated into English in 1979. So,
the Popol Vuh source used by Sullivan is a
translation of a translation of a Conquest
era document that in turn was rendered from
an ancient hieroglyphic book (D. Tedlock
1985). Unfortunately, Sullivan did not access
the important translation by Dennis Tedlock
(1985), which had a great sensitivity to as¬
tronomy in the Popol Vuh. In fact, Barbara
Tedlock and Dennis Tedlock's prolific ethno¬
graphic work, which identifies the cosmic
crossroads, the Black Road, the xibalba be
dark-rift, and other important elements of
Maya myth and symbology that have direct
bearing on precessional astronomy in Meso
america, was not mentioned in Sullivan's
book. Nevertheless, Sullivan has accom¬
plished a great work and his book must be
acknowledged as the first in-depth explora¬
tion of ancient precessional cosmology in the
New World.

Guatemala, and it is the same one that was
followed at the great Classic-period cities of
the Maya. The need to clarify this informa¬
tion came in response to books on the Maya
proclaiming to provide an authentic count of
days, when, in fact, what I termed Newly Cre¬
ated Counts or Variant Counts were being pro¬
moted. For clarifications on this point, see

370 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
CHAPTER 2: CALENDRICS: MAPPING
METHODS
1. The word tzolkin is derived from the Maya
phrase chol qij, meaning "count of days." See
B. Tedlock (1982).
2. D. Tedlock (1993:233-234). I prefer Tedlock's
English translation of the Quiche day-signs be¬
cause the Quiche daykeeper tradition can claim
an unbroken lineage back to the pre-Conquest
period, and Dennis Tedlock is not only a Quiche
language translator, having produced the defini¬
tive translation of the Popol Vuh, but is also a
trained daykeeper (B. Tedlock 1982). Readers
may be familiar with other day-sign lists, which
are based on other Mesoamerican language
groups. For example, the Yucatec day-signs,
adapted from the records of Diego de Landa,
equate Quiche Imox (Lefthanded) with Imix (Al¬
ligator). This day-sign in the Aztec calendar is
Cipactli, which means Crocodile. Though lin¬
guistic variations exist, the inner order of the
day-signs has a common genetic base. For ex¬
ample, the parallel day-sign order between the
Quiche and the Yucatec day counts is apparent
from similarities such as Kawuq and Cauac,
Imox and Imix, Iq’ and Ik, Aq’ab’al and Akbal.
For a comparative list of day-signs from differ¬
ent groups, see Scofield (1994:39).
3. I have explored the philosophical, metaphysi¬
cal, and spiritual dimensions of Maya time phi¬
losophy in previous publications. See Jenkins
(1991, 1994a, 1994b, and 1994c).
4. Two Calendar Round periods equal one Venus
Round (of just under 104 years). I do not discuss
the Venus Round calendar separately here be¬
cause it is based upon the Calendar Round. Sur¬
viving Maya books, such as the Dresden Codex,
contain data about the astronomical movements
of Venus, which alternately rises as eveningstar
and morningstar in distinct, calculable intervals.
In Jenkins (1994a), I reconstructed the Maya
Venus calendar and determined that the next
Venus Round cycle will begin when Venus rises
as morningstar on April 3, 2001. This date in
the tzolkin calendar is 1 Ahau, the traditional
Sacred Day of Venus for the Classic Maya.
5. N'oj means thought in Quiche (D. Tedlock 1993);
it is equivalent to Caban in the Yucatec system.
6. Edmonson (1988:194).
7. To be more specific, this is called the end-date
of the 13-baktun cycle of the Long Count calen¬
dar. It should be clarified here that the "zero"
date of the 13-baktun cycle is August 11, while
the "first" day is properly called August 12. A
recurrent misconception in the academic litera¬
ture results in an erroneous end-date of Decem¬
ber 23, rather than December 21.1 analyzed this
problem very carefully in my book Tzolkin: Vi¬
sionary Perspectives and Calendar Studies.
From Jenkins (1994d:57,100): "Linda Scheie and
David Freidel, unlike most Mayanists, continue
to support the work of Floyd Lounsbury in pro¬
moting the 584285 correlation. This is two days
off the Thompson correlation that I use. The
decisive factor in supporting the Thompson cor¬
relation of 584283 is the fact that it corresponds
with the tzolkin count still followed in the high¬
lands of Guatemala. ..." See Appendix 5, "Re¬
sponse to Counterarguments," in this book, for
a more detailed clarification.

2. Carrasco (1990:21).
3. Carrasco (1990:21).
4. In keeping with the Mesoamerican concept of
sky-Earth unity, the biological or organic realm
of Earth was also understood to generate time;
the tzolkin models both of these realms. See
Jenkins (1991, 1994a).
5. By "zenith," I here mean the exact center of the
sky. Some sources confuse "meridian transit"
with "zenith" transit. A star's meridian transit
is the highest point it reaches during its nightly
arch through the sky. For some stars, such as
the Pleiades, this meridian transit can reach the
zenith during certain times of the year.
6. I acknowledge the possibility of trans-Pacific
contact from China (e.g., Martinez 1990), but

Olmec used for astronomical sighting.

2. Kelley's model is important because it contrib¬
uted to Linda Scheie's breakthrough reconstruc¬
tion of Maya Creation mythology, which she
presented at the Austin Hieroglyphic meeting
in 1992. See Scheie (1992b).
3. Kelley (1989).
4. Kelley anticipates the importance of his pioneer¬
ing work: "Detailed analysis of related myths
and study of other sequences will, I think, even¬
tually allow us to reconstruct much of the un¬
derlying mythology and see how it is assigned
to various parts of the sky" (1989:77). It thus
seems that Kelley provided the key to under¬
standing Maya cosmology: The dark-rift is a
place where time begins and ends. Unfortu¬
nately, he did not follow up on the implications
of his discovery, nor did he recognize the align¬
ment in a.d. 2012.1 feel that Linda Scheie's later
work (Scheie 1992b, Freidel et al. 1993) is based
upon Kelley's ideas, and her reconstruction of
Maya Creation mythology does, in fact, utilize
the belt stars of Orion as a critical key. How¬
ever, the equally important placement of the
dark-rift in Kelley's model did not, for some rea¬
son, enter into her reconstruction. This loop¬
hole in academia is where I picked up the thread,
and my research has been driven by the realiza¬
tion that the dark-rift near the cosmic crossroads
is the place of World Age Creation.

11. Scholars do not recognize the impact of exter¬
nal New Age influence on Maya people and
tradition. The New Age Hunab Ku symbol
comes from the Nuttall Codex, a Central
Mexican rather than a Maya source. Hunab Ku
is a term that was popularized in the books of
Jose Arguelles and the Yucatecan daykeeper
Hunbatz Men. It is currently used by thousands
of Mexicans, Mayas, and fans of Maya culture.
Rather than dismissing this term as invalid,
scholars are obliged to recognize it, document

ascending into the zenith as the Pleiades may
have to do with the Pleiades at the top of an¬
other World Axis—the zenith axis. Moreover,
considering the nature of the Zenith Cosmol¬
ogy, the implication is that the Pleiades and
its ascent to the zenith may have been used to
track precession.

21. One potential problem with Hamlet's Mill's
focus on the polar area is the fact that the Pole
Star is very low in the sky at tropical latitudes.
Hunrakan may in some contexts refer to a dif¬
ferent cosmic axis, perhaps the zenith axis or
even the Galactic. My feeling is that he, like
Tezcatlipoca, was originally the Polar God, but
adopted variant meanings as cosmological un¬
derstanding evolved in Mesoamerica. Ulti¬
mately, the question of where the true cosmic
center is located was resolved with the Long
Count's end-date marker on the Galactic Cen¬
ter.

PART II: THE UNION OF CAPTAIN
SERPENT AND CAPTAIN SUN DISK
CHAPTER 6: THE PYRAMID OF
KUKULCAN: A COSMIC MYTH IN
STONE
1. The terms Captain Sun Disk and Captain Ser¬
pent are the names for these Maya-Toltec dei¬
ties preferred by epigrapher Linda Scheie and
archaeologist David Freidel in their book For¬
est of Kings (1990).
2. Diaz-Bolio (1988).
3. One source for this identification is Redfield and
Villa Rojas (1971:206): "The Pleiades bear the
name of the rattlesnake's rattle (tzab)-" An¬
other source is Carlson (1990), where a diagram
shows the Pleiades as a rattlesnake rattle. The
Lacandon Maya share this identification of the
Pleiades as a rattlesnake rattle (Bruce et al. 1971);
Milbrath (1980a) summarizes additional data on
this topic.
4. The latitude that defines the limits of the trop¬
ics (23°26') is directly related to the obliquity of
the echptic—the tilt of the Earth in relation to
its orbital plane.
5. Anthony Aveni, Horst Hartung, and Charles
Kelley explored an amazing astronomical obser¬
vatory situated on the tropic of Cancer in
Zacatecas, Mexico. See Aveni et al. (1982). The
context of this site suggests it was a remote
outpost of Teotihuacan. As at Chichen Itza, this
town experienced a flood of refugees from
Teotihuacan in the eighth and ninth centuries.
The presence of Central Mexican astronomer
priests at this site suggests they were very in¬
terested in calibrating the different zenith-pas¬
sage phenomena occurring at different latitudes.
6. Contrary to a popular misconception, the Pleia¬
des do not rise heliacally on July 26. The term
"heliacal " designates the date of the first appear¬
ance of a celestial feature in the pre-dawn skies.
For the Pleiades, this currently occurs in early
June. While it is true that the Pleiades can be
found in the eastern pre-dawn sky on July 26,
that date does not have any distinct significance
in the cycle of the Pleiades.
7. Juan Pio Perez's "Cronologia Antigua de Yucatan
y Examen del Metodo con que los Indios Con
taba el Tiempo; Sacada de Varios Documentos
Antiguos" was reproduced in Stephens ([1843]
1963^278-303).
8. In astronomical terminology, from day to day
the declination of the sun changes very little at
this time of year. At the solstices, the sun's dec¬
lination does not change at all, and then it re¬
verses.
9. Aveni and Hartung (1981). In this essay, Aveni
and Hartung note that "... a fundamental
coordinate axis in the Mesoamerican celestial
reference frame consisted of four lines connect¬
ing the world to the four cardinal points, a fifth
axis being directed toward the zenith" (S51-S52).
10. In fact, the timing of zenith passages at a given



END NOTES / 373
latitude does vary slightly as the obliquity of
the ecliptic changes, but these effects are so
minor, even over millennia, that they can be
disregarded.

13. The sun-Pleiades-zenith alignment is latitude
specific and thus it has special meaning for the
modern Yucatec Maya. It may herald a cultural
resurgence based upon a reclaiming of their an¬
cient knowledge.
CHAPTER 7: THE TRUE MEANING OF
THE NEW FIRE CEREMONY
1. See Drucker (1986). Drucker's contribution to
reconstructing the origins of the New Fire cer¬
emony at Toltec Teotihuacan is summarized in
Coggins (1989). For a discussion of the New Fire
ceremony at Chichen Itza, see Coggins (1987).
2. Slightly revising the chronology offered by other
scholars, Clemency Coggins (1989) argues con¬
vincingly for an early ninth-century building of
the Caracol and Pyramid of Kukulcan at Chi¬
chen Itza. According to Coggins, their construc¬
tion as astronomical and mythological knowl¬
edge-capsules was completed around the con¬
clusion of baktun 10 (a.d. 830). This Long Count
baktun shift was an important event in itself,
probably fraught with the same anxiety that all
cycle endings brought to Mesoamerican people.
This baktun-shift context reinforces the idea
that calibrating the great cycles of time (e.g., the
precession of the equinoxes) was very much on
the minds of those unknown skywatchers who
designed the Pyramid of Kukulcan at Chichen
Itza.
3. Sahagun's history of New Spain is translated in
Anderson and Dibble (1953).
4. The November 14 New Fire date of a.d. 1507
was calculated by astronomer E.C. Krupp (1982).
Mesoamerican scholar Johanna Broda recog¬
nized the dualistic dynamic between the events
in May and November (1982b, 1992), but does
not draw the potentially controversial conclu¬
sion that the Aztecs were really interested in
calculating the future convergence of the ever
changing exact date of the sun-Pleiades conjunc¬
tion with the static date of the solar-zenith pas¬
sage. Furthermore, no scholars have recognized
that the midnight zenith transit of the Pleiades
defines the date of the sun-Pleiades conjunction
six months later. Milbrath (1980a) also recog¬
nizes the May-November opposition, but, like
Broda, only in a general way.
5. This suggests that the universal principles of
Sacred Geometry underlie Mesoamerican sci¬
ence and calendrics. The pioneering astronomer
Johannes Kepler used the Platonic Solids in his
geometrical model of the solar system, wherein
the orbits of the visible planets were accurately
spaced according to the five Platonic Solids.
These geometrical shapes are constructed from
the sacred ratio known as the Golden Mean. In
my book Jaloj Kexoj and PHI-64 (1994) I explored
the Tzutujil philosophy involving the concepts
of regeneration and multiplication (Jaloj Kexoj)
and compared this indigenous time philosophy
with the mathematical principles I had deter¬
mined were at the core of the Maya tzolkin cal¬
endar (one of which is the Golden Mean).

2. Milbrath (1980b:452).
3. Milbrath (1980b:453). That these concepts may
go as far back as Izapa should not be regarded as
unlikely. Milbrath's evidence for this is the role
played by the Pleiades and the zenith sun in the
orientation of Teotihuacan (Dow 1967). Impor¬
tantly, early Teotihuacan influenced early
Kaminaljuyu, and the travel route between these
two major Pre-Classic cities passed right by
Izapa.

10. The South American Aymara Indian word

at least one Native American group thought
of the sun and the Pleiades as a united entity
(Sullivan 1996:371).

17. In this symbology, the two meanings for the
serpent's tail are the year-sign and the Pleia¬
des. Rather than assume that these meanings
are completely unrelated, we are probably safer
in assuming some form of metaphoric paral¬
lelism in which the year-sign and the Pleiades
are, in fact, reflections of an underlying con¬
ceptual unity.
18. Joyce (1915).
19. Maldonado and Tio (1991).
20. It should also be noted here that archaeolo¬
gists found cleft-head figurines in the early art
of Teotihuacan (Hasso von Winning 1976:153).
This motif continuity into the Toltec era sug¬
gests a conceptual link from the Olmec up
through the Toltec and probably through the
Post-Classic Mesoamerican cultures as well.
21. Digby (1972). Digby also mentioned that J. Eric
S. Thompson pointed out to him that the
Xiuhcoatl serpent has a trapezoidal year-sign
symbol for a tail (Digby 1972:436). This gives
us more reason for allowing a connection be¬
tween the zenith and the year-bearer symbols.
Not all scholars agree with Digby's hypothesis
that the year-signs represent an astronomical
shadow-measuring instrument. Sharon Gibbs,
in her article "The First Scientific Instru¬
ments" (1979), briefly discusses Digby's claim
and reproduces the trapezoidal year-sign from
the Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl at Xochicalco. She
calls the upper trapezoid design a "crown" that
"seems to refer to a calendar year" (59). She
writes that Digby claims this is an astronomi¬
cal instrument "despite the lack of convinc¬
ing evidence that Mesoamericans would have
been interested in the information supplied by
such an instrument" (59). This is really a sur¬
prising statement, especially when we consider
that Gibbs collaborated with Anthony Aveni
on the archaeoastronomical studies at Chichen
Itza (Aveni and Gibbs 1975), and should thus
be aware of the astronomical interests of the
Mesoamerican skywatchers. As can be seen in
Diagram 43, the design in question shows a
trapezoid "instrument" casting a shadow
downward that has the form of a symmetrical
cross. This kind of symmetrical shadow will
be cast by the "instrument" only on the date
of a solar zenith passage. In addition, there is a
zenith tube at Xochicalco that has been exam¬
ined and measured by archaeoastronomers.
Thus, zenith observations were made at Xo¬
chicalco. As such, the trapezoid instrument
portrayed on the Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl at
Xochicalco is perfectly designed to identify the
dates of solar zenith passages, information that
Mesoamericans, especially the ones at Xochi¬
calco, were in fact very interested in.
22. This is also what I feel the New Fire ceremony
was designed to track. Scholars have described
only part of what this ceremony meant—that
it was concerned with observing the Pleiades
pass through the zenith on a New Year's Day
(at midnight). In this chapter, I synthesized
additional material to reconstruct the full im¬
port of the New Fire ceremony, showing that
it was really concerned with tracking when,
in the distant future, the sun and the Pleiades
join and pass through the zenith together.

25. If Amazonia-Yucatan connections seem far¬
fetched, scholars have already discussed in
great length the probable contact between the
Olmec civilization on the Gulf Coast of
Mexico and the Chavin culture in Peru, which
took place around 1200 b.c. (Coe 1962; Evans
and Meggars 1966; Opperman 1983). Michael
Coe (1960) excavated a site named La Victoria
on the Pacific Coast of Guatemala (quite close
to Izapa) and saw probable connections with a
contemporary culture in coastal Peru.

END NOTES / 375
(1980a:293, 297), and her conclusions support
my comments on the opposition between the
Pleiades (the rattlesnake rattle) and the dark
rift near Sagittarius-Scorpio (the snake's
mouth). The Milky Way thus might be seen as
a huge snake, as it is in South American cos¬
mologies and in Mesoamerica. Its tail is the
Pleiades and its mouth is the dark-rift. The Ple¬
iades and the dark-rift are roughly opposed in
the sky and both lie near the two crossroads
formed by the Milky Way and the ecliptic.

chart, e.g., Ridpath and Tirion (1987).
4. For a good map of the southern Milky Way, see
Schaaf (1996:66-67).
5. Modern scholars' emphasis on extreme accu¬
racy in these matters is a form of misplaced
concretism, which assumes that ancient people
placed an equal importance on pinpoint accu¬
racy, even when they were capable of it. The
compelling nature of Maya end-date cosmology
has potent mythological value; the thought com¬
plex that arises, like many other aesthetically
appealing paradigms, can be scientifically invali¬
dated because it does not fit modern science's
criterion of accuracy. Clearly, this is a double
standard, but it does serve to protect science's
assumption that it belongs to the most advanced
paradigm yet created by human beings.

2. B. Tedlock (1992) points out that the Orion
nebula was not reported in Medieval astro¬
nomical sources, and thus may not have even
existed during the Maya Classic period. This
challenges Scheie's interpretation of the Orion
nebula as the primal fire of ancient Maya Cre¬
ation mythology.

explicitly offers this reconstruction in his trans¬

5. Furst (1981).
6. For additional information, Joann Roman Bris
ko's 1993 M.A. thesis (Aztec Goddesses) thor¬
oughly explores the identity and role of female
deities in Mesoamerican cosmology. Citlalini
cue and Coatlicue have associations with the
Milky Way. Also see Brundage (1979:35-37),
"Star Skirt and Her Children," an Aztec story
in which the Goddess Star Skirt (the Milky Way)
gives birth to many deities, including Quetzal
coatl and Tezcatlipoca. Brundage writes, "She
[Citlalinicue] was the Great Mother of the stars
and as such was peculiarly incarnate in the
Milky Way" (35). Citlalinicue was the Mother
of the Gods, and "enthroned in the Milky Way
Star Skirt [Citlalinicue] was the source of all
wisdom. . . ." (35).
7. In The Orion Mystery, Robert Bauval discusses
Egyptian cosmology and the astronomy near the
Milky Way/ecliptic crossing point in Gemini,
in which Orion, Sirius, and the Milky Way play
key roles. It is quite thought-provoking that both
the Egyptians and the Maya recognized Orion
in their Creation mythologies, and an intuitive
insight about that part of the sky may be at the
root of the shared interest. The Gemini cross¬
ing-point indicates the direction to travel out
of the Galaxy; in a sense, it is the doorway out
of the local neighborhood. The Sagittarian cross¬
ing-point, on the other hand, points our way into
the Galaxy—into the Galaxy's center and the
mysteries of the origin of time and space that
reside there. In other words, the Sagittarian
crossroads signifies an inner orientation whereas
the Gemini/Orion crossroads represents an out¬
ward looking, or objective, orientation to life.
In the context of the model of a unified Zenith
Cosmology and Galactic Cosmology presented
in Part II, the polarity between the zenith-cen¬
ter passage of the Pleiades (near Gemini) and
the Galactic Center passage of the December
solstice sun refers to a polarity between inner
orientation and outer orientation—the subject
object polarity in human thought, or the inner



376 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
outer polarity present in philosophical models
of reality. The synthesis of the Zenith Cosmol¬
ogy and the Galactic Cosmology, as achieved at
ninth-century Chichen Itza, thus represents a
transcendence of dualistic thinking in general,
a worldview in which inner and outer realities
are understood and perceived to be inextricably
interwoven. This view, of course, is recogniz¬
able as the ancient "as above, so below" doc¬
trine. These considerations are beyond the scope
of the present book, as they access more meta¬
physical aspects of Mesoamerican time philoso¬
phy; for more on this perspective, see Jenkins
(1991, 1994a:8-21, and 1994c).
8. In my book The Cen ter of Mayan Time (Jenkins
1995a) I demonstrated how One Ahau corre¬
sponds to the December solstice quarter. It is
the primary year-bearer, the senior day-sign,
corresponding to the senior seasonal quarter.
9. According to Lowe (et al. 1982), there are proto¬
typal tun and katun glyphs at Izapa. The first
Long Count dates in the archaeological record
date to the first century b.c. One is from Tres
Zapotes, one is from Chiapa de Corzo north of
Izapa, and several other Cycle 7 dates are within
the Izapan sphere of influence.
10. Freidel et al. (1993:89).
11. Sullivan (1996:371). Sullivan relates that the
dimmest stars can be seen at heliacal rise when
the sun is at least 20° below the horizon. For
the dimmer contrast between the Milky Way
and its dark-cloud formations, a further 4° is
required, given clear stargazing conditions.
This means that the last time the dark-rift was
visible rising heliacally on the December sol¬
stice was about 1,700 years ago.
CHAPTER 11. THE COSMIC SYMBOLISM
OF THE MAYA BALLCAME
1. Krickeberg (1966), cited in Fash and Kowalski
(1991:59).
2. Braun (1982:65). Elsewhere: "[A] typical verti¬
cal cross section of a ballcourt graphically por¬
trays the stepped 'jaws of the earth/ and again
the entrance to the Underworld" (Parsons 1991:
197). Regarding Cauac monster symbolism, see
Tate (1982).
3. This third level should be looked at closely. It
involves the movement of the December sol¬
stice sun (as the gameball), but what does this
mean? The "movement" of the solstice sun only
occurs against background features such as stars
and the Milky Way, and thus precession is an
unavoidable factor in the cosmic symbolism of
the ballgame.
4. Parsons (1991:197).
5. See, for example, James Brady's "The Sexual
Connotation of Caves in Mesoamerican Ideol¬
ogy" (1988); Doris Heyden (1975); Bassie-Sweet
(1991).
6. Laughlin (1975:132).
7. In addition to these sources, Peter
Furst wrote "the triangular cleft,
along with the ubiquitous U ele¬
ment, is a gender-specific female
symbol in Mesoamerica. ... As a kind of cos¬
mic vaginal passageway through which plants
or ancestors emerge from the underworld, it can
be found in many places"(1981:151). Also, Ma¬
tos Moctezuma (1995:32) relates that caves were
perceived as wombs capable of giving birth to
individuals or entire groups of people. Chico
moztoc, the Aztec origin place, is portrayed as
a womb in the Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca. In
other pre-hispanic art, walls of caves are depicted
in the same way used to indicate skin. Bassie
Sweet writes: "A womb/vagina is represented
in many Mesoamerican birth metaphors by a
cave" (1991:77). The conceptual association be¬
tween caves and the birth passage is universal
and well-established. We can take this a step
further and equate the dark-rift in the Milky
Way (the cave in the sky) with the vagina of a
cosmic female deity, whom we may call the
Cosmic Mother. The Aztec goddess Citlalinicue
(Star Skirt) is the Milky Way (Brisko 1993), and
in fact gave birth to Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatli
poca (Brundage 1979:35-37). Clearly, the dark
rift would be her birthing passage.
8. This very same figure is called the Witz "moun¬
tain" monster in Scheie and Freidel (1990:68).
9. On murals from Chichen Itza and elsewhere,
the gameball is depicted as a skull or contain¬
ing a skull. Likewise, in the Popol Vuh, One
Hunahpu's head is used as the gameball. One



END NOTES / 377
Hunahpu's head represents the dead sun, prior
to its rebirth. Among the present-day Maya in
Guatemala, corn seed is thought of as "little
skulls." When they are planted, it is as if they
make a heroic journey through the Underworld,
to be reborn as new plants. This connection re¬
veals a major aspect of the ballgame's meaning.
The ballgame is also about the resurrection of
the Maize God, who ultimately is a reflection
of One Hunahpu, the First Father. As I have ex¬
plained elsewhere, First Father or One Ahau re¬
fers to the sun, specifically, the December sol¬
stice sun. The Maize Deity, as the agricultural
symbol of fertility and life, is understood by the
Maya to be an aspect of First Father. Typically,
as in the Aztec pantheon, Maya deities have an
array of identifications and attributes that are
frequently shared. The most important thing to
stress here is the idea that the Maize Deity must
be killed before he can be reborn. Likewise, One
Hunahpu is killed by the Xibalban Lords before
he is eventually resurrected by his sons, the Hero
Twins. In the ballgame symbolism of solar re¬
birth, the idea must have been that the sun must
die, travel through a period in the Underworld,
and can then be reborn. This relates to the im¬
portant role played by sacrifice in the ballgame.
Part of the ritual game involved the sacrifice of
either the winner or the loser, reflecting the
Mesoamerican idea that deities (or deity-imper¬
sonators) must be sacrificed prior to world-re¬
newal. Simply put, death feeds new life.

11. Many scholars agree. See Fash and Kowalski
(1991:66); Brundage (1979:10); Krickeberg
(1966:248-249); Reilly (1995:31). Also, Klein
(1976a:30), citing Thompson, discusses the
reversibility of up and down concepts "depend¬
ing on whether celestial or terrestrial matters
were under consideration" (Thompson 1970:
196).
12. Wren (1995).
13. Wren (1991:51).
14. Of course, it equally portrays solar rebirth on
the daily and annual levels,- however, the
goalring iconography is particularly suggestive
of the dark-rift overhead and thus the World
Age level of rebirth. The actual date on the
Ballcourt Stone was deciphered by Wren
(1995:3) as 10.1.15.3.6, which is November 15,
864 (Gregorian) via the 584283 correlation (the
True Count).
15. Earlier, I described the sky over the Chichen
Itza ballcourt on the June solstice. Here, at
Tonina, we may have an indication of the dark
rift "far below"—at the nadir—rather than
overhead. The symbolism contained on the
marker stone, as well as the hole underneath,
certainly suggests this, for there is no "black
hole" overhead at midnight on the December
solstice,- instead, like other hearths and offer¬
ing holes, the "black hole" lies at the deepest
point of the Underworld below. Rather than
seeming contradictory, we may glimpse here
a complex cosmovision that sees the dark-rift
portal in the night sky (on the June solstice)
and deep below the ground (on the December
solstice). Furthermore, we should remember
that the Maya perceived "the Underworld" as
the night sky.

17. Scheie and Freidel (1991:309).
18. In the same essay, the authors discuss various
Creation texts, pointing out that certain im¬
portant events happen in the portal to the
Otherworld, a location referred to with the
hieroglyph that translates as "black hole"
(Scheie and Freidel 1991:291). This black hole
is associated with cenotes, Underworld portals,
sinkholes, skeletal and serpent maws, ball
courts, king accessions, and "birth" events. See
Appendix 4 for a more detailed look at the
black hole in Maya Creation texts.
19. I am grateful to Dawn Jenkins for suggesting
this.
20. See Quirarte (1974).
21. The Toltec and Aztec version of the ballgame
also has associations with their concept of the
World Age "end-date." The gameball was large
and made of rubber and, as mentioned, repre¬
sented the sun. "Ol" means rubber, as in
"Olmec" (the Rubber People). In the Aztec cal¬
endar, the seventeenth day-sign Ollin means
"movement." In the Aztec cosmology, Ollin
is the day-sign on which the present World Age
or "Sun" is to end. Thus, the rubber ball rep



378 / MAYA CO5MO0ENE5I5 7012
resents the movement of the present World
Age's sun.
22. The Aztec end-date was calculated by Tony
Shearer (1975:115) to occur in August, 1987.
However, his math is inaccurate by over one
hundred days (see Jenkins 1996f). Interestingly,
however, Shearer equates the tzolkin date 1
Imix with August 16, 1987(1975:116, 154), re¬
vealing he used a correlation that was only one
day out of step with the 584283 correlation.

According to Miller and Taube (1993:141-142),
the earliest appearance of the quetzal serpent
in Central Mexico occurred at Toltec Teotihua
can in the third century a.d. That the Teotihua
cano astronomer-priests were interested in the
Pleiades and the zenith sun is evident in the
orientation of the city, as outlined in Part I.
Given these facts, a conceptual association be¬
tween the Pleiades, the zenith sun, the New Fire
ceremony, and the Toltec Plumed Serpent, Que
tzalcoatl, is likely.

4. In my close scrutiny of the zenith-passage phe¬
nomenon, I realized that a range of days fulfills
the "no shadow at high noon" criterion. The
range depends upon one's latitude of observa¬

more recent essay, Tedlock corrects himself and
offers a scenario suggesting that she is really the

One Hunahpu is the December solstice sun.
Here we are reminded that Mesoamerican dei¬
ties typically rule sectors of time or abstract
principles or forces rather than objects. Over¬
all, One Hunahpu represents the philosophical
concept of new birth, which applies to the De¬
cember solstice sun as well as the heliacal rise
of Venus as morning star.

8. However, it is possible that the mytho-astro
nomical meaning behind the conception of the
Hero Twins, and perhaps the whole episode it¬
self, is a late innovation. We may even think it
to be a specifically Quiche manifestation, per¬
haps eight hundred years old, but Tedlock deci¬
phers these references at the Classic site of



END NOTES / 379
Palenque (1992:250), as well as in the Dresden
Codex and the Popol Vuh. Our other range,
therefore, may be during the Classic Period prior
to the dedication of Palenque's Temple of the
Cross, say, a.d. 300 to a.d. 690.1 favor the antiq¬
uity of sophisticated knowledge, and place the
origin of the mytho-astronomical conception of
the Hero Twins way back to Izapa.
9. EZCosmos 3.1 and Skyglobe 3.6 (both of which
adjust for precession).
10. In the interest of thoroughness, we may choose
to look at a Palenque context for the "syzygy
in the mouth" signature of the Hero Twins'
conception. I did a brief search for this and,
frankly, found nothing in the seventh century
a.d. so interesting as the second and first cen¬
tury b.c. dates examined. One exception is a
very close conjunction of Jupiter-Venus-moon
right in the dark-rift mouth, on December 10,
714 (Julian). The problem here is that the
Temple of the Cross had already been dedicated
decades earlier, and that is where D. Tedlock
finds his Palenque source for the Hero Twins'
conception. Ultimately, by the time Palenque
came on the scene, it may have been an an¬
cient ritual event, commemorated whenever
it occurred, and deeply a part of age-old folk
mythology. Neither should it be lost upon us
that, in any language, the "conception" of the
Hero Twins contains an implicit pun. In other
words, the "conception" of the myth about the
Hero Twins' "conception." (Punning is a won¬
derful trait of the Maya, modern or ancient.)
11. Aveni (1984:255).
12. David Fideler, in his book Jesus Christ, Sun of
God (1993), explores the esoteric symbolism
behind early Christian cosmology. The esoteric
number for Jesus, 888, represents the Ogdoad,
the Spiritual Sun "behind" the physical sun.
Jesus, as the "Sun behind the sun" was an ex¬
pression of higher truth for the early Christian
gnostics (Fideler 1993:270-1). In reading Fide
ler's material on this esoteric understanding
of Jesus, I could not help thinking about the
Maya end-date cosmology. The "spiritual sun
behind the physical sun" would be the invis¬
ible Galactic Center in conjunction with the
December solstice sun. One might therefore
suspect that the end-date conjunction is the
"second coming" prophesied by early Chris¬
tian astrologers.
CHAPTER 14: A HAWK, A CROSS, AND
A MOUTH
1. Ethnographer Judith Remington gathered
enough detailed information to understand that
the Thieves' Cross is made up of stars belong¬
ing to Sagittarius. Barbara Tedlock followed this
lead with information from her own field study
of the Maya in "Hawks, Meteorology and As¬
tronomy in Quiche Maya Agriculture." Tedlock
confirms and clarifies the earlier information
offered by Remington. Her observations were
primarily made in Momostenango, Guatemala,
in the mid-1970s. When the Swainson's hawks
pass overhead in October or November on their
way south, they are said to "drop the Cross"
into the ocean, thus signaling the dry season.
This cross is a constellation, a "bent cross" that
is "not straight but rather was inclined to its
left" (B. Tedlock 1985:83), which proves to be
the Thieves' Cross in Sagittarius identified by
Remington (1977:85-87). There are no illustra¬
tions of this constellation in either Remington's
or Tedlock's papers, but a list of the stars in this
cross allows us to chart it. The stars in the
Thieves' Cross constellation are:
a) Sigma (mag. 2.1)
b) Phi (mag. 3.2)
c) Delta (mag. 2.7)
d) Gamma (mag. 3.0)
e) Lambda (mag. 2.8)
f) Epsilon (mag. 1.8)
g) Eta (mag. 3.1)

9. In the Central Mexican Borgia Codex, an inter¬
esting picture portrays the birth of Venus in the



380 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
form of a rabbit. Rabbit, the eighth day-sign, is
called Lamat in the Yucatec Maya language, and
its glyph resembles a cross (see diagram below).
The Borgia scene is very similar to the astronomi¬
cal scenario sketched above. A bird is pulling the
rabbit out of the mouth of a serpent:
Lamat-Venus glyph and Birth of Venus in the Borgia Codex
Notice the cloud-scrolls
along the body of the ser¬
pent, indicating that this is
Mixcoatl, the Milky Way
serpent (Miller and Taube
1993). The mouth must be
the dark-rift. The bird, also "attached" to the
Milky Way, may be the Xic (Hawk) constella¬
tion of the Quiche, the Old World Aquila. Again,
this star group easily lends itself to being viewed
as a bird. The Borgia scene shows the bird pull¬
ing Venus (the rabbit) out of the mouth of the
Milky Way (the dark-rift). At the same time, the
mouth of the bird may symbolize part of the
dark-rift. The crosslike form of the Lamat glyph
recalls the Thieves' Cross of the Quiche story,
and the quincunx frog of the Chorti tale. The
mytho-astronomical location of this event needs
to occur on the ecliptic in order for Venus to
pass by; the southern terminus of the dark-rift
meets the ecliptic in Sagittarius. In sum, per¬
haps Venus-Quetzalcoatl was thought of as be¬
ing born from the cleft in the Milky Way? My
observations are supported by comments in
Milbrath (1988b). For a Lamat glyph on an
Olmec head where the cleft-head motif nor¬
mally is, see Reilly (1995:37).

an indirect acknowledgment of the three cos¬
mic centers of Izapan-Maya cosmovision: the
crossing-point of Milky Way and ecliptic in
Sagittarius (which targets the Galactic Center),
the zenith-as-center, and the polar center. All
of these centers are represented at Izapa, in its
monumental message and in the site's orien¬
tation to topographical features and sunrise po¬
sitions along the horizon (see Part IV: Izapa
Cosmos).
CHAPTER 15: THE MAN WHO WAS
SWALLOWED BY AN ALLIGATOR
1. Norman and Raxuleu (1976).
2. In Quiche, walking "beside" the ocean is writ¬
ten with the word ci:l, which means edge or
mouth. Thus, he walked by the "mouth" of the
ocean. The word for alligator is ayi:n.
3. In the same way that multiple layers of mean¬
ing are present in Maya folklore, multiple times
are alluded to by the storyteller's alternate use



EN D NOTES / 381
of past and present tense. The story ostensibly
occurred in the past but its internal dynamics,
which are the true point of the story, continue
to occur in the present.
4. The original translator feels this motif is "obvi¬
ously" due to "the influence of the story of Jonah
and the Whale." However, this seems overly
simplistic and nothing more is said.
5. Thus, in my revision of the translation, I retain
capital "F" in Father as in a title, like First Fa¬
ther.
6. Specifically, the Tzutujil. Martin Prechtel re¬
lated this information at a talk given in Boul¬
der, Colorado, in February 1993.
7. Jenkins (1992b); Jenkins (1994a). My study of
the Maya Venus Calendar showed that the
Quiche and Ixil Maya may have adopted a Ve¬
nus Calendar that changed the Sacred Day of
Venus from 1 Ahau to 1 Manik (Deer). Manik
was and is the primary year-bearer for the Ixil
and Quiche calendar-priests, and Manik rules
the sacred eastern mountain of Quijala (B. Ted
lock 1982:100), the direction of the heliacal rise
of Venus. According to my reconstruction, a
thirteen-day correction was implemented circa
a.d. 1246, thus bringing Lounsbury's November
18, 934 a.d. 1 Ahau 18 Kayab Sacred Day of Ve¬
nus into alignment with Calendar Round begin¬
nings (Lounsbury 1983), something not possible
in the Venus Calendar evident in the Dres-den
Codex. Thus, the Maya would have then accom¬
plished the synchronization of the Calendar
Round with the Venus Round, as well as the
vague Venus-Mars Round of 312 years.

10. As Claude Levi-Strauss wrote, to understand
the inner meaning of ancient legends, all po¬
etic variants must be considered. Our under¬
standing is enhanced when all the metaphors
used in various redactions are taken into ac¬
count. Another Popol Vuh variant, mixed with
Bible references, was recorded by Oliver La
Farge in the Kanhobal Maya town of Santa Eu¬
lalia in the 1930s (LaFarge 1947). In addition,
an unpublished Tzutujil version of the Quiche
Popol Vuh is called "Of The Sweatbath" (men¬
tioned in Carlsen and Prechtel 1988).

5. Gordon Wasson, despite discovering the psilo
cybe mushroom cult in Central Mexico, tire¬
lessly sought evidence for the ritual use of Ama¬
nita muscaiia, the Indo-European soma, in
Mesoamerica. There is some evidence that soma
was known in ancient Mesoamerica and was
used as an inebrient. For example, two terra¬
cotta figurines from Nayarit (in western Mexico)
were identified by Peter Furst and clearly re¬
semble Amanita muscaiia (Wasson et al.
1986:51). Linguistic evidence summarized by
Wasson (et al. 1986:47-53), based on the work
of Bernard Lowy (1971, 1974), suggests that
Amanita muscaiia was associated with Kakulja
Hunrakan, the Quiche Maya deity of thunder
and lightning strikes. (Mushrooms are tradition¬
ally associated with thunder and lightning
strikes, as they seem to magically spring up af¬
ter storms. Also, mushrooms have just one
"leg," recalling lightning.) Furthermore, Lowy
discovered evidence that the people of Chichi
castenango, Guatemala, recognized Amanita
muscaiia as a poisonous mushroom, to be
avoided. In a Tzutujil myth related by Martin
Prechtel, Lowy (in Wasson et al. 1986:48-49) also
found associations between the sacred tree, palo
de pita (coralbean tree), lightning strikes, the
Tzutujil Maximon cult-figure, and mushrooms.
6. Furst (1974a: 191). Based upon information sup¬
plied by Barbara Tedlock and Dennis Tedlock,
Furst (1974a: 191) relates that Stiophaiia cuben
sis, "or one that closely resembles it in form
and ecology," occurs plentifully in the Guate¬
malan highlands, where it was observed in the
Quiche region growing in the droppings of sheep
and goats. This confirms the likelihood that
psilocybin-containing species could thrive in
symbiotic relationship with ruminant animals
other than Old World cattle.
7. Furst (1974a: 193).
8. Eiythiina, the coralbean, is reported to be an

effective sedative, and contains the alkaloids
erysopine, erysovine, and hypaphorine (Orellana
1987:201-202). In Nahuatl it is called tzompa
mitl.

11.1 believe that a direct stimulation of the colon
may have given rise to visions of serpents; the
colon, wound up in a snake-like configuration,
being electrified by chemical stimulation,
would possibly give rise to serpentine visions.
Of course, this is a rather reductionistic inter¬
pretation, but serpent imagery in relation to vi¬
sion rites is quite prevalent in Classic Maya art.

2. McKenna and McKenna ([1975] 1993). Their
theory called Timewave Zero is based upon the
"novelty wave" encoded into the ancient Chi¬
nese I Ching. Terence McKenna decoded the
timewave and determined that the "zero point"
of the wave, which determines the manifesta¬
tion of the chaos attractor at the end of history,
will be the December solstice of a.d. 2012. My
research with the 2012 event emphasizes, based
upon its astronomical nature, that we can con¬
sider the Maya prophecy to be about an era of
transformation,- fifty years on either side of 2012
might apply. Ultimately, a one-hundred-year
period for a major shift in Earth's activities is
but a nanosecond in the larger seasons of our
planet's becoming.
3. Although the Milky Way had many mythic iden¬
tities, its role as the Cosmic Birther or Great
Mother emerges as the highest insight into its
essential nature. Perhaps the most compelling
words of support for this contention come from
Mesoamerican scholar Burr Cartwright Brun
dage, who wrote, "The Milky Way was itself the
body of that Great Mother out of whose tene¬
brous womb had once poured the sun and the
moon and the stars" (Brundage 1979:9). Many
scholarly sources provide the raw data for un¬
derstanding how the Milky Way and its dark
rift represent the Great Mother Goddess and her
birth canal. See, for example, Brady (1988);
Heyden (1975); Bassie-Sweet (1991:77); Laugh
lin (1975:132); P. Furst (1981:151), Matos Moc
tezufna (1995:32); and Brundage (1979:35-37).
Susan Milbrath (1988b) wrote about the Milky
Way's role as a fertile and female road or river of
stars and decoded the astronomical imagery in
the myth of Venus-Quetzalcoatl's birth. Based
upon Aztec sources, she saw Venus-Quetzalcoatl
being "born" during Venus's passage through the
Milky Way (near the dark-rift in Sagittarius). The
conception of the Hero Twins also occurred in
this same place, which I explored in Chapter
13. Milbrath concludes her study with these
words: "... one of the principal sky mothers
may be Citlalicue, the goddess of the Milky



END NOTES / 383
Way" (1988b: 164). The related Aztec Goddess
Citlalinicue (Star Skirt) is the Milky Way (Brisko
1993) and gave birth to the twins Quetzalcoatl
and Tezcatlipoca (Brundage 1979:35-37). There
are more examples, but the point is clear: Meso
american people understood that the Milky Way
was the Cosmic Mother. The reason I am em¬
phasizing this point is because its acceptance is
crucial to appreciating how the Maya thought
about the end-date alignment, which is an an¬
cient and fundamental mytho-astronomical
idea-complex in Mesoamerican cosmology. As
such, we can understand how the World Age
transformation in a.d. 2012 is to be a cosmic
insemination, and, ultimately, may result in the
birthing of a new form of life on Earth.

THE ANCIENT SKYWATCHERS
1. Burkitt (1924).
2. Thompson (1948); Proskouriakoff (1950).
3. Jakeman (1958:45-46). Subsequent researchers
feel that Jakeman's ideas are flawed because of
liberties taken with the reproduction of Stela 5.
For example, Indo-European beards appear in his
line drawings which seem to be Rorschach-like
apparitions.
4. Refer to Marion Stirling's comments in The
Olmec and Their Neighbors (1981).
5. Norman (1980:51) wrote that Stela 9 expresses
an ascent into heaven through its alignment on
Tajumulco volcano. This may be a secondary
chance alignment of Stela 8 over Stela 9 (Nor¬
man 1980:52), whereas the primary alignment
of Stela 9 is to the Tacana cleft in the north.
Norman observed that Stela 89, a later find from
the southeast corner of Group B, "depicts a man
gazing toward the [December] solstice sunrise
who appears to rise from his captive bands of
death with the rebirth of the sun" (1980:53). This
interpretation reinforces the idea of the Decem¬
ber solstice sunrise as a place of solar rebirth,
which is critical to understanding the relevance
of the end-date precession-caused alignment as
a World Age rebirth. However, I disagree with
Norman's idea that the captive is rising from,
or being freed from, his captive bands. More
likely, he is one of many sacrifices required for
facilitating solar rebirth (world renewal).

7. V. Garth Norman is one researcher who did in¬
clude these considerations from the start,
though I cannot agree with many of his identi¬
fications. A general assumption present in Nor¬
man's commentary (1976), affecting a lot of his
interpretations, is that the carvings are instruc¬
tive, priestly counsels toward afterlife fulfill¬
ment following a morally well-lived earthly ex¬
istence. As Lowe et al. (1982:315) point out, this
idea "runs counter to the prevailing interpreta¬
tions of Mesoamerican religion and pre-hispanic
world-view." Of course, this countering of con¬
ventional wisdom is not in itself lamentable; it
is the overshrouding influence of Old World
Middle Eastern religious ideas detectable in
Norman's analysis. While comparisons between
Old World and Izapan ideas can be argued, do¬
ing so does not help to identify the astronomi¬
cal content of Izapan monuments.

11. In the text of this book, I will use the term
"dialogue" for "dialectics." Isbell (1982) clari¬
fies the anthropological definition of the con¬
cept of dialectics. She proposes that the tropi¬
cal zone "provides a perceptual environment
that promotes and enhances a particular 'sci¬
ence of the concrete'" (353). By "science of the
concrete" she means that empirically per¬
ceived order in a given site's environment pro¬
vides the foundation for "systems of classifi¬
cations, epistemological structures, and cos¬
mologies" (353). Presumably the ambient
framework that informs local cosmo-concep
tion includes topography, seasonal cycles, and
astronomy. Having noticed the unique orien¬
tations1 properties of a specific location, hu



384 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
man beings may found a site for precisely these
reasons, and I believe this is what happened at
Izapa. According to Isbell, environmental de¬
terminants inform cosmo-conception within
the Tropics and lend themselves to ideas rooted
in "dialectical, reversible dualism" (353). Im¬
portantly, she notes that "native philosophers,
who are usually shamans or astronomer
priests, use methods and metaphorical lan¬
guage that are unfamiliar to us" (353). In other
words, the logic underlying native thought
systems is dialectical rather than rationalis¬
tic. Rational or linear thought processes are
limited by an either-or assumption that, in the
end, does not model nature very well. A com¬
plementary, oppositionally inclusive, or recip¬
rocal relationship between opposed categories
of experience more accurately reflects native
thought as revealed over many decades of eth¬
nographic study. For example, see B. Tedlock
(1982:2-5) and Jenkins (1994a:316-319).
Another concept related to this dialectical
approach is "conflation." In my usage here, this
means the purposeful mythologizing of dialec¬
tically opposed events so that they are under¬
stood as reflecting the same underlying unity.
Opposites are conceptually "conflated" into a
higher unity. We see this most clearly in the
identification of Mesoamerican deities. The
full moon is associated with the sun, being
called a "little sun." In another example, the
Underworld becomes the night sky when, af¬
ter sundown, it rotates above the horizon.
Here, the Underworld is actually above the
Earth, a concept strange to either-or thinkers
but perfectly compatible with the dialectical
mind-set. The categories of sky and Earth are
conflated into a higher unity in which, under
certain conditions, the sky is below the Earth
and the Underworld is above. Dennis Tedlock
(1985 and 1995) stresses that the Quiche word
cahuleu (sky-Earth) reveals a conflated concept
in which sky and Earth are unified into one
dialectical whole. This is a good example of
how conflation and dialectical thinking works.
And it can apply to extremely complicated lev¬
els of meaning, involving several levels of ob¬
servations, including both temporal and spa¬
tial categories. The unsung dimensions of
knowledge encoded in Izapan stelae provide a
great challenge of interpretation even when we
are armed with such a progressive dialectical
model.
For elucidation of dialectical thought,
Isbell refers to Wagner (1975), who states that
the anthropological usage of the concept of dia¬
lectics refers to "a tension or dialogue-like al¬
ternation between two conceptions or view¬
points that are simultaneously contradictory
and supportive of each other" (52). According
to Wagner, dialectical thought works by "ex¬
ploiting contradictions against a common
ground of similarity" (52). In comparison, "ra¬
tionalistic or 'linear' logic" (52) appeals to a
consistent meaning against a foundation of dif¬
ferences.

CHAPTER 20: IZAPAN CALENDRICS
1. See Malmstrom (1973). Malmstrom was not the
first to suggest that solar zenith-passage inter¬
vals at latitude 15°N might be responsible for



END NOTES / 385
the origin of the 260-day calendar. See Nuttall
(1928) and Apenes (1936). However, Malmstrom
(1978) further supported Izapa as the origin place
of the 260-day calendar by charting the chrono¬
logical evolution and geographical distribution
of Mesoamerican calendar systems and tracing
them back to Izapa.
2. For the range of zenith-passage days at the lati¬
tude of Izapa, see Appendix 3.
3. This was calculated with the 584283 correla¬
tion, what I call the True Count. See Jenkins
(1994a, 1996f).
4. The Tzotzil Maya of Chiapas (Vogt 1969:602)
have a solstice cosmogram concept, as do the
modern Tzutujil (Carlsen and Prechtel 1988). In
addition, the present-day Zoque of Santa Maria
Chimalapa believe that "the world is a square,
with its corners at the points where the sun rises
and sets at the solstices" (Munoz 1977:140).
Directional glyph blocks from a tomb at Rio
Azul confirm this conception for the Classic pe¬
riod (B. Tedlock 1992), as do the Uaxactun Group
E alignments. Brotherston and Ades (1975) origi¬
nally argued that the quadrated directional sym¬
bol of Mesoamerican cosmology conformed to
the two solstice axes and the zenith, a break¬
through supported by Watanabe (1983), Coggins
(1980) and others (e.g., Broda 1982b).
5. Using a 130-day interval, the moon passes
through four phase cycles with twelve days left
over. Two considerations allow us to extend this
another two days to reach the new-to-full mea¬
sure: 1) As mentioned, zenith observations can¬
not be made precisely to a day. At Izapa the range
is at least three days, allowing us to add one
and-one-half days to twelve. It is true that the
midpoint of the three-day range could have been
calculated, adjusting for the vagueness in zenith
passage observations, but we cannot be sure that
the Izapans were interested in this kind of ac¬
counting; they may have preferred to acknowl¬
edge the extreme limit of the three-day range.
2) Indigenous people (e.g., the Quiche) still mea¬
sure the moon from its first appearance in the
west as the new moon sliver, rather than from
"moon dark." As such, this shortens the mea¬
sure by one to two days, bringing us again to an
accurate one-half lunar phase cycle.
6. Edmonson (1988:246) cites a.d. 292 as the first
appearance of the Tikal calendar in the archaeo¬
logical record.
7. Edmonson (1986a and 1988).
8. Jenkins (1995a:Bk. 3, 15-16).
9. Martin Pickands wrote his Ph.D. thesis on the
Mesoamerican First Father legend. Pickands
(1978) provides some startling perspectives re¬
garding this ancient deity. He suggests that the
ancient First Father figure Huracan unites two
sub-aspects of himself, and is thus a kind of
triune deity. This resembles the polar and ze¬
nith concepts combined under the category
"north," both set in dialectical relationship to
the Galactic Center in the "south." Pickands
relates that the " Ahau cap" on certain deity fig¬
ures is a parentage glyph meaning "Our Father"
(129); we find this "Ahau cap"—a kind of in¬
verted boat—on Stela 11, further evidence that
the solar deity on Stela 11 is First Father.
10. My original argument is in Jenkins (1995a:Bk.
3, 16-19).

12. Malmstrom (1997:258).
CHAPTER 21: IZAPAN ASTRONOMY
AND COSMOLOGY
1. According to Lowe et al. (1982) and Norman
(1980), Izapa's main baseline, measured through
Group H (Mound 60 over Mound 25), is 21° east
of north. This points right at the peak of Tacana.
2. Norman (1980:51) states that the axis of Group
B, just to the east of Group H, points "one to
two degrees" further east. Looking at the pic¬
ture of Tacana, we see a shallow cleft on the
eastern flank, about 2° east of the peak. Thus, I
suggest that the reason for Group B's deviated
orientation is to emphasize this mythic cleft and
the rising of the Big Dipper that occurs there.
Similarly, the axis of Group A, which lies a short
distance west of Group H, is deviated some "one
to two degrees" west of the main 21° azimuth
baseline of Group H. This, I believe, refers to
astronomical events west of the peak—the fall¬
ing of the Big Dipper. The North Celestial Pole
is, of course, 21° west of Tacana peak, but the
Group A reference holds as a general indicator.



386 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
Significantly, stelae 4 and 2 on the main axis in
Group A depict the descent of the Seven Ma¬
caw bird deity, who is the Big Dipper (D. Tedlock
1985:330, 360).
3. Norman (1976:255-256).
4. Coggins (1982).
5. Coggins goes on to explore the northward ori¬
entation of Izapa to volcano Tacana. The oldest
Mesoamerican rituals involve volcanos and the
Old Fire Cod who lives inside them. This deity
is associated with incensarios and is symbolic
of the sun in the Underworld, at the nadir. Con¬
versely, the volcano's peak is symbolic of the
sun at zenith, in the exact center of the sky. At
Izapa, the zenith-passage dates are May 1 and
August 12 (with a three-day range of observa¬
tion for both). Tacana thus represents geographi¬
cal north, which orients the observer at Izapa
to the polar region around which the sky re¬
volves. Tacana also symbolizes the zenith,
which was the fifth, central, direction in the
Mesoamerican cosmogram bounded by the sol¬
stice axes.
6. Since Izapa is designed to mirror Tacana as the
axis mundi, it might be more primary to place
this 3-D grid over Tacana. When we do this the
north-south axis points north to the "birth of
corn" place near Cuilco, while the December

solstice axis points southeast to Tajumulco (see
note 8 below). Furthermore, the horizon east of
Tacana contains prominent peaks that corre¬
spond to the solstice and equinox sunrises, much
like the manmade arrangement of pyramids at
Uaxactun (Aveni and Hartung 1989). This com¬
pelling geographical fact explains why the an¬
cient Izapan cosmologists mythologized Tacana
as the navel of the cosmos.
7. See Freidel et al. (1993) and Scheie (1995b).
8. According to Tedlock (1993:2, 235), the location
of the semi-mythic origin place of corn is in the
western Guatemalan highlands north of Cuilco
and south of the Pan American highway. Te
osinte, the original undomesticated corn, still

yond the Tacana cleft on the 23° east-of-north
axis from Izapa. It is quite astounding that this
mythic origin place of corn lies directly on the
north-south axis that begins at Izapa and runs
through the Tacana cleft (see diagram).
This axis continues northward (roughly) to
Palenque (Coggins 1982). Since the cleft in
Tacana, as a reflection of the witznal deity and
the Olmec cleft head, is a symbolic emergence
place of the maize/sun deity, it seems beyond
coincidence that the Izapan axis points to the
same origin place indicated in the later Quiche
myths. Ultimately, this ley line is targeted on
the Big Dipper (Seven Macaw in the Popol Vuh).
9. Horizon rise azimuths in this diagram are: a)
Dubhe: 8.3°; b) Delta: 15.9°; c) Phecda: 20.3°; d)
Alkaid 27.1°.
10. Sunrise in the northeast opposes the Milky
Way dark-rift and crossroads setting in the
southwest. The Big Dipper rises with the sun
and thus is not visible at all during the night.
On sunset the reverse is true: the sun sets with
the Big Dipper in the northwest while the
dark-rift and crossroads rises in the southeast.
This suggests that around the December sol¬
stice, when the sun is weakest, struggling to
be reborn into the new year, the Big Dipper is
strongest, as Seven Macaw magnified himself
falsely in the Popol Vuh, impersonating the
sun. Conversely, around the June solstice the
sun is "strongest," thus banishing the tricky
Big Dipper from view. Echoed here is the cos¬
mological belief, as evidenced in the Popol
Vuh, that the polar area is a false center.
Around the June solstice (bisecting the two
zenith passages) the sun culminates overhead,
north of the zenith; in effect, it has invaded
the Big Dipper's realm of the north. In the same
way that the Big Dipper is visible all night
around the December solstice, the dark-rift
and crossroads of the Milky Way/ecliptic are
visible roughly all night long during the June
solstice.

12. See Hatch (1971).
13. Only circa 2600 b.c. did the North Celestial
Pole point to a star, but this is not relevant to
the point being made.
14. Rise azimuth data for the stars given in this
diagram are as follows. For a.d. 2000: a) 8.37°;
b) 17.31°; c) 20.31°; d) 15.89°; e) 17.81°; f) 19.73°;
g) 27.13°. For a.d. 11,400: a) 63.1°; b) 67.4°; g)
54.8°.
CHAPTER 22: THE MONUMENTAL
MESSAGE
1. Norman (1976:264) explained these as planetary,
moon, or star symbols. I think the best inter¬
pretation is that they are zenith gnomons, given
the symbolism of their associated Throne 1 and
Stela 9. Though crudely formed, they will indi¬
cate the zenith sun by casting no shadows at
high noon, observable over a range of three days
at the latitude of Izapa (see Appendix 3).
2. Because of its orientation northward to the
Tacana cleft, this glyph also may have a second¬
ary meaning of "north" (as in polar north). This
seems to be a statement of equivalence between
zenith and north that, as we explored earlier, is
a widespread Mesoamerican idea. As mentioned,
Group B's northward orientation is to the Tacana
cleft, the emergence place of the north. How¬
ever, the monuments of Group B seem to pri¬
marily address the zenith. Again, this seems to
indicate the conceptual synthesis of "polar
north" and "zenith."
3. Norman (1976:105) rejects the interpretation
that the lower part of Stela 8 depicts the legs of
a frog or toad, because of the "uniqueness" of
these legs. However, the feet on the toad carv¬
ing on Altar 1 and Stela 8 are very similar.
4. D. Tedlock (1985:330, 360).
5. Neither Lowe nor Norman concurs with Jake
man on the meaning of Stela 5, though Jakeman
is often quoted and Lowe speaks in places of "our
Canaanite model" (Lowe et al. 1982:272).
6. Scheie (1992b:152, 212); Kelley (1989:92).
7. Stela 1 seems to depict a rain invocation. Lift¬
ing the fish out of the southern ocean might
have invoked a sympathetic magic or ritual pro¬
cess through which the rains over Tacana to
the north were assured. The fish on Stela 1 also
are seen on Stela 5, and Stelae 67 and 22 in
Group F. Their "ringed" tails resemble the
breechcloth design on Stela 20 and elsewhere,



388 / MAYA COSMOGENESIS 2012
which in turn parallels the "bifurcated tongue"
symbol (Norman 1976:122). The breechcloth
design on the abstract Stela 20 is a symbol of
male power and rulership, and the Freudian
parallel between tongue and penis should not
go unmentioned, as it provides a rationale for
this symbolic parallel when we recall that, in
Maya ritual, blood was let through both the
penis and the tongue. The ring-tailed fish may
represent the self-sacrifice of the Hero Twins,
an event found in the Popol Vuh (they became
fish for five days) that serves as the necessary
precursor to their rebirth as celestial deities (the
sun and moon).
8. Robertson (1967).
9. M. Miller (1995).
10. The three-spot motif also reminds one of the
Ahau glyph as well as the "howl" phenomenon
mentioned earlier in relation to vision enemas.
In addition, it resembles the three-spot "solar
face" on the tail of the Ciotalus d. snake spe¬
cies, a key motif in the Zenith Cosmology re¬
constructed in Part DL

17. Cordy-Collins (1982) illustrates splay-legged fe¬
males from Ecuador in the so-called "hocker"
position of birthing and compares them to
Tlaltecuhtli and other Central Mexican Earth
Mother images. She postulates migration of
this symbol southward from Central Mexico
into South America circa a.d. 500. Several ab¬
stracted "ball and crescent" images from Ec¬
uador resemble the Izapan sky-clefts, especially
on Stela 88, which I propose is a male-female
symbol of fertilization, a symbol with a pri¬
mary astronomical reference at Izapa (the 13
baktun cycle end-date). In comparison, Cordy
Collins describes the Ecuadoran "ball and cres¬
cent" images as representing solely the Earth
Mother (1982:218). Also see Klein (1976a) and
Wilbert (1974).
18. Parsons (1986:142-143) provides a "sketch
map" of Kaminaljuyu. The majority of the ball
courts, some seven of them, are oriented to the
southeast horizon, about 4° south of the De¬
cember solstice azimuth. The remaining three
ballcourts at the site are perpendicular to this
orientation. Despite the slightly skewed ori¬
entation (and there may be inaccuracies in the
rough map used), one wonders if Kaminaljuyu
imitated the earlier ritual-astronomical orien¬
tation of Izapa. Similarly, scholars have pro¬
posed direct Izapan influence in the founding
of Copan (Aveni 1980). A detailed map of El
Baul shows a similar Izapan orientation of its
ballcourt.
19. Wren (1995).
20. Freidel et al. (1993).
21. Izapa Stelae 22 and 67 both depict similar ico¬
nography involving a boat, a solar hero, and
sky-ropes. The serrated edges on these depic¬
tions encircle the solar hero and are compa¬
rable to the "cosmic center" frame on the up¬
per portion of Stela 8 in Group B, as well as to
the serrated edge surrounding the crossband
on Throne 1 in Group B. The serrated enclo¬
sure on Stela 22 thus may represent an Under¬
world portal or denote a cosmic center. The
similarity between Stela 22 and Stela 67 sug¬
gests that the solar hero in "the middle" of
the Milky Way canoe is in a cosmic center.
22. Norman (1976:272).
23. Scheie (1992b, 1995b); Freidel et al. (1993).
24. This center-front position is comparable to the
center-front glyph on Throne 1, which we iden¬
tified as equivalent to the center or zenith di¬
rection in the cosmogram on Throne l's top
surface. This interpretation is reinforced by the
overall symbolism of the zenith in the sur¬
rounding Group B monuments.
25. Klein (1976a).
26. In Tzutujil Maya time philosophy, kexoj is a
concept of regeneration and renewal that op¬
erates on the collective spiritual level of hu¬
manity (see Jenkins 1994c).
27. Norman (1976:268).
28. As representative of the cosmic source and
womb of creation, a male ruler's sexual iden¬
tity is subsumed into his higher role as a birther
and conjurer, which are normally female func¬
tions. Today, Quiche diviners speak of having



END NOTES / 389
a "spirit wife," and the highest level of sha¬
man-priest daykeeper is a "mother-father."

9. Feuerstein et al. (1995) argue for the Indus River
Valley civilization as being the cradle of civili¬
zation some 7,000 years ago. Interestingly, they
see evidence for precessional knowledge and
that the churning of the milky ocean (the Milky
Way) was involved in Vedic cosmogenesis. See
also Wilson (1996:284-286).
10. As explored in my books Minor in the Sky
(1991) and Tzolkin: Visionary Perspectives and
Calendar Studies (1994), the 260-day tzolkin
is a sub-unit of the 26,000-year precessional
cycle. The former refers to individual physical
unfolding and the latter refers to collective
spiritual unfolding.
CHAPTER 25: BACK TO THE CENTER:
THE MEANING OF THE MAYA END
DATE
1. See Roylance (1997). Roylance reports astro¬
nomical calculations that show, allowing for a
margin of error, that the solstice meridian coin¬
cides most precisely with the Galactic equator
between February 1998 and November 1999.
However, precession is a very slow phenom¬
enon, and it is clear that the Maya intended the
2012 end-date to mark this event. Nevertheless,
the June solstices of 1998 and 1999 and the De¬
cember solstices of 1998 and 1999 would appear
to be critical turnabout points. We might con¬
sider ourselves to have "crossed the threshold"
by the December solstice of 1999. However, as
mentioned in the text, considering that the sun
itself is one-half a degree wide, the December
solstice sun will not completely clear the Ga¬
lactic equator until roughly a.d. 2018.

Reveals the secrets of the Maya’s galactic cosmology
hlle researching the 2012 end-date of the Maya calendar, John Major Jenkins
decoded the Maya’s galactic cosmology. JTne Mayajfiscovered that the
periodic alignment of the Sun with the center of the Milky Way galaxy is the formative
influence on human evolution. / jp

These alignments also define a series of world ages. The fourth age ends on December
21, 2012, when a large chapter in human history will come to an end. Maya
Cosmogenesis 2012 reveals the Maya’s insight into the cyclic nature of time, and
prepares us for our own cosmogenesis—the birth of gmew world.

The extensive research by John Major Jenkins infill the Mayan astronomy and myster¬
ies is very impressive indeed, and his book will no doubt become a classic in this field
of study. Maya Cosmogenesis 2012 is a must read for all those who feel that there is far
more to our past than meets the eye.” I

“In Maya Cosmogenesis 2012, author John Major Jenkins has combined his gift for
incisive mythic and symbolic interpretation with rigorous research, to reveal the
Mayan calendar as a world cosmology and spiritual philosophy, firmly grounded in
precise observations of celestial patterns and rhythms.”
-Robert Lawlor, author of Sacred Geometry
anti Voices ofthe. First Day
“Meticulously and exhaustively researched, carefully written, this hook’s patiently
arrived at (but never jumped to) highly original conclusions have both the weight and
the ring of authority found only in the best scholarship. Unlike other books devoted
to decoding the Mayan ‘prophecies’ it also has a potential happy ending.”
