The Early Hungarians
This volume shows to the En glish reader the origin of the Hun garians and their first civilization, — according to recent historical research. In the new light, the Hungari ans seem to have come from the Ancient Near East —Mesopota mia, Egypt and Syria —where the first Higher Civilization flourished. Their westward mov ing tribes reached the Middle Danube basin already in the Neo lithic times and had laid the foun dation of the future Hungary. In the subsequent periods Scythians, Huns and half-Turkised ArpadHungarians added their own eth nic and cultural contribution to the existing heritage, whereby the People acquired its final charac teristics by the end of the IXth century A.D. The volume (soft-bound, in-8°, 248 p., 36 ill.) can be ordered by mail, at the address of the Author: P.O. Box 697, Station “B”, Mon treal, Canada, H3B 3K3.

PROLOGUE
I'he rough road of Hungarian Ancient History
Hungarian Ancient History deals with that period of the national past which begins around 3000 B.C. and ends in 895 A.D. when the last Magyar ethnic wave arrived and settled in the C arpathian basin. This delim itation is mainly based upon a longstanding tradition, but is ju sti fied by methodological considerations as well. In deed, in the elaboration of ancient history, the so-called subsidiary studies of History play a con siderably greater role than in more recent periods, on account of the scarcity of written documents, which are the usual sources of historical knowledge. The most helpful of such subsidiary studies are, first, linguistics and archaelogy, then mythology and paleography, to which most re cently, the science of place-names or toponymy was added. This many-sided approach renders the task of the historians more difficult. The impor tance of their researches is however great, since the results have a strong bearing upon the national consciousness. Because of this. Ancient History is usually exposed to strong political interferences. 1. When modern historiography was born, in the middle of the X lX th century, Hungarian scholars found themselves before a difficult alternative: they had to adopt either the Finno-Ugrian con



ception of their past or the Orientalist conception. T h e foundation of the Finno-Ugrian or “Uralian” conception was laid down by Swedish, German and R ussian scholars, and in particular, by August Ludwig Schloezer, professor at Goettingen Uni versity, Germany. Its basic thesis was the linguistic a n d ethnic kinship of Hungarians with Finns and B sthonians living in the Baltic area, and with the U ralian peoples in the Volga-Ural region. The holder of this theory placed the original homeland of the Finno-Ugrians in the vast Siberian plain. T his theory was welcomed and strongly supported for political reasons by the Habsburg dynasty, which was anxious, after the tragic events of 1849, to curb Hungarian influence in the Double Mon archy just then, by injecting the leaders of that nation with an inferiority complex. They first sent Ivliklosits, the professor of slavistics a t Vienna University, to Budapest, to supervise the program of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Miklosits had understood the point of his mission and prepared a long list of words which were all “bor row ed” from the Slavonic languages, according to him. After Miklosits, a German scholar was sent to Budapest, J. Budenz (1836-1892), who became, with his companion Pal Hunfalvy (Hunsdorfer, lSlO-1891), the main architect of the Finno-Ugrian conception of H ungary’s ancient history. The two pioneers proclaimed th at the Hungari an people and the Hungarian language were of Finno-Ugrian origin, consequently, their original



( ommon homeland could not have been situated :mywhere else than in the Uralo-Siberian region. They also found th a t the early Hungarians stood, in respect to civilization, on the lowest step of evolution: they were forest-dwelling nomads, Hving on the mere product of N ature, eating mushrooms, berries, digging up roots, fishing and hunting. As such, they were ignorant of the funda mental achievements of Higher Civilization: stockbreeding and foodproduction by farming. In short, the early Hungarians were depicted as a backward populace, in a state of semi-savagery, whose later civilization developed entirely from constant borrowings, first from the Turkish peo ples, thereafter from Slavs, Germans and Latins, who were their teachers and instructors. The second conception of Hungarian ancient history linked the Hungarian language to the oldest one of mankind, viz. the Sumerian, and placed the original home of the Nation in the Ancient Near East, between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers (Sumer and Babylon). This concep tion was also first outlined by W estern scholars, namely by A.H. Sayce, J. Oppert, F. Lenorm ant and C. RawHnson. From a Hungarian point of view, the most im portant finding of the W est-European sumerologists was the discovery th at the Sumerian lan guage was neither Semitic nor Indo-European in structure, but agglutinative, like the Hungarian. The far-reaching significance of this statem ent was



obvious, because speakers of this early agglutina tive language were the authors of the first Higher Civihzation of mankind. A. H. Sayce summed up this thesis as follows: “The earliest civilized inhab itants of Babylonia did not speak a Semitic lan guage and therefore they were not Semites... Eas tward of Sumer, the type of language was thus agglutinative, as it was in Sumer itself. And in the days when civilization first grew up there, there is no sign or trace of the language we call inflection al... Babylonian culture owed its origin to a race whose type of language was th at of the Finns, of the Magyars or the Japanese” (P 112 pp. 70-72). The same opinion was upheld by all later sumerologists, including Prof. Woolley, who writes in the most recent UNESCO manual: “Sumerian was unique amongst the languages of the Ancient Near East in being agglutinative; it belonged in this respect, to the same group as... Finnish and Hungarian"(P 064 p. 635). W estern scholars also stated th at there was a steady outflow of Sumerian population towards Europe beginning the New Stone Age, and th a t they had introduced the Higher Civilization to almost all regions of Europe, including distant Britain. In short, this conception places Early Hungarians into a considerably higher historical status. After the above mentioned discoveries, it be came increasingly exciting for Hungarian scien tists to find out the true ethnic and linguistic identity of the ancient Near-Easterners: Mesopo



I iini.ins, Kgyptians, and Anatolians. It was indeed lm|)(‘(l (hat the solution of this enigma, with the li< l|) of the Hungarian clue, might lead us to a r,lul»;il re-evaluation of the origin and affiliation III all European peoples and, in particular, to a tccvaluation of the place of Hungarians amongst ilicin. A formidable challenge was thus awaiting Hungarian scholarship.
2. It seems incredible, but the fact is th a t H un garians were not encouraged to take part in these researches; on the contrary, they had been re moved from the field of sumerology and egyptology, and redirected towards the Uralo-Siberian wildernesses. The new Orientalist researches had already produced decisive results which were going to alter the traditional Semitic image of the region in question. In fact, they discovered th a t the m yth of the Creation, the story of the Flood, and the many hymns and parables recorded in the Old Testament, were not the literary invention of Semitic Genius, as it was believed until then, but that of the previous agglutinative-speaking peo ples, from whom they were simply taken over. Therefore, to avoid further erosion of the Semitic Miracle, it seemed appropriate to divert all the potentially dangerous elements from the field of researches. The chief instigator of this m ilitant policy was Joseph Halevy (1827-1917), a Jewishborn Rumanian, who managed to become profes sor at the Sorbonne in Paris. Actually, he had waged a lifelong battle to maintain the antiquated



belief, namely, emphasizing the exclusively Semi tic character of the Ancient Near East, where no other race was ever present, according to him. At the Orientalist Congress in Paris (1901), Hal6vy encountered H ungary’s delegate, Ignac Goldziher (1850-1921), who had a seat in the governing body of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and was, at the same time, general-manager of the Jewish Religious Community of Budapest for many years. So he was quick to understand Halevy’s concern and, back in Budapest, emphatically declared that Hungarian scholars were wasting their time searching for their ancestors in the Ancient Near-East, it being a purely Semitic area. And Bernat Munkacsy (Munk), another Hungarian educated orientalist, also member of the Academy of Sciences and school-inspector at the Jewish Religious Community of Budapest, submitted his “expert’s report” to the Academy, wherein de clared “in good faith” th at: “It is out of question... th a t we may envisage any closer relation between the Sumerian and the Hungarian languages. Therefore Hungarian scientists cannot rightly claim any part of the brilliant Sumerian heritage, nor can they take any credit from the Sumerians’ merits, under the pretext th at they were their ancestors. If anyone would, nevertheless, do so, he would make himself ridiculous” (P 051 p. 55). After that, the Academy systematically sabogated Sumerian studies in Hungary. It had refused to receive Zsofia Torma, the lady who wished to



report on her epoch-making finding, th a t in Neo lithic times there were close contacts between Hungary and ancient Mesopotamia. Professor Zsigmond Varga, another outstanding orientahst, who established several linguistic parallels be tween Hungarian and Sumerian in his imposing volume “At a distance of 5,000 years” (Debrecen 1942), was judged by his critics as an “impostor, charlatan, confused and unscientific.” A third scholar, Vilmos Hevesy (alias F.A. Uxbond), who discovered the ancient hnks between Hungarians and Indians (P 130), was also rejected, because his findings disagreed with the official Uralo-Siberian doctrine. Many other similar cases are known, but let us recall only one, th at of Florian Matyas. This scholar, in his inaugural address at the Academy (1859), talked, to no avail, about the deciphering of hieroglyphs; he was unable to capture the attention of Pal Hunfalvy, who simply laughed it off. It was not until a great, independent, inter national authority, Prof. G. Childe, stated in his fundamental work on the Danubian Neolithic and Bronze Ages (P 031), th a t scholars all over the world agreed th at the Early Hungarians had a respectable share in the heritage of the Ancient Near East. Thus ended the stormy, first period of the modern researches on the origin of Hungari ans, wherein the imposed Uralian conception seemed to prevail, to the detrim ent of the free researches.



3. After 1945 this situation totally changed, when swarms of intellectuals left Hungary, follow ing the communist take-over. These exiles, free of any political pressure, once they were settled in the free world, have undertaken the renewal of the ancient Hungarian history in an Oriental light. Ida Bobula (USA, 1900-1981) was the first to perceive their new mission. She took up research where Prof. Varga left off in 1942 and was indefat igable in arousing interest for the arduous task. In his time, Prof. Varga was mainly dealing with grammatical parallels between Sumerian and Hungarian. As regards the vocabulary, however, he was unable to find more than about 80 common words. Consequently, Ida Bobula, focussed her efforts upon the enlargement of the vocabulary concordances and was instrum ental in completing the existing list with over a thousand additional common words, amongst them the im portant one for ‘God’, Isten in both languages. W ith her work, she firmly established the Sumero-Hungarian kin ship as a scientifically proven fact and summed up her results in an English language study, Su merian affiliations (P 014).
Other exiled Hungarian scholars followed the trend as set forth by Ida Bobula, elucidating a surprisingly high number of common charac teristics of the Sumerian and Hungarian lan guages. Amongst them, we have first to mention Ferenc Badiny Jos (Argentina), professor of sumerology a t the University of Buenos Aires, who



Iril'd to fill the considerable time-gap between the nul of Sumer in the Near East and the birth of Ilungary proper in Europe, by means of a Hungar ian language book, “From Chaldea to Ister-Gam” (F 006). The late Victor Padanyi (Australia) con centrated his attention upon the migrating H un garians in the Don region (P 101) and C. G. Gostony (France) produced an etymological dictionary of Sumerian (P 056), while Sandor Csoke (Austria) compiled a “Sumero-Hungarian gram m ar” (P 015). Finally, the comprehensive work of Sandor Nagy which was written in En glish, deserves special mention, The forgotten cradle o f the H ungarian culture (P 098). All these works concerned Sumer (Southern Mesopotamia) only and m aintained th a t Hungarian is the direct continuation of the ancient Mesopotamian lan guage, as it was spoken in the H lrd millenium B.C., or, as Sandor Csoke expressed it: “W ith a few phonetical and grammatical differences, the Sumerian folklanguage, i.e. the spoken language was, on the whole, the same as present-day H un garian.” The next most im portant step in the elaboration of the orientalist conception was the extension of the field of investigation beyond Mesopotamia, to cover the whole Near-East. It was indeed discov ered th at innumerable Magyar words were used, not only in Mesopotamia, but elsewhere too, in the B.C. times, especially in the Nile valley, as well as in Syria and in Anatolia. In these areas



certain texts written with hieroglyphs or with Phoenician-type characters, can be read in H un garian. These surprising results definitely proved th at the original home of the Hungarian speaking population was the entire Near-East and also that Magyar was a primary language, from which many others originated. The enlargement of the field of investigations and the above mentioned decipher ings are due to Prof. Tibor Barath, author of this book, whose three volumes —Ancient History of the H ungarian speaking Peoples” (P 007) — are fundam ental in this regard. T hat ancient Egypt had been the most brilliant Magyar homeland, was first stated by F. Thomas in his Latin study: Conjecturae de origine, prim a sede et lingua Hungarorum (Buda 1806). It m ust also be added th at the eminent Finnish linguist, Helmi Poukka (Helsinki), has made an im portant contribution to the subject with her “HungarianFinn-Egyptian word-parallels” (P 105). In her publication, she lists 1,045 identical Egypto-Hungarian words. This work was recently expanded into an im portant m anuscrit of 307 pages, which its author has generously forwarded to the writer of these lines.
A ll these studies made almost exclusively by exiled Hungarian scholars resulted in the elabo ration of a new Hungarian ancient history, whose starting point is in A ncient Near East, in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages.



I In the light of these researches, the basic iIm '.i s oI the Finno-Ugrian historical conception l>r. iiiin' more and more untenable; above all the ImIh I (hat Hungarian was a language of FinnoI origin. This m ust be a misnomer, declared Ilie orientalists, in view of the fact th a t the llim^iarian vocabulary includes a mere 7.3% of «nmmon Finno-Ugrian words, against 92.7% nonI'lmio-Ugrian. Moreover, if Old Hungarian ante(l.iU's the Indo-European languages, how it could liave borrowed words from them, when they were not yet in existence? Considering th a t the Hun^;arian and Indo-European common words are embedded in the oldest layer of the latters’ vocab ulary, the presumption is strong th a t these com mon words were borrowed by the Indo-Europeans from the Old Hungarian. And again, since the emergence of the Hungarians took place in the Ancient Near-East, it seems impossible th at the people would have originated in Uralo-Siberia. The tiny Vogul (Manysi) and Ostiak (Hanti) peo ples — 9,000 and 21,000 souls respectively — who are now living in Siberia, cannot vouch for the Northern origin of Hungarians, because anthro pologically they are the farthest removed from them. These fragments of an original Uralian population were, in all probability, overrun by a breake-away branch of H ungarians (cf. P 059 pp. 173-179), who taught them a few hundred words before being assimilated. This view is sup ported by the Vogul name, which is probably an



old form of the present Hungarian Fogoly, m ean ing ‘Captive’. In any case, the Finno-Ugrian theory of history never succeeded in proving its point to the general satisfaction. Large segments of the academic world — linguists, historians archae ologists in particular — remained skeptical and discussed it with great reservations. For all these reasons, those of the opposite conception openly rejected it as an obsolete theory. The pressure against the Uralian conception increased so heavily in the last ten to fifteen years, th at the holders of this antiquated belief felt themselves cornered, and began a desperate fight for survival. But, instead of discussing and refuting the pretensions of the orientalists, they simply declared that the theses of their adversaries are unacceptable, ‘because’ they are contrary to the official doctrine. They soon lost their tempers and started a vilipending campaign. They everywhere proclaimed th at the exiled historians “have been infected with a Western virus”, and th at they suffer from “spiritual inebriety”, for whom the “Oriental mirage” (sumerology and egyptology) is but a “therapeutic gymnastic”. They also labeled the orientalists “fanatics, lunatics, chauvinists, and fascists” (P 008). The Finno-Ugrists also used administrative measures to silence their oppo nents, especially the so-called press-closure, which means th at the scientific promotion of the orien talist conception is banned from the media in Hungary. Since then in th at country, the periodi



cals, newspapers, publishing houses, television and radii) stations were exclusively reserved for schol ars with Finno-Ugrian mentality. Along with the pnss-c'losure, writers in line with the official dofiina were encouraged to prepare fresh publica tions in the obsolete spirit, saying nothing about thi“ 1‘xistence of the other way of thinking. It would nevertheless be a mistake to think th a t the front of Finno-Ugrists is a solidly united one. As a m atter of fact, there are, in Hungary itself, many scholars who already have assimilated sev eral im portant elements of the Hungarian re searches abroad. Antal Bartha, for example, has discarded the wrong belief th at the early Hungari ans had been forest dweller nomads. Instead, he teaches today th a t they were living in river valleys, engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry, and stood, in every respect, upon the level of contem porary Higher CiviHzation. He also m aintains th at the early Hungarians had come to the KamaVolga “meeting place” (no longer “cradle land”), in successive waves, from a southerly direction, at the beginning of the first millenium B.C., starting from the area “where the food-production first had taken place,” i.e. from the N ear-East (M agyar Hirlap, December 15, 1972). Further more, anthropologist Tibor T oth has conceded th at the skeletons do not support the existence of any early Hungarian settlem ent in the UralSiberian region. On the contrary, they clearly



prove th at it actually was in the Aral Sea region (Kisalfald, June 16, 1972). This will suffice to m ark out the place of the orientalist conception in the general Hungarian historical researches during the last hundred and fifty years or so. A fter a difficult start, it seems now to be closer to victory. In the following chapters, the author lets the reader become ac quainted, in detail, with the orientalist conception only, avoiding all controversies.



PART ONE
WHO ARE THE HUNGARIANS?



THE PEOPLE
1. The anthropological build-up of the Nation
Reliable data concerning the anthropological structure of European peoples, can be found in the standard work of the Swiss anthropologist Eugene P ittard (P 103) and in the historical racegeography of the Soviet scientist V. P. Aleksejev (P 002). Inform ation concerning specifically the Hungarians is available in the brief accounts of Mr. Kosonczi {Sorsunk, Australia, 1959-1960), and in the two more recent articles by Pal Liptak (P 090) and Tibor T oth (P 128), leading anthro pologists in Hungary to-day. According to the authorities mentioned, the various peoples of Europe intermingled so much during the last two or three millenia th at today they hardly differ from one another genetically. By and large, they are made up almost everywhere with the same racial elements, viz. the white skinned Caucasoids or Aryans; ‘ the brownish
1. We have reverted to the Aryan term, following the practice of many scientists, who prefer it because its meaning is ‘Men’ (Wiro, Vir, Ar, Ur) in most of the European languages (cf. P 130 p. 115).



complexioned M editerraneans or Touranians, also called Kush; and a third element, especially detec table in Scandinavia and in Spain. The latter are probably the descendants of a pre-Neolithic popu lation called Cro-Magnon-men. W ithin the said relatively uniform social structure, the individu ality of each people is only characterized by the differing proportion of the common composing elements. In the case of Hungarians, the specific ratio is said to be c. 80 —85% Caucasoids or Aryans and c. 15-20% Touranids or Kush. The repre sentation of the Nordic (Cro-Magnon) type in Hungary is so m inute th a t it is practically negli gible.' The great majority of Hungarians (the Cauca soids) is characterized by a height of 167 cm, a clear complexion, variable eye colour (40% fair and 40% dark) and medium brown hair. T heir face and eyes are of a vivid tone, their nose is straight, but sometimes high and bridged. Their general de m eanour is a friendly one. According to cranial measurements, their average cephalic index (Cl) is 84.3, i.e. they belong to the short-headed racial group.-^
2. The double racial origin of the Hungarians is first mentioned in the Latin language work of the sharp-eyed historian Deseritzky who said; “Hunnos Magoresque gentem robustissimam et populosissimam partim ex Japhet per Magog, partim ex Cham per Chus turn vero Nemrothum fuisse propagatam et in unum coaluisse” (P 092 p. 79).



E. P ittard was surprised to find, in a strongly mixed Europe, a relatively homogeneous popula tion, especially in Central Europe, which was overrun so many times by foreign invaders since Neolithic times. B ut he himself gives us the neces sary explanation, emphasizing the fact th at before the arrival of the last huge Hungarian ethnic wave in A.D. 895, the numerically most im portant eth nic body in the country —the Avars —was racially akin to the Magyars: they resembled each other like “two overflows of a single and same ethnic lake”, to quote the words of E. Pittard.^ His evalu ation holds good even for the periods prior to the Avars, including Neolithic times. In fact, the near ly 1,000 extant crania from this age prove th a t even the earliest settlers of the Land, almost exclusively consisted of short-headed Caucasoids (P 103 p. 36). This means th a t the same hum an race has perpetuated itself in Hungary from the earliest historical times in an uninterrupted conti nuity.
3. The head-shape is indicated by the cephalic index (Cl). It is given in percentage ratio (100) with the skull-width (W) and its greatest length (L), from front to back, seen from above the head: C I= 1()0 X (W:L). When its Cl is 80.00 or more, the cranium is round, short or brachycephalic. When Cl is 75.00 or less, the cranium is long or dolychocephalic. Between these two ranges are the meso-cephalic or medium-headed elements. 4. E. Pittard: «I1 me semble de plus en plus evident que les invasions avares et magyares, qui apparaissent de beaucoup comme les plus importantes, ne sont que deux



According to anthropologists, the greatest con centration of the shortheaded population is to be found in the Caucasus region."’ The farther one moves away from the area, the thinner is the density of the brachycephalic element. On this basis it was assumed, th a t the oldest detectable home of this race was in the Caucasus region, whence they got their scientific denomination: Caucasoid race. From their supposed original ho meland, the Caucasoids or Aryans are said to have slowly moved southwards, extending their control over the whole northern part of Ancient Near-East already in prehistoric times. They were harbringers of the so-called Higher Civilization, in which most people were farmers living in small villages. The second racial element of the Hungarian ethnic body is the Kushitic one. Their distinctive anthropological characteristics were the darkish skin colour and the Caucasian (not African) face.**
detachements sortis d’une meme masse unique; que deux ^missaires issus d’un meme lac ethnique* (P 103 p. 341). 5. E. Pittard noticed the strong concentration of short headed Aryans in the Ancient Near-East. He said: “En Asie, par exemple, parmi les peuples divers que Ton a appel^ les Aryens, et qui ont laiss^ le souvenir de grandes civilisations, il y a beaucoup de brachyc^phales, d’Aryen brachyc^phales” (P 103 p. 29). 6. It is important to keep in mind that, when our historical sources mention the “dark” complexion of Kush, they do not always use this word in a literal sense as ‘black’, but rather as opposed to white. — Further, the Kush



In contrast to the Aryan agriculturists, the Kush were mainly a stock-breeding population and as such moved around extensively. For a long time, they lived in tribal communities, without any higher socio-political organisation. They desintegrated easily and many of them became absorbed into the ethnic bodies of other nations, most often in subject status, so th a t they soon lost their own ethnic identity through assimilation. Amongst the written references to the existence of white and dark men in Hungary, the most explicit one is th a t of Adamar of Angouleme, author of Historia Francorum (X lth century). He described a monk’s journey through Hungary and claimed th at two distinct races existed there: a white one in Ungaria Alba and a dark one in Ungaria Nigra, so called after the skin colour of their inhabitants." Hungaro-Kush relations were.
must not be confused with Negroes, who are either a distinct race, or a product of the jungle. Schure insists upon this and says: «I1 faut en chercher le type sup^rieur non pas dans le Negre degenere, mais dans I’Abyssinien et le Nubien, en qui se conserve le moule de cette race parvenue a son apog^e» (P 114 p. 42).
7. In the first millenium A.D., almost every Eastem-European nation had some brownish-darkish complexioned ethnic elements in their physical make-up. There were white and dark Huns, white and dark Bulgars, white and dark Ugors, white and dark Chasars. It is surprising that this all-important historical fact escaped the atten tion of scientists, who persisted in believing that the adjectives White and Dark, when employed in historical



however, almost always somewhat strained be cause of the lower cultural niveau of the dark men.” And when the Kush refused to become Christians, King Saint Stephen (1000-1038) dispersed them all over the country, where they lost their individual identity. Author Adamar of Angouleme writes in th a t connection the following commentary: “King St. Stephen of Hungary a t tacked black Hungary with the army and convert ed the whole country to the true faith, partly by sheer force, partly by intim idation and affection.”*’
sources, in connection with ethnic names, would signify the basic points: East and West, i.e. the geographic position of the respective peoples. This is, of course, a misin terpretation.
8. Chronicler Simon de Keza accurately reflects the general feeling of Hungarians against the dark coloured popula tion by saying: “Gentes siquidem in eadem (i.e. in Scythia) procreate otia complectuntur, vanitatibus dedite, nature dedignantis actibus venereis intendentes, rapinas amant, generaliter colore plus nigre quam albe” (P 120 I p. 252). 9. Former linguists and historians were inclined to consider the Kush population as of Old Turkish extraction. It was, however, impossible to find a fitting Turkish branch, or to determine the specific geographic area where contacts between Hungarians and Turks might have taken place. Above all, the beginning of the KushHungarian relations antedates the existence of any Turkish people. Therefore, the idea of early TurkishHungarian connections had to be abandoned (see Prof. Mcnko in P 009 p. 50).



The anthropological build-up of Hungarians links them to most of the European peoples, e. g. to the French, so far as they are of GalUc descent, and to the English as well, so far as they are Britons, Scots and Piets. On the other hand, Hungarians have genetic connections with the old Oriental nations (Sumerians, ancient Egyptians, Indians), and also with the youngest offsprings of the said great family: Scythians, Huns, Avars in particular. The kinship of Hungarians is large both in Europe and in South West Asia, and this circumstance explains why Hungarian ancient history is, in m any respects, one o f the most im portant keys to the general history o f Eurasia.



2. The Hungarian language and its great antiquity
A language is characterized by its gram m atical structure, vocabulary and phonetics. When these characteristics are compared with those of other languages, it can be established which languages are cognate, i.e. have a common origin. The cog nate languages form language-families and have such names as Indo-European, Finno-Ugrian, U ralaltaic and so forth.
1. The principal characteristic o f the H ungari an gram m atical structure is th a t the root of the verb remains the same throughout the different variations (conjugations) and to this unchanging root the various particles are added, called suffixes, to express tense relations, modes and personal cases. The pattern is always the same: stem -Icircumstantial suffixes + case ending. In the fol lowing two words: To give and To write, the basic roots are AD and IR. The root, in itself, expresses the indicative present, therefore the personal case ending comes next here, thus: AD-ok, IR-ok: I give, I write. Secondly, the root, when enlarged with the conditional suffix N becomes AD-N-6k, IR-N-6k: I would give, I would write. Thirdly, when inserting the subjunctive suffix J, the follow ing forms emerge: AD-J-ak, IR-J-ak: T h at I give, T hat I write. Fourthly, the sign of the past being r. ili(‘ two verbs in question take the following



forms: AD-T-am, IR-T-am, I gave, I wrote. The declension of the noun follows the pattern of the conjugation. There too, the various endings are affixed to the unvariable root, the nominative case excepted, which is the root itself, w ithout a suffix. So the noun HAZ ‘House’ becomes, with the plural suffix K, HAZ-ak; with a second suffix BAN m ean ing ‘In ’, we say HAZ-ak-ban, In houses. All the elements of the word thus formed are written without a hyphen, and merged into a single block: Adtam , Irtam, H dzakban, etc. Due to its compact character, Hungarian is called a synthetic lan guage, or, owing to the numerous suffixes it uses, a suffix-using (suffixed) or agglutinative language. Two other features of the Hungarian grammar are, first of all, th at it has no gender. So IR may mean ‘She or He writes’, depending on the context. Secondly, it has a fully developed unvaried definite article, used in two forms: ‘A’ or ‘AZ’. ‘A’ stands before nouns beginning with a consonant, while ‘AZ’ is employed before nouns beginning with a vowels. So we say: A HAZ ‘The house’, but AZ EG ‘The sky’.
2. H ungarian has a comparatively large vocab ulary, thanks to its great antiquity, and also to the ease with which new words can be made. Forty words which will frequently appear in the forth coming chapters are listed below. They belong to the oldest layer of the vocabulary and, as such, they are mostly monosyllabic. Words denoting parts o f the hum an body: 1. KEZ ‘H and’; 2. KAR



‘Arm’; 3. SZEM ‘Eye’. W ords for house and its equipment: 4. HAZ ‘House’; 5. HON ‘Dwelling’ or ‘Land’: 6. TANY ER ‘Plate, Disk’; 7. FAZEK ‘(cooking) P o t’; 8. SZEK ‘Chair’; 9. AGY ‘Bed’. The environment: 10. EG ‘Sky’; 11. FOLD ‘E arth, Ground’; 12. NAP ‘S un’ and ‘D ay’; 13. VIZ ‘W ater’; 14. UT ‘R oad’; 15. MEZO ‘Field’; 16. K E R T ‘G arden’; 17. Ft) ‘Grass’. Food: 18. MEZ ‘Honey’; 19. ITAL ‘D rink’; 20. SOR ‘Beer-’. A n i mals: 21. HAL ‘Fish’; 22. MADAR ‘Bird’; 23. EG ER ‘Mouse’; 24. KOS ‘R am ’; 25. CSIRKE ‘Chicken’; 26. BEKA ‘Frog’. Implements: 27. KES ‘Knife’; 28. HAJO ‘B oat’; 29. SZEK ER ‘C art’; 30. K E R E K ‘Wheel’. Religion: 31. UR ‘Lord’; 32. IST E N ‘God’; 33. K E P ‘Image’; 34. MAS(A) ‘Copy of, D eputy’; 35. PAP ‘Priest’; 36. TUDO ‘Magician, Scientist’. Numbers: 37. K ETTO ‘Two’; 38. OT ‘Five’; 39. H E T ‘Seven’; 40. SZAZ ‘H undred’. How are compound words formed? The simplest way consists of putting the respective stems to gether, the determining word being placed before its dependent as a rule. Examples: Fut + Ar = F utar ‘Messenger’ (ht. Running m an); Hord + Ar = H ordar ‘P orter’ (lit. Carrying man); Nagy + Ur = N ador ‘Governor, D eputy King’ (lit. Great man). In compound words only the last part takes up suffixes and case-endings, the compound being considered as a single word. In addition to the above mentioned process called nominal com position, Hungarian has another method to build new words with new shades of meaning. It consists



of adding derivative suffixes to the root in the case of nouns, and placing prefixes before verbs. The derivative suffixes are very numerous, e. g. —sag (seg) which imphes the idea o f ‘m ultitude’. Its first form (-sag) fits to roots ending with a back vowel, while the latter fits to those ending with a front vowel, as in KATONA-sag and PEK-seg: ‘Army’ (lit. Soldier -I- m ultitude) and ‘B akery’ (lit. Baker + multitude), respectively. In the case of verbs, the most im portant prefixed particles are the directional ones, like In, Out, Up, Down, Forward, Backward, Under, Away, Retour, etc., which are in Hungarian: Be-, Ki-, Fel-, Le-, Elore-, H atra-, Ala-, E1-, Melle-, Vissza-.
3. The phonetical structure o f H ungarian is largely influenced by stress, which always falls on the first syllable of the word which is uttered with greater emphasis than the others. Now, when the tongue has taken up the necessary position to form a certain accentuated syllable, it is easier to remain in the same position when uttering the subsequent ones. The consequence of this laziness of the tongue is a sound-preference, called vowel har mony. It means th at whenever the first syllable includes a back vowel (A, 0 , U), the following vowels must usually be of the same category. The same applies to the front vowels (E, I), m utatis mutandis. T he sound-preference goes so far as to influence even the simplest suffixes, which have two forms: the one fitting to roots with deep tonality (A, O,



U), the other to those with high tonality (E, I). The two forms of the suffix ‘In ’ are BAN and BEN, and we say FAL-ban ‘In wall’ and K ERT-ben ‘In garden’. The law of vowel harmony also governs the formation of compounds and mercilessly brings all the vowels into the general tone of the first, stressed syllable. T he result is a completely new word, in which the composing elements are sometimes hardly detectable. For example, a great city on the Hungarian Plain got its name from the fusion of two words, Kecske (goat) and M at (pasture), and is today called Kecskemet. In the archaic period, the majority of nouns ended with a vowel. However, with the consolidation of the word-stress on the first syllable, the sound of the final vowel became weaker, and was eventually silenced. W ith the loss of the final vowel, the preceding one was usually lengthened as in the following examples: Old Hungarian Uru became I >; Sassu became Szdz, and B harata > Bardt. In Old Hungarian there was a marked prefer ence for deeper vowels as opposed present usage. Instead of the present ‘A’, ‘0 ’ was used; and instead of ‘O’, ‘U’. So the present word for ‘D ust’, Por appears in older texts as Pur\ the word for ‘Fatherland, C ountry’ Hon appears as Hun\ ‘R am ’ which is today Kos, was then Kus (pron. Kush); and Magyar, the native name for Hungarian, formerly was Mogur\ while the word for ‘Beer’Sor, was Sura.
In the process of softening the system of conso



nants, the ‘P ’, ‘T ’ and ‘K ’ sounds often changed into voiced sounds: ‘B ’, ‘D ’ and ‘G’ respectively. The phenomenon of m utation of sounds is known in hnguistics as sound-shift. Under its impact, almost all Old Hungarian words beginning with a ‘P ’ sound, changed to ‘F ’. Examples: Old H un garian P al meaning ‘W all’ became Fal; Palu ‘Vil lage’became Falu\ Patek > Fazek ‘(cooking) P o t’; Pekete > Fekete ‘D ark’; Penu > Feny6 ‘Pine’; and Pono > Fond ‘Spinner’. In spite of the quasi regularity of the frontal P > F change, certain ossified words continue to be used in their archaic forms, such as Paller ‘C ontactor’, a compound of Fal + Ur, lit. ‘Wall M an’; and Puszta ‘Steppe’ (in Eastern Europe) which is the compound Fiis + Ta, lit. ‘Herbaceous land’. The softening of the Hungarian sound-system had a second phase around C hrist’s birth, which enriched the language with seven new voiced sounds, w ritten today with double-lettered signs. These are 1. CS, which sounds like ch in ‘Cherry’; 2. GY as d in French ‘Dieu’; 3. LY as / in ‘Volume’; 4. NY as n in ‘New’; 5. SZ as s in ‘Science’; 6. TY as t in ‘Tuesday’; and 7. ZS like s in ‘Pleasure’. For all these new sounds (exactly as for B, D and G sounds) there never was any special graphic sign in the Old Hungarian writing, because its origin antedates the soundshift.

Now, if we imagine the Hungarian language in its archaic from, i.e. w ithout voiced consonants, without diacritical signs, and with deeper tonality, and a vowel at the end of nouns, we will be surprised to see how closely such a script resembles the alphabetic transcript of certain Near Eastern languages of the Ilird and Ilnd milleniums B.C. Actually, with the Old Hungarian phonetic key, it would be possible to understand certain hiero glyphic texts and inscriptions written with the Phoenician type of letters. The following specimen shows w hat H ungarian looked like around 1200 A.D., two hundred years after the conversion to Chzistianity and the adoption of the Latin alpha bet. The following two sentences are taken from the Funeral Pryer, which starts thus: LATIATUC FELEIM ZUMTUCHEL MIC VOGMUC. YSA PUR ES CHOMUV VOGMUC. Using the present orthography, this text would be: Latjatok feleim szem etekkel mik vagyunk. Izzo por es hamu vagyunk. Translated into English in the original sequence of the words and suffixes, it would be: ‘See-you/brethren-m y/eyes-your-w ith/w hat/arewe/. G lowing/dust/and/ash/are-we/. In this short sample, all the essential elements of the language are already in their final places and even the suffixes are solidly “glued” to their respective root-words. It should also be mentioned th at this fill i. xi is <omprehensible to every H ungarian of



loday at first hearing, so little has the language 1 hanged in the lapse of eight hundred years, while (he changes, witnessed by other European lan^Hiages during the same period of time are, howev(>f. very considerable. So we have to keep in m ind that the tempo of the Hungarian linguistic change is and has always been very slow.
We have a significant assessment of the general build-up and inner structure of Hungarian by an eminent English scholar. Sir John Browning (1792-1872) who had a good command of th at language and had translated numerous poems. He expressed his admiration for its unity, originality and exceptionally strong cohesion. He likened it to an Egyptian stone monument hewn out from a single block of granite and upon which not the thinnest fissure is detectable. Its origin dates back to the times when none of the presently spoken languages of Europe were yet in existence. “This language is the oldest and most glorious m onu ment of national sovereignty and mental indepen dence.” 4. Now, the im portant question is to know to which fam ily of languages Hungarian belongs and what position it occupies within its group, accord ing to the newest researches. If Hungarian cannot be classified as a Finno-Ugrian language, nor as a Turkish one, we have to examine the third alternative, its connections with the family of Indo-European languages, th a t is, we have to look whether Hungarian has connections with the



Greek, Latin, German, English and Slavonic lan guages in Europe (the “Kentum ” group of the Indo-European) on the one hand, and with the Hindu, Sanscrit, Sumerian and ancient Egyptian in Asia and Africa (the “Satem ” group of Indo-Eu ropean) on the other. Actually, Hungarian has been compared with all these languages. The most detailed comparison with Greek was carried out by Jozsef Aczel (1927). According to him, Greek and Hungarian have over two thousand words in common, in addition to the great number of Greek place-names, having a definite Hungarian meaning. A closer analysis has disclosed, however, th a t the common Hungarian-Greek words are to be found mostly in Old Greek, i.e. in the pre-Greek languages: Pelasgian, Cretan and Aegean. —The comparison with Latin disclosed th a t its gram m atical structure is, in many respects, similar to that of Hungarian. Latin is also an agglutinative tongue, using a great num ber of affixes, both in declensions and conju gations. Moreover, its vocabulary has many words th a t are in common with H ungarian (11.5%), according to Gy. H ary’s word-statistics. The most extensive research in this regard has been done by Prof. Laszlo Szabedy (1974). T he fact th a t several inscriptions, written in the pre-Latin E tru scan language, were read in Hungarian by this author, suggests th at the Hungarian words in •Hicslion must have found their way into Latin Ilii ui^;li t lu* intermediary of Etruscan, an Oriental



language from Asia Minor, and th a t these words are now embedded in the lowest and oldest stage of Latin, which is similar to the H ungarian words in old Greek. The number of common Germano-Hungarian words accounts for 6.1% of the H ungarian vocabu lary. We know little about the common English words, as no research has been made yet in this particular field. T heir number might be, however, quite significant, proof of which are several hundred Old British place-names (cf. P 108) that, in essence, are Hungarian. The British scholar L. A. W addell has found enough evidence (see P 132) to prove that the early Brit-Honi population ori ginated from the Ancient Near-East, together with the very name of Brit, Prit which sounded origi nally like B arat, and had the meaning of ‘Com panion, Fellow-Traveller, Associate’, exactly as in the Hungarian language of today. A particular British fellow-traveller ethnic group of the Bronze Age, was the Picti, whose name is unexplainable in English, but clear in Hungarian. Picti would be pronounced today, after the P > F change, as Fekete, meaning ‘dark coloured’. We really know from authentic historical sources th at the Picti were a dark skinned people. —The greatest number of French-Hungarian common words are to be found in Gallic place- and ethnic names, preserved in Caesar’s famous report, De bello Gallico (P 030). B ut amongst the present French place-names there are also a great number of



H ungarian words, proof of which is the Directory of the French communes (P 039 bis). The Slavonic languages also have a considerable number of common words resembling Hungarian. Their proportion am ounts to 13.5% of the H ungar ian vocabulary, according to the above-mentioned word-statistics. It is im portant to mention th a t the great majority of these words occurs only in those Slavonic countries which border on H un gary, so th a t they do not seem to be of Slavic origin, but were most probably borrowed from the Hungarian. If the percentages of all common Hungaro-Indo-European words are added together, we get the impressive high figure of 31.1%. This fully justifies the conclusion th at Hungarians must have had long-lasting contacts with the Indo-European-speaking population in the millenia be fore Christ. But vocabulary concordances alone, without stronger grammatical support, are not sufficiently strong to prove close genetic connec tions between them.
The relations of the Hungarian language are closer with the Satem-branch of the Indo-Europe an and with Oriental languages in general. The internationally reputed specialist in Sanscrit, Alexander Csoma de Koros, summed up his find ings on th at score with the following sentence: “The Sanscrit language shows no stronger rela tionship to any other language than it does to H ungarian” (quoted in P 098 p. 217). And with ref?ard to the highly developed Sum erian language



1)1 Mesopotamia, Prof. C.G. Gostony (Paris) dis covered and mentioned in his book (P 056), th at out of its 53 linguistic features, 51 can be found in present-day Hungarian. The same author hsts over 2,000 Sum erian words which correspond to :is many H ungarian ones. Finally, he mentions the well-known fact th at the native term for the Sumerian language was E-Megir; the same as Magyar in the old phonetical form. All this is decisive data so th a t we m ust conclude th at Su merian (as we call it) was merely an early Hungar ian language. — As for the ancient Egypto-Hungarian linguistic relations, they too are very strong, direct and genetic. Proof of this is the native name of this language: M akari, which is another old form of the word Magyari. Besides, E gypt’s n a tional name remained M isir to the present day, a derivation of the same root, like M asar, Magar, Makar. This author has also deciphered over a hundred short Egyptian texts in his three volumes: “Ancient History of Hungarian-speaking peoples” (P 007). Thus, ancient Egyptian m ust also be considered an old Hungarian language, in the light of the most recent findings. From all the above-mentioned researches, which have been carried out with untiring patience and energy, it is clear th a t almost every language of Eurasia is related to the H ungarian with at least several hundred identical words, while the San scrit, Sumerian and ancient Egyptian languages were cognate with the Hungarian. The first expla



nation of this unexpected conclusion was given by the talented linguist Istvan Horvath, who de clared, already a hundred years ago, th a t Hungari an, in B. C. times, was a widely spread language in the Ancient Orient and also the most polished one, so th a t many younger languages could draw a great deal from its rich vocabulary. But no one has taken this bold statem ent seriously in H orvat’s lifetime. However, it seems now th at he has been vindicated. To-day it is indeed clear that H ungar ian is a very ancient language and it occupies the central place in an extensive network of old languages.^^'
5. The final im portant question to be discussed is this: what would be the most appropriate lin guistic term for the collective appellation of all the languages having genetic connection with Hungarian? The most fitting would be, of course, the one which was historically used for such a purpose: the term Uri ‘A ryan’, meaning ‘Illustri ous, divine (language)’, i.e. a civilized one. This term reappears alm ost regularly in the native names of every inter-related Hungarian, beginning with the “mother tongue” whose Sumerian name
10. The same opinion was expressed in a most recent Ger man language publication by Ferenc Kemeny: “(Dass) (las llngarische einerseits alien eurasischen Sprachen als (imiullaKe gedient hat, andererseits eine echte Urpt .Khe is(, (leren Ursprung aus dem heutigen Bestand il< I <llii n i indciilit; erklaert werden kann (P 078 p. 115;

w:is E-Meg-Ir, the Egyptian one being Mak-Ari, iiiid the H ungarian M ag-Ari.i' The best known o t h e r Aryan languages were Uri, Sub-Ari, Na-Iri ;md Hurri in N orthern Mesopotamia; Lig-Uri, lletr-U ri in Europa; Mund-Ari, Kol-Ari and M a ll ri in India; Ma-Ori in New Zealand, as well as many others.'* Our foregoing conclusions have been recently (onfirm ed point by point by a team of Russian linguists, namely W. Illitch-Switytch, Prof. Diakanov, A.B. Dolgopolski and others. They were successful in proving th at there was a “Primordial Tongue” (Ursprache) on the Eurasian continent, (o which all the other languages were affiliated with c. 650 root-words a t least. They also have determined the geographic area correctly, where the first original language was spoken, namely the
11. That Hungarian is an Aryan tongue par excellence, was stated time and again by a number of linguists; most emphatically be Kristof Lukacsy, who said this: “When I say that Hungarian belongs to the Aryan class of languages, I am summarizing the results of my investi gations of several years, conducted in the field of Hun garian linguistics and antiquities” (P 092 p. 199).
12. “Aryan is the terminus technicus describing one of the great language-groups extending from India to Europe” (P038; see also P 133 and P 132). —Formerly, by mistake, the European languages were collectively classified as Aryan. But their names do not include the distinctive vocable Ari. Their kinship is based only upon the word-stock present in their substratum. —For the Aryan term, see also P 091 pp. 27-30; and Encycl. Britannica, ed. 1947, t. H p. 494.



tract of land from India to A natolia and from the Caucasus to the Persian Gulf. Furthermore, the estimated age of the Primordial Language also corresponds to the Hungarian: it began at the end of the last glacial period, about 12,000 years ago. In addition, the Russian team had purposely in cluded Hungarian in the group of descendants of the primeval language, because its antiquity has been “proven.”** Thus, Hungarian and Russian linguists agree on this point with one another. In our judgement, there is only one point the Russians have missed: they failed to discover the real identity of the primordial language. Instead of calling it by its own historical name “Aryan”, they introduced the confusing “Nostratish” name
13. “Ihm (Illitch-Switytch) war es gelungen, das System der Lautentsprechungen zwischen den indo-europaischen, den uralischen, den altaischen... der khartwelischen, den hamito-semitischen und den dravidischen Sprachen zu erkennen. Diese Lautentsprechungen beziehen sich auf Hunderte von Wortwurzeln einer eurasischen Ursprache deren man die Bezeichnung ‘nostratisch’ oder ‘boreisch’ gab, — writes Dolgopolski in his German language account (P 042). — See also the Hungarian complement to this study by Gy. Hary in Valosag (Budapest, October 1976, p. 177). - Dolgopolski continues thus: “Als Urheimat der boreischen Sprache, kommt nach allem, was wir heute wissen, der Raum von Indien, und von Kaukasien bis zum Persischen Golf, III - “Die boreische Sprachgemeinschaft muss ill iMii.K h ill der mittleren Steinzeit, vor Beginn der liMi|- ii iii/cii. Ix slanden haben...” (P 042).



first, then, discarding it, rebaptized the primeval language “Boreish”. For us, the essential fact is, that H ungarian is recognized as a language in its own right, being, as the mother o f m any others, perhaps the oldest cultural language of all Eura sia. Consequently, when looking for the origin of the Hungarian people, we have to focus our atten tion first of all upon the Ancient Near-East.



3. Their tw o m ost frequently used ethnic names: Magyar and Hungarian
Hungarians are identified with two ethnic names: M agyar and H ungarian. The first one is used in the country’s native language, the second in foreign languages. The different use of the names was already noticed by chronicler Anonymus, the unnamed notary of King Bela, at the end of the X llth century. He said clearly that the Magyars perydiom a alienigenarum Hungarii, et in sua lingua propria Mogerii vocantur. Unfor tunately, he did not disclose the reason for this twofold use; in his time, any difference between the two names no longer existed. Scientists were always eager to find out the original meaning of the names in question. The Etymological Dictionary (P 084 bis) informs us th a t “M agyar’ is “an obscure compound”, with Magy -I- Ar, variously spelt M agar, Mogeri, Meger, Mogur and M iser and meaning, simply, ‘M an’. Geza Nagy, a keen Hnguist, brings us nearer to the answer by teaching th a t M agari is a com pound with two vocables: M at ‘E a rth ’ and A r ‘Man, People’ (P 117 p. 98). But he does not elabo rate upon what the exact meaning of the resulting new word might be. Concerning the etymology of the second name, viz. Hungar, our linguists gener ally believe, th at it is not a Hungarian, but an



old Turkish word, the On-Ogur, meaning ‘Ten Tribes’, as the tribal federation was called, to which the Magari people belonged at one time in the first part of the Vth century A.D. Finally, with regard to the Ar element occurring in both names, our linguists are reluctant to be more definite. On this subject we read in a French publication th a t the term Aryan is not yet sufficiently clarified. Thus, we come to the conclusion th a t we are not on firm soil when looking for the etymology of the Hungarians’ ethnic names on the basis of the available literature. In our judgement, both Magari and Hungari are truly compound words, as it was always supposed. Both of them consist of two vocables: Magy + Ar (<M at-A r), and Hung + Ar (<H ont-A r) respec tively, to which the adjectival suffix -i is appended. To our surprise, the lexical structure of Mag-Ar-i and Hung-Ar-i is identical with th a t of several ancient ethnic names, Hke Lig-Ur-i, Ill-Yr-i, BavAr-i, Can-Ar-i in Europe; Col-Ar-i, Mund-Ar-i, Ma-Or-i in India and New Zealand: and Mak-Ar-i and Onk-Ar-i in ancient Egypt. Today Magari is no longer spelt with the -i suffix, but simply is Magyar, this new graphic form having come into practice towards the end of the X V IIIth century. The comparison of the lexical structure of Magari/Hungari with th at of the other old ethnic
14. «Le nom du peuple Aryen reste jusqu’a present sans explication certaine* (P 091 p. 75).



names suggests th a t their origin may reach far into remote historical times. W hat is the meaning of the composing elements of the names in question? First, the suffix -i ap pearing a t the end of both names, gives them the meaning of ‘Coming from. Native of, Follower o f and the like. The second common element Ar (< Ur) has manifold meanings, but it always implies an im portant personage, who has power of com mand, such as God, a king, a high official or any free man. And the first element in Mag-Ari: Mag (< M a t) means ‘field. L and’. Thus the whole com pound as a new word signifies 1. ‘Subject of the Ruler of the Land’, 2. ‘Fellow citizen’ or 3. simply ‘peasant’. The first element of Hung-Ari: Hunt, is nothing else but the ancient phonetic form of the present Hon, H ont ‘C ountry’. So the full compound name Hungari means ‘Countrym an, N ative’. According to its etymology, it is a perfect Hungarian word, as is Magari itself, and seems to have nothing to do with the Old Turkish ‘Onogur’. Finally, if we are looking for the difference which may have, in olden times, justified the separate use of the two ethnic names, we may suggest that Magari actually stood for peasant, tiller of the soil, whereas Hungari for keepers of animals. But whatever may have been the dif ference between the meaning of the two names in question a t the beginning, it soon disappeared. An allusion was already made to the antiquity of the Magyars’ two ethnic names, which reach



back into pre-historic times. Now, we can confirm it by recalling th a t the M a t vocable is in general use among Finno-Ugrian languages and always means the same thing, namely, ‘Field, Land, Dwelling Place’ (P 110 pp. 85, 88, 89). Considering further that Finns and Estonians have separated from the Hungarian speaking body a t around 2000 B.C., the common Finn-M agyar word in question must have been in existence before the said date, there having been no later contact between the two groups. Consequently, the Magari name may be as old as 4000 years. Let us add to the foregoing th a t M atu was also known in the SumeroBabylonian language as a word for ‘C ountry’ (P 056 p. 64) and th a t “M at Misir” was the current term for Egypt in the Old Persian, and “M at Asyr” th a t for Assyria (P 041 pp. 129,146,148). The same can be said about the word Hon or Hont\ it is also a basic word in the whole Finno-Ugrian lan guage group, meaning in Finnish and Estonian Huona ‘Dwelling place, House’. Furtherm ore, the same word is also included in the Sum erian vocab ulary, in the form of (H)an, (H)anu, signifying ‘Realm of God’, as well as in Ancient Egyptian, where (H)an or (H)on was the name of the city where the Sungod lived, ‘Sun-City’, the Greek Heliopolis in the Delta. Finally, with regard to the second part of the word, Ar ( < Ur): it is generally used both in Sumerian and Egyptian and several other ancient languages, meaning ‘God, King, Ruler or M an’, so th a t it does not require



a detailed explanation. Thus, our inquiry has shown that the Magyar and Hungar names, to gether with their compound elements, can be his torically traced back almost five thousand years. There is hardly another nation in Europe, or perhaps in the whole world, whose name could be tracked down for such a long time.
It is also interesting to have a look a t the various phonetical forms the the Magari and Hungari compounds have taken during their existence as such. The names were first affected by the general softening tendency of the language. It brought about a soundshift after which the T sound, both in M at and Hont, successively changed into D, G and H sounds, with the resulting phonetical forms of MaDar, M aG ar or MagOr, as well as M aHar. Now, these phonetical forms happened to sound similar to the words for ‘Bird’ (Madar), ‘Grain God’ (Mag-ur), ‘Big Nose’ (Mag-orr) and ‘Bee-king’ (Meh-ar, M6h-ur), although the original name had absolutely nothing to do with them. Still, this evolution is of the greatest interest to us, because the homophony between the national name Magyar and the quoted objects gave birth to the idea th a t shaping or drawing a bird, a bee, a face with a big nose, or grains (beads) arranged in a circle (necklace) showed so many appropriate ways to “write” Magyar, i.e. to display one’s ethnic identity. Archaeological discoveries, representing a human figure with a big nose, occur frequently.



especially in ancient Mesopotamia and on the Aegean islands. In Egypt the picture of a bee constituted a regular part of the royal titulary, identifying the king as Mehar or Magyar. The figure of a bird, applied on a brooch, or a bird statuette in clay, or even real birds kept in the house, were, as many, identification badges of the owners.*"’ There is no mistake in Unking these graphic or artistic figures with the presence of a Hungarian-speaking population, because the ho mophony between the ethnic name and the men tioned objects exists only in th a t language, as far as we know. Besides, all this symbolism would have been senseless without the ethno-linguistic impli cations. Of course, it is not easy to discover such similarities without having a good command of Hungarian and a profound knowledge of its past and present phonetical system. At any rate, we can say th at our ancestors had found a method to establish their first written documents about themselves, right at the beginning of the literate period of history. It was certainly a primitive way of writing, but an ingenious one, the so-called pictorial method, the first form of writing. Should we then conclude th at the early Hungarians also were, perhaps, amongst the active forerunners in the invention of writing?
15. Bird-headed statuettes have been found in ancient Mesopotamia already from the time of the Flood (P 006 I p. 56). In Hungary too, bird-headed bone-sticks have been found on several sites (P 050 p. 258).



In summing up the results of our inquiry regard ing the two most frequently used Hungarian eth nic names, we may safely say th a t both of them were products of the Hungarian language; that they originated in the earliest historical times, probably in the Ancient Near-East, and that they identify the Magyars in their religious and politi co-social context.



4. The whereabouts of the Old Fatherland
The previous three chapters have already pro duced enough indication th at the Old Magyar Fatherland was probably situated in the ancient Orient, dom inated by three mighty rivers — Nile, Euphrates and Indus — and which we call NearEast. It appeared, indeed, th at this particular area was the one where the representative of the two races, out of whose fusion the Hungarian nation has come into being, were sumultaneously present; where easily workable soil was available for farm ing, as well as large grazing grounds for stockbreeding; and where the agriculturist Magyars and stock-breeding Kush population intermingled (Fig. 3). The following pages should prove th a t the Ancient Near-East was actually the Old Magyar Fatherland, the land where the Hungarian type of nations have come into being.

In the Euphrates valley, to begin with it, the most typical such place-name was th at of the City of Ur, whose ruins are called even today M ugheir (= Magyar), and which had a Maguerre (= Ma gyar) ruler. Not far from th at city was located Eridu, the oldest settlem ent of the whole Land. Its Hungarian etymology ( < H .: Ur-i To) discloses, that it was built on the shore of a lake, the Present Persian Gulf. Today, the city is far from the Gulf, but in the Ilird millenium B.C. it still stood on the shore, the filling-up of the Euphrates delta
East



with alluvial deposits having not yet been in an Mclvanced stage. A third im portant M esopotamian ( ity with clear H ungarian name was Nippur ( = H.: Nap-Ur), the ‘City of the Sungod’. We know from other sources, th at Nippur was the most impor tant religious centre for the Sun-cult in Mesopotamia lor over a thousand years; a fact which warrants the accuracy of our etymology. Other Mesopota mian place-names, with a striking Hungarian meaning were Sam -A r-R a ( < H.: Szem-Ur) ‘Resi dence of the Eye-God’, a variant of Sungod; MatA r-R a ‘The City placed under the protection of the Farm ers’ God’, and A ssour (< H .: A So Ura) ‘City of the Ruler of the Sand’. A part of the above place-names, the geographic term Burattu de serves special mention. Its rootword is Bor, which is ancient Hungarian for ‘W ater, River’, by which the Euphrates was meant. And the form Burattu is the rootword Bor enlarged with two suffixes, thus: Bor-at-i, to mean ‘Land (or People) Beyond the River’. This name has taken up manifold phonetical forms later on, like Berut, Beyrout, Barat, Brit, etc., and it surfaced at numerous places which the Mesopotamians colonized in sub sequent times (see map showing the diffusion of the B urattu-nam e in P 132 after p. 420). In Syria, Canaan and Anatolia, which were under Mesopo tam ian cultural and political influence for a long time, the most im portant Magyar city-names were: Arpad, on the great bend of the River, about which more will be said later, and K arkem ish and



Damask. The correct transliteration of the Egyp tian hieroglyphs giving the names of Karkemish and Dam ask is : K arika-M asa and Dama-Szeke, meaning -according to the H ungarian key- ‘Depu ty of the Circular D ivinity’ (Sungod), and ‘Resi dence of the Divine Lady’ respectively.
In the second great Oriental river valley, that of the Nile, the two Magyar testwords Ur and Magyar again occur frequently. Ur is included in the name of about a hundred divinities, as anybody may notice it when opening the book of WaUice Budge, The gods of the Egyptians (P 026II Index). The same word reappears in other combinations as well, like in Horus (< H .: Ur-Os) ‘Divine Ances to r’, which was the regular title of the reigning Egyptian king. Another of his titles was M akar, the Egyptian form of Magyar. Contemporary rec ords speak of a M akari Queen, of the XXth D ynasty (c. 1080-940 B. C.), who tragically died in childbirth at an early age. It is also recorded th a t during the reign of K ing Zoser (< H .: As Os Ur) ‘The Divine Ancestor’, a certain M adir ( = Magyar) was the governor of the Elephant City. The very name of Egypt was at th a t time, as it continues to be even today, ‘The Land of Misir' (= Magyar). Finally, near the Red Sea, in Eritrea, at the site called M atara, a Magyar lan guage inscription has been found, and deciphered by the author.
In the third great Oriental river valley, that of the Indus, the two Magyar testwords come up also



Irequently. The whole tract of land from the Caspian Sea to the River Indus, for example, was called A ria ‘The Land of the Aryans’, as indicated in the Dictionary of Mechitar. In th a t same zone lies Iran, whose etymological meaning is not Per sian, but Hungarian: Ur-Hon ‘Abode of the Aryans’. Plinius, writing in the first century A.D., when listing the various peoples of India says this: Indum accolunt Megari... Uri and other peoples (P 092 p. 98). Toppeltinus writes in the same sense, stating th at the inhabitants of India are called Magori even in his time, and th a t they are a powerful people, possessing a famous land, thanks to their victorius army.*^ The seven great ances tors of the Hindus were the M ahar-Ishi (< H .: Magyar Os) ‘M agyar Ancestors’, and the most celebrated Hindu dynasty was also called ‘M a gyar’; Maury. It was founded around 315 B.C., and at its hight, ruled over an immense kingdom, extending from Afghanistan to Ceylon. Finally, the first comprehensive name for India was B arat Varsha (< H .: B arat Varosa) ‘Land of the B arats’.i”
17. Toppeltinus; “...etiamnum vocantur Magori. Ingens populus et ipsi armorum gloria inclytum regnum possident” (P 092 pp. 98, 203). 18. L.A. Waddell comments Barat-Varsha thus: “The Land of the Barats (Barat Varsha) a name synonymous with ‘Barat Ana’ or ‘Land of the Barats’, which I have proved to be the original form of the name ‘Brit-Ain’ as given to Albion about 1100 B.C. by... the same Aryan race



Apart from the numerous place- and and ethnic names built with the word Ur and Magyar, the presence of the Magyar population in all three focal points of the Ancient N ear-East can be evidenced by pictorially written documents as well. This writing, as already explained, com municates abstract ideas with the pictures of con crete objects, whose names sound identically. In this way, the Magyars of a given place, could be identified with the picture of a bird, for which the Hungarian word is M adar, sounding like Magyar. A second animal, which was used to identify a Magyar ruler, was the lion Oroszldn (< H .: Ur-OsLeny) ‘Primeval Divine Ancestor’. We have two good examples to illustrate the above. First, a hon-headed bird, M adar, found in the ruins of the City of Ur. It is represented with outstretched wings, hovering over two deer, Szarvas (< H .: Az Ur-Os) ‘The Divine Ancestor (Fig. 4). The m ean ing of this combined symbol (bird and two deer) is M agyar Ur-0s6k ‘Hungarian Divine Ancestors’. On the other hand, an early example of the use of the lion-symbol for identification purposes is the well-known image of Gilgamesh, the legendary ruler of the city of Uruk, who is depicted as holding a lion cub in his arm. The meaning is ‘Primeval Divine Ancestor’, a title similar to the pompous “king-of-kings”. In Egypt, we have found the Ma
of Barats... who civilized India and the Ganges valley” ( P 132 bis p. 10); see also the entry under ‘Barata Varsha’ in P 044).

ffyar name spelt with hieroglyphs very clearly as M -A-K h-aR (land) (Fig. 7) and in another in stance as A M a-Ti-aR -K u-R a ‘The R uler of the Magyars’ (Fig. 8). Thus, it seems clear that the IJri (= Ari) M agyar ethnic element was strikingly present in the whole A ncient Orient, in the B.C. times. This is a major historical discovery whose far-reaching significance hardly escapes the a t tention of the reader.
2. The next question is whether the same can be said about the darkish complexioned ethnic element, which made up 15-20% of the Hungarian ethnic body. The comprehensive name of this people was Kush, and in the jargon of the anthro pologists: M editerraneans or Touranians. It ap pears in various graphic forms, such as Kush, Cush, Kushan, Cassi, whereas its Hungarian form is Kus (pron. Kush), and meaning ‘Ram (people)’. Their Ram-name indicates, th a t they were, first of all, a stock-breeding population, keepers of sheep and swine. In the Nile valley, i.e. in Egypt, they were pictorially identified with a flat horned ram, whose most elaborate exemplar was found in the Nubian colony of Sulb (Fig. 9). At one time, a row of ram -statues flanked the far side of the road leading to the temple of God Amen, while the near side of the road was lined with lion-statues, the symbol of Magyars. They were also raising pigs, so their country was called Sertes-Hon ‘The Pig C ountry’, and its ruler was the ‘R uler of the Pig C ountry’ (See in P 007 II ill. 20), also in plain Hungarian.

In addition to the ram and pig, the Egyptian Kush were ethnically identified with the picture of their erect-eared, gracile hunting dog of a dark colour. This animal played the same role for the Kush as the lion did for the Magyars. It was considered as the ancestor of the dark people, and its name has been transliterated as Anubis, with an unk nown meaning. If we consider, however, the hiero glyphs of the name (Fig. 12), it discloses th a t the right transliterataion is A nep ose (A Ne-P U-Se), which is again in Hungarian and means ‘The Ancestor of the Folk’. In later times, the spotted leopard and the wolf were also in certain places, substitutes for “Anubis”. The Egyptian Kush of the First Cataract had held a dark skinned lady in great esteem whom they considered their local forebear. Her name was written with four signs: with an arrow carrying the sound-group SAT or SET, then with two half-loaf shaped T and with a sitting woman figure NU. We also notice th at the arrow transfixes an animal skin PAR (= H.: Bor). T hus this w ritten source identifies the lady in question in full H un garian as SAT-T-eT boru NU Setet borii no, literally ‘Dark skinned W oman’, exactly as tradi tion had preserved her memory. From this example we altogether learn th a t the Kush were also called by the name o f ‘D ark’ SetH. King Ramses I (more accurately: Ra-M asa, ‘Deputy Sungod’) had been governor of the Nubian colony prior to his ascen sion to the throne of Egypt, and continued to keep



liis earlier title when king. T h at is w hat his double ( artouche (Fig. 13) discloses, when read with the Hungarian key: Ra mdsa, Szuddn ura; Ra mene, Feketek ura ‘Deputy Sungod, R uler of Sudan; Stallion of the Sungod, Ruler of the Blacks’. So, incidentally we also learn th a t the Kush were even called simply Blacks, Feketek.
In the Euphrates valley, i.e. in Mesopotamia, the regular Kush identifying symbol was also a ram, but one of local species with horns twisted in the form of a V. Its most beautiful exemplar has been found in the City of Ur, and dated from the Ilird millenium B.C. The animal is represented peering from the branches of a Tree of Life, indi cating th a t it is the ancestor. In M esopotamian cuneiform writing, the Kush are referred to as “The dark headed ones” and as NAM LULU. Considering that the sounds L and R have the same writing sign, and th a t duplication of a sign means plural case, the correct transliteration of the quoted expression should be N em ur.ak, ‘Non Aryans’, which is w hat the Kush really were. In the third great river valley of the Orient, the Indus valley, the number of Kush was exceedingly high, and the so-called “Indus valley seals” offer abundant information about them. Nevertheless, they have less significance in H ungarian ancient history, because the Danubian Hungarian ethnic body derived very little from them. Therefore, we are restricted to only one Hungarian written mes sage they had left to us. It expresses, so to speak.



the philosophy of every Kush ruler worth of this name. The seven worded sentence in question runs thus: Uralkodo kedves, ha fuvesiti a rdndkat orszagaban ‘A ruler is liked if he does grow grass on the open lands of his realm ’ (see details in P 007 II ill. 36). —As the reader may judge for himself, there is plenty of evidence to show that the darkish coloured Kush population had actually occupied large areas in and around the agriculturist M a gyar domains in the entire Ancient Near-East, during pre-Christian times.
3. M ention m ust yet be made as to how the relations between Magyars and Kush developed, and how they finally led to the formation of “Hungarian nations” in the Old Fatherland. The connections between the two races in the NearEast lasted for over two thousand years. At the beginning of this long period, their contacts were characterized rather by mutual distrust and open hostilities. As a result, the Kush were defeated almost everywhere and subjected to political and culturel assimilation. They lost a great deal of their people but, in exchange, received the badly needed higher education, which contributed to their later development. The second phase of their contacts was characterized by large scale inter marriages and the coming into existence of com bined ‘Ario-Kush’ or ‘Cush-Ari’ nations, as this process is well known in Mesopotamia, India, Egypt and Touran alike.



In the second millenium B.C., the Kush in M esopotamia were already so strongly civilized th at they were capable of taking over the govern ment of the land for a while, and freely intermin gled with the Aryans. In India the situation was similar, the Kush were on equal footing with the Magyars there, and the Indus-valley civihzation, around 2500 B.C., was their common creation. In c. 1650/1500 B.C., however, a great catastrophe had befallen India when newly formed Aryan societies (Aryans II) violently penetrated into the Land, coming from the West, and while they were busy occupying the Ganges valley, they disrupted the previous population and split it into several blocks in bloody battles, which are echoed in the famous poem of M aha Bharata or ‘The Great B arat’. During th a t general upheaval, the com mixing of the two races advanced farther. Those groups which left India and went westwards peo pled Makran, Iran, Afghanistan and Touran. Others fled through the passes and gorges of the Hindu-Kush and descended into the Oxus valley. Following these large ethnic displacements, sever al places were given a second name, or changed the existing one to reflect the new realities. The former Hyrcanian (= Aryan) Sea, for example, was being called Caspian Sea, i.e. Kush W ater, and the former Northern Sea changed into Sea of the Blacks or Black Sea. Double-named rivers and nations were born, like Araxes (Ario-Kush) river, and Casari (Kush-Arian) nation. Amongst the



latter, people were found with so dark a complex ion th a t “one would readily believe th a t they were descendants of the H indus”, —as observed by Ibn H aukal (P 092 p. 57). W ith the passing of time, the fusion of the two races advanced so far th at alm ost everyone had both Aryan and Kush blood in his veins, and everyone considered himself, with full right, of Kushitic and Aryan descent at the same time. In other words, the terms Kush and Aryan became interchangeable. At th at stage, M echitar was right in saying in his Dictionary, th a t Aria is also called the ‘Land of the K ush’. In the Nile valley, the Kush first appeared in the region of K hartum around 6000 B.C. In the subsequent millenia, they inundated the whole length of the valley so th a t when the Magyars arrived under their leader Menes, in c. 3200 B.C., they had to fight against dark men to secure a homeland for themselves there. At the end of the first round of struggling, it seemed th at a kind of political condominium would be established between the two peoples, as the simultaneous appearance of the Aryan bird-symbol and the Kush dog-symbol on the national armories of Egypt suggests. But shortly thereafter, a formal sharing of the Nile valley took place whereby the dark men agreed to evacuate th at section of the river valley which lies above the First Cataract. This division had, however, not calmed the aggres siveness of the Blacks, who launched frequent in cursions into the domain of the Magyars. As a



result, their country was gradually conquered and transformed into a colony around 1500 B.C. The Kush were then pacified for a long period and did not regain their independence until 945 B.C. But, by th at time, they were already a completely civilized, modem nation. While these events unfolded south of Egypt, the Delta itself had been under Kush rule for about two hundred years, the so-called “period of Hyksos rule”. The Hyksos were, however, driven out from Egypt in 1576 B.C. together with their native Egyptian helpers. The bulk of the exiles settled in Syria and Canaan, mostly in the city-states of Carchemish, Arpad and Damask. The Egyptian kings of the X lX th Dynasty relentlessly kept on pursuing them, always pushing them farther and farther, until they left Africa for good and settled in Europe, including Hungary. The fusion in Egypt of the remaining dark elements with the white ones was as thourough as it was in Mesopotamia and in Touran, and the Egyptians themselves finally believed th at they too originated from two ances tors, M agyar and Kush.''*
19. “They called it /E gypt/ the land o\ M ezor ( = Magyar) and the land of Cham / =K ush/ from their two ances tors, which the Greek rendered Mesora and Chamia" (P 023 p. 298). — The same idea i.s expressed in the following quotation “Throughout the early dynastic period and the Old Kingdom /o f Egypt/ Set ( = the dark ruler ) and Horus (the Aryan ruler) are represented as the two patron-deities of the Monarchy” (John Van Saters, The Hyksos, London 1966 p. 98).



To sum up, our inquiry has shown th a t 1. the birth o f the M agyar speaking ‘H ungarian type’ of nations has taken place in the Ancient NearEast through the fusion of two rival races: the Aryan with the Kush; therefore that area must be considered as the original M agyar Fatherland. It is also clear that 2. the population o f Danuhian Hungary originated from the Old Fatherland: in the first round directly from Mesopotamia and Egypt, and in the second from the Caspi-OxusA ral area (Touran); in wave after wave arriving according to the pulse of historical events (the Semitic and Turkish expansions in the same re gion) which forced them to leave their native lands.



THEIR EARLIEST CIVILIZATION
1. The Old Hungarian script
1. Prior to the adoption of the Rom an alphabet in the early X lth century, Hungarians used a set of sound-signs of Phoenician origin for writing. The historical term for this old system of writing is Rovds, meaning ‘incised, engraved’ or ‘carved’ script, the name describing the technique of writ ing. Foreign language scientists called it “linear” or “geometric shaped” script, thereby alluding to the form of writing. On this subject, there is an abundant literature beginning with the very precious Latin language work of J. Telegdi from 1598 (reproduced in P 115 p. 91 and f.). More recently, two eminent compre hensive works were written, one by Gyula Sebestyen (P 115 and P 116), and the other by Dezso Csallany (P 035). Thanks to these and to similar other publications, we have a perfectly clear idea how this system worked: we know which were the sound-signs, the rules of writing and the writing m aterial as well. In addition, some forty extant original inscriptions allow us to see the system in operation. The incised or linear script was, in all probability, invented in the ancient Orient, al though the specific area remains unknown. It is, however, clear th at the earliest form of this writing



was simplified by Phoenician scribes who then spread it all over the Mediterranean from the X lth century B.C. onward. It is also known th a t a similar type of writing existed in the Indus valley already in the second millenium B.C. In subse quent times, this was also simplified and spread to Lower and Upper Asia, mainly amongst Turkish peoples. Finally, following the opinion of Sir Flinders, then Petrie, several scientists main tained th at the earliest incised signs were used at Abydos, in the Upper Nile valley for the purpose of pot-marking, in Neolithic times around 3200 B.C. Thus, a higher chronology seems to be prefer able for this invention, the more the ancient H un garian word for scribe is Tudo, which is the same in ancient Egyptian (Tutu and Thot), in Sumerian (Tudu) and also in Finnish (Tataa). After H ungary’s conversion to Christianism, the carved script, like everything associated with pa ganism, became a Habihty. Therefore, its use was banned by King St. Stephen (1000-1038) who also ordered the destruction of all the existing records written with the “diabolical letters.” With the passing of time, the existence of the Old Magyar writing was almost totally forgotten. Its last ves tiges were swept away with the appearence of modern writing m aterial and the invention of printing.
W hat we know about the sound-signs of the H ungarian carved script, may be summed up in the following. First, th a t in the X lllth century.



under the impact of the Roman alphabet, the list of the Hungarian sound-signs was gradually en larged, to become a regular alphabet, i.e. having a special sign for each sound. But up to th a t period, and earlier in history, this writing used a consider ably smaller number of graphic signs. The paucity of the signs required is explained by the fact th a t in this writing there is no difference between short and long vowels, consequently it needs only five signs to write them instead of fourteen. Further more, the scribes often used unvoiced consonants (T and P) to write their voiced counterparts (D and B), whereby new cuts could be made. The number of required writing symbols were even further reduced by eliminating the vowel signs. This was possible by the particular character of Hungarian, wherein vowels have no grammatical role, the root remaining always unchanged. The “vowel dropping” or “vowel jumping” as this prac tice was called, was further justified by invoking the phonetical particularity that every consonant already includes a vowel sound with which it is uttered. Thus, adding a special sign for this vowel, would be superfluous. At this stage, the names Barabas and Aladar could have been written as B-R-B-S and L-D-R respectively and the reader had to supply the necessary vowels in speech. With the almost total elimination of vowels, the conso nants have taken over the leading role in the writing. Therefore, the carved script was also called a “consonantal script.”



According to the principal rule of writing, all words were to be written phonetically, as they were uttered, irrespective of etymology, exactly as in present-day shorthand. A second rule required th at the words of a given message be written immediately one after another, without separating them by a white space or in any other way. Thirdly, the direction of writing depended largely on the nature of the writing material. In the earliest times, and as long as the writing was done with a knife on small sticks or wooden tablets, the direction was usually from right to left. In more recent times, when paper, ink and pen came into use, the natural direction of writing with the right hand went from left to right, starting at the upper left end of the paper. Writing by incision on wood, stone slabs or metal plates was a time-consuming operation, especially when the place of the individual signs had first to be marked out for some valid reason, such as symmetry or exiguity of space. Thus, the need for accelerating the writing appeared very soon. The easiest way to do this consisted of creating abbre viations for the most frequently used words, such as God and Sun. But the most effective method consisted of combining two or more signs into a single figure, saving strokes here and there. Such graphic contraction or “ligatures” most frequently resulted in the case of N and T, S and T, A and R, K and R, etc. (see the sign-lists. Fig. 14). The frequent use of combined signs was a special fea

ture of the Hungarian incised writing at its zenith. The principal rules of the carved script must always be kept in mind, not only when we are deciphering inscriptions in Hungary, but in exa mining Ancient Near-Eastern inscriptions as well, the principles of old writings having been the same everywhere and in all systems. The Old Hungarian writing was often called a “Scythian script”, “Hunnic way of writing” or “Siculi alphabet”. These three denominations are as many indica tions warning us th at several socio-cultural groups (Scythians, Huns, Siculs) were using the Magyar writing system in the Danube basin prior to the advent of the Arpad H ungarians in 895 A.D. In other words, they must all have been interrelated Hungarian type of nations. A similar conclusion results from the fact th at the knife, which was the principal writing instru ment all over South-W estern Asia, was known everywhere by the Hungarian word Kes (pron. Kash). For example, the deadly knife every Scyth ian kept in his boot-leg, was A Cina Kesh. This word Kes is mentioned several times by Ptolemy in his Geography when describing the Oxus region. Knife, even in the ancient Egyptian language was Kesh. These data will help researchers figure out the vast area where the Hungarian version of the carved script was in use.
2. Let's now consider three specimens o f the Old H ungarian script. The first one (Fig. 15) was found on the old wall of the Presbyterian church



of Dalnok in the H^romszek county during repairs. It uses frequent ligatures and reads from left to right. We transliterate it thus: eSZ.T aR-eG.I Fa(l)-R-A. R6-Ja 0-Ko.Ri Ma-G.aR R.O-N-A/K -aL /. W ith present Hungarian speUing: E zt a regi falra roja okori magyar ru n d /kka l/. In E n glish: ‘This is being incised on the old wall /w ith / archaic Magyar rune/s/.-" The second inscription shown (Fig. 16) was in cised on the wall of the Ambassadors’ Hostel in Constantinople (Turkey). It records, in three lines, the rough handling of the members of the embassy, sent to Sultan Selim I by King Ladislas of H un gary in 1515. The inscription was first deciphered by William Thomsen (Copenhagen), then com pleted by Gyula Sebestyen, and corrected by Dezso Csallany (P 035 p. 77). It reads from right to left, the first line (only reproduced here) saying: ‘This was written in the year 1515 when King Ladislas’ five envoys were kept there waiting.’ The third inscription shown (Fig. 17) was paint ed on the ceiling of the Unitarian church of Enlaka in Udvarhely county, in 1688. It reads also from right to left and proclaims the fundamental
20. The transliteration of carved signs into Roman charac ters is usually done 1. with capital letters for the graphically expressed sounds; and 2. with small charac ters for the sounds supplied by the decipherer. And 3. in our transliterations a dot is inserted between the elements of every combined sound-sign. 4. The omitted consonants or words are given in parentheses (), while 5. the broken-oflf and missing signs are in brackets /.../.

doctrine of the U nitarian confession, th a t God is only one person (contrary to the Catholic doctrine of Trinity). The same principle is repeated twice nearby in Latin thus: “Deus unicus” and “In honorem unius veri Dei”. The message in Hungari an runs thus: Egy az Isten. Deut.VI. Georgyius M usnai deakon, ‘God is (only) one. Deut. VI., George Musnai deacon.’ 3. A pleasant feature of the Old Hungarian script was th at its inscriptions were quite fre quently accompanied by some pictorial drawing, as is the case in the Enlaki (Fig. 17) inscription. These pictures are not only added for the sake of illustration; they are fulfilling a more important role: they usually emphasize the main point of the message. As such, they constitute a special

kind of writing with pictures. As was already illustrated when dealing with the Magyar and Kush symbols, this method of idea-communication was based upon the homophony exist ing between two different words, mostly between a noun and a verb, i.e. between a concrete and an abstract idea. Exam ples: Fog as a noun signifies T o o th ’ and as verb it m eans ‘To grasp’; and H al is ‘Fish’ as a noun and ‘T o die’ when it is a verb. Now, to write the ab stract idea ‘To grasp’ or ‘To die’, the scribe had to revert to the concrete object to write the pictorially inexplicable idea. In such cases, either the context or some additional sign warns the reader th a t the sound-signs signify something abstract. Given the very special charac ter of the pictorial writing, if we can successfully decipher such writing in H ungarian, we thus have the decisive proof th a t th e text is in Hungarian. In the case of the Enlaki inscription (Fig. 17), the pictorial complement includes a paragraph like sign on the four sides of the frame; this is the regular sign for the double-lettered GY-sound. W ith its built-in vowel, it means eGY, egy ‘one’. Then, in the centre-stage, there is a milk-jar with flowers. T he H ungarian word for milk-jar is K6csog, whose Old Hungarian form Ketseg is homophonous with Ketseg ‘D oubt’. The flowers in the jar are tulips, in Hungarian Tulipdn, a homophon of Tele-van, ‘Is full’. Now, when all these homophonous elements are put together, the following sentence emerges: EGY-KETSEG-TELE-VAN.



In present day Hungarian: Egy ketsegtelen van, indicating once again the U nitarian dogma: ‘One (divine person) doubtless exists.’ Of course, for a reader not versed in Hungarian, it is not easy to follow the acrobatic stu n ts displayed by the scribes of pictorial messages. In conclusion, we may say th a t the Hungarian carved script dates back considerably farther than was supposed until now and that its importance goes far beyond what was acknowledged by cer tain foreign authors. The Old Hungarian script is a strong link which binds the H ungarians to the Near-East where the first literate nations of the world had emerged. A ll that has a consider able bearing upon the historical role of the early Hungarians.



2. The Old Hungarian faith
1. It is a foregone scholarly conclusion th a t zealous Magyar kings of Christian Hungary put all their energy into eradicating the last roots of the old pagan creed from the M agyars’ soul.-’ These kings, indeed, ordered the destruction of the heathen altars and temples, and severely punished the venerators of rivers, fountains, groves, trees and stars. The kings also persecuted the diehard servants of the ancient divinities, treated them as pariahs and committed them to the care of Saint Lazar. W hatever element of the old belief and custom escaped the purge was baptized and incor porated into the new religion, or relegated into the realm of folklore.-^
21. The word Pogany ‘Pagan’ originates from the Latin Pagus ‘Village’ and Paganus ‘Villager’, signifying ‘Peo ple living in the countryside.’ In the Middle Ages, the same word was, however, used in a pejorative sense to say ‘uneducated, backward, despicable’, especially when speaking of non-Christian people. The alternative word for Pagan is Heathen. It is probably derived from the Old Hungarian word HHh ‘Seven’, a shortened from of the expression ‘Follower of the Seven Great Gods.’ 22. Hungarian chronicles preserved the memory of the cruel treatment King St. Stephen inflicted upon Thonuzoba who “stubbornly adhering to his beliefs, was unwilling to become a Christian, and was buried alive with his wife” (P 120 I p. 117). A simileu* cruel punishment was imposed upon a woman, Raski by name, who was



It would be, nevertheless, a hasty conclusion to say th at the Magyar kings totally succeeded in brainwashing all segments of the population. There remained, indeed, much evidence proving the survival of the old faith, not only in folklore and place-names, but even in the royal adm inistra tion. Moreover, the elements constituting the old faith were to a great extent brought into the Christian reHgion, including the very name of the heathen god, so th a t Christianization cannot be interpreted as total break with the past. As a major proof of this, Arnold Ipolyi, author of a monumen tal “Hungarian mythology”, was able to collect a more than ample documentation about the old faith as late as the second half of the X lX th century. Moreover, the work of Ipolyi has been completed since then, with plenty of new, detailed data. W hat the otherwise successful scientists were unable to prove, however, was the positive identifi cation of the chief Magyar divinity: the Sungod. Therefore, they also failed to established the rela tionship of the Magyar faith to the great Oriental solar religion, especially with th at of Egypt.
prominent in a heathen uprising: “(She) was captured by the very Christian King Bela and confined in prison until she ate her own feet, and also died in the same place” (P 120 I p. 398). Persecutions of adherents to the old faith continued until about the middle of the X lllth century, the last dreaded inquisitor having been Johannes Theuthon (+1252), commissioner of the Holy See to several Central European states (P 047).



2. An Arab historian, Ibn R usta, in reporting about Hungarians of the IX th century, observed th a t "'they are worshippers o f the S u n a n d the M oon” This summary statement emphasizes the root of the m atter, which can be advantageously completed with Magyar sources. In a pagan M a gyar hymn to the Sun, we read for example this: “Thou a rt the primeval Tree of Life... from which everything springs; by which the night of evil spirits is chased; to which everything in th is world returns” (P 130 p. 7). The rising Sun was greeted by the farmers of the Csik county with their hats off, and with the following words: “Be welcome, oh Sun, thou bringest us daylight and giveth warm th to our soil. Be blessed, thou, who disperses the dark clouds, and ripens our ears. Be glorified thou, who waters our crops and adorns our fields with flowers” (P 125 p. 339 and f.; P 020). These quotations prove th at their idea of God included the belief in a divine creation, and th a t God governs the created world. It is also clear th a t the Sungod was mostly venerated in his capacity as tutelary deity of the agricultural population. His most important task was to illuminate the Earth, which he did by means of a shining globe th at travelled daily across the firmament from east to west.
God’s principal residence was supposed to have been in Heaven, inside the fiery disk, called N ap ‘Sun’. He also had dwellings on E arth, especially in stone idols, called Balvany ( < O.H.: Baluan



=Bal-Hon), ‘Idol’, literally ‘God’s home’, in Latin Simulacrum ‘Hiding place’. T h e num erous stone idols served as appropriate places for God to keep a close watch over the behaviour of his creatures. Other earthly houses reserved for God were the temples, built in a round shape and therefore called Rotundae in Latin. The inside diameter of such temples hardly measured over four to six meters and they were erected during the XIX lllth centuries; about a hundred of them have already been identified. In spite of the fact th at they were erected in the Christian era, they could not have been intended for Christian rites, because all the believers could not attend the ceremonies in such a small space. Several place-names refer to the former existence of Rotundae, being com pounded with the word Kerek ‘R ound’, such as Kerek-Egyhaza, ‘Sacred House of the Round Shaped God’; Kerekes-Kapolna ‘Circular Chapel.’ Many other villages in Hungary are called Egerszeg (Eg-Ur-Szeke) ‘Throne of the Heavenly Lord’, suggesting th at in such places too, regular divine services used to be held. Still other places were reserved for religious feasts. These were often
23. King Saint Stephen mentions in his gift-charter granted to the nuns of Veszpr6m-Valley: “Ibi stat meta lapidea, que volgo Baluan vocatur,” “There stands a boundarystone, called Idol by the local population.” —Similarly, King Andr^ I ordered in his edict of 1047: “Falsos deos abrogare et Simulacra demoliri”, “to suppress the false gods and to destroy the idols” (P 082 p. 367).



hilltops, as their names indicate, like Bdlvdny-Ko ‘Place of Idol’; A ldo Ko ‘Place of Blessings’; OltdrKo ‘A ltar Stone’; Isten Szeke ‘God’s T hrone’; Aldom ds-Teto ‘Celebration Peak’, etc. (P 082 p. 365 f.).
The general name for God was Isten, with no certain etymology. For this word there was a special sign in the carved script, resembling a combination of three consonantal signs: S-T-N. While the special sign for Sun resembled an in verted S crossed with four oblique strokes (see the sign-list, Fig. 14), God’s name was often preceded by the word Ur ‘Lord’ to say Ur-Isten ‘Lord God’. Because of God’s round-shaped appearance, he was called K6r-Isten, ‘Circular Shaped God’, a name, which may be the origin of our word Kereszteny (< 0.H .: Koroszten), ‘Christian’. Living in the Sky (H.: Eg), God was also called Eg-Ura ‘Sky God’. B ut he was also referred to by the well-known Oriental name of R a ‘Sungod’, espe cially to indicate places, mountains, and rivers enjoying divine protection. Such names were like these: Ra-Monya, Ra-Mocsa, Ra-T6t, Ra-Kos, Ra-D6c, Ra-H6; and in reverse word-order: NyitRa, Mu-Ra, Tat-Ra, Fat-Ra, Mat-Ra. The name of the Sungod was evoked several times each day, whenever people met. In the morning, they greeted one another — as they do even today — with the saying J o reggelt ‘Good m orning’, literally Jo R a K elt ‘The good Ra has risen’. And in the evening the greeting formula



was —and is —J o estet ‘I wish a good Sundown’. Of course, the original meaning of these expres sions has long been forgotten and nobody thinks of the daily movements of the Sun any more. The ancients, however, autom atically linked every phenomenon of the daily life to God’s intervention. The Sungod in Hungary had over a thousand Sun-symbols. One group of such symbols was usually geometric in design, consisting of spirals, circles, globes, rosettes, inverted S-forms linked to one another, and sun-beams radiating from a central spot. These symbols are seen everywhere, cut in stone, painted, or artistically represented. A typical object upon which several of these ele m ents appear sim ultaneously is the Sun-gate, as the decorated entrance to many Magyar houses in E astern Hungary is called. Upon such a door of Csik-Szent-Kiraly (Fig. 18), the rising Sun is represented with its beams, and the door of Harasztosi, in Torda Aranyos county (Fig. 19) has spirals carved upon the door-posts on both sides which are flanked by two attending stone idols, with globe-like heads. And on the top of the door, a series of pigeon-holes allow these birds to nestle there. Birds and deer appear most frequently amongst the animal symbols. Birds without out stretched wings usually indicate sorrow and grief; with outstretched wings (as the eagle and falcon), they symbolize the glorious Sun. The deer as solar symbol was used in the winter solstice ceremony. Its role was to bring back the shining disk of the

Sun between its horns, after it was reborn on December 25th. Anthropomorphic representations of God were less frequent. Hungarian archaeologists have nev ertheless unearthed a beautiful terracotta divine statuette, representing a man, sitting on a throne and holding the Isten-symbol in his hand (Fig. 23). On the other hand, the human eye was often used to represent God on numerous occasions, probably

because the Sun was considered as an all-seeing One-Eyed Giant. In this connection he was called Szem -U r and Szem es ‘Eye God’ and ‘He who has an Eye’. The eye-motive is one of the most fre quent decorative elements in Hungarian folklore and is called Isten szem e ‘God’s Eye’ (P 014 p. 78). Several villages and rivers were placed under the protection of the Eye-God, e.g. Szem es-on-Lake Balaton, Szomoroc and the river Szamos ( = Szemes). In spite of the many traces of this Suncult in Ancient Hungary, it is alm ost unbelievable th a t no major research has been devoted to this prob lem of param ount historical importance. Shorter investigations have only been made during the last few years and shed some light upon certain aspects of the role of the Sungod in Hungary (P 004; P 003; P 121; P 020 and P 122). 3. Under whatever name the solar divinity might have been venerated in Hungary, it always had a multitude of servants at its disposal called Papok in the plural, and Pap in the singular, meaning ‘Priests’. They had a lot of things to do. Their duties included star-gazing, and the obser vation of the yearly path of the Sun, especially for the purpose of calendar-making. Certain other priests were assigned to special tasks, as was the case of the ‘Eye priests’ or ‘Sem priests’, whose distinctive garment was the spotted leopard skin thrown across over the shoulders when officiating. A further group of special priests consisted of ‘Male



priests’ {Kan papok), whose exact duties have, however, not yet been elucidated with sufficient clEirity. At any rate, this saying was associated with them: K dr a kanpapnak a rak, which reads identically from both ends and means th a t “it is futile serving crab to a male priest.” This is because he dares not eat it, crabs being sacred to the solar divinity. Every priest used holy water extensively when officiating, exercised many charms and often wore a mask. When he was not wearing one, a feather was his usual head ornament. Amongst the intermediaries between God and his followers, the Taltos or Tatos, ‘Scientists’ had a somewhat spectacular role, similar to th at of the medicine-men. Their name originates from the word Tudo ( < O.H.; T utu), meaning literally ‘He who has knowledge.’ They also were known as Bolcsek ‘Wise m en’. They were capable of curing diseases, averting elemental catastrophes, knew how to purify wells, and could reveal the where

abouts of stolen objects, and so on. T heir ceremo nial garment was made of feathers, and a long one was fixed upon the head. Their footwear was also decorated with bird-claws. They spoke the bird-language (bird = m adir = Magyar), and their equipment included a ladder (P 040; P 047; P 086). The T atos had the power of ascending to Heaven and entering into direct contact with the Sungod. To this end he used his high ladder. The presence of a ladder, Letra in Hungarian, was to emphasize, pictorially, the sense of the ceremony, this word being homophonous with the abstract idea of Ldt-Ra: “Ra (the Sungod) sees me.” ’^
The most important religious feast was the winter solstice on December 25th when the Sun, after having reached the lowest point of its yearly wanderings, began to rise again. The ‘Returning Sun’ or ‘Reborn Sun’ was celebrated in all corners of the country with the performance of a drama whose central theme was a miraculous deer coming through the clouds from Heaven, bearing and bringing back between its horns, the shining disk of the Sun (P 015 p. 71). The sum m er solstice on June 21 was another great religious holiday in Ancient Hungary. Its purpose was to celebrate the glorious rising of the Sun to the peak of its yearly
24. A witness who attended a meeting of wise-men, testified before the Christian inquisitor by saying: “Wiseman Bansa climbed to the top of a high ladder, stayed there for a while, chatting with God and, back on earth, he foretold the future to his audience” (P 047 p. 56).



path. It was marked with colossal mountain-top fireworks. In Old Hungarian rehgious thinking, death was not considered the end o f m a n ’s existence-, it was rather regarded as the most important turning point of a life which continued thereafter in eternal happiness in the company of the Big Bird, as an ‘Associated bird’, i.e. a semi-divine being. The transition from earthly to eternal life was marked with great solemnities. The coffin of the well-to-do farmer was carried to the grave on a cart drawn by six oxen and various objects were put into the coffin, a custom proving beUef in an afterlife. Amongst such objects, a needle and thread were also included to enable the deceased to mend his garment when necessary. Money was also put into the hand of the deceased so th a t he could pay for the toll when marching over the plank leading to the other world. And the grave-digger had to be rem inded to make a ‘window’ on the new home of the defunct, so th a t he might come up on certain days to see his divine m aster the Sun (P 077 p. 59-62). The memory of the defunct was kept alive by a stone monument erected upon the grave and provided with a short inscription and geometric symbols. A special Hungarian feature was the equilateral cross sign MAS C£irved within a circle (AR or RA), stating th at the defunct had become M as-A r or Ra-M ds ‘D eputy for God’ or a ‘Hero’. A nother widely spread custom was —and is even



today —to mark the burial place with a beautiful ly-carved wooden column made by the deceased himself before his death. This column reveals to Ihe initiated the sex, age, rank and wealth of the (lead person. In the case of a male, the top of the column is usually conic while th a t of a female is hollow or tulip-shaped. The column commemo rating a child is usually smaller in size and light in colour (Fig. 20; P 135 and P 069).
4. How long m ay the suncult have been p ra c tised by the Hungarians? In connection with this question we have to remember th a t Estonians and Finns originally lived together with a group of Hungarian-speaking peoples until their ways part ed around 2000 B.C. and, notw ithstanding the great time-span separating them, they too have kept ahve a substantial number of identical Sunsymbols in their folklore. The giant tree reaching into Heaven is called in Finnish Sam-Po, pro nounced Szem-Fa in Hungarian (after P > F), ‘Eye-God’s T ree’; while Sam -M as in Finnish re sembles the H ungarian Szem-M^is ‘D eputy for Eye-God’. Such and similar concorandces suggest th at the Suncult belonged to the spiritual heritage of all Hungarians of any denomination before 2000 B.C. Another tim e-elem ent is to be found in the Old Hungarian ballad “Julia, the beautiful girl.” Reference is made therein to the spring equinox which was then celebrated during the zodiacal constellation of the Bull (Taurus) group of stars. It is now known from astronomical calculations



th a t said constellation occurred just around 2000 B.C. (P 122). As mentioned above, this chrono logical evidence confirms th a t the Suncult was practised by early Hungarians in the New Stone Age, or perhaps even earlier. The age of the Suncult in the Danubian basin itself can be guessed upon the basis of archae ological finds adorned with solar symbols. N u merous such relics have been unearthed since 4000 B.C. D anubian farmers, in particular, carried the spiral, the meander and the other geometrical designs everywhere across Europe (P 064 p. 332). Hungarian archaeologists have brought to light miniature cart-models — Sungod chariots — at seventeen different places, all fitted with discwheels and dated c. 2700 B.C. and 2300 B.C. Sun symbols continued to appear in Hungary, without interruption, during the Copper Age (3500 B.C. — 1900 B.C.) and during the Bronze Age (1900 B.C. — 900 B.C.). And later, when the Rom an Empire ruled in large parts of Hungary, in the first three centuries of the Christian era, a magnif icent Sun-temple was erected in the City of Savaria, the present Szombathely. It was the greatest such tem ple ever built in Europe (16.5 m X 9.5 m), displaying a giant Sun-disc above its altar. All the quoted data prove th a t Sun-worship was a regular feature in the spiritual life of Hungary from the beginning of Neolithic times until the adoption of Christianity. It survived even after that turning-point, as witnessed by the great



dmount of evidence found in folklore, place-names, mythology and history. Concerning the geographical origin of the Danuhian Sun-cult, all our evidence points toward Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Hungarian sci entists working on this specific field, prefer, never theless, to emphasize the primary importance of Mesopotamia (Sumer). To support their view, they cite the numerous concordances existing between the two countries’ mythology, they mention the absolute similarity of the Sumerian and Hungari an names for Sun (Nap), Lord (Ur) and God (Isten) and insist upon the parallels existing be tween the two countries’inhum ation practices. All these concordances, as well as many others are undisputable. Non the less, the concordances be tween Hungary and Ancient Egypt are by far more numerous and far more important. Not only were the general names of the Sungod identical: Ur, Isten, Nap, M addr, but also the specific names: Sky-God {^g Ura), Eye God {Szem-Ur), Travell ing Lord (Ut-Ur), as well. A similarly striking resemblance exists between the priestly class of the two countries, beginning with the generic name Pap ‘Priest’. Egypt had also its Eye-priests (Sempriests) whose ceremonial garment, also of spotted panther skin, was thrown across the shoulders. Egyptian priest, gods and high-ranking officials also often appeared in ornitomorphic garments, as did their Hungarian counterparts who had, at least, one bird-feather fixed upon their heads. The



feast of the reborn Sun (December 25) was cele brated all over Egypt with the same ardour a s in Hungary, and so was the im portant d a te (June 21) of the sum m er solstice. The Sungod’s param ount symbol was, on both occasions, th e shining disc. The burying of the deceased was ju s t as ceremonial in Egypt as in Hungary. The Egyp tians also believed th a t the soul of the deceased departed from the body at the moment of death and flew on wings to his heavenly creator to become his companion for ever. In Egypt the physical remains of the dead person were also put in a grave, accompanied by such objects the de ceased m ay have need for in his new life, which is also similar to Hungarian practice. And in th e ‘house’ of the deceased in Egypt, an opening or shaft had to be made so th at sunbeams could penetrate through it at certain hours of the day. Even a ladder was put into the grave, or at least the picture of a high ladder, to enable the deceased to climb on it and see the Sun. W ithout adding any more to the list of Egypto-Hungarian concor dances, we may conclude by saying th a t H ungary has preserved almost the entire mythological heri tage of Ancient Egypt of the Ilir d and Iln d millenia B.C., even two thousand years after Egypt’s beacon had been extinguished. 5. Traces o f a second religion can also be de tected in H ungary’s folklore. This was the socalled fertihty cult which was totally different from the Suncult. Its purpose was earthly: to



insure fertility both in the hum an and animal worlds. Its central divinity was the M other (loddess whose two main Hungarian names were (ireat Lady (Nagy Asszony) and Happy Lady {Boldog Asszony). Her memory is preserved in anthropomorphic symbols, the so-called Venuses, which are small statuettes representing a naked woman. Ample anthropological evidence suggests th at the fertility cult is as old in Hungary as the Suncult itself. Scholars have, indeed, dug up a considerable number of Venuses dating from the Neohthic Age (3000 B.C. —or even earlier). These figurines are of two kinds: elaborate, ornate anthropomorphic Venuses, and small statuettes of baked clay. A particularly ornate Venus statuette was found on the Neolithic site of Kokeny-Domb, near H6d-Mezo-Vdsarhely which possesses all the characteristics of a Mother Goddess, including her strongly accentuated feminity. Small Venuses were found on almost every excavated Neolithic site. In Mehtelek, however, near the Upper Tisza river, a single place has yielded over sixty such figurines. Amongst these statuettes several were of steatopygous type, indicating the presence of African elements in the population. Comparative archaelogy has established beyond a doubt that the Hungarian fertility cult originat ed in the Eastern Mediterranean, especially Can aan, Syria, Phoenicia and Anatolia, which were the homelands of the Baals, As-Tart, As-Turat,



Kedves, Telepinus and others with clear Hungari an names which seem rather coarse to-day. The fertility cult seems to have been the apanage of the darkish coloured ethnic element whose princi pal lifestyle was stock-breeding, while the Suncult may be attributed to the agricultural, white popu lation.



3. The Oriental background of the first Hungarian dynasty
1. T he origin of the first Hungarian dynasty is shrouded in deep mystery. One thing is however certain, namely that Prince Almus, father of A rpad, was its first great figure. His throne-name, Almus, is a compound-word of two elements: El6 + M asa and signifies ‘Deputy for the Living (God)’, an Oriental title, perfectly suited to de scribe the oflftce Almus held, th a t of the native ruler of the autonomous group of Hungarians, subjects of the Chasar Great-King, the ‘living god’. T h a t Almus was a ruler’s title is confirmed by the additional fact th at the native ruler of the Bulgars, who lived on the shores of the river Volga in c. 921, had an identical throne-name. Further evidence th at Almus was the first im p o rtan t figure of the Hungarian dynasty is his divine origin. In the Ancien Orient, it was indeed a widespread belief th at great kings, especially founders of dynasties, were superhuman beings and were therefore fathered, not by ordinary earthly beings, as the common mortels, but by the Heavenly God. This god was supposed to return to E arth in the shape of a bird, on the very night of the conception of a future sovereign, to impreg nate the expectant mother personally. In ancient Mesopotamia the divine impregnator took the



form of an eagle, called Turullo; in ancient Syria the fertility god was A s-Tur, and in ancient Egypt the Pharaohs were conceived directly by Ra, the Sungod.2'^ The m other of Almus was also visited th at specific night by a divine bird called A stur ( < Az Tur) or Turul ( < Tiir6 L6) ‘Fecundator, Im pregnator’, who foretold th a t from her womb glorious kings would be born.‘^<" Because of their divine origin through the solar bird Turul, the descendants of Almus were known as the Turul progeny.
In addition to the “T urul legend”, the Oriental background of the first Magyar dynasty again becomes visible in the physical features of the first divine infant, Almus. “He was pleasant-faced, but darkish coloured; had big eyes, a tall and slender stature, with big hands and puffy fingers.”-^ The description of Almus’ general appearance baffled scholars ever since, because the Prince resembled
25. “Each time a Pharaoh was conceived, Ra was said to have returned to earth to espouse the queen’ (P 045 p. 50). 26. The corresponding passage by Anonymus reads thus: “matri eius pregnanti per sompnium apparuit divina visio in forma Asturis que quasi veniens earn gravidavit et innotuit ei quod de utero eius egrederetur torrens et de Hmbis eius reges gloriosi propagarentur” (P 120 I p. 38).
27. “erat enim ipse Almus facie decorus sed niger, nigros habebat oculos sed magnos, statura longus et gracilis, manus vero habebat grossas et digitos prolixos" (P 120 I p. 38).



an Egyptian Pharaoh of the late dynastic times much more than the presumed Uralo-Siberian white man. The features of Almus are no longer a problem: on the contrary, they provide further strong evidence of the dynasty’s N ear-Eastern origin.2« In the year 895,when the m ilitary conquest of Hungary was in progress. Prince Almus led the southern wing of the army-group, scheduled to penetrate into the Carpathian basin from the southeast, by way of the Lower Danube. His son, Prince Arpad, headed the northern army-group, which was equipped in Kiev, and was supposed to enter into the selected land through the north eastern pass of Verecke (841 m). Father and son both were to meet inside the Carpathian arc, on the lowland, the military target of their giant pincer-movement. Almus was however unable to complete his task in time due to the unexpected assault of the Petchenegs from behind. For his misfortune, it seems, he was ritually killed by his followers on the outer foothills of the Carpathians. This barbaric custom of eliminating an unsuccess ful leader was another Oriental practice, similar to th at of Biblical Moses who would not see the
28. The grandson of Prince Arpad, Taksony, was of white complexion, while Arpad’s great-grandson took after him: “He had beautiful big eyes and soft dark hair”. Certain kings of the dynasty were of very high stature, as, for example, St. Stephen, King Andras I, St. Ladislas and King B61a III.



promised land, but had to die before he reached his goal to atone for some sin he had committed. 2. A rp a d is the m ost illustrious name in H u n gary’s history. According to records preserved in medieval chronicles, this Prince was a descendant of King Attila, the world-conqueror (+453). His illustrious kinship with him might have been, however, only a distant one, considering th at more than four hundred years separated Arpad from his presumed forebear. Anonymus, the unnamed me dieval historian (c. 1200), when discussing this subject seems to share this view, stating simply th at Prince Almus, father of Arpad, descended from an offspring of King Attila. Be it as it may, the real or fictive kinship with Attila helped Prince Arpad tremendously to consolidate his grip upon the entire central Danubian basin, the future Hungary. He proclaimed indeed, everywhere and repeatedly, th at he was not coming as a vulgar conqueror to create bloodshed, but as the legiti mate successor to his forebear King Attila, to take possession of his heritage. And the inhabitants of the land, hearing this and seeing Arpad’s mighty armies, bowed before their new master. The name Arpad was also a throne-name with a definite meaning. Chronicler Anonymus, the often cited notary of King Bela, spells the name on one occasion thus: ARpad (P 120 I p. 57), with the intent perhaps to warn us th a t the name is a compound, made up of i4r + Pad. If so, he was right, because Ar-Pad follows the pattern of



M at + Ar and Hung + Ar, with the difference th a t in Arpad the composing elements appear in an inverted sequence: Ar-Pat instead of Pad-Ar. Now, (he meaning of Ar is known: ‘Lord, Ruler, Sover eign’; and so is th a t of Pad or Pod (to-day: Fold) ‘E arth, Land’ (after P > F soundshift and the elision of the jammed L in Fold). Accordingly, Arpad means ‘Sovereign R uler of the Land’. Once again, the indication of the Prince’s statu s is exact: it reflects the Chasar king’s policy to gradually promote the Hungarian native ruler to a more independent status. Further light can be shed upon Arpad’s Oriental connections by examining his Near Eastern hom onyms. There was, indeed, a “Kingdom of Arpad” in ancient Syria in the first millenium B.C. It was a city-state located near the great bend of the E uphrates river, some 20 km north-west of Aleppo. Its former site is known today as Erfet (after P > F soundshift), to which an im portant ford on the E uphrates belonged. The Kingdom is men tioned several tim es in the Bible (II Kings c. 18/34 and c. 19/13). Its m ortal enemy was the Semitic Kingdom of Assyria, against whom King M ati’ilus (= Magyar) organized the common defense with the Urartian king Sarduris III. The formidable Assyrian army had to lay a three-year siege around the city before reducing it into submission in 740 B.C. A few years later, the ruler of the kingdom tried to regain his independence, but he failed and his domain was completely obliterated. The popu



lation fled on the only escape route th a t was still open: northwards, through the Euphrates valley, to settle beyond the Caucasus m ountains. All these tragic events m ust have been linked some how with the emergence of a Caucasian Hungarian Kingdom, proof of which is th a t in both areas in Syria and in the Caucasus — Magyar placenames are to found in super-abundant numbers. Regarding the throne-nam e Arpad, it goes back into history even farther. The ancient Egyptians revered, e.g. a ruler of th a t name as their very first king.--' The name Arpad or E rpet is mentioned several times in the Egyptian “Book of the Dead” (P 027 pp. 18, 138, 435 and 649). It was again an Arpad who, after having reunited the desintegrated country, assumed the royal dignity in Thebes and founded the X lth Dynasty (P 025 II p. 196 and f., see hieroglyphs ibidem). Due to the great role Arpad played in ancient Egypt, Prof. Gar diner and W. Budge made extensive researches to find out more about this legendary name. They concluded th a t it was wi-itten with four soundsigns as AR-P-A-T or AR-P-A-D, followed by two determinatives. The first one was th a t of ‘Cloth, E arth, Land’, and the second, a hum an figure, indicating th a t the person so named was a greatman. Thus the Egyptian name Ar-Pad meant
29. Prof. Gardiner states that the Egyptian Arpad may have been “perhaps the first to become ruler upon earth over the autochthonous Egyptians, after whom fol lowed Osiris and the Horus” (P 052 p. *110).



literally ‘Land Lord’, i.e. owner of an im portant .ifiricultural domain somewhere along the fertile shore of the river Nile.'*'* When the determinatives were om itted, as was usually the case in wellknown names, the expression became a simple name. These data prove th a t ‘Arpad’ was a very ancient royal title and th at its bearers had so journed a t length in Syria and especially in Egypt, before entering into Danubian Hungary.^i
3. How were the titles o f the H ungarian kings written pictorially? It was done with the figure of a Hon, because the name of this animal, OroszIdn, sounded like the expression Ur-Os-Leny ‘Pri meval Being of Divine Origin’. The earliest extant lion symbol used by the Arpad dynasty in Hungary was the one carved upon the crystal globe of the coronation sceptre, originating from the X th cen tury. According to archaeologists, the crystal in

If the Sumerian name for Earth was also Pat, Pot, the Sumerian ruler’s title Pat-Esi (= H. Fold Ose) also meant ‘Land Ancestor’ or ‘Land Lord’. 31. Many rulers of the Hungarian Arpad dynasty had throne-names with a clear Oriental meaning, and this explains why certain names appear so often, like Istvan (five times) and Bela (four times). In the Old Hungarian spelling Istvin or Estdn was the word for Isten ‘God’. Bela (in O.H. Bala, Baal, Bika) was the Syrian name for Great-God. They were used in an abridged form, all bearing testimony that their wearers were ‘Living Gods’, i.e. Gods on Earth, exactly as was the practice in the Ancient Orient.



question is of Egyptian origin, this being the only country where it is found (P 003 p. 59, 62). A more elaborate lion-symbol was found painted on an interior wall of the royal palace in Esztergom, built in the X llth century. It could be reconstructed into its original form with what remained of its former parts (Fig. 21). O ther lions kept close guard before an interior well of the royal palace of Visegrad (XVth century). Furthermore, the seven sovereign Magyar princes who elected Arpad to be their ruler and commander, also had lions on their coats of arms. The custom of representing royalties by lions also goes back to Mesopotamia, Egypt and India, as mentioned before. In Mesopo tamia, the lion had already been the royal symbol of Gilgamesh, the legendary ruler of Uruk, who was usually shown with a lion cub. In Egypt, the lion was the regular companion of the kings and farther east, in India, it was particularly in evi dence during the Maury (= Magyar) dynasty. These kings erected huge columns with lions placed on top throughout their vast domain. Thus, there can be no doubt as to the origin and meaning of the lion symbol which clearly indicates the Oriental background of the Arpad dynasty.
The Arpadian coat of arms had seven horizontal stripes, four red and three white. It perpetuated the memory of the Seven Magyar Princes who concluded a contract of m utual blood-relationship to henceforth form a single nation. The stripes, in horizontal arrangement, signify, in the old



I'lu.vptian hieroglyphic system, as m any ‘Land L o rd s’, H on-ur (Aner). Thus the seven stripes nu an H H H onur ‘Seven Land Lords’. The num ber se ven was considered the lucky num ber all over Ihe Ancient Near East. In addition to the striped (Scutcheon, Hungarian kings used a second shield as well, consisting of a double cross rising from a three-arched base. When these elements are read according to the rules of the carved script, the following word emerges: the double cross carries the syllable eGY, one arch is the sign for the Sh sound, three arches signal the plural case: Sh.ek, and these sounds, put together, form the word egy-esh.ek, i.e. Egyezseg, meaning ‘Agreement, Pact, Alhance’, which is another reference to the contract of blood-relationship.^^ The stripes and the double cross were later placed upon a single shield, which was divided into two halves by a vertical line. Thus, the shield conveys the follow ing meaning to us: H et H onur egyezsege ‘Agree
32. Babylon was surrounded by seven walls; the Mesopota mian Ziggurat had seven floors; Mesopotamian noble men wore seven ruffled kilts; Egypt had seven great gods; the Egyptian Heaven had seven divisions; the Hittite Empire (the Biblical H6th) started with the fusion of seven lands; the Etruscan nation began with the federa tion of seven cities; Rome was built on seven hills; etc. etc. 33. According to Prof. Aldasy, the double-cross cannot be considered an apostolic cross; this latter was always a single cross (P 001 p. 63). Thus, he indirectly admits the pre-Christian origin of this important symbol.



m ent of Seven Princes’. This combined figure became H ungary’s heraldical symbol until it was officially discarded by the communist regime. At first, Hungary, had two royal crowns, a Corona Graeca and a Corona Latina, so named after their respective origin. A few centuries later, the two crowns were welded together, to form a single one. There is no plausible explanation for this act, says Prof. Aldasy, a leading authority in Hungarian heraldry. The mystery may, however, be solved since a similar event had taken place in ancient Egypt. Originally, there were two crowns in this country, one for Upper and another for Lower Egypt. And when the two lands were reunited into a single domain, and the fusion of the two states had reached an advanced stage, the two crowns were reunited into one. It is possible th at the fusion of the Hungarian crowns may have been prompted by this or by some other similar event. Through the various facets of the first Hungari an dynasty (1000-1301) which we analyzed, we were led to the conclusion th a t this dynasty was deeply imbued with Oriental thinking. A n d what regards the founder of this dynasty, Prince Arpad, there cannot be the slightest doubt that he de scended from a long line of ruling families, experi enced in leadership.



1. How the Nation remembered its origin
Most of the existing traditions relating to the origin of the Hungarians have been recorded dur ing the X n ith and X lV th centuries. These written .u counts, called Gesta (deeds of valour) or Chron icles (annals) are continuous narratives, usually in the Latin language, reflecting a religious and patriotic spirit.^^ The earliest and most valuable Gesta Hungarorum was written by the unnamed (Anonymus) notary of King Bela, between 1196 and 1203. The author, a former student a t Paris Uni versity, served in the royal Hungarian Chancel lery, and was later elevated to the rank of bishop. The topic of his work is the successful re-conquest of the Middle Danube basin by Prince Arpad, leader of the Magyar tribal confederation at the end of the IXth century. The next important national chronicle was written in c. 1282 by Magister Sim on de K eza (‘Kezai’in H ungarian), court chaplain of King Ladislas IV (1272-1299) a ruler with avowed heathen leanings. The freer atm o sphere prevailing in the king’s court perm itted Kezai to devote a large part of his book to the old fatherland and to assert the identity of the Magyars and Huns, regarding Attila as a Magyar

king. Therefore, in his view, the advent of Prince Arpad and his followers in 895 appears as the “second entry” of Hungarians into the chosen land. After Anonymus and Kezai, several other national chronicles were written, one of the most eminent having been the admirably illustrated Chronicon Pictum (c. 1385). There is also a Tarih-i Ungurus (History of Hungarians), translated into Turkish from an unknown Latin original, after 1543. W hat the chronicles knew about the Hungari ans’ ancient history is briefly summarized on the following pages, namely: (1) the genesis of the people, (2) the geographic location of the old fatherland, and (3) their migration toward the West. Both Anonymus and Kezai were convinced th at the Magyars are an ancient people, originat ing right after the Flood, when all hum an beings were drowned, except a single family: th at of Noah. They assert th at the early Magyars were the direct descendants of two sons of Noah: Japhet and Cham. Those who recorded the descent from Japhet claimed th at Magog, the first king of Scythia, was the namegiver of the Magyars.'^"’ The scholars holding the second version say th at the Magyars originated from Kush (Cush), the dark complexioned offspring of Cham. While studying
35. “Et primus rex Scythiae fuit Magog filius Japhet, et gens ilia a Magog rege vocata est Moger”, — writes Anonymus (P 120 I p. 35).



(he contradictory versions of the Magyars’ ethnic origin, later chroniclers stressed their own case more emphatically. The advocates of the Japhetist descent underscore the fact th at the Hungarians, being white, could not have originated from Kush, who was a dark coloured man.^*5 A similar controversy arose about the brothers Hunor and Magyar, the direct forefathers of all Huns and all Magyars. At one time they were said to have been the children of Menrot, the giant (an E g y p tian ?),w h o was a descendant of Japhet (the white) through Tana; and at another, as the sons of Nemroth (Nimrod), a Babylonian, de scendant of Kush (the dark). The chroniclers did not consider the possibihty of a dual origin of the Nation, according to which the main branch, the agriculturist white Magyars, would have absorbed a notable number of dark-complexioned, mainly pastoral elements in the earliest phase of their formation. The fusion of the said two ethnic ele
36. On these conflicting views see, particularly, the Chronicon Pictum (P 120 I pp. 243-250, and the Hungarian translation: P 053 pp. 35-37).
37. No Hungarian historian has taken notice until now that Egyptian literature also know of a hunting hero, Onuris by name (like the Hungarian Hunor), who had a mate called Mehit, ‘lioness’. See the somewhat confused pas sage in P 032 p. 227, which reads: “His (Onuris’) cult figure was a man wearing a long skirt, his feet poised well apart, to enable him to aim a spear downwards at some monstrous foe. His worship was centred in Thinis, a district which also included Abydos.” The Coffin Texts, III 334 j. are given as reference.



m ents was first ascertained only later by Deseritzky (P 092 p. 179). Disregarding the above differences, there exists a general agreement amongst our medieval historians that the H un garians were a very ancient people and the Scyth ians and Huns were closely related to them and spoke the same language.
Where was the Old Fatherland located? Some where in the “Hot Zone” (torrida zona), “where the climate is not tem perate and where snakes of all kinds, frogs as large as small pigs (= tortoises), basilisks, many venomous animals, also tigers and rhinoceroses are to be found.” T hat was a land where great quantities of gold and silver were mined and many pearls discovered. It is unfortu nate th a t the chroniclers did not elaborate and th a t they om itted to give the name and the precise location of this country. In the absence of preci sion, we can only rely upon conjectures, conclud ing th a t the description given fits best to the region west of the Red Sea, the S-form bend of the Nile where ancient Nubia and Magaria were situated. There were the famous gold fields, wherefrom the Egyptian Pharaohs obtained their enormous gold supply and where all the tropical animals men tioned are common. Giant tortoises are the typical creatures abounding in the Red Sea.-^'^
38. The original wording is thus: ‘Ubi propter intemperiem illius zonae sunt serpentes diversi generis, ranae velut porci, basilisci, et plura animalia toxicata; tigris et unicornis ibi generantur.” Where gold, silver and pearls



There are indications in the national chronicles which suggest th at a second old Hungarian father land may have existed, south of the Caucasus, extending to the Mediterranean and including Syria, C anaan and Asia M inor as well. It was in this same area th at the H ittite Empire had come into being, called the ‘Land of Seven’, because it started with the unification of seven provinces governed by as many princes. The chronicles men tion th at the same region has been an old Hungar ian fatherland. In fact, the chronicles say th at “the sons of Japhet/from whom the bulk of Hungarians originated/owned the northern region in Cilicia and Syria, extending from the Taurus and Amanus mountains to the river Don, which is already in Scythia” (P 120 I p. 243 f.). We even have certain evidence of the existence of a third Hungarian homeland which was situated in the hinterland of the Babylonian Empire and included Upper Mesopotamia and Caucasia. Our chroniclers be lieve th a t Nimrod (Nemproth) was the first ruler of Babylon. The making and the breaking-up of old Hungar ian fatherlands was usually accompanied by vast ethnic movements or ‘migrations'. Their direction was mostly northward and westward. In the na tional recollection, the earliest recorded migration started in the desert region of Dancalia (today:

Danakil), between Somalia and Eritrea, and pro ceeded northwards, bypassed Memphis and Baby lon (today: Old Cairo) and stopped for a while in Eiulath, a t the end of the Gulf of Aqaba (P 088 p. 17; P 120 I pp. 143-145; P 014 p. 167). The two hunting heroes, Hunor and Magyar, who happened to be born in Eiulath, later crossed the Caucasus and entered Scythia at the Marshes of Maeotis (the present day Azov peninsula). The Magyar chronicles are, of course, primarily interested in the ethnic groups which moved wes twards and eventually reached Hungary. One such migration started from Troy in Asia M inor and went throught the Balkan peninsula. It was the people of Priamos, the last king of Troy, who went th a t way after the fall of their city-state in c. 1260 B.C. They settled in Hungary, near the great southward bend of the Danube, where they built a stronghold called Sicambria. They remained in the country for about four hundred years, when many of them moved over to France, settling in the Paris region. They had fled in panic fearing th at other Oriental nations were already on their way to the Danube basin (P 120 I p. 245). The chronicle writers had preserved more details on a second overland route, leading from the Orient to Hungary. It ran above the Black Sea, through a large and open country called Scythia (the present southern Russia). Although Scythia’s climate was a healthy one and favourable for the propagation of a human race, it was nevertheless



.oiisidered as a transit country only. This land \\ as, indeed, overcrowded with various peoples and had become more and more insecure. As is known, Ilie Hun-Hungarians were the first great group to set out from there, marched westwards and were successful in establishing a new empire in Central lOurope, with its capital in Hungary, near the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Maros. After (he collapse of their rule, they were followed by the Magyar-Hungarians, whose group first con centrated in the Lower Don region, called DentuMoger by Anonymus. Chronicler Kezai enlarges the territory of the H ungarians in Scythia consid erably, insofar as he includes the Touranian Low land around the Aral Sea and the Oxus river into it, which he calls Magoria.
In short, these are the outlines of the image the Hungarians kept alive in their collective memory of their origin, old fatherland, and wanderings. We must feel a certain admiration when studying their records, all the more so since modern histori cal science appears generally to support their claims.

PART TWO
THE GENESIS OF THE DANUBIAN HUNGARIANS



I'HE NEOLITHIC AND BRONZE AGE HUNGARIANS
I. Implantation o f the Higher Civilization into the Danubian basin
1. “Higher Civilization” is the comprehensive i< rm for the m ajor m aterial and spiritual innova tions made by man during the Neolithic and Uronze Ages. It signifies a settled way of life ( haracterized by food-production through agricullural activity and stock-breeding. In view of th e scarcity or total absence of contemporary w ritten evidences, this early period of hum an life is usually reconstructed with the help of its material re mains, whose study is archaeology. In the follow ing account, we frequently use another scientific term as well, which is “historical Hungary”. It means the unitary area of Central Europe which is bounded on three sides —north, east and so u th east —by the Carpathian m ountain ranges, in th e south by the Low Danube and the river Sava, an d to the west by the first elevations of the Alps (Fig. 1). After its principal mountain-range a n d principal river, it is also known as the “C arpathian Land” and “Middle Danube basin”, or, more p re cisely, the “Carpatho-Danubian area”. For over a thousand years (until 1920), this area form ed a single political entity, the Kingdom of Hungary.



‘Historical H ungary’ is rich in archaeological remains. The most significant finds which were made there until the mid-fifties, have been de scribed by E dith B. Thom as in her German lan guage A rc/iaeo/o^/sc/ie Funde in Ungarn (P 125). Since th a t time the soil has yielded so much valuable new material th at this basic work needed to be completed. The two most im portant comple mentary publications are from Nandor Kalicz: Archaeology of the Neolithic and Bronze Ages in Hungary, in H ungarian (P 074) and Neolithic Finds at M ehtelek (also in H., P 075). The inter national connections of the Hungarian New Stone Age have first been recognized by Gordon Childe in his fundam ental work The Danube in Prehistory (P 031), while the great role the Middle Danube area played in spreading Higher Civilization wes tward, has been summarized by Jacquetta Hawkes in several of her comprehensive studies (P 064; P 065 and P 066). The excellent maps of H. T. W aterbolk (P 134), showing the diffusion of food-production-methods, especially into Europe, are indispensable even for the student of Hungari an archaeology. These publications may give the reader a perfectly clear idea and up-to-date infor mation about the various archaeological aspects of early Hungary. 2. Neolithic agriculture found very favourable conditions in Hungary, where it flourished rapidly, especially on the great Central Plain and where mighty rivers — the Danube, Tisza, Maros and



Koros — assure abundant year-round water sup ply. Moreover, Hungary has extensive loess soil, which is easily handled, even with primitive imple ments, because it consists of very minute, windblown particles of high capillarity. In addition to agriculture, breeding of domestic animals (cat tle, sheep, pigs, goats and dogs) played an impor tan t part in early food-production. In this regard, a long-horned, Oriental cattle-race deserves special mention because their descendants can be admired even today in the Hortobagy National Park near Debrecen. Manufacturing of pottery, spinning and weaving were the most im portant industrial activ ities. Large vases were made for storage purposes, smaller ones for every-day use, while ceramic statuettes and other artistic products satisfied the needs of the Church. Timbered houses above the ground and small, self-sufficient villages, as well as incipient writing completed the Neolithic way of life in early Hungary. There are over 200 known sites th a t bear testi mony of the material remains of Hungarian Higher Civilization. All were located on virgin soil, i.e. they form the oldest layer in excavated sites. This is an im portant fact because it indicates th a t there is no trace of previous more primitive food-production in the Carpatho-Danubian area. There, the Neolithic appears unprecedented and suddenly, in a fully developed form. Consequently, this was not a phenomenon of local origin but was caused by immigrants coming from another region.



The Neolithic Age began in Hungary in the fifth millenium B.C. It first appeared along the Koros river, in the central part of the Great Plain, hence its name: Kdros culture. It remained the dominant neohthic group for a period of over a thousand and five hundred years, until about 3200 B.C. and has left lasting marks upon all subsequent, similar Danubian cultures. The most sensational remains of the Koros culture have come to light at Mehtelek in 1973. This tiny village is in the Upper Szamos valley in an isolated location: about 200 km away from the centre of this culture. This unique loca tion is explained by the presence of enormous quantities of obsidian, a very precious industrial m aterial during th at epoch, for whose exploitation a whole colony was set up. In order to fathom how im portant this exploitation was, it is signifi cant th a t the five pits which were open so far by archaeologists yielded several thousand raw lumps and finished wares, as compared with barely a hundred which were previously inventoried for all of Hungary. Another surprise: nearly sixty Venusstatuettes were dug out in th at area, as compared with a total of forty th at were previously discov ered. No other such rich obsidian centre has ever been found elsewhere in Europe (P 096 and P 075). During the era of the Koros culture, Transdanubia and Upper Hungary were covered with an other neolithic culture, the so-called Danube-I, radiocarbon-dated c. 4430 B.C. From its decorated pottery, it is also known as Linear Pottery Culture,



i>i liandkeram ik and its preference for loess soil IS particularly visible. A third m ajor Hungarian neolithic culture was the B anatian culture (c. 3200 n.(".-2300 B.C.), which included the Transylvanian ( )lt basin (Erosd) and formed a link with the more t‘xtensive Tripolje culture in E astern Europe, famous for its painted pottery. The fourth was (he Tisza culture (c. 2800 B.C.-c. 2500 B.C.) which produced the finest and most valuable pottery. 'The fifth or last one was the Peceli culture (c. 2100 B.C.-1900 B.C.). It already covered the whole territory of Hungary and the Vienna and Mora vian basins as well. H ungary’s five neolithic cultures cover an unin terrupted period of over two millenia and show a surprisingly high degree of uniformity over the whole area. They have successfully incorporated almost all the material and spiritual innovations of the world’s first H igher Civilization which flourished in the Ancient Near East, and became a secondary centre of diffusion for the benefit of all central and north-western Europe?^
39. This is the opinion of many international authorities, like C. Dawson who writes this: “It is certainly in the Danubian region that we find (in Europe) the most complete and typical example of any early peasant culture” (P 039 p. 53). And H. T. Waterbolk: “(Toward 3000 B.C.), the Hungarian Plain was a dominant centre which had incorporated all the major achievements of the nuclear area in the Near East and which had added to these an adaptation to the European deciduous forest” (P 134).



3. M etal-using cultures appeared in Hungary in the middle of the Ilird millenium. The first period, from c. 2500 B.C., is characterized by an abundant use of copper and gold; the second, from c. 1900 to 800 B.C. by its preference for bronze. Hungarian archaeologists therefore like to speak of separate Copper and Bronze Ages, yet the two periods constitute but a single one, bronze being an alloy of 90% copper with 10% tin or antim ony. T h at Hungary was capable of developing a brilliant metallurgy before any other European country is due to the rich copper mines in her mountains, and the abundance of alluvial gold deposited in the tributary streams of the Tisza. A good illustration of H ungary’s richness in precious m etals a t th a t time is the gold plate of Mojgrad in Szilagy county (Fig. 25). It weighs 750 gr and reflects a neolithic pattern, insofar as only the eyes and the nose are represented on it, while the m outh is omitted. The plate was, in all probability, a sacred object whose brilliant face represented the Sungod. It may have been the identification plate of a high priest when officiat ing. The most distinctive H ungarian product was, however, the hammer-axe, with a disc for the butt (Fig. 26). It was a native form, derived from an earlier copper shaft-hole axe, this last being the derivative of a stone axe. The metallurgic centres of Hungary were so productive th a t they literally inundated contemporary markets with their dag gers, swords, spears, arrow-heads, goblets and



l)iacelets. The proper evaluation of H ungary’s metallurgical activities, both in the Copper and Bronze Ages, can be derived from Prof. Dawson’s remarks, who summed up his findings thus: “It is clear th a t during this period Hungary was the centre of a brilliant development of culture which, from the artistic point of view, surpassed anything that existed elsewhere in Central Europe... The splendid Hungarian swords and axes, often orna mented with elaborate spiral decorations, are perhaps the finest specimens of European bronze work, and supplied the models for similar types of the Nordic Bronze A ge” (P 039 p. 326).

4. As already pointed out, the neolithic way of life was not indigenous to Hungary, but came from an outside geographic area. According to our present knowledge, this can but be the Ancient Near-East, where all the wild ancestors of domes ticated plants and animals were present and where



food-production was achieved at an earlier date. The accuracy of this fact has subsequently been proven with comparative archaeology. Scholars of th at study discovered, indeed, a strong affinity, both in form and style, between the earliest H un garian artefacts and their Oriental counterparts. It was, in particular, noticed th at the Hungarian axes strongly resembled those found in the Royal Cemetery of Ur, th at Transylvanian sickles origin ated from Mesopotamian forms and th at the ol dest Hungarian pottery was similar to th at found in the oldest layers of the ruins of Ur, Kish, Assur and other ancient cities of Mesopotamia. Concor dances found in the Nile valley were just as convincing: long-horned Egyptian cattle, native of the Delta, survives 3000 years later in the H ungar ian National Park of Hortobagy. In the same park, specimens can be seen of a special breed of sheep with twisted horns, spread horizontally a t an angle of about 120 degrees, now called Racka. In ancient Egypt these sheep were sacred to the God Khum, the ram-headed divinity. This race has since be come extinct there. In the grave of King Hasekhemui of the Second D ynasty (c. 2703 B.C.-2686 B.C.) a gold object was found, whose m aterial may originally have come from Hungary. It is indeed covered with a thin layer of antimony (Sb) and tellurium (Te) which occur only in the gold of the Carpathian basin. Another proof of the ancient Egypto-Hungarian connections is the splendid jar found in Egyed, in Sopron county. The God T hot



recording the sins of the deceased is depicted on its sides. The civihzation of the ancient Near-East em braced not only Mesopotamia and Egypt, which we ju st mentioned, bu t Syria and AnatoHa as well, with which countries the Carpatho-Danubian re gion was already directly connected. Such contacts were numerous, as shown by two enormous rapiers, over 90 cm in length, which were found in the heart of Transylvania. They correspond exactly to the so-called Shardina-sword from Palestine (now in the British Museum). There were also bracelets and beads made from M editerranean shells. More over, certain idols of Hungary are the exact duplicates of those found on the Island of Cyprus (Elet <\s Tudomdny, 1974 no. 38). The Boghaz-Koi (Hittite) pottery designs from the X lV th century B.C. had their duplicates in the Maros valley in H un gary. Hungarian gourd-shaped vessels were like Cappadocian specimens, while Hungarian bronze jars found in Ozd near Miskolc, and elsewhere, were similar to their Trojan prototypes from around 2100 B.C. And the gold plate from Mojgrad shows a close resemblance to a similar figure from Troy n. Thus Higher Civilization from the Orient reached Hungary overland, through the Balkan corridor formed by the narrow valleys of the Vardar and Morava rivers. This route was in use Ibr over two thousand years and its importance only began to decline after the fall of Troy H,



c. 1200 B.C. The route has been practically closed since the V llth century B.C. In spite of the close links with its Oriental model, the Higher Civilization of Hungary was not a simple copy of it, since it could boast of several original features. One of the most im portant of these was dry-farming. As a m atter of fact, the Hungarian rivers, unlike those of Mesopotamia and Egypt, had no regular floods. Therefore,- pro duction by irrigation was not practised to a great extent here. Instead, the Danubian farmers select ed the windblown, porous loess soil for cultivation, after having cleared it of its small growth. Later, with the appearance of metallic tools and other more efficacious agricultural implements (plough), it was possible to include heavier but better clay soil as well into the cultivated area. T hanks to this and to similar inventions, Danubian farmers were highly superior in production to those on the Balkans, including Greece. The adaptation to E u ropean environment was a significant innovation; it opened the door for Hungarian farmers to spread out westwards, into Central and Western Europe.
Besides the Danubian Neolithic, early Europe possessed two other neolithic cultures: the Tripolje or Black Earth culture, with its painted pottery, and the Lake Dwelling culture in Switzer land. The first one unfolded in Eastern Europe, between the Dnieper and the Low Danube. Its exact origin is still unknown, although it is certain



that it owed its existence to the same source th at gave rise to the Danubian neohthic civilization. The Tripolje culture disappeared, however, quite soon after the so-called Battle-axe people ap peared, whereas the Lake DwelHng, on account of its very special conditions, could not be intro duced elsewhere. As a result, the Hungarian or Danubian neolithic culture remained without rival in central and western Europe. This privileged situation explains its lasting influence over vast areas for about two thousand years. The westward extension of the Danubian civilization proceeded along the Danube and its interconnections on the one hand, and along the Vistula and Oder on the other. In the words of Prof. G. Childe: "for over two thousand years it (the Danube) formed the channel by which the influence of the Higher Civilization of the Eastern M editerranean basin, including A natolia and Syria, was transm itted to the barbarian North and even to distant Britain” (P 073 p. 413).^<'

2. The advent o f the first sedentary population
1. In the two thousand years immediately pre ceding the Neolithic Age from c. 5500 B.C. to 3500 B.C., neither the Middle Danube basin nor Central Europe in general had any permanent population (P 134). This fact excludes the possibiUty th a t the Danubian cultural and technical upswing might have been the result of borrowing through com mercial contacts, no one being present at the receiving end. It is therefore generally assumed that the introduction of the Higher Civihzation in the Carpatho-Danubian area was the work of actual colonization by immigrant farmers and metal workers. In fact, the first colonists began to reach H un gary immediately after the climatic change, in the so-called Subboreal Period. During th at period the average rainfall was less than today, and th e yearly tem perature was 7°C above the present average. With the increasing dryness, dense forests thinned out, marshes shrank to a smaller size or even disappeared, more room becoming available for ethnic movements. The Vardar-Morava corri dor, which cuts the Balkans right in half, opened up and funnelled migrant groups of cultivators and herdsmen in an ever increasing number into H un



(Mi y. The bulk o f migrants came from the western parts of the Ancient Near East: from Syria and .\ natolia, although the originalpoint of departure i)f m any o f them was M esopotamia and Egypt. The described ethnic movement can best be Ibllowed with the study of old place-names, the ■toponymy’. Its usefulness for detecting ethnic movements stems from the general human beha viour th a t immigrants, as soon as they settle in a free place, give names to the surrounding geot^raphic features. When correctly interpreted, these names may disclose the geographic origin of the first colonists, the time of their arrival, the state of their civilization, their language, their ethnic appurtenance, and even the area of coloni zation in the new land. For all these advantages, toponymy has become one of the most productive subsidiary branches of history; it may open “daz zling perspectives,” —as the French linguist Albert D auzat expressed it (P 037 p. 70). The historical interpretation of place-names needs, however, a very careful analysis, because they were them selves subject to phonetical distortions, following the various sound-shifts, the vowel harmony and the shifting of accent. Therefore the first task of the toponymist consists of elucidating the oldest spelling of a given place-name, which usually conserves the original meaning of the name most clearly. In this respect, however, the effective contribution of Hungarian Hnguists to our knowl edge in this particular field was, until recently



inadequate, due to their rather conservative frame of mind (cf. P 009 p. 56 f.). Under these circum stances, this author had to supply the basic docu m entation for this chapter. 2. A first group of H ungarian place-names, throwing hght upon the geographic origin of her inhabitants, includes such names that are identi cal to those of their previous dwelling places. The immigrants, indeed, make use of the same vocabu lary in christening, to which they were accus tomed. This habit is verifiable even in our days, and it explains why we have so many ‘London’, ‘Paris’, ‘A thens’ and other European names in America, duplicating the toponymy of their former country. In a similar way, there is, in Hungary, a series of place-names which are repetitive to those of Anatolia, Syria, Mesopotamia and Egypt. Let us quote a few such names. First, the name of Troy (anc. Turia), in western Anatolia, also occurs in Hungary as Torja and Tiirje. The name of A rzaw a in southern Anatolia is dupHcated in southern Hungary as Orsova. The Phoenician city of A ra d has its Hungarian namesake in the great city of Arad. Two Hungarian villages called Haldp (located in the counties of Zala and Bihar) corre spond to the im portant city of Haleb (today: Aleppo). The Syrian B ukk valley has its namesake in Hungary in the Biikk mountain and Biikk town. The Palestinian Pilis country or Pilis-Ta is identi cal to the Hungarian Pilis name, used as a county, mountain and village name. The Palestinian river



Kishont also re-appears in Hungary in the same form as Kishont, a county-name. The list of similar place-names continues with Egyptian and Mesopotamian names. Ancien Egypt had a border-land called Zala or Sala. It was a marshy region in the north-eastern Delta, where a fortress was located to guard the military road to Syria. The same name occurs in Hungary, in both forms as Zala and Sala, a county which formerly resembled a marshy border-land in its southern parts. Egypt’s N itra is duplicated in Hungary with Nyitra (anc. Nitra) as a county, city and river name. The southern part of the Sinai peninsula, under Egyptian rule since the unifica tion of the “Two Lands” in c. 3200 B.C., was known as Bakon', its Hungarian homonym is also Bakony, a forested area to the northwest of the Balaton Lake. Even Egyptian king-names were used as H ungarian place-names, so th a t Tata, Papa and Menes are Tata, Papa, Menes, Menfo, Menfa.
There are several duplicates of the Mesopota mian river names in Hungary. E. g. K herka and Sajur, both tributaries of the Tigris, appear in Hungary as Kerka and Sajo. The Mesopotamian native name of the land beyond the river Euphrates was Burattu; its Hungarian equivalent is Berettyo. The Hungarian Karas, Koros and Krasso correspond to the Mesopotamian Karasu. Finally, northern Mesopotamia was called Subaru and Subartu to which the Hungarian Szabar village-names in the Vas, Gyor and N6grad coun



ties correspond, as well as Sabaria, the capital city of former Pannonia. Such parallels are not merely coincidental, since certain Arab historical sources mention th at the Hungarians were for merly called by the ethnic name SabartoiAsphaloi.
A second series of Near-Eastern — Hungarian common place-names are those th at contain the name of an Oriental pagan divinity. We have already mentioned some of them in a previous chapter dealing with mythology. So it suffices here to remind the reader th at the most frequent divine names in question are the Sungod’s various names, such as ‘lord’ {Ur, Ra)\ ‘Eye God’ (Szemes); ‘Sky God’ i^g-U r); ‘The E nthroned God’ {Szek-Ur); ‘Heavenly Horse’ Ld). The second popular pagan divinity whose name is used in Hungarian place-names is B dl (Baal), the Syrian Fire God. Places bearing the name of this god are most frequent in the southern half of the country, in the Balaton Lake area and in Transylvania. This regrouping suggests th at the Baal-worshipping colonists may have arrived after the Sun-worshippers. The third most frequently occurring divinity name was that of the God Thot, protector of arts and letters in Egypt. Finally, a third series of Hungarian place-names of Near Eastern origin are those which are formed with Oriental ethnic or tribal names. These are e.g. H etes or Metis, m ean ing ‘Seven Ancestors’ and Heteny, recalling the descendants of the Hittites, who were led by



exactly seven (Heth) princes. Another Oriental ethnic name is Pilis, which was already mentioned. These three series of specific Hungarian placenames — duplicating names, divine names and i’thnic names —prove th a t ancient H ungary re ceived the greater part of its first permanent population from the Ancient Near East during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. The first wave was made up mostly of agriculturists coming into the Carpatho-Danubian area through the Balkan corridor of the Vardar-Morava valleys.
3. Having clarified the geographic origin of H ungary’s first sedentary population, our a tte n tion will be focussed next upon their territorial expansion in the land. Our research in this con nection is based partly upon the three series of place-names just discussed, and partly upon placenames which include one of the following six Old Hungarian formative suffixes denoting dwelling places: 1. Ta (variant: Da) meaning ‘L and’; 2. H on (var. On, An, O ny) ‘Home’; 3. Szek (var. Szeg, Szik) ‘Residence’; 4. Ko (var. Ka, Ke, Kev) literally ‘Stone’, also ‘Village’; 5. Pis (> B iz, Viz) ‘W ater’; and 6. M a t (var. Ma, Mad, M ata) ‘Field’. Proof of the great antiquity of these six formative suf fixes is the fact th a t today they are no longer used for name-giving purposes, th at they are common in the entire Finno-Ugric language group and that the words in question were in continuous use in the Ancient Orient since the H lrd millenium B.C. at least.



We begin our illustration with the word Ta. It occurs in the following Near Eastern place-names; Pilis-Ta, Heti-Ta, Cre-Ta, Kushi-Ta, Subar-Tu, Urar-Tu, etc. In European Hungary the following names are formed with the same element; Ago-Ta, Bago-Ta, Bak-Ta, B6-Ta, Bucsu-Ta, Cinko-Ta, Csaj-Ta, Csasz-Ta, Galdn-Ta, Ino-Ta, Kadar-Ta, Kalo-Ta, Laj-Ta, Panko-Ta, Pilis-Ta, Pusz-Ta; further; Ab-Da, An-Da, Or-Da, Ra-Da, Tor-Da, Vdr-Da. The suffix Hon (frequently w ithout the first letter, H) was also common in place-names both in the Near E ast as well as in Hungary. In the Orient the most widely known such names are; Ir-An (<Ur-H on), Tour-An (<T6-Ur-Hon), Makr-An (<M agyar Hon), and Macar-On (= Magyar Hon); and in Hungary; Bak-On, BakOny, Balat-On (<B al-O tt-H on), Mos-Ony, etc. Place-names to which the formative suffix Szek is added are; Bakony-Szeg, Bata-Szek, Bor-Szek, Biikk-Szek, Eger-Szeg (< E g Ur Szeke), E-Szek (< 0-Szek), Feher-Szek, Harom-Szek, Kis-Szek, Ko-Szeg, Rona-Szek, Szi-Szek, and Szek-Acs, Szek-Szard, etc. With Ko: Barat-Ka, Szabad-Ka, Pat-Ka, Dobo-Ka, Raj-Ka, Resz-Ke (< Rez-Ko), Pisz-Ke, Bel-K6, Ko-Szeg. Names with Pis: Danu-Bis, Ti-Bis, Cola-Pis (the medieval form of the present Kulpa), Fischa (< Pis); and the dwell ing names Pis-Ki, Pis-Ko, Pis-Karos, Pisz-Ke, Pozsony (< Pis-Hon), Pos-Tyen. And finally placenames in Hungary with Mat: Doz-Mat, Dai-M at, Ko-Madi, Kecske-Met, Madi, Mata, Modor.



After having selected, by the above-mentioned method, all the eligible place-names of Oriental origin — over 2,000 names — from the Directory of H ungarian place-names (P 094 and P 095), and located on a m ap showing the 63 counties of Hungary, the following statistics emerged:

** Our data relating to the counties between the rivers Driivji iiiid S/.iiV!i an- incotnplcti-.



The results of the above statistics have been illustrated on a m ap (Fig. 27), including the eight counties between the rivers Drava and Sava. Marked with squares are the most densely settled counties, i.e. in which a t least 45 Old Hungarian place-names have been found. The less densely populated areas are marked with dotted lines, i.e. counties having a t least 30, but not more than 44 Old Hungarian place-names, while the sparsely populated counties, with less th an 30 old placenames, are left in white. This precious map, issued as a result of a minute inquiry, reveals th at the first permanent popula tion of the Carpatho-Danubian basin was not spread out evenly over the whole country. It con centrated upon two m ajor areas: 1. Transdanuhia, with prolongations northwards into the Vag valley and southwards into the Drava and Sava regions; a n d 2. Transylvania with extensions into the val leys of the right-bank tributaries of the Tisza. The two areas were separated from one another by sparsely populated, marshy zones. Thus, as far as the degree of civilization and geographic con ditions allowed it, the land was already filled to capacity in the Bronze Age (c. 1900 B.C.) by a permanent, mostly agricultural population. The areas that were still available for future migrants consisted of flooded and mountainous regions, excellent places for pastoral population that soon came wave after wave.

3. The identity o f the first settlers
The reader has no doubt noticed that most of the old place-names which were handed down by the first population of the Carpatho-Danubian area had some definite meaning in Hungarian. This fact suggests that they probably spoke Hungarian. This question shall now be analysed in more detail. The archaeological remains of the epoch allow us to distinguish the presence of three closely related but different ethnic groups. The largest one was made up of farmers, usually referred to as Magari (Magyars) or A n (Aryans). The second largest consisted of those engaged in anim al hus bandry, and were called Siculi, Sikeloi (Sz^kely), while the third and smallest group were pastoralist people, an occupation frequently connected with the Kush. The following explanations support the threefold division, based upon the respective eco nomic activity. 1. T h at the D anubian farmers were Aryans and first practised their trade all over Central Europe, was first noticed by L.A. Waddell, who stated th a t “the Aryans were the forerunners of the agricul tural stage in the world’s civilization” (P 132 p. 49). T h at these farmers were MagAri, or M a gyars, appears from the analysis of the Magyar name itself, whose etymological meaning is, strict



ly speaking, ‘farm er’. It was used, and still contin ues to be in th a t sense, both in Hungary and its neighbouring countries. In Hungarian, indeed, a ‘farm stead’ was M ajor (pron. Moyor), and in the Austro-Bavarian German dialect, the word for ‘peasant’ is similarly M ayer and Meyer. Farther west in Germany, however, the common word for the same term is ‘Bauer’. In addition to the semantic connection of ‘agri culturist’ with the M agyar name, there is much evidence suggesting th at the bulk of the Neolithic and Bronze Age inhabitants were really Magyars. Such evidence includes the ethnic symbols, with which they identified themselves in pictorial writ ing. The most widely used ones were: (1) the bird (M adar), because it sounded like Magyar; (2) the lion, which was M agaru (= Magyar) in SumerianHungarian; and (3) a bee (Meh), which combined with the wearer (Ur) formed the symbol Mehar, which also sounded Hke Magyar. The role of the first two symbols as Magyar ethnic identification badges was already discussed, therefore there is no need to return to this subject. For the use of the bee-symbol, however, we mention two in stances: first, th at the famous neolithic obsidian factory was operating in Hungary a t Meh-Telek, i.e. on a ‘Bee-Plot’ and secondly th a t Herodotus records th at in the Carpatho-Danubian region there are great m ultitudes of ‘bees’, so th a t it is impossible to visit th a t land (P 067 Book V cap. 10).



At this point we wish to introduce a unique siMluette as well, found in a site of the neolithic I’isza-culture (Fig. 23). It represents the harvest ilivinity, holding a sickle in his right hand, an implement whose form is the wellknown abbrevia(ion in the H ungarian carved script for Isten ‘God’. I’lie sta tu e tte in question belongs to the category ()l the so-called ‘talking statues’, because its poslure coveys a message (P 074 p. 21). We can read il by naming its conspicuous elements one after .mother: the clenched hand (MArok), the arms in the plural KAR.ok, the face AR, and the belt RA. These elements identify the God as being Isten, M A -K A R .ok Ura ‘God, Lord of the Maf^yars’. The ancient Egyptian kings, who were also considered earthly deputies for God, were fre quently represented in exactly the same posture, as for instance King Ramses II, whose image is shown above (Fig. 22). The strong Egypto-Hungarian relations, which are apparent even here, do not surprise us for all three major Magyar ethnic symbols originated there. In ancient Egypt, the bird was the param ount divine symbol, the lion usually accompanied the royal image, while the bee in the royal cartouche was used to render the king’s title as ruler of Lower Egypt. This suffices to conclude th at the bulk of the first sedentary population of Old Hungary consisted of Hungari an-speaking, agricultural Magyars. These early settlers transplanted Egyptian agricultural know



how, tradition and mentality into the Middle Danube basin.
2. H ungary’s next most numerous people of the Bronze Age, known by name, were the Siculi or Sikeloi inhabitants, whose descendants are called Szekely (pron. Sakaly). They form a solide block of two and a half million Magyar-tongued inhabi tants in the heart of Transylvania, the eastern province of historical Hungary. Their admirable folklore is their most characteristic ethnic feature and is fully perm eated with the old solar cult. The visible image of their pre-Christian divinity, the Sundisc, is usually displayed in their coat of arms, together with the waxing Moon and the eightpointed star. They are identical to those seen on ancient Mesopotamian documents. The Siculi be lieved their God was a hum an shaped giant, riding on a horse or in a brilliant chariot in the sky. All the words used by the Siculi in connection with the said idea-complex —Sun, Sky, Horse, Chariot, Way, Seat and so on —belong to the oldest layer of the Hungarian vocabulary. The etymological meaning of their name is also Hungarian, and corresponds to their intim ate religious life. Sikeloi is, indeed, a compound with the following ele ments: S-IKE-LO-I, which would be spelt today A z Egi L6-i, meaning ‘Follower of the Celestial Horse’ or, more plainly, ‘Believer in Sungod’. The Siculi or Sikeloi always played a significant p art in H ungary’s history. Prior to their alliance with Prince Arpad, they were allies of the Hun



Ilungarians, in the Kingdom of Attila, according (o our national Annals (P 120 I p. 101). They ^Iso look p art in the decisive battle which brought about the downfall of the Hun Empire. Three (housand Siculi cavalery-men managed sometiow to escape from the bloody battle and went into hiding in the unidentified Chigla-Field, waiting for the return of “other” Hungarians {usque (id aliorum Hungarorum reditum, P 120 I p. 279). As a m atter of fact, when they found out, a t the end of the IX th century, th at a new Magyar group was on the way to Hungary under the leadership of Prince Arpad, the Siculi horsemen, who had been living in the land for a long time, galloped to the Carpathian passes to great their brethren. Then, according to their agreement, they helped unify the land into a single dominion. From that moment on, the fate of the Siculi merged 'vith that of the Arpad Hungarians. During the reign of King Attila, the bulk of the Siculi-Hungarians still dwelt in the w estern borders of the Carpathian land; in Upper Hungary and in Transdanubia. They were the stock breeders of the epoch, belonging to a semi-military organization in charge of the defence of the ^vestern boundaries of the Hun Empire. They were directed by chiefs called Ld/b, literally ‘Great m en’, a title equivalent to the medieval marquis. After the Hun-era, when the desintegrated country was re-united by Prince Arpad and the Nation was converted to the Christian faith, the



eastern borders of the land became the most sensitive ones. Therefore, th e first Magyar kings transferred the SicuU frontier-guards from Upper Hungary into Transylvania for further duties. This displacement is evidenced by a series of medieval charters and more recently by a toponymic study showing th a t 36 village-names of T ran sylvania are the exact duplicate of as many Upper Hungarian place-names {Magyar Mult, Sidney, 1977 no. 2). The T ransdanubian Siculi, who were not involved in the massive transfer, remained in their original location in the West. Their long stay here explains the surprisingly high number of solar place-names, especially in Zala county, and also the existence of certain common dialectal particu larities between the Transylvanian and the Trans danubian populations of today. The fact th a t the Sicuh’s first places of habita tion were in the western parts of historical H un gary, suggests th at they may have entered into the land via the Adriatic Sea. The probability of this itinerary is dram atically confirmed by the presence of other Siculi on the western side of the Adriatic, namely on the Italian peninsula. This fact also suggests a simultaneous arrival into both lands in question, around the X lth century B.C. (cf. P 100 ‘Sicel’). T h a t the Italian Siculi formed the integral p art of the great Siculi migration is further evidenced by the fact th at they too were led by chiefs called Syc-Lo-Pe and Laes-TuriGones, as reported by Thukydides in a distorted



lorm (P 126 Book VI cap. 18). These term s would l)c, in the more correct spelling, Sikel L6-F6 (after (he P > F soundshift in Lo-Pe),meaning ‘Siculi (Ireat M en’; and Lovas Turi Hon6s ‘M ounted Trojan Ancestor’ re sp e c tiv e ly .A n o th e r signifi cant detail: one of the Siculi kings, Italus by name, l)ecame the namegiver of the whole Peninsula, and also of the present Italian nation.^^ The Siculi in Italy were not numerous enough to keep the whole peninsula for themselves. Actu ally, they were driven out therefrom around 1035 B.C., when the m ajority of them crossed over to the island of Sicily and forced the earlier inhabi tants to retreat into its western parts while they occupied all the rest of the land, changing its name to ‘Sicilia’, They lived in peace on the island about
41. In the light of the etymology given there, we have to abandon the fantastic explanation of the Greek writers of the past, who believed that the Italian Siculi were governed by One-Eyed Giants, interpreting the Syc-LoPe expression as being the Greek word Cyclops.
42. Thukydides relates that “the country owes its name of Italy to Italus, a king of Sicel, so called.” Now, Ital, as a Hungarian word, means a ‘drink’, and Italos some body ‘fond of alcoholic drink’. The explanation seems to be a fitting one, because the early Sicels are said to have been fond of wine, which they drank in the Scythian fashion, i.e. unmixed with water (P 067 Book VI cap. 84 and Book I cap. 106). — Incidentally, the Greek name of Sungod, Apollo, is, in their language, a Hungarian loan-word, made up with Pe -I- L6, and the prefixed definitive article A, whence A Pe-Lo, con tracted into Apollo, Hterally means ‘The Chief Horse’.



three hundred years, until the Hellens began to drive them out. In the V lth century B.C., the Sicilians were defeated in battle and their separate national identity was gradually dissolved, — ac cording to Thukydides. Outside of Hungary and Italy, numerous Siculi tribes were also to be found in the northwestern Punjab (India). They were locally known as Sakai or Sakae (P 044 ‘Sakai’), the same as the H ungari an Szekely. These Hindu-Sikeli were also followers of the Sungod, calling him Sacra ( < Az Eg Ura) ‘Lord of the Sky’. His female associate was Sacra N i (H.: Sacra Neje) ‘Wife of the Heavenly Lord’. All the Hindu Sikeli were engaged in animal hus bandry. To sum up, the Siculi were a widely diffused ancient race o f the Iln d and 1st millen^ iums B.C. One of their branches became, together with their Magyar brethren, the founders of Euro pean Hungary, as seen from an ethnic standpoint.
3. Traces of a third people are also discernable in the Neohthic and Bronze Ages in Hungary. They originated from the Kush or Cushan folk, usually referred to in the scientific language as M editerraneans or Dinarians without, however, sufficiently emphasizing their characteristic brownish complexion. The Kush race was first identified in Eastern Africa, around the Great Lakes. It was also a widely diffused old race, but broken up into a multitude of smaller or larger ethnic entities th at lacked any comprehensive political organisation for a long time. They were



the first great historical people to send out colo nists into southwest Asia and into Europe, includ ing Hungary. The European branch of the Kush seems to have spoken the Hungarian language: whether through origin or by assimilation, is not yet clear. At any rate, all their identifying symbols are Hungarian. The most widely used such symbol was the ram: it accompanied them through all their wanderings, in Egypt, Hungary, as well as in India and Touran. Ram in Hungarian is Kos (pron. Kush), which was also their national name. Their rulers, both terres trial and divine, were called Fd-Kos, ‘The Principal K ush’, and his distinctive symbol was a kind of spontoon, called Fokos in Hungarian, a word th a t sounds like their name. Kristof Lukacsy, a distin guished Hungarian historian of the X lX th centu ry, was positively convinced th at the language of the Kush was Hungarian, even while they were still sojourning in the Oxus region of Touran (P 092 p. 85). T he early presence of the Kush in Hungary is evidenced by a ram-headed altar found in a neo lithic layer near Szeged. And the last notable group of them lived in Upper Hungary, during the reign of King St. Stephen (1000-1038). Their dis trict was known as ‘Dark H ungary’ (Ungaria Nigra), as opposed to ‘W hite H ungary’ (Ungaria Alba), so called after the skin colour of the respec tive inhabitants. W ith the conversion to Christen dom, the cohesive force of the Kush was broken



and the people was absorbed into the majority. Their memory still lingers in such place-names as Kosd (< Kush-Ta), Kosna (< Kos Hona), Kustan ( < Kus Tanya) and the family name of Kos. To complete the presentation of the European Kush, we m ust also mention th a t classical and medieval historical sources inform us th at both Britain and France have a considerable number of Kush absorbed in their national body, who were locally called Picti (P 132 pp. 111-126 and P 065 p. 394). The Romans believed th a t they were so called, because their faces were “painted”, as the Latin word Pictus suggests. This view is, however, unacceptable because the Kush were already dark by birth and were called black well before the existence of the Latin language. The key to the solution lies in the Hungarian language, in which black is Fekete, whose old H ungarian form had been Pekete, Pekte, prior to the P > F soudshift. Consequently the oeiginal signification of the local name of the West European Kush simply m eant ‘dark’ and not ‘painted.’ Another local name of the dark people in the British Isles was Cassi, from whom the Scots originated. All the details listed above, when combined into a whole, are decisive proof th a t the earliest inhabi tants of the Carpatho-Danubian area were H un garians: variously known as agriculturist M a gyars, stock-breeding Siculi-Szekely, and darkish coloured pastoral Kush. In other words the present-day H ungarians seem to be direct de

4. The testim ony of the Tat&rlaki (Tartaria) tablets
1. The first inhabitants of the Carpatho-D anubian area have bequeathed us with decisive histor ical evidence of their ethnic and hnguistic identity, in three inscribed clay tablets found at T atarlaka (now T artaria), near the river Maros, in 1961 (Fig. 28). They turned up in a mound barely measuring 240 m X 100 m. One of the tablets is a roundel with a hole, while the two others are rectangular. The larger rectangular one also has a hole, but the smaller one only bears the picture of a horned goat. All three tablets appear to have been locally made, while the accompanying ob jects come from the M editerranean and were ei ther Cretan or Cycladic. The tablets aroused world-wide interest, because they gave scholars a concrete chance of identifying the language spoken by the earliest population of the Carpatho-Danubian basin.

Our inquiry about the tablets in question re quires an answer to the following three questions: (1) for which purpose were the tablets made? (2) w hat message is written upon them ? and (3) to which historical period do they belong? Amongst



the m ultitude of studies already devoted to clear ing up the mystery of these written documents found on the soil of ancient Hungary, the most valuable is th a t of Prof. M.S.F. Hood (USA) even though he failed to discover the purpose of the tablets and denied th at there was actual writing in the signs carved upon the pieces.^-^ Concerning the age of the tablets, there were two opinions. The first emphasizes the Mesopotamian character of the writing and, on th at basis, suggests th at the tablets may have been made in the Urukperiod, somewhere around 3000 B.C. The second opinion, th at of Prof. Hood, insists upon their Cretan parallels and upon their Aegean and Ana tolian connections in general. Accordingly, the holder of this second view assigns a considerably later period to the objects and suggests th at they may have been made between 2000 B.C. and 1700 B.C. Since then, no new judgements have been formulated so th a t the mystery of the T atarlaki tablets continues to remain unsolved, more than twenty years after their discovery. 2. In our procedure of trying to find the secret of the Tatdrlaki tablets, we m ust first ascertain
43. Prof. Hood is reluctant to see actual writing upon the tablets: “But do the Tartaria ( = Tatarlaki) tablets actually be£U‘ writing? Probably not... It seems quite possible that they were merely an uncomprehending imitation of more civilized peoples’ written records... a pretense by some illiterate barbarian to command the magic embodied in an art he had witnessed but did not understand” (P 068).






the purpose for which they were made. This inqui ry begins with the etymology o f Tatdrlaka, the name of the village where they were discovered. It is a H ungarian compound, whose last element (-Laka) means a detached, small cottage, Hterally ‘the dwelling of. B ut the first part of the name (Tatdr) cannot be interpreted as having been the dwelling of some T artarian person, because T ar tars never lived in Hungary, particularly not in pre-Christian times. The full name in question is actually made up with the following elements: Tat-Ar-Lak-a, the vocalized form of an original deeper sounding T6t-Ur-Lak-a, with the literal meaning of ‘God T h o t’s Cottage’. T h a t makes sense, because God T hot was an im portant Egyp tian divinity: patron of writing and reckoning, who was also in charge of measuring time and doing solar observations for the purpose of calendar making. In th at perspective it seems logical to conjecture, th at the Tatarlaki tablets themselves may have been used for solar observations and, ultimately, for setting up calendars.^^ This conclu sion is supported by other, circum stantial evi dence.
44. The calendar was a precious instrument in the hands of every farming community of the Antiquity. It enabled the peasants to know the most appropriate time to carry out certain important tasks, such as plowing and sowing in particular and it was also useful for the timing of religious festivals.



To begin with, the plot where the find was made is a small one, inadequate for farming. It was, however, large enough to make astronomical ob servations, especially during the summer. Then, the picture of a crab and a horned goat, engraved upon the tablets, is further evidence supporting this idea. The same animals, indeed, are part of the Zodiac, the crab being the symbol of the Cancer constellation, and the horned goat that of the Capricorn. Moreover, the circular hole ap pearing both on the roundel and upon the larger rectangle must have been connected with celestial observations, because this latter hole is surrounded by sunbeams to show, unequivocally, th at the rising Sun is m eant thereby. Finally, the most conspicuous details of the roundel supply us with the decisive word: Calendar. In fact, the circular hole represents the Sun, in Hungarian NAP, the giant cross intersecting the roundel carries the sound-value of T, and the circular rim of the object supplies the final constituent AR. These sounds, put together, give the word Nap-T-Ar, Naptdr, which is the H ungarian word for ‘Calendar’. It seems thus certain that the Tatdrlaki tablets were components of a sophisticated solar observatory, and were used for determining time:^-^
45. In atlantic Europe, the observation of the various sea sonal positions of the Sun, in reference to the zodiacal star-clusters, was made with the help of heavy megalithic structures (e.g. Stonehenge). In the Danubian region,



3. Before proceeding to our next task, i.e. deci phering the script engraved upon the tablets, we m ust take a glimpse into the astronomical thinking of Antiquity. At th at time, the Sun was considered a human-shaped divinity always on the move in the sky, following a fixed yearly path, during which it bypasses 12 im portant stations or groups of conspicuous stars called constellations. Several of these groups appear before the eyes of observers, as shaping celestial animals. Hence their names: Aries, Crab, Lion, Capricorn and so on. All to gether, these anim als form the ‘Animal belt’ or Zodiac. The Zodiacal constellations were closely watched by ancient astronomers, because they were suitable phenomena for meeisuring time. Cer tain ones heralded the beginning of the seasons on a fixed day: Spring (M arch 21), Summer (June 22), A utum n (September 23) and W inter (December 22). In the northern hemisphere, the constellation th at could be observed most easily, was the one which signaled the beginning of Sum mer. Daylight lasts longest on th at day, when the Sun ceases to ascend higher on the horizon, and begins its downward course. This change of direc tion takes 11 days, during which the Sun rises every morning at the same time and on the same point of the horizon, as if it had stopped moving.
the more advanced microlithic structure prevailed. This is the significant difference between the two halves of Europe, although this has never been pointed out until now.



So much suffices to understand the sense of the message upon the roundel, to which we now return. The sound-signs appearing on the round tablet ;ire, in our opinion, not Sumerian picture-signs, hut more advanced carved signs. Most of them correspond to Old H ungarian writing signs (see Kig. 14). The only m ajor difference the T atarlaki tablets display vs. the Old H ungarian letters lies in their outward appearance: the Tatdrlaki writing lias a marked preference for linking signs together into bizarre geometric shapes. The very close re semblance of the T atarlaki signs to the Old H un garian ones invites us to try to read the mysterious message in Hungarian, beginning with the roundel, according to our Fig. 29, whereon the signs are separated into words.
The first p art of the message is placed in the upper half of the object in question. It reads from left to right and the signs are transliterated as follows: eZ. iR-aNY-O(n) J.6N eS.T.eN. 4. 05
Fig. 29. The soim d-signs o f the Tat&rlaki tablets, sep arated into words.



0-Ra.K.oR. With present spelling; Ez irdnyon jon Isten 4.05 orakor, in literal translation; ‘God comes (= the Sun rises) in this direction a t 4;05 o’clock.’ The second p art of the message, inscribed on the lover half the roundel, reads in the reverse direction, from right to left, as is indicated by the so-called turning letters, specially N, R and K. It runs thus; E LE .R E aR.dK. S.iL.oK eg.oV6.Be(n) 5 + 5 + eGY (= 1 1 ) E.Ta.K -aN , in present spelling; Elore a rdk csillog egoveben 11 ejszakdn ‘Beforehand the Crab is twinkling in its celestial zone for 11 nights.’ Is our reading reliable? It is, when considering the following. First, the decipherment produced a coherent and closely reasoned message, in which all the written signs appear with their own soundvalue. This fact alone is usually considered as sufficient proof for the correct reading. Secondly, the message uses a highly technical language, according to the time and circumstances, which we can however understand, since we already know the fundamentals of ancient mentality. Be sides, it follows the golden rule of the well written ancient inscriptions, inasmuch as it uses seven words — not less, nor more — in both sentences. Finally, all statem ents refered to in the inscription are accurate, and all have been confirmed, since then, by modern science. In fact, on the first day o f Sum m er (June 22), the Sun rises at Tatdrlaka, on the 46th parallel, exactly at five minutes past four o’clock.



Our next problem is to decipher the message iiis< Iil)t*ci upon the larger rectangular tablet. It is 111\ idl'd into three com partm ents. We are, alas, 1111;11)Ie to make out the meaning of the signs placed 1111() (he first com partm ent; but the remaining p art IS ( li'ar enough and says: ‘Here the Sun rises in I Ilf Cancer (constellation) on the day of...’ (missing
Ki. The step-by-step explanation of the inscription is thus: in the second compartment we can distinguish the rising Sun, in Hungarian A Nap. On its right side, the contours of a mouse (H.: A z Eger) are visible, with its thin, long tail. The picture of this animal is here because it is homophonous with the expression A z £gre, ‘to the sky’. So, the thusfar deciphered words say this: A N ap az Egre ‘The Sun to the sky’. After that, we read the signs placed in the left and right columns, saying: the cross sign iT, the crab A RAK, followed by a sign for the sound-group KUR/KOR, and finally the word for don key IA. In modern Hungarian: Itt a rdkkor j6 ‘Comes at this spot in the Cancer constellation’. The directive continues in the third compartment thus: aN -aP Je-Le aR -aK oV-Be... ‘The day’s symbol in the Cancer zone is... The complete message in better English reads: ‘Here (at Tat&rlaka) the Sun appears on the horizon in the Cancer constellation on the day of... —The homophony existing between ‘Sky God’ (Az Egicr) and the mouse (Az Eger) was probably the origin of the never-explained Oriental custom of keeping white mice in Sun-temples, as was the case in Babylon and Egypt. The presence of these small animals was a mean amongst a hundred others, to remind the believers that God may hide himself in any of his creatures to watch over their behaviour.



The smaller rectangle has no carved script scratched upon its surface, nor a hole to let the sunbeams penetrate into the observatory room. On its surface is a horned goat with an elevenbranched tail, symbol of the Capricorn constella tion which announces the beginning of Winter. Behind the goat, the outlines of a roaring animal are discernible, probably th a t of the celestial dog, urging the Sun to ascend on its brilliant way again. T h at the goat’s picture holds for the Sun, is evidenced by its having five legs, five being the sacred number of the solar divinity. To make a hole on this tablet would have been useless, be cause in winter the sky is usually overcast in Tatarlaka, and no astronomical observations can be made. 4. The last question in connection with the Tatarlaki tablets deals with the setting of the approximate date when the tablets could have been in use for solar observations. Prof. Hood approached this question by comparing the tablets with similar archaeological remains found at Knossos in Crete and concluded th a t the T atarlaki tablets cannot be older than their Cretan variants, i.e. not older th an c. 1900 B.C. Therefore, he added, if the solar equipment in question has been found in a neolithic layer, th at could only have happened if the pit in which it was found had been dug from a higher archaeological level. Our own estimation, based upon the history of writing, supports the opinion of Prof. Hood all the more, because certain



(1;Il ing terms, such as “eleven tim es”, appear on I lu* similar Cretan tablets as well. Since, however, I h e writing on the Tat^irlaki tablets is more matu r e , a younger age would be more suitable for tliem . This age can be determined through a mathematical operation, by converting the si dereal time given in the inscription, into our present time-computing system, taking into con sideration the phenomenon of precession. This term designates the specific rotation of the E a rth ’s axis which causes the beginning of the various seasons not to always occur in the same group of stars (constellation), nor on the same day. The vernal point actually advances upon the ecliptic at a rate of one day in every 72 years. Therefore, after a shift of 30 days, i.e. 2160 years (= 30 X 72), the sunrise will already occur in another constellation. The Tatarlaki tablets report that the Sun’s descending course happened on the eleventh day of the Cancer constellation. On the other hand we also know th a t the Cancer constel lation lasted from c. 2220 B.C. to c. 60 B.C. (P 118 p. 78). Thus, its approximative age results from the m athem atical operation: B.C. 2220 minus II X 72, th a t is 1428 B.C. As it disclosed, the T atdrlaki inscriptions consti tute decisive historical evidence, whereby it be comes clear that the first perm anent population of the Carpatho-Danubian basin spoke Hungari an and that their leaders had highly sophisticated knowledge. That Hungarians were in evidence in



Central Europe considerably earlier than was heretofore believed, is a fact which obliges us to substantially modify our historical conceptions about the peoples of Europe in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages.

THE SCYTHIAN HUNGARIANS
1. Their origin and civilization
The history of the Scythians is so complicated and forms such a tangled skein of varied problems —says A. L. Mongait —th at, in spite of abundant sources for its study, “the Scythian problem re mains an intransigent subject, th a t is still far from settled” (P 097 bis p. 153). At one time the Scyth ians are said to be Indo-Europeans, on the basis of the similitude of their language; at another, they are considered Huns, with whom they shared their cultural features. Elsewhere, it is maintained th at they belonged to the Hungarian-speaking group of peoples (Uralo-Altaians), with whom they were closely linked throughout their history, both in the Orient and the Occident. All these opinions circulate freely, since nobody has, as yet, correctly analysed the Scythian tongue, nor deciphered any of their w ritten messages. W hat is definitely known about the Scythians, however, is th at they did not all live in a single political structure, bul were broken up into several political entities, with as many individual ethnic denominations. I'iie lack of political unity of the Scythians could not, however, conceal their close affinities: they all spoke the same language, had the same solar cult, the sam e civilization and “were linked by some sort o f racial tie” (P 123 p. 42).



Their original homeland, or more precisely, the geographic area where history first detected them, was the northern hinterland of Mesopotamia and Syria. From these regions they were gradually squeezed out by the continuous razzias of the Assyrians, a Semitic population swarming out from the nearby deserts. They subjected the whole Scythian Old Fatherland to their iron rule during the V lllth century B.C. The destruction of the Kingdom of Arpad, on the great bend of the Euphrates, in 743 B.C. and the capture of the C ity-State of Karkemish in 717 B.C. were the final stage of Semitic expansion to the North. The Sythian tribes, driven out of their old homes, first concentrated along the Araxes and Kura rivers, in the swampy region of thousands of islands. Thereafter they gradually occupied the higherlying Terek and Kuban regions, and finally took possession of the large tract of land above the Caucasus, up to the elbow of the Volga. When they were at the zenith of their history, in the first millenium B.C., Scythian kings ruled over the immense natural grassland stretching from the Carpathians and the Lower Danube eastward, above the Black sea, to the Caucasian mountains (European Scythia) and the Caspian sea, including the Touranian Plain and the Oxus valley (Asiatic Scythia). In addition, detachm ents of Scythians occupied other farflung regions, such as northwest India and the eastern Asian section of the steppe, extending up to the Chinese borders.



lluling over such an extensive territory was only possible thanks to the large scale use of the riding horse, which allowed rapid communication be tween widely separated areas. This innovation explains why the Scythians became the first politi cal organizers in the history of the entire Eurasian steppe. Prior to the use of riding horses, greater political units could be established in large river valleys only, where boats fulfilled the same role, as in the Nile valley and also in the Euphrates and Indus valleys. It was between 750 B.C. and 500 B.C. th a t the individuality of the Scythians emerged. They had then a mixed economy; some agriculture, large scale stock-raising, (in which horse-breeding was predominant) and also mining and metal working. They lived under kings and princes whose principal identifying emblem was the golden stag medal. They always moved around on horseback and wore close-fitting pantalons. Their most important arm was a longrange bow, having arrows fitted with triangular metal heads. Under the impact of the new equestrial armies, the Scythians evolved a peculiar defense system, consisting of earthworks. Its purpose was to render any sudden mounted attack against hum an settlem ents impossible. The system included a fortified ram part or dike with a deep and wide ditch, filled with water on its outside. The ram part was then planted with thorny hedges, shrubs and trees. These fences extended for hundreds of miles and surrounded



thousands of acres of soil as well, to keep the livestock protected against predators. This Scyth ian military strategy set the pattern for the entire steppe-population and was to remain unchanged for centuries to come.
2. Scythians in Hungary
Owing to the growing pressure of the Sarmatians, another m ounted steppe people, the Euro pean Scythians slowly drifted westward. They percolated through the Carpathians, and gradual ly brought the G reat Hungarian Lowland, the westermost fringe of the great Eurasian natural grassland, under their control. They soon transported hereto their royal seat and thus H un gary became the center of Scythian rule. The first Scythian group reached H ungary around 550 B.C. They were called Agathyrsi and have established campsites in the Upper Maros region. They were followed by other groups, occupying many places on the Great Plain, the Transylvanian plateau and in the Bukk and M atra area. The Scythians were the first Danubian people to establish effective rule over the entire population of Hungary. Thus, the Carpatho-Danubian basin was first unified politi cally by them. During their rule in Hungary (c. 500 B.C. — 350 B.C.), the Scythians came into contact with the aboriginal Magyar population on



;i large scale, through intermarriage. Following I h is historical process, all the M agyar speaking PDimlation of the Danube basin began to call t/icmselves “Scythians”, an appellation th a t strongly influenced the view of the medieval I hroniclers, who considered the Magyars as a Gens Scythica. The long stay in Hungary of the Scythi;in ruling clan is evidenced by the most beautiful Scythian treasure ever found, consisting of two uold stags, discovered at Tapio-Szent-M arton and at Zold-Halom-Puszta respectively (Fig. 30-31). The last major detachment of Scythians entered (he land under the general name of Sarm ati (Sar

matians). They are, however, most frequently mentioned by their clan-names, as Alani, Yazigues and Roxolani. The Yazigues settled in Hungary in A.D. 20, and occupied the pasture-land between the Danube and the Tisza rivers, where they erected strong fortifications. Thanks to their inac cessible territory, they could preserve their auton omous rule during the Roman occupation of Pannonia and Dacia. They lost their ethnic identity during the Hun period, but a large district and a county still retain their name. The presence of Scythians in Hungary is super bly documented by the archaeological remains of their civilization; grave-mounds and colossal de fence installations. The grave-mounds or barrows resulted from the earth they heaped up upon the tombs of their defunct leaders, kings or princes. Grave-mound in H ungarian is Sir-H alom or sim ply Halom. This term forms part of several dozens of old place-names all over the country, such as Herceg-Halom, ‘Prince’s M ound’; Zdld-HalomPuszta ‘Green Mound on the Steppe’ (there are four such names), in one of them a precious gold stag-medal was found, proving th a t the mound is really a princely one; Sas-H alom ‘Eagle’s M ound’; Hegyes-Halom ‘Pointed M ound’ (two such names); Szdz-H alom ‘Hundred M ounds’ (where the victims of a huge battle have been buried in the Hunnic times). Until 1939, 85 Scythian burial sites were excavated in Hungary, a testimony of the numerous Scythians who were living there.



The innumerable remains of the former Scyth ian defense system allowed the archaeologists to reconstruct its whole extension. The main line, often in triple rows, started at the Danube elbow at Vdc and proceeded eastwards along the n orth ern edge of the Great Plain through Eger and 'Pokaj to Nyiregyh^za. At th at point it turned southwards, by-passed Szatmdr, Nagyvarad, Gyula and Versec, and a t th a t level, it reached the Danube again. At certain strategically impor tan t points, such as at Sopron on the west, and the region of Di6sgyor in the northeast, more elaborate embankments were constructed. Sec ondary or disconnected ditches existed near rivers at crossings and fords (Garam, Vag, Maros, Temes, Olt), and in m ountain passes as well. The rectan gular rich land between the Danube and the Tisza to the south was protected by triple lines on its open northern side. The total length of the em bankments and ditches in Hungary exceeded 1700 km, while the enclosed and protected area measured 62,000 km-. The building of these de fence lines required the removal of 20,000,000 m ‘ of earth (P 084 and P 102). The technical terms for the various parts of the defence installations were the following: the general name of earthen stronghold was Fdld-Vdr; the ditch was Arok; the ram part or embankment was Gat; the fence or hedge on top of the embankment Sdveny; the enclosure or area surrounded with entranchment was Sane or Udvar. These technical terms occur



dozens in Old Hungarian place-names; one ^nly to open the Directory of H ungary’s ^ ^'nam es to be convinced about this. We have I names as Duna-FoWudr, Arok Szallas, GdtSOveny-HAza., Sane, Sdnci-Puszta, SdncUdvar-Hely, etc.

3. The language of the European Scythians
Ancient authors, such as Herodotus, Strabo, Plinius, Jordanes and others agree th at all Scyth ian people spoke the same language, and modern scythologists have also accepted this view almost unanimously. The controversy begins with the next question, viz. w hat was this language and with which language group was it affiliated? In trying to solve this mystery, we will examine, in turn, common Scythian words recorded by foreign authors, then Scythian ethnic and personal names, and finally Scythian symbols and other written evidence. One of our principal sources is, of course, Hero dotus who had such a keen interest in the Scythian way of life th a t he undertook the tiresome journey to Olbia on the Black Sea shore to find out more about it. He noted th at every Scythian carried an inward curving sharp knife strapped to his boot, and called “A Cina Kesh”. In present graphic form, this expression would be A csizma kes (The Boot Knife), whose most im portant element Kesh, ‘Knife’is Kes in Hungarian as well. Herodotus also relates that one of the Scythian names for Sungod was Oetos-Ur-Us, which is also a Hungarian name



Otos Ur-Os ‘Num ber 5 D ivinity’, five being the sacred number of the Sungod, as already men tioned. The M aster also noticed th at Upper Scythia is often snow-covered in winter, for which reason the soil is concealed from view for months. And he adds th at the Scythians call the snow flakes ‘feathers’. Similarly, in H ungarian the same word FHhe is used for both the fine feathers and the light snow-flakes. The father of historiography was charmed with all th at he had learned about the principal Scyth ian river, the Dnieper, then called Danaber, some thing like Tanya B or ‘River of the Field’ in H un garian. It was also called B or Ysthenes, which is again a H ungarian name, meaning ‘Divine W ater’ or ‘Fine W ater’. Then Herodotus lists a series of argum ents why the river is so fine. This river “has upon its banks the loveliest and most excellent pastures for cattles; it abounds in the most deHcious fish; its w ater is most pleasant to the taste; its stream is limpid.” All these added expressions bolster the Hungarian etymology of the word Ysthenes. And the other part of the river’s name, ‘Bor’, signifies in the local Sekeli-Hungarian dia lect of Transylvania, ‘drinking w ater’, m ost often of therm al origin.
Turning now to the Scythian ethnic and person al names, we again refer to Herodotus who says th at the name by which the Scythians above the Black Sea called themselves, was Scoloti, whereas the Assyrians called them Ishkusai or Ashguzai



and the Greeks simply Skytoi. When these names are placed back into their original spelling, accord ing to the phonetical evolution of the Hungarian, they prove to have been taken from the Hungarian vocabulary. All the names in question term inate with the adjectival suffix -i, which gives the name the meaning of ‘originating from’, ‘coming from’ or ‘native o f. It follows th a t the preceding word m ust indicate the specific geographic area where the Scythians formerly lived. In the case of Scoloti ( < H.: Os-Kelet-i) this original homeland is ‘An cient Orient’ (the same as Chaldi, Khaldi), by which name Babylon was also called. The meaning of Ish-Kuza-i and Ash-Guza-i presents no diffi culty, when remembering the easy interchangeabi lity of the kindred consonants K, G and H. It means in H ungarian Os-haza-i ‘Originating from the Old Fatherland’, —again Mesopotamia, the same geographic area. At first sight, less evident is the etymology of Skytoi, which may be the Grecized form of the original Hungarian Szigeti ‘Coming from the Isles’, a reference to their so journ in the thousand islands of the rivers Kur and Araxes in the southern Caucasus. All the names analyzed were first given to the Scythians while they were still living in the Cau casian region, busy reconstructing their political set-up with various ‘blood-contracts’. They re tained these names even later, when another of their group settled in a similar region, around the other side of the Caspian Sea (in Touran). Because



of the m ultitude of isles in th a t area as well, Ptolem y called it Insulae nationum , ‘Isles of N a tions’. From the third century B.C. onward, when the Scythians had already lived for generations in their acquired ‘Scythia’, they were no longer considered as newcomers, bu t as ‘natives’ in their own country. Accordingly, they began to be called Hon-i, or in ancient Hungarian spelling: Huni ‘Natives’, ‘C ountry-M en’, again in plain Hungari an. The first Scythian detachments posted on Hungarian soil were the Agathyrsi, in the Upper Maros valley, Transylvania. They were assigned to frontier-guard duties, as their name clearly implies: A Gath Yrsi < A Gat Orzo ‘Guardians of Em bankm ents’. The last Scythian confeder ation of tribes to settle in Hungary were the Yazigues: they settled between the Danube and the Tisza rivers, in the southern central part of Hungary in A.D. 20. By trade, they were cattle keepers and shepherds, as is proven by their name: Yazigue < Jo szdg (or) being ‘C attle (keepers). The list of Scythian ethnic denominations can be completed by a few royal names with a clear meaning. These are mainly the ones which include the distinguishing word ‘A ryan’, Ur, Ar in H ungar ian, as Aria-Peita < A rja Fajta ‘King who is of Aryan origin’; A ri-A ntus < A rja Honos ‘Aryan Land Ancestor’; Scyl-Urus < UrOs ‘Szekely Ances to r’. All the foregoing details are sufficient to convince the reader th at the Scythians were m is judged until now as fa r as their ethnic and lin



f’uistic identity is concerned. I t seems absolutely certain to-day that they were M agyar tongued and belonged to the once widely diffused Hungarian race.
The written documents the Scythians left be hind them bring fresh and decisive evidence to the above conclusion. Amongst such documents, the oldest one is w ritten by the pictorial m ethod which conveys abstract ideas by images of similar-sound ing concrete objects, as has been indicated several times. In Scythian practice, and also elsewhere, the pictorial writing was mainly used to express royal titles, such as Ancestor, Divine Ancestor. For the former title, the image of an eagle was used, whereas for the latter, th at of a stag. The names of these animals in Hungarian, Sas and Szarvas, sounded, indeed, like A z Os and A z Ur6s respec tively. This method of identifying rulers by that way was very widespread, especially in the first millenium B.C., so th a t a golden stag found in a Scythian mound was considered by archae ologists as the supreme evidence of being connect ed with a royal tomb. Because of inherent difficulties, pictorial writing was rarely used for communication of messages of any length; we know of only two such examples, both recorded by Herodotus. The first message narrates how the newly acquired Scythian King dom was inherited by Colaxis, the youngest of the three sons of Targitaus, the conqueror (P 067 Book V n cap. 64). God had strewn upon the earth, from



the sky, four golden implements: a plough, a yoke, a battle axe (sagaris) and a drinking cup. The Kingdom should be inherited by the one of the three brothers who could pick them up. The two elder brothers failed to do so because the gold took fire as they approached it. But when the youngest born neared the treasure, the flames suddenly vanished, and he picked up the gold. W hat was the divine message written with these golden objects? We can find out by writing down, one after another, the names of the four items in the Hungarian language: EKE.IGA. SAGARIS.KUPA, which gives the following simi lar sounding sentence: E/K EIG /A S/A G A R IS/ K EPE: E kOlydk az Egurds kepe ‘This child is the deputy for the Heavenly Lord’. T h a t meant, in contemporary language, the Colaxis (the Child) m ust assume the title ‘God on E a rth ’, i.e. the royal dignity. The children had understood the message and they agreed to bequeath the kingdom to the youngest born —says Herodotus. The second known pictorial message of the Scythians, also in the Hungarian language, was sent to King Darius in 512 B.C., when the latter invaded Scythia to avenge the destruction of As syria, a hundred years earlier. As the Persian armies bogged down, following the scorched earth pohcy of the Scythians, Darius, to save face, declared th at he would be satisfied with a symbolic submission by receiving the usual water and earth gift from the Scythian king. But, instead of the



required gift, the Scythian king sent Darius a bird, a mouse, a frog and five arrows. The Persian king thereupon consulted his chief advisors to find out the meaning of the message. There was, indeed, no doubt th a t this was a written document. The advisors were divided in their interpretation: some deciphered it as a peace-offer, the Scythian king would be willing to make to the Persians. Others thought th at the message contains a serious threat, viz. th a t all the Persians will be killed with arrows. Darius agreed with the second reading and, panic stricken, left Scythia on one of the following nights. To find out the meaning of the strange message, we again write down the corresponding Hungarian words: MADAR. EGER.BEKA. OT. NYIL and we find the similar sounding, sentence: M agyari ker beket ondla, ‘M agyar asks for peace with him ’, exactly as the first group of advisors had deciphered the message. A second interpretation is possible, when the word for mouse (eger) is replaced by another one for the same animal, Sir, used by the kindred Komi (P 060 p. 19). In th a t case the message reads thus: M agyar sirba ku ld nyillal ‘M agyar will kill thee with arrows’. And th a t was the way Darius himself interpreted the intention of the Scythians. Besides the pictorial writing, the Scythians were also acquainted with the carved script and be queathed us a unique message written in th at way. It is engraved upon a silver dish 14 inches wide found near the town of Sakiz to the south of Lake



Urmia. It is decorated with anim al figures in a row between two concentric circles. Its featured decor was a golden horse, set in the centre. The treasure was m eant for a wedding present offered by a Scythian prince on the occasion of the m ar riage of King B artatua or King Madyes, to an Assyrian princess in the second half of the V llth century B.C. (P 054 p. 106; P 123 p. 22 f.). The script (reproduced in P 054 p. 109 and explained in P 007 II p. 63 f.) reads thus in Hungarian: E kis tdlcdt valaki bUkeziien neki adja; as eke 16 ‘This small tray is generously given to him by somebody; its adornm ent is a horse’. After th a t follows the value of the ware, in conformity to ancient uses and customs. Now, the expression ‘its adorm ent is a horse’ conceals the identity of the donor as SekeU, ‘a Siculi’. Finally, we m ust mention th a t the Scythians probably had studied and used Greek letters as well, proof of which are two coins of the Indian Saka-dynasty (first century B.C.). On one of the coins the following Magyar words appear: TURANNO UNTOS ‘ERAOY and on the other side: SAKA KOGGANOI. On the second coin: YRKODOY MAKAROV, and on the back: SK ’W R (i.e. SAKA UR), (transliteration in P 059 p. 133). According to the present H ungarian ortho graphy, the inscriptions would read thus: 1. Turdni Honds, Kirdly — Szekely kagdn ‘Touranian land -ancestor, — Siculi kaghan’ and 2. Uralkodoja



M agyar — Szekely ur' ‘Its ruler is a Magyar, a Siculi Prince’.
The three kinds o f writing illustrated —pictori al, carved and alphabetical — definitely prove our previous statement: that the Scythians were a Hungarian-speaking people, literate and skillful in writing.
4. Who were the Kelti or Celts?
History books tell us, th a t around 300 B.C. the name ‘Scythian’ abruptly vanished from circula tion, and th at per contra, the Kelti name made its appearance at about the same time. Is there any connection between the two phenomena? No body knows with any certainty, in spite of ample available material for the study of Celtic problems. In Hungary alone, for example, over 590 Celtic sites were discovered until 1976, — says Mikl6s Szab6, author of a book on the Celts in Hungary (P 119 pp. 36 and 16). The basic two volume publication of Henri H ubert (P 070) gives a great deal of factual information about the general history of the Celts, bu t is already somewhat antiquated. Two smaller recent works, the com prehensive study of Venceslav K ruta (P 083) and Jan Filip (P 049) respectively are far from able (o fill the gap. None of the authors mentioned look full advantage of the invaluable help topo



nymy offers to scrutinize the Celtic place-, ethnic and personal names, although such names are copiously recorded even in J. Caesar’s De bello Gallico. Furthermore, Celtic inscriptions engraved upon coins and other archaeological finds were also not taken into due consideration. We even ignore the meaning of the very name: Kelti. As regards the ethnic identity o f the Celts, it was thought, two generations ago, th at they were an individual, original hum an species, i.e. men of high stature and fair complexion. To-day our scholars are inclined to see in these ‘first Europe ans’ rather small-statured, lightly brownish complexioned ‘M editerraneans’. Again others are of the opinion th at the Celti were only a ruling class over the previously immigrated, predominantly pre-Indo-European population. Still others think th at the Celts were Indo-Europeans who strongly mixed with the aborigines. We do not lack hypoth eses, but the tru th is, as V. K ruta puts it: "For the time being, there exists no indisputable evi dence for the ethnic appurtenance of those who have been called the ‘Princes of the first Iron A g e” (P 083 p. 64). In the present state of our researches, we m ust make use of circumstantial evidences to learn more about the ethnic identity of the Celts. A closer look a t the manifestations of Celtic civilization, convinces us th at they contained no new feature; all their most striking characteristics having al ready been evident in the previous, Scythian civili



/at ion. These included the fortified place protected l)v embankments, ditches and hedges, the multiI iid e of animal images which pervaded their arts, I lie use of horses and sunworship, a heritage from t h e New Stone Age. There was only one new addition to Celtic culture: the extensive use of iron. It follows th a t the ‘Celts’ m ust have been an amalgam of the previous non-Indo-European in habitants of Europe. This is exactly w hat scholars have discovered during the course of their compar ative studies. It was found, indeed, th at the Picti of northern Scotland were already Celts —“early Celts” — who called themselves by th at word in the form of Khaldes or Chaltis, which is the Kelti in ancient graphic form (P 132 p. 139). J. Hawkes also places the makers of the bell-shaped vessels into the category of the Celts. There too, the peoples o f the barrow-graves can be found (i.e. the Scythians, P 049 pp. 16 and 20), and also the Turoni, who migrated from Central Europe to the banks of the Loire (P 089 p. 11), as well as the Secani, who went from Hungary to France, etc. There were also peoples called Kelto-Scythians, Kelto-Ligurians, Kelt-Iberi. Thus, it is evident, th at the Celts were not a new race in Europe, and the Celt or Kelti name was used as a comprehensive designation of the entire preChristian population o f Europe.^"^

The huge and kindred Celtic mass of B.C. Europe was linked together by a common language as well, in addition to the above-mentioned identi cal elements of their civihzation. According to the estimate of Camille Julien (Paris) “a hundred million” Europeans spoke the Kelti language in the second half of the first millenium B.C. Conse quently, there was no linguistic barrier in ancient Europe.4^ In spite of these categorical statem ents, nobody has, alas, identified the Celtic language, nor proved its affiliation with any other. In th at respect we are still completely in the dark. The reason? Nobody has yet approached the Celtic problem with the Hungarian key. In the following, we shall try to analyze the etymological meaning of the fundamental word: Kelti. Before us, Henri Hubert, the most eminent French specialist of the Celts has made great efforts to find out the meaning of the Celti name. He carefully noted all the various graphic forms in which this name occurred and concluded (1) th at it reached its widest diffusion during the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., and (2) th a t it contains
maia ont toujours 6t6 un groupe de peuples, formant un agr^gat de types du point de vue anthropologique» (P 057 p. 10; and see P 070 I p. X and P 132 p. 128). 48. The thesis of the linguistic unity of Celtic Europe is stressed by almost every author, as for example P 037 p. 12; P 057 pp. 10-12; P 070 I pp. 49, 51. The hundred million Celts £U-e mentioned in the publication P 057 p. 11.



(he rootword Kel (Quel in French graphic form), "implying the idea to rise” (P 070 I p. 27). He mentions this meaning as the most probable one, amongst many other conjectures listed in a foot note. He could, however, not go any farther in his explanations, thus the question remained unsolved.^^ In Hungarian the word K el signifies ‘to rise’ and Kelet the cardinal point where the Sun rises, i.e. ‘Orient, E ast’. And the same word, when the -i suffix is added as Kelt-i, Kelet-i m eans ‘He who has come from the direction of the rising S un’, i.e. from the Orient. In ancient times, this word was spelt in various ways, such as Chaldi, Chal dean and Scoloti. Like most ancient Hungarian ethnic names, it indicates no ethnic particularity, but is merely a geographic appellation recalling their previous fatherland. As such, it was a fitting comprehensive name, because all the pre-IndoEuropean ethnic groups originated from the same region: from the ancient Orient. Thus, the name Kelti or Keleti was the general term designating all the Hungarian speaking ethnic groups which had migrated to Central and Western Europe from the ancient Orient since the New Stone Age.
49. Henri Hubert consoles himself by saying: «Rien d’^tonnant que ces noms soient difficile i expliquer et que leur sens etymologique se soit 6vanoui» (P 070 I p. 27 f.).



The Kelti were a very cultured hum an mass, to whom Europe owes a great deal. They were the one who christened all the great rivers and mountains of that continent, who designated the places of the future great cities, and planned the first network of communication. They were the ‘first Europeans’. Had History given them another hundred years, they would have formed a great unitary nation, centered around Gallia and H un gary. B ut this century had not been granted to them. As is known, the Romans, “who have be come the enemy of the race which founded it”, literally destroyed this nation during its gestation. The holocust of the Celts in Gallia was perpetrated by Julius Caesar and his legions, in the first century B.C., between 59 and 51. They system at ically massacred all the political leaders of th at nation, their soldiers and priests, killing altogether three millions and setting fire to eight hundred towns and villages. After that, the people were economically ruined, terrorized, assimilated and Romanized. The history of Europe does not know of any other similar killings. Yet, Caesar had been whitewashed by historians of all his crimes and stands before us as a “Great European". Only the Kelti in Hungary were capable to outlive the century of hell in Europe.



THE HUN-HUNGARIANS
1. The Roman and Germanic influence upon the ethnographic conditions in the Carpatho-Danubian basin
1. The peaceful penetration of Magyar-speaking Oriental tribes into the Carpatho-Danubian region was interrupted after the Scythian and Celtic periods and was replaced by armed interventions from the West. First came the Romans, an imperi alist people. After having created a solid basis on the Apennine peninsula, they gradually extended their domination over the entire Mediterranean area during the second and first centuries B.C. Thereafter, for growing security and economic reasons, they extended the frontiers of their Em pire up to the Danube, which meant, for Hungary, the occupation of her western province, Transdanubia. After a difficult and long war (from 12 B.C. to 9 A.D.) they besieged it and about fifty years later converted the conquered land into a Roman province, under the name of Pannonia. They ruled this province for about four hundred years, and then gradually handed it over to the Huns, be tween 409 and 433.

THE HUN-HUNGARIANS
1. The Roman and Germanic influence upon the ethnographic conditions in the Carpatho-Danubian basin
1. The peaceful penetration of Magyar-speaking Oriental tribes into the Carpatho-Danubian region was interrupted after the Scythian and Celtic periods and was replaced by armed interventions from the West. First came the Romans, an imperi alist people. After having created a solid basis on the Apennine peninsula, they gradually extended their domination over the entire Mediterranean area during the second and first centuries B.C. Thereafter, for growing security and economic reasons, they extended the frontiers of their Em pire up to the Danube, which meant, for Hungary, the occupation of her western province, Transdanubia. After a difficult and long war (from 12 B.C. to 9 A.D.) they besieged it and about fifty years later converted the conquered land into a Roman province, under the name of Pannonia. They ruled this province for about four hundred years, and then gradually handed it over to the Huns, be tween 409 and 433.



W hat interests us, regarding the Roman rule of Pannonia, is to ascertain w hat h a d happened to the large M agyar-speaking population there. In th a t respect, we m ust first recall th a t the Roman conquest was prompted by strategic con siderations and its military character was predo m inant up to the very end. Above all, the Romans wanted to build a strong military barrier along the Danube. Secondly, the province’s Rom an gov ernors were not as blood-thirsty and ruthless as was Julius Caesar in Gaul. Thanks to these cir cumstances, the Roman conquest was neither fol lowed by wholesale massacres of the inhabitants, nor by the extermination of the upper classes, nor by the colonization of the land by a Latin-speaking population. The former tribal structure of the society was maintained, including local adminis tration (P 087 pp. 112, 117). The legions which were keeping watch on the Danube, and the various auxiliary personnel employed for guarding the military roads were mostly manned by a local population, including their commanders. More over, what was no less im portant: the Romans did not suppress the native beliefs. Thus, once the war was over, life, on the whole, followed its ancestral course. Taking all th at into account, our scholars evaluated the effect of Roman rule in Pannonia, from an ethnographic point of view, as harmless.
Those who studied Hungarian life in Pannonia under Roman rule more closely, have pointed out



certain linguistic facts which evidence the survival of the Hungarian language. The very name of the land Pannonia, for example, is a Hungarian com pound with Pan and Hon (= H .: Fenn-Hon) meaning ‘Upper L and’. The most im portant city was Savaria, so named after the Sungod (of. Savitra, Savarna, P 044). In th a t city, God was wor shipped in a great temple, which had an immense Sundisc above its altar. The present-day village of Szabar, near ancient Savaria, probably retains the ancient city’s names. For the survival of the Hungarian language under the Rom an rule, it is highly significant th a t the Roman emperors, coming from Pannonia, used Hungarian throne-names, as did H ad-Ri-Anus (117-138), A ur-E li-Anus (270-275), Val-Eri-Anus (253-260), and Sev-Erus (193-211). In these names the Hungarian component -Anus (= Honos) often appears, meaning ‘Country Ancestor’, or the word -Erus (Uros) ‘Divine Ancestor’. It is not surprising to find so m any H ungarian traces in Pannonia, since the political and military centre of the Roman Empire was, in the third and fourth cen turies A.D., no longer in Rome, but in Pannonia and Illyria instead. During this time, these prov inces, or rather their inhabitants, supplied the best soldiers, governors, and emperors, and also ‘R om an’ virtue. After the conquest of Pannonia, the Romans conquered the eastern part of Hungary as well



and emperor Trajan converted it to another Roman province named Dacia. The emperor per sonally conducted the military operations (101105). The occupation of this land was actually prompted by economic reasons: the Romans wanted to lay their hands upon the abundant supply of gold, silver, copper and salt which was mined there. Dacia’s occupation was, however, short lived, lasting about a century and a half. Indeed, the province had to be abandoned in 271, when Roman personnel was evacuated and with drawn to the southern shore of the Danube. The three most im portant Dacian cities, SarMizegeth-Usa, Napo-Ca, and A-Pu-Lum have clear Hungarian meanings. The first name would be in present spelling Sdr-M ezdket-Aso (city) ‘Where gold fields are dug’, the second N ap-Kd ‘Sun C ity’, and the third A Fd L6 (varosa) ‘(City) of the Principal Horse’, also a Sun city. The Roman never subjected the mountainous northern section of Hungary, nor the great Central Plain, between Pannonia and Dacia, to their rule. The tribes living in th at part of the land m ain tained their independence. So, Roman domination passed w ithout vital harm in Dacia as well. But, by dismembering the Carpatho-Danubian land into three parts, they retarded the unification of the diverse social groups into a single nation, a process which had been going on since Scythian times. Thus it happened that the territorial re-unification of the entire Carpathia area and the



building of a nation befall the next generation of great leaders: King Attila and Prince Arpad.
2. Shortly after the Roman Em pire’s entry into the Carpathian basin, Germanic tribes also began their penetration into the land. They started from their northwestern homeland Scandia (Scandina via) pushing eastwards on the East-European table-land until they had reached the River Don in the third century A.D. They were called Goths, and formed two separate groups, the Ostro-Goths and the Visi-Goths. A third Germanic tribal feder ation, the Gepids, was formed inside the C arpath ians, in Transylvania, above the Maros river, as far as the Tisza. The appearance of Germanic tribes in Eastern and Central Europe filled the Rom ans with fear, so they encouraged the Huns, who were also threatened, into action. The tense situation pro voked the armed intervention of the Huns in 375. After this, Germanic rule crumbled away and the Huns gained control over all eastern and central Europe. This is all well known in history, so th a t we do not need to discuss it. B ut less known is the ethnic build-up of the Germanic tribes in question. It is, indeed, a false assumption th a t the Germanic tribes were as fully Germanic in Eastern and Central Europe as they were when invading continental Europe from Scandinavia around Christ’s birth. The explanation is obvious: when the Germanic tribes started for the distant adven ture, they usually travelled w ithout women folk



and therefore strongly mixed with local population during their wanderings. T h at had the effect, th at within three or four generations, they were a completely different people from the one th at set out. The following short analysis will show how the Germanic tribes mixed with Hungarians when they reached the domain of the Magyar ethnic body. The name Gepida was given to the confeder ation of Germanic tribes which occupied northeas tern Hungary. It has no accepted etymology in the Germanic language, but has in Hungarian, where Gyep-i Ta means ‘(Men) of the Grass-Land’, where the Gepids actually lived. And in the case of the Visi-Goths, which name is supposed to signify ‘West G oths’ in the Germanic language, the H ungarian gives again a more plausible expla nation. In it Visi (in to-day’s H ungarian Vizi) means ‘Those who live near water courses’, which was again true of the Goths. The Germanic ethnic identification symbols were also taken over from the local population, particularly the eagle, typical symbol of the steppe population, and also birds in general. We should also not forget th a t Gothic script, the so-called Runen, was a simplified M a gyar carved script. Its German name originated from the Hungarian word roni ‘to carve’. Thus, we should agree with the statem ent of Gyula Laszld, according to which “the scant upper class of the Goths, the conquering layer, underwent an almost complete transformation under the impact



of local traditions and customs” (P 087 pp. 161164). The modified social structure of the Goths and Gepids was one of the main reasons why they accepted to stay in the C arpathian land so readily even after the Hun conquest, faithfully serving their new king Attila. All th a t considerably modi fies the image we had of the migration of the Germanic peoples, a t least in the sector of south eastern Europe. It altogether confirms th at the aboriginal Hungarians could keep their own eth nic identity unchanged. A n d that was the most important feature of the Middle Danube basin on the eve of the coming of the Huns.
2. The coming o f the Huns
The Huns emerged in history as an Oriental people living on the pastures of the Oxus river valley, to the south of the Aral Sea. However, in the second century A.D., most of them had already skirted the southern end of the Caspian Sea and were in possession of the land above the Caucasus mountains up to the m outh of the Don river, the steppeland of former Scythia. Their westward move was prompted by fatal climatic changes which transformed their cradle-land (Touran) into a semi-desert. Increasing tem peratures resulted in a considerable reduction of the water supply and (he grass of the fields vanished. Thus the Huns, living from animal husbandry, had to move and



look for new grazing land. At the same time, as just mentioned, Germanic tribes were advancing eastwards on the great European Plain, by occupying more and more pasture, until they too had reached the river Don and came in direct contact with the Huns. Alarmed by their double misfortune, the Huns felt th at their very existence was being threatened and th at provoked their violent reaction. Under their first great king Balamber, they attacked the Ostro-Goths, their nearest adversaries, and swiftly broke their power. The Ostrogothic ruling class took refuge in Pannonia and proceeded to Italy a little later. The bulk of the Gothic population, however, submitted to the Huns and was incorpo rated into their politico-military system as a sepa rate entity under its own leaders. The next Germanic tribal federation, the Visi-Goths, located on the northern bank of the Lower Danube, seeing the defeat of their brethren, offered no resistence, but gave up their land, crossed the Danube and entered into the Roman Empire. Thus, the Huns, with a single sweeping action, arrived at the foot hills of the C arpathian m ountains in 375 A.D. Immediately thereafter, the Huns began plan ning the occupation of the last western segment of the great Eurasian steppeland, the Carpathian Lowland, inside the mountainous arc, by conclud ing pacts and alliances with their kindred tribes: the Yazigues in the Danube-Tisza quadrangle, the Skirs ( = Sikeli) in the western half of the country.



the Carpodari in Upper Hungary, as well as with the Romans themselves, whose famous general Aetius became their most im portant ally. By vir tue of these multiple alliances, the Huns gained control of the whole basin inside the Carpathians, without employing military force. Since the land was given over to Hun sovereignty peacefully, without war, and with the blessings of Rome, the local population had no particular reason to expeet hardship. It remained intact and offered its ser vices to the Hun king, a friend of Rome. The Huns set up their perm anent head-quarters in the heart of the land, at the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Maros, wherefrom King O ktar (-1-430), King Ruga ( + 434) and thereafter King A ttila (-1-453) governed their extensive empire. Thus, with the coming of the Huns, Roman and Germanic do minions in Central Europe were liquidated and the aborigines liberated.
Aetius continued to court the Huns, even after their installation in Hungary, encouraging them in their westward advance, in order to ease the Germanic pressure on the northern borders of the Roman Empire. For the Huns, the prospect of a possible extension of their sway upon the whole of Europe was an alluring offer, but, as it turned out, a miscalculation. King Attila was unable to win a clear victory in the great battle at Mauriacum, near Troyes, France, in 451. The immense efforts this war required in men and material, and the authoritarian manner Attila handled his sub



alterns, overstrained the socio-political structure of his realm. So, when Attila suddenly passed away in 453, his empire crumbled, in large p art because of the intrigues and rebellion of the Germanic tribes. A ttila’s sons were defeated in the struggle for the succession (455) and returned with their clans and kinsmen to Scythia, the tract of land above the Black Sea, beyond the Carpathian ranges. They did not, however, forget their ancient grandeur and Prince Csaba, the youngest son of Attila, as soon as he was back in the old country, began to spread the idea of an armed return to Pannonia (= Hungary), to take revenge upon the Germans, whom they considered as the main arti sans of their defeat. On his death-bed, he bound his people by oath, to return to Hungary, as soon as they had gathered enough strength, to rebuild a Hun state. Thus, the Huns did not disappear as it was sometimes surmised in certain historical books. They stayed in the immediate neighbour hood, waiting until the clock would strike the hour o f their return. This m om ent arrived in 568.
At th at time, a strong federation had come into being with the fusion of two great tribes: the Avari and Chunni consisting mostly of white Huns. The name Avari ( < H.: A var-i) means ‘He who comes from an embanked stronghold’, and Chunni ( < H.: Hun-i, i.e. Hon-i), Huns. J. Thury, a H un garian historian, established th a t 37 different sources identify the Avars ethnically as Huns (P 059 pp. 113,128). In the Carpathian basin, they



mainly occupied the Great Central Plain and Transdanubia and also considerable parts of present-day Austria and Dalmatia. The Avars kept their empire and their independence until 796, when they were defeated by the Franks under Charlemagne, who destroyed their State, whereby the pendulum swing, once again, westward.
3. The ethnic identity o f the Huns
The true identity of the Huns has not yet been clearly established: “We know nearly nothing about their early history” and “the history of A ttila is still to be w ritten” (P 061 p. 127). Our evidence on the anthropological build-up of this nation is scanty, because the Huns cremated their dead, thereby leaving no direct anthropological traces of them. Hence, w hat we know about them comes mostly from second-hand records. In con temporary and later accounts, the Huns are said to be of mixed origins, like all nations with an Oriental background. A m ajor proof of this, as is usually pointed out, was their skin colour which was generally brownish, although there were typi cal white Huns as well. Their colour difference subsisted even in the fourth and fifth centuries, which indicates th at the fusion of the two racial elements of this people had not yet been achieved at th at time. This state of their ethnic evolution explains why they were not only called by their



common name Huni, but also by other names which emphasize their racial origin. They were called Kush when their darkish colouring was more evident (P 092 pp. 14 f., 19-22), andA o'O 'is ( < H.: Uri, Ari), when the white complexion predomi nated. King A ttila is described in the chronicles as a short-statured, darkish complexioned man, of haughty walking."''* The various appellations of the Huns all have some significance in the Hungarian language. Their most frequent H uni (< H.: Hon-i) name, often written w ithout H as Unni, Uni, means ‘He who lives in the same land’, i.e. who is a native of the country, a compatriot. It is a geographic and political term, irrespective of racial origin, as were also the previously analysed names of M a gyar, Hungar, Siculi and Kelti. Thus, the main connecting link amongst all these peoples was their common Hungarian language and their identical Oriental origin. Therefore, they mixed easily, once they were placed under a same sovereignty. And there can be no m istake if A ttila is referred to as the King of H ungary {rex Hungariae), since the Huni were considered as Hungarians {Huni sive Hungari).
In addition to their general names (Huns, Kush, Hungarians) the various factions of this people
50. “Erat enim rex Ethele colore teter, oculis nigris et furiosis, pectore lato, elatus incessu, statura brevis, barbam prolixam cum Hunnis deferebat” (P 120 I p. 151).



also came under local d e n o m in a tio n s.T h e se secondary names were mainly noticed after the collapse of the Hun Empire, when several smaller political entites came into being. These names usually included the distinctive word -Ag-Ur ‘R uler of the branch so and so’. Examples: KutziAg-Ur, Hun-Ag-Ur, Sdr-Ag-Ur. The ethnic iden tity of the Huns is nevertheless best evidenced by their own written records, which we discovered and which we are now going to analyse in more detail.
4. Hun-symbols and w ritten records
It is often assumed th a t the Huns were an illiterate, barbaric people who left no written records. This opinion actually stems from the inability of scholars to identify and decipher their script. In fact, as shown below, the Huns be queathed us with a considerable am ount of written records, most of which turned up in Hungary, the one-time centre of their vast empire. Apart from sources of archaeological provenance, diplomatic records also mention their ability to write and to read. We have, in this respect, the rare testimony of Priscos Rhetor, one of the most credible ob
51. Author Agathias writing about the Hunnorum Gens says this: “Hi vero omnes communiter Scythae et Hunni vocabantur, privatim autem, secundum nationes alii aliter ex patria cuique et usita appellatione nominabantur”, quoted by P 092 p. 130.



servers of the Huns, who led an embassy to the court of King Attila. He mentions in his report th at the King requested the extradition of certain fugitive Huns, whose names he read out in his presence from sm all wooden sticks, from the By zantine emperor. Another proof of the Huns’ writ ing abihty is the fact th a t the incised or carved script was always called a “Hun writing”, “Hun letters” and “Alphabet of the H uns” in Hungary. The legend about illiterate Huns must be aban doned. Most existing Hun inscriptions have gold as supporting material and as such display a solemn character. But the daily records which Priscos Rhetor himself had mentioned were made on wood or on other perishable material, which deteriorated and are now lost for ever. Another preliminary question to be answered is whether the existing Hun inscriptions, especially those engraved upon expensive materials, could have really belonged to them at all. We have no reason to doubt this, since our historical sources are positive in stating th at the Hun kings were, in general, fond of gold, like all Oriental rulers. We read in these records th a t A ttila’s dining table was made of solid gold, and his cooking dishes were also of g o l d . T h e same sources mention the existence of a huge Hun golden treasure, which later on became the prop
52. “Mensa erat tota aurea, vasa etiam coquinaria aurea erant”, - records Simon de Keza (P 120 I p. 262).



erty of the Hungarian kings by law of succession and was always kept in Hungary, at the royal court. The treasure included the legendary sword of Attila, the so-called Sword of God, implying A ttila’s divine origin. Moreover, Hungarian medi eval charters certify that Ottokar H of Bohemia was asked to restitute all the gold to the King of Hungary, which his grandmother, Ann of Masovia, unlawfully carried away from Hungary to Bohemia. Amongst these precious jewels “was an expensive gold dish, adorned with the finest and most beautiful precious stones, as well as many other famous jewels, which were kept in Hungary from the time of Attila, king of Hungary, and his successors until now."-''^ The listed d ata dispel even the slightest doubt one may have that Attila had been the owner of gold dishes and other precious jewels, which were inscribed. On the following pages we will show a few Hun symbols, to begin with, which were used for the purpose of identifying the ruler by means of homo phony, i.e. the pictorial m ethod of writing which was common to all Oriental rulers during Antiqui ty. A ttila’s best known such symbol was the AstUr bird, whose image he wore on his shield. This word sounds like Est-Ura, ‘Ruler of the W est’. This title may have originated from the time when he was only ruHng the western half of the Hun
53. Clenodia aurea que a tempore regis Ungariae Attila et ab aliis successoribus suis usque nunc in Ungaria fuerant conservata” (P 099 p. 187 f.).



Empire, his brother Bleda having been in charge of the eastern part. Furthermore, Attila was also called God’s Whip, which is another play on sound for the same title, whip being Ostor in Hungarian, homophonic with Est-Ur. Finally, a widely used Hun badge was the stylized insect having the outlines of a bee (H.: Meh), which identified its bearer (Ur, Ar), as M eh-Ar, i.e. M ahar or M a gyar. Another group of Hun-identifying objects con sisted of quadrupeds: mostly dogs, foxes, and wolves. They were used as totems, designating the clan from which they had originated. On the basis of such assumed names, certains Huns could have considered themselves as “Sons of the Dog” or “Sons of the Fox”. King Ruga was probably ‘Fox’ (H.: Roka), while King Oktar may have been ‘Mr. Dog’ (H.: A kutya ur). T he speech of the Huns, especially their battle-cry, was said to re semble “the roaring of Hons” (P 099 pp. 64, 147, 178).^->
54. It should be noted, once again, that the ancient royal Egyptian symbols also included the bird, the whip and the bee.
55. Incidentally, ancient Egyptian kings had the same cus tom: “The warrior kings of the XVIIIth and X lX th Dynasties were pleased when the court scribes related in commemorative inscriptions how their lords raged and roared like lions as they mounted their chariots and set out to crush the foolish enemy” (P 026 I p. 25 f.)



The author has deciphered several of the Hun inscriptions which are engraved upon gold dishes, found at Nagy-Szent-Mikl6s, to the south of the river Maros, which was the central district of the Hun Empire. The cache was discovered in 1791 and yielded 23 pieces (dishes, juges, goblets, etc.), all made of soHd gold, weighing altogether 9,925 gr. The commodities were probably not for everyday use, because they are conserved in alm ost perfect condition, without any trace of wear or tear. It is likely th a t the purpose of these jewels was rather to preserve im portant historical messages for the progeny, like royal records. In addition to the individual inscriptions, five richly adorned vessels (numbered 9, 10, 17, 22 and 23) bear an identical short script. It always reads from right to left and was written in memory of the goldsmith who made the decorations: pictures and interwoven figures. The script (Fig. 32) reads in Hungarian thus: aR-U Ke-Pe.T 1 T.eR.eK U.N CSi-Na.Ta, in present Hungarian orthography: Arii kepet egy derek hun csindlta, in English: ‘The adornm ent of this article was made by a skilled Hun.’

A longer inscription appears on a gold tray (Fig. 33), marvellously adorned with a Tree of Life (genealogical tree), flanked on both sides by two stylized attendant animals. In the higher ranking position there are two dog-like creatures with pointed ears, and on the second one are two quadripeds with birds’ beaks. The picture may point out the two major Magyar-speaking peoples of Hungary at th at time: Huns and Magyars.

It was executed with great care, no doubt because it was King O ktar’s royal seal, bearing his full title. We shall not enter into discussing the complicated meaning of the cross-sign, but only of the script itself, which reads counter-clockwise, starting at the 12 o’clock position. The transliteration of the signs is thus: Ne.Te.T.I-K uN Ki.Rd O.K.T.aR O.R-SZ-E-EGe A.Ra-K Jo.K-oN Ve-Te P-A.RaTo.K-T-O(l) Po.N-T.I-aK I.SZ.T(er) Vi-Te.Ki-EK O.Ra-Li-aK To.T-oK U-RA.

He bought it from friends by heredi tary right. He is the ruler of those living above the Pontus (= the Black Sea), in the Ister (= Danubian) region, in the Ural area and of the Slavonic peoples.’ The last Hunnic inscription we will be discussing was found outside Hungary. It is incised on the pendant of a necklace found in Wolfheim, Rhein land. The name of the village where it was found, signifies the ‘Dwelling Place of Wolves’, a typical Hun designation. The relic comes, in all probabil ity, from a group of Huns who found refuge there after the collapse of their Empire. The message on it was preparaed with philological precision

The contemporary written documents of the Huns constitute the decisive evidence that these people were literate, having strong cultural rela tions with ancient Egypt, and spoke Hungarian. Their records repeatedly say that they originated from the Ancient Near East (Iran), and had acquired their Carpathian land peacefully, by virtue of diplomatic accords.

5. The bad image o f the Huns in Western Europe
After all we have said about the Huns, the question th a t comes to mind is how could they have had such bad press in western Europe to this day. This hatred is focussed mainly upon King Attila, the most brilliant figure of his race, second ly, upon the Hun people themselves. As is disclosed from the analysis regarding this subject (P 099 and P 072), chronicler Jordanes, a man of Gothic descent, started the defamation. It was he who invented the tale th at Attila was not a hum an being, but rather a monster, horn from the love of a dog and a witch and had a doglike appearance (canis aspersus), with pointed ears. This monster image has come into circula tion, in all probability, through misinterpretation of the Hun custom of using animal symbols to indicate their tribal or national appurtenance. So, when the Huns said th at they originated from a wolf or a dog, the naive western priests and chronicle-writers took these expressions literally, and justified their abhorrent image with the H uns’own words. The H uns’ monster image was confirmed by a second feature, namely th at God had selected the Hun king to fulfill the ungrateful mission to be



God’s whip (flagellum Dei), a kind of Anti-Christ, to punish, especially the Latin peoples, for their wickedness and crimes. This second gossip origin ated obviously from the misinterpretation of the H uns’ original symbol, the whip, which in their symbolism, m eant simply th at Attila was the ruler of West, as explained above. Thus the whip in the hand of Attila had as little to do with a punishing mission as the one in the hands of Egyptian Pharaohs. If Jordanes, this first western propagan dist, could have had the opportunity to travel throughout the Hun Empire, he probably would have avoided spreading so much inconsistency amongst his countrymen. Herodotus, almost a thousand years earlier, did his reportage on the Scythians more conscientiously. He spared no trouble and travelled to Olbia, on the Black Sea shore, to gather firsthand information. The de scription of Priscos R hetor is similarly much more accurate because he had met Attila personally. Ordinary Huns were also heaped with slander. It was asserted th a t they were subhum an beings, the descendants of Scythian witches and of unspe cified devils, and th a t their way of life consisted only of looting, perpetrating robberies and killings. And their speech? Oh, they did not have any, their m outh could only give out short and inarticulate sounds like fleeing anim als.’’*’ This latest Hun-fea

ture also originated from the miscomprehension of the metaphor, according to which the Hun battle-cry was likened to the roaring of Uons, as the ancient Egyptian kings have done when in battle. To sum up, all the interpretations the Westerners invented reflect their naivety, lack of experience and a great deal of bad faith.
The Hun armies never sacked Rome, the holy city of Christendom, although they could have done so in 452, having arrived a t the gates of the City. In the western interpretation this was not due to A ttila’s orders, but to a miracle: the apostles Peter and Paul appeared with shining sabres above A ttila’s head, and this sight frightened the wouldbe robber who fled. Thereafter, the lucky city was, however, repeatedly robbed and burned by Ger manic tribes. First by the Visi-Goths of Alaric in 410 A.D., and then by the Vandals of Gaiseric in 455, when the two saintly apostles failed to pull out their sabres to chase away the real robbers. But such arguments would carry no weight with the makers of myths who persisted in their behef that with the Huns, the scum of Earth had inun dated Europe. The traditional Hun-phobia of medieval western writers clouded the clairvoyance of the modern historians as well who were unable to reason otherwise and saw in A ttila the prototype of the Barbar: the uncut, savage man who built nothing and destroyed everything for the sake of destruc tion. They forget that the mass-murderer Julius



Caesar was the true scourge of God in Antiquity, and th at the words Vandal and VandaHsm, were not a Hunnic, but of western origin. Fortunately, Hungarian historians have never accepted the Hun-image elaborated by their western colleagues. For them. King Attila was the first great Magyar ruler in Europe, who liberated their forefathers from the western yoke, stopped both Roman and Germanic penetration, and rolled back the in vaders of the Carpatho-Danubian basin thus pre serving the precious ethnic and political equilib rium in central Europe. Hungarian historians, also, did not ignore the military genius of Attila, and stated emphatically, that the Huns had not only a highly developed culture, but th a t they had doubtlessly surpassed western civilization which was at th at time, in its darkest “dark age” (deca dence of the Roman and Byzantine empires). Even Charlemagne, the great Frankish ruler, could not sign his name. We have to admit, however, th at the western historians of today are m aking efforts to form a more truthful view o f the Huns, bringing it more into harmony with our modern scholarly stan dards. After this cleansing operation, all the incredi ble features of the Hun-portrait have been dis carded, notably those concerning the Huns’ monstruous origin, their animal language and their so-called earthly mission. B ut it will be some time until past conventional wisdom is replaced by the results of modern research. As an illustration of

this process, we read, in a recent publication, the admission th at “the threat which they (the Huns) had posed to western civiUzation has probably been exaggerated” (P 104 p. 69). German authors recognize th at the Huns, as body-guards, were more rehable than their own fellow countrymen.^^ It shall also be noted that, after all, the central figure of the German sagas was precisely Attila (cf. Nibelungen-lied). Germans even w ant to claim that Attila was one of their kinsmen, his name being a Germanic word, meaning something like “D addy”."^^It is really high time that the distorted image of the Huns, this dark blot on western historiography, make way for some more serious consideration, wherein the great-power status of the Huns and their world-empire are acknowl edged and appreciated at their proper value.

THE MAGYAR HUNGARIANS
1. Massive influx of Magyars into the Carpathian Land and the birth of Hungary-I
After the collapse of the Hun rule in Hungary (453), the m ajor Germanic tribes of the country —Goths, Gepids and Longobards (the latter since 526 only), — set up individual principalities and quarreled violently amongst themselves. The Lon gobards were striving for predominance but, not having the necessary strength to achieve it, asked a Hun faction of Eastern Europe to help them defeat their rivals. With the support of this Ma gyar tongued faction called Avari (Avars), the Longobards drove out the Gepids, but felt so insecure in their domain th at they deemed it advisable to evacuate Hungary. They actually fled to Italy in 568, together with their families. After that, the Avar Hungarians set up their own king dom (568-803) in the entire Carpathian area. At the beginning, the Avar Kingdom extended from the Don in the E ast to the Enns in the West. Later it shrank and covered only the Carpathian basin, the Vienna Plain and the Bohemian Pla teau.



There was much speculation about the ethnic identity of the Avars. But it seems certain that they already spoke Hungarian when they first appeared on the scene of history. Their name A vari ( < H.: A var-i) means, indeed ‘Those who live in enclosures (Rings)’. And the throne-nam e of their first great ruler, under whose leadership they entered the Carpathian land, was Bajdn ( < H.: Be-Jon), a homophon of ‘He who comes in’. More information is available about the ethnic identity of the second Avar ethnic wave (670), composed of “W hite H ungarians”, as is definitely stated in the Russian chronicle of Nestor. The vastness of Magyar human material th at settled thus in Hungary a t th a t time is reflected by the great number of their graves which have been excavated, 40,000. The newcomers occupied the edges of the Great Central Plain, and Transdanubia, and also southern Hungary, i.e. the best arable lands of the country. The seat of their government was in Gyor ( < H.: Gyiiru = ‘Ring’), a strategi cally located and well fortified stronghold a t the confluence of the Raba river and the Danube. The Hungarian chroniclers never use the term Avar when speaking about them. They call them simply Hungarians, as do the majority of W est-European chronicles as well. They add, a t best, a few adjec tives for the sake of a clarification, like “Avars who are called Hungarians” (Avari qui dicuntur Ungari); “Avars who are called Huns and H ungar ians as well” {Avari qui et Huni sive Hungari).



By the same token, un Avar king is mentioned with the title of “King of Hungary”. The latter has been a famous ruler because his daughter Berthe became the wife of Pepin and subsequently the mother of Charlemagne. The quoted data clearly suggest th a t from 670 onwards, the M a gyars already formed a united nation in the Carpatho-Danubian basin and had an organized State headed by kings. T h at was a historical event, and this explains why Prince Arpad could set up a smoothly working State-apparatus so easily after his entry into the land. For him, the help of the Hungarians in the Rings was inevaluable. The Avar-Hungarian kingdom lasted for about two and a half centuries. Afterwards, the reorgan ized Frank Empire resumed past Germanic expan sion toward the E ast under the half-Hungarian Charlemagne (771-814) who organized a series of razzias against Hungary between 796 and 803 and destroyed its central government. Charlemagne was not much interested in territorial gains. He preferred to loot the Rings, where the nation’s treasures —gold, silver and precious stones —were guarded. On a single occasion, for example, he ‘collected’ so much treasures th a t 14 wagons were needed to cart them away from Hungary. Chron icler Eginard (Einhard) commented on th a t big haul by saying: “According to hum an memory, there was no earlier war in which the Franks have become as wealthy as just now; for until now, they were poor” (cf. P 098 pp. 113, 240).



As regards the M agyar population of Avar-Hungary, it survived the loss of their S tate and contin ued to live alm ost undisturbed. The largest adm in istrative unit which continued to function was that located around Lake Ferto, a rather swampy re gion in western Hungary. It was last mentioned in 873. A second surviving m ini-state was the realm of Tudun, in Upper Hungary. This one endured until the coming of Arpad in 895. The harm ful consequence of Frankish incursions into Hungary was the creation of a politico-military vacuum in a so vitally strategic pa rt of Central Europe, which caused a lot of inconveniences both to the local population and to the Germans as well. Therefore, emissaries were sent to the East-European Arpad Hungarians even by the German king Arnulf who urged them to come in to help stabilize the situa tion. The craving for a new unifier was fulfilled in 895, with the entry on the scene o f Prince Arpad. His coming opened a new chapter in Central Europe’s history.
2. Hungary’s ethnographic and political conditions in the IXth century
1. In the previous chapters we have explained how Magyar-speaking ethnic groups continuously poured into the Carpathian land, ever since Neo lithic times. They came in successive waves, in increasing numbers and under various denomina tions: Magyars, Szekely, Kush, Scythians, Celts, Huns, Avars, etc. Their common starting point was



the Ancient N ear-East and they were linked by ethnic, cultural and linguistic ties. This morpholo gical coherence of the early Hungarians is proba bly the most im portant discovery in our recent historical science.^'^ Now, it will be interesting to find out whether the earliest population and its descendants were still evident in the IX th century, a t the eve of Arpad’s coming. A first indication of the presence of Magyars is th a t the m ountain-, river- and village-names they had imparted to the geographic features of the land were still all in use. Furtherm ore, their identification symbols: the bird, the bee, the lion and the ram were also deeply embedded in the folklore, which was strongly impregnated with suncult and with general Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Syrian connections. All th at would be impos sible to explain without the continuous presence of the same population and, w hat is more, several other reliable sources especially mention the pre sence of Hungarians in the land at the said time. During the reign of Charlemagne’s successors, for example, a bishop Hungarus by name, is m en tioned in a charter of 888, and Louis the German,
59. The Swiss anthropologist E. Pittard was one of the first scientists to suspect the close affinity of the early inhabitants of Hungary. He said; «I1 est probable, a voir les caractdres morphologiques des habitants de la Hongrie, que parmi les peuples qui arrivaient de I'Est, il y en avait plusieurs qui etaient puises aux memes fonds ethniques que les Magyars eux-memes» (P 103 p. 341).



for his part, refers to a m ountain called Marca Vengeriorum, in his charter of 860 and even C har lemagne had several times referred to a Hungarian stronghold in Transdanubia, Sdrvdr by name (P 059 pp. 241-242). And, above all, there is a recently discovered Hungarian chronicle which survived through a Turkish translation (XVIth century), which states th at the Hungarians of Arpad were greatly pleased to learn, upon their arrival in th at country, th at its inhabitants spoke the same language as they did. T hus it is evident th at Hungary was already populated with H un garian-speaking people before the coming of Arpad. 2. Anonymus, our best informer on the IX th century events, records in his Gesta Hungarorum (c. 1200), th a t the Arpadians, upon entering the Carpathian basin, had found a large population there whom he calls Sclaui, Ram eni and Blachi. Scholars have been baffled by these names he alone mentions, all the more since the proffered explana tions led to chronological and linguistic absurdi ties. Who were these peoples? The etymological approach gives us the first im portant key to this mystery. The Sclaui name, to begin with, is a Hungarian compound word which includes the following elements; S-K-Lau-i. At its ending we notice the adjectival suffix -i, usually meaning ‘Follower o f, ‘Coming from’. The word Lau, which precedes the suffix, is the dialectal form of the literary Ld, whose first meaning is ‘Horse’. In



ancient times, however, the Sungod was m eant by it, who was imagined as riding upon a horse in the sky.'**’ The remaining part of the word, S-K, when vocahsed appears as As ^ k , or in softened form: A z ^ g , and means ‘The Sky’. T hus the whole compound S-K-Lau-i = A z Egi L6-i means liter ally ‘Follower of the Heavenly God’, i.e. sunworshippers. Consequently, the form Sclaui is not an ethnic denomination, but a religious one, meaning simply sunworshippers.
The Sclaui dwelt all over the land, but their main settlem ent areas were in Transdanubia and in Upper Hungary. Now, these regions were exact ly the same ones where the Szekely-Hungarians (Sikeli, Sikeloi, Siculi) lived until their partial transfer into Transylvania. Incidentally, their name includes the very same three consonants, S-K-L, which are to be found in the name of
60. Several examples can be listed to prove that Horae (Lau) was used to say Ra, the Sungod. In the Zagros moun tains, to the east of Mesopotamia, there w£is a small country called Lauristan (<H .: L6-Ur-Isten), ‘Land placed under the protection of the Horse-Lordgod’ i.e. Sungod. It was the unique task of the Scythians who lived in that country to raise horses for the Persian armies. Their popular art was also overladen with horse representations. - Another example: The Armenian bishop, Israyel, who travelled into the land of the Huns and describe their beliefs, said this: “The Huns wor shipped their highest divinity in the form of a giant warrior, mounted on horseback” (P 081 p. 65). - The Hungarian AU sound usually changes into O, £is in the city-name of Iglau, which is in modem Hungarian, Igl6.



S-K-Lau-i. Furtherm ore, in the present-day Szekely local language the word Ld (horse) is often pronounced as Lau, and means, when used as a title, not horse, but Lord, as in the nobihary title L6-F6 ‘Highborn Man, M arquis’. Finally, the Sikeh were also ardent worshippers of the Sun and their popular art is full of the symbols of the ancestral suncult. T heir name, in the form used two thousand years earlier, was also analyzed as signifying ‘Follower of the Heavenly Lord’. Upon the basis of so many similarities, we must concede that Anonymus had, no doubt, meant that group of Hungarian-speaking people under the word Sclaui, which was mentioned in earlier sources as Sikeloi, i.e. the present-day Szekely, a group probably originating from the Mesopotamian cul tural sphere.
According to Anonymus’ narration, the Rameni were natives of Transdanubia. Their name con tained the following components: Ra-Men-i, a fine Old H ungarian word, meaning ‘Follower of the Divine StaUion’, i.e. again sunworshippers, but this time of Egyptian persuasion. This term proba bly m eant a Hun faction (Huni or Honi = ‘Native’), whose name he renders in Latin as habitatores terrae. — The third group of Hungari ans mentioned by Anonymus in their religious context were the Blachi who used the carved script to write, remarks the chronicler. This fact alone strongly suggests th at they originated from the Syrian cultural sphere. Their name confirms it.



since its etymological meaning is the Hungarian B al-Lak-i ‘Originating from B aal’s Dwelling’, Baal being the Syrian Divinity of Fire’, a local variant of sunworshippers. They are also called Balasi or Blasi, a synonym meaning ‘He who comes from B aal’s House’. There are many Hungarian placenames compounded with the divine name Baal, such as Bala, Balaton, Bala-var, Balvanyos, Belko, etc. The same name occurs outside Hungary, in such well known geographic names as the Balkan Peninsula, the Baltic Sea and region, Belgium, etc. Julius Caesar mentions in his De bello Gallico th at Volok (Volcae) people were living, together with Rutheni, on the northern foothills of the Pyrenees (P 030 H p. 36 and Index and map). T h a t all these groups of peoples were mentioned in their religious connections is revealed by a rem ark by Anonymus, a Christian priest, who said th at the Sclaui and Blachi were the most wicked people of the whole world, simply because they served pagan divinities (viliores homines esse totius mundi quia essent Blasii et Sclaui, P 120 I p. 66).
The continuous use of Near-Eastern religious names is an obvious proof th a t the descendants of the NeoHthic and Bronze Age inhabitants of Hungary still formed the bulk of the population in the IX th century A.D. Nonetheless, it is impos sible to make an approximate calculation about their numerical strength on the eve of Arpad’s coming. We can only guess their relative impor tance, on the basis of a specific archaeological fact:



from the late Avar period, Hungary has 40,000 authentic excavated graves, whereas from the period of the reunification of the land under Arpad, we only possess 10,000. T h at would mean th a t the proportion of long settled Hungarians to the Arpadian newcomers, was 4 to 1. The survival o f H u n garians of diverse religious affiliations in the Danube basin since the Neolithic and Bronze Ages makes them the most ancient inhabitants of Europe, who were capable of preserving their original ethnic, linguistic and cultural identity throughout millenia.
3. To complete our survey of the situation in the Danube basis toward the end of the IX th century, before the arrival of the last major H un garian ethnic wave, we m ust take a look at the political build up of the land. It was a chaotic one, because after the destruction of the AvarHungarian S tate in 803, the country’s organiza tion, in the absence of a central government, relapsed to tribalism and regionalism. In north-western or Upper Hungary, there existed a small post-Avar principality centred around the fortress of Nyitra and well protected by high mountains. Its existence was continuously men tioned in historical annals until 875, date of its conversion to Christianity. Upper H ungary’s most famous ruler was Prince Tudun, whose name is last mentioned in a charter of Pope Eugene II in 826, wherein he was admonished for building Christian churches (P 109 II p. 35). T udun is an



Oriental throne-name ( < H.; Tud6-(H )0na: I'oth-Hon) meaning ‘Land of God T h o t’ (the I’lgyptian divinity). At the time of the re-unificaI ion of the country under Arpad, the ruler of th a t region was Prince Zobor (< H .: Az Avar) meaning ■'Phe Avar ruler’.
South o f Upper Hungary, up to the River Raba, and including the Ferto Lake, lay a second postAvar principality. Its administrative centre was (Ivor ( =H .: Gyiirii ‘Ring’). Other minor principa lities were around Lake Balaton. All these western Hungarian post-Avar principalities were given more freedom of action after the division of the Frank Empire into three nationally based political entities in 843. They utilized their liberty by seek ing help from their fellow Hungarians, beyond the Carpathian arc, in Eastern Europe.
The Great Central Plain of Hungary was under the nominal sovereignty of the Bulgarian Empire and was governed by native princes. At its south ern end, in the Danube-Tisza quadrangle, lived the Alan people called Yazigues; they were obe dient to Prince Salan (< H . Az Alan) ‘The Alan’. The separate identity of the Yazigues had already been erased in the Hun period, but their adminis trative autonom y subsisted until 1848. The north ern portion of the Central Plain was under the authority of another local prince, Laborci by name, who ruled from his fortress-city of Hungvdr, ‘Hun Fortress’, according to Anonymus.



To the east of the Tisza, extending up to the Carpathians three small principalities flourished. The strongest of them ruled in the region of Szamos and Koros, with a m ihtary base in the mountain fortress of Bihar. The last ruler of this principality was Men-Marut, whose throne-name m eant ‘Sungod’s Stallion’ (Men = Stallion; M aruth = the Hindu name of the Sungod). This monarch lived in Oriental fashion, he even sported a harem a t his court, and ruled over a mixed population called Chozari (< H .: Kos-Ar-i). The second eastern Hungarian ruler. Dux Gelu or Gyula, governed the Upper Maros area in Ultransylvania, ‘Beyond the forested L and’, his throne-seat being at Gyalu. He was probably a priest-king, whose symbol, a torch, was carried before him when he travelled officially (P 120 I p. 95). Another high official of this petty kingdom identified himself by wearing a sun-disk. The last Gyula maintained his quasi-sovereign status until the reign of King St. Stephen (1000-1038), who had him captured and imprisoned for life, “because he was an inveterate pagan, refusing to become a Christian and was, in many ways, an annoyance to St. Stephen”, writes Anonymus. — The third and last east -Hungarian petty kingdom included the area bounded by the rivers Maros, Tisza and the Lower Danube, with a royal residence at Orsova (= Ur Szava) ‘Voice of the R uler’, like the post-H ittite state in the Ancient Orient, Arzawa. The Prince’s name in Latin script was Glad



<•1 ('lad; it is the softened form of the original Hungarian word Keleti, i.e. ‘O riental’. As has been proven in the foregone analysis, all ili(> princes and their petty kingdoms mentioned III the historical sources of the IX th century defin itely bore Hungarian names and ruled over a Hungarian-speaking population. Prof. Janos Melich, a very conscientious linguist, came to the same conclusion in his last im portant scientific paper (P 097). He re-examined the pre-Arpadian l)iince-list and found th at M enmarut and Glad were certainly native Magyars and th at all the other local rulers spoke “faultless Magyar”. He also stated th a t the great majority o f H ungary’s population spoke H ungarian on the eve o f A rp a d ’s coming and was racially inter-related.
3. The formation of the Arpadian people in Eastern Europe
Recent historical studies emphasize that the human mass led by Arpad into the Carpatho-Danubian basin, significantly differed from those H un garians already living in th at country. The Arpadians evolved, indeed, their ethnic constitution during the sixth to the ninth centuries only, by merging with westward-moving Hungarian and Turkish peoples, on the Eastern European Plain. This all began with the sudden entry of the Turks into the Caspian-Oxus-Aral area in 568 A.D. T h at first blow was followed by a second and more



violent one in 597-598. As a result, all the tribes living in the southwestern comer of the great Eurasian steppe began to roll westwards. The Turks were mostly stock-breeding, m ount ed nomads of inner Asiatic origin, having various independent branches, Uke the Bisseni, Chasari and Cumani, to mention only those with whom the Magyars were to come into closer contact. They had their own language, which has borrowed heavily from the Hungarian vocabulary, and which, most likely, also included their historical names. In fact, their names seem to have been given by Hungarians, since they all have a definite meaning in th at language. The word Turki (anc. form: Tourki), seems to have resulted from the merging of four elements into a single word; T6Ur-Ko-i, meaning literally ‘Those who dwell (-i), in the Land (Ko), of the Ruler (Ur) of the Lake (To)’, in short ‘Lake Dwellers.’ The implied lake was no doubt, the Aral Sea, because it is surround ed by a lowland called Touran ( < H.: T6-UrHon), ‘Home of the Lake Lord’. The name Bisseni, Pissoni or Pice-Nati ( < H.: Pis-Hon-i; today: Viz-Honi) means ‘He who lives by the W ater’; and Pice-Nati, in inverted word order ( < H.: NagyViz-i) ‘He who lives by the Large W ater’, probably referring to the Caspian Sea, for originally they had actually lived on its shores. As regards the Chasars (Khazari, Chosari) their name is a com pound with Kos -t-Ar -hi, i.e. descendants from the merging of (white) Aryans and (darkish) Kush



peoples, as rightly observed by the Arab writer, \l)ii-i-Feda, who said: “The Khazars... are of two iv|)es: some are dark-skinned, often almost black; I licse are considered as being of Hindu descent. The second race is white-skinned and exceedingly iKHutiful” (quoted in P 081 p. 56). In the begin ning, the Khazars dwelt on the northern shore <>l the Caspian Sea, whose original ‘H yrcania’ ( = Aryan) name was changed into Caspis ( < H.: Kush-Viz) ‘W ater of the K ush’. All this points to I he im portant fact th a t the Turki peoples were (I combination o f the subjugated A ryan and Kush population, with a significant admixture of M on gol elements.
The first Turkish ethnic branch with which the Arpadians came into close pohtical union were the Khazars, as was recently demonstrated by Arthur Koestler (P 079) and Vilmos Kovacs (P 081). The Khazars spoke the Tchuvash dialect of Turkish and had laid the foundation of their empire in the second half of the V lth century, more exactly in ■)67. They became the mightiest power in Eastern Europe in the V llth, V lllth and IX th centuries, rhey had extended their domain over the entire area to the north of the Caucasian ranges, and subjected the westermost seven Magyar tribes, living between the K uban and Don rivers, to their rule, as well as those who dwelt between the Kuma and Terek rivers, on the western coast of the Caspian. All these Magyar tribes living in Cauca sia, originated from northern Mesopotamia, the



Kingdom of Urartu, and from the post-Hittite states of Syria, especially from the Kingdoms of Arpad, Karkemish and Damasek (Damask). They had to leave their old fatherlands, following the bloody expansion of the Semitic Assyrian Empire, in the second and first milleniums B.C. In our historical sources, the memory of the Hungarians at the Don has been preserved under the name of Dentu-Magaria and of those of the Kuma valley as Kum-Magaria.
The Hungarians of Dentu-Magaria have been incorporated into the K hazar Empire in 568 A.D. and their symbiosis lasted for over three hundred years. They were entrusted with the all-im portant task of safeguarding the western flank of the Khazar Empire and to block the descent of the Slavonic peoples toward the south. To fulfill their duties more efficaciously, the seven M agyar tribes in question were transferred later to a more suit able location, between the Don and Dnieper, above the Black Sea. The same strategic considerations led the Khazars to place the Magyar tribes under a single command, for which Arpad was selected. His installation as ‘Deputy king’ was carried out according to Khazar customs, by elevating him on shields. And the leaders of the seven tribes, for their part, swore allegiance to Arpad, solemnly declaring th a t they would faithfully carry out his orders. All th a t may have happened around 850, which may be considered the birth-date of the East-European Hungarian nation, the Danubian



one having already been in existence for a long
I mu*.
'The K hazar-H ungarian alliance worked well for ;il»()ut two hundred years, but when the K hazar kill},' adopted the Judaic faith around 740 and IDiced it upon his court and m ilitary men, the first internal tensions were quick to appear. A civil war riu p ted in which the rebels were defeated. As a rr.sult, three deeply involved K hazar tribes, called Kabars, went over to Hungarian side and were ,il)sorbed into their socio-political system. Then I ame the renewed attack of the fearful BisseniI’urks, who had torn away the pasture-land from t he Magyars and forced them to move more wes1wards (889), into the Dnieper-Seret-Lower-Daniibe area, thereby severing their secular alliance with the Khazars completely. At th at time, they had already acquired enough political m aturity to make their own decisions as to the best way to ensure their survival in social surroundings th at were growing more and more precarious. Their own worry, which was also shared by the Danubian Hungarians, gave rise in c. 890 to the idea of merging the two Hungarian nations into one, inside the spacious Carpathian arena which could be defended more easily than any tribal community on the unbroken, vast plain beyond the Carpathians. In the meantime, they had to fight a mysterious battle against the Cuman-Turks near Kiev, of which we have no details. It is definitely known, however, th at the Cumans’



seven tribes were defeated and th at they swore an oath of allegiance to Arpad and then they too were absorbed into the constantly swelling M a gyar conglomerate, which already consisted of seventeen tribes. Finally, the descendants of Prince Csaba, the youngest son of King Attila, also joined the Arpadians, together with their innumerable clans and cognates of the same re gion. After all these happenings, the people Arpad led into Hungary were considerably different from the Danubian Hungarians. Racially, they were of Aryan, Kush and Mongolian factions. By religion, they were sunworshippers, fireadorers, Ismaelits and Moslems. Ethnically, they had strong Turkish traits, bearing such names as Magyar, Khazar, Kabar, Kuman, Hun, Bisseni, etc. —a real mosaic with a Turkish veneer. In the Byzantine court they were classified simply as Turki, and not Hungari ans. How did it happen then, th at they could, nevertheless, build a Hungary with all its compo nents and not a ‘T urkey’?



I. I'he re-unification of the country and the birth of Hungary-II as a modern state
I. After the destruction of the Avar-Hungarian Kingdom by the Franks in 783-803, the whole I '.irpathian land relapsed into a state of political iiiarchy and became a battlefield for half a dozen iliikedoms and neighbouring great powers. No wonder th at the Hungarians already in the land, li;i(l sent emissaries to their brethren on the other side of the Carpathians, urging them to move in If) rebuild, together with their united forces, the realm of their great ancestor, King Attila. The Ai padians received similar suggestions from the interested great powers, namely from King Amulf (M87-899) of Germany, and the Byzantine emperor Lc*on the Wise (886-912) to help achieve their own political objectives. By this means, the Arpadians luid several opportunities of exploring their future land, especially in 862, 881 and 892. A ll our evi dence points to the fact that the vital decision was already taken in 892.
The preparations for the conquest were in full swing at th at time. In Kiev, where Almus, the lather of Arpad was the deputy-king, all the avail able blacksmiths were summoned to make hundreds of thousands of horseshoes, arrows, cart wheels, swords and the like, which were all kept in storage. Three hundred lumber jacks were also



engaged to clear a passage through the thick forest. A pincer movement was planned, ac cording to which the bulk of the invaders would penetrate into Hungary under the leadership of Arpad through the Verecke-pass, which had never been used before (841 m above s.-l.), and the second army, under the command of Arpad’s fa ther Almus or his elder son Levente, was supposed to check the Bulgarian forces and penetrate into Transylvania through its passes and gorges. The invasion started in the spring of 895 and, except for the unexpected attack of the Bisseni and Bulgarians, the Hungarian armies met inside the Carpathian arc during the summer of the same year, as planned. B y 900, the entire territory was in their hands, including Transdanubia.
The incoming Arpadians were greeted as Hberators and most of the native populations surren dered spontaneously to the new master of the land and even helped with the unification. Those few princes and dukes who failed to change their allegiance in time, paid dearly for their mistake. Laborci, Gelu and Zubur who resisted, were killed in action. Two others, Salan and Glad, fled with their followers. The case of the sixth prince, Menm arut, was a particular one, insofar as he had wanted to resist at first, but, a t the sight of Arpad’s armed men, had asked for a compromise, offering his daughter in marriage to Arpad’s youngest son Zsolt, while he himself swore obedience to Arpad. In exchange, he was permitted to keep his strong



liold of Bihar as a fief for life. H istory knows of n /y few conquests as clean as A rp a d ’s, which was (tccomplished practically without bloodshed.
As soon as the territorial unification of the land was achieved, Arpad summoned the leaders to his fortress of Csongrad and hammered out the princi ples (‘C onstitution’), according to which the re unified country was to be governed. The next step consisted of setting up nation-wide institutions, lo bind all the inhabitants of Hungary together into indissoluble unity. These institutions were

almost exclusively, the creation of the native, and not of the half-way Turkized Hungarians. In other words, the newcomers were culturally absorbed into the Magyar-speaking local population which formed the overwhelming majority in the land. This process is well illustrated by the following remarks. The unified country became a “kingdom” (and not a khanat according to the Turkish pat tern), with a “king” as its ruler (and not a khan or kende). The highest officials were the Maior Domus Nddor and the Chief Justice, Orszdg-biro (and not Horka and Kddar). The king was repre sented as someone seated upon a throne (and not in a saddle on horseback). The symbolic animal identifying the king was a lion (and not a hyena, ram or dog). One of the most im portant institu tions, which welded and kept the various elements of the society together, resulted from the adoption of Christianity. The new faith imposed, indeed, a common and uniform ideology, and replaced the pagan Sun-, Fire-, and Baal-cults, which had earli er kept the nation divided into several parts. Thus, the merging of all Hungarians of diverse origins, creeds and political traditions into a single nation was achieved within a relatively short lapse of time.
2. Prince Arpad (-1-907) was not only a m ilitary genius but a successful organizer as well. He clear ly perceived the geographic unity and the strategic position of the Carpathian arena, welded between two powerful empires. Accordingly, he did not



divide the country amongst the seven princes who were his deputies. On the contrary, he considered the mountainous periphery of the united land as its natural defense line and the whole country as an im portant element of the European equilibrium, as set forth by the treaty of Verdun in 843. He was, therefore, anxious to put an end to the encroachments of the little Moravian State and incorporated its borderland into Hungary in 902. More fighting was needed before A rp a d ’s stra tegic-political conception was recognized and ac cepted by the Holy R om an Empire, H ungary’s dynamic western neighbour. This empire was nat urally inclined to expand eastward along the Dan ube valley. The most opportune time for the realization of its ambitions seemed to arrive with the death of Arpad, when huge armies were dispatched on both sides of the Danube toward Hungary. They were, however, defeated right at the border, in the marshy region of Pozsony (Presburg). As a result of this decisive Hungarian victo ry, the Danubian provinces of present-day Austria were annexed by Hungary as far as the river Enns. The whole area remained under Hungarian rule until 933, when one of their armies was defeated near Merseburg, and again in 955, near Augsburg. After these events, H ungary’s western borders were gradually withdrawn to the line of the Lajta and Fischa rivers, where they were stabilized for a thousand years and m utually recognized. After that, there was no obstacle for the participation



of Hungary under Prince Geza at the meeting of Quedlinburg (973), called in by the German em peror Otto the Great, to discuss the common security problems of Central Europe.^*’ T he mem ory of Hungarian rule in Moravia has been kept alive until our days by numerous village-names, built upon the Hungarian vocable, such as Uhersky and Uhr-Sitz (7 such names), or with other Hungarian words, such as Sallash (= Szallas), the H ungarian for ‘summer dwelling’. Similarly, many Hungarian village-names sur vived in the Ostmark, out of which 25 include the word ‘H ungarian’, such as Ungar-Bach, UngarStein, Ungar-Berg, M arca Hungarica; 103 others are compounded wirh Warte-, Schutze and 196 are built upon Ode, meaning uninhabited land, all of them being situated within the former defense line, as explained by Sandor Torok (P 129 p. 22f).
The relations between Hungary and the Holy See of Rome were always cordial, as soon as the Hungarians had put their heads under the baptis mal water, thereby irrevocably becoming loyal members of the new European community. Pope Sylvestre H together with the German emperor Otto HI, recognized Hungary as a sovereign State. As a token, he sent a golden royal crown to the
61. Originally, the eastern border lands of Germany (the future Austria) were a creation of Frankish rulers. They were re-established later, as duchies of Carinthia (976), Carniola (1040), Styria (1055) and Ostmark (1156).



ruler, who was solemnly proclamed ‘King of H un gary” on Christm as Day of the year 1001. The Pope’s gesture was repeated later by the emperor of Byzantium, who also recognized the sovereign status of Hungary. The two crowns were welded together hito one and symbolized the great powers’ alliance with Hungary. The Holy See of Rome also entrusted the kings of Hungary with the mission to defend, spread and propagate Christianity in the neighbouring pagan countries, especially in the Balkan Peninsula, which was full of schismatics at th at time. This resulted in H ungary’s expansion toward the Adriatic Sea by including Croatia (1097), Dalm atia (1105) and Bosnia (1210). Thus, a t the end o f the X lth century and the beginning of the X llth , not only was Hungary's sovereign status universally recognized, but the country had become a powerful kingdom, ranking third in importance, right after the Holy Roman and the Byzantine Empires. So, after a successful start, Christian Hungary was heading toward the finest hour of its history. Thus, the period of Ancient History of the H un garians came to a close.



5. Epilogue: The fate of the lost Hungarian tribes
After the bulk of Hungarian-speaking peoples -Scythians, Huns, Avars and Magyars- moved out of Eastern Europe and settled in Hungary, this race ceased to play a significant political role in the oriental part of the continent. Ethnographically, however, it continued to be present, since numerous large factions, which were separated from the main body, stayed behind. The reason for such detachm ents were varied. First it was the general custom th at migrating steppe peoples must leave an adequate number of warriors and woman folk behind to stand guard over the ancient land, upon which they could fall back, should the search for new and better grazing land fail. Then, internal political tensions may also have caused secessions. Furthermore, and most frequently, they were ex posed to enemy attacks which could cut oflF thou sands of people and sweep them away from the main block. Larger Hungarian break-away tribes stayed behind in the following areas: 1. in Cauca sia, 2. in the Volga region, 3. in Touran and 4. in Moldavia. 1. In Caucasia, the detached Hungarian tribes were those living between the Kuma and Terek rivers, on the northwestern side of the Caspian Sea, called Kum-Magaria. Bear witness of their



tribulations eight papal edicts (Bulls) granted between 1245 and 1291. T heir texts have been published by Laszlo Bendefy (P 010). Among the other contemporary documents relating to the problem we can mention an inscription carved on stone, found in the Crimean Peninsula and deci phered by the author. Finally, tradition also de serves to be mentioned, preserved by both the Danubian Hungarians and the successors of Hun garians in the East. Amongst the most im portant historical studies devoted to this question are the works of L. Bendefy (P Oil) and Janos Boros (P 018). B ut in spite of this apparent richness of documentation on this topic, many questions re main unanswered, so th a t our account is still conjectural on several points. The Caucasian Hungarians were characterized by the fact th at they lacked comprehensive pohtical organization for a long time, having lived in chaotic conditions, each of their clans and tribes by themselves, in as many mini-states. With the emergence of the Mongol threat, however, the feeling prevailed amongst them, th at for their m utual defense and survival, they m ust unite their forces. Accordingly, they all placed themselves under the authority of King Yeretany. This king wanted, above anything else, to give his kingdom a Christian organization. Therefore, he turned for help to the Holy See, asking for catholic priests. These antecedents led to the emission of a first



papal edict by John XXII, on behalf of the “most eminent Prince Yeretany.” We read the following passage in the said edict: “Greetings to our son Yeretany and other Chris tian Hungarians (in Caucasia)... We have under stood th at thou, my son Yeretany, who art a descendant from the earliest Catholic kings of Hungary, wanted to receive, together with other Christians of the said region... a Catholic mission ary (doctorem Catholicum desiratis habere)." The first “Catholic Doctor” arrived at Magyar-on-theKum a in the person of Bishop Thaddeus (13311334). He was followed by seven others, the last one holding office from 1366 to 1377. It is not known what became thereafter of Yeretany, but his epitaph, found in the Crimea suggests, th at he was himself a priest and fled westwards, before the Mongol invasion. His inscription actually reads thus: “Here is kept, by the Armenian monks, the holy treasure of Yeretany, an Iranian lord and prince of the Don-bank. (This treasure) consists of two church-cans. Great holiness was the dis tinctive m ark of this ‘living God’.” The drea ded onslaught of the Mongol armies material ized in 1395/96, when the city of M agyar was destroyed and the Kuma-Terek plain incorporated into the Kiptchak-Turk empire as a province. The few surviving Magyars then retreated into the mountains and F. Nansen, the Norvegian explorer, was the last European who spoke to their descend ants in 1925.



2. The second and by far the largest H ungarian speaking ethnic group, th at of the Volga H ungari ans was detached from the main body somewhere to the north of the Caspian sea in the V lth century following the attacks of the Turks, and was pushed northwards along the river Volga. They were met be the imperial ambassador Zemarchus, who talked with the “Prince of the Hungarians, who reigned by the grace of Dizabuli khan” (Ongororum dux qui illic ex auctoritate Dizabuli imperium habehat" (P 092 p. 93 f.). They were then lost from sight and had no contact with any other Hungarian group for about 600 years. They were rediscovered quasi accidentally in 1236 by zealous Dominicans (Black Friars), who originally wanted to find the Caucasian Hungarians, for they wanted to convert them to the Christian faith. Four missionaries started on this venture in 1235, via Constantinople. However, when they arrived a t the city of Matrica (the present Taman), at the entrance of the Maeotis (now Sea of Azov), they altered their itinerary for an unknown reason and instead of continuing eastwards, they turned directly to the north, journeying along the west bank of the Volga. Finally, Friar Julian, the only surviving priest, succeeded in finding a large H un garian tribal group “near the Great River Ethyl.” There is a report on this unique journey, written in the X H Ith century and submitted to the Holy See of Rome, where it is kept in the Record Office. Its text is published in the collection of medieval



writings edited by Imre Szentpetery and is cur rently known as the “Richardus-report” (P 120 II pp. 535-542). This report describes the dram atic encounter thus: “He (Friar Julian) found them near the great river E thyl ( = Volga). When they learned th at he was a Christian Hungarian, they were greatly pleased about his coming. He was shown their houses and cottages and was pressed with questions about the king and the realm of Christian Hungarians. To everything he told them, about faith and other things, they listened attenti vely, because their language was entirely Hungari an and they understood him and he them (quia omnino habent Hungaricum idioma et intelligebant eum et ipse eos).” Julianus then promptly returned to Hungary to impart his im portant discovery to his brethren at home. In the next year (1237), Julianus undertook a second journey to the Volga, but was unable to reach the Ungarian settlem ent because the Mongolian armies were already on the way to make new conquests. In that very year, Hungary at the Volga had been destroyed, a n d the nation’s ethnic identity abo lished for ever. The surviving individual Magyars were scattered all around within a radius of about 200km, on the Volga Heights, around the Pensa and Sura rivers, with some settlem ents at Saratov, Tambov and Riazan. Today, their memory is kept alive by a great number of place-names which include the Magyar name. The local inhabitants remember th a t they have Hungarian blood in their



veins, but do not speak Hungarian any more; Turkish and/or Russian being their language (P 019 p. 229 f.).
3. The Touranian H ungarians always lived somewhat apart from the other Near Eastern Hungarians, to the east of the Caspian Sea, around the Aral Sea and in the Oxus valley. In Hungarian chronicles, this is the region which probably ap pears under the name of Magoria. This ethnic group first attracted the attention of our historians in the last century, when Krist6f Lukacsy devoted a fine work (P 092) to them in 1870. More recently, after World War II, the same area came once again into the forefront of research, thanks to the insis tence of Erik Molnar, whose example was followed by Tibor Toth, P.-T. Veres and Pal Liptak, who all underscored the close connections of the Uralian Hungarians with the Touranians. B ut it is Antal Bartha who deserves the credit for having discovered the earliest role of the Touranians, who were responsible for the civilization of the local population of the Ural region and th at of Western Siberia, in the Ilnd millenium B. C. The surviving traces of the lost Touranian Hungarians were also carefully recorded {Kath. Magyarok Vasdrnapja, January 12,1969; K anadai M agyarsdg, November 23, 1968; Sorsunk, Sidney, February 13, 1960, etc.) and the villages, with ‘M adiar’ names, noted. A major faction of Touranian Hungarians seem to have been swept far away, towards southeastern Asia, into what is today New-Zealand, where they



continue to call themselves Maori (<M a-Ur-i), i.e. Magyar. Their existence has been discovered by F. A. Uxbond (alias Wilhelm von Hevesy) in his sensational book, published in English in 1928 (P 130). This publication lists innum erable evi dence to prove th a t the Maori are closely related to the European Hungarians, both racially and culturally. The Maori of to-day are highly civilized, but almost entirely absorbed into their Englishspeaking surroundings. The mystery of the origin of this ethnic faction has not yet been fully eluci dated, which is perhaps connected with the expan sion of the Kushan Empire. 4. Our record would not be complete without mentioning the break-away Hungarian group of Tchangos, now living in Moldavia, on the other side of the Carpathians, near the rivers Tatros and Sereth, numbering altogether 170,000 souls. The capital city of Moldavia is Yassy, the Hungarian Jdsz-V dros ‘City of the Yazigues’. Their full story is related in a recently published 1520-pages m on um ental sociographic study, by Pdl-Peter Domokos (P 043). The colony started at the beginning of the Christian era, with a faction of Yazigues that did not continue its journey into Hungary for reasons unknown to us, but stayed behind, breaking all relations with their brethren who had entered Hungary and settled there. The Yazigue colony of Moldavia later received additional H un garians, when the warlike Cuman-Turks set up a principality in Moldavia, then Cumania. To



protect Hungary against the harassments of this pagan people, King Andras II (1205-1235) placed border-guards on both sides of the Carpathians, at several points. As a further step toward their pacification, the archbishop of Esztergom/Hungary, established missionaries in Cumania, who converted the people to Christianity. The first bishop had been installed at Milko in 1227 and was followed by a new influx of Magyars. Until 1410, five H ungarian bishoprics were erected. An official census, carried out in the middle of the X V th century, found a total population of 47,167 in Moldavia. Out of th a t number, over 20,000 were Catholic Hungarians. On the eve of World War II, the Tchango-M agyars boasted 60 villages in the T atros valley and 160 along the Sereth river. When the northern corner of Moldavia, the district called Bukovina, was annexed by the Aus tro-Hungarian Monarchy, general A ndris Hadik transferred some Moldavian Hungarians into that district. Their descendants, numbering 24,000 souls, were rapatriated into mother-land Hungary, during the second World War. All the other Tchango-Magyars continue to stay in the land, and are deprived of all cultural facilities in their own language, not even having elementary in struction, despite the fact that they are the native people of the land, who settled there well before the arrival of the first Rum anians in the X lllth century.



To sum up the sad history of the lost Hungarian tribes, we may say th a t ethnographic factions, large or small, which broke away in Eastern Europe from the main body of Hungarians, were able to retain their identity for several centuries but most of them disappeared in the great politi co-military upheaval which was brought about by the Mongol invasion in the X lllth century.
