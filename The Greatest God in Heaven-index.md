THE GREATEST GOD
Of course our ancestors have noticed that the stars are revolving. That is, except from the point in the heaven where no movement seems to take place. The seemingly rotating figure on the northern hemisphere symbolizes the Greatest male deity in the Mythological Story from all over the World. This figure symbolizes for instants Chronos, Zeus, Odin, Saturn (not the planet) and several other names.
On of the most important holy figure for our ancestors was that of the white Milky Way, especially when symbolized as the great white God or spirit in the sky. Ancestors all over the World have had their story of creation connected to this white God-figure in the sky.
But the figure are also symbolized with several other phenomenon's, of which the Heavenly Ship and a White Horse or Bull are the most common.
"ODIN HANGING IN THE TREE"
Why is it that such a mythical telling can occur in the first hand? From which mytho-cosmological observation can this telling derive?
If the World Tree resembles the Earth celestial axis, (and the Earth magnetic field as well) one must conclude that some kind of celestial imagery depicts such a story.
The Norse Worlds have Midgaard as the home of the humans, the Earth and Asgaard belongs to the celestial day- and nighttime realms with the Sun at day and Moon; the wandering stars = planets; stars and star constellations at nighttime. Lastly the Norse Udgaard belongs to the Giants and first creators in the Norse story of creation, which specifically is connected to the Milky Way whitish contours.
On the northern hemisphere a great male-like Milky Way figure (Odin) can be observed at night on a favorable season. This figure seemingly revolves around the Earth celestial pole = the World Tree, and it is said in the myth that "Odin is hanging in the Tree" for "nine days and nights".
When interpreting such a myth, it is of course very important to recognize which mythical figure/archetype belongs to which cosmological observation and when not having discovered the connection, all kind of false interpretations and distorted explanations can occur.
"Odin hanging on a tree" shall be "Odin hanging besides the tree" which resembles the Earth celestial pole. And "Odin hanging for nine days and nights" should be "being observed besides and connected to the Tree in about 9 month of the year" simply because this Milky Way figure cannot be observed in the lightest season of the year, a mytho-cosmological fact which also is described with the myth of "the deity in the Sky who disappears and the promise of his return".
OK, there he is: Odin hanging in the northern hemisphere night Sky, seemingly revolving around the celestial pole, thus being omnipresent and omnipotent and overlooking the whole Midgaard and the humans below. A male figure all made in the human imagination and still a part of the creation of humans because we all are made in the imageries of the deities above and below.



The most simple marking of the northern Milky Way figure and the celestial north pole with the White Milky Way God seemingly revolving around the pole center.

Right side of the cross = Diving into the Underworld. Under the cross = Laying dead. Left side of the cross = Rising. And above the cross = Ascention. This celestial motion and mytheme is even mirrored in the telling of Jesus. See more images here

The Set God: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mythology)#The_Set_animal)
In art, Set was mostly depicted as a mysterious and unknown creature, referred to by Egyptologists as the Set animal or Typhonic beast, with a curved snout, square ears, forked tail, and canine body, or sometimes as a human with only the head of the Set animal. It has no complete resemblance to any known creature, although it does resemble a composite of an aardvark, a donkey, and a jackal, all of which are desert creatures. The main species of aardvark present in ancient Egypt additionally had a reddish appearance (due to thin fur, which shows the skin beneath it). In some descriptions he has the head of a greyhound. The earliest known representation of Set comes from a tomb dating to the Naqada phase of the Predynastic Period (circa 4000 BC–3500 BC), and the Set-animal is even found on a mace-head of the Scorpion King, a Protodynastic ruler.

Was ("power") sceptres represent the Set-animal. Was-sceptres were carried by gods, pharaohs, and priests, as a symbol of power, and in later use, control over the force of chaos (Set). The head and forked tail of the Set-animal are clearly present. Was-sceptres are often depicted in paintings, drawings, and carvings of gods, and remnants of real Was-sceptres have been found constructed of faience or wood.

Pictures 1 and 2 shows male figures in different positions around a ring or centre point compared to the star map picture of the Milky Way contour in the middle. Picture 4 is also showing male figures vaulting. The bird- and men like figures on picture 5 are a clear indication for something going on in the sky, which is a god way of explaining the flying Milky Way male figure in the night sky.

In the other horizontal position he might observe and carve a so called ship. Mythological the figure therefore become a mixed story with a great God who can change between human and animal shapes an as a God sailing away on his ship.
When first one have discovered our ancestors way of symbolizing and mythologizing the Milky Way figure, it is easy to understand the old stories from almost every indigenous people all over the world. Then you also are able to understand the remarkable symbol- and mythological resemblance all over the World. Simply because all people have noticed the same colossal figure in the night sky.

Descent to the underworld
The theme of mythical deities and Heroes "descending to The Underworld" is of course very global since it deals with the the Southern Earth Hemisphere - and NOT with something down under the soil - and especially with the southern Milky Way contours and the Great Mother Goddess and the archetype of the Milky Way center.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_to_the_underworld
Harrowing of Hell, an icon by Dionisius, from the Ferapontov Monastery.
The descent to the underworld is a mytheme of comparative mythology found in the religions of the Ancient Near East up to and including Christianity. The myth involves the death of a youthful god (or goddess: Persephone, Inanna, for instance) who is a life-death-rebirth deity, mourned and then recovered from the underworld by his or her consort, lover or mother.

1 Katabasis 2 Mythological characters
Katabasis
Main article: katabasis
One meaning of katabasis is the epic convention of the hero's trip into the underworld.[1] In Greek mythology, for example, Orpheus enters the underworld in order to bring Eurydice back to the world of the living.
Most katabases take place in a supernatural underworld, such as Hades or Hell — as in Nekyia, the 11th book of the Odyssey, which describes the descent of Odysseus to the underworld. However, katabasis can also refer to a journey through other dystopic areas, like those Odysseus encounters on his 20-year journey back from Troy to Ithaca. Pilar Serrano[1] allows the term katabasis to encompass brief or chronic stays in the underworld, including those of Lazarus and Castor and Pollux.
