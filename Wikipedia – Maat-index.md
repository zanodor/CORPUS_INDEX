For other uses, see Maat (disambiguation).
Maat or Ma'at (Egyptian mt /ˈmuʀʕat/)[1] refers to the ancient Egyptian concepts of
truth, balance, order, harmony, law, morality, and justice. Maat was also the goddess
who personified these concepts, and regulated the stars, seasons, and the actions of
mortals and the deities who had brought order from chaos at the moment of creation.
Her ideological opposite was Isfet (Egyptian jzft), meaning injustice, chaos, violence or
to do evil.
Not to be confused with Mut.
Cuneiform texts indicate that the word m3ʕt was pronounced /múʔʕa/ during the New
Kingdom of Egypt, having lost the feminine ending t.[2] Sound shifts from u to e later
produced the cognate Coptic word ⲙⲉⲉ/ⲙⲉ "truth, justice".[3]
The earliest surviving records indicating that Maat is the norm for nature and society, in
this world and the next, were recorded during the Old Kingdom of Egypt, the earliest
substantial surviving examples being found in the Pyramid Texts of Unas (ca. 2375
BCE and 2345 BCE).[4]
Later, when most goddesses were paired with a male aspect, her masculine
counterpart was Thoth, as their attributes are similar. In other accounts, Thoth was
paired off with Seshat, goddess of writing and measure, who is a lesser-known deity.
After her role in creation and continuously preventing the universe from returning to
chaos, her primary role in ancient Egyptian religion dealt with the Weighing of the Heart
that took place in the Duat.[5] Her feather was the measure that determined whether
the souls (considered to reside in the heart) of the departed would reach the paradise
of the afterlife successfully.
Pharaohs are often depicted with the emblems of Maat to emphasise their role in
upholding the laws and righteousness.[6]

As a principle



Winged Maat
Maat represents the ethical and moral principle that every Egyptian citizen was
expected to follow throughout their daily lives. They were expected to act with honor
and truth in manners that involve family, the community, the nation, the environment,
and the gods.[7]
Maat as a principle was formed to meet the complex needs of the emergent Egyptian
state that embraced diverse peoples with conflicting interests.[8] The development of
such rules sought to avert chaos and it became the basis of Egyptian law. From an
early period the King would describe himself as the "Lord of Maat" who decreed with
his mouth the Maat he conceived in his heart.
The significance of Maat developed to the point that it embraced all aspects of
existence, including the basic equilibrium of the universe, the relationship between
constituent parts, the cycle of the seasons, heavenly movements, religious
observations and fair dealings, honesty and truthfulness in social interactions.[8]
The ancient Egyptians had a deep conviction of an underlying holiness and unity within
the universe. Cosmic harmony was achieved by correct public and ritual life. Any
disturbance in cosmic harmony could have consequences for the individual as well as
the state. An impious King could bring about famine, and blasphemy could bring



blindness to an individual.[9] In opposition to the right order expressed in the concept
of Maat is the concept of Isfet: chaos, lies and violence.[10]
In addition to the importance of the Maat, several other principles within ancient
Egyptian law were essential, including an adherence to tradition as opposed to
change, the importance of rhetorical skill, and the significance of achieving impartiality
and "righteous action". In one Middle Kingdom (2062 to c. 1664 BCE) text the Creator
declares "I made every man like his fellow". Maat called the rich to help the less
fortunate rather than exploit them, echoed in tomb declarations: "I have given bread to
the hungry and clothed the naked" and "I was a husband to the widow and father to
the orphan".[11]
To the Egyptian mind, Maat bound all things together in an indestructible unity: the
universe, the natural world, the state, and the individual were all seen as parts of the
wider order generated by Maat.
A passage in the Instruction of Ptahhotep presents Ma'at as follows:
Ma'at is good and its worth is lasting.
It has not been disturbed since the day of its creator,
whereas he who transgresses its ordinances is punished.
It lies as a path in front even of him who knows nothing.
Wrongdoing has never yet brought its venture to port.
It is true that evil may gain wealth but the strength of truth is that it lasts;
a man can say: "It was the property of my father."[12]
The law



Maat wearing feather of truth
There is little surviving literature that describes the practice of ancient Egyptian law.
Maat was the spirit in which justice was applied rather than the detailed legalistic
exposition of rules. Maat represented the normal and basic values that formed the
backdrop for the application of justice that had to be carried out in the spirit of truth
and fairness. From the Fifth Dynasty (c. 2510–2370 BCE) onwards, the vizier
responsible for justice was called the Priest of Maat and in later periods judges wore
images of Maat.[13]
Later scholars and philosophers also would embody concepts from the Sebayt, a
native wisdom literature. These spiritual texts dealt with common social or professional
situations and how each was best to be resolved or addressed in the spirit of Maat. It
was very practical advice, and highly case-based, so few specific and general rules
could be derived from them.[14]
During the Greek period in Egyptian history, Greek law existed alongside Egyptian law.
The Egyptian law preserved the rights of women who were allowed to act
independently of men and own substantial personal property and in time this
influenced the more restrictive conventions of the Greeks and Romans.[15] When the
Romans took control of Egypt, the Roman legal system which existed throughout the
Roman Empire was imposed in Egypt.



Scribes
Scribes held prestigious positions in ancient Egyptian society in view of their
importance in the transmission of religious, political and commercial information.[16]
Thoth was the patron of scribes who is described as the one "who reveals Maat and
reckons Maat; who loves Maat and gives Maat to the doer of Maat".[17] In texts such as
the Instruction of Amenemope the scribe is urged to follow the precepts of Maat in his
private life as well as his work.[18] The exhortations to live according to Maat are such
that these kinds of instructional texts have been described as "Maat Literature".[19]

Goddess Maat[20][21]
in hieroglyphs
Maat was the goddess of harmony, justice, and truth represented as a young
woman,[22] sitting or standing, holding a was scepter, the symbol of power, in one hand
and an ankh, the symbol of eternal life, in the other. Sometimes she is depicted with
wings on each arm or as a woman with an ostrich feather on her head.[21] The meaning
of this emblem is uncertain, although the god Shu, who in some myths is Maat's
brother, also wears it.[23] Depictions of Maat as a goddess are recorded from as early
as the middle of the Old Kingdom (c. 2680 to 2190 BCE).[24]
The sun-god Ra came from the primaeval mound of creation only after he set his



daughter Maat in place of Isfet (chaos). Kings inherited the duty to ensure Maat
remained in place and they with Ra are said to "live on Maat", with Akhenaten (r. 1372
1355 BCE) in particular emphasising the concept to a degree that, John D. Ray
asserts, the kings contemporaries viewed as intolerance and fanaticism.[25] Some
kings incorporated Maat into their names, being referred to as Lords of Maat,[26] or
Meri-Maat (Beloved of Maat).
Maat had an invaluable role in the ceremony of the Weighing of the Heart. (See below:
"The Weighing of the Heart").
Temples
The earliest evidence for a dedicated temple is in the New Kingdom (c. 1569 to 1081
BCE) era, despite the great importance placed on Maat. Amenhotep III commissioned
a temple in the Karnak complex, whilst textual evidence indicates that other temples of
Maat were located in Memphis and at Deir el-Medina.[27] The Maat temple at the
Karnak complex was also used by courts to meet regarding the robberies of the royal
tombs during the rule of Ramesses IX.[23]

The Weighing of the Heart
In the Duat, the Egyptian underworld, the hearts of the dead were said to be weighed
against her single "Feather of Ma'at", symbolically representing the concept of Maat, in
the Hall of Two Truths. This is why hearts were left in Egyptian mummies while their
other organs were removed, as the heart (called "ib") was seen as part of the Egyptian
soul. If the heart was found to be lighter or equal in weight to the feather of Maat, the
deceased had led a virtuous life and would go on to Aaru. Osiris came to be seen as
the guardian of the gates of Aaru after he became part of the Egyptian pantheon and
displaced Anubis in the Ogdoad tradition. A heart which was unworthy was devoured
by the goddess Ammit and its owner condemned to remain in the Duat.[28]
The weighing of the heart, pictured on papyrus in the Book of the Dead typically, or in
The afterlife



tomb scenes, shows Anubis overseeing the weighing and Ammit seated awaiting the
results so she could consume those who failed. The image would be the vertical heart
on one flat surface of the balance scale and the vertical Shu-feather standing on the
other balance scale surface. Other traditions hold that Anubis brought the soul before
the posthumous Osiris who performed the weighing. While the heart was weighed the
deceased recited the 42 Negative Confessions as the Assessors of Maat looked on.[28]
In funerary texts
Weighing of the Heart Book of the Dead written on papyrus showing the Weighing of the Heart in the Duat using the feather of Maat as the measure in balance
Egyptians were often entombed with funerary texts in order to be well equipped for the
afterlife as mandated by ancient Egyptian funerary practices. These often served to
guide the deceased through the afterlife, and the most famous one is the Book of the
Dead or Papyrus of Ani (known to the ancient Egyptians as The Book of Coming Forth
by Day). The lines of these texts are often collectively called the "Forty-Two
Declarations of Purity".[29] These declarations varied somewhat from tomb to tomb as
they were tailored to the individual, and so cannot be considered a canonical definition
of Maat. Rather, they appear to express each tomb owner's individual practices in life
to please Maat, as well as words of absolution from misdeeds or mistakes, made by
the tomb owner in life could be declared as not having been done, and through the
power of the written word, wipe particular misdeed from the afterlife record of the
deceased. Many of the lines are similar, however, and paint a very unified picture of
Maat.[29]
The doctrine of Maat is represented in the declarations to Rekhti-merti-f-ent-Maat and
the 42 Negative Confessions listed in the Papyrus of Ani. The following are translations
by E. A. Wallis Budge.[29]

Maat during the years of their lives;" i.e., they are the righteous minor deities who
deserve offerings.[29] As the deceased follows the set formula of Negative Confessions,
he addresses each god directly and mentions the nome of which the god is a patron,
in order to emphasize the unity of the nomes of Egypt.[32]
