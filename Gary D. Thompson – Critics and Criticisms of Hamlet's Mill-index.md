Critics and Criticisms of Hamlet's Mill
"A myth is like a mercenary, it can be made to fight for anyone." - Wendy Doniger
"I have seldom known anyone who deserted truth in trifles that could be trusted in matters of importance." - William Paley [The toleration of trivial untruths may lead to more substantial untruths being perpetuated. Being exacting/stringent is not a useless exercise.]
Part 1: The Book and the Authors: Context and Critique
On left, 1999 Italian-language edition of Hamlet's Mill , which was translated/edited by Alessandro Passi and comprised a new and expanded edition (630 pages). On right, previously the 1993 German-language edition of Hamlet's Mill, translated by Beate Ziegs and edited by Rolf Herken, comprised the definitive edition of the book. Both books are similar in content.
The authors of Hamlet's Mill: Giorgio de Santillana (30.5.1902-8.6.1974) and Hertha von Dechend (5.10.1915-23.4.2001) at MIT circa 1967/1968 - photographed in de Santillana's office.

Note: Some allowances need to be made for the progressive nature - and sometimes repetitive nature - of the content of this essay. I presently have little time to re-edit the progressive content. Also, due to the accumulation of information in 2013, parts of this essay need to be rewritten/brought up to date, when time allows.
Intention of essay
The aim of this essay is to provide critical guidance and comprehensive details to understanding the themes presented in Hamlet's Mill (and, necessarily, von Dechend's MIT seminar notes on which the book is selectively based). It is not likely that anyone will attempt the task again soon. Hamlet’s Mill comprises a peculiar episode in the history of 20th-century scholarship. It sets out a hyperdiffusionist theory of encoded astronomical knowledge in antiquity. Its claims now only survive in popular culture as part of pseudohistory claims espoused by non-academic alternative historians. I have spent literally thousands of hours researching over 30 years. Information I don't have may simply no longer exist. The best critique of an idea lies in understanding its origins and history. The intent of anyone attempting to be a historian needs to be to hunt for facts in the attempt to close gaps in knowledge and limit the assumptions about a subject. I believe this to be important. Also, where possible, we need to understand the motives of people. This involves mustering facts (without bias) about people. This essay traces the development of Hamlet's Mill, inclusive of considerable details about the authors. I first obtained a copy of Hamlet's Mill in Boston whilst travelling through the USA in the late 1970s but was only able to give it attention circa 2000. (I still have that copy of the paperback edition even though it is now falling apart.) Also, it was only then I began acquiring a range of material to enable a detailed analysis of it. In mid September (15 September) 2006 - to clarify some issues - I telephoned and spoke with Jerry and Maggie Lettvin. In circa 2005 - at considerable personal expense (though reasonable for the circumstances) - I obtained from an American bookseller in Paris photocopies of the 1961, 1966, and 1979 MIT seminar notes compiled by von Dechend. Unfortunately the 1961 set of notes were slightly incomplete. (The 1961 and 1979 set of notes are indicated as complete.) Circa 2014 I obtained - courtesy of Abe Aronow - his original copies of the 1961 (incomplete) and 1966 (complete) MIT seminar notes compiled by von Dechend. It became obvious that understanding the book Hamlet's Mill (1969, and also later editions) properly involves understanding the more expansive versions of the participant notes compiled by von Dechend for the MIT seminars. This is because it is readily identifiable that the book Hamlet's Mill is compiled/assembled from selected parts of the differing versions of the MIT notes prepared for the seminars. The book Hamlet's Mill is not a revision of the MIT seminar notes on which it is based. It is obvious that nearly all - if not all - supporters of Hamlet's Mill have never seen any of the versions of the notes for the MIT seminars. This is a distinct disadvantage. To read the various versions of the notes for the MIT seminars reinforces and expands criticisms of the book. Hamlet's Mill is described in the original publisher's blurb "This is a truly seminal and original thesis ...." It is neither.
Note: If both authors are going to be promoted as experts for dealing with, and understanding, obscure mythological stories then we need to look at their credentials and their methodology. For a number of reasons any accusation of ad hominem is misplaced. (The concept of ad hominem argument is interesting, as well as misunderstood.) The greater part of the essay deals with the critical analysis of their claims. It is not difficult to show the authors have mishandled philology, astronomy, archaeology, and history and have reached clearly false conclusions. I have attempted to avoid rancour but I have not attempted to avoid critical comments/assessments.
Introduction to Hamlet's Mill
Hamlet's Mill is an ambitious book. Giorgio de Santillana was well-known but not famous - as one person maintains - for Hamlet’s Mill. Hamlet's Mill is a very curious book of mythological speculation - a hypothetical work of highly speculative scholarship. It is thought provoking but not convincing. Hamlet's ill s more polemical and dogmatic than historically convincing. (It is deemed exploratory by its authors. Their case rests on their particular interpretation of myths. (Myths are typically defined by scholars as traditional views, fables, legends or stories.) They believed they had broken part of an archaic code embedded in ancient mythology. Apparently the numerous polemical assertions are intended as hypotheses, provocations to others to conduct their own research.) There is no reason to presume the reliability of the conjectured detail in Hamlet's Mill. In fact, there is every reason to reject such. Hamlet's Mill has been described as: "An eclectic mess of fiction and nonfiction ...." (Chaotic in both structure and explanation. The authors defend the chaotic presentation of their argument because of what they term is the 'non-caternary' nature of the archaic structure of the ideas they seek to explain! Discussion of this alleged discovery has been overlooked. In Hamlet's Mill, Giorgio de Santillana and Herta von Dechend suggested that prehistoric humans may have thought and expressed themselves in "fugue," while modern humans; express themselves at least, in a "catenary" form. The lack of organization throughout the book is justified by the authors on the grounds that the archaic way of thought being discussed was not itself an organized system. (I would conclude that in reality de Santillana's task of trying to shape a usable manuscript from existing material proved too much for him. Also, he had not kept touch with von Dechend's material comprising



the student notes.) Regardless, it would have been highly useful for the authors to present such claimed unsystematic material in a systematic manner.) One enthusiast has stated it is "one of the most influential books on mythology ever written." It is, of course no such thing. There is no truth to some enthusiastic claims that since the publication of Hamlet's Mill it has been recognised that ancient myths encode a large and complex body of astronomical information. There is a complete lack of organization to the book. The authors fail to present a clear integrated case. The book begins with discussions of medieval legends (starting with Hamlet) without any explanation of why this is being done. The first introduction of an astronomical discussion is placed in an "Intermezzo" (no chapter number) after Chapter 4. The first clear introduction of the astronomical thesis comprising the book is placed nearly halfway through the book. The authors seek to justify this on the grounds that the archaic way of thought being discussed was not itself an organized system. However, this simply ignores the duty of good authors to clearly present unsystematic material in a systematic way. The central premise is somewhat odd. Through adoption of a 'cherry-picking' approach the authors of Hamlet's Mill claim to present the key to decoding early man's mythological imagination - ancient myths can be interpreted as a code language expressing the astronomical knowledge of precession of the equinoxes among early cultures. More specifically, (1) world mythologies are based on celestial (planetary) events, and (2) precession forms the setting for astronomical mythologies. Though somewhat vague, the authors propose that initial knowledge of precession originated circa 5000 BCE during a 'Golden Age' in the Neolithic Near East, with the commencement of a major calendrical system. Both the authors are ultra-diffusionists. Nothing in the book provides conclusive evidence for its claims. However that does not prevent the misguided claim: "De Santillana and von Dechend have made a special study of ancient knowledge regarding the Precession of the Equinoxes. (The Shape of Ancient Thought by Thomas McEvilley (2002, Page 80.)" It has been stated that Hamlet's Mill is a multidisciplinary book. The issue is its form of dated arguments lie very much in the realm of 19th-century scholarship. Also, the book is lengthy, dense, and poorly constructed. Simply, it lacks a cogent argument. Only through speculation do the authors get from A to B. The knowledge of astronomy and philology exhibited by both the authors is inadequate for the task. It has been called a 'notorious New Age classic.' At one time it was used at the University of Melbourne as a text book for history of science studies. Its content proved impenetrable to students. Aharon Varady (Community Planner (M.C.P.) and Jewish Educator (M.A.J.Ed.)) writes at his website: "As an undergraduate [at the University of Cincinnati, 2002-2004], I studied what Georgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend called in their introduction to Hamlet's Mill (1968 (sic)): "Comparative Cosmography," an anthropological and historical study of mental maps and cosmologies." So, at the turn of the 21st-century Hamlet’s Mill was still being used as a university textbook. Varady makes no comment regarding understanding Hamlet's Mill. However, theories about astral myths continue to captivate people. This essay is a dispassionate examination - and critical review - of the authors and their book. The authors of the book have attained a somewhat mythical status as cutting edge (progressive) academics. However, it is not a breakthrough book.
Hamlet's Mill is now simply a cultist book i.e., supported by a particular kind of people. Some people find the astronomical mythology claims of Hamlet's Mill an attractive and intriguing idea. The shortcomings of Hamlet's Mill are easily identified but ignored by devotees. Hamlet's Mill enthusiasts show no deep understanding of the important astronomical and philological issues. For devotees of the book, Hamlet's Mill finalises the explanation of mythology and folklore. Any further investigation needs to begin with the tenets set out in the book. Hamlet's Mill devotees ignore all the research done since the publication of the book.
Note: The term "cherry picking" is a colloquialism usually used in informal speech but also used in writing. It denotes the act of selectively choosing from available information that which seems to confirm a particular position while ignoring significant information that does or may contradict that position. Because its use has the intent of obtaining an advantage in establishing a case by presenting an argument in the best possible light, and in doing so subverting the normal goal of accurate assessment, cherry picking always has a negative connotation. It is biased evidence ("evidence" hunting). There is no attempt to work critically with the best available body of (historical) evidence. The intention is to only seek "affirming" evidence. It manipulates the reader/listener through presentation of selective evidence, to convince them to accept the same view. Another technique/strategy is "framing;" the attempt at influencing by the way information is presented.
Persons still see Hamlet's Mill as an "immensely learned volume" and an "important book." However, some 45 years on nobody has produced a convincing argument supporting the mythological speculation in Hamlet's Mill. Those people who describe the book as "important" fail to demonstrate exactly why this description is accurate. It is an odd theory and has remained an odd theory over the passage of time. In the words of the archaeologist Rebecca Bradley it is a "bizarre academic curiosity." Hamlet's Mill is undoubtedly one of the most peculiar works of pseudohistory ever to come out of academe. It is a thesis that is ultimately dubious. It has also been described by the archaeologist Rebecca Bradley (28 July 2013) as a "wild gallop through comparative mythology, based on the insistence that everybody except the book's authors (and especially all anthropologists and archaeologists) are interpreting everything from antiquity all wrong." Some 45 years on, Hamlet's Mill supports a "cottage industry" of amateur enthusiasts. It is claimed that only the book's 2 authors (in 1960s North America) have been able to determine the truth. The book is also described by the archaeologist Rebecca Bradley (28 July 2013) as "chaotic, totally disconnected from archaeological evidence, shamelessly speculative, and generally batty."
Hamlet's Mill purports to be a study of the great antiquity of astronomical knowledge. Ancient myths is viewed as a repository of astronomical knowledge. The authors begin by dismissing all opposing points of view! This approach originated in the MIT seminar notes - the earliest of which was jointly authored by de Santillana and von Dechend. The authors think that everyone is wrong but themselves. Enthusiasts for the theme of the book simply accept that hundreds of supposedly prehistoric myths have proved that most ancient peoples around the planet had a far greater knowledge of astronomy than conventional academics are willing to acknowledge. One enthusiast describes it as "a comprehensive book about myths associated with precession." This is, of course, untrue. The Origins of the World's Mythologies by E. J. Michael Witzel (2012/2013), the most recent comprehensive study on the origins of mythology, rejects the idea of "mnemotechnical mechanics of myth formation as storage device of Stone Age 'scientific' knowledge" as the be-all-end-all explanation of myth. It seems unnecessary to invoke Hamlet's Mill as a basis for making astronomical interpretations of early Chinese literature. On a number of occasions an astronomical basis is claimed internally within early period Chinese literature. The use of material from the literary period of China (by David Pankenier and Deborah Porter) as examples for verifying Hamlet's Mill remain late examples of astronomy being placed into myth (by only a few persons), and also culturally limited examples.
Hamlet's Mill is an attempt to salvage Panbabylonism. Astral mythology dominated much of the German Panbabylonism school. Hamlet's Mill, like its predecessor Astralmythen, is dense with arcane analyses that demand dedication from the reader to persevere. The reader has to believe that the premises behind either book have a real validity and are important enough to be worth following to some conclusions. The claim that Babylonian astral myths spread by diffusion throughout the ancient Near East and also to all peoples throughout the world, including rudimentary societies, influencing religions and mythologies, originates with the Panbabylonism of Eduard Stucken. It is also the basic tenet of Hamlet's Mill.
To simply state - as some supporters of the book currently do - that the authors of Hamlet's Mill "did not get everything right" is irrelevant to understanding the slipshod but influential 'heritage of ideas' that comprise the claims made within the book. After a period of some 50 years Hertha von Dechend failed to make any real progress in explaining and clarifying her ideas. Von Dechend believed she was establishing evidence that advanced astronomical information had been gathered before the origin of writing. Von Dechend has clearly demonstrated in a number of ways that she had not been energetic regarding the theme of Hamlet's Mill. She literally published almost nothing!



Hamlet's Mill is no stumbling block to orthodox historians of astronomy. Hamlet's Mill is unreliable. Hamlet's Mill, by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend (1969), though influential with alternative historians, is an imaginative recreation of the Neolithic past that is lacking tangible supportive evidence. Even if precession was known and had some religious or astrological significance it is not known what this significance was or if it was linked to a concept of astrological ages. Also, it is a mythological mess that becomes lost in its own complexity. The book is essentially unreadable. The manuscript for it was not in a publishable form. Oddly, the authors did not establish a structure and methods. The authors are constantly involved in unrelated digressions. At times the authors of Hamlet’s Mill venture into hubris. Much of Hamlet's Mill is badly flawed by its deliberate reliance on out-of-date sources. There is no close engagement with recent theories. The peculiarity of this procedure is defended by the authors. The book is an ill-informed scold of modern scholarship. Its authors intentionally have ignored (indeed berated) up-to-date scholarship because they have not deemed it correct, and have chosen to rely on dubious earlier work dating to the 19th-century. In over 40 years Hamlet's Mill has not transformed how mythology is studied.
Excursus: Another author who believed she could trace ideas back to the Neolithic/Bronze-age period was the independent scholar, medievalist, and folklorist Jesse Weston (1850-1928) who worked mainly on mediaeval Arthurian texts. In her best-known book, From Ritual to Romance (1920), with the aid of specious scholarship (she brought to bear an analysis harking back to James George Frazer), she traces the Arthurian Grail legend back to ancient vegetation/fertility cults and their rituals. Weston's work on the Grail legend has been criticised as fanciful speculation, She has also been dismissed as a theosophist. Her long time supporter Roger Loomis (1887-1966) - an American scholar and one of the foremost authorities on medieval and Arthurian literature- eventually abandoned her hypothesis. Weston was a Wagnerite (a lover of Richard Wagner's classical music and plays/dramas) and her book is focused on Parsifal, the Grail hero whom Richard Wagner had made the central figure of his final musical drama.
As far as I am aware there has been no comprehensive study of Hamlet's Mill and its authors, and an attempt to understand how the book came into existence. This essay can be taken as a contribution. Some recent interest is indicated. From a personal communication in early October 2015 I understand that Marco Sensi at the University of Perugia is a PhD candidate and his thesis topic is connected with Hamlet's Mill. Currently (2018), details for Marco Sensi are Università degli Studi di Perugia (UNIPG), Faculty of Literature and Philosophy. I am not aware of the title of his PhD thesis. Also from a personal communication in late 2017 I understand that Eleonora Loiodice at the University of Bari Aldo Moro is a PhD candidate and her thesis topic is Giorgio de Santillana. Currently (2018), details for Eleonora Loiodice are: Currently works at the Centro Interdipartimentale Seminario di Storia della Scienza, Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro (Università di Bari, Italy). She does does research in Cosmology, Philosophy of Science and Epistemology. Her PhD project is on the figure of Giorgio Diaz De Santillana. I am not aware of the title of her PhD thesis.
Excursus: Myth as Source of Knowledge in Early Western Thought: The Quest for Historiography, Science and Philosophy in Greek Antiquity by Harald Haarmann (2015). This book share some similarities with Hamlet's Mill (but there are no precessional/astronomical arguments). Harald Haarmann, Ph.D. (1946- ) is a German linguist and cultural scientist currently (2016) an independent scholar who has been labelled the world's leading expert on ancient scripts and languages. He earned his doctorate in linguistics at Bonn University in 1970 and his Habilitation at Trier University in 1979 with a two-volume study on the linguistics of Balkan languages. He has taught at universities in Germany and Japan, and is currently (2016) doing research in the fields of language and culture studies, archaeomythology, and archaeolinguistics. See the highly critical (English-language) book review by William Wians (Merrimack College) in Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2016.01.14. William Wians is Professor of Philosophy at Merrimack College in North Andover, Massachusetts. The book is criticised for lacking coherence in dealing with Greek myths and associated themes.
The myth of invariance
On the first page (page v and the theme is continued on page vi) of the Preface of Hamlet's Mill Mill (a succinct essay on Pythagoreanism), de Santillana writes: "Over many years I have searched for the point where myth and science join. It was clear to me for a long time that the origins of science had their deep roots roots in a particular myth, that of invariance." On page vi he writes: "I was at this point, lost between science and myth, when, on the occasion of a meeting in Frankfurt in 1959 I met Dr. von Dechend ...." The myth of invariance is introduced/mentioned somewhat indistinctly but the connection of invariance and astronomy are broached in the Pythagorean concept of the Music of the Spheres which involved joining (1) the invariant solar year with (2) the invariant harmonic intervals. For the authors of Hamlet's Mill the precessional year appears to be another example in nature of invariance. However, no link between myth and precessional astronomy and/or zodiacal world ages is shown.
For the purposes of Hamlet's Mill myth is an oral account of divine behaviour and a corpus of heroic figures.

The authors of Hamlet’s Mill as uniformitarians
Hyperdiffusion is a cornerstone of Hamlet's Mill. Also, the authors can be described as staunch uniformitarians. With specific reference to the myth of Phaethon they state (Page 253): "The Pythagoreans were neither idle storytellers, nor were they even mildly interested in unusual sensational "catastrophes" caused by meteors, and the like."
The anthropologist J. H. Rowe (1966, page 334) wrote that diffusionist arguments are defective in principle; 'science fiction', and 'a menace to the development of sound archaeological theory based on comparative studies.' Hyperdiffusionism is an extreme form of unscientific diffusionism which postulates that all cultures are derived from very few antecedents.
Indications of lack of planning of the content of Hamlet's Mill
It is indicated several times that the text was written/assembled sequentially 'on-the-run' without the overall plan and content being fully developed. As example (Hamlet's Mill, Page 123, Comment in Footnote 16): "Whether we shall find the time to deal in the appropriate form with the tripartite Universe in this essay remains doubtful."
According to Jerome Lettvin (telephone conversation, 15/9/2006), de Santillana, because of his fluency with the English-language, helped put [edit] Hamlet's Mill together from von Dechend's notes.
Note: According to von Dechend in her Preface to the 'revised' 1993 German-language edition, de Santillana's involvement in producing a manuscript for publication was actually due to her procrastination in producing a manuscript for publication. Basically, de Santillana put his name as co-author to von Dechend's book. However, he largely functioned as editor (and carried out this activity when he was ill).
Book reviews



The book did not have a favourable reception by academics due to its lack of suitable method and standards of proof. At the time of publication the only favourable book reviews were written by their academic friends at MIT, namely Philip Morrison and Harald Reiche. There seems to have been a "buddy system" in place. However, some of de Santillana's supporters at MIT were extremely talented astronomers/physicists (i.e., Philip Morrison) and classicists (i.e., Harald Reiche). Philip Morrison's professional expertise is basically irrelevant to the content of Hamlet's Mill.
In his supportive book review of Hamlet's Mill (The Classical Journal, Volume 69, Number 1, October-November, 1973, Pages 81-83) Harald Reiche mentions "Martiny's proof that the angular values of the corrections periodically introduced into the axial alignments of many Near Eastern sanctuaries equalled and thus offset those of precessional shift for the same period." It is fair to say that Martiny's ideas remain controversial and are largely viewed as unsupported. Martiny concluded that Mesopotamian temples were oriented with respect to the north celestial pole. The circular path traced by this this point in the sky due to the precession of the equinoxes determined the orientation of Mesopotamian temples and the orientation thus testified to the date. Serious flaws have been identified with Martiny's methods.
The astronomical orientation, but not precessional re-alignment, of Mesopotamian temples was considered by some 19th-century excavators and briefly considered in Stonehenge and Other British Stone Monuments Astronomically Considered by Norman Lockyer (1906, Chapter XXIX A
Short History of Astronomy). The thesis of Martiny is based on figures from Warka that were later seriously questioned. (Babylonian and Assyrian 'temple sites' included in his study were Uruk (Southern Iraq), Tell El-'Obēd (Tell el-'Ubaid) ) (Southern Iraq), Tepe Gawra (Northwest Iraq), and Assur (on the upper Tigris River in Iraq). One of the methodological issues with the figures produced by Martiny is that he charted the orientation of the Gimilsin Temple and the Palace Chapel according to True Magnetic North rather than True North and he made adjustments accordingly. Also, he gave no explanatory information regarding the data on the orientation of the other temples included in his orientation chart. Further, the "orientation chart," whilst showing the eastward movement of the Assur temples and β Andromedae, is somewhat vague. (There is no persuasive evidence that Mesopotamian temples, of any period, were systematically aligned to any directions.) Circa 1986 Asger Aaboe advised that Martiny's claims were purely hypothetical and that still today nothing is known about if and how the ancient Mesopotamians used astronomy to orient their temples. (See: Revue d'assyriologie et d'archéologie oriental, Tomes 80-81, 1986, Page 39.) The topic of temple orientation has never gained popularity in Assyriology. Martiny's ideas on temple orientation are briefly noted by the assyriologist William Hallo in his book Origins: The Ancient Near Eastern Background of Some Modern Western Institutions (1996, Page 84).
Precession
As a simple explanation: The phenomenon of precession is caused by a slow wobble of the Earth's axis that takes approximately 26,000 years to complete a cycle. (The wobble is caused by the Sun and the Moon. Because the Earth’s axis is tilted to its orbital plane the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon on the Earth's equatorial bulge tend to pull it back towards the plane of the ecliptic. Because the Earth is spinning, its axis precesses. Planetary precession means the gravitational pull of the planets that perturbs the Earth's orbit and slowly changes the plane of the ecliptic. General precession means the combination of luni-solar and planetary precessions.) The north celestial pole moves in a precessional circle around the pole of the ecliptic resulting in the equinoxes precessing westward around the ecliptic. Because of general precession, the framework of right ascension and declination (ecliptical longitude) is constantly changing. On the other hand, the latitudes of all stars remain unchanged. The effect of general precession on the ecliptical longitude position of stars (right ascension and declination) varies both with the star and with time and the effect is not that easily calculated (but somewhat dependent on method). The calculation of general precession is simple in ecliptic coordinates – a yearly 50 seconds of arc (approximately) increase in longitude and no change in latitude. It gets more difficult to calculate when expressed in terms of right ascension and declination. (There was an apparent lack of precessional movement by Sirius as viewed at the latitude of ancient Egypt. Sirius was long used by the ancient Egyptians as the foundation for 2 of their calendar systems. The calendar year based on the heliacal rising of Sirius did not vary as the position of Sirius showed no apparent variation. Sirius is affected by precession and does move. The reason there was little apparent variation is Sirius happens to move in such a way that the distance between it and the equinoxes appears to remain approximately constant.) As a basis for calculating the effects of general precession it is necessary to state the equator and equinox of the coordinate system to which any position is referred. (See: Miscellaneous Papers of the University Observatory, Oxford, Issue 385 (1928).)
Stephen McCluskey wrote (Hastro-L, 3-July-2016): "Precession is a slower process than I had suggested. Digging into the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac, I found an approximate formula for precession in declination (which is what influences your azimuth values): d = do + N cos a, where do is the original declination of the star, a is its right ascension, and N is the precession in declination of the pole. N is approximately 0°.5567t, where t is measured in Julian centuries. Since in tropical regions (like Hawaii), the change in azimuth does not differ much from the change in declination, the maximum change in azimuth is about 0.5567 degrees per century. There are further complexities. Nearer the poles, the change in azimuth can be much more than the change in declination. On the other hand, for stars with right ascension near 6 and 18 hours, cos a is near zero and the change in declination and azimuth is negligible. Considering your example of Aldeberan, a ? 4h 36m, so the current rate of change in declination is about 0.203 degrees per century."
That flood stories are really about the precession of the equinoxes - and not catastrophic floods - is a dubious explanation. It is difficult to believe that the extremely slow precessional change, the perception of which requires thousands of years, has originated a world-wide belief in the cataclysmic end of world ages - with flood and fire and the shaking of the terrestrial globe itself. Simply, when one pole star is deemed to be displaced by another, no disaster ensues, either on Earth or in the skies. It is not that easy to decide when some cultures considered a star to be a pole star; especially if there are no known 'rules' or 'traditions' from the corresponding culture that are given.
The collaboration between Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend
Giorgio de Santillana spent the last 10 years of his life collaborating with Hertha von Dechend. (In his 1970 protest letter to the New York Review of Books de Santillana stated that writing Hamlet's Mill "involved ten years of specific studies in technical astronomy, ancient and archaeological history and myth." However, there is little technical astronomy and archaeological history in the book. Its contents are basically myth and philology. A point to be noted is philology/linguistics has undergone dynamic development since the publication of Hamlet's Mill (and needles to say the late 19th-century).) Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend received supportive funding for much of their research in the nature of a grant from the Twentieth Century Fund. (However, a number of other persons, both MIT students and academics, were also involved in the research for the book.) What the Twentieth Century Fund actually funded, or believed it was funding, would be nice to know. Hamlet's Mill is basically and attempt to re-introduce some of the basic ideas of Panbabylonism. The two key ideas of Panbabylonism that the authors attempt to revive are (1) Mesopotamian establishment of an equally divided, 12-constellation zodiac by circa 4000 BCE, and (2) Mesopotamian knowledge of the effects (at least) of precession (and the incorporation of such into ancient mythological themes), by circa 4000 BCE. Abe Aronow, a student at MIT from 1958 to 1962 (and a Platonist in his youth), knew Giorgio de Santillana, Hertha von Dechend, and Harald Reiche. (He also participated in some of the research for Hamlet's Mill. In her 1961 seminar notes Hertha von Dechend openly invites interested listeners to help in the research.) Abe Aronow recollects that Anacalypsis by Godfrey Higgins (2 Volumes; 1833-1836, Reprinted 1965) was a favourite book of Hertha von Dechend. Higgins' Anacalypsis has been described as a monument of painstaking industry, a fact undoubtedly recognised by von Dechend.



According to her co-worker Yas Maeyama (UniReport 5, 2001) in his obituary for von Dechend, her insights developed through close cooperation with Leo Frobenius (1873-1938), Willy Hartner (1905-1981), and Giorgio de Santillana (1902-1974). I believe this is very much a misunderstanding and an attempt at establishing a pedigree for her ideas. There is no doubt she was influenced by Leo Frobenius. (Frobenius was a proponent of the astro-mythological approach and a diffusionist.) There is no doubt she influenced both Willy Hartner and Giorgio de Santillana. It was von Dechend who decided how myths should be astronomically interpreted. The pan-solar explanation of world mythology proposed by Frobenius was altered/replaced by von Dechend with her version of the pan-precession mythology of Panbabylonism (likely after Alfred Jeremias). In his article "Willy Hartner" in Encyclopaedia Iranica, Antonio Painano writes: "At the Völkerkundeinstitut of Frankfurt University, directed by the ethnologist Leo Frobenius, Hartner also became acquainted with new methodological trends which inspired his future research." ("Willy Hartner" by Antonio Painano, Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. XII, Fascicle 1, Pages 16-17.) Both von Dechend and Hartner were familiar with the ideas of Frobenius.
A (English-language) book review, "The Thousands of Abū Ma'shar." by Willy Hartner (in which he endorses Hamlet's Mill), is published in The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, (New Series), Volume 104, Issue 1, January, Pages 63-65.
The term astral mythology means occurrences in the heavens are given the form of a narrative, with personifications of heavenly bodies and constellations. Von Dechend was obsessed with reading/reconstructing so-called mythical texts as 'Klartext' i.e., uncoded text, clear text, in understandable form. Critics are deemed incapable of understanding the (astronomical) language of the mythos.
Devotees of Hamlet's Mill make statements such as "Both Santillana and Dechend were at the top of their game in the 1960s." and "Von Dechend was a mainstream/establishment historian." No justification for either of these statements is given. Neither were experts in ancient (pre-classical) history or mythology (or any period). Neither author of Hamlet's Mill concedes they are outside their field of expertise with the study and its claims (as the German assyriologist Peter Jensen did decades earlier with his monumental studies of the Gilgamesh epic and its use for his particular Panbabylonist claims). De Santillana's introduction of the name "the crazy cosmology club" (see below) identifies that he understood the methodology was not rigorous. The name typified the average outsider's attitude towards the seeming lack of rigour in investigative techniques. The misuse and abuse of myth and etymology clearly demonstrates this. Von Dechend was not a mainstream/establishment historian. Basically, she was not an historian. Basically she published almost nothing. She was a Panbabylonist.
Hamlet’s Mill does not provide a genuine account of the archaic past. Whilst von Dechend was very much influenced by Godfrey Higgins the wider works setting out the themes were Helena Blavatsky's 2 massive books, Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine. Higgins was influenced by Drummond, Bailly, and Dupuis. His massive 2-volume Anacalypsis reflects their ideas. Through von Dechend use of Anacalypsis these authors and their ideas became incorporated into Hamlet's Mill.
Whilst de Santillana is identified as the senior author the book is basically by von Dechend. De Santillana credits the appendices to von Dechend. (De Santillana, Hamlet's Mill, Page viii) writes of von Dechend's "scornful indignation" in the appendices.) However, a mere cursory examination of the MIT seminar notes by von Dechend demonstrates the contents of Hamlet's Mill is based upon them. There is nothing to indicate - indeed the known facts suggest - there existed no close cooperation between von Dechend and de Santillana for the production of the manuscript that was published as Hamlet's Mill. De Santillana was involved in a 'rescue effort' that worked from MIT student seminar notes and von Dechend force fitted numerous dated appendices that she had mostly written years before for other purposes. There is nothing to suggest she made any effort in finalising the main body of text. Nothing suggests that de Santillana prevented her from doing so. It is suggested that von Dechend was simply uninvolved to any great degree by her own choice. It is indicated she had problems bringing projects to completion.
Note: There is little doubt that de Santillana also acted as editor for von Dechend's appendices included in Hamlet's Mill.
Note: It is still common for the misspelling Georgio to be used instead of correctly, Giorgio.
Von Dechend's Preface to the 1993 German edition of Hamlet's Mill
In her Preface to the 1993 German-language edition of Hamlet's Mill von Dechend writes that of more than 22 years of intensive work since the 1st appearance of Hamlet's Mill in 1969. However, instead of a renovated and expanded text that she acknowledges would be appropriate she states she was basically limited to additional footnotes and appendices. The appendices of Hamlet's Mill were largely comprised of the chapter end notes accompanying the text of her seminar notes.
Both she and de Santillana had a deep-seated discomfort with the prevailing interpretation and evaluation of traditions prior to the Hellenistic period.
She and de Santillana became acquainted at the occasion of the 1958 Willy Hartner symposium organised by the Frankfurt Institute for History of Natural Sciences. After completing her Habilitation in 1959 she sent de Santillana a short treatise on common ideas in ancient India, China, and America associated with the constellation Sagittarius, and her historical conclusions. In response de Santillana successfully arranged, through the Sloan Foundation, a graduate scholarship for her at MIT. Later he successfully arranged other funding for her. (There is no evidence that von Dechend taught any courses at MIT. It is now not known whether she ever had official status for teaching or grading. Von Dechend likely mostly lived on 'soft money' during her time at MIT (after the graduate scholarship funding ended). That is, a project was funded from grants rather than von Dechend herself being funded directly.)
Beginning in the Fall of 1960 she spent a few months for several years at MIT. She and de Santillana shared the topic of archaic cosmology and held seminars. Note: The first mention of Hertha von Dechend at MIT that I am aware of is the mention in Technology Review, Volume 62, 1960, Page 76: "Herta von Dechend, Germany, protohistoric material of myths and legends; ...." It appears it was mentioned as a talk given by von Dechend. The term "protohistoric material of myths and legends" appeared in Giorgio de Santillana's forthcoming book, The Origins of Scientific Thought (1961, Page 13). The expression embodies the theme that hero myths and associated myths can be deciphered as the technical language of yet unknown archaic astronomers who are responsible for the naming of the constellations. Note: There is no common source for the recognition of constellations across ancient cultures.
Interestingly, von Dechend admitted she is a procrastinator regarding publishing. (Her draft manuscript Archeoastronomy (completed 1997) remained unfinished and unpublished.) She states that when de Santillana understood she would not proceed to publication with her astronomical interpretation of mythology (with her work he had encouraged at MIT) he suggested joint publication. (Her procrastination also appears to be the basis for her failure to suitably assist de Santillana to edit her notes into a suitable book and include more expansive materials.) De Santillana wrote the text and she wrote the appendices and footnotes. (It is evident that de Santillana used her seminar notes to write the text of the book. Many of the illustrations used are from her seminar notes. The appendices originate from her seminar notes. This meant she really was involved in very little labour with her contribution to the book.)



Note: Von Dechend's procrastination is not a minor issue. In the 1960s, to procrastinate for her own contentment, regardless of funding given and use made of MIT students as researchers, and to procrastinate for another 2 decades leaving the book effectively unrevised, yet remain assertive regarding her work, methods, and conclusions is simply astonishing. Her scholarly publications were absolutely minimal. In the 1960s, Hamlet's Mill was to have been her book. However, she simply let de Santillana put her notes into shape for the book chapters. It is unknown how closely de Santilana had been following the supposed production of the book by her. There is little doubt she accumulated a large amount of material. How well she assimilated it is not is not really known. She simply interpreted it according to her predilections. Planned works were never completed by her. She was dismissive of scholars who held views opposing her own. She remained assertive with her views and conclusions. Basically, she believed that everybody else was wrong and that she had the correct answers.
Von Dechend states she wanted to have nothing to do with the history of astronomy until the subject of her post-doctoral work on complex myths. (Her PhD was completed during WWII.) Her astronomical approach originated with her attempt to understand Polynesian mythology (particularly the creator god Kane). The 10,000 pages of Polynesian mythology she states in Hamlet's Mill (1969) she read means she merely read more than 10,000 pages of books (i.e., secondary sources) on Polynesian mythology. As example: Hamlet's Mill, Page VIII: "What could it mean, when a hero (Aukelenuiaiku (Aukele), the name of a hero who sought the water of life (a hero's quest)) was on his way slightly more than two years, 'returning' at intervals, 'falling into space,' coming off the 'right' route? [This comes from his wife's instruction (Fornander, end of Chapter XII): "I will show you the way. From this place where we are standing you must go straight to the rising sun, where you will obtain the water of everlasting life of Kane."] There remained, indeed, not many possible solutions: it had to be planets (in the particular case of Aukele-nuia-iku, Mars)." The source for von Dechend is "Chapter XIII. How Aukelenuiaiku Went in Search of the Water of Life of Kane." In: Hawaiian Antiquities and Folk-Lore by Abraham Fornander (1916, Page 82). I do not see "two years" and "returning at intervals" in the story. Fornander did not make the identification, Mars. The source for the identification seems to be von Dechend, but nobody references Hamlet’s Mill for this. (It is worth commenting that Hamlet's Mill hardly comprises a 'chapter' in the history of astronomy.)
Von Dechend believed that there was a source for the knowledge of the Polynesian master navigators. When, in late 1956, she read Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel by Franz Kugler she decided that Babylonian astronomical knowledge was the initial impetus for Polynesian astronomical knowledge. Though Babylonian astronomy from the 7th-century BCE is stated in a scientific manner, the preceding astronomy is saturated with mythological ideas. (Hence her conclusion that our myths are the remnants of a preliterate astronomy.) The 3 sky bands or sky zones (divisions of the sky) of Polynesian astronomical tradition derive ultimately from Mesopotamian astronomy. (As far a I am aware the Polynesian 3 sections of the celestial hemisphere comprised a triple heaven consisting of 3 hemispherical zones.)
Provisional (rough) draft translation of most of the Preface to the 1993 German edition of Hamlet's Mill
"Preface to the German edition (Vorwort zur deutschen Ausgabe).
Between the first appearance of Hamlet's Mill (1969) and this German translation edition (1993) there have been more than 22 years of continued intensive work. Thus, it would actually be most appropriate to submit a rewritten and significantly expanded text that incorporates the results of this work. Be that as it may there were compelling reasons why I was mainly limited to only to additional footnotes and appendices, amending several passages and expanding others, and replacing the Preface and concluding remarks of the original book with new ones. Giorgio de Santillana and I first met and got to know each other on the occasion of a 1958 symposium organized by Willy Hartner in Frankfurt at the Institute for History of Science, where I was at that time an assistant. After completing my Habilitation in 1959 I sent de Santillana a short treatise on the my ideas concerning the constellation Sagittarius in ancient times in India, China and Ancient America and the conclusions that could be drawn concerning ideas in ancient times that were relevant to the history of astronomy. In response, de Santillana applied to the Sloan Foundation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for funding for graduate scholarship for me and this was granted. Later, he applied successfully for other funding.
It seems that de Santillana and other academics were well versed in obtaining funding. The National Science Foundation awarded a travel grant to de Santillana (as well as 13 other American academics) to enable them to attend the 8th International Congress for the History of Science, and the 4th general assembly of the International Union for the History of Science, held at Florence and Milan, 3-10 September 1956.
Beginning with the autumn of 1960, I spent several years - in each case a few months - in Cambridge (Massachusetts), where de Santillana and I shared the presentation of History of Cosmology Seminars at MIT. During the course of holding the seminars I worked on an as yet unnamed Opus. Over time de Santillana concluded that I would simply continue to work with the material in an unhurried manner and without aiming for a completion date for the publication of the study, and he suggested a joint publication. With this agreed upon he exercised some some pressure to ensure a completion date and publication. De Santillana rewrote the manuscript as it existed. He also gave the book greater focus by working on ensuring the frequent deviations away from the main discussion points were straightened out. He brought his own ideas on archaic history to bear and he also brought his high stylistic skill to writing the book to ensure that it should not just be read by professional academics alone.
"Free reign" remained with me in the content of the appendices and the footnotes. In 1967, 2 years before the appearance of Hamlet's Mill, de Santillana wrote in the preface to Reflections on Men and Ideas [1968, xi], a collection of 26 of his shorter works: "My latest productions are a definite move into a field that had long attracted me, far from ordinary research and the usual tools, remote from the usual documentary material. The few samples that I present („Riflessioni sul Fato”, „Les Grandes Doctrines Cosmologiques”) stand for a new approach and a new method which may yet be deemed uninsurable by our more cautious contemporaries but that it has a point I have no doubt. It is the greatness of the subject that has called me, the prodigious wealth of mythical material gathered over the centuries, immense vistas of lost milleniums, of submerged cultures for which we may have found a key. Judgement must wait for our forthcoming book written in collaboration with Dr. von Dechend, „An Introduction to Archaic Cosmology”. But whatever fate awaits this last enterprise of my latter years, and be it that of Odysseus' last voyage, I feel comforted by the awareness that it shall still be the right conclusion of a life dedicated to the search for truth."
De Santillana's background training was physics and he was able to employ his thorough knowledge of ancient natural philosophy and the history of the exact sciences to his interest in the history of ideas. My background was in cultural-historical ethnology - more precisely: the school of ideas developed by Leo Frobenius. Together. de Santillana and I had a deep-seated unease with the prevailing interpretation and evaluation of traditions, and the origins of scientific thought. To an extent there has been a problem created with misunderstanding the ancient use of words. Also a problem is the simple faith in steady cultural progress in terms of evolutionary development. There is also the issue of writing versus verbal tradition in conveying knowledge. In the transmission of knowledge we need to remain vigilant and give attention to the emergence of new conceivable alternatives. Suspicions regarding the viability of orthodox anthropological explanations of cultural development occurred to me after a few semesters of anthropological studies before WWII. After WWII the work of Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen with the Dogon and Bambara in western Sudan became accessible. Particularly, Griaule’ Dieu d'Eau (1948)), in which simple African farmers, through their traditions, are guardians of ancient oriental “High Culture." Later I had the honor and the pleasure to collaborate with Hermann Baumann whose Opus was Das doppelte Geschlecht: Ethnologische Studien zur Bisexualität in Ritus und Mythus (1955). [Also important: "The division of work according to sex in African hoe culture." (Africa, Volume 1, Number 3, July, 1928, Pages 289-319).] His work describing the complexity of the so-called



"primitive agriculturalist" helped prove them as descendants of Near Eastern civilization. This was a decisive breach in the beaten fabric of vulgar evolutionist Kulturhistoriographie. I hope to add further to this in later publications.
Since I originally had no intention of wanting to focus on the history of astronomy I chose for the subject of the habilitation thesis the myths around the complex Deus Faber - Enki / Ea in Mesopotamia, Ptah in Egypt, Tvashtri in India, Tane / Kane in Polynesia, Hephaestus, Wieland, Goibniu etc. The first chapter was Enki / Ea and contained not a word about the stars, let alone the planets. The second, dedicated to the Polynesian Tane / Kane, was already finished and typed, as the discomfort I felt turned into despair, because I had not understood a word I had read from the more than ten thousand pages of Polynesian myths. Could it be assumed that the first-born "initiates" among the best navigators on the globe had to memorize a conglomerate of purely entertaining stories? There was a felt obligation to ask about the meaning of these traditions.
In the off chance of any enlightenment I read the available publications on the archaeology of the Oceanic island kingdom and came across one on Necker Island belonging to the Hawaiian group, but 500 km away from the nearest island. Necker Island is fishhook shaped, about one kilometer long, no trees grow there, only sparse grass and a few bushes. Since freshwater is extremely scarce, the island is uninhabited by people but is, instead, inhabited by thousands of birds. Nevertheless, the island has 33 megalithic places of worship in addition to several terraces and stone human figures. This startling finding raises the question of who probably built the facility and whether there are other outlying islands similar to Necker Island. Necker Iceland lies almost exactly on the Tropic of Cancer. This circumstance caused me to consider the islands at the Tropic of Capricorn for similar cult centres. The closest islands are Tubuai [located south of the Tropic of Capricorn] and Raivavae [located just south of the Tropic of Capricorn]. Both islands have numerous remarkable stone ruins. Moreover Tubuai plays a major, enigmatic role in the Tahitian cosmogony. There are no islands precisely on the Equator, but the nearest (Fanning [Tabuaeran, just north of the Equator], Maiden [south of the Equator], Christmas [Kiritimati, north of the Equator]) have numerous stone ruins. It appears as if the Polynesians marked out the Ecliptic as neatly as the geographical circumstances allowed.
There was no longer any intent for me to shirk astronomy - and Chapter II, Deus Faber-work had a second part under the title "Retrial" to be discussed. Sun myths could be relatively easy to identify, but the adventures of "gods" and "cultural heroes" still made little sense.
The Polynesian master navigators, within their techniques and framework of celestial motions "tell" about the division of the sky into "3-ways" and I came to the ancient Near East "source" for all the "high culture belt" ideas: i.e., I obtained (Christmas Eve 1956) Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel by Franz Xaver Kugler. The author, inter alia, notes (II, 10f), changes from the 7th-century BCE. In the context of Babylonian "scientific astronomy," i.e., Positional Astronomy, the texts from the 7th-century BCE showed "not the slightest astrological or mythological colouring." Before the 7th-century BCE almost the entire astronomy of Babylonia was imbued with mythological ideas. In other words: before the 7th-century BCE astronomers agreed "in mythical." This appears to be somewhat the extent of her reading about the early history of astronomy in the Near East.
The way forward was found almost by itself, especially since the identification of Plato as a source of knowledge - the earlier source was Mesopotamian astronomy.
That the views outlined here would encounter manifold rejection was to be expected. De Santillana and I were committed to the task of restoring the battered reputation of our early intellectual ancestors. It was hoped that critics would be considerate. (Reproaches, included that Hipparchus and knowledge of precession was "skipped" and the authors had simply moved past the core of the problems.)
And now we go as far as possible on the journey into the interior of the giant clock that forms the archaic cosmos and as understood in ancient times as a mill - more precisely defined - not as a modern continuously rotating "Mill" but as involving an alternating movement such as a hand held Drill.
Friends of mine to be thanked for their vigorous support and frequent encouragement: Emma Duchane and Jayant Shah, Jerome Lettvin and Philip Morrison, and especially Harald A. T. Reiche with his profound knowledge of the ancient world, with salutary skepticism and rigorous criticism tirelessly available. Furthermore I'm greatly indebted to Beate Ziegs for her dedication and competence with the translation.
Kronberg / Taunus [Kronberg im Taunus], in August 1992 by Hertha Dechend"
Obviously von Dechend held Hermann Baumann in high esteem. Baumann related his ideas to Leo Frobenius and Bernhard Ankemann. All 3 were specialists in African ethnology. All 3 were diffusionists. Nobody today teaches the ideas of Hermann Baumann.
Excursus: Visual story telling
The earliest narratives in Mesopotamia prior to the development of cuneiform writing were visual. Two examples of visual story telling are the Uruk Vases and Cylinder Seals. The arrangement of visual information on cylinder seals in several registers - one above the other - has been proposed as the basic principle of all 3rd-millennium BCE Mesopotamian narratives. The multi-register representations enable the widening of temporal sequences. The reading direction of the temporal sequence of events always starts with the bottom register, reaching its end point at the top. The Uruk Vases provide good examples for such an arrangement. Read from the bottom to the top, the sequence of pictures (through a series of registers in low relief) tell a coherent complex, visual story (i.e., a series of events). One example is the "Presentation of offerings to Inanna." It has been suggested that the sequence of pictures on the Uruk Vases also indicate a cosmological context. The narration of a structured story through stand-alone visual storytelling (i.e., independent of any verbal or written aid) is evident as early as the 4th-millennium BCE with the Warka vase. (Dated circa 3200-3000 BCE.) Written historical narratives are not attested before the Fara-Period (towards the end of the Early Dynastic Period), circa 2600–2500 BCE. The Fara period is when syllabic writing began. The few extant specimens of an early Mesopotamian literature are still not successfully understood.

Provisional (rough) draft translation of most of the Afterword by the Editor to the 1993 German edition of Hamlet's Mill
Afterword by the Editor (Nachwort des Herausgebers)
"The appearance of the German edition of the book Hamlet's Mill: An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend in a completely revamped and expanded form has been a successful 5-year process. My thanks go to Hertha Dechend and all for making a consistent, authorised translation possible and also the opportunity to considerably revise the book. There has been considerable reshaping and revision of the book, taking into account further recent research findings since the publication of the first edition in 1969, and also to expand the book as well as write a new Preface and Afterward. The realization of this edition of the book and the fulfillment of high standards would probably not have succeeded if not Beate Ziegs, in the task of translation of the first edition, worked in continuous close collaboration with Hertha von Dechend over more than 3 years. In the course of this work, where necessary, the German equivalents of all source texts and the



American edition of further quotes were identified in consultation with the author and placed in the text. The bibliography was amended accordingly and revised throughout. Involved in the development of the final version were the 2 proofreaders, Lisa Steinhauser and Sabine Süss, who have also contributed to the extraordinarily extensive bibliography and the compilation of the index. Their work in the completion of the first printed German version has taken more than a year. The additions and improvements continued until the master copy was considered finally completed in September 1993. The contents of the book speculate at the border regions of science. Astronomy is held to be the principal basis of myth. This view results in backdating the beginnings of science and the re-evaluation of culture. This has caused considerable defensive reactions amongst German intellectuals with an interest in the history of culture. But hardly any of them have read the book. This easily accessible and readable edition of Hamlet's Mill should enable further discussions and controversies. Berlin, September 1993, Rolf Herken"
List of Figures (Abbildungsverzeichnis) "For the procurement of templates for most pictures we are greatly indebted to Katharina Lommel, formerly at the National Museum of Ethnology in Munich."
It is obvious that in the 22 years since the first publication, von Dechend had basically done nothing to improve the contents of the book. The original chapter material still remains.
Hermann Baumann
Hermann Baumann (1902-1972) was a German anthropologist and Africanist who was a representative of Kulturhistorie and diffusionism and who opposed the ideas of Kulturkreislehre. He emphasized the importance of single case studies on ethnic groups as well as the research on cultural exchange among several groups in a broader historical context. He believed an Asiatic (Near Eastern) High-Culture swept from the East across Sudan superimposing its ideas on native culture.
From 1931 Hermann Baumann was the head of the Eurasian Department of the Berlin Ethnological Museum (now the Berlin Museum of Ethnology and editor of the Journal of Ethnology. He was appointed a Professor at the University of Vienna (1939-1945 ). He also joined the Nazi party. Baumann was allowed to teach again soon after the end of WWII. After WWII he taught at the Institute of Ethnology in Munich and at the Institute of Ethnology and African Studies at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University (1955-1972 ). He conducted several field trips to Angola between 1930 and 1972. His material (slides, notebooks and other documents and manuscripts) concerning his research in Angola in 1954 (and concerning the history and ethnography of Angola) is with the Archives at the Frobenius-Institut (which is affiliated with the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt am Main). See: "Hermann Baumann and his early concept of African cultures." In: Culture history and African anthropology: a century of research in Germany and Austria by Jürgen Zwernemann (1983, Pages 86-88). Baumann adhered to the moderate culture-historical approach represented by Bernhard Ankermann (1859-1943, a specialist in African ethnology). At its core was the idea of the spread of archaic civilisation with its centre in the Ancient Orient. (There are some affinities with the 19th-century Hamitic theory. See: The Lost White Tribe by Michael Robinson (2016).) The culture-historical approach held that culture radiated out from the first high civilisations to primitive peoples through diffusion. Bernard Ankermann argued that Asian culture "... brought new impulses to a stagnating Negro culture... ." The concept of "culture circles" was originally proposed by Leo Frobenius in 1898 but it was Fritz Gräbner (Friedrich Graebner) and Bernhard Ankermann who made the concept of "culture circles" (Kulturkreise) acceptable to their academic colleagues. It is evident that both Graebner and Ankermann were influenced by Frobenius when he was researching in the Berlin Museum of Ethnology where they were employed as curators at the time.
The Culture-Circle School (the German and Austrian diffusionists) argued for a number of High-Culture centres. Diffusion was held to proceed, not through the adoption of isolated elements, rather through the transmission (mainly through migration) of a whole culture complex, "a group of elements in organic unity" according to Fritz Gräbner (Friedrich Graebner).
During the Hitler era in Germany, Baumann was a strong proponent of the Nazi ideology. He was a member of the National Socialist German Workers Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, NSDAP) and after World War II was required to obtain an Allied Forces denazification certificate. The last defence of "culture history" before its ultimate demise was the posthumously published Die Völker Afrikas und ihre traditionellen Kulturen. Teil i. Attgemeiner Teil und südliches Afrika edited by Hermann Baumann (1975).

It is interesting that von Dechend held to the outmoded concept of the migration (or at least the migration of the ideas) of a Near Eastern HighCulture. As an ethnologist by training, von Dechend obviously held onto the outmoded theory of "culture circles" past the time of its final demise in the 1970s. In Introduction to Ancient Cosmology (1966, Page 24) she states that Hermann Baumann is the "greatest ethnologist of our time."
Also interesting is von Dechend's concept of what constitutes a High-Culture. "Thus, I play with the idea to circumscribe the coming-into-being of High Culture by the term "Explosion of mathematics" because, what appears to have happened some time at the end of the Upper Palaeolithic was the discovery of number. Whence we have to direct our attention to the 'idea' of number, and of 'symmetry'." (Introduction to Ancient Cosmology by Hertha von Dechend (1979), Page 27.)
Von Dechend's selective use of Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel by Franz Kugler
Von Dechend identifies that she wrote the footnotes and appendices for Hamlet's Mill. She also identifies that she consulted Franz Kugler's Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel. She acknowledges that Kugler identifies Babylonian scientific astronomy existed only from the 7th-century BCE. Within the volumes of SSB, Kugler set out a critique of Panababylonism, and also the evidence for a late (1st-millenium BCE) origin of the zodiac. However, von Dechend prefers to 'cherry pick' what she will use from SSB and basically ignores the volumes. (It is indicated that she only referred to it once.) In Hamlet's Mill she writes page 144, note 12: "Here, we leave out of consideration the much discussed question of exactly when signs of equal length were first introduced; allegedly it was very late (see below, p. 431, n. 1). The actual constellations differ widely in length--the huge Scorpion, e.g., covers many more degrees than 30, whereas the Ram is of modest dimensions. One would think that this lack of uniformity would have so hampered the ancient astronomers in making their calculations that they would have worked out a more convenient frame of coordinates in sheer self-defense." This simply ignores informed discussion of the origin of the zodiac and proceeds with preferred assumptions. The preferred assumptions are drawn from Panbabylonism.
Entirely ignored are Kugler's decisive arguments against an early scientific astronomy in Mesopotamia. Entirely ignored also are Kugler's decisive arguments against the astral claims of Panbabylonism. The authors of Hamlet's Mill simply avoid Panbabylonism, even though they are



proponents of such. Kugler's penetrating technical analysis of Babylonian mathematical methods in (late) astronomical cuneiform texts was not something that the Panbabylonists could match.
Von Dechend does not seem to have made any real effort to understand the history of Mesopotamian astronomy.
In her Preface to the 1993 German edition of Hamlet's Mill, von Dechend wrote that she obtained on Christmas Eve 1956, Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel by Franz Xaver Kugler. Von Dechend then sets out that Kugler in "B. Der astronomische Gehalt der älteren (insbesondere assyrischen) Texte (die spätestens dem 7. Jahihundert v. Chr. angehören)." (Volume 2, Part 1, Pages 10-12) [Draft translation = B. The astronomical content of the earlier (in particular Assyrian) texts (belonging to no later than the 7th Jahihundert v. Chr.).] states that texts from the 7th-century BCE onward show changes in language. There is a move towards a more rigorous positional (i.e., "scientific") astronomy in which the texts are without any astrological or mythological content. Von Dechend then states that before the 7th-century BCE almost the entire astronomy of Babylonia was imbued with mythological ideas. In other words: before the 7th-century BCE astronomers agreed "in mythical." It seems to have escaped von Dechend that what Kugler was actually saying and what she took his words to mean are entirely different. Kugler is setting out that there was an absence of scientific astronomy, i.e., exactness, before the 7th-century BCE. Also, the 'primitive astronomy' that existed was mingled with omenology and astral worship (mythology). It gave precedence to astral divination. (This lack of exactness extended to calendar systems.) The astronomical texts were non-mathematical and closely related to the Enuma Anu Enlil divination series. According to Kugler, by circa 700 BCE of the Assyrian period the astronomy texts show a clear distinction between astronomical and astrological activity. Also, astronomical texts of the last 4 centuries BCE are without astrological or mythological content. Before the 7th-century BCE it was a different matter; almost the whole of astronomy was steeped in mythological ideas. However, Kugler is not proposing myth as a technical language. Von Dechend - for whatever reason - has substitute myth for divination - and changed the sense of what Kugler is discussing. Kugler is stating there is a lack of anything exact or scientific. Inexact astronomy is mingled with omenology/divination and myth, not supplanted by them. Elsewhere Kugler makes it clear that he believes the texts indicate that Babylonian astronomy originated from astral worship and astrology. According to Hamlet's Mill, Mesopotamia was deemed to be the prime High-Culture location. There is no support for this idea in Kugler's volumes on Babylonian astronomy. We perhaps have here an example of how von Dechend filtered information.
Kugler's view was that scientific astronomy in Babylonia went back to the 8th-century BCE. It developed out of earlier astrology. Also, the astral elements of Babylonian religion was connected with the early astrological beliefs. (The valuable ephemerides tablet Strassmaier Kambyses 400, dated 523 BCE, was regarded by Kugler as the (then) oldest known document of the scientific astronomy of the Babylonians.) Kugler held that the early history of astral omens is closely interrelated to astronomy. (See: SSB Ergan., 1913, Pages 10-17.) Kugler believed that astral beliefs and astral omens originating during the Old Babylonian period eventually led to an increasing level of formalised sky observations that eventually resulted in scientific astronomy. Perhaps the only point on which Kugler agreed with the Panbabylonists was that the origin of 'astrology,' as an expression of religious sentiment, historically preceded astronomy. This viewpoint by Kugler was the product of research results of the early 20thcentury. In his SSB Kugler viewed astral religion as the most noble (highest) form of polytheism. (Kugler did not view astral religion as a primitive aspect of religious behaviour and belief. He viewed it as the highest expression of polytheism.) According to Kugler 'astrology' was also the mother of astronomy. 'Astrology' was found upstream of a process which necessarily leads to astronomy. Kugler believed that without absolute conviction that the stars were messengers for the destiny of humankind the Babylonians would probably have never concerned themselves - apart from the Sun and Moon as regulators of time – with the scientific study of the stars. See also Kugler's remarks in his Vorwort to SSB1, 1907 regarding the above. Interestingly, Morris Jastrow pointed out (1911, Page 256): "In Babylonia and Assyria we have first 'astrology' and astronomy afterwards, in Greece we have the sequence reversed: astronomy first and astrology afterwards." Mathematical astrology did not come into existence until circa the commencement of the Christian era.
Primitive forms of celestial divination or astrology did not stimulate the growth of scientific astronomy. The American assyriologist Erica Reiner (1924-2005) believed that omen astronomy and mathematical astronomy were separate disciplines of scholarship; especially from the 5th-century BCE onwards. Omens had importance in the Neo-Assyrian empire. The pinnacle of Babylonian astrological influence was reached during the Hellenistic period. Astrology, based on an ancient Babylonian and Egyptian astral beliefs, took shape in the 3rd-century BCE. Extispicy (divination using entrails of sacrificed animals) was astrology's closest rival. Also, "The computational systems of Babylonian mathematical astronomy, which emerged at about the same time as did horoscopic astrology, cannot be accounted for by reason of their serving astrological purposes." (Rochberg, Francesca. "Babylonian Horoscopy: the Texts and their Relations." In: Swerdlow, Noel. (Editor). Ancient Astronomy and Celestial Divination. (1999, Pages 39-59; Page 55).
The last joint publication by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend
The last joint publication by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend was a conference paper that appeared in 1970. I am not aware of who presented the paper. (See: "Sirius as a permanent center in the archaic universe." by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend. In: Enrico Castelli (Editor). Eternità e storia (1970). (Pages 235-263). The publication in which the paper appears is a collection of 1968 conference papers presented in Rome. Other details: I Valori Permanenti nel Divenire Storico. Atti del Convegno Internationale promosso delT Istituto Accademico di Roma, Roma 3.-6.10.1968.)
Work on the manuscript of Hamlet's Mill
Hamlet's Mill has been described as a dialectical account. This approach would have been de Santillana's choice.
Work on the manuscript of Hamlet's Mill had begun in 1967. Peter Tompkins wrote that Hertha von Dechend was beginning to write her book, Hamlet's Mill, circa 1961. (In his book Secrets of the Great Pyramid (1971) Peter Tompkins write: "About ten years ago I exchanged manuscripts with Hertha von Dechend, who was then beginning to write her book Hamlet's Mill.") I am disinclined to believe she had any kind of working manuscript circa 1961 (but it is indicated there was one - perhaps a few years later). The Amrican academic Livio Stecchini wrote in 1961: "Studies now being pursued by Hertha von Dechend indicate that advanced astronomical information had been gathered before the origin of writing; written documents indicate that the observations were initiated in the fourth millenium B.C. At the same time, she is showing that very early myths have much more precise and meaningful structure than it has been believed." ("The Origin of the Alphabet." by Livio Stecchini (The American Behavioural Scientist, February 1, 1961, Volume 4, Issue 6, Pages 3-7, Page 4).) It is more likely that von Dechend only had seminar notes for that year (i.e., 1961, unless her Habilitation is included). According to a 1977 article in Technology Review (published by MIT) "for the past twenty years Professor von Dechend has been comparing and assembling the pieces of an immense puzzle ...." This would place her idea back to 1957 at least. Giorgio de Santillana first met Hertha von Dechend when he participated in a symposium organised by Willy Hartner at the Institut für Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften, in Frankfurt, in 1958. She was developing her ideas by that time. It would seem, however, that the ideas of Hamlet's Mill were first publicly put forward by de Santillana in an address given at a 1961 symposium in England. (See his presentation: "On Forgotten Sources in the History of Science" In: Crombie, A. (Editor). Scientific Change (1963), Pages 813-828, with participant commentary in succeeding pages. The book comprises the Symposium on the History of Science at the University of Oxford, 9-15 July, 1961. In the content of the book he acknowledges his great debt to Hertha von Dechend (who declined to be acknowledged as a joint author) and considers it a joint



paper. Incredibly, he considered Charles Dupuis a reliable authority on ancient astronomy. Later, in Hamlet's Mill, he claimed only a fleeting familiarity with Charles Dupuis.) Interestingly, Hertha von Dechend is listed as a member of the 1961 Symposium - but Giorgio de Santillana is not. (Amongst the listed papers of Joseph Needham held at Cambridge (England) the following record appears: Title: Joseph Needham's notes from a talk on 'astral myths' by Herta (sic) von Dechend at a Symposium in Oxford; Reference: SCC2/69/1/28; Covering Dates: 13 July 1961; Extent and Medium: 1 document; Paper.) Hertha von Dechend (An Introduction to Archaic Cosmology (1979)) also endorsed Charles Dupuis as properly understanding ancient religion per "Mythology is the work of science; only science will explain mythology."
Though Alistair Crombie (1915-1996, an Australian historian of science who began his career as a zoologist) was a close academic friend of Giorgio de Santillana it appears that he was too reality and data oriented to be involved in Hamlet's Mill speculations.
The committee of the Associazione Culturale Italiana invited de Santillana to give a lecture in Turin in March, 1963, entitled "Fato antico e fato moderno" ("Ancient and Modern Ideas of Fate" or "Ancient and Modern Fate"). One of the major points of the lecture was the idea that "the great cosmological myths both preceded and had been the equivalent of modern science." Fato Antico e Fato Moderno by Giorgio de Santillana was published in 1963. ("When lecturing in Italy in 1963 Giorgio de Santillana restated the theory that a scientific hypothesis precedes the formulation of a myth." (Understanding Italo Calvino by Beno Weiss (1993, Page 95).)) In the Preface to his book Reflections on Men and Ideas (1968, Page xi) Giorgio de Santillana mentions a forthcoming book by himself in collaboration with Hertha von Dechend with the (working) title An Introduction to Archaic Cosmology. De Santillana presented similar ideas at an international colloquium organised by UNESCO (Science and Synthesis (Published 1971)). He presented on modern cosmologies within the historical perspective of the ancient cosmological doctrines: "The Great Cosmological Doctrines."
Note: Regarding Italo Calvino. It is known from his essays and letters that Giorgio de Santillana had considerable impact on Italo Calvino (19231985, an Italian journalist and brilliant writer of short stories and novels) since their first encounter in Boston in 1959.
In the latter pages of her, Introduction to Ancient Cosmology (Hertha von Dechend's lecture notes for the Autumn 1966 seminar(s)) von Dechend several times writes of the 'Essay' by de Santillana and her that is being prepared for publication.
A copy of a heavily edited older manuscript of Hamlet’s Mill - that was in the possession of Abe Aronow - has perhaps been lost during a house move to San Francisco. This mimeographed manuscript is recollected as having been distributed sometime between 1961 and 1963. (It would have remained in manuscript form had not de Santillana offered to co-author the book.) I am inclined to think that the earliest so-called manuscript was perhaps little more than her first seminar notes.
Franz Krojer states that in conversation with von Dechend she stated she had immense difficulties with the book; some of it to do with the preparation of the appendices. (See: "Der Riss zwischen den beiden Kulturen" ["The rift between the two cultures"] In: Franz Krojer (with a
contribution by Thomas Schmidt): Die Präzision der Präzession, Illigs mittelalterliche Phantomzeit aus astronomischer Sicht. [The precision of precession, Illig's medieval phantom time from an astronomical point of view.] (2003).)
De Santillana and von Dechend jointly presented at the MIT (Alumni?) Seminar 1964.
The 'assembling' of Hamlet's Mill
It is usually stated that the book was basically written by Giorgio de Santillana. However, Hertha von Dechend states that she worked on the manuscript of the book during the 1960s. (This is supported by comments by Harald Reiche in his essay included in the book Astronomy of the Ancients (1979) edited by Kenneth Brecher and Michael Feirtag.) Whilst deemed a collaborative work the greater content and framework of ideas are those of Hertha von Dechend. There is little doubt that the numerous lengthy appendices were exclusively written by Hertha von Dechend. (This is stated by Santillana within the Preface of the book, see page viii.) It is also easy to discern that the greater contents of the book are von Dechend's work and owes much to her early MIT seminars. (It is a mistake to think the first two-thirds of the book is the work of de Santillana and the last one-third (the appendices) is the work of von Dechend. Almost the entire book is closely based on von Dechend's MIT lecture/seminar notes.) The book is largely a collection of material grouped into various categories and lacking a clear focus. During 1961, 1966, and 1979 Hertha von Dechend (when a research associate at MIT) delivered (or help to deliver) seminars on ancient cosmology at MIT. Note: De Santillana and von Dechend jointly presented at the MIT (Alumni?) seminar 1964. (It is likely that the 1979 seminar was organised by Harald Reiche.) It appears that for all of these occasions she was hosted i.e., stayed as a house guest with a MIT faculty member. (Abe Aronow, an ex-student of de Santillana, who was a student at MIT from 1962 to early 1966, states that a least during most of the first half of the 1960s von Dechend was a frequent (though largely unidentified) presence in de Santillana's office. Richard Flavin advises that she most often stayed with Harald Reiche and his wife. She also stayed with Jayant Shah and his wife over many years - certainly in late 1991.) (Her lecture notes for these seminars were available for a time and they are full of errors regarding both spelling and sense.) It appears she was never a house guest with the de Santillana's. (The date of the marriage break-up between Giorgio and Dorothy de Santillana would likely help explain this. How much time and attention Giorgio gave Dorothy is unknown.)
The basic role of Giorgio de Santillana as "co-author" was evidently that of editing her English-language material. The problem of the book being poorly organised, and lacking unity and coherence, undoubtedly largely originates from the combination of von Dechend's MIT lecture notes being poorly organised and also the fact that de Santillana was seriously ill at the time of his involvement in the preparation of the manuscript of the book. However, there appear to be fictions here as well. It is common to read statements like: "Santillana was dying at the time, leaving the book chaotic and unedited." In his book The Media Symplex (2001, Page 68) Frank Zingrone writes: "I had the good fortune to be a junior colleague of de Santillana's at MIT, where he was furiously working to finish the book before he died. He just barely managed to do that; it was a heroic battle won with the energetic help of his collaborator, Hertha von Dechend." It would be interesting to identify the earliest mention of de Santillana being seriously ill in the late 1960s. One close MIT academic colleague of de Santillana in the 1960s informs me (August, 2013) that he has no knowledge of the type of illness (and also did not actually confirm that de Santillana was actually suffering at this time from a serious illness. De Santillana died in 1974, some 5 years after the book was completed and published. (Frank Zingrone PhD (1933-2009) was an information scientist who taught at MIT for a number of years.) However, de Santillana's collaborative connection with von Dechend probably had its roots in their 1958 meeting. Undoubtedly, he was probably interested in the theme of an astronomical basis for mythology prior to their 1958 meeting. His somewhat independent thoughts on the issue appeared briefly in his book The Origins of Scientific Thought (1961). De Santillana attempted to marshal the material that is available on the prehistoric origins of science. In this book he attempts to sift out and collect the material available on the prehistoric origins of science. He begins with mythology and attempts to show its astronomical significance. In the book de Santillana holds the origin of Greek science (especially astronomy) can be traced to the Neolithic period. Aspects of the book present a radical and unconventional view of the origins of Greek science. (Edward Madden, Professor of Philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo, wrote a book review of The Origins of Scientific Thought.) See also: "Greek Astronomy." by George de Santillana in Scientific American, (Volume 180?), April, 1949, Pages 44-47. Overlooked, but of some importance is "Fato Antico e Fato Moderno." by Giorgio de Santillana. It is a short essay (first published in 1968?) - originally a lecture (given in 1963). (There appears to be some confusion whether it is a short essay or an



uncommon book.) It deals with the history of science and mythologies and mimics themes in Hamlet's Mill. It views ancient myths as the first attempts at scientific thinking and practice and the ancient practice of measuring and numbering physical reality as an effort to create meaning and make the world/universe accessible. According to de Santillana the ancient concept of fate implied a precise comprehension of physical reality and how we are influenced by it. Myth has a cosmological dimension and humankind's oldest myths derive from celestial observations. See also: "Riflessioni sul Fato : Fato Antico." In: Reflections on Men and Ideas by Giorgio de Santillana (1967; Pages 324-345). See also the essay book review in la Republica, 10 July, 1985. It appears reasonable to assume that during the early 1960s the (flawed) work of the British astronomer Joseph Lockyer (The Dawn of Astronomy (1894)) on the astronomical alignments of Egyptian temples also influenced de Santillana's ideas. Giorgio de Santillana wrote a new and extensive Preface for the 1964 reprint issued by MIT Press. In this Preface de Santillana sketched some of his ideas on archaic astronomy and the astronomical content of mythology. In the Preface de Santillana also expressed his belief that Egyptian temple re-alignment was due to their exact knowledge of the rate of precession. (It appears that Giorgio de Santillana also believed the alphabet originated from astronomy and games.)
Phil Norfleet, at his website(s) containing his recollections of Giorgio de Santillana (which seems to take information and leads from my website material, - nowhere acknowledged - certainly use of a copyright photograph of de Santillana without permission or credit) writes (http://waite2051.tripod.com/): "I first became aware of the Mithraic Mysteries in the early 1960s (one seminar was held in 1964 with von Dechend), when I took two seminars given by the well-known MIT professor of the history of science, Giorgio de Santillana (1902-1974). At that time I was a very young college undergraduate who had been fortunate enough to convince Professor de Santillana that I should be permitted to take his seminars, which were usually reserved for graduate students only. At that time, Professor de Santillana was at the peak of his intellectual powers; in 1961 he had published what I believe was his finest book: The Origins of Scientific Thought from Anaximander to Proclus, 600 B.C. to 500 A.D. He was a good lecturer and was even better in the give and take discussions of the seminar room. A great deal of reading and essay writing was required, but it was very interesting to me and I enjoyed making the necessary extra effort. The main focus of the course was on the early Greek philosophers, who flourished from about 600 to 300 B.C. Professor de Santillana took the position that they had been extremely important in laying the intellectual foundation for the European scientific revolution of the 17th century. We only spent a day or two in discussing the Mithras cult and its significance to the philosophical and astronomical thinking of the Roman Empire. Even so, I do recall at least some of his ideas regarding the connection between the main Mithraic myths and the astronomical knowledge of the time. Many years later, in 1970, I acquired a copy of his last book, which he had co-authored with Dr. Hertha von Dechend (1915-2001) entitled: Hamlet's Mill, An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time. Unfortunately, I was more than a little disappointed in the lack of clarity and poor organization of the book. His main thesis was one which he had also expressed during his seminar; unfortunately, this published work lacked both focus and clarity. I later found out that Professor de Santillana was in failing health at the time and that most of the chapters in the book had really been written by his younger but less well organized colleague.* One area of almost total omission was a discussion of the Mithras belief system, even though this belief system was almost overflowing with astronomical/astrological ideas. Indeed, there was only one reference to Mithra (Mithras) which appeared on pages 263 and 264 of the book (see quotation cited in the Introduction Section). I have recently renewed my interest in the Mithraic belief system after reading the online, current edition of the Rosicrucian Digest; the entire issue is devoted to Mithras. The purpose of this website is to discuss my ideas concerning this rather strange mystery school and also record the ideas of Professor de Santillana on this subject, to the extent that I am able to recall them. It is to the memory of Giorgio Diaz de Santillana that I dedicate this website. By my reckoning, only six of the 23 chapters were written or mostly written by Giorgio!"
John Major Jenkins writes (http://edj.net/mc2012/mill1.htm): "Giorgio de Santillana published a book of his own the previous year and was still lecturing at M.I.T., so his work load during the late 1960s must have been intense."
Hertha von Dechend explained to Franz Krojer that she experienced great difficulties with the book. (See: Die Präzision der Präzession by Franz Krojer (2003, Page 229).
Note: No clear account exists for how the manuscript of Hamlet's Mill came into existence. In fact accounts are contradictory. It seems doubtful that a purposeful progressive independent manuscript for Hamlet's Mill was developed during at least the early 1960s. It is indicated that the only manuscripts were the MIT seminar notes. The earliest cogent manuscript comprised the 1961 MIT course notes with the title, Introduction to Cosmology: A Preliminary Reconnaissance by H. von Dechend [and] G. de Santillana, comprising 152 pages, originally issued in 1961 for the topic "Ancient Cosmology" within the regular Humanities course (XXI-B). Introduction to Ancient Cosmology. Hertha von Dechend's lecture notes for the 1966 seminars were new and expanded course notes with a different approach to presenting the material. In the latter pages von Dechend several times writes of the 'Essay' by de Santillana and her that is being prepared for publication. It is indicated that very little was actually being accomplished. Von Dechend had no useable book manuscript. Circa 1967 de Santillana began drawing from the 1961 and especially the 1966 MIT seminar notes to put together a manuscript for publication. This is the earliest indicated existence of an independent manuscript being prepared for commercial publication. Undoubtedly feedback comments and contributions were sought for the 1961 and 1966 MIT seminar notes and were drawn on for the manuscript in preparation for Hamlet's Mill. Ensuring the material from the 1966 MIT seminar notes were made useful/useable would have presented some difficulties. These were editing difficulties; also the 1966 MIT seminar notes have innumerable typing errors, erratic page numbering, and almost complete of lack section headings. The actual manuscript for Hamlet's Mill is a late creation - a salvage effort - largely accomplished by de Santillana, and closely identifiable with the 1961 and 1966 MIT participant notes.
Development of the commercial manuscript of Hamlet's Mill
Author Text
(1) Hertha von Dechend
1960 - Habilitation completed in 1960. The topic of her thesis was archaic science: Der Mythos von gebauten Welt als Ausdrucksform archaischer Naturwissenschaft. [The myth of the built world as an expression of archaic science.] The Habilitation originated in 19th-century Germany. The decisive step in an academic career in Germany consists in submitting a Habilitationschrift (a 2nd thesis) superior to the PhD thesis and passing a colloquium with the faculty.
(2) Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend
1961 - Introduction to Cosmology: A Preliminary Reconnaissance. No date, but 1961. It is indicated that supplementary pages were regularly issued (at least for 1961-1962). This was written as MIT course notes for the topic "Ancient Cosmology" within the regular Humanities course (XXI-B). The identification of a Hamlet's Mill manuscript existing in 1961 is most likely the 1961 MIT course notes and add-ons (supplements).
(3) Hertha von Dechend
1966 (but perhaps 1964) - Introduction to Ancient Cosmology. Hertha von Dechend's MIT lecture notes for the 1966 seminar, "Introduction to Ancient Cosmology." If de Santillana and von Dechend had been jointly working on a progressive independent manuscript for Hamlet's Mill then the 1966 MIT course notes would not have had innumerable typing errors, erratic page numbering, and almost complete lack of section headings.
(4) Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend
Circa 1967 - Independent manuscript for commercial publication of Hamlet's Mill is begun by de Santillana. Basic method is editing of 1961 and (mostly) 1966 MIT seminar notes. Von Dechend contributes appendices (mostly) based on 1966 course notes. Hamlet's Mill exists as a salvage effort by de Santillana. The book was supposed to have been written by von Dechend.



It is indicated that at some point after 1961 de Santillana was not constantly involved in what von Dechend was doing at MIT. De Santillana was expecting that von Dechend was preparing a book length manuscript for publication. When he realised that she was not he knew the task would need to be undertaken by him. Von Dechend provided the appendices - largely comprised of the chapter end notes accompanying the text of her seminar notes, so minimal work - but it is not known if they were provided during de Santillana's editing efforts with the 1966 course notes or 'matched' afterwards with the text. Note: Hurriedly editing the abysmally written 1966 lecture notes by von Dechend explains why the result was a clumsy and badly argued book. Interestingly, von Dechend let it remain a clumsy and badly argued book. In her Preface to the 1993 Germanlanguage edition of Hamlet's Mill von Dechend writes that of more than 22 years of intensive work since the 1st appearance of Hamlet's Mill in 1969. However, instead of a renovated and expanded text that she acknowledges would be appropriate she states she was basically limited to additional footnotes and appendices. Why this is so is never explained. We are uncertain whether it was her decision or that of the publisher. Also, it is simply amazing that she has failed to update and publish her studies in peer-reviewed journals. A 2nd volume to the first edition would have been more appropriate.
Note: In building the scope of HM (in a very derivative manner) Santillana/Dechend repeatedly take literary texts out of context, as they do with Virgil's 'messianic' eclogue.6 (see page 244 of HM).
Publication of Hamlet's Mill
The book was not published academically, but commercially. It appears that Hamlet's Mill was rejected by academic publishers. As the book certainly falls below acceptable standards of scholarship this is not surprising. Prior to publication the manuscript was in dire need of some sort of either peer review, or proof treading, or copy editing. This was more because of the book's muddled and disjointed structure and continual habit of moving from the main discussion into side issues. It is not known why this was not done. If it was eventually done then it was not stringent. Since its publication it has been effectively criticised from many perspectives, and it is not a serious scholarly study of mythology. Simply, Hamlet's Mill is unreliable. The publication of the book was only accepted by a small and somewhat obscure/little-known commercial publisher in the Boston area, Gambit Incorporated. It is not known how this was arranged.
"Professor de Santillana worked on editing von Dechend when he was sick and near death, and so this book is not the best expression of their theories. Encyclopedic, but rambling, it is often as chaotic as it is cranky. This weakness, however, should not mislead the reader. The work is very important in seeking to recover the astronomical and cosmological dimensions of mythic narratives." (William Thompson The Time Falling Bodies Take to Light (1981, Pages 268-269).) At the time of completing a manuscript of Hamlet's Mill for publication de Santillana was also completing another book (published in 1968) and he was still lecturing at MIT. His work load during the late 1960s must have been intense. Added to this was the fact that he was ill. This perhaps helps to explain the variations in the narrative, the ebb and flow of the sequence in which the book was ordered, and the generally chaotic character of the book's organization. However, the muddled nature of von Dechend's seminar notes is likely the greater contributor. The use of an informal and loquacious prose style prevailing throughout the book becomes a hindrance. Apart from contributing the appendices it is now impossible to determine exactly what Hertha von Dechend actually contributed anew to the main text. Lost is any careful use and interpretation of linguistics, archaeology, comparative mythology, and astronomy.
Apart from Giorgio de Santillana being seriously ill when he put the manuscript of the book together (his health had began failing quite rapidly) the process of publication itself was apparently a nightmare with material and notes to the publisher becoming lost. In his book The Media Symplex (2004, Page 68) Frank Zingrone states: "Professor de Santillana worked on editing von Dechend when he was sick and near death .... de Santillana ... was furiously working to finish the book before he died. He just barely managed to do that; it was an heroic battle won with the energetic help of his collaborator, Hertha von Dechend." (This simply repeats the information - with a bit added on - given by William Thompson in his book The Time Falling Bodies Take to Light (1996 (1981), Page 268). Also see pages 268-270.) It is also a somewhat fictional account. De Santillana may have been ill but he was not near death - he lived for another 5 years after the book was published. He took on the main task of writing the book because von Dechend was not making any effort to do so. Von Dechend is credited with the preparation of the numerous Appendices but these were likely already existing in some form in her research and seminar notes. After looking through several years of Hertha von Dechend's MIT seminar notes it is painfully obvious there is nothing there in the way of an organised, clear, and connected argument. No clearly defined trail is being blazed by von Dechend.) It is likely that de Santillana died of a tobacco/smoking related disease. (He was a smoker all of his life. The portrait photograph accompanying the obituary by his friend Nathan Sivin in the journal Isis, 1976, shows him holding a cigarette between fingers in his right hand. Other photographs also show him smoking.)
In the Winter-semester 1954-1955 Hertha von Dechend was involved in compiling and editing notes - with Ralph Marcus (University of Chicago) - regarding the Frankfurt-Chicago-Seminar "Östliches und Westliches Denken in der Spät-antike und im Mittelalter." held at the Universität Frankfurt. It would be interesting to see the state of these notes. (It appears these notes were published in 1955.)
Note: There is an erroneous claim (repeated as recently as April 2013 by Susan Rennison) that the more than 10 years of study by de Santillana that led to the publication of Hamlet's Mill held academic risk (due to his unconventional interpretation of ancient mythology) and led to his expulsion from MIT. This is completely fictional - the claimed expulsion from MIT never occurred. (But this illustrates a problem with many commentators on Hamlet's Mill in that they do little effective research, if indeed they do any research at all.)
Publishing history of Hamlet's Mill
Hamlet's Mill: An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time by Giorgio de Santillana (1902-1974) and Hertha von Dechend (1915-2001) was first published in 1969. (The Library of Congress (Copyright Office) Catalog of Copyright Entries has 3 November, 1969, as the copyright date.) The authors presented the book as an exploratory effort in which they present pieces of a puzzle. Hamlet's Mill is a work of speculative scholarship. Much of the text can be described as cryptic/densely obscure. The authors even hint at being intentionally obscure! Certainly the analysis and interpretation by Hertha von Dechend is inventive. Hertha von Dechend spent her life interpreting ancient and medieval myths as a scientific code/shorthand for astronomical events. No university press would publish Hamlet's Mill. According to Colin Wilson the manuscript of Hamlet's Mill was rejected by academic publishers. But where did he apparently obtain this information? He simply doesn't inform us. According to Mark Stahlman the MIT Genius Project was fraught with stories of publishing sabotage of its materials. The idea of publishing sabotage also seems to have become connected with Hamlet's Mill. However, the preparation of it for publication was simply a shambles. (It is mistakenly believed by some persons that there was also a German-language edition published in 1969. Once again, some commentator has not done effective research.) Though the English-language edition has been reprinted four times (i.e., 1970, 1977, 1983, and 1998) the authors never revised or corrected the book. Also, they did not publish any other book on the theme outlined in Hamlet's Mill. Hertha von Dechend incorporated some changes and additions to the German-language edition (Die Mühle des Hamlet) first published in 1993. (This was an authorized translation from the English by Beate Ziegs.) The German edition was 17 pages longer (x, 522 pages (but also indicated as comprising 578 pages)) than the original English edition (x, 505 pages). The German edition of 1993 contains a Preface (v-x) by Hertha von Dechend, Concluding remarks to the German edition (Pages 318-331), and Afterword by the editor (Pages 497-500). This edition contains important information for understanding the process leading to publication of Hamlet's Mill. It would appear that the errata list that was enclosed in this German-language edition was left out of the 1994



reprint of such. (It would appear that this German-language edition was basically a translation of the English-language edition. For a review of the 1993 German-language edition see the (German-language) book review by P[?]. Richter in Sterne und Weltraum, Band 34, 1995, Pages 4-10.) (In Die Mühle des Hamlet (1994) reference is made to a forthcoming book An Introduction to Archaic Cosmology.) An Italian-language edition appeared in 1983. See the (Italian-language) book review of Il Mulino di Amleto (1983) in Il Mulino [published by Società editrice il Mulino], Issues 291-293, 1984, Pages (approx.) 499-512. The Italian-language edition (Il Mulino di Amleto) published in 1983 was apparently simply a translation of the 1969 English-language book. It was reprinted in 1984, and 1998. However, the 1999 Italian-language edition, which was translated/edited by Alessandro Passi, comprised a new and expanded edition (630 pages). This particular edition was reprinted in 2000 and 2003. (The preface to this expanded edition was also written by Hertha von Dechend.) Also, a Hungarian translation (Hamlet malma, translated by Dr Végvári József) was published in 1995. A French-language edition/translation, titled Le Moulin d'Hamlet : la connaissance, origine et transmission par les mythes, was published in 2011 or 2012 (515 pages). It was translated into French by Claude Gaudriault (since 2006 the President of le Groupe Ile de France de Mythologie Française (GIFMF). Note: I have been informed the French edition was published in 2015.
I have yet to check the details regarding El Molino de Hamlet.

The German-language edition of 1993 can be considered the 'definitive' Hamlet's Mill thesis. (According to Richard Flavin, at the time of von Dechend's death in 2001 an English-language translation was still being considered. However, it has never appeared.) the German-language (2nd) edition is not a substantively different volume from the 1969 (1st) edition. No improved research scope is indicated. The contents of the book chapters remain the same as the 1969 English-language edition. Von Dechend considers it a complex book made more difficult by the reader who does not want to understand. (We see here von Dechend's belief that the problem is with everybody else. Some proponents have mimiced this somewhat silly statement as an answer to critics of Hamlet's Mill.) Basically the muddled and confusing text has been allowed to remain despite the need for greater clarity in presentation. The Italian-language edition of 1999 is obviously taken from the 1993 German-language edition.
It is simply incredible that with the 1993 German-language no attempt was made to produce a new text with revised and new arguments and evidence. The 1993 German-language "revision" of the original Hamlet's Mill is substantially the same text as the original 1969 English-language edition! It would seem to indicate that von Dechend - for over 20 years - was not really involved with (or bothered with) substantive improvements to the material developed during the late 1950s and the first half of the 1960s. Von Dechend has not been able to - or bothered with - attempting to advance her arguments. A lot of her material and ideas in the MIT seminar notes were still not utilised. Possibly because to do so would simply weaken her attempt to present a case for her precession-in-myth ideas.
Excursus: Sirio. Tre seminari sulla cosmologia arcaica
Sirio. Tre seminari sulla cosmologia arcaica. Author(s): Giorgio de Santillana, Hertha von Dechend. Editor: S. D'Onofrio. [Series: Piccola biblioteca Adelphi. Publisher: Adelphi, Year: 2020.]
Publishers/Editors Description: Durante la stretta collaborazione che condusse alla stesura del «Mulino di Amleto», Giorgio de Santillana e Hertha von Dechend raccontarono in varie conferenze le scoperte sensazionali che andavano via via facendo. Sepolti in sedi editoriali difficilmente accessibili, i testi di alcuni di quegli interventi sono ora qui raccolti, e consentono al lettore di gettare uno sguardo nell'incomparabile fucina di idee da cui uscirà la loro opera capitale: «l'importanza unica» di Sirio - la più luminosa delle stelle fisse, che per più di 3000 anni sembrò non essere affetta dalla Precessione degli Equinozi - nelle antiche civiltà di tutto il mondo, da Babilonia alla Grecia, dal Medio Oriente iranico all'India, dalla Cina alla Polinesia; il «sistema di misure normate» posto a fondamento della cultura superiore arcaica, dove lunghezza, capacità e peso, strettamente collegati, sono derivati dalle uniche misure «assolute» esistenti in natura: lo scorrere del tempo e gli intervalli armonici; infine, il «mutare delle mode in storiografia», a partire dal caso esemplare del soggiorno di Eudosso in Egitto. In un percorso dalle mille ramificazioni, queste pagine ci offrono una porta d'accesso a quel pensiero arcaico in cui il rigore della Scienza, fondato su numerus, pondus et mensura, parlava ancora il linguaggio tecnico quanto immaginifico del Mito - e contribuiscono a farci rivalutare « quei nostri remotissimi antenati che crearono proprio le civiltà superiori».
Draft translation: During the close collaboration that led to the drafting of the "Hamlet's Mill", Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend recounted the sensational discoveries they were making at various conferences. Buried in difficult-to-access publishing sites, the texts of some of those interventions are now collected here, and allow the reader to glance into the incomparable forge of ideas from which their capital work will emerge: "the unique importance" of Sirius - the brightest of the fixed stars, which for more than 3,000 years seemed not to be affected by the Precession of the Equinoxes - in ancient civilizations around the world, from Babylon to Greece, from the Iranian Middle East to India, from China to Polynesia; the "system of normed measures" placed at the foundation of the archaic higher culture, where length, capacity and weight, closely linked, are derived from the only "absolute" measures existing in nature: the passage of time and harmonic intervals; finally, the "changing of fashions in historiography", starting from the exemplary case of Eudoxus' stay in Egypt. In a path with a thousand ramifications, these pages



offer us a gateway to that archaic thought in which the rigor of Science, based on numerus, pondus et mensura, still spoke the technical and imaginative language of the Myth - and help us to re-evaluate "Those very remote ancestors of ours who created the superior civilizations.".
Critical book reviews of Hamlet's Mill
It appears that - at least initially - Hamlet's Mill lacked wide distribution amongst scholars (and the general public). Present-day claims by particular devotees that its publication started a firestorm of controversy are over-exaggeration.
Some of the critical (English-language) book reviews of Hamlet's Mill are by Edmund Leach in The New York Review (of Books), February 12, 1970, Page 36, (Giorgio's De Santillana's protest letter regarding this review appeared in "Letters," The New York Review, May 7, 1970); by Jaan Puhvel in The American Historical Review, Volume LXXV, Number 6, October, 1970, Pages 2009-2010; by Lynn White Junior in Isis, Volume 61, 1970, Pages 540-541; by Geoffrey Kirk in The Spectator , Number 7434, 19 December, 1970, Page 809; by Gerald Gresseth in Journal of American Folklore, Volume 84, Number 332, April/June, 1971, Pages 246-247; by Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin in Journal for the History of Astronomy, Volume 3, 1972, Pages 206-211; by Albert Friedman in Journal of the History of Philosophy, Volume X, 1972, Page 479; by Hilda Davidson in Folklore, Volume CXXXV, 1974, Pages 282-283; by David Leeming in Parabola, Volume III, Issue 1, 1978, Pages 113-115; and the (German-language) book review by Thomas Barthel in Zeitschrift für Ethnologie, Band 99, Heft 1 und 2, 1974, Pages 284-287). (I have not yet seen the French-language book review of Hamlet's Mill in Revue de l'histoire des religions, Volume 180, 1971, Page 216.)
Rhetorical style of Hamlet's Mill
Hamlet's Mill is highly reliant on rhetoric (= persuasive discourse).
In his book, Ideas of Ascension and Translation: A Study of the Literary and Cultural Mythological Tradition of the West (2004), Peter Sorensen recognizes the rhetorical style of Hamlet’s Mill and writes (page 225): "The New Age rhetorical style is markedly different from the very concrete rhetoric of the literalists [that deal with a material or tangible object or phenomenon], such as Velikovsky [Oedipus and Akhnaton], Sitchin [The Wars of Gods and Men], and de Santillana [Hamlet’s Mill]."
The rhetorical style shows in von Dechend's MIT seminar notes for participants.
Despite the rhetoric of evidence their claims are not plausible. Expert advice should have been sought in the areas for which they were not competent.
Use of sources
It has been pointed out that the authors often do not distinguish between between primary and secondary sources. Also, they often do not differentiate between attested early traditions and later ones. A lot of the book actually deals with medieval material (i.e., the Scandinavian, Persian and Indian material). But there is an archaization frenzy in their intent. Neither de Santillana or von Dechend were medievalists and this obviously shows with the difficulties they get into.
Source: Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend by John McKinnell (2005; Pages 1-3).
The authors do not explicitly connect the myths to a chronological scheme but rather the myths (or at least the themes) are deemed archaic and constructed as an astronomical technical language. The contents of the book do not prove these claims.
In Hamlet's Mill the authors initially (first 7 chapters) seek to establish the framework of their claims by using predominantly medieval works. According to the authors of Hamlet's Mill (Page 51): "The last forms - or rehearsals - of a true myth took place in medieval culture: the Romance of Alexander, and the Arthurian myth as it is found in Malory."

Gesta Danorum (Deeds [Story] of the Danes)
Denmark (Scandinavia)
12thcentury
The 9 books of the Gesta Danorum by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus are an essential source for the nation's early history. However, there are important critical issues. The best known are Books 3 and 4 containing the story of (the Scandinavian) Amleth (Old Icelandic form Amlóði/Amlodi). Amleth or Amlóði (Norse for "mad," "not sane"). The Gesta Danorum is comprised of narratives about kings, maidens, and trolls in a manner similar to a folk-tale - it is not history. The material comprising the Gesta Danorum has to be handled with caution/care when extracting the mythological material.
Kalevala Finland
(Scandinavia)
19thcentury
The Kalevala (or The Kalewala) is a 19th-century work of epic poetry compiled by the Finnish philologist Elias Lönnrot from Karelian and Finnish oral folklore, songs, and mythology. The Kalevala recounts the adventures of Väinämöinen (WÄinÄmöinen), the bard/sorcerer; Ilmarenan the magical blacksmith/craftsman; Lemminkäinen (or Lemminki) the rogue; and a number of other characters. The Sampo is a pivotal element of the plot of The Kalevala. (In mythology, the great king of Kainuu in Finnish, Karelian and Estonian mythology. Also, Kaleva is an obscure giant in Finnish mythology.) Particularly popular for many readers was the hero character, WÄinÄmöinen a powerful sorcerer who was able to transform the treeless land into a vast paradise, as well as warming the Sun, clearing pestilence, and performing a variety of magical acts. (The Finns tell in their Kalevala that the support of the sky gave way and then a spark of fire kindled a new sun and a new moon.}
Edda Iceland 13thcentury
Edda is an Old Norse term given by modern scholars to the collective of 2 medieval Icelandic literary works now known as the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda. The 2 13th-century books are commonly distinguished as the Prose, or Younger, Edda and the Poetic, or Elder, Edda. Edda is the fullest and most detailed source for modern knowledge of Germanic mythology. The Prose Edda was written by the Icelandic chieftain, poet, and historian Snorri Sturluson, probably in 1222–1223 CE. It is a textbook on poetics intended to instruct young poets in the difficult metres of the early Icelandic skalds (court poets) and to provide for a Christian age an understanding of the mythological subjects treated or alluded to in early poetry. The Poetic Edda comprises the oral literature of Iceland, which was finally written down from 1000 CE to 1300 CE. The Poetic Edda is a later manuscript finally dating from the second half of the 13th century, but containing older materials (hence its alternative title, the Elder Edda). It is a collection of mythological and heroic poems of unknown authorship, composed over a long period (perhaps 800–1100 CE). Some scholars believe that the poems in the Poetic Edda possibly only date to



circa the 10th-century CE (pre-Christian Scandinavia). There is no suitable means to date the poems in the Poetic Edda.
Skaldskaparmal Iceland 13th
century
The 2nd part of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda the Skáldskaparmál is effectively a dialogue between Ægir, the Norse god of the sea, and Bragi, the Norse god of poetry, in which both Norse mythology and discourse on the nature of poetry are intertwined. Past discussion of the sources of Skáldskaparmál has mainly been concerned with 2 related issues. Firstly, the accuracy with which Snorri reproduces preChristian tradition in his work, and thus his reliability as a writer on that tradition. Secondly the extent to which his work is influenced by the Christian, Latin thought of the Middle Ages. With regard to the first issue: There has been speculation about the possibility that Snorri or people of his circle may actually have invented myths as well as altering or modifying those they inherited from the past. With regard to the second issue: The only material that seems to have its origin in foreign (and originally Latin) writing is the references to the Troy story in the so-called Epilogus.
Vaftbrudnismal (Vafþrúðnir's sayings)
Iceland
11th to 13thcentury
Old Norse Vafþrúðnismál = "the lay of Vafþrúðnir" (Vafþrúðnir's sayings) is the 3rd poem (book) in the Poetic Edda. It is a conversation in verse form conducted initially between the Æsir Odin and Frigg, and subsequently between Odin and the giant Vafþrúðnir. Odin journeys to the home of the giant Vafþrúðnir and plays a question-and-answer game there that reveals details about the creation of the Norse cosmos.
Lokasenna
(Loki's flyting) Iceland
11th to 13thcentury
Lokasenna ("Loki's flyting," "Loki's wrangling," "Loki's quarrel") is one of the poems of the Poetic Edda. The poem presents flyting (a contest consisting of the exchange of insults, often conducted in verse, between two parties) between the gods and Loki.
Gylfaginning (Tricking of Gylfi)
Iceland
11th to 13thcentury
Gylfaginning is the first part of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda after Prologue. The Gylfaginning deals with the creation and destruction of the world of the Norse gods, and many other aspects of Norse mythology. The Gylfaginning contains a question-and-answer game in which Gylfi's questions reveal the nature of the Norse cosmos. Gylfaginning reflects Christian motifs, especially from the Old Testament.
Shahnama
(Book of Kings) Persia
Late 10thand early 11thcentury
The Shahnama (Shahnameh) is a long epic poem written over several decades by the Persian poet Ferdowsi of Tus, (near the city of Mashhad in northeastern Iran) (Abul-Qasim Firdawsi/Abu'l Qasim Firdausi) between circa 977 CE and 1010 CE and is the national epic of Greater Iran. The Shahnama is a celebration of Iran's pre-Islamic past. (Very little is known about the poet Abul-Qasim Firdawsi, not even his real name. Since Firdawsi means "paradisal," this must have been his poetic or pen name.)
Mahabharata (Great Epic of the Bharata Dynasty)
India
Late 4thcentury BCE to early 4thcentury CE
The Mahabharata (Mahābhārata) (composed between 300 BCE and 300 CE) is one of the 2 major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the Ramayana. The Mahabharata is an epic narrative of the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the Kaurava and the Pandava princes (2 sets of paternal first cousins).
Conversations with Ogotemmêli
Sudan (Africa)
Mid 20thcentury
Now discredited book by the late French anthropologist Marcel Griaule. Originally published in 1948 as Dieu d'Eau, it supposedly offered a unique and first-hand account of the myth, religion, and philosophy of the Dogon, a Sudanese people.
It is not shown that these late sources (in the table above) were intended to contain traces of an astronomical system dating from the Neolithic period. The Mahabharata (Mahābhārata), the single early epic poem, contains descriptive astronomical material. However, it is worth noting that attempting to date the Mahabharata based on the precession of the equinoxes provides no definitive date and has the problem of needing to accept an early established zodiacal system. Some Indians claim that the war described in the Mahabharata took place in 3139 BCE. This is based on the length of the Four Ages given in the Puranas, a type of mythohistorical literature dating from the 1st-millennium CE. The doctrine of Four Ages is somewhat more ancient, appearing also in earlier Greek and Germanic mythology, but their quantification/measurement is apparently linked/mixed with the precession of the equinoxes, Precession was discovered by Hipparchus circa 150 BCE and introduced in India only in subsequent centuries. The zodiac of 12 equal divisions was established by the Babylonians circa 450 BCE (but more likely circa 425 BCE). There are no pre-Hellenistic mentions of the fourth age starting in the 32nd-century BCE, 37 years after the Mahabharata war, as Hindus traditionally (i.e. based on the Puranas) believe. The astronomical evidence of the Mahabharata itself, however, points to well after 2300 BCE.
Both Snorri and Saxo attempted to preserve and systematise the myths and narratives of Old Norse religions. They differ in their approaches. (Interestingly, Saxo, working from material in Danish libraries, was also influenced by French sources regarding the history of kings. Literature/story themes, were also shared (migrated) between countries/nations during the medieval period.) Their efforts were carried out at a time when the Old Norse religions were becoming forgotten. Denmark and Sweden converted to Christianity circa 1000 CE Norway converted to Christianity circa 1200 CE. Snorri Sturluson mixed Christian theology with narratives about the origin of the Old Norse gods/goddesses. Snorri also mixed Norse myths with certain Christian motifs. Some scholars as early as the early 19th-century suggested that most of the stories in the Edda were Snorri's own inventions. That is, some scholars have suggested that some poems could be literary, written products from the 11thcentury CE (circa the same period as the manuscript was produced). However, this view is no longer held by the majority of scholars. It is now recognised (dominating opinion) that the most detailed sources for pre-Christian Scandinavian mythology are the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda, the latter being an anonymous collection of Icelandic mythological poems. That is, it is largely agreed the poems are originally oral and a versified version of Old Norse myth. Apart from Runic inscriptions there is a paucity of written evidence for early Scandinavian and medieval history. The oldest surviving historical text in Old Norse is Íslendingabók by an Icelandic priest, Ari Þorgilsson, working in the early 12th-century. (Íslendingabók is a historical work dealing with early Icelandic history.) The earliest histories began to be completed in the 12th-century CE. Interestingly, Christian Etheridge (2012) writes: "By the thirteenth century astronomical works from Europe had completely superceded (sic) indigenous Scandinavian astronomical traditions."
Regarding Icelandic medieval sagas. The adventures of Grettir (an Icelandic outlaw) - told in The Saga of Grettir, one of the last great medieval Icelandic sagas - would be difficult to relate to the planets. The authors of Hamlet's Mill ignore it. Interestingly, the Grettis saga is teeming with allusions to mythological figures.
Using obscure/difficult literary texts as sources of history



Steve Mc Cluskey made the point (Hastro-L, circa 2000): “it seems that historians insist that an interpretation of a text must be supported by the text itself and by other evidence of how the author actually intended the text to be read.” The question then arises is: how far can literary texts be used as primary sources and what techniques can we use to interpret them in this way?
Gisli Sigurðsson's 2014 interpretation of Snorri's Edda
Sigurðsson, Gisli. (2014). "Snorri's Edda: The Sky Described in Mythological Terms." In: Tangherlini, Timothy. (Editor). Nordic Mythologies: Interpretations, Intersections, and Institutions. (Pages 184-198). The authors theme indicates that he is influenced by Hamlet's Mill, but apparently he does not advocate precessional mythology. Abstract: "Mythologies from around the world all have an astronomical aspect to them in the sense that they reflect detailed knowledge and observation of the sky above. All over the world people have used mythological language to talk about and share astronomical knowledge among the learned elites of all cultures; knowledge about the movements of the sun, the moon and the planets within the ever revolving firmament around the fixed points in the extreme north and south. It can be demonstrated, from celestial observations in 19th century Icelandic tradition, that certain ideas in Old Norse mythology referred directly to peculiar celestial phenomena. In view of that actual proof it should be worth discussing the possibility of taking that idea a step further and read the entire Snorri's Edda as a mythological interpretation of the world as it appears to the naked eye: The earth below and the sky above where the stars and other heavenly bodies move around, as well as up and down, some in a clearly regular pattern and others less so, day and night. This approach changes radically all our discussion about systematic thought behind the individual myths as well as about their source value as reflections of pre-Christian ideas in the north. In my paper I shall read Gylfaginning (Gylfi's Illusion) as a general introduction to what can literally be observed in the sky where, as Snorri tells us 82 times, we should be looking for the gods. Gylfi's illusion in the frame-story is therefore to think that he is observing what he is being told about the gods and their dwellings and the world tree in the sky when, in fact, all he sees with his mortal eyes is the stars, the planets, the Sun and the Moon, and the Milky way; with occasional celestial phenomena such as the rainbow, sun-/moon haloes and eclypses (sic), all of which have their mythological equivalent and "can be seen from Earth" as Gylfaginning (ch. 11) puts it when explaining the children Bil and Hiuki, well known as moon-dogs in English." Gísli Sigurðsson is with the University of Iceland. Comments: Needs to be used with caution. The opening speculative paragraph and speculative/erroneous parts of the contents show the influence of Hamlet's Mill. Argues that the mythology of Snorra Edda (Snorri's Edda) is built on an old tradition and should not be read as a learned construction from the time of Snorri Sturluson.
The idea of cultural elites as the means for the acceptance and dissemination of the mono-myth has many problems. (It is still used to explain the transmission of astral sciences in the 1st-century BCE.) If there is nothing in their state of civilization/culture which responds to the ideas it contains then there is no cultural basis for the mono-myth to be accepted and take hold. If accepted and the details within the mono-myth are strange then these can be expected to be changed. In the case of Hamlet's Mill the mono-myth would be modifiable. Imported/disseminated stories are subject to adaption.

Hamlet's Mill as a 'package' for the different motives of its authors
Von Dechend and de Santillana were not reasoning machines or purely cerebral academics. The were products of their time and cultures and with agendas.
Some persons mistakenly offer that Hamlet's Mill jointly expresses the independent discoveries of astronomical mythology by the authors. It is clear that both Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend had different motives for their approach and claims. The wider vision was held by Giorgio de Santillana who wanted to establish the earliest possible date for the origins of science and human genius/intelligence. (He most likely believed the book was an exploration of archaic consciousness.) It seems Hertha von Dechend merely wanted to reassert and expand the ideas of Leo Frobenius (and Panbabylonism). (She was very much a disciple of Frobenius.) De Santillana was susceptible to, and reliant on, the enormous work done by von Dechend - who proved herself capable of only working obscurely. Ultimately, Hamlet's Mill is a testament to their willingness to use incomprehensible speculation as a method to reach their respective aims.
Ernest McClain (1918-2014) posted to Bibal (Bibal Study Group) (December 6, 2006): "The problem with von Dechend is NOT with her general thesis, but rather with her own lack of ANY interest in the quantitative science that deSantillano (sic) outlines brilliantly in his introduction to what is really "her" book. She possessed none of the skills with the Pythagorean "quadrivium" (music, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy) that you demonstrate so well. But she was right in feeling that things had to be interconnected better than our fractured disciplines illustrate, and she undoubtedly influenced many young readers. She and I found each other totally impossible. I had done most of my work on Greek science and mythology before reading her book, but there was no way of explaining to her the meaning of her own "hour glass" Holy Mountain. Our confrontation at an M.I.T. seminar and again later in Boston was fruitless. Very few people are able to "read me" with your kind of total insight. I can almost count them on one hand (as Marius Schneider warned me would happen before I published my first book [The Myth of Invariance (1978)]), having glanced at my first graphics for M.O.I. Not many people are ready to think "in this mode," although it has much in common with many branches of science ...."
In his talk "Time in Literature." Enrico Palandri (University College London) stated: "The scholar Giorgio De Santillana is a solitary modern thinker to have felt a great fascination for the epoch before the word. Unlike our common, rather self content perception of the pre-historic time as a barbaric and undeveloped age, he thought of that original age as an epoch of mysterious greatness. In his opinion, these ancestors of ours must have had some formidable ability in mathematical calculus: we inherit from them the observation of the movement of stars, the Zodiac [de Santillana wrongly believed the zodiac was developed during the Neolithic period], and in his opinion also a network of common features which is a substratum of several mythologies of the Historic period. In his book Hamlet’s mill (Il mulino di Amleto) he suggests that there may have been a link between several cultural similarities in worlds that our conception of the prehistoric age as "undeveloped" epoch would not explain. The idea of Indo-European language is related to this pre-written epoch. We imagine our language to have developed from a previous substratum of a language no longer existing." De Santillana - for reasons he never adequately explained/defended - ignored the cuneiform evidence for a late invention of the zodiac. Of course, the whole edifice of Hamlet's Mill rests on the supposition of a very early zodiac.
Both Hertha von Dechend and Giorgio de Santillana were too easily seduced by the illusionary scholarship of the Panbabylonists. Unfortunately Hamlet's Mill still remains a book to mislead incautious readers for decades to come. Some readers are eager to be misled. One enthusiastic supporter of the book writes in his review (2008): "A simultaneously wonderful, annoying, fascinating and baffling book. Cited by many ... as a flawed ... condemned by many more as a woefully muddled throwback to late 19th century "Panbabylonism", its very nature as a bold, disputed, unclassifiable mess endears it to me." My only comment on this type of uninformed nonsense is the Panbabylonian ideas Hamlet's Mill is based on



originated in the early 20th-century - not the late 19th century. But supporters of Hamlet's Mill seem unaffected by matters of accuracy, or the need to do some genuine research.
After the death of Giorgio de Santillana a staff member of Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität, Professor Dr Walter Saltzer, became a colleague of Hertha von Dechend. In 1979 at IGN Walter Saltzer was Professor of Arabic Science. Walter Saltzer's key area of interest is the genesis and development of scientific ideas. He believes the period of the Pre-Socratic's and the period comprising the 17th-century happens to be the periods of decisive scientific progress. Saltzer is the deputy-director of the Institute for the History of Science. (He is perhaps also a member of the History of Science Society an international group which was established in the early 1970's.) See his slim book Theorien und Ansatze in der Griechischen Astronomie - im Kontext benachbarter Wissenschaften betrachtet [Theories and Approaches in Greek Astronomy - in the Context of Neighboring Sciences] (1976, Pages viii, 162, Figures 38). Also, the book reviews in Journal for the History of Astronomy, Volume 9, 1978, Pages 149-150; and Erasmus, Volume 31, 1979, Pages 374-377.

Excursus: William Thompson noted that during his time at MIT there was great attention being given to the development of computer science. MIT academics were involved with computer development and innovation. As example: In 1963 MIT PhD student Ivan Sutherland developed a graphical user interface computer screen. In 1965 MIT Lincoln Laboratory researchers helped to create minicomputers. In 1967 Richard Greenblatt at MIT built a knowledge-based chess-playing computer. Walter McCulloch, Walter Pitts, both close friends of de Santillana, and Oliver Selfridge at MIT made pioneering contributions to computer science and artificial intelligence. McCulloch, Pitts, and Wiener (sometimes misspelled Weiner) all influenced ideas of computer intelligence. The influence of artificial intelligence on de Santillana's ideas has not been explored. It is unknown whether de Santillana's interest in the nature of genius and discovery was influenced by Norbert Wiener's investigations circa 1955 onwards. Note: Copies of letters by Norbert Wiener to Giorgio de Santillana are in the Norbert Wiener Papers archive (at least Box 4), Institute Archives and Special Collections, MIT Libraries.
Norbert Wiener, after being forced out of the field of Cybernetics (which was term that Wiener had coined in 1946) when he started to raise uncomfortable questions about the social/cultural implications of digital computing, subsequently organised what he termed his "Genius Project." Norbert Wiener and his closest associates, including Giorgio de Santillana and Karl Deutsch, withdrew from Cybernetics and established at MIT what Wiener called his "Genius Project": in the hopes of recording the influences of historic geniuses on human history. (Note: Karl Deutsch (1912-1992) was born in Prague and immigrated to the USA in the late 1930s. He taught at the MIT, Yale, and Harvard. Deutsch was a social and political scientist whose work focused on the study of war and peace, nationalism, co-operation and communication. He was considered a master of cross disciplinary research.)
Assessing Hamlet's Mill
For the authors of Hamlet's Mill astral mythology is the universal cipher to unlock all myths.
Hamlet's Mill has received, and continues to receive, an enormous amount of uncritical support despite the fact that it presents an obscure and confusingly argued case. It is flawed speculative scholarship. It has been described as "tortuous and occasionally baffling." It is highly speculative, its arguments are based on little evidence, and there is little substantiation of its arguments. The contents of the book are poorly organised and presented. The book contains an immense amount of loosely related information but there is no persuasive evidence presented for the connections being made. The case being made is attempted with dis-jointed and piece-meal arguments. There is no reason to believe that much of the evidence cited in the book has actual relevance to the claims being made. (As the fruit of a long collaboration between the authors the book is an academic mess.) A glaringly obvious defect is that both authors lack an expert knowledge of the history of Babylonian astronomy. (They chose to use early and unreliable sources from the pioneering stage of recovery of Babylonian astral sciences.) Indeed, their combined lack of knowledge of astronomy, philology, history, and mythology have resulted in fantastical conclusions. Remarkably, though the central theme relies on the establishment of a very early zodiac any attempt to establish evidence for such is ignored by the authors. A troublesome feature of the book is that its authors have neglected the obvious precaution of learning some elementary astronomy. The authors should have asked when the zodiac was first devised. The answer would have conclusively pointed to a maximum antiquity in the 1st-millennium BCE. However, the authors did not ask and answer the question and have cheerfully wandered many thousands of years beyond this period. The authors simply write their book on the assumption that an early zodiac and precessional mythology both existed.
Efforts to ensure consistency and clarity with the exposition of its ideas needed to be implemented. A chronological overview from the beginning of the historic period to the medieval period (with primary sources) would have been helpful for clarity. An overview of mythic themes and inclusion of sources would also have been helpful for clarity.
Mythical origins of Hamlet's Mill
According to the version by de Santillana in the Preface to the 1st edition of Hamlet's Mill there are 2 key points for von Dechend's development of her ideas. See Page vii (Preface) where de Santillana briefly describes von Dechend's acceptance of the ethnographic work with the Dogon that was being reported by Marcel Griaule [and later to be discredited]; and then her Polynesian "epiphany."
The origins of the theme and ideas in Hamlet's Mill have never been clearly explained by either author. According to Hertha von Dechend the astronomical interpretation of mythology was made clear during her work on Polynesian mythology. However, apart from a slight mention of this in Hamlet's Mill no further discussion ever occurred. Stranger still, because it was also stated to be a turning point for de Santillana. In Hamlet’s Mill (Page vii) Hertha von Dechend claimed her understanding of the astronomical content of Polynesian myth was established "when, on looking (on a map) at two little islands, mere flyspecks on the waters of the Pacific, she found that a strange accumulation of maraes or cult places could be explained only one way: they, and only they, were exactly sited on two neat celestial coordinates: the Tropics of Cancer and of Capricorn." Any attempt at alternative explanation is not discussed - it appears that her astronomical conclusion comprises the evidence. There is no evidence drawn from ethnographic fieldwork conducted by herself. Even after WWII no "on-the-spot" fieldwork/research in the Pacific region was conducted by von Dechend. (Though the "epiphany account" is written by de Santillana he is wholly reliant on von Dechend for the story.) The epiphany episode is not dated by von Dechend but it can, at earliest, only date to the 1940s or 1950s. (It is indicated as related to her Habilitation which was undertaken in the late 1950s.) Why the date is not given is never explained. The date would establish when von Dechend began her astronomical interpretation of mythology. There is enough literature for wider possibilities to be considered. Also, de Santillana is not being accurate when he writes that the 2 islands, meaning Necker and Tubuai, are exactly sited on the Tropics of Cancer and of Capricorn, respectively. The position of the Tropic of Cancer is not fixed, but varies in a complex manner (connected with precession) over time. Presently, Necker Island lies almost exactly on the Tropic of Cancer. Some 1000 years ago the island was precisely on the Tropic. Necker is presently 8 miles (7 nautical miles; 13 kilometres) from the Tropic of Cancer. Its traditional name in Hawaiian is Moku-manamana, which has been taken by some to mean "the



island with a great deal of sacred power." However, more than one translation is possible and the name may simply have meant "branching island." Likewise, Tubai Island lies close to the Tropic of Capricorn.
Note: Von Dechend sent de Santillana a summary of her ideas on precessional mythology in 1959. This indicates that she was working on her ideas in the 1950s at least. A likely starting point is indicated as being the work on her Habilitation (completed 1960 but not known when started). The subject of the Habilitation thesis included Tane / Kane in Polynesia. Tane (the Hawaiian counterpart of Tane was Kane, the supreme god) was a sky/nature/sun god (god of creation and god of light) in Polynesia (especially eastern Polynesia. Tane was one of the most popular and widely worshipped gods. According to von Dechend the 2nd chapter dealing with the Polynesian Tane / Kane created discomfort. Von Dechend felt she had not understood a word she had read from the more than 10,000 pages of Polynesian myths. The puzzle her for von Dechend was: Could it be assumed that the first-born "initiates" among the best navigators on the globe had to memorize a conglomerate of purely entertaining stories? Her Habilitation (completed in 1960) was Der Mythos von gebauten Welt als Ausdrucksform archaischer Naturwissenschaft. ("The myth of the built world as an expression of archaic science.") Her "epiphany" is indicated as being prior to her to her Habilitation being completed and prior meeting with de Santillana in 1959 (a starting point for her astronomical interpretations beginning between 1956 and 1958 is indicated). Her work at MIT was obviously an extension/expansion of her Habilitation. Her work on Hamlet's Mill seems only to have begun in 1960 (with the completion of her Habilitation that year), prior to her first visit to MIT in 1961 as a research associate. She needed suitable and sufficient material for the student seminars to be held at MIT (in conjunction with de Santillana). Also indicated is her main interpretations of myths was concluded by 1961 latest; beginning earliest between 1956 and 1958.
There are various types of maraes. Basically a marae is an open-air sacred place comprising a paved court, (sometimes) a low-walled enclosure, and a raised platform (ahu) across one end, which served both religious and social purposes in pre-Christian Polynesian societies. The most comprehensive archaeological research on Nihoa(/Nihua) Island and Necker Island was conducted in 1923-1924 by Kenneth Emory of the Bishop Museum. In 1928 he published Archaeology of Nihoa and Necker Islands. It remains the baseline of our present-day knowledge regarding the archaeology and technology of Nihoa(/Nihua) and Necker. (Emory is considered to have perhaps overstated marae similarities to those in the Society Islands.) Robert Aitken, Research Associate in Ethnology, spent 2 years in the Austral Islands, principally on Tubuai, as a member of the Bayard Dominick Expedition of the Bishop Museum, 1920-1922. His preliminary report appeared in the Annual Report for 1922 of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum. His full report, Ethnology of Tubuai, appeared in 1930. Some persons see von Dechend's described 'event' as the impetus for her 'intellectual journey.' The description is devoid of suitable context i.e., the discussion of work previously done by others. The story is not believable as the impetus for her 'intellectual journey.' It is, however, believable for illustrating her methods - or lack of such. (This model is one that others seem bent on imitating.) Hertha von Dechend's teacher Leo Frobenius had, from the early 1900s, published Panbabylonian ideas and claimed correspondence between mythological themes and celestial phenomena, world-wide. Essentially, von Dechend carried on the work of her teacher Leo Frobenius. At Frankfurt she was certainly carrying on the work of Frobenius.
Note: in the 1993 German-language edition of Hamlet's Mill Hertha von Dechend revisits the 'epiphany episode' in considerable detail. She states she consulted archaeological reports, including the 1928 report by Kenneth Emory. What is strikingly peculiar is there is no further mention of these 2 obviously important sites in the book. Von Dechend did not have the benefit of several later publications. At best only the early work of Emory (Archaeology of Nihoa and Necker Islands (1928)), but this particular work in not cited. A later (1947) publication by Emory appears in the bibliography of the original edition of Hamlet's Mill.
Crescent-shaped Necker Island (Mokumanamana) is a narrow ridge of volcanic rock rising only a few hundred feet (approximately 65 metres) above sea level. The island's rugged volcanic terrain is described as a dangerous place to walk around because the 15 million-year-old volcanic rock crumbles easily with the weight of feet or hands.
Few signs of long-term human habitation have been found. The work of the esteemed archaeologist Patrick Kirch (1897-1992) suggested the likelihood that Necker Island was occupied for a single generation; perhaps by canoe castaways with the survivors trapped. See Feather Gods and Fishhooks by Patrick Kirch (1985, Pages 89-98); and "Polynesian Mystery Islands." by Patrick Kirch (Archaeology, Volume 44, 1988, Pages 2631). However, the island contains 33 stone shrines and stone artifacts much like those found in the main Hawaiian Islands. Because of this, many anthropologists believe that the island was a ceremonial and religious site. More recently, in 2015, at the Hawaiian Historical Society's October membership meeting, Hawaiian studies professor Kekuewa Kikiloi presented a talk on his research into the 2 remote islands of Nihoa and Necker. (Presentation, title "Islands of My Ancestors: Unravelling the Mystery of Nihoa and Necker Islands.") Kikiloi, assistant professor in the Kamakakūokalani Center for Hawaiian Studies at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, challenged the notion that these island settlements were cultural anomalies and presented a case that both played an important and central function in traditional Hawaiian Society. Kikilois research covers Hawaiian resource management, indigenous knowledge, traditional society, genealogies, cultural revitalization, and community empowerment and spans the main Hawaiian Islands, the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, and greater Polynesia. In 2012 Kikiloi received his Ph.D. in anthropology at Mānoa. His doctoral dissertation consisted of an ethno-historical and archaeological study of Mokumanamana and Nihoa Islands. These 2 barren islands (mostly Nihoa) contain more than 140 archaeological sites, including residential features, agricultural terraces, ceremonial structures, shelters, cairns, and burials. From his research, Kikiloi concluded that for more than 400 years, from about 1400 to 1815, chiefly elites established Necker Island as a ritual center of power for the Hawaiian system of heiau (temples). (Also, aspects of Hawaiian mythology originated with physical and astronomical aspects of this region.) These efforts had implications that led to the centralization of chiefly management, integration of chiefs and priests into a single social class, and ultimately a state-sponsored religion that became widely established throughout the main Hawaiian Islands.
Kikiloi, Kekuewa. (2012). Kūkulu Manamana: Ritual Power and Religious Expansion in Hawai'i. [Note: 2012 doctoral dissertation, downloadable from: https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/101211/1/Kikiloi_Scott_r.pdf]
Mokumanamana (Necker Island) is known for its numerous wahi pana (religious places) and mea makamae (cultural objects). Fifty-five cultural places are known, of which 33 are religious, 17 are shelter caves, and 2 sites are of unknown function. These cultural sites are thought to date primarily before the habitation sites on Nihoa Island were abandoned in the 18th-century. Because the island is small, dry, and has little soil suitable for agriculture, Hawaiians probably traveled to Mokumanamana from Nihoa and other Hawaiian Islands primarily for religious purposes. In 1786, Compte de La Pérouse, a French explorer, visited Mokumanamana and named it "Necker Island" after Jacques Necker, the finance minister under Louis XVI. Since then its Hawaiian name has been restored. In 1857, the Hawaiian king Kamehameha IV sent Captain John Paty to claim Mokumanamana for the Kingdom of Hawai'i. His claim was contested by France until 1894, when the island was annexed by Hawai'i's Provisional Government.
It is not known who the inhabitants of Necker Island were. The Bishop Museum expedition in the 1920's estimated that Nihoa Island could hold about 100 people there, but resources like fresh water must have been really limited. Both Necker Island and Nihoa Island were full of relatively undisturbed sites, encampments, and temples. Kekuewa Kikiloi has posited the view that the islanders on Necker and Nihoa were very much part of the rest of Hawaiian society. Kikiloi believes they traveled frequently to Kauai and the main islands as a means for survival.



A considerable number of her basic claims are borrowed from the Panbabylonian 'classic' Das Alte Testament im Lichte des Alten Orients (2 volumes) by Alfred Jeremias. The 3rd revised edition appeared in 1916. Hertha von Dechend merely wanted to reassert and expand the ideas of Leo Frobenius (and Panbabylonism). (Von Dechend studied Cultural and Historical Anthropology at the Frobenius Institute and Museum of Ethnology.) The story told by von Dechend in Hamlet's Mill does illustrate the shallowness and limitations of her research methods. She never engaged in a critical discussion/assessment of all the evidentiary issues but was simply persuaded by her initial 'snap' decision. She never revisited this decision, or introduced the ideas of other researchers. Though Hertha von Dechend does not name the two islands they are identifiable as Necker and Tubuai. The Tropic of Cancer presently passes just south of Necker. Tubuai presently lies just inside the Tropic of Capricorn (i.e., the Tropic of Capricorn currently lies just south of Tubuai). The Tropic of Cancer is a line of latitude approximately 23 degrees to the north of the equator. The Tropic of Capricorn is a line of latitude approximately 23 degrees to the south of the equator.
Excursus: The astronomical explanation of Polynesian mythology remains controversial and uncertain
The astronomical explanation of Polynesian mythology remains controversial and uncertain. The astronomical explanation to account for the high numbers of temple platforms on Necker and Tubuai is also controversial. It involves the suggestion that the Polynesians had a keen interest in the passage of the sun through the zenith. The Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn establish the limits for the sun passing through the zenith (at noon). At any location inside the tropical points the sun passes through the zenith on two different days in the year. The actual dates are dependent upon the latitude. The Tropic of Cancer marks the most northerly latitude at which the sun can appear directly overhead (the zenith) at noon. The Tropic of Capricorn marks the most southerly latitude at which the sun can appear directly overhead (the zenith) at noon. At a location on the Tropic of Cancer, or the Tropic of Capricorn the sun passes directly overhead on only one day a year. This is the June solstice only for the Tropic of Cancer and the December solstice only for the Tropic of Capricorn. Necker, a small (estimated 26 hectare = 46 acre = 1/6 square kilometre, in size) barren northwestern Hawaiian island, was once inhabited. It was the furthermost island within easy reach of the main Hawaiian group. Necker and Nihoa(/Nihua) are the two main islands closest to the main Hawaiian Islands. The dense grouping of maraes on Necker Island is not found in Hawaii but is found in the Society Islands. The large number of maraes (33), constructed at different times, suggest that the occupation of the island was not a one time stop over by a fleet of voyaging canoes. The uniformity of the archaeological remains on Necker Island suggest that the island was inhabited for only a limited number of years. It is possible that drought was involved in their abandonment. However, maraes were used as ceremonial sites not dwelling sites. With no trees, 8 or 9 rock shelters, and limited water, it may have been a temporary occupation site, which was repeatedly visited. These northwestern islands were the base for hunting excursions for turtles and seabirds. Nihoa(/Nihua) is home to a tremendous amount of birds and lots of marine life, including seals and turtles. Necker had 33(/34) temple platforms almost identical to those found in Polynesian islands to the southeast. The temple platforms were erected by inhabitants who lived on the island in the 14th-century CE, or perhaps earlier (circa 1000 CE). Oral traditions and archaeological data attest to Native Hawaiian voyaging and colonizing of Nihoa(/Nihua) and Necker. Nihoa(/Nihua) also has Necker-style manaes. They may also have been part of a migratory movement towards the Hawaiian Islands. (See: Sacred Places North America by Brad Olsen (2008) for succinct information.) In his book Isles of Refuge (2001, Page 49) Mark Rauzon writes: "We could see the shrines along the crest of Necker. To the crew, they symbolized pushing the limits and proving one's sailing ability. Perhaps the rigid structure of the ancient class society in the main islands may have forced independent-spirited people to set off on their own and seek new lands. Each voyage might have required a shrine and could account for the thirty-three marae on Necker." Nihoa(/Nihua) it is a dry place covered with brush and grasses. The only tree growing there is an endemic palm. Nihoa(/Nihua) is home to a tremendous amount of birds and lots of marine life, including seals and turtles. The numerous ruins include cultivation terraces, house sites, and ceremonial structures. It is estimated that the island could have sustained a small population of perhaps 100 to 150 people.
Closer to the main Hawaiian islands is Kahoolawe, a low and unfertile island. It is the smallest island of the Hawaiian island chain, comprising 8 major volcanic islands. It is located 10 kilometres southwest of Maui Island. It has had transient inhabitants but has not retained a permanent population. It is considered a sacred island and has more than 600 archaeological and culturally significant sites. Tubuai is part of the present-day Austral Island Group (Tubuai Islands), one of a number of islands east of the Cook Islands. The Tubuai Islands are a long chain of remote islands located in the far South Pacific. There are seven main islands of which five are inhabited. The largest island is Tubuai. Tubuai is one of several islands close to the Tropic of Capricorn that has an unusually large number of temple platforms. There are hundreds of ceremonial sites located throughout Polynesia. There is little evidence for any intentional astronomical alignments. The astronomer William Liller, who investigated the temple platforms first-hand, has not established any clear evidence for astronomical alignment of temple platforms on Necker. (Liller, William. (2000). "Necker Islands, Hawai`i: Astronomical Implications of an island located on the Tropic of Cancer." (Rapa Nui Journal, Volume 14, Number 4, December, Pages ?-?).) Polynesian ethnographic literature makes no mention of a solar cult. According to the archaeoastronomer Clive Ruggles there is no evidence that the early Polynesian voyagers "were interested in determining the zenith passage of the sun very precisely." An astronomical explanation for the high number of temple platforms may not be relevant. The archaeoastronomer Clive Ruggles suggests the sacredness of Necker may simply originate "from its extreme location - an end place beyond which there were no more habitable islands." (See: Ancient Astronomy: An Encyclopedia of Cosmologies and Myth by Clive Ruggles (2005).) It is also possible that Necker served as some sort of pilgrimage site. Perhaps because of the combination of the occurrence of a single zenith and its extreme location as an 'end place.'
The Magellan fallacy in Hamlet's Mill
This is an example of how carefully their "facts" need to be checked.
On page xiii of the original edition of Hamlet's Mill it is stated that Magellan had confided the steering of his ships (more than once) to Polynesian navigators. This part of an attempt to show how good the Polynesians were as navigators. However, it is false to claim that Magellan used Polynesian navigators. In 1521 a Spanish expedition of 3(5?) ships led by the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan was the first known complete crossing of the Pacific Ocean. Magellan had the misfortune to sail all the way across the Pacific Ocean from the tip of South America, right along Polynesia and Micronesia and did not make a landfall until he reached the Mariana Islands. This long trek across the Pacific Ocean resulted in the death of a lot of his crew, and those that survived came down with scurvy, so it obviously wasn't planned that way. The food supply became very low. His surviving men were semi-starved when they reached landfall in the Mariana Islands (in Micronesia). (To stay alive the crew ate the leather rigging from the ship.) In the Mariana Islands he fought with the occupants (he called the place "Island of Thieves") so he obviously wasn't taking any navigators on board there. His next landfall was the Philippine Islands where he was killed during a tribal skirmish on Mactan Island, known as the Battle of Mactan. He became involved in local politics and aggressively attacked the occupants of Mactan Island. Magellan never even saw a Polynesian. Any person who had even superficially studied the European exploration of the Pacific Ocean and/or the European exploration of Polynesia would know this.
An example of a random grab and squeeze fit
This is an example of forced meanings.
Selecting something rather obscure: On page 272 (footnote 20) there is a strange reference to Aeschylus' Agamemnon (the 1st play of the Oresteia). The authors of Hamlet's Mill state that the beacon announcing the fall of Troy at the beginning of the Oresteia was really something to



do with Saturn, and had nothing to do with communicating the Greek victory back to Argos. However, reading a good translation of Agamemnon it is clear that Clytemnestra (the wife of Agamemnon) has arranged for a series of signal beacons to carry the news to her so she can prepare a fitting homecoming welcome for Agamemnon when he returns. (She murders him.) That is the entire point of the opening scenes. Exactly from where or how the authors of Hamlet's Mill got their particular notion that the "beacon" is strange and to be excluded as a signalling device and is connected with Saturn as a "living" plumb line is left unexplained.
An example of the use of an outdated translation and an outdated discussion
The initial use (1969) and continued use (1993) of Ephraim Speiser's 1966 outdated translation of Enuma Elish in the 'Appendix: Excursus on Gilgamesh' is not redeemed by use of an outdated footnote discussion of whether Lumashi-stars mean the zodiacal constellations/zodiacal signs, or other constellations/stars. As contrast: The lengthy article "Mesopotamian Accounts of Creation" by W. H. in Encyclopedia of Cosmology edited by Norriss Hetherington (1993). In the translation of passages of Enuma Elish included, the 3rd passage of Tablet 5 (see page 396) of Enuma Elish is translated without mention of the zodiac. This reflects the knowledge that an epic originating from the Assyrian period (latest date of composition circa 1100 BCE, but likely composed earlier - circa mid 2nd-millennium BCE) would be unable to to include a reference to the zodiac as the zodiac did not exist at that time. The modern translation used is likely that by Stephanie Dalley (Myths from Mesopotamia (1989)). It can be concluded that selectivity is being used here. A properly revised text of Hamlet's Mill would have excluded continued use of Ephraim Speiser's 1966 outdated translation of Enuma Elish. However, this would eliminate what had been viewed as an important piece of literary evidence. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion of shoddy/misleading scholarship.
An example of a biased conclusion
"This brief sketch of archaic theory indicates - to repeat = that geography in our sense was never meant, but a cosmography of the kind needed even now by navigators. Ptolemy, the great geographer of antiquity, had been thinking of nothing else. His Geography is a set of coordinates drawn from the skies, and transferred onto an uncouth outline map of our globe, with a catalogue of earthly distances added on by sailors and travelers to pinpoint, or confirm, the positions of countries around the Mediterranean world. It was an uncouth outline map, for it covered only a few countries known around the Mediterranean region. Nothing was shown beyond the latitude 16° south of the equator and 63° north, corresponding to Iceland. Nothing west beyond the Canary Islands or east of the easternmost city of China, an arc of longitude fixed for simplicity at 180°, twelve equinoctial hours from end to end, the breadth over the whole latitudes being nine equinoctial hours. A large part of the space is blank and the limits are assigned, as they should be, astronomically. This is what the ancients knew after a thousand years of exploration, and they handed it down to the Renaissance. They called it the oikoumene, the inhabited earth." (Hamlet's Mill, Pages 63-64.)
Source: The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy by James Evans (1998, Page 102).The interpretation/conclusion by the authors of Hamlet's Mill is not really warranted.
An example of lack of specialist knowledge
The authors assert (pages 437-443) that nothing is known of the (symbolic meaning of) the pukku and the mekku i.e., what they are. The assyriologist/sumerologist Bendt Alster points out that this is not quite true. We have cuneiform texts that provide information. It is indicated that they may symbolize Gilgamesh' power to oppose death. Also, as long as Gilgamesh possesses these tools he is able to function as the divine ruler. The pukku definitely symbolizes the supernatural power of Gilgamesh. Also both are symbols of a divine charisma which Gilgamesh has misused and lost. When Gilgamesh loses his pukku and mekku he has lost his divine charisma.
An example of no point really being made
Within the latter part of Hamlet's Mill there is an illustration (facing page 435) tagged "The zodiacal Pisces, as drawn by the Toba Batak of Sumatra." No specific discussion is given for this illustration or similar. However, the inference is the zodiac has travelled a long distance from the Near East in antiquity. But simply, the Toba Batak "Pisces" is likely derived from centuries of trade contacts with Arabic and Indian cultures, beginning as early as circa 200 CE. These trade contacts expanded during the medieval period. There is no evidence for ancient astronomical code here.
Regarding the Central American scorpion goddess/constellation
Scorpions are found on all major land masses except Antarctica. Some were likely unintentionally introduced into the islands in Oceania. Small non-vernomous scorpions inhabit the islands of Polynesia. The scorpion is a significant animal culturally in a number of cultures/civilisations world-wide. The authors of Hamlet's Mill believed they had found connections between the scorpion myths in such widely divergent locations as the ancient Near East (the goddess Išhara), Egypt (the goddess Selket-Serqet), Central America (the "old goddess with the scorpion's tail"), and Polynesia (no scorpion goddess; in Polynesia the stars of Scorpius are often seen as a fishhook).
The existence of a Maya scorpion goddess and constellation (and others in the geographic region of Central America), mentioned in Hamlet's Mill, is hardly evidence for assuming an Old World connection for any reason (including being a single remnant of a Neolithic astronomical monomyth originating in the Near East. The star grouping comprising the Maya scorpion constellation is thought to be slightly different. Regardless, the star pattern for the Scorpion constellation has the shape of a scorpion - it is one of the few constellation figures that actually looks like what it is named (i.e., supposed to be). An independent invention is suggested simply by the visual pattern readily suggesting the figure of a scorpion. The stars even suggest the hook of the scorpion's tail. (The diffusion of the constellation iconography would/should also be facilitated.) The Aztecs of Central Mexico also had a scorpion constellation. The North American Indians had scorpion beliefs but did not have a scorpion constellation. The stars there usually denoted other figures. The Maya scorpion constellation is the only Maya constellation which is the same figure as in the Western zodiac. The scorpion is one of the constellations in the Paris Codex (where it is connected with a solar eclipse), which has been tentatively dated to circa 1450, in the Late Postclassic period (1200 CE–1525 CE). However, a far earlier date for Maya astronomers recognising the scorpion constellation has been proposed. The Lowland Maya scorpion constellation may go back to circa 900 BCE and be associated with the planet Venus. See: Star gods of the Maya: astronomy in art, folklore, and calendars by Susan Milbrath (1999, Page 211). The Maya existed from circa 1800 BCE (the beginning of the Preclassic period) to circa 900 CE (when there was a widespread political collapse in the central Maya region). The Postclassic period (which saw the rise of Chichen Itza in the north, and the expansion of the aggressive K'iche' kingdom in the Guatemalan Highlands) is dated from circa 950 CE to 1539 CE (the period of the Spanish conquest). There is no evidence that the Central American scorpion constellation corresponded with/derived from the Western zodiacal scorpion constellation. Also, there is no evidence that a Central American scorpion goddess is connected with a Western scorpion goddess.
Possibly the earliest Western (i.e., Near Eastern) mention of a scorpion constellation is in the Ura = hubulla star listing. Part of the particular entry reads: "Scorpion"; ziqit GÍR.TAB "The Sting of the Scorpion." The Ura[Urra]=hubullu (ur5-ra=ḫubullu) is a major (and also oldest known) Babylonian glossary/dictionary (or "encyclopedia") consisting of Sumerian and Akkadian lexical lists ordered by topic. The series of tablets



comprise bilingual word lists in Sumerian and Akkadian. The late (circa 1000 BCE) canonical version extends to 24 tablets. Tablet 22 of the series includes a list of 61 star names. "... [A]fter the sublist e = iku, is a list of stars that begin with ul = kakkabu and mul = kakkabu at Ura XXII: 266'-267'. Immediately after this are entries for mul.mul, "The Stars" (The Pleiades), and then sixty more stars which brings us down to Ura XXII: 327'. This star list occupies most of the fifth column of a number of manuscripts." (Block, Yigal. and Horowitz, Wayne. (2015). "Ura = hubulla XXII: The Standard Recension." (Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Volume 67, Pages 71-125).) The text of Ura XXII is currently (2015) based on 12 main sources and 20 school tablets. The majority of tablets come from Babylonia: Babylon, Kish, Uruk, and Ur; and possibly Borsippa, Dilbat, and Sippar. A small number of tablets come from Assyria: Huzirina, and Assur. One bilingual version excavated from Ugarit [RS2.(23)+] is Sumerian/Hurrian rather than Sumerian/Akkadian. It was excavated at Ebla in modern Syria and dates from the early 2nd millennium BCE. The bulk of the series was compiled in the Old Babylonian period (early 2nd millennium BCE), with pre-canonical forerunner documents extending back to the late 3rd millennium BCE. The extant sources for Ura XXII are written in 1st millennium script and dated to circa 1000 BCE.
Another early mention is in the tablet VAT 7445 which lists "GÍR.TAB [The Scorpion]." The tablet VAT 7445 (published in KUB, Volume 4, Number 47) recovered from Boghazköy (the capital of the Hittite empire) in the early 19th-century, preserves a Hittite prayer/haruspicy ritual (based on the Old Babylonian Period Prayer to the Gods of the Night) that enumerates 17 stars/constellations (belonging to the path of Ea). VAT 7445 is dated to circa 1300/1200 BCE. It is possible that the Boghazköy prayer/haruspicy ritual and star-list was earlier than the "astrolabe texts."
The next earliest mention is in Hilprecht's Nippur Text (HS 229 now HS 245) which lists: "star GIR.TAB [gír.tab] (Scorpio)." Based on the discussion of tablet HS 245 in Science Awakening II: The Birth of Astronomy by Bartel van der Waerden. This tablet (setting out an illustrative example for a school mathematical problem-solving text) dates to the Kassite Period (1530-1160 BCE) and the tablet is specifically dated between 1300-1000 BCE. Though purporting to measure distances in the sky The Hilprecht Text preserves preserves part of a mathematical exercise text concerning astronomical distances rather than a serious attempt to investigate distances between stars.
Regarding the scorpion goddess Išhara. The scorpion is the symbol of the (ancient Near Eastern) goddess Išhara (who dates at least to the 3rdmillennium BCE). In the 3rd-millennium BCE she was an important goddess at Ebla. The association between the scorpion and Išhara occurred during the Kassite period. (The earlier evidence is indefinite.) On a kudurru the scorpion is the symbol of the goddess Išhara (and may also be interpreted as meaning the scorpion constellation). But perhaps there is some connection with the male figure of the scorpion in Babylonian demonology. There may be another explanation. The goddess Išhara is identified with 'The Scorpion' in the Astrolabe 'star catalogues.' See: The Three Stars Each by Wayne Horowitz (2014, Page 149) for the identification of mulGIR.TAB ('The Scorpion') as the Goddess of Heaven and Earth per Išhara as bēlet dadmē ('Lady of the World'), in Mul.Apin I ii 29.
Hans Ludendorff and Maya astronomy
The authors of Hamlet's Mill write (1st edition, page 61): "No professional historian of culture is likely to understand better the intellectual frame of mind of the Maya than the astronomer Hans Ludendorff has done." No justification is given for this statement. However, this confidence is misplaced. Friedrich Wilhelm Hans Ludendorff (1873-1941) was a German astronomer and astrophysicist. Ludendorff was interested in the astronomical knowledge of the older American civilizations, especially of the Mayans. He passionately investigated various Mayan inscriptions, relating them to conspicuous constellations antedating the Christian era. He also authored a number of pamphlet studies on the astronomy of PreColumbian civilizations, especially that of the Mayas. See: Ludendorff, Hans. (1930-1943). Untersuchungen zur Astronomie der Maya, 1-15. Since 1930, Ludnedorff devoted himself mainly to the astronomy of the Maya Indians. Much of his work has been discredited. (As a striking example: J.E.S. Thompson wrote in 1972 that "over thirty years ago I was able to show that Ludendorff obtained a higher percentage of astronomical phenomena on dates that had been incorrectly deciphered than on those correctly deciphered.") Ludendorff noted that the calendar data given in the Dresden Mayan Code and in numerous inscriptions in stone monuments coincided with certain celestial phenomena that are visible to the naked eye, such as conjunctions, ascents, sunsets, and eclipses. These coincidences only accumulated when he used Spinden's assumption for the relation of the Mayan calendar to today's calendar. On the other hand, assuming Thompson's relation, which is preferred by the prehistorians, there were only a few such coincidences. "The famed Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson (the villain in Michael Coe's Breaking the Maya Code) confronted this situation in 1935 when reviewing the work of Hans Ludendorff for his early consideration of the calendar correlation question. Ludendorff pooled together a set of dates from Classic period hieroglyphic inscriptions, and then found a number of astronomical periods within them. Thompson, however, checked his math and found that many of Ludendorff's dates were reconstructed incorrectly. Thompson's further analysis showed that there were more "relevant" astronomical patterns among the incorrectly reconstructed dates, than among those that were accurately reconstructed. The point being that Ludendorff generated a large data set that was essentially random, relative to the patterns he found interesting. The constraints were sufficiently few (looking for celestial events) that patterns were generated simply resulting from Ramsey Theory, not because Mayan scribes did intentionally build them into these hieroglyphic inscriptions."

Strangely, Hans Ludendorff accepted Arthur Posnansky's astronomical dating of circa 15,000 BCE for Tiwanaku (Tiahuanaco) in Bolivia. The dating was fantasy. Posnansky's method involved measuring the astronomical correlation of one of the site's temples. However, due to the extensive disturbances to the structures (i.e., mining for stones, crushing of large artifacts for ballasting railway tracks, defacing of structures, looting of statues, etc.), and the alterations and reconstructions, Tiwanaku is unsuitable for dating by archaeoastronomy. As example: In the 1890's an estimated 500 train-loads of stones from Tiahuanaco were carted away by the British contractors of the railway to build bridges and station houses, and whatnot, along the line from La Paz to Lake Titicaca, as it was a cheaper source of rock than mining the nearby sandstone quarries. To obtain metal the British even used dynamite. Much of Tiwanaku had been destroyed long before the Spanish Conquest. Posnansky assumed that any astronomical alignments were unaltered by the massive amount of destruction that had taken place at the site. Arthur Posnansky (1873-1946), often called "Arturo," was an engineer who received his training in Bavaria. He spent some 50 years of his life in Bolivia. Arthur Posnansky was at various times in his life an engineer, explorer, ship's navigator, director of a river navigation company, entrepreneur, La Paz city council member. Posnansky, who was professor of archaeology at La Paz, had little interest in archaeology and it is not known whether he did any excavating. He could be described as a self-styled archaeologist. He is incorrectly described as a well known and well respected avocational archaeologist.
Between 1927 and 1930 Posnansky's conclusions were apparently studied by several astronomers. It is stated that Hans Ludendorff (Director of the Astronomical Observatory of Potsdam), Friedrich Becker of the Specula Vaticana (Vatican Observatory), Arnold Kohlschutter (astronomer at Bonn University), and Rolf Müller (astronomer of the Institute of Astrophysics at Potsdam) supposedly carefully checked the archaeoastronomical



research and accuracy of Posnansky's calculations and vouched for the reliability of his conclusions. It is also stated they worked as a team. The descriptor "Friedrich Becker of the Specula Vaticana" is copied from author to author. Becker is also described as an " honorary Vatican astronomer." I do not know what the original source is - it may have been Posnansky. Friedrich Becker (1900-1985) undertook Postdoctoral studies at the Vatican Observatory (1924–1926). He collaborated with Johann Hagen, the director of the Vatican observatory, for about a year and a half around about 1925 in organizing the data which Hagen had collected on the dark clouds ("gray cosmic clouds"). What Hagen was observing, or thought he was observing, was a problematic/controversial issue. (At the Vatican observatory, Becker studied at first variable stars.) In 1926, Becker was invited to travel to Bolivia and be involved in a project of southern sky observations. He was an observer at La Paz, the station of Potsdam Observatory, 1926–1928. He was an assistant astronomer at Potsdam 1928–1930 and staff astronomer at Bonn in 1930. Becker received his habilitation in 1931. Later he was an astronomer at Bonn.- and became director of the Bonn Observatory.
The conventional practice of dating Tiahuanacu as beginning circa 200 CE and collapsing circa 1000 CE started with Wendell Bennett's scientific excavations in the 1930's, which unearthed numerous examples of pottery, small statues and other artifacts. See: Excavations at Tiahuanaco by Wendell Clark Bennett (1934).
Another person creating fantasies was Edmund Kiss. Edmund Kiss (1886– 960) was a German pseudo-archaeologist and writer. He was a German building contractor and novelist, and was a fantasist. He spent 9 years in the Andes and "excavated" (= unscientifically dug pits) at the site of Tiahuanaco. According to Kiss, Tiahuanaco was built in 27,000 BCE. The pseudo-archaeology of Posnansky and Kiss is not harmless, for it deliberately rewrites the prehistoric past. Kiss was supported by the Nazi institution, the Ahnenerbe, because of his findings that Tiwanaku was Nordic and his theories supported Hans Hörbiger's Welteislehre, a pseudo-science. German pseudo-archaeologists plans culminated in the Ahnenerbe's plans for a major expedition to Bolivia in 1939 to find proof for Hörbiger's theories.
Excursus: Arthur Posnansky and Tiahuanaco
Arthur Posnansky (1873-1946), often called "Arturo", was at various times in his life an engineer (Bavarian trained), explorer, ship's navigator, director of a river navigation company, entrepreneur/business man, La Paz city council member, and well known and not always respected avocational archaeologist. Also, director of the Tiahuanacu Institute of Prehistorics in La Paz, and president of both the Geographical and Archaeological Societies of Bolivia. Though professor of archaeology at La Paz he developed no students to carry on his work. Posnansky had little interest in archaeology as such. It is not evident that he carried out any excavations. He devoted a major part of his life to examining and describing the site. He had no interest in stratigraphic study. Arthur Posnansky was trained as a naval engineer and was an Austrian émigré to Bolivia. He became obsessed with Tiahuanaco. He speculated that the builders of Tiahuanaco had to have come from elsewhere. Posnansky claimed Tiahuanaco was the origin from which the Americas were populated. He is justifiably ridiculed for his naive views and hare-brained claims about Tiahuanaco's age and development, and his fanciful interpretations of the meaning of its monuments and iconography. As selfproclaimed expert and guardian of the site he rendered an important service in raising awareness of the site's historic significance, in documenting it, and in sheltering many of its important artifacts. Interestingly, he also sold artifacts to friends, collectors, and foreign museums. His major work, Tihuanacu: The Cradle of American Man (1945, eventually 4 volumes), is still considered an important reference work for students of Tiahuanaco architecture. However, there are several recent publications that are important. For example: The Stones of Tiahuanaco by Jean-Pierre Protzen and Stella Nair (2013). The proposed age of the site has changed significantly over the last century. From 1910 to 1945, Arthur Posnansky maintained that the site was 11,000–17,000 years old based on comparisons to geological eras and archaeoastronomy. Professional researchers have recognized this date as unreliable. The consensus among archaeologists is that Tiahuanaco emerged suddenly around 300 CE and reached its zenith between 500 and 900 CE. Nothing recovered from Tiahuanaco, or understood about it, suggests "Hamlet's Mill ideas" (e.g., precessional mythology). Inca culture originated from Tiahuanaco. For a critical portrait of Posnansky see: "Arthur Posnansky, the Czar of Tiwanaku Archaeology." by Erik Marsh (Archaeology. Bulletin of the History of Archaeology, Volume 29, Number 1, Pages 1-17).
The main argument of Hamlet's Mill is the claim of an early (Neolithic) discovery of the precession of the equinoxes. No one has produced a convincing argument for precessional knowledge in the architecture/culture of Tiahuanaco. There have been several attempts to associate Hamlet's Mill ideas with Tiahuanaco (e.g., The Lost Science of the Andes, http://lostscienceoftheandes.com/tag/tiahuanaco/).
Although the Preface to Tihuanacu: The Cradle of American Man states that Volume 1 is a thorough revision of the earlier book - Eine
Praehistorische Metropole in Siidamerika (1914) - the changes are minimal. It is basically a reprinting of Eine Praehistorische Metropole in
Siidamerika (1914). Volume 2 is mainly a detailed descriptive record of the ruins of Tiahuanaco. The interpretative sections involve identification of design symbols and estimates of age based on astronomical observations. Posnansky thought that Tiahuanaco was a solar observatory, built with such accuracy that any deviations from the sun's present orbit could be used for dating. Other types of evidence, such as weathering, associated extinct animals, and fossilized bones, were used to confirm his great age for Tiahuanaco. He also argued that the great temples were destroyed by a cataclysm circa 12,000 BCE. Neither the evidence nor the conclusions for any of his claims are presented in a manner acceptable to scientific archaeology.
Some identified 'pivot points' for Hamlet's Mill
Hertha von Dechend identifies: (1) her astronomical explanation (the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn) to account for the high numbers of temple platforms on Necker and Tubuai, (2) her reading Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel by Franz Kugler and deciding that Babylonian prescientific astronomy is saturated with mythological ideas, and (3) Marcel Griaule's account of the beliefs of the Dogon people of West Africa and their placement of terrestrial events in the sky. Note: Babylonian prescientific astronomy is closely connected with omenology rather than mythological ideas.
According to von Dechend, Plato's Timaeus is the very nucleus of archaic cosmological traditions. (Introduction to Ancient Cosmology (1966, Page 1).) "Plato could still speak the language of archaic myth. ... He made myth consonant with his thought, as he built the first modern philosophy. He could speak it, because he was a Pythagorean, and myth was their technical language." (Introduction to Ancient Cosmology (1966, Page 37).)
"A central feature of archaic cosmology is the association of the seven planets [including the Sun and Moon] with the seven stars of the Big Dipper. To every planet belongs one star of Ursa Major. You find this system in ancient Mesopotamia, in Egypt, in Ancient China; it is extremely popular in India right from the beginning." Vice versa the stars of Ursa Major are counted among the planets. (Introduction to Ancient Cosmology (1966, Page 15).)
Ancient texts are translated by philologists who never expect technical language and are unfamiliar with scientific facts and data generally. Hence the proper context has been overlooked. (Introduction to Ancient Cosmology (1966, Page 3).) However, von Dechend, who is not a philologist, does not seem to have encountered any problems developing her ideas of ancient cosmology from variously translated texts.



Leo Frobenius
Leo Frobenius (born 1873, Berlin, Germany-died 1938, Biganzolo, Italy) was a charismatic German explorer, ethnologist/ethnographer and archaeologist (and cultural philosopher = theoretician). He was a private scholar (i.e., independent scholar) for most of his career. Frobenius was a self-taught student of African culture. During the 1890s he began publishing books on travel literature and museum collections. Leo Frobenius was accredited as the originator of the concepts of the Kulturkreise ('culture circles') and of the Paideuma (or "soul" of a culture that is considered to act more or less independently to the people comprising the culture). The book Paideuma (which went through a 2nd edition) was meant to introduce readers to the "soul-like qualities" of cultures. Later, after expanding the concepts of the Kulturkreise, Frobenius proposed what he called the Paideuma. The term is Greek for 'education' (roughly translated), but in Frobenius’ usage it took on a meaning akin to the classic romantic idea of the Volksgeist. This is the 'soul' of a culture, a basic 'psychic' principle which determined any given configuration of culture traits. Furthermore, through his search for African culture configurations, he helped develop the notion of ‘worldview’ (German, Weltanschauung) which was to especially dominate American anthropology for a considerable period. Note: The concept of 'psychic' = similar mentality of human beings to react and think similarly with like environmental situation.
The "culture circle" concept was inspired by Friedrich Ratzel and his idea expanded by Leo Frobenius in his Vienna based Kulturkreise or "Culture Circle" approach. Due to his Kulturkreise proposal not being supported by sufficient evidence Frobenius was not formally credited with the idea. Leo Frobenius had no formal university education, he was involved in extensive research in Africa, and during these expeditions he collected an enormous number of cultural items. (The geographer Frederick Ratzell (1844-1904) was the founder of the Culture History Approach and the key influence for Leo Frobenius.) Paideuma (1921) by Leo Frobenius was a major influence on the Jungian mythologist Joseph Campbell. It is an irrational idea and is now discarded by modern research. The concept of paideuma was developed by Frobenius on his own African expeditions. Frobenius was an amateur scholar of myth. Early in his life he worked as a business apprentice for an export firm in Bremen, Germany, and studied Greek, anthropology, and mythology at night. He lacked formal academic qualifications and was criticized by scientists for his non-systematic and rather romantic approach to anthropology. Frobenius was involved in extensive research in Africa, which was made possible by donors and by his own income from books and lectures. Without having gained a senior university degree (he never completed the requirements for his PhD), Frobenius had to rely on journalism and his expedition sponsors. Much of his support comprised laypersons rather than scholars. Leo Frobenius received funding from at least three major German museums to work in French and British territories in North and West Africa as late as the first decade of the 20th-century. The purpose of Frobenius's field expeditions was to find evidence of the Weltanschauungen (Worldviews) of the Kulturkreise concept that he adhered to. Frobenius left school without gaining any formal qualifications because his family moved constantly (due to his father's occupation as a fortification architect/builder – his father, Lieutenant-Colonel Herman Frobenius, was a Prussian military officer), and Frobenius did not attend school regularly. For this reason he could not satisfactorily take up his studies at a university but became an autodidact. His PhD thesis was rejected. The title Dr is either honourary or mistaken. (Frobenius was bestowed an honourary professorship at Frankfurt University in 1932, and therefore gained the right to teach there.) Frobenius became director of Frankfurt's ethnographic museum in 1934. Leo Frobenius, a student (pupil) and colleague of the Austrian anthropologist Friedrich Ratzel, expanded on the "culture circle" concept. See: Frobenius, Leo (1898) Die Weltanschauung der Naturvolker. A revival of the "sun-myth" theory was attempted by Leo Frobenius. Stucken, Frobenius, and Ehrenreich all assumed that sun myths are primarily representations of celestial phenomena. (The pioneering English anthropologist, Edward Tylor (1832-1917) also attempted to revive the "sun-myth" theory. For Tylor, sun myths describe sun gods and not merely the sun as a natural phenomenon.) Edward Tylor was a Quaker, with no formal university training. Early in life he travelled to Mexico (from 1855-56) and began publishing his theories of cultural evolutionism in 1871. In 1896 became the first professor of new field of anthropology at Oxford University.
Frobenius was a diffusionist who spent a lot of time in Africa. He was also a "museum ethnologist" who looked for parallels in cultural development worldwide. He spent considerable time as an independent researcher in the Berlin Museum of Ethnology. In ethnology/anthropology, diffusion has been taken to be the process by which material and immaterial cultural and social forms spread in space i.e., between one culture and another. Frobenius was an early and influential proponent of the diffusionist cultural migration theory. He believed that parallel mythic themes were diffused from a few myth-producing cultural centres. For example, he believed there was a central myth-producing region that stretched from West Africa to India, and from there through Indonesia and Oceania to the Americas. He is credited with being the first radical diffusionist. (Leo Frobenius and Friedrich Ratzel were advocating diffusionist theories for decades before Graebner and Ankermann did.) Frobenius believed that parallel myths were the result of cultural exchanges between ancient peoples on a scale not considered possible by most scholars. His book Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes (1904) was described as concerning itself with the "Darwinian diffusion of solar myths." Ugo Bianchi states that for Frobenius the mythology of 'primitive' people was to be understood as cosmological (i.e., as a mythical interpretation and vision of the real world). Leo Frobenius first conceptualized his views on cultural diffusion in his 1897/1898 publication Der westafrikanische Kulturkreis. In his 1897/1898 book Frobenius defined several "culture areas" (Kulturkreise), cultures showing similar traits that have been spread by diffusion or invasion. The Pansolarism of Frobenius is not given a Babylonian origin. According to Frobenius myths originated in and were completely developed in several individual geographical provinces and then migrated in fragmented form to other regions.
The diffusionism of Frobenius became extremely radical. He came close to denying the existence of any unique cultural traits.
During his lifetime Frobenius (or at least in the early part of the 20th-century) was regarded as one of the world's foremost authorities on the art of preliterate people (prehistoric art). Thor Heyerdahl's epic 1947 balsa-wood boat journey from Peru to Polynesia was influenced by the theories of Frobenius. After an appointment lasting several years at the Bremen Ubersee-Museum [ethnological museum] and also apparently at the ethnological museums of Leipzig and Basle, Frobenius eventually he went on to found in 1920 (and be director of) the Institute for the Study of Morphology of Civilization in Munich. This was a private research institute based on his own collection of material. It also appears he used his own funds to establish it. (It is sometimes stated it was established in Frankfort am Main.) It was destroyed by Allied bombing in World War II. (Also during WWII the African Institute and Ethnological Museum in Frankfort was destroyed with many of its treasures.) Circa 1925, Frankfurt acquired Frobenius' holding of approximately 4,700 pre-historic rock paintings from Africa. These paintings survived Allied bombing during WWII and are part of Frankfurt University's Institute of Ethnology, which was rechristened Frobenius Institut in 1946 to honour the explorer. Cultural morphology conceives of cultures as living organisms that are "born," "progress," and finally "die," and are dominate by paideuma. Cultural morphology is an irrational idea and is now discarded by modern research. In 1935, Frobenius was Director of Frankfurt's Municipal Ethnographic Museum.
Frobenius believed that sunrise, sunset, and the moon were the important catalysts of mythmaking.
It is stated that Frobenius remained an eagerly expected guest of Kaiser Wilhelm II. However, it appears he only briefly met Kaiser Wilhelm II once. In 1912 Frobenius had been invited to meet with the Kaiser and to report on his work. Wilhelm II apparently gave considerable sums from his private funds to finance Frobenius' further North African journeys between 1912 and 1914. After WWI Wilhelm was no longer the German emperor and was living in exile in the Netherlands. It appears that in this circumstance he was visited by Frobenius. D. H. Lawrence's interest in



primitive cultures was indebted to the research of Leo Frobenius, especially The Voice of Africa (1913), which Lawrence read in the spring of 1918.
His work is now regarded as outdated and flawed. He created dozens of speculative/foolish theories. In 1911 Leo Frobenius claimed to have discovered the 'lost continent of Atlantis' in Africa. The eccentric Leo Frobenius stated that Atlantis was part of Nigeria (western side) in the Yoruba country and the African Atlantis was the fragment that survived. The African Atlantis is a discredited theory. Frobenius was not willing to credit Africans as the innovators of traditional African art. He instead held that these arts originated from ancient Greco-Roman influence. Frobenius believed the people and culture of Nigeria descended from Atlantis (Plato's imaginary continent). This belief was the reason for his 1910-1912 collecting expedition Nigeria. This was funded by the German ethnological museums of Berlin, Hamburg, and Leipzig. Frobenius made 6 German government funded expeditions to Africa in the 10 years from 1904 to 1914. Between 1904 and 1933 Frobenius conducted 12 African expeditions. He collected ethnographic data, oral traditions, material objects, and folklore. Frobenius was confident of his ability to judge the non-Africanness of certain (art) objects - needless to say, a highly subjective and unempirical process. He was also convinced he could trace the early migrations of humankind by the comparison of their artistic symbolism. See: "Leo Frobenius and the Revolt Against the Western World." by Suzanne Marchand in Journal of Contemporary History, Volume 32, Number 2, April, 1997, Pages 153-170. See also: "Anthropologists and Other Frauds." by Graham Huggan (Comparative Literature, Volume 46, Issue 2, Spring, 1994, Pages 113-128). Accuses Leo Frobenius of "anthropological fraudulence." About the author (2008): Graham Huggan is chair of Commonwealth and Postcolonial Literatures in the School of English at the University of Leeds, and co-director of the Leeds Institute for Colonial and Postcolonial Studies. He previously taught at Harvard University and is the author of numerous volumes, including The Postcolonial Exotic (1994). Further, The intersection of modern art, anthropology, and politics in colonial Nigeria, 1910-1914. by Olubukola Gbadegesin (Master of Arts thesis, Emory University, 2006), and also the (French-language) article: "Critiques d'epoque sur Leo Frobenius." by Arlette Roth (Litt. Or. Ara-Berb., Volume 26, 1998, Pages 339-350). See also the obituary for Leo Frobenius in Nature, Volume 142, 1938, Page 562. It is well recognised that Frobenius was a master of hype. Doubts have been expressed about the authenticity of myths that Frobenius published in 1921 concerning the Berber-speaking region of Kabylia in northern Algeria. See: Le Conte Kabyle by Camille Lacoste-Dujardin (1970), a book on Kabyle folktales. See also: Leo Frobenius and the Reorientation of German Ethnology, 1890-1930 by DeWitt Clinton Durham (1985).
"Frobenius never completed the requirements for an earned doctorate. Much of his following consisted of laypeople rather than scholars. Until he established himself at the new University of Frankfort in the 1920s, he was very much an outsider." (Politics and the Sciences of Culture in Germany, 1840-1920 by Woodruff Smith (1991, Page 266).) In 1932 he became honorary professor at the University of Frankfurt, and in 1935 director of the municipal ethnographic museum.
"He [Frobenius] conducted his field expeditions across Africa as hunting trips in search of signs of the Weltanschauungen of the Kulturkreise he was investigating and paid relatively little attention to the ways in which the people he visited actually lived." (Politics and the Sciences of Culture in Germany, 1840-1920 by Woodruff Smith (1991, Page 158).)
Frobenius was a maverick who through a series of successful expeditions through equatorial Africa to obtain cultural material slowly gained the acceptance of professional German ethnologists/anthropologists. Until he established himself at the University of Frankfurt he was an outsider in academic/scholarly circles. A key method of German ethnology in the later 19th-century and early 20th-century was the accumulation and comparison of material culture that had been obtained overseas. Frobenius conducted research in the Berlin Museum of Ethnology as an independent scholar.

Dada [DADA] Rivista di Antropologia post-globale, Anno V, Numero 2,-Speciale 2015, Antropologia e Religione, Pages 241-250, Page 241. Frobenius believed that there were universal mythological themes ("mythologems") that were connected with an archaic cosmology. He published 2 books cataloging these mythological themes: (1) Die Weltanschauung der Naturvölker [= The worldview of primitive peoples] (1898), and (2) Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes [= In the era of the Sun God] (1904). It is evident that this was the basis for von Dechend's own development of world-wide mythic themes. A mythologem is a basic core element, motif or theme of a myth that is recurrent world-wide at diverse times. Examples include: universal flood, fire bringer, revenge, self-sacrifice, and betrayal. Early examples of cataloging mythogems include: Astralmythen by Stucken and Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes by Frobenius.

Frobenius's legacy of odd ideas
Frobenius held a number of bizarre beliefs and theories.
Example 1: Leo Frobenius believed there was an ancient Atlantean culture and thought that it was located on the West Coast of southern Africa in the territory between the Niger and the Atlantic Ocean. Frobenius held that Yoruba culture had been introduced by Etruscans who reached West Africa by way of the “lost continent” of Atlantis.
Example 2: Leo Frobenius argued for a Persian origin for African shamanism.
Example 3: Leo Frobenius was unable to accept the Zimbabwe ruins were Bantu in origin. In 1930 Frobenius announced that he had identified the source of the Zimbabwe civilization (which he dated between 4000 BCE and 1000 BCE) - and many other ruins in Rhodesia, Portuguese East Africa, and Bechuanaland, as Sumerians from near the Caspian Sea.
The influence of Leo Frobenius on Hertha von Dechend (and Giorgio de Santillana)
In his book The Origin of Scientific Thought (1961) Giorgio de Santillana had set out his belief in an astronomical origin of myth and fairytale. (The first (and only) volume of a planned series of 5 volumes dealing with the history of scientific thought. The books were envisaged as anthologies.) However, the book Hamlet's Mill also clearly shows the influence of Hertha von Dechend's teacher Leo Frobenius (who had written several books mirroring some Panbabylonian ideas, and the correspondence between mythological themes and celestial phenomena). The major influential book by Leo Frobenius influencing von Dechend was Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes (1904). During and after her PhD studies at Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität von Dechend was a co-worker at the Frobenius-Institut and the Museum für Völkerkunde. (According to one short obituary notice: "Hertha von Dechend studied ethnology, philosophy, history and archeology (Frankfurt). Ph.D. in 1939. During and after her



studies she was a co-worker at the Frobenius-Institut and the Museum für Völkerkunde. She has been at the IGN since November 1943. Habilitation 1960, apl. Prof. 1966, Emeritus since 1980. 1960-1969 regular research and teaching visits to the M.I.T., Cambridge, MA.") The Frobenius Institut lists her as an Associate Researcher (wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin) from 1939-1945. Hertha von Dechend was very much a disciple of Leo Frobenius. Another disciple of the German anthropologist and cultural philosopher Leo Frobenius was his oldest and most outstanding student, Adolf Ellegard Jensen (1899-1965).
The key ideas of Frobenius included monogenesis and diffusion. In 1897/1898 Frobenius defined several "culture areas" (Kulturkreise), cultures showing similar traits that have been spread by diffusion or invasion. Frobenius believed that migration/invasion was the more important factor for explaining cultural similarities. Kulturkreislehre shaped ethnological work in Central Europe during the first half of the 20th-century. According to the culture area theory, the more widespread an element is, the older and more valid it is.

Hambolu (Editors). Nigeria 100 years ago: Through the eyes of Leo Frobenius and his expedition team. (Pages 27-32).)
Some key ideas in
Hamlet's Mill
"Diffusionist anthropology soon developed as an alternative model to evolutionism and, particularly in the German-speaking countries, it was further elaborated, crystallising into the so-called cultural-historical method ("kulturhistorische Methode"). One of the merits of this particular approach was that it drew attention to the relationship between space and culture. The spatial distance of identical or highly similar cultural phenomena was no longer regarded as the result of pure chance, but rather as evidence of ancient historical connections and a shared cultural complex. As a result, the uniqueness of specific formal characteristics (in particular, production and artisan techniques) in places distant from one another became the focus of attention." (Pages 28-29.)

"A good example of this method is what the leading representative of cultural-historical anthropology, Leo Frobenius, referred to as the "Malayo-Nigritic culture", which was localised both on the Indonesian archipelago as well as on the West African coast (Frobenius 1897). [Frobenius, Leo. (1897). Der westafrikanische Kulturkreis. (Pages 43–44, 225–71)] The fact that these areas are in no way connected and that between these regions there were hundreds of other societies not showing any traces of this culture complex did not constitute a problem for Frobenius. The great distance and the difficulties in reconstructing a route that linked the owners of these cultural phenomena were secondary problems. Clearly, Frobenius was a disciple of the zeitgeist of his time; he strongly believed in the unity of humankind, and he could see only one purpose in anthropology, namely, to explain this unity despite the observable differences." (Page 29.)
See the illustrations between pages 290291; and pages 434435. Throughout Hamlet's Mill the great distance and the difficulties in reconstructing a route that linked the owners of these cultural phenomena were secondary problems. These issues were left untouched in Hamlet's Mill but were touched upon in the MIT seminar notes,
Introduction to Ancient Cosmology.
"The resonance of the cultural-historical method with contemporary thinking was based on the assumption that the mobility of cultural forms and of their carriers was self-evident in any culture. Processes of cultural exchange, migration and the transfer of ideas and techniques across continents are today regarded as consequences of globalisation. From the cultural-historical perspective, however, such links between cultures were considered to be the constants of human existence (Amselle 2001)." [Amselle, Jean-Loup. (2001). Branchements. Anthropologie de l‘universalité des cultures.] (Page 30.)

Introduction to Ancient Cosmology.
Leo Frobenius was a sun myth advocate (Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes (1904) = The Age of the Sun-God) who owed his ideas to the Panbabylonism of Hugo Winckler and Alfred Jeremias. Frobenius maintained that held that all myths had an original allegorical reference to the sun: its rising, setting, and supernatural influence. The figures who appeared in the myths were disguises of the sun in its various aspects. In his extensive travels in Africa and the South Seas Leo Frobenius gathered tales that supported his belief that myths have nearly always been inspired by the sun. The solar myth pattern schematized by Leo Frobenius was used extensively by Carl Jung in his psychological writings ("psychologized by Jung into an intrapsychic, archetypal pattern which applies to every individual on the ontogenetic level"). Both Hüsing (the myth of Cyrus the Great) and Siecke (birth myths of heroes) were moon myth advocates (panlunarism).



Hertha von Dechend was well thought of by Siegfried Seyfarth (2011 interview). He also stated in the interview that she attended annual meetings in honour of Leo Frobenius.
In his Preface to Hamlet's Mill (1969), Giorgio de Santillana writes (Page vii): "... the great Frobenius, whom I had known ...." It is suggested that the ideas of Leo Frobenius were mutually supported by both von Dechend and de Santllana - it was something they had in common.
Frobenius has not been taken seriously by specialists for decades. Frobenius was a highly idiosyncratic writer.
The character of Frobenius's efforts was satirized in the novel Le Devour de violence by Yambo Ouloguem (1968). Frobenius was summed up by J. D. Fage in his 1981 article "The Development of African Historiography." In: General History of Africa. Volume I: Methodology and African Prehistory edited by J. Ki-Zerbo (Pages 37-38): "Frobenius was an ethnologist, a cultural anthropologist and an archaeologist as much as he was a historian, but in his period of activity, corresponding to the first four decades of the twentieth century, he was almost certainly the most productive historian of Africa. He undertook an enormous amount of fieldwork in almost every part of the continent, and presented his results in a steady stream of publications. But these are little read today. He wrote in German, a language which has since become of decreasing relevance to Africa and Africanists. Relatively few of his works have been translated, and their meaning is often difficult to translate because they are encumbered by mystic theories relating to Atlantis, to an Etruscan influence on African culture, and so on. To the highly professional historians, archaeologists and anthropologists of today, Frobenius seems a self-taught eccentric whose work is flawed not only by his outlandish interpretations but also by his rapid, crude and often destructive methods of fieldwork. But he did get results, some of which clearly anticipate those of later, more scientific investigators, and others which may now be difficult or impossible to reproduce in modern conditions. It would seem that he had an instinctive flair for winning the confidence of informants and for establishing historical data. Modern historians might be well advised to rescue this data from his works, and to re-evaluate it in the light of modern knowledge and free from the more fanciful interpretations he placed upon it."
De Santillana and Frobenius
On Page vii (Preface) of Hamlet's Mill de Santillana writes of "... the great Frobenius whom I had known ...his favourite saying "What the hell should I care for my silly notions of yesterday."" No other details seem obtainable as yet. However, it seems indicated that de Santillana had great respect for (the ideas of) Frobenius.
Cultural diffusion
Diffusionism is the spread of ideas, customs, material objects, or practices from one culture to another. (Diffusion is defined as "the spread of certain ideas, customs, or practices from one culture to another." (Anthropology: The Human Challenge by William Haviland, Harald Prins, Bunny McBride, and Dana Walrath (2011 (also given as 2010), 13th edition, Page 579).) Diffusionism within anthropology is/was an attempt to understand the nature of culture in terms of the origin of culture traits and their spread from one society to another. Diffusionism as an anthropological school of thought started growing in the late 19th and the early 20th centuries. Diffusionism originated in the middle of the 19thcentury as a means of understanding the nature of the distribution of human culture across the world. Among the major concepts was whether human culture had evolved in a manner similar to biological evolution or whether culture spread from innovation centres by diffusion. Two schools of thought developed in the attempt to answer the concepts. There are different versions of diffusionist thought. Basically there is the theory that all cultures originated from one culture centre (heliocentric diffusion); and the less extreme theory that cultures originated from a limited number of culture centres (culture circles). The most extreme view was that there were a very limited number of locations, possibly only one, from which the most important culture traits diffused to the rest of the world. There is also the theory that each culture is influenced by others and that the process of diffusion is both contingent and arbitrary. Evolutionism, on the other hand, proposed the that all human beings share psychological traits that make them equally likely to innovate. According to the evolutionists, innovation in a culture is either continuous or triggered by variables that exist within a culture.
There have been 3 major theories of cultural diffusionism and multiple variations of these. At the turn of the 20th-century and shortly afterwards there was: (1) The German/Austrian-German tradition of diffusionism known as Kulturgeschichte/Kulturkreise. (2) The American tradition of diffusionism in the form of historical particularism. The American diffusionist school was led by Clark Wissler and Alfred Kroeber. Kroeber believed that diffusion always creates some change in the receiving culture. (3) The British tradition of diffusionism/hyperdiffusionism. The British school of hyperdiffusionism can be dated from 1911 with the publication of Elliot Smith's, Ancient Egyptians.The diffusionists, German, British, and American, believe that people are inherently uninventive and invariably prefer to borrow the inventions of another culture rather than develop ideas for themselves.
An antecedent of diffusionism is the philological studies of Max Müller. The concept of diffusionism originated in 18th-century philological tradition which speculated there were historical connections between all the languages of the Indo-European language group. Breakthrough studies were made in 1787 when William Jones, an English Orientalist and barrister serving as a judge in India, discovered similarities between Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin. In the early 19th-century, Wilhelm von Humboldt, a Prussian diplomat and brother of the explorer Alexander Baron von Humboldt, focused his philological investigations on the Basque language - a European but non-Indo-European language. Similarly to the earlier ideas of Johann Gottfried von Herder, Humboldt made a case for a close interrelation between language and culture. Circa the same time, Jacob Grimm (of the 'brother Grimm,' collectors of 'European' fairy tales), established the sound shifts which distinguish Germanic from other IndoEuropean languages. Also Franz Bopp took up the comparative study of Indo-European grammar. All these persons dealt with ideas which were later introduced into ethnology/anthropology as diffusionism. The development of theoretical ideas in linguistics has throughout the history of the discipline sooner or later influenced the development of related ideas in social and cultural anthropology. See also: "The social and political origins of German diffusionist ethnology." by Woodruff Smith in Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, Volume 14, Issue 2, April 1978, Pages 103–112. Part of abstract: "Diffusionism, an ethnological theory particularly dominant in Germany in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, can be shown to have had roots in the politics and major trends of social development of nineteenth-century Germany as well as in a variety of intellectual tendencies. ...."
Note: The Grimms' contribution to folklore research is recognised as somewhat ahistorical. The stories were not collected by extensive fieldwork throughout German-speaking Europe. They mostly gathered stories from a limited number of sources: mainly literary, acquaintances, and nonGerman (French). They reworked some of the stories into a German dialect.
19th-century and early 20th-century German anthropologists/ethnologists were considered to be extreme diffusionists. The British school of hyperdiffusionism eventually became the climax of the diffusionist movement. The German diffusionists did not believe that there is only one origin of culture (like the hyperdiffusionism of Smith and Perry regarding Egypt) but believed there used to be several cultural centers and cultural diffusion occurred from these different cultural circles (also known as Kulturkreise). The German school of thought on anthropology/ethnology was dominated by the Catholic clergy, who attempted to reconcile anthropological prehistory and cultural evolution with the Book of Genesis. One of the best known leaders in this attempt was Father Wilhelm Schmidt, Schmidt became a follower of Fritz Graebner, who was also working on a



world-wide scale with the theory of "culture-circles." Father Wilhelm Schmidt was one of the most prominent scholars of German diffusionism. Just like the British diffusionists, the German diffusionists also believed that people are in general uninventive and try to borrow from other cultures. Schmidt was a member of a missionary society and specialised in training missionaries for ethnological work. He took part in all the standard activities of an academic scholar and eventually gained a professorship at the University of Vienna. It has been pointed out that Schmidt's ethnology was built on theological assumptions. It assimilated world cultural history into theology and served as a defence of Catholicism within controversies in Europe. Its concepts did not go further to what theology provided.
The diffusionists faced numerous criticisms. The diffusionists could not give any convincing explanation of the fact why some cultures do not show any sign of the culture origins (like Egypt) of ideas, customs, material objects, or practices. (In their effort to clarify the fact that why some cultures do not possess any sign of the Egyptian culture, Smith and Perry maintained that some cultures have simply become degenerate.) Though the diffusionists take diffusion as an inevitable process, anthropologists found that societies can adjoin one another without exchanging cultural traits (dissemination not taking place). (See: Anthropology: A Global Perspective by Raymond Scupin and Christopher DeCorse (2012, 7th Edition, Page 284.) During the period between the end of WWI and the start of WWII diffusionism declined outside of Germany and Italy. For comparison, the idea that folk-tales found in the remotest areas of the world have all originated from one centre within a measurable historical period has been practically abandoned.
It is not reasonable to maintain that minor resemblances indicate counterparts (cultural borrowing ) in 2 or more cultures. As example: The coastal defense tables of Pylos are unlikely to have originated from a contemporary naval tablet of Ugarit; the similar situations adequately explain the likenesses. Similar situations/experiences are adequate to explain points of likeness. Resemblances in story themes can be more complex: The wanderings of Odysseus may have been adapted from the Gilgamesh epic. His triumph with the bow over rivals may have been borrowed from a Hittite story.
To prove a common source one must first prove similarity of purpose. This has not been addressed by the authors of Hamlet's Mill.
Perhaps a reasonable starting point for understanding modern knowledge of human migration is: First Migrants by Peter Bellwood (2013).
Neolithic migration and the plague
There is evidence for the existence of a prehistoric plague pandemic that likely contributed to the decline of Neolithic populations in Europe. Between 5,000 and 6,000 years ago, Neolithic farming communities in Europe dramatically declined. It is now thought that a new strain of plague was partially responsible to population decline at the beginning of the Bronze Age. A Danish research team discovered the oldest-known sample of plague bacteria in the 5,000-year-old genetic material of a 20-year-old woman found in a rural farming community in northwest Europe. It is suggested that the pathogen spread throughout Europe along trade routes rather than with mass migration. It is also suggested that there were multiple strains of plague in existence at the end of the Neolithic period. Massive human migrations from the Eurasian region into Europe are known to have occurred circa 3000 BCE. It has previously been suggested that these invaders brought the plague with them, wiping out the large settlements of Stone Age farmers when they arrived.
How the supposed astronomical monomyth was able to be successfully transmitted (and maintained) during a period of widespread plague and resulting decline of farming communities needs explanation.
Colin Renfrew's work disproving the Childean model of European Bronze Age diffusionism
The archaeologist/prehistorian Colin Renfrew, from the late 1960s onwards, was mainly instrumental in pulling apart the Childean model of prehistoric Europe in which cultural, technological and therefore social change had somehow 'diffused' out from regions that were claimed to be innovators in economic or cultural development. (See: From Stonehenge to Mycenae by John Barrett and Michael Boyd. 2019, Pages 6-7.)
The influence of Panbabylonism on Hertha von Dechend
The central tenet of Panbabylonism is that all mythology is astral mythology and the starting point of this whole system is Babylon, where it is found fully developed as early as 3000 BCE. Another central tenet is early Babylonian knowledge of precession. Myth similarities result from monogenesis (single origin) with subsequent diffusion through space and time by presumably cultural elites.
Aside from Leo Frobenius, another strong influential source for Hamlet's Mill would have been two Panbabylonian books by Alfred Jeremias listed in the Bibliography of Hamlet's Mill; Das Alte Testament im Lichte des Alten Orients (3rd Revised Edition 1916 (2 Volumes)); and Handbuch der Altorientalischen Geisteskultur (2nd Revised Edition, 1929). The authors of Hamlet's Mill claim the celestial locations are described by mundane referents. Symbolically the Earth is a Mill rotating on its axel/axis, which is displaced (= precession) and traces a circle in the sky. Its '4 corners' were never a terrestrial square, but the solstices and equinoxes (= the ecliptic) and these "corners" comprising the solstitial and equinoctial points move slowly through the zodiac (of 12 30-degree sectors). In his Das Alte Testament im Lichte des Alten Orients, Alfred Jeremias sets out such ideas as: (1) zodiacal world ages due to precession, (2) the change in world ages represented in myths, and (3) the celestial earth in the zodiac (ecliptic). Following the Panbabylonism of Alfred Jeremias the authors of Hamlet’s Mill identify ancient references to a 'quadrangular Earth' with four corners or pillars as a coded picture of "the ideal plane [= the ecliptic] going through the four points of the year, the equinoxes and the solstices." Lack of attribution of this idea to Alfred Jeremias is unsurprising as it makes a definite connection with an extreme and uncritical proponent of Panbabylonism. In the first edition of his Handbuch der altorientalischen Geisteskultur Alfred Jeremias proposed that not only Old World cultures relied on Babylonian astronomical science but also cultures in the New World.
The clearest and most forceful statement of zodiacal world ages/astrological world ages was propounded by the Panbabylonists; especially Alfred Jeremias. However, see: :Campion, Nicholas. (2004). 'The Sun is God.' (Culture and Cosmos, Volume 8, Numbers 1 and 2, Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter, Pages 45–56). (Note: Excellent investigation of the modern origin of astronomical 'world ages'.)
It has been remarked that von Dechend also seems to have been influenced by Jungian ideas but this does not appear to be correct. However, there are several points of correspondence. The Swiss mystic, psychiatrist, and psychotherapist Carl Jung (1875-1961) was a modern proponent of ancient knowledge of precession and/or a system of zodiacal world ages. (Another was the French occultist René Adolphe Schwaller de Lubicz (1887–1961). In his Sacred Science: The King of Pharaonic Theocracy (1961), René Adolphe Schwaller de Lubicz claimed knowledge of precession in ancient Egypt.) In his Aion (1951, also in Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Volume 9, Part 2) Carl Jung popularised the concept of astrological ages. The original 2 Swiss editions had different subtitles: "Researches into the History of Symbols" and then "Contributions to the
Symbolism of the Self." In 1958 Jung wrote (Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies (also see Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Volume 10, Pages 311-312.): I am fully aware of the risk I am taking in proposing to communicate my views concerning certain contemporary events, which seem to me important, to those patient enough to hear me. ... It is not presumption that drives me, but my conscience as a psychiatrist that bids me fulfill my duty and prepare those few who will hear me for coming events which are in accord with the end of an era. As



we know from ancient Egyptian history, there are symptoms of psychic changes that always appear at the end of one Platonic month and at the beginning of another. They are, it seems, changes in the constellation of the psychic dominants, of the archetypes or "Gods" as they used to be called, which bring about, or accompany, long-lasting transformations of the collective psyche. This transformation started within the historical tradition and left traces behind within it, first in the transition of the Age of Taurus to that of Aries, and then from Aries to Pisces, whose beginning coincides with the rise of Christianity. We are now nearing that great change which may be expected when the spring-point enters Aquarius. ... I am, to be quite frank, concerned for all those that are unprepared by the events in question and disconcerted by their incomprehensible nature. ... I undertake this thankless task in the expectation that my chisel will make no impression on the hard stone it meets." The "month" referred to here is the misinterpretation of the "Platonic month" for a "zodiacal age." In his manuscript folio Liber Novus (Page 306, Note 236) begun circa 1910/1915 Jung asked himself, "How can I fathom what will happen during the next eight hundred years, up to the time when the One begins his rule? I am speaking only of what is to come." It has been noted that the "eight hundred year" period is associated with the coniunctiones maximae of Saturn and Jupiter, which recur in an 800-year cycle. (See: cf. Aion, Collected Works of C. G. Jung, 9ii, 82, 96ff). A Saturn–Jupiter conjunction is imaged occurring in Gemini on the initial folio page of Jung's manuscript Liber Novus. It is also suggested in the Aion.) Carl Jung proposed a speculative theory of mythology with his universal archetypes of the collective unconscious. Jung's theories have long been derided in scholarship on mythology, and the research data have been shown not to support his claims of universals. Indeed, the resounding refutation of universals has invalidated Jung's theories of mythology.
Though von Dechend realised the Panbabylonians had not approached the subject of the zodiac, the solstices and equinoxes, and precession, in a rigorous historic manner - knowledge of all concepts did not exist in the 3rd-millennium BCE - that did not prevent her from repeating the same. There is of course a connection between astronomy, and religion, and mythology, in ancient Mesopotamia, but not as proposed by the Panbabylonists and the extreme Panbabylonism of Hertha von Dechend.
For the construct of an ancient quadrilateral "ideal plane" of earth as a modern concept see the critical discussion of the claim (made in Hamlet's Mill) by John Didier in his In and Outside the Square, Volume III, Sino-Platonic Papers, Number 192, 2009. John Didier also points out there is no evidence that the proto-Chinese conceived of "mythical earth" at all. (See the (English-language) book review of Didier's In and Outside the Square, by Michael Saso in China Review International, Volume 16, Number 4, 2009, Pages 491-493. John Didier has lectured on East Asia at Princeton University (1996) and Rutgers University-New Brunswick (1997). His 1998 PhD dissertation was, Way of Transformation: Universal Unity in Warring States through Sung China.)
Hertha von Dechend published very little material. Her PhD dissertation Die kultishe und mythische Bedeutung des Schweins in Indonesien und
Ozeanien (= The significance of pigs in myth and culture in Indonesia and Oceania) (Frankfurt: Goethe Universitat, 1939 (but I have seen the date given as 1943)) remains unpublished. It appears that it was during her PhD work that she first concluded that only if Oceanic mythology was given an astronomical interpretation could it be understood. Her Habilitation (completed in 1960) was Der Mythos von gebauten Welt als Ausdrucksform archaischer Naturwissenschaft. In 1973 and 1977 she published 2 short articles on the subject of ancient cosmology. (On of these was "Bemerkungen zum Donnerkeil [Comments on the Thunderbolt]." in: Prismata (Festschrift für Willy Hartner), 1977; Pages 95ff.) Another, littleknown, article by Hertha von Dechend is "Il concetto di simmetria nelle culture arcaiche." in: La Simmetria, edited by Evandro Agnazzi [sometimes given as Agazzi] (1973, Pages 361-397(399?)). The publication in which the paper appears is a collection of 1973 conference papers presented in Venice. Giorgio de Santillana published substantial material on the history of science. Yet another little-known article by von Dechend is "Erinnerungen an die Friihzeit des Instituts." In: Ad Radices edited by Anton von Gotstedter (1994, Pages 3-11).
According to Hamlet's Mill and Panbabylonism the core of myth is to be sought in an intellectual interpretation of mythology. Myth is astronomical allegory and its allegories contain intellectual information. Falling back on this generalisation is inadequate to fill the gaps in the lack of clear proofs. Hamlet's Mill, like Panbabylonism, is weighed down in speculation and improbabilities. The themes of Panbabylonism are continued – once again in an uncritical manner. The hypothetical character of many interpretations is not identified. Unlike the Panbabylonists, von Dechend never answered her critics.
Astrology
Interestingly, the authors of Hamlet's Mill put an emphasis on astrology. "The greatest gap between archaic thinking and modern thinking is in the use of astrology [but an astrology whose form was completely unrelated to the common astrology practiced today]. ... It gave the lingua franca of the past. Its knowledge was cosmic correspondences ...." (Hamlet's Mill, Page 74.) "It is now known that astrology has provided man with his continuing lingua franca through the centuries." (Hamlet's Mill, Page 345.) This too is traceable to Panbabylonism.
However, astrology was the locus classicus for cultural contact between the Near East and the West from antiquity through the Middle Ages and after.
The 2nd volume of Franz Kugler's Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel (1909/1910) and its demolition of an early Babylonian scientific astronomy forced the Panbabylonists to adopt new tactics. In 1909 some key Panbabylonists (including Alfred Jeremias) stated their intention to now only examine whether the astrological foundations of Panbabylonism were better assured than its astronomical ones. However, in his Im Bannkreis Babels (1910) Franz Kugler showed that Panbabylonism is just as unsound in its astrological as in its astronomical foundations.
The Methodology of Hamlet's Mill and the Methodology of Panbabylonism
The supposed monomyth was not maintained anywhere on the globe. No example of the supposed astronomical monomyth is able to be identified as a working system in current use. The such a supposedly dominant global system could lapse everywhere is odd to say the least. The argument made is that traces of it are found all over the globe. However, the authors of Hamlet's Mill are simply following the method and weaknesses of the German Panbabylonian school.
Panbabylonism is now regarded as discredited speculation. The Panbabylonists were/are criticised for their:
(1) Disregard for textual evidence.
(2) Excessive speculation (postulates and assumptions) and absence of rigorous evidence.
(3) Abuse of the argument from analogy.
(4) Wide use of secondary sources.
(5) Wide use of antiquated translations.



(6) Use of a preconceived chronology of Babylonian civilization.
(7) Uncritically argued ideas about an alleged Babylonian "Weltanschauung (i.e., astral philosophy)."
(8) Inability to provide any directly supporting statements contained in texts (i.e., the Panbabylonists could only argue their tenets were implied in widely divergent material).
(9) Overstressing "parallels" and similarities.
(10) Far-fetched interpretations and combinations.
It is uncontroversial that Hamlet's Mill can be criticised for points (2), (4), (5), (8), (9), and (10).
The influence of the German-Austrian diffusionism on Hertha von Dechend
Several different groups of diffusionists and Kulturkreise schools emerged in Germany, each with their own characteristics. The German diffusionists held a low opinion of human inventiveness. This was shared by von Dechend. Von Dechend failed to understand the issues of common inventions rather than distinctive inventions (i.e., distinctive stylistic differences). Von Dechend presumed there are distinctively different ethnic 'minds' and that this had implications for inventiveness.
Diffusionism was mostly a Germanic specialisation with centres in the great museum cities of Berlin and Vienna. In the 1920s, 1930s and 1950s the Vienna culture-historical school was the dominant school of thought in Austrian academic ethnology. It was centred around Wilhelm Schmidt (1868-1954). Schmidt was a strict opponent of cultural evolutionism inspired by Darwinism and hypothesized a primordial culture characterized by monotheism, monogamy, and private property. In his endeavour to prove his theory of primordial monotheism (Urmonotheismus), he engaged other members of his religious (Societas Verbi Divini) to conduct fieldwork to gather ethnological evidence for his hypotheses. Peoples believed to be contemporary representatives of this Urkultur - those of short stature living in marginal areas, such as the Central African pygmy populations became the central focus of research. Father Paul Schebesta (1887-1967) was one of the missionaries who conducted intensive anthropological field research, first with the Malaysian Semang and then, in 1920-1930 and 1934-35, the pygmies of the Ituri region.
Diffusionist research was quite sophisticated. Its ideas and the Kulturkreise (cultural areas) program remained vigorous in Germany and Austria until the 1950s.
The German (German-Austrian) school of diffusionism was founded by Fritz Ratzel (1844-1904). Ratzel explained similarities in human societies as a result of historical contact and cultural borrowing. He justified this position by arguing that humankind had limited capacities for invention and was inclined to attachment to traditions. (That humankind had limited capacities for invention was a theme picked up and constantly reiterated by von Dechend in her MIT seminar notes. This was a key reason for von Dechend supporting the hyper-diffusionism of Elliot Smith. Elliot Smith held the view that any type of invention could only happen once. Hence the spread of an invention from a single location.) Other prominent proponents were Leo Frobenius (1873-1938), Fritz Graebner (1877-1934), and Wilhelm Schmidt (1868-1954). (The German kultukreise school is ultimately traced to Friedrich Ratzel, not to Leo Frobenius, as von Dechend would have it. Frobenius had been a student of Ratzel. Frobenius's early proposals were made without suitable evidence.)
Ratzel was probably the first investigator to divide the world into what is termed 'culture areas.' Leo Frobenius greatly extended his method and theory. Frobenius, a self-trained African explorer and eventually a museum ethnologist, focused on looking for parallels in cultural development worldwide. His idea of 'culture circles' (Kulturkreise), involved great culture areas which in some cases spread across the globe and overlapped those which had existed before. The concept of culture circles dominated German and Austrian anthropology from the 1890s to the 1930s.
Wilhelm Schmidt was a strict opponent of cultural evolutionism inspired by Darwinism and instead hypothesized a primordial culture characterised by monotheism, monogamy, and private property. In his endeavour to prove his theory of primordial monotheism (Urmonotheismus), he engaged other members of his religious (Societas Verbi Divini) to conduct fieldwork to gather ethnological evidence for his hypotheses. Peoples believed to be contemporary representatives of this Urkultur--those of short stature living in marginal areas, such as the Central African pygmy populations--became the central focus of research. Paul Schebesta (1887-1967) was one of the missionaries who conducted intensive anthropological field research. He was the first to study the Malaysian Semang and then, in 1920-1930 and 1934-1935, the pygmies of the Ituri region. (Out of this came Schmidt's, Der Ursprungder Gottesidea (The Origin of the Idea of God) which was published in 12 volumes between 1926 and 1955.) The German-Austrian school (known as the cultural historical school, or the culture-circle school) proposed that culture complexes diffused in totality through actual movement or migration of people. The German-Austrian diffusionists assumed that similarities between cultures (even when separated by vast distances) was achieved by diffusion/migration (i.e., historical contact). This belief was maintained until the feasibility of any historical contact was firmly disproven. The German-Austrian diffusionists did not take separatedness by vast distances between cultures into account. Diffusion was believed to have occurred between cultures that displayed similarity. This explains the silence of Hamlet's Mill on the issue of diffusion/migration. (Wilhelm Schmidt and Wilhelm Koppers were the founders of the Austrian school of diffusion. The Roman Catholic priest Wilhelm Schmidt (1868-1954) was a philologist turned ethnologist. Wilhelm Koppers (1886-1961, a Roman Catholic priest and cultural anthropologist) was Professor of Ethnology (Völkerkunde) and President of the Institute of Ethnology at the University of Vienna. See his (English-language) essay: "Diffusion: Transmission and Acceptance." (Yearbook of Anthropology, 1955, Pages 169-181).) Schmidt was a priest in the Catholic missionary order Societas Verbi Divini (Society of the Divine Word) (SVD). Schmidt's research was rooted in in Catholicism. Koppers was a close collaborator of Schmidt and a member of the same Catholic order.
According to Eduard Stucken and Hugo Winckler (apparent) similarities in myths are to be explained by diffusion/migration however far apart geographically. Eduard Stucken does not deal at all with the difficulties of transmission to remote geographic regions. Also, the issue of preastronomical mythology is not addressed.
Von Dechend does discuss the Evolutionist School of Anthropology and the Diffusionist School of Anthropology in "Einführung in die Archaische Kosmologie." (Pages 7-31; and "Kulturhistorische Ethnologie und vergleichende Mythologie." (Pages 31-47). In: Einführung in die Archaische Kosmologie, Vorlesungen im Wintersemester 1976/77, Hertha von Dechend. (The publication is available from Differenz-Verlang\Franz Krojer, München.) Von Dechend unsurprisingly favours diffusionism.
From Hamlet’s Mill (1969, Page 71): "Mistaking cultural history for a process of gradual evolution, we have deprived ourselves of every reasonable insight into the nature of culture. It goes without saying that the still more modern habit of replacing "culture" by "society" has blocked the last narrow path to understanding history. Our ignorance not only remained vast, but became pretentious as well." It appears here that Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend have given support to Germanic ethnology. Diffusionists believed that cultural development was not



unilineal (i.e., all aspects of a culture moved in a 'single line' from the most primitive to the most sophisticated). Diffusionists held that a culture with a simple technology might have a highly sophisticated religious system (or astronomical system).

The weaknesses of the kulturkreise school
While diffusion is an acknowledged mechanism for change, but not the sole mechanism. As the sole mechanism it denies independent invention and local adaptation to the environment. Simply, it denies human inventiveness. Similar natural environments in different parts of the world are inevitably inhabited by people with divergent cultures. The "cause" of each cultural assemblage is wholly capricious. Importantly it is the natural environment areas that are decisive by way of the "techno-environmental" interaction.
Von Dechend held that independent invention was an insignificant and rare event. It has never been established that independent invention was an insignificant and rare event. The archaeology of the New World has shown that independent invention has occurred on a large scale.
Not dealt with by kulturkreise ideas is centre and boundary change with the passage of time. Also, the greatest weakness of the kulturkreise scheme was its supporters could never explain why diffusion and migration take place. The final blow to the kulturkreise theory came from archaeology. Excavations failed to produce evidence for it. As example: "To put it negatively, there were not Kulturkreis-like movements across Bering Strait of specific traditions, physical types, or linguistic stocks from Asia that then spread out along specific routes in the New World." ("Men Out of Asia; as Seen From the Northwest Yukon." by Richard McBeath (Anthropological Papers of the University of Alaska, Volume 7, Number 2, May 1959, Pages 41-70, Page 53).)
Kulturkreise, though it involved fieldwork, was basically a museum methodology - based on the classification of collected cultural items. Typologized artifacts, detached from their cultural ands social context, were studied in museums. The kulturkreise school is now effectively defunct, even in Europe. In attempting to establish its correctness it has worked mainly to prove itself wrong.
Historical background to German-Austrian diffusionism
The German School of diffusion is also known as the Vienna School of diffusion. However, the Austrian was a variant of German diffusionism.
In Germany diffusionism was known as the "culture historical method" (Kulturhistorische Methode or Kulturkreislehre). The 1904 meeting of the Berliner Gesellschaft (Berlin Society for anthropology, Ethnology and Prehistory) consolidated diffusionist ethnology as the dominant force in German anthropology. At this meeting Fritz Graebner and Bernhard Ankermann issued the original declarations of the so-called "difusionist revolt." Their presented papers were on the Kulturkreise (cultural areas) and Kulturschichten (cultural layers) of Oceania and Africa. (See the papers published by Graebner and Ankermann in 1905 in the Berliner Gesellschaft journal, the Zeitschrift für Ethnologie. They came from junior anthropologists/curators at the Berlin Völkerkunde museum to prominence.) The correct framework for analysis in ethnology and prehistory was believed to be Kulturkreise. Because of his poor treatment of evidence, Graebner and Ankermann rejected conclusions by Frobenius. During the following period to WWI German ethnology was reshaped by the emergence of several different groups of diffusionists, each with its own particular ideas. The trend by German ethnologists towards diffusionist models became pronounced in the decades following WWI.
The explanation by "original community," first applied by Theodor Benfey to the widely distributed parallel forms of folklore and fairy tales. Originating in a favourable locality (India), these tales were first accepted by the primarily related (Indo-Germanic) peoples, then continued to grow while retaining the common primary traits, and ultimately radiated over the entire earth. This mode of explanation was first adapted to the wide distribution of the hero myths by Rudolf Schubert. Theodor Benfey (born 1809, Nörten, near Göttingen, Germany - died 1881, Göttingen), was a German scholar of Sanskrit and comparative linguistics (philologist) who made important contributions to Sanskrit studies. He was the son of a Jewish trader/merchant from Nörten in Lower Saxony, and 1 of 7 children. He was involved initially with research in classical languages. After brilliant studies at Göttingen he spent a year at Munich and afterwards became a teacher at Frankfurt am Main (1829?/1830–1832), and in 1834 he became a Privatdozent at the University of Göttingen where he began teaching classical-language studies (and only later Sanskrit and Comparative Grammar). (Benfey received his preliminary training at the gymnasium in Göttingen, which he left at the age of 16 to attend the University of Göttingen. As a university student he devoted himself to classical philology, and remained in Göttingen - with the exception of the year 1827, spent at Munich - until 1830. On October 24, 1828, he received the degree of Ph.D., and the year following (1829) became Privatdozent.) In 1848 he became an assistant professor (without salary) and was appointed professor in 1862. Benfey's teaching covered a wide range within his chosen limits. In addition to his regular work he lectured on Indian antiquities, on the Avesta, and also gave courses in ethnography from the linguistic point of view (1843), and in Bengali and Hindustani (1863-64). His several attempts to gain a more profitable position elsewhere were in vain. He established a periodical, "Orient und Occident," in 1862, and it was discontinued in 1866. He left the Jewish faith in 1848, and with his family joined the Evangelical Church. He died in 1881 after a short illness.
The diffusion theory of migration, or borrowing, sets out that individual myths originate from definite peoples (especially the Babylonians) and are accepted by other peoples through oral tradition (commerce and traffic) or through literary influences. The diffusion theory of migration and borrowing can be readily shown to be merely a modification of Theodor Benfey's theory. India competed with Babylonia for identification as the original home of myths. The competing view that tales did not radiate from a single point, but travelled over and across the entire inhabited globe was the idea of the interdependence of mythological structures, an idea which was generalized by Julius Braun as the basic law of the nature of the human mind: The concept being: Nothing new is ever discovered as long as it is possible to copy. The theory of elemental ideas, was strenuously advocated by Adolf Bauer in the 1880s, and was unconditionally declined by Winckler and Stucken, who maintained the migration theory.
Naturgeschichte der Sage [Natural History of Legends] by Julius Braun (2 Volumes, 1864-1865) attempted to be a "key to all mythologies," tracing all religious ideas, legends, and systems back to their (believed) common family tree and primary root. Julius Braun (born 1825, Karlsruhe - died 1869, Munich) was a German historian (and philologist?) with an interest in art, culture and religion. He was born and received his early education in Karlsruhe. He then studied at the universities of Heidelberg and Berlin, at first theology, but later philology and art history. He finished his formal studies in 1848, and passed the test for teachers in Karlsruhe that same year. From 1850 to 1858, he undertook an extensive study tour which brought him to Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor, Rome, Paris and London. At first a Privatdozent in the University of Heidelberg, he afterwards became a professor at the University of Tübingen for a short time. Wanting to reach a wider audience and find a more stimulating academic environment he then went to Munich, where he lectured in the Academy of Arts. There he gained a circle of close friends among the educated, but not the academic position he hoped for. He was kept busy with his writings, and travelled to Rome again briefly. He died of a fever. In his books and lectures he maintained the view that the really fundamental principles of art and religion were derived from the Egyptians, and were transmitted, through the Semites, Greeks, and Romans, to the Germanic and other northern peoples.



"[Wilhelm] Schmidt was born in Westphalia, he was the founder of the SVD’s (Societas Verbi Divini) mission school in St. Gabriel near Mödling and elsewhere. – By 1928/29, two new institutes thereby emerged at Vienna University: the Institute of Ethnology (Institut für Völkerkunde) and the Institute of (physical) Anthropology (Institut für Anthropologie). The first institute’s director for ethnology was F. Wilhelm Koppers (1886 1961), F. Wilhelm Schmidt's associate and close academic colleague. Together Schmidt and Koppers had devised the so-called Vienna School of "culture circle theory” which—with the exception of the Nazi period—characterised this Vienna institute’s academic orientation until the early 1950s. This theologically informed research approach assumed the basic notion that the "most primitive" peoples stood closest to divine creation, thus providing evidence for "primeval monotheism". So-called "culture circles” were reconstructed based on questions regarding the origins and diffusion of material objects. Nevertheless, several empirical works by Schmidt and Koppers as well as by many of their disciples (e.g. Gusinde, Schebesta, Haekel, Henninger) contained some useful and relevant insights." (ksa.univie.ac.at/en/department/history/) The immediate post WWII era was the final stage of the so-called Vienna School. It had reached a theoretical methodical dead-end and could no longer be supported. In 1956 the "Vienna School" approach was finally declared obsolete and abandoned. Leading players in this were Josef Haekel and Robert Heine-Geldern.
Von Dechend and diffusionism
Diffusion/migration is dealt with in a cavalier manner by von Dechend/Hamlet's Mill. The structure of diffusion/migratory patterns (a process or event) is not discussed, or even considered. Was there planning? How was the astronomical monomyth transmitted from the Bronze Age Near East to the rest of the world? And who transmitted the astronomical monomyth? What preconditions made this type of cultural exchange possible? (What did people know and care about other societies?) Did diffusion/migration proceed along well-defined routes to specific locations? Is diffusion of the monomyth a part of people movement or is its transference a part of exploration? Was it a world of constant mutual contact and exchange of ideas?
The rate of diffusion of the monomyth is not attempted/discussed. Issues such as the possible need for reinforcement of the form and content of the monomyth are ignored (i.e., not mentioned). The monomyth remaining unaltered/localised. Not explained is why was it so readily accepted on a world-wide basis. Also: What about "dead ends" for the transmission and accepted of the monomyth? Were there no rejections?
Ignored by von Dechend: Occurring circa 2800 BCE, was the dispersal and migration of 5 major language groups in 5 different parts of the world, Bantu (Africa), Indo-Aryan (Near East and Europe), Uto-Aztecan (North America), Austronesian (Southeast Asia), and Gé-Pano-Carib (South America). This date is approximately the boundary between the middle and late Holocene climate regimes, moving from warmer and dryer to cooler and wetter conditions.
(1) Leo Frobenius
Leo Frobenius coined the term "culture-circles" (kulturkreise). The first presentations of this ideas were: Der Ursprung der afrikanischen Kulteren (1898), and "The West African Culture Circle." his first theoretically oriented article (Von Dechend has 1902 but 1898 is the correct date). Frobenius believed that culture was independent from its individual bearers. He did not believe that African people invented their own culture. He believed that it had originally spread with migrations from Asia. (It has been commented that Frobenius felt contempt for black Africans.)
(2) Arthur Kroeber
The American ethnologist Arthur Kroeber (1876-1960) coined the term "stimulus diffusion" [or transcultural diffusion] in a paper published in the American Anthropologist in 1940. It proposes that it is the idea that travels. (See: "Stimulus Diffusion." by Arthur Kroeber (American Anthropologist, New Series, Volume 42, Number 1, January-March, 1940, Pages 1-20.) "Stimulus Diffusion" proved to be a very influential concept. Von Dechend endorsed this idea. Kroeber distinguished between invention by (1) stimulus diffusion, (2) reduction-segregation, and (3) displacement.
(3) Grafton Elliot Smith, William. James Perry, and Rendell Harris
"... [T]he scholars who first worked out the true sequence of cultures, and realized the far reaching, overpowerful (sic) influence of the Ancient Near East have been British: Grafton Elliot Smith, W. James Perry, and W. H. R. Rivers." (See: Introduction to Ancient Cosmology (1966, Page 28).)
In the 1920s a British group of diffusionists, led by Grafton Elliot Smith (1871-1937), William James Perry (1887(1868?)-1949), and James Rendel Harris (1852-1941, a Biblical scholar and curator) argued that only one civilization was responsible for all cultural development. Grafton Elliot Smith was a distinguished anatomist who became professor of anatomy in 1919 at University College London. Perry became reader in cultural anthropology in 1924 (actual appointment, August 1923) at University College London. They were amateur archaeologists/anthropologists. They believed that the civilization fitting their theory was ancient Egypt and that ideas were spread throughout the world from ancient Egypt, by voyagers who were seeking precious jewels. This Pan-Egyptian theory was most usually called the Manchester (the city where Smith held an institutional position before moving to University College London), or heliocentric (sun-centred) school of thought. The metaphor of the sun suggested that all cultures radiated from only a single source. They held that civilization only arose once - and this was in Egypt - and then spread across the globe. These two English "diffusionist" writers replaced Panbabylonism with an equally all-embracing PanEgyptionism. The 'heliocentric' school flourished during the years between 1911 and 1934. It promoted the view that all higher forms of culture spread from Egypt along with solar religion. William Perry (British geographer and anthropologist, 1868-1949) was noted for his diffusionist theory of cultural development. According to him Megalithic culture was transmitted to the rest of the world from Egypt. He frequently collaborated with Grafton Elliot Smith. He was also a convinced Heliocentrist. His books include: The Megalithic Culture of Indonesia (1918), The Children of the Sun: a Study in the Early History of Civilization (1923), The Origin of Magic and Religion (1923), and The Growth of
Civilization (1924). Elliot Smith was combative in print. The term diffusionism originates with the 'heliocentric' school. Samuel Hooke (18741968) seems to have been a prominent supporter of the 'heliocentric school.' As it favoured Egypt as the cultural centre it was a rival to Panbabylonism.
In England at least, diffusionist works were treated respectfully and diffusionists were taken seriously through to the mid 1920s. Unlike the Panbabylonists their adherents were very few.
Changes in funding support by the Rockefeller foundation contributed to the decline of this diffusionist school. Ultimately, scientific progress in archaeology in the 1940s proved beyond doubt that the Egypt of circa 4000 BCE could not have been the source of all human culture, and gave the coup de grâce to British hyper-diffusionism
The German anthropologist and Africanist, Hermann Baumann (1902-1972) was a diffusionist who believed an Asiatic (Near Eastern) HighCulture swept from the East across Sudan superimposing its ideas on native culture. Von Dechend appears to have believed in this idea. "... [F]or the ancient founders of [African] states we have to look ... in deeper strata (the so-called moon-kings in the East." (Introduction to Cosmology: A



Preliminary Reconnaissance by Hertha von Dechend and Giorgio de Santillana, (1961, Page 4.) By the descriptor, "moon-kings in the East" I presume she means 'moon-god kings' of Sumer and Akkad.
Like other diffusionists, von Dechend adopted the belief that the main function was to discover patterns, and gave little attention to formulating clear statements of the general principles of cultural diffusion.
Diffusionist and kulturkreise issues
Also obviously influential with von Dechend were the kulturkreise (cultural areas) ideas. Ratzel's Formengedanke ('criteria of forms') and Frobenius' addition to it (called Geographical Statistics) were combined within the investigative strategy of the Kultukreise School. The German museum curator, geographer, and ethnologist Fritz Graebner (1877-1934) became the principal leader of the Kulturkreise School. In his influential book, Methode der Ethnology (1911) he set out its methodological principles. It was the most complete methodological statement of Kulturkreise, which Graebner considered the method of ethnology. Graebner set out the technique of recovering older cultural configurations through analysis of patterned distribution of cultural elements. The 2 basic rules set out by Graebner (Methode der Ethnology) (also mistakenly cited as Die Methode der Ethnologie) were:
(1) Criterion of Form. Similarities between 2 culture elements which do not automatically arise out of nature, material purpose of traits or objects, are to be interpreted as resulting from diffusion, regardless of the distance separating the 2 similarities.
(2) Criterion of Quality. The likelihood of a historical relationship between 2 culture elements increases as the number of additional culture elements showing similarities increases i.e., several similarities prove more than a single one.
Note: Handbuch der Methode der kulturhistorischen Ethnologie by Wilhelm Schmidt (with contributions by Wilhelm Koppers) (1937) purports to bring Graebner's Methode der Ethnologie (1911) up to date and to dispel misunderstandings with his exposition.
A reason why von Dechend avoided mention of Panbabylonism
The resumption of Panbabylonism (also known as the Leipzig School, and its approach to the complexity of Babylonian symbolism and its astral approach to mythology) occurred in the 1960s due to Hertha von Dechend ( a disciple of Frobenius), and the historian of science Giorgio de Santillana. They aimed to trace the common foundation of myths and fables of all people.
Franz Krojer states that in conversation von Dechend denied she wanted to revive Panbabylonism in Hamlet's Mill. This is rather amazing as the basic thesis of the book is the global diffusion of Babylonian astromythology, specifically. Von Dechend stated she fully realised the result of Panbabylonism was an academic suspicion of any claim for an astronomical interpretation in ancient myths and religions. Also, that this is a reason for 20th-century scholars rejecting the astral significance of Mithraic iconography. (See: "Der Riss zwischen den beiden Kulturen" ["The rift between the two cultures"] In: Franz Krojer (with a contribution by Thomas Schmidt): Die Präzision der Präzession, Illigs mittelalterliche Phantomzeit aus astronomischer Sicht. [The precision of precession, Illig's medieval phantom time from an astronomical point of view.] (2003).) It is worth noting that Phyllis Ackerman, an expert on Iranian art and a proponent of an astral interpretation of mythology, also related a similar story in her essay "Stars and Stories." In: Anon. (Editor). Myth and Mythmaking. (Pages 90-102). Due to the excessive and erroneous claims of Panbabylonism, especially the extravagant Panbabylonism of Alfred Jeremias, there was a continuing academic suspicion of any claim for an astronomical interpretation in ancient myths and religions.
In a seminar in the early 1960s de Santillana and von Dechend stated their argument is developed from a re-examination of the findings of Nineteenth Century scholars. However, Hamlet's Mill is mostly a collection of Panbabylonist theories without the scholarship. The roots of the German Star-Myth School and Panbabylonism lie in the late 19th-century. However, though their material is used the actual 'schools' are not specifically mentioned. Perhaps this is in part due to the heavy reliance of Hamlet's Mill on (dated) philological arguments
There was a strong tendency of 19th- and early 20th-century mythologists to look for a single 'key' or method that would reveal what myth is all about.
Both the Star-Myth School and Panbabylonism argued that the mythology of the whole world originated as a system of sun, moon, star, and skylore that was developed by the Babylonians circa 3000 BCE. This is a broad star-myth concept. Von Dechend perhaps felt that these 2 schools could be left unmentioned because within her scheme mythology was a world-wide code language for precession. While the Star-Myth School and Panbabylonism believed that precession was known to early humankind, it did not form a central explanation of mythology. Keeping the inheritance of Frobenius, von Dechend has utilised elements of the Star-Myth school and Panbabylonism with her own precessional interpretation of mythology. (Without this inheritance von Dechend would had lacked the 'building blocks' for her ideas.) It is not indicated that de Santillana was involved in any 'discovery' of precessional mythology. However, he was sympathetic to an astronomical interpretation of mythology. De Santillana, in Hamlet's Mill, credits von Dechend's 'discovery' of an astronomical explanation (the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn) to account for the high numbers of temple platforms on Necker and Tubuai as being persuasive for him in accepting an astronomical interpretation of cultural history. With von Dechend, precession is substituted for the 19th-century and early 20th-century star-myth explanations of the content of mythology. This explanation has been overlooked by previous commentators.

Godfrey Higgins' Anacalypsis
"A certain Mr. Higgins, about whom I am otherwise ignorant but who has written, around 1837, as (sic) fascinating book of two volumes, entitled "Ahacalypsis" (sic) wrote (Reprint 1927, I 55): "We shall never have an ancient history worthy of the perusal of man (sic) [men] of commonsense, till we cease treating poems as history, and send back such personages as Hercules, Theseus, Bacchus etc., to the heavens, whence their history is taken, and whence they never descended to the earth." (Introduction to Ancient Cosmology by Hertha von Dechend (1979).)
Godfrey Higgins (1772-1833), was a British archaeologist, Freemason and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, humanist, social reformer, and author. He was remembered by his parish as a "political radical, reforming county magistrate and idiosyncratic historian of religions." His 2volume book Anacalypsis (1833-1836) was particularly influential. It was one of the earliest (detailed) comparisons of Christian and pagan



parallels. Godfrey Higgins believed that a high civilization had flourished prior to all historical records. Higgins sets out that an ancient advanced civilisation once ruled over the entire world. The dominance of the school of solar mythology is evident in Anacalypsis. Also, Robert Taylor's influence has been identified. In 1829 Robert Taylor published a book on comparative religion titled, The Diegesis; Being a Discovery of the Origin, Evidences, and Early History of Christianity, Never Yet Before or Elsewhere So Fully and Faithfully Set Forth. In 1830-1831 Robert Taylor published, The Devil's Pulpit: Or Astro-Theological Sermons (2 volumes).
It is worth noting that Godfrey Higgins was influenced by the French astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly (1736-1793).
In 1964(1965?) Abe Aronow purchased the 2 volumes of Anacalypsis at a book sale at the Dartmouth Library. He left them on Giorgio de Santillana's office desk at MIT. Both Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend knew about Higgins' Anacalypsis prior to receiving Aronow's copy but had not reviewed the actual text. Aronow recalls a telephone conversation with de Santillana regarding the Higgins' volumes De Santillana called Aronow in Hanover (New Hampshire) after the volumes were left on his desk. De Santillana said he knew of the books and that there was an 1833 copy at the Houghton Library at Harvard, but he had never looked into it. Aronow believes that de Santillana (and von Hechend) did not believe appreciate the nature and scope of Higgins' volumes until he perused the volumes procured for him. Some years later Harald Reiche sent the volumes back to Aronow. In a letter to Abe Aronow dated July 22, 1991, Hertha von Dechend writes: " ... Very many thanks for your letter, the articles, and for the offer to let me have your copy of Anacalypsis; but Reiche has, indeed, found a copy for me several years ago."
The author of Anacalypsis identifies and discusses similar (religious) beliefs held world-wide. Godfrey Higgins was convinced by his 20/30 years of research that a high culture had existed prior to all historical records. He believed that a prehistoric universal religion existed and all later creeds and doctrines sprang from it. He also believed this religion possessed accurate knowledge of astronomical phenomena. (Godfrey Higgins used precession as a method of investigation. He placed the beginning of the 'Age of Taurus' at 4400 BCE.) Higgins proposed ancient knowledge of: (1) precession of the equinoxes (causing displacement of festivals), (2) an equally divided 12-part zodiac, (3) determination of precessional rate (the rate of the precessional cycle), (4) knowledge of a precessional great year, and (5) astronomical mythology/allegory with cyclic content (i.e., occurrences of cyclic cataclysms and upheavals). Higgins addressed the theme of cycles in some detail. A basic theme of the book is that there is a universal basis to all languages and religions and Godfrey Higgins sought to identify the common thread. Godfrey Higgins hypothesized that all religions had sprung from one common origin, which he sought to trace, and he further suggested the existence of a secret religious order, that he termed Pandeism, that once held sway across much of the globe. (Hertha von Dechend mentioned Godfrey Higgins and his book Anacalypsis in her 1979 seminar. The authors also use it, at least once, in Hamlet's Mill (Page 256): Finally in Higgins' Anacalypsis there is a quote, without the ancient source but reasonably reliable: "Ganges which is also called Po." The book is listed on page 466 of the bibliography.) The influence of Higgins' concept of an ancient world-wide secret religious order sharing knowledge, on the similar idea expressed in Hamlet's Mill that a secret world-wide net of scholars existed and shared coded astronomical information should not be overlooked. Also, in Anacalypsis Higgins touches on the theme of zodiacal world ages
(http://somerationalism.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/quality-of-sources-godfrey-higgins-pt-1.html): "Godfrey Higgins' main written work is titled Anacalypsis; An Attempt to Draw Aside the Veil of the Saitic Isis; or an Inquiry into the Origin of Languages, Nations and Religions. It was
published in two volumes, each available at archive.org nowadays: Vol I, Vol II. It is an illogical, outdated work based on faulty evidence, flawed reasoning, naive misunderstandings and wishful thinking. It seems clear Higgins considered Anacalypsis his main work, but he wrote an earlier work which it seems he considered a preparatory work, and he refers to it a fair bit in Anacalypsis as well. This work goes by the name The Celtic Druids. ... In the first pages of The Celtic Druids - duly note, not Anacalypsis, we find a staggering example of just how much of an ignorant man he was."
In his essay: "Godfrey Higgins' Anacalypsis: A Critique," JPH writes, "The work of Godfrey Higgins, Anacalypsis, is quite nearly as hard to find as a two-headed chicken -- and it is nearly as normal as one. ... It cites few sources for its claims, but those it does cite are the sort of things you won't find easily -- anyone wishing to back-check all of Higgins' comments will be in for a real lifetime chore .... There is no telling whether the bulk of Higgins' sources are credible or not (though we do have some hints). Anacalypsis is full of assertions that are either undocumented or come from sources whose credibility is completely unknown in this time .... It is also, furthermore, that Higgins is so outdated that any arguments he makes based on dating, language, and so on, require at this time a full re-argument before they can be accepted. ... Higgins' editor admits that Higgins was criticized by scholars who "felt that amateurs had no place in their special fields" [459], so even in his day he was obviously considered unreliable. How much more so today in light of what we know now? Anyone using Higgins as a source had best explain themselves as well as Higgins."
Higgins believed in a universal secret religious order. De Santillana had ideas about "the perpetual brotherhood of scientists." Just how far this extended, and extended back in time for de Santillana, is not established.
Beginning of Giorgio de Santillana's belief in astronomical mythology
In his book The Origin of Scientific Thought (1961) Giorgio de Santillana had set out his belief in an astronomical origin of myth and fairytale. In the Prologue to this book "Of High and Far-off Times" he traces back the roots of scientific thought to its origins in Neolithic Period astronomers. He also wrote of myths providing an astronomical code that had been previously overlooked by modern scholars. On page 11 he wrote: "The technical language of science can hardly be understood if it is not even recognized." The Prologue was also published in the quarterly magazine Midway, Volume XI, Number 1, Summer, 1970. It has been claimed by some the Hamlet's Mill is a sequel or elaboration of The Origin of Scientific Thought. However, this is a rather loose connection. The 1961 book merely sets out some ideas that de Santillana was pursuing about the origins of intelligence.
Source: Against Method by Paul Feyerband (3rd edition, 1993) Footnote 7, Pages 35-36.
In her book The Printing Press as an Agent of Change (Volume 1, 1980, Page 279, Note 349) Elizabeth Eisenstein writes: "de Santillana, book review [of Yate's work on Giordano Bruno], American Historical Review, ... contains hints of de Santillana's later collaborative book with Hertha von Dechend: Hamlet's Mill." In his review of Yate's work on Giordano Bruno, he pointed to certain problems presented by the "churning turbid flood" of Hermetic, Cabalistic and other esoteric literature. (See: American Historical Review, Volume LXX, January, 1965, Pages 455-457.) De Santillana, in Hamlet's Mill, credits von Dechend's 'discovery' of an astronomical explanation (the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn) to account for the high numbers of temple platforms on Necker and Tubuai as being persuasive for him in accepting an astronomical interpretation of cultural history.
Racism



One theme shared between the authors is the racist view that "astronomical culture" did not/could have never developed outside the Euro-Near Eastern sphere. It could have only developed once. This is evident in their published student notes for MIT. Hyperdiffusionism was the key. All other cultures are treated as pawns or configurations that are. to say the least, unbelievable and totally without foundation in either fact or reasonable theory.
Assessment of the authors of Hamlet's Mill
Von Dechend and de Santillana were not reasoning machines or purely cerebral academics. They were products of their time and cultures, with agendas.
Neither Giorgio de Santillana or Hertha von Dechend can be accurately described as polymaths. Hertha von Dechend especially falls below that description. Richard Flavin, who has a prodigious intellect and is somewhat sympathetic, also engages in a critique of certain ideas in Hamlet's Mill with his obituary of Hertha von Dechend. See further than the summary: "Epigraphic Society Occasional Papers, Table of Contents, Volume 24, 2004, In Memoriam: Dr. Hertha von Dechend (2 pp) Richard D. Flavin 24-p 296. A controversial scholar, Hertha von Dechend is most often remembered for her co-authorship with Giorgio de Santillana of Hamlet’s Mill: An essay on myth and the frame of time (Boston, Gambit Inc., 1969). Although she majored in archaeology and ethnology, Dechend concentrated most of her efforts in the study and teaching of science. Her major publications were few, but her intellect and influence were profound."
Some of von Dechend's ethnological ideas (embedded in Hamlet's Mill) are naive and uncritical, and characteristic of the period circa the turn of the 20th-century to the period of WWII.
The view of Professor Earl Milton
Extract of letter from Earl Milton (a professor, Department of Physics and Astronomy, at Lethbridge University, Alberta, Canada) to Alfred de Grazia, February 15, 1980 (http://archive.today/Aw8tC): "On a few occasions, the heretics would solicit funds from individuals in small amounts to disseminate a publication about Velikovsky, but efforts at larger funding failed. The Foundation for Studies of Modern Science initiated a series a approaches, of which I have already spoken; still, I shall add one more instance. Murray Rossant, Director of the Twentieth Century Fund, was reported by someone to be attracted to V.'s work. Because Deg and his brother, Sebastian, were already known and had been working with the Fund in very different fields, FOSMOS sent two fresh and handsome faces to meet with Rossant and his colleague Schwartz, Bruce Mainwaring and Coleman Morton, both enlightened businessmen. A friendly encounter ensued, the upshot of which was that, although the Fund had never gone into this area, the two officers were interested personally in seeking other sources of funding, and when all was said and done, nothing happened. Nothing, that is, except that the Fund itself gave money to Giorgio di Santillana and Hertha von Dechend for research that they were doing on ancient and primitive myth and legend which, it was believed beforehand, would show that mankind was clever and scientific long before it was credited with being so, but also that there was no need to invoke catastrophism to explain the nature of mankind's early preoccupations. This was recounted to Deg and the others by Stechini, who was well acquainted with Santillana and von Dechend. The product of the research, Hamlet's Mill, was welcomed by the heretics, nevertheless, for its intimations of ancient quantavolutions, but, if the reader wishes to understand the rampant confusion of the book, he may simply apply the hypothesis: here are two great scatomatized experts trying to avoid mention of catastrophism. Though they be liberal or conservative, foundations are unlikely to be creative. They think they are able to judge creativity, of course, and especially if large, "creativity" and the "independent sector" of society are often included in their slogans. Their size and their bureaucracy correlate well."
Sources of biographical information for Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha [Herta] von Dechend
For information on the authors see the sympathetic (English-language) obituary of Giorgio de Santillana (1902-1974) by Nathan Sivin (a former student of de Santillana at MIT), Professor of Chinese Culture and the History of Science, University of Pennsylvania, in Isis, Volume 67, 1976, Pages 439-493; and the (English-language) obituary of Hertha von Dechend (1915-2001) by Uta Lindgren, Professor of the History of Science, University of Bayreuth in Isis, Volume 94, 2003, Pages 112-113). Brief biographical information for both de Santillana and von Dechend appears in The World of Physics (1987) edited by Jefferson Weaver. For brief biographical details of de Santillana see the entry in, Directory of American Scholars: A Biographical Directory, Volume 1, published 1969 by the American Council of Learned Societies. For other obituaries of Giorgio de Santillana see: America, History and Life, Volume 15, 1979, Page 4 (Page 105 and Page 189 for obituaries). (Professor Uta Lindgren mistakenly credits Hertha von Dechend with being was the first person to analyse myths for their astronomical content. (Uta Lindgren was a good friend of Hertha von Dechend.) In his book, Mysteries and Discoveries of Archaeoastronomy (2009), Giulio Magli also mistakenly asserts that: "The first scholars to systematically investigate the idea that mythology contains a code for the transmission of ancient astronomical knowledge were Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha Von Dechend in their study Hamlet's Mill (1983) (sic)." (Perhaps the source for the mistaken views on priority was: Kelley, David. and Milone, Eugene (Gene). (2005; 2nd edition 2011). In, Exploring Ancient Skies: An Encyclopedic Survey of Archaeoastronomy the authors state that to their knowledge the only attempt to treat myths as astronomical systems on a world-wide basis is Hamlet's Mill (1969) by de Santillana and von Dechend. This demonstrates their lack of understanding of the basis for the book, which the contents and bibliography clearly show is the German star myth school and its derivative Panbabylonism.) This sort of analysis was a common 19th-century pastime for some writers such as George St Clair and Gerald Massey. A 20th-century precursor to Hamlet's Mill was contained in (the unpublished?) Mystery of the Zodiac (dated circa 1948) by (the somewhat obscure Polish writer) Witold Balcer.) Each obituary contains a photograph of the respective author. Both authors were experienced, though not major, historians of science. Giorgio de Santillana described himself as a scientific rationalist but, on the basis of Hamlet's Mill, he could also be described as an eccentric historian. It is undoubtedly correct to describe him as a polyhistor.

Biographical information for Giorgio de Santillana
De Santillana was an Italian born and trained historian of science (physicist and philosopher) who made his career at MIT. Giorgio de Santillana was born in Rome, Italy, and was of Jewish descent. His parents were David de Santillana and Emilia (Emily) de Santillana Maggiorani. Hamlet's Mill (1969) carries the dedication, "To the memory of my parents David de Santillana Emilia de Santillana Maggiorani." Il mulino di Amleto: Saggio sul mito e sulla struttura del tempo (1983) carries the dedication, "Alla memoria dei miei genitori David de Santillana Emilia de Santillana Maggiorani." (Several sources give 1901 as the year of Giorgio de Santillana's birth - not 1902. It appears, however, that 1902 is correct. (One early source even gives 1906 as year of birth.) He died in 1974 (aged 72 years).) One source states he was an Italian marquis but this is likely confusion with the Medieval Spanish writer, the Marques de Santillana (1398-1458). Exact life dates: Born May 30, 1902, Rome; died June 8,



1974, Beverly, USA. Note: At least one author mistakenly gives Giorgio de Santillana middle name as Giorgio Marquis de Santillana but correctly recognises that he was a scientist (physicist) and philosopher, trained in history.
In 1925 de Santillana gained his PhD from the Sapienza University of Rome. (The Sapienza University of Rome (Italian: Sapienza – Università di Roma), also called simply Sapienza or the "University of Rome," is a collegiate research university located in Rome, Italy. It was formally known as Università degli Studi di Roma "La Sapienza.")
Isaiah Berlin (Enlightening Letters 1946-1960 (2012) describes him as clever and interesting.
De Santillana had a cosmopolitan background. He had lived and taught in different countries (Italy, France, and the USA) and was fluent in English, French, and Italian. He spoke and wrote in these languages. In his academic work he was a person who challenged pedantic academic discourse.
Appointments held at MIT: Assistant Professor of the History of Science, 1942-1948; Associate Professor of the History and Philosophy of Science, 1948-1954; Professor of the History and Philosophy of Science, 1954-1967; Professor Emeritus in Humanities, 1967-1974. From 1943 to 1945 he was a correspondent for the US army. Note: In the early 1960's the profession of the history of science was beginning to develop especially among English-speaking scholars.
De Santillana was familiar with (could at least read) several ancient languages, including Greek and Latin. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He also attended AAAS meeting as a MIT representative. For 1961 at least, de Santillana was an officer (appointed to the Executive Board) of The Renaissance Society of America.
De Santillana was a boyhood friend of Lauro de Bosis (1901-1931), the gifted Italian poet and aviator. Harvard University offers a Lauro de Bosis Postdoctoral Fellowship. Alexandre Koyré (1892-1964), a French philosopher of Russian origin who wrote on the history and philosophy of science, was also a close friend of de Santillana.
He was both I. Bernard Cohen's mentor and his colleague. Frances Davis (Fearful Innocence, note 5, page 208) described de Santillana as one of Cohen's "political friends" to whom life was a state of exile. (I Bernard Cohen is his correct and full legal name.)
Giorgio de Santillana was quite socially active across continents. Susan Sontag recorded in her journal that Giorgio de Santillana was an invitee to a cocktail party held on 19 February 1959 by Jean Wahl at his Paris home. Jean Wahl (1888 in Marseille – 1974 in Paris) was a French poet and philosopher and Professor of Philosophy at the Sorbonne. The cocktail party was held after his late afternoon lecture on the conservative French (philosophical) poet and diplomat Paul Claudel (1868-1955), the younger brother of the sculptor Camille Claudel.
Giorgio de Santillana's had occasional asperity (harshness of tone or manner). He did not always suffer fools politely. At some stage at MIT, de Santillana had the habit of (late) night campus walks.
It is indicated that Hamlet's Mill was the outcome of his research focus for the previous 15 years. De Santillana was convinced that myth was the first scientific discourse.
A little known publication (some 200 pages) by Giorgio de Santillana is Lights and Shadows in the Philosophy of Science (1954); Issue 9 of Publications in the Humanities (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Humanities). Also, an early article is: "Greek Astronomy." by George de Santillana (Scientific American, Volume 180, Issue 4, 1949, Pages 44-47). At this time he was associate professor of history at MIT.

Excursus: Biographical information for David de Santillana
David de Santillana (commonly David Santillana) was an Islamist and authority on Moslem law, born in Tunis, North Africa, 1855; and died in Rome, 12 March 1931. He was a distinguished Orientalist and one of the foremost Islamists in Italy. (The origin of the de Santillana family is Spain - the name originating from the famous Spanish town Santillana del Mar.) For most of his career David de Santillana was Professor of the History of the Political and Religious Institutions of Islam, at the University Of Rome. See the short biographical entry: SANTILLANA, DAVID, in The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, Volume 9, 1943, Page 365. Some sources (mistakenly) state that David de Santillana was a Professor of Law (but he was a jurist). He was a specialist in Islamic law; and considered an expert in both Islamic and European law. He is generally described as a Orientalist. David de Santillana was a Tunisian Jew of Spanish descent. (Note: However, one source states "The jurist and Arabist David Santillana (1855-1931) was a "Portuguese" Jew of Ottoman Tunisia.") He was born in Tunis and studied in Rome where acquired a PhD in law. David de Santillana (born Tunis, 1855(sometimes mistakenly 1845) - died Rome, 1931) was a distinguished Orientalist (Arabist and expert of Islam) at the University of Rome; where he was Professor of Muslim history (Professor of the History of the Political and Religious Institutions of Islam). He also lectured on Arabic and Islamic topics in Arabic at Cairo University. He was described as having a "pleasant Tunisian accent." David de Santillana was naturalised British and then Italian. In 1899 he compiled a draft code of civil and commercial law for Tunisia which was partially enacted in 1906. (At the end of the 19th-century, the protectorate authorities established a commission for the codification of the laws of Tunisia and appointed Professor David Santillana, an expert in both Islamic and European civil law, to draft the document. He prepared (1889) the scheme of a code of civil law and commercial law to be adopted in Tunisia; it was praised as a work of exceptional judicial value and ingenuity, in view of the difficulty of conforming Islamic law in Tunisia to a heterogeneous Arab-European population.) His books/publications include: On Comparison between Islamic Law and European Laws: Civil and Commercial Laws, published in 1928, and his translation and comments on the book Mukhtasar Khalil (Khalil’s Treatise), published in 1919. Also, he wrote the chapter, "Law and Society," In: The Legacy of Islam, edited by Thomas Arnold and Alfred Guillaume (1931). A classic study is his, Istituzioni di diritto musulmano malichita, con riguardo anche al sistema sciafiita (2 volumes, 1925-38).
Note: The use of "de" and "von" in the names of Santillana and Dechend are Spanish and German nobiliary particles respectively. Their usage identities that they are originally aristocratic names denoting place of origin, usually an appanage (a royal grant of land) or fief, usually the result of a royal appointment, and are not surnames in the strict sense. A nobiliary particle is used in a family name or surname in many Western cultures to signal the nobility of a family. The particle used varies depending on the country, language and period of time.
Excursus: Biographical information for Emilia de Santillana



Emilia de Santillana (born Maggiorani) (Signora Emilia de Santillana Maggiorani) was active in social movements (women's rights movements). (Also perhaps one or more of the following: agricultural settlements, congregations of charity, orphanages, committees, charitable organizations for orphans of war.) Not a lot seems to be known about her. It is generally stated she flourished circa 1922. She was (at least in 1923) Secretary of the National Council of Women (using the name Emilia Santillana-Maggiorani). She was part of the movement of liberal, democratic, and radical women who before WWII were in the forefront of feminist agitation. This broad movement of women was not at all cooperative with the Fascist government, which actively sought to suppress the moment. In 1881 she received payment of a large amount of funds (but as yet I do not know further details). In 1923 the address for Emilia Santillana-Maggiorani is given as: Via Firenze 48, Rome. (It was once the home of an Aristocratic family; now the small Seiler Hotel. The location is in the (historical) centre of Rome.) See: Women of 1923, International, and Women and Social Movements, International - 1840 to Present. (An archive co-published by the Center for the Historical Study of Women and Gender at SUNY, Binghamton, and Alexander Street Press. Finalised 2012.)
Via Firenze 48, Rome. The residence of the de Santillana family (presumably an apartment within the building).

The Italian nationality de Santillana's were originally Spanish
David de Santillana (Giorgio's father) was a Tunisian Jew of Spanish descent. See the 1936 Passenger Manifest below where Giorgio de Santillana has, for 'Race,' crossed out 'Italian' and written 'Spanish.' Giorgio de Santillana is somehow related to the de Santillana's from Spain. Perhaps the Spanish ancestors of the de Santillana family were expelled from Spain circa the end of the 15th-century, or were exiles from the activities of the Inquisition. It appears that the inclusion of 'Diaz' (i.e., Giorgio Diaz de Santillana was not a leftover from the Spanish rule of Naples or Genoa.
Giorgio de Santillana's student studies
De Santillana was mostly educated in Rome.
De Santillana's student studies were conducted at the University of Rome. He received a Ph.D. (graduated) in physics from the University of Rome in 1925. (His doctoral dissertation was on The theorem of least action in relativist dynamics.) He then did 2 years of graduate work in philosophy (at the Sorbonne?) in Paris and then he also did 2 years of graduate work at the University of Milan (Physics Department) - he was assistant to Aldo Pontremoli in the University of Milan 1926-1927. As a student Giorgio de Santillana was one of a number of people involved in the project by Federigo Enriques (also a Roman of Jewish descent) to present classical period mathematical texts in forms accessible to both students and teachers in secondary schools.
Giorgio de Santillana's early academic career and publications
Circa 1930 (1927?) he was asked by Federigo Enriques, Professor of Higher Geometry at the University of Rome, to help organise a department for the History of Science. The Monthly Supplement, 1955, Page 1742, for the International Who's Who states: "Instructor, Rome University, 19291932." As an assistant of Federigo Enriques (in the Institute of the History of Science attached to the University of Rome) he taught the history and philosophy of science at Rome University. (He was an Instructor at the University for 2 years; working in the same university as his father.) He also collaborated with Federigo Enriques on a history of scientific thought that gave particular attention to antiquity. At this later date Federigo Enriques and Giorgio de Santillana worked together on a joint project to produce a comprehensive history of science. However they were only able to complete/publish a part in 1932 (Storia del pensiero scientifico) and then in 1937 (Platon et Aristotle). A publication (shortly after he arrived in the USA) included Mathématiques et astronomie de la période hellénique (1939, 78 pages) co-authored with Federigo Enriques. (Santillana's approach to history in some ways mimics Enriques.) In 1935 he gave a series of lectures at the Sorbonne, and he also conducted colloquia (seminars) in Brussels (Belgium) and Pontigny (France).
Giorgio de Santillana's immigration to the USA
Roman Jews were deported from the Italian capital to Nazi death camps during WW2.
There seems to be three versions of how he came to the USA. One version implies Giorgio de Santillana left Mussolini's Italy in 1938 when the race laws (discriminating against Jews) were introduced in November, 1938, and sought shelter in the USA (as a displaced foreign scholar). The race laws, amongst other things, excluded Jews from State controlled employment. (See: Italian Mathematics Between the Two World Wars by Angelo Guerraggio and Pietro Nastasi (2005, Page 141).) According to a second version Giorgio de Santillana left Mussolini's Italy in 1936 (some say 1935) (as discriminatory measures against Jews there were increasing) and came to the USA, assisted by a committee in the USA, as a displaced foreign scholar. (He was sponsored by The New School for Social Research.) Perhaps the dates mean he left Italy in 1935 and left Europe in 1936. (Either way, he sought shelter in the USA at that general time. I have also seen a third version which states he came to the USA from Paris in 1936 and soon after joined the faculty of MIT. This seems to be the correct version.) According to The Atlantic (Volume 176, 1945) Santillana's opposition to Mussolini drove him into exile. De Santillana was a fervent antifascist. The Monthly Supplement, 1955, Page 1742, for the International Who's Who states: "Came to the US in 1936." Although the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini initially distrusted the racism of Hitler’s National Socialism, he later accepted anti-Semitism. In 1938 Mussolini's government passed legislation which forbade marriage between Jews and non-Jews, and banned Jewish teachers from schools.
1936 passenger ship list recording Giorgio de Santillana.
Naturalization record for Giorgio de Santillana.
Jean Kelly in the United Kingdom has kindly brought my attention to information about Giorgio de Santillana she has uncovered on Ancestry (September, 2010). New York Passenger Lists, 1820-1957 records that in 1936 he departed from Cherbourg in France (by the passenger ship SS Aquitania, on 6th April) and on 14th April, 1936 he arrived at New York, New York State. Interestingly, for 'Race' he crossed out Italian and wrote 'Spanish.' This low resolution scan, though difficult to read, seems to state that Giorgio de Santillana was married. (A later high resolution scan confirms it.) It also gives his occupation as lecturer. The List also records that in 1946 a Giorgio Santillana departed Orly Airport, Paris and on 21st October, 1946 he arrived at New York, New York State. If this is Giorgio de Santillana then this would have involved one of his first post-war trips overseas. (A Giorgio di Santillana departed Rome, Italy in 1955 and arrived on 13th August, 1955 at Boston, Massachusetts. This is undoubtedly Giorgio de Santillana.) U.S. Naturalization Records Indexes Records, 1794-1995 records that on 26th March, 1945 he became a naturalised citizen of the USA. (Some record details are: Record number: 6551091; Name: Giorgio Diaz deSantillana; Residing at: 383 Harvard Street, Cambridge 38; Age: 42 years (May 30, 1902); Petition number: 282628; Alien registration number: 3178854. 383 Harvard Street is the address of Ware Hall. Ware Hall was built in 1893 and was added to the National Historic Register in 1983. It was primarily a residence comprised of apartments.) The Social Security Death Index records that in 1974 Giorgio Desantillana died in Essex, Massachusetts. (This is



undoubtedly Giorgio de Santillana.) (The Florida Death Index, 1877-1998 records that in 1974 Giorgio Diaz Desantillana died in Dade, Florida.) In November 2010 Jean Kelly kindly sent me a high resolution copy of a 1939 page from the U.S. Department of Labor, List or Manifest of Passengers for the United States of America, also uncovered on Ancestry. The information given on this page (unfortunately still sometimes difficult to read) includes: Sailed: Cherbourg, 26th August on the Empress of Australia [A 21,560-ton ocean liner that stayed in service until 1952. The partially completed hull was launched on 20 December 1913 and her first trip was 1 December 1919.]
The ship was built by Vulcan AG shipyard in Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland) for the Hamburg America Line as SS Tirpitz. She was taken as a war reparation in 1919 and sold to Canadian Pacific Steamships and was renamed firstly Empress of China in 1921 and then Empress of Australia in 1922]; Name: George de Santillana; Age 37 years; Married or single: M[arried]; Calling or occupation: Lecturer; Immigration Visa Number: N. Q. 71; Issued at: Paris; Date: 26th [?] August, 1939; Last permanent residence: Rome, Italy. This means he left Italy in 1935, left Europe in 1936 (for the USA), and he returned to Europe again only to leave again in 1939 (and return to the USA). By convention the date generally given by historians for the start of World War II is 1 September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland.
By the end of WWII Italy's Jewish communities had scattered widely. De Santillana was one of scores of Italian exiles who remained in their new country (Palestine, Britain, or USA).
According to Mark Stahlman, de Santillana was a member of the Italian Communist Party. This was not mentioned by de Santillana in any of his immigration or other official documents. However, de Santillana made it known to his friend Norbert Wiener, who was protective of the knowledge. There was the possibility of de Santillana becoming a target of political zealots during the Cold War hysteria. Post WWII was the 'Cold War' period. Wiener was concerned that de Santillana's past communist membership might be exposed and, at that at the very least he might be required to face the HUAC, and as a consequence be deported, or even jailed for falsifying his immigration papers. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) was created in 1938 to investigate alleged disloyalty and subversive activities on the part of private citizens, public employees, and those organizations suspected of having Communist ties.
Giorgio de Santillana's early academic career in the USA
From 1937 to 1938 de Santillana was an instructor at the New School for Social Research, in New York City. The Monthly Supplement, 1955, Page 1742, for the International Who's Who states: "Lecturer, New School for Social Research, 1936-1937." This was originally founded in New York City in 1919 as a private coeducational institution of higher learning for adults. (In 1997 its name was changed to New School University.) (He was actually connected with the University in Exile. This was founded in 1933 as a graduate division of the New School for Social Research as a haven for scholars who had been dismissed from teaching positions by totalitarian regimes in Europe. See: Intellectuals and Exile: Refuge Scholars and the New School for Social Research by Claus-Dieter Krohn (1993; Page 209). Between 1933 and 1945, Alvin Johnson and the New School sponsored 183 refugee scholars, more than any other American institution.) (His association with the New School of Social Research may help explain his attention to political and social issues extending at least through the end of the 1950s.) The New School has produced iconoclastic thinkers for the past century.
Source: (on left) The Tiger (Official Colorado College Student Newspaper) Friday, March 4, 1938, Page 2; (on right) The Tiger, Friday, March 11, 1938, Volume XXXX, Number 21, Frontpage. De Santillana was an excellent speaker/lecturer.
In 1938 he gave an illustrated lecture on French literature, in French (The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Sunday, November 27, 1938, Page 34). "Le sentiment tragique et la litterature en France, 1938."
De Santillana then became a visiting lecturer at Harvard University (suggested by one source as 1941). For some information about de Santillana at Harvard University (and the state of the history of science in the USA in the 1930's) see: "A Harvard Education." by I. Bernard Cohen (Isis, Volume 75, Number 1, March !984, Pages 13-21). De Santillana was at Harvard University in (at least) the 1930's. (According to The Monthly Supplement, 1955, Page 1742, for the International Who's Who he was a: "Visiting lecturer, Harvard University, 1937-1939.") The Report of the President of Harvard College and Reports of Departments, Volume 38, Issue 20, states: "Dr De Santillana - History of Leading Scientific Ideas from the Earliest Times to the Close of the Nineteenth Century." The Harvard Crimson, Friday, January 28, 1938, states: "Three graduates of foreign Universities are among the appointments to the faculty announced yesterday, to take office next September 1. George de Santillana a graduate of the University of Rome, now at the New School for Social Research in New York City, has been appointed lecturer on the History of Science for one year." The Official Register of Harvard University for 1939, 1940, and 1941 each list George de Santillana of the New School for Social Research, New York City. It is frequently stated he joined MIT in 1941 as Professor of English and History. (One source states he joined MIT in 1942 as Assistant Professor, in 1948 he was made Associate Professor (he was certainly Associate Professor of History at MIT in 1949), and in 1954 he was made Professor of the History of Science [Professor of the History and Philosophy of Science].) The Monthly Supplement, 1955, Page 1742, for the International Who's Who states: "Member, faculty, MIT, 1941." According to The Technology Review, Volume 44, 1942, Page 325, in 1942 de Santillana was promoted to the grade of Assistant Professor, Department of English and History. As late as circa 1950 he was referred to as George de Santillana. (In 1948 his office was 24-222, i.e., Building 24, Room 222. Building 24 was an 8-storey structure constructed in 1941. I do not know whether his office changed location. During the 1960s he had a secretary and also, hanging on one of the office walls, a large portrait of Galileo.) According to one source he became a naturalised citizen of the USA in 1945. However, I believe the date for this is correctly 1947. (According to the magazine Scientific American (1949) George de Santillana was (then) associate professor of history at MIT.)
Excursus: Interestingly, Henry Guerlac and Bernard Cohen. had come to know one another in the late 1930s through taking classes on the history of science in the Renaissance with the then Italian émigré scholar Giorgio de Santillana, then a visiting lecturer at Harvard. Henry Guerlac (19101985) was an American historian of science earned his PhD in European history from Harvard in 1941. He taught at Cornell University for 29 years where he was the Goldwin Smith Professor of History. (He introduced the history of science to Cornell Univesity.) Ierome Bernard Cohen (1914-2003) was an American historian of physical science. Cohen was the first American to receive a PhD in history of science, was a Harvard undergraduate (1937) and then a PhD student and protégé of George Sarton. He joined the Harvard faculty as an instructor in physics in 1942 and retired in 1984 as the Victor S. Thomas professor emeritus of the history of science.
Aronow remembers that de Santillana's office in the Humanities Building (Course XXI) was very small. He had several bookshelves but nothing unusual for an office that size. Books were generally strewn around as were papers. Aronow never saw de Santillana's library during his single visit to his home in Beverly.

Giorgio de Santillana's retirement from MIT



Giorgio de Santillana retired from MIT in 1967. His title became Professor Emeritus in Humanities. He was recognised as an outstanding
contributor to the academic reputation of MIT. (See: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Bulletin, Report of the President, 1967, Pages 12 & 220.) Immediately before his retirement he was focused on teaching Greek and Renaissance scientific thought.
A (3-hour) colloquium to honour Giorgio de Santillana on his retirement was held in the Hayden Library Lounge (in May, 1967) which comfortably seated 200 attendees. At the time of his death in 1974 Giorgio de Santillana was (apparently) Professor Emeritus, History and Philosophy of Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Excursus: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
MIT is a private research university located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1861, it adopted the European polytechnic university model. In 1916 the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) moved its campus from the Back Bay of Boston across the Charles River to Cambridge.

According to Jerome Lettvin (telephone conversation, 15/9/2006) up until the end of the 1960s at least, at MIT everything was sporadic [patchy] without tight management [by senior level of campus management]. Teaching staff self-organised a lot of activities as a way to get things done..
Giorgio de Santillana's efforts in establishing academic recognition for the history of science
At the time de Santillana secured his employment at MIT the recognition of the history of science as a scholarly discipline had not yet been established. (De Santillana was a second-generation historian of science as his father had been one of the most distinguished practitioners of that discipline at the turn of the 19th-century.) In the 1930s few universities in the USA had a graduate program in the history of science. Due to George Sarton's efforts at Harvard University the Ph.D. degree in the history of science was established. "Only recently has the history of science, thanks to the unflagging efforts of Dr. George Sarton and others, begun to achieve the recognition it deserves as a scholarly discipline in its own right." ("Science." by Francis Johnson and Sanford Larkey (Modern Language Quarterly, 1941, Volume 2, Number 3, Pages 363-401).) Both Willy Hartner and Giorgio de Santillana joined the Harvard group of history of science instructors in and shortly after 1935, and they both, in turn, formed new centres of work and instruction in the history of science. After World War II the principal persons who established the history of science as a recognised discipline within American universities are George Sarton, I. Bernard Cohen, Henry Guerlac, and Marshall Clagett.
Marshall Clagett was one of the first professional historians of science emerging from university studies in the USA after WWII.
Giorgio de Santillana's war time service
From 1943 to 1945 de Santillana was on the staff of the United States Army newspaper Stars and Stripes as a 'war correspondent.' One source states he returned to MIT in 1945. In 1945 de Santillana spent 8 months in Europe reporting on Italy. (It is unclear whether he was still in the US Army or with MIT at this time.) During the summer of 1946 he spent 4 months touring Italy and France. (See: "Europe Analyzed By De Santillana" in The Tech, Volume LXVI, Number 28, December 6, 1946, Pages 1 & 2.) In 1946 at least he was still with the English and History Department, MIT. I have no other knowledge/details of his war time service (The Monthly Supplement, 1955, Page 1742, for the International Who's Who). It was possibly because of his military service that his naturalisation as a USA citizen was facilitated.
The spelling George di Santillana
The spelling George di Santillana also appears. As example: For authorship of the articles "The Private and Public Life of Socrates." in The Commonweal, Volume 31, 1940; and "Galileo, the Ancient" in Science, Volume 96, 1942 (containing papers of Galileo symposium by the American Association for the Advancement of Science). (The spelling George di Santillana was used into the 1950s.) The American Association for the Advancement of Science Symposium in 1942 was in commemoration of the 300th anniversary of Galileo's death. In addition to Giorgio de Santillana, on "Galileo, the Ancient"; the participants were Henry Crew, on "Galileo, Pioneer in Physics"; and Chauncey Leake, on "Contributions of Science to the Concept of Freedom."
Excursus: Giorgio de Santillana's abiding interest in political and social issues
De Santillana retained an interest in political and social issues. De Santillana was described as a witty and acerb political analyst. As well as being a historian of science he was also a cultural historian.
Swarthmore Phoenix (Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, PA), Volume LVI, Number 24, April 27, 1937.
See: Norbert Wiener, Karl Deutsch, Giorgio de Santillana, "How U.S. Cities Can Prepare for Atomic War." (Life, 18 December, 1950, Pages 7686). Though the decentralized defence plan was originated, planned and calculated by the cybernetician Norbert Wiener; both Karl Deutsch and Giorgio de Santillana, members of M.I.T.'s history department, were ask to assist in its writing (and some fact-checking).
Carl Aldrich (https://carljaldrich.wordpress.com/tag/giorgio-de-santillana/): "Professors Norbert Wiener, a mathematician, Karl Deutsch, a political scientist, and Giorgio de Santillana, a historian, used the platform of LIFE magazine (Dec. 18, 1950) to outline their idea for "Life Belts" around major cities. These circular highways would be located approximately ten miles from the city center, with roads leading to them as spokes on a wheel. The three men designated the perimeter of the Life Belts as evacuation points for city dwellers. There would be tent cities, hospitals, rail services, food stocks, gasoline, and, of course, shopping malls. While awaiting the attack, the road could serve as a way to ease congestion in the metropolitan areas. Although they submitted the full manuscript of their "Civil Defense Plan" to academic journals, LIFE remains the only place that any part of it has been published. It seems to have stopped with that. Their creating a "Life Belt" plan was divergent from their normal projects, which they returned to without actively pursuing other avenues.
"The City as Communications Net: Norbert Wiener, the Atomic Bomb, and Urban Dispersal." by Robert Kargon and Arthur Molella (Technology and Culture, Volume 45, Number 4, October 2004, Pages. 764-777).: "In 1950, soon after finishing his cybernetics manifesto The Human Use of Human Beings, Wiener drafted an impromptu article on a subject ostensibly far removed from his primary interests in feedback control and information theory. It was a radical plan to redesign American cities in an attempt to solve problems of industrial concentration and urban congestion that he believed made them vulnerable to atomic attack. After completing the draft, he enlisted as collaborators two MIT colleagues and friends, the political scientist Karl W[olfgang]. Deutsch and the historian of science Giorgio de Santillana, who fleshed out Wiener's prose with some of their own. The trio also consulted with members of the MIT urban planning department and others concerned with civilian defense. The manuscript apparently never made it into print, despite the collaborators' efforts. Its only public trace was a December 1950 feature in Life



magazine, in which the three authors were interviewed about their "preparedness plan." Life's interest had been triggered by the unforeseen entrance of Communist China into the Korean War, which suddenly raised the prospect of nuclear Armageddon. The plan referred to in that interview does not appear in Wiener's bibliography as one of his publications, but we were able to track down the manuscript among his papers in the MIT archives. The undated document, almost certainly composed in the months leading up to the Life interview, appears in several drafts, the final version of which bears the title "Cities that Survive the Bomb." Although Deutsch and de Santillana are named as coauthors, Wiener was the principal writer and originator of the plan."
Giorgio de Santillana's historical perspective
De Santillana specialised in parallels between historical issues in science and present conflicts (for example, Oppenheimer / Galileo). (This comparison did not always meet with agreement and was viewed by some as forced.) He also specialised in Galileo. "Historian Giorgio de Santillana was directly inspired by the Oppenheimer case in writing The Crime of Galileo, published in 1958 (sic). In both cases, he argued, the free "scientific mind" was at odds with "Reasons of State." (Oppenheimer: The Tragic Intellect by Charles Thorpe (2006)
Giorgio de Santillana's early occult and pseudo-scientific leanings
His MIT courses showed flexibility. In the early 1950s Giorgio de Santillana, taught/conducted a one-year course on the inner meaning of Dante's Divine Comedy for Seyyed Hossein Nasr and his friends. De Santillana also introduced Nasr to the writings of René Guénon (sometimes spelled Guéron), who is considered by followers/disciples to be one of the 20th-century luminaries. De Santillana conducted an evening seminar at MIT that studied Hinduism through the works of René Guénon. (In Search of the Sacred by Seyyed Nasr with Ramin Jahanbegloo (2010, Page 42).) Guénon's writings have played a decisive role in laying the intellectual foundation of Nasr's traditionalist perspective. He was later decisively influenced by Frithjof Schuon, a leading exponent of the Advaita Vedanta school of philosophy.
Giorgio de Santillana wrote the Preface for Science and civilization in Islam by Seyyed Hossein Nasr (1968).
What is interesting is that de Santillana was Associate Professor of History at MIT in 1949, and in 1954 he was made Professor of the History of Science [Professor of the History and Philosophy of Science]. However, he seems to have made considerable effort to give attention to esoteric topics.
Seyyed Nasr was born (1933) into an Iranian family who were part of the Westernized Iranian elite. His father, Seyyed Valiallah, was a physician to the Iranian royal family, and also a political and intellectual figure. He was one of the founders of modern education in Iran (apparently the Iranian minister of education and dean of the Faculty of Humanities at Tehran University). At age 12(13?) years Seyyed Nasr was sent to a school in the USA. Though Seyyed Nasr completed his degree in science at MIT he felt that natural science was limited as a means of explanation of reality. (This early conviction was never to be reviewed. It seems to have been easily accepted without any further need for exploration. It might well have led to the conclusion that science is concerned with making factual statements. Also, the conclusion might have been reached that it is impossible to transcend the human reference point. Subjective preference/inclination seems indicated.) Seyyed Nasr turned his attention to philosophy and adopted intellectual principles of the Traditionalist School of metaphysics. During his MIT studies Nasr became acquainted with the works of the perennialist philosopher Frithjof Schuon and this school of thought has shaped Nasr's life and thinking ever since. Nasr has been a disciple of Frithjof Schuon for over 50 years and his works are based on the doctrine and the viewpoints of the perennial philosophy. Frithjof Schuon,(1907-1998) was a philosopher/metaphysicist/occultist inspired by the Hindu philosophy of Advaita Vedanta He was considered the foremost spokesman of the "Traditionalist" or "Perennialist" school and as a philosopher in the metaphysical current of Adi Shankara, also known as Shankaracharya (8th-century CE Hindu philosopher and theologian, leading exponent of the Advaita Vedanta school of philosophy), and Plato. Seyyed Nasr is essentially an Islamic philosopher and metaphysician/mystic/occultist. Seyyed Nasr is certain that there is such a thing as the Truth and that it can be attained through knowledge by means of the intellect that is guided and illuminated by divine revelation.
René Guénon (1886-1951), also known as Shaykh 'Abd al-Wahid Yahya, was a French neo-Gnostic author, Sufi, and intellectual who still remains an influential figure in metaphysic studies, having written on topics ranging from metaphysics, "sacred science," and traditional studies, to symbolism and initiation. Basically, René Guénon was an occultist who was opposed to the rational traditions of the western sciences. Likely, the interest for de Santillana was Guénon incorporated ideas and speculations about astronomical mythology. The precessional "Great Year" played a part in his esoteric/metaphysical system. See: Fundamental Symbols: The Universal Language of the Sacred by René Guénon (French language 1962; English translation 1995). Interestingly, René Guénon believed in the existence of ancient Thule (from an occult perspective), a Nordic equivalent of the vanished civilization of Atlantis. Guénon "wrote apocalyptic diatribes against rationalism and western ideas of progress." In his book, The Crisis of the Modern World (1978), he "identified a sacred tradition as the controlling force in the universe" and "argued that the sterility and degradation in the modern world was the direct result of the substitution of economic growth for metaphysics and the abandonment of the rigid tradition of medieval Christianity." (See: The Devil and James McAuley (1999, Pages 92-93) by Cassandra Pybus.) See also the critique of René Guénon in Essai su le mystère de l'histoire by Jean Daniélou (1953, Pages 120-126). Robin Waterfield notes that Guénon followers/disciples tend to see The Crisis of the Modern World "as an infallible textbook giving the correct attitude to be adopted when confronted with a problem or situation." The Primordial Tradition concept supported by René Guénon is a school of religious philosophy that holds its origins in the philosophia perennis (perennial philosophy), which is in turn a development of the prisca theologia of the Middle Ages. The Primordial Tradition seeks to establish a fundamental substrata of religious belief in all authentic religious teachings, adhering to the principle that universal truths are a cross cultural phenomenon and transcendent of their respective Traditions, mythologies, and religious beliefs. The process utilized is similar to the study of the history of religions and comparative mythology as is found in the works of authors such as Mircea Eliade. It can also be found in the school of archetypal psychology and in the ideas of Carl Jung. The metaphysical/esoteric philosopher Frithjof Schuon (1907-1998) wrote: "More than once, one has the impression that Guénon reads into documents what he wishes to find in them." See also: Against the Modern World by Mark Sedgwick (2004). A biography of René Guénon.
Mircea Eliade (1907-1986) Romanian historian of religion, and professor at the University of Chicago. Eliade argued that the Panbabylonian school was correct in comparing religious phenomena which were "historically related and structurally analogous." Eliade drew on a number of Panbabylonian ideas. "Wheatley's arguments concerning the axis mundi was based on the work of Eliade. Eliade in turn based his arguments on the Pan-Babylonian scholars - with the crucial difference that the Pan-Babylonian scholars saw notions of the sacred center as diffused from the Near East, whereas Eliade saw them as a universal aspect of what he called primitive cultures. In other words the entire notion of an axis mundi came originally from the Pan-Babylonian scholars' reading of Near Eastern materials, and Eliade, and later Wheatley, then universalized the notion. However, the existence of the notion of an axis mundi in the Near Eastern materials has been called into question as well. As Jonathan Z. Smith (To Take Place, p. 16) has argued: "There is no pattern of the 'Center' in the sense that the Pan-Babylonians and Eliade described it in the Near Eastern materials." (To Become a God: Cosmology, Sacrifice, and Self-Divinization in Early China by Michael Pratt (2002, Page 42, Note
37.) Mircea Eliade has been described as "notoriously reluctant" to elaborate on the origins of mythological motifs. However, what few statements he did make on the issue demonstrate his close affinity with the ideas of the nature-school of the early 19th-century (i.e., Max Müller). (For



example see Eliade's: Patterns in Comparative Religion (1958, Pages 449 onwards.) The Romanian émigré-scholar to the USA, Mircea Eliade recognized he was not "systematic" in his explanations and that he failed to express his views in a logical and rigorous manner.
Seyyed Hossein Nasr (The Philosophy of Seyyed Hossein Nasr (2001, Page 17 & 18) makes several interesting comments about Giorgio de Santillana: "He had been a collaborator with Émile Meyerson in the effort to combat logical positivism. ... He was also seriously interested in Hinduism and Islamic thought, his father David de Santillana having been one of the foremost Islamicists of Italy. ... [H]e was deeply interested in traditional metaphysics and metaphysical philosophy and regretted their eclipse in the modern West." Science and Civilization in Islam by Seyyed Hussein Nasr (1968) contained a Preface by Giorgio de Santillana. For the book's inaccuracies and mystical interpretation see the (Englishlanguage) book review by A. G. Molland in The British Journal for the History of Science, Volume 4, Number 4, December, 1969, Page 416.
"De Santillana himself had been a friend and collaborator of Émile Meyerson [(1859-1933), Polish-born French epistemologist, chemist, and philosopher of science] and opposed [Henri] Poincaré in the famous debates that were carried on in the early part of the 20th century in France." (In Search of the Sacred by Seyyed Nasr with Ramin Jahanbegloo (2010, Page 40).) Poincaré's writings about the foundations of mathematics inevitably led to discussions/debates about the nature of knowledge and certainty. The French mathematician Henri Poincaré (1854-1912) is regarded as perhaps the greatest celestial mechanic of all time. The study of celestial behaviour in celestial mechanics dates back to the pioneering work of Henri Poincaré on the so-called three-body problem. It resulted in the introduction of the revolutionary concept of chaos into celestial mechanics.
There is reason to believe that at least some of his ideas concerning the early history of science bordered on the mystical. In a 1994 (1997?) interview Jerome Lettvin related that de Santillana would conduct Tarot readings (and seemed to earnestly believe in the veracity of such). According to Lettvin, de Santillana conducted a Tarot reading for his wife Maggie and multiple Tarot readings for Walter Pitts, who constantly requested such. In his autobiography in The History of Neuroscience in Autobiography, Volume 2 (1998, Pages 222-243), edited by Larry Squire, Lettvin writes (Page 234): "One of my best friends at MIT was Giorgio de Santillana, the historian of ideas. He was a most learned and kindly man with a mordant wit. Walter, Wiener, and I often hung out at his office. (Both Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend were acknowledged influences on Jerome (Jerry) Lettvin.) Giorgio was a past-master at fortune-telling with the Tarot. Wiener loved having his fortune told. Giorgio vainly tried to persuade him that the Tarot should be a rare and sometime thing to be used only in crisis, but Wiener would have none of such excuses. For example, Walter and I used it when we started a new experimental venture." Needless to say this is all quite bizarre. (One supporter of Hamlet's Mill attempts to dismiss this as merely the 'lighter side' of de Santillana. Nothing supports this view.) (At least one academic offered that in 1944 Giorgio de Santillana gave a talk in which he appears to have indicated his belief in a "quasi-mystical unanalyzable sort of event." (See: The Foundational Debate: Complexity and Constructivity in Mathematics and Physics edited by Werner DePauli-Schimanovich et al.
(Series: Vienna Circle Institute Yearbook, Volume 3; 1995, Page 271).) Giorgio de Santillana had Merlin fantasies. It appears de Santillana held the fantasy that he was the reincarnation of Merlin travelling backwards in time.) He would sometimes sign his letters (and books) "Giorgio (Merlin)" or simply "Merlin." This is very bizarre.
Hertha von Dechend and the tarot
"An investigation of the original scientific meaning of tarot cards has been started without mutual knowledge by Phyllis Ackerman in the United States and by Hertha von Dechend in Germany." ("The Origin of the Alphabet." by Livio Stecchini (The American Behavioural Scientist, February 1, 1961, Volume 4, Issue 6, Pages 3-7, Page 5).) 'Tarot' does not appear in the index to Hamlet's Mill. Obviously the intention of von Dechend was to link an ancient tarot with cosmology.
The original purpose of tarot cards was to play games, a very cursory explanation of rules for a tarot-like deck is given in a manuscript by Martiano da Tortona before 1425. When not used for card games tarot cards are used primarily for divinatory purposes. Livio Stecchini believed that tarot cards originated in Mesopotamia. Playing cards first entered Europe in the late 14th-century, most likely from Mamluk Egypt. The first documented tarot packs were recorded between 1440 and 1450 in Milan, Ferrara, Florence and Bologna. For a completely speculate alternative history see perhaps: Origins of the Tarot Deck: Study of the Astronomical Substructure of Game and Divining Boards by Stephen Franklin (1988). Franklin is basically an occultist and supporter of Hamlet’s Mill.
Phil Norfleet, an uncritical supporter of Hamlet's Mill and its authors, uncritically (and without explanation) describes de Santillana as "an expert on Tarot card reading." Norfleet offers no evidence to support what is somebody else's opinion. This statement concerning tarot use simply identified that de Santillana was credulous/superstitious. The tarot deck is used for divination. The earliest known tarot decks were not designed with divination in mind; they were actually meant for playing a parlor game (a game called triumph) similar to modern-day bridge. There is no documented evidence of the tarot being developed for divination purposes or of the usage of tarot for divination before the 18th-century. Also, tarot cards are not ancient. According to Tarot historian Tom Tadfor Little, traditional playing cards were first seen in Europe in 1375, having been brought over from the Islamic societies where they had been used for centuries before that. These cards were not, however, Tarot cards. At this point, he says, there is no evidence to show that Tarot cards had yet been created, which goes against many claims that ordinary playing cards evolved from the original Tarot deck. It wasn't until 1440 that the cards that were most likely the origin of Tarot cards were first mentioned.
Giorgio de Santillana's academic interest in art
Giorgio de Santillana had an academic interest in art. (See: De Santillana, Giorgio. "The Role of Art in the Scientific Renaissance." In: Critical Problems in the History of Science edited by Marshall Clagett, (1959) pages 33-65; Reprinted in: The Rise of Modern Science edited by G. Basalla (1968) pages 76-82.) At least for 1961-1962 de Santillana was a member of the Renaissance Society of America.
Giorgio de Santillana and Galileo
Henry Guerlac states that for de Santillana "Galileo is the central symbolic figure linking the Ancients with the Moderns." (Galileo's lifework in mechanics was a sort of watershed between medieval and modern science. A large part of Galileo's work challenged previously held Aristotelian assumptions. Among the most prominent were his studies of projectile motion and inertia. Galileo destroyed the fabric of Aristotelian science on which medieval thought had rested. Due to the influence of Aristotelian philosophy on religion at the time it can be seen that these new views were an indirect challenge to religious authority.) George Basalla (The Rise of Modern Science (1968)) wrote: "Few who write on Renaissance science today can match de Santillana's knowledge of the philosophical currents of that era." For errors in De Santillana's scholarship on Galileo see: Galileo, Science, and the Church by Jerome Langford (1992). Also see: Galileo and the Church: Political Inquisition or Critical Dialogue by Rivka Feldhay (1995).
For a quite different account of the origin of Galileo's troubles with Rome see, Galileo, Heretic by Pietro Redondi (1987). (See also: The Advancement of Science by Philip Kitcher (1995).



Mary Lefkowitz and Guy Rogers (Black Athena Revisited, 1996, Page 223), discussing Martin Bernal's claims for de Santillana, state: " ... de Santillana was at best a minor figure, hardly "one of the greatest, if not the greatest, historians of Renaissance science" (BA I:275). His provocative, sympathetic and pro-Galileo, and passionately anticlerical book on Galileo's trial, The Crime of Galileo (1955), does not stand up very well in the light of recent research on Galileo's trial and its background, and his revision of a seventeenth-century English version of Galileo's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1953) was already superseded when it appeared by the publication of Stillman Drake's superior translation in the same year." (Worth referring to is: "New Galilean Studies." by Giorgio de Santillana (Isis, Volume 33, Number 6, June, 1942, Pages 654-656.) De Santillana's edition of Galileo's Dialogue on the Great World Systems [Concerning the Two Chief World Systems] was the first modern English translation in 300 years, based on the early translation of Thomas Salusbury (published in 1661). In 1664 Salusbury also published a life of Galileo. Critics did praise de Santillana's efforts (see the favourable English-language book reviews by Douglas McKie in The New Scientist, 3rd October, 1957, Page 35; and the book review in Scientific American, Volume 189, 1953, Page 104), which had involved de Santillana in painstaking research and also a painstaking revision of the Thomas Salusbury version. It had a 40-page historical introduction and inclusion of numerous notes. However, it is criticised for remaining muddled and inaccurate in places. It was during the course of these efforts that de Santillana had the idea of writing The Crime of Galileo (a revisionist view of events concerning Galileo's conflict with the Catholic Church.). Critics of this book pointed out errors and erroneous claims, especially in de Santillana's discussion of "Ad Lectorem." (See: The Copernican Achievement by Robert Westman (1975, page 240).) For a scathing review of The Crime of Galileo see the book review by Henry Callahan, The Catholic Historical Review, Volume 42, Number 1, April 1956, Pages 66-67. He wrote: "The combination of error and camouflage on the one hand, and the lack of documentation on the other, make the book highly unusable for historians."
At least Professor Robert Palter (when at the University of Texas at Austin) held that de Santillana's reputation as a translator of Galilean material is low present-day. (See: Black Athena Writes Back (2001) edited by David Moore.) (Robert Palter was at least 1995-2006, Dana Professor of the History of Science (Emeritus), Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut.) De Santillana's reputation certainly reached a low ebb with the publication of Hamlet's Mill.
The Crime of Galileo has been published in French, Italian, Swedish, and German languages.
De Santillana's dispute with Arthur Koestler over Galileo
Giorgio de Santillana had an ongoing dispute/disagreement with Arthur Koestler regarding Galileo. It concerned their contrasting views of the Galileo trial. De Santillana's pro-Galileo, antichurchmen stance in The Crime of Galileo (1955) was opposed by Arthur Koestler in The Sleepwalkers (1959). (See: Galileo, Science, and the Church by Jerome Langford (3rd-edition, 1992, Page 197).) Likely also over Koestler's overly-critical approach to some of Galileo's ideas, in his book The Sleepwalkers (1959). See: the book review article: "Arthur Koestler and His Sleepwalkers." by Giorgio de Santillana and Stillman Drake (Isis, Volume 50, Number 3, September, 1959, Pages 255-260). It sets out the view that Koestler is unfair to Galileo. See also "Reply" i.e., "Replies to a review of The Sleepwalkers by Giorgio De Santillana and Stillman Drake." (Isis, Volume 51, March, 1960, Pages 73-76).
In his book de Santillana supported the view that Galileo was unfairly persecuted (and this was taken as evidence of anticlerical prejudice). For de Santillana, Galileo was a hero of science who was brought down by Roman Catholic senior churchmen. For a discussion that de Santillana's 1955 book on Galileo is a biased work see: Galileo's Mistake by Wade Rowland (2003, Page 11).
Excerpt from: Intelligent Inference and the Web of Belief by Ronald Pine (1996, PhD Thesis, Chapter 2: The Copernicus Episode.) "The initial
review of Koestler's book by Santillana and Drake(5) [Santillana, George and Drake, Stillman, (1959), Isis, Vol. 50.] was equally extreme, prompting further shrill responses in defense of Koestler. According to Santillana and Drake, Koestler depicts the founding fathers of the Copernican revolution as "antisocial schemers, cowards, liars, hypocrites, irresponsible cranks or contemptuous snobs." In portraying the revolution this way, they claim Koestler has the "unique inability to understand what Galileo wrote" and "the distinction of being the first writer to misunderstand (Galileo's sunspot argument) entirely," that Koestler's book is full of "insolent misrepresentations" and his "ulterior motive" is the "blackening of science as the destroyer of 'spiritual values'," and finally that his thesis is "repugnant to everything we have written, and in
contradiction with all that we have learned in the course of years devoted to these studies."(6) [Santillana, George and Drake, Stillman, (1959), Isis, Vol. 50.] According to Santillana and Drake, one of the many things we have learned is that "Galileo seems to have been practically the only man
of his age who was fully aware of what was happening and what would follow."(7) [Santillana, George and Drake, Stillman, (1959), Isis, Vol. 50, Page 255, Note. 2. An extreme characterization when one considers Galileo's adherence to circular motion and his flipflop on comets.] For a response to this review, consider Mark Graubard's summation after noting that Santillana's and Drake's attack of Koestler was "hostile to a degree rarely encountered in academic literature: . . . history shows reason and scientific rightness to have been with Bellarmine and not with Galileo, who truly had no evidence besides the phases of Venus which disproved Ptolemy, but not Brahe. There was indeed no real proof. . . . The overall work of traditional historians such as Santillana, compares to the contribution of Koestler much as the work of rat-psychologists compares to the contribution of a Sophocles, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy or Faulkner to our knowledge of the human psyche, even though here and there Santillana does
point to a slight inaccuracy of no genuine relevance."(8) [Graubard, Mark, (1976), "The Sleepwalkers: Its Contribution and Impact." In: Astride the Two Cultures: Arthur Koestler at 70, Harold Harris, (Editor), Pages 21-36; see Pages 31-32.]."
De Santillana's dispute with Otto Neugebauer over Pythagoreanism

This is something of a contrast to Hamlet's Mill. In Hamlet's Mill the authors argue for the pre-Greek origin of mathematics and astronomy.
Giorgio de Santillana's frequent overseas trips
Beginning early in the post WWII period de Santillana made a number of overseas trips to Europe. De Santillana was The Atlantic (journal) correspondent in Italy in the years immediately following the end of World War II. In 1946 at least (and probably as early as 1943) he was a foreign correspondent in Italy and Yugoslavia for The Atlantic. He made annual visits abroad during the summer.
He was a Fulbright Fellow in Italy, 1954-1955.
De Santillana also visited England several times (at least 1957 and 1961). The Oxford Magazine, Volume 76, 1957, reported that Giorgio de Santillana was visiting Oxford on Friday, 30th May (to lecture on "The Issues in Galileo's Trial"). It appears that de Santillana's trip to Europe in 1961 (encompassing at least Oxford, England and Naples, Italy) was at least partly in the company of Jerome Lettvin and his family. (Jerome Lettvin and family visited Naples in 1961.) De Santillana's trip to Italy may have encompassed meeting his son Ludovico and his wife Anna, and



grandchildren Laura and Allessandro. (Laura is Italian, she was born in Venice (Italy) in 1955 (some sources incorrectly state 1950) and studied at the School of the Visual Arts in New York. She lives and works in Venice, Italy. Allessandro was born in 1959 in Paris (France) and was educated at The University of Venice, Venice, Italy.)
The committee of the Associazione Culturale Italiana invited de Santillana to give a lecture in Turin in March, 1963, entitled "Fato antico e fato moderno" ("Ancient and Modern Ideas of Fate"). One of the major points of the lecture was the idea that "the great cosmological myths both preceded and had been the equivalent of modern science."
The Experimental Epistemology Laboratory
At MIT Giorgio de Santillana, Hertha von Dechend, Harald Reiche, Jerome Lettvin, Warren McCulloch, and Walter Pitts were all part of a group which called itself the Experimental Epistemology Laboratory. (Norbert Wiener may have been also part of the group. Wiener associated closely with de Santillana.) This was Jerome Lettvin's laboratory and office and was a gathering point for group meetings. MIT materials science professor Robert Rose recalls Lettvin was perhaps at his best holding forth at the giant table (holding a telephone in his Building 20 office, where colleagues loved "schmoozing and arguing and calling each other names." (See: MIT News Magazine, January/February, 2013.) (Jerome Lettvin's office and multiple laboratories occupied Wing C of Building 20.) For many years, Jerome Lettvin's laboratory located in the easternmost wing of ramshackle Building 20 at MIT had a sign reading "Experimental Epistemology Laboratory" on the door. (According to another version the sign actually read "J. Y. Lettvin Experimental Epistemology.")
The room was almost always left untidy with paperwork,.and a telephone was a dominant feature on the table and frequently used. The door to the room was almost always left open.
The name "experimental epistemology" likely owes to Warren McCulloch. According to one informed source "Experimental Epistemology" was a phrase coined by Jerry Lettvin and Oliver Selfridge. The phrase was a sign on the door of McCulloch's new state-of-the-art brain research laboratory. From 1952 (when he joined MIT) until his death in 1968/1969? Warren McCulloch (1898-1968/1969?) was a professor at MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics. McCulloch was a physician (who trained in neurology, 1928-1931) turned physiologist. McCulloch characterised his work as 'experimental epistemology,' the study of the nature of knowledge through understanding the nature of the brain within which it resides. 'Experimental epistemology' is a pun on the EE of 'electrical engineering.' Warren McCulloch worked with, and influenced, Jerry Lettvin at MIT. (McCulloch was Lettvin's mentor. Both were irreverent. McCulloch and Lettvin initially met in 1941 when Lettvin was McCulloch's student.) Working with Walter Pitts, McCulloch constructed a logical model of the nature of mental activity. (However, without Pitts' continued input McCulloch's logical models encountered significant problems.) (See: Systems Thinking by Magnus Ramage and Karen Shipp (2009, Page 28).)
In the 1950s and 1960s "the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT was a playground of new thought. Engineers, mathematicians, and scientists mingled with linguists and poets, artists and musicians, [etc] ...." (Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science edited by Lynn Nadel (Volume 1, 2003, Page 1042.)
For decades Lettvin was located in (or kept control of) a small decrepit wooden shack on the roof of the EE building (the tall old physics building). The meetings of the Experimental Epistemology Laboratory took place in this location because Lettvin enjoyed smoking and the shack was the room at MIT that was not subject to a smoking ban (MIT allowed him to smoke there after bans were introduced). At one time Lettvin was smoking 3 packets of cigarettes per day. Access was via an elevator and then a final climb up a rickety staircase to the roof. The door lock was then opened with a credit card or similar 'tool.' The meetings of the Experimental Epistemology Laboratory were held on Friday afternoons. The regular attendance of 'members' (MIT academic staff and students) was occasionally bolstered (apart from birds and bats) by the presence of a visitor (often a noted academic visiting MIT). In 1960 the British academic Aldous Huxley (1894-1963) arrived at MIT as Carnegie visiting professor of humanities. He became an occasional visitor to Experimental Epistemology Laboratory. (Aldous Huxley came to live in the USA in 1936.) At one time Aldous Huxley even attempted to clean up the room.
Tim Wilson, writing in 2005 about his student experiences at MIT in the early 1970s, recollects that he "got to hang out at Lettvin's lab, which was a kind of nearly-never-ending bull session on everything." Also, Abe Aronow frequently 'hung out' at the Experimental Epistemology Laboratory. He recalls: "The place was marvelously (sic) stimulating, although the "Bull" was often boot high." Lettvin published very little. Most of his work was conveyed through lectures and conversations.
Norbert Wiener, Warren McCulloch, Walter Pitts, and Giorgio de Santillana discussed the construction of a practical philosophy of technology for the modern age. (Jerome Lettvin and others would also meet in Giorgio de Santillana's office.) (During 1965-1966 Douglass Carmichael - then a student - spent a lot of time with Jerry Lettvin.) In 1951 Giorgio de Santillana and Walter Pitts collaborated in a rebuttal of Erich Frank's attempt in the 1920s to reject all the fragments attributed to the 5th-century Greek philosopher Philolaus as spurious. (See: "Philolaos in Limbo, or: What Happened to the Pythagoreans?" by George de Santillana and Walter Pitts (Isis, Volume 42, Part 2, 1951, Pages 112-120).) Walter Pitts and Hertha von Dechend were also very close friends, had lots of lengthy conversations, and Walter Pitts had a small influence on Hamlet's Mill. Walter Pitts was a participating audience member for the 1961 seminar. He also prepared a critical summary of Norman Lockyer's work, The Dawn of Astronomy, which Hertha von Dechend presented as the 1961 seminar continued. (During the early 1960s Giorgio de Santillana and Walter Pitts collaborated on a book on Parmenides. It later appeared as an essay only. Walter Pitts believed that he had a metaphysical experience when he was young that enabled him to see that logic rules the universe.)
Abe Aronow believes (personal communication): "There was an undoubted intellectual cabal at MIT at that time [the 1960s] that provided cross pollination and lots of stimulus to the students." The intellectual cabal was likely based around the group of MIT academics which called itself the Experimental Epistemology Laboratory. (The definition in Wikipedia is likely best describes the issue: "A cabal is a group of people united in some close design together, usually to promote their private views or interests in a church, state, or other community, often by intrigue.") The core 'members' of the Experimental Epistemology Laboratory were a small cabal in their support and promotion of the ideas of de Santillana and von Dechend.

Excursus: Building 20
Building 20 at 18 Vassar Street was built by MIT in 1943 (during WWII) and demolished in 1996. It is commonly stated it took less than 1 day to design. It was intended to demolish the building at the end of WWII. It was built as a temporary structure to house part of the Radiation Laboratory. With the end of WWII and the disbandment of the Radiation Laboratory the building was consigned to (returned to the control of)



MIT. The all-wooden structure was termed "Plywood Palace." After some dormancy the building became the first residence for the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE). RLE was founded in 1946. Jerry Lettvin gained a full-time entry-level position at MIT at the RLE. As the building was made to support heavy loads even the roof was used to house equipment and instruments.
Short biographical note for Jerome Lettvin
Jerome Lettvin was a maverick professor of electrical engineering. Jerome Lettvin (Chicago, 23.2.1920 - Hingham, MA, 23.4.2011), a charismatic figure, was a cognitive researcher at MIT and eventually Professor Emeritus of Electrical and Bioengineering and Communications Physiology. Lettvin joined MIT in 1951. In Encounter, Volumes 64-65, 1985, Page 18, Dr Jerome Lettvin is described as "Professor of Communications, Physiology, and Bio-engineering in the Departments of Computer Science, Biology, and Electrical Engineering at MIT."
Lettvin trained as a neurologist and M.D. at the University of Illinois receiving a B.S. and an M.D. (in 1943) and, was an intern at Boston City Hospital. The U.S. Army provided him with further training as a psychiatrist, and he was an Army doctor during the Battle of the Bulge. After WWII he spent 1 year as a neurologist at the University of Rochester, then a further 31⁄2 years as a psychiatrist at Manteno State Hospital in Illinois.
In the Fall of 1946 Lettvin came to MIT as a specialist student. Jerome Lettvin, Walter Pitts, and Oliver Selfridge shared a flat at 139 Beacon Street in Boston. In her 2012 article Tara Abraham states very quickly they befriended de Santillana. Lettvin and Oliver Selfridge (1926-2008) are described as being engaged in endless scientific and money-making schemes. Selfidge was attached to the Lincoln Laboratory, MIT, for his entire career. For a time both Jerome Lettvin and Walter Pitts lived in Walter McCulloch's house. Lettvin remained a lifelong friend of Walter Pitts. It is indicated that not everybody was happy with the influence of Lettvin on Pitts.
Lettvin gave generously of his time even when busy with work demands. Lettvin's great idol was the Spanish pathologist, histologist and neuroscientist Ramon y Cajal (1852-1934, a Nobel laureate), a volume of whose work was always kept nearby. Jerry Lettvin smoked 3 packets of cigarettes per day and for a large duration of his adult life he weighed approximately 137 kilograms (300 pounds). He lived to be 88 years old.
On retirement, Jerry Lettvin’s title became Professor of Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering, Emeritus, at MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
See the Obituary for Jerome Lettvin in The Boston Globe, May 15, 2011; and the Obituary notice by Alex Andrew in Kybernetes, Volume 40, Issues 7/8. See also the Wikipedia entry: Jerome Lettvin (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Lettvin). At the 'memorial' website for Jerome Lettvin he is mentioned as being an influence on de Santillana and von Dechend. This is likely connected with his studies of cognition.
Lettvin wanted von Dechend to remain in the USA (telephone conversation, 15/9/2006). I would presume that he would have attempted to find a permanent position for her at MIT.
Jerome Lettvin and Hamlet's Mill
Jerry Lettvin, a supporter of Hamlet's Mill, suggested that the myth of Perseus not only encodes knowledge about the Mediterranean fauna and especially various species of squid. Lettvin also makes a case for the Gorgons and Phorcyades in the myth of Perseus corresponding to squid, sepia, and octopus. Also, knowledge about the constellations that bear the name of the protagonists with special focus on Algol (the only star whose brightness changes visibly in the course of a single night), and so was identified with the evil eye of Medusa (which can bring death), Lilith and other malevolent demons or deities. Algol is a binary (double and therefore “blinking”) star. He also connected the diamond sword of Perseus to the meteor showers which regularly spring from the wrist of the figure in the constellation. (See: "The Gorgon’s Eye." by Jerome Lettvin, In: Astronomy of the Ancients edited by Kenneth Brecher and Michael Feirta (1979, Pages 133-151). Lettvin ends his article by commenting that myth: "... is dangerous, too, because you are sure to go too far when you attempt to reinterpret myth. I myself have gone much too far in this article, and so can be accused of making my own myth to render memorable the sundry places in the sky. I am not offended by that charge at all. If you find the story of the octopus, Algol, and the Gorgon Medusa irritating enough to recall, I will have explained the ancient arts of memory more by illustration than by proof. Most of you, of course, may prefer a rational account of things; but I was never one to put Descartes before Horus."
Jerome Lettvin's contribution "The Gorgon's Eye" suggests that the myth of Perseus not only encodes knowledge about the Mediterranean fauna and especially various species of squid but also encodes information about the constellations bearing the name of the protagonists with special focus on the star Algol, the only star whose brightness changes visibly during the course of a single night, and which was in consequence identified with the evil eye of Medusa, Lilith and other malevolent demons or deities. Lettvin also emphasises the role of mythic tales for memorising information (see pages 133-135 of his essay in, Astronomy of the Ancients).
One of Jerry Lettvin's few essays supporting the theme of Hamlet's Mill. The essay contains several substantial errors, such as an archaic zodiac. Interestingly, at the end of the essay Lettvin gives details of his earliest jobs. Source: MIT - The Technology Review, Volume 78, Number 7, June 1976, Pages 53-57.
Walter Pitts
Jerry Lettvin described Pitts as self-taught mathematical genius. Pitts had a prodigious talent for mathematics and formal logic. By 1946 he was widely considered to be a polymath. Pitts was a neuroscience pioneer. Personality-wise Pitts had always been gentle, shy, and introverted. He was considered eccentric.
Pitts had a troubled childhood and ran away from home he still quite young. Walter Harry Pitts, Junior, was born in Detroit on 23 April 1923, the son of Walter and Marie (née Welsia). His father and brothers were rough, uneducated persons who regarded him as a freak. At age 15 he ran away, and from that time he refused to speak of his family. For the duration of his life he had no contact with them except for sending an anonymous Christmas present home each year. Pitts arrived at the University of Chicago in the late 1930s when he was 15 years old. There Rudolph Carnap referred Pitts to Nicolas Rashevsky's mathematics class, where Pitts met Jerome Lettvin, who introduced him to Warren McCulloch. (Nicolas Rashevsky (1899-1972) was a theoretical physicist at the University of Chicago.) Pitts later shifted to MIT where he became a protégé of Warren McCulloch.
The polymath Walter Pitts (1923-1969) was a 'student' of Rudolph Carnap and a disciple of Norbert Wiener. Pitts PhD dissertation theory of randomly connected neural nets languished and was never finished. Pitts made slow progress with his Ph.D. and then abandoned it. Wiener offered Pitts a PhD on the basis of already published work but Pitts declined the offer.



Pitts played a pivotal role in establishing the revolutionary notion of the brain as a computer. It was a seminal idea in the development of cybernetics.
Walter Pitts and Oliver Selfridge were doctoral students of Wiener. They were considered Wiener's 2 most talented doctoral students. Selfridge was described as "a creative thinker and researcher." Oliver Selfridge was a pioneering computer expert - a pioneer of artificial intelligence - and a member of Wiener's inner circle. Oliver Selfridge was the grandson of Harry Selfridge the (USA born) founder of London's fashionable Selfridges department store.
At MIT, Neumann, Wiener, McCulloch, and Pitts intended to construct a materialistic and mechanistic science of mental behaviour. They were part of The Teleological Society (also called the Cybernetics Group), under the aegis (sponsorship) of the Josiah Macy Foundation. McCulloch appears to be the cause of Wiener splitting from the group. (The immediate cause was an untruth connected with McCulloch that was told to Wiener by his wife Margaret who despised McCulloch.) McCulloch was described as having a "Bohemian lifestyle" which apparently was a euphemism for either "promiscuity" or "philandering." Shortly after the Wiener-McCulloch split Pitts began drinking heavily and became a near total recluse. Pitts burned his much anticipated doctoral dissertation, and also all of his notes and papers. Pitts died alone in 1969 in a Cambridge boarding house, aged 46, from bleeding esophageal varices.
See the study of Norbert Wiener: Dark Hero of the Information Age by Flo Conway and Jim Siegelman (2009).
According to Jerome Lettvin, Walter Pitts had a small influence on Hamlet's Mill. Walter Pitts engaged in numerous discussions with Hertha von Dechend. Before his death in 1969, Walter Pitts was actively involved with Hertha von Dechend in the "Hamlet's Mill project." He conducted research into Egyptian astronomy and also possible early knowledge of precession. It appears that all of what survives is the mention in von Dechend's course notes. In the seminar/course Introduction to Cosmology (1961, Page 117) de Santillana and von Dechend state: "Our rigorous friend, Mr Walter Pitts ... has kindly volunteered to help us, and to give a critical summary of Sir Norman Lockyer's work, The Dawn of Astronomy. ... [I]t is important to note that he too, concludes independently that Egyptian astronomy could not but know about Precession."
See: "Walter Pitts." by Neil Smalheiser in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, Volume 43, Number 2, Winter, 2000, Pages 217-226.
Excursus: The movie "Good Will Hunting" and Walter Pitts
Abe Aronow recalls: "When I first saw "Good Will Hunting", the Matt Damon movie, I recognized a lot of Walter Pitts in lead character. Lettvin confirmed my suspicion at a later conversation. I have no idea how that "lore" got into the script. I was personally present in 1961-62 when a full professor of EE came into the EEL with a 3 ft sq scroll of graph paper which he unrolled on the table showing a very complex circuit design covering almost the entire scroll. Lettvin, McCulloch, Pitts and several other students were there. The prof of EE whom I didn't know then, and whose name I do not recall, said something to the effect that, "this doesn't work and I don't know why". Lettvin and especially Pitts who were both "circuit savants" looked at it for less than 2 minutes and then Pitts pointed a finger at the paper and the EE prof's mouth dropped open in a manner not unlike the scene in the movie with the math prof and the unsolved math problem that the Damon character solved in a snap. The EE prof rolled up his circuit and left."
Walter Pitts never had official status for teaching or grading. Wiener promised Pitts a PhD in mathematics at MIT. This despite the fact that Pitts had never graduated from High School, and also that it was prohibited by the strict rules at the institution. When he was eventually offered his PhD, Pitts refused to sign the paperwork.
Pitts when not completely absorbed in his work would exhibit troubled behaviours. On account of his markedly odd behaviours and difficulties with social interaction it was thought he may have suffered from schizophrenia. It is thought that Walter Pitts may have committed suicide in 1969. (More reliably, it is indicated he died from the ill-health effects of alcoholism.) Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts collaborated on the following papers: "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity." (1943); "On how we know universals: The perception of auditory and visual forms." (1947). Norbert Wiener and Walter Pitts collaborated on the papers: "An Account of the Soike Potential of Axons." (1948); "A Statistical Analysis of Synaptic Excitation." (1949; full authorship: A. Rosenblueth, N. Wiener, W. Pitts, J. García Ramos).
Warren McCulloch would present speculation dressed up as fact. This was not properly understood by Norbert Wiener and caused him academic embarrassment. It has been stated that the serious mental decline suffered by Walter Pitts in 1952 (and his alcoholism) was in (large) part due to the feuding between Norbert Wiener and Warren McCulloch (and his group). The feud at least caused Pitts to abandon his slowly progressing PhD thesis.

Hoax publication by Jerome Lettvin and Walter Pitts
Jerome Lettvin was a prankster.
In 1943 Jerry Lettvin and Walter Pitts, both then in their early 20's, collaborated in a hoax. They coauthored a thoroughly nonsensical paper called "A Mathematical Theory of Affective Psychoses" which was published in The Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics, December, 1943, Volume 5, Issue 4, Pages 139-148. The paper comprised an invented mixture of mathematical equations and jargon having no sensible meaning or scientific merit. Abstract: "The theory introduces two variables ψ and ф. The first represents the intensity of emotion, the second measures the intensity of activity. A set of integrodifferential equations is assumed to govern the variation of ф and ψ with respect to time. Since for increasing values of ф the conduct of the organism varies from great impassivity through a normal level of feeling to extremes of a circular depression or catatonic excitement; whereas an increase of ψ results in a transition from stupor to manic excitement, the solutions of the equations represent quantitative specifications of different psychotic states." The paper concluded with the statement: "As remarked above, these are no periodic orbits in the large, and unless continually disturbed, the particle will ultimately settle toward one of the equilibria." According to Lettvin they were surprised to receive praise for the article and were also offered research funding (which they declined). Lettvin was fond of repeatedly telling people of the hoax. Not mentioned is whether papers for publication were refereed.



Teaching method used by Jerome Lettvin
Abe Aronow recalls that Jerome Lettvin actually used 'bullcrap' (nonsense) as a teaching tool.
Marc Abrahams writes (http://www.improbable.com/2011/04/26/jerry-lettvin-is-gone/): "Jerry has the curse and the gift of speaking in caricature, which can make his stories sound so good they feel apocryphal. In general, his craziest-sounding science stories are based on facts, with documentation aplenty if you’re willing to go look it up. Some scientists dismiss the stories, though. One told me: "Half of what Jerry Lettvin says is wrong. The trick is to figure out which half.""
Lettvin's undergraduate lectures/courses from the mid 1960s were taught jointly with de Santillana who provided a historical-philosophical perspective on the biological bases of knowledge and perception. (See: "'The Materials of Science, the Ideas of Science, and the Poetry of Science': Warren McCulloch and Jerry Lettvin." by Tara Abraham (Interdisciplinary Science Reviews, Volume 37, Number 3, September, 2012, Pages 169-186).)
The Neurophysiology Research Group at MIT
In 1951 Norbert Wiener (whose father, interestingly, was Leo Wiener the Harvard philologist) convinced Jerry Wiesner (president of MIT) to hire some physiologists of the nervous system (i.e., to establish a brain research group composed of mathematicians and physiologists of the nervous system). This was the Neurophysiology Research Group (established in the 1950s). “Adding a neurophysiology group to MIT’s Research Laboratory for Electronics was intended to more fully implement Wiener’s vision of a center for cybernetic ideas. MIT would, thus, become the institutional home to the fruits of the Macy conferences. All of which made a move to MIT in October 1952 seem eminently attractive.” (Entry: “McCulloch, Warren Sturgis” by Kenneth Aizawa, In: Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography (2008).) When finally established the group included Walter Pitts, Jerry Lettvin and Warren McCulloch. Walter Pitts soon wrote a lengthy thesis on the properties of neural nets connected in three dimensions. However, when Walter Pitts went into what has been described as 'cognitive suicide', a gradual but steep decline into social isolation, from which he never recovered, he burnt the manuscript on three dimensional networks and took little further interest in work. The only exception was a collaboration with Robert Gesteland which produced a paper on olfaction. Later Pitts began to live on his own in Cambridge. (During the 1960s, Pitts became increasingly withdrawn and more exclusively attached to Warren McCulloch.) Jerry Lettvin described Walter Pitts as being "in no uncertain sense the genius of the group ... when you asked him a question, you would get back a whole textbook."
Interestingly, as early as 1967, Professor JeromeWiesner (1915-1994, a senior professor of electrical engineering) discussed the possibility of building an experimental college at MIT that integrated science, engineering, arts, humanities.
The Neurophysiology Research Group established at MIT was, at one time, involved in 9 research projects. The group's research work was (initially) supported in part by Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc.; the National Institutes of Health (Grant B-1865-(C3), Grant B-2480(C1), Grant MP-4737); The Teagle Foundation, Inc.; and in part by the U.S. Air Force (Aeronautical Systems Division) under Contract AF33(616)-7783. The research interests of this group went further than simply physiology. Among the 20-25 members of this group (the membership fluctuated) was Hertha (spelled Herta) von Dechend. Jerome Lettvin and Walter Pitts was also members. Giorgio de Santillana was not a member of the group. Walter H. Pitts Junior (1923-1969) a logician who worked in the field of cognitive psychology at MIT, was teamed with a number of researchers on different research topics. Hertha von Dechend was teamed with Walter Pitts on the topic of: Evolution of Scientific Language. What exactly the content of their studies was is presently unknown to me. In one report-back by the entire group (RLE Progress Report No. 064 (1962) XXVII. Neurophysiology) von Dechend and Pitts simply state: "We intend to continue study of the origins of scientific language." Later: Herta von Dechend and Walter Pitts: "(g) Evolution of Scientific Language. We intend to continue study of the origin of scientific language." (Neurophysiology, MIT Report Number 64, Page 286.) There is the possibility that von Dechend joined this Group during her initial visit to the USA in 1960. (RLE = Research Laboratory of Electronics (at MIT).) The report was a quarterly progress report dated January 15, 1962 (Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Research Laboratory of Electronics. Quarterly Progress Report, Number 64). In his profile of Walter Pitts, Neil Smalheiser writes that Pitts engaged in many discussions with von Dechend. A passing reference to neurophysiology is made in Hamlet's Mill (Pages 71-72).
The study of von Dechend and Pitts into the origins of scientific language
It is unfortunate that no record/report seems to have survived regarding the study of von Dechend and Pitts into the origins of scientific language. (An eventual formal report is not indicated.) Likely their investigations would have included the structure of the primitive alphabet, the development of literary expression, measures (numerical notation), the development of poetry before prose, the importance of ars combinatoria, the relation between writing and divination, the connection of the letters of the alphabet with numbers, phonetics, belief that the world has hidden structure (based on topological structures, numbers, and probability), highly formalised structuring of thought, ciphers/cyptographics (hidden meaning), and artificial structuring. There is a limited discussion of language in Hamlet's Mill.
The relationships between the Research Laboratory of Electronics and the Neurophysiology Research Group
The Research Laboratory of Electronics was formed in 1946. The Neurophysiology Research Group was formed in the early 1950s (no earlier than 1951). Lettvin was employed at MIT by the Research Laboratory of Electronics. The Research Laboratory of Electronics was an interdepartmental laboratory of the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Physics. The Neurophysiology Research Group (= Neurophysiology Laboratory) was a group comprising a mixture of full-time (dedicated) academic member, academics from other MIT departments (permanent and transient involvement), graduate students (transient involvement), and academic visitors (transient involvement). (Different employment/engagement arrangements.) The Neurophysiology Research Group (Neurophysiology Laboratory) was formed within the Research Laboratory of Electronics. Its concept was an extension of the Research Laboratory of Electronics (and its investigations used Research Laboratory of Electronics equipment). Both the Research Laboratory of Electronics and the Neurophysiology Research Group were located in Building 20. (See: Dark Hero of the Information Age by Flo Conway and Jim Siegelman (2009).)
In the beginning the research objectives of the NRG were mainly concerned with synaptic transmission.
Basically, the persons forming the NRG (= the more general term Neurophysiology Laboratory) formed the basis for the informal group calling itself the Experimental Epistemology Laboratory. Jerome Lettvin's office at his Experimental Epistemology Laboratory was long a meeting place for numerous persons and all types of discussions. I would expect that such discussions often paralleled the interests of de Santillana.
Giorgio de Santillana's preoccupation with 'genius' and 'discovery'
Mark Stahlman (son of the eminent science historian William Stahlman) has enabled some insights into Giorgio de Santillana's time at MIT and the background to Hamlet's Mill. (Mark's Stahlman's father was a protégé of Norbert Wiener, beginning when his his father arrived at MIT just



before WW II.) It appears that Norbert Wiener (Professor of Mathematics at MIT, and also a capable historian) was a close collaborator with Giorgio de Santillana. Both wished to understand the nature of "genius" and "discovery." (Giorgio de Santillana was obviously not prepared to sweep aside the question of genius as many historians had frequently done.) Giorgio de Santillana was no doubt taken by the fact that many ancient cultures believed consciousness was not linear by cyclical. (Norbert Wiener had an interdisciplinary approach to his work and was known for his ability to find connections between mathematics and other fields.) In the mid-1950s Norbert Wiener turned his attention to the question of "genius." He shared his interest in "genius" with Giorgio de Santillana and other historians (both at MIT and elsewhere). Mark Stahlman believes that Hamlet's Mill is the primary statement of Norbert Wiener's investigations to understand how genius had functioned throughout history. It appears Norbert Wiener believed that the Greek-Egyptian polymath Ptolemy (Claudius Ptolemaeus, astronomer, mathematician, geographer, life dates circa 90-170 CE, resided in Roman Egypt) was the best example of genius in history.
By the early 1940s Norbert Wiener was a friend and collaborator of de Santillana.
Giorgio de Santillana believed that genius and the origin of scientific discovery is to be found in the Neolithic Period. Hertha von Dechend believed that she had discovered one expression of this Neolithic Period genius and discovery, namely, knowledge of precession transmitted through mythology as a technical language. A variety of ancient/early myths were specifically designed to transmit information about precession and its observed effects. This Neolithic knowledge of precession was not general but involved the knowledge of the scientifically accurate rate of procession through an established zodiac of 12 equal divisions. Eric Voegelin in a 1970 letter to (the German prehistorian) Marie Köenig (See: Selected Correspondence 1950-1984 (2007) by Eric Voegelin et al writes "Santillana formulates it specifically as the transmission of the inorganic and biological developmental period to the human period, in which things are simply approached differently.") In his delayed publication of Order and History, Volume 4: The Ecumenic Age (1974), Eric Voegelin endorsed Hamlet's Mill by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend (1969) and added new arguments. See page 132 onwards.
It is baffling that von Dechend believed it was possible to conduct 'mental archaeology' into the remnants of ancient preliterate cultures. History is largely concerns the study of the past through written evidence. Archaeology is primarily concerned with the artefacts or objects left by past societies. It is a subject that involves problem-solving and sophisticated use of evidence and theoretical argument.
Giorgio de Santillana and the Vienna Circle
By the early 1940s there was in the Greater Boston area a critical mass of expatriates, including Giorgio de Santillana,who later appeared on the roster of the meetings of the reconstituted Vienna Circle in Exile. Other locations became centres of closely related groups across the USA.
Giorgio de Santillana's "project group" at MIT
Giorgio de Santillana had a practice of assigning persons (including students) to study various topics related to the "Hamlet's Mill project." It would be interesting to know just how much of this was utilised by Hertha von Dechend and incorporated into her chaotic seminar notes.
The MIT course notes with the title, Introduction to Cosmology: A Preliminary Reconnaissance by H. von Dechend [and] G. de Santillana, originally issued in 1961 as 152 pages of notes for the topic "Ancient Cosmology" within the regular Humanities course (XXI-B), enable some insight. These notes supported the course topic "Ancient Cosmology" which ran at least 1961-1962 and was presented by de Santillana and von Dechend. It appears that eventually some 100 supplementary pages were issued. The overall purpose of the course was to establish a basis for a school of comparative celestial culture, and also establish a student Hamlet's Mill project group. The MIT course notes, Introduction to Ancient Cosmology by Hertha von Dechend and issued in 1966 also enables some insight. Introductory comments strongly imply the course has also been presented 1964-1965. Also, these are new course notes with a different approach to presenting the material, to enable better understanding by students of the theme being promoted. It appears that from 1961 to 1965 Humanities students undertaking the "Ancient Cosmology" module were experiencing difficulty in understanding the ideas being presented.
Mark Stahlman states that William Stahlman was a member of Giorgio de Santillana's "project group" contributing towards Hamlet's Mill. Mark Stahlman also states that William Stahlman was a protégé of Giorgio de Santillana and was perhaps encouraged by him to study the genius of Ptolemy and his discoveries. It is difficult to accept Mark Stahlman's claim that William Stahlman was the primary resource for Hamlet's Mill. At the time of his early death in 1975 William Stahlman was with the Department of History of Science, University of Wisconsin. William Stahlman, later to become a science historian and Ptolemy specialist, was a student of Giorgio de Santillana at MIT. (He was a Class of 1948, Course XXI Humanities graduate.) More broadly he was a student of Greek and pre-Greek mathematical astronomy. In 1960 William Stahlman earned a Ph.D. from Brown University, History of Mathematics Department, under Otto Neugebauer. His doctoral dissertation was: The astronomical tables of Codex Vaticanus graecus 1291. William Stahlman had already taught at MIT, Harvard University, and University of Wisconsin prior to gaining his Ph.D. (At the time of his employment (tenureship) at University of Wisconsin in 1960 he was completing his Ph.D.) At University of Wisconsin he taught courses in science in antiquity until his death in 1975 from serious illness. In March 1963 William Stahlman gave a talk at MIT on early astronomy.
William Stahlman and Harald Reiche collaborated with Giorgio de Santillana in, Memorandum on Greek Science (circa 1955, 33 pages typewritten manuscript). Sub-titled Greek Science in Three Acts. I Advance. II Challenge and Response. III Retreat and Dissolution. On the title page: "In addition to the use made of this memorandum in H11, students should keep it for reference in H12, Spring Term, 1955."
While a student at MIT and a member of Giorgio de Santillana's "project group" Abe (Abraham) Aronow states he worked on the mythological and cosmological references in the Midrash and the Zohar. In a letter to Isaiah Berlin at Oxford, dated February 14, 1967, de Santillana writes: "... Abe [has] ... engaged with me in a study of archaic cosmology ...." Abe Aronow's 1962 undergraduate thesis was on the Midrash and Zohar. (This was directed by Giorgio de Santillana. Some people believe that this type of Jewish material contains precessional references. Some persons believe the secret doctrine of the Kabbalah and other Jewish mystical books/writing is precession. The Kabbalah contains what are deemed to be precessional numbers. As examples: Divine names, such as the Shemhamphorash a corruption of the Hebrew term Shem ha-Mephorash ("the explicit Name [of God]," (name of 72 letters). Also, the 72 arrangements of the Tetragrammaton, or the 4-lettered name of God (i.e., the god Yahweh) in Hebrew. These 4 letters can be combined in 72-two combinations, resulting in what is called the Shemhamforesh. In early Kabbalah, the term was used to designate sometimes a 72-letter name for God (i.e., the god Yahweh), and sometimes a 42-letter name. In the Jewish mysticism of the Kabbalah, there are 72 sacred names for God in the Zohar. Also, according to the Zohar: the 72 old men of the synagogue; and the 72 degrees of Jacob's ladder. See also the somewhat odd book: The Universal Kabbalah: Deciphering Cosmic Code in the Sacred Geometry of the Sabbath Star Diagram by Leonora Leet (2004, Page 122).) In her earlier book, Doctrine of the Kabbalah (1994, Page 94) Leonora Leet Ph.D. claims the Sefer Yetzirah "perpetuates a unified cosmology that goes back to Neolithic times and was spread over the entire globe."
Note: The Zohar (a group of books written in medieval Aramaic and medieval Hebrew and unified under the one name) is the central text of the Jewish Kabbalah, the Jewish mystical tradition. The bulk of the Zohar consists of a running commentary on – and mystical interpretation of (in a



unique and metaphorical language) - the Torah, from Genesis through Deuteronomy. The Zohar first appeared in Spain in the 13th-century, and was published by a Jewish writer named Moses ben Shem-Tov de Leon (who claimed it was passed down from the 2nd-century CE - written by Rabbi Simeon Bar Yohai (and his students), Yohai was one of the Tannaim, the Mishnaic sages of the 2nd century CE). Modern scholarship concludes that the Zohar was likely written by the man who claimed only to have 'discovered' it; Moses ben Shem-Tov de Leon (1250-1305) of Avila, Spain.
Astronomy and Mythological Cosmology and Cosmogony in the Midrash Rabba and Zohar by Abraham Aronow (May 12, 1962, Department of Humanities, Course XXI-B, Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, June, 1962 [103 Pages]). Extracts: "Acknowledgements [Page 3]. I would like to thank Dr, Hertha von Dechend and Professor Giorgio de Santillana for their inspiration and assistance. I would like, also, to thank Miss Susan B. Chase and Miss Barbara R. Leopold for their technical assistance." "Preface [Page 4, 2/6/62] In the very recent past I have been a small part of a large inquiry into the similarities that existed in many diverse ancient cultures. The inquiry has been mainly concerned with the astronomy, the cosmology, the cosmogony, and the accompanying mythological accounts of "the Creation" in the early civilizations of this planet. The prime movers of this project, my advisors and my constant inspiration, are Dr. Hertha von Dechend and Prof. Giorgio de Santillana. It is my hope that my small contribution will be of use to them in the later, correlative aspects of their study." "Second Preface [Pages 5-6, 4/21/62]. In the course of writing the body of my thesis, I have been very apprehensive, for I feared that 21.85 might be a necessary prerequisite for a lucid reading of this paper. 21.85 is catalogued as "Introduction to Cosmology" and is a seminar designed to perform a preliminary reconnaissance into cosmological patterns, both ancient and modern. The purpose of this reconnaissance is to establish a basis for a school of comparative celestial culture. This new field is an interesting synthesis of: astrology, mythology anthropology, and history of science. The seminar (1961-62) was composed of students of varied background and divergent interests. The lack of homogeneity in the group was the key to its great success. Prof. de Santillana and Dr. von Dechend gave preliminary lectures and a reading list and then each individual selected the corridor of research which most suited his abilities and interests. At one meeting, Prof. de Santillana named the group, "the crazy cosmology club"; the name has stuck. This name seems to typify the average outsider's attitude towards the seeming lack of rigour in our investigative techniques. I shall try, in the following introduction, to dispell some of the reader's fears concerning the apparent investigative randomness of this research technique, and to delineate clearly the exact aims, boundaries and goals of my own contribution. I would strongly recommend that the reader secure and read a copy of An Introduction to Cosmology by Dechend and de Santillana prior to reading this paper. I choose to investigate Hebrew literature because I am fortunate enough to be fairly facile in that language. Prior to the organization of the cosmology seminar I had several occasions to be of assistance to Prof. de Santillana and Dr. von Dechend because of my Hebrew. Several other students in the seminar also chose topics which were related to a Foreign language in which they could read primary source material."
Abe Aronow vaguely recalls that other undergraduates worked on Maya and Polynesian material.
This makes it clear that (at least some) undergraduate students studying for their bachelor degree within the Department of Humanities (at least at this time) completed a thesis relevant to the research interests of de Santillana and von Dechend in ancient astronomy. The seminars aided this student effort. The courses notes for these particular seminars were prepared by von Dechend. (Some recent PhD dissertations give support to Hamlet's Mill. Uncritical and uninformed support for Hamlet's Mill appears in pages 13-14 of the 2010/2011 PhD dissertation, An interdisciplinary study of time in language and mind by Roberto Bottini.)
The continued existence of 'project group' theses remains unknown. The location of these theses, if retained, would be in the MIT Collections headed Humanities - Bachelor's degree (Theses - Department of Humanities > Humanities - Bachelor's degree). Example: Newton and the Origin of Spectroanalysis by William Joseph Bisson. Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Science [Department of Humanities] at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, June 1960. Bisson, in his Preface, thanks Professor William H. Dennen, of the M.I.T. Department of Geology, and Professor Giorgio deSantillana (sic) of the Department of Humanities for their guidance in the experimental and historical aspects of the thesis. The title page of the thesis bears the stamp mark: "Mass. Inst. Of Technology Library Jul 26 1960."
Excursus: The claim that Giorgio de Santillana was mentor for Kenneth Caneva PhD, an historian of science at University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG), appears erroneous. Caneva entered Princeton's graduate program in the History and Philosophy of Science in the fall of 1967. There he was a student of Thomas Kuhn. He received his PhD from Princeton University in 1975 and joined the UNCG faculty in the spring of 1979. He departed UNCG as Professor, Emeritus (2010). MIT's Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology appointed him a senior fellow for 1999-2000. In November 2006 he informed me he had never heard of any Ancient Cosmology seminars at MIT. (Indicates they were not widely or actively publicised or he had little connection with MIT and Giorgio de Santillana?) Perhaps there has been confusion with William Stahlman.

Stahlman, science historian at the University of Wisconsin is completing work on a three volume study showing the connection between global myth and the history of astronomy. Focusing his attention on Babylonian astronomy, he stated in his lecture, "Science in Antiquity, that astronomical myth studies are extremely complex and as he said, "More frankly they are in a premature stage, in my own mind, for public presentation."" Note: Matt will be identifiable as Matt Shakespeare, a contributor at that time to the Erindalian. (By September 1973 at least, he was the editor.) Interestingly, at no time before or after the lecture, was the name error J. D. Stahlman corrected to W. D. Stahlman. Whether the presenters stayed for the 2 days or simply turned up, presented, and left soon after - without really meeting each other - is unknown.



The above few clippings - and an essay by William Stahlman in the Saturday Review - seem all that remains to identify Stahlman's proposed book and its thesis. It is indicated that it (largely) mimics Hamlet's Mill (i.e. precessional zodiacal world ages). His apparent point of difference is the astronomical interpretation of myth. Stahlman made the point of the difficulty of immediately [easily] translating myth into scientific terminology. For von Dechend the supposed structure of the Ur-myth involved the following 6 features at least: (1) astronomy, (2) arithmetic, (3) geometry, (4) alchemy, (5) metrology, and (6) harmonics. All these subjects throughout the world all belong to an Urtext. Nothing similar is identifiable in Stahlman's 1970 paper.
William Duane Stahlman was born in Clarion, Pennsylvania, May 27, 1923 to Harry Earl Stahlman and Myrtle Stahlman (née Jolly). There were 4 other siblings. (Hid father Harry was born on September 21, 1881, in Clarion, Pennsylvania. His mother Myrtle was born on March 11, 1890.) At least until 1940 he remained living in Pennsylvania. At age 24, William Stahlman married Rita Byrnes in 1947 and they had 3 [4?, Donald Jolly Stahlman] children: Robert Stahlman, Mark Stahlman, and Mary Lou Stahlman. (His son Mark D. Stahlman is Director, Center for the Study of Digital Life. Stevens Institute of Technology. Hoboken, New Jersey.) William Stahlman died at his residence of an illness on March 27, 1975, in Wisconsin, aged 51 years.
From Stahlman's PhD Dissertation, Page. iii: "After being graduated from the Clarion Senior High School in l941, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and following his graduation in l948, with the degree of S.B. in Mathematics, he taught at Amherst College for two years. In 1950 he was awarded the M.A. degree in Philosophy by Amherst College. From 1950 to 1953 he was a resident graduate student at Brown University in the Department of the History of Mathematics. Since 1953 he has taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During the fall semester of 1957 he taught at Brandeis University also."

Dr. William D. Stahlman from The Oil City Derrick [newspaper published in Oil City, Pennsylvania], April 1, 1975: "CLARION - Dr. William D. Stahlman, 51, of Madison, Wis., a professor at the University of Wisconsin and a former faculty member at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, died at his residence Thursday (March 27, 1975). A native of Clarion, he was born May 27, 1923, a son of Dr. Harry E. and Myrtle Jolly Stahlman. He graduated from Clarion High School in 1941, later from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was awarded a Ph.D. from Brown University (In Rhode Island). He was teaching the history of science at the University of Wisconsin at the time of his death. Dr. Stahlman was national administrator of the Scrutineers Sports Cars of America. He was a member of the United Methodist Church and a World War II veteran. He is survived by his wife, the former Rita Byrnes of Madison; two sons, Mark Stahlman of New York City and Kent Stahlman of Milwaukee, Wis.; a daughter Mary Lou Stahlman of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; his mother, Mrs. Harry E. Stahlman of Brownsville, Texas; a sister, Mrs. A. E. Kunselman of Indiana, Pa., and a brother, Dr. Robert K. Stahlman of Dallas, Texas."
According to Mark Stahlman, his father, had been a protégé of Norbert Wiener's since the early 1940s, when he arrived from rural Pennsylvania as an MIT undergraduate on a Westinghouse scholarship. Dr. William Duane Stahlman, obtained his S.B. at MIT. (The S.B., Latin for "scientiae baccalaureus," is the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) undergraduate degree. His B.S. was in mathematics. His M.A. was in philosophy.) Wiener thought that the remarkable people that are geniuses would continue to appear and that leaving a record of geniuses who had come before would be useful to future geniuses, particularly for the scientists. This apparently was the basis, or part of it, for persuading William Stahlman to become a historian of science (particularly the history of ancient mathematics), under the tutelage of Giorgio de Santillana. William Stahlman later earned his PhD at Brown University, under Otto Neugebauer. (W. D. Stahlman, "The astronomical tables of Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1291", unpublished PhD thesis, Brown University, 1959. The dissertation includes an edition of Ptolemy's Handy Tables. Available from University Microfilms. Also, it was planned to be published by Garland (date unknown) circa 1970.) William Stahlman became one of the world's leading experts on the life and contributions of the 2nd-century Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer/astrologer and geographer Claudius Ptolemy. During the course of his academic career he also learned to read 18 ancient languages.

By the mid 1950s at least, William D. Stahlman was in the History of Science Department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He moved from MIT, when he was assistant professor of the history of science, to the Department of the History of Science, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, in September 1960. He continued his post as Treasurer of the History of Science Society. In 1960 William Duane Stahlman was awarded a PhD from the Department of Egyptology & Department of the History of Mathematics, Brown University, for his dissertation "The astronomical tables of Codex Vaticanus graecus 1291." His job placement that followed was: Professor of History of Science, University of Wisconsin, Madison.
Stahlman's academic specialty was the history of ancient and Renaissance science. In the 1960s, when most American historians of science did not work in the area of the ancient history of science, Stahlman was specifically working in ancient Ptolemaic astronomy. (His hobby was cars.) Stahlman's undergraduate lectures varied from (1) the history of Babylonian mathematics to (2) the history of the automobile.
William Stahlman published an edited version of Ptolemy's Handy Tables, at a time when this work was generally ignored.
At the time of his early death Prof. William Duane Stahlman (1923-1975), Department of History of Science, University of Wisconsin was apparently "completing work" on a 3-volume history of astronomy. The general content was global mythology. The fate of the unpublished manuscript is unknown. It appears that Stahlman presented 2 public lectures on "Science in Antiquity" (1963 at MIT and 1973 at Erindale College) but perhaps without including a summary of his book material. This is indicated at least for 1973. Why he would publish an overview of his ideas in January 1970 but decline to present them in a lecture in March 1973 is somewhat puzzling. I have been reliably informed by a past student that in the late 1980s the late Prof. David Lindberg had - in an office filing cabinet - unpublished research material by Professor William Stahlman. Lindberg was hoping that someone might "carry on" the material. The identification of this material now seems unlikely.
To what extent Stahlman invoked precession can be identified from his January 10, 1970 article in the Saturday Review. It is a 'mirror' of Hamlet's Mill. It is interesting that Stahlman is not mentioned in either the Bibliography or Index of Hamlet's Mill. The relationship between Stahlman and his (supposed) manuscript and de Santillana and von Dechend and Hamlet's Mill is perhaps now unable to be worked out. Stahlman's 1970 article also carries the statement: "Wisconsin University science historian William D. Stahlman's three-volume study of Ptolemy, now in process, explores the role of archaic science in myth." It seems indicated that Ptolemy was a key focus of the 3-volume study.
William Stahlman on Hamlet's Mill
HAMLET'S MILL AN ESSAY ON MYTH AND THE FRAME OF TIME Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend. "Two learned and visionary historians of science unravel a complex skein of motifs that run fugue-like through ancient myths of all cultures. Their dramatic search leads to the far-reaching discovery that preliterate man used myth as a code to transmit highly sophisticated astronomical observations. ''Recommended source reading."" — Professor William D. Stahlman, Saturday Review.
Hamlet's Mill approach to mythology reportedly led to major problems getting it published. Its attempt to illustrate that myth is actually often a "scientific" description of our sensory observations about the heavens undercut the approach of mythicists such as Joseph Campbell's and Carl Jung's as a misuse of mythology.
Mark Stahlman posted at his website: "[Giorgio de Santillana] ... who, according to my mother, brought roses to her the day after I was born. In particular, he [WDS] was assigned to the history of ancient mathematics. Indeed, after taking his PhD at Brown (under Otto Neugebauer), and learning to read 18 extinct languages, Bill Stahlman became one of the world's leading experts on the life and contributions of 2nd century Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer/astrologer and geographer Claudius Ptolemy. No doubt, that was a genius worth remembering. Giorgio, the bon-vivant who Wiener was concerned about getting hauled up in front of HUAC, is perhaps best known for his 1955 The Crime of Galileo. More substantially, in terms of the Genius Project, although fraught with its own stories of publishing sabotage is his 1969 Hamlet's Mill: An Essay on Myth & the Frame of Time, in which he posits that what we call myth is actually a record of highly accurate ancient cosmological observations. While, not stated in the book, this stands in sharp contrast to the widely held (including, it appears by Gregory Bateson) Jungian notion that myths reflect the collective unconscious. According to my father, Giorgio heavily relied on his collection of ancient manuscripts in the preparation of Hamlet's Mill For Giorgio, and his co-author Hertha von Dechend, history can be best understood as a series of discoveries followed by forgetting, then once again followed by a renewed period of remembering. In this view, humanity is destined to go through cycles of ignorance and wisdom. So, Giorgio, Norbert and my father, indeed all of us might well ask: where, in that cycle, are we now? V. Cybernation Walter Reuther didn't forget about Wiener, even if the cybernetician had been taken out by the Cold War Feds in the early 50s."
In recent years a number of scholars have urged that universal myths and other ancient writings need decoding for the truths they contain about man's past. As one example of many that could be cited, William Stahlman urged a new approach to the study of prehistory. He notes that modern man revels in the denial that ancient myth has truth value, that historians have blinded themselves to essential clues that lie right before their eyes, and that they misuse the biological seedbed of evolution by trying to apply evolution to history. He scolds the simplistic notion that all fields of knowledge are very modern and that they simply evolved (Saturday Review, 1/10/70, page100). In sharp contrast to scholars who urge that we extract truth from myths, evolutionists attempt to force captive audiences into believing that the Bible is only myth.
Hamlet's Mill was described by Mark Stahlman as "a very strange counter-mythology book."

A short newspaper article on Stahlman, "UW Scholar Seeks Babylonian Error", appeared in The La Crosse Tribune (La Crosse, Wisconsin) Sunday, December 3, 1961, Page 14. (To do with error(s) in the Plimpton Tablet.) The newspaper article noted that William D. Stahlman was one of six researchers in this country [USA] in the history of ancient science.
The 5 short articles included in the Saturday Review for January 10, 1970 are basically a sampling of Hamlet's Mill ideas:
Lear, John. (1970). "The Star-Fixed Ages of Man." (Saturday Review, January 10, Pages 99-100). The influence of Hamlet's Mill on John Lear is evident.
Stahlman, William. (1970). "The Star-Fixed Ages of Man-2: Global Myths Record Their Passage." (Saturday Review, January 10, Pages 100-103). Stahlman states that "Hamlet's Mill is both controversial and exciting; it is essential reading for anyone in the least intrigued by mythology." Whether Stahlman's article - I think obviously written for the Saturday Review - was requested by John Lear and why is not known. It forms a triplet with Lear's article and the extract from Hamlet's Mill.

Other Publications by William Stahlman
Stahlman did some computationally based work. Whilst at MIT Stahlman published, with Owen Gingerich, a book giving Solar and Planetary Longitudes for Years -2500 to +2500 (1963); appearing about the same time as the Tuckerman tables (1962, 1964, ...). Stahlman and Gingerich produced their ephemeris by computer calculation, using the tables of P. V. Neugebauer, which are reprinted in their book. The project was suggested by Stahlman.
"On the Date of a Comet Ascribed to A.D. 1238." (Isis, Volume 43, 1952, Pages 348-351).
"Astronomical Dating App1ied to a Type of Astrological Illustration." (Isis, Volume 47, 1956, Pages l54-160).
Stahlman edited a new edition (wrote an extensive (120 page) commentary) of the only printed edition of the Handy Tables, Commentaire de Théon sur les Tables manuelles astronomiques de Ptolémée translated and edited by l'abbé Nicolas Halma, 3 volumes, 1822–1825.
William Stahlman's, The Astronomical Tables of Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1291 (PhD dissertation, Brown University, 1960) was published in 2000.
Some key statements in Stahlman's 1970 paper and in the 1973 Erindalian
"I will deal here with a sub-set of myth: that portion of myth presently believed by many scholars to contain genuine scientific observation. Lest the word sub-set suggest that only a small percentage of mythology is involved, let me say at the outset that the case is quite the opposite. Virtually all of the major myths of all early cultures are involved, from the well-known Gilgamesh Epic of Mesopotamia and the Book of the Dead of Egypt to the lesser-known Icelandic myth of Amlodhi and the Polynesian Muri Ranga Whenua. As we shall see, the common thread is astronomical/cosmological knowledge." (Stahlman, William. (1970). "The Star-Fixed Ages of Man-2: Global Myths Record Their Passage." (Saturday Review, January 10, Page 100).) Note: Stahlman also stated the difficulty of immediately [easily] translating myth into scientific terminology.
"But the new approach is quite different in spirit and in method. It begins with a clear acknowledgment of the impossibility of reconstructing the original order of things human. Verified historical events will no more explain myth than will my wrist watch explain time. Whatever our tools and whatever our data, reconstructions are at best ambiguous and elusive. Words today, even as in antiquity, evoke while often failing clearly to denote. We are forced to attempt to trace themes and echoes of themes. We cannot expect quantified analyses, correct to the fourth decimal point." (Stahlman, William. (1970). "The Star-Fixed Ages of Man-2: Global Myths Record Their Passage." (Saturday Review, January 10, Page 101).
"A science historian at the University of Wisconsin, Dr. J.(sic)D. Stahlman, is completing work on a three-volume study showing the connection between global myth and the history of astronomy. He believes pre-historic men observed the skies in an organized way, long enough ago to reckon time in star-fixed ages, rather than man-timed centuries." (The Erindalian, Volume 5, Issue 16[-17], February 27, 1973, Page 5.)
"Professor J. (sic) D. Stahlman, science historian at the University of Wisconsin is completing work on a three volume study showing the connection between global myth and the history of astronomy. Focusing his attention on Babylonian astronomy, he stated in his lecture, "Science in Antiquity, that astronomical myth studies are extremely complex and as he said, "More frankly they are in a premature stage, in my own mind, for public presentation."" (The Erindalian, Volume 5, Number 18[-19], March 13, 1973, Page 2.)
William Stahlman urged a new approach to the study of prehistory. It is a misuse to try and apply the concept of biological evolution to history. Ancient myth has truth value and global myths and ancient writings need decoding for the truth's they contain about mankind's past.
Note: The Erindalian was issued by multiple student staff - with rapid turnover. The editor in February 1973 was Ihor Pelech and the key editors in March 1973 are indicated as Tanya Abolins and Paul Moran. It is likely that these people have included the statement that William Stahlman was working on a 3-volume study showing the connection between global myth and the history of astronomy John Lear, the science editor for Saturday Review in 1970 was likely/obviously the person who included/inserted the statement to Stahlman's paper that William Stahlman was working on a 3-volume study of Ptolemy: "Wisconsin University science historian William D. Stahlman's three-volume study of Ptolemy, now in process, explores the role of archaic science in myth." The slightly different descriptions are interesting. It is worth noting that nowhere is there any statement able to be directly attributed to William Stahlman that he is working on/has nearly completed a 3-volume manuscript on historical astronomy. It is unclear whether the recommended source reading included on page 102 with Stahlman's paper was provided by Stahlman or by Lear (the editor). It is clear that Stahlman is not drawing from any unpublished manuscript that he apparently has. The 3 books recommended are (1) Hamlet’s Mill, (2) Before Philosophy, and (3) Stonehenge Decoded. Publication dates are not given. (Gerald Hawkins is mentioned on page 69 of Hamlet's Mill. Before Philosophy (and its main author Henri Frankfort) is not mentioned in Hamlet's Mill.) However, 2 different editors, 3 years



apart and unknown to each other, are in agreement that William Stahlman is working on a 3-volume history of astronomy. There is no denial/correction by Stahlman regarding the statements. Somehow, William Stahlman must be the source.
Stahlman was correct that myth studies are extremely complex. Deciphering myths is a tricky task. Myths are often equivocal and it is all too easy for someone to impose their own astronomical meaning on them. What is really wanted is the intended meaning(s) of myths. When people like Hertha von Dechend assume to be astral mythologists and impose a single global astronomical theory on myths drawn from different cultures and at different periods of time they are engaging in a fantasy. The problem with their claims is that nothing in their claims is explicit within the myths they use.
Examining myths for astronomical content can be straightforward/undemanding. As examples: (1) The Babylonian Enuma Elish myth states that in the beginning the god the supreme Marduk established the celestial paths of the "three stars each" and the regular cycle of lunar phases. (2) Puebloan origin myths (which feature lack of consistency) state that after the emergence from the underworld, in a holy place called Sipapu, the people encountered 4 cardinal directions defined by sunrise and sunset at the winter and summer solstices on the horizon and associated with colours (Hopi), or 4 cardinal directions associated with sacred mountains and trees (Keresan), or a regular cycle of name months (Zuni). These are explicit statements of different astronomical concepts being expressed within a mythological construction. The astronomical concepts are readily understandable.
The arguments and conclusions in Hamlet’s Mill are not clear. Much too often the authors resort to hints, allusions, or throwaway questions. So much so that threads of reason become more tangled than is necessary. Another example: Sullivan's, Secret of the Incas needs to be treated with extreme caution. Some more reputable studies of various aspects of Incaic and related Andean astronomies include: (1) Brian Bauer and David Dearborm, Astronomy and Empire: The Cultural Origins of Inca Sky Watching (1995). (2) Mariusz Ziolkowski and Robert Sadowski, Time and Calendars in the Inca Empire (1989). (3) Mariusz Ziolkowski and Robert Sadowski, La Arqueoastronomia en la investigacion de las culturas Andinas (1992). (4) Anthony Aveni, The Lines of Nazca (1990).
William Stahlman's 1970 paper
This paper appears to be the only publication/presentation by William Stahlman on astronomical mythology. Reproduced as 'fair use' for the purposes of education, criticism and comment.
John Lear
John Lear was considered one of the leading American science writers. For 17 years his title was "science editor" of the respected literary magazine Saturday Review. (However, the magazine was not without its critics, and John Lear was not without his critics.) John Lear was also American correspondent of the New Scientist journal, a UK-based weekly English-language international science magazine. During the late 1960s at least, Lear's co-editor at the Saturday Review was John Fuller. John Fuller became a believer in the reality of UFOs (as alien spacecraft) and in 1966 published, The Interrupted Journey-Two Lost Hours Aboard A Flying Saucer. (About the alleged abduction by aliens of Betty and Barney Hill.)
John Lear was interested in the history of astronomy - in 1965 he published Kepler's Dream - but, as his Saturday Review paper shows, he did not have an adequate understanding of ancient astronomy.
John Lear was one of the few supporters of Hamlet's Mill outside of MIT. (The same can be said of William Stahlman.)
A January 2018 search for evidence of a 3-volume manuscript
The issue seems to be the reliability of William Stahlman that he was working on a 3-volume manuscript dealing with astronomical mythology. He never mentioned or discussed this project with colleagues at University of Wisconsin, Madison. It seems he only mentioned his project to a journal editor in 1970 with publication of his paper and also to a journal editor in 1973 for an advertised talk he did not give ("Science in Antiquity"); a substitute talk (same title, "Science in Antiquity") on Babylonian astronomy being given instead. The change in talk content only being announced at the time of presentation: Saturday, March 3 at 8.00pm. Because the length of the talks given by the presenters are indicated as 60-90 minutes duration William Stahlman must have prepared his substitute/alternative talk some time beforehand - most likely simply using his lecture material. This would have entailed a minimum of preparation time. I presume overheads were used. There is no indication that any notes were issued to participants.
The "search for evidence" was comprised of a "request for assistance" to Hastro-L; to several present and past academics at University of Wisconsin, Madison; and to UW Archives and Records Management (425 Steenbock Library). The result was a surprising amount of valuable information after a gap of nearly 45 years since William Stahlman's death. All replies were from accomplished academics.
Combined (edited) summary of information from 5 persons (mostly current and retired academics. some past students of William Stahlman) provided in their responses:
Stahlman at MIT
At MIT Stahlman conducted courses in ancient science in the late 1960s and early 1970s. [Note: Stahlman also conducted a course on the history of Babylonian mathematics.]
The references in Stahlman's article, to Frankfort's Before Philosophy and Hawkins's Stonehenge Decoded match the readings in Stahlman's ancient science course during the 1968-1969 term.
Stahlman did some computationally based work. Whilst at MIT Stahlman published, with Owen Gingerich, a book giving Solar and Planetary Longitudes for Years -2500 to +2500 (1963); appearing about the same time as the Tuckerman tables (1962, 1964, ...).
Stahlman at Brown University
One of Stahlman's class handouts was a sexagesimal multiplication table that later appeared in Neugebauer's HAMA (1975), Pages 1128-1129 as Table 5. It is likely Stahlman did the computations when he was Neugebauer's student.
Stahlman at UW



From at least 1969 the works Stahlman cites (de Santillana and von Dechend, Hawkins, and Frankfort) in his 1970 article correspond to those he referenced in his graduate class.
A number of people at UW who knew Stahlman during the early 1970s had serious doubts about whether he was as committed to his scholarly studies as he had once been.
Stahlman had an excellent library [personal/UW property] in his office, which it took him several years to get organized, but he was only at UW for two days a week, and these two days were taken up with teaching.
[Note: At UW at Madison, Stahlman also taught classes on the history of Babylonian mathematics, as well as on ancient science.]
Stahlman's Research
Ptolemy was a more respectable topic than ancient myth, so Stahlman may have been using Ptolemy to enhance his credentials.
Knowledge of Stahlman's Magus Opus
[Note: It appears that most people had no knowledge of Stahlman's magnus opus either by sighting it or by general conversation.]
Stahlman's proposed magnum opus was never seen. [Note: This includes by students and colleagues at MIT and UW.]
It was general knowledge ("constantly mentioned") that Stahlmanl had a large project underway on Ptolemy: This puts weight on the 1970 description in Saturday Review rather than the 1973 advertisements/review from the Erindale College seminar.
Any material of Stahlman's proposed three-volume magnum opus that may have gone to David Lindberg, since Lindberg had Stahlman's notes, may have gone astray when Lindberg was taken by Alzheimer's disease.
Stahlman's MA thesis at Amherst was on Aristotle's philosophy of mathematics. This comprised a stark contrast with the mythological approach of the de Santillana group and with Neugebauer's opposition to philosophy.
In the late 1980s', Lindberg showed a graduate student some files in his office filing cabinet that he identified as research/writing of Stahlman's that Lindberg was hoping some graduate student ("in the program") might "carry on." If Lindberg had material to do with Stahlman's magnus opus then he said nothing to others. It is most likely he would have told at least one other person if something like this existed. If Lindberg had kept such material in his own files, then the files are now gone.
Lindberg thought highly of Stahlman's work.
I know nothing about such a manuscript. [Note: A usual response.]
The Lindbergs moved to a retirement community early in 2010 and their daughter made sure that they "downsized" drastically. [Note: I think the reference made to Oakwood is a reference to Oakwood Common, a non-profit Continuing Care Retirement Community.]
No one on the committee that met after Stahlman's death to write up a memorial resolution had reason to suspect that the world had been deprived of a magnum opus.
Regarding the fate of Bill Stahlman's three-volume manuscript on the history of astronomy. If David Lindberg ever once had the manuscript, he was quiet about it. This is difficult to imagine as happening, but only if he thought that the manuscript really did not amount to much.
Over the years, at least one person who knew Stahlman wondered about whether such a manuscript ever existed and what might have become of it if it did exist. It seems nobody ever heard Stahlman mention the manuscript in conversation.
There is little chance of Stahlman's manuscript being placed away somewhere in a file box with other material from the days when History of Science at Wisconsin was a separate department.
Stahlman never mentioned the progress that he was making on what would have been a monumental book. The possibility that Stahlman had a manuscript in progress/underway that he chose not to tell people much about cannot be discounted.
I never queried Stahlman about his proposed manuscript. [Note: Nobody seems to have queried Stahlman about his manuscript.]
Ptolemy was one of Stahlman's real interests.
William Stahlman prided himself on being a master auto mechanic qualified to work on any sort of car, and he talked animatedly about his undergraduate course on the history of the automobile.
Influences on Stahlman
What Stahlman taught in his graduate classes on ancient science focused on Greek and Babylonian antiquity. Likely his three volume study would have also focused on in graduate classes, Greek and Babylonian antiquity,
Amongst sources that influenced him Stahlman was also influenced by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend's, Hamlet's Mill and to a lesser extent by the archaeoastronomical work of Gerald Hawkins and Alexander Thom.
Neugebauer as Mentor
To the extent Stahlman was investigating myths, it would be something of a rebellion against Neugebauer, who was scathing in his dismissal of both myth and natural philosophy.
Criticisms of Stahlman's Ideas



In his classes Stahlman presented a diagram of precession like the one in his 1970 article. In his 1970 article Stahlman writes about it" "To first approximation (which is all that premodern man could or needed to know about it), precession was that motion described by the axis of a spinning top...." Looking at his description, after many years, I now find it historically naive. The notion that "premodern man" would view the Earth as a top implies a kind of physical conceptualization that is found nowhere in the ethnographic (or early written) record.
The sequential change of the equinoctial or solstitial constellations is clearly an observable phenomenon; the conceptualization of this phenomenon as the wobbling of the axis of a spinning top seems anachronistic, drawing as it does on concepts of modern physics.
Manuscript Progress
It is doubtful whether the manuscript/book was ever entirely finish. If deemed completed it is doubtful whether it was in a form that was publishable.
Stahlman had a serious alcohol addiction problem which greatly interfered with his academic productivity.
Archival Material
UW Archives and Record Management have materials on William Stahlman and David Lindberg. Found during an initial search: [1] Biographical files on both Stahlman and Lindberg [2] David C. Lindberg Papers, 1976-2011 [3] An Oral History Program Interview with David Lindberg (2003)". The number of archive boxes or foot-length of documents was not indicated. [Note: A look inside the David Lindberg papers might be productive.]
There were some Stahlman and Coleman materials still left in a storage room in, and
At least one person at UW inherited a few odd items from Stahlman (that included bound photocopies of the first two volumes of Delambre's, Histoire de l'astronomie ancienne [1817] and a blue binder with a handful of sparse notes on the Almagest (apparently for a seminar). The items were passed on by David Lindberg from Stahlman's library of books on ancient astronomy. [This identifies the library of books in Stahlman's office as being his personal collection.]
I am again reasonably sure that, if such a history of astronomy (still?) existed in Dave's files at the time, I would have been consulted about it, in person or by email (... Dave passed on to me from his library a few of Stahlman's books on ancient astronomy)."
Miscellaneous Remarks
Part 1:
Stahlman's research was unknown [undisclosed] to most of his graduate students [MIT]. It is certain that at least one of Stahlman's former students was aware of the manuscript [at the time] but doubted the book was ever finished, and if it was finished doubted it was in a publishable form.
There was a belief among the graduate students that Stahlman had become a perfectionist because of his mentor Otto Neugebauer.
It's interesting that Stahlman mentions Otto Reuter, author of Germanische Himmelskunde. At Oxford 1 in 1981 Olaf Pedersen had some negative comments about Reuter's work: "a vast, but uncritical and unmethodical compilation."
Stahlman's interpretation of the Greeks was a bit strange and didn't match what was taught in the philosophy courses. [It would be interesting to know how Stahlman deviated from scholarly consensus on the ancient Greeks and science.]
A lot is now only remembered vaguely. Class notes possessed from the period were disposed of circa 2003 during downsizing.
Stahlman's PhD dissertation likely had the mathematical touch of a Neugebauer student.
David Lindberg was disappointed when he realized he couldn't do scholarship any more, but was really disappointed when he couldn't remember what to do next in a woodworking project (he did fine hardwood cabinetry as a hobby).
Stahlman had three dissertation students who might once have been contacted, but two of these have already passed away and the third finished his degree too early to have known anything about Stahlman's publication plans in the 1970s.
Since 1988 the Department relocated twice and disposed of much as a consequence of the relocations. Now it no longer even exists, its faculty has been merged into History.
Part 2:
Voils recalls the submission, he had written after taking a class in the history of Babylonian mathematics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, was rejected on some technical ground. (It is now uncertain whether any copy survives.) Voils changed interests into computer science at about the same time. The history of Babylonian mathematics class was taught by William Stahlman. (1923-1975) Stahlman had taken his doctorate at Brown University under Otto Neugebauer.
Provisional conclusion
My conclusion is the one-time existence of the manuscript cannot be ruled out. If it did exist, what became of it is now unsolvable. Also, details of its content are unknowable. Mark Stahlman states that when at MIT, William Stahlman was a member of Giorgio de Santillana's "project group" contributing towards Hamlet's Mill. However, it is difficult to accept Mark Stahlman's claim that William Stahlman was the primary resource for Hamlet's Mill. According to Mark Stahlman his father related that Giorgio de Santillana relied heavily on his [somewhat ambiguous but obviously meaning William Stahlman's] collection of ancient manuscripts in the preparation of Hamlet's Mill. Again, it is a somewhat puzzling statement. The culmination of multi-contributor efforts that became Hamlet's Mill was combined in the 'train wreck' that comprised the 1966 seminar notes. The source/basis of Hamlet's Mill was the Spring 1966 seminar notes marked, "21.93 T Autumn, 1966, Introduction to Ancient Cosmology." This poorly written document was prepared by von Dechend (who made no attempt to correct it and retype it). (I need to check this document again for any reference to Stahlman's name.) But we can see a reason for William Stahlman to have begun to accumulate a collection of notes on mythology and astronomy. After his move to UW-Madison, details of continued cooperation with de Santillana are perhaps contained in archival material. Also some time after his move to UW-Madison, by the 1970s at least, some people believed he was not as committed to his scholarly studies as he



had once been. Health and personal issues seem to have played a role. It was indicated that he was addicted to alcohol. Also, he applied for a disability parking permit. Progress with his manuscript had perhaps stalled. Perhaps his alcohol dependence and resulting illness resulted in a cessation of the project. If any manuscript went to the care of David Lindberg it remained unactioned and when David Lindberg began to suffer with Alzheimer's disease any material by William Stahlman that was in his care may have eventually become lost.
The reason for the considerable interest in William Stahman is Hamlet’s Mill was a muddled book salvaged from von Dechend's 'train wreck' 1966 seminar notes whereas Stahlman was independently and progressively working on the same/similar themes in an expansive and orderly and clear manner.
Linda Schele and Maya mythology as astronomical language
Linda Schele (no date).
Linda Schele (October 30, 1942 – April 18, 1998) was an expert in the field of Maya epigraphy and iconography. She was a major figure in the decipherment of Maya hieroglyphic writing and the study of ancient Maya civilization. At her death, she was John D. Murchison Regents Professor of Art at the University of Texas. (She was also Jack G. Taylor Regents Professor in Fine Arts.) She played an invaluable role in the decipherment of much of the Maya hieroglyphs. Her doctoral dissertation, "Maya Glyphs: the Verbs" was published in 1982 and won "The Most Creative and Innovative Project in Professional and Scholarly Publication" an award given by the Professional and Scholarly Publishing Division of the Association of American Publishers. The Blood of Kings was awarded the Alfred H. Barr Jr. Award of the College Art Association for the best exhibition catalogue of 1986. She was awarded diplomas of recognition (Museo Popol Vuh and the Universidad Francisco Marroquin) by the government of Guatemala in March 1998. Linda Schele began taking commercial art courses at the University of Cincinnati in 1960 and graduated in Education and Art in 1964. With an increasing interest in literature, she spent another 4 years in Cincinnati's graduate program and obtained her master's degree in Art in 1968. In 1968 she started teaching Studio Art at the University of South Alabama, remaining there till 1980, by which time she was Professor. Originally an artist and teacher, she first visited Mexico in 1970 to photograph Mesoamerican monuments in Yucatán on behalf of the University. This first encounter with Maya art and writing shaped her future career. She was initially attracted to the complex designs of the hieroglyphs but quickly became drawn to the intellectual challenge of the decipherment. After an obligatory visit to Palenque the next summer she became fascinated by the art and decided to investigate the culture and history of the ancient people who had created the city. In her early Maya studies she was mentored by Dr Merle Greene Robertson (1913-2011) an American artist, art historian, archaeologist, lecturer and Mayanist researcher. Within 3 years Linda Schele had transformed herself into a Maya epigrapher at the forefront of the field. Her groundbreaking interpretation of Mayan hieroglyphics enabled archeologists to read about 85 per cent of the extensive records left by Maya society. In 1981, she took up an associate professorship in art (from 1987 a full position) at the University of Texas at Austin.

Cover page of Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman's Path by David Freidel, Linda Schele, and Joy Parker.(1993). David Freidel is an anthropologist/archaeologist (Washington University in St. Louis). At the time of the book's publication he was teaching at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Linda Schele was a linguist and art historian. Joy Parker of San Clemente is a popular writer (and also a classically trained singer). The book is a blend of archaeology, anthropology, and astronomy. Maya Cosmos, sets out how Schele became convinced that the many cosmological symbols in Maya art can be "woven together into a coherent, eminently logical pattern that is, in essence, a map of the sky."
Linda Schele proposed the interaction of astronomy and mythology in the ancient world, especially in the Americas. See: Freidel, David., Schele, Linda. and Parker, Joy. (1993).

Astronomy in Sumerian texts
There is no formal astronomy in Sumerian texts. Sumerian literary texts, however, contain astronomical references. (Some knowledge of Sumerian astronomy exists in literary texts and references to calendars.) The Sumerian term UDU.IDIM.MES (Akkadian bibbu) = wild sheep = planets. In the religious text Nanna-Suen Hymn 1 (Sumerian period, 3rd-millennium BCE), the mention of cows is an allusion to the stars in the night sky. (Nanna-Suen (Bronze Age Mesopotamian moon god) Hymn I (of 15 hymns to Nanna-Suen known) has a section on stars and cows. There is an allusion to stars and planets as cattle and the sky as a cattle pen. In a later text the sun and the moon are herdsmen who keep the sky ordered. There is no evidence that the Sumerians were familiar with domes. For the Sumerians the sky is like the curved roof of a cattle pen.) In the religious text the Exaltation of Istar (Middle Babylonian period, circa 1150-1000 BCE), the sun and moon are herdsmen keeping the stars (as cattle) in their order. There is no suggestion of myth as a technical language for astronomy.
Bendt Alster
Two important essays: (1) Alster, Bendt. (1976). "Early Patterns in Mesopotamian Literature." In: Eichler, Barry. (Editor). Kramer Anniversary Volume, Pages 13-24). (The Danish author, a leading Assyriologist, gives an astronomical interpretation of the subject matter. Bendt Alster believed (at least at time of publication) astronomical observations could be discerned in Sumerian compositions that date as early as the middle of the 3rd-millennium BCE which refer to the movement of the heavenly bodies and the constellations.) (2) Alster, Bendt. (1974). "On the Interpretation of the Sumerian Myth "Inanna and Enki."" (Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und Vorderasiatische Archäologie, Volume 64, I Halband, March, Pages 20-34). (The Danish author, a leading Assyriologist (died 2012), gives an astronomical interpretation of the subject matter. He seems to have been influenced by Hamlet's Mill by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend (1969).
Also: Aslter, Bendt. (1972). "Ninurta and the Turtle." (Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Volume 24, Number 4, Pages 120-125). Alster, Bendt. (1974). "The Paradigmatic Character of Mesopotamian Heroes." (Revue d'Assyriologie et d'Archéologie Orientale, Volume LXVIII, Number 1, Pages 49-60).
Bendt Alster believed that Mesopotamian myths were related to chronology; history was viewed as an eternal succession of cyclic periods, repeating the same patterns. According to Bendt Alster, inherent in structure of Sumerian mythology was the establishment of cyclic time (in which human lives become shorter). History was an eternal return to the same patterns - the (annual (and longer?)) return of the celestial bodies. Perhaps the clearest and most detailed of his essays is explaining an astronomical interpretation of Sumerian mythology is: Alster, Bendt. (1976).



"Early Patterns in Mesopotamian Literature." In: Eichler, Barry. (Editor). Kramer Anniversary Volume, Pages 13-24). The author later doubted some of his ideas - he believed his thesis could not withstand criticism - and did not proceed with his proposed book, The Eternal Cycle giving an astronomical interpretation of Sumerian mythology. (He literally tore up the manuscript.) In his 1976 essay, "Early Patterns in Mesopotamian Literature" it was described as "Now in press." It was perhaps some 200 pages in length. His manuscript argued that the cyclical return of the planets, (and the sun and moon) played an important role in Mesopotamian religion. One source mistakenly gives: Alster, Bendt. (1975). "On the Interpretation of the Myth 'Inanna and Enki." (Zeitschrift für Assyriologie, Band 4, Pages 20-34). Bendt Alster was Professor of Sumeriology in the Institut for Tværkulturelle og Regionale Studier (ToRS), Det Humanistiske Fakultet, Københavns Universitet, Copenhagen, Denmark.) Alster, Bendt. (1974). "The Paradigmatic Character of Mesopotamian Heroes." (Revue d'Assyriologie et d'Archéologie Orientale, Volume LXVIII, Number 1, Pages 49-60). (The author favours an astronomical interpretation of the subject matter.)
Modern claim for Egyptian knowledge of precession
Source: "The Consciousness of Time and the Conquest of Space: The Dawn of Civilization, Anthropology, and Archaeoastronomy." by Lucia Gregori and Giovanni Gregoria (Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, Volume 879, Issue1, 1999, Pages 158-163; Pages 159-160). [Tempos in Science and Nature: Structures, Relations, and Complexity.]
Vlora and Tucci (1997). It is difficult to find any information for the seldom mentioned 1997 article by Vlora and Tucci. Both are identifiable as Italian academics. Vlora = Nedim Vlora, Universita degli Studi di Bari. Tucci = Giuseppe? Tucci (Egyptologist?) (not Pasquale? or Giulia Tucci). (Nedim Vlora, 1997: Dipartimento di Scienze Storiche e Geografiche dell'Università di Bari. At time of publishing "All'alba del Giorno Precessione e Moti Propri." with Raffaele Falagario (2002, Pages 27-32): Dipartimento di Bioetica; Sezione di Cosmologia, Geografia, Archeoastronomia; Università delgi Studi di Bari.

Comm. on History of IAGA). The only short description I can presently put together is: They carried out a detailed reading and (clever) interpretation of several symbols appearing in paintings within some Egyptian tombs. They claim that precession was known to Egyptian priests. They claim that they have decoded several symbols appearing in Egyptian tombs that demonstrate real measurement of equinox precession (or at least be interpreted in terms of an apparent knowledge of precession/possible indirect evidence about the knowledge of equinox precession) by ancient Egyptians.
Excursus: MIT, School of Humanities
Even in the late 1940s, MIT did not stress the humanities. The emphasis was on a myriad of science courses. It is indicated that all new students took the introductory courses in physics and calculus. However, this period at MIT was also a time of the beginning curriculum change. An architect was appointed as Dean of Humanities and he started a course - required of all undergraduates - that was taught by the Giorgio de Santillana. It is recalled by a past student that de Santillana made a valiant effort with the course content. "MIT at that time [circa end of 1940s] didn't stress the humanities; there wasn't time with all the science courses. The Institute was just beginning to change this situation. They appointed an architect as Dean of Humanities and started a course required of all undergraduates taught by a historian named Georgio de Santillana. I can't recall the reading assignments now, but he made a valiant effort to convert all of us into regular people." ("Wondering About Things." by George Field (Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Volume 52, 2014, Pages 1-42, Page 3).)
MIT School of Humanities, Arts & Social Sciences (http://shass.mit.edu/inside/history): "Pioneering MIT pioneered among the science and technical schools in offering a rigorous liberal arts education. The School's focus on critical thinking, communication and leadership skills, cultural perspective and international education are central to the Institute's mission of knowledge, innovation, and service. 1930s Elevating the Humanities and Social Sciences at MIT During the administration of President Karl Taylor Compton (1930-1949) work was done to improve the status of humanities and social sciences at MIT. On 9 March 1932 the MIT Corporation adopted a new plan of administration, creating three schools (Engineering, Science, and Architecture) and two divisions including the Division of Humanities. The Division of Humanities differed from the schools in that it offered no programs leading to degrees. Aside from academic instruction in the fields of English, history, economics, and language, the division was also "responsible for instruction in such fields as sociology, labor relations, government, international relations, law, philosophy, psychology, literature, music, and fine arts for both undergraduate and graduate students." The Department of Economics and Statistics, the Department of English and History, and the Department of Modern Languages were brought into the Division of Humanities in 1932. .... 1940s Four-year Program in the Humanities Created In 1944, a four-year program of required courses in the humanities and social sciences for undergraduates was adopted by the faculty. The Committee on Educational Survey, also known as the Lewis Committee, whose report was published in 1949, called for the establishment of a School of Humanities which could grant degrees. .... 1950s School of Humanities and Social Studies Formed The School of Humanities and Social Studies was established in December 1950 with John Ely Burchard as the first dean. The Center for International Studies was founded and placed within the School in [1950] as an extra-departmental organization. The psychology and political science sections were established in the Department of Economics and Social Science in 1951 and 1956 respectively. In 1954, a Department of Humanities was created within the school. The new department incorporated the Department of English and History and other areas of related academic interest. In 1955, Course XXI was begun so that students could major in humanities or social sciences in combination with science or engineering. The students received the degree of bachelor of science without specification of a science or engineering department. A graduate program in political science was introduced in 1958, and in 1959 the name of the school was changed to School of Humanities and Social Science (SHSS). .... 1960s New Sections and Departments Created The early 1960s saw the establishment of history (1960), philosophy (1961), music (1961), and literature (1962) sections within the Department of Humanities. Graduate programs in psychology (1960), linguistics (1961), and philosophy (1963) were developed in addition to the well-established graduate program in economics. .... 1970s Revisions to the Core Curriculum In 1971 the Commission on MIT Education began reevaluation of both the general structure and the specific content of the General Institute Requirements in the humanities and social sciences. In October 1971, Dean Bishop appointed a subcommittee of the School Council to examine various plans for revision of the core curriculum in humanities and social science. Dean Harold John Hanham was appointed in 1973. During his tenure the SHSS stated its mission as comprising three elements: to provide highly developed graduate programs in economics, linguistics, philosophy, political science, and psychology; to enable students to satisfy MIT's humanities requirement (viewed by the SHSS as a general education requirement); and to maintain undergraduate subject majors in economics, philosophy, political science, humanities, and science and engineering. In 1973 the Technology Studies Program was developed to relate the humanities more directly to science and engineering. .... 2000s A New Name On 1 July 2000, the name of the school changed from the School of Humanities and Social Science to the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences to recognize more fully the breadth and contributions of the arts at the Institute. ...."
In one teaching program by the Department of Humanities the topic explored was the "Greek Achievement." Professor Giorgio de Santillana led sessions on Greek science and cosmology, Assistant Professor William Watson talked on the economic background, and Assistant Professor David Berlew of the Alfred P. Sloan School of Management discussed the subject from the perspectives of sociology and physiology.



John Blum (who taught for 9 years at MIT) relates that one year Giorgio de Santillana offered a seminar on great trials, beginning with Socrates, then proceeding on, to use de Santillana's own book on Galileo, and ending with Sacco and Vanzetti.
"The Committee on Educational Survey, also known as the Lewis Committee, whose report was published in 1949, called for the establishment of a School of Humanities which could grant degrees. The School of Humanities and Social Studies was established in December 1950 with John Ely Burchard as the first dean. The Center for International Studies was founded and placed within the School in [1950] as an extra-departmental organization. The psychology and political science sections were established in the Department of Economics and Social Science in 1951 and 1956 respectively. In 1954 a Department of Humanities was created within the school. The new department incorporated the Department of English and History and other areas of related academic interest. In 1955, Course XXI was begun so that students could major in humanities or social sciences in combination with science or engineering. The students received the degree of bachelor of science without specification of a science or engineering department. In 1959 the name of the school was changed to School of Humanities and Social Science (SHSS). Graduate programs in political science (1958), philosophy (1963), psychology (1960), and linguistics (1961) were developed in addition to the wellestablished graduate program in economics. The early 1960s saw the establishment of philosophy (1961), music (1961), history (1960), and literature (1962) sections within the Department of Humanities." (https://libraries.mit.edu/mithistory/research/schools-and-departments/school-ofhumanities-arts-and-social-sciences/)
"MIT's Course 21 (Humanities) was considered innovative when it was established in the 1950s, although its roots go back to the opening of the Institute in 1865. During the 1960s the School grew rapidly, was reorganized into most of its current departments and sections, and began to grant full-scale degrees. In the 1970s and 1980s, the School continued to define separate programs and rearrange sections. In 1990 the School replaced the generic SB degree in Humanities with SB degrees in specified areas of humanistic study: Anthropology, History, Literature, Foreign Languages and Literatures, Music, and Writing. To reflect the growth and incorporation of the arts at MIT, and in celebration of its 50th anniversary in 2000, the School changed its name to the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences."

Vito Francesco Polcaro (1945-2018) was a polymath, with 3 degrees in mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering and mathematics. His scientific research was primarily in high-energy astrophysics and technology, and in the astrophysics of stars with the greatest mass. He was very interested in cultural astronomy, archaeoastronomy and archaeology. Education: Degree in mechanic engineering, Rome U., 1968; Doctor of Philosophy in Aerospace Engineering, Rome U., 1971; degree in mathematics, Rome U., 1974. Career: Researcher Laboratory Space Flight Dynamics, National Research Council, Rome, 1971-1973; researcher Institute Atmospheric Physics, National Research Council, Rome, 19731976; researcher Institute Space Astrophysics, National Research Council, Frascati, Italy, 1976-1988; 1st researcher, National Research Council, Frascati, since 1988; professor, Rome U., 1990-1991.

Polcaro was sympathetic to Hamlet's Mill. Surprisingly, Polcaro wrote (page 33) that Hamlet's Mill "is a well written and intriguing book." Actually, the book is a mess - it lacks clarity.

Von Dechend's investigative method in the absence of secondary sources
Both de Santillana and von Dechend believed astronomical information was coded for ease of transmission (i.e., intended world-wide transmission) and to enable secrecy (i.e., confinement to intellectual elites).
Von Dechend's method for obtaining/decoding astronomical information in the absence of discussion of such in secondary sources attracted critics due to its lack of rigour in investigative technique. Von Dechend's method is explained by Abe Aronow in his 1962 thesis (Page 21): "After having thoroughly reviewed the cosmological traditions of earlier, contiguous and contemporary cultures, the text is read and evaluated, by enlightened conjecture for the most part and then later correlated with many other similar studies in ... [the] attempt to extract a pattern or connection between various different explorations." Abe Aronow continues (Pages 21-22): "It is obvious to me that in the course of such a study, much spurious information seems, for a time, to be important. However, such dangers can be mitigated by good scholarship in the correlative stages of the study." Also (Page 22): "Professor de Santillana has given the following analogy for this method: Most history comes to us as a container with its contents rotted and we must try to reconstruct the contents by comparing the containers. This study is a case in which the contents are extant but the containers have been rotted away. Only in comparing the various contents can we ascertain the character of their various or, maybe, not so various containers."
Von Dechend discusses her use of the methodology of comparison in "Einführung in die Archaische Kosmologie." (Pages 7-31. In: Einführung in die Archaische Kosmologie, Vorlesungen im Wintersemester 1976/77, Hertha von Dechend. (The publication is available from Differenz
Verlang\Franz Krojer, München.) Some plain and more detailed writings on the methodological approach would have been helpful. At times the tales are not even similar in a general sort of way but are believed to be different in form but similar in content.
Von Dechend's decoding method and rules
Not a lot is known about the history of these. However, it is evident from the content of Hamlet's Mill that the conclusions drawn are not based on any profound research. According to von Dechend's predecessor Eduard Stucken there were formal formulas of astral mythology. Mythology was converted into a formula for universal application. In the case of Israel this particularly constructed mythology was later demythologized and recast as Biblical historical figures. However, Stucken had intellectual connections with the star-myth school of Ernst Siecke in that he adopted the methods of the star-myth school.
The astral methods of Siecke's star-myth school are basically the methods of Stucken's Astralmythen (and most likely the basic methods of Hertha von Dechend). Nowhere in her writings is von Dechend critical of Eduard Stucken. In the first 3 parts of his Astralmythen, Stucken examined the



figure of a major personage from the Hebrew Bible against his astral interpretation of earlier Mesopotamian myth. (Stucken's Astralmythen depended heavily on Near Eastern materials.) His method was to parse (separate into component parts) the Mesopotamian stories into motifs and then cite biblical passages that corresponded to them, often letting the 'parallel' excerpts speak for themselves. Particularly in the last 2 parts of Astralmythen, Stucken 'connected' the biblical narrative to star lore through a wide-ranging tour of world mythologies. By the completion of Astralmythen (Part 5 being published 10 years later that Part 1), Mesopotamian origins no longer seemed to be the focus. Stucken made no reference to the planets. (Note: Motif = a unit (detail) of content (a narrative plot, a sequence of several events, or a single event or action). Traits, within a cultural context, are human activities. The meaning of traits differs amongst different cultures. It is demonstrated that isolated motifs can travel quite easily across space and time.)
Note: Discussing myths as abstractions detached from the cultural and political systems in which they develop (or are adopted and adapted) enables structural and narrative analysis.
Stucken made random comparisons from mythologies all over the world. This 'method' was followed in Hamlet's Mill. Also followed was uncritical acceptance of coincidences of detail, incidental similarities, and general resemblances. All are useless as convincing evidence. Also useless is assertion replacing proof.
We may add to von Dechend's investigative method the method and rules von Dechend decided to apply. The rules von Dechend decided to apply: (1) animals are stars, (2) gods are planets, and (3) topographic references are metaphors for locations - usually of the sun - on the celestial sphere. The 'rule' that animals = stars was proposed by Leo Frobenius (Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes (1904)) when attempting to establish foundations for further research.
The few rules are not established in any manner to demonstrate they are a means to separate superficial similarities and presumptions of direct connections from any possible genuine affiliations.
Frobenius formulated "laws" for interpreting mythology. See: Die Weltanschauung der Naturvölker (1898). See also the critical (Englishlanguage) book review by Franz Boas in American Anthropologist, New Series, Volume 1, Number 4, October, 1899, Pages 775-777.
Von Dechend's premise that real myths grew out of "measures and counting" enabled selective use of material i.e., what conformed to expectation of precessional coding. (Note: The archaic importance of measures and numbers should not be underestimated. "We are, then, confronting here an extremely widespread practice, and this virtual universality entitles us to see in it a deep-rooted trait of the primitive mentality. To measure is to isolate a certain quantitative feature of the object measured - whatever its quality. But to the primitive mind, measure is something derived from the quality of the object or, at least, intimately connected with that quality - hence the need for a different measure for virtually every separate object, with none of the measures reducible to the others." (Measures and Men by Witold Kula (1986, Page 89).)
Regarding von Dechend's investigative method: In an article on Panbabylonism in The American Journal of Theology, Volume 12, 1908, it is explained that Stucken applied the 'astral' test to the myths of various people. Regarding von Dechend's premise that real myths grew out of "measures and counting": Hugo Winckler's version of Panbabylonism gave importance to its 'number theory,' which was passed down in the Pythagorean number theory. The Panbabylonist Hugo Winckler found ultimate significance in an abstract mathematical scheme. Distinctive in Winckler's particular version of Panbabylonism was the emphasis/importance he gave to its "number theory." He claimed that this has come down to us in the Pythagorean teaching, which he further claimed was simply a product of the ancient Near East.
Franz Krojer writes that von Dechend stated in conversation that in a lecture text ("Introduction to Archaic Cosmology") for the 1976/1977 winter semester [at MIT], she stated she set out the "rules" for the astronomical interpretation of mythology. Amazingly, she seems never to have made them available them elsewhere. The "rules" given in the stated publication are quite few and quite basic.
Attempts to infer the meaning of ancient myths has to deal with the problem of corruption of content. In many cases there is a single version extant (and so does not enable comparison with other versions). This makes the ‘time depth’ of meaning inferred open to debate. Added to these considerations are issues of shared ancestry, or cultural transmission, and those due to parallel invention. Also, myths change over time, are abandoned, or invented anew. Examples: (1) The rapid inclusion of horses in the mythologies of the Plains Indians after European contact, (2) The rapid development of Melanesian cargo cults after European contact (especially WWII), (3) the invention by Mormons in the 1820s and 1830s of an entire mythology for New World Indians.
In, When They Severed Earth from Sky (2005) the Barbers offer scores of what they concoct as "myth principles." Not explained is why would ancient people transform observations into complex stories.
For von Dechend, and for others, ancient, classical, and medieval mythology has been a Rorschach test into which they can project nearly any notion that appeals to them. The contents of the myths tell a different story to every person who interprets them. The resemblances between the myths and identification of a parallel astronomical content originates with the imagination. What is required is a more robust form of evidence and especially theories that can be tested. It is all too easy to make unverifiable assertions about mythology.
Von Dechend's model for 'discovering' connected similarities is ultimately a crude attempt to marshall at times very complex material. Meticulous collating to reveal the extent of parallelisms is absent. This hardly allows for nuanced comparison. Many claimed parallels can only be described as "rough parallels." Claimed matches/parallels are often tenuous. Any discrepancies are not delved into. With many examples the differences outnumber the resemblances. The book overall is little more than series of vignettes which illustrate the intuitions of the main author (von Dechend) but fail in proving them to have a connected point. The claimed similarities are too elementary for a book that makes very sweeping claims. Also, there is not much that is evidently in common until von Dechend forces an interpretation.

Eduard Stucken
The astronomical method of interpretation of mythology applied by Eduard Stucken (and later adopted by the key Panbabylonists) was simply the restricted application/extension of the nature method of interpretation of mythology applied by such persons as Wilhelm Schwartz (Friedrich Leberecht Wilhelm Schwartz, 1821-1899). There was actually, however, limited astral interpretation within Stucken's Astralmythen. Suzanne Marchand (Down from Olympus (2003)) has described Stucken's Astralmythen as "bizarre." Also, the book was written in an iconoclastic manner. According to Stucken, Abraham is originally the constellation Orion, and Sarah is the star Sirius. Also, Abraham and Sarah are parallel figures to Osiris and Isis in Egyptian mythology. According to Stucken the accounts of Abraham go back to 2 Babylonian sources, the legend of Etana and



Istar's Journey to the Underworld. Not a lot is known about what the Panababylonists believed about supposed coding methods and rules. According to Hertha von Dechend's predecessor Eduard Stucken there were formal formulas of astral mythology. In an article on Panbabylonism in The American Journal of Theology, Volume 12, 1908, it is explained that Stucken applied the 'astral' test to the myths of various people. It was believed by Stucken that mythology was converted into a formula for universal application. In the case of Israel this particularly constructed mythology was later demythologized and recast as Biblical historical figures. Note: A lot of Stucken's 5 volumes had nothing to do with astral myths.
Eduard Stucken was a nephew of the anthropologist Adolf Bastian. Stucken completed a course in astronomy in Hamburg then went with Robert Koldewey's 1890-1891 German Oriental Society expedition to the Hittite site Sendschirli in northern Syria. On his return to Berlin Stucken studied multiple ancient languages but does not seem to have acquired sufficient knowledge of any. He was not - as some persons believed - a linguist. The first volume of his Astralmythen was published in 1896 and was crammed with philological detail. In it he argued that the origin of all myths (especially Old Testament stories) and art was Assyrian astral sciences. (Like the author's of Hamlet's Mill (1969) he sought to explain all the mythologies of the world on the basis of supposed astral-lore encrypted in Mesopotamian myths.) The volume was written as his doctoral dissertation but it was rejected. Stucken simply proceeded with additional volumes. In his second volume of Astralmythen published in 1899 he rejected Adolf Bastian's ideas of independent cultural evolution and universal "elementary forms of thinking." (The polymath and pioneering ethnologist/anthropologist Adolf Bastian was Stucken's uncle.) Instead, Stucken argued for the diffusion of all myths from an ur-Babylonian form. After all 5 volumes of his Astralmythen were published (1896-1907) Stucken focussed on writing plays and novels. The Panbabylonists considered Stucken to be a dilettante. Stucken's ideas of astral myths were adopted by the Panbabylonists but usually Stucken's Astralmythen was not cited directly.
Some rules given by von Dechend to seminar students
In Introduction to Ancient Cosmology (1966; Pages I-VI):
"Now you know from the Decalogue, that commandments are most of the times interdictions, and so you'll not be astonished to meet several stern "Thou-shalt-not-commit's." (sic) They are meant to guide your attention, since your thoughts are, necessarily, so dyed in the wool that you are not even aware of the fact that you have to do with mere suppositions, and not with plain common sense and with very many "obviousnesses". (sic)"
"#1. "Thou shalt not" assume that the founders of high civilization have been of inferior intelligence to you."
"#2. Do not underestimate scientific feats of the first rank and order." "[Do] ... not overestimate the scientific curiosity of the homo normalis, or ... underestimate scientific master feats of our earliest ancestors."
"#3. Take your language seriously: unprecise (sic) language discloses the lack of precision of thought ...."
"#4. "... Forthcoming scientists as you are, you know very well that you cannot "tell" physical, chemical, etc. phenomena but in technical language, by means of formulae, i.e. of a (sic) elaborate and specific terminology. This is no modern occupation ...."
"#5. "Our current conception of poetry is unapplicable (sic) to former times. Particularly the notion that the poet invents his plots out of thin air and is, moreover, completely free in the choice of representing them."
(Page 5.)
"#6. "Thou shalt not commit Euhemerism: ...." "And "Euhemerism" stands for every sort of interpreting myth as reporting 'history' in the broadest sense ...."
Regarding "#2. Von Dechend further explains (Page III) "And do not overestimate, by all means, the scientific curiosity of the average pedestrian called homo sapiens - of all times, in all continents: the inventive sub-species which we like to call 'Homo Scientificus' is an extremely rare one.

Possible arguments by MIT critics during the 1960s against von Dechend's method
Every claim that forms a part of Hamlet's Mill has to meet rigorous standards of critical/scientific scrutiny. The claims that made up the book were being openly formed at MIT in the 1960s (during the course of a variety of activities). This pre-publication phase saw critical opposition to the themes and arguments that later comprised the book. The methods, ideas, and claims of Hamlet's Mill were already under scrutiny of other MIT academics and subject to critique. The nature of the arguments put by MIT critics at the time regarding von Dechend's lack of methodological rigour are now unfortunately lost and likely not recoverable (forgotten with the passage of time). Likely they focused on her subjective methods and 'tortured' analysis of myths.
It is possible the MIT critics of von Dechend's methodology expressed their views along the following lines: The key criticisms were likely the approach to myth adopted by von Dechend and de Santillana is methodologically uncritical. The comparisons made are ad hoc i.e., done with a particular purpose in mind. Is mythology a technical language that codes astronomical knowledge (precession) through allegory? A systematic presentation of the analytic methodology that enables its analysis and the evaluation of its validity is not provided. A world-wide dispersal of a primary myth that was originated to preserve and transmit a disguised esoteric astronomical knowledge (precession) has not been demonstrated. Is myth really an effective means for the transmission of astronomical information relating to precession? Do we possess the tools to enable the informed assessment of the uncertainty in the interpretation involving encoded astronomical information? Building on this, another likely criticism would be von Dechend's ideas of oral memory/oral transmission and her concept of astronomical data being coded (using pre-fabricated elements for phrases) – at least by the Neolithic period – by a particular technique of oral verse-making for trans-global transmission, by means of an oral epic comprising a mono-myth that remained unchanged across the globe and across millennia and reached early modern times; with a key example being the Kalevala. What preconditions made such a particular cultural exchange a possibility? A better explanation than exchanges between "scientific elites" is required.
It is not shown that the (supposed) mono-myth, full of diverse information, always travelled from one culture to another without being transformed/changed by the receiving culture into forms compatible with its own modes of thought. There is no suggestion that the receiving



culture always obtained the mono-myth directly from the original Near East source and not through an intermediary culture or chain of intermediary cultures.
There is no attempt to define with any rigour the manner (way) in which transmission was enabled. An early world of constant mutual contact and exchange is perhaps a Western bias. The label ancient "Near East" masks under a single general term a diverse number of cultures. Also, to imply that early cultures produced no mythology of their own until the monomyth was introduced is an assumption lacking in proof.
It is impossible to define the time of borrowing in tales remembered orally.
A key criticism is - and may well have been at MIT - lack of methodological sophistication regarding proposed parallels. Hamlet's Mill aside, the values of parallels remains difficult to decide. An overreliance on broad thematic similarities. Merely comparing a series of stories rather than scrutinizing individual stories on their own merits ignores a fundamental principle of comparative mythology. Also, the limits of comparative mythology are not discussed. Resemblances are not confirmation. It is not scientific to group together a conglomerate of resemblances from all over the world - and from different time periods - and then argue this is proof of worldwide diffusion. A resemblance is good for the purposes of illustration, but it is not confirmation.
Not discussed by de Santillana and von Dechend are those items of myth and ancient astronomical lore that cannot be fitted by any means within their precessional scheme.
Note: The comparative method of the Panbabylonists/Hamlet's Mill is fraught with peril. It fails to achieve its goal. The question of methodology in making comparisons has not been dealt with. Similarity is not a conclusive argument/conclusive proof of identical correspondences. Cultural meaning is never introduced - a blanket astronomical explanation is given. Understanding whether there are more differences than similarities is important. However, in Hamlet's Mill, explaining differences and their distribution is neglected in favour of chasing similarities. For von Dechend, comparisons are intended to imply direct cultural contacts or borrowings/transmissions, not simply patterns of thought. The justification of this is the belief in the diffusion of the monomyth. An explanation for this approach is demanded. The comparative method is still valid as a research method. The criteria for whether there is an underlying scientific basic is not based on claimed results but on the way information is sought, organised, and argued. Careful criticism of sources needs to be included.
Problems with the use of 19th-century materials as a basis for Hamlet's Mill
The authors of Hamlet's Mill chose to use 19th-century materials and studies of mythology over modern approaches. The reason being these antiquated studies favoured their approach and interpretations. The result was that that Hamlet's Mill is a naive interpretation of mythology. The key problems with this methodology is summarised below by Daniel Ogden.
"In the early part of the last century classicists pointed to the existence of a number of parallels between Aegean mythologies and those found in biblical, Egyptian, and Mesopotamian texts (Brown 1898; Frazer 1921), but often these comparisons lacked methodological sophistication and relied too heavily upon broad thematic similarities. More recent studies demonstrate a greater awareness of the limits of the comparative method, but also a greater appreciation for what shared mythological elements imply (or do not imply) about intercultural contact and the diffusion of ideas (Burkert 1987b; Graf2004a; N. Marinatos 2001; Mondi 1990; Penglase 1994; West 1995, 1997).. The works of Hesiod and Homer, in particular, have been brought into close dialogue with the great epics of Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Syro-Canaan, and, less often, Egypt (Bachvarova 2002, 2005; Langdon 1990; N. Marinatos 2001; Noegel 2002, 2005a). It is now appropriate to speak of an "Asiatic mythological koine" and its formative impact on the Aegean literatures of the Bronze and Iron Ages (Graf 2004a; cf. "Aegean koine" in Burkert 1985, 1992, but "Near Eastern-Aegean cultural community koiner" in Burkert 2005a:291). Such a koine, scholars suggest, explains the parallels that exist between Aegean and Near Eastern mythological conceptions concerning creation, cosmology, the gods, humankind, death, and the afterlife (Astour 1998; West 1995). In some cases, the mythological parallels are so geographically and temporally widespread that any effort to trace their westward movement with precision is impossible. Such is the case with the story of the world deluge. It is attested in a number of Sumerian, Akkadian, Greek, and Indian sources, and of course in the biblical story of Noah (Genesis 6-9)." ("Greek Religion and the Ancient Near East." by Scott Noegel. First published in: Daniel Ogden, Editor. The Blackwell Companion to Greek Religion (2006), Pages 21-37; Page 24.)
Neglected establishment of principles for comparative studies
One source has described von Dechend as a specialist in comparative mythology. This is not quite the same as being described as an expert.
Is the comparative enterprise justified by similar features in story structure? It is certainly legitimate to look for parallels. However, there needs to be a systematic method in the approach to the comparative method. Simply because many mythic themes are comparable does not necessarily mean that they are compatible in that they necessarily indicate diffusion/cultural contact. It is recognised that researchers are not always properly trained or well suited to do comparative studies. Commonly there has been a 'inventorial' approach to comparisons, listing various parallel themes without a suitable discussion of whether there is significance or not. Adequate articulation is required. Hamlet's Mill has problems on this point.
Von Dechend argued for a common pattern of thought in mythology. Like the Panbabylonists she overstressed "parallels" and similarities. She had little more than a 'detective' approach to literary/cultural comparison. Like the Panbabylonists she made far-fetched interpretations and combinations. It is a mistake to equate "parallelism" with "proof," to substitute the citation of parallels for reasoned argument. Direct borrowing is not necessarily indicated by "parallels" and similarities. A few similarities between 2 narratives doesn't mean that one is a copy of the other or that both have a common origin (ancestor). But where numerous similarities are present then perhaps we have some evidence of interdependence.
The comparative method remains full of uncertainties. Parallels and differences should be noted. Von Dechend does not engage in a discussion of parallels and differences. Sigmund Mowinckel (The Psalms in Israel’s Worship (1962, 2 Volumes, Page 241)) warned against the movement towards a "pan-patternism" (parallelism) as one sided and unreal as Panbabylonism. However, it has been pointed out that that whilst similarity of one or two details does not prove historical dependence, clusters of similarities are something quite different. It is argued that such clusters frequently, are not simply accidental or fortuitous, especially in contiguous civilisations. (See: Christianity, Judaism and other Greco-Roman cults: Studies for Morton Smith at 60. edited by Jacob Neusner (1975, Page 9).)
Johannes Haubold (Lecturer in Greek Literature at the University of Durham) states: "[M]eaningful comparative study is precisely not a matter of micro-level coincidences, however plausible or important they might seem."
Similarity does not mean that borrowing has taken place. Neither does similarity indicate the direction in which borrowing has occurred (if at all).



According to J. H. Walton there are 10 important principles that must be kept in mind when doing comparative studies. Application of these principles is not evident in Hamlet's Mill.
Source: Ouro, Roberto. (2011). "Similarities and Differences between the Old Testament and the Ancient Near East Texts." (Andrews University Seminary Studies, Volume 49, Number 1, Pages 5-32).
"Carolina López-Ruiz's chapter explores the comparative approach of looking at the relation of Greek mythology to traditions in the Near East. The beginning of her chapter reviews previous scholarship and the issues that have characterized the difficulty in reconciling Greek and Near Eastern parallels. Recent scholarship shows how "comparison no doubt holds the key to many unopened doors" (159) and how the state of this field "tantalizes us with the possibility of an apparently inexhaustible line of research" (154). A section on "Methodological Considerations" offers nine pitfalls that scholars should avoid in a comparative perspective. These range, for example, from warnings to avoid thinking of the "Near East" as a monolithic cultural entity to suggestions that we use terms like "adaptation," "appropriation," and "cultural transactions" rather than "simple borrowing" to describe such exchange between cultures (159-60). A final section offers an overview of genres, themes, and mythical figures that find parallels between the Greek and Near Eastern worlds, including discussions of Zeus and Aphrodite, connections between Homer’s poems and the Epic of Gilgamesh, and relation between Greek cosmogony and the Hurro-Hittite Song of Release. López-Ruiz's suggestion that we can speak of a "mythological koine" or "international mythological language" from the Late Bronze Age [1570-1200 BCE] and later is sound and supports the approach of seeing Greek culture as part of, rather than separate from, the cultures of the Near East. This important chapter should become standard reading for anyone looking for a brief but sophisticated overview on this subject."

Interpreting mythology
In Hamlet's Mill, mythic themes are traced with confidence and conviction, regardless of the vagueness and obscurity of the material. Hamlet’s Mill is an exercise in "Old School" diffusionism = Wherever a story which consists of the same combination of several elements is found in 2 regions (geographic locations), it must be concluded that its occurrence in both is due to diffusion.
There has never been agreement on how mythology should be handled. For a recent approach see: Audley-Miller, Lucy and Beate Dignas. (Editors). (2018). Wandering Myths: Transcultural Uses of Myth in the Ancient World.
There have been numerous scholarly attempts to analyse myths and identify an origin for them. Myths and legends are intended to convey information (or at least a point of view). The origin(s) of myth/folklore theme are unknown and most likely indeterminable. In a seminar in the early 1960s de Santillana and von Dechend stated their argument is developed from a re-examination of the findings of Nineteenth Century scholars. Interesting, many 19th-century scholars attempted to establish the original or Ur-form of a myth/legend/folk-tale. (Note: They are not the only authors to claim the findings of 19th-century authors are more reliable than modern scholarship. See the same type of argument from the pseudo-scholar Acharyas S (Dorothy Murdock, 1960(incorrectly 1961)-2015) in her totally unreliable book Suns of God (2004, Page 9). The book almost wholly consists of material uncritically taken from 19th-century supporters of the Jesus-Myth theory, many of whom were not scholars. Acharyas S writes: "Furthermore, the so-called outdated scholarship on the origins of religion in general, and Christianity in particular, that arose in the past few centuries is actually superior not only in depth but but also in perspective to what is often produced today." Having one of the largest private collections of 19th-century freethought literature and having spent some 20 years immersed in it I can only say that if she believed this then it is obvious to me that Acharyas S comes across as being totally ignorant of scholarly issues. Her self-published books are examples of weird pseudo-scholarship. (Almost all 19th-century freethought material is useless for present-day purposes.) Her advocacy of "astrotheology" has attracted a cultish group of followers who propagate her views as absolute historical truth. Her so-called astrotheology is based on promoting 19thcentury nature myths. An important factor in her astrotheology was precession. Since 1995 until her death from cancer in 2015 Dorothy Murdock made use of the internet to the extent that she was described by Wikipedia as an "American internet personality." A previous note I made on one of her books: "Murdock, D. and S, Acharya. (2009). Christ in Egypt: The Horus-Jesus Connection. [Note: Acharya S is a pen name for D. M. Murdock and she recycles old (19th-century and early 20th-century freethought) myth-theory material of Christian origins. In this book she has a small section discussing the Dendera zodiac and uses long outdated references/sources to claim it likely dates to circa 10,000 BCE (and that Egyptian astronomy was likely this old). Acharya S aka D[orothy]. M. Murdock is completely unreliable and seems incapable (or unwilling) to engage in a scholarly approach. In all her books (most self published) she uses mostly only outdated and unreliable references/sources and seems to be having a joke at the expense of her readers. Her attempts to defend her claims/sources is equally outrageous and seems intent on extending the joke. The author can not distinguish the American freemason Robert Hewitt Brown, author of "Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy" (1882), from the English solicitor Robert Brown Junior, author of "Researches into the Origin of the Primitive Constellations of Greeks, Phoenicians and Romans," (2 Volumes, 1899-1900). In one of her books she incorrectly identifies Robert Brown Junior as the author of "Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy."]"
According to de Santillana and von Dechend mythology all over the world can be reduced to an ancient ur-myth rooted in sophisticated astronomical observations, codified for the sake of secrecy, and then hyper-diffused from its unknown origin in the Near East to the rest of the planet. Hyperdiffusion: Contact between cultures with extreme distances between them. One culture transfers its cultural traits to the others. In the Neolithic world there was no easy system by which knowledge could be passed between cultures and countries and continents.
In looking for patterns within mythology and in interpreting mythology, the type of analysis made and the conclusions determined about the meaning of a myth, will depend on the school of thought (interpretive approach) the myth analyst adheres to. The same evidence elicits different theories. It is highly doubtful if mythology is just one thing. Understanding how to understand the evidence is the issue. No one theory is likely to account satisfactorily for the origin of all myths. Their ages vary considerably and their meanings are likely to be diverse. The existence of fertility myths is a suitable example of a separate genre to any perceived astronomical myths. It is now considered that each myth should be studied separately, and variants compared.
The research methodology formulated by von Dechend - surely no easy task to construct; and its framing important to avoid misinterpretation should have been clearly explained. Von Dechend attempts to analyse individual and comparative mythologies with a single (and speculative) methodological tool (and claims to get it right). Reducing all myths to a single astronomical explanation is not a methodology. The seemingly limited and simplistic methodology used by von Dechend is obviously coloured by her viewpoint, and this should have been acknowledged. Importantly, humans have an eye for finding 'patterns.' This is a problem when patterns are identified that don't really exist - or when specific meanings are superimposed on something very vague. Also, it is a well-known psychological phenomenon that once there is the conviction that a pattern is present, then everything will seem to confirm it, even if objectively there is nothing there.



The nature myth theory/school - to which von Dechend's ideas belong - is externalistic, without psychological components. Myth is simply a reaction to physical nature and knowledge gained of physical nature through human experience. Gods/goddesses are viewed as personifying meteorological forces and astronomical phenomena/objects. However, the nature myth theory/school fails to account for the full content of most myths.
Astronomy and the origin of ancient mythology
Was astronomy the main source of myth as asserted in Hamlet’s Mill? It is generally agreed that no monolithic theory has succeeded or can succeed in achieving universal applicability. It is now generally agreed no single theory of myth can cover all types of myths. There is no one scheme that is the universal key to all myth.
Amanda Laoupi (Centre for the Assessment of Natural Hazards and Proactive Planning (National Technical University of Athens) (NTUA), Greece, simply uses the material in Hamlet's Mill as evidence of environmental disasters. (See: http://www.drgeorgepc.com/DisasterArchSocCultLaoupi.html) Hamlet's Mill is regarded not as a source for fictional astronomical mythology but a source (one of many) for studying the causes of societal and environmental collapse in the civilizations of the past. She writes: "The initial stages of disaster analysis can be found in the texts of ancient writers (e.g. Homer, Hesiod, Herodotus, presocratic philosophers, Hippocrates, Thucydides, tragic poets, Plato, Aristotle, Theophrastus, et al.), where a serious attempt to categorize the causes of natural and man-induced changes both in the environment and human societies, is easily recognizable."

The current status of astral religion/mythology
The current status of astral religion/mythology is somewhat unsettled. Astral religion (worship of the stars) refers to the cultic worship of heavenly bodies or deities (gods/goddesses) associated with them. Babylonian astrology depended essentially on astral religion. However, astral religion, though it had oriental roots i.e., in Babylonia, was fundamentally a Hellenic creation, Pythagorean and Platonic. A fundamental idea of Pythagorean astronomers was the divinity of the astra, especially the planets.
Manfred Hutter has written: "The relationship between a heavenly body and a deity may range from identification to mere association - the boundaries are fluid. There is no astral religion per se, but elements of astral religion appear within particular religious systems. Some scholars have attempted to trace the whole of mythology to astral religion or astral mythology, but such theories are now obsolete. It is important to distinguish astral religion from astrology ...." (See: Hutter, Manfred. "Astral Religion." Religion Past and Present. Brill Online, 2014. Manfred Hutter (born 1957) is a Professor at Bonn University, Department of Comparative Religion. He holds 2 doctorates.) The relationship of astral religion to astrology remains unsettled.
Ancient Near Eastern religions commonly (though not always) associated or identified the visible planets with gods/goddesses. The eminent assyriologist Francesca Rochberg believes that Mesopotamian religion was not astral in nature. Rather, an astronomical body (i.e., sun, moon, planet, star, constellation) might represent a specific god/goddess, but astronomical bodies themselves did not have a god/goddess-like status. (See: Rochberg, Francesca. (2009). "The Stars Their Likenesses." In: Porter, Barbara. (Editor). What Is a God? (Pages 41-91).)
Establishment of horoscopy: - the technique of predicting an individual's future; - mathematical art (causal); based on planetary positions in zodiac, at time of birth; predicted events are inevitable and cannot be avoided. Though largely geometrical Greek horoscopic astrology is still based on concept of astral religion (i.e., gods and goddesses residing in the planets). Also the early belief that planets and stars establish a system of influence on peoples lives by emanating rays.
Zoroastrianism (with its astral cosmology, and celestial realm populated by celestial beings), Mithraism (with its association with astrology), and other similar types of astral religions such as the solar cults of the later Roman Empire (involving astrology) located the gods/goddesses and the proper home of the human soul and special spiritual powers in the celestial realm. The ancient Egyptians identified passage to the afterlife and the attainment of immortality with the passage through the celestial regions, such as the circumpolar region. Astral elements of Zoroastrism (the religion of Zarathustra) were influential – especially the astral origin of the soul. Involving Greek form of Persian myth that the soul comes from the realm of the stars to unite with a living body – and so human character is determined by the heavens. Astrologers were particularly concerned to know the positions of the "heavenly elements" at the moment of the individual's birth, for celestial configurations marked the path that the soul had taken in its descent into the body. These same celestial forces had accordingly exerted, and would continue to exert, an influence on the soul, perhaps determining its experiences. (Introduced into Mesopotamia from Persia.)
Zoroastrianism underwent changes during the Achaemenian era, such as the absorption of Babylonian astral lore. Belief in the development of Zurvanism, a modified form of Zoroastrian religion that supposedly appeared in Persia during the Sasanian period is controversial and likely the uncritical invention of Western scholarship.
Early Sumerian religion was not astral/planetary
There were no planetary gods/goddesses in the earliest Sumerian pantheon. The formal scheme involved An (sky), Enlil (storm), Ninhursaga (fertility), Enki (underground water), Nanna (moon), Utu (Sun), Ereshkigal (underworld), Ezen (grain), etc. It was only much later that the 5 planets were named after gods/goddesses, whose origin had nothing to do with the planets (3 were borrowed from local solar gods): Nergal (Mars), Marduk (Jupiter), and Ninurta (Saturn). Inanna was a rival to the Sumerian earth goddess Ninhursaga who eventually became dominant and associated with Venus. According to the sumerologist Thorkild Jacobsen (The Encyclopedia of Religion edited by Mircea Eliade (1987, Volume 9, Page 451)), "At Uruk - in antiquity as today a center of date culture - there was [Dumuzi-]Amaushumgalana, the power for animal growth and new life of the date palm, and his consort Inanna, earlier Ninana ("mistress of the date clusters")."
Morris Jastrow's numerous publications on Babylonian religion indicate that the association of gods/goddesses with planets was basically arbitrary and also a late development. According to Morris Jastrow (Aspects of Religious Belief and Practice in Babylonia (1911): "The Conception of a god of heaven [i.e., Anu] fits in, moreover, with the comparatively advanced period when the seats of the gods were placed in the skies, and the gods identified with the stars. Such an astral theology, however, is not a part of the earlier religious beliefs of the Babylonians ...." This is supported by more recent scholarship. William Fulco (The Encyclopedia of Religion edited by Mircea Eliade (1987, Volume 7, Page 82, see also Page 145)) writes: "Comparative Semitic evidence suggests that the Akkadian Venus deity was originally masculine but became completely feminized when identified with the female Sumerian deity Inanna. Because of the eventual syncretism of the Sumerian and Akkadian pantheons, the traditions concerning Inanna-Ishtar are extremely complicated. By one such tradition she is the daughter of the sky god An, by another the daughter of the moon god Nanna-Sin (and thereby sister of the sun god Utu-Shamash), and by still another, the daughter of Enlil or Ashur"



By circa the mid-3rd millennium BCE the Sumerian pantheon (later adopted by the Babylonians) was structured with 2 superior triads over the body of lesser gods dominated by those with planetary associations (due to their importance in omenology). These are listed as follows with their sacred (harmonic?) number (often used as the name of the god/goddess) when known in parentheses: 1: An (60), Enlil (50), Enki (40); 2: Nanna (30), Utu (20), Inanna (15); and 3: Ninurta (50), Marduk (10 - changed to 50 by the Babylonians), Neral (12, later 14), Nabu (?), Adad (10), etc. To the Babylonians, the 2 superior triads were: (1) Anu, Enlil, and Ea; and (2) Sin, Shamash, and Ishtar. An/Anu was the overall head of the pantheon with Enlil (and later Marduk, the patron god of Babylon, when it attained political domination of Mesopotamia) being the next most powerful. To the Assyrians, Ashur, patron deity of Ashur, was the overall head of the pantheon (otherwise it closely resembled the pantheon of Babylon).
Recent approaches to mythology by Michael Witzel
The Origins of the World’s Mythologies by E. J. Michael Witzel (2012/2013). (http://www.indologica.de/drupal/?q=node/2455)
Michael Witzel (a comparative linguist) is (Prince of) Wales Professor of Sanskrit at Harvard University (and has his share of critics). He believes his studies (focusing on the oldest available texts, supported by data from archaeology, comparative linguistics, and human population genetics) demonstrate the prehistoric origins of most of the Eurasian and Laurasian mythologies and assembles evidence for a prehistoric Ur-mythology dating back 100,000 years. Witzel characterizes all the past approaches to mythology (myth-and-ritual, comparative, historical, structural, diffusion, archetype) as blind men describing an elephant. He rejects the idea of "mnemotechnical mechanics of myth formation as storage device of Stone Age 'scientific' knowledge" as the be-all-end-all explanation of myth.
Michael Witzel argues for 3 distinct historical layers of myth: Pan-Gaean > Gondwana > Laurasian (originating in Greater Southwest Asia sometime between 50,000 [time Australian, New Guinean migration) to 20,000 ybp (American migration) - i.e., sometime after the second-last ice age). The rationale being that the common features can only be explained by common inheritance; they're too similar in structure to be explained as coincidence or based on archetypes, and too separated geographically and temporally to be explained by diffusion.
See the (English-language) book review essay "The Paleolithic Turn: Michael Witzel's Theory of Laurasian Mythology." by Frederick Smith (Religious Studies Review, Volume 39, Issue 3, September, 2013, Pages 133-142).

Excursus: Some miscellaneous associates of Giorgio de Santillana
Giorgio de Santillana was advisor to George Craig (1914-2002) who taught English at Amherst College from his appointment in 1940 to his retirement in 1985. Craig received his Ph.D. in 1947. The topic of his dissertation was the 17th-century Cambridge Platonist Henry More. Craig’s dissertation was, among other things, about More' prose style and in it Craig combined his literary, philosophical, and scientific interests and knowledge.
The modernist poet and essayist Charles Olson (1910-1970) was an early friend of de Santillana.
A MIT seminar on archaic cosmology presented by Giorgio de Santillana?
There is the likelihood that in 1965 (perhaps circa 1965, 1964?) Giorgio de Santillana may have organised and directed his own seminar on archaic cosmology and science, focusing on the period from 8000 BCE to 2000 BCE aimed at demonstrating the narrowness of the traditional historicistic vision on the origin and early development of science. (See: Italian Quarterly, Volumes 9-10, 1965, Page 87. The Italian Quarterly is an American academic publication.) The issue of Italian Quarterly refers to de Santillana directing a seminar discussing the narrowness of the historical vision of scientific achievements in antiquity. The seminar on the early origins of scientific thought was apparently conducted at University of California. The seminar(s) were likely held in the early evenings and involved Hertha von Dechend. De Santillana was reliant on Jerome Lettvin for advice on organising seminars (at least at MIT). According to Jerome Lettvin, at that period it was very much a hands-on do-it-yourself process.
Also, circa 1964/1965, (apparently) Technology Review, Volume 67, Number 1, November, 1964, Page 64, has a short article mentioning a 1964 (?) MIT seminar on "antiquity of science" (ancient cosmology) conducted by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend. Both are identified with the Department of Humanities. (Note: Volume 66 of Technology Review concluded with Number 9 published in July 1964.) A 1964 seminar is not indicated in other literature - the reference needs to be fully checked. Some excerpts obtainable through Google: "The search for regularity in the universe, a characteristic of modern science, began long before men learned to write, Professor Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend of the Department of Humanities have been pointing out in an M.I.T. seminar. The earliest science they say was archaic cosmology. It preceded the achievements of the Egyptians [!?] and the Greeks, and it was born even earlier than any ... [other recorded civilization]. ... The great creative period seems to comprise the span between 6000 and 2000 B.C. Psychological interpretations of documents found by archaeologists have misled us, Professor de Santillana thinks. From a re-examination of the findings of Nineteenth Century scholars, he and Dr. von Dechend have concluded that astronomy is an even older science than we have been taught, and was effectively diffused long before letters were invented."
There exists a set of course notes titled, Introduction to Cosmology: A Preliminary Reconnaissance by H. von Dechend and G. de Santillana (no date, but 1961). This set of course notes is more coherent than the book. They perhaps were produced at this period (circa 1965).
Note: The seminars attributed to von Dechend were a series of weekly lectures/presentations.
De Santillana's 1966 presentation at NERC
In 1966 MIT hosted the yearly New England Renaissance Conference (NERC). The MIT conference organizer was Richard Douglas. (Roy Lamson may have assisted.) The conference observed the standard 2-day 3 session format – with usual intended informality – beginning Friday afternoon and finishing Saturday morning. The 1966 conference dates were Friday April 29 and Saturday April 30. The New England Renaissance Conference (NERC) is the oldest scholarly association in the U.S. dedicated to the study of the Renaissance. Since its founding in 1939 the NERC has played a significant role in promoting and disseminating scholarship about the Renaissance. During the morning of the Saturday program Giorgio de Santillana presented the 2nd and last paper – "Archaic Cosmology in Renaissance Literature" – for around 1 hour and 15 minutes. (Though the paper may now be lost the type of content may perhaps be gleaned from his book review of Yate's work on Giordano Bruno where he pointed to certain problems presented by the "churning turbid flood" of Hermetic, Cabalistic and other esoteric literature.) The venue for the presentation of the conference papers was the Library Lounge, Hayden Library Building (on Memorial Drive). Conference registration was in the Hayden Library Building, Room 14N-315 (North Wing, 3rd Floor), Roy Lamson, Richard Douglas.
Giorgio de Santillana as historian and polymath



Steven Wolfe describes de Santillana as a forgotten polymath, humanist, and Galileo scholar. One person has perceptively noted: "De Santillana is a thinker who sees into the depths of his topic, looks deep beneath the appearances to see essences ...." Henry Guerlac noted his skill in discovering the unity of the history of science. An example is: Development of Rationalism and Empiricism, with Edgar Zilsel (1941, International Encyclopedia of Unified Science Foundations of the Unity of Science; Volume 2, Number 8, Pages 1-52; 2nd Edition, 1970, Volume 2, Pages 751801). De Santillana also wrote (the pamphlet) Aspects of Scientific Rationalism in the Nineteenth Century. Guerlac also notes that de Santillana's way of viewing the rise of modern science is no longer fashionable. Steven Wolfe also states that nobody reads de Santillana anymore. However, the exception would be the cultist book Hamlet's Mill.
The obituary by his friend Nathan Sivin (Isis, 1976) states: "His office and classroom doors were always open. Those who passed in and out most often were among the most capacious and independent minds MIT has nurtured - Norbert Wiener, Jerome Lettvin, Warren McCullough, Philip Morrison, and Walter Pitts, to name a few." Jerome Lettvin (in 1998) described Giorgio de Santillana as "a most learned and kindly man with a mordant wit." (It is indicated by one source that he could at times be overbearing.) Jerome Lettvin was an especially close friend of Giorgio de Santillana. (An article in Technology Review, Volume 69, 1966, describes circumstances where Giorgio de Santillana would "... next morning ... be in the inner book-lined fortress with Jerry Lettvin, Hertha von Dechend ...." Though de Santillana's official retirement was in 1967 this 1966 article refers to "Emeritius Giorgio de Santillana.")
"Partial retirement has come this summer for nine long-time members of M.I.T. Faculty; all of them will continue with part-time-time teaching assignments next year. ... Giorgio D di (sic) Santillana. ..." (The Technology Review, 1967.)
"Georgio (sic) de Santillana ... was ... a brilliant man, who not only knew most European languages including Latin and Greek, but also knew Western philosophy and the history of science like the palm of his hand. Moreover, he was also a thinker of the deepest kind, a perceptive thinker attracted to traditional thought and critical of most of modern Western philosophy. [Note: De Santillana was especially critical of Herbert Feigl and logical empiricism. Feigl was a leading spokesperson in the USA for logical empiricism.] (In Search of the Sacred by Seyyed Hossein Nasr (2010, Page 39.)"
An example of de Santillana's ability to identify historical issues is his paper on the relations between science and medieval art. In 1957 de Santillana presented a pioneering but somewhat cryptic 30-page paper at an influential conference at the Institute for the History of Science at the University of Wisconsin, maintaining that some of the key ideas of the Scientific Renaissance – specifically new conceptions of space – were to be traced to developments in the arts. (De Santillana, Giorgio. (1959, Reprinted 1962, 1969). "The Role of Art in the Scientific Renaissance." In:
Clagett, Marshall. (Editor). Critical Problems in the History of Science: Proceedings of the Institute for the History of Science at the University of Wisconsin, September 1-11, 1957. (Pages 33-64). (De Santillana may also have published a later 'paper' (1961), "A study of the relations between artistic and scientific thought in the early Renaissance.")) See especially the discussion in the book review essay "The Art of Science." by Geoffrey Cantor (reviewing The Science of Art by Martin Kemp (1990)) in the Oxford Art Journal, Volume 14, Number 1, 1991, Pages 101-104.
But de Santillana had critics. In his book Love and the Idea of Europe (2009, Page 154), Luisa Passerini wrote: "... an immoderate [excessive] piece by Georges [sic] de Santillana, ... claimed that the 'Mediterranean spirit' had passed from Parmenides to Plato and from Leopardi to Valery ...."
Giorgio de Santillana's idealistic vision of the Renaissance that he put forward in his book The Age of Adventure (1956) has been contested. See: "Don Dinero Encounters Don Juan." by Julio Vélez-Sainz; In: Crosscurrents: Transatlantic Perspectives on Early Modern Hispanic Drama (2006) edited by Mindy Bardía and Bonnie Gasior. (Pages 144-162).

Giorgio de Santillana as teacher and writer
In the decade following World War II Giorgio de Santillana was one of a handful of scholars who ensured that the history of science as a discipline was established on a firm scientific footing. It is worth mentioning that Giorgio de Santillana was usually an excellent writer. (He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; and a member of the History of Science Society.) During the 1940s and 1950s he was a contributor to The New Republic, and the Atlantic Monthly. In 1958 he was honoured with the Sidney Hillman Foundation journalism award (magazine reporting category) for his article "Galileo and J. Robert Oppenheimer." (The Reporter (1958)). At MIT Giorgio de Santillana was considered a visionary philosopher. Both de Santillana and Lettvin were regarded as excellent teachers by their students. (Giorgio de Santillana wrote 5 articles on Italian literature for the first edition of the Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature (1947). It is perhaps worth mentioning that Giorgio de Santillana was one of a number of visiting professors at La Scuola Italiana di Middlebury College (Scuola Italian or Casa Italiano), one of the Summer Language Schools of Middlebury College (located at Middlebury Campus, Green Mountains of Vermont).) In 1954 he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His residence at this time was Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1958 the journal Isis (Volume 49, Pages 2) noted that de Santillana was preparing the papers of Vincenzio Viviani for publication. (Vincenzio Viviani (1622–1703), was an Italian mathematician and philosopher to the Grand Ducal Court in Tuscany, and also Galileo's scientific secretary.) He was Fulbright Teaching Fellow in Italy, 1954-1955. The Monthly Supplement, 1955, Page 1742, for the International Who's Who states: "Fulbright fellow in Italy, 19541955." (See also: Harper's Magazine, Volume 212, 1956.) In 1964 (April 16), de Santillana gave The Wilkins Lecture: Galileo Today. It appeared in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Volume 280, 1964, Pages 447-?
Abe Aronow recalls that in the world of Giorgio de Santillana's classes: "the rules of logical scholarship often faded into fantasy with puffs of tobacco smoke, but that did not make the sessions less stimulating, only different." (Before MIT introduced smoking bans both de Santillana and Lettvin would smoke during presenting lectures.) Abe Aronow also recalls: "One of my most enduring memories of Giorgio was a course he put on for one semester, maybe 1961, where he read aloud from the Divine Comedy in the most mellifluous Italian. It was a real treat."
Critique by Otto Neugebauer of the inaccuracies of Giorgio de Santillana as a historian of early science
For a short critique by Otto Neugebauer of the inaccuracies of Giorgio de Santillana as an historian of early science see "The Survival of Babylonian Methods in the Exact Sciences of Antiquity and Middle Ages." in Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Volume 107, Number 6, December 20, 1963, Page 531. See also the short critique of Giorgio de Santillana by Asger Aaboe in the book review "Historians of Science." in The Yale Review, Volume 52, Winter, 1962, Pages 326-328. Further, see the short critique by Marshall Clagett, of de Santillana's uncritical acceptance that Thales predicted a solar eclipse in 585 BCE, in The American Historical Review, Volume LXVII, Number 4, July, 1962, Page 999. Giorgio de Santillana also supported the views of Frances Yates on the Hermetic tradition in the Renaissance. (See his enthusiastic review (endorsement) of her 1964 book Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition in The American Historical Review, Volume 70, Number 2,



January, 1965, Pages 455-457. (This was an influential book that helped to catapult her to academic stardom.)) In 1966 de Santillana (through the Department of Humanities and its Course XXI Club) arranged a lecture by Frances Yates on "Renaissance Science and Hermetic Tradition" at the Hayden Library Lounge (Room 14E-310). Francis Yates was a historian who specialised in the occult aspects of the scientific revolution (i.e., Western Europe, 1550-1700). However, see the extended, devastating analysis of Frances Yates as a flawed historian and scholar by the academic Christopher Lehrich in his book The Occult Mind (2007). Her personal opinions are presented as assumed facts. Many of her assumptions and conclusions have been refuted by more modern scholarship. It is clear her historical reconstructions were wildly speculative and lack any real evidence. Her ideas now have no solid academic support and historical explanations of the Renaissance proceed without them. See also the discussion of the "Yates thesis": "Natural magic, hermeticism, and occultism in early modern science." by Brian Copenhaver, in: David Lindberg and Robert Westman (Editors), Reappraisals of the Scientific Revolution (1990, Pages 261-301). For de Santillana's errors and exaggerations regarding Leonardo da Vinci's use of Latin texts see Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler by David Lindberg (1981, Page 155). (See also: Charles Olson & Cid Corman: Complete correspondence 1950-1964 by Charles Olson and Cid Corman (1987, 2 Volumes, Page 243); edited by George Evans for the comment "(... Giorgio de Santillana, now Prof at MIT) who is bright enough, but who never found a keel for their cut-water in themselves ....)." See also: Letters for 'Origin' 1950-1956 by Charles Olson 1968/9 (Page 155); edited by Alfred Glover.)
First meeting between Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend
Giorgio de Santillana first met Hertha von Dechend when he participated in a symposium organised by Willy Hartner at the Institut für Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften, in Frankfurt, in 1958. (By way of mentioning both were smokers - he a mainly a pipe (but also cigarettes) and she cigarettes. Abe Aronow recalls that de Santillana and von Dechend "both smoked in a decidedly catenary fashion." Due to tobacco smoke Aronow found it difficult to remain in the office for long periods. Tobacco smoke in his office was likely the reason de Santillana had a series of younger lady secretaries.) (Also, long forgotten - if ever really known - is that de Santillana suffered a severe heart attack in 1970, and was hospitalised.) Von Dechend sent de Santillana a summary of her ideas on precessional mythology in 1959 and he immediately accepted her arguments. (Giorgio de Santillana's close support helped the credibility of Hertha von Dechend's ideas. Without the good luck of meeting him her ideas would undoubtedly have remained little known.) (Another version of their 1958 meeting holds that they identified that, by different routes, both had independently reached the conclusion that world-wide myths at the end of the prehistoric era used metaphors to describe celestial phenomena, especially the precession of the equinoxes.) One source holds that during her PhD research (for Die kultische und mythische Bedeutung des Schweins in Indonesien und Ozeanien (completed 1939) von Dechend realised for the first time that the myths of the South Seas inhabitants could only be understood if their science, especially astronomy, is decrypted. However, this ignores the earlier influence of Leo Frobenius and Panbabylonism. After von Dechend completed her Habilitation (a qualification for lecturing in a German university (involving writing another university level thesis and giving a presentation), Dr. habil.) in 1960 de Santillana invited her to the USA that same year for a lake trip vacation. (Her habilitation (Habilitationsschrift) was titled: Der Mythos von der gebauten Welt als Ausdrucksform archaischer Naturwissenschaft. This was the precursor to Hamlet's Mill.) (De Santillana's actual intention was to bring von Dechend to MIT to be a collaborator on a project/book on precessional mythology.) (This Hamlet's Mill project - judging from the state of von Dechend's seminar notes - appears to have been rather chaotic from start to finish. The authors acknowledge in Hamlet's Mill: "Much of the research for this book was supported by a grant from the Twentieth Century Fund." Considering that it was funded research the end result hardly justified the funding.)
Extract from President's Report, Issue 1963, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Bulletin, Volume 99, Number 2, November 1963.
De Santillana knew how to 'work the system' for grants of various kinds. In 1956 de Santillana was the recipient of a travel grant. It appears that William Stahlman (then still teaching at MIT) was also. (See: Bulletin, Volume 4, 1956, Page 14, published by the American Anthropological Association.)
A peculiar error regarding von Dechend at MIT
Terry Lane has incorrectly stated (Sacred Landscape List, November 19, 2003) that von Dechend was a graduate student under de Santillana: "I wrote a letter to Dr. von Dechend via her publisher which she received in Germany. She had been a graduate student under Prof. de Santillana and Hamlet's Mill was her graduate thesis. He was her thesis advisor but most of the book was her work, not his, as she told me." By the time von Dechend visited the USA (MIT) at the invitation of de Santillana she had completed her habilitation (Habilitationsschrift).
Von Dechend was never a student of de Santillana. Hamlet's Mill was based on her 'scrambled' MIT seminar notes. These drew on her Habilitation thesis which was influenced by her PhD dissertation.
Giorgio de Santillana's several marriages
One puzzle concerned several authors maintaining that Giorgio de Santillana was married. Bruce Mazlish, a long-serving Professor of History at MIT, recounts Giorgio de Santillana was known as "the cat who walks alone." (Possibly a reference to his late-night solo walks on MIT campus.) MIT colleague information is that he remained a bachelor. It was popularly believed that he was a bachelor. Neil Smalheiser (2000) described him as a "bachelor popular with the ladies." De Santillana was described as having considerable charm. (I am also informed that another person who knew him well described him as being quite a womaniser.) However, after considerable research, I identified in 2009 that a number of persons asserted that he was married (at one time) and his wife Dorothy de Santillana was senior editor/managing editor at Houghton Mifflin Company (Trade Division). (See for example: Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography by James Sloan (1996, Page 173; and Sunset and Twilight: From the Diaries of 1947-1958 by Bernard Berenson (1963, Page 373).) In his mid 40s Giorgio de Santillana married Dorothy Tilton. Who was Who in America with World Notables (2007, Page 110, Entry: Giorgio de Santillana) states that Giorgio de Santillana married Dorothy Tilton on September 1, 1948 [in Massachusetts]. The issue of de Santillana's marriage(s) is somewhat intriguing. When I recently (September, 2009) asked the ever competent and prolific researcher and writer Richard Flavin for assistance he promptly resolved the issue for me. The biography for Giorgio de Santillana in the Gale online database (2009) Contemporary Authors Online states in [September] 1948 he married Dorothy Hancock Tilton. I have since identified Contemporary Authors: New Revision Series, Volume 100 (2001, Page 117) edited by Scot Peacock as a source. (They also stated in some sources to have had two sons: Ludovico and Geraldo (= Gerald). However, Dorothy was not the mother, and was Giorgio's 2nd wife.) It appears that at the time of their marriage they lived in an apartment at 84 Mt. Vernon Street on Beacon Hill (Boston, across from the common) and later moved to a house in Beverly Farms, a neighbourhood at the eastern edge of the city of Beverly (Massachusetts), some 20 miles north of Boston. (The Social Register, Boston (1949, Page 69 lists (somewhat cryptically): Mr & Mrs Giorgio Diaz Santillana (Dorothy Hillyer). (This Beverly house is described by James Watson (Avoid Boring People: Lessons for a Life in Science (2007, Page 221) as an "elegant large square wooden house.") Stanley H. Hillyer (H. Tilton) is also mentioned. The Social Register (1952, Page 45 lists: Mr & Mrs Giorgio Diaz Santillana (Dorothy H. Tilton Hillyer), Beverly Cove, Massachusetts.) Richard Flavin also kindly brought to my attention the obituary for Dorothy de Santillana in The Boston Globe (a daily newspaper) for 25th June, 1980, Page 1. The Gale database entry opens doors. At least by 1955 Dorothy Tilton was still signing her letters Dorothy de Santillana.

The house at Beverly was quite magnificent. "I finally got to see the de Santillana's pink palazzo the other night, and I have never seen a more beautiful house anywhere. ... Dorothy is simply the most talented woman with houses I have known." (As Always, Julia: The Letters of Julia Child and Avis DeVoto edited by Joan Reardon (2010, Page 137).) James Watson (Avoid Boring People (2007, Page 221) writes with the implication that the "elegant large square wooden house" belonged to Dorothy de Santillana.
A Venini chandelier based on a design by Napoleone Martinuzzi in clear glass and aluminum, given by Paolo Venini to Mr. & Mrs. Giorgio Diaz de Santillana in 1948, height 35′′ diameter 33′′. (A matching pair of sconces, height 18′′ width 17′′ was also included?) Also, apparently, another large Venini colourless blown glass chandelier designed by Napoleone Martinuzzi circa 1952 was also a gift from Paolo Venini to Dorothy and Giorgio de Santillana in the early 1950s.
Tracing Ludovico de Santillana (March 6,1931, Rome-March 15, 1989, Arezzo) and Gerald(o) de Santillana is presently a little more perplexing. (Ludovico was born in 1931 in Rome and sources are certain that Gerald(o) was born in 1939, but I am unable to identify where. They were children by de Santillana's first marriage. (At least one source incorrectly states that Ludovico was the son of Giorgio and Dorothy. The source also incorrectly claims - perhaps following Eleanor Murdock - that Ludovico moved to Italy and became an architect.) Gerald(o) likely came to the USA (as a permanent resident) after WWII. Exactly when he came to the USA is unknown.) Giorgio de Santillana dedicated his book The Crime of Galileo (1955) to Ludovico and Anna de Santillana and included the date 28th December, 1953, and the Latin abbreviation Q.B.F.S. They are clearly identifiable as Ludovico de Santillana (architect and glass artist, March 6, 1931 (Rome) - March 15, 1989 (Arezzo)) and Anna Venini (glass artist, and a daughter of Paolo Venini (and Ginette Gignous (born Stresna, 1891-died Venice, 1982)), glass artist) who married in 1923. Note: One source misprints 1953 for 1923. (Ludovico may have died of a tobacco-related illness. He was a pipe-smoker.) Paolo Venini was a native of Cusano (near Milan) who originally trained as an attorney. (The life dates for Paolo Venini are given by one source as born 1895-died prematurely 1959.) Ludovico graduated from the University of Architecture in Venice, where he was to teach, as Ignazio Gardella's assistant, up until 1964. In 1963 he married Anna Venini. This led to Ludovico designing glass for his father-in-law and eventually taking over the firm (the director and owner of the Venini Factory in Mura, in 1985, after the death of the owner). However, one source states: "His son-in-law. Ludovico Diaz de Santillana (1931-1989) ran the company until 1985, when the glassworks passed out of family hands." Correctly, Ludovico Diaz de Santillana, at the request of Paolo Venini, headed the company from 1959 until 1985. More accurately, Ginette (Gignous) Venini, his widow, and Ludovico Diaz di Santillana, succeeded Paolo as Directors and Artistic Directors, and carried on his work. One Venini source states: "... from the holder’s death in 1985 he became the director of the Venini ...." Ludovico concentrated on the production of large lamps and chandeliers. (One source states he took over the firm from his brother-in-law in 1959.) Also, in her book My years at Villa I Tatti (1980, Page 63) Eleanor Murdock mentions a person named Ludovico de Santillana as being a son of Giorgio and also mentions Ludovico's wife Anna. (The glass artists Ludovico and Anna de Santillana had 2 children, Laura de Santillana (Laura Diaz de Santillana) (born in Venice, Italy, 1955 (some sources incorrectly state 1950), and starting 1977 studied at the School of Visual Arts in New York, previously attended Liceo classico, Venice, Italy ) and Alessandro de Santillana (Italian, born in Paris, 18 July 1959, studied at the University of Venice, became an architect, then joined the family firm Venini in 1981). Both Laura and Alessandro are respected artists who have enjoyed successful solo careers. Currently (2011) Laura de Santillana lives in Venice and works in Murano. She is described as an "artist who has created exceptional and sometimes unexpected examples of art glass.") In their book Italian Glass, Murano, Milan, 1930-1970: The Collection of the Steinberg Foundation (Art & Design) (1997, Page 322) the authors
Helmut Ricke and Eva Schmitt state that Ludovico Diaz de Santillana (born 1931, Rome - died (after a lengthy illness) 1989, Arezzo) was the son of the philosopher Giorgio Diaz de Santillana. (One source states he died in Terranova Bracciolini.) (Ludovico Diaz de Santillana, (Architect, designer, and entrepreneur), 1937-1949, attended and graduated from a French High School in Rome; 1949-1956, studied architecture in Venice. He graduated with a degree in Architecture.)
In mid December 2013 I finally located an Italian-language document that identifies Anne Jonkman, a Dutch National, and strict Calvinist, as the mother of Ludovico Diaz de Santillana, and Giorgio Diaz de Santillana as the father. See also the 1936 Passenger Manifest above where Giorgio de Santillana identifies himself as married. Likely he married Anne circa the time he became an instructor at the University of Rome (in 1929). Geraldo was born in 1939. Giorgio de Santillana finally abandoned Italy in 1938. His divorce from his first wife Anne Jonkman was obviously finalised between 1938 and 1948. (I am presuming that Anne Jonkman survived WWII.) So, in the end, Giorgio de Santillana had 2 failed marriages. However, it is not obvious that he abandoned his first marriage by leaving for the USA. As a Jew he needed to leave Europe at that time. It appears Anne Jonkman would not leave Europe. Anne Jonkman obviously had no Jewish heritage, and it was safer for her to remain in Europe. When de Santillana originally left in 1936 he returned in 1938 before leaving again.
At the end of August 2015 I located a death notice and a cemetery/burial reference for Anne Diaz de Santillana.
Death notice sources: (1) Nieuwe Leidsche Courant, Page 9, Donderdag 21 Januari 1954. (2) Utrechtsch Nieuwsblad, Dinsdag 19 Januari 1954, Page 3.
The headline reads: "Sister of former minister Jonkman deceased." She died after a long-term illness. Interestingly she is also identified as a Marquise.
Source: The Protestant Cemetery Catalogue - Det Danske Institut i Rom edited by Sebastian Rahtz (January 2000); Country DU: Holland, Page 157. It appears they are buried in Rome.
Anne Jonkman (born 1899, Utrecht - died 1954, Rome) was apparently buried with her father in Rome (not Holland) under her married name, Anne Diaz de Santillana. (For whatever reason she kept her married name and also never remarried.) She was the daughter of the Dutch Calvinist and academic, Henricus Franciscus Jonkman (born 1846, Leeuwarden - died January 1924, Rome). His life dates are sometimes erroneously given as 1844-1920. Album Promotorum Utrecht 1815-1936 (Album Promotorum der Rijks Universiteit Utrecht) has the entry (page 139): "Jul. 12
[1879] Henricus Franciscus Jonkman, geb. te Leeuwarden, Math. et Phil. nat., De geslachtsgeneratie der Marattiaceeën. 1) [1) magna cum laude] Rauwenhoff". Also mentioned in another publication as "privaat. Proefechrift". He was primarily a botanist and taught botany. See: Jaarboek der Rijks-Universiteit te Utrecht 1878-1879. According to one source he was president of the People's University in Utrecht.
Information on Gerald (Geraldo) de Santillana is presently more difficult and uncertain. Sufficient sources confirm that Gerald(o) was born in 1939. It appears that Geraldo immigrated to the USA after WWII. A person named Gerald de Santillana attended Pomona College and in 1960 his B.A. Thesis was British public opinion on the Sepoy mutiny, 1857-1858. A person named Gerald(o) de Santillana (and on one occasion Gerald N. de Santillana) appears in the records of the US Department of State/Secretary of State. His names appears in a number of Wikileaks cables. Gerald de Santillana's job activities include: In July 1973 he was a Political Officer with authority to classify documents as secret or confidential; in October 1974 he was an Economic/Commercial Officer, and at that time attended the Regional Commercial Officer Conference in Nairobi; in



1976 he was a desk officer; in 1983 Geraldo N. de Santillana was posted to Haiti (Foreign Service Post). In 2005 Gerald de Santillana contributed to Partners of America. In 1956 and 2010, Eileen and Gerald de Santillana appear in records. Eileen and Gerald de Santillana CdeP 1956 either joined or donated to The Diamond Hitch Club. On November 18, 2010 Eileen C de Santillana and Gerald L de Santillana sold their house at 1806 Barbee Street, Mclean, (Fairfax County) Virginia, 22101, to Yuzhi Liu. The 1458 square feet, 4 bedroom house on 0.27 acres was sold for $650,000. Circa 2010 Eileen de Santillana was part of the Volunteer Program to the Clinical Center (National Institute of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland). In September 2011 (at least) Eileen de Santillana was on the Committee of the Santa Barbara Newcomers Club. Page 779 of the Journal of the Assembly, Legislature of the State of California (1960) mentions "Gerald de Santillana of Santa Barbara." The Foreign Service List (1962) by the United States Department of State lists Gerald L de Santillana. In 1966 at least a Gerald(Geraldo) de Santillana was a political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Lima. Abe Aronow briefly spoke to Gerald(o) on the phone in the 1960 and thinks he was perhaps then living in Puerto Rico. However, Peru is most likely. In the 1970s and 1980s a Gerald(o) de Santillana was Director of the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs. (See: A history of organized labor in Peru and Ecuador by Robert Alexander and Eldon Parker (2007, Page 89).) In 2005 a Gerald de Santillana is mentioned as a significant donor in Partners of the Americas: 2005 Annual Report. Some names and dates appear less puzzling if Giorgio de Santillana had a family in Rome prior to coming to the USA from Paris in 1936. Additionally, the Italian architect Ludovico Diaz de Santillana is stated to have brothers. Urban Glass (Fall, 2009, Volume 7, Issue 3, Page 3) states that Laura Venini Hillyer was the sister of (the late) Anna Diaz de Santillana (who was the wife of Ludovico de Santillana). It presently appears that the/an Italian-born son of Giorgio de Santillana, Ludovico de Santillana, married Anna Venini (de Santillana) (a daughter of the lawyer and famous glass artist Paolo Venini (1895-1959)) in 1953, and the son of Dorothy Tilton Hillyer, Stanley Hancock Hillyer, married Laura Venini (Hillyer) (another daughter of Paolo Venini) a year later in 1954. Anna Venini de Santillana is presently a consultant of the Fondazione Giorgio Cini in Venice.
According to one source: Paolo Venini's older daughter Laura studied languages at Oxford and the Sorbonne. (She was educated in the classics at Liceo Classico Marco Foscarini and studied languages at the University of Ca' Foscari in Venice and at Oxford after the war. She left university in 1948 to work for her father.) She accompanied her father as a translator on his trip to the USA in 1952. When in New York, they took in an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art that included his glass, and there Laura met Stanley Hillyer, who she would marry in Venice1954 (and they would move back to the USA 4 years later). They had 2 daughters, Elizabeth and Francesca. Stanley Hillyer was Ludovico de Santillana's half brother and a son from Dorothy's de Santillana's first marriage to Robert Hillyer. Anna Venini de Santillana became the unofficial Venini historian. Her sister Laura Venini Hillyer, who was also a hard worker, became a business executive. When she was widowed in 1975, Laura moved to New York, and went to work at the celebrated design firm Vignelli Associates, a multi-disciplinary design studio, initially as an office manager, and later she came to be appointed Vice President. There she served also as personal assistant to Massimo Vignelli, a cofounder of the firm and protégé of her father. After her retirement in 1992, she moved back to her home Beverly. Laura Venini Hillyer died January 29, 2013, after a short illness. She was predeceased by her sister, Anna Venini. (See the Obituary in The New York Times (Online), March 5/6. 2013.) Laura Venini Hillyer's extensive glassware estate was put up for auction by Northeast Auctions online on Memorial Day Weekend 2013.
Abe Aronow recalls de Santillana making a comment to him to the effect that great or important men probably needed to be married twice, once to have children and again later to have an intellectual partner and companion. (One wonders from this somewhat odd remark whether de Santillana believed that the prime function of wives was to produce children for their husbands.) Also, from the one time he met de Santillana's 2nd wife Dorothy (at dinner at their home, at Beverly (part of Massachusetts's North Shore region, about 20 miles north of Boston.), she seemed to be the intellectual partner and companion.
Excursus: Biographical information for Dorothy Tilton
Dorothy Tilton was born in 1904(1906?) and died unexpectedly in 1980. (See entries under Hillyer in: American Women, Volume 1, 1935, Page 412; and Principal Women of America, Volume 2, 1936, Page 191.) (Somewhat confusingly, another source states: Dorothy Tilton, Born 15-111918 Massachusetts, Died 29-12-1988, Aged 70 years. A different person may be meant.) Dorothy Hancock Tilton was the daughter of John Tilton (1870-1950) and Elizabeth (Seeley) Tilton (1861-1944). John Tilton was a wealthy real estate and insurance broker residing in Haverill (an uppermiddle class suburb north of Boston, Massachusetts. (He was sufficiently prosperous to collect art.) In the Report, Humane Society of Massachusetts, for 1908, John Tilton is mentioned as receiving their Bronze Medal (connected with actions during a drowning incident?)
Dorothy Tilton was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts (other sources state Boston, Charlestown, Massachusetts in 1904), attended Goucher College, and was a graduate of Radcliffe College (a women's liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts, affiliated with Harvard University). Dorothy de Santillana is variously described as "beautiful and enormously fat," "fat and fierce," (it appears she had a rare glandular condition), "daunting," "formidably outgoing," "a great natural force," and a "wonderful editor." Shannon Ravenel, who worked at Houghton Mifflin for Dorothy de Santillana, wrote: "... the fat, formidably outgoing Senior Editor, Dorothy de Santillana ...." (It was also stated that "men gravitated to her like flies.") One writer described Dorothy de Santillana as "holding great personal prestige."
In 1926 Dorothy Tilton married the poet Robert Hillyer (1895-1961), who was one of her teachers at Radcliffe College, and in 1943 they were divorced (in Reno). In the US Federal Census for 1930 both Robert Hillyer and Dorothy Hillyer are listed as teachers in Windham County, Connecticut. (In the 1940 United States Federal Census their address is given as "Residence: 1935 - Pomfret, Windham, Connectcut.) Robert Hillyer was married 3 times. In 1937 Robert Hillyer was named Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard College. He received a Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1934 for The Collected Poems of Robert Hillyer (1933). He dedicated the book to his wife and son. In 1944 he retired to Old Greenwich, Connecticut. Robert Hillyer and Dorothy Tilton had a single child, a son, Stanley Hancock Hillyer. After serving as book editor of The Boston Globe in the late 1930s and very early 1940s, she joined Houghton Mifflin Company of Boston as an Assistant Editor in 1941. Between 1941 and 1969 Dorothy Tilton was progressively Editor (The Pittsburgh Press, Sunday, January 16, 1944, Pages 16 has: Dorothy Hillyer, Editor), then, at least by 1948 - as she was using the name Dorothy de Santillana - Managing Editor (Trade Department of Houghton Mifflin), then Senior Editor at Houghton Mifflin Company in Boston. (At the time she was Senior Editor - using the name Dorothy Hillyer - the address of the Houghton-Mifflin Company was 222 Berkeley Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02116.) (Names & Numbers 1964-1965 (published 1963) gives: Mrs Dorothy Santillana, Houghton Mifflin Co, 2 Park Street, Boston 7, Mass.) From 1969 onwards she was Executive Editor. (In 1936 she was one of a small group of people who established in Brooklyn an associated chapter of New York's Museum of Modern Art. ) She retired in 1973. During her editorial career of more than 30 years with Houghton Mifflin Company she was principally an editor of fiction, although she also dealt with other literary forms and was recognised for discovering and developing of young talent. Among writers with whom she worked were Jerzy Kosinski, Archibald MacLeish and Willie Morris.
The Pulitzer Prize-winning author and historian, also Professor of History Emeritus at Northwestern University, Garry Wills (1934- ), writes the following recollection about Dorothy de Santillana (Outside Looking In: Adventures of an Observer (2010).): "I ... got a call from Dorothy de Santillana, an editor at Houghton Mifflin publishing house in Boston. She ... told me "You have to write a book about Nixon." I replied that I had now said everything I knew about him - and besides, I did not think he could win in November. (So much for my political prescience.) She maintained that what I wrote about America - its conflicted Cold War liberalism - was what she wanted to hear more of, whether Nixon won or lost. I was not convinced. She said, "Would you at least come up from Baltimore to New York, and let me go down from Boston, to talk this over?" I did not know then what I learned later, that Dorothy had a gift for getting the first book (or the first important one) from writers she set



her sights on - she had edited early books from David Halberstam and Robert Stone. She was married to the Renaissance historian at MIT, Giorgio de Santillana, and she had a wide cultural vision, which, at our New York dinner, she fit my article into. ... After taking on the book assignment, I boarded Nixon's campaign plane (a far bigger deal than the one he was flying in January, when I had first joined him). ... Dorothy de Santillana read each draft of the book and found me some extra advances as it grew in bulk. She went to bat for me with other editors when they tried to kill my title, Nixon Agonistes - they said no one could pronounce the second word, people would be intimidated by it, afraid to ask for it in book stores. She pointed out that two of the most famous poems in the English language were Milton's Samson Agonistes and Eliot's Sweeney Agonistes. When the book came out, she arranged for a launch party at Sardi's in New York, and the senior publishing board came down from Boston for it."
Avis DeVoto writes: "She [Dorothy de Santillana] is now married to Giorgie (sic) de S. who ... teaches history of philosophy at MIT and is a darling. They go abroad every summer – well, almost – and might very well see you in Paris this year. You’ll die when you meet Dorothy because she is very beautiful and enormously fat – I think this is really one of the rare glandular cases – it makes no difference because she is a great natural force and men gravitate to her like flies." (As Always, Julia: The Letters of Julia Child and Avis DeVoto edited by Joan Reardon (2010, Pages 419-420).)
Dorothy de Santillana took private cooking lessons in New York with Dione Lucas (a British-born celebrity Chef and TV presenter) who began the Cordon Bleu restaurant and cooking cooking school in New York.
Whether Dorothy Tilton was ever divorced or legally separated from Giorgio de Santillana is not yet known. It is likely that neither was the case, but it appears there was a rift in the marriage. In his 1970 protest letter to the Editor of the New York Review of Books, Giorgio de Sanillana signed it "Giorgio de Santillana, Beverly, Mass." Apparently he was still living in the same house as his 2nd wife, Dorothy Tilton - unless she had moved out. (The Massachusetts Death Index gives her name as "Dorothy Desantillana.") At the time of her death (1980, aged 76) she lived on Curtis Point (The Massachusetts Death Index states Beverly, Massachusetts).
The estate of Dorothy de Santillana was sold at auction on Friday, June 26, 1981, by Christie, Manson & Woods International Inc (New York).
Dorothy de Santillana (played by actress Helen Coxe) was a character in the 2009 movie Julie and Julia (based on the autobiographical book of the same name).
Actress Helen Coxe in the role of Dorothy de Santillana in the 2009 film Julie and Julia.
According to The Boston Globe, Dorothy de Santillana had two grandchildren, Elizabeth and Francesca Hillyer, both of Beverly. (No children of Dorothy de Santillana are mentioned.) Elizabeth Hillyer is a veterinarian and part editor of the book Ferrets, Rabbits, and Rodents: Clinical Medicine and Surgery (1996). Francesca Hillyer is an educationalist(?) and part author of Diversity in Action (1998). Stanley Hillyer (1927-1969) graduated from MIT and in the mid 1940s completed postgraduate studies at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire. In 1948 he was living in Boston; in 1950 he graduated from MIT; and in 1954 he married Laura Venini at Venice, Italy, and they had a family of two daughters (Elisabeth Hillyer and Francesca Hillyer). His wife, Laura Venini Hillyer, was vice president of Vignelli Associates, a New York design concern. Stanley Hillyer was the executive vice president of Far Eastern operations for Raytheon in Waltham, Massachusetts. In 1966 he was named its senior corporate representative in the Far East with headquarters in Tokyo. (He died in the USA.)
The New York Times, August 28, 1988: "Dr. Elizabeth Hillyer Marries. Dr. Elizabeth Venini Hillyer, a daughter of Mrs. Stanley H. Hillyer of New York and Beverly, Mass., and the late Mr. Hillyer, was married yesterday to Stephen Ward Parker, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Cortlandt Parker of Bedminster, N.J., and Portsmouth, R.I. The Rev. Barbara Platt-Hendren and the Rev. Frederick Baldwin performed the ceremony at St. John's Episcopal Church in Beverly Farms, Mass. Mrs. Parker, who will retain her name professionally, is a staff member of the Animal Medical Center in New York. An alumna of Concord Academy and a cum laude graduate of Yale College, she received a degree in veterinary medicine from Tufts University. Her mother, Laura V. Hillyer, is a vice president of Vignelli Associates, a New York design concern. Mr. Hillyer was the executive vice president of Far Eastern operations for Raytheon in Waltham, Mass. The bride is a granddaughter of the late Ginette Venini and the late Paolo Venini, the founder of Venini Glass in Venice. She is a granddaughter also of the late Robert Silliman Hillyer, the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard College, who received a Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1934, and of the late Dorothy Hancock Tilton de Santillana, a senior editor of the Houghton Mifflin publishing house."
Excursus: Clarifying the marriages to Paolo Venini's 2 daughters
Giorgio de Santillana and his 2nd wife Dorothy, both of whom had sons by previous marriages who, as circumstance would have it, married Venini's two daughters. Giorgio's son, Ludovico (1931-1989), married Anna Venini (Anna Venini Diaz de Santillana). Dorothy's son, Stanley (died 1969), married Laura Venini (Laura Venini Hillyer). (Life dates for Paolo Venini, originally a lawyer from Milan: 1895-1959. Life dates for Ginette (nee Gignous) Venini (Gignous-Venini), a designer: 1891-1982. Anna Venini's mother was Ginette Venini. Anna's children are Laura and Alessandro. Laura Venini's mother was Ginette Venini. Laura's children are Elizabeth and Francesca. Life dates for Anna Venini: 1929-2009 (but also given by one source as 1921-1986). Life dates for Laura Venini (who died after a short illness): 1926-2013.)
Excursus: Robert Hillyer Papers
The 'Robert Hillyer Papers' are held at the Special Collections Research Center, Syracuse University Libraries, 222 Waverly Avenue, Syracuse, NY 13244-2010. Family correspondence in Box 6 contains, among other material, his comments on his marriage to Dorothy Tilton. Access to the material in Box 6 is restricted. "Permission to read family correspondence (Box 6) must be granted by Laura V. (Mrs. Stanley H.) Hillyer; upon her death, permission must be granted by either of her two daughters, Elizabeth V. Hillyer or Francesca P. Hillyer. Mrs. Hillyer is also to be contacted when anyone is interested in the scholarly use of Robert Hillyer's works and papers."
Ludovico Diaz de Santillana's teaching appointment at MIT
At the time of the death of Paolo Venini in 1959 Ludovico was in Paris attending to a project, before leaving for the USA where he had gained a teaching position. His appointment was: Assistant at the Faculty of Architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (also described as a professorship teaching architecture). With his wife about to give birth to their second son Alexander, and the unexpected death of Paolo Venini, it may be that he did not take up the appointment.

Biography of Hertha von Dechend
Hertha von Dechend is described as a cultured person. Hertha von Dechend was born in Heidelberg, Germany, on 5 October 1915. Her parents were Dr. phil. Alfred von Dechend and Elsbeth (née Krohn). Her grandfather, Hermann von Dechend, had been the first President of the Reichsbank. Dr. Alfred von Dechend was a Chemist. In 1913 he completed his doctoral dissertation on chemistry; Üeber die genaue Messung der Lichtbrechung in Gasen; at Ruprecht-Carls-Universität zu Heidelberg. From 1907-1910 he was assistant to Professor Max Trautz (sometimes misspelled as Trauts) in Freiburg in Baden. Hertha von Dechend's father Alfred, a chemist, lost his job in the economic crisis beginning in Germany in 1929 (the collapsing German economy) and separated from the family. Hertha von Dechend studied ethnology, philosophy, and archaeology at the University of Frankfurt am Main. She obtained her doctorate in 1939. It remains unpublished. In 1943 she was Assistant, Institute for the History of Science, Frankfurt am Main. (Another source states she graduated in 1943 in Frankfurt and afterwards was employed at the Institute for the History of Natural Sciences.) In 1966 she was Associate Professor. Von Dechend died on 23 April 2001 after a short but severe illness.
Unlike Giorgio de Santillana, she was not a polymath (though some proponents of her ideas like to claim she was).
From 1923 to 1928 the Dechend family and the Caspari family lived in the same house (70 Mountain Road, in Heidelberg). It appears her childhood was a happy one, with close attention from her mother. Hertha von Dechend and Lotte Caspari remained lifelong close friends. Hertha von dechend memorized into old age all the details (name and "fate") of each main character of her children's books. She also remembered song lyrics from her youth.
In 1925, she began at the Heidelberger Mädchenrealgymnasiums (1925, Heidelberg girls secondary school; and in 1930 she began at the Gymnasium Branck/Department at the same school (in die gymnasiale Abteilung derselben Schule)). When a student at the Gymnasium branch of the Girls Grammar School, Heidelberg, von Dechend mastered Latin and Greek. Her teacher was Prof. Theo Hänlein. In 1934 she began at high school. According to Uta Lindgren (a good friend) von Dechend's rejection of the Nazis was so open and clear that she received her high school diploma (Abiturzeugnis) only with difficulty.
Music was a serious career challenger for Hertha von Dechend. At 13 years of age she received violin lessons from Gösta Andreasson who was a renowned classical violinist for the Busch String Quartet (was 2nd violinist). At 15 years of age von Dechend made a decision in favour of a career in science but never completely separated herself from music. Throughout her early academic career she continued to play violin with various classical string quartets.
When she was 19 years old, von Dechend began informal studies at the Museum für Völkerkunde in Frankfurt. According to Uta Lindgren: It was in 1934, without having a study permit, that von Dechend found a haven at the municipal Museum of Ethnology in Frankfurt where Leo Frobenius had been appointed director in 1932. There she participated in the production of the magazine and the organisation of the artifacts.
Von Dechend did not become a member of the League of German Girls. She made Jewish friends at the Heidelberg Hauptbahnhof (major railway station) as they were leaving for Palestine (after receiving permission to leave Germany). Whilst studying at university she also took risks and gave assistance (such as accommodation) to socially oppressed persons.
From 1934 she worked in Frankfurt/Main at the Frobenius Institute (since 2001 known as the Museum der Weltkulturen (Museum of World Cultures). The museum was directed by Leo Frobenius (who lacked formal training as an anthropologist/ethnologist) until his death in 1938. Initially, von Dechend lacked permission to study (Studienerlaubnis), but managed to obtain a certificate (Abiturzeugnis). Her difficulties were related to her staunch and public opposition to Nazism, which led her to disguise her interests with focuses on archaeology and the study of ancient languages. After performing her obligatory national service (Arbeitsdienst), von Dechend enrolled at the University of Frankfurt am Main (the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University). Von Dechend studied ethnology, philosophy, and archaeology at the University of Frankfort am Main. According to Richard Flavin she majored in archaeology and ethnology. However, she cannot be considered, as one source claims, both an ethnologist and archaeologist, and a major figure in German ethnology. She basically dabbled in her version of comparative mythology and was a minor ethnologist and not at all to be considered an archaeologist. (According to one source in 1936 she was exempted? from the Labor Service (leistete sie den Arbeitsdienst ab).) In the winter semester 1936/37 she began ethnographic studies at the University of Frankfurt. She still remained working at the "Research Institute of Cultural Morphology" and remained working there, managing the private library of Leo Frobenius until his death in 1938.
From 1939 to 1945 von Dechend is listed in the Frobenius Institute records as an associate fellow. (One source states her position of research assistant from 1939 to 1946 was "half-time.") From 1941 to 1960 she was Secretary, Librarian and Assistant Professor at the Institute for the History of Science (IGN). Her employer there was Prof. Dr. Willy Hartner. (The webpage of the Frobenius-Institut records: "Ethnologist and archaeological astronomer. High-school teacher at the Institut für Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften, Frankfurt/M. (1943-1980).") Note: The term "archaeoastronomer" is really only a pseudo academic term. Besides, von Dechend was not by training or experience an archaeologist or an astronomer. According to some sources she was only from November 1943 temporarily at IGN. According to Schipper, Björn. (2006). "Verzeichnis der Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter des Frobenius-Instituts." In: Kohl, Karl-Heinz. and Platte, Editha. (Editors). Gestalter und Gestalten - 100 Jahre Ethnologie in Frankfurt am Main. (Pages 241-256); Hertha von Dechend was a research assistant from 1939 to 1946



(wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin). The current (2015) webpage for the Frobenius-Institut an der Goethe-Universität - Frankfurt am Main, gives the following summary information about Hertha von Dechend: "Ethnologist and archaeological astronomer. High-school teacher at the Institut für Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften, Frankfurt/M. (1943-1980) . Extent and type of legacy: about forty removal boxes. Accessibility: partly processed in the form of an electronic database." There is a letter of dismissal (or statement of employment) from the Research Institute of Cultural Morphology signed by Prof. Dr. Adolf Jensen, 20(25?)-11-1946.
In 1939, during WWII, von Dechend completed her doctoral thesis and received her doctorate with a thesis on an ethnological subject. The topic was: "The ritual and mythical significance of the pig in Indonesia and Oceania." (It remains unpublished.) The topic of her thesis may have been suggested by Frobenius. The date of the thesis examination was 8 November 1939. (Von Dechend does not appear to have carried out (completed) any notable or 'hands on' ethnographic work.) Von Dechend should not be considered an ethnologist in the modern sense of the term. She was definitely not a fieldworker. Von Dechend did not perform any significant fieldwork. She perhaps can be viewed as working within the classificatory (comparative) and diffusionist models of human history. Von Dechend's PhD thesis is not included in, The Importance of the Pig in Pacific Island Culture: An Annotated Bibliography (Secretariat of the Pacific Community, 2007, 45 pages).
In 1940 von Dechend continued her study of the history of science and philosophy at the University of Frankfurt. However, during 1940-1941 von Dechend became assigned to the Luftwaffe Intelligence in Paris. (However, her political stance had not altered.) According to Uta Lindgren, although von Dechend did not understand a word of French, she quickly made contact with the ethnologists at the Musée de l'Homme. Von Dechend, when employed as a secretary in Paris in the services of the Military Commander learned about Gestapo plans for a raid and assisted the resistance group Musée de l'Homme to escape. (See: The Military in Politics and Society in France and Germany in the Twentieth Century by Klaus Müller (1995, Page 147).) The Musée de l'Homme = the Anthropology Museum in the Palais de Chaillot. The Groupe du musée de l'Homme (= Group of the Museum of Man) was resistance group comprised of French intellectuals. It was the centre of early resistance to the German occupation of France. In January 1942 they were denounced and many of them were executed. Leo Frobenius also resisted Nazi ideals.
In 1943, von Dechend held a half-time position at the Institute for the History of Science in Johann Goethe University (now the University of Frankfurt am Main). It appears she played an integral part in running the university when Willy Hartner, the founder of the Institute for the History of Natural Sciences, was on leave at Harvard. Von Dechend was also instrumental in building the university's library. In 1943 Willy Hartner succeeded in establishing an Institute for the History of Science in Frankfurt, which was later (the IGN itself was closed (merged) in 2009) incorporated into the Department of Physics. At the establishment of the Institute he engaged the ethnologist Hertha von Dechend as a secretary, librarian and assistant.
A source for understanding the history of the Institute for the History of Natural Sciences.
It is obvious the Willy Hartner employed because he knew her from his time at the Frobenius Institute, she - like himself - had been staunchly antiNazi, she had senior academic qualifications, and she had the experience initially required when he was establishing the IGN.
Von Dechend participated at the first meeting of German anthropologists after WW II (Frankfurt/Main, 19th-21st September 1946).
Though her Doctorate was obtained in 1939 it was only 2 decades later that she obtained her Habilitation. She is listed as "Assistant, Institute for the History of Science, Frankfurt am Main, from 1943." In most ways it was a repeat of her work for Leo Frobenius at the at the "Research Institute of Cultural Morphology." Von Dechend completed/gained her Habilitation in 1960. The topic of her thesis was archaic science. She became a professor in 1960 and joined the faculty of the History of Natural Sciences in 1966. Her PhD dissertation (1939, Frankfurt University) was Die kultische und mythische Bedeutung des Schweins in Indonesien und Ozeanien. It remains unpublished. Her habilitation (1960, Frankfurt University) was Der Mythos von der gebauten Welt als Ausdrucksform archaiser Naturwissenschaft. It remains unpublished.
At a symposium in Frankfurt in 1958 she met Giorgio de Santillana (then Professor of the History of Science at MIT) and they became firm friends. At the invitation of de Santillana she spent a few months every year (for nearly a decade in the 1960s) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, USA.
In 1953 von Dechend's book on Justus von Liebig (and his contemporaries) was published. She was the editor of the book. It was her only major publication. It was republished (2nd edition?) in 1963. The Forward was written by Willy Hartner. In 1969 she published together with Giorgio de Santillana, Hamlet's Mill, An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time.
After the publication of Hamlet's Mill in 1969 and the death of Giorgio de Santillana in 1974 she continued to visit MIT and hold/teach seminars (on ancient cosmology). ("Introduction to Ancient Cosmology," 1976/1977 winter semester, MIT.)
Interestingly, Hertha von Dechend was a member of the International Astronomical Union sub-group, Inter-Union Commission for the History of Astronomy (ICHA).
In 1960 Hertha von Dechend was Professor of cultural morphology. (Morphology = the form or structure of any culture.) Her listings in academic directories (at later dates) include: (1) Fünfzig Jahre Habilitation von Frauen in Deutschland by Elisabeth Boedeker and Maria Meyer-Plath (1974) "Folk-Narrative Research ... 1966 Spezielles Lehrund Forshungsgebeit: Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften, Archaische Kosmologie und Astronomie." [= In 1966 she was appointed the title of extraordinary professor.] (2) Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte, Volumes 2-3, 1979 "Lehrgebiet: Frühgeschichte der Naturwissenschaft; Forschungsschwerpunkt: archaische Kosmologie." (3) Geschichte in Wissenschaft und Unterricht, [Volume 41, Issues 7-12, Page 634], 1990 "Gestchichte der Naturwissenschaften, Archaische Kosmologie." Several sources state/claim she was Professor of the History of Science at the University of Frankfurt. This is a mistaken shortening of "Gestchichte der Naturwissenschaften, Archaische Kosmologie."
According to Uta Lindgren, von Dechend's career in Frankfurt was unspectacular. Although she was, as was customary, appointed the title of professor 6 years from her Habilitation, it was not until 1971, 9 years before reaching retirement age, that she was given "Professor for Life" ("Professor auf Lebenszeit"). During this time von Dechend held each semester break from lectures, associated seminars when not engaged with such at MIT in the USA.
The German-language edition of Hamlet's Mill appeared in 1993. In 1977 she published an essay on the thunderbolt ("Bemerkungen zum Donnerkeil.") in: Prismata, Festschrift for Willy Hartner.
She retired from the University of Frankfurt am Main, becoming a Professor Emeritus (Archaische Kosmologie) in 1980?/1982. Hertha von Dechend retired in 1982 on a modest pension (enabled by her having secured a permanent teaching position with the university). Without the pension her retirement would have been rather precarious. After her retirement in 1980 she continued to hold seminars in private premises for a small group of about 8 participants. The location for these seminars was often the living room of the home of the Volhard family. It appears she



would also meet with Prof. Mayama in a room at IGN. Also, once a week she would travel from Kronberg to visit the library to receive material or to use materials from the library. These activities no doubt served a social function also - without them she would have been quite isolated in retirement.
Von Dechend died on 23 April 2001 (aged 86) at St. Mark's Hospital, Kronberg near Frankfurt am Main. Kronberg im Taunus is a town in the Hochtaunuskreis district, Hesse, Germany. Her funeral service was held on May 11, 2001. She continued to work until shortly before her death. Her address was Bahnhofstrasse 30, Kronberg, D-6242. (D-61476 given by one source is an error. Another citation of the her address for 1994 is Bohnhof Strasse #30, W6242, Kronberg.) Hertha von Dechend was a good friend of German internist Franz Volhard (1872-1950, a famous German specialist in internal medicine) and his extended family. She had worked as an assistant to his son Ewald Volhard at the Institute for Cultural Morphology. Due to her continued close relationship with the Volhard family she was buried in the Volhard family tomb. According to one source, following a memorial service at Frankfurt main cemetery, on 20 June an urn with her ashes was buried in the Volhard family tomb.

Richard Flavin (Hastro-L, 4 May 2001) wrote that later in May, von Dechend was scheduled to attend an informal conference at MIT. (His informant was Mrs Irene Reiche.) It would be interesting to have more details regarding the conference and its intended audience. Note: It appears that this was an error in understanding.
Abe Aronow always found Hertha von Dechend very charming (both at MIT and when visited decades later in Germany). Abe Aronow also relates that, to the best of his recall, he never heard anybody use her first name in conversation, and Giorgio always addressed her as Dechend. According to Abe Aronow: "She was a "sie" not a "du" person."
It is indicated she had certain spiritual values but these are unclear.
Obviously she was fluent in several languages (including English and French). Regarding her knowledge of languages, Abe Aronow states: "I'm sure she was fluent in French, probably required in German scholarship. She was very comfortable in English and probably more precise than her students. I have to believe she knew Italian enough to carry on conversations. I remember Giorgio speaking on the phone in mellifluous Italian and she seemed comfortable in following his end. She was trained in Greek, Latin and some Hebrew and had working knowledge of ... [other languages]."
For details concerning von Dechend as an ethnologist see Frauen in der deutschsprachigen Ethnologie: ein Handbuch (2007) by Bettina Beer. It contains brief details of the other 2 female ethnologists (Hildegard Klein (1904-1989, PhD, an excellent ethnologist and scholar) and Karin [Hahn-]Hissink (1907-1981), PhD, who participated in ethnological expeditions) employed at the Frobenius-Institute, and conflicts. Also see: Leo Frobenius, anthropologue, explorateur, aventurierle monde étranger, c'est moi (1999) by Hans-Jürgen Heinrichs, for further brief details of Hertha von Dechend.
According to Wikipedia (26/1/2013): "Von Dechend is best known for her collaborative work on Hamlet’s Mill: an Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time, co-authored with Giorgio de Santillana, an Italian-American philosopher and historian of science on the faculty at MIT. Hamlet's Mill is a study of history, mythology, and specifically archaeoastronomy. [The claim the Hamlet's Mill is linked to archaeoastronomy is interesting. In one of his articles Roopa H. Naragan has stated that investigating knowledge of astronomy in mythology is part of the discipline of archaeoastronomy.] Von Dechend's contribution was to connect astronomical phenomena to the myths that they represented and to clear up historical misinterpretations of those myths." This is simply sympathetic (biased) and inaccurate. Close to the truth is the comment by one writer that Hertha von Dechend "... spent her life reinterpreting ancient stories as a kind of scientific shorthand for astronomical events." Her principal fields of research were archaic cosmology and astronomy. Hamlet's Mill is not archaeoastronomy. It is speculation. The historian Carroll Quigley referred to Hamlet's Mill as linguistic archaeology.
Von Dechend published two papers on archaic cosmology: "Il concetto di simmetria nelle culture arcaiche." (La Simmetria, a cura di Evandro Agazzi (1973) / (La Simmetria edited by Evandro Agnazzi (1973, Pages 361-399, includes Discussione) and "Bemerkungen zum Donnerkeil." ("Comments on the Thunderbolt.") In: Festschrift Willy Hartner (1977). Von Dechend also undertook research on the work of Justus von Liebig, a well-known organic chemist, publishing a review of letters between Liebig and chemist Friedrich Wöhler of Göttingen. Her slim book (in which her role was that of an editor) on Justus von Liebig (published 1953, 2nd edition 1963) basically consists of her annotations to key excerpts from letters, journals and newspaper articles (chronologically arranged) concerning important events involving Justus von Liebig; and a bibliography of 369 publications. One (English-language) book review (by Ralph Oesper, University of Cincinnati, Ohio) appeared in the Journal of Chemical Education, Volume 41, Number 10, October, 1964. His concluding remark is: "This is an unusually interesting book." Unpublished works include her doctoral dissertation and her Habilitationsschrift (a postdoctoral thesis required for qualification as a professor), but the resources that she used to complete them still exist.
An unpublished manuscript is, Phenomena of High Noon by Hertha von Dechend (circa 2000?). I think it was in this manuscript that the midday viewing of stars was explored. It has been commented in the past that the ability and importance of 'seeing' stars during the day is in dire need of discussion.
One academic listing for her simply states: Dr. Hertha von Dechend; Prof. h.c. Dr. mult.
Von Dechend was academically connected (joint publications) with Walter Wetzel, Wolfgang Trageser, Walter Saltzer, and Claus Nissen. Her voluminous correspondence is kept at the Frobenius-Institute.
I have yet to sight the small Hertha von Dechend Memorial Volume that was published shortly after her death.
Note: A lengthy obituary ("The Woman Who Wondered") for Hertha von Dechend was written by Richard Flavin and posted at his Flavin's Corner (http://www.flavinscorner.com) as his weekly column for May 4, 2001. It is full of eulogistic praise for her efforts. In writing it he was helped by Irene Reiche and Emma Duchane sharing their memories with him of von Dechend. This makes it valuable as a source of information. The obituary is supportive of the work and ideas of Hertha von Dechend and Hamlet's Mill. Unfortunately, some details are absent and some of the details and observations appear to be incorrect.
Points: (1) It can hardly be claimed that Hamlet's Mill is appreciated for its multi-disciplinary sincerity by nearly everyone. It is largely a philological argument rather than multi-disciplinary. The redundant nature of the main methodology has not appreciated by other specialists.



Interestingly, the St. Thomas University, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, Curriculum Committee Report to Senate, November 2010, a course proposal document, included Hamlet's Mill (1969) in the proposed Morgan Sound Course Bibliography. (2) It is not stated for how long Hertha von Dechend studied under Leo Frobenius at the University of Frankfurt. As her PhD was awarded in 1939 a 1936/1937 enrolment is indicated (making her enrolment age around 18 years). The Abiturzeugnis obtained by von Dechend in the 1930s was the General Certificate of Education (advanced level), and a university entrance qualification. It appears to have been sufficient qualification for entry to doctoral level studies (and not simply an undergraduate degree). In 1932 Frobenius was appointed Honorary Professor at Frankfurt University. He died on 9 August 1938. (3) Von Dechend concentrated most of her efforts in the study and teaching of the history of science. This generalised statement obscures career details and makes a 'time jump' of some 2 decades. It is obvious she did not pursue a career in archaeology or ethnology. However, it is indicated that it was only through particular circumstances (such as her friendship with Willy Hartner, who also had been associated with Frobenius) that she became associated with the history of science. The reality is her principal fields of research were what she believed was archaic cosmology and astronomy - and her method was speculation in the form of 'linguistic archaeology.' (4) The significant influence of Leo Frobenius on Hertha von Dechend is no mere allegation attempting to diminish her "bold accomplishments," nor does it comprise an attack. There is abundant evidence that the ideas of Frobenius, German-Austrian diffusionism, and Panbabylonism were significant influences, and that von Dechend took significant ideas from all three. Her scheme of interpreting world mythology was certainly not original. (5) The significance of Leo Frobenius for ethnology has diminished over time. That he is still cited with caution is nothing unusual. (6) The direction and method of von Dechend's work was not entirely her own. She was a hyper-diffusionist and Panbabylonist, and employed their methods. Within the British school of Pan-Egyptian hyperdiffusionism, J[ames] Rendel Harris (1852-1941, Biblical scholar and curator and amateur archaeologist/anthropologist) published numerous essay series (Caravan essays, Evergreen essays, Sunset essays, The After-glow essays, Woodbroke essays) during the 1920s and early 1930s, using "philological archaeology" that included his supposed identification of ancient traces of Egyptian language and culture around the world (but especially in Western Europe). As example: Traces of Ancient Egypt in the Mediterranean, Volume 1 of the Woodbroke essays (1927, 23 Pages). The possible influence of this approach on von Dechend (who was an enthusiastic supporter of the British Pan-Egyptian school) has not been examined. (6) It is not entirely correct to state that her major publications were few in number. Her Phd thesis remains unpublished. I have never seen her PhD thesis referred to in professional (or any) studies. Von Dechend's PhD thesis is not included in, The Importance of the Pig in Pacific Island Culture: An Annotated Bibliography (Secretariat of the Pacific Community, 2007, 45 pages). Hamlet's Mill was not a major publication and was co-authored with Giorgio de Santillana. She never really moved away from the original 1969 format with the later 1993 German-language edition. Her only major publication was the short book (2 editions (1953, 1963), 158 pages), Justus von Liebig in eigenen Zeugnissen und solchen seiner Zeitgenossen. It is basically an anthology of snippets from his letters and a detailed bibliography of his publications. She was the editor. Much of the material had been published before. Liebig (1803-1873) was an important figure in the history of chemistry (the greatest chemist of his time) but had attracted little attention from historians. See the (English-language) book review by Henry Leicester in Isis, Volume 55, Number 3, September 1964, Pages 396. There is no reason to believe she was considering any similar publication when de Santillana met her in Frankfurt in 1959. Certainly, her short book on Justus von Liebig was not expanded into a detailed biographical study. See also: "Liebigiana: Old and New Perspectives." by W. H. Brock in History of Science, Volume 19, Number 3, 1981, Pages 201-218. (7) The construction that de Santillana "whisked" von Dechend away to MIT in 1965 to lecture whilst Willy Hartner, her colleague at IGN, wrote his "classic" paper, "The Earliest History of the Constellations in the Near East and the Motif of the Lion-Bull Combat" is somewhat fictional. The details of the terms of von Dechend's 'engagement' at MIT - beginning in the early 1960s - and her interaction with students, remains to be clarified. To suggest she was a 'mainstream' lecturer with her own autonomy and not subsumed within the teaching and other activities of de Santillana (and later Reiche, after de Santillana's death) is indicated as misleading. Von Dechend was established as a research associate circa 1961 at MIT, and would spend part of the year (basically end of year) at MIT. (I have only seen the current (2016) MIT Policy for Academic Research Staff Appointments. Sighting a copy of the one for the early 1960s would be informative.) Her lectures were to Humanities students at short seminars held in the evening as part of the Independent Activities Period. Hartner's paper was largely speculative and has failed to be influential. (8) The contention that persons who dismiss Hamlet's Mill are "small-minded individuals," who are intimidated by the sheer scope of their central thesis is without validity. The book's central thesis simply mirrors the tenets of Panbabylonism. The manifold problems with Panbabylonism were critiques without difficulty. My essay on Panbabylonism comprises a comprehensive critique. A reasonable "rule of thumb" is the judgement that the burden of proof lies with the proponent of the claim being asserted. Critics of Hamlet's Mill have pointed out fundamental problems that go to the core of the methodology used and the reliability of the claims being made. As far as I am aware this particular essay is the most detailed critique. (9) It has not been unrealistic to have expectations for further commentary and proof. The presentation of the "central thesis" of Hamlet's Mill has been left muddled and obscure by the authors. That von Dechend, a university professor, cannot - or cannot be bothered - to rectify the situation and clarify the argument (along with the so-called proof) is simply unacceptable for a supposedly scholarly work. It is also impossible to make a concise summary/assessment of each book chapter regarding the main argument. To claim that a concise assessment could never be fair - without explaining why - is puzzling. (10) To claim that both authors of Hamlet's Mill would have wanted students to think for themselves is irrelevant to the muddled content presentation. The MIT course notes, Introduction to Ancient Cosmology by Hertha von Dechend, issued in 1966, also enables some insight. The introductory comments strongly imply the course had also been presented 1964-1965. Also, these are new course notes with a different approach to presenting the material, to enable better understanding by students of the theme being promoted. It appears that from 1961 to 1965 Humanities students undertaking the "Ancient Cosmology" module were experiencing difficulty in comprehending the ideas being promoted. Astoundingly, over a span of 4 decades, this situation could not be fixed by either of the authors! Hamlet's Mill was 'cobbled' together over more than a decade before being first published. Von Dechend had not made the attempt to establish a clear text. De Santillana came late to the task of preparing a manuscript for publication. (11) Von Dechend's supposed "bold accomplishments" are mostly derivative - sourced from Leo Frobenius, hyperdiffusionism, and Panbabylonism.
Ethnology at a distance
Von Dechend's PhD work is an example of "armchair" ethnology; an example of "ethnology at a distance." (This was typical for the time with some ethnologists.) At no time for her PhD, Habilitation, or work on the Hamlet's Mill project was she a fieldworker. Her PhD thesis was begun prior to WWII and completed during the very early period of WWII. She did not visit the Pacific region and she was not able to ensure she gathered quality empirical data. It is doubtful that it comprises an important explanatory guide. By the 1940s, ethnologists/anthropologists conducted research through participant observation and long-term residence with their informants, a methodology known as ethnographic fieldwork. How von Dechend compensated for this significant methodological limitation is presently not known to me. The problem appears to have been overlooked in any comments on her PhD thesis. Whether von Dechend reach flawed conclusions also appears to have been overlooked. For a study of the types of problems/difficulties see the 2004 critique by Sonia Ryang of Ruth Benedict's mid 1940s work - involving empirical and interpretive errors - on Japanese culture (The Chrysanthemum and the Sword by Sonia [sometimes erroneously, Sonja] Ryang (2004)).

When she was 19 years old, von Dechend began informal studies - and worked - at the Museum für Völkerkunde in Frankfurt = In 1934, without having a study permit, von Dechend found a safe place at the municipal Museum of Ethnology in Frankfurt. Initially, von Dechend lacked permission to study (Studienerlaubnis), but managed to obtain a certificate (Abiturzeugnis). Leo Frobenius had been appointed museum director in 1932. The museum was directed by Leo Frobenius until his death in 1938. She participated in the production of the magazine and the organisation of the artifacts. Since 2001 it has been known as the Museum der Weltkulturen (Museum of World Cultures). There are no details regarding whether paid work or unpaid volunteer work.

PhD student
After performing her obligatory national service (Arbeitsdienst), she enrolled at the University of Frankfurt am Main (the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University) where she studied ethnology, philosophy, and archaeology. She majored in archaeology and ethnology. She still remained working at the Research Institute of Cultural Morphology (Forschungsinstitut für Kulturmorphologie) in Frankfurt, managing the private library of Leo Frobenius until his death in 1938. After his death she remained working there. In 1925 the Forschungsinstitut für Kulturmorphologie was moved to Frankfurt am Main, where it was attached to the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, where Frobenius was appointed to a lectureship in culture and ethnology. In 1934 Frobenius also became director of Frankfurt's Museum of Anthropology (Museum für Völkerkunde).

completion of PhD
She completed her doctoral thesis in 1939, during early WWII, and obtained her doctorate with a thesis on an ethnological subject. The topic was: Die kultische und mythische Bedeutung des Schweins in Indonesien und Ozeanien. [The ritual and mythical significance of the pig in Indonesia and Oceania.] (It remains unpublished.) From 1939 (obviously after completing her PhD) to 1945 von Dechend is listed in the Frobenius Institute records as an associate fellow. (One source states her position of research assistant from 1939 to 1946 was "half-time." The Frobenius Institut lists her as an Associate Researcher (wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin) from 1939-1945.) According to Schipper, Björn. (2006). "Verzeichnis der Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter des FrobeniusInstituts." In: Kohl, Karl-Heinz. and Platte, Editha. (Editors). Gestalter und Gestalten - 100 Jahre Ethnologie in Frankfurt am Main. (Pages 241256); Hertha von Dechend was a research assistant from 1939 to 1946 (wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin). The current (2015) webpage for the Frobenius-Institut an der Goethe-Universität - Frankfurt am Main, gives the following summary information about Hertha von Dechend: "Ethnologist and archaeological astronomer. High-school teacher at the Institut für Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften, Frankfurt/M. (19431980) . Extent and type of legacy: about forty removal boxes.

(One source states she graduated in 1943 in Frankfurt and afterwards was employed at the Institute for the History of Natural Sciences. The graduation date is erroneous for her PhD.) The webpage of the Frobenius-Institut records: "Ethnologist and archaeological astronomer. High-school teacher at the Institut für Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften, Frankfurt/M. (19431980).") Note: The term "archaeoastronomer" is really only a pseudo academic term. Besides, she was not by training and/or experience an archaeologist or an astronomer. According to some sources she was only from November 1943 temporarily at IGN. In 1943, she held a half-time position at the Institute for the History of Science in Johann Goethe University (now the University of Frankfurt am Main). It appears she played an integral part in running the university when Willy Hartner, the founder of the Institute for the History of Natural Sciences, was on leave at Harvard. She was also instrumental in building the university's library. In 1943 Willy Hartner succeeded in establishing an Institute for the History of Science in Frankfurt, which was later (the IGN itself was closed (merged) in 2009) incorporated into the Department of Physics. At the establishment of the Institute he engaged her (beginning November) as a secretary, librarian and (personal?) assistant.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA
1960-1969 (but beginning1961)
Research Associate 1960-1969 regular research and teaching visits to the MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts were for 2 months duration each visiting year. First visit to MIT in 1961 as a research associate. Arranged through de Santillana. During her visits as a Research Associate she became involved with de Santillana's "project group," and student seminars on ancient cosmology, and Jerome Lettvin's so-called Experimental Epistemology Laboratory. In summary, she attended MIT regularly for 3 reasons: (1) Her involvement with projects at the Neurophysiology Research Group (Neurophysiology Laboratory), (2) her involvement with de Santillana and his Humanities students in the Hamlet's Mill research project, and (3) presenting seminars (in conjunction with other MIT staff) on Ancient Cosmology. Note: De Santillana's advice enabled Hertha von Dechend to receive a Sloan Foundation grant for post-graduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he lectured. He also assisted her to become a research associate (within the Humanities Department) at MIT. (Within a university the title research associate is given to post-doctorates who are conducting post-doctoral research. Hertha von Dechend's research would have been leading towards the book Hamlet's Mill.) It would also appear that Hertha von Dechend remained a research associate at MIT throughout the 1960s and between 1960 and 1969 either stayed in the USA or made regular (annual) lengthy research and teaching visits to MIT. During this period, with leave-of-absence from Frankfurt University, she apparently resided in the USA for at least a considerable number of years on one visit. Some sources hold she resided in the USA from 1960 to 1969. (Yet another source suggests she was a research associate at MIT for 5 winters from 1962 to 1967. Who's Who in Germany 1990 (Part 1, Page 254) states von Dechend "Spent 6 winter terms in visiting capacity at MIT." This is likely accurate. For 5 years from 1962 to 1967 von Dechend was associated with one of the research laboratories at MIT. It appears de Santillana was for many years also associated with a research laboratory at MIT. (See: La Fondation du monde by Michael Demion (2011, Page 263.) This was obviously the Neurophysiology Laboratory. The Neurophysiology Research Group (Neurophysiology Laboratory) was formed within the Research Laboratory of Electronics. Its concept was an extension of the Research Laboratory of Electronics (and its investigations used Research Laboratory of Electronics equipment). Both the Research Laboratory of



Electronics and the Neurophysiology Research Group were located in Building 20.) The most reliable source states that 1960-1969 she made regular research and teaching visits to MIT. (This period was her only break with her otherwise continuous employment, since November 1943, at the Institut für Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität, in Germany (founded by Willy Hartner).) In 1969 she returned to the University of Frankfort and her post as Professor of the History of Science (and Emeritius from 1980). (The Wikipedia article on Hamlet's Mill (January, 2010) erroneously identifies her as a scientist.)) (According to one source at the Institut für Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften her regular research and teaching visits to MIT spanned 1960-1969. According to another source she was a research associate at MIT for five winters spanning, 1962-1967. Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, is now perhaps the best guide. Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, Volumes 16-17, 1963, Page 458, has Hertha von Dechend as: Priv.-Doz. (Privatdozent (= holding all formal qualifications (both doctorate and habilitation) [unsalaried lecturer if a formal position not held?]) researching at MIT for winter semester 1964/1965 (... wird im WS 1964/65 zu Forschungszwecken am Massachusetts Institute of Technology ....). According to Who's who in Germany 1990: Part 1, A-L, Page 254: "Dechend ... spent six winter terms in visiting capacity at MIT, Cambridge, Mass., USA. 1960-1967 ...." (Once again, other sources give 1960-1969.) (See also: (MIT) Technology Review, Volume 62, 1960, Page 76, for mention of "Herta von Dechend, Germany, protohistoric material of myths and legend ...." ) It is not evidence from MIT reports (i.e., Report of the President and the Chancellor) I have so far seen that von Dechend was there in 1967.

Von Dechend's eventual title was "Professor of History of Science, Ancient Cosmology," likely based on her supposed knowledge of precessional mythology. She had no wide knowledge/expertise on the history of science.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA
1970s Visiting Professor After the publication of Hamlet's Mill in 1969 and the death of Giorgio de Santillana in 1974 she continued to visit MIT and hold/teach seminars (on ancient cosmology). ("Introduction to Ancient Cosmology," 1976/1977 winter semester, MIT.) In, Report of the President and the



Chancellor 1978-79 Massachusetts Institute of Technology (page 35)
under Visiting Faculty, Visiting Professors, (Personnel Changes) appears: "Hertha von Dechend Program in Science, Technology, and Society." Note: Two categories are applicable to Hertha von Dechend at MIT. Firstly, "research associate" (the designation that applied to her during the 1960s); secondly, "visiting professor" (which applied to her during the 1970s). Basically, (present-day) a research assistant at MIT is a member of a research group in a Laboratory or Project who works closely with a faculty supervisor and with other graduate students on a sponsored research project. In the current (2016) MIT policy on research appointments the category "senior research associate" (Academic Research Staff Appointments, Section 5.3) is included, but this is not relevant to von Dechend. For leads to relevant sources for early MIT policies and procedures (i.e., 1960s) see: Academia's Golden Age:

1980 Emeritus
Emeritus since 1980. She retired from the University of Frankfurt am Main, becoming a Professor Emeritus (Archaische Kosmologie) in 1980?/1982. Hertha von Dechend retired in 1982 on a modest pension (enabled by her having secured a permanent teaching position with the university). Without the pension her retirement would have been rather precarious. After her retirement in 1980 she continued to hold seminars in private premises for a small group of about 8 participants. The location for these seminars was often the living room of the home of the Volhard family. It appears she would also meet with Prof. Mayama in a room at IGN. Also, once a week she would travel from Kronberg to visit the library to receive material or to use materials from the library.
Achievements of von Dechend as professor at IGN
According to Uta Lindgren, von Dechend's career in Frankfurt was unspectacular. From at least 1979 von Dechend had the title of Professor of History of Science, Ancient Cosmology. Willy Hartner was still alive (he died 16 May 1981) with the title of Professor Emeritus of the History of Science. It would be interesting to know if he had been influential in the establishment of von Dechend's professorship title. It is an interesting comment but it is not elaborated by Lindgren. One wonders if von Dechend's teaching methods played a part in this. She was a trenchant proponent of her ideas. If she repeated her MIT style of lecturing at IGN then I think student difficulties in understanding her ideas would have resulted. I have never seen any information regarding hours a week she lectured for. I envisage approximately 10-12 hours per week.
Von Dechend, once she had decided on an astronomical interpretation/explanation of world mythology, proceeded to take many key ideas from Panbabylonism and created a complex fantasy. After being given a teaching platform at MIT for over a decade, beginning in 1961 - even though not appointed to the title of professor at IGN until 1966 - and then becoming Professor of Archaic Cosmology at IGN for some 2 decades, she achieved virtually nothing (i.e., student accomplishments) and established nothing permanent (i.e., the position of Professor of Archaic Cosmology is defunct), and made no impact on the academic study of mythology (i.e., there is no academic acceptance of her ideas). This has no impact on uninformed proponents/devotees of Hamlet's Mill who simply opine "There will always be people who understand nothing." They miss the point that this applies to themselves. Their good impressions of the book are supported by there own ignorance of the issues.
Questions can be divided into 2 sets. Set 1: (1) How was von Dechend's title of "Professor of History of Science, Ancient Cosmology" established? (2) By whom was it established and why? (3) What were the teaching expectations for this title? (4) Was there a period of some independence in the teaching structure at IGN? (5) Why was she not succeeded by another person holding the same title? (To some extent she was succeeded by Walter Saltzer.) Set 2: (1) Who were her students at IGN? Did she have any doctoral students at IGN? (2) Did any student at IGN produce a doctoral thesis on "archaic cosmology"? A source of information may be: "Erinnerungen an die Frühzeit des Instituts." [Memories of the Institute's early days] by Hertha von Dechend (Pages 3-12(13?), part of: "Das Institut in Eigener Sache" [The Institute in its own right]) In: Ad Radices: Festband zum fünfzigjährigen Bestehen des Instituts für Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften der Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main [The Roots: Festive book on the fiftieth anniversary of the Institute for the History of Natural Sciences at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main] edited by Anton von Gotstedter (1994). I have not seen it indicated that von Dechend had any PhD students. It appears that at IGN von Dechend produced no graduate students. (The question is: Was IGN a research institution?) I have not seen it indicated that any doctorial thesis originated from von Dechend as a supervisor, especially any on "archaic cosmology." No details of her courses or students seem readily available. A source of information is: "Promotionen zum Dr. phil. nat. am IGN 1943-1993." (Pages 29-34), In: Ad

Yearbook details (page 16) of colloquium (academic conference/seminar) for Hertha von Dechend. No conference publication seems to have resulted.
Von Dechend's relationship with the Volhard family
In 1939 von Dechend was recognised as a tireless assistant of Ewald Volhard (a son of the famous internist and nephropolgist Franz Volhard), at the Institute for Cultural Morphology. (See: "Geleitwort des Herrausgebers" in Kannibalismus by Ewald Volhard (1939).) Ewald Volhard (19001945) was a German ethnologist. Volhard studied German Literature in Halle, where he received his PhD in 1927. In 1933 he became assistant at the Institute for Cultural Morphology (today: Frobenius-Institut) at Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität in Frankfurt a.M. During the 1930s he participated in several research expeditions of the D.I.A.F.E. (including Transjordan and Libyan desert, Southern France and Eastern Iberia). Volhard was considered to be one of Frobenius' 'crown princes.' His habilitation thesis Kannibalismus (University of Berlin) was completed in 1939 and published. It was an extensive study on the worldwide practices of cannibalism. During WWII, Volhard served in the German army as a soldier and was killed in February 1945, in the battle for Cleves. Volhards family remained cordially related with the Frobenius-Institute. Volhard’s



obituary article "Leo Frobenius." (Paideuma, Volume 1, 1938, Pages 41-44) mentions Hertha von Dechend. An obituary of Ewald Volhard written by A E. Jensen was published in Paideuma 3, Volumes 3-5, October 1948, Pages 191-193. The Frobenius Institute in Frankfurt continued the work of Leo Frobenius through the magazine "Paideuma," edited from 1946 to ? by A. Jensen, a scholar of Indonesian and African peoples. For von Dechend's continuing association with the Frobenius Institute see the uncritical biography, Leo Frobenius, anthropologue, explorateur, adventurier by Hans-Jurgen Heinrichs (1999).
It appears von Dechend contributed to Paideuma. It is indicated she contributed to: Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde, Volumes 36-37, 1990. On page 361: "Prof. Dr. Hertha von Dechend, Kronberg im Taunus." Contributors are listed as: Universität Frankfurt am Main. FrobeniusInstitut, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kulturmorphologie, Frobenius-Gesellschaft.
Hertha von Dechend as an ethnologist
She was not a fieldworker. She basically worked from secondary sources. She was a hyperdiffusionist. The results of modern archaeology give no support to this position as a suitable explanation of culture.
Von Dechend believed the so-called Bushmen of the Kalahari (San or Basarwa) are the best witnesses of the earliest known culture of homo sapiens. (Introduction to Cosmology (1979).) The San/Basarwa are the original modern inhabitants of southern Africa. For over half a century scholars have argued there is a cultural continuity between the San/Basarwa and African peoples living 30,000 or 40,000 years ago. (See: Anthropology and the Bushman by Alan Barnard (2007).)
Hertha von Dechend's influence on Giorgio de Santillana
There is little doubt that de Santillana's existing beliefs concerning the origins of intelligence and early science predisposed him to readily accepting von Dechend's ideas. De Santillana was keen to introduce revolutionary ideas, such as an early (Neolithic period) date for the establishment of scientific (astronomical) knowledge, into the history of science. Manfred Pokert, The theoretical foundations of Chinese medicine (1974), Page xi, mentions a seminar of Giorgio de Santillana's in existentialism which was centred on the beginnings of scientific thought.
The scope of the Hamlet’s Mill project
The Hamlet’s Mill project was more inclusive than just comparative mythology or a claim for cosmological mythology. It embodied a theory of human development. It was an attempt to sustain the view that ancient people were: (1) capable of meticulous and accurate astronomical observations, and (2) were capable of complex thought. The authors of Hamlet’s Mill advocated an early and advanced lost civilization (possessing at least a sophisticated but now lost astronomical knowledge). This particular lost civilization originated a single archaic system comprising an astronomical monomyth that prevailed throughout most of the civilized and proto-civilised world from circa at least 4000 BCE to circa 100 CE. The supposed monomyth is reflected in mythical, legendary, and historical narratives world-wide. For the authors and supporters of the book these assertions remain correct for all time. All of this is pure fantasy. Supportive archaeological evidence by way of possible astronomical and mathematical features of the design of ancient monuments is not forthcoming.
De Santillana did not view cultural history as a process of gradual evolution. Rather he regarded civilisation had appeared quite suddenly. See: Hamlet's Mill, Pages 69-71.
Modern ideas on the origin of intelligence
Supporters of Hamlet’s Mill almost uniformly claim that 'academic experts' are convinced a priori of the scientific ignorance of our presumed 'savage' prehistoric ancestors. Though Paleolithic people were the first modern humans in the evolutionary sense, they were viewed during the pioneering period of anthropology brutish hunter-gatherers largely incapable of advanced thinking (i.e., record keeping). However, almost uniformly, no modern 'academic experts' support the viewpoint of the scientific ignorance of, and savage nature of, Palaeolithic and Neolithic people. The assertion seems to originate from the discarded early ethnological theories of pioneers such as the 19th-century British researcher Edward Tylor (privately educated, self-trained, pioneering anthropologist). Major works authored by Tylor include: Researches into the Early History of Mankind (1865), Primitive Culture (2 Volumes, 1871), and Anthropology (1881). Also, James Frazer, the Scottish social anthropologist and author of The Golden Bough (3rd edition: 12 volumes, 1906–1915; 1936), generally followed Tylor's ideas. Interestingly, Tylor believed that cultural resemblances revealed processes of diffusion. He proposed the axiom: The more sophisticated an innovation, the more likely it originated in diffusion. (Frazer's mentor was Robertson Smith.)
There is no convincing reason to believe that modern language (and associated sophistication in human thought) arose in Europe at the end of last Ice Age. "As an archaeologist I find it unreasonable to demand archaeological proof of modern consciousness and modern thought processes in order to accept the notion of modern language forms at an earlier time." (Early Humans and Their World by Bo Gräslund (2005, Pages 110).) Archaeological finds (such as tools and weapons made with an evident degree of high technical precision) suggests that this capacity for modern language is far earlier than the end of the last Ice Age.
Modern humans have been around for for approximately 200,000 years. Modern humans who colonised the earth in the past 100,000 years had intellectual abilities and cultural sophistication similar to present-day people. Di Santillana and von Dechend are likely correct in stating (Hamlet's Mill, Page 71): "Mistaking cultural history for a process of gradual evolution, we have deprived ourselves of every reasonable insight into the nature of culture." Cultural development can proceed with great rapidity. There has been episodes of rapid cultural development in the recent past. Cultural evolution occurs faster than genetic change. The origin and spread of agriculture was a key trigger. Vastly larger population were able to be supported by agriculture than by hunting and gathering.
A comprehensive and more recent approach to the prehistory of human intelligence and the origin of science than that undertaken by Giorgio de Santillana is: The Prehistory of the Mind by Steven Mithen (1996). Steven Mithen has a BA (hons) in Prehistory & Archaeology from Sheffield University, an MSc in Biological Computation from York University and a PhD in Archaeology from Cambridge University. Between 1987 and 1992 he was a Research Fellow at Trinity Hall and then Lecturer in Archaeology at Cambridge. After moving to the University of Reading, he was promoted to Senior Lecturer (1996), Reader (1998) and then Professor of Early Prehistory (2000). In August 2002 he was appointed as the first Head of the School of Human & Environmental Sciences, formed by the Departments of Archaeology, Geography, Soil Science and the Postgraduate Institute of Sedimentology, a post he held until August 2008 when be became Dean of the Faculty of Science. He was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy in 2004. See also the modern discussion: "The Evolution of Intelligence" by Liane Gabora and Anne Russon. in: The Cambridge Handbook of Intelligence edited by Robert Sternberg and Scott Kaufman (2011, Pages 328-350).
Recent archaeological work is establishing the early use of symbols of a linguistic nature. There is recent (clear) evidence for early visual symbol systems that were not writing but did comprise a highly developed symbolic literacy, and demonstrate early imaging and abstracting capacities.



Evolutionary forces are open-ended. Evolutionary development in humans took the form of great intelligence. The evolutionary development of bigger and better brains in humans resulted in the increasing capacity for cleverness. The human brain became a 'learning machine.'
There was more than one "Out of Africa" dispersal of hominids. (It is also argued that there were also some dispersals into Africa during the early Pleistocene period by some human species.) By the late 20th-century a combination of genetic and paleontological techniques allowed scientists to confirm that our own peculiar species originated in Africa. Anatomically-modern representatives of Homo Sapiens originated in Africa about 200,000 years ago, and populations of our species began to disperse out of Equatorial East Africa by circa 70,000 years BCE. Much remains to be discovered about human evolution during the past 500,000 years. Modern evidence indicates that multiple human lineages left Africa and dispersed throughout Europe and Asia. A combination of fossil and genetic data has given significant support to the theory that many of these disparate populations interbred with each other. The earliest remains of modern humans in Europe date to circa 45,000 BCE. The single skullcap (dated circa 55,000 BCE) evidence from the Manot Cave (discovered 2008) in northern Israel indicates that humans left their evolutionary cradle in Africa and passed through the Middle East on their way to Europe. Prehistoric humans left Africa far earlier than circa 70,000 BCE but these migratory populations appear to have eventually become extinct. (Circa at least 250,000 BCE small groups of Homo heidelbergensis, an early human species, migrated across Africa and into Europe. Neanderthal and modern human lineages diverged from a common ancestor circa 270,000 BCE to circa 440,000 BCE. Neanderthals were a population that rose circa 150,000 BCE and persisted in parts of Europe until circa 25,000 BCE.) Note: Recently discovered (from 1961 onwards) human fossils from the Jebel Irhoud site in Morocco may have added 100 000 years to the history of homo sapiens. The interpretation of the fossils finds is still controversial.
At the Qafzeh cave in Israel ochre was used by hominins there circa 80,000 BCE. (Hominins = members of the human clade/species (all the evolutionary descendants of a common ancestor).) The recently found Qesem Cave teeth (4 of) in Israel and the identification and origin of the Quesem Cave humans remains unclear. The teeth are presently dated to circa 300,000 BCE.
Genetic studies relating to the evolution of Homo sapiens are summarised in "A new view of the birth of Homo sapiens." by A. Gibbons (Science, Volume 31, Pages 392-394). The ancestors of modern humans emerged in Africa circa 200,000 years BCE. Some migrated from Africa. Later, Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa several times in the past circa 100,000 years BCE. A substantial dispersal of Homo sapiens occurred circa 50,000 BCE. Homo sapiens interbred with Neanderthals and also with Denisovans in Asia. (Denisova hominin is an extinct species of human in the genus Homo that lived in eastern Eurasia.)
The enormous amount of stunning artwork in the Paleolithic European caves of France and Spain indicate a fully formed modern intelligence. The evolutionary breakthrough had been thought to occur in Europe circa 40,000 BCE. The Chauvet caves in France have artwork dated to circa 30,000 BCE; the Grotte du Renne has Neanderthal ornaments (including perforated teeth presumably worn as a necklace) dating to circa 40,000 BCE; and the El Castillo cave in Spain has potentially Neanderthal cave paintings dating to circa 40,000 BCE. However, it has been thought that the non European predecessors of these Paleolithic cave artists lacked the capacity for any kind of abstract or symbolic thought.
A series of recent art and artefact finds in the Blombos cave and Diepkloof rock shelter in South Africa have provided evidence that our common ancestors had developed the capacity for abstract and symbolic thought prior to leaving Africa. Circa 70,000 BCE the homo sapiens comprising the small coastal cave communities of South Africa show evidence of rapid intellectual development (the clues comprise the attainment of symbolic thinking). The evidence at Blombos Cave comprises the decoration of small hematite nodules with geometric designs (cross-hatchings). (Hematite is a type of iron rock.) (The use of pigment in the Blombos cave is dated to circa 100,000 BCE.) In the Diepkloof rock shelter (a South African cave complex) almost 300 fragments of ostrich egg shells decorated with precise cross-hatched designs have been found, dating to circa 60,000 BCE. According to one source, the Diepkloof rock shelter artefacts comprising ostrich shells engraved with 5 geometric patterns are dated to circa 50,000 (perhaps 60,000) BCE. This may indicate that the earlier Blombos Cave cross-hatchings actually have meaning. Collections of seashells in the Qafzeh cave in Israel, and in the Grotte des Pigeons in Morocco provide evidence that modern humans were collecting these for personal ornaments circa 80,000 BCE. It is expected that further work will show that the origins of human cognition is complicated - not simple. The examination of geometric symbols on artefacts and cave walls suggests perhaps their use as clan and territorial markers. (See: "The Origins of Intelligence." by Alison George (NewScientist, 23 November, 2013, Number 2944, Pages 36-40).)
The results (2016) of the most recent DNA research/genetic analysis - involving samples collected from cultures around the globe - is the evidence suggests that the ancestry of all non-Africans can be traced back to a single population migration out of Africa between 50,000 and 80,000 years ago. Modern humans evolved in Africa approximately 200,000 years ago.
Hertha von Dechend at MIT
De Santillana's advice enabled Hertha von Dechend to receive a Sloan Foundation grant for post-graduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he lectured. He also assisted her to become a research associate (within the Humanities Department) at MIT. (Within a university the title research associate is given to post-doctorates who are conducting post-doctoral research. Hertha von Dechend's research would have been leading towards the book Hamlet's Mill.) It would also appear that Hertha von Dechend remained a research associate at MIT throughout the 1960s and between 1960 and 1969 either stayed in the USA or made regular (annual) lengthy research and teaching visits to MIT. During this period, with leave-of-absence from Frankfurt University, she apparently resided in the USA for at least a considerable number of years on one visit. Some sources hold she resided in the USA from 1960 to 1969. (Yet another source suggests she was a research associate at MIT for 5 winters from 1962 to 1967. Who's Who in Germany 1990 (Part 1, Page 254) states von Dechend "Spent 6 winter terms in visiting capacity at MIT." This is likely accurate. For 5 years from 1962 to 1967 von Dechend was associated with one of the research laboratories at MIT. It appears de Santillana was for many years also associated with a research laboratory at MIT. (See: La Fondation du monde by Michael Demion (2011, Page 263.) This was obviously the Neurophysiology Laboratory. The Neurophysiology Research Group (Neurophysiology Laboratory) was formed within the Research Laboratory of Electronics. Its concept was an extension of the Research Laboratory of Electronics (and its investigations used Research Laboratory of Electronics equipment). Both the Research Laboratory of Electronics and the Neurophysiology Research Group were located in Building 20.) The most reliable source states that 1960-1969 she made regular research and teaching visits to MIT. (This period was her only break with her otherwise continuous employment, since November 1943, at the Institut für Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität, in Germany (founded by Willy Hartner).) In 1969 she returned to the University of Frankfort and her post as Professor of the History of Science (and Emeritius from 1980). (The Wikipedia article on Hamlet's Mill (January, 2010) erroneously identifies her as a scientist.)) (According to one source at the Institut für Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften her regular research and teaching visits to MIT spanned 1960-1969. According to another source she was a research associate at MIT for five winters spanning, 1962-1967. Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, is now perhaps the best guide. Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, Volumes 16-17, 1963, Page 458, has Hertha von Dechend as: Priv.-Doz. (Privatdozent (= holding all formal qualifications (both doctorate and habilitation) [unsalaried lecturer if a formal position not held?]) researching at MIT for winter semester 1964/1965 (... wird im WS 1964/65 zu Forschungszwecken am Massachusetts Institute of Technology ....). According to Who's who in Germany 1990: Part 1, A-L, Page 254: "Dechend ... spent six winter terms in visiting capacity at MIT, Cambridge, Mass., USA. 1960-1967 ...." (Once again, other sources give 1960-1969.) (See also: (MIT) Technology Review,



Volume 62, 1960, Page 76, for mention of "Herta von Dechend, Germany, protohistoric material of myths and legend ...." ) It is not evidence from MIT reports (i.e., Report of the President and the Chancellor) I have so far seen that von Dechend was there in 1967.
In summary, von Dechend attended MIT regularly for 3 reasons: (1) Her involvement with projects at the Neurophysiology Research Group (Neurophysiology Laboratory), (2) her involvement with de Santillana and his Humanities students in the Hamlet's Mill research project, and (3) presenting seminars (in conjunction with other MIT staff) on Ancient Cosmology.
In, Report of the President and the Chancellor 1978-79 Massachusetts Institute of Technology (page 35) under Visiting Faculty, Visiting Professors, (Personnel Changes) appears: "Hertha von Dechend Program in Science, Technology, and Society."
Abe Aronow recollects that people at MIT treated Hertha von Dechend with great respect. Harald Reiche was very courtly with her.
MIT policies and procedures
Two categories are applicable to Hertha von Dechend at MIT. Firstly, "research associate" (the designation that applied to her during the 1960s); secondly, "visiting professor" (which applied to her during the 1970s). Basically, (present-day) a research assistant at MIT is a member of a research group in a Laboratory or Project who works closely with a faculty supervisor and with other graduate students on a sponsored research project. In the current (2016) MIT policy on research appointments the category "senior research associate" (Academic Research Staff Appointments, Section 5.3) is included, but this is not relevant to von Dechend. For leads to relevant sources for early MIT policies and procedures (i.e., 1960s) see: Academia's Golden Age: Universities in Massachusetts, 1945-1970 by Richard Freeland (1992).
Excursus: Jayant Shah and Emma Duchane
In a letter to Abe Aronow dated July 22, 1991, Hertha von Dechend writes: " ... If all goes well I will stay in Cambridge from October 10 to December 3 (44 Kirkland St., Cambridge 01238 ...." This spacious property was built in 1902.
In late 1991 at least Hertha von Dechend stayed with the mathematician Jayant Shah and his physicist wife Emma Duchane (also known as Emma Buchane and Emma (Shah) Duchane) at their residence at 44 Kirkland Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts. (A 10 room, 5 bedroom house with upper storey and basement. The house is/was owned by Jayant Shah and Emma Duchane.) The previous address for Emma Duchane was 18 Tremont Street, Boston, MA. Jayant Shah obtained his PhD, MIT, 1974, and is a mathematics professor (currently 2013? Professor of Mathematics at Northeastern University (College of Science). His area of expertise is computer vision. Emma Duchane was a physics major at MIT in the 1950s (graduated 1957). As a graduate student she worked in the MIT Neurophysiology Laboratory with Jerry Lettvin and Walter Pitts, at least 1957-1958. As a graduate student she helped Jerome Lettvin measure the visual system of the frog (at least circa 1958). This assistive work by Emma Duchane may only have been done during the summer. (See the MIT Neurophysiology Laboratory Report for 1958.) (Throughout its history, graduate students play a central role in all of the Institute's wide-ranging research activities, making both an important contribution to the educational experience of students, faculty and to the success of the research itself.) In 1965 at least Emma Duchane worked for Arthur D. Little, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02140. It appears she also worked for Westinghouse Science Talent Search (STS) in Washington, DC. It appears that in 1953 she was a participant at the Science Talent Institute Week (also known as the Westinghouse Science Competition). Westinghouse conducted a yearly science talent search (Westinghouse Science Talent Search). Among her publications: User's Manual, Advanced FORTRAN IV Utilities for Data General Computers edited by Emma Duchane (1980). In 2015 both Emma and Jayant donated to The Conservancy for the Charles River parklands.

Note: According to one source von Dechend most often stayed with Mrs Reiche. Von Dechend was the only person she ever allowed to smoke in her home.
Hertha von Dechend's MIT seminars on archaic cosmology
It presently still remains difficult to establish exactly what was being done. Memories of several past students differ. It is not exactly clear whether the seminars were deemed undergraduate seminars or graduate seminars. Likely they were deemed undergraduate seminars. (It is usual to consider a degree an undergraduate qualification.) It is still difficult to establish when MIT had formally established an undergraduate seminars program. By at least the late 1970s MIT had formal administrative processes for student seminars.
In 1958 when von Dechend first met de Santillana she was not yet a Professor. A year after being appointed a Professor in 1960 she was teaching in some form - her ancient cosmology ideas at MIT. It is perhaps an indication of how few constraints were placed on MIT faculty members.
It would appear that Giorgio de Santillana organised the two seminars on archaic cosmology at MIT (in 1961 and 1966) that Hertha von Dechend lectured at. (It also appears that de Santillana was reliant on Lettvin for advice on organising seminars.) Von Dechend presented, at least in 1966, the topic titled "Introduction to Ancient Cosmology." It also appears that at these seminars Giorgio de Santillana actually gave most of the presentations. (According to Jerry Lettvin, Hertha von Dechend, though considered an excellent presenter and able to demonstrate enormous learning, was not comfortable speaking in English - her lack of fluency in English was a major barrier. However, Abe Aronow vaguely recollects: ". .... I believe the seminars started in 1960 or 61 and lasted long after I left for Hanover, New Hampshire, in July of 1962. The ones I attended were run by von Dechend. ... She was soft spoken but not shy.) On several occasions Jerome Lettvin presented (at least in 1966 but I am not sure about other year(s)). Von Dechend mentions in the early pages of the 1966 student notes that Lettvin would later address the participants (on early Medieval history of science issues?). (See his articles: "The Use of Myth." in Technology Review, Volume 78, Number 7, 1976, Pages 52-57, 63; and "The Gorgon's Eye." in Technology Review, Volume 80, Number 2, 1977, Pages 74-83. Technology Review is an MIT publication.) (See also: Technology Review, Volumes 80-81, 1977, Pages 100.) The core persons for the two seminars in the 1960s were undoubtedly Giorgio de Santillana, Hertha von Dechend, Harald Reiche, Jerome Lettvin, and Philip Morrison. In her 1961 seminar notes Hertha von Dechend refers to seminar speakers (plural). The language of some parts of the 1961 seminar notes indicate that sometimes it is Giorgio de Santillana that is presenting. This leads to the conclusion that her seminar notes reflect what was jointly presented by multiple presenters. (The collection of essays comprising the book Astronomy of the Ancients edited by Kenneth Brecher and Michael Fiertag (1979) was published in the same year as the last MIT seminar on ancient astronomy given by Hertha von Dechend. Both editors were MIT staff and 3 of the 8 essays were by MIT staff. Many of the essays in it can be considered an extension of Hamlet's Mill.)
Jerome Lettvin (telephone conversation, 15/9/2006) recollected - though not with certainty - that there were 5 or 6 (likely 6) seminars per term. By this I presume he meant that a seminar on ancient cosmology comprised some 6 meetings for its complete presentation. It is indicated as certain



that the format of a seminar comprised a series of weekly lectures/presentations. The length of each presentation comprising the complete seminar was (likely) 2 hours = a each seminar on ancient cosmology comprised a total of some 12 hours.
Lettvin was one of the few academic supporters and exponents of the views of Hertha von Dechend. See: "The Use of Myth: The tales of the Makers are the first language of science." by Jerome Lettvin (Technology Review, June, 1976, Pages 52-59).
No syllabus for any of the Archaic Cosmology/Ancient cosmology seminars appears to have survived. No evidence of a syllabus exists in her course notes. A syllabus is an outline or a summary of the main points of a text, lecture, or course of study. A reference to "Hertha von Dechend, syllabus for a course in ancient cosmology, MIT, spring, 1966, pages 38, 40.6." is somewhat cryptic. The seminars were likely held in the early evenings.
Unfortunately, the nature of von Dechend's involvement with the [Introduction to] Archaic Cosmology seminars at MIT, though mentioned by both herself and Uta Lindgren, are not clearly explained. (The seminars are nowhere mentioned in The Tech, MIT's oldest and largest newspaper, established in 1881.) However, (apparently) Technology Review, Volume 67, Number 1, November, 1964, Page 64, has a short article mentioning a 1964 (?) MIT seminar on "antiquity of science" (ancient cosmology) conducted by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend. Both are identified with the Department of Humanities. (Note: Volume 66 of Technology Review concluded with Number 9 published in July 1964.) A 1964 seminar is not indicated in other literature - the reference needs to be fully checked. Some excerpts obtainable through Google: "The search for regularity in the universe, a characteristic of modern science, began long before men learned to write, Professor Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend of the Department of Humanities have been pointing out in an M.I.T. seminar. The earliest science they say was archaic cosmology. It preceded the achievements of the Egyptians [!?] and the Greeks, and it was born even earlier than any ... [other recorded civilization]. ... The great creative period seems to comprise the span between 6000 and 2000 B.C. Psychological interpretations of documents found by archaeologists have misled us, Professor de Santillana thinks. From a re-examination of the findings of Nineteenth Century scholars, he and Dr. von Dechend have concluded that astronomy is an even older science than we have been taught, and was effectively diffused long before letters were invented."
In his book The Time Falling Bodies Take to Light (1996, Page 268) William Thompson states that Hertha von Dechend was [at least 1966-1967] part of the Department of Humanities at MIT. In his book The Time Falling Bodies Take to Light (1996, Page 268) William Thompson writes: "... Hertha von Dechend's syllabus for her course in "Ancient Cosmology" given at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1966-67." (At this time William Thompson (a cultural historian) was Associate Professor of Humanities (i.e., Associate Professor of Literature) Department of Humanities, MIT, and a colleague of Hertha von Dechend. According to William Thompson, in 1966 he was working as an instructor at MIT, in the Humanities. William Thompson's description of himself: "William Irwin Thompson (born July, 1938) is known primarily as a social philosopher and cultural critic, but he has also been writing and publishing poetry throughout his career and received the Oslo International Poetry Festival Award in 1986. He has made significant contributions to cultural history, social criticism, the philosophy of science, and the study of myth. He describes his writing and speaking style as "mind-jazz on ancient texts". He is an astute reader of science, social science, history, and literature. He is the founder of the Lindisfarne Association." In 1974 the occultist David Spangler (who was connected with the Findhorn Foundation) helped William Thompson found the Lindisfarne Association. The Findhorn Community is comprised of committed spiritual seekers (whose god is the biblical Yahweh). The Lindisfarne Association (1972-2012, now defunct) for the "study and realization of a new planetary culture." It was inspired by the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead's idea of an integral philosophy of organism, and by Teilhard de Chardin's idea of planetization.
It is indicated by some sources that the MIT seminars were not student seminars but seminars specifically convened for specialist academics. However, this may not be quite correct. The neurologist and psychiatrist Jerome Lettvin, a former professor at MIT and close associate of both Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend, recollects that each year the seminars were held there were a series of 5 or 6 seminars that would span a single term (or per each term for the year?) and the duration of each seminar was around 2 hours. (The organising of the seminars by way of fixing the dates was sporadic.) Circa 1967 Jerome Lettvin was focused on teaching the "History of experimental approaches to epistemology." Hertha von Dechend's lecture notes for the 1966 seminars are marked "Autumn, 1966, Introduction to Ancient Cosmology." For the 1979 seminars her lecture notes are simply marked "Fall, 1979." (The seminar title seems to have consistently been: Introduction to Ancient Cosmology. This was the exact title used for the 1966 seminar.) The seminars were open to everybody - students, faculty, and the public. Abe Aronow believes the seminars were likely held in the Humanities building. The seminars were possibly held in the Charles Hayden Memorial Library Lounge (Hayden Library Lounge, Room 14E-310 (also written as 14-E310)). (The starting time was likely 5.00 pm and the finishing time was likely 7.00 pm.) This room was frequently utilised by Giorgio de Santillana, and also other Humanities Department staff, when organising the presentation of lectures by visiting academics. (It was located on level 4 mezzanine?) It was the Humanities Library (built 1950), and Giorgio de Santillana was in the Humanities Department. The American Historical Association Newsletter, Volume 6, 1967, noted de Santillana's retirement in that year. The (3hour) colloquium to honour Giorgio de Santillana on his retirement was held in the Hayden Library Lounge (in May, 1967) which comfortably seated two hundred attendees. (The exact location of 14E-310 is a little confusing. Building 14E is described as being located near the Hayden Library. The address for 14E-310 appears as 160 Memorial Drive, Cambridge.) During 1961 at least Giorgio de Santillana was teaching the course "The Origins of Scientific Thought." Immediately before his retirement he was focused on teaching Greek and Renaissance scientific thought. At the time of his death in 1974 Giorgio de Santillana was Professor Emeritus, History and Philosophy of Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
According to Phil Norfleet, a student of de Santillana at MIT during the 1960s, de Santillana's seminars were usually reserved for graduate students. "The capstones of the new Course XXI are the special senior seminars which will be offered for the first time in 1957 and for which Professor Karl W. Deutsch and Professor Giorgio D. de Santillana are already preparing materials." (Massachusetts Institute of Technology Bulletin, Volume 92, Number 3, November 1956, President’s Report Issue for the Year Ending October 1, 1956, Page 112.) The organisation of these senior/graduate seminars were likely the basis for the later "Ancient Cosmology" seminars.
The clarifying answer comes from: Astronomy and Mythological Cosmology and Cosmogony in the Midrash Rabba and Zohar by Abraham Aronow (May 12, 1962, Department of Humanities, Course XXI-B, Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, June, 1962 [103 Pages]). Extracts: "Acknowledgements [Page 3]. I would like to thank Dr, Hertha von Dechend and Professor Giorgio de Santillana for their inspiration and assistance. I would like, also, to thank Miss Susan B. Chase and Miss Barbara R. Leopold for their technical assistance." "Preface [Page 4, 2/6/62] In the very recent past I have been a small part of a large inquiry into the similarities that existed in many diverse ancient cultures. The inquiry has been mainly concerned with the astronomy, the cosmology, the cosmogony, and the accompanying mythological accounts of "the Creation" in the early civilizations of this planet. The prime movers of this project, my advisors and my constant inspiration, are Dr. Hertha von Dechend and Prof. Giorgio de Santillana. It is my hope that my small contribution will be of use to them in the later, correlative aspects of their study." "Second Preface [Pages 5-6, 4/21/62]. In the course of writing the body of my thesis, I have been very apprehensive, for I feared that 21.85 might be a necessary prerequisite for a lucid reading of this paper. 21.85 is catalogued as "Introduction to Cosmology" and is a seminar designed to perform a preliminary reconnaissance into cosmological



patterns, both ancient and modern. The purpose of this reconnaissance is to establish a basis for a school of comparative celestial culture. This new field is an interesting synthesis of: astrology, mythology anthropology, and history of science. The seminar (1961-62) was composed of students of varied background and divergent interests. The lack of homogeneity in the group was the key to its great success. Prof. de Santillana and Dr. von Dechend gave preliminary lectures and a reading list and then each individual selected the corridor of research which most suited his abilities and interests. At one meeting, Prof. de Santillana named the group, "the crazy cosmology club"; the name has stuck. This name seems to typify the average outsider's attitude towards the seeming lack of rigour in out investigative techniques. I shall try, in the following introduction, to dispell some of the reader's fears concerning the apparent investigative randomness of this research technique, and to delineate clearly the exact aims, boundaries and goals of my own contribution. I would strongly recommend that the reader secure and read a copy of An Introduction to Cosmology by Dechend and de Santillana prior to reading this paper. I choose to investigate Hebrew literature because I am fortunate enough to be fairly facile in that language. Prior to the organization of the cosmology seminar I had several occasions to be of assistance to Prof. de Santillana and Dr. von Dechend because of my Hebrew. Several other students in the seminar also chose topics which were related to a Foreign language in which they could read primary source material." The seminars were connected with the "project group," an undergraduate group of students enrolled with de Santillana's humanities course, and doing course work connected with the preparation of Hamlet's Mill.
Jerry Lettvin told Abe Aronow that he substituted for von Dechend on some lectures.
Presently the critics at the time regarding lack of methodological rigour remain unidentified (forgotten with the passage of time). It is likely the MIT critics of von Dechend's methodology expressed their views at the regular social/interactive meetings at Lettvin's Research Laboratory of Electronics in Building 20.
An article in Technology Review, Volumes 80-81, 1977, makes a reference to a Santillana?/Dechend seminar at MIT. This may have clarifying information. The puzzle presently remains. Ernest McClain (Bibal (Bibal Study Group, December 6, 2006) identifies MIT seminars and at least 1 presentation event at Boston, whilst Yas Maeyama (Obituary for Hertha von Dechend, UniReport 5, 2001) mentions special yearly symposiums in Boston to which people were invited. According to Yas Maeyama von Dechend was invited each year to a special symposium in Boston (on archaic cosmology?). Hertha von Dechend's papers from a 1976/1977 seminar on ancient cosmology are available.
Ernest McClain (1918-2014) (2 personal communications, May 6, 2012): [Regarding MIT.] "Reiche invited me to lead one evening discussion for about 3 hours, as I remember, perhaps 6:9 p.m. or thereabout, around 1980 [perhaps 1977?]. I talked, there was very little discussion, and none with her except for a few minutes in his office. They were intent on giving me a chance to explain myself to their own total bewilderment, I believe in the interim between two essays that Reiche himself published on Atlantis. [Regarding Boston.] Ernest McClain (e-mail, 6th November 2011) has given more details: "Forty years [ago], and at M.I.T. where I led a 3-hour seminar with zero understanding from the professor who invited me; he could not imagine "a musical fifth" as part of an octave." About 1992-3 Jon Polansky [Dr. Jon Polansky, Research Scientist, Associate Professor, University of California, San Francisco], then editor of ESOP [Epigraphic Society Occasional Papers], invited me to a weeklong conference in Boston, putting up those of us from out of town up in a hotel where we met all morning and afternoon for a serious (sic) [series] of many presentations and vigorous discussion, and at lunch and dinner. That was an extremely valuable experience for me, but I cannot remember if she [Hertha von Dechend] actually made a presentation, which seems likely. We were each given perhaps an hour or more followed by detailed scrutiny. But I cannot add any detail to what happened at M.I.T. I never met de Santillana whose feeling for Pythagoreanism was deep and articulate. [Note: Galileo held Pythagorean convictions.] HAMLET'S MILL was clearly her work, he makes clear, completely ignoring his own brilliant introduction. It was NOT possible to discuss music or math with Reiche and von Dechend. Unfortunately, it took me another 30 years to discover the overlap between us concerning Holy Mountain Meru, twin-peaked within 60^5=777,600,000, that I had mishandled at every effort within THE MYTH OF INVARIANCE. ... It [MIT] was in the process of disengaging from a 1950s effort to integrate other humanist studies. .... [Note: In the 1960s MIT was given a grant from the Carnegie Corporation to design new courses in the humanities for scientists and engineers. William Thompson, who stayed 3 years at MIT, was involved in this. He designed a particular new course.] As I remember me (sic) [my] one appearance at M.I.T. there may have been 20 or 30 listeners. There was no pointed questioning of assumptions, data, or conclusions. It was a "non-event." At the Boston conclave under Polansky, there were about a dozen of us, and the interchange was considerable and people were gracious. He belonged at M.I.T." (Note: Polansky, a cultural diffusionist, at that period of time was an associate professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center and the director of the laboratory that first isolated and cloned the gene responsible for glaucoma; he was a student of Barry Fell's at Harvard in the 1960s.)
It would appear that Reiche and von Dechend held another MIT (ancient cosmology ?) seminar in 1977 (or thereabouts) which was entirely focused on the ideas of McClain, and at which he was the sole presenter. Then circa 1992-1993 both McClain and von Dechend were invited attendees and presenters at annual conference organised by the Epigraphic Society (on ancient cosmology ?). To my question whether the composition of the MIT audience of 20-30 persons were professionals or students, or both, Ernest McClain emailed (8/5/12): "I took them to be students. The Boston conference was private to ESOP members and guests." The claim by Leroy Ellenberger (e-mail post Friday, 2 September, 1994 to talk.origins) in which he wrote that "McClains lifework is held in the highest regard by ... Hertha von Dechend ... [and] Herald (sic) reiche (sic) ...." is at odds with McClains statements that neither could understand his arguments. In 2006 McClain wrote that he was "NO fan of von Dechend."
Excurcus: William Thompson
William Thompson (born 1938) is known primarily as a social philosopher and cultural critic. He has also written poetry throughout his career and in 1986 received the Oslo International Poetry Festival Award. He has also written a novel about the legendary Atlantis. He describes his writing and speaking style as "mind-jazz on ancient texts." Thompson was born in Chicago and grew up in Los Angeles. Thompson received his B.A. at Pomona College and his Ph.D. at Cornell University. He was a professor of humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then at York University in Toronto. He has held visiting appointments at Syracuse University, the University of Hawaii, University of Toronto, and the California Institute of Integral Studies. Interestingly, when at MIT, Thompson could not identify any scientists he felt would openly embrace and deeply comprehend the contemplatively-grounded and cosmologically-oriented tradition of what he deemed as authentic Western science which stemmed from the mystically inclined and musically adept Pythagoras. In 1973, he left academia to become the founding director of the Lindisfarne Association, an international community and educational centre in Southampton, New York. (The Lindisfarne Association is a group of scientists, poets, and religious scholars who met in order to discuss and to participate in the "emerging planetary culture." Thompson claimed that this so-called planetary culture was energetically emerging in numerous marginal places in our midst in salient contrast to the powerfulappearing but actually declining urban-industrial civilization of militarized nation-states. (Thompson categorised WWII and the organised movement of armies across the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean as an example of a 'planetary system of coordination.') With his background as a cultural historian, student of Kriya yoga and professor of the humanities, Thompson pointed to such cultural figures of the 1970s as the Californian poet Gary Snyder, the architect Paolo Soleri from Arizona, the British author Doris Lessing and the German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen as artistic harbingers of this new planetary sensibility. In 1976 the Lindisfarne Association moved from Long Island to Manhattan.) According to Wikipedia: "Thompson is influenced by British philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, Swiss cultural historian Jean Gebser, mystic Rudolf Steiner, the Vedic philosopher Sri Aurobindo Ghose, the famous Kriya Yoga proponent Paramahansa Yogananda with his introduction of



Hindu Vedic principles and practices (such as yoga) to the Western populace, and media ecologist Marshall McLuhan. Thompson engages a diverse set of traditions, including the autopoetic epistemology of Francisco Varela, the endosymbiotic theory of evolution of Lynn Margulis, the Gaia Theory of James Lovelock, the complex systems thought of Ralph Abraham, the novels of Thomas Pynchon, and mystic David Spangler." The Lindisfarne Association brought together people whose beliefs in common were either deriving considerable inspiration from the 20th-century seers who first claimed to have discerned an evolutionary shift toward supramental mystical consciousness and the planetization of human culture, namely Sri Aurobindo from the East and Teilhard de Chardin from the West, or were devoted to a spiritual practice rooted in one of the great contemplative traditions, such as Zen Buddhism or Sufism. In the 1980s Thompson took up lengthy residence in Switzerland. Thompson is (2015) in "retirement" but still actively writing, working with the Ross school as an educational consultant, and is back in Southampton, New York again. His early concern about bringing science and religion together on behalf of the global environment was taken up in 1990 by the Global Forum of Spiritual and Parliamentary Leaders.
William Thompson falls within the category of a 'New Age' activist and has some unusual beliefs. Thompson writes that ancient Atlantean civilisation was the impetus for Sumerian civilisation. See his book: At the Edge of History and Passages about Earth: A Double Book, Pages 164. Also, "repetition-compulsion" indicates that the catastrophe that ended Atlantis, though suppressed in history, has remained in "memory traces" of the collective unconscious. See: At the Edge of History and Passages about Earth: A Double Book, Pages 165.
Some presentations given by Giorgio de Santillana prior to publication of Hamlet's Mill
Date Location Topic Comments
1961
University of Oxford, England
"On Forgotten Sources in the History of Science"
It would seem, however, that the ideas of Hamlet's Mill were first publicly put forward by de Santillana in an address given at a 1961 symposium in England. (See his presentation: "On Forgotten Sources in the History of Science" In: Crombie, A. (Editor). Scientific Change (1963), Pages 813-828, with participant commentary in succeeding pages. The book comprises the Symposium on the History of Science at the University of Oxford, 9-15 July, 1961. In the content of the book he acknowledges his great debt to Hertha von Dechend (who declined to be acknowledged as a joint author) and considers it a joint paper. Interestingly, Hertha von Dechend is listed as a member of the 1961 Symposium - but Giorgio de Santillana is not. (Amongst the listed papers of Joseph Needham held at Cambridge (England) the following record appears: Title: Joseph Needham's notes from a talk on 'astral myths' by Herta (sic) von Dechend at a Symposium in Oxford; Reference: SCC2/69/1/28; Covering Dates: 13 July 1961; Extent and Medium: 1 document; Paper.)
1963 Turin, Italy
"Fato antico e fato moderno" ("Ancient and Modern Ideas of Fate")
The committee of the Associazione Culturale Italiana invited de Santillana to give a lecture in Turin in March, 1963, entitled "Fato antico e fato moderno" ("Ancient and Modern Ideas of Fate"). This lecture is overlooked, but is of some importance. One of the major points of the lecture was the idea that "the great cosmological myths both preceded and had been the equivalent of modern science." ("When lecturing in Italy in 1963 Giorgio de Santillana restated the theory that a scientific hypothesis precedes the formulation of a myth." (Understanding Italo Calvino by Beno Weiss (1993, Page 95).)) The lecture originally given in 1963 was first published as a short essay in 1968. (There appears to be some confusion whether it is a short essay or an uncommon book.) It deals with the history of science and mythologies and mimics themes in Hamlet's Mill. It views ancient myths as the first attempts at scientific thinking and practice and the ancient practice of measuring and numbering physical reality as an effort to create meaning and make the world/universe accessible. According to de Santillana the ancient concept of fate implied a precise comprehension of physical reality and how we are influenced by it. Myth has a cosmological dimension and humankind's oldest myths derive from celestial observations.
1966 MIT,
Massachusetts
"Archaic Cosmology in Renaissance Literature"
In 1966 MIT hosted the yearly New England Renaissance Conference (NERC). The 1966 conference dates were Friday April 29 and Saturday April 30. During the morning of the Saturday program Giorgio de Santillana presented the 2nd and last paper – "Archaic Cosmology in Renaissance Literature" – for around 1 hour and 15 minutes. (Though the paper may now be lost the type of content may perhaps be gleaned from his book review of Yate's work on Giordano Bruno where he pointed to certain problems presented by the "churning turbid flood" of Hermetic, Cabalistic and other esoteric literature.) The venue for the presentation of the conference papers was the Library Lounge, Hayden Library Building (on Memorial Drive), MIT.
1967 Paris, France
"The Great Cosmological Doctrines"
"The Great Cosmological Doctrines." by Giorgio de Santillana. In: Science and Synthesis: An International Colloquium organized by Unesco on the Tenth Anniversary of the Death of Albert Einstein and Teilhard de Chardin [1967]. (1971, Pages 37-45, Page 43). In his presentation to the International Colloquium organized by UNESCO on the Tenth Anniversary of the Death of Albert Einstein and Teilhard de Chardin, de Santillana presented on the themes of Hamlet's Mill. De Santillana presented on modern cosmologies within the historical perspective of the ancient cosmological doctrines: "The Great Cosmological Doctrines." He also voiced his support for James Frazer, Jane Harrison, Arthur Cooke, and the Myth and Ritual School. Interestingly, de Santillana states his belief that the source of the "universal mythical language" was protohistoric Mesopotamia and that he is unable to offer an explanation for how this astronomical code code travelled by diffusion. In mentioning "the Ecliptic and its constellations" de Santillana obviously (and erroneously) believes in a very ancient zodiac.
1968 Rome, Italy
"Sirius as a Permanent Center in the Archaic Universe"
The last joint publication by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend was a conference paper that appeared in 1970. I am not aware of who presented the paper. (See: "Sirius as a permanent center in the archaic universe." by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend. In: Enrico Castelli (Editor). Eternità e storia (1970). (Pages 235-263). The publication in which the paper appears is a collection of 1968 conference papers presented in Rome. Other details: I Valori Permanenti nel Divenire Storico. Atti del Convegno Internationale promosso delT Istituto Accademico di Roma, Roma 3.-6.10.1968.)
MIT Seminars/Symposiums
It is indicated that some confusion now exists regarding recollections of MIT seminars/symposiums relating to ancient astronomy. The decade for these is indicated as the 1960s. A seminar is a conference or other meeting for discussion or training, in which a topic is discussed. A seminar was followed by a moderated panel discussion. A symposium is a formal conference or meeting to discuss a particular subject i,e., an academic conference or meeting. Specialists in a particular area/field meet to present on and discuss a subject of mutual interest. Seminars/seminar groups were usual at MIT. Seminars could be held during day or evening.



A colloquium is an academic conference or seminar.
Seminars could be organised by departments/persons/alumni groups. An Alumni (1-) day seminar/symposium could comprise 1-day or 1⁄2-day. It is now not easy to recover Department of Humanities seminars held during the 1960s. Von Dechend held several seminars on archaic cosmology during the 1950s at MIT. I can only find a single reference (presently misplaced) in The Technology Review regarding a seminar on Ancient Astronomy being organised (circa 1967?) for Humanities students. The organisers were a Senior Alumni group and a MIT professor of astrophysics, who conferred on the content.
MIT alumni seminars involved multiple meetings and multiple topics. Short "special summer programs" (= seminars) were scheduled at MIT circa the late 1960s. Up to circa 30 could be held over the summer break. These are indicated as being sponsored by Alumni Groups in association with a relevant professor. The seminars were led by administrators/student leaders/professors. A summer seminar was usually a multi-day event over 23 weeks. Preparation of Senior Alumni Seminars involved cooperation between relevant lecturers (professors) and students and attendance by both. The content of the seminar was discussed between the parties. Professors/lecturers attended as part of the audience.
The astrophysicist Professor Brecher organised a seminar/symposium series (The Astronomy of the Ancients) at MIT in January 1977. The contributions were collected/published in a special issue of The Technology Review. He was assisted by Michael Feirtag (MIT Board of Editors). Also presented were series of lectures for MIT students.
Table of MIT course/seminar notes on ancient cosmology by de Santillana and/or von Dechend (and others) pre-1969 and post-1969
Year Title Author(s) Purpose
1961. (19611962 according to Abe Aronow.)
Introduction to Cosmology: A Preliminary
Reconnaissance. [No date, but 1961.] Note: It is indicated that supplementary pages were regularly issued (at least for 1961-1962). The MIT course notes with the title, Introduction to Cosmology: A Preliminary Reconnaissance by H. von Dechend [and] G. de Santillana, originally issued in 1961 as 152 pages of notes for the topic "Ancient Cosmology" within the regular Humanities course (XXI-B), enable some insight. These notes supported the course topic "Ancient Cosmology" which ran at least 1961-1962 and was presented by de Santillana and von Dechend. It appears that eventually some 100 supplementary pages were issued. The overall purpose of the course was to establish a basis for a school of comparative celestial culture, and also establish a student Hamlet's Mill project group. Material from Abraham Aronow's Bachelor of Science research project on the Kabbalah - when still in progress and uncompleted - was incorporated into Introduction to Cosmology: A Preliminary Reconnaissance.
Hertha von Dechend and Giorgio de Santillana.
MIT seminar on "antiquity of science" (ancient cosmology) conducted by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend. It would appear that Giorgio de Santillana organised the 2 seminars on archaic cosmology at MIT in 1961 and 1966 that Hertha von Dechend lectured at. It appears the 1st seminar at least was run by Hertha von Dechend. It seems indicated that the topic of Ancient Cosmology was taught for a year or two as a subject of the regular Humanities course. Connected at least with Department of Humanities, Course XXI-B. This seminar was designed to perform a preliminary reconnaissance into cosmological patterns, both ancient and modern. The purpose of the reconnaissance was to establish a basis for a school of comparative celestial culture. This new field is a synthesis of: astrology, mythology anthropology, and history of science. The seminars were connected with the "project group," an undergraduate group of students enrolled with de Santillana's Humanities course, and doing course work connected with the preparation of Hamlet's Mill. In her 1961 seminar notes Hertha von Dechend refers to seminar speakers (plural). The language of some parts of the 1961 seminar notes indicate that sometimes it is Giorgio de Santillana that is presenting. This leads to the conclusion that her seminar notes reflect what was jointly presented by multiple presenters. Note: My early copies of 3 sets of Hertha von Dechend's MIT course notes are not be entirely complete, at least regarding the "cover pages." Only 2 course codes are given. One set - from 1961 (a footnote on page 152 indicates the date for this set is definitely 1961) - is untitled. (Regarding the 1st set of notes - some figures are missing. Pages 109-114 are missing. Pages 135-140 are also missing (and preceded by pages 134A and 134B). The last page is 247 with no clear indication if this is indeed the final page for the notes. (There is reason to believe that page 152 was originally the final page but supplementary pages were later issued.)
1964?
Unknown for certain. However, the MIT course notes, Introduction to Ancient Cosmology by
Hertha von Dechend, issued in 1966, also enables some insight. Introductory comments strongly imply the course had also been presented 19641965. Also, these are new course notes with a different approach to presenting the material, to enable better understanding by students of the theme being promoted. It appears that from 1961 to 1965 Humanities students undertaking the "Ancient Cosmology" module were experiencing difficulty in comprehending the ideas being promoted.
Hertha von Dechend and Giorgio de Santillana (if presented in this year).
Apparently, Technology Review, Volume 67, Number 1, November, 1964, Page 64, has a short article mentioning a 1964 (?) MIT seminar on "antiquity of science" (ancient cosmology) conducted by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend.
Spring 1966. (19661967?)
Introduction to Ancient Cosmology. (Hertha von Dechend's lecture notes for the 1966 seminars are marked, "21.93 T Autumn, 1966, Introduction to Ancient Cosmology.") These are new course notes with a different approach to presenting the material, to enable better understanding by students of the theme being promoted. It appears that from 1961 to 1965 Humanities students undertaking the "Ancient Cosmology" module were experiencing difficulty in comprehending the ideas being promoted. In the latter pages von

Ancient cosmology seminar. Von Dechend presented, at least in 1966, the topic titled "Introduction to Ancient Cosmology." It also appears that at these seminars Giorgio de Santillana actually gave most of the presentations. Course code: 21.93 T, Autumn, 1966. ([Course] 21.93 T, Autumn, 1966, Introduction to Ancient Cosmology.) The number 21 identifies Course XXI (= Humanities) that was begun in 1952 at MIT. This identifies that the seminars were conducted as part of (or under the auspices of) Course XXI (Humanities). STS is the MIT abbreviation for: Science, Technology, and Society. The seminars (or at least the latter 2) would seem to be presented as part of the Independent Activities Period (IAP) which is



Dechend several times writes of the 'Essay' by de Santillana and her that is being prepared for publication.
a special 4-week term held each year that runs from the first week of January until the end of January. The IAP provides members of the MIT community (students, faculty, staff, and alumni) with the opportunity to organise, sponsor, and participate in a wide variety of activities, including forums and lecture series that are not possible during the semester. All of these short courses of one term duration, were, and still are, open to the MIT university community. (It appears that for "Ancient Cosmology" there were 6 seminars per term of approximately 2 hours each.) Judging by recent examples a seminar series conducted during this short term would, and still do, usually consist of a weekly evening lecture of 2-3 hours (by one of more presenters), some expected core reading, and some minor essays/projects. (An IAP could also occur during the Spring.) Strictly speaking Winter (89 days) begins on December 21. Autumn/Fall (90 days) begins on September 22. The nature of the seminar coding, however, seems to clearly support this type of identification of von Dechend's seminars. The appendices of Hamlet's Mill were largely comprised of the chapter end notes accompanying the text of her seminar notes.
1976-1977.
Introduction to Ancient Cosmology. (The essayspresentations are German-language Presumably the presentations were given in English (if presented at MIT and not at Frankfurt). The essaypresentations are different in style and content to her Spring/Autumn 1966 lecture notes.) Available - through the effort of Franz Krojer - is the book containing her presentations for her 1976/1977 seminar: Einführung in die Archaische Kosmologie. Vorlesungen im Wintersemester 1976/77 (Differenz-Verlag, München 2011). (Details: Hertha von Dechend, Einführung in die Archaische Kosmologie [Introduction to the Archaic Cosmology] Vorlesungen im

Hertha von Dechend.
It would appear that Harald Reiche and Hertha von Dechend held another MIT (ancient cosmology ?) seminar in 1977 (or thereabouts). According to one source it was entirely focused on the ideas of Ernest McClain, and at which he was the sole presenter. This source, however, appears to be incorrect. (An article in Technology Review, Volumes 80-81, 1977, makes a reference to a Santillana?/Dechend seminar at MIT. De Santillana was of course deceased by this time.)
1979.
For the 1979 seminars von Dechend's lecture notes are simply marked "Fall, 1979" and include course code: 21.965 J = STS 630 J, (The seminar title seems to have consistently been: "Introduction to Ancient Cosmology." This was the exact title used for the 1966 seminar.) Also, The collection of essays comprising the book Astronomy of the Ancients edited by Kenneth Brecher and Michael Fiertag (1979) was published in the same year as the last MIT seminar on ancient astronomy given by Hertha von Dechend.
Various. Both editors were MIT staff and 3 of the 8 essays were by MIT staff.
Course code: 21.965 J = STS 630 J, Fall, 1979. ([Course] 21.965 J = STS 630 J, Fall, 1979, untitled.) Note: Many of the essays in the book Astronomy of the Ancients can be considered an extension of Hamlet's Mill.
Regarding the 1976-1977 Winter Semester Seminar
Unfortunately the book of the Winter Semester 1976-1977 really only contains her 16 seminar essay-presentations (Vorlesungen im Wintersemester 1976/77 (Lectures in Winter Semester 1976/77)) in the German-language. It does not contain any details about the seminar. Also, there appears to be no seminar participant notes. The format is apparently a straight series of presentations.

Von Dechend's command of the English-language
From the content of a 3-page letter (from West Germany) dated Christmas, 1962, it is indicated that Hertha von Dechend had a strong command of the English-language (and could read English-language books). Abe Aronow recalls that: Hertha von Dechend's English was excellent, spoken and written. She spoke with a charming and cultured accent.
However, given circumstances, von Dechend would converse in German. Abe Aronow recalls that "Although, I'm not sure of the year (mid1980's) I had a wonderful lunch with HATOR and HvD at a German restaurant in Harvard Sq. ... It was fun to be with the two of them switching among several languages. My German is pretty poor, so they would look at me and return to English."
Health issues affecting Hertha von Dechend
In a letter to her friends ("within the realm of 14N-4 ..." [= likely MIT building and room designation]), dated Christmas, 1962, Hertha von Dechend writes from Taunus-Sanatorium about her treatment and progress with being cured of Tbc (= tuberculosis). She writes of being constantly tired. Indicated is the costs were covered by the University, and the matter of her illness was discretely handled by the University. The renowned Taunus-Sanatorium for consumptive diseases is situated 980 metres above sea-level on the south side of the climatically ideal Taunus hills near the village of Naurod (6.5 kilometres from the city of Wiesbaden) in southwest Germany. The Sanatorium has magnificent views over the Rhine and Main plains. Von Dechend states that she has a constant flow of visitors and telephone calls from colleagues. Interestingly, she remarks that she is continuing to receive "books from Antiquarians and the like." After being cured she did not give up smoking.
Von Dechend's aim at MIT
It would seem that Hertha von Dechend (and also Giorgio de Santillana) ultimately hoped/intended to establish a 'school of comparative celestial culture.' A new field comprising a synthesis of: astrology, mythology, anthropology, and history of science. This ambition may have been connected with the 1960s MIT grant from the Carnegie Corporation to design new courses in the humanities. Whatever, it is likely that the combination of the poor reception of Hamlet's Mill and the death of de Santillana several years after its publication put an end to such hopes on the part of von Dechend.
Interestingly, von Dechend may have begun teaching her views on ancient cosmology at MIT before she did so at the Institute for the History of Science, Frankfurt am Main. De Santillana had offered her an audience of students, perhaps her first time opportunity to teach her ideas on ancient cosmology. Von Dechend's student seminars were taught as dogma. This is simply evident from reading the student notes for the seminars.
The book Hamlet's Mill is obviously not what was planned as an outcome. It was not the master work it was perhaps intended to be. For whatever reasons it was, in the end, de Santillana's inadequate editing of von Dechend's disorganised 'project group' seminar notes. Obviously no 'file card' system of notes had been implemented to help sort and manage accumulating information. Rather surprisingly, there is no indication that material from any undergraduate thesis arising out of the 'project group' was used. (Abe Aronow recollects that there was some of the student material, without attribution, in the early manuscript of Hamlet’s Mill.) The fate of these theses is not known.
Rick Flavin, Flavin's Corner, 5-4-01, The Woman Who Wondered: "Frau Von Dechend may well have been inspired by Frobinius (sic), however the direction and method of her work was entirely her own. ... Her major publications were few .... ... Hamlet's Mill deserves more than a concise treatment. Much more. Frau Von Dechend undertook a revised, second edition in (Die Mühle des Hamlet. Ein Essay über Mythos und das Gerüst der Zeit, Berlin: Kammerer und Unverzagt, 1993), but a possible English translation is still being considered. ... The book needed a copy-editor and should have been longer. At issue is Hamlet's Mill as a usable text. The wonder remains for all to enjoy; unfortunately Hamlet's Mill provides little beyond serving as a template for further research .... That they wrote too fast and loose is only acknowledged by those who want more. ... Indeed, the authors often do not distinguish with scholarly prejudice between primary and secondary sources, nor do they appear to differentiate between attested early traditions and later ones. These are serious, but not fatal, flaws in the authors' presentation and methodology." Note that even the sympathetic Richard Flavin notes that all that was achieved was a 'template.'
After de Santillana's death, even with Reiche being in charge of the School of Humanities, the nature and purpose of the 'ancient astronomy/cosmology' seminars was likely different. There is no indication that the undergraduate 'project group' approach was maintained once Hamlet's Mill was published.
Also, the subject matter of de Santillana's course kept changing. H73 & H74 were Science and Philosophy.
Von Dechend's interpretation of myth likely predetermined
Von Dechend was imaginative. Also, she basically claimed that her insights enabled her to pioneer the correct interpretation of mythology. (See her comments in: Introduction to Ancient Cosmology (1966).)



It is difficult to believe she had not considered an astronomical interpretation prior to her study of Polynesian mythology. Von Dechend appears to have believed it was possible - through the remnants of mythology - to conduct "mental archaeology" of ancient preliterate cultures. In their book, A Sumerian Observation of the Köfels' Impact Event (2008) the authors Alan Bond and Mark Hempsell make it clear that prior to tackling the translation they had already decided on the type of information recorded on the tablet (i.e., an asteroid hit with earth). (Quite fantastically Mark Hempsell has several times claimed their translation success was enabled by their knowing the content of the tablet prior to making the translation!) It is likely that the same reasoning impelled von Dechend. Von Dechend's preoccupation with mythology reduced it to precessional language. This is linked to the Panbabylonian obsession of von Dechend.
Also, a tantalising clue was perhaps revealed by Jerry Lettvin in his article, "The Use of Myth." (MIT Technology Review, June 1976, Pages 5257) when he wrote "You can't even guess what is meant [in myth] unless you know what is meant."
Hertha von Dechend's MIT course notes
My copy of Hertha von Dechend's MIT course notes (purchased from a bookseller in France) may not be entirely complete, at least regarding the "cover pages." (The bookseller received 3 sets of von Dechend's MIT course notes from Harald Reiche (because of mutual interest in the subject matter).) Only 2 course codes are given. One set - from 1961? - is untitled. (Regarding the 1st set of notes. A footnote on page 152 indicates the date for this set is definitely 1961. Some figures are missing. Pages 109-114 are missing. Pages 135-140 are also missing (and preceded by pages 134A and 134B). The last page is 247 with no clear indication if this is indeed the final page for the notes. When time is found, a reread of the other 2 sets may locate the missing pages.) The other have course codes and year. These course codes are: (1) 21.93 T, Autumn, 1966; and (2) 21.965 J = STS 630 J, Fall, 1979. ([Course] 21.93 T, Autumn, 1966, Introduction to Ancient Cosmology; and (2) [Course] 21.965 J = STS 630 J, Fall, 1979, untitled.) These course codes, even given my remoteness in time and space and familiarity, help to identify the nature of her MIT seminars. The number 21 identifies Course XXI (= Humanities) that was begun in 1952 at MIT. This identifies that the seminars were conducted as part of (or under the auspices of) Course XXI (Humanities). STS is the MIT abbreviation for: Science, Technology, and Society. The seminars (or at least the latter 2) would seem to be presented as part of the Independent Activities Period (IAP) which is a special 4-week term held each year that runs from the first week of January until the end of January. The IAP provides members of the MIT community (students, faculty, staff, and alumni) with the opportunity to organise, sponsor, and participate in a wide variety of activities, including forums and lecture series that are not possible during the semester. All of these short courses of one term duration, were, and still are, open to the MIT university community. (It appears that for "Ancient Cosmology" there were 6 seminars per term of approximately 2 hours each.) Judging by recent examples a seminar series conducted during this short term would, and still do, usually consist of a weekly evening lecture of 2-3 hours (by one of more presenters), some expected core reading, and some minor essays/projects. (An IAP could also occur during the Spring.) Strictly speaking Winter (89 days) begins on December 21. Autumn/Fall (90 days) begins on September 22. The nature of the seminar coding, however, seems to clearly support this type of identification of von Dechend's seminars. (According to William Thompson (The Time Falling bodies Take to Light) Hertha von Dechend (Spring, 1966) issued a detailed syllabus for "... her course in "Ancient Cosmology" given at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1966-67." From memory this is the only reference to one of her MIT seminars extending across 2 years.)
Problems with the seminar methods
"In the last two years we did try to skip any kind of theoretical introduction, jumping instead right into the middle of explaining cosmological myths. But this procedure turned out to be bewildering, particularly our 'habit' of comparing items from civilizations coming from the farthest away from each other parts of our globe without visible restraint." (Introduction to Ancient Cosmology by Hertha von Dechend (1966, Page I.).
Hertha von Dechend's unpublished lecture notes
Her unpublished lecture manuscripts (described as 15 typed, bound volumes, averaging 120 pages in length, of her Frankfurt University lectures) are now in the Renaissance Institute at the University of Frankfort. David Ulansey posted to The Mithras List (February 3, 2002): "... A number of years ago I had lunch at M.I.T. with Hertha von Dechend and her friend Harold Reiche (an M.I.T. professor). After lunch, Reiche took me back to his office and showed me an entire shelf of DOZENS of thick volumes of bound, typed manuscripts. These, he told me, were the UNPUBLISHED writings of von Dechend on astral mythology. I mention this because some of you ... who are interested in diving deeper into the whirlpool of the pre-history of precession and astral myth in general might be interested in going to M.I.T. and tracking down these manuscripts (Reiche died several years ago, but they must be somewhere)...." This description - at variance with those given by others - raises questions regarding accuracy. What is the exact number that 'DOZENS' means; what exactly is meant by thick volumes of bound, typed manuscripts;' what does UNPUBLISHED writings mean? There is no reason to believe the number could exceed 2 dozen; there is no reason to believe any exceeded 120 pages (or that double spacing was used, which would increase the number of pages); the claim for bound volumes seems odd for what is likely lecture notes but Reiche may have had his copies bound; and there is no reason to believe 'UNPUBLISHED writings' infers completed manuscripts, not lecture notes. As I discuss below, von Dechend's lecture notes were simply 'a mess' and not coherent. There is no evidence that any of these manuscripts were published. Interestingly, it appears that Ulansey made no attempt to look inside any of these manuscripts. I certainly would have, We do not know what they actually contained. We do not even know if the manuscripts were in German or English. From at least circa 1970 von Dechend was lecturing on archaic cosmology at the University of Frankfurt. She retired circa 1980. The 'revised' edition of Hamlet's Mill in German was published 1993. There is no indication it contained any material from her lectures at the University of Frankfurt. It is puzzling that over 2 decades of additional material is ignored..
It would appear the intention of Harald Reiche to edit Hertha von Dechend's extensive German-language lecture notes, from lectures and seminars at Frankfurt University beginning 1970, was never fulfilled. He did make use of her unpublished material in at least one of his essays. It has been stated that Harald Reiche borrowed heavily from Hertha von Dechend. (Von Dechend appears to have left material from her MIT visits in Lettvin's care. What this might consist of is unknown. It appears likely that von Dechend left her lecture notes (and other similar papers?) to Jerome Lettvin as executor. (Von Dechend told Abe Aronow that she had left her [MIT] papers to Jerome Lettvin as executor.) These lecture notes have, to my knowledge, never been translated or made generally available.
Available - I think through the effort of Franz Krojer - is the brochure of her 1976/1977 seminar: Einführung in die Archaische Kosmologie. Vorlesungen im Wintersemester 1976/77 (Differenz-Verlag, München 2011). (Details: Hertha von Dechend, Einführung in die Archaische Kosmologie [Introduction to the Archaic Cosmology] Vorlesungen im Wintersemester 1976/77 [Lectures in Winter Semester 1976/77] Herausgegeben von Rainer Herbster [Edited by Rainer Herbster] Oder an: Differenz-Verlag Franz Krojer Postfach 90 03 15 81503 München.)
The library of Giorgio de Santillana also passed to Jerome Lettvin. (It would be interesting to know the content and size of the library he inherited.)
Hertha von Dechend's unfinished book



From the time of publication of Hamlet's Mill in 1969 (or, as one informed source indicates, even prior to its publication) Hertha von Dechend already had plans for a 2nd book and was busily collecting materials for it. The themes for the 2nd book involved/included the astro-mythological interpretation of the Pyramid Texts, the Amduat, and the Book of the Dead. (The ancient Egyptian Amduat or 'Book of What is in the Underworld' is the oldest of several funerary texts depicted on the walls of the pharaohs' tombs (i.e., in the tomb of Pharaoh Tuthmose (Tuthmosis) III) in the Valley of the Kings during the New Kingdom, on the burial chamber wall in the tomb of Tuthmose (Tuthmosis) II (near Thebes). (It has been claimed on Hastro-L (2012) that the manuscript is with the German publisher, Springer.) ) The Amduat was one of the first completely illustrated texts that defined what the Egyptian underworld was imagined to look like, and depicted the nightly journey of the sun god, Re through the twelve hours of the underworld.) Von Dechend believed that the astronomical knowledge and contributions of ancient Egypt had been under-estimated and up to her death was particularly interested in Erik Hornung's publication Das Amduat oder die Schrift des verborgenen Raumes (3 Band, 196367). However, it appears she only had 4 chapters completed (and ready for printing) by 1998. She procrastinated and never got around to completing the (final) 5th chapter (for MIT Press). (It appears she had an English title Archeoastronomy for the title of the draft manuscript. It also appears it was dated 1997. In 1998 she had delivered 4 completed chapters, ready for printing, to MIT Press but procrastinated over the 5th chapter on the constellation Sagittarius.) It appears she gave a lot of time to mythological material relating to the constellation Sagittarius. She also intended to continue with her particular philological approach - this time focusing on what she believed were deficiencies and false interpretations in the translations of the Gilgamesh epic and the Rig Veda.
Miscellaneous associates of Hertha von Dechend
From George Mason University's History News Network (http://hnn.us/roundup/54.html): "William H. McNeill is Robert A. Milikan Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Chicago. He taught at the university from 1947 until his retirement in 1987. McNeill is also a past president of the American Historical Association (1984-1985). McNeill has authored over thirty books ...." ... [McNeill writes (The Pursuit of Truth: A Historian's Memoir (2005)] "In 1955, Gustav von Grunebaum invited me to join him in a seminar at the University of Frankfurt, Germany. The seminar was conducted in German so I had to learn the language as never before, and during the three months I spent in Frankfurt a learned teaching assistant, Fraulein von Dechend guided me through pre-war German scholarship about pre-history and the history of steppe peoples." (McNeill is a Canadian-American historian. Life dates: 1917- .)
In the Preface to the 1993 edition of Hamlet's Mill Hertha von Dechend thanks, for their strong support and encouragement, Emma Duchane, Jayant Shah, Jerome Lettvin, Philip Morrison, and Harald Reiche. All were students/academics at MIT. (Hertha von Dechend occasionally spoke of Emma Duchane to Abe Aronow.)
Hertha von Dechend's written estate
Hertha von Dechend's written estate comprises some 40 hand-manageable boxes of papers kept at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität. No real work of investigation and analysis has yet commenced with these papers. See: Archivdatenbank, Frobenius-Institut: http://archive.today/e3KdJ
The support for Hamlet's Mill limited to MIT colleagues
At MIT the core 'members' of the so-called Experimental Epistemology Laboratory (the name originated with Jerome Lettvin as a joke) were a small cabal in their support and promotion of the ideas of de Santillana/von Dechend. Santillana/Dechend had strong support and encouragement from Emma Duchane, Jayant Shah, Jerome Lettvin, Philip Morrison, and Harald Reiche. All were students/academics at MIT. At the time of publication of the book by de Santillana/von Dechend the only favourable reviews were written by their academic friends at MIT, namely Philip Morrison and Harald Reiche.
The only real support for the book Hamlet's Mill came from certain faculty members of MIT who were associated with Giorgio de Santillana. One supporter reviewer described the book as "A brilliant speculative inquiry into the origins of scientific thought ...." See the sympathetic (Englishlanguage) book reviews by Philip Morrison (who described the book as Polemic [it is strongly polemical in style]) in Scientific American, Volume 221, Number 5, November, 1969, Page 159 (at which time he was the book review editor); and by Harald Reiche in The Classical Journal, Volume 69, Number 1, October/November, 1973, Pages 81-83; and by Carroll Quigley (historian and polymath; Professor of History at MIT) in The Washington Sunday Star, 25 January, 1970 ("Delving Into Linguistic Archaeology."). Harald Reiche was one of Hertha von Dechend's few academic exponents. (Giorgio de Santillana and Harald Reiche had previously jointly-authored the book Aristotle and Science: A Critical Controversy which was published in 1959. It also appears that they worked at least on the draft of an essay titled: "A Memorandum on Greek Science.") Philip Morrison (who also wrote the Introduction to Astronomy of the Ancients edited by Kenneth Brecher (a close friend of de Santillana? and Lettvin?) and Michael Feirtag (1979), was Professor of Physics at MIT, and Harald Reiche was Professor of Classics and Philosophy at MIT. ("A Clue to the Atlantis Myth?" by Harald Reiche included in Astronomy of the Ancients, a volume of essays by various (mostly MIT) authors, on mythology and ancient astronomy, is an updated version of an article originally published by Reiche in Technology Review (a MIT periodical).) (See also the (English-language) book review by Arthur Meadows (University of Leicester) in Ambix, Volume XIX, 1972, Page 220. Further, see the sympathetic (Estonian-language) book review by Heino Eelsalu in Akadeemia [an Estonian journal], Number 6, 1995 Pages (Columns?) 1300-1301. Heino Eelsalu (Life dates: 1930-1998) was an astronomer.) A sympathetic book review by Bernard de Voto appeared in Saturday Review, Volume 53, 1970, Pages 102-105. After the retirement of Giorgio de Santillana his history of science classes at MIT were continued by Harald Reiche, a Professor of Classics and Philosophy at MIT, who was an avid supporter of Hamlet's Mill. In 1960 Harald Reiche was promoted to Associate Professor, Department of Humanities. He stayed at MIT and progressed through to Professor and then Professor Emeritus. (After his retirement it appears Giorgio de Santillana continued to lecture at MIT until he became seriously ill.)
It is important to see who is writing book reviews, and make sure that at least they are actual experts in the field. It needs to be emphasised that peer-reviewer/reviewers should be scholars in the same field. Reviewer bias is a related issue (as is also reviewer ignorance). The review by Philip Morrison (a Professor at MIT and a friend of de Santillana and von Dechend) was rather a non-review which did not explain much and which did not address any of the problems that had been identified by other reviewers. Philip Morrison's book review seems to be an attempt to put the best face on it and not be too critical. Also, as Philip Morrison had no expertise in the particular fields not much weight can be given to his book review. Obviously both Reiche and Morrison were trying to do de Santillana/von Dechend a favour. There was obviously a "buddy system" in place at MIT. The fact of some journals choosing book reviewers from the same institution as the authors of the book is somewhat odd.
Regarding "A Clue to the Atlantis Myth?" by Harald Reiche, in Astronomy of the Ancients edited by Kenneth Brecher and Michael Feirtag (1979); see the earlier explanation in "Atlantis and Its Institutions." by Robert Brumbaugh in his book Plato's Mathematical Imagination (1977, Pages 4759). In this same book Jerome Lettvin analysed the myth of Perseus as a multi-levelled narration transmitting not only knowledge of the marine fauna of the Mediterranean but also astronomical information.



Harald Reiche was perhaps the most able supporter of Hamlet's Mill. Once Reiche reached the USA he spent most of his time at MIT. Regarding simple observation/observations methods for simply noticing effect change. In one of his publications ("The Language of Archaic Astronomy: A Clue to the Atlantis Myth?" In: Kenneth Brecher and Michael Feirtag (Editors). Astronomy of the Ancients (1979, Page 157).) There was an uncritical endorsement for the book by Carl Sagan proving he should have stuck to planetary astronomy: "A stirring mix of science, history, and myth illustrating the indomitable urge of our ancestors to understand the world.") Reiche introduces the 'grandfather/tree' argument in support of Hamlet's Mill. According to de Santillana/von Dechend the scientifically accurate rate of the precession was known in the late Neolithic Period (circa 4000 BCE). The tree and grandfather effect discovery would need to have been earlier. But there are other simple methods which don't require a tree and grandfather.Some considerable time after his death his copy of Robert Eisler's, Weltenmantel und Himmelszeit was able to be purchased by myself from a specialist dealer in used German-language books. It is clear that this book (described by one reviewer as phantasmagorical) was a strong influence on Reiche. He frequently annotated the pages. Hamlet's Mill mentions the book in high regard. Eisler's book, however, is somewhat messy.
Harald Reiche promoted Hamlet's Mill and its method. However, Harald Reiche's astronomical interpretation of the Atlantis myth is anything but convincing. Reiche argued that the Atlantis myth is an astronomical allegory and that the topography of Atlantis needs to be transferred to the sky to be understood. Writing in 1994 the ex-Velikovskian catatastrophist Leroy Ellenberger stated: "Had it not been for the masterful hegemony of Harald A. T. Reiche, Classicist at M.I.T., who impressed me with the validity of the wisdom revealed in HAMLET'S MILL, I would not be a "player" today; but I refuse to acquiesce to the Saturnists' delusion now that I see what the REAL possibilities are. Milton Zysman deserves credit for organizing a conference in Toronto in 1990, where Victor Clube, as the keynote speaker, put fire and brimstone into his "puny meteor shower model" making it a viable alternative to "right-running" Velikovskians ...." Since 1990 Leroy Ellenberger has actively promoted the comet catastrophism (Taurid Complex) model of Clube and Napier (first proposed in the early 1980s), which is now named "coherent catastrophism." The astronomer David Morrison has noted that the Clube/Napier model of catastrophism has attracted many people who were once impressed by Velikovsky's model of catastrophism.
Philip Morrison (1915–2005, a professor of physics at MIT) held continually to the views expressed in Hamlet's Mill. See: "Dissonance in the Heavens." by Philip Morrison in Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Volume 30, Number 2, November, 1976, Pages 26-36.
Others include: William Thompson (born 1938; academic; New Age proponent and 'alternative' thinker; mystic/occultist); Seyyed Nasr (born 1933 in Iran; academic; student of de Santillana; a prominent Islamic philosopher/mystic; currently Professor of Islamic studies at George Washington University); and Philip (Phil) Norfleet (born 15 August, 1941; now retired; student of de Santillana; a devotee of the nonsensical teachings and hilarious cosmology of George Gurdjieff (George Georgiades, 1872?-1949) and his disciple Petyr Ouspensky (1878-1947); mystic/occultist; in the late 1960s failed to complete his PhD in Computer Science and Business Administration at University of Colorado). (For a reasonable critique of George Gurdjieff as guru see: Feet of Clay by Anthony Storr (1997). Both Gurdjieff and Ouspensky and emerged from the folds of Helena Balavatsky's Theosophy movement. The Russian occultist, medium, and fraudster Helena Blavatsky (1831-1891) originated the Theosophical Society in New York in 1875.)
The later efforts by the British mathematician Richard Thompson to support the ideas in Hamlet's Mill is set out in the book Vedic Cosmography and Astronomy (1996). The book is weird. At present I have not seen his later book The Cosmology of the Bhagavata Purana (2007).
John Major Jenkins, a supporter of alternative history, is also a supporter of Hamlet's Mill, which he classes as archaeoastronomy. In attempting to support the book he writes (http://edj.net/mc2012/mill1.htm): "Although it [Hamlet's Mill] tottered on the edge of oblivion for years, it has reemerged as the fundamental inspiration for many progressive researchers who find the precession of the equinoxes lurking within ancient creation myths around the world."
Later support for Hertha von Dechend
After the death of de Santillana and the eventual cessation of visits to MIT by von Dechend, support for her ideas came from several academic colleges in Frankfurt. (Mainly, it appears, Walter Saltzer and Yas Maeyama.)
After the death of Giorgio de Santillana a staff member of Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität, Professor Dr Walter Saltzer, became a colleague of Hertha von Dechend. Walter Saltzer's key area of interest is the genesis and development of scientific ideas. Saltzer is the deputy-director of the Institute for the History of Science. See his slim book Theorien und Ansatze in der Griechischen Astronomie (1976, Pages viii, 162, Figures 38).
Draft translation of a comment by Prof. Yas Maeyama (a Professor in the Institute for History of Science, Goethe University, Frankfurt (Germany).): "As a senior member of the Institute of History of Natural Sciences, University of Frankfurt ... she [Hertha von Dechend] obtained an insight into the world of archaic myth previously not glimpsed by any human ...."
Von Dechend's contact with layperson proponents of Hamlet's Mill
Sepp Rothwangl, a German forester, was in occasional postal contact with von Dechend. The subject matter is unknown to me. (Copies are likely to be found in her archival material.)
Florence Wood and Kenneth Wood (the authors of, Homer's Secret Iliad: The Epic of the Night Skies Decoded (1999), based on possession of unpublished papers left by Edna Leigh, a school teacher, personally visited von Dechend in Germany to discuss their ideas. In August 1996 they visited the University of Frankfurt and met with von Dechend and 2 of her professional colleagues and gave them a preview of their claims for Homeric astronomy. A later letter of support and encouragement was received from von Dechend and Saltzer. In the Acknowledgments (Page ix) to their Homer's Secret Iliad they acknowledge their "appreciation of the interest and encouragement of Dr Hertha von Dechend ... and that of her colleague Dr Walter Saltzer." Note: The original source for Edna Leigh was perhaps Max Müller.
Biography of Harald Reiche
Harald Anton Thrap Olsen Reiche, Department of Humanities, MIT: Carnegie Fellow 1953; Assistant Professor of Classics and Philosophy 19551960; Associate Professor 1960-1966; Professor 1966-1991.
Harald Reiche (people often mispronounced his name) was born in Germany in February,1922 and died in Boston (USA) in July, 1994, aged 72 years. He studied in Switzerland before he emigrated to the USA in 1938. He obtained his AB, AM, and PhD, all in Classics, from Harvard University. His PhD was received in 1955. He was Professor of Classics and Philosophy at MIT from 1955 to 1991. He was a specialist in Greek philosophy and the Church fathers. (See the short obituary notice in Klio, Volume 83, Number 2, 2001, Page 467; also, The Tech, Volume 114, Number 32, 1994, Page 6.) His focus was Greek philosophy and cosmology and myth. His research and publications were chiefly in the area of Greek philosophy and science and their interface with mythology. At the time of his death he was Professor Emeritus, School of Humanities and



Social Science, History Faculty, MIT. The Harvard Alumni Bulletin, (Volume 54, Issue 2, 1951, Page 91) mentions: "Mr. and Mrs. Boris G. Bojenko of Paris and New York have announced the engagement of their daughter, Miss Irina Bojenko, to Harald AT Reiche, AM '44. Miss Bojenko [properly, Vojenko] is an alumna of Mauris Barres College [properly, Collège Maurice Barrès] in Paris." However, an obituary for Irene Reiche states they were, at the time of his death, married for 45 years. This gives a date of 1949. At least one biographical entry states they moved to Boston, and lived in Concord MA. Harald and Irene Reiche were Housemasters of Baker House, MIT, for 1980-1989. Victoria Reiche Gaar wrote: "Irene loved her years at Baker House and continued contact with many of the students throughout the years." After Harald Reiche's death Irene Reiche had moved to the Forum at Brookside in Louisville to be close to her daughter Victoria (Gaar). It appears that at the time of her death she was living at 46 Commonwealth Avenue, #8, Boston, MA. Irene Reiche, was born in France in 1927 and died in the USA on March 30, 2012, aged 85. The Reiche's are survived by 3 daughters, Elizabeth Reiche, Katharine Bigel and Victoria Gaar. (Note:: Elizabeth Joan Reiche (born in July 1954), known as Tita, died aged 61 years in November 2015, from a rare nasopharyngeal cancer that had metastasized. She was 61 years. Tita studied in the USA, Europe, and in Oxford, England where she learned to talk like a British teenager. Tita is survived by her two sisters, Victoria Gaar, of Louisville, Kentucky, and Katherine Bigel of Los Angeles, California, and brother Chris's widow, Lisa Deschenes of Arlington, Massachusetts.) There was a memorial service in Boston or Cambridge for Irene in early June 2012; her ashes are interred next to Harald's at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge. Some of his 'forgotten' books and articles include: Empedocles' Mixture, Eudoxan Astronomy and Aristotle's Connate (1960) (See the (English-language) book review by George Kerferd (University College, Swansea) in The Classical Review, (New Series), Volume 12, Issue 1, 1962, Pages 93-94); translator, 1953, Tragedy is not Enough by Karl Jaspers; and "Myth and Magic in Cosmological Polemics: Plato, Aristotle, Lucretius." in Rheinisches Museum, N.F., Band 114, 1971, Pages 296-321 (a study of astral myths in cosmological polemics). In the early 1960s Harald Reiche was one academic who advised Life magazine on the content for its new series of articles on ancient Greece, beginning with Volume 54, Number 1, January 4, 1963. Reiche was tending to make astral interpretations of material by the late 1940s. Reiche believed the earliest royal genealogies of, for example, Babylon, and Denmark, and the Greek kings of prehistory were astral and planetary in human pseudohistorical guise. Kings were in charge of their national calendars and so were 'influential' in celestial movements. He also located Atlantis high in the sky. He surveyed Greco-Roman traditions of decline and end – which he believed were based on the mythic patterns of the end of the world in prehistoric cultures and early ancient civilizations, involving notions of declining world ages - in "The Archaic Heritage: Myths of Decline and End in Antiquity." In: Visions of Apocalypse: End or Rebirth? edited by Saul Friedlander, Gerald Horton, Leo Marx, and Eugene Skolnikof (1985).
Also, Harald Reiche had a nice sense of humour. It also appears that - unlike de Santillana, von Dechend, and Lettvin - he was a non-smoker.
Obituary, August 17, 1994 issue of MIT Tech Talk (Volume 39, Number 2).: "Professor Harald Reiche dies. August 17, 1994. Services were held at Mount Auburn Cemetery July 29 for Professor Emeritus of History Harald A.T.O. Reiche, 72, who died on July 25. A classical scholar, Professor Reiche was the author or co-author of several books and many articles on classical history and thought. He became particularly interested in Greek cosmology and astronomy and wrote and lectured widely in that relatively unexplored field. Professor Reiche was born in Germany in 1922 and studied in Switzerland before emigrating to the United States where he was graduated from Phillips Academy. After service in the US Army during World War II, he received the AB degree in classics from Harvard in 1943. where he also received the AM (1944) and PhD (1955) degrees. He was appointed assistant professor of classics and philosophy at MIT in 1955 and helped to organize, design and teach the introductory humanities program. He also taught electives in Greek philosophy and language, ancient history and Roman political thought. He was promoted to associate professor in 1960 and to professor in 1966. He retired in 1991. In addition, from 1980-90, Professor Reiche and his wife were faculty residents in Baker House, where they hosted Sunday evening suppers and symposia famous on the campus for good food and stimulating conversation. Professor Reiche held a Carnegie Fellowship in humanities when he was first at MIT. Later he held a Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship in Athens and a Ford Foundation visiting professorship at the Technical University of Berlin. For many years he was also a lecturer in humanities and philosophy at Suffolk University. Professor Reiche is survived by his wife, Irene Vojenko Reiche of Boston; a son, Christopher Reiche of Arlington; three daughters, Elizabeth Riddle of Syracuse, NY, Katharine Bigel of Seattle, WA, and Victoria Reiche of Geneva, Switzerland, and three grandsons.

Obituary in The Boston Globe, April 1, 2012: "REICHE, Irene B. Of Boston's Back Bay, passed away in Louisville, Kentucky, surrounded by her loving family, on March 30, 2012, age 85, after a long struggle with pancreatic cancer. Irene Reiche (born in France) moved to Boston as a young bride to Prof. Harald Reiche of MIT (deceased). They lived in Concord, MA and brought up 4 children; Christopher Reiche (deceased), Elizabeth (Tita) Reiche of White River Junction, VT, Victoria Gaar of Louisville, KY, and Katharine Bigel of Marina del Rey, CA. They moved to Cambridge, MA, and served as Housemasters of MIT's Baker House for 10 years. They retired to Back Bay where Irene lived until 2011. [Her final residence was a Townhouse.] She was a loving grandmother to 4 grandsons and an active member of the First Church of Boston, Unitarian Universalist. Irene was a familiar figure walking her little white dog, "Mr. Bobby", in Boston Public Garden." Also, obituary published in The Boston Globe on 3/1/2009: "REICHE, Christopher G.T.

Reiche seems to have mostly published articles, and only one monograph (short book), Empedocles' Mixture, Eudoxan Astronomy and Aristotle's Connate (1960). He was co-author of several books. Regarding Reiche's competence as a Classicist. See the critical/scathing review by Friedrich Solmsen (Cornell University) of Reiche's 1960 book, Empedocles' Mixture, Eudoxan Astronomy and Aristotle's Connate Pneuma, with an Appendix "General because First" A Presocratic Motif in Aristotle's Theology. (The American Journal of Philology, Volume 84, Number 1, January, 1963, Pages 91-94.)
Harald Reiche's written estate
Richard Flavin informs me that Harald Reiche has an archive box – Collection Number MC480 – held at the (MIT libraries) Institute Archives & Special Collections (likely Hayden library). Presently the contents are a matter of speculation but perhaps contain unpublished articles (including unpublished co-authored articles).
Harald Reiche's position on ancient mythology
Harald Reiche was one of the few academic supporters and exponents of the views of Hertha von Dechend. There is every reason to believe he followed her ideas in his own publications.
As example of Reiche's position on mythology see further the article summary: "Epigraphic Society Occasional Papers, Table of Contents, Volume 24, 2004, Article: The Language of Ancient Astronomy – A Clue to the Atlantis Myth? (21 pp) Harald A. T. Reiche 24-p 245. It is clear that Stone



Age man lacked our mathematical systems and computational techniques and the knowledge of writing. It is equally clear, however, that he was able to raise Stonehenge and similar structures which involved precise measurements and celestial alignments. Reiche seeks to explain how they did it –what they used in lieu of technical language. He finds his answer in the vast storehouse of formulaic phrases (illustrated in the works of Homer). It is suggested that the form in which Neolithic and Bronze Age astronomers explained and transmitted knowledge was rhythmic (i.e., metric and versified speech), perhaps coupled with melody and elaborately styled pantomime. Reiche draws heavily on the work of Hertha von Dechend. He identifies 4 corollaries which define the method: 1) the mythological motif of successive world ages; 2) the mythological motif of monstrous deeds followed by "catastrophes," usually floods or fires or both; 3) the association of each world age with a planetary ruler (i.e., one of the naked-eye planets); and 4) the consensus, virtually universal among ancients that the "true" identity of a foreign deity can be deduced from its attributes. In the remainder of the article, the author reconsiders Plato's Atlantis myth in the light of the above corollaries. He identifies Plato's Atlantis myth as a piece of sacred cosmology deliberately expressed in pseudohistorical and pseudogeographic terms familiar from "mythic" language in its ancient capacity as a technical shorthand for astronomical systems"
Harald Reiche, in the last article in the special issue of Technology Review that was devoted to archeoastronomy pursues a similar theme to Lettvin's concept. Harald Reiche also supported the idea that what we now express in technical, scientific language was once conveyed by myth, perhaps including melody, stylized pantomime and dances. (See: Technology Review, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Volume 80, Number 2, December 1977.)
For Reiche, as well as de Santillana, and von Dechend, the language of myth is technical and thus accurate language. Reiche also supported early knowledge of precession before Hipparchus. According to Harald Reiche, the iconography of Iranian vases from 4000 BCE is demonstratively unintelligible except in terms of quasi-precessional phenomena. (See: Harald Reiche, "The Archaic Heritage: Myths of Decline and End in Antiquity." In: Saul Friedlander et. al. (Editors). Visions of Apocalypse: End or Rebirth (1985, Pages 21-43).
Regarding Reiche's uneven competence as a Classicist. See the critical/scathing review by Friedrich Solmsen (Cornell University) of Reiche's
1960 book, Empedocles' Mixture, Eudoxan Astronomy and Aristotle's Connate Pneuma, with an Appendix "General because First" A Presocratic Motif in Aristotle's Theology.
Reiche and Eisler's, Weltenmantel und Himmelszelt
Reiche was perhaps the most able supporter of Hamlet's Mill. Following his death his copy of Weltenmantel und Himmelszelt:
Religionsgeschichtliche Untersuchungen zur Urgeschichte des Antiken Weltbilds by Robert Eisler (1910, 2 Volumes) was able to be obtained by me. The authors of Hamlet's Mill held it in high regard. It is clear that this book was also a strong influence on Reiche. Copious handwritten notes are frequently scribbled on the page margins, as well as frequent underlining of text. It is undoubtedly an interesting collection of material. Eisler's two volumes have been called "highly valuable as phantasmagorias of uncritically used material." The entire volume 1 contains a great mass of material for the heavenly garment (i.e., astral symbols on garments) worn by royalty in ancient and medieval times, as well as by a great number of gods in ancient religion and on into Christianity. Volume 2 presents a similar body of material from sources of all sorts on the vault of heaven as a religious symbol. See the (English-language) book review by Francis Burkitt in The Classical Review, Volume XXV, 1911, Pages 145-147; and the (French-language) book review by Ed[?]. L[?]. in L'Année Sociologique, Tome XII 1909-1912, 1913, Pages 260-266.
The impact of Hamlet's Mill on the teaching of Polynesian studies
Hamlet's Mill had an impact on the teaching of Polynesian studies. The influential figure Rubellite Johnson incorporated belief in the themes of Hamlet's Mill into her courses and writings. From 1967 to 1993 she was on the faculty of the University of Hawaii-Manoa (Department of IndoPacific Languages) and helped establish its Hawaiian studies program. On retirement she became Professor Emeritius of Hawaiian Language and Literature and continued to publish. She researched the history of the Kumulipo, a sacred chant of Hawaiian mythology, and early newspapers in the Hawaiian language. See her course study book MO'OLELO HAWAI'I, WORLD OF THE HAWAIIANS (1993), page 116. In it she misidentifies the authors of Hamlet's Mill. On page 116, when discussing Hamlet's Mill, she mistakenly writes: "*Note: Hertha von Dechend was science historian at Harvard University; Giorgio Santillana (sic) was mathematic professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology." See also her book The Kumulipo Mind: A Global Heritage In The Polynesian Creation Myth (2000), page 179. In her book with John Mahelona, Na Inoa Hoku: A Catalogue of Hawaiian and Pacific Star Names (1975) the authors attempt to gather together the fragmentary record of Oceanic star knowledge. The main body of the book comprises 3 annotated lists of star names: Hawaiian, Pacific, and Indo-European. The authors are out of their depth when dealing with Egyptian, European, and Near Eastern star lore. In these areas they can be completely unreliable through uncritically accepting dated popular material.
The influence of Hamlet's Mill on student studies at MIT
Sally Weber, in her thesis (Sunlight and the Use of Holographic Diffraction Grating: An Environmental Perspective) for the degree of Master of Science in Visual Studies at MIT, June 1983, uses fanciful astronomical ideas from Hamlet's Mill in the confidence they are reliable. Earlier, Elizabeth Cavicchi, in her thesis (Arethusa: A Fountain through Sculpture) for the degree of Master of Science in Visual Studies at MIT, June 1980, writes approvingly (pages 11-12) of the ideas in Hamlet's Mill.
The disappearing influence of Hamlet's Mill
Giorgio de Santillana died in 1974. Harald Reiche died in 1994. Hertha von Dechend died in 2001. Jerome Lettvin died in 2011. The last MIT seminar given by Hertha von Dechend was in 1979. In the last 3 decades of her life von Dechend lectured in Frankfurt, and published almost nothing. After her retirement in 1980?/1982 she continued to hold seminars in private premises for a small group of about 8 participants. The location for these seminars was often the living room of the home of the Volhard family. At Frankfurt she had her ideas on ancient cosmology supported by Walter Saltzer and Yas Maeyama. There is really no active inheritance of her ideas remaining within the university system. Some academics in isolation use variations of the ideas in Hamlet's Mill but they are perhaps closer to the ideas of the German star myth school. The ideas of Hamlet's Mill are perhaps to be seen as an academic anomaly fuelled by particular chance circumstances.
Part 2: The Basic Argument: A Critical Overview
Key claims include: (1) All the world's mythologies are drawn from a common historical source; (2) This cultural source had a sophisticated knowledge of astronomy, including precession; (3) The myths originally drawn from a common historical source (somewhere in the Near East) contained a common body of astronomical knowledge; and (4) The zodiac as we know it originated circa 5000 BCE. The authors of Hamlet's Mill are not: (1) Particularly concerned with trying to date the original discovery of precession, but consider 5000 BCE to be the most likely date; or (2) Particularly concerned to try and identify the culture which originated the astronomy and mythology. Their concern was to establish historical evidence of a monomyth and its astronomical nature. Broadly, there was a complex culture invented only once, "somewhere in the Near East," and spread from there.



Key issues are: (1) How can diffusion be distinguished from independent invention? (2) How can the astronomical content of mythology (if it exists) be identified?
According to Hamlet's Mill an early intellectual elite in the Neolithic Near East, through their astronomical rigor, experienced the cosmos as unstable; they identified the precession of the equinoxes as disturbing its order. The anxieties created by this realisation, or rather interpretation, were expressed in myths of inevitable cosmic catastrophes (loss of order, i.e., shifting north pole star) and restorations of order. This is similar to Eduard Stucken (Astralmythen) maintaining that an astral theory of the universe is not the outcome of popular thought, but the result of a lengthy process of speculative reasoning carried on in restricted learning circles.
The basic argument is myth was the technical language of the archaic period 4000-3000 BCE, primarily for precessional phenomena. Based on her Polynesian studies, Hertha von Dechend interpreted early world-wide myths as having 3 rules: (1) animals are stars, (2) gods/goddesses are planets, and (3) topographic references are metaphors for locations - usually of the sun - on the celestial sphere. (See, for example Hamlet's Mill, Pages viii, and 62-65.) For Hamlet's Mill the Neolithic Period is both an age of mystery and an age of greatness during which formidable intellectual ability was demonstrated by a small group of people in the Near East by their establishment of mathematical calculus, careful observation of stellar movement leading to their discovery of precession, establishment of the equally divided 12-constellation zodiac, and development of a network of myths with common features. At the core of Hamlet's Mill is the claim that precession was not even an independently discovered and shared experience amongst cultures but discovered by a particular group of intellectuals ("Protopythagoreans") the Neolithic Near East and the discovery transmitted by them, coded in the 'technical language' of myth, over vast geological distances, before the establishment of writing. However, the primary centre of invention was not identified and proved by the authors and is yet to be proved by proponents of the ideas in the book. Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend believed they had found (and demonstrated) an underlying coherence behind hundreds of apparently chaotic sagas and myths. (Their focus was on cultural (i.e., mythological) material.) In order to do this they assume an historical relationship between world-wide myths. They make no attempt at all to demonstrate this assumption. They proposed a single astronomical origin in the ancient Near East for the entire global corpus of mythologies, including those of the Americas. Their basic method is to present comparative motifs between myths. This parallels/copies Eduard Stucken's method underlying his Astralmythen (5 parts) which was to define myths by their motifs, not by persons or types, and maintained that as it was motifs that were passed from people to people then only motifs could be used for the purposes of comparison. The method makes it easier to claim parallels and as such lacks rigour.
A motif is a small narrative unit recurrent in tales. The same motif in different cultures may hold vastly different meanings.
The authors promote the concept of an archaic high culture in the Near East. "The main thesis of the book is that at a remote period [preceding the civilizations of Babylonia, Egypt, India, and China] a few men discovered the precession of the equinoxes (usually attributed to Hipparchus, ca. 120 B.C.) the obliquity of the ecliptic, and the shifting of the Celestial Pole. Four points of reference (equinoxes and solstices) form the frame or true ground of all myth. In particular, all Flood, world destruction, and succession type myths are seen as due to the shifting of this frame (as the vernal equinox enters a new zodiac sign precessing along the ecliptic). The authors further contend that this essentially scientific information was put into the preliterate code language (p. 344) of myth which then made its way about the earth apparently from "that 'Proto-Pythagorean' mint somewhere in the Fertile Crescent. (p. 311), ... completely unaffected by local beliefs and customs (p.345)." (Gerald Gresseth in Journal of American Folklore, Volume 84, Number 332, April/June, 1971, Pages 246-247.) (The foundation of the theory of Panbabylonism was the claim for an early date for scientific astronomy in Babylonia. This entailed knowledge of precession of the equinoxes and a system of astronomical/astrological 'World Ages.') This point goes to the heart of the credibility of Hamlet's Mill. It is assumed by the authors of Hamlet's Mill that this diffusion of coded astronomical knowledge successfully proceeded, literally world-wide in a standardised manner, without continual contact and interaction by the originators, to more distant cultures! Also, there were no problems with the precessional knowledge being understood by any of these ancient cultures world-wide, even when they lacked the observational experience or framework of thinking! There are no examples of confusion (misinterpretation) or rejection.
Geometry and Algebra in Ancient Civilizations by Bartel van der Waerden (1948, 1983), and the critical book review "The Geometer and the Archaeoastronomers: On the Prehistoric Origins of Mathematics." by Wilbur Knorr (The British Journal for the History of Science, Volume 18, Number 2, July, 1985, Pages 197-212). Waerden (influenced by Abraham Seidenberg (1916-1988), Professor of Mathematics, University of California, Berkeley, retired 1987) speculates that the primary tradition arose within the Neolithic culture of Indo-European peoples who migrated into Central and Northern Europe in the 4th- and 3rd-millennium BCE. Specifically, a single Indo-European group, the so-called 'Beaker people' in the 3rd-millennium BCE, were the primal source for the geometric and ritual traditions, extending from Europe and the Near-East to India and China. In an article in ANTIQUITY (1997) Euan MacKie again argued for his long-standing belief that there existed in later Neolithic Britain and Ireland theocractic elites who possessed precise and sophisticated astronomical and mathematical knowledge. However, see the capable critique, "Cosmology, calendars and society in Neolithic Orkney: a rejoinder to Euan MacKie." by Clive Ruggles and Gordon Barclay (ANTIQUITY, Volume 74, Number 283, 2000, Pages 62-74); and "Will the data drive the model? A further response to Euan MacKie." by Gordon Barclay and Clive Ruggles (ANTIQUITY, Volume 76, Number 293, 2002, Pages 668-671).
See also the recent (ultimately) speculative article: Kainzinger, Albert. (2011). "The mathematics in the structures of Stonehenge." (Archive for the History of Exact Science, Volume 65, January, Issue 1, Pages 67-97). [Note: Abstract: "The development of ancient civilizations and their achievements in sciences such as mathematics and astronomy are well researched for script-using civilizations. On the basis of oral tradition and mnemonic artifacts illiterate ancient civilizations were able to attain an adequate level of knowledge. The Neolithic and Bronze Age earthworks and circles are such mnemonic artifacts. Explanatory models are given for the shape of the stone formations and the ditch of Stonehenge reflecting the circular and specific non-circular shapes of these structures. The basic mathematical concepts are Pythagorean triangles, thus adopting the construction procedures of the Neolithic circular ditches of Central Europe in the fifth Millennium bc and later earthworks and stone circles in Britain and Brittany. This knowledge was extended with new elliptical concepts. Approximations for the values of π and the square root of 2 are encoded in the henge. All constructions were performed using a standardized "Babylonian" metrology that shows a remarkable consistency and comprehensible development over some 14 centuries."] This paper is an extension of what may be termed the Waerden/Seidenbery thesis. See: "The Ritual Origin of Geometry." by Abraham Seidenberg (Archive for History of Exact Sciences, Volume 1, 1962, Pages 488-527); "The Ritual Origin of Counting." by Abraham Seidenberg Archive for History of Exact Sciences, Volume 2, 1962, Pages 1-40); "The Origin of Mathematics." by Abraham Seidenberg (Archive for History of Exact Sciences, Volume 18, 1978, Pages 301-342); "The Ritual Origin of the Circle and Square." by Abraham Seidenberg (Archive for History of Exact Sciences, Volume 25, 1981, Pages 269–327); and "A Neolithic Oral Tradition for the van der Waerden/Seidenberg Origin of Mathematics." by Jerold Matthews (Archive for History of Exact Sciences, Volume 34, Issue 3, 1985, Pages 193-220).
As stated above: The influence of Higgins' concept of an ancient world-wide secret religious order sharing knowledge, on the similar idea expressed in Hamlet's Mill that a secret world-wide net of scholars existed and shared coded astronomical information should not be overlooked.
According to de Santillana, throughout history the most advanced scientific knowledge is grasped only by a handful of people. My only comment is why didn't the channels of communication - whatever they supposedly were - also get used to carry other technical information such as



metalworking. Why the ready diffusion of precession but not the diffusion of other more valuable and practical cultural items? Also, what was the rate and method of spread? (Salt and tobacco are 2 trade items that encourage diffusion. However, they are never mentioned. It is worth noting that tobacco use literally diffused around the world within 100 years of the European discovery of the American continent.)
"[I]t is claimed that the widespread symbol of the World Tree must be based on the 'world axis', while the two great circles of the equinoxes and the solstices are represented by the image of the World Mill. Yggdrasil, Samson's pillar, the tree up which Mani climbs to heaven in the Polynesian story - all are reflections of man's early knowledge of the starry sky, based on a close and systematic observation of the movements of the heavens. The idea of a succession of worlds, of the destruction of the earth by Flood or fire, and many stories of the fall of great kings and heroes, are based on the disappearance of the Pole Star and its replacement by another, due to the phenomenon known as the Precession of the Equinoxes (described pp. 59 ff.)." (Hilda Davidson in Folklore, Volume CXXXV, 1974, Pages 282-283.)
Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend believed the astronomical content of myth preceded shamanism. Florence and Kenneth Wood, the authors of Homer's Secret Iliad (1999), mention that in the 1960s Edna Wood (who initially developed the idea of an astronomical code in the Iliad) received supportive letters from Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend at MIT, for her astronomical interpretation of the Iliad. Later (in 1996), Florence and Kenneth Wood mention that they visited Hertha von Dechend at the University of Frankfurt and received support for their ideas on Homeric astronomy from both Hertha von Dechend and Walter Saltzer. This enables some insight into what ideas and dates both de Santillana and von Dechend were prepared to accept. Though the book apparently lacks a wholly clear position on constellation origins (but the thrust is evident in Chapter 1 (see especially page 2) for implying a system of astronomy and constellations thousands of years prior to Homer) see page 244 regarding the suggestion for the origin of the constellations as early as the eighth millennium BCE. See also pages 207-208, 212, 217, & 220 for the reliance on a system of early zodiacal constellations stretching back to the eighth millennium BCE.
According to de Santillana and von Dechend (1) the scientifically accurate rate of the precession was known in the late Neolithic Period (circa 4000 BCE), (2) the precession is the main source of all the major myths of the world (and these myths spread from a common source in the ancient Near East), and (3) these myths represent preliterate science (are a preliterate scientific and technical language) and deal with the precession and the cosmology of celestial dimensions. They believed that all so-called 'high cultures' had myths based on precession. Changeovers in zodiacal signs, i.e., shift of vernal equinox due to precession, are described in terms of catastrophes. The astronomical phenomenon of precession was conceived as causing the rise and cataclysmic fall of the ages of the world.
De Santillana and von Dechend believed myth was the only technical language in archaic times. In seeking to uphold their explanation of the cryptic nature of the language of myths Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend claim that the language of myth was from the very beginning intended to be understood by initiates as compendia of cosmological teachings. "The main merit of this language is its ambiguity. Myth can be used as a vehicle for handing down solid knowledge independently from the degree of insight of the people who do the actual telling of the stories, fables, etc. In ancient times, moreover, it allowed members of the archaic "brains trust" to "talk shop" unaffected by the presence of laymen: the danger of giving something away was practically nil. (Hamlet's Mill, 1969, Page 312)." (Amazingly, the need for secrecy is simply assumed and never explained. No material/discussion in Hamlet's Mill concerned with the issue of religious/scientific secrecy in archaic societies. Also, the assumption of an 'international club' of people 'in the know' and storytellers who were not, but none-the-less ensured these particular myths dominated and never changed the essential structure of the supposedly coded information is simply assumed and never explained. Also, why the precessional knowledge set that was kept so secret was never again rediscovered in a repeat process by other persons, and again coded, is left in silence. The use of material from the literary period of China (by David Pankenier and Deborah Porter) as examples for verifying Hamlet's Mill remain late examples of astronomy being placed into myth (by only a few persons), and also culturally limited examples.)
The complexity of the 'code'
"And yet: this shell trumpet is one tiny 'subject', one among hundreds and thousands of the 'code', and one about which we could know something, if we only really wanted to know." (Introduction to Ancient Cosmology by Hertha von Dechend (1966, Page 139.) There is no mention of code within the Index of Hamlet's Mill (1969). It is puzzling why no attempt was made to straightforwardly list some of the content of the supposed 'code.' Also, any discussion about its supposed complexity is not attempted. The attempts to explain aspects of numerology as code have been unsuccessful/unconvincing.
In her 1966 student notes (Page VI) for Introduction to Ancient Cosmology, some clarification is given. "[The code] formulae ... cover[s] facts, astronomical, arithmetical, geometrical, alchemical, metrological, and harmonic facts."
The authors of Hamlet's Mill make no concerted attempt to gather in a single chapter all that they believe they have uncovered of the supposed content of the complex monomyth and how they believe its explanative form was originated. The whole focus of the book is mainly a scattered attempt across the book to claim what they believe are its adaptions/remanants/corruptions. But nothing about the believed structure and believed content of the monomyth is gathered together in a summary form in a single chapter.
A complicated system of astral mythology is simply Panbabylonism.
Oral transmission of a complex 'code'
The assumption is made by the authors of Hamlet's Mill - through a basic comparative method underpinned by the concept of stimulus diffusion that oral tradition can be and is a trustworthy carrier of ancient beliefs and customs, and knowledge. The issue of the dependability of oral transmission is never really discussed. The issue of transmission errors is not discussed. Can a complex astronomical code be successfully transmitted across time and space between different cultures? Neither do the authors concern themselves with the mechanisms of oral transmission. They simply isolate a number of themes - or make an interpretation - and argue they are remnants of more ancient themes forming a complex code. There is also lack of discussion of degeneration or preservation theories of oral transmission. Those persons who uphold the theory of degeneration and those persons who emphasise the reliability of oral transmission are basically in opposing camps. The debate still exists and is an important one. The trustworthiness of oral transmission affects how successfully a complex astronomical code can be transmitted over time. It puts their ideas to the test.
Apparently the monomyth is never rejected, nor does it have any competition with other tales.
An imagined example of unchanging oral transmission from the Paleolithic period
"Twentieth-century literary critic Roland Barthes (as cited in Czarniawska-Joerges, 2004) observed that "narrative is present in every age, in every place, in every society; it begins with the very history of mankind and there nowhere is nor has been a people without narrative" (p. 1). Given movie depictions of Cro-Magnons as linguistically challenged savages, it may be hard to imagine the Stone Age men who walked across the Bering land bridge to populate North America during the last ice age as tellers of stories. But evidence in support of Barthes' claim might be found



in the stars. Bradley Schaefer's grandfather taught him to identify the "big bear" constellation, Ursa Major, in the Colorado sky, no doubt setting the stage for his career in astronomy. Now, Schaefer (2006) argues that the history of Ursa Major can only be explained with reference to "a chain of grandfathers stretching from Paleolithic Siberia to the mountains and plains of the New World and eventually to modern Colorado, telling about the Bear in the sky" (p. 97). The story of constellations, as we have come to understand it, begins in the Fertile Crescent (stretching across Iraq, Syria, and adjoining lands). Thousands of years before humans walked to the New World, our ancestors lived by farming along the banks of great rivers—the Tigris and the Euphrates. From time to time the river would flood, washing away possessions and jeopardizing lives, but also depositing nutrient-rich silt that would support crops. Hardwired to identify patterns, humans eventually noticed that the movements of stars across the sky could be used to predict the coming flood. As is so often the case with great discoveries, this insight probably did not arrive as a single "aha!" moment, more likely occurring to several people in different locations at different times. Each one developed a method for recognizing the stars and each one developed a story to help identify those stars and describe their movement to younger generations. The easiest way to describe a cluster of stars was to point up and say, "See those stars that look like a big ladle, like a Big Dipper? Now see how these other stars trace the outline of a bear followed by three hunters?" So it is not surprising that the humans who made their way to the New World took with them their most memorable stories. And it is therefore not surprising that, as Schaefer and others have observed, the stars that make up Ursa Major are described as a bear by Old World traditions of Greek, Basque, Hebrew, and Siberian tribes as well as the New World cultures of the Cherokee, Algonquin, Zuni, Tlingit, and Iroquois. The history of constellations is the history of man's earliest storytelling, and it illustrates the life-giving role that stories play in the transfer of knowledge." (Barusch, Amanda. (2012). "Narrative Gerontology Coming Into Its Own." (Journal of Gerontological Social Work, Volume 55, Number 1, Pages 1-4; Pages 1-2.)
Note: There is no common source for the recognition of constellations across ancient cultures.
The collapse or end of the claimed universal system
How and when this world-wide common technical language eventually lost its use and fell into disuse (i.e., became simply debris) is not adequately discussed in Hamlet's Mill. They do write, however (Page 345): "With the remnants of the system scattered all over the world, abandoned to the drift of cultures and languages, it is immensely difficult to identify the original themes that may have undergone so many seachanges." Their basic position is that ancient myths are the remains of preliterate astronomy that became lost (at least in Western Europe) with the rise of Greco-Roman civilisation. Perhaps their perception was that since the Greeks the language we commonly use for science and scientific description, and mythology, have developed separately. However this viewpoint was not true for George St. Clair. He upheld that astronomical mythology was quite evident during the duration of Greco-Roman civilisation. "Mr. George St. Clair challenges every attempt ever made to explain the mythology of Greece and Rome, and he offers an explanation of his own. He does not take the myths literally; nor does he believe in the human explanation of Euhemerus, nor again in the explanation identifying the myths with the phenomena of the natural world, nor in Andrew Lang's folklore theory. Mr. St. Clair believes that Greek and Roman mythology was based upon astronomy and the calendar. The signs of the zodiac, the planets, the Pleiades, and the stars generally are in it." (The Ecclesiastical Review, Volume 31, 1904, Page 624 (637?).)
The authors of Hamlet's Mill claim (Page 347): "It would be possible, for example, to prepare a most informative edition of the Romance of Reynard Fox illustrated entirely with reproductions from Egyptian and Mesopotamian ritual documents. For it is likely that these documents represent the last form of international initiatic language, intended to be misunderstood alike by suspicious authorities and the ignorant crowd." It is another interesting claim that has no examples and/or references given for it. In an exchange on Hastro-L in June 2013 one Hamlet’s Mill enthusiast successfully wrote: (1) "HVD is alluding to Brunelstraat (Milky Way) and the myth of a fox stealing corn from a mill. Think also of Fernis wolf. of (sic) his mouth comes a river of slobber forming milky way." (2) "HVD is alluding to Brunelstraat (Milky Way) and the myth of a fox stealing corn from a mill. PS: and (sic) of corse (sic) to the jackal-headed God Anubis. you (sic) find the jackal also at the center of the round dendera (sic) zodiac." (3) "... you will find in Hamlet's Mill at least four times the word jackal: e.g. p. 406. Particularly obvious is the case in Egypt, where we learn from H. Kees (Der Gotterglaube im Alten Agypten [1956J, p. 193, n. 3): "wtw means 'jackal' and 'the eldest,' " and it happens that Kees made this remark when dealing with a classical case of cheating: when Geb/Kronos declared Horus the eldest, cutting out Seth/Typhon completely, as reported in the Shabaka Inscription. "Actually Geb claims Horus to be Upuaut, the Opener of the Way - Upuaut being the Upper Egyptian Jackal or Wolf." also (sic) app 2. p 358: but there the arrow is shorter and aims at Sirius, the celestial Jackal, whereas the same Egyptian arrow is aimed at the star on the head of the Sothis Cow, as depicted in the so-called "Round Zodiac" of Dendera-Sirius again. and (sic) see also the image on p 216: Drawing the bow at Sirius, the celestial jackal."
My response (Hastro-L, 19-6-2013): "I think you mean to say the authors - like yourself - offer no examples/references for the claim: "It would be possible, for example, to prepare a most informative edition of the Romance of Reynard Fox illustrated entirely with reproductions from Egyptian and Mesopotamian ritual documents." You are [effectively] claiming page 347 is alluding partly to page 248: "... the old Dutch name for the Galaxy, "Brunelstraat." Brunel, Bruns, Bruin (the Brown) is the familiar name of the bear in the romance of Reynard the Fox, and is as ancient as anything that can be traced." In the reinvention of history by Dean Clarke (Archaeo-Astronometria; 2008, Page 56) he states: "The ancient Dutch call the Milky Way Brunelstraat, after Brunel, a thieving fox." (You have the same on your website and in your book. You give Hamlet's Mill as your reference, but no page.) Nothing here that involves "reproductions from Egyptian and Mesopotamian ritual documents." Also, I expect you will give the exact details for "Brunel, a thieving fox." The myth of the fox stealing corn from a mill. Which Old World myth specifically? Will it involve: "reproductions from Egyptian and Mesopotamian ritual documents."? So far, nothing. I am familiar with New World versions of a dog or a wolf stealing corn from a mill. The word "jackal" does not appear in the Index of Hamlet's Mill. No matter, a jackal is not a fox. See, for example: http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-fox-and-vs-jackal/. The medieval tale is the Romance of Reynard the Fox, not the Romance of Reynaud the Jackal. So, this is definitely not evidence of any merit. Also, once again, nothing here that involves "reproductions from Egyptian and Mesopotamian ritual documents." Presently you have not been able to provide any Egyptian or Mesopotamian example. Nor does Hamlet's Mill."

Note: With changes to cultural and social circumstances over time why did so many generations of 'peasants' all over the world, some 200 generations counting 20 years as a generation, retain/repeat mythological stories that were not comprehensible to them? Why did they all do it?
Why no conversion from technical myth to plain explanation?
For von Dechend the supposed structure of the preliterate Ur-myth involved the following 6 features at least: (1) astronomy, (2) arithmetic, (3) geometry, (4) alchemy, (5) metrology, and (6) harmonics. All these subjects throughout the world all belong to/derive from an Urtext.



According to Santillana/Dechend this world-wide common technical language eventually lost its use and fell into disuse (i.e., became simply debris) (at least in Western Europe) with the rise of Greco-Roman civilisation. Perhaps their perception was that since the Greeks the language we commonly use for science and scientific description, and mythology, have developed separately.
However, with the rise of alphabetic writing in the 2nd-millennium BCE why was the compliant features not 'translated'/converted from myth into more readily accessible 'plain' scientific terminology. To maintain that supposed secrecy provisions still held explains nothing. If by the time of Greek-Roman civilization the Ur-myth was disintegrating then it was no longer a maintained system of information. Other means of saving/maintaining the information must surely have been considered.
The claim for a monomyth
The claim is the monomyth no longer exist in anything like its original form/integrity. The original form has to be teased out of remaining/surviving remnants that survive sporadically in myths, chronicles, etc.
The central claim of Hamlet's Mill is precession was known some 5000 years before Hipparchus' discovery and this knowledge was disseminated throughout the world in a monomyth. However, de Santillana and von Dechend were not concerned with attempting to date their claim for the original discovery of precession. Nor were they concerned with attempting to assign their claim for the original discovery of precession to a lost civilization (known or unknown). They indicated their belief that all myths by at least the Neolithic period (or earlier Paleolithic period) were shared across the continents. had a common historic origin in a monomyth originating in the Near East. Their focus was their claim that all the world's mythologies originated from a common historical source – a monomyth – which contained a body of astronomical information centred on knowledge of the precession of the equinoxes. Mundane adventure stories are the coded means for transmitting information concerning the precession of the equinoxes. (Also, produced within this coded story was a sign code for the stars i.e., the stars of Ursa Major became a team of oxen.) The term monomyth originated with Joseph Campbell and means a single mythic tradition underlying all the known discrete mythic traditions. Strictly, Campbell proposed a heroic monomyth. This is different to the Urmyth/monomyth proposed by the authors of Hamlet's Mill.
Note: The authors of Hamlet's Mill argue for the existence of a global human culture in prehistoric times. For some this means the Palaeolithic world of 50,000 years ago.
The idea of a monomyth contradicts what is evident about mythology. That is myths carry a tremendous amount of cultural content. The entire worldview of a society, its values and highest aspirations, are encoded in myth. This value-content is unique to each culture's mythology. Simply focusing on the things that are similar between all cultures involves ignoring the specific and unique cultural content of myth.
"But phenomenological parallels are liable to be elusive. If an expression, an image, or a particular idea is found in two different places, in two civilizations and religions, it does not follow that they mean the same, even if there is a direct historical borrowing or influence on one side or the other. Each detail obtains its significance from the whole structure in which it has been incorporated, and of which it is a part. It is not first of all a question of proving that this or that Israelite idea is also found in Babylonia or Egypt or has been 'borrowed' from there. The essential question is, what significance has been imparted to it in its new context; what has the religion of Israel made of it?" (The Psalms in Israel's Worship by Sigmund Mowinckel (2 Volumes, 1967) Pages 56-57.)
David Leeming identifies 3 main types of myths: (1) Creation, (2) Deities, and (3) Hero. Perhaps Trickster myths could have been included as a 4th type.
Part of the issue is whether ancient myths are based on observations of natural phenomena (as opposed to psychological observations), are easily invented, and whether oral myths can change quite quickly. (Interestingly, the later (literate) Romans abandoned their Etruscan heritage and adopted Greek mythology. Greek mythology is a 'local mythology' in its geographical setting and time-wise is set in the period of Mycenaean Greece circa 1550-1060 BCE; but its themes originated approximately 2000 years earlier. On the whole, Greek mythology had little connection with the celestial bodies.)
Also, did nearly every ancient culture around the planet really care about specific celestial movements of the kind posited in Hamlet's Mill? Was precession really the most important thing for so many ancient cultures? Why the claimed Neolithic precessional monomyth readily diffused around the world has not been explained.
Another issue: According to the authors of Hamlet's Mill myth/folklore descends from the 'intelligentsia' to the 'peasantry.' The oddness is: What existed in the way of stories before the supposed acceptance of the monomyth?
The term monomyth
The term monomyth does not appear in Hamlet's Mill. However, it is appropriate to use the term monomyth when discussing Hamlet's Mill. The term 'astronomomical monomyth' to describe a key theme of Hamlet's Mill was introduced by Albert Friedman in his 1972 review of the book. The term monomyth was originated/developed by the Jungian mythologist/folklorist Joseph Campbell. The concept of the monomyth was introduced by Joseph Campbell in The Hero With a Thousand Faces (1949; 1968). Campbell coined the term 'Monomyth' from James Joyce's novel Finnigan's Wake (published in its entirety in 1939). The Canadian literary critic and literary theorist Northrop Frye later developed his own version of the monomyth. Originally Frye conceived of the monomyth as "the cyclic quest of the hero" but then elaborated it differently with what is known as archetypal literary criticism. For example see his : The Great Code: The Bible & Literature (1982). The popularity of archetypal literary criticism has waned since the 1940s and 1950s and it is no longer widely practiced.
The concept of a monomyth theory is ultimately traceable to Max Müller.
Campbell's concept of monomyth refers to the theory that explains all mythic narratives as variations of a single great story. The theory is based on the observation that a common pattern (a classic sequence of actions) exists between the narrative elements of most great myths/stories, regardless of their place of origin or time of creation. There is a universal story, told with the same basic pattern, by every culture, about the journey of the hero. Campbell often referred to the ideas of the 19th-century German ethnologist Adolf Bastian and his distinction between what he called 'folk' and 'elementary' ideas, the latter referring to the prime matter of monomyth while the former to the multitude of local forms the myth takes in order to remain an up-to-date carrier of sacred meanings. The central pattern most focused on by Campbell is what is referred to as the hero's journey, a cyclical journey or quest undertaken by a mythical hero. The concept of the monomyth is an attempt to provide a key to all mythology. There is not a lot in common between Campbell's concept of a monomyth and the concept of a monomyth in Hamlet's Mill.
The distribution network for the monomyth



According to Hamlet's Mill there was point in time marking a single, unique beginning for the transmission of astronomical knowledge, and associated knowledge, around the world. This was somewhere in the ancient Near East circa 4000 BCE. There is no suggestion that the astronomical knowledge comprising the monomyth package encountered any difficulty in being understood, even by cultures without any developed astronomical knowledge. Hamlet's Mill implies that without prior instruction regarding the coding, the content of the monomyth was easily grasped, implemented, and passed on to other (nearby) cultures.
The nature/structure of the supposed ancient distribution network is never really discussed. A centralised distribution network from the ancient Near East - via intellectual elites - is posited. However, the concept of a decentralised network is not considered. A decentralised distribution network involves diffusion of knowledge to hubs which then function as further centres of diffusion. Both networks involve culture contacts. Also, how exactly an extensive network would be established and how it would function is not discussed. The authors of Hamlet's Mill imply it was used for the dissemination of intellectual ideas only. How the important matter of language differences were overcome is also not discussed. The content of the monomyth would need explaining - otherwise it would remain mythology (and poorly understood as mythology).
Excursus: Greek mythology
In Greek mythology stories of the Olympian gods/goddesses (and those preceding them) focus a lot on dysfunctional behaviours, cruelties, orgies, misdeeds, and foibles that also had counterparts in human behaviour. In their approach to stories about the Olympian gods/goddesses taken by the authors of Hamlet's Mill they interpret these stories to be a clear indicator of astronomical language. Examples of dysfunctional behaviours: 1. (pre-Olympian) The god Cronus (who ruled the pre-Olympian Titans) eating his children to ensure none of them would grow up and overthrow him. Through a trick by Cronus' wife Rhea, Zeus avoided being eaten and overthrew his father Cronus. Zeus also made Cronus vomit up the rest of Zeus's siblings and these offspring became the first of the Olympian gods/goddesses. Cronus had come to power by castrating his father Uranus (Ouranos). 2. (Olympian) The Greek myths of sexual assault by the Olympian god Zeus against mortal women and goddesses. See the Index of Hamlet's Mill for discussions of Cronus and Zeus.
The ancient texts containing the Greek myths are mostly from the period of classical Greece, circa 500 BCE. The stories behind the myths are from a much earlier period but written versions did not exist before the Classical period. The theology of the ancient Greeks was developed by the poets, not by a priestly class. The oldest Greek myths can be traced to three main sources: Homer, Hesiod and The Homeric Hymns, circa 800 BCE. (Circa 1200 BCE the inhabitants of the Greek mainland and Asia Minor shared a common belief in a group of gods/goddesses that came to be known as The Olympians.) The oldest sources of Greek mythology are the 2 epic poems written by Homer: the Odyssey and the Iliad. "The Iliad, named after Ilium, the alternative name of Troy, describes a short but vital 2-month period in the tenth year of the siege of that city by a Greek expeditionary force. The Iliad covers only 2 months of the 10-year war with Troy. [However, it is primarily about Achilles, set in the context of the Trojan war.] The Odyssey is the story of the homecoming of Odysseus from the Trojan War. Thus both poems are set in the same period, and at a great remove from the date of their composition." (The Mycenaean World by John Chadwick.(1976, Page 180).) The oldest attempt to explain the nature Greek mythology itself are the texts of Hesiod, especially Theogony. Theogony is still considered to be the source for the basis of the Greek mythology. Hesiod's Theogony describes the birth of the Greek gods/goddesses. Later, hymns, poems, tragedies, plays, arts, artists attempted to explain and reproduce the myths about the gods/goddesses, about heroes such as Hercules and Thiseas, about important kings, such as Minos, about the wars of the gods, the wars of the people. It is indicated that in Greek mythology myth and history are so artistically interwoven that at times it is not possible to separate one from the other.
Most Greek mythology can be traced back to Mycenaean Greece of the Late Helladic Bronze Age. There are definite connections between Mycenaean portrayals of gods/goddesses and their later appearance in archaic (post Dark Age) Greece. The Mycenaean civilisation circa 16501100 BCE - named after the ancient city of Mycenae - originated on mainland Greece and was the first great civilisation on the Greek mainland. The Mycenaean colonisation of Crete lasted from 1400 to 1100 BCE. The centre of Mycenaean power on Crete was Knossos. Crete is intimately associated with much of Greek mythology. It was the Mycenaeans who introduced the new Greek gods/goddesses Zeus, Hera, and Athena. Homer and Hesiod were considered great authorities on the gods/goddesses. According to Herodotus, Homer and Hesiod were thought to have a special ability to describe the gods/goddesses. In their epic poetry Homer and Hesiod consolidated for the Greeks who the main gods/goddess were. Both Homer and Hesiod carefully avoided references to local cults, legends, and traditions. They instead described to all Greek-speakers how the gods/goddesses related to one another on Mount Olympus, under the rule of Zeus. (The Olympian element of Greek religion precedes Homer and Hesiod. See: The Mycenaean World by John Chadwick.(1976, Page 85).) The gods/goddesses of Greek mythology were geographically local and that Zeus expulsed Cronus from Mount Olympus. The terrestrial Mount Olympus - whose summit is often covered by clouds - was believed to be the 'celestial' home of the major gods/goddesses. But the terrestrial connection was the gods/goddesses were on top of Mount Olympus. With the belief in gods/goddesses residing on Mount Olympus it took on an imaginary aspect in mythology. Hardly an astral setting. In ancient Greece, the personality of each god/goddess emerged from several sources. There were the local cults and their rituals and also the stories and poems and these elements combined and recombined in many different ways across the Greek world. In his writings, Plato rejected the description of the gods/goddesses presented by Homer and Hesiod. Instead, Plato took an intellectual/philosophical approach (devoid of feelings/emotions) that amounted to a rejection of traditional Greek polytheism. Plato often reworked traditional Greek religious beliefs/myths with the intention of dismantling the popular conception of the gods/goddesses. It is difficult to see how an astronomical theme unifies this kind of diversity. (See: The Gods of Olympus by Barbara Graziosi (2014).)
Note: Plato's writing's have little value as a source for myth (perhaps except in relation to the mythology of the underworld and afterlife). However, Plato's writings contain numerous mythological allusions and contain distinctive philosophical myths of Plato's own invention.
An example of a modern geological interpretation of aspects of Greek mythology: "The Greek myths of the cosmic wars between Zeus and the Titans, Cyclopes, and Typhoeus as described in Hesiod's "Theogony" were scientifically analyzed in 1992 by historian of geology Mott T. Greene. Hesiod's poem contains some very old oral stories that date to the second millennium BC. Greene demonstrated that the violent battle with the one-eyed Cyclops can be matched to anciently observed volcanic phenomena associated with the solitary Mt Vesuvius and the solfataric gas emissions in the fields of fire near Naples, Italy. In contrast, the god’s conflict with Typhoeus and the Titans represents Mt Etna's multiple cones, and the hissing and roaring features, lava flows, and deep tectonic earthquakes. Moreover, the details of Hesiod's poem suggest that it forms a chronological record of datable major eruptions of Mt Etna in about 1500 BC and in 735 BC, and the Plinian eruption in 1470 BC on the island of Thera-Santorini which destroyed the Minoan civilization." ("Geomythology" by Adrienne Mayor. In: Encyclopedia of Geology edited by Richard Selley et al. (2004, 5 Volumes).)
For a modern interpretation of Greek mythology in natural phenomena and travel journeys (mostly by sea) see: Travelling Heroes: Greeks and Their Myths in the Epic Age of Homer by Robin Fox (2008). The basic theme is Oriental cultural interaction; particularly the travels of Greeks of the 8th-century BCE east and west around the Mediterranean, and how their journeys and colonisations shaped their ideas of their gods/goddesses and heroes/heroines. Robin Fox attempts to put the Euboean Greeks (and Phoenicians) at the centre of early iron-age Greek history, the 9th and 8th centuries BCE. According to Robin Fox, traders, pirates and colonists from the Greek island of Euboea travelled to, and settled in, specific places both in the Near East and in Italy and took the stories that they heard from the diverse peoples with whom they came into contact and the



unfamiliar landscapes that they encountered, and used them to help shape their own distinctive myths. Whilst it is apparent that the author is engaging in specialist speculation - the whole thesis is constructed with terms such as "may," "might," and "surely" - the erudite use of material remains of interest. He deals with the issues that mythic themes passed between cultures and were adopted with local adornment, and the myths were being developed during the height of the Greek Bronze Age, circa 1600-1100 BCE - long after the Greek Neolithic Period circa 6800-3200 BCE. See also: Audley-Miller, Lucy and Dignas, Beate. (Editors). (2018). Wandering Myths: Transcultural Uses of Myth in the Ancient World.
Interestingly, there was no canonical set of Greek myths. Greek mythology in the sense of a homogeneous system of myths did not exist. This system was fabricated in the modern period by academics. Wherever several versions of a myth exist there may be some variations in the basic form of the story but also there may be substantial differences between the variant versions which render them completely incompatible with one another. Question: How was the supposed original monomyth organised?
Part 3: Postings by Ernest McClain to Bibal Elucidating Hamlet's Mill
Postings by Ernest McClain to Bibal (Bibal Study Group) are illuminating regarding Hamlet’s Mill. Relevant snippets include:
(1) (December 4, 2009): "... the book that follows is von Dechend's not his, and ignores quantification. He was dying at that time, and succeeded in ensuring a hearing for her."
(2) (September 21[20?], 2009): "... I never met this brief and brilliant essay of de Santillana from his paperback of 1983 because in 1972-3 I had to buy the hardcover first edition of 1969 to learn why my editors at MAIN CURRENTS IN MODERN THOUGHT were so excited about HAMLET'S MILL, in which he loaned his name to Hertha von Dechend to get her book into print. She shared none of his Pythagorean interest in quantification, but he recognized generously the significance of her recognition of pattern. (I was never aware of the paperback with his new essay.) I struggled to get my work in decent shape to present to him before he died in 1974, but failed to my own very great loss, because I thought him the only man then alive who could understand me properly (as I wanted to be). [That turned out not to be true, because Patrick Heelan, S.J., who edited my book with ease for publication in 1976] produced a brilliant summary of his own in "Music as basic metaphor and deep structure in Plato and in ancient cultures." (J. Social and Biological Structures, 1979-2, pp. 279-291.)] Amlodi's Mill at the bottom of the sea is Iceland's variation on the Holy Mountain which is the subject of my book. ..."
(3) (December 20, 2007): "... Hamlet's MIll (sic) was published in '69 and I believe von Dechend's contributions were developed earlier before should (sic [she] could have met Palsson's work. [Icelandic scholar Einar Pálsson (1925-1996), whose 11-volume opus entitled Rætur íslenzkrar menningar (Roots of Icelandic Culture) published between 1969 and 1995 is based on the author's research over 5 decades into the imagery of Iceland's ancient poetic and saga literature. Most of his numerous speculations - 'landscape-cosmogram theory' apply to the medieval period continue to be untested.] Her interests and de Santillana's were very different. ..." (4) (July 28, 2007): "... My only problem with von Dechend was her total disinterest in the quantitative. To her, music was "off the wall." There was nothing to talk about. ..."
(4) (January 3, 2007): "... I do NOT believe that "acceptance of the Precession" as verified for the ancients is by any means "a done deal." Your statement is mainly an excuse to stop thinking about some difficult problems. As I see it, your intuition may prove correct, but the argument ignores a substantial amount of counter evidence. People explain the "unknown" in highly imaginative ways. I often inveigh against the conservatism of scholars, but it is instructive to follow their arguments closely when they make them. This argument merely jumps to a conclusion that allows mind to rest. That's how we help to choose our own fates. It's everybody's privilege. Precession is a very intricate idea. "Appearances" can be accepted without being explained. I see NO evidence for a doctrine of professional secrecy except from practitioners of a craft trying to protect their own income. The old scribes were very proud to be serving the crown. ..."
(5) (January 1, 2007): "This woman [von Dechend] apparently never suspected how very late her "precessional" documentation is, and was incapable of handling quantification of any kind whatever. Santillana's introduction to her book is one of the finest pieces of "Pythagorean" exposition. Her book that follows is totally fraudulent (but innocent) scholarship that has intoxicated thousands (including some of my own friends) and greatly encouraged nonsensical theories. Her failure to understand her OWN material means that the stone circles and monuments that have surfaced in many places on the globe can NOT be explained by HER evidence, and so the question as to whether ANYBODY actually recognized "precession" before Hipparchus remains wide open, and needs to be studied anew with an open mind. I no longer have time to pursue that line of thought. I'm simply warning a few of you to trust nothing you have borrowed from her as "evidence." And while you are at it, you'd better ignore me also. She has misled many people since 1969, including some who are otherwise very intelligent. I rejected her work at first glance about 1973-74, but without recognizing where the Kalevala material came from. I missed the brilliance of Homeric allegory until reading his work again with Augusta as she was failing after 2001. She loved the old classics--and drew me more deeply into them as we read to each other. I'm still betting on Hipparchus--which of course leaves quite a lot to be explained by somebody else. The old monuments, after all, do "exist" in substantial numbers."
(6) (December 26, 2006): "... I am NO fan of von Dechend whatever. However the question here is when does evidence of precession surface in the literature. So far it cannot be proved by circular artifacts, however subtle. For one thing, the ancients are tracking the moon for lunar Sabbaths in the middle of the month, and to them lunar motion was highly elusive, measurement could only be approximate, and perfect regularity in moon behavior was NEVER assumed until the synodic lunar year eventually was recognized (when is unclear). Thus in the third millennium when this literary description surfaces there was apparently no theory that would have been surprised by "precession." Temples might have been reconstructed as you describe quite without such a theory. Once Greek reasoning postulates "perfect circles forever," however, there is now an "idealist" assumption that CAN be questioned, and it was immediately in the centuries following Plato as his model was touched up repeatedly before Ptolemy arrives to make explicit Pythagorean MUSICAL assumptions. At which point he applies precession casually to the double octave of 9/8 wholetones (and unspecified semitones). His monochord of 120x3600=432,000 hypothetical units thus "cuts off" the accuracy of the 13th pitch class in Spiral 5ths, and leaves us (me) wondering why he didn't integrate Hipparchus value for the precession instead of accepting Plato's 60^4=12,960,000 cosmology. (If you think I've got this wrong please correct me.) There is no evidence whatever in the Osiris mythology as I read it for precession: the twin mountains of sunrise and sunset are taken for granted, and so is the underground return nightly through the Underworld from West to East (viz. there is NO "celestial rotation"--only the "rotation of the model itself."... I also fault von Dechend for her attacks on reputable scholarship--which has become rampant since (as it had been before). ..."
(7) (September 11, 2006): "... Hamlet's Mill opens with de Santillana's exquisite presentation of Pythagorean structuralism, one of the finest ever composed, but he is generously lending his name to ensure a hearing for von Dechend's work which suppresses all mathematical structuralism. [Note: In the preface to the book, de Santillana claims he is barely deserving of senior authorship of the book. This also has to do with the fact that the material comprising the book is basically von Dechend's.] And she has inspired many people, two of them notably (in my experience). Her book became famous while I was working hard on Plato, and I refused to read it until far along, with a draft of Pythagorean Plato behind and some initial work on The Myth of Invariance. And at that point she had nothing to teach me, I thought. When I presented my work to her seminar at M.I.T. (and drafts of my papers) she had ZERO response to anything at all. Ten years later I sat for two long days of seminar discussions with her



and 4 or 5 others, and her inability to make the slightest sense of anything I said or thought was perfect. ..." [According to Pythagorean doctrines music is the essence of all things. This was realised by de Santillana but not followed as a way to explain so-called precessional numbers.]
(8) (December 3, 2005): "... My "Marduk Universe" is the inspiration for von Dechend's "World Tree" with its "hour-glass drum" shape, but her own disinterest in "quantification" blinds her enthusiasts to the fact that de Santillana's brilliant opening essay on Pythagoreanism is merely a "come-on" for her quite "un-Pythagorean" fantasy that follows. That opening essay remains a great introduction to my own work, but Santillana never knew the work of Kilmer, Crocker and Brown that documents musicology to "Old Babylon" (2000-1600 BC)--a thousand years before Pythagoras (who I regard as pure fiction, that is, a convenient Greek gloss on what it inherited sans detail that is still only now coming to light). And von Dechend never learned to handle quantitative material. ... You and others who are curious about the failure of von Dechend and myself to reach any understanding at all (when we finally met a second time in the 90's--ten years after I presented my findings to her seminar at M.I.T) will have to judge us for yourselves. I found it impossible to have ANY coherent conversation with her. My own digging still continues and is far from finished; she had no concept of the mastery of "quantification" that PRECEEDED the events that attract her attention. ..."

Also, Leroy Ellenberger (14-July-1994, http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/cle/cle-talbott.txt) asserted: "While McClain works in obscurity, he has always had academic allies and recently H.

The above identifies the claim that von Dechend recognised the insights of McClain to be in error.
Ernest (Ernst) McClain (1918-2014) propounded the thesis that archaic mythology was to be interpreted as musical cosmology. See his book, The Myth of Invariance (1976). Ernest Glenn McClain was professor emeritus of music at Brooklyn College. The ethnomusicologist Marius Schneider (1903-1987) was an influence on McClain. See the essay by Schneider in Cosmic Music (1989), and the (English-language) book review by Douglas Leedy in Notes, Second Series, Volume 48, Number 1, September, 1991, Pages 58-60. The importance of music in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia is perhaps still unappreciated today. When the Assyrians sacked a city and massacred its inhabitants, amongst the booty they took back to Assur included precious metals, jewels, and musicians. In his book, Kingship and the Gods (1948), Henri Frankfort points out that a principle in ancient Egyptian art is that the pharaoh dominates the scene. However, in the tomb painting of Ramses III (shown on the cover of Scientific American (September 1994)) the 21-string harp is depicted larger than the pharaoh. The text contains a 2nd picture in which an 11-string harp is depicted bigger than the pharaoh.
Part 4: The Basic Problem: A Critical Overview
The Primary Sources
Simply checking the primary sources makes the book dubious and unconvincing. (1) Discredited 19th-century philology underpins the book's argument. (In the 19th-century Andrew Lang criticised the notion that myths could be easily compared through merely textual methods and showed that the philological approach to mythology by Müller and Schmidt was unreliable, being merely a form of armchair anthropology. However, Max Müller was not wholly mistaken on solar and elemental aspects of Sanskrit myth.) (2) Discarded anthropological/ethnological ideas of the Austrian-German diffusionist school are influential within the book. (3) Authors influenced by the discredited ideas of the Panbabylonian/Star Myth School are used. (4) The discussion of Near Eastern (Mesopotamian) astronomy relies on outdated publications. (5) Modern approached to mythology are ignored/rejected in favour of discredited 19th-century interpretations.
Neolithic Mesopotamia not a homogeneous unit
The inhabitants of early Mesopotamia were not a homogeneous cultural unit. During the Neolithic period Mesopotamian cultures were not united and harmonious. The geographical area comprising Mesopotamia was divided into a number of small kingdoms and independent city-states. Warfare was a rather constant activity. Also, knowledge of Assyro-Babylonian religion still remains on many points incomplete and provisional.
No knowledge of Neolithic mythology
Hamlet's Mill is based on beliefs about Neolithic mythology. Almost nothing is known about Neolithic mythological beliefs. We do not have any mythology that dates back to the Neolithic period. Much of what is stated about mythology in Neolithic societies is simply conjecture. In the absence of written evidence we have no examples of Neolithic mythology. There are no extant textual sources from the Neolithic period, the most recent available textual sources date from the Bronze Age. All statements about any belief systems that may have been possessed by Neolithic societies are glimpsed from archaeology. Greek traditions indicate prehistorical material but working through such is fraught with difficulty. Were there myths in the Neolithic period? We simply do not know. Attempts to reconstruct Neolithic myths from much later material (such as done by John Grigsby) - that could have been finally written down in the Medieval period - is an exercise in speculation. There is no reason to believe that any existing Neolithic mythology was passed down - if indeed it was - without being altered.
See for example: The Lessons of Nature in Mythology by Rachel McCoppin (2015).
The archaeologist Michael O’Kelley, has a short discussion (brief chapter) in his book, Newgrange (1982), regarding the possibility of the survival of Neolithic myths (in oral tradition) into medieval times. See also: The Singer of Tales in Performance by John Foley (1981, 1995).
The Neolithic period saw an increase in the permanency of settlements and the growth of agriculture. There is archaeological evidence for greater mobility and transfers of cultural ideas and knowledge on a macro-scale (supra-regional scale and long-term). This is the best that can be done prior to writing. The concept that early people choose to share certain practices in order to serve particular social purposes is not raised by the authors of Hamlet's Mill.
Von Dechend believed she was establishing evidence that advanced astronomical information had been gathered before the origin of writing. History/writing begins in the ancient Near East. While earlier peoples left signs at Stonehenge and on the walls of caves in France it is in the Near East that we first find messages, evidence of the transmission of knowledge from one generation to another, and the organization of nomadic tribes into societies with distinctive class structures, religions, and governments.
Hamlet's Mill and archaeoastronomy



It has been mistakenly claimed several times that Hamlet's Mill is archaeoastronomy. The claim the Hamlet's Mill is linked to archaeoastronomy is interesting. According to Wikipedia (26/1/2013): "Von Dechend is best known for her collaborative work on Hamlet’s Mill: an Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time, co-authored with Giorgio de Santillana, an Italian-American philosopher and historian of science on the faculty at MIT. Hamlet's Mill is a study of history, mythology, and specifically archaeoastronomy." In one of his articles Roopa H. Naragan has stated that investigating knowledge of astronomy in mythology is part of the discipline of archaeoastronomy.
Obviously there is a clear failure to understand that archaeoastronomy combines the workings of archaeology with astronomy to gather more information about a site or culture. Hamlet's Mill is primarily an exercise in out-dated 19th-century philology. The beginning of archaeoastronomy (and the beginning of the movement to interconnect archaeology and astronomy) is usually considered to be the publication of Dawn of Astronomy by Joseph Lockyer (1894) by However, Lockyer's method of investigation did not include the use of archaeology. Archaeology was entirely ignored. Lockyer attempted to use only astronomical data to date structures. A more legitimate candidate is the eminent French amateur prehistorian Marcel Baudouin (1860-1941) who argued for the existence of a Paleolithic stellar-solar cult. Formally trained in medicine, he later became an outstanding amateur pre-historian and archaeologist. Baudouin has never became as widely known as Lockyer. Worth noting is L'Abbé Jean Lebeuf (1687-1760), a renowned French historian, folklorist, musicologist, and archaeologist, is a forgotten pioneer of archaeoastronomy and ethnoastronomy.
Lockyer's work and its lack of scientific data drew a great deal of criticism. It was the later - but also unreliable - work of Gerald Hawkins that helped to establish archaeoastronomy as a legitimate and reputable field of study. In 1968, Stonehenge Decoded by Gerald Hawkins was published.
Archaeoastronomy has largely dealt with celestial alignments. In doing so it has also attracted more than just scholars. Alternative historians have become enamoured with the subject and published speculative and sensational theories where rigorous proof is not emphasised. Once again. slowly, the field of archaeoastronomy is regaining its reputability as more scholars get involved, and it becomes easier to distinguish credible work from other unfounded sources.
The treatment of mythology
In his 1970 book review of Hamlet's Mill, Jaan Purvel wrote "... it does attempt to explain at one stroke all of man's myth and must thus be held accountable as a treatise on mythology."
The origins and wanderings of themes in myths, sagas, and fairy tales is a notorious problem (and likely to remain so).
The authors of Hamlet's Mill argue for the astronomical interpretation of literally all myth. Supporters hold that no further work on the interpretation and meaning of world-wide myths is required. Hamlet's Mill has been misdescribed as a work in cultural anthropology. Much of its content is too vague for this. Despite its vagueness Hamlet's Mill is essentially a book on comparative mythology. Hertha von Dechend has been described as a specialist in comparative mythology. Hertha von Dechend has also been described as a pioneering archaeoastronomer, but this description is not justified. The Frobenius-Institut lists her as an ethnologist and archaeoastronomer. Such descriptions are rather incredible, and distortive. Surprisingly, Patrick Heelen (Space-Perception and the Philosophy of Science (1980, Page 99)) mistakes von Dechend as a classicist. It is evident that the parallelomania of Panbabylonism underpins Hamlet's Mill. Von Dechend spent her academic life reinterpreting ancient myths as a scientific code for astronomical events. She believed there was a world-wide cultural homogeneity in myths. Within Hamlet’s Mill there is an assumption that mythology was once complete and rational. In their book Hamlet's Mill Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend claim there is a profound coherence behind the many thousands of seemingly chaotic myths, legends, and stories. Ancient myths can be interpreted as a code language for the precessional cycle. However, the comparative method is inevitably full of uncertainties, and still not well developed. The German Protestant theologian Hans Schaer, following the ideas of Carl Jung, has set out that people, ancient and modern, have common patterns of thinking. This works against diffusionism as a necessary answer for cultural similarities.
How and exactly why the supposed Near East monomyth was carried to new places and why its pre-literate form remained largely stable are issues ignored in Hamlet's Mill. If other cultures were aware of precession then why would the particular Near East precessional monomyth matter? If other cultures were not aware of precession then, again, why would the particular Near East precessional monomyth be relevant? Also, were certain feature change in some cultural locations and also were there places and cultures the supposed monomyth did not get carried to (or were rejected by)?
It has been stated that Hamlet's Mill is thematically similar to The Masks of God (4 volumes, 1957-1968) by Joseph Campbell. The Masks of God is also concerned with demonstrating the similarities between myths. The wide range of influences in addition to Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, included the Dutch-born British biologist and ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen (1907-1988) and the Austrian zoologist, ethologist, and ornithologist Konrad Lorenz (1903-1989), both credited as the founders of modern ethology. (Joseph Campbell often referred to physiological bases of mythological materials.) Whilst working on his first book Joseph Campbell had attended the lectures of Heinrich Zimmer (1890–1943), a German Indologist at Columbia University. Shortly after Zimmer died, Campbell devoted the next 12 years editing (almost coauthoring) Zimmer's lecture notes into 4 books: Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization (1946), The King and the Corpse (1948), Philosophies of India (1951), and The Art of Indian Asia (1955). Joseph Campbell was born in 1904, in New York City. After seeing Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, at Madison Square Garden, as a child he developed an interest in Native American mythology and history. From 1921 to 1922 he attended Dartmouth College. He then transferred to Columbia University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1925 and a master's degree in medieval literature in 1927. During the next 2 years, he studied French and German medieval literature in Paris and Munich, as part of working towards a doctorate degree. He abandoned his plans to complete a PhD when informed that mythology was an unsuitable topic for his thesis. Campbell returned to the United States in the early 1930s and was unable to find immediate employment. He spent several years reading at a cabin in Woodstock, New York. In 1934, Joseph Campbell obtained a teaching position at Sarah Lawrence College in New York. He remained there until his retirement in 1972, teaching comparative mythology and literature. He died in 1987. "In The Hero with a Thousand Faces he described the monomyth (or the hero's journey), a narrative cycle that can be found embedded in all legends in whole or in part, and linked this to psychological roots. In his epic fourvolume work The Masks of God, he explored the specific cultural variations of these commonalities from an anthropological perspective. The guiding idea behind these books followed Adolf Bastian's concepts of "elementary ideas" (elementargedanken) and "folk ideas" (volkergedanken), which also influenced Carl Jung's concept of "archetypes of the collective unconsciousness". The idea was that there are common elements ("elementary ideas") to all our mythologies which are wrapped up in local, cultural baggage ("folk ideas"). (Chris Batema: http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2009/06/what-did-joseph-campbell-believe.html)"
The Hero With a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell is built on the work of the 19th-century German Polymath Adolph Bastian (1826-1905) who was a key contributor to the establishment of the modern disciplines of ethnology and anthropolgy. Bastian's theory of the Elementargedanke, led to Carl Jung's development of the theory of archetypes, and in turn this influenced the work of the Jungian comparative mythologist Joseph



Campbell. Adolf Bastian first proposed the idea that world-wide myths appear to embody the same "elementary ideas" (= monomyth)." The Swiss occultist and mystic Carl Jung (1875-1961) adopted this theory and named these elementary ideas "archetypes." Jung held that these "archetypes" were the building blocks not only of the unconscious mind, but also what he termed the "collective unconscious." Jung believed that every person in the world is born with identical basic subconscious modes of constructing stories (story structure is part of a "hard-wired" mental "operating system"). Jung's developed his theory of archetypes with the purpose of using it as a tool to find meaning in the dreams and visions of mentally ill persons. Joseph Campbell used Jung's theory of archetypes to identify what he believed were common underlying structures underpinning all religions and myths across time and space. Interestingly, the ultimate source for the contents of Campbell's chapter "Circumpolar Cults of the Master Bear" (Pages 147-151) in his The Way of Animal Powers: Historical Atlas of World Mythology. Volume 1 (1983) may have been Geographische Kulturkunde by Leo Frobenius (1904).
Also, Hamlet's Mill interprets sexual and other oddities by the gods/goddesses (such as sexual mutilation and cannibalism) as astronomical. As example: "... the emasculation of Ouranos stands for establishing the obliquity of the ecliptic: the beginning of measurable time. (Page 135)" But see the totally different discussion and interpretation of odd sexual and other behaviour by god/goddesses by Carolina López-Ruiz in her book When the Gods Were Born (2010, Chapter 4: Orphic and Phoenician Theogonies). She discusses such behaviour within the framework of a cosmic scheme of power.
In their introduction to Hamlet’s Mill the authors state they are well aware of modern interpretations of myth and folklore but they find them shallow and lacking insight: "...the experts now are benighted by the current folk fantasy, which is the belief that they are beyond all this - critics without nonsense and extremely wise." The authors instead prefer to rely on the work of "meticulous scholars such as Ideler, Lepsius, Chwolson, Boll and, to go farther back, of Athanasius Kircher and Petavius." Throughout the book the authors give reasons for preferring the work of older scholars (and the early mythologists themselves) as the proper way to interpret myth. The basic procedure of de Santillana and von Dechend copies from (mostly) from the amateur German philologist Edward Stucken (Astralmythen, 5 Parts, 1896-1907) and also the German assyriologist Peter Jensen (Das Gilgamesch-Epos in der Weltliteratur, 2 Volumes, 1906-1928). (Peter Jensen propounded that the Gilgamesh epic was the source of all mythological patterns in world-wide literature.) They compare motifs. Stucken's method was to identify motifs within Mesopotamian stories and then identify correspondences. Stucken based his theory on certain similar features of narratives/myths. Whilst he collected a huge number of parallels from all over the world they largely remain unconvincing. (Stucken was criticised for knowing no restraint.) As example, Stucken was unconcerned when matching motifs whether certain features of a historical tale were analogous to certain features of a mythical story. De Santillana and von Dechend claim analogical features. They also looked for similarities in iconography.
In his Blog article, "Hamlet's Mill: Precession or Solar Symbol." (4/12/2012), Jason Colavito states: "Almost all modern alternative claims derive from the work of Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend in Hamlet's Mill (1969), which argued that "measures and counting," specifically as related to astrology, were "the frame on which the rich texture of real myth was to grow." That phrase—real myth—gave the authors license to selectively choose which myths were "real" based on how closely they conformed to an imagined prehistoric knowledge of precession."
Numerous examples discussed in Hamlet's Mill actually date to the Medieval period, not earlier e.g., (1) the figures Hamlet, Kullervo, and Amlodhi, (2) Firdausi's epic Persian poem Shahmana [the Shāh Nāma by Firdausi is a pseudo-history of the early kings of Persia], (3) the depiction of 'The Churning of the Milky Way' at Angkor Wat, and (4) the architectural depiction of the '7 planetary spheres' at Borobudur temple. Also, the Pythagoreans and Platonic ideas and myths have a pivotal role in their interpretations.
No attempt is made to create a chronology and no attempt is made to identify the specific cultures that have common motifs. Broadly, in the ancient world, from Hesiod (Greek poet, circa 8th-century BCE) to St Paul (Roman citizen, 1st-century CE, a convert from Judaism to Christianity), the idea of things 'running down' ('entropy') is a dominant theme in ancient mythology.
Excursus: The Amleth (Amlodhi) Story
"The late versions of the Amleth story which Gollancz published in 1898 do not offer much help in deciding what the original form of the tale could have been, or how far it was a popular Danish legend." Saxo Grammaticus: History of the Danes by Peter Fisher and Hilda Davidson (2 Volumes, 1979-1980, Volume 1, Page 68.) It is worth noting the stories which Saxo Grammaticus tells are often chaotic and difficult to follow. Also, the bulk of his material comprised West Norse tradition.
Saxo Grammaticus (circa 1150–circa 1220 CE) (also known as Saxo cognomine Longus), was a Medieval Danish historian, theologian and author, between Norse and Latin culture. His is thought to have been a secular cleric within the archbishopric in Lund. A clerk or secretary to Absalon, Archbishop of Lund, foremost advisor to Valdemar I of Denmark. Saxo Grammaticus is the author of the first full history of Denmark. At that period Denmark was the dominant power in the North, and Saxo celebrated it in a work of 16 books divided into groups of 4, the first 3 of which end with a major event: the first with the birth of Christ; the second with the coming of Christianity; the third with the establishment of the archiepiscopal see in Lund; the last group treats the period 1104-1187. It is thought likely that Saxo Grammaticus studied abroad. The greatest influence on his style was Valerius Maximus.
See the recent modern edition: Saxo Grammaticus. Gesta Danorum: The History of the Danes edited by Karsten Friis-Jensen (translated from Danish into English by Peter Fisher), (2 Volumes, 2015). (The best translation of Gesta Danorum; aided by commentary/discussion of time of composition, title of the work, structure, themes, language and models, poetry and poets, sources, and influences.)
Mythology as astronomical language
Hamlet's Mill is an amazing exhibition of academic narrow-mindedness, unrestrained speculation, and lack of expert knowledge, on the part of its authors. Within the framework of the book recent scholarship is ignored or dismissed. Modern anthropological research is mostly ignored (and indeed distrusted). The authors maintain that they are correct and everybody else (with their non-astronomical interpretation of mythology) is wrong. For the authors of Hamlet's Mill myth is an astronomical code language. Ancient myths (all) have no historical or factual basis other than a cosmological one encoding astronomical phenomena, especially the precession of the equinoxes. An ancient ur-myth encrypting sophisticated astronomical knowledge - to enable ease of transmission and maintain secrecy within world-wide groups of recognised intellectual elites - was hyperdiffused by migration from the Near East. Trust is given to older authorities - such a Rydberg and his fantasies concerning a 'world-mill' even when genuine modern scholarship has shown them to be out of date and misleading. The 'monomyth theory' - traceable all the way back to Max Müller - is revived, despite its absurdity. Max Müller reduced all mythology to sun-worship. (Max Müller was not wholly mistaken on solar and elemental aspects of Sanskrit myth.) The authors of Hamlet's Mill associate all myth with astronomy. In Hamlet's Mill myth is promoted as the early language of science - not a form of fiction opposed to science. Their claim that all myths are strictly astronomical and all trace back to a single unidentified Neolithic civilization, located somewhere in the Near East, is unsustainable.



The use of the tem 'elites' is used in modern historical discussions and has caused much recent discussion regarding what can reasonably be meant. 'Elites' are best defined as people who held and exercised power. They are small group of people that wield much of the power to to influence people and make decisions. An example would be rulers (i.e., kings, pharaohs, chiefs). Elites, by pursuing their own (economic) interest (and change and innovation), bring cultural ideas, technical innovation, and knowledge, at least as a by-product. This modern explanation for the use of the term is different to how it is used in Hamlet's Mill.
Hamlet's Mill is far from being a demonstration of how the language of ancient stories can be simultaneously poetic and scientifically/technically precise/accurate. It is certainly a demonstration of how obscurantism can win wide and uncritical admiration. One supporter of Hamlet's Mill writes that ancient myths encode a vast and complex body of accurate astronomical information (scientific data of the highest level and greatest precision)! Another supporter of Hamlet's Mill writes: "An exhaustive look at the astronomical themes and terminology in myths worldwide."
According to de Santillana and von Dechend, the great strength of myths as vehicles for specific technical information is that they are capable of transmitting that information independently of the knowledge of the story tellers. They also state that technical terminology has its own laws and is not subject to the jurisdiction of linguists. However, issues connected with these assertions are not investigated.
If the astronomical information contained in the code (myth) is not recorded elsewhere then how is the benchmark for accuracy of content established? If the same system of astronomical ideas, expressed in the same symbolic language, existed across the pre-literate geographic/cultural blocks comprising Near East, Mediterranean, Northern Europe, Orient, Oceania, and Mesoamerica – as claimed by the author’s of Hamlet's Mill then what were the processes enabling this astonishing diffusion of coded astronomical ideas across cultures, oceans, and continents? Why is there a lack of other 'traceable' types of information? If there is a coded precessional monomyth widely distributed over the globe then: (1) how did this occur? (2) why did this occur? How was this new type of myth unfailingly introduced across the globe with consistency retained?
Between the end of the Neolithic period and the time of the pre-Socratic Greek philosophers there was evidently a loss of understanding (worldwide) of the supposed astronomical content of myth.
It has been incorrectly suggested by one person that von Dechend brings Jungianism into the book.
Hamlet's Mill is an extension of earlier attempts to establish an astronomical interpretation of mythology. Their treatment of major myths as astronomical systems having a word-wide basis mimics the German star-myth school of the late 19th-century and early 20th-century. Advanced astronomical information had been gathered before the invention of writing and transmitted through myth (an archaic technical language). Specifically, precession was the fundamental focus of archaic astronomy. Astronomical interpretations of mythology (often incorporating precession as the "key") have been extensively promoted in numerous books published between circa 1880 and 1930. Historically, proponents of a scheme of astronomical mythology (nearly always based on an equally divided 12-constellation zodiac) have ceaselessly demonstrated that it is possible to incorporate a diverse and differing range of astronomical data into their interpretations. Almost all the authors interpret the same mythology or epics with different astronomical data i.e., identify different astronomical phenomenon. Simply, an "astro-mythic" scheme can bear several interpretations. (It is also interesting to see the apparently Jungian "astro-mythic" slant given to Hebrew mythology by Tom Chetwynd in his The Age of Myth (1991).) Such multitude of divergence indicates that the methodology is flawed or that the interpretations are forced. In a nutshell: The problem is no "astronomical key" has been identified - as is evidenced by the diverse astronomical methods of interpretation. This facilitates the criticism that often the method(s) of "astro-mythic" interpretation is perhaps not a method after all. A reasonable analogy would perhaps be the elaborate "Bacon is Shakespeare" ciphers that have been "discovered". What stands out is the fact that the coding systems and underlying identification messages are never the same. The 2 volumes by Ignatius Donnelly titled The Great Cryptogram (1888) are a prime example. John Nicolson's book No Ciphers in Shakespeare (1888) showed that the cipher scheme "discovered" by Ignatius Donnelly can be used to produce any required result. Likewise, elements within a single scheme of astronomical mythology can produce several variant interpretations. Note: Also see the critiques of Donnelly's cryptogram: "Shakespeare and Bacon." by Benvolio (a fictional character in Shakespeare's drama Romeo and Juliet) (Knowledge, November, 1887, Pages 16-19). "Shakespeare and Donnelly." by Anon (Knowledge, June, 1888, Pages 182-183). "Bacon's Own Cipher." by Anon (Knowledge, July, 1888, Pages 204-205). "An Undecipherable Cipher." by Richard Proctor (Knowledge, July, 1888, Pages 205-206). "The Donnelly Cipher Deciphered." by Anon (Knowledge, August, 1888, Pages 223-225). "Mr Donnell's Ciphering." by Anon (Knowledge, September, 1888, Pages 246-247).
The problem is illustrated by two "recent" publications using the same tale in the context of Hamlet's Mill (1969). They are Heavens Unearthed in Nursery Rhymes and Fairy Tales by Matt Kane (1999) and Imaginary Landscapes: Making Worlds of Myth and Science by William Thompson (1989). Both authors refer to Hamlet's Mill: An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time. In "Chapter 5: Rumpelstiltskin" of Kane's book he interprets the tale as a lunar myth. In "Chapter 1: Rapunzel: Cosmology Lost" of Thompson's book he interprets the tale as involving the sun and moon and the planetary motion of Mercury, Venus and Mars. There is hardly a sense of reliability in interpretation here. (William Thompson was a colleague of Hertha von Dechend when she was at MIT. Both were in the Department of Humanities. He was at MIT from 1965 to 1968; Associate Professor of Humanities (i.e., Associate Professor of Literature) from 1966. At his current website (2010) he states that Hertha von Dechend discussed her ideas on ancient mythology and astronomy with him at their lunches in the student cafeteria. However, in a slide set (Journeys of the Goddess) William Thompson states: "My reading of myth owes everything to my faculty lunchtime discussions with Giorgio di (sic) Santillana and Hertha von Dechend at MIT in the 1960s." The version by John Ebert in his book Twilight of the Clockwork God 1999) is distortive. It is set out by William Thompson that von Dechend's ideas helped him to develop one level of his multi-layered reading of the Rapunzel story.) Interestingly, William Thompson has adopted the technique of using zodiacal timing (= 'zodiacal age') to frame historical research. A successful theory is such because it can best fit all the known facts. Also, within each of the sciences a single controlling theory tends to dominate. Two opposing theories which can use similar starting points but arrive at different explanative outcomes to fit the facts need to be given further investigation before one is accepted (with or without modification) or neither is accepted. It is also really up to the proponents of an idea to reasonably establish their case - including answering all reasonable criticisms raised.
Regarding: Kane, Matt. (1999). Heavens Unearthed in Nursery Rhymes and Fairy Tales. Involved with speculative arguments that nursery rhymes and fairy tales were closely connected to solar and lunar activity. See the (English-language) book review by Gail de Vos (Storyteller, University of Alberta, School of Library and Information Studies) in The Journal of American Folklore Volume 114, Number 451, Winter, 2001, Pages 112114.
Note: Thompson (The Time Falling bodies Take to Light, Pages 107-110) claims that a 'primitive' zodiac is depicted within the Lascaux cave paintings.
Presently (circa 2015) there seems to be an (ongoing) enthusiasm for 'finding' astronomical content in mythology. To boldly claim, as Matt Kane does, that Snow White, Rumpelstiltskin, and other fairy tale persons are actually mnemonic tales of celestial cycles dating back to the Ice Age, is simply fantasy. The earliest known mention of Rumplestiltskin occurs in Johann Fischart's Geschichtklitterung, or Gargantua of 1577 (a loose adaptation of Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel) which refers to an "amusement" for children named "Rumpele stilt or the Poppart".



The content of the speculations of the above-mentioned authors, however, apart from the premises which enable them, are essentially in conflict. Relative harmony would be a better indicator of the reliability of the "astro-mythic" method. What perhaps would also be more credible is an astronomical interpretation that did not incorporate a scheme of ancient zodiacal constellations to prop the "precession in mythology" approach. The nature of the claims for precessional mythology (invariably based on a conjectured ancient 12-constellation zodiac of 12 equal divisions) require that any difficult facts arising from such need to be critically discussed and myopic approaches avoided. We need to separate conviction from science and to ensure we satisfactorily do such we should not disable our skepticism.
19th-century mythographical scholarship
Mythographical scholarship in Britain in the 19th-century attempted to identify the "key to all mythologies." There is an attempt to explain with one theory (i.e., refer to one origin) a mass of phenomena wholly unconnected and arising for numerous reasons. Hamlet's Mill shares the ideas at the core of 19th-century mythographical scholarship: (1) Myths do not yield their true meaning to those who read them literally. Myths, when properly interpreted show patterns of correspondence between each other. Decodings of this sort were at the core of early modern and 19th-century mythographical anlysis. (2) Diffusionism provided the dominant theory. It was assumed that myths did not spring up independently in several places, but that on the whole mythologies were copied from one culture to another. Also, many mythographers interpreted pagan myths as solar or zodiacal allegories. Another common interpretation was the identification of pagan mythologies as the worship of the regenerative powers of nature (phallic worship).
Two radical exponents of a French system of mythography were Charles Dupuis and Constantin Volney. In France Charles Dupuis and similarly Constantin Volney both claimed an astronomical basis/key for interpreting all mythologies. For Dupuis it was his belief/perception that the celestial motions, including the rising and settings of stars, and the passage of the sun across different constellations provided the solution to the apparent absurd stories/happenings in ancient mythology. Dupuis' key to the interpretation of all mythologies was they were allegories of the sun, the constellations of the northern hemisphere, and the annual natural cycle of vegetative birth, death, and renewal. For Volney it was his belief/perception that zodiacal allegories (which had degenerated over time into unrefined superstitions) provided the solution to mythological stories. According to Volney, over time, the sages in ancient societies, who once possessed the cipher for decoding allegories, lost the key which enabled them to access to the meanings behind popular myths.

Coded astronomy or astronomy coded for secrecy?
In reply to the proposal posted on Hastro-L that the approach of the authors of Hamlet's Mill is not new; that it is the "Secret Doctrine" approach ("myth contains deliberately coded information"), the German academic Franz Krojer contributed the interesting reply (Hastro-L, January 27, 2003): "I had and have also much difficulties with this book. I contacted therefore H. v. Dechend two years ago, before her death, and some of that correspondence will be in my book about (against) the medieval "fictious" (sic) time Illig's (but only in German). I can't follow the "Secret Doctrine" connected with v. Dechend. As far as I understand v. Dechend, the myths do not contain "deliberated (sic) encoded information", but they were simply the "open" scientific language (at least for the priests) to express scientific insights at that time. (I don't know, if this differentiation is too scholastic, but I see here two standpoints.) ...." Mythology, whether or not the "open" lingua franca of ancient priests and scholars in the Near East, presents problems. Simply, how did this particular cultural/regional lingua franca become known and used world-wide?
In the Index of the original edition of Hamlet's Mill the words "code" and "lingua franca" do not appear.
It seems indicated by the authors of Hamlet's Mill that mythology was the lingua franca of priests/scholars and its use as a technical scientific language only understood by persons instructed in this particular usage. Otherwise the language had the appearance of simply being stories.
"Today's children, that impassive posterity to whom all reverence is due, know where to look for myths: in animal life, in the Jungle Books, in the stories of Lassie and Flipper, where innocence is unassailable, in Western adventures suitably arranged by grownups for the protection of law and order. Much of the rest sedulously built up by mass media is modern prejudice and delusion, like the glamor of royalty, or the perfection of superdetergents and cosmetics: super-stitio, leftovers. So one might feel tempted to say actually, however, no particle of myth today is left over, and we have to do only with a deliberate lie about the human condition. Tolkien's efforts at reviving the genre, whatever the talent employed, carry as much conviction as the traditional three-dollar bill. The assumed curious child would have been pleased only if he had been told the "story" of the engine just as Kipling tells it, which is hardly the style of a mechanical engineer. But suppose now the child had been confronted with the "story" of a planet as it emerges from the textbooks of celestial mechanics, and had been asked to calculate its orbits and perturbations. This would be a task for a joyless grownup, and a professional one at that. Who else could face the pages bristling with partial differential equations, with long series of approximations, with integrals contrived from pointless quadratures? Truly a world of reserved knowledge. But if, on the other hand, a person living several thousand years ago had been confronted with cunningly built tales of Saturn's reign, and of his exorbitant building and modeling activities-after he had separated Heaven and Earth by means of that fateful sickle, that is, after he had established the obliquity of the ecliptic. If he had heard of Jupiter's ways of command and his innumerable escapades, populating the earth with gentle nymphs forever crossed in their quest for happiness, escapades that were invariably successful in spite of the constant watchfulness of his jealous "ox-eyed" or sometimes "dog-eyed" spouse. . . If this person also learned of the fierce adventures of Mars, and the complex mutual involvement of gods and heroes expressing themselves in terms of action and unvarying numbers, he would have been a participant in the process of mythical knowledge. This knowledge would have been transmitted by his elders, confirmed by holy commands, rehearsed by symbolic experiences in the form of musical rites and performances involving his whole people. He would have found it easier to respect than comprehend, but it would have led to an idea of the overall texture of the cosmos. In his own person, he would have been part of a genuine theory of cosmology, one he had absorbed by heart, that was responsive to his emotions, and one that could act on his aspirations and dreams. This kind of participation in ultimate things, now extremely difficult for anyone who has not graduated in astrophysics, was then possible to some degree for everyone, and nowhere could it be vulgarized That is what is meant here by mythical knowledge. It was understood only by a very few, it appealed to many, and it is forever intractable for those who approach it through "mathematics for the million" or by speculations on the unconscious. In other words, this is a selective and difficult approach, employing the means at hand and much thought, limited surely, but resistant to falsification. How, in former times, essential knowledge was transmitted on two or more intellectual levels can be learned from Germaine Dieterlen's Introduction to, Marcel Griaule's Conversations with Ogotemmêli, which deals with Dogon education and with the personal experience of the members of La Mission Griaule, who had to wait sixteen years before the sage old men of the tribe decided to "open the door." [n3 M. Griaule, Conversations with Ogotemmêli (1965), pp. xiv- vii.] The description is revealing enough to be quoted in full: In African societies which have preserved their traditional organization the number of persons who are trained in this knowledge is quite considerable. This they call "deep knowledge" in contrast with "simple knowledge" which is regarded as "only a beginning in the understanding of beliefs and customs" that people who are not fully instructed in the cosmogony possess. ..." (Hamlet’s Mill (1969, Pages 52-53).)



Unfortunately, the anthropological work of Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen is now known not to be reliable. The Dutch anthropologist Walter van Beck (1991) who investigated/studied the Dogon long after Marcel Griaule found very little of the sort of knowledge and philosophical viewpoint that had been reported by Griaule, and also found that much of what Griaule had reported (1965) was inconsistent with other Dogon ethnography reported by the Griaule team. (Griaule's study was part of a joint effort with other French anthropologists.) However, this does not affect what the authors of Hamlet's Mill believed concerning how mythology was used and understood at various levels within a society. It does, however, affect the integrity of their claims and conclusions.
The Dogon fiasco
In the period 1931(3?)-1936 the first expeditions by ethnographers Michel Leiris, Jean Rouch, Marcel Griaule, and Germaine Dieterlen to Africa (most particularly to the Dogon region of Mali) began. These continued over the next 20 years, before and after the war WWII. The Dogon people were investigated/questioned by Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen between 1931 and 1950. Griaule and Leiris were employed by the Musee de l'Homme (Museum of Man), an anthropological museum in Paris.
The claim that the Dogon had detailed astronomical knowledge relating to the star Sirius and its invisible companion stars originated in the book, The Pale Fox by Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen (1963). After Griaule's untimely death in 1956, the publication of Le Renard pale (the outcome of his own work), was finally finished by Germaine Dieterlen. Basically, it was claimed the myths of the Dogon tribesmen of Mali, West Africa, contain astronomical knowledge taught through oral tradition, dating back thousands of years (supposedly to ancient Egypt) and specifically referencing the star Sirius. According to the general story in the late 1940s, 4 Dogon priests shared their most important secret tradition with two French anthropologists, Marcel Griaule and Germain Dieterlen after they had spent a lengthy apprenticeship living with the tribe. (It is now clear that neither spent full seasons in the field.) These secret traditions were myths about the star system Sirius. (At least Griaule claimed they had been initiated into the secret mysteries of the male Dogon.)
In Hamlet's Mill the authors acknowledge their great debt to Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen, in particular regarding their approach to the astronomical basis of mythology.
An important challenge to Griaule, however, came from the Dutch ethnographer/anthropologist Walter van Beek who was studying the Dogon. In 1991, van Beek led a team of anthropologists to Mali and declared that they found absolutely no trace of the detailed Sirius lore reported by the French anthropologists. (See: "Dogon Restudied: A Field Evaluation of the Work of Marcel Griaule." by Walter van Beek (Current Anthropology, Volume 32, 1991, Pages 139-167).) Van Beek failed to find anyone amongst the Dogon tribe who believed in the detailed astronomical knowledge relating to the star Sirius and its invisible companion stars. Walter van Beek found no evidence that they had any historical advanced knowledge of Sirius. Van Beek points out that Griaule and Dieterlen stand alone in their claims about the Dogon secret knowledge. No other anthropologist supports their opinions. The Dogon total cosmology presented in The Pale Fox is inconsistent with other work. Walter van Beek identifies the most severe criticism of the Griaule ethnography came from the PhD thesis, Mythagogie et Mystification by Dirk Lettens (1971, Nijmegen University). The supposed Dogon view presented by Griaule is indicated to be a view (fiction) developed Griaule and his particular Dogon informant Ogotemméli.
Van Beek believed that Griale himself was the route of contamination of data. The Dogon view Griaule as a forceful personality and impatient for immediate responses. Van Beek reported that Griaule engaged in leading questions and forceful questioning of his Dogon sources and that new myths were created in the process by confabulation. There is a courtesy bias in Dogon responses to direct questions. It further appears that Griaule's personality and techniques were particularly prone to obtaining results that had been contaminated by his own knowledge and views. Van Beek reports that Griaule "confronted his informants with items, be they artifacts, plants, animals, or stars, and expected them to provide adequate information immediately." Further, Griaule displayed "star maps" whilst investigating Dogon knowledge about astronomy. It appears that certain aspects of the Dogon culture render it particularly susceptible to cultural contamination. In view of Griaule's personality and techniques, it can be seen (within the context of Dogon culture to be obliging and helpful) that the risks of obtained contaminated data were particularly high. Van Beek reported that "Dogon culture is oriented towards overt harmony" and "are very slow to correct each other," more senior individuals "are the ones who know and consequently should not be contradicted."
It is the Dogon view that they learned their astronomy regarding Sirius from Griaule and his star maps.
See: "Haunting Griaule: Experiences from the Restudy of the Dogon." by Walter van Beek (History in Africa, Volume 31, 2004, Pages 43-68).
The Dogon mythology and cosmology per Marcel Griaule were a key foundation for the validity of Hamlet's Mill. As example: See Page vii (Preface) where de Santillana briefly describes von Dechend's acceptance of the ethnographic work with the Dogon that was being reported by Marcel Griaule. De Santillana and von Dechend were convinced that myth is the first scientific discourse, and this is the core thesis of Hamlet's Mill. "Like Levi-Strauss, in Hamlet's Mill, Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend suggested a higher intellectual exercise behind myth in so-called primitive society, explaining that ancient peoples were capable of much more complex thought than we tend to imagine. The book's thesis revolves around several key notions. It affirmed that ancient peoples were capable of extremely meticulous and accurate observation. At the same time, it identified astronomical knowledge as the origin of mythical imagery, observing that the world is mainly constituted of sky, rather than earth: 'Myth is essentially cosmological. As heaven in the cosmos is so vastly more important than our earth, it should not be surprising to find the main functions deriving from heaven'. Although they supported in part the anthropological analysis of myth, which revealed its complexity and the depth of ancient thought, the authors believed that the discipline was overall disregarding some of the aspects of myth. ... The book drew on a wide variety of material collected by the two authors to attempt a universal argument, and to discuss the similarities and the discrepancies that can be made out as to the ancient and the modern experience of the world. From their study, three conclusions seemed to emerge. The first consists in recognising that there is a continuity in the endeavour to understand humankind alongside the universe: 'What [archaic cosmology] did was to mark out the unity of the universe, and of man's mind, reaching out to its farthest limits. Truly, man is doing the same today’. The second is, that despite this continuity, having lost the anchors provided by a time connoted with a sense of destiny, modern man loses his grasp on the cosmos: ‘Modern man is facing the nonconceivable. Archaic man, however, kept a firm grip on the conceivable by framing within his cosmos an order of time and an eschatology that made sense to him and reserved a fate for his soul'. The third one is a sense of an inherited and preserved wisdom of a ruling-class: 'The memory of an ancient nobility is the means of preserving the arcana imperii, the arcana legis and the arcana mundi, just as it was in ancient Rome'. The project of Hamlet's Mill was thus far greater than a mere cosmological study, or a treatise on comparative mythology: 'Spirito scientifico e spirito metafisico non sono forme simboliche che possiedono via autonoma separata, bensi aspetti di una totalita che nelle diverse epoche storiche assumono tratti e specificita le piu diverse, ma che un legame spesso invisibile riesce a tenere uniti e che e compito dello storico svelare'. Another important statement of the book concerns the relation between myth and history. The authors traced the tradition of demythologisation to the practice of historiography, and more specifically to the historiography that tries to incorporate myth and de-code its supposed temporal message." (Italo Calvino: Mythical Writing in an Enlightened World by Myrto Petsota (2012, Unpublished PhD Thesis, The University of Edinburgh, Pages 31-32.)



But de Santillana gave a more expansive interpretation:

This type of analysis originates solely from Giorgio de Santillana.
How old really are fairy-tales?
Both Matt Kane and William Thompson were not informed regarding modern research into the origin and nature of fairy tales. Whether nursery rhymes and fairy tales are some surviving remnant of an ancient oral tradition (especially conveying some form of scientific/astronomical wisdom) has now become even more controversial. There is a strong case that both are relatively modern and have their roots in the medieval period. (Interestingly, so-called fairy tales most often have little to do with fairies). See especially: Fairy Tales: A New History by Ruth Bottigheimer (2009). From the Back Cover: "Where did Cinderella come from? Puss in Boots? Rapunzel? The origins of fairy tales are looked at in a new way in these highly engaging pages. Conventional wisdom holds that fairy tales originated in the oral traditions of peasants and were recorded for posterity by the Brothers Grimm during the nineteenth century. Ruth B. Bottigheimer overturns this view in a lively account of the origins of these well-loved stories. Charles Perrault created Cinderella and her fairy godmother, but no countrywoman whispered this tale into Perrault's ear. Instead, his Cinderella appeared only after he had edited it from the book of often amoral tales published by Giambattista Basile in Naples. Distinguishing fairy tales from folktales and showing the influence of the medieval romance on them, Bottigheimer documents how fairy tales originated as urban writing for urban readers and listeners. Working backward from the Grimms to the earliest known sixteenth-century fairy tales of the Italian Renaissance, Bottigheimer argues for a book-based history of fairy tales. The first new approach to fairy tale history in decades, this book answers questions about where fairy tales came from and how they spread, illuminating a narrative process long veiled by surmise and assumption." Author information also from the back cover: Ruth Bottigheimer [2009] teaches European fairy tales and British children's literature at Stony Brook University, State University of New York. She is the author of several books, including Fairy Godfather: Straparola, Venice, and the Fairy Tale Tradition. Author information from Wikipedia: "Ruth B. Bottigheimer is a literary scholar, folklorist, and author. She is currently an adjunct professor in the department of Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies at Stony Brook University, State University of New York where she specializes and teaches courses in European fairy tales and British children's literature. (Earlier, Albert Wesselski (1871-1939) rejected the theory that the literary fairy tale originated from an oral tradition.) See the book review at http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.php?

See also the critical book review: "Fairy Tales: A New History (review)" by Cristina Bacchilega (Children's Literature Association Quarterly, Volume 35, Number 4, Winter, 2010, Pages 468-471). Two other critical examinations are: "The Invention of Fairy Tales." by Francisco Vaz da Silva (Journal of American Folklore, Volume 123, Number 490, Fall, 2010, Pages 398-425); and "Straparola and the Fairy Tale: Between Literary and Oral Traditions." by Jan Ziolkowski (Journal of American Folklore, Volume 123, Number 490, Fall, 2010, Pages 377-397). The works of Giovan-Francesco Straparola (16th-century) and Charles Perrault (1628-1703) were well-known to the Grimm brothers. "... the Grimm Brothers, [Hans] Anderson and [Charles] Perrault recorded and rewrote some of the "contes de fées" originally told and written by women in the French salons.... ... The tales recorded by [Charles] Perrault and the Grimm Brothers ... are often revisions of the oral tales that originated from various geographical and cultural sources." (Slabbert, Matilda. (2009). "Inventions and Transformations" In: Bobby, Susan. (Editor). Fairy Tales Reimagined. (Page 68).) See also, Beveridge, Jan. (2014). Children Into Swans. Fairy Tales and the Pagan
Imagination. The author believes that fairy tales/stories have commonality between different geographic locations and originate in Prehistory.
Perhaps the oldest 'fairy tale' is the Egyptian story of the Tale of Two brothers. The story dates from the reign of Seti II who ruled from 1200 to 1194 BCE during the 19th Dynasty of the New Kingdom. The story is preserved on the Papyrus D'Orbiney, which is currently preserved in the British Museum. The story is similar in form to the European folktale. The "Tale of Two Brothers" describes a rite of passage, telling the nearly universal story of a handsome and chaste young shepherd who rejects seduction by a powerful older woman and, after many adventures, becomes king. See: The Ancient Egyptian Tale of Two Brothers: The Oldest Fairy Tale in the World by Susan Hollis (2008).
For a critical account of the work of the Grimm brothers, see: Clever Maids: The Secret History of the Grimm Fairy Tales by Valerie Paradiz (2005). (Fairytales diffuse so extremely easily; most of Grimm's are French, brought in by Huguenots.) Also, Why Fairy Tales Stick by Jack Zipes (2006), which is both critical of the Grimm brothers and Ruth Bottigheimer. However, the Marxist folklorist Zipes writes (2006, Page 43): "... there is no such thing as a "pure" national folk tale or literary fairy tale, and neither genre, the oral folk tale or the literary fairy tale - if one can call them separate genres - is a "pure breed"; in fact they are both very much mixed breeds, and ... they "contaminated" each other historically through cross-cultural and intercultural exchange ....." Zipes also writes (2006, Page 44): "There is no evidence that a separate oral wonder-tale tradition or literary fairy-tale tradition existed in Europe before the medieval period." Graham Anderson, Fairy Tale in the Ancient World (2000) made a case for how Greek and Roman myths contributed to the generic development of the literary fairy tale. Earlier, Bengt Holbek, Interpretation of Fairy Tales (1987) linked some forms of the fairy tale with oral tradition existing several millennia earlier. However, see the informed (Englishlanguage) critical/skeptical book review by Christine Goldberg (Professor, University of the Cumberlands in KY) (Bryn Mawr Classical Review, 2001.03.23). Some significant comments include: "The fewer texts there are, the more similar to each other they must be to justify calling them variants of a type. Single texts are useless for proving traditionality (thus Apuleius's Cupid and Psyche has generated controversy), and two or three versions, unless they resemble each other quite closely, are unreliable evidence for traditionality. In contrast to modern tales, which are often abundant, ancient sources seldom include even a few versions of a single tale type. Furthermore, ancient myths and stories are seldom as similar to modern ones as the modern ones are to each other. ... The present belief is that, after a very few early examples, the corpus of modern magical fairy tales begins to appear in Europe only in the twelfth century. And even as late as Straparola's (1550-53) and Basile's (1634-6) collections, when the genre of the magic tale is clearly established, episodes often combine in different ways from what we see in the tales of Perrault (16941697) and the Grimms (1812-1815 and later)." See also the sympathetic but critical (English-language) book reviews by Donald Lateiner (Ohio Wesleyan University) in Scholia Reviews, New Series, Volume 13, 2004, Page 33; and by William Hansen (Professor Emeritas, Classical Studies, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN) posted on Journal of Folklore Research Reviews (IUScholarWorks Journal), 2001. Basically, the case for tracing fairy tales back to the ancient world is not readily convincing. (The earliest collection of tales similar to European folk/fairy tales is the vast multi-volume collection titled Kathasaritasagara, put together in India circa 1063-1081 by Somadeva Bhatta, a Kashmir Brahmin. It contains stories with elements familiar in modern European folk/fairy tales. An earlier Hindu collection of stories is titled Panchatantra, dating to the 5thcentury CE. See: Panchatantra by Theodor Benfey (1859, 2 Volumes. Benfey was a German scholar of Sanskrit and the originator of the Indian origin of European narrative folklore.) The French medieval scholar Ralph Howard Bloch has wittily satirized the "diffusionist" school in his
book, The Scandal of the Fabliaux (1986). Jack Zipes also translated The Complete Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm (1987) with an introduction and notes. During the 18th and 19th centuries there was an effort by a variety of persons to recover the assumed "pure" and natural tales of rural/agrarian people in order to establish national cultural identities (= imagined nations). The more than 200 'folk' tales collected by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were obtained from friends of their sister. These were mostly educated young women of their own middle class social set; and a few young (educated) aristocratic women. Over half their tales came from these sources. Many were originally told in some kind of dialect and were translated by the Grimm brothers into High German. Also, due to their use of the Hassenptlug family (of Huguenot ancestry), and the French influence during the French occupation of the Rhineland at this period, many of the tales were French in origin. The tales were not folk tales but rather 'upper class, city dweller tales.' Numerous variants of the tales influenced the shaping of the stories, as did the culture, politics, and customs



of their day. Through the succeeding editions of their book they fused details of different versions of a folktale together. The final (large) edition (= reworking) of Children's and Household Tales [Kinder- und Hausmärchen] - containing 210 tales - appeared in 1857 and many stories differed in form to the 1 volume (2 volumes in 1) 1819 edition. (The original 1812-1815 2 volume edition did not cater to young readers.) "In their methods too the luster of the brothers has dimmed. Through the successive editions of the Märchen, Wilhelm steadily veered from the concept of fidelity to the spoken text toward an ideal synthetic tale, adapted from the available variants and refined in his editorial hand. Consequently, he abandoned the Volksmärchen or true folktale collected exactly from the lips of the storyteller for the Buchmärchen or literary version shaped by the editor. To perfect stories, he did not scruple to add dialogue, nicknames, homely phrases, whole episodes. ... Nor did the brothers rest content with producing composite texts; they selected stories from literary sources lacking a proper foundation in folk tradition, and so misrepresented the repertoire of German Märchen. Some of the best-known and most frequently reprinted of the Grimm tales, like "Little Red Riding Hood" and "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," are Buchmärchen rather than Volksmärchen. (Folktales of Germany edited by Kurt Ranke (1966; Foreward by Richard Dawson, Pages xvii-xviii).) Also, the Grimm brothers borrowed tales ("The Sleeping Beauty," "Cinderella," "Little Red Ridinghood," and "Tom Thumb") from Histoires ou contes du temps passé (1797) by Charles Perrault.
Note: A male Cinderella story known as Haveloc the Dane was widely disseminated in the Middle Ages. See: The Anglo-Norman Lay of Haveloc edited by Glyn Burgess and Leslie Brook (2015). The story was written down independently and inserted in chronicles, though with a great variety of different dates and names. Various shorter versions of the legend exist in French, Middle English, and Latin. Haveloc, the heir to the Danish throne, is saved from death by Grim who is variously a fisherman or a baron. Grim takes Haveloc to England and they survive a pirate attack on the way. In England, Grim founds the city of Grimsby. Haveloc ends up working as a scullery boy for an English king, but gradually discovers his true identity and reclaims his kingdom and becoming king of Denmark. During this time he marries Argentille (also called Goldeburgh), an English princess who has similarly been dispossessed. This results in Haveloc also becoming king of England.
The concept of folk-tales containing the 'debris/flotsam' of pre-Christian beliefs - and a window to the beliefs of the past - began with the work of the Grimm brothers. The Grimm brothers introduced the de-evolutionary premise into folklore. They proposed that present-day folklore tales are the detritus (remains) of a more ancient and much greater body of lore. The concept was renewed by Hertha von Dechend. "Between 1690 and 1715, well over one hundred literary fairy tales appeared in France, two-thirds of them written by women. This book explores why fashionable adults were attracted to this new literary genre and considers how it became a medium for reconceiving literary and historical discourses of sexuality and gender. Integrating socio-historical, structuralist, and post-structuralist approaches, Seifert argues that these fairy tales use the "marvelous" (or supernatural) to mediate between conflicting cultural desires, particularly between nostalgia and Utopian longings. The first part of the book considers how the marvelous is used to legitimize the genre, to espouse waning aristocratic ideals, to exemplify theories of "modern" (as opposed to ancient classical) culture, and to reaffirm women's potential as writers. The second part examines how specific groups of tales both reiterate and unsettle late seventeenth-century discourses of love, masculinity, and femininity, through literary and/or folkloric conventions such as the romantic quest, the marriage closure, chivalric heroes, and good and evil fairies. Seifert's study sheds new light on the development of the literary fairy tale and proposes a new approach to understanding sexuality and gender both in this genre and the ancien regime as a whole." (Fairy Tales, Sexuality, and Gender in France 1690-1715: Nostalgic Utopias by Lewis Seifert (1996). Publisher's blurb. At the time of publication the author was in the Department of French Studies, Brown University.)
Note: Modern research has established that many of the tales collected by the Grimm brothers actually derive from printed sources. Not many of their informants were rustic story tellers.
According to Bill Lauritzen (The Invention of God: The Origins of Religious and Scientific Thought, 2007), much of Hamlet's Mill can be interpreted as describing volcanic and geological processes.
An example of the need for caution
An interesting example for caution is the Jack and Jill nursery rhyme. The source claiming an astronomical origin for this story is quite recent. The claim first appears in the book, Curious Myths of the Middle Ages by Sabine Baring-Gould (1866). He also claims the names Jack and Jill have a Norse origin. He does not give any earlier sources. Apparently the astronomical interpretation and the origin of the names is his invention. BaringGould has been criticised for unreliability i.e., mischievously inventing facts on a few matters. In their book, Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (1951), Iona and Peter Opie remark that the names Jack and Jill are not unique to any one particular nursery rhyme, they are used in the general sense of lad and lass, and it is highly unlikely that all the instances of Jack and Jill in early modern literature could be traced back to Norse mythology.
Process for the successful interpretation of fairy-tales
The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales by Maria Tatar (1987, Pages 42-43): "The critic who undertakes the task of interpreting a tale without first studying the relation of a folkloric text to its variant forms may find himself drawing generalizations based on false premises. The Prairie Band Potawatomi may be able to state with impunity that the folktale hero P'teejah is a full-blooded American Indian boy, but the folklorist who fails to recognize that P'teejah is the French folk hero Petit Jean masquerading as an Indian will find himself drawing embarrassing conclusions about Amerindian culture. When Bruno Bettelheim and Ernest Jones analyze the symbolic significance of a prince's transformation into a frog by telling us that the "clammy sensations" aroused by frogs link those creatures to the male sexual organ, they both willfully ignore the fact that an entire set of stories features frogs that turn out to be enchanted princesses. And when Erich Fromm insists that the bottle carried by Little Red Riding Hood on the way to her grandmother's house stands as a symbol of virginity (hence the warning not to break it) and proceeds to build an entire interpretation of the story based on this and a few other details, he seems to have failed to take into account the many versions with neither bottle nor admonition. Any attempt to unearth the hidden meaning of fairy tales is bound to fail unless it is preceded by a rigorous, if not exhaustive, analysis of a tale type and its variants. That analysis enables the interpreter to distinguish essential features from random embellishments and to identify culturally determined elements that vary from one regional version of a tale to the next."
Folk-tales are highly elaborate and sophisticated stories (little novels). The Grimm brothers were editors and revisers of folktales. They changed the content of the tales multiple times. The first academic study of their editing procedures (and still the standard) was Ammerhungen zu den Kinder- und Hausmärchen der Brüder Grimm by the German scholar Johannes Bolte (1858-1937) and the Czech scholar Jiří (Georg) Polívka (1838-1933) published in 5 Volumes, 1913-1932, reprinted 1963. Also important is the retired German scholar Heinz Rölleke who has published multiple works on the same subject. But see his excellent (English-language) essay in The Brothers Grimm and Folktale edited by James McGlathery (1991). Heinz Rölleke (1936- ), Emeritus der Bergischen Universität Wuppertal, is a German Germanist specialising in German philology and folklore. He is a renowned researcher of the Brothers Grimm. His important studies include:

Recent comparative phylogenetic analyses of Indo-European folktales
Da Silva, Sara Graça. and Tehrani, Jamshid J. (2016). "Comparative phylogenetic analyses uncover the ancient roots of Indo-European folktales." Royal Society Open Science, 3: 150645. (Open access journal, published online only. Article published 20 January 2016. http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/1/150645) A modern linguistic analysis of a small number of fairytales. The authors conclude that several Indo-European fairytales can be traced back to circa 4000-500 BCE. The authors express their findings in terms of "likelihood." Abstract: "Ancient population expansions and dispersals often leave enduring signatures in the cultural traditions of their descendants, as well as in their genes and languages. The international folktale record has long been regarded as a rich context in which to explore these legacies. To date, investigations in this area have been complicated by a lack of historical data and the impact of more recent waves of diffusion. In this study, we introduce new methods for tackling these problems by applying comparative phylogenetic methods and autologistic modelling to analyse the relationships between folktales, population histories and geographical distances in Indo-European-speaking societies. We find strong correlations between the distributions of a number of folktales and phylogenetic, but not spatial, associations among populations that are consistent with vertical processes of cultural inheritance. Moreover, we show that these oral traditions probably originated long before the emergence of the literary record, and find evidence that one tale ('The Smith and the Devil') can be traced back to the Bronze Age. On a broader level, the kinds of stories told in ancestral societies can provide important insights into their culture, furnishing new perspectives on linguistic, genetic and archaeological reconstructions of human prehistory."

Methodological problems
Lacking entirely from Panbabylonism and Hamlet's Mill is any attempt at chronological order in the development/diffusion of world myths that are used by the various authors to argue their respective cases. Nothing is discussed regarding the historical development of mythical conceptions, their earliest beginnings, and their gradual elaboration and distinct formulation. Hugo Winckler conceded that nothing was known regarding how Babylonian ideas/teachings spread throughout the world and became dominant. Implied though was diffusion through migration and amazingly long sea voyages even in (at least) the Neolithic period. The simple fact is that certain world-wide myths are astral. The astral element of the Panbabylonism/Hamlet's Mill theory is based upon arbitrary parallelisms carried out without regard to establishing historical conditions. According to Stucken it was the motif only that was passed. Stucken's parallels are gathered from all over the world, but these parallels – though numerous – are often only very incidental.
The likelihood of multiple explanations for the origin of myths is ignored in Hamlet's Mill. The Sampson myth is related to fire. Fire plays an important role throughout Sampson's story.
Whilst holding that myths were used to transmit astronomical information orally any difficulties associated with oral transmission are not discussed.
Jarita Holbrook, guest post Cosmos Diary blog, June 1, 2012 writes: "The idea of myths and legends possibly containing scientific truths about the sky is not new. Studies trying to tease out astronomy facts from the narrative of myths have been fraught with methodological errors center around the question of 'what myths are the best candidates for having astronomy content?' Books have been written in answer to this question that offer guidelines for identifying celestial motifs in myths across cultures. My 2008 analysis of African creation myths focused on identifying common cosmological themes that appear in more than one ethnic group. For that study, the myths selected were chosen from published sources—which can present problems that should be taken into consideration. For example, oftentimes the person recording the myth has: a) combined several versions of the myth into one version for simplicity, and b) changed the language used in the myth in order for it to read better for academic audiences. It is rare to impossible to find original transcriptions of African creation myths." (Jarita Holbrook is a researcher at UCLA (2012) and among the first African American women to earn a doctorate in astrophysics in the USA.)
Andrew Dalby in his book Rediscovering Homer (2006, Page 191) writes (regarding epic poem transmission): "Parry and his followers showed, then, that singers learn from their predecessors the poetic language, the system of formulas, the traditional stories and characters. What they do not learn from each other is the precise wording of a story or poem. Whole poems are not transmitted from one poet to another." Applied to the concept of hyper-diffusion of precessional mythology from Mesopotamia the inevitable variations in accuracy from an original version poses problems of a garbled code.
Neolithic period diffusion
Lacking entirely from Panbabylonism and Hamlet's Mill is any attempt at chronological order in the development/diffusion of world myths that used by the various authors to argue their respective cases. Hugo Winckler conceded that nothing was known regarding how Babylonian ideas/teachings spread throughout the world. Implied though was diffusion through amazingly long sea voyages even in (at least) the Neolithic period.
Also, though supposedly a world-wide culture existed - the only influence originated from Mesopotamia. There was no other seat of myth, astronomical improvement, or influence. Apparently we are to believe the method and purpose of transmission of the complex monomyth through obscure storytelling remained constant/the same.
Issues with Neolithic period diffusion
The attempt to reach so far back into prehistory passes beyond texts able to control the inquiry to perhaps archaeological evidence if not used selectively. However, the strategy of interpretation consists primarily of 19th-century philological arguments.
Features of diffusion that need to be established are not just the spread of culture traits but also the factors contributing to the spread (i,e., how it is achieved), the response it evokes in the culture it spreads to, and the issue of adaptations (if any) required for the acceptance of the trait and why this assumes significance. Ralph Linton in his flawed book (The Study of Man (1936)) identifies 3 processes by which diffusion takes place: (1)



presentation of new culture element(s) to the society; (2) acceptance by society; and (3) integration of the accepted element(s) into the pre-existing culture.
The following are major issues connected with diffusion that were ignored by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend still need to be discussed by proponents of Hamlet’s Mill:
(1) The nature and extent of diffusion of an idea largely depending on its acceptance by another culture. Why would cultures readily understand and accept a complex monomyth that they were unable to invent and likely unable to use or use fully?
(2) The acceptance of a culture trait likely depending on two principal factors: (a) usefulness and (b) compatibility with the traits of the culture which accepts it. A trait or idea which is in sharp conflict with the traits/beliefs of the potential receiving culture is unlikely to be accepted.
(3) The successful diffusion of any culture trait or idea likely depending upon actual contact between cultures. It is unlikely that a culture that exists in almost complete isolation from another culture wil incorporate traits or ideas that belong to other cultures. In other words, the greater the physical distance between 2 cultures the less likelihood there is that diffusion would take place between them.
(4) The changes or modifications in a culture trait or idea (that is undergoing diffusion or or has already undergone diffusion and reached other cultures). In the course of its diffusion the astronomical monomyth may have been modified by inclusion of other ideas and these got diffused too.
(5) Waves of diffusion affecting held ideas. How exactly did the astronomical monomyth remain stable within cultures subject to multiple waves of diffusion?
The assumption is that myths are perhaps adapted but never remade. There is no basis for this assumption.
An example of lack of evidence for early diffusion of astronomy
There is no evidence that the earliest Mesopotamian constellations/star names, dating to the 3rd millennium BCE, were an influence on the uranography/cosmology of the ancient Iranians of that period. Early Iranian constellations/star names are almost non-existent. Nowhere in the Gathas (17 hymns believed to have been composed by Zoroaster) or the Old Persian inscriptions of the Achaemenids are even individual stars mentioned. The first and only 2 constellations to be named in Old Iranian sources are Ursa Major and the Pleiades, in the Younger Avesta. Their names are clearly indigenous and not taken over from Babylonian constellations, as were later Iranian constellations/star names. (Their names, haptōiringa (Persian Haft-owrang), literally "having seven marks," and paoiryaēinyas (New Persian Parvīn), derivative of paoirya- meaning "first.") The date of the first occurrence of Iranian constellation names is not established but is deemed likely to date to the prehistory of eastern Iran. By the Sassanian Period/Era (224-651 CE) the concept of the Zodiac had been borrowed from Greece. (The 12 signs of the zodiac correspond in concept to the Greek designations.) The 2nd (and 5th?) chapter of the Pahlavi Bundahishn (which dates to the Islamic Period) contains the names of the 12 signs of the Greek zodiac. (The Bundahishn is a Persian encyclopaedia that was completed in 1178 CE.) (Article: "Constellations." in Encyclopaedia Iranica, Volume VI, Fascicle 2, 1987, Pages 147-150.)
The Germanic languages (a branch of the Indo-European language family; not to be confused simply with the German language) have no indigenous planet names except "the Morning Star" and "the Evening Star" for Venus. The common ancestor of all of the languages in this branch is called Proto-Germanic (also known as Common Germanic), which was spoken in about the middle of the 1st-millennium BCE in Iron Age Scandinavia. Early varieties of Germanic entered history with the Germanic tribes moving south from Scandinavia in the 2nd-century BCE, to settle in the area of present-day northern Germany and southern Denmark.
James Frazer and Hamlet's Mill
Like Frazer's The Golden Bough (1935) Hamlet's Mill is constructed haphazardly on the basis of selective evidence taken from around the world.
According to von Dechend (and de Santillana?) enlightened and immensely informed guidance is to be found in James Frazer, Jane Harrison, Arthur Cooke, and others comprising the Myth and Ritual School, and the fascinating (but imaginative) conjectures of Robert Graves. (See: Introduction to Cosmology: A Preliminary Reconnaissance. (1961, Page 57).) The Canadian literary critic and literary theorist Northrop Frye (1912-1991) was an enthusiastic supporter of the Myth and Ritual School. (See: Northrop Frye on Myth: An Introduction by Ford Russell (1998).)
"The Great Cosmological Doctrines." by Giorgio de Santillana. In: Science and Synthesis: An International Colloquium organized by Unesco on the Tenth Anniversary of the Death of Albert Einstein and Teilhard de Chardin [1967]. (1971, Pages 37-45, Page 43).
In his presentation to the International Colloquium organized by UNESCO on the Tenth Anniversary of the Death of Albert Einstein and Teilhard de Chardin, de Santillana presented on the themes of Hamlet's Mill. He also voiced his support for James Frazer, Jane Harrison, Arthur Cooke, and the Myth and Ritual School. Interestingly, de Santillana states his belief that the source of the "universal mythical language" was proto-historic Mesopotamia and that he is unable to offer an explanation for how this astronomical code code travelled by diffusion. In mentioning "the Ecliptic and its constellations" de Santillana obviously (and erroneously) believes in a very ancient zodiac.
James Frazer, in the role of a myth-ritualist, influenced the Myth and Ritual School/Cambridge Ritualists to take an anthropological and comparativist approach to myth, ritual, and religion. Interestingly, the Myth and Ritual School/Cambridge Ritualists argued that the ancient Greeks were far closer to primitives than had been assumed - were more like primitives than moderns. Two issues. Frazer has influenced/reinforced von Dechend's particular comparativist approach to myth. Also, with Hamlet's Mill the Greeks comprise something of a borderline. According to de Santillana Plato could "speak the language of archaic myth" and built the first modern philosophy on this foundation. De Santillana believed that behind Plato's myths was his knowledge of the 'ancient system' and that Plato used this language in his allegories - "without divulging their precise meaning: whoever was entitled to the knowledge of the proper terminology would understand him." The collapse of the claimed world-wide coding system - it simply becoming debris - is held to have been completed with the rise of Greco-Roman civilization. The authors of Hamlet's Mill write (Page 345): "With the remnants of the system scattered all over the world, abandoned to the drift of cultures and languages, it is immensely difficult to identify the original themes that may have undergone so many sea-changes." Their basic position is that ancient myths are the remains of preliterate astronomy that became lost (at least in Western Europe) with the rise of Greco-Roman civilisation. Perhaps their perception was that since the Greeks the language we commonly use for science and scientific description, and mythology, have developed separately.

There are several key influences behind Frazer's The Golden Bough. James Frazer (1854-1941) was greatly influenced by the comparative mythologist Wilhelm Mannhardt (1831-1880) who was greatly influenced by Friedrich Max Müller (1823-1900) a philologist and Orientalist. Comparative mythology is the offspring of comparative philology. The main exponent of comparative mythology was the German comparative philologist Max Müller who used the methods of comparative philology to study myths. After working on comparative linguistics Müller wanted to establish comparative mythology and comparative religion on that as a basis. He held that philological and etymological research can discover the meaning of early religion by restoring the original sense to the names of the gods/goddesses and the stories told about them. Between circa 1860 and circa 1880 the ideas of Müller dominated. The anthropological approach to mythology eventually became established after WWI. It has been identified that Frazer's The Golden Bough was directly inspired by Edward Tylor's theory of cultural survivals first set out in his Primitive Culture (1871). (Tylor adopted the German social philosopher Gustav Klemm's (1802-1867) term, "culture," as a preferable term to "civilization.") Tylor distinguished between continuing customs that maintained their function or meaning and those that had both lost their utility and were poorly integrated with the rest of culture. The latter he termed "survivals." Tylor argued that elements of early culture that had outlived the set of conditions under which they had developed (lost their utility) continued on in later stages of cultural development as "survivals." Tylor believed that seemingly irrational customs and beliefs, such as peasant superstitions, were vestiges of earlier rational practices. Superstitions, nursery rhymes, or familiar expressions ("a pig in a poke") often are illogical and unintelligible. Tylor argued that such aspects of modern life are survivals from mythology or rituals that served a purpose in the past but had lost their meaning over time, even as the practice itself continued. Tylor later expanded the notion of survivals to include material culture. Among the examples of material survivals that Tylor invoked was men’s formal wear, specifically the styling of the men's tailcoat, as an example in which vestiges of a past item - in this case the greatcoat, with its waist-length front and split tail for ease in riding horses - had survived into the present time. For Tylor, the most apparently insignificant aspects of modern life (in his time this was Victorian life) were critical to anthropology. Cultural survivals were "... landmarks in the course of culture. ... On the strength of these survivals, it becomes possible to declare that the civilization of the people they are observed among must have been derived from an earlier state, in which the proper home and meaning of these things are to found; and thus collections of such facts are to be worked as mines of historic knowledge." (Primitive Culture, Volume 1, Page 71.) Hence, reuniting survivals with their lost meaning was the key to understanding the true nature of the primitive mind.
A modern proponent of survivals and their remaining integration with the rest of society was the Polish-British anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski who strongly rejected the view that any part of a culture could be without function or could be disconnected from the rest of the cultural system.
George Gomme (1853-1916, a British public servant and leading folklorist) criticised Frazer for his "free linkage of customs and rites from unlike cultures." The criticism applies to Hamlet's Mill. Support for Hamlet's Mill has come from scholars unaware of the scholarly difficulties and the general public who are indifferent to the scholarly difficulties.
Hamlet's Mill, like a number of books before and since its publication, is a return to the type of speculative claims of Frazerian comparative mythology (i.e., the tenets of the multi-volume The Golden Bough (first published 1890)) and its claims for the longevity of prehistoric traditions and the antiquity of medieval myths, epics, and tales. (Note: Frazer was not the originator of the ritual approach to myth.) Other examples are: From Ritual to Romance by Jessie Weston (1920); The Gate of Horn by Levy Rachel (1948); and Archaeology and Celtic Myth by John Waddell (2014). See also: Viking Archaeology in Iceland: Mosfell Archaeological Project edited by Davide Zori and Jesse Byock (2014). "This book represents the full publication of a remarkable archaeological excavation project, conducted over multiple seasons in the Mosfell Valley and its central church and farm at Hrísbrú, a spectacular landscape environment not far from Reykjavík in south-western Iceland. Mosfell is well-known from the medieval saga literature, Iceland's great national literary tradition, and is described in the anonymous saga of Egill Skalla-Grímsson as the location of the hero's home. Egill is one of the most spectacular figures of the Viking period, even by the standards of a dramatic age, a quintessential warrior-poet, sorcerer and worshipper of the war-god Odin. While the veracity of the saga has long been open to question, the printthe-Legend story has a power all its own. Many Icelanders today are blood relatives of the man himself, and it is fair to say that any archaeological investigation of the reality behind the myth is a subject of national concern in this North Atlantic country of just over 300,000 people. Over the last decade or so the Mosfell project has thus generated a deal of controversy, largely due to the perception (of some) that its objective is 'looking for Egill' and thereby following in the long tradition of saga-oriented fieldwork, rather than the properly objective analysis--as if such a thing could exist--of a valley and its people over time. Along the way, fresh argument has been sparked by the excavators' claims to have found the partial remains of a cremation grave--a burial rite almost universal in the Scandinavian homelands but essentially unknown in Iceland, to scholarly mystification." (Extract from book review by Neil Price (University of Uppsala) in The Medieval Review, 4 June 2015.) In the Frazerian approach ancient traditions are believed to survive in later medieval myths, epics, and tales. (For an example of Frazer's influence on early assyriology see: Tammuz and Ishtar by Stephen Langdon (1914).) However, it is totally incorrect to believe the study of mythology has remain unchanged in the last 100 years. Quite the contrary, there has been great change - not little change - theoretically and methodologically in the last 100 years. The study of mythology has changed a great deal just in the past few decades. Note: among modern academic writers something of a Frazerian approach is taken by Philippe Walter (1952- ), Christian Mythology (English translation by Jon Graham 2006). Walter is a professor of medieval French literature. Also, Jacqueline Simpson (1930- ), European Mythology (1987); but without endorsing Frazer's ideas. (Simpson opposes the theories proposed by Margaret Murray.) In 2010 she was appointed Visiting Professor of Folklore at the Sussex Centre of Folklore, Fairy Tales and Fantasy at the University of Chichester, West Sussex.
In his Theorizing Myth (1999), Bruce Lincoln (The University of Chicago) sets out that comparative mythology is a difficult endeavour. First, because comparative mythology is difficult to do well owing to the depth and breadth of knowledge required. Secondly, because the material lends scholars ample opportunity to place their own interpretation on the material. Lincoln scrutinizes the work of previous major scholars on the interpretation of mythology, examining methods and assumptions, and exposing bias and prejudice. Part of the book is also about doing comparative mythology well.
Wendy Doniger, an Indologist at The University of Chicago, and acclaimed comparative mythologist, is also well aware of the pitfalls of writing comparative mythology. Her book, The Implied Spider (1998) is a defense of comparative mythology, specifically in the field of the history of religions: what it is, what it isn't, and why it can and should be done.
Some comments
The theme of Hamlet's Mill is all the great myths from around the world derive from a common astronomical origin and form the basis for cosmic determinism: the relationship between time and cosmos. For this the authors adopted and interpreted the theory of the monomyth. The monomyth was not invented by the authors of Hamlet's Mill but was already existing. (In a variant form it deals with the Journey of the Hero.) The gods/goddesses and mythic places that form the stories of ancient mythic tales - and into the middle ages - are "stand ins" for universally recognised celestial phenomena that date back to circa 5000 BCE (deemed "golden age") when the calendar and constellations (most importantly, the evenly spaced 12-constellation zodiac) were established, and precessional movement of the equinoxes became known. Supposedly the global reach and influence of an astronomical monomyth prevailed during the first 4 millennia BCE, even in the Caribbean and Polynesia. Likely, independent invention offers a better explanation than the monomyth.



An over-reliance of Hamlet's Mill on Frazers' The Golden Bough is likely mistaken. Leo Frobenius was also a strong influence. Hamlet's Mill is almost entirely reliant on Panbabylonism. According to Leach both Kulturkreis and Ergriffenheit are indicated as being templates for the narrative structure of Hamlet's Mill.
Modern mythologists overlooked in Hamlet's Mill
The authors of Hamlet's Mill ignored contemporary myth studies.
Since the ancient Greeks numerous systems for interpreting myths have been proposed. No one-size-fits-all explanation seems realistic. The explanation of myth as allegory (having a disguised philosophical or theological meaning) was proposed by some ancient Greeks. (For a modern study of allegory/symbolism in ancient Greek poetry see: Birth of the Symbol: Ancient Readers at the Limits of Their Texts by Peter Struck (2004).) A variation of the allegorical approach to myth was the 'comparative mythology' approach of the 19th-century philologist Max Müller (1823-1900). According to Müller myths were created as an expression of religious awe inspired by natural phenomena. Müller's approach is usually described as 'solar mythology.' Müller's approach was succeeded by James Frazer's approach to 'comparative mythology.' Also, Franz Cumont's approach to the development of the history of religions.
In his multi-volume The Golden Bough, Frazer compared myths of diverse cultures and found numerous similarities between them. The comparatist seeks to identify an 'Urmyth,' the earliest version of a story underlying all later variants. The comparatist assumes: (1) stories with similar themes are the same; they are variants or versions of one another; and (2) there is an original version of the myth, and later examples are distorted versions of an original story. The comparatist intends to reassemble the original version from the surviving corrupted versions. The problem, of course, is the subjectivity in deciding the themes of the hypothetical original myth from what are later additions. There is no way of knowing. Frazer's approach was further developed by Jane Harrison, most noticeably in her book Themis (1912) which examined the link between myth and ritual.
Up to the 2nd-half of the 19th-century - under the influence of founding fathers such as Friedrich Welcker (1784-1868) and Max Müller - the study of ancient religions was approach from a strictly philological perspective. Both Welcker and Müller based their study of ancient religions on language, texts, and mythology. Müller believed (erroneously) he had traced the development of ancient religions from monotheism to polytheism by examining the evolution of the names of the gods. Franz Cumont (1868-1947), a Belgian classicist and historian of religions, was the first scholar who studied one specific ancient religion (Mithraism) from the viewpoint of the entire Altertumswissenschaft. Cumont collected all extant documents related to Mithraism, and also epigraphical and archaeological material.
The 3 20th-century giants whose works remain the most important theoretical contributions to the study of myth are: (1) Georges Dumézil (18981986), Claude Lévī-Strauss (1908-2009), and Mircea Eliade (1907-1986). In the 1920s Georges Dumézil developed a new approach to the comparative method. In 1955 Claude Lévī-Strauss introduced the methodology of 'structuralism.' He also introduced a type of astronomical code (metaphor) in myth (different to Hamlet's Mill); one which interlocks with a sociological code. In his, From Honey to Ashes. Introduction to a Science of Mythology, 2, Lévī-Strauss discusses the "astronomical code" of certain myths. The material in the books is predominantly taken from the Amazon area, the Guianas, the Mato Grosso, and the Chaco. More recent approaches frequently combine structural approaches with more traditional methods. Note: Recently the veracity of some of the work of Eliade has been questioned.
Another important study of myths is Morfologiya Skazki (Morpholology of the Folktale) by the Russian folklorist Vladimir Propp (1928). He found that the number of themes (functions) within 'wondertales' was always (when complete) 31 and the themes (functions) always occur in the same sequence.
Two points. First. The study of myths and their interpretation remains dynamic and is often quite eclectic. There is often much inter-disciplinary activity with scholars researching myths now drawing on ideas from other subject areas. Second. The author's of Hamlet's Mill, like the Star-Myth school and Panbabylonists, propose that myths always refer to celestial phenomena. They do not accept that any ancient people saw anything below the sky - or rather, things on the ground were transferred to the sky and the earlier myths discarded. The dangers inherent in pushing interpretation to this simple extreme should be obvious.
Scott Leonard writes: "Following Malinowski, anthropologists have to greater and lesser degrees, illuminated the relationships among myths, religion, custom, socio-political behaviours, and material culture. ... A principal weakness of literary, psychological, and structuralist approaches is that they are ahistorical; they don't consider the specific material and social conditions that shape myth." Also, Walter Burket has made the point that traditional tales (myths) cannot be interpreted unless the cultural and historical context is factored in. Myth needs to satisfy the needs of both the teller and the audience.
A modern discussion of aspects of mythology in Chavín culture by Chiaki Kanō (1931- ) (University of Gakushuin & the University of Tokyo) in his book, The Origins of Chavín Culture (1979, Page 34).
Modern approaches to mythology
Throughout the lengthy pioneering period of comparative mythology the lack of an organised approach resulted in the introduction of highly speculative theories. In the past few decades there have been great changes in the study of mythology - theoretically and methodologically. The modern study of mythology is an interdisciplinary effort. The modern approach to the study and interpretation of myths has also seen the introduction of caution. This is extended to the examination of parallels, similar motifs, and constants. Likely, the study of mythology will never become an exact science, free from inference and deduction.

Dismissal of Sumerologists
It is unjustified for the authors to call Sumerologists "simple-minded" because through scholarly study they have not reached conclusions that the authors of Hamlet's Mill believe should have reached. It is a highly skilled task to engage in Sumerian philology - a skill that the authors do not have.
The Kalevala
The folklore known as The Kalevala has bewildered scholars since it was first assembled in written form from the various songs of Finnish and Russian bards over 175 years ago.
The Kalevala (or The Kalewala) is a 19th-century work of epic poetry compiled by Elias Lönnrot from Karelian and Finnish oral folklore and mythology. Its special importance in Finland is due to the fact that it is now the centre of Finnish literary studies and the beginning of Finnish literature. Elias Lönnrot based the epic on folksongs. Elias Lönnrot was a Finnish philologist and collector of traditional Finnish oral poetry. He is best known for composing the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic compiled from national folklore. In the early to mid-1800's Elias Lönnrot traveled throughout Finland collecting bardic folk poems and arranging them into what eventually became the Kalevala, Finland's national epic. (When he became ill and unable to travel any longer he invited performers (singers of epic poetry) to visit him and sing their folksongs as he took notes.) Lönnrot was recognised for his part in preserving Finland's oral traditions by appointment to the Chair of Finnish Literature at the University of Helsinki. He died on March 19, 1884 in Sammatti, in the province of Uusimaa.
The Kalevala recounts the adventures of Väinämöinen, the bard/sorcerer; Ilmarenan the magical blacksmith/craftsman; Lemminkäinen (or Lemminki) the rogue; and a number of other characters. The Kalevala begins with the traditional Finnish creation myth leading into stories of the creation of the earth, plants, creatures and the sky. Creation, healing, combat and internal story telling are often accomplished by the character(s) involved singing of their exploits or desires. Many parts of the stories involve a character hunting or requesting lyrics (spells) to acquire some skill, such as boat-building or the mastery of iron making. As well as magical spell casting and singing, there are many stories of lust, romance, kidnapping and seduction. The protagonists of the stories often have to accomplish feats that are unreasonable or impossible which they often fail to achieve leading to tragedy and humiliation.
The Sampo is a pivotal element of the plot of The Kalevala. Many actions and their consequences are caused by the Sampo itself or a character's interaction with the Sampo. It is described as a magical artefact that brings its possessor great fortune and prosperity, but its precise nature has been the subject of continuing debate to the present day. Though of indeterminate type in The Kalevala, the Sampo has been interpreted in many ways. The Sampo is covered by a many-coloured lid (cover) which revolves. Elias Lönnrot interpreted the Sampo to be a quern or mill of some sort that made flour, salt, and gold out of nothing ('thin air'). According to the authors of Hamlet's Mill the Sampo is a great (furnace) mill that is an allegory for the celestial sky and its movement. The authors of Hamlet’s Mill, state that the "Sampo is nothing but heaven itself." According to the authors of Hamlet's Mill the Sampo and the World Pillar both refer to the precession of the equinoxes. The Sampo or precession process is held to grind out different world ages, from dark ages to golden ages and back again over the long precessional cycle. The world pillar hypothesis, originally developed by historian of religions Uno Harva and the linguist Eemil Nestor Setälä in the early 20th century, is the most widely accepted explanation. With the world pillar hypothesis above the earth there is a gigantic dome or canopy of the sky fixed around the 'North Star' and is supported by a gigantic world pillar called Sampo, which reaches down to the centre of the earth. The authors of Hamlet's Mill have added in precessional world ages, for which they offer no satisfactory evidence.
However, the Sampo is coloured, bright and noisy. Andrew Gough proposes the Sampo may have been the Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis, a multi-coloured phenomenon in the sky that is witnessed in northern latitudes.
The Finnish historian Väinö Kaukonen suggested that 3% of The Kalevala's lines are Lönnrot's own composition, as well as 14% being Lönnrot compositions from variants, 50% verses which Lönnrot kept mostly unchanged except for some minor alterations and 33% original unedited oral poetry. However, it is considered impossible to attempt to extrapolate concrete percentages of how much of The Kalevala is genuine word-forword oral tradition and how much was fabricated by Lönnrot. It is recognised that a loose collection of mixed and varied poems all with many possible versions cannot be combined into a single and solid epic without some editing, otherwise The Kalevala would be an anthology and not a national epic. A number of persons believe that the folksongs may be no earlier than the medieval period and subject to editorial alterations by Elias Lönnrot.
There are similarities with mythology and folklore from other cultures, for example the Kullervo character and his story bearing some likeness to the Greek Oedipus. The similarity of the virginal maiden Marjatta to the Christian Virgin Mary is also considered striking. The arrival of Marjatta's son in the final song spelling the end of Väinämöinen's reign over Kalevala is similar to the arrival of Christianity bringing about the end of Paganism in Finland and Europe at large.
Summary: The Kalevala (The Land of Heroes) was a 19th-century book by country doctor Elias Lönnrot in which he speculated that the traditional songs of Karelia were actually fragments of a lost northern epic from thousands of years ago (and so were 19th-century living epic traditions). Lönnrot (who was new to scientific research/ethnology) had spent years exploring the region on sled and by boat in an attempt to restore the supposed epic to its original form. He joined/united them together using episodes of his own writing. A number of Finnish scholars were critical of the liberties that Lönnrot had taken.

Part 5: Claimed support for Hamlet's Mill from recent investigations
Modern feminist writers
It is held by one author that the work of Alexander Marshack (1918-2004, American independent scholar and self-taught Paleolithic archaeologist); Marija Gimbutas (Lithuanian: Marija Gimbutienė, 1921-1994, Lithuanian-American archaeologist); Monica Sjöö (1938-2005, Swedish painter, writer and a radical anarcho/eco-feminist, who, before her death from cancer, was artist and theoretician of the reemerging



Goddess religion); and Barbara Mor (American feminist writer of poetry, essays, and experimental fiction, 'Goddess scholar', co-author with Monica Sjöö of The Great Cosmic Mother (1987, 1991)) give support to Hamlet’s Mill. (See: Obituary: "Monica Sjoo. A feminist artist working to glorify the goddess and the Earth." by Pat West (The Guardian, Friday, 23 September 2005).) Excepting for Marshack they are all feminist writers supporting the idea of an ancient 'great goddess.' Neither Monica Sjoo or Barbara Mor have academic qualifications in archaeology or anthropology. Also, neither has conducted field research nor published academic papers. The critical evaluation of the evidence demonstrates the concept of the 'Mother Goddess' is a fiction.
Marija Gimbutas
The leading proponent/pioneer of the (great/mother) goddess movement was the controversial Lithuanian archaeologist and author (and Goddess feminist historian) Marija Gimbutas (1921-1994), who spent 30 years studying patterns and symbols of cult objects. She also developed the field she referred to as "archeomythology" (embodying the fields of archaeology, comparative mythology, and folklore). Eliade was a supporter of the ideas propounded by Gimbutas.
The archaeologist Marija Gimbutas was born in Lithuania and died in the USA. She was a respected scholar in Indo-European studies of the Bronze and Neolithic periods. Her training was at Tubingen and Harvard universities. She conducted archaeological work at sites such as Sitagroi, Anza and Achilleion and was a prolific writer, publishing numerous books and articles. Her academic work included a melding of language, myth, ethnography and archaeology. Gimbutas taught and conducted research at the University of California at Los Angeles. And she was a fellow of the Peabody Museum at Harvard. Her theories have remained being considered speculative and controversial by fellow scholars involved in the same areas of study. According to Marija Gimbutas Europe's origins lay in a cooperative, peaceful, Neolithic Goddess culture. With the publication in 1969 of Andrew Fleming's watershed (= transition) article "The Myth of the Mother Goddess." – and for other reasons – the theory lapsed into disfavour with archaeologists, with the notable exception of Marija Gimbutas. The belief that there was a female goddess figure (Great/Mother Goddess) in every ancient religion/civilisation which was the primary deity is highly controversial. Gimbutas imposed a single interpretation on widely divergent archaeological material that was also widely divergent in space and time i.e., located at opposite ends of Europe and having a 3000 year time difference. The wide-spread existence of a Bronze Age Mother Goddess descended from Neolithic cults is now rejected by scholars. (For example: See the book review by the archaeologist Osbert Crawford in Antiquity, Volume 71, Issues 271-274, 1999.)
See also the critical (English-language) book review of Marija Gimbutas's last book, The Living Goddesses (1999), by Lauren Talalay (then at University of Michigan), in Bryn Mawr Classical Review October 5, 1999. An extract: "Unfortunately, The Living Goddesses is a single-minded, essentializing, and largely unrigorous sweep through the mythology and folklore of prehistoric, historic, and modern Europe and the Mediterranean. As in much of Gimbutas's earlier work, the book raises intriguing questions but provides answers that are often unsatisfying and oversimplified, creating dichotomies that are more imagined than real. The weight of examples rather than carefully constructed arguments serves to buoy assertions. Like her other Goddess books, this one also has the feel of a museum display -- the "text as label" is more descriptive than analytic."

Alexander Marshack
It is claimed by some persons that Hamlet’s Mill gains support from the investigations of Alexander Marshack.
Alexander Marshack's theory of the existence of Paleolithic lunar calendars remains controversial and numerous objections have been raised against such. Early on, many anthropologists objected to the methods employed by Marshack’s application of the schematic notational apparatus he devised could extract a lunar cycle from almost any set of markings. As quick examples: Microscopic analysis of some of the same artifacts by other scholars (including Francesco d'Errico) yields different counts of marks, experimental replication of such artifacts suggests other reasons for the distinctions among marks, and there is reason to believe that all the marks were made at one time, rather than being a sort of tally system of time. (See: Megaliths, Myths and Men by Peter Brown (1976); "Paleolithic Lunar Calendars: A Case of Wishful Thinking?" by Francesco D'Errico (Current Anthropology, Volume 30, Number 1, 1989, Pages 117-118) and see also his reply to Alexander Marshack in Current Anthropology, Volume 30, Number 4, 1989, Pages 494-500; "Upper Paleolithic Notation Systems in Prehistoric Europe." by Simon Holdaway and Susan Johnston (Expedition, Volume 31, Number 1, 1989, Pages 3-11); "On the Impossibility of Close Reading: The Case of Alexander Marshack." by John Elkins (Current Anthropology, Volume 37, Number 2, 1996, Pages 185-201) and see also responses and replies on Pages 201-226; "Review of The Roots of Civilization." by Iain Davidson (American Anthropologist, New Series, Volume 95, Number 4, December, 1993, Pages 10271028); "Marking Time." by Daniel Rosenberg (Cabinet Magazine, Issue 28: Bones, Winter, 2007-2008. See also critical reviews of Alexander Marshack's publications by Andrée Rosenfeld (Antiquity, Volume XLV, 1971, Pages 317-319); and by Arden King (American Anthropologist, Volume 75, Number 6, 1973, Pages 1897-1900).) Francesco d’Errico made the point that Alexander Marshack’s classification was based on Marshack's own intuition and in reporting his results, Marshack had manipulated the number of marks and sequences in order to achieve an accumulation correlated to the motion of the sun or moon. It was after reading an article by Jean de Heinzelin (Jean de Heinzelin, "Ishango," Scientific American, Volume 206, June, 1962, Pages 109—110).) that Marshack (1918-2004) was prompted to begin to systematically comparing similarly marked bones. He eventually concluded that a very wide range of examples, including the Lartet bone and the Blanchard bone, adhered to a lunar pattern. Marshack did not actually claim that series of marks on certain bones were intended to be lunar calendar. He did, however, believe they were tallies related to lunar cycles. Marshack speculated that the notches could be read as examples of "lunar phrasing." Marshack never publicly released details of all the objects he thought were relation to marking lunar cycles - only the ones he thought provided the best proof of his ideas.
A stable lunar calendar is not easily enabled and is a complicated undertaking. The principal arguments against accepting Marshack's lunar calendar interpretation of scribed marks on certain bones relates to the issues of (1) where he decides a particular sequence of marks begins, and



(2) how he decides to count the marks. The critical investigation by Francesco D'Errico of Alexander Marshack's claim that lunar calendars were kept by the Azilian culture of France circa 12,000 years ago has not been supportive of the claim. The important experimental work carried out by Francesco D'Errico found that marks that appeared to be made over time by different tools on items that were claimed to be lunar calendars were, in all likelihood, made by the same tool and without time gaps. Further, no example has ever been given by Marshack, or his supporters, of any scheme of correct lunar month counts on any of the notched bones claimed to be lunar calendars. "Marshack's lunar-notation months vary from 27 to 33 days; the first and last quarters vary from 5 to 8 days and periods of Full Moon and New Moon from 1 to 4 days - plus an allowance of ± 1 day for errors in observation. From these very flexible parameters the lunar model used by Marshack can be made significant for any number or sequence of numbers between 1 and 16 and between 26 and 34. The difficulty in accepting Marshack's ideas is that for each example he has studied, each seems to require assumptions to be made about 'cloud-outs' or it requires other adjustments to account for inconsistencies. With good reason critics have claimed that his ideas are too glib and allow too much manoeuvring or arbitrary jiggling of numbers to suit circumstances. (Megaliths, Myths and Men by Peter Brown, (1976), Page 29.)" Also, the moon itself is never depicted on any of the bones claimed to comprise lunar calendars; but animals and other symbols sometimes are.
There is no indication that we can easily extend back to the Paleolithic Period for the number 7 or a 7-day week. The method of counting by 7-day weeks was not established until the Roman period. It has been frequently assumed that the four phases of the moon during the month led to a division of 4 weeks (seven and three-eighths days each). In reality the week and month belong to different systems of time reckoning. The 7-day week does not agree well with either a solar or lunar year. Both the day and week (as a numerical series of 7 days) are time systems which are independent of the moon. The month and the week are incompatible - their beginnings only occasionally coincide. All evidence indicates the cultic calendar of ancient Mesopotamia, and likewise the civil calendar, was tied to the phases of the moon, and not at all to a 7-day week. The evidence for a regularised lunar festival dates only to the end of the Sargonic period circa 2200 BCE and the beginning of the neo-Sumerian period circa 2100 BCE. It is still contentious whether the Babylonians possessed/instituted a 7-day week. The concept of the 7-day week is popularly believed to have originated in Mesopotamia/West Asia. It was also commonly believed by early Assyriologists. However, there is no clear evidence that the Mesopotamians (Babylonians) used 7-day weeks. There is no 7-day cycle in any astronomical or other natural phenomena. Relating the 7-day week to four phases of the moon is not obvious. Hence the concept of a 7-day lunar week is different to the issue of a lunar month. (The 7-day week is not actually a particularly good system for dividing the lunar month as it simply does not divide evenly into the actual duration of such. For this reason very few ancient peoples used a 7-day scheme.) The lunar month can at least be tracked by observing the cycles of the moon.
According to some early authorities the Babylonians had divided the year into 7-day weeks at least as early as the 15th-century BCE. Whilst the concept of 7 and 7 days was known in Mesopotamia it was not employed as a continuing weekly cycle to measure time (or even the interval between market days). The lunar month formed the basis for time reckoning. There are claims that the 7-day week cycle makes its earliest appearance in Babylonian documents dating to the 7th-century BCE but in this claimed system the 7-day weeks apparently did not succeed one another continuously. Part of the problem is it does not mesh with the 29 day and 30 day month counts. (See, for example: "New Moons and Sabbaths" by William Hallo, In: Essential Papers on Israel and the Ancient Near East edited by Frederick Greenspahn (1991).) It has been claimed by early Assyriologists that the Sumerian epic of 'Atra-Hassis' ('Story of the Flood'), preserved in Akkadian from the Old Babylonian period, has the earliest reference to what could be a 7-day week: "After the storm had swept over the country for seven days and seven nights." More likely it is common number symbolism. Simply talking of 7 days and 7 nights does not make a 7-day week. One non-lunar theory is simply the 7-day week originated as a planetary week based on the seven identified celestial bodies Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The Babylonians at least named the seven days of the week after these seven celestial bodies that they knew well. Also, the Babylonian sacred number seven was probably related to the seven "planets." The Babylonian 'Creation Epic' ('Enuma Elish') dating to the Kassite Period (perhaps circa 1600 BCE) or (more likely) Early Assyrian Period (perhaps circa 1100 BCE) has a description of lunar divisions that includes: "Thou shalt shine with horns to determine six days / And on the seventh with half a crown." Stephen Langdon writing in 1923 (The Babylonian Epic of Creation) over-confidently/erroneously states: "The major texts are all based upon a week of seven days, but K 13774 has a version based upon the five-day week." It needs to be understood that this statement of Langdon's was made without sufficient evidence. The Babylonian Creation Epic is full of references to the number 7. As examples: In its original form The Babylonian Creation Epic consisted of 7 tablets (i.e., 7 divisions with approximately 150 lines per tablet - 115 to 170 lines), the 7 winds (and one day was dedicated to each of the winds). However, the god Marduk is also described as stationing the 4 winds, but also arms himself with 7 destructive winds. In the early 7th-century BCE some Assyrian records indicated that work was prohibited on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days of the month. (See: Babylonian Menologies and the Semitic Calendars by Stephen Langdon (1935).) A syllabary from the Neo-Babylonian Period seems to provide evidence of the practice of subdivision of half-month periods into two 7-day periods. (See: Bulletin of the American School of Oriental Research, Number 93, February, 1944.)
The continuous weekly cycle of 7 days only became a standard unit for the measurement of time during the period of the Roman Empire. The 7day week was only consolidated with the ecclesiastical division of the year into weeks, each with 7 named days. (The 7-day week only became official in the Roman empire (and the Western World) with its establishment by an edict of the Roman Emperor Constantine (for Christian religious purposes) in 321 CE.) Gurshtein ignores this issue, or seems unaware there is an issue. The 7-day week (at least the continual 7-day week) is perhaps likely to have a double or triple origin in Greek, Jewish, and Mesopotamian ideas. The Jews at least since the Babylonian Exile (beginning circa 597 BCE) have had a 7-day week. The early Christians adopted the Jewish continuous 7-day week. The 7-day week originated within the Western Roman Empire - a reconciliation of the Christian 7-day week with the Roman calendar - and, with the consolidation of Christianity as the State religion, spread throughout the Western Roman Empire.
Calendars in Antiquity: Empires, States and Societies by Sasha Stern (2012) sets out reasons for believing that the change from flexible to fixed calendars was the way the 7-day week and zodiac-based horoscope were introduced. The change to fixed calendars occurred within the span 500 BCE to 300 CE. Stern maintains this was totally and purposefully based upon the unique, fixed calendar of Egypt, adopted by the (Zoroastrian) Achaemenid regime and passed on to the Hellenistic kingdoms and Rome’s Julian calendar.
Günter Martiny
Harald Reiche and others have referred to the pre WWII work of the German architect Günter Martiny and his claims for the astronomical orientation of Mesopotamian temples.
Martiny, Günter. (1932). Die Kultrichtung in Mesopotamien. Note: Basically the publication of the authors doctoral thesis (for the Technical College of Berlin). (Dissertation zur Erlangung der Würde eines Doktor-Ingenieurs der Technischen Hochschule zu Berlin vorgelegt am 15. Februar 1932.) In his doctoral thesis/this monograph he claimed to have determined some of the stars used by the ancient Mesopotamians to orient their temples. (After gaining his PhD Martiny only rarely used the title "Doctor.") The author offers (flimsy) evidence that Neo-Babylonian temples were oriented with reference to the constellations appropriate to their tutelary deities. See the extensive (German-language) reviews by Anon in Orientalistische Literaturzeitung, 1934, Number 4, Columns 218-232; by Paul Neugebauer and Albert Schott in Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und Verwandte Gebiete, Volume 42, 1934, Pages 198-217; and the entry in Astronomischer Jahresbericht, Volume 34, 1932, Page 12. (Martiny (Architectura, 1. Jahrgang, Heft 6, Page 236) mentions a review by Viktor Christian in Architectura, 1. Jahrgang, Heft 1 (Number 311 in



the Bibliography)) but I cannot presently access this journal. Also, see the review/critique of Die Kultrichtung in Mesopotamien by Franz Weissbach in OLZ, Band 37, 1934, Columns 218-232. In his doctoral dissertation (published in 1932 as Die Kultrichtung in Mesopotamien) Martiny described in detail the methods upon which he believed they based the orientation of their temples.
In his thesis Martiny tabulated the orientation of Assyrian temples for which the dates of foundation could be established (the oldest being circa 1800 BCE). Martiny maintained that Assyrian temples had been reconstructed (at least the foundations altered) during the period of their use; the orientations being varied according to the angle of the precession of the equinoxes. Günter Martiny believed that temple orientation to celestial phenomena began in Mesopotamia in the 3rd-millennium BCE and that by the 2nd-millennium BCE temples were oriented to specific stars, and the cult statue faced the direction of the rising star. According to Martiny the particular star would have heliacally risen on the Assyrian New Year. Günter Martiny believed he had found evidence that the orientation of a succession of Assyrian temples (of which the oldest date of foundation known is 1800 BCE) varies as a function of the angle of precession.(Martiny charted the changes of orientation of temples at Assur from 3000-500 BCE and believed he had identified a "steady" eastward movement in their orientations. His published chart indicates he examined the perceived "steady" eastward movement with changes in azimuths for β Andromedae.) According to Günter Martiny, Assyrian temples oriented to the southeast and Babylonian temples oriented to the northeast. In attempting to interpret Martiny's archaeological data Neugebauer and Schott initially proposed that Neo-Babylonian (i.e., Assyrian) temples were purposely directed towards the azimuth of the hour angle circle passing through the star alpha Virginis (Spica) and intersecting the horizon when the spring equinox is on the horizon. Both Paul Neugabauer (an astronomer) and Albert Schott (an Assyriologist) supported the temple-orientation theory of Günter Martiny. (As a result of his review of Dr. Günter Martiny's work on the survey of Assyrian sanctuaries, Professor P. V. Neugebauer, (Observatory at the Rechen-Institut in Berlin-Dahlem), believed he had discovered that all Assyrian Temples, from 2930 BCE to 603 BCE, whose foundation dates were recorded, were oriented at dawn on 1st Nisan to the point of intersection with the horizon of a great circle of the sphere, passing through the stars Eta Ursae Majoris (η Ursae Majoris (Ursa Major)) (Eta Ursae Majoris has the traditional names Alkaid (or Elkeid) and Benetnash (Benetnasch)), and Spica.) Neugebauer later discarded this explanation when he could not find evidence that the star alpha Virginis (Spica) had importance in Mesopotamian astronomy. The competent German amateur astronomer and historian of early astronomy Robert Böker disagreed with the alpha Virginis (Spica) explanation given by Neugebauer and Schott. Böker suggested an alternative hypothesis based on the azimuth of the descent of the star alpha Crucis and showed that it had better agreement with the reputed dates and axis azimuths of the temples. (In his short pamphlet Berechnungen zur vorgriechischen Astronomie (1948) Robert Böker showed that in antiquity there was no competent way to determine the equinoctial point with sufficient accuracy or to fix the azimuth of the intersection.) However, Neugebauer's changed explanation held that a clearly recognisable line is formed by the stars alpha Cassiopeiae, eta Cephei, beta Ursae Minoris, alpha Draconis, eta Ursae Majoris, and eta Virginis, and this line formed the meridian used in the centuries before and after circa 3000 BCE, as the basis for the orientation of Neo-Babylonian (Assyrian) temples. (The astronomical orientation, but not precessional re-alignment, of Mesopotamian temples was considered by some 19th-century excavators and briefly considered in Stonehenge and Other British Stone Monuments Astronomically Considered by Norman Lockyer (1906, Chapter XXIX A Short History of Astronomy).)
The thesis of Martiny is based on figures from Warka that were later seriously questioned. (Babylonian and Assyrian 'temple sites' included in his study were Uruk (Southern Iraq), Tell El-'Obēd (Tell el-'Ubaid) ) (Southern Iraq), Tepe Gawra (Northwest Iraq), and Assur (on the upper Tigris River in Iraq). One of the methodological issues with the figures produced by Martiny is that he charted the orientation of the Gimilsin Temple and the Palace Chapel according to True Magnetic North rather than True North and he made adjustments accordingly. Also, he gave no explanatory information regarding the data on the orientation of the other temples included in his orientation chart. Further, the "orientation chart," whilst showing the eastward movement of the Assur temples and β Andromedae, is somewhat vague. (There is no persuasive evidence that Mesopotamian temples, of any period, were systematically aligned to any directions.) Circa 1986 Asger Aaboe advised that Martiny's claims were purely hypothetical and that still today nothing is known about if and how the ancient Mesopotamians used astronomy to orient their temples. (See: Revue d'assyriologie et d'archéologie oriental, Tomes 80-81, 1986, Page 39.) The topic of temple orientation has never gained popularity in Assyriology. Martiny's ideas on temple orientation are briefly noted by the assyriologist William Hallo in his book Origins: The Ancient Near Eastern Background of Some Modern Western Institutions (1996, Page 84).
Part 6: The Ten Key Claims: A Critique
The authors of Hamlet's Mill try to rest great/significant claims on subjective bits of speculative evidence.
(1) The claim for an archaic (astronomical) science
Diffusionists believed that cultural development was not unilineal (i.e., all aspects of a culture moved in a 'single line' from the most primitive to the most sophisticated). Diffusionists held that a culture with a simple technology might have a highly sophisticated religious system (or astronomical system).
In Hamlet's Mill Giorgio de Santillana claims that a "great worldwide archaic construction" of astronomical knowledge was in existence long before the Greeks were an established civilization, and that remnants of this astronomical knowledge survive in misunderstood myths and fairy tales. (Old mythological lore is claimed to be riddled with coded references to precession.) Basically, Hamlet's Mill argues for a pre-literate world civilisation. It shared an international pre-literate code language of numbers, motions, and measures. The authors of Hamlet's Mill not only believed that myths are highly complex (but coherent) knowledge systems embedding astronomical information but also that myths (i.e., their content/code) remained astonishingly stable in a pre-literate world for over several millennia. However, the coherence the authors argue exist behind diverse myths is not evident in their arguments. According to de Santillana the Pythagorean tradition was a expression of this ancient "gnosis," repeated in the language of archaic myth, and from this source we have much of the foundation of modern civilization (including the beginnings of mathematics and the doctrine that the world is formed according to number). According to de Santillana Plato could "speak the language of archaic myth" and built the first modern philosophy on this foundation. De Santillana believed that behind Plato's myths was his knowledge of the 'ancient system' and that Plato used this language in his allegories - "without divulging their precise meaning: whoever was entitled to the knowledge of the proper terminology would understand him." Needless to say, this is all simply de Santillana's speculations. De Santillana has also pointed out that Plato and his school moved away from the more scientific attitude of the earlier Ionian scientists and replaced their physics by an astro-theological cosmos which discouraged experimenting.
In Hamlet's Mill, de Santillana and von Dechend adhere to the same fallacy which effectively undermined Panbabylonism - namely, an uncritical belief in the existence of a sophisticated knowledge of astronomy in antiquity. Mèlanges de l'Université Saint-Joseph, Volume 61, 2008, Page 26: "This group [of Panbabylonists], among them [Hugo] Winckler, [Alfred] Jeremias, [Peter] Jensen, and [Ernest] Weidner, following the idea first promulgated by the amateur comparative mythographer [Eduard] Stucken, claimed that the source of a tendency to personify and allegorize the movements of the heavenly bodies as mythic projections of the activities of deities was to be found in Mesopotamia, from where the phenomenon diffused throughout the ancient world as astral mythology and astral religions." According to Panbabylonism Babylonian religion was at first purely astral in character. (The problem is that broad statements involving Mesopotamia ignore that at that early period and onwards Mesopotamia



was never a single united and homogeneous culture/kingdom. It was divided into a number of small independent kingdoms (city states) formed by each principal city.) Von Dechend, the main force behind Hamlet's Mill, held many similar ideas to the Panbabylonists, made frequent reference to their literature, but avoided making any direct reference to Panbabylonism.
Exactly which Neolithic peoples had this sophisticated astronomical knowledge is not explained nor is the manner of its world-wide diffusion. Circa 5000 BCE humankind must have been few in number, scattered, and nomadic. Also, peoples living in the American continent have been (or mostly been) separated physically from the Eurasian continent for at least 10,000 years.
Rather curiously, the conjectured ancient astronomers - though able to deal with precession - did not recognise the proper motions of stars.
Up until the medieval period the Babylonians remained the most competent astronomers. "Astronomy in Mesopotamia is divided historically into a primarily schematic astronomy in the late second and early first millennia B.C., and a scientific, mathematical astronomy in the Seleucid period. The common idea that astronomy in Mesopotamia evolved from an observational to a purely computational science is not supported by extant textual sources. It remains characteristic for Babylonian astronomy that, from the earliest examples, astronomical texts deal with numerical schemata." ("Stellar Distances in Early Babylonian Astronomy: A New Perspective on the Hilprecht Text (HS 229)." by Francesca RochbergHalton (Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Volume 42, Number 3, July 1983, Pages 209-217).) From the earliest extant astronomical material from the 2nd-millennium BCE the Babylonians were engaged with schematic computational schemes for predicting phenomena, without recourse to observation.
Excerpt from book r4eview by William Dibble in Dialogue, Volume 11, 1978, Page(s) 85-87.
Absence of sophisticated Sumerian astronomy
"The scribes of the Old Babylonian period were very zealous copyists and went to great lengths to preserve the literature that came down to them from the past, especially the archives of the Third Dynasty at Ur [the Neo-Sumerian Empire, 22nd to 21st century BCE]. There were as well, however, many marvellous and original works put together by these Akkadian scribes themselves." ("Syro-Mesopotamia: The Old Babylonian Period" by Ronald Veenker. In: Mesopotamia and the Bible edited by Mark Chavalas and K. Younger Junior. (2002; Pages 149-167, Page 163). No Sumerian planetary astronomy is evident.
The pole of the ecliptic
In Hamlet's Mill, de Santillana and von Dechend, in keeping with their use of dated "authorities" rely on Bouche-Leclerq 1899) and Kircher (1653) for their claim that the Mesopotamians were aware of the pole of the ecliptic and that it was, unlike the pole of the equator, stable over time. "Antiquity was not likely to grasp this, since dynamics came into this world only with Galileo. Hipparchus and Ptolemy could not understand the mechanism. They could only describe the motion. We must try to see through their eyes, and think only in terms of kinematics. Over a period of a thousand years ancient observers could discern in the secular shifting of the Great Gyroscope (it is here in fact that the word "secular" now used in mechanics originates) a motion through about ten degrees. Once attuned to the secular motion, they were able to detect, in the daily whirring of heaven around the pole, in its yearly turning in the round of the seasons, in the excruciatingly slow motion of the pole over the years, a point which seemed intrinsically more stable than the pole itself. It was the pole of the ecliptic [footnote 11. See A. Bouche-Leclerq, L'Astrologie Grecque (1899), p. 122: "On sait que le pole par excellence etait pour les Chaldeens le pole de l'ecliptique, lequel est dans la constellation du Dragon." Cf. also A. Kircher, Oedipus Aegyptiacus (1653), vol. 2, pt. 2, p. 205: "Ponebant Aegyptii non Aequatorem, sed Zodiacum basis loco; ita ut centrum hemispherii utriusque non polum Mundi, sed polum Zodiaci referret."], often referred to as the Open Hole in Heaven because in that region there is no star to mark it. The symmetries of the machine took shape in their minds. And truly it was the time machine, as Plato understands it, the "moving image of eternity." The "mighty marching and the golden burning," cycle upon cycle, even down to shifts barely perceptible over the centuries, were the Generations of Time itself, the cyclical symbol of everlastingness: for, as Aristotle says, what is eternal is circular, and what is circular is eternal.” (Hamlet's Mill (1969, Pages 142-143).)
According to Hamlet's Mill the ecliptic south pole was thought to be marked by the star Canopus.
(2) The claim for Neolithic discovery of precession
Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend, argue that Neolithic cultures had knowledge of the precessional celestial cycle and had incorporated it into most of their earliest myths. Nothing in their book constitutes proof that a Neolithic culture noticed precession or that the vernal equinox was once in the Milky Way.
A statement to the effect "The argument that the [precessional] movement of the stars was not noticed before Hipparchus is highly dubious." achieves nothing. What is required is evidence for the belief that it was - not rhetoric. There is no solid evidence of early knowledge of precession. What we get is statements like: "My opinion is that any early culture that observed the stars over a long period and attached religious/festival observations to their rising and setting would have become anxious when those risings and settings altered in relation to the horizon or solar cycle, even if they had no concept of precession."
Hamlet's Mill sets out that precession was the single greatest preoccupation of all ancient cultures. However, it appears there was no 'plain language' discussion of it. (Exactly why allegedly sophisticated precessional knowledge should be clad in the family narrative of Hamlet is puzzling.) Also, the date of its supposed early discovery is left vague in Hamlet's Mill. The authors even imply that it was perhaps discovered earlier than the Neolithic Period. Their brief remarks on the issue appear on page 340 of Hamlet's Mill (1969). The 4000 BCE date is given importance – and identified as the latest possible date for the realization of precession - by the authors because it was, in their view, the ending of the Golden Age (and they claim that this gave rise to the various flood myths). They assert their belief that the actual date for the discovery of precession was much earlier, perhaps by many millennia. "Its beginning has already been placed in the Neolithic, without setting limits in the past, let prehistoric archaeologists decide. (Hamlet's Mill, Page 340)." The authors also claim in footnote 4 on the same page: "These people could compute backward as well as forward." However, the authors set out sufficiently enough that when the whole scheme started (Page 59): "Time Zero" was circa 5000 BCE and relates to the junction of the Galaxy and (the plane of the) ecliptic when the vernal equinoctial sun was in (and leaving) Gemini the Twins. Also, the area of the sky was occupied by both the Milky Way and the bright stars of the belt of Orion.
The absurd nature of of Hamlet's Mill is aptly demonstrated on page 340 (1st edition). The date of 4000 BCE is offered with a reference to Willy Hartner's speculative 1965 article, "The Earliest History of the Constellations in the Near East and the Motif of the Lion-Bull Combat" (Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Volume 24, Number 1/2, January-April, 1965, Pages 1-16, and Plates 1-XVI). However, this article is seriously flawed. Also, it is claimed that an unknown people at this time, situated somewhere in the Near East (but exactly where is not known), could compute backward as well as forward. The assertions comprise belief without evidence. There is no quality evidence to support such beliefs.



"... this was the time when the time when the crossroads of Ecliptic and Equator was also the crossroads of Equator and Milky Way, at the points marked by lambda/mu and mu/eta of Gemini. If we try to bring back the long-lost picture to our imagination, it must have been quite an impressive spectacle, when (latitude ± 'Babylon' at the equinoxes before sunrise, the Milky Way stood right above your head like an arch from East to West, marking the path of the Sun - or, at the solstices, lay coiled around the horizon like a huge serpent ...." (Introduction to Cosmology (1961, Page 72)). "It is a fact that the Sun of March 21 did leave the path of the Milky Way, after all, sometime before 5000 B.C." (Introduction to Cosmology (1961, Page 74)).
Excursus: In ancient times people noticed the fixed position of the Milky Way among the constellations. The Milky Way was believed to separate (and connect) parts of the hemisphere of heaven).
Thomas McEvilley, a classical philologist and a disciple of Hamlet's Mill, following the speculations of its authors, would have us believe the discovery of precession in the Neolithic Period was not too difficult. It does not require having a grandfather who has a tree and passes down stories about his lifetime observation of the night sky. For McEvilley (The Shape of Ancient Thought (2002), Neolithic astronomers were aware of the slippage along the ecliptic of the equinoctial sunrise. This was the 'trigger' for research leading to the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes. Knowledge of the cycle of precession became part of their knowledge of invariances in nature that were their 'pivot points' to work from in their constructions of reality. McEvilley also sets out that "ancient traditions" involved both knowledge and channels of communication that were kept rigorously secret. Implied in this is the assumption that between the supposed consolidation of knowledge of precession in the Neolithic Period by circa 4000 BCE, and its discovery by Hipparchus of Rhodes (flourished 2nd-century BCE), it was never rediscovered by persons not heirs to the supposed world-wide system of 'secret knowledge' known only to a world-wide close/restricted intellectual elite. Also, it was apparently separated from, or kept from, persons involved in calendar construction; regardless that accurate calendar construction was one of the most important issues in the ancient world. McEvillery does, however, give an account of McClain's acoustic theory of the basis of mythology (The Shape of Ancient Thought (2002, Pages 81-82)) and acknowledge that sexagesimal/precessional numbers can be fitted to acoustical arithmetic as to precessional arithmetic. He views McClain's argument as, in effect, an adaptation of the Hamlet's Mill argument to another context. More correctly McClain likely has the correct context.
The author's of Hamlet's Mill provide an example of their uncritical use of material: "Ernst Dittrich, for instance, remarked that one should not expect much astronomical knowledge from Mesopotamians around 2000 B.C. "Probably they knew only superficially the geometry of the motions of sun and moon. Thus, if we examine the simple, easily observable motions by means of which one could work out chronological determinants with very little mathematical knowledge, we find only the Precession. ... [Footnote] 6 "Gibt es astronomische Fixpunkte in der ältesten babylonischen Chronologie?" OLZ 15 (1912), col. 104." (Hamlet's Mill, Pages 66-67). The authors of Hamlet's Mill do not identify who Dittrich was. Jane Sellers (The Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt, Page 187), who obvious uses the quote material (slightly modified) from Hamlet's Mill, identifies him as a "German astronomer." This is likely a guess. I cannot identify either an astronomer or assyriologist named Ernst Dittrich. I can identify a Ernst Dittrich (1868-1948) who is an Austrian architect. () Regarding Ernst Dittrich's precession articles in Orientalistische Literaturzeitung (OLZ). Dittrich wrote OLZ, Number 7, 1909, Column 292; then OLZ, Number 3, 1910, Column 103. Kugler replied in OLZ, Number 6, 1910, Column 277 to Dittrich's 1910 article. Dittrich then replied to Kugler in OLZ, Number 1, 1911, Columns 14-18. It appears Kugler did not reply. (The sympathy of the early editors of OLZ for Panbabylonism is clear in OLZ, Number 12, 1909, Columns 521-527.).
Two addition difficulties for the claim in Hamlet's Mill that the 'real' meaning of ancient myths was known only to the intellectual elite, or priesthood, of prehistoric human society are raised by Roy Willis and Patrick Curry in their book, Astrology, Science and Culture (2004, Pages 4546): "There are two principal objections to this one-dimensional 'reading' of mythical language. The first is that all we know of hunter-gathering peoples from first-hand modern studies and ancient story suggests that out prehistoric ancestors lived in nomadic, socially unstratified and normatively egalitarian groups until the later stages of the Neolithic and the so-called Bronze Age. In these social circumstances, it would be surprising to find a closed elite possessing 'secret' knowledge, as posited by the authors of Hamlet's Mill. [Also, small population groups and early death rates (as well as continual group movement) would make the perpetuation and improvement of astronomical and other knowledge difficult. It would be difficult to pass along new ideas and innovations when when life passed very quickly with people rarely living past 30-35 years. The death of people during the dangerous work of big animal hunts likely took their toll of clan genius's.] The second objection to their theory is provided by the monumental work of Lévī-Strauss and his exhaustive demonstration of the complex transformations of mythical narrative across cultures and continents, together with the work of his disciples and emulators in Africa and Asia. To suppose that this kaleidoscopic material conveys a stable, precise mapping of celestial events that could be seen as congruent with the ordered, mechanical universe of Newtonian astronomy seems less than plausible." There is little evidence of developed social stratification in most Neolithic societies. Most Neolithic societies were relatively simple and egalitarian. During most of the Neolithic people lived in small tribes/clans of 150–2000 members that were composed of multiple bands or lineages. Social stratification is largely associated with the later Bronze Age.
The proponents of ancient (pre-Hipparchan/Neolithic) knowledge of precession are basically reflecting the ideas of Panbabylonism. No proof has been found for knowledge of precession antedating Hipparchus. No firm proof has been found for Western constellations existing prior to circa 2000 BCE. Also, the zodiac originated in Babylonia as late as circa 5th-century BCE.
In his book Psychanodia (Volume 1, 1983) the Romanian scholar Ioan Culianu (1950-1991) discusses a late Babylonian text that mentions the Pleiades not rising on time and therefore being 'evil.' However, this issue is within the framework of omenology. In his book Babylonian Star-Lore (2007) Gavin White attributes a working knowledge of precession and its long-term effects on celestial coordinates to Babylonian astrologers of the late 3rd-millennium BCE. His speculation is accompanied by the mix of words, including: "I believe," "strongly supports," "supports the idea," "no doubt," "implies," "implied," "was necessary," and "necessitated." No evidence or no compelling evidence is offered. The way the "Babylonian" calendar operated there is no reason to suppose that a calendar error would become would become really conspicuous until after say 2000 years. This brings us down to the late Hellenistic period.
Evidence that may show that an ancient culture knew of the displacement of a certain star or stars cannot be cited as evidence that they knew about the phenomenon of precession. Precise knowledge of the effect of precession on the position of various stars over long periods of time is a different matter to the observation that certain stars may no longer rise and set where they once did. The latter observation is likely to be made in any society which might have observed particular stars from fixed monuments over a long period of time, but does not necessarily suggest any awareness of precession. The 2 concepts should not be confused in discussion. There is no identified tradition of long-term seasonal displacement of familiar stars used as markers.
The discovery of precession
According to von Dechend a few ancient men discovered precession. (And out of this discovery there very quickly became established a worldwide system of precessional mythology.



Von Dechend believed that coded within mythology was the explanation of how precession was discovered and the date! See: Introduction to Cosmology: A Preliminary Reconnaissance (1961, Page 60): "All this tells us the story of how the Precession was discovered, and it even sets a date. It was some time after the Equinoctial Sun had moved from Geminus into Taurus, say close to 4000 B.C. It presupposes by that time already a fairly refined understanding of heavenly motions comparable to that of classic Greece. The technique of observation, on the other hand, was relatively simple and needed no complex instruments, if there was enough intentness of mind. It was based on the heliacal rising of stars, which remained a fundamental feature in Babylonian astronomy. If you came to realise that a certain star, which was wont to rise just before the Equinoctial Sun, was no longer visible on the day, it was clear that the machine of heaven had shifted. If that star was the last one of a given Zodiac figure, it meant that the Equinox was moving into a new figure. The equinoctial point had nudged and nuzzled its way forward, in the same way as a car with automatic gearshift will nuzzle its way forward unless we put it in neutral -- and there was no way of putting the equinox in neutral."
The alleged discovery circa 4000 BCE of precession and the quick development of a successful understanding of uniform precessional motion is highly unlikely.
Neither in Hamlet's Mill nor in her MIT seminar notes does von Dechend even remotely identify a specific culture/people as the discovers of precession and the astronomical framework that developed. Somewhere in the ancient Near East is as close as we get. In reply to the proposal posted on Hastro-L that the approach of the authors of Hamlet's Mill is not new; that it is the "Secret Doctrine" approach ("myth contains deliberately coded information"), the German academic Franz Krojer contributed the interesting reply (Hastro-L, January 27, 2003): "I had and have also much difficulties with this book. I contacted therefore H. v. Dechend two years ago, before her death, and some of that correspondence will be in my book about (against) the medieval "fictious" (sic) time Illig's (but only in German). I can't follow the "Secret Doctrine" connected with v. Dechend. As far as I understand v. Dechend, the myths do not contain "deliberated (sic) encoded information", but they were simply the "open" scientific language (at least for the priests) to express scientific insights at that time. [Mythology, whether or not the "open" lingua franca of ancient priests and scholars in the Near East, presents problems. Simply, how did this particular cultural/regional lingua franca become known and used world-wide?] (I don't know, if this differentiation is too scholastic, but I see here two standpoints.) Two questions about the English edition of Hamlet's Mill (I have only the German edition): 1. At the German cover of "Die Mühle des Hamlet" is printed, that the Sumerians had a "complete knowledge" ("vollstaendige Kenntnis") of the precession of the equinox. The answer of H. v. Dechend to me was, that she never claimed such an "fatal fooling" ("fataler Unfug") [better sense, "fatal mischief"]. Is such a "fooling" also printed at the cover of the English editon? (sic) 2. In the German edition, a "Lysias" is sometimes mentioned (from the letter, which was also well known by Copernicus). But it should be "Lysis" not "Lysias". Is this lapse also in the English edition?" The particular response by von Dechend in declining to make any specific identification not only identifies a lack of "progress" but also illustrates the vague foundations of Hamlet's Mill. My comment regarding an ""open" scientific language" is that this does not ensure a stable "transmission package" of information.
More details are given by Franz Krojer in his book Die Präzision der Präzession (2003, in the chapter "Der Riss zwischen den Kulturen" (Page 229)). The cover of the 2nd-edition of the German edition of Hamlet's Mill has a statement claiming that circa 6000 years ago the Sumerians possessed a complete knowledge of the precession of the equinoxes, which is only explainable in terms of an existing tradition of systematic observation over thousands of years and also an oral tradition for transmission of the information. It appears that von Dechend was unaware of this and found it somewhat devastating to learn of it. She denied having ever made such a mischievous claim. She also explained that there were difficulties with exactness and likelihood of errors and she had not wanted to elaborate on such issues. It seems obvious the publisher - without understanding what was set out in the book - had invented the details and included them on the book's cover.
Neolithic mathematics and astronomers?
Proposing that there were persistent and accurate observers - at least by the Neolithic period - is one thing. Proposing that they were also adept at calculations - and exact calculations at that - is quite another matter. There is no compelling evidence that elaborate arithmetical calculations and inferential conclusions were made by so-called 'Neolithic astronomers.' It is not surely indicated that any astronomical exploits of Neolithic societies included a numerate science. However, possible examples of an interest in precision astronomy and the ability for sophisticated calculations is suggested by the alignment of passages at the Boyne Valley Neolithic sites of Newgrange and Knowth. That an illiterate society can develop accurate methods of astronomical measurement is indicated by the ancient Britons who found how to measure lunar inclination. (However, there is a constant danger of error being involved when projecting the experience of modern mathematics and technology onto the artefacts of what must be considered an alien culture.) Regardless, we only have solid evidence that Hipparchus made the earliest calculations of precession in about 160 BCE. Awareness of the effects of precession is not the same as technically understanding precession (or of accurately measuring the rate of precession). It is perhaps most likely that prehistoric people would be focused on what served them best - the changes in climate over the seasons. Some kind of system for determining key times in the agricultural cycle would have been very important to the early farmers of the ancient Near East. However, calendars were not a prerequisite for the development of agriculture. In the period before the development of writing early farmers may have simply depended on knowledge of the seasons from changing seasonal temperatures, changes in vegetation, animal births, the flight of birds, onset of rains, or the flooding of rivers. Because of possible yearly variations in the weather any reliance on precise calendrical dates would not allow adequate adjustment appropriate to producing good harvests. However, focusing entirely on utilitarian needs as a determinant could be misleading.
(3) The claim for precession in the Erra-epic
Understanding the narrative
The so-called Erra-epos (Isum and Erra) myth, is known from Neo-Assyrian times only. It is a myth connected with the Netherworld. The centre of the narrative is the fury of Erra, the god of war and pestilence, against the human beings who disturb the gods with their noise. The Erra Epic tells how Erra seized control of the cosmos by persuading the chief god, Marduk, to step down temporarily from power. Erra, motivated by his vizier Isum, arranges that Marduk, the king of the gods and Lord of Babylon, leaves his throne and visits the fire god Girra for the procedure of cleaning his adornments. During the absence of Marduk from his throne Erra takes over the world realm and changes all the rules. With his seven warriors, the Sebitti, Erra then inaugurates a period of destruction and bloodshed throughout Mesopotamia until he is finally pacified by his comrade, Ishum, god of fire. Erra destroys the human race, the world order, and the basis of civilization, that is: Babylon, the centre of the world. Marduk is forced to descend to the Netherworld. Finally, Erra is able to be calmed by his vizier, and Marduk resumes his reign, which ensures the reinstalment of order. This myth contains a description of the fear of the Netherworld of one of the gods when he is divested of his control over world order. The scope of this text is not an explanation of the afterlife, but rather a warning to the audience to leave the existing order unchanged and to be obedient and support the legal government.
Interpreting the narrative



The authors of Hamlet's Mill hold that the clearest statement of precession exists in the Erra-Epic (also known as the Erra and Ishum Epic). (See: Hamlet's Mill by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend (1969) Pages 325.) The authors write: "... it is necessary to leave Era's somber prophecy unfulfilled, relating as it does to a coming world age: "Open the way, I will take the road, The days are ended, the fixed time is past." But with it comes the clearest statement ever uttered by men or gods concerning the Precession. Says Marduk: When I stood up from my seat and let the flood break in, then the judgement of Earth and Heaven went out of joint ... The gods, which trembled, the stars of heaven - their position changed, and I did not bring them back." Amazingly, the authors fail to engage in any developed discussion, scholarly or otherwise, of this section of the text. The source of the "Marduk quote" in Hamlet's Mill is the late version of the Erra-Epic, generally believed by scholars to have been written circa the eighth-century BCE, and is likely derived from (the German-language) book Das Era-Epos by Felix Gössmann (1956). (The author of the Erra-Epic, Kabti-ilani-Marduk of the Dabibi-family, claimed that the work was revealed to him in a dream.) Which author of Hamlet's Mill made the English-language translation is not known. Unfortunately Gössmann's edition of the Erra-Epic has problems due to the fact he did not have access to all suitable material.
In the Erra-Epic there is a scenario involving disorder affecting the earth and heavens when Marduk temporarily leaves his throne. The context is an apocalyptic type scenario similar to the Biblical book Apocalypse of John (i.e., Book of Revelation). (See the discussion in Cosmos, Chaos and the World to Come by Norman Cohn (1993). Erra is an Akkadian warrior god. The result of Erra's assault is that the world is plunged into darkness and as a result Marduk is displaced from his throne and forced to descend to the underworld. Erra temporarily seizes control of Babylon from Marduk during the latter's temporary absence. As the phenomena of precession is completely unconnected with any occurrence of celestial darkness this type of imagery can hardly be descriptive of precession. The theme of the chosen imagery of the Erra-Epic is believed to refer to a disastrous military event that occurred to the city of Babylon in the "dark age" at the beginning of the first millennium BCE. The central theme of the poem is concerned with the assault by Erra on the kingdom of Marduk. Babylon was the residence of the god Marduk and the centre of the universe. The disaster was interpreted in religious terms as the temporary replacement of Marduk by Erra. It is possible the poem is descriptive of a raid by the semi-nomadic Sutian people on the city of Babylon. The Sutians (who lived along the Euphrates River) periodically raided Mesopotamian cities. It has also been proposed that the epic was composed following the recovery of the statue of Marduk from Susa by Nebuchadnezzar 1 after its removal by the Elamite king Kutir-Nahhunte. (Statue-napping was a significant issue in ancient Mesopotamia.) This event is dated to the 12th-century BCE. Circa 1160 BCE King Kutir-Nahhunte invaded Mesopotamia and took the city of Babylon. Included amongst the items he brought back from Babylon was the Code of Hammurabi/Hammurapi. Circa 1120 BCE King Nebuchadnezzar 1 conquered Elam.
Erra is the god of war and pestilence (and ultimately fire). For an authoritative discussion that the Erra poem (a narrative poem) is not myth; it is mythologised history, see the paper "The Epic of Gilgamesh: Thoughts on Genre and Meaning." by the assyriologist Andrew George. The actual overall point being made by the story is the equilibrium of the physical and moral world (both equally divine appointments) depend on the presence of the god Marduk. For a discussion of some content of the epic of Erra and Išum (its theme of alternating destruction through flood and fire) as a possible mythological antecedent to the later astronomical theory of the 'Great Year' see: "A Possible Babylonian Precursor to the Theory of ecyprōsis." by Marinus van der Sluijs (Culture and Cosmos, Volume 9, Number 2, Autumn/Winter, 2005, Pages 1-19).
It is not directly indicated that the Babylonians recognised that star rise azimuths (i.e., movement along the horizon) and heliacal times/dates of rising and setting changed through time. If they did, which one would suppose they did, they did not leave any precise records of calculations involving such observations.
It is worth noting that the idea is expressed in Enuma Elish that Marduk threatens to "... alter the ways of the gods, and ... change [their paths]" (Tablet VI, Line 9). In Tablet VII, Lines 110-111 it is said of Marduk: "For the stars of heaven he upheld the paths, He shepherded all the gods like sheep!" (See: King, The Seven Tablets of Creation (1902, Volume 1) and also Kugler, Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel, Volume I (1907), Page 7.) I am surprised that nobody has interpreted this as 'evidence' of precession.
Jeffrey Cooley's recent explanation
Cooley, Jeffrey. (2008). ""I Want to Dim the Brilliance of Šulpae!" Mesopotamian Celestial Divination and the Poem of "Erra and Išum"." (Iraq, Volume 70, Pages 179-188). Note: Precession is not described. "A long time ago I was angry, I rose from my throne and brought on the Flood. When I rose from my throne, the judgment of Ki-tim up-ta-at-tir heaven and earth disintegrated. The heavens quaked such that the stars of heaven, their station(s) changed and I did not return them to their place(s)." Marduk's former abdication changed the normal, ideal positions of the stars. The celestial situation portended an earthly disaster which resulted in agricultural and environmental collapse (I 135-137). In the astronomical literature, the term manzazu "station" refers to a celestial body's position in the sky. In Enuma Elis V, the manzazu are described as the ideal celestial locations of the gods established for them at creation by Marduk: "He created stations for the great gods, The stars, their counterparts, he set in place (as) constellations."
(4) The 'Great Year'
The Babylonians and the Greeks conceived the doctrine of a 'Great Year;' the doctrine of recurrent cosmic conflagrations. It was the time after which the planets would realign themselves in identical positions in the sky. Basically it is linked to a great cycle involving the sun, moon, planets, stars and seasons returning to their original arrangement i.e., to the same sign they originally set out from. This was the period of the cosmos from creation to destruction. The whole doctrine of 'cosmic recurrence' is of Babylonian origin. There were no early Sumerian/Akkadian beliefs in a 'Great Year.' As the Babylonians were not familiar with precession the 'Great Year' concept is not anchored in precession. The 'Great Year' of the Classical world arose from the mythical conception of a cosmic periodicity the origin of which is ultimately traceable to Babylonia. The Babylonians developed the notion of a repetitive cosmic 'Great Year;' a that belief immense cycles of time culminated in huge catastrophes and recurrence of creation. Berossos the Babylonian (residing on the Greek island of Cos) wrote of a 'cosmic year' of 432,000 years. Identifying Babylonian sources before Berossos is problematic. Despite the common opinion that the idea of a 'Great Year' originated in Babylonian circles, there is no clear and unambiguous evidence of a Babylonian expectation of an end of the world in any form before Berossus. However, the epic of Erra and Išum, when carefully evaluated, seems to provide this. It seems indicated that the concept of the 'Great Year' originated in late Babylonian beliefs concerning planetary conjunctions. Berossos writes the work of creating the world carried within its structure repetitively recurring celestial cycles of destruction and recurrence. (Perpetual celestial cycles involving immense cycles of time and recurrent catastrophes involving huge floods and conflagrations.) The Babylonian 'Great Year' was about all the planets gathering within one particular zodiacal sign. (More the simultaneous, periodic return of all the planets to the same point of the zodiac.) There were later variations in what was meant by the 'Great Year' but basically it is linked to a great cycle involving the sun, moon, planets, stars, and seasons returning to their original arrangement i.e., to the same sign they originally set out from when created. One cycle of a 'Great Year' would last until the planets aligned in their original position or zodiac sign in the cosmos. The idea of a 'Great Year' encompassed the doctrine of a Flood and Ekpyrosis. Aristotle stated that in the winter of this year a flood (kataklysmos) takes place, in the summer a conflagration (destruction by fire) (ekpyrosis). The Stoics were certainly interested in the 'Great Year' concept. It is thought that the Babylonian 'Great Year' was adopted by the Stoics. The Greek formulation of the 'Great Year' involved recurrent cataclysms of flood and fire. "The early Stoic version of the eternal recurrence is that a great conflagration (ekpurôsis)



marks a stage in the cycle of the reconstitution of the cosmos (apokatastasis). One cycle, a Great Year (SVF, 2.599), would last until the planets align in their original position or zodiac sign in the cosmos (SVF, 2.625). Each age would end in Fire, the purest of elements and the irreducible cosmic substance, and would be followed by a restoration of all things. ("Hellenistic Astrology." by Marilynn Lawrence (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy))" (Note: SVF = Stoicorum veterum fragmenta, ed. J. von Arnim (Leipzig: Teubner, 1903.) In the Classical world it was Plato (writing before Berossos' account) who first made a clear statement of the 'Great Year' which he called the 'Perfect Year.' The Platonic Year in Timaeus is linked to "powerful" conjunctions and not to the precession of the equinoxes and solstices. Plato defined the 'Perfect Year' as a period at the end of which the fixed stars and planets return to the point from which they started their revolution. Aristotle called the same period the 'Greatest Year.' When I see 36,000 in Mesopotamian records my spontaneous association is with the 'Great Year' of planetary conjunctions - which was not estimated with reference to precession. Plato's 36,000 year length is linked to the idea of powerful conjunctions and is not linked to the idea of precession (or to the solstices and equinoxes). In later Greek and Latin texts this cosmic period is called the 'Great Year.' Precession is not necessarily involved. The 'Great Year' concept is not anchored in precession. The 'Great Year' and the 'precessional year' are entirely different in concept but get mixed. Because of this mix there were variations in what was meant by the 'Great Year.' That some Greeks after Hipparchus must have, at times, become confused and identified/made a connection between a 'Great Year' and a 'precessional year' is a different issue. In some of the older astro-mythology books it is common to see the cycle of precession referred to as the 'Great Year' or 'Platonic Year' (and also as the 'precessional year of Hipparchus'). Amongst the Greeks the estimated length of the 'Great Year' varied. The duration of the 'Great Year' was not reliant on exact astronomy - ideas of the time of a 'Great Year' varied between very long cycles and (in later Greek and Latin writers) very short cycles. Cicero estimated 11,460 year for the Great Year whilst Macrobius estimated 15,000 years for the 'Great Year.' Heraclitus appears to have estimated 10,800 years for the 'Great Year.' Plato's later figure of 36,000 years for the 'Perfect Year' was later identified with the 'Great Year.' Oenopidus and later Philolaus both had estimates of 59 years for the 'Great Year.' It appears Democritus estimated 77 years for the 'Great Year.'
See also: The Thousands of Abū Ma'shar (1968) by David Pingree. The book is a detailed study of the topic of the East-Iranian astrologer Abū Ma'shar's version of the idea of world periods initiated and terminated by cataclysms - cyclically recurrent floods and similar catastrophes, and determined astronomically by a conjunction of all planets at the zero point of the ecliptic. A (English-language) book review, "The Thousands of Abū Ma'shar," by Willy Hartner, in which he endorses Hamlet's Mill, is published in The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, (New Series), Volume 104, Issue 1, January, Pages 63-65.
The reliable reference on the 'Great Year' is Annus Platonicus: A Study of World Cycles in Greek, Latin and Arabic Sources by Godefroid de Callatay (1995).
Von Dechend's confusion of the 'Great Year with precession and the 'Precessional Year'
In Introduction to Cosmology: A Preliminary Reconnaissance (1961, Pages 72-74) the concept of the 'Great Year' is confused with precession and the concept of the 'Precessional Year.' The figure of 36,000 is attributed to Plato as the figure for the 'Precessional Year.' Firstly, Plato's 36,000 year length is linked to the idea of powerful conjunctions and is not linked to the idea of precession (or to the solstices and equinoxes). Secondly, Plato never actually gives a figure. Later commentators assumed 36,000 years. Thomas Heath (Aristarchus of Samos (1913, Page 172)) suggested that Hipparchus might have been influenced by Plato's ‘Great Year' in his initial estimates of the period of precession. Ptolemy's 'Great Year' was determined by the return of all heavenly bodies to the same position. In later Greek and Latin texts this cosmic period of Plato is called the 'Great Year.' Precession is not necessarily involved.
Abe Aronow remembers being told by Giorgio de Santillana that ancient astronomers could measure 1/72 of a degree per year.
Recently, the confusion appears to have been made on a reasonably regular basis, presumably because both the 'Great Year' and the 'Precessional Year' are long periods. Walter Cruttenden of the so-called Binary Research Institute (which is criticised for its pseudoscience) believes there is some connection between the 'Great Year' and precession. Cruttendon and others believe that knowledge of the 'Great Year' (= Precessional Year) was perhaps not necessarily measured but generally expressed as "up and down cycles," "golden ages," "dark ages," the Yuga cycles and the like. The precession, the churning or turning mill, influences good times and bad times. Note: The idea of precession affecting the rise and fall of civilizations is indicated as existing/originating in the European Middle Ages. "One other thing was absolutely certain to the Church – in no way could a human being's freewill be nullified by the stars. This was expressed many times by the Paris Theology Faculty in the various condemnations of 1270, 1277 and 1398.148 Freewill and hence moral responsibility were to be preserved at all costs. Another controversial aspect was the way that sacred history interacted with astrology. Each civilisation had its own planet and as the equinoxes moved through their stately procession over 36,000 years, empires rose and fell. But once again, there was a conflict with divine providence – did not Israel fall to Sargon II (r. 721BC – 705BC) because the Lord willed it? An astrologer had to tread carefully if he was to avoid belittling the role God played in steering the divine plan." (Cecco D’Ascoli and Church Discipline of Natural Philosophers in the Middle Ages, by James Hannam (Dissertation submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of the Arts in Historical Research at Birkbeck College, University of London, 2003, Page 17).)
(5) The claim for a Neolithic zodiac
The astronomical basis of ancient myth is murkily argued at length by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend. The zodiacal constellations, though not clearly treated, form the backdrop to the speculations set out in Hamlet's Mill. They proposed the reason that the zodiac was developed was to describe 'disasters' that were believed to occur cyclically after long time intervals (i.e., approximately every 2000 years per an equally divided 12-constellation zodiac). The authors of Hamlet's Mill (page 245) place "Time Zero" near 5000 BCE and relate such to the junction of Galaxy and ecliptic. "[I]t was ... a reference point from which Precession could be imagined to have taken its start ... when the vernal equinoctial sun left its position in Gemini." Hugo Winckler, the originator of Panbabylonism, contended that the zodiac was recognised when the vernal equinoctial constellation was the Twins circa 6000-4000 BCE.
Hamlet's Mill perpetuates the erroneous assumption that the zodiacal constellations were recognised/established at the same time and place. The Mesopotamian astronomical texts show that this was not the case. The origin of what were to become the zodiacal constellations occurred more or less individually over some 500-600 years. Perhaps some constellations originated outside Mesopotamia. The evidence shows that the constellations which were to form the final zodiacal 12, though established over some time, were formulated into a zodiacal scheme of 12 at the same time and place - Babylonia circa the 5th-century BCE. Research still needs to focus on the origin of the individual constellations as far as that is possible (i.e., a historical perspective developed for each). Some of this work has already been done.
The myth of a prehistoric 12-constellation zodiac (of equal divisions) is not yet extinguished. De Santillana and von Dechend are believed by followers of their book Hamlet's Mill to have shown the extremely ancient character of an evenly divided 12-constellation zodiac. There even appears to be a belief that the zodiac originated as 12 equal divisions. George St. Clair (Myths of Greece Explained and Dated (2 volumes, 1901)) pioneered the use of simply assuming an early equally-spaced 12-constellation zodiac to explain mythology. The technique reached its zenith with the book Hamlet's Mill (1969). The suggestion that the zodiac was originally established as an intended scheme of 12 constellations and 12 equal



divisions some 6000 years ago (or even earlier) is untenable. The authors seem unaware that such views have been long discarded. The tide of claims up to the early 20th-century for the great antiquity of the zodiac (made by many historians, astronomers and Assyriologists) have been definitively discredited by an understanding of relevant Mesopotamian cuneiform sources. Nineteenth-century arguments made frequent
(misplaced) use of mythology and symbolism i.e., Recherches sur le culte public et les mystères de Mithra en Orient et en Occident by (the French archaeologist) Félix Lajard (1867). The idea that a 12-constellation equally divided Babylonian zodiac originated circa 6000 BCE (enthusiastically promoted by the Panbabylonists Fritz Hommel (Semiticist) and Alfred Jeremias (Archaeologist)) did not begin to be entirely discarded until the pioneering work of Franz Kugler on Babylonian astronomy began appearing. There is no evidence that the Greek scheme of 12 zodiacal constellations existed anywhere prior to its evolvement in Greece circa 500 BCE. The Assyriologist Peter Jensen was the first to show, in his book Die Kosmologie der Babylonier (1890), that the Greek zodiac (and zodiacal constellation names) was adapted (with few changes) from the (newly developed) zodiacal scheme of the Babylonians.
The pioneering work on Babylonian astronomy was the monumental Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel (1907-1935, 2 volumes and 3 supplements in 7 parts) by the Jesuit mathematician and Assyriologist Franz Kugler. He clearly demonstrated the late origin of Babylonian scientific astronomy and convincingly demonstrated that the Babylonians had a late and sidereal zodiac and a late mathematical astronomy. This meant that precession could not have been marked at an early date through either the constellations or signs of the zodiac. Also, from his study of cuneiform texts, Kugler pointed out that the concept of precessional movement of the tropical points through ecliptic constellations was not contained in early Babylonian astronomical texts. There is nothing in the Babylonian texts to prove a Twins-, Bull-, and Ram-period of precession. The later studies of the mathematicians Otto Neugebauer and Bartel van der Waerden on cuneiform astronomy have clearly shown that the zodiac originated in Mesopotamia and not earlier than the 1st millennium BCE. It was not handed down to the Babylonians from an earlier culture. (Bartel van der Waerden believed he had succeeded in reconstructing a mathematical science that must have existed in the Neolithic Period between 3000 and 2500 BCE, and spread from Central Europe.)
Incredibly, de Santillana and von Dechend believe that after 3000 years of writing a supposedly extant and ancient zodiacal scheme is finally only attested by writing circa 500 BCE. What they believe is early diffusion is actually late diffusion. With cultural contacts and cultural exchange the zodiac (a Babylonian 5th-century BCE invention) came into use as the international reference system for the fixed stars.
Before being used for astrological speculation the zodiac was an astronomical development whose stages are recoverable from Babylonian astronomical cuneiform texts dating from circa 1000 BCE with the Mul.Apin series. The zodiac of signs was invented for use as a reference point in mathematical astronomy. The Babylonian origin of the zodiac is assured on the basis of cuneiform documentation. (In the Path of the Moon: Babylonian Celestial Divination and Its Legacy (2010) by Francesca Rochberg (Chapter Seven: Babylonian Contribution to Hellenistic
Astrology); The Heavenly Writing: Divination, Horoscopy, and Astronomy in Mesopotamian Culture (2004) by Francesca Rochberg (Chapter 4: Sources for Horoscopes in Astronomical Texts).) Babylonian equivalents of the names of constellations later used for the divisions of the zodiac occur in Babylonian star lists and other cuneiform texts of the 1st-millennium BCE. The earliest cuneiform evidence for the existence of the 12sign 'ecliptic' zodiac comes from 5th-century BCE astronomical diaries (Number -453 iv 2, Number -440 rev.3', and Number -418:5, 10 rev.8' and 14'). (Babylonian Horoscopes (1998) by Francesca Rochberg (Chapter 3: Elements of a Babylonian Zodiac).) The concept of the zodiac cannot be found anywhere else before the 5th-century BCE (the pre-Seleucid, Babylonian Persian (Achaemenid) Period). "One can posit the following steps in the development of the zodiac, although it must be said that our knowledge of how the zodiac was first developed is provisional. The division of the schematic calendar into 12 months of 30 days each, such as was used in MUL.APIN, the Astrolabes, and Enūma Anu Enlil, could be correlated with twelve constellations through which the sun was found to travel in one ideal "year" of twelve 30-day months. Because the spring equinox, which was always close to the beginning of the Babylonian year, was to occur in Nisannu (I.15 according to the tradition of MUL.APIN) then Nisannu, or month I, was when the sun was in the constellation Aries (MUL.LÚ.HUN.GA = Agru "the hired man"). For each ideal month, the sun's position in the sky could be identified by the name of a constellation but schematized to correlate the sun's passage through the constellations with the twelve 30-day intervals. The result would be an association of twelve 30-day months and twelve constellations, later standardized to
intervals of 30o along the ecliptic." (The Heavenly Writing: Divination, Horoscopy, and Astronomy in Mesopotamian Culture (2004) by Francesca Rochberg (Chapter 4: Sources for Horoscopes in Astronomical Texts, Page 129).)
Note: At least one supporter of Hamlet's Mill maintains that the zodiac was devised to describe 'disasters' that occurred cyclically after long time intervals.
Two references for Bartel van der Waerden are listed in the bibliography of Hamlet's Mill. Interestingly, not listed (or considered) is his important article, "History of the Zodiac." (Archiv für Orientforschung, Volume 16, Pages 216-230). This very detailed discussion of the development of the zodiac sets out the circa 420 BCE date for the consolidation of the zodiac of 12 equal divisions.
The "American Zodiac"
Von Dechend was keen to find evidence of a western zodiac in the ancient Americas. "The Americanists, of whom I happen to know that they have tried to get wise to the "American Zodiac" - I am convinced that there are crowds of forgotten scholars to be rediscovered - are Stansbury Hagar, Fritz Roek, both of whom sound rather arbitrary and, nowadays, David H. Kelley ...." (Introduction to ancient Cosmology by Hertha von Dechend (1966, Page 144).)
(1) Stansbury Hagar (1869-1942) was a Counsellor-at-Law (as he liked to describe himself) in New York City. He was also an avocational ethnologist. Ethnology was engaged in as a hobby. Though throughout his career Hagar was usually highly thought of as an ethnologist his ideas and conclusions are now rarely cited by professional anthropologists/ethnologists. A reason why Stansbury Hagar is overlooked present-day is the recognition that he was prone to make speculative interpretations. He was an ardent cultural diffusionist. He was also an avid supporter of the solar mythology school. He was also an avid supporter of the solar mythology school.Hagar is most probably to be classed as a minor ethnologist. Hagar has been enthusiastically (uncritically) described as an expert on Mesopotamian archaeoastronomy. He contributed numerous articles on ethnology and astronomy to various scientific journals. His favourite theme was a common zodiac existing throughout the Americas (literally a zodiacal cult) prior to Columbus. (See especially his review of the pamphlet Las Constelaciones del Orión y de las Hiadas by the German anthropologist/ethnologist Robert Lehmann-Nitzsche (1921) in American Anthropologist, New Series, Volume 24, 1922, Pages 217-219.) He believed he had identified a zodiac in the stucco decorations of the facade of a pyramid at the Mayan city of Acanceh. He also believed he had identified a zodiac at the Santa Rita Mayan Ruin, and he also attempted to make the identification of a Mayan zodiac at Palenque. His paper on "The Maya Zodiac of Santa Rita" was presented on the last day of the General Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America, December 2931, 1916. The General Meeting was a joint session at Washington with the Nineteenth International Congress of Americanists. His attempts to identify astronomical patterns in Peruvian and other landscapes are most likely mistaken. The Inca concept of sovereignty and the Spanish administration in Peru by Charles Gibson (1920-1985 (University of Texas, Degree of Master of Arts, in June, 1947 (published 1948, University of Texas Press; reprinted 1969) states: "Attempts to relate the urban form of Cuzco and other Peruvian sites to a wider astronomical pattern are probably failures (Page 34?)." His misguided attempts to reconstruct the constellations of the Inca were made on his erroneous assumption that they were identical to Greek and Roman constellations. (As example: Hagar believed that the Mayan temples at Izamal, Yucatan, were based upon



the zodiacal constellations (which matched the Greek zodiac) as symbols. Also according to Hagar the Peruvian temples at Cuzco had exactly the same significance.) According to Stansbury Hagar all old American temples in Yucatan (Maya) and Mexico (Aztec) were planned and executed after a cosmic scheme. (The Annual Prospectus, Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, Department of Education, (1917, Page 148), lists: "April 6. Conference on "The Temples of Uxinal, Yucatan." conducted by Stansbury Hagar.) Journal of the National Institute of Social Sciences (Volume 10, 1925) noted: "Stansbury Hagar has been engaged in the preparation for eventual publication of his complete studies on the symbolism of the zodiac in ... [Mesoamerica]." Hager's beliefs and imagination enabled him to publish claims for a (common) solar zodiac amongst the Mayas, Aztecs, and Peruvians that resemble the Old World solar zodiac. He saw this as evidence for one-way trips across the Atlantic by mariners from the Mediterranean. On March 30, 1912, under the auspices of the Brooklyn Institute, Hagar gave a public lecture on "The Mexican Zodiac." The Brooklyn Institute of Arts & Sciences, Department of Education, Prospectus for 1915-1916 contains: "Apr. 1 - Conference on "The Zodiacal Symbolism of the Snake Dance and Other Hopi Ceremonies," to be conducted by Stansbury Hagar, MA, Secretary, Department of Ethnology, Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences." Mostly on the basis of the pre-Columbian game of Wolttěstomkwon Hagar (American Anthropologist, 1895) suggested there were connections between the Micmacs and the Maya (of Mexico).
(2) Fritz Roek is, I believe, a mistake for the Americanist Fritz Röck (1879-1953), a Viennese ethnologist. In 1914 he was appointed to head the Anthropology and Ethnology Department of the Austrian-Hungarian Naturhistorisches Museum (Museum of Natural History), formally opened in 1884. From 1928 (1927?) to 1945 he was the Direktor des Museums für Völkerkunde (Direktor des Völkerkundemuseum Wien) (MVK). Fritz Röck was a Germanophilic scholar of Mexican ethnology. He was a member of the 'Mythological School' (another term used for the Star-Myth Movement). The Star-Myth Movement laid emphasis on the predominant importance of the Moon ("Panlunarism") and also the Sun. In the 1930's by Fritz Röck and the Viennese Study Group for African Culture History originated "ethnohistory." Ethnohistory was an attempt to understand the histories of cultures by using a wide range of (historical) ethnographic data (a holistic approach) rather than the standard approach of remaining
limited to written texts. Relevant books: Kalender, Sternglaube und Weltbilder der Tolteken als Zeugen verschollener Kulturbeziehungen zur Alten Welt (1922); Ein mythisch-religöses Motiv der alten Mayakunst (1924); Kalendarkreise [Kalenderkreise] und Kalendarschichten im alten Mexiko und Mittelamerika (1928); Chiuhnauteca und Cempoalteca, die altmexikanischen Neuner- und Zwanzigerleute : ein Beitrag zur kulturhistorischen Zahlen- und Kalenderkunde (1930).
(3) David Kelley (1924-2011) was a Canadian American archaeologist and epigrapher and a brilliant scholar. He was a pioneer in key developments in the phonetic decipherment of Maya hieroglyphic writing. However, he held many speculative ideas relating to calendars and archaeoastronomy. He was a "diffusionist" of the "old school" and wrote on many "fringe" topics. Old school diffusionism = Wherever a story which consists of the same combination of several elements is found in 2 regions (geographic locations), it must be concluded that its occurrence in both is due to diffusion. This applied to many of his ideas about the relationships between world-wide calendar systems and his ideas about archaeoastronomy. He is infamous in archaeological circles for his advocacy of long-range cultural diffusion, from Southeast Asia to Mesoamerica and also from Egypt to Mesoamerica. In other words, despite his erudition, in parts of his scholarship he is really no different from any number of other hyperdiffusionist pseudoarchaeologists postulating multiple events of long-range cultural contact on the basis of minimal or no evidence. The article by David Kelley that created interest (and still does) is "Calendar Animals and Deities." (Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, Volume 16, Number 3, Autumn 1960, Pages 317-337). It is a comparison of certain similarities in calendrical lists from Mesoamerica, Eurasia, and Polynesia. It is perhaps an extension/continuation of, "Our Brother Coyote." his unpublished doctoral dissertation, Harvard University, which contains a discussion of special relationships between Polynesia and Mesoamerica. Opening paragraphs of "Calendar Animals and Deities.": "The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to certain similarities of sequence in names found in calendrical lists. The similarities considered are primarily found in animal names; however, some attention is given to other names, lists from Eurasia and especially those of deities. Major emphasis is on calendrical with some remarks the named lunar nights of Polynesia. on Mesoamerica, The most important lists involved are: 1. The named lunar houses. These are sequences of 27 or 28 named constellations from China, Persia, Arabia, Egypt, India, and some other areas of Eurasia. The Indian material is found in markedly different forms from Jain and Hindu sources; there is also a Hindu list of the deities who ruled each of these constellations. 2. A sequence of 27-30 "lunar animals" known from China, Southeast Asia, and Greece. The Greek list includes one section of object names rather than animal names. 3. A sequence of named "nights of the moon" from Polynesia. 4. Several lists of 20 day-names, following one another in unbroken sequence, such as the Aztecs, Mayas, Zapotecs, Mixes, from various Mesoamerican groups Otomis, Mixtecs, et al. There is an Aztec list of the deities ruling these days. The names are not cognates from one linguistic group to another; the meanings in some cases are easily translatable and are often the same from one group to another; in other cases, the meaning of the names is obscure or complete (sic) untranslatable. The Aztec list differs from the others in the fact that all of the names are of easily determined meaning, ten of the names being animals. This simplicity has usually been interpreted as indicating a relatively late standardization from earlier, more esoteric, lists. However, in Eurasia one finds that lists of animals, symbols, and deities coexisted, and this suggests that they might also coexist in Mesoamerica, whether one takes a diffusionist view or the view that parallel systems will tend to produce parallel results."
Note: The zodiac devised by the ancient Maya was different to the ancient Babylonian zodiac and ancient Greek zodiac. The ancient Maya developed their own zodiac. Susan Milbrath had made a compelling argument that the Maya zodiac consisted of thirteen groups of stars that cycled every twenty-eight days. Interestingly there are differences in the order of the images of constellations in the various Maya Postclassic codices and also where they are depicted on the façades of Maya buildings, painted murals, and carved stone monuments from the Classic period. Because the order of the depicted images varies, researchers have not reached agreement on what constellation each image represents.
The origin of the constellations
"Let us repeat a few essentials , enriched with some additional remarks.
The coining of constellations was said to be the conditio sine qua no of astronomia, in so far as the constellations represent the reference system (or a rudimentary system of coordinates) without which the motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets could not be "told", nor the results of observations be expressed in language, and handed down to later generations.
The coining of constellations has been accomplished by Upper Palaeolithic men. ... The Upper Palaeolithic is supposed to have started around 40,000, or even 80 000 (sic), but the Radiocarbon 14-date given for the Aurignacien-station of Les Eyzies (Dordogne), 23600 ±800. ...
The constellations were not meant to resemble the animals after which they were named, but they were called after those species, the mating (or breeding) time of which they indicated by their rising. ...
The constellations were not meant to ressemble (sic) the animals after which they were named, but they were called after those species, the mating (or breeding) time of which they indicated by their rising. Admittedly, in none of the relevant sources, could I find the word "heliacal rising", and that is not to be wondered at: the travellers, missionaries, colonial administrators, ethnographers, and ethnologists were not -- and still are not -familiar with the technical language of astronomers; it is far more astonishing that we have been informed at all of the significance of the rising of constellations by some of these travellers and missionaries, most of these rare birds having done their work during the last cenury (sic) [century] or earlier, or at the beginning of our own .... Since, however, Babylonians, Egyptians and Greeks were primarily concerned with heliacal risings, it is



reasonable to assume that this concern goes back to earlier times. Rhere (sic) [There] is one stumbling block, however, quite a substantial one, namely, our superimportant (sic) bear: Ursa Major, being circumpolar continuously, does not fit into the scheme of heliacal risings. In order to find out which "phase", or position of the Ursa stars gave the signal for the bear ceremonies, one would have to go over the whole array of source material .... As far as I remember, the bear festivals of Finns and Lapps were due at [the] winter solstice.
Minimal remarks have to be made with regard to the diffusion of constellations and star names, so that you do not expect in vain to find exactly the same "images" everywhere. To understand this circumstance you gave (sic) [have] to consider the phenomenon which Arthur Kroeber caleed (sic) [called] "stimulus diffusion". Stimulus diffusion means: diffused has been, in very many cases, the "principle" or "idea" of a thing, not necessarily the thing itself .... Accordingly, what has been adopted around the globe, was first the upperpalaeolithic (sic) idea of delimiting constellations, and to give to most of them the names of animals or, sometimes, of edible plants, or even of an implement; with the Kham, e.g., Canopus was the "star of the digging stick". In the same manner, there has been adopted, in later times, the more specific idea of the Zodiac, i.e. the Belt or Cercle (sic) [Circle] of animals being understood as the houses, stations, vehicles and garments of the planets. In other words, it would be rather thoughkless (sic) [thoughtless] to expect the Zodiac (or lunar mansions, or decans) of [the] Maya and Aztecs [and the Chinese] to be congruent in every detail to that of Babylonians, Egyptians, Indians, and Greeks: their astronomers were sufficiently brainy and creative to invent their own arrangements." (Introduction to Cosmology (1979).)
(6a) The claim for 'world ages'
Hamlet's Mill emphasises the role of astronomy in the shaping of early civilisations' conceptions of time.
According to the author's of Hamlet's Mill many ancient cultures believed in 'World Ages.' In Introduction to Cosmology: A Preliminary Reconnaissance by Hertha von Dechend and Giorgio de Santillana (1961, Page 66) they claim that there was a rapid adoption of world ages in 4000 BCE: "The rapid adoption of world ages in 4000 B.C. would seem to indicate remarkable intellectual flexibility. Was there a preceding idea which prompted it? Moreover, this change tells us something about the state of theology. If the gods are seen as the prisoners of a mechanism which compels at every age a change of rulership, then the real power is in the mechanism and not in the gods." This involved belief in 'Cycles of 'Dark and Golden Ages'' (= cycles of consciousness rising and falling). These ancient cultures are stated to have rather accurately known the length of the precessional cycle and also the length of a zodiacal age. (The authors of Hamlet's Mill believed that precession was discovered by circa 4000 BCE at least. However, with what accuracy is subject to changing ideas by the authors. In Introduction to Cosmology: A Preliminary Reconnaissance by Hertha von Dechend and Giorgio de Santillana (1961, Page 34a) they write that "The ancient estimated figure for precession was 36000 years." The assertion that ancient cultures viewed history as comprised of periodic cycles (a progression of changing world ages) is associated with the precession of the equinoxes and is tied by de Santillana/von Dechend to their assumption that an equally divided 12constellation zodiac had been established in archaic times. No evidence exists for an equally divided 12-constellation zodiac before circa 500 BCE. The fantasies of de Santillana/von Dechend that ancient cultures viewed the world in terms of zodiac-based cyclic time (driven by precession) fail on this crucial point. Precession is held to be described mythically in terms of catastrophes. (It has been asserted that de Santillana and von Dechend believed the zodiac was invented to described cyclical disasters.) Also, the archaic myths are held to embody precession-based cataclysmic fears. De Santillana and von Dechend set out that the precession of the equinoxes through a 12-part equally divided zodiac was expressed in terms of universal/catastrophic floods. Although change due to precession occurs extremely slowly it is asserted by de Santillana and von Dechend that it was expressed in mythology in terms of violent catastrophes (floods) - due to an apparent shift in the rising of a zodiacal sign of 30 degrees and the apparent shift also of the setting of a zodiacal sign of 30 degrees. This in spite of the fact that nothing violent is suggested by the slow gradual process of precession proceeding at the almost imperceptible rate of about 1° in 72 years.
Note: Two key themes that are given particular attention are: (1) the 'derangement of the heavens,' and (2) ancient worldwide cataclysms.
According to Eduard Stucken (Astralmythen) there was an early calendar, and a scheme of succession of ages was established through the movement of the planets (especially the sun and moon) and the zodiac. Both Winckler and Jeremias maintained that Babylonian history from the pre-historic period was divided into 3 major periods that correspond to the signs/constellations, Gemini, Taurus, and Aries. It was held by Winckler and Jeremias that if we do not take into account these ‘cosmic ages’ then we will be unable to understand the history of the ancient Near East. According to Jeremias it was during the 'age of Taurus' that Babylon became the metropolis of the world. Also, according to the Panbabylonist Alfred Jeremias, "An oriental history without consideration of the world-era is unthinkable. The stars rule the changes of the times." The Panbabylonists/astral mythologists conceded that there is no trace of a Ram motif in Babylonian mythology. Winckler's claim for 3 astrological World-Ages do not really correspond with his periods of history.
It is not explained why Babylonian astral sciences have no concept of zodiacal world ages or simply world ages per Hamlet's Mill. If this knowledge originated in the ancient Near East it is not explained why the Babylonians were not heir to it. The assyriologist Alasdair Livingstone, dealing with problems posed by the claim by Werner Papke for a high standard of astronomical knowledge being achieved shortly after the invention of writing, pointed out that it must be envisaged: (1) this astronomical knowledge did not subsequently develop and was ultimately forgotten, and (2) this astronomical knowledge had no appreciable effect on the rest of Babylonian "science." These same points apply to the claim put in Hamlet's Mill. Jeremias lay special stress on zodiacal world ages. This latter idea is picked up and by de Santillana and von Dechend and underpins their book Hamlet's Mill as 'world ages.'
The idea of zodiacal eras marked by the (shifting) location of the vernal equinox in a constellation and dating back to circa 5000 BCE is not exactly original with the Panbabylonism school and precedes it (e.g., Creation Records Discovered in Egypt by George St. Clair (1898)).
Cultures heavily dependent upon agricultural practices seem unaware of precession either by: (1) slow changes in the sky (i.e., altered heliacal rising of stars, or 'tilting' of the sky evidenced at the horizon; or (2) the calendrical use of the stars.
Even granting that precession was detected and understood in the pre-historic period it remains difficult to accept that this extremely slow change for the displacement of the polestar - the perception of which requires thousands of years - could have given rise to a world-wide belief in the cataclysmic end of all things with flood and fire and earthquakes. The reality is when one pole star is displaced by another, no disaster ensues, either on Earth or in the Cosmos.
Supposed Classical World era system
Regarding the belief that there was a huge celebration in Rome focusing on the Pax Augustus and the beginning of a New World Era circa the time of Jesus Christ. The classicist John McMahon wrote (Hastro-L 18.04.2000): "The celebration was that of the so-called Secular Games (*ludi saeculares*), designed to commemorate the end of one *saeculum* and the beginning of another. A *saeculum* represented a period of 100 yrs., roughly the lonsgest (sic) span of a human life. The ceremony marking this took place in the Campus Martius and is not well attested in early Republican times. The first "authentic" Secular Games took place in 249 BCE; the next in 146 (despite Livy's date of 149).



By the next century there was concern about the celebration, but none took place in the proper time frame. Augustus seems to have been planning games in the 20s BCE and were referred to in passages of Vergil's *Aeneid* ("published" in 19), but the "official" celebration took place in 17 BCE. Special arrangements were made for these games so that they would usher in not just a new *saeculum* but a new era as well, clearly echoing the Augustan program of a return to the Golden Age (*Aetas Aurea*) of Saturn in Italy and promoted by Vergil in his works (including the Fourth Eclogue mentioned above) and Horace (*Epode* 16) as the results of the benevolent rule of Augustus. The concept of the Golden Age goes back at least as far as Hesiod's *Works and Days* and probably derives ultimately from some contact with ideas from the Ancient Near East.
The Secular Games of 17 BCE themselves were changed from their earlier format to include three days of activity honoring Jupiter, Juno, Diana, and Apollo, the patron god of Augustus, who had built a temple to the diety (sic) on the Palatine. It was there and then on the Capitol that Horace's *Carmen Saeculare*, written specifically for these games, was performed by a choir of 27 boys and girls. Seven days of additional, and more conventional, entertainment. The period of the *saeculum* was also fixed at 110 years, although the emperor Claudius had the games celebrated again in 48 CE (on the 800th anniversary of Rome's founding) while others occurred (roughly) back on schedule in later centuries.
As to whether Vergil was considered a "saint," I think that "seer" or even "magician" would be a better term. In fact, the *Aeneid* itself was consulted as an oracle by the so-called *sortes Vergilianae*, whereby the text itself was seen (like Homer) to contain all human learning and randomly chosen passages were interpreted as indicators of the future or to give advice."
The invention of zodiacal/precessional world ages
Astrological (= zodiacal) ages is an modern astrological concept with its origins in speculations about astronomical mythology, and the antiquity of astronomical knowledge. The determination of the starting dates of the astrological ages are without consensus and are dependent on the numerous methods of calculation used. The introduction of the imaginary system of 12 zodiacal signs was a late Babylonian mathematical device that redefined constellations along the ecliptic. Its introduction is not indicated as being connected with astral omenology. The precession of the equinoxes determines so-called precessional (zodiacal) ages. Some modern popular belief systems (such as astrological mythology, and Theosophical beliefs and New Age beliefs derived from Theosophy) imagine that the so-called zodiacal (astrological) ages distinctively influence historical events. (In popular culture, the "Age of Aquarius" simply refers to the advent of the New Age movement in the 1960s and 1970s.) Nonspeculative evidence for an ancient theory of successive precessional 'world ages' (let alone their supposed influence) is wanting. Attempts to identify indicators for the use of zodiacal 'world ages' in the Hellenistic world usually refer to the peculiar arguments of David Ulansey for precessional knowledge in Mithraism (i.e., the realisation of moving tropical points). See for example: A Postmodern Revelation: Signs of Astrology and the Apocalypse by Jacques Chevalier (1997, Page 76). Speculative evidence for an ancient theory of precessional ages - such as David Ulansey's ideas on Mithraism - abound. Ulansey claims that Mithraism had a cosmology associated with the precession of the equinoxes and the signs of the zodiac. Arguing for the idea of astrological world ages originating in the ancient world is one thing; providing evidence that the idea was also linked to the precession of the equinoxes is quite another. The concept of precession-based zodiacal "world ages" is largely a 19th-century Theosophical concept largely invented by the occultist Helena Blavatsky. But Godfrey Higgins was a major influence on Blavatsky. In her publications Blavatsky discussed a variety of belief systems involved with astronomical cycles. In a footnote to an 1888 article Blavatsky asserted there was a cycle founded on the precession of the equinoxes and the signs of the zodiac. Earlier, in her book Isis Unveiled (2 Volumes, 1877) Blavatsky mentioned the statements by Charles Dupuis, Constantin Volney, and Godfrey Higgins regarding cycles. Nick Campion identifies that the concept draws "partly on Hesiod's sequence of ages outlined in the Works and Days, the Hindu Yugas, some 19th century studies of comparative religion and Madame Blavatsky's own theory of racial and spiritual evolution (Hastro-L, 13 April, 2000)." (The 'world ages' concept of Zervanism and Hesiod seems irrelevant because of lack of connection with astronomy.) The theosophists came up with the idea of each twelfth division of the approximate 26000 year precession cycle in which the vernal equinox was in a particular division of the zodiac and gave this 2160 year period associated astrological characteristics with what astrological sign the vernal equinox was in. However, the concept of precessional "world ages" can also be traced back to Origine des tous les cultes: ou, Religion universelle by Charles Dupuis (1794). Also influential was Anacalypsis (2 Volumes, 1833-1836) by Godfrey Higgins who asserted the Chaldeans had a cyclical system of world ages of 2160 years each. Higgins claimed that a cycle of precessional astrological (world) ages of 2160 years each was discovered by the Chaldeans and was subject to encoding in language by use of significant names and phrases, and letters having having numerical equivalents. In all of this speculation ancient constellation boundaries remains an issue. The constellations are all of uneven size and we have no knowledge of the boundaries of any early constellations. We have no knowledge of even the boundaries of the Greek constellation scheme of Aratus of Soli circa 275 BCE.
More modern proponents of ancient knowledge of precession and/or a system of zodiacal world ages are the French occultist René Adolphe Schwaller de Lubicz (1887–1961) , and the Swiss mystic, psychiatrist, and psychotherapist Carl Jung (1875-1961). In his Sacred Science: The King of Pharaonic Theocracy (1961), René Adolphe Schwaller de Lubicz claimed knowledge of precession in ancient Egypt. In his Aion (1951, also in Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Volume 9, Part 2) Carl Jung popularised the concept of astrological ages. The original 2 Swiss editions had different subtitles: "Researches into the History of Symbols" and then "Contributions to the Symbolism of the Self."
The fact that societies were organised according to models of the cosmos and also that there were prophetic theories of history does not mean that ancient (e.g., Hellenistic) astrologers believed in an Ages of Pisces or or an Age of Aquarius any more than they believed in other aspects of modern astrology.
Some miscellaneous points
Zodiacal world ages are not indicated by myths and symbols. See the detailed discussion in: "Critique of Alexander Gurshtein's Theory of Constellation Development." by Gary D. Thompson (Page 9c).
The "changes in symbolism" argument used by the authors of Hamlet's Mill to claim that the shift from an "Age of Twins" to an "Age of Taurus" to an "Age of Aries" to an "Age of Fish(es) is identifiable suffers from the dual burden of wishful thinking and absence of evidence. If the early Church used the Vesica Piscesas the symbol of Jesus Christ with the intention to promote Jesus Christ as the Lord of the Age of the Fish then why in all early Christian writings, including those that deal with cosmology and history (including Gnostic texts), is there no mention of this? How is it known that this was their intent? "At time Zero (say, 5000 B.C. - there are reasons for this approximate date), the sun was in Gemini; it moved ever so slowly from Gemini into Taurus, then Aries, then Pisces, which it still occupies and will for some centuries more. The advent of Christ the Fish marks our age. ... The preceding age, that of Aries, had been heralded by Moses coming down from Mount Sinai as "two-horned," that is, crowned with Ram's horns, while his flock disobediently insisted upon dancing around the "Golden Calf" that was, rather, a "Golden Bull," Taurus (Hamlet's Mill, Pages 59-60; see also Page 44)." (Interestingly, Hertha von Dechend, though raising the possibility of such an interpretation in her M.I.T. seminar notes, stated she did not favour this particular explanation.) If Moses had horns it is nowhere stated that these were anything to do with Aries. If we were to accept Moses as a actual person the conception his conception of the zodiac would more likely have been that Aries was the Babylonian hired-man/labourer than the much later Greek ram. Additionally, the voyage of the Argonauts for the Golden Fleece (of a ram) introduces the "Age of Aries" (Hamlet's Mill, Page 318).



Interpretations for the date of the fancied change from an 'Age of Taurus' to an 'Age of Aries' range from circa 2150 BCE to circa 1875 BCE. Several major problems are obvious with the Moses example. Firstly, the period of Moses presented in the Hebrew bible is dated between circa 1500 BCE and 1200 BCE. This is some 650/950 years or 375/675 years after the alleged beginning of the 'Age of Aries.' Secondly, the Ram is demonstrably a Greek constellation dating no earlier than circa 500 BCE. There was no Mesopotamian Ram constellation. It is uncertain whether there was an Egyptian Ram constellation/asterism. According to the astronomer Juan Belmonte the southern constellation (decan) sit or srt (seret) on the ceiling of Senmut's tomb could be a sheep (woolly usually horned ruminant mammal related to the goat), ram (male sheep), or goat (hollow-horned bearded ruminant mammal related to the sheep) = Capricornus or perhaps the stars in the area of Grus and Piscis Austrinus. (See: Belmonte, Juan. and Shaltout, Mosalam. (2009, Reprinted 2010). (Editors). In Search of Cosmic Order: Selected Essays on Egyptian Archaeoastronomy.) This constellation/decan was not connected with the stars of Aries.
Other writers like to add in further examples such as the slaying of the Cretan Minotaur symbolising the end of the "Age of Taurus." The cult of the Apis bulls in Ancient Egypt is held to represent the "Age of Taurus" and the Amun cult in Egypt is held to represent the "Age of Aries."
The "changes in symbolism" argument, which goes back to the 19th-century, easily collapses with only a few criticisms. There is no evidence that a large number of Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, for the story of the Exodus being real, or that there was 40 years of "wilderness wandering" in the Sinai desert. The date of Moses is usually given as circa 1500 BCE. There was no zodiac circa 1500 BCE. so it is impossible to have zodiacal world ages at this early date. Certainly there was no scheme for equally dividing the ecliptic, or other established convenient frame of coordinates, at this early date. As such equally timed changes in "world ages" is out of the question. In the case of Moses having horns we have a simple translation error. The Hebrew root KRN can be keren meaning "horn" or karan meaning "radiant." When the Hebrew bible was translated into Latin the Hebrew KRN was mistranslated as "horned" (and so instead of Moses' face being radiant it was horned). The "two-horned" tradition associated with Moses cannot be demonstrated to predate Jerome. (The name Jerome is the anglicization of Hieronymus. Jerome (340-420) was an Illyrian Christian priest from Dalmatia who translated the Bible into Latin.) It has not been demonstrated that the search by Greek heroes for the "Golden Fleece" has anything to do with a constellation or astronomy. The Golden Fleece of the Argonautica may be connected with the holy fleece of Hittite ritual. It was a Hittite custom to hang a container made from the skin of a sheep from a sacred evergreen tree in the centre of a grove. The fleece were decorated with gold and the sheep skin container filled with offerings to their gods/goddesses. However, it is common to interpret the Argonautica as an adventure story recalling how early Greek mariners searched for new territories to expand Greek trade.
The Cretan Minotaur was half bull and half man. Taurus is simply a truncated bull. Why exactly the Cretan Minotaur should represent the "zodiacal" bull (Taurus) is never explained. Why Theseus killing it should represent the end of the "Age of Taurus" is also never explained. Nothing at all is known of Minoan constellations so no proof of any intended association with a Minoan bull constellation is possible. The Apis bull was believed to be the incarnation of the Egyptian god Ptah. It has not been demonstrated that the Apis bull has anything to do with astronomy. The identification of native Egyptian constellations is mostly uncertain. The Apis bull has never been linked with a native Egyptian bull constellation (at any time - let alone during a supposed "Age of Taurus"). Chronologically the cult was more popular during the supposed "Age of Aries" than it was during the supposed "Age of Taurus." The Egyptian god Amun was originally frequently depicted as the Nile goose and later more frequently depicted as a ram, or as a ram-headed man. However, from the cult's beginning's Amun could be depicted as either a Nile goose or as a ram, or as a ram-headed man. Chronologically the cult originated in the supposed "Age of Taurus."
David Ulansey (The Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries (1989)) has never provided any evidence that 'zodiacal ages/astrological ages' was a concept understood anywhere at all in the ancient Greco-Roman world. (Ulansey claims that Mithraism had a cosmology associated with the precession of the equinoxes and the signs of the zodiac.)
In his Republic, Plato's emphasis on the organisation of the city-state is unconnected with the idea of 'zodiacal ages.' It has to do with modelling social organisation on the cosmos.
The argument that the early Catholic Church used Vesica Pisces as the symbol of Jesus Christ with the intent to promote Jesus Christ as the Lord of the Age of the Fish is without evidence. In all early Christian writings, including those that deal with cosmology and history (including Gnostic texts) there is no mention of any such thing.
(6b) Von Dechend's conception of the development of uranography, and dating
This scheme is given in her MIT seminar notes:
Period Development
Upper Palaeolithic Period (circa 40,000 BCE but at least by circa 25,000 BCE) Note: Modern dating usually circa 35,000 BCE to 8,000 BCE
Constellating of the entire visible sky
Neolithic Period (Hamlet's Mill, at least by 4000 BCE; seminar notes, at least by circa 5000 BCE)
Establishment of the equally divided 12 constellation zodiac
Neolithic Period (near 5000 BCE)
Establishment of precession ('Time Zero' related to the junction of Galaxy and ecliptic and was the reference point from which precession was imagined to have taken its start; when the vernal equinoctial sun left its position in Gemini.
Neolithic Period (circa 4000 BCE)
Rapid adoption/establishment of world (zodiacal) ages



In Hamlet's Mill, Page 63, they write" "At Time Zero, the two equinoctial "hinges" of the world had been Gemini and Sagittarius, spanning between them the arch of the Milky Way: both bicorporeal signs - and so were Pisces, and Virgo with her ear of wheat, at the other two corners - to mark the idea that the way (the Milky Way itself) was open between earth and heaven, the way up and the way down where men and gods could meet in that Golden Age. ... [T]he exceptional virtue of the Golden Age was precisely that the cross-roads of ecliptic and equator coincided with the crossroads ecliptic and Galaxy, namely in Gemini and Sagittarius, both constellations "standing" firmly at two of the four corners of the quadrangular earth."
"Due to the precession of the equinoxes, the churning apparatus is broken (or unhinged), Hamlet's milltree jumps out of the millstone, the whirlpool comes into being,; the Flood devours the whole 'world', alias one zodiacal sign equal to an age (E.g. the vernal equinox shifting from Gemini to Taurus, pulls Taurus out of the water and submerges Scorpius; the next move changes Aries (up till then a sword-fish) into a dry-land dweller, whereas Libra ceases to play Balance and is drowned). New fire has to be drilled/a new churn or mill built up; new crossroads must be marked by new omphaloi/navels, all of it requiring a lot of measuring and surveying; new names have to be provided for the new heaven and the new earth, the 4 pillars of the world, and for the rejuvenated actors. That is, the latter as a whole change change the family name, according to the new ruler, and much social uproar and disorder has to be appeased by means of new grading and classifying - heroes become gods and vice versa; etc. the stable factor, so to speak, remains the sun as the standard measure, and the investiture of Venus with the starry mantle, on occasion of the hieros gamos or 'sacred marriage' with the head of the new Dynasty." (Introduction to Cosmology (1961), Pages 169-170.)
This fantastic scheme (= extreme ideas) demonstrates no real understanding of the evidence. However, it is connected with their belief that they have broken part of an archaic astronomical/cosmological code (Hamlet's Mill, Page 5 (Introduction). They write: "The theory about "how the world began" seems to involve the breaking asunder of a harmony, a kind of cosmogonic "original sin" whereby the circle of the ecliptic (with the zodiac) was tilted up at an angle with respect to the equator, and the cycles of change came into being." However, they fail to establish that a myth conveys an idea, and a single idea at that.
The completely unjustifiable date they speculate for the establishment of an equally divided 12 constellation zodiac leads to other unsupported claims such as (Hamlet's Mill, Page 141): "The Pole star does get out of place, and every few thousand years another star has to be chosen which best approximates that position." Here the authors are confident that an astronomical system had been established (literally world-wide) throughout the Middle Neolithic and Bronze Age period with the understanding that the Pole Star established at a given time was not to be changed until every "few thousand years" (i.e., circa 2000 years).
How fast the monomyth was developed and diffused throughout the world is not discussed. The complicated monomyth is supposedly orally transmitted without loss of content or structure. Possible/likely changes to the monomyth are not discussed.
The authors of Hamlet's Mill basically locate the origins of zodiacal-based astronomical mythology in Mesopotamia. They also basically held that an early culture somewhere in the Near East were invented the concept of zodiacal-based world ages (due to the effects of precession). The Babylonians are the only realistic candidates for the concept of zodiacal-based "world ages." However, prior to the 5th-century BCE the Babylonians had no equally divided 12 constellation zodiac or scientific astronomy and could not have known of the concept of a Bull-period or precession. There is no evidence that a Bull constellation existed circa 3000 BCE (or earlier) let alone that the vernal equinox was noted to occur in such at this time. (The arguments of Willy Hartner are simply inadequate. The arguments for the constellation Taurus and the Pleiades asterism being depicted in the Lascaux Cave are hardly convincing.) Attempts to equate early Bull cults with the constellation Taurus lack proof. As for the claims of early Minoan astronomy nothing rises above the level of speculation. We do not have any knowledge of early Minoan astronomy (as no evidence has survived). Prior to the 1st-millennium BCE the ecliptic was not specifically marked in Babylonian astronomy (the "equatorial" path system of the "three stars each" was established). Some constellations that later formed part of the Babylonian 12 constellation zodiac were established circa 2000 BCE in Babylonia. Others were not established until circa 1000 BCE. There was no canonical set of constellations established in Mesopotamia. The claim that basic cultural symbols change (i.e., bull to ram to fish(es)) because of precession affecting the location of the vernal equinox in the zodiacal constellations does not withstand scrutiny.
(7) The claim the mill myth is astronomical
Like the Panbabylonists preceding her, Hertha von Dechend demonstrates imaginative zeal for finding coherence and system within a proposed astral scheme. De Santillana and von Dechend interpret the tale of a whirlpool at sea as a symbol of disturbance of the polar axis and linked this to precessional displacement.
De Santillana and von Dechend identify the Mill as the cosmos itself (the earth's precessional 'wobble') periodically (per zodiac divisions of time) breaking free of the timbers of the solstitial and equinoctial markers. A cosmic mill of the gods in medieval Scandinavia was a 19th-century development (partly inspired by Snorri Sturluson (1179-1241) an Icelandic historian, poet, chieftain and politician). The Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson is an important compendium of Norse mythology. The magical mill of medieval Scandinavian folklore was the work-tool of chthonic deities (beings dwelling under the earth) - sea nymphs and giantesses. (In the Icelandic legend of Amlodi, Amlodi's Mill is located at the bottom of the sea and ground Hamlet's flour.) See the complete demolition of the claim that the Mill of Scandinavian folklore is astronomical in: Amory, Frederick [Frederic]. (1977). "The Medieval Hamlet: A Lesson in the Use and Abuse of a Myth." (Deutsche Vierteljahresschrift für Literaturwissenschaft und Geistesgeschichte, Volume 51, Number 3, September, Pages 357-395). See this reference for numerous false or incorrect etymologies regarding Scandinavian mythology, engaged in by the authors of Hamlet's Mill.
The content of the myth of Amlodhi's Mill ('World Mill') as given by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus, explicitly states it is referring to the ocean. According to Saxo Grammaticus (Saxo Grammaticus was first printed in 1514 (in Paris)), Amlodhi has a great quern in the sea. The authors of Hamlet's Mill, however, interpret it as referring to the sky. Apart from 'cherry-picking' the myths they will deal with, the authors demonstrate they will make interpretations to suit their purpose. For de Santillana and von Dechend, the mill is an astronomical metaphor/code for the movement of the heavens around the world axis. (Evidenced in ancient mythology containing statements about knowledge of the changing frame of the earth's axis - the 'derangement of the heavens' - expressed in terms of cataclysmic flood mythology and zodiacal world ages.) The myth of the mill has commonality/parallels only amongst Indo-European peoples and originate from an ancient common source. (The Indo-European myth of the mill was explored in detail by 19th-century philologists and folklorists (and usually given a nature-myth explanation). As example, see: Curiosities of Indo-European Tradition and Folk-Lore (1863) by the historian Walter Kelly.) The authors of Hamlet's Mill concede there are no myths of mills amongst non Indo-European peoples. (Note: Finnish is a Uralic (Finno-Ugrian) language, not Indo-European.)
Victor Rydberg made the first interpretation of the mill under the sea being a cosmic mill making the constellations revolve/representing the
rotation of the celestial vault (see his Germanic Mythology, Volume 1, 1886). (See: Undersökningar i germanisk mythologi, första delen (1886), (Investigations into Germanic Mythology, Volume I), translated 1889. [Also termed Teutonic Mythology.]) The impossibility of this interpretation being valid should be obvious in the passage in Book Three of the Danish History of Saxo Grammaticus has: "As they passed the sand-dunes they told him [Amlodi] to look at this flour, to which he remarked that it had been ground by the foaming billows when it was stormy." (Sand and flour



are connected.) Hilda Davidson agrees with Cay Dollerup (1975) that the tale is referencing the extensive sand-dunes around the coast of Jutland. (See: Saxo Grammaticus: History of the Danes by Peter Fisher and Hilda Davidson (2 Volumes, 1979-1980, Volume 1, Page 88; Volume 2, Page 60.) The grinding of sand by the sea in the context of possibility of kenning versus riddle is also mentioned. The kenning "flour/meal of Amlodi," used of the sands of the sea ground by the mill of ocean (perhaps a great whirlpool) found in a verse by the 10th-century Icelandic poet Snæbjorn, and quoted by Snorri Sturlson in the Prose Edda (written in Iceland, early 13th-century). Snorri Sturlson states that the sea is called Amlodi's mill. Medieval traveller's tales told of a strange whirlpool near Norway. However, everything indicates it is merely a tale. A whirlpool, deemed the world's strongest whirlpool, does exist in Saltstraumen sound in Norway, located in Nordland, 30 kilometre east of the city of Bodø, in a narrow channel.
Parts of the material in Hamlet's Mill supposedly deals with apocalyptic speculation. The authors believed the maelstrom is an ancient symbol for the end of the world (and inevitably, the beginning of another).
A maelstrom (or malström/malstrøm in the Scandinavian languages) is a very powerful whirlpool. The Nordic word was introduced into English by Edgar Allan Poe in his 1841 story "A Descent into the Maelström." The Nordic word may have been borrowed from the Dutch maelstrom (modern spelling maalstroom, meaning literally 'crushing current' (or 'grinding current')). (Malström in Swedish is the combination of mala, to grind, and ström, meaning current.)
The Maelstrom (Moskstraumen) has been described by Edgar Alan Poe, Jules Verne, and Herman Melville, and a number of other writers (such as the Norwegian clergyman and poet Petter Dass) and historians. (The maelstrom was also incorporated by Jules Verne into the culmination of his 1869 novel, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.) In 1539, the Swedish geographer and historian Olaus Magnus (Olaf Mansson before his name was Latinized) published Carta Marina and included an illustration of a terrifying maelstrom. Later, in his 1555 book on the history of the Nordic people, he described the maelstrom as an ocean vortex that runs up and down the sea every day, devouring large ships and spewing them up again. In 1591 the district bailiff for the area of Lofoten wrote, " ... When the Maelstrom is at its peak, then you can see the sky and the sun through the waves and breakers, because they roll in as high as mountains."
The maelstrom located off the Lofoten Headlands/Lofoten Islands (Norway) is simply referred to as the Moskstraumen, and is the most famous/infamous. Moskstraumen is the 2nd strongest whirlpool in the world and is renowned as one of the world's strongest tidal currents in open waters. The Moskstraumen is thought to be the first mentioned maelstrom in history. It has been mentioned for approximately 1500 years with descriptions about seafarer's who met sea monsters and their doom in the treacherous whirlpool. Edgar Poe, like most other story tellers - grossly exaggerated the Moskstraumen. It is not a suction vortex. When tides fail to synchronise, differences in sea levels of almost 2 metres can occur. Currents of seawater rush towards each other through the channels, similar to rapids in a turbulent river. When they come into contact with seabed obstructions, such as shelves of rock, the water surges upward, bubbling and seething on the surface. The turbulence becomes even more violent in stormy weather, particularly if the winds are blowing against the flow of the stream. Maelstroms are dangerous to small boats because the currents are strong enough and rotate at a sharp enough angle that small boats can be capsized. At its height the Moskstraumen's forceful tidal currents produce powerful circular currents of water reaching speeds of almost 28 kilometres per hour (approximately 17 miles per hour), about 8 kilometres (5 miles) wide (with maelstroms up to 50 metres wide scattered across it), flowing along a deep marine channel between the Norwegian coast and the open sea. (The speed of the swirl of a whirlpool seldom exceeds 20 mph (32 kph).) Another description is: It flows between the island of Moskenesøya in the north, and some islets just north of the uninhabited island of Mosken in the south. The strait is about 4-5 kilometres across and 40-60 metres deep, and is considerably shallower than the surrounding sea. The tide fills up the Vestfjord twice a day, and the difference in height between high and low tides can be up to 4 metres. Midway between high and low tide, the current changes direction, and this is when the whirlpools begin to appear, with speeds of up to 11 kilometres per hour (and more).
Major whirlpools are usually located in narrow channels between 2 larger expanses of sea. The Maelstrom of Saltstraumen is the strongest maelstrom (the most dangerous maelstrom on the planet), and is located next to Norway. It is also not a suction vortex. (Positioned near the Arctic Circle.) Located in Nordland, 30 kilometres east of the city of Bodø, Norway in a narrow channel/strait - connecting the outer Saltfjord (Saltenfjord) with the large Skjerstadfjord - is the strongest tidal current on the globe. Up to 400 million m3 (tonnes) of seawater force their way through a 3 kilometre long and only 150 meter wide strait every 6 hours, with water speeds reaching 37 kilometres per hour. Vortices up to 10 metres in diameter and 5 metres deep at the eye of the vortex are formed when the current is at its strongest. Saltstraumen has existed for over two thousand years. Before that the area was geologically different due to the pressure from the glaciers that had covered Norway for tens of thousands of years. The current is created when the tide tries to fill the Skjerstad fjord. The height difference between the sea level and the fjord inside can be up to 1-1.5 metres and the speed of the current trying to even out that difference can be up to 40 kilometres per hour (25 miles per hour). When the current turns, there is a period ("time window") when the sound is navigable. During these times the currents appear almost calm and it is difficult to suspect that the site generates an enormously powerful maelstrom. (When the tidal currents turn, there is a "time window" when larger ships can sail through the sound.) However, the underwater currents are constantly churning, the water twisting, and locals and tourists are advised to use great caution when down by the sea or in a small boat.
Excursus: One of the first whirlpool legends to be recorded was that of Charybdis, a whirlpool in the strait of Messina between the Italian mainland and the island of Sicily. In Homer's Odyssey, written circa the 8th-century BCE, Charybdis is described as a sea monster sucking and belching forth water as it preys on passing ships.
It is not clear at all from the relevant verses how the Mill or its grist was peculiarly Hamlet's. The Mill is clearly a metaphor for the sea breaking against rocky islands or sandy shores and turning the rocks and stones into sand. The Mill was not Hamlet's at all but associated with the work of female sea spirits (and also giants).
On page 138 of Hamlet's Mill the authors attempt a connection between Dhruva as pole star circled without end by the starry sky like labouring corn mill oxen and the Latin Septentriones which they describe as the 7 threshing oxen of Ursa Major. They then write "that we are used to calling the Seven Oxen," according to Cicero's translation of Aratus. At least one Hamlet's Mill enthusiast has become confused and - without even looking at the Latin text of Cicero - has assumed they can assert "The seven threshing oxen of Ursa Major according to Cicero's translation of Aratus." This simply shortens a longer sentence on Page 138 of Hamlet's Mill. Nowhere is the etymology of Septentriones aided by Cicero to include threshing/milling. Nowhere does Cicero's Latin translation of Aratus' Phainomena include mention of threshing/milling in connection with the Septentriones. Further, it is not possible to make a connection between Cicero's Septemtriones and a cosmic mechanism making the celestial vault rotate. Cicero didn't write in English. Cicero used the old Latin name Septemtriones and Septemtrio with the epithet Major (to distinguish from the Small Bear constellation). For Cicero meaning 7 threshing oxen - and he elsewhere mentions threshing - can only be taken from Page 138 of Hamlet’s Mill. I prefer Latin-English dictionaries. It has been commented that Cicero's translation manipulated traditional astronomical knowledge. In Greek and Roman literature both Bear constellations (the most common name for both star groups) were also variously named as nymphs, wagons and oxen. The constellation names Great Bear and Little Bear are not used by the ancient Romans. (Also, the constellation/asterism Hyades is not mentioned by the ancient Romans.) Both the Bear constellations were instead called Septentriones (Seven Plough-oxen) by the Romans. The Great Bear was called Septentrione Major and the Little Bear was called Septentrione Minor. The ancient



Romans called the neighbouring constellation Boötes, the Oxherd. As an aside, the Mediterranean use of the name 'Wagon' as early as Homer perhaps originated from the Babylonian constellation name Wagon for the stars of the Great Bear. The 'septem triones' are 7 stars of the 'big dipper' asterism/constellation Big Bear and are 7 ploughing oxen. There are 9 giant maidens turning Hamlet's mill. Victor Rydberg made the first interpretation of the mill under the sea being a cosmic mill making the constellations revolve/representing the rotation of the celestial vault (see his Teutonic Mythology, Volume 1, 1886).
The magical mill of medieval Scandinavian folklore was the work-tool of chthonic deities (beings dwelling under the earth) - sea nymphs and giantesses. The content of the myth of Amlodhi's Mill ('World Mill') as given by the medieval Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus, explicitly states it is referring to the ocean. According to Saxo Grammaticus, Amlodhi has a great quern in the sea. In this myth about the Maelstrom it is said to have been created by magical millstones that rotated in the sea and made a deep hole into which water flowed. In actual fact the action of whirlpools is caused by the head-on crash of tidal flows, coupled with the uneven surface of the ocean floor. For the detailed demolition of the claim that the Mill of Scandinavian folklore is astronomical see: Amory, Frederic. (1977). "The Medieval Hamlet: A Lesson in the Use and Abuse of a Myth." (Deutsche Vierteljahresschrift für Literaturwissenschaft und Geistesgeschichte, Volume 51, Number 3, September, Pages 357-395). The author deals with numerous false or incorrect etymologies regarding Scandinavian mythology.
The introduction of the fully rotational quern
Source: Watts, Susan. (2014). "The symbolism of querns and millstones." (AmS-Skrifter [Arkeologisk Museum i Stavanger], Volume 24, Pages 5366; Pages 62-63).
The evidence suggests that fully rotational querns originated as late as circa 200 BCE. The place of origin is indicated as the Iberian peninsula. There is a possibility that rotary querns were introduced into Britain by circa 400 BCE, but most likely they were turned using an oscillatory motion rather than a fully rotational motion.
(8) The claim that "floods" are astronomical
Hamlet's Mill, Page 57 (A Guide for the Perplexed): "The "floods" refer to an old astronomical image." However, no conclusive or convincing case is made. One attempt is: From Deluge to Discourse: Myth, History, and the Generation of Chinese Tradition (1996) by Deborah Porter.
There has been a focus by some sinologists on the Mu/Yū flood myth tradition, which is included in most classical Chinese texts, as an example of precessional allegory. Mu/Yū, the son of Kun, succeeds in controlling the flood. The particular example of the fictional historical work Mu Tientzu chuan (purportedly a book on King Mu's (Yū's) tours to China's northwest borders) is: (1) from the literate period (the example is an early written text by an obviously sophisticated writer), (2) a sophisticated (post-Neolithic) astronomy was in existence, (3) there are sufficient astronomical indicators clearly in the story - even if the story is opaque, (4) this one example is attributable to one person who has no intention to propagate world-wide, and (5) the story is not specifically focused on precessional events. Guo Pu (276-324 CE), a natural historian, scholar, and also a versatile and prolific writer of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420 CE), is identified as the author of the Mu Tien-tzu chuan. However, a Warring States Period (circa 5th- to 3rd-century BCE) date of composition is thought likely by a number of sinologists. For Deborah Porter (From Deluge to Discourse (1996)) the story contains information that derives from precessional effects. For a detailed interpretation of the myths of Yū and his control of the great inundation of floodwaters as the observable workings of precession (a theme contained in the Mu Tien-tzu chuan) see, From Deluge to Discourse (1996) by Deborah Porter. This interpretation has also been made by the sinologists John Major and David Pankenier. King Mu/Yū was subject to two different legendary traditions in classical Chinese sources.
The Xia dynasty dates circa 2100/2070-1700/1600 BCE. (However, some scholars believe it could be legendary. See the brief expert discussion: "The Xia enigma" In: Ancient China: A History by John Major and Constance Cook (2017, Pages 60-61).) It is the first Chinese family of rulers described in the Chinese historical records (i.e., the Bamboo Annals, the Book of Documents (Classic of History), the Records of the Grand
Historian). Yū was the founder of the first civilized state, Xia. Yū is considered the first Xia dynasty emperor. Yū's greatest deed was stopping the world flood. In order to control the flood, Yū defeated and controlled numerous different monsters that brought disasters to humankind. A more mundane interpretation of the flood legends associated with Yū is the building projects of Yū protected China from frequent floods. One source states that Yū's major role as saviour of the world in the flood myth is rewritten so that his function is bureaucratized as the superintendent of Water Works.
From Deluge to Discourse: Myth, History, and the Generation of Chinese Tradition (1996) by Deborah Porter is a fascinating astronomical interpretation of aspects of early Chinese mythology based on a 'Hamlet's Mill approach' and greatly influenced by the ideas of the sinologist David Pankenier who also believes in a 'Hamlet's Mill approach' to Chinese and other mythology. The Mu Tianzi zhuan/Mu T'ien-tzu chuan account of King Mu's journey and the flood motif is, according the Deborah Porter, not a contemporary account, but rather is a fictional account that is dated by Deborah Porter to the 4th-century BCE (i.e., the Warring States period 481-221 BCE). The themes originated from precession making the seasonal function of a particular constellation obsolete (i.e., the noting of the shifting of the equinoxes to the then inexplicable effects of precession). It is postulated by some historians of astronomy that the Neolithic Chinese had knowledge of the tropical points (i.e., equinoxes and solstices). Porter is one of a number of sinologists and others who believe the Chinese were well aware of the effects of precession prior to its actual discovery in China. This conclusion is evident to them from some surviving records from the Han period and also the content of some particular mythology from this period.
A non astronomical - simply political - interpretation of flood myths connected with King Mu is set out by Mark Lewis in his 2006 book, The Flood Myths of Early China. It is a comprehensive study of Han period flood myths. Lewis explores how the flood myths of early China provided a template for that society's major social and political institutions. Lewis sets out a convincing case that the Chinese flood myths are a metaphor for establishing the legitimacy of terrestrial political authority - the terrestrial ruler and his authority, and social order established through the political institutions of the Warring States and Han period. The flood myths were aimed at achieving a unified polity in China with the new political order arising from the Warring Sates period. Articulated during the Warring States and Han periods (206 BCE-220 CE) the flood myths provided sanction for the political, social, and cultural institutions that promoted imperial unity. Yū's taming of the floods provided legitimacy for the centralised political institutions that were envisioned during the Warring States period and implemented during the Han period. I have not been able to identify any response by Deborah Porter or David Pankenier to the case set out in The Flood Myths of Early China.
An interesting study of the complexity of early Chinese stories is, Knowing Words: Wisdom and Cunning in the Classical Traditions of China and Greece by Lisa Raphals (1992).

Excursus: Deborah Porter
Porter, Deborah. (1996). From Deluge to Discourse: Myth, History, and the Generation of Chinese Tradition. [Note: A fascinating astronomical interpretation of aspects of early Chinese mythology based on a 'Hamlet's Mill approach.' According to Deborah Porter the Mu Tianzi zhuan/Mu T'ien-tzu chuan account of king Mu's journey and associated flood mythology is not a contemporary account but a fictional account that is dated to the 4th-century BCE (Warring States period 481-221 BCE). The flood mythology originates from precession making the seasonal function of a particular constellation obsolete. The flood mythology is an anxious response to the shifting of the equinoxes to the then inexplicable effects of precession. (The Chinese flood myth tales mostly centre on the earlier sage-king Yu. They are origin tales.) Marl Lewis, in his book, The Flood Myths of China (2006), also examines the Mu Tianzi zhuan/Mu T'ien-tzu chuan account of king Mu's journey and associated flood mythology and interprets the story in terms of political mythology. Deborah Porter is greatly influenced by the ideas of the sinologist David Pankenier who also believes in a 'Hamlet's Mill approach' to Chinese and other mythology. Deborah Porter is one of a number of sinologists and others who believe the Chinese were well aware of the effects of precession prior to its actual discovery in China. This conclusion is evident from some surviving records from the Han period and also the content of some particular mythology from this period. The earliest tentative awareness of precession in China took hold in the Hou Han (= later Han) period. (The later Han period is also now referred to as the Eastern Han Dynasty and spanned from 25 CE to 220 CE.) During this period it was quite widely recognised that the calendar altered (i.e., became unreliable) every 300 years. That is, every 300 years there was a requirement to use a new calendar. Multiple mentions of the fact that the calendar was only good for 300 years appears in the multiple volumes of the Hou Hanshu (= Book of the Later Han) by the historian Fan Ye (flourished 398-445 CE). The discovery of the precession of the equinoxes in China can be attributed to the scholar Yü Hsi (flourished circa 307-338 CE) circa 320 CE who discussed it in his book, the An Thien Lun written 336 CE. (The book discussed whether the motions of the heavens were stable.) Yü Hsi obtained a value of about 1 degree in 50 tropic years for the precessional movement. The brilliant scholar Zu Chongzi (420-500 CE) created the Daming Calendar (some sources say promoted his father's calendar ) which took precession into account for the first time. The most thorough and comprehensive calendar in the history of China was the Dayan Calendar compiled in the Tang Dynasty (616-907 CE) by the monk Yi Xing. Deborah Porter has a PhD (Princeton University, 1989); her doctoral dissertation was titled: The Style of Shui-hu chuan. She was Assistant Professor, Department of Foreign Languages and Literature, University of Utah, 1989-1996; Associate Professor, 1996-2002.

Part 7: The So-Called Precessional Numbers and Claim for Pre-Hipparchan Knowledge of Precession
The claim for precessional numbers in mythology
An argument for knowledge of precession is only achieved by "playing about" with numbers.
Some proponents of Hamlet's Mill have ignored the critical book reviews by offering the following type of argument: If someone was really going to kick out the props they would have targeted one of the more convincing aspects of the 'evidence': the mathematics of precession and its appearance in myths from widely different cultures i.e., the 'precessional numbers.' The 'trick' here is to assume (or believe) - without the felt need for any legitimate evidence as proof - that certain numbers in ancient myths are really 'precessional numbers.' The 18 numbers that are variously clamed to be 'precessional numbers' are obtained in different ways - and mostly have no direct connection with the so-called 'mathematics of precession.' They are simply the result of an exercise in number jumbling. The number 72 is the most promoted. The claim that 72 is a precessional number is an unproven assumption that some people like to believe. It has the illusion of being a strong argument. Supposedly, in ancient mythology, 72 = years for 1 degree of precessional movement - the number of years required for equinoctial sun to complete a precessional shift of 1 degree. Part of the problem created by this claim is there is no proof offered for a very early zodiac - and its measurement in degrees. Speculation is built upon speculation. Nothing at all exists that can be deemed convincing. The genesis of the number 72 as a precessional number is simply a fantasy reliant upon the dream that a zodiac of 12 equal divisions has existed since the Neolithic period.
In Hamlet's Mill (1969) the authors Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend, reference 2 works by the German philologist Franz Rolf Schröder, and invoke his ideas in a short quote from Altgermanische Kulturprobleme (1929). It is obvious they are influenced by Franz Schröder's ideas on numbers in world-wide mythology. His 2 books listed in the Bibliography are Altgermanische Kulturprobleme (1929), and Skadi und die Götter Skandinaviens (1941). Dr. Franz Rolf Schröder (1893-1979) was Privatdozent der deutschen und nordischen Philologie an der Universität Heidelberg. (One source states he was Professor in the University of Wutzburg.) He was a germanistischer und skandinavistischer Mediävist. In his book, Altgermanische Kulturprobleme [Problems of Ancient Germanic Culture] (1929, approximately 160 pages), Franz Schröder pointed out the presence of certain numbers that repeatedly appear in mythology world-wide. (See the unfavourable book review by Gustav Neckel, (from 1923 Professor of Old Germanic Studies at the University of Berlin), in DLZ [Deutsche Literaturzeitung], Band 50, Hefte 1, 1929, Pages 521-524. The issue had first been investigated around the turn of the 19th-century by the German star-myth school.
Not finding worldwide similarities in mythology and sacred numbers is to be regarded as an anomaly, and not the reverse. No one has yet shown that the number 72 is inherited from the Neolithic period, or is associated with a 12-sign equally divided pre-Babylonian zodiac.
It is important to note that ingenious numerical speculations with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 12, 40, 60, 70, and 72, derived mostly from astronomical occurrences, played a significant part in Panbabylonian speculations.
The fact is the Mesopotamians combined 10 with 6 to obtain a base figure of 60 - and they counted in multiples of 60.
Since the publication of Hamlet's Mill it is now common for a range of popular writers and pseudo-historians to claim that the principal precessional code numbers in mythology are:
12 (= number of constellations in the zodiac),
9 (= it is claimed that 9 is connected to the precession cycle, since the "precessional numbers" 72, 108, 216,432,and 25,920 are all divisible by 9).
18 (= ? [but is one quarter of 72]),
30 (= number of degrees allocated along the ecliptic to each zodiacal constellation),
36 (number of years required for equinoctial sun to complete precessional shift of 1⁄2 degree),



54 (= three-quarters of a degree of precession),
72 (= years for 1 degree of precessional movement - number of years required for equinoctial sun to complete a precessional shift of 1 degree),
360 (degrees; 12 multiplied by 30 degrees = 360 = total number of degrees in the ecliptic),
72 x 30 (= 2160 number of years required for sun to complete passage of 30 degrees along the ecliptic),
2160 x 12 (= 25,920 [also: 360 x 72] The Great Year or one complete precessional cycle) (but see above: The Claim for Precession in the ErraEpic),
4320 (= number of years required for equinoctial sun to complete precessional shift of 60 degrees (2 zodiacal constellations); also stated as 72 x 60 = 4320),
72 + 36 (precessional shift of 1⁄2 degree) (= 108),
108 x 100 (= 10,800) (72 + 36 = 108 x 10 = 10,800) (72 + 36 = 108 ÷ 2 = 54),
108 divided by 2 (= 54),
54 x 10 (= 540), and
432,000 (= 540 multiplied by 800; 2160 multiplied by 200 = Norse Myths: Valhalla's fighters = 432,000 - last battle against Fenrir Wolf (but see analysis below),
25,920 (= 72 multiplied by 360; also 12 by 2160 (precession movement through 1 zodiacal sign)); then use of these two numbers to derive 108, 216, 432, and 540,
25,920 divided by 60 (= 432),
and 10,800 (= 540 multiplied by 200 (sic); 2160 multiplied by 50 (sic)).
These numerological gymnastics recall the calculation antics of the pyramidiots. It is evidence that numbers can be played with to achieve any desired result.
The dominant/ruling precessional number is held/claimed to be 72. According to proponents of Hamlet's Mill the number 72 is the precessional number that is the foundation for various derivatives and multiples that occur in myths. Hamlet's Mill has an unidentified Neolithic culture establishing a 360 degree circle moving 1 degree every 71.6 years, but in encoding the number in mythology they round it to 72! (The rate of precession is not constant. (Precessional movement is irregular rather than constant.) A representative recent figure is 25720 years = 2143 years per 'zodiacal age' = 71.4 years per 1 degree. With 72 years for precession to move 1 degree = 2160 per 'zodiacal age' = 25920 years for the entire cycle to repeat. According to John Major Jenkins (http://edj.net/mc2012/mill1.htm) the traditional estimate of precession was 25920 years. In the writings of Joseph Campbell (which can be generally classed as 'alternative' literature) the mythical 540 gates of Valhalla are interpreted as one quarter of 2160 (= one twelfth of the precession period (of 25920 years). The question is: If we accept ancient knowledge of precession then is this a real or rounded/ideal figure? Interestingly, David Ulansey in his precessional interpretation of the religion of Mithras (The Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries (1989)) uses the annual precessional rate of 50.3 seconds of arc per year = 1 degree every 71.6 years = so-called 'precessional great year' of 25,700 years.) As Jason Colavito has pointed out in his 27/11/2012 website article "Civilization and Precession (Part 1"): "[T]he numbers ... identified in myth have a much simpler explanation: they are all multiples of 2 and 3, the smallest numbers capable of generating complex multiples. ... Early peoples who did not use a decimal system, tended to use multiples of 2 and 3 because these were the easiest numbers for generating large multiples." For an interesting discussion of the origin of sacred numbers see the brief article: "The Origin of Sacred Numbers." by Daniel Brinton (The American Anthropologist, Volume VII, Number 2, April, 1894, Pages 168-173). One of his conclusions is the sacred numbers are preeminently 3 and 4, or derived from these i.e., derived from 3 are the numbers 9 and 33; derived from 4 are the numbers 7 and 13. The 'holy numbers' of the Rig-Veda are 3 and 7. See the discussion: "The Holy Numbers of the Rig-Veda." by Edward Hopkins (Oriental Studies, A Selection of Papers Read Before the Oriental Club of Philadelphia 1888-1894, 1894, Pages 141-159). A point also made by the author is that the sacredness of the number 7 is comparatively modern. It is interesting that the authors of Hamlet's Mill assume, but do not discuss, the antiquity of their precessional numbers.
So-called "precessional numbers" have affinities with what Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920, Indian mahematician) termed "highly composite numbers." A highly composite number (HCN) is a positive integer with more divisors than any smaller positive integer has. (The term was coined in 1915 by Srinivasa Ramanujan who investigated such numbers.) Example: The number 24 has 8 divisors. No smaller number has that many divisors, so 24 is a highly composite number. Jean-Pierre Kahane has suggested that the concept can be traced back to Plato, who set 5040 as the ideal number of citizens in a city because 5040 has more divisors than smaller numbers. (See: Kahane, Jean-Pierre., "Bernoulli convolutions and self-similar measures after Erdős: A personal hors d'øeuvre." in Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, Volume 62, Number 2, February 2015, Pages 136–140. Kahane cites Plato's Laws, 771c.) There are an infinite number of highly composite numbers, and the first few are 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, 720, 840, 1260, 1680, 2520, 5040, .... The corresponding numbers of divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 30, 32, .... The presence of 12 and its multiples (and the absence of 10) demonstrates how useful such numbers are even within a culture using a decimal system. There are strong reasons why 12, 24, 30, and 360 have such resilient uses. 360 is divisible by 24 different numbers, which is important in dividing 360 into smaller integer parts. 365 is divisible by only 2 numbers, 73 and 5. Here we have a strong reason to round the year to 360 to a first approximation. There are 12-and-a-bit lunations per year, so again there is a strong reason to round (and simplify) the number to 12 months in the year, each of 30 days, and then intercalate 5 epagomenal days to correct the calendar.
A point worth making is the Babylonian system of degrees left no trace in ancient Egypt. There was no use of a system of degrees in ancient Egypt to measure celestial arcs. The use of such was introduced during the Hellenistic period.
The question that needs answering is: Why should any of these numbers be teamed together and transformed in the way chosen by proponents of pre-Hipparchan knowledge of precession? Why are these particular calculations (mathematical gymnastics) – usually involving addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction engaged in. Simply, why are the numbers and processes chosen and used (i.e., how and why), and why are they to be taken as evidence of pre-Hipparchan knowledge of precession? What other more tangible, historical evidence exists for establishing preHipparchan knowledge of precession? Proponents do not seem to know, or care to explain any of these questions. I cannot find any example where this request is actually met. The process of mathematical gymnastics engaged in readily invites the criticisms that it is a subjective exercise and



also that it involves filtering and shaping. I remain underwhelmed by the whole exercise. It is perhaps likely that some people at least are working backwards from the answer they want to achieve as a way of choosing numbers and processes to achieve the outcome.
In his book, The Myth of Invariance, McClain demonstrates that the various sexagesimal/precessional numbers were as uniquely and specially fitted to acoustical arithmetic as to precessional arithmetic. In effect he adapts the structure of the Hamlet's Mill argument from a presumed astronomical to a likely musical context. The numbers involved in McClain's musical arithmetic include: 30, 60, 216, 360, 432, etc; 12 multiplied by 360 = 4,320; 40 multiplied by 432 = 12,960, etc. Two numbers important to Plato, a Pythagorean, in his The Republic (viii, 546, B-D) are 216, and 12,960,000. In his book review, Fred Fisher (North Texas State University) identifies that McClain's debt to Giorgio de Santillana is apparent at many points, but nowhere more than in his derivation of the title itself. Invariance began as a musico-acoustical idea.
In May 2001 the following comment was posted on Hastro-L: "If someone was really going to kick out the props they would have targeted one of the more convincing aspects of the 'evidence': the mathematics of precession and its appearance in myths from widely differing cultures ie (sic) the precessional 'number'." Unrealised by the person posting are his multiple assumptions: (1) the ecliptic was known thousands of years prior to its identification by the Babylonians, (2) the tropical points were identified and accurately established thousand of years prior to the Greeks, (3) precession was known thousands of years prior to Hipparchus, and (4) the so-called "precessional numbers" numbers are indeed related to precession. Also necessarily assumed as an integral requirement are: (5) an equally divided 12-division zodiac thousands of years prior to its known invention in late 1st-millennium Babylon, and (6) the use of a 360o system (or equivalent) for measuring/'marking' along the ecliptic. None of these 6 points have been established by proponents. Speculative assertions are not evidentiary 'props.' Proponents of Hamlet's Mill need need to establish a realistic understanding of what constitutes evidence and where the onus stands for provision of proof.
Regarding the Number 432,000
Berossos made the first explicit astronomical calculation for the 'end of days.'The figure of 432,000 years is correctly derived from the revolutions of Jupiter and Saturn
(1) Berossos: According to Berossos, a Babylonian priest of Bel, the Babylonians also had a Great Year. Berossos wrote of a 'cosmic year' of 432,000 years. (The figure of 432,000 years is derived from the revolutions of Jupiter and Saturn (the first explicit 'end of days' astronomical calculation) - 432,000 years corresponds to both 36,000 cycles of Jupiter and 14,400 cycles of Saturn.) Circa 280 BCE, when residing on the Greek island of Cos, Berossos wrote a work titled Babyloniaca (now only known from fragments mentioned by other Greek authors). In the 2nd volume Berossos interpreted the 432,000 years of the period before the great flood - when 10 kings had ruled in Mesopotamia for that period - as a Great Year comprised of 12 months, each month comprising 36,000 years. Berossos wrote that the work of creating the world carried within its structure repetitively recurring celestial cycles of destruction and recurrence. According to the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca the Younger (4 BCE-65 CE) (Quaestiones naturales [Questions about science] 3.29 ), Berossos has the deluge occurring when all the planets are in the zodiacal sign of Capricorn and that the world conflagration begins when all the planets are in the zodiacal sign of Cancer.
Identifying Babylonian sources before Berossos is problematic. Despite the common opinion that the idea of a Great Year originated in Babylonia, there is no clear and unambiguous evidence of a Babylonian expectation of an end of the world in any form before Berossos. No Babylonian sources are known for the 432,000 years Berossos gives for the period before the flood.
(2) A Babylonian Great Year?: The whole doctrine of 'cosmic recurrence' is thought to be of Babylonian origin. (There were no early Sumerian/Akkadian beliefs in a Great Year.) It is thought the Great Year of the Classical world arose from the mythical conception of a cosmic periodicity the origin of which is ultimately traceable to Babylonia. In his Science Awakening II: The Birth of Astronomy (1974) the mathematician Bartel L. van der Waerden wrote (page 113): "we may suppose that the whole doctrine of 'cosmic recurrence' is of Babylonian origin." There is some evidence (not unambiguous) that the Babylonians conceived the doctrine of the Great Year.
When the Greeks formulated the duration of the cycles of the Great Year they usually had large multiples of 360 in the calculation. The number 360 is recognisable as the number of degrees in a circle. This is considered to be a Babylonian 'signature.' If Berossos is reliable then 36,000 was the duration of a Babylonian cycle. However, neither the numbers 432,000 or 36,000 appear in Babylonian texts. There is no explicit reason for believing the Babylonians developed the notion of a repetitive cosmic Great Year; a belief that immense cycles of time culminated in huge catastrophes and recurrence of creation. As the Babylonians were not familiar with precession any concept of a Great Year they may have had would not have been estimated with reference to precession. Any concept of a Babylonian Great Year would likely be connected with planetary conjunctions or the lengths of reign of legendary kings.
Ancient belief in the power of numbers
Central to the use of numbers within magic and occult practices was the ancient belief that numbers, by themselves, had power to influence the corporeal world. This concept is of course rejected by the modern scientific community. However, conditions in the ancient world made the motivation to believe in the power of numbers very strong. In early times most natural phenomena could only be explained as the action of the gods/goddesses. Farmers realised that the seasons changed, and these changes were reflected in the different locations of star groups in the sky. As a result, they saw the connection between seasons, the production of their food, and the stars. Since the stars moved and the seasons changed, it was easy to believe the stars somehow caused the changes here on earth. Any person who recorded past seasons and star positions had information to predict the coming seasons. As a result, numbers used to record the dates of past events, became the connection between earthly matters and the stars. This suggested to the ancients that a causal connection existed between numbers and worldly occurrences. The Pythagoreans of the Greek world elevated the importance of numbers to new heights. Because of the supposed connection between such objects as stars, numbers, and their daily lives, the Pythagoreans evolved a metaphysics based on number which was also connected to other, non-numerical attributes.
The myth of knowledge of precession in ancient India
E[?]. Burgess (Translation of the Suryasiddhanta: A Textbook of the Hindu Astronomy with Notes and an Appendix (1977, Pages 115–120)),
claims that knowledge of precession was known to astronomers in India since the Vedic period (circa 2000 BCE/1500 BCE - 1000 BCE). David Pingree ("Precession and Trepidation in Indian Astronomy Before A.D. 1200." (Journal for the History of Astronomy, Volume 3, 1972, Pages 2735)) states the earliest datable reference to precession/trepidation in India is the Pãncasiddhāntikā by the 6th-century CE Indian philosopher, astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician Varāhamihira (505-587 CE). It was not until the 12th-century CE that precession was estimated to within an accuracy of 1 percent in India.
The churning of the Sea of Milk described in the Mahabharata and Ramayana
Regarding the churning of the Sea of Milk illustrated on a wall at the 12th-century CE Cambodian temple complex at Angkor Wat. De Santillana/von Dechend write: "The whole of Angkor thus turns out to be a colossal model set up for "alternative motion" with true Hindu fantasy



and incongruousness to counter the idea of a continuous one-way Precession from west to east." (Hamlet's Mill, 1969, Page 163.) This attempt to connect the churning of the Sea of Milk with precession is simply speculation. In the ancient Hindu myth of the Churning of the Milky Ocean the essential components of the world emerge from the archaic waters. The Mahabharata, a 2000 year old Hindu epic, and other sacred Hindu texts, relate how the Sun and Moon were, in another age, churned like butter out of the primordial ocean by the cooperative effort of the gods and demons. Also the amrita, the magical beverage of of immortality. The churn to butter the ocean was comprised of Mount Mandara (to be twisted like a churn) and Vasaki, the colossal Serpent King (to be used as the cham cord). With the gods gripping the tail of the great snake and the demons alternately pulling on the neck the mountain swiveled. The god Vishnu as tortoise submerged and positioned himself between the base of the mountain and the floor of the ocean. Gradually the ocean's waters churned to milk. The story has nothing to do with precession. The authors do make any case that it does.
Dhruva does not provide evidence of knowledge of precession in India
In the Bhagavata Purana (the god) Dhruva is identified as the Pole Star. It is somewhat usual to identify Dhruva (the Pole Star) with α (alpha) Draconis (Thuban, a pale yellow star) but it could have been perhaps the dim star Ketu (Kappa Draconis, or even α (alpha) Ursa Minor (Polaris). It is perhaps more likely that in the Bhagavata Purana the identification of Dhruva as the Pole Star meant α (alpha) Ursa Minor (Polaris). Dennis Hudson (at circa 2004), Emeritus Professor of Religion, Smith College (USA) is an expert on the Bhagavata Purana. From his research he has concluded that the Bhagavata Purana is a composite work which originated in different places at different periods. He dates its composition over a time span of 1600 years from circa 700 BCE to circa 900 CE. This dating does not give support for the recognition of Thuban as Pole Star. (It appears the Bhagavata Purana remained an oral tradition until written down circa 800 CE.) Also, Hudson's dating and the statement that no one had previously lived in Dhruva's place in the sky seems to support no knowledge of Thuban as a previous pole star.
Hermann Jacobi ("On the Antiquity of Vedic Culture." (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, Pages 721-726)) noted that the Gryha Sutras mention Dhruva as the Pole Star and also that the Maitrayana Brahamana Upanishad states that even the polestar moves (over a long period of time). Jacobi 's argument that these instances preserve memories from ancient times is not supported by mainstream scholarship. (Hermann Jacobi's claim at the time it was proposed was opposed by William Whitney, A[?]. Keith, and others.) The chronology of Indian history and literature prior to the Middle Ages is notoriously uncertain and astro-archaeological methods arguing for very early dates are generally rejected by mainstream scholarship.
The 7 Rsis were associated with the centre of the sky i.e., the region of the north celestial pole. However, Dhruva (the Pole Star) came to assume this position when precession slightly shifted the location of Ursa Major.
If precession was common knowledge amongst 'intellectual elites' in the Neolithic period, due to diffusion from an original source in the Near East, then it is puzzling that in Hindi mythology the name Dhruva (immovable) is used to denote an astral god, identified with a star in the constellation of Ursa Minor which was the pole star in the last millennium BCE..
The myth of knowledge of precession in ancient Egypt
Any claim for Egyptian knowledge of precession in the 2nd-millennium BCE is usually reliant on bull and ram imagery in Egyptian iconography. However, Egyptian astronomy shows no evidence of zodiac until the Ptolemaic era. The starry bull of the Egyptians was the Big Dipper, not Taurus. The existence of an Egyptian Aries is also problematic. Prior to the Ptolemaic era the Egyptian lion constellation was probably not Leo. Due to the diffusion of Hellenistic tradition the Dendera Zodiac relief, which includes Leo, also shows the indigenous Egyptian lion was located in the northern sky (as indicated by the New Kingdom tombs), not on the ecliptic. Contrary claims by pseudohistorians such as Sitchen/Hancock cannot change what are well established facts.
The principal source for the claim that the ancient Egyptians were aware of precession is the book, The Death of Gods in Egypt by Jane Sellers (1992; 2nd revised edition 2003, 3rd revised edition 2007). Jane B. Sellers, who is not a professional Egyptologist, was born in Chicago(?) in 1926. She uses Egyptian mythology to test the ideas in Hamlet's Mill. Sellers set out to find evidence of precessional mythology in Egypt because she thought the topic was neglected in Hamlet's Mill. Two criticisms are: (1) She looked at the evidence selectively. (2) She 'force fits' evidence to the theory. (3) She used a lot of material that was 20 plus years out of date when doing her work. Jane Sellers "gained her BA late in life, at Goddard College, Vermont, and went on to study Egyptology at the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute." For reasons unrelated to the course the author did not complete her Ph.D. in Egyptology (under Dr. Klaus Baer) at the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago. Juan Villar, in his book The Seventh Wonder (2005), incorrectly/falsely identifies Jane Sellers as an Egyptologist at the University of Chicago, and thus associates her book with the University of Chicago. A revised and updated 2nd edition of her book was first privately published (unbound, i.e., loose sheet form) by the author in 1999 and then published as a bound volume by a minor publisher in 2003 (and this later 2nd edition is the preferred volume to use). She was "Author of the Month" for November 2003 at grahamhancock.com. The popular pseudo-historian Graham Hancock deems Sellers to be an "archaeo-astronomer." Sellers believes the death of Osiris in Egyptian mythology was a precessional death. Elements of the Osiris myth are found in the Pyramid Texts dating to circa 2450 BCE, but Sellers uses the Osiris myth from The Egyptian Myth of the Dead [The Egyptian Book of the Dead] dated circa 1550 BCE. According to Sellers the Osiris myth was encoded with a group of key (precessional) numbers: 360, 72, 30, and 12 (and 5). Sellers claims that these numbers are equated with the precession of the equinoxes. According to Sellers the most important number in the "code" is 72. That the true figure for the rate of precession (measured in degrees) is 71.6 years is glossed over as being too difficult to insert into the narrative structure i.e., you can't have 71.6 persons.
The explanation (not explicit in The Egyptian Myth of the Dead) of the so-called precessional numbers according to Sellers:
12 = the number of zodiacal constellations.
30 = the number of degrees of one "age" in the precessional cycle (= 2160 years) / the number of degrees allocated along the ecliptic to each zodiacal constellation.
72 = the number of years for the sun to complete a precessional shift of 1 degree along the ecliptic.
360 = the number of degrees completing the precessional cycle (= 25,920 years) / the number of degrees comprising the entire ecliptic of 12 zodiacal constellations.
5 = used as a multiplier number.
We then get the usual assumption of multiplying the following combination of numbers: 72 x 30 = 2160; 12 x 2160 = 25,920; 5 x 72 = 360; 72 x 360 = 25,920.



However, in the Osiris myth, the god Set (the brother of Osiris) conspired with Aso (an Ethiopian queen) and 72 other accomplices to enclose Osiris in a coffin. This totals 74, not 72. The number 72 is separated out in order to assign it precessional significance. Also, a non precessional use of 72 is: Thoth, in an Egyptian creation myth, wins a 72nd of each day of the year from the Moon in a game of draughts, as a favour to Nut, the Sky Goddess. He uses these portions to make the five intercalary days on which the remaining Gods and Goddesses are born. In Egypt the use of the number 72 had application to the number of people, and the number of days. The number 72 was popular in Greece and Egypt during the Hellenistic period. (For a detailed discussion of the number 72 during the Hellenistic period see especially: The Meaning of the Letter of Aristeas by Ekaterina Matusova (2015).)
The recognition of precession in China
The earliest archaeological evidence of a Chinese calendar appears on the oracle bones of the late 2nd-millennium BCE. They demonstrate a 12month lunisolar year with the occasional arbitrary intercalation of a 13th- and even 14th-month. However, Chinese historical records place the origin of a lunisolar calendar (of 366 days) to circa 3000 BCE. The development of a calendar in China was closely related to the development of astronomy and the needs of agriculture. (China was largely an agricultural society.)
The earliest tentative awareness of precession in China took hold in the Hou Han (= later Han) period. (The later Han period is also now referred to as the Eastern Han Dynasty and spanned from 25 to 220 CE.) During this period it was quite widely recognised that the calendar altered (i.e., became unreliable) every 300 years. That is, every 300 years there was a requirement to use a new calendar. Multiple mentions of the fact that the calendar was only good for 300 years appears in the multiple volumes of the Hou Hanshu (= Book of the Later Han) by the historian Fan Ye (flourished 398-445 CE).
According to the sinologist Nathan Sivin (Granting the Seasons (2009, Page 100)): "... for the Chinese the initial point of the year was the winter solstice. ... The conception [of precession] evolved in several steps. Beginning at the end of the first century B.C., astronomers became aware that in observations over long periods the winter solstice point appeared at different locations among the stars. They were not certain, however, whether this was a gradual shift or the result of earlier observational errors."
The discovery of precession - or at least the hunch of its existence - is attributed by Wolfram Eberhard and Rolf Mueller to the Palace astronomer Chia K'uei (30-101 CE) of the Han dynasty. The date they give for his suspicion is circa 89 CE. (See: "Contributions to the Astronomy of the Han Period III: Astronomy of the Later Han Period." by Wolfram Eberhard and Rolf Mueller in Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, Volume 1, Number 2, July, 1936, Pages 194-241.)
The discovery of the precession of the equinoxes in China can be attributed to the scholar Yü Hsi (flourished circa 307-338 CE) circa 320 CE who discussed it in his book, the An Thien Lun written 336 CE. (The book discussed whether the motions of the heavens were stable.) Yü Hsi (281356) obtained a value of about 1 degree in 50 tropic years for the precessional movement. (This is off by almost 50 percent.)
The brilliant scholar Zu Chongzi (420-500 CE) created the Daming Calendar (some sources say promoted his father's calendar ) which took precession into account for the first time. The most thorough and comprehensive calendar in the history of China was the Dayan Calendar compiled in the Tang Dynasty (616-907 CE) by the monk Yi Xing.
Written Chinese astronomical texts first appear in the Shang Dynasty (circa 17/1600-11/1050 BCE) with the oracle bone divinations. Considerable early Chinese mythology carries sufficient hints to invite an astronomical interpretation. There is the myth of the quarrelling brothers: the legend of E Bo (Ebo) and Shi Chen (Shichen), preserved in the Zuo Commentary. It has astrological content dating to the 2nd-millennium BCE. However, there is no reason to interpret a precessional coding within the astronomical content. Also, there is the myth of the Weaver Woman/Girl (Zhi Nu) and Oxherd (Niulang). It was well established and popular during the upheavals of the Period of Disunity (circa 220-590 CE), between the collapse of the Han Dynasty and the establishment of the T'ang Dynasty. The earliest model for the weaving woman is found in the Classic of Poetry (circa 600 BCE, but a collection of verses from roughly 1000 BCE to 600 BCE) which briefly relates the myth of the stellar goddess Weaver Woman (Chih Nü). (See: Games Poets Play: Readings in Medieval Chinese Poetry by Anne Birrell (2004, Page 148).)
The Herd-Boy and the Weaver Girl: There are numerous versions of the story, which dates back to the 6th-century BCE and is found in the first known book of Chinese poetry, The Book of Songs). Brief synopsis: Altair (in our Western constellation Aquila) and Vega (the brightest star in our Western constellation Lyra) figure prominently in the ancient Chinese legend of the Herd-Boy (tending his buffalo or oxen) and Weaver-Girl. The Herd-Boy is particularly love-struck by the youngest Weaver-Girl. In the sky, Altair is the Herd-Boy (Cow-Herd) and Vega the Weaver-Girl. The Milky Way is the heavenly river separating the lovers. They cannot swim this river. However, due to Weaver-Girl's grandmother, a queen of heaven, they are able to share 3 years of wedded bliss in heaven before being separated again by the heavenly river. Depending on the version of the story, either the two stars on either side of Altair or the stars in Lyra near Vega represent their children. Other nearby stars are messages the lovers have sent to each other. The story is at least as old as the 6th-century BCE, when it appeared in an anthology called Shih Ching (Book of Songs) ( possibly compiled by Confucius). This work was ordered destroyed a few hundred years later by the emperor, Shih Huang Ti. It is proposed by some scholars (i.e., Deborah Porter) that the tale of the Herd-Boy (Cowherd) and the Weaver-Girl may have been included in a broader set of astral myths.
Other Chinese astral myths: Chang E, or The Archer and the Moon Goddess; Legend of the Twelve Zodiac Animals.
The Hamlet's Mill 'benchmark' is that pre-literate complex myth(s), containing no obvious astronomical indicators, formed a technical language that enabled world-wide transmission of precessional and other astronomical knowledge (i.e., an equally divided 12-constellation zodiac). A complex monomyth was constructed to contain and structure the information to enable its assembly and propagation. Chinese examples of astronomical mythology are somewhat scarce and do not meet the Hamlet's Mill 'benchmark.' There has been a focus by some sinologists on the Mu/Yū flood myth tradition, which is included in most classical Chinese texts, as an example of precessional allegory. Mu/Yū, the son of Kun, succeeds in controlling the flood. The particular example of the fictional historical work Mu Tien-tzu chuan (purportedly a book on King Mu's (Yū's) tours to China's northwest borders) is: (1) from the literate period having a developed astronomy (the example is an early written text by an obviously sophisticated writer), (2) a sophisticated (post-Neolithic) astronomy was in existence, (3) there are sufficient astronomical indicators clearly in the story - even if the story is opaque, (4) this one example is attributable to one person who has no intention to propagate world-wide, and (5) the story is not specifically focused on precessional events in any obvious way. There is no match with the theme/thesis of Hamlet's Mill. Guo Pu (276-324 CE), a natural historian, scholar, and also a versatile and prolific writer of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420 CE), is identified as the author of the Mu Tien-tzu chuan. However, a Warring States Period (circa 5th- to 3rd-century BCE) date of composition is thought likely by a number of sinologists. For Deborah Porter (From Deluge to Discourse (1996)) the story contains information that derives from precessional effects. In doing so she connects it with the "Yu-kung" ("Yu gong") section of the Book of Documents (Shujing or Shangshu) or Classic of History, containing the early Yū myths concerning Yū's control of the floodwaters. The Book of Documents also known as the Shangshu, is one of the Five Classics of ancient Chinese literature. The "Yu-kung" section consists largely of a geographical description of China in the time of the Emperor



Yū. For a detailed interpretation of the myths of Yū and his control of the great inundation of floodwaters as the observable workings of precession (a theme contained in the Mu Tien-tzu chuan) see, From Deluge to Discourse (1996) by Deborah Porter. This interpretation has also been made by the sinologists John Major and David Pankenier. King Mu/Yū was subject to two different legendary traditions in classical Chinese sources.
Interestingly, the renowned sinologist Edward Schafer (1913-1991) (Agassiz Professor of Oriental Languages at the University of California, Berkeley) wrote (Pacing the Void: T'ang Approaches to the Stars (1977, Page 315): "Santillana and Dechend, 1969, 177, referring chiefly to western star lore, write: "... the constellations were seen as the setting, or the dominating influences or even only the garments at the appointed time by the Powers in various disguises on their way through their heavenly adventures." Assuming that this characterization is a reasonable one, it is not entirely applicable to the Chinese stellar hierarchy, which was far from being an adventurous one."

King Yū and the great flood, and the Xia dynasty
Note: My original notes for Yū and the food water theme have yet to be located. They comprise a more detailed study of why the story is not astronomical/precessional.
King Yū, legend or historical figure
Yū the Great (circa 2200 – 2101 BCE) was a legendary/historical ruler in ancient China famed for his introduction of flood control, inaugurating dynastic rule in China by founding the Xia Dynasty, and for his upright moral character.
As the story goes, a great flood inundated the valley of the Huanghe (Yellow ) River. It covered even the hills, so that the people were unable to get food. King Shun ordered the official Yū to control it. Yū organized the princes who ruled various localities and the people in them to cut channels and build other projects to drain the waters away to the sea. He worked for 13 years before bringing the flood under control.
It is generally considered that legends about the labours of Yū, the the sage-emperor and founder of the Xia dynasty, who reputedly drained away the flood waters and made the north China plain habitable, preserves memory of earlier inundations. Yū The Great, the best loved and best known of several legendary rulers, is now considered to have been an actual person, the first King of the Xia dynasty (circa 21st-16th centuries BCE), Perhaps many incidents in man's dim memory of battle against flood have collected around his figure to form the legend. The first written account of the story of Yū appears in The Book of History ["Tribute of Yū" ("Yū gong") chapter of the Book of Documents], which is made up of a number of ancient pieces supposedly collected and edited by Confucius in the 4th-century BCE.
The dates proposed for Yū's reign predate the oldest known written records in China, the oracle bones of the late Shang dynasty, by nearly a millennium. No inscriptions on artifacts from the proposed era of Yū, nor the later oracle bones, make any mention of Yū; he does not appear in inscriptions until vessels dating to the Western Zhou period (circa 1045–771 BCE). The lack of anything remotely close to contemporary documentary evidence has led to some controversy over the historicity of Yū. Proponents of the historicity of Yū theorise that stories about his life and reign were transmitted orally in various areas of China until they were recorded in the Zhou dynasty, while opponents believe the figure existed in legend in a different form - as a god or mythical animal - in the Xia dynasty, and morphed into a human figure by the start of the Zhou dynasty. Many of the stories about Yū were collected in Sima Qian's famous Records of the Grand Historian. Yū and other "sage-kings" of Ancient China were lauded for their virtues and morals by Confucius and other Chinese teachers.
Archaeological evidence for the "Great Flood."
Archaeological data indicates that Xia was a river valley civilisation, situated in the Yihe and Luohe river valleys along the Yinge and Ruhe rivers. The capital city of Xia was located in the Sangshan mountains along the southern bank of the Yellow River. (In the 1980s, Chinese archaeologists discovered buildings and bronze remains at Erlitou/Erlitu village, on the northern bank of the Luohe River, in western Henan Province that were carbon dated to circa 1900 BCE. (The Erlitou/Erlitu Ruins were found in 1959 by the historian Xu Xusheng.) The Erlitou/Erlitu culture (= Xia culture) was an early Bronze Age urban society and archaeological culture that existed in the Yellow River valley from circa 1750 BCE to 1530 BCE (dating varies). The Bronze Age 'Erlitou culture' is now considered most likely an archaeological manifestation of the Xia dynasty. Many scholars believe the settlement, which may have had a population of 30,000 (the largest living community in China and also in East Asia in the first half of circa 2000 BCE), was likely the ancient capital city of Xia. The site of Erlitou/Erlitu belongs to the later period of the Xia Dynasty and circa 1600 BCE became the capital of the Shang dynasty when it replaced the Xia dynasty. Three large-scale separate palace sites/complexes have been identified at Erlitou/Erlitu.) Chinese histories record that the Xia had writing and tortoise (shell) books. The Xia dynasty dates circa 2100/2070-1700/1600 BCE. It is the first Chinese family of rulers described in the Chinese historical records (i.e., the Bamboo Annals (Annals of the Bamboo Books), the Classic of History, the Records of the Grand Historian). Yū was the founder of the first civilized state, Xia. Yū is considered the first Xia dynasty emperor. Yū's greatest deed was stopping the world flood. In order to control the flood, Yū defeated and controlled numerous different monsters that brought disasters to humankind. A more mundane interpretation of the flood legends associated with Yū is the building projects of Yū protected China from frequent floods. One source states that Yū's major role as saviour of the world in the flood myth is rewritten so that his function is bureaucratized as the superintendent of Water Works.
Great floods occupy a central place in some of the world's oldest stories. Perhaps the most famous Chinese tale is "Great Yū Controls the Waters." Historical texts from circa 1000 BCE first mention a legendary Xia ruler, Yū. According to the legend, Chinese civilisation began circa 2,000 BCE in the Yellow River basin, when king Yu (Emperor Yu the Great) (when an official appointed to the task by king Shun) successfully managed to control a huge flood (when the Yellow River burst it banks and inundated the valley of the Yellow River). The tale relates a great flood at the dawn of Chinese civilization was said to have swept away settlements, the water rising so high that it overran hills, mountains and also heaven. The detail that the flood was large enough to "assail the heavens" indicates that it was raging through the region before Yū devised a method to dredge and channel the flooded rivers to control the water - a task that apparently took decades (and the help of dragons and a giant turtle to accomplish). It is stated he worked for 13 years before bringing the flood under control. Yū devised a system of dredges to control a great flood that spanned generations. He was said to have been based around Jishi Gorge. The tale relates that King Yū of the Xia Dynasty, instead of trying to stop up the water behind dams (containing the water with dikes instead of draining) the way his predecessors had done, built irrigation channels and dredged riverbeds. He sacrificed his body for the project, accumulating calluses as he toiled alongside the common laborers. (In reality he would have organised the princes who ruled the various locations and the people in them to build projects to drain the flood water away to the sea.) He left his family for years to see the task accomplished, and ultimately separated water from land, pulled order from chaos. According to the tale his efforts and ability to combat natural disasters earned him a heavenly mandate to rule. He lay the foundation for China's first dynasty, the Xia, and began a political system that would endure as a model for generations of subsequent Chinese rulers. Without evidence of a great flood occurring during the



era Yū is dated to - or that he actually existed - scholars have viewed Yū and his irrigation system as a myth to build an empire (or religion) upon. However, in early August 2016 Chinese archaeologists and geologists announced they had found evidence of a "mythical" great flood along the Yellow River in China. The occurrence of the flood is dated circa 2000 BCE. The location and time matches the recorded tale of Yū in the various records written hundreds of years later.
There is now geological evidence that China's legendary 'great flood' - as big as the legend suggests - might have actually occurred, and help start a civilisation. A team of international researchers led by Wu Qianlong, a former Peking University seismologist published the outcome of their study (early August 2016) in the journal Science that they found evidence that a flood submerged a vast swath of the country almost 4,000 years ago. Using radiocarbon dating of juvenile bones and soil samples along the Yellow River, the research team established that an earthquake triggered a huge landslide, damming the waterway in 1920 BCE. The researchers deduced that for six to nine months about 15 trillion litres (4 trillion gallons) of water built up behind a wall of rock and dirt near Jishi Gorge in what is present-day Qinghai Province. When the dam broke (perhaps triggered by another earthquake), the water and debris tore through the gorge at 500 times the Yellow River's average discharge and submerged the North China Plain that is considered the cradle of Chinese civilization. It was one of the largest freshwater floods in human history. According to modelling projections, the flood water would have risen around 38 metres (124 feet) above normal river level, with flood rates of up to 500,000 cubic metres (132 million gallons) per second. According to one of the researchers, David Cohen from National Taiwan University, its equivalent to the largest flood registered on the Amazon River, and the largest known flood on Earth in the last 10,000 years,
The evidence for the flood came from unusual sediment found in the Jishi Gorge of the Yellow River. By analysing and dating this sediment - as well as the remains of children who died in an earthquake in the nearby archaeological site of Lajia - the research team was able to establish an approximate timeline of the events. They estimate that the same earthquake that killed the children in Lajia also caused a landslide that damned the Yellow River in the Jishi Gorge. The water built up behind the dam until it spilled over the top and eventually caused the entire wall to collapse, sending a backlog of water and debris downriver to flood the lowlands that were the Great China Plain.
The evidence actually suggests that this particular flood occurred several centuries later than the date for the tale of king Yū, but the dating matches up with the region's major transition from the Neolithic period to the Bronze Age period. Perhaps the flood episode collected around the figure of Yū. But king Yū's flood now stands as another story potentially originating in geologic events. According to the research team the flood shares the main characteristics of the Great Flood described in the ancient texts and it was just as devastating as the ancient stories suggest.
The Mu Tianzi zhuan and king Mu of Zhou
In her book From Deluge to Discourse (1996) Deborah Porter examines what has generally been considered one of the earliest examples of Chinese fiction, the Mu Tianzi zhuan, a narrative of the early Zhou king Mu's journey to the West. In doing so she connects it with the "Yu-kung" ("Yu gong") section of the Book of Documents (Shujing, or Shangshu) or Classic of History, containing the early Yū myths concerning Yū's control of the floodwaters. The "Yu-kung" section consists largely of a geographical description of China in the time of the Emperor Yū.
The "Yu gong" ("Tribute of Yu") is a chapter of the Book of Xia section of the Book of Documents, one of the Five Classics of ancient Chinese literature. The chapter describes the legendary Yū the Great and the provinces of his time. The dating is somewhat problematic. Many modern scholars believe it was written in the 5th-century BCE or later. According to Chinese tradition, Confucius (551-479 BCE) compiled the Book of Documents and included the "Yu gong." Some scholars believe it is more likely that this was done later. The Chinese scholar Wang Guowei (18771927) suggested in his (book?/article?) New Confirmation of Ancient History that the "Yu gong" was written at the start of the Zhou Dynasty, but many scholars now believe with the view of the Chinese historian Gu Jiegang (1893-1980) that it is a product of the Warring States (circa 5th- to 3rd-century BCE), Qin or Early Han periods.
The Mu Tianzi zhuan is considered to be the fictitious report of the journey of King Mu of the Zhou dynasty to encounter the deity Queen Mother of the West (or simply a fictitious version of his travels. King Mu of Zhou was the 5th king of the Chinese Zhou Dynasty. The dates of his reign are 976-922 BCE or 956-918 BCE. Mu came into the throne after his father King Zhao's death during his tour to the South. King Mu was perhaps the most pivotal king of the Zhou dynasty. During Mu's reign, the Zhou Dynasty was at its peak. He liked to travel and in particular visited the Kunlun Mountains several times during his reign. It is claimed that he traveled 90,000 kilometers to the west. Mu introduced reforms that changed the nature of the Zhou Dynasty government, transforming it from a hereditary system to one that was based on merit and knowledge of administrative skills. Mu attempted to repulse invaders in the western part of China and he also expanded Zhou's influence to the east. At the height of his ambition for conquests he led an immense army against the Quanrong, who inhabited the western part of China, but was not successful. His travels allowed him to contact many tribes and sway them to either join under the Zhou banner or be conquered in war with his army. His successor was his son King Gong of Zhou.
The written originals of the fictitious biography of King Mu and a biography of his mother were found along with the Bamboo Annals in the tomb of Wei Xiang-zi (died 296 BCE), king of Wei, rediscovered in 281 CE during the Jin dynasty, after which they were merged into a single tale during transmission. Transmitted are 4 textual lineages which became independent from the original. Later versions were sometimes called Zhou Wang Youxing, literally "(The) Zhou King('s) Travels" or "Travels of the Zhou King." (The Bamboo Annals are a history of earlier periods of China compiled at a later time. A slightly more skeptical description is the Bamboo Annals were allegedly found in a tomb about 280 CE, but they purport to date to the reign of the King Xiang of Wei, who died in 296 BCE.)
"As both Porter and Mathieu have suggested, the story of King Mu was formed through the transposition of mythological themes and traditions into a fictional romance set within a mock historical framework. The most important of the myths that formed the tale of King Mu and his journey were those devoted to Yu and his taming of the flood." (The Construction of Space in Early China by Mark Lewis (2012, Page 258).)
Yū the Great (circa 2200-2101 BCE) is considered to be a legendary ruler in ancient China famed for his introduction of flood control, inaugurating dynastic rule in China by founding the Xia Dynasty, and for his upright moral character. The dates proposed for Yū's reign precede the oldest known written records in China, the oracle bones of the late Shang dynasty, by nearly 1000 years. No inscriptions on artifacts from the supposed era of Yū, nor the later oracle bones, make any mention of Yū; he does not appear in inscription until vessels dating to the Western Zhou period (circa 1045-771 BCE).
The lack of anything remotely close to contemporary documentary evidence has led to some controversy over the historicity of Yū. Proponents of the historicity of Yū theorise that stories about his life and reign were transmitted orally in various areas of China until they were recorded in the Zhou dynasty, while opponents believe the figure existed in legend in a different form - as a god or mythical animal - in the Xia dynasty, and morphed into a human figure by the start of the Zhou dynasty. Many of the stories about Yū were collected in Sima Qian's famous Records of the Grand Historian. Yū and other "sage-kings" of ancient China were lauded for their virtues and morals by Confucius and other Chinese teachers. Yū is one of the few Chinese rulers posthumously honored with the epithet "the Great."



Note: Prior to her book, Porter wrote a lengthy article on the topic. "The Literary Function of K'un-lun Mountain in the Mu T'ien-tzu chuan." by Deborah Porter (Early China, Volume 18, 1993, Pages 73-106). Abstract: "In this article I question the assumption that all place-names in the Mu T'ien-tzu chuan refer to real places. I suggest instead a mythic origin for many of these seemingly referential elements. By analyzing a complex of myths either referred to or alluded to in the text, I show that several crucial place-names come in fact from cosmological referents rather than geographical ones. The Mu T'ien-tzu chuan cannot then be read purely as a historical account. I extend this argument by revealing how the elements of cosmological myth in the narrative must themselves be read as elements of symbolic discourse; that is, they have to be read within an astronomical context as references to celestial phenomena. By reading the cosmological and astronomical discourses of the myths together, I demonstrate the literary significance of the Mu T'ien-tzu chuan, a significance which to date has been obscured by misreadings of its historicity. Finally, I argue that only by reading the Mu T'ien-tzu chuan as a literary fiction can one understand what it tells us about how notions of political legitimacy were constructed and then altered in the representation of King Mu's (fictional) journey. The narrative is thus revealed to be a wholly symbolic tale whose interpretation has implications for the wider realm of the interconnections among history, literature and culture."

The myth of knowledge of precession in the Eddas
As an example of the problem with the uninformed use of numbers in a supposedly astronomical context. It is not unusual to hear the claim repeated that knowledge of precession appears in the Eddas (a collection of old Norse poems and tales dating circa 10th-century CE). The claim simply rests on verse 23 of the poem Grimnismál in the Eddas. At Ragnarök ("end of the world") out of each of the 540 doors of Valholl ("hall of the dead" or "hall of the slain") will come 800 warriors. (It is also pointed out that in verse 24 of the poem there are 540 rooms (or "floor-rooms") in Thor's palace of Bilskirnir.)
Stanza 23 of Grimnismál has the descriptive lines: "Five hundred doors and forty, Think I there at Valholl; Eight hundred einhergar go out one door, When they go to fight with the wolf."
Valholl was the largest building in Asgard, the celestial realm of the Norse gods/goddesses. The number of doors is multiplied by the number of warriors emerging from each door to achieve an end number of 432,000 warriors. (This calculation and the resulting number of 432,000 is not in the Eddas.) The claim is then made that the number 432,000 refers to a precessional "great year." It has also been asserted that this number shows that there is an astronomical lore in the Edda that is part of an ancient astronomical tradition. A link is made with the Vedas.
It is correct that according some sources Valholl has 540 doors each wide enough for 800 warriors. It is correct that the 540 rooms (or "floorrooms") in Bilskirnir can match the version of 540 doors of Valholl. However, I do not recall any "associated number" such as 800 (or 960) warriors (or whatever) connected with Bilskirnir. Also, according to other sources Valholl has 640 doors each wide enough for 960 warriors. Hence out of the medieval tale we can multiply the former figures and get the resulting number 432,000 or we can multiply the latter figures and get the number 614,400. The figure of 432,000 may be linked with the Babylonian doctrine of "cosmic recurrence" (i.e., a "great year" linked to "powerful" conjunctions, not a precessional "great year"). I have never seen the figure 614,400 touted as belonging to either. (A prime candidate for uncritically promulgating this sort of arithmetic is the Jungian mythologist Joseph Campbell in his (for example) book The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology (1964, Page 459).)
The supporters of knowledge of precession in the Eddas seem to have no knowledge of the old Germanic system of calculation. In the old Germanic system of reckoning the "long hundred" had the value of 120. In Old Norse usage hundrath (hundraô) usually meant120 (of anything), not 100. This form of early measure (long hundred/great hundred) was common during the Viking Age and was continued (in a number of countries influenced by Norse culture) as common usage up till circa 1700 CE. The number 100, now known commonly as "one hundred" was, prior to circa 1700 CE (in countries influenced by Norse culture), known as "the small hundred." There was also (though less common) a long thousand, meaning 1200. Note: The "long hundred" (120) is mainly attested in Old English and Old Norse. In Old English 2 types of 100 existed: a "hund teontig" (= a short (100) hundred) and a "hund twelftig" (= a long (120) hundred).
In all likelihood the "five hundred ... and forty" and the "eight hundred" have the Germanic "long hundred" value (not the decimal value 100). Hence 640 doors and 960 warriors. Even orthodox writers may or may not indicate knowledge of the old Germanic system of calculation. Norse Mythology by John Lindow (2001) simply gives 540 doors and 800 warriors. World Mythology by Donna Rosenberg (2nd edition., 1994) simply gives 640 doors and 960 warriors. Myth and Religion of the North by Edward Turville-Petre (1964) gives both 540 (or 640) doors and 800 (or 960) warriors. An important discussion of the issues by Magnus Olsen appeared in (the Danish language) Acta Philologica Scandinavica, Volume VI, 1931-1932. (The particular paper was later included in his collected papers Norrone studier (1938).) See also the (English-language) discussions: "Remnants of Medieval Symbolic Number Usage in Northern Europe." by Jens Ulff-Møller (1993). In: Medieval Numerology: A Book of Essays edited by Robert Surles (Pages 143-156); and "Numeracy and the Germanic Upper Decades." by Carol Justus (Journal of Indo-European Studies, Volume 24, 1996). Worth reading is, Number Symbolism in Old Norse Literature: A Brief Study by Li Tang (2013 PhD Thesis, University of Iceland). Abstract: "It is generally agreed that some numbers such as three and nine which appear frequently in the two Eddas hold special significances in Norse mythology. Furthermore, numbers appearing in sagas not only denote factual quantity, but also stand for specific symbolic meanings. This tradition of number symbolism could be traced to Pythagorean thought and to St. Augustine’s writings. But the result in Old Norse literature is its own system influenced both by Nordic beliefs and Christianity. This double influence complicates the intertextuality in the light of which the symbolic meanings of numbers should be interpreted. At the same time, the influence is better examined because of the cultural collision reflected in number symbolism. This thesis focuses on eight special numbers (three, seven, eight, nine, ten, twelve, thirteen and eighteen) giving special attention to their symbolism. It then turns to explain how the symbolism of these numbers functions in certain sagas or some specific episodes to suit their author’s needs. Saga writing is a process combining historical accounts and imaginary additions. Just like the four methods of allegorical interpretation to explain the Bible, saga reading can thus also be made at different levels."
References to Valholl can thus have the numbers 540 and 800 or 640 and 960. References to Bilskirnir simply have the number 540 but not 640 nor 800 or 960. Some people are keen to multiply 540 by 800 but not 640 by 960.
For the number 540 Vincent Hopper suggested (Medieval Number Symbolism, 1938, reprinted 1978) that the Medieval Norse (1) had an idealised 360 day year calendar (adjusted by intercalation), (2) calculated time by half years; and (3) 540 denotes a calendar cycle of 3 half years (wintersummer-winter). It seems we may be playing with nothing deeper than mundane calendar-based numbers.
A further (standard) study of Valholl is Walhall by Gustav Neckel (1913). His opinion was the "five hundred ... and forty" doors intends to express nothing more than a large number and was perhaps influence by Norse knowledge of the numerous doorways (and vomitoria) of the Roman



Colosseum (Coliseum). There were 80 entrances at ground level. However, the Colosseum incorporated a number of vomitoria - passageways designed so that the venue could quickly disperse people into their seats (in 15 minutes), and evacuate them abruptly (in 5 minutes).

[Note: "Abstract: This paper aims to explain the eschatological outbreak that occurred during the X century in Scandinavia and northern Europe, which gave rise to a great iconography of Ragnarök, stemmed primarily from the Old Norse mythology. Our basic hypothesis is that various astronomical phenomena which occurred during in the VIII and IX centuries (total eclipses of the sun and passages of comets, both related to the constellation of Wolf's Jaw - the Hyades) have aroused in the Nordic man his eschatological fears, impelling him to create a large amount apocalyptic images close of the year 1000 AD. We identified thirteen celestial phenomena (comet passages and total eclipses of the Sun) that may have been collected in the construction of the Ragnarök image among the ancient Norsemen. Our main methodology is the Cultural Astronomy, coupled with the prospects of the cultural history of myths. Aided by several studies on medieval astronomical folklore, especially those related to comets and eclipses. We also use some recent research on the theme of celestial myths and Old Norse Astronomy developed by European and American scholars, such as Gísli Sigurðsson, Thomas DuBois, Christan Etheridge and Dorian Knight."

Hawaiian Star Voyaging
Suggestive of knowledge of the effects of precession is the need to name new stars set out in The History of Kanalu Mo'oku'auhau 'Elua, a Genealogical History of the Priesthood of Kanalu, by Benjamin Namakaokeahi, translated by Malcolm Naea Chun. [The Kanalu story was first printed a century ago in a Hawaiian newspaper (Ka Nupepa Ku'O[sic?]oko'a, 1900-1901), as written by Benjamin Namakaokeahi. The history of Kanalu = Mo'oku'auhau 'elua : genealogical history of the priesthood of Kanalu transcribed/translation by Benjamin Namakaokeahi (1896?; circa 1900; Malcolm Chun (translator/editor 2004).] This Hawai.ian collection of chants, comprising a pre-European contact genealogy of traditional star priests, repeatedly sets out the need to name new stars approximately every 300–400 years. Studies by Martha Noyes based on her research of astronomy at the O'ahu site Kūkaniloko, is that the date of the rise/set of stars changed, and these changes were enough during several generations that "new" stars had to be named for calendar dates because the former stars for those dates have changed their "path." The effects of precession seem indicated. The History of Kanalu .... is specific to the Kanalu lineage of star priests. Martha Noyes, an expert on ancient Hawaiian astronomy, believes that there are similar chants in other parts of Polynesia as long distance voyaging needed a fair degree of astronomical accuracy. Long distance voyaging, at least between islands, needed a fair degree of astronomical accuracy.
Temple alignment
If ancient observers were aware of the effects of precession they did not know what it was or how to calculate it. It is argued that with ancient temple orientation (or standing stones), to whatever direction, there is slight adjustment when a new temple is built on the site of an old one. A solstice alignment could only be used for approximately 1000 years, the amount of time it would take to no longer get a valid observation. Günter Martiny did a lot of work on Babylonian temple orientation regarding precessional adjustments. His proofs, first set out in his 34-page Die Kultrichtung in Mesopotamia (1932), remain controversial. See the (German-language) book reviews in ZA, NF Band 8 (Band 42), 1934, Pages 198-217.
Plato (circa 428-348 BCE) and the Great Year and precession
In the Classical world it was Plato of Athens (writing before Berossos' account) who first made a clear statement of the Great Year which he termed the Perfect Year (also translated as Complete Year). Plato defined the Perfect Year as a period at the end of which the fixed stars and planets return to the point from which they started their revolution. The end of Plato's Perfect Year was not marked by a conflagration. Plato's Perfect Year (also known as the Platonic Year) in Timaeus (39d) is linked to the idea of 'powerful' conjunctions (the return of the planets to the same position) and not to the idea of precession or to the equinoxes and solstices. (The Perfect Year (Great Year), in Plato's Timaeus simply refers to a complete circle of all the 8 spheres (the 8th sphere/circuit is presumably that of the Fixed Stars), to the time needed to return again to the same cosmic configuration.) However, in another part of Timaeus Plato states that also the stars have at very lengthy periods of time an aberration of their position causing a great fire etc. This paragraph of Plato is mentioned by Clement of Alexandria in his Stromata (or Stromateis) (2nd-century CE). Later, in the 5th-century, Macrobius Theodosius in his Commentary on the Dream of Scipio writes that the Great Year is not only a return of the planets but involves an even more longer period as a "proper" motion of the stars. Thus the connection between Perfect Year (Great Year) and the motion of the stars in long periods can be traced back as far as Plato.
Note: Nowhere in the Timaeus does Plato talk of precession. In section 38 Plato has clearly defined 2 sorts of celestial motion: (1) the motion of the planets through the sky from west to east, and (2) the diurnal motion of the entire sky from west to east. The motion of the 8th sphere/circuit is clearly a diurnal motion; not precessional motion. If Plato had known of precession and was referring to it he would undoubtedly had to explain it in terms of a 3rd motion.
Plato never gives a figure for his Perfect (Great) Year. Later commentators later gave assumed the value of 36,000 years but a rationale was not given until the 1890s. See (the speculative discussion): The Nuptial Number of Plato by James Adam (1891). James Adam argued that various passages in the Republic could be read as a code justifying the 36,000 year figure. A critical discussion of Adam's method of extracting a period of 36,000 years from Plato's Republic appears in Aristarchus of Samos by Thomas Heath (1913, Pages 171-173). It is only in later Greek and Latin texts that Plato's cosmic period is termed the Great Year. Precession is not involved.
Ptolemy and Hipparchus' knowledge of precession
There is no discussion of precession and calendrical problems caused by it by Greek astronomers before Hipparchus. Noel Swerdlow, in his review of David Ulansey's book (The Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries), in Classical Philology, Volume 85, January-October, 1991, Pages 48-63, notes that Ptolemy (circa 150 CE) is the earliest surviving writer to mention precession (which is approximately 300 years after Hipparchus). The few other early mentions are by Origen Adamantius (184/185-253/254 CE, early Christian Alexandrian scholar and theologian-philosopher) and Theon of Alexandria (circa 335-405 CE, Greek mathematician and astronomer). Also, the Greek Neoplatonist philosopher Proclus Lycaeus (/Proclus Diadochus) who lived some 300 years after Ptolemy is apparently the only philosopher to take note of precession (and he simply denied it). Ptolemy (2nd-century CE) is the first astronomer known to have continued Hipparchus' work on precession. The Almagest is the principal ancient source for the discussion of precession. Ptolemy's account (Almagest 3.1, and 7. 1-3) of Hipparchus' discovery of precession describes that Hipparchus' description of what his observations showed and ideas (Hipparchus offered several explanations) were tentative and uncertain. It was Ptolemy, working some 3 centuries after Hipparchus made his discovery, who confirmed the precession involved a motion of the entire sphere of the fixed stars with respect to the equinoxes. Ptolemy defined precession as the uniform increase in the longitudes of the fixed stars.



An interesting quote from Origen Adamantius: "There is a well known theorem which proves that the Zodiac, like the planets, moves from west to east at the rate of one part in a hundred years, and that this movement in the lapse of so long a time changes the local relation of the signs; so that, on the one hand, there is the invisible sign, and on the other, as it were, the visible figure of it; and events, they say, are discovered not from the figure, but from the invisible sign; though it cannot possibly be apprehended." (Origen. The Philocalia of Origen translated by George Lewis (1911, Page 191).)
Still worth reading is, "Hipparchus and the Precession of the Equinoxes." by Reverend Maxwell Close (Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Third Series, Volume 6, 1900-1902, Pages 450-456).
Note: The fact that hardly any ancient writers after Hipparchus mention precession perhaps indicates that precession was not properly understood or that it was not considered interesting or important.
The myth of an Age of Pisces in early Christianity
There was no Age of Pisces at the time Christianity originated. No textual evidence from Dionysius Exiguus, or any contemporary or predecessor, of a perceived Christianity-Pisces link has ever been produced. The association between Christianity and Pisces is of later medieval origin. See: "The "Star of the Messiah." Reconsidered" by Roy Rosenberg in Biblica, Volume 53, 1972, Pages 105-109. It is essentially a discussion of the Jewish philosopher Isaac Abrabanel's (1437-1508) views of the signs Pisces, Aries, and Virgo and their associations. The best attempt at evidence by Rothwangl (Hastro-L, 2 May 2001) is to refer to his belief that the triple alignment (as Rothwangl likes to call it) in Pisces in & BCE was the Star of Bethlehem, and the Fish as a painting and as the pictograph ICHTHYS as the first sign of the Christians. (Excursus: A monumental study is IXΘYC: Das Fischsymbol in frühchristlicher Zeit by Franz Dölger (a German Catholic theologian and church historian, life dates: 1879-1940) (1922-1928, 2 Volumes. First published in 1-Volume in 1910.). Also relevant: Orpheus the Fisher: Comparative Studies in Orphic and Early Christian Cult Symbolism by Robert Eisler (1921).) Some of the several speculative 'vacuum-cleaner' arguments include: (1) Precession was mentioned by Origen Adamantius (184/185-253/254 CE), early Christian Alexandrian scholar and theologian. If he knew about it then other Christian would also. We can suppose the beginning of the Christian revelation would be associated with a new "World Age," especially when it coincided with the beginning of a new "Platonic month," with the movement of the vernal equinox into Pisces. (2) In the brief polemical Latin treatise on baptism, (De baptismo, i) by the Church Father Tertullian (circa 155-circa 240) he writes, "But we little fish, like our Fish Jesus Christ, are born in water ...." These are not effective evidence of a Pisces World Age. The only other comparison is the Christian Bishop Zeno of Verona (circa 300-371) who in a Paschal baptismal homily gives the 12 signs of the zodiac a Christian interpretation to accommodate the "curiositas" as to what sign they are being reborn under. He begins with Aries and ends with Pisces, saying: "How necessary it is that in one sign follows the two Fishes, that is two peoples from the Jews and the Gentiles by the living waters of baptism are signified as one people of Christ by one sign." (See: Ancient Astrology by Tamsyn Barton (1994, Page 71).) This also is not effective evidence of a Pisces World Age. The earliest extant example of precession being used to undermine astrology was written by the Church father and early Christian theologian Origen of Alexandria (circa 184/5253/254), who spent the first half of his career in Alexandria. Origen was not an astrologer. It is evidence that precession was understood. It is not evidence that system of zodiacal "World Ages" was established or that there was currently an "Age of Pisces." First example, The Philocalia of Origen, (an anthology (compilation of selected passages) of Origen's texts, probably compiled by Basil of Caesarea and Gregory of Nazianzus, English-language translation by George Lewis (1911; XXIII Fate, Astrology, etc., see specifically Page 191, Paragraph 18): "There is a wellknown theorem which proves that the Zodiac, like the planets, moves from west to east at the rate of one part in a hundred years, and that this movement in the lapse of so long a time changes the local relation of the signs; so that, on the one hand, there is the invisible sign, and on the other, as it were, the visible figure of it; and events, they say, are discovered not from the figure, but from the invisible sign ...." I have not seen a more recent translation. Second example, referenced as, De Oratione, [= On Prayer; a treatise on prayer] 27 [likely, Origen's Treatise on Prayer: Translation and Notes with an Account of the Practice and Doctrine of Prayer from New Testament Times to Origen by Eric Jay (1954)]: "As the last month is the end of the year, after which the beginning of another month ensues, so it may be that since several ages complete a year of ages, the present age is the end, after which certain ages to come will ensue, of which the age to come is the beginning ...." However, the translation by William Curtis (https://www.ccel.org/ccel/pearse/morefathers/files/origen_on_prayer_02_text.htm) differs in text and meaning. Translation by William Curtis of the complete passage: "Well, in conjecture as to matters so great, I believe that, just as the year's consummation is it's last month after which arises another month's beginning, so probably the present age is a consummation of numerous ages completing as it were a year of ages, and after it certain coming ages will arise whose beginning is the coming age, and in those coming ages God shall show forth the riches of His Grace in kindness, when the greatest sinner, who for having spoken ill against the Holy Spirit is held fast by his sin throughout the present age and the coming one from beginning to end, shall after that, I know not how, receive a dispensation." It is pointed out that the first of these 2 remarks relating to a connection between astrology and the zodiac and its movements and how Origen differentiates between "invisible signs" (= the tropical signs?) and their "figures" (the starry constellations?). Also claimed that the suggestion of "new ages" indicates the precession-like conception involved in his thought, and the progression of the "ages." It is an obviously weak argument. It is not able to be claimed as definite evidence for precessional "World Ages" and there is no mention of an "Age of Pisces." With the second of these 2 remarks the translation by Curtis shows clearly there is no connection with astrology or precessional "World Ages" and there is no mention of an "Age of Pisces." (3) There is useful material in David Fideler's book, Jesus Christ, Sun of God: Ancient Cosmology and Early Christian Symbolism (1993). The blurb for the book reads: "The early Christian Gnosis did not spring up in isolation, but drew upon earlier sources. In this book, many of these sources are revealed for the first time. Special emphasis is placed on the Hellenistic doctrine of the "Solar Logos" and the early Christian symbolism which depicted Christ as the Spiritual Sun, the illumination source of order, harmony, and spiritual insight. Based on 15 years of research, this is a unique book which throws a penetrating light on the secret traditions of early Christianity. It clearly demonstrates that number is at the heart of being. Jesus Christ, Sun of God, illustrates how the Christian symbolism of the Spiritual Sun is derived from numerical symbolism of the "ancient divinities."" Both "Precession" and "Age of Pisces" are listed in the index: "Pisces, Age of, and Christian fish symbolism, 161-62; inaugurated by triple conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, 166, 168-69 ... Precession of the equinoxes, 149-151; described by Origen, 345 n. 12; and religious symbolism, 160-163." There is interesting material in David Fideler's book, but also fanciful speculation. Fideler uses material and arguments from David Ulansey and Carl Jung. A house of cards is constructed. (4) David Ulansey has shown quite convincingly in his book, The Origin of the Mithraic Mysteries (1989) that knowledge of the precession of the equinoxes knowledge of precession is the central secret of the Roman Mithraic mysteries, and is discoverable in Mithraic iconography. Ulansey's claims lack any credible evidence or argument and is nothing more than fanciful speculation. Importantly, David Ulansey has never provided any evidence that 'zodiacal ages/astrological ages' as developed by 19thcentury theosophy and early 20th-century astrology was also a concept understood anywhere at all in the ancient Greco-Roman world. (The concept of precessional "world ages" can be traced back to Origine des tous les cultes: ou, Religion universelle by Charles Dupuis (1794).) See further: Page 11-17. Once again, worth reading is "Hipparchus and the Precession of the Equinoxes." by Maxwell Close (Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Third Series, Volume 6, 1900-1902, Pages 450-456).
Likely Mesopotamian origin of magical numbers
The ideas that numbers have magical significance is very old and likely originated in Mesopotamia. The number 72 is now commonly claimed as a precessional number by devotees of Hamlet's Mill. However, it cannot have been a precession number in antiquity. The 12-constellation zodiac (of



equal divisions) and measured by 360 degrees dates from circa 420 BCE and no evidence exists for knowledge of precession until the 2nd-century BCE. The association made by Hamlet's Mill devotees is simply a numerical 'odd-match.' The origin(s) of the number 72 remain obscure. 72 is the prime magic number, divisible by all other numbers from 1 to 9 except for 5 itself, and the other magic number 72; it is also divisible by the zodiacal number, 12, and multiples of 12 by 2, 3, and 6. There is no compelling reason to associate this number with astronomy (though it is possible to associate it with the motions of Venus and Jupiter) or the seasons (6 x 12). The Babylonian ideal year of 360 days divided by 72 gave 5-day weeks (conversely the division of 5-day weeks into the ideal year of 360 days gives the number 72. The number 72 is a reciprocal number. It can originate through multiplication (9 x 8 = 72) and it is 1 of 24 divisors into 360 (= 5). The number 72 is indeed close to the 71.667 years it takes to move through one degree of one sign of the Zodiac. However, 72 (years) also figures in the cycles of Jupiter and Venus. It takes Jupiter 71.1708 years to go around the Sun 6 times. Venus goes around the Sun 8 times whilst the Earth goes around the Sun 5 times. It takes the Earth two days longer to complete this interesting cycle. Due to this ratio, Venus appears to draw a pentagram around the Sun every 8 years. Venus takes 72 years of 365.25 days each, less 18 days to complete 9 pentagrams around the Sun. Also, 72 (years) figures in the Saros cycle (used in ancient times to calculate eclipses). This cycle was 18.03 years, 4 x 18.03 = 72.12 years. More mundanely, Confucius is said to have had 72 disciples (the 72 Worthies), he was also said to be 72 years old when he died. Also, there are 72 malignant spirits in Chinese folk medicine. In the Chuang-tzu there are 72 treacherous rulers. The legendary Chinese ruler, Shen Nong, is said to have discovered tea as an antidote to the 72 poisons he encountered in the development of traditional Chinese medicine. The number 72 appears frequently in Chinese folklore: 72 halls in an underwater palace, 72 merits of a hero and 72 stars in the sky. The number 72 has a relationship to the number 70. There are many example where the number 72 interchangeable with the number 70. Within the context of Mesopotamian number magic it has been noted that all derivatives or multiples of 7 carry with them the idea of wholeness. The number 72 is closely associated with other number '7s' principally: 7 (commonly associated with cosmic perfection), 70, 71, 72, and 73. 70 = 10 x 7; 72 can be divided by: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36; 77, and 7 x 7 are self explanatory, as well as 700, 7000, 70,000, 700,000. The number 7 may symbolise the literary/mythical vertical (levels)/horizontal (chambers) structure of the cosmos.
The claim for precession as secret knowledge
According to Hamlet's Mill an advanced astronomical knowledge was kept secret from the majority of people by it being veiled in the language of myth.
I am unsure who originated the argument that supposed knowledge of precession was supposedly kept secret by its discoverers comprising some sort of 'priestly class' (even though diffused world-wide by them to other 'priestly classes'). Apparently the original discovers presumed they had made a one-off discovery. The proponents of the argument are unable to make any sort of evidentiary case. The claim for world-wide ancient knowledge of precession being kept as secret knowledge is simply baseless speculation. The historian of ancient mathematical astronomy Otto Neugebauer has made the point that no transmitted sources contain any hint which implies ancient secret knowledge of precession or advanced astronomical knowledge deliberately withheld from widespread communication. (According to Otto Neugebauer the only ancient "book of secrets" he ever discovered concerned computation with fractions.) It is a rather odd claim for a number of reasons. The claim is somewhat limited to precession impacting upon established religions and cults and supposedly being able to cause 'panic' among devotees. Strangely, this supposed determination for alleged secrecy ensured that calendrical assistance to ensure accurate astronomical calendars was also withheld. This robs the argument that knowledge of precession by an ancient elite enabled them to exercise power over the uninformed general population. Why some sort of world-wide 'professional/academic secrecy' would make a difference to eventual commonly observable changed appearances (i.e., changes in heliacal risings of stars) is not explained. Why the ancient Neolithic discoverers of knowledge of precession 'packaged' this knowledge for worldwide diffusion is not explained. Nor is it explained how this was achieved so quickly. It hardly matters anyway as it only adds more baseless conjecture to the imaginary schema. It is possible to accept and adjust to changing celestial appearances without the need for explanation (and an anxiety-driven one at that). Why the discovery of precession should cause terror among all people who became aware of it - with nobody over thousands of years thinking otherwise - becomes a process of speculation and mystery. The Chinese experience of the discovery of precession shows concern only for achieving calendar accuracy. The earliest tentative awareness of precession in China took hold in the Hou Han (= later Han) period. (The later Han period is also now referred to as the Eastern Han Dynasty and spanned from 25 to 220 CE.) During this period it was quite widely recognised that the calendar altered (i.e., became unreliable) every 300 years. That is, every 300 years there was a requirement to use a new calendar. Multiple mentions of the fact that the calendar was only good for 300 years appears in the multiple volumes of the Hou Hanshu (= Book of the Later Han) by the historian Fan Ye (flourished 398-445 CE).
Regarding ancient Mesopotamia: Only a few dozen cuneiform tablets - dealing with Mesopotamian wisdom - contain a secrecy label (i.e., the knowledge was restricted). Some cuneiform tablets (as example, KAR 307 = VAT 8917, one of a small number of ̃1st-millennium BCE mysticalreligious compilations) include in the colophon the statement they contain privileged information ("secret of the great gods") and warns the reader "let the knowing reveal it only to the knowing, do not let the unknowing view it, it is a taboo of the great gods." This privileged information consists mainly of identifications and explanations. Much of the information given in KAR 307 relates to the battles of the gods Marduk and Ninurta against their enemies. (See: Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography by Wayne Horowitz (1998, Pages 5-6).) The concept of privileged knowledge is unrelated to astronomical texts.
In his book, Astrology and Cosmology in Early China (2013) the sinologist David Pankenier upholds the discounted view that Chinese professional astronomers were a cabal practicing in secret for the government.
Also, the myths are not myths secretly kept by an intellectual elite - they are common myths.
Note: Why ancient people initiated into knowledge of precession should also share alarmist concerns regarding it, and jointly continue to remained alarmed by it, is never explained (i.e., the 'world mill' never really breaks asunder). However, a modern devotee, Walter Cruttendon, offers, the slow movement of the earth in its precessional cycle indirectly causes the very rise and fall of civilisation.
Needless to say, an ancient cabal of astronomer-priests who knew all about precession has never been demonstrated. Hamlet's Mill has not offered any convincing mechanism of (ready) replacement of traditional mythology with a new one (an astronomical monomyth) due to largely superficial contacts. According to anthropologists, within known history oral traditions are generally not transmitted and maintained by the community as a whole, but by special individuals responsible for their preservation. This fact relates to the issue of acceptance/replacement of story material within a culture/community. The special individuals were story keepers/tellers, not astronomer-priests. As example: Amongst the Zuni astronomer-priests and story tellers were different individuals.
A 'modern' cult centred on precession as secret knowledge?
David Ulansey's claim that the Roman Mithraic cult is a precession cult is not satisfactorily demonstrated. David Ulansey's claim is primarily set out in his book, The Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries: Cosmology and Salvation in the Ancient World (1989; reprinted 1991). Note: Published in



Turkish in 1998; and published in Italian in 2001. In his book, Romanising Oriental Gods (2008, 2010) the author Jaime Alvar states (Page 97): "... a book neatly calculated to appeal to a wide public." Ulansey's book is exclusively concerned with an astral interpretation of Mithraism. The book comprises a wildly speculative precessional interpretation of the Mithraic religion. (In his web discussions Ulansey continues to adhere to a loose method of defending/arguing his ideas.) The author holds that Cilician pirates (residing in Asia Minor (= Turkey) and numbering some 20,000 persons) contributed to the development/propagation the Mithraic mysteries using Hipparchus' discovery of precession. Ulansey's key belief for the origin of Mithraism is that it is the product of an intellectual exercise by a small group of Tarsian Stoics who created a religion to explain Hipparchan precession. (In a nutshell: According to David Ulansey, Mithraism originated among the 20,000 strong pirates of Cicilia (Asia Minor = Turkey), the capital city of which was Tarsus.) Based on his 1984 Princeton University doctoral thesis titled: Mithras and Perseus: Mithraic Astronomy and the Anatolian Perseus-Cult. Highly speculative, selective, and controversial. (Ulansey received his PhD in (1984) in Religion from Princeton University.) The author (basically a "New-Ager") holds to a Jungian viewpoint for the interpretation of mythology. (Ulansey is a frequent lecturer at the C. G. Jung Institute of San Francisco.) The book sets out a theory of the astronomical origin of Mithraism only. It does not contain any examination of the history of Mithraism nor does it contain any exposition of Mithraic cultic practices. As far as I am aware Ulansey has never engaged in any archaeological work concerning Mithraism and his few published articles on Mithraism, with one or two exceptions i.e., "Mithras and the Hypercosmic Sun" in Studies in Mithraism edited by John Hinnells (1994), basically repeat his book. (Ulansey's 1994 paper reappears as "Mithras, the Hypercosmic Sun, and the Rockbirth." in Alexandria 5: The Journal of Western Cosmological Traditions edited by David Fideler (April, 2000).) The author's astronomical ideas concerning Mithraism originated during a 1977 brain-storming session, on a picture of the Mithraic myth of the bull slaying, conducted in a graduate class on the Mystery Religions by Professor John Gager. (Ulansey is/was an amateur astronomer.) This immediate conclusion of Ulansey's has been kept by him and forms the basis for his continuing rejection of the theories of recognized Mithraic scholars. (From Ulansey's ongoing involvement in web discussions it is clear that he does not admit any requirement to modify his original position set out in his 1989 book.) It is tempting to see a connection with the visionary techniques of Carl Jung. On at least one occasion Jung's own visionary experiences involved himself mimicing the Mithraic Leontocephalus. Also, Jung was very much interested in the Mystery Religions and was especially fascinated with the Mithraic iconography of Mithras slaying a bull. See especially his repeated explorations of the Mithraic tauroctony in his book, Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (1912). Ulansey openly admits that he is not comfortable with mainstream scholarship in general. David Ulansey has a Ph.D. from Princeton University. Circa the early 1990s) he joined the California Institute of Integral Studies as a professor in the Philosophy, Cosmology and Consciousness Program. Currently (2012), he is Visiting Professor of Religious Studies at U.C. Berkeley, and Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and Religion at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco. This is a private graduate school with approximately 1000 (mostly part-time) students that is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (a regional accrediting agency recognised by the United States Department of Education). Ulansey usually identifies himself as a historian of religion(s), with a focus on the ancient Mystery Religions, Gnosticism, and early Christianity. (From Ulansey’s homepage (2013): " ... Visiting Professor of Religious Studies at U.C. Berkeley, and Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and Religion at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco. ... [A] scholar of the history of religions, comparative religion, and cultural history (Ph.D., Princeton Univ.), and before teaching at CIIS ... was on the faculties of the University of California at Berkeley, Boston University, Barnard College (Columbia University), the University of Vermont, Princeton University, and Pacifica Graduate Institute. ... [S]pecialty is the religions of the ancient Mediterranean world, especially the ancient Mystery religions, Gnosticism, ancient cosmology, and early Christianity. ... [H]ave also taught courses in a variety of more speculative areas such as the evolution of consciousness, archetypal psychology, alchemical symbolism, the metaphysics of cyberspace, and applied deep ecology, and ... have been a frequent lecturer at the San Francisco C.G. Jung Institute.") Ulansey teaches and writes on the history of religions, comparative religion, and cultural history. The Philosophy, Cosmology and Consciousness Program which he helped to start was conceived of as a combination of Western esotericism and selected scientific themes. The California Institute of Integral Studies, has undergone several transformations since originating in the early 1950s under the influence of the teachings of eastern gurus and similar. Prior to teaching at CIIS he was on the faculties of the University of California at Berkeley, Boston University, Barnard College (Columbia University), the University of Vermont, Princeton University, and Pacifica Graduate Institute. His main interests are the religions of the ancient Mediterranean world, especially the ancient Mystery religions, Gnosticism, ancient cosmology, and early Christianity. He has taught a number of speculative courses such as the evolution of consciousness, archetypal psychology, alchemical symbolism, the metaphysics of cyberspace, and applied deep ecology. He has frequently lectured at the San Francisco C.G. Jung Institute. His book Mysteria, The Ancient Mysteries and the Evolution of Consciousness (forthcoming) is based on a series of lectures Ulansey presented at the San Francisco C.G. Jung Institute. Ulansey is currently (2012) completing a book called, The Other Christ: The Mysteries of Mithras and the Origins of Christianity. Mithraic experts who are opponents of Ulansey's ideas on the origin of Mithraism include Roger Beck, Manfred Clauss and Helmut Waldmann. Most book reviewers at the time of the book's publication shared an absence of critical ability to deal with the material. (However, Ulansey continually refers to supportive extracts from these reviews as though they were timelessly relevant.) That people devising a cult circa 50 CE would decide to represent in stone the arrangement of the constellations in 2000 BCE - not what people could actually see in the sky - lacks credibility. The fact that the precession of the equinoxes had been discovered is not relevant. See the (English-language) book reviews by Bartel van der Waerden in Journal for the History of Astronomy, Volume 21, 1990, Pages 365-366; by Anon in Scientific American, September, 1991, Volume 265, Number 3, Pages 136; by John Griffiths in The Classical Review, New Series, Volume 41, Number 1, 1991, Pages 122-124 (a critical review); by Alan Bowen in Isis, Volume 82, Number 2, June, 1991, Pages 359-360 (a critical review); and by Curtis Wilson in Ancient Philosophy, Spring, 1992, Volume XII, Number 1, Pages 242-244; and the (French-language) book review by (the French Egyptologist) Michel Malaise in Latomus, Tome 55, 1996, Pages 496-498. Also see "Gnostic Liberation from Astrological Determinism: Hipparchan "Trepidation" and the Breaking of Fate." by Horace Hodges (Vigiliae Christianae, Volume 51, Number 4, November, 1997, Pages 359-373) for the claim that at least some Gnostic sects used Hipparchus' discovery of the precession of the equinoxes as evidence of a benevolent force (a soteriological god) intervening in the world to successfully shift the zodiacal sphere to break the bonds of astrological fate and release the Gnostic elect from the power of the cosmos and its creator. On a personal note: In my experience David Ulansey is not always reliable with his explanation of issues; especially those relating to his critics. As example: on The Mithras List, March 6, 2005, Ulansey posted “It's also interesting that Gary Thompson says ... [on his website], "Most book reviewers [of Ulansey's book] share an absence of critical ability to deal with the material." What he really means by that, as became clear in the Sebshesen discussions, is simply that they do not agree with him!" This is simply fictional. On the Sebshesen list I was continually amazed by how evasive Ulansey could be and the manner in which he dealt with facts. This sort of evasion and distortion seems to be a typical Ulansey tactic to deal with critics. Ulansey does not like critics! What became clear in the Sebshesen discussion was the distortive and evasive tactics of Ulansey when (1) dealing with the evidence presented by critics, and (2) attempting to marshal evidence to support his particular views.
The Greek philosopher and polymath Aristotle (384-322 BCE) had never heard of precession. Using John Dreyer's History of the Planetary Systems from Thales to Kepler (1906) we find that in the Greek-Roman world precession was only mentioned by Hipparchus of Rhodes (circa 190-circa 120 BCE, Greek astronomer and mathematician), Claudius Ptolemy (Greek-Roman citizen and astronomer and mathematician, circa 100-circa 165 CE), Proclus Lycaeus (412-485 CE, a Greek Neoplatonic philosopher) who emphatically denied its existence, Theon of Alexandria (circa 335-405 CE, Greek mathematician and astronomer), and Origen Adamantius (184/185-253/254 CE, early Christian Alexandrian scholar and theologian). Interestingly, ancient astrologers were happy to use Ptolemy's astronomical tables (Handy Tables) but remained unconvinced by his observational demonstrations for the theory of precession. It is one thing to claim - as some writers do - precession was known by circa 200 CE and another to provide reasonable proof of the claim. On similar lack of evidence it can be claimed that precession was denied by the early fathers of the Church. Precession was not mentioned by Geminus of Rhodes (Greek astronomer and mathematician, flourished 1st-century BCE),



Cleomedes (flourished 1st-century CE, Greek (Stoic) philosopher and astronomer), Theon of Smyrna (circa 70-circa 135 CE, Greek philosopher and mathematician), Marcus Manilius (flourished 1st-century CE, Roman poet, astrologer, and author of a poem in five books called Astronomica), Pliny the Elder ((Gaius Plinius Secundus), 23-79 CE, Roman author, naturalist, and natural philosopher), Censorinus (flourished 3rd-century CE, Roman grammarian and miscellaneous writer), Achilles Tatius (flourished 3rd-century CE, Greek writer (referred to by Firmicus Maternus)), Chalcidius ((Calcidius) flourished 4th-century, Greek philosopher (possibly a Christian), Ambrosius Macrobius (flourished early 5thcentury CE, Roman scholar), and Martianius Capella (circa 365-circa 440 CE, Roman school teacher at Carthage).
In his 3-volume encyclopedic scientific work Kitab al-qanun al-Masudi, the Arab-Islamic polymath Al-Biruni (973-1048 CE) mentions those in his time who opposed the concept of precession and maintained the view that the fixed stars did not move at all.
Lack of evidence for advanced astronomy in Neolithic Mesopotamia
All the evidence recovered through archaeology shows:
(1) No advanced astronomy in Neolithic Mesopotamia.
(2) No equally spaced 12 division zodiac in Neolithic Mesopotamia.
(3) No concept of astronomical/zodiacal world ages in Neolithic Mesopotamia.
(4) No suggestion of an astronomical monomyth in Neolithic Mesopotamia.
(5) Multiple migratory waves of people into Mesopotamia affecting the existing culture.
Early Sumerian religion was not astral/planetary
There were no planetary gods/goddesses in the earliest Sumerian pantheon. The formal scheme involved An (sky), Enlil (storm), Ninhursaga (fertility), Enki (underground water), Nanna (moon), Utu (Sun), Ereshkigal (underworld), Ezen (grain), etc. It was only much later that the 5 planets were named after gods/goddesses, whose origin had nothing to do with the planets (3 were borrowed from local solar gods): Nergal (Mars), Marduk (Jupiter), and Ninurta (Saturn). Inanna was a rival to the Sumerian earth goddess Ninhursaga who eventually became dominant and associated with Venus. According to the sumerologist Thorkild Jacobsen (The Encyclopedia of Religion edited by Mircea Eliade (1987, Volume 9, Page 451)), "At Uruk - in antiquity as today a center of date culture - there was [Dumuzi-]Amaushumgalana, the power for animal growth and new life of the date palm, and his consort Inanna, earlier Ninana ("mistress of the date clusters")."
Morris Jastrow's numerous publications on Babylonian religion indicate that the association of gods/goddesses with planets was basically arbitrary and also a late development. According to Morris Jastrow (Aspects of Religious Belief and Practice in Babylonia (1911): "The Conception of a god of heaven [i.e., Anu] fits in, moreover, with the comparatively advanced period when the seats of the gods were placed in the skies, and the gods identified with the stars. Such an astral theology, however, is not a part of the earlier religious beliefs of the Babylonians ...." This is supported by more recent scholarship. William Fulco (The Encyclopedia of Religion edited by Mircea Eliade (1987, Volume 7, Page 82, see also Page 145)) writes: "Comparative Semitic evidence suggests that the Akkadian Venus deity was originally masculine but became completely feminized when identified with the female Sumerian deity Inanna. Because of the eventual syncretism of the Sumerian and Akkadian pantheons, the traditions concerning Inanna-Ishtar are extremely complicated. By one such tradition she is the daughter of the sky god An, by another the daughter of the moon god Nanna-Sin (and thereby sister of the sun god Utu-Shamash), and by still another, the daughter of Enlil or Ashur"
By circa the mid-3rd-millennium BCE the Sumerian pantheon (later adopted by the Babylonians) was structured with 2 superior triads over the body of lesser gods dominated by those with planetary associations (due to their importance in omenology). These are listed as follows with their sacred (harmonic?) number (often used as the name of the god/goddess) when known in parentheses: 1: An (60), Enlil (50), Enki (40); 2: Nanna (30), Utu (20), Inanna (15); and 3: Ninurta (50), Marduk (10 - changed to 50 by the Babylonians), Neral (12, later 14), Nabu (?), Adad (10), etc. To the Babylonians, the 2 superior triads were: (1) Anu, Enlil, and Ea; and (2) Sin, Shamash, and Ishtar. An/Anu was the overall head of the pantheon with Enlil (and later Marduk, the patron god of Babylon, when it attained political domination of Mesopotamia) being the next most powerful. (Marduk played no important role in the earliest periods of Babylonian history.) To the Assyrians, Ashur, patron deity of Ashur, was the overall head of the pantheon (otherwise it closely resembled the pantheon of Babylon).
Part 8: An Alternative Explanation for the Mythology of Hamlet's Mill
For de Santillana and von Dechend the main source of myth was astronomy. For Ernest McClain, The Myth of Invariance, the main source is music. McClain argues that the connections between music (pre-Pythagorean mathematical/musical theories) and myth/traditions are much deeper than any connections between astronomy and myth. In attempts to understand mythology the ideas (convincing reinterpretation) of McClain must be considered. In antiquity musical symbolism was understood by all educated persons. There are 2 types of apparent invariances in the natural world that are perceptible by the human senses: astronomical recurrences (i.e., the solar year) and harmonic intervals. In adopting a musical approach to myth McClain was influenced by Antonio de Nicholas in his book Meditations Through the Rg Veda: Four Dimensional Man (2003). De Nicholas stressed harmonic invariance. Spanish-born Antonio de Nicolas was educated in Spain, India and the United States, and received his Ph.D. in philosophy at Fordham University in New York. He received his spiritual training, and his education in the Greek and Latin classics at the 12th-century Monastery of Santa Maria de Veruela in Northern Spain. He is Professor Emeritus of philosophy at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. De Nicholas has persuasively demonstrated that so-called 'precessional number' are uniquely matched to acoustical arithmetic, rather than to 'precessional arithmetic.' Hipparchus stated that "Geometry is frozen music."
Ernest McClain (1918-2014) is widely known for his efforts to establish the ancient mathematical discipline of music as the means to unlock the inner meaning of history's great religious and philosophical texts. After receiving a doctorate from Teachers College, Columbia University, he joined the Music Faculty of Brooklyn College (part of the City University of New York in 1951, where he taught until his retirement in 1982. Ernest G. McClain is currently (2012) Professor Emeritus at Brooklyn College. He is also a clarinetist. McClain has been retired since 1982 and currently lives in Washington. His persuasive (but ultimately imaginative and suggestive reconstructions from epigraphic evidence) explanations of crucial passages in texts of world literature – the Bible, the Rig Veda, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and Plato – that deal with numbers, are quite complex. However, he is able to explain the meaning of these numbers within the context of four ancient mathematical disciplines: arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy. His explanation embraces identical or similar numbers and parallel mathematical constructs in ancient Sumer, Egypt, Babylon, Palestine and Greece.
According to Ernest McClain the relationship of music and numbers to ancient cosmology may go back as far as the Neolithic period of Mesopotamia, India, and China. A snippet from The New York Times, April 23, 1987: Critic’s Notebook; Magic, Music and Math: "Modern



authors, notably Ernest G. McClain in his books ''The Myth of Invariance'' and ''The Pythagorean Plato,'' have argued persuasively that the ancient Babylonians, Hindus, Egyptians and Greeks developed elaborate traditions of tonal symbolism. Phenomena such as harmonic resonances and the tempering of musical scales were related to observations of biological and astronomical cycles. The plotting of these cycles, and the urge to embody them in sound as well as express them in equations, helped spur the development of both music and mathematics."
Both de Santillana and McClain specify the origins of numbers based myths in the Neolithic Period. McClain interprets numbers in mythology, not as astronomical as was done in Hamlet's Mill, but to the mathematics of acoustics and tuning theory. Part of a 2006 book review on Amazon.com by Mark Rankin: "His work delves into the lost connections between the musical/mathematical/cosmological theories of the ancient world and the philosophies of the ancient Greeks, the ancient Hebrews, the ancient Hindus, and the ancient Babylonians. In our modern world we use our highest technology to find a unified field "theory of everything". The ancients were no different, except that they used their highest technology to find a "theory of everything" that was based on musical tuning, an ancient sort of "string theory"."
McClain credits colleagues Ernst Levy and Siegmund Levarie and their writings (including, A Theory of Harmony (1985 (by Ernst Levy and edited by Siegmund Levarie)) for introducing him to Pythagoreanism via the insights of 19th century theorist Albert von Thimus, who provided the keys to unlocking Plato's mathematical riddles. McClain’s 3 books were published during a decade of collaboration with the Spanish scholar Antonio de Nicolas. This collaboration opened a window into other ancient philosophical and religious writings. An important article published in the early 1970s was "Plato's Musical Cosmology," and "Musical Marriages in Plato's Republic." Albert von Thimus (1806-1878), the Gentian lawyer, philologist, and musical scholar is considered one of the most outstanding modern thinkers on the metaphysical aspects of harmony. In his long forgotten (small) book, Die harmonikale Symbolik des Alterthums: Zwei Abteilungen (1870; reprinted 1988), Albert von Thimus, a polymath and indefatigable researcher into ancient harmonic theory called attention to many arithmetical and graphical structures in the tonal imagery of the ancient world.
For a discussion of McClain’s ideas see: Beyond Measure (2002) by Jay Kappraff; Harmonies of Heaven and Earth (1987) by Joscelyn Godwin; and, The Shape of Ancient Thought (2002) by Thomas Evilley. See also the importance article: "Music as Basic Metaphor and Deep Structure in Plato and in Ancient Cultures." by Patrick Heelan S.J. in (the now defunct) Journal of Social and Biological Structures, Volume 2, Number 4, Pages 279-291).
De Santillana and von Dechend posit the Early Neolithic and McClain posits the Late Neolithic. De Santillana and McClain share an interest in Pythagoreanism. McClain's book title The Myth of Invariance is based on a statement by de Santillana in his introduction to Hamlet's Mill.
In a posting to talk.origins (8 August, 1994) Leroy Ellenberger writes: "... the implicit imprimatur they [de Santillana and von Dechend, Hamlet's Mill] give McClain's approach. ... [D]e Santillana allows: "Mathematics was moving up to me from the depth of centuries; not after myth, but before it ... *Number* gave the key [emphasis added]. ... [T]he list of world-class scholars who are *interested* in McClains's insights includes: H. von Dechend (Frankfort), H.A.T. Reiche (M.I.T ...), S. Parpola (Helsinki) and A.D. Kilmer (Berkeley). ... [According to] McClain's work, the harmonic numerology of the Sumerians is model-drive and proceeds from 30-60 and 360-720 "octaves" to larger bases in order to achieve better whole number fraction approximations to the irrational ratios that inhabit the octave, especially the square root of two that harmonically bisects it." This account is contrary to McClain's recollection. McClain is quite clear that neither Hertha von Dechend or Harald Reiche showed any real interest in, or attempt to understand, his ideas. Neither did they incorporate them into their own work.
Wandering myths
Audley-Miller, Lucy. and Dignas, Beate. (Editors). (2018). Wandering Myths: Transcultural Uses of Myth in the Ancient World. Publisher description: "In spite of the growing amount of important new work being carried out on uses of myth in particular ancient contexts, their appeal and reception beyond the framework of one culture have rarely been the primary object of enquiry in contemporary debate. Highlighting the fact that ancient societies were linked by their shared use of mythological narratives, Wandering Myths aims to advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which such tales were disseminated cross-culturally and to investigate how they gained local resonances. In order to assess both wider geographic circulations and to explore specific local features and interpretations, a regional approach is adopted, with a particular focus on Anatolia, the Near East and Italy. Contributions are drawn from a range of disciplines, and cross a wide chronological span, but all are interlinked by their engagement with questions focusing on the factors that guided the processes of reception and steered the facets of local interpretation. The Preface and Epilogue evaluate the material in a synoptic way and frame the challenging questions and views expressed in the Introduction."
Part 9: Some Book Review Critics and Criticisms
Hamlet's Mill has been described as "subjective exegesis." Properly, exegesis is the careful investigation of the original meaning of texts in their historical and literary contexts. It involves critical analysis, interpretation and explanation. There are solid reasons to conclude the authors fail to accurately interpret the meaning of texts. Their mode of argument fosters a misleading view of mythology. Hamlet's Mill tries to claim authority when in fact it has none. Numerous supporters of Hamlet's Mill readily engage in 'word smithing' exercises to try and 'work around' the informed criticisms of the book.
Reviewers like Edmund Leach, Jaan Puhvel, Lynn White Junior, Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, Geoffrey Kirk, and Hilda Davidson are recognised authorities in their own different fields, and none has been shown to have an 'axe to grind.' Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin was not only a brilliant astronomer but had command of other subject areas also. These independent reviewers assess Hamlet's Mill from different perspectives, and all the reviewers make strong and decisive criticisms. The picture of Hamlet's Mill that emerges is that of a book that is both out-of-date and completely one-sided in its approach, full of errors of fact and interpretation, and a book that seems to have been hastily and carelessly put together with little attention to proper analyses. The points made by the reviewers cannot simply be dismissed; they are substantial and detailed, and put the entire set of conclusions in Hamlet's Mill into doubt. Hamlet's Mill is not an authoritative reference on understanding world mythology. Its over-emphasis on a supposed underpinning archaic astrology is without merit. Interestingly, the only rebuttal to the content of any of these reviews is a short 1970 protest letter to the New York Review of Books by de Santillana basically stating that he didn't like Leach's book review and he didn't approve of Leach being chosen as book reviewer. De Santillana also stated that writing Hamlet's Mill "involved ten years of specific studies in technical astronomy, ancient and archaeological history and myth." The editor of the New York Review of Books stood by Leach as a competent reviewer for the book.
(1) Some summary points in the book review by Edmund Leach [Anthropologist] in The New York Review (of Books), February 12, 1970, Page 36:
"[T]he murky confusion generated by reading any random twenty pages of Hamlet's Mill is strongly reminiscent of Frobenius. Indeed, the whole operation is not much more than a gloss on two early works of the extraordinary author, Die Mathematik der Oceaner (1900) and Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes (1904)."



"Whether any such cosmic legend ever existed anywhere at all, all in one piece, seems, on the evidence of this book, to be extremely doubtful, but those who want to believe in such improbabilities as flying saucers are never likely to be put off by mere lack of evidence."
"The whole enterprise is rather like a demonstration that Francis Bacon wrote the plays of William Shakespeare. Provided you are certain of your answers before you start, the clues and acrostics can be found almost anywhere."
"Something like 60 percent of the text is made up of complex arguments about Indo-European etymologies which would have seemed oldfashioned as early as 1870."
"It was proposed by Kuhn in 1852 that the name Prometheus is a corruption of Sanskrit Pra-mantha, a fire stick. Although this etymology has long ago been completely rejected as linguistically quite impossible ... Hamlet's Mill not only resurrects the equation but gives it enormous elaboration so that Prometheus's fall from celestial grace is made to provide evidence that our ancestors of 6000 years ago could recognize a shifting in the position of the Pole Star!"
"But the skeptic need never feel browbeaten by the battery of foot-notes and appendices. Half the time the authors get their references wrong anyway. For example, at p. 142 they blandly assert that "during the last hundred years it has been taken for granted that no one could have detected the Precession (of the Equinoxes) prior to Hipparchus's alleged discovery of the phenomenon in 127 B.C.," and they then go on to argue that evidence of a much earlier understanding of the phenomenon is to be found in ancient mythology. But this is just false. The issue has been discussed repeatedly ...."
(2) Some summary points in the book review by Jaan Puhvel [Philologist/Historian] in The American Historical Review, Volume LXXV, Number 6, October, 1970, Pages 2009-2010:
"[The authors set out to prove that] ... myth is a repository of arcane astronomical (and astrological) knowledge .... This the authors do by a combination of heavy scholarship, withering hubristic polemicism, and portentous oracular style."
"The long-forgotten period-piece etymologies of Max Müller and Adalbert Kuhn ("surely a great scholar," p. 381) are blithely resurrected (for example, Sanskrit Pramantha matching Greek Prometheus, p. 139), while more up-to-date authorities are caricatured as "severe philologists, slaves to exact 'truth' (p. 294)."
"In brief this is not a serious scholarly work on the problem of myth in the closing decades of the twentieth century."
(3) Some summary points in the book review by Lynn White Junior [Historian] in Isis, Volume 61, 1970, Pages 540-541:
:"In his preface (p. x) de Santillana expresses admiration for von Dechend's virtue of "scornful indignation." "Arrogant oversimplification" might be an equivalent phrase."
"Von Dechend assumes a single astronomical origin in the Near East for the entire global corpus of mythologies. Her only proofs are analogy, often strained. On a single page (425) she connects myths of Greece, Japan, Egypt, Iceland, the Marquesas, and the Cherokee Indians. On page 309, a rabbinical and a Pawnee tradition show "unmistakeable" identity. On page 320 we read "here Greek myth suddenly emerges in full light among Indian tribes in America, miraculously preserved." One might quote such passages indefinitely."
"The Norse hero Amlodhi had a great quern in the sea where Nine Maids ground out his meal. In his classic Hamlet in Iceland Sir Israel Gollanz concluded that "Hamlet's Mill" may mean anything."
"But admitting that drills and churns offer a possible symbolism of the retrograde parts of the observed paths of the planets, anyone who has operated a fire drill or churn knows that the alterations in directions of rotation are necessarily so swift that to turn them into symbols of the solemn wheeling of the heavenly bodies is a psychological absurdity."
(4) Some summary points in the book review by Gerald Gresseth [Philologist/Classicist] in Journal of American Folklore, Volume 84, Number 332, April/June, 1971, Pages 246-247:
"[I]t does not appear (the authors never say) why this information had to be encoded in myth - and not in simple asterisms, at that, but in complex myths that on the surface at least would seem to have no reference to even the stars, let alone the precession."
"[T]his theory precludes, in accordance with its own criteria, any way of accounting for the variants and combinations of motifs in any one myth type (Flood myth for example). One feature of Flood myths is the suddenness of the flood - hardly in keeping with the precessional motion of the earth."
"Even granting that this ancient "brains trust" did encode such knowledge in myth, how does it happen that the code was so completely lost that even the learned do not know it, though these same societies managed to hand down other types of information well enough?"
"[T]here seems to be no other record other than the code of the myth for this important astronomical knowledge."
"[T]here is no attempt in the book to demonstrate how this astronomical information was diffused in myth from the ancient Near East to North America, Polynesia, and other parts of the world."
"There is much else that folklorists would like to have the authors explain. For instance, did these ancient thinkers use already existing myths to encode their discoveries in? If so, what was the origin of these myths?"
(5) Some summary points in the book review by Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin [Astronomer] in Journal for the History of Astronomy, Volume 3, 1972, Pages 206-211:
"[T]he threads of the argument are not closely knit. Rather they are loosely braided, and the final pattern does not leap to the eye. I tried without success to reproduce the development of the theme by writing a brief paragraph to summarize each chapter." [Note: This is an extremely strong point. Do what Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin did and try to make a summary of each chapter. It leads nowhere! Obviously the authors could not recall Cicero's praise of Caesar's Commentaries: "There is nothing ... more attractive than clean lucid brevity." The authors of Hamlet's Mill are neither succinct nor understandable. Their argument in places is both polemical and rhetorical and also their exposition is basically superficial - no convincing evidence is offered.]



"Much of the book will be unfamiliar to anyone save an extremely well-read specialist. The flamboyant and allusive style serves only to deepen the obscurity. Why should the reader be expected to recognise allusions to The possessed, or Mabinogion, or Flaubert's unfinished satirical novel? Why should he be bewildered by a punning reference to quasars? What is he to make of the author's comment on Nonnos: "It takes some nerve to say of the Galaxy that it meanders - actually the Greek text has it that it moves in a helix"; for that is exactly what it does, and perhaps Nonnos was announcing a proleptic discovery of galactic rotation."
"The minor evidences of carelessness [on the part of the authors] suggest a certain insouciance in composition, and impose ... the problem of examining the book's fidelity to its sources."
"The treatment of classical mythology and its derivatives seems to be needlessly obscure, and (as the authors remark of Eisler) "provides more information than guidance.""
"The "good reason to assume" an earlier discovery [of precession to Hipparchus] must rest on the idea that it was likely. It is argued that "our ancestors ... were endowed with minds wholly comparable to ours", therefore they were capable, "always given the means at hand", of perceiving Precession. They may have done so; it is notoriously difficult to prove a negative. But to use the myths as evidence that they did, and then to use this conclusion to interpret the myths, smacks of a circular argument."
"The Zodiac forms a sort of backdrop to the drama, but it falls somewhat out of focus. Yet the origin of the zodiacal constellations seems to lie at the heart of the mystery. We could wish that the book included a documentation of this fascinating subject. The authors glance at a few details .... But they claim that they "must not be drowned in the abyss of details of comparative constellation lore." In other words they do not consider the history of the constellations as important a subject as others to which they devote massive documentation. It is in fact a question of which abyss you choose."
(6) Some summary points in the book review by Albert Friedman [Folklorist/Historian] in Journal of the History of Philosophy, Volume X, Number 4, October 1972, Page 479 [also given as pages 479-480]:
"The authors, both seasoned historians of science, have concocted a book that reads like Velikovsky bouncing along the Road to Xanadu."
"This archaic astronomical monomyth, diffused from China to Peru, no longer exists in its pristine integrity but has to be painfully teased out of the flotsam and jetsam that surfaces sporadically in chronicles, epics and latter-day literary myths, and it is to this task that the authors address themselves. The result is unconvincing."
"Erudite references are heaped together with too little attention to designing a credible argument; tenuous associations are passed off as sensational and indubitable proofs; their is much sleight-of-hand with entymologies; passages in epics are eccentrically explicated to yield the desired interpretation."
"But what is most exasperating about the book is the author's coy way of paying out their findings. Just as a train of argument is about to come to the point, a digression is maddeningly introduced to heighten the suspense; the startling promises of topic sentences and paragraphs somehow never get realized in the tangle of forced facts and dubious speculations that follow."
"[N]ow and then an arresting idea emerges, but these tidbits hardly compensate for the frailty of the thesis and the overly calculated exposition."
Brief book review by Albert Friedman in Journal of the History of Philosophy, Volume X, 1972, Page 479.
(7) Some summary points in the book review by Geoffrey Kirk [Classicist] in The Spectator, Volume 225, Part 2, Number 7434, 19 December, 1970, Page [220?] 809:
"This imaginative and perverse volume represents a further installment of a vision developed over the past twenty years within the improbable portals of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."
"The ... theory is that world mythology contains relics of a lost archaic belief that world-ages succeed one another in accord with the precession of the equinoxes, an idea [held] familiar several millennia before Hipparchus. This remarkable and improbable conclusion is presented in language that is mystical and apocalyptic as much as vague and dogmatic: 'mathematics was moving up to me from the depth of centuries'."
"The basic intuition about a vast but fugue-like corpus of ancient astronomical knowledge is very loosely supported by reference to the Pythagoreans and Plato, to number-imagery in the Vedas, to the Avesta, to Gilgamesh and other Mesopotamian figures, and to the northern tales of Hamlet that give the book its title. Amlodhi in Norse legend owned a mill that ground out peace and prosperity; later it degenerated to producing salt; ultimately, at the bottom of the sea, it produces mere rock and sand and is the source of the Maelstrom, one of the entrances of the underworld: 'This imagery stands, as the evidence develops, for an astronomical process, the secular shifting of the sun through the signs of the zodiac which determines world-ages ...'."
"The chaotic presentation of the argument is defended by reference to the 'non-catenary' nature of the archaic structure of ideas it seeks to disclose."
"The style in which these ideas are presented varies from the imprecise and pretentious (Socrates's 'inimitable' habit of using myth for the discussion of serious matters) to the absurd ('The epics of Gilgamesh and Era offer too many trees for our modest demands.')."
"More serious, there is virtually nothing in the way of cogent argument. Even in the appendices where the texture of thought appears least diffuse, it is rare to find two propositions of which it may be said that the one follows necessarily or even probably from the other."
"Yet at the points where I was qualified to test it the information the information was either inaccurate or wilfully interpreted: something that the authors, who defy 'experts' and the like, would obviously not accept."
(8) Some summary points in the book review by Hilda Davidson [Folklorist/Historian] in Folklore, Volume CXXXV, 1974, Pages 282-283:
"It is assumed, although the evidence of the Dogon in Africa (quoted in Appendix L) would seem to contradict it. that the general system of astronomy must always follow the same fundamental lines among early and preliterate people."
"[The book] ... is amateurish in the worst sense, jumping to wild conclusions without any knowledge of the historical value of the sources or of previous work done."



"On the Scandinavian side there is heavy dependence on the fantasies of Rydberg, writing in the last century, and apparent ignorance of progress made since his time."
"No one can take seriously an elaborate theory based on an extremely obscure and imperfectly preserved passage of skaldic verse, relying on one translation, that of Gollanz."
"It is nonsense to state (p. 26) that the culture of the Finno-Ugric peoples was utterly cut off from the Scandinavians until recently: and one might continue on these lines indefinitely."
"[The book] ... attempts to dogmatize in fields in which the authors are not sufficiently at home."
(9) Some summary points in the book review by David Leeming [Folklorist] in Parabola, Volume III, Issue 1, 1978, Pages 113-115:
"The book seems to ... be an attempt to prove a pet theory, to the exclusion of others equally valid."
"[T]he authors appear to be blinded by their own voluminous scholarship; their extensive footnotes, appendices, and tangential meanderings most of the time bury whatever it is they are trying to say. In fact, Hamlet's Mill reads like a parody of nineteenth century scholarship of the German variety. For all its pretensions to freshness and originality, it is ... one of the most muddled books yet written on the subject of myth."
"Hamlet's Mill is, finally, fantasy, but it is too top-heavy to enjoy. ... The problem is, Santillana and von Dechend try to prove a nearly exclusive connection by means of a parade of loosely related information. This is the rationalist fallacy. Give me a theory - especially one as wild as this and with enough mythic material I can "prove" it, simply because there are so many mythic "facts" to draw from."
(10) Some summary points in the (favourable) book review by Carroll Quigley [Historian] in The Washington Sunday Star, 25 January, 1970:
"[T]his volume is ... badly organized and badly written. The main arguments should have been clearly stated at the outset, and the evidence including that derived from folklore, should then have been mobilized to support the arguments. Instead the arguments only emerge by implication, and not in the early chapters, where they are buried and confused by a flood of stories from worldwide folklore fragments."
"[T]he purpose of the book is largely defeated, not by its scholarship but by its confused presentation. ... The chapter headings and the language of the text are similarly allusive and poetical. But a scientific argument has to be written in the clearest prose possible, with the thesis presented and precision. No theses such as these can emerge by implication nor be proved by even the most copious cumulation of ambiguous stories from folklore."
"There is a second weakness in this volume: its authors are so obsessed with the precession of the equinoxes that they refuse to see that primitive thinkers had other worries. ... In this they are in grave error and simply reveal their inability to get inside the minds of archaic men."

(11) Article critique by Frederic [Frederick] Amory:
A neglected/forgotten (English-language) critique of Hamlet's Mill is: Amory, Frederick [Frederic] (1925-2009). (1977). "The Medieval Hamlet: A Lesson in the Use and Abuse of a Myth." (Deutsche Vierteljahresschrift für Literaturwissenschaft und Geistesgeschichte, Volume 51, Number 3, September, Pages 357-395). [Note: Includes 123 references. Abstract: I. Réfutation de l'interprétation cosmologique donnée par G. deSantillana et H. von Dechend (Hamlet's Mill, 1969) de l'histoire d'H. Le moulin magique dans les mythologies nordiques et scandinaves, dans le folklore, la religion germanique, et les épopées nordiques. II. L'A. considère Hamlet comme le personnage du fourbe décrit par Lévī-Strauss dont la fourberie résoud dans un mythe un cas d'inceste. L'Hamlet de Saxo Grammaticus: sources irlandaises et islandaises, diverses formes de la légende. Son achèvement chez Shakespeare. At the time of his death Frederic Amory was Emeritus Professor of English at the University of San Francisco, San Francisco. He was trained in the graduate schools of Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley, in comparative and interdisciplinary ethnography.] A sample of Amory's informed critique: "The methodology of Hamlet's Mill is uninfluenced by the structuralism of Lévī-Strauss, or the comparative methods of Dumézil, but the authors, nevertheless, should not have entrenched themselves in nineteenth century German scholarship against the newer French schools of linguistics, mythography, and anthropology (Griaule's group of Africanists excepted), for they have perpetuated through their dependence on that scholarship many ancient and ridiculous errors of fact and interpretations, and they have never faced up to the crucial dilemma before the "science of myth" - how to reconcile the mythmaking propensity with the sympathetic investigation of myths - which Lévī-Strauss seized so boldly by the horns in the preface to the first volume of his Mythologiques (1964)."
Note: Philological comparative mythology (claiming that all comparative mythology must rest on comparison of names as its most certain basis) seemed securely established in the late 19th-century but after acceptance for several decades was shown to be untenable. See the interesting contemporary discussion in Modern Mythology by Andrew Lang (1897). In the 19th-century Andrew Lang criticised the notion that myths could be easily compared through merely textual methods and showed that the philological approach to mythology by Muller and Schmidt was unreliable, being merely a form of armchair anthropology. The belief that the outdated and flawed philological approach adopted by de Santillana and von Dechend trumps all modern scholars/scholarship is patently absurd. The philology which was developed in the 19th-century qualifies as a pseudo-science. The way languages work makes mere resemblance between words in different languages deceptive. "Linguistic history is full of amazing parallels, like Latin habeo and German habe, identical in meaning, which cannot possibly be related." (The Mycenaean World by John Chadwick (1976, Page 87).)

(12) The book reviews by Harald Reiche and Philip Morrison
Harald Reiche was one of the few academics to positively review Hamlet's Mill. For some reason it was signed "Harald A. T. Reiche, Oxford." Oxford University is the oldest university in the English-speaking world. Harald Reiche (1922–1994) was a German-American classical scholar, specialising in an astronomical interpretation of Greek mythology. However, Reiche spent his career at MIT, was a close friend of both de Santillana and von Dechend, and supported their ideas. It is rather disingenuous for him to to give his address as "Oxford" rather than "MIT." I cannot find anything academically that would link him to Oxford other than a publishing company. However, one of his daughters, Elizabeth, studied in Oxford, England. Perhaps a social visit was in place when he wrote the book review. Regardless, it implies that he wanted to avoid making it clear that he was a colleague of de Santillana and von Dechend, and greatly admired the book. Also, his broad address should have been given as MIT. This needs to be taken into account when reading his book review. Whether real or apparent, Reiche had a conflict of interest. The review by Philip Morrison (a Professor at MIT and a friend of de Santillana and von Dechend) was rather a non-review which did not explain much and which did not address any of the problems that had been identified by other reviewers. Philip Morrison's book review seems to be an attempt to put the best face on it and not be too critical. Also, as Philip Morrison had no expertise in the particular fields not much weight can be given to his book review. Obviously both Reiche and Morrison were trying to do the book's authors a favour. There was obviously a "buddy system" in place at MIT. The fact of some journals choosing book reviewers from the same institution as the authors of the book is somewhat odd.
(13) Extract from a review of Hamlet's Mill from Society for Interdisciplinary Studies Review, Volume II, Number 4, Spring, 1978
"Hamlet's Mill is, one must admit, a heavy book, both physically and metaphorically .... Such a formidable presentation need not of itself form a barrier to the general reader, but sadly it must be said that the authors (both of whom were, at the time of writing the book, Professors of the History of Science, one in America and one in Germany) [von Dechend was not a historian of science as it is understood] have not succeeded in putting over their arguments or conclusions clearly. Far too often they resort to hints, allusions or throwaway questions, so that the threads of reasoning become even more tangled than necessary." [Von Dechend's eventual title was "Professor of History of Science, Ancient Cosmology," likely based on her supposed knowledge of precessional mythology. She had no wide knowledge/expertise on the history of science.]
Part 10: Some Corrections
Some corrections and additions to the original English-language edition of Hamlet's Mill:
Page xvii: The Royal Art of Astronomy = The Royal Art of Astrology.
Page xi: Quote is incorrectly attributed to Troilus instead of Pandarus.
Page 7: 9 X 13 = 9 X 12. (This misprint has caused some people to conclude they were thinking of ancient Mesoamerican traditions about nine heavens and thirteen underworlds; 9 X 13 = 117 (which has nothing to do with precession). In his review of Hamlet's Mill (The Classical Journal, Volume 69, Number 1, 1973, Pages 81-83; Harald Reiche identified 9 x 13 as a misprint for 9 x 12.)
Page 34: Shakespeare's Hamlet is misquoted.
Page 69: raciation = ratiocination.
Page 137: Shakespeare's Hamlet is misquoted.
Page 139: appendix #15 = appendix #14.
Page 142: The reference to Hipparchus' discovery that the north pole turns about the ecliptic pole should be reworded to avoid creating the impression that the discovery of the latter was a consequence of the discovery of the phenomenon of precession. It is the obliquity of the ecliptic itself, i.e., the solar year, which implies an ecliptic pole distinct from the north pole.
Illustrations between pages 142-143: The figure legends (captions) on each page have been interchanged. (First USA edition only; corrected in later editions.)
Page 163: alternative = alternating.
Page 197: Heliand = Heiland. (But Rodger Cunningham kindly brought to my attention that Heliand is the correct Old Saxon form as the authors seem to be referring obliquely to the medieval poem of that title.)
Page 197: Pier della Vigna = Pier delle Vigne or Petro della Vigna. (Kindly brought to my attention by Roger Cunningham.)
Page 211: Red Sea = Persian Gulf.
Page 242: Johannes = Johannis.
Page 338: Tennyson's verse is misquoted.
Page 349: St. Cecelia's Day = St. Cecilia's Day.
Page 367: Appendix 9 has no page (text) reference but page 93, line 3 is most likely intended.
Page 377: Paradise Lost, 10 = Paradise Lost, 9.
Page 380: alternative = alternating.
Page 389: oscillating = alternating.
Page 409: mission = mansions.



Page 427: Appendix 37 has no page (text) reference but page 319 or 320 is most likely intended.
Page ?: Lysis (by Plato (a dialogue on friendship) circa 380 BCE) instead of Lysias (Greek speech writer and story teller (life dates: circa 445-380 BCE)).
Note: The brief errata list that was enclosed with the 1993 German-language edition (by Hertha von Dechend) was left out of the 1994 reprint of such.
Corrections for the German-language edition:
Missed is correction of 1950 instead of 1959 on page 649, for publication date of Gössmann's Planetarium Babylonicum.
Correlation of appendices and page numbers in the original English-language edition of Hamlet's Mill:
There is a slight confusion with several of them as they appear in the book. In some cases multiple pages can be inferred.
Appendix 1 page 353 connects with pages 9, 320, 409, and see page 354.
Appendix 2 page 354 connects with pages 12, 87, 320, 409.
Appendix 3 page 360 connects with page 78.
Appendix 4 page 360 connects with pages 80, 409, 410, 444.
Appendix 5 page 360 connects with page 87.
Appendix 6 page 364 connects with page 89.
Appendix 7 page 365 connects with page 90.
Appendix 8 page 366 connects with page 92.
Appendix 9 page 367 connects with page ? No page (text) mention/reference readily identifiable - but see page 93, line 3? In the later Germanlanguage edition Appendix 9 connects with page 131 within the chapter on Amlodhi's Mill [Quern] = page 92 of English-language edition, which references Appendix 8.
Appendix 10 page 368 connects with page 104.
Appendix 11 page 370 connects with page 129.
Appendix 12 page 373 connects with pages 135, 152.
Appendix 13 page 377 connects with page 135.
Appendix 14 page 377 likely connects with page 139? but not referred to on that page or elsewhere. In the later German language edition Appendix 14 material is now numbered Appendix 15 and Appendix 15 connects with page 557 with in the new material comprising the new Appendix 14.
Appendix 15 page 383 connects with page 139, 141.
Appendix 16 page 386 connects with page 158.
Appendix 17 page 387 connects with page 173.
Appendix 18 page 390 connects with page 175.
Appendix 19 page 391 connects with pages 166, 228, and see page 430.
Appendix 20 page 396 connects with page 249.
Appendix 21 page 397 connects with page 262, and see page 249?.

Appendix 35 page 422 connects with page 302.
Appendix 36 page 422 connects with page 303.
Appendix 37 page 427 likely connects with page 319?, and see page 320?, but not referred to on those pages or elsewhere. In the later German language edition Appendix 37 material is now numbered Appendix 43 and Appendix 43 connects with page 449 within the chapter on Gilgamesh and Prometheus = page 319 of English-language edition, which is without any reference to an Appendix.
Appendix 38 page 428 connects with page 322.
Appendix 39 page 430 Excursus on Gilgamesh connects with pages 396, 410. In the later German language edition Appendix 37 material is now numbered Appendix 45. Note: It appears that a 1968 manuscript of a lecture on Gilgamesh by Hertha von Dechend is held by the FrobeniusInstitiute Frankfurt am Main.
Note: Dates of publication of references in the appendices indicate that many of the appendices were written - or at least rewritten - in the 1960s.
Regarding: Excursus on Gilgamesh
The lengthy 22-page discussion comprising this appendix has not changed between the original edition (1969) and the German-language edition (1993). There has been no attempt to update either the discussion or the references used. Even the dated and inaccurate translations remain. No reference is later than 1967. The majority of the numerous references precede 1950. It is easy to believe that this is because von Dechend has constructed the argument she wanted and wished it to remain. It brings into question just exactly how von Dechend viewed the process of revision.
Part 11: Some Books/Articles Preceding/Influencing Hamlet's Mill
Hamlet's Mill is unoriginal. It is derivative in that it is heavily influenced by Panbabylonism.
The common writing style for the era of this material is a lack of clear distinction between opinion and incontrovertible fact, something which is no longer acceptable in scholarly works. Claims by 19th-century investigators (academic and amateur) to finding the same myth or myths all over the world were not unusual. The 19th-century comparative mythologist Edwin Hartland found versions of what he thought were elements of the Perseus myth located everywhere on Earth and concluded that they must date back to prehistoric times. (The Legend of Perseus by Edwin Hartland ( 3 Volumes, 1894-1896).) Andrew Lang, a 19th-century journalist/writer with an interest in comparative mythology, claimed that Polynesian mythology was derived from Greek mythology. Lang claimed that a Samoan myth preserved a version of the Greek myth of Jason (and the Argonauts). (He also identified the Greek myth of Jason in an Algonquin myth.) Andrew Lang claimed that early mariners had diffused the story around the world. This type of claim derives from Victorian ideas of race which held that the Aryan peoples (the Indo-Europeans) were the apex of civilization, and all other peoples were culturally undeveloped.
L'Histoire générale et particulière des religions et du Culte (1791) by François Henri Stanislas Delaunaye (1739-1830). There was a 16 page prospectus published. An attempt to establish the foundation of religion in astral worship. Proposed the theory that religion and astronomy had common origins. Delaunaye set out for the first time a complete theory of history in which astronomical, and therefore religious, iconography, evolved with the precession of the equinoxes. Delaunaye followed Bailly and Dupuis in linking the evolution of religious forms to the precession of zodiac signs over the vernal point and, as a direct consequence, the sun's position against the background of the stars at the spring equinox.
The Devil’s Pulpit: or Astro-Theological Sermons by Robert Taylor (1831-1832, 2 volumes; numerous reprints). Reverend Robert Taylor (17841844), was an early 19th-century English radical, a clergyman turned freethinker. Reverend Taylor was originally a doctor who then became a minister in the Church of England. His lectures as a radical freethinker (given with him dressed in priestly robes) earned him the title "The Devil's Chaplain." The book is a collection of sermons delivered by the Reverend Robert Taylor. The book is a curiosity and remains an uninformed astronomical interpretation of the Bible.
Anacalypsis: An Attempt to Draw Aside the Veil of the Saitic Isis or an Inquiry into the Origin of Languages, Nations and Religions (1833-1836, 2 volumes) by Godfrey Higgins. (Godfrey Higgins (1772-1833), was a British archaeologist, Freemason and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, humanist, social reformer, and author. He was remembered by his parish as a "political radical, reforming county magistrate and idiosyncratic historian of religions." Godfrey Higgins was convinced by his 20/30 years of research that a high culture had existed prior to all historical records. He believed that a prehistoric universal religion existed and all later creeds and doctrines sprang from it. He also believed this religion possessed accurate knowledge of astronomical phenomena. (Godfrey Higgins used precession as a method of investigation. He placed the beginning of the ‘Age of Taurus’ at 4400 BCE.) Higgins proposed ancient knowledge of: (1) precession of the equinoxes (causing displacement of festivals), (2) an equally divided 12-part zodiac, (3) determination of precessional rate (the rate of the precessional cycle), (4) knowledge of a precessional great year, and (5) astronomical mythology/allegory with cyclic content (i.e., occurrences of cyclic cataclysms and upheavals). Higgins addressed the theme of cycles in some detail. A basic theme of the book is that there is a universal basis to all languages and religions and Godfrey Higgins sought to identify the common thread. Godfrey Higgins hypothesized that all religions had sprung from one common origin, which he sought to trace, and he further suggested the existence of a secret religious order, that he termed Pandeism, that once held sway across much of the globe. Anacalypsis is a lengthy 2-volume treatise that was published after the author's death in 1833 (though he did see an advance copy of Volume 1 several months prior to his death). Beginning circa 1830 Volume 1 was initially published in 3 parts. Beginning 1833 the book was published in two quarto volumes (totalling 1,436 pages). It was initially printed as a limited edition of 200 copies, and was partially reprinted in 1878, and completely reprinted in a limited edition of 350 copies in 1927. In 1965, University Books, Inc. published 500 sets for the United States of America and 500 sets for the British Commonwealth (with Publisher's Note and a Postface (brief explanatory note)). It has since been frequently republished since 1965. (http://somerationalism.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/quality-of-sources-godfrey-higgins-pt-1.html): "Godfrey Higgins' main written work is titled Anacalypsis; An Attempt to Draw Aside the Veil of the Saitic Isis; or an Inquiry into the Origin of Languages, Nations and Religions. It was published in two volumes, each available at archive.org nowadays: Vol I, Vol II. It is an illogical, outdated work based on faulty evidence, flawed reasoning, naive misunderstandings and wishful thinking. It seems clear Higgins considered Anacalypsis his main work, but he wrote an earlier work which it seems he considered a preparatory work, and he refers to it a fair bit in Anacalypsis as well. This work goes by the name The Celtic Druids. ... In the first pages of The Celtic Druids - duly note, not Anacalypsis, we find a staggering example of just how much of



an ignorant man he was." In his essay: "Godfrey Higgins' Anacalypsis: A Critique," JPH writes, "The work of Godfrey Higgins, Anacalypsis, is quite nearly as hard to find as a two-headed chicken -- and it is nearly as normal as one. ... It cites few sources for its claims, but those it does cite are the sort of things you won't find easily -- anyone wishing to back-check all of Higgins' comments will be in for a real lifetime chore .... There is no telling whether the bulk of Higgins' sources are credible or not (though we do have some hints). Anacalypsis is full of assertions that are either undocumented or come from sources whose credibility is completely unknown in this time .... It is also, furthermore, that Higgins is so outdated that any arguments he makes based on dating, language, and so on, require at this time a full re-argument before they can be accepted. ... Higgins' editor admits that Higgins was criticized by scholars who "felt that amateurs had no place in their special fields" [459], so even in his day he was obviously considered unreliable. How much more so today in light of what we know now? Anyone using Higgins as a source had best explain themselves as well as Higgins."
The Orion or Researches into The Antiquity of the Vedas (1893) by Bál Tilak. (Demolitions of Tilak's fantasies (which later proponents copy) can be found in: "The Home of the Aryans: an Astronomical Approach," by N. R. Waradpande. In: Shantaram Bhalchandra Deo and Suryanath Kamath (Editors). The Aryan Problem (1993, Pages 123-134); The RigVeda, a Historical Analysis by Shrikant Talageri (1st edition 2000; 2nd edition 2009); The Saffron Swastika by Koenraad Elst (2001, Volume 2). Some comments from publications by Koenraad Elst: "This erratic theory is so inordinately popular among Western racists for providing "independent" Indian confirmation to a North-European Homeland Theory (in reality, Tilak had tried to bend the Vedic evidence often ludicrously, to bring it in conformity with fashionable Western theories)." "The main point is that Tilak goes to absurd lengths to read "Arctic" references in Vedic episodes, e.g., the Battle of the Ten Kings is interpreted metaphorically as referring to the "ten cold months" ...." Tilak's "... theories find no genuine support whosoever in the Vedic text or in any other expression of Hindu tradition, which is why at the end of his life, Tilak developed doubts." Tilak's argument also relied on now outdated early studies of the Vedas by European scholars who advocated a great antiquity for Hindu astronomy. Also, Tilak saw support for his (flawed) chronology in the studies of Hermann Jacobi (whose dating arguments for the 5th-millennium BCE as the date of the Vedas are largely rejected). The proper foundations for the history and antiquity of the Vedas and Hindu astronomy were laid by Max Müller and Henry Colebrooke. The work of David Pingree has clarified many issues and further supports a recent origin for Indian astronomy. See also the sympathetic biography: Lokmanya Tilak - A Biography by A. K. Bhagwat and G. P. Pradhan (1956, reprinted 2015).)
Astralmythen: Religionsgeschichtliche untersuchungen (5 parts, 1896-1907) by Eduard Stucken. Note: Very little of the book(s) actually deal with astral myths. Eduard Ludwig Stucken (18.3.1865, Moscow-9.3.1936 (sometime incorrectly given as 1937), Berlin) (Germany) Writer (Playwright and Novelist)/Panbabylonist/Amateur Philologist/Grail Poet. Also, an amateur artist and amateur pianist. Stucken's drawings were published (he mentioned the English poet, painter, and print maker William Blake (1757-1827) as a major influence on his work). Stucken Edward was the son of a German-American merchant/businessman. After attending high school in Dresden from 1882 to 1884, he completed a commercial apprenticeship in Bremen. After completing his initial training as a merchant he then studied art history and linguistics (Assyriology(Assyrian) and Egyptology(Egyptian)) at universities in Dresden and Berlin. (He studied linguistics and Egyptology in Berlin, 1887-1890.) He then worked temporarily at the German Naval Observatory in Hamburg. He was widely travelled. Stucken undertook extensive tours of Europe and the East. His travels included to Greece, the Crimea, the Caucasus, and Italy and England as well. During 1890/1891 he took part in a scientific expedition to Syria. It is indicated he participated in more than one academic expedition to the Middle East. From 1891 onwards he lived in Berlin and worked as a freelance writer. Stucken is best known as a writer of literature. His early writing is heavily indebted to popular neo-romantic trends. However, his early attempts as a neo-romantic writer failed. In the following decades, he published a number of scientific studies in addition to anthropological and historical subjects. His numerous publications include studies on ethnology, the history of language, and myths (myth motifs). In 1902 he published Beitrage zur orientalische Mythologie. In 1913 Stucken explored his ideas of the relations of the alphabet with the Moon (Der Ursprung des Alphabets und die Mondstationen). His extensive published output also included literary works. Eduard Stucken has been described as an exotic and esoteric writer of neo-Romantic tendencies with a predilection for mythological themes. His literary work includes novels, short stories, poems and plays. Stucken's novels contain occult themes. Occultism was popular in Germany at the time. In his early, neoromantic dramas his works are often derived from Celtic mythology. It has been remarked his prose works are characterized by the author's penchant for opulence and exoticism, and a tendency toward a bombast style. Stucken was a prolific author of Arthurian literature and also one of the neo-romantic poets. He wrote stories and several (lengthy) poems, epics, and dramas. Stucken wrote numerous successful plays on Celtic mythological subjects (though nowadays largely forgotten). Between 1901 and 1924 he composed 8 Grail dramas (eight-play Arthurian cycle) which were collected under the title, Der Gral. Ein dramatisches Epos (1924). Stucken produced wordy verse fairy tales in his 8-part dramatic Holy Grail cycle (most of which appeared 1902-19l6, Die Zauberer Merlin appeared in 1924). (His Grail cycle, or dramatic epos as it has been called, consisted of 8 plays: Gawan (1901), Lanval (1903), Lanzelot (1909), Merlins Geburt ("Merlin's Birth," 1912), Tristram und Ysolt (1916), Das verlo - rene Ich ("The Lost Self," 1922), Vortigern (1924), and Zauberer Merlin ("Merlin the Magician," 1924).) Several of the Arthurian plays were written in rhyming verse, and were produced by Max Reinhardt (1873-1943), Gawan (1902), Lanzelot (1909), and Merlins Geburt (1912), and treated the story of Tristan in the play Tristram und Ysolt (1916). His neo-romantic play Tristram und Ysolt [Tristram und Yseult] (1916), was heavily influence by the German composer Wilhelm Richard Wagner. (In 1938 Max Reinhardt emigrated first to England, then to the United States.) It has been stated that the culmination of the romantic drama was achieved by Eduard Stucken with these grail-cycle mystery plays. Stucken juggled plots and characters in order to transform the Grail quest into the central thread connecting Arthurian themes based on diverse sources, including Karl Immermann's Merlin: Eine Mythe (1832). His Grail plays combine religious mysticism and Jugendstil. Also, the plays were described as full of neo-romantic colouring and often feverish sensuality. It was also considered they lacked real dramatic impact. Stucken's most successful work was the multi-volume historical novel, Die weißen Götter (1918-1922), describing (inaccurately) the destruction of the Aztec empire by the Spanish. (Hefte 1: 1918; hefte 2: 1920; hefte 3: 1920; hefte 4: 1922.) The set of historical novels deals with Mexico and Montezuma in the period before and after the advent of Cortes. His novels were based on exotic subject matter, especially his 4-volume epic, Die Weiß Götter (1918(sometimes given as 1917)-1922). Stucken found international acclaim in his 50s with this particular novel. Previous to this recognition he had been prolific as a dramatist (writing plays). The novel was translated and printed several times and reflected the contemporary popularity of exoticism. It was translated into English as, The Great White Gods. Stucken immersed himself in Mexican lore when writing this novel. The novel was criticized for cramming far too much historical detail into its story. However, it was still considered exciting reading. The novel was a lengthy saga of the Spanish conquest of Mexico. See the critical (English-language) book review (in The Saturday Review of Literature, November 17, 1934, Page 289) by Oliver Farge of the English-language translation (by Frederick Martens), The Great White Gods (1934). Stucken is criticised for being a mediocre historian. Another of his historical works that was translated into English was The dissolute years; a pageant of Stuart England, translated Marguerite Harrison, published New York, Farrar & Rinehart, 1935. Stucken also wrote on vampires. It has been identified that Stucken’s great liking for the occult showed in his Astralmythen. For Stucken as an occult writer see: The Esoteric Musical Tradition of Ferruccio Busoni by Judith Crispin (2007, Page 235). Together with Ernst Siecke he began the “star-myth” school. According to Stucken all myths are creation myths. Stucken wrote 'scholarly' works on astral myths, Oriental mythology, and Polynesian languages. (At least attempted such.) Stucken held to a diffusionist view of history (with some modifications to his ideas over time). Stucken was the first person to publish a major Panbabylonian work (Astralmythen, Part 1, 1896). His Astralmythen appeared in 5 parts over the years 18861907. This work of Stucken paved the way for the tenets of Panbabylonism which made Babylonian the prime centre of all ancient religious thought. The entire theory of Panbabylonism received its stimulus from Stucken’s elaborate work, Astralmythen. Astralmythen was originally prepared as a doctoral dissertation but was abandoned due to difficulties with it. His doctoral supervisor declared himself incapable of judging it.



Stucken dedicated Astralmythen to the eminent folklorist Adolph Bastion (his uncle at the University of Berlin, who encouraged him in his academic pursuits), but as a diffusionist he explicitly rejected evolutionist ideas regarding folklore tales. Stucken had intellectual connections with the star-myth school of Siecke in that he adopted the methods of the star-myth school. However, Stucken (an amateur Orientalist/philologist) knew no restraint and attempted to trace the whole system of world myths (at least those he believed to be astral) back to Babylon. It was the work of Stucken that paved the way for the attempt to make Babylonia the prime centre of all religious thought. The sources for old Babylonian religion included an emphasis on, both actual and imagined, astronomical and meteorological phenomena. When the notion of diffusion was added on we had Panbabylonism. The religious nature of scientific knowledge in ancient Mesopotamia was quickly recognised from the earliest studies of cuneiform scientific texts. This - and building on the claims of the amateur comparative mythologist Stucken - was the foundation for the Panbabylonist claim for the existence of astral religions. Eduard Stucken likely followed the nature-myth theories of Max Müller. Of all the key Panbabylonists, Stucken was the least committed to the Panbabylonist endeavour. Whilst Stucken was initially influential to the Panbabylonian project he was too eclectic in his interests to be tied to it. His greater interest was literature. Later in life Stucken became interested in the Pacific region and the Americas. By 1927 some (dubious) linguistic parallels he had uncovered among Polynesia, the Americas, and Sumer made him question the basis principle of Panbabylonism: the origin of culture may not be the Near East but the Pacific region instead – Indonesia, or Thailand, or the lost continent of Atlantis. Eduard Stucken came to hold the opinion that the origin of civilization was to be located, not in Mesopotamia or the legendary continent of Atlantis, but in a 6th continent "Oceania," that has been broken up into the present archipelago of Polynesia, Micronesia and Melanesia by cataclysmic upheavals of Nature. Stucken postulated the inhabitants of the east coast of the shattered continent "Oceania" found a 2nd home in America (also, there was possibly sea-borne commerce between the empire of the Incas and Polynesia), while the inhabitants of the west coast travelled by ship to India, Mesopotamia, and Madagascar (but may originally have settled in Thailand or in the Sunda Islands). Stucken cited what he believed was the affinity of language between the Egyptians, the Sumerians, the Polynesians (MalayoPolynesian languages), and the South Americans. (See Stucken's, Polynesisches Sprachgut in Amerika und in Sumer (MVAG, Band 31, Heft 12, 1927, 127 Pages).) (Paul Rivet (1876-1958, the French anthropologist/ethnologist and diffusionist) also made a similar claim.) The custom of building pyramids was also cited in support of the theory. According to Stucken words which were written in cuneiform script on clay tablets circa 6,000 years ago were still in use in America and Polynesia. As example of his philological argument: The Sumerian word kud means to part, the Maori word koti means to cut, the Peruvian word kutu means to break a thread with the teeth, and the Mexican word kokota means cutter. Stucken's scholarship was criticised for being too fanciful. Eduard Stucken belonged to the Prussian Academy of Arts and remained a member even after the Nazi purges of the Academy in 1933. In October 1933 he was one of the "loyal German authors" who were signatories of the loyalty pledge "Faithful Pledge of Allegiance ("Gelöbnisses treuester Gefolgschaft")," addressed to the Hitler regime. Throughout his life/career Stucken moved back and forth between literature and myth scholarship. Stucken became a father for the first and only time on his 60th birthday. He asked Alfred Jeremias to be the godfather. (See also: "Eduard Stucken: Eine Studie." by Clemens de Baillou (Kentucky Foreign Romance Quarterly, Volume 8, Issue 1, 1961, Pages 1-6).

For brief biographical details see: Dictionary of German Biography, Volume 9: Schmidt-Theyer edited by Walther Killy, et al. (2005, Pages 623).

Creation Records Discovered in Egypt by George St. Clair (1898). Precession encoded in mythology - with a 12 constellation zodiac of equal divisions.
History and Chronology of the Myth-Making Age (1901) by James Hewitt. James Hewitt also believed that myth was a narrative that described phenomena visible in the sky, and especially the moving features of the sky. According to Hewitt myths were a surviving relic of the genuine ancient history of the earliest ages of human culture - a type of historical document. Myth represents a lost system of historical recording. In his investigations of mythology Hewitt believed he could understand how all ancient people organised time. Hewitt's interpretation of mythology encompassed astral phenomena. He described early mythological epochs in terms of what he believed were the dominant forms of worship i.e. progressively pole-star worship, lunar worship, and then solar worship as culmination. Also important to Hewitt's interpretation was his belief that myths were involved with astrology and astrological cycles. According to Hewitt an astrological method of reading mythology will enable the historical data within each myth to be revealed. Unfortunately he ignored the late origin of constellations and also precession. See the Englishlanguage) book reviews by Anon in The Journal of the British Astronomical Association, Volume XII, Number 3, 1901-2, Page 140; Folk-Lore, Volume XIII, December, Number IV, 1902, Pages 441-442. A (English-language) book review also appeared in The Westminster Review, Volume 157, 1902, Pages 295-? See also the lengthy critical (English-language) review by Anon of his books in Nature, Volume 66, Number 1702, 1902, Thursday, June 12, Pages 145-147. The reviewer makes the point that Hewitt's books are full of philological absurdities. Book review (slightly abbreviated) in Folk-Lore: "Ever since the beginnings of the study of myths, enquirers have been inclined, like Mr. Casaubon, to search for some one "key to all the mythologies." Often, as in the case of Max Muller and the nature school, they have hit on a true principle, and run it to death; so the latest exponent of this school, O. Gilbert, who derives everything from the clouds, has been led to propound the most fantastic theories in order to include everything. The day of totems too, seems to be waning; and of late years the tendency has been to exaggerate the importance of astronomy. This is exemplified in the works of Mr. Robert Brown, Jr., and Mr. St. Clair. The book now before us is a third instance of the same mistake. Mr. Hewitt divides his work into books dealing successively with the Age of Polar Star Worship, the Age of Lunar-Solar Worship, and the Age of Solar Worship. He connects the religious beliefs which he sees, with the worship of trees and animals, with the various migrations of mankind, and with their arrangement of the calendar; and uses his principles to interpret certain legends of the saints and others. But these connections are not made clear. Probably they are clear to the writer, but to the reader they are not so. Nor is proof offered, other than coincidence, of the connection of astronomy with religion. The theories are, for the most part, propounded ex cathedra, and left to commend themselves by their inherent appropriateness. Symbolism and metaphor too often do duty for argument. Thus Mr. Hewitt says: "Achilles was the sun-god of the race of the Myrmidons or ants, the sons of the red earth, the Adamite race who succeeded the sons of the southern mother-tree, and who believed that man was formed from the dust of the earth moulded by the Divine Potter, the Pole-star god, who turned the potter's wheel of the revolving earth." This is all pure imagination. Symbolism is also used to explain certain primitive signs, amongst them the sign for the female, which is clearly pictorial (p. 72). The Breotian eel, in place of being a fisher's firstling, is also moralised (p. 128); so is the bed of Odysseus (p. 144), where the potter's wheel reappears. There is no historical examination, as there should be, of the principles and limitations of symbolism, which, in western lands at least, plays a much smaller part than is usually assumed. Mr. Hewitt also ventures on the dangerous ground of etymology. .... Again : the oldest Cyclopean walls are said here to be accurately fitted polygonal; and there are many other signs that Mr. Hewitt's general knowledge is insufficient for the building up of a universal theory such as this. But when we come to Indian questions, the case is altered. Mr. Hewitt can tell us by firsthand knowledge of the village system, sacred groves and common halls, of priestly ritual revealed to him as a special favour (p. 159), and the customs of Chotia Nagpur. We cannot help wishing he had confined himself to these topics, and give us in detail what he hints at or sketches in tantalising fashion. There is much of value to be learned from the book by a discriminating reader; but the general impression is one of confused statement and rash inference." Hewitt, however, believed he was writing revolutionary works on ancient history and astronomical mythology (= precessional mythology). James Hewitt (1835(36?)-1908) was a career civil servant in the Indian Civil Servant (Bengal Government Service). He died in retirement in England at the age of 72. He was born in Ireland in June, 1835. In March, 1870, he married Constance Stanley, the youngest



daughter of Edward Stanley (then deceased). (See: The Baronetage and Knightage of the British Empire for 1882 by Joseph Foster (1882).) Hewitt was a member of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland for 20 years. (His obituary is contained in its Journal - July, 1908, Pages 963-966.) He was also a member of the Asiatic society of Bengal. (The Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, January to December 1884, lists his election as August, 1875.) He was also a subscriber to the Proceedings of the International Congress of Americanists. (In the 1902 Congress Proceedings he is mentioned as presenting the paper: "The History of the Sun God in India, Persia, and Mexico: His Annual Death and Resurrection, and his Impenetrable Armour.") James Hewitt was the son of a clergyman, the Hon. J. P. Hewitt. He was educated in England at Westminster and Christ Church (Matriculated at Christ Church in 1854), Oxford. Before entering the Indian Civil Service he lived mostly in Warwickshire, near Coventry. He died after a short illness precipitated by an attack of influenza followed by pneumonia (at Holton Cottage, Wheatley, in Oxfordshire). He was appointed to the Indian Civil Service after passing the open Competitive Examination of 1858 (for admission to the Civil Service of India). He arrived in India in February, 1859. He served variously as Assistant Magistrate, Audit Collector, Settlement Officer, Deputy Commissioner, Magistrate, and Commissioner. sources are somewhat conflicting. In 1863 he went to Chota Nagpur[/Nagpore] (Bengal) as Deputy Commissioner and eventually replaced Colonel Edward Dalton (1815-1880) (East India Company) as the Commissioner of the Province. However, from the end of 1864 until 1869 he was Settlement Officer for the adjoining district of Chuttisgurh. In February, 1873, he was appointed Deputy Commissioner, Wards Estate in Behar. In September, 1874, he was Officiating Secretary for the Board of Review. In October, 1878, he was appointed Magistrate and Collector, 1st grade. In March, 1879, he was appointed Commissioner, Chota Nagpur division. (See: The India list and India Office list, 1902.) He retired in July, 1883 (some sources have July, 1885) and had returned to Britain at least by 1887. His retirement address was initially - at least till 1896 - Devoke Lodge, Walton-on-Thames; then later - at least by 1902 - Holbon Cottage, Oxford. Similar to Colonel Dalton (who was the first to pioneer ethnological studies in Bengal and whose major book was Descriptive Ethnology of Bengal (1872)) he engaged in anthropological investigations of the local culture. He apparently had a good knowledge of Sanskrit. His books are not reliable (and probably neither are his numerous published articles). (He was an Ordinary Member of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.) The reviewer in Notes and Queries, 1908, reservedly commented: "Mr. Hewitt has not the gifts of lucid exposition; and orderly argumentation." (Jeanne Reesman describes his books as "utter nonsense" and prefixes her description as charitable.
Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes (1904) by Leo Frobenius. Leo Frobenius (1873-1938) had, from the early 1900s, published Panbabylonian ideas and claimed correspondence between mythological themes and celestial phenomena, world-wide. He was a proponent of the astro-mythological approach and a diffusionist. The German ethnographer Leo Frobenius was the founder of the Institute of Cultural Morphology, which was destroyed by Allied Bombing in World War II. His work is now regarded as outdated and flawed. He created dozens of speculative/foolish theories. See: "Leo Frobenius and the Revolt Against the Western World." by Suzanne Marchand in Journal of Contemporary History, Volume 32, Number 2, April, 1997, Pages 153-170. In 1911 he claimed to have discovered the 'lost continent of Atlantis' in Africa. See: Leo Frobenius, anthropologue, explorateur, aventurierle monde étranger, c'est moi (1999) by Hans-Jürgen Heinrichs. Frobenius was an eccentric amateur German ethnologist/anthropologist and archaeologist, who was the originator of the concepts of the Kulturkreise (culture circles) and of the Paideuma (or "soul" of culture). Due to his proposal not being supported by sufficient evidence Frobenius was not formally credited with the idea. He lacked formal academic qualifications and was criticized by scientists for his non-systematic and rather romantic approach to anthropology. Frobenius was involved in extensive research in Africa, which was made possible by donors and by his own income from books and lectures. He left school without gaining any formal qualifications because his family moved constantly, and Frobenius did not attend school regularly. For this reason he could not satisfactorily take up his studies at a university but became an autodidact. His PhD thesis was rejected. Leo Frobenius, a pupil of Friedrich Ratzel, expanded on the "culture circle" concept. See: Frobenius, Leo (1898) Die Weltanschauung der Naturvolker. The Kulturkreise (culture circle) school of thought was proposed by Friedrich Ratzel and the concept then widened by his student Leo Frobenius. This version formulated by Leo Frobenius in Vienna was called "culture circles" or Kulturkreise. He was also a diffusionist. In Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes, Frobenius sought an ancient sun myth origin for world-wide mythology.
Das Alte Testament im Lichte des Alten Orients (3rd Revised Edition 1916 (2 Volumes)) by Alfred Jeremias. (The claim of the German Panbabylonists (especially Alfred Jeremias) that Mesopotamian/Sumerian astrology originated in the supposed zodiacal age of Gemini (circa 5,000 - 6,000 BCE) and is the foundation of all the religions and cultures throughout the world is impossible to maintain. Both Hugo Winckler and Alfred Jeremias claimed the astral theory underpinning the 'Weltanschauung' ('view of the universe') originated in the 'Age of the Twins' (Gemini). Winkler dated such between 5,700 BCE and 2,500 BCE. Alfred Jeremias (The Old Testament in the Light of the Ancient Near East, (English edition (1911), Volume 1, Pages 13 & 71) claimed mythological motifs connecting the beginning of a new era with Gemini (Dioscuros myths) indicate that the zodiac was devised in the 'Age of the Twins.' He further claimed: "A planisphere from the library of Assurbanipal [K 8538 (CT 33, 10)], based upon ancient calculations ... show's a graduation of the sun's course and marks for the zero point a point between the Bull and the Twins ("Scorpion's Star, 70 degrees")." Alfred Jeremias concluded that the zodiacal division of the heavens was devised in the 'Age of Gemini' prior to the Sumerian civilization beginning. Also, he claimed: "In the most remote time upon which we have as yet any historical light, the spring equinox was in the zodiacal sign of Gemini." It would be a mistake to think that Alfred Jeremias was a pioneering assyriologist. Alfred Jeremias was, of course, no such person. After studying Assyriology and theology Alfred Jeremias spent most of his life working as a Lutheran Pastor in Leipzig. He basically pursued assyriology as a pastime and only late in life came to hold a permanent university position in assyriology. Following World War 1 Jeremias spent his time mostly updating his key publications and produced only a few new pamphlets. Alfred Jeremias would be judged "odd" by reasonable benchmarks. He held that the various cultures of mankind are no more than the dialects of one and the same spiritual language. He became an admirer of the notorious racist Hermann Wirth who was a Dutch-German lay amateur folklorist and historian of ancient religions and symbols. It appears Alfred Jeremias was not above toying with reincarnation and characterising the Panbabylonist Hugo Winckler as an old Babylonian king. During the hey-day of Panbabylonism (early 19th-century) the chronology of early Mesopotamian/Babylonia was in a confused state. Very early dates were mistakenly established. Mesopotamian/Babylonian chronology was not suitably stabilized until circa the 1940s. At the turn of the 19th-century Sargon of Akkad was dated to circa 3,800 BCE until decades later circa 2,350 BCE was confidently established. (In one of his publications Jeremias dated Sargon to 2,650 BCE.) Hermann Hilprecht had no problem with dating Enshakushanna, an early king of Uruk, to circa 6,500 BCE. The current dating is circa 2,500 BCE. At this period in assyriology new material always compelled lowering of dates. (See, for example: "A Third Revision of the Early Chronology of Western Asia." By William Albright (Bulletin of the American School of Oriental Research, Number 88, December, 1942, Pages 28-36).)
Hagar, Stansbury, (1917). "The American Zodiac." (American Anthropologist, New Series, Volume 19, Number 4, October-December, Pages 518532). (Stansbury Hagar was convinced of the existence of a common native zodiac in America. He argued for the existence of zodiacs, having very similar aspects, in Peru, Yucatan, Mexico (the Nahuas), and amongst the Pueblo and Hopi tribes. Further, he believed this zodiac corresponded closely to the Western zodiac inherited from Babylonia through the Greeks. He did not attempt to explain how pre-Columbian communication between the Old and New worlds occurred. He only offered that it had occurred centuries prior to the Spanish conquest and that it was accidental and sporadic (not the result of any general migration), and achieved by unknown route or routes. His evidence for the Old and New world zodiacs being identical was 3-fold: (1) The star-chart of Salcamayhua drawn by an Aymara Indian of Peru circa 1613, which depicts 12 zodiacal signs known in the Western zodiac (obviously Spanish influence rather than surviving native tradition); (2) Place-names within and around the sacred capital city Cuzco reflected the names and comparative positions of the 12 zodiacal signs (now discredited); and (3) The ritual of the annual festivals one of which was held each month and was directed towards the sign through which the sun was passing at the date of the



festival, that is, the details of each ceremony reflected the attributes if it governing sign. He also maintained the existence of this zodiac is further attested by Blas Valera, a 'half-blood' Quechua Indian who wrote only a generation after the Spanish conquest, as well as by early Spanish writers.)
Altgermanische Kulturprobleme (1929) by Franz Schröder. [Note: In Hamlet's Mill (1969) the authors Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend, reference 2 works by the German philologist Franz Rolf Schröder, and invoke his ideas in a short quote from Altgermanische Kulturprobleme (1929). It is obvious they are influenced by Franz Schröder's ideas on numbers in world-wide mythology. His 2 books listed in the Bibliography are Altgermanische Kulturprobleme (1929), and Skadi und die Götter Skandinaviens (1941). Dr. Franz Rolf Schröder (1893-1979) was Privatdozent der deutschen und nordischen Philologie an der Universität Heidelberg. (One source states he was Professor in the University of Wutzburg.) He was a germanistischer und skandinavistischer Mediävist. From 1920-1971 he was editor of the Germanisch-Romanische Monatsschrift [Germanic-romance Monthly]. The founder of the journal was his academic father Heinrich Schröder. Franz Scrhöder's early willingness to critically assess speculative/fanciful ideas ended circa 1936 and was completed when he was accepted as a member of the National Socialist Party. In his book, Altgermanische Kulturprobleme [Problems of Ancient Germanic Culture] (1929, approximately 160 pages), Franz Schröder pointed out the presence of certain numbers that repeatedly appear in mythology world-wide. (See the unfavourable (German-language) book review by Gustav Neckel, (from 1923 Professor of Old Germanic Studies at the University of Berlin), in DLZ [Deutsche Literaturzeitung], Band 50, Neue Folge 6, Hefte 1, 1929, Pages 521-524. The issue had first been investigated around the turn of the 19th-century by the German star-myth school.]

Die vedischen Nachrichten von den Naxatra (2 Parts, 1860-1861) by Albrecht Weber. Albrecht Weber (1825-1901) was a German Indologist and historian. His field of specialisation was Vedic literature. Weber also made valuable contributions in the field of Jain studies and Prakrit. He was considered one of the outstanding scholars of the latter half of the 19th-century. In 1842, he went to Breslau University where he studied Sanskrit with the Indologist Adolf Stenzler. He also attended lectures on classical philology and history. He later went to Bonn and Berlin and then returned to Breslau. He received his PhD at Breslau where, in 1845, he submitted his doctoral thesis Yajurveda Specimen cum commentario. From 1846 to 1848 he visited England and France in connection with his studies. A travel grant from the Prussian Academy enabled Weber to stay in France and England. During his stay in these countries he collated manuscripts of the White Yajurveda. On his return to Germany, he went to the University of Berlin, where he was privatdocent. In 1848, Weber qualified as university professor in Berlin. In 1856 he became an Adjunct (Associate) Professor of the Language and Literature of Ancient India. In 1867 he was appointed full professor. Weber was a member of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin, and was the author of many books and periodical contributions on classical subjects. Weber educated a whole generation of Indologists. Also, he was a close friend of Max Müller. The problem of the chronology of Indian texts induced Weber to study astronomical texts. In his Die vedischen Nachrichten von den Naxatra ("Vedic accounts of the Nakshatras"), published in 2 parts, 1860 and 1861, he concluded (correctly) that the Indian 'lunar mansions,' the nakshatras, could not have originated in China ('lunar lodges') as this type of system was mentioned earlier in India. After studying the semantic development of the word nakshatra in Vedic sources, Weber concluded (incorrectly) that the Indian (and other ?) concept of lunar 'mansions' had been borrowed from Babylonia.

The belief in coded astronomy pre Hamlet's Mill
Astro-mythological interpretations of mythology involving precession certainly existed prior to Hamlet's Mill. The belief in 'coded astronomy' in myth also existed prior to Hamlet's Mill. It's foundations originated in the 1930s with Friedrich Röck, a professor at the University of Vienna. Röck (following Eduard Seler (who, was influenced in his interpretation of myths by his contemporary Max Müller and by 1906, was influenced by the German star-myth school (especially Ernst Siecke's ideas concerning lunar mythology) and Panbabylonism) and the Viennese priest Damien Kriechgauer) believed that Mesoamerican manuscripts contained hidden astronomical content. Röck called his method "Ortugskunde," "the science of getting one's bearings." (In the early 1950s Röck was Professor Emeritus.) Karl Nowotny (1904-1978, an authority on ancient Mesoamerica), who studied art history and ethnology at the University of Vienna in the 1930s and was a student of Röck, in his doctoral dissertation (Kommentar zum Codex Laud) completed in 1939 critically discussed the concept coded astronomy in the Mexican Codex Laud. The use of Röck's "Ortugskunde," and concessions to it, were forced on Nowotny by Röck as his dissertation supervisor. (Also, according to von Dechend's predecessor Eduard Stucken there were formal formulas of astral mythology. Mythology was converted into a formula for universal application.)
The influential and productive Americanist Eduard Seler (1849-1922) is considered the founder of pre-colonial Mexican and Amerindian studies in Germany. He traveled to Mexico six times between 1887 and 1910 with his wife (who was his co-researcher). Eduard Seler's work is closely linked to that of his wife, Caecilie Seler-Sache.
Friedrich Röck was born in Imst (Tyrol), July 14, 1879, and died in Linz (Upper Austria), November 10, 1953. He was an ethnologist and in 1927 he established the Vienna Ethnological Museum and became its director. (The opening ceremony was on May 25, 1928.) He popularised ethnology and decoded the Codex Vindobonensis Mexicanus (Maya hieroglyphs).
Karl Nowotny (21.6.1904, Hollabrunn (Lower Austria) – 31.12.1978, Vienna) was an Austrian ethnographer, art historian and academic, specialising in the study of Mesoamerican cultures. He is most renowned for his pioneering analyses and reproductions of Mesoamerican codices, and his commentaries on their iconography and symbolisms. Nowotny also contributed extensively to the study and interpretation of preColumbian Mesoamerican calendars, their functioning and how they were used. His analysis and exposition of the ritual and divinatory importance of the Tonalamatl Almanac has been regarded as of "critical importance" to the modern understanding of this almanac, and a significant development beyond the primarily astronomically based approach of Eduard Seler and other predecessors. Nowotny studied Anthropology, Philosophy, and Art History at the University of Vienna. In 1939 he completed his Ph D thesis and graduated. He participated in military service in World War II and after being released from a prisoner-of-war camp in 1947 he took an assistant position at the Museum of Ethnology in Vienna (Museum für Völkerkunde). He progressed to become a custodian at the museum and also chair of its Department for Central and South America. In 1954 Nowotny finished his habilitation thesis and in addition to working in the museum he began lecturing at the University of Vienna. (According to one source he was promoted to professor at the University of Vienna in 1953.) In 1965 he received the rank of



"University Professor Extraordinary." In 1964-1965 he held an interim (visiting) professorship at the Department of Anthropology and African Studies at the University of Mainz. From 1965 to 1977 he was a visiting professor at the University of Cologne. After his return to Vienna he gained a full professorship at the University of Vienna, where he lectured not only on Anthropology but also on ancient American cultures. He specialised in studying ancient Mexican cultures and their historical documents. In 1966 Nowotny took up a visiting professorship at the Department of Social and Cultural Anthropology in Cologne. He also he conducted a number of research projects on several ethnic groups on in Northern and Central America. In 1977 he returned to Vienna, where he died in 1978 at the age of 74.
In his articles published in the German periodicals Tribus and Indiana between 1972 and 1974, the German academic Thomas Barthel supported the concept of 'information coding' in Mesoamerican manuscripts. For this approach he drew heavily on the writings of Friedrich Röck (and also Karl Nowotny). Thomas Barthel founded the Indo-Mexican Institute at Tübingen.
Thomas Barthel was born on January 4, 1923 in Berlin. He was the son of Max Barthel, a socialist poet. During WWII Barthel worked as decoder for the German Forces - his later scientific interest in deciphering sign systems is considered to be directly related to his wartime work. In 1946 Barthel studied Völkerkunde in Berlin with Richard Thurnwald and Sigrid Westphal-Hellbusch, as well as Geography with Albrecht Haushofer. In 1949 he studied Ethnology in Leipzig with Julius and Eva Lips. Finally, he moved to Hamburg (to study with Franz Termer), where he finished his PhD in 1952 on the Dresden Maya Manuscript. Together with Ursula Schlenther, Wolfgang Haberland and Günter Zimmerman, Barthel formed part of the so called Hamburg School of Old Americanists. In 1957/1958 he carried out field research in Atacamenos/Chile, as well as on Easter Island. In 1965/1966 he worked in Mexico, 1970 in Peru. Barthel habilitated in Hamburg (1957/1958) on the Easter Island Scripture (Rongorongo) and in 1959 Tübingen University appointed him an extraordinary professor. From 1964 to 1988 Barthel led the new Institute for Ethnologie in Tübingen. After the traumatic GAA-Conference of 1969 in Göttingen (which was partly related to the accusations of German complicity with the genocide on Brazilian Indians), Barthel chaired a commission to shed light on the accusations. He died on April 3, 1997 in Tübingen.
Vienna pre WWII was the centre of the diffusionist school which developed out of the ideas of Wilhelm Schmidt (1868-1954). Friedrich Röck was not a member of the diffusionist school. Neither was Karl Karl Nowotny.
See the foreword by Ferdinand Anders in (the edited English-language translation) Tlacuilolli by Karl Nowotny (2005, original German-language publication 1961). In this book, Nowotny offers informed alternatives to the astral interpretations of Eduard Seler and his students. Nowotny opposed the type of speculative approach engaged in by Röck. Ferdinand Anders writes (Foreward, Page XIII): "Nowotny's avoidance of fantastic attempted interpretations and contrived conjectures lasted throughout his life's work. His words provide a warning that the works of Eduard Seler, translated in the past into English and Spanish, are to be understood as a collection of historic sources and should not be the impetus for new attempts at astral decipherment ... Again may we never forget Nowotny's urgent warning against easy and false conclusions."
The main academic figures comprising an influential stream of comprising the Viennese Mythological School, including Karl von Spiess, promoted a theory of the ritualistic origin of myths in ancient cults and their secret societies and their survival in contemporary folklore (i.e., stories and customs). It would be surprising if Hertha von Dechend was not aware of these ideas. For some adherents of the Viennese School of Mythology ancient cultures had secret societies whose members retained knowledge which later survived as legends, folk stories, and folk customs. This provided another 'well' of ideas which Hertha von Dechend could draw upon.
For a type of astronomical code (metaphor) in myth (different to Hamlet's Mill); one which interlocks with a sociological code, see Claude LéviStrauss.
Note on Witold Balcer (Also spelled Belza?)
Balcer, Witold. (1948? (likely unpublished)). The Mystery of the Zodiac. Note: It is uncertain whether the book was actually published or remained in manuscript form. See: "Witold Balcer's "Mystery of the Zodiac." [a review]" by Michael Kamienśki (Atlantean Research [Atlantis], Volume 1, Number 6, March, 1949, Pages 95-96). Also, "Avalon: The Mystery of the Zodiac (Conclusion)." by Witold Balcer (Atlantean Research [Atlantis], Volume 2, Number 1, April/May, 1949, Pages 14-16). Witold Balcer (researcher and collector/historian?/archaeologist?) was Polish (and prior to World War II had accumulated a very large private library and collection of ancient art artifacts) and The Mystery of the Zodiac was published in Poland. His book is mentioned in an article published in Africana Bulletin (Number 37-40, 1991-1992, Page 110). (Africana Bulletin is a Polish academic publication published by the University of Warsaw.) I have yet to determine whether The Mystery of the Zodiac was in Polish or English. (Likely it was in Polish with at least one short summary in English. The summary indicates just how fantastically speculative and separated from reality the book was.) If indeed published it is now a very rare book and does not appear in any catalogues. The origin of the mythological interpretation of zodiacal precession and the effects of zodiacal ages on humankind was the subject of the book. In some ways the book/manuscript is a precursor to themes in Hamlet's Mill (1969). Witold Balcer believed that 15,000 years ago there existed a culture that knew precession and introduced a 12-symbol zodiac (the Adamites). The concealed symbolic meaning of the zodiac refers to individual human life and also to the cultural life of humankind. This interpretation uses Virgo as the first sign and a retrograde direction through the signs to obtain the interpretation. It is most likely that the book remained unpublished. Whether Egerton Sykes ever had a copy of the manuscript is unknown. It appears the Polish astronomer Michael Kamienśki, a friend and colleague of Witold Balcer, may also have believed the zodiac had a hidden symbolic meaning referring to cycles of human (cultural) life. In believing the zodiacal figures have a concealed symbolic meaning, Kamienśki was likely adopting Balcer's ideas.
It is very difficult to locate any biographical information about Witold Balcer. It is certain that Witold Balcer was an academic (and collector), and somewhat wealthy. It appears he was born 21-10-1921 in Ostrołęka/Scharfenwiese (Polish city integrated into Germany during WWII), and lived in Lochów. (Circa 1930 it is indicated he was living Warsaw.) It is also indicated he was sent to Dachau Concentration Camp on 3-7-1943. By at least 1949 he had died. Before WWII, Balcer and 2 other persons (academics) conducted a series of experiments with the Polish clairvoyant (supposedly, he failed numerous tests) Stefan Ossowiecki [also misspelled Ossowiencki].
Note on Michael Kamienski
Michael Kamienski. Michal Kamieński/Kamienśki] (November 24, 1879 to April 18, 1973) was an eccentric Russian-born Polish astronomer (and mathematician) and comet orbit specialist who spent most of his academic life in Poland (at the University of Krakow (Cracow)). He was a leading world expert on cometary orbits and Halley's Comet. In 1971 Comet Wolf was renamed Comet Wolf-Kamienski in his honour. He was Professor of Astronomy at Warsaw University, and also Director of the Warsaw University Astronomical Observatory from 1923 to 1945. One source indicates Michael Kamienśki, retired circa the mid 1940's; another source indicates he retired in 1963. He was a member of the International Astronomical Union, the Polish Astronomical Society, Warsaw Scientific Society, Astronomical Committee of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and Fellow of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and Associate Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (UK). Michael Kamienski was connected with The Atlantis Research Centre established by the English eccentric (and pre World War II diplomat to Poland) Egerton Sykes. Kamienski



believed that astronomical research could be used to reveal a more exact date for various landmark events in ancient history. In 1956 Michael Kamienski, then Professor of Astronomy at the University of Krakow, gave an on-campus lecture titled "The Tragedy of Atlantis-Poseidia" and dated Halley's Comet back to 9542 BCE, the time of the supposed submersion of Atlantis, and he further engaged in the wild speculation that a part of the tail or part of the head of Halley's Comet had broken off and fallen into the western Atlantic Ocean. (According to another source: "As a result of his investigations he proposed that a part of Halley's Comet fell into the Gulf of Mexico in 9546 BC or 9540 BC and was responsible for the destruction of Atlantis.") An (English-language) obituary for Michael Kamienski by J[an?] Witkowski appeared in The Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 15, 1974, Pages 48-50?/50-52?. The Atlantis Research Centre appears in the obituary as the British Society of Atlantological Research, and it is stated that Kamienski was a member. The name of the organisation in the obituary is fictional and The Atlantis Research Centre was not really a membership society.
The belief in universal coded knowledge pre Hamlet's Mill
In 1897, the Scotsman William Stirling (1861-1902) anonymously published his at times difficult to comprehend book, The Canon - An exposition of the pagan mystery perpetuated in the Cabala as the rule of all the arts. The book can be described as mystical. The book contains a large
amount of material by Vitruvius. A 2nd supplementary book, The Tradition never appeared. In it he argued the gematria constitutes a symbolic pre-Christian language of ancient religion and symbolic cosmology, the immutable standard or canon on which ancient culture is based. Generally, gematria is an Assyro-Babylonian-Greek system of code and numerology later adopted into Jewish culture that assigns numerical value to a word or phrase in the belief that words or phrases with identical numerical values bear some relation to each other or bear some relation to the number itself as it may apply to nature, a person's age, the calendar year, or the like. Within Jewish culture gematia was a Hebrew scriptural exegetical system in which letters may be substituted for numbers. Gematria (numerical interpretation) supposedly holds the key to so-called "ancient wisdom," i.e., the esoteric doctrine of religion. Not much biographical information is known about William Stirling. His architectural training began in April 1879 in Glasgow, Scotland when he was articled (apprenticed) to the Scots architect John Burnet (Senior). In April 1884 he moved to London and settled there. At the completion of his articles in April 1884 he obtained the position of assistant in the office of the London theatre architect Charles Phipps. Between 1885 and 1892 Stirling was involved in the design of several buildings and interiors. By 1893 he had obtained a place with Professor Thomas Smith as a demonstrator in architecture and construction (in the Department of Architecture) at University College, London. There he quickly rose to an assistant's post. He also appears to have had a "home-based" private practice. He was described as a significant collector of rare books. He liked poetry and his literary association included admiration for the poet Wyndham Lewis. The English painter and draughtsman [Sir] William Rothenstein (1872-1945) who knew Stirling, described him as having "an exquisite and lovable nature." At the inquest into Stirling's death by suicide a neighbour described him as being "a hard student, something of a recluse, and eccentric." It was claimed by John Michell that Stirling was a freemason, but there is no surviving record of his alleged membership. Other persons are also certain he was a freemason. William Stirling remain a bachelor. He was never highly paid and would often go without eating in order to be able to consistently provide financial support his aged mother and his unmarried sister, and purchase books.
Vitruvius, in full Marcus Vitruvius Pollio (flourished 1st-century BCE) was a Roman author, architect, civil engineer and military engineer. At one time he worked in some unspecified capacity for Julius Caesar. Vitruvius is best known for his celebrated multi-volume work entitled De architectura (On Architecture). This treatise combines the history of ancient architecture and engineering with the author's personal views.
Reviewers stated The Canon is a difficult book to digest. A lengthy (English-language) book review by William Westcott appeared in The Theosophical Review, Volume XXII, 1898, Pages 85–90), Westcott remarked: "This is not a book for the general public; it is too abstruse and too mathematical." Westcott wrote he found it to be a confusing book: "The reviewer shrinks from the attempt to write a logical account of this work." Also, Westcott stated: "The chapter on Geography is the wildest." Other esoteric journals of the day simply ignored The Canon. H. G. Wells, in The Saturday Review, found it to be utterly bewildering, and poked fun at it. Much later, A. E. Waite considered it critically in The Occult Review, Volume 11, January 1910, Pages 53–54. Waite wrote: "It is beyond the pale of understanding [by] ... the general reader." Even the esoterically inclined poet W. B. Yeats - who knew Stirling - stated he was baffled by Stirling's gematria obsessions.
Stirling's The Canon still remains influential; see: Ancient Cosmology and Early Christian Symbolism by David Fideler (1993).
A revised edition of Stirling's The Canon by Robert Gilbert appeared in 1999. Dr. Robert Gilbert is a writer and retired antiquarian bookseller. He has written and lectured widely on Western esotericism and Christian spirituality, and was the editor of The Christian Parapsychologist. Dr. Gilbert was born and educated in Bristol, and read Philosophy and Psychology at the University of Bristol. Since his retirement he lives with his family in North Somerset.
Part 12: Some Books and Articles Influenced by Hamlet's Mill
Lear, John. (1970). "The Star-Fixed Ages of Man." (Saturday Review, January 10, Pages 99-100). The influence of Hamlet's Mill on John Lear (the science editor for the Saturday Review) is clearly evident.
Stahlman, William. (1970). "The Star-Fixed Ages of Man-2: Global Myths Record Their Passage." (Saturday Review, January 10, Pages 100-103). William Stahlman, an academic and historian of ancient science, states that "Hamlet's Mill is both controversial and exciting; it is essential reading for anyone in the least intrigued by mythology."
Alster, Bendt. (1974). "On the Interpretation of the Sumerian Myth "Inanna and Enki."" (Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und Vorderasiatische Archäologie, Volume 64, I Halband, March, Pages 20-34). (The Danish author, a leading Assyriologist (died 2012), gives an astronomical interpretation of the subject matter. He seems to have been influenced by Hamlet's Mill by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend (1969). Bendt Alster believed that Mesopotamian myths were related to chronology; history was viewed as an eternal succession of cyclic periods, repeating the same patterns. According to Bendt Alster, inherent in structure of Sumerian mythology was the establishment of cyclic time (in which human lives become shorter). History was an eternal return to the same patterns - the (annual (and longer?)) return of the celestial bodies. The author later doubted some of his ideas - he believed his thesis could not withstand criticism - and did not proceed with his proposed book, The Eternal Cycle giving an astronomical interpretation of Sumerian mythology. (He literally tore up the manuscript.) His manuscript argued that the cyclical return of the planets, (and the sun and moon) played an important role in Mesopotamian religion. One source mistakenly gives: Alster, Bendt. (1975). "On the Interpretation of the Myth 'Inanna and Enki." (Zeitschrift für Assyriologie, Band 4, Pages 20-34). Bendt Alster was Professor of Sumeriology in the Institut for Tværkulturelle og Regionale Studier (ToRS), Det Humanistiske Fakultet, Københavns Universitet, Copenhagen, Denmark.)
Alster, Bendt. (1974). "The Paradigmatic Character of Mesopotamian Heroes." (Revue d'Assyriologie et d'Archéologie Orientale, Volume LXVIII, Number 1, Pages 49-60). (The author favours an astronomical interpretation of the subject matter.)



"Wilderness No Wilderness." by Norman Newton (Canadian Literature, Number 63, Winter, 1975, Pages 18-34). (Republished in Canadian Literature, 8 December, 2011. The title of the article is sometimes incorrectly given as "Wilderness To Wilderness." Life dates for Canadian-born Norman Newton (an actor, radio playwright, radio producer, and writer/literary figure) are: 1929-2011.)
"On Survivals of Ancient Astronomical Ideas Among the Peoples of the Northwest Coast." by Norman Newton. (BC Studies, Number 26, Summer, 1975, Pages 16-38). (Expands themes in "Wilderness No Wilderness." The journal title is also given as Synergies.)
Alster, Bendt. (1976). "Early Patterns in Mesopotamian Literature." In: Eichler, Barry. (Editor). Kramer Anniversary Volume, Pages 13-24). (The Danish author, a leading Assyriologist, gives an astronomical interpretation of the subject matter. Bendt Alster believed (at least at time of publication) astronomical observations could be discerned in Sumerian compositions that date as early as the middle of the 3rd-millennium BCE which refer to the movement of the heavenly bodies and the constellations.)
Astronomy of the Ancients edited by Kenneth Brecher and Michael Feirtag (1979, also reprinted with some changes). Papers presented at the symposium at MIT that first appeared in a special issue of Technology Review before being published as a book. Several papers (by Jerome Lettvin and Harald Reiche) are influenced by Hamlet's Mill.
"On Astronomy in the Stone Ages." by B[oris?] A[lekseevich?] Frolov (Current Anthropology, Volume 22, Number 5, 1981, Page 585). "In contrast to many archeologists who tend to play down the intelligence of prehistoric humans, B.A. Frolov insists that these "primitive hunters" constructed surprisingly sophisticated models of the natural world, especially the motions of celestial bodies. Many of these models seem to have been non-utilitarian; that is, built only to satisfy intellectual curiosity. Furthermore, some scientific notions were widespread geographically, indicating perhaps long lines of communication. To illustrate, Frolov cites the similar astronomical sophistication revealed by the Lake Onega petroglyphs in Russia and those at Stonehenge. He also points out that the aborigines of North America, Australia, and Siberia all called the Pleiades the "Seven Sisters." Coincidence is very unlikely here, he says. This and other notions must have existed before Australia and North America were peopled. The absence of writing as we know it would not have deterred ancient humans from developing and communicating mathematical and scientific skills and accumulating knowledge, possibly in the form of myth."
At the Edge of History (1989) by William Thompson. (For a double-dose of the metaphysical/occult ramblings of this leading contemporary 'alternative' thinker - a New Age proponent who confuses fantasy with knowledge - see: At the Edge of History and Passages about Earth: A Double Book (1990). As example: Thompson (pages 143-145) endorses the mediumship/seership and clairvoyance of the British novelist Doris Lessing (née Tayler; born 22 October 1919), especially her early work of "inner space" fiction, Briefing for a Descent into Hell (1971). Thompson claims that in this novel Lessing intuits the astronomical theories of Hertha von Dechend. William Irwin Thompson is known primarily as a social philosopher and cultural critic. Thompson was born in Chicago in July 1938 and grew up in Los Angeles. Thompson received his B.A. at Pomona College and his Ph.D. at Cornell University. He was a professor of humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then at York University in Toronto. He has held visiting appointments at Syracuse University, the University of Hawaii, University of Toronto, and the California Institute of Integral Studies. In 1973, he left academia to found the Lindisfarne Association, a group of New Age scientists, poets, and religious scholars - part of an aggressive New Age movement. On page 164 of the double book Thompson writes of: "... the incredible sophistication of archaic astronomy and its technical language myth ...." Also on page 164: "now that we believe that "History begins at Sumer," we may be startled once again to find that underneath the Sumerians are the far more ancient Atlanteans - which is exactly what the Sumerians tell us in their mythology." Of course Sumerian mythology tells us no such thing. The statement is fictional. On pages 164-165: "Psychologically, I think that all the variations of the Atlantis myth ... indicates that the catastrophe, though suppressed in history, remained in "memory traces" of the collective unconscious." The manner in which Hamlet's Mill influences and even forms part of alternative history speculations is illustrated by "The Ancient Orient." by Ralph Abraham (June 9, 2013, 24 pages; posted on the Internet). The author is with the Mathematics Department, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA. Under the influence of William Irwin Thompson, and using the ideas of multiple authors of alternative history, he speculatively 'tracks' the emergence of geometry and algebra in prehistory.
The Myth of Replacement: Stars, Gods, and Order in the Universe (1991) by Thomas Worthen. (Similar in speculation to the tenets of Hamlet's Mill, by Giorgio De Santillana and Hertha von Dechend (1969). At the time of his book being published he was associate professor of classics at the University of Arizona. Thomas Worthen proposes the Indo-Europeans moved out of the region of the Pontic Caspian steppe (now part of Eastern Ukraine and Southern Russia) circa 3500 BCE, with knowledge of precession already established. Worthen proposes that knowledge of the precesion of the equinoxes produced a sense of crisis throughout the ancient world. Resolution was found in a universal cycle of myths. But it questionable whether the precession of the equinoxes was actually known and felt as traumatic at the popular level of the general population where myth is most lived. What actual perils were believed to be presented?See the (English-language) book reviews by Anon in Scientific American, September, 1991, Volume 265, Number 3, Page 136; by Raymond Mercier in Journal for the History of Astronomy, Volume 23, 1992, Pages 303305; and by Anthony Aveni in Isis, Volume 84, Number 1, March, 1993, Pages 133.)
Myths of the Dog-Man (1991) by David White. (Based on 1988 PhD thesis, University of Chicago. Seems to believe in an early universal 12constellation zodiac. References Hamlet's Mill (1969).)
The Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt: An Essay on Egyptian Religion and the Frame of Time (1992; 2nd edition, 2003) by Jane Sellers (1926
2017). (The author, who was not a professional Egyptologist, uses Egyptian mythology to test the ideas in Hamlet's Mill. Jane Sellers "gained her BA late in life, at Goddard College, Vermont, and went on to study Egyptology at the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute." For reasons unrelated to the course the author did not complete her Ph.D. in Egyptology (under Dr. Klaus Baer) at the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago. Juan Villar, in his book The Seventh Wonder (2005), incorrectly/falsely identifies Jane Sellers as an Egyptologist, and associates her book with the University of Chicago. A revised and updated 2nd edition of her book was first privately published (unbound, i.e., loose sheet form) by the author in 1999 and then published as a bound volume by a minor publisher in 2003 (and this later 2nd edition is the preferred volume to use). Life dates: 1926- . A point worth making is the Babylonian system of degrees left no trace in ancient Egypt. There was no use of a system of degrees in ancient Egypt to measure celestial arcs. The book's argument can be viewed as a failed attempt to support/patch the central thesis of Hamlet's Mill. The article: Sellers, Jane. (2010). "The Succession of World Ages." (Rosicrucian Digest, Number 2, Pages 30-34 is taken from her book, The Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt. Jane Borson Sellers (February 28, 1926 - October 28, 2017) was born in Chicago, Illinois and resided in Chicago, IL. Obituary (Chicago Tribune, November 5, 2017/Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, November 5, 2017): "Jane Borson Sellers, age 91, died October 28, 2017, in Chicago, Illinois, where she was born on February 28, 1926. She rejoiced in memories of her "good life" as one of five children, of whom her sister Lynne Turco survives her. Her brother Bill Borson was killed in WWII; her brother Jack, who served in the Pacific during that war, died at age 42; her sister Dianne died in 2015. Jane married Eldon Lee Sellers, a WWII pilot, in 1945; the marriage ended after five years during which their sons William and Rorick were born. They remarried for another five years while the boys were in high school, and remained good friends. After the boys left for college she, too, left for school, earning the undergraduate degree she began at UCLA in 1944 and completed at Goddard College in Vermont. She studied briefly at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. She traveled extensively. Egypt, Morocco, and Italy were favorites, but the coast of Maine was her great love, along with her research. Jane was proud to have introduced her children to Down East Maine in 1969, where they vacationed for decades with their children and grandchildren. In 1985 she bought a condo in



the newly renovated Carroll Mansion, in Portland, where she lived for ten years. In 2004 she again moved to Maine with her youngest son and daughter-in-law, who had purchased a home in Portland. In 2012 she returned to Chicago to live with her eldest son, Bill, and his wife Jill. She is survived by her two sons, William and Rorick, grand-daughters Elizabeth, Caitlin, Morgan, and Amber Sellers, and great-grandsons William, Khalil, Walker, Callahan, and Alex. She was a close friend of Hugh Hefner, having attended the same high school, and a fortunate investment in Playboy magazine in 1953 later allowed her to invest in real estate, which gave her the leisure to travel the world, study hieroglyphics and ancient astronomy, and write "The Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt". The book, originally published in 1992 by Penguin UK, is still in print (revised 3rd edition, Lulu Books, 2007). The revised 3rd edition (Lulu Books, 2007) has computer printouts, which the Penguin edition lacked, and is 6 x 9 format, rather than the larger, "cocktail table" size of the 2nd edition.)

Sacred Geography of the Ancient Greeks by Jean Richer (1994). Unreliable and speculative. Jean Richers zodiacal ideas were directly inspired by his dream in Athens in 1958. Overall his zodiacal and precessional claims and conclusions are his personal fantasy.The thesis of Hamlet’s Mill is not based on an earlier thesis developed by the French occultist Jean-Charles Pichon (1920-2006) such as, Les cycles du retour éternel: essai d'une histoire thématique des religions (2 Volumes, 1963). This claim by Jean Richer (Preface, xxxiv) is false.
Star Myths of the Vikings: A New Concept of Norse Mythology (1994) by Bjorn Jonsson. (Bjorn Jonsson (1920-1995) was a physician of Icelandic descent residing in Canada. The book is riddled with errors and shows little understanding of the material. The author could not distinguish the American freemason Robert Hewitt Brown, author of Stellar Theology (1882), from the English solicitor Robert Brown Junior, author of Researches into the Origin of the Primitive Constellations of Greeks, Phoenicians and Romans (2 Volumes, 1899-1900).

language) book review by Ed Krupp in Journal for the History of Astronomy, Volume 28, 1997, Pages 353-354 for a summary of its fundamental weaknesses.)
The Secret of the Incas: Myth, Astronomy, and the War Against Time (1996) by William Sullivan. (Though erroneous, Sullivan's thesis is more coherent than that presented by von Dechend in Hamlet's Mill. See the (English-language) book review by Gerardo Aldana in Archaeoastronomy, Supplement to: Journal for the History of Astronomy, Volume 28, Number 22, 1997, Pages S88-S89. Importantly, see the informed (Englishlanguage) review essay and critique, "Time, Essential and Relative: Politics of Representation of Incas and Mayas." by Arij Ouweneel in European Review of Latin American and Caribbean Studies, Volume 67, December, 1999, Pages 95-101; and also, The Shape of Inca History by Susan Niles (1999).)
From Deluge to Discourse: Myth, History, and the Generation of Chinese Tradition (1996) by Deborah Porter. (N. J. Girardot (2002) asserts: "Recent archaeoastronomical methods especially draw upon the multicultural and interdisciplinary insights of Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend's Hamlet's Mill ...." This book is likely an example of such. Its weaknesses are obvious. It seems unnecessary to invoke Hamlet's Mill as a basis for making astronomical interpretations of early Chinese literature. On a number of occasions an astronomical basis is claimed internally within early period Chinese literature.)
Reference to article by Vlora and Tucci, 1997. Without an appropriate digital account it is difficult to find any information for the article by Vlora and Tucci. Both are identifiable as Italian academics. Vlora = Nedim Vlora, Universita degli Studi di Bari. Tucci = Giuseppe Tucci (Egyptologist?) (not Pasquale or Giulia Tucci). For the 1997 article by Vlora and Tucci see: (1) Acta Geodaetica Et Geophysica Hungarica, Volume 33, 1998 (Akadémiai Kiadó).

(Volume 29 of Interdivisional Commission on History: Newsletters of the Interdivisional Commission on History of IAGA, International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy/Issue 29 of Newsletters of the Interd. Comm. on History of IAGA). The only short description I can presently put together is: They carried out a detailed reading and (clever) interpretation of several symbols appearing in paintings within some Egyptian tombs. They claim that precession was known to Egyptian priests. They claim that they have decoded several symbols appearing in Egyptian tombs that demonstrate real measurement of equinox precession (or at least can be interpreted in terms of an apparent knowledge of precession/possible indirect evidence about the knowledge of equinox precession) by ancient Egyptians.
Homer's Secret Iliad: The Epic of the Night Skies Decoded (1999) by Florence and Kenneth Wood. (The Woods write that they visited Hertha von Dechend in Germany who supported their ideas and the publication of their book. Written and marketed for a popular (lay) readership. An astronomical interpretation of the Iliad that attempts to push its content back to circa 8000 BCE. Argues for an early equally divided 12constellation zodiac, and Greek mythology embodying knowledge of precession. Inaccurate on basic issues and quite speculative. Its claim that the Iliad is the world's oldest astronomy book, incorporating knowledge of precession, founders on its ideas of constellation antiquity i.e., the claim that our inherited Greek constellations originated in Greece and Asia Minor circa eighth millennium BCE. The Woods maintain that the astronomical content of the Iliad was forgotten with the rise of Greek scientific astronomy. "Chapter 1: Astronomy and the Ancients" comprises a variety of ideas concerning the antiquity of the constellations and lacks an underlying unity. This chapter also supports the flawed "void space" argument for the antiquity of the constellations. The "void space" argument is a simplistic substitution for the more rigorous application of historical evidence (i.e., extent cuneiform and classical texts, philological analysis of constellation names, and constellation iconography and mythology). The 200 year-old "void space" originated at a time when philology and archaeology were both under-developed and unable to be applied in any meaningful way. The main premise of the "void zone" argument is that the Classical constellations were designed at one definite time and in one place, according to a preconceived plan. The argument by Michael Ovenden (a modern proponent of the "void zone" argument) for establishing the time and place of the origin of the Aratean constellations is based on the extent of the vacant space left around the south pole of the celestial sphere when all but the Aratean constellations are removed (that is, when the post Aratean constellations are removed); and the apparent movement of the stars due to precession is taken into account. The further assumption made is that the area of the celestial globe that was not constellated in the description of Aratus was centred on the south celestial pole at the date when the constellations were fixed. The size of the "void zone" is taken as a clue to the latitude at which the constellation inventors lived. A date is found when, by allowing for precession, the centre of the "void zone" on the celestial globe in in the position of the south celestial pole. The subjectivity of the method is demonstrated by the varying



estimates of the radius of the "void zone" (30 degrees to 40 degrees) and the varying estimates of the date of origin given by precession (1400 BCE to 2800 BCE with ± varying between 200 years and 800 years). Anyway, the boundaries of the "void zone" cannot be accurately defined as we lack the understanding of the original boundaries of the Classical constellation figures. The Woods would have us believe that the central theme or plot of the Iliad concern's Homer's aim to preserve knowledge of the precession of the equinoxes and its effects (pages 63 & 219). The Woods would further have us believe that in the Iliad Homer records the passage of the autumnal equinox through 3 zodiacal constellations (and likewise the vernal equinox). This is Cancer and Capricorn circa 8000 BCE; Gemini and Sagittarius circa 6500 BCE; and Taurus and Scorpius circa 4400 BCE. We are back in Hamlet's Mill territory with the supposition of 12-constellation zodiac of equal divisions existing thousands of years prior to its known development in Mesopotamia circa 500 BCE. (However, the Woods propose an even earlier zodiac than do the authors of Hamlet's Mill!) It is suggested by the Woods (page 244) that the constellations originated in Greece and Asia Minor circa 8th-millennium BCE and were subsequently adopted by the Mesopotamians. This suggestion is required to accommodate the thesis of matching the Homeric star patterns to the geographical features of Greece and Asia Minor. (It is unlikely that imported foreign constellations from Mesopotamia could achieve such.) I am not denying that the Homeric epics contain astronomical imagery. (See: "Homeric Astronomy." by Agnes Clerke in Nature, April 21, 1887, Pages 585-588, and April 28, 1887, Pages 607-608; "Astronomical Imagery in a Passage of Homer." by Sara Genuth in JHA, 1992, Pages 293298; and "The Constellations on Achilles Shield." by Robert Hannah in Electronic Antiquity, Volume 2, Issue 4, December 1994). A major argument in the book is the 45 regiments detailed in the Iliad's famous ‘Catalogue of Ships’ in Book II, represent 45 constellations. However, the British historian and linguist Andrew Dalby writes (Rediscovering Homer (2006, Page 39)): "The catalogue evidently began simply as a list of Greek cities ...." A strange manner for Homer to begin a hypothesised intention of cataloging constellations. A major argument in the book is the 45 regiments detailed in the Iliad's famous ‘Catalogue of Ships’ in Book II, represent 45 constellations. That the Iliad is allegory and was set in the sky is not a new idea. allegorical interpretations of Homer go back to at least to the Neoplatonic philosopher Porphyry of Tyre in the 6th-century CE. Publications propounding an astronomical interpretation of Homer's epics have existed for over 200 years. Charles Dupuis (L'origine de tous les cultes (1795)) held that the Iliad, Odyssey and the Voyage of Argo most likely described the voyage of the sun (or its representative planet) through the zodiacal constellations. Homer as allegory was also discussed by proponents of the 19th-century"sun-myth" school. Astronomical interpretations of mythology (often incorporating precession as the "key") have been extensively promoted in numerous books published between circa 1880 and 1930. William Warren's Paradise Found (1898) was meant as a new contribution to Homeric astronomy/cosmology. Interestingly Anton Krichenbauer in his Theogonie und Astronomie (1881) interpreted the Iliad as an allegorical history of a calendar reform needed circa 2110 BCE because of the precessional movement of the equinoxes. Perhaps the first book solely discussing the "astro-mythic" interpretation of the Iliad is The Judgment of Paris by Emmeline Plunket (1908). In this she was possibly influenced by the nature myth interpretation of Homer incorporated by William Gladstone in his Landmarks of Homeric Study (1890). Perhaps the heftiest proponent of astral mythology furnishing the key to Homer was the Panbabylonist Carl Fries in his Studien zur Odyssee (2 volumes, 1910-1911), and Die griechischen Gotter und Heroen (1911). The Panbabylonist Peter Jensen held some similar astral ideas in his Mythen und Epen (1900), and Das Gilamesch-Epos in der Weltliteratur (2 volumes, 1906-1929). Even Arthur Drews in his Der Sternhimmel (1923) makes passing reference to an astronomical interpretation of Homer. It was also discussed by proponents of the 19th-century "sun myth" school. The minister and author Abraham Palmer (1847-1922) was probably the last real exponent of the "sun myth" school. At least his book The Sampson-Saga and its Place in Comparative Religion (1913) was probably the last substantial effort. (Interestingly, Metrodorus of Lampsacus (circa 5th-century BCE) identified Hector as the moon, Achilles as the sun, Agamemnon as the earth, and Helena as the air.) Historically, proponents of a scheme of astronomical mythology (nearly always based on an equally divided 12-constellation zodiac) have ceaselessly demonstrated that it is possible to incorporate a diverse and differing range of astronomical data into their interpretations. Almost all the authors interpret the same mythology or epics with different astronomical data i.e., identify different astronomical phenomenon. Simply, an "astro-mythic" scheme can bear several several interpretations. (It is interesting to see the apparently Jungian "astro-mythic" slant given to Hebrew mythology by Tom Chetwynd in his The Age of Myth (1991).) Such multitude of divergence indicates that the methodology is flawed or that the interpretations are forced. In a nutshell: The problem is no "astronomical key" has been identified - as is evidenced by the diverse astronomical methods of interpretation. This facilitates the criticism that often the method(s) of "astro-mythic" interpretation is perhaps not a method after all. A reasonable analogy would perhaps be the elaborate "Bacon is Shakespeare" ciphers that have been "discovered". What stands out is the fact that the coding systems and underlying identification messages are never the same. The 2 volumes by Ignatius Donnelly titled The Great Cryptogram (1888) are a prime example. John Nicolson's book No Ciphers in Shakespeare (1888) showed that the cipher scheme "discovered" by Ignatius Donnelly can be used to produce any required result. Likewise, elements within a single scheme of astronomical mythology can produce several variant interpretations. Two "recent" publications using the same tale in the context of Hamlet's Mill (1969) are Heavens Unearthed in Nursery Rhymes and Fairy Tales by Matt Kane (1999) and Imaginery Landscapes: Making Worlds of Myth and Science by William Thompson (1989). Both authors refer to Hamlet's Mill: An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time. In
"Chapter 5: Rumpelstiltskin" of Kane's book he interprets the tale as a lunar myth. In "Chapter 1: Rapunzel: Cosmology Lost" of Thompson's book he interprets the tale as involving the sun and moon and the planetary motion of Mercury, Venus and Mars. The importance of the ecliptic and the development of the equally divided 12-constellation zodiac does not appear until after the start of the Persian Period in Mesopotamia (circa 500 BCE). The evidence indicates that it was the astronomy of the Babylonian Mul.Apin scheme (circa 1000 BCE) that established the preconditions for the importance of the ecliptic and the establishment of the Babylonian zodiacal scheme which was later adopted by the Greeks. The Babylonian scheme of 12 zodiacal constellations was derived from a system of 18 constellations (established during the Assyrian Period, starting circa 1100 BCE) along the ecliptic to mark the path of the moon. The question remains how can a late Babylonian zodiac (developed circa 450 BCE) comprised of 12 constellations (and 12 equal divisions) have been in use by Homer some 300 years earlier? (And also have had an even earlier origin circa 8000 BCE - which is well prior to the existence of both the Sumerian and Babylonian civilizations.) This point can be expanded further. Babylonian constellations of the 2nd-millennium BCE appear in the Greek constellation scheme of Aratus. (The few known constellations of Homer mirror the constellations already existing in the Babylonian scheme.) The Aratean constellations also show a similarity with the later Babylonian constellations listed in Mul.Apin. A definite Babylonian influence on the Greek scheme of constellations is reasonably indicated. If the constellations originated as a set circa 2000-2800 BCE then they cannot have originated with the Greeks. However, the latitude at which the constellations were believed to have originated as a single scheme cannot refer to Mesopotamia because at this time their scheme of constellations was a mix of constellations mentioned by Aratus and other constellations outside this scheme. Crediting the Minoans, as Michael Ovenden did, as the makers of the Classical constellations and offering explanations based on the destruction of Minoan civilisation and the later ineptitude of the Greeks as observers are not convincing. For a whole different line of speculation see: The Iliad as Politics by Dean Hammer (2002). An outstanding recent study, that clarifies its indebtedness to West Semitic myth, is The Iliad: Structure, Myth, and Meaning by Bruce Louden (2006).)
Homer's Secret Odyssey (2011) by Florence Wood and Kenneth Wood. [Note: An astronomical interpretation of The Odyssey. Relies on many of the false assumptions made in their previous book, and introduces new ones. The authors state the book involves a "... challenging new reading of the [Odyssey] narrative ...." The authors state the book falls under archaeoastronomy; correctly, the category would be pseudo-history. There is nothing new in inflated claims and astronomical/calendrical interpretations for Homer's epic poems. I would not support the claim that Edna Leigh did pioneering studies and that her work falls under archaeoastronomy. I would support the claim that she set out a fantasy-theory. A number of the book's ideas are not exclusive to Edna Leigh. Without making the list exhaustive the following works are interesting. The British classicist Gilbert Murray recognized (without inflated claims) calendrical numbers in The Odyssey; see: pages 210-212 "Odyssey and the Calendar" in The Rise of the Greek Epic (3rd edition, 1924). The German classicist/philologist Carl Fries conducted an astronomical interpretation (followed the solar mythology school and the tenets of Panbabylonism) of the Odyssey; see: Studien zur Odysee (2 volumes, 1910-1911). Earlier, the British writer



Emmeline Plunket (now genuinely forgotten) did a calendrical analysis of the Odyssey; see: pages 127-144 "Odyseuss" in The Judgment of Paris and Some Other Legends Astronomically Considered (1908). Earlier, George St. Clair (Myths of Greece Explained and Dated (2 volumes, 1901)) suggested an astronomical interpretation of Homer. St. Clair (now genuinely forgotten) pioneered the use of simply assuming an early equallyspaced 12-constellation zodiac to explain mythology. The technique reached its zenith with the book Hamlet's Mill (1969). It is a technique used in Homer's Secret Iliad (1999). One of numerous persons to claim a secret navigational code in the Odyssey was the French amateur sailor Gilbert Pillot; see: The Secret Code of the Odyssey: Did the Greeks Sail the Atlantic? (1969, English translation by Francis Albert 1972). The author seeks to prove that the voyages of Ulysses were located in the Atlantic Ocean, not the Mediterranean Sea. The author is heavily reliant on the use of the zodiacal system claimed by Jean Richer whose zodiacal ideas were directly inspired by his dream in Athens in 1958. Earlier the American patent lawyer Henriette Mertz (an adherent of cultural diffusion through early voyaging) decided 'yes'; see: The Wine Dark Sea (1964). See also: Islands in the Sky: The Four-Dimensional Journal of Odysseus through Space and Time (2012) by Rose Hammond. See the sympathetic but also at times critical (English-language) book review by Francisco Vaz de Silva (Folklorist/Anthropologist, University of Lisbon) in Cosmos, Volume 30, 2014, Pages 193-195. The content of the book is a completely different approach to that taken by Homer's Secret Odyssey (2011) by Florence and Kenneth Wood.]
The Celestial Key to the Vedas: Discovering the Origins of the World's Oldest Civilization (1999) by B. G. Sidharth. (The author states the
conclusions of Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend are just the tip of the iceberg.

Several interpretations are based on the natural sciences. Recently, however, as far as the construction of the passage is concerned, renewed attention has been given to the possible role of religious customs, mythology and omens in connection with ancient military strategy. Against this background, the sun and moon are viewed as deities and told to remain passive in the battle. Omen texts from Mesopotamia related to warfare, and based on the "favourable" or "unfavourable" position of the sun and moon, seem to have impacted on the passage as welL Others have interpreted the sun in terms of mythical and/or theological categories. his paper avers that an interpretation in terms of the mythical millwheel may help to explain the meaning of the passage."

When They Severed Earth From Sky (2004) by Elizabeth Barber and Paul Barber. (Paul Barber is an archaeologist and his wife Elizabeth Barber is a linguist. ES, April 21, 2013 (http://skepticalhumanities.com/category/critical-thinking/): ".... Considering their focus on oral cultures, the very short-shrift the Barbers give to some of the most important scholars of oral tradition is somewhat disturbing. Neither Walter Ong nor his extremely influential book Orality and Literacy merit a mention. Nor do Eric A. Havelock or John Miles Foley. Even Milman Parry and Alfred Lord receive only the briefest of mentions, and Lord's monumentally important work, The Singer of Tales, is not mentioned at all. On the other hand, they seriously cite other works of a slightly more fringey nature, such as Hamlet’s Mill, by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend. In seeking to find explanations for mythological stories in natural phenomena or real events, they seem to give credence to highly questionable tales. Take, for instance, their discussion of the Golden Calf: “What's that all about? Why a calf?” (Barber and Barber, chap. 3). They gently nudge us toward the correct answer through the Socratic method: Where had the Children of Israel been living? In Egypt, of course–the country from which they were escaping after centuries of servitude. One can reasonably conjecture that in all that time they had absorbed something of their captors' culture. (Barber and Barber, chap. 3). The Golden Calf, they suggest, derives from the Egyptian conception of the sky as a giant cow-goddess, "which could well have been known by folk who had lived in ancient Egypt for centuries. . . . In worshipping [sic] a Golden Calf at dawn, the Children of Israel would simply be reverting to Egyptian sun-worship: they were probably relieved that the sun finally came up, after all that thundering during the night" (Barber and Barber, chap. 3). They seem to be suggesting that the story of the Exodus is historically true to some significant degree: the Children of Israel were kept enslaved in Egypt; they escaped during a time of dark portents; they wandered in the desert, and, in difficult times, they began to worship the deities of their captors. There’s just one teeny-tiny problem with this: the stunning lack of documentary, historical or archeological evidence that a large number of Israelites were enslaved in Egypt or that they wandered through the desert for forty years. The Barbers make a number of dubious arguments (flood stories are really about the precession of the equinoxes), and, even when there may be some truth to their theories, their interpretations are monolithic and reductive, suggesting that there is a single source for a given myth, a single answer to a complex question. ...." A somewhat sympathetic and uninformed book review by Michael Shermer appeared in American Scientist, Volume 93, Number 3, May-June, 2005. Elizabeth Barber was invited by Michael Shermer to speak as part of the Skeptics Society’s Distinguished Speakers Lecture Series. The blurb on the video containing the lecture states (Elizabeth Wayland Barber. When They Severed Earth from Sky: How the Human Mind Shapes Myth. Skeptics Society Distinguished Speakers Lecture Series, California Institute of Technology, March 6, 2005. DVD.): "How could anyone think that mortals like Perseus, Beowulf, and St. George actually fought dragons, since dragons don't exist? Strange though they sound, however, these "myths" did not begin as fiction. Barber shows that myths originally transmitted real information about real events and observations, preserving the information sometimes for millennia within nonliterate societies.")

Exploring Ancient Skies: An Encyclopedic Survey of Archaeoastronomy by David Kelley and Eugene Milone (2005; 2nd edition 2011). (David
Kelley was a Canadian archaeologist and epigrapher who specialised in Mesoamerica, especially the Maya. Upon retirement David Kelley (19242011) was Professor Emeritus, Department of Archaeology, University of Calgary. The astronomer Eugene (Gene) Milone (1939- ) was born in the USA and later moved to Canada. Upon retirement Eugene Milone was Director Emeritus, Rothney Astrophysical Observatory, and Professor Emeritus Physics and Astronomy Department, University of Calgary. Milone primarily wrote the material on technical astronomy. Kelley wrote the rest. Interestingly, the authors state that to their knowledge the only attempt to treat myths as astronomical systems on a world-wide basis is Hamlet's Mill (1969) by de Santillana and von Dechend. This demonstrates their lack of understanding of the basis for the book, which the contents and bibliography clearly show is the German star myth school and its derivative Panbabylonism. The book is obviously sympathetic to the speculations in Hamlet's Mill. David Kelley was a brilliant scholar. However, he held many speculative ideas relating to calendars and archaeoastronomy. He was a "diffusionist" of the "old school" and wrote on many "fringe" topics. Old school diffusionism = Wherever a story which consists of the same combination of several elements is found in 2 regions (geographic locations), it must be concluded that its occurrence in both is due to diffusion. This applied to many of his ideas about the relationships between world-wide calendar systems and his ideas about



archaeoastronomy. Kelley's sections of the book supports the idea of worldwide communications in the far past. Also, Kelley's sections give a large amount of space to numerous dubious claims that challenge orthodox history for no suitable reasons.)

The Mathisen Corollary (2011) by David Mathisen. (The author is another 'tub thumping' amateur historian promoting his particular brand of pseudo-history.) See also his more recent efforts: Mathisen, David. (2015-2016). Star Myths of the World and how to interpret them, 3 Volumes. (An amateur's approach to interpreting world myths and stories in a manner similar to Alvin Kuhn (1880-1963) (an American theosophist/occultist). Interprets myths as celestial metaphor/spiritual symbolism. The approach also reminds me of the pantheist Dorothy Murdock (1960-2015, sadly, she died of breast cancer) who also liked to believe she was an expert on religion, mythology, and spiritual traditions. She mostly used outdated late 19th-century and early 20th-century amateur freethought sources to construct her books.) Non-academic (amateur) history is now engaged in by a multitude of persons who seek to give their own preferred 'alternative' explanations in the conviction they are more accurate and 'truthful' than the perspective of so-called conventional history. David Mathisen imposes a single explanation (precessional astronomy) on immensely varied myths regardless of their location, context or provenance. The notion that one key or kind of key would explain all myths has long been abandoned by most scholars. However, amongst laypersons natural phenomena is still being proposed as the key to all mythologies. In his book The Mathisen Corollary we have the fantasy that experts do not know best but that Mathisen does, and his theory - based on the catastrophic geological hydroplate model proposed by the creationist Walt Brown to refute evolution and defend Biblical literalism and the Noahic flood - "completely changes our understanding of mankind's ancient past." Mathisen believes that conventional academics/historians are co-operatively involved in suppressing the true history of humankind (and substituting it with 'conventional' history). Just when this began and how it succeeds in being perpetuated is not given a convincing explanation. However, Mathisen believes he not only can see through this but that he also has knowledge of the true history of humankind and its ancient wisdom. "The world's sacred traditions share a common system of celestial metaphor .... Details of it have been systematically analyzed most thoroughly perhaps by the Reverend Robert Taylor of England (1784-1844), working with the stories found in the scriptures we call the Old and New Testaments of the Bible." (Star Myths of the World, and how to interpret them by David Mathisen (Volume 1, 2015, Page 1.) The 2 volumes of discourses by Taylor that Mathisen most admires are: The Devil's Pulpit, or Astro-Theological Sermons (1857), and Astronomico-Theological Lectures (1857). In The Undying Stars (2014, Page i), Mathisen begins with quotes from Gerald Massey and Alvin Boyd Kuhn. (The full book title is: The Undying Stars, the truth that unites the world’s ancient wisdom, and the conspiracy to keep it from you.) Gerald Massey (1828-1907) was a British poet and spiritualist without any formal education. Alvin Kuhn (1880-1963) was an American theosophist/occultist. He was very much influenced by the work of Gerald Massey and Godfrey Higgins. (I have had copies of books by Robert Taylor, Gerald Massey, and Alvin Kuhn for some 50 years. They fall within the freethought genre. None are useful.) Regarding Mathisen's admiration for Robert Taylor. Mathisen seems to think that his acceptance of Taylor simply validates Taylor's essays. Why the later German star myth school is ignored is somewhat puzzling. It appears that Mathisen does not read German. Robert Taylor's essays are worthless. Alvin Kuhn is heavily reliant on Gerald Massey. Neither Taylor or Kuhn can be classed as scholars. Taylor's scholarship (largely an astronomical critique of the gospels) has been described as "phantasmagoria of misplaced erudition." Kuhn simply uses Massey as an authority. Taylor was eccentric and his astronomical critique of the gospels remains bizarre. (I have had multiple copies Taylor's works for 50 years. They fall within the freethought genre.) By 1824, when he came to London, Taylor was a BA graduate of St John's College, Cambridge, qualified and experienced surgeon (4 years training (apprenticeship) with a Birmingham surgeon), an ordained Church of England clergyman, a schoolteacher, and a journalist. At one time Robert Taylor, a radical clergyman and former deist turned radical freethinker, delivered esoteric mythological sermons (later published as essays) several times a week from the Blackfriars Rotunda in London. Taylor combined irreligion with ultra-radical politics. He believed all religions were fictions constructed from codes of astronomical and astrological symbols. Also, Christianity developed from Egyptian religions. These ideas were also set out in his Syntagma (1828) and Diegesis (1829). Taylor's ideas were clearly based on late 18th-century French freethought books, especially Ruins of Empire by Count Constantine de Volney, and The Origin of all Religious Worship by Charles Dupuis. His Sunday evening theatrical performances (involving outlandish dress, numerous props, exaggerated gestures, and burlesque on Anglican ceremony) of "Astronomico-Theological" discourses on Christianity were repeated during the week. His voice and ranting delivery were modelled on the actor Charles Kemble. One assessment of Taylor (Radical Expression, Page 137) states: "Taylor was a fop, a dandy, a boozer, and a womanizer - a man of almost uncontrolled excess." Taylor also associated with people deemed to be of questionable character.
Mathisen is now (2017) engaged in widening how he communicates his beliefs. Posted October 12, 2017 to The Mathisen Corollary: "The New Academy of Celestial Mythology & Ancient Wisdom commences this Saturday, October 14 with a live, three-hour web-based course on the celestial mythology of the Bible. I will be leading the discussion and using visual images, diagrams, star charts, and planetarium software to help explain how the system works, how specific stories and characters in the scriptures of the Old and New Testament correspond to constellations and other heavenly bodies, and how those celestial actors relate to the profound message contained in the ancient texts. There will be plenty of time for questions and discussion, and by the end of the class you should be equipped to begin to converse with the ancient myths yourself in the language that they are actually speaking, as well as to see connections between the stories and figures found in the Bible and those found in the other



amazing ancient myths, scriptures and sacred stories from around the world. You will also see the stars in a new light the next time you are able to go out and view the heavens in person. To reserve your place in the course, please visit the sign-up page here. The live class will begin this Saturday at 10am Pacific time, which is the same as 1pm Eastern time and 5pm (1700) UTC. Posted by David Warner Mathisen at 10:56 AM." Clearly, Mathisen believes himself to be correct, even if nobody else says so.
Mathisen (and others of the same ilk (New Age history)) would do well to pay attention to the bizarre thesis in The Discovery of Genesis: How the Truths of Genesis Were Found Hidden in the Chinese Language by C. H. Kang and Ethel R. Nelson (1979), and Genesis and the Mystery
Confucius Couldn’t Solve by Ethel R. Nelson and Richard E. Broadberry (1994). The authors attempt to show that the book of Genesis encoded in the Chinese language. The authors analyse the oldest Chinese ideographs to 'reveal' that ancient Chinese history includes biblical events from creation to the flood. The Chinese, as they left the Tower of Babel, embed the story of creation to the flood in their language. However, the Bible is their presupposition: their axiomatic "starting point" from which they interpret the world around them. Also, the arguments of the authors have nothing whatsoever to do with the way Chinese characters have been created historically and have functioned. Chinese language developed from divination symbols used on the so-called oracle bones. The symbols/inscriptions used in divining practice with oracle bones became words and a recognizable (extended) Chinese script developed. Most of the oracle bones discovered come from the Shang Dynasty (circa 1600-1046 BCE). Also, importantly, Humans have an eye for finding 'patterns.' This is a problem when patterns are identified that don't really exist - or when specific meanings are superimposed on something very vague. Also, it is a well-known psychological phenomenon that once there is the conviction that a pattern is present, then everything will seem to confirm it, even if objectively there is nothing there.
Mathisen does not engage in balanced discussions of historical material. As examples:
(1) In The Undying Stars (Page 27), Mathisen writes: "... but for sheer comprehensive explication of the celestial metaphors in the Bible, the Reverend Taylor (who was imprisoned for his efforts) is hard to beat." This simply avoids the fact that Taylor was twice convicted of blasphemy for which he twice served time in prison (1828-1829; 1831-1833). At this time blasphemy was a criminal offence. Taylor was basically "preaching" Bible mythicism based on the publications of Dupuis and Volney. Taylor's theatrical spoofs on religious services during his lectures were quite wild. He dressed as a bishop, parodied Anglican church services, and made outrageously blasphemous comments on Christian rituals or the Scriptures. It was Taylor's theatrical actions involving mockery of Christianity - not his Bible mythicism - that led to his being twice charged with blasphemy, and his sentences to imprisonment. At the Rotunda his theatrics on the Bible was accompanied by 12 zodiacal emblems painted on the dome overhead, a large board carrying Greek 'hieroglyphs,' a mechanical pointer, an illuminated globe, and a clockwork orrery. Sometimes he was accompanied by a female chorus playing guitars. His Rotunda performances on Bible mythicism encompassed spoofs, burlesque, buffoonery, satire, parody, and ridicule. Taylor had no problem filling the Rotunda with his style of theatre/show. He was not involved in the serious education of the London working class.
(2) Promoting the Ruamahanga (Ruamahunga) River Skull in New Zealand as causing major problems for conventional historical timelines, instead of the most likely explanation of it being evidence of a Dutch shipwreck survivor - there was a lot of Dutch sailing activity at this time, especially along the coast of Australia and to Indonesia - forgoes a critical approach. DNA testing has identified the skull as European rather than Maori. Also, the shape of the skull indicates a European rather than Maori origin. (The ethnicity of the skull was determined using anatomical metrics. However, a large portion of the cranium is missing.) At best the Ruamahunga River Skull - discovered 2004 - could rewrite the history of European presence in New Zealand prior to the arrival of James Cook in 1769 and Abel Tasman in 1642. Using radio carbon dating the skull is dated to the first half of the 16th-century. Unfortunately radio carbon dating is not very reliable. Also, the Ruamahanga River Skull has no archaeological provenance. In 2009, Marcus Boroughs, director of the Aratoi – Wairarapa's Museum of Art and History, stated he had been informed the skull may have been taken from a medical school in Wellington and thrown off a bridge into the river in the mid 1970s. See: "A PreTasman Shipwreck?" by Robin Watt. In: Shipwrecks of New Zealand by Lynton Diggle and Charles Ingram (8th edition, 2009). In the 15th-century the Portuguese were frequent voyagers to India and the East. Records of the early Portuguese voyages to the region of Australia were destroyed in the Lisbon earthquake and fire of 1755. It is thought possible that the Portuguese in the early 16th-century discovered Australia. In the 16thcentury the Spanish were frequent voyagers in the Pacific. In the first half of the 17th-century the Dutch were frequent voyagers to the Pacific. In the 18th-century the French and British were frequent voyagers to the Pacific. Women were in the Pacific in the late 16th-century. In 1595 Doña Ysabel Barreto Mendaña accompanied her husband on his search for the Solomon Islands. The first woman to circumnavigate the globe, Jeanne Baret, did so disguised as a man. In 1766, she sailed on the French ship La Boudeuse as servant to its naturalist, Philibert Commerson. Dutch traders/merchants brought their wives with them to Indonesia. From circa 1600 to 1750, Holland had the largest merchant fleet of any nation. In the mid 17th-century the Dutch were exploring the western Australian coast. Exploration by Dutch ships off Australia was soon followed by Spanish and Portuguese ships. A problem was navigational longitude couldn't be accurately measured until the mid-18th century. Until then finding longitude at sea was mostly guesswork. In order to estimate an approximate idea of longitude navigators used dead reckoning (which depended on measuring the ship's speed = distance travelled over a specific period of time). The problem of longitude was particularly problematic on long voyages out of sight of land. Southern charts were inaccurate and incomplete. Longitude errors could involve hundreds of nautical miles. Shipwrecks were common. The requirement for far more evidence is being overlooked. The pre-Tasman shipwreck/castaway explanation is more likely. Perhaps the woman was a descendant of the union of a Maori woman and a European sailor. Radio carbon testing suggests the person died some time between 1674 and 1742. Both James Cook and Joseph Banks believed the Dutch had sent other ships to New Zealand soon after Abel Tasman's discoveries. Also, the Dutch ship Ridderschap van Holland, which left Capetown in 1694, vanished on its voyage to Australia. If it was demasted off the southern Australian coast the prevailing currents would have carried it to the western coast of New Zealand. Demasting would limit capabilities to maneuver. See: Pre-Tasman Portuguese Down Under? by John Tasker (2012); Sixteenth Century Portuguese Down Under by John Tasker (3 Volumes, 2012); and Quest Aotearoa by John Tasker (2 Volumes, 2014; see Volume 2). Note: The author does make some errors.
(3) According to David Mathisen (The Mathisen Corollary, Wednesday, May 4, 2011), Darwinian evolution is simply wrong and Darwinian evolution is a religion. This is simply fantasy. The single compelling evidence for evolution is DNA. Today Darwin's theory, brought up to date by genetics is stronger than ever in the scientific community. Darwin did not know about genetic mutations, he did not know about Mendelian genetics, and he did not know molecular genetics. Mathisen is not a geneticist. Regardless of the professional qualifications lacked by Mathisen it is obvious that he considers his views to be the correct interpretation of world history and ancient mythology. Also, he demonstrates his overconfidence by choosing to speak as an authority and being quite dogmatic in his views. However, Mathisen basically uses force-fitting to generate evidence to fit his views - he simply subjectively reinterprets the existing evidence/myths to fit his preconceived views. The views of opponents are condemned. A tactic Mathisen uses is known as "elephant hurling." Elephant hurling is a discussion/debate tactic in which a participant/debater will refer to a large body of evidence which supposedly supports the participant's/debater's arguments, but without demonstrating that all the evidence does indeed support the argument. Put another way: Elephant hurling occurs when the critic throws summary arguments about complex issues to give the impression of weighty evidence, but with an unstated presumption that a large complex of underlying ideas is true, and failing to consider opposing data, usually because they have uncritically accepted the arguments from their own side.
It may seem unacceptable to Mathisen that he is not taken seriously by specialist scholars but that is a problem only for himself. The issue is the establishment of credibility.

Astrology and Cosmology in Early China: Conforming Earth to Heaven (2013) by David Pankenier. (It has been pointed out that many of
Pankenier's arguments can be speculative, based on a limited range of clues and even concepts from later eras. Pankenier describes (page 3) de Santillana and von Dechend's Hamlet's Mill as "controversial but inspired." The book has been controversial but its weaknesses are readily evident; it offers no original inspiration but merely a repetition of Panbabylonism. Pankenier's key belief (the 'linchpin' of the book (see page 12) is there a link between multiple planetary groupings (especially five planets in close proximity) with dynastic transitions and the notion of the ruler's 'mandate of heaven'. In Chapter 6, 'The Cosmo-Political Mandate,' Pankenier widens and deepens the scope of his theory. The theory has both supporters and critics. See the critical (English-language) book review by the Sinologist Daniel Patrick Morgan (CNRS – Université Paris Diderot) in Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Volume 77, Issue 2, June, 2014, Pages 404-406.)
"A Reinvestigation Into Astronomical Motifs in Eddic Poetry, with Particular Reference to Óðinn's Encounters with Two Giantesses: Billings Mær and Gunnlöð." by Dorian Knight (Culture and Cosmos, Volume 17, Issue 1, 2013). ("Abstract: Archaeological and literary scholarship on Old Norse/Icelandic astronomy has been very scarce. This is no doubt due to what has been perceived as a lack of transparent evidence. Within this article I will re-evaluate how astronomical knowledge can be uncovered in Old Norse/Icelandic literary sources by analyzing mythologically problematic stanzas within Eddic Poem Hávamál. Stanzas 96-110 of Hávamál tell of a self-contained mythic narrative concerning the god Óðinn's attempted seduction of two giantesses, Billings Mær and Gunnlöð. Using the analytic tools of cultural astronomy and a wide range of philological, cultural and medieval and modern ethnographic evidence as well as insights into other areas of Old Icelandic poetry, I suggest the following: that the relevant stanzas of Hávamál contain two complementary love stories fundamentally connected to the movement of the waxing and the waning of the moon. We can therefore understand the kernel of this myth as a description of what could be seen in the night sky, although the story is couched in the terms of an aphoristic tale, at the centre of which men and women's deceitfulness towards each other is portrayed with a comic twist. My conclusion is therefore that it may be possible to interpret certain myths in the Poetic Edda in the light of a technical language that encodes astronomical information through allegory. Therefore, although it may at first seem unusual to locate Old Norse gods in the real-world observations of the night sky, we can choose to read them as a way of describing what is going on in the sky using mythological language."

"Snorri's Edda: The Sky Described in Mythological Terms." by Gísli Sigurðsson. In: Nordic Mythologies: Interpretations, Intersections, and Institutions edited by Timothy Tangherlini. (2014, Pages 184-198). (The authors theme indicates that he is influenced by Hamlet's Mill, but apparently he does not advocate precessional mythology. Abstract: "Mythologies from around the world all have an astronomical aspect to them in the sense that they reflect detailed knowledge and observation of the sky above. All over the world people have used mythological language to talk about and share astronomical knowledge among the learned elites of all cultures; knowledge about the movements of the sun, the moon and the planets within the ever revolving firmament around the fixed points in the extreme north and south. It can be demonstrated, from celestial observations in 19th century Icelandic tradition, that certain ideas in Old Norse mythology referred directly to peculiar celestial phenomena. In view of that actual proof it should be worth discussing the possibility of taking that idea a step further and read the entire Snorri's Edda as a mythological interpretation of the world as it appears to the naked eye: The earth below and the sky above where the stars and other heavenly bodies move around, as well as up and down, some in a clearly regular pattern and others less so, day and night. This approach changes radically all our discussion about systematic thought behind the individual myths as well as about their source value as reflections of pre-Christian ideas in the north. In my paper I shall read Gylfaginning (Gylfi's Illusion) as a general introduction to what can literally be observed in the sky where, as Snorri tells us 82 times, we should be looking for the gods. Gylfi's illusion in the frame-story is therefore to think that he is observing what he is being told about the gods and their dwellings and the world tree in the sky when, in fact, all he sees with his mortal eyes is the stars, the planets, the Sun and the Moon, and the Milky way; with occasional celestial phenomena such as the rainbow, sun-/moon haloes and eclypses (sic), all of which have their mythological equivalent and "can be seen from Earth" as Gylfaginning (ch. 11) puts it when explaining the children Bil and Hiuki, well known as moon-dogs in English."

The opening speculative paragraph and speculative/erroneous parts of the contents show the influence of Hamlet's Mill. Argues that the mythology of Snorra Edda (Snorri's Edda) is built on an old tradition and should not be read as a learned construction from the time of Snorri Sturluson.

"Decoding European Palaeolithic art: Extremely ancient knowledge of precession of the equinoxes." by Martin Sweatman and Alistair Coombs (2018). (Athens Journal of History [online], 2018, Pages 1-30). Unreliable. (Note: 30 pages. Abstract: "A consistent interpretation is provided for zoomorphic artworks at Neolithic Göbekli Tepe and Çatalhöyük as well as European Palaeolithic cave art. It appears they all display the same method for recording dates based on precession of the equinoxes, with animal symbols representing an ancient zodiac. The same constellations are used today in the West, although some of the zodiacal symbols are different. In particular, the Shaft Scene at Lascaux is found to have a similar meaning to Pillar 43 at Göbekli Tepe. Both can be viewed as memorials of catastrophic encounters with the Taurid meteor stream, consistent with Clube and Napier's theory of coherent catastrophism. The date of the likely comet strike recorded at Lascaux is 15,150 ± 200 BC, corresponding closely to the onset of a climate event recorded in a Greenland ice core. A survey of radiocarbon dates of these animal symbols from Chauvet and other Palaeolithic caves is consistent with this zodiacal interpretation with an extraordinary level of statistical significance. Finally, the Lion Man of Hohlenstein-Stadel, circa 38,000 BC, is also consistent with this interpretation, indicating this knowledge is extremely ancient and was widespread."

A recent appraisal by an 'archaeoastronomer'
A sympathetic and somewhat considered approach to Hamlet’s Mill appears in Mysteries and Discoveries of Archaeoastronomy: From Giza to Easter Island by Giulio Magli (2005; English-language edition 2009). See: Section 14.4 The Problem of the Code; Pages 274-276. Giulio Magli, born 1964, is an Italian astrophysicist and 'archaeoastronomer.' He has particular expertise in mathematical physics and is on the staff at the Politecnico di Milano. Giulio Magli gives several examples of how information can be codified but the Inca Quipu is perhaps the only really relevant example. However, none of it relates to precessional knowledge. However, he makes some contentious statements such as: "The first scholars to systematically investigate the idea that mythology contains a code for the transmission of astronomical knowledge were Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend in their study Hamlet’s Mill (1983). The Mill is a highly complex book, written by two people with encyclopedic knowledge that enables them to move about in space and time with balletic ease. It has often been misinterpreted, particularly by those driven to expose at all costs its mystical or blatantly ahistorical aspects." Why the 1983 Italian-language edition is solely referred - without being suitably identified - to is not known. Magli apparently does not understand that Hamlet's Mill is a repeat of the basic tenets of the German star-myth School and Panbabylonism at the turn of the 20th-century. What Magli also apparently fails to appreciate - and he certainly does not raise the issue - is an equally divided 12-constellation zodiac is late i.e., is demonstratively Babylonian and dates to the last half of the 1stmillennium BCE. The term "highly complex book" = "highly complex mess in presentation of its thesis." Magli further states: "Hamlet's Mill offers a great number of hints to support ... [its] thesis, covering all imaginable times and places and cultures, invariably finding the same images, the same numbers, and the same mythological structures." That von Dechend achieves this using Eduard Stucken's uncritical methods is not examined. Page 276: "However, these hints lead us into extremely perilous terrain, in the sense there is nothing more intellectually reckless than to trust analogical reasoning based on images, numbers, or the roots of names. Images, such as the "wheel" that makes the world turn, which de Santillana and Von (sic) Dechend find just about everywhere, can have different meanings in different places. Numbers, such as 72 - the number of years that must pass in order to observe a single degree of precessional movement - typically depend on the unit of measure being used (in this case the measure of the angles in degrees), which varies from culture to culture. Finding the same numbers in different times and places therefore means, in and of itself, absolutely nothing, though this does not stem the flood of ink that continues to be spilled in the name of “numerology." Lastly, shared or similar etymological roots can be no less misleading, for they may have been influenced or modified in ways that are impossible for us to know, or they may simply be coincidental. The main thesis of Hamlet's Mill, therefore, is to be considered not as demonstrated in the text but rather presented in a reasonable way, and remains untethered to the massive amounts of quantitative research that would be necessary to either prove or disprove it. For example, Sellers (1993) concentrates on predynastic Egypt, seeking to determine the origin of the myth of Osiris's death and resurrection in precessional terms. Seller's work, however, though interesting, employs the same method as Hamlet's Mill and therefore fails to demonstrate its validity, the same applies to Sullivan’s (1996) work on the Incas" The main thesis of Hamlet's Mill is not presented in a reasonable way. It never examines the origin of the zodiac or even seeks to establish its claim for the existence of a 12-constellation equally-divided Neolithic zodiac. It simply assumes such a zodiac existed.
The strange case of David Mathisen's claimed 'rebuttal'
Apart from wrongly accusing me of making ad hominem attacks (the nature of which he clearly does not understand) Mathisen has not challenged any of the details in the article itself. Mathisen may simply not know how to do a proper critique.
The contents of this critique obviously shocks and disturbs most devotees. Hamlet's Mill devotees believe they should not be offended by critical comments, and are appalled by the use of words such as rubbish, bunk, and pseudoscience (which they believe I use). (Neither do I use the word stupid.) This is more fantasy on their part and a demonstration that they do not check their facts. In this book length essay the words rubbish and bunk are not used (and have not been used). The word pseudoscience is used twice but not in connection with Hamlet's Mill. The particular critic has obviously not read this critique at all. Little wonder I am appalled that they consider themselves qualified to rewrite history. In this essay I basically discuss how Hamlet's Mill came to be written, why it was incompetently written (lack of expertise of the authors, use of out-of-date sources), and what it owes to Panbabylonism (and I summarise 22 corresponding themes). My tone has not been intemperate yet it is the perception of my tone that so-called critics of the critique have (and want) to restrict themselves too. Apparently I should be writing more reverentially simply in order to satisfy the convictions and emotional needs of devotees.
David Mathisen is an offended devotee. (Overlooked is the fact that for decades supporters of Hamlet's Mill have been name-calling critics of the book. Apparently, all critics who dismiss the book are "small-minded individuals" and most are "intimidated" by the central thesis of the book and have "unrealistic expectations." Also they are constantly offing the scholarly establishment without themselves having subject-related academic expertise and credibility.) Hamlet's Mill believers become quite angry when their masters - de Santillana and von Dechend - are criticised. Basically they are simply hostile to criticism. (Unfortunately, almost all proponents of the book do not understand its origins in Panbabylonism and German-Austrian diffusionism. They want to believe it's a wholly original work.) To some extent it almost seems that with his claimed



'rebuttal' to this critique he is protesting against his own lack of effective research into Hamlet's Mill. Mathisen deemed "it was worthwhile to respond to the challenge to the thesis." However, his so-called "response" was not worthwhile - simply a "lame duck." Nowhere does Mathisen demonstrate that he can come to grips with the material I have accumulated. No key point-by-point rebuttal is attempted - simply a very selective generalised discussion. Mathisen is obviously not a maven of issues of ancient history. Rebutting and responding are 2 separate issues. Mathisen's "lame duck" response does not come anywhere near qualifying as a rebuttal of my critique. There is nothing scholarly in its contents. Mathisen sets out his method as: "... I believe it is much more important to examine the person's analysis itself and make a judgment that way." Just because Mathisen apparently believes it doesn't mean that it is relevant or important. Mathisen never explains why he believes this to be important. But it does enable him to avoid dealing with core issues. Why Mathisen's self-declared rebuttal is focused solely on my critique is not explained. Incredibly, none of the numerous critical book reviews are mentioned or their contents rebutted. Mathisen does not explain why he has avoided them within his so-called rebuttal. It is indicated that he cannot rebut them. It is obvious that Mathisen chooses to create and remain on safe ground throughout his self-declared rebuttal. Mathisen avoids dealing in any factual way with the contents (arguments) of Hamlet's Mill. It serves to limit the scope of reply. Why Mathisen chooses a wide title "Has Hamlet's Mill Been "Debunked"? (posted at The Mathisen Corollary, Friday, January 20, 2012) and then simply restricts himself to my developing essay as progressed in 2012, with a claim "examine the person's analysis itself and make a judgment that way," appears to be "click bait."
Interestingly, according to Mathisen my essay is a challenge. Actually it is a complete demolition of Hamlet's Mill and the challenge is with devotees to substantiate their support of the book. If supporters of the book have done any real work as claimed then let them offer their proofs. Mathisen does not state why he considered himself a person suitable to (attempt to) provide answers to my critique. Perhaps being a devotee of the book is sufficient. But Mathisen simply does not provide answers to my critique.
Interestingly, Mathisen (who views himself as a good analyst of material) tends to stamp his authority by describing himself as an author (but has lately started to call himself an historian). I would consider him an audacious autodidact. Mathisen is confident he has things correctly worked out (whereas lots of other people have misinterpreted the evidence). For many people opinions - specifically their opinions, however gained - are stronger than actual evidence (and indeed make evidence redundant). In his 'blogspot' dated Friday, January 20, 2012 he talks about his success at correctly understanding the issues and my 'failure' to do so. As example, Mathisen assures that the Erra Epic does really contain an account of precession as claimed in Hamlet's Mill. It is a classic case of claim by a non-expert without any evidence being offered - a subjective opinion only; the same as the nature of the claim by the authors of Hamlet's Mill! (The entire basis/framework of Hamlet's Mill is subjective opinion.) No need for assyriologists and cuneiform philologists! Mathisen does absolutely nothing to establish his credentials as a reliable expert voice. He does not cite any experts in the field who support his claims and he does not cite any experts in the field who support his claim to expertise. He simply makes a claim. Using the 'vacuum cleaner' technique he combines disparate ideas - Hamlet's Mill ideas with the Hydroplate Theory of creationist Walter Brown (who has a PhD in Mechanical Engineering). J. Hicks has made the point (Amazon Customer Reviews) that this type of theory has been previously promoted by (amateur historians) Alan Alford and Ian Wilson. The paperback edition is published in the USA by Beowulf Books. Googling the company profile for the USA reveals Beowulf Publishing Group, Inc. has an annual revenue of $140,000 and employs a staff of approximately 2. David Mathisen has also conducted a pseudo-review/assessment of this web page. (He obviously does not want Hamlet's Mill devotees to read this critique.) His personal and biased reading leads to specious remarks and insubstantial comments. His reply (certainly not rebuttal) to my critique comprises selective misrepresentations of my critique. It's a manipulative piece of writing. Like many pseudo-historians he attempts to dictate the terms of evidence and set an expectation that if critics don't produce a short 'killer argument' (that is to his satisfaction) then there is no suitable case to be made. Also, strangely, he does not identify or deal with the critical book reviews mentioned.
Amusingly he writes (his 'blogspot' dated Friday, January 20, 2011): "It is somewhat ironic that Gary David Thompson accuses the authors (he is especially critical of von Dechend) of being disorganized, saying: "The contents of the book are poorly organised and presented. The book contains an immense amount of loosely related information but there is no persuasive evidence presented for the connections being made." Ironic because Mr. Thompson's essay can also be accurately described as containing an "immense amount of loosely related information." The first 2/3 of his essay reads like a disjointed recitation of everything that came out of a very vigorous web search, with no explanation as to the significance of the information, how it is connected, or why Mr. Thompson included it at all (or why the reader would be interested in learning it). [Interestingly, Mathisen and drrayeye (Raymond Briggs) are the sole complainers for the early form of the essay. They are both supporters of Hamlet's Mill. Other people praised the essay and assisted with further information. (The early form of the essay can be accessed by using the WayBackMachine at archive.org)] I am not sure why the room number of lectures from the 1960s or the times that seminars met is important to his argument at all, nor why I should want to know which airport Dr. de Santillana flew out of on a trip to Europe. [Mathisen never contacted me to attempt to verify my method of access to sources. He is not correct. That said, obviously Mathisen fails to understand just how much information is available on the internet and apparently rejects it as a research source. Mathisen obviously decided to 'cherry pick' these details in order to create a distortion of what details the essay contains. The essay was not written with Mathisen's personal perceptions in mind. They are irrelevant to my critique. Mathisen is not some established authority/expert that must be taken into consideration. Also, let me make the point that identifying the context in which Hamlet's Mill came to be written and published is important to understanding the material in the book. Overlooked, or ignored, by Mathisen is the introduction of irrelevant details in Hamlet's Mill. As example: In the "Epilogue: The Lost Treasure II" by Giorgio de Santillana there is included a discussion of Tolstoy, and Gandhi. There is nothing that connects them to claims for precessional mythology in antiquity. Apparently it is okay with Mathisen for the authors of Hamlet's Mill to include information/discussion that is irrelevant to their theme.] In fact, the first part of Mr. Thompson's criticism of the authors of Hamlet's Mill recalls the ad campaign describing an imaginary syndrome called "search overload," in which jumbles of information without any context would be recited by a character in a trance-like state, to humorous effect (... -- the first half of the article suffers from the same problem). [The introduction of the word 'important' by Mathisen suggests that any essay critiquing Hamlet's Mill must not contain mundane information - only what can be regarded by Mathisen as 'important.' But Mathisen does not explain what 'important' means.] I can only believe that Mr. Thompson included all of that very detailed information about the personalities and lives of de Santillana and von Dechend as a giant ad hominem attack that is supposed to discredit them and dissuade anyone from reading their work. [Once Mathisen has introduced his belief - which he does not prove - that my critique can only be an ad hominem attack he then readily accepts his uncritical belief. Apparently he then believes there is no need to actually identify any of the numerous facts presented and deal with those. The implication is that my arguments are weakly supported or insufficiently substantiated, and even more, they are badly wrong in such a way that they are tricky or deceptive. I can only conclude that Mathisen can't deal with the critical material I present. The specious claim that I want to "dissuade anyone from reading their work" is not a tactic original to Mathisen but is used by other pseudo-historians such as Graham Hancock.] I do not believe that is a good way to determine whether or not someone's analysis has merit -- I believe it is much more important to examine the person's analysis itself and make a judgment that way. [Incredibly, Mathisen states he does not believe that the merit of an analysis is whether it has clout! Nowhere does Mathisen identify that my "essay" at the time was actually book-length. By avoiding identification of the length of my "essay" it is easy for people who have not seen it to simply believe it comprised perhaps only 2000-3000 words. Currently (January 2017) it comprises a large book.] I believe it is quite unfair to attack the author, as if there are any human authors about whom you cannot find plenty to criticize. ... Of course I do not agree with every sentiment espoused by de Santillana and von Dechend, nor with every aspect of their own personal belief systems or with everything they did during their lifetimes. [Points of disagreement are not stated! Obviously these would give support to my critique! But Mathisen wants to identify my essay as an attack on the authors.] But to mock them for things they did or believed during the decades that they lived (which were very different times in the world of academia than those of today or of the past couple decades) is both uncharitable and



unhelpful." Of course I have not mocked the authors of Hamlet's Mill. This is another invention on the part of Mathisen. But things are not so simple as Mattisen would believe. Mathisen is determined to categorise my critique as an attack upon the authors. Also, his remarks are quite irrelevant. Attempting the claim that I am involved in an 'abusive' type of ad hominem argument in order to discredit the claims of the authors is simply contrived (a fantasy). My critique of Hamlet's Mill is not based upon the personal characteristics of the authors. The personal characteristics of the authors is noted as part of the development of dated argumentation employed in Hamlet's Mill. I make no attempt to unfairly discredit the authors (and nobody has shown that I have). Mathisen's introduction of the term 'mock' is ridiculous. Deemed ad hominem analysis is legitimate when a character critique is directly or indirectly related to the point being articulated. It has importance when evaluating the validity of statements people make to us about others. Good or fair uses of deemed ad hominem analysis are part of a persuasive argument. The deemed ad hominem analysis can help us evaluate what the authors are asserting, why they are offering their particular view, and whether their view is defensible. (See: Media Argumentation: Dialectic, Persuasion, and Rhetoric by the academic philosopher Douglas Walton (2007). See also publications on so-called logical fallacies by the Dutch philosopher of science Maarten Boudry; most recently "The Fallacy Fork." (Skeptical Inquirer, Volume 41, Number 5, September/October, 2017, Pages 46-51). See also his co-authored article, "The fake, the flimsy, and the fallacious." (Argumentation, Volume 29, Number 4, 2015, Pages 431-456).) Simply, if proponents wish to argue for the value of the book due to the credibility of its authors then the credibility of the authors is up for examination. In any case, we can not ignore the academic (professional) and social backgrounds of the authors. My comments on their respective character are not deductive; they are demonstrable in that they are sourced from published records and close friends of the authors. My statements can not be readily dismissed on argumentum ad hominem grounds. Indeed my statements within this critique can not be termed 'fallacious' at all. It appears that for Mathisen smug and misleading observations about biographical content avoids the further need to deal with the actual rebuttal of my criticisms. Rather than deal with the substance of my critique Mathisen carelessly attempts to introduce a label and cry 'fallacy.' Given the chance to deal with facts, Mathisen declines and instead chooses to "pick around the periphery." Also, the 'technique' (= sleight of hand) of Mathisen, "... I believe it is much more important to examine the person's analysis itself and make a judgment that way." simply biases his approach. If I am unfavourable to Hamlet's Mill then I am not open-minded or I am not showing balanced judgment. All this takes us no nearer to whether Mathisen can deal directly with the arguments - it simply lets him ignore such. Mathisen has demonstrated that he is unable to engage in a direct rebuttal of any of the facts I have raised. Perhaps somebody else can step up and offer some serious comment. Mathisen should have correctly commented that my essay contains a large amount of difficult to find biographical and other information. (Currently (2015- and 2017-) being utilised by several PhD students.) Apparently Mathisen is unconcerned whether this is lost - but he has no legitimate voice in setting the benchmark. Other people are concerned that the information should not be lost.
To my knowledge only supporters of Hamlet's Mill - and then only a few - have labelled this investigative essay an ad hominem attack. (This labelling suggests the content of the essay can be ignored.) No doubt these are expressions of dread and annoyance. Those persons who have emotionally and intellectually invested in the claims made in Hamlet's Mill do not take kindly to a wide-ranging investigation of their 'pet' beliefs deriving from the book. The simple reason is the content of this essay both fills in blank areas of the book's development and presents 'demolition arguments.' Since 2004, when it first appeared, the contents of this essay now ranges wider than the title implies. This should be obvious. No informed reply to the contents of this essay have yet been attempted. So what if some background information given is not deemed relevant to the title of the essay. It is relevant to understanding both authors of Hamlet's Mill. The failure to take into account the beliefs and intentions of the authors cripples any assessment of how the book was actually cobbled together (i.e., constructed). No one has really previously bothered to understand and explore this most fruitful path of inquiry.
I am unsurprised that promoters of highly unlikely ideas like to adopt the classic unsophisticated approach to logical fallacies. I find this tiring. Such an approach is hollow in practice and without the force they seem to think it has. Why people in general are accepting of this approach from alternative history promoters as apparently conclusive demolition worries me greatly. People need to get a realistic knowledge of so-called logical fallacies and their force. A reasonable starting point is Plausible Argument in Everyday Conversation by Douglas Walton (1992). One-Sided Arguments: A Dialectical Analysis of Bias (also) by Douglas Walton (1999) should not be excluded. Also, for the ultimate cure for hero-worship I suggest Hamlet's Mill devotees read Intellectuals by Paul Johnson (1988, Reprinted 1993). His focus is primarily personal. He examines the personal lives of a number of outstanding intellectuals and shreds their public aura. (Paul Johnson (1928- ) is an English journalist, historian, speechwriter and author.)
On Page 1 of my website I carefully have explained for a decade that all my posted essays can be considered drafts. This present book length essay is a work in progress. I also wrote on Page 1 that "Criticisms are given in the spirit of honest inquiry." Also, On Page 1 of my website I clearly state: "The posted essays are draft form only and will be subject to revision as time permits. Several comprise little more than a rough draft and the "roughest" are flagged as being "under construction." (Revisions or additions to essays are incorporated without extensive rewriting.)" Now that I am finally semi-retired (beginning November, 2012) I have recently taken the time to initially reorganise aspects of my web site, including this critique. See below for a repeat of this point. Why vigorous web searching is an issue with Mathisen is unclear. The internet simply expands the possibilities for accessing information. Quite simply, the internet has made it possible for people to acquire a vast amount of previously unobtainable academic material. The generous sharing of information by academic institutions and journal repositories/depositories, and academics has enabled levels of research that were unachievable a few decades ago. Perhaps Mathisen believes the marvellous convenience of the web for uncovering and assembling details should not be used in legitimate research! I have certainly not used it exclusively. Having spent 10-20 hours per week for some 20 years, systematically working library shelves to uncover material I will opt for the convenience of the web. The web is a useful research tool that can replace the need to attend major libraries. I am hesitant to drive some 1800 kilometres for a line or two of information when it can be quickly obtained off the web. This seems sensible to me. It saves both time and money. The information is the same - it does not have a lesser value. With Google, sources can be easily traced, and time more effectively used. Also, other web sites enable articles to be conveniently download. The end results are the same regarding the information obtained. Also, difficult to obtain material - previously unknown becomes accessible via use of the internet.
My posting to Hastro-L (23-9-2013) in response to the use of the ad hominem claim: "The essay is headed "Critics and Criticisms of Hamlet’s Mill." That should sufficiently identify its intended purpose. The essay is a point of view resulting from an investigation. It has details that most people would not know – but perhaps should know in order to properly understand the book. (The accusation that I want to stop people from reading the book is absurd.) The Hamlet's Mill essay is intended to be read as a whole – not cherry picked. It should be obvious I intend to recover: (1) the character and ideology of the persons; (2) the history of the ideas; and (3) the problems with the idea. It is interesting to see how some people are setting out how I should conduct and disclose research. It is a personal website aimed at helping to dispel erroneous history of astronomy claims. Apparently though, some people believe it is considered ethically okay to propagate an erroneous idea and withhold from examining it to the core. Why do I include point (1) the character and ideology of the persons? One reason is personal interest. Personal interest directs what I write about. No other justification is required on my part. Another reason is because proponents of the book will portray an ideal picture of the authors as 'super academics,' as a way of confirming the reliability of the book. That simply invites investigation. I am trying to know the authors without making assumptions. People will well appreciate that expertise and credibility earned in one academic profession does not mean automatic credibility in subjects outside that profession. In the context of Hamlet's Mill I do not find that either author demonstrates 'super academic' status. Those who accuse me of engaging in ad hominem need to explore what the term is about. As a reasonable summary discussion: http://plover.net/~bonds/adhominem.html "One of the most widely misused terms on the Net is "ad hominem". It is most often introduced into a discussion by certain delicate types, delicate of personality and mind, whenever their opponents resort to a bit of sarcasm. As



soon as the suspicion of an insult appears, they summon the angels of ad hominem to smite down their foes, before ascending to argument heaven in a blaze of sanctimonious glory. They may not have much up top, but by God, they don't need it when they've got ad hominem on their side. It's the secret weapon that delivers them from any argument unscathed. In reality, ad hominem is unrelated to sarcasm or personal abuse. Argumentum ad hominem is the logical fallacy of attempting to undermine a speaker's argument by attacking the speaker instead of addressing the argument. The mere presence of a personal attack does not indicate ad hominem: the attack must be used for the purpose of undermining the argument, or otherwise the logical fallacy isn't there. It is not a logical fallacy to attack someone; the fallacy comes from assuming that a personal attack is also necessarily an attack on that person's arguments. Therefore, if you can't demonstrate that your opponent is trying to counter your argument by attacking you, you can't demonstrate that he is resorting to ad hominem. If your opponent's sarcasm is not an attempt to counter your argument, but merely an attempt to insult you (or amuse the bystanders), then it is not part of an ad hominem argument. Actual instances of argumentum ad hominem are relatively rare. Ironically, the fallacy is most often committed by those who accuse their opponents of ad hominem, since they try to dismiss the opposition not by engaging with their arguments, but by claiming that they resort to personal attacks. Those who are quick to squeal "ad hominem" are often guilty of several other logical fallacies, including one of the worst of all: the fallacious belief that introducing an impressive-sounding Latin term somehow gives one the decisive edge in an argument." I have not aimed at the authors. The core of my critique is squarely focused on (2) the history of the ideas; and (3) the problems with the idea. Lastly, for those who wish to claim some moral high ground .... The tone of the essay reflects the standard of Hastro-L and off-line e-mails addressed to me by some list members (one in particular persisting for years, and ranging from abuse to threats). Some list members need to consider 'cleaning their own house' of double standards."
Nowhere does Mathisen demolish my assessment of the expertise and personal character of de Santillana and von Dechend.
Nowhere does Mathisen recognise that Hamlet's Mill is a reworking of Panbabylonism. He is also obviously uneasy regarding any detailed background information on de Santillana and von Dechend being assembled. An example of his distortions and sleight of hand is illuminating. In a demonstration of over-confidence he manufactures a case. In his 'blogspot' dated Friday, January 20, 2012, Mathisen includes this comment in his pseudo-review/assessment of this web page: "He brings up a book by William Thompson which interprets the fairy tale of Rapunzel as "involving the sun and moon and the planetary motion of Mercury, Venus and Mars." This interpretation is not dealt with directly (in other words, no argument is offered to demonstrate that Rapunzel is not about celestial bodies) but rather is "discredited" by saying that William Thompson knew Hertha von Dechend and that she "discussed her ideas on ancient mythology and astronomy with him at their lunches in the student cafeteria." This does not discredit the thesis of Hamlet's Mill at all either! [But Mathisen once again is confused. I am very obviously not trying to use such mundane information to discredit Hamlet's Mill.] In fact, the possibility that Rapunzel contains such information is further validation of their thesis (Hamlet's Mill cites several cases in which folk tales appear to contain the same celestial information as epics and sagas contain, but using more "rustic" characters such as the farmer's cat instead of great heroes or warriors). I have compared this to actors who appear in very different costumes in different movies or plays, but who are the same actors." Ignored by Mathisen is the fact that the onus is on William Thompson to convincingly prove his case. (A reasonable "rule of thumb" is the judgement that the burden of proof lies with the proponent of the claim being asserted.) Thompson does not prove his case. He makes it obvious that he is involved in speculation. For example he frequently writes such sentences as: "If Rapunzel is Venus, Frau Gothel the Moon, and the Prince Mars, then one suspects that the mother must be Mother Earth .... If my interpretation of the tale is valid. (Imaginary Landscape, Page 37.)" I mention William Thompson in a number of contexts. This is completely ignored by Mathisen. In relation to Mathisen's distortive quote my larger argument is (also see above): "Astronomical interpretations of mythology (often incorporating precession as the "key") have been extensively promoted in numerous books published between circa 1880 and 1930. Historically, proponents of a scheme of astronomical mythology (nearly always based on an equally divided 12-constellation zodiac) have ceaselessly demonstrated that it is possible to incorporate a diverse and differing range of astronomical data into their interpretations. Almost all the authors interpret the same mythology or epics with different astronomical data i.e., identify different astronomical phenomenon. Simply, an "astro-mythic" scheme can bear several interpretations. (It is also interesting to see the apparently Jungian "astro-mythic" slant given to Hebrew mythology by Tom Chetwynd in his The Age of Myth (1991).) Such multitude of divergence indicates that the methodology is flawed or that the interpretations are forced. In a nutshell: The problem is no "astronomical key" has been identified - as is evidenced by the diverse astronomical methods of interpretation. This facilitates the criticism that often the method(s) of "astro-mythic" interpretation is perhaps not a method after all. A reasonable analogy would perhaps be the elaborate "Bacon is Shakespeare" ciphers that have been "discovered". What stands out is the fact that the coding systems and underlying identification messages are never the same. The 2 volumes by Ignatius Donnelly titled The Great Cryptogram (1888) are a prime example. John Nicolson's book No Ciphers in Shakespeare (1888) showed that the cipher scheme "discovered" by Ignatius Donnelly can be used to produce any required result. Likewise, elements within a single scheme of astronomical mythology can produce several variant interpretations. The problem is illustrated by two "recent" publications using the same tale in the context of Hamlet's Mill (1969). They are Heavens Unearthed in Nursery Rhymes and Fairy Tales by Matt Kane (1999) and Imaginary Landscapes: Making Worlds of Myth and Science by William Thompson (1989). Both authors refer to Hamlet's Mill: An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time. In "Chapter 5: Rumpelstiltskin" of Kane's book he interprets the tale as a lunar myth. In "Chapter 1: Rapunzel: Cosmology Lost" of Thompson's book he interprets the tale as involving the sun and moon and the planetary motion of Mercury, Venus and Mars. (William Thompson was a colleague of Hertha von Dechend when she was at MIT. Both were in the Department of Humanities. He was at MIT from 1965 to 1968; Associate Professor of Humanities (i.e., Associate Professor of Literature) from 1966. At his current website (2010) he states that Hertha von Dechend discussed her ideas on ancient mythology and astronomy with him at their lunches in the student cafeteria. The version by John Ebert in his book Twilight of the Clockwork God 1999) is distortive.)
A successful theory is such because it can best fit all the known facts. Also, within each of the sciences a single controlling theory tends to dominate. Two opposing theories which can use similar starting points but arrive at different explanative outcomes to fit the facts need to be given further investigation before one is accepted (with or without modification) or neither is accepted. It is also really up to the proponents of an idea to reasonably establish their case - including answering all reasonable criticisms raised. The content of the speculations of the above-mentioned authors, however, apart from the premises which enable them, are essentially in conflict. Relative harmony would be a better indicator of the reliability of the "astro-mythic" method. What perhaps would also be more credible is an astronomical interpretation that did not incorporate a scheme of ancient zodiacal constellations to prop the "precession in mythology" approach. The nature of the claims for precessional mythology (invariably based on a conjectured ancient 12-constellation zodiac of 12 equal divisions) require that any difficult facts arising from such need to be critically discussed and myopic approaches avoided. We need to separate conviction from science and to ensure we satisfactorily do such we should not disable our skepticism.
According to Bill Lauritzen (The Invention of God: The Origins of Religious and Scientific Thought, 2007), much of Hamlet's Mill can be interpreted as describing volcanic and geological processes." So much for Mathisen's investigative accuracy! I remain curious whether this example of shoddiness typifies his book. It is also doubtful whether he has read Imaginary Landscape. I think not. Mathisen has failed to identify that until 28/1/2012 I spelled 'Imaginary' in the title erroneously as 'Imaginery.' The relevant part of Mathisen's reply posted to Graeme Hancock's 'Message Boards' on 29/1/2012. Once again, his distortions and sleight of hand is interesting.: "Interesting that he doesn't seem to really confront my arguments but after quoting my discussion immediately returns to attacks on the arguments of William Thompson, Tom Chetwynd, etc. I don't really see any substantive discussion of any of the points I raised about his main criticism of the argument in Hamlet's Mill but I believe that if he or anyone else reads my book I present quite a lot of evidence. I will leave it up to readers of his article to determine if he is being ad hominem in his arguments against Hertha von Dechend and Giorgio de Santillana or not, but I would say that his description of me as a "another amateur 'tub



thumping' historian promoting their [sic -- this is a grammatical error on Thompson's part] brand of pseudo-history" certainly feels a little "ad hominem" to me. What Mathisen apparently fails to understand - or perhaps simply chooses to ignore - is the very obvious fact that my critique includes the attempt to recover all information known about de Santillana and von Dechend. It appears that if Mathisen is not interested in such then nobody else should be! Even supporters of Hamlet's Mill, such as Walter Cruttenden and Phil Norfleet, take critical biographical information I have uncovered and use it (without credit to me). (Walter Cruttenden is quite happy to refer to de Santillana as being somewhat mystical.) His conclusion that "I remain curious whether this example of shoddiness typifies his book" also throws around fairly loaded terms -- the example of "shoddiness" he cites appears to be the fact that I do not specifically mention a book by Bill Lauritzen published in 2007 entitled The Invention of God: The Origins of Religious and Scientific Thought." This type/style of defensive posturing is a clear indication of lack of substance and ability to deal with specific critical comment. Though I make it clear that my limited comments are restricted to an example, Mathisen ignores this. However, he reinforces my case in the context of his further comments. Once again his personal and biased reading leads to specious remarks and insubstantial comments. It is interesting that Mathisen sets out that when he criticises he is discussing but when I point out correctives or criticise I am attacking. Regarding the supposed grammatical error. A wider command of English would have identified that I am following the increasingly common use of 'their,' even though not accepted by strict grammarians. Throughout my website I also use the increasingly common BCE, even though B.C. is insisted upon by strict grammarians. Perhaps in more formal essays. Another lesson in modern style. To exclude all occurrences of 'he/she,' the use of the generic 'they' in its place is usual. Sometimes this leads to slightly awkward phrasing, but not enough to warrant the use of 'he/she.'
Recent (24-8-2015), Note 1: In another attempt at 'slice and dice' of my Hamlet’s Mill critique, David Mathisen January 29, 2012 (http://grahamhancock.com/phorum/read.php?8,993249,993885) writes: "As I stated previously, it is pretty clear that the argument can be made that the 12 tribes of Israel described in detail in the Hebrew Scripture have zodiacal connections, and that their arrangement when encamping describes a "square zodiac" (this analysis has been put forward by Martin Doutre (sic) with extensive supporting evidence). This alone indicates that the 12-house zodiac [?] has been known since long before 1000 BC, but it is not the only such evidence." Unfortunately no evidence is given or even hinted at with this posting. Martin Doutré argued in his 1999 self-published book Ancient Celtic New Zealand that New Zealand had a prePolynesian Celtic population, and that boulders with petroglyphs on a hill in Silverdale in Auckland are artifacts left by those people. The Celts were supposedly in New Zealand several thousand years before the Polynesians arrived. Historians and archaeologists dismiss the claims. Michael King wrote in his history of New Zealand (The Penguin History of New Zealand (1994)): "Despite a plethora of amateur theories about Melanesian, South American, Egyptian, Phoenician and Celtic colonisation of New Zealand, there is not a shred of evidence that the first human settlers were anything other than Polynesian." Richard Hill, professor of New Zealand Studies at Victoria University of Wellington, said in 2012: "Not one of [the theories] has ever passed any remote academic scrutiny." Hugh Laracy of the University of Auckland called them: "wild speculation" that has been "thoroughly disposed of by academic specialists." Another historian, Vincent O'Malley, and the New Zealand Archaeological Association regard the theories as having a racist or at least a political element, seeking to cast doubt on Waitangi Tribunal claims. Scott Hamilton in "No to Nazi Pseudo-history: an Open Letter" further explains objections to the theories of Bolton and Doutré (and the website Ancient Celtic New Zealand). Martin Doutré, an American (born 1946, Altadena, California) and self-proclaimed astro-archaeologist, who has no academic training in either astronomy or archaeology, also sets out various claims regarding the Great Pyramid and the claimed network of pyramids and other megalithic sites around the world. Martin Doutré's claims have been linked with extreme right-wing politics. From a review by David Mathisen posted at Amazon.com of Ancient Celtic New Zealand by Martin Doutré (http://mathisencorollary.blogspot.com.au/2011/04/review-of-martin-doutres-ancient-celtic.html): "Martin Doutré's Ancient Celtic New Zealand is a very important examination of the evidence for an advanced ancient civilization that understood phi, pi, the size and shape of the earth, the intricate details of the celestial phenomena caused by earth's orbit and the axial rotation that leads to precession, and that could navigate the seas, mine for greenstone and copper, and construct precision monuments such as the pyramids of Giza and Stonehenge at a date in history that conventional theory says is impossible. His first-hand work and insights provide a valuable new perspective that is different from alternative thinkers who have gone before him. The presence of extensive evidence from sites in the Americas, in lesser-known sites in Europe, and of course in New Zealand are added to the work that others have written about, and serve to help add credence to others who also perceive major gaps and flaws in the conventional framework bitterly defended by those currently controlling "academia." Mr. Doutre's (sic) work breaks important new ground in the use of phi reductions, the analysis of recurring geometric patterns found in art around the globe, and theories concerning who these ancients were and where they traveled. I have written a book which examines these issues using additional evidence from geology and mythology, and Mr. Doutré's theory was absolutely foundational to my own analysis (The Mathisen Corollary). I wholeheartedly recommend Mr. Doutré's book and his website (also called Ancient Celtic New Zealand). ..." Wow .... what a lot of imaginative nonsense!
Recent (24-8-2015), Note 2: "This book demonstrates that the ancient wisdom encoded in the myths of the human race contain a treasure of esoteric knowledge directly related to the question of who we are and why we are here, and that this knowledge is directly related to the discoveries of modern quantum physics, as well as the mysteries of out-of-body travel, near-death experiences, and the astonishing fact that the predecessors of even the earliest-known human civilizations appear to have possessed detailed working knowledge of earth energies, and to have built a world-wide grid system whose purpose we can only guess at today. Further, there is clear evidence that this ancient wisdom has been deliberately targeted for eradication by forces who took over the Roman Empire from within, and who used the might of that empire to impose a literalist interpretation of scriptures upon "the west" in order to hide their true meaning, and to launch attacks to crush that knowledge around the world: a hideous campaign which continues right up to the present day." (Extract from inside flap of hardcover edition of: The Undying Stars: The Truth That Unites the World's Ancient Wisdom and the Conspiracy to Keep It from You by David Mathisen (2014).) This type of ranting by Mathisen hardly establishes his credibility.
Also, David Mathisen (http://mathisencorollary.blogspot.com.au/2011/04/review-of-martin-doutres-ancient-celtic.html) also states: "I personally believe that all mankind is descended at a very recent date (less than 10,000 years ago, and probably less than 6,000 years ago) from the survivors of a cataclysmic global flood ...." This does not inspire my confidence. Once again, this type of pseudo-scientific/pseudo-historical claim by Mathisen hardly establishes his credibility.
The strange case of drrayeye (Raymond Briggs)
Another supporter of Hamlet's Mill, and also supporter of David Mathisen, and names himself/herself 'drrayeye,' posted to Graeme Hancock's Author of the Month Forum on 9 January, 2012 (http://www.grahamhancock.com/phorum/read.php?f=8&i=22517&t=22365), and also Graeme Hancock's 'Message Boards' on 9/1/2012 On the Graham Hancock Forum, January 9, 2012 drrayeye describes me as a debunker. It was likely not meant as a kindly description. The sense meant was likely a debunker usually has little knowledge outside their narrow perspective, little common sense, and little or no ability to connect the dots. A debunker is more likely a person who attempts to expose or discredit claims believed to be false, exaggerated, or pretentious. I would prefer the descriptor, skeptical investigator of all manner of bogus claims. To continue with drrayeye: "Dave (dwm) took the time to respond in detail to the substance of the "debunking." [Mathisen did no such thing, but this ploy enables 'drrayeye' to also avoid any attempt a legitimate criticism.] I didn't see any need to go further. Without agreeing or disagreeing, I'd have required a complete rewrite before I even edited it. You weren't the first and you probably won't be the last to have concerns. Giving him (and you) the greatest benefit of the doubt, I'd say that you both have concerns/questions about Hamlet's Mill that might be worth exploring further if they were better expressed. In astonomical (sic) terms, that's several light years away from debunking." But this remark is something of a 'trick.' I am writing for my website;



not to drrayeye's demands for his/her perception of standards to be met. However, my original essay was somewhat loosely divided into a biographical first part and a second part comprising the critique. Thought the first part was originally somewhat loosely written the second part was not. It formed a cogent case against Hamlet's Mill. This person 'drrayeye' also seems reluctant to investigate much. Possibly he can't - it is outside of his ability. Better perhaps to find any way to avoid any comment instead of publicly exposing one's lack of knowledge. Amusingly, 'drrayeye' has earlier resorted (Graham Hancock website, 11/10/2007) to an ad hominem attack on myself and demanded from me a standard that is excluded for Graham Hancock! According to 'drrayeye' different standards are applicable. The sheer evasiveness of the posting by 'drrayeye' is a continuing demonstration of the absence of critical/scientific method by believers in alternative history. I identify myself, give part of my educational background. "Drrayeye' does not identify himself/herself and does not give any information about their educational background. Though my material is posted on my website, and this is how 'drrayeye' accessed it, 'drrayeye' sets out that my arguments need not be dealt with unless they are published in a peer-reviewed journal. This means that 'drrayeye' should stop posting arguments and comment unless in a peer reviewed journal. But 'drrayeye' seems happy to support Graham Hancock even though Graeme Hancock has no qualifications for the topics he deals with and also has no articles on his alternative history ideas published in a peer reviewed journal. David Mathisen and 'drrayeye' both fail to demonstrate a standard of argument acceptable to a refereed journal. The failure to understand and establish objective standards enables the carnival of ideas to be kept in place. 'Drrayeye' is perhaps representative of the calibre of person who confidently wish to impose a new version of history. 'Drrayeye' is effectively anonymous, and offers no evidence of academic status (academic positions held or academic papers published) or credentials (either under graduate or post graduate, having (hopefully) relevance to the topic he/she chooses to engage in). I at least have demonstrated I can gain a postgraduate degree in applied science, and also a graduate diploma. In his/her facile postings to Graham Hancock's website 'drrayeye' has avoided demonstrating his/her capability for credible, reasoned argument and critique. Perhaps the trivial is the best that can be done. That is usually the problem with supporters of precession Hamlet's Mill style.
On Page 1 of my website I clearly state: "The posted essays are draft form only and will be subject to revision as time permits. Several comprise little more than a rough draft and the "roughest" are flagged as being "under construction." (Revisions or additions to essays are incorporated without extensive rewriting.)" This Hamlet's Mill devotee has a very closed mindset. Not only are David Mathisen and 'drrayeye' keen to find any reason to ignore/dismiss the only detailed critique of Hamlet's Mill on the web but, at the same time, they is quite prepared to struggle with the atrociously written book which fails to provide a coherent argument, and (undeniably) should have been subject to rigorous editing. The strength of their wishful thinking has created immunity against criticisms and an unwillingness to deal with contrary findings of mythologists, philologists, archaeologists, and geologists (unless in an evasive manner). It is increasingly my experience that supporters/advocates of Hamlet's Mill, both amateur and academic, have uncritical acceptance of its themes and hostility towards any critics.
The recovery of details of the de Santillana-von Dechend period at MIT, and their personalities, in order to gain an insightful interpretation is apparently not wanted or appreciated by Mathisen and ilk. However, no one is above critique and no one can survive inspection for perfection. Why and how the authors formed their ideas is important and is discoverable. Unsurprisingly they did not attempt an impartial approach to the topic. These supporters/advocates also fail to realise that nearly half a century on since its publication they have still not met the case made against the book by competent critics. It is simply part of the responsibility of an historian, whether professional or amateur, to publish as much as can be gleaned about the development process for Hamlet's Mill. It seems that for supporters it is about maintaining the mythical status of the authors, viewed as a hero and a heroine. The only apparent purpose of Mathisen's self-proclaimed 'rebuttal' seems to be to give assurance to laypersons unable to understand and/or apply basic principals of critical thinking. Mathisen forgets to include any reason why he is an expert on all the issues he supports. He has not indicated any attempt to independently investigate critical sources quoted to gather a more detailed understanding. Interestingly, there is no real indication that Mathisen has bothered/will bother to do any critical investigation of pro and con issues. I still await a serious 'rebuttal' attempt from David Mathisen. Also, 'drrayeye' need not feel left out. Simply choosing to do nothing more than engage in select irrelevant objections to my critique is a puerile exercise.
Note 1: The dismissive 2012 comments by 'drrayeye' simply copy his 2007 style dealing with criticisms of his 'heroes.' On 11-10-2007 (Graham Hancock's Mystery Forum, http://www.grahamhancock.com/phorum/read.php?f=1&i=229459&t=229206) 'drrayeye' writes (in response to 'Merrell'): "As you can see above, your critique of the evidence supporting Bauval depends almost entirely on the impressions of Gary Thompson. Here are the credentials he cited in the website above: Quote: "I originally studied electrical engineering at the Gordon Institute of Technology but didn't like it that much. During 1970/71 I served as a combat soldier in South Vietnam and also didn't like it that much. During the 1970's I twice travelled around the world visiting some 70 countries in all. During my first world trip I also worked in England for several years. Circa 1980 I changed careers and started working in occupational health and safety. During the early 1990's I lived in South Australia for several years and taught occupational health and safety at several Technical and Further Education Colleges. My senior degree is in occupational health and safety and I also have tertiary qualifications in computer technology, and workplace training. After 10 long years in occupational health and safety consulting and training at the Victorian Employers' Chamber of Commerce and Industry I joined Ergosh Safety Management Services in
September 2007." Since I have no direct knowledge of precession, I must relie (sic) on experts. I would want to see a peer reviewed article or two, some credentials, and collaborating comments before I used Thompson to establish the credibility of Bauval's evidence support in "Hamlet's Mill" or anything else. We appear to have the blind leading the blind." (It should be quite obvious my personal details and academic qualifications are given in a popular style - I have made no attempt to present a professional curriculum vitae.) Here again we see the same avoidance technique in use. This from a person who has made over 10,000 posts to the Graham Hancock Message Board. This is a lot of of postings for a person who professes not to know much - or bother to take the time to know. At this time Hamlet's Mill was published over 35 years ago. It is easy to conclude that 'drrayeye' (1) likes to persist with uninformed opinion, and (2) is unable to research expert information for himself/herself. Apparently 'drrayeye' requires information to be conveniently presented (and has something against personal research effort). On Graham Hancock's Science Forum on 23-August-2007 (http://www.grahamhancock.com/phorum/read.php?f=3&i=21094&t=20981&v=f) 'drrayeye' in reply to 'AndyBlackard' wrote: "Critical thinkers and philosophers will accuse you of "poisoning the well." One doesn't attack the person, one challenges the evidence or proposes the collection of evidence." Persons such as 'drrayeye' seem to have compiled a 'tool box' of standard responses formulated to deflect critics and ensure that adherents/devotees do not have to engage in any form of critical exchange regarding their justification of the beliefs they support. If Hancock, Mathisen and 'drrayeye' want to conclude/claim to have successfully deciphered/understood the Neolithic/Paleolithic sciences then 'so what.' However, if they want to prove this to others then they must meet the burden of providing suitable standards of proof. Where is a peer reviewed article or two by 'drrayeye', some credentials, and collaborating comments? (Indeed, where is any peer reviewed article by Hancock on his claims to revise history.) Of course I have not formally cited my academic credentials on my website. Why would I? That I have more than 1 or 2 qualifications should be obvious from the context. That the majority of my website consists of annotated references - academic and popular - is ignored by 'drrayeye.' That my critiques are based on current expert opinion - and are not simply my impressions - is something that 'drrayeye' obviously does not want to know. Once again, the Graham Hancock has no formal qualification for the issues he writes about but this is ignored by 'drrayeye.' That non-academic critics may well understand the issues that 'drrayeye' admits he cannot is not even considered. 'Drrayeye' once again shows he will not make any attempt to evaluate claims and evidence. It seems to be all about what he/she likes/chooses to believe. Of course if 'drrayeye' genuinely sought to follow expert opinion then he/she would abandon belief in Hancock's pseudo-historical ideas (and also David Mathisen's. That it's all just a 'word-smithing game' for 'drrayeye' to believe as he/she wants is obvious in his/her comment to "Merrill' (05-10-2007): "Though the evidence may not meet your requirements, it satisfies most of us." This simply demonstrates there are people like 'drrayeye' who find an anti-mainstream perspective attractive. Also, 'drrayeye' is simply 'keeping ground.'



Also, the background and qualifications of David Mathisen is overlooked by 'drrayeye.' David Mathisen states in third person, in part (http://dwmbio.blogspot.com.au/): "He had the opportunity to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he encountered a rigorous curriculum of engineering, mathematics, science, literature, boxing, wrestling, gymnastics, and military history. The Academy library was home to floor after floor of arcane books, many of them from the nineteenth century. Most free time was absorbed skydiving for the cadet parachute team, and summers were filled with military training at the Army's Airborne School, Air Assault School, Light Leader Course, and with the 7th Infantry Division, as well as with more skydiving around the country, in Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona. After graduation, Mathisen became an Infantry officer in the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment in the 82nd Airborne Division. He graduated from Ranger School and the Jumpmaster Course, and later commanded a company of the 4th Infantry Division in Fort Hood, Texas. Following command, he attended Texas A&M University to study for a Master's degree in English literature, enroute to a job teaching in the English Department back at West Point." Perhaps 'drrayeye' should critique David Mathisen's background. Nothing here to give confidence that Mathisen is an expert on all the issues he supports. Indeed, Mathisen makes it clear that most of his time was spent in pursuits that were irrelevant to gaining a specialised understanding of history, mythology, etc. It can be said that Mathisen appeared to avoid gaining any specialised formal knowledge of the subjects he now claims expert knowledge of.
In failing to set out any logical/rational arguments both David Mathisen and 'drrayeye' are engaging in nothing more than merely setting out their beliefs. Avoided is the fact that it is up to Hancock, Mathisen, and 'drrayeye' (and others of this ilk) to prove their respective claims. A reasonable "rule of thumb" is the judgement that the burden of proof lies with the proponent of the claim being asserted.
Recently, after 2 Moderator warnings for 'Flooding' (= posting the Global Village Message Board (a Graham Hancock website) with large sections of cut and paste text instead of simply quoting the website URL, 'drrayeye' had his/her account suspended from 6-May-2013 to 13-May-2013. (See: http://www.grahamhancock.com/phorum/read.php?f=2&i=278912&t=278638) In his/her eagerness to post and express their view it would be interesting to know if 'drrayeye' at all times met academic standards with everything acceptable for publication in peer-reviewed journals.
Note 2: The 2007 Graham Hancock's Science Forum on 23-August-2007 (http://www.grahamhancock.com/phorum/read.php? f=3&i=21094&t=20981&v=f) website page is interesting in that in multiple postings 'drrayeye' sets out his anti-evolutionary views, distrust of mainstream science, attendance at Cornell University, religious views, identification of himself as a scientist, and "someone who designs studies." He even reproduces an article of his with his name Raymond P. Briggs. This is sufficient to identify 'drrayeye' as Raymond P. Briggs, Ph.D, Cornell University, research methodologist, currently working as an associate with ARBDC Consultants (ARBDC Group Dissertation Consulting Services). 'Drrayeye' appears to be Raymond Briggs (drrayeye@earthlink.net) who is connected with the Oneonta Congregational Church (see: http://oneonta.wordpress.com/). Also, http://www.grahamhancock.com/phorum/profile.php?f=8&id=12106 clearly identifies 'drrayeye' as Ray Briggs and identifies he has made over 10,000 posts to the Graham Hancock Message Board. Raymond P. Briggs Ph.D, Exp. Psychology Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. (http://www.caluniversity.edu/the-university/faculty/#Raymond) is a faculty member of CalUniversity. CalUniversity is a distance education institution of higher learning dedicated to the study of Business Administration and Management. From multiple 2007 postings on Graham Hancock's Science Forum (http://www.grahamhancock.com/phorum/read.php?f=3&i=21094&t=20981&v=f): "... It would be difficult to find a modern academic biologist who didn't "believe" in evolution. However, that "belief" has been subject to scientific proof to such an extent, that nearly every evolutionist may have already parted company with Darwin's original ideas within his/her own specialty area. And their "beliefs" could change by the hour, minute, or day. ... In my opinion, the confusion here is mixing faith and science. Faith is something we believe to be true. It does not have to be proven. Scientific theories are known to be false--or at least falsifiable. They lead to paradigm developments and revolutions in thinking. One can have deep religious faith in God's creation and at the same time accept the most recent version of evolution as the basis for scientific study." .... "I've never been too comfortable with evolution--not for religious, but scientific reasons. It almost seemed simple minded--but biology is not my field. I agree with you that the creationists and intelligent design critics of evolution are often made scapegoats. These days, the scientific attacks on evolution are not coming only from Christians; they are coming from many alternative ways to think." .... " ... I believe that ID represents the first tangible evidence of the deep dissatisfaction with evolution from within the field. Evolutionary theory is getting old faster than I ever expected." .... "Most of the discrediting of evolution comes from within--not from intelligent design. Intelligent design isn't part of game among card carrying investigators, but simply a sign of decay within evolution. Religion has nothing to do with it." "... my own guess of what emerges if the evolution explanation collapses, is some sort of "system" theory that will be similar to software based information systems." [Note: More exactly, faith is belief in something regardless of the evidence. It is the deliberate suspension of critical thinking. Faith is wholly resistant to reason or confrontation with actual facts. "The difference between faith and insanity is that faith is the ability to hold firmly to a conclusion that is incompatible with the evidence, whereas insanity is the ability to hold firmly to a conclusion that is incompatible with the evidence." - William Harwood.]
Summary comments on Mattisen and Briggs.
Mathisen and Briggs hold that I have unfairly characterised the authors of Hamlet's Mill and its contents in the harshest and most unfavourable manner with the intention of encouraging people (who exactly - laypeople of academics?) to dismiss the book and its authors without reading it. This is simply not so. Take my word for it that I strongly urge people to (attempt to) read the book and judge for themselves whether I am being too harsh. It is obvious that I don't think Hamlet's Mill is a book that should be treated with any respect. Part of the issue is lack of scholarly accuracy and lack of clarity.
A project for David Mathisen and Raymond Briggs: Explain why Hamlet's Mill (1) uses tenuous arguments based on incorrect or outdated linguistic information, (2) lacks use of modern sources, and (3) has an over-reliance on coincidence. Also: Why, in the absence of any credible evidence, the claim of and influential and far-flung ancient civilisation is plausible. If their actions ignoring this set of issues connected with the book it would seem to show their unconcern for working towards the truth of the matter. In his pseudo-"rebuttal", David Mathisen also ignored the expert criticisms by the early book reviewers. I suggest that he demonstrate some legitimacy and deal with their scholarly issues. But perhaps the intent is not to legitimately rebut anything but to keep the appearance that the book has merit. It is interesting when Mathisen informs himself nobody else does - that he has done a good job with his 'rebuttal.'
Hamlet's Mill is influential only in pseudo-historical and pseudo-archaeological circles. Though (originally, in the publisher's blurb) claimed to be a "seminal work" it is not the result of productive research and its material does not lead to productive research. As the pointed out by the archaeologist Rebecca Bradley, it is totally disconnected from any historical and archaeological evidence. (It is the reemployment of the antiquated and rejected method of Friedrich Welcker and Max Müller. Hamlet's Mill is an extension of Max Muller's attempt to formulate a "Science of Mythology.") Supportive articles only give examples of unconnected archaeological evidence combined with speculation i.e., Stonehenge astronomy. Devotees of Hamlet's Mill have never been able to point out 1 single valid discovery to be found within the pages of Hamlet's Mill. This should identify its contents as a phantasma. Also, an exact catalogue of their solid and substantial (proven) contributions has not been forthcoming by any proponent of Hamlet’s Mill. Only dubious additional speculation has appeared. A prime example is Mathisen's statement (discussed above): "... the possibility that Rapunzel contains such [astronomical] information is further validation of their thesis." Confusing possibility with evidence and then asserting this amounts to validation demonstrates clearly that factlessness and speculation does not bother proponents of Hamlet's Mill. To their mind it rates as evidence! To my mind it rates as garbage. Mathisen makes no attempt to demonstrate the



validation of the interpretation. Mathisen's declaration ignores or is unaware that I wrote: "The problem is illustrated by two "recent" publications using the same tale in the context of Hamlet's Mill (1969). They are Heavens Unearthed in Nursery Rhymes and Fairy Tales by Matt Kane (1999) and Imaginary Landscapes: Making Worlds of Myth and Science by William Thompson (1989). Both authors refer to Hamlet's Mill: An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time. In "Chapter 5: Rumpelstiltskin" of Kane's book he interprets the tale as a lunar myth. In "Chapter 1: Rapunzel: Cosmology Lost" of Thompson's book he interprets the tale as involving the sun and moon and the planetary motion of Mercury, Venus and Mars." There is hardly a sense of reliability in interpretation here. The content of the speculations of the above-mentioned authors, however, apart from the premises which enable them, are essentially in conflict. Also not dealt with by Mathisen is my statement: "The earliest known mention of Rumplestiltskin occurs in Johann Fischart's Geschichtklitterung, or Gargantua of 1577 (a loose adaptation of Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel) which refers to an "amusement" for children named "Rumpele stilt or the Poppart"."
From my Intention of essay: "The aim of this essay is to provide critical guidance and comprehensive details to understanding the themes presented in Hamlet's Mill. The best critique of an idea lies in understanding its origins and history. The intent of anyone attempting to be a historian needs to be to hunt for facts in the attempt to close gaps in knowledge and limit the assumptions about a subject. I believe this to be important. Also, where possible, we need to understand the motives of people. This involves mustering facts (without bias) about people. I first obtained a copy of Hamlet's Mill in Boston whilst travelling through the USA in the late 1970s but was only able to give it attention circa 2000. (I still have that copy of the paperback edition even though it is now falling apart.) Also, it was only then I began acquiring a range of material to enable a detailed analysis of it. In mid September 2006 - to clarify some issues - I telephoned and spoke with Jerry and Maggie Lettvin. In circa 2005 - at considerable expense (though reasonable for the circumstances) - I obtained from an American bookseller in Paris photocopies of the 1961, 1966, and 1979 MIT seminar notes compiled by von Dechend. Unfortunately the 1961 set of notes were incomplete. (The 1961 and 1979 set of notes are indicated as complete.) Circa 2014 I obtained - courtesy of Abe Aronow - his original copies of the 1961 (incomplete) and 1966 (complete) MIT seminar notes compiled by von Dechend. It became obvious that understanding the book Hamlet's Mill (1969, and also later editions) properly involves understanding the more expansive versions of the participant notes compiled by von Dechend for the MIT seminars. This is because it is readily identifiable that the book Hamlet's Mill is compiled/assembled from selected parts of the differing versions of the MIT notes prepared for the seminars. The book Hamlet's Mill is not a revision of the MIT seminar notes on which it is based. It is obvious that nearly all - if not all - supporters of Hamlet's Mill have never seen any of the versions of the notes for the MIT seminars. This is a distinct disadvantage. To read the various versions of the notes for the MIT seminars reinforces and expands criticisms of the book."
Excursus: Maggie's Back Book by Maggie Lettvin (Boston: Houghton Mifflin). Her back injury and how she dealt with it. Other books: Maggie's Woman's Book (1980, Boston: Houghton Mifflin; Maggie's Food Strategy Book.
Instead of demonstrating a structured response to my critique both Mathisen and Briggs simply limit themselves to a number of mistaken points that are irrelevant to the case against Hamlet's Mill.
I remain dismissive of Hamlet's Mill. My critique of it is getting longer over time.
To recap in part on logical fallacies: Mattisen and Briggs like to adopt the classic unsophisticated approach to logical fallacies. I find this tiring. Such an approach is hollow in practice and without the force they seem to think it has. Why they accept this approach as apparently conclusive demolition worries me greatly. They need to get a realistic knowledge of so-called logical fallacies and their force. A reasonable starting point is Plausible Argument in Everyday Conversation by Douglas Walton (1992). One-Sided Arguments: A Dialectical Analysis of Bias (also) by Douglas Walton (1999) should not be excluded.
It is claimed that logical fallacies are invaluable. However, they are not empirically established theoretical rules. They have been mostly establish by using some (semi)formal argumentation schemes. However, science is not afraid of logical fallacies. Regardless of how some deemed logical fallacies may become mixed in with scientific investigations, science is strongly confirmationist and in the end seeks to legitimately emphasise how well data agree with a theory.
In reality, ad hominem is unrelated to sarcasm or personal abuse. Argumentum ad hominem is the logical fallacy of attempting to undermine a speaker's argument by attacking the speaker instead of addressing the argument. The mere presence of a personal attack does not indicate ad hominem: the attack must be used for the purpose of undermining the argument, or otherwise the logical fallacy isn't there. It is not a logical fallacy to attack someone; the fallacy comes from assuming that a personal attack is also necessarily an attack on that person's arguments. Therefore, if you can't demonstrate that your opponent is trying to counter your argument by attacking you, you can't demonstrate that he/she is resorting to ad hominem. If your opponent's sarcasm is not an attempt to counter your argument, but merely an attempt to insult you (or amuse the bystanders), then it is not part of an ad hominem argument. Actual instances of argumentum ad hominem are relatively rare. Ironically, the fallacy is most often committed by those who accuse their opponents of ad hominem, since they try to dismiss the opposition not by engaging with their arguments, but by claiming that they resort to personal attacks. Those who are quick to squeal "ad hominem" are often guilty of several other logical fallacies, including one of the worst of all: the fallacious belief that introducing an impressive-sounding Latin term somehow gives one the decisive edge in an argument.
Hamlet's Mill, - argument or proof
It is ridiculous to claim: "Hamlet's Mill is an argument, not a proof and the reader must decide what is their own belief in its thesis." That after 20 years of supposed investigation (late 1940's to late 1960's, and another 30 years for von Dechend) 2 academics cannot prove their case makes one wonder why they did not realise they were chasing a fantasy of their own making.
Hamlet's Mill devotees
Hamlet's Mill devotees like to believe they have a legitimate position on matters of ancient history. This is their perception rather than reality. They are not involved in any scholarly research on the themes of Hamlet's Mill and they do not publish in legitimate refereed journals. They are not involved in advancing knowledge of early history or mythology. Some supporters of Hamlet's Mill/the fantasist Graham Hancock have expressed their belief that 100 years from now historians will have accepted their viewpoints. Not explained is why it will take all the authors to be dead, all the current supporters to be dead, no real change in their arguments offered, and another 100 years for assured academic/scholarly acceptance. If they are assuming that professional academics will simply make all the moves of discovery/rediscovery then they are not stating this. Once again it is a fantasist position. After 50 years von Dechend still could not make a convincing case for precessional mythology. The German star myth school and German Panbabylonism school she built her arguments upon could not make a convincing case even after multiple authors were involved for a 30 year period. (The British star myth school had multiple authors who also failed to make a convincing case after some 20 years of effort.) Multiple modern authors have not offered a convincing case for precessional mythology after some 50 years of effort. Ignoring time overlap, after some 100 years of effort there has not been a convincing case made for precessional mythology/world ages/or monomyth.



In the background of Hamlet's Mill stands the theory of Winckler/Jeremias and the PanBabylonians about alternating (astronomical) world periods. Whenever the sun as a result of precession enters into a new sign of the zodiac; then the god of the sign in question takes over supreme rule. If the PanBabylonians had known at that time what we know today about archaic astronomy they would certainly not have written like this.
Part 13: Hamlet’s Mill and the Astronomical Interpretation of Chinese Mythology
From Deluge to Discourse: Myth, History, and the Generation of Chinese Tradition (1996) by Deborah Porter. (N. J. Girardot (2002) asserts: "Recent archaeoastronomical methods especially draw upon the multicultural and interdisciplinary insights of Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend's Hamlet's Mill ...." This book by Deborah Porter is likely an example of such. Its weaknesses are obvious. It seems unnecessary to invoke Hamlet's Mill as a basis for making astronomical interpretations of early Chinese literature. On a number of occasions an astronomical basis is claimed internally within early period Chinese literature. The use of material from the literary period of China (by David Pankenier and Deborah Porter) as examples for verifying Hamlet's Mill remain late examples of astronomy being placed into myth (by only a few persons), and also culturally limited examples.
David Pankenier (Astrology and Cosmology in Early China (2013, Page 3)) writes: "Georgio (sic) de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend, in their controversial but inspired Hamlet's Mill: An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time (1969), conjectured that astronomical knowledge was anciently encoded and transmitted in myth." This is a limited explanation.
If the 'benchmark' is the Hamlet's Mill thesis then it is important to understand that the fullest explanation of the thesis is within von Dechend's MIT seminar notes. Hamlet's Mill is simply comprised of material selected by de Santillana from these notes. The Hamlet's Mill thesis, still put very basically, is that pre-literate complex myth(s) (a complex monomyth), containing no obvious astronomical indicators, transmitted particular astronomical knowledge (and much else) and this was able to diffuse around the world. The Chinese examples used are unsatisfactory. Proceeding to argue by analogy is also unsatisfactory. The Chinese examples of king Yū and king Mu (see below) are from the literate period and do not extrapolate to the 'Hamlet's Mill benchmark.' They both have the context of a developed astronomy, early written texts, obviously sophisticated writers, astronomical indicators are claimed to be clearly in the respective stories - even if opaque, the examples are attributable to 2 persons (writers) who have no intention to propagate the story content per the Hamlet's Mill thesis.
Hamlet's Mill claims an unidentified Neolithic period culture as the originators of an astronomical monomyth that very quickly diffused around the world. This aspect is ignored by Pankenier and Port. Myth as a technical language prior to writing (pre-literate) is also not contained in the examples used by Pankenier and Porter. Sophisticated pre-literate Neolithic period astronomy - involving an equally-divided 12-constellation zodiac, a system of zodiacal 'world ages,' and exact knowledge of precession is an integral part of the Hamlet's Mill thesis. This aspect is ignored by Pankenier and Porter. Their versions have strong differences. Also integral to the Hamlet's Mill thesis is the contention that the essential combination of zodiac, 'world ages' based on it, and exact knowledge of precession as the basis for the 'world ages.' This aspect is ignored by Pankenier and Porter. Their versions have strong differences. According to the Hamlet's Mill thesis there are no indicators that the monomyth has astronomical information. According to Pankenier and Porter astronomical indicators are claimed to be clearly in the respective stories of Yū and Mu - even if opaque.
John Major (Origins of Chinese Science, PhD thesis, 1983) writes: "Myths can be used and were from the beginning intended to be understood by initiates as compendia of cosmological teachings [= cosmological themes]. They showed with a high degree of probability that a single Grand Origin Myth was shared (in term of structure, though not of course in literary details) by nearly all of the great ancient civilizations of Eurasia, and that it served as technical language for recording all of the essential features of the first of the ancient exact sciences, astronomy." This definition is followed by Deborah Porter, and also David Pankenier. (John Major writes of a Chinese version of the 'Grand Origin Myth' [= core cosmological themes described within a body of myths] concept of de Santillana/von Dechend is a complex of ideas that pervade the civilisations of Eurasia and which they believe dates back to the Neolithic period. 'Grand Origin Myth' does not appear in the Index of Hamlet's Mill.) However, the central tenet of Hamlet's Mill is the claim that there was a world-wide system of zodiacal world ages - known to be generated by precession – established in the Neolithic period. I do not see any demonstration that the content of Chinese mythology provides evidence for this. The Hamlet's Mill 'benchmark' is that pre-literate complex myth(s), containing no obvious astronomical indicators, formed a technical language that enabled worldwide transmission of precessional and other astronomical knowledge (i.e., an equally divided 12-constellation zodiac). See, for example, Hamlet's Mill Page 59 : "The sun's position among the constellations at the vernal equinox was the pointer that indicated the "hours" of the precessional cycle – very long hours indeed, the equinoctial sun occupying each zodiacal constellation for about 2,200 years. ... At Time Zero (say 5000 B.C. there are reasons for this approximate date), the sun was in Gemini, it moved ever so slowly from Gemini into Taurus, then Aries, then Pisces, which it still occupies, and will for some centuries more." The chapter heading for the prior quote is "Intermezzo: A Guide for the Perplexed." This is reinforced by the reproduction, on both the front and back endpapers of the 1970 Macmillan (Great Britain) edition, of the illustration "The Precession of the Equinoxes, shown in the order of signs, with the dates marked on the left." from The Royal Art of Astrology by Robert Eisler (1946). Any astronomical interpretation of mythology that does not fall within there parameters, and is not identified as originally originating from the Neolithic Near East, lies outside the framework of the Hamlet's Mill thesis. Modifying the central claims of Hamlet's Mill by ignoring a supposed early zodiac and associated system of 'World Ages' is essentially rejecting the central claims of Hamlet's Mill. Simply stating that the reason for 'cherry picking' is 'the authors of Hamlet's Mill did not get everything right' is a clear admission of the problems with the central tenets of the book.
Am example from a sympathetic supporter of the ideas of Hamlet's Mill. The author of "Sampson" (Aeon Journal; http://www.aeonjournal.com/articles/samson/samson.html) writes the following under the heading "Hamlet's Mill": "... Hamlet's Mill is not an easy book to read or digest. For many years now, I have labored over this book, returning to it again and again to mine the many gems contained in what is probably the most extensive collection of astral myth yet produced in the English language. Hamlet's Mill is written in an eccentric style that leaps from one theme to another, with nary a hint of how one moves from one to the other. Philip Morrison, in a review, called it a "marvelous and exasperating book," a very apt description. The classicist F. S. Kirk referred to it as an "imaginative but perverse volume," while complaining that "there is virtually nothing in the way of cogent argument." ... A central thesis of Hamlet's Mill holds that myth encodes astronomical knowledge of great complexity; specifically, an understanding of the precession of the equinoxes, which knowledge the authors suppose was obtained at some point in Neolithic times -- presumably in Mesopotamia -- and subsequently became diffused throughout the ancient world, including the Americas: "There is good reason to assume that [Hipparchos] actually rediscovered [Precession], that it had been known some thousand years previously, and that on it the Archaic age based its long-range computation of time." As the astronomer Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin observed: "By the validity of this statement the edifice will stand or fall." Kirk's assessment of this thesis was less kind: "This remarkable and improbable conclusion is presented in language that is mystical and apocalyptic as much as vague and dogmatic... " The fact that the ancient Babylonians -- the greatest astronomers of antiquity -- apparently remained ignorant of the phenomenon of precession does not bode well for the thesis of de Santillana and von Dechend. If such is the case, it is most doubtful if a large number of other cultures were aware of it either, yet this is what the thesis of Hamlet's Mill requires. In any case, given a thesis this radical in its implications -- crediting prehistoric man the world over with a relatively sophisticated understanding of science in general and astronomy in particular -- one would think that it was incumbent upon the



authors to present a wealth of evidence in favor of such knowledge. Yet such evidence is not to be found in Hamlet's Mill (nor anywhere else, I suspect). Rather, the ancient's knowledge of astronomy is simply taken for granted and the content of the myths interpreted accordingly. ... [T]he authors fail to prove their claim of sophisticated astronomical knowledge prevailing in prehistoric times ...."
There is only 1 book titled Hamlet's Mill by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend. Effectively, however, there are now 2 approaches to defining its contents. One can be termed a 'reductionist' content. This approach, adopted by a number of academics, appears to drop the central claim of the book (by stating: "Not everything they wrote is correct.") and simply focus on its claim for mythology as a technical language for astronomical information. The other approach embraces the original full content of the book and is promoted by many alternative historians. For the impetus that mythology encodes astronomy any modern author need only go to the earlier content of star-myth/Panbabylonian publications. Most of these were written by academics. Hamlet's Mill attempts to resurrect the tents of these publications. Perhaps reasons for using Hamlet's Mill as the guide to the astronomical interpretation of Chinese mythology include: (1) the relative newness of the book, (2) both its authors were academics, and (3) the book never refers to - or identifies with - Panbabylonism. However, in Hamlet's Mill, floods are connected with changing zodiacal world ages; but this is abandoned by sinologists such as Deborah Porter in the astronomical interpretation of floods in Chinese mythology.
In the 1987, an intact Neolithic tomb (now designated tomb/grave number M45) was found at Xishuipo (a Neolithic archaeological site associated with the Yangshao culture) in Puyang, Henan Province. The site was excavated from 1987 to 1988; 186 burials were discovered at the site. The Neolithic grave is dated by Chinese authorities to circa 5300 BCE (but dated circa 3000 BCE by the sinologist David Pankenier (Astrology and Cosmology in Early China (2013))) and it is assumed to be that of a king or a 'shaman' (certainly the owner was considered an elite or divine person). (According to the carbon 14 determination, and tree ring date-testing archeologists concluded that the tomb was built in the Yangshao cultural period about 6,500 years ago.) The burial arrangement suggests cosmological and astronomical significance. The tomb layout suggests a celestial pattern is being indicated. According to some interpretations a (composite) sky map is being depicted. The form of the grave itself is in the shape of a crown. The belief that heaven was composed of 6 concentric circles divided by 7 curves established how the crown shape is obtained. The adult skeleton is positioned in the centre of the unusually large cardinally oriented grave. The adult skeleton is laid out in such a way that the southern face above the head was round while the northern face at the foot of the body was square. This conforms to the symbolism of Chinese cosmology which held that Heaven was round and Earth was square. A number of astral forms keep the skeleton company. The body of a tall adult male is flanked by two carefully laid out mosaics formed from white mussel/clam shells, a tiger design to the right (west) and a dragon design to the left (east). These mosaics are believed to be representations of 2 of the 4 super constellations (the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger). In the same tomb there is also a representation of the Big Dipper (in the form of a triangle, as it would have been far in the past), also created from white mussel/clam shells. The Big Dipper is pointing toward the head of the dragon. Two human bones are placed amongst the array of symbols. Three funerary human skeletons were also found in the tomb. The burial was accompanied by the bodies of 3 young children. Clam shell mosaics were also found in two nearby caches. Another key claim is: The funerary skeleton on the north side of the M45 tomb was a young boy’s skeleton (estimated to be 15 years old when he died). At the estimated time of the burial his head was pointed in the direction of the sunrise on the Winter Solstice. Apart from being evidence of early Chinese astronomy it is not evidence of the correctness of Hamlet's Mill.
The earliest archaeological evidence of a Chinese calendar appears on the oracle bones of the late 2nd-millennium BCE. They demonstrate a 12month lunisolar year with the occasional arbitrary intercalation of a 13th- and even 14th-month. However, Chinese historical records place the origin of a lunisolar calendar (of 366 days) to circa 3000 BCE. The development of a calendar in China was closely related to the development of astronomy and the needs of agriculture. (China was largely an agricultural society.)
From Deluge to Discourse: Myth, History, and the Generation of Chinese Tradition (1996) by Deborah Porter is a fascinating astronomical interpretation of aspects of early Chinese mythology based on a 'Hamlet's Mill approach' and greatly influenced by the ideas of the sinologist David Pankenier who also believes in a 'Hamlet's Mill approach' to Chinese and other mythology. The Mu Tianzi zhuan/Mu T'ien-tzu chuan account of King Mu's journey and the flood motif is, according the Deborah Porter, not a contemporary account, but rather is a fictional account that is dated by Deborah Porter to the 4th-century BCE (i.e., the Warring States period 481-221 BCE). The themes originated from precession making the seasonal function of a particular constellation obsolete (i.e., the noting of the shifting of the equinoxes to the then inexplicable effects of precession). It is postulated by some historians of astronomy that the Neolithic Chinese had knowledge of the tropical points (i.e., equinoxes and solstices). Porter is one of a number of sinologists and others who believe the Chinese were well aware of the effects of precession prior to its actual discovery in China. This conclusion is evident from some surviving records from the Han period and also the content of some particular mythology from this period.
Deborah Porter has a PhD (Princeton University, 1989); her doctoral dissertation was titled: The Style of Shui-hu chuan. She was Assistant Professor, Department of Foreign Languages and Literature, University of Utah, 1989-1996; Associate Professor, 1996-2002. See the favourable (English-language) book review by William Nienhauser, Junior in The Journal of Asian Studies, Volume 56, Number 3, August, 1997, Pages 776779. See also the (English-language) book review by Kazuo Matsumura in Asian Folklore Studies, Volume 57, Number 1, Summer, 1995, Pages 102-104.
The earliest tentative awareness of precession in China took hold in the Hou Han (= later Han) period. (The later Han period is also now referred to as the Eastern Han Dynasty and spanned from 25 to 220 CE.) During this period it was quite widely recognised that the calendar altered (i.e., became unreliable) every 300 years. That is, every 300 years there was a requirement to use a new calendar. Multiple mentions of the fact that the calendar was only good for 300 years appears in the multiple volumes of the Hou Hanshu (= Book of the Later Han) by the historian Fan Ye (flourished 398-445 CE).
According to the sinologist Nathan Sivin (Granting the Seasons (2009, Page 100)): "... for the Chinese the initial point of the year was the winter solstice. ... The conception [of precession] evolved in several steps. Beginning at the end of the first century B.C., astronomers became aware that in observations over long periods the winter solstice point appeared at different locations among the stars. They were not certain, however, whether this was a gradual shift or the result of earlier observational errors."
The discovery of precession - or at least the hunch of its existence - is attributed by Wolfram Eberhard and Rolf Mueller to the Palace astronomer Chia K'uei (30-101 CE) of the Han dynasty. The date they give for his suspicion is circa 89 CE. (See: "Contributions to the Astronomy of the Han Period III: Astronomy of the Later Han Period." by Wolfram Eberhard and Rolf Mueller in Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, Volume 1, Number 2, July, 1936, Pages 194-241.)
The discovery of the precession of the equinoxes in China can be attributed to the scholar Yü Hsi (flourished circa 307-338 CE) circa 320 CE who discussed it in his book, the An Thien Lun written 336 CE. (The book discussed whether the motions of the heavens were stable.) Yü Hsi (281356) obtained a value of about 1 degree in 50 tropic years for the precessional movement. (This is off by almost 50 percent.)



The brilliant scholar Zu Chongzi (420-500 CE) created the Daming Calendar (some sources say promoted his father's calendar ) which took precession into account for the first time. The most thorough and comprehensive calendar in the history of China was the Dayan Calendar compiled in the Tang Dynasty (616-907 CE) by the monk Yi Xing.
Written Chinese astronomical texts first appear in the Shang Dynasty (circa 17/1600-11/1050 BCE) with the oracle bone divinations. Considerable early Chinese mythology carries sufficient hints to invite an astronomical interpretation. There is the myth of the quarrelling brothers: the legend of E Bo (Ebo) and Shi Chen (Shichen), preserved in the Zuo Commentary. It has astrological content dating to the 2nd-millennium BCE. However, there is no reason to interpret a precessional coding within the astronomical content. Also, there is the myth of the Weaver Woman/Girl (Zhi Nu) and Oxherd (Niulang). It was well established and popular during the upheavals of the Period of Disunity (circa 220-590 CE), between the collapse of the Han Dynasty and the establishment of the T'ang Dynasty. The earliest model for the weaving woman is found in the Classic of Poetry (circa 600 BCE, but a collection of verses from roughly 1000 BCE to 600 BCE) which briefly relates the myth of the stellar goddess Weaver Woman (Chih Nü). (See: Games Poets Play: Readings in Medieval Chinese Poetry by Anne Birrell (2004, Page 148).)
Chinese examples of astronomical mythology are somewhat scarce and do not meet the Hamlet's Mill 'benchmark.' The particular example of the fictional historical work Mu Tien-tzu chuan (purportedly a book on King Mu's tours to China's northwest borders) is: (1) from the literate period (the example is an early written text by an obviously sophisticated writer), (2) a sophisticated (post-Neolithic) astronomy was in existence, (3) there are sufficient astronomical indicators clearly in the story - even if the story is opaque, (4) this one example is attributable to one person who has no intention to propagate world-wide, and (5) the story is not specifically focused on precessional events. Guo Pu (276-324 CE), a natural historian, scholar, and also a versatile and prolific writer of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420 CE), is identified as the author of the Mu Tien-tzu chuan. However, a Warring States Period (circa 5th- to 3rd-century BCE) date of composition is thought likely by a number of sinologists. For Deborah Porter (From Deluge to Discourse (1996)) the story contains information that derives from precessional effects. The Chinese have more than one flood myth, the most common being the Gun-Yū myth. For a detailed interpretation of the myths of Yū and his control of the great inundation of floodwaters as the observable workings of precession (a theme contained in the Mu Tien-tzu chuan) see, From Deluge to Discourse (1996) by Deborah Porter. This interpretation has also been made by the sinologists John Major and David Pankenier. King Mu was subject to two different legendary traditions in classical Chinese sources. A non astronomical - simply political - interpretation of flood myths connected with King Mu is set out by Mark Lewis in his 2006 book, The Flood Myths of Early China. It is a comprehensive study of Han period flood myths. Explores how the flood myths of early China provided a template for that society's major social and political institutions. Lewis sets out a convincing case that the Chinese flood myths are a metaphor for establishing the legitimacy of terrestrial political authority - the terrestrial ruler and his authority, and social order established through the political institutions of the Warring States and Han period. The flood myths were aimed at achieving a unified polity in China with the new political order arising from the Warring Sates period. Articulated during the Warring States and Han periods (206 BCE-220 CE) the flood myths provided sanction for the political, social, and cultural institutions that promoted imperial unity. Yū's taming of the floods provided legitimacy for the centralised political institutions that were envisioned during the Warring States period and implemented during the Han period. I have not been able to identify any response by Deborah Porter or David Pankenier to the case set out in The Flood Myths of Early China.
From https://history.stanford.edu/people/mark-edward-lewis: "His third book, The Construction of Space in Early China, examines the formation of the Chinese empire through its reorganization and reinterpretation of its basic spatial units: the human body, the household, the city, the region, and the world. It shows how each higher unit—culminating in the empire—claimed to incorporate and transcend the units of the preceding level, while in practice remaining divided and constrained by the survival of the lower units, whose structures and tensions they reproduced. A companion volume, The Flood Myths of Early China, shows how these early Chinese ideas about the constituent elements of an ordered, human space—along with the tensions and divisions therein—were elaborated and dramatized in a set of stories about the re-creation of a structured world from a watery chaos that had engulfed it." From the publisher’s blurb: "Early Chinese ideas about the construction of an ordered human space received narrative form in a set of stories dealing with the rescue of the world and its inhabitants from a universal flood. This book demonstrates how early Chinese stories of the re-creation of the world from a watery chaos provided principles underlying such fundamental units as the state, lineage, the married couple, and even the human body. These myths also supplied a charter for the major political and social institutions of Warring States (481–221 BC) and early imperial (220 BC–AD 220) China. In some versions of the tales, the flood was triggered by rebellion, while other versions linked the taming of the flood with the creation of the institution of a lineage, and still others linked the taming to the process in which the divided principles of the masculine and the feminine were joined in the married couple to produce an ordered household. While availing themselves of earlier stories and of central religious rituals of the period, these myths transformed earlier divinities or animal spirits into rulers or ministers and provided both etiologies and legitimation for the emerging political and social institutions that culminated in the creation of a unitary empire." Yū was not a merely a man battling a flood catastrophe, but was considered a demi-god who was able to change shape. Yū passed on leadership to his descendants - the first time succession passed through a blood line - and established the oldest family dynasty in China. A more mundane interpretation is the building projects of Yū protected China from frequent floods. (See also: Puett, Michael. (2007). "Innovation as Ritualization: The Fractured Cosmology of Early China." (Cardozo Law Review, Volume 28, Number 1, Pages 23-36).)

In his recent book Astrology and Cosmology in Early China: Conforming Earth to Heaven (2013), Pankenier describes (page 3) de Santillana and von Dechend's Hamlet's Mill as "controversial but inspired." The book has been controversial but its weaknesses are readily evident; it offers no original inspiration but merely a repetition of Panbabylonism. Pankenier's key belief (the 'linchpin' of the book (see page 12) is there a link between multiple planetary groupings (especially five planets in close proximity) with dynastic transitions and the notion of the ruler's 'mandate of heaven'. In Chapter 6, 'The Cosmo-Political Mandate,' Pankenier widens and deepens the scope of his theory. See the critical (English-language) book review by the Sinologist Daniel Patrick Morgan (CNRS – Université Paris Diderot) in Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Volume 77, Issue 2, June, 2014, Pages 404 - 406.

In World Mythology (1993) edited by Roy Willis; John Chinnery writes (Page 95): "Stellar gods, each associated with a particular star or group of stars, existed from ancient times and were especially numerous in the Taoist pantheon. They included gods of literature, longevity, happiness, and so on. Most stellar myths were a comparatively late development in Chinese religion and folklore, but one famous star myth, about Yi, a divine archer with magic powers, dates at least as far back as the 6th century B.C." This is definitely not the Neolithic period.



Interestingly, the renowned sinologist Edward Schafer (1913-1991) (Agassiz Professor of Oriental Languages at the University of California, Berkeley) wrote (Pacing the Void: T'ang Approaches to the Stars (1977, Page 315): "Santillana and Dechend, 1969, 177, referring chiefly to western star lore, write: "... the constellations were seen as the setting, or the dominating influences or even only the garments at the appointed time by the Powers in various disguises on their way through their heavenly adventures." Assuming that this characterization is a reasonable one, it is not entirely applicable to the Chinese stellar hierarchy, which was far from being an adventurous one."
For the construct of an ancient quadrilateral "ideal plane" of earth as a modern concept see the critical discussion of the claim (made in Hamlet's Mill) by John Didier in his In and Outside the Square, Volume III, Sino-Platonic Papers, Number 192, 2009. John Didier also points out there is no evidence that the proto-Chinese conceived of "mythical earth" at all.

Excursus: Greek Astral Myths
The worship of celestial objects was not a native feature of Greek religion. Martin Nilsson (1874-1967, a Professor of Classical Archaeology) showed that the older Greeks had few star myths. Also, the Classical Greeks associated astral cults with the barbarians. Earlier, George Lewis (1806-1863), An Historical Survey of the Astronomy of the Ancients (1862), made the point that the religion and mythology of the early Greeks had scarcely any reference to astronomy, or to the adoration of the celestial bodies. Also, the divination practices of the early Greeks had little connection with the celestial bodies. Early Greek divination practices involved the use of oracles, dreams, entrails (innards), and the flight of birds. The Greeks also drew prognostics from prodigies ('wondrous rare natural phenomenon'), among which comets, meteors, and eclipses held an important place.
Greek mythical stories which have an astronomical reference are comparatively recent in origin. Greek astral legends are an aspect of Alexandrianism, and genuinely early Greek astral myths are rare. Occasionally a Greek myth was given an astronomical meaning by later writers, which it lacked in its earlier form. From the 6th-century BCE onwards, legends concerning the constellation subjects were frequently treated by the Greek historians and poets.
From the 6th-century BCE onwards, legends concerning the constellation subjects were frequently treated by the Greek historians and poets.
Greek philosophy from its beginnings tended to regard celestial objects as divine. This happened partly because the Greek philosophers were impressed by the regularity of the movement of the fixed stars, and also partly because of the influence of the astral content of the religious beliefs of the neighbouring oriental countries. During circa the beginning of the 3rd-century BCE Greek philosophy was opened up to astral religion by the Stoics, whose founder, Zeno of Citium (Cyprus), began to teach in Athens. Stoic determinism and Babylonian astral religion were natural allies. With the Greek conquest of the Persian empire in the 2nd-half of the 4th-century BCE previous border limitations collapsed and regular cultural and intellectual exchange between Greece and Babylon was enabled.
"After the Persian conquest of Egypt during the sixth century BCE, Babylonian star religion had become closely linked with the indigenous of that country. In the Ptolemaic kingdom established by the Greek during the fourth century, an astrological literature written in Greek but made out of Babylonian, Egyptian, and Greek elements came into being. The so-called Hermetic books compiled between 50 BCE and 150 CE contain a complete theology [astral mysticism] which spread rapidly throughout the Roman world." (Myths of the Zodiac by Hugh Lloyd-Jones (1978).)
Part 14: The Origin of the Mythological School
A spate of somewhat speculative etymological derivations led to numerous hasty conclusions which peaked in the so-called mythological school of thought, a field of research concerned with the reconstruction of Indo-European myths. The mythological/nature school relied on the comparative method and took for granted the concept of the 'psychic unity' of humankind. It has been pointed out that what is termed the Mythological School actually consisted of a highly varied loose 'grouping' of scholars who not only held widely divergent views but who also changed their ideas and approaches considerable over time.
The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1979):
"The Mythological School was a trend in 19th-century folklore and literary studies that arose during the romantic period. Its philosophical basis was the aesthetics of F. W. von Schelling and the brothers A. and F. von Schlegel, who perceived mythology as "natural religion." [The German philosopher Friedrich Schelling (1775-1854) was an influential thinker in the tradition of 'German idealism.' His book, Philosophy of Mythology is based on his 1842 lectures. Schelling proposed a primary original monotheism followed by a mythological polytheism. August von Schlegel (1767-1845) was a German poet, poetical translator, and critic. His brother Friedrich von Schlegel (1772-1829) was a German poet, critic, writer on æsthetics, and literary historian. The brothers are regarded as the founders of the Romantic School.] The mythological school characteristically conceived of mythology as "the necessary condition and primary material for all art" (Schelling) and as "the kernel and center of poetry" (F. Schlegel). Schelling's and F. Schlegel's belief that a renaissance in national art is possible only if artists turn to mythology was propagated by A. Schlegel and was applied to folklore by the Heidelberg romantics (L. J. von Arnim, C. Brentano, and J. von Görres). The mythological school received definitive treatment in the works of the brothers W. and J. Grimm (German Mythology, 1835). According to their theory, folk poetry had a divine origin; the evolution of myth gave rise to the fairy tale, epic song, legend, and other genres; folklore was the unconscious and impersonal creation of the "national soul." Using the comparative method, the brothers Grimm attributed analogous phenomena in the folklore of different peoples to a more ancient, universal mythology.
"Friedrich Schlegel's 1808 study On the Language and Wisdom of the Indians (Über die Sprache und Weisheit der Indier) firmly accredited to India the origin of European language and indeed civilization." (The Science of the Swastika by Bernard Mees (2008, Page 75.)
The mythological school gained acceptance in many European countries, including Germany (A. Kuhn, W. Schwartz, W. Mannhardt), England (M. Müller, G. Cox), Italy (A. de Gubernatis), France (M. Breal), Switzerland (A. Pictet), and Russia (A. N. Afanas'ev, F. I. Buslaev, and O. F. Miller). [The Russian folklorist (of German origin) Orest F. Miller (1833 (Estonia)-1889 (Russia)) was a professor in Russian literature who researched Russian mythology and folk culture. He authored numerous books. He examined Russian epics through the prism of a solar and
meteorological myth. See: Sravnitel'no-kriticheskie nablyudeniya nad sloevym sostavom narodnogo russkogo eposa (1869). Also, Ilya Muromets and the Kievan bogatyrs (1869). Orest Miller was a proponent of the mythological school who helped influence Russian ethnography. (Vsevolod Fedorovich (/Fiodorovich) Miller (1848-1913) Russian philologist, folklorist, linguist, ethnologist, and archaeologist, was the brother of Orest Fiodorovich. Vsevolod Miller was a professor at Moscow University from 1884. He helped to establish scientific principles for the study of folklore.)] There were two principal trends: the etymological (linguistic reconstruction of the primary meaning of myth) and the analogical (comparison of myths with similar content). The etymological trend was represented by the works of Kuhn (The Descent of Fire and the Drink of



the Gods, 1859; On the Stages of Myth-formation, 1873) and Müller (Essay on Comparative Mythology, 1856; and Lectures on the Science of Language, 1862–64). Using the palaeolinguistic method, Kuhn and Müller tried to reconstruct ancient mythology, explaining myths as the deification of natural phenomena, such as heavenly bodies (Müller's solar theory) and thunderstorms (Kuhn's meteorological theory).
In Russia, the etymological study of myths was treated in an original way by Buslaev (Historical Essays on Russian Folk Literature and Art, 1861). He derived the heroes of the byliny (epic folk songs) from myths about the origin of rivers (Dunai, the Danube) and about giants living in the mountains (Sviatogor). The Russian scholar [Orest (sometimes, incorrectly, Alexei/Aleksei)] Miller was an extreme proponent of the solarmeteorological theory, as in his II'ia Muromets and the Bogatyri of Kiev (1869).
The demonological, or naturalistic, theory of Schwartz (The Origin of Mythology, 1860) and Mannhardt (Demons of the Rye, 1868; Forest and Field Cultures, 1875–77; Mythological Studies, 1884) arose within the analogical trend. The demonological theory saw the origin of myths in the worship of “lower” demonic beings.
In The Slavs' Poetical Views of Nature (1866–69), Afanas'ev provided an original synthesis of the various theories of the mythological school. [Aleksandr Afanas'ev/Afanasev (1826-1871) was a Russian historian and scholar in the fields of literature and folklore. His work, The Slavs' Poetic View of Nature (/The Poetic Outlook on Nature by the Slavs) (Volumes 1–3, 1866-1869) was based on the principles of the mythological school.] The influence of the mythological school is also evident in the early works of A. N. Pypin (On Russian Folktales, 1856) and A. N. Veselovskii (Comparative Mythology and Its Methodology, 1873). [Aleksandr Pypin (1833-1904) was a Russian scholar, literary historian, and ethnologist. Aleksandr Veselovsky (1838-1906) was a Russian literary historian and literary theorist.]
The methodology and many of the theoretical conclusions of the mythological school were refuted by subsequent scholarship, which included the proponents of the migration theory and the former "mythologists" Buslaev and Veselovskii. [Fyodor (Fedor) Buslaev (1818-1908) was a Russian philologist and art historian. He was appointed assistant professor of Russian literature at the University of Moscow. He was profoundly influenced by the German scholars Jacob Grimm and Theodor Benfey. Buslaev’s major work, Historical Sketches of Russian Folk Literature and Art (Volumes 1-2, 1861) characterizes Buslaev as the most consistent spokesman for the mythological school in Russian science. Buslaev tied language, poetry and mythology together and he regarded folklore as the non-individual creation of the people - "fragments of ancient myths." Buslaev later joined the so-called 'Borrowing School' (= migratory theory?). In the work, Wandering Tales (1874; published in the collection My Leisure Time, 1886), Buslaev developed and propagandized the ideas of the German scholar Theodor. Benfey and came to the conclusion that the homeland of European narrative folklore is the East. Buslaev's work in the field of comparative literature was continued by his numerous students, notably Alexander Veselovsky.] However, the school played an important role in the development of mythological studies: it expanded the concept of mythology by turning to the myths of the ancient Indians, Iranians, Germans, Celts, and Slavs, as well as to the classical myths; it furthered the collection of the folklore of different peoples; it posed a series of important theoretical questions (including the question of the national character of art); and it laid the foundations for the comparative study of mythology, folklore, and literature. While critically evaluating the mythological school's exaggeration of the role of mythology in the history of art, the trends that replaced the school continued to study the problem of the "mythologism" of folklore and literature, using the voluminous materials gathered by the earlier trend."
Regarding George Cox (1827-1902). Proponent of Pan-Aryanism. British classicist, historian, and comparative mythologist. Born in Benares, India, and educated at Rugby and Trinity College, Oxford. In 1850 he was ordained, and in 1860 took a mastership at Cheltenham College, which he held for only 1 year. In 1881 he was made vicar of Scrayingham, York, but resigned in 1897. In 1896 he was given a civil list pension. From 1861 he devoted himself entirely to literary work, chiefly in connexion with history and comparative mythology. His studies in mythology were influenced by Max Muller, but his treatment of the subjects was his own. He was an extreme supporter of the solar and nebular theory as the explanation of myths. Cox accepted the existence of nature myths other than solar. For Cox myths which are not solar are stellar or nebular. See his books: The Mythology of the Aryan Nations (1870, new edition 1882); and An Introduction to the Science of Comparative Mythology (1881).
The British scholar Benjamin Thorpe regarded the gods/goddesses as personifications of meteorological, astronomical, or atmospheric events. See: Northern Mythology by Benjamin Thorpe (3 volumes, 1851).
Part 15: The Origin of the Nature Myth School
Excursus: Comparative mythology perhaps began with Creuzer's Symbolik (4 Volumes, 1810-1812). It ended with the school of Max Müller at the end of the 19th-century. It was renewed (on a firmer basis) with George Dumézil (1898-1986, French comparatist philologist) in the entre-deux period. Dumézil was concerned to rehabilitate the field of comparative mythology. Dumézil's approach to comparative mythology is closely based upon sociological and anthropological assumptions. (See (the rather uncritical): The New Comparative Mythology: An Anthropological Assessment of the Theories of George Dumézil by C. Scott Littleton (1966, reprinted 1982).) Towards the end of his career Dumézil rejected a lot of his former ideas about mythology.
Georg Friedrich Creuzer (German: 1771-1858) was a German classical scholar, philologist and archaeologist. Creuzer studied at the universities of Marburg and Jena and lived for a time in Leipzig as a private tutor. He served as professor of philology and ancient history at the University of Heidelberg almost continuously from 1804 to 1845. He is best known for having advanced a theory that the mythology of Homer and Hesiod came from an Oriental source through the Pelasgians, a pre-Hellenic people of the Aegean region, and that Greek mythology contained elements of the symbolism of an ancient revelation. See Creuzer's first and most famous work presenting his theory, Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Völker, besonders der Griechen (4 volumes, 1810-1812, 2nd edition 1819, 3rd edition 1837). His controversial ideas were often the subject of vigorous criticism. Creuzer maintained that the mythology of Homer and Hesiod came from an Eastern source through the Pelasgians, and reflected the symbolism of an ancient revelation; as a reconciliation with Judeo-Christian religion. It was also a book full of racial thinking.
Naturmythologie prevalent in the middle and late 19th-century has been described as little more than popular romantic naturism. The nature-myth approach was basically German and focused especially on Indo-European religions. The decline of Aryan romanticism and of the school of nature mythology has been described as being due to both intra-scientific reasons and general cultural events.
Max Müller
The philological movement of the mid and late 19th-century considered folktales as broken-down remnants of an ancient lore belonging to the Aryan cultures of India and the Middle East. Müller associated solar mythology with the 'pure' religion of the Aryans. In 1856 the philologist Max Müller in his long essay on what he termed 'comparative mythology' argued that mythology (especially Greek mythology) was a tool for the metaphorical expression of physical forces (natural science). According to Müller linguistic processes generate mythology, which in turn, is centred on solar religion. Max Müller, with his treatment of modern folktales as vestiges of allegories of nature (especially sun-related myths) was the chief spokesperson for the philological movement. The German scholar Max Müller in the 19th-century defined myths as metaphors/allegories for solar phenomena. Max Müller (1823-1900) was a Sanskrit scholar and philologist, and professor at Oxford, who founded the study of



comparative religion. He was one of the founders of comparative myth investigation and also of the nature school of interpretation of myths. Müller believed he had laid the foundation for a scientific investigation of mythology by distinguishing between the real natural phenomena they dealt with and the imaginative (mythical) explanation given to explain the phenomena. (An approach mimicked in Hamlet's Mill.) Max Müller was very influential for the entire 2nd-half of the 19th-century. During the 1850s and 1860s Müller proposed a number of philologically-based theories on the nature of Aryan mythology. His ideas saw the establishment of an influential school of comparative mythology/folklore research ("nature myth movement") which abruptly- and almost completely – disappeared around the turn of the 20th-century. There were several notable exceptions. One exception was Wilhelm Schwartz (Friedrich Leberecht Wilhelm Schwartz, 1821-1899) who continued to vigorously promote
nature myth interpretations (see his: Ursprung der stamm- und gründungssage Roms unter dem reflex indogermanischer mythen (1898)). Another exception was Georg Hüsing who held that all myths were solar myths (see his: Contributions to the Kyros Myth (1906)). (The discrediting of nature mythology coincided with the growth of anthropology based on field observation in a single culture. An exception was Georges Dumézil, who compared structure, not etymology.) Müller was an ardent solar mythologist who thought that nearly all myths were symbolic/allegorical stories about the rising and setting sun, light and darkness, and the seasons. Some followers of Müller's approach quickly modified the original theory and espoused nature mythology. Myths were explanations of meteorological and cosmological phenomena. In this view deities were associated with one or more natural phenomena such as clouds and thunderstorms. Comparative mythology in the 19th-century was driven by the wide acceptance of interpretations of myths as natural phenomena, primarily the sun and moon, etc. (See the article: "Some third thoughts on Max Müller and solar mythology." by Michael Carroll (European Journal of Sociology, Volume 26, Number 2, November 1985, Pages 262-290).)
In the 19th-century Andrew Lang criticised the notion that myths could be easily compared through merely textual methods and showed that the philological approach to mythology by Muller and Schmidt was unreliable, being merely a form of armchair anthropology.
Aldabert Kuhn
Slightly prior to Max Muller the German philologist and folklorist Franz [Aldabert] Kuhn (1812-1881) was an important early adherent of nature mythology. He was the originator of the meterological school of naturism. Kuhn emphasised thunderstorms and their attendant lightning rather than the sun. See: his Die Herabkunft des Feuers und des Göttertranks (1859). In the 19th-century Adalbert Kuhn and Wilhelm Schwartz (also misspelled Schwarz), and also Carl Muellehoff, held to a "meteorological theory" of folklore. They believed that folklore/myths could be traced to the deification of thunderstorms, lightning, and winds. However, there was no way to test these theories. Until the growth of anthropology nobody really bothered to investigate living people – the actual sources of many myths – and ask what they thought their myths meant. Kuhn made important contributions to comparative philology, and is regarded as the founder of the science of comparative Indo-Germanic mythology. From 1841 he was connected with the Kollnisches Gymnasium at Berlin, and he was appointed its director in 1870. Kuhn was the founder of a new school of comparative mythology, based upon comparative philology. Inspired by Jakob Grimm's Deutsche Mythologie, he initially devoted himself to German stories and legends but his reputation is founded on his later researches into the language and history of the Indo-Germanic peoples as a whole. He maintained that the origin of myths is to be looked for in the domain of language.
Interestingly, the American John Fiske (1842-1901), a philosopher and historian who taught at a number of universities, attempted to reconcile the meteorological and solar varieties of naturism. See: Myths and Myth-Makers.
Ludwig Preller
Ludwig Preller (15 September 1809–21 June 1861) was a German philologist and antiquarian. Preller was born in Hamburg, he studied at Leipzig, Berlin and Göttingen, in 1838 he was appointed to the professorship of philology at the University of Dorpat, which, however, he resigned in 1843. He afterwards spent some time in Italy, but settled in Jena in 1844, where he became professor in 1846. In 1847 he relocated as head librarian to Weimar. His chief works are: Demeter und Persephone (1837), Griechische Mythologie (2 Volumes, 1854–1855) and Römische Mythologie (1858). He also co-operated with Heinrich Ritter in the preparation of the most useful Historia philosophiae graecae et romanae ex fontium locis contexta (1838). Also, he contributed extensively to Ersch and Gruber's Allgemeine Encyklopädie and Pauly's Realencyklopädie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft. Preller emphasised the sky in interpreting myths. (Müller emphasised the sun; Kuhn emphasised storm clouds; Schwartz emphasised the wind; and Preller emphasised the sky.)
Ernst Siecke
Ernst Siecke (1846-1935) (Germany) Philologist?/Teacher/Author/Editor. His published PhD thesis seems to have been, De Niso et Scylla in Aves mutatis (Scripsit Ernestus Siecke, 1884, 15 pages). At head of title: Wissenschaftliche beilage zum Programm des Friedrichs-gymnasiums. Ostern [Easter?] 1884. - "Programm no. 56." Ernst Siecke was a teacher, a member of the staff of a prestigious Berlin high school, FriedrichsGymnasium. He was a proponent of the German Volk and was openly anti-Semitic, but not openly anti-Semitic towards Jewish students in his classes. (See: The Crisis of German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich by George Mosse (1981, Page 156). Also: Die Judenfrage und der Gymnasiallehrer by Ernst Siecke (1880).) It appears likely that Siecke was a follower of Adolf Stöcker. Adolf Stöcker (1835-1909) was the court chaplain to Kaiser Wilhelm II, a politician, and a German Lutheran theologian who founded one of the first Christian Social Gospel political parties in Germany, the (anti-Semitic) Christian Social Party. He found that he could attract more followers to his conservative Christian Social political movement by attacking the Jews in Germany. The German folklorist Ernst Siecke was the real founder and most active supporter of the star-myth movement. In 1892 Siecke published his Liebesgeschichte des Himmels. This was the first of his many books and pamphlets supporting an astronomical interpretation of mythology. According to Siecke, myths must be understood literally because their contents always refer to some specific celestial phenomena, namely the forms and movements of the planets, stars, and moon. The result of his publications was that interest in star myths generally and the particular interest in Babylon had a mutual affect on each other and resulted in their combining together. Ernst Siecke interpreted Indo-Germanic mythology as a struggle between the sun and the moon.
Both Siecke (Indo-Germanic myths) and Hüsing (Iranian myths) identified what they believed was lunar symbolism in myths.
According to Joseph Campbell (Flight of the Wild Geese, 2002, Page 199), Siecke followed the lead of Max Müller and cogitated on the lunar phases and the interplay of sun and moon. It appears that Max Müller was an influence on Siecke's early star myth books/monographs, Die Liebesgeschichte des Himmels (1892) and Die Urreligion der Indogermanen (1897). Both these publications supported "Panlunarism." The StarMyth Movement laid emphasis on the predominant importance of the Moon ("Panlunarism") and also the sun. According to Siecke (Indogermanische Mythologie, 1921) the wolf as swallower is the dark of the moonwhile Little Red Riding Hood is the bright moon that comes back to life after being released from the wolf's stomach. Siecke identified that the number 9 occurs conspicuously in numerous moon sagas and saw its origin in an ancient application in time division. See also Siecke's early publication: Beiträge zur genaueren Erkenntnis der Mondgottheit bei den Griechen (1885). (Note: The title also appears as: Beiträge zur genaueren Kenntnis der Mondgöttin bei den Griechen (1885). Eduard Stucken also likely followed the nature-myth theories of Max Müller.



There is nothing compelling in the attempts at an astronomical interpretation of Little Red Riding Hood. (Also, there is nothing compelling in the attempts at an astronomical interpretation of The Hare and the Hedgehog.) The interesting thesis of Catherine Orenstein appeared in expanded form in 2002 as Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked. Her researches indicate that the fairy tale form originated with Charles Perrault in the 17thcentury French court of King Louis XIV as a ribald morality tale. The ultimate origin of the story is traced to the European werewolf trials of the 15th and 16th centuries. There is no hint of anything astronomical here. But in Fairy Tales from Before Fairy Tales by Jan M. Ziolkowski (2009 (Three - A Cautionary Tale - Little Red Riding Hood in the 1020s; Pages 93-124) the foundations of the tale is traced back to the early 11thcentury tale "About a Girl Saved from Wolf Cubs" published (circa 1022-1024) by Egbert Egbert of Liege (a teacher in the cathedral school there) in his schoolbook, A Richly Laden Ship.
Hamlet's Mill and the Nature Myth School
19th-century theories of myth held the subject of myth to be the physical world and the function of myth was to explain events in the physical world. Myths were about reality. Myth was considered the "primitive" counterpart to modern natural science. 20th-century theories of myth held myth to be about anything but an attempt to explain the physical world. Myth is imaginative and could be expressive and involve projections about the social world, and human behaviour. Hamlet's Mill is an attempt to revive the 19th-century approach to myth being about reality. In Hamlet's Mill myth is not quite an explanation of the physical world but rather a way to relay information about it. In Hamlet's Mill, Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend attempt to show that astronomical calculations underlie various myths. Using the explanation of secrecy engaged in by ancient astronomers they are confident they have explained why events are not just passed on as observations but are transformed into complex stories. They then present "rules" by which the astronomical knowledge may be rediscovered. This is the only part imagination plays. Hamlet's Mill rejects the role of fantasy as a basis for myth and retains the 19th-century theories.
Part 16: Viktor Rydberg
The great credence given to Rydberg's theories by the authors of Hamlet's Mill is an example of their reliance on arguments by a hobbyist from the pioneering period of comparative mythological studies.
Viktor Rydberg's 'investigations' are questionable for a number of reasons, encompassing use of material and imaginative synthesis. He was ignored/dismissed by scholars at the time he published and is largely ignored/dismissed by modern scholars. Some modern support for Rydberg such as demonstrated in Hamlet's Mill - originates in a the belief that Rydberg demonstrated great understanding and integrity with the material. Rydberg was one researcher to really "get it." The authors of Hamlet's Mill believed that many 20th-century academics involved in the study of mythology and science were lacking motivation and were not on a par with the academic standards of some 19th-century scholars and also some early 20th-century scholars. De Santillana and von Dechend preferred to accept Rydberg's conclusions over modern scholars. However, Rydberg was imaginative with his use of material and certainly imaginative with his development/invention of a "synthesis" (grand system), which was regarded as absurd from the outset. He worked more as an amateur than an academic. He made no attempt to limit his studies to what actually existed and to limit himself to justifiable insights. Rydberg's 'method' consisted of detaching and drawing together dissimilar stories, claiming a meaning for them that cannot be sustained by a critical examination of the evidence, and fabricating an overall explanatory edifice that was wholly artificial and only existing within in his imagination. Part of Rydberg's method was to combine material in the Snorri's Poetic Edda with that of the mythological elements found in Saxo's Gesta Danorum. The American (misidentified as Swedish by some) poet and folk-scholar Mark Puryear is a modern supporter of Rydberg. Mark Puryear is also a supporter of the Oera Linda Book, a nationalist forgery of circa the mid 19th-century. A consensus of scholars agree it does any contain genuine compilation of folklore. The Nature of Asatru: An Overview of the Ideals and Philosophy of the Indigenous Religion of North Europe by Mark Puryear (2006).
At the time of Rydberg's publications the German school of Nature mythology dominated the field of studies. Abraham Victor Rydberg (18281895) a Swedish writer (author, journalist, poet and novelist) has both enthusiastic supporters (who consider him an early authority on Teutonic/Germanic myth) and informed detractors consider him speculative and subjective. He has been described as "Primarily a classical idealist" and "Sweden's last Romantic." He first attracted attention with his novel The Doctrine of Christ According to the Bible (1859). He was highly regarded as a novelist was regarded as one of Sweden's leading literary figures. The focus for his detractors is his Teutonic Mythology (2 volumes, 1886-1889). (See: Undersökningar i germanisk mythologi, första delen (1886), (Investigations into Germanic Mythology, Volume I), translated 1889; Undersökningar i germanisk mythologi, andre delen (1889), (Investigations into Germanic Mythology, Volume 2, Parts 1 & 2). It is stated that Rydberg started Teutonic Mythology as an attempt to save the Old Norse Eddaic myths from allegations of Christian and Classical influence. He then began to form the idea that they were not only very ancient but also fragments of a vast and coherent mythical epic. He then laboured for almost a decade trying to reconstruct and prove this epic. The results set out in the volumes comprising Teutonic Mythology were largely dismissed by other scholars as his poetical imaginations. "The main thesis in Undersokningar is that the originally individual myths were arranged in an epical chain, starting with chaos and creation, and ending with Ragnarök and the new creation, during the Neolithic period (the oldest Indo-European age, according to Rydberg. Rydberg sees the epical chain as the essence of the Teutonic and Indo-Iranian mythologies. He probably got this idea from the Old Norse poem Völuspá, which contains a kind of eschatological epos. The focus on apocalypse and eschatology in the ancient Iranian religion probably also inspired him. (Viktor Rydberg och den jämförande indoeuropeiska religionshistorien = Viktor Rydberg and the comparative study of the history of Indo-European religion by Anna Lindén (2004, Doktorand, Lund University))" From 1838 to 1847 Rydberg went to school in Jönköping where he attended the Vaxjö Superior School (= Grammar School), and afterwards he studied law at the University of Lund for 1 year (1851-1852). Lack of funds compelled him to quite the University of Lund without completing a degree. He then became a private tutor. At the age of 27 he was befriended by the editor of "Goteborgs Handels - och Sjöfartstidning" and appointed as a contributor to the newspaper. Over a period of 20 years he wrote articles on a variety of subjects for the newspaper, as well as short stories and serialised novels. From 1870 to 1872, Rydberg was a member of the Swedish Parliament as a supporter of the Peasant's Party. For his lifetime of literary achievement, Rydberg received an honorary doctorate from the University of Uppsala. In 1888 ("The New York Times" obituary has 1877) he was elected a member of the Swedish Academy. In 1889, he was also elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Starting 1883 he was a teacher, then from 1884 ("The New York Times" obituary has 1877) he was appointed professor, of the History of Culture at the Superior School of Stockholm (högskola), now Stockholm University, and from 1889 as the first holder of the J. A. Berg Chair of the History and Theory of Art, also at Stockholm University. Between 1886 and 1889, his literary work was focused on Norse and broader Germanic mythology. Rydberg identified the mill in the sea (the Ocean-Mill) with the "world-mill ("heavenly-mill/"cosmic-mill")" of Scandinavian mythology, which supposedly produced the regular motion of the starry sky and also of the sea (the Maelstrom). (See his: Investigations into Germanic Mythology (1886).) The "world-mill" involves the analogy of the rotating sky and a rotating mill. Rydberg's conjecture of a world mill turning the constellations has been taken up in Hamlet's Mill and given a central focus. Henrik Schück wrote at the turn of the 20th-century that he considered Viktor Rydberg the "last - and poetically most gifted - of the mythological school founded by Jacob Grimm and represented by such men as Adalbert Kuhn" which is very synthetic in approach to understanding of myth.
Note: Within the Scandinavian/classical scheme proponents of Hamlet's Mill continue to assert the Great Beat constellation (Ursa Major/Arktos) was responsible for the turning of the fixed stars (and was also responsible for the seasons).



When considering the overall academic independence and integrity of German mythological studies during the course of the nineteenth century, especially those nature based approaches supported by Hamlet's Mill, the issue of their shaping and intent is not without interest. "Over the course of the nineteenth century, Old Germanic studies had been strongly influenced by the discourses of German nationalism." (The Science of the Swastika by Bernard Mees (2008, Page 274.)
Part 17: Astronomical Interpretation of Mythology
Astronomical interpretation of mythology
There has been a tendency amongst 19th- and 20th-century mythologists to look for a single method or explanation that would clarify what mythology is all about.
The French scholar Charles Dupuis was the founder of astralism and his bloated Origine des tous les cultes: ou, Religion universelle is the ancestor of all modern European works on astral mythology. (19th-century astral mythology has been described as the prototype of 20th-century archaeoastronomy.). Dupuis may have been influenced by astral theories of myth set out in Histoire du ciel [L'histoire du ciel] by Noël-Antoine Pluche (1739), a French priest. Charles Dupuis (1742-1809) and Comte de Volney (Constantin François de Chassebœuf; 1757-1820) (both French scholars) were pioneers in arguing for an astral-mythical interpretation of Jesus and Christianity, and other stories. Dupuis was also perhaps inspired by Macrobius of the 5th-century CE in tracing the solar zodiac to Egypt, and placing its date at circa 13,000 BCE; when the flow of the Nile with its consequent harvests, and the seasons, were believed to coincide with the positions of the separate figures and the characters assigned to them. He was also motivated by the antireligious fervour of post-revolutionary France (the period of the French Revolution dated 1789-1799). Charles Dupuis explained all religious myths as astronomical in origin. Charles Dupuis tried to prove that all primitive religions were evolved from a system of astral mythology originating in Upper Egypt. See: Dupuis, Charles François. (1794/1795). Origine des tous les cultes: ou, Religion universelle. (7 Volumes (in octavo) (appeared 1794) plus 1 Volume of plates (i.e., atlas) (appeared 1795)). Alfred Jeremias acknowledged this books' contribution to the astronomical interpretation of mythology. Jeremias stated that Dupuis had published the 'masterwork' and Stucken and Winckler had made new/additional discoveries about such. Also see the much smaller book: The Ruins by Comte de Volney (1793). In Volney's view, the entire Gospel tradition represented an astral myth.
The development of the astronomical interpretation of mythology basically originated with scholars such as Max Müller (1823-1900) who developed the 'comparative mythology' method of investigation. Müller considered mythologies to be primitive rationalisations of celestial phenomena. In its extreme form, proponents reduced the content of all myths, legends, and even fairy-tales to the eternal contest the sun and night, and also interpreted biblical and early Christian narratives entirely in terms of solar mythology. Eduard Stucken is an example of this type of extreme proponent. Proponents of the 'Naturmythologie' theories drew from Indian writings such as the Rigveda. These texts were considered to be the oldest Indo-European sources. Later Indian commentaries on the Rigveda seemed to confirm that natural phenomena were the actual subjects of myths. This led to the situation where proponents of the 'Naturmythologie' theories felt confident regarding their efforts to retrace the original meanings of myths. Within this conceptual framework even if the myth does not directly mention natural phenomena the researcher assumed that natural phenomena were implied. Also in the early 19th-century some scholars tried to reconstruct the oldest Indo-European religion in a manner similar to that used at the time for the attempted reconstruction of a proto Indo-European language. amongst these early scholars were the Grimm brothers who concentrated on the Old Germanic heritage and employed the German folk tales current at the time, as well as the Edda. The German folk tales collected by the Grimm brothers were considered to be old Germanic myths reduced over time to folk tales. Later followers of the work of the Grimm brothers added the notion of the folk tales as always being remainders of 'Naturmythen.' They believed the knowledge of this had been lost by by the people who conveyed the folk tales. The assumption was that diligent researchers could recover the original meaning which was always nature-related. As example: A torn cloak actually is allegory/code meaning a break in the cloud cover. Obviously the data did not decide the interpretations; as it should. See the Introduction by Jørgen Prytz-Johansen (1911-1989, Danish scholar, historian of religion) to Handbuch der Religionsgeschichte by Jes Asmussen and Jøorgen Laessøe (3 Volumes, 1971-1972).
Beginning circa 1880 various academics and popular writers began to increasingly publish astronomical interpretations of mythology. (Astralmythologie (to use German term) interpreted religion, myth, and rituals almost exclusively in terms of astronomical events.) For example: Theogonie und Astronomie by Anton Krichenbauer (1881). Krichenbauer (1825-1884), a classical philologist, interpreted Homer's Iliad as an astronomical allegory. The sun-myth theory of Ignác Goldziher, Mythology Among the Hebrews and its Historical Development (1877), depended largely on etymologies and was discredited soon after its appearance. In 1892 the German folklorist Ernst Siecke (1846-1935) published his Liebesgesschichte des Himmels. The result of his numerous publications was that interest in star myths generally and the particular interest in Babylon had a mutual affect on each other and resulted in their combining together. (The pan-lunarisn of Siecke overemphasised the role of the moon in cultures.) Eduard Stucken (Astralmythen, 1896-1907) (at least initially) sought to explain all the mythologies of the world on the basis of supposed astral lore encrypted in Mesopotamian myths.
The astronomical method of interpretation of mythology applied by Eduard Stucken (and later adopted by the key Panbabylonists) was simply the restricted application/extension of the nature method of interpretation of mythology applied by such persons as Wilhelm Schwartz (Friedrich Leberecht Wilhelm Schwartz, 1821-1899). There was actually, however, limited astral interpretation within Stucken's Astralmythen. Suzanne Marchand (Down from Olympus (2003)) has described Stucken's Astralmythen as "bizarre." Also, the book was written in an iconoclastic manner. According to Stucken, Abraham is originally the constellation Orion, and Sarah is the star Sirius. Also, Abraham and Sarah are parallel figures to Osiris and Isis in Egyptian mythology. According to Stucken the accounts of Abraham go back to 2 Babylonian sources, the legend of Etana and Istar's Journey to the Underworld. Not a lot is known about what the Panababylonists believed about supposed coding methods and rules. According to Hertha von Dechend's predecessor Eduard Stucken there were formal formulas of astral mythology. In an article on Panbabylonism in The American Journal of Theology, Volume 12, 1908, it is explained that Stucken applied the 'astral' test to the myths of various people. It was believed by Stucken that mythology was converted into a formula for universal application. In the case of Israel this particularly constructed mythology was later demythologized and recast as Biblical historical figures.
Dupuis held to the unity of all ancient religions and the astral origin of all myths. This is substantially the point of view of Eduard Stucken. Stucken, unlike Dupuis, held that all myths diffused to the rest of the world from Babylonia. Any influence of Dupuis on Stucken has not been shown and likely Stucken's ideas were formed independently of his predecessor Dupuis even though broad common agreement exists. Stucken was the originator of the theory of Panbabylonism. The comparative mythographer Stucken was the first to claim that ancient Mesopotamia was the source of a tendency to personify and allegorise the movements of heavenly bodies as mythic projections of the activities of gods/goddesses and from Mesopotamia these mythic interpretations diffused throughout the ancient world as astral mythology and astral religion.
According to Panbabylonists myth originated from ancient Mesopotamian (Babylonian) attempts to articulate growing knowledge of the stars and planets (i.e., Babylonian astrology and astronomy). According to Panbabylonism the mythology of the whole world originated as a system of sun, moon, star, and skylore developed by the Babylonians circa 3000 BCE. Additionally the Panbabylonian school maintained there was a time when Babylonian astronomers circa 5000 BCE began the year with the constellation Gemini, after which came Taurus, followed by Aries, then Pisces.



Also represented more or less by Leo Frobenius, a sun-myth advocate, in his book Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes (1904); and by Ernst Siecke (sometimes (mistakenly) spelled Seiche) in the 'Panlunarism' of his Drachenkämpfe (1907). Within 'Panlunarism' the centre of all mythology was believed to be the moon. Representatives of this theory were Eduard Stucken, Georg Hüsing, Hugo Winckler, and Alfred Jeremias.
The excessive speculations of the 'Astralmythologie' school rejected any notions of independent or parallel developments of astronomical knowledge. It was simply assumed that all mythologies were based on astronomical events containing detailed but hidden information that spread throughout the world by cultural diffusion. (There is really no evidence that any Old Babylonian texts, astronomical or other, deliberately attempt to conceal their contents from outsiders.)
The ill-founded ideas of Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend still affect modern research into the origin of mythology. An example is the ideas of the academic David Pankenier into the basis for early Chinese mythology. Modern adherents to the Panbabylonism that is Hamlet's Mill who uncritically support its interpretations are obviously not familiar with the 19th-century/early 20th-century history of the interpretation of religion and mythology/folk tales. Outside of knowledge of this conceptual framework modern investigators - claiming knowledge and insight have proceeded to attach whatever interpretations to the data chosen for use.
Charles Dupuis in his Origine des tous les cultes: ou, Religion universelle proposed a common origin and unity of the astronomical and religious myths of ancient peoples. Among the numerous factors that enabled astralism/Astralmythologie to survive into the late 20th-century and present were (1) the abuse of comparative method, (2) the abuse of cross-cultural comparisons, and (3) the lack of contextualised evidence. Contextualised evidence is based on factors that address whether a strategy is useful, feasible to implement, and accepted by a particular community of scholars.
The 19th-century English 'school' of astronomical mythology
Adherents of astronomical mythology - no doubt influenced by Charles Dupuis - existed throughout 19th-century Great Britain. In the last quarter of the 19th-century key British proponents of astronomical mythology were Gerald Massey (1828-1907), Albert Churchward (1852-1925), John O'Neill (1837?-1895), James Hewitt (1835(6?)-1908), and George St. Clair (1836-1908). In the early 20th-century there was Emmeline Plunket (1834-1924).
The idea of zodiacal eras marked by the (shifting) location of the vernal equinox in a zodiacal constellation (i.e., zodiacal sign) was likely borrowed from the ideas of the French mythographer Charles Dupuis. As example, but only dating back circa 5000 BCE, is Creation Records Discovered in Egypt by George St. Clair (1898).
Panbabylonism
The central assumptions of the Panbabylonists were based on a comparative method. They saw in the myths of ancient cultures/civilisations world-wide traces of a prehistoric culture of an unknown location. Comparing the cultures/civilisations of the world, from Egypt to China, from prehistoric Europe to India, from Spain to North America, a common background in Near Eastern myths was claimed to be identified. The source and location of the prehistoric culture was claimed/named as Babylonia because Babylonia was identified as its oldest ‘witness.’ (See: Jeremias, 1913, Page 301.) According to the Panbabylonists this world-wide common mythology is based on knowledge of the sky. Winckler supposed that all mythology originated from the zodiacal scheme of constellations. Astrology was the expression of this knowledge and the foundation upon which astral mythology/religion is based. Winckler assumed that by the end of the 4th-millennium BCE an astral religion was well established in Mesopotamia. Panbabylonists such as Winckler and Jeremias held that the zodiacal scheme of constellations were established between 7000 BCE and 5000 BCE whilst the sun at the Vernal Equinox was between Cancer and Gemini. Both Winckler and Jeremias maintained that the Babylonians were aware of the precession of the equinoxes, an important basis for the structure of Babylonian astral mythology.
Part 18: Comparative Table
Hamlet's Mill can not be considered an original work - it is distinctly derivative. The claim for knowledge of the precession of the equinoxes being involved in the development of astronomical mythology goes back at least to (likely begins with) the 17th-century German Jesuit scholar and polymath Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680 in his book Oedipus Aegyptiacus (1653, 2 Volumes). For Charles Dupuis (1742-1809) in 18th-century France see the excellent summary (Chapter 2) in, The Theosophical Enlightenment by Joscelyn Godwin (1994). Some influence is owed to Max Müller who was perhaps the most influential 19th-century scholar in the study of comparative religion. The modern Jungian populariser of mythology, Joseph Campbell, believed in an early zodiac and early knowledge of precession. He claimed the zodiac was known by the 4thmillennium BCE and the precession was known by the 3rd-millennium BCE. Campbell gave no evidence for an early zodiac. Campbell's "evidence" for early knowledge of precession was simply his multiplication of 432 by 60 to get 25920 (the approximate length in solar years of the precessional cycle). See also: This is the Sun? by AlbertMcIlhenny (2012, Chapter 9 - The Zodiac, specifically Pages 130-131).

√ Ernst Siecke together with Eduard Stucken began the so-called 'star-myth' school which proposed astronomical interpretations of mythology. Ernst Siecke maintained that myths always referred to celestial phenomena, and especially to the changing character of the moon. Ernst Siecke advocated
√ The basis of all world myth originates from Babylonian observations of the movements of the sun, moon, and visible planets through the zodiac (systematised circa 3000 BCE). This view had its inception in Eduard Stucken's Astralmythen, which claimed as astral basis for all myths.
√ Strongly advocated the sun as the chief source of African and other mythologies. Purely solar interpretation of mythology. A return to the sun myth school of Max Müller.
√ All myths and epics have astral meanings. The common origin of all myths lies in the observation and explanation of stellar motions.



that all myths were originally lunar. Unexplored is what Eduard Stucken may have owed to Charles Dupuis, 1739.
2) Religion originally purely astral in character.
√
√ Eduard Stucken claimed an astral character for all myths.
√ According to Panbabylonism Babylonian religion was at first purely astral in character.
√
3) World-wide system of astronomical mythology (Neolithic period or Bronze age).
√ All similarities in myths are to be explained by diffusion/migration however far apart geographically.
√ All similarities in myths are to be explained by diffusion/migration however far apart geographically.
√ Held that all myths had an original allegorical reference to the sun. Also believed that parallel myths were the results of cultural exchanges between ancient peoples.
√ All similarities in myths are to be explained by diffusion/migration (from the Near East) however far apart geographically.
4) Concept of (astronomical) monomyth.
√√ √
√ Originally all myths handed down complex astronomical principles, in particular the precession of the equinoxes.
5) System originating in Neolithic period or earlier.
√ √ Advocated by Alfred
Jeremias. √
6) Hyper cultural
diffusion. √ √
√ According to Alfred Jeremias it was during the 'age of Taurus' that Babylon became the metropolis of the world. Alfred Jeremias strongly argued for the diffusion theory of myths.
√√
7) Diffusion from original cultural source (Neolithic period or Bronze age).
√
Diffusion/migration from Upper Egypt.
√ Eduard Stucken originally advocated diffusion/migration from Mesopotamia.
√ Diffusion/migration from Mesopotamia (in a simplified and distorted form). Elements are discernible even today in the myths of so-called 'primitive' peoples/tribes.
√
Diffusion/migration from various cultural/geographic sources (i.e., from Indonesia to Africa). Along with his student Adolf Jensen advocated diffusion across the Pacific. Believed there was a central mythproducing region that stretched from West Africa to India, and through Indonesia and Oceania to America.
√ In this tenet Hamlet's Mill follows Panbabylonism in that aspects of the Naturemyth school are joined/linked with the ideas of the GermanAustrian diffusionist school.
8) The myths of ancient cultures/civilisations world-wide show traces of an influential prehistoric culture of an unknown location.
√ √ The central assumptions of the Panbabylonists were based on a comparative method. They saw in the myths of ancient cultures/civilisations worldwide traces of a prehistoric culture of an unknown location. Comparing the cultures/civilisations of the world, from Egypt to China, from prehistoric Europe to India, from Spain to North America, a common background in Near Eastern myths was claimed to be identified. The source and location of the prehistoric culture was claimed/named as Babylonia because Babylonia was identified as
√ The myths of ancient cultures/civilisations world-wide show traces of an influential prehistoric culture of an unknown location. The identification of this prehistoric culture is not made but its location is placed in the Near East.



its oldest 'witness.' (See: Jeremias, 1913, Page 301.)
9) Early technical astronomy (Neolithic period or earlier).
√
√ Scientific origin of mythology in the ancient Near East.
√ Scientific origin of mythology in the ancient Near East particularly advocated by Alfred Jeremias. This system – held to be completely developed in Mesopotamia by 3000 BCE – was then diffused over the whole earth, being found even today in the myths of the 'primitives.' The Panbabylonists saw evidence of this diffusion in the astronomical knowledge they believe was implied in mythological systems (i.e., naturistic origin of myths). They argued that because such scientific observations were impossible for most archaic peoples the knowledge was obtained from elsewhere – a single source. Thus the Panbabylonists linked the naturistic origin of myths in Mesopotamia with their historical diffusion from Mesopotamia. Against opposing viewpoints on the origin of mythology, the Panbabylonists emphasised what they saw as the highly elevated, 'scientific' origin of mythology, and its diffusion even among the so-called most 'primitive' tribes.
√ Scientific origin of mythology in the ancient Near East. At least circa 5000 BCE an early Near Eastern civilization of unsuspected sophistication. Their system of astral mythology – held to be completely developed in Mesopotamia by at least 3000 BCE – was then diffused over the whole earth, being found even today in the myths of the 'primitives.' The authors of Hamlet's Mill saw
evidence of this diffusion in the astronomical knowledge they believe was implied in mythological systems (i.e., naturistic origin of
myths}. They argued that because such scientific observations were impossible for most archaic peoples the knowledge was obtained from elsewhere – a single source. Thus the authors of Hamlet's Mill linked the naturistic origin of myths in Mesopotamia with their historical diffusion from Mesopotamia. Against opposing viewpoints on the origin of mythology, the authors of Hamlet's Mill emphasised what they saw as the highly elevated, 'scientific' origin of mythology, and its diffusion even among the so-called most 'primitive' tribes.
10) Early zodiac (Neolithic period or earlier).
√ Placed the origin of the zodiac as far back as 15,000 BCE.
√ Both Hugo Winckler and Alfred Jeremias claimed the astral theory underpinning the 'Weltanschauung' ('view of the universe') originated in the 'Age of the Twins' (Gemini). Hugo Winkler dated such between 5,700 BCE and 2,500 BCE. Alfred Jeremias advocated origin circa 6th-millennium BCE. Alfred Jeremias claimed mythological motifs connecting the beginning of a new era with Gemini (Dioscuros myths) indicate that the zodiac was devised in the 'age of the Twins.' He further claimed a planisphere from the library of Assurbanipal [K 8538 (CT 33, 10)], based upon ancient calculations shows a graduation of the sun's course and marks for the zero point a point between the Bull and the Twins
√ At least circa 4000 BCE the establishment of a zodiac of 12 equal divisions. The zodiacal system described 'disasters' occurring cyclically after long intervals. (Santillana and Dechend 'picked up' the Panababylonist idea (likely from Jeremias) that the zodiac was in use at least several thousand years BCE.)



("Scorpion's Star, 70 degrees")." Alfred Jeremias concluded that the zodiacal division of the heavens - an equally divided 12constellation zodiac - was devised in the 'Age of Gemini' prior to the Sumerian civilisation beginning.
11) Air, land, and water constellation strata (per the constellations and the 12 zodiacal constellations).
√ Originated by Hugo Winckler and promoted by Alfred Jeremias.
√
12) Knowledge of precession (Neolithic period or earlier).
√
√ Advocated by Alfred Jeremias and Hugo Winckler. Babylonian mythological motifs describe the precession of the equinoxes.
√ Full knowledge of precession circa 5000 BCE. Incorporating knowledge of changes in pole stars. The myth of a heavenly mill rotating around the pole star and described as falling off its frame - and a new world order established - when a new star moves into the position of pole-star.
13) System of precessional worldages (Neolithic period or earlier).
√
√ A succession of zodiacal world ages was proposed by Eduard Stucken.
√ Advocated by Alfred Jeremias: "An oriental history without consideration of the worldera is unthinkable. The stars rule the changes of the times." According to the Panbabylonians precession was the basis of all Babylonian chronology and was ultimately connected with their political and religious reforms. The time it took to traverse each one of the 12 signs of the zodiac was a world-period, and its termination marked the beginning of a new era.
√ The secular (precessional) shifting of the sun through the divisions/signs of the zodiac determines worldages. (Alfred Jeremias lay special stress on zodiacal world ages. This idea was picked up by Santillana and Dechend underpins Hamlet's Mill and is emphasised as "World Ages.")
14) Mythology a coded technical language for astronomy/precession.
√ Eduard Stucken sought to explain all world mythologies on the basis of (supposed) astrallore coded (encrypted) in Mesopotamian mythology.
√ Understanding early Mesopotamian/Babylonian astronomy and religion is the cipher (code) for understanding the (secret) allegorical meaning of mythologies world-wide. Mythological motifs describe astronomical observations of the movement of the planets.
√ Understanding the movements of the visible planets through the zodiac and the effects of precession on the equinoxes and solstices is the cipher (code) for understanding the (secret) allegorical meaning of mythologies world-wide.
15) Precession forms the basis of mythology.
√ The precession of the equinoxes formed the substratum of a large part of Babylonian and classical mythology.
√ The precession of the equinoxes formed the substratum of all Babylonian and classical mythology.
16) Coded astronomical mythology circulated world-wide to chosen intellectual elite (intelligentsia) who understood meaning/were given decoding cipher.
√ Particularly promoted by Hugo Winckler with his proposal that a Babylonian intelligentsia held the idea of a single god and this was passed to the ancient Israelites by the patriarch Abraham (supposedly a Babylonian sage privy to knowledge held by a Babylonian intellectual elite).
√ Concept of a monomyth (relating to a millstone and a young protagonist) circulated from its origin in the ancient Near East to intellectual elites worldwide.
17) Coded √ In the first edition of √ The body of astral



astronomical mythology diffused around the world as 'secret lore.'
Handbuch der altorientalischen Geisteskultur by Alfred Jeremias (1913) he proposed that the body of astral myths claimed to begin in Babylon was diffused/passed to other civilizations/cultures as secret lore.
myths claimed to begin 'somewhere in the ancient Near East' was diffused/passed to other civilizations/cultures as secret lore.
18) There was a time when Near Eastern/Babylonian astronomers circa 5000 BCE began the year with the constellation Gemini, after which came Taurus, followed by Aries, then Pisces.
√ The Panbabylonian school maintained there was a time when Babylonian astronomers circa 5000 BCE began the year with the constellation Gemini, after which came Taurus, followed by Aries, then Pisces.
√ There was a time when unnamed Near Eastern astronomers circa 5000 BCE began the year with the constellation Gemini, after which came Taurus, followed by Aries, then Pisces.
19) Astrology is the last word of science in antiquity. There is no view of myth or legend or history to be taken without it.
√ Held at least by Alfred Jeremias. Astrology was the expression of scientific knowledge and the foundation upon which astral mythology/religion is based.
√ See especially Hamlet's Mill, page 345.Astrology has provided a continuing lingua franca and
astrology presupposed an astronomy. Note: In Babylonia 'astrology' preceded astronomy and was integrated with their religion. Also, Babylonian scientific astronomy was late. In Greece 'astrology' was adopted after their astronomy was established.
20) Importance of astrology, and astrology as ancient lingua franca.
√ In 1909 key Panbabylonists (including Alfred Jeremias) adopted new tactics and stated their intention to now only examine whether astrological foundations of Panbabylonism were better assured than its astronomical ones. Franz Kugler showed that Panbabylonism was just as unsound in its astrological as in its astronomical foundations.

Apparently forgotten is Die arische feuerlehre by Johannes Hertel (1925). Johannes Hertel. (1872-1955) was a German Sanskritist and Iranist who developed a theory of an early Indo-Iranian Weltanschauung based on a fire belief.
Panbabylonism and the nature-myth school did open up the field of comparative studies. The work that followed did not follow the methods of Max Müller, Adalbert Kuhn, Georg Hüsing, Eduard Stucken, etc. The Religion of the Semites by W[illiam] Robertson Smith (originally published 1889) is listed in the Bibliography of Hamlet's Mill (1969). The work of Smith (1845-1894) as well as those who follow anthropological methods has demonstrated that often terrestrial events form the foundation of ancient stories.
Basically the authors of Hamlet's Mill think that everyone is wrong but themselves and then bungle the burden of proof. They try to prove their ideas are correct - using outdated ideas of mythology and anthropology - instead of trying to find out whether their ideas are correct. Hamlet’s Mill attempts to revive the Victorian era interpretation of mythology. The 19th-century comparative mythologists - especially the German scholars were often involved in fantasies and extravagances. They attempted to prove too much and were strongly inclined to use unfounded suppositions. Grounding mythology in anthropology produced mixed results. It is clear from the MIT seminar notes that von Dechend believed she had the correct answer.
Part 20: Traditional Diffusionism versus Dynamic Cultural Interaction
Development of diffusionism
Gold, Daniel. (2003)."Explaining Together: The Excitement of Diffusionist Ideas." In: Gold, Daniel. Aesthetics and Analysis in Writing on Religion: Modern Fascinations: "This chapter traces the fate of some British and German diffusionist theories in the early twentieth century and reveals how explanatory hypotheses really can provide common grounds for working groups, even if these dissolve and become forgotten, as their hypotheses have been proven false. Diffusion theories appeared in the first few decades of the twentieth century, positing diversity among human cultures. Radical diffusionist projects were often promoted by just one or two people taken up with a daring new idea about the origin and spread of cultures. Championed by outspoken proponents able to arouse an initial exhilaration among a group of colleagues, these ideas have led to collaborative work that eventually petered out. In contrast to interpretive phenomenological visions, diffusionist explanations provided concrete programs of collective research. In the study of early cultures and civilizations at the turn of the twentieth century, diffusion vied with evolution as a concept that could explain the similarities found in the lifeways of diverse peoples."
Diffusionism attempts to understand culture in terms of the origin of culture traits and their spread from one society to another. Early versions of diffusionist thought included the conviction that all cultures originated from one culture centre (heliocentric diffusion); the view that cultures originated from a limited number of culture centres (culture circles); and the notion that each society is influenced by others but that the process of diffusion is both contingent and arbitrary. Diffusionist research originated in the middle of the 19th-century when some scholars attempted to



understand the nature of culture and whether it spread to the rest of the world from few or many innovation centres. Among the major questions was whether human culture had spread from innovation centres by diffusion.
The diffusionist approach was slowly replaced by studies concerning acculturation, patterns of culture, and the relation between culture and personality. By World War I, diffusionism was also being challenged by the newly emerging Functionalist school of thought lead by Bronislaw Malinowski (1884-1942; a Polish-born British-naturalized anthropologist) and Alfred [A. R.] Radcliffe-Brown (1881-1955; British anthropologist). They argued that even if one could produce evidence of imported aspects of culture in a society, the original culture trait might be so changed that it served a completely different function that the society from which it diffused. A more holistic approach, stemming from the play of diffusionism against evolutionism, has provided a more adequate understanding of the overall picture. In the 1920s, Franz Boas (1858-1942; German-American anthropologist and a pioneer of modern anthropology) and other American anthropologists, such as Robert Lowie (1883-1957; Austrian-born American anthropologist) and Ralph Linton (1893-1953; American cultural anthropologist), argued that cultural change had been influenced by many different sources. They argued against the attempted grand reconstruction of both evolutionists and diffusionists.
The German anthropologists tended to be extreme diffusionists. German and Austrian diffusionists argued that there were a number of culture centres, rather than just one, in the ancient world. Culture traits diffused, not as isolated elements, but as a whole culture complex, basically due to migration of individuals from one culture to another. Their school of thought was dominated by the Catholic clergy, who wanted to reconcile anthropological prehistory and cultural evolution with the Book of Genesis. The Kulturkreise (culture circle) school of thought, was proposed by Friedrich Ratzel, and the concept then widened by his student Leo Frobenius. This version formulated by Leo Frobenius in Vienna was called "culture circles" or Kulturkreise. This concept provided the criteria by which Fritz Graebner would study Oceania at first and two years later cultures on a world-wide basis. This influenced Fritz Graebner at the Berlin Ethnological Museum to write about Kulturkreise in his studies about Oceania, then on a world-wide scale. One of the best known leaders in this attempt was Wilhelm Schmidt, who had studied and written extensively on the relationships between religions of the world. Father Schmidt became a follower of Fritz Graebner, who was also working on a world-wide scale with "culture-circles." After becoming a follower of these ideas Wilhelm Schmidt created his version of the Kulturkriese, and began the journal, Anthropos (official journal of the Anthropos Institute; the journal's scope covers ethnology, linguistics and related human sciences). The "culture circle" concept proposed that a cluster of functionally-related culture traits specific to a historical time and geographical area diffused out of a region in which they evolved. Both Fritz Graebner and Wilhelm Schmidt claimed that they had been able to reconstruct a "limited number of original culture circles." Wilhelm Schmidt claimed to have discovered in the African Pygmy an Urkultur which, originating in Africa, had later spread to different parts of the world.
Diffusionism occurred in its most extreme form in the ideas of the British school of thought. William Rivers was the founder of these ideas. His studies were confined to Oceania, where he sought to explain the contrasts between Melanesian and Polynesian cultures by the spread of original complexes, which supposedly had been spread by successive waves of migrating people. He also applied this extreme concept of diffusionism to Australian burial practices. The leading proponent of this extreme diffusionist school was Grafton Elliot Smith. The diffusionist theory proposed by English scholar Grafton Elliot Smith was Egypt was the primary source for many other ancient civilizations. This form of diffusionism is known as heliocentric diffusionism. He claimed that Egypt was the source of culture and that every other major culture in the world was due to diffusion from Egypt, but that a dilution of this civilization occurred as it spread to increasingly greater distances.
Key figures include:
(1) Freidrich Ratzel (1844-1904) was a German anthropologist who was a significant contributor to 19th-century theories of diffusion and migration. Ratzel was the first to explicitly reject the idea of the ‘psychic unity of mankind’ as the explanation for cultural and social similarities. Ratzel argued that no culture had evolved in isolation, and that contact and borrowing between groups is far more common in human history than instances of social and cultural innovation. Ratzel explained similarities in human societies as a result of historical contact and cultural borrowing. He justified this position by arguing that humankind had limited capacities for invention and was inclined to attachment to traditions. Ratzel believed that the principal mechanism of diffusion was migration. He concluded that 'migration theory is the fundamental theory of world history.' Ratzel’s focus was the reconstruction of how cultural and social forms had spread from centers of innovation. This reconstructive effort was termed Kulturgeschichte (cultural history). He developed criteria by which the formal, non-functional characteristics of objects could be compared; based on the belief that it would be unlikely that these characteristics would have been simultaneously invented. See: Ratzel, Friedrich (1896 (A. J. Butler, translator); original German publication (1885-88) The History of Mankind.
(2) Leo Frobenius (1873-1938) was a German ethnologist and archaeologist, who was the originator of the concepts of the Kulturkreise (culture circles) and of the Paideuma (or "soul" of culture). He lacked formal academic qualifications and was criticized by scientists for his nonsystematic and rather romantic approach to anthropology. Frobenius was involved in extensive research in Africa, which was made possible by donors and by his own income from books and lectures. He left school without gaining any formal qualifications because his family moved constantly, and Frobenius did not attend school regularly. For this reason he could not satisfactorily take up his studies at a university but became an autodidact. His PhD thesis was rejected. Leo Frobenius, a pupil of Friedrich Ratzel, expanded on the "culture circle" concept. See: Frobenius, Leo (1898) Die Weltanschauung der Naturvolker.
(3) Fritz Graebner (1877-1934) was a German anthropologist, who was a leading diffusionist thinker. He was a cultural diffusionist. Graebner supported the school of "culture circles" (Kulturkreis), which could trace its beginning to Friedrich Ratzel, the founder of anthropogeography. The ideas of Leo Frobenius influenced Fritz Graebner, then at the Berlin Ethnological Museum (1904), to write about culture circles and culture strata in Oceania. Two years later, he applied these concepts to cultures on a world-wide basis. In 1911 he published Methode der Ethnologie in which he attempted to establish a criterion for identifying affinities and chronologies, called the Criterion of Form. See: Graebner, Fritz (1911) Methode der Ethnologie (also cited as Die Methode der Ethnology).
(4) William [W. H. R.] Rivers (1864-1922) was a British doctor and psychiatrist who became interested in ethnology after accompanying a Cambridge expedition to the Torres Straits in 1898. He later pursued research in India and Melanesia. Rivers was converted to diffusionism while writing his book, The History of Melanesian Society, and was the founder of the diffusionist trend in Britain. In 1911, He was the first to speak out again social evolutionism (later linked with independent invention). See: Rivers, W. H. R. (1922) History and Ethnology.
(5) Wilhelm Schmidt (1868-1954), born a German citizen but became an Austrian national, was a Catholic priest in Germany/Austria and an ethnologist who studied the religions of the world and wrote extensively on their inter-relationship (Barnard 1996:589). In the 1920s, 1930s and 1950s the Vienna culture-historical school was the dominant school of thought in Austrian academic ethnology. It was centred around Wilhelm Schmidt (1868-1954). Schmidt was a strict opponent of cultural evolutionism inspired by Darwinism and instead hypothesized a primordial culture characterised by monotheism, monogamy, and private property. In his endeavour to prove his theory of primordial monotheism (Urmonotheismus), he engaged other members of his religious (Societas Verbi Divini) to conduct fieldwork to gather ethnological evidence for his hypotheses. Peoples believed to be contemporary representatives of this Urkultur--those of short stature living in marginal areas, such as the Central African pygmy populations--became the central focus of research. Paul Schebesta (1887-1967) was one of the missionaries who conducted



intensive anthropological field research. He was the first to study the Malaysian Semang and then, in 1920-1930 and 1934-1935, the pygmies of the Ituri region. Schmidt's evolutionary theory of primeval monotheism or urmonotheismus has not found acceptance. At about the same time that Fritz Graebner (1906) was applying the culture-circle and culture-strata ideas on a worldwide scale, Father Schmidt help to promote these ideas, began the journal Anthropos, and created his own version of the Kulturkriese. Although both Fritz Graebner and Wilhelm Schmidt believed that all culture traits diffused out of a limited number of original culture circles, Father Schmidt's list of Kreise (culture circles) was the most influential. Schmidt was briefly imprisoned after Nazi Germany annexed Austria, but was released after the intervention of the Pope.
(6) Sir Grafton Elliot Smith (1871-1937) was a prominent British anatomist, and William [W. J.] Perry (1868-1949) (British geographer and anthropologist), a student of William Rivers, hypothesized that the entire cultural inventory of the world had, after the advent of navigation, diffused from Egypt. The development began in Egypt, according to them, about 6,000 years ago and was spread during Egyptian migrations by land and sea. See: Smith, Grafton Elliot (1928) In the Beginning: The Origin of Civilization; and Smith, Grafton Elliot (1933) The Diffusion of Culture. Unlike the Panbabylonists their fervent adherents were very few.
Hamlet's Mill and the Nature Myth School and Diffusionism
The roots of Panbabylonism are the early 19th-century debates on the origin of religions.
The early diffusionist model is adhered to in Hamlet's Mill. Hamlet's Mill reverts back to (1) the basic approach introduced by the founders of the "nature myth school" of the 19th-century, Aldabert Kuhn and Max Müller, that of philologically based comparative mythology, and (2) the basic method introduced by Eduard Stucken of defining myths by their motifs and comparing motifs between myths to claim parallels.
The importance of the natural world for northern European peoples made it likely that natural imagery was employed in their myths and reflected in the character of their dominant gods/goddesses. As examples: Zeus wielded a thunderbolt as his weapon, Thor's hammer-axe was a thunderweapon.
In his book review (The New York Review (of Books), February 12, 1970, Page 36) the anthropologist Edmund Leach writes: "Something like 60 percent of the text is made up of complex arguments about Indo-European etymologies which would have seemed old-fashioned as early as 1870. ... It was proposed by [Aldabert] Kuhn in 1852 that the name Prometheus is a corruption of Sanskrit Pra-mantha, a fire stick. Although this etymology has long ago been completely rejected as linguistically quite impossible ... Hamlet's Mill not only resurrects the equation but gives it enormous elaboration so that Prometheus's fall from celestial grace is made to provide evidence that our ancestors of 6000 years ago could recognize a shifting in the position of the Pole Star!" In his book review (Parabola, Volume III, Issue 1, 1978, Pages 113-115) the folklorist David Leeming writes: "... Hamlet's Mill reads like a parody of nineteenth century scholarship of the German variety."
According to the tenets of diffusion/Panbabylonism - and embodied in Hamlet's Mill - is the assumption the more 'developed' culture (i.e., ancient Babylonia) imposes its models (i.e., astronomical knowledge) on a passively receiving neighbouring culture, or neighbouring cultures - and likewise these recipient neighbours do the same - fundamentally because the receiving neighbouring culture have a 'blank slate' on the matter. This ignores the likelihood of a more active process of circulating ideas and constant and creative adaptation being the norm. It is now being realised that it is a trap to ignore the dynamics of cultural interaction and culture-specific mechanisms of adaptation.
Panbabylonian theory and Weltanschauung
According to the Panbabylonians such as Winckler and Jeremias, myth could not have developed an inherently consistent weltanschauung (which they believed they had identified in Babylonian religion/mythology) if it had originated solely from one or more such sources as primitive magical conceptions, dream lore, animistic beliefs, or other superstitions. They believed a weltanschauung could develop only from a specific concept which was the idea of the world as an ordered whole – and that this condition was fulfilled only in Babylonian astronomy and cosmogony. From Mesopotamia a weltanschauung and its attendant myth spread over the entire world, and found its biggest reception in Israel. For the Panbabylonians this particular historical orientation seemed to be a breakthrough which for the first time opened up the possibility of seeing myth not as a product of pure fantasy but rather as an intelligible and self-contained system. However, in the hands of the Panbabylonians, it was a form of a priori assertion (assumption) about the direction and aim of mythological research. The assumption that all myths were of astral origin, and that ultimately they are 'calendar myths,' was the core of the Panbabylonian method. For the Panbabylonists the astral explanation became the 'Ariadne's thread' (= the way of solving a problem with multiple apparent means of proceeding) which alone could offer a suitable pathway through the labyrinth of mythology. This general postulate was repeatedly called upon by the Panbabylonists to fill the gaps in empirical documentation and proof. The discoveries of archives at such places as Ugarit and Ebla, after the demise of Panbabylonism, would have provided the Panbabylonists with much needed 'ammunition.' However, these type of discoveries show it isn't all Ugarit/Ebla and it isn't all Babylonian.
Dynamic cultural interaction
Theory of cultural interaction
Common myth/cult pattern throughout regions of the world has led to various attempts at explanation. The 3 models for consideration are (1) cultural isolationism, (2) cultural diffusion, and (3) dynamic cultural interaction. (Vehicles of cultural transmission include: trade and commerce, migration, diplomacy, warfare, exiles, foreign employment, migration, and religious festivals.) The assumption that astral (and other) ideas travelled only in one direction is rather simplistic. According to the tenets of diffusion/Panbabylonism it is simply assumed that cultural traits naturally moved from more developed cultures to less developed cultures. The particular diffusionist theory of the Panbabylonists resulted in comparative similarities being held as evidence of borrowings by the younger culture from the older culture. The assumption is the more 'developed' culture (i.e., ancient Babylonia) imposed its models (i.e., astronomical knowledge) on a passively receiving neighbouring culture, or neighbouring cultures - and likewise these recipient neighbours do the same - fundamentally because the receiving neighbouring culture have a 'blank slate' on the matter. However, cultures throughout the ancient Near East cannot be regarded as primitive. Also, this ignores the likelihood of a more active process of circulating ideas and constant and creative adaptation being the norm. Today we know that all mythology is not astral mythology and all mythology did not come from Neolithic period Babylon. It is now being realised that it is a trap to ignore the dynamics of cultural interaction and culture-specific mechanisms of adaptation. A modern approach to the subject of cultural exchange in the ancient world is lucidly set out in When the Gods Were Born: Greek Cosmogonies and the Near East by the Spanish-born scholar Carolina Lopez-Ruiz (2010). The author bypasses traditional diffusionism in preference for a model of cultural exchange which encompasses an active process of circulating ideas and constant and creative adaptation.
"Carolina López-Ruiz's chapter explores the comparative approach of looking at the relation of Greek mythology to traditions in the Near East. The beginning of her chapter reviews previous scholarship and the issues that have characterized the difficulty in reconciling Greek and Near Eastern parallels. Recent scholarship shows how "comparison no doubt holds the key to many unopened doors" (159) and how the state of this field "tantalizes us with the possibility of an apparently inexhaustible line of research" (154). A section on "Methodological Considerations" offers



nine pitfalls that scholars should avoid in a comparative perspective. These range, for example, from warnings to avoid thinking of the "Near East" as a monolithic cultural entity to suggestions that we use terms like "adaptation," "appropriation," and "cultural transactions" rather than "simple borrowing" to describe such exchange between cultures (159-60). A final section offers an overview of genres, themes, and mythical figures that find parallels between the Greek and Near Eastern worlds, including discussions of Zeus and Aphrodite, connections between Homer's poems and the Epic of Gilgamesh, and relation between Greek cosmogony and the Hurro-Hittite Song of Release. López-Ruiz's suggestion that we can speak of a "mythological koine" or "international mythological language" from the Late Bronze Age [1570-1200 BCE] and later is sound and supports the approach of seeing Greek culture as part of, rather than separate from, the cultures of the Near East. This important chapter should become standard reading for anyone looking for a brief but sophisticated overview on this subject." (Book review by Anthony Mangieri (Salve Regina University) of: Lowell Edmunds, Approaches to Greek Myth. Second edition (2014); BMCR 2015.06.13 on the Bryn Mawr Classical Review blog.) See also the more critical book review by Johannes Haubold (Lecturer in Greek Literature at the University of Durham) in Aestimatio 8, 2011, Pages 136-141.
At least from the Bronze Age onward many diverse cultures shared a fund of standard, purpose composed mythic themes able to be drawn upon with modifications to suit. The northern Levant/Northwest Semites, specifically the Ugaritic and Phoenician cultures, are identifiable as important conduits for literary/cultural exchange within the Mediterranean region and the Near East. Jeffrey Cooper explains the (Mediterranean and West Asian) similarities in myths as the persistence of old Near Eastern patterns of myth into the syncretic world of the Hellenistic period.
Note: Certain passages in Irish myths are similar to passages in the Iliad. This is possibly plagiarism by monks. Irish monasteries/monks had access to a copy of Homer's Iliad and had translated it into Irish.
Theory of Paleolithic cultural convergence
Convergence in mythology/folklore where myths/tales from totally different sources appear almost identical may simply be due to similar lines of development. However, of interest is Introducing the Mythological Crescent: Ancient Beliefs and Imagery connecting Eurasia and Anatolia by
Harald Haarman and Joan Marler (2008). Using examples such as the 'Mother Goddess' and 'Bear Cult' the authors propose an interconnected zone of Paleolithic culture. According to the authors, in the Paleolithic era there was a culturally interconnected zone that reached from Western Europe to Eastern Siberia: "There was a broad cultural region with related traditions of mythical beliefs interconnected by longterm (sic) contacts during prehistoric times. This area - called here the "Mythological Crescent" - is a zone of cultural convergence that extends from the ancient Middle East via Anatolia to Southeastern Europe, opening into the wide cultural landscape of Eurasia."
Anther supporter of this type of idea was Mary LeCron Foster. Mary Foster (1914-2001) was an American anthropological linguist, who spent most of her working life at the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. She conducted graduate work in anthropology under the direction of Ruth Benedict. Her interests in symbolism and language origins were influenced by Franz Boas, whom she knew at Columbia. Foster published several articles purporting to reconstruct spoken Primordial Language (PL).
The wider question of Palaeolithic connections between Europe - in addition to Eurasia - and the American continent (as example: suggested by artifacts from the Kogruk site, Anaktuvuk Pass, Alaska) is not settled. The likely period for Palaeolithic Europeans to use the Bering Strait land bridge to cross into the American continent is the Wisconsin maximum (glacial period) circa 23000-19000 BCE. (See the 1963 publication on the Kogruk complex by the American archaeologist John Campbell. Campbell, John. (1963). "Ancient Alaska and Paleolithic Europe." (Anthropological Papers of the University of Alaska, Volume 10, Number 2, April 1963, Pages 29-49. (Note: Based on his work (tool discoveries) at the Kogruk site, Anakturvuk Pass, Alaska in 1956. John Campbell (1927-2013) was an archaeologist and faculty member of the University of New Mexico (rejoining 1964 until retirement).) See also: Human Population Genetics by John Relethford (2012).
Also of interest in this matter is: Sims, Lionel. (2013). "Toads and child sacrifice, moon and sun at Avebury and Stonehenge: using Greek myth to reconstruct the *IE substrate." In: XXI SEAC conference, Astronomy: Mother of Civilization and Guide to the Future. Book of abstracts. 1st September to 7th September 2013. (Pages 118-?). [Note: Lionel Sims is with the University of East London. (Retired Head of Anthropology at University of East London, Head of Anthropology at University of East London .) "Abstract: The main model in British archaeology for the Avebury and Stonehenge monument complexes is the materiality model of Mike Parker Pearson (2012). It argues that the meaning of the stone Stonehenge is revealed in the wooden Durrington Walls, linked to each other by river and Avenue. according to this model monuments of wood are for the living and monuments of stone for the dead. Elaborate ceremonies of ancestor worship begin with pig feasts at the wooden monuments that then culminate in the interment of the processed remains of the illustrious dead at stone monuments. It is claimed that this model also applies to the Avebury monuments. Monuments of wood and stone are anomalous to this model, which exist at Woodhenge in the stonehenge (sic) complex and the Sanctuary at Avebury – both of which combined wood and stone (Pitts 2001, Pollard 1992). This paper uses methods current within archaeology to reconstruct a prehistoric timber structure (North 1996), and archaeoastronomical method to test for alignments at these structures (Ruggles 1999). Recent research in linguistics (Pagel 2013) and molecular biology (Oppenheimer 2004) suggests that a Eurasian-wide substrate to myth must have existed in prehistory, much of it deriving from the Franco-Cantabrian refuge 15 thousand years ago (Stanford & Bradley 2012). [Note: The Basque territory has been regarded as the epicentre during the Last Glacial Maximum.] A further test for meaning is conducted drawing from Greek myth as one early and detailed local outcome from this *IE substrate. All three disciplines point to an alternative model of diacritical arrangements of materials and alignments intended to repair a cosmology perceived to be threatened with stasis."
Also: "Europe's southern rim of mountains and, along its eastern margin, the Carpathians formed the frontier between ice ages and sanctuaries [= warm pockets of land]. ... The peninsulas - Iberia, Italy, Greece,, and marginally, Turkey - were like holding pens into which the glacial surges drove species, with mountain ranges shutting the gates. Here they milled, mingled, and sifted themselves until a warming pried the gates open again, and they stormed out." (The Lost World by Lydia Pyne and Stephen Pyne (2012, Page 167).)

However, there is no evidence of an international Paleolithic astronomy. How many patterns of thought (if any) achieved commonality in the Paleolithic period geographic/cultural block comprising the Near East, Mediterranean, and Europe is unknown. Certainly common themes in mythology were shared throughout this geographic/cultural block during the Late Bronze Age.
From page 390: 14. Symbolism: the foundation of culture by Mary LeCron Foster in: Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology edited by Tim Ingold (1994, republished 2002).
Excursus: George Moore (History of Religions, 1947) pointed out that in general, the overall influence of Assyrian religion diminished in proportion in proportion to (1) the distance of Assyrian conquests from the Assyrian homeland, and (2) the length of time of its subjugation of



other territories/regions. Also, even in the geographically closest territories/regions the local traditional religions maintained greater importance and influence.
Bronze Age community integration
Kristian Kristiansen (Danish archaeologist and a professor at the University of Gothenburg) has developed an understanding of the Bronze Age world of Eurasia as a geographically integrated system of communities that was held together by the exchange of materials, the movements of traders and warriors, and by shared concepts of world order. There was large scale nobility during the Bronze Age involving large regional
movements of peoples and materials. For example see: The Rise of Bronze Age Society. Travels, Transmissions and Transformations by Kristian Kristiansen and Thomas Larsson (2005).
Prehistoric voyaging
Recently published: Travelling Prehistoric Seas: Critical Thinking on Ancient Transoceanic Voyages by Alice Kehoe (2016, but also given as 2015). Publisher's blurb: "Until recently the theory that people could have traversed large expanses of ocean in prehistoric times was considered pseudoscience. But recent discoveries in places as disparate as Australia, Labrador, Crete, California, and Chile open the possibility that ancient oceans were highways, not barriers, and that ancient people possessed the means and motives to traverse them. In this brief, thought-provoking, but controversial book Alice Kehoe considers the existing evidence in her reassessment of ancient sailing. Her book-critically analyzes the growing body of evidence on prehistoric sailing to help scholars and students evaluate a highly controversial hypothesis; examines evidence from archaeology, anthropology, botany, art, mythology, linguistics, maritime technology, architecture, paleopathology, and other disciplines;-presents her evidence in student-accessible language to allow instructors to use this work for teaching critical thinking skills." Mostly a citation of archaeological evidence for prehistoric sailing voyages. Though the term prehistoric appears in the title the emphasis is on the data regarding preColumbia transoceanic contacts of peoples worldwide. The author assesses the possibilities, plausibilities and probabilities of a selection of betterattested-to contacts. One chapter discusses technical aspects of sailing with prehistoric technologies.
Alice Kehoe (born 11934) is emeritus professor of anthropology at Marquette University and Honorary Fellow at University of WisconsinMilwaukee. She is specialist on Native America, the history of archaeology, and archaeology of gender. She has authored numerous articles and over a dozen books on those topics. She has frequently examined numerous debates/controversial topics in her fields, such as the role of shamanism and the authenticity of the Kensington Runestone.
Part 21: A Modern Argument for Evidence of Knowledge of Precession Before Hipparchus
There is no discussion of precession and calendrical problems caused by it by Greek astronomers before Hipparchus.
In his 2009 paper, "The Knowledge of the Aequinoctial Precession Before Hipparchus," (Articolo in corso di stampa sugli Atti del IX Convegno Annuale della Società Italiana di Archeoastronomia "Cursus Caelestium Siderum" tentenutosi a Firenze, Dipartimento di Astronomia di Arcetri, dal 14 al16 settembre 2009) Mario Codebò discusses 6 'evidences' as clues. These are: (1) the (so-called) Foroughi Cup (actually a bronze bowl, once part of the Mohssen Foroughi collection in Teheran comprising Iranian artifacts from the 2nd-millennium BCE to the late 18th-century CE, now in the Shlomo Moussaieff collection in London); (2) the 4Q318 brontologion; (3) the Biblical date of the creation of the world; (4) the date of the main Biblical events; and (5) the 2 Babylonian zodiacs; and (6) Mithraic symbols. At the conclusion of his arguments the author states the evidence is offered as clues, but not (decisive) proofs. (See: http://www.archaeoastronomy.it/The_knowledge.htm)
The bronze bowl referred to by Mario Codebò as the 'Foroughi cup' is unprovenanced but believed to have every likelihood of being genuine, because the complexity of the interior astral design would have taken a long time to prepare. The first published discussion of this inscribed astral bronze bowl (18 cm in diameter and 3.5 cm high), apparently from Luristan (western Iran) or ancient Syria, engraved with a sophisticated astral scene (sun, moon, various stars, and constellations), was first discussed in print by the British archaeologist R. D. Barnett in 1966. The bowl is believed to be manufactured by an Aramaic craftsman during the first half of the 1st-millennium BCE. It is believed to be of Syrian or Phoenician craftmanship due to its similarity to Phoenician copper/bronze bowls of the 8th-7th centuries BCE. Also the 7 tiny Aramaic labels (text) can be dated paleographically and this adds to the evidence in favour of its authenticity. The 7 engraved inscriptions are typical of Aramaic culture for the 6th-7th centuries BCE. The cup reproduces a starry sky with some recognizable constellations and heavenly bodies. The interior of the bowl is completely filled with an astral scene composed of central motifs surrounded by 8 zones. Depicted are constellations, the sun, and the moon, but it is perhaps not intended as a sky map. (See: "La *Coppa Foroughi : un atlante celeste del 1. millennio a. C." by Maria Giulia, Amadasi Guzzo, and Vittorio Castellani. (Rivista italiana di archeoastronomia : astronomia nell'antichità, astronomia storica, astronomia e cultura, 2006, Number 4, Pages 1-8). See the discussion in: The Journal of the Ancient Near Eastern Society of Columbia University, Volume 5, 1973. Also, Younger, Jr., K[?]. (2012). "Another look at an Aramaic Astral Bowl." (Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Volume 71, Number 2, October, Pages 209-230).)
This remarkable bronze bowl gives us a star map of the heavens (or similar construct), that is unique in our surviving material from antiquity. It is also remarkable in illustrating what appears to be a mostly non-Mesopotamian, most probably Iranian, astronomical scheme. It reproduces a starry sky with some recognizable constellations and heavenly bodies (the sun, the moon, perhaps the visible planets). It is also claimed by some persons that comets are depicted. Placed amongst two large (rayed) stars and two constellations shaped as a pair of hunting boots is the starry figure of a hunter-god armed with spear (in his right hand) standing on an ibex. The figure seems to represent the constellation Orion (as a hero), the Babylonian Papsukkal, standing on SUHUR.MASU (the Sumerian goat-fish) or Caper [Caper-bush?]. To his right is (apparently) the Plough and the Pleiades (as '7 dots'). (Note, however, it has been commented that the dots appear to be linked by parallel vertical lines and may have had a different meaning altogether i.e., that of a stylized palmette.) To his left is a bull's head, made of stars, presumably the constellation Taurus; below it is a kind of starry ankh sign, possibly Corona Borealis or Coma Berenices, while above it is a tailed monkey surrounded by twelve stars. The name and relevance of the monkey is unknown. This intriguing symbolism, associating the monkey with the hunter (though in an astronomical depiction), may possibly be relevant to a terracotta plaque of the Old Babylonian period. The two Bears (Ursa Major and Ursa Minor), are respectively positioned at 2 opposite sides of the center in the cup. Interestingly, there are 4 figures (constellations) placed at the tips of a cross, 2 of them appear to represent Taurus and Leo; the 3rd one seems to be Scorpio and the 4th one can no longer be identified (but speculated as Aquarius) because of an additional engraving placed on it.
Monkeys have a long and quite respectable history in the ancient Near East. Monkeys were pets in Egypt and most likely also in Mesopotamia from early times. The idea of animals acting like humans is found in Mesopotamian art and perhaps came to Sumer, along with the monkey, from India. India was the classic home of the animal fable. A well-known terracotta plaque of the Old Babylonian period shows a quite remarkable scene in which a hunter is shooting an arrow at a monkey in a tree. There is a kneeling man behind the hunter who seems to be restraining him. Also, in the scene a boar is approaching the tree. We may have here a depiction of a now lost animal fable. The 12th/13th-century CE Persian poet Nizami's/Nezami's story of Bahram Gur, the famous hero hunter of the onager (wild asses native to the deserts of Syria, Iran, Pakistan, India, Israel, and Tibet) which once thrived in Iran and Syria, was based on a real historical figure, Bahram V, a Sasanian king (reigned 420–438 CE).



Its use as an argument for pre-Hipparchan precessional knowledge is that the bronze bowl is the first graphic representation of a past sky configuration in which the effects of the precession are shown. It is claimed the astral depiction does not show the sky configuation at the time it was made (1st-millennium BCE) but instead the astronomical situation existing in the 4th/3rd millennium BCE when the spring equinox was in Taurus, the summer solstice in Leo, the autumn aequinox in Scorpio and the winter solstice in Aquarius. The fatal flaw with this speculation is that it relies on the assumption of an ancient evenly divided 12-constellation zodiac before its clearly documented invention by the Babylonians in the 1st-millennium BCE.
Temple alignment
If ancient observers were aware of the effects of precession they did not know what it was or how to calculate it. It is argued that with ancient temple orientation (or standing stones), to whatever direction, there is slight adjustment when a new temple is built on the site of an old one. A solstice alignment could only be used for approximately 1000 years, the amount of time it would take to no longer get a valid observation. (This argument is used for sites at Gezer and Golan Heights in the Levant.) Günter Martiny did a lot of work on Babylonian temple orientationregarding precessional adjustments. His proofs, first set out in his 34-page Die Kultrichtung in Mesopotamia (1932), remain controversial. See the (Germanlanguage) book reviews in ZA, NF Band 8 (Band 42), 1934, Pages 198-217.
Part 22: The Origin of Astronomy
Brian Hayden on "Secret Societies and the Origins of Astronomy." Brian Hayden is an Honorary Research Associate in the Department of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia and a professor emeritus of archaeology at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia. His publications are well worth reading. Brian Hayden states: "The origins of detailed astronomical observations and modelling of celestial movements is obscure at best and often associated with early elite attempts to predict the future... I think complex astronomy began in some locations in the Upper Palaeolithic among complex hunter/gatherers located in resource rich areas."
Part 23: Further Reading
The claim that myths originated from scientific astronomy is not a new one. The German star-myth school and the German Panbabylonism school had developed the idea in detail. Hamlet's Mill is a dated and vague (enigmatic) exploration of the believed connection between world mythology and the origin/early history of scientific thought. The theme of Hamlet's Mill remains appealing to the imagination and will undoubtedly continue to influence the production of books and articles of debatable worth. Hamlet's Mill remains successful in promoting the deluded speculations of its authors.
