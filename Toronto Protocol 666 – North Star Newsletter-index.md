Toronto Protocol 666
by Michael Knight | Aug 5, 2020 | Blog | 1 comment
This article is in part a memorial to Serge Monast, a French Canadian who in 1995
exposed the detailed plans of a group of powerful individuals intent on creating
their New World Order.
It is especially useful as background information if one wishes to more fully
understand why the Q movement was started, and what the Q team and
President Trump are up against.
Personally, I am certain that the advent of the Q community and the associated “Great
Awakening” as it is termed, is perhaps the only thing that will stop what is revealed here
from coming to fruition....the Globalist/Deep State plan to establish a New World Order,
especially by stealthily taking over the United States.
The new paperback, “Qanon And The Great Awakening,”
written with contributions by Martin Geddes in the UK, is
highly recommended as additional information about the
Q movement involving millions of people in the United
States and other countries.
Over time I will also be making a series of YouTube videos based on this content, but I
believe it is vitally important to have the full text available for Qanon researchers

because it explains very clearly what the Deep State has been plotting.
To be frank, it is a copy and paste (with added images and links to current supporting
sources) from the weebly.talkiforum, in full, where we nd that Serge Monast, a French
Canadian from Toronto, a poet, artist and investigative journalist, “died of a heart
attack” (which means he was assassinated) after being arrested (once again) and held in
jail for 24 hours.
He died a few hours after his release.
What follows is what was posted on that forum by an individual named Rick
Matheson on June 15 2013 with the question “A leak of the real plan of the
Globalist Elite?”
He wrote:
Read and decide for yourself!
This is a translation from the French of a document compiled by a clique of senior
nanciers who met in Canada in 1967 and then in 1985. Its a pretty explosive paper
which documents a far reaching conspiracy to set up a global government by means of
corrupting the people and nances of nation states, and much else besides. I think its
extremely interesting but there is no doubt that most people will shake their heads in
wonder that a group like this could really exist.
It comes to us via an investigative journalist in Canada
called Serge Monast (1945-1996), who died a year after
releasing this document from a heart attack su ered
in suspicious circumstances only a day after he was
released from jail. He was quite a well known and
respected gure whom you can see give a lecture in
French in the image above and on video here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-hn4OiJKSA .
We are told that he had various sources from which he
got his information:
It is true that it was informed by repented politicians, and disgusted Secret Service
agents. He also received classi ed, ultra con dential, documents, often anonymously or
transmitted by fellow-members [of] located at the four corners of the world.
It has also been said that this particular document originated from French intelligence.
(Monast was from French speaking Canada.)
In any case this really is a remarkable account and Monast himself concluded that it is
up to each individual reader to make their own mind up on whether to believe this
document, by, he recommends, seeing if it matches the politics, and recent political
history, of the last few years.

Bush
The document begins with these few introductory remarks added by Serge Monast
when he released it rst in March 1995: (Incidentally this is, as far as I know, the rst
time this document has been translated into English, but the current writer holds no
claim to being a great French scholar so in the event of any dispute you should consult
the original French text which is available at various places on the net, including
here: http://www.onnouscachetout.com/forum/topic/13116-protocole-de-toronto/
(Expect a 404 Page Not Found – MK).
“End of June 1967: in Montreal there is Expo 67; in Ottawa, there are the nal
preparations for the “Centenary of the Confederation”; in the U.S. it is the challenge of
the Vietnam War and, through the country, the “Flower Power”. We are close to the
events of May ’68 in France, the explosion of nationalism in Quebec, the Woodstock
Festival in the U.S. ... but at the same time, the end of June 1967 marks the nal
preparations for the development of the Plan of the “Fall of Nations” by the highest
levels of Anglo-Saxon Freemasonry in Toronto (Canada).
This secret meeting, highly “Con dential”, is organized by the “6.6.6”, (so they call
themselves), i.e. those who run the 6 largest banks in the world, the 6 largest energy
consortia on the planet (including the oil part), and the 6 largest consortia of agri-food
(which includes the control of the principal routes in the food world [“principales]).
These 6.6.6., being the most senior international nanciers, will de ne, within their
meeting, a “Common Strategy” for absolute control over “World Trade”; on the
possession of the Energy Weapon (the gateway of the twenty- rst century [“porte]); and
the international control of the food (which also includes, for them, the pharmaceutical
companies which include, in turn, the global market for “Vitamins” and “vaccines”).
Their “plan” boils down to three major
themes: “The Economic, the Political,
and the Social Policy for the 70s and
80s. If successful, it must inevitably
lead to the capture of “Global Power”
by implementing the “New World
Order “, the same which U.S. President
George Bush will do much to promote
in the early 90s.
The Title of the Document of the 6.6.6.: “PANEM and circuses” (From Bread and Circus
Games)
The Goal of the Globalist Project: The “Genocide of the Vital for the Bene t and Pro t
of the Occult. [“Génocide]”
Means of Financing the Project: Among other things, use of Humanitarian Aid, and of
Food Aid International to nance the “Multinationals” of the 6.6.6.
THE DOCUMENT:

All historical periods that led to the decline of
civilizations were all marked, without
exception, by “the spirit of errancy of men”.
Today, we must ensure that that “Spirit” will
result from a “World Society of Leisure” in all its
forms.
This “Leisure” should consist of [Sex,], [drugs],
[Sport], the [Exotic] and [Entertainment] in
general, but accessible to all strata of society.
Man must come to believe that it is “Modern”,
and that modernity consists of its present
capacity and, possibility, to enjoy greatly
everything that surrounds it.
To achieve this objective it is imperative to be
able to in ltrate the Media (Radio, TV,
Newspapers), the milieu of the “Mode” and
“Culture” (the milieu of the New Music) by which we will in uence, for sure, all sections
of Western societies.
So taking under our thumb the “Sense” of young people (the adults of tomorrow), we
will therefore open the way to in ltrate and transform profoundly, without arousing
suspicion, Politics, the Legal System and Education, which will allow us to fundamentally
change the course, the future direction of, Society envisaged by our “Plan”.
The people we know, have not historical memory. They tirelessly repeat the mistakes of
the past without realizing that these errors had led their fathers before them into the
same descent as they will live in, only worse, before the end of this century. See, for
example, how their grandfathers have lived at the beginning of this century, thanks to
the hard work of our predecessors.
Having known, without limits, the release of morals, and the abolition of morality (in
other words, the errancy of the spirit), they experienced the “Economic Crisis” and the
“War.”
Today their grandchildren and their children are heading towards a similar conclusion,
even worse, because this time we will nally establish our “New World Order” and none
of them are capable of realizing it, they will all be too preoccupied in meeting their
overly sensual needs, the very basic.
A “Norm” generally very important, which has already proven itself at the beginning of
this century in the construction and the establishment of the [Communist] by the late
Senior o cers of our Lodges, is the pro tability of the “Exception”. In principle, we know
that, the exception proves the general rule is contrary to it. But in our vocabulary, the
Exception is what must be imposed on all. We need to make “Exceptions” in di erent
spheres of society, the new “Rules” generally applicable to all, a primary objective of all
future social protests led by the Youth of Nations.

Karl Marx
Thus the Exception will be the detonator by which all the historical society will
collapse on itself in shortness of breath and unprecedented confusion.
The foundation of “Western Society”, in
essence, comes straight from the Judeo
Christian heritage. Precisely the same legacy
that made the “Family”, the “Node”, and the
“Cornerstone” of all the current social
structure.
Our predecessors who had nanced the
revolutionary writers of the late nineteenth
century and early twentieth century had
understood the importance of splitting, then to
break, this “vital core” if they wanted in Russia to achieve the new “Communist system”
of the time.
And that is precisely what they did by carefully producing by philosophers and writers,
nonconformists of the time,: “A Manifesto for the glory of the God-state [the]”; which
has the absolute primacy over the individual, over the “Family”.
To succeed with certainty to the construction of a World Government, [A] where all
individuals without exception, will be subject to the “World State” of the “New Order”,
we must, rst, remove the “Family” (which will, in turn, lead to the loss of ancestral
religious teachings), and secondly, leveling all individuals by removing the “Social
Classes”, in particular, the “Middle Classes”.
But we must proceed so that all these are seen as being from the popular will,
that they have the appearance of “Democracy”.
Using isolated cases, but amplifying them to the extreme using student protests
in ltrated by us, journalists sympathetic to our cause and purchased politicians, we will
be able to establish new bodies that have every appearance of “Modernity”, such as an
“O ce for the Protection of Children”, protected by a “Charter of Rights and Freedoms”.
For the success of our “Global Plan: [The]”, we
need to implement in all societies of the West
in the 70s, an “O ce for Protection of Children”
where sta (young intellectuals with no
experience, fresh out of universities which
highlighted our internationalist principles) will
follow to the letter, without discernment, the
“Charter of the Rights of the Child.”
Who would dare oppose it without at the same
time being labelled as barbarians from the
Middle Ages?



2020. 10. 29. Toronto Protocol 666 - North Star Newsletter
https://northstarnewsletter.com/toronto-protocol-666/ 6/22
Ed. Note:- A simple Internet search on “child protection services” will yield results showing
that such “services” have been established world-wide. Just one example:– Childprotection/
Minnesota Department of Human Services https://mn.gov/dhs/people-we
serve/children-and-families/services/child-protection/ Child protection Minnesota has
various programs to help children who may not be in safe environments. County and tribal
child protection workers work with families to prevent child maltreatment or, in some case,
work with the courts and law enforcement to remove children from the home if they are in
harm’s way.
In the “Charter”, laboriously developed in our “Lodges”, we will nally wipe out any
parental authority by breaking the family into people ercely opposed to each other to
protect their interests. It will encourage children to report parents who are too
authoritarian as being too traditional, too religious. It will thus contribute to subject
parents to a “Collective Psychosis of Fear”; this will inevitably give rise, generally in
society, to a relaxation of parental authority.
Thus we will have succeeded, initially, to produce a society like that of Russia in
the 50s where children denounced their parents to the state, and this without
anyone noticing.
In thus transferring to the State the “Parental Role”, it will be easier, then, for us to grab,
one by one, all the responsibilities that had been, to date, the sole responsibility of the
parents. So that we can have it considered by all as an abuse against the child, religious
instruction of traditional Judeo-Christian origin.
At the same time but at another level, we will include in the highest Laws of Nations,
that all Religions, Cults and religious Practices of all kinds, including “Sorcery and Magic”,
must all be met in the same way as each other.
It will be pro table later to transfer the role of
the State in relation to the child to the highest
international bodies, such as the United
Nations.
(Ed Note:- The United Nations has since
implemented much of this protocol via their
conventions “on the rights of the child.” e.g.
http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-convention/ )
Understand this well: “Our goal is not to protect children, or anyone from another,
but to cause the collapse and subsequent fall of Nations which are a major
obstacle to the implementation of our “New World Order.”
That is why the “O ce of Child Protection” must be invested with absolute legal
authority. They must be able, as they see t, but always under the pretext of protecting
the child, to remove them from their original home environments and place them in



2020. 10. 29. Toronto Protocol 666 - North Star Newsletter
https://northstarnewsletter.com/toronto-protocol-666/ 7/22
family backgrounds or foreign government centres that have been established for our
internationalist principles and religions.
Therefore, it will complete the nal breaking of the “Western Family Unit”. For without
the protection and monitoring of their original parents, these children will be
permanently handicapped in their psychological and moral development, and
consequently represent natural prey, easily adaptable to our global aspirations.
For success to be achieved by such an enterprise, it is essential that sta working in
these ‘O ces” in the service of the state, are young people without experience, imbued
with theories that we know are empty and ine ectual, and especially, are obsessed with
the missionary spirit as great protectors of children at risk. For them, all parents must
represent potential criminals, potential hazards to the welfare of the child, here
considered a “God.”
An “O ce of Child Protection” and a “Charter of the Rights of the Child” have no reason
to be without children at risk [i.e.]. In addition, exceptions and the historical examples
used in their [i.e.] creation would sooner or later disappear if they were not constantly
fed with new cases occurring on an ongoing basis.
In this sense, we must in ltrate the “Education System” of Nations to make disappear,
under the cover of “Modernity” and “Evolution”, the teaching of Religion, of History, and
Good Manners, while diluting at the same time, under an avalanche of new
experiments in the milieu of Education, that of language and mathematics.
In this way, by depriving the younger generations any grounding in and any frontier to
morals, any knowledge of the past (and therefore any national pride), all respect for
others, power through knowledge of language and science (and thus of the reality), we
will help build a youth largely prepared for all forms of delinquency.
In this new world fragmented by fear of parents, and their abandonment of any
responsibility for their children, we will open the way to train in our own way and
according to our primary objectives, a youth where arrogance, contempt, and
humiliation of others, will be considered as the new basis of “A rmation of Self” and
“Freedom.”
But we know, from similar past
experiences, that such a youth is already
doomed to its own destruction because it is
inherently “individualist”, so “Anarchist” by
de nition. In this sense, it cannot possibly
represent a solid basis for the continuity of
any society whatsoever, much less a safe
bet for the care of its elderly.
In the same vein, it is equally imperative to create a “Charter of Rights and Individual
Freedoms” and “O ce of the Protection of the Citizen” with the promise to the masses



2020. 10. 29. Toronto Protocol 666 - North Star Newsletter
https://northstarnewsletter.com/toronto-protocol-666/ 8/22
that these innovations are part and parcel of “Modernity” and of the “New Society” of
the twentieth century.
Similarly, at the same time, but at another level, to pass new laws for the “Respect of
Individual Liberty”. As in the case of the “Family”, but under the plan for the “Society”,
these laws will con ict with the Rights of the Community, leading for the societies
involved, their right to self-destruction. For here, the reversal is complete: “It’s not the
society (the right of the majority) to be protected against people who may threaten, but
rather (the Right of the Individual) which is to be protected against potential threats
from the majority.” That’s the goal we set ourselves.
To complete the breakup of the family, and of
the education system, therefore the Society in
general, it is essential to encourage “Sexual
Freedom” at all levels of Western Society. We
must reduce the individual, and so the masses,
to an obsession with satisfying their primary
instincts by all possible means. We know that
this step represents the culmination by which
any society will collapse on itself. Was it not so when the Roman Empire [fell] from its
apogee, like all civilizations throughout history?
By men of science and laboratories funded by our Lodges, we were able to develop a
chemical process that will revolutionize all Western Societies, and relegate to oblivion
forever, moral principles and the Judeo-Christian religion. This process, in pill form, will
open the door wide to “Sexual Freedom” without consequences, and push the “Women”
of Nations to want to break with what will be seen as the yoke of the past (the slavery,
women subject to men and the traditional Judeo-Christian family).
Formerly the “Centre and pivot of the family unit,” the modern woman, now as an
independent, wants to break with its traditional role, separate from the family and live
her life according to her own personal aspirations. Nothing more natural, we know, but
where we will intervene strongly [is] in ltrating all new “Women’s Movements”, and
accordingly push their logic to its extreme limits. And these limits are already written
down as the nal breakdown of the traditional family and Judeo-Christian Society.
This “Sexual Liberation” is the ultimate means by which we will be able to get rid out
of the “Conscience of the People” a reference to “Good and Evil”. The collapse of the
moral and religious barriers will allow us to complete the process of the false
“Liberation of Man from his Past”, but which in reality is a form of slavery that will
bene t our “Globalist Plans”.
The door opened for the
encouragement of “sexual Liberty”, to
“Divorce”, to “Abortion” on demand, to
various forms of legal recognition of



2020. 10. 29. Toronto Protocol 666 - North Star Newsletter
https://northstarnewsletter.com/toronto-protocol-666/ 9/22
homosexuality, will help us to
fundamentally alter the historical basis
of the “Legal Rights” of Societies. It will
be a major push on all individuals
towards a general loosening of morals,
to divide people against each other,
according to their instincts and their
own interests, to destroy the future of
the youth, pushing for damaging
experiences of early sexuality and abortion, and to break the morality of future
generations by pushing them to alcoholism, drugs of any kind (with respect to which
our Senior O cers of the International Lodges will take care to take over the world) and
suicide (the latter considered by disenchanted youths, abandoned and left to
themselves, as a chivalrous end).
Lets disappoint the Nation’s youth by showing them to their parents as irresponsible,
irreligious, immoral, not ambitious, giving themselves over to pleasure, escape, and
unbridled satisfaction of their instincts, at the cost of lies, hypocrisy and betrayal. Let’s
make divorce and abortion socially acceptable. Let’s push it and crime in all its forms,
and then they will take refuge in separate groups, out of reach of the home
environment, which will change, inevitably, because of the threat to its survival. The
social fabric is disrupted and forever, we will then be able to act on the Politics and
Economy of Nations, to submit them to our mercy, and they will come to accept by
force, our plans for a New Order World.
For, it must be confessed, that Nations which cannot count on a strong youth, a society
where individuals are grouped around a common ideal, reinforced with walls of
unwavering morals, which, historically, would have been able to provide support, can
not abdicate our global commitment.
So then we can inaugurate what was announced by both our past creations: “The
communist system who prophesied a world revolution set in motion by all the rejects of
the earth”, and “Nazism in which we had announced a New World Order for 1000
years”. That is our ultimate goal, the award of the work of all the brave fallen for the
performance of this work over the centuries. Say it loud and clear: “All the Brothers of
the past Lodges, who died in anonymity for the realization of this ideal that we are now
able to touch with the tips of our ngers.”
It is generally acknowledged that Man, once having secured his basic needs (food,
clothing and shelter), is much more likely to be less vigilant. Let us allow him to lull his
conscience, while we direct our own thing in his mind [“tout], by creating favourable
economic conditions. So, during this period of the 70s where our agents will slip across
the di erent spheres of Society to accept our new standards in Education, Legal Rights,
and Social Policy, we will spread it around in a con dent economic climate.

https://northstarnewsletter.com/toronto-protocol-666/ 10/22
Work for all; the opening of Credit for all;
Recreation for all, will work tandem to create
an illusion of a new social class: the “Middle
Class”. Because once we have achieved our
goals, this “class” in the middle, between the
secular poor, and us rich, will de nitely
disappear by cutting o all means of survival.
In this sense, we will make the Nation-States
the new “Parents” of individuals. Through this
climate of con dence, which our “International
Agents” will act to reinforce by removing any spectre of world war, we will promote the
“Centralization” to the death for the State. In this way, individuals can gain the
impression of complete freedom to explore while the legendary burden of personal
responsibility will be transferred to the State.
Thus it will be possible to increase dramatically the burden on the State by multiplying,
without any limits, the mass of intellectual-functionaries [employed]. Insured, for years
in advance, with material security, they are therefore perfect performers of the
“Governmental Authority”, in other words, our “Power.”
(Ed Note:- “As the keystone of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the SES [Senior Executive
Service) was established to ...ensure that the executive management of the Government of
the United States is responsive to the needs, policies, and goals of the Nation and otherwise is
of the highest quality.” Source: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior-executive
service/ Members of the SES apparently cannot be red. Therefore they are in a perfect
position to act as the Shadow Government or Deep State.)
Creating an impressive mass of public servants who, alone, will form a Government in
the government, regardless of which political party will be in power. This machine can
anonymously one day serve as a lever, when the time comes, to accelerate the
economic collapse of nation states, because they can not inde nitely sustain such a
payroll without having to incur debts beyond their means.
On the other hand, this same machine that will give an image of cold and unresponsive
government; this complex machine, useless in many of its functions, will serve as a
cover and protection against the people. For who will dare to venture through the
mazes of this labyrinth to assert his personal grievances?
Also during this period of general daze, we will also undertake to buy or eliminate,
according to the needs of the moment, all business leaders, heads of major state
agencies, and the Centres for Scienti c Research, whose work and e ciency might give
too much power to the Nation-States. It is imperative that the State does not become
an independent force in itself, that might escape and endanger our ancestral “Plans”.
We will also have an absolute control over all the supranational structures of Nations.
These international Bodies should be under our exclusive jurisdiction.



2020. 10. 29. Toronto Protocol 666 - North Star Newsletter
https://northstarnewsletter.com/toronto-protocol-666/ 11/22
In the same sense, and to ensure the
bene t of our in uence with the
people, we will control all the media
information. Our banks will therefore
nance only those we favour, while
they oversee the closure of the most
recalcitrant. This is expected to pass
almost unnoticed by the people, who
will be absorbed by their need to make
more money, and by the
entertainment.
We must take care to complete, now, the phased dérégionalisation [sic,] of rural areas
began at the start of the “Economic Crisis” of 1929. Overcrowd the cities, like during the
“Industrial Revolution”. The landowners, with their economic independence, and their
ability to produce the staple food of the States, are a threat to us, and our future plans.
Piled up in cities they are more dependent on our industry to survive.
We cannot allow the existence of independent groups from our “Power.” So eliminate
landowners by making them slaves to obedient Industries under our control. In regard
to the others, we will allow them to organize into Agricultural Cooperatives which our
agents will in ltrate to help guide them towards our future priorities.
Using the State, let us highlight the “Respect” due to the, mandatorially diverse,
“Cultures”, and to the “People”, “Religion”, and “Ethnicities”, which are ways for us to put
the concept of “Personal Freedom” before the concept of “National Unity”, which will
allow us to better divide the populations of Nation States, and thus weaken their
authority and their ability to manoeuvre. Taken to extreme limits, but within the
international plan, this concept, in the future, will push the ethnic groups of di erent
nations to come together to claim individually its own share of “Power”, which will
complete the ruin of nations, and will burst into endless wars.
Then the Nation States will be weakened with many battles, all based on the
recognition of the “Rights of Minorities” to their independence, the nationalists
will be divided into di erent cultural and religious factions, opposing [each]
blindly in struggles without end, and our youth will have completely lost touch
with his roots. So we can then use the UN to begin to impose our New World
Order.
Besides, at that stage, the “Humanitarian Ideals, Social and Historical” of the Nation
states, will have long since expired under the pressure of internal divisions.
(End of Document 6.6.6. dated at the end of June 1967.)
[At this point the document from 1967 ends and the one from 1985 begins, as noted
here by Serge Monast:

“Eighteen years later, (6.6.6.) in time [meaning], another Reunion of importance was
held in Canada. The Group 6.6.6. met again in Toronto, in late June 1985, but this time
to nalize the remaining steps that should lead to the collapse of Nation States, and the
seizure of International Power through the United Nations.”
DOCUMENT TITLE — “THE RED DAWN”
The Purpose of the Globalist Project:
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OCCULT WORLD
(Ed Note:- This was the beginning of the
Computer Age. IBM had introduced the rst home
computer in 1981).
The Means of Financing the Project: Control of
the IMF, GATT, the Commission of Brussels, of
NATO, of the UN and other International
Organizations.
The last eighteen years were very pro table for
the advancement of our global projects. I can
tell you, Brothers, we are now touching it, almost there. The fall of Nation-States is only
a matter of time, and that rather short, I can tell you with con dence.
With our undercover agents and our colossal nancial resources, unprecedented
progress has now been made in all areas of Science and Technology, which we control
[through] the largest nancial corporations.
From the secret meetings with Mr. de Rotchild in year 56, and who had intended to
nalize the development and global implementation of the “Computer”, it is now
possible to envisage the establishment of a kind of “International Highway” where all
these machines are interconnected.
For as you know, direct control of individual people on the planet would be at
least totally impossible without the use of computers and their link electronically
with respect to each other in a huge “Network World”.
These machines also have the advantage in being able to replace millions of people.
Moreover, they have neither conscience nor any moral, which is essential for the
success of a project like ours.
Above all, these machines do, without question, everything that is dictated to them.
They are the perfect slaves that have been dreamed by our predecessors, they who
were able to suspect that one day it would be possible to accomplish such a prodigy.
These machines without a country, no colour, no religion, no political a liation and
achievement, are the ultimate tool for our New World Order. They are the
“Cornerstone”!



2020. 10. 29. Toronto Protocol 666 - North Star Newsletter
https://northstarnewsletter.com/toronto-protocol-666/ 13/22
The organization of these machines into a vast “Network World”, which we will control
the levers of, we use to immobilize people. How?
(Ed Note:- “Coincidentally” the DARPA Lifelog project, which was a military endeavor to track
everybody’s presence down to the meta level was canceled the same day – February 4 2004
that Facebook went public. And if you believe Facebook was created by a few students in a
dorm, you need to rethink that cover story
As you know, the basic structure of our New World Order is composed, in essence, of a
multitude of “Networks”, each covering all di erent spheres of human activity over the
whole of the planet. Until now, all these “Networks” were linked together by a common
ideological basis: that of man as the “Centre” and “Ultimate Achievement” of the
Universe.
So thanks to all these “Networks”, united by the bond of the “New Religion of Man to
Man”, we have easily in ltrated all human sectors in all Western countries, and changed
their “Judeo-Christian” basis. The result is that today, this Man, he is part of the Politics,
the Economy, the Social, Education, and the Science of Religion, and has already, since
our last meeting at the end of June 67, abandoned his past heritage and replaced it with
our ideal of a World Religion based solely on Man.
Having cut as well as possible its historical roots, this Man is waiting, nally, to be
o ered a new ideology. This, properly understood, is ours, that of the “Global Village
Community”, which will be the “Centre”.

And that is precisely what we will give him, encouraging him to take part, “Body and
Soul”, in this “Global Electronic Network” where the borders of nation-states have been
forever abolished, wiped out up to their deepest roots.
While this lost man will be absorbed by its blind enthusiasm to be part of its new
“Global Community”, by being part of this vast “Network of Computers”, for our part, we
shall see, from the levers above, which will be hidden in the le, and be able to identify,
to recognize, the rewards of our own goals.
Because within this “New Global Society”, any individual with a potential “Pro tability”
for us, cannot escape. The constant in ux of “Electronic Technology” will make sure all
the means to le, identify, and monitor all individuals in populations of the West. For
those who do not represent “Exploitable Pro tability” by ourselves, we will ensure they
are eliminated through all the local civil wars that we have taken care to break out here
and there through: the work of our servants; and the “Fall of the Economy” of the
Nation-States; and the “Oppositions and Claims” of various groups within those states.
Here is the detail with which we will by 1998 be able to pave the way for the birth
of our “World Government”:
1. – Expand the “Leisure Society” which
has been so pro table to date. By using
the invention of the “Video” that we’ve
funded, and games attached to it, end
up perverting the morals of youth.
O er him the opportunity now to
satisfy all his instincts. A being
possessed by his senses, and slave of
these, we know, will have neither ideal nor the inner strength to defend anything. It is
an “individualist” in nature, and is a perfect candidate which we can easily shape to our
desires and our priorities. Besides, remember how easily our predecessors were able to
turn all German youth at the beginning of the century using the disillusionment of the
latter!



2020. 10. 29. Toronto Protocol 666 - North Star Newsletter
https://northstarnewsletter.com/toronto-protocol-666/ 15/22
2. – Encourage “Student Causes” for all cases related to the “Ecology”. The mandatory
protection of the latter will be a major asset on the day we will have pushed the Nation
States to exchange their “Domestic Debt” for a loss of 33% of all their territories
remaining in the wild.
3. – Let us ll the inner void of that
youth by initiating, from a very young
age, the world of computers. Use this
as its education system. A slave in the
service of another slave we control.
4. – On another level, establish
“International Free Trade” as a priority
for the economic survival of the Nation
States. This new conception will help us
accelerate the economic decline of the “Nationalists” of all nations, to isolate the various
factions, and in due course, to ercely oppose each other in wars that will complete the
ruin of these nations.
5. – To ensure at all costs the success of
such an endeavour, let us ensure that
our agents, who have in ltrated the
Ministries of Intergovernmental A airs
and Immigration of the Nation-States,
make major changes to the Statutes of
these ministries. These changes will
essentially open the doors of
immigration to Western countries with
a large mass of immigrants entering across their frontiers (immigration that we have
indeed caused by having taken care to break out here and there, new localised
con icts). Through well-orchestrated press campaigns targeting public opinion in the
Nation-States, we provoke them to accept a large in ux of refugees which will have the
e ect of destabilizing the domestic economy, and increasing racial tensions, in their
territory. We will ensure that groups of foreign extremists are part of the in ux of
immigrants, which will facilitate the political, economic, and social, destabilization of the
Nations concerned.
6. – With “Free Trade”, which in reality is not free because it is already controlled
by us at the top of the economic hierarchy, in ltrated by the”Trilateral
Commission” [that], we will bring discord within the Nation-States by rising
unemployment related to restructuring of our Multinationals.
7. – Slowly but surely we will move our
multinationals into new countries with
the idea of a “Market Economy”, such



2020. 10. 29. Toronto Protocol 666 - North Star Newsletter
https://northstarnewsletter.com/toronto-protocol-666/ 16/22
as the countries of Eastern Europe,
Russia and China, for example. We do
not much care, for the moment, if their
population has or has not a large pool
of new consumers. What interests us,
primarily, is to have access to the “Slave
Labour” (cheap and non-union) that we
o er these countries and the Third
World. Moreover, are their
governments not put in place by us? Do they not call for foreign aid and loans from our
“International Monetary Fund” and our “World Bank”? Such transfers o er many
advantages for us. They help to maintain these new populations in the illusion of an
“Economic Liberation”, and a “Political Liberty” when in reality we shall prevail over their
desire for gain with a debt they can never hope to pay. As for Western populations, they
will be maintained in the dream of [Economic] because products imported from these
countries will not su er any price increase. But on the contrary, without them noticing
at rst, more and more industries will be forced to close their doors because of the
transfers [of] we have made out of Western countries. These closures will increase
unemployment and bring signi cant losses of revenue for the Nation-States.
8. – So we will develop a worldwide “Global Economy” which will completely escape the
control of Nation-States. Above all in this new economy, no political or union pressure
may have power over her. It will dictate its own “Global Issues” and will require a
reorganization of politics, but according to our priorities worldwide.
9. – With this “Economic Independence”, having as laws only our laws, we will establish a
“Culture of Mass Globalism”. By controlling international Television, and Media, we will
institute a “New Culture”, but levelled, uniform for all, without any future “Creation”
escaping us. Artists will re ect our future image or will not survive. No more this time
will “Independent Cultural Creations” at any time put in jeopardy our globalist projects,
as was so often the case in the past.
10. – By the same economy [“Par], we
will then be able to make use of the
military forces of nation states (such as
those in the U.S.) in humanitarian aims.
In reality, these “forces” we will use to
submit recalcitrant countries to our
will. Thus the Third World, and others
like them, will not be able to escape our
willingness to use their people as slave
labour.
11. – To control the world market, we will divert the productivity of its rst goal (to free
man from the hardness of work). We shall orientate it to turn it against man by



2020. 10. 29. Toronto Protocol 666 - North Star Newsletter
https://northstarnewsletter.com/toronto-protocol-666/ 17/22
enslaving this last to our economic system where he will have no choice but to become
our slave, or become a criminal.
12. – All these transfers abroad of our multinationals, and reorganizing the global
economy, will aim, inter alia, to drive up unemployment in Western countries. This
situation will be more feasible because at the beginning we favoured the massive
importation of commodities within the Nation-States, and at the same time, we have
overloaded those States by overuse of their population in the production of services
they cannot pay. These extreme conditions will be multiplied by the millions on welfare
bodies of all kinds, illiterate, homeless. etc.
13. – With the loss of millions of jobs in the primary sector; caused by the same
disguised escape of foreign capital out of the Nation-States, it will be possible to
develop the death of social harmony with the spectre of civil war.
14. – The international manipulations of governments and peoples of the Nation
States will give us the excuse to use our IMF to push Western governments to
implement “Austerity Budgets”, under the cover of a reduction of their illusory “National
Debt” and the retaining of their hypothetical “International Credit Rating” and the
preservation of the impossible “Social Peace”.
15. – Using those “Budgetary Emergency Budgetary Measures”, we will break the
nancing of the Nation-States for all their “Mega-Projects” which represent a direct
threat to our global control of the economy.
16. – Besides all these austerity measures will allow us to break the national will in
modern structures in the areas of Energy, Agriculture, Transport and New Technologies.
17. – These same measures will give us the perfect opportunity to introduce our
“Ideology of Economic Competition”. This will mean, within the Nation-States, through
the voluntary reduction of wages, the voluntary departure with [the], which will open
the door to the installation of our “Technology Control”. At this time, all departures will
be replaced by “Computers” in our service.
18. – These social changes will help us
to fundamentally change the workforce
and the “Police and Military” of the
Nation-States. Without arousing
suspicion, under the pretext of the
necessity of time, we will get rid once
and for all of all individuals with a
“Judeo-Christian Conscience.” In this
“Restructuring of the Police Corps and
the Military” we will dismiss without
challenge the older sta , as well as all elements not carrying forward our globalist
principles. These will be replaced by young recruits, lacking “Conscience and Morality”,



2020. 10. 29. Toronto Protocol 666 - North Star Newsletter
https://northstarnewsletter.com/toronto-protocol-666/ 18/22
and already all trained, and supporting the reckless use of our “Technology of
Networked Electronics”.
19. – At the same time, and always under the pretext of “budget cuts”, we will ensure
the transfer of military bases of the Nation-States to the United Nations.
20. – To this end, we will work for the
reorganization of the “International
Mandate of the UN”. From “Peace
Force” with no decision making power,
we shall raise them to become an
“Intervention Force” which will, in a
while, render the military forces of the
Nation-States homogenous. This will
allow us to, without ghting, achieve
the demilitarisation of all these states
so that none of them in the future are su ciently strong (independent) to challenge our
“World Power”.
21. – To accelerate the transfer process, we will involve the current strength of the
United Nations in intractable con icts. In this way, and with the help of the media that
we control, we’ll show people the impotence and uselessness of this “Force” in its
current form. Frustration helping, and pushed to its climax at the right time, it will push
the people of Nation-States to beg international bodies to form such a “Multi-National
Force” at the earliest opportunity, to protect at all costs the “Peace”.
22 . – The emergence of the next global commitment to a “Multi-National Military Force”
will go hand in hand with the establishment, within the United Nations, of an “Multi
Jurisdictional Intervention Force”. Using this combination of “E ective Police and
Military”, created by the same pretext of increasing political and social instability within
these states collapsing under the burden of economic problems, we can better control
the western populations. Here, the excessive use of electronic ling and
identi cation of individuals will provide a complete monitoring of all populations.
23. – The reorganization of police and military, internal and external, of the Nation
States will converge on the obligation of all to the establishment of a “World Centre of
Judiciary”. The “Centre” will allow the individual “Police Corps of Nation-States”
prompt access to “Databases” on all individuals potentially dangerous to us on
the planet. The image of [striving] better judicial e ciency, and more close links
created and maintained with the “Military”, will help us highlight the need for an
“International Tribunal” coupled with a “Global Justice System”, one for civil a airs and
criminals, and another for Nations.
24. – During the growing acceptance by all of these new requirements, it will be
imperative for us to earlier complete the global control of rearms within the
territories of the Nation-States. To do this, we will accelerate the “ALPHA PLAN”
implemented during the 60s by some of our predecessors. This “Plan” originally had two



2020. 10. 29. Toronto Protocol 666 - North Star Newsletter
https://northstarnewsletter.com/toronto-protocol-666/ 19/22
objectives which have remained the same today: – through the intervention of “crazy
shooters” creating a climate of insecurity in people to get them to [support] tighter
control of rearms.
– orient violence so as to put the blame on religious extremists, or people with religious
a liations who tend to the “Traditional” or, of persons claiming to have privileged
communications with God.
Today, to accelerate the “Control of Firearms,” we can use the
“Collapse of Economic Conditions” of the Nation-States which
will take with it a complete destabilization of the Social [fabric],
so increasing violence. I needn’t need to remind you or show
you, Brothers, the foundations of this “Control” of rearms.
Without it, it would become almost impossible for us to make
kneel down the populations of those targeted States.
Remember how well our predecessors were able to control
Germany in 1930 with the new “laws” implemented at the
time, laws which are now the foundation of the current laws of
Nation-States for the same control.
25. – These “Steps” refer to the “OMEGA
PHASE” experienced from experiments
conducted in the early 70s. They
contain the application, globally, of
“Electro-Magnetic Weapons.” The
“Changes of Climate” has caused the:
– destruction of crops, and failure,
under these conditions, of agricultural land;
– denaturation, by arti cial means, of food products of common consumption;



2020. 10. 29. Toronto Protocol 666 - North Star Newsletter
https://northstarnewsletter.com/toronto-protocol-666/ 20/22
– the poisoning of nature by an excessive, indiscriminate and widespread use of
chemicals in agriculture;
and all this, Brothers, this will lead to certain ruin the food industries of the Nation
States. The future of “Population Control” of these states must go [hand] with the
absolute control by us of food production globally, and by taking control of the main
“Food Routes” [“Routes] in the world. For this, it is necessary to use the Electro
Magnetic, among others, to destabilize the climates of the States most productive
agriculturally. As to the poisoning of nature, it will be speeded up all the more as the
increase of populations will push it without restriction.
26. – The use of the Electro-Magnetic will cause “Earthquakes” in the most important
industrial regions of the Nation-States, to help speed up the “Economic Collapse” of
States most threatening to us; as well to amplify the obligation of the establishment of
our New World Order.
(Ed Note:- HAARP: Secret Weapon Used For Weather Modi cation ...
ttps://www.globalresearch.ca/haarp-secret-weapon-used-for-weather-modi cation
electromagnetic-warfare/20407 Oct 14, 2018 Though denied by HAARP o cials, some
respected researchers allege that secret electromagnetic warfare capabilities of HAARP are

the year 2020. Others go so far as to claim that HAARP can and has been used for weather
modi cation, to cause earthquakes and tsunamis, to disrupt global communications
systems, and more).
27. – Who could have suspected the use of these means? Those who dare against us by
disseminating information about the existence and content of our “conspiracy”, will
become suspect in the eyes of the authorities of their nation and their people. Thanks
to the misinformation, lies, hypocrisy, and individualism, that we have created among
the people of the Nation-States, this Man will become an enemy for humans. Thus
these “Independent Individuals”, who are more dangerous to us precisely because of
their “Freedom”, will be considered by their peers as enemies, not liberators.
Child slavery, the pillaging of the Third World, unemployment, propaganda for the
liberalisation of anti-drug laws, the brutalization of the youth of Nations, the ideology of
“Respect for Individual Freedom” di used in Judeo-Christian Churches and within the
Nation-States, obscurantism considered as a basis of pride, inter-ethnic con icts, and
our latest achievement: “Budget cuts”; with all that, we can nally see the performance
of our ancestral “Dream”: the introduction of our “NEW WORLD ORDER”.
End of Document of the End of June 1985.
CONCLUSION
So, the “PROTOCOL OF TORONTO (6.6.6.)”, myth or reality?
It would be like asking if “The Brave New World” is also a myth or reality even if it is a
novel. For its author also had access to “Documents” of the period to create it. Its author
knew that the disclosure, the dissemination of information that he possessed, in a



2020. 10. 29. Toronto Protocol 666 - North Star Newsletter
https://northstarnewsletter.com/toronto-protocol-666/ 21/22
di erent form than the novel, would have awakened in people a lot more distrust than
acceptance. And how many other authors had used the same ploy to warn their
contemporaries and future generations?
So, the “PROTOCOL OF TORONTO (6.6.6.)”, myth or reality?
The urgency of the actual situation, that generated by the start of the “Budgetary
Limitations” which marks the beginning of the end, close to the realisation of the “Occult
New World Order”, allows not the writing of a novel (which would have taken too much
time in the present context).
But the impact caused by the revelation of the “Documents” is still important because
when they are published it will e ectively put on the defensive those who are behind
them.
What is desired, here, is that beyond the misinformation conveyed, and maintained by
unscrupulous politicians and by people frightened about the possibility of losing self
interest, each reader can re ect, together with others like him, and now take means to
survive in the face of what comes.
Even though my life is in danger because of the dissemination of this information to
you, yours is even more so due to your ignorance of the same information.
So, the “PROTOCOL OF TORONTO (6.6.6.)”, myth or reality?
It is for you to answer ...
For you to see in the recent past and future events, if these “documents” belong to the
realm of ction or reality.
For you to realize that fear has no other purpose than to paralyse you and put you to
thank those who want to control you, to better enslave you according to their interests,
which are ultimately, not yours.
So, the “PROTOCOL OF TORONTO (6.6.6.)”, myth or reality?

I rst heard about this in the early 90s and thought it was crazy. Now...
not so much.
Thank you for all your works!
