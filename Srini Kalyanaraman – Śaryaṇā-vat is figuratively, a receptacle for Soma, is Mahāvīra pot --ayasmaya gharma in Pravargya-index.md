metaphors of horse-head of दध्यच् dadhyac and restored head of makha in Pravargya Soma Yajna to convey the madhuvidyā of (dhātu)mākṣika a kind of h°-like mineral substance or pyrites.

Wilson translation: 6.047.18 Indra, the prototype, has assumed various forms, and such is his form as that which (he adopts) for his manifestation; Indra, multiform by his illusion, proceeds (to his many worshippers), for the horses, yoked to his car are a thousand. [Indra has assumed: Indra presents himself as Agni, Vis.n.u, or Rudra, or any other deity who is the actual object of worship, and is really the deity tobe adored; he is identifiable with each;

Horses yoked: Indra's chariots and horses are multiplied according to the forms in which he manifests himself; Indra is here identified with Parames'vara, the supreme first cause, identical with creation]. 6.047.19 Yoking his horses to his car, Tvas.t.a_ shines in many places here in the three worlds; who (else), sojourning daily among his present worshippers, is their proector against adversaries? [In this r.ca,Tvas.t.a_ is an appellative of Indra, the ancient artificer!].
I submit that the veneration of the horse by people of Scytho-Siberian lands, archaeologically attested, is related to the veneration of the role of twin divinities aśvin m. du. (inā or inau) ‘the two charioteers’, N. of two divinities (who appear in the sky before the dawn in a golden carriage drawn by horses or birds; they bring treasures to men and avert misfortune and sickness; they are considered as the physicians of heaven), RV.

Reflexes in other Indo-European mythologies include the Lithuanian Ašvieniai, the Latvian Dieva Dēli, the Greek Castor and Pollux; and possibly the English Hengist and Horsa, and the Welsh Bran and Manawydan. The first mention of the Nasatya twins is from the Mitanni documents of the second millennium BCE, where they are invoked in a treaty between Suppiluliuma and Shattiwaza, respectively kings of the Hittites and the Mitanni." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashvins
"This is actually a common sight on barn roofs in the traditionally agrarian areas of Germany, though mostly in the northern half of the country...While Anglo-Saxon legends will refer to these crossed horse-headed staves as Hengist and Horsa, its much earlier Teutonic meanings are only a vague memory in German mythology." http://europagans.blogspot.com/2013/10/architectural-traditions-horse-stave.html
At the archaeological site Potapovka ca. 2500 BCE (N. Krasnoyarsk Dst., near Kuybyshev on the N. Volga steppe), a unique burial has been found. Head of a human skeleton has been replaced by a horse head; a human head lies near his feet, along with a bone pipe, and a cow's head is placed near his knees. (Source: Vasil'ev, I.B.,P. F.

Makha (मख) refers to a “sacrifice”, as mentioned in the Śivapurāṇa 2.2.27. Accordingly as Brahmā narrated to Nārada:—“[...] when the sage Dadhīci and others staged a walkout, the evil-minded Dakṣa, inimical to Śiva, said mocking at them.:—‘[...] They are slow-witted and senseless. They are rogues indulging in false deliberations and discussions. They are out of the Vedic circle. These men of evil conduct shall be eschewed from sacrificial rites (makhakarman)’”. https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/makha
Kanda XIV, adhyaya 1, brahmana 1 1.The gods Agni, Indra, Soma, Makha, Viṣṇu, and the Viśve Devāḥ, except the two Aśvins, performed a sacrificial session. 2. Their place of divine worship was Kurukṣetra.. Therefore people say that Kurukṣetra is the gods’ place of divine worship: hence wherever in Kurukṣetra one settles there one thinks, 'This is a place for divine worship;' for it was the gods’ place of divine worship.
3. They entered upon the session[2] thinking, 'May we attain excellence! may we become glorious! may we become eaters of food!' And in like manner do these (men) now enter upon the sacrificial session thinking, 'May we attain excellence! may we become glorious! may we become eaters of food!'
4. They spake, 'Whoever of us, through austerity, fervour, faith, sacrifice, and oblations, shall first compass the end of the sacrifice, he shall be the most excellent of us, and shall then be in common to us all.' 'So be it,' they said.
5. Viṣṇu first attained it, and he became the most excellent of the gods; whence people say, 'Viṣṇu is the most excellent of the gods.'
6. Now he who is this Viṣṇu is the sacrifice; and he who is this sacrifice is yonder Āditya (the sun). But, indeed, Viṣṇu was unable to control that (love of) glory of his; and so even now not every one can control that (love of) glory of his.
7. Taking his bow, together with three arrows, he stepped forth. He stood, resting his head on the end of the bow. Not daring to attack him, the gods sat themselves down all around him.
8. Then the ants said--these ants (vamrī), doubtless, were that (kind called) 'upadīkā[3]'--'What would ye give to him who should gnaw the bowstring?'--'We would give him the (constant) enjoyment of food, and he would find water even in the desert: so we would give him every enjoyment of food.'--'So be it,' they said.
9. Having gone nigh unto him, they gnawed his bowstring. When it was cut, the ends of the bow, springing asunder, cut off Viṣṇu's head.
10. It fell with (the sound) 'ghṛṅ'; and on falling it became yonder sun. And the rest (of the body) lay stretched out (with the top part) towards the east. And inasmuch as it fell with (the sound) 'ghṛṅ,' therefrom the Gharma[4] (was called); and inasmuch as he was stretched out (pra-vṛj,), therefrom the Pravargya (took its name).
11. The gods spake, 'Verily, our great hero (mahān viraḥ) has fallen:' therefrom the Mahāvīra pot (was named). And the vital sap which flowed from him they wiped up (sam-mṛj) with their hands, whence the Samrāj[5].
12. The gods rushed forward to him, even as those eager to secure some gain (will do)[6]. Indra reached him first. He applied himself to him limb after limb, and encompassed him[7],



5
and, in encompassing him, he became (possessed of) that glory of his. And, verily, he who knows this becomes (possessed of) that glory which Indra is (possessed of).
13. And Makha (sacrifice), indeed, is the same as Viṣṇu: hence Indra became Makhavat (possessed of makha), since Makhavat is he who is mystically called Maghavat[8], for the gods love the mystic.
14. They gave to those ants the enjoyment of food; but, indeed, all food is water, for it is by moistening (the food) therewith that one eats here whatever one does eat.
15. This Viṣṇu, the (Soma-) sacrifice, they then divided amongst themselves into three parts: the Vasus (received) the morning-pressing, the Rudras the midday-pressing, and the Ādityas the third pressing.
16. Agni (received) the morning-pressing, Indra
p. 444
the midday-pressing, and the Viśve Devāḥ the third pressing.
17. The Gāyatrī (received) the morning-pressing, the Triṣṭubh the midday-pressing, and the Jagatī the third pressing. The gods went on worshipping and toiling with that headless sacrifice.
18. Now Dadhyañc Ātharvaṇa knew this pure essence[9], this Sacrifice,--how this head of the Sacrifice is put on again, how this Sacrifice becomes complete.
19. He then was spoken to by Indra saying, 'If thou teachest this (sacrificial mystery) to any one else, I shall cut off thy head.'
20. Now this was heard by the Aśvins,--'Verily, Dadhyañc Ātharvaṇa knows this pure essence, this Sacrifice,--how this head of the Sacrifice is put on again, how this Sacrifice becomes complete.'
21. They went up to him and said, 'We two will become thy pupils.'--'What are ye wishing to learn?' he asked.--'This pure essence, this Sacrifice,--how this head of the Sacrifice is put on again, how this Sacrifice becomes complete,' they replied.
22. He said, 'I was spoken to by Indra saying, ‘If thou teachest this to any one else, I shall cut off thy head;’ therefore I am afraid lest he should indeed cut off my head: I cannot take you as my pupils.'
23. They said, 'We two shall protect thee from him.'--'How will ye protect me?' he replied.-They said, 'When thou wilt have received us as thy pupils, we shall cut off thy head and put it aside elsewhere; then we shall fetch the head of a horse, and put it on thee: therewith thou wilt teach us; and when thou wilt have taught us, then Indra will cut off that head of thine; and we shall fetch thine own head, and put it on thee again.'--'So be it,' he replied.
24. He then received them (as his pupils); and when he had received them, they cut off his head, and put it aside elsewhere; and having fetched the head of a horse, they put it on him: therewith he taught them; and when he had taught them, Indra cut off that head of his; and having fetched his own head, they put it on him again,



6
25. Therefore it is concerning this that the Ṛṣi has said (Ṛg-v. I, 116, 12), 'That Dadhyañc Ātharvaṇa, with a horse's head, anywise spoke forth unto you two the sweet doctrine:'-'Unrestrainedly he spoke this,' is what is thereby meant.
26. One must not teach this to any and every one, since that would be sinful, and lest Indra should cut off his head; but one may only teach it to one who is known to him, and who has studied sacred writ, and who may be dear to him, but not to any and every one.
27. He may teach it to one dwelling with him (as a pupil) for a year; for the year is he that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thereby gratifies, and therefore he may teach it to one dwelling with him for a year.
28. For three nights he keeps the rule (of abstinence); for there are three seasons in the year, and the year is he that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that one: it is him he thereby gratifies, and therefore he keeps the rule for three nights.
29. Hot[10] (water) he sips, thinking, 'I will teach it as one practising austerities.' He teaches it whilst abstaining from flesh-food, thinking, 'I will teach it as one practising austerities;'
30. And whilst not drinking out of earthen (vessels); for whatever untruth (man) speaks on this (earth) is, as it were, immixed with her: therefore (one should do so) whilst not drinking out of earthen (vessels);
31. And whilst not coming into contact with Śūdras and remains of food; for this Gharma is he that shines yonder, and he is excellence, truth, and light; but woman, the Śūdra, the dog, and the black bird (the crow), are untruth: he should not look at these, lest he should mingle excellence and sin, light and darkness, truth and untruth.
32. And, verily, he that shines yonder is glory; and as to that glory, Āditya (the sun), that glory is just the sacrifice; and as to that glory, the sacrifice, that glory is just the Sacrificer; and as to that glory, the Sacrificer, that glory is just the officiating priests; and as to that glory, the officiating priests, that glory is just the sacrificial gifts: hence, if they bring up to him a dakṣiṇā he must not, at least on the same day, make over these (objects) to any one else lest he should make over to some one else that glory which has come to him; but rather on the morrow, or the day after: he thus gives it away after having made that glory his own, whatever it be--gold, a cow, a garment, or a horse.
33. And, verily, he who either teaches or partakes of this (Pravargya), enters that life, and that light. The observance of the rule thereof (is as follows). Let him not cover himself (with a garment) whilst the sun shines, lest he should be concealed from that (sun). Let him not spit whilst the sun shines, lest he should spit upon him. Let him not discharge urine whilst the sun shines, lest he discharge it upon him. For so long as he shines, so great he (the sun) is: thinking, 'Lest I should injure him by these (acts),' let him take food at night, after striking a light, whereby it is made to be a form of him who shines yonder. But on this point Āsuri used to say,--One rule the gods indeed keep, to wit, the truth: let him therefore speak nothing but the truth.
Kanda XIV, adhyaya 1, brahmana 2 1. He equips (the Mahāvīra) with its equipments;--inasmuch as he equips it therewith from this and that quarter, that is the equipping nature of the equipments[1] (sambhāra): wheresoever anything of the sacrifice is inherent, therewith he equips it[2].



7
2. He gets ready a black antelope-skin,--for the black antelope-skin is the sacrifice[3]: it is at the sacrifice he thus prepares (the pot);--with its hairy side (upwards),--for the hairs are the metres: on the metres he thus prepares it;--(spread out) on the left (north) side[4],--for the north is the quarter of men;--on (the skin) with its neck-part to the east[5], for that (tends) towards the gods.
3. With a spade (he digs out the clay), for the spade is a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt is vigour: with vigour he thus supplies and completes it (the Pravargya).
4. It is made of Udumbara (Ficus glomerata) wood, for the Udumbara is strength[6]: with strength, with vital sap, he thus supplies and completes it.
5. Or of Vikaṅkata (Flacourtia sapida) wood; for when Prajāpati performed his first offering, a Vikaṅkata tree sprang forth from that place where, after offering, he cleansed (his hands); now an offering is a sacrifice, and (consequently) the Vikaṅkata is the sacrifice: with the sacrifice he thus supplies and completes it.
6. It is a cubit long, for a cubit means the (fore-) arm, and with the arm strength is exerted: it (the spade) thus is composed of strength, and with strength he thus supplies and completes it.
7. He takes it up, with (Vāj. S. XXXVII, 1), 'At the impulse of the god Savitṛ, I take thee by the arms of the Aśvins, by the hands of Pūṣan: thou art a woman;'--the import (of this formula) is the same as before[7].
8. Having placed it in his left hand, he touches it with the right, and mutters (Vāj. S. XXXVII, 2), 'They harness the mind, and they harness the thoughts, the priests of the priest, of the great inspirer of devotion; the knower of the rites alone hath assigned the priestly offices: great is the praise of the god Savitṛ;'--the import of this is the same as before[8].
9. He then takes the lump of clay with the (right) hand and spade on the right (south) side, and with the (left) hand alone on the left (north) side[9], with (Vāj. S. XXXVII, 3), 'O divine Heaven and Earth,'--for when the sacrifice had its head cut off, its sap flowed away, and entered the sky and the earth: what clay (firm matter) there was that is this (earth), and what water there was that is yonder (sky); hence it is of clay and water that the Mahāvīra (vessels) are made: he thus supplies and completes it (the Pravargya) with that sap; wherefore he says, 'O divine Heaven and Earth,'--'May I this day compass for you Makha's head,'--Makha being the sacrifice, he thus says, 'May I this day accomplish for you[10] the head of the sacrifice;'-'on the Earth's place of divine worship,'--for on a place of divine worship of the earth he prepares it;--'for Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!'--Makha being the sacrifice, he thus says, 'For the sacrifice (I consecrate) thee, for the head of the sacrifice (I consecrate) thee.'
10. Then an ant-hill[11] (he takes, and puts on the skin), with (Vāj. S. XXXVII, 4), 'Ye divine ants,'--for it was they that produced this: just in accordance with the way in which the head of the sacrifice was there cut off, he now supplies and completes it with those (ants);--'the firstborn of the world,'--the firstborn of the world, doubtless, is this earth[12]: it thus is therewith that he supplies and completes it;--'may I this day compass for you Makha's head on the Earth's place of divine worship:--for Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!'--the import of this is the same as before.
11. Then (earth) torn up by a boar (he takes), with (Vāj. S. XXXVII, 5), 'Only thus large was she in the beginning,'--for, indeed, only so large was this earth in the beginning, of the size of a span. A boar, called Emūṣa, raised her up, and he was her lord Prajāpati: with that mate, his



8
heart's delight, he thus supplies and completes him[13];--'may I this day compass for you Makha's head on the Earth's place of divine worship: for Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.
12. Then Ādāra[14] (-plants), with (Vāj. S. XXXVII, 6), 'Indra's might ye are,'--for when Indra encompassed him (Viṣṇu) with might, then the vital sap of him, thus encompassed, flowed away; and he lay there stinking, as it were. He said, 'Verily, after bursting open (ā-dar), as it were, this vital sap has sung praises:' thence Ādāra (-plants originated); and because he lay there stinking (pūy), as it were, therefore (they are also called) Pūtīka; and hence, when placed on the fire as an offering, they blaze; and hence also they are fragrant, for they originated from the vital sap of the sacrifice. And inasmuch as Indra, on that occasion, encompassed him with might, therefore he says, 'Indra's might ye are;'--'may I this day compass for you Makha's head on the Earth's place of divine worship: for Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.
13. Then goat's milk;---for when the sacrifice had its head cut off, its heat went out of it, wherefrom the goat was produced: it is with that heat[15] that he thereby supplies and completes it;--with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.
14. These, then, are the five equipments with which he equips (the Pravargya),--fivefold is the sacrifice, and fivefold the victims, and five seasons are in the year, and the year is he that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies. These (objects), thus brought together, he touches with, 'For Makha (I consecrate) thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.
15. Now there is an enclosed space[16] on the north side: whilst proceeding towards that (shed) they mutter (Vāj. S. XXXVII, 7; Rig-v. I, 40, 3), 'May Brahmaṇaspati go forward!'-Brahmaṇaspati (the lord of devotion) doubtless is he that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that one: it is him he thus gratifies; hence he says, 'May Brahmaṇaspati go forward;'-'may the goddess Gladness go forward!'--for the goddess Gladness she (Vāc[17]) is;--'unto the hero[18], kindly to men and the dispenser of fivefold (offerings),'--he thereby praises and magnifies it (the Pravargya),--'unto the sacrifice may the gods lead us!'--he thereby makes all the gods its guardians.
16. It is an enclosed space;--for at that time the gods were afraid, thinking, 'We hope that the fiends, the Rakṣas, will not injure here this our (Pravargya):' they accordingly enclosed for it this stronghold, and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now enclose for it this stronghold.
17. He then deposits (the sambhāras[19]) on the mound with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before. He then takes a lump of clay and makes the Mahāvīra (pot) with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee,'--the import of this is the same as before;--a span high[20], for the head is, as it were, a span high;--contracted in the middle[21], for the head is, as it were, contracted in the middle. At the top he then draws it out (so as to form) a spout[22] of three thumbs’ breadths (high): he thereby makes a nose to this (Mahāvīra, or Pravargya). When it is complete, he touches it with (Vāj. S. XXXVII, 8), 'Makha's head thou art,'--for it indeed is the head of Makha Saumya (the Soma-sacrifice). In the same way (he makes) the other two (Mahāvīra pots[23]); silently two milking-bowls (pinvana[24]), and silently two Rauhiṇa-plates[25].



9
18. Verily this sacrifice is Prajāpati, and Prajāpati is both of this, defined and undefined, limited and unlimited[26]. Whatever one does with a Yajus formula, by that one makes up that form of him (Prajāpati) which is defined and limited; and whatever one does silently, by that one makes up that form of him which is undefined and unlimited: verily, then, whosoever, knowing this, does it on this wise, makes up that whole and complete Prajāpati. But he also leaves over a lump of spare (clay) for expiations.
19. He then smooths[27] it by means of Gavedhukā grass (Coix barbata),--for when the sacrifice had its head cut off, its vital sap flowed away, and therefrom those plants grew up: with that vital sap he thus supplies and completes it;--with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before, In the same way the other two (Mahāvīra pots); silently the two milking-bowls, silently the two Rauhiṇa-plates.
20. He then fumigates these (vessels) with (Vāj. S. XXXVII, 9), 'With dung of the stallion, the impregnator, I fumigate thee,'--for the stallion is an impregnator, and the impregnator means vigour: with vigour he thus supplies and completes it,--'on the Earth's place of divine worship: for Makha thee, for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before. In the same way (he fumigates) the other two (Mahāvīra pots); silently the two milking-bowls, and silently the two Rauhiṇa-plates.
21. He then bakes them, for what is baked belongs to the gods. He bakes them by means of bricks, for they it was that did so on that occasion[28]: just in accordance with the way in which the head of the sacrifice was there cut off, he now supplies and completes it with those (bricks), But, indeed, let him bake them with anything[29] whereby they may become properly baked. Having laid down the fuel for baking[30], he puts down the Mahāvīra (pot), with, 'For Makha thee, for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before. In the same way the other two Mahāvīra (pots); silently the two milking-bowls, silently the two Rauhiṇaplates. By day he should bury them (in the hole), and by day he should take them out, for the day belongs to the gods.
22. He takes out (the first pot) with (Vāj. S. XXXVII, 10), 'For the righteous one (I take) thee,'--the righteous one, doubtless, is yonder world, for the righteous one means truth; and he that shines yonder is the truth, and the first Pravargya is that (god): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For the righteous one (I take) thee.'
23. With, 'For the efficient one thee' (he takes out the second pot),--the efficient one (sādhu), doubtless, is he (Vāyu, the wind) that purifies here by blowing, for as a permanent one (siddha) he blows through these worlds; and the second Pravargya is that (god): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For the efficient one (I take) thee.'
24. With, 'For a good abode thee!' (he takes out the third pot),--the good abode, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world, for it is in this world that all creatures abide; and the good abode also is Agni (fire), for Agni abides with all creatures[31] in this world; and the third Pravargya is that (god): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For a good abode thee.' Silently (he takes out) the two milking-bowls, and silently the two Rauhiṇa-plates.
25. He then pours goat's milk upon them[32] (the first) with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before. In the same way the other two; silently the two milking-bowls, and silently the two Rauhiṇa-plates.
26. And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance of the rule thereof is the same as at the creation[33].



10
Kanda XIV, adhyaya 1, brahmana 3 1. Now at the time when he there[1] proceeds with the guest-meal, he who intends to perform the Pravargya, prior to the Upasads[2], spreads Kuśa grass with its tops directed towards the east, in front of the Gārhapatya, and places the vessels thereon in pairs[3],--the Upayamanī (tray) and the Mahāvīra (pot), the pair of lifting-sticks[4], the two milking-bowls, the two Rauhiṇa-plates, the two offering spoons for the Rauhiṇa (cakes), and whatever other (implement) there is,--these make ten, for the Virāj consists of ten syllables, and the sacrifice is Virāj: he thus makes this to be equal to the Virāj, the sacrifice. And as to their being in pairs,--a pair means strength, for when two take hold of each other they exert strength; and a pair (couple) means a productive union: with a productive union he thus supplies and completes it.
2. Then the Adhvaryu takes the (lustral) sprinkling water, and, stepping up, says, 'Brahman, we shall proceed: Hotṛ, sing praises!' for the Brahman is seated on the right (south) side as the guardian of the sacrifice: to him he thus says, 'Sit thou undistracted: we are about to restore the head of the Sacrifice;' and 'Hotṛ, sing praises!' he says, because the Hotṛ is the sacrifice: he thus thereby says to him, 'Restore the head of the sacrifice!' and accordingly the Hotṛ begins to recite-
3. [Vāj. S. XIII, 3,] ‘The Brahman, firstborn from afore[5],--the Brahman, doubtless, is yonder sun, and he is born day by day from afore (in the east); and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'The Brahman (n.), firstborn from afore.' He then sprinkles (the vessels): the import of this is the same as before[6].
4. He sprinkles (the chief Mahāvīra) with (Vāj. S. XXXVII, 11), 'For Yama thee!'--Yama, doubtless, is he who shines yonder, for it is he who controls (yam) everything here, and by him everything here is controlled; and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For Yama (I sprinkle) thee.'
5. 'For Makha thee!'--Makha, doubtless, is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that one: it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For Makha thee.'
6. 'For Sūrya's heat thee!'--Sūrya, doubtless, is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that one: it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For Sūrya's heat thee.'
7. Having taken out a post[7] by the front door (of the śālā), he drives it into the ground on the south side (of the śālā[8]), so that the Hotṛ, whilst singing praises, may look upon it; for the Hotṛ is the sacrifice, and he thereby restores the sacrifice to this (earth), and she causes the Gharma (milk) to rise.
8. Having turned round the Emperor's throne-seat[9] in front of the Āhavanīya, he places it south thereof, and north of the King's (Soma's) throne-seat[10], so as to face the east.
9. It is made of Udumbara wood, for the Udumbara means strength: with strength, with vital sap, he thus supplies and completes it (the Pravargya).
10. It is shoulder-high, for on the shoulders this head is set: he thus sets the head upon the shoulders.
11. It is wound all over with cords[11] of Balvaja grass (Eleusine indica). When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its vital sap flowed out, and thence these plants grew up: with that lifesap he thus supplies and completes it.



11
12 And as to why he places it north (of Soma's seat),--Soma is the sacrifice, and the Pravargya is its head; but the head is higher (uttara): therefore he places it north (uttara) of it. Moreover, Soma is king, and the Pravargya is emperor, and the imperial dignity is higher than the royal: therefore he places it north of it[12].
13. And when the Hotṛ recites this (verse, Rig-v. V, 43, 7), 'Whom the priests anoint, as if spreading him . . .,' he anoints that Mahāvīra which is to be used, all over with ghee[13], with, 'May the god Savitṛ anoint thee with honey!' for Savitṛ is the impeller of the gods, and honey means everything whatever there is here: he thus anoints it (or him) all over with everything here, and Savitṛ, as the impeller, impels it for him,--this is why he says, 'May the god Savitṛ anoint thee with honey!'
14. Now sand has been strewed[14] on the north side of it: below that he (previously) throws (a plate of) white gold[15], with, 'Protect it from contact with the earth!' For at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakṣas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs from below; and that, to wit, gold, being Agni's seed, it (serves) for repelling the fiends, the Rakṣas. But, indeed, the Earth also was afraid of this lest this (Pravargya), when heated and glowing[16], might injure her: he thus keeps it separate from her. White it is, for white, as it were[17], is this earth.
15. And when the Hotṛ recites this (verse, Rig-v. I, 36, 9), 'Sit thee down: thou art great . . .,' sheaths of reed-grass are kindled on both sides[18], and throwing them (on the mound), he puts (the Mahāvīra pot) thereon. When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and therefrom these plants grew up: with that life-sap he thus supplies and completes it.
16. And as to why they are kindled on both sides: he thereby repels the Rakṣas, the fiends, from all the quarters. Whilst this (pot) is being heated, the (Sacrificer's) wife covers her head, thinking, 'Lest this one, when heated and glowing, should rob me of my eyesight,' for it indeed becomes heated and glowing.
17. He puts it on with, 'Flame thou art, glow thou art, heat thou art;'--for the Gharma is he who shines yonder, and he indeed is all that: it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'Flame thou art, glow thou art, heat thou art.'
18. He (the Sacrificer) then invokes blessings on this (earth)[19], for the sacrifice is this (earth): it is thus (whilst being) on her that he invokes blessings, and she fulfils them all for him.
19. [Vāj. S. XXXVII, 12,] 'Unmolested thou art in front (in the east),'--for unmolested by the Rakṣas, the fiends, indeed, this (earth) is in front;--'in Agni's over-lordship,'--he thus makes Agni her over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakṣas;--'grant thou life unto me!'-he thus secures life for himself, and accordingly he attains the full (term of) life.
20. 'Possessed of sons towards the south,'--in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak;-'in Indra's over-lordship,'--he thus makes Indra her over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakṣas;--'grant thou offspring unto me!'--he thus secures offspring and cattle for himself, and accordingly he becomes possessed of sons and of cattle.
21. 'Well to live on behind (towards the western region),'--in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak;--'in god Savitṛ's over-lordship;'--the god Savitṛ he thus makes her over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakṣas;--'grant thou eyesight unto me!'--he thus secures eyesight for himself, and accordingly he becomes possessed of eyesight.



12
22. 'A sphere of hearing towards the north,'--'causing (sacrificial calls) to be heard[20],' is what he thereby means to say;--'in the creator's over-lordship,'--the creator he thus makes her overlord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakṣas; 'grant thou prosperity (increase) of wealth unto me!'--wealth, prosperity, he thus secures for himself, and accordingly he becomes wealthy and prosperous.
23. 'Disposition above,'--'disposing[21] above' is what he thereby means to say;--'in Bṛhaspati's over-lordship,'--Bṛhaspati he thus makes her over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakṣas;--'grant me vigour!'--vigour he thereby secures to himself, and accordingly he becomes vigorous, strong.
24. On the right (south) side (of the Mahāvīra) he (the Sacrificer) then makes amends by (laying down) the hand with the palm upwards, with, 'Shield me from all evil spirits!' whereby he means to say, 'Protect me from all troubles!' When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and went to the Fathers, but the Fathers are three in number[22]: it is with these that he thus supplies and completes it (the Pravargya).
25. Thereupon, whilst touching her (the earth)[23],
'Thou art Manu's mare,' for, having become a mare, she (the earth) indeed carried Manu, and he is her lord, Prajāpati: with that mate, his heart's delight, he thus supplies and completes him (Prajāpati, the Pravargya, and Sacrificer).
26. He then lays pieces of (split) Vikaṅkata wood round (the Mahāvīra), two pointing to the east[24], with (Vāj. S. XXXVII, 13), 'Hail! be thou encompassed by the Maruts!'--the call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last[25]; for the call of 'hail!' is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies; and hence he places the call of 'hail!' first, and the deity last.
27. 'Be thou encompassed by the Maruts,' he says; for the Maruts are the (common) people: he thus surrounds the nobility by the people, whence the nobility here is surrounded on both sides by the people. Silently (he lays down) two pointing to the north[26], silently (again) two pointing to the east, silently two pointing to the north, silently two pointing to the east.
28. He makes them to amount to thirteen, for there are thirteen months in the year, and the year is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and hence he makes them to amount to thirteen.
29. He then places a gold plate (weighing a hundred grains) on the top (of the pot), with, 'Protect it from contact with the sky!' For at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakṣas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs from above; and that--to wit, gold--being Agni's seed, it (serves) for repelling the fiends, the Rakṣas. But, indeed, the Sky also was afraid of this lest this (Pravargya), when heated and glowing, might injure it: he thus keeps it separate therefrom. It is yellow, for yellow, as it were, is the sky.
30. He (the Adhvaryu) then fans (the fire) thrice by means of (three) fans[27], whilst muttering, 'Honey!' each time; for honey means breath: he thus lays breath into it. Three (fans) there are, for there are three breathings, the out (and in)-breathing, the up-breathing and the through-breathing: it is these he thus lays into it.



13
31. They then fan it thrice[28] in the non-sunwise way. When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and went to the Fathers,--the Fathers being three in number[29]: with them he thus supplies it.
32. But, indeed, the breathings depart from those who perform the fanning at the sacrifice. They fan again thrice in the sunwise way,--this makes six; and six in number are these breathings (vital airs) in the head: it is these he thus lays into it. They cook the two Rauhiṇa (cakes). When a blaze is produced, he takes off the gold (plate).
33. And when the Hotṛ recites this (verse, Rig-v. I, 112, 24), 'Successful, O Aśvins, make ye our voice,' the Adhvaryu steps up, and says, 'The Gharma is aglow[30].' If it be aglow, he may know that the Sacrificer will become more prosperous; and if it be not aglow, he may know that he will become poorer; and if it be neither aglow nor the reverse, he may know that he (the Sacrificer) will become neither more prosperous nor poorer: but indeed (the pot) should be fanned so (long) as to be aglow.
34. And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the same as at the creation[31].
The fourteenth kāṇḍa, up to the beginning of the Brihad-āraṇyaka, is entirely taken up with the exposition of the Pravargya, an important, though optional and subsidiary, ceremony performed on the Upasad-days of Soma-sacrifices. Whilst the central feature of this sacrificial performance consists of a ceremony of an apparently simple and unpretending character, viz. the preparation of a hot draught of milk and ghee, the Gharma, which the Sacrificer has to take, after oblations have been made thereof to various deities, the whole rite is treated with a considerable amount of mystic solemnity calculated to impart to it an air of unusual significance. A special importance is, however, attached to the rough clay pot, used for boiling the draught, and manufactured and baked in the course of the performance itself; it is called Mahāvīra, i.e. the great man or hero, and Samrāj, or sovereign lord, and is made the object of fervid adoration as though it were a veritable deity of well-nigh paramount power.
Although the history of this ceremony is somewhat obscure, the place assigned to it in the Soma-ritual would lead one to suppose that its introduction must have taken place at a time when the main procedure of the Soma-sacrifice had already been definitely settled. This conclusion is also borne out by the position taken up towards this ceremony by the authorities of the Black Yajur-veda. For whilst the Maitrāyaṇīyā Saṃhitā gives at least the formulas used for it, the Kāṭhaka, on the other hand, takes no notice whatever of it, and the Taittirīya school only deals with it in its Āraṇyaka. Nevertheless, this ceremony can boast of a respectable antiquity, seeing that it is treated of at some length in the Brāhmaṇas of the Ṛk--viz. Ait. Br. 1, 18-22; Kaush. Br. VIII, 3-7; and this circumstance alone might almost seem to justify the inference that it was in that very school of ritualists that this item of the sacrificial ceremonial was first elaborated. It is very doubtful, however, whether such an inference would find any support in the dogmatic explanation of the ceremony offered by some of the theologians of the Ṛg-veda. At the end of the Pravargya section, in a passage which has a somewhat disconnected appearance, and seems hardly in consonance with previous dogmatic explanations, the Aitareya-brāhmaṇa makes the secret import of the ceremony to be that of a mystic union of the gods resulting in the generation of a new, divine body for the Sacrificer. This explanation, having been previously adopted by Haug and Garbe, was recorded without question in a note to part ii (p. 104) of this translation. Further consideration of this matter has, however, convinced me that the theory. referred to fails altogether to account for the origin of the ceremony, as well as for important points in its performance which find a ready



14
explanation in the theory applied to it by the present work, as well as by the TaittirīyaĀraṇyaka and the Kauṣītaki-brāhmaṇa. For seeing that the main object of sacrificial performances generally is the reconstruction of Prajāpati, the personified universe, and (the divine body of) the Sacrificer, it is difficult to see why, for this latter purpose, a new and special ceremony should have been thought necessary; and, besides, the rejected theory, if it is at all to account for the high honour rendered to the Mahāvīra pot, would almost involve the recognition of a form of Liṅga-worship which surely would require very much stronger evidence than the isolated and (to my mind) somewhat suspicious passage on which this theory is based.
Now, as regards the rival theory underlying the exposition of the Pravargya, as given in the Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa, it makes the Mahāvīra pot a symbol of the sun, whilst the hot milk draught represents the divine flood of life and light with which the performer of the ceremony becomes imbued. These symbolic interpretations, whatever we may think of them otherwise, certainly adapt themselves admirably to the general sacrificial imagery. As the sun is the head of the universe--or, in figurative language, the head of Prajāpati, the world-man--so its earthly, and earthen, counterpart, the Mahāvīra pot, is the head of Viṣṇu, the sacrificial man, and the Sacrificer; and this ceremony is thus performed in order to complete the universe and sacrifice, as well as the divine body of the Sacrificer, by supplying them with their head, their crowning-piece, so to speak; and to imbue them with the divine essence of life and light. For this purpose the theory rather ingeniously avails itself of certain myths vaguely alluded to in the Ṛg-veda, according to which (X, 171, 2) Indra cut off the head of Makha (here identified with Viṣṇu, the sacrifice and the sun-god); and (I, 116, 12; 117, 22; 119, 9) Dadhyañc, the son of Atharvan, was fitted by the Aśvins with a horse's head, and this hippocephalous creature then communicated to them the Madhu, or sweet thing,--that is, as would appear, the sweet doctrine of the Soma, the drink of immortality. This symbolism readily explains some points connected with the Pravargya ceremony, for which no obvious reason seems otherwise to suggest itself. For one thing, it accounts for the deep reverence shown to the Gharma vessel, which, in fact, is no other than the giver of light and life himself; whilst the optional character of the ceremony explains itself from the fact that the Soma-cup, of which the Sacrificer will subsequently partake, might of itself be expected to supply him with the blessings which he hopes to derive from the Pravargya. And, finally, it also becomes clear why the Pravargya must not form part of a man's first performance of a Soma-sacrifice.
For the Pravargya, as we have seen, is performed on the preliminary days of the Somasacrifice, before the pressing of the Soma has taken place; and it obviously is only after he has actually partaken of the Soma-drink, and has thereby potentially 'put on immortality,' that he can partake of the Gharma, and thus become imbued with the celestial light[67]. The dogmatical explanation of this ceremony thus puts, as it were, the finishing touch to that strange allegory by which the Indian theologians sought to make the sacrificial ceremonial a practical illustration of that unity of the All which speculation had been striving to compass since the days when the emptiness of the Vedic pantheon had dawned upon the thinking mind, and when critically inclined bards ventured to sing of the national god[68]: 'Not for a single day hast thou fought, nor hast thou any enemy, O Maghavan: illusion is what they say concerning thy battles; no foe hast thou fought either to-day or aforetime.'
As regards the optional and somewhat recondite character of the Pravargya ceremony, it is probably not without significance that the section dealing therewith is combined with the speculative Bṛhadāraṇyaka so as to make up with it the last book of the Brāhmaṇa; the Āraṇyaka-kāṇḍa, or forest section. Such, at least, is the case in the Mādhyandina text, where the Pravargya section occupies the first three adhyāyas of the last (fourteenth) book; whilst



15
the Kāṇva text presents a slight difficulty in this respect. What passes generally as the seventeenth (and last) kāṇḍa of that version, consists of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka; whilst the sixteenth kāṇḍa begins with the section on funeral rites, corresponding to the last (eighth) adhyāya of kāṇḍa XIII of the Mādhyandina recension, and is stated[69] to include also the Pravargya section (Madhy. XIV, 1-3). Now it is a strange fact that the six adhyāyas of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka (XIV, 4-9 in the Mādhyandina text) are counted 3-8 in the Kāṇva text,--a circumstance which manifestly can only be explained by the Pravargya section being taken to form the first two adhyāyas of the last book of that version. This, indeed, is probably implied in the remark added to the description of a MS. of the Kāṇva text in the catalogue of the MSS. of the Sanskṛt College, Benares (p. 44), according to which 'Pravargyakāṇḍasya patrāṇi' are 'bhinnapramāṇākṣarāṇi,'--that is, 'the leaves of the Pravargya section have a special pagination' (? i.e. they are numbered independently of the section on funeral rites preceding them).

Horses for the hereafter Person as author: Gryaznov, Mikhail Petrovich [3] In: The UNESCO Courier: a window open on the world, XXIX, 12, p. 38-41, illus. Seven score stallions in the grave of a mountain king.

“For many centuries, the immense expanse of the steppes from the river Danube to the Great Wall of China formed a single vast cultural-historical region...created for themselves a culture which was uniform in its general outlines. This broad uniformity resulted from the fact that the culture had taken shape through a series of identical stages of development, which unfolded simultaneously across the whole belt of the steppes. This process began in the Aeneolithic period, the time of transition from the Stone Age to the era of metals...The uniformity in the historical development of all the steppe tribes became particularly evident in the time of Scythians, when the population of the steppes went over to the nomadic way of life, became highly mobile and developed under conditions of extensive inter-tribal cultural exchanges...Until recently, the only undisputed premise in these arguments was that the



19
Scythian culture and art came into being in the 7th century BCE and that the attainments of Scythian culture with its presumed pre-Asiatic sources slowly spread to the East in somewhat modified forms...some remarkable monuments of the culture of the early nomads of Siberia, magnificent specimens of their original art. Among these are the amazing gold collection of Peter I, the Pazyryk kurgans (burial mounds) in the Altai (see page 31) and the bronze objects and megalithic enclosures of the kurgans of the Tagar culture on the river Yenisey.
“During the last 20 years, monuments of the early Scythian period have been discovered in Central and Southern Kazakhstan, as well as in the western foothills of the Altai and in Tuva. It has become clear that cultures of the Scythian type came into being in the East no later than in Scythia itself...Many Scythian specialists were surprised by the discovery in 1971, at different points in the Scytho-Siberian lands, of three remarkable monuments – the royal kurgan of Ptichata Mogila in Bulgaria, near the town of Varna, two rich burials in the Vysokaya Mogila on the Dnieper and the royal kurgan of Arzhan in the Tuva Autonomous Soviet Republic. All of these are dated to the 8th-7th centuries BCE, a time which precedes the early Scythian period, and the first two monuments are accepted by the majority of scholars as being pre-Scythian or Cimmerian in culture...
:Nomad chieftains were often buried with their horses – in some cases scores of them, as in the great 8th-7th century BCE tomb-complex (Autonomous Soviet Republic of Tuva). See: remains of Arzhan’s vast circular wooden structure, 120 metres in diameter. Left, plan of Arzhan showing the honeycomb-like network of its chambers. Tiny horse-figures indicate where horses were buried – upto 30 in each chamber. In the central chamber the nomad chieftain and his queen were buried with magnificent ceremony. No less thatn 6000 trees were felled to build the tomb and over 10,000 persons are thought to have attended the funeral. Below left, bronze plaque of a coiled wild beast by a nomad artist. Unearthed at Arzhan it is one of the biggest of its kind ever found.
“Arzhan is a vast stone tomb, the biggest in the Sayan mountains ---120 metres in diameter. Under its stone mound, a unique wooden structure of enormous dimensions has been splendidly preserved. A large square wooden framework, with an area of more than 65 square metres, is placed directly on the ground. Seventy other such frameworks are arranged around it in radial lines and circles. These together form round wooden platform, about three metres high, which were covered by a ceiling.
“...The central chamber contained, on a soft litter made of horses’ manes and tails, a small framework with double walls and a ceiling, in which the bodies of the king and his queen were placed in separate sarcophagi made of hollowed logs. They were dressed in rich clothing made of multicoloured imported fabrics and costly furs (sable and others)...
“Only one small golden plaque and pieces of golden leaves, some turquoise beads and a bead necklace and 20 small turquoise discs, which were probably the inlay of massive golden plaques depicting animals...”(p.39)
“Only in some of the logs had objects been preserved: these included ornaments of gold and turquoise, bronze arrows, a dagger and some other items...On the fourth side of the royal framework were stacked six saddle horses. Of their rich and magnificent harness there remain a few ornaments from the bridle and saddle straps, some gold and silver, and some made of coloured stone or boar tusks...There are few harness ornaments, but there are wonderful



20
examples of Scytho-Siberian animal style art – an enormous bronze figure of a beast of prey rolled in the form of a ring, and an ivory head of a bridled horse.“ (p.40)
“...It can no longer be said that the Scytho-Siberian cultures formed in the 7th century BCE or later spread from a single centre in different directions, including the East. Secondly, it is clear that the determining factor in the development of the steppe population at that time was the transition to a new economy based on nomadic cattle-breeding. This stimulated the development of new farming methods and cultural forms.”

"The Scythians emerged as a people prior to the 7th Century BC, when they were first mentioned in historical records. The Scythian civilization consisted of a number of distinct tribal groups scattered across the Pontic Steppes, Caucasus, and Central Asia. Though primarily a nomadic people, the Scythians established a number of settlements across their territory; these establishments in turn allowed for the development of a sedentary society and the accompanying development of trade skills, including metalworking. Scythian knowledge of metalworking likely originated with the peoples of Iran and China, with this knowledge spreading along trade routes and arriving in the steppes from the 2nd to 1st Millennium BC. Early Scythian metallurgy was centered around bronzeworking, as these skills had already been widely adopted by the Scythians' neighbors. The Minusinsk Basin of Siberia has been speculated as the origin point for the raw materials used in Bronze-age Scythian metallurgy, and Scythian access to this region fueled the peoples' later centuries of expansion. During the 8th Century BC Scythians were often employed by nations in the Near East and these returning soldiers may have brought knowledge of iron-working back to their homeland, and by the start of the 6th-century BC the practice was widespread in the Pontic steppes.In addition to bronze and iron working, gold and copper-working were also present in Scythian society; in his commentary on the Scythian people, Greek historian Herodotus remarked on their fondness for making things from gold and copper." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythian_metallurgy
“Horse-Headed” Staffs and the Cult of the Horse Head in Northwestern Asia in the 2nd Millennium BCE --I.V.Kovtun
Abstract
This article analyzes the semantics of staffs with the sculptural representations of horse heads. Such staffs were discovered in the steppe and forest-steppe Ob-Irtysh region; they date back to the beginning or the first half of the 2nd millennium BC. Stylistically early and later objects are identified. The study provides some parallels with Siberian ethnographic data and the mythology of the Indo-European peoples. The Indo-Aryan semantic content of the Vedic mythological tradition is used for interpreting the meaning of the staffs. The article suggests that the semantic range of the “horse-headed” stone staffs and the Seima-Turbino pommel belongs to the worldview of the carriers of the Indo- Aryan dialects.

10.177.01 The wise behold their mind; (seated) in their heart the Sun made manifest by the illusion of the asura; the sages look into the solar orb, the ordainers (of solar worship) desire the region of his rays. [Illusion of the asura: asurasya = the supreme Brahma devoid of all disguise; aktam ma_yaya_ = united, to knowledge, all-knowing].
10.177.02 The Sun bears the (sacred) word in his mind the Gandharva has spoken it, (abiding) within the womb; sages cherish it in the place of sacrifice, brilliant, heavenly ruling the mind. [Sacred word: va_k: the three Vedas; Taittiri_ya Bra_hman.a 3.12.9: in the morning the deity moves in the sky with the hymns of the R.k, he abides at noon in the Yajurveda, at his setting he is extolled with the Sa_maveda; the sun moves accompanied by the three Vedas; gandharva: from gah (voices), and dhr. (to hold) = the breath of life].

1. THE sapient with their spirit and their mind behold the Bird adorned with all an Asuras' magic might. Sages observe him in the oceans' inmost depth: the wise disposers seek the station of his rays. Laurie L. Patton translation: The wise behold with their mind in their heart the Sun, made manifest by the illusion of the Asura. The sages look into the solar orb, the ordainers desire the region of his rays.
Dayananda Saraswati translation: The one who has entered the Prana, who is the Prana of the Pranas, owing to His grace the wise ones whole-heartedly (devotedly) observe with great interest the constant (observable) activity in the life (empirical existence) of the Jiva (the individual self); but those who are blessed with sharper and deeper insight are able to see stationed within (merged with) the Lord (the supreme Self) all those Jivas that have attained moksha (liberation); therefore, the wise adore the Lord who rests shining ever so brightly. According to Wash Edward Hale RV 10.177.1 could refer to the myth of the Svarbhanu hiding the Sun with darkness until it was found by the Atris; if so, this is the only occurrence of asura, in the singular, referring to a mythological evil or demonic being.(Wash Edward Hale (1986). Asura:In Early Vedic Religion. Motilal Banarsidass. p. 78.)

The Sun bears the word in his mind; the Gandharva has spoken it within the wombs; sages cherish it in the place of sacrifice, brilliant, heavenly, ruling the mind. Dayananda Saraswati translation: The Jiva sincerely employs its ability to speak ("speech"); the speech which emerges from within in the form of (various/numerous) words is impelled by the Prana residing within the body having been inspired by it; the all-spreading brilliant lightrays and the vibrant air (collectively) together gathering that word-form speech lifts that speech carrying it to all corners of space (for it to be heard). 3 I saw the Herdsman, him who never resteth, approaching and departing on his pathways. He, clothed in gathered and diffusive splendour, within the worlds continually travels. Laurie L. Patton translation: I beheld the protector, never descending, going by his paths to the east and the west; clothing the quarters of the heaven and the intermediate spaces. He constantly revolves in the midst of the worlds. Dayananda Saraswati translation: The lord of the senses, the all-knowing one, as the witness, watches the imperishable Jiva who in accordance with its past and present works is repeatedly born in this world and passes through many types of agreeable and disagreeable births.

"Puja has unclear origins. J. A. B. van Buitenen states that "puja" emerged from yajna rituals, linking it to the Pravargya Vedic rite "[Axel Michaels (2004). Hinduism: Past and Present. Princeton University Press. pp. 241–242.)] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)
Pravargya was a ceremony introductory to the Agniṣṭoma. "The whole Pravargya ritual has two distinct parts: the preparation of the earthen implements, especially the gharma or mahavira and the rites performed on the latter immediately after taking out of the furnace. These rites include the offering of hot milk to the Ashvins, and repeating it in the evening and so for three consecutive days preceding the upasad. At its conclusion, the implements used in this ritual, particularly the mahavira are carried in procession to uttaravedi and buried there." Pravargya cf. Houben, Jan E.M. (1991). The Pravargya

The symbolism of the Mahavira vessel (central to Pravargya process), is the Sun, the "all seeing eye." The Mahavira vessel has links to metallurgy.

“Now, their knowledge further increased by the secret they had learned from the horse's head, they also knew how to restore the head of Makha. But did the "sweet," the Madhu, that only Indra and Dadhyanc knew and that Dadhyanc announced to the Asvins through the horse's head remain un- changed from the Rg Veda to the Brahmana. "The R̥ gVeda speaks of the "sweet" (madhu) of Tvastr, it also speaks of the fly that gave away the Madhu, the "sweet" (RV.1.119.9). Tvastr's sweet is Soma. Indra once stole the Soma from Tvastr (RV.3.48.4), whereas the fly betrayed the secret to the Asvins. In the ancient story of the Rg Veda, the secret of Soma is betrayed to the Asvins, by Dadhyanc, or else it is betrayed to them by a fly. Was the "sweet" that Dadhyanc knew the knowl- edge of



42
Soma and where the Soma could be found? The horse's head of Dadhyanc was submerged in Saryanavat. Saryanavat is a lake or river in mountains of Kuruksetra. It is rich in Soma. (RV.9.65.22,23; Say. on 1.84.14; cf. 10.35)...The Madhu in the Rg Veda has the secret of Soma for its content. This secret, the repository of Indra's strength, is revealed by Dadhyanc to the Asvins...
"The secret knowledge by which the Asvins, the celestial Healers, restored the sacrifice is contained in the Mantras of the Hymn to the Light (RV.10.177.1-3). It is these incantations which are meant by the Divakirtyas of which the Satapatha Brahmana speaks (S'B.4.1.5.15; SV.2.803-805; Uhyagana.2.2.9). By the power of these words addressed by the Asvins to the Light radiating from the Sun the head of Makha is restored to the body of the sacrifice...
"The other ingredients of the Mahivira pot are: earth from a termite hill for these termites had been divinized and made "first born of the world in return for the part they played in the severance of Visnu's head; earth turned up by a boar, for it was the boar Emusa-Prajapati that raised the earth herself-she was quite small then-into existence. These two additional kinds of earth establish mythically the consistency and existence of the substance of the Mahavira vessel from the beginning of things...
"In the Rg Veda however, it was another secret that Dadhyanc betrayed to the Asvins. This secret was "Madhu," the innermost "sweetness," Soma. (RV. 1.116.12; 1.117.22)...”

.After Fig. 2 Gandhara grave culture (Ghalegay V period) face urn from Zarif Karuna near Peshawar, now in the Islamabad Museum.Source: Parpola, Asko, The face urns of Gandhara and the Nasatya cult in: Asko Parpola, ed., Migration, trade and peoples Part 3: Aryans and Nomads, London, British Assn. for South Asian Studies, British Academy, pp. 149-162. "The parallelism in the head symbolism between the gharma vessel in the cult of the As'vins -- the 'possessorsof horses' -- and the face of the urn of the Gandhara Graves appears not to be just a coincidence...the conspicuous three-dimensional 'nose' of the later face urns has a counterpart in the gharma vessel. The Satapatha Brahmana (14.1.2.17) describes the preparation of the gharma vessel thus: 'He then takes a lump of clay and makes the Mahavira (pot) with (the mantra), 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!...a span high, for the head is, as it were, a span high; -- contracted in the middle, for the head is, as it were, contracted in the middle. At the top he then draws it out (unnayati) (so as to form) a spout (mukham 'mouth') of three thumb's breadths (high); he thereby makes a nose (nAsikam) to this (Mahavira, or Pravargya).' It is true that the description does not exactly match the



43
making of the face urns of the Gandhara Graves, but it is remarkable that the gharma pot alone of all the vessels described in the Vedic literature is expressly told to have a 'nose'. It is also true that the Satapatha Brahmana is the only Vedic text to mention this 'nose', and although its present redactions are younger than the texts of the Black Yajurveda, it goes back to an earlier version and its contents in some respects differ entirely from all the other texts. That it can well have preserved ancient traditions prevalent among the Kanvas is quite likely on the basis that one of the two redactions belongs to the Kanvas. The 'nose' of the face urn and the gharma pot should have some specific function, and it indeed is meaningful when considered in the context of the As'vin cult...Comparing the gharma vessel with the cinerary urn of the Gandhara Grave culture implies that there should be a close relationship between the gharma rite and the funeral. I think such a relationship does indeed exist. According to the Rigveda, the gharma rite was instituted by Atri and offered by his descendants out of gratitude to the As'vins, because these had saved Atri from the distress of the rbIsa pit. It was the As'vins who had first given the hot gharma drink to Atri while saving him, so the gharma rite imitates the service rendered by the As'vins. I am arguing that the Atri legend reflects the Atri clan's initial adoption of the cremation burial and the associated cult of the As'vins as funeral deities, who revive the dead by means of their drink of heated milk. These funeral practices new to them the Atris took over from the Kanvas, with whom they established friendly relations while setting in Gandhara." (pp.156-157).

Dadhīci (दधीथच).—(also Dadhyañja, Dadhyanga) the son of Atharvan and Citti.1 A sage of much eminence. Taught aśvāśiras mantra to Aśvins and nārāyaṇa varma to Tvaṣṭri, who gave it to Viśvarūpa. The Lord advised Indra to meet the sage whose bones would serve as best weapons to cut Vṛtra's head. When the gods waited on him with this desire, he argued at first that no one would be willing to part with his life. But, he would agree for their sake to sacrifice his life. When he cast off his body, Viśvakarma made it a Vajra for the use of Indra.2 Dadhīci's is an example of one, who gave up life in service...Dadhici was a Vedic king, son of Atharvan, who turned a great Rishi. Dadhicha gave his bones to destroy Vritra, a brahmin, who became the head of the Asuras.
(DADHĪCI).
Birth.
A famous hermit. Mention is made in Mahābhārata, Śalya Parva, Chapter 51, Stanza 83, that this hermit was the son of the great hermit Bhṛgu, and that he was made of the essences of the world, with a huge body.
The birth of the hermit Sārasvata.



50
Dadhīca erected his hermitage on the bank of the river Sarasvatī and began to do penance. The power of penance increased daily. Seeing this Indra was flurried. So he sent the celestial maid Alaṃbuṣā to break the penance of Dadhīca somehow or other. Alaṃbuṣā came to the hermitage of Dadhīca and began to dance and sing. When the hermit saw her he grew lustful and seminal discharge occurred to him. The semen fell in the river Sarasvatī, who became pregnant and in due course gave birth to a child. She took the child to the hermit Dadhīca and told him the story of the child. The hermit was much pleased. He took the child and embraced it and blessed the river Sarasvatī thus:
"Brahmā, the gods and the celestial maids will be pleased if your water is offered as oblation."
Dadhīci then said that the child should be named Sārasvata. He also added that when there was a drought continuously for twelve years, Sārasvata would have the power to bring rain. Then Sarasvatī took the child to her abode and brought it up.
How he destroyed the asuras with the head of a horse.
Once Dadhīci went to the world of the devas (gods). From there he looked down and saw the earth filled with the asuras. Indra went to destroy them. But he could not. So he made a search for anything left behind by Dadhīca. He understood that Dadhīca had with him the head of a horse. It was found in a lake in the country of Śaraṇya. With the bones taken from that head Indra and Dadhīca destroyed a large number of asuras. (Ṛgveda, Maṇḍala 1, Anuvāka 13, Sūkta 84).
The weapon
(Vajra) of Indra was made from a bone. A story occurs in the Mahābhārata, which says that the Diamond-weapon of Indra was made of a bone of Dadhīci. The asuras went to fight with Indra under the leadership of Vṛttrāsura. Indra tried his utmost to kill Vṛttrāsura, but he could not. At last Indra approached Brahmā, who told Indra that if a bone of the hermit, called Dadhīca was obtained it could effectively be used against Vṛtra. Accordingly Indra went with Nara and Nārāyaṇa to the banks of the river Sarasvatī and entered the hermitage and bowed before the shining hermit Dadhīca and informed him of their errand. The hermit replied that he had no objection in giving his bone to save the gods. Saying thus the hermit discarded his life. Indra took the bone of Dadhīci and made his weapon of Diamond (Vajra) with which he killed Vṛtra and his followers. (Mahābhārata, Chapter 100).
Other information
(1) At the sacrifice of Dakṣa, Dadhīci got angry because Śiva was not given his dues of the sacrifice. (Mahābhārata Śānti Parva, Chapter 284).
(2) Once Dadhīci talked to a Brāhmin called Karuṇa about the importance of the ashes dedicated to Śiva. (Padma Purāṇa, Chapter 101).
