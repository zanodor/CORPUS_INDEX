About ‘meaningless’ grids
on Indus seals
M-496 B M-496 A
This is one of the most remarkable tablets from the Indus valley because both the front and the back show the same grid. At first sight it seems completely meaningless, but there is still a few things to say about this.



M-499 F M-499 A
Grids were also known in Sumer and there they had different meanings, such as: 'bed', 'bread', 'loaf', 'food', 'grass',' herb', 'pasture', 'plant (s)' and 'reed mat':

As can be seen from the following seals, the meaning of the grid in the Indus Valley Civilization is akin to ‘grass’, ‘pasture’ and ‘plants’ as it means: ‘land’ or ‘field’.



M-881
On this broken seal there is an agricultural tool on both sides of a grid from which we can conclude that this sign indeed symbolizes ‘field’ or ‘land’.
Number 1 Number 2
The two agricultural tools on the seal are similar to this hoe and plow used in ancient Egypt.
Number 1 Development of the hoe. (Top) Primitive Egyptian hoe cut from a forked branch. (Bottom) A more developed form with hafted wooden blade. Both Middle Kingdom (2375-1800 BC). Source: Singer et al. 1954. A History of Technology Fig 350, p. 539.
Number 2 Egypt Civilization, 3.000 BCE Ancient Egyptians had simple farming tools like winnowing scoops, hoes, rakes, flint-bladed sickles, plows. The material they used were wood, ivory, bone, and stone. A winnowing scoop is to separate the grain from the chaff/husk.

This seal also confirms that a grid does indeed represent a field: at the top of this seal is a field on which crop grows. The inhabitants of the Indus Valley did not draw in perspective, so we look straight at the crop and at the same time we look at the field from above. So, here the grit is a land or a field too.
Nowadays we could display field and crop in this way.



M-884 A
And on this seal are six short dashes that symbolize ‘seed’ and thus this seal indicate that the two fields produce seed.
According to the Rigveda Indra is the Lord of corn-lands:
Rigveda 8-21 called: ‘Indra’.
3 ‘Come hither, for the drops are here, O Lord of corn-lands. Lord of horses, Lord of kine: Drink thou the Soma, Soma's Lord!’
He is the giver of barley:
Rigveda 1-53 called ‘Indra’.
2 ‘Giver of horses, Indra, giver, thou, of kine, giver of barley, thou art Lord and guard of wealth: Man's helper from of old, not disappointing hope, Friend of our friends, to thee ,as such we sing this praise.’
He gives corn and cattle:
Rigveda 10-42 called: ‘Indra’.
7 ‘With thy fierce bolt, O God invoked of many, drive to a distance from afar the foeman. O Indra, give us wealth in corn and cattle, and make thy singer's prayer gain strength and riches.’
And brings food:
Rigveda 10-131 called: ‘Indra’.
1. ‘Drive all our enemies away, O Indra, the western, mighty Conqueror, and the eastern. Hero, drive off our northern foes and southern, that we in thy wide shelter may be joyful. 2 What then? As men whose fields are full of barley reap the ripe corn removing it in order, So bring the food of those men, bring it hither, who went not to prepare the grass for worship.’



M-382AC
However, on this seal Indra holds a spear because he is not only ‘Lord of the Corn lands’ but he is also a warrior:
Rigveda 1-169 called: ‘Indra’.
2 ‘The various doings of all mortal people by thee are ordered, in thy wisdom, Indra. The host of Maruts goeth forth exulting to win the light-bestowing spoil of battle. 3 That spear of thine sat firm for us, O Indra: the Maruts set their whole dread power in motion. E'en Agni shines resplendent in the brush-wood: the viands hold him as floods hold an island’.
M-1976
M-0400
These almost identical tablets show some of Indra’s activities:
1. First, he is the lord of the two fields. 2. Then he defeats drought with his spear. 3. The short vertical stripes symbolize that he produces barley. 4. And the wombs on the right symbolize that he gives strength to children and lets them be born.
Some of these activities are mentioned in the next Rigveda verses:
Rigveda 3-53 called: ‘Indra, Parvata, Etc’.
11 ‘Come forward, Kusikas, and be attentive; let loose Sudas's horse to win him riches. East, west, and north, let the King slay the foeman, then at earth's choicest place perform his worship. (-) 18 O Indra, give our bodies strength, strength to the bulls who draw the wains,
Strength to our seed and progeny that they may live, for thou art he who giveth strength’.



M-1315
And this broken tablet shows a fish next to the warrior Indra:
1. First, he is the lord of the two fields. 2. In the middle he defeats drought with his spear. 3. And the fish on the right symbolizes that Indra let the water flow.
The last activity is mentioned in this Rigveda hymn:
Rigveda 1-174 called: ‘Indra’.
3 ‘With whom thou drivest troops whose lords are heroes, and bringest daylight now, much worshipped Indra, With them guard lion-like wasting active Agni to dwell in our tilled fields and in our homestead. 4 They through the greatness of thy spear, O Indra, shall, to thy praise, rest in this earthly station. To loose the floods, to seek, for kine, the battle, his Bays he mounted boldly seized the booty. (-)
9 A Stormer thou hast made the stormy waters flow down, O Indra, like the running rivers. When o'er the flood thou broughtest them, O Hero, thou keptest Turvaga and Yadu safely. 10 Indra, mayst thou be ours in all occasions, protector of the men, most gentle-hearted, Giving us victory over all our rivals. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.
H-184 A
According to the Tolkāppiyam Murugan is identical with four different gods:
1. Māyōṉ ‘the dark one’ (identified with Vishnu), 2. Vēntaṉ ‘the sovereign’ (identified with Indra) 3. And Korravai ‘the victorious’ (identified with Kali) 4. And Varunan ‘the sea god’.
‘In Tamil literature: The Tolkāppiyam, one of the most ancient texts of the Tamil literature, mentions cēyōṉ ‘the red one’, who is identified with Murugan, whose name is literally Murukaṉ ‘the youth’; the other gods referred to in the Tolkāppiyam are Māyōṉ ‘the dark one’ (identified with Vishnu), Vēntaṉ ‘the sovereign’ (identified with Indra) and Korravai ‘the victorious’ (identified with Kali) and Varunan ‘the sea god’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murugan
The above list makes it clear that Murugan is also identified with Indra and on the seal above he walks hand in hand with his wife, the storm goddess Devasena. They are Lord and Mistress of the two fields.



M-252
On this seal are also two human figures:
1. The figure on the left stands next to a knife, which shows that this human figure is Murugan, because he is the deity of Krittika, a nakshatra that is symbolized by a knife. 2. On the right is his wife, the storm goddess Devasena. She stands under a dash which indicates that she produces seed. 3. These two figures show that man (Murugan) and wife (Devasena) are similar, they both manage the two fields. 4. The twelve dashes indicate the moon goddess Shashthi, the second wife of Murugan: it is clear that number twelve is related to the twelve moons, the twelve months and the twelve chalices of Soma (another name of the moon):
Rigveda 1-25 called: ‘Varuna’
8 ‘True to his holy law, he knows the twelve Moons with their progeny: He knows the Moon of later birth’.
Rigveda 7-103 called: ‘Frogs’
9 ‘They keep the twelve month's God-appointed order, and never do the men neglect the season’.
Rigveda 10-114 called: ‘Visvedevas’
‘While they at sacrifices fix the metres, they measure out twelve chalices of Soma. 6 While they arrange the four and six-and-thirty, and duly order, up to twelve, the measures’.
5. The fish represents the river goddess Valli, the third wife of Murugan.
And thus, this seal shows the activities of Murugan and his three spouses.



M-1329 A
This tablet shows some similar signs:
1. Indra is the Lord of the field on the left. 2. He is a warrior and with his spear he defeats drought. 3. The dash indicates the storm goddess Devasena as she usually produces seed. 4. In the middle a fish indicates the river godess Valli. 5. The three triangles (wombs) symbolize Tridevi: the three women of Kartikeya: Shashthi, Devasena and Valli. 6. And the six-divided womb on the right symbolizes that Shashthi (sixth) gives birth to a child.
So, this seal shows the activities of Murugan and his three spouses too.
M-497 B M-497 A
Again, both the front and the back of this tablet show the same grid symbolizing two fields. The field on the front indicates Murugan/Indra, who is the Lord of the corn-fields, and the field on the back indicates his wife Devasena, who usually produces seed.
Tablets like this one may have belonged to farmers.
Thanks to Brenda Beck's questions, suggestions and enthusiasm, I had to investigate further, dig deeper and look more closely, and these activities resulted in this and the following essays.
