Gola Dhoro (Bagasra) compartmented seal is a metallurgy certification for cargo of a seafaring catamaran
-- with square inscribed copper tablets to describe the details of the metalwork cargo
Gola Dhoro (Bagasra) 23°3′30′′N 70°37′10′′E Kutch, Gujarat
Seven Indus Script inscribed seals were found at Bagasra (Gola Dhoro). One unique seal is a compartmented seal with a socket (and a removable lid) to hold some object (Fig. 11, 12). In addition to the inscription on one side, all other sides of the seal have hatched faces of incised lines and crossed lines (Fig. 13). The size of the seal is 1.39 length x 1.44 width X.7 cm thick. The find spot of the seal is close to a faience workshop of Bagasra. Source: http://www.heritageuniversityofkerala.com/JournalPDF/Volume5/1.pdf

Sonawane , 2017, Inscribed Unicorn Seals from Bagasra, Gujarat: A Comparative Analysis of Morphology, Carving Styles, and Distribution Patterns in: Heritage: Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies in Archaeology 5 (2017): 01‐21.
I suggest that the socket would have held a square copper tablet (of less than 1 cm.square) of the type (mostly found from the Great Bath area) in Mohenjo-daro. (212 copper tablets have been analysed and deciphered in the following monographs:

Such square copper tablets might have been inserted in the socket to further certify the attributes of the metalwork equipment and cargo included in the shipment on the jangada, 'catamaran'.

The hatchings on the sides of the seal are also hieroglyphs: khaṇḍa 'divisions' rebus: khaṇḍa 'equipment'. singhin 'forward thrusting, spiny horned' rebus: singi 'ornament gold'
kondh ‘young bull’. kũdār ‘turner, brass-worker’. sangaDa 'lathe, brazier' rebus: sangAta
'collection' (of metalwork) jangada 'cargo boat, catamaran'; koTiya 'rings on neck' rebus: kotiya 'baghlah dhow, cargo boat'.kunda 'lathe' rebus: kunda 'fine gold' PLUS kamata 'portable gold furnace' rebus: kammata 'mint'.
Text message: aya, ayo 'fish' rebus: aya 'iron' ayas 'alloy metal' PLUS dhakka 'lid' rebus: dhakka ' blazing, brightmetal' PLUS gaNDA 'four' rebus: khaNDa 'implements'. Thus metal implements of unsmelted metal. bhaTa 'warrior' rebus: bhaTa 'furnace' dula 'pair' rebus: dul 'metal casting' PLUS kamaTha 'bow and arrow' rebus: kammaTa 'mint, coiner, coinage'. Thus metal castings from furnace of mint. kanac 'corner' rebus; kancu 'bronze'. Thus, the seal signifies metalwork of: unsmelted metal, bronze, implements and furnace work/metal castings in a mint. The socket of the Bagasra compartmented seal may have contained some square copper tablets with additional specifications of the cargo being shipped. One example of a square copper tablet of Mohenjo-daro and information contained on it is as follows: .
Text message of A1a inscription: Split parenthesis (lozenge): mũh, muhã 'ingot' or muhã 'quantity of metal produced at one time in a native smelting furnace.'.PLUS kolmo 'rice plant' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge'. Thus, ingot forge.

ayo ‘fish’ rebus: aya 'iron' ayas 'alloy metal' (R̥ gveda) PLUS dhāḷ 'slanted stroke' rebus: dhāḷako 'ingot' Pk. karaṁḍa -- m.n. ʻ bone shaped like a bamboo ʼ, karaṁḍuya -- n. ʻ backbone ʼ.( (CDIAL 2670) rebus: karaDa 'hard alloy' baraḍo 'spine, backbone' rebus: baran, bharat ‘mixed alloys’ (5 copper, 4 zinc and 1 tin) (Punjabi) kanka, karṇika 'rim of jar' rebus: karṇī 'supercargo, scribe, helmsman'.
Field symbol: short-tailed markhor looks back: The short-tailed antelope or markhor is a caprid kid, comparable to the hieroglyph shown on 1) a Dholavira seal in front of 'sun' hleroglyph and 2) a Dholavira seal ion front of a horned person within a ficus glomerata arch, and monkey
करडूं karaḍū 'kid' Rebus: karaḍā 'hard alloy'. Rebus 2: karaḍā 'daybook (accounting ledger)(Marathi); Rebus 3: kharādī ' turner' (Gujarati). PLUS క్రమ్మ ర krammara. adv. క్ రమ్ మ రి ల్ల ు or క్రమ్రబడు Same as క్రమ్మ రు 'look back' (Telugu). Rebus: krəm backʼ(Kho.)(CDIAL 3145) Rebus: kamar 'artisan, smith' + shorttail: xolā 'fish tail' rebus: kol 'working in iron', kolhe 'smelter'.
Thus, together, the rebus message: smelter, hard alloy of copper. Alternative to identification as 'kid' is that of an antelope: ranku ‘antelope’ rebus: ranku ‘tin’.
Text message on obverse of A1b (together with hieroglyph of an antelope
looking back)
ranku 'liquid measure' rebus: ranku 'tin'.
kūdī, kūṭī ‘bunch of twigs’ (Sanskrit) Rebus: kuṭhi ‘smelter furnace’ (Santali) kūdī (also
written as kūṭī in manuscripts) occurs in the Atharvaveda (AV 5.19.12) and Kauśika Sūtra (Bloomsfield’s ed.n, xliv. Cf. Bloomsfield, American Journal of Philology, 11, 355; 12,416; Roth, Festgruss an Bohtlingk, 98) denotes it as a twig. This is identified as that of Badarī, the jujube tied to the body of the dead to efface their traces. (See Vedic Index, I, p. 177). · ·
kanka, karṇika 'rim of jar' rebus: karṇī 'supercargo, scribe, helmsman'. Thus, the text message is: tin smelter supercargo
This alternative reading is jusfied and consistent with the hieroglyph on the text of the
message which signifies ranku 'liquid measure' rebus: ranku 'tin'.
