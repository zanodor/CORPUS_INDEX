The Myth of Girra and Elamatum
by Christopher Walker
This story tells the story of Girra, the god of fire and light, after
defeating Elamatum, the great god Enrile arranged the fate of Girra
and gave him a high status above his brother. Girra, the Greek baby,
is the name of the Aka German, and in the Sumerian language is the
Gilbil.
Elamatum may be the cause of famine and livestock failure. Just like
other myths against the enemy (such as Marduk against Tiamat,
Ning Urta against Anzu), after defeating the enemy, Gila gained his
glory. The death of Elamatum is apparently made by Enrile's
command to become a cosmic feature visible in the sky, and it
seems that there is still a festival to commemorate her failure. The
same idea took place at the end of the Agushaya hymn, where Ea
hosts a dance festival every year to commemorate the birth of Saltu
and Istar's successful taming of his wildness.
Who is Elamatum? The lack of mud boards allowed scholars to know
only her name and Gila killed her. If this myth reflects historical
events, then she may be the embodiment of Elan (the eastern enemy
of the two rivers regimes). But whether she is simply identified as
Elan's Istar is questionable. More likely to be associated with Elan,



she represents other influences, such as the incarnation of famine,
plague, disease, etc. Later spells in the Maqlu series listed Elan's
women as witches with women from Gutium, Sutium, Lullubum and
Hanigalbat, and their magic would be expelled by fire (Girra).
Elamatum's astronomical identity is still uncertain, but Elamatum is
known as an ancient Babylonian star or constellation name. The
ancient Babylonian prayers for "gods of the night" contain the
following list of stars: qastum elamatum zappum sitaddarum
mushussum eriqqum enzum kusarikkum - "bow (= part of the Great
Dog Constellation), Elamatum (=?), 鬃Mao (= Pleiades), people
attacked by weapons (= Orion), dragons (=?), carriages (= Big Bear),
she-goats (= Lyra), bison (=?).
The repeated text in the Lichacev assembly has the following variant
list: 12 qastum nirum(yoke = Arcturus)sitaddarum mushussum
eriqqum enzum kusarikkum basmum('horned snake'=?). Therefore,
elamatum and zappum are omitted from the duplicate text, and
nirum and basmum are added. Until now, qastum elamatum has
been used as a separate expression: "Elamite bow". This
interpretation seems to be supported by the fact that in the later
astrology text, the bow (MUL.BAN = qastum) was recognized with
Anu's daughter "Elan's Istar".
However, the mythical text shows that elamatum will be treated as
the name of a single star group. There is no evidence that Elamatum
is waving a bow in this myth. The natural interpretation of lines 36
38 is that Elamatum has itself become a new constellation.
The fact that Elamatum's identity has not been identified by
astronomy is not important, because the same, mushuSsum,
kusarikkum, balmum, mushuum and basmum like elamatum have not
been confirmed in later astronomy. For example, "Elam's stars
(MUL.ELAM.MA ld) are equivalent to the later Salbatanu (Mars)



planets in the astrological text, representing Anzu and Ninazu, but
this has not been confirmed in astronomy. It is about irrelevant.
