Monkeys are Indus Script hieroglyphs to signify armourer, wealth resources; Monkey Business: AegeanIndus Exchange -- Marie N. Pareja
This is an addendum to: Blue monkey frescoes of Akrotiri, Greece. kuṭhāru 'monkey, armourer'; mūhū 'black-faced monkey) rebus mũhã̄ 'ingot' are Indus Script hieroglyphs https://tinyurl.com/ugl634uFour types of monkeys are shown as tributes of 'apes, monkeys' from Musri to Shalamaneser III on the Black Obelisk.
The cross or + shape and chevron motifs are also Indus Script hieroglyphs.
Chevron or inverted V is a lid on a pot; this is an Indus Script hieroglyph:
ḍhaṁkaṇa 'lid' rebus dhakka 'excellent, bright, blazing metal article'. Thus, together, the cross or + shape and chevron motifs signify fire altar (producing) bright blazing metal articles.

^ Inverted V, m478 (lid above rim of narrow-necked jar) The rimmed jar next to the tiger with turned head has a lid. Lid ‘ad.aren’; rebus: aduru ‘native metal’ karnika 'rim of jar' Rebus: karni 'supercargo' (Marathi) Thus, together, the jar with lid composite hieroglyhph denotes 'native metal supercargo'. karn.aka = handle of a vessel; ka_n.a_, kanna_ = rim, edge; kan.t.u = rim of a vessel; kan.t.ud.iyo = a small earthen vessel; kan.d.a kanka = rim of a water-pot; kan:kha, kankha = rim of a vessel. In an alternative reading, the pot PLUS lid is read rebus as: dhakka karni 'bright metal supercargo'.
Archaeological evidence has been found for a + shaped agni-konḍa 'fire pit of live coals, sacred fire altar' at Malhar.

Monkey Business: New Evidence for Aegean-Indus Exchange
By Marie N. Pareja
The Aegean is over 6000 kilometers from the Indus Valley. So how did these two centers of ancient civilization come into contact, and why were monkeys involved?
Archaeological evidence for long distance trade can sometimes be surprising. A recent reexamination of one of the wall paintings from the site of Akrotiri on the island of Thera shows possible connections between the Indus and the Aegean during the Bronze Age. The exchange between these regions, whether by land or by sea, was likely indirect and involved at least one—if not several—middlemen (Fig. 1). Evidence suggests that Mesopotamia is the likely intermediary, as the region’s trade with both the Indus and Aegean is well documented. It also serves as the most likely place in which Aegean artists may have observed Indian monkeys.

Bronze Age Aegean monkey and ape iconography first appears during the Early Bronze Age (ca. 3100-2100 BCE) in the form of figurines, many of which double as stamp seals. Nearly all of the creatures are shown in a crouching-squat position and are drilled with a hole for suspension, perhaps from a bracelet (Fig. 2). A unique figurine sits in an upright human-like position, as though on a stool, and the bottom of the base is inscribed with a cross-andchevron motif (Fig. 3). These figurines are only found in at the very end of the third millennium BCE.

From the Middle through Late Bronze Age (ca. 2100-1100 BCE), monkey iconography occurs in glyptic art. The animals appear in the familiar crouching-squat position, and they are usually found together with floral elements, baskets, and female figures (Fig. 4). Yet again we have an outlier: one seal preserves a monkey wearing a belt or halter together with a male figure among a field of plants (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, almost all seals combine elements that are readily visible in the much larger-scale wall paintings from Knossos on Crete and Akrotiri on Thera.

From the end of the Middle Bronze Age into the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, monkeys are freed from the crouching-squat, represented with mostly blue fur, and shown in a variety of poses and contexts. They pick crocus flowers from rocky outcrops and flower pots (Fig. 6), roam wildly through both verdant and rocky landscapes, reside outside of a temple or shrine, and they make offerings of saffron to a seated goddess (Fig. 7). When the images from wall paintings and glyptic art are considered together, they clearly depict different possible phases of a crocus ceremony that may have been performed during the Bronze Age, in which women and monkeys engage in both collecting and offering crocuses and/or saffron to a nature deity.

Scholars have traditionally attributed the appearance of monkeys in Aegean art to Egypt due to the prevalence of indigenous monkeys to Egypt and the clear and longstanding trade connections between the Aegean and Egypt since the EBA. Importantly, no monkeys or apes are indigenous to the Aegean or Near East, and so Occam’s Razor seemed to apply: the simplest solution is the most likely one, until proven otherwise. Enter an international team of primatologists specializing in Old World species, a renowned taxonomic primate illustrator, and an art historian/archaeologist.

Primatologists Tracie McKinney, Jo Setchell, Jessica Mayhew, and Ray Heaton worked together with Stephen Nash, a taxonomic illustrator, and myself, a Bronze Age Aegean specialist. We examined Aegean and select Egyptian, Near Eastern, and Mesopotamian primate imagery. Although archaeologists and art historians have reviewed this corpus of primate iconography before, they lacked the experience of intensely studying and working with live animals. They also compared these depictions only with species found in Africa.
This collaborative project is the first in which primatologists reviewed the imagery to verify the previously proposed species of monkey. Consistent with previous publications, many of the animals in Egyptian art were vervets and varieties of baboons. Although highly fragmentary, most of the monkeys in Aegean art are likely baboons, too. The monkeys that play on rocky outcrops from Room 6 of Building Complex Beta at Akrotiri (Fig. 8), however, appear less like the Egyptian vervet and much more like the langur, a species native to parts of Bhutan, Nepal, and India.
The tail position, proportions, and eyes are the most immediate indicators that they are langurs rather than vervets. Although vervets tend to carry their tails outward, with the end of the tail slanting down at the end (Fig. 9), langurs more commonly arc their tails in a characteristic C- or S-shape (Fig. 10). The general physical proportions of the animals’ faces and limbs more closely resemble those of langurs than vervets, as well. Langurs are also considerably larger than cat-sized vervets.

Fig. 10B. Gray Langur monkey (Semnopithecus) with a C-shaped tail. (Smithsonian.org) This new identification is particularly exciting because it shows that the live monkeys were observed directly at some point, so that these physical nuances could be accurately recorded in order to create the wall painting. Notice the subtle detail of each face: even the dark facial markings are different for each preserved face! These monkeys are rendered as individuals, rather than as a copied and repeated motif that is meant to represent the idea of “monkey” (as is found in Egyptian artwork). It also means that these differences were important enough to warrant such precise rendering from life. As no physical remains of monkeys have yet been discovered in the Aegean, it seems most likely that artists and/or travelers encountered langurs in Mesopotamia, with whom they traded by the early the Late Bronze Age. After all, langurs are identified on some Mesopotamian cylinder seals, and exchange between the Indus and Mesopotamia is well documented. Longstanding relationships and exchange routes may be traced through three primary means: the movement of certain raw materials (lapis lazuli, carnelian, chalcedony, and tin, among others), textual evidence (such as late third millennium BCE story The Curse of Agade), and the transmission and translation of iconography. The two outlier objects mentioned above help to trace the connections between the Aegean and the Indus via Mesopotamia. Notably, Mesopotamian elites imported exotic animals and flaunted their resulting menageries as a testament to access to far-flung places, the raw materials from those places, and participation in an elite identity with those who reciprocated this exchange.

The seal that shows a male figure together with a monkey (Fig. 5) may be related to a series of terracotta plaques from Mesopotamia that also show a male figure together with one or two monkeys, who even wear a leash and collar (Fig. 11). The plaques may show a travelling entertainer and his pets and/or costars. This imagery is currently thought to be imported from even farther east, from a place where monkeys are indigenous.
Fig. 12. Cross and chevron motif from seal from Pirak. After Enault 1979, pl. XLV, C, Period IIIC, drawn by M.N. Pareja. The lone monkey figurine that sits upright (Fig. 3), may be related to stamp seals from Bactria in Central Asia, on which monkeys, humans, and hybrid animals are shown sitting in such positions. Critically, the cross-and-chevron motif on the bottom of this stamp seal can be traced through both time and space to the Indus Valley. The motif appears incrementally earlier, the farther east it is found, from Anatolia and the Levant, to Mesopotamia, to Bactria, finally to the Indus Valley, where it appears at least as early as 3600 BCE. (Fig. 12)
Other items illustrate these connections as well, such as carnelian beads found in EBA II (ca. 27—2500 BCE) contexts at Aegina, a small island near Athens. Carnelian beads were shaped into elongated barrel forms in the Indus Valley. They then passed through Mesopotamia, where beads were cut to create several more, and some were incised with a concentric ring pattern. Some of these beads were recovered from Aigina, illustrating that the earliest of these exchange patterns date to at least the EBA, considerably earlier than the date of the langur wall painting.
Thanks in parts to monkeys and sharp-eyed artists, the Bronze Age world seems much larger and much more interconnected than we previously thought.
