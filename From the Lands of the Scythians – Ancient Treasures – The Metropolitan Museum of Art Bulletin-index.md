It was a dazzling experience. It was also the of years of delicate, at times frustrating, but
rewarding negotiations with the Ministry of Culthe Soviet Union to secure the best of the gold for this exhibition. Those negotiations, which
Soviet colleagues looked upon with optimism and enthusiasm, were successful. This landmark
From the Lands of the Scythians,comprising 197 works of art from the ancient civilizations of the at now are part of the Soviet Union, is the
of what promises to be an extraordinaryseries f culturalexchanges between the museumsof the Soviet and the Metropolitan. Our part of the first round
of exchanges opens at the Hermitage in May and will
of 100 masterpieces of European and American from our collections, one of the finest shows Metropolitan has ever mounted. Why did we choose for the first exhibition these stun
Scythian gold objects, the fabulous carvings and frozen tombs of Siberia?The answer is
They are unique in the world not only in quality in type. I have seen literally abundancesof gold and
precious objects in museums aroundthe globe, ancient Egyptian through Greek and medieval to he fabled treasuresof more modern kings and emperors. are like the contents of the Gold Rooms of the or Kiev State Historical Museum. Nothing
can quite match the beauty,craftsmanship,and power of these awesome objects assembled by the unknown kings, princes, and chieftains of the sixth, fifth, and fourth centuries B.C., whose territories were larger by far than all the lands of the then so-called civilized world. Looking
at the abstractmajesty of the great gold panther (color plate 5) and then at the sublime idealism of the human
figures in the superbcomb (color plates 12, 13 ) one feels as if one were seeing the archetypesof the two funda
mental styles
of art: one, the abstract,
decorative art of hieratic symbolism that will wend its way through
time, through Byzantine art, through the mystifyingly complex animal interlacesof the Book of Kells, and even to the abstractimpulses of our day. The other reflectsthe serene, balanced human idealism of the ancient Greek
experience. Who were these people - the Urarteans,the Scythians, the tribes of the Altai mountains, the Sarmatians who commissioned and collected objects of such exceptional
beauty and sophistication?Little is known. They had no recorded written language,
no coinage.
And that is normally the formula for historical oblivion. But we have their great works of art and some history, too. For the Scythianswe have the Greek historian Herodotus, whose accountis included in this catalogue. Even in his own day he was called a quaint teller of fanciful tales, but modern
archaeology has proven him uncannily accurate about Scythianburial customs and techniques of warfare.
Herodotus portrait of the Scyth is not particularly complimentary: the Scyth was a nomad, a fierce hunter

cknowledgments
Mr. Hoving and I wish to thank everyone who partici
pated in organizing and presenting this magnificent exhibition. Few other exhibitions have drawn on so many individuals in so many different areas, and in this case the task was especially difficultas the material is, for the most part, unfamiliar to the majorityof Americans. Out
side scholarsgave generously of their time, and amongst them I wish to single out Professors Ann Farkas of
Brooklyn College, John F. Haskins of the University of
Pittsburgh, and Veronique Schiltz of the University of Besancon. Curators on the staff of the Metropolitan
Museumplayed an indispensableandvaried role, writing essays and interpretive comments on many of the pieces for the catalogueentries, and providing othereducational
information: Prudence Oliver Harper, Ancient Near
East; Dietrich von Bothmer, Greek and Roman; Helmut
Nickel, Arms and Armor; Jean Mailey, Textile Study Room; and Jean K. Schmitt, Far Eastern Art. Katharine Stoddert, aided by Joan Holt, coordinated
the preparation of the catalogue, a difficult assignment since these are complex fields rife with scholarlydisputes. To be recognized in the Education Department are
Melanie Snedcof, assisted most ably by Holly Pittman, Marie-Therese Brincard, and Tobia Frankel, who prepared educational aspectsof the exhibition. StuartSilver
and Clifford La Fontaine designed
the show to combine aestheticimpactwith vitally needed interpretivematerial. The precise negotiations with the Soviets were con
ducted by Mr. Hoving and myself at the Ministry of Culture in Moscow, at The State Hermitage Museum in Leningrad, and at The Kiev State Historical Museum.
Assisting at various stages of the negotiations was James Pilgrim, who should also be commended for his leadership in the area of administration, where the roles of
RosemaryLevai, Kay Bearman,Louise Condit, and John
Buchanan should be acknowledged; and a special note of personal thanks should go to Vera K. Ostoia, who
translated, with enthusiasm and dispatch, catalogue material submitted to us in the Russian language.
We are especially grateful to Dr. Boris Piotrovsky of
the Hermitage, who supplied a lengthy essay that was adapted for the catalogue, and to the directors of the institutions in the Soviet Union who lent some of their
most precious objects to this show. To Irina Antonova, Director of the Pushkin Museum
in Moscow, go particularthanks for facilitating negotiations concerning 100 Masterpieces of European and
American Painting, being sent by The Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Soviet Union as part of this exchange.
Many of the logistical problems were so complicated
that those who resolved them cannot be overlooked in a list of credits: thus our appreciation goes to Victor Sakovich, Cultural Counselor of the Embassy of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics in Washington, D.C., and to Nicolai Loginov, Cultural Attache to the Soviet Mission to the United Nations. On the American
side, a deep debt of gratitudeis owed to John Richardson, Jr., and Peter Solmssen of the Department of State,
Washington, D.C., for their assistance along every step of the way. Finally, we must thank all the others who helped
in
the organization and assembly of this great exhibition and who remain unnamed. Their professionalism and interestdid not go unnoticed.

The Scythians were an Iranian-speakingpeople, one of many groups of nomads who dominated the Eurasian steppes during the first millennium B.C. The Scythian
domains were the lands north of the Black Sea, the
Pontic steppes, describedby the Greek historian Herodo
tus as level, well-watered, and abounding in pasture (IV, 47). Herodotus also recorded very vividly the Scythian way of life, which enabled these nomads to rule so successfully over the various inhabitants of the Pontic
steppes: Having neither cities nor forts, and carrying their dwellings with them wherever they go; accustomed, moreover, one and all of them, to shoot from horseback; and living not by husbandry but on their cattle, their
waggons the only houses that they possess, how can
they fail of being unconquerable, and unassailable
even? (IV, 46).
Many scholars agree that the Scythians originated somewhere in Siberia and that early in the first millennium B.C. they moved westward, into the Near East, and then into the Pontic steppes in the late seventh century B.C. The reason for their western migration, the dates of their Near Easternsojourn, and the causes for their move to the Pontic steppes are all uncertain; the available evi
dence is too fragmentary to allow us to interpret very fully this segment of Scythian history. However, the
Scythian presence
in the Near East is documented in
Assyrian and Urartean royal inscriptions, and Herodotus tells a colorful, if not entirely accuratestory of the Scythian expulsion from the Near East by the Medes, whose
kingdom the Scythians had usurped. Most evidence of Scythian material culture comes from the elaborateand splendid graves in which Scythian rulers were buried. The great importance given to their
king, in death as in life, is amply describedby Herodotus, who mentions that when a Scythian ruler died, he was
embalmed, placed on a wagon, and carried around visit the various tribes over whom he had ruled in li

of the late king's power over his people. Archaeology has shown that much of Herodot writing is correct.In the royal Scythiantombs discove in the northwest Caucasus and on the Pontic stepp women, servants,grooms, and horses were often inter along with the main burial. While the form of the to may vary from site to site, the tombs were always la

homage
to their rulers by providing

the same extravagant possessions the kings must h enjoyed while alive. The objects from the royal tom
are always possessions used in life-weapons, clothi jewelry, even cooking pots. But the workmanship royal possessions was often extremely beautiful; g

represent a rather peculiar blend of barbaric and elegant decoration. The most typical feature of Scythian art is the so
animal style-the proliferation of animal motifs
which the art is adorned. However, it is also typical Scythian art that in the earliest royal burials on the steppes and in the northwest Caucasusthere are
admixtures of foreign styles-Near Eastern and must reflect the various artisans commisto execute Scythian art. Aside from Near Eastern
Greek elements, it is possible to speak of a native art characterized by single animals naturally renderedin several poses: with dangling legs and head, ith rear legs folded forward over the front legs, or
urled into a circle. All these poses may perhaps be in
erpreted as renderings of a dead, passive, or powerless animal, and the Scythians might by this means have intended to destroy or contain the power they believed inherent in the animal images. The same explanation
might be applied to another typically Scythian trait-the se of animal parts like heads, beaks, or hooves to symbolize the entire animal. One of the most common motifs in Scythian art is the stag, very often the reindeer. According to Soviet
scholars, the Iranian name for the Scythians, Saka, may
be interpreted as antler or stag, and the significance
of
the stag image might be that of a totem animal. Other
common animals are felines, perhapssnow leopards, and real or fantastic birds of prey. While Scythian art when executed by Greek artisans often contains narrative scenes that must reflect a Scythian mythology, native
Scythian art relies on the mysterious power of single animals and parts of animals, a power so obvious to the
Scythian peoples that it needed no explanation. The animal style was not confined to Scythian art
alone but was shared by all the nomads who lived along
the Eurasiansteppes as far east as Mongolia; a separate animal style had been developed by earlier inhabitants
of the Caucasus (the Koban culture), and it is possible
that the roots of this artistic tradition lie somewhere in the Russian north. The nomadic animal style provided a rich artistic source for later nomadic peoples, like the Sarmatians, who dominated the steppes after the Scythians had retreated to their Crimean kingdom in the second century B.C. Much later, vestiges of this remark
able style may linger in the extraordinary wealth of animal imagery in the art of the Migrations period.

[Catalogue nos. 1-3}
In 1897 a princely tomb was excavated in the town of Maikop in the northern Caucasus. Covered by a mound
almost thirty-five feet high was a large burial chamber, over twelve by seventeen feet, with wooden walls and paved with river stones. Wooden partitions divided the tomb into three areas: the principal burial was in the
largest, southern part. The skeleton, painted red, was
lying on its backwith legs drawn up, and great quantities of objects, some of gold and silver, lay on and around it.
There were two gold diadems
decorated with double
rosettes, a necklace of rows of gold, lazurite, turquoise, and carnelian beads, and headdress pendants of massive gold wire. The dead man had been placed under a canopy
decoratedwith numerous gold plaques: thirty-eight were
ring-shaped, while sixty-eight represented lions and
nineteen represented bulls (color plate 2, cat. no. 1). Four gold and silver poles have been identified as supports for this canopy, and each ended in sculptures of
bulls cast in gold or silver (cat. no. 2). Flint arrowheads and flint inlays from a knife lay near the skeleton's knees,
and in various parts
of the chamber were found a great number of tools and weapons; in the southeasterncorner, for instance, were some made of copper: axes, a chisel, and a flat dagger with a curving blade fastened to the hilt with silver pins. There were also many vessels: seventeen
stood along the eastern wall-two of gold, one of stone with gold and silver inlay, and the rest of silver. Two of
the silver vases had remarkable decoration. Along the rim of one a mountain range was depicted, with a bear standing on its hind legs between two trees; on the
vessel's body were two rivers that flowed into a cir representing a lake or sea; also shown were two bu a horse, a lion with a bird of prey on its back, a wild bo
an antelope, and a mountain sheep. On the second va
besides some ornamental motifs, appears a scene

[Catalogue os.4-91
The Bronze Age in the southern Caucasus-the nine
teenth to fourteenth centuries B.C.-is represented by remarkablemonuments such as a kurgan in the Trialeti region of Georgia and in Kirovakan in northern Ar
menia. These were graves of chieftains of prosperous cattle-breeding tribes that maintained relations with the countries of the Near East. The chieftain's ashes were
placed on a wooden carriage in the center of a large
funerary chamber (like the burial ritual of the Hatti
kings). Around the carriage ay
skeletons of long-horned
and short-horned cattle, as well as painted or polished vessels, sometimes with carved or stamped ornament. The tools and weapons placed in the graves were made of
bronze: copper alloyed during smelting with arsenic or,
in a newer technique, with tin (which had to be imported
from afar). Objects of precious metals testified to the
high development of the goldsmiths' art;there were cups and goblets of silver or gold (some with chased or relief
decoration), pins, and beads with granulated ornament.
In the Kirovakan kurgan were found silver vessels that
aresimilar in shape and details to the famous gold goblets found at Vaphio in Greece.
In somewhat later burials in Armenia (15th-14th
century B.C.), at Lchashen and Artik, foreign objects such as cylindrical Hurrian seals were found. Such seals, associated with the state of Mitanni in Syria, are found throughout a large area from the shores of the Mediterranean to the Caspian Sea, and in the North Caucasus. Analogies for the gold and bronze objects found at Lchashenand Artik can be found in Ras Shamra(Ugarit) and in Mari, along the middle of the Euphrates river. Assyrian and Ugaritic documents describe the routes from the kingdom of the Hatti to Assyria used by mer
chant caravansbringing tin from the far west; roads to
the southern Caucasusbranchedout from the main caravan routes, and led from the Hatti town of Kanesh into the Assyriancities of Nineveh and Assur. At the end of the second and the beginning of the first millennium B.C., important centers of Bronze Age cul
ture appeared in the Caucasus,Iran, and the Near East, all having connections with regions producing metal ores. Along with cattle, metal objects became the main items of barter.Archaeological work in the Caucasushas revealed a number of individual cultures, outstanding in
the originality
of their artifacts and, despite
a
general
similarity of bronze wares (axes, battle axes, swords, daggers, arrowheads,spearheads), with local differences. The cattle-breeding tribes became only semi-nomadic as they took over mountainous areas, where high-altitude
pastureland provided more continuous grazing for their herds; into their hands thus fell ore-bearinglocations, so
the development of metallurgy occurred among these tribes. The most famous monument of Bronze Age culture in

the Caucasusis the Koban burial of North Ossetia. Discovered near the village of Verkhnii Koban in 1869, it consisted of numerous stone boxes in which the skeletons
lay on their side with legs drawn up, as well as a great
quantity of bronze weapons and ornaments. Very characteristic are small bronze axes of elegant shape, often with
engraved designs - animals, geometric motifs, and scenes connected with religious beliefs: one of them, for example, shows a man with a bow in his hand, battling seven snakes, which can be interpreted as a scene from an Ossetian epic recounting the struggle of the hero Amran with seven snakes. The handles of these axes are usually wood, but some are bronze. The burial contained many daggers, of two types: one
with a wooden handle, and the other cast in one piece,
with handles often decorated with small sculptured animals. The other bronze objects are numerous and varied: there are belts made of sheet bronze with figural clasps, fibulae (fasteners like safety pins), bracelets for arms and legs, pins, and beads. Of special interest are the
bronze amulets-small figures of horses, dogs, stags, rams, and birds (seldom human beings). Many of these statuettes or pendants are remarkable or their elegance and laconic forms; the decorative pendants in the shape of rams' heads with wide horns are especially
handsome (cat. no. 9). All these pieces are executed in bronze of high quality; by the late second and earlyfirstmillennium B.C., the tribes in this areaknew of iron, but it was used
only for decoration, as in the inlay of the flat belt clasp shown in color plate 2 (cat. no. 8). Since 1869 other cemeteries similar to the Koban burial have been found. Collecting Caucasian bronze
objects became a passion for many archaeologists and amateurs in Russia and western Europe, although the
careful study of the Bronze Age in the Caucasus o
began early in the twentieth century.Koban objects, s as bronze belts and axes, have been found along the nor
ern shores of the Black Sea region and up to the Dnie
area, and can also be found in burials in the south Caucasus, where there was another culture very close that of Koban.
TheCultureof Urartu
9th-beginning f the6thcenturyB.C. [Cataloguenos.10-161
During the first
half of the second millennium B.C.,
Hurrians (who had come into the Near East from north early in the third millennium B.C.) domina most of Syria and northern Mesopotamia under the c trol of Mitannian overlords. Around 1000 B.C., after fall of the Mitannian state, a Hurrian tribe, called Nairi, began to unite in northeastern Anatolia. In ninth century B.C. these tribes created a new state
the region of Lake Van in present-day Turkey, wh
immediately became a competitor of Assyria: Assyr called this state Urartu. In Urarteaninscriptions, the c ter of their territorywas called the countryof the Biain a word preservedin the name of LakeVan. The earliest written information about the Urarte occurs on monuments of the Assyrian king Shalman III who, from the first year of his reign, 860 B.C.,
uninterruptedwars against his northernneighbors.Th campaigns aredescribedin his annals and depicted on bronze gates of a temple at Balawat near Nineveh:

ressesand returningwith loot and prisoners.
Despite this opposition, the Urartean state quickly became powerful, and in the first half of the eighth cen
turyB.C. extended its rule over a wide area.
Having entered into an alliance with the small statesin northernSyria,the Urarteanstook possession of the lands
down to the western bend of the Euphratesriver,gaining control of a main route to the Mediterranean from the
southern Caucasus.Simultaneously they startedto subjugate the southern Caucasus itself, including the fertile valley of the middle Araxes river and the mountains of
Armenia, rich in copper ore and in cattle. Overcoming the resistanceof local chieftains, the Urarteansseized the land around Mount Ararat and Lake Sevan (the largest
lake in Transcaucasia,in central Armenia), and estab
lished military and administrative centers there. In 782
B.C. the Urartean king Argishti I founded Erebuni, a fortress on the northern edge of the Araxes valley, where he settled 6,600 prisoners; somewhat later he
founded Argishtihinili ( built by King Argishti ), a large city on the banksof the Araxes.
Assyria could not stand by indifferently as Urartu expanded and grew more powerful. During the reign of Argishti's son, Sarduri II (764-735), the Assyrians undertooktwo campaigns againstUrartu, in 743 and 735
B.C. In the second, they
reached and besieged
the Urar
tean capital of Tushpa. Under Sarduri II Cimmerians
are first mentioned as being present in the land of the Mannai, to the south of Lake Urmia in Iran; two groups, Cimmerians and Scythians, seem to be referred
to in Urartean and Assyrian texts, but it is not always clear whether the terms indicate two distinct peoples or
simply mounted nomads. The Assyrian royal archive, found in their capital of Nineveh, contains some remark
able documents, reports from Assyrian scouts in neigh
boring countries. The most interesting of these is a
dispatchfrom the crownprince Sennacherib,who reports that Cimmerian nomads were marching against Urartu
and had inflicted a defeat on the Urartean forces, listing
the names of the Urarteancommanderswho fell in battle.
Sargon, encouraged by this defeat to his archenemy,led an ambitious campaign against Urartu in 714 B.C. It
ended in a complete victory for the Assyrians, which is described in a long text on a clay tablet found at Assur, while scenes from the campaign, such as the plundering of the Urartean temple in Musasir, southeast of Lake
Van, are represented on the walls of the royal palace at Dur Sharrukin (Khorsabad). After the Assyrian victory of 714 B.C., the Urartean
government was reformed; the old
administrativecenters were abolished and replaced by new ones. The second rise of Urartuis connected with King RusasII, who ruled in the firsthalf of the seventh centuryB.C. The Urartean culture of this period is well known from the excavations of the Teishebaini fortress, on the hill Karmir-Blurnear Erivan, which replaced the earlier fortress, Erebuni. Objects from the treasury of Erebuni were transferred to
Teishebaini; an inscription describing the founding of the new fortress mentions that the sacred weapons
were brought in and, indeed, during the excavations
objects
with the names of the earlier Urartean kings
of the eighth century B.C. were found: shields (with in
scriptions saying they were made by Argishti I for Ere
buni), quivers (cat. no. 12), helmets, bronze cups (cat. nos. 10, 11 ), and horse trappings. The excavations at Teishebaini provided a vivid picture of life in a Urartean city of the seventh and early sixth centuriesB.C. Agriculture, cattle raising, and crafts
were all highly developed; especially important is the wide distribution of iron implements and weapons at

this site. As a result of Urarteaninfluence, iron came into common use in the southern Caucasus n the seventh and sixth centuriesB.C.
The Teishebaini excavations also produced good ex
amples of Urartean art, which had previously been known only from accidental finds and from the excavations of the fortress at Toprak-Kale, near Tushpa, the
Urartean capital. In the eighties of the past century, some bronze statuettes, originally covered with gold leaf, appeared in the possession of dealers; these proved to be parts of a Urartean ceremonial throne (or two such
thrones) that had been found by villagers at ToprakKale. The statuettes passed into various museums (The British Museum, the Louvre, the Berlin museum, the
Metropolitan Museum, the Brussels museum, the Hermi
age); among the four statuettes in the Hermitage, the
most outstanding is the small figure of a winged lion with human torso (color plate 2, cat. no. 14): the face is of white stone, with colored stone inlays. These small
figures belong to the courtly artof Urartu, similar in style to that of Assyria. The diverse finds at Teishebaini testify to Urartu's
widespread contacts: they include Egyptian amulets, Mediterranean jewelry and ceramics, Assyrian seals and bronzes, and Iranian beads and seals. Of special interest
are works indicating
the connections between Urartu and the Scythians: these consist of Scythian arrowheads
(trihedral and forked), iron akinakes (the Scythian short sword), and horse trappings-some of horn, others of bronze in the shape of griffins' or birds' heads, and cheekpieces with an animal head at one end and a hoof at the other, similar to those found as far north as the
Dnieper region. In the seventh century Urartean relations with the
Scythianswere peaceful. This worried the Assyriankings
Esarhaddonand Assurbanipal, a concern reflected in questions asked of the oracles and requests in hymn the gods. At this period the Assyrians were involved
constant struggles with the nomads to the north. T
Scyths (called Ashguzai and Ishkuzai by Esarh don) were also in the Mannean region: Esarhad mentions an Assyrian defeat in a raid led by Scythians, and the god Shamash is asked whether
Scythian king, Partatua, will remain friendly if E haddon allows his daughter to become the Scythi
wife, as Partatuahad requested. From archaeological data, from cuneiform tab and from information supplied by Herodotus, we kn the Cimmeriansand Scythiansremained in the Near E
manyyears, and participatedin the destructionof Ass
and other ancient Near Eastern centers. For insta
Babylonian chronicles of 616-609 B.C., describing fall of Assyria, tell that nomadic tribes (referred to
Umman manda ) joined the Babylonian and Med armies in the siege and capture of Nineveh in 612 B
Herodotus, in describing their siege, mentions tha
large Scythianarmyappearedunder the walls of Ninev led by Madyes, son of Protothyes (the Partatua of cuneiform sources). Also connected with the Scythians' stay in the N
East are the objects thought
to have been found at end of the Second World War in a fortress at Zawiy in Iranian Kurdistan. These pieces fall into three c
gories: Assyrian works of the eighth centuryB.C., sei
as booty; local objects; and pieces combining anc Near Eastern and Scythian styles. In the latter, one counters Near Eastern motifs-such as the adoration the sacred tree-that had.obviously lost their orig meaning, since figures that used to form a definite c
position are now arbitrarilyplaced; there are also

The earliest typically Scythian artifacts (primarily horse equipment) have been found over a wide area. They occur as far north as the Kiev areaon the Dnieper,
in the Kuban region (the northeast shore of the Black
Sea), in the northern and southern Caucasus, in central Urartu, and in Iran. Within the same territory,and even further into the Near East, have been found characteristic Scythian bronze arrowheads of the second half of the seventh century B.C. This archaeological evidence is borne out by historical recordsthat refer to the presence of nomads in the Near
East during the eighth and seventh century B.C. (It should be mentioned, however, that Assyrian and Urartean documents call these nomads by several names, and
it is not always
certain whether the terms really
indicate
distinct, identifiable groups or are meant to imply nomads in general; so this documentary evidence should
be interpreted with care.) As mentioned earlier, beginning in the second half of
the eighth century B.C., Assyrian sources refer to nomads identified as the Cimmerians; other Assyrian sources say these people were present in the land of the Mannai (south of Lake Urmia in Iran) and in Cappadocia for a hundred years, and record their advances into Asia Minor and Egypt. The Assyrians used Cimmerians in their army as mercenaries; a legal document of 679 B.C. refers to an Assyrian commander of the Cimmerian regiment ; but in other Assyrian documents they are called the seed of runawayswho know neither vows to the gods nor oaths. Scythians are apparently first mentioned at the end of the first half of the seventh century B.C., in the texts of
the Assyrian king Esarhaddon (681-668 B.C.); called Ashguzai or Ishkuzai, they are said to be in the land of the Mannai. Scholars explain their advance into
the Near East in various ways, suggesting that the mate along the north shore of the Black Sea chang thus forcing the Scythians to search for new graz
grounds, or that a constant inclination toward pillag
is a specific psychological characteristicof nomadic p
ples. Another possible explanation, however, is e nomic. The Near Eastern kingdoms had, for the m
part, switched to an economy based on agriculture w extensive irrigation, and their own cattle-breeding
replaced by the import of livestock. The Scythian tr of the northern shores of the Black Sea must have p sessed a considerable surplus of cattle and, since t
moved with great ease, began driving part of their he south of the Caucasianmountains. In exchange for ca
the Scythians
received the merchandise they
need
iron, copper, and tin, as well as textiles and jewelry. Gradually, these commercial relations may have led
less peaceful ones as barterwas replacedby seizure, w the nomads discovered their military superiorityover sedentaryfarmerswho lived on the outskirts of the N Eastern states. The Scythian invasion may also have b
encouraged by the great changes that had taken plac the political life of the ancient Near East in the sec half of the eighth century B.C., as the old states g weaker and new ones started to appear; in this in
struggle the nomads (referred to collectively as Umm manda ) played an important role.
Herodotus gives the following accountof their stay
A numerous horde of Scyths, under their king
Madyes, son of Protothyes, burst into Asia in pur suit of the Cimmerians whom they had driven ou of Europe, and entered the Median territory ....
the Scythians [had] turned out of the straigh course, and took the upper route, which is much

longer, keeping the Caucasusupon their right. The Scythians, having thus invaded Media, were opposed by the Medes, who gave them battle, but,
being defeated, lost their empire. The Scythians
became masters of Asia. After this they marchedforward with the design of invading Egypt. When they had reached Pales
tine, however, Psammetichus the Egyptian king
met them with gifts and prayers, and prevailed upon them to advance no further. On their return,
passing through Ascalon, a city of Syria,the greater part of them went their way without doing any
damage; but some few who lagged behind pillaged
the temple of Celestial Aphrodite.... The dominion of the Scythians
over Asia lasted
twenty-eight years, during which time their insolence and oppression spread ruin on every side. For besides the regular tribute, they exacted from the severalnations additional imposts, which they fixed
at pleasure; and further, they scoured the country and plundered every one of whatever they could. At length Cyaxares and the Medes invited the greater part of them to a banquet, and made them drunk with wine, after which they were all massacred. The Medes then recovered their empire, and had the same extent of dominion as before. (Book
I, 103-106.)1
The Scythians' contact with Near East is reflected in Scythian art of the late seventh to sixth century B.C.
(Many of these pieces have traditionally been dated to the sixth century B.C., which increases the discrepancy

between the first written mention of Scythiansand actual Scythian objects in this area.) The works said to have come from Zawiyeh, south of Lake Urmia, have already
been mentioned; these pieces of the late seventh and early
sixth century B.C. combine ancient Near Easternmotifs like the tree of life with Scythianones, like panthers and
reclining stags. A similar combination of Near Eastern and Scythian motifs occurson works of artfound in two earlyScythian kurgans, at Kelermes in the North Caucasusand at the Melgunov kurgan in the Ukraine. At both sites was found an iron akinakes (the Scythian short sword) whose hilt and scabbardare covered with sheets of gold. Both are decorated with representations reminiscent of
pieces
from Zawiyeh.
Some motifs seem to have lost their meaning (winged genii who fertilize the sacred tree on Assyrian and Urartean works are separate en
tities, detached from the tree), suggesting that they were copied from Urartean objects-a theory corroboratedby the way the animals' bodies are rendered: as flat designs
with minute all-over patterns. But Scythian scabbards, unlike Urartean ones, had a projection at the side by which they were attached to the belt; thus the artist, having no model to copy for this part, decorated this
projection with Scythian motifs, a reclining stag and birds' heads, executed in a purely Scythianstyle, a blocky modeling in relief with no patterning.
We do not appreciate sufficiently the role that the copying of individual elements played in ancient art. A round silver-gilt mirror found at Kelermes is another
example of such copying of foreign pieces (color plate 4, cat. no. 25). Its relationship to Ionian art was pointed
out long ago, but its technique and composition are very different: the motifs were probably copied from several
different works. Still another example is the decoration

on a ceremonial axe covered with gold leaf (color plate 7), also from Kelermes. Various animals are distributed on the axe itself and on its handle, while the sacredtree
is shown on a separatepanel from the distorted figure of
the genius; only the depiction of a reclining stag indicates the Scythianorigin of this piece, which is decorated in a manner that at first glance seems ratherodd. These Scythian objects date from the end of the seventh or the beginning of the sixth centuryB.C., the same
date as the pieces from Zawiyeh. It has been suggested that the Scythian style originated in the Near East, but it
is important to point out that, on the contrary, the socalled Scythian animal style is found over a wide territory in the steppes even by the seventh century B.C. In
the Golden Kurgan in Kazakhstan, far to the east, S. S.
Chernikov has discovered remarkable gold plaques in
the shape of panthers and reclining stags that had been used to decorate a quiver (color plate 4, cat. no. 29), as well as some bronze arrowheads of the archaic Scythian type of the seventh century B.C. (cat. no. 30). Farther east, at Tuva, M. P. Gryaznov found a bronze in the
shape of a curled-up predator,which is analogous to gold Scytho-Siberian plaques that are dated even earlier. By the time Herodotus wrote, in the middle of the fifth century B.C., the Scythians of the Black Sea area
were grouped
into a large
confederation of separate
tribes. In its most precise form, the term Scythians refers to some tribes who lived on the northern shores of the Black Sea, but the Scythianculture was shared by various tribes spread over a large territory, with similar
ways of life and close interrelations, promoted by nomadic cattle-breeding. The horse made direct communi
cation possible between people living at great distances from each other, and it is no mere coincidence that horse equipment, specifically, is similar over the whole terri
tory inhabited by tribes of the so-called Scythian cultu
According to Herodotus, in the regions of the low
Bug and Dnieper rivers lived the Callipidae (wh
Herodotus calls a Graeco-Scythianrace since the
portant Greek trading post of Olbia was nearby) and Alazonians; both tribes raised corn. Still further no

regions and must have belonged to different tribes,
though they are closely similar.
Herodotus describesthe nomad Scythians'way of l
with wagons transporting their belongings as they lowed their vast herds of cattle and horses. Although says Scythians had no fortified towns, this must ap only to nomads along the steppes, since we know Scythian fortified settlements in other regions. For

various regions and colonies of Greece, as well as gold,
silver, and copper coins), as well as objects imported from other ancient civilizations such as Achaemenid Iran
and Egypt (color plate 10, cat. nos. 67, 62). Between the fifth and third centuries B.C., the Scythians not only were in contact with the civilizations of Greece, Egypt, and the Near East, but shared a cultural
unity with many other tribes living in the steppe region of eastern Europe and Asia. In art, an indication of such
unity is the so-called animal style. Powerful, stylized, and decorative, this style is characteristicof a wide ter
ritory stretching
from Hungary to China.
It portrays
animals and birds with their most important attribute
horns, paws, hooves, jaws, beaks, ears-exaggerated or accentuated. Predatory beasts and birds were important subjects, and the animals often appear locked in combat or in one of several characteristicposes: lying with legs folded under, curled into a circle, or running. These
images probablyhad religious or magic significance: rep

A large group of objects in this exhibition comes from the extraordinary kurgans of the Altai mountains in
Siberia. The kurgans, at Tuekta, Bashadar, and Pazyryk, were built between the sixth and fourth centuries B.C. in mountainous regions difficult to reach. Immediately after the burials, water had seeped into the stone mounds and
turned to ice; this permafrost has preserved some five
thousand objects of wood, textiles, felt, leather, and fur. The antiquities from the Altai kurgans at the Hermit
age are particularly valuable since many are the most ancient examples of those arts and crafts for which time shows no mercy-an embroidered silk textile, a knotted rug, felt appliques, and leather and wooden parts of horse equipment. All the kurgans had been robbed in antiquity, but the robbers only took objects made of precious metal, leaving the rest of the contents strewn
about. The most important material comes from the Pazyrykexcavations carried out in 1929 by M. P. Gryaz
nov and S. I. Rudenko, and between 1947 and 1949 Rudenko. Under one mound at Pazyrykwas a chamber ined w
wooden logs, built in a trench about 164 feet square
a
from 13 to 23 feet deep. In the chamber was a sar phagus hewn from a single log, decoratedwith scene animal combat. The body of the dead man had b
embalmed, and on the skin of his arms, chest, and le tattoos of animals and fish can still be seen. The ch tain's wife or concubine had been buriedwith him, and
the grave had been placed clothing (cat. no 125), or ments, furniture, objects of everyday life, and mus instruments-everything that had surrounded him wh he was alive; there was also a bronze cauldron filled w
burnt hemp
seeds, corroborating
Herodotus' accoun
a Scythiancustom (Book IV, 73-75).
Everything connected with the funerary process and ritual had been placed in a trench nearthe outer w of the chamber.In Pazyrykkurgan 5, near the north w
were found bodies of richlycaparisonedhorses,a wood chariot on large wheels, a felt wall hanging (part of
funerary tent) with two pictures of a seated wom holding a branchwith a horsemanbefore her, poles fr the tent or chariot with felt swans as finials (color p 25, cat. no. 118), a remarkable woolen rug, and ot
objects. The horses of the funerary procession were and slender, and of a different breed than the small lo ones, known from common burials. They wore lavis decoratedsaddles and bridles, with strapsornamented a multitude of wooden plaques (often covered with g

Characteristicof the Tagar period are tombs in the shape of earthen kurgans, with a four-sided enclosure of vertical slabs at the bottom. Tall stones stand at the
corners of the enclosures, and often in the middle of their sides. The dead were buried in a stone box or log sarcophagus. Later in the Tagar period collective burial
vaults occur, containing up to two hundred people who were buried over a number of years.
Tagar art is marked by the so-called Scytho-Siberian
animal style. Their artistsliked to representhorses, birds,
mountain goats, wild boars, a feline predator, and stags; most often the animals are shown standing. Such repre
sentations appear on knife handles, dagger hilts, finials, battle hammers, clothing ornaments, and horse trappings. This art is monumental, decorative, and characterized by its peculiar, abbreviated stylization, which allows us to distinguish the work of Tagar artists from
similar pieces from other regions. Although Scythian traits can be detected in the works of artand the weapons
and armor, the Tagar tribes preserved their originality
more than any others of the Scythian epoch, partly because they were a settled people, rather than nomadic, and because they lived in the deep Minusinsk basin, isolated from the rest of the world-surrounded on three sides by mountains and on the north by forest. These
natural barriersprevented the mass penetration of other tribes into their territory,but did not interfere with their commerce with their neighbors. The peoples who de
veloped the Tagar culture are the last large group of Europoid settlers in Eurasia.
Further east lived peoples of Mongoloid appearance, and in the cultures of these tribes of Transbaikalia and Mongolia there are many traces of so-called Scythian traits, especially evident in the art of the animal style.
TheSarmatian ulture
1st centuryB.C.-lst centuryA.D.
[Catalogue nos. 162-165]
Contemporarywith the Scythiansand, like them, mounted herdsmen, were the Sauromatae, who lived in the steppes around the Ural mountains and the Don and Volga rivers, and who seem to link the Scythian world with that of the Sakas of Central Asia. In the third centuryB.C. the Sarmatiansdeveloped from this ancient culture, and by the second and first centuries B.C. they had conquered much of Scythia as well as the towns along the north shores of the Black Sea. Later, in the
third and fourth centuries A.D., the Sarmatians were
driven out by other nomadic tribes, such as the Huns. This exhibition includes several Sarmatian objects from the Novercherkassk Treasure (cat. nos. 163164), which were discovered by accident in the 1860s. These elaborate works are remarkablefor their striking
decorativeeffect and complicatedcompositions involving fantastic animals;manyare encrustedwith colored stones, glass, and pearls. Also in the show is a braceletfound in
1954 in a kurgan in the Volga region (cat. no. 162), which reflects a complex version of the animal style.
The
most important goal
of this exhibition is to pre
sent magnificent examples of ancient art: the sumptuous
masterpieces made by and for the Scythians, and examplesof the dramaticartfrom the ice-boundAltai tombs. The other material illustrates the relationship of these peoples with contemporary cultures and with cultures that preceded and followed them, and shows how the far-ranging contacts between the tribes of the first millennium B.C. carried this handsome, powerful art over
the vast expanse of the steppes.

The Alexandropolkurgan
P. Koliubakin [color plate 2, cat. no. 13], remained for a long time and were also exhibited in
section.)
By the end of the eighteenth century,travelersin south began to mention in their reportsthe large ancient that they encountered on their journeys: the Chertomlyk kurgan is mentioned in such an in 1781, although it was not studied until eighty later. In 1794, the scholar P. S. Pallas was commissioned to a description of the Black Sea district annexed Russia,and during his visit to the Bug riverestuaryhis was attractedby the ruins of an ancient town,
he correctly dentified as Olbia, a colony settled by
from Miletus. Systematic excavations of Olbia,
in 1901 and still continuing, have proved the great of this town-an outpost of Greek civilization
the frontiers of Scythianterritory-on Scythianculture northshores of the Black Sea.
The excavationsthat inauguratedthe studyof Scythian took place at the Kul Oba kurgan near Kerch,
important ancient city on the straits connecting the
Sea with the Sea of Azov to the north. In 1830, of a constructionproject, a stone burialvault discovered beneath the kurgan's mound. Connois
of antiquities came to the site and found a rich
of the fourth centuryB.C.-the tomb of a Scythian along with his wife and a servant. Around his
the chieftain wore a magnificent gold torque end
in figures of Scythian horsemen (color plate 19, no. 82); nearbywere other precious objects, such as an iron sword in a gold sheath and an elaboratelyemossed libation bowl (color plate 20, cat. no. 83). Like er husband, the chieftain's wife had been buried in luxurious clothes decorated with small gold ornaments,
and near her head were gold pendants representing Athena (color plate 16, cat. no. 78), copied from the famous statue of the goddess byPhidias in the Parthenon.
By her feet lay a remarkablevessel depicting Scythians
(color plates 17, 18, cat. no. 81). Under the floor of the crypt was a secret hiding place, from which comes the
massive gold plaque in the shape of a stag (color plate 15, cat. no. 77) that may have been a shield decoration.
The excavators, I. A. Stemikovskyand P. Dubrux, made a schematic drawing of the arrangement of the burial, and took the measurements of the crypt itself. In 1831 the Kul Oba objects were handed over to the Hermitage, becoming the foundation of its famous collection of
Scythian antiquities, and the imperial court granted two
thousand rubles for further exploration in Kerch.
Between 1853 and 1856 the Alexandropol kurganwas
explored; this was one of the largest Scythian mounds
in the Dnieper river region, almost seventy feet high. The excavation was undertakenbecause two bronze pole tops had accidentally been discovered there in 1851one a rather crude figure of a goddess, the other with an elegant crescent shape crowned by three birds (cat. nos. 89, 90)-but the actual burials, of the fourth and
beginning of the third century B.C., had been totally ransacked. The archaeologists did, however, find the
burialof fourteen horses
with many gold
and silver orna
ments, as well as anothergrave containing a single steed wearing a richly decoratedbridle and saddle. It had been
buried in a posture typical of animal representationsin Scythian art: its legs were drawn under the body and its head and neck stretched forward. The burial of horses
a mainstay of the Scythians'economy-is characteristicof Scythian kurgans; often many of them are buried at a single site, a custom described by Herodotus (Book IV,
71-72).

town of Maikop discussed earlier. The combinaof flint and copper tools and precious objects of ancient Near Easternorigin opened a new, little-understood
and arguments raged over the age of this tomb,
scholars suggesting dates as much as twenty-five
hundred years apart. The next year, Veselovsky examined two kurgans near the village of Novosvobodnaya
(formerly Tsarskaya), and found two dolmens of large stone slabs underneath the mounds; inside these kurgans were flint ferrules and copper tools and weapons, as well as gold and silver objects. It has now been established that the Novosvobodnaya kurgans are somewhat later than the Maikop ones-probably of the late third and early second millennium B.C.-but at that time their date
was a puzzle.
Finds in the Kuban region continued to bafflearchae
ologists. In 1903 a mining technician, D. G. Schulz, dug up four early kurgans in the village of Kelermes, which
produced extraordinarilyprecious works of art. Among the treasures were an iron sword with a gold hilt and
scabbard, with representations of Near Eastern type closely related to those on the scabbard from the Melgunov kurgan, an iron ceremonial axe mounted on a long
golden handle (color plate 7), a gilded silver mirror with unusual designs (color plate 4, cat. no. 25), and
a large gold plaque in the shape of a panther, a particularly magnificent example of Scythianart (color plate 5, cat. no. 28). The archaeologistN. I. Veselovsky was sent to Kelermes in 1904; the two kurgans he excavated
proved to have been pillaged, although they provided information about the constructionof the burial chambers, which were made of wood in the shape of a tent with a pyramidal roof: more than twenty horses were buried along the sides of one. The Kelermes kurganswere simi
lar to the Kostromskaya kurgan, which Veselovsky ex
cavated in 1897, and from which comes the golden stag (color plate 3, cat. no. 18), no less famous than the
Kelermes panther.
These early monuments of Scythian culture are tradi
tionally dated to the beginning of the sixth centuryB.C., but there are several reasons why they should probably be dated to the end of the seventh century B.C. or the turn of the seventh to sixth centuries. For instance,
objects from these early Scythian kurgans have definite relations with the remarkablepieces said to come from Zawiyeh in Iran, which combine ancient Near Eastern and Scythian decorative motifs. In addition, finds from Urartean centers such as Teishebaini (Karmir-Blur)
include Scythian arrowheads, cheekpieces, and bridle
plaques
similar to those found at Kelermes,
ceramic beads like some found in the Dnieper region and in early Scythian burials in the Mozdok region, and also objects similar to Zawiyeh ones. Important excavations took place in 1898 and 19081909 in Ulski Aul, a town near Kelermes and Kostrom
skaya. Although all the kurgans had been robbed, the archaeologistswere able to collect several interesting ex
amples of early Scythian art, such as two handsome bronze standards (color plates 6 and 8, cat. nos. 31, 33).
Under the forty-six-foot-high mound of the first kurgan was a grandiose wooden structurewith pillars in the cor
ners, and wooden hitching posts all along the sides. Lying around the posts were the skeletons of more than
three hundred and sixty horses-eloquent testimony to the vast herds owned by this nobleman'stribe. Almost every year there were new discoveries in the North Caucasusand the Kuban region, but such interesting finds from the Ukraine were rare. It seemed as if all
important kurgans had already been investigated and only pillaged tombs remained-which meant enormous

efforts might produce very modest results.
But the unexpected can happen. Archaeologists had
long noticed, on the left bank of the Dnieper river, a large kurgan that local inhabitants called Solokha. An excavation slated for 1883 did not get underway, and it was not until 1912 that N. I. Veselovsky, who often had
good luck, took over this assignment. The kurganhad clearlybeen robbed,but the archaeologists were counting not only on the fact that thieves usually left a few things behind, but also on the fact that
Scythian kurgans often contained secret compartments where the exceptionally valuable objects were hidden.
The archaeologists'
calculations proved
to be correct. Only a few finds were made the first year. The burial chamber under the mound had been ransacked,although
some gold clothing ornaments and a silver drinking cup with a Greek inscription were collected. The second year was luckier. The archaeologists uncovered another chamber, near the edge of the mound, which robbers had never discovered. It had three niches in its walls: the owner of the tomb had been buried in one of them, and the other two contained an enormous
number of gold and silver objects-magnificent examples of ancient art. On the skeleton were gold bracelets, a
torque, and clothing ornaments (cat. no. 72), some de
picting two Scythianssharing a drinking horn, in a ritual described by Herodotus. Silver vessels stood all around, and near the skeleton lay an iron sword in a wooden sheath, both covered with gold. By his head was a bronze helmet of Greek type and an extraordinarygold comb
that is rightly considered a masterpiece (color plates 12, 13, cat. no. 71). Made in the beginning of the fourth century B.C. by a Greek craftsman for Scythians, the
comb depicts a battle between two horsemen (one
whom has lost his mount) and a soldier on foot. I
secret hiding place was a massive gold libation bo completely covered with scenes of animal combat (co
plate 11, cat. no. 70). The next important discoveries in the Ukraine t
place forty years later; in 1954 A. I. Terenozhkin
plored a plundered kurgan of the fourth centuryB.C the town of Melitopol: many gold ornaments for clo ing were found in the burial of a woman, includin
curious plaque depicting a spider and an insect (co plate 30, cat. no. 178). A hidden recess containe
gorytus-a
case for bow and arrows, typically Scythi
covered with gold leaf stampedwith animal combats a scene from the life of Achilles; it was so similar to
amples from the Chertomlykand Ilyintsy kurgans tha was obvious they had been made with the same stam five years later a fourth gorytus of this type was fou within the delta of the Don river, and they all must h
been producedin the same workshop (cat. no. 186). Excavationsof Scythianburials were increased dur 1960 and 1961, when work on an extensive irrigat system was undertaken in the steppes around the Bl
Sea. During this period, archaeologistsfrom the Instit of History of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences cavatedsome threehundred kurgans. Some very interesting finds were made in 1969 1970 in the course of excavations at the Gaiman
Mogila kurgan, directed by V. I. Bidzil. A silverdrinking cup is one such find: of Greek workmanshi
represents two groups of seated Scythians, while un the handles are servants carrying leather gourds w
wine and a goose (color plate 29, cat. no. 172). I

possible that this represents some legend or event well
known to the Scythians;archaeologistsstudying Scythian
art are becoming more and more convinced that representations called scenes from the daily life of the
Scythians may be meaningful rather than simply decorative. The excavations of the Tolstaya Mogila kurgan, near the town of Ordzhonikidze, have been of special importance. They were carried out in 1971 under B. N. Mozolevskii. The main burial had been robbed, but graves of servants and horses were discovered nearby. One of the horses was wearing a frontlet identical to one
found in the Tsimbalka kurgan (excavated by
I. E.
Zabelin) with a representationof a snake-legged woman (color plate 11, cat. no. 69). In addition to gold ornaments and a gorytus, the centralgrave contained a sword in a handsome gold scabbard (color plate 30, cat. no.
170). The greatest discovery at Tolstaya Mogila, however, is
a gold pectoralof magnificentworkmanship(cover, color plates 31-33, cat. no. 171). Its three tiers of decoration
include meticulously detailed figures of Scythians and animals, each individually cast. Two Scythiansare shown making a shirt, another is milking a ewe, and a fourth holds an amphora.They are shown in the midst of their
livestock-horses, cows, sheep, goats, and a pig-while
nearbyarecreaturesranging from birds and grasshoppers
to griffins savagely tearing at horses. It is possible that this superb piece comes from the same workshop as a simpler one from the Great Bliznitsa kurgan. The detailed study of Scythian burials of the sixth century B.C. in the Ukraine has shown that there is a direct link between the Scythians and the Caucasus.
Bronze chariot finials found near the town of Romny
are quite close to those from Ulski Aul in the Caucasus,
while a Koban battle axe was found near Lubny, in the Sula river area. In the Podgortsy treasure trove in the Kiev district an engraved bronze belt of Caucasiantype was found, while a kurgan near Zhabotin village contained a Caucasian bronze vessel with handles shaped like small animal heads.
Conversely, archaeological material in the Caucasus also clearly documents the Scythianpenetration into the Near East, corroboratingHerodotus' accountof Scythian campaignsin the Near Eastand their sojournthere.There are many
burials all over the southern Caucasus that without doubt belong to the Scythianculture: they occur
in Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. As mentioned
earlier, numerous Scythianobjects, especially horse trappings, were found in the ruins of the ancient Urartean fortress Teishebaini (Karmir-Blur): the closest analogies for them come from the kurgans of the Kuban district and Scythian burials in the Ukraine. Thus the connection between the Scythians and Urartean cities in the southern Caucasus is clear, and it was apparently from these centers that iron was brought to Scythia. Modern archaeological research is being devoted not only to kurgans but also to Scythianfortified settlements and to Greek outposts where Greek civilization and
Scythiantraditions overlapped. Much study is also being devoted to the other tribeswho seem to have sharedmany elements of Scythianculture, such as the Sarmatiansand the Siberian peoples discussed earlier. Gradually such researchis clearing away the mists still shrouding these ancient peoples who left us such bold and powerful worksof art.

Urartu had a rich bronze industry, of
which many remains have survived.
Fantastic animal-human figures were
favorite motifs, and this bird with a female
torso is frequently found in Urartean and
Syrian art (the Greek siren was a similar
being). The use of female-bird forms as
cauldron handles spread from Urartu to
the west, and examples influenced by this
type have been found in Greece and Italy.

This golden stag was found lying in place
on an iron shield that it must originally
have decorated-one of the few instances in which it is absolutely certain how such
large, animal-shaped plaques were used.
The stag, one of the most popular Scythian
motifs, was possibly one of their totems;
it is customarily shown in this passive
(possibly dead) pose. The beveled form of
the surface-planes meeting
at sharp
angles-suggests that this style was
developed in some carved material such
as wood or bone.

The subject matter on this mirror combines
purely Greek compositions-such as a
winged Artemis holding two wild beasts
by the forelegs (the potnia theron,
mistress of animals) and heraldic sphinxes
-with Near Eastern motifs such as the lion and tree and with Scythian themes
like the two men fighting a griffin. The
Greek elements in this mirror are Ionian,
and it was perhaps in Asia Minor that
the artist became familiar with Greek and
Near Eastern compositions flourishing
side by side. The scheme of dividing a disk
into sectors and the lack of any thematic
organization in the decoration, coupled
with a certain crudity of style, speak
for native Scythian rather than Greek
workmanship. Payne has dated the
mirror in the middle of the 6th century
B.C. The mirror is a type common to
Siberia and China and introduced to the west from that region; the distinctive
feature is that the loop handle (now
broken off) was placed in the center of
the disk.
Mirror.The handle on the back has been brokenoff. Silver, back covered with gold

Stags and felines of symbolic significance
were considered to be appropriate

This large plaque-over 12 inches long
was found resting on iron scales of armor,
and may once have decorated a breastplate
or shield made of some perishable
material. The animal's tail and paws are
made up of other small felines. The inlays
of glass paste and stone are a minor part
of the design, but the taste for such
colorful additions increases during the
following centuries until it becomes a
major element in the art of the Sarmatians
and the Huns.

A griffin's head tops this standard, which
enclosed a bell. These objects, frequently
found in Scythian tombs, may have been
attached to chariots or carts but they
are not actually found with either vehicles

Scythian burials. It is therefore possible
that they were ceremonial objects
originally mounted on wooden shafts
and carried by hand.

The volute-krater was a Laconian invention and the shape is known both
in terracotta and bronze. In Greek bronze vessels the handles, the foot, and sometimes the rim were cast, while the body was hammered ( raised ) from sheet
metal. In contrast to other shapes like
the hydria, relatively few bronze volute
kraters have survived. Often the hammered walls of the body disintegrated,
leaving only the cast portions; parts of
the krater from which this handle comes are in Odessa.

This scabbard combines a Scythian shape,
proper for the Scythian sword, with a
scheme of decoration devised by a Greek
(see also no. 170). It is divided into three parts: a top band into which the
kidney-shaped guard of the hilt fitted; a
triangular extension that represents the
leather flap by means of which the scabbard
was attached to the belt; and the sheath proper. The artist has respected these divisions. On top he has put 2 heraldic
griffins, which are thus parallel to the
animals on the sword's pommel. In the
triangular flap he has put a very
large griffin attacking a stag, and on the
long, tapering sheath he has depicted
a battle of Greeks and Persians. The composition recalls certain Greek
architectural friezes of the late 5th-early
4th century B.C. (temple of Athena
Nike in Athens, Bassae, Trysa), which in
turn may echo the picture of the battle of
Marathon in the Painted Porch at Athens.

The shape of this libation bowl is
thoroughly Greek, as is perhaps the
execution, but the scheme of decoration
a fluid profusion that covers most of the
surface-betrays a non-Greek taste and is
closer to the Scythian preference that
rejected rigid organization. There are 56
animals in 3 zones or 7 sectors; the
lions predominate, and it is significant that
most of the victims are horses.

The group is worked in relief on both sides,
giving the illusion of being sculptured
in the round. In Western art, the direction of the victor is usually from left to right,
so the side of the comb giving the horseman
and his squire the left half of the scene is
probably the principal one. Their opponent
has been thrown off his mount, which lies helplessly on its back. Dress and armor
combine local costume with such Greek
elements as the Corinthian helmet on
the rider and the metal cuirasses.
The workmanship is purely Greek and
may go back to the last quarter of the 5th
century B.C., though some scholars have
connected the rider with the Attic tomb relief of Dexileos, which is dated 394 B.C.

This torque was made in a region and
workshop where Greek influence was not
very strong. The native element in the

protome (foreparts) of an animal.

Like the gold torque (no. 73), this gold
plaque was made in a native workshop,
the subject matter is taken from local
cults. Vases found in this kurgan allow
to date it in the third quarter of the
fourth century B.C., before the beginnin
of the Hellenistic period. The plaque's
tapering shape is awkward, but the arti
has grouped his composition along a
central axis, and has insisted on strict
frontality for all his human figures.

Among the large gold plaques that are
generally assumed to be shield emblems,
this stag occupies a special place. It
embodies important characteristics of
Scythian art, such as the shaping of
the body by sharply contrasting planes
and the elaboration of the contour into
zoomorphic shapes: the antler tips turn
into a ram's head and the tail becomes a
griffin's
head. In addition,
several more
naturalistically represented animals
have been included: a greyhound against
the stag's throat, and a lion, hare, and
griffin in relief on its body. The tines
of the antlers are nine, a number of
the greatest magical significance. The
emblematic importance of the stag is
reflected in the fact that a large unit within
the ever-shifting tribal pattern of the
steppes was that of the Sakas, whose name
meant stags.

This drinking vessel, made to resemble a
long, tapering animal horn, is a type
frequently found in Scythian tombs. Those
of gold and silver are usually made of
many pieces, ending in a small animal's
head. Scythians are often represented
drinking from such horns on Greek works
depicting scenes from nomad life (see
nos. 72,76).

The decoration follows the traditional
Persian and Greek organization of a phiale
into lobes. On the 12 employed here,
gorgons' heads are surmounted by stylized
volutes, and smaller gorgons' heads are
repeated in the spandrels. Toward the rim
24 bearded heads (which may portray
Scythians or the Cabiric deities of the
Samothracian mysteries) alternate with 48
boars' heads and 96 bees. Twelve panthers' heads along the lower border face the
other way. The omphalos in the center of
the phiale is framed by a zone decorated
with 16 dolphins accompanied by smaller
fish. Two crude suspension rings are
soldered to the rim, perhaps at a later date.

ingeniously filled the P-shape demanded by
the plaque's use as a scabbard mounting
with the two S-forms of the struggling
animals. A further attempt
at introducing
a strict geometrical structure into this
seemingly chaotic design was made by the
regular distribution of round and flame
shaped insets of colored stones, now fallen

Human figures are rare enough in the
nomads' art to make this plaque worthy
of special notice, but its subject is of
extraordinary interest in the history of
world literature. The warrior lying under
a tree with his head in a woman's lap is a
motif still living in a Hungarian folk
ballad (the Hungarians are ethnically and
linguistically descendants of steppe
nomads that came to Central Europe in the
early Middle Ages), but also featured in
the 10th-century German heroic epic
Waltharius, in Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival (about 1200), and in the Arthurian story of Sir Balin and Sir Balan
(mid-13th century). It is of special interest
that in the three latter stories this motif is connected with a hero distinguished by
carrying two swords. This plaque is one
of a pair (its companion piece, a mirror
image, is not in this exhibition): they were
probably made for a pair of matching
swords to be worn by a warrior on either
hip-which is specifically described in WIalthariusas a Hunnish custom.

Complete saddle covers like this are rarely
found, even though a great number must
once have been made. They were used over
two pillows of finely tanned leather and
felt stuffed with reindeer hair, placed, in
turn, over a square of felt on the horse's
back. Chest, belly, and tail straps held them
in position. The griffins attacking
mountain goats, in felt applique outlined
in cords, are striking examples of the
animal combat theme found in many Near
Eastern civilizations; the northern
nomads probably adopted it from the
Achaemenids of Iran, on the western borders of their grazing territory. The
nomadic version, frequent in all their
arts, pictures with remarkable impact the
ferocity of the attacking animals and
the helplessness of the attacked, shown
in a curiously contorted position. The
pendants appear to be a light-hearted
adaptation of an important eastern motif:
in China, the t'ao-t'ieh mask with two
confronting dragons forming the face of a
monster had been an ornament of cosmic
import for centuries. In the nomadic
version, horned animals, back to back,
form an animal mask from whose mouth is suspended a flower.

piece, a horse's chest strap, is made
and linen tapestry with roaring
brown, black, and white, on felt and then on the leather
strap. The formal, decorated animals and
he sawtooth borders suggest Achaemenid
ersia as a source. The weave, itself an early Near Eastern specialty, is very fine
(about 50 warps, 250 wefts per running
inch). Here the nomads are using material
from their neighbors on the west to
decorate their treasured horses.

This saddle blanket comes from the most
richly caparisoned of 9 noble horses
stretched out in full regalia in the horse
burial of kurgan 5 at Pazyryk. A
rectangle of fine, embroidered Chinese
silk-one of the earliest known-has been mounted on felt by its nomadic owners.
The secret of sericulture and the resulting
exquisitely fine fabrics and embroideries
were a much-sought-after Chinese specialty until well into the Christian era. The ornament here is typical of the Ch'u state,
centered around Hunan province in
southern China in the late Chou and Han
periods. This sophisticated southern
civilization was known for its silks, lacquers, and inlaid bronzes, all richly
and elegantly decorated. Silk was not
exported until the Han dynasty (206 B.C.
A.D. 220), so this embroidery was
probably of the sort recorded in Chinese
annals as a gift (Chinese term) or
tribute (nomad term).

Cut from felt and padded-probably with
reindeer hair-this swan has the sculptural
quality of the other northern nomadic arts
of woodcarving and metalworking. The
masterly handling of felt is characteristic
of these people. This ancient non-woven
fabric was made by stirring together a mass
of wool fibers, flattening them, and
applying pressure, moisture, and heat to
pack
and firm the resulting
fabric. Various kinds of animal fiberwere used for different grades of felt; very fine
felt made of domesticated sheep wool, for
instance, was found at Pazyryk. Though
felt is the characteristic indigenous fabric
of Central Asia, felt objects sometimes
reflect influences from civilizations on the nomads' eastern and western boundaries. This swan suggests Chinese influence or a
Chinese prototype, recalling the Chinese
minor princesses who were married off to
nomadic chieftains in order to secure peace on China's western border.

The expressively raised bridge of the nose
and the heavy nostrils and lips indicate
that these rather naturalistically carved
wooden animal heads are those of elks. Traces of red paint are still visible; their
antlers, however, are lost. The elk figures
prominently in the art of the northern
nomads; a possible reference to this might
be Tacitus's mention of the twin gods

This bowl is decorated by a relief plaque
showing a griffin felling a horse near a tree
trunk. Although the shape of the bowl
is thoroughly Greek, the decoration caters
to local taste, and the animal group is in
keeping with the Scythian repertory.

This scabbard, like the one from
Chertomlyk (no. 68), combines a Scythian
shape and decoration devised by a Greek.
The part near the hilt is decorated with
two confronted cocks, the flap with a
splendid horned lion-griffin. The sheath
portrays animal combat: an eagle-griffin
has brought down a stag; a lion and griffin
attack a wild horse; a panther pursues a
stag; and a panther confronts a lion.

Of all the superb works in gold that have
been found in South Russia, this great
pectoral is easily the most splendid. The
artist has contrasted scenes from the home life of the Scythians with the wildness
outside the encampments. In the upper
register, calves and foals are suckling; two
Scythians sew a shirt cut out of an animal
skin; a third milks a ewe; and a fourth,
shown in daring three-quarter frontal
view, closes an amphora. This scene is
framed by a kid, a goat, and a bird on
each side, and also includes a pig. The
center of the lower band is given over to
three pairs of griffins attacking horses.
These groups are flanked by lions and
panthers attacking a deer on the left and a
boar on the right. In the tapering ends of
this zone, hounds course hares and grasshoppers confront each other. The
middle zone is richly decorated with floral
ornaments, on which four birds perch.
The 48 figures were individually cast and
soldered onto the frame. Pectoralwith scenesof Scythianstending

The combination of two different heads joined back to back occurs in Scythian art
for the first time in the second kurgan of
the Seven Brothers, where the two are the head of Athena and of a lion; a comparison
with Athenian coins allows a date of
about 440 B.C. Here the head of a lion is
joined to that of a youth, almost as if the
artist remembered the common Greek motif of Heracles wearing the lion skin.
The type persists until about 370 B.C.

The gorytus-typically Scythian-is a
combination of quiver and bow-case, and
like the many scabbards made for the
Scythians, it was often covered with gold.
At least four have been found, all decorated with the same subjects: one
from Chertomlyk, another from near
Ilyintsy
(both now in Leningrad),
a third, illustrated here, in Kiev, and the fourth
from an estuary of the Don, now in
Rostov-on-Don. The animals in fighting
groups are familiar from other objects
made to Scythian taste, but the two friezes
with figures are taken from Greek
mythology and probably represent Achilles
among the daughters of King Lykomedes
on the island of Skyros.

Herodotus n he Scythians
Herodotus, he "Fatherof History,"was born n Hali
carnassus, town in Asia Minor,in the eightiesof the fifth century B.C. He lived on Samos and in Athens (where he was admitted into the circle of Pericles and becamefriendswith Sophocles),and died in the Greek colonyof Thurii n Italyaround430 B.C.
His grandiosehistoryof the decisiveeventof his cen
tury,the PersianWars, ncludesa rich varietyof infor
mationon the customs,cultures,and geographyof the ancientworld.As he collectedinformationor his book, hismany ravels ed himto EgyptandLibya, hecoastsof
Syriaand Cyprus,Mesopotamia,Asia Minor,Southern
Italyand Sicily, the islandsof the Aegean,Macedonia,
Thrace, and the Black Sea. His account of the Scythians -who had humiliated the Persian army sent out to subdue them-was basedin part on his voyage by ship along
the shore of the Black Sea, and on first-handinformation gathered in Olbia, the Greek settlement and trading post
on the fringes of Scythian territory; he must also have made several excursions on land. The value of his narrative lies in his skillful combination of personal observationswith storiestold him by others,as well as
information already compiled by other historians and
geographers whose works are now mostly lost. Incredible
as some of his stories of Scythiancustomsmayseem, many of them have been borne out by modern archaeology, and his accountremains the basisfor present-dayknowl
edge of the Scythianpeople.
1. After the taking of Babylon, an expedition was
led by Darius into Scythia.' Asia abounding in men, and vast sums flowing into the treasury, he desire seized him to exactvengeance from the Scyths,who had once in days gone by invaded Media, defeated those who met them in
the field, and so begun the quarrel. During the space of twenty-eight years,as I have before mentioned, the Scyths continued lordsof the whole of Upper Asia. They entered Asia in pursuit of the Cimmerians, and overthrew the
empire of the Medes, who till they came possessed the sovereignty. On their returnto their homes after the long absence of twenty-eight years, a task awaited them little
less troublesomethan their struggle with the Medes. They
found an armyof no small size preparedto oppose their entrance. For the Scythian women, when they saw that time went-on, and their husbands did not come back,had intermarriedwith their slaves. 2. Now the Scythiansblind all their slaves,to use them in preparingtheir milk. The plan they follow is to thrust tubes made of bone, not unlike our musical pipes, up the vulva of the mare, and then to blow into the tubes with their mouths, some milking while the others blow. They saythat they do this becausewhen the veins of the animal
are full of air, the udder is forced down. The milk thus

While he slept,his mares,whichhe hadloosedfromhis chariot o graze,bysomewonderfulchancedisappeared.
9. On waking,he went in questof them,and, after
wanderingover the whole country,cameat last to the
districtcalledthe Woodland,wherehe found in a cave a strangebeing,betweena maidenanda serpent,whose form from the buttocksupwardswas like that of a woman,while all belowwas like a snake.He lookedat herwonderingly; utneverthelessinquired,whether he
hadchanced o see his strayedmaresanywhere.Sheansweredhim, "Yes, and they were now in her keeping; butneverwouldsheconsent o givethemback,beforehe had intercoursewith her."So Heracles, o get his mares back,agreed;butafterwardsheputhimoff anddelayed
restoring
he mares,
sinceshe wishedto keep
him with
her as long aspossible.He, on the otherhand,was only anxiousto secure hem and to get away.At last, when she gave themup, she saidto him, "Whenyourmares strayed ither, t wasI whosaved hemfor you;nowyou have paid a reward; or I bear n my wombthreesons of yours.Tell me thereforewhen your sons grow up,
whatmustI dowiththem?WouldyouwishthatI should settlethemherein this land,whereofI am mistress,or
shall I send them to you?"Thus questioned, hey say, Heraclesanswered,"When heladshavegrownto man

trial, send away.Thus you will at once pleaseyourself andobeyme."
10. Hereuponhe strungone of his bows-up to that

afterhe hadgiven themto her,he wenthis way;andthe

Scythes.Then she rememberedhe instructionshe had received rom Heraces, and,in obedience o his orders, she put her sons to the test. Two of them, Agathyrsus

andGelonus,provingunequal o thetaskenjoined, heir mother entthemoutof the land;Scythes,he youngest, succeeded,and so he was allowed to remain. From Scythes, he son of Heracles,were descended he after

the motherof Scythesdid for him. Such s the taletold
bytheGreekswho dwellaroundhePontus.
11. There is also anotherdifferentstory,now to be related, n whichI ammore nclined o put faiththan n anyother.It is thatthe wanderingScythians ncedwelt

As neitherpartychoseto give way,the one determined

Beyond hesepeople,a little to the east,dwellsa distinct
tribeof Scyths,who revoltedoncefromthe RoyalScyth

When the fruit is ripe, they strain t throughcloths;the juicewhichrunsoff is blackandthick,and s calledbythenatives"aschy." hey lap thisup with theirtongues,andalsomixit withmilk for a drink;while they makethe lees, which aresolid, into cakes,and eat them insteadof meat;for theyhave butfew sheep n theircountry,n whichthere s no good pasturage.Eachof them dwells undera tree, and they coverthe treein winterwith a clothof thickwhitefelt, but take off the covering n the summer-time.No one

they do not even possessany warlikeweapons.When

whenonefliesto themforrefuge,heis safefromallhurt.
Theyarecalled heArgippaeans.
24. Up to this point the territoryof which we are
speaking s verycompletely xplored,andall thenations
betweenthe coast and the bald-headedmen are well knownto us. For someof the Scythians reaccustomed
to penetrate sfar, of whominquirymayeasilybemade, andGreeksalsogo there romthetrading-stationsn the Borysthenes, nd from the other trading-stationslong
the Euxine.The Scythianswho makethis journeycom
municatewith the inhabitantsby meansof seveninter
pretersandsevenlanguages. 25. Thusfartherefore helandis known;butbeyond
the bald-headedmen lies a regionof whichno one can
give anyexactaccount.Loftyandprecipitousmountains,
whicharenevercrossed,barfurtherprogress.The bald
mensay,but t does not seemtomecredible, hat hepeople who live in thesemountainshavefeet likegoats;and that after passingthem you find anotherraceof men, who sleep duringone half of the year.This latterstate
mentappearso me quiteunworthy f credit.Theregion east of the bald-headedmen is well known to be inhabitedby the Issedonians,but the tract hatlies to the northof thesetwo nations s entirelyunknown,except
by the accountswhichtheygive of it.
26. The Issedoniansare said to have the following customs.When a man's atherdies,all the nearrelatives
bringsheepto the house;whicharesacrificed, ndtheir fleshcutin pieces,while atthe same imethe deadbody undergoes he like treatment.The two sortsof fleshare afterwardsmixedtogether,andthewholeis servedup at

and s broughtoutyearbyyearatthegreat estivalwhich sons keep

as the Greekskeeptheirfeastof the dead.In otherrespectshe
Issedonians rereputed o be observers f justice:andit is to be remarkedhattheirwomenhaveequalauthority
with the men. Thusourknowledgeextendsas far as this
nation. 27. The regionsbeyondareknownonlyfrom the accountsof theIssedonians, ywhomthestoriesare oldof

is there accounteda prodigy;as also are earthquakes, whether heyhappen n winterorsummer.Horsesbear thewinterwell, coldasit is, butmulesandassesarequite unableto bear t; whereas n othercountriesmulesand assesarefound to endure he cold, while horses, f they standstill, arefrost-bitten. 31. With respectto the featherswhich are said by
the Scythianso fill the air,andto preventpersons rom
penetrating nto the remoterpartsof the continent,or
even having any view of those regions,my opinion is, thatin the countriesaboveScythia t alwayssnows, ess, of course, n the summer han in the wintertime.Now snow when it falls looks like feathers,as everyone is awarewho has seen it come down close to him. These northernregions,therefore,areuninhabitable y reason
of the severityof the winter; and the Scythians,with their neighbours,call the snow-flakes eathersbecause, I think,of the likenesswhichthey bearto them. I have now relatedwhatis saidof themostdistantpartsof this
continentwhereofanyaccounts given.
46. TheEuxinesea,whereDariusnowwent to war,hasnationsdwellingaround t, with the one ex
ceptionof the Scythians,moreunpolished hanthoseof
any other region that we know of. For, setting aside
Anacharsis nd the Scythianpeople, thereis not within
this regiona single nationwhich canbe put forwardas
having any
claimsto wisdom,
or whichhas produced
a
single personof anyhigh repute.The Scythiansndeed
havein one respect,andthatthe verymostimportant f all thosethatfall underman'scontrol, hown hemselves wiserthan anynationupon the face of the earth.Their
customs therwise renotsuchasI admire.Theonething of which I speak, s the contrivancewhereby heymake
it impossible or the enemywho invades hemto escape
destruction,while theythemselvesareentirelyoutof his
reach,unlessit pleasethemto engagewith him. Having
neither cities nor forts, and carryingtheir dwellings
with themwherevertheygo; accustomed,moreover, ne andall of them,to shootfromhorseback; ndliving not by husbandry uton theircattle, heirwaggonsthe only
housesthattheypossess,how cantheyfail of beingunconquerable, ndunassailableven?
47. The natureof their country,and the riversby which it is intersected, reatlyfavour this mode of re
sisting attacks.For the land is level, well-watered,and
abounding n pasture;while the riverswhichtraverset
are almostequalin number o the canalsof Egypt.Of
these I shall only mentionthe most famous and su as arenavigable o somedistance romthe sea.Theya
the Ister,whichhasfivemouths; he Tyras, he Hypa
the Borysthenes,he Panticapes,he Hypacyris,he G
rhus,andtheTanais.Thecourses f thesestreams sh nowproceed o describe. 48. The Isteris of all the riverswith which we
acquaintedhe mightiest.It nevervaries n height,
continues tthesame evelsummer ndwinter.Coun
fromthewestit is the firstof the Scythian ivers,and reasonof its being the greatest s, that it receives watersof several ributaries.Now the tributarieswh swell its flood are the following: first, on the side Scythia, hese five-the streamcalled by the Scyth
Porata,and by the GreeksPyretus,the Tiarantus, Ararus, he Naparis,and the Ordessus.The first-m tioned is a great stream,and is the easternmost f tributaries.The Tiarantus s of less volume, and m to the west.The Ararus,Naparis,andOrdessus all in
the Ister betweenthese two. All the above-mentio
aregenuineScythian ivers,and go to swell the curr of the Ister. 49. Fromthe countryof the Agathyrsicomesdo anotherriver,the Maris,which emptiesitself into same;and from the heightsof Haemusdescendwit northern ourse hreelargestreams,heAtlas,the Au and the Tibisis, and pour their watersinto it. Thr
gives it three tributaries, he Athrys, the Noes, a the Artanes,which all pass throughthe countryof CrobyzianThracians.Anothertributarys furnished
Paeonia,namely
he Scius;
his river,rising
nearMo
Rhodope,forcesits way throughthe chainof Haem
and so reachesthe Ister. From Illyria comes anot stream, he Angrus,which has a coursefrom south north,andafterwatering he Triballianplain,falls i the Brongus,which falls into the Ister. So the Iste augmentedby thesetwo streams,bothconsiderable sides all these, the Isterreceivesalso the watersof
Carpisand the Alpis, two riversrunningin a nor
direction rom the countryabovetheUmbrians.For Isterflows throughthe whole extent of Europe,ris
in the countryof the Celts19(the most westerlyof
the nationsof Europe,exceptingthe Cynetians),a
19As Herodotus plunges deeper into the Europeancontin his knowledge is less and less exact. He knows that the Dan receives two great tributariesfrom the south in the upper p of its course, but he conceives the rivers, of which he had he the Umbrians tell as running northwards from the Alps ab their country, to be identical with the great tributarieswhe the dwellers on the middle Danube spoke. The length of Nile is 4,000 miles; of the Danube, 1,760 miles.

thencerunningacross hecontinent ill it reachesScythia, whereof t washes heflanks.
50. All these streams,then, and many others, add theirwatersto swell the flood of the Ister,whichthus increasedbecomes he mightiestof rivers; or undoubtedlyif we comparehe stream f theNile withthesingle
streamof the Ister,we mustgive the preference o the
Nile, of whichno tributary iver,noreven rivulet,aug
ments the volume. The Isterremainsat the samelevel
both summerand winter-owing to the following reasons,as I believe.Duringthe winter t runsatits natural height,or a very ittle higher,becausen thosecountries thereis scarcelyany rainin winter,but constant now. Whensummer omes, hissnow,which s of greatdepth,
beginsto melt, andflows ntothe Ister,which s swelled at thatseason,not onlyby thiscausebutalsobythe rains,
which are heavyand frequentat that partof the year. Thusthevarious treamswhichgo to formthe Ister,are higher in summerthan in winter, and just so much
higher
as the sun's power
and attraction re greater;
o that hesetwo causes ounteractachother,and heeffect
is to producea balance,whereby heIsterremainsalways
at the same evel.
51. This,then,is oneof thegreatScythian ivers; he next to it is the Tyras,which rises from a great lake
separatingScythia romthe landof the Neuri, and runs with a southerly ourse o the sea. Greeksdwell at the mouthof the river,who arecalledTyritae. 52. The thirdriver s the Hypanis.This streamrises withinthelimitsof Scythia, ndhasits source n another vast lake, aroundwhich wild white horsesgraze. The
lake is called,properlyenough,the Motherof the Hy
panis.The Hypanis,risinghere, duringthe distanceof five days'navigation s a shallowstream,andthe water
sweet andpure;thence,however, o the sea, whichis a distance f fourdays, t is exceedinglybitter.Thischange is causedby its receiving nto it at that point a brook
the watersof whichareso bitter hat,although t is but a tiny rivulet, t nevertheless aintsthe entireHypanis,
which s a largestreamamong hoseof thesecondorder. The sourceof this bitter spring is on the bordersof
the ScythianHusbandmen,wherethey adjoinuponthe
Alazonians;andthe placewhere t rises s calledin the
ScythicongueExampaeus, hichmeans n ourlanguage,
the SacredWays.The spring tself bears he samename.
The Tyrasand the Hypanisapproach achotherin the
countryof the Alazonians,but afterwardsseparate, nd
leavea wide spacebetween heirstreams. 53. The fourth of the Scythianriversis the Borys
thenes.Next to the Ister, t is the greatestof them all;
and,in my judgment,t is themostproductive iver,not
merely in Scythia,but in the whole world, excepting only the Nile, with which no streamcanpossiblycompare.It hasuponits banks he loveliestandmost excel
lent pasturagesor cattle; t containsabundance f the mostdelicious ish; tswater s mostpleasant o the taste; its stream s limpid,while all theotherriversnear t are
muddy;the richestharvestsspringup along its course, andwherethe ground s not sown,theheaviestcropsof
grass;while salt forms in greatplenty about ts mouth
withouthumanaid,20 ndlargefisharetaken n it of the
sortcalledsturgeon,withoutanypricklybones,andgood for pickling.Nor arethesethe whole of its marvels.As farinland as the placenamedGerrhus,whichis distant
forty days'voyagefrom the sea,21ts course s known, and ts directions fromnorth o south;butabove hisno one has traced t, so as to saythroughwhatcountriest flows.It enters heterritory f theScythianHusbandmen afterrunning or sometime acrossa desertregion,and
continues or ten days'navigation o pass throughthe land which they
inhabit.It is the only
riverbesides he Nile the sourcesof which areunknown o me, as they are also (I believe) to all the otherGreeks.Not long before t reacheshesea,theBorystheness joinedbythe Hypanis,whichpours ts waters nto the same ake.The landthat ies between hem,a narrowpointlikethebeak
of aship, s calledCapeHippolaus.Here s atemplededi
cated to Demeter, and opposite the temple upon the
Hypanis s the dwelling-place f the Borysthenites. ut
enoughhasbeensaidof thesestreams. 54. Next in successioncomesthe fifth river, called
the Panticapes,whichhas,like theBorysthenes, course from northto south,and rises from a lake. The space
between hisriverandtheBorystheness occupiedbythe
Scythianswhoareengaged n husbandry.Afterwatering
theircountry, he Panticapeslows throughthe Wood
land,andempties tself intotheBorysthenes.
55. The sixth stream s the Hypacyris, riverrising
froma lake,andrunningdirectly hrough hemiddleof the NomadicScythians.t falls intothe seanearthe city
of Carcinitis,eavingtheWoodlandandtheRace-course of Achillesto the right. 56. The seventh river is the Gerrhus,which is a
branch hrownout by the Borysthenes t the pointwhere
the courseof that stream irstbeginsto be known,the region called by the same name as the streamitself, Gerrhus.Thisriveron itspassage owards heseadivides

Palus Maeotis,wherebythe countryof the RoyalScythians is divided from that of the Sauromatae.The Tanaisreceives he watersof a tributary tream,called
the Hyrgis.

Hestiais calledTabiti,Zeus (veryproperly,n myjudg

Aphrodite Artimpasa, and Poseidon Thamimasadas.
They use no images, altars,or temples,except in the worshipof Ares;butin his worship hey do usethem.

him. No fireis lighted,there s no consecration, ndno
pouringoutof drink-offerings;utdirectly hatthebeast

61. As Scythia, owever, s utterlybarren f firewood,
a planhashadto be contrivedorboilingtheflesh,which
is the following. After flayingthe beasts,they takeout
all the bones, and (if they possesssuchgear) put the
flesh nto boilersmade n thecountry,whicharevery ike

forfeits all claim if he does not producea head. In orderto stripthe skull of its covering,he makesa cut
roundthe head abovethe ears,and, layinghold of the scalp,shakes he skullout;thenwiththe ribof anox he
scrapes he scalpcleanof flesh,and softeningit by rub
bing between he hands,usesit thenceforth s a napkin.
The Scyth s proudof thesescalps,andhangs hemfrom
his bridle-rein;he greater he numberof suchnapkins
that a man can show, the more highly is he esteemed
among them. Many make themselvescloaks,like the
sheepskins f ourpeasants,bysewinga quantity f these
scalps ogether.Others laythe rightarmsof theirdead
enemies,andmakeof theskin,which s stripped ffwith
the nailshanging o it, a covering or theirquivers.Now
theskinof a man s thickandglossy,andwould n white
ness surpassalmostall otherhides. Some even flaythe
entire body of their enemy, and, stretching t upon a frame,carryt aboutwiththemwherever heyride.Such are he Scythian ustomswith respect o scalpsandskins.
65. The skullsof theirenemies,not indeedof all, but
of those whom they most detest,they treat as follows.
Having sawn off the portionbelow the eyebrows,and
cleanedouttheinside, heycover heoutsidewithleather. When a manis poor,this is all thathe does;butif he is
rich,he alsolines the insidewithgold: in eithercase he skull is used as a drinkingcup. They do the samewith
the skullsof theirown kith andkin if theyhavebeenat feud with them,andhavevanquishedhemin the presence of the king. When strangerswhom they deem of anyaccount ometo visit them,theseskullsarehanded
round,
and the host tells how that thesewere his relationswho madewaruponhim, andhow thathe got the betterof them; all this being looked upon as proof of
bravery. 66. Oncea year he governorof eachdistrict,at a set
placein his own province,mingles a bowl of wine, of
whichall Scythians avea rightto drinkby whomfoes havebeenslain;whiletheywhohaveslainno enemyare notallowed o tasteof thebowl,butsit aloofin disgrace. No greater hame hanthis canhappen o them.Suchas have slain a very large numberof foes, have two cups insteadof one, and drink rom both. 67. Scythiahas an abundanceof soothsayers,who foretell the future by means of a numberof willow wands.A large bundleof thesewands is broughtand laid on the ground.The soothsayerunties the bundle, andplaceseachwandbyitself, at thesame imeuttering
his prophecy: hen,whilehe is still speaking,he gathers

apieceof thisbark,and,splitting t intothree trips,keep
twining the strips abouttheir fingers, and untwining
them,while theyprophesy.
68. Wheneverthe Scythianking falls sick,he sends forthethree oothsayersf mostrenownatthetime,who comeandmaketrialof theirartin the mode abovede
scribed.Generally hey say that the king is ill, because
suchor sucha person,mentioninghis name,has sworn
falselybythe royalhearth.This is theusualoathamong
the Scythians,when they wish to swearwith verygreat solemnity.Then the man accusedof having forsworn
himself is arrestedand broughtbefore the king. The
soothsayersell him that by their art it is clearhe has sworna false oathbythe royalhearth,andsocaused he illness of the king-he deniesthe charge,protests hat he hasswornno falseoath,andloudlycomplains f the wrong done to him. Upon this the king sends for six
new soothsayers,
who try
the matter by soothsaying.

The mode of theirexecution s the following: a waggon is loaded with brushwood,and oxen are harnessed o it; thesoothsayers, iththeirfeettiedtogether, theirhandsboundbehindtheirbacks,andtheirmouths gagged, are thrust into the midst of the brushwood;

While thusemployed,he wasnoticedbyone of the Scythians,who went andtold king Sauliuswhat he had seen. Then king Sauliuscamein person,and when he perceivedwhat Anacharsiswas about,he shot at him with an arrowand killed him. To this day, if you ask
the ScythsaboutAnacharsis,hey pretend gnoranceof
him, becauseof his Grecian ravelsandadoptionof the
customsof foreigners. learnt,however, rom Tymnes, the steward f Ariapeithes,hatAnacharsiswaspaternal

Gnurus,who was the son of Lycusandthe grandsonof
Spargapeithes.f Anacharsiswere reallyof this house,

24 Cybeleor Rhea, whose worship passed from the Phrygians
to the Ionian Greeks.
77. I haveheard,however,anotherale,verydifferent
fromthis, whichistold bythe Peloponnesians:heysay, that Anacharsiswas sent by the king of the Scyths o make acquaintancewith Greece-that he went, and on his returnhomereported,hattheGreekswere all occu
pied in the pursuitof everykind of knowledge,except the Lacedaemonians;ho, however,aloneknewhow to conversesensibly.A silly tale, this, which the Greeks have inventedfor their amusementThere is no doubt that Anacharsis uffereddeathin the mode alreadyrelated,on accountof his attachmento foreign customs, andtheintercoursewhichhe held with theGreeks.
78. Scylas,likewise, the son of Ariapeithes,many years ater,metwith almost he verysamefate. Ariapei
thes, the Scythianking, had severalsons, amongthem this Scylas,who was the child,not of a nativeScyth,but of a womanof Istria.Bredup by her, Scylasgained an acquaintance ith the Greeklanguageandletters.Some
time afterwards,Ariapeitheswas treacherouslylain by Spargapeithes,ing of the Agathyrsi;whereuponScylas succeededo the throne,andmarried ne of his father's wives,a womannamedOpoea.This Opoeawasa Scythian by birth,and had broughtAriapeithesa son called Oricus.Now whenScylas oundhimselfkingof Scythia, ashe disliked he Scythicmodeof life, andwasattached, by his bringingup, to the mannersof the Greeks,he madeit his usualpractice,wheneverhe camewith his
army o thetownof the Borysthenites, ho, accordingo
their own account,are colonistsof the Milesians,-he madeit his practice, say,to leavethe armybeforethe city, and, having enteredwithin the walls by himself,
and carefullyclosedthe gates,to exchangehis Scythian dressfor Greciangarments,and in this attireto walk aboutthe marketplace,withoutguardsor retinue.The
Borysthenites ept watchat the gates, that no Scythian
might see the king thus apparelled.Scylas,meanwhile,
lived exactlyas the Greeks,andevenoffered acrificeso the gods according o the Grecianrites.In this way he
would pass a month, or more, with the Borysthenites,
afterwhichhe wouldclothehimself again n his Scyth
ian dress,andso takehis departure.This he did repeat
edly,andevenbuilthimselfa house n Borysthenes, nd
marrieda wife therewho was a nativeof theplace.
79. But when the time came that was ordained o bringhim woe, the occasionof his ruinwas the following. He wanted o be initiated n the ritesof theBacchic
Dionysus,and was on the pointof obtainingadmission
to therites,whenamoststrange rodigyoccurredohim.

timeback, n the cityof the Borysthenites, buildingof

stooda numberof sphinxesandgriffinscarved n white
marble,wasstruckbylightningfromon high, andburnt
to theground.Scylas,nevertheless,wenton, andreceived the initiation.Now the Scythiansare wont to reproach the Greekswith theirBacchanalrage, andto saythatit is not reasonable o imaginethereis a god who impels men to madness.No sooner,therefore,was Scylas nitiated in the Bacchicmysteries hanone of the Borysthe
nites went and carried he news to the Scythians.
"You Scyths aughat us," he said, "becausewe ravewhenthe god seizes us. But now our god has seized upon your king, who raves ike us, and is maddenedby the influence. If youthinkI do not tell you true,comewith me, andI will showhim to you."The chiefsof the Scythians
went with the man accordingly,and the Borysthenite, conducting hem into the city, placedthem secretlyon one of the towers. PresentlyScylaspassedby with the bandof revellers,ravinglike the rest,and was seen by the watchers.Regarding he matteras a verygreatmis
fortune,they instantlydeparted,
andcameand told the armywhatthey had witnessed.
80. When, therefore,Scylas,after leaving Borysthenes, was aboutreturninghome,the Scythiansbrokeout into revolt.Theyput at theirhead Octamasadas,randson (on the mother'sside) of Teres.Then Scylas,when he learnedthe dangerwith which he was threatened, and the reasonof the disturbance,made his escapeto
Thrace.Octamasadas,iscoveringwhitherhe had fled, marchedafterhim, and had reached he Ister,when he was met by the forcesof the Thracians.The two armies

butbefore heyjoined

armies."Sitalcessent this message o Octamasadas y a herald,and Octamasadas, ith whom a brotherof Sital

surrendered is own uncle to Sitalces,and obtained n exchangehis brotherScylas.Sitalcestook his brother
with him and withdrew; but Octamasadasbeheaded

taintheirown customs,andthusseverelydo theypunish
suchas adoptforeignusages.

85. When Darius,on his march rom Susa,reached
theterritory f Calchedon n theshoresof theBosporus, where he bridgehadbeenmade,he tookshipandsailed
thenceto the Cyaneanslands,which, according o the Greeks,oncefloated.He took his seatalso in the temple andsurveyedhe Pontus,which s indeedwell worthyof
consideration. here s not in the worldanyotherseaso wonderful: it extends in length 1,280 miles, and its breadth, t the widestpart, s 380 miles.28Themouth s
but one-halfmile wide, and this strait,calledthe Bosporus,and acrosswhichthe bridgeof Dariushad been
thrown,
s fourteenmilesin length,29 eaching
romthe
Euxineto the Propontis.The Propontis s sixty miles
across,and 160 miles long.30Its watersflow into the Hellespont,the length of which is fifty miles, and the
widthnomore han1,400yards.31The Hellespontopens into thewide seacalled he Aegean. 86. The mode in which these distanceshave been measureds the following. In a long day a vessel gen
erallyaccomplishes bout70,000 fathoms, n the night
60,000. Now from the mouthof the Pontus o the river Phasis,whichis the extremelength of this sea,is a voy

where the Pontus s widerthan at anyotherplace,is a sail of threedaysandtwo nights;whichmakes330,000

28These measurementsare extremelyincorrect.The distance from the mouth of the Bosporus
to the Phasis is little more than 630 miles. Again, the distance across from the Thermodon to the Sindic peninsulais about 270 miles.
29 This is under the true length, which is about sixteen miles.
30 The Propontis is nearer forty-three miles across and 110 miles long. 31 The length is about forty miles; Herodotus' width is correct.
32These figures are given in miles in the preceding chapter. It will be noted that Herodotus regularly overestimates ships'
speeds.

by Mandrocles Samian.He likewisesurveyed he Bos

marble,whereuponhe inscribed he namesof all the
nationswhich formed his army-on
the one pillar

from conjecture, alf-way
between he city
of Byzantium ndthe templeat the mouthof the strait. 88. Darius was so pleased with the bridge thrown across he straitby the SamianMandrocles,hat he not
only bestoweduponhim all the customary resents,but gavehimtenof everykind.Mandrocles, ywayof offering firstfruitsromthesepresents, auseda picture o be paintedwhich showed the whole of the bridge, with

33It is commonly supposed that Herodotus fell here into a very gross mistake, since the Sea of Azov is not now much more than one-twelfth of the size of the Euxine; but it is possible that Lake Maeotis may have been very greatly larger in the time of Herodotusthan it is at present.

marched through Thrace; and happening upon the

nearthe cityof Aenus. 91. Here then, on the banksof the Tearus,Darius stoppedand pitchedhis camp.The rivercharmedhim
so, thathe causeda pillarto beerected n thisplacealso,
with an inscription
o the following effect,
"Thefountains of the Tearusaffordthe best and most beautiful waterof all rivers:theywerevisited,on his march nto Scythia,by the bestand most beautifulof men, Darius,
son of Hystaspes,king of the Persians, ndof thewhole continent."Suchwas the inscriptionwhich he set up at
thisplace. 92. Marchinghence,he came o a secondriver,called
the Artiscus,which flows throughthe countryof the Odrysians.Here he fixed upon a certainspot, where
every one of his soldiers should throw a stone as he passed by. When his orderswere obeyed,Dariuscontinuedhis march, eavingbehindhim greathills formed

nor are governedby any laws. They are nomads,and their dress is Scythian;but the language which they speak s peculiar o themselves.Unlike anyothernation
in theseparts, heyarecannibals.
107. TheBlack-cloaks ear,all of them,blackcloaks, and from this derivethe namewhich they bear.Their customsareScythic. 108. The Budini are a large and powerful nation: theyhaveall deep blueeyes,and brightredhair.There is a city in theirterritory, alledGelonus,whichis surroundedwith a lofty wall, four miles each way, built entirelyof wood. All thehouses n the placeandall the templesareof the samematerial.Herearetemplesbuilt in honourof the Greciangods, and adornedafter the
Greekfashion with images, altars,
and shrines,
all in wood.Thereis even a festival,held everythirdyear, n honourof Dionysus,at which the nativesfall into the Bacchicfury. For the fact is that the Geloni were an
ciently Greeks,who, being driven out of the tradingportsalongthecoast, ledto theBudiniandtookup their abodewiththem.Theystill speaka languagehalf Greek,
half Scythian. 109. The Budini, however, do not speak the same languageas the Geloni, nor is their mode of life the
same.Theyarethe aboriginal eopleof thecountry, nd are nomads;unlike any
of the neighbouring

eat lice.40The Geloni, on the contrary, re tillersof the
soil, eatbread,havegardens,andboth n shapeandcomplexionarequitedifferent rom theBudini.TheGreeks notwithstandingall theselatterGeloni, but it is a mistake to give them the name. Their country s thickly plantedwith trees of all mannerof kinds. In the very woodiestpart s a broaddeep ake,surroundedbymarshy groundwithreedsgrowingon it. Hereottersarecaught, and beavers,with anothersort of animalwhich has a square ace.With the skinsof this lastthenativesborder their eathercloaks:andtheirtesticlesprovidea remedy,
fordiseases f thewomb. 110. It is reportedof the Sauromatae,hatwhenthe
Greeksfought with the Amazons,whom the Scythians callOiorpata rman-slayers,sit maybe rendered,Oior
beingScythicorman,andpata orto slay-it is reported,
I say, that the Greeksafter gaining the battle of the

howeverthey were quite strange o ships, and did no

went ashore, and proceededby land towardsthe in
habitedregions; he firstherdof horseswhichthey fel

to plundering he Scythianerritory. 111. The Scythscould not tell what to makeof th attackupon them-the dress,the language,the natio
itself, werealikeunknown-whencethe enemyhadcom
even,was a marvel.Imagining,however, hattheywer all men of aboutthe same age, they went out again
them, and fought
a battle. Some of the bodies of th slain fell into theirhands,whereby hey discovered h
truth.Hereupon heydeliberated, ndmadea resolve
kill no moreof them,butto sendagainst hema detac mentof theiryoungestmen, asnearas theycouldgue
equalto the womenin number,with ordersto encam
in their neighbourhood, nd do as they saw them do
whenthe Amazonsadvancedagainst hem,theyweret
retire,and avoid a fight-when they halted,the youn men were to approachand pitch their camp near th
campof the enemy.All this theydid on account f the
strongdesire o obtainchildren rom so notablea race
112. So the youth departed,and obeyed the orde
which they had been given. The Amazonssoon foun
out that they had not come to do them any harm,an so they on their part ceasedto offer the Scythiansan
molestation.And now day after day the camps a
proachednearerto one another;both partiesled th
same life, neitherhaving anythingbut their armsan horses,so that they were forcedto support hemselv
by huntingandpillage. 113. The Amazons scatteredby ones and twos noon,wandering ff to relieve hemselves.The Scythia
noticedthis and did likewise;one of them attackeda

so, andthe womankeptherword.When the restof t

114. The two campswere then joined in one, each Scythianhaving the Amazonwith whom he first had intercourse s his wife. The men were unableto learn the tongueof the women,but the women soon caught up the tongueof the men.Whentheycouldthusunderstandone another, he Scythsaddressed he Amazons in these words, "We have parents,and properties, et us thereforegive up thismodeof life, andreturn o our nation,andlive with them.You shallbeourwivesthere nolessthanhere,andwe promiseyoutohaveno others." But the Amazonssaid, "We could not live with your women-our customsarequitedifferent romtheirs.To drawthe bow,to hurlthe javelin,to bestride he horse, these are our arts-of womanlyemploymentswe know
nothing.Yourwomen,on the contrary, ononeof these
things;but stayat home in their waggons,engagedin womanish asks,andnevergo out to hunt,or to do any
thing.We shouldneveragree ogether.But if youtruly wish to keepus as yourwives, andwouldconductyourselves with strict justicetowardsus, go you home to
yourparents,bid them give you yourinheritance, nd thencomeback o us, andletus andyoulive togetherby ourselves."
115. Theyouthsapproved f theadvice,and ollowed it. They went and got the portionof goods which fell to them,returnedwith it, andrejoined heirwives,who thenaddressedhem n thesewordsfollowing, "We are ashamed, ndafraid o live in thecountrywherewe now are.Not onlyhavewe stolenyou fromyour athers,but
we have done great damage o Scythiaby our ravages. As you
like us for wives, grant
the request
we makeof you.Letus leavethis countryogether,andgo anddwell
beyond heTanais."Againtheyouths omplied.
116. Crossing he Tanaisthey journeyed astwarda distanceof three days' marchfrom that stream,and again northwarda distanceof three days'marchfrom LakeMaeotis.Heretheycame o the countrywherethey now live, and tookup theirabode n it. The womenof the Sauromatae ave continuedfrom that day to the
present, to observe their ancient customs,frequently
hunting on horsebackwith their husbands,sometimes
evenunaccompanied;n wartakingthe field;andwear
ing the verysamedressasthe men.
117. The Sauromatasepeakthe languageof Scythia,
but havenevertalked t correctly,because he Amazons
learnedit imperfectlyat the first. Their marriage-law
laysit down, thatno girl shallwed till she has killed a
manin battle.Sometimest happens hat a womandies
unmarried t an advancedage, having neverbeen able
in herwholelifetimeto fulfil the condition.
118. The envoys of the Scythians,on being introducedinto the presenceof the kings of these nations, who were assembled o deliberate,made it known to them,thatthe Persian,aftersubduing he whole of the othercontinent,had throwna bridgeover the straitof the Bosporus,and crossed nto the continentof Europe, wherehe hadreduced he Thracians, ndwasnowmak
ing a bridgeoverthe Ister,his aimbeingto bringunder
his sway
all Europe
also. "Standnot aloof then from this contest," heywent on to say, "looknot on tamely while we are perishing-but makecommoncausewith
us, andtogether et us meetthe enemy.If yourefuse,we
mustyieldto thepressure, ndeitherquitourcountry, r

of the Thracians avebeenbroughtunderhis sway,and among hemevenournext neighbours,he Getae." 119. Theassembledprincesof thenations,afterhearing all that the Scythianshad to say, deliberated.At the end opinionwas divided-the kings of the Geloni, Budini, and Sauromataewere of accord,and pledged
themselves o give assistance o the Scythians;but the
Agathyrsianand Neurian princes, together with the
sovereignsof the Man-eaters,he Black-cloaks, ndthe Tauri,repliedto their requestas follows, "If you had
not been the firstto wrongthe Persians,and begin the
war,we shouldhavethought he requestyoumakejust;
we should then have compliedwith your wishes, and
joined our armswith yours.Now, however,the case
standsthus-you, independently f us, invaded he land
of the Persians,andso long as God gaveyouthepower,
lorded it over them: raisedup now by the sameGod,
they are come to do to you the like. We, on our part,
did no wrongto thesemen in the formerwar,andwill not be the firstto commitwrong now. If they invade
our land, and begin aggressionsupon us, we will not
sufferthem;but, till we see this come to pass,we will
remainat home.Forwe believe hatthe Persiansarenot

cometo attackus, butto punishthosewho areguiltyof firstinjuring hem." 120. When this replyreached he Scythians,hey re
solved,astheneighbouring ations efused heiralliance, thattheywouldnot openlyventureon anypitchedbattle with the enemy, but would retirebeforethem, driving off theirherds,chokingup all the wells and springsas
they retreated,and leaving the whole countrybare of
forage.They
divided hemselvesntothreebands,oneof
which, namely that commandedby Scopasis,it was
agreedshould be joined by the Sauromatae, nd if the
Persiansadvancedn the directionof the Tanais,should retreatalong the shoresof LakeMaeotisand makefor
that river;while if the Persiansretired, hey shouldat once pursueand harass hem. The two otherdivisions,
the principalone underthe commandof Idanthyrsus,
andthe third,of whichTaxaciswas king, wereto unite in one, and, joined by the detachments f the Geloni andBudini,were,like the others, o keepat thedistance
of a day'smarch rom the Persians, alling backas they advanced, nddoingthesameastheothers.At first, hey
were to takethe directionof the nationswhichhad refusedto jointhe alliance,andwereto draw hewarupon
them: that so, if they would not of theirown free will
engage in the contest,they might by these means be
forced ntoit. Afterwards,t wasagreed hattheyshould retire nto theirown land,and,should t on deliberation
appearo themexpedient, oinbattlewiththeenemy.
121. When thesemeasureshad been determined n, the Scythianswentout to meetthe armyof Darius,send
ing on in front as scoutsthe fleetestof theirhorsemen.
Theirwaggons,wherein heirwomenandtheirchildren
lived, and all their cattle,exceptsucha numberas was
wanted or food, whichtheykeptwith them,weremade
to precede hem in theirretreat,and departed,with or
dersto keepmarching,withoutchangeof course, o the north. 122. The scoutsof the Scythians ound the Persian host advanced hreedays'march rom the Ister,andimmediately ookthe lead of themat thedistance f a day's
march,encamping romtimeto time, anddestroying ll
thatgrewon the ground.ThePersiansno soonercaught
sightof the Scythian orsethantheypursuedupontheir
track,while the enemyretiredbeforethem.The pursuit of the Persianswas directed owards he single division of the Scythianarmy,and thus theirline of marchwas
eastwardtowardsthe Tanais. The Scythscrossedthe river,andthePersiansafterthem,still in pursuit. n this
waytheypassed hrough he countryof the Sauromatae,
andentered hatof theBudini. 123. As long as the marchof the Persianarmy ay
throughthe countriesof the Scythians nd Sauromat there was nothing which they could damage,the lan beingwasteandbarren; uton entering heterritories the Budini, they cameupon the wooden fortressabo mentioned,whichwasdesertedbyitsinhabitantsnd e
quiteemptyof everything.This placethey burntto th ground;and having so done, againpressed orwardo the trackof the retreatingScythians,ill, havingpass

four great streamsflow. These rivers all traverseth
countryof the Maeotians,and fall into LakeMaeot
Their namesarethe Lycus, he Oarus,the Tanais,an

124. WhenDariusreachedhedesert,hepaused ro his pursuit,andhaltedhis armyupontheOarus.Hereh
built eight large forts, at an equal distancefrom on
another,eight miles apartor thereabouts,he ruins o

Darius,seeingnothingmoreof them,left his fortsha
finished,and returned owardsthe west. He imagin that the Scythianswhom he had seen were the enti
nation,andthattheyhadfledin thatdirection.
125. He now quickenedhis march, and enteri

attempt,it would be resisted by force of arms. The
Agathyrsithen proceededto the frontier, to defend
theircountryagainst he invaders.As for the otherna
tions, the Black-cloaks,he Man-eaters, nd the Neuri, insteadof defendingthemselves,when the Scythsand Persiansoverran heir lands, they forgot their threats, andfled away n confusion o the deserts ying towards the north. The Scythians,when the Agathyrsi orbade themto entertheir country,refrained;
and led the Persiansback romtheNeuriandistrict ntotheirownland. 126. This had gone on so long, andseemedso inter
minable,that Darius at last sent a horseman o Idan
thyrsus, he Scythianking, with the following message, "Strangeman, why do you keep on flying beforeme,
whentherearetwothingsyoumightdo so easily? f you deemyourselfableto resistmyarms,ceaseyourwanderings and come, let us engage in battle.Or if you are
conscioushatmystrength s greater hanyours-even so youshouldcease o runaway-youhavebutto bringyour lord earthand water,and to come at onceto a conference.
127. To this messageIdanthyrsus,he Scythian ing, replied,"Thisis my way, Persian.I neverfear men or
fly from them. I have not done so in timespast,nordo
I now fly from you.There s nothingnew or strange n what I do; I only follow my commonmode of life in peacefulyears.Now I will tell youwhy I do not at once join battlewith you. We Scythianshave neithertowns nor cultivated ands, which might induceus, through fearof theirbeing takenor ravaged, o be in anyhurry
to fightwith you. If, however,you mustneedscometo
blows with us speedily, look you now, there are our fathers'tombs-seek them out, and attempt o meddle
withthem-then youshallseewhetherornowe will fight
with you. Till you do this, be sure we shall not join battle,unless t pleasesus. Thisis myanswer o thechal

callingyourselfmylord,I say o you,'Gohowl.' " (This
is whatmenmeanby the Scythianmodeof speech.) So
theheralddeparted, earing hismessage o Darius. 128. When the Scythiankings heard the name of
slaverythey were filled with rage, and despatched he
divisionunder Scopasis o which the Sauromataewere
joined, with ordersthat they should seek a conference
with the Ionians,who hadbeenleft at theIster o guard the bridge.Meanwhile he Scythianswho remainedbe
hind resolvedno longerto lead the Persianshitherand thitherabout heircountry,butto fall uponthemwhen
evertheyshouldbeattheirmeals.Sotheywaited ill such times, and then did as they had determined. n these
combatshe Scythian orsealwaysputto flightthehorse

which greatly
aided the Persians,and was of equal disservice o the Scyths, n theseassaultson the Persiancamp.This was
thebraying f theassesandthe appearancef themules.
For,as I observedbefore,the landof the Scythians roducesneitherassnormule,andcontainsno singlespecimenof eitheranimal,byreasonof thecold.So,whenthe
assesbrayed, hey frightenedthe Scythian avalry;and often, in the middleof a charge, he horses,hearing he noise made by the asses,would take fright and wheel
round,prickingup theirears,andshowingastonishment.
Thiswasowingto theirhavingneverheard he noise,or seentheform,of the animalbefore:andit wasnotwithoutsome ittleinfluence n theprogress f thewar.
130. The Scythians,when they perceived signs that the Persianswere becomingalarmed,took
stepsto inducethemnot to quit Scythia,n the hope, if
theystayed, f inflictingonthemthegreaternjury,when theirsuppliesshouldaltogether ail. To effectthis, they wouldleavesomeof theircattleexposedwiththe herds

whereuponheywouldbehighlyelated.
131. This they did several imes,until at last Darius was at his wits'end;hereonthe Scythian rinces,under
standinghow matters tood,despatched heraldto the Persiancampwith presents or the king: these were, a
bird,amouse,a frog,andfivearrows.ThePersians sked the bearer o tell themwhatthesegifts mightmean,but he madeanswer hathe had no ordersexcept o deliver
them, and returnagainwith all speed. If the Persians were wise, he added,they would find out the meaning for themselves.So when they heard this, they held a councilto consider he matter. 132. Darius gave it as his opinion, that the Scyths intendeda surrender f themselvesand their country, both andandwater, ntohishands.Thishe conceivedo be the meaningof the gifts, because he mouse is an inhabitant f the earth,and eatsthe samefood as man,

whilethe frog passeshis life in the water; he birdbears a greatresemblanceo the horse,and the arrowsmight
signify the surrender f all their power.To the expla
nationof Darius,Gobryas, ne of the sevenconspirators againstthe Magus,opposedanotherwhich was as fol
lows, "Unless,Persians,you can turninto birdsand fly up into the sky, or becomemice and burrowunderthe
ground,ormakeyourselvesrogs,andtakerefuge n the fens, youwill nevermakeescape romthis land,butdie
piercedby ourarrows."Suchwere the meaningswhich
thePersiansassigned othegifts. 133. The single divisionof the Scyths,which in the
earlypartof the warhad beenappointed o keepguard
aboutLakeMaeotis,andhadnowbeensentto get speech of the Ioniansstationedat the Ister,addressedhem,on
reaching he bridge,in thesewords,"Menof Ionia,we bringyoufreedom, f youwill onlydoaswerecommend. Darius,we understand,njoinedyouto keepyourguard

Tarryhere the appointed ime, and at the end go your

Ionians to do as they desired, the Scythianshastened
backwith all possiblespeed.
134. Afterthe sendingof thegifts to Darius, hepart of theScythian rmy,whichhadnotmarchedotheIster, drew out in battle arrayhorse and foot42againstthe

might have compelled them to a general engagement.
Persians,and seemedaboutto cometo an engageme But as they stoodin battlearray, t chanced hata ha startedup betweenthem and the Persians,and set
running;when immediatelyall the Scythswho saw rushedoffin pursuit,withgreatconfusion,and oudcri
andshouts.Darius,hearing henoise,inquired he cau of it, and was told that the Scythianswere all engag in huntinga hare.On thishe turned o thosewithwho
he waswontto converse,
ndsaid,"Thesemendoinde
despiseus utterly:andnow I seethatGobryaswasrig about heScythian ifts. As, therefore,hisopinion s no

135. So Gobryasadvised; and when night cam Darius followed his counsel, and leaving his sick so diers, and those whose loss would be of least accou with the asses also tetheredaboutthe camp, march
away.Theasseswere eft thattheirnoisemightbehear
the men, reallybecausethey were sick and useless,b underthe pretense, hat he was aboutto fall upon th

136. When daydawned,the men who had beenle

spoke as befittedtheir situation.The enemyno soon
heard,than they quicklyjoined all their troopsin on

The horseman, mastering a beautiful animal and towering over the man walking on his own feet, had a traditional sense of superiority and felt little more than
contempt for the digger of the soil. In primitive societies, when the horseman was a herder, the two life styles-that
of nomadic herdsman and peasant behind his ploughwere considered mutually exclusive. This age-old antagonism showed itself even as late as the range wars of the American West, when cowhands fought homesteaders. On the more romantic side, the dashing horseman made a deep impression on those outside of his culture.
The centaur, the Amazon warrior-maiden,the Hun, the Tartar of the Golden Horde, the medieval knight in
shining armor, the Saracen, the dazzling Napoleonic hussar and cuirassier,the Plains Indian and the cowboy under the big blue sky, all were looked upon with a mixture of awe and a delicious shudder that became greaterthe more remote they becamein time and distance. The horsemen par excellence of classical antiquity were the Scythians,who lived on the plains north of the Black Sea beyond the borders of Greek civilization.
Roaming the steppes east of the Scythians, were tribes that Herodotus called the Sauromatae,who were thought
to be the offspring of Scythians and Amazons. Later, in Roman times, called the Sarmatians,they showed up in
the west-as the first heavy armored cavalry (cataph tarii) in Europe. When the Huns came from Cen Asia and in A.D. 375 shatteredthe Ostrogothic Emp that had been established in the former lands of
Scythians, agricultural
Germanic tribes-Goths, Burg
dians, and the much-maligned Vandals-as well as madic tribes from the steppes, such as the Alans, cou of the Scythiansand Sarmatians,were driven from th eastern homes and set adrift westward. The uproo Germanic warriors successfully adopted the noma
cavalry equipment, and from the blending of the t cultures emerged what became a fundamental conc
of the medieval world, chivalry. In 378 the Gothic-Alanic cavalrywiped out a Rom
army at Adrianople, a victory that heralded the do nance of the heavy armored horseman on the medie battlefield. Groups of Alans set themselves up as lo
aristocracies n northernSpain (Catalonia: Goth-Alan
and northern France (Alenqon). Chivalry develop into its final form when another wave of Germa warriors, the Normans, came to northern France a
took up the horsemanship of the Alanic gentry. (T Battle of Hastings, in 1066, was decided by the tim honored nomad tactic of feigned retreat,executed by left wing of the Norman cavalry commanded by

Fish, raisedfrom a sheet of electrum.The dorsal fin is missing, as is the eye, which must have beeninlaid in glass or stone.
The highly stylized fish, of a speciesthat cannot be determined, s decoratedwith animals and a mermanthat are organized along the anatomical divisions. The tail is ornamentedwith an eagle, and its
curving points are in the shape of rams heads and necks. The backshows a panther attackinga boar and a lion seizing a fallow deer; the belly is given over to a school of six fishled by a mermanwho wields a seventhfish in his right hand. The movement of all animals is from left to right, and the direction follows that of the fishwhich they embellish. On the undersideof the fish four
staples are still in place, proving that the objectwas once fastened to another surface-probably a shield or cuirass
made of a differentmaterial. Though the conceitof coveringthe surfaceof one animal with other animals is not known in Greek art, the style of the merman,small fish, eagle, rams heads, and felines and theirprey bears a strongresmblance to East Greek
(Ionian) art and thus, indirectly,to Etruscanart, which borrowedso freely from it. Hence it has even beenclaimed that the Vettersfeldefish is Etruscan,
an assumptionalreadyrejectedby Furtwangler,who saw at once the stylistic affinityof the Vettersfeldefish to the stag from the Kul Oba tumulus at Kerch (illustrated hereas color plate 15, cat. no. 77). There, too, the anatomical divisions of the animal were employed as
backgroundfor other animals superposed as it were, and one of the points of the antlers terminatesin a ram s head and
neck, quite analogous to the tips of the tail on the Vettersfelde fish. Moreover
Greifenhagenhas pointed out that the rope contourof the finsrecurson
the Scythianstag in Budapest from Zoldhalompuszta.These two parallels sufficeto assign the Vettersfeldefind firmlyto the realm of Scythianart.

The material remains of the Scythians, particularly the gold and silver from the Royal tombs, have been found
largely by accident. Nevertheless, the various persons who explored and excavated these incredibly rich burial
mounds during the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries made some record of their discoveries. Frequently there are general lists of the finds
according to provenance; more rarely, drawings or diagrams accompany these notes to illustrate the original placement of the objects in the tomb and their relationship to the human and animal skeletons. There were, however, some regrettable occasions when the works of
art, especially those made of gold, silver, and semiprecious stones, passed into the hands of private collectors and dealers with no factual evidence aside from their appearanceto indicate the region from which they
came or the period of their manufacture. This is the situation with the objects from the so-called Maikop
Treasure, allegedly from the Kuban river region, northwest of the Caucasusmountains. Early in the twentieth centurythis treasure was acquiredfrom three separate sources by three museums, the Berliner Museen; The
University Museum, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia; and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Some of the Maikop pieces in the three museums are identical. There are also unique objects in all three
collections supposedly belonging to the same Maikop
finTd.he largest number of pieces and the finest examples from this treasure are at present in the Antikenabteilung of the Staatliche Museen, PreussischerKultur
besitz, West Berlin, and have been published by Adolf Greifenhagen in the first volume of his catalogue of the gold and silver in Berlin. There he dates the Berlin pieces in the middle of the fifth century B.C. and accepts Rostovtzeff's conclusion that the objects come from the
Kuban region, probably Maikop. This date is in accordance with the evidence provided by a Greek vessel
and vase fragment included among the Philadelphia
Maikop objects that can be firmly dated in the fifth
century (see Figures 11, 12. ) It is therefore possible that many of the pieces in Berlin and Philadelphia, as well as objects in New York, were made during the fifth century, but there is no proof that all are from the same site
or burial. It is certainly unlikely that this is the complete
inventory of a Royal Scythiantomb as there are no largescale works in precious metal such as weapons. By the time hoards or treasures reach museums
from the antiquities market, it often happens that m cellaneous objects varying in date and style have beco attached to the original group. Some such pieces are
the 'Maikop collections purchasedby Philadelphia a Berlin. Those in Philadelphia include works as late
the second half of the first millennium A.D. in da Although these cannot be assigned to a Royal Scyth burial,their original provenancemay have been the Bla Sea region. Therefore their inclusion in a Scythian fin when it appearedon the market would not be surprisi
The material shown here, allegedly from Maikop most accurately described as an assortment of obje from the Black Sea region. Among them are many pie that may have come from one Scythiantomb of the fi
centuryB.C., although it cannot be proven. Others m be from graves of a different date but quite proba
from the same region. As is to be expected in lan
occupied by nomads, local products are supplemen
by those of foreign manufacture, notably imports fr workshops in Greece and the Near East. The var objects included in this treasure llustrate the uncert
archaeological history of the Pontic region as well
the styles developed by many peoples-Scythians, Sar tians, Huns, and Turks-who passed through or sett on the borders of the Black Sea in the period from mid-first millennium B.C. to the end of the first mill nium A.D.
StaatlicheMuseen,estBerlin
A large number of silver, gold, and bronze objects w acquiredin 1913 from an Armenian dealer, who claim that their provenance was the region north of Black Sea between the Dnieper and Dniester rivers.
Rostovtzeff, in 1931, reattributed his group to the reg of the Kuban river valley farther east, where sim works had been found. A portion of this collection w
published by Greifenhagen in 1970 as coming from Kuban region (Maikop) ; included under this head
are a variety of gold and silver pieces, probably all o
mid- or late 5th-century date. Greifenhagen does believe that the bronzes (now in East Berlin) acqui with the gold and silver necessarilycome from the sa burial. He finds no certain proof that they are imm diately connected with the so-called Maikop find.

The Maikop material was purchased for this museum by a private collector at an auction of the Ercole Canessa Collection held in New York in 1930. The lot acquired, number 120, The Maikop Treasure, included gold,
silver, bronze, and pottery objects ranging in date from
the early 5th centuryB.C. to the 8th or 9th centuriesA.D.
These pieces were described in an earlier Canessa cata
logue (1915) as being from various Scythian tombs in
the province of Kuban, not simply from Maikop. They had been seen in Paris by John Marshall in 1913, the
same yearthat Berlin acquiredits Maikop objects.
It is possible to assign a number of the gold pieces as well as some of the bronze and pottery ones to the 5th centuryB.C. This constitutesthe bulk of the Philadelphia
collection and includes all the works of typical Scythi
form and style. Among these objects are exact duplicat
of some of the gold plaques and jewelry in Berlin an New York. Parallels for the bronzes exist among tho
purchasedby Berlin in 1913 with the silver and gold.

The flat gold plaques from Maikop in Philadelphia ncludea numberof different
types.The openworkstags and griffins in the upper two rows have precisely definedbody surfaces.Small loops are attachedto theirbacks.In typicalScythian fashion the stags incorporatesmall birds' heads within the tremendousantlers.Both types of plaques are in Berlin and New York. Of Greekworkmanshiparethe two thin
gold plaquesin thecenterof the upper rows: on these appearheads of horned lion-griffinswithin beadedframes.Other examplesof theseplaques are in Berlin. In the bottom row the crudelyworked plaques reflectbothGreekand Scythian designs.The siren on the left is derived from a Greekmotif, while the griffinon
the right is more typically Scythian.A
completegriffinplaque in Philadelphia has a small bird'shead at the end of the
tail. In the centerof the bottomrow is a tiny hollow stag's head with a small pendant
hanging from the mouth. Greifenhagen has suggestedthat almost identicalpieces
inBerlinandLeningrad(Hermitage) may once have decorateddiadems.

The presenceof these fragmentarygold diadems in the Maikop group in
Philadelphia supportsthe theorythat the 5th-centuryobjectsfrom this treasure may be part of the inventoryof a Royal Scythiantomb. Suchdiadems were worn
only by persons of the highest rank.
Length of lower diadem 25 cm. (913/i6 in.). Acc. nos. 30.33-5, 6.

The large birdof preygraspinga fishin its beak and talons repeatsin bronzea
design more skillfully renderedon gold
plaques among the Maikoppieces in Berlin (see Figure 5). The birdwith its head turnedbackwardand the wolf's
head have characteristicallyScythian curvilinearoutlines and exaggerated circulareyes. Both bronzeshave parallels among the bronzes n Berlinoriginally
purchasedwith the Maikop gold and silver.

This black-figured kyphos (one handle is missing) is of a specialshape in which the base is pinchedin and the lip is
offset.It has beenattributedby Sir John
Beazleyto the LancutGroup that is connectedwith late membersof the Haimon Group, hencedatable about470
B.C. Black-figure s now in its decline, and here the artistno longer enlivenshis silhouetteswith incised lines and added colors. The hairdos indicate thatthe lyre players are women. Otherskyphoiof this group have been found in Olynthos, a city in northern Greece;this one may have beenexported to Maikop from a Greekcity or settlement in northernGreeceor the Black Sea area.
Diameter 17.5 cm. (67%n.); height 9.8 cm. (315i6 n.). Acc. no. 30.33-130.

This fragmentof a red-figuredpelikehas beenattributedby Dietrich von Bothmer to the Painter of LouvreG 539, a minor Attic painterof the late 5th centuryB.C.
The Peloponnesianwar, which ended in the defeat of Athens, ruinedthe traditionalmarketsfor Athenianwaresin the west, and this commercialdecline
was accompaniedby an artisticone. A
generation ater, a new impetuswas given to Attic vase painting by the increased exportto the Greekcoloniesin South Russia and beyond.
Height 7.5 cm. (215/6in.); width 6.5 cm. (29e6 n.). Acc. no. 30.33-131.
This ratherbizarrebronzepin, sheathed in gold foil, is in the shape of a victorious warriorgrasping the head of a slain enemy.Becauseof the extreme simplificationof the forms it is difficult
to date this piece precisely,although it cannotbe earlierthan the beginningof the 1st millennium A.D.
Length8 cm. (31/8n.). Acc. no. 30.33-31. 14
Among the latest Maikopobjects n Philadelphia are a silver bowl and 10
small silver-platedbronzeclasps
(probablyfrom a jacketor a suit of armor). Similarbowls found in the
Kubanregion arein the Hermitage Museum,confirming he fact that the presentvessel may have been found in the
Maikop area.The plant designs, the form of the lion, and the minutepunched
dots on the backgroundsuggest an
8th- or 9th-centuryA.D. date for the bowl
and clasps in The UniversityMuseum. By this time Turkicpeoples had moved into the Ponticregion,and muchof their art shows the influenceof the Islamic Near East and CentralAsia.
Clasps (10): lengths 6.4 cm. (2/3 in.). Bowl: diameter 14.2 cm. (5916 in.). Acc. nos. 30.33-55, 132.

Thirty-two ornaments were acquired in 1924 from John Marshall, who had bought them that year from Merle de Massoneau (Yalta, Crimea), whose collection contained
mostly South Russian antiquities. All the pieces in New York except for two small plaques in the form of a winged lion and bird-headedlion have exact parallels in the Philadelphia and Berlin Maikop collections. Bird
headed lion plaques from Maikop were purchased by the Russian Imperial Archaeological Commission in 1908. They were published in 1909 as being in the collection of the commission in St. Petersburg. A silver
bowl, a pedestal base, and a few other small pieces were found with the plaques.
