Male head probably broken from a seated sculpture. Finely braided or wavy combed hair tied into a double
bun on the back of the head and a plain fillet or headband with two hanging ribbons falling down the back.
The upper lip is shaved and a closely cropped and combed beard lines the pronounced lower jaw. The
stylized almond shaped eyes are framed by long eyebrows. The wide mouth is very similar to that on the
"Priest-King" sculpture. Stylized ears are made of a double curve with a central knob.

Adhvaryu is one of the four Ṛtvijas (Ṛtvik) listed as Hotṛ, Adhvaryu, Udgātṛ and Brahman -- refers to the
priest associated with the Yajurveda, according to the Āpastamba-yajña-paribhāṣā-sūtras.—“The Hotṛ
priest performs with the Ṛg-veda. The Udgātṛ-priest with the Sāma-veda. The Adhvaryu-priest with the
Yajur-veda. The Brahma-priest with all”. Commentary: “With all” means with the three Vedas, because
the Brahma-priest, or superintendent of the whole sacrifice, must be acquainted with the three Vedas.
Others would include the Atharva-veda”-- Gr̥hya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30); Śivapurāṇa 2.2.27: Brahmā
narrated to Nārada:—“[...] once a great yajna was started by Dakṣa, [...] In that yajna that was being
performed in that holy place of Kanakhala, Bhṛgu and other sages were made Ṛtviks by him (Dakṣa). [...]
There were eighty-six thousand Ṛtviks in the performance of the yajna and sixty-four thousand Udgātṛs.
The celestial sages Nārada and others acted as Adhvaryus and Hotṛs. They too were as many. The seven
sages (jointly and) severally repeated the Sāman hymns”. Adhvaryu offers three kinds of oblations, those
that blaze up, those that make great noise and those that sink. The adhvaryu is supposed to contemplate on
and identify with the deity of the eye - Sun or Surya. Note: The reference to the ‘eye’ is the key. Ambaka
‘eye’ rebus: ambaka ‘copper’ as in Tryambaka ‘three coppers’. The dotted circle hieroglyph which
signifies ‘eye’ embellishes the bottom container of the ‘standard device’.

"8.9.3 Stone statue. The Dholavira statue is perhaps the largest that Harappans ever attempted.
It was found placed upside down as a building block of a wall that was raised by the late
Harappans to retain the tilting and bulging northern wall of the passageway of east gate of Castle.
It is made of porous limy sandstone with weak matrix. It was in a seating position with a flat base,
arms resting on the knees, with both the knees drawn up and kept apart as if to show the genitals
as the sculpture has shown no feature of clothing.
"The statue depicts a male individual and its execution is close to realistic. The belly is shown protruding. The rear portion of
the statue also shows evidence of depiction of hair lots falling down, which is also daqmaged. It was certainly vandalised,
possibly just like all the statues, which were found in Mohenjo-daro. The genitals were intentionally rubbed off and damaged. A
mould was prepared of this statue and a cast was prepared which clearly indicated the closure details of even the genitals. It also
indicated the rubbing off of the genitals intentionally while the other details of genitals were clearly visible. It suggests that it
was related to phallus worship, which is nicely corroborated by quite a few finials of pillars with carving in the shape of
phallus.|
"The head portion of this statue is missing now. It seems that its head was intentionally chopped off, elbows and knees are also
considerably damaged. The intentional damage caused to this statue may be a clear indication of the paradigm shift in religious
belief and ideology, most probably belonging to the mature Harappan phase as this statue is found from a secondary context
belonging to Stage VI. The manner in which the statue was damaged clearly indicates that the role played by it could no longer
be appreciated by Stage VI occupants. The depiction of nicely cut inscriptions on the seals of Stage VI, but without any motif
may also indicate a departue of beliefs and customs..."

“A special priest, one conversant with and performing the ritual observances connected
with the Yajurveda; he is one of the sixteen Ṛtvijs required for the performing of the great
Soma sacrifices (see ṛtvij) and, amongst them, one of the four leading priests
(see besides brahman, udgātṛ and hotṛ) who receive the whole dakṣiṇā (q. v.);
his purushas or assistant priests are the pratiprasthātṛ, neṣṭṭa and unnetṛ who are called, like himself,
the dīkṣayitṛ (q. v.) because they initiate, viz. the adhvaryu the three other leading priests,
the pratiprasthātṛ the ardhin- (q. v.), the neṣṭṛ the tṛtīyin- (q. v.) and the unnetṛ the pādin- (q. v.) priests. The
Mimāṃsā decides in doubtful cases, viz. whenever a sacrifice mentioned in and making part of the ritual of
the Yajurveda, is mentioned also and forms part of another Veda, whether the Adhwaryu has another priest to
share in his functions or whether he has to abstain from the proceedings altogether. The
ten camasādhvaryu (q. v.), who, are also assistants or purushas of the Adhwaryu, are distinct from and do not
bear the name of Ṛtvij.—According to a legend in the Harivaṃśa, Nārāyaṇa created the first Adhwaryu from
his arms. The dual adhvaryu is the collective denomination of the adhvaryu and pratiprasthātṛ, his principal
assistant; the plur. adhvaryavaḥ of the adhvaryu and his three assistants, and in general of those devoted to
the study or the practice of the Yajurveda.” https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/adhvaryu

13. When he (the Adhvaryu) has cut off the iḍā piece by piece, and broken off the fore-part of the cake (for the
yajnika's portion), he puts it (the latter) down (on the barhis) before the dhruvā-spoon. Having then handed over the
former (the iḍā) to the Hotṛ, he passes by him towards the south.—Śatapatha brāhmaṇa

each of the havis (or dishes of sacrificial food) from their southern and central parts respectively; and of two
drippings (or bastings, abhighāraṇa) of butter, as in the case of the sviṣṭakṛt (see Kāty. III, 4, 6, and note on I, 7, 3,
20). According to some authorities, the iḍā consists of four cuttings only (cf. Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollm. p. 122).
