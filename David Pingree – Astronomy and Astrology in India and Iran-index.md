ASTRONOMY AND ASTROLOGY
IN INDIA AND IRAN
By David Pingree *
Only in recent years have the interrelationships of Babylonian, Greek,
and Indian astronomy and astrology become a subject which can be
studied meaningfully. This development is due to several factors: our
greatly increased understanding of cuneiform material made
possible by the scholarship of Professor O. Neugebauer;1 the
discovery of Babylonian parameters and techniques not only in the
standard Greek astronomical texts, 2 but in papyri and astrological
treatises as well; and the finding of Mesopotamian material in
Sanskrit works and in the traditions of South India. Unfortunately, a
lack of familiarity with the Sanskrit sources and a failure to consider
the transmission of scientific ideas in the context of a broad historical
perspective have recently led one scholar to the erroneous
conclusion that Sasanian Iran played a crucial rôle in the introduction
of Greek and Babylonian astronomy and astrology to India and in the
development of Indian planetary theory. 3 It is my purpose in this
paper to survey briefly the influence of foreign ideas on Indian
gaṇakas so as to make clear the creative use they made of their
borrowings in devising the yuga-system of astronomy; and then to

examine the character of Sasanian astronomy and astrology, pointing
out their almost complete lack of originality.
The earliest Indian texts which are known — the Vedas, the
Brâhmaṇas, and the Upaniṣads — are seldom concerned with any but
the most obvious of astronomical phenomena; and when they are so
concerned, they speak with an obscurity of language and thought that
renders impossible an adequate exposition of the notions regarding
celestial maĴers to which their authors subscribed. One may point to
the statement that the year consists of 360 days as a possible trace of
Babylonian influence in the Ṛgveda, 4 but there is liĴle else which
lends itself to a similar interpretation. It has often been proposed, of
course, that the list of the twenty-eight nakṣatras which is given for
the first time at the beginning of the last millennium before Christ in
the Atharvaveda and in various Brâhmaṇas is borrowed from
Mesopotamia. 5 But no cuneiform tablet yet deciphered presents a
parallel; the hypothesis cannot be accepted in the total absence of
corroborative evidence.
However, the nakṣatras are useful in the tracing of Indian influence
on other cultures. The oldest lists 6 associate each constellation with a
presiding deity who is to be suitably propitiated at the appointed
times. It became important to perform certain sacrifices only under
the benign influence of particularly auspicious nakṣatras. 7 The roster
of activities for which each was considered auspicious or not was
rapidly expanded, 8 and, in particular, the nakṣatras came to be
closely connected with the twelve or sixteen saṃskâras or purificatory
rites. Thereby they gave rise to the most substantial part of
muhûrtaśâstra, or Indian catarchic astrology,9 traces of which are to
be found in Arabic, Byzantine, and medieval Latin texts. 10 The
Indians also combined the twenty-eight nakṣatras with the Babylonian
arts of brontology and seismology 11 in a form which, for some
unknown reason, became immensely popular among the followers of
Buddha. 12 Their works spread these superstitions throughout Central
Asia and the Far East. 13
The relative seclusion from the West which the Aryans had enjoyed in
northern India for centuries after their invasions was broken shortly
before 513 B.C., when Darius the Great conquered the Indus Valley. In
the ensuing six centuries, save for a century and a half of security
under the Mauryan emperors, North India was subjected to the
successive incursions of the Greeks, the Śakas, the Pahlavas, and the
Kuṣâṅas. An important aspect of this turbulent period was the
opportunity it afforded of contact between the intellectuals of the
West and India. This opportunity was not missed.
In the period from 500 to about 230 B.C. — under the Achemenid
occupation and during the reigns of Candragupta Maurya, Bindusâra,

and Aśoka — Indian astronomy was introduced for the first time to
some reasonable Babylonian methods, and astrologers were led to
show an interest in more significant phenomena than the nakṣatras. 14
A luni-solar calendar was propounded in the Jyotiṣavedân̄ga of
Lagadha, 15 who probably wrote in the fifth century B.C. This calendar
is described also in the Arthaśâstra of Kauṭilya, 16 which seems to be
a Mauryan document; in the Jaina Sûryaprajñapti, 17 which probably
preserves a Mauryan system; in the oldest version of the
Gargasaṃhitâ, 18 which may have been wriĴen in the first
century A.D.; and in the earliest version of the Paitâmasiddhânta, 19
which uses as epoch 80 A.D. The period relation employed in this
calendar — sixty-two synodic months in 1830 days — is extremely
crude and, so far as I know, not Babylonian; but the aĴempt is
analogous to the more accurate eight-year cycle introduced into
Greece by Cleostratus of Tenedos towards the end of the sixth
century B.C.
An important feature of the Jyotiṣavedân̄ga is its use of the tithi, or
thirtieth of a synodic month, as a stand unit of time. Tithis, of course,
play a similar role in the Babylonian linear astronomy of the Seleucid
period. 20 It seems likely that the Indians borrowed the concept from
Mesopotamia, though the exact origin of the tithi still remains
obscure.
In their methods of measuring the time of day, the Indians of this
early period also showed a knowledge of what the Babylonians had
devised. 21 One method depends on the length of the shadow cast by
a śan̄ku or gnomon. This shadow, of course, varies during any
half-day with the changing altitude of the sun; it also varies from day
to day throughout a half-year as the sun travels along the ecliptic. In
tabulating the increase and decrease of the noon-shadow throughout
the year, the Indians employed a linear zigzag system which is
clearly of Babylonian origin. But, more than this, they used 3:2 as the
ratio of the longest to the shortest day of the year, a well-known
Babylonian parameter 22 which is not applicable to any part of India
except the extreme Northwest. 23 The other Indian method of telling
time, by means of a ghaṭa, or pot with a small hole in the boĴom
through which water flows at a fixed rate, is also known to have been
employed in Babylon. 24 In connection with the śan̄ku it may be added
that if one can believe their claims as recorded by Eratosthenes and
Hipparchus via Strabo, 25 both Megasthenes and Daimachus, the
Seleucid ambassadors at the Mauryan capital, Pâtaliputra or
Palibothra, made gnomon-observations in India.
Babylonian influence in astrology was equally great; in fact, the
planets first appear in Indian literature because of it. Venus is
mentioned as the "Star of Plants" (Osadhitârakâ) in an early Buddhist
text, the Majjhimanikâya; 26 and Kauṭilya asserts that the sun, and

Jupiter and Venus in their risings, seĴings, and stations, cooperate in
furthering the growth of plants. 27 The heliacal risings and seĴings of
the planets and their stationary points are the so-called Greek-leĴer
phenomena upon which the structure of Babylonian linear planetary
theory is based.
In the Indian Epics, the Râmâyaṇa and the Mahâbhârata, the planets
also appear in an astrological context, their influence depending on
their conjunctions with the constellations, on their retrogressions, and
on their transits. 28 This type of astrology is termed gocâra; it is
mentioned in a Buddhist anti-caste tract, the Śârdûlakarṇâvadâna, 29
which was probably wriĴen in the first century A.D. and is described in
detail in the Gargasaṃhitâ 30 and in the sixth-century Bṛhatsaṃhitâ of
Varâhamihira. 31 It represents an earlier stage of planetary astrology
than does Hellenistic horoscopy; in fact, it is a method familiar from
the reports of the astrologers of Babylon and Ninevah. 32 From a
Babylonian source also comes the order in which the celestial bodies
are named in the early second-century Nasik cave-inscription set up
by his mother in honor of Gautamîputra Śâtakarṇi33 and in a common
Paurâṇika passage; 34 according to these sources the sun and moon
precede the five star-planets. 35 There is no hint, however, that the
Indians had learned a method of computing planetary positions in
this period.
I have mentioned previously the Śaka or Scythian invasions of North
India; it is necessary now to return to them. A family of Śakas, the
Kṣaharâtas, established a kingdom in western India at the beginning
of the first century A.D. 36 Their capital was Mînanagara, 37 but their
source of wealth, Bhṛgukaccha, the modern Broach, was one of the
main emporia for the brisk trade between India and the
Mediterranean; it was known to the Greeks by the name of
Barygaza. 38 The Periplus maris Erythraei, a document wriĴen
between 60 and 80 A.D., mentions the Kṣaharâta king Nahapâna, 39
whose riches are extolled in Jaina traditions and proved by the vast
hoard of 14,000 silver coins found at Jogalthembi. This wealth
depended largely on the Roman trade. The Śakas exported, besides
many other articles, Chinese silk carried across Central Asia, through
Kuṣâṇa territory down the Indus, across to Ujjain, and down the
Narmadâ valley to Broach. In return they received, along with other
useful products of Roman industry, dancing-girls and jugs of wine. In
innumerable sites in Gujarât, Saurâṣṭra, and northern Mahârâṣṭra
there have been unearthed fragments of Roman poĴery and its
imitations, copies of Roman •bullae, Roman beads, and Roman
statueĴes, all of which date from the first to the fourth
centuries A.D. 40 A large number of inscriptions of the first and second
centuries found in the Buddhist caves along the trade-routes of the
western Ghâṭs record the donations of the Yavanas, or Greeks of
Dhenukâkaṭa. 41 Indeed, one can date the Greek seĴlement in the

area back to Mauryan times if one is willing to accept as sufficient
evidence the Junâgaḍh inscription which mentions the Yavanarâja
Tuṣâspa, who was Aśoka's governor of Kâṭhiâwâḍ. 42 It does not seem
likely, however, despite Tarn's strenuous efforts, 43 that the Greek
kingdom of Demetrius and Menander ever extended this far south,
though Greeks from Gandhâra may well have made commercial trips
to Bhṛgukaccha and Ujjain and augmented the Yavana community in
Gujarât. Ptolemy's source was perhaps taking note of the Greek
seĴlements when he placed towns with such un-Indian names as
Byzantion on the coast below Barygaza. 44
By Ptolemy's time, however, the Kṣaharâta dynasty had been
overthrown by the Sâtavâhana Gautamîputra Śâtakarṇi, 45 whom we
have had occasion to mention before, and he in turn had succumbed
to a new Śaka dynasty, the western Kṣatrapas, in Gujarât and
Saurâṣṭra. The greatest of the Kṣatrapas was Rudradâman I, who
ruled from about 130 to about 160 A.D. His empire at one time
extended over most of Central India, stretching as far as Kauśâmbî in
the North and Kalin̄ga in the East. 46 His capital was Ujjain, which for
this reason became the Greenwich of Indian astronomers and the
Arin of the Arabic and Latin astronomical treatises; for it was he and
his successors who encouraged the introduction of Greek horoscopy
and astronomy into India.
In 150 A.D. Yavaneśvara, the Lord of the Greeks, translated into
Sanskrit prose a Greek astronomical text which had been wriĴen in
Alexandria in the preceding half-century. This translation is now lost,
but there is preserved in an early thirteenth-century palm-leaf
manuscript in Kathmandu 47 a versification of it made in 270 by the
Yavanarâja Sphujidhvaja. In the second century another Greek text
on the same subject was translated into Sanskrit; this text and
Yavaneśvara's were both used by a third-century author named
Satya. Unfortunately, the second translation from the Greek is lost,
and Satya's work is known only from the citations of later astrologers
and in what appears to be a fairly recent forgery. However, there has
survived a work based on both Sphujidhvaja and Satya; this is the
Vṛddhayavanajâtaka of Mînarâja. 48
The name Mînarâja connects its owner with the Mînas whom we have
already come across in Mînanagara, the Kṣaharâta capital. Two other
Mînanagaras are known, and they also are Scythian cities. Mînarâja,
then, must have been a Śaka. But he also calls himself the
Yavanarâja, or King of the Greeks, a title used by Tuṣâspa,
Yavaneśvara, and Sphujidhvaja. One can now also cite an early
fourth-century inscription discovered at Nâgârjunakoṇḍa 49 which
mentions the Śaka of Ujjain, Rudradâman II (c. 335-c. 345), and the
Yavanarâja of Sañjayapuri (Sañjayapuri is probably the same as
Sañjayantî, the modern Sañjân near Bombay, which Ptolemy, who

included it within the kingdom of the western Kṣatrapas, calls
Sazantion). 50 Yavanarâja, then, was an official title in the Śaka
administrations. As the Śakas were overthrown by Candragupta II
shortly after 389, 51 and as the Vṛddhayavanajâtaka copies many
ślokas from Sphujidhvaja, it is safe to date Mînarâja in the early fourth
century; and we have recovered two astrological poems presenting
almost purely Greek horoscopy in Sanskrit.
Indian genethlialogy is largely dependent on the teachings of
Yavaneśvara and Satya, though elaborations have been indulged in
from time to time: and it, in turn, has influenced Sasanian, Arabic,
Byzantine, and western European astrology. But it is more important
for our present purpose to examine the planetary theory given at the
end of Sphujidhvaja's Yavanajâtaka than the spread of the science of
astrology. The system and the parameters in this planetary theory
are precisely identical with those found on cuneiform tablets of the
Seleucid period. It is clear, then, that Babylonian linear astronomy
was transmiĴed to India by the Greeks. 52 Normally, of course, Greek
astronomical texts are devoid of these methods; but
van der Waerden and Neugebauer have shown that the Babylonian
linear system lies behind the so-called Egyptian Eternal Tables 53 and
appears in an astrological text ascribed to the late fifth-century
author Heliodorus 54 (van der Waerden's claim to have found more
than a few Babylonian parameters in the Thesauri of the sixth-century
astrologer Rhetorius of Egypt 55 cannot be accepted). We may
conclude, therefore, that at least some Greek astrologers ignored the
epicyclic and eccentric theories developed by Apollonius, Hipparchus,
and Ptolemy, and adhered to the Babylonian methods; and the Greek
who wrote the original of the Yavanajâtaka in Alexandria between 100
and 150 A.D. was one such astrologer.
Sphujidhvaja mentions the work of the sage Vasiṣṭha; and it is likely
that from the Vasiṣṭhasiddhânta are derived the first fifty-six verses
of the eighteenth book of Varâhamihira's Pañcasiddhântikâ, which
contain another Sanskrit version of Babylonian linear planetary
theory. The second book of the Pañcasiddhântikâ contains a summary
of the solar and lunar theories of the Vasiṣṭhasamâsasiddhânta. 56
The lunar theory is based on two well-known Babylonian period
relations, which also occur in Greek papyri of the second and third
centuries A.D. 57 — the equivalence of nine anomalistic months to
248 days and that of 110 anomalistic months to 3031 days. These same
two period relations are found in the Pauliśasiddhânta 58 and in the
thirteenth-century Candravâkyas of Vararuci, 59 while the second
appears in the Romakasiddhânta 60 and in the UĴarakhaṇḍa of
Brahmagupta's Khaṇḍakhâdyaka. 61 The Vasiṣṭhasamâsasiddhânta
computes the true longitude of the moon according to a Babylonian
linear zigzag system; and a linear system is the basis of Vasiṣṭha's
solar theory, as it also is of Pauliśa's. Therefore, it is apparent that the

earliest form of astronomy introduced into India by the Greeks was
entirely Babylonian in origin.
Greek epicyclic theory soon followed, however, and probably under
the patronage of the same Śaka dynasty of Ujjain. If the last verses of
the last chapter of the Pañcasiddhântikâ are in fact based on the
Pauliśasiddhânta, then Puliśa — who, despite Bîrûnî, 62 has nothing to
do with the fourth-century astrologer Paulus of Alexandria 63 — g i v e s
the same values for the mean synodic arcs of the planets as appear
in cuneiform tablets. 64 But Puliśa computed solar longitude according
to the epicyclic theory, 65 and he included in his siddhânta all of the
trigonometry necessary for the solution of problems in epicyclic
astronomy, including a table of sines derived from the Greek table of
chords. 66
Later in the fourth century, probably not long after the
Pauliśasiddhânta, was wriĴen the Romakasiddhânta, 67 whose name
betrays its origin. That origin is also revealed by the fact that the
Romaka gives a Luni-solar cycle of 2850 years, 68 which is equivalent
to the Metonic cycle of 19 years multiplied by 150 so that its tropical
year may be equal to Hipparchus', or 365 days plus 1⁄4 minus 1/300.
And whereas Puliśa seems to have used an epicyclic model only for
the sun, the Romaka applies this method to both luminaries. 69
Nothing is known of its planetary theory.
Both of these texts were probably based on translations from the
Greek made under the patronage of the Kṣatrapas of Ujjain. That
dynasty, however, became greatly weakened towards the end of the
fourth century, and a new nationalistic state, the Gupta Empire,
gained the hegemony of North India. It is an aĴractive hypothesis to
suppose that the court of Samudragupta or of Candragupta II 70
encouraged an important development in Indian astronomy, the
merging of two concepts of foreign origin into a new theory of
planetary motion. To understand what was achieved we must briefly
consider the kalpa.
A kalpa is a period of 4,320,000,000 years; 72,000 of these kalpas or
311,040,000,000,000 years constitute the life of Brahma. Each kalpa is
divided into 1000 equal parts called mahâyugas, which are 4,320,000
years apiece, and each mahâyuga contains four smaller yugas which
are in the ratios to each other of 4:3, 3:2, and 2:1. The last yuga, then,
the kaliyuga, is 1⁄10 mahâyuga, or 432,000 years. This is a Babylonian
number: sexagesimally it would be wriĴen 2,0,0,0. It is the span of
time given to the Babylonian kingdom before the Flood in the histories
of Berossos 71 and Abydenus. 72 It seems likely that it should have
become known as a significant number in India at the time when
other Babylonian influences were being felt, that is, during the
Achemenid occupation of the Indus Valley. In fact, the kalpa appears

with an eschatological connotation in the fourth and fifth Rock Edicts
of Aśoka 73 and in the Dîghanikâya. 74 However, the first text to
describe the kalpa precisely as I have just done was a
pre-second-century work which was the common source 75 of a
passage occurring in the twelfth book of the Mahâbhârata 76 and in
the first book of the Manusmṛti. 77
This kalpa of ultimately Babylonian origin was combined by Indian
astronomers of the late fourth or early fifth centuries with Greek
epicyclic theory. The mean motions of the planets can be described in
terms of an integer number of revolutions within a given period as
long as that period is fairly long; obviously the kalpa and the
mahâyuga were ideally suited for such a use. But a shorter period,
1/24 mahâyuga, or 180,000 years, was employed also. This was the
yuga which seems to have been the basis of the system of the
original Old Sûryasiddhânta, 78 a work known to us now only through
Varâhamihira's summary of the recension made by Lâṭadeva in
505 A.D. 79 The beginning of the yuga was taken to be a mean
conjunction of all the planets at Aries 0° at midnight between 17 and
18 February -3101.
The period of 180,000 years, however, was not long enough to permit
the use of very accurate parameters. The mahâyuga was somewhat
beĴer, though not as good as might be expected. For the mean
conjunction in -3101 was taken to mark the beginning of the last and
smallest yuga, the kaliyuga of only 432,000 years. Since the mahâyuga
itself had to begin with a similar conjunction, one was forced to fit the
parameters into a period only 1⁄10 as long as the whole yuga in order
that the conjunction of the beginning of the kaliyuga might in fact take
place. Practically speaking, then, one had a period only 22⁄5 as long as
180,000 years rather than one 24 times as long. Âryabhaṭa in 499
solved this problem in part by making the four yugas within the
mahâyuga equal; 80 this gave him an effective period of
1,080,000 years. But this defiance of tradition was not welcomed by
many in India.
However, even before Âryabhaṭa astronomers had realized the
advantages of working with a kalpa, 81 despite the enormous numbers
with which one had to compute. That the parameters could be further
refined was perhaps not as decisive a factor in their choice of the
longer period as the fact that its length allowed one to begin the
system with a true conjunction rather than with the mean conjunction
which the original Old Sûryasiddhânta and Âryabhaṭa had to accept.
For the kalpa gave one enough time to pull the apogees back to the
beginning of the zodiac and to endow them with such a slow motion
that they would have reached their proper positions in the fifth
century A.D.

The Indians of the Gupta Age, therefore, seem to have been the
originators of the yuga-system of astronomy and to have developed
variants employing periods of 180,000, 4,320,000, and 4,320,000,000
years. The elements which they used were admiĴedly of Greek and
Babylonian derivation, but only they had the necessary theoretical
knowledge and the inspiration.
Our subsequent remarks will indicate the absence of any evidence
for much knowledge or inspiration in Sasanian astronomy. But first it
is necessary to mention an intriguing community in India which was,
I believe, the only post-Achemenid group of Iranians who were in a
position historically to influence the development of Indian
astronomy and astrology before the Muslim invasions. The Pahlavas,
who had established kingdoms in northwestern India in the first
century B.C., left descendants who became integrated into Hindu
society as a special class of Brâhmaṇas, the Maga Brâhmaṇas; 82 the
great sixth-century astrologer Varâhamihira was one of their
number. 83 They are known from various reports, all of which portray
them as good Hindus whose only idiosyncrasy was an inordinate
devotion to the sun. But the important fact about these Magi is that
they seem to have had no contact with Iran after the first
century A.D., and no one would suggest that the Pahlavas knew of
yuga astronomy. 84
In fact, virtually nothing is known of the astronomy and astrology of
pre-Sasanian Iran. There was indeed a Greek astrological text of the
second century B.C. ascribed to Zoroaster of which fragments are
preserved by Proclus and the Geoponica; 85 the material with which it
deals is overwhelmingly Babylonian. 86 But there is reason to believe
that it is the product of the Magusaeans of Asia Minor and in no way
reflects scientific knowledge in Iran. However, we have seen before
that certain Babylonian astronomical and astrological theories were
transmiĴed to India during the Achemenid occupation of the Indus
Valley; it is difficult to believe that the Persians were not exposed to
the same influences as their remote vassals in India. In fact, a linear
shadow text which may be an echo of this influence is preserved in
the ninth-century Pahlavi Shâyast Lâ-shâyast. 87
We have previously mentioned the fact that Buddhists introduced
nakṣatra astrology into Iran and Central Asia. The
Śârdulakarṇâvadâna, which contains a thorough exposition of this
system, was extremely popular in this area. It was summarized in
Chinese by the Parthian prince An Shih-kao in the second
century A.D. 88 and fully translated twice in the third. 89 A long
fragment of the Sanskrit text wriĴen in about 500 A.D. was among the
Weber manuscripts found south of Yarkand, 90 and fragments of fifth
century manuscripts of the Mahâmâyûrividyârâjñî, which also deals
with nakṣatra astrology to some extent, are preserved among the

Bower and Petrovski manuscripts from Kashgar. 91 To reach these
places the texts most probably passed through Buddhist communities
in the eastern provinces of the Sasanian Empire; and one finds the
remains of this Buddhist influence in the second chapter of the
Bundahishn, where the twenty-eight nakṣatras are listed with Persian
names. 92 Also connected with this type of astrology perhaps is the
theory that the moon is the bestower of all benefits upon mankind,
which is mentioned in the ninth-century Dâdistân-î Dînîk. 93 Perhaps, if
Tabarî's story is not entirely fictitious, the "goodness of birth" which
the astrologers observed for the first Ardashîr 94 was the presence of
the moon in an auspicious nakṣatra. One might also suggest that
Firdôsi's frequent references to the good or bad achrat or
constellation of an individual95 are to be interpreted in a similar way.
However, trustworthy knowledge of Iranian astronomy and astrology
is non-existent before the reign of Shâpûr I (240-270). He encouraged
the spread of Greek and Indian science within his realm. 96 The
hexameters of the first-century astrologer Dorotheus of Sidon,
preserved only in fragments in Greek, were translated into Pahlavi
under Shâpûr; we now have a late eighth-century Arabic translation
of this Pahlavi version made by ʽUmar ibn Farrukhân. 97 From this it is
clear that the original third-century Pahlavi version was revised at the
end of the fourth or the beginning of the fifth century, and some
Indian theories were added — in particular, that of the navâṃśas are
ninths of a sign. This mixture of Greek and Indian material is
characteristic of the Sasanians; it is found also in the fragments of an
Arabic translation of the Pahlavi version of the Anthologies of the
second-century astrologer VeĴius Valens, fragments recently
identified by Professor Kennedy in a manuscript in the British
Museum. 98 Bîrûnî says that this Pahlavi work is one of the main
sources of Abû Maʽshar's Magnus Introductorius. 99 The same British
Museum manuscript preserves parts of an Arabic version of the
Pahlavi translation of Teucer of Babylon.
We do not know so much of the studies of astronomy under Shâpûr,
though it does seem that Ptolemy's Syntaxis was one of the Greek
works translated in this period. 100 It has sometimes been supposed
that Shâpûr's foundation at Jundi-Shâpûr included an observatory, but
no observations are known to have been made there in pre-Islamic
times. 101
At some point in early Sasanian history, however, an official
astronomical work was compiled, the Zîj-i Shah. 102 This, as we know
from Bîrûnî, was revised under Khusrau I (531-579), 103 another ruler
who encouraged Greek or Greco-Syrian and Indian scholars in Iran.
At present the various versions are known very imperfectly in the
citations of the early Islamic astronomers and astrologers; but from
these fragments Professor Kennedy has been able to demonstrate

that this zîj contains parameters from the ârddharâtrika or Midnight
system of Âryabhaṭa, which is the same as that of the Old
Sûryasiddhânta of Lâṭadeva and the Khaṇḍakhâdyaka of
Brahmagupta. It has also been possible to show that a series of
horoscopes of the vernal equinoxes of the first regnal years of the
Sasanian kings, probably due to the ninth-century astrologer from
Balkh, Abû Maʽshar, was computed by means of the planetary theory
of the Old Sûryasiddhânta. 104 Another possible influence which this
text may have had is on a Zoroastrian doctrine preserved in the
Greater Bundahishn and in the Shikandgûmânîk vijâr. These works
state that the planets are bound by chords to the chariot of the
sun. 105 Bîrûnî, in his book On Transits, also aĴributes this theory to
the Persians. 106 A similar idea appears in a Manichaean text from
Turfan 107 and in the seventh- or eighth-century Mandaean Ginzâ. 108
The modern Sûryasiddhânta, which is known to preserve many of the
theories of its similarly named predecessors, explains the anomalies
in planetary motion by the activities of demons stationed at the sun,
the apogees, and the nodes, who pull the planets along by chords of
wind. 109 The Sasanian concept would appear to be a reflection of the
Indian. Therefore, either the Old Sûryasiddhânta itself or a very
similar text must have been translated into Pahlavi, perhaps under
Khusrau.
Sanskrit astrological works were also popular in Iran. The early
Islamic astrologers — many of whom were Persians — incorporated
numerous Indian theories into their books, and most of these must
have reached them through Pahlavi texts. Of course, there were
direct translations from Sanskrit into Arabic made in the eighth
century, but these seem to have been mainly of astronomical works,
such as the Brâhmasphuṭasiddhânta and the Khaṇḍakhâdyaka of
Brahmagupta; Bîrûnî says that in his time no Sanskrit astrological
treatises had been translated into Arabic. 110 The Indo-Iranian
astrology of these early Islamic authors reached Byzantium at the
end of the eighth century in the works of pseudo-Stephanus of
Alexandria and of Theophilus of Edessa; more was translated into
Greek in the Comnenan period, the late eleventh and twelfth
centuries. 111 It arrived in the Latin West in the twelfth and following
centuries. These translations are useful because of their preservation
of texts which sometimes have been lost in the original Arabic.
The most important of the transmiĴers of Indo-Iranian astrology was
Abû Maʽshar. In his Book of the Thousands, epitomized by al-Sijzî in
the late tenth century, 112 he gave a yuga-system of astronomy which
he called the Thousands of the Persians. The mean motions of the
planets in this system are preserved in Bîrûnî's Book of Instruction in
the Elements of the Art of Astrology. 113 The period used is
360,000 years, in the middle of which — on 17 February -3101
occurred the mean conjunction of the planets at Aries 0°, which, for

the Indians, marks the beginning of kaliyuga; Abû Maʽshar interprets
it as the indicator of the Flood.
To date the Flood in -3101 is rather strange. But one is not at a loss to
explain it. In his Book of Conjunctions Abû Maʽshar says that this date
was proposed by someone whose name, corruptly preserved in
Arabic, may be Abydenus. 114 Abydenus, it may be remembered, was
one of those Greek historians who placed the Babylonian kingdom of
432,000 years' duration before the Flood; and this 432,000 years is the
length of the kaliyuga which begins in -3101. Someone aware of both
Abydenus' Flood story and the astronomical date of the beginning of
kaliyuga has rather sloppily combined the two traditions. As Bîrûnî
remarks, the Persians did not usually believe in the Flood; but there
were some who did accept it, confining its effectiveness to western
Asia. 115 It is surely these Persians whom one must suspect of dating
the Flood in -3101, for they occupied the ground, quite literally,
between the two ideas which were synthesized. This interpretation
agrees with Bîrûnî's statement in the India that Abû Maʽshar's date
for the Flood was derived from Hindu kalpa-theory. 116
In any case, -3101 cannot be a Greek date for the Flood. The only
known astrological Flood-theory in Greece is that derived from
Berossos' Babyloniaka, according to which a conjunction of all the
planets in Cancer produces an ecpyrosis, or conflagration, whereas a
conjunction in Capricorn causes a kataklysmos, or flood. 117 The
choice of Cancer and Capricorn is clearly due to a desire to connect
the world-year with the summer and winter solstices. In this tradition
the Aries conjunction of -3101 is meaningless.
But it is also contrary to astrological theory. The zodiac is divided into
four triplicities, which are connected with the four elements. The first
consists of Aries, Leo, and SagiĴarius, and is fiery; the second of
Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn, and is earthy; the third of Gemini, Libra,
and Aquarius, and is airy; and the last of Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces,
and is watery. The conjunction of -3101 occurs in a fiery triplicity and
astrologically must indicate, if anything, a conflagration, not a flood.
The laĴer can take place only when there is a conjunction in a watery
triplicity. This was recognized by Abû Maʽshar' predecessor,
Mâshâʽallâh, who dated the Flood in -3300 118 because in that year
occurred a Saturn-Jupiter conjunction in Cancer, the first sign of the
watery triplicity; and Mâshâʽallâh expressly states that he is using the
Zîj-i Shâh. Cancer is also connected with the Flood in the Pahlavi
Bundahishn. 119
As has been said before, Abû Maʽshar's yuga is 360,000 years split in
half by the Flood; in other words, the 180,000 years of the original Old
Sûryasiddhânta. In fact, the parameters which Abû Maʽshar gives for
the moon, Mars, Venus, and Mercury — if one corrects the last by

one — are exactly one-twelfth of those in the Old Sûryasiddhânta of
Lâṭadeva. But the parameter for Saturn is one-twelfth of that in the
Somasiddhânta, the Brahmasiddhânta of the Śakalyasaṃhitâ, the
Vṛddhayavanajâtaka, and the modern Sûryasiddhânta; and that for
Jupiter is one-twelfth of what appears in the Âryabhaṭîya. 120
Therefore, the so-called Thousands of the Persians is really an
eclectic Indian system. Abû Maʽshar, of course, probably found it in
some Pahlavi text or Arabic translation thereof; but I think its ultimate
origin is now clear. In the On Transits, Bîrûnî recognizes that the
equations in Abû Maʽshar's zîj were taken from the Zîj-i Shâh, which
had got them from an Indian source. 121
That Abû Maʽshar is extremely unreliable in what he reports,
moreover, can easily be shown from a statement of his which Bîrûnî
has preserved in his Chronology of the Ancient Nations. 122 There he
asserts that, using the system of the Persians, he has found that the
planets are not in mean conjunction at Aries 0° at the time of the
vernal equinox of -3101, but are scaĴered between Pisces 27° and
Aries 1°. Abû Maʽshar is convicted of lying by one glance at the
parameters of his Thousands of the Persians. Those for the superior
planets and the sun are all divisible by two, and as the conjunction
of -3101 took place exactly in the middle of the yuga of 360,000 years,
they must all be at Aries 0° at that date; the mean positions of the
inferior planets, of course, are identical with the mean sun. So
Abû Maʽshar's statement is nonsense when referred to his Persian
system; but its source, fortunately, is known. In the kalpa-system of
the Brâhmasphuṭasiddhânta the mean planets are precisely between
the limits set by Abû Maʽshar at the beginning of kaliyuga. This fact
was not unnoticed by the Indians; it is recorded in the
Siddhântaśekhara of the eleventh-century Śrîpati. 123 It must have
been part of the polemic addressed by the partisans of the mahâyuga
against those who preferred the kalpa. Abû Maʽshar has stupidly
used it as a criticism of a system for which it is totally irrelevant.
So far nothing original has turned up in Sasanian astronomy and
astrology, save for the fact that they synthesized Greek and Indian
theories. However, we do know of one concept which seems definitely
to be an Iranian innovation. This is the theory that history is the
unfolding of the influences of periodically recurring Saturn-Jupiter
conjunctions. 124
Roughly, the idea behind astrological history is this. A Saturn-Jupiter
conjunction takes place about every 20 years; a series will occur in the
signs of one triplicity for about 240 years, that is twelve conjunctions;
and they will have passed through the four triplicities and begin the
cycle again after about 960 years. When they shift from one triplicity
to another, they indicate events on the order of dynastic changes. The
completion of a cycle of 960 years, which is mixed up with various

millennial theories, causes revolutionary events such as the
appearance of a major prophet. The ordinary course of politics is
dependent on the horoscopes of the vernal equinoxes of the years in
which the minor conjunctions within a triplicity take place.
The tenth-century astrologer Ibn Hibintâ preserves fragments of an
astrological history wriĴen on this principle by Mâshâʽallâh, and a
Parisian manuscript of a compilation by al-Sijzî contains the
horoscopes, but not the interpretations, for such a history wriĴen
under Hârûn al-Rashîd. Al-Kindî and Abû Maʽshar also wrote on these
conjunctions, as did pseudo-Stephanus of Alexandria in Greek.
A non-Greek doctrine such as that of the Saturn-Jupiter conjunctions,
occurring in the works of the early Islamic astrologers, may be
assumed to have an Iranian origin. But there is more substantial
evidence of the theory's Sasanian background; Ibn Khaldun says that
Khusrau's famous minister, Buzurjmihr, was familiar with the method,
and he cites from Jirâsh as an authority on the subject an astrologer
with the obviously Iranian name of Hurmuzdâfrîd.
Astrological history by Saturn-Jupiter conjunctions, then, is the main,
if not the only, Sasanian contribution to astronomy or astrology.
Since, through the conjunction of -3101, it is closely linked with the
yuga-system of astronomy, one would expect that any astronomer
who learned the laĴer from the Sasanians would also have learned
the former. But there is not a trace of the knowledge of these
conjunctions in India. This I take to be fairly conclusive evidence that
Indian yuga-astronomy could not have been borrowed from Iran, but
instead profoundly influenced Sasanian science.

39 The date of the Periplus and the reference to Nahapâna have
recently been questioned by J. Pirenne, Le royaume sud-arabe de Qatabân
et sa datation, Bibliothèque du Muséon, 48, Louvain, 1961, chap. 5. Her
arguments are not entirely convincing; but even were they to prove
correct, the conclusions reached in this paper would not be affected.
Whether the Periplus refers to Nahapâna or not, I would not connect
him with the Śaka era of 78 A.D.

55 Vjschr. Naturf. Ges. Zürich, 1955, 100:165; Rhetorius' period (1,753,005
years) and planetary parameters are different from the Indian
parallels adduced by van der Waerden, and there is no evidence to
support the hypothesis that a yuga-system of astronomy was ever
known in Greece, much less in Babylon. Professor Neugebauer, who
has examined a photograph of the manuscript, informs me that one
should read 1,753,200 rather than 1,753,005 (i.e., a ς for an ε).

63 There are at least three Pauliśa- (or Puliśa) siddhântas. The first is
the original work, probably of the fourth century; it is lost. The second
is the edition of Lâṭadeva, wriĴen around 505 A.D.; it also is lost, but a
summary is preserved in the Pañcasiddhântikâ. The third is a later
work modeled on a standard Indian siddhânta; it is lost except for
quotations and references in the commentaries of Pṛthûdaka and
Bhaṭṭotpala and in Bîrûnî's works. As Bîrûnî knows only this third
Puliśa, his statement probably has no relevance for the first and
makes no sense if applied to the text he had before him. Moreover, in
the one detail in which the second Puliśa (Pañcasiddhântikâ 3, 17) and
Paulus Alexandrinus (28) overlap — the values of the mean daily
motion of the sun for the different months in a year — they do not
agree. However, the name Pauliśa might still be a Sanskrit version of
Paulus; the Pauliśasiddhânta did feel it necessary to give corrections
for the differences in longitude between Yavanapura (Alexandria) and
Avanti (Ujjain) and Vârâṇasi (Benares); see Pañcasiddhântikâ 3, 13.
