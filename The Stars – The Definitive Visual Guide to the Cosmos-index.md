FOREWORD
The starry sky on a clear night in a really dark place is uniquely magical. We can only imagine how our ancestors must have marveled at the night sky in the days before artificial lighting made it nearly impossible for many people to see any but the brightest stars. With this book, anyone can find out about the stars. Once you know some of their names and how to recognize constellations, what seem like random star patterns become a picture book in the sky. You will want to look up at night to see what you can recognize—Orion the Hunter, perhaps, the Great Bear, or the Heavenly Twins. However, there is more to the stars than a beautiful sky. There’s a story to tell about how stars are born and change through their lives, ending as exotic white dwarfs, neutron stars, or stellar black holes. Stars light up glowing nebulae, huddle together in clusters, harbor families of planets and populate a universe of galaxies. And you will find all about it here. I became fascinated by the night sky as a young child. As I grew up, my curiosity about science grew too. I wanted to know more and more about the stars and the Universe so I became an astronomer. But the stars are there for all of us to discover. Read on!
◁ Hot blue stars and cooler yellow stars can be seen together in this Hubble Space Telescope image of the globular cluster M15. It is one of the oldest known star clusters, around 12 billion years old. M15 is located 35,000 light-years from Earth, and lies in the constellation Pegasus.

UNDERSTANDING
THE COSMOS






OUT OF THE DARKNESS
◁ Birthplace of stars
The fiery array of stars near the center of this Hubble Space Telescope image is a compact young star cluster some 20,000 light-years away. Called Westerlund 2, it contains some of the hottest, brightest stars known, each with a surface temperature higher than 66,600°F (37,000°C). The cluster lies within a vast, star-forming nebula (cloud of gas and dust) called Gum 29.
of light, seeming to differ only in brightness. However,
stars are actually extremely diverse, coming in
a vast range of sizes and an array of colors. Some
will eventually explode to give rise to such strange
phenomena as pulsars and black holes. We now also
know that many stars, like our Sun, are orbited by
planets, some of which might harbor life. Around the
time that the first stars ignited, the first galaxies
were also forming. Clusters of stars merged into
small galaxies, which in turn merged to make bigger
galaxies. All the stars visible to the unaided eye are
part of our home galaxy, the Milky Way, a structure
so vast that light takes a hundred thousand years
to cross it. But this galaxy is just one of untold
billions of galaxies in the cosmos. Gradually, by using
more and more powerful telescopes and other sensing
instruments, astronomers are unlocking the secrets
of galaxies, along with gaining an understanding
of the nature of mysterious phenomena, such as dark
matter, in which galaxies seem to be embedded.
After bursting into existence 13.8 billion years ago
in the Big Bang, our Universe was for a time entirely
dark because no light-generating objects had yet
formed. After a few hundred million years, clumps
of matter began to coalesce and heat up, and soon
the Universe was bathed in light from the first stars.
Today, stars are still the most numerous visible
objects in the night sky. We see them as pinpricks



12 UNDERSTANDING THE COSMOS
△ Laniakea Supercluster
In this depiction of Laniakea (yellow), white lines indicate the flow of galaxies towards a spot near its center. The approximate position of the Milky Way is shown in red. Laniakea is about 500 million light-years across. It is thought to be surrounded by other similar regions (blue).
THE COSMOS
THE UNIVERSE, OR COSMOS, IS EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS
ALL MATTER, ENERGY, TIME, AND SPACE—AND ITS SCALE IS
QUITE MIND-BOGGLING. JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING IN IT
IS PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER.
The Universe has a hierarchy of structures. Our planet, Earth, is in the Solar System, which lies in the Milky Way Galaxy, itself just one member of a cluster of galaxies called the Local Group. The Local Group in turn is just a part of a larger structure, the Virgo Supercluster. Astronomers have recently identified a vast region of space they have called Laniakea (meaning “immeasurable heaven” in Hawaiian), which contains the Virgo Supercluster and other superclusters. Intriguingly, all the galaxies in it seem to be flowing towards a region at its center, called the Great Attractor.
Light as a yardstick
Astronomers use light as a yardstick for measuring distances because nothing can cross space faster. Yet even one light-year—the distance light travels in a year, or about 6 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km)—is dwarfed by the largest structures in the known Universe. Only a fraction of the whole Universe is visible to us: the part from which light has had time to reach Earth since the Big Bang. The true extent of the Cosmos is still unknown and it may even be infinite.
1 Earth
Our home planet is a small rocky sphere floating in the emptiness of space. Earth’s closest neighboring object is the Moon. On average, it is a little more than one second away at the speed of light, so one could say that the Moon is one light-second distant.
2 Solar System
Earth is part of the Solar System, which comprises our local star, the Sun, and all the objects that orbit the Sun. The most distant planet, Neptune, is about 4.5 hours away at light speed, but the Solar System also includes comets that are up to 1.6 light-years distant.
3 Local stars
A total of 32 stars, some grouped together in star systems, lie within 12.5 light-years of the Solar System. They range from dim red dwarfs, invisible to the naked eye, to dazzling, yellow or white, Sun-like stars. A few are suspected to have their own planets.
4 Milky Way
The Solar System and its stellar neighbours occupy just a tiny region of the Milky Way Galaxy, a vast swirling, glittering disk that contains some 200 billion stars, enormous clouds of gas and dust, and a supermassive black hole at its center. The Milky Way is over 100,000 light-years across. Surrounding it are several smaller, satellite galaxies.

THE COSMOS 13
The observable Universe
Although the Universe has no edges and may be infinite, the part visible to us is finite. Called the observable Universe, it is the region of space from which light has had time to reach us during the 13.8 billion years since the Big Bang. Physically it is a sphere about 93 billion light-years across, with Earth at the center. The inhabitants of a planet located outside our observable Universe (Planet A) would have a different observable Universe to us, though the two observable Universes might overlap.
Light from some of the
most distant known
galaxies has taken over
13 billion years
most of the age of the
Universe—to reach us
5 Local group
The Local Group is a cluster of galaxies consisting of the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy (the nearest large spiral galaxy to the Milky Way), another spiral galaxy called Triangulum, and more than 50 other smaller galaxies. All occupy a region of space about 10 million light-years across.
6 Virgo Supercluster
The Local Group of galaxies, together with several other nearby galaxy clusters, is contained within a vast structure called the Virgo Supercluster. This is 100 million light-years across and contains tens of thousands of galaxies, arranged into clumps or clusters separated by large voids.

▷ Formation of the Universe
The time sequence above depicts some key stages in the evolution of the Universe, from the Big Bang, to the formation of atoms, then stars and galaxies, and events through to the present day and into the future. Since the Big Bang, the Universe has cooled and grown larger through the expansion of space itself.
◁ Studying the Big Bang
Using this complex machine, the Large Hadron Collider, scientists at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) attempt to re-create the conditions that followed the Big Bang. In the collider, beams of high-energy particles are smashed together and the by-products studied.
The first stars form after about 550 million years; around the same time, the first galaxies appear
After less than a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, energy starts turning into matter
THE BIG BANG
ABOUT 13.8 BILLION YEARS AGO, AN EXCEEDINGLY
DRAMATIC EVENT MARKED THE BEGINNING OF BOTH SPACE
AND TIME. FROM NOTHING, THE UNIVERSE SUDDENLY
APPEARED AS A TINY POINT OF PURE ENERGY.
Within an instant, in what is known as the Big Bang, the Universe expanded trillions of trillions of times, and then continued to get larger, at the same time cooling from its stupendously hot birth. During the first fractions of a second, a vast “soup” of tiny, interacting particles formed out of the intense energy. Some of these joined to make the nuclei (centers) of atoms—the building blocks of everything we can see in the Universe today. Tens of thousands of years later, actual atoms formed and then, after hundreds of millions of years, the very first stars and galaxies.
The Universe starts as an unimaginably hot, dense point of energy
Gravity starts pulling the clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms into clumps
Over the next 20 minutes, particles called protons and neutrons form, then atomic nuclei
UNDERSTANDING THE COSMOS
In a tiny, tiny fraction of a second, the Universe expands to the size of a city
Around 380,000 years later, atoms of hydrogen and helium form



△ Evolving galaxies
Looking deep into space also means peering far back in time towards the Big Bang. This Hubble Space Telescope image shows galaxies that are at greatly varying distances and so belong to different times in the evolution of the Universe. The more distant galaxies, from some of the earliest times, appear as fuzzy blobs.
When the Universe is about 8 billion years old, its expansion starts to accelerate
Now 5 billion years old, the Universe consists of vast clusters of galaxies, separated by gigantic voids
Around 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang, the Universe has reached its present size
The Solar System is beginning to form in a Universe that is now about 9 billion years old
As they evolve and merge, galaxies grow larger and develop spiral structures
The Universe is expected to carry on expanding forever



16
Primeval atom
Belgian astronomer and priest Georges Lemaître proposes his “hypothesis of the primeval atom.” This suggests that the Universe has expanded from an initial extremely hot, dense state. His model also provides a solution to Olbers’ paradox.
1931 1920s
THE NATURE OF
THE UNIVERSE
COSMOLOGY—THE STUDY OF THE UNIVERSE AS A
WHOLE—IS A FIELD OF ASTRONOMY THAT SEEKS TO
ANSWER FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE
SIZE, AGE, AND STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE.
Philosophers and astronomers have been grappling with such questions for thousands of years, with mixed success. The answer to one of the biggest—whether the Universe is finite or infinite in extent—is still not known for certain (although an infinite Universe seems more likely). Other fundamental questions about the nature of the Universe for which answers are now known include how and when the Universe began, whether it has any center or edges, and whether it encompasses more than just our galaxy.
UNDERSTANDING THE COSMOS
Georges Lemaître
Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, astronomers at Bell Labs in New Jersey, discover the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR)—a faint glow of radiation coming from everywhere in the sky. It comes to be realized that this is a relic of the Big Bang.
Hoyle coins the term “Big Bang”
British astronomer Fred Hoyle coins the term “Big Bang” for theories that propose the Universe expanded from an exceedingly hot, dense state at a specific moment in the past. The term becomes popular, although Hoyle himself believes in a different theory.
The first elements
Russian–American physicist George Gamow and others work out how—starting with just subatomic particles (in this case protons and neutrons)—the nuclei of different light elements could have formed soon after the start of a very hot, dense, but rapidly expanding Universe.
Expanding Universe
American astronomer Edwin Hubble proves that galaxies exist outside our own and observes that distant galaxies are moving away from us at a rate proportional to their distance. Other astronomers conclude that the whole Universe must be expanding.
Aristotle’s Earth-centerd Universe
The Greek philosopher Aristotle proposes a Universe that is finite in extent, but infinite in time and has a stationary Earth at its center. Aristotle outlined a complex system containing 55 spheres, the last of which marked out the “edge” of the Universe.
Cosmic Egg
Hindu text the Rigveda contains a hymn that describes the Universe as originating from a cosmic golden egg or womb known as Hiranyagarbha. This floated in darkness before breaking apart to give rise to Earth, the heavens (space), and underworlds.

General Theory of Relativity
Einstein publishes his General Theory of Relativity, viewed today as the best account of how gravity works on cosmic scales. It proposes that concentrations of mass warp spacetime. He also devises equations that define various possible universes.

THE NATURE OF THE UNIVERSE 17
The existence of dark energy
High-precision measurements of the CMBR and the recessional velocities of galaxies at different distances provide evidence for dark energy—a mysterious phenomenon that seems to be accelerating the Universe’s expansion.
Variations in the CMBR
Measurements by the COBE (Cosmic Backgroung Explorer) satellite reveal tiny variations in the CMBR, providing a picture of the seeds of large-scale structure when the Universe was a tiny fraction of its present size and just 380,000 years old.
Objects exist outside our galaxy
German philosopher Immanuel Kant suggests that some fuzzy-looking objects in the night sky are galaxies outside the Milky Way Galaxy—implying that the Universe consists of more than just the Milky Way, being considerably bigger.
Sun-centerd Universe
The Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos puts forward his idea that it is the Sun that sits at the center of the Universe, with the Earth orbiting it. Aristarchus also suspects that stars are bodies similar to the Sun, but much farther away.
Spacetime continuum
German physicist Albert Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity proposes that space and time form a combined continuum, spacetime. An inbuilt assumption of his theory is that no location is special—so the Universe has no center and no edge.
Argument against infinite Universe
German astronomer Johannes Kepler argues that any theory of a static, infinite, and eternal Universe is flawed, since in such a Universe, a star would exist in every direction and the night sky would look bright. This argument later comes to be known as Olbers’ paradox.
1980 1992 1999-2001
Inflationary Big Bang theory
The American physicist Alan Guth and colleagues suggest that the Universe expanded at a fantastically fast rate during an extremely early phase of its existence after the Big Bang. The theory helps explain the large-scale structure of the cosmos.
3rd Century BCE
1905 1755 1610
A convincing mathematical model
Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus’s book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium is published. It contains a detailed and convincing mathematical model of the Universe in which the Sun is at the center with Earth and other planets orbiting it.
1543
Gavitational waves detected
Physicists in the US announce that they have detected gravitational waves. The existence of these waves supports the Inflationary Big Bang theory and provides further confirmation of Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity.
2016
1584
An infinite multitude of stars
Italian philosopher and mathematician Giordano Bruno proposes that the Sun is a relatively insignificant star among an infinite multitude of others. He also argues that because the Universe is infinite, it has no center or specific object at its center.

CELESTIAL OBJECTS
SCORES OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBJECTS EXIST OUT IN SPACE, RANGING
FROM COSMIC RAYS—CHARGED SUBATOMIC PARTICLES WHIZZING AROUND
AT EXTREME SPEED—TO VAST, MAJESTIC GALAXY CLUSTERS.
Stars are by far the most numerous objects that can actually be seen, because they emit their own light. Most other observable features of the night sky either consist mainly of stars (galaxies and star clusters) or are visible because they reflect starlight (planets, moons, and comets, for example). In addition, various extremely dim or entirely dark objects, such as brown dwarfs and black holes, are out there, but vary from extremely hard to near-impossible to detect.
△ Comets
Comets are chunks of ice and rock that orbit in the far reaches of the Solar System. A few stray close to the Sun—some at regular intervals. Frozen chemicals in the comet then vaporize to produce a glowing coma (head) and long dust and gas tails.
△ Stars
A star is an extremely hot ball of gas that generates energy through nuclear fusion of hydrogen (and sometimes other elements). All nearby stars are part of the Milky Way Galaxy, which (as shown above) appears as a band across the night sky.
△ Star clusters
A star cluster is a large collection of stars bound together by gravity. Several thousand have been identified in our galaxy, and they fall into two types: globular clusters (like the one shown above) and open clusters.
△ Brown dwarfs
Brown dwarfs are “nearly-stars.” They are more massive than most planets, but not massive enough to sustain the nuclear fusion of ordinary hydrogen, as stars do. This image reveals the dim glow from a brown dwarf (boxed) orbiting a Sun-like star.
△ Star remnants
When giant stars die, they leave various types of remnant. This always includes a compact remnant of the original star’s core. However, this ghostly looking object is gas and dust debris ejected from a star when it exploded as a supernova.
Nebulae
Nebulae are clouds of gas and dust in the vast expanses of space between stars. Many contain regions of star formation. In some, light from hot newborn stars excites gas atoms in the nebula, which then begin to emit light in various colors. An example of one of these colourful objects is the Carina Nebula, shown here. It is a prominent naked-eye sky feature in the Southern Hemisphere.
UNDERSTANDING THE COSMOS



19
△ Planets
A planet is a near-spherical object that orbits a star. It can be rocky or gaseous but does not generate energy by nuclear fusion. This one is Mars in our own Solar System.
△ Moons
A moon is any naturally occurring object orbiting a planet or other body. Hundreds of moons have been identified in the Solar System, including this satellite of Saturn, Mimas.
◁ Galaxies
A collection of stars, gas, dust, nebulae, star remnants, planets, and smaller bodies is called a galaxy. Four main types exist—spiral, barred spiral, elliptical, and irregular—the example shown here being a spiral. Called NGC908, it is known to be spawning new stars at a frantic rate.
△ Galaxy cluster
Galaxies are grouped into clusters, which are themselves gathered into larger aggregations called superclusters. This galaxy cluster, Abell 2744, contains hundreds of galaxies. The whole cluster is known to be immersed in a vast sea of a mysterious, invisible material called dark matter (see pp.74–75).
CELESTIAL OBJECTS



WHAT IS
A STAR?
A STAR IS AN ENORMOUS BALL OF EXTREMELY
HOT GAS THAT PRODUCES ENERGY IN ITS CORE
AND EMITS THIS ENERGY AT ITS SURFACE.
All the individual stars we can see in the night sky are part of our own galaxy, the Milky Way. Although in cosmic terms these are all “local” stars, they are actually fantastically far away—the closest is nearly 25 trillion miles (40 trillion km) distant, and most are much farther off. Overall in our galaxy there are more than 200 billion stars, of which about 10,000 are visible to the naked eye.
Star appearance and variation
We see all stars in the night sky as just tiny pinpricks of light. Some look brighter than others, but with the unaided eye they don’t seem to differ much in color: all look rather white. In fact, stars are much more varied than might at first appear. They come in a vast range of sizes and temperatures, in an array of colors, and also differ greatly in age and life span. Many of these characteristics of stars are related. For example, a star’s surface temperature and color are closely linked—a star with a relatively low surface temperature glows red, whereas hotter stars appear (with increasing temperature) orange, yellow, white, or blue.
SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION OF STARS
△ Star spectral classes
The specrum of light from a star carries a lot of information about the star. By studying its spectrum, scientists can assign any star to a type, called a spectral class, of which the main ones are listed above.
Photosphere, the visible surface of a star
Energygenerating core
Interior consisting of extremely hot gas, through which energy gradually moves outward
Class Apparent colour
Average surface temperature
Example star
O Blue over 54,000°F
(30,000°C)
Zeta Puppis, also called Naos (Puppis)
B Deep bluish
white 36,000°F (20,000°C) Rigel (Orion)
A Pale bluish
white 15,000°F (8,500°C) Sirius A
(Canis Major)
F White 11,700°F (6,500°C) Procyon A
(Canis Minor)
G Yellow-white 9,500°F (5,300°C) The Sun
K Orange 7,150°F (4,000°C) Aldebaran (Taurus)
M Red 5,350°F (3,000°C) Betelgeuse (Orion)
Prominence, a loop of hot gas emerging from the surface
◁ Sun-like stars
Although different-sized stars differ a little in their internal structure, all have the same basic features as the Sun-like star shown here.

▽ The Hertzsprung–Russell diagram Running diagonally across the diagram is the main sequence—an array of stable stars, ranging from cool red dwarf stars to hotter, bigger, bluish stars. Other parts are occupied by stars that were once on the main sequence but later evolved into luminous giants, and by white dwarfs.
Star classification
Stars can be classified in many ways, but the system preferred by astronomers places the majority into seven main classes (O to M) based on their spectra—the light of various wavelengths received from them. A star’s spectrum contains data relating to its color, temperature, composition, and other properties. In an attempt to see if there is any underlying pattern to the whole range of different stars, in around 1911 and 1913, Danish astronomer
Ejnar Hertzsprung and American astronomer Henry Norris Russell independently plotted hundreds of stars on a scatter diagram according to their spectral class on one axis and luminosity (related to brightness) on the other. This revealed something interesting. Most stars fall into, and spend much of their lives in, a part of the diagram called the main sequence. Other parts are filled by giant stars—known to be nearing the end of their life—and by expired giant stars called white dwarfs.

22 UNDERSTANDING THE COSMOS
△ Proxima Centauri
This photograph is of a red dwarf star, Proxima Centauri. At 4.2 light-years away, it is the closest star to Earth other than our Sun. Alhough brilliant in this Hubble Space Telescope image, relatively speaking it is a dim star with an absolute magnitude of +15.6 and a luminosity that is only a tiny fraction of that of the Sun.
△ Apparent magnitiude
The two brightest stars in the photograph at the top—Alpha Centauri (left) and Hadar (right)—appear roughly as bright as each other. In other words, they have a similar apparent magnitude. But intrinsically, Hadar is much brighter because its absolute magnitude is greater. Alpha Centauri looks about as bright as Hadar only because it is about 90 times closer.
STAR BRIGHTNESS AND DISTANCE
STARS DIFFER HUGELY IN THEIR BRIGHTNESS AND IN THEIR
DISTANCE FROM EARTH, ALTHOUGH ALL, APART FROM THE SUN,
ARE EXTREMELY REMOTE. HOW BRIGHT A STAR LOOKS FROM EARTH
DEPENDS OF COURSE PARTLY ON HOW FAR AWAY IT IS.
Because stars are so far away, obtaining data about them is tricky. Most of the data about any star comes from studying the light and other radiation coming from it, while the distance to the least remote stars can be worked out by measuring tiny annual variations in their sky positions.
Brightness
There are two different ways of stating a star’s brightness: apparent magnitude, which indicates how bright a star looks from Earth, and absolute magnitude, which expresses how bright it would look from a set distance—a better indicator of how brilliant it truly is. On both scales, a change of +1 on the scale means a decrease, and a change of -1 means an increase, in brightness. So, on the apparent magnitude scale, stars just visible to the naked eye score +6 or +5, while very bright stars score about +1 to 0, and the four very brightest have negative scores. The absolute magnitude scale runs from around +20 for some exceptionally dim red dwarfs to around -8 for the brightest supergiant stars. A star’s absolute magnitude is related to a measurement called its visual luminosity. This is the amount of light energy that a star emits per unit of time. Luminosity is often stated relative to that of the Sun.
▽ Brightness comparisons
The apparent and absolute magnitudes, and luminosities, of 11 different stars, including the Sun, are compared in the table below. The stars range from the relatively nearby red dwarf, Proxima Centauri, to distant but fantastically luminous supergiants, such as Rigel.

△ Nearby stars
A total of 32 stars lie within 12.5 light-years of the Sun. This chart shows their positions in space relative to the Sun at the center. Many are small, dim, red dwarf stars, but a few are larger, dazzling, yellow, orange, or white stars. Many belong to multiple star systems—two or three stars that orbit each other, bound together by gravity.
◁ Parallax method
If a nearby star is viewed from Earth on two occasions, when Earth is at opposite sides of its orbit around the Sun, the nearby star seems to shift a little against the background of more distant stars. The amount of shift provides the basis for calculating how far away the star is.

Distance
Stars other than the Sun are so far away that a special unit is needed to express the distance to them. This unit is the light-year and is the distance light travels through space in a year, which is about 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). The 100 brightest stars we can see in the night sky vary from 4.4 to around 2,500 light-years away. The distances to stars can be measured in various ways. For relatively nearby stars, a method called parallax is used (see right). For more remote stars, astronomers have to use more complex indirect methods. Because these methods are less precise, the distances to many stars, even to some of the brightest in the sky, are known only approximately.

△ Large stars
Giant, supergiant, and hypergiant stars are all much larger than and brighter than main-sequence stars with the same surface temperature. Blue stars tend to be smaller than their red equivalents but are equally bright due to much higher surface temperatures than the red stars.



STAR SIZES 25
▷ Dwarf stars
Most stars are described as dwarf stars. This group of small, dim stars includes stars that are about the size of the Sun and many smaller red dwarfs and white dwarfs—tiny remnants of giant stars that have lost their outer layers. Brown dwarfs are bodies without enough mass to trigger nuclear fusion in their cores and are, in that sense, failed stars.
STAR SIZES
DESPITE APPEARING AS MERE PINPRICKS IN THE SKY, STARS
DIFFER GREATLY IN SIZE, WITH MANY SO BIG THAT THEY
DWARF OUR RELATIVELY SMALL SUN AND OTHERS SMALLER
THAN SOME PLANETS IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.
The smallest stars are tiny, super-dense neutron stars that form after a giant star has collapsed. These stars are only 15 miles (25km) in diameter. Most stars in our galaxy are dwarf stars, some of them with less than a thousandth of the Sun’s volume. The largest stars, the super- and hypergiants, can be as much as 8 billion times greater in volume than the Sun. Stars are grouped into categories based on characteristics such as color, size, and brightness. A combination of color and brightness indicates a star’s size. For example, a bright blue star is smaller than an equally bright red star, because a blue star is hotter than a red star and needs less surface area for it to be as bright as a cooler red star.

Stars in this category are all main-sequence stars and very similar in size to the Sun.

Aldebaran is an irregular variable, meaning that its size changes from time to time as it tries to balance out forces of gravity and outward pressure.
WHITE DWARF Sirius B
Sirius B is roughly the same size as Earth, but its mass is nearly equal to that of the Sun.
RED DWARF Proxima Centauri
Red dwarfs are the most numerous star type in our galaxy and will eventually also become white dwarfs.
BROWN DWARF EROS-MP J0032-4405 Not actually stars, most brown dwarfs are about the same size as the planet Jupiter in our Solar System.
△ Measuring sizes
By examining the light curve during an eclipse in an eclipsing binary system (see p.43), it is possible to determine how long it takes for one star to pass the other, thereby making it possible to determine the diameters of the stars.
▷ Ordinary star
The Milky Way consists of at least 200 billion stars, of which 90 percent are in the stable stage (main sequence) of their life cycle. The Sun is a main-sequence star categorized as a yellow dwarf. It has a diameter of 864,000 miles (1.39 million km), but when it runs out of hydrogen it will swell into a red giant before losing its outer layers and finally becoming a white dwarf.

26
△ Nuclear fusion in Sun-like stars
In stars about the size of the Sun or smaller, the main fusion process is called the proton-proton chain reaction. Its overall effect is to convert four protons (hydrogen nuclei) into one helium nucleus, with the release of energy and some tiny subatomic particles.
◁ Inside a high-mass star In stars much more massive than the Sun, energy cannot move through the dense region near the core by radiation, so moves by convection. Outside this is a less dense region where radiation is the main transfer process.
INSIDE A STAR
A STAR IS EFFECTIVELY A MACHINE FOR TRANSFERRING
FANTASTIC AMOUNTS OF ENERGY FROM ITS CENTRAL CORE,
WHERE THE ENERGY IS PRODUCED, OUT TOWARD ITS FIERY
SURFACE. THIS JOURNEY CAN TAKE 100,000 YEARS OR MORE.
In a star, there is continuous flow of this energy from core to surface, where it escapes into space. The flow creates an outward-acting pressure, without which the star would collapse. The source of energy in the core of a star is the joining together, or fusion, of atomic nuclei (the central parts of atoms) to make larger nuclei.
Energy production and transfer
Nuclear fusion involves a tiny loss of mass, which is converted into energy. In most stars the dominant process is one in which hydrogen nuclei combine to form helium nuclei. From the core of a star, energy moves outward by radiation and convection. Radiation is the transfer of energy in the form of light, radiant heat, X-rays, and so on, all of which can be thought of as consisting of tiny packets of energy, called photons. Within a typical star, the gaseous material is so tightly packed that photons cannot travel far before they are absorbed and then reemitted in a different direction. So, energy transferred in this way travels outward in a slow, zigzag fashion. Convection carries energy toward the surface through circular motions of hot gas outward and denser cooler gas inward. Many stars contain layers, with different densities, some transferring energy by radiation, others by convection.

In a Sun-sized star, the core is surrounded by a radiative zone in which energy gradually zigzags outward through the emission and reabsorption of photons (packets of radiant energy). On reaching the convective zone, the energy flows to the surface by circular movements of hot gas outward, and cooler gas inward. At the star’s surface, it escapes as light, heat, and other radiation.

27
Forces inside stars
Whatever the mass of a star, two opposing forces keep it in existence. These are gravity, acting inward, and a pressure force, acting outward. Normally the opposing forces inside a star are in equilibrium, so it maintains its size over long periods of time. But if something causes the forces to become imbalanced, the star will change size. For example, the cores of most stars heat up toward the ends of their lives: the extra heat boosts the outward pressure, so the star swells into a giant or supergiant star.
△ A star in equilibrium
During most of the life of most stars, the inward-pulling force of gravity is exactly balanced by the outward-acting pressure, and the star maintains its size. If the forces get out of balance, the star is destined to either shrink or swell.
△ Inside a red dwarf
Inside a low-mass star (a red dwarf), the star’s interior is mostly too dense for photons to penetrate far without being reabsorbed. Consequently energy is instead carried all the way to the surface by convection cells.

28 UNDERSTANDING THE COSMOS
Lives of medium- and high-mass stars
Medium-mass stars (about the size of the Sun) have shorter lives than red dwarfs, lasting for billions to tens of billions of years. They swell into red giants at the end of their lives. A red giant eventually sheds its outer layers to form an object called a planetary nebula, together with a hot, compact star remnant, known as a white dwarf. The very largest stars have the shortest lives, measured in millions to hundreds of millions of years, because they use up their hydrogen fuel very quickly. In time, they form red supergiants, which disintegrate in stupendous explosions called supernovas. Depending on its mass, the core left by a supernova shrinks to one of two bizarre objects: a neutron star (see pp.36–37) or a stellar black hole (see pp.38–39).

TO A STAR NEXT DEPENDS ON ITS INITIAL MASS.
Stars that form from the smallest clumps of gas and dust become relatively small, cool objects known as red dwarfs. These are the most common stars in our galaxy and last for tens of billions to trillions of years. As red dwarfs age, it is theorized that their surface temperature and brightness increase until eventually they become objects called blue dwarfs, then white dwarfs. Finally they fade to cold, dead, black dwarfs. However, the Universe is not yet old enough for even a blue dwarf to have formed.

When all the fuel is used, the outer layers of the red giant are shed, forming a planetary nebula
Large main-sequence stars produce energy by fusion of hydrogen, then helium, then heavier elements
As heavier elements are fused together in the core, the star expands to form a red supergiant
Eventually, the core turns into iron, the star collapses, and it explodes in a supernova

Stellar recycling
Materials shed from dying stars join the interstellar medium (the name for gas and dust that exists in the space between stars). From there, these materials are recycled into making new stars. Soon after the Big Bang, the Universe contained only the lightest chemical elements: mostly hydrogen and helium. Nearly all other, heavier, elements—such as carbon and oxygen—have been made since then, in stars or in supernova explosions. Through the formation, evolution, and deaths of stars, these heavier elements have gradually become more abundant in the cosmos. Astronomers call the degree to which a star is rich in heavy elements its “metallicity.” Young stars tend to have the highest metallicities, as they contain materials that have already been recycled through several star generations.

◁ The lives of stars
Contrasted here are the life stories of three main categories of stars: (from top) high-mass stars, medium-mass (Sun-sized) stars, and low-mass stars. Stars in each category start off as protostars that have formed in starforming nebulae, but the course of their lives thereafter can be very different.
▷ Longer-term cycle
Stars form partly from materials shed by previous generations of stars. Furthermore, the deaths of massive stars in supernova explosions can trigger changes within the interstellar medium—particularly within star-forming nebulae—that lead to the formation of new stars.

STARBIRTH
STARS FORM OUT OF VAST CLOUDS OF COOL GAS AND
DUST, CALLED MOLECULAR CLOUDS, THAT OCCUPY
PARTS OF INTERSTELLAR SPACE. THE PROCESS OF
STAR FORMATION WITHIN THESE CLOUDS CAN TAKE
MILLIONS OF YEARS.
The molecular clouds where stars are born can be hundreds of light-years across. Most sites of star formation are hidden inside these dense dusty clouds. However, there are places where the radiation from brilliant newly formed stars is clearing the dust away and is lighting up the surrounding gas. We see these star-forming regions as bright nebulae. They include the Eagle Nebula (see opposite) in Serpens, the Orion Nebula (see pp.164–65), and many others. Some specific dark concentrations of dust and gas sometimes seen within molecular clouds are known as Bok globules. These frequently result in the formation of double or multiple star systems (see pp.40–41).
Star formation
For star formation to start within a molecular cloud, a triggering event is needed. This could be a nearby supernova explosion, the passage of the cloud through a more crowded region of space, or an encounter with a passing star. The tidal forces and pressure waves that come into action during these situations push and pull at the cloud, compressing parts until some regions become dense enough for stars to form. Gravity then does the rest of the work of forming each star, pulling more and more material onto the developing knot of matter and concentrating most of it at the center. As the material grows denser, random motions are transformed into a uniform spin around a single axis. Collisions between particles jostling within the cloud raise its temperature, notably in the center, and the newly forming star begins to glow with infrared (heat) radiation. At this stage, the protostar (newly forming star) is quite unstable. It loses mass by expelling gas and dust, directed in two opposing jets from its poles. At its center, it eventually becomes so hot that nuclear fusion starts, and as the balance between gravity and outward-acting pressure begins to equalize, the protostar settles down to become a main-sequence star.
UNDERSTANDING THE COSMOS
1 Dense region forms in a molecular cloud
Some nearby event, such as a supernova, causes dense clumps to come together inside a molecular cloud under the action of gravity. These clumps will become clusters of stars. They break up further into smaller regions called cores.
2 Core starts to collapse
Each core then starts to contract under the influence of gravity, and begins to slowly spin. Over tens of thousands of years, this spinning, gradually concentrating mass of gas and dust collapses down to less than a light-year across.
3 Protostar forms
The contracting cloud forms into a flattened, spinning disk, a few light days across, with a hot central bulge, which eventually stabilizes as a rapidly spinning protostar. Material from the cloud falls inward and feeds onto the star.
4 Protostar ejects material from its poles
Eventually the protostar spins so rapidly that new material falling onto it is flung back off. This excess material forms two tight jets emerging along the rotation axis. The cloud around the protostar flattens to form a protoplanetary disk.
5 Star ignites
When its central core becomes hot enough, nuclear fusion reactions start within the protostar and it begins to shine as a fully fledged star. Over millions of years, planets may gradually grow from material in the disk of dust and gas.
6 Planetary system forms
Radiation pressure from the newborn star blows away the remaining gas (some may accrete onto gas giant planets). Eventually, all that remains is the star, any planets, and possibly some smaller bodies, such as comets and asteroids.

Already visible are several bright young stars whose light and winds are pushing back the remaining filaments of gas and dust.

GRACEFUL CLOUDS OR SHELLS OF GAS PRODUCED DURING
THE DYING DAYS OF SUN-SIZED STARS.
Among the finest-looking celestial objects, planetary nebulae have nothing to do with planets—each is just part of the remains of a disintegrated star. The name planetary nebula comes from the nearly spherical, planet-shaped appearance of some of the first of these objects to be spotted. However, modern telescopes have revealed that they actually come in a wide range of shapes. Some planetary nebulae seem to be genuine rings or spherical shells of gas, but others are butterfly-shaped, hourglass-shaped, or can have any of an apparently infinite variety of other complex structures. What all planetary nebulae have in common is that they result from a red giant star becoming unstable at the end of its life and shedding its outer layers. The instability starts when the star begins to run out of materials to fuse in its core (fusion is the joining together of atomic nuclei to make larger nuclei, with the release of energy).
1 Aging red giant
When a star of about the same mass as the Sun nears the end of its life, its energy production rises and it expands into a red giant as its outer layers puff out. An aging red giant has a carbon-rich core surrounded by hot, dense shells of gas where helium and hydrogen fusion occur, producing huge amounts of energy.
2 Star becomes unstable
Two forces maintain the size of the star: inward-acting gravity and outward-acting pressure generated by energy output. The energy-producing fusion reactions are sensitive to changes in temperature and pressure, so tiny variations in these can cause instability in the star’s size, leading to large-scale pulsations.
3 Star loses material from outer layers
At the extremes of each pulsation, the red giant expands at such a speed that gas in its outer layers can escape the star’s gravity altogether, billowing out into space. The gas is also pushed away by the pressure exerted by particles and photons (tiny packets of light) blasted out from the star’s hot core.

White dwarfs
When a red giant has shed all its outer layers of gas, forming a planetary nebula, what remains is a hot core consisting, in most cases, of carbon and oxygen. This object is called a white dwarf and is extremely dense—a teaspoonful of it would weigh several tons. A white dwarf also starts off extremely hot with a surface temperature of up to 270,000°F (150,000°C). However, it is not hot enough for internal nuclear fusion reactions to occur. Over extremely long periods of time, a white dwarf gradually cools and fades, eventually (it is envisaged) becoming a cold object called a black dwarf. However, the Universe is not yet old enough for any white dwarf to have cooled to the black dwarf stage.
4 Planetary nebula forms
As the star sheds more and more of its gas layers, its core—at this stage usually consisting largely of carbon and oxygen produced by helium fusion—becomes exposed. Intense ultraviolet radiation given off by the core heats the ejected clouds of gas, which begin to glow or fluoresce in a variety of colours due to variations in temperature.
5 Planetary nebula expands
While the nebula expands into space, the excitation from its central star begins to dwindle, and the glow from its gases starts to fade. A planetary nebula typically lasts for a few tens of thousands of years (compared to billions of years for a typical Sun-like star), and during this time it continually evolves.
6 White dwarf remains
Finally, almost all that remains is the exhausted core of the star, known as a white dwarf. Although extremely hot, it looks faint from a distance because of its small size. As the nebula’s material drifts away, it becomes part of the interstellar medium—the diffuse matter that fills the space between stars in a galaxy.
Intensely hot white dwarf
△ Complex-structured planetary nebula
This nebula (NGC 5189) has a complex structure, with two separate bodies of gas expanding outward in different directions. This might be explained by the presence of a second star orbiting the central white dwarf. The nebula lies about 3,000 light-years away.
◁ Fleming 1
This planetary nebula is highly unusual in that it contains two white dwarf stars circling close to each other at the nebula's center. Their orbital motions explain the presence of some remarkably symmetrical jets and other structures that weave into knotty, curved patterns in the surrounding gas.

SUPERNOVAE
A SUPERNOVA IS THE CATACLYSMIC EXPLOSION OF, IN
MOST CASES, A HIGH MASS STAR AT THE END OF ITS LIFE.
A SUPERNOVA BLASTS OUT SO MUCH LIGHT AND OTHER
ENERGY THAT IT CAN BRIEFLY OUTSHINE A GALAXY.
Supernovae are quite rare astronomical events in individual galaxies. None has been clearly observed in our galaxy since 1604, when a supernova some 20,000 light-years away was visible to the naked eye. However, a growing number of supernovae have been spotted in other galaxies, including one in the Large Magellanic Cloud (a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way) in 1987. A new, bright, supernova might occur in our galaxy at any time.
Types and causes
Supernovae are classified according to their spectra into various types, such as 1a, 1b, and II. Types II and Ib are the main varieties in which very high mass stars explode. As they reach the end of their life, these stars swell into supergiants and obtain their energy from nuclear fusion reactions going on in their cores and in a series of shells or layers surrounding their cores. Eventually they start making iron in their cores, but fuel for this process soon runs out. As iron itself cannot be fused to supply energy, energy output in the core suddenly ceases, and this triggers a massive explosion.
Some chemical elements
can be forged only in the
extreme high-energy
conditions of a supernova
Type 1a supernovae
Although most supernovae are caused by the rapid collapse and violent explosions of very high mass stars, one type—known as a Type 1a supernova—has a different mechanism. Supernovae in this category occur in binary star systems (pairs of stars orbiting each other) where at least one star is a white dwarf (see p.20). The transfer of material from a companion star onto a white dwarf, or the collision of two white dwarfs, can both cause Type 1a supernova explosions. These explosions tend to have a uniform light output, which makes observations of them in distant galaxies useful for measuring the distances to those galaxies.

Red giant star

1 Matter transfer between orbiting stars
An aging star, which has swelled into a red giant, begins to spill some gas from its outer layers onto a white dwarf star it is orbiting. This can lead to bright outbursts, called novae, on the surface of the white dwarf.
Matter spilling from red giant
2 White dwarf explodes
The white dwarf’s mass gradually increases from the extra gas it is acquiring. Eventually it becomes unstable and explodes as a Type Ia supernova. The explosion may cause the red giant star to be blasted away.

A supergiant at the end of its life (left) is supported by energy output from its core, where fusion is producing iron, and from the surrounding shells or layers. Pressure produced by this energy output balances the inward force of gravity (above).

Supernova explosion
When a supergiant star explodes, temperatures can reach billions of degrees. In the extreme conditions, atoms of various heavy chemical elements are forged from collisions between subatomic particles. Some elements, such as lead and gold, are naturally made only in supernovae, which are the original source of all atoms of these elements in the Universe.

2 Fusion in core stops
Once the iron-producing fusion process slows down, energy output and pressure in the core suddenly drop, since iron itself cannot be fused to produce energy. The whole star becomes vulnerable to collapse.
3 Core collapses, neutrinos released
As the core implodes at almost one-quarter of the speed of light, its iron nuclei decompose into neutrons. This event is accompanied by a brief but extremely intense burst of tiny subatomic particles called neutrinos.
4 Star explodes
The collapsing star rebounds from the compressed core with a cataclysmic shock wave that compresses and heats the outer layers. Material is thrown out, while the core becomes either a black hole or neutron star.

NEUTRON STARS
A NEUTRON STAR IS AN EXCEEDINGLY DENSE, HOT STAR
REMNANT, FORMED FROM THE COLLAPSE OF THE CORE OF A
MUCH LARGER STAR—FOUR TO EIGHT TIMES MORE MASSIVE
THAN THE SUN—IN A SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION.
Neutron stars are tiny—only about 7–15 miles (10–25 km) across, or about the size of a large city. They are so dense that if a piece the size of a grain of sand was brought to Earth, it would weigh the same as a large passenger airplane. Because they are so compact, neutron stars produce extremely strong gravity: an object on a neutron star’s surface would weigh 100 billion times more than on Earth. Whereas normal matter is made of atoms—which contain a lot of empty spaceneutron stars consist of much more compact matter, mainly the subatomic particles called neutrons.
UNDERSTANDING THE COSMOS
△ Features of a neutron star
A neutron star is an extremely dense, spherical, spinning object, with a surface temperature of about 1,080,000°F (600,000°C). The surface is extremely smooth, its highest “mountains” being no more than 1⁄5 in (5mm) tall. Neutron stars produce beams of electromagnetic radiation, which can be light, radio waves, X-rays, or gamma rays.
Axis of rotation Neutron stars spin rapidly, some as fast as 700 times per second
Magnetic field A neutron star has an extremely powerful magnetic field, which rotates at the same speed as the star
Surface
A neutron star’s gravity is so strong that its solid surface, which is a million times stronger than steel, is pulled into an almost perfectly smooth sphere
Radiation beam
Neutron stars produce beams of electromagnetic radiation from their magnetic poles

△ Pulsar 3C58
This image, taken with a camera that detects X-rays, shows the remains of an ancient supernova explosion. The bright central region, partially obscured by gas that emits X-rays (shown in blue), contains a pulsar. This is producing X-ray beams, which extend for trillions of miles to either side and have created loops and swirls (shown in blue and red) in other remnant material from the supernova.
△ Heart of the Crab Nebula
In the center of the Crab Nebula is a neutron star that is spinning 30 times a second and blasting out a blizzard of particles from its surface, as well as radiation beams from its poles. In this image taken by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the ringlike structures around the pulsar (central blue-white dot) are shock waves produced where the wind of high-speed particles is plowing into the surrounding nebula.
△ Pulsar off
As a pulsar rotates, its radiation beams continually sweep through space. At the instant shown here, neither beam points at Earth, so from the perspective of an observer on Earth, the pulsar is “off.”
△ Pulsar on
A moment later, one of the pulsar’s radiation beams is pointing at Earth. With the right equipment, this will be detectable on Earth as a brief signal or pulse of light, radio waves, X-rays, or other radiation.
△ Pulsar off
Very shortly afterward, the radiation beam is no longer aligned with Earth, so the pulse or signal switches “off ” again. The off/on/off pulses occur at very regular intervals, characteristic of that pulsar.
Pulsars
As they spin and sweep their radiation beams through space, neutron stars are like celestial lighthouses. If at least one of the radiation beams points toward Earth at some point in each rotation, then from Earth it will be detectable as a series of radiation pulses. Neutron stars that are detectable in this way are called “pulsars,” and the timing of their off/on signals have a precision comparable to that of an atomic clock. The first pulsar was discovered in 1967, but today more than 2,000 are known about in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies.

△ Nonrotating and rotating black holes
Black holes fall into rotating and nonrotating types—astronomers think that most rotate. In a nonrotating black hole, the singularity is a point of infinite density at the center of the hole, whereas in the rotating variety, the singularity is ring-shaped. In both types, the event horizon—the boundary of the region of no escape—forms the surface of a sphere. However, around a rotating black hole’s event horizon is an additional region, the ergosphere. Anything entering this is dragged around by the black hole’s spin.
▷ Gravitational light bending
A black hole’s gravity is so strong that it warps nearby spacetime (see p.73) and bends the paths of passing light rays. Shown here are the paths of four, originally parallel, light rays traveling near a black hole. The first two have their paths radically altered and the third ray ends up circling the black hole, just outside its event horizon. The fourth ray goes through the event horizon and spirals into the hole.
BLACK HOLES
A BLACK HOLE IS ONE OF THE STRANGEST OBJECTS IN
THE UNIVERSE—A REGION OF SPACE WHERE MATTER
HAS BEEN SQUEEZED INTO A MINUSCULE POINT OR
RING OF INFINITE DENSITY, CALLED A SINGULARITY.
In a spherical region around the singularity, the gravitational pull toward the center is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. The boundary of the region of no escape is called the event horizon, and anything passing inward through this boundary can never return. There are two main types of black hole. Stellar black holes form from the collapse of the cores of supergiant stars that have exploded as supernovas at the ends of their lives. Supermassive black holes are much bigger and are thought to exist at the centers of most galaxies.
Detecting black holes
Because it emits no light, a black hole cannot be observed or imaged directly. However, some black holes can be detected from their strong gravity, which attracts other matter. These black holes may have disk-shaped collections of gas and dust around them that are spiraling into the black hole, at the same time throwing off vast amounts of X-rays or other radiation. The easiest ones to detect are those that produce jets of high-energy particles from their poles.

Supermassive black hole
At the center galaxy NGC 4258 is a vast black hole into which matter is spiraling, at the same time producing powerful jets of high-energy particles. These jets strike the disk of the galaxy and heat the gas there to thousands of degrees. That is why the center of the galaxy looks bright, not black. The image combines various types of radiation, including visible light (yellow), infrared (red), and X-rays (blue).



MULTIPLE STARS
OUR SUN IS A LONE STAR WITH NO COMPANIONS. HOWEVER, MOST
OF THE STARS WE CAN SEE IN THE SKY BELONG TO MULTIPLE-STAR
SYSTEMS—THAT IS, TWO OR MORE STARS ORBITING EACH OTHER,
BOUND BY GRAVITY.
The stars in a multiple-star system can orbit one another in various different ways. A pair of stars circling around a common center of gravity is called a binary system. If the two stars have the same mass, the center of gravity is halfway between them. More commonly, one star is heavier than the other, and the two stars have orbits of different sizes. In systems of three or more stars, various more complicated orbits are possible. For example, two stars may orbit each other closely, with the third circling the closely orbiting pair at a great distance. Overall, more than half the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy are part of multiple-star systems. These systems are different from star clusters (see pp.44–45), which are large collections of stars only loosely bound by gravity.
True and optical binaries
A star that looks like a single point of light may actually consist of two stars located very close together in the sky. Where these stars are also close together in space and gravitationally bound—they orbit each other—they are known as “true” binaries. An example is Albireo in the constellation Cygnus (see pp.124–25). In contrast, some star pairs that happen to be close in the sky are not close in space, and are not gravitationally bound—they just happen to be in the same direction as seen from Earth. Doubles of this sort are called optical doubles. An example is a star pair called Algedi, or Alpha Capricorni, in the constellation Capricornus (see pp.186-187). Its two components are more than 600 light-years apart.
Red giant
Center of gravity closer to more massive star
△ Equal mass
In binaries that consist of two stars of equal mass, the stars will orbit a common center of gravity, which lies midway between the two stars.
△ Unequal mass
If one of the stars in a binary system is more massive than the other, the system's center of gravity lies closer to the higher-mass star.
△ Significant difference in mass
Sometimes one star is much heavier than the other. In such cases, the center of gravity may lie at the surface of the more massive star, or even inside it.
△ Double binary
In a double binary or quadruple system, each star typically orbits one companion, and the two pairs orbit a single center of gravity.
Center of gravity equal distance from stars
Center of gravity lies inside high-mass star
Single center of gravity



41
Interacting binaries
Sometimes, two stars are so close that material flows from one to the other. These systems are called interacting binaries. The transferred matter forms a disk, called an accretion disk, as it spirals in toward the receiving object. It may also release X-rays. If one of the stars in the binary is a white dwarf, explosions called novae may occur from time to time on the surface of the white dwarf.
△ Transferring material
In this interacting binary, a red giant orbits a white dwarf. Material from the giant is spilling onto the dwarf, forming an accretion disk with occasional nova outbursts.
△ Mira system
The star system Mira in the constellation Cetus consists of a red giant (which happens to vary in brightness) and a white dwarf, clearly separate in this X-ray image, with some material connecting the two stars.

◁ True binary
This telescope image clearly shows two bright stars—one gold, the other blue. The two stars are so close in the sky, however, that to the naked eye they look like a single star, which is known as Albireo (Beta Cygni). Astronomers think that Albireo’s two components orbit each other, so they constitute a true binary, although each orbit takes about 100,000 years.
▷ HD 98800 system
This artist's impression of the HD 98800 system shows two pairs of binary stars. All four stars are bound by gravity, but the distance between the two pairs is about 4.5 billion miles (7.5 billion km). A disk of gas and dust, with two distinct belts, surrounds one of the star pairs, and it is suspected that there is a planet orbiting in the gap between the belts.
▷ Di Cha system
This complex star system, some 520 light-years away, contains four stars arranged in two pairs. Only the the two brightest are clearly visible in this Hubble Space Telescope image. However, all four stars are young and surrounded by a wispy wrapping of dust.

MANY STARS DO NOT SHINE WITH A STEADY LIGHT. SOME
OCCASIONALLY DIP OR FLARE IN BRIGHTNESS, WHILE
OTHERS SLOWLY PULSATE. THESE ARE EXAMPLES OF WHAT
ARE CALLED VARIABLE STARS.
Stars varying in brightness, as seen from Earth, fall into two main categories, called intrinsically variable and extrinsically variable. In intrinsically variable stars, the amount of light emitted by a star varies in a regular cycle, or pulsates, or it occasionally flares up. In extrinsic variables, something affects how much of the star’s light reaches Earth.
Pulsating variables
These intrinsically variable stars continuously change in diameter, in a regular cycle, because of fluctuations in the forces that affect their size (see pp.26–27). In a class of stars called Cepheid variables, a close relationship exists between the average light output of the star and the length of its pulsation cycle. This relationship allows astronomers to determine distances within our galaxy and to other galaxies.
△ Cepheid variable
This star, called RS Puppis, a Cepheid variable, varies in brightness by a factor of five in cycles lasting 41.4 days. As this Hubble Space Telescope image shows, the star is shrouded by thick clouds of dust.
VARIABLE STARS
△ Light curve of a pulsating variable
The amount of light emitted by a pulsating variable fluctuates in a cycle that, depending on the star, can last for anything from several hours to hundreds of days. The fluctuations are closely related to changes in the star’s size.

△ Luminous red nova
This outburst, from the star V838 Monocerotis, was at first thought to be a regular nova, but it is now suspected be due to two stars colliding.
△ GK Persei nova
GK Persei has produced a nova about every three years since 1980. Surrounding it is an expanding cloud of gas and dust called the Firework Nebula.
Flaring or cataclysmic variables
Another type of intrinsically variable star, a nova, or cataclysmic variable, is the sudden brightening of a white dwarf star in a binary system (two stars orbiting each other, see p.41). It is caused by a nuclear explosion on the white dwarf’s surface. This occurs because the white dwarf’s companion star—usually a giant star—has grown so large that its outer layers of hydrogen gas are no longer gravitationally bound to the star and instead fall onto the white dwarf. Subsequently, fusion reactions start up within the accumulated hydrogen on the surface of the white dwarf, triggering a runaway nuclear explosion. Prior to the outburst, the binary system may have been invisible to the naked eye, so the outburst brings the system into visibility as a “nova” (which is Latin for “new”) star. Some binary systems produce recurrent novae, separated by quiet periods ranging in length from a few years to thousands of years.
UNDERSTANDING THE COSMOS
Period of one pulsation



43
Binary star systems
Extrinsic variable stars owe their apparent variations in brightness to something other than changes in light output. The most important group of extrinsic variables are eclipsing binaries. These are binary systems (two stars orbiting each other) with an orbital plane that lines up with Earth. From time to time, one star eclipses (blocks out light from) the other as seen from Earth, causing some dimming. A slight dimming occurs when the brighter star eclipses the fainter star, and a more significant dimming when the fainter star eclipses the brighter one. The first eclipsing binary to be discovered was Algol, in the constellation Perseus. This actually consists of three stars, of which two regularly eclipse each other. Each time the fainter of the two eclipses the brighter, which occurs every 2.86 days, there is a roughly 70 percent dimming for about 10 hours. A different and somewhat unusual cause of extrinsic variability occurs where two closely orbiting stars in a binary system have acquired distorted, ellipsoidal shapes. These are called rotating ellipsoidal binaries (see right). An example is the bright star Spica (actually a pair of stars) in the constellation Virgo.
△ Eclipsing and ellipsoidal variables
In this type of variable, two stars that are orbiting a common center of gravity become distorted into ellipsoidal (egglike) shapes. Sometimes they appear side-on (as here) and at other times end-on (appearing smaller and rounder), which affects how bright they look from Earth.
◁ Binary orbit sequence These 10 frames from a movie made with a special infrared-sensitive camera show two young stars orbiting a shared center of gravity. The images were taken using the ADaptive Optics Near Infrared System (ADONIS) at the European Southern Observatory at La Silla, Chile.
△ Light curve of an eclipsing binary
Eclipsing binary stars are detected by regularly occurring apparent dips in a star’s brightness. These dips in brilliance occur when one of a pair of stars partially blocks the light coming from the other star, as seen from Earth. The biggest dip occurs when the dimmer of the two stars eclipses the brighter star.

Also known as the Ptolemy cluster, this array of around 80 stars lies in the constellation of Scorpius. Alhough 980 light-years away, it is easily seen with the naked eye.
△ Evolution in a globular cluster
In this example of cluster evolution, some of the first star generation (red) die. Material from them then forms a second generation (blue), more concentrated at the centre of the cluster. Gradually their orbits change, mixing them with the older red stars.
▽ Cluster distribution in spiral galaxies
Globular and open clusters exist in different parts of spiral galaxies like the Milky Way—globular clusters in the halo region, above and below the main disk, and open clusters in the galaxy’s disk and spiral arms.

A LARGE GROUP OF STARS BOUND TOGETHER BY
GRAVITY—ANYTHING FROM A DOZEN TO SEVERAL
MILLION STARS—IS CALLED A STAR CLUSTER. THE
MILKY WAY GALAXY CONTAINS THOUSANDS OF
THESE SPECTACULAR STAR AGGREGATIONS.
Star clusters fall into two types: globular and open. Globular clusters are ancient, dense cities of stars, some containing more stars than a small galaxy. Open clusters, in contrast, are young, contain far fewer stars, and are often the site of new star creation. Many open clusters, and a few globular ones, can be seen in the night sky with the naked eye. Both types can be a magnificent sight when viewed through binoculars or a telescope.
Globular Clusters
Globular clusters are groups of between 10,000 and several million mostly very old stars arranged roughly in a sphere. More than 150 clusters like this exist in the Milky Wayeach can last for 10 billion years. The stars in a cluster tend to be concentrated toward its center and move in random circular orbits around the center. Many globular clusters consist of a single population of stars that all have the same origin, similar ages, and chemical composition. However, some contain two or more populations that formed at different times—through some of the more massive stars in the initial population dying and materials from them being recycled into a second star generation.
Open Clusters
Open clusters are groups of up to a few thousand stars that were formed roughly at the same time from the same cloud of gas and dust. They are more loosely bound by gravity than globular clusters, and they survive for a shorter time—from a few hundred million up to a few billion years. Unlike globular clusters, which occur in all types of galaxies, open clusters are found only in spiral and irregular ones, where stars are actively being created. Around 1,100 clusters of this type have been identified so far in the Milky Way.

One of the largest and brightest globular clusters in the night sky, 47 Tucanae is located in the Southern Hemisphere constellation of Tucana.

The cluster’s central region is so crowded that many star collisions occur.

EXTRASOLAR
PLANETARY SYSTEMS
ANY GROUP OF PLANETS ORBITING A STAR OTHER THAN
THE SUN IS CALLED AN EXTRASOLAR PLANETARY SYSTEM.
THE INDIVIDUAL PLANETS CIRCLING AROUND IN THESE
SYSTEMS ARE CALLED EXOPLANETS.
More than 2,000 exoplanets have been discovered so far, mostly in the last ten years or so. About half are gas-dominated planets, about the size of Jupiter or Neptune in the Solar System, orbiting close to their host stars. These hellishly hot, star-snuggling gas giants are known as “hot Jupiters” or “hot Neptunes.” Many smaller, probably rocky, exoplanets have also been discovered—some about the size of Earth—as well as cold gas giants. The types of stars that exoplanets orbit vary from red dwarfs to Sun-like stars, red giants, and even pulsars. Perhaps the most remarkable fact about exoplanets is that they can be detected at all. Finding a body many light-years away that emits no light of its own and that orbits a much bigger, brighter body (a star) presents many challenges. So far, relatively few exoplanets have been imaged directly with telescopes, but around a dozen methods have been devised for detecting them indirectly. Three of the most successful of these methods are explained below.
▷ Transit method
This approach involves detecting miniscule dips in a star’s brightness, caused by transits (movements) of a planet across the face of the star. To do this, an extremely sensitive light-detecting instrument is used.
▷ Doppler spectroscopy An exoplanet’s orbit causes a “wobble” in the motion of its host star. As a result, light waves coming from the star are alternately slightly lengthened (making them look redder) and shortened (making them look bluer)—a measurable phenomenon.
▷ Gravitational microlensing
The gravity of a star can bend light coming from a more distant star. This means it can act like a lens and magnify the distant star as it appears from Earth. An exoplanet orbiting the lensing star produces detectable variations in the amount of magnification.
The host star of a hot Jupiter is usually white, yellow, or orange and roughly Sun-sized
△ Direct imaging
The star Fomalhaut has a disk of dust and gas around it, as shown above (the star itself has been blacked out). A planet in the disk has been directly imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope. The planet and its path are shown in the image to the right.

▷ Kepler-62 system
In 2013, the Kepler Space Telescope discovered five planets orbiting the star Kepler-62, which lies 1,200 light-years from Earth. Two of these planets orbit in an area known as the habitable zone (or “Goldilocks zone”), where temperatures are just right for water to exist at the surface.
△ "Hot Jupiters"
An exoplanet of this type orbits its host star at a distance of less than 46 million miles (75 million km), which is much closer than Jupiter orbits the Sun. It is scorched by its host star, producing extreme weather in its atmosphere.
Properties of Exoplanetary Systems More than half of known exoplanetary systems consist of a single star with a single planet orbiting it (in many of these there may be other, so far undetected, planets). However, as of February 2016, more than 500 multiplanetary systems—containing two or more planets—had been discovered. Some contain five, six, or in a few cases, seven planets. Of particular interest in any planetary system is its habitable zone. This is the region around the central star where temperatures are right for water—essential for life as we know it—to collect on the surface of any planet with a rocky surface. A planet that looks like it could be rocky and is in a star’s habitable zone is of extra interest because it could harbor life.

An artist’s impression of the five Kepler-62 planets is shown below: they are too far away to photograph. The two on the right may be rocky planets with surface water. Little is known about the others except for their size and the fact that their surface must be extremely hot.

These intriguing multiplanet systems are quite diverse in terms of the mix of different sizes of planets they contain, the types of host star, and the number of planets that orbit within the host star’s (or stars’) habitable zone. Hundreds have been found already, at distances ranging from a few light-years to thousands of light-years from Earth. Only a few of the systems that have been discovered bear much resemblance to our Solar System, although a handful contain one or more roughly Earth-sized planets within a star’s habitable zone, and so hold out the possibility of harboring life. But new systems are regularly detected, and data about the planets already found is frequently being updated, so this situation is constantly changing.

△ Elliptical galaxies
Elliptical galaxies, suchs as M60 (shown here with the spiral galaxy NGC 4647), are ball-shaped star systems created by countless stars in overlapping elliptical orbits tilted at a wide range of angles. They have very little of the gas needed to support new star formation, which leaves them dominated by long-lived, low-mass red and yellow stars. They range in size from sparsely populated dwarfs to vast “giant ellipticals,” which are the largest galaxies in the Universe.
GALAXIES
GALAXIES ARE FOUND IN A HUGE VARIETY OF SHAPES AND
SIZES, FROM COMPLEX SPIRALS LIKE OUR MILKY WAY TO
HUGE BALLS OF ANCIENT RED AND YELLOW STARS, AND
SHAPELESS CLOUDS OF GAS, DUST, AND NEWBORN STARS.
Galaxies are the only places in the Universe where matter is densely packed enough for stars to form, and most stars spend their whole lives within them. Held together by gravity, most galaxies are thought to have a supermassive black hole at their center.
Types of galaxies
American astornomer Edwin Hubble confirmed the existence of galaxies beyond the Milky Way in the 1920s. He subdivided them into several distinct types distinguished by a code of letters and numbers. Elliptical galaxies (types E0 to E7) are all roughly ball-shaped, but range from rounded spheres to elongated cigars. Today we know that they are dominated by old red and yellow stars. Spirals (types S and SB) are flattened disks with dense areas of star formation in the spiral arms, and older red and yellow stars in the center. Lenticulars (type S0) have a central hub surrounded by a disk, but no spiral arms, while Irregulars (type Irr I and II) are fairly shapeless clouds rich in star-forming material.
UNDERSTANDING THE COSMOS
△ M89
E0 galaxies, such as M89 in Virgo, are almost perfect spheres of stars. They include the brightest and largest giant elliptical galaxies.
△ M32
E2 galaxies, such as the Andromeda Galaxy’s satellite M32, have one axis noticeably longer than the other, and tend to be fainter than the brightest E0 galaxies.
△ M110
More elongated galaxies, such as M110, also a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy, are actually somewhat disk-shaped. The orbits of their stars are flattened in one plane due to rotation.
△ ESO 381-12
Lenticular (S0) galaxies have a central hub and a flattened disk of stars similar to those in spiral galaxies, but there is little new star formation due to a lack of gas.
Ellipticals

galaxies in our Universe as there are stars in the Milky Way Galaxy
△ Hubble’s tuning fork
Edwin Hubble arranged the various galaxy types in the shape of a musical tuning fork. He thought this illustrated the way that galaxies evolve over time, although the true story is rather more complex (see pp.62–63). Ellipticals are numbered according to their shape, with E0 the most round in shape. There are two distinct types of spiral galaxy—normal spirals (type Sc to Sc or Sd), in which the spiral arms emerge directly from the central hub, and barred spirals (SBa to SBc), in which the arms attach to the ends of a straight bar crossing the hub.



GALAXIES 51
△ NGC 7217
Spiral galaxies of type Sa, such as NGC 7217 in Pegasus, have a central hub of older stars surrounded by a disk of stars and gas. Concentrated waves of star formation create tightly wound arms.
△ M91
Type Sb spirals have less tightly wound spiral arms emerging directly from the hub. M91 in Coma Berenices has relatively faint spiral arms for a galaxy of this type.
△ M74
Sc spirals such as M74 in Pisces have more loosely wound arms but are generally as bright as types Sa and Sb. The loosest Type Sd spirals, however, are usually a lot fainter.
△ NGC 4921
Barred spirals follow the same general classifications as barless ones. SBa galaxies, such as NGC 4921 in Coma Berenices, have tightly wound spirals.
△ NGC 7479
Type SBb spirals, such as NGC 7479 in Pegasus, have a looser spiral structure but retain an obvious central bar emerging from either side of the nucleus.
△ M95
Type SBc galaxies have the loosest spiral arms, as seen in the beautiful M95, a barred spiral in some 38 million light-years away in Leo.
▷ NGC 1427A
Dwarf irregular galaxies are thought to play an important role in galaxy evolution. Their stars have relatively few heavy elements, and probably represent raw material left over from the early history of the Universe, which has only recently ignited into star formation. NGC 1427A, for example, is lit up by newborn bright stars whose birth was triggered by its plunge into the Fornax galaxy cluster.
Irregular galaxies
Irregular galaxies are relatively shapeless clouds of gas, dust, and stars. The best known examples are the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, which are the Milky Way’s brightest satellite galaxies. Irregulars are rich in the raw materials of star formation and are often undergoing intense bursts of starbirth that make them bright for their size. Larger irregular galaxies show signs of some internal structure, such as central bars or lone, poorly defined arms. Hubble classified these as Irr I galaxies, compared to the truly shapeless Irr II irregulars.

GALAXY TYPES
Spiral galaxy
At 21 million light-years away, the Pinwheel Galaxy (M101) is relatively close to Earth. It is also roughly 50 percent bigger than the Milky Way, making it is one of the few galaxies in which individual regions can be studied. The Pinwheel has an extensive system of spiral arms. It appears lopsided, with the core, or nucleus, offset from the true centre, probably as a result interactions with other galaxies in the past.
Barred spiral galaxy
This galaxy, NGC 1300, is considered the prototype of the barred spiral galaxy. Instead of spiralling all the way to the central nucleus, the galaxy’s two spiral arms are instead connected to each other by a straight bar of stars that includes the nucleus. This detailed Hubble Space Telescope image reveals that the nucleus has its own spiral structure. Gas in the bar is funneled inwards before spiraling into the nucleus.
Elliptical galaxy
Apart from a simple ball shape, elliptical galaxies show little structure. Giant ellipticals such as IC 2006, shown here in an image taken in visible light by the Hubble Space Telescope, initially formed billions of years ago and are thought to have grown larger as they absorbed satellite galaxies. Due to its age, IC 2006 is made up of old, low-mass stars and there is no, or minimal, star formation activity.
Lenticular galaxy
This type of galaxy is named after its overall lenslike, or “lenticular” shape. NGC 2787 is one of the closest lenticular galaxies to Earth. This visible-light image shows tightly wound, almost concentric lanes of dust encircling the galaxy’s bright nucleus. Several bright blobs of light can be seen on the edge of the galaxy. Each of these is, in fact, a cluster of several hundred thousand stars orbiting NGC 2787.

Irregular galaxy
Many irregular galaxies are what astronomers call “starburst galaxies,” characterized by waves of new star formation. NGC 4214 is one such galaxy. Its abundant supply of hydrogen gas is fueling the emergence of bright clusters of new stars, while the presence of older red stars provides evidence of earlier episodes of star formation.

54 UNDERSTANDING THE COSMOS
THE MILKY WAY
ALL THE STARS WE CAN SEE IN THE SKY LIE WITHIN THE CONFINES OF OUR
HOME GALAXY, THE MILKY WAY. THIS VAST STAR SYSTEM, CONTAINING
HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF STARS, IS A BARRED SPIRAL WITH A COMPLEX
STRUCTURE AND IS ABOUT 120,000 LIGHT-YEARS ACROSS.
The Milky Way’s visible stars form a disk centered on a bulging hub. Despite its vast diameter, the disk averages only a thousand light-years deep. From our point of view on Earth, we see many more stars looking across the plane of the disk than when we look “up” or “down” from the plane and out into intergalactic space. This is why we see our galaxy as a broad band whose countless faint and distant stars merge together in a milky band of light. The central bulge of the Milky Way is dominated by low-mass, red and yellow stars with a high metallicity (see p.29), but the surrounding disk is filled with gas, dust, and younger stars. As with all spirals, stars are scattered across the disk, but the brightest are concentrated into the spiral arms. Stars
◁ Cross section of the Milky Way
Seen from the side, the Milky Way consists of a disk of stars around a bulging hub some 8,000 light-years across. A broad halo region above and below the galaxy appears largely empty, but is home to globular star clusters, as well as stray high-velocity stars and hot gas ejected from the galactic plane.
Thin disk
Thick disk
Central Halo bulge
High velocity star
Globular clusters
The latest evidence suggests that the
Milky Way has four spiral arms—two major and two minor—with distinct
differences among their stars
orbit at different rates depending on their distance from the hub, so the arms cannot be permanent structures. Instead, they stand out because they are the active regions of star formation. Here, stars are born, and the most massive and luminous among them pass through their short life cycles before their orbits can carry them out into the wider disk.
Spiral arms
Astronomers have recently confirmed that the Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy. Its central hub is crossed by a rectangular bar of stars some 27,000 light-years in length. Our galaxy’s spiral arms are the result of stars, gas, and dust moving in and out of a spiral-shaped “traffic jam” called a density wave (see opposite).
Heart of the Milky Way
The central regions of our galaxy are hidden behind intervening star clouds and dust lanes, but X-rays and infrared can pierce the veil to reveal complex structures, giant star clusters, and an enormous black hole with the mass of several million Suns (embedded in the bright gas cloud to right of the image).



◁ Density wave
Spiral structure arises when orbits are pulled into alignments that offset slightly from one another, often due to tidal forces from another galaxy. As a result, orbits slow down and material packs together in spiral-shaped areas of higher density.
◁ Chaotic orbits
In a completely chaotic scenario, the orbits of objects within a galaxy would be aligned in a range of different directions, and no spiral structure would form. The example here shows the same number of orbits as the other two (left and right).
◁ Perfectly ordered orbits In an ideal situation, objects in elliptical orbits around a galaxy’s center would have their longest axes in perfect alignment with each other. Objects naturally move more slowly at the outer edges of their orbit when they are farther from the center.
FORMATION OF SPIRAL ARMS



MILKY WAY IN THE SPOTLIGHT
The Solar System is part of a barred spiral galaxy called the Milky Way Galaxy. In this wide-angle view, the Milky Way's plane is seen as an arc above the antennae of the Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array (ALMA) on the Chajnantor plateau in Chile. It glows with the light of a mass of distant stars interspersed with dusty nebulae and patches of glowing gas, where new stars are being born to join the existing billions that make up our galaxy.
ALMA’s 66 dishes are either 39 ft (12 m) or 23 ft (7 m) in diameter and observe the sky at wavelengths between the infrared and radio parts of the spectrum. ALMA sits at high altitude16,400 ft (5,000 m) above sea level—in a very dry region where the air contains hardly any water vapor to absorb the radiation. The thinness of the atmosphere above it and the low interference from other radio signals also make the plateau ideal for observing at these wavelengths.






58 UNDERSTANDING THE COSMOS
THE MILKY WAY
FROM ABOVE
OUR GALAXY IS A VAST DISK OF STARS ABOUT 120,000 LIGHT-YEARS
ACROSS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF STARS WE SEE IN OUR SKIES,
HOWEVER, ARE CONFINED TO A MUCH SMALLER NEIGHBORHOOD
AROUND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.
The Milky Way contains between 100 and 400 billion stars, most of which are dwarfs with only a fraction of the Sun’s mass. Nevertheless, the Galaxy's overall mass is between 1 and 4 trillion solar masses—far more than the combined mass of its stars. While much of the extra mass is accounted for by dust and gas in the galactic disk, all this normal matter is vastly outweighed by so-called dark matter (see pp.74–75). Studies suggest that there are at least 100 billion planets orbiting the stars, and perhaps many more. Most of the visible material is in a central bulge and a flattened disk just 1,000 light-years deep, with stray stars, globular clusters, and large amounts of dark matter in the halo region.
◁ Dust and magnetism
Although dust makes up a relatively small proportion of our galaxy’s composition, it plays an important role in the formation of stars and planets. What’s more, its particles tend to align in relation to local magnetic fields. Microwave emission from dust particles can therefore be used as a way of revealing the Milky Way’s overall magnetic field, as shown on this map from ESA’s Planck satellite.

Because the Milky Way is not a solid object, stars and other objects orbit the center at different speeds. If the distribution of mass matched the concentration of visible objects, then we might expect stellar speeds to fall off with distance like those of planets in the Solar System. In fact, they trail off much more slowly, which is an indication of dark matter lying beyond the visible disk.

◁ Central regions of the Milky Way
According to the latest research, the Milky Way’s central bulge is crossed by a bar of stars. Concentrations of gas and young stars trace the outlines of four spiral arms, although the exact structure is still uncertain. This map focuses on the central regions, where the Milky Way’s arms are at their brightest, but sparse outer arcs of stars and a halo of dark matter extend much farther out.



60
ACTIVE GALAXIES
MANY GALAXIES SHOW SIGNS OF ENERGY OUTPUT FROM THEIR
CENTRAL REGIONS THAT CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY STARS ALONE.
THESE ACTIVE GALAXIES APPEAR VARIED, BUT ALL CAN BE EXPLAINED
BY THE SAME MECHANISM.
Active galaxies generate vast amounts of energy—not only visible light but also as radio waves, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, and gamma rays—from regions near their center. These galaxies are divided into four major types: Seyfert galaxies, radio galaxies, quasars, and blazars. Seyfert galaxies are otherwise normal-looking spiral galaxies with a bright and concentrated source of radiation embedded in their center, and unusual overall energy output that cannot be explained through starlight alone. Radio galaxies, in contrast, are distinguished by two large clouds of radio-emitting gas on either side of a central galaxy (in some cases, narrow jets can be seen linking them to the heart of the galaxy). Quasars are very distant galaxies with an intense starlike source of light, far brighter than a Seyfert galaxy, at their center. They are also sources of radio waves,
and vary in brightness over hours or days. Finally, blazars are broadly similar to quasars, but have distinctive differences in their radiation that mark them out. Astronomers think that all these different types of activity are actually caused by the same kind of object—an engine called an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The speed at which AGNs change their energy output means that they can be no larger than our Solar System, and the only object capable of releasing such vast amounts of energy in such a small region of space is a superheated “accretion disk” of matter falling into a supermassive black hole. The amount of material falling into the black hole, and the AGN’s alignment as seen from our point of view on Earth, determine which type of active galaxy we see.
UNDERSTANDING THE COSMOS
△ Whole galaxy
From a distance, an active galaxy may be surrounded by two huge lobes of radio emission, created as jets of particles ejected from the central disk encounter gas in intergalactic space. When the central AGN is visible, its light output can dwarf that of the surrounding galaxy.
Radio lobes
Entire active region is just a few lightyears across
△ Dust torus
The active galaxy’s central regions are surrounded by a thick doughnut-shaped ring or torus of light-obscuring gas and dust. If we see this ring edge-on, then the surrounding radio lobes are the only visible sign of unusual activity, manifesting as a radio galaxy.
Tightly aligned jets of particles emerge from the AGN
Dust torus
△ Nucleus
At the heart of the active galactic nucleus is a supermassive black hole. With the gas of a million or more Suns, it pulls material to its doom, heating it to millions of degrees where it emits intense radiation. If the particle jet points directly toward Earth, the AGN creates a blazar.
Accretion disk
Supermassive black hole



△ The active Milky Way
Our own galaxy’s supermassive black hole has long ago swept up the material from its immediate surroundings and become dormant, but objects such as stray asteroids still occasionally wander into its grasp. When this happens, matter is violently torn apart, resulting in intense bursts of radiation.
Ancient nucleus
Light from quasars is redshifted by huge amounts, revealing, due to the expansion of the Universe (see pp.70–71), that they are billions of light-years away and incredibly bright. As a result we are seeing them during a much earlier stage of cosmic evolution. Astronomers suspect that most galaxies go through a quasar phase early in their history.

LOCAL GROUP COLLISION
The Milky Way is a member of a small galaxy cluster called the Local Group, alongside the spiral Andromeda Galaxy (M32), the smaller Triangulum spiral (M33), the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and several dozen dwarf galaxies of various types. Andromeda and the Milky Way are by far the heaviest galaxies in the group, and are being pulled together by gravity with ever increasing speed. Approaching at 68 miles (110 km) per second, the two galaxies
are doomed to a head-on collision in about 4 billion years, when the night skies of a future Earth may bear witness to the astonishing scene shown in this artist’s impression. Collisions between stars will be rare, but colliding gas clouds will trigger waves of new star formation, and as the mass of the two galaxies becomes concentrated at the center, the galaxies will form a single giant system, sometimes nicknamed “Milkomeda.”



64
△ Close encounter
Near misses between galaxies are even more common than direct collisions. During these events, tidal forces are created that strengthen features such as spiral arms.
△ Unwinding arms
As galaxies come together, the orbits of stars within them are disrupted. Spiral arms unwind and their individual stars are scattered into intergalactic space.
△ Starburst
Most stars end up in chaotic orbits while gas is rammed together in huge star-forming clouds. Anchored by supermassive black holes, the galactic cores merge together.
△ Elliptical ending
The heating effects of the collision drive gas away from the galaxy, choking off the burst of star formation and leaving an elliptical system dominated by fainter, longer-lived stars.
◁ The merger model
Today’s model of galaxy evolution suggests that galaxies pull in cool gas from their surroundings, but lose hot gas as they merge together. Merged spirals form ellipticals, which gradually accumulate new gas and pass through a lenticular phase before regenerating new spiral arms.

THE RELATIVELY SHORT DISTANCES BETWEEN SOME GALAXIES COMPARED
TO THEIR SIZE MAKES COLLISIONS FAIRLY COMMON. THESE SPECTACULAR
EVENTS TRIGGER HUGE WAVES OF STAR FORMATION AND PLAY A KEY
ROLE IN THE STORY OF GALAXY EVOLUTION.
When galaxies collide, the stars within them are so widely spaced that they rarely hit one another. However, huge clouds of star-forming gas smash together in head-on collisions that compress and trigger vast new waves of star formation. The powerful gravity of the coalescing gas pulls the stars back toward the center, causing the colliding galaxies to merge over hundreds of millions of years.
Galaxy evolution
There is evidence that galaxies change from one type to another over time—irregular galaxies were far more common in the early Universe, spirals dominate today, and elliptical galaxies are most common in the heart of
galaxy clusters (see pp.66–67). As a result, astronomers think that collisions play a key role in galaxy evolution: gas-rich spirals initially formed from smaller irregular galaxies, while ellipticals are created by collisions between spirals, which send their stars into chaotic orbits, trigger vast waves of new star formation, and ultimately drive gas away into intergalactic space, where it can no longer form new stars. Depending on the energy of the collision and the nearby environment, the merged galaxy’s gravity may be able to pull back sufficient material from its surroundings to generate a new disk, and eventually to restart star formation, creating a new spiral that will eventually become part of another merger.

Final result of mergers is a giant elliptical galaxy

Colliding galaxies
This pair of interacting galaxies, collectively named Arp 273, is around 300 million light-years from Earth in Andromeda. Arp 273 reveals the early stages of a galactic merger. One of the larger galaxy’s spiral arms is already unwinding into space, while the smaller galaxy is undergoing an intense burst of star formation, creating “super star clusters” that will evolve over time into globular clusters.

DOZEN TO A THOUSAND OR MORE GALAXIES GROUPED TOGETHER BY
GRAVITY. CLUSTERS BLEND AT THE EDGES TO FORM SUPERCLUSTERS,
CREATING WEBLIKE FILAMENTS AROUND APPARENTLY EMPTY SPACE.
Galaxy clusters are the largest structures in the Universe that are created by the force of gravity, pulling galaxies together over millions of light-years of space to form huge concentrations of mass and matter. Because of this, they tend to fill a fairly similar volume of space (10–20 million light-years across) regardless of how many galaxies they contain. Superclusters and even bigger structures reflect the large-scale distribution of matter caused by the Big Bang itself (see pp.70–71).
Types of clusters
The Milky Way Galaxy belongs to a low-density cluster called the Local Group—it is one of three large spirals surrounded by 50 or so smaller galaxies, most of which are tiny and faint dwarf systems. Most small clusters seem to follow this pattern and are dominated by spirals and irregular galaxies. However, clusters containing large numbers of galaxies are very different, tending to be dominated by elliptical galaxies full of red and yellow stars. This is an important clue that ellipticals are created by the collision and merger of other types of galaxies within dense clusters.
◁ Coma cluster
Roughly 320 million light-years from Earth, the Coma Cluster is a group of about 1,000 galaxies, most of which are elliptical or lenticular. This infrared image reveals large numbers of dwarf galaxies, too faint to detect in visible light.
△ Gravitational lensing
The huge concentration of mass in galaxy clusters gives rise to an effect known as gravitational lensing. Large masses alter the shape of space near to them (see p.73). Light passing through a massive galaxy cluster changes direction, so galaxies beyond the cluster look distorted and sometimes magnified.

Cluster gas
Images of dense galaxy clusters taken by orbiting X-ray telescopes reveal that much of the apparently empty space between galaxies in most clusters is filled with superheated gas at temperatures of 10 million degrees or more. This hot gas is thought to originate in the cluster’s individual galaxies, and to escape when it is heated up during collisions between cluster members. Hotter gas particles move faster and find it easier to escape from the gravity of their original galaxies, though not from the cluster as a whole. X-ray gas tends to accumulate at the center of a cluster over time, and is richest in the densest galaxy clusters, where it may weigh twenty times more than all the visible galaxies put together.
▷ Evolving cluster
This image of galaxy cluster IDCS J1426 combines visible, infrared, and X-ray views (in green, red, and blue respectively). It shows how the X-ray gas has largely disconnected from the visible galaxies, except where it concentrates around a recent galaxy collision.

Clusters form groups up to around 100 million light-years across called superclusters, typically centered on one or more particularly rich clusters. Our Local Group is an outlying part of the Virgo Supercluster, centered on the Virgo Cluster about 55 million light-years away.

Virgo cluster
The closest major galaxy cluster to Earth, the Virgo Cluster contains perhaps 2,000 galaxies scattered over the constellations Virgo and Coma Berenices. Its larger galaxies are a mix of spirals and ellipticals (with the latter formed by collisions between the former). Its largest member is the giant elliptical galaxy M87, which lies at the center of the cluster, about 53 million light-years from Earth.
Abell 383
The dense cluster Abell 383 lies about 2.5 billion light-years away and is a powerful source of X-rays, thanks to a vast cloud of superheated gas stripped away from its individual galaxies. The cluster’s enormous mass allows it to act as a gravitational lens, bending the space around it and deflecting the path of light rays from more distant galaxies to produce distorted arcs of light.
Stephan's Quintet
This group of five galaxies in Pegasus is deceptive. While four of its galaxies form a tight physical group some 290 million light-years from Earth, the blue spiral at upper left is actually a much nearer foreground object. The other four members—three spirals and an elliptical—will almost certainly merge into a single giant elliptical galaxy in the next billion years or so.
MOO J1142+1527
At a distance of 8.5 billion light-years from Earth, this monster cluster is so distant that its light has been redshifted (see p.72) almost to invisibility. As a result it was only discovered in 2015 when observations from two separate infrared space telescopes were combined. With a similar mass to El Gordo (see right), it may be one of just a handful of giant clusters that formed in the first few billion years of cosmic history.

THE EXPANDING
UNIVERSE
AS A GENERAL RULE, THE FARTHER A GALAXY IS FROM EARTH, THE
FASTER IT IS MOVING AWAY FROM US. THIS IS VITAL EVIDENCE THAT
THE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE IS STILL EXPANDING. AND WHAT’S
MORE, THAT EXPANSION IS ACCELERATING.
The key evidence for the expansion of the cosmos comes from the Doppler effect (a way of measuring the speed at which any light-emitting object is moving toward or away from Earth). This reveals that more distant galaxies are moving away from Earth more rapidly—a discovery best explained by the idea that space as a whole is expanding and carrying galaxies away from one another—rather like currants in a cake moving apart as the batter rises in the oven.
The Doppler effect and redshift
The Doppler effect is a shift in the wavelength and frequency of waves, such as sound or light, moving past an observer. In everyday life, we experience Doppler shift when an emergency vehicle’s siren speeds past: waves move past us more rapidly and the pitch is higher as it moves toward us, but they reach us more slowly as it retreats, so the pitch drops.
△ Redshift and blueshift
Light from galaxies moving away from us has its wavelength stretched and therefore appears redder. When nearby galaxies move toward us, their wavelengths are compressed and they appear bluer. These shifts can be precisely measured from the way they affect spectral lines in a galaxy’s light.

▷ Cosmic expansion
The expansion of the Universe is not simply a case of galaxies moving apart in space—most of it is caused by space itself expanding. This is a result of the Big Bang explosion that created not only matter but space and time themselves.

71
Mapping from redshift
Because more distant galaxies show larger redshifts (an effect called Hubble’s Law), redshift itself can be used as a way of estimating distance for large numbers of galaxies that are too distant to measure in other ways. Mapping the redshifts of galaxies in different parts of the sky shows how galaxy superclusters form a web of elongated chains and sheets, known as filaments, around vast and apparently empty regions, called voids.
△ Redshift Survey
This map from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey plots the redshifts of more than 200,000 galaxies across two broad swathes of sky, revealing structures that are hundreds of millions of light-years across. These structures are far too large to have formed by gravitational effects since the Big Bang. Instead they are thought to have been ingrained in the initial distribution of matter from which everything formed.
Lookback time
Although light is the fastest thing in the Universe, its speed is still limited, so that it crosses about 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion kilometers) in a year. Coupled with cosmic expansion, this transforms our telescopes into time machines. The farther we look across space, the longer light has taken to reach us, and the farther back in time we are looking. Hence the most distant galaxies appear the most ancient and primitive.
◁ Stretching space
On cosmic scales, most of the redshift in distant galaxies arises not from pure Doppler shift but also from the way that light has stretched in its passage across expanding space.
◁ Receding galaxy
Although light may take a certain time to pass between distant galaxies, by the time it arrives the two galaxies may be much farther apart. The true separation of galaxies is called their co-moving distance.
◁ Shifted to invisibility
The most distant objects of all—the very first stars and galaxies formed in the early days of the Universe—have undergone extreme redshift, which renders them invisible to even the most advanced telescopes.

SIZE AND
STRUCTURE OF
THE UNIVERSE
THE EXTENT OF THE UNIVERSE WE CAN SEE AROUND
US IS LIMITED BY THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND THE RATE
OF COSMIC EXPANSION, BUT THE UNIVERSE AS A
WHOLE GOES FAR BEYOND THESE LIMITS.
The Big Bang explosion that created the Universe some 13.8 billion years ago produced not just matter, but also space and time. As a result, there is a limit to how far we can theoretically see across space because we can only see regions whose light has had time to reach us. This places us at the center of a spherical bubble called our observable Universe, but space itself extends far beyond this boundary. In fact, every location in the cosmos is at the center of an observable Universe of its own.
Cosmic microwave background radiation
Immediately after the Big Bang, the Universe was an opaque, expanding fireball from which no light could escape. As a result, the most distant region of the cosmos that we can actually see corresponds to the period about 380,000 years later, when the “fog” of the early Universe cleared. Light from the edge of the fireball can still be seen if we look far enough in any direction, but during its 13.8-billion-year journey to reach us it has become redshifted (see p.70) so that the fireball’s light now makes the whole sky glow at microwave wavelengths.
Observable Universe
Our observations of the Universe are limited to those objects whose light has had time to reach us over the past 13.8 billion years. However, thanks to cosmic expansion (see pp.70–71), the farthest regions of the Universe are moving away from us at the speed of light itself. As a result, light from regions beyond the observable Universe will never be able to reach Earth, no matter how much time passes.
UNDERSTANDING THE COSMOS
△ Radiation map
The European Space Agency’s Planck satellite mapped variations in the microwave background radiation corresponding to infinitesimal temperature differences. These reveal tiny variations in the temperature and density of the earlier Universe, showing where structures were starting to form even at this early time.
△ Looking back in time
Looking farther away in space is one way of studying features of the young Universe that do not survive today. At great distances, we can see young galaxies busy forming, and soon we may even see radiation from the very first stars. The cosmic microwave background marks the earliest and most distant light radiation we can detect.

△ The visible edge
During the time their light has been traveling toward us, the expansion of space has carried distant objects even farther away. As a result, the most distant objects we can see at present in any direction are now about 46.5 billion light-years away.
Spacetime
Albert Einstein’s theories of special and general relativity explain the fabric of the Universe as a four-dimensional “manifold,” in which three familiar dimensions of space (length, breadth, and height) can be traded off with one another and with the fourth dimension of time itself. This is only apparent in extreme situations, such as when objects move at close to the speed of light, but also when large amounts of mass are present. According to Einstein, the force of gravity around massive objects is a result of the way they distort spacetime.
More than one universe
Our familiar cosmos certainly stretches beyond the limits of what we can see, but is this Universe the only one? Or, are we part of a wider multiverse? One theory, known as eternal inflation, suggests that our Universe is just one of many. Bursts of inflation energy, such as the one at the beginning of our Universe, are continuously producing new “bubble Universes.”
SIZE AND STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE
△ Warped space
The idea of spacetime is hard to visualize in four dimensions, but it gets easier if you visualize space as a flat rubber sheet. Massive objects create dents in the sheet (gravitational fields), and these deflect the paths of others moving nearby, or even rays of light (see p.64).
△ Shape of the Universe
The distortion of spacetime means that the amount of matter in the Universe affects the shape of the cosmos itself. If there’s enough mass then the Universe curves inward and is “closed.” If there’s too little mass, then spacetime curves out and the Universe is open. The discovery of dark energy (see p.74) suggests the latter is the case.
▷ Eternal inflation?
If our Universe is one of many created from the same raw material, then it’s possible that the walls of separate bubble Universes would occasionally collide and interact.

Mapping dark matter
Dark matter cannot be imaged directly, therefore much of our understanding of it comes from the effects of so-called gravitational lensing. This is the way in which concentrations of mass distort the fabric of spacetime and deflect the light rays from more distant objects. The distribution of dark matter around a galaxy cluster in Pisces called Cl 0024+17 is shown here in lighter blue.



75
DARK MATTER
AND DARK ENERGY
THE LUMINOUS MATERIAL OF THE UNIVERSE IS A TINY PART
OF ITS OVERALL COMPOSITION—IT ALSO CONTAINS LARGE
AMOUNTS OF INVISIBLE MASS KNOWN AS DARK MATTER, AND
ANOTHER MYSTERIOUS SUBSTANCE CALLED DARK ENERGY.
Since the 1930s astronomers have suspected the existence of dark matter. Such material is not just dark, but completely immune to interactions with light, and only makes its influence felt through the force of its gravity. More recently, cosmologists have found that cosmic expansion (see pp.70–71) is accelerated by an effect called dark energy, which seems to counteract gravity.
The nature of dark matter
The first evidence for dark matter came from two sources: the way that galaxies orbit inside galaxy clusters and the speed at which stars orbit in the Milky Way. Both suggest the Universe contains about five times more dark than luminous matter. Some of this may be accounted for by compact, faint objects such as dead stars and stray planets, but most of it probably consists of unknown subatomic particles—tiny objects that interact with normal matter only through gravity.
What is dark energy?
In the 1990s, cosmologists discovered that cosmic expansion, which began in the Big Bang (see pp.14–15) has sped up over time, rather than slowing down as we might expect due to the gravity of all the dark and luminous matter within the Universe. The substance that drives this expansion is known as dark energy, but it’s still poorly understood—it may be a “cosmological constant” (a uniform property of spacetime itself), or a “quintessence” (a localized force that can vary from place to place). Which theory is correct could have an important effect on the fate of the Universe.
DARK MATTER AND DARK ENERGY
△ Fates of the Universe
The precise balance between combined dark and luminous matter (whose gravity slows down the expansion of the Universe) and dark energy (which tends to speed up the expansion) will ultimately determine the way our Universe comes to an end.
△ Bullet cluster
This collision between two distant galaxy clusters reveals the motion of dark matter. Most of the cluster’s luminous matter takes the form of clouds of gas that emit X-rays (pink), but the distribution of dark matter (blue) broadly matches that of the visible galaxies (white).
▷ Composition of the Universe
Using Einstein’s famous equation E=mc2, cosmologists can estimate the overall balance between dark energy and the energy locked up in dark and luminous matter.

◁ Learning from light
Professional astronomers rarely use an eyepiece to look directly through a telescope. Instead, they use the instrument to channel light to various detectors. These can include digital cameras, photometers (which precisely measure the brightness of light from individual objects), and spectrometers that analyse colors of light, enabling scientists to learn about the chemistry of stars.
OBSERVING THE SKIES
LIGHT IS OUR MAIN SOURCE OF INFORMATION ABOUT DISTANT
OBJECTS IN THE UNIVERSE, AND GROUND-BASED TELESCOPES REMAIN
IMPORTANT TOOLS FOR CAPTURING LIGHT AND STUDYING FAR-AWAY
STARS AND GALAXIES.
Very few objects from space ever reach Earth, and most of those only come from our immediate planetary neighborhood. Studying light that reaches our planet from distant space is therefore one of the best ways of learning about objects in the wider Universe. Many other forms of radiation are absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere and astronomers use space-based observatories (see pp.80–81) to study objects in these other wavelengths. By gathering light across a large surface and concentrating it into a much smaller image, telescopes allow us to see objects that are much fainter than those we can see with the
unaided eye. Magnifying these small images then enables us to distinguish much finer detail. However, modern scientific telescopes are very different machines from those used by backyard stargazers. Most are reflector designs that use a series of mirrors to bring light onto converging paths and create a focused image on a detector instrument. The telescope is supported by a mount or cradle that swings back and forth and allows it to keep pace with the path of objects across the sky. A technique called interferometry allows astronomers to links two or more telescopes together and detect even finer details.
UNDERSTANDING THE COSMOS
▷ Refractor and reflector telescopes
The first telescopes, invented by Dutch eyeglass-makers in the Netherlands around 1609, used a lens-based refractor design. One lens (the objective) collects light and bends it to a focus, while another (the eyepiece) magnifies image. The simplest reflector designs, invented by Isaac Newton around 1668, use a curved mirror to collect light and direct it to a secondary mirror, which then directs it to a lens-based eyepiece.

◁ Radio telescopes
Radio signals from space were discovered in the 1930s and are measured today using enormous bowl-shaped antennae. The much longer wavelengths of radio waves mean they need a much bigger collecting surface to resolve fine details, but radio antennae can be linked together in arrays, like this one in New Mexico.
Research telescope
Most modern research telescopes, such as the European Extremely Large Telescope illustrated here, are located at mountaintop sites that put them above the bulk of Earth’s turbulent, lightabsorbing atmosphere. Using segmented mirrors increases a telescope’s collecting area and the faintness of objects it can image.



78
Hubble Space Telescope
The idea of placing a large optical telescope above Earth’s atmosphere, where it would experience perfect observing conditions, was suggested as early as 1946. The ability to repair and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit has kept it functional for more than a quarter century. While modest in size compared to today’s ground-based giants, Hubble’s location allows it to deliver both stunning images and revolutionary scientific discoveries.
Telescope arrays
A technique called interferometry allows for the combination of signals from several telescopes to mimic the resolving power of a single, impossibly large instrument. The technique was pioneered for use with the long-wavelength radio waves at the Very Large Array.
Segmented-mirror telescopes
The weight of traditional mirrors brought the growth of telescopes to a halt in the mid-20th century, but from the 1980s onward, engineering breakthroughs allowed telescopes to reach even bigger sizes. Key to this was the ability to align honeycomb-like mirror segments to mimic a single reflecting surface.
Orbiting observatories
The launch of the first X-ray astronomy satellite, Uhuru, heralded a new age of space-based astronomy, studying the Universe at wavelengths that are blocked by Earth’s atmosphere. These included not only X-rays but also ultraviolet and infrared radiation.
Aerial telescopes
One way of improving the magnification of telescopes was to use larger lenses separated by a greater distance. In the mid-17th century this led to enormous aerial telescopes with lenses suspended on open frames up to 150 ft (31 m) long.
Galileo's telescope
Galileo’s first lens-based telescope produced an image multiplied by a factor of three, but later designs improved rapidly. He used his instruments to make discoveries including mountains on the Moon, spots on the Sun, and countless stars invisible to the naked eye.

Dutch lensmaker Hans Lippershey is usually credited with inventing the telescope around 1608, but it was Italian physicist Galileo Galilei who first turned it toward the sky. Since then, telescope technology has gone through huge advances—the introduction of the mirrored reflector design, mounts that can keep a telescope in sync with the movement of the stars, spectroscopy to analyze the chemical fingerprints of starlight, and photography to keep a permanent record of observations. More recently, computer control and space-based observatories have helped push the limits of telescope technology.

79
James Webb Space Telescope
NASA’s successor to Hubble, the infrared James Webb Space Telescope, should allow us to see farther into the depths of the Universe than ever before. Its huge sunshield can protect it from not only solar heat but also radiation from the Earth.
Future giants
Currently under construction in Chile’s Atacama Desert, the European Extremely Large Telescope will have a primary mirror diameter of more than 129 ft (39.3 m)constructed out of 798 separate cells. It will only become operational in 2024.
Radio astronomy
American physicist Karl Jansky’s discovery of radio signals from the sky, associated with the rising and setting of the Milky Way, marked the beginning of radio astronomy. The long wavelength of radio waves means that very large collecting areas are needed.
William Herschel
From the late 18th century, British astronomer William Herschel developed new metals for his reflecting telescope mirrors. These allowed him to produce the finest telescopes so far, and to make new discoveries, including the planet Uranus.
Newtonian reflector
British physicst and mathematician Isaac Newton designed the first telescope that used a curved mirror rather than a lens to collect light. This permitted a much more compact telescope design called the Newtonian reflector.
Space-based astronomy
In the late 1940s, US astronomers used captured German V-2 war rockets to carry radiation detectors on short trips above Earth’s atmosphere. These confirmed that radiation from space, such as X-rays, is blocked by the atmosphere.
Hooker Telescope
The 8ft (2.5m) Hooker reflector at Mount Wilson Observatory was the first telescope to combine giant size with maneuverability. It remained the world’s largest telescope until 1949, and was key to the discovery of the expansion of the Universe.
1998 2014 2018

The European Southern Observatory’s VLT in Chile is made up of four separate 27 ft (8.2 m) reflecting telescopes. It marked a breakthrough in the manufacture of large single-element mirrors and can also combine light from multiple telescopes.

The Leviathan of Parsonstown
Irish astronomer William Parsons built this enormous reflecting telescope with a 6 ft (1.8 m) mirror on his estate at Birr Castle in Ireland, but it could only point in a limited range of directions because of the walls needed to support it. It remained the world’s largest telescope for more than 70 years.

SPACE TELESCOPES
TELESCOPES ORBITING ABOVE EARTH OPEN UP NEW VISTAS ON THE UNIVERSE.
THEY NOT ONLY REVEAL OBJECTS WHOSE INVISIBLE RADIATIONS ARE BLOCKED
BY OUR PLANET’S ATMOSPHERE BUT ALSO ALLOW ASTRONOMERS TO CARRY
OUT MORE PRECISE STUDIES IN VISIBLE LIGHT.
The visible light with which we view the Universe is simply a type of electromagnetic wave. These are packets of energy that move through space in the form of self-reinforcing electric and magnetic fields. The properties of light we perceive as colors depend on the wavelength of these waves, but the broader electromagnetic spectrum goes far beyond them to encompass much longer and shorter waves. Robotic space telescopes allow astronomers to study these elusive wavelengths, but they are often very different from Earth-bound instruments. For example, infrared telescopes need extreme cooling so that their own heat does not swamp the weak signals, while X-rays and gamma rays will pass straight through most traditional mirrored telescope designs.
△ Orbiting observatories
Many space telescopes are able to carry out their observations from an orbit around Earth itself. Others orbit at Lagrangian points 1 and 2, which allow spacecraft to hold the same position relative to Earth and Sun. The infrared James Webb Space Telescope, for instance, will orbit the Sun at L2, 932,000 miles (1.5 million km) beyond the Earth.
◁ Whole-sky surveys
While Earth-based telescopes are limited to viewing the parts of the sky that are visible from their particular latitude, space telescopes have no such restrictions. The Earth may block a large part of their view at any moment, but with enough time they can survey the entire sky and build up maps such as this one at infrared wavelengths

The visible light spectrum covers only a narrow range of wavelengths, between about 390 and 700 nanometers (billionths of a meter). Wavelengths shorter than the blue end of the spectrum include ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays, while those longer than red include infrared and radio waves (including microwaves). Only visible light and some radio waves reach Earth’s surface; most other waves are blocked at various levels in the atmosphere.

◁ Goldilocks zone
The most hospitable worlds around any star are likely to be Earth-like planets orbiting within a habitable “Goldilocks zone” around their stars, where temperatures are just right for liquid water to survive on the surface. A few such worlds have been identified, and they are probably abundant in the Milky Way.
◁ Transporting life
Some astronomers have speculated that life on Earth might not have needed to have evolved from scratch. Instead, either life itself, or at least complex chemicals that would help it get started, might be transferred between planets inside meteorites or comets.
▽ Hardy organisms
Tardigrades are tiny animals, also known as “water bears,” whose durability shows how life could persist in conditions very different from those on Earth’s surface. They can survive extremes in temperature and pressure, exposure to the vacuum of space, and bombardment with radiation.
THE SEARCH FOR LIFE
PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED BY THE POSSIBILITY
OF LIFE BEYOND EARTH, BUT THE ODDS OF ITS EXISTENCE,
AND THE PROSPECTS FOR ITS DETECTION, HAVE BEEN
GIVEN SEVERAL HUGE BOOSTS IN RECENT YEARS.
The search for life in the Universe has been transformed by the discovery of volcanically active ocean moons in our own Solar System, and countless exoplanets orbiting other stars, offering potential homes for different forms of life.
Requirements for life
Traditional theories assumed that life got started in the so-called “primordial soup” of a shallow, warm, chemical-rich seas on the surface of the early Earth. This appears to be the ideal condition to provide the three necessities of life: carbon-based chemicals, water, and an energy source in the form of sunlight. Today, the carbon and water requirements still seem reasonable, since they allow the development of complex chemistry. But the discovery of “extremophiles”—organisms that feed on chemical energy in the pitch darkness of deep-sea volcanic vents, or even deep inside hot subterranean rocks—have changed ideas about what life is, and the conditions it needs to survive.

▷ Messages in space
Two space probes launched in the 1970s, Pioneer 10 (1972) and Pioneer 11 (1973), carried plaques with a pictogram message. This message was meant for any intelligent life that might intercept or recover one of the probes at some point in the future.
▷ Drake's equation
In 1961, SETI pioneer Frank Drake devised the Drake Equation, a way of assessing the number of civilizations that might be communicating by radio signals in the Milky Way at any one time.
△ Seas of Enceladus
In 2005, NASA’s Cassini space probe discovered huge plumes of water ice erupting from Saturn’s small moon Enceladus, indicating a hidden ocean kept liquid by heating from powerful tidal forces. These make Enceladus one of the Solar System’s most likely habitats for life.
◁ Methane on Mars
Methane is a gas that can only be produced by living microorganisms or active volcanism. It breaks down rapidly on exposure to sunlight, so the recent discovery of methane patches in the atmosphere of Mars raises intriguing questions about the Red Planet.
Signature of life
Any form of life must sustain itself through a series of chemical reactions known as the organism’s metabolism and, over time, this inevitably transforms the environment of the planet around it. For example, oxygen is a naturally reactive chemical that tends to get locked away as mineral compounds within rocks, so Earth would have no oxygen in its atmosphere if not for the evolution of life and the metabolic reactions of photosynthetic plants and algae over billions of years. Atmospheric oxygen is therefore a potential chemical biosignature for life on other worlds. Astronomers have already measured the atmospheres of a few exoplanets, but future telescopes should make this far more common.
Intelligent life
The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) uses a variety of methods in the hope of tracking down evidence of intelligent aliens in the Universe. The most common is to scour the sky in search of artificial radio signals, but such signals are only likely to be found if aliens are deliberately beaming them toward us. Alternative approaches include looking for technosignatures (signs of technology), such as pollution in planetary atmospheres or even changes in the light output of stars created by alien engineering.

PATTERNS IN THE SKY
◁ Star trails
A whirling pattern of lights is seen in the sky above the Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile. The streaks are star trails captured by a longexposure photograph. Although the stars appear to circle the southern celestial pole, the movement is really that of the Earth rotating on its axis.
which storytellers could imagine the starry outlines
of gods, heroes, and mythical beasts. All civilizations
had their own constellations, based on their own
culture. Those we use today stem from a group of
48 known to the ancient Greeks around 2,000 years
ago. These were supplemented by others invented
by astronomers in the 16th to 18th centuries,
particularly in the far southern sky, which the
Greeks could not see. In the 1920s, the International
Astronomical Union, astronomy’s governing body,
officially recognized a total of 88 constellations that
fill the sky from pole to pole with no gaps between
them. Although constellations have outgrown their
original purpose in this age of computer-controlled
telescopes on Earth and in space, they still serve
as a useful way of identifying the general area of
sky in which a celestial object lies. They also provide
a connection with the original stargazers who first
looked at the sky and tried to understand the
Universe around them.
The first constellations were simple patterns of
stars, picked out by imaginative humans thousands
of years ago. A good knowledge of the sky had
practical uses. Bright stars and constellations were
navigation aids for travelers at night, their risings
and settings provided a simple clock, and their
annual progression around the sky acted as a
calendar. The sky also became a picture book in



88 THE CONSTELLATIONS

CHARTING
THE HEAVENS
PEOPLE HAVE OBSERVED THE HEAVENS FOR THOUSANDS
OF YEARS, AND MANY CULTURES HAVE LINKED THE
PATTERNS THEY DISCERNED AMONG THE THOUSANDS
OF VISIBLE STARS TO THEIR OWN MYTHOLOGY.
Today, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) recognizes 88 constellations and together the constellations form a complete sphere (see pp.94–95) around the Earth. Our modern system of constellations is based on the 48 figures described by the ancient Greek astronomer Ptolemy. Other civilizations also visualized patterns in the sky and linked those to their myths and legends, but only the Greek system is recognized today. It was not until the 16th century, when sailors started to navigate and explore the Southern Hemisphere, that whole new areas of the celestial sphere were mapped and new constellations created.



CHARTING THE HEAVENS 89
Star cataloguing from space
A European Space Agency satellite called Hipparcos, named in memory of Hipparchus, compiles a catalog from orbit of the positions, motions, and brightnesses of over 100,000 stars with unprecedented accuracy.
The Galaxy in 3D
The European observatory Gaia is launched. It will spend five years measuring the distances and motions of over a billion stars to build up a threedimensional map of our Galaxy.
The final list
The newly formed International Astronomical Union (IAU) fixes the number of recognized constellations at 88, covering the entire celestial sphere, and draws up official boundaries for them. From now on, no more constellations can be added.
Dürer’s star chart
Albrecht Dürer draws the first European printed star chart, based on the catalogue in Ptolemy’s Almagest. One half depicts the zodiac and northern constellations, the other shows the southern sky. Constellations are shown reversed, as on a celestial globe.
The Almagest
Greek astronomer Ptolemy produces a summary of Greek astronomy called the Almagest, which includes a revised version of Hipparchus’s star catalogue with 48 constellations. It is the standard work on Western astronomy for nearly 1,500 years.

First great star catalogue
Hipparchus, a Greek astronomer, compiles the first great star catalogue of antiquity, grouping 850 stars into over 40 constellations. Hipparchus also divides the stars into six levels of brightness, the origin of the system of stellar magnitudes.
Tycho Brahe
Tycho Brahe, a Danish astronomer, produces a new and improved catalogue of over 1,000 stars, ten times more accurate than the one in Ptolemy’s Almagest. He still uses naked-eye sighting instruments, as the telescope has not yet been invented.
Arabic star charts
Al-Sufi, a Persian astronomer also known in the West as Azophi, produces an updated version of the Greek Almagest, entitled The Book of the Fixed Stars. This includes
illustrations of each constellation, something the Almagest lacked, drawn in Arabic style.

Greatest star atlas
The greatest of the old-style pictorial star atlases is published in 1801 by Johann Elert Bode, director of Berlin Observatory. Called Uranographia, it contains 17,000 stars divided into over 100 constellations, five of them invented by Bode himself.

90 THE CONSTELLATIONS
THE CELESTIAL SPHERE
ALTHOUGH STARS LIE AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES FROM
EARTH, FOR RECORDING THEIR POSITIONS IN THE SKY IT
IS HELPFUL TO PRETEND THAT THEY ARE ALL STUCK TO
THE INSIDE OF A VAST SPHERE THAT SURROUNDS EARTH.
This enormous imaginary globe is known as the celestial sphere. Every star in the sky other than the Sun, as well as other very remote objects such as galaxies, has a position on the surface of this sphere that remains more or less “fixed”—that is, it hardly changes except over extremely long periods of time. Other, closer objects, such as the Sun and other Solar System bodies, do appear to continuously “wander,” at varying speeds, against the background of stars on the celestial sphere, but they do so in a predictable way.
The sky as a sphere
Like the real sphere of the Earth, the celestial sphere has north and south poles, an equator, and the equivalent of latitude and longitude lines. It is like a celestial version of the globe. The positions of stars and galaxies can be recorded on it as well, just as cities on Earth have their positions of latitude and longitude on a globe. The idea of the sphere also helps astronomers, or indeed anyone, better understand how their location on Earth, the time of night, and the time of year affect what can be viewed in the night sky.

△ Imaginary sphere
The celestial sphere is a purely imaginary concept, with a specific shape but no particular size. Astronomers use exactly defined points and curves on its surface as references for describing or determining the positions of stars and various other types of celestial object.

△ The ecliptic
One of the major circles on the celestial sphere is called the ecliptic. It marks where the ecliptic plane (the plane on which Earth orbits the Sun) meets the sphere’s surface. In their motion—as seen from Earth—against the backdrop of stars on the sphere, the Sun always remains on, and planets stay close to, the ecliptic.

Unlike other stars, our local star continuously moves on the celestial sphere, although always confined to the line called the ecliptic

△ Apparent motion at the North Pole
From the observer’s viewpoint, the stars seem to circle counterclockwise around a point directly overhead—the north celestial pole. Stars near the horizon move around the horizon.
△ Apparent motion at Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes
For this observer, most stars rise in the east, cross the southern sky, and set in the west. But stars in the northern part of the sky circle counterclockwise around the north celestial pole.
△ Apparent motion at the equator
For an observer standing on or close to the equator, the stars appear to rise vertically in the east, swing overhead, and then drop vertically down again and set in the west.
Apparent star movement
A person standing still and looking up at the night sky sees a slow, curving movement of stars and other objects across the sky. This apparent motion occurs because Earth is spinning within the celestial sphere. The pattern of motion seen varies according to the observer’s location. Movements appear similar in both hemispheres, except that in the Northern Hemisphere stars appear to circle counterclockwise around the north celestial pole, while in the Southern Hemisphere they circle clockwise around the south celestial pole.

Celestial coordinates
Astronomers can record the position of any object on the celestial sphere using a system of coordinates similar to that of latitude and longitude. The coordinates used by astronomers are called declination and right ascension. Declination is measured in degrees north or south of the celestial equator. Right ascension is measured in degrees east of the celestial meridian—a line that passes through both celestial poles and a point on the celestial equator called the First point of Aries.

92 THE CONSTELLATIONS
THE ZODIAC
ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT OBVIOUS BECAUSE OF THE SUN’S GLARE, AS
EARTH ORBITS THE SUN, THE SUN SEEMS TO MOVE AGAINST THE
BACKDROP OF STARS, ALWAYS STAYING WITHIN A BAND OF
THE CELESTIAL SPHERE CALLED THE ZODIAC.
During the course of this annual journey around the celestial sphere, the Sun moves along a circle called the ecliptic (see p.90). An imaginary band around the celestial sphere that extends for about 8–9° on either side of the ecliptic is called the zodiac. The ecliptic passes through 13 constellations that lie, at least in part, in the zodiac and these are known as zodiacal constellations. The astrological zodiac is divided into 12 equal segments, called “signs,” and excludes the constellation Ophiuchus. The Sun spends a period of time in each zodiacal constellation but the dates it does so do not correspond with those ascribed
to the astrological signs. This is due to the effects of precession and because the constellations are not all the same size. Whenever the Sun is moving through a particular area of the zodiac, the stars in that part of the celestial sphere cannot be seen because of the glare. Rather, the most easily observed parts of the celestial sphere are always those on the opposite side to Earth from the Sun. These are the parts visible in the middle of the night. Over the course of a year, as Earth orbits the Sun, the portions of the celestial sphere—including the different parts of the zodiac—that can be viewed from Earth at night quite dramatically alter.
▷ June and December night skies
At opposite sides of Earth’s orbit around the Sun, an observer standing on the equator will be able to view exactly opposite parts of the celestial sphere at midnight. Shown here, for example, are the parts that can be seen at midnight during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer solstice in June (yellow) and during the winter solstice in December (blue).

94 THE CONSTELLATIONS
▷ The constellations
For millennia, humans have joined stars with imaginary lines to make recognizable patterns, or constellations. These patterns include the outlines of animals and mythical beasts and heroes. In the early 20th century, the International Astronomical Union gave formal definition to 88 constellations, giving them official names and setting the positions of their boundaries. In this modern system, a constellation is an area of sky rather than a pattern of lines between stars.
The celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere surrounding Earth
Constellation boundaries are straight and either horizontal or vertical
▽ Observer’s location
From a particular place on Earth, up to half of the celestial sphere can be seen at any one time, with the rest hidden by the Earth itself. Whether or not a particular constellation is visible also depends on an observer’s location. For example, all of the constellation Canis Major can be seen between latitudes 56 degrees north and the south pole. From a belt to the north of this, only part of the constellation can be seen, while in the region around the north pole, none of the constellation is visible.

MAPPING THE SKY
TO FIND OBJECTS IN SPACE AND TO MAKE MAPS OF THE SKY,
ASTRONOMERS USE A FRAME OF REFERENCE CALLED THE CELESTIAL
SPHERE. THIS SPHERE IS AN IMAGINARY SHELL, CENTERED ON THE
EARTH, UPON WHICH ANY OBJECT IN THE SKY CAN BE LOCATED.
We know that objects in space can lie at any distance from Earth, but in order to position them on a map we can think of them as all being stuck to the inside of the celestial sphere. Just like the Earth itself, the sphere can be divided up with lines of longitude and latitude, including an equator. Similarly, just as the land area of the Earth is separated into countries, the celestial sphere is divided into areas called constellations.

SKY CHARTS
CHART 1
NORTH POLAR SKY
THE SIX CHARTS ON THE FOLLOWING PAGES COVER THE WHOLE
CELESTIAL SPHERE; ONE FOR EACH OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH
POLAR REGIONS, AND FOUR FOR THE BELT OF SKY BETWEEN.
Together, the six charts show the entire sky surrounding Earth and the location of all 88 constellations. The two circular maps shown here are each centered on a celestial pole. The other four maps on the following pages cover the equatorial regions; each is centered on a quarter of the celestial equator. Individual constellations are profiled in the pages following the maps.
Centered on the north celestial pole, this chart shows the constellations of the north polar sky. It covers the area from declination 90° at the pole, southward to declination 50°. The star Polaris, in Ursa Minor, is less than 1° from the pole and almost in the center of the chart. Polaris and the other stars around it are circumpolar; they never set below the horizon for observers in the Northern Hemisphere. How much of the sky is circumpolar depends on the observer’s latitude; the amount increases the farther north you are.
THE CONSTELLATIONS
Constellation chart key
The individual constellation charts show each main star of the constellation, including the stars that make up its pattern and other notable stars. The apparent magnitude (brightness) of the stars is indicated by the key shown right. The charts also include key deep-sky objects, such as galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters, the symbols for which are also shown in the key on the right.
Visibility, magnitude, and distance
Each constellation has a data panel, which gives key information about the constellation, including the latitudes from where it is fully visible, and the months when it is highest in the sky. Each of the main stars has a brightness symbol together with its apparent magnitude, and a distance symbol with its
distance from Earth in light-years. Brightness Distance

CHART 2
SOUTH POLAR SKY
Centered on the south celestial pole, this chart shows the constellations of the south polar sky. It covers the area from declination -90° at the pole, northward to declination -50°. The sky around the pole is lacking in bright stars, and no one star is close enough to identify the pole’s position. Stars in the area around the pole are circumpolar for observers in the Southern Hemisphere; they remain visible in the night sky, never setting below the horizon. The farther south the observer is located, the greater the amount of sky that is circumpolar.

CHART 3
EQUATORIAL SKY
The region of sky in this chart is best placed for observation on evenings in September, October, and November. The map is centered on a part of the celestial equator that is crossed by the ecliptic, the Sun’s path. The crossing point is where the Sun moves from the southern to the northern sky in late March each year. It is the point where lines of right ascension are measured from, and is the celestial equivalent of 0° longitude on Earth.

Consisting of seven main stars arranged in a saucepan shape, Ursa Minor resembles a small version of the Big Dipper, hence its popular name of the Little Dipper. In Greek mythology, it represents a nymph who nursed the god Zeus as an infant. Polaris, its brightest star, lies very near the north celestial pole and is an easy guide to finding north at night.
Cepheus was supposedly the King of Ethiopia, a mythical country on the eastern Mediterranean, not the African country we know today. He was the husband of Cassiopeia, who lies next to him in the sky, and the father of Andromeda. The constellation’s most important features are two famous variable stars. Delta Cephei was the first of the pulsating stars known as Cepheid variables to be discovered. In 1784, the English amateur astronomer John Goodricke noted variations in its brightness, which cycles from magnitude 3.5 to 4.4 and back every 5 days 9 hours. It is also a triple star, with one fainter companion visible through a small telescope. Mu Cephei, another variable, is known as the Garnet Star because of its strong red color. A red supergiant, it ranges between magnitudes 3.4 and 5.1 approximately every two years.

DRACO THE DRAGON
DRACO WINDS NEARLY HALFWAY AROUND
THE NORTH CELESTIAL POLE. IT IS MOST
EASILY IDENTIFIED BY THE PATTERN OF THE
FOUR STARS THAT MARK ITS HEAD.
Draco represents the dragon of ancient Greek mythology that was killed by Hercules as one of his 12 labors. In the sky, Hercules kneels next to the dragon, with one foot on its head. Despite its large size, Draco is not a particularly prominent constellation. Its brightest star, Gamma—popularly known as Etamin or Eltanin—is of only 2nd magnitude. The constellation contains many double stars divisible by small telescopes or even binoculars, including Nu, a 5th-magnitude pair; Psi, a 5th- and 6th-magnitude pair; 16 and 17 Draconis, both of 5th magnitude; and 40 and 41 Draconis, both of 6th magnitude. Draco’s comparatively few notable deep-sky objects include the Cat’s Eye Nebula (NGC 6543) and the distorted spiral Tadpole Galaxy (UGC 10214).

CASSIOPEIA
THE VAIN QUEEN
CASSIOPEIA LIES WITHIN THE BAND OF THE MILKY WAY. ITS
FIVE MAIN STARS FORM A ZIGZAG SHAPE RESEMBLING THE
LETTER "W" THAT MAKES THIS CONSTELLATION EASY TO
RECOGNIZE IN THE NORTHERN SKY.
Cassiopeia was a vain queen of Greek mythology, the wife of King Cepheus. As punishment for Cassiopeia’s vanity, the sea god Poseidon sent a monster to ravage her country’s coastline. To rid themselves of the monster, Cassiopeia and Cepheus chained their daughter Andromeda to a rock as a sacrifice. Fortunately, she was rescued from the monster’s jaws by the hero Perseus. All the characters in this myth are represented by constellations close together in the night sky. Cassiopeia contains the remains of two supernova explosions. One, called Tycho’s Star, became visible from Earth in 1572. The other occurred about a century later, but went unseen at the time. The major features of the constellation for users of small telescopes are the beautiful double star Eta Cassiopeiae and several open clusters of stars, notably M52, M103, and NGC 457.
THE CONSTELLATIONS
50,000 BCE
50,000 CE
100,000 CE
◁ Changing shape
All stars are moving through space, so constellation patterns gradually change with time. These diagrams show the stars that make up Cassiopeia 50,000 years ago (top) and how it will appear in 50,000 and 100,000 years from now (center and bottom).
◁ Cassiopeia A supernova remnant The strongest radio source in the sky, Cassiopeia A has been identified as the remains of a supernova explosion some 11,000 light-years away. Light from the supernova should have reached Earth in the 1600s. However, there is no record of it having been observed, so it was probably dimmed by the surrounding dust. This image of the exploded star is a composite of observations made at infrared (red), optical (yellow), and X-ray (green and blue) wavelengths.
▷ Star distances
One might be forgiven for thinking that the five main stars in Cassiopeia’s distinctive “W” formation are relatively close together, but in fact they lie at greatly differing distances from Earth. The farthest away, Gamma Cassiopeiae (the central star in the “W”), is more than ten times more distant than the nearest of the five to us, Caph (Beta Cassiopeiae)

THIS NORTHERN CONSTELLATION FILLS A BLANK AREA
OF SKY BETWEEN URSA MAJOR AND AURIGA. THE LYNX IS
DRAWN AROUND A CHAIN OF STARS THAT STRETCHES FROM
ITS NOSE TO ITS TAIL.
Johannes Hevelius, the Polish astronomer who defined this constellation in 1687, was renowned for his sharp eyesight. He noted that only those who were as sharp-sighted as cats would be able to see it. Most naked-eye observers will see little more than its brightest star Alpha. With a telescope, interesting double and multiple stars can be seen, such as the triple star 19 Lyncis, which consists of two stars of 6th and 7th magnitude and a wider 8th-magnitude companion. Notable deep-sky objects are the distant globular cluster NGC 2419 and the huge star-forming region known as the Lynx Arc.

OCCUPYING AN AREA OF SKY BETWEEN CASSIOPEIA AND THE “HEAD”
OF THE GREAR BEAR (URSA MAJOR), CAMELOPARDALIS LACKS BRIGHT
OBJECTS AND IS BEST FOUND BY FIRST LOCATING ITS NEIGHBORS.
Left blank by the ancient Greeks, this large and barren region of northern sky contains no stars brighter than 4th magnitude. The gap was eventually filled in 1612 when Dutch theologian and astronomer Petrus Plancius drew a giraffe around some of its stars. Its front legs, body, and back legs fit around an inverted “U” shape of stars. The giraffe’s distinctive neck is drawn around no particular stars and stretches up toward Draco. The constellation’s most notable feature is a trail of unrelated stars called Kemble’s Cascade that lead away from NGC 1502 toward Cassiopeia.

▷ Star distances
Ursa Major’s main pattern stars lie between 29 and 358 light-years away from Earth. The two stars that form the ends of the Plough asterism—Dubhe and Alkaid—are 123 and 104 light-years away, respectively. The other five stars of the asterism—Merak, Phad, Megrez, Alioth, and Mizar—all lie at similar distances (about 80–86 light-years away) and are moving in the same direction through space. They form what is known as the Ursa Major Moving Group, a former open cluster that has drifted apart.

URSA MAJOR THE GREAT BEAR
THE THIRD-LARGEST CONSTELLATION, URSA MAJOR
IS BEST KNOWN FOR CONTAINING THE BIG DIPPER
(ALSO CALLED THE PLOUGH), PROBABLY THE MOST
FAMOUS STAR PATTERN IN THE ENTIRE SKY.
Seven stars make up the familiar ladle-shaped pattern known as the Big Dipper: Dubhe, Merak, Phad, Megrez, Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid. The second star in the handle of the dipper is a wide double. The brighter of the pair is Mizar, and its companion is Alcor. Two stars in the bowl of the dipper, Merak and Dubhe, point toward the north pole star, Polaris, in nearby Ursa Minor, the Little Bear. Ursa Major also contains several interesting deep-sky objects. These include M101, a face-on spiral also known as the Pinwheel Galaxy; M81 and M82 (also called the Cigar Galaxy), a pair of galaxies that are thought to have had a close encounter about 300 million years ago; and the planetary nebula M97, popularly called the Owl Nebula because of its resemblance to an owl’s face.
THE CONSTELLATIONS
◁ NGC 3982
Pink clouds of glowing hydrogen gas stand out along the spiral arms of this face-on spiral galaxy, nearly 70 million light-years away. Like the bright nebulae in our own galaxy, these clouds are areas where stars are being born, while the bluer regions consist of hot young stars. NGC 3982 is about 30,000 light-years wide, nearly one-third of the diameter of the Milky Way.
◁ M82
Popularly known as the Cigar Galaxy, this is undergoing a huge surge in star formation as a result of an interaction with its neighboring galaxy, M81. Plumes of hot, ionized gas (red in this Hubble image) are being blasted out above and below the disk of the Cigar Galaxy. Situated in the northern part of Ursa Major, both galaxies are 12 million light-years from Earth.

THE CONSTELLATIONS
CANES VENATICI
THE HUNTING DOGS
BETWEEN BOÖTES AND URSA MAJOR LIES THE CONSTELLATION CANES VENATICI,
REPRESENTING A PAIR OF HUNTING DOGS HELD ON A LEASH BY BOÖTES. SEVERAL
REMARKABLE GALAXIES LIE WITHIN ITS BORDERS, MOST NOTABLY M51, POPULARLY
KNOWN AS THE WHIRLPOOL.
Not recognized by the ancient Greeks, the constellation Canes Venatici was introduced in 1687 by Johannes Hevelius, a Polish astronomer who invented several new sky figures. He imagined it as two hounds held on a leash by the adjacent Boötes, the Herdsman. This constellation has few stars of note. Its brightest star was named Cor Caroli (Charles’s Heart) in the 17th century to commemorate King Charles I of England, who was beheaded by the republican parliament in 1649.
Near the constellation’s upper border with Ursa Major lies M51 (see pp.114–15), a face-on spiral galaxy. Its spiral structure was first detected in 1845 by an Irish astronomer, Lord Rosse, using a telescope he had built himself at his home at Birr Castle, County Offaly. Rosse’s discovery led to speculation that such spiral objects could be separate galaxies far off in space. In the case of M51, the distance is about 30 million light-years. A smaller galaxy, called NGC 5195, lies near the end of one of its arms.

THE WHIRLPOOL GALAXY
Grand spiral
Long lines of stars and dust-laced gas wind round the center of the M51, known as the Whirlpool Galaxy. The arms are star-forming factories where hydrogen gas is compressed and new stars are born. The young hot stars make the arms look bluish, and cause clouds of hydrogen to glow pink. The small galaxy (NGC 5195) at right is passing behind the Whirlpool, triggering star formation as it glides by.
Galaxy core
When seen imaged in X-rays, the galaxy’s core shines brightly. This image, taken by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, reveals vast clouds of multi-million degree gas at either side of it. The cloud at upper left of the bright central core is 1,500 light-years across. The gas is heated by a high-velocity jet of material accelerating away from a supermassive black hole within the galaxy’s nucleus.
Inside the core
This Hubble Space Telescope image takes us to the very heart of the galaxy—the active galactic nucleus (AGN) of its central core. The dark “X” silhouetted against the bright nucleus marks the exact location of a black hole, but hides it and its disk of infalling hot gas from view. The broad line of the X is a dust ring 100 light-years across lying at right angles to the galaxy’s disk.
X-ray view
More than 400 X-ray sources are revealed in this image of the Whirlpool by the space-based Chandra X-ray Observatory, which took 11 hours of observation to create. Most are X-ray binary star systems in which a neutron star, or more rarely a stellar black hole, captures material from an orbiting companion star. The infalling material heats to millions of degrees, producing a luminous X-ray source.

Dusty galaxy
Most of the galaxy’s starlight is invisible when viewed in near-infrared light. Instead we see the Whirlpool’s dust structure, shown here in red. The dust is tied up in smooth, diffuse dust lanes, rather than large dust clouds. These lanes are punctuated by hundreds of tiny clumps of stars, not seen in optical images because their light cannot penetrate the dark dust enshrouding them.

◁ NGC 5548
Lying face-on to us, NGC 5548 is a lenticular galaxy 250 million light-years away. A supermassive black hole is at the center of its brilliant core. Unusually, however, a clumpy gas stream flowing outward from the center is blocking most of the X-rays emitted by the black hole.

THE CONSTELLATIONS
A DISTINCTIVE KITE-SHAPED PATTERN IN
THE NORTHERN SKY, BOÖTES IS HOME TO
ARCTURUS, ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST AND
CLOSEST STARS TO US.
A large constellation, Boötes extends from Draco and Ursa Major in the north to Virgo in the south. Myths differ about what exactly Boötes represents but he is often taken to be a herdsman who is driving away two bears—represented by the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor—with the aid of his dogs, represented by the adjacent constellation Canes Venatici. Boötes’ brightest star is Arcturus, which is “bear guard” or “bear keeper” in Greek. It is the brightest star north of the celestial equator. Boötes is also noted for its double stars. The best is Izar, one of the most beautiful doubles in the sky. The Quadrantid meteor shower, named after Quadrans, an obsolete constellation that once took up part of Boötes, radiates from this area of sky every January.

CORONA BOREALIS
A HORSESHOE-SHAPED PATTERN OF STARS
REPRESENTING A MAGNIFICENT CROWN,
CORONA BOREALIS IS A SMALL BUT DISTINCTIVE
CONSTELLATION IN THE NORTHERN SKY.
One of the original 48 constellations of ancient Greece, Corona Borealis represents the jewel-studded crown worn by the mythical Princess Ariadne of Crete at her wedding to the god Dionysus. Newly married, Dionysus tossed the crown into the sky, where its jewels became stars. The crown shape is drawn around seven linked stars. Found between Boötes and Hercules, it is easily spotted despite the relative faintness of its stars. Corona Borealis contains interesting double stars and variables. It is also host to several galaxy clusters, including SDS J1531+3414 and Abell 2065. The latter contains more than 400 galaxies but is 1.5 billion light-years away and is too faint to be visible with most amateur telescopes.

▷ Star distances
The nearest of Hercules’s main pattern stars, Mu (μ) Herculis, is only 27 light-years away while the farthest is Theta (θ) Herculis, at about 758 light-years. Coincidentally, these are also the least and most luminous of the pattern stars. Mu emits as much energy as about three Suns whereas Theta emits the equivalent of about 1,330 Suns.
◁ Hercules A
Jets of gas a million light-years long shoot out from Hercules A, an elliptical galaxy about two billion light-years away. Although invisible at visiblelight wavelengths, the jets can be detected at radio wavelengths and can be seen clearly in this combined visible-light and radio-wave image. The jets are thought to be powered by a black hole with a mass of about 2.5 billion Suns at the galaxy's center.
△ M13
The brightest globular cluster in the northern sky, M13 lies about 25,000 light-years away and contains an estimated 300,000 stars. It is just visible to the naked eye; with small telescopes, details such as chains of stars are visible.

LYING BETWEEN LYRA AND BOÖTES. ITS MOST NOTABLE FEATURES ARE
GLOBULAR STAR CLUSTERS, INCLUDING M13, WHICH IS GENERALLY REGARDED
AS THE FINEST IN NORTHERN SKIES.
Hercules is oriented with his feet pointing north and his head in the south. He represents the strongman of ancient Greek mythology who was ordered to undertake 12 epic labors. Among them was slaying a dragon, and in the sky Hercules is visualized with his left foot over the dragon’s head, represented by the constellation Draco to the north. Hercules’s head is marked by the star called Rasalgethi, which is a red giant of variable brightness. Although Rasalgethi is labeled Alpha Herculis, the constellation’s brightest star is Beta Herculis, also known as Kornephoros.

120 THE CONSTELLATIONS
△ M56
This globular cluster is a ball of ancient stars just over 30,000 light-years from the Sun. It requires a fair-sized telescope to be seen well. Studies of the chemical composition and age of the stars in the cluster suggest that it was once part of an older dwarf galaxy that subsequently merged with the Milky Way.
▽ Structure of M57 (Ring Nebula)
From our viewpoint on Earth, the planetary nebula M57 looks like a smoke ring around a central star. Seen side-on, though, it would look more like the diagram above. A doughnut-shaped ring of gas with denser knots in it is expanding away from the central star’s equator, while fainter lobes of thinner gas extend from the star’s poles (top and bottom).
Epsilon Lyrae, the Double Double, is a remarkable
family of four stars, all linked by gravity
▷ NGC 6745
A collision between two galaxies has produced this strangely shaped object, which resembles a bird’s head. The main part of the “head,” seen here in this Hubble Space Telescope image, is a spiral galaxy. It has been highly distorted by its encounter with a smaller elliptical galaxy, which is just visible in the bottom right corner, at the end of the “beak.” The blue-white patches at the top and right of the spiral are areas of star formation triggered by the collision.

LYRA THE LYRE
THIS PROMINENT CONSTELLATION IN THE NORTHERN SKY
CONTAINS THE FIFTH-BRIGHTEST STAR VISIBLE FROM EARTH,
VEGA, ALONG WITH SEVERAL INTERESTING DOUBLE STARS
AND A FAMOUS PLANETARY NEBULA.
The constellation Lyra is said to represent the lyre, or harp, played by the legendary Greek musician Orpheus. However, Arab astronomers visualized it as an eagle or vulture, and the name of its brightest star, Vega, comes from an Arabic phrase meaning “swooping eagle (or vulture).” Near the brilliant Vega lies Epsilon Lyrae, a celebrated quadruple star about 160 light-years away. Telescopes show that each star in this “double” is in fact a close pair—hence its popular name, the Double Double. Another famous double is Beta Lyrae. In this case, the brighter component is also an eclipsing binary (see p.43), which varies between magnitudes 3.3 and 4.4 every 12.9 days. Delta Lyrae is an unrelated pair of red and blue-white stars, of 4th and 6th magnitudes, which is easily divided with binoculars. Zeta Lyrae, another pair of 4th and 6th magnitudes, can be separated with binoculars or small telescopes. Between Beta and Gamma Lyrae lies the Ring Nebula, M57, a beautiful planetary nebula shaped like a smoke ring (see pp.122–23).

▽ Star distances
The closest of the pattern stars that make up Lyra is the also one of the brightest stars in the night sky. Vega is relatively close at 25 light-years, with the rest of the pattern stars all over 100 light-years distant. The most distant of the pattern stars is Eta Lyrae, which is nearly 1,400 light-years from Earth.

THE RING NEBULA
True colors
This Hubble Space Telescope image shows a composite view of the Ring Nebula. It combines images taken through filters, to isolate various elements. The deep blue is very hot helium, the blue-green is the glow of oxygen, and the orange and red indicates nitrogen. Ultraviolet light from the star energizes the gas, making the elements “light up” at different distances from the star due to temperature changes.
Outer shells
The Ring Nebula gets its name from its ringlike appearance. But in 2005 this Spitzer Space Telescope image showed that it is more flowerlike, with outer shells of material beyond the ring. Spitzer recorded infrared light from the shells’ hydrogen molecules, unseen in visible light. This outer material was expelled by the central star during the early stages of its evolution into a planetary nebula.

123
Captured on film
This image shows the Ring Nebula as captured on film in 1973, nearly 200 years after it was discovered. The nebula was discovered in 1779, independently by French astronomers Antoine Darquier de Pellepoix and Charles Messier. The picture was taken using the 13 ft (4 m) telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory, Arizona. Astronomical images were not routinely recorded digitally for another decade.
False-color details
Taken three decades after picture 3 (above), this view of the Ring Nebula was also recorded at Kitt Peak National Observatory, this time using the 111⁄2ft (3.5-meter) telescope. It combines separate images taken through different colored filters. A red one highlights hydrogen and nitrogen, and a green one isolates oxygen. The use of these filters helps bring out greater detail in the nebula’s shells.
3 4 Shape and structure
The nebula’s shape is more complicated than appears at first glance. Its overall shape is similar to that of a barrel, appearing round because the “barrel” is positioned end-on to us (see p.120). Its blue center is in the shape of a football and this protrudes out of opposite sides of an orange-red doughnut ring of material. Dark knots of dense gas are embedded on the inner edge of the rim.
Dying star
Data from telescopes based in space and on the ground combine to give a complete picture of the Ring Nebula. The tiny white dot at the center is a white dwarf, the central remains of the star that blew off the surrounding material thousands of years ago. The nebula’s ring shape is just under one light-year across, and the whole nebula is getting larger, expanding at 43,000 miles (69,000 km) per hour.

▷ Star distances
The constellation of Cygnus is the 16th-largest constellation and spans vast distances in space when the distances to its pattern stars are taken into account. The tail (Deneb) of the Swan is over 1,000 light-years from its beak (Albireo). Sadr, in its chest, is further away still.
CYGNUS THE SWAN
SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS THE NORTHERN CROSS BECAUSE OF
ITS DISTINCTIVE SHAPE, CYGNUS IS PROMINENT IN NORTHERN SKIES.
THE MILKY WAY'S HAZY BAND RUNS THROUGH IT, DIVIDED INTO TWO
STREAMS BY THE CYGNUS RIFT—A DARK LANE OF DUST AND GAS.
Cygnus is an ancient Greek constellation representing a swan. Myths tell how the god Zeus turned himself into a swan to pursue the beautiful Queen Leda of Sparta, and the constellation commemorates his disguise. Deneb, the brightest star in Cygnus, lies in the swan’s tail, while the bird’s long neck extends along the Milky Way to the star Albireo, a true binary star (see pp.40–41) that marks its beak. Other stars suggest the swan’s outstretched wings.
Near Deneb lies a cloud of glowing gas named the North America Nebula, since it looks very much like that continent in shape. Difficult to see with smaller instruments, the nebula shows up best on long-exposure photographs. Between Epsilon Cygni and the border with Vulpecula lies NGC 6992, another nebula best seen on photographs. Known as the Cygnus Loop or Veil Nebula, it is the remains of a star that exploded some 5,000 years ago.

THE CAPTIVE PRINCESS
ANDROMEDA LIES NEXT TO ONE CORNER OF THE

THE NEAREST LARGE GALAXY TO THE MILKY WAY,
A VAST SPIRAL KNOWN AS M31.
Andromeda was a mythical princess, the daughter of Queen Cassiopeia and King Cepheus. In one of the best known Greek myths, the gods ordered Andromeda to be sacrificed to the sea monster Cetus to atone for her mother’s vanity, but she was rescued from the monster’s jaws by the hero Perseus. Andromeda and her rescuer are commemorated in the sky by adjoining constellations. The most important object in this constellation is the Andromeda Galaxy, also known as M31, a huge spiral of stars similar to our own Milky Way but even larger. The Andromeda Galaxy is just visible to the unaided eye on clear, dark nights near the star Nu Andromedae. It is easy to see with binoculars or a small telescope, appearing as an elongated smudge. Lying 2.5 million light-years away, M31 is the most distant object visible to the naked eye.

More than 2,000 years ago this three-sided star pattern was imagined variously as the Greek capital letter Delta, the Nile river delta, and the island of Sicily. A fourth option—an isosceles triangle—prevailed and this is how the constellation is seen today. It is home to the spiral galaxy M33, better known as the Triangulum Galaxy. It is the third-largest member of our Local Group of galaxies and, at 2.7 million light-years away, is one of the closest.

THE LIZARD
A SMALL, OBSCURE CONSTELLATION, LACERTA HAS A ZIGZAG PATTERN THAT
RESEMBLES A SCURRYING LIZARD. IT LIES IN THE NORTHERN PATH OF THE
MILKY WAY, SANDWICHED BETWEEN THE CONSTELLATIONS OF ANDROMEDA
AND CYGNUS. ITS MAIN STARS ARE IN THE REPTILE’S HEAD.
Lacerta was named in 1687 when the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius first described it. It was one of 11 new constellations he devised to fill gaps in the northern sky; seven of these are still in use today. Lacerta’s stars are faint and none have names, but it has been the site of occasional nova explosions. Among the constellation’s dense
Milky Way star clouds are few significant deepsky objects. However, one object of note is BL Lacertae, the prototype of a strange class of galaxy with active nuclei, known as B Lac objects or blazars. These are a type of quasar that emit energetic jets directly toward Earth, giving them the appearance of a star.

PERSEUS
THE VICTORIOUS HERO
PERSEUS IS A PROMINENT CONSTELLATION OF THE NORTHERN SKY. IT LIES
IN THE MILKY WAY BETWEEN ANDROMEDA AND AURIGA, NORTH OF TAURUS
THE BULL. PERSEUS FEATURES A TWIN CLUSTER OF STARS AND A FAMOUS
VARIABLE STAR, ALGOL.
In Greek myth, Perseus was sent to bring back the head of Medusa the Gorgon, whose gaze turned people to stone. He cut off Medusa’s head and was returning home with it when he saw Princess Andromeda chained to a rock as a sacrifice to the sea monster Cetus. Perseus killed Cetus, freed Andromeda, and took her as his bride. The constellations Perseus and Andromeda lie side by side in the night sky.
Perseus is represented holding Medusa’s severed head, marked by the variable star Algol in his left hand. Algol is a binary, in which the fainter star eclipses the brighter one every 2.9 days, causing it to fade for 10 hours. Perseus is the source of the annual Perseid meteor shower, which radiates from the north of the constellation, near the border with Cassiopeia, in mid-August each year.
△ GK Persei
The explosion of Nova Persei threw off a glowing shell of hot gas, resulting in the nova remnant known as GK Persei (also sometimes called the Firework Nebula).
▷ NGC 869 and NGC 884 Known as the Double Cluster, these twin open clusters are visible to the naked eye as a brighter patch in the Milky Way near the border with Cassiopeia. NGC 869 (left in the image) is the brighter and richer of the pair. They lie about 7,000 light-years away.
△ M76
The double-lobed shape of this planetary nebula gives it its popular name: the Little Dumbbell. At 10th magnitude, M76 is the faintest object in Charles Messier’s catalog of deep-sky objects.
In 1901, Nova Persei erupted to become one
of the brightest stars in the sky for several
days before gradually fading away

BRIGHTEST STAR IN THE SKY, CAPELLA.
A SMALL AND FAINT CONSTELLATION IN THE
NORTHEN SKY REPRESENTING A LION CUB,
LEO MINOR WAS INVENTED IN THE LATE
17TH CENTURY BY JOHANNES HEVELIUS.
Auriga represents a charioteer of Greek legend, although the chariot itself is not part of the constellation. Auriga’s brightest star, Capella, represents a goat carried by the charioteer. Another notable star is the white supergiant Epsilon Aurigae, which is an eclipsing binary with an exceptionally long period of 27 years. Three open clusters, M36, M37, and M38, can be seen with binoculars. All lie about 4,000 light-years away. M37 is the largest but M36 is the easiest to spot. The star marking the charioteer’s right foot was once shared with Taurus. When borders for all the constellations were officially decided in 1930, this star was allocated to Taurus, hence its present-day name of Beta Tauri.
Leo Minor is not one of the constellations known to the ancient Greeks but was introduced in 1687 by the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius. Squeezed into a gap between Leo and Ursa Major, it is easily overlooked. It has no star labeled Alpha, although there is a Beta. This is due to an error by the English astronomer Francis Baily, who omitted to label its brightest member, 46 Leonis Minoris, when cataloging its stars in 1845. The constellation’s most famous object is Hanny’s Voorwerp (“Hanny’s Object” in Dutch), an unusual cloud of gas discovered by Dutch amateur astronomer Hanny van Arkel.

The hot, blue star at the left of this image, called AE Aurigae, was ejected from the region of the Orion Nebula about three million years ago. It has now reached this nebula in Auriga. As the star is passing through, it is lighting up the nebula spectacularly, giving rise to its popular name of the Flaming Star Nebula. Eventually, the star will move on and the nebula will darken.

LEO THE LION
LEO IS A LARGE CONSTELLATION OF THE ZODIAC, EASY TO
RECOGNIZE BECAUSE OF ITS RESEMBLANCE TO A CROUCHING
LION. A SICKLE SHAPE FORMED BY SIX STARS OUTLINES THE
HEAD AND CHEST OF THE LION.
Leo is said to represent the lion killed by Hercules, the strong man of Greek myth, as the first of his 12 labors. The Sickle, delineating the lion’s head and chest, looks like a back-to-front question mark. At the base of the Sickle is Leo’s brightest star, Regulus—the heart of the lion. In the middle of the Sickle lies Gamma Leonis, popularly known as Algieba. This binary has two yellow-orange giants that orbit each other every 550 years. A 5th-magnitude star nearby, 40 Leonis, is unrelated. Zeta Leonis, of 3rd magnitude, has two fainter companions visible through binoculars, but the three stars are not gravitationally bound. A number of spiral galaxies can be seen through small telescopes under the lion’s body. Of these galaxies M65, M66, M95, and M96 are the most prominent. Every November, Earth moves through a stream of particles left by the comet Tempel–Tuttle, and the Leonid meteors radiate from the region of the Sickle. Rates are usually low, but storms occasionally occur, as in 1833.

VIRGO THE VIRGIN
VIRGO IS THE LARGEST CONSTELLATION IN THE ZODIAC, AND
ALSO THE SECOND LARGEST IN THE ENTIRE SKY. IT CONTAINS
THE MAJOR CLUSTER OF GALAXIES CLOSEST TO US, AS WELL
AS THE BRIGHTEST QUASAR.
Virgo had several identities in ancient Greek mythology. In one story, she represented Demeter, the corn goddess, and was depicted as holding an ear of grain marked by the constellation’s brightest star, Spica. Usually, though, she was equated with Dike, the goddess of justice, and the adjoining constellation Libra was visualized as her scales of justice. The constellation is shaped like a sloping letter Y, with Spica at the base. In the bowl of the Y is situated the Virgo Cluster, some 55 million light-years away. This cluster of galaxies has more than 2,000 members, the brightest of which can be seen through a small telescope. So large is the cluster that it spills over Virgo’s northern border into the adjacent constellation of Coma Berenices. At the heart of the Virgo Cluster is the giant elliptical galaxy M87. The brightest quasar (see pp.60–61) as seen from Earth, 3C 273, also lies in Virgo but is over 50 times farther away than the Virgo Cluster.

COMA BERENICES
BERENICE’S HAIR
NAMED AFTER THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN QUEEN BERENICES II,
COMA BERENICES IS EASILY LOCATED BETWEEN THE MORE
PROMINENT CONSTELLATIONS OF LEO AND BOÖTES. IT
CONTAINS CLUSTERS OF BOTH STARS AND GALAXIES.
Considered part of Leo until 1536, Coma Berenices was first shown as a separate constellation on a globe by German cartographer Caspar Vopel. The constellation has no stars brighter than 4th magnitude, but plenty of interesting deep-sky objects. Galaxies such as M85, M88, M99, and M100 near the southern border with Virgo are part of the Virgo Cluster about 50 million light-years away. Others belong to the Coma Cluster, which is six times more distant. Melotte 111 is one of the closest open star clusters: more than 20 of its stars are visible to the naked eye.
THE CONSTELLATIONS
M98 A spiral galaxy seen nearly edge-on, 44 million light-years away. Part of the Virgo Cluster and discovered in 1791 on the same day as M99 and M100
M85 A lenticular galaxy about 125,000 light-years wide and 60 million light-years from Earth
NGC 4565 A spiral galaxy seen edge on. Commonly called the Needle Galaxy because of its long, thin appearance
FS Comae Berenices A red giant that is also a semiregular variable. It changes in brightness between magnitude 5.3 and 6.1 in a 58-day cycle
△ M64
The brightest galaxy in Coma Berenices, M64 is nicknamed the Black Eye Galaxy because of the lane of dark dust near its bright core. It lies 17 million light-years from Earth.

THE SCALES
OCCUPYING AN AREA OF SKY ONCE SEEN AS PART OF
SCORPIUS, LIBRA REPRESENTS THE SCALES OF JUSTICE.
IT IS THE LEAST CONSPICUOUS ZODIAC CONSTELLATION
AND THE ONLY ONE TO DEPICT AN INANIMATE OBJECT.
The ancient Greeks called this part of the sky Chelae Scorpionis, the scorpion’s claws, but by the 5th century BCE, the Romans were describing it as a balance. Today, Libra is characterized as the scales of justice held aloft by neighboring Virgo. The names of its brightest stars reflect Libra’s past: Zubenelgenubi is Arabic for southern claw, and Zubeneschamali, northern claw. Lying just south of the celestial equator, the faint constellation of Libra is best found by locating its brighter neighbors. Libra’s variable star Delta changes between the 5th and 6th magnitudes in a 2-day, 8-hour cycle, and Iota is a multiple star.

The nearest of Scorpius’s main pattern stars is Epsilon (ε) Scorpii, at 64 light-years away. The most distant is Zeta1 ( ζ1) Scorpii, at about 2,570 light-years from Earth. (The other member of the double star Zeta Scorpii, Zeta2, is only about 130 light-years away.) Many of the stars in Scorpius are members of the Scorpius–Centaurus Association (a group of young stars formed at about the same time) and are at similar distances from Earth: about 500 light-years away.

Scorpius represents the scorpion that stung Orion the Hunter to death. Myth tells how the adversaries were placed on opposite sides of the sky so that as the scorpion rises, Orion sets. The constellation was once also called Scorpio, but astronomers no longer use this name. Scorpius’s brightest star, the red supergiant Antares, marks the scorpion’s heart. An arc of stars leading south from Antares gives the impression of
a scorpion’s tail. At the tail’s end is the constellation’s second-brightest star, Shaula (from the Arabic for “stinger”). The tail, situated in a dense area toward the Milky Way’s center, is dotted with star clusters. Many of the brightest stars in Scorpius and its adjoining constellations lie about 500 light-years away. They are all members of an area of recent star formation called the Scorpius–Centaurus Association. Antares is its brightest member.

THE SERPENT
UNIQUELY AMONG THE CONSTELLATIONS, SERPENS
IS DIVIDED IN TWO, WITH ITS HEAD ON ONE SIDE
OF OPHIUCHUS AND ITS TAIL ON THE OTHER. THE
TWO PARTS COUNT AS A SINGLE CONSTELLATION.
Serpens represents a snake or serpent held by Ophiuchus, who grasps its head in his left hand and its tail in his right. The head section of the constellation is known as Serpens Caput, while the tail is Serpens Cauda. The constellation’s brightest star is 3rd-magnitude Alpha Serpentis. Its popular name, Unukalhai, is from the Arabic for “serpent’s neck,” which is where it lies. In the serpent’s head is Beta Serpentis, which has a 7th-magnitude unrelated companion visible with binoculars. In the serpent’s tail is M16, a star cluster surrounded by the Eagle Nebula, made famous by the “pillars of creation” Hubble image. Also in the tail, Alya (Theta Serpentis) is a 5th-magnitude double divisible through a small telescope. Nearby is IC 4765, an open cluster visible through binoculars.
THE CONSTELLATIONS

THE SERPENT HOLDER
OPHIUCHUS IS A LARGE CONSTELLATION THAT

AND SAGITTARIUS IN THE SOUTH.
Ophiuchus represents a legendary healer called Aesculapius, who was reputed to be able to revive the dead. In the sky, he is depicted holding a snake (a traditional symbol of healing) in the form of the constellation Serpens. Although large, the constellation is not particularly prominent. Its brightest star is second-magnitude Rasalhague (Alpha Ophiuchi), which marks Ophiuchus’s head. Its most celebrated star is Barnard’s Star, a faint (10th-magnitude) red dwarf a mere 5.9 light-years away. Ophiuchus contains numerous globular clusters, of which M10 and M12 are the easiest to see through a small telescope. The Sun passes through Ophiuchus in the first half of December each year but it is not regarded by many as a traditional constellation of the zodiac (see pp.92–93).

AQUILA THE EAGLE
THE PATTERN MADE BY THE STARS IN AQUILA CAN
EASILY BE IMAGINED AS AN EAGLE SOARING IN
THE SKY. AQUILA IS A SPECIAL EAGLE ASSOCIATED
WITH THE GREEK GOD ZEUS.
One of the original 48 constellations, Aquila straddles the celestial equator in a rich region of the Milky Way. Aquila could be the eagle that carried Zeus’s thunderbolts, or alternatively, it could be Zeus in the form of an eagle, which enabled him to carry Ganymede to Mount Olympus to serve the gods. The eagle appears to swoop down toward adjacent Aquarius, which is identified with Ganymede. Aquila can best be found by spotting its brightest star, Altair (Alpha Aquilae), whose name is Arabic for flying eagle. It is the 12th-brightest star in the entire night sky and at only 17 light-years away, also one of the closest bright stars. With Deneb (in Cygnus) and Vega (in Lyra) it forms the Summer Triangle of northern skies. The supergiant Eta Aquilae is one of the brightest naked-eye Cepheid variables. Its magnitude changes from 3.5 to 4.4 in a 7.2 day cycle.
THE CONSTELLATIONS
Tarazed (γ Aquilae) Aquila’s second brightest star. An orange giant, which with Alshain flanks Altair to form a row of three bright stars
Altair (α Aquilae)
A main-sequence star almost twice the size of the Sun. It also has a higher temperature, which makes Altair appear white in color
Alshain (β Aquilae) A yellow subgiant about three and a half times the size of the Sun. Preparing to become a more luminous giant

SCUTUM THE SHIELD
THE FIFTH-SMALLEST CONSTELLATION IN THE
SKY, SCUTUM LIES IN A BRIGHT AREA OF THE
MILKY WAY BETWEEN SAGITTARIUS AND THE
PROMINENT STAR ALTAIR IN AQUILA.
The constellation Scutum was defined by the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius in 1684. He devised it in honour of his patron, King John III Sobiesci of Poland; its original name being Scutum Sobiescianum – Sobiesci’s Shield. Just south of the celestial equator, its brightest stars are only fourth magnitude, none are named, and two, Delta and R Scuti are interesting variables. It is, however, crossed by a bright, star-rich region of the Milky Way. This includes the Scutum Star Cloud, the brightest part of the Milky Way outside Sagittarius. The Star Cloud is home to the Wild Duck Cluster, which contains around 3,000 stars. Scutum’s brightest star is Alpha Scuti, 132 times more luminous than the Sun.
SCUTUM
Beta (β) Scuti A yellow giant of magnitude 4.2. It is 690 light-years away, 64 times the size of the Sun, and 1,760 times its luminosity
NGC 6709 A loose cluster of about 60 young stars. At magnitude 6.7, this cluster is just beyond visibility by the naked eye
Zeta (ζ) Aquilae A white main-sequence star marking the eagle’s tail. It is about twice the size and mass of the Sun and 40 times its luminosity
M26
A tight, open star cluster of magnitude 8.9. About 5,000 light-years away, its stars are 90 million years old
R Scuti
This orange supergiant is a pulsating variable. It changes in magnitude from 4.5 to 8.8, in a cycle lasting 144 days
Alpha (α) Scuti The brightest star in Scutum, of magnitude 3.8. This orange giant is about 21 times the width of the Sun

A FAINT NORTHERN CONSTELLATION NEAR THE HEAD OF CYGNUS, THE SWAN,
VULPECULA WAS INTRODUCED AT THE END OF THE 17TH CENTURY BY THE
POLISH ASTRONOMER JOHANNES HEVELIUS. IT CONTAINS A FAMOUS
PLANETARY NEBULA, THE DUMBBELL.
Johannes Hevelius originally called this constellation Vulpecula cum Ansere, the fox and goose, but modern astronomers have simplified the name to just Vulpecula. It consists of a scattering of stars of 4th magnitude and fainter in the Milky Way south of Cygnus. On its southern border with Sagitta lies a grouping called Brocchi’s Cluster. Through binoculars, this group appears as a line of six stars with a protruding hook, reminiscent of a coat hanger, which gives rise to its popular name, the Coathanger. However, it is not a true cluster, because all its stars are at different distances from us. Another celebrated object in Vulpecula is M27, a planetary nebula popularly known as the Dumbbell from its supposed resemblance to a barbell used for weight training.

BETWEEN PEGASUS AND AQUILA.
Sagitta is one of the original 48 constellations known to the ancient Greeks. Its four brightest stars, all of 4th magnitude, suggest the shape of an arrow. The main object of interest for users of binoculars or small telescopes is M71. It was long considered to be a rich open cluster but is now classified as a globular cluster, even though it lacks the dense central concentration typical of most globulars. Other notable objects include WZ Sagittae, a dwarf nova star system that undergoes periodic outbursts of energy, and the Necklace Nebula, a planetary nebula with a ring of bright “knots” that resembles a necklace.
It is easy to visualize a leaping dolphin among the stars of Delphinus. In Greek mythology, dolphins were the messengers of Poseidon, the sea god. Alpha and Beta Delphini, the constellation’s brightest stars, bear the odd names Sualocin and Rotanev. In reverse, they spell Nicolaus Venator, the Latinized form of Niccolò Cacciatore, an Italian astronomer who seemingly named the stars after himself in the early 19th century. Among other objects of interest are Gamma Delphini, a wide double star easily divided with binoculars, the faint globular cluster NGC 6934, and a pair of colliding galaxies known as ZW II 96.
▷ M71
This Hubble Space Telescope image shows a brilliant splash of stars in the heart of the globular cluster M71 in Sagitta. M71 lies roughly 13,000 light-years away and is about 27 light-years in diameter.

THE WATER CARRIER
THIS CONSTELLATION DEPICTS A YOUNG
MAN POURING WATER FROM A JAR. IT
CONTAINS TWO FAMOUS PLANETARY
NEBULAE: HELIX AND SATURN.
Aquarius represents a young shepherd boy called Ganymede, who in Greek mythology was taken up to the heavens by Zeus to serve as a waiter to the gods on Mount Olympus. In the sky, he is visualized as pouring water out of a jar. The water jar is marked by a Y-shaped group of four stars in the north of the constellation—Gamma, Pi, Zeta, and Eta Aquarii. The flow of water from the jar is suggested by a stream of stars cascading southward to the constellation’s border with Piscis Austrinus, the Southern Fish. The Eta Aquarid meteor shower—caused by dust from Halley’s Comet entering the atmosphere as Earth crosses the comet’s path—radiates from the area of the Water Jar asterism in early May each year. At the peak of the shower, as many as 35 meteors can be seen per hour.
Zeta (ζ) Aquarii
In the centre of the Water Jar asterism is the binary star Zeta Aquarii, which can be divided through small telescopes. Its two 4th-magnitude white stars orbit each other every 490 years

△ The First Point of Aries
Pisces contains the vernal (spring) equinox, also known as the First Point of Aries. This is the point at which the Sun crosses the celestial equator from south to north in March each year and is the point from which right ascension is measured. Originally in the constellation Aries, the vernal equinox has shifted position over time because of precession, the slow wobble of the Earth on its axis.
▷ Star distances
The nearest and farthest of Pisces’ main pattern stars both form part of the Circlet: Iota (ι) Piscium at 45 light-years away, and TX Piscium, which is 20 times farther away, at about 900 light-years from Earth. These two stars are also the least and most luminous of Pisces’ pattern stars, with Iota emitting about four times as much energy as the Sun gives off and TX Piscium about 690 times as much.

PISCES THE FISH
ONE OF THE 48 CONSTELLATIONS OF CLASSICAL
TIMES, PISCES IS A ZODIAC CONSTELLATION THAT
REPRESENTS TWO FISH. ITS MOST DISTINCTIVE
FEATURE IS A RING OF STARS CALLED THE CIRCLET.
A faint constellation lodged between Aquarius and Aries, Pisces can be found by looking south of the Great Square of Pegasus and locating a ring of stars. Named the Circlet, this ring marks the body of a fish. Pisces’ second fish faces the opposite direction but the two are tied together by “ribbons.” The star Alrescha marks the knot joining the two ribbons. According to Greek myth, the fish are linked to the goddess Aphrodite and her son Eros. Pisces is probably best known for containing the point where the Sun crosses the celestial equator into the northern hemisphere. Called the First Point of Aries, or vernal (spring) equinox, this point is used to measure celestial coordinates (see pp.90–91).

TAURUS THE BULL
THIS PROMINENT CONSTELLATION IS PART OF THE ZODIAC
AND ORIGINALLY RECOGNIZED BY THE ANCIENT BABYLONIANS
OVER 2,500 YEARS AGO. IT CONTAINS TWO CELEBRATED OPEN
STAR CLUSTERS AND A FAMOUS SUPERNOVA REMNANT.
Taurus represents the head and front parts of a bull looking directly at adjacent Orion. According to Greek legend, this beast is Zeus disguised to seduce the maiden Europa. Its V-shaped face is marked by the nearest major star cluster to us, the Hyades, which contains about 200 stars centered on Theta Tauri and spread over a large area of sky. A more tightly bunched cluster, the Pleiades, marks the bull’s shoulder. Taurus’s brightest star, Aldebaran, forms one of the bull’s eyes. The stars Theta, Kappa, and Sigma Tauri are all doubles. Lambda Tauri is an eclipsing binary, and T Tauri, a variable.
THE CONSTELLATIONS
The Pleiades (M45)
Six of this cluster’s stars are visible to the naked eye, including Alcyone, the brightest in the cluster; many more stars can be seen with binoculars
Elnath (β Tauri) Just over 4 times the size of the Sun and 700 times its luminosity, Elnath is Taurus’s second-brightest star
Zeta (ζ) Tauri
A binary star of magnitude 3.0. The stars are so close they cannot be separated by most telescopes
Aldebaran (α Tauri) This giant’s red color can be seen by the naked eye. At magnitude 0.9, it is the night sky’s 14th-brightest star
Theta (θ Tauri)
A binary star and the centrer of the Hyades cluster, which extends out as far as Aldebaran and Gamma Tauri

△ M1
Popularly called the Crab Nebula, this is the remnant of a supernova that exploded in 1054 and was bright enough to be seen in the daytime. It is about 10 light-years across and still expanding as filaments of gas rush outward from the site of the explosion. A neutron star, the central remnant of the original star is in its center.
◁ NGC 695
This spiral galaxy, about 450 million light-years away, lies face-on to us. Its spiral arms are not well defined and very loosely wound. Knots of star formation are tangled in a mesh of dust and gas, which gives the whole galaxy a peculiar appearance.

ARIES THE RAM
ONE OF THE ZODIAC CONSTELLATIONS, ARIES
REPRESENTS A CROUCHING RAM WITH ITS
HEAD TURNED TOWARD TAURUS. ITS PATTERN
IS RELATIVELY FAINT AND HARD TO IDENTIFY.
According to Greek legend, Aries is the ram whose golden fleece was sought by Jason and the Argonauts. Its most prominent part is a bent line made from three bright stars that mark the ram’s head. More than 2,000 years ago Aries contained the vernal equinox, the point where the Sun crosses the celestial equator, south to north. The point, also known as the “First Point of Aries,” defines zero hours right ascension. Today, it is in neighboring Pisces.

Hamal (α Arietis) About 90 times brighter than the Sun, this bright star is 66 light-years away. Its name is Arabic for lamb
Mesartim (γ Arietis) At magnitude 3.9, this binary star is easily visible to the naked eye. A small telescope separates it into a pair of almost identical white stars
Sheratan (β Arietis) The two stars in this binary are so close they cannot be separated by a conventional telescope. The primary star is a blue-white main-sequence star

Eridanus represents the mythical river that Phaethon, the son of the Sun-god Helios, fell into while attempting to drive his father’s Sun-chariot across the sky. Ancient Greek astronomers traced the celestial river as far south as the star we know as Acamar (Theta Eridani). Eridanus was later extended farther south so that it now ends at the star we call Achernar (Alpha Eridani). The names Acamar and Achernar both come from

When Betelgeuse explodes,

Star distances
At just under 500 light-years away, Betelgeuse is the closer of Orion’s two brightest stars. Rigel is much more distant—about 860 light-years away—but most of the time, Rigel looks brighter than Betelgeuse because it emits far more light. The three stars that form the line of Orion’s Belt are widely spread out in space, with Alnilam being the most distant. In fact, Alnilam is the farthest of all Orion’s main pattern stars, at nearly 2,000 light-years away. The nearest pattern star is Pi3 Orionis, which is only 26 light-years from Earth

The Trapezium
The stars forming in the Orion Nebula include a group called the Trapezium. As well as the four stars seen here, the system includes two fainter members.
M42
Better known as the Orion Nebula, this star-forming region is about 24 lightyears across. It is shown here as bright pink because radiation from hot young stars causes hydrogen gas to glow pink. The nebula is embedded in a much larger dark cloud; dust in this cloud is coloured dull pink.
Betelgeuse
The supergiant star Betelgeuse is more than 500 times bigger than the Sun. If it was placed at the center of our Solar System, it would engulf the Sun and all the planets out as far as Jupiter. Betelgeuse is both relatively young and highly unstable, varying erratically in brightness. At some point in the next million years, it will probably explode in a supernova.

ORION THE HUNTER
FORMED FROM AN EASILY RECOGNIZABLE PATTERN OF
STARS, ORION IS FAMILIAR TO MOST SKYWATCHERS. IT
CONTAINS SEVERAL BRIGHT STARS AND THE ORION NEBULA,
ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SIGHTS IN THE NIGHT SKY.
Orion is an ancient constellation that represents a hunter or warrior in Greek myth. Orion was the son of Poseidon, the god of the sea, and was a hunter of great prowess. Despite his hunting skill, he was killed by a mere scorpion, possibly in retribution for his boastfulness. In the sky, the scorpion is depicted by the constellation Scorpius, and as Orion sets below the horizon, Scorpius rises and pursues him across the sky. Close to Orion’s heels are Canis Major and Canis Minor, representing his hunting dogs. The two brightest stars in Orion provide a striking colour contrast: the red supergiant Betelgeuse marks the hunter’s shoulder, while the blue supergiant Rigel is positioned in one of this feet. Many of the constellation’s highlights are near the line of stars that represents Orion’s Belt. The belt is easy to find because it is made up of three equally spaced bright stars—Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka—which form an almost perfectly straight line. Just below the belt is a complex of stars and nebulae that represent the hunter’s sword. This area includes a vast area of star formation called the Orion Nebula (M42), the largest and closest nebula of its kind in the night sky. Other nebulae lie nearby, including the Horsehead Nebula, a dark nebula silhoutted against the bright emission nebula, known as IC 434.

VIEWS OF THE ORION NEBULA
1 Orion's sword
The Orion Nebula is one of the most observed and photographed objects in the night sky. To the naked eye it is a just a fuzzy patch marking the sword of Orion. However, photographs transform it into a colorful maelstrom of star-birth. This wide-field view shows all of the massive star-formation region. It was taken by the VISTA infrared telescope at the European Paranal Observatory in Chile.
2 Heart of the nebula
The heart of the Orion Nebula stellary nursery contains thousands of young stars and developing protostars. The infant stars have blown away much of the dust and gas in which they formed, carving a huge cavity in the cloud, seen here in red. The brilliant starlight of the region at the top of the cavity comes from a tight open cluster of young stars, known as the Trapezium (see p.162).
3 Infrared composite
This infrared view combines data from two space telescopes, Spitzer and Herschel. It shows a region of the nebula about 10 light-years across, with the Trapezium to the left of the image. In infrared light, it is dust rather than the gas and stars that shines brightest. The red regions show cold dust, condensed into clumps around stars in the process of forming. Blue indicates warmer dust, heated by fully formed hot, young stars.
4 High-temperature gas
A high-temperature gas cloud, shown here in blue, is revealed when the nebula is imaged in X-ray light by the space telescope XMMNewton. It appears to fill the nebula's huge cavity, which is visible in optical and infrared views. The cloud was produced in a violent collision when wind from a massive star was heated to millions of degrees as it slammed into surrounding gas. The bright yellow patch is the Trapezium cluster.

△ Castor multi-star system
Through a small telescope, Castor appears as a double star, Castor A and B, with components that orbit one another every 460 years. Each of these stars is itself a binary. To complicate the picture further, Castor A and B also have a faint red dwarf companion, known as Castor C, which is an eclipsing binary, completing a remarkable system of six stars all linked by gravity.
▽ M35
This large cluster of about 200 stars is easily visible through binoculars near the border where Gemini meets Taurus. Telescopes also show the fainter and more tightly bunched cluster NGC 2158, seen at bottom left of this image. M35 is approximately 2,800 light-years away, while NGC 2158 is around 10,000 light-years more distant.
△ NGC 2392
This unusual-looking planetary nebula gets its popular name from its resemblance to a face surrounded by a furry parka hood. The “hood” is really a ring of gas streaming away from the central star, creating the appearance of a disk when seen through a small telescope. The Eskimo Nebula is about 5,000 light-years away.

GEMINI THE TWINS
GEMINI IS A PROMINENT CONSTELLATION OF THE ZODIAC, REPRESENTING THE
MYTHOLOGICAL TWINS CASTOR AND POLLUX. ITS TWO BRIGHTEST STARS MARK
THE HEADS OF THE TWINS. ITEMS OF INTEREST INCLUDE A BRIGHT STAR CLUSTER
AND AN UNUSUAL-LOOKING PLANETARY NEBULA.
In Greek mythology, Castor and Pollux were the sons of Queen Leda of Sparta. Pollux was said to have been fathered by the god Zeus and was immortal, while Castor’s father was Leda’s husband, King Tyndareus, and he was mortal. The twins joined the crew of the Argo and went in search of the Golden Fleece, in one of the great epics of ancient Greek mythology. Overall, Gemini is rectangular in shape. One of its two main stars, Castor, is a remarkable multi-star system (see diagram, below right), the two brightest
members of which can be seen separately through a small telescope. Although Castor is labeled Alpha Geminorum, it is not the brightest star in Gemini, which is Pollux (Beta Geminorum), the constellation’s other main star. One of the year’s richest meteor showers, the Geminids, appears to radiate from a point near Castor around December 13 each year. Up to 100 meteors an hour can be seen. Unlike most meteor showers, the parent body is not a comet but an asteroid, Phaethon.

Although Castor and Pollux are twins in mythology, the stars themselves are not related. Castor (α Geminorum) is about 51 light-years away, whereas Pollux (β Geminorum) is 34 lightyears away. Both stars are relatively close to us on the distance scale of the Galaxy. They are also considerably closer than the farthest of Gemini’s pattern stars: Zeta (ζ) Geminorum, which is about 1,375 light-years from Earth.

CANCER
THE CRAB
ALTHOUGH THE FAINTEST OF THE
ZODIAC CONSTELLATIONS, CANCER IS
EASY TO FIND BETWEEN THE BRIGHTER
STARS OF LEO AND GEMINI.
Cancer represents the crab that attacked the hero Hercules as he fought the multi-headed monster Hydra. A square of stars form the body of the “crab,” and the stars Alpha and Iota mark its claws. Alpha takes its name Acubens from the Arabic for claw. The names of the stars Assellus Borealis and Assellus Australis, the northern and southern ass, come from a different legend featuring a donkey. These stars lie on either side of the cluster M44 (also known as the Beehive Cluster), which is said to represent the donkey’s manger. None of Cancer's stars is particularly bright, and the region is relatively barren. Iota is a yellow giant with a companion detectable with binoculars, and Acubens and Zeta are multiple stars.
THE CONSTELLATIONS
Assellus Borealis (γ Cancri) A white subgiant a little over twice the Sun’s mass and width, and 35 times its luminosity
Assellus Australis (δ Cancri) An orange giant of magnitude 3.9, it is 11 times the Sun’s width and more than 50 times as luminous
Acubens (α Cancri)
Two white main-sequence stars with two red dwarf stars close by, but seen as a single star by the naked eye

The open star cluster M67 is about 5 billion years old, making it one of the oldest open clusters known. It consists of more than 100 stars with the same chemical composition as the Sun and red giants. Smaller, denser, and 2,600 light-years away, it is more distant than M44 (the Beehive Cluster) but also covers the width of a Full Moon. It can be seen using binoculars.
△ The Winter Triangle
Procyon (upper left) marks one of the corners of this obvious triangle of the northern winter sky. The two other corners are formed by the brilliant stars Sirius in Canis Major (bottom center) and the red giant Betelgeuse in Orion (upper right).

CANIS MINOR
THE LITTLE DOG
ONE OF THE ORIGINAL CONSTELLATIONS DESCRIBED
BY THE ASTRONOMERS OF ANCIENT GREECE, CANIS
MINOR IS SMALL BUT EASILY SPOTTED BECAUSE OF
ITS BRILLIANT STAR PROCYON.
Canis Minor is the smaller of Orion’s two hunting dogs. The little dog is drawn around the constellation’s brightest stars Procyon and Gomeisa. Located almost on the celestial equator, the constellation has little of interest other than Procyon, the eighth brightest star in the night sky. Meaning “before the dog” in Greek, the star is so-named because in Mediterranean latitudes it rises shortly before the more brilliant Dog Star, Sirius (in Canis Major). Procyon and Sirius are about the same distance from Earth and their differing brightness therefore indicates a true difference in their luminosity. Procyon, like Sirius, is a binary with a white dwarf companion, Procyon B, visible with a very large telescope. Procyon also marks one corner of the Winter Triangle.
CANIS MINOR
Gomeisa (β Canis Minoris) A blue-white main-sequence star that is 195 times more luminous than the Sun

THE UNICORN
A LARGE BUT NOT PROMINENT CONSTELLATION, MONOCEROS
HAS NO BRIGHT INDIVIDUAL STARS. HOWEVER, IT DOES
CONTAIN MANY NOTABLE MULTIPLE STARS AND DEEP-SKY
OBJECTS, SUCH AS STAR CLUSTERS AND NEBULAE.
Monoceros is situated between Hydra and Orion, with Canis Major to the south and Canis Minor to the north. Beta Monocerotis is one of the finest triples in the sky. Its three 5th-magnitude stars can be separated with small telescopes. Delta Monocerotis is a wide, unrelated pair of stars, visible with binoculars. Epsilon Monocerotis, of 4th magnitude, has a fainter, unrelated companion visible through small telescopes. Lying in the band of the Milky Way, Monoceros has many star clusters and nebulae. Among the features visible with binoculars are the open cluster M50 in the south of the constellation, and NGC 2264 in the north. Long-exposure images show a faint nebulosity around NGC 2264, including a dark dust lane, the Cone Nebula. Another notable deep-sky object is the Rosette Nebula, surrounding the elongated star cluster NGC 2244.
NGC 2244 At the core of the Rosette Nebula, about 5,500 lightyears away, is this elongated star cluster, which is visible through binoculars. The Rosette Nebula itself (NGC 2237) is three to four times larger than NGC 2244
M50
An open cluster visible through binoculars, M50 lies about 3,000 lightyears away. A telescope is needed to resolve its individual stars, which are of 8th magnitude and fainter
NGC 2232
Visible through binoculars, this scattered cluster is about 1,300 light-years from Earth. Its brightest member is the 5th-magnitude star 10 Monocerotis
NGC 2264
This open cluster, about 2,500 light-years away, can be observed with binoculars. Through a small telescope it looks triangular in shape. Its brightest member is the 5th-magnitude star S Monocerotis
Delta (δ) Monocerotis This 4th-magnitude star has an unrelated companion, called 21 Monocerotis. The companion star is closer to us than Delta Monocerotis and is visible with binoculars or even sharp eyesight

Although the monster confronted by Hercules in the ancient Greek myths had nine heads, Hydra is depicted in the sky with just a single head. The stars depicting the head are in the northern celestial hemisphere, to the south of Cancer, while most of the body and tail are in the southern celestial hemisphere. The constellation’s brightest star, Alphard, marks the monster’s heart. It sits in an otherwise empty looking patch of sky and derives its common name from the Arabic for “the solitary one.” The two main objects to look out for in Hydra are the spiral galaxy M83 and the planetary nebula NGC 3242.

SEXTANS THE SEXTANT
CORVUS THE CROW
THIS FAINT CONSTELLATION LIES
DIRECTLY ON THE CELESTIAL EQUATOR.
IT CAN BE FOUND CLOSE TO THE STAR
REGULUS IN LEO.
THIS CONSTELLATION’S SHAPE IS
DEFINED BY ITS FOUR BRIGHTEST
STARS, WHICH FORM THE BODY
OF THE CROW.
Just three stars define the Sextant, a constellation identified by the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius in 1687. It represents an instrument used on board ship for position-finding. Sextans’ stars are relatively dim, its brightest being only magnitude 4.5, and none are named. Its galaxies are best viewed through large telescopes. NGC 3115, called the Spindle Galaxy because it appears spindle-shaped in the sky, is magnitude 8.5 and just visible through binoculars in good conditions. Two unrelated stars of 6th magnitude, 17 and 18 Sextantis are close by and also only visible through binoculars.
Corvus is the sacred bird of the Greek god Apollo. Its story is linked with that of neighboring Crater (the cup) and Hydra (the water snake). Dispatched by Apollo to collect water in a cup, the crow returned with neither but with a water snake instead. The constellation is best found by looking southwest of the star Spica in Virgo. One corner of Corvus’s rectangle shape is marked by Delta Corvi. This double star consists of a bright 3rd-magnitude blue star orbited by a dimmer star. Corvus contains the Antennae Galaxies, one of the nearest and youngest pairs of colliding galaxies.
THE CONSTELLATIONS
△ NGC 3115
This huge lenticular galaxy is seen edge-on from Earth. Its central bulge of stars is clearly visible. A supermassive black hole is hidden from view, deep inside. Also known as the Spindle Galaxy, the galaxy is about 30 million light-years away. It is not to be confused with the Spindle Galaxy in Draco.
△ NGC 4038 and NGC 4039
The faint tails of stars, gas, and dust that extend from NGC 4038 and NGC 4039 give the galaxies their popular name of the Antennae. The tails formed when the galaxies started to interact a few hundred million years ago. The galaxies’ collision led to the creation of huge star-forming regions surrounded by glowing hydrogen gas.
Alpha (α) Sextantis This blue-white giant, 287 light-years from Earth, is found just south of the celestial equator

CRATER THE CUP
REPRESENTING THE DRINKING CUP OF THE GREEK GOD APOLLO, CRATER IS
USUALLY DEPICTED AS A DOUBLE-HANDLED CHALICE. FAINT AND INDISTINCT,
THIS CONSTELLATION MAY BE MORE EASILY LOCATED IF IMAGINED AS A
LARGE BOW TIE IN THE SKY.
One of the original 48 constellations from Greek mythology, Crater’s story links it with its neighboring constellations Corvus (the crow) and Hydra (the water snake). Apollo is said to have placed the three together in the sky. He was angered that the crow not only was slow to return from a water-collecting trip, but then lied that the water snake had prevented him from collecting any water.
Crater has no brilliant stars, the brightest being Delta, at magnitude 3.6. A large telescope is needed to see any deep-sky objects, such as the barred spiral galaxy NGC 3981. This and galaxies NGC 3511 and NGC 3887 were discovered by British astronomer William Hershel in the mid-1780s. Much more distant, about 6 billion light-years from Earth, is the quasar RXJ 1131.
CRATER
△ RXJ 1131
The four pink dots in this image are the quasar RXJ 1131. The multiple images are the result of the quasar’s light being bent by an elliptical galaxy. That galaxy, seen in the center, is on the same line of sight as RXJ 1131 but is much closer to us.

Centaurus is one of the 48 constellations known to the ancient Greeks. It represents Chiron, a wise centaur who taught the gods and mythical heroes of ancient Greece in his cave on Mount Pelion. Rigil Kentaurus (Alpha Centauri) appears to the naked eye as the third-brightest star in the sky, outshone only by Sirius and Canopus. A telescope splits it into a pair of golden-yellow stars that form a true binary, orbiting each other every 80 years. It is the closest star to the Sun visible to the naked eye. But there is also a third member of the system, only visible with a telescope—a red dwarf called Proxima Centauri, over one-tenth of a light-year closer to the Sun than the other two, making it the closest star of all. In the heart of the constellation lies NGC 5139 (Omega Centauri), a globular cluster so bright that it was at first catalogued as a star. NGC 5128 (Centaurus A) to its north is thought to be the result of a merger between an elliptical and a spiral galaxy.

CRUX
THE SOUTHERN CROSS
ALTHOUGH IT IS THE SMALLEST CONSTELLATION OF ALL, CRUX IS ONE OF THE
MOST DISTINCTIVE DUE TO ITS FOUR BRIGHT STARS. CROSSED BY THE MILKY
WAY’S STAR-RICH PATH, IT HOSTS ONE OF THE GEMS OF THE SOUTHERN NIGHT
SKY: THE JEWEL BOX CLUSTER.
Situated between the legs of Centaurus, Crux is the sky’s most compact grouping of four bright stars. Its brilliant stars were known to the ancient Greeks but only mapped as a separate constellation in the 16th century. Crux first appeared in its modern form on the celestial globe of cartographer Petrus Plancius in 1598. Initially called Crux Australis, the Southern Cross, it is now known simply as Crux. The southern end of its cross-shaped pattern is marked by the constellation’s brightest star, Acrux. It, Mimosa,
and Gacrux are in the top 25 brightest night-time stars. More distant than Crux’s four main stars, at about 600 light-years away, is a wedge-shaped dark patch of sky named the Coalsack. This dark nebula of gas and dust is visible to the naked eye because it blocks out light from the dense Milky Way star fields behind it. Just north and about ten times more distant than the Coalsack is the Jewel Box Cluster (NGC 4755). This appears as a fuzzy star to the naked eye but binoculars reveal individual stars.
THE CONSTELLATIONS
▷ Locating the South Celestial Pole Crux has been used for centuries as a pointer to the South Celestial Pole. Its bright stars and the two brightest in Centaurus (Hadar and Alpha Centauri) are easy to spot, as can be seen in the photograph above. Extend southward a line connecting Gacrux and Acrux, and an imaginary line bisecting Alpha Centauri and Hadar. The two cross just east of the South Pole, the nearest star to which is Sigma Octantis in Octans.

Popularly known as the Jewel Box Cluster because of its resemblance to a casket of sparkling jewels, this open star cluster contains several dozen blue-white giants and has a ruby-red supergiant close to its center. The cluster is about 20 light-years wide and 6,400 light-years from Earth. At about 15 million years old, it is one of the youngest clusters known.

LUPUS
THE WOLF
THIS CONSTELLATION LIES ON THE EDGE OF THE
MILKY WAY, BETWEEN SCORPIUS AND CENTAURUS.
THE PATTERN OF THE WOLF IS DIFFICULT TO
RECOGNIZE, BUT IT CONTAINS STARS OF INTEREST.
Lupus was first outlined as an unspecified wild animal impaled on a pole carried by Centaurus, but is drawn as a separate wolf in modern times. Its two brightest stars, Alpha and Beta, mark its hind legs, and the globular cluster NGC 5986 marks its head. Stargazers might find a wolf easier to picture if Alpha is imagined in its mouth, and Beta in the back of its neck. Small telescopes reveal that stars Kappa and Mu are double stars, and a larger telescope shows that Mu is really a triple star.

THE SET SQUARE
THIS IS A SMALL CONSTELLATION THAT WAS ONLY
CREATED IN THE EARLY 1750s, AND LATER REDUCED
IN SIZE. IT LIES ON THE PATH OF THE MILKY WAY
AND IS RICH IN STAR FIELDS.
When the stars in this region of sky were formed into a constellation by the Frenchman Nicholas Louis de Lacaille it was called Norma et Regula, the square and the ruler. Changes to constellation boundaries saw the stars marking the ruler being reassigned to neighboring Scorpius. One result of this is that present-day Norma has no stars designated Alpha or Beta. The set-square pattern is made of a right-angled trio of stars that is difficult to make out against the Milky Way.

THE ALTAR
SOUTH OF SCORPIUS, ARA LIES WITHIN THE PATH
OF THE MILKY WAY. ONE OF THE 48 GREEK
CONSTELLATIONS, IT DEPICTS AN ALTAR FROM
ANCIENT GREEK MYTHOLOGY.
Ara was the altar where the Greek gods swore allegiance before entering into battle with the Titans for control of the Universe. Eventually, the gods were victorious and the leading god Zeus placed the altar in the sky in gratitude. The constellation is easy to locate, although its pattern is obscure within the Milky Way’s band of stars. Ara’s brightest stars, Beta and Alpha, and the star cluster NGC 6193, can be seen with the naked eye. Also noteworthy are globular clusters, such as NGC 6397 and NGC 6362, and Mu Arae, a Sun-like star orbited by at least four planets.

AUSTRALIS IS ALSO ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 48
GREEK CONSTELLATIONS, ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT
ASSOCIATED WITH ANY PARTICULAR MYTH.
The pattern of the crown of Corona Australis is not golden and jewel-studded like the Northern Crown, Corona Borealis, but a wreath of leaves. Other cultures saw the stars differently. To the ancient Chinese, its stars represented a turtle, while indigenous Australians saw a boomerang or a coolamon (a shallow dish). None of the constellation’s stars is particularly bright but the curved shape they form makes the constellation easy to spot. Its two brightest stars, Alpha and Beta, appear indistinguishable but are very different. Beta is the bigger and more luminous—although almost four times farther away than Alpha, it shines with the same brightness in our sky. In the north of the constellation a huge region of nebulosity includes NGC 6729, one of the closest star-forming nebulae to us, lying about 400 light-years away.

CHART 3
Piscis Austrinus is said to be the parent of the two fishes that comprise the less obvious constellation Pisces. It is notable for its bright star Fomalhaut, the 18th-brightest star in the night sky. Fomalhaut’s name comes from the Arabic for “fish’s mouth,” which is where it is located in the constellation. This star is also celebrated as the first known to
have a disk of material around it. The disk, which is several times the diameter of our own Solar System, is in the process of forming into planets. One such planet has already been spotted; called Fomalhaut b, it takes about 1,700 years to orbit its parent star. The constellation’s other stars are comparatively faint, and has no deep-sky objects of note.

GRUS
THE CRANE
THIS CONSTELLATION WAS INTRODUCED TO
THE SKY AT THE END OF THE 16TH CENTURY.
ITS DISTINCTIVE FEATURE IS THE LINE OF STARS
RUNNING FROM THE CRANE'S BEAK TO ITS TAIL.
Grus is one of several star patterns devised by Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who made observations of the southern sky during an expedition to the East Indies in 1595. They passed on their observations to the Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius, who created 12 new constellations based on those observations, all of which are still recognized today. (In addition to Grus, these constellations are Apus, Chamaeleon, Dorado, Hydrus, Indus, Musca, Pavo, Phoenix, Triangulum Australe, Tucana, and Volans.) In Grus, the long line of stars through its neck and body can be extended southward to the Small Magellanic Cloud in Tucana. Lying within its neck is the naked-eye double Delta Gruis, which consists of two giants: a yellow magnitude 4.0 star, 150 light-years away; and a red magnitude 4.1 star, 420 light-years away. Other notable objects in Grus include the galaxy NGC 7424 and the planetary nebula IC 5148, popularly called the Spare Tire Nebula.
THE CONSTELLATIONS
Alnair (α Gruis) The brightest star in Grus, at magnitude 1.7. A blue-white subgiant, it is about 3.5 times the diamater of the Sun
Beta (β) Gruis
A variable red giant that changes unpredictably in brightness between magnitudes 2.0 and 2.3 as it swells then shrinks
IC 5148
Also called the Spare Tire nebula, a planetary nebula about 3,000 light-years away. It can be seen with a small telescope as a ring surrounding a white dwarf star
Gamma (γ) Gruis
A blue-white subgiant, about four times the width of the Sun; it is evolving from a main-sequence to a giant star

A ghostly shell of gas cast off by a dying star and resembling a car tire gives this planetary nebula its popular name of the Spare Tire Nebula. The gas shell is a couple of light-years across and is speeding away from a white dwarf (the bright white object in the center of the planetary nebula), which is the remnant of the original star.

MICROSCOPIUM
THE MICROSCOPE
A SMALL AND FAINT SOUTHERN CONSTELLATION
ADDED TO THE SKY IN THE MID-18TH CENTURY,
MICROSCOPIUM IS A ROUGHLY RECTANGULAR
PATTERN OF INDISTINCT STARS.
Microscopium is one of the 14 constellations introduced to the sky by the French astronomer Nicholas Louis de Lacaille. South of Capricornus, it is located between the more prominent constellations of Piscis Austrinus and Sagittarius. Microscopium is an almost featureless constellation with no bright stars and no deep-sky objects except for galaxies too faint for amateur telescopes. Theta is the brightest of several variable stars but its variations are difficult to see, only differing by 0.1 magnitude.

FAINT AND UNREMARKABLE, SCULPTOR IS EASY TO

BRIGHT STAR FOMALHAUT IN PISCIS AUSTRINUS.
IT IS HOME TO SEVERAL INTERESTING GALAXIES.
Sculptor was introduced to the sky by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1754. Originally named Apparatus Sculptoris (the sculptor’s studio), it depicts a marble head, mallet, and chisel on a stand. However, the star pattern is more reminiscent of a shepherd’s crook. None of the stars is named, and all are 4th magnitude or fainter. It contains the Sculptor Group, a cluster of about a dozen galaxies, one of the nearest to our own Local Group. At the Group’s heart is NGC 253, discovered by German-born English astronomer Caroline Herschel in 1783. Close by is globular cluster NGC 288, discovered by her brother William Herschel in 1785.
THE CONSTELLATIONS
△ NGC 253
The largest and brightest of the Sculptor Group, this spiral galaxy is 11 million light-years away but at magnitude 7.5 appears as a fuzzy oval in binoculars. It is classed as a starburst galaxy due to its high rate of star formation.
▷ NGC 300
A spiral galaxy with a poorly defined core and diffuse arms, NGC 300 is close to us at just 6 million light-years away, and probably lies between us and the Sculptor Group.
Alpha (α) Sculptoris
The brightest star in Sculptor, this blue-white giant is 776 light-years away. It is seven times the size of the Sun and 1,700 times its luminosity
NGC 7793
A spiral galaxy measuring 35,000 light-years across and about 13 million light-years away. It is one of the brightest members of the Sculptor Group

CAELUM
THE CHISEL
SMALL AND INSIGNIFICANT, CAELUM IS FORMED
FROM TWO FAINT STARS THAT, LINKED TOGETHER,
REPRESENT AN ENGRAVER’S CHISEL.
One of the smallest constellations in the southern sky, Caelum lies between Eridanus and Columba. It was one of the 14 introduced by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1754. Caelum’s size and position away from the plane of the Milky Way mean that it has few deep-sky objects so its stars are the main objects of interest. Of them, only Alpha, Beta, and Gamma are brighter than magnitude 5.
CAELUM
△ ESO 350-40
About 500 million light-years away and 150,000 lightyears across, this galaxy’s cartwheel shape is the result of a huge galactic collision. A smaller galaxy passed through a larger spiral, producing shock waves that swept up gas and dust. This sparked the birth of billions of stars, seen in blue in the outer ring.
△ Quasar HE 0450-2958
Located toward the north of the constellation, quasar HE0450-2958 is unusual in that its host galaxy is too faint to be seen directly because it is swamped by the quasar’s light. This composite image of it is made up of an infrared image from ESO’s Very Large Telescope and a visible-light image from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Gamma (γ) Caeli An orange giant of magnitude 4.6, this star lies on the constellation’s western boundary. A small telescope reveals it is a binary with a companion of magnitude 8.1
Beta (β) Caeli
A white star moving away from the main sequence to become a giant. It lies 93 light-years away and is of magnitude 5.0
Alpha (α) Caeli This white star is only magnitude 4.5 but it is the brightest in Caelum. Its much dimmer red dwarf companion can be seen with larger telescopes

THE CONSTELLATIONS
FOUND SOUTH OF CETUS, THIS CONSTELLATION’S PATTERN
IS A WIDE “V” SHAPE LINKING THREE STARS. IT IS KNOWN
FOR THE FORNAX CLUSTER OF GALAXIES, AND AS ONE OF
OUR DEEPEST VIEWS INTO THE UNIVERSE.
Originally Fornax Chemica, the chemist’s furnace, Fornax is one of 14 constellations devised by Frenchman Nicolas Louis de Lacaille after surveying the southern sky, in 1751–52. It is home to the Fornax Cluster, a rich cluster of galaxies 62 million light-years away. The brighter members of the 58-strong cluster can be seen with amateur equipment. The elliptical galaxy NGC 1316 (also called Fornax A) is the brightest, and also one of the strongest radio sources in the sky. Barred spiral NGC 1365 is the largest spiral galaxy of the cluster. A tiny region in the north of Fornax was specially imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope. Known as the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, the image contains 10,000 galaxies and is one of our deepest views of the Universe.
FORNAX

△ NGC 1350
The arms in the inner region of this spiral galaxy form a complete ring, resembling a huge eye in space. The blue tint of the outer arms indicates active star formation. Other galaxies are visible through the outer parts. NGC 1350 is about 85 million light years away and 130,000 light-years across.
△ NGC 1097
The large Seyfert galaxy NGC 1097 is magnitude 10.3 and one of the sky’s brightest barred spirals. It is interacting with the tiny elliptical galaxy NGC 1097A at top right. This is not the first small galaxy to be affected by NGC 1097; it engulfed a dwarf galaxy a few billion years ago.
Beta (β) Fornacis
A yellow giant about 11 times the size of the Sun and the second brightest in the constellation
NGC 1316
Also known as Fornax A, this giant elliptical galaxy is a radio source about 60 million light-years away. It was formed by engulfing several smaller galaxies

ARE ITS DISTINCTIVE FEATURE.
Greek mythology relates that this hare was placed in the sky after hares overwhelmed the island of Leros, devastating the land and causing starvation. The constellation was a permanent reminder about the perils of farming too many hares. Lepus is found to the south of Orion, appearing as if in flight from Orion’s two hunting dogs Canis Major and Canis Minor. Its brightest star Alpha Leporis, has the name Arneb which comes from the Arabic for “hare.” It is one of the most luminous stars visible from Earth. However, because of its distance, it is of only average brightness, with magnitude 2.6. The star R Leporis is a pulsating red giant, a Mira variable changing between magnitude 5.5 and 12 over a 430-day cycle. It is also known as Hind’s Crimson Star after English astronomer John Russell Hind who observed it in 1845.

194 THE CONSTELLATIONS
AN ANCIENT CONSTELLATION, CANIS MAJOR IS
THE LARGER OF ORION'S TWO HUNTING DOGS.
IT IS HOST TO SIRIUS, THE BRIGHTEST STAR IN
THE ENTIRE NIGHT SKY.
Canis Major is near the heel of its master Orion, and close by (immediately north of Monoceros) is the smaller constellation Canis Minor. Canis Major represents Laelaps, a mythical dog so swift no prey could escape from it. The constellation is dominated by Sirius, which is actually a fairly average star of its type but outshines all other stars in the night sky because it is so close to us. The second-brightest star, Adhara, is a superluminous blue-white giant, which is much more distant but would outshine Sirius if placed next to it. Since the Milky Way crosses it, the constellation contains several notable deep-sky objects, including the clusters M41 and NGC 2362, both of which can be seen with the naked eye.
CANIS MAJOR
THE GREATER DOG
◁ NGC 2359
This image shows a close-up view of nebula NGC 2359, which is more than 30 light-years across and lies about 12,000 light-years away. Wind from the bright star near its centre is sweeping through the nebula, creating a bubbling effect. A wider-angle view would show two arm-like regions on each side of the nebula, like the wings of a helmet, hence the nebula’s popular name of Thor’s Helmet.

COLUMBA
A FAINT CONSTELLATION LYING SOUTH OF LEPUS,
COLUMBA WAS FORMED IN THE 16TH CENTURY
FROM STARS THAT HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN
ALLOCATED TO ANY OTHER CONSTELLATION.
Invented by the Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius in 1592, Columba was originally called “Columba Noachi” in reference to the dove Noah sent out from the Ark to find dry land, in the Biblical story of the flood. In the constellation, the dove’s body is marked by the star Wezn, and its head end is indicated by the yellow-orange giant Eta Columbae. Its brightest star is Phact, whose name derives from the Arabic for “collared dove.” Mu Columbae is a fast-moving 5th-magnitude star that is thought to have been expelled from the Orion Nebula area. Columba’s most prominent deep-sky object is globular cluster NGC 1851, visible as a faint patch through binoculars.
COLUMBA
THE DOVE
△ NGC 2207 and IC 2163
These two interacting galaxies have created a huge mask shape in space. The gravitational attraction of the larger, NGC 2207, has distorted IC 2163, flinging out stars and gas into streamers at least 100,000 light-years long. The two will continue to slowly fall closer together, forming one huge galaxy in a few billion years’ time.

▷ Star distances
The nearest star to Earth in this constellation’s main pattern stars is Rho (ρ) Puppis, which is 64 light-years away. The most distant star is Xi (ξ) Puppis, which is 2,000 light-years from Earth, about 30 times farther away. Naos (ζ Puppis), the constellation’s brightest pattern star, is also one of the most distant at 1,080 light-years from Earth.
◁ Puppis A
Seen here at X-ray wavelengths, Puppis A is the remains of a supernova explosion some 3,700 years ago. It lies about 7,000 light-years away, about eight times farther than the much larger supernova remnant in neighboring Vela.
◁ NGC 2452
The blue haze in this Hubble Space Telescope image is what remains of the outer layers of a star that have drifted off into space at the end of the star’s life, forming a planetary nebula. At the center of the cloud lies the exposed core of the nebula’s progenitor star.

For the ancient Greeks, Puppis represented the stern, or poop, of the legendary ship Argo in which Jason and his crew sailed on the quest for the golden fleece. The early Greek astronomers visualized Argo as a single large constellation, but in the 1750s it was divided into three by the French astronomer Nicholas Louis de Lacaille. The other two parts of the “ship” are the constellations Carina, the hull, and Vela, the sails. Puppis is the largest of the three. However, the brightest stars of Argo are within Carina and Vela, leaving Puppis with
only second-magnitude Naos, named for the Greek word for ship, as the brightest member of the constellation. Two major star clusters in the north of the constellation create a bright patch in the stream of the Milky Way that runs through here. M47 is the closer and larger of the two, about 1,500 light-years away. Next to it lies M46, over three times as distant and hence more difficult to resolve into individual stars. In the far south of the constellation, NGC 2477 is an even richer and brighter cluster.



198 THE CONSTELLATIONS
△ NGC 2818
More than 10,000 light-years away, this planetary nebula is a star in the process of dying. The outer layers of a once Sun-like star have been pushed off into space. In their center is a white dwarf, the central remains of the original star. Red represents nitrogen, hydrogen is shown in green, and blue is oxygen.

THIS IS A SMALL CONSTELLATION ON THE EDGE OF THE
MILKY WAY WHOSE PATTERN IS A ROW OF THREE STARS.
PYXIS IS A MAGNETIC COMPASS INTRODUCED TO THE
SOUTHERN SKY IN THE 1750s.
Pyxis was devised by the French astronomer Nicholas Louis de Lacaille. After sailing south in 1750 and setting up an observatory at Cape Town, he catalogued the stars of the southern sky and formed some of these into 14 new constellations. The compass is the sort used by seamen and is fittingly next door to Puppis, the ship’s stern. With deep-sky objects such as the barred spiral galaxy NGC 2613 only visible with a large amateur telescope, the constellation’s notable objects are its stars. The variable star T Pyxidis consists of a white dwarf pulling material onto its surface from a larger companion. This causes the white dwarf to erupt unpredictably and increase dramatically in brightness. Its last eruption in 2011 was the first since 1966.

ANTLIA
THIS FAINT CONSTELLATION CONTAINS AN INTERESTING
CLUSTER OF GALAXIES, BUT ANTLIA IS UNREWARDING
FOR THOSE WHO ARE OBSERVING IT WITHOUT USING
A LARGE TELESCOPE.
Antlia was introduced by the French astronomer Nicholas Louis de Lacaille. He formed it out of stars seen from his observatory close to Table Mountain, South Africa. On returning to France, he published a star catalog and a southern-sky map that included Antlia as well as 13 other newly devised constellations. Named Antlia Pneumatica on his map, the constellation represents a vacuum pump. This inconspicuous grouping of stars has no named stars, bright clusters, or nebulae but includes the Antlia Cluster, the third-nearest cluster of galaxies to us. The two 6th-magnitude stars that are designated Zeta form an optical double and can be seen separately through binoculars.

THE AIR PUMP
△ IC 2560
The extremely bright nucleus of spiral galaxy IC 2560 can be seen in this Hubble Space Telescope image. It is caused by the ejection of huge amounts of super-hot gas from the region around the galaxy’s central black hole. IC 2560 is a member of the Antlia Cluster, a cluster of about 250 galaxies.

VELA THE SAILS
VELA IS A MAJOR SOUTHERN CONSTELLATION, FORMERLY PART OF THE LARGER
ANCIENT GREEK CONSTELLATION OF ARGO NAVIS, THE SHIP. LYING IN A RICH PART
OF THE MILKY WAY, VELA CONTAINS THE REMAINS OF A STAR THAT EXPLODED AS
A SUPERNOVA ABOUT 11,000 YEARS AGO.
Vela represents the sails of the mythical ship Argo, the vessel of Jason and the Argonauts. The ancient Greeks visualized the ship as a single huge constellation, but the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille divided it into three smaller parts in the 1750s. The other two sections are Carina, the hull, and Puppis, the stern. Vela contains several prominent star clusters, including IC 2391, a group of about 50 stars visible to the naked eye. Delta
and Kappa Velorum, along with Epsilon and Iota Carinae, form a shape known as the False Cross, which is sometimes mistaken for the true Southern Cross. Vela's most remarkable object is the Vela Supernova remnant. Lying about 800 light-years away, it is among the closest supernova remnants to us. Near its center lies the fast-spinning Vela pulsar, the remaining core of the star that exploded as a supernova in prehistoric times.

▷ Star distances
The nearest of Vela's main pattern stars is Psi (ψ) Velorum, which is only 61 light-years away. The farthest is Phi (φ) Velorum, at about 1,590 light-years. Even though Gamma (γ) Velorum is about 1,00 light-years from us, it is the brightest of Vela's pattern stars. It is also the most luminous, emitting a total amount of energy equivalent to more than 20,300 Suns.

Carina represents the hull of the mythical ship Argo, which the ancient Greeks visualized as a single large constellation. This constellation was split into three (Carina, Vela, the sails, and Puppis, the stern) by the 18th-century French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, and its two brightest stars, Canopus and Miaplacidus, ended up in Carina. Carina contains one of the most extraordinary stars known, Eta Carinae. Currently just visible to the naked eye, it flared up in 1843 to become temporarily brighter than Canopus. It is thought to be a massive binary, obscured by the debris thrown off in the great eruption. It lies within the Carina Nebula (see pp.204–205), a cloud of gas that is larger and brighter than the Orion Nebula. The stars Epsilon and Iota Carinae, together with Delta and Kappa Velorum, form the so-called False Cross, an asterism that resembles the true Southern Cross.

A bright area of glowing gas surrounds the binary star Eta Carinae (center left of the image), thrown off in its eruption of 1843. Eta Carinae lies within the Carina Nebula, which includes the region called the Keyhole (the elongated darker area just right of Eta Carinae).
△ NGC 3603
This combined visible light and infrared image reveals an enormous cavity in the gas around the massive star cluster NGC 3603. The cavity was created by ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from young, hot stars in the cluster.



DUST CLOUDS IN CARINA
Fantasy-like structures are found throughout the Carina Nebula, a vast molecular cloud of star birth that spans across 300 light-years of space. This detailed color-enhanced view shows a small part, roughly 15 light-years wide. The fantastic shapes are sculpted out of the cold cloud by stellar winds and ultra-violet radiation emitted by massive stars, as they slowly erode it away. Dark knots of gas and dust are so thick they are opaque, although the cloud is typically
less dense than Earth’s atmosphere. The dark pillar of cold hydrogen and dust to the right of this image is more than two light-years long, and has so far resisted being worn away. Inside it new stars are taking shape. The image was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope and combines two sets of observations. The first, from 2005, were taken in light emitted by hydrogen atoms. The second, taken in 2010, were in light emitted by oxygen atoms.

Also sometimes called the Spiral Planetary Nebula, NGC 5189 is a planetary nebula with expelled material rushing away from a dying star, a white dwarf. Unusually, NGC 5189 has two central stars; the white dwarf and a Wolf–Rayet type star. The presence of the two stars explains the complex structure of the surrounding gas.
◁ RCW 86
This colorful band of gas and dust is part of a roughly circular supernova remnant named RCW 86. It is material left over from a time when a white dwarf exploded after siphoning material from a nearby star.

Indus is one of the 12 figures invented by Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who charted the sky of the Southern Hemisphere during the 1590s. The Indian figure carries a spear and arrows, and is drawn around three stars that form a right angle in the northern part of the constellation. Indus’s brightest stars are of 3rd-magnitude and it has no significant star clusters or nebulae. One notable star is Epsilon Indi, a yellow main-sequence, agnitude-4.7 star just 11.2 lightyears away, making it one of the closest stars to us.

DORADO
THE GOLDFISH
A CHAIN OF STARS NEAR THE BRILLIANT STAR
CANOPUS IN CARINA, DORADO INCLUDES THE
IMPRESSIVE LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD, A
NEIGHBORING GALAXY OF THE MILKY WAY.
Although commonly described as a goldfish and sometimes depicted as a swordfish, Dorado represents the dolphinfish, a species found in tropical waters. Its shape is drawn around a faint chain of stars, with the fish swimming toward the south celestial pole. The constellation was introduced to the southern sky in the 1590s by the Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. It has no very bright stars, and none are named. Its most spectacular feature, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), is visible to the naked eye but binoculars reveal its numerous star clusters and nebulous patches in more detail. The LMC is named after Ferdinand Magellan, the Portuguese explorer who recorded it in the early 1520s. The Tarantula Nebula is part of the LMC, and the Supernova 1987A was seen in the outskirts of this nebula in 1987.

THE CONSTELLATIONS
CONTAINING ONLY FAINT STARS, PICTOR WAS
INTRODUCED IN THE 1750S. IT IS FOUND
BETWEEN THE STAR CANOPUS IN CARINA AND
THE LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD IN DORADO.
Pictor is said to represent an artist’s easel although its star pattern bears little resemblance to one. It is one of 14 constellations introduced by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille after observing the southern stars in the 1750s. A generally unremarkable constellation, it nevertheless has some interesting stars. Close-up views of Beta Pictoris reveal it is surrounded by a disk of planet-making material that extends more than 1,000 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun. A planet, named Beta Pictoris b, has already been identified in the inner disk. It has the mass of about nine Jupiters and is almost as close to its parent star as Saturn is to the Sun. The red dwarf Kapteyn’s Star is the second-fastest moving star in the sky (after Barnard’s Star in Ophiuchus).

A FAINT DIAMOND SHAPE OF STARS
IN THE SOUTHERN SKY, RETICULUM IS
LOCATED NORTHWEST OF THE LARGE
MAGELLANIC CLOUD IN DORADO.
The stars in this region were first grouped together in 1621 as the constellation Rhombus, the diamond, by German astronomer Isaac Habrecht. It was given its current description in the 1750s by French astronomer Nicolas Louise de Lacaille. The name refers to the reticule, the gridlike crosshairs in a telescope’s eyepiece used to measure the positions of the stars. One of the smallest constellations, its principal attractions are the double star Zeta Reticuli and some faint galaxies, including NGC 1313, a starburst galaxy where unusually large numbers of hot young stars are forming, and NGC 1559, a spiral galaxy 50 million light-years away.
RETICULUM
THE NET
THIS INDISTINCT CONSTELLATION
IS SITUATED BETWEEN THE BRIGHT
STARS OF CARINA AND THE SOUTH
CELESTIAL POLE.
Volans was described by the Dutch explorers Peter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman in the 1590s. Its most interesting features are its double stars, such as Gamma Volantis, visible with a small telescope, and its galaxies, which can be seen only with large telescopes. Like a huge letter “S”, NGC 2442 has an arm coming from each end of a bar. Nicknamed the “Meathook,” its distorted shape is the result of a near-miss with a smaller galaxy. Formerly a spiral, AM 0644-741 is a now a ring galaxy as a result of a collision with another galaxy.

THE CONSTELLATIONS
A SMALL AND INSIGNIFICANT CONSTELLATION
NEAR THE SOUTH CELESTIAL POLE, CHAMELEON
WAS ONE OF THE CONSTELLATIONS INTRODUCED
IN THE 1590S BY PETRUS PLANCIUS.
Chamaeleon’s faint diamond pattern of stars lies between the star fields of Carina and the South Celestial Pole in Octans. None of its stars is bright and there are no associated legends. Eta Chamaeleontis is the brightest star in an open star cluster, and Delta Chamaeleontis is a pair of unrelated stars. The Chamaeleon I Cloud is a star-forming nebula some 500 light-years away.
CHAMAELEON
THE CHAMELEON
ONE OF THE 12 FAR SOUTHERN CONSTELLATIONS
INTRODUCED AT THE END OF THE 16TH
CENTURY, THIS TROPICAL BIRD IS DRAWN
AROUND A CHAIN OF FOUR INDISTINCT STARS.
Apus lies south of an obvious triangle of stars, Triangulum Australe, and occupies an almost featureless area near the South Celestial Pole. It was devised by Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman after seeing the exotic bird-of-paradise during their explorations of New Guinea in the 1590s. Sharp eyes or binoculars show that the constellation’s most interesting star, Delta Apodis, is a double—a wide pair of unrelated red giants of magnitudes 4.7 and 5.3, 310 light-years away. Other notable features are Theta Apodis, a red giant varying between magnitudes 6.4 and 8.0 about every four months, and the globular clusters IC 4499 and NGC 6101.

TUCANA
THIS CONSTELLATION DEPICTING THE TOUCAN, A LARGE-BEAKED
TROPICAL BIRD, WAS INTRODUCED TO THE FAR SOUTHERN SKY IN
THE LATE 16TH CENTURY. IT IS FAINT AND HAS AN INDISTINCT PATTERN,
BUT IT IS HOST TO SOME SIGNIFICANT CELESTIAL OBJECTS.
Located south of Phoenix and Grus, west of Hydrus, and southwest of the bright star Achernar in Eridanus, Tucana is one of 12 constellations devised by Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. It was first depicted on a globe by fellow Dutchman Petrus Plancius in 1598. None of the constellation’s stars is named and there are no legends associated with it. However, Tucana
is notable for two important features: the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and 47 Tucanae. The SMC is the smaller of the Milky Way’s two major satellite galaxies (the other is the Large Magellanic Cloud, in Dorado and Mensa). A compact globular cluster, 47 Tucanae (also known as NGC 104) contains several million stars and is the second-brightest globular cluster visible from Earth in the night sky.

▽ NGC 346
Located within the Small Magellanic Cloud, this star-forming region contains more than 2,500 infant stars. A cluster of dozens of hot blue stars lies at its heart. Energy from these stars is sculpting the surrounding nebula. Other newborn stars, which have not yet started the nuclear fusion process that will make them shine, are within the nebula.

THE CONSTELLATIONS
REPRESENTING THE EYE-CATCHING BIRD FROM INDIA, PAVO WAS FIRST DEPICTED
ON A CELESTIAL GLOBE IN 1598. THE CONSTELLATION IS FOUND ON THE EDGE OF
THE MILKY WAY, SOUTH OF TELESCOPIUM AND BETWEEN ARA AND INDUS.
Pavo is one of the 12 constellations devised by the Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who voyaged in the Southern Hemisphere in the late 16th century and catalogued its stars. It is in a fairly featureless area of the sky but easily spotted because of its brightest star, Alpha Pavonis. Named Peacock in the late 1930s, it marks the bird’s head. Pavo’s flamboyant
open tail feathers are drawn around a rectangle of stars. In the middle of this is Kappa Pavonis, a yellow supergiant, and one of the brightest Cepheid variables in the sky. Visible to the naked eye, this star varies in brightness every 9.1 days between magnitudes 3.9 and 4.8 as it expands and contracts. Pavo also contains an impressively bright globular cluster, NGC 6752, also visible to the naked eye.

IN NEIGHBORING ERIDANUS. IT IS SOMETIMES CONFUSED WITH HYDRA, THE
WATER SNAKE, BUT THE LATTER IS MUCH BIGGER AND LIES FARTHER NORTH.
Hydrus is situated between the Large Magellanic Cloud in Dorado and the Small Magellanic Cloud in Tucana, with the star Achernar to the north. It is one of the 12 constellations introduced by the Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman in the 16th century. The snake pattern of the constellation is indistinct, and its bright stars are more easily thought of as a triangle, with Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Hydri at the corners. North of Gamma is VW Hydri, a nova that
explodes roughly once a month, and is easy to see with a small telescope. An outlying region of the Small Magellanic Cloud lies just within Hydrus.

A FAINT AND UNREMARKABLE SOUTHERN
SKY CONSTELLATION, HOROLOGIUM
HOSTS A DISTANT GLOBULAR CLUSTER
BUT CONTAINS NO BRIGHT STARS.
Horologium occupies a region of sky that contains a sparse collection of stars, none of which is brighter than magnitude 3.9. It is one of the 14 constellations introduced by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the 1750s. A horologium was the type of clock used for precision timekeeping in astronomical observatories of the time. The center of the clock’s face is marked by the star Alpha Horologii and the pendulum “swings” between Beta and Lambda, but the picture can be reversed so that Alpha marks the bottom of the pendulum. Horologium’s deep-sky objects include Arp–Madore 1, the most distant globular cluster orbiting the Milky Way.

THE FAINTEST CONSTELLATION OF ALL,
MENSA IS NEAR THE SOUTH CELESTIAL
POLE. THE LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD
IS ON ITS BORDER WITH DORADO.
Small and faint, Mensa was devised by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. He named it “Mons Mensae” after Table Mountain, near Cape Town, South Africa, close to where he observed the southern skies in the 1750s. Mensa is the only one of the 14 constellations he defined that is not a scientific or artistic tool. Its most notable feature is the part of the Large Magellanic Cloud that Mensa includes.

Devised in the 1750s by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, this constellation was named for the then recently invented navigational instrument and forerunner to the better-known sextant, the octant. Its most notable feature is Sigma Octantis, the nearest naked-eye star to the South Celestial Pole. Gamma Octantis is a chain of three unrelated stars, two yellow and one orange giant, usually able to be distinguished by the naked eye.

THE
SOLAR SYSTEM






AROUND THE SUN
◁ Surface of the Sun
At the high temperatures close to our star, almost all the gas present is split into charged particles—a plasma—through which weaves a tangled jumble of magnetic fields. The complex churning of the Sun’s braided surface overlies the primary source of heat and light in our Solar System: the nuclear furnace that is buried in the star’s interior.
have been known since ancient times, from their
wanderings among the stars in our night skies.
Through the use of telescopes and space-based
observatories, two more planets, hundreds of
moons, and more than a million smaller objects,
including comets and asteroids left over from the
Solar System’s formation, have also been found.
The planets orbit the Sun in a disk, with the paths
of smaller bodies generally becoming more scattered
farther away from the Sun. The innermost planets
Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are small, solid
globes made up primarily of rock and metals. In
contrast, the outer worlds—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
and Neptune—are giants formed of gas and liquid,
each accompanied by a multitude of their own
natural satellites. Despite the extensive knowledge
we have of our neighbors, we may not yet fully
appreciate the scale of our planetary system.
Indeed, large bodies may lie yet undiscovered
in the dark extremities of our Solar System.
Of the estimated 200 billion stars that make up the
Milky Way, our home galaxy, only one is vital to our
existence: a fairly unremarkable main-sequence star
that we call the Sun. As is the case for most other
stars in the galaxy, the Sun did not form in isolation.
Its mighty gravitational pull keeps hold of a family
of bodies that formed with it, the largest of which
we know as the planets. Five of these other worlds



THE SOLAR SYSTEM
THE SOLAR SYSTEM FORMED FROM A SLOWLY ROTATING
NEBULA OF GAS AND DUST AROUND 4.6 BILLION YEARS AGO.
THE PLANETS AND COUNTLESS MINOR BODIES THAT ORBIT THE
SUN WERE FORMED FROM ACCUMULATIONS OF GAS AND DUST.
THE SOLAR SYSTEM
The distances from the Sun at which planets formed largely control their compositions, with the ices of water, methane, and other molecules becoming more dominant in the planets far from our star’s warmth. The Solar System is much larger than just the orbits of the planet, continuing far beyond Neptune. Beyond the eighth planet lies a scattered disk of icy worlds, some of which are hundreds of miles across. Further than that is thought to lie a spherical cloud of small icy objects, known as the Oort Cloud.
▽ The orbits of the planets
All the planets follow stable paths around the Sun. These paths are almost circular and are close to lying in a flat disk. The speed of the planets’ motion depends on their distances from the Sun, so Mercury travels far more rapidly than Neptune. Comets, trans-Neptunian objects, and many asteroids follow more elliptical orbits, during which their distance from the Sun varies considerably. Some long-period comets follow extremely elongated paths that take them from very close to the Sun to vast distances away over periods of thousands of years.
Mercury The smallest planet speeds around the Sun once every 88 Earth days Mars Chilly Mars has a thin atmosphere and is conceivably a home for primitive life
Venus Almost Earth’s twin in size, this planet has a thick, hot, noxious atmosphere
Saturn Dominated by its vast rings, the second-largest planet is the least dense in the Solar System
Earth Our home orbits the Sun at just the right distance for liquid water to exist
The Sun This star contains over 99.8 percent of the total mass of the Solar System
224
Jupiter
Orbiting almost 5 times farther from the Sun than Earth does, this vast body is more massive than all other planets put together
Main asteroid belt Most rocky minor bodies occupy the space between Mars and Jupiter



Rocky planets
The planets nearest the Sun—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—contain far more rock and metal than gas. Each one has a surface shaped by volcanoes, where hot, molten material from the interior has broken through the solid crust. Apart from Mercury, these planets possess a significant atmosphere that has protected its surface, to varying degrees, from impacts. These atmospheres may have largely originated in asteroid and comet impacts, with the latter possibly also delivering large quantities of water to the planets. Only Earth and Mars have moons. Mars’s natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos, are believed to be captured asteroids.
Gas planets
The four outer worlds—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are bloated giants largely formed of gas surrounding a dense core, each accompanied by a large retinue of moons. When young, these planets grew large enough to draw in gas from the surrounding nebula. The motions of their churning atmospheres are driven by internal heat as well as energy from sunlight. Given their cold environments far from the Sun, these planets’ many moons are predominantly worlds with water ice crusts, some heated inside due to the effects of tides. Some of these satellites have atmospheres, and others have active volcanoes.
Minor bodies
In the early Solar System, dust and ice grains first formed small bodies, and these then accumulated to form the planets. Billions of the small bodies did not, however, become parts of planets, and they remain as minor bodies today. These are the asteroids and comets, and studying their make-up can tell us much about conditions in the early Solar System. The smallest of these—some are mere dust grains—enter our atmosphere, appearing as meteors. Many larger minor bodies, however, present Earth with a threat should a collision occur. Their rare impacts can potentially lead to global disruption, as is thought to have occurred 65 million years ago, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs.
△ Comets
Comets, such as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (shown here), are small, icy bodies. As they approach the Sun, their ice turns into gas, releasing dust to create tails millions of miles long.
△ Dwarf planets and Trans-Neptunian objects
Numerous icy bodies orbit beyond Neptune, in a flat disk known as the Kuiper Belt. Several of these are large enough to be classed as dwarf planets, including Pluto (shown here).
△ Asteroids
Most of these bodies, such as 951 Gaspra (shown here), are too small to form spheres. Despite being mostly rocky, several are now known to possess water ice under their surface.

Neptune The most distant known planet lies more than 30 times farther from the Sun than does Earth



226 THE SOLAR SYSTEM
▷ Saturn's aurora
Like Earth and most other planets, Saturn has a magnetosphere. The interaction between the solar wind and the planet’s magnetic field generates aurora near its poles, as occurs on our planet. Here, ultraviolet light shows the southern lights near the South Pole.
△ Earth’s magnetosphere
Our planet is protected from the solar wind by its magnetic field. This magnetic bubble, called the magnetosphere, allows the solar wind to usually only affect Earth near the poles, where the northern and southern lights—the aurorae—are seen.

Near Earth, charged particles are trapped by the magnetic field

THE SUN
ESSENTIAL TO LIFE ON EARTH BY PROVIDING US WITH
WARMTH AND LIGHT, THE SUN MAY SEEM SPECIAL,
BUT IT IS JUST A TYPICAL STAR. AS IT IS SO CLOSE TO
US, IT HAS BEEN STUDIED IN GREAT DETAIL.
Measuring 863,000 miles (1.39 million km) across and rotating every 24.5 days, the Sun is a nuclear fusion furnace in which atoms are crushed together in its core, releasing vast quantities of heat and light. The surface that we see, at 10,800°F (6,000°C), is only part of a complex, seething jumble of magnetic field and charged particles. Almost everything we can see on the Sun is in a state of matter called a plasma, where gas has separated into negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions (atoms or molecules that have lost electrons). The Sun has an activity cycle of around 11 years, during which the numbers of sunspots, flares, and eruptions rise and fall significantly.
The solar wind
A flow of charged particles, called the solar wind, flows continuously from the Sun into space at hundreds of miles per second. This wind carves out an enormous bubble in space called the heliosphere; Earth and all the other planets orbit within it, shielded from interstellar space. Like weather on the Earth, the solar wind is variable. It can be gusty, and its effects on planets and comets can change abruptly.
Earth’s magnetic field gets stretched out on the side farthest from the Sun



227
Surface features
Almost all the features seen on the Sun are controlled by its magnetic field. Large-scale dark patches in hot plasma indicate coronal holes, which are the source of much of the solar wind. The magnetic field at these holes escapes into space with the wind. Bright patches indicate tightly bunched, twisted magnetic fields trapping hot plasma, and are termed active regions. They usually overlie sunspots. When an active region erupts, it becomes a solar flare, which is bright at all wavelengths for minutes or longer.
△ Prominence
A lifted, plumelike region of cooler, denser plasma that emerges from the Sun’s visible surface (the photosphere) is called a prominence.
THE SUN
△ Sunspots
These dark regions are cooler than their surroundings, but are still extremely hot. They indicate where bundles of magnetic fields from the Sun’s interior have broken through the surface.
△ Coronal mass ejections
These are eruptions of plasma that are sent out into space. They occur with a range of sizes and speeds. Some can have dramatic effects on Earth’s magnetosphere.
This image is showing a layer in the Sun’s atmosphere called the chromosphere, which lies above the visible photosphere
△ The Sun in ultraviolet light
By observing the Sun at different wavelengths, we see components of different temperature. This ultraviolet view shows material that is around 108,000°F (60,000°C), or ten times hotter than the visible surface. It is much more highly structured than the visible light view, showing bright areas of dense, hot plasma, and cooler, dark areas, termed filaments, suspended above the surface by magnetic fields.

228
THE INNER
PLANETS
THE INNER PLANETS, INCLUDING OUR OWN PLANET,
ARE ALL ROCKY BODIES. BASKING IN THE WARMTH
RELATIVELY CLOSE TO THE SUN, ALL THESE FOUR BODIES
HAVE SOLID, ROCKY CRUSTS, BUT ARE DIVERSE WORLDS.
The sizes of the planets’ atmospheres are controlled by their gravitational pull. Mercury is too small to sustain any significant atmosphere. Mars’s air is gradually being lost, and was previously be much more extensive. Venus and Earth can retain thick atmospheres.
Venus
Despite almost being Earth’s twin in terms of size, with a diameter of 7,521 miles (12,104 km), Venus has evolved along a very different path to our planet. The planet rotates very slowly every 243 Earth days and is covered in outflows from many volcanoes. Its extremely thick atmosphere gives it a surface pressure 90 times higher than Earth’s, at a temperature of around 860°F (460°C).
Mercury
With a diameter of 3,032 miles (4,879 km), Mercury is the smallest of the terrestrial planets. It is, however, very dense. It has a huge iron core that generates a planet-wide magnetic field, similar to that of Earth. The planet has an extremely thin atmosphere that barely differs from a vacuum, much of which is kicked up by particles from the Sun striking the surface. It is a world of temperature extremes, extending from -274 to 788° F (-170 to 420° C).
◁ Mercury crater
Fresh impact craters like this one show that Mercury’s soil and rocks are varied in composition. This strike by a small asteroid has thrown up bright material from just under the surface.
The filtering of sunlight by Venus’s thick clouds makes its mostly gray surface appear orange
Mercury’s surface is similar to the Moon in appearance: covered in countless impact craters, but also some smooth areas formed from lava flows.
THE SOLAR SYSTEM
△ Venus surface
Radar observations that can penetrate Venus’s thick clouds reveal its surface to be almost entirely covered by volcanoes and lava flows; there are very few impact craters.
Infrared radiation trapped by atmosphere
Sunlight
Thick layers of cloud
◁ The greenhouse effect The extremely high surface temperature on Venus is due to its thick atmosphere and clouds. The gases surrounding the planet allow in some sunlight, which heats the planet’s surface. The warmed ground glows at infrared wavelengths. The atmosphere prevents this heat from escaping into space.



229
Earth
Our home is the largest of the inner planets, measuring 7,926 miles (12,756 km) across. Earth’s surface has few visible impact craters—their remains have mostly been erased by the effects of air and water. The vast seas hide a unique feature: the ocean floor is being gradually replenished by fresh rock from long chains of underwater volcanoes. The sea floor moves very gradually like a giant conveyor belt, sinking back into the interior under the continents.
Mars
Mars has a surface almost equal in area to that of Earth’s continents. The so-called Red Plant, at 4,220 miles- (6,792 km-) wide and most similar to Earth at its surface, is one of the few other places in our Solar System where life could have arisen, and may even exist today (see p.82). The planet’s air is now too thin to support liquid water for long, even when the temperature creeps above 32°F (0° C). There is, however, plenty of evidence that the air was once thicker, and conditions for Martian life were much better billions of years ago.
△ Earth tilt and axial rotation
As Earth’s spin axis is tilted by 23.5°, a part of it is always tilted toward the Sun. This gives rise to the seasons. During half of the year, the Northern Hemisphere receives most sunlight, and the Southern Hemisphere receives most during the other half.
△ Water and life
Earth’s distance from the Sun and the thickness of its atmosphere allow water to exist as a liquid, solid, and gas. The presence of liquid water is thought to have been essential for life to begin here. Why Earth has quite so much water is currently unknown.
△ Mars surface
Few worlds have terrains as diverse as Mars, from its heavily cratered ancient lands to smooth plains and plunging canyons. Its highest volcano, Olympus Mons, reaches 15 miles (25 km) above the planet’s rocky surface, while the huge Valles Marineris canyon plunges 4 miles (7 km) below the surrounding plains.
△ Evidence of water
Mars displays features such as channels and canyons that clearly indicate that water flowed on its surface in the ancient past. There are also signs of brief water flows today, as seen on the slopes of this crater. Sunlight is thought to melt water ice buried under the surface, which flows before evaporating in the thin air.
Most the surface rocks on Mars have been oxidized, like the rust seen on some metals, giving them an orange colour.

Earth's rotation



230
Jupiter
Measuring 88,846 miles (142,984 km) across, its equator could fit ten Earths side-by-side. The largest planet’s great mass affects the orbits of many bodies, and numerous comets’ orbits have been altered by its presence. This vast planet has an extremely strong magnetic field. High energy particles are trapped by this field, making it a dangerous place for human exploration.
◁ Giant Red Spot
This spectacular, churning storm has existed in Jupiter’s atmosphere for at least 300 years. Typically measuring 18,600 miles (30,000 km) across, Earth would fit inside it two or three times. It varies in shape and darkness, and its red color is probably due to chemicals being drawn up from deeper in the atmosphere.
▷ Europa
This large moon of Jupiter is a world of ice. Europa’s cracked surface covers a global ocean of water heated by the effects of tides. This combination of water and heat means it’s one of the few places where life could have arisen.
THE OUTER
PLANETS
UNLIKE THE ROCKY COMPOSITION OF THE INNER PLANETS, THE
FOUR GIANT OUTER PLANETS ARE LARGELY MADE OF GAS. THESE
MASSIVE BODIES HAVE DOZENS OF MOONS, EACH FORMING A
MINIATURE PLANETARY SYSTEM.
All four outer planets are much larger than Earth. Despite their size, they all have days shorter than Earth’s. This rapid rotation leads to their atmosphere splitting up into bands. Visits by spacecraft have shown that they all possess a magnetic field, and aurorae occur in their atmospheres. The four bodies all have ring systems, but Saturn has the most extensive by far.
Saturn
Measuring over 75,898 miles (120,536 km) across, Saturn is the second-largest planet. It has a banded atmosphere similar to Jupiter’s, but its cloud structures are more muted. The planet is surrounded by an extensive ring system, probably the remains of a destroyed moon. Its largest moon, Titan, has a thick atmosphere with a surface pressure higher than that at Earth's surface.
△ Saturn's rings
Saturn’s rings are composed of chunks of almost pure water ice, with a tiny amount of dust. One of the largest rings, called the E ring, is still fed by ice grains erupting from the moon Enceladus.
Jupiter’s bands alternate between light-colored regions of rising air and darker regions of falling air
THE SOLAR SYSTEM



◁ Enceladus
This moon, at 313 miles (504 km) wide, is the most reflective body in the Solar System. Its bright water-ice surface covers a liquid ocean, which might be a haven for life. Icy grains and water vapor erupt into space from ice volcanoes near the moon’s south pole.
△ Neptune's clouds
In 1982, after journeying to the far edges of the Solar System, Voyager 2 found a scene reminiscent of Earth. However, these white clouds in Neptune’s atmosphere are thought to be frozen methane.
Uranus
The first planet to be discovered through the use of a telescope, Uranus is a bizarre world. Measuring at 31,763 miles (51,118 km) wide, it spins on its side, resulting in extreme seasons. The atmosphere is very bland around midwinter, but bursts into activity when the Sun heats the equator. The planet’s thin rings were first discovered in 1977, when they briefly blocked the light from a distant star.
▷ Uranus structure
The planet has a sizeable solid core, which is likely to have formed from an icy body that grew large enough to draw in gas during its early history.
Neptune
This planet’s presence and rough location were predicted due to its effect on other planets. Neptune is 30,500 miles (49,775 km) wide and has a much more active atmosphere than Uranus, possessing huge storms. It has a large moon, Triton, whose backward orbit indicates that it was captured by Neptune in the distant past. Neptune’s rings are uneven, consisting of concentrated arcs of material trapped inside tenuous rings.
The rings are split into regions of varying density, shepherded by the gravitational effects of Saturn’s moons
Uranus’s blue color is due to the methane in its atmosphere absorbing red light
Neptune’s weather activity and fast winds indicate that there’s a source of heat in the planet’s interior
As for all the giant planets, Neptune’s atmosphere is primarily hydrogen and helium. Like Uranus, it also contains methane



232
THE MOON
EARTH IS THE ONLY PLANET IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM WITH A MOON
COMPARABLE IN SIZE TO ITSELF, BUT OUR NATURAL SATELLITE IS A
COMPLETELY DRY, AIRLESS ENVIRONMENT.
Formation and structure
The Moon was almost certainly formed when a large, Mars-sized body struck a young Earth, throwing debris into space that eventually merged to form the body we see today. Its orbit has gradually widened and lengthened, and today, the Moon orbits Earth every 27.3 days. The Moon’s interior was once warm enough for many volcanic eruptions, but such activity has now stopped.
Surface features
The Moon’s surface has been pounded by countless impacts for billions of years. Much of the ground is covered by craters of all sizes. Looking by eye from Earth, the obvious features on the Moon are its dark patches. These, the seas, or maria, are where very fluid lava flooded large impact basins. These large eruptions ended just over a billion years ago.
THE SOLAR SYSTEM
◁ Hayn impact crater This typical impact crater was formed when an asteroid or comet hit the Moon. It has a flat floor and central peaks, where the Moon’s surface rebounded.
◁ Sink hole
This pit, less than 330 ft (100 m) across, is where a sub-surface channel that once carried lava has collapsed. Similar features are seen in volcanic areas on Earth.
◁ Lava plain
The maria are vast expanses of lava that have covered several large areas of the Moon. They are not, however, perfectly smooth. Wrinkle ridges show where the lava cooled and shrank.
△ Offset structure
Tidal forces created by Earth's gravity early in the Moon's history distorted the Moon's symmetry.
Core offset toward Earth
Crust is thicker on the side farthest from Earth
Mare Imbrium (Sea of Rains) is one of the largest of the lunar maria



233
Earth's satellite
The Moon is responsible for the tides in Earth’s seas: it pulls water toward it, thereby raising a bulge on one side of the planet. Another bulge forms on the opposite side of the planet, where the Moon’s gravity is weakest. The Moon’s presence may also have stabilized Earth’s spin axis, which has helped life develop here.
THE MOON
△ Earth and Moon still
The differences between the surfaces of our planet and the Moon are obvious in this image. The grayish lunar surface reflects only 12 percent of the light falling on it, whilst the colorful Earth reflects around 30 percent. The Moon’s far side, never seen from Earth, is visible here.
△ Phases of the Moon
The Moon shows phases during its orbit around the Earth, as the amount of sunlit ground seen from Earth varies. The orbit isn’t circular since the distance between Earth and the Moon varies from 225,300 to 251,900 miles (362,600 to 405,400 km).
△ Astronauts on the Moon
Twelve astronauts walked on the Moon between 1969 and 1972, during six Apollo missions. Their work, and the study of the rocks and soil that they returned to Earth, transformed lunar science.
This image, taken between the Earth and the Sun, shows our planet almost fully illuminated
Only a small amount of the Moon’s far side is covered in maria
◁ Near side of the Moon
It takes the Moon the same amount of time to spin on its own axis as it takes for it to orbit Earth. Known as synchronous rotation, it means that the side of the Moon shown here is always facing Earth.

Bright stars
The stars seen at night have different brightnesses. Sirius, the brightest, appears about 1,000 times brighter than the faintest seen with the naked eye. The ancient Greek astronomer, Hipparchus, grouped the stars into “importance” categories, 1 being the brightest and 6 the
faintest. Today we call these importances “apparent magnitudes.” Each unit of apparent magnitude is 2.51 times fainter than the one before. A star’s absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude it would have if at a standard distance of 32.6 light-years.

Stellar giants
The vast majority of stars are too far away to have their radii measured directly. Size is usually estimated using a physical law that links radius, energy output, and surface temperature. Because many of the biggest stars pulsate, the resulting size accuracy is only about 10 percent. Theoretically, it has been estimated that giant stars become unstable if bigger than about 1,500 times the size of the Sun. The orbits of Earth and Jupiter are 215 and 1,120 the radius of the Sun, so all the stars in this list are bigger than Jupiter’s orbit
Nearby stars and star groups
Over 90 percent of the Sun’s neighbors are main-sequence stars, and 50 percent are in binary or triple groups. Typically, the average spacing is about seven light-years. It would take spacecraft such Voyager 1 about 100,000 years to travel this far.
Proxima Centauri will remain the closest star to the Sun for the next 25,000 years, after which Alpha Centauri takes over. This list will slowly change as the Sun travels around its Galactic orbit every 225,000,000 years.

Patterns in the sky
The sky is divided into 88 areas, most of which contain a recognizable pattern of stars. These constellations help astronomers name stars, describe the positions of planets and comets, and generally find their way around. The naming of celestial regions started around 4,000 years ago.
Around 150 CE, Ptolemy listed the 48 constellations that could be seen from the Mediterranean region. In the 1590s Dutch explorers increased this list when they travelled across the equator to the southern oceans. More additions were made by astronomers in the 17th Century.

The Local Group
The Local Group of galaxies is a gravitationally bound cluster of over 54 galaxies, mainly dwarfs, and is about 10 million light-years across. It is dominated by three giant galaxies; the Milky Way, Andromeda, and Triangulum. Each of these has a swarm of orbiting smaller satellite
galaxies. The Local Group was first recognized in 1936 by the American astronomer Edwin Hubble. The membership of some of the outliers (such as Antlia Dwarf, Sextans A, and NGC 3109) is debatable. Other, as yet undiscovered, members could be hidden behind the giant galaxies.

Galaxy clusters and groups
Galaxies in the Universe are not distributed at random. They are in gravitationally bound groups containing tens to thousands of individuals. Dominating our region is The Great Attractor (the main component of which is the Norma Cluster). This is so massive it affects the normal expansion of the Universe discovered by Edwin Hubble. Clusters accumulate together to form superclusters. Cluster diameters are between 6 and 30 million light-years.

Deep-sky catalog
The French astronomer Charles Messier (1730–1817) produced a catalog of nebulae and star clusters easily visible in small telescopes. His designations (for example M31 for Andromeda Galaxy) are still much in use today. Messier was a comet hunter (he discovered 13)
and did not want to confuse transient comets with similar-looking permanent bodies. He used a 10-cm refractor telescope in Paris, so objects south of -35.7o declination were not included. His catalog, started in 1760, finally listed 110 objects.

Accretion
(1) The colliding and sticking together of small astronomical bodies to make larger ones. (2) The process whereby a body grows in mass by accumulating matter from its surroundings.
Active galaxy
A galaxy that emits an exceptional amount of electromagnetic radiation over a wide range of wavelengths. The radiation comes from a central “active galactic nucelus” and is thought to be powered by the accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole. There are several named types, although the apparent differences between them may be because we are viewing them at different angles as seen from Earth. See also blazar, quasar, Seyfert galaxy
Apparent magnitude

A natural satellite is an astronomical body that orbits a planet, otherwise known as a moon. An artificial satellite is an object deliberately put in orbit around Earth or another planet.
Seyfert galaxy
A spiral galaxy with an exceptionally bright central region. Seyfert galaxies are believed to be similar to quasars, although less powerful and found closer to our own galaxy. See also active galaxy
Singularity
A point of infinite density into which matter has been compressed by gravity, and a point at which the known laws of physics break down. Theory implies that a singularity exists at the center of a black hole. See also black hole
Solar flare
A violent release of huge amounts of energy from a localized region on the surface of the Sun.
Solar System
The Sun together with the eight planets, smaller bodies (dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, comets, trans-Neptunian objects), dust, and gas that orbit the Sun.
Solar wind
A constant stream of fast-moving particles that escapes from the Sun and flows outward through the Solar System.
Spacetime
The combination of the three dimensions of space (length, breadth, height) and the single time dimension. See also relativity
Spiral galaxy
A galaxy that consists of a central concentration of stars surrounded by a flattened disk of stars, gas, and dust, within which the major visible features are clumped together into spiral arms. See also barred spiral galaxy
Star
A huge sphere of glowing plasma that generates energy by means of nuclear reactions at its center. See also fusion, plasma
Star cluster
A group of stars bound together by gravity. See also globular cluster, open cluster
Subgiant star
A star that is significantly more luminous than a main-sequence star of the same surface temperature and color.
Sunspot
A region of intense magnetic activity in the Sun’s photosphere. Sunspots appear dark in images because their temperature is lower than the rest of the photosphere. See also photosphere
Super-Earth
An extra-solar planet whose mass is greater than Earth’s but less than planets such as Uranus and Neptune. See also extra-solar planet.
Supergiant star
An exceptionally luminous star with a very large diameter.
Supernova
A violent explosion of a massive star, during which it expels most of its matter, and its brightness increases hugely for a short time. A different kind of supernova happens when a white dwarf explodes after attracting material from a neighboring star.
T
Trans-Neptunian object
A Solar System body orbiting the Sun beyond the orbit of Neptune.
U
Ultraviolet radiation
Electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths shorter than visible light but longer than X-rays. See also electromagnetic radiation
Universe
The totality of matter, energy, and space that came into being as a result of the Big Bang.
V
Variable star
A star that varies in brightness. A pulsating variable star physically expands and contracts in a regular rhythm, varying in brightness as it does so. An eruptive variable star brightens and fades abruptly. See also Cepheid variable, Mira variable, eclipsing binary
W
Wavelength
The distance between two successive crests in a wave motion.
White dwarf star
A small, but very hot and dense, glowing body that remains after a star of similar mass to our Sun dies and sheds its outer layers into space.
Wolf-Rayet star
A massive, very hot star from which gas is escaping at an exceptionally rapid rate.
X
X-ray
Electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths shorter than ultraviolet radiation but longer than gamma rays. See also electromagnetic radiation
Z
Zenith
The point in the sky directly above an observer.
Zodiac
An imaginary band around the celestial sphere, through which the Sun, Moon, and planets appear to travel. It represents the plane of the Solar System as seen from Earth. See also ecliptic
