Decipherment of Indus Script inscriptions (502) of Ahar, Balathal, Gilund, Rojdi as wealth accounting ledgers of mineral resources
This monograph demonstrates that many of the 'geometric designs' used on the inscriptions of the sites of Ahar, Balathal, Gilund and Rojdi relate to metalwork, and in particular, a hypothesis is posited that the mineral resources processed as ingots from these sites constitute a network of supply routes of mineral ingots to other sites such as Chanhudaro, Mohenjodaro, Harappa,Kalibangan, Dholavira, Lothal, with smithy/forge workshops and hence, deemed to be manufacturing hubs of the Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization.
Introduction
Thanks to Asko Parpola's team which has been consistent in their efforts to document inscriptions from Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization.
The latest publication (2019) is titled: Asko Parpola, BM Pande and Petteri Koskikallio eds., 2019, Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscriptions Volume 3: New material, untraced objects, and collections outside India and Pakistan, Part 2 Shahr-i-Sokhta, Mundigak, Mehrgarh, Nausharo, Sibri, Dauda-damb, Chanhu-daro; Ahar, Balathal, Gilund; Kalibangan; Rojdi, Helsinki, Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia (in collaboration with Massimo Vidale & Alessandra Lazzari;Catherine & Jean-Francois Jarrige, Gonzague Quivron & Helene Tromparent; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Marta Ameri; and Gregory L. Possehl.
The details of new material are as follows: Shahr-i Sokhta: SiS-1 to 184 184 Mundigak Mgk-1 to 62 62 Mehrgarh Mr-19 to 110 92 Nausharo Ns-11 to 88 78 Sibri Sb-4 to 10 7 Dauda-damb Da-1 1 Chanhu-daro C-51 to 120 70 Ahar Ahar-1 to 19 19 Balathal Btl 1-9 9 Gilund Gld-1 to 113 113 Kalibangan K-123 to 476 354 Rojdi Rjd-1 to 361 361
Total 1347 Note: Most of the Rojdi material are graffiti marks, and many of these marks cannot be



precisely identified in the context of the sign lists of Indus Script Corpora. However, some are very vivid Indus Scipt Inscriptions confirming the continuum of Indus Script Tradition during the period from 2000 BCE to 1700 BCE at Rojdi.

These four sites have access to the mineral ore resources of Khetri mines using the navigable waterway of Sarasvati River and other rivers such as Sabarmati and Mahi rivers of RajasthanGujarat (two areas which powered the Tin-Bronze Revolution from 4th m. BCE as evidenced by the provenance analyses of copper in artifacts of Ancient Near East. cf.

1. Geographical locations of sites of Mesopotamia from which artifacts were analyzed in this work (After Fig. 1 in Begemann, F. et al, 2009 loc.cit.) The conclusion is: "Unsere bleiisotopische evidenz legt nahe, das in Mesopotamien fur legierung mit zinn verwendete kupfer urudu-luh-ha stamme aus Indien, was ebenfalls vertraglich ist mit einem import via dilmun." (Trans. Our lead isotope evidence



suggests that the urudu-luh-ha copper used in Mesopotamia for tin alloying is from India, which is also contracted with an import via Dilmun.)" (opcit., p.28)



"There are three principal contributions of the Rojdi Project to our understanding of the Harappan Civilization generally and the Harappans in Saurashtra.. The long series of radiocarbon dates from the site has redefined the regional chronology. The large collection of palaeobotanical materials has given us our first insight into the ancient Saurashtran subsistence system, which was very different from that in Sindh and the Punjab, where Mohenjo-daro and Harappa are located. The collection has also played a role in the understanding of the integration of African millets into the ancient India agricultural system.. The final period of occupation at Rojdi took place from ca. 2000-1700 B.C., just as Mohenjo-daro and many other sites to the north were being abandoned which seems to tell us that the so-called "eclipse" of the Harappan Civilization was a much different process from the one generally presented in text books." -- Gregory Possehl Source: https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~gpossehl/rojdi.html
As Marta Ameri notes in reference to three inscriptions from Balathal: "Three of the four sealings (nos. 1108, 4809, and 5013) were found in the area of the large kiln uncovered in structure 8 in layers that date to the later part of the middle Chalcolithic period." This is a clear indication of the use of Indus Script to document products produced from kilns (furnaces). Terracotta artifacts of zebu bulls have also been found. The zebu signifies: प़ोळ pōḷa, 'zebu, bos indicus' signifies pōḷa 'magnetite, ferrite ore'.
मेढ 'Polar star' Rebus: mẽṛhẽt, meḍ 'iron' (Ho.Munda); medhā, 'yajña, dhanam'
kolom 'rice plant' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge'
ko ̤ru 'sprout' rebus: ko ̤ru 'bar of metal'
tāmarasa'lotus' rebus: tāmra'copper'.
I submit that the artifacts and inscriptions from the sites of Ahar, Balatha, Gilund, Rojdi and Chanhudaro are relatable to the so-called Copper Hoard culture with sites marked on the GangaYamuna doab as shown on the map.
Paul Yule has demonstrated that 'bar of metal' constituted a large ingot.



https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/the-copper-hoards-of-northern-india/ "In 1870, while tending cattle, two young boys in the village of Ghangaria in central India noticed a long metal object poking out of the ground. Grubbing at the spot revealed many more such pieces, and soon word of the find reached local officials. The discovery of this hoard, with over five hundred copper and silver antiquities weighing some 368 kilograms, added a new and tantalizing chapter to the little-known prehistory of India." Paul Yule has also recorded a bronze object found with Indus Script inscription in Chanhudaro (a smithy/forge workshop site close to the Khetri mines).

For e.g., the following 'geometric forms' are relatable to shapes of furnaces found in archaeological contexts and shapes of bun-ingots of copper found from many sites of the civilization.



The + shape of the Rojdi seal is comparable to the fire-altar, furnace found in Malhar on Ganga Basin. Thus, the 'geometric design' on the seal signifies a 'fire-altar, furnace'
At Rojdi have been found these two remarkable artifacts: 1. copper knife with an inscription of 'endless-knot' hieroglhyph of Indus Script; and 2. a potsherd with an inscription of four hieroglyphs of the script.
The decipherment of 'endless knot' hieroglyph: Abiding nature of this hieroglyph is seen on an epigraph of historical periods (Copper plate epigraph of Dhruva II). The endless knot motif signifies: meḍhi 'plait, twist' Rupaka, 'metaphor' or rebus reading: meḍ 'iron' (Mu.Ho.) med 'copper' (Slavic languages) मेधा धन Naigh. ii , 10; yajña.

Marta Ameri provides a precise account of the archaeological context of these Ahar-Banas inscriptions. She notes: "The sites that belong to the Ahar-Banas complex are located primarily in the Mewar region of southwestern Rajasthan, to the east of Aravalli mountain range, which runs from Gujarat to Delhi and bisects the state diagonally. They cluster around the Banas River and its tributaries, the Ahar, he Berach, the Gambiri, the Kothari and the Khari. The sites vary in size from a tiny 0.3 hectares (Tarawal) to a fairly subsgtantial 22 ha. (Gilund), but seem to cluster at around 5 hectares in size...The corpus of sealings found at Gilund is made up of 249 fragments of sealing clay, many of which had been impressed by stamp seals...The material found at Balathal included four sealings, one medium jar stopper, two objects that may have functioned as stamp seals, and one small stamp token. Three of the four sealings (nos. 1108,



4809, and 5013) were found in the area of the large kiln uncovered in structure 8 in layers that date to the later part of the middle Chalcolithic period...The two seals from Balathal are both stamps with a round face and a small handle...While no sealings or seal impressions were identified among the material from Ahar, there are at least nineteen objects, all made of terracotta, that may be classified as seals or seal amulets...A close examination of the context in which the seals and sealings were found, both at Gilund and at other Ahar-Banas sites, shows that these materials are part of a tradition that was in existence as early as the Middle AharBanas period (ca. 2500-2000 BCE) and continued until the end of the Late Ahar-Banas period (2000-1700 BCE)."
