Sagittarius A*
Sagittarius A* (pronounced "Sagittarius A-star", standard
abbreviation Sgr A*) is a bright and very compact astronomical radio
source at the center of the Milky Way, near the border of the
constellations Sagittarius and Scorpius. It is part of a larger
astronomical feature known as Sagittarius A. Sagittarius A* is
thought to be the location of a supermassive black hole,[6][7][8] like
those that are now generally accepted to be at the centers of most
spiral and elliptical galaxies. Observations of the star S2 in orbit
around Sagittarius A* have been used to show the presence of, and
produce data about, the Milky Way's central supermassive black
hole, and have led to the conclusion that Sagittarius A* is the site of
that black hole.[9]

Observation and descriptionEdit
Astronomers have been unable to observe Sgr A* in the optical
spectrum because of the effect of 25 magnitudes of extinction by
dust and gas between the source and Earth.[10] Several teams of
researchers have attempted to image Sagittarius A* in the radio
spectrum using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI).[11] The
current highest-resolution measurement, made at a wavelength of
1.3 mm, indicated an angular diameter for the source of 37 μas.[12] At
a distance of 26,000 light-years, this yields a diameter of 44 million
kilometers. For comparison, Earth is 150 million kilometers from the
Sun, and Mercury is 46 million kilometers from the Sun at perihelion.
The proper motion of Sgr A* is approximately −2.70 mas per year for



the right ascension and −5.6 mas per year for the declination.[13]
As of April 2017, there have been direct radio images taken of
Sagittarius A* with the Event Horizon Telescope, but the data is still
being processed, and images have yet to be released. The Event
Horizon Telescope uses interferometry to combine images taken
from widely spaced observatories at different places on Earth in
order to gain a higher picture resolution. It is hoped the
measurements will test Einstein's theory of relativity more rigorously
than has previously been done. If discrepancies between the theory
of relativity and actual observation are found, scientists may have
identified physical circumstances under which the theory breaks
down.[14]
HistoryEdit
Karl Jansky, considered a father of radio astronomy, discovered in
August 1931 that a radio signal was coming from a location at the
center of the Milky Way, in the direction of the constellation of
Sagittarius.[15] Sgr A* was discovered on February 13 and 15, 1974,
by astronomers Bruce Balick and Robert Brown using the baseline
interferometer of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.[16][17]
The name Sgr A* was coined by Brown in a 1982 paper because the
radio source was "exciting", and excited states of atoms are denoted
with asterisks.[18][19]
On October 16, 2002, an international team led by Reinhard Genzel
of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics reported the
observation of the motion of the star S2 near Sagittarius A* over a
period of ten years. According to the team's analysis, the data ruled
out the possibility that Sgr A* contains a cluster of dark stellar
objects or a mass of degenerate fermions, strengthening the
evidence for a massive black hole.[21] The observations of S2 used



near-infra red (NIR) interferometry (in the K-band, i.e. 2.2 μm)
because of reduced interstellar extinction in this band. SiO masers
were used to align NIR images with radio observations, as they can
be observed in both NIR and radio bands. The rapid motion of S2
(and other nearby stars) easily stood out against slower-moving
stars along the line-of-sight so these could be subtracted from the
images.
The VLBI radio observations of Sagittarius A* could also be aligned
centrally with the images so S2 could be seen to orbit Sagittarius A*.
From examining the Keplerian orbit of S2, they determined the mass
of Sagittarius A* to be 2.6 ± 0.2 million solar masses, confined in a
volume with a radius no more than 17 light-hours (120 AU).[23] Later
observations of the star S14 showed the mass of the object to be
about 4.1 million solar masses within a volume with radius no larger
than 6.25 light-hours (45 AU) or about 6.7 billion kilometres.[3] They
also determined the distance from Earth to the Galactic Center (the
rotational center of the Milky Way), which is important in calibrating
astronomical distance scales, as 8.0 ± 0.6 × 103 parsecs. In
November 2004 a team of astronomers reported the discovery of a
potential intermediate-mass black hole, referred to as GCIRS 13E,
orbiting three light-years from Sagittarius A*. This black hole of 1,300
solar masses is within a cluster of seven stars. This observation may
add support to the idea that supermassive black holes grow by
absorbing nearby smaller black holes and stars.
After monitoring stellar orbits around Sagittarius A* for 16 years,
Gillessen et al. estimate the object's mass at 4.31 ± 0.38 million solar
masses. The result was announced in 2008 and published in The
Astrophysical Journal in 2009.[2] Reinhard Genzel, team leader of the
research, said the study has delivered "what is now considered to be
the best empirical evidence that super-massive black holes do really
exist. The stellar orbits in the Galactic Center show that the central



mass concentration of four million solar masses must be a black
hole, beyond any reasonable doubt."[24]
On January 5, 2015, NASA reported observing an X-ray flare 400
times brighter than usual, a record-breaker, from Sgr A*. The unusual
event may have been caused by the breaking apart of an asteroid
falling into the black hole or by the entanglement of magnetic field
lines within gas flowing into Sgr A*, according to astronomers.[20]
Central black holeEdit



Inferred orbits of 6 stars around supermassive black hole candidate Sagittarius A* at the Milky Way's center.[25]
According to present data it
seems that the Sagittarius
A* radio emissions are not
centered on the hole but
arise from a bright spot in
the region around the black
hole, close to the event
horizon, possibly in the
accretion disc or a
relativistic jet of material
ejected from the disc.[12] If
the apparent position of
Sagittarius A* were exactly
centered on the black hole,
it would be possible to see it
magnified beyond its actual
size, because of gravitational lensing. According to general relativity,
this would result in a minimum observed size of at least 5.2 times the
black hole's Schwarzschild radius, which, for a black hole of around
4 million solar masses, corresponds to a minimum observed size of
approximately 52 μas which is much larger than the observed size of
37 μas.[12]
The mass of Sagittarius A* has been estimated in two different ways.
1. Two groups—in Germany and the U.S.—monitored the orbits of
individual stars very near to the black hole and used Kepler's
laws to infer the enclosed mass. The German group found a
mass of 4.31 ± 0.38 million solar masses,[2] whereas the
American group found 3.7 ± 0.2 million solar masses.[3] Given
that this mass is confined inside a 44 million km diameter
sphere, this yields a density ten times higher than previous
estimates.



2. More recently, measurement of the proper motions of a sample
of several thousand stars within approximately one parsec from
the black hole, combined with a statistical technique, has
yielded both an estimate of the black hole's mass at 3.6+0.2
−0.4×106 M䡨, plus a distributed mass in the central parsec
amounting to (1±0.5)×106 M䡨.[26] The latter is thought to be
composed of stars and stellar remnants.
Astronomers are confident that these observations of Sagittarius A*
provide good empirical evidence that the Milky Way has a
supermassive black hole at its center, 26,000 light-years from the
Solar System[9] because:
The star S2 follows an elliptical orbit with a period of 15.2
years and a pericenter (closest distance) of 17 light hours
(1.8×1013 m) from the center of the central object.[27]
From the motion of star S2, the object's mass can be
estimated as 4.1 million solar masses.[3] (The
corresponding Schwarzschild radius is
0.08 AU/12 million km/7.4 million miles; 17 times bigger than
the radius of the Sun.)
The volume of the central object can be further
constrained by the orbit of star S0-16 (also known as S14),
which came within 45 AU without colliding.
Estimates of mass and diameter are now constrained
primarily by uncertainties in distance to the objects.
Although strictly speaking there are other mass configurations that
would explain the measured mass and size, such an arrangement
would collapse into a single supermassive black hole on a timescale
much shorter than the age of the Milky Way.[12]
The comparatively small mass of this black hole, along with the low



luminosity of the radio and infrared emission lines, imply that the
Milky Way is not a Seyfert galaxy.[10]
Ultimately, what is seen is not the black hole itself, but observations
that are consistent only if there is a black hole present near Sgr A*. In
the case of such a black hole, the observed radio and infrared
energy emanates from gas and dust heated to millions of degrees
while falling into the black hole. Although other possibilities exist for
how these gases emanate energy, such as radiation pressure and
interaction with other gas streams, interaction with a massive source
of gravity is the simplest explanation.[28] The black hole itself is
thought to emit only Hawking radiation at a negligible temperature,
on the order of 10−14 kelvin.

The European Space Agency's gamma-ray observatory INTEGRAL



has observed gamma rays interacting with the nearby giant
molecular cloud Sagittarius B2, causing X-ray emission from the
cloud. This energy was emitted about 350 years earlier by Sgr A*,
possibly detectable from Earth around the year 1650.[citation needed]
The total luminosity from this outburst (L≈1,5×1039 erg/s) is
estimated to be a million times stronger than the current output from
Sgr A* and is comparable with a typical active galactic nucleus.[32]
[33] In 2011 this conclusion was supported by Japanese astronomers
observing the Milky Way's center with the Suzaku satellite.[34]
Discovery of G2 gas cloud on an accretion courseEdit
First noticed as something unusual in images of the center of the
Milky Way in 2002,[35] the gas cloud G2, which has a mass about
three times that of Earth, was confirmed to be likely on a course
taking it into the accretion zone of Sgr A* in a paper published in
Nature in 2012.[36] Predictions of its orbit suggested it would make
its closest approach to the black hole (a perinigricon) in early 2014,
when the cloud was at a distance of just over 3000 times the radius
of the event horizon (or ≈260 AU, 36 light-hours) from the black
hole. G2 has been observed to be disrupting since 2009,[36] and was
predicted by some to be completely destroyed by the encounter,
which could have led to a significant brightening of X-ray and other
emission from the black hole. Other astronomers suggested the gas
cloud could be hiding a dim star, or a binary star merger product,
which would hold it together against the tidal forces of Sgr A*,
allowing the ensemble to pass by without any effect.[37] In addition
to the tidal effects on the cloud itself, it was proposed in May
2013[38] that, prior to its perinigricon, G2 might experience multiple
close encounters with members of the black-hole and neutron-star
populations thought to orbit near the Galactic Center, offering some
insight into the region surrounding the supermassive black hole at
the center of the Milky Way.[39]



The average rate of accretion onto Sgr A* is unusually small for a
black hole of its mass[40] and is only detectable because it is so
close to Earth. It was thought that the passage of G2 in 2013 might
offer astronomers the chance to learn much more about how
material accretes onto supermassive black holes. Several
astronomical facilities observed this closest approach, with
observations confirmed with Chandra, XMM, EVLA, INTEGRAL,
Swift, Fermi and requested at VLT and Keck.[41]
Simulations of the passage were made before it happened by groups
at ESO[42] and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).[43]
As the cloud approached the black hole, Dr. Daryl Haggard said "It's
exciting to have something that feels more like an experiment", and
hoped that the interaction would produce effects that would provide
new information and insights.[44]
Nothing was observed during and after the closest approach of the
cloud to the black hole, which was described as a lack of "fireworks"
and a "flop".[45] Astronomers from the UCLA Galactic Center Group
published observations obtained on March 19 and 20, 2014,
concluding that G2 was still intact (in contrast to predictions for a
simple gas cloud hypothesis) and that the cloud was likely to have a
central star.[46]
An analysis published on 21 July 2014 based on observations by the
ESO's Very Large Telescope in Chile concluded alternatively that the
cloud, rather than being isolated, might be a dense clump within a
continuous but thinner stream of matter, and would act as a constant
breeze on the disk of matter orbiting the black hole, rather than
sudden gusts that would have caused high brightness as they hit, as
originally expected. Supporting this hypothesis, G1, a cloud that
passed near the black hole 13 years ago, had an orbit almost

identical to G2, consistent with both clouds, and a gas tail thought to
be trailing G2, all being denser clumps within a large single gas
stream.[45][47]
Professor Andrea Ghez et al. suggested in 2014 that G2 is not a gas
cloud but rather a pair of binary stars that had been orbiting the
black hole in tandem and merged into an extremely large star.[37][48]
Sgr A* is monitored on a daily basis by the X-ray telescope of the
Swift satellite.
