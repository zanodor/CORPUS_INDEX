PREFACE.
The so-called Dumuzi or Tamuz texts must be divided into two classes: 1) those in which Ishtar and her maidens bewail the "absent" or "dead" Dunluzi and 2 ) those which celebrate Dumuzi's resurrection or wedding. Several specimens of the latter class may be found among the tablets of the Nippur Temple Library. One of them is published and translated in the "Hilprecht Anniversary Volume", p. 391, no. 2, while its larger duplicate text, C. B. M. 11391, is given in photographic reproduction, I. c., pl. IV, no. 7. To the former class belong the tablets here published. Though scholars are aocustomed to speak of this class of tablets as "Dumuzi texts", such a designation is evidently inadequate. Henceforth they must be described as "Sumerian lenten songs", and this for the simple reason that they formed part of a great temple ritual, which was recited by Ishtar and her maidens during the "month of wailings", L Ululu. Seeing, furthermore, that at the time of the kings of the 11dynasty of Ur and of the I dynasty of Isin, when the bulk of the tablets of Temple Library was written, this month corresponded to our February-March, and that these wailings culminated in a festival of joy, which celebrated the happy "reuniting of Dumuzi and Ishtar", and which was observed at the time of the vernal equinox, it is not a t all difficult to see in the Sumerian season of wailing the prototype of our Christian lenten season and in the union of Dumuzi and Ishtar the reuniting of Christ with the rrvei$~,clol,whose sphere of influence is the "Church", the "Bride of the Lamb", and this the more so as Dumuzi himself was, according to Sumerian conception, the "Lanib (sherba) of God (Alz)" while Ishtar was his "Bride". Strange indeed and most remarkable are the parallels between the Sumerian and Christian Lenten and Easter festivals: Dumuzi goes to the "north" or "netherworld", i.e, he "dies", in order to conquer the "enemy from the north", the cold, winter, darkness. Christ dies in order to conquer Satan, the "prince of darkness". Dumuzi while in the netherworld is "bewailed" by his "Bride" Ishtar, especially during the month February-March (Ululu);but this is exactly the season of the Christian lent, during which the church, the "Bride of the Lamb", mourns over the death of her "bridegroom", Christ. The month Ululu is followed immediately by the "month of the festival of Dumuzi" which begins wlth the vernal equinox and which celebrates, among other things, Dumuzi's marriage with "Mother Earth", the resurrection of nature and the beginning of new life.

Vlll PREFACE.
The Christian lenten season is terminated by the Easter festival, celebrating a t the time of the vernal equinox the resurrection of Christ and the beginning of a new, spiritual life (~wonotr,8~Jiis 7q nvtdpa~t,I St. Peter, I11 : 18) of Christ and of his Church, thus demonstrating, corroborating and proving the truthfulness and correctness of the Sumerian resurrection festival, for "if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised" or again, "if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ been raised" (I.Cor. XT7: 12ff.). The Christian lenten and resurrection festivals are in this wise by no means merely a "rehash" of Babylonian ideas. This would be misunderstanding the divine will as carried out in history. No, no, not a "rehash", but the very culmination and "fulfillment" of the wisdom of ages past are the Christian lenten and resurrection festivals. The "truth" which the Sumerians dimly recognized while still groping in the dark receives by the death and resurrection of Christ its true light, explanation, seal, approval and spiritual significance. Christ and the Christian religion not only is, but must and, I am sure, will be recognized, more and more, to be what we are told it is: the nk?jQmcln. In thus admitting, on the one hand, the exact parallels between the Sumerian and the Christian lent and resurrection, and on the other recognizing in the Christian festivals the nh?jaw,uaof their predecessors among the Sumerians, we will not stand in any danger of losing our faith - on the contrary, the Christian religion will become for us a living reality, che last link in the long chain of divine revelations uniting us with the past and into a common brotherhood of man, believing the same thing and hoping for the same thing: our own resurrection. Let us, therefore, be true to ourselves and recognize the divine element even in the Sumerian religion, at the same time let us not forget that grand and sublime though the Sumerian religion may be, it is but a faint shadow of the light that shines in Christ. This "declaration of faith" I am constrained to make publicly here in response to several communications and criticisms from certain quarters requesting me to state frankly and honestly nly position and personal belief with regard to the Sumerian religion in its relation to that of the Christians. When writing these pages, it was my main desire, within the space (about 60 pages) at my disposal, to show that the so-called Dumuzi-Ishtar myth is not confined to one god or goddess, but that each and every "Son" and "Mother" of a given Sumerian trinity was the Dumuzi and Ishtar. This necessitated my pointing out, whenever desirable or possible, the analogies and parallels, the common names, attributes and functions to be found in connection with the various ,,Sonsc'and ,,Mothersc'. In this wise the student will be put, it is hoped, into a position to judge for himself how the Sumerian religion originated and developed, how certain doctrines were transferred from one "Son" of a given trinity to

another, and how, lastly, even the "Westland", Canaan, knew of the Dumuzi-Ishtar myth as early as the time of the kings of the I1 dynasty of Ur, about 2500 B. C. This observation furnishes also the connecting link between the Sumerian Dumuzi and the Egyptian, Phoenician, Greek and Latin Osiris, Esmun, Adonis, and last, but not least, the Christian doctrine of the death and resurrection of Christ. Nowhere I felt the absence of detailed special investigations as much as in the Sumerian Dumuzi-Ishtar myth, which lies at the very foundation and without which an accurate understanding of the later Osiris and Adonis myth is evidently impossible. This is especially true with regard t o the time of the wailings for Dumuzi or the "Sumerian lenten festival". Upon the suggestion of the Editor, Professor H. V. Hilprecht, I made bold to issue my researches on this very moot and greatly disputed question in a special volume of Series D. In doing so, it is my fond hope that this investigation will evoke the liveliest discussion and criticism by all those scholars who take an interest in such matters -be they Oriental, Classical or theological scholars. It is, of course, well known and need hardly be reiterated here, that these pages would never have seen the light of day, were it not for the continued graciousness and liberality of my benefactress Mrs. Sallie Crozer Hilprecht. To her are due the homage and
gratefulness which rightly belongs to a true patroness of the science of Sumeriology. May these pages convince her once more of my lasting, though humble, indebtedness. With special sentiments of gratitude and admiration I think also of the continued help and encouragement given me by Professor H. V. Hilprecht. His are truly heroic deeds and sacrifices for the sake of science. May he see his ambition realized and crowned with that reward which rightly belongs to him and which, I am proud to say, all true scholars wish him. Also to Professor Heinrich Zimmern of Leipzig my sincere gratefulness is due for his kind-' ness in reading the last proofs of this book and in putting at my disposal the advance sheets of his in every respect most admirable "rSumerische Kultlieder". I did not know how to show my appreciation of his kindness better than bp constantly quoting from his new book. Happy, extremely happy, I am to be permitted to inscribe this volume to our former President and Chairman of the Babylonian Department of the University of Pennsylvania, Samuel I?. Houston, Esq., in grateful remembrance of his most cordial hospitality, material help and never failing encouragement continuously bestowed upon me.

INTRODUCTION.
There is no myth in any of the known religions which, as regards its importance, can be compared with the so-called Dumuzi-Ninanna myth of the early Sumerians. I n it are rooted not only the later conceptions which the Egyptians, Phoenioians, Greeks and Latins entertained with regard to the death and resurrection of their Osiris, Esmun, Adonis, but and this we may now confidently assert - i t forms also the prototype of our Christian Lenten season and of the death and resurrection of Christ. It explains why the Lenten season terminates the winter, the time of darkness and death, and why it precedes the Easter festival which celebrates the resurrection of nature and of Christ. I n order to understand, from this point of view, the Dumuzi-Ninanna myth more accurately and thus be put into a position to appreciate its later developments more thoroughly, I shall try to give here in mere outlines its essential features, leaving its details and later accretions for future discussion^.^ The religion of the Sumerians, together with their conception of the macro-cosmos, is but a reflex of their human institutions as given on hand by their micro-cosmos or kalam, in which they lived. As this kalam or "Babylonia" proper developed, so the "world" was thought to have developed. This gives us the maxims: Human society = divine society; micro-cosmos or the kalam of the Sumerians = macro-cosmos or world. The kalam, originally one wl~ole,presided over by god An, the "king of the kalam", very soon came to be looked upon, a t a period which is still pre-historic for us, as consisting of two parts: a "northern" or "lower" and a "southern" or "upper" part. The latter was represented by the city of Erech with the temple of An: &-an; the former by the city of Nippur with the temple of Elzlil: &-7cur.
At an other and later period the south was centered in the city of Bridu with the north in A-HA or HA-A, i.e., in "northern Mesopotamia".
At still other times the north was either the city of Girsu or Kutha or Akkad or the Armenian mountains or the so-called "Westla~zd" or even Elam. At the time of the kings of the I1 dynasty of Ur - the time from which a large portion of the Nippur Temple
For a detailed investigation of the "Time of the Sumerian Lenten or Dumud Festival" see B. E., Series D, vol. VI. If time permits, I hope to follow this up with a disoussion of the "Migration of the Dumuzi-Ninanna myth", beginning with the Ereoh trinity and ending with that of the "Westland", from whence i t penetrated to the Egyptians, l'hoenioians, Greeks and Latins. 1

Library dates -Babylonia as a whole was designated by Ki-en-gi-ki-Uri (= BUR-BUR) which the Semites translated by "Shumer and Akkad", the former being the '<southern" or "upper" and the latter the "northern" or "lower" part - a designation clearly showing that the physical condition of Babylonia played absolutely no r61e whatever in the selection of these names, or else the northern mountaineous regions of Babylonia as, e. g., the Armenian mountains, Elam, the Westland, would much rather have deserved the name "highland" or "upper" part of Babylonia. The "southern" part was the region of the "Father" and the "northwn" that of the "Son"; and as the "nmth" was also the "great abode" (iri-gal) of the Babylonian gods, was, in fact, the "netherworld", the "Son" came to be looked upon as the "lord of the netherworld". The first and oldest "lord of the netherworld" was Enlil. The displacing of An by Enlil necessitated, of course, a shifting of the "southern" center from Erech to Nippur, i.e., Nippur , during the Enlil period, became what Erech was during that of An: the "southern" or "upper" part of Babylonia, with Girsu or Kutha, etc. as the "northern" or "lower" part. Hence, the gods of Girsu (dNin-Girsu),Kutha (dNergal),etc. had necessanly to become not only the "Sons" of Enlil, but also and especially the "lords of the netherworld". Similar to the micro-cosmos was the development of the Babylonian macro-cosmos,
which, though it originally formed but one whole (the An), was later on made to conform
"
with its micro-cosmic pattern, becoming an an-ki, a heaven" or "upper" and an "earth" or "lower" part. But the Sumerians were apparently not satisfied with this, they subdivided the "heaven" as well as the "earth" into two other parts: the "upper" or "southern" heaven, i.e., the heaven as it appears during the "summer" half of the year, and the C' lower" or "northern" heaven, i. e., the heaven as it appears during the "winter" half of the year. This latter division applied to the "earth" gives us the "upper" earth as it appears to man, or the "earth" in opposition to the "heaven", and the "lower" earth or "netherworld". Even the very "netherworld" seems to have been subdivided into an "upper" and a "lower" netherworld: a n - d i n k i - d i n .
At a still later time the boundaries of Babylonia were so far extended as to include not only the Euphrates and the Tigris, but even the "sea of the going down of the sun" and the "sea of the rising of the sun", in other words, the kalarn at this time was a "world" which was on all sides surrounded by water. Also this conception was transferred to both the macro-cosmos with its "heavenly" and "terrestrial" ocean and to the netherworld with its SaEan, which was a river consisting, like the Euphrates and Tigris, of two arms, one in the west and one in the east. When entering or leaving the netherworld this Suban had to be crossed, becoming in this wise the prototype of the later "Styx" among the Greeks. The conveyance in ships of the Babylonian gods from one temple to the

other, at the time of the Sumerian Akiti of "New Year's" festival, i.e., at the time, of the vernal equinox, is nothing but a symbolic action indicating that the gods have crossed the Saban and, by doing so, have left the netherworld, the region of the north, the cold, the winter -a conception revealed in the heavens by the sun crossing the muruban or equator.
Another division of the Babylonian macro- and micro-cosmos, of the heavens and the netherworld is into "seven parts", which seven parts were again modeled after the "sevel~UB" or "DA", i.e., "compartments, divisions, spheres" of Erech.
The god of the Babylonian kalam was An of Erech, "the god of the totality of heaven and earth". At some as yet undefined period of the Sumerian religion An was differen
tiated into a husband and wife: An + An - a differentiation still betraying the fact that the wife of a god shared with her husband the same name, functions, attributes, and even gender. The wife of An, therefore, was not only the "queen" or "goddess of the totality of heaven and earth", but also the "lord of heaven and the mistress of earth", as is apparent from Zimmern, S.K., p. 32, no. 28: 7a, where 'Innanna, i. e., 'Ninanna, the wife of An, speaks of herself: an-na zi-mu-un-bime-en ki-a ga-sha-an-bime-en, "of the heaven his lord I am; of the earth her lady I am", a passage showing that Ishtar and for that matter any other god or goddess - is both male and female, and that the "heaven" and the "earth", the two parts of the Babylonian macro-cosmos, stand in the relation of "male" and "female", or "husband" (umun = en) and "wife" (gashan= nin), thus forming the prototype of the Greek o 6 ~ a i / b sxai yaia.l Cf. also M. V. A. G., 1908, p. 220129, where Gashan-anna tells us that she has received into her hands the &-an-na E-ki-a, "the house of heaven and earth", identifying herself (1. 22) with Enlil and Ninlil, the "lord" and "lady" of heaven and earth during the Enlil period of the Sumerian religion.
This "heaven" and "earth": an + an, or an + ki, or differentiated into En (Umun)
an + Nin (Gashan)-anand translated into Semitic by An-urn - An-turn were the first divine pair, the first "father-mother" (ama-a-a)or parents, the begetters and creators of everything. They had a "Son" (dnmu):the god Lil, later on differentiated into En-lil and Nin-lil, the well-known gods of Nippur. This son was the original, only and "true son" (Dumu-zi)-thus called to distinguish him from the later sons of An who usurped the r6le of Enlil, such as dZM,dMAR-TU,d E n - z ~et,c. Enlil was, as his name indicates, the "god of the powers of nature", i.e., of thunder, lightning, storm, clouds, rain, and thus necessarily the "god of the fertility of the ground". An, the heaven, as "Father", Enlil, the god of the powers of nature, as "Son", and Nin (Gashan)-a*, the earth, as "Mother", constitute the members of the f i s t and oldest trinity in the religion of the

4 SUMERIAN HYMNS AND PRAYERS TO DUMU-ZZ
Sumerians -a trinity, without which an accurate understanding of the so-called DumuziNinanna myth is evidently impossible. The origin of this myth is to be sought in the city of Erech ( I r i k i ) , signifying in Sumerian merely "city", "abode". Here was the temple of An, called &-an, which was the "sphere of influence" of both An and N i n (Gashan)-an, the latter being, thereforc, very often called N i n ashan an)-A-anna, "the mistress of the house of An". This name, together with that of N i n (Gashan)-anna, are the two foremost ones, in the texts here published, by which the later Ishtar is known. The significance of, this myth does not offer any difficulties, provided we accept thc above offered explanation with regard to Dumu-zi, "the true 'Son' ", as the god of the "powers of nature", and Gashan-an, the "Mother", as the goddess of the "earth". The Dumuzi-Ninanna myth, then, treats of the relation of the "Mother", or "earth", to the "Son", as the god of the "fertility of the ground". This Nin-anna appears in our texts soon as "virgin" (ki-el), and soon as "mother" ( a m a ) , "sister" (SAL-KU = ahat),' or "bride" ( d a m ) of Dumuzi, while the latter is termed either the "youthful one" kal-tur), or ,,brothern (ses), "son" (dumu), and "husband" (mu-tan-na) of Nin-a,nna. These very names, it would seem, should suffice for a correct understanding of this myth. Nin-anna is the "Mother", because she bore, as the wife of An, Dumuzi. But she is, or may become, the "wife" also of her own beloved "Son", i.e., she as "earth" enters every year, at the time of the early spring, into wedlock with the god of "rain" or of tho "fertility of the ground", in consequence of which she becomes pregnant and produces the "vegetation" or the "new life of nature". This production of the new life of nature is described partly as a "resurrection" and partly as a "giving of birth". Though the actual wedlock took place in the "netherworld", i.e., in the "north" where there is the "mountain of the gods", it was celebrated or re-enacted upon "earth" in the various temples, and revealed in the "heavens". Up to the time of the vernal equinox Nin-anna was a "virgin", appearing in the heavens as "virgo"; with the occurrence of the equinox this virgin becomes the "Mother", the "creatrix and bearer of everything", revealing herself in the heavens as the "sublime lady" ( W i n - m a h ) , who holds a "babe" in her arms which she nourishes. Who or what this babe is, is not difficult to explain: it is the personified vegetation (spica), the new-born creation, the "resurrected" and hence "new-born god of vegetation". No wonder, then, that before the IV century A. D., some Christian sects believed that Christ was born at the end of March, and that, though this belief was later on discarded in favor of the 26. of December, the Christian Church saw fit to compromise on this question by naming the first sunday after Easter quasi mod0 geniti, "like the new-born babes".
Cf. the gloss a-Bat in C. T., XXIV.11: 40 (see also 24: 56); XXV, 24a: 10 = 24h, 11: 19.



FROM THE TEMPLE LIBRARY OF NIPPUR. 5
The two-fold idea of Nin-anna's being a "virgin" and "mother" we still find in our modern "virgin soil" and "mother earth". The remaining peculiarity according to which Nin-anna was also the "sister" of Dumuzi, is due mainly to the fact that the Sumerians considered the husband and wife to be "one". Prom this it follows that Nin-anna had to become, as "bride" of Dumuzi, the "daughter" of An, just as Dumuzi himself was the "son" of An. Dumuzi and Ninanna, then, as husband and wife, are the "son" and "daughter" of An, and hence "brother" and "sister". Later on, when the myth of Dnmuzi and Nin-anna was transferred to the "Son" and "Mother" of the various other Sumerian trinities, it came to pass that Nin-anna or Ishtar as well as Dumuzi or Tamuz were looked upon as the "son" and "daughter" of each and every god who happened to play, in a particular city, the r61e of the "Father". This is the reason for the various and manifold genealogies of both Ishtar and Tamuz which make them the "daughter" and "son" of An, Enlil, Enzu, Enki (ahzu), Ningishzida, etc., etc., and for their being identified with practically each and every "Mother" and "Son" of the Sumerian trinities. The above mentioned wedlock of Dumuzi and Nin-anna is, however, only one of, the two relations in which they stand. The texts published in this volume do not refer t)othis marriage at all. On the contrary, we find that the "mother", "bride" and "sister" of Dumuzi is pictured in them as being on her way to or through the "netherworld" in search for her "beloved", who is described as being "dead", having taken up his abode in the Sumerian hades -a locality or state referred to by extremely interesting and highly descriptive names. While on her way to the "abode of Dumuzi", Nin-anna passes the socalled "street full of wailing" (sil a-si-ga)continually crying out a, or a-a, or &-a,or wa-wa, i. e., "alas", or "how long still", or "when a t last", sc., "shall I be joined to my beloved?" Numerous and difficult are the obstacles which Nin-anna has to overcome until she a t last is permitted to find her "beloved", with whom she enters the "bridal chamber". The meaning of this episode in the myth is plain. Dumuzi, the god of the "fertility of the ground", is "dead" (dig) or "powerless" (&-kt)during the winter, at which time he was thought to have descended into the netherworld, situated in the north. The necessary consequence of this impotency on the part of the "god of the fertility of the ground" was the barrenness of the earth or mother. The earth is barren during the winter season and, as the winter corresponds to the north, Nin

anna likewise is said to be in the w t h , where there is the netherworld, hoping, longing and praying to be united with her "beloved" in holy wedlock and thus be able to produce the new verdure, the new life of nature. These observations alone would justify us in maintaining that the so-called "wailings



6 SUMERIAN HYMNS AND PRAYERS TO D U M U - Z I
of Nin-anna for Dumuzi", which are the subject of the tablets here published, must have taken place some time during the winter season. Elsewhere I have shown that the fith month of a year beginning with the autumnal equinox was the month of the "wailings for Dumuzi". This 6" month corresponded to our Febmcary-March and was called Ululu, from which we have the Greek u'iod-vl;w and the Latin ulul-are -terms frequently used in connection with the wailings of Aphrodite for Adonis. Now, as the resurrection of Dumuzi falls at the time of the vernal equinox, and as the wailings for Dumuzi take place in the month immediately preceding it, we may confidently assert, that these two features of the Dumuzi-Ninanna myth constitute the prototype of the Christian Lenten and Resurrection festivals. Both have for their basis the annual barrenness of nature and its resurrection to new life, and both are nature and spring festivals. But each and every festival, though primarily given on hand by the immutable laws of nature, was a t one time or another connected with actual, historical facts. The Christian lenten and resurrection festivals were connected with the actual and historical death and resurrection of Christ. The same is true of the Sumerian lenten and resurrection festivals. Again and again Nin-anna complains about the "enemies" and "dogs" who have invaded Babylonia, defiled and destroyed its cities and temples, asking and praying that these her cities and temples "be again restored". Thanks to the tablets of the Nippur Library, we know now who these "enemies" and "dogs" were and whence they came. They were the "hords" from the north of Babylonia: the Guti, Lulubi, Elamites etc., etc. The macro-cosmic barrenness of the earth during the winter corresponds exactly to the destruction of Babylonia as micro-cosmos-a destruction which is wrought by the people from the north, the region of the winter and of the netherworld. To overcome this enemy, Dumuzi, like the later Nin-ib of the Nippur trinity, has to go to the north and smite this foe of Babylonia. And he does. As soon as this northern enemy is overcome, the rebuilding and dedication of the Babylonian cities and temples may and does take place. The destruction of the temples and cities represents the historical micro-cosmic lent; the dedication. of the temples the historical micro-cosmic resurrection, while the "wailings" of Nin-anna, from this point of view, are nothing but the appeal of her "lamentation men" and "women" to the generosity and liberality of the Babylonian kings and faithful ones to open their purses and make a most liberal offering a t "Easter (1shtar)time". This having been complied with, t,he gods, more particularly the "Son" and "Bride", can again take up their abode in the restored and dedicated temples, be re-united, and enter into holy wedlock. This conception, it is needless to say, introduced into the Dumuzi-Ninanna myth quite a new feature: - a fight between the "enemy from the north" and the "god of the

powers of nature". And seeing that the north was also the region of the netherworld, this fight of Dnmuzi acquired very soon a mythological significance -it was looked upon as a fight between the "powers of nature" and the "powers of darkness" (IJllmbaba):the winter, the cold, mythologically pictured as a serpent (sa&an). I t became a fight between the winter and spring, between darkness and light, between death and life - a fight such as took place not only at the "beginning of the world", when Marduk overcame Tiamat, or when Jahveh conquered Rahab-Liviathan, but a fight which is repeated every year, month (Enzu as Dumuzi) and day (Utu as Dumuzi) until the end of the world. The outcome of this fight is well-known: the enemy from the north as well as the mythological foe is overcome; Dumuzi the god of the powers of nature remains victorious. Also this victory is revealed in the heavens by the appearance, at the time of the Sumerian resurrection festival, i. e., at the time of the vernal equinox, of the star En-te-naMASH ( B A R ) - s ~ G ( L u M )i,nforming the faithful upon earth that now the dragon, the winter, the cold (en-te-nu)has been conquered, that its rulership has come to an end and that, in consequence of this victory, the new life, the new creation, the resurrection has not only been made possible but has become an actual fact. Dumuzi having overcome the foes of Babylonia - both historical and mythological receives as a reward the power to "judge" the universe, its living and its dead. The vernal equinox with the sign libra tells us that this his judgment is one of absolute justice and equity: it is as evenly balanced as is the day and night as this time.

This tablet contained originally several songs of Nin-anna, the "mother", "sister" and "bride" of Dumuzi. In the first song Nin-anna complains and bewails the destruction of her various and well-known cities and temples. Only one of the names of the cities is preserved, viz., Nippur, col. I : 16. The h u - m u , "my city", 1. 15, is herel in all probability Erech, "the city" par excellence and seat of the oldest Sumerian or pre-historic2trinity: An - Enlil Nin-an.
The following names of temples are still visible: DUR-AN-KI and &-DUR-AN-KI, col. I :16, 18, "(house of) the band3 of heaven (and earth)". B'or &-Dur-an(-ki or n u ) , the temple (ksh) and ziggurrat of Nippur, see "B61, the Christ", p. 21; H. A. V., p. 413, 3; Hilprecht, "Excavations in Bible Lands", p. 462; Zimmern, S.

T., XXIV, 39 :4; 22 :104. dDuran (-ki, .nu) was the father (a-li-du-ush)of dNNinn-na, i. e., of Ishtar as 'Nin-gal and wife of dEn-zu,K. 9955 +Rm. 613 (Bezold, "Cat." 1053); of dNd-iri-gal=Nergal, H. A. V., p. 428; and of dPA-KU = Nnsku, K . 3285 (Bezold, "Cat." 520, where, however, Gk-an-ki is a mistake for Dur-an-ki). This name, though originally belonging to Enlil as "Son"
Just as $-an, during the Enlil period of the Sumerian roligion, became the name of the temple of Nippur (g-kur),so did dru come to signify Nippur: of. H. A.

Even the "Son" of the En-zu trinity at Ur, 'Utu, acquired the title "band of heaven and earth" as is apparent from I1 R., 50 : 19 a, where the ziggurrat of Shamash at Larsa is called &-~ur-am-ki.

I n Semitic translations E-an-na is rendered by &-A-A-AG'- a name, the meanning of which is not yet apparent. I n B.

it is mentioned that the ziggurrat of Erech had the name &-ga-bar-7,while Erech itself was called G~-par-7". Cf. here also the 7-ga (an abbreviation of 7-ga-bar?)in connection with the temple d-an-nu, mentioned above, p. 9. Bur-Sin, king of Ur, built a 9%-barfor dNanna-Karzidaat Ur,' which in B. E., XXVII, no. I , I11 :47, is termed bh-Gc-bur-zu el-e gar-ra, "thy house, the g., beautifully built". Also Libit-Ishtar, king of Isin, erected an d-gii-bar,2 but i t is not evident where and for whom. Entemena3 and U r ~ k a g i n a ,p~atesis of Lagash, built an &.qi(sh)-ph-rafor NinGirsu a t Lagash. The "lord (umun) of the &-9%-pcir",i. e., D u m u ~ i ,is~ mentioned in R. H., p. 120 : 12. According t o A 0 2539, dInnanna was called nin Gcbar-ra-ye, "the mistress of the g." In no. 9, I1 :21, there appears as Ga-sha-anGa-bar-ra a goddes [..]-ha,
- a name, which in all probability was originally [dNin-tin-dib]-ba,7though the space seems rather small for such an emendation. From the fact, lastly, that gi-par-r[u] forms one
groups with gi-gu-nu-u, "y&radise, beautiful place, bridal chamber", and 7ci-is-gu = m, i. e., "the house where one passes the 'night"', hence a syn. of bzt ekliti, "house of darkness", the habitation of dIrkalla, it becomes evident that the gipar is not only a "chamber", but more particularly a "chamber" in which Ishtar and Dumuzi pass the "(wedding)night"; and as "7" has also the meaning kishshatu, "totality", the G%-bur-7-an-naor the Gz-ba-ri-na-milnuhad most likely the significance "bridal chamber of the tot,ality (whole) of the universe", i. e., the bridal chamber par ezcellence - surely, a most becoming name for the bridal chamber of Erech, the seat of the Sumerian religion. That this name, like E-an, should later on have been transferred to the bridal chamber of other cities, is only natural and in keeping with the development of the Sumerian religion. For other occurrences, in ancient Sumerian texts, see Zimmern, S.K., p. 13, no. 8, I1 :41, GE-blir-rn; p; 17, no. 12, I1 :9, p. 26, no. 26, IV : 10, 11, ga-bar; p. 27, no. 26, I1 :9, 10, ma-6%-blir-ra, "house of the g."; 1. c., 15, 16, g%-bar;p. 51, no. 64, 1:2, L?-GE-~L~.-~.

H., p. 20: 20, 21), is none other than the dIrkalla, the "god of the irigal" or "great abode", the "house of Dumuzi" (&I.3292), tho "Arallu" or "netherworld" (M. 3290, 3291), or also oalled the bti ek-le-ti shu-bat dIr-kal-la, "the house of darkness (i. e., the house, where the 'time of darkness' = night, winter, death, is spent, of. ki-ip-su, sbove, p. l l ) ,the dwelling of (the god of)Irkalls", I<. B., VI1, p. 188:29; Zimmern, I<. A. T.3, pp. 636, 637, note. 1.
The Hebrew ??N = U-ru-uk, Erech, represents a good Sumerian reading and tradition: Unu(y)"-ga = Uru(g)hiqa= Iriki-q(kji.
Tho name of Nergal, generally read dNk-unu(y)-gal, must henoeforth be transoribed by dNk-iri-gal =
5 ~ ? != "the strength (strong one) of the great abode", i. e., iri-gal beoomes thus a. syn. of 2-gi(d)-da,"the extended house" = 6-gi(d)-da,where the 6 ought to be road i or i = "house", rather than "strength". Notice also that dNinazu = Dumuzi, the husband of Ereshkigal, appears inC. B.M. 112: 12, as the U-mu;un.a-za &-mu-anE (sio!). qji-da],for whioh the parallel passages have Umun-6 (sic!)-zuu m u n 6-qi(d).da = [be-el]E-shu-[ma],R.

Iri-gal is s variant also of dru-gal or eri-gal, "the great oity", cf. Zimmern, 8.

Lastly, the name d A B - ~b,y which Ninib and Dumuzi are designated, ought to bc road dIri-siiam, "the irrigator" = "fruotifier", thus called as the "gad of the fertility of the ground", ef.

For Nergal as "son of Enlil", scc H. A. V., p. 428. We have here a clear example of s transferrcnce of certain names, attributes and functions from Nergsl, tire "lord of the netherworld", i. e., from Nergal in thc r61e of Dumuzi, to d I M . This justifies the inference that d I X , the successor of d M A R - I ' U , the god of the "Westlsnd", was in Canaan wlist Dumuzi was in Babylonia: - the "god of the powers of nature", who "died", was "bewailed" (of. here the wsilings over tho dcath of Adad-Rimmon, i. E., d l M , in Zech. 12: 11) and
"rose" every year "to new life". For d M A R - T U in the r81e of Dumuzi, see now N. F., A 0 4331 + 4335, where, as was to be expected, this god appears as the "son of An" (dumu An-na, col.

Tho Ishtar-Tamuz cult of Canaan is clcarly of Sumerian origin and importation. For this interohnnge of zag and za, cf. luqal-rag-qe = lugal-za-ge, "of tliy king", Gudes, Cyl.A, X: 6.

is the wife also of dNilz-a-zu,l who is identified with Ninib,z the Dumuzi of the Nippur trinity. Hence, dilrin-a-zuis one of the several names of D ~ m u z i . ~ Taking all of the above given passages into consideration, we may safely conclude the following: a) Gzi-an-ni-siwas originally a temple at Erech where the goddess Gashan-an played the rBle of Ishtar, the "Mother" and "bride" of the "Son" Enlil. b) Later on Gzi-an-ni-sibecame the name of the temple of each and every goddess who was looked upon as the Ishtar of a certain trinity in a particular locality. c) As the netherworld is merely a reflex of the macro- and micro-cosmos, &-an-ni-si became, like Gi-gzin, Iri-gal, d-gi(d)-da, a name for "netberworld", hence the addition dib-ha in our passage. This "netherworld", like its prototype Erech, was divided into "seven divisions". Each division was surrounded by a wall with two gates (one in the west and one in the east), presided over by two gate-openers (r~i-dii),one of whom stood a t the outside and one at the inside of the gate. Each of these "seven divisions" had also a "watch-dog": "the seven dogs of Gula", which in the Greek mythology became the "dog with the 'seven heads"': "Kerheros".4 Ishtar (Venus), being the of the d - a n - n i s i had, therefore, to become also the goddess of the "netherworld": Ereshkigal, Proserpinu. The same is true, of course, also of Dumuzi, "the lord of the Aralli". d) Seeing that gzi-si changes with gh-si-il, the phonetic writing for gd-sil = daldlu, muddlu, and that gzi-sil is a variant also of gzi-zal(za-~l)=~dalilu, rnudallu, tashiltu, we may be justified in seeing in the &-~zi-an-ni-sai name signifying "temple of the heavenly rejoicing", i. e., of the joys and pleasures which reach unto the heavens (an-ni).

joys and pleasures are those which Dumuzi and Gashan-anna experience in the "hridalchamber" (G&-an-ni-si= =)w,hen they, like Nergal and Ereshkigal, are joined in happy wedlock. Another song of this tablet, beginning with col. 11 : 12ff., pictures Ishtar, the "bride", bewailing her "beloved" Dumuzi. This song consisted originally of more than five stanzas of four links each; each stanza being introduced by: sha(b)-mu gi-&-ra edin-nu nu-mu-un-ma-al, col. 11 :3, 7, 11, 15, 19. Col. 11, 11. 12-14, 16-18 are repeated, with slight variants, in col. 111: 15-20. On account of the various linguistic difficulties as well as the many new and interesting names for "netherworld", to be encountered in this song, it would seem most desirable that the notes and explanations should precede the transcription and translation.

E r is also = takkaltu, "wailing", which sometimes is represented by the Sum. gi-sir(= BI), the syu. of gi-sir(= BU) = malilu (root elglu), "flute of wailing". This shows that gi-er-ra is = er-ra, just as gi-sir(sir) is = sir, sir, sir, the syn. of er - all with the meaning "to wail, to weep", which wailing, weeping, at the time of the Sumerian lenten festival, was in all probability generally accompanied by tunes upon a flute (gi).

XHA(B)-MU,lit. "my heart", is a term of endearment, beingapplicable to bothDunluzi (so here) and Ishtar; cf. N. F.,A 0 4328, Rev.

Sha(b)-muna-mu-tcn-ma-a1 is = sha(b)-mdmu-un-ma-al. EDZN in the Dumuzi texts signifies always the "desert" in the sense of "netherworld"; cf. G.

This edin, though originally = "desert" or "netherworld", is very often translated by bttu,l i.e., "the house" par excellence, the "house", "abode", where Dumuzi 1ives;z but according to M. 3292, the bEt dDumuzi is a syn. of iri-gal or "great a b ~ d e " ,of~ qabru or ''grave". ( M . 3293), of i r ~ i t i mor "netherworld" ( M . 3291), and even of A-ra-li (M. 3290). Dumuzi, therefore, must not only be identified with the Umun-iri-gal, "the lord of the great abode", or with ' E n - l ~ i ,"t~he lord of the netherworld", but he may and actually does appear in our texts as the U-mu-un(-e)A-ra-li, "the lord of the A."5 There seems to have been, however, in this edin.a special "house",,or "temple", or "palace", which served as a habitation for Dumuzi while in the netherworld, and which was patterned after some terrestrial prototype. This conclusion is justified not only from the occurrence of such
.,
names as &-edin-nae or E-gal-edin-na,7 but more particularly from the fact that according to B. E., XXVII, no. 1, I V : 40, Dumuzi is said to be the d ~ i i i r ( ~ e r ) - sii.,e.8, "the glorious
-
bridegroom", of the &-A-ra-li; cf. also I1 R., 61 : 14, where the &-edin-na appears as the &-52 sha (Z)Ararni, i. e., as the "52"' name of the 'temple of Larsa' " -a passage which shows that the "house of the netherworld" was in all probability patterned after the temple of Larsa, where Shamash (or his son ' h ' u m ~ g ( ~ ) a ( npl)a)yed the r6le of Dumuzi. The place where this edin was considered to be situated was the northern part of Babylonia; hence, the "netherworld" appears in the Dumuzi texts as the edin(-ma)A-IJAkige9 = si-e-ri (si-ir) Sh~(Su)-'-a-ra.'~But the northern part of Babylonia served merely as the prototype or pattern of the north of the macro-cosmos. The netherworld, therefore, as a macro-cosmic quantity must be sought in the north, the region of the cold, the winter. In the winter, then, Dnmuzi is in the netherworld.

Prom the above given translation it will be evident that I cannot agree with Zimmern, S. K., p. VII, who thinks that "hier wird, nachdem vorher in Kol. V I der Gott Tamuz unter seinen verschiedenen Namen mit den Worteu 'warunz (oder: bis wann?) ruht er?' wiederholt angerufen worden war, ganz in der gleichen Weise diese Frage auch an, die verstorbenen Konige von Isin, Zdin-Daqan, Zshme-Dagan, Libit-Ishtar, Ur-Ninib, Bur-Sin usw. qerichtet. Es werden diese also sozusagen als Tamuze aufgefapt, deren Wiedererstehen aus dem Grabe man kann die Sache wohl kaum anders auffassen - man ebenso erhofft, wie man alljahrlich die Wiederkehr des Tamuz aus der Unterwelt erwartet."
O n the contrary, Ishtar in the text quoted is apparently in the netherworld (A-ra-li mu-un-tush, col. VI :20), here she wishes "to lie down" or "rest" - here in the netherworld which is the abode of Dumuzi and of the deceased kings of Isin. Apart from this, EMESAL texts never mention the resurrection of Dumuzi - this is referred to in texts only which are written in the EME-KU dialect. Seeing that the above quoted passage is in many respects similar to that of Macmillan, B. A,, V, p. 674, and R. H., p. 126 (no. 80), as Zimmern already has pointed out, we may be justified in identifying the edin H A - A of Zimmern (col. VI : 33) with the edin A - B A k h fMacmillan, and this the more so as we find a similar interchange in the name Win-A-HA-tar-rd(kud-du)s,o generally, which in B. E., XXVII, no. 1, col. V : 4, 6, is written "Nin-HA-A-tar-rci. The "god of HA-Aki-a" was '1Silig-galu-du(g)3i,. e. Marduk, the "son of Ea (Eridu, the ocean)", also called dDumu-zi-ahztc4or dDumu-zi dumu I n R. H., p. 55 : 3-6, we have the following succession: Oru-$i-ib (= Eridu), dsh-mah, 4sh-abzu (two temples of Eridu), A-HA", while in C. T. XVI, 6 :239, NUNh' A-HA''
Aooording to tlie analogy of the preceding arrangement of this tablet, we should expect in 11. 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, a name of a.king, i. e., five kings; but according to theRilpreoht tablet there ought to follow six kings. a Those traces ought ta correspond to dSin-ma-gir; or is this [Da-mi-ip-i-]li-sbd, tlie last of the Isin kings? If so, this hymn must have bocn cornposed after tlie time of the Isin dynasty. U . E., XXVII, no. 1, 111 : 32. C. T., XXTV, 16 : 30 (cf. 35) = 28 : 82a (cf. 84b). l'in~hos, P. S. B .

= Eri-du(g)u Su-ba-ri are mentioned together. Lastly, in C. T., XV, 2 col. VIII :2, 3, Shu-mi-r[i-i-im]is apparently in opposition to Shu-ba-ru-ti-urn,standing in the same reiation as "Shumer and Alckad" = Ki-en-gi-ki-Uri (BUR-BUR), for we read: An-nu-urn sha-al-la-at Shu-mi-r[i-i-irn] e-li-isha-a i-li-[u]S, hu-ba-ru-zi-urnlu-Li ir-shi-it ka-za-zi-im-[ma] sha-at-ti-sha-am-maShu-mi-ru-urn li-ik-ta-za-az-zi, i. e., " 0 Anu, the booty of Shumer let them not bring up; let Shubaru (so with Hommel, Gr~ndri/3p~., 252, note 1, against Winckler, 0.L.Z.,1907, Sp. 346, and Ungnad, 1. c., 1908, Sp. 67) be the goal of their ravagIng; yea, let Shumer ravage it yearly". Comparing these passages, we will have to admit that A-&A or HA-A became a designation for the "netherworld" simply and solely for the reason that it formed, like the later Akliad, the northern part of Babylonia, i. e., Mesopotamia. In the north, then, the Sumerian netherworld has to be sought. This north was the sphere of the "Son". The south and the north stand in the same relation as does "an" to "ki", Eridu to Subari (= NUNV to A - H A ) ,Ea to Marduk or the "Father" to the "Son".
There must have been, however, a time, when the city of Nergal, Kutha (Gzi-d'ii-and), was Babylonia's north par ezcellence, becoming for this reason, like A-HA or & ( ~ i s h ? ) banda(da)", a designation of the "netherworld". In fact, i t seems not improbable that even Gir-sun. more particularly in its older form Su-gir", formed at one period of the Sumerian history and religion the "north", with Erechz and Eridu3 as well as Nippur as its opposite or "south". This conclusion may be inferred from the following considerations: The older Subaru occurs in later inscriptions as Subartu - a word which renders the Sumerian Su-EDINni (Br. 198; M . 114) as well as (Br. 234), which latter may very well be a variant of Su-girhi3. If this be true, we may with Thureau-Dangin ( S .A . K. I., p. 268) and Winckler (0.L. Z . , June 1907, Sp. 284) assign to the sign EDIN the value bjr.(or possibly bar)" which would be the regular EME-SAL form for the EME-KU r g . This gives i s t h e following development: Su-gXr (yir) = Su-bir (bar, ba-ri) = Suvari = Su-'-a-ri6 = Sl~u-'-a&,originally Girsu, later on the whole of northern Babylonia. And if Su-gir be also = Elamtu or "Elam" (Br. 233), so is this development merely parallel

I n Elam is to be sought the "cedar-mountain" with the "cedar of 'Irnini", guarded by Humbaba and reached (cf. below, p. 27) by Gilgamesh at the beginning of the 4" month (= 4thtablet), the month of the winte; solstice: December-January, when the sun reaches his lowest point in the north. The above indicated development of the northern part of Babylonia, beginning with Nippur as its original center and later on gradually extending over Su-gir (Gir-su, Elam), Kutha, A-HA (Subaru, Akkad), Armenian mountains, Westland, until it bordered the Euphrates or the "sea of the going down of the sun" in the west, the Tigris in the east, and the lake of Urmia or the Van sea in the north, necessitated, of course, a revision of the primary conccption of the Sumerian netherworld, which, like its terrestrial prototype, was henceforth considered a) to be "wide" or "extended" (damal)2; b) to form - on account of its vastness - a cosmic quantity by itself, being, therefore, divided into an "upper" and a "lower" d i n (an-edin k i - ~ l i n ) ~ ; c) to be surrounded by "water" - hence, the name of Dumuzi: mulu gzi-6a-ra4, "the man of the strange shores"; hence also the occurrence of an @edin,"river of tho netherworld", which was full of fearfulness (ni).5 Through this netherworld led a "wagon-road" (bar-ra-an r'shgi&r)fi or "street" ( ~ i l ) ~ ,

See above, p. 17, note 2. Gudea, Cyl. A, X X V I I : 21. That this river was originally and primarily an actual rivcr of Babylonia, goes without saying and is indioated by its occurrence in R. T. Ch., nu. 46, Rev., I : 1. Sf. on this "river of the netherworld" farther below, p. 26, note 3). See above, p. 20 : 31, and cf. in this oonnection the diV?n-hav-ra-an,shove, p. 14, note 3. A "wagon-road" t'his is, becsuse some of the gads like dUtu or Shamash, are said to "ride" through the heavens (and hence also through the netherworld) upon a. "wagon". I n the case of Shamash the "wagon-road" would be that part of tho ecliptic whioh falls in the winter half of the year, corresponding as nuch t o the ul of the summer half (see above p.8, noto 3). The Semitic translation "difficult road" (besides "wagon-road") is due, probably, t o thc idea. t h a t this road, liko t h a t whioh led through the northern part of Babylonia to the Westland, was one over high mountains and steep hills, which made the progress on it slaw and difficult. I t ought to be notioed, however, that in a good many, if not most, eases the so-callcd "dreary" aspeots of the Sumerian netherworld are of Semitic rather than Sumerian origin. Cf. e. g., the Sumerian E-ya2-edin, "palace of the netherworld" (above, p. 19, note 7) and the A ( 8 , El-ri-a, "house of begetting", "bridsl-chamber", which are rendered in Semitic by nancd, for whioh see Delitesch, H .

Generally, however, dPa-sag-yd is the nimgir mashkim (PA-RIAI)-ma&dingirri-e-ne-ge = dI-shum nu-gir la-bi-pu pi-i-ru sha ANmhsh,"the great overseer, the sublime rabipu of the gods" (sc., of the netherworld or the "holy mountain"), C. T., XVI. 46 : 178/9, e t passim. The wife of dIshum is dGashan (Nin)-mug,IIR.,59, Rev., 41, here mentioned immediately after dUmun(Lugal)-iri-a, "the lord(king)of the abode where one cries out: 'alas!"' For dPa.saq.qd as a name of Nergal, see e. q., R. H., pp. 19 :51; 25 :52, 60 (here li-hi-ir dPa-sag-qd); Biillenriicher, Nergal, p. 31 :23; and far Nergal = dPa, see above, p. 25, note 7); from this it follows that dPa is an abbreviation of dPa-sag-gd.Another abbreviation is dPa-sag: cf. Gudea, StatueB, VIII : 63, where dPa-sag is called the nimgir kalam-ma-qe, "overseer of Babylonia" - a most welcome oorroboriltian of our contention that the kalam ar "Babylonia" formed the prototype after whioh the netherworld or "place of darkness" with its street full of wailing was patterned. Notioe also that Eannatum calls himself the mu-pa(d)-daof dPa-sag, St. Vult., Rev., VI :4, or the abarakkn (iskim-ti(1))of dPa-sag, Beldst. A, I1 : 11; B, I1 : 14. The same attribute, viz., "god of the street full of wailing", is ascribed also to dLugal, see 0.T.,XVI,
49 :302, dLugal dinqir sil a-si-ga-ge= dnilu su-qi aha-qu-um-me.
This d P a and dLuqal, although "one" - because they have the same attribute and functions - are yct
"twins", being identified with dUtu and dIAI: of. C. T., XXIV, 186 : 10, dShe-na-i-la-na I dPa u dLugal dUtu u dIM. They constitute also the "twin" stars of the mu%a&an, the eonstcllation of dEresh-ki-gal. The significance of this m"Sahan is indicated by Craig, R. T., I, 58 : 11, where dI-shum (i. e., dPa-say-qd= dPa) and dShu-bu-li are said to be the "gods" of the "Tigris" (hdIdiqna) and the "Euphrates" ("Buranunu), i. e., the eonstellation Satjan or "serpent" is a "river" consisting of two arms: the "heavenly" Tigris and Euphrates, reflecting not only the "terrestrial" Tigris and Euphrates but also those of the "netherworld", because muzSa$an is the oonstelliltian of dEreshkiqal, "the queen of the netherworld" and "wife" of Nergal or dNin-a-zu ( 0 . T., XVI, 46 : 166; cf. also 1. c., 10 :37 with 50 :8, 9 ) , i. e., Dumuzi. Seeing, furthermore, that Nergal as well as dNin-a-zu and Dumuzi are the "gods of the netherworld", and that Nergal is identified not only with dPa but also with dShu-bu-Z6(IV R., 26:Qa; R. H., pp. 19, Rev., 5 ; 22 :63), we may he justified in maintaining that the netherworld had indeed a "river", an ideain. This conolusion is corroborated not only by: a) C. T., XXV, 11 : 18 = 15, I1 : 8, where the Dumuzi of the Nippur trinity, tho god Ninib, "who guards the decisions of the father Enlil" (napir ESH-BAR a-hi dEn-lil), is called dgAL-aAL-(la),compared with "Synchronistic History" ( = Winokler, U.

Now, as dIshum ( = Alad = Ninib) is the god of theTigris, i t would follow that the dSa$an must be the god of the Euphrates; hence, %a-&-an = Pn-rat-tu, Br. 3168. Tho netherworld, then, like its terrestrial and heavenly counterparts, had likewise a. Euphrates (in the west) and a Tigris (in the east). When the gods entered or left the netherworld, they had to cross these rivers. This mado "ships" necessary. Of such ships or boats we read repeatedly, of. H. A. V., 386 (here in conneetion with dAm-an-kiand drshtar); C. T., XV, 17, the m6-g&, "boat", "house-boat" (Hilprccht, B.E., Series D, vol. V, part 1, pp. 52ff.)of god Sin.

where every one who passed it cried out: "a", "a-a", "wa-wan, u-a", "a-&-a", "a-dan"5, etc., "alas!" "how long still?" "when at last?" This "street" led, no doubt, to the 2-edin or the ~ - ~ a l - e d i nw"hich contained the "bridal chambern7 and which was reacheds, in all probability, at the time of the winter solstice, in the "month of sowing" (shu-numun-nu) or also called the "month of Tamuz" (Du-'-u-zu, rwn), i. e. our December-January.
The edin was, of course, inhabited by all kinds of "living creaturesn$ - including
Dumuzi's leaving the netherworld, i. e., his resurrection, is indioated in tho heavens by the sun crossing the equator a t the time of the vernal equinox. At this time, then, Dumuzi had to cross the "river of the netherworld "(Styz) -an event whioh was symbolically re-enacted upon earth a t the time of the New-Year or A-ki-ti festival (which oo-incided with the vernal equinox), when the gods were "conveyed" in "ships" from one temple (the "place of darkness") to another (the "plaoe of light"). It msy not be impossible that the Sumerisns regarded the very "river" of the netherworld s s the "street" which led to the "oonflux" of the "rivers", where there was the "isle" of the "blessed".
* Literally "full of a", i. e., akulap, adi mati, "sla~!""how long still ?" "when a t last ?" Thus I would prefer to explain this phrase, against Delitzsoh, H. W. B., p. G8Ga, "leiduolle Strape", "Leidensweg", and Jensen, K. B., VI1, p. 354, "stille Strape". Surely, the a cannot be oonnectcd with sil: this would be a grammatical impossibility. Against our explanstion is by no means the fact that sheg(for a-shey) =shayummatu; or that si(g)-si(g)-ga-bi(for a si(g)-si(g)-ga-hi)= shaqummesh. For such an omission of a, cf. a-ri-a = &a; a-nim-ta = nim-ta; a-sig-ta = sig-ta; a-rd(ra)-zu= rd-zu; a-ah-dk(g)= ah-d6(g); a-k-a = 6-a. Cf. here also suoh names as divin-a-xu, "the lord who knows (hears) the &!as-cryings" (so rather than "lord of healing"); dLugal-iri-a, "the king of the 'abode (full)of alas"', i.e., the netherworld; dUmun-s-a, "the lord of the 'house (full) of alas'"; kur a-she-ir-ra,the "land where one cries out (she-ir= sir = <ardhu): 'alas!"', etc., eto. This is the prototype of the Greek ' ' A ~ w ( L s )and of the Latin Adon(is), see B. E., Series D, vol. VI. See above, pp. 19 and 25, note 6. Cf. I V R., 27 (add.

d ) the hi-el edin-na lil-16, another of the seven evil utug. This name is rendered either by ar-dalat li-li-i, Sm. 49 (Bezold, "Cnt.",p. 1376) or by ar-da-tu sha btt za-ki-ki (Br. 4532) -translations which show that btt za-ki-ki =

The function of "shepherd" is a necessary consequence of the conception which the Sumerians entertained with regard to their edin and is one of the inseparable attributes of the "Son" of a given trinity. The "Son", being in each and every case the "lord of the netherworld", was necessarily consaered to be the "ruler" and "shepherd", the "guider" and "care-taker" of all beings to be found in the edin - whether these beings be gods, kings, men or animals. I n the prehistoric or An period, the "shepherd" was the "Son" of An, 'En-lil, who even as "Father" retained among his "seven foremost names" that of sib nu-cim-sag-gi(g)-ga6, or more generally sib sag-gi(g)-ga7, "shepherd of mankind". Though shepherd himself, Enlil had two other shepherds under him, viz. the dNin-ma-gulcal-1u8, "lord of the sheepfold", and the d N i n - a m a s h - a z a g - g a " , "lord of the pure fold", both of whom are designated
I am". Cf. also the name of Uumuzi: Umun-sa-p6r, "lord of tho net", into which are gathercd all who go down to the netherworld. See above, pp. 21ff.. where the kings of Isin are to be found in the netherworld. Cf. the sag-gi(g)-edin, "the black-headed (people) of the nethe~world",Zimmern, S. K., p. 24, no.25, Rev., col. V I I I : 16. To these "bensts" of the edin belong, among others, a ) the mash-gir ni(g)-ti-g6ledin-na, Gudea, Cyl. B, I V : 18, probably the "swift gazelle (B. E., X X I X , p. 84,

2 sib hz' sig(sig-sig)-gadEn-lil-Za-ge,"two shepherds of the beautiful (not yellow!) goats of Enlil". In the EME-SAL texts dNin-amash-azng-gaappcars as dUmun-amash-azag-ga who is termed sib zi-da2 = ri-hum ki-nu, "legitimate shepherd". Like the "sheep" or "ewes" (ganam, sherba) or "lambs" (sil, sil), these "goats" ( h ~ )to~g,ether with their "kids" ( d s h , mash), are in the Dumuzi texts a euphemistic expression for the "maidens and their young ones" holy or consecrated to the Ishtar cult, whether living in the terrestrial folds (harems) or in those of the netherworld.4 Aboves we heard that dEn-ki, "lord of the netherworld", though originally merely an attribute of Enlil, became at a later time confused with the "god of the ocean", i. e., with 'E-a. To this confusion is due Ea's attribute "shepherd of the goats", see C. T.,
XXIV, 42 : 134, dEu-[lil-6]banda177 (= d ~ - as)ha sib ziz, i. e., "Enlil-banda ('the mighty Enlil') is Ea as shepherd of the goats". The r6le of Enlil as Dumnzi, i,e. as the "true son" of An, was played in the "Westland" by dMAR-TU7dumu An-nu. Hence, this god must liliewise appear as a "shepherd", if our theory of the development of the Sumerian religion be correct. That this is true,
is evident from Thureau-Dangin, N. F., A 0 4331 + 4335, Rev., col. I : 3 ff., where Ishtar addresses dMAR- TU as follows:

After Enlil had displaced An, the "sons" of Enlil usurped the rAle played by their "Father". Among these "sons of Enlil" with the title "shepherd" may be mentioned the following:

C. T., XV, 28 :3, 22. Cf. the sdb-ba en dDwmu-zi, below, p. 39, note 3. This attribute betrays still oleerly the fact that the original and first Dumuzi was Enlil, the "Son" and "shepherd" of An. I n R.

When in the later development of tho Sumerian religion the rBle of Enlil as Dumuzi was transferred to all the other "Sons" of the-various trinities, dDumuzi, like An, Enlil, Ishtar, acquired s generic significance (H. A. V . , p; 404, note 31). This is the reason why we find such a peouliar writing as dDumu mkh-zi, IIIR., 66, Obv. 31a,, 13d, 18a, Rev., 24a - a writing which is by no means a "graphische Spielerei (zur Bezeichnung des langen C?)", as 5

4) Bertin, J . R. A. AS.,XVII, p. 65, col. I :6, has @f = su-uq = u-zu-zu (root naz6zu).
But naz6zu is also = 1,i. e., shd(q),or a ,i. e., shd(q)-shzi(q),see IV R., 30 : 3/4b,
mu-un-shd(g)-shd(q)-gi-e=shi-za-zu, cf. Zimmern, 2.A., XIV, p. 389; Thureau-Dangin,
2. A,, XVIII, p. 191, 6. Hence, @ in EME-KU = sdq, variant of g= shzi(q), which
in E M E - S A L becomes szih, su-ha(&),shd(b) = v$k. For the interchange of "q" and "b" and of "s" and "sh", see Fossey, H. A. V., p. 110 : 12; p. 119 : 43. But what would be the meaning of Du(1)-szib-hafrom this point of view? Zimmern renders it by "Hirlenwohnunq" and Langdon by "sheep-folds" - translations based, no doubt, on 1V R., 27, no. 1 :1/2, where shh-ha en 'Dumu-zi is translated by ri-&-urnbe-lim dDumu-zi,"shepherd, lord D." I n view of the passages given above, it is, however, somewhat doubtful whether the Semitic translation ri-e'-um is justified in this particular case, and this for the simple reason that slib changes with shzi(h). Two explanations would seen1 to suggest thcmselves, either shd(h) has also the meaning "shepherd", or szib is merely a variant of shd(h). If the latter be true, a translation "hill of the beautiful one" or "beautiful hill" might be suggested, thus making du(l)-shu(h)-haa synonym of du(1)-azag-qa,"holy I n support of the latter view the following facts may be mentioned: Dumuzi is very often called dKA-DZi-hi-shd(h)-ha&w, hich is translated in R. H., 153, col. I11 : 10ff., by dKA-DZ sha pa-ni ha-nu-[ti],i. e., " K . of (with) beautiful5 eyes (face)".
Cf, also C, T,,XXV, 6: 10, dIgi-vv "1 r - a c " n " h " " h " ~ ~ u ( ~ )1 'jy(= dKA-DI);K. 4337, 0 1 1 1: 1 , where the "river of Dumuzi" is called: S ' ~ + ~ S H U ("Bb)e,autiful river", or "river of the beautiful one"; and notice that in C. T., XXV, 27a: 15, the X H ~ J ( B ) is identified with the Dumuzi of the Ur trinity and the 966s (3oukaios of the month Ezen-dDurnuzi, "festival of D." = Tashrctu = March-April (time before Nabona~sar),th~e month during which the marriage and resurrection festivals of Dumuzi were celebrated. Seeing, then, that in the expression du(1)-szib(shd(b))-htahe szib and shd(b) are used interchangeably, it may very well be possible that Dumuzi as the szib-ha was originally

the "beautiful' one" and that consequently the du(1)-szib-hawas either the "beautiful hill" or the "hill of the beautiful one". This observation helps us to explain still another name of Dumuzi, viz, the Zi-hi-ir ( d ) ~ - m u - u n - s u(b&)-hi, IV R., 30, no. 2, Obv., 17; Rev., 5 = R. H., p. 67 : 16; IV R., 27, no. 1, add p. 6a:S; Mscmillan, B. A,, V, p. 674 : 9; C. T., XV, 20 :8; above, p. 21 : 38, who is called in the E M E - K U texts dLugaZ-sub-bi,I1 R., 59, Rev., 44. Zimmern renders this name by "Anfuhrer, (Gott)Herr des Gebets", and Langdon by "prince, lord of adoration". In view of the above given passages I prefer to see in sub-hi another variant of st%-ba(bi), shd(b)-ba(bi)= "beautiful one", translating the whole by "bridegro~rn,b~eautifu13lord". Cf. also Dumuzi's name dLugal-sub-bi, "beautiful king", C. T., XXV, 39c : 12. The similar name which designates Dumuzi as the *En-Zigir-si = dUmun-libir-si,I1 R., 59, Rev., 8, is, therefore, nothing but "the lord, the glorious bridegroom".
This designation of Dumuzi is by no means isolated. Many other similar names have been ascribed to him, as, e. g., i-hi-lum-lum,i-bi-ld-ld, see above, p.27, note9; i-hi-ylin-nu-g6n-nu-c (parallel withKA-hu-tu-ul-hu-tu-ul-e, "the one of irresistable voice"), see C. T., XV, 18:27; B. E . , Series D, vol. VI; dLuga2-igi-&ur@-ra,"the beautiful (bur = band, M. 6404) king", followed by dLuyal-igi-ra-mah-di,"the valiant (youthful) king with benign cauntenance (p8n ribpu)", 6. T., XXV, 38e: 1, 2. Li-bi-ir = susaptnu = K>*>WlW, "Brautfiihrer", Zimmern, 8. B. T., p. 212, and references there given. For li-hi-ir used in this sense in thc Sumerian Lenten songs, cf. also R. H., p. 101 : 48/9, where Ishtar complains: ?irn ki( !)-el-hi nu-hul-lu-[e-ne] lirn kal-bi nu-li-bi-[ir-e-ne] "The city's maidens do not rejoice a n y more, "The city's youths d o not lead home the bride a n y marc". Cf. also Zimmern, S. K., p. 43, no. 40, Rev., 4.
For s6b. ~htl(b),sub with the meaning "beautiful, glorious", of., among others, the following: [d,\rinn-tin,dib]-b8azeyi su-uh An-na, "the glorious princess of An", no. 9, col. I : 4; dBi-li-li, the sister of Dumuzi, cslls herself KA( ?)-azag-gi-lze su-ub-ha me-en, "among those of radiant oountenanee ( ?) the most beautiful (glorious) one I am". I n C. T., XV, 23b: 9, the goddess Girgilu is described as gab-ni su-ub atag-ga al-sun-e, "she whose glorious and pure bosom is beautiful". Whatever is beautiful may, sooording to Sumcrinn ideas, be "kissed", henoe, su-ub = "to kiss, to adore, t o worship" = shub (labdnu). This su-ba may sometimes be lengthened by da (cf. ma-mu(m6) = ma-mu(m6)-da) or by du (cf. li-da = li-du = li-di = li; si-im-da = si-im-du = si-im; dsh-da = dsh-du = dsh), hence, we find t h a t Isbtsr calls herself saLegisu-be-da mi-en, "the glorious, besutiful princess I am", Pinohes, Manch., V : 24. dNin-a-zuof I M n 6is called tho en KA-sub-da-ye, "lord of (among) those of beautiful face"; of.

But whether we translate du(1)-szih-haby "shepherd-hill" or by "beautiful hill" matters, in the last instance, very little; the chief thing is that it is identified with the A-ra-li,' the great and extended field (edin)2 over which Dumuzi as shepherd and lord keeps guard:
edin-ki en-nu-icg-gci mu-un-da-ab-d~(du(g)) "Over the netherworld he keepeth g ~ a r d " . ~
The netherworld, then, is the great "fold" where all living creatures have to spend, at one time or another, their "night" (6-zal),where all are at rest. From thence they are "led out" by the "great shepherd of the sheep", Dumuzi, on the "great morning", the spring and resurrection morning, to wend their way as "stars" in the heavens. To this place goes4Ishtar, the "Bride", to be joined with the "Lamb" in holy wedlock. The netherworld becomes in this wise not only the ki-sha(g)-kush-shd6 in-nin6 e ~ l i n - k a , ~ "the place where the heart of the mistress of the edin is a t rest", but also and especially an edin-na ki-azag-gu = $rim ash-ri el-li,8 "a holy place", a k i - ( ~ - ) r i - aa, ~"place of begetting", a "bridal-chamber".'O Col.

E., XXIX, p. 64; Series D, vol. V2, p. 6 1. But as the "north" was, according to Sumerian conception, the region of the "netherworld", kur acquired this significance likewise. The destruction of this mountain or netherworld has become an accomplished fact when Ishtar, a t the time of the vernal equinox, appears in the heavens as "virgo" (month Elul = February-March) and "Mother" or "Ninm a r (month Tashrttu = March-April), i. e., when she as Proserpina has left the winterhalf (kur-ta.. .2') and has become the Venus of the summer-half of the year. Kur, when used in the sense of "netherworld", is generally translated in Semitic by %iturn. Thus we find, among others, the following expressions: GabLkur-raz= i-rat ir-si-tim, "breast (bosom) of the netherworld", to which Dumuzi has gone (i-in-di), IV R., 30, no. 2 :22; Thureau-Dangin, N.

of Enlil), with dGti-ba(bar)-ral= 'Ashraturn (wife of MAR-I'U), with *h'ha-la (wife of IM), and with dNin-gal (wife of Sin). But Gashan-sun is the wife of dLugal-banda.2 This Lugal-banda is according to H. A. V., p. 416: a) dEn-lil,"lord of Kullab". But above, p. 35, note 6, we saw, that "lord of Kullab" is one of t,he names of Dumuzi; hence, Enlil = Dumuzi, and Gashan-sun = Nin-anna (as "mother") and = Ninlil (as "bride" and "wife" of Enlil). b) 4SU&, the "lord of Ashnunns", i. e., *Nin-it~t,h~e son of Enlil. Nin-ib, accordingly, must likewise have played the r61e of Dumuzi, while Gashan-sun must have been the same as Ninlil (= "mother") and Ba-ti(= "bride" and "wife" of Nin-ib). In corroboration of this the following passages may be mentionned: In C. T., XV, 22 : 10, the goddess Ba-ti has among other titles also that of ama Gasha-an-sun-na, for which the duplicate text, Zimmern, S. K., p. 4, no. 2 :31a, gives the variant ama ga-sha-an ki-La-ga-sa, "mother, mistress of Lagash"; but the "mistress of Lagash", Ba-ti, was the wife of Enlil's son *Nin-Girsu,4who is, as is well-known, identified with Win-ih. Also in Zimmern, S.K., p. 6, no. 3 :31h, Win-sun appears in connection with dNin-ib, dNin-Gir-su and *Pa-bil-sag,6 while in I. c., p. 15, no. 11 : 19a, Ga-sha-ansun is called ama i-ra, "mother of the city (?)", i. e., originally Erech, later on Nippur.7 There can, then, be no doubt that Gashan-sun was also a name for Ba-ti, the wife of Nin-ib, who for this reason was called 4Fn (= Umun)-bandas and who, therefore, must have played the r61e of the d-mu-un or Dumuzi. c) d U t ~ ,the son of Sin; the Gashan-sun from this point of view would be as "mother" = dNin-gal, and as "bride" and "wife" = 'Innanna or 'Ishtar, the wife of Shamash. But even this does not yet exhaust all possibilities in connection with the various and manifold transfers of the r6le of Dumuzi and Gashan-sun.

Among t'he names of Dumuzi occurs one which designates him as the dumu (tu-mu) ti-mu-un-mu(sh)-zi-da",s~on of2Nin-yish-zi-dan.3 According to this Dumuzi is the son of dNin-yish-zi-daand "ashan-sun or dBa-il. Both are frequently coupled together so as to appear as "husband and wifen.4 Stat,ueE, VIII : llff., records that Gudea brought his god "kgish-zi-da to dBa-il into her temple a t Uru-azag-ga("holy city"). Statue G, I1 :gff.,

tells us that dNin-yish-zi-dawas introduced into the temple after Gudea had presented the wedding presents to dNin-Gir-su and dBa-u.6 I n Cyl. B, XXIII : 18ff., dNin-gish-zi-da is said to be "the god" (dingir) and dNin-sun-nathe "divine mother" (dinyir-ama)of Gudea. I n designating them thus, Gudea tells us that dNin-sun-na is the ama-HE numun-zi-da numun-ki-cig-gd-cim,"the mother who gives birth to the 'true offspring', who loves her offspring", . and terms dNin-gish-zi.da the dumu-KA An-na-kam. That the rendering of dumu-KA by "descendant" is merely a guess, is plain and goes without saying. But what does this term mean ? From H. A. V., p. 420, it is evident that K A in ""'errin-na-KA (C. T., XV, 27 : 10) changes with zu in rGherin-na-zuof the duplicate passage, C. T., XV, 30 : 13, hence, K A may be read zil, cf. also Br. 517. In the expression i-hi-zu-bar-mu-un-sh=i-kiih-nish nap. li-is-su of R. H., p. 59 : 19/20, the zu is evidently a variant of zi; hence, zil = zu = z i = k?2nu, ktnish, "true". This result justifies us to read dNin-gish-zi-dadumu-zil An-nakam and to translate i t by "N., the 'true son' (i.e., the Dumu-zi) of An". I n doing so, we are enabled to establish the following two parallel genealogies: An = An dNin-yish-zi-da= 'En-lil 'Dumu-zi = son(s) of 9%-lil (dSin,dNin-ih,dNin-Gir-su,etc.). This means a) that, dNin-gish-zi-da,the "true son" of An, is merely another name of En-lil, tho "son" of An; b) that the r61e of dNin-gish-zi-da(= dEn-lil),the original dumu-zil, has been tra,nsferred to dDumu-zi, the "son of Umun-mu(sh)-zi-da"(= son(s) of En-lil),i.e., a t the time of Gudea and of the kings of the IIdynasty of Ur, the r6le of Dumuzi was pla,yed by dr'in at Ur, by dNin-iha t Nippur and by dNin-Gir-suat Lagash, with 'En-lil (= dNin-gish-zida ) as "Fathern and with Gashun-sun or &Ba-ilas "Mother" and "Bride", hence her at

tribute "mother of the lord", hence Gudea's statement that dNin-sunis the "mother who gives birth to 'true offspring"', which "true offspring" is, of course, the "true son", Dumu-zi; hence, lastly, Ba-ti's designations: sal-shd(g)-gal or nu-nunuz shci(g)-gaz, "graceful woman", or sal-si-a dBa-ti ~hci(g)-ga,"~beautiful woman, graceful (gracious) Ba-3' designations which evidently identify Ba-h with the in-nin dZnnanna mulu shd(g)-ga mulu sig-ga, "lady Ishtar, the graceful and beautiful one", Zimmern, S. K., p. 33, no. 29 : 14/5a. There still remains, however, another difficulty which ought to be mentioned and explained here. According to Gudea, Statue I, I :4, dNin-gish-zi-da is not the dumu-zzi of An, but the "sbn (dumu) of dNin-a-zu".4 This "Father" and "Son" are mentioned, either with or without the name of the "Mother", dNi-gir(i)-da,between them, in several other passages as, e. g., I1 R., 59, Rev., 34 -36: dNin(Umum)-a-zu- dNi(Gashan)-gir(i)-da, his wife - dNin(Umun)-gish(mu(sh))-ziR-.daH;., p. 86 :6 -7 = 134, col.

IV:12-34, dNilz-a-zu(of IM") - dNin-gish-zi-da(of ~ ( ~ i ~ h ? ) -(i?)b").G~ ~ d Ba ut - and this is noteworthy - in the list of the 3coi /3ouA;aio~,7the place of dNin-a-zu is occupied by "in-ib (month of Tamuz) who is followed by dNin-gish-zi-da (month of Ab). dNilz-a-zu,the father of dNingish-zi-da, then, is none other but dNin-ib, the Dumuzi of the Nippur trinity and the 9eds povaaios of the month Tamuz; hence also Dumuzi's name: ur-sag dUmun-a-zu, "hero Umun-a-zu". This dNin-a-zu, though originally the same as Nin-ib, the son of Enlil, played in I M k Y h e r61e of the "Father", like An a t Erech or like Enlil at Nippur.

ki-kal is here evidently the "place of the youthful one", i. e., of the "lord"' D u m ~ z i .B~ut Dumuzi is the "lord of the netherworld", hence ki-kal = "netherworld" (syn. of edin, A-ra-li, which latter is here parallel with ki-dDumu-zi, ki-kal). Seeing, however, that the "netherworld" was according to Semitic conception a somewhat dreary place, a place of "ruinsn,3 the ki-kal acquired in course of time the meaning "ruined, desolated, uncultivated place".

"place of Dumuzi", the "Arali", the "place minus strength" - all of which are here in

parallelism with k/garash.
2. This place, being within or in the innermost and most secret parts of the great fold (thr),the earth, and hiding within itself all dead and living things, came to be looked upon as the great "womb",6 hence karash = karshu, karasl~u,"Leibesinneren, De.litesch,H. W . B.,

between the ka-ab-gaz-e and the mulu d-ld-a. In view of the fact that ki-d-ld-a is a name for "netherworld", of which Dumuzi is the mulu or "lord", and that the mulu ka-dsh-ka-sa (= ka-ab-qaz-e, H. A. V . , p. 441, note 5 ) is likewise a name for Dumuzi,l I prefer to see in the mulu shu-du(da)-aa designation of Dumuzi (with whom, in fact, this term is in parallelism) and in the ki-shu-da-a the "place where Dumuzi as the shu-du-a keeps himself". This being so, C. T., XV, 20 :28, 29, might be read and translated as follows: mulu shu-da-a e-ne-ra mu-un-da-gir(zi1)-e mulu d-ld-a e-ne-ra mu-ur~-da-gir(&l)-ei,. e.,
"To 'the smitten one', to him with him(= the gall&) she (= Ishtar) goes; "To 'the one without strength', to him with him she goes" If illaku and ilku really do belong together, the shu-da-a may possibly mean "governor, ruler, commander", sc. of the netherworld.

Leaving the various grammatical impossibilities3 of the Semitic translation out of consideration, the following ought to be noticed in connection with this passage: 1. The very fact that the Semitic translator gives for 11. 1 and 4 several renderings, shows that he himself had some difficulty in understanding this passage. 2. The hur of 1. 4 is parallel with sub. This shb, either "shepherd" or "beautiful onen,4 is, of course, Dumuzi; hence, the bur must be Dumuzi likewise. We know5 that Dumuzi had the name dLugal-igi-hurE"-ra "the king with beautiful eyes (face)", thus showing that, bur = bani2 ( M . 6404), "beautifuY6.
3. B u r and sub are parallel also with the lum of 1. 1. Above7 we have seen that Dumuzi was called the i-bi-lum-lum, probably = la bdbil pdui, "freundlich, gut",8 because lurn = babBlu, "hervorbringen, erzeugennQ,is a synonym of ushshubu (root esh6bu1°), "hervorkeimen, E"rucht tragen"" and unnubu, "uppig keirnen, Frucht tragen".lz Tounnubu belongs also enhu which, when applied to a woman, has the meaning "Uppigkeit, Fruchtbarkeit", and when applied to a man that of "strotzende Kraft, Zeugungskraft". Dumuzi as the lum might, therefore, be very well the "manly one, the one possessed with virility, der Zeugungsfahige,'3 the charming one, the beautiful one".
This gli stands in R. H. lower than the preoeding mu. I t is probably intended to explain the bur, which the annotator wishes to take in the sense of gli-bur = hdru sha nam.me, see Delitzsch, H . W. B., p. 275, a. Translated by Zimmcrn, A. O., XIII, p. 11:
"Wie lange noch mit dem Spriefien, das festgehalten ist, wie lange noch rnit dem Grunen, das gebunden ist; mit dem Schicksal(?), das niedergehalten ist, so dafi der Hilt in Verniel~tungdasilzt, mit der Satzung des Landes, die niedergehalten ist ?" Langdon, S.B. P., p. 307, renders: "Haw long shall the springing of verdure be restrained? "How long shall the putting forth of leaves be held back? "My city is oppressed: the shepherd sits in desolation. "In my city the laws of the land are suppressed". 3 As, e. g., that the a in liru-me-ais not sooountcd for; that tlie bur-mu in 1. 7 is altogether ignored; that the mu of 1. 4 has no Semitio equivalent, eto. eto.

4. A-Id = al-16-a1= a1 (= 16, Br. 10194/5), being translated here by the three variants immahk, ikkamii, ikkasii, must be merely different writings of one and the same word: 6-16,, which means literally "minus st,rength", while the ki-d-ld-ais the "place of him who is minus strength", i. e., of Dumuzi, the god of the powers of nature, who is "impotentnduring the winter, the time of barrenness.

Disregarding the Semitic translation, I would prefer to render the above given passage a,s follows: "How long still that 'the manly one' how long still that 'the manly one' be without strength, be without strength, "That my 'beautiful one' be without that the shepherd ( ? 'beautiful one') sit strength, like one undone, "That within my city3 my 'beautiful one' be without strength". This gives us the desired antitheses: manly -yet without strength; beautiful -yet without attraction: despised, undone, annihilated, in misery is Dumuzi while in the kid-16-a. C O ~ . 11: 14, 16.

But e-she-me-inis the gloss also of KI-E-NE-DI (= kippc, Br. 9746), which in col. I11 : 18, appears as a variant of KI-E-NE and is parallel with ki-shu-e. Prom this it follows that KI-E-NE-DI = KI-E-NE. The D I may be explained either according to p. 41, note 3, or it may be = d,a variant of sa-ga, sci-da = shci(g) = damqu, bane, "beautiful", see p. 46, note 6. Jensen, K. B., VI1, p. 395, translates kippe by "Freuclenkammer, Freudenort der Ishtar", and its synonym melultu, which he derives quite correctly from el&lu,"to shout, to cry (either in joy or grief)", by "Freudefiort, Xtatte geschlechtlicher Freude". The literal translation of ki-shu-e is '!place of the 'tent, abode (shu = phonetic writing for shh) of em'. This e is again a phonetic writing for cf. the &-~hzi-a",th~e house of the 'tent of a"', the well
known adyton of Marduk; the a . . .a-ri-a in the expression a An-nu a-ri-a-mish= sha ribfit dAni+nrib4 (Br. 11458) which changes with a , . .e-ri-a in Gudea, Cyl.

T., XXIV, 11 : 38 = dNin-amash-e,4 "the (true) mistress of the 'fold of en', 1. c., 24 :55. Now, as a = e has the meaning rih&sha rihetu or rihetu, it becomes at once evident that the ki-shu-e is the "place of begetting", the "bridal-chamber", the most holy and sacred compartment in a given tenlple, the adyton par ezcellence, where Ishtar and Dumuzi pass their wedding night at E a ~ t e r . ~ According to our text, this place is prepared by the "lanlb", the "goat" and the "kid" - three euphemistic expressions by which Ishtar designates herself (and her maidens) as the "virgin" (sil,' "lamb"; mcishs, "kid") and "mother" (ziz,"'goat"";pp. "kid"). The ki-shu-eand the KI-E-NE(-DI),therefore, are correctly designated by Jensen as the "Stitten geschlechtlicher Preude der Ishtar". Col. II:17. MU-LU BAD-DU.

note 2 ; p. 44, note 4, and see also p. 52, note 5 . The mu-lu bad-du is, of course, Dumuzi; while the ki-tush, being parallel with the eshernen, "bridal-chamber", and the &-mushen, "place of the 'birds"', is the "harem" inhabited by him and Ishtar. Of this harem Dumuzi is the "god" (dim-me-ir).The parallel expression of col. I11 : 19, is in all probability to be emended to:
[mu-lu bad-du] ki-nu-mu-ni-ib-gi-ra-shh
"On account of the far removed one, who to his place has not returned". The ra of the verbal suffix ra-shzi can be explained only by supposing that gi-ra is here a phonetic writing
"
for gir, gir, gi-ri, etc., to go, to return to". Col. I1 : 18. KZ-MUSHEN(HU). The HU = nzushen is exactly as reproduced; this excludes, it seems, a reading ki-ri (= ki-ri-a, H . A. V . , p. 398) or ki-nina (cf. the d-nina above, p. 33, note 4; p. 36, note 2). For mushen, "birds", as a designation of the "maidens" (ardatu) of Ishtar, see H. A. V., p. 399. The ki-mushen, "place of the maidens", is, however, a synonym of d-a-ri = 112 ar-da-tum, R. H., p. 83 :29, 30; cf. H. A. V.,p. 398.
Somewhat difficult is the expression e-ba-ni-in-du(g)-gah,ere and in col. I11 : 20. The e may be = lzi, "behold". But what would be the meaning of du(g) ? "To cry out" ? This would leave the infixes unexplained. On account of these difficulties, I consider e . . .dh(g) to be a variant of a , . .dzi(g) = shun6 sha nakri; cf. here such passages as C. T., XV, 13: 21/2 = IV R., 28, no. 4, Rev., 32/3, where we read:
h u a-dh(g)-ga u gi-a-zzc [ana? ali] sha nak-rum zi-sha-nu-u a-hu-lap tu-ur-shu (Nibrun')a-dti(g)-ga a-ta mar-ra-zu sha nak-ru ana me-e sa-lu-u, i. e.,
"The 'city', which the foe has when a t last wilt thou have mercy turned upside down, upon i t ? "(Nippur), which the foe has when a t last wilt thou have compassion turned upside down, upon it ?"l
Cf. also IV R., 28, no. 4, Rev., 37 -42. We may, however, connect mu + dzi(g) and read mu(sh)-e-ba-ni-in-dd(g)-gaF.or mu(sh)-dh(g)= gish(ush)-dh(g),see D. T. 67 (= A.S.K. T., p. 119), Obv., 18/9 (Delitzsch, H. W.

Col. I1 :20, 21. SHU or ME-RZ GZSH-SHUB-BA. With gish-shub, which apparently is here an adjective applicable to both "hand" and "foot", cf. Gudea, Cyl. A, XXIV : 17, 6

and gish-shub, cf. sig gish-shub-ba.. .gar, "to put the brick into the 'form"', Gudea, Statue E, I11 :9; pisdn gish-shub-ba, "the form-box", 1. c., I11 : 1 (= piscin gish-d-shub-ba,Statue F, 1 : 12). Cf. also gish-shuh = pitpanu, "bow", and especially Thureau-Dangin, N . F., A 0 4330, face I1 : 7, 8, gish-shub mulu gish-shub. From thcsc passages it seems t o be evident that gish-shub means "to throw (into) wood, to encase". The "bow" is the "wood (i.e., the 'arrow') thrower"; the "form" is the "wood" into which the clay is "thrown" to form it into a brick, which "wood" was in the shape of a "box" (piscin).The id gish-shub-ha is a canal with a wooden casing at its borders to keep the earth or ground from falling into the canal bed. The shu or me-ri gish-shub-ha,therefore, designates the "hands" or "feet which are thrown into a wood (yolie),' which are encased, fettered". If this explanation be correct,, Dumuzi, while in the netherworld, must have been considered to be one whose hands and feet, though "radiant with splendor" (mi-shu-pa),2 were yet gish-shub-ba, "fettered" -an observation which explains why the Semitic translator should have rendered the ki-d-ki-aby ashar ikkamc or ashar iklcaszi, "the place where is bound, fettered" everyone and everything that inhabits it. It is, no doubt, the cry of the "fettered" Dumuzi of which we read in Zimmern, S. K., p. 30, no. 27, col. 111: 8,
shu-mu gi-ga gir-mu gi-ga ama-mu nu-ri-zu

"true Son" as a mulu gish-shub-baor "fettered one" is the result of an evil " ~ p e l l "(~gu) which has been "woven around" or cast over Dumuzi. Ishtar ('Innanna), by her bal-bal,= brings this "spell" to an end. The action of "yi", being attributed to "hand" and "foot", must be something which both members can do. The best translation of gi seems to be "to raise, to lift up, to elevate". In this sense we find shu.. .gi-gi in Rim-Sin, Kanephore B, I1 : 11, "a kingship which gladdens the heart, a reign of graciousness,may dKAL(Lama)shu-a-gi-gi3the protecting deity by intercession (lit. by lifting up of hands) before (ki-ta)An and Ishtar for them (i.e., Kudur-Mabuk and Rim-Sin) implore".
