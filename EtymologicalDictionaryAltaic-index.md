PREFACE
This is a first attempt at an etymological dictionary of Altaic languages. The history of Altaic comparative studies is a difficult one. Even now there is still no consensus among scholars on the very problem of the existence of Altaic as a genetic unit. We sincerely hope that this publication will bring an end to this discussion, which has lasted for more than 30 years. The dictionary presented below should by no means be regarded as final and conclusive. We have tried to collect all existing etymologies that seem to be semantically reliable and fit the established system of phonetic correspondences. Among the 2800 etymologies presented approximately half are new, developed by our team during more than 10 years of preparatory work. New etymologies will most certainly follow, while some of those presented will doubtlessly be rearranged or even refuted in the course of future research. The current reconstruction will also inevitably change - as it happened with Indo-European, Uralic and most of the other established language families during the decades of their investigation. Nevertheless, we regard it as a valid starting point, worth presenting to the general academic audience, and look forward for criticism, suggestions and corrections. Wherever necessary we give references to etymological literature, although we decided to keep the discussion as short as possible. Many existing etymologies are not mentioned in this dictionary because they contradict the system of correspondences followed in the present volume or because we think we have found better solutions. It would be futile, e.g., to struggle with some of the etymologies linking words with Jpn. *p- to those with Altaic *k ̔-, since we do not believe that such a correspondence exists at all. We must say, however, that most of the etymologies presented in the classical works of G. Ramstedt and N. Poppe, as well as very many Japanese etymologies of R. Miller and S. Martin, have been preserved, which in itself shows that the proposed phonological reinterpretation of the Proto-Altaic system is just an extension of previous research. The Altaic family as a genetic unity of Turkic, Mongolian and Tungus-Manchu languages had been proposed as early as 1730 by F. J. v.

Stralenberg. Until the early 20th century, however, there was no clear idea about the classification or comparative grammar of Altaic. The few scholars that studied the languages regarded them rather as part of a common Ural-Altaic family, together with Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic languages - an idea now completely discarded. The undebatable father of scientific Altaic studies was Gustaf John Ramstedt. He started his research in the very beginning of the century, and made a huge contribution both to Altaic studies as a whole and to the study of individual subgroups of Altaic. His research was concluded by the fundamental “Einführung in die Altaische Sprachwissenschaft” published in 1952, two years after his death in 1950. Ramstedt formulated many basic phonetic rules of correspondences between the Altaic languages, laid the foundations of Altaic comparative grammar, and finalized the subclassification of the Altaic family by separating Uralic from Altaic and adding Korean and Japanese to its classic “Western” core. Other scholars whose contributions to the Altaic field were really substantial are N. Poppe, K. Menges, V. Tsintsius, V. Illich-Svitych, S. Martin and R. A. Miller. A full account of their achievements would deserve a special study, but suffice it to say that due to their efforts a basic reconstruction of Common Altaic was already available by the late fifties / early sixties of the 20th century. A reaction started in the sixties. A number of scholars (for some reason, primarily Turcologists) initiated what seemed at that time a counter-Altaic revolt. The names of the main anti-Altaicists are G. Clauson, G. Doerfer and A. Shcherbak. Among them G. Doerfer should be distinguished as the most consistent, most fruitful, and most vigorous in his anti-Altaic efforts. Although the arguments of anti-Altaicists were many - from phonetic to lexico-statistical - their basic argument can be summed up as follows: the relationship between the Altaic languages is not what a genuine genetic relationship should be. All the numerous resemblances between them were explained as a result of secondary convergence within a “Sprachbund” of originally unrelated languages. The whole idea of the original Proto-Altaic unity was very seriously threatened. Simultaneously the Eastern branch of Altaic - Korean and Japanese, or Korean-Japanese - was brought under heavy suspicion. No serious alternative for Korean was proposed, but an active search for non-Altaic relatives of Japanese began. Distinguished scholars like S. Murayama (who always hesitated between the Altaic and Austronesian affinity of Japanese) and P. Benedict started searching for Japa

nese-Austronesian parallels, with Benedict (following mainly the Japanese scholar Kawamoto) finally proclaiming the inclusion of Japanese without Korean and Altaic - into his Austro-Thai family. After a critical evaluation of the problem we came to the conclusion that Altaic should be still characterized as a genetic unity, probably forming a branch of the larger Nostratic macrofamily, but certainly a separate family on its own. The very fact that it is possible to compile a dictionary of common Altaic heritage appears to be a proof of the validity of the Altaic theory.
The work on the dictionary started in the late 80’s. Initially we worked together with I. Shervashidze, who later switched to different projects, and the work was continued by S. Starostin, A. Dybo and O. Mudrak. We must gratefully mention our numerous younger colleagues and students who helped at various stages of compiling the dictionary, and especially Ilia Gruntov, Vladimir Glumov, Vasiliy Chernov and Martine Robbeets. The work was sponsored by grants from the Soros (“Open Society”) foundation, from the Russian Foundation of Fundamental Research and the Russian Foundation of Humanities; since 1997 the research was supported by the Investor Group “Ariel” within the framework of the “Tower of Babel” project. All the work was conducted within the STARLING database created by S. Starostin. The Altaic database is constantly available on line at the Web address http://starling.rinet.ru. Special thanks go to programmers: Ph. Krylov who designed the Windows version of STARLING software, Yu. Bronnikov who designed the scripts for the Internet site; and to S. Bolotov who designed the fonts for this complicated edition. We would like also to express deep gratitude to colleagues who had read the manuscript and given us many valuable suggestions, both stylistical and etymological: Bernard Comrie, Alexander Lubotsky and Cormack McCarthie.

CHAPTER ONE
THE PROBLEM OF INTERLINGUAL BORROWINGS
IN ALTAIC LANGUAGES
Since the gist of the anti-Altaic criticism is the idea that what Ramstedt and Poppe regarded as common Altaic heritage is in fact a result of later borrowings, it is this problem that we shall tackle first in the introduction. This problem is of utmost importance for the whole Altaic theory. We must be able to distinguish between commonly inherited morphemes and borrowed ones - since interlingual borrowing was very widely practiced during the final stages of the development of Altaic languages. There are two basic contact zones in the Altaic area: the Turko-Mongolian and the Mongolo-Tungus. There had also been some contacts between Tungus and Korean, Korean and Mongolian, Korean and Japanese - but they are relatively insignificant in comparison with the very intense Turko-Mongolian and Mongolo-Tungus contacts.
1.1. Turko-Mongolian contacts.
It has been convincingly demonstrated by several authors (in a most detailed way by Clark 1980) that there are no (or almost no) Mongolian loanwords in Early Old Turkic, i.e. before the 13th century A.D. However, already in the Secret History of Mongols (13th c.) we find a number of identifiable Turkic loanwords. Logically enough, in Late Old Turkic, Middle Turkic and modern Turkic languages we also find a large number of Mongolisms. This can only mean that Turko-Mongolian contacts started in the 13th century, and there were no direct contacts before that time. But there is also a large number of Turko-Mongolian matches that cannot be explained as post-13th century loans. This fact was acknowledged by most critics of the Altaic theory, and a bold attempt was made by Doerfer to explain such matches as being prehistoric loans from Turkic into Mongolian (for Altaicists, of course, such matches rep resent rather common inherited vocabulary). Let us formulate the criteria that distinguish early Turkic borrowings in Mongolian loans from the inherited vocabulary ( = prehistoric loans in Doerfer’s terminology).



14 INTRODUCTION
1. The words involved are attested in Turkic before the 13th centur y; 2. They appear in Mongolian in a form typical for 13th century Uyghur/Karakhanide Turkic The latter criterion means that in the donor language the following changes occurred, compared with Proto-Turkic: a) voiced *d-, *g- > *t-, *k-; b) *ĺ, *ŕ > *š, *z; c) long vowels and diphthongs disappeared. The most obvious criterion here is b), since the correspondences Turk. *ĺ (>š) : Mong. s and Turk. *ŕ (>z): Mong. z, ǯ, s only occur within this layer of loanwords (see Clark 1980). Let us take a closer look at such cases: PT *jāĺɨl ‘green, greens’ (OT jašɨl): WMong. jasil ‘buckthorn’ PT *gEŕik ‘turn, order’ (OT kezik): WMong. kesig ‘wake, turn’ (already in MMong. as kešik) PT *gEŕ- ‘to walk, walk through’ (OT kez-): WMong. kesü-, kese- ‘to wander, roam’ PT *eĺi ‘lady, beg’s consort’ (OT iši): WMong. esi ‘empress’ (MMong. esi) PT *seŕik ‘feeling’ (OT sezik): WMong. sesig PT *(i)āĺ-ru ‘exceedingly’ (OT ašru): WMong. asuru PT *dūĺ- ‘to meet’ (OT tuš-): WMong. tus(u)PT *kīĺ ‘sable’ (OT kiš): WMong. er-kis ‘male sable’, ebsi-gis ‘female sable’ PT *Koĺ ‘pair’ (OT qoš): WMong. qos(i) (MMong. qoši) id. PT *Koĺ ‘hut, camping’ (MK qoš ‘family’): WMong. qos(i) (also qošlɨɣ > WMong. qosiliɣ) PT *jüŕüm ‘grape’ (OT üzüm, jüzüm) > WMong. üǯüm PT *jmiĺč ‘vegetable(s)’ : MMong. (HY) ǯemiši PT *Kạĺčɨ- ‘to scrape’ (OT qašɨ-), *Kạĺčɨ-gu ‘scraper’ (e.g. Chag. qašaɣu): MMong. qaši’ur ‘scraper’ PT *biĺč-, *bɨĺč- (OT biš-) ‘to become boiled’, *bɨĺč-lak ‘smth. boiled’ > WMong. bis(i)laɣ, basilaɣ ‘a k. of home cheese’ PT *Kar-ĺɨ ‘opposite’ (OT qaršɨ) > WMong. qarsi PT *uluĺ ‘country, city’ (OT uluš) > WMong. ulus PT *jạĺ- ‘blaze’, *jạĺɨn ‘lightning’ (OT jašu-, jašɨn) > WMong. jašin id. PT *jEŕ ‘copper’ > WMong. ǯes id. PT *boĺ ‘free, empty’, *boĺan- ‘to become empty, poor’ (OT boš, bošan-) > WMong. busani- id.; *boĺug ‘permission’ (OT bošuɣ) > WMong. bošuɣ id. PT *aŕɨg ‘fang’ > MMong. *aǯuɣ (ačuɣ in Uygh. script) PT *bogaŕ ‘pregnant’ (OT boɣaz) : WMong. boɣus PT *KĀĺ ‘jade’ (OT qaš): WMong. qas(i) (MMong. qaši) PT *diĺ ‘vessel’ (OT eδiš): WMong. idis(i) id. PT *Kebiŕ ‘carpet’ (OT kebiz): WMong. kebis id. PT *keleŕ / *keler ‘lizard’ (OT keler): WMong. keles



CHAPTER ONE 15
PT *arbɨĺ ‘magic’ (OT arvɨš): WMong. arbis ‘knowledge’ PT *duĺa- ‘to hobble’, *duĺak ‘hobble’ (OT tuša-, tušaq): WMong. tuša-, tusi- ‘to hobble’, MMong. tušaɣa ‘hobble’ PT *Kaĺaŋ ‘lazy’ (OT qašaŋ): WMong. qašaŋ id. PT *Köĺi- ‘to screen’, *Köĺi-ge ‘shadow’ (OT köši-, köšige): MMong. köši-, köšige
From these loans we may infer that: 1. OT š ( < *ĺ) is rendered in Mong. as s, frequently followed by optional -i (Mongolian lacked a phonological distinction between š and s, but s was pronounced as š before i); sometimes we find -š- in front of other vowels (bošuɣ, tuša-) - an obvious feature of incompletely adapted loanwords; 2. OT z ( < *ŕ) is also usually rendered as s, but in a few cases—as ǯ; 3. Initial j- is rendered either as j- (jasil, jašin) or as ǯ- (ǯemiši, ǯes). This may reflect dialectal variation within Turkic (note that many modern languages also display the variation j-/ǯ- < PT *j-) or an OT articulation like *-; 4. No voiced initial consonants - except b - are present in this layer of loans, which is quite consistent with OT phonology; 5. Turkic syllabic structure is retained with the following details: a) verbal stems usually add a vowel (kez- > kese-, kesü-; tuš- > tus(u)-); this is explained by the fact that Mong. has very few monosyllabic verbal stems. b) polysyllabic nominal stems usually do not, but occasionally also add one (tušaq > tušaɣa);
c) monosyllabic nominal stems never add a vowel (except the parasitic -i after -s- - to render Turkic š); 6. vowels are usually quite faithfully retained - except ɨ which is regularly rendered by i (of course there is occasional variation between o and u, and of weak vowels in the non-initial syllable); 7. voiced intervocalic consonants are rendered as voiced (notably -g- is rendered as -ɣ- > -0- in boɣaz > boɣus, cf. Kalm., Dag. bōs).
Now if we investigate the loans from Mongolian into modern Turkic languages we find a very similar system of correspondences: WMong. sibaɣu(n) ‘bird’ (MMong. šiba’un) : Chag. šibaɣun WMong. qaɣurai ‘dry’ > Tat. qawrai WMong. qaŋsiɣar ‘beak, nose’ > Uzb. qanšar WMong. dabaɣan, MMong. daba’an ‘mountain pass’ > Chag. taban WMong. ɣaɣursu (Khalkha gūrs) ‘chaff’ > Kirgh. qaursu WMong. qara- ‘look’, qaraɣul ‘patrol’ (MMong. qara’ul) > Chag. qara-, qarawul



16 INTRODUCTION
WMong. egeči, MMong. egeči ‘elder sister’ > Chag. egeči WMong. ǯabsar, MMong. ǯab(u)sar ‘gap, interval’ > Kirgh. ǯapsar WMong. girɣaul, ɣurɣuul (MMong. xurqa’ul) ‘pheasant’ > Chag. qɨrɣavul WMong. ɣura(n) ‘roebuck’ (MMong. qura-ltuq) > Oyr. quran WMong. silegüsü(n) ‘lynx’ (MMong. šile’usun) > Kum. silewsün WMong. soqur (MMong. soxar, soqor) ‘blind’ > Koman soqur WMong. ǯuuqa ‘stove’ > Leb., Kumd. joqqɨ WMong. šigüder, MMong. ši’uder(en) ‘dew’ > Chag. šüdürün etc. Of course the system slightly differs: Mongolian voiced initial consonants are usually rendered by voiceless Turkic ones (since voiced consonants are only retained in Oghuz languages that had hardly any direct contacts with Mongolian and obtained all their Mongolisms through Kypchak and Karluk intermediaries). But in general we see that both loans from Turkic into Mongolian and vice versa reflect generally a single socio-linguistic situation: intensive Turko-Mongolian contacts after the 13th century, with loanwords flowing in both directions - a situation quite consistent with what we know about the history of Turkic and Mongolian peoples. A well-known fact, however, is the existence of a large number of different Turko-Mongolian matches, frequently doublets to those investigated above. Thus we have OT azɨɣ ‘fang’ (PT *aŕɨg) corresponding to WMong. araɣa, arija, MMong. ara’a, aral id. Doerfer and other anti-Altaicists (e.g. Shcherbak) would like to view such cases also as borrowings, but belonging to an earlier stratum. We can indeed reconstruct a hypothetical (as Doerfer would put it, “teleologische Sternchenform”) PT *aŕiga borrowed in PM as *ariɣa, and having later lost the final vowel. Note that we cannot presume the other direction of borrowing, since PM had no *-ŕ-, and in the case of a borrowing from Mong. into Turkic we would expect something like *arɨg. But what about MMong. aral ‘fang’, ara-tai ‘predator’ - forms clearly derived from a root *ara- (*ari-), together with the form *ara-ɣa / *ari-ɣa? In order to explain these forms we have to use a more imaginative scenario: a) either postulate a PT root *aŕɨ, lost in all attested Turkic languages and borrowed in Mong. as *ari (*ara), along with its derivative, PT *aŕɨ-ga; later the new derivatives *ara-l and *ara-taj were formed on Mongolian ground, while the plain root *ari was lost, just as in Turkic; b) or postulate PT derivatives *aŕɨ-l, *aŕɨ-taj (with suffixation quite peculiar for Turkic) that were borrowed into Mongolian together with *aŕɨ-ga, but were subsequently lost in Turkic. Needless to say, explanations like this are unsatisfactory. A much easier and more elegant solution is to trace both Turkic and Mongolian



CHAPTER ONE 17
to a common Altaic root *aŕi, with a common old suffix *-ga. As is frequently the case, the suffixless stem was not preserved, but it gave rise to a set of derivatives in Mongolian. Besides providing a better explanation of Turko-Mongolian matches (and the case of *aŕɨg is not isolated - there are literally hundreds of such cases), such a solution also helps to avoid the inevitable conclusion at which Doerfer arrived in his investigations: that all early loanwords marched in only one direction - from Turkic to Mongolian. Indeed, Turkic has more distinctions than Mongolian in what concerns, e.g., the oppositions *l-*ĺ or *r-*ŕ. Mongolian has only *l and *r, thus all cases of Turk. *ĺ : Mong. *l and Turk. *ŕ : Mong. *r are to be explained as borrowed in Mongolian from Turkic; and there are no obvious cases of a converse situation. But oneway borrowing is a specific situation which requires an explanation. This may be either a big difference in the cultural levels of contact participants, which we have absolutely no reason to suppose in this case, or borrowing from a dialect which once existed (and of course also borrowed from the other contact participant), but later ceased to exist. We would thus have to suppose that Old Turkic (and in fact all other Turkic languages) are descendants of a PT dialect that had no contacts with Mongolian; but there existed a hypothetical “sister-Proto-Turkic” that had contacts with Mongolian but later ceased to exist without leaving any trace. We see that the general scientific principle of Occam’s razor clearly speaks in favour of the genetic relationship between Turkic and Mongolian, since this is inevitably the simpliest solution in all available cases.
1.2. Mongolo-Tungus contacts.
Borrowings from Mongolian into Tungus-Manchu languages are quite abundant. The majority of them penetrated from Mongolian into Manchu, and from Manchu into the other Tungus-Manchu languages; but a considerable number penetrated also from Dagur into the neighbouring Solon language, and from Buryat into Evenki and the neighbouring Even and Negidal languages. How can we distinguish Mongolian loanwords from inherited common Altaic etyma? Consider the following examples: PM *hiǯaɣur ‘root’ : Evk. (Kamn.) iʒagur, Sol. oǯōr PM *hüre ‘seed’ : Sol. ur PM *hergi ‘steep bank’ : Man. ergi PM *hačiɣuri ‘favour’ : Nan. ačeuri



18 INTRODUCTION
PM *harga(l)-sun ‘dung’ : Evk. argahun PM *hojimu-sun ‘stockings’ : Evk. oimahun, oimusu
PM *hab-taj ‘sorcery’ > Evk. aptaj, *hab-galdaj ‘shaman mask’ > Evk. awaɣaldaj
PM *huta-sun ‘thread’ > Evk. uta-sun PM *hergi- ‘go round’, *hergiɣül- ‘turn round’ > Man. erguwe-, Evk. ergūlge ‘device for tanning skins’ ( = Mong. *hergiɣüleg), Evn. ergin-. These and many other examples reveal one phonetic peculiarity: a correspondence of PM *h- : TM 0-. They also have another peculiarity: in the vast majority of them the wordform structure of Mongolian (including all derivational suffixes) is faithfully retained in TM languages. It is obvious that the words entered TM languages already after the loss of *h- in Mongolian - which (in Northern Mongolian dialects) occurred as early as in the XIVth century. Consider now another group of examples:
PM *hila-ɣan ‘fly’ : Orok pulikte, pumikte, Evk. hunmikte (PTM *pulmi-kte) ‘midge’ PM *hünir ‘smell’ : Orok pū(n) ‘smell’, Evk. huńŋukte- ‘to smell’ (PTM *puń-)
PM *halagan ‘palm (of the hand)’: Ul. pańa, Evk. hanŋa, Man. falaŋɣu id. (PTM *palŋa)
PM *hari- ‘be tired, exhausted’ : Evk. harū-, Man. fara- ‘to faint, feel giddy’ (PTM *paru-) PM *heki ‘head’ : Evk. hēje ‘forehead’, Man. fexi ‘brain’ (PTM *pējKe) PM *hiru-ɣar ‘bottom, ground’ : Evk. here, Man. fere, Ul. pere(g) (PTM *pere) etc. This group of examples has a quite different correspondence for PM *h-, viz., PTM *p-. If we suppose borrowing from Mongolian, we have to assume that: 1. This borrowing occurred long before the XIVth century, in the period when Mong. *h- was still pronounced as *p- (a feature not preserved in any Mongolian dialect); 2. This borrowing occurred even earlier, namely, during the epoch of Common TM unity (somewhere in the 1st millennium BC), since all of the above examples belong to the common TM wordstock, so apparently were borrowed into PTM; 3. Borrowed were not the Mongolian forms listed above, but their roots, which were later supplied (in many cases) with different TM suffixes. Many other groups of examples also show very specific features. Cf.:



CHAPTER ONE 19
a) WMong. qou ‘all’: Evk. kūkte, Orok kupu-kte WMong. qalu- ‘to come near’: Orok qal- id., Man. xanči ‘near’ WMong. kere- ‘quarrel, fight’: Evk. kerbe- ‘kill’, Man. keru-le- ‘to fine’ WMong. qura ‘rain’: Evk. kur-ge-kūn, Ul. kūre(n) ‘storm’ WMong. küči(n) ‘strength’: Evk. kusī- ‘to fight’, kusīn ‘strength’, Man. xusu-n id.
b) WMong. qučil- ‘to scrape with fingers’ : Evk. osī-, Orok χosị- ‘to scrape’ WMong. kilɣa-su ‘hair’: Evk. inŋa-kta, Orok sịnaqta id. WMong. kür ‘precipice’: Evk. ure, Orok xure ‘mountain’ WMong. qudurɣa ‘tail strap’: Evk. irgi, Orok xudu ‘tail’ WMong. kele(n) ‘tongue’: Evk. inńi, Man. ileŋgu, Orok sinu id. In group a) we have words with PTM *k-; in group b) - with PTM *x-. Mongolian in both cases has k- ( = q- in front of back vowels). So why would TM languages borrow the same Mongolian phoneme both as TM *k- and TM *x-? Note that both groups of examples seem to be archaic enough (different suffixation and wide distribution in TM). To explain this picture we can either postulate two different phonemes in early Mongolian (at the time of borrowing > TM), e.g. *k1 and *k2, with this distinction lost and not reflected in any variety of Mongolian, or try to presume a different direction of borrowing (TM > Mong., with both TM *k- and *x- > Mong. k-; but why not *x- > Mong. h- in this case?). This all is theoretically possible, but certainly the usual solution a historical linguist assumes in such cases is that we are dealing with genetic relationship and that two phonemes have to be reconstructed for Proto-Altaic (in our case - *k and *k ̔), which converged in Mongolian, but stay distinct (as *k- vs. *x-) in Tungus-Manchu. We see that here, too, a hypothesis about common origin fares much better than the loanword theory. Of course, there are loanwords from Mongolian into TM languages, but they are recent (certainly after the XIVth century) and penetrated from Mongolian into different TM languages (basically - into Manchu and Evenki, also through a different route - from Dagur into Solon) long after the split of Proto-Tungus-Manchu. One of the significant arguments that Doerfer raised against the Altaic theory was the absence of common Turkic-TM vocabulary. Indeed, if the three families are not related and all the lexical parallels observed are due either to borrowings in Turkic from Mongolian, in Mongolian from Turkic, and in TM from Mongolian, we would expect no common



20 INTRODUCTION
Turkic-TM parallels without Mongolian intermediaries. But in fact we do have quite a number of such cases, somehow overlooked by the critics: PT *ăčaj / *ĕčej ‘elder female relative’ : PTM *asī ‘woman’ PT *Ebü(r)dek ‘duck’: PTM *ābu, *ābu-lduka ‘a k. of duck’ PT *bạk- ‘to look, watch’: PTM *baKa- ‘to find’ PT *bAja ‘recently’: PTM *baǯi- ‘early’ PT *bilik ‘wick’: PTM *bulin id. PT *bɨrak- ‘to abandon, throw’: PTM *burī- ‘to lose, let go’ PT *bodu- ‘to fasten, attach’: PTM *boda- ‘to accompany’ PT *bul- ‘icy surface’: PTM *belu- / *bul- ‘slippery ice surface’ PT *būt ‘thigh’ : PTM *begdi / *bugdi ‘leg’ PT *čEl, *čEl-pe- ‘film, membrane’: PTM *čalba-n ‘bark’ PT *jak- ‘to burn’: PTM *deg-ǯe-gi- id. and many, many others (see the body of the dictionary). To explain those cases we have either to refute them all, or to suppose a third ancient contact zone (Turkic > TM) which is extremely dubious (there exist loans in Evenki from Yakut and vice versa, apparently reflecting quite recent contacts; but no archaic contacts seem to be observable), or - which is the most preferable solution - once again to presume genetic relationship. A very important issue while formulating any genetic hypothesis is the problem of basic vocabulary. However, to make a correct estimation of the proportion of basic vocabulary preserved in each branch, one needs to have a sufficient knowledge of comparative phonology, i.e. regular correspondences established between languages compared. Here we must agree with the critics: the correspondences established between Altaic languages in the classical works of Ramstedt and Poppe indeed were unsatisfactory in many respects, partially due to insufficient attention paid to the stratification of loanwords. But instead of trying to improve the correspondences and to untangle difficult phonological and lexical riddles, the critics had chosen an easier way: to refute the genetic relationship as such. Some researchers, however, took a different approach. Among them we should name such distinguished scholars as V. M. Illich-Svitych (with his three-way distinction of stops in PA), V.Tsintsius (with her many papers on PTM phonology and the three-way correspondence of stops), S. Martin (with a pioneer attempt at the Korean-Japanese reconstruction, which was largely unsuccessful, but provided a lot of insights into the prehistory of Korean and Japanese) and R. Miller (with many successful attempts at establishing phonetic correspondences between Japanese and other Altaic languages).



CHAPTER ONE 21
All this work was summarized and continued in the book of one of the authors of the present dictionary (АПиПЯЯ). Even since that time many correspondences have been made more precise and some changed, during the prolonged collective processing of the vast Altaic evidence. Below we shall outline the reconstruction of PA phonology as it is now perceived by the authors.



CHAPTER TWO
COMPARATIVE PHONOLOGY OF ALTAIC LANGUAGES
2.0. Root structure
The most common root structure in Altaic languages is *CVCV, occasionally with a medial consonant cluster - *CVCCV. The final vowel, however, is very unstable: best preserved in TM languages (although also not always easily reconstructable because of morphological processes), it is frequently dropped in Korean, Mongolian and Turkic (in the latter family in fact - in the majority of cases). Japanese usually preserves the final vowel, although its quality is normally lost (shifted to the previous syllable or fused with the quality of vowels in suffixed syllables); however, in cases when the final (medial) root consonant is lost (on the process *cVRV-ɣV > *CVRɣV > *CVɣV > *CV in Japanese see below), Japanese reflects original disyllables as monosyllables. Japanese also has quite a number of monosyllabic verbal roots of the type *CVC-. We agree with Martin (JLTT) that these roots were originally disyllabic as well, however reconstructing them as *CVCa- is certainly incorrect. The OJ verbal conjugation shows explicitly that the verbal stems — if we examine their interaction with the gerundive suffix *-i — can be subdivided into three main types: *CVCa- (those having the gerund in -e < *-a-i), *CVCə- (those having the gerund in -i < *-ə-i), and *CVC- (those having the gerund in -ji < *-i). We can only suggest the possibility that the latter type reflects original verbal roots *CVCi (occasionally perhaps also *CVCu, although there are reasons to suppose that some of the latter actually merged with the type *CVCə-). The gerund form in *-i in this case may actually reflect the original final root vowel that had early disappeared before other verbal suffixes of the type *-V(CV)-. A small number of trisyllabic roots such as *àlak ̔u ‘walk’, *kabari ‘oar’, *k ̔obani ‘armpit’ etc. are also reconstructed for Proto-Altaic. It cannot be excluded that in many or most of these cases the final syllable is originally a suffix, but the deriving stem is not used separately and the derivation had already become obscure in the protolanguage.



CHAPTER TWO 23
The monosyllabic structure *CV was typical for pronominal and auxiliary morphemes, but a small number of verbal (and, quite exceptionally, nominal) monosyllabic roots can also be reconstructed: PT *b(i)ā- ‘bind’, PTM *ba- ‘propose for marriage’, Kor. pa, PJ *b ‘string’ (PA *b) PT *jạ-t- ‘lie’, PM *de-b- ‘lay, put’, PTM *dē ‘bed’, *dē-du- ‘lie’, PJ *dà-nt-r- ‘spend the night’ (PA *dḕ) PT *Ko- ‘put’, PTM *ga- ‘take’, PK *kà- id. (PA *ga) PM *ni-ɣu- ‘hide, concel’, PTM *nē- ‘put’, PJ *ná- ‘lie, sleep’, PK *nū-b‘lie’ (PA *nḗ) PT *sa-t- ‘sell’, PJ *si-rə ‘price’, but PK *sà- ‘buy’ (PA *sa) PT *dē- ‘say’, PM *da-wu- ‘sound’, PTM *de(b)- ‘song, tune’ (PA *tḗ) PT *jē- ‘eat’, PM *ǯe-mü- ‘be hungry’, *ǯo-ɣug ( < *ǯa-ɣug) ‘meal’, PTM *ǯe-p- ‘eat’, PK *čā- ‘eat’, OJ ja-pa- ‘hungry’ (PA *ǯē) PTM *pē- ‘be unable, not dare’: PM *ja-da- ‘be unable’, PJ *piá-r- ‘become less, humble oneself’ (PA *p ̔ē) PT *be-ŋ, PTM *be, PJ *bá-i ‘bait’ (PA *b) PT *d-n ‘spirit, breath’, Manchu ǯu-n ‘pulse, vein’, but PJ *tí, PM *či-su ‘blood’ (PA *čū; here the *-n in PT and Manchu is probably suffixed) PM *do-/*du- ‘middle’, PTM *dō ‘inside’, PK *tắi ‘inside’ (PA *dṑ) A special type of cases is represented by a number of verbal roots emerging as monosyllables of the type *CV in some languages, but having the structure *CVl(V) or, less frequently, *CVr(V) in others: PT *ạl- ‘take’, PM *ali- ‘take, receive’, PTM *al(i)- id., but PJ *á- ‘receive’ (PA *ắla) PM *bür-il- ‘die, perish’: PTM *bu- ‘die’ (but bur- in some forms, e.g. in Nanai) (PA *bŭri) PM *ere- ‘healthy, sober’: PTM *eri- ‘to breathe’, PJ *àr- ‘be’: PT *er- ‘be’ (but *e- in many verb forms in modern languages) (PA *ra) PT *gẹl- ‘come’, PM *gel(i)- ‘walk, run after’, PTM *gel- ‘get on one’s way’, but PK *ká- ‘go away’, PJ *k- ‘come’ (PA *gle) PT *Kɨl- ‘do, make’, but PM *ki- id., PJ *kì- (in *kì-túk- ‘build’) (PA *ki(lo)) PT *ol- ‘sit’ (but frequently o- in *ol-tur-, *o-tur- id.), PM *ol- ‘obtain’ ( < ‘become’): PTM *ō- ‘to become; to make’; PK *ó- ‘come’ (PA *ṑlu) PM *hil- ‘warm’, PTM *pile- ‘dry under the sun’, but PJ *p- ‘dry up’ (PA *p ̔ìlo)
PT *sal- ‘to put’, but PK *hằ-, PJ *sỺ- ‘make, do’ (PA *sóle) We reconstruct disyllables here, but the exceptional loss of *r and *l remains unexplained. A possible solution would be to reconstruct those roots as *CVC, with the root-final resonant lost occasionally. However, the number of cases is not large, and the roots in question are



24 INTRODUCTION
frequently used as auxiliary verbs, which by itself could explain the exceptional phonetic development. It is also possible that *-r- and *-l- in those cases are originally suffixed, and the roots belong to the rare (but existing) type *CV. The problem obviously requires further investigation.
2.1. The consonant system of Proto-Altaic
The consonants reconstructed for Proto-Altaic are:
p ̔- p b m t ̔ t d n s z r l č ̔ č ǯ ń š j ŕ ĺ k ̔ k g ŋ
It is interesting to note that *z and *j are in complementary distribution: *z occurs only word-initially, while *j never occurs in the beginning of the word. However, their reflexes are so different that it seems hardly possible to regard them synchronically as a single phoneme.
The correspondences between Altaic languages can be summarized as follows:

2.1.1. PA initial *p ̔
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *p ̔- *0-, *j- *h-, *j- *p- *p- *p



26 INTRODUCTION
Notes: Turkic usually has 0-, but frequently has a j- before original diphthongs *a, *o (note: never before *u). Mongolian usually has *h-, but in some cases also has a j- (before original *e and diphthongs, but much less frequently than Turkic).
The problem of Khalaj h
Doerfer has reconstructed PT *h- which yields h- in Khalaj, but 0- in all other Turkic languages. It may well be that Khalaj indeed reflects a phoneme lost elsewhere. In that case we would certainly expect Khalaj h- to reflect PA *p ̔- (just as MMong. has h- < *p ̔- or Evk. has h- < *p ̔-). The real situation is, however, much more complex. We may note that PA *p ̔- is in fact in the vast majority of cases reflected as Khalaj h-. Cf.: Khal. hadaq ‘foot’ < PT *(h)adak < PA *p ̔ágdi; Khal. haɣač ‘tree’ < PT *(h)ɨ-gač < PA *p ̔[]ju; Khal. hɨraq ‘far’ < PT *(h)ɨra- < PA *p ̔ìra; Khal. hēl ‘wet’ < PT *(h)ȫl < PA *p ̔ṓle; Khal. hārɨ ‘bee’ < PT *(h)ārɨ < PA *p ̔ḗra; Khal. har-qan ‘tired, lean’ < PT *(h)r- < PA *p ̔ra; Khal. hat- ‘to throw’ < PT *(h)ạt- < PA *p ̔t ̔a; Khal. hič- ‘to extinguish’ < PT *(h)öč- < PA *p ̔ōči; Khal. hāčuɣ ‘bitter’ < PT *(h)iāčɨg < PA *p ̔č ̔o; Khal. huv- ‘to rub’ < PT *(h)ob- < PA *p ̔ṑpo; Khal. hüsgün-, hiz‘to demolish’ < PT *(h)üŕ- < PA *p ̔uŕi; Khal. hadru- ‘to separate’ < PT *(h)adɨr- < PA *p ̔ādA; Khal. hīt ‘hole’ < PT *(h)ǖt < PA *p ̔ṓt ̔è; Khal. harq ‘excrement’ < PT *(h)ark < PA *p ̔arkV; Khal. has- ‘to hang’ < PT *(h)as- < PA *p ̔asi; Khal. hidiš ‘vessel’ < PT *(h)diĺ < PA *p ̔ādi; Khal. hur- ‘to hit’ < PT *(h)ur- < PA *p ̔ri; Khal. häräk- ‘to rise’ < PT *(h)ȫr- < PA *p ̔ṓre; Khal. hārt ‘back’ < PT *(h)ār-t < PA *p ̔ṑrí.
There are only six cases where Khalaj has 0- in the place of PA *p ̔-, and all of them can be easily explained as recent borrowings from Azeri or Turkmenian: Khal. ič- ‘to drink’ ( = Turkm., Az. ič-) < PT *(h)ič- < PA *p ̔ič ̔i; Khal. ät ‘meat’ ( = Turkm. et, Az. ät) < PT *(h)et < PA *p ̔ḕta; Khal. aɣīr ‘heavy’ ( = Turkm., Az. aɣɨr) < PT *(hi)agɨr < PA *p ̔àká; Khal. ōn ‘ten’ ( = Turkm. ōn, Az. on) < PT *(h)ōn < PA *p ̔VbV(n); Khal. esür- to cough’ ( = Turkm. üsgür-) < PT *(h)üskür- < PA *p ̔ŭsi; Khal. äkki  ̔two’ ( = Turkm., Az. ik(k)i) < PT *ẹk(k)i < PA p ̔òk ̔e. In all other cases when Khalaj has 0-, the Turkic forms go back to PA roots with *0- or *ŋ-, cf.: Khal. uč- ‘to fly’ < PT *uč- < PA *ùč ̔o; Khal. äl ‘hand’ < PT *el < PA *ŋli; Khal. išüt- ‘to hear’ < PT *ẹĺit- < PA *aĺi; Khal. uza-, uzu- ‘long’ < PT *uŕa-, *uŕɨ- < PA *uŕo; Khal. aɣɨz ‘mouth’ < PT *Agɨŕ < PA *ága; Khal. ol- ‘to be’ < PT *ol- < PA *ṑlu; Khal. ū- ‘to sleep’ < PT *ū- < PA *ŋju; Khal. o ‘that’ < PT *o- < PA *ó; Khal. äm- ‘to suck’ < PT *em- < PA *emV; Khal. aš ‘meal’ < PT *(i)aĺ < PA *oĺe; Khal. it ‘dog’ <



CHAPTER TWO 27
PT *it < PA *ŋndo; Khal. aŋla- ‘to understand’ < PT *āŋ- < PA *ēŋV; Khal. ič ‘interior’ < PT *ič < PA *ič ̔u; Khal. ä-rä ‘that side’ < PT *a- < PA *é; Khal. ušaq ‘knuckle-bone’ < PT *(i)aĺ(č)uk < PA *ằĺča; Khal. ēz ‘inside’ < PT *ȫŕ < PA *ṓŕi; Khal. ānd ‘oath’ < PT *ānt < PA *nta; Khal. äy- ‘to bend’ < PT *eg- < PA *egi; Khal. ēr- ‘to reach’ < PT *ēr- < PA *re; Khal. ēn- ‘to go down’ < PT *ēn- < PA *ŋḗni; Khal. ist ‘upper part’ < PT *ȫŕ-t < PA *ōŕi; Khal. äŋgür ‘dusk’ < PT *ɨŋɨr < PA *ína; Khal. ilgär ‘in front’ < PT *ilk < PA *ílek ̔a; Khal. elč- ‘to measure’ < PT *öl-č- < PA *úle; Khal. īlän‘to cry’ < PT *ɨjŋala- < PA *ùjŋula; Khal. inǯi- ‘suffer’ < PT *ēn- < PA *ēnV; Khal. īš ‘deed, work’ < PT *īĺč < PA *ĺi; Khal. al-t ‘below’ < PT *al< PA *ale; Khal. al- ‘to take’ < PT *ạl- < PA *ála; Khal. är- ‘to be’ < PT *er< PA *ra; Khal. arɨ-, aru- ‘clean’ < PT *ạrɨ- < PA *ero; Khal. arqa ‘back’ < PT *ar-ka < PA *ara; Khal. arpa ‘barley’ < PT *arpa < PA *arp ̔a; Khal. ej ‘front’ < PT *öŋ < PA *òŋè; Khal. ēm ‘trousers’ < PT *(i)öm < PA *umi; Khal. ärin ‘lip’ < PT *Erin < PA *ằré; Khal. ēšük ‘covering’ < PT *ēĺü- < PA *ḗĺpo; Khal. irdek ‘duck’ < PT *Ebü-rdek < PA *jbi; Khal. ut- ‘to win’ < PT *ut- < PA *ut ̔a; Khal. eger ‘hunting dog’ < PT *eker < PA *ŋk ̔u. However, there is a significant number of cases where Khalaj has initial h- which appears to be an innovation (prothesis), cf.: Khal. hil- ‘to die’ < PT *öl < PA *oli; Khal. här ‘man’ < PT *ēr < PA *ri; Khal. hāj ‘moon’ < PT *āń < PA *ńu; Khal. hūt ‘fire’ < PT *ōt < PA *ōt ̔a; Khal. hāj‘to say’ < PT *ạj- < PA *eju; Khal. häv ‘house’ < PT *eb < PA *ìbe; Khal. häšü- ‘to dig’ < PT *eĺ- < PA *ḗĺV; Khal. hirin, hürün ‘white’ < PT *ürüŋ < PA *obri; Khal. hin- ‘to grow’ < PT *ȫn- < PA *ṓni; Khal. havul ‘quiet’ < PT *ăm- < PA *mV; Khal. hāɣa- ‘back’ < PT *(i)āg- < PA *ga; Khal. hāz‘to go astray’ < PT *āŕ- < PA *ḗŕa; Khal. hajaz ‘clear sky’ < PT *ańaŕ < PA *ŋańa; Khal. hikkä ‘lung’ < PT *öpke < PA *op ̔ekV; Khal. häjir- ‘to twist, spin’ < PT *egir- < PA *egVrV; Khal. hiri- ‘to plait’ < PT *ȫr- < PA *ṓre; Khal. ham ‘vulva’ < PT *(i)am < PA *amu; Khal. hāll ‘front’ < PT *āl- < PA *āla; Khal. hēǯäš ‘anger’ < PT *ȫč < PA *ṓč ̔é; Khal. hāla-bula ‘variegated’ < PT *āla < PA *lV; Khal. āč ‘hunger’ < PT *č < PA *ēč ̔o; Khal. hat ‘horse’ < PT *at < PA *atV; Khal. hoqlaɣo ‘bow’ < PT *ok- < PA *k ̔à; Khal. häjlä‘sieve’ < PT *ĕlge- < PA *algi; Khal. hāra ‘space between’ < PT *āra < PA *rV; Khal. haz ‘few’ < PT *āŕ < PA *āŕa; Khal. häps- ‘to winnow’ < PT *ebs- < PA *eba; Khal. hoqu- ‘to call’ < PT *ok- < PA *oki; Khal. hottuz ‘thirty’ < PT *otuŕ < PA *ŋ[u]-. One may note that this prothetic h- is very frequent before long vowels and before the following -j-, -v-. However, the rules are not strict, and in general the emergence of h- in Khalaj is unpredictable. Absence of h- in Khalaj is therefore an almost certain sign of *0- (or *ŋ-) in Altaic, but its presence may be original or secondary. We shall thus continue to use PT forms without initial *h- (keeping in mind though



28 INTRODUCTION
that it was probably present in the system) - given that the reconstruction of *h- can be made only on Khalaj data, and the latter is often quite ambiguous.
2.1.2. PA non-initial *-p ̔
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *p ̔ *p *h (*w),b / -b
*p *p *p
Notes. Japanese can occasionally have -m- before the following nasal, cf. *t ̔p ̔o > *túmá- ( = PT *tubńa- < *tupńa-).
The PM consonant *-h- in intervocalic position is traditionally romanized as -ɣ-, because it is not orthographically distinguished from -g- (or -G-, also romanized as -ɣ-). In order not to depart from tradition too much, we shall write -g- for -g- (“non-vanishing” -g-) and -ɣ- for -h(“vanishing” -g-), even though phonetically it was most probably -h(perhaps voiced -ɦ-) in Middle Mongolian. It should also be noted that Mongolian did not tolerate *-h- (-ɣ-) in front of -i-: in this position it always has -j-. Sometimes -j- also appears instead of *-h- (-ɣ-) before -e-. Mongolian preserves non-initial *p ̔ as b in syllable-final position and in clusters with resonants. In intervocalic position it exhibits a variation of *-h- (sometimes with a preservation of the labial feature, *-hw- = -w-) and *-b-. Japanese usually preserves *-p ̔- as -p-, but (as in case of other aspirated and voiced stops) reveals occasional cases of secondary voiced or prenasalized *-(m)p-. It turns out that there is a fairly good correlation between Mong. *-h- and Jpn. *-p-, on the one hand, and Mong. *-b- and Jpn. -mp-, on the other. Here is a complete correlation chart:

30 INTRODUCTION
PA Mong. Jpn. *t ̔p ̔e *tübü- (but also *túmpú*teɣe-, *teji-) *t ̔óp ̔ú *tobid *túmpúa *t ̔op ̔u *toburu- *tùmpú-ra
There are several cases of Mong. -b- : Jpn. -p- after Jpn. initial *p-: apparently in this position prenasalization did not occur. Cf.:
PA Mong. Jpn. *ĕp ̔a *ebej *pàpà *p ̔ép ̔a *haba-kai *pápái *p ̔ṓp ̔[a] *jabu- *pápúr
There are some exceptions, most of them allowing for an explanation: 1. PA *p ̔o > Mong. aba-rga, but Jpn. *p-. Jpn. *p- ‘big’ may in fact belong to another root, cf. TM *ebi- ‘to be satiated, enough’. 2. PA *gṓp ̔e > Mong. gübege, but Jpn. *kəp(u)i. Jpn. *kəp(u)i ‘swelling of feet’ may in fact, together with *kpà- ‘hard, strong’ reflect a different Altaic root *k ̔àpe ‘strong; to swell’ (cf. TM *xabul- ‘swell’), or at least may have been influenced by this root phonetically. 3. PA *k ̔ap ̔e > Mong. kibe, but Jpn. *kpr(n)kí: an example of “Lyman’s law”, prohibiting two voiced (prenasalized) consonants within one root in Japanese. 4. PA *k ̔p ̔o > Mong. kajila-, but Jpn. *kmpr-. Here Mong. kajila- ‘melt’ was probably influenced by kajira- ‘burn, roast’. 5. PA *làjp ̔V > Mong. *niɣa-, but Jpn. nàimpàr-. Irregular development in this case was probably caused by the cluster -jp ̔- (perhaps the same in 6 and 7?) 6. PA *sp ̔i > Mong. siɣu-, but Jpn. *sìmpàr-. Jpn. *sìmpàr- ‘tie, bind’ may be actually a combined reflex of PA *sp ̔i, *sbi and *špo, all distinguished only in the Western Altaic branch. 7. PA *ǯip ̔o > Mong. *ǯiɣar, but Jpn. *(d)impu-s-. We see that the exceptions are both few and dubious, while the evidence in favour of Mong. *-h- : Jpn. *-p- and Mong. *-b- : Jpn. *-mp- is rather strong. One would be tempted to reconstruct two different phonemes here, but this is probably not the best solution, since there exist two other rows of correspondences (for PA *-p- and *-b- respectively), and there is no trace of evidence in favour of the existence of four series of stops in Altaic. The explanation here is perhaps prosodic. Already Poppe in his “Introduction” noticed the split in Mongolian and put forward a hypothe



CHAPTER TWO 31
sis that the reason for the split may have been accentological, something like Verner’s law causing voicing of *-p- (in our reconstruction, *-p ̔-), e.g., in a stressed position. The idea was at that time purely hypothetical, since there was nothing to prove or disprove it. But if we look at the charts above, we may notice that, although exceptions are rather many, there is in Japanese a general tendency for words in type 1 to have low pitch on the syllable with -p- (cf. *tpî, *kùpà-, *kàpì, *kp-, *pùkùpùkù-si, *tpr-), and in type 2 to have high pitch on the syllable with *-mp- (cf. *tùmpá-mái, *ámpárá, *kámpú, *kìmpí, *sìmpá, *sìmpái, *símpm-, *túmpú-, *túmpúa, *tùmpú-ra). Pitch, especially on non-initial syllables, is not always reconstructable, and certainly was subject to a lot of secondary influences (analogical, morphological etc.). Nevertheless, the correlation seems significant and may help us reconstruct prosodic characteristics of non-initial syllables in Proto-Altaic (on the better known prosody of the initial syllables see below). It is therefore highly probable that PA possessed some prosodic distinction on the second syllable (pitch or perhaps vowel length) that caused voicing of *-p ̔- > *-b- in Mongolian and prenasalization (probably initially through gemination *-p ̔- > *-pp- > *-mp-) in Proto-Japanese. Mongolian has not preserved traces of this feature elsewhere; Japanese, however, demonstrates its effects in every series of stops, not only labials. See more on that below. Examples for medial *-p ̔- can be found in following entries of the dictionary: *áp ̔a, *ap ̔akV, *č ̔ăp ̔a, *č ̔ap ̔i, *č ̔ep ̔à, *č ̔ḗp ̔u, *č ̔p ̔ì, *č ̔íp ̔ú, *č ̔p ̔[ú], *č ̔op ̔è, *č ̔p ̔a, *č ̔op ̔a, *č ̔p ̔a, *č ̔op ̔i, *č ̔up ̔V, *dĕp ̔a, *dup ̔ú, *ĕp ̔a, *ép ̔á, *ep ̔ò, *p ̔o, *ép ̔V, *gàp ̔á, *gep ̔V, *gṓp ̔e, *gp ̔a, *góp ̔á, *gṓp ̔i, *ap ̔i, *ăp ̔u, *ap ̔u, *op ̔érV, *kăp ̔è, *kìp ̔é, *kìp ̔í, *kḗp ̔à, *kḗp ̔V, *kap ̔a, *kàp ̔ù, *kùp ̔u, *kùp ̔ù, *kŏp ̔é, *kŏp ̔V, *kṓp ̔i, *kùp ̔Ỻ, *kup ̔e, *k[ā]p ̔á, *k ̔ăp ̔ù, *k ̔àp ̔à, *k ̔ap ̔u, *k ̔ap ̔V, *k ̔p ̔à, *k ̔āp ̔a, *k ̔àp ̔e, *k ̔p ̔ó, *k ̔ep ̔orV, *k ̔p ̔è, *k ̔p ̔a, *k ̔óp ̔e, *k ̔up ̔e, *kúĺap ̔V, *k ̔p ̔e, *k ̔óp ̔ì, *k ̔óp ̔i, *k ̔óp ̔ìra, *láp ̔ì, *ĺp ̔o, *ĺp ̔V, *ĺep ̔a, *lép ̔ó, *ĺip ̔ú, *lap ̔V, *làp ̔[à], *ĺp ̔ù, *lop ̔V, *np ̔é, *nep ̔V(ĺV), *op ̔á(rV), *p ̔ìkV, *op ̔V, *ṓp ̔à, *ṓp ̔V, *ṓp ̔V, *pép ̔à, *p ̔ăp ̔a, *p ̔ap ̔o, *p ̔ép ̔a, *p ̔ṓp ̔[á], *sắp ̔í, *sằp ̔í, *săp ̔í, *sàp ̔ì, *sep ̔a, *sèp ̔ó, *sèp ̔ù, *sắp ̔ú, *sp ̔í, *sp ̔è, *sŏp ̔u, *sṓp ̔ì, *sp ̔í, *šĭp ̔V, *šop ̔a, *šúp ̔ù, *sép ̔à, *šop ̔é, *tp ̔V, *tp ̔é, *tp ̔e, *t ̔áp ̔à, *t ̔ằp ̔è, *t ̔op ̔è, *t ̔ăp ̔o(rV), *t ̔èp ̔à, *t ̔ep ̔V, *t ̔ĕp ̔á, *t ̔ep ̔à, *t ̔p ̔a, *t ̔p ̔é, *t ̔op ̔u, *t ̔up ̔i, *t ̔p ̔o, *t ̔óp ̔ú, *t ̔op ̔u, *t ̔òp ̔ú, *t ̔p ̔i, *ùp ̔í, *zep ̔i, *ǯap ̔ù, *ǯp ̔V, *ǯip ̔o, *ǯip ̔u, *ǯap ̔e, *ǯòp ̔è, *ǯap ̔V(ĺV).



32 INTRODUCTION
2.1.3. PA initial *p
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *p- *b- *b-,h- *p- *p- *p
Notes. Mongolian has here variation between b- (in the majority of cases) and *h- (less frequently, but still in a sufficient amount of cases). Here, too, we may note a dependence of the distribution on prosodic factors. a) before an original long vowel (on their reconstruction see below) Mongolian always has *b-: *pjku > *beg-, *plča > *balči-, *pli > *bilaɣu, *pli > *belčir, *pt ̔e > *batagana, *pḗk ̔o > *baka-, *pḗŕV > *berseɣü, *pḕǯo > *böǯi, *pt ̔e > *bat-, *pṓro > *burga-, *pōto > *bodu-, *pṓt ̔o > *buta, *pge > *bug, *pūsa > *busu.
The only exception is the root *pne ‘to ride’, where Mong. has a strange variation between *hunu- and *unu-, so far unexplained. b) before a vowel with high pitch Mongolian always has *b-: *pắda > *bad-, *pélaba(nV) > *barimal, *pép ̔a > *baɣa-su, *píla > *bila-, *píńŋe > *beɣer, *pắlagV > *balaga-, *plo > *boli-, *pltorV > *bolǯir-, *póso > *bosuga, *pk ̔i > *böküne, *pgi(-rV) > *böɣere, *pótirkV > *büdürkei, *púla > *bul-, *púre > *bor-.
c) before a short vowel with low pitch Mongolian usually has *h-: *pka > *(h)agi, *pk ̔e > *hok-tal-, *plǯi > *(h)ilǯi, *pằt ̔e > *hataɣa, *psa > *hesi.
There are two exceptions here, both probably explainable: 1. *pč ̔a ‘to tear, split, cut’ > Mong. *biči, *bičal-; the root is expressive and its prosodic characteristics are not quite firmly established. 2. *pru ‘to snow, rain’ > Mong. boruɣa. The root is very close to *bru ‘smoke, whirlwind’ ( > Mong. bur-gi-), and could have been easily influenced by it. It seems thus that in this case, too, the Mongolian split was caused by prosodic factors. Moreover, it is difficult to separate the two d escribed processes: split of medial *-p ̔- and of initial *p- in Mongolian. We can put forward the following explanation. The process *p ̔- > *h- must have already happened very early, since it is common both to Turkic and Mongolian, probably in the common Turko-Mongolian protolanguage, and, as is often the case, triggered a series of further changes. Thus, Proto-Turko-Mongolian reduced the three-way distinction of *p ̔-*p-*b in initial position to a two-way distinction *p-*b (although word-medially and in other local series the three-way distinction was kept, see below). After the split of



CHAPTER TWO 33
Turko-Mongolian Turkic merged *p and *b into one voiced phoneme *b, both initially and medially. Mongolian, however, had a slightly more complicated development. The first change here was that of *-b- > *-w- (except in clusters, see below); next medial *-p- > -b-, just as in Turkic: we shall see below that PA *-p- and *-b- develop in different ways in Mongolian, which means that they had not merged early. In this way Mongolian also arrived at a two-way distinction *p-*b (in medial position phonetically it was rather *p ̔-*b), but in a fashion different from that of Turkic. As seen from the above, Proto-Mongolian must have had some pitch distinctions that later became lost. It probably had high pitch on initial syllables with original vowel length (independently of tone) and on initial syllables with short vowels, but original high tone. It also had high pitch on non-initial syllables corresponding (at least partly) to high pitch in Japanese. Whether this high pitch reflects original high tone or vowel length on non-initial syllables is yet to be established. The process that happened afterwards can be described as follows: early Proto-Mongolian *p changed into *b in syllables with high pitch. Finally, the rest of the instances of *p which were all probably aspirated ( = *p ̔) by that time, changed to *f and then to *h, both initially and medially.
2.1.4 PA non-initial *p
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *p *b *b *b *p *p
Notes. As we have said above, Turkic and Mongolian had a process of voicing *-p- > *-b-, although this voicing probably occurred independently. Tungus-Manchu also underwent the same process. PA *-p- is generally reconstructed on the basis of Mong. *-b- (not changing to *-h-, as PA *-b-, see below) and Kor. *-p-. Note that such a behaviour of *-p- in Korean differs from *-t- and *-k- (which are normally reflected as *-d- > -r- and *-g- > -0-) and means that medial *-p- in Korean had early merged with voiceless *-p ̔-. In Japanese *-p-, like other voiceless unaspirated stops, is not subject to prenasalization ( < *gemination), as was shown by I. Gruntov. An only exception is noticed in a root with an initial voiceless aspirated *t ̔-, which means that an early assimilation *C ̔VCV > *C ̔VC ̔V was operating in Japanese. Cf.: PA *t ̔ḕpa > *t ̔ḕp ̔a > PJ *tàmpá.



34 INTRODUCTION
Occasionally one can also meet Jpn. -m- < *-p- before the following nasal, cf. *dpà > *dàmà ( = Mong. *daba-ɣan); *lépù > *númà ( = PTM *lebē-n).
Examples for PA *p can be found in the following entries: *àpo, *apuči, *apV, *pi, *č ̔ipV, *č ̔upa, *dpà, *ḗpo, *gúpu, *ipe, *òpe, *ằpV, *upo, *kăpi, *kĕpV, *kēpu, *kàpì, *kopu, *kòpù, *kopV, *k ̔àpe, *k ̔ápa, *k ̔apV, *k ̔èpà, *k ̔èpù, *ńipV, *ńṑpo, *ŋúpu, *papi, *p ̔ṑpo, *sápa, *sapV, *sĕpo, *sepV, *sípa, *spi, *sìpò, *sipV, *spe, *spe, *sipa, *špo, *tapV, *t ̔ápỼ, *t ̔ḕpá, *zīpe, *zupi, *ǯape.
2.1.5 PA initial *b
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *b- *b- *b- *b- *p- *p- / *b[a,ə,Vj]
Notes. Initial *b- is usually well preserved in Turkic, Mongolian and Tungus-Manchu. In Korean it was devoiced like all voiced consonants in general and merged with *p- and *p ̔-. The most tricky reflex of *b- is found in Japanese, where three rules regulate its development: 1. PA *b- > Jpn. p- before all voiceless aspirated consonants: *bằt ̔i > *pìntì, *bk ̔u > *pukusi, *bek ̔u > *punku, *bt ̔e > *pútá, *bṓrk ̔i > *púk-, *buk ̔e > *pùkùmpái, *bt ̔u > *pùt-, *bk ̔i > *pìnkàm-, *bt ̔e > *pntk-, *buč ̔o > *pətəpər-.
2. PA *b- > Jpn. *p- before *i and *u: *balu > *puruki, *bằŕ[i] > *pìr-, *bási > *písák-, *bdi > *pitapi, *bri > *pìtà, *bdu > *pùtuà-, *bēǯu > *piji-nta- ( ~ pui-), *bắĺmi > *pínsá, *bălu > *pu-, *bŏŕu > *pítú-nsi, *bási > *písásí, *bgi > *pìja-, *bogo > *pia, *bli-t ̔i > *píntì, *bor[a] > *púrí, *bṓr[e] > *pírí-p-, *budu > *pí-n-kai, *bùdo > *pùjà-kà, *bugu > *pu, *blo > *pùr, *buri > *pitə, *būgi > *pìw-musi, *bŏgdu > *puti, *bku > *pùkù-m-, *bŏĺi > *pusi, *bli > *púr-, *bĺi > *pùsì, *bằlu > *pùrù-.
3. PA *b- > Jpn. *b- before low vowels and before the following *j: *bắja > *bái-m-, *bèka > *bàkà, *bằka > *bàkàr-, *bằka > *bàká-, *bašo > *basi-r-, *bằto > *bàtà, *b > *bə, *bāla > *bàràpai, *bāŕa > *báráp-, *b > *bá-i, *bje > *b, *béjo > *bí ( ~ *bi), *bre > *bt-, *b (*ba) > *bà-, *bíju > *bú(i)-, *bĺča > *bánsá-, *bga > *bà, *bla > *bàrà-mpì, *bólo > *brì, *bòsa > *bàsái, *bóju > *bíjá, *búga > *bà, *bujri > *bì, *bka > *bàkì, *bòda > *bàtà, *bde > *bntr-, *bka > *bàkù, *bke > *bkás-, *bójĺo > *bsí-p-, *bóra > *bár-, *borso(k ̔V) > *bsákí, *bṓlo > *br-, *bùjre > *bàr-, *búĺa > *básurá-, *bĺo > *bsì-, *bùro > *br-, *bŋe- > *bamia-.



CHAPTER TWO 35
There are four exceptions, where Jpn. for an unknown reason has voiceless *p- instead of the expected *b-: PA *bằǯa > *pàjá; PA *blo > *pàrá-; PA *bura > *para-p-; PA *bte > *pàtákài. The overwhelming majority of cases, however, follows the established rules quite strictly. Note that this split must have happened rather late in the history of Japanese (but before the reconstructed Proto-Japanese period), because it depends on PJ vowels, already after a whole series of transformations that they underwent after PJ split from Proto-Altaic (see below on the vocalism). The phonetic reasons here are not easy to discover. It is possible that what we reconstruct as PJ *b was in fact a fricative *b (in Old Japanese it is actually w-, but most Ryukyu dialects have the value b-). In that case we may think that the original *b weakened into *b before low vowels, but preserved its stopped articulation *b before more tense high vowels *i and *u, after which *b was devoiced into *p. The effect of *-j- (in cases like *biju > *bu(i), *bóju > *bija, *bujri > *bi) deserves special attention, because this is very similar to what happened in Japanese with intervocalic *-b-, *-d- and *-g- (that changed to fricatives after --diphthongs, see below). The following *-j- must have had a palatalizing effect on *b-, so it changed to *- (or *) and subsequently escaped the general process of devoicing *b > *p. The process of fricativizing *b- > *b- probably took place also in some archaic Korean dialects, which explains why in a few cases Korean also has 0- ( < *w-) as a reflex of PA *b-. Unlike Japanese, however, these cases are very few, which means that the standard dialect where *b- > *p- in the long run prevailed. The probable cases with *b- > 0- in Korean are: PA *b ‘I, we’ > Kor. *úrí ‘we’ ( = PT *bi-ŕ) PA *bujri ‘spring, well’ > Kor. *ù- in *ù-mr id. (*mr ‘water’) PA *borso(k ̔V) ‘badger’ > Kor. *ùsrk id. PA *bùjre ‘wrong, bad’ > Kor. *ōi- id. PA *bíju ‘to be’ > Kor. *ì- id.

Notes. In all languages, in addition to normal reflexes, we may observe weakened reflexes (-j-, in clusters also -0- in Turkic, -j-, -w- in Mong., -0in Korean, -0- in clusters in TM, -0- (usually after -u- or -j-) in Japanese). It is quite probable that *-b- had an allophonic variant *-w- already in Proto-Altaic, but there seems to be not enough evidence to reconstruct a distinction between *-b- and *-w-. Mong. normally has *-b- > -h-, but preserves -b- after resonants (see below). Thus in a few cases when Mong. has intervocalic -b- and Jpn. has -w-/-j- (which is the normal reflex after -i-diphthongs) and Kor. has -b-, it seems appropriate to reconstruct the cluster *-jb-. These are the cases: PA *ằjbo : Mong. ebe-sü, Jpn. *àw- (here *-j- is also responsible for the fronting *a > e in Mong.)
PA *ḗjba : Mong. *(h)abad, Jpn. *áwá-táPA *kejbe : Mong. *keb-te-, *kebiji-, Jpn. *kəjə-, Kor. *kìbúrPA *kójbu : Mong. *kubakaj, Jpn. *kúi PA *t ̔ḕjbo : Mong. *tabi-, Kor. *tằbiPA *t ̔ujbu : Mong. *tobi-, Jpn. *tuà (here *-j- is actually preserved in TM *tujba-)
PA *jba : Mong. *ibil-, Jpn. *àwà PA *ǯjbe : Mong. *ǯoba-, Jpn. *duàwà-, Kor. *čubɨr-.
There is another important group of cases where Mongolian preserves intervocalic -b- rather than changing it to *-h- (-ɣ-). This is the position of -b- before the following vowel + g, h (=ɣ). Cf.:
PA *ĺabo > Mong. *debeɣe PA *sábo > Mong. *sibe-gčin PA *sebVnV > Mong. *sebe-ɣün PA *sibo > Mong. *sibaga PA *sìbi > Mong. *sibag PA *tbulka > Mong. *čibaga



CHAPTER TWO 37
PA *t ̔ba > Mong. *tabag PA *ǯebi > Mong. *ǯibe-ɣü PA *săbi > Mong. siböge
In all of these cases we can neither reconstruct *-p ̔- (there is either a Turkic or TM form with *-b-), nor *-p- (there is voicing > *-mp- in Japanese, or Korean has *-b-), nor *-jb- (Japanese does not have -w-), so that the only solution is reconstructing *-b- with the mentioned positional condition. We see that, unlike the case of -*p ̔-, the split of *-b- into *-h- and *-bin Proto-Mongolian has nothing to do with prosody, being rather triggered by the “velar dissimilation rule”. Let us now look at the rules of split in Japanese. Here, too, we have a double reflex: stop (prenasalized or not - on this distinction see below) and resonant (fricative) *-w- (in some cases -j- or -0-, depending evidently on the vocalic environment). As was stated in Starostin 1997, the conditions of this split are purely vocalic: *-w- emerges after original diphthongs with --. Cf.:
a) PA *čằba > PJ *tàpàra; PA *č ̔abu > *tupa-; PA *ĕba > PJ *àpù-; PA *be > PJ *p-; PA *ebi > PJ *impu-sia-; PA *gbe > PJ *kp-; PA *kabari > PJ *kapiara; PA *kábo > PJ *kámpiá; PA *kéba > PJ *kápí; PA *kbu > PJ *kúmpuá; PA *kúbe > PJ *kuámp-; PA *k ̔éba > PJ *kápà; PA *k ̔ibu > PJ *kúpá; PA *k ̔òbani > PJ *kàpìná; PA *k ̔íba > PJ *kápiàru(n)tai; PA *làbo > PJ *nàp; PA *labV > PJ *nàp-; PA *ĺabo > PJ *náimpú; PA *nébi > PJ *nípí-; PA *sắbi > PJ *símpí; PA *sábo > PJ *sámpúrap-; PA *sāba > PJ *sàmpàk-; PA *sìbi > PJ *sìmpù-; PA *tằba > PJ *tàpì; PA *t ̔ba > PJ *tàmp(u)î; PA *t ̔éba > PJ *támpì; PA *t ̔ḕba > PJ *tapasir-; PA *t ̔úbe > PJ *tuámpí ( ~ -ə-); PA *ǯebo > PJ *dapara-; PA *tbu > *tùmpúnai; b) PA *č ̔be > PJ *tùwái; PA *gube > PJ *kuwa-; PA *gūbe > PJ *káwr; PA *ùbu > PJ *ùwá; PA *k ̔ŏbe > PJ *kua; PA *k ̔ube > PJ *kwâi; PA *ŋàbi > PJ *muà ( ~ *m); PA *pbi > PJ *piwa-; PA *sbu > PJ *súwá-i; PA *ǯaba > PJ *duá-mp- ( < *dawV-mp-).
We know only one exception: PA *šábu > PJ *súmp-. This root is very sparsely represented in Turkic and TM languages, so that the vowel reconstruction is not quite secure (but PJ *súmp- in this case can actually be a secondary contraction < *suwu-mp- and thus conform to the general rule). Note that in all these cases plain vowels and diphthongs are reconstructed independently of the Japanese evidence, and the distribution is rather apparent. Since in many cases — especially when there is no TM evidence— it is rather difficult to distinguish reflexes of plain vow

els from those of diphthongs, the Japanese distinction of *-p- vs. *-wmay actually help to reconstruct the vocalism. Such are the cases: (with plain vowels):

(and with diphthongs): PA *čobe > PJ *təwə; PA *čobeŕV > PJ *túrá-; PA *úb[u] > PJ *úwa-; PA *lùbu > PJ *nì (*nùi); PA *k ̔óbarV > PJ *káwá(ra)-k-; PA *k ̔ubu > PJ *k(u)i; PA *šábu > PJ *súwá-; PA *sbo > PJ *sàwuà; PA *šóbi > PJ *síwá; PA *ǯúbu > PJ *dúwài.
Japanese also regularly has *-w- or *-j- as a reflex of PA *-jb- (reconstructed on the basis of TM *-jb- or Mong. -b-, that has not shifted to -ɣ-, see above): PA *ằjbo > PJ *àw-; PA *jbi > PJ *û; PA *ḗjba > PJ *áwá-tá-; PA *kejbe > PJ *kəjə-; PA *kójbu > PJ *kúi; PA *pjbu > PJ *pùjà-; PA *t ̔ujbu > PJ *tuà; PA *jba > PJ *àwà; PA *ǯjbe > PJ *duàwà-.
The phonetic source of this distribution is probably the same as of initial *b- > *w- before the following *j (see above). Voiced consonants must have been palatalized in early Proto-Japanese after original *-diphthongs and these palatalized allophones (probably because they
were also fricativized: *-- > *b, *-- > *-δ-, *-ǵ- > *-ɣ-; on the development of dentals and velars see below) later escaped the general process of devoicing of stops. We may note that here too Japanese has quite a number of cases with prenasalized *-mp- among stop reflexes of *b. This may mean that, unlike Mongolian where only voiceless *p was voiced in certain pitch environments, Japanese carried this process throughout the whole system of voiceless aspirated and voiced stops; see more on this below.

Notes. In general, the correspondences here are quite straightforward, except for the Turkic development *m- > *b-.



CHAPTER TWO 39
Here we should perhaps answer (belatedly) Doerfer’s critique in TMN which maintained (p. 60): “es ist nicht bewiesen, daß einem mo. m- ein tü. b- (oder irgend ein anderer Laut) entspricht, für mo. m(außer bei Nasalen) findet sich im Tü. kein einziges Vergleichswort.” If this were the case, it would indeed be an argument against the relationship of Turkic and Mongolian. But is it? Doerfer examines only six cases taken out of KW: 1. Mong. miqan ‘meat’ - Turk. *bɨkɨn ‘thigh’. This etymology seems incorrect to us, too (on Mong. miqan see PA *mék ̔u, on Turk. *bɨkɨn see PA *bk ̔a)
2. Mong. mačaɣ ‘fast’ - Turk. *bačag id. Doerfer says that “Nach Gabain 1950, 300b ist atü. bačaɣ ein Lehnwort aus dem Sogd.”. But Sogdian does not have anything similar. The only proposed Sogdian match was p’šyk ‘hymn’, which even Clauson in his dictionary rejected as extremely implausible (and concluded that *bačag is a genuine Turkic word). On the other hand, we have in Manchu the verb maču- ‘to lose weight’ and the noun mačixi ‘fast’, which can hardly be explained as borrowed from Mong. < Turkic (especially because of the verb which is absent in these subgroups). Finally, we have Jpn. mátúr- ‘to celebrate, worship’ which makes the common Altaic nature of the root rather plausible, exactly with the meaning “to fast, hunger with religious purposes” (see *máč ̔a). 3. Mong. ma, me, turk. mä ‘take!’ - correctly dismissed as a ‘Lallwort’. 4. Mong. majiɣaq ‘clubfooted’ - Turk. *bań- ‘to bow’. Here several things should be said. The Mong. word, actually only Kalmuck, is most probably borrowed from Turkic, cf. forms like Uzb. bajmaq, Kaz. bajnaŋda- etc. The Turkic root *bań-, however, means ‘clubfooted’ only in derivatives, and does not mean ‘to bow’ at all. The attested meanings are rather ‘to sway’ or ‘collapse’ (with this meaning we have in Old Turkic majɨš-), and it corresponds quite well to WMong. mai-mari- ‘to sway, walk swayingly’. Doerfer says: “Mo. *mayi- und tü. *bañ- wären aber nicht vergleichbar”. Why? The transfer of nasalization to *-j- is a quite regular process in Turkic (and, on the other hand, the correspondence Turk. *-ń- : Mong. *-j- is also quite regular), so there seems to be nothing against this comparison, although in a shape distinct from the one proposed by Ramstedt. See PA *meju (with further TM and Korean parallels). 5. Mong. metü ‘like, similar’ - Turk. bet ‘face’. Doerfer does not like the semantic side of the comparison. We can only say that the change ‘face’ > ‘compare, similar’ is fairly common (cf. Russ. lico ‘face’, sličat’ ‘to compare’; Turkic beŋiz- and beŋze- - on which see below etc.). That ‘face’ was the original meaning here is also corroborated



40 INTRODUCTION
by the TM parallel, *miata ‘skin from animal’s head’ (the semantics here is quite straightforward, and we still have *m- corresponding to Turkic *b-). See PA *mat ̔i. 6. Mong. mögersün ‘cartilage’ - *bujŋuŕ (*büjŋüŕ) ‘horn’. Again, Doerfer does not like the semantic side, and again we must say that the change ‘horn’ <> ‘cartilage’ does not seem strange at all to us (‘horn’ is frequently associated with horny matter, callosities and various bones).
Doerfer says further: “Nun gibt es aber kein Lautgesetz mo. -g- = Turk. -ŋ-“. This is typical for his system of criticism: first he criticizes the “Lautgesetze” put forward by Ramstedt and Poppe, and then he declines the parallels because they do not follow those “Lautgesetze”. You cannot have it both ways: either the phonetic rules are wrong, in which case no comparison is possible at all until new rules are found, or you accept the system of rules and therefore the comparisons on which they are based. The correspondence between Mong. -ɣ- (-w-) and Turk. -ŋ- ( < PA *-ŋ-) is in fact quite common, see in the dictionary: *ăŋu, *ēŋV, *găŋi, *goŋV(ŕV) [about which Doerfer also says: “aus lautlichen Gründen mindestens unwahrscheinlich”)], *maŋi (by the way, also with *m-:*b-), *ńaŋo, *nắŋe, *nŋu, *siŋra, *sìŋu, *soŋre, *tuŋa etc.
Doerfer proceeds to say: “Von dieser Art nun sind alle Beispiele, die Ramstedt (und Poppe 1960, 34-6) bringt, stets handelt es sich um Lallwörter, Onomatopoetika, semantisch oder lautgesetzlich nicht einwandfreie Gleichungen usw.” We could say that all Doerfer’s criticism is of this sort. He may notice mistakes and wrong comparisons (as in 1 and 4), but his entire spirit is set on discrediting the theory. To be sure, there are very many faulty comparisons in Ramstedt’s and Poppe’s papers, but instead of trying to correct the etymologies and widen the scope of comparison, he restricts himself to picking at the Turkic and Mongolian parallels and enjoying every vulnerable one of them. Now back to *m- > Turkic *b-. Besides the above cases, the following instances of Turkic *b- < PA *m- can be found: Turk. *bAńɨ- ‘to fade away, disappear, weaken’ : Mong. *maɣu ‘bad’: TM *maja- ‘to fail, be unsuccessful’ < PA *maja Turk. *baj ( ~ -ń) ‘holy, God’ : TM *maji-n ‘protecting spirit’: OJ mji id. < PA *maji

We have only included here (as Doerfer demanded) examples reflected in Old Turkic. Some of these etymologies are new, but some are well known in the literature (like *mása > Turk. *bAsa, *mĺǯu > Turk. *baĺč [which Doerfer omitted from his “short list”, but elsewhere - TMN 2, 253 - mentions briefly as “unklar”], *mk ̔o, *màĺa, *muŋo, *mŏjno, *mṓli, *múgda, *múnu, *mt ̔i, *mṓča). To be sure, not all of them would pass the test of Ramstedt’s and Poppe’s correspondences, especially in



CHAPTER TWO 43
the field of vocalism; but as we intend to show, their correspondences were actually too simplified and it is of course impossible to stuff all the really existing parallels into their Procrustean bed. But instead of trying to reevaluate the system of correspondences, Doerfer and other critics used them rigidly with the single purpose of dismantling the Altaic theory. This lengthy passage may have little value in and of itself, but we wanted to dwell on this particular correspondence in detail to show the reader the sort of anti-Altaic criticism that has nearly ruined the whole field of studies.

Notes. Non-initial *m, like initial *m, is generally well preserved. The only exception are several cases where it (like all other resonants except *ĺ and *ŕ) disappears in Japanese. Cf.: PA *čùmi > PJ *ti



44 INTRODUCTION
PA *ĺmo(ŋa) > PJ *ná(N) ‘name’ (with the Hateruma dialect possibly still preserving a trace of the nasal as nàN ‘name’; note that the verbal root *nəm- ‘to pray’ still preserves *m) PA *súme > PJ *sua PA *t ̔mV > PJ *tù
We should first note that there are only nominal stems in this list. Verbs never behave like this (except for two or three very archaic and probably originally monosyllabic roots — see above on root structure). A suggestion put forward in Starostin 1997 was that we are dealing here with the working of an archaic nominal suffix (or several suffixes) like *ga, perhaps also *ŋa - actually, quite common, e. g., in Turkic and Mongolian, so that, e.g. *súme-ga > *súmga > *súga, and, with final dropping of -g- > *sua. However, we shall see below that *-g- could disappear only in a position after a diphthong, so the proposed rule has to be slightly modified. The diphthongs indeed had a palatalizing and fricativizing effect on the following voiced stops, but those were only stops of the second syllable (since diphthongs could occur only in the first syllable of the root). It seems probable, however, that voiced consonants in the third syllable were always fricativized (and, as a consequence, usually dropped) in early Japanese. This would explain a large proportion of nouns whose Auslaut can only be explained as a result of contraction - i.e. nouns in *-ai, *-ia and *-ua in PJ (all these sequences do not occur or occur only very rarely in the first syllable of a polysyllabic root). We can now formulate the following hypothesis about prehistoric Japanese: any resonant preceding the weakened *-ɣ- in the third syllable was also weakened and dropped, together with the following vowel, viz.: *CVRVɣV > *CVRɣV > *CVɣV. On the other hand, *CVCVɣV > *CVCV. This would account for the so called “-r-loss” observed by Martin and Whitman in their Korean-Japanese comparison (“-r-loss” is the most frequent phenomenon, but there certainly is also “-l-loss” , “-m-loss” and “-ŋ-loss” in Japanese). Among the words listed above we can only find the word for “name” with the suffix *ŋV, which is quite clearly seen, e.g. in Evk. nim-ŋā-n- ‘to shamanize’, nim-ŋā-kān ‘fairy-tale’. It seems therefore probable that in Proto-Japanese *ĺmo-ŋa > *nmɣa > *nõɣa > *ná(N). This word is further interesting because it may also accept a second velar suffix *-k ̔V (originally, probably, diminutive), cf. TM *nimŋākā-n = Turk. *jom(ŋ)ak = Mong. *domag. The Kor. parallel is also known and it is MKor. nì’jàkì ‘tale’. Now it seems that the Kor. form also reflects a common PKJ form like *nomɣa-kV, with a development *-mɣ- > -‘- very



CHAPTER TWO 45
similar to Japanese. This would date the first part of the process we are describing (*CVRVɣV > *CVRɣV) to the common Korean- Japanese period. But unlike Japanese, Korean did not usually drop the resonant instead, it dropped the *-ɣ- (sometimes, perhaps preserving it as -h-, see below) and the final vowel. The resonant is dropped in this case because a second suffix was added and the combination *-mɣ- turned out to be located in an intervocalic position. More on this interesting Japanese development will follow, in notes on other PA resonants.
2.1.9 PA initial *t ̔
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *t ̔- *t- [dV+ĺ,ŕ,r] *t- / č[i] *t- *t- *t
Notes In the vast majority of cases where the difference between *t- and *d- can be established (i.e. when the Oghuz reflexes are present), Turkic has *t-. Voiced *d- emerges, however, almost exceptionlessly when this consonant is followed by *ĺ: cf. PT *dȫĺ < PA *t ̔ōĺi, PT *dǖĺ < PA *t ̔ūĺke, PT *dūĺ < PA *t ̔ūĺi, PT *d(i)āĺ- < PA *t ̔āĺke (cf., however, *taĺak < *t ̔aĺp ̔V). Less systematic is the behaviour of *t ̔- in front of the following *ŕ and *r: we have *torgaj, *tōŕ, *tōrum, *turup / *turum, *tor, *tēŕ, *töŕ / *törü, *ter, *terkü, *terk-, *törpigü, *töre, *teŕek as opposed to *dīŕ (but with suffixation: *tir-sgek), *dīre-, *da(:)ŕ. There is also a tendency of voicing *t- > *d- before *-b- (in *debe  ̔camel’ < *t ̔ĭbŋe, *debir-  ̔to capsize’ < *t ̔ebV as opposed to *tabɨĺgan < *t ̔ḕba, but even in the latter case cf. secondary voice in Az. dowšan).

Examples of PA *-t ̔- can be found in the following entries: *at ̔i, *bằt ̔í, *bt ̔è, *bt ̔é, *bt ̔ù, *t ̔è, *ḗt ̔a, *gt ̔ì, *get ̔V, *got ̔ò, *gt ̔ù, *t ̔á, *ìt ̔ù, *it ̔VKV, *ṑt ̔íkV, *t ̔e, *kāt ̔e, *két ̔ò, *két ̔ò, *kít ̔u, *kòt ̔è, *kòt ̔e, *kŏt ̔i, *kòt ̔V, *kùt ̔á, *k ̔ét ̔ò, *k ̔ṑt ̔ekV, *k ̔ōt ̔e, *lt ̔á ( ~ ĺ-), *mét ̔i(-rkV), *mét ̔ò, *mat ̔è,

The number of clear cases with *-t ̔- is smaller than of those with *t ̔-, because the reflexes of *-t ̔- are different from those of *-t- only in intervocalic position in Kor. and Mong. (and even in Mong. the two phonemes coincide in the position of palatalization, i.e. before *i). The distinction, however, is indirectly supported by Jpn., where non-initial *t ̔ is subject to secondary voicing (prenasalization), as opposed to PA *t. Cf.:

2.1.11 PA initial *t
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *t- *d- *d- / č[i] *d- /ǯ() *t- *t- / d[i,ə]
Notes. Mong. has č- in the position before -i-, even though the reflexes of *t ̔- and *t- are distinguished in other positions. The only exception is the numeral “two”, where Mong. has ǯiw- / ǯui- - probably because in all other cases the sequence *tV- had first changed to *ti- and then to *či-, whereas here *tu- was preserved longer and finally yielded *du- > *ǯu-.
The TM languages show palatalization in sequences with diphthongs: *ǯola < *tṓĺi, *ǯō(l) < *tṓle, *ǯube < *tubu, *ǯir- < *tāre, whereas the sequence *ti- itself stays intact and yields *di-. Note that this differs from the behaviour of *t ̔- and *d- which never get palatalized in TM.



CHAPTER TWO 47
Japanese has a clearcut distribution here: *t in front of voiceless aspirated consonants and +back *a, *u; *d in front of -back *i, *ə, cf.:

2.1.12 PA non-initial *t

Examples of non-initial *t can be found in the following entries: *ătV, *bằtò, *bté, *čtu, *găte, *gàtù, *ite, *ìtí, *káta, *ktu, *kùtí, *k ̔ta, *k ̔et[o], *mèto, *m[u]ti, *nutu, *pótirkV, *pōto, *p ̔ḗta, *p ̔ḕtá, *p ̔ḗt[e], *sóti, *sata, *sútu, t ̔otá, *t ̔[u]tỺ, *zṓta, *ǯòto, *pti.
Notes. See above (notes to *-t ̔-) for an explanation of the relatively low number of clearly reconstructed *-t ̔- and *-t- (in a great number of cases the two phonemes cannot be distinguishedr). Korean must originally have had *-d- ( > MKor. -r-) in intervocalic position, but *-t in syllable-final position. This is clearly seen in verbal paradigms like mūd- (i.e. mūt- / mūrV-) and tăd- (i.e. tăt- / tărV-), as well as in roots of the CVCV structure, where Korean normally has -r- (pɨrɨ-, čūri-), except for cases where an early vowel reduction in the first syllable occurred (sta(h), ptɨt). Sometimes however the -t-grade was already in MKor. analogically extended to the intervocalic position, and thus we have mit-, tat- without any alternations. No alternations are attested in nominal paradigms, cf. sot, soth with uniform -t-. In Japanese, medial *-t- is never voiced except for a few cases after an original aspirated stop: *p ̔ḕta > *pàntá, *t ̔ota > *tanta-juap-, *t ̔[u]tV > *tntə-, which proves that such roots underwent progressive aspiration in early PJ ( > *p ̔ḕt ̔a, *t ̔ot ̔a, *t ̔[u]t ̔V), after which prenasalization (voicing) became possible.

Notes. In Mong. *d- > *ǯ- in front of the following -i-. Before other vowels palatalization normally does not occur; a few cases like *ǯaha < *dòge and *ǯehü-wün < *dēgni probably reflect a later secondary vowel shift (*ǯiha > *ǯa’a and *ǯihü-wün > *ǯe’ün) in the specific hiatus environment after loss of -h-. In Jpn. there must have been an early devoicing of *d- in front of the following voiceless aspirated consonants: in this position *d- behaves exactly as *t ̔-, i.e. yields voiceless t-. Otherwise it gives a uniform *d-reflex. Here are all the cases of devoicing: PA *dằk ̔i > *tìkà-, *dằŋk ̔V > *tnká, *dlp ̔a > *tàpìra, *dlp ̔i > *timpə-, *dék ̔a > *tákái, *dl(o)-č ̔V > *tsì, *dup ̔u > *tumpasa.

Notes. Korean shows here the same distribution as for *-t-, i.e. -r- in intervocalic position, but -t in syllable-final position (cf. verbal paradigms like kt- / kərV-, nud- / nurV-, kjəd- / kjərV-, pɨd- / pɨrV-). A generalization of -t- occurred in kot- ‘straight’ and the nouns mut, pt; on the other hand, -r- has been preserved in phɨr < *pɨrh < *pɨrVh < *budVkV and in nir-kup < *nadi- ‘seven’, probably because of a late vowel reduction. Just as in the case with *-t-, the stop is preserved in cases of an early vowel reduction in the first syllable (stɨ-, stɨi, ptui- etc.).



CHAPTER TWO 49
PTM usually preserves *-d- quite well, except in trisyllabic stems of the type CVdVrCV (*xürgü < *k ̔udorgV, *ńurga < *nadurgi, *xargan < *k ̔adi-rgV, *burgu- < *bĕdu-rgV), where -d- has disappeared in the secondary cluster *-dr- < *-dVr-. Japanese has the same distribution of reflexes as for *-b-, i.e. *-j- after diphthongs, but *-t- elsewhere, with occasional prenasalization > *-nt-: 1. *budu > *puj- > *pí-n-kai, *budi > *pìjú, *búdo > *pújù, *bùdo > *pùjàkà-, *ude > *əja(n)si, *uda > *aja, *udi(rV) > *iá-r-, *ŭdu > *i, *kadi > *kí-, *kód[o] > *kájuá-p-, *kudu > *kui, *k ̔ằda > *kàjù-, *múdu > *múi, *núdurgi > *níji- > *nínkír-, *nudi > *ní-, *nda > *nàjàm-, *sudu > *sia; 2. *bdi > *pitapi, *bdu > *pùtuà-, *bòda > *bàtà, *č ̔adVbV > *tatipi-, *gdi > *kítà, *gòde > *ktàpa-, *kádi(rV) > *kítú-, *kádu > *kútúwá, *k ̔ĕdo > *kəti, *k ̔ùdi > *kùtù-pìkì, *móde > *mt-pər-, *nṑda- > *nàtùkà-, *pắda > *pátà, *p ̔di > *pítú, *p ̔āda > *pátú-, *tùdi > *tùtù-, *t ̔édu > *tútáp-, *tdu > *tùtùmí; 3. *bde > *bntr-, *ēda > *ántá, *gódu > *kúntár-, *k ̔adi(-rV) > *káintúr-, *k ̔ad[u] > *kùntùr-, *p ̔edi > *pintua-, *sèda > *sàntàmà-, *sidi > *sintar-, *udu > *ùntài, *péda > *pantara, *ǯàde > *dnt.

Note. Before original *i and *--diphthongs, PTM may have ń- instead of n- here (the distinction of *n- and *ń- in PTM in this position is very dubious), so in this position the best evidence for the distinction is presented by Mongolian (which has *ǯ < *ń) and Japanese (which has *m < *ń), see below. Otherwise PA *n- is quite stable and preserved everywhere except Turkic (where all non-nasal resonants > *j-).

Notes. Non-initial *n is usually rather stable in Altaic languages. Cases when it is lost comprise the following: a. In Mong., *-n- is lost before the nominal suffix -su (či-su < *čin-sun); but just as in Japanese (see below), it is the only attested case of such a development and the root may in fact have been *čū. In a couple of cases *-n- was assimilated to a neighbouring velar and became *-n- > *-ŋ- > -h- (neɣü < *ŋēni, küɣün < *kune). b. In TM, *-n- is sometimes lost in verbal monosyllabic roots after a long vowel: *sī- (*sǖ-) < *sūni, *ā(n)- < *āni. c. Korean regularly loses *-n- in the cluster *-jn-, cf. čăi, ki, mjə-k; after a labial, *n is frequently assimilated to m, cf. mom, pom, pom-nor-, s-pam. Finally, sometimes *n > *ń, probably due to the original following front vowel, cf. nań(ă)-, əńɨrɨm, ańă, ańi, mɨńɨi-. d. Unlike most other resonants, -n- seems to be always preserved in Japanese. The only exception seems to be *tí ‘blood’ < PA *čnu. It cannot thus be excluded that we should reconstruct a monosyllabic *čū here, with a secondarily added suffix -n in Turkic (*dn) and Manchu (ǯun).

It seems that *s- has completely passed into *č- before *-č-, but is preserved better (with later dialectal variation s-/č-) before *-č ̔-, but the number of examples is rather limited and we would better postpone making final decisions. In Korean we have a double reflex: *h- before PA *-a-, *-o- (except in cases of vowel reduction, when *s- stays as the first element of a cluster), but *s- in all other cases.

It seems to be the most stable Altaic phoneme, preserved without any changes in all branches.

Reasons for voicing in these four cases are not yet clear.



52 INTRODUCTION
2.1.19 PA *z
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *z- *j- *s- *s- *s- *s
Notes. PA *z- is distinguished from *s- only within Turkic (*j- < *z- vs. *s- < *s-) which explains its relative rareness: when there is no Turkic reflex, one can reconstruct either *z- or *s-. A trace of the distinction *z- : *s- is, however, recoverable also in Korean, where *z-, unlike *s-, can never give a *h-reflex, even in the position before diphthongs, cf.: *zălVbi > *sjrb-, *zsu > *ssk-, *zoĺa > *sằr-.
This allows us to additionally reconstruct *z- in several cases when the Turkic reflex is absent: *zà[k ̔]ó, *zàmo, *zōnu. Another peculiarity of PA *z is that it is only found in word-initial position. This may indicate that it is either a complementary variant of some other PA phoneme (either *r, *ŕ or *j - neither of these three occurs in word-initial position), or has merged word-medially with some other phoneme (either *-s- or *-ǯ-). This problem cannot so far be resolved from within Altaic.

Notes. Korean frequently has -j- as a development of *-jr-. In Jpn., the distribution between -r- and -t- is as yet unclear: it may well be that Jpn. here reflects some original distinction lost in other languages. A suspicious fact is an extreme frequency of non-initial *r, far exceeding that of any other PA phoneme, which may be an indication that we are in fact dealing here with two original phonemes, perhaps still distinguished in Japanese. Besides -t-, Japanese sometimes has voiced (prenasalized) *-nt-. Unlike with the stops, however, the distribution here appears to be plainly positional: *-nt- in the vast majority of cases appears in intervocalic position before the following intervocalic -r-: cf. *tre > *dntá-ri, *góra > kántúrá, *keru > *kunturi, *koru > *kùntírà, *ṑr(e)kV > *ntrk-, *p ̔ōri > *pìntárí, *šèru > *sùntàre, *ǯaru > *dunturi. Voiceless *-t- does not appear in such a position except in verbal stems, where the following -r- is syllable-final (*re > *ítár-, *k ̔ēro > *kátár-, *saru > *sutar-). In a few other cases (*úru > *úntì, *seri > *sìntí, *mri > *mí(ntú), *nra > *nàntùki, *p ̔ire > *pintipa) the reasons for voicing are not quite clear: note that the last two words are not actually attested in modern dialects and the readings with -nt- (OJ -d-) may in fact be fictitious, and -ntú in *mí-ntú ‘water’ may be a suffix (the root is *mí and may go back to PA *mūri-gV, see below). In nominal stems Jpn. has several cases of *-r- > -0-, all of which should be explained by original suffixation: *p- ‘fire’ < *p ̔ore-gV; *pa ‘leaf’ < *pure-gV (cf. Mong. *bor-gu-), *kua ‘flour’ < *gure-gV, *mə ‘weed’ < *moro-gV or -ŋV (cf. Evk. moriŋā), *bi ‘well, spring’ < *bujri-gV (cf. TM *bira-ga), kua ‘basket’ < *k ̔ure-gV, *pia ‘layer’ < *pari-gV (cf. TM *par-ga-) or *-ŋV (cf. PT *biar-ŋa-k), ta ‘field’ < *t ̔ora-gV (cf. Mong. *tari-ja- < *tari-ɣa-), pu ‘growth’ < *p ̔ri-gV (cf. Turk. *urug), su ‘nest’ < *zuru-gV, perhaps also *mí ‘water’ < *mūri-gV (cf. Man. mū-ke). In Mong. *r is normally preserved, although there are some indications that it could have been lost before the nominal suffixes *-su-, *-du



54 INTRODUCTION
(cf. *ǯi-sü-, *mo-du-). There is also one case of a presumable metathesis *-r-l- > *-l-r- (*beltereg < *ber-teleg), but this phenomenon is much less widespread than the reverse one (i.e. *-l-r- > *-r-l-, see below). Just as *l is dissimilated before the following *l (see below), *r in Mongolian was possibly dissimilated before the following *-r-, and the combination *-rVr- yielded *-hVr- (*-ɣVr-). Cases like this are, however, not easy to find: cf. perhaps eɣere- ‘seek, wish’ < *here-re- < PA *p ̔ro; on *kajir(a)- ‘bark’ < *kari-ra < PA *k ̔éŕa see below. In TM, *-r- (just like *-n-) sometimes is lost in monosyllabic roots after a long vowel: *bū- < *bōr[e], *bū- < *būri, *mō < *mūro, *mū < *mūri, *ī- < *īre-, *sē < *zēra, *dā < *tārV.
2.1.21 PA initial *l
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *l- *j- *l-, n- *l- *n- *n
Notes. There are only about 40 clear examples of initial *l- because it is distinguished from *ĺ (or *l1) only in Mongolian (where the latter > *d- / *ǯ-, see below). The distinction between *l- and *ĺ- is thus not absolutely secure, but rather probable because it supports the distinction of non-initial *l and *ĺ. Turkic, Korean and Japanese do not distinguish reflexes of *l- from those of *n- (see above). Tungus has regularly *l- here (although within Tungus there exists a strong tendency of confusing *l- and *n- as well); Mongolian has in many cases preserved *l- (especially before labials, but also in some cases before velars), but many dialects tend to replace *l- by *n-, and in some cases no traces of *l- are preserved at all. Still it may be observed that cases with *l- in Mong. reveal a high rate of correlation with *l- in Tungus (cf. *làbo, *labV, *làku, *lak ̔a, *lằŋi, *láp ̔i, *lble, *lebu(nV), *lebV, *lòmu, *lùbu, *lu[k]u, *lŭge). We assume, therefore, that the tendency of *l- > *n- was unilateral, and reconstruct *l- in all cases when it emerges in Tungus and/or Mongolian (note that there does not exist a single case with Mong. *l- and TM *n- - which shows that Mong. *l- cannot be a secondary variant of the original *n-). Let us once again return to Doerfer’s criticism. In TMN 1, 63 he says: “Ich möchte mich hier kurz fassen und nur soviel sagen, daß ich das gesamte Material für mit l- anlautende Wörter des Tu. durchgearbeitet habe (bei Benzing, 1955a und V), ohne im Tü. und Mo. auch nur ein einziges vergleichbares Wort zu finden.” Let us see what we have:

It is worth noting that both in Mong. and TM *l- may be called “an expressive phoneme”: the number of words starting with *l- and meaning ‘slimy substance’, ‘mud’, ‘to shake, sway’, ‘snore, shout’ is quite considerable. It seems, however, that this was the original PA situation (no matter what caused it ultimately), because several of these roots are undoubtedly common Altaic. But there is also a number of quite neutral roots with *l-, such as *la- ‘near, this side’, *làbo ‘more, better’, *lako ‘foliate tree’, *láp ̔i ‘flat, broad’, *lmo ‘bag’, *lmo ‘sea’, *lèjk ̔a ‘intend, demand’, *lélugV ‘kerchief, pendant’, *lŏga ‘green, dark’, *lòmu ‘bow’, *lk ̔a ‘seam’, *lŭge ‘halter, rope for animals’, *lop ̔V ‘nest’, *luko ‘wild pig’, *lúŋa ‘furry animal’, *lùk ̔V ‘lynx’ etc.

Notes. 1. Turkic always preserves l. 2. In Mong. there are some cases of the loss of *-l- before the nominal suffix *-sü-, usually with variation across dialects (cf. *söl-sü ‘gall’ > WMong. sösü(n), Khalkha sös, but MMong. sülsü, Bur. hülhen). Two other processes must be also mentioned: a) The sequence *-l-r- is regularly metathesized > *-r-l-, cf. *hurul < *p ̔ulo, *maral < *mula (although this does not seem to happen before the suffixes -čir, -bur, -kir in *belčir, *čilbur, *čulu-kir, and perhaps in the clusters *jl, *bl cf. *ölir < *ójle, *ǯilar < *dúblu). b) The sequence *-l-l- is regularly dissimilated > *-j-l- (or -h-l- if the intermediate vowel is -e-), cf. *küjil-sü < *k ̔ōli, *mojil ( = PT *beleĺ) < *melu, *beɣelej < *bili, *majila-su < *malu.
3. In TM *l is well preserved (except for sporadic cases of assimilation in clusters like *xińŋa- < *xil-ŋa- ‘hair’). However, just as with *-nand *-r-, there are cases of the loss of *-l in monosyllabic roots after a



58 INTRODUCTION
long vowel: *ō- < *ōlu, *nā < *nālV, *sō- < *sōlV, *tī- < *t ̔ōlo, *sī (but *sīl-se) < *sūli, *ǯō (but Nan. ǯōl) < *tṓle.
4. Korean has -0- (-i-) for *-jl-, cf. păi < *p ̔ējlo, kui < *k ̔ūjlu, pih < *bujlu, oijə-s < *ojle, sui < *sujli.
5. Japanese loses *-l- (just like most other resonants) before the original suffix *-gV-, cf. *ká- < *kal-gV < *k ̔ila-gV ( = PT *Kɨl-k, Mong. kil-ga-), *dua < *dul-ga (or *dul-ba, cf. TM *dolba?) < *dŭle, *pa < *pal-gV < *pala-gV, *du < *dul-gV < *dūlu-gV ( = Mong. *dulaɣa-, PT *jɨlɨg), *da- < *ǯal-gV < *ǯalo-gV (cf. Mong. ǯalga-), *pə (reduplicated *pə-pə) < *pəl-gV < *p ̔ulo-gV, *pu- < *pul-gV < *balu-gV.
6. Intervocalic *-l- is lost in Korean and Japanese (but also in some forms of the Turkic paradigm) in a few basic verbal roots: cf. *gele ‘to come’, *ōlu ‘to be’, *sóle ‘to make, put’, *ala ‘to take, receive’, *p ̔ìlo ‘to dry, heat’. This seems to be a Proto-Altaic morphonological peculiarity; see more on that in the section on root structure.

Examples of non-initial *-č ̔- can be found in the following entries: *ắč ̔V, *buč ̔o, *áč ̔u, *č ̔éč ̔í, *č ̔eč ̔u, *č ̔[i]č ̔V, *ēč ̔o, *gàč ̔i, *góč ̔e, *ič ̔u, *ič ̔V, *ṓč ̔é, *káč ̔u, *kč ̔ù, *kč ̔á, *kūč ̔ú, *k ̔č ̔V, *máč ̔à, *máč ̔Ỽ, *mač ̔e, *mùč ̔e, *mṓč ̔a, *nač ̔i, *nč ̔á, *neč ̔è, *ńéč ̔ù, *pč ̔à, *puč ̔ù, *p ̔ač ̔V, *p ̔ḗč ̔V, *peč ̔i, *p ̔ĭč ̔i, *p ̔č ̔o, *p ̔úč ̔í, *sč ̔i, *šàč ̔í, *s[ó]č ̔i, *šimuč ̔V, *t ̔uč ̔V, *ùč ̔e, *ùč ̔ìk ̔V, *č ̔o, *úč ̔u, *č ̔i, *ǯeč ̔i, *k ̔ač ̔e, *kéč ̔à.
Notes. In Korean a reflex *s is also possible in consonant clusters after vowel reduction (*čC is not allowed), and in syllable-final position, where the distinction *-č : *-s was already weakened in MKor.: MKor. kàčh / kàs ‘skin’ < *káč ̔u, MKor. nằčh, nằs < *ŋàkča, *ps-krì- < *peč ̔i, *sàskí < *šàč ̔k[o], *skú-mí- < *ùč ̔ik ̔V.



CHAPTER TWO 59
As in other cases, Japanese here has a split reflex (*-t- or voiced / prenasalized *-nt-):
1. *buč ̔o > *pətə-pər-, *č ̔eč ̔u > *tùtù-nsí, *ēč ̔o > *tr-, *ič ̔u > *utu, *káč ̔u > *kútí, *máč ̔a > *mátúr-, *máč ̔V > *mátuá, *mùč ̔e > *màtú, *neč ̔e > *ntì, *ńéč ̔u > *mútúkár-, *pč ̔a > *pàtùr-, *puč ̔u > *puta-, *šàč ̔i > *sìtú, *sóč ̔i > *sítá-nkap-, *ùč ̔ik ̔V > *ùtùkù-, *č ̔o > *t-, *ǯeč ̔i > *(d)ìtí, *k ̔ač ̔e > *kt, *kéč ̔a > *kátà, *mànč ̔u > *mùtù-kí, *múkč ̔a > *mútì 2. č ̔éč ̔i > *tíntí-, *ṓč ̔e > *nt-, *kč ̔a > *kàntuá, *kuč ̔u > *kùntk-, *nč ̔á > *nàntá-, *p ̔úč ̔i > *púntí, *p ̔ắnč ̔i > *pínták-.
2.1.25 PA initial *č
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *č- *d- *d- /*č[i] *ǯ- *č- *t
Notes. This phoneme was first reconstructed in АПиПЯЯ, on the basis of examples with *d- in Turkic and Mongolian correlated with affricate reflexes in TM and Korean. In Turkic and Mongolian PA *č- early merged with PA *t- and yields exactly the same results. The reflex of *č- and *t- is quite similar also in Japanese; but note that PA *č- never yields *d- (unlike *t- which gives *d- before i, ə). Finally, in Korean and Tungus the reflex of *č- is the same as that of *ǯ- (q.v.).
2.1.26 PA non-initial *-č
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *č *č *č *s *č *s
Examples for non-initial *č can be seen in the following entries: *apuči, *ăčV, *éča , *guči, *če, *ču, *káče, *kăči, *kḗči, *koči, *kuču, *kóčè, *kūči, *k ̔ăču, *k ̔áčo, *k ̔oča, *k ̔ùčù, *k ̔ča, *k ̔čV, *láčà, *mḗča, *nòču, *óče, *p ̔uču, *p ̔ṑči, *p ̔ùčV, *sìča, *suču, *súču, *šàčú, *šéčo, *šòče, *šṓča.
Notes. This row of correspondences occurs only in non-initial position and is thus in complementary distribution with word-initial *č-. Although its reflexes seem to be quite different from those of *č-, the difference is not difficult to explain. In Turkic we have a voiceless reflex, similar to the standard reflex of voiceless unaspirated consonants, whereas in initial position we find *č- > *d- with deaffrication (so that d-, -č- here is in fact analogous to d-, -t- < PA *t). In Korean we would expect something like *-ǯ-, but the general process of devoicing has resulted in *-ǯ



60 INTRODUCTION
> -č-. In Mong. we have a uniform reflex -č-, thus the phoneme behaves exactly like unaspirated *-t- in the position of palatalization, i.e. like [*]. In TM and Jpn., an early process of fricativization resulted in *-č- > -š- > -s-. In a few cases TM has -š- instead of the expected -s-. This happens regularly due to assimilation after the preceding *š- (*šoša-, *š[e]še-, *šušu), and in consonant clusters *-jč- or *-bč- (*ŋüši-, *ma[b]ši-). Korean has the same variation of -s and -č in syllable-final position as with *č ̔: *čs < *sìča, MKor. sùs < *suču, MKor. čís / číčh < *šoče, nằs-ká- < *ŋṓjču.
It is worth noting that just as all other voiceless stops medial *č is never voiced (prenasalized) in Japanese, except in some clusters with resonants (on which see below).
2.1.27 PA initial *ǯ
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *ǯ- *j- *ǯ- *ǯ- *č- *d
The phoneme gives quite simple and uniform reflexes in all branches. Note that in Japanese it always yields *d-, independently of following vowels or consonants. This indicates that by the time of the devoicing processes (*d- > *t-, see above) it was still an affricate or a palatalized *-; see more on this below.
2.1.28 PA non-initial *ǯ
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *ǯ *j *ǯ *ǯ *č *j
Examples for medial *-ǯ- may be found in the following entries: *aǯo, *ǯV, *bằǯá, *bēǯu, *č ̔ăǯV, *kaǯurV, *kùǯi, *k ̔ĕǯa, *k ̔ǯa, *k ̔uǯV, *k ̔uǯV, *laǯV, *nāǯV, *òǯa, *pḕǯo, *poǯi, *sàǯV, *s[o]ǯe, *ǯaǯa, *ǯòǯu, *ǯṓǯe, *ǯāǯV.
Notes. Medial -ǯ- is not frequent, but seems to be reliably reconstructable. In Jpn. -t- is encountered occasionally, as a result of early assimilation (cf. the variants ti < *tiji / titi; *duta-ka < *duda-ka instead of the expected *duja-ka). However, the standard and most frequent reflex is a uniform *-j- (sometimes reduced to -0- in -ia-/-ai- diphthongs, like in *sài-r- < *sàǯV).



CHAPTER TWO 61
In Kor. in syllable-final position we may also have the reflex -s (as with other affricates): MKor. čjs < *č ̔ăjǯV, kàskàp- < *k ̔ǯa, sàskì < *s[u]ǯakV.
The *-j-reflex in Turkic was also criticized by Doerfer in TMN. He takes five rather unfortunate examples from Ramstedt’s KW and comes to the conclusion that “Für mo. Wörter mit -ǯ- finden sich also im Tü. keine Vergleichswörter”. The phoneme is not frequent, but nevertheless we can counter this conclusion with the following examples: PT *čAj-na- ‘to chew, bite’ : Mong. *ǯaǯi- ‘to chew’ ( < *čaǯi- with assimilation) < PA *č ̔ăǯV PT *ȫj- ‘to think, understand’ (-j- is lost here in Old Turkic, but well preserved in Yak. üöj-): Mong. *üǯe- ‘to see’ < PA *ḗbǯo PT *Kạjɨr ‘salt steppe’ : Mong. *kuǯir ‘salty earth’ < PA *kaǯurV PT *Kajɨra- ‘to whet, sharpen; to rub teeth’ : Mong. *kaǯa- ‘to bite’ < PA *k ̔ĕǯa
PT *KAj- ‘to turn back, towards’ : Mong. *kaǯiwu ‘side, edge’ < PA *k ̔ǯa
PT *jāj ‘summer’ : Mong. *naǯir id. < PA *nāǯV PT *oj- ‘to play’ : Mong. *oǯu- ‘to kiss’ < PA *òǯa PT *jogan (probably < *jojgan with dissimilation) ‘thick’ : Mong. *ǯuǯaɣan id. < PA *ǯòǯu
PT *jōj ‘cunning, lying’: Mong. *ǯüǯig ‘show, act, theatre’ < PA *ǯṓǯe Several of these words (‘salt steppe’, ‘summer’, ‘play’, ‘thick’) could be found in the literature, and in fact the words for ‘play/kiss’ and ‘summer’ are dealt with in other parts of Doerfer’s TMN. But he still says “keine Vergleichswörter”...
2.1.29 PA initial *ń
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *ń- *j- *ǯ- *ń- *n- *m
Notes. The Mong. reflex ǯ-, still absent in АПиПЯЯ, was discovered and proved by A. Dybo [Дыбо 1995]. The phonetically strange reflex in Japanese can be explained as a result of a shift *ń- > *ŋ- > *m- (already after the original *ŋ- had yielded 0- word-initially, see below). The change *ń- > *ŋ- is typologically rare, but attested, e.g., in Southern Chinese dialects. It is perhaps worth noting that the reflex *ń > ž (ǯ) is typical for Northern Chinese dialects. So the Altaic languages here reproduce the same model of development that was typical for Chinese in the 8th-10th centuries AD.



62 INTRODUCTION
2.1.30 PA non-initial *-ń
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *ń *ń *j, n *ń *ń *n, *m
Examples for medial *ń can be found in the following entries: *ńe(-č ̔V), *ńu, *ńa, *číńo, *č ̔àńè, *tàńo, *eńa, *ńa, *eńa, *ińo, *k ̔ùńí, *kḕńu, końo, *kúńà, *kúńe, *k ̔eńo, *k ̔ńó, *k ̔éńo, *k ̔ńu, *k ̔ùńe, *k ̔ōńi, *k ̔ńi, *peńo, *leńa, *ĺńi, *mńa, *mańuk ̔V, *meń[o], *mińV, *móńù, *mṓńe, *mùńa, *mūńa(kV), *n[u]ńa, *ŋăńa, *ŋńì, *ṑńè, *ańu, *pańi, *beńa, *p ̔úńe, *póńe, *pàńé, *p ̔eńu, *p ̔ońa, *p ̔úńe, *sáńo, *sańV(-k ̔V), *sńi, *nańa, *kṓńi.
Notes. Non-initial *ń exists in Turkic, TM and Korean, but is a highly unstable phoneme. Turkic. The normal reflex here is *ń (often hardly distinguishable from *j). The palatal quality, however, is lost in secondary clusters (cf. *jīn-čik, *jaŋɨ < *jań-gɨ, *En-č, *saŋ-k < *sań-k), and frequently (although not always) after *ɨ, *o and *ü (cf. *gün as opposed to *guńaĺ, *Kn, *jonɨrčga, *Konak).
Mongolian. Here there are two basic reflexes: -j- and -n-, the distribution of which has been established by I. Gruntov. The rules are: a) the basic reflex is *-j-; b) the reflex -n- appears: in a dissimilative manner after -i- (kinu-, sinu-, sine); after and before *h ( = intervocalic *-ɣ-), like in čineɣe, inije-, keneɣe, kunija, munig, nimniɣa, suɣunag, hünir, huni-, hani, hünesü.
Palatal *-ń- also disappears (just like *-n-, *-r-) before the nominal suffix -su (*ja-su, *hü-sü) and is liable to velar assimilation *-ń- > *-ŋ- > -h(cf. gege-ɣe < *geɣe- < *geŋe- < *geńe-; köŋge-n < *köń-ge-; saŋ-ga- < *sań-ga-; oŋgo-n < *oń-go-). In some cases with initial velar it is not quite clear whether we are dealing with a case of velar assimilation (köɣene < *köŋene < *köńene) or a positional variant of -j- (köɣene = /köjene/).
PTM. Tungus-Manchu normally has -ń- except for some cases of neutralization before -i- and in consonant clusters (*xeŋ-gu- < *xeń-gu-, *xunǯi < *xuń-ǯi, *ŋāni- = *ŋāńi-, *mun-di- < *muń-di-, *uŋia- < *uńi-ga-, *pani- = *pańi-, *munī- = *muńī-, *puŋel < *puń-gV-l). Note that no cases of a loss of *-ń- are attested (perhaps accidentally). Korean. The cluster *-jń- regularly yields -j- here (cf. s-pjə, sai, kui, păi). Otherwise, the normal reflex is *ń, with a sporadic change to -n- after *i and *u, cf. pinɨr, nūn, kin(h) and in clusters (an-č-). Japanese. Here the reflexes are -m- (evidently < *-ŋ- < *-ń-, just as word-initially) and -n-; the distribution is so far unclear. There are



CHAPTER TWO 63
two possible cases of *-ń- > -0- before a suffixed *-gV: *ka- ‘day’ < *gojńu-gV (cf. Mong. gege-ɣe) and *ka ‘mosquito’ < *kuńe-gV (cf. TM *kuńī-kta).
2.1.31 PA initial *š
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *š- *s- /*č[*A] *s- / *č[*A] *š- *s- *s
The reconstruction of PA *š- is based on the reconstruction of PTM *š — a phoneme usually reflected as š in Manchu, but as č in other languages. Elsewhere the phoneme basically merged with *s-, but traces of a special behaviour can be found in Turkic and Mongolian —where *š> *s- only before front vowels, whereas before back vowels *š- > *č- —, as well as in Korean, where, despite a certain paucity of evidence, one can observe that *s- yields *h- before *-a-, *-u- , whereas *š- always yields *s-.
2.1.32 PA non-initial *-š
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *š *s *s *š *s *s
Non-initial *-š- is extremely rare (and, for some reason, found almost exclusively after velars); examples for *-š- are restricted to: *bašo, *guša, *kóšì, *kŏše, *kùši, *kušu, *kušV, *k ̔òše, *k ̔ŏši.
Notes. As seen from the correspondences, medial *-š- is distinguished from *-s- only in TM. The correspondence, however, is quite parallel to initial *š-, only without the positional affrication in Turkic, Mongolian and Korean. So the phoneme still seems worth reconstructing. In Jpn. *-š-, like *-s- is not liable to voicing (prenasalization) - at least in those few cases where it is reflected at all.
2.1.33 PA *-ŕ
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *ŕ *ŕ *r *r *r *r / t[i,u]
Examples for *-ŕ- can be found in the following dictionary entries: *àŕì, *āŕa, *bằŕ[i], *bāŕa, *baŕV, *bĕŕa, *bŕu, *boŕV, *bŭŕi, *čobeŕV, *čuŕi, *čúŕu, *č ̔iŕV, *deŕa, *ǯiŕe, *dŭŕi, *ḗŕa, *gằŕ[à], *gŕV, *gằŕá, *gṑŕe, *gŕa, *gṓŕV, *gŕi, *ŕu, *kúŕu, *kŕa, *k ̔aŕa, *k ̔éŕà, *k ̔ŕo, *k ̔óŕa, *k ̔ŏŕo, *k ̔uŕa,

Notes. PA *ŕ, like *r, occurred only in non-initial position. It is reconstructed basically on Turkic evidence where it is clearly distinct from *r. One may note, however, that the Jpn. correspondence also differs. Superficially Jpn. has the same two reflexes - r and t - as for PA *r. Here, however, they are in rather clear complementary distribution: -t- occurs only before root-final -i and -u, whereas -r- occurs in all other cases (root-finally, before -a and -ə). The only exceptions are those when the reflex of *-ŕ- is attested in the second syllable of a trisyllabic stem: *turu(m)pai, *sita-t(a)-, *katana, *kətəpək-, *kuruma. In all probability the second vowel here is a result of later assimilation either to the first or to the third one. Here, as with other resonants, in PTM loss of *-ŕ- after a long vowel in monosyllables is attested: *sā- < *sāŕi. In Jpn., however, *-ŕ- (like other palatal resonants) is never lost. Its *-t-reflex is also never voiced (prenasalized). This lack of voicing may be important: it probably means that the change -ŕ- > -t- occurred quite late, already after the process of prenasalization of original stops was completed — which also complies with the fact that the change -ŕ- > -thappens before PJ *-i and *-u, vowels that evidently come from many different Altaic sources, i.e. already after various important vocalic changes in the history of Japanese.
2.1.34 PA initial *ĺ
PA Turk. Mong. Tung. Kor. Jpn. *ĺ- *j- *d- / ǯ[i] *l- *n- *n
Notes. Initial *ĺ- is reconstructed in a small but significant number of cases where all languages reflect *l- but Mong. has a reflex typical for *d-. In one case — *ĺmo(ŋa) — even the TM forms have not preserved traces of *l- (probably because of very early nasal assimilation *ĺŏmo(ŋa) > *ńŏmo(ŋa)), but the Mongolian reflex *d- cannot be explained in any other way. One could reconstruct something like a voiced lateral affricate here, but we assume that this correspondence is in fact a match for the



CHAPTER TWO 65
widely attested word-medial PA *-ĺ- (see below), whose initial reflex was hitherto unknown. To provide additional information on Turkic *j- corresponding to TM *l- (but this time < *ĺ-) we shall list the cases here:

Notes. PA *ĺ is well preserved in all branches. Besides the standard reflexes we may note the following: a) In Turkic, *-ĺ- > *-l- in combination with some affixes (Helimski’s rule, see Хелимский 1986b); cf. *jul-tuŕ (not *juĺ-tuŕ) < *p ̔uĺo. b) In Mong., *-ĺ- > -0- before the affixes -du-, -su- (cf. ho-dun < *hol-dun < *p ̔uĺo, *si-dü < *sil-dü, *na-su < *nal-su, *mö-sü (but also *möl-sü)). Just like *-l-, *-ĺ- is dissimilated > -j- before the following -l- (*bujil- < *bŏĺi, *üjile < *ilü-le < *ĺi) and metathesized before the following -r(*kerelǯegene < *kele-r-ǯegene < *k ̔ĺú) .
c) In Kor., *-jĺ- > *-j-, -0- (cf. na(h) < *najĺV, soi < *zejĺu, pɨi- < *bujĺe). d) In Jpn., *-ĺ- (just like *-ŕ- and *-ń-), never yields -0- in combination with the following affixes. Thus the only reflex here is -s-, which, however, can also be voiced (prenasalized) into -ns-. Conditions for prenasalization are here exactly the same as in the case with -nt- < -t- < *-r- (see above): *-s- > -ns- in intervocalic position before the following intervocalic -r-: cf. *kĺe > *knsìrì, *mĺi > *mínsrá-, probably also *gĺo > *kìsàra-nki (not *kinsaranki because of the dissimilation rule in Japanese); but in verbal stems *sṓĺ[e] > *ssír-, *p ̔ĺo > *pàsìr-, *móĺe > *músír-, *búĺa > *básúrá-. Exceptions are *gĺu > kusirə and *dằĺa > *dàsìr ‘shrine’ (the latter probably under influence of *sirə ‘castle’). Note, however, that voicing of *-ĺ- occurs rather frequently in old consonant clusters (*ĺč, *ĺb, etc., see below).

Notes. PA *j is reconstructed only in word-medial position. It may well be thought, however, that it was represented word-initially as the first part of the *-diphthongs *a-, *u-, *o- (see below). PA *-j- is preserved everywhere, but in every subgroup it has a tendency to disappear — in the vicinity of front vowels, being swallowed up by preceding diphthongs etc. In Mong. -j- tends to be replaced by -h-, mostly before the following -e or -u-vowels. In TM there are several cases of *-j- disappearing after a long vowel: *gṑje > *gū, *nji > *ńā-, *ńūje > *ńē-, *p ̔āji > *pā, *p ̔ūji > *pū-, *sōje > *sū-, *tjV > *dā, *ŋūja > *ŋō-.
In Turkic there are several cases when original *-j- seems to be reflected as *-d-: cf. *ŋūja > *jɨd, *ŋūju > *ūdɨ-, *sèjV > *sedre-, *gằju > *Kadgu. Note that in the cases where Chuvash has preserved these roots it has not the standard -r-reflex, but -j- (ɨjɣъ, sajra, xojɣa), so that in fact *-d- (*-δ-) may have been introduced here already after the separation of Chuvash. The conditions of its appearance, however, are not clear. In the case of *ūdɨ- ‘sleep’, e.g., it could be just an added suffix (because the simple noun *ū ‘sleep’ is also preserved); in *jɨd and *sedre it could be a result of dissimilation < *-j-; finally, old interdialectal loans also cannot be excluded (in *Kaja ‘rock’ we also find *-j- instead of an expected *-d-).

Notes. In Mong., there are cases of secondary voicing *-k- > -g- in front of a following -g- (-h-): cf. *sögüɣe, *čaga-ɣan, *jaga-ɣan, *sege-ɣe- (but also *seke-ɣe) < *sk ̔u, *sege-ɣe (but also *seke-ɣe) < *sk ̔a. Less frequent are other cases of voicing: *ege-če as a suffixed form of *eke, *ogo-da-su, *daga- in variation with *daka-. The reflex *g also regularly occurs in syllable-final position, where all laryngeal features were neutralized in Mongolian (see above on labials and dentals). In two cases (*uɣurga and *ǯeɣergene; perhaps also *čiɣire < *č ̔ik ̔ò-rV) there occurred further weakening *-g- > *-h- in a secondary cluster *-k ̔r- (on cluster development see below). In TM, where the distinction between *-k- and *-x- is maintained in the Southern subgroup (see below), PA *-k ̔- can yield both *-k- and *-x-. The distribution here seems to depend on the original following vowel: before PA *-a and *-e PTM has *-k-, while before the high vowels *-i and *-u, as well as before *-o, PTM has *-x-. Cf.:
1. k ̔a > *akā, *k ̔à > *ok-, *čĕk ̔a > *ǯeki, *č ̔k ̔à > *čiku-, *č ̔ṑk ̔a > *čōk(i)-, *dék ̔à > *deke-, *gék ̔á > *gek(u)-, *gk ̔a > *guk-, *uk ̔e > *ukī, *k ̔è > *ikē-, *kk ̔è > *xuku-n / *kuku-n, *lk ̔a > *lāk-, *mak ̔é > *maka-, *mk ̔é > *mōk-, *nk ̔e > *nīka, *pk ̔a > *pukē-n, *p ̔ok ̔e > *puke-, *sṑk ̔e > *sōk-, *šk ̔a > *šāk-, *t ̔ak ̔a > *tiaku, *ǯak ̔a > *ǯiaka, *ǯók ̔è > *ǯuke 2. *ằk ̔ú > *axiri-, *č ̔k ̔ó > *čixa-, *dằk ̔ì > *daxa-, *kk ̔i > *kaxa-, *làk ̔ù > *laxu-, *lok ̔o > *loxa, *măk ̔ó > *muxa-, *mók ̔ì > *muxu-, *mūk ̔o ( ~ -u) > *muxa- / *muxe-, *sèk ̔u > *sexu-, *sk ̔ù > *six-, *t ̔k ̔ò > *tāxVr, *t ̔ak ̔i ( ~ -u) > *taxi, *t ̔ḗk ̔o > *texēn, *t ̔ŏk ̔ù > *toxan, *t ̔k ̔ù > *tux-, *č ̔ik ̔ò > *čixe

Korean has normally -k-. However, after vowel reduction *CVk ̔regularly yields *Ch-; in a few cases the reflex -h- (or even -0-) is observed even without vowel reduction, due to causes yet to be discovered.

Notes. Non-initial *-k- is somewhat hard to distinguish from *-k ̔- (see above). The reflexes in Jpn. and Turkic are basically the same - except that in Japanese *-k-, unlike *-k ̔- is not prenasalized (see below) and Turkic *-k-, unlike *-k ̔-, is regularly voiced before the following *r: cf. *iagɨr, *biagɨr, *ugra-, *Kagur, *čɨgɨr, *jogurgan, *jogurt-, *boguŕ, *sogur, *tagra-, *sɨgɨr, *jagɨr (in one case - *dEgiŋ - also before *ŋ). In TM *-k-, always gives a stop *-k- (unlike *-k ̔- which in very many cases yields *-x-, see above). In Kor. *-k- usually does not give -k-, but disappears or leaves aspiration (-h-); exceptions are cases of vowel reduction in the first syllable (*skór < *saku), and assimilations (like mək-kuri ‘big black snake’ < *mūko, sok-kori (but mod. sokhuri = *soh-kuri) ‘basket’ < *sku).
The really decisive language here is Mongolian which regularly has *-g- < *-k-. In very many cases, however - when Turkic has *-k- without a following *r, the Mong. reflex is unknown (or has a syllable-final -g, or has a -g- before the following -ɣ-), the TM reflex is ambiguous, and the Kor. reflex is unknown or has a syllable-final -k, *-k- and *-k ̔- cannot be distinguished from each other. This explains a relatively small number of clear cases of *-k-. Japanese, as we said above, does not usually voice (prenasalize) *-k-, like all other unaspirated stops. All exceptions occur only in roots with initial aspirated consonants: *k ̔ằku > *kùnkùtú, *k ̔ōki > *kunki, *p ̔àka > *pànkiá-, *t ̔ki > *tinkui, *t ̔ki > *tìnkìr-, *t ̔uki > *túnk-. This is obviously the result of an early assimilation process *C ̔VCV > *C ̔VC ̔V (see above on the same with other stops).

Notes. Turkic neutralizes the distinction of *k- and *g- before back vowels, see above, so in that position we write *K- in Proto-Turkic.



CHAPTER TWO 71
The correspondence Mong. ɣ- : Turkic q- — i.e. exactly PA *g- before back vowels— was also criticized by Doerfer (p. 60), who says he can find only one clear case: Mong. ɣar ‘hand, arm’ : Turk. qar (i.e. *Kar) ‘arm’. He is correct in abolishing four of Ramstedt’s examples that are actually borrowings. We think that Ramstedt’s another example (Turk. *Kob- ‘to follow, chase’: Mong. *guji- ‘to search, ask’ (cf. also TM *gob‘to hunt’, Jpn. *kp- ‘to ask’) is still quite valid. Doerfer argues that the older form attested in Mong. is ɣuju- (in the SH), so that ɣuji- must be a recent assimilation, and cannot therefore go back to a form with *b-. To this we may comment that the SH is by no means the most archaic form of Mongolian with respect to vowels: numerous cases of assimilation are already attested there — such as ǯurokan ‘heart’ against WMong. ǯirüken. More significantly, no process like “assimilation of u to the preceding j” has ever taken place in the history of Mongolian. Still another refuted example (for semantic reasons) is Turk. *Kol- ‘to beg, beggar’ (not “bitten” as Doerfer writes): Mong. ɣolu- ‘to be unhappy, despise’; the original meaning here was obviously just ‘be unhappy, endure’ (cf. the TM and Jpn. parallels in PA *gòlo), whence “to be a beggar” is a quite natural development. Let us now look at other examples: Turk. *Kadgu ‘sorrow’ : Mong. *gaj id. < PA *gằju Turk. *KAj- ‘to pay respect’ : Mong. *gajika- ‘to wonder’ < PA *gajV Turk. *Kal ‘wild, rough’: Mong. *galǯaɣu ‘wild, rabid’ < PA *gắli Turk. *Kabɨk, *Kabɨŕ ‘shell, husk’: Mong. *gawr-su ‘chaff, straw’ < PA *gébo
Turk. *KAkɨ- ‘to be angry’: Mong. *gaɣa- id. < PA *gga Turk. *Kalɨŋ ‘thick’: Mong. *goli- ‘be tall, stately, gross’ < *gălu Turk. *Kiāl- ‘to stay behind’: Mong. *gal- ‘to walk slowly, be lazy’ < PA *gla
Turk. *Kula- ‘to jump over’, *Kulač ‘fathom’ ( < *’spread’) : Mong. *guldu ‘along smth.’ < PA *gŭldo Turk. *Kōl ‘valley’ : Mong. *gowl id. < PA *goblu Turk. *Kodɨ ‘below, downwards’: Mong. *gudu- ‘to lower, downward’ < PA *gódu
Turk. *Koŋuŕ ‘beetle’ : Mong. *guwur ‘larva of a gad-fly’ < PA *goŋV(ŕV) Turk. *Kun- ‘to rob, plunder, attack’ : Mong. *gani ‘berserk; to strive, endeavour’ < PA *guna Turk. *Kūtuŕ ‘mad, enraged, instigate’: Mong. *gutu(ra)- ‘lose power, lose courage’ < PA *gt ̔u Most of these examples have been mentioned in the literature, and four are actually taken from the same text which Doerfer is criticizing.



72 INTRODUCTION
This is again an example of Doerfer’s debating technique (for *m-, *l-, *-ǯ-, see above): poor evidence is criticized while better evidence is omitted from discussion.

Notes. In Mong., the usual reflex is -h- (orthographically -ɣ-, see above; -jin front of -i-), but before the following -ɣ-, -j- we see a stop reflex -g-: *aga-ɣar (the WMong. spelling is aɣar, but modern forms like Khalkha agār show that it should be amended to aɣaɣar) < *aga; *aguji < *ága; *aɣu- (Khalkha ū-dam), but *agu-ɣu, *agu-ji (Khalkha agū, aguj) < *ḗgo, *nogo-ɣan < *lŏga, *ügej < *ge, *sigi-ɣa- < *síga, *sigu-j < *sgo, *dege-ɣe < *teg[u], *togu-ɣa(n) < *t ̔age, *tuguj < *t ̔ge, *ǯögeji < *ǯuge.
In clusters with resonants and in syllable-final position, Mongolian always has the stop reflex g. In Japanese the distribution of reflexes is quite similar to that of *-band *-d-, namely, after original diphthongs we always have a 0-reflex, (cf. *-w- < *-b-, *-j- < *-d-), usually resulting in vowel contraction, but sometimes leaving a trace as -j- or -w-; in other cases there may be either *-k- or the voiced (prenasalized) *-g-:

In Korean, the standard reflex is -0- (at the syllable boundary written as -‘-) or -h-, with distribution as yet unclear; -k- is preserved only in cases of early vowel reduction in the first syllable (*skắr- < *ségi, *skúr < *šṑgV). A few cases that appear to have -k- in a syllable-final position most probably reflect a contraction < *-Vg-Vk, with a frequent velar suffix -k ( < *-k ̔V); thus probably ak-su ‘heavy rain’ < *agak-su (PA *aga); čók ‘bundle’ < *čuguk (PA *č ̔ùgu); čk ‘lye’ < *čuga-k (PA *č ̔ga, cf. PT *čōgak, PTM *čuguk), hók ‘wart’ < *hoge-k (PA *sòge); sik- ‘to cool off’ < *sig-Vk- (PA *šogo, cf. PT *sog-ɨk, Manchu šax- < *sig-ak-), tuk ‘mound, dam’ < *tug-Vk (PA *tógi).

Notes. PA *ŋ- is best preserved in TM. In Turkic, the usual reflex is 0-, but there are a few cases of j- before original diphthongs with -- and *-e-, cf. *jal- < *ŋḕlu, *jānu- < *ŋḗnu-, *jar-ɨn < *ŋḕra, *jebeg < *ŋàbi, *jɨd < *ŋūja. In one quite exceptional case we have *n-, reconstructed in Turkic in just one word, viz. the interrogative pronoun *nē < PA *ŋV. Mongolian has a quite complicated distribution, depending on the following vowel. It must be stressed that the distribution must be quite



74 INTRODUCTION
recent, because the vowels that follow have the timbre acquired already in Mongolian, after the complicated changes of the original PA system. Thus Mongolian has: a) *j- in several cases before original diphthongs: *jeɣü- < *ŋàbi, *ja-(ɣu-) < *ŋV
b) *g- in front of -u-: *gub- < *ŋupu, *gura < *ŋurV, *gu < *ŋ[u] c) *0- in front of -ö-, -ü-: *öle < *ŋōle, *ündü-sü < *ŋŋt ̔e, *öčü- < *ŋṓjču, *üne- < *ŋònŋi-, *ösügeji < *ŋsi, *öjekeji < *ŋje
d) *n- in all other cases: *na-m- < *ŋa, *naji- < *ŋńi, *neɣü- < *ŋḗni, *naŋ-si- < *ŋḗnu, *naran < *ŋḕra, *nagčar-kaj < *ŋàkča, *nokaj < *ŋk ̔u, *nolig < *ŋṑla, *nojir < *ŋju.
Japanese has normally *0-, but in three cases *n- before the following *-n- (original or secondary), probably due to assimilation: *nàs- < *ŋānsa, *nàn-kà- < *ŋṑla(-k ̔V) and *nỼ (*nà-ni) < *ŋV. It appears, however, to have a reflex *m- < *ŋ- before diphthongs, cf. *mùrà-(saki) < *ŋōle, *mt < *ŋŋt ̔e, *m < *ŋàbi, *mmì < *ŋŋe. This evidently means that the combination *ŋ- > *ń- in early Proto-Japanese, because m- is the standard reflex of PA *ń-, see above.

Notes. PA *-ŋ- is a quite frequent phoneme, but its reflexes are not easy to establish, because they have to be separated from the (also frequent) clusters like *-ŋk-, *-ŋg- and *-ŋn-, *-nŋ- (on which see below). In Turkic, *ŋ normally stays unchanged, except a few cases of assimilation (*gemürgen < *geŋürgen < *gaŋu, *bōn-čok < *bōŋ-čok < *mōŋi).



CHAPTER TWO 75
The same is valid for TM, which generally preserves *-ŋ- quite well, but has occasional cases of palatalization *-ŋ- > -n-, -ń- before *i (cf. *būni < *bŋe, *xońi < *k ̔oŋi).
In Mongolian, *-ŋ- has complicated reflexes. It remains unchanged in syllable-final position — with occasional assimilation *-ŋ- > *-n- before dentals: *men-dü < *méŋu, perhaps also *nuntug < *nuŋu. In intervocalic position it is reflected just like PA *-g-, i.e. as *-h- (or -j- before i) in the vast majority of cases. We should note however that Written Mongolian in these cases frequently has not -g-, but -0- ( = -w-), unlike usual PM *-h- ( < PA *-g-), almost always rendered as -g- in Written Mongolian. Some other types of reflexes are also found in certain environments: a) PA *-ŋ- is reflected as *-g- after *n- (rule established by I. Gruntov): *nagaj < *luŋa, *nagaču < *nĕŋu, *nige(n) < *nŏŋe. There may also be some variation in this position: we have both *niɣül ( > Kalm. nǖl) and *nigül ( > Khalkha nügel) from *nắŋe; *nowur-su (Khalkha nōrs, nōs) and *nogur-su (Dong. noGosun etc.) from *nŋu; and only *newne ( = *neɣüne, Khalkha nǖne) from *lòŋe. b) before the following *-ɣ- and *-b- it is reflected as -m-, cf. *simaɣul < *sŋV(-kV), *temeɣel < *t ̔éŋo, *kamar (but also *kabar) < *kaŋ-bar, cf. with standard reflexes of the same root *kaŋ-si-jar, *kaŋ-kul-, *kaɣu-rga-sun.
c) in a few cases before the following -ir-, -ur-, -ul- Mong. has -ŋg- instead of the expected -ɣ- ~ -j-: *aŋgir < *aŋa(tV), *koŋgurčak < *k ̔aŋa, *(h)öŋgür < *p ̔ŏŋe, *öŋgül < *ŏŋe; note also MMong. nuŋɣa-su, WMong. noŋɣa-su < *noŋgur-su together with the attested variants *nogur-su and *nowur-su, see above. In these cases there is no reason to suppose any original clusters, so there must have been a dialect variation between *-ɣ- and *-ŋg- in this position. Korean normally has ŋ in syllable-final position, but -0- (written as -‘- at the syllable boundary) or -ŋ’- in intervocalic position. In a few cases we also encounter assimilated reflexes -m- (*kūm(p)- < *goŋV(ŕV), -ń- (*kíń- < *kŋi, *kɨń- < *kŏŋe) or -n- (*kắnắr < *koŋa-rV, *snɨr < *suŋe-ĺV).
Japanese can reflect *-ŋ- as -n- or -m-, with the rules of distribution so far unclear (as in the case of PA *-ń-, see above). Like other resonants (*r, *l, *m) *-ŋ- can disappear in Japanese in nominal stems before original velar suffixes: *k(u)i < *gaŋ(u)-gV (cf. PT *gemü-rgen), *ía < *iŋV-gV (cf. Manchu joŋgan), *kuá < *kuŋ(i)-gV (cf. Mong. *köw-ɣün ‘son’), *kuà < *k ̔uŋ(u)-gV, *ná- < *lúŋ(a)-gV (cf. Mong. *naga-ji), *mú-i < *méŋ(u)-gV, *nùa < *nùŋ(u)-gV, *túa < *t ̔ŋ(i)-gV, *sa-i < *seŋ(i)-gV (cf. TM *seŋ-gi).



76 INTRODUCTION
2.1.45. The problem of voicing (prenasalization) in Japanese and its consequences for Altaic
While discussing the fate of PA *p ̔ we have paid attention to the fact that the PJ prenasalized reflex *-mp- is correlated with the PM voiced reflex *-b- and that both the voicing in Mongolian and prenasalization in Japanese may have been due to prosodic factors. We have also seen that the majority of cases with -mp- are associated with high pitch (in cases when it can be reconstructed), while the majority of cases with -pare in syllables with low pitch. Let us now try to examine the whole Japanese evidence and see if these conclusions are valid elsewhere, not only for Altaic *-p ̔-. The following preliminary remarks must be made here: Unlike the first syllable, the pitch in the second and following syllables has several restrictions in Japanese: 1. All possible values of pitch are found in disyllabic nouns; 2. In tri-(and more)-syllabic nouns, with very few exceptions, high pitch on the first syllable can only be followed by high pitch; 3. In verbs, with very few exceptions, high pitch can only be followed by high pitch 4. In tri-(and more)-syllabic verbs low pitch can only be followed by low pitch; 5. In adjectives high pitch can only be followed by high pitch, and low pitch can only be followed by low pitch. Voicing (prenasalization) in polysyllabic forms also has one general restriction, namely: two voiced (prenasalized) consonants within one stem are not allowed. It follows that several cases of apparent exceptions may be actually due to the above restrictions: the pitch of the second syllable is irrelevant (neutralized) in trisyllabic nouns like *CỺCỺCỺ (*CỺCỼCỺ is not allowed), in verbs like *CỺCỺ- (*CỺCỼ- is not allowed), in adjectives like *CỺCỺ- or *CỼCỼ- (neither *CỺCỼ-, nor *CỼCỺ- are allowed); absence or presence of nasalization is irrelevant (neutralized) in a structure like *CVCVnCV (*CVnCVnCV is not allowed). Below we shall restrict our observations to relevant structures only. 1. PA voiceless aspirated or voiced stops : PJ voiceless stops

The general picture which emerges is quite curious. We see that there are many more examples with low pitch and voiceless stops (67 cases) than with high pitch and voiceless stops (30 cases); and with high pitch and voiced stops (34 cases) than with low pitch and voiced stops (19 cases). Moreover, of the 30 cases with high pitch and voiceless consonants 22 cases are disyllabic nominal structures of the type *CỺCỺ; and of the 19 cases with low pitch and voiced consonants 15 are disyllabic verbal structures of the type *CỼCỼC-.



78 INTRODUCTION
We may with high probability suppose that there was a tendency in Proto-Japanese for a metatony *CỺCỼ > *CỺCỺ in disyllabic nouns (note that, as we have said above, trisyllabic nouns with low pitch after high pitch are already completely absent); and for a metatony *CỼCỺC> *CỼCỼC- in disyllabic verbs (again, as we have said above, trisyllabic verbs with high pitch after low pitch are already completely absent). If we exclude those cases we get the following distribution of tones and voice (prenasalization) on non-initial syllables:
High Low Voiced 22 4 Voiceless 8 56
It is therefore very probable that voicing (prenasalization) in Proto-Japanese depended on the tone (pitch) of the syllable: high tone caused prenasalization while low tone did not. Since - at least in the series of labial stops - this phenomenon is clearly correlated with voicing in Mongolian (see above), we may safely project this prosodic feature on the Proto-Altaic level, and reconstruct high tone (pitch) where Japanese has prenasalization, and low tone (pitch) where it has none. It is most certain that this conclusion will have far-reaching consequences. Several phenomena (pitch on non-initial syllables in Korean, vowel length on non-initial syllables in Tungus-Manchu; loss or preservation of final vowels in Turkic, Mongolian and Korean) may possibly be explained using this information. But this remains work for the future.
2.2. Development of the PA consonantal system in the daughter la nguages.
2.2.1. Tungus-Manchu.
The TM system appears to be the most archaic. Only the following changes took place: A. Voicing of initial unaspirated dentals: 1. *t- > *d-, *č- > *ǯB. Spirantization of the velar *k ̔ 2. *k ̔ > x C. Loss of the distinction of aspirated vs. unaspirated consonants 3. *p ̔-, *t ̔-, *č ̔- > *p-, *t-, *č4. *-p- > -b-, *-č- > -s



CHAPTER TWO 79
[Note: the latter rule probably means that the affricates in early PTM were phonetically fronted: otherwise we would expect a merger of *-č- with *-š-, not with *-s-.] 5. *-p ̔-, *-t ̔-, *-č ̔- > *-p-, *-t-, *-čD. Loss of *z-: 6. *z- > *sE. Loss of resonants in some structures of the type CR(V): 7. *Cn-, *Cr-, *Cl-, *Cj- > *CF. Loss of palatal *ĺ, *ŕ 8. *ĺ, *ŕ > *l, *r
Note that rules 1-5 are successive; a change in their order would lead to different events. Rule 7 must also precede rule 8 (since *ĺ and *ŕ are never lost, their change to *l, *r must have occurred already after the original *l and *r were lost). But in relation to each other, the groups of rules 1-5 and 7-8, as well as 6 (*z- > *s-) are independent, and could have occurred in any order.
2.2.2. Turkic.
The following processes must have happened resulting in the reconstructed PT system: A. Loss of *š 1. *š- > *č ̔- before back vowels 2. *š > *s elsewhere B. Loss of *p ̔3. *p ̔- > *h- (still present in PT to judge from the Khalaj data, see above) C. Deaffricatization of *č4. *č- > *tD. Loss of initial resonants 5a. *ń- > *ǯ-, *ĺ- > *d5b. *n-, *l- > *d-, *m- > *b-, *ŋ- > 0E. Palatalization of *d-, *z- and *ǯ6. *d-, *z- > *ǯ- > *jF. Loss of aspiration contrast 7. *p- > *b-, *t- > *d-, *k- > *g8. *-p- > -b-, *-k- > -g- [the latter only before -r-] 9. *p ̔ > p, *k ̔ > *k, *č ̔ > *č, *t ̔ > *t [occasionally *t ̔- > *d- before *r, *ŕ, *ĺ]
Rules 1-5a are the earliest, because they are common for Turkic and Mongolian (see below); this is the main reason why we think that the initial resonants were lost not simultaneously, but in two successive steps (first the palatalized, then the rest).



80 INTRODUCTION
Rules 5-8 are specifically Turkic and have to be ordered exactly this way, because otherwise the final system would look quite differently.
2.2.3. Mongolian
Here we must suppose the following sequence of events: A. Loss of *š 1. *š- > *č ̔- before back vowels 2. *š > *s elsewhere B. Loss of *p ̔ 3. *p ̔- > *hC. Deaffricatization of *č4. *č- > *tD. Transformation of resonants 5a. *ń- > *ǯ-, *ĺ- > *d5b. *ŋ- > *0-, *n-, *g- (depending on the following vowel, see above) 5c. *-ŕ- > *-r-, *-ĺ- > -l-, *-ń- > -n- or -j- [the latter with still unclear distribution] E. Loss of *z 6. *z- > *sF. Palatalization of dentals before *i 7. *t ̔ > *č ̔, *t > *č, *d > *ǯ G. Fricativization of *-b-, *-g-, *-ŋ8. *-b- > *-w- [except for positions in clusters and before *k, *g] *-g- > *-h- [except for positions in clusters and before *g] *-ŋ- > *-h- [except for positions in clusters where it stays as *-ŋg-; after *n- where *-ŋ- > -g-; and before *b, *g where *-ŋ- > *-m-] H. Intervocalic Lautverschiebung 9. *-p- > *-b-, *-t- > *-d-, *-k- > *-g- [but not *-č- > *-ǯ-!] 10. *-p ̔- > *-p-, *-t ̔- > *-t-, *-k ̔- > *-k-, *-č ̔- > *-čI. Accent transformation of *p 11. *pỼ > (*fV) > *hV J. Initial Lautverschiebung 12. *p-, *t- > *b-, *d13. *t ̔-, *k ̔-, *č ̔- > *t-, *k-, *č
Rules 1-5a are common Turko-Mongolian (see above). Rules 5b-6 are in fact independent and unordered; they could also be positioned anywhere in between any of the rules 8-13 or even after them.



CHAPTER TWO 81
Rules 7-8 also are independent of each other and their order could be reversed; but they both had to precede the ordered group of rules 9-13.
2.2.4. Japanese
A. Loss of *l-, *ĺ1. *l-, *ĺ- > *n
B. 2. -g- > -ɣ- in the 3d syllable C. Transformation of affricates 3. *č > *č ̔-, -š4. *z, *š > *s 5. *č ̔ > * ̔, *ǯ > * D. Aspiration rules [established by I. Gruntov; Z here denotes any voiced consonant] 6. *CVC ̔V, *ZVC ̔V > *C ̔VC ̔V; *C ̔VCV (not *C ̔VZV) > *C ̔VC ̔V E. Palatalization rules 7. *b > *, *d > *, *g > ǵ after *-diphthongs and before -j8. *ŋ- > *ń- before * F. Prenasalization rule 9. *-C ̔-, *-Z- (not *-C-!) > *-nC- in non-initial syllables with high pitch G. Voice shifts and mergers 10. *b- > *b- before low vowels, *d- > *δ- always 11. (*k > g, *p > b), *t > *d [but * before front vowels] 12. * > *b, * > *δ, *ǵ > *ɣ 13. *C ̔, *Z > *C H. Transformation of resonants 14. *ŋ- > *015. *ŕ > *t before -i, -u 16. *ĺ > *nĺ before *-rV-, *r > *nr before *-rV17. *nr > *nt, *r > *t (sporadically) 18. *ĺ > *s, *ŕ > *r, *l > r, *ń > *ŋ 19. *ŋ > m-, -m- / -nI. Disappearance of voiced fricatives 20. *b > *b-, -w-, *δ > *d-, -j-, *-ɣ- > *-0
The final rule may not in fact be necessary: it depends on our interpretation of the reconstructed PJ system. S. Martin, e.g., prefers to reconstruct *-b- and *-d- in intervocalic position as well, even though OJ and all dialects reflect -w- and -j-; on the other hand, it may be argued



82 INTRODUCTION
that PJ did not have *b- and *d-, but only *w- (*b-) and *j- (*δ-), even though Ryukyu dialects have b- and d- - these all are non-distinctive features. The rules of phonetic development in Japanese are rather complicated and involve a hypothesis about several intermediate steps with assimilations, prenasalizations and palatalizations. Moreover, only rules 1-2 (*l- > *n- and weakening of *-g- in the 3d syllable) are common to Japanese and Korean and distinguish this subgroup both from Turko-Mongolian and Tungus-Manchu. Since both prenasalized consonants (clusters like *-mp-, *-nd- etc.) and palatalized consonants (*, *ǵ) are quite common in Austronesian languages, one might speculate that most phonological changes in the history of Japanese occurred already after the very early split of Korean and Japanese (around the 3d millennium BC) and the subsequent migration of Proto-Japanese to the Japanese archipelago, under the influence of substratum Austronesian languages.
2.2.5. Korean
A. Loss of *l-, *ĺ1. *l-, *ĺ- > *n B. 2. -g- > -ɣ- in the 3d syllable C. Transformation of affricates (3a) *-u- > *-u3b. *s- > *ś- > *h4. *z, *š > *s D. Voice shift 5. *t, *k > *d, *g 6. *-b-, *-d-, *-g- > *-w-, *-r-, *-ɣ7. *C ̔, *Z > *C E. Resonants 8. *ŋ-, *ń- > *n9. *r, *ŕ, *l, *ĺ > *r 10. *-jR- > *-jF. Final dialectal developments 11. *-ɣ- > -h- ~ -012. *-ŋ- > -h- ~ -0
Groups of rules C, D and E are independent of each other and could have happened in any order - but after groups A and B (the only two rules common to Japanese and Korean) and before group F.



CHAPTER TWO 83
2.3. Consonant clusters
Initial consonant clusters are highly atypical for modern Altaic languages (although occasionally they emerge due to vowel loss, as in some Southern Mongolian dialects, Korean and modern Japanese dialects), and were certainly absent in Proto-Altaic. However, medial consonant clusters were fairly common. The most frequent medial clusters are nŋ, rk, ŋg, jb, jr, lg, ĺb, rg, nt, jk ̔, gd, jl, bl, rp ̔, lk ̔, lk, ŋn, kt (each reconstructable at least in five roots). The most typical cluster types are “resonant” + “occlusive”, but we also meet “occlusive” + “resonant”, “resonant” + “resonant” and “o cclusive” + “occlusive”. Here is a complete chart of PA consonant clusters and their reflexes.

It may be noted that some consonants behave differently in clusters than in plain intervocalic position. Exact rules, however, are rather difficult to formulate because of the general instability and rarity of consonant clusters. Especially unstable are the clusters with -j- as the first component: this consonant may leave direct traces in Turkic and TM (but may also disappear without a trace there), but tends to disappear elsewhere. A number of *-j-clusters are reconstructed on indirect evidence: preservation of *-b- (instead of regular *-ɣ-) in Mongolian (where *-jb- thus behaves similarly to *-rb-, *-lb-); fricativization of *-jb-, *-jg- in Japanese; development *-jR- > -0- in Korean. It is also tempting to reconstruct *-j-clusters in two small groups of cases:



90 INTRODUCTION
a) since clusters with *-j- occasionally result in vowel diphthongization in Japanese (cf. the cases *làjp ̔V, *kjta, *k ̔jŕo, *lèjk ̔á), we could reconstruct similar clusters in a few other cases where PJ has *-ia- in the structure *CiaC- (generally very rare), namely, in *dḗlì ‘mane, collar’ ( = *dḗjlì), PJ *(d)iárì; *l[ù]k ̔V ‘wild cat’ ( = *lòjk ̔V, PJ *niàkua), *more ‘hurt, damage’ ( = *mojre or *mojre, PJ *miar-), *p ̔èrì ‘edge’ ( = *p ̔èjrì, PJ *piàrì).
b) since clusters with *-j- occasionally transfer this -j- to the beginning of the syllable in Korean (cf. the cases *č ̔ằjǯV, *k ̔ójŋo, *lèjk ̔á, *mṓjno, *p ̔èjńé, *sajri), we could reconstruct similar clusters in several other cases when Korean has -jə- but without any trace of a PA *--diphthong (which is the usual source of Korean -jə-), namely in *tk ̔ú ‘make a sign’ (= *tjk ̔ú, PK *tjək-), *máŋV ‘go-between’ (= *májŋV, PK *mjnrí), *č ̔ak ̔e ‘forearm’ (= *č ̔ajk ̔e, PK *čjàkái-), *č ̔ēk ̔V ‘k. of cloth’ (= *č ̔ējk ̔V, PK *čjk-), *č ̔ḗp ̔u ‘ulcer’ (= *č ̔ḗjp ̔u, PK *čjūpók), *č ̔[a]ge ‘bast’ (= *č ̔[a]jge, PK *čjòhắi), *dằĺà ‘hide, enclosure’ (= *dằjĺà, PK *tjr), *kesa ‘suffer’ (= *kejsa, PK *kjəs-), *kč ̔á ‘slanting’ (= *kjč ̔á, PK *kjčh), *nèra ‘thin, flat’ (= *nèjra, PK *jr-p-), *ǯap ̔V(ĺV) ‘wormwood’ (= *ǯajp ̔V(ĺV), PK *čjəpɨi-). Absence of the standard development *-jr- > -0- in some of these cases (*k ̔ójŋo, *májŋV, *dằjĺà, *nèjra) could in fact be explained by an early shift of *-j- to a different position within the syllable.
Since these phenomena in Japanese and Korean are difficult to link to each other and to any evidence in other Altaic languages, the reconstruction of *-j- in such cases still remains problematic.
2.4. Vowels
The traditional system of vowel correspondences proposed by Ramstedt and Poppe was already perceived as outdated during the writing of “The Altaic Problem and the Origin of Japanese” (АПиПЯЯ). Further research led to its complete revision. We now suppose that the PA vowel system was completely devoid of vowel harmony which evolved in all the subgroups later as a result of complex interaction between the vowels of the first and the second syllables in polysyllabic roots and derivatives. The system assumed to be Proto-Altaic consisted of five vowels (*i, *e, *u, *o, *a) and three diphthongs (*u, *o, *a), the diphthongs being restricted to the first syllable of the word. The interaction of eight vocalic units of the first syllable and five vocalic phonemes of the second syllable leads to an extremely diverse system of correspondences, of



CHAPTER TWO 91
which the traditional Ramstedt-Poppe correspondences are only a small subset. The diphthongs with *-- are basically reconstructed where Turkic and TM have specific reflexes (*-ia- in Turkic, *-ia- and *-ü- (-iu-) in TM); in several cases, however, diphthongs have been lost in those subgroups as well and can be reconstructed only on circumstantial evidence, see below. The phonetic nature of PA diphthongs is still debatable. We prefer to treat them as diphthongs because they are preserved as such in a number of cases in PT, PTM and Korean, but an interpretation of diphthongs as front vowels could also be possible. In that case, *a = *ä; *o = *ö; *u = *ü. Further research is needed to choose one of these two alternative solutions. The TM system of vowels appears to be the most conservative and was used as a basis of reconstruction. Turkic, Mongolian and Korean usually modify the first vowel under the influence of the second one. Thus, fronted first vowels usually signal that the second vowel was a front one. However the second vowel could also be fronted or shifted to back under the influence of the first vowel, leading to numerous variations in reflexes. Japanese seems to have exclusively assimilated the first vowel to the second one (a process very similar to what later happened in Mongolian), so that the quality of Japanese vowels in the first syllable is normally a good indicator of the original quality of the second vowel, which itself may have been assimilated or disappeared altogether. Vowels of the non-initial syllable are generally very unstable in all modern Altaic languages. They tend to become assimilated to initial vowels, are frequently contracted in various combinations with following suffixes, and are often lost completely. They are best preserved in Tungus-Manchu languages and completely lost in the majority of Turkic and Korean roots. The situation therefore is very close, e.g., to Germanic or to the Nakh languages in the Eastern Caucasus, where the quality of non-initial vowels can now only be recovered on the basis of umlaut processes in the first syllable. Thus, the approach we have chosen - reconstructing non-initial vowels on indirect evidence (the way they have influenced the vowels that preceded them) - seems to be the only possible solution. Rules for individual development of non-initial vowels in particular subbranches of Altaic have yet to be established, and depend substantially on a future analysis of verbal and nominal morphophonemics and accent systems. Below we list the vocalic correspondences between the Altaic languages. In the Proto-Altaic column we list all recoverable combinations



92 INTRODUCTION
of the first and second syllable vowels. The notation U in PTM, PM and MKor. means that any of the two back rounded vowels - u or o - can act as a reflex, due to frequent variation between u/o in those languages. Similarly, the notation A in MKor. means that either a or ə can act as a reflex (due to very frequent a/ə variation in Korean). The notation P stands for any labialized consonant (modifying adjacent vowels in Mongolian and Turkic) and R - for any liquid resonant (conditioning the development of closed / open vowels in Turkic).

2.4.1. PA *a
PTM *a - PJ *a
This correspondence indicates the PA sequence *CaCa, and is usually rather stable. All languages normally have *a here, with the following exceptions: 1. Turkic normally has *a, but in a few cases - closed *ạ: *ắla > *ạl-, *bằka > *bạk-, *dắgá > *jạgu-k, *k ̔sa > *Ksɨk, *mana > *bạnɨ-, *p ̔ắt ̔à(-kV) > *ạtkɨm, *p ̔ra > *r-, *p ̔t ̔à > *ạt-. Usually this development is observed after historical labials, but the distribution is not quite strict (cf. *ắla, *dắgá and *k ̔sa above; cf., on the other hand, *p ̔là > *ala-, *p ̔āda > *adɨ-, *p ̔ăp ̔a > *apa-, *pàt ̔á > *bat-, *bra > *bār, *bāla > *bāla). 2. Korean has both a and ə, cf.
a) *agà > *ak-su, *ák ̔à > *àk-, *alda > *arăm, *ălpa > *àrphằ-, *áp ̔a > *àpí, *āŕa > *ārắi, *dasa- > *tàs-, *kāma > *kàmóthi, *k ̔ápa > *kàph-, *k ̔p ̔à > *kàph(but also *kph-), *k ̔sa > *kàsằm, *mana > *mān(h)-, *màra > *mār-, *mára > *mar-, *nát ̔a > *nāt, *pala > *par, *pằlgà > *pár, *pàt ̔á > *pàt-, *pák ̔à > *pàk-, *p ̔át ̔à > *pàt(h), *p ̔ắt ̔à(-kV) > *pàtók, *p ̔ra > *parh-, *p ̔t ̔à > *pat-, *sằja > *sāi-, *sápa > *sàpók, *sàrp ̔a > *sárp, *tắĺbà > *tàră-, *tăra > *tār, *t ̔àjrá > *tājà, *t ̔aŋnà > *tàŋ’àrí, *t ̔la > *tàr’ái-, *t ̔āma > *tám b) *ála > *r-, *ant ̔a(gV) > *ntk, *bra > *pr-, *gằt ̔a > *kt-, *k ̔aŋa > *k’úč, *k ̔ăra > *kjr, *láčà > *nčhúr, *p ̔là > *pr(h)
3. Japanese, as we said, normally has *a in this type of correspondences. However, it should be borne in mind that Japanese hardly tolerates *a and *ə within one morpheme. Therefore, a small group of cases



94 INTRODUCTION
where Japanese has *ə in the second syllable — probably because of some prehistoric vowel contractions that are hardly recoverable in detail — reveal also *ə, not *a, in the first syllable, cf.: *tắĺbà > *ds, *zàrá > *st, *ǯắra > *dr-.
PTM *a - PJ *ə
Except for the three cases listed above, this correspondence indicates the PA sequence *CaCe (in Japanese *CaCe > *CeCe > *CəCV). Other languages have the following reflexes here: 1. Mongolian has either *a or a fronted reflex *i/e:
a) *ắk ̔è > *(h)aki-, *ámbe > *(h)amban, *le > *al-, *káče > *kači, *kaje > *kaji-, *kăp ̔è > *kaji-či, *kare > *kar-bu-, *kaserV > *kasirag, *kt ̔e > *katari-, *k ̔àpe > *kab-, *máĺe > *malur, *pt ̔e > *batagana, *sarp ̔e > *sarbaɣa, *t ̔ằgè > *taji-la; b) *āńe(-č ̔V) > *eje, *en-; *k ̔re > *kira, *làlè > *nila-, *ĺk ̔è > *ǯekej, *mak ̔é > *mek(e)-, *màlt ̔e > *meltür- > *möltür-, *ńam(ń)ekt ̔V > *ǯimuɣu-su, *sagè > *siɣu-g-, *tde > *čidör, *zagè > *seg (on the distribution of *e and *i see below). 2. Turkic normally has *a- in Anlaut, but *-ɨ- after a consonant, cf.: *ắk ̔è > *(i)aku-ru-, *ale > *ăl, *le > *ăl- (but also *āńe-č ̔V > *Enč); but *čkte > *Tt, *č ̔ak ̔e > *čɨkan, *káče > *Kɨča, *kaje > *Kɨj-, *kằle > *Kɨlɨč, *kaŋne > *Kɨna, *kăp ̔è > *Kɨp-, *kare > *Kɨrɨĺ, *kaserV > *Kɨsɨr, *kt ̔e > *Ktɨr-, *k ̔re > *Kɨrɨg, *làlè > *jɨlɨk > *jilik, *máĺe > *bɨnĺɨk, *nable > *jɨlɨm, *ńàme > *jɨmga, *ńam(ń)e- > *jɨmurt, *nne > *jn, *pt ̔e > *bɨt, *sagè > *sɨgɨt-, *sarp ̔e > *sɨp, *tde > *dd-, *zagè > *jɨg-.
3. Korean also has a split into back *a and front *ə:
a) *ale > *àrái, *āńe(-č ̔V) > *ànč-, *ńam(ń)e-kt ̔V > *nàmòk, *pt ̔e > *pátắrí, *pàńé > *pám, *k ̔ač ̔e > *kàčí. b) *le > *rí-, *kt ̔e > *kthí-, *ĺk ̔è > *nək-, *mak ̔é > *mk-, *ńàme > *jm-, *tde > *tət.
PTM *a - PJ *i
This correspondence reflects the sequence *CaCi, with a variation of back and front reflexes in other languages. 1. Turkic has normally *e, but also *a:
a) *ăĺi > *ẹĺit-, *ălgi > *ĕlge-, *ắni > *eŋ, *jbi > *Ebür(d)ek, *ni > *en, *ni > *ēn-čü, *bdì > *bEd-, *brì > *bEr-, *bri > *bẹr, *čărikV > *dẹrek, *č ̔ăk ̔i > *čekü-rtke, *č ̔ali > *čEl, *č ̔ki > *čEket, *dli > *jẹlim, *gt ̔ì > *gē(j)t-, *kăči > *geč-, *kaji > *gejik, *kk ̔i > *Kēk-, *kami > *KEmek, *kăpi > *gebre-, *kk ̔i > *gēkir-, *k ̔ádí(-rV) > *KEdir-, *k ̔ăĺi > *keĺ, *k ̔ắsi > *kes-,

*k ̔ăsi > *kes-, *màjŋì > *bejŋi, *ŋli > *el, *pli > *bẹldir, *p ̔dì > *diĺ, *p ̔aĺi > *ẹĺ, *p ̔nŋi > *ēŋe-, *p ̔t ̔i > *ētük, *sắbi > *sEbrük, *sajri > *ser-, *saĺ(b)i > *seĺ-, *săp ̔í > *sep-, *sàp ̔ì > *sEp, *sč ̔i > *sEč-, *ski > *sēk-, *sŕi > *sEŕ-, *t ̔ki > *TEk-, *zăli > *jẹl.
Among more or less secure examples there are 22 cases of open *e and 8 cases of closed *ẹ.
b) *álikV > *Ălaŋɨr, *àŕì > *aŕɨg, *pi > *Abɨ-, *gi > *gu, *li > *Āl, *at ̔i > *Atɨ, *bási > *basɨg, *bằt ̔í > *bat-, *dằgì > *jagɨ, *dằk ̔ì > *jAk-ɨn, *dắsi > *jAs-, *gắli > *K(i)al, , *kádì(rV) > *Kadɨr, *kărsi > *KArsak, *láp ̔ì > *jap-, *maji > *baj, *màli > *baltu, *mli > *bAlɨg, *lami > *jAmak, *pằsi > *bas-, *pli > *bālɨk, *p ̔ágdi > *adak, *p ̔ắsi > *as-, *saji > *sAj-, *sali > *sal-, *sằmpi > *sAP, *sằp ̔i ̔ > *sapak, *saŕi > *sAŕak, *tbi > *dabul, *t ̔aŋgiri > *taŋrɨ (but also *teŋri), *t ̔ari > *tArakaj, *zakt ̔i > *jạtŕuk, *ǯli > *jĀl-.
Note that closed *ạ is quite rare here (only 2 cases as opposed to 16 cases of open *a). 2. Mongolian can also have front reflexes i/e or a back reflex *a:
a) *gi > *eɣe-de-, *čărikV > *čirgaj, *č ̔ki > *čigör-, *dagi > *deɣüren, *dari > *dereji-, *dli > *ǯil-, *gt ̔ì > *getül- (but also *gatul-), *kádì(rV) > *keder, *kk ̔i > *kek-, *kami > *kemerlig, *kăpi > *kebere, *kărsi > *kirsa, *kk ̔i > *kekere- (but also *kakira-), *k ̔ádí(-rV) > *kederge, *k ̔pri > *keɣürge, *màli > *milaɣa, *mli > *milan, *lami > *limbaj, *pli > *bilaɣu, *pli > *belčir, *pasi > *hesüre-, *p ̔āji > *hejil-, *saji > *seji-le-, *saĺ(b)i > *sel(b)(but also *salb-), *sắp ̔í > *sibeɣe, *săp ̔í > *sibere- (but also *sabir-), *saŕi > *ser-, *sč ̔i > *seče-, *ski > *sege-, *sŕi > *seri-, *t ̔ari > *čirükej. [Note that *i usually occurs before *-a-, *-ö- and *-u-, while *e occurs before *i, *e and *ü, thus *sibeɣe and *sibere- must go back to earlier *siböɣe and *siböre-]. b) *ăĺi > *al-dar, *álikV > *(h)alag-, *ắni > *aŋ-ka, *àŕì > *ariɣa, *pi > *abu-ra-, *li > *aliɣa, *ni > *anǯu, *at ̔i > *ači, *bằt ̔í > *bat-ga, *bdì > *badara, *brì > *baraɣun, *bri > *baraɣa, *dằgì > *dajin, *dằk ̔ì > *daka-, *dắsi > *dasinga, *gắli > *galǯaɣu, *kanti > *kančir, *k ̔ăĺi > *kali-sun, *k ̔ắsi > *kasu-, *lằŋi > *laji, *láp ̔ì > *labta-, *màjŋì > *maŋlai, *ŋńì > *naji-, *p ̔ágdi > *(h)adag, *p ̔ắsi > *(h)asa-, *p ̔nŋi- > *hana-, *sajri > *sar(b)a-, *sằmpi > *samba-gan, *sằp ̔í > *sabaga, *t ̔ắk ̔ì > *taki-, *t ̔aŋgiri > *taŋgarag, *t ̔ájri- > *tara-, *zăli > *salki, *ǯli- > *ǯala-.
In a few cases (*dàli > *dölü, *tbi > *düjiren, *č ̔ăk ̔i > *čoku), the vowel becomes labialized under the influence of secondary labialization of the second syllable (caused probably by an original labial suffix like *-bV- > -wV-: *dàli-bV > *dàli-w- > *delü- > *dölü etc.).
Mongolian and Turkic evidence displays a large number of e/a doublet readings, showing that the split into front and back variants in Turkic and Mongolian is secondary, probably caused by the old dialec

tal variant development *CaCi > *CeCE vs. *CaCi > *CaCA. In general there is no direct correlation between front and back reflexes in Turkic and Mongolian; we find that Turkic slightly prefers front reflexes (44 cases of *e vs. 36 cases of *a), while Mongolian rather favours back reflexes (33 cases of *a vs. 29 cases of *e, plus 4 cases with a variation *e/a). 3. Korean, too, has a split into *a and *ə, but also has a number of *i-reflexes:
a) *ăĺi > *ār-, *ắni > *àńí, *ni > *an-, *ni > *ān-, *at ̔i > *àtắr, *brì- > *pàrằ-, *bri > *pār, *dàli > *tàr-, *kàji > *kāi-, *kk ̔i > *kài’ò-, *k ̔ắsi- > *kàsk- (but also *ksk-), *láp ̔ì > *nàp- (but also *np-), *màli > *már, *pli > *par-, *pasi > *pàs-, *p ̔t ̔i > *pàtì, *saŋe > *sài’ó-, *sằp ̔í > *sap-, *sŕi > *sari-, *zakt ̔i > *sàt, *zăli > *sarb) *pli > *pr-, *sajri > *sjə-, *saĺ(b)i > *sər-, *sắp ̔í > *sp c) *pi > *ìpà-tí, *li > *ìr-bń-, *dắsi > *tìsài, *ŋńì > *nīń-, *pańi > *pìń-, *sali > *sirh-, *t ̔ájri > *tí-.
PTM *a - PJ *u
This correspondence reflects the PA sequence *CaCu. Other languages have the following reflexes: 1. Turkic predominantly has *a (*tāt < *t ̔t ̔u, *daŋ- < *tằnŋù, *saran < *saru, *samala < *sằmù, *sakɨrtka < *sak ̔u(rV), *bańak- < *mańuk ̔V, *Kara < *kàru, *Kadgu < *gằju, *čal- < *č ̔àlù, *dal < *čălù, *āń < *ńu, *aglak < *ăgu-la).
Closed *ạ is attested, however, in *jŕ- < *lŕgu; and in some trisyllables before -u- we have a secondary labialization -a- > -o- (*jogurgan < *dáku, *bokursɨ < *bk ̔u).
2. Mongolian has *a, but may also reveal labialized reflexes u/o:
a) *ăgu-la > *aɣula, *apuči > *(h)abisu-n, *mú > *(h)ama-n, *bk ̔ù > *baki, *čălù > *daldaw, *č ̔abu > *čaɣur, *č ̔àlù > *čali, *gằju > *gaj, *kádù > *kada-, *kàru > *kara, *k ̔ăp ̔ù > *kaɣa-, *làku > *lag, *làk ̔ù > *naki-, *lŕgu > *nargi-, *mált ̔u > *malta-, *pằluk ̔V > *haluka, *sak ̔u(rV) > *sag, *sarču > *čarča-, *saru > *sar-, *sagu > *sag-su, *šŋu > *čaŋ, *tàbù > *daɣ-, *tagù > *dagna-, *tbú > *daɣa-, *t ̔ámu > *tama-, *t ̔ằŋu > *taɣu, *t ̔t ̔u > *tačir, *ǯap ̔ù > *ǯaɣa-; b) *ằk ̔ú > *uku-, *bagu > *buɣurul, *balu > *bulagan, *č ̔ābu > *čuw, *gàtù > *gudu- (but also *godu), *káč ̔u > *kuči-, *kalu > *kul-, *knu > *kuna, *k ̔ap ̔u > *kubilǯagana, *mańuk ̔V > *munig, *ńabĺu-čV > *ǯulǯa-gan, *saŋu(ńV) > *suwnag;



CHAPTER TWO 97
c) *ăbu > *owči, *ăŋu > *oɣuna, *ńu > *oji(n), *bāku > *bog, *čamu > *dom, *k ̔ăču > *kočur-, *k ̔áru > *kormu-sun, *ńargu- > *ǯorgul, *sarumV > *sormu-, *šalpu > *čolbun, *t ̔ák ̔ù > *toki, *t ̔aklu > *togli, *t ̔ànŋú > *tonu3. Korean displays similar reflexes: normally *a or *ə, but occasionally also *u or *o:
a) *àlu > *àr- (but also *r-); *káč ̔u > *kàč, *làk ̔ù > *náks, *màlù > *maru, *tằnŋù > *tan, *t ̔ák ̔ù > *tàk, *t ̔ámu > *tām-, *ǯap ̔ù > *čàp-; b) *gằju > *kəi’əm, *mańuk ̔V > *mijùkí, *sarumV > *səm, *šàčú > *čs, *t ̔t ̔u > *tti; c) *bagu > *pùhi-, *čălù > *čùr-kí, *kádù > *kùr’i, *mált ̔u > *mùt-, *maru > *muri; d) *knu > *kón, *k ̔ằkú > *koāŋ, *k ̔áru > *kòró, *lŕgu > *nòrắs, *tàbù > *tòbi-.
In a certain number of words seemingly pointing to *CaCa (with TM *a and Jpn. *a) Mongolian unexpectedly displays front *i or *e; Turkic has *o; and Korean has *ă or labialized *o, *u (typical for PA *o, see below). It seems appropriate to reconstruct here the type *CaCo, with secondary merger of *CaCo and *CaCa in Japanese. The following comments are needed here:
1. Turkic normally has *o (with occasional narrowing > *u in contact with labials, cf. *um- < *ắmo, *budur- < *bădo, *buta- < *bằtò, *Kumɨŕ < *kàmo, *jum- < *nmo). For the *o reflex cf. *t ̔aso > *tosun, *t ̔ăp ̔o(rV) > *topra-k, *tŋo > *doŋuŕ, *tago > *dogra-, *sāmo > *som, *sáŕo > *soŕak, *p ̔ap ̔o > *op-la, *ńamo > *jo[m], *ńằmò > *jom-, *mro > *bōr, *măndo > *botu, *k ̔no > *Kon-, *k ̔alo > *Kolaŋ, *k ̔ăbo > *Kob-, *karmo > *kor-daj, *kalt ̔o > *Kolak, *kak ̔o > *Kokɨ-, *kàbro > *Kor, *gămo > *Koma, *č ̔áko > *čok, *člo > *dōl-, *čágo > *ToK-, *ŋo > *oŋ, *àpo > *obu-.
In the following cases, however, we find the reflex *a: *čAm < *č ̔amo, *čar < *č ̔àro, *čārba- < *č ̔mro, *Kalɨm < *kălo, *KAĺak < *k ̔ằĺo, *jaba < *làbò, *jaba < *ĺábó, *jĀmčɨk < *lmo, *jAŋgak < *ńaŋo, *ajɨt- < *p ̔ajo, *sag- < *săjgo, *saja- < *sajo, *sargan < *sáro, *jala- < *ǯắlo.
It is easy to see that with few exceptions the *a-reflex is present in the vicinity of Turkic palatals *j, *č or *ĺ. 2. Mongolian, as said above, has normally *a, but rather frequently also the fronted reflexes *i or *e:
a) *ắmo > *ama-, *talo > *dalu, *dali, *kak ̔o > *kaku-, *kălo > *kala-, *kalt ̔o > *kalta-s (but also *kelte-), *kamp ̔o > *kamki-, *k ̔ăbo > *kaɣur-, *k ̔ằĺo > *kal-, *k ̔no > *kani, *labo > *lab / *naj, *lmo > *nambuga, *măndo > *manǯi, *ma[k ̔]o > *makiji-, *mro > *mara-, *ńằmò > *ǯaɣu-n, *p ̔ádo > *(h)adar, *p ̔ajo > *haɣu-, *p ̔ap ̔o > *hawl-, *săjgo > *saɣa-, *salo > *sal(u)-,



98 INTRODUCTION
*tago > *daɣa-, *ǯắlo > *ǯalga-. [In *kowr < *kàbro and *toɣur- < *t ̔ăp ̔o(rV) we see a secondary assimilative labialization *a > *o].
b) *aǯo > *(h)iǯe, *bašo > *bisi-ɣu, *č ̔abo > *čibka, *č ̔amo > *čima-, *č ̔aŋo > *čiɣul-, *č ̔mro > *čindaga, *kàmo > *kimur, *ńamo > *ǯim, *ńaŋo > *ǯiɣag, *nmo > *(n)im, *sábó > *sibe-gčin, *sáŕo > *siröge, *sŕo(-gV) > *siröge c) *ằjbo > *ebe-sü, *àpo > *ebe-, *ŋo > *eŋge-, *člo > *del-, *kábó > *keji-d, *ĺábó > *debeɣe, *màsò > *mese, *pap ̔ó > *(h)eb, *sago > *seɣü-der, *sằŋo > *seɣü-, *sáro > *sere-, *t ̔āno > *teneji-.
A secondary labialization occurred in *bödüne < *bedüne < *bădo, *söɣem < *seɣü-m < *sajo.
The general rules of distribution between *i and *e are the same as in the types *CaCe, *CaCi, i.e. *i usually before *-a-, *-ö- and *-u-, while *e - before *i, *e and *ü; thus *sibe-gčin must go back to earlier *sibö-gčin; less clear are the examples *(h)iǯe ( < *(h)iǯö?) and *bisi-ɣu ( < *bisö-ɣu?; note also the strange variant *busi-ɣu). The rules of choice between back *a and front *i/*e, however, remain unclear. 3. Korean, as said above, has either *ă or, less frequently, *o/*u:
a) *člo > *čăra-, *č ̔amo > *čhắm-, *č ̔àro > *čărɨ-, *dalo > *tằr-, *tàńo > *tń-, *talo > *tằr’ái, *kălo > *kắr-, *kalt ̔o > *kằrằ-, *kamp ̔o > *kắm-, *karmo > *kằrmjkí, *k ̔ằĺo > *kắr, *làbò > *năboi, *lmo > *nằmằčh, *ma[k ̔]o > *mằi-, *p ̔ádo > *pằrằm, *pró > *phắr-, *sago > *sằ-n, *săjgo > *sắi-, *salo > *sắr-, *sáĺo > *sằràŋ, *sáńo > *sằńí, *ǯắlo > *čằrằ-, *pát ̔o > *pằtằi; b) *gămo > *kòmá, *kàbro > *kòr-, *kábó > *kò’ắr, *k ̔alo > *koraŋ, *mro > *mòr’ái, *tŋo > *to’a-; c) *č ̔abo > *čūb-, *p ̔ajo > *pūi-.
2.4.2 PA *e
PTM *e - PJ *a
This correspondence reflects PA *CeCa. Other languages have the following reflexes: 1. Turkic can have both *a and *e:
a) *bĕŕa > *bAŕ-, *dkà > *jak-, *dlp ̔à > *jalpɨ, *èk ̔á > *agsa-, *eńa > *ańɨg, *ńa > *ana (but also *eńe), *eńa > *ańak, *ĕp ̔a > *apa(j), *erka > *Arka-, *ēda > *Ada, *ḗŕa > *āŕ-, *gḕnŋa > *KAŋɨr-, *kelta(rV) > *KArtal, *kéra > *Kạrɨn, *kḕnda > *KAt, *kč ̔á > *KAč-, *k ̔éŕà > *Kaŕ, *k ̔éma > *Kamɨĺ, *k ̔épà > *Kaptal, *k ̔ta > *KAtar-, *leńa > *jAń-ka-, *mĕŋa > *baŋ-, *nèra > *jAr-, *ŋḕrá > *jạrɨn, *pélaba(nV) > *bAlbal, *p ̔ép ̔a > *Apač-, *p ̔ḗra > *ārɨ, *p ̔ḗta > *āt-, *sēma > *sAm-, *šek ̔a > *sakak, *tēga > *dāg, *tḗla > *dāl-, *t ̔p ̔a > *TAp-la-, *t ̔ŕa > *dAŕ, *t ̔ḕbà > *tabɨĺ-, *zèjńa > *jaŋɨ (but also

*jeŋi), *zēra > *jar-, *ǯela > *jAla, *ǯèmá > *jam, *ǯḗja > *jāj, *tert ̔a > *dart-, *zela > *jạla-ŋuk. b) *tḗma > *dēmin, *dék ̔à > *jEken, *ĕbà > *ebs-, *ĕda > *ed, *ēŋa(k ̔V) > *ēŋ, *ra > *er-, *ḗjba > *ēb-, *ḗna(kV) > *ēn, *ḗra > *Ērig, *ḗt ̔a > *ēt-, *gla > *gEle-ĺč-, *gèná > *gEne, *gék ̔á > *Kek-, *kéma > *Kemeke, *kemŕa > *kEbŕe, *kḗjna > *gĒne, *kḗp ̔à > *gēp, *k ̔ébá > *gEbre, *k ̔èpà > *kebü-, *méŋa > *bEŋiŕ, *mḗča > *bĒčin, *nema > *jem-, *ńĕra > *jẹr, *pédá > *bEdiŕ, *p ̔ḕtá > *et, *t ̔éba > *Teb, t ̔èk ̔á > *tek-, *t ̔eŋa > *TEŋ-, *t ̔ĕp ̔á > *tepö, *t ̔ḕŋà > *tEŋ, *t ̔èp ̔à > *TEpiŕ.
Note that closed *ạ and *ẹ are very rare here and occur only before *-rand *l (*Kạrɨn, *jạrɨn, *jẹr, *jạlaŋuk).
2. Mongolian also can have both *a and *e:
a) *dlp ̔à > *dalba-, *ĕda > *ada-, *èk ̔á > *(h)agsa-, *eńa > *ajaga(n), *erka > *arga-, *ēda > *(h)ada, *ḗjba > *(h)abad, *ḗra > *ar-, *gḕnŋa > *gana-, *kelta(rV) > *kaltar, *kḕnda > *kandagaj, *k ̔éŕà > *kajir(a)-, *k ̔éma > *kamgar, *k ̔eŋa > *kaŋka-, *k ̔épà > *kabta-su, *k ̔ta > *kadaga-la, *lḗńa > *naji-, *mék ̔à > *mak-, *méŋa > *maji-kai, *nèra > *nari-n, *nèra > *nara-su, *ŋḕrá > *naran, *pélaba(nV) > *barimal, *pép ̔à > *baɣa-su, *p ̔ép ̔a > *haba-kai, *p ̔ḗta > *(h)ada-, *p ̔ḕtá > *(h)adaska, *sēma > *samur-, *šek ̔a > *sakaɣu, *t ̔ja > *tajibu-, *t ̔ek ̔a > *taka, *t ̔eŋa > *taŋga-, *t ̔p ̔a > *taɣ-, *t ̔ŕa > *tarbalǯi, *t ̔ḕbà > *tawlai, *zēra > *sara, *ǯela > *ǯali-, *ǯèmá > *ǯamug, *méra > *maril, *tert ̔a > *tata-.
b) *bĕŕa > *berele-, *tḗma > *demej (also with secondary labialization *demü > *dömü-), *dék ̔à > *dek-, *èbla > *(h)eɣülde, *eńa > *ende-, *ĕp ̔a > *ebej, *ép ̔á > *eb-, *ra > *ere-, *ḗna(kV) > *eŋ, *ḗŕa > *ereɣü, *gèná > *gene-, *gék ̔á > *gek-, *kemŕa > *kemde-, *kèra > *kere-, *kḗp ̔à > *keɣe, *kč ̔á > *keč, *k ̔ébá > *keɣür, *k ̔èpà > *kebe, *lèjk ̔á > *neke-, *mĕŋa > *meŋde-, *mḗča > *mečin, *nema > *neme-, *pédá > *beder, *p ̔ḗra > *herbe-kei, *séjra > *sereɣe, *sèdá > *sede-, *tēga > *deɣe-, *t ̔éba > *tew-ke, *t ̔èk ̔á > *teg-si, *t ̔ĕp ̔á > *tebeg (but also *tab), *t ̔ḕpá > *teberi-, *t ̔èp ̔à > *tebči-.
There are also several cases of *i (before *j: *lḕja > *niɣe-, *zèjńa > *sine; and also *ńĕra > *ǯir(u)-, *sép ̔à > *siɣüre- < *siɣöre-?). The general distribution of *e and *i is here more or less the same as in the types *CaCe, *CaCi (see above): *e occurs only before *e and *ü; but final *-a, -u and *-ö (also *-i) are extremely rare in this type, so that the expected reflex *-i- is very rare, too. It probably means that the type *CeCa was very early transformed into *CeCe (or *CaCa), while *CaCe first changed into *CaCi.
It is also worth noting that, unlike the type *CaCe where fronting in Turkic and Mongolian must have been an independent process (the correlation between Turkic *e and Mong. *e in that type is more or less



100 INTRODUCTION
random), here we find a largely interdependent development: in most cases when Mong. has *a, Turkic also has *a (25 cases against 9 cases of Mong. *a - Turk. *e), and in most cases when Mong. has *e, Turkic also has *e (16 cases against 9 cases of Mong. *e - Turk. *a). This probably means that the process of splitting *CeCa into *CaCa / *CeCe started earlier than the process of splitting *CaCe (on which see above); but the conditioning factors for it still remain unclear. 3. Korean, as always, has a double reflex: *a or *ə:
a) *bétà > *pàdắr, *tḗma > *tāmái-n, *dék ̔à > *tái (?), *dĕp ̔a > *tàpók-, *èbla > *árh, *éča > *àčhắm, *eńa > *āń-, *ḗna(kV) > *ánh, *ḗra > *ar-, *kéma > *kàmá, *kéra > *kari, *k ̔ébà > *kai, *mék ̔à > *màk-, *ŋḕrá > *nár, *lḕja > *ná-, *pép ̔à > *pap, *tḗla > *tarh-, *t ̔ĕp ̔á > *tapar, *zèjńa > *sái. b) *ńa > *ńí, *ép ̔á > *əp-, *erka > *rk-, *ḗŕa > *rjb-, *kḗjna > *ki, *kč ̔á > *kjčh, *lèjk ̔á > *njkí-, *nema > *nm-, *p ̔ḗra > *pr-, *séjra > *si(h), *tēga > *tə-, *t ̔ep ̔à > *tph-, *t ̔ḕpá > *tpr-, *zēra > *sr, *kéč ̔à > *kčh, *méra > *mr’úi.
4. Japanese, as we said above, has a uniform *a. Since PJ *a and *ə are hardly compatible in one morpheme, almost none of the words in question have an *ə in the second syllable here, except for one case: PA *ǯèmá > PJ *dm(n)kui, where as a result the first vowel became secondarily assimilated (on some similar cases < PA *CaCa see above). Another similar case may be *čĕk ̔a > PJ *təkə (although here a reconstruction *čĕk ̔o can not be entirely excluded; on the type *CeCo see below).
PTM *e - PJ *ə
This correspondence (except for the irregular case with *ǯèmá, on which see above), indicates PA *CeCe. Other languages have the following reflexes: 1. Turkic uniformly has *e, with the open and closed variants distributed in the following way:
a) *me > *eme, *k ̔éĺe > *keĺč, *sebe > *seb, *tp ̔é > *depre-, *t ̔égè(-rV) > *Tegre b) *gle > *gẹl-, *grè(bV) > *gẹr-tü
In one case, viz. *(j)īn-čik < *p ̔èjńé, we observe a narrowed *-i-reflex, probably conditioned by the medial -j-. After initial *j- ( < *n-) there may also appear back *a (*ạ): cf. *nmè > *jama-, *np ̔é > *jap-, *nre > *jạr-.
The distribution between *e and *ẹ, *a and *ạ here seems to be conditioned by the following consonant: closed variants appear before *r and *l, open variants are found elsewhere.



CHAPTER TWO 101
2. Mongolian, too, uniformly has *e, except in the position after *j(*ja-su < *jan-su < *p ̔èjńé). Just as in the case of *CeCa, *-i- could be possible, but the only attested cases here are with the vowels *-e-, *-i- or *-ü- in the second syllable (*eme < *me, *ečige < *t ̔è, *gere(-ɣe) < *grè(bV), *kenǯe < *kènǯé, *kewü- < *k ̔p ̔è, *deglej < *ĺekleKV, *nebse- < *np ̔é, *nere < *nre, *selü- < *séle, *debi- < *tp ̔é).
We see thus that PA *CeCe behaves exactly like the fronted variant of *CaCe, see above. 3. Korean has reflexes similar to those of *CaCi, i.e. basically *a or *ə, but also a number of *i and *ɨ-reflexes: a) *me > *ám, *t ̔è > *àtắ, *gle > *ká-; b) *bè > *p-, *séle > *sr; c) *kejbe > *kìbúr, *np ̔é > *nìp-, *nre > *(n)ìrh-, *nìră-, *sése > *sìs-kú-, *sebe > *sìp-; d) *grè(pV) > *kr, *neč ̔è > *nč-.
PTM *e - PJ *i
This correspondence reflects the type *CeCi, and other languages have the following reflexes: 1. as in the case of *CeCe, Turkic has a more or less uniform reflex *e, with the open and closed variants distributed in the following way: a) *gdì > *ged, *gérki > *Kerke-, *kŋi > *geŋiŕ, *kḗči > *gēč, *ŋḗni > *ēn-, *pk ̔i > *bek, *télki > *Tel(k)-, *dḗlì > *jēl; b) *k ̔èlńí > *kẹli, *tḕrì > *dẹri, *ǯḕri > *jẹr-;
The rules of distribution appear similar to those in the type *CeCe, i.e. closed *ẹ before *r, *l, open *e elsewhere (however, several cases of open *e before *r,*l - *Kerke, *Tel, *jēl - are also attested). Just as in the case of *CeCe there are some examples of -a- after *j(cf. *zep ̔i > *jap-, *ǯebí > *jAb); cf. also *nébì > *jub-ga, probably a vowel metathesis < *jab-gu. We see that in general the type *CeCi behaves in Turkic very similarly to *CeCe; but there are a few attested cases where Turkic has a narrow *-i- here: *bèli > *bil- (but in a derivative: *bel-gü); *dḕgni > *(j)igne, *p ̔edí > *idi; *sni > *sin-čök; *sejŋi > *siŋil. 2. Mongolian has either *e or *i:
a) *bèli > *bele-, *dlp ̔i > *delbe-, *dḗli > *del, *gdì > *gede, *kŋi > *keŋ-, *kḗči > *keči-, *ńéŋńi > *ǯeɣü-n, *ŋḗni > *neɣü-, *ségì > *seg-l-, *sḗmi > *seme-, *télki > *deleg, *néji > *nej, *éli > *el-, *dḕgni > *ǯeɣü-wün. b) *gérki > *girgawl, *k ̔èmì > *kim, *ĺḕgì > *ǯig-, *nébì > *niɣu-n, *neji > *ni-sa-, *peč ̔i > *hiče-, *p ̔edí > *hide, *pk ̔i > *hike, *p ̔émi > *himer-, *p ̔èrì

> *hir-, *seri > *sireɣe, *tḕrì > *čiraj, *t ̔ḗk ̔í > *čig, *ǯḕri > *ǯirke-, *ǯebí > *ǯib-.
The general distribution rules of *i and *e (*-i- before *a, *u and *ö; *-e- before *e, *i and *ü) are somewhat violated here by a relatively large number of CiCe (hiče-, hide, hike, himer-, sireɣe, ǯirke). The reason for this development is yet to be established. 3. Korean has exactly the same reflexes as in the type *CeCe:
a) *ŋḗni > *nàń(ắ-), *sḗmi > *sām, *sejŋi > *sjā’òŋ, *sési > *sàsắm, *sḕmi > *sàm-, *t ̔kí > *tàhí-; b) *ebí > *bí-, *mét ̔i(-rkV) > *mrtkn, *nébì > *n-, *pk ̔i > *phək, *p ̔éŋi > *pəŋ-, *ǯeč ̔i > *čjči, *éli > *ər-; c) *č ̔éč ̔í > *čìčr-, *kŋi > *kíń-, *neji > *ní, *sni > *sín, *seri > *sìr’i, *zep ̔i > *sìp-; d) *bèli > *prí-, *peč ̔i > *ps-krì-, *télki > *trkur.
PTM *e - PJ *u
Here it is natural to reconstruct *CeCu, with the following correspondences in other languages. 1. as in *CeCa, Turkic can have both *a and *e:
a) *ènŋu > *ạnkaj, *keju > *Kạjɨn-, *keru > *KArɨĺ-, *kru > *Kạrɨ, *kḗrdu > *Krt-, *lélugV > *jaglɨk, *meju > *bań-, *ńéč ̔u > *jačan-, *ŋḕlu > *jAl-, *ŋḗnu > *jānu-, *p ̔eńu > *Ań, *sèk ̔u > *sạk(ɨ)-, *sḕgù > *sạg, *šèru > *sar-, *t ̔elbu > *tAlagu, *sèp ̔ù > *sạp b) *bdù > *bEdü-k, *bek ̔ú > *bEkre, *č ̔eč ̔u > *čeček, *eŕmu > *eŕen, *kḕju > *Kej-, *kēpu > *gēb-, *k ̔èpù > *Kẹbi-ĺč-, *mĕlu > *bẹleĺ, *nŋu > *jeŋe (but also *jaŋa in Yak. saŋas), *psu > *bes, *šrčú > *serče, *téŋgu > *deŋgil, *tḕtu > *Tetig, *t ̔ḗlù > *tēl, *t ̔ḕŕù > *tEŕek, *zejĺu > *jElme-, *ĕĺǯu > *Eĺčgek.
We can notice the following here: *e is almost always open (except in *Kẹbiĺč and *bẹleĺ), but *a is for the most part closed *ạ (*ạnkaj, *Kạjɨn-, *Kạrɨ, *Krt-, *sạk-, *sạg, *sạp). All the cases with open *a contain a palatal (*jaglɨk, *bań-, *jačan, *jānu-; *sar- < *šèru). Thus, the distribution between *a and *ạ in the type *CeCu is similar to the distribution of *a and *o in the type *CaCo, see above. 2. Mongolian reflexes are rather complicated in this type of correspondence. We can have
a) *a: *rù > *ar(a)-su; *keju > *kajira-; *kru > *kari-; *kḗrdu > *kaǯir; *lépù > *lab-ku (but also *lob-ku); *meju > *maji-; *nŋu > *nagaču; *ŋḗnu > *naŋ-si-; *sedurk ̔V > *sadurkaj; *sek ̔u > *saki-; *seru(k ̔V) > *sarku; *sḕgù > *saji(n); *šèru > *sara-; *tēru > *dar-ta-; *t ̔ḕmu > *tamara-.



CHAPTER TWO 103
After or before a labial there usually appears a labialized reflex *o or *u (although some cases of *a are also attested, cf. *maji- and *tamaraabove, as well as a variant reflexation *labku and lobku):
b) *o/*u: *bēǯu- > *buǯa-; *k ̔èpù > *kubil-; *mĕlu > *mojil-; *psu > *(h)osu-; *p ̔eńu > *(h)ojimu; *segu > *sowsar; *t ̔elbu > *tolbu.
A labialized reflex also appears in *una-gan < *ènŋù and *nolga < *lélugV, despite the absence of labials. Here we are probably dealing with an early vowel metathesis or assimilation *una-gan < *anu-gan and *nol(u)ga < *nal(u)ga.
Besides the back reflexes we also observe front *e and *i:
c) *e: *bdù > *bedi-ɣün, *bek ̔ú > *bekir, *déru > *derbe-, *eŕmu > *ermen, *keru > *kereldüg, *kḕńu > *kene-ge- (but also *kinu-); *kēpu > *kebi-; *k ̔ĺú > *kerelǯegene, *méŋu > *men-dü, *méru- > *merije- (but also *marija-), *t ̔édù > *teǯije-, *t ̔ḗlù > *tele-, *zejĺu > *seleme, *ĕĺǯu > *elǯigen; d) *i: *č ̔ḗp ̔u > *čijigan, *mék ̔ù > *mikan, *nèku > *nigu, *tḕtu > *čida, *sèp ̔ù > *sibsirga;
The distribution of *e and *i here is standard (*e before -i-, -e-, -ü-, *i before -a-, -u-). We may notice that here, too, as in the case of *CeCa, Mongolian and Turkic largely coincide in the distribution of back and front variants Mong. back : Turkic back in 13 cases; Mong. back : Turkic front in 8 cases (interestingly enough, most of them close to labials, i.e. with the Mong. reflex o/u); Mong. front : Turkic front in 9 cases; Mong. front : Turkic back only in 3 cases. It is also interesting to notice the different behaviour of *CeCa and *CeCu both in Turkic and Mongolian: a) *CeCa yields PT *a (almost never closed *ạ) and PM *a without any labialized variants in the vicinity of labials; b) *CeCu yields PT *ạ (with a variant *a only in the vicinity of palatals) and PM *a, with a variant *o/*u close to labials. This all seems to indicate that the development *CeCa > *CaCa, but *CeCu > *CạCu was a common Turko-Mongolian feature, with the vowel *ạ preserved in Turkic (and ultimately reflected as Yak., Chuv. -ɨ- vs. -a- in other Turkic languages), and having developed into *o(*u) in Proto- Mongolian before or after labials (while plain *a stayed unchanged). 3. Korean can have here both standard reflexes *a/*ə and labialized *o/*u:
a) *keru > *kar-; *késu > *kàs (but also *ks); *k ̔èpù > *káps, *sèk ̔u > *sàkí-, *sḕgù > *sà’ó-náb-, *šèru > *sár; b) *seru(k ̔V) > *srk, *t ̔elbu > *trb-, *t ̔ḕŕù > *tr-; c) *bek ̔ú > *pok, *eŕmu > *òrmí, *keju > *kò’, *lélugV > *nòríkái, *ŋḕlu > *nōr-ra-, *téŋgu > *thòŋ, *zejĺu > *sói;



104 INTRODUCTION
d) *č ̔ḗp ̔u > *čjūpók, *meju > *mūi-, *nŋu > *nù’i, *t ̔ékù > *tùthb-.
Occasionally, we also encounter a reflex *ɨ close to labials: *bdù- > *pr-, *lépù > *nɨp(h).
Just as in the case with PA *a (*CaCo) there is also a fifth type of correspondence. In a number of cases when TM has *e and Jpn. either *ə or *a (i.e. where we would reconstruct PA *CeCe or *CeCa), all other languages have quite different reflexes: Korean has *ă or *o/u (typical for PA *o, see below, and for PA *CaCo, see above); and Turkic has predominantly closed *ạ or *ẹ. It seems probable that we are dealing here with the PA root structure *CeCo. Let us mention at once that distribution between Jpn. *a and *ə is still unclear in this type of correspondence, but it seems hardly possible to reconstruct any additional distinctions here: the opposition *a : *ə does not seem to correlate with anything else outside Japanese. It is possible that we are dealing with early vowel assimilations which result in part of the *CeCo words being assimilated to *CeCe, and another part to *CaCo.
Let us sum up the evidence for *CeCo in other languages. 1. Turkic, as in most heterovocalic stems, can have both back and front reflexes:
a) *p ̔o > *Ap (but also *Ep), *ro > *ạrɨ, *ēč ̔o > *č, *ḗpo > *Āb, *gébó > *Kạb-, *kèĺčo > *Kạĺ(č)ɨ-, *kèĺǯo > *KAĺga, *k ̔ĕdò > *KAd, *k ̔eńo > *Kạń, *k ̔ńó > *Kạń-, *k ̔ep ̔orV > *KApur-, *k ̔ŕo > *Kaŕgan-, *k ̔ét ̔ò > *Kạt, *k ̔ēro > *Kạrga-, *néro > *jArman-, *zelo > *jạlɨŋ, *sero > *sạr-, *šéčo > *sạč-, *tmo > *dam, *t ̔èmo > *Tạm-, *t ̔eŕo > *dAŕ, *ǯĕĺo > *jạĺɨ-, *ǯebò > *jAbaĺ. b) *béjo > *bEje, *depo > *jẹbi-, *ep ̔ò > *Epej, *eso > *ẹsür-, *ḗgó > *g-id-, *ḗĺpo > *ēĺü-, *gĕbo > *geb-, *gḗmo > *gmi, *kèro > *gErü, *kéro > *gErüĺ-, *lēmo > *jmiĺč, *melo > *bẹl, *mét ̔ò > *bẹtü(g), *pḗk ̔ò > *bken-, *p ̔ĺo > *ẹĺ-, *p ̔ro > *er-, *tēlo > *dl(b)ü-, *t ̔erk ̔o > *TẹrKe-, *zego > *jEgit.
In the majority of cases when there is a Chuvash or Yakut reflex available, they point here to closed *ạ and *ẹ. Exceptions are *dakɨ (Yak. taɣanɨ), *Kaŕgan- (Yak. xahān-), *dam (Chuv. tom-la-, Yak. tamma- - but notice also the PT variant *dɨm), *dart- (Chuv. tort-); *geb- (Chuv. kavža-, but also kъnbъnš < *gẹb-ĺ-); *er- (Yak. erke, but Chuv. jərgəń, probably < *ẹrk-); *ḗĺü- (Chuv. alъk). Reflexes of open *a or *e in these few cases are probably due to later vocalic assimilations or dialectal mixture. 2. Mongolian, too, has both back and front reflexes:
a) *a: *béjo > *bajita-sun, *bló > *balai, *ep ̔ò > *aɣag, *p ̔o > *(h)aba-, *ro > *ariɣ-, *ḗgó > *aɣu-, *ḗpo > *aba, *gébó > *gawr-su, *kèro > *kari-, *kèĺčo > *kalča-, *kèĺǯo > *kalǯa-, *k ̔eńo > *kajaɣa, *k ̔éńo > *kaji-, *k ̔p ̔ó > *kajila-,



CHAPTER TWO 105
*k ̔ep ̔orV > *kabir-, *k ̔ét ̔ò > *kata-, *k ̔ēro > *kara/ija-, *lēmo > *lamaɣa, *néro > *narba-, *pḗk ̔ò > *baka-, *sero > *sariwu, *šéčo > *saču-, *t ̔erk ̔o > *tariki, *t ̔eŕo > *tar-, *t ̔rbò > *tarbagaj, *t ̔ḕjbo > *tabi-, *t ̔ébo > *tab, *zego > *saɣaka-, *ǯĕĺo > *ǯalka-, *sèp ̔ó > *saba; in *ḗĺpo > *(h)olbug Mongolian has a secondary labialization ( < *(h)albug).
b) *e / i: *depo > *debte-, *emo > *emü-, *eso > *es-, *kéro > *kere-, *két ̔ò > *ketü, *k ̔ŕo > *kerig, *mét ̔ò > *med, *p ̔ḕjló > *helige, *pego > *heɣü, *sèĺbò > *selbi-ɣür; *zelo > *sildaŋ,*šero > *sira-.
The distribution of *e and *i here is standard (-e- before e, ü, i; -i- before a). But additionally Mongolian has quite a number of labialized reflexes *ö/ü, probably developed secondarily from *e/i through regressive labialization and thus also pointing to the labialized nature of the second vowel: *ḗbǯo > *üǯe-, *gĕbo > *güji-, *gèmo > *gömür-, *k ̔ĕdò > *küdeŋ, *k ̔ńó > *köŋgen, *mèto > *möči-, *mḕnò > *mön, *pḕǯo > *böǯi-, *p ̔ĺo > *hülde-, *zelo > *sülde, *ǯebò > *ǯöɣelen.
In this case, as with *CaCe (and unlike *CeCa, *CeCu) it is difficult to find a direct correlation between front/back reflexes in Mongolian and Turkic. The developments *CeCo > *CạC-/*CẹC- in Turkic and > *CaC-/*CeC-/*CöC- in Mongolian thus must have been independent processes, already after the disintegration of Proto-Turko-Mongolian. It can also be seen that the vowel *ạ in PT here differs from the vowel *ạ in the type *CeCu (see above): while the latter reflects a common Turko-Mongolian development *CeCu > *CạCu (with *ạ yielding specific a/o reflexes in Mongolian), the former is a purely Turkic development (no o/u-reflexes are attested in Mongolian in the type *CeCo). 3. Korean, as said above, demonstrates here reflexes typical for PA *o, namely *ă or *o/*u:
a) *bló > *pằrk-, *gèmo > *kăm-, *kèĺčo > *kắr-, *két ̔ò > *kằtằk-, *k ̔eńo > *kń, *k ̔ńó > *kắnắr-, *k ̔éńo > *kằńắi, *lēmo > *nằmằrh, *mko > *mắi-, *mét ̔ò > *mằt, *néro > *nằr-, *p ̔ḕjló > *pắi, *p ̔ĺo > *prb-, *p ̔ro > *pắrá-, *šéčo > *čằčhắi-, *tmo > *tằm-, *t ̔eŕo > *tắrk, *t ̔ḕjbo > *tằbi-, *zelo > *sằr-, *šero > *sằrm-.
Here we should also attribute the cases *ēč ̔o > *č- / *ač- and *ep ̔ò > **ap, reduplicated *páp: because in Kor. *ă could not stand in word-initial position, it was probably early replaced by *a- / *ə-.
b) *p ̔o > *opɨ(s), *gébó > *kò’i, *gḗmo > *kòmắr, *kèĺǯo > *kór(čhí), *lép ̔ó > *nòph-, *mḕnò > *móm, *nko > *nóh-, *t ̔èŋo > *toŋ’ăi, *t ̔ébo > *tōb-, *sèp ̔ó > *sōp c) *kéro > *kūr-, *k ̔ep ̔orV > *kùprŋ, *k ̔ét ̔ò > *kùt-, *mèto > *mūd-, *sèĺbò > *súr, *zego > *sú(h).



106 INTRODUCTION
2.4.3. PA *i
PTM *i - PJ *a
This type reflects the PA structure *CiCa. Other languages display the following reflexes: 1. Turkic can have either back *ɨ or front *i:
a) *č ̔p ̔a > *čp, *iĺa > *ɨĺɨ-, *na > *ɨŋɨr, *īĺa > *ĺ(č), *kba > *Kɨbak, *kìjá > *Kɨj(g)ak, *kŕa > *Kɨŕ-, *k ̔íla > *Kɨl(k), *k ̔rka > *Kɨrk-, *lgà > *jg-, *nra > *jɨr, *p ̔ìrá > *ɨra-, *sgà > *sɨgra, *siŋra > *sɨŋɨr, *sípa > *sɨba-, *símta > *sɨmtab) *ìla > *iler-, *na > *ini, *k ̔ìĺa > *Kiĺe-, *nìt ̔á > *jit-, *nìt ̔à > *jiti, *píńŕa > *bińŕ, *sìlá > *sil, *sīĺa > *sīĺ (but also *sĺ), *sla > *sīl- (but also *sla-), *t ̔má > *Tiŋ(mi), *t ̔ìnt ̔a > *tint
2. Mongolian normally has *i, but a variation i/e before the following -e-, cf. *dísa > *ǯise-, *ìla > *ile, *t ̔á > *itege-, *t ̔má > *čimeɣe, but *k ̔ìĺa > *kelbe-, *kelke-, *nìt ̔á > *nete-).
3. Korean has a usual variation of *a and *ə:
a) *č ̔k ̔à > *čjakai, *na > *àńằ, *k ̔íla > *kār(h), *k ̔ìĺa > *kár, *nìt ̔à > *nát, *píńŕa > *pànắr, *pmà > *pām, *sīĺa > *sár, *t ̔má > *tamɨrb) *na > *ńrɨm, *nìt ̔á > *njth-, *sìča > *čs, *sila > *srí, *sla > *sr-, *ǯima > *čjmr
Note that in some cases, despite the breaking of *i ( > a/ə), a trace of it is left as -j- (čjakai, njəth-, čjəmɨr- etc.).
PTM *i - Jpn. *i
Here it would be natural to reconstruct PA *CiCi, but Turkic parallels show that we are in fact dealing with two types of structures: a) PTM *i - Jpn. *i - Turk. *i < PA *CiCi b) PTM *i - Jpn. *i - Turk. *e < PA *CiCe. Although PA *-e turns most initial vowels into PJ *ə, it evidently behaved differently with PA *-i-, which was not assimilated (a special development is also attested for PA *-u- before *-e, see below). We shall start with the type *CiCe. 1. Turkic. As we said above, the normal reflex here is *e, cf. *č ̔ibe > *čebir-, *ìbè > *eb, *ìbè > *ebin, *ìmé > *em-, *k ̔è > *ēke-, *nīme > *jem-kek, *p ̔ĭjk ̔e > *ejekü, *sík ̔e > *sekü, *t ̔ĭbŋe > *debe, *t ̔ŕge > *tēŕ-, *zìŋke > *jeŋgül.
Closed *e normally appears before *r, *l (cf. a similar distribution in types *CeCe, *CeCi) although in a few cases open *e occurs in this position as well, cf. *č ̔ĭre > *čẹr, *dile > *jẹlin, *ile > *ẹl-t-, but *k ̔ile > *kel-, *tire



CHAPTER TWO 107
> *deriŋ. Closed *ẹ is also observed (for unknown reasons) in *diŋe > *jẹŋ-, *p ̔k ̔è > *ke-.
2. Mongolian, like Turkic, has for the most part *e here, but can also retain *i:
a) *bre > *ber-, *č ̔ĭre > *čer, *dile > *deleŋ, *dible > *dewel, *diŋe > *dejil-, *gibe > *gewü-n, *gire > *gere, *ìbè > *eɣüde, *ipe > *ebül, *k ̔è > *(h)egde-, *nìk ̔é > *negsi, *ple > *heliɣe, *píńŋe > *beɣer, *sík ̔e > *seg, *t ̔ĭbŋe > *teme-ɣen, *t ̔ŕge > *terge-. b) *č ̔me > *čimöge, *če > *iču-, *ile > *ileɣe-, *ìmé > *(h)ima-gta, *re > *ire-, *k ̔ile > *kilim, *k ̔régV > *kiröɣe, *spe > *siber, *zìŋke > *siŋgen-.
The distribution here is more or less usual for *e/i: *-i- before *a, *u and *ö; *-e- before *e, *i and *ü. Just as in the type *CeCi, however, there is a number of exceptional *-i- reflexes before the following -e-, -i(ileɣe-, ire-, siber-, siŋgen, kilim).
3. Korean, as in most rows of correspondences, can have a front reflex (*i) or a back reflex (*ɨ):

PTM *i - PJ *i - PT *i (reflecting PA *CiCi)
In this type, Mongolian normally also has *i, but a variation *i/*e before the following -e- (i. e. behaves exactly like with the type *CiCa, see above), cf. *ìtí > *(h)ideɣür, *īĺbi > *(h)ilbeɣe-sün, *šmi > *sime, *šk ̔i > *siɣe-, *tk ̔i > *čike, but *bĭli > *beɣelej, *p ̔ĭč ̔i > *(h)ečüg-le (?*(h)ečeg-le-), *p ̔ísi(KV) > *heske-.
Korean has predominantly *i (*bilč ̔i > *pìč-, *ĺi > *īr, *pĺǯi > *pìrí-, *sidí > *sīd-, *síŋri > *sì’úr, *sít ̔ì > *sìtrp-, *t ̔ri > *tìr-, *ǯbì > *čìp), but also -ɨ- in *šmi > *smi- - i.e. the same reflexes as in the type *CiCe.
PTM *i - PJ *u
This correspondence presupposes PA *CiCu. In the words of this type other languages have the following reflexes: 1. Turkic may have back *ɨ or front *i:
a) *č ̔iju > *čɨjɨk, *č ̔mu > *čɨm-, *č ̔mu > *čɨm-, *íru > *ɨr, *ìsú > *ɨsɨr-, *ŕu > *ŕ (but also *īŕ), *rú > *ɨrɨm, *k ̔jĺu > *Kɨjĺ-, *nk ̔ú > *jɨk-, *p ̔mù > *ɨm, *p ̔ĭru > *ɨr-, *sgú > *sɨg-, *sk ̔ù > *sɨk-, *sìk ̔u > *sɨk, *sìŋù > *sɨŋok (but also *siŋök), *siju > *sɨ-rga, *šimuč ̔V > *čɨmɨč-, *t ̔[k ̔]ù > *tɨkɨ

2. Mongolian normally has *i, but occasionally *e in front of the following -e- (as in the type *CiCa), cf. *kít ̔u > *kičiɣe-, *slgù > *silgeɣe-, *sísu > *sisegej, but *č ̔ĺč ̔u > *čelčeji- (but also *čili- and, quite exceptionally, *čulčaji-), *ìt ̔ù > *ete-, *kìkú > *kegǯe-, *k ̔jĺu > *kelbe- (but also *kilu-). 3. Korean, as usual, can have both front (*i) and back (*ɨ) variants:
a) *č ̔iju > *čī-n, *ŕu > *ìráŋ, *kít ̔u > *kìtr’ó-, *k ̔írù > *kìrmá, *nk ̔ú > *nìkì-, *p ̔ĭru > *pīr-, *slgù- > *sir-, *t ̔[k ̔]ù > *tìk-, *č ̔íp ̔ú > *čìp-.
b) *č ̔mu > *čúmkúi (probably assimilation < čmkúi), *íru > *rp-, *ìsú > *ɨsɨr-, *ru > *ɨrɨ-, *sìŋù > *sin, *sísu > *ss-.
In a number of cases we observe the correspondence PTM *i : PJ *ə. Turkic almost exclusively has a reflex *ɨ here, thus pointing to an original back second vowel, while Korean has variation between *ɨ and *o/*u, and Mongolian has a uniform *i. It is natural to reconstruct here PA *CiCo, cf.:

Cf. also *nbŕo > PM *niɣur, PT *jǖŕ (instead of *jbŕ with contraction), PJ *nər-. More frequently, however, Japanese appears to have a reflex *i in the same row of correspondences, cf.:

It appears, therefore, that in Japanese, *i was more “resistant” to the influence of second vowels than other vowels of the first syllable: it tends to stay unchanged before the following *o and does not change to *ə before the following *e (see above). It did, however, assimilate to the following *a and *u (see above), yielding *a and *u respectively.
2.4.4. PA *o
Preliminary note. The vowels *o and *u are generally hard to distinguish in Altaic because there is constant variation — probably dialectal in origin — between o and u in Tungus-Manchu, Mongolian and Korean. There are, however, some general guidelines which still allow us to make this distinction in PA: a) Korean *ă seems to correspond exclusively to PT *o or *ö, not to PT *u or *ü. b) Korean *ɨ, on the other hand, is predominantly found corresponding to Turkic *u or *ü, not to *o or *ö (although there are some exceptions, see below). Thus it seems reasonable to base the distinction between *o and *u on Turkic and Korean indications, ignoring the constant o/u variation in TM and Mongolian.



110 INTRODUCTION
PTM *o/*u - PJ *a
This correlation points to the PA type *CoCa in most cases when Turkic has *o and Korean has *ă. TM and Mongolian here have a variation of *o and *u, cf.: 1. TM:
a) *k ̔à > *ok-, *bkà > *boka-, *bóra > *borī-, *č ̔ṑk ̔a > *čōk(i)-,*kòŋa > *koŋna-, *kōŋa > *kōŋā-, *k ̔òbàni > *xobanī, *ŋṑla > *ŋōli-, *ŋṑŕa > *ŋōr-ča-, *òǯa > *(x)oǯu, *pga > *poga-, *tok ̔à > *dokta-, *p ̔ṑńŋa > *pōnŋa-. b) *kòna(-kV) > *kuŋge, *kṓk ̔à > *kuKe-, *k ̔ĺba > *xulbü-, *op ̔á(rV) > *(x)upara-, *ōt ̔a > *(x)utinŋe, *sṓra > *sure, *t ̔otá > *tut[a]-, *č ̔ṓga > *čuguk.

PTM *o/*u - PJ *ə
This correlation points to the PA type *CoCe when there is an indication of a front second vowel: front *ö or *ü in Mongolian, front *ö in Turkic or *ɨ in Korean (by the way, this is the only case when Kor. *ɨ can reflect PA *o; in all other cases *ɨ is indicative of PA *u, see above). On PTM *o/u : PJ *ə reflecting PA *CoCo see below. Let us look at the reflexes in more detail: 1. TM, as always, has variation between *o and *u here (although *u is more frequent):
a) *bke > *bokan-, *bt ̔é > *botā-, *dṓne(k ̔V) > *doŋka, *kŏŋe > *koŋ-, *kŏše > *koša, *kòt ̔e > *kota-, *ŋke > *oŋka, *t ̔è > *(x)ot-, *ṓk ̔è > *oK-, *pk ̔è > *poK-, *p ̔ṓre > *pora-n, *t ̔òŋke > *toŋal-, *bojĺe > *bol-, *t ̔ome > *tom-ka-n. b) *bdé > *buduri-, *čŏĺe > *ǯule, *č ̔óme > *čuŋnu, *gre > *gur-, *gṑje > *gū, *ṓč ̔é > *(x)uč-, *kóčè > *kuči-, *kk ̔è > *xuku-n, *klé > *kul-, *kŏp ̔é > *kupe-, *kóre > *kuri-, *kòrke > *kurke, *k ̔òlke > *xulki-, *móĺe > *mul-, *mòle > *mul-, *nóle > *nul-, *òje > *ujV-, *je > *uju-, *òk ̔è > *(x)uk-t-, *se > *us(a), *ò[k ̔]è > *uKu-, *ṓt ̔è > *(x)ut-, *p ̔olńe > *pulńe-, *p ̔ome > *pum-te, *p ̔re > *puri-, *p ̔t ̔è > *put-, *p ̔ṓle > *pul-, *p ̔ṓt ̔è > *putē, *soge > *sug-, *soke > *suku-, *t ̔kè > *tuKa-la, *t ̔oŋerV > *tuŋde, *t ̔ŕe > *turgun, *t ̔ṓŕe > *turV, *ǯṓk ̔e > *ǯuke, *ǯṓǯe > *ǯuǯa-, *boĺe > *bulu-, *dōre > *dūr-, *póńe > *puń

2. Turkic also has both a back reflex *o and a front reflex *ö:
a) *dṓne-k ̔V > *jōnak, *gòdè > *Kodur-, *òŋè > *oŋ (but also *öŋ), *kólè > *Kolu, *kŏŋe > *Koŋur-, *óče > *očɨg, *se > *osa-, *p ̔olńe > *oń, *soge > *soglɨ-, *šop ̔é > *čopur, *t ̔oŋerV > *To(ŋ)gurak, *t ̔ṓŕe > *tōŕ, *ǯṓk ̔e > *jōk, *ǯṓǯe > *jōj, *dōre > *jorɨ-, *bojĺe > *boĺ, *t ̔ome > *Tomar.

After labials, sometimes a narrowed reflex *ü is found as well: *bdé > *büdi-, *mòle > *bül-, *pk ̔è > *bügde, *p ̔t ̔è > *üt-, *p ̔ṓt ̔è > *ǖt.
3. Mongolian can have any labialized vowel, although *u occurs relatively rarely.
a) *bògé > *bogda, *gre > *gori, *k ̔òké > *kog-si-, *kòrke > *korgu, *kŏše > *kosiɣu, *kòt ̔e > *kota-gar, *òje > *oji-mu- (but also *üji-), *ò[k ̔]è > *oki-n (but also *öki-n), *pk ̔è > *hoktal-, *p ̔ṓre > *horaj, *šop ̔é > *čob, *t ̔oŋerV > *towrai, *t ̔ṓŕe > *tortag b) *gṑje > *gujir-, *klé > *kul-či-, *òk ̔è > *(h)uki-la-, *p ̔t ̔è > *hutuɣa, *ǯṓk ̔e > *ǯug (but also *ǯüg), *póńe > *hunic) *oŋne > *önü-, *čŏĺe > *döli, *č ̔óme > *čöm, *dṓne-k ̔V > *döŋ(ge), *òŋè > *öŋge, *ōč ̔é > *öče-, *kóčè > *köske, *kk ̔è > *kökön, *kŏp ̔é > *köb- (but also *küb-), *kóre > *kör, *k ̔òlke > *kölge, *móĺe > *mölǯi-, *nóle > *nöl-, *oče > *öčüge, *ŋke > *öŋ, *se > *ös, *t ̔è > *öči-, *ṓk ̔è > *ög-, *ṓre > *ör-, *ṓt ̔è > *öte-, *p ̔gè > *(h)öɣeg-si-, *p ̔re > *(h)örde-, *soke > *sögüd- (but also *sog-suji-), *t ̔kè > *tögüčeg, *t ̔ŕe > *töre, *kóbe > *köbsi
d) *bdé > *büdüri-, *bke > *büg- (but also *bög-), *boĺe > *büli (but also *böle), *bt ̔é > *büči, *gòdè > *güǯi-, *kólè > *küli-, *ge > *ügej, *je > *üje, *p ̔olńe > *hüne-sü, *p ̔ome > *(h)ün-Külčig, *p ̔ṓt ̔è > *hütü-, *soge- > *süji-, *ǯṓǯe > *ǯüǯig, *dōre > *dürbe-, *tole > *döli-gen.
It seems that no direct correlation can be established between back and front row reflexes in Turkic and Mongolian. In both subgroups the front reflexes (*ö in Turkic, *ö/*ü in Mongolian) are the most abundant, which explains a relatively high proportion of Turk. *ö : Mong. *ö/*ü (23 cases against just 2 cases of Turk. *o : Mong. *o); but there are also 10 cases of Turk. *o : Mong. *ö/*ü and 11 cases of Turk. *ö : Mong. *o/u which shows clearly that the distribution is random and the process of



112 INTRODUCTION
fronting *CoCe > *CöC- must have operated independently in Turkic and Mongolian. 4. Korean, as said above, in the majority of cases has the reflex *ɨ here (otherwise typical for PA *u, see below); but it can also have labialized *o and *u reflexes:
a) *bt ̔é > *pth-, *čŏĺe > *čɨrə, *dṓne-k ̔V > *tŋ, *gre > *krì-, *gṑje > *ki-, *k ̔òké > *kɨh-, *kŏŋe > *kń-, *kŏše > *kìsrk (a metathesis < *ksírk), *móĺe > *mr-, *mòle > *mɨră-, *p ̔ome > *phɨm ( ~ *phum), *p ̔re > *pr, *p ̔t ̔è > *pth-, *p ̔ṓle > *prh-, *t ̔ṓŕe > *tr, *ǯṓǯe > *ččh-, *bojĺe > *pi-, *póńe > *pńk. b) *kk ̔è > *kokăi-, *kŏp ̔é > *kòp- (but also *kùp-), *ge > *ói-rằb-, *ṓre > *ōr, *p ̔ṓt ̔è > *pot, *t ̔òŋke > *tonkor-, *t ̔ome > *tòmá. c) *kòrke > *kúkì, *kòt ̔e > *kút, *nóle > *nuri-, *ṓk ̔è > *ukɨr, *soge > *sūi-.
PTM *o/u - PJ *u
This correlation may point to *CoCu (see below), but there is also a rather large number of cases when Turkic and/or Mongolian have a fronted reflex *ö here, pointing to a front second vowel. In such cases it is natural to reconstruct PA *CoCi, assuming that the vowel *o in Japanese did not get assimilated to the following *i, but stayed labialized (just like the vowel *u, see below). The individual subgroups behave here as follows: 1. TM, as usual, has variation between *o and *u:
a) *bŏĺi > *bolgikta, *č ̔ŏk ̔i > *čoK[i]-, *gòlí > *goli, *goli > *gola, *k ̔ŏjli > *xolda-n (but also *xul-ŋsi), *mṓli > *mol-, *oki- > *ok-, *t ̔ògì > *togar b) *gók ̔ì > *gugda, *kóšì > *kuši-pun, *kómp ̔i > *kumpe(ke), *kŏt ̔i > *kutu-, *k ̔mi > *xumu-, *k ̔óp ̔ì > *xup-, *k ̔ōkí > *kūkta, *k ̔ṓli > *xule-, *mók ̔ì > *muxu-, *òŋi(čV) > *uŋ-se, *p ̔ìkV > *upVkte, *ti > *(x)utur-, *ṓŕì > *uri, *p ̔gí(-rV) > *pugi-, *pótirkV > *putukā, *sogì > *sugulē-n, *k ̔ori > *xurē, *ŋònŋi > *ŋunŋe, *sṓjk ̔ì > *sujKu-, *k ̔ōńi > *xuńa-.
2. Turkic occasionally has *o (*k ̔ŏjli > *Kol, *oki > *ok-, *k ̔ori > *Korum); but *ö in the vast majority of cases: *bŏĺi > *böĺ, *bṓrk ̔i > *bȫrk, *č ̔ŏk ̔i > *čök-, *goli > *Köl-, *kóšì > *köse-, *kómp ̔i > *gömül-dürük, *kŏt ̔i > *göt-, *k ̔mi > *göm-, *k ̔óp ̔ì > *köp, *k ̔ōkí > *kök, *k ̔ṓli > *kȫl, *mók ̔ì > *böktel ( ~-ü-), *mṓli > *bȫl-, *òŋi(čV) > *öŋüč, *p ̔ìkV > *öpke, *ti > *öt-, *ṓni > *ȫn-, *ṓŕì > *ȫŕ, *ṓŕi > *ȫŕ (/*ǖŕ), *pgí(-rV) > *bögür, *sogì > *sögül-, *ŋònŋi > *öŋ-ed-, *sṓjk ̔i > *sȫk-, *k ̔ōńi > *kȫjnek.
3. Mongolian, likewise, has both back and front reflexes, and the back ones are also rather rare (only *ti > *oči-, *bŏĺi > *bujil- (but also *büjil-), *sogì > *suɣumaji, *k ̔ōńi > *kunija). In the vast majority of cases Mongolian has *ö, somewhat less frequently - *ü:



CHAPTER TWO 113
a) *č ̔ŏk ̔i > *čökü-, *gók ̔ì > *gögde-, *gòlí > *gölmi, *goli > *göle-, *kóšì > *kösi-, *kómp ̔i > *kömürge, *kŏt ̔i > *kötü-, *k ̔ŏjli > *köl, *k ̔óp ̔ì > *köb-čin, *k ̔ōkí > *kögene, *mók ̔ì > *mökü-, *mṓli > *möli-, *òŋi(čV) > *öŋgül-, *p ̔ìkV > *(h)öɣe, *ṓni > *öndü, *ṓŕì > *örü, *ṓŕi > *örgü- (*ergü-), *pgí(-rV) > *böɣere, *t ̔ògì > *töɣe, *sṓjk ̔ì > *sögeɣeb) *bṓrk ̔i > *bürkü-, *k ̔ṓli > *küjil-, *oki > *üge, *pótirkV > *büdürkei, *p ̔ōki > *(hü)gün; *k ̔ori > *kür, *ŋònŋi > *üne
It is interesting to observe that *CoCi generally behaves in Turko-Mongolian somewhat differently than *CoCe: back reflexes in the former type are much less frequent. It is reasonable to suppose that the fronting *CoCi > *CöCi already occurred in common Turko-Mongolian, while the process *CoCe > *CöC- operated (as we mentioned above) already after the split of the protolanguage and did not occur in some dialects. 4. Korean here has the standard labialized reflexes *o or *u; there are no cases of *ɨ, and two cases of *ă (*k ̔ṓli > *kằrắm and *mṓli > *mằrằ-) can be easily explained by secondary vowel assimilation.
a) *gók ̔ì > *kòkái, *k ̔óp ̔ì > *kòp-, *oki > *o’ăi-, *ṓŕi > *òrắ-, *k ̔ori > *kòráŋ. b) *č ̔ŏk ̔i > *čùk-, *k ̔ŏjli > *kūi-, *mók ̔ì > *muk-, *ṓni > *un-tu, *pgí(-rV) > *pùr (with a secondary dissimilative or contractive variant *pr), *k ̔ōńi > *kùńí.
As we said above, the correspondence PTM *o/u : PJ *u can also reflect PA *CoCu. In this case both Turkic and Mongolian uniformly have back vowels (Turkic *o, Mong. *o/u), while Korean reveals the reflex *ă (typical also for *CoCa and *CoCo), as well as the standard back vowels *o/u.
1. In TM we observe, as usual, both *o and *u:
a) *dòru > *dora(n), *goblu > *gola, *kobu > *kobi, *koru > *koru, *olu > *ola-, *óŋdu > *oŋda, *óru > *or-, *ṑlu > *ō-, *p ̔mu > *pom-, *sòmú > *soma, *sònŋu > *soŋka, *t ̔ók ̔u > *tokta-, *t ̔ŏk ̔ù > *toxan, *t ̔ṑlu > *tol-, *t ̔mù > *tomka-, *t ̔op ̔u > *top(V)g-, *mu > *omga b) *bŏgdu > *bugdi, *bku > *bukse, *dòru > *duru-, *kru > *kuri, *moju > *muja-, *mólu > *mulu, *ŋṓjču > *ŋujši- ( = *ŋüši-), *rù > *(x)urī-, *pru > *pur-, *póju > *puj(u)-, *p ̔ó[k]u > *puk- (but also *pok-), *sogú > *suge-le-, *snu > *suna, *tṓŕu > *duri, *t ̔bru > *turku-, *t ̔òp ̔ú > *tup-, *t ̔oru > *turi-kta, *t ̔olu > *tule-, *k ̔oru > *xurumü-, *t ̔gsu > *tuksa2. Mongolian also has back *o or *u:
a) *dòru > *doru, *goblu > *gowl, *kbú > *koɣu-su, *koru > *korbu, *k ̔oru > *koru-, *nòču > *noču-, *mu > *(h)omu, *omuŕV > *omur-, *óru > *ori(but also *uri-), *rù > *oro-, *ṑlu > *ol-, *pru > *boruɣa, *p ̔mu >

Korean has *ă, *o or (less frequently) *u:
a) *kru > *kắrái, *moju > *mắin, *mólu > *mằrằ, *ŋṓjču > *nằč-, *p ̔ó[k]ù> *păk- ( ~-a-), *sòmú > *sắmái, *t ̔bru > *tằràčhí, *t ̔ṑlu > *tằikòr, *t ̔oru > *tắrái, *t ̔olu > *tằr(b)-. b) *goblu > *kōr, *kbú > *kō-r-, *koru > *kòrài, *k ̔oru > *kòrh-, *k ̔ṑmu > *kōmá, *mu > *òmìnòi, *óŋdu > *òńắrí, *ṑlu > *ó-, *pru > *pora, *tolu > *tór. c) *póju > *pùthj, *tṓŕu > *turəi.
PTM *o/u - PJ *ə
This type evidently reflects PA *CoCo. TM here has the usual split into *o and *u:
a) *kòmpo > *komba-, *mṓjno > *moŋa-n, *mónŋo > *monŋi-, *mṑro > * *mōr-, *p ̔okt ̔o(rV) > *pokta, *šmo > *šom-, *lok ̔o > *loxa, *ót ̔ó(rV) > *utu-. b) *kk ̔ò > *kuk-pun, *sk ̔o > *suK-, *sṓlo > *sula-, *t ̔ro(-k ̔V) > *turākī. A similar split is, as usual, observed in Mongolian:
a) *bójĺo > *bolgu-ɣa-, *borso-k ̔V > *borki, *kk ̔ò > *kokir, *kòmpo > *kombo-, *p ̔okt ̔o(-rV) > *hogtorgui, *sk ̔o > *sogug, *šmo > *čomub) *mṓjno > *mundaɣa, *mónŋo > *mun-, *sṓlo > *sula-, *t ̔ro(-k ̔V) > *turagu.
Other languages have quite uniform reflexes: *o in Turkic, *ă in Korean.
2.4.5. PA *u
PTM *o/u - PJ *a
The correspondence is quite similar to PTM *o/u : PJ *a < PA *CoCa, see above. However, we reconstruct *CuCa in cases when Turkic has the reflex *u, not *o:

It is important to notice that both Mongolian and Korean seem to have some *-a-reflexes here (which they do not show in the *CoCa type, see above). This allows us to classify several other cases as reflecting PA *CuCa, even though Turkic may have *-o- there (this is usually in the vicinity of labials, where *o and *u are extensively confused in Turkic as well):

In many cases, however, the type *CuCa is very difficult to distinguish from *CoCa, basically because the TM and Jpn. evidence is the same for both types.
PTM *o/u : PJ *ua
This is a very specific type of correspondence and the only one where PJ reveals a diphthong (in numerous other cases the PJ diphthongs *ua, *ia, *ai go back to contractions after the disappearance of some intervocalic consonant). It must be said that Turkic regularly has *ü here, while Mongolian, too, may have *ü or *ö, and Korean *ɨ: this all points to an original front vowel in the second syllable. Therefore we may choose here between reconstructing PA *CuCe or *CuCi. However, *CuCi must be reconstructed for the type PTM *u : PJ *u (with front reflexes in Turkic and Mongolian, see below), since the Japanese reflex there is quite parallel to that of *CoCi (see above). Therefore it is most probable that we are dealing here with a specific Japanese development of *CuCe (probably through *CuəCe). Details of the development of PA *CuCe:
1. TM, as usual, has variation of *o and *u, although *u is encountered more frequently:
a) *dle > *dolba; *kup ̔e > *kopu-, *luke > *loka-, *muŋĺe > *moŋla, *mk ̔é > *mōk-, *puse > *pos-, *p ̔ske > *poske-, *p ̔gé > *pōg-, *ǯjbe > *ǯoba-, *kure > *kora-, *uge > *oksari, *tĺe > *dōlā b) *bté > *butu-; *bŋe > *būni-; *gŭjŕe > *guǯej; *kúbé > *kub-, *kúk ̔è > *kuKu-; *kúmle > *ku(l)maka; *kúńe > *kuńī-kta; *kúŋe > *kuŋ-; *k ̔ude > *xuda, *lŭge > *luksi, *múbè > *mub(up)-, *mùč ̔e > *muči-kta, *múk ̔è > *muK-, *nk ̔é > *nuK-, *nure > *nur-, *ŋje > *ŋūjelse, *ūre > *ūri, *p ̔úńe > *puń-, *pne > *punŋe-, *p ̔uje > *puju-, *p ̔ujme > *pume-, *p ̔úńe > *puńe-, *p ̔ùŋké > *puŋk(u)-, *suk ̔e > *suK-, *súme > *sumu-, *t ̔úbé > *tuba, *t ̔ŭge > *tuge-, *t ̔ule(kV) > *tulge, *ùč ̔e > *uč-, *úk ̔è > *(x)uKu-, *ūĺpe > *ulgu-kī, *uŋt ̔e > *(x)unda-, *uŋe > *uŋ-, *uk ̔è > *(x)uKu-, *t ̔ŋe > *tuŋke, *nŋe > *(x)uŋ(ia)-.
2. Turkic usually has *ü, but occasionally also *ö:



CHAPTER TWO 117
a) *bté > *büt-, *gŭjŕe > *güŕel, *gure > *Kürüĺ, *kúbé > *güb-, *kude > *güde-, *kúmle > *Külmüŕ, *kúńe > *güńe (but also *guńa), *kune > *güni, *k ̔ude > *küdüg, *lŭge > *jügen, *luke > *jükün-, *mùne > *bün, *muŋĺe > *büŋüĺ, *púre > *bür, *pne > *bǖn, *p ̔uje > *üjük, *suk ̔e > *süksük, *súme > *süm-, *t ̔ŭge > *tüge-, *t ̔ŋe > *tüŋ-, *t ̔ule(kV) > *tülki, *ùč ̔e > *üčün, *ĺpe > *ǖĺ, *uŋe > *üŋ-, *nŋe > *ǖn, *kure > *Küre-, *uge > *ügi b) *bŋe > *böŋre-, *kúŋe > *göjŋ-il, *k ̔ùńe > *köń-, *ŋje > *öjek, *ūre > *ör ( ~ *ür), *puse > *bös-, *p ̔uŋké > *öŋ (but also *oŋ), *uk ̔è > *ökte. Back *u is attested only in one case: *ǯjbe > PT *jub-ka. 3. Mongolian can have any labialized vowel, just as in the type *CoCe: a) *bùjre > *buruɣu, *gure > *guril, *kude > *kuda, *k ̔ude > *kuda-ldu, *luke > *nugu-, *múk ̔è > *muku-, *mùne > *mun-du-, *pne > *hunu-, *p ̔uje > *hujil-, *p ̔gé > *(h)ug- (but also *(h)üg-), *suk ̔e > *sukaj, *sume > *sumun, *t ̔ŭge > *tuji-, *ùč ̔e > *učir, *úk ̔è > *(h)ukaɣa, *nŋe > *uŋ-si-, *kure > *kur(u)-, *uge > *uɣuli, *ubre > *(h)uwr, *tĺe > *dul b) *bté > *bodu(ɣa), *tújpè > *dobu (but also *döbe), *gŭjŕe > *goju, *lŭge > *logtu, *púre > *bor-, *p ̔ùŋké > *(h)oŋgu-, *sre > *sori-, *t ̔úbé > *tojigun, *ĺpe > *olbo, *uŋt ̔e > *(h)ona-, *uŋe > *oŋgi, *ǯjbe > *ǯoba-, *t ̔ŋe > *toɣuna, *ūre > *orai c) *bŋe > *büŋsi-, *dle > *düli-, *múbè > *müjide, *p ̔úńe > *hünir, *p ̔úńe > *hü-sü, *uk ̔è > *(h)üki d) *kúbé > *köw- (but also *küw-), *kup ̔e > *köbü-, *mùč ̔e > *möčir, *mk ̔é > *mök-, *nk ̔é > *nögči-, *nure > *nör-, *ńūje > *ǯöɣe-, *ŋje > *öjekeji, *p ̔nte > *hötün, *p ̔ske > *(h)öskil-, *súme > *sömü-sü.
4. Korean can have here *o (pointing to an original labialized vowel), but *a/*ə reflexes are also rather frequent, which links together the Korean and Japanese (see below) reflexes of *CuCe. It is worth noting that *-u- is very rare (but cf. *ǯjbe > *čubɨr-).
a) *bùjre > *ōi-, *gŭjŕe > *kò’í-, *kúk ̔è > *kòkí, *múk ̔è > *moka-, *pne > *pòm-nor-, *ubre > *órh-, *uŋe > *òŋ-táŋ- (but also *ùŋ-tŋ-). b) *kúŋe > *kà’ón-tắi, *kup ̔e > *kàpắi-, *nure > *nàrhó-, *p ̔nte > *pántó, *suk ̔e > *sak-, *súme > *sàm, *t ̔úbé > *tàbàkí, *ùč ̔e > *áčh. c) *kúńe > *kńúi, *p ̔ùŋk ̔é > *pŋkr-, *p ̔gé > *phí-, *uŋt ̔e > *əŋtəŋ’i, *ǯjbe > *jbi-, *múbè > *mbi- (but also *mbi-), *sre > *sr-. 5. Japanese normally has *-ua-, but *-a- after labials:
a) *dle > *duà, *gŭjŕe > *kuà-p-, *gure > *kua, *kúbé > *kuámp-, *kúk ̔è > *kuaku-mi, *kúmle > *kuáma, *kune > *kuanami, *luke > *nuaki ( ~ -ə-), *nk ̔é > *nuànkà-, *nure > *nuarua- ( ~ -ə-), *súme > *sua, *sume > *suama, *sre > *suarasi, *t ̔úbé > *tuámpí ( ~ -ə-), *t ̔ule(kV) > *tuara, *ǯjbe > *duàwà-, *k ̔ùre > *kuà, *t ̔ŋe > *túa;



118 INTRODUCTION
b) *bùjre > *bàr-, *bté > *pàtákài, *bŋe > *bamia-, *múbè > *mápí-rə(n)ka-, *mùč ̔e > *màtú, *múk ̔è > *mák-, *mùne > *màntù-, *muŋĺe > *masu-, *mk ̔é > *mànkúrúa, *p ̔úńe > *páná, *pure > *pá, *puse > *pansa-, *pne > *pana-, *p ̔úńe > *pánái, *p ̔ùŋké > *pànká-, *p ̔ske > *pànsìk-, *p ̔gé > *pànk-.
A special situation ariseis when the first consonant is absent or dropped in PJ. In such a case early PJ must have had a regular reflex *uaC- > OJ uoC-; but since the diphthong -uo- in OJ can only occur after consonants, it is regularly replaced by wo-. In fact we are not able to distinguish PJ *bəC- < PA *bVCV from PJ *uaC- < PA *uCe:
*ŋje > PJ *b ~ *uà (OJ wo), *ūre > PJ *bətə ~ *uatə (OJ woto-), *úk ̔è > PJ *bkà ~ *uákà (OJ woka), *ĺpe > PJ *bəsə ~ *uasua (OJ woso), *ubre > PJ *bətu ~ *uatu (OJ wotu), *uk ̔è > PJ *bəkə ~ *uakə (OJ woko).
Note that in several cases OJ has variation wo- / u- here (woso ~ uso, wotu ~ utu, woko ~ uko).
PTM *u : PJ *u
This correspondence points to PA *CuCi in cases when Turkic and/or Mongolian have front reflexes, indicating a front second vowel. Details of *CuCi reflexation: 1. TM has the usual split into *o and *u, although *u is a more frequent reflex:
a) *gurgi > *gorgakta, *gŭri > *gora, *gùri > *gori-, *kuri > *kori, *k ̔ŭli > *xol-, *p ̔ukǯi > *pogǯV, *sùjli > *sol-gi, *tldi > *dōldī-, *tti > *dodo-ka(n), *t ̔mi > *tōma, *znti > *sōn-dab) *bli > *bul-, *č ̔uli > *čulbi-, *dŭŕi > *dur-, *dli > *dulbu-, *guči > *gusi, *gŕi > *gurē-, *glì > *gūle, *gldi > *gulde-, *kŭŋi > *kuŋā, *kut ̔i > *kuta, *kūči > *kusǖ-, *k ̔ùdì > *xudekī, *k ̔uli > *xulē-, *mújŋi > *muŋi, *mùsi > *musun, *mt ̔ì > *mute-, *p ̔ri > *pur-, *p ̔ūji > *pū-, *p ̔ŭdi > *pude-, *p ̔li > *pule-, *p ̔ĺi > *pule-, *p ̔k ̔ŋi > *puŋku, *sri > *suru-, *tgì > *dug-, *túŋì > *duŋ-, *turi > *duru-n, *t ̔p ̔i > *tupi-, *t ̔ut ̔i > *tute-, *t ̔ĺi > *tulī-, *uĺi > *ulē-, *zŭli > *suli-, *ǯugi > *ǯugū-.
2. Mongolian has either *ü or *ö (but normally no back reflexes):
a) *bli > *büli-, *dli > *dülei, *gurgi > *güreɣe, *gŭri > *gür, *gldi > *güldi-, *kuri > *kürijen, *kūči > *küči-n, *k ̔ŭli > *küjilen, *p ̔ri > *hüre, *p ̔ri > *(h)üre-, *p ̔k ̔ŋi > *hüŋgü-, *tgì > *tügsi-, *tumi > *düŋgür, *turi > *düri, *t ̔ùji > *tüjit-, *uĺi > *(h)ülte-, *č ̔i > *üǯüɣür, *zŭli > *sülbe-,*znti > *sünde-sü, *p ̔ŭdi > *hüdeb) *č ̔uli > *čölü-, *dŭŕi > *dörü, *gŕi > *görü-, *gùri > *gör-, *kŭŋi > *köw, *k ̔ùdì > *ködü-sü, *mújŋi > *möɣer-sü, *mùsi > *mösü(n), *mt ̔i > *möči-, *nuli > *nölüɣe, *p ̔ūji > *(h)öjeɣe, *p ̔ukǯi > *(h)ögǯeg, *p ̔li > *(h)ölmej,

3. Turkic may have a back *u or a front *ü:
a) *bli > *bulga-, *gurgi > *Kurgak, *kuri > *Kur-, *k ̔ŭli > *Kula, *mújŋi > *bujŋuŕ (but also *büjŋüŕ), *mùsi > *bus, *nuli > *julɨ-, *p ̔ri > *urug, *p ̔ūji > *ujɨ-, *p ̔ŭdi > *ud-, *p ̔ri > *ur-, *sùjli > *suli (but also *süli), *t ̔ùji > Tujug, *t ̔ĺi > *dūĺ, *t ̔mi > *tum-gu-, *uĺi > *uĺa-, *č ̔i > *ūč, *znti > *junt b) *č ̔uli > *čülik-, *dŭŕi > *jüŕ-, *dli > *jǖl-, *gŭri > *gür, *gŕi > *güŕ-, *gùri > *Kür, *glì > *gül, *gldi > *gǖl-, *kŭŋi > *güŋ, *kut ̔i > *Küte(re), *kūči > *gǖč, *k ̔ùdì > *küdiŕ > (with assimilation) *kidiŕ, *p ̔ĺi > *üĺ-, *p ̔k ̔ŋi > *ǖk-, *sri > *sǖr-, *mt ̔i > *büt-, *tgì > *düg-, *tumi > *düm-, *túŋì > *düŋür, *turi > *dür, *tĺdi > *düĺ-ün-, *tūri > *dǖr-, *tti > *dǖtük, *t ̔ukì > *tüke-, *t ̔p ̔i > *tübkür-, *t ̔út ̔i > *tüt-, *t ̔ut ̔ì > *Tüt-, *úŕi > *üŕ-, *zŭli > *jül-, *ǯugi > *jü-.
4. Korean may have *o/*u or *ɨ:
a) *dli > *tor (but also *tur-), *kūči > *kóčắk, *mt ̔i > *mòt(á)-, *p ̔ri > *pòrì, *uĺi > *ori-. b) *č ̔uli > *čūr-, *gŭri > *kūrk-, *nuli > *nùr-, .*sùjli > *súi, *t ̔ut ̔i > *tùtrí-, *č ̔i > *učuk. c) *gŕi > *kr-, *gùri > *kr-, *mújŋi > *mi’ìm, *p ̔li > *prhằi, *p ̔ĺi > *phr-, *sri > *sr-,*tĺdi > *td-, *t ̔út ̔i > *tt-, *ǯugi > *čì- (probably < *čɨj- < *čɨg-).
PTM *o/u : PJ *ə
This correlation points to PA *CuCo when Turkic and Mongolian have back vowels (PT *u, PM *u/o); Korean in these cases also has *o/u or *ɨ. 1. TM:

This correlation may point, as we noticed above, to PA *CoCi, *CoCu and *CuCi. However, in cases where PT has a back *u (corresponding to PTM *u/o and PJ *u) it seems possible to reconstruct PA *CuCu. Other languages have the usual labialized reflexes here (*o/u in TM, *o/u in Mongolian, *o/u in Korean): 1. TM:
a) *kušu > *košikta, *múnu > *moŋ-nV-, *sku > *soka-, *ùkú > *oKa-, *úk ̔u > *(x)oksa-, *úmu > *omu- (but also *umu-); b) *gt ̔ù > *gutu-, *kmu > *kum-, *kgù > *kūku, *luŋu > *luŋur, *nŋu > *nuŋari, *ŋju > *ŋu(j)a, *p ̔uču > *pusi(-kV), *tuju > *duja, *tjk ̔ú > *duKū-, *t ̔ŭmu > *tumŋu-, *uĺukV > *ulēk, *zūru > *suru. 2. Mongolian:
a) *nŋu > *nowur-, *ŋju > *nojir, *tjk ̔ú > *doki-, *t ̔ŭmu > *tom-; b) *č ̔ùgù > *čug-, *gt ̔ù > *gutu-, *kmu > *kumi-, *kušu > *kusiga, *múnu > *mun-, *sku > *sugu-, *tuju > *duɣul-, *uju > *uj, *ùkú > *ugtu-, *úk ̔u > *uka-, *uĺukV > *ulig, *úmu > *(h)umaj. 3. Korean
a) *č ̔ùgù > *čòk, *kgù > *kòhài, *sku > *sok-kori; b) *ùkú > *ùhi-, *úmu > *ūm.
In a couple of cases (usually in the vicinity of labials) Kor. has an unexpected reflex -a-/-ə- here, possibly due to dissimilation: *kmu > *kàm-, *p ̔uču > *pčm, *tjk ̔ú > *tjk-.
Since PA *CuCu and *CuCo are kept distinct only in Japanese (and in a few cases where Korean has *CɨC- < *CuCo), it is generally difficult to distinguish those two types of root structure from each other.
2.4.6 Diphthongs
Among subgroups of Altaic, diphthongs are present in Turkic (only *ia), Tungus-Manchu (*ia and *iu; the latter is usually noted as *ü in the reconstruction of Benzing and Tsintsius which we follow, but was probably phonetically rather something like *u), Korean (-ja-, -jə-, -ju-) and Japanese (*ua, *ia, *ai, *ui, *əi). All Japanese diphthongs usually originate from various contractions after the loss of intervocalic consonants (see above); the only exception is *ua which can go back to PA *u in the context *CuCe. Korean diphthongs are generally unstable and may also reflect various contractions, but in some cases do represent original diphthongs (see below). We shall see, however, that most



CHAPTER TWO 121
original diphthongs can also be represented by Korean monophthongs, due to the general instability of Korean vocalism. The reliable sources for reconstructing the PA system of diphthongs are thus Turkic and Tungus-Manchu. We find the following rows of correspondences involving diphthongs in PT and PTM:

In some cases Turkic may have *e as an old (dialectal?) variant of *ia:

To these examples we may add a number of others where Turkic has initial *ja-, because the sequences *ja- and *jia- are not distinguished there:

We can see the following regularities here: 1. Japanese can have here only *a or *i, which would point to a distinction of two types: *CiaCa and *CiaCi. 2. In cases when Jpn. has *a, Mongolian usually has *a (*gal-, *kadaraŋ, *kari, *malu, *tasu-, *nam; exceptions are only *bilčaɣu and *seke-), whereas in cases when Jpn. has *i, Mongolian only has *e/*i (*sira, *ǯirke, *niča-, *(h)enike)
3. Korean frequently has *ă here (but also a number of *a/ə cases, with a distribution not yet clear). There is a special group of cases where all the correspondences are basically the same, but TM has *i instead of the expected *ia:
PA PTM PT PM Kor. Jpn. *k ̔ằda *xidar *kằráb- *kàjù*sắŕi *siru- *siaŕ *siraɣu *hằrk *situ *šằĺì *šilki *silbi *sắrh *sìsì *zăbsa *sibsV *jasɨmuk *sisi *sasa(n)kai *k ̔ăli *xilŋü *Kele- *kele- *kằró*zălVbi *silba- *jẹlbi- *silbe- *sjrb- *sìrà(m)p
It can be easily seen that all these cases involve words with initial fricatives and short vowels, as opposed to cases with all other initial consonants or with fricatives and long vowels. We may therefore safely postulate a rule according to which the short diphthong *-ia- changed to *-i- in PTM after fricative consonants. Thus, the correspondence rules for PA *CiaCa and *CiaCi are:



CHAPTER TWO 123
PA PTM PT PM Kor. Jpn. *ia-a *ia/*Sĭ *ia(/ja-)/e *a(/e) *ă/*A *a *ia-i *ia/*Sĭ *ia(/ja-)/e *e/i *ă/*A *i
But these are not all correspondences involving diphthongs. We also find a number of cases where Turkic has the same as above, viz. *ia or, sometimes, *e, corresponding to PJ *ə. In these cases TM has not *ia, but usually *i, while Mong. has a variation of i/e and a, and Korean, a variation of *i and *a/*ə (sometimes *jə). Here we reconstruct PA *CaCe:

A quite complicated problem is involved in reconstructing PA sequences *CaCo and *CaCu. There is a significant number of cases where Turkic has a *-ia-diphthong, Japanese shows *a, Korean, *ă or *o/u and Mongolian, *e/i. The correspondence is therefore quite similar to *CaCo (see above), and it seems plausible to reconstruct here *CaCo. PTM, however, quite unexpectedly has here a labialized vowel (*o/u):

As for *CaCu, we would (by analogy with other vocalic developments) expect here PT *ia and PJ *u. Such a correspondence, however, is completely absent. Instead we find a number of cases where the reflexes are quite similar to PA *CaCu (*a in Turkic, *a or *o/u in Mongolian, *u in Japanese, *o/u in Korean), but TM has a labialized reflex *o/u, just like in the case with *CaCo. Turkic additionally can have here *e, and Korean - (j)ə. We tentatively reconstruct the type *CaCu for this correspondence, although none of the languages (except perhaps Korean in a few cases) has preserved a diphthong here. In TM, the type *CaCu must have early coincided with *CaCo and lost the diphthong because of vowel labialization; in Turkic, the words of the type *CaCu must have early undergone an assimilative change > *CɔCu > *CöCand gave the same reflex as *CoCe (see below).

2.4.6.2 PA *o
Above we have considered a number of forms which point to PA *CaCo. There is, however, also a very similar row of correspondences where Mongolian has a back reflex *a or *o/u. Here we tentatively reconstruct PA *CoCa, since Jpn. *a may reflect both PA *-o and *-a. But since Mongolian vocalism is not the most stable and indicative one, we cannot exclude that the reconstructions *CoCa and *CaCo should be reversed. The relevant cases are:

126 INTRODUCTION
We can also see here another important distinction: although Turkic has one *-ia- case here (*siāč), it is in the vicinity of the palatal *č, and the normal reflex appears to be non-diphthongized *a (or *ạ), cf. *bạlgɨn, *basɨg, *Kaŕɨlgan, *jạgɨŕ, *bakɨr, *sagrɨ, *jạĺ(č)-, *Kasɨ-.
There is also a quite similar row of correspondences where Japanese displays not *a, but *i, and Mongolian also has a front reflex *e/i (but sometimes also labialized *ö). Here it seems plausible to reconstruct the PA sequence *CoCi:
PA PTM PT PM Kor.

The only reliable case of a diphthong in PT here is *diāĺ ‘stone’, i. e. again in a position before the palatal *ĺ. A third similar row of correspondences where we reconstruct *CoCe, differs from the preceding one in that Japanese here has either *ə or a narrowed reflex *u. Korean may have a labialized *o/u or a diphthong *jə (/*(j)a), sometimes monophthongized to *i:

128 INTRODUCTION
We see that in reflexes of PA diphthongs that we have been dealing with so far two basic principles are observed: 1. The correlation “Turkic *ia : TM *ia/*i” points to PA *a before non-labialized vowels 2. The correlation “Turkic *ia or *a : TM *o/*u” points to PA *a before labialized vowels or *o before non-labialized vowels. But there are also two other rows of correspondences where Turkic has labialized *u or *o, whereas Tungus-Manchu has *i or *ia. Japanese here has *ə (less frequently *a) or *u, thus indicating that the second vowel was *o or *u. It seems therefore natural to reconstruct here the two missing sequences: *CoCo and *CoCu, assuming that in TM there occurred a labial dissimilation in the first syllable, whereas in Turkic, conversely, labialization was retained because of assimilation to the vowel of the second syllable. The evidence is following:
*CoCo
TM has here *i; Turkic - *o/u; Mongolian - any labialized vowel; Japanese - usually *ə (but sometimes also *a); Korean - a variation of *i and *(j)ə.

2.4.6.3 PA *u
The simpliest cases where one may reconstruct a PA *u-diphthong are those where PTM has *ü (which may also be phonologically treated as *u). In all those cases Japanese has a variation of *u or *ə, and Korean, of *a/ə (sometimes preceded by -j-, and thus also pointing to a diphthong) or *u/o. Turkic and Mongolian can have either front or back labialized vowels (ö/ü, u/o). We may note, however, that there is a clear correlation between Turkic and Mongolian here: when Turkic has a back vowel, Mongolian has one, too; and, reversely, when Mongolian has a front vowel, Turkic also has a front one. It seems therefore possible to reconstruct two different PA sequences with the diphthong *-u

distinguished from each other in Turko-Mongolian. We reconstruct them as *CuCe and *CuCo respectively (reasons for determining the final vowels will be given further below): 1. *CuCe

Here Turkic may additionally have a delabialized reflex *i before liquids (*r, *l), frequently in variation with *ü. Cf.:

We see that among the listed examples, words with TM initial labials are completely lacking. In fact there are several examples with the same correspondence after labials, where PTM appears to have *u, not *ü (so that the rows are in complementary distribution):

By analogy with other vocalic rows of correspondences, one would also expect the existence of *CuCa, *CuCi and *CuCu in PA. However, the correspondences to PTM *ü are exhausted by the two correspondences described above. On the other hand, there are exactly three rows of correspondences left which involve labialized vowels in Turkic, Mongolian, TM and Korean and which have as Japanese reflexes *a, *i and *u respectively. It is therefore natural to assume that these are the rows reflecting PA *CuCa, *CuCi and *CuCu, and that the diphthong in those sequences was lost in TM, being preserved only before neutral (mid-high) vowels of the second syllable, i.e. in sequences *CuCe and *CuCo. These system considerations, apart from natural phonetic plausibility, are in fact the basic reason for reconstructing *CuCe for the correspondence TM *ü - Turkic *ü/ö and *CuCo for the correspondence TM *ü - Turkic *u/o.



132 INTRODUCTION
3. *CuCa Here TM has the usual variation of labialized *u/o. Mongolian has the same, but in some cases also a fronted *i-reflex. Turkic quite systematically displays non-labialized *ɨ, while Korean and Japanese have *a-like reflexes (*a in Japanese, *a/ə in Korean).

2.5. Prosody in Altaic
Above we repeatedly mentioned prosodic factors as reasons for certain phonetic changes in Mongolian (voicing *p > *b) and Japanese (voicing / prenasalization). The general outline of prosodic reconstruction for the first syllable was given in Starostin 1995. Here we shall confine ourselves to a brief table of correspondences.

A few comments: 1. The table above describes the behaviour of vowel length / tones only in the first syllable. As for the second syllable, it appears to have had no length distinctions, but a distinction in pitch should be probably reconstructed, on the basis of Japanese tones and voi cing of the initial consonant of the second syllable in Japanese and Mongolian, see above. The reflexes of second syllable pitch in other languages are as yet unclear. 2. Proto-Tungus-Manchu has preserved vowel length in initial syllables with original vowel length + low pitch. PTM occasionally also has vowel length on vowels of the second syllable, but its origins are as yet unclear. 3. Proto-Turkic has preserved vowel length in initial syllables with original vowel length + high pitch. Whether PT preserves any prosodic distinctions in non-initial syllables is as yet unclear. 4. Proto-Mongolian has lost all traces of the original prosody except for voicing *p > *b in syllables with original high pitch (see above). 5. Korean and Japanese appear to reflect original pitch distinction (in a contrasting manner, Japanese high tone usually corresponding to Korean low tone, and vice versa), but do not reflect vowel length. It must be said that Korean has vowel length, but it appears to have developed secondarily, due to contractions (see Ramsey 1978). Some traces of Proto-Japanese vowel length may also be preserved in Ryukyu dialects, but it is as yet unclear how the Ryukyu length correlates with Turkic or TM. 6. While evaluating tone correspondences one should keep in mind that several secondary metatonic processes happened in Japanese (on the second syllable, see above) and in Korean, basically in the verb subsystem: all verbs have a strong tendency towards low pitch on the first syllable. 7. The phonetic interpretation given above is certainly not definitive. While there is little doubt that length should be reconstructed where it is reconstructed, the entities marked as high (*ỻ) and low (*v) tones are phonetically not quite clear and their places can in fact be exchanged.



CHAPTER THREE
COMPARATIVE AND HISTORICAL PHONOLOGIES OF
ALTAIC SUBGROUPS
The phonological section of this introduction would be incomplete without an account of phonological developments in each of the Altaic subgroups. Although for the most part we use traditional reconstructions and correspondences, there are also some innovations presented and some points to discuss. Therefore we give below a short outline of the comparative-historical phonology for each of the subgroups of Altaic, as currently perceived by the authors of the dictionary.
3.1. Turkic [by A. Dybo]
The system of Proto-Turkic accepted in this dictionary looks like this:
Consonants
p b -mt d s -n- -r-, -lč j -ń- -ŕ-, -ĺk g -ŋ
Vowels of the first syllable:
iüɨu eöạo ea
All the vowels could be short or long.
Vowels of other syllables:
IU O A
The row of any non-first vowel (front or back) depended on the row of the vowel of the first syllable, thus producing seven (eight?) vocalic allophones:



CHAPTER THREE 137
i üɨ u e ö a (o)
The back -o- is actually not attested, but it may be perhaps reconstructed in some auxiliary morphemes. Thus, the reconstruction is almost completely traditional, with only the following modifications: 1. The distinction of initial voiced/voiceless consonants is primarily based on Oghuz evidence, as was already shown in Иллич-Свитыч 1963, 1965, accepted in EDT and additionally elaborated in АПиПЯЯ 6-10, Дыбо 1991 and РР 70-85. We should mention that the distinction of *g- vs. *k- is reliably reconstructed only before front vowels; before back vowels we can only reconstruct a “hyperphoneme” *K-. 2. Medial voiced/voiceless consonants: reconstruction is for the most part traditional. Details of development can be summarized as follows: the original voiced labial and velar stop are fricativized and/or lost in most languages and in most combinations with preceding and following vowels. Original voiceless consonants are regularly voiced in intervocalic position in Siberian languages and in Chuvash. In the Oghuz languages, voiceless consonants become voiced after originally long vowels; the new voiced labial becomes fricative, and even disappears in some positions, in a part of the Turkmen dialects, in Khorezmian (Oghuz) dialects of Uzbek and in Salar (details see in РР 36, 61). In the Karluk languages the voiceless labial and velar stops are regularly voiced after original long vowels, and occasionally after short ones. A similar reflexation is observed in Kypchak languages, where additional morphological analogies tend to obscure the situation: all Kypchak languages demonstrate a morphological voicing of labials and velars in an intervocalic position on a morpheme boundary. 3. O. Mudrak (Мудрак 1989, Мудрак Дисс.) has reconstructed a separate phoneme, *-j1-, reflected as -j- in Chuvash, but coinciding with *-din other languages. Since the examples of it are not very numerous, and it does not seem to have any specific Altaic origin, we have not adopted this reconstruction in the dictionary. 4. On the reconstruction of *-ń- and its distinction from the clusters *-jn-, *-jŋ- see РР 85-87 (where *-ń- is denoted as *--). Clusters are reflected as such in Oghuz languages (with a permitted vowel insertion in word-final position, and with -j- frequently lost after front vowels); Kypchak languages reveal a different development of clusters after original long and short vowels, cf. *Kojn ‘sheep’ > koj, *bejŋi ‘brain’ > mɨj as opposed to *Kājnat ‘wing’ > kanat, *Kjn ‘punishment’ > kɨjɨn, *Kōjn ‘armpit’ > kojun, *bōjn ‘neck’ > bojun.



138 INTRODUCTION
5. The problem of *ŕ and *ĺ is treated in the classical “zetacism-sigmatism” spirit, with an additional modification by O. Mudrak, who has shown (see Мудрак 1989, Мудрак Дисс.) that in Chuvash, *ĺ > l in syllable-final position, but > š (ž) between vowels; *ŕ > r, but *ŕs > s. 6. For Chuvash it has been shown that dentals and velars were palatalized not only in front of original diphthongs (čul < *diāĺ  ̔stone’, jur < *Kiār  ̔snow’), but also in front of *i, *ɨ - earlier this palatalisation was only noticed on morphemic boundaries; details see in Мудрак 1988, Мудрак Дисс.
7. For a detailed account of the reflexes of Turkic vowels in Chuvash see Мудрак 1993, Мудрак Дисс.
8. Long vowels are reconstructed on the basis of Turkmen and Yakut reflexes, taking into account also the voicing of stops after original long vowels in Oghuz languages. Short vowels are also reflected as pharyngealized in Tuva and Tofalar, as opposed to non-pharyngealized original long vowels (pharyngealization is well recorded in Бичелдей 2001, Рас. ФиЛ, Рассадин 1995); this reflexation was first formulated in Иллич-Свитыч 1963. On the preservation of long *ā and *ō in Gagauz see in РР 23-24. Besides, the distinction of *ē vs. *e is preserved in Azerbaidzhan as a distinction of close vs. open e; in Turkmen the long and short vowels also give different qualitative reflexes in some environments (e.g. *ab > ov, but *āb > āv). We prefer to regard the opposition of short vs. “half-long” vowels in Khalaj as non-distinctive (probably just phonetic variants, as can be seen from numerous variations between short and half-long in G. Doerfer’s records), but the plain long (“super-long”) vowels appear to be reasonably well derived from original long vowels. 9. One of the most complicated problems in Turkic reconstruction is the distinction of open/close *e vs. *ẹ, *a vs. *ạ. Close *ạ was reconstructed by O. Mudrak (see Мудрак 1993, Мудрак Дисс.) for the correspondence Turk. a - Chuv. ɨ, Yak. ɨ. Let us mention that Yak. can also have a secondary -ɨ- < *a in front of -j-, cf. ɨj  ̔moon’, kɨat  ̔wing’, ɨj-  ̔show, describe’. As to the reconstruction of *e and *ẹ, no final agreement has been reached so far. In the dictionary we have adopted the reconstruction of O. Mudrak (as proposed in Мудрак 1993, Мудрак Дисс.), but A. Dybo still keeps her own views, presented in Дыбо Дисс., РР 39-44. Both researchers agree that the Oghuz distinction of open *e : close *ẹ is not original. The distribution of e (=ä) and ẹ (=e) in Azerbaidzhan is complementary, e occurring after j-, in front of š, č and the Common Oghuz *j (not in front of the secondary j < *g), and ä occurring in all other cases. The Azerbaidzhan situation is thus secondary compared with

Turkmen where short open and close e are not distinguished at all. Thus, for short vowels we have two sets of correspondences: *e : Oghuz *e, Yak. e, Chuv. a *ẹ : Oghuz *e, Yak. i, Chuv. i (before nasals and r, as well as after ś ĕ)
As for the long vowels, O. Mudrak regards the Proto-Oghuz distinction (based on the correspondences between Turkmen and Azerbaidzhan) as secondary, with a rather complicated formulation of conditioning rules. The distinction *ē vs. * is reconstructed only on the basis of the correspondences *ē > Yak. ie, Chuv. a; * > Yak. ī, Chuv. i. O. Mudrak additionally introduces a “labialized” e, which yields complicated reflexes in Chuvash (in particular, i in front of l), while the Oghuz languages reflect it as e independent of neighbouring consonants; examples of this en are few and this phoneme has not been adopted in the dictionary. According to A. Dybo, the opposition of *ē vs. * in Oghuz goes back to Common Turkic and is additionally reflected in Khalaj: *ē : Oghuz *ē, Khal. ǟ, Yak. ie, Chuv. a * : Oghuz *, Khal. īe (ä after initial h-), Yak. ie, Chuv. a For a small number of examples where Oghuz, Yakut and Chuvash have a variation of close and open reflexes (and Chuvash sometimes j+vowel) she reconstructs PT *e (or *ẹ) followed by *-j- as the first element of a consonant cluster. In Chuvash initial *ej- of this type apparently gave rise to a rising diphthong; the following reconstructions are proposed: *ẹj : Oghuz *ẹ, Yak. e, Chuv. -i-/jə-, i-, Khal. ä *ēj : Oghuz *ē, Yak. ie, Chuv. -i-, Khal. īe *j: Oghuz *, Yak. ī, Chuv. -i-/ja-, Khal. īe. The details of the reconstruction, as well as precise origins of this Proto-Turkic distinction are yet to be established. 9. In reconstructing the diphthong *-ia- (long and short) we follow Владимирцов-Поппе 1924, relying on the correspondence of Turkic a (ā) to Chuv. ju- word-initially and -u- (-o-) with palatalization of the preceding consonant in a postconsonantal position. Its Mongolian parallels are, however, not as straightforward as proposed in that paper (see above on Altaic vowel correspondences). 10. Difficult, and not completely solved yet, is the problem of reconstructing vowels of non-initial syllables. Proto-Turkic probably lacked labial vowel harmony and had a distinction of labialized vs. plain vowels in non-initial syllables, independently of the features of the first syllable. This can be proved by the material of MK, as well as by Runic Turkic evidence, see e.g. Meyer 1965. This distinction is additionally



140 INTRODUCTION
reflected in some vowel-consonant combination reflexes in the Oghuz and Kypchak languages, see details in РР 44, and in the “o”-dialect of Yakut and in Uyghur, where the original second labialized vowel causes labialization of the vowel of the first syllable (as opposed to the second non-labialized vowel, causing the Uyghur Umlaut), e. g.: Uygh. xotun, Yak. xotun  ̔woman’, Orkh., OUygh. qatun (*Katun), as opposed to Yak. balɨk, Uygh. belik  ̔fish’, MK balɨq (*balɨk), Osm. jarum, Yak. jarɨm, Uygh. jerim  ̔half’, MK jarɨm (*jarɨm) etc. As to reconstructing the PT labialized low vowels, we tend to accept the hypothesis of G. Clauson (EDT), who reconstructs *o/*ö in non-initial syllables in the cases where daughter-languages reveal a variation in labialization of the first syllable and a variation between high and low reflexes of the second syllable (which may itself lose labialization): cf. the reconstructions *sigöl ‘wart’ and *süŋök  ̔bone’ in EDT. At least in Common Oghuz the reflexes of this *-ö- were redistributed: high vowel in a closed syllable, low vowel in an open one, cf. *s[e]göl ‘wart’: sögöl (OUygh.), sigil (MK), Tur. sigil, Az. zijil, Turkm. siŋŋil; *siŋök ‘bone’: süŋök (Orkh.), süŋük (OUygh.), süŋük (MK, KB), Tur. süŋük, Az. sümük, Turkm. süŋk, süjek; *sinčök ‘ankle-bone’: Tur. dial. sinǯik; but *tepö ‘hill, top’: töpü (OUygh.), tepe (Tefs.), töpü (KB), Tur. tepe, dial. depe, Az. täpä, Turkm. depe; *tikö ‘piece, part’: tikü (MK), Tur. tike, Az. tikä, Turkm. tike. See РР 45. 11. Proto-Turkic and most modern Turkic languages possess the socalled vowel harmony: all words are subdivided into “front” (with vowels *i, *e, *ẹ, *ü, *ö) and “back” (with vowels *ɨ, *a, *ạ, *u, *o). The vowel of any non-initial syllable has to be “harmonized” with the vowel of the initial syllable.

Notes. 1. In most languages (except Tur. and Gag.) > m- before a following nasal, with slightly differing rules. The same is true for (*-p-) > *-b- > *-m- in the second syllable. 2. Voicing occurs on morpheme boundaries and occasionally - in cases of morphological reanalysis (cf. cases like Tat. sɨpɨr- / sɨbɨr-  ̔to sweep’, where -ɨr- could have been re-analysed as a causative suffix). 3. Probably dialectal variants, occasionally rendered in orthography. 4. Depending on vocalic environment. 5. After labialized vowels. 6. Depending on vocalic environment and with dialect variation. 7. See more details in РР. 8. *t-, *d-, *č- > č- in front of -i-, -ɨ-. 9. -d- in the intervocalic cluster *-rt- and in the beginning of auxiliary morphemes. 10. Occasionally recorded as voiceless in Verbitskiy’s materials. 11. -d- in the beginning of auxiliary morphemes. 12. *-t-, -č- > -ǯ- in front of -i-, -ɨ-. 13. *d- > t- before the following voiceless -x-. 14. Variation in dialects and recordings. 15. Variation in dialects. 16. *s- > š- in front of -i-, -ɨ-. 17. Distribution unclear. 18. *-s- > -ž- in front of -i-, -ɨ-. 19. In some dialects lost with compensatory vowel nasalization. 20. In dialects also ǯ-. 21. In dialects also variants ǯ-, ž- before narrow vowels. 22. Normally j before a, o, ö, u, ü, ɛ; ǯ before e, i, ɨ; but the distribution may be additionally somewhat confused because of dialect variation. 23. In most languages is not distinguished from *-j-, but causes nasalization of initial *b- > m-. 24. Frequently causes nasalization of initial *j- > n-. 25. Before back vowels voiceless *k- and voiced *g- cannot be distinguished in PT; in this position we usually write *K-. 26. Depending on whether the following/preceding vowel is front or back. 27. Depending on whether the following vowel is wide or narrow. 28. Depending on whether the original following/preceding vowel was front or back.

29. Depending on whether the original following/preceding vowel was front or back. *K- > j- before an original diphthong. 30. Reconstructable only before front vowels. 31. Devoicing of final *-g is a characteristic feature of the Karluk languages; however, both in Uzbek and in Uighur it occurs irregularly, depending probably on morphological derivational analogies. 32. In the end of a polysyllabic word. Details see in РР. 33. Variation in dialects; in case of disappearance nasalization is preserved on the preceding vowel. 34. In dialects also -g- or -0-. 35. In some combinations and in the end of a polysyllabic word. 36. In combinations with palatals - n, in some vocalic environments - j. 37. Distribution not quite clear.

3.2. Mongolian [by O. Mudrak]
Unlike Turkic, all modern Mongolian languages can be sufficiently well derived from the attested Middle Mongolian language. Attempts to reconstruct for Proto-Mongolian any features absent in the written records have so far been unsuccessful. Thus, the Proto-Mongolian system reconstructed so far is practically identical with Middle Mongolian and has the following phonemes:
Consonants
b mw td n r l čǯ s j k g h/ɣ ŋ
Of these consonants, w, r and ŋ occur only word-medially; w is distinct in Written Mongolian orthography and was probably distinct from -ɣ- in Middle Mongolian, but the actual orthographic systems of



INTRODUCTION
150
Middle Mongolian do not make a difference between -w- and -ɣ(u)-. On the other hand, h- occurs only word-initially and is in clear complementary distribution with -ɣ-. A general process characteristic of Southern Mongolian languages was the voicing of intervocalic stops and transfer of their original “voicelessness” to the preceding consonant: *ZVCV > CVZV. All Southern Mongolian languages reveal, to a larger or lesser extent, the working of this general rule, which was first formulated in Helimski 1984. This “voicelessness” phonetically was probably realized as aspiration, which - in cases when there was no initial consonant - resulted in the emergence of secondary h- in Southern Mongolian: *VCV > hVZV. This h- is to be carefully distinguished from the original *h- preserved in MMong. and Dagur.
Vowels
i üu eöo a
In non-initial syllables only i, e, ü, u and a are attested; there are, however, some indications that *-ö and *-o could originally also occur in this position. Like Turkic, Proto-Mongolian and Middle Mongolian possessed vowel harmony, which has to a large extent disintegrated in modern languages, especially in Southern Mongolian. All words were subdivided into two types: “front” (with the vowels *i, *e, *ü, *ö) and “back” (with the vowels *i, *u, *o, *a): the vowel *i, therefore, was neutral in respect to vowel harmony. In the chart below we give only correspondences of the vowels of the first syllable: although the non-initial vowels are well enough recorded in MMong. and preserved in WMong., in all modern languages they became hopelessly reduced, and their quality may for the most part only be restored on the basis of the behaviour of the initial vowel. Below is a chart of phonetic correspondences between Mongolian languages.

Notes. 1. Voiceless variants in Southern Mongolian languages appear before a voiceless consonant of the next syllable. *-b- is not fricativized after nasals; in Khalkha, Ord. and Dag. also after -l-. 2. Northern languages and Dagur have a variation -m/-n at the end of a non-initial syllable. 3. In all modern languages and Middle Asiatic MMong. sources not distinguished from *-ɣ-. A difference may be observed, however, in WMong. and in Chinese MMong. sources, where the sequence -Vwtends to be rendered by a single character as opposed to the sequence -Vɣu-, usually rendered by a pair of characters. 4. In Ord. d- before the following voiceless stops. In Mongor d before following fricatives ( < *s, *č) and intervocalically; voicing did not occur, however, if the initial syllable started with a resonant or 0-. In S.-Yugh. *t- > d- before the following *-k-; intervocalic voicing occurred more or less in the same positions as in Mongor. Dong. also usually has voiced -d- between vowels, although dialectal variation is observed; *t> č- before *-e-. 5. Occasional intervocalic devoicing can be observed in Dong. (motu  ̔tree’) and Baoan (hotoŋ  ̔feather’). Mongor usually (although not completely consistently) has a devoiced t- in cases when the next syllable started with a voiceless consonant (thus *ZVCV > *CVZV). In Dong. *d> ǯ- before *-e-. 6. Syllable-final -l yields -r in Mongor, but is preserved in some dialects. 7. In Ord. - ǯ- before the following voiceless stops. In Northern Mongolian languages front (“hissing”) reflexes are observed before all vowels except *i, and occasionally also before *i - in combinations like *čiɣa-, *čiɣe-, as well as before the syllables with labial *-u- or *-ü-. Mongor and S.-Yugh. have a voiced intervocalic reflex; in a few cases initial voicing (probably assimilative) or spirantizantion are also observed. Dong. and Bao. also have intervocalic voicing of *-č-, but here it appears to be restricted to a position after initial voiceless consonants and *h-, with some dialectal variation. 8. Devoicing is observed in Mongor and S.-Yugh. before some originally voiceless consonants (which may become voiced themselves, thus *ZVCV > *CVZV). In Northern Mongolian languages front (“hissing”) reflexes are observed before all vowels except *i, and occasionally also before *i - in combinations like *ǯiɣa-, *ǯiɣe-, as well as before the syllables with labial *-u- or *-ü-.



INTRODUCTION

9. In most modern languages *j is lost before a following *-i-, frequently resulting in vocalic contractions. 10. Mongor has voicing *-s- > -ʒ- in the nominal suffix -su; it occurs, with few exceptions, after initial voiceless consonants and *h-, as well as after initial nasals and *j-. Palatalization *s > š occurs in all languages before the vowel *i; in Dong. also before *e. 11. This row of correspondences describes the behaviour of *k before or after back vowels (or *i in back-row words). Ord. has a voiced reflex before the following voiceless stop. Mongor and S.-Yugh. have initial G- before the following -(r)d-, -ǯ-. Between vowels *-k- is usually voiced in these languages (in S.-Yugh. also fricativized: -ɣ-), but it can stay voiceless if the first syllable starts with a resonant (therefore in situations when the “transfer of voice” - *ZVCV > *CVZV - was impossible). In Mongor *k is palatalized ( > ć) before *i. Dong. and Bao. have voicing in basically the same positions as in Mongor, but initial voicing may also occur before following resonants, and intervocalic voicing may sometimes occur even after a syllable starting with a resonant. 12. This row of correspondences describes the behaviour of *k before or after front vowels. The distribution of voiced / voiceless reflexes is similar to *kA. 13. This row of correspondences describes the behaviour of *g before or after back vowels (or *i in back-row words). In Mongor and S.-Yugh., voiceless x- appears before an original voiceless consonant in the next syllable (*ZVCV > *CVZV); in Mongor *k is palatalized ( > ć) before *i. Dong. and Bao. have voiceless reflexes in monosyllabic stems before a liquid (also in a few other cases, like *gasi-ɣun, probably due to assimilation). 14. This row of correspondences describes the behaviour of *g before or after front vowels. In Mongor and S.-Yugh., devoicing occurs according to the same rules as for *gA; other Southern Mongolian languages, however, do not have devoicing here. 15. In most cases *ŋ is just a variant of *n in combinations with velar consonants; it never occurs word-initially or between vowels. However, there is a distinction between *-n and *-ŋ in syllable-final position. 16. Initial *h- is well preserved in Dagur and Southern Mongolian languages. The distribution of reflexes in Mongor, Dong. and Bao. depends on following vowels. Generally (omitting some subtle details), the labial reflex is found before *u, *ü, sibilant reflexes before *i, laryngeal and velar reflexes elsewhere. 17. Intervocalic *-ɣ- is in complementary distribution with *h- (and may in fact be reconstructed as *-h-). It is rendered as -ɣ- (in the back row)



CHAPTER THREE 155
or -g- (in the front row) in WMong., reflected as -0- (or a laryngeal) in MMong. and is lost in all modern languages, usually causing vowel contractions. 18. In Kalm., ä before a following *i. In Mongor the basic reflex is a; after palatal affricates and j before a lengthened second vowel the reflex is i. In a number of disyllabic and trisyllabic words the initial *a- is lost; on the other hand, *a is lengthened > ā in disyllables with *-u in the second syllable. Dong. and Bao. have a reduction (*a > ə) in a number of disyllabic words, and Bao. has -i- after affricates. Mog. has -o- before liquids, and a lengthened reflex before *u, *i of the second syllable. 19. In Kalm. ü before a following *i. Dag. has a diphthong before a short -a- of the second syllable (the sequence *bu- in such case > *bua- > ba-), but -u- before a lengthened second -ā-. Bao. has -o- after G-, -aafter b-. Mongor has a frequent reduction *u > ə > 0, following a rather complicated system of rules. In S.-Yugh. the reduction occurs before liquids, in non-initial syllables the usual reflex is ə. 20. In Kalm. ö before a following *i. The distribution of reflexes in Dag. is similar to *u. Ord. has u in an open syllable before *-u- in the following syllable; a similar distribution is observed in Mog. Mongor has lengthening o > ō before the following *-u-; in Anlaut u- is preserved only before liquids, otherwise a reduction *u- > 0- occurs; in Inlaut Mongor has -o- or -u-, with a rather complicated distribution of reflexes. S.-Yugh. has long ō in the same context as in Mongor (i.e. before -u- of the second syllable); next to *m *o is sometimes reflected as ū. The rules of variation o~u in Dong. and Bao. are not quite clear. 21. *i is the least stable vowel in all Mongolian languages. It usually becomes assimilated to the vowel of the second syllable (the so called “breaking of the vowel *i”). The particular rules of “breaking” differ from language to language; see the description, e. g., in Poppe 1955. 22. In Khalkha, i before back affricates and clusters of -l-+affricates. In Kalm., i after j- and before back affricates. In Ord., i after j-, č-, ǯ-. In Mongor, a complicated distribution of reflexes (usually u after labials, and a variety of reflexes before liquids *r, *l, depending on preceding consonants). Dong. has -e- after affricates and j-, otherwise usually a diphthong -ie-. Labialized reflexes in all languages usually occur in Anlaut before an *-ü- of the next syllable. A labial u- (=ü-) is regular in Chinese MMong. transcriptions, MA and in Mogol; Ord. has ö- before labials, otherwise ü-; Dag. has e- before labials, otherwise ü-; Dong., Bao. and Mongor have 0- before labials, otherwise u-; S.-Yugh. has 0before labials, otherwise o-.



INTRODUCTION

23. The distribution of reflexes in Mongor and S.-Yugh. is similar to *u. In Southern Mongolian languages one has to assume an early merger of front and back labialized vowels in many contexts. 24. Ord. has ü in open syllables before the following *-ü-. The reflexes in Southern Mongolian languages are generally the same as those of *o.
3.3. Tungus-Manchu [by A. Dybo and S. Starostin]
While dealing with the TM protoforms, we have basically adopted the classical reconstruction of V. Tsintsius (Цинциус 1949) rather than its somewhat reduced version in Benzing 1955; some modifications were also introduced in Иллич-Свитыч 1965, in АПиПЯЯ and Дыбо 1990.
Consonants
pb m t d s l, r n čǯš j ń kgx ŋ
The resonants *r and *j are reconstructed only word-medially. All TM languages distinguish velar and uvular consonants; both, however, go back to a single row of velars, split according to the position adjacent to front or back vowels. In the table below we give only velar reflexes, but one should keep in mind that they are always split (k/q, g/G, x/ɣ, χ/ʁ).
Vowels
iü u eo a
One diphthong (*ia) is also reconstructed, although it is possible that the phoneme reconstructed as *ü could have also been a diphthong (*iu or *ui). All vowels could be short or long. All vowels except *o could occur both in the first and the following syllables. Unlike Turkic and Mongolian, Proto-Tungus-Manchu appears to have had no vowel harmony. Some restrictions on the coexistence of different vowels in adjacent syllables were, however, present: the back vowels *a, *o could not be combined with the front vowel *e; *u could not follow *o, *ü could not follow *i. All modern languages have developped a specific variety of vowel harmony (probably under Mongolian influence): every word may be



CHAPTER THREE 157
characterized as “back” or “front”, depending on the particular combination of vowels. Words with -a- or -o- in the first or second syllable are always “back”; words with -e- in the first or second syllable are always “front”. The -i- and -u- vowels are neutral, i. e. they may occur both in “back” and “front” words (but frequently have different allophones, depending on the row of the word). The *-ü- vowel usually occurs in “front” words, but combinations *aCü and *oCü seem also to be attested. Velars shift to uvulars in “back” words, but are preserved in “front” words. It should be mentioned that the combinations of the neutral vowels -u- and -i- are usually treated as “back”, with velars shifting to uvulars in combinations *CiCi, *CuCu, *CiCu and *CuCi, although there may be occasional variation.

Notes 1. 0- in the North Baikal dialect. 2. 0- in the Kamchatka and Arman dialects. 3. Sporadically - s- before -i-. 4. s- before *-i- and *-ia-. 5. p- in literary Nanai and in the Naikhi dialect; f- in the Bikin dialect; in Kur-Urmi usually x-, but some examples of f- are also attested, obviously because of interdialectal borrowings (the Kur-Urmi dialect historically belongs rather not to Nanai, but to the Northern subgroup of TM). 6. Intervocalic *-p- is rather stable in Ulcha, Orok and Nanai, where it is usually preserved (but occasionally can be voiced > -b-; in Bikin Nanai the standard reflex is -f-). Evenki and Even have either a stop (Evk. -p-, Evn. -b-) or a resonant (Evk. -w-/-0-, Evn. -w-/-0-). In АПиПЯЯ we reconstructed *-p- for the former, but *-b- for the latter row of correspondences. It appears, however, that they are in complementary distribution, the Evk.-Evn. -w-reflex appearing for the most part between identical vowels (in sequences *apa, *epe, *upu, *ipi, *iapa, also *opa > *opo); in a number of exceptions, where Evenki and Even have -p- between identical vowels, we are probably dealing with later vocalic assimilations. 7. All languages except Manchu usually have -w-/-0- here; Manchu has a variation -b-/-w- (occasionally also -f-). Languages of the Southern branch can also occasionally have -b- here: for the most part we may be dealing with Manchu loanwords, but a genuine dialect variation also cannot be excluded. In Northern languages (in Even, much less frequently in Evenki dialects) the reflex -ɣ- is also sometimes observed, usually before the following -u-.



CHAPTER THREE 159
In this row of correspondences, Tsintsius 1949 and Starostin (АПиПЯЯ) reconstructed PTM *-w-; in the dictionary we have adopted Benzing’s reconstruction *-b-, thus eliminating PTM *-w- from the system altogether. Note that the only reliable case where initial *w- can be reconstructed, PTM *wā-  ̔kill’, should also be rather emended to *Vbā(probably *ebā-, cf. eb- in Manchu eb-te ǵaxun  ̔hunting bird’ = * ̔killing bird’). PTM *-b- is usually well preserved in all languages in clusters with consonants (*-rb-, *-lb- etc.). 8. > ń in the position of palatalization. 9. Sporadically > č before -i-. 10. > č before -i- and -ia-. 11. Sporadically > ǯ before -i-. 12. > ǯ before -i- and -ia-. 13. The Evenki dialects are classified into s-dialects, š-dialects, h-dialects and s/h-dialects, see details in Вас. In the s-dialects *s > s; in the š-dialects *s > š; in the h-dialects *s > h; in the s/h-dialects *s- > s-, -s> -h-. 14. 0 in the Kamchatka dialect, s in the Arman dialect. 15. > š before -i-, -ia-; c or č in some old recordings. 16. On the development in Even dialects see details in РЭС. In the Kolyma-Omolon dialect *-s-, *-s > š; in the Indigir dialect *-s- > -h-; in the Arman dialect *s > č in consonant clusters. 17. All languages reveal (in various degrees) the tendency of shifting *l> n-. 18. In the Bikin dialect: č before i, otherwise c. 19. In the Bikin dialect: ǯ before i, otherwise ʒ. 20. The reconstruction of *š was introduced in АПиПЯЯ, following a suggestion of O. Mudrak. We must add that a fricative reflex, besides Manchu, is also present in the Bikin dialect of Nanai; all other languages have completely merged PTM *š and *č. 21. Initial *ń- may develop into j- between front vowels and *-ia-, although exact rules are not yet quite clear, because of a great deal of confusion between *n- and *ń- (sometimes also *ŋ-) in this position. 22. Depending on the vocalic environment. 23. Intervocalic *-k- is usually preserved. It can, however, yield -0- in trisyllabic words in Ulcha, Orok and Nanai, and occasionally also gives -0-reflexes in Oroch and Udehe (very rarely - in Even). A fricative reflex (with a not quite clear distribution) is also attested in Negidal, Solon, Udehe, Manchu and Jurchen. In a few cases in disyllabic and trisyllabic



INTRODUCTION
160
forms variants with -G- are attested in Southern languages, being probably just misrecordings for a weakened intervocalic uvular -q-. 24. Intervocalic *-g- is extremely unstable. In this position it is usually articulated as a fricative -ɣ- (in the back row alternatively recorded as -G-, -ɣ- or -ʁ-) and is best preserved in Evenki. The most frequent reflexes in other languages are -w-, -j- or -0-, depending on vocalic environment. 25. The basic reflex in Manchu is 0- (occasionally j-, sometimes nasalized to n- in front of the following nasal). The reflex x- is, however, also not unfrequent (unlike Northern languages that only have 0- here). Note that in all attested cases, Jurchen, which is actually an old Manchu dialect, still has h- (that was possibly pronounced as x-), thus a number of words with x- < *x- in Manchu may be a result of old interdialectal mixture. 26. Intervocalic *-x- is an innovation in PTM reconstruction, first proposed in Дыбо 1990. It is based on the distinction between -k- and -xin Ulcha, Orok and Nanai. Northern languages, as well as Oroch, Udehe and Manchu have completely merged the reflexes of *-k- and *-x-. Such a reconstruction seems probable for two reasons: 1) the languages that preserve the distinction between *-k- and *-x- are exactly the same languages that preserve initial *x-; 2) the distinction between *-k- and *-x- seems to reflect the Altaic distinction *-k- : *-k ̔- (see above), thus exactly parallelling the distinction *k- : *x- in word-initial position. 27. Depending on the vocalic environment; w- before a diphthong. 28. ŋ- or m- depending on the vocalic environment; w- before a diphthong; 0- before a following nasal. 29. w- before a diphthong. 30. ŋ in *Ciŋi; 0 in trisyllabic suffixed forms and in disyllables ending in a nasal (see Цинциус 1949, 44).
The Tungus-Manchu languages have also a rich system of consonant clusters, frequently yielding rather complicated reflexes. Here is the basic system of correspondences for non-standard TM consonant clusters:

Basic correspondences of Tungus-Manchu vowels:

Notes 1. Depending on the row of the word 2. Since *ü is very rare in “back” words, the reflexes like Evn. ị or Nan. o are only rarely found. 3. In non-initial back-row syllables in Southern languages we usually meet the notation -ụ-, not -o-; occasionally it also occurs in initial syllables. In Even, the notation ụ alternates with ö (in Cyrillic sources ө). 4. Notation for the reflexes of *-ia- varies significantly in Southern languages: we meet (probably synonymic) notations ia and ǟ, in Udehe also frequently eä. In polysyllabic forms this diphthongs sometimes tends to merge with *-i-. 5. Most languages tend to reduce vowels in non-initial, especially final syllables. Evenki and Nanai are the most conservative languages in this respect; Manchu and Even - the least conservative. Even, in fact, can have a special neutral reduced vowel replacing all vowels in non-initial syllables; in “front” words it is transcribed as ъ, in “back” words - as . 6. All languages except Manchu and Jurchen preserve the distinction between short and long vowels (although in the case of *ia it is somewhat obscured because of the monophthongization *ia > ǟ). Long vow

els in Manchu are secondary, going back to contractions after the loss of medial consonants. However, in existing sources for most languages length is marked extremely irregularly, with a great deal of confusion. Our reconstruction is therefore primarily based on the evidence of two most extensively and accurately recorded languages: Evenki and Nanai, the evidence of which is in most cases mutually concordant. 7. All vowels in non-initial syllables are frequently subject to reduction and morphological adjustments. In Manchu and Jurchen initial vowels are also frequently modified under the influence of non-initial ones: the rules are too abundant and detailed to be layed out here.
3.4. Korean
Korean is one language with a set of very close dialects. The earliest attestations (the Kirim wordlist) are from around the 10th century, but the wordlist is short and Chinese transcriptions seem to be applied unsystematically, so that proper phonetic interpretation is difficult (and perhaps impossible). Accurate recordings start only from the 15th century, and the language of that period (15th-16th centuries) is usually called Middle Korean. The phonology of Middle Korean is basically used as “Proto-Korean” in this dictionary, with some additional reconstruction based on morphophonemics: the alternations -p- / -w- and -t- / -r- in verbal stems indicate the existence of special intervocalic stops *-b- and *-d- in Proto-Korean (as opposed to *-p- and *-t- that did not result in any alternations). The system of PK consonants is thus presented as follows:
pbm tdn r
č ńjs k ŋ ‘(0) h
The voiced phonemes *b and *d, as said above, were not preserved in Middle Korean: they yielded voiceless reflexes (p, t) syllable-finally, and changed to -w-, -r- respectively intervocalically. The Middle Korean system therefore lacks a distinction in voice. This is one of the basic reasons why we interpret the Middle Korean ń (orthographic “triangle”) as a nasal (based primarily on the Kor. values of Chinese loanwords), not as a voiced fricative z: voiced consonants were certainly absent in Middle Korean. This solution was already accepted in АПи



INTRODUCTION
164
ПЯЯ; see also Vovin 1993 and Robbeets 2000. As for the reco nstruction of non-initial voiced consonants, we accept here the basic reconstruction proposed in Ramsey 1986, rather than the poorly grounded theory of intervocalic voicing *-VCV- > *-VZV- put forward in Martin 1996. Voiced consonants and resonants except *m and *n did not occur word-initially. Middle Korean already possessed aspirated consonants (ph, th, čh, kh), but they still were relatively rare and most probably go back to PK plain stops influenced by the *-h- of the next syllable (thus khɨ-  ̔big’ < *kɨh- etc.), or of the preceding syllable (thus manh-ta  ̔many’ > mantha, but with both variants still attested in MKor.). The process of forming aspirates was still not completed in MKor.: besides khɨ-  ̔big’ we have, e.g. ko  ̔nose’, with the endings added to the stem koh-; all modern dialects already have kho. It generally appears that the aspiration process operated earlier in verbs and adjectives than in nouns. Already in MKor. texts there was a pronounced tendency of confusing syllable-final -s, -č(h) and -t, although they are still frequently distinguished. In modern Korean dialects those consonants completely merged in -t. In modern Korean dialects this system is basically preserved, but with the following transformations: 1. Voiceless consonants have usually become voiced in intervocalic position. 2. A new series of “tense” consonants (p:, t:, k:, č:, s:) has arisen, due basically to simplification of MKor. consonant clusters (sp > p:, st, pt > t:, sk, pk > k:, pč > č:, ps > s:). 3. The nasal ń changed into j, 0 or s - with considerable variation between dialects and in different positions. 4. The laryngeals ‘ and h disappeared everywhere except word-initially. -h- disappeared completely, but left an occasional trace in the aspiration of preceding or following consonants (see above). -‘also disappeared completely; the only trace of it may be seen in the development of the combination -r’- yielding tense l: (r:). 5. The only Korean liquid r is usually articulated as r intervocalically, but as l at the end of a syllable - although the actual reflexes may differ.
The system of MKor. vowels is the following:



CHAPTER THREE 165
iɨu əo ăa
The phonetic nature of ə and ă is debatable: it is most probable that ə was originally a front *e, while ă was a mid-high vowel like ə or ʌ (it is also worth mentioning that ă is the only MKor. vowel that did not occur word-initially). Throughout the dictionary we use the traditional transcription. Like Turkic and Mongolian, Middle Korean possesses vowel harmony. Within a polysyllabic word only the vowels a/ă/o or ə/ɨ/u could be combined with each other (with a few orthographic variations); the vowel i was neutral and could occur in any of the word types. This information can be used for trying to interpret the Proto-Korean system: one of the possible interpretations is, e.g., treating o as *u, ă as *o, ə as *e, ɨ as *ö and u as *ü. Such a treatment, however, would be only speculative: while rendering of Chinese characters gives indeed good reason to think that ə goes back to *e, there is no evidence from Sino-Korean that ă and ɨ were labialized. In many cases, ă and ɨ do indeed go back to Altaic labialized vowels (see above), but by no means always: ɨ can also go back to *i, and ă to *ia, see above. It is thus best to regard the MKor. (and PKor.) system as a result of a number of different phonetic processes and restructurings, and we preserve the above system of symbols for “Proto-Korean”. All MKor. vowels could be long or short, and it was convincingly demonstrated by Ramsey 1978 that the long vowels should have originally resulted from contractions and a reduction of the vowel of the next syllable. In many individual cases, however, this is not quite clear, so we preserve the feature of length for “Proto-Korean” - although it certainly is not of Altaic origin. Finally MKor. (and probably Proto-Korean) possessed diphthongic combinations: ɨi, əi, ăi, ui, oi, ai, jə, ja (in loanwords also ju, jo). All modern Korean dialects have significantly restructured the MKor. system. Thus, in literary Korean falling diphthongs are usually monophthongized (ɨi > i, əi > e, ai, ăi > ä, ui > wi, oi > we); ă disappears ( > a or ɨ, with considerable variation); ə is preserved, but already as a back unrounded ʌ. Length is preserved in many dialects (e.g., literary Seoul), but is usually not rendered orthographically. In MKor. orthography, length was marked by two dots and thus perceived as a prosodic feature of a syllable, opposed to one dot ( = rising, or high tone) and to no dots (= falling, or low tone). Some of the modern dialects have completely lost all prosodic distinctions; some



INTRODUCTION
166
have merged the two tones, but preserve length as a prosodic feature; some appear to have preserved all distinctions. However, no systematic recordings of modern dialect prosody (except for the notation of length in S. Martin’s KED) is known to us, so we base ourselves almost exclusively on Middle Korean evidence. In Proto-Korean and Middle Korean the high and low tone are certainly distinctive; however, as was shown by Ramsey 1978 and Ramsey 1991, there is a very strong tendency in Middle Korean towards low tone on verbal and adjectival stems.
3.5. Japanese.
Japanese, like Korean, is a single language. However, it is attested considerably earlier (major literary monuments already since the 8th century), and has a much larger dialectal diversity than Korean. The phonology of all modern dialects (including the Ryukyu dialects) can be derived from the system attested in Nara texts and known as Old Japanese (a debatable question is whether some of the Ryukyu dialects - the Amami dialects - reflect the distinction of e vs. je after front (dental) consonants, the distinction that was certainly already lost in Old Japanese). However, some phonetic features of the Ryukyu dialects - such as preservation of labial *p-, *b- and dental *d- - may be actually archaic and preserve the situation preceding that of Old Japanese. Additionally, we are able to establish some pre-OJ phonological system on the basis of verbal and nominal morphophonemics. A general outline of the Proto-Japanese (PJ) reconstruction was already put forward in the seventies (see Старостин 1975), and we still keep this system, with a few modifications (notably, a reinterpretation of the OJ i-ji distinction, see below). A very similar system can be found in the works of other authors, e. g., in the largest ever compendium of Japanese historical phonology, S. Martin’s JLTT. The periodization of Japanese adopted in the present volume is like this: 1. PJ - Proto-Japanese. A reconstructed language that must have been spoken during the first centuries of our era. 2. OJ - Old Japanese. The language of the 7th-8th centuries, as reflected in early inscriptions and in the earliest Nara texts: Kojiki, Nihon shoki and Man’yōshū. 3. MJ - Middle Japanese. A rather vague term referring to all post-Nara and Pre-Meiji attested stages of Japanese. Various stages of MJ are re



CHAPTER THREE 167
ferred in literature as Late Old Japanese, Middle Japanese, Early Modern Japanese, with variously drawn chronological borders. 4. Modern Japanese - Japanese dialects attested in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The PJ system of consonants can be reconstructed as follows:
p bwm td j nrs k
In the system outlined above members of the pairs b-w and d-j are actually in complementary distribution, *b and *d occurring only word-initially, and *w and *j only intervocalically. For this reason some authors, e.g., S. Martin, prefer to reconstruct only *b and *d. However, no sources or modern dialects have any reflexes of intervocalic stops here, as opposed to word-initial position, where at least some of the Ryukyu dialects have b- (Hateruma, Yonaguni) and at least one dialect (Yonaguni) appears to have preserved d-. Historically, there certainly are cases where -w- and -j- do not go back to earlier *-b- and *-d- but are rather filling a hiatus after some consonant losses (e.g. *-g- > -0- > -w-, -j-); *-j- in some cases evidently reflects PA *-j-. In fact, although PJ *b- and *d- in very many cases reflect PA *b- and *d-, some authors (e.g. Murayama 1978) have expressed doubts in the plausibility of such reconstruction for PJ. The arguments concern mainly the reflex d- in Yonaguni: Murayama attempted to show that old records of this dialect actually reveal j-. Additionally, Old Japanese does not have a distinction of j- : 0- before the following i-vowel. In cases like isi  ̔stone’, obviously an early development *disi ( < PA *tṓĺì) > *jisi > isi had taken place. But Yonaguni has here always 0- instead of d-; it only has d- in cases where it directly corresponds to OJ j-. Still, since the only source of OJ w- and j- are PA *b-, *d- (*t-), and since the nature of Ryukyu reflexes is debatable, we keep the notation *b-, *d- for Proto-Japanese; in cases like isi  ̔stone’ we shall write *(d)isi, because there is no evidence from within Japanese whether the form was actually *disi or *isi.
Besides voiceless intervocalic stops, OJ also had voiced -b-, -d-, -g-. The general consensus now is that in most cases these voiced stops reflect PJ clusters *-mp-, *-nt-, *-nk- which are the only consonant clusters possible in PJ and may have actually been pronounced as prenasalized stops. In some cases these clusters actually reflect original PA clusters; but, as we tried to show above, in many more cases they go back to plain voiceless or voiced consonants in syllables with high pitch. It is



INTRODUCTION
168
therefore also possible to regard the OJ situation as original, or possibly as resulting from a merger of clusters *-mp-, *-nt-, *-nk- and voiced *-b-, *-d-, *-g- (from earlier plain stops).
Below we give a chart of correspondences between PJ consonants, OJ consonants and modern standard Japanese (to avoid confusion, we list the modern reflexes in standard modern romanization, where ch = /ć/, j = //, sh = /ś/, ts = /c/, z = /ʒ/). We do not list correspondences in other dialects, because they are basically the same (except for occasional different behaviour of vowel sequences originating from intervocalic consonant loss).

Notes. 1. f- before -u-, h- elsewhere; -w- before -a-, -0- (with vowel contractions) elsewhere. 2. *b- is not reconstructed before *-u-; in Tokyo w- before -a-, 0- elsewhere. 3. -w- before a, -0- (with vowel contractions) elsewhere. 4. ch before i, ts before u, t elsewhere. 5. *d- is not reconstructed before i (see above). 6. j before i, z before u, d elsewhere. 7. 0 before i, e, y elsewhere. 8. sh before i, s elsewhere. 9. j before i, z elsewhere.



CHAPTER THREE 169
Vowels
The Proto-Japanese system is reconstructed as consisting of four vowels:
iu ə a
and five diphthongs: ia, ua, ui, əi, ai.
There may be some indications in Ryukyu (basically Okinawa) dialects of the existence in PJ of a vocalic length distinction; the problem is, however, far from clear and requires further investigation. The diphthongs (except *ua in some cases) themselves have evolved from earlier contractions, see above, and the discussion in Старостин 1975 and JLTT 57-64. Below we give a chart of vocalic correspondences between PJ, OJ and standard modern Japanese:
PJ OJ Tokyo i1 (j)i i uu u əo o aa a ia2 (j)e e ua3 (w)o o ui i i əi i i ai e e
Notes. 1. OJ ji is distinguished from i after velar and labial consonants; the distinction is neutralized after dentals. 2. OJ je is distinguished from e after velar and labial consonants; the distinction is neutralized after dentals. 3. OJ wo is distinguished from o after dental and velar consonants; the distinction after labials also existed, but was already disappearing during the Nara period, and in most cases is difficult to be recovered from the writing system.
Prosody
The reconstruction of the PJ accentology is based on the accented Middle Japanese (11th century) dictionary “Ruijumyōgishō” (RJ) and on modern dialect data. RJ regularly marks high pitch (Ỻ) with a single upper dot, and low pitch (Ỽ) - with a single lower dot. The system of



INTRODUCTION
170
OJ accents is unknown, but a good guess is that it was close to the system attested in RJ. A discussion of the phonetic interpretation of the Middle Japanese and PJ accent system see in АПиПЯЯ 64-67, 136-137. With the exception of the Kyoto “circumflex” pitch, all dialectal accent systems are well derivable from the RJ accents, with the following correspondences:
a) Monosyllabic nouns
PJ RJ Kyoto Tokyo Kagoshima PR Shuri Hateruma *Ỻ, *Ỻ-nká
kó, -gá ‘child’
kṓ, -gá kò, -ga kó, kó-gà *A ké ‘hair’
k
*Ỽ, *Ỽ-nká
tà, -gá ‘field’
tā, t-gá tá, -ga tà, tà-gá *B t t
The first type here corresponds to Martin’s 1.1 or H(H), the second to Martin’s 1.3a or L(L). Martin (JLTT 179-182, 600-602) reconstructs two more accent types for monosyllabic nouns, namely 1.2 or H(L) and 1.3b or L(H). We should say that the number of words in the two latter classes is quite insignificant, and the correspondences far from clear. The type 1.3b is most probably just a collection of irregularities, while the type 1.2 may have some reality, since Kyoto has a distinct pitch pattern here (marked by Hirayama as 1;25). However, the number of words in this class (of which the most common one is n  ̔name’) is quite small and it may well be an innovation in Kyoto-type dialects. It seems not quite probable that monosyllabic nouns had possessed more than two distinctive types of pitch.

Here type 1 is Martin’s 2.1 or HH(H); type 2 is Martin’s 2.2b or HL(L); type 3 is Martin’s 2.3 or LL(L); type 4 is Martin’s 2.4 or LH(H); and type 5 is Martin’s 2.5 or LH(L). Martin also lists a type 2.2a or *HH(L) which differs from type 2.2b in Tokyo-type dialects (instead of VỺ - ỼV), but he himself expresses doubts about its existence (JLTT 162); most of the words of this type probably just exhibit occasional irregularities or are a result of interdialectal influence. Type 5 no doubt exists, but differs from type 4 only in Kyoto-type dialects and is not reflected in RJ - which is certainly a recording of the old Kyoto-type dialect. Therefore one also cannot exclude here a later Kyoto innovation - although its origins are not yet clear. It has been argued that nouns of this type go back to an earlier structure *CVCVN, with a word-final nasal, but the arguments in favour of such a solution are clearly insufficient.

Although other accent patterns are also possible (Martin also lists: 3.1a or *HHH(L); 3.2a or HHL(L); 3.2b - also HHL(L), but with different behaviour in Tokyo type dialects; 3.3 or HLL(L); 3.5a or LLH(H), but with different behaviour in Tokyo type dialects; 3.7a or *LHH(L)).

Martin (JLTT198-204) distinguishes only two verbal accent classes: type A (corresponding to our *Ỻ- and *ỺỺ-) and type B (corresponding to our *Ỽ- and *ỼỼ-); the type *ỼỺ- is labelled as B . It contains only a few verbal stems and Martin may be right in regarding it as secondary.

These two types correspond to Martin’s type A and type B respectively. RJ contains also a few adjectival stems with the accent ỼỺ-, the origin of which (just as of the verbal *ỼỺ- type) is not quite clear; their reflexes coincide with the type *ỼỼ- in all dialects.



CHAPTER FOUR
ELEMENTS OF A COMPARATIVE MORPHOLOGY OF
ALTAIC LANGUAGES
4.1. Derivation in Proto-Altaic
A dictionary is not a proper place for a comprehensive comparative grammar. However, knowledge of derivational morphology is absolutely necessary for evaluating proposed etymologies: in a vast number of cases we are faced with the inevitability of comparing different suffixed word forms. Here is the list of basic suffixes, with an explanation of their functions and examples.
4.1.0. PA *-0
Although parts of speech, at least nouns and verbs, are clearly distinguishable in all Altaic languages, 0-derivation (conversion) is also not an uncommon phenomenon. It is especially frequent in TM languages (cf. numerous cases like *idu- ‘to command’: idu ‘order’, *xila-ga ‘flower, ornament’ : *xila-ga- ‘to adorn’ etc.), rather common in Mongolian (*kele- ‘to speak’, *kele ‘tongue, speech’, *čimki- ‘to pinch’, *čimki ‘a pinch’ etc.). The phenomenon is less common in Turkic and Korean, and is absent in Japanese (in the latter case because a derived noun always ends in *-i and is thus formally distinct from the verbal stem; this -i, however, may be a late addition, so that in pre-Proto-Japanese 0-conversion could have been quite normal).
4.1.1. PA *-b
The basic function of this suffix, as described in EAS 2, 157-160 (cf. also Vovin 1997, 8), is passive / causative, and it is quite productive in TM (see Benzing 122-123). A *-b- (-p-/-w-) suffix is widely attested in Korean, and a *-p- suffix - in Japanese, although their function is less obvious here: in Japanese the suffix is frequentative or just stem-forming, in Korean it is basically used in politeness forms, probably reflecting the original passive semantics. In Mongolian, as Ramstedt writes, this suffix - due to its phonological weakening - can be clearly detected only



INTRODUCTION
174
in clusters with preceding liquids, and has lost productivity. We must add that the suffix may be in many cases preserved as -ɣe- / -ɣi- > -ji-, but without external evidence it would be difficult to trace it to *-b-. Finally, in Turkic, there are just a few cases when *-b- is preserved as -b- after liquids; in some cases it disappears without a trace, leaving only vowel labialization (*-Vb- > -u), and is generally rather poorly preserved. PA *ărV ‘witchcraft, craft’ (PT *ar- ‘to deceive, make magic’; PTM *ar‘to come to one’s senses; appear in one’s imagination’): PT *ar-ba- ‘to make magic; deceive’, PTM *ar-bu- ‘shape, form’ PA *bójĺo ‘to learn, be attentive’ (not attested suffixless, see under *-gV): PM *bol-ba- ‘trained, educated’, PJ *bsí-pa- ‘to teach’ PA *č ̔uli ‘to grow less, shrink’ (PK *čūr-): PM *čölüji-, Evk. čul-biPA *dure ‘to burn, set fire’ (Bur. düre-, Evn. dur-): PM *dür-be- ‘to blaze, flame’, Man. do-bu- ‘to set fire’ PA *ḗŕa ‘to go astray, mistake’ (PT *āŕ-, Evk. ere- ‘to be mistaken’, PJ *árá- ‘to behave violently’: PM *ere-ɣü ‘torture, crime’, PTM *eru- (= *eru-bu-) ‘bad, torture’, PK *rj-b- ‘to be difficult, in distress’ PA *gla ‘thin, short’ (Nan.

CHAPTER FOUR 175
PA *t ̔ja ‘be calm, quiet’ (PTM *teje-, PJ *tàjá-): PM *taji-bu-, PTM *teje-ba-n-, PJ *tàjù- (with a regular development *-b- >-w-(-u-) after -j-) As noted by Ramstedt, at least in some cases (Evk. duku- ‘write’, duku-wu-n ‘smth. written, letter’) the same suffix may form Nomina actionis, and indeed, it is probable for forms like PTM *ar-bu- or PM *ere-ɣü.

PTM *(x)üme-nse ‘strap’, *(x)üme-le- ‘to girdle’): PM *(h)umu-ji- ‘to tighten, shrink’, PK *ùm-i- ‘to pucker, close up’, PJ *m-pí ‘belt’ PA *t ̔ắk ̔ì ‘to sacrifice, respect’ (PM *taki-): PT *toku ‘ceremony’, PTM *taKu(b)-, PJ *tíká-p- ‘to take oath’ PA *dle ‘to spend the night’ (PM *düli- ‘to spend the night’): PTM *dol-ba ‘night’, PJ *duà ‘night’ (the development of *-lV-b- > -0 in Jpn. is similar to cases of *-RVg-, *-RVŋ- > -0, see below) In a few cases, *-b- seems to be denominative, but this is probably due to secondary nominalization of the original verbal stem in Turkic: PA *áĺa ‘female; to seduce’ (PT *eĺi ‘woman’): PK *r-bù- ‘to seduce, be flirty’, PJ *ásuá-mp- ‘to play’ PA *rV ‘open space’ (PT *(i)āra ‘space, distance’): PM *arba- ‘to stretch (of fingers)’, PTM *ar-bu- ‘space between two river branches’ However, in a small, but significant number of cases *-b- seems to be purely denominative, forming nouns from nouns, with not quite clear semantic differentiation (originally collective?): PA *ătV ‘horse’ (PT *ăt): PM *adu-ɣu- ‘cattle, horse’, PTM *abdu- ‘cattle, herd’ PA *grè ‘word, name’ (PM *gere ‘witness’, PK *kr ‘poetry, letter’, PJ *kt ‘word, speech’): PM *gere-ɣe ‘witness’, PTM *ger-bǖ ‘name’, PK *kr-b-r ‘poetry, letter’, PJ *kt-pà ‘word, speech’ PA *kádù ‘a k. of harness’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PTM *kada-la, -ra): PM *kada-ɣa-r ‘bridle’, PK *kùr-bi > *kùr’i id., PJ *kútú-wá id. (note the -w-reflex here - either reflecting a form like *kádù-j-bV, or else a result of contamination with PJ *ba ‘ring’) PA *níre ‘a k. of foliate tree’ (PJ *níra-i): Evk. ńirāwi ‘a k. of poplar’, PK *nr-p ‘elm’ PA *p ̔ḗra ‘bee’ (PT *ārɨ, PJ *pátí): PM *her-be-kei, Evk. herē-p-ti-n

4.1.2. PA *-p ̔
Because of the similarity of reflexes, it is difficult to distinguish the PA *-b- and *-p ̔- suffixes. A deverbative instrumental suffix *-pu-n is, however, well established for PTM (see Benzing 63), and it seems to have clear external correlates at least in a number of cases: PA *t ̔ùŋo ‘staff, pole, lean on a pole’ (PTM *tüjŋe-, both nominal and verbal): PM *tuji-ban, PTM *tüjŋe-pun, PJ *tùmìpá
PA *kóšì ‘lever’ (PM *kösi- ‘to prop, lever’): PTM *kuši-pu-n ‘pole, lever’, PJ *kúsàpì ‘wedge’ PA *módè ‘bend, circle’ (PTM *moda- ‘bend’): PK *mùrV-p ‘knee’, PJ *mt-pə-r- ‘to turn round’ PA *pbi ‘to mince, saw’ (PT *bij-, PTM *pubu-, PJ *piwa-): PTM *pubu-pu- ‘saw’, PK *pjàpắi- ‘to mince’ In the last two examples we see a secondary noun->verb conversion in Japanese and Korean. Similar verbal semantics is observed in: PA *nìbi ‘to smoke, smell’ (PK *nắi ‘smoke’): PTM *nibu-p- ‘to smoke’, PJ *nìp-p- ‘to smell’ PA *ǯrVko ‘courage, joy’ (PM *ǯirga-, PTM *ǯurga-): PK *črk-p-, PJ *drk-p
PA *ǯē ‘to eat’ (PT *jē-, PK *čā-si-): PM *ǯa-ɣu-g ( > *ǯoɣog) ‘food’, but PTM *ǯe-p- ‘eat’, PJ *da-pa- ‘hungry’ PA *íru ‘sing, song’ (PT *ɨr, PJ *útà): PM *ira-ɣu ‘melodious sound, harmony’ [but possibly < PT *ɨragu]; PK *r-p- ‘to chant’, PJ *útá-p- ‘to sing’ On verbal *-p(u)- in TM see Benzing 117, 122; this suffix has become extremely productive in Japanese. In all of these cases it is in fact possible to suppose original verbal semantic and nominal passive/instrumental derivation (“smth. which is X-ed” or “smth. with which one X-es”), with subsequent noun/verb conversions.
4.1.3. PA *-m
Ramstedt (EAS 2, 104-114) gives numerous examples of the usage of PA *-m- as a nomen verbi, still quite productive in Turkic and Korean (Turk. alɨm ‘taking’ etc.). Because of productive noun/verb conversion, in many cases we can observe further verbalization of such nouns; in Japanese, in fact, the suffix is predominantly verbal (while the *-m-i nouns appear already secondarily derived). Vovin (1997, 3) regards the PJ circumflex pitch as reflecting the same suffix (*kùrâ ‘dark colour’ <



CHAPTER FOUR 177
*kúrá-m), but there does not seem to exist enough evidence to corroborate such a development. In the same paper (p. 6) he reconstructs a “gerund” in *-mye (PJ *-mi, Kor. -mjə, Man. -me) which is in fact a combination of the deverbative *-m- with the gerund suffix *-jV (on which see below). Consider the following cases: PA *gằju ‘sorrow, be sorry’ (PM *gaj): PK *kəi’ə-m ‘envy’, PJ *kùjà-m- ‘to feel sorry, regret’ PA *rú ‘omen, divination; to divine’ (PJ *ùrá): PT *ɨrɨ-m ‘omen’, PTM *īr-me- ‘to ask’ PA *kălo ‘to change, borrow’ (PM *kala- ‘to change’, PK *kắr- id., PJ *kár‘to borrow’): PT *Kalɨ-m ‘ransom’, PTM *kalma-gda ‘rich bride’ PA *kara ‘to look, observe’ (PM *kara-): PM *kara-mu-l ‘sight’, PTM *kara-ma- ‘to guard, protect’, PK *kàr-m- ‘to keep, preserve’ PA *kuču ‘to cry, cough’ (PM *kuča- ‘to bark’): MMong. xuča-m ‘barking’, PK *kìčh-m ‘cough’, PJ *kusa-ma- ‘sneeze’ PA *núra ‘to pile, stack’ (Man. nora-): Chuv. śorъm ‘stack’, PM *norum id. PA *sk ̔ù ‘hollow, crack; to stick into’ (PT *suk- ‘stick in, insert’, PTM *sixa- ‘hollow vessel’, PK *skí- ‘to insert, sheath’, PJ *súk- ‘be hollow’): OT suqɨm ‘hollow wood’, PK *sk-m ‘crack’ (cf. also Jpn. suki-ma)
PA *tál[u] ‘be together’ (PK *tằrí-, PJ *túrá-): PT *deli-m, PM *dali-m, PK *tăr-m
This *-m- should probably be distinguished from the optative *-m-, observable in several branches of Altaic (see below). Another function of PA *-m- (see EAS 2, 218-220) is denominative adjectival, well preserved in TM (*-ma, see Benzing 66, 90 and *-mi, see Benzing 90) and Mongolian (*-maj), and observable in a large number of Common Altaic derivatives:
PA *zejĺu ‘metal’ (PTM *sele, PK *sói, PJ *sunsu): PT *jel-me, PM *sele-me ‘sable’ ( = PTM *sele-me ‘metallic’) PA *č ̔ēk ̔V ‘a k. of cloth’ (PT *čēk ‘cotton shirt’, Man. čeke ‘upper short clothes’): PT *čēk-me-n ‘a k. of upper cloth’, Man. čeke-mu ‘velvet’ PA *dărV ‘back, waist’ (PT *jarɨ-n ‘shoulder, shoulder-blade’, PM *dere ‘pillow’): PM *dere-m-deg ‘pillow’, PTM *dara-ma ‘waist, back’ PA *kàra ‘thin stick, rod’ (Evk. kar(i) ‘rod, thin branch’): PT *Kar-ma-k ‘fishing rod, hook’, PK *kár-mó ‘axle’, PJ *kàri-m ‘id.’ PA *kúra ‘sheath, basket’ (PM *kor ‘quiver’, Evk. kor ‘dish made of birch bark’): PT *Kur-ma-n ‘wooden vessel, quiver’, PM *korum-(saga) ‘quiver’, PTM *kor-ma-ki ‘sheath’, PJ *kátá-ma ‘basket’

PA *kúro ‘a k. of clothes’ (PT *Kur ‘belt’): PM *kor-ma-j ‘lap. skirt’, PTM *kuru-mV ‘a k. of upper clothes’, PK *korɨ-m ‘clothes string, lace’, PJ *kr-m ‘clothes’ PA *k ̔ge ‘palate, jaw’ (PJ *k(ù)i ‘fang’): PT *Kög-me ‘gum (of tooth)’, PM *köɣe-me ‘throat, pharynx’, PK *khú-m ‘jaw’ PA *móńù ‘heart; breast’ (PJ *múnà-): PTM *miańa-m, PK *mằńằ-m PA *t ̔à ‘top of head, head’ (PK *utu): PTM *utu-mu-k ‘back of head’, PJ *àtàmà ‘head’ PA *sela ‘bolt, hinge’ (PTM *sele ‘arrow, cross-bow’, PJ *saru ‘bolt’): PT *sal-ma ‘horse noose’, PTM *selu-mi ‘cross-bow’ PA *p ̔èrì ‘edge’ (PM *hir, PTM *pere, PJ *piàrì): PM *hir-meg, PTM *pere-mǖ
PA *p ̔orV ‘trace’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PT *oru-k ‘path, road’): PM *horu-m ‘trace’, PK *pòróm ‘sign’ In TM nouns in *-m- could be verbalized, giving rise to specific derivatives like *xulukī-m-a- ‘to hunt for squirrels’ etc. (see Benzing 116-117). Note also the usage of *-m- in some animal and plant names: PA *dari ‘a small animal’ (suffixless in PT *jar-Kiajnat ‘bat’): Orok daramị(n) ‘otter’, PK *tằràmí ‘flying squirrel’ PA *kàrà ‘a k. of weed, cockle’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PM *kara-ɣu ‘darnel grass, smut’, Kor. kara-ǯi ‘Setaria viridis’): PT *KAra-mu-k ‘cockle’, (?) PM *kar-ba-ɣur ‘a k. of shrub or weed’, PJ *kàrà-mù-sì ‘a k. of hemp’ PA *sera ‘a k. of garlic’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PM *sara-na): PT *sarɨ-m-sak, PM *sar-mu-g
In some of the examples above, as well as in the following, *-m- appears in a combination with further suffixes: PA *ṓre ‘to plait, weave’ (PT *ȫr-, PM *ör-, PK *ōr, PJ *r-): PT *ör-mek, PM *ör-mege ‘woven cloth’ PA *k ̔áru ‘a k. of cloth’ (PK *kòró ‘satin, ornamented silk’): PT *KAr-s (probably by contraction < *KArm-s- = PM *kor-mu-su-) ‘a k. of upper clothes’, PM *kor-mu-su- ‘thin silk kerchief’, PTM *xara-mu-sa ‘thigh covers, stockings’
4.1.4. PA *-d
This suffix is found in a large number of stems, and its primary function seems to have been adjectival / adverbial when used as a denominative (sometimes, through conversion, yielding nouns or verbs again; on the denominative verbal *-dā- in TM see Benzing 116). Cf.:



CHAPTER FOUR 179
PA *ămV ‘quick, timely’ (PT *(i)am ‘now’, PTM *am(a) ‘quick’, PK *ām ‘surely, certainly’): PT *(i)am-dɨ ‘now’, PM *(h)am-ǯi- ‘to be on time’ PA *ḗgó ‘big, many’ (PM *aɣu- ‘large, very’, PK *há- ‘to be great, many’): PM *aɣu-da- ‘large, wide’, PTM *eg-di ‘big, many’ PA *gók ̔ì ‘high, peak’ (PK *kòkái, PJ *kúkì ‘peak’): PM *gög-de- ‘high, lofty’, PTM *gug-da ‘high’ PA *ámu ‘hole, pit’ (PT *(i)am ‘vulva’, PTM *umu- ‘hole, nest’, PJ *úmá‘to dig’): PM *(h)uma-da-g ‘lower part of belly’, PTM *um-de-k- ‘hole, nest’ PA *méŋu ‘whole’ (PJ *mú-i): PM *men-dü ‘healthy’, PTM *meŋ-de‘whole’, PJ *mui-(n)tuPA *muk ̔u ‘blunt, hornless’ (PT *muk-, PM *mökü): PM *mug-ǯi-, PTM *mug-de-ke, PK *mìth
PA *mùne ‘defect, lack’ (PT *bün): PM *mun-du- ‘to become insufficient’, PJ *màn-tù- ‘poor’ PA *ńoŋe ‘cold’ (PT *jEŋ ‘frazil’): PM *ǯiŋ-de- ‘to suffer from cold’, PTM *ńuŋ-de- ‘cold’ PA *ṓni ‘high’ (PT *ȫn-): PM *ön-dü-, PK *un-tu [if *-nt- can reflect *-nd-], PJ *un-tu PA *sago ‘old, age’ (PK *sằ-n ‘grown up’): PM *seɣü-de-r ‘age’, PTM *sag-da- ‘senior, old’ PA *soga ‘arrow’ (PJ *sa): PM *saɣa-da-g ‘quiver’, PJ *sà-já ‘sheath’ PA *p ̔ole ‘blanket, skin (as covering)’ (PJ *pərə): PT *El-di-ri ‘skin of kid or lamb’, PM *hel-de- ‘to dress (leather)’ This *-d- may originally have represented the same morpheme as the locative case marker *-dV (on which see below). Due to adjective->noun conversion, PA *-d- has in many cases become just a nominal stem-marker without any specific meaning - especially in Mongolian where we have a rather large class of nouns ending in -du(n). Cf.: PA *k ̔p ̔à ‘bark, skin’ (PJ *kapa): PM *kaw-da- ‘bark; page’, PTM *xab-da-(nsa) ‘leaf’, Kor. dial. kəp-te-gi ‘bark, skin’ PA *p ̔ĺo ‘star’ (PK *pjr, PJ *psí): PT *jul-du-ŕ, PM *ho-du etc. Cases of deverbatives in *-d- are rare, but also attested: PA *múnu ‘be wrong, mad, uneasy’: (PT *bun-, PM *muna- ‘to become mad’): OT munduz ‘mad, foolish’, PM *mun-dur ‘shame’, PJ *mún-tú-ka- ‘difficult’ PA *šk ̔i ‘urine, urinate’ (PT *sīk, PTM *šiKē-): PT *sīg-d- > *sīd-, PM *siǯi-ŋ, PTM *šikte-, PK *stò-ŋ, PJ *sitə
PA *t ̔ukV ‘fall, drop’ (PTM *tüK-): PTM *tüg-de ‘rain’, PK *td



INTRODUCTION
180
PA *t ̔ula ‘to intend, reason’ (PM *tula-, PTM *tul-): PT *Tɨl-da, PM *tul(a)-da
Since in these cases the suffixless stem may be both verbal and nominal, it seems reasonable to assume that here we are also in fact dealing with *-d- in an original adjectival function (see above) (e.g. *’rain (n.)’ -> *’rainy (adj.)’ > *’rain (n.)’ again).
4.1.5. PA *-t- (intransitive ~ passive)
The assumption of a suffix *-d- in Turkic monosyllabic verbal stems (*tod-, *jod-, *kod- and *jüd-) led Ramstedt (EAS 2, 162-163) to reconstruct a “continuative” verbal suffix *-d- (also reflected as Mong. *-d-, but, significantly, never within exact Turk.-Mong. lexical matches). It seems, however, that such a *-d- suffix in Turkic does not exist (all the above verbal stems have more plausible whole-root etymologies), whereas there is a number of cases where Turkic verbal *-t- corresponds to Mong. *-d-, e. g.: PA *ăĺi ‘to know, to hear’ (PT *ala- ‘to tell’, PK *ār- ‘to know’): PT *ẹĺi-t‘to hear’, PM *al-da-r ‘fame’ PA *ĕju ‘to speak, sound’ (PT *ajɨ- ‘to say’, PM *aji ‘sound, voice’, Evk. ejē ‘demand’): PT *ạjɨ-t- ‘to say, demand’, PM *aji-da- ‘to cry, recite’, PTM *ejē-t- ‘to ask’ This is exactly the correspondence that reflects PA *-t- (see above); we may note, however, that if preceded by resonants, PA *-t- here rather gives a voiced reflex in TM (in Turkic, where *-lt-/*-ld- and *-rt-/-rd- are very difficult to distinguish, we usually have *-ld-, but *-rt-): PA *li ‘to deceive; be angry’ (PT *Āl ‘deceit, trick’; PTM *ali- ‘to be angry’): PT *āl-da- ‘to deceive’, PJ *ira-t- ‘to be nervous, angry’ PA *enV ‘pain, sickness’ (PTM *enū ‘illness, pain, to feel pain’): PT *eni-t- ‘to become confused, suffer’, PTM *enū-t- ‘to feel pain, be sick’ PA *gno ‘to think’ (PM *guni ‘be sad’, PTM *gūn- ‘to think; to say’): Ord. Guni-d- ‘be sad’, PTM *gūn-de- ‘to say, think’. PA *ùbú ‘to be hungry, exhausted’ (Man. uba- ‘to become spoiled (of meet)’, PK *īb- ‘to wither, dry up’, PJ *ùwá- ‘to be hungry’): PM *öje-de- ‘to be exhausted’, PTM *(x)ob-da- ‘to be exhausted, become spoiled (of meat)’ PA *uju ‘sad, ashamed’ (PM *uji, PJ *u-): PT *uja-t- (also with a strange variant *ujad- in Old Turkic), PM *uji-d



CHAPTER FOUR 181
PA *dḕ ‘to lie’ (PTM *dē ‘bed’): PT *jạ-t- ‘to lie’, PTM *dē-du- (with assimilation) ‘to lie’, PJ *dà-nt-r- ‘to spend the night’ PA *làku ‘dirt, dregs’ (PM *lag): PM *lag-da- ‘to become sticky, dirty’, PTM *lak-ti- ‘to be burnt (of food)’ PA *more ‘to hurt, damage, wound’ (PM *mer, PJ *miar-): PT *bEr-t-, Evk. mur-du-l
PA *p ̔re ‘fire, burn’ (PTM *puri- ‘to dry over fire’, PK *pr ‘fire’): PT *ör-t ‘flame’, PM *(h)ör-de- ‘to burn, flame up’ PA *bāla ‘child, young’ (PT *bāla): PT *bāl-dɨŕ ‘wife’s younger sister’, PM *bal-či-r ‘very young, infant’, PTM *bal-di- ‘to bear, be born’ We see that the verbs with the -t-suffix are usually intransitive, thus the original meaning may have been reflexive or even passive (if passive *-t- was opposed to causative *-b-, on which see above). In a few cases, however, the same suffix is used denominatively and semantically exactly duplicates the PA adjectival *-d- (on which see above): PA *k ̔ŏbe ‘touchwood, tree fungus’ (PT *K(i)ab ‘tree fungus’, PJ *kua ‘mushroom’): PM *köb-dü ‘moss’, PTM *xub(u)-te ‘touchwood’ PA *k ̔ŏjli ‘limb, extremity’ (PT *Kol ‘arm’, PM *köl ‘foot’): PT *Kol-tuk ‘armpit’, PTM *xol-da-n ‘side, thigh’ PA *púŋu ‘a k. of fish’ (PJ *pùnâ): PT *bɨŋɨ-t, PM *boŋ-či-liki, PTM *poŋ-dV, PK *pì’ú-t
PA *ǯap ̔e ‘bare, saddleless’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PTM *ǯipu-čān ‘fur coat worn on bare body’): PT *jạpɨ-tak, PM *ǯaji-daŋ ‘saddleless’.
4.1.6. PA *-t ̔
Proto-Turkic *-t- is more frequently transitive (and even causative), and in this function it continues PA *-t ̔- (on Turk.-Mong. matches see Ramstedt 1912, 21-23). Cf. the following cross-language matches:
a) denominative and deverbative transitive PA *nda ‘to do wrong’ (PM *(h)anda- ‘to err, mistake’, PTM *(x)an(d)u‘to accuse’): PTM *(x)an(d)u-t- ‘to tease’, PJ *áná-t-ur- ‘to despise’ PA *pi ‘to enjoy, rest’ (PTM *ā(b)- ‘to sleep’): PT *(i)abɨ-t- ‘to comfort’, PK *ìpà-tí ‘feast’ PA *ắmo ‘mouth; taste’ (PT *um- ‘to hope for, desire’; PM *ama(n) ‘mouth’; PJ *ámá- ‘tasty, sweet’): PM *am-ta ‘taste’, PTM *am-ta- ‘to taste’, PJ *ántí ‘taste’. PA *k[ā]p ̔á ‘to cover’ (PT *Kāp- ‘to cover’, *Kāp ‘sack’, PTM *kupu- ‘to cover’, *kupu ‘covering’): PM *kab-ta-ga ‘sack’, PTM *kup-tu- ‘to cover’, *kup-tu- ‘covering, hat’, PJ *kàmpú-tua ‘helmet’



INTRODUCTION
182
PA *màga ‘glory, praise’ (not attested suffixless, cf. Orch. magui- ‘to shamanize’, PK *mā-r ‘speech’, PJ *màw-s- ‘to speak’): PT *bAga-tu-r ‘hero’, PM *mag-ta- ‘to praise, glorify’, Evk. mig-di - ‘to be noisy’ PA *pŋa ‘to separate, emit’ (PK *pɨŋɨ- > *ph-): PTM *piŋ-ta-, PJ *pànà-tPA *p ̔ăp ̔a ‘shaman, to shamanize’ (PM *hab): PM *hab-taj, PTM *pap-taPA *umuŋo ‘to forget’ (PTM *omŋa-): PT *umnɨ-t, PM *um-ta
b) verbs of motion: PA *ǯi ‘to come’ (PTM *ǯi-): PT *jẹ-t-, PM *ǯi-d-küPA *ḗjba ‘to hurry’ (PT *ēb-): PM *(h)aba-d ‘at once, instantly’, PJ *áwá-tá‘to hurry’ PA *ĺki ‘to run away’ (PJ *nìnká-): PM *ǯigu-tu- ‘to run away’, Evk. luk-ti-n- ‘to run some distance’ PA *nk ̔é ‘to pass’ (Evk. nök- ‘to loose way’): PM *nög-či- ‘to pass’, Nan. nuk-te- ‘to move to another location’ PA *t ̔ja ‘to float, slide’ (PT *tāj-, PTM *tia-): PM *taji-tu-, PJ *taju-ta-pJust as with *-t-, there seems to be a number of suffixed denominative (less frequently deverbative) *-t ̔-cases with adjectival ( ~ ->nominal) meaning, and it would seem to be natural to equate this suffix with Mong. (productive) adjectival -tu and Japanese -tu id.: PA *bolo ‘all, completely’ (PT *bile / *bula): PM *bul-tu, PTM *bil-[t]iPA *bugu ‘joint’ (PTM *bogi-ja- ‘cuff, wristband’, PJ *pu ‘joint, knot’): PM *bog-tu ‘collar bone, shoulder bone’, Ud. bog-do-lo ‘shoulder’ PA *k ̔épà ‘side’ (PJ *kápá): PT *Kap-ta-l ‘side’, PM *kab-ta-su ‘side boards on saddle’, Evn. ewu-t-le ‘side’ PA *láp ̔ì ‘flat, broad’ (PK *nàp- / *np- ‘level, wide’, PJ *nípá ‘yard’): Tuva čɨ ̔pɨ-t ‘flat’, PM *lab-ta- ‘to be flat, level’, PTM *lap-ta- id. PA *p ̔ŭŕi ‘to crush’ (PT *üŕ-, PM *hürü-, PTM *puru-, PK *pur-): PM *(h)ür-te-sü- ‘rags’, PTM *pur-te- ‘crumbs’ PA *s[ú]ŋu ‘to sink’ (PT *siŋ-, PM *siŋge- ~ *siŋgu-): PTM *suŋ-ta ‘deep’, PJ *sín-tú-m
PA *luko ‘wild pig’ (PTM *luke ‘boar’): PM *nog-tu-mal ‘wild male boar’, PTM *luk-te ‘wild boar’ However, because of lack of Mongolian data or because of a neutralized -č- reflex in Mongolian, PA *-t ̔- is in very many cases impossible to distinguish from *-t-, cf.: PA *bli ‘arm muscles’ (PTM *bola- ‘cuff’, PK *pằrh ‘arm’): PT *b(i)al-tɨ-r ‘calf of leg’, PM *bul-či- ‘muscles of arms and legs’, PJ *pín-tì ‘elbow’ PA *kăp ̔è ‘to squeeze, press together’ (PT *Kɨp- ‘to press together’, PTM *kap ‘together’): PT *Kɨp-tu ‘scissors’, PM *kaji-či id. PA *kēńa ‘elbow, angle’ (PM *ka(j) ‘front legs’, PJ *kana-i ‘rule, gusset’): PT *Kiajna-t ‘wing’, PT *keńe-tu ‘shin; stockings’



CHAPTER FOUR 183
PA *t ̔ékù ‘become thick (of liquids)’ (PK *tōi-, PJ *túka-): PTM *tek-ti, PK *tùthb
PA *zìŋke ‘light, quiet’ (PM *siŋge-n): PTM *siŋku-ti, PJ *sìntúka- ( < *sìnkú-ta-)
And there is further a functionally quite similar PA nominal suffix *-kt ̔-, which is clearly seen in the following examples: PA *úmu ‘a k. of fruit or berry’ (PJ *úmá- ‘plum’): OT imi-ti (ɨmɨ-t) ‘a k. of hawthorn’, PTM *uma-kta ‘brier, cornel’ PA *kumi ‘eyebrows, hair on temples’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PM *kömü-ske ‘eyebrow’): PTM *kumi-kte ‘eyelid’, PK *kùmì-t ‘hair on temples’ PA *kure ‘woodcock, woodpecker’ (PM *kur) : PT *Kör-tük, PTM *küre-kte.
PA *k ̔re ‘a k. of insect’ (cf. PK *kằr-kmi ‘a k. of spider’): PM *küri-d ‘moth larva’, PTM *xīrü-kte ‘ant’ PA *k ̔rú ‘bark, shell’ (PM *körü-sü ‘bark’, PK *kúr ‘shell, oyster’): PT *Kɨr-tɨ-ĺ ‘bark, surface’, PTM *xura-kta ‘bark’ Benzing 72 regards this PTM *-kta as collective; it is interesting to note that it is paralleled by verbal iterative *-kta- (see Benzing 119). The latter usage, however, seems to be absent outside Tungusic. In many of the cases listed above it could be in fact also possible to reconstruct *-kt‘-: Ud. bog-do-lo may go back to PTM *bogo-kta-, Evn. ewu-t-le to PTM *xebu-kte-, PTM *luk-te can be a crasis of *luku-kte and *suŋ-ta, of *suŋu-kta. This will leave us with only *lap-ta- and *pur-te- as reflexes of “adjectival” *-t ̔-. No matter how we shall explain these two examples, it seems quite possible that no PA “adjectival” *t ̔ existed, while all such cases should be explained as reflecting PA *-kt ̔-. We can add a number of other examples: PA *č ̔k ̔o ‘pivot, bolt’ (PTM *čiKi): PM *čig-ta ‘lock, bolt’, PK *čí-tó-ri ‘pivot, hinge’ PA *k ̔ằkú ‘doll’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PT *KAgu-r, PTM *xaku-kan): PK *koāŋ-tai, PJ *kùnkù-tú
PA *sgi ‘a k. of foliate tree’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PM *siɣe-r ‘nut tree’): PT *segü-t, PTM *siak-ta (like *lukte, most probably a crasis < *siagV-kta)
PA *sagu ‘a k. of vessel’ (PT *sagu): PT *sAgu-t, PK *sòth. Note that in a few cases when this suffix was preceded by a consonant cluster, Korean and Mongolian reveal different reflexes (losing the second element -t ̔- instead):

PA *ńam(ń)e ‘a k. of tree’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PT *jɨmu-rt, PM *ǯimu-ɣu-): PTM *ńamńi-kta, PK *nàmò-k, PJ *mmìti
PA *sirp ̔a ‘thick hair, bristle’ (PM *serbe ‘crest, bristle’): PT *sɨrt ‘bristle’, PM *sir-ke-g id., PTM *sirpa-kta id.
To sum up this rather difficult topic of dental suffixes in Proto-Altaic, the original situation emerges as follows: 1. adjectival/adverbial denominative *-d-, *-t- and *-kt ̔2. intransitive (passive?) deverbative *-t3. transitive and motional denominative/deverbative *-t ̔It should also be borne in mind that PT *-t and Mong. *-d can in some cases actually reflect the original plural suffix *-t ̔V (reflected also in PTM as *-ta, in Korean as *-tɨ-r and in Japanese as *ta-ti). The suffix *-kt ̔- in fact may be characterized broadly as “collective” (this is how Benzing 72 qualifies the PTM *-kta) and perhaps containing this very suffix (PA plural *-t ̔V).
4.1.7. PA *-n
As noticed in EAS 2 (pp. 168-169, 220-223) this suffix occurs in two functions:
1. as a deverbative with intransitive (reflexive) usage, cf.: PA *pi ‘to enjoy, rest’ (PTM *ā(b)- ‘to sleep’): PT *(i)abɨ-n- ‘to enjoy oneself’, PTM *ābun- ‘to entertain’ PA *m[ù]k ̔è ‘to suck’ (PT *bök- ‘be satiated’, PM *meke- ‘female breast, to suck’, PK *mk- ‘to eat’): PTM *muKu-n- ‘fill mouth with liquid’, PJ *màkà-nà-p- ‘to feed’ PA *pḗk ̔ò ‘to contrive, think of’ (PM *baka- ‘to covet, wish’): PT *bken‘to appreciate’, Ul. peken- ‘be embarrassed’ PA *saru ‘be worn out, torn’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PJ *suta-r-): PT *sara-n, PM *sar-n-i
It should be mentioned that in Japanese this suffix occurs only within the compound -na-p- (besides maka-nap- cf. also soko-nap- ‘to harm’ < *sk ̔o; ura-nap- ‘to divine’ (ura ‘divination’, *rú); usi-nap- ‘lose’ < *ču; noga-nap- ‘to pass’ < *nk ̔é etc.), and because of this -p- (originally causative, see above) has acquired rather a transitive usage. On the usage of this suffix as (re)iterative *-na- in TM see Benzing 120. The derivatives in *-n- in PA could also have a nominal usage (like OT tütü-n ‘smoke’, PTM *xebī-n ‘play’ etc., see Benzing 58, Gabain 73 etc.), but this seems to be a secondary nominalization.



CHAPTER FOUR 185
2. as a denominative with a rather loose semantics, frequently in a) body parts: PA *bk ̔a ‘thigh’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PM *boka-ɣur ‘behind, buttocks’) : PT *bɨkɨ-n ‘thigh’, PTM *bōKa-n id. PA *bkà ‘rib, breast bone’ (PJ *bàkì ‘side of body’): PT *boka-na ‘false ribs’, PM *bogo-ni ‘first rib’ PA *č ̔ăǯV ‘cheek, cheekbone’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PM *ǯaǯi-ɣur ‘part of cheek’, *ǯaǯi-la- ‘to chew’): PT *čAj-na- ‘to chew; jaw, cheek’, Man. ǯaǯi-n ‘cheekbone’ PA *kòt ̔e ‘hole’ (PT *göt ‘anus, buttocks’, PK *kút ‘hole’): PT *göte-n(e) ‘stomach’, Evn. qotańa ‘concave, cavity’ PA *seŋa ‘fringe, hair lock’ (not attested suffixless, cf.

PM *görü-ɣe-): PTM *gur-na- ‘squirrel, ermine’, PK *kòrá-ní ‘deer’ PA *k ̔uŕe ‘a k. of furry animal’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PT *xur-ka- / *xur-ga- ‘bear’): PT *Küŕe-n ‘ferret, weasel’, PM *küre-ne id. PA *sĭgò ‘deer, horned animal’ (PJ *sika): PT *sɨgu-n, PM *seɣe-n-ek PA *ebVrV ‘worm, snake’ (PTM *ūre): PT *ebre-n, Ul. were-n. c) plant names: PA *buk ̔e ‘vessel; gourd’ (Kor. pak): Evk. buku-n ‘birch bark put into cradle’, PK *pàkòní ‘bamboo basket’ PA *dŭlgu ‘a k. of foliate tree’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PTM *dulgi-kta ‘alder’): PT *jɨlgu-n ‘tamarisk’, PM *doluga-na ‘hawthorn’
PA *tagù ‘root’ (PTM *daga): PT *TAg-na, PM *deg-ne-/*dag-na-, PJ *tuku-nai
d) but also not infrequent in other semantic groups: PA *báku ‘pole, pillar’ (PK *pò ‘beam’): PT *bak-na ‘rung of a ladder’, PM *baga-na ‘central pole’ PA *emo ‘front’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PT *öm-ge-n ‘upper part of breast’): PM *emü-ne ‘front, South’, PTM *ume-n ‘one’ PA *t ̔udu ‘a period of time’ (PM *tuǯi ‘always’): PT *Tɨdɨ-n ‘time, appointed time’, PJ *tùnâ- ‘longlasting, always’) PA *lébù ‘swamp’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PM *lab-ku, PK *nɨp-h): PTM *lebē-n-, PJ *númà ( < *núbà-n-)

PA *moju ‘all, whole’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PTM *muja-kin): PK *mắi-n, PJ *múi-na
PA *nlpá ‘tin, lead’ (not attested suffixless): PTM *ńālba-n ‘tin’, PJ *nàpá-n(r)i > *nàmári
PA *ńàŕì ‘man, young man’ (PTM *ń(i)ari): PT *jeŕ-ne ‘son-in-law’, PK *nắr-ná- ‘brave’. PA *p ̔árà ‘cross-beam, constructing piece’ (PJ *párì): PT *ara-n, PM *(h)aran-ga, PTM *para-n
PA *p ̔là ‘field, level ground’ (PJ *pàrà): PT *ala-n, PTM *pāla-n PA *p ̔àlk ̔i ‘lightning, thunder’ (PT *jAlkɨ-, PTM *pialki-): PT *jAlkɨ-n, PTM *pialki-n- (perhaps also PK *pnkái < *plkán-?) PA *sebV ‘strange, supernatural’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PM *sebe-ɣün, PTM *sebe-ki): PTM *sebe-n, PK *sòn
PA *sgu ‘sun; sky’ (PK *hắi ‘sun’): PTM *sigū-n ‘sun’, PK *hànă-r ‘sky’ (also PJ *suà-rá < *suàn-rá)
The original function of this *-n- is not quite clear (unlike Ramstedt, we do not compare it with the TM diminutive in *-ńa, both for phonetic reasons and because of the lack of direct lexical matches). But this suffix has become extremely productive in Mongolian and TM (in the shape of final -n; on its further verbalization as -n-a- in TM see Benzing 116) and can be qualified as a general nominal determinative. It can perhaps be compared with the nominative -no, very frequent in Old Japanese. Since in Mongolian and Turkic words in -n lose it before the plural -d (-t), its original function may have been “singulative”, i.e. specifically expressing the singular number of a noun. The suffix *-n- can sometimes occur in conjunction with other suffixes, cf. cases like: PA *k ̔úrgo ‘intestine, belly’ (PK *kùri ‘stomach’): PT *Kurg-sa-k ‘belly, stomach’, PTM *xurke-n-se ‘belly (of fish)’ A “collective” suffix in -n- is sometimes observed in TM (see Benzing 73, based on Menges 1952), but it is basically found in complex formations like *-na-r, *-n-il or *-na-sal where the original “collective” meaning is actually expressed by other morphemes, so that the “collective” function of PA *-n- is extremely dubious.
4.1.8. PA *-l
The suffixed *-l- is very widely spread in all Altaic languages (although in Korean and Japanese it has, for obvious phonetic reasons, merged with *-r-), both by itself and in combination with other suffixes. Two basic functions of *-l- can be established.



CHAPTER FOUR 187
a) a deverbative nominal suffix, as in: PA *nắŋe ‘to curse, swear’ (PTM *niŋī- ‘to curse’): PT *jAŋɨ-l ‘mistake, fault’, PM *niɣü-l ‘sin’, Sol. niŋī-l ‘curse’. The derived noun in *-l- can be an abstract noun (as in the above example), but very frequently also an attributive (participial) noun, like in: PA *se ‘to be bad, guilty’ (PM *ösi ‘revenge, hate’, PTM *usa ‘bad’, *usē‘be sick, unable’): PT *osa-l ‘careless, dilatory’, MMong. ösü-l ‘revenge, hate’, PJ *s-r- ‘to be scared, afraid’ The verbal meaning of -r- in PJ *s-r- reflects further verbalization of the nominal stem in *-l-, which is observed in a great number of cases and was obviously present already in Common Altaic. The precise semantic definition of PA *-l- is rather difficult. In Turkic, it is involved in forming the passive voice in -l- (as well as, of course, deverbative nouns and verbs in -la-/-le-); in TM, it participates in building inchoatives (duku-l- ‘start to write’, see Benzing 120); in Mongolian, it is rather transitive (qaɣa-l- ‘split, divide’ as opposed to qaɣa-ra- ‘be split, divided’). The possible starting point here could be a transitive participle, with a secondary development into passive in Turkic (which is still to be explained, and is probably the result of completely restructuring old voice categories in Turkic). See the discussion of the *-l-suffix in Ramstedt 1912. Cf. the following cross-language matches: PA *čĭŋV ‘to listen, consider’ (not attested suffixless; with different suffixes cf. PTM *ǯiŋi-re- ‘to understand’, *ǯiŋ-k-si- ‘attentive’): PT *dɨŋ-la- / *diŋ-le- ‘to listen, hear’, PM *čiŋ-la- ‘to listen’ PA *č ̔amo ‘to suffer hardships’ (PT *čAm ‘fine, claim’): PT *čAm-la- ‘to be insulted, angry at’, PM *čima-la- ‘to be dissatisfied’, Neg. čamu-lị‘to be unwilling to share’, Jpn. tamar- ‘to endure’. PA *ka ‘bad, weak’ (PTM *eke- ‘to decrease; evil’, PJ *àk- ‘to be bored, satiated’): OT egi-l ‘common, ordinary’, PM *(h)ege-l ‘low, uneducated, not very good’, Nan. exe-le ‘bad, low’ PA *ēŋV ‘to think, understand’ (PT *āŋ ‘intelligence’): PT *āŋ-la- ‘to understand’, Evn. eŋē-li- ‘to peer, investigate’ PA *g(j)t ̔ì ‘to go, come’ (PT *gē(j)t- ‘to go’): PM *getü-l- / *gatu-l- ‘to cross over’, PJ *kítá-r- ‘to come, arrive’ PA *gḕnŋa ‘to bend’ (suffixless perhaps in Man. gen ‘horse’s counter’): PM *gana-l-ǯa- ‘to be bent’, PTM *gē(n)ŋe-l- id. PA *č ̔ĭk ̔a ‘to rise, sprout’ (PT *čɨk- ‘to go out, come out’, PM *čiki‘sprout’, PK *čhí- ‘to rise, raise’): PM *čiki-le- ‘to sprout’, Evk. čiki-l-tu- id.

This suffix is often combined with following velar suffixes, as in: PA *k ̔óŕa ‘a k. of tree with red berries or red bark’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PTM *(x)or-b-, *(x)or-aŋ-): PT *Kaŕɨ-l-gan / *Kar-lɨ-ga-n ‘currant’, PM *kar-gi-l ‘viburnum’, PJ *kátú-rá ‘Cereidiphyllum japonicum’ PA *k ̔àp ̔e ‘a k. of insect, butterfly’ (PM *kibe ‘moth’): PT *kepe-lek ‘butterfly’, PJ *kprnkí ‘cricket’ PA *lemV ‘meat, fat (of animals)’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PT *jamɨ-ŕ, *jam-du ‘groin; pubic hair’): PM *lami-l-ka-j ‘meat on sheep’s rump’, PTM *lemu-k ‘fat (under the skin of animals)’ Such suffix combinations have become quite productive in Mongolian (*-lga-) and especially in Turkic (*-lɨk, *-lɨg). It seems in fact possible to unite both usages of PA *-l-, by assigning it a general original attributive (denominative or deverbative) meaning. But we must stress that only with the latter meaning did the suffix become a part of the Common Altaic inflectional paradigm. In some daughter branches it has penetrated the nominal paradigm as well (cf. the Mong. comitative in -luɣa, generally after verbal nouns, and the TM nominal affixes as -l-un, -l-ken - see EAS 2, 40-43), but this seems to be a later development.
4.1. 9. PA *-r
PA *-r- appears to be even more frequent than *-l-. In Turkic, it is the general aorist suffix, used both as a finite form and as a participle. In this function it is compared (in EAS 2, pp. 87-89) with the Mong. supinum in -ra and the “preparative converb” in -ru-n, as well as with the participia futuri in TM and Korean. Its quite probable Japanese match is the general attributive -ru in the verbal paradigm. When it comes to derivation, one should note that in Mongolian, -ra-/-re- is basically an intransitive verbal suffix, as opposed to -l(a)-, see EAS 2, 194, 199 (see also above). If this is indeed the same mor



CHAPTER FOUR 191
pheme, then we might be able to reconstruct the Common Altaic verbal opposition *-l- ‘transitive participle’ : *-r- ‘intransitive participle’, subsequently passing into the domain of word-derivation. We can also note the usage of -r- as an intransitive morpheme in Old Japanese (which expanded later and led to the formation of the present-day passive in -r-), as well as the reflexive usage of -r- in Korean; since, however, these languages merged *-l- and *-r-, the origin of these inflectional morphemes cannot be firmly established. Ramstedt (1912, 32-37) characterizes PA *-r(a)- as ‘verbum neutrale oder inchoativum’. It seems, however, important to stress the modal function of -r- as an inflectional morpheme (meaning “in order to”, “necessary to” in Mong., TM and Korean), which seems to be lacking in case of *-r- as a derivational suffix. But one should be cautious while reconstructing PA *-r-. It should be borne in mind that the only group preserving the original distinction *-r- : *-ŕ- is Turkic, and Turkic has a quite different - causative *-ŕ-suffix, also corresponding to -r- in other Altaic languages. The situation is further complicated by an alternation -ŕ- / -r- within Turkic (“Helimski’s rule”), due to which *-ŕ- becomes *-r- in a postconsonantal prevocalic position (so that *CVC-ŕV- > *CVC-rV-). Therefore, some of the following matches with an apparently transitive usage of *-r- may in fact reflect PA *-ŕ-, on which see below. PA *èbà ‘join, meet’ (PJ *àp-): PTM *ebu-re- ‘join, meet’, PK *àbór- ‘join’ PA *ắk ̔è ‘to advance gradually, slowly’ (PM *(h)aki-): PT *aku-ru‘slowly’; PJ *kú-rá- ‘to be, come late’ PA *àpo ‘to wear out, be spoiled’ (PJ *àpà- ‘weak, faded’): PT *obu-ra- ‘to wear out, decay’, PM *ebe-re- ‘to weaken’ PA *bdé ‘to jump, trot’ (PT *büdi- ‘to dance, jib’, PK *ptùi- ‘to jump’): PM *büdü-ri- ‘to stumble’, Nan. budu-ri- ‘to hurry’, PJ *bnt-r- ‘to jump’ PA *bĺa ‘confusion, fright’ (PT *būĺ- ‘to be bad-tempered, irritable’): PT *būĺ-ur-ga- ‘to be worried, confused’, PJ *bású-rá- ‘to forget’ PA *bŋe ‘to howl’ (PTM *būni-): PT *böŋ-re-, PM *büɣü-rePA *č ̔ukV ‘to jump, trot’ (PM *čogi-; PK *čhú- ‘to dance’): Bur. sojo-r-, Evk. čuke-rē

PA *-r- also functions as a denominative suffix, forming adjectives (sometimes, as usual, with further nominalization or verbalization). It is probably quite different in origin from the verbal *-r- and must have had an original meaning ‘pertaining to’ or ‘located in the region of’, whence the well known usage of *-r- as a locative suffix in Turkic, Mongolian and Korean, see EAS 2, 38-39.

PA *sŕi ‘to flow, drip’ (PT *süŕ-, PTM *sir-): PM *sür-či-, PJ *sìtà-tRamstedt (1912, 29-32) regards the suffix -č(a)- in Mong. as ‘reciprocal’ and corresponding to PT *-ĺ(č)-, but the actual evidence does not appear to support this point of view. In cases like PM *mun-ča ‘mallet’ or PT *ök-če ‘heel’, we see this suffix functioning already as a nomen instrumenti, and similar cases are: PA *làk ̔ù ‘to bend, hang’ (PM *naki- ‘to bend’, TM *laxu- ‘to hang’, PJ *nuki ‘cross-beam’): Evk. laku-ča ‘loop’, PK *nák-s ‘hook’ PA *krV ‘to cut out, sharp’ (PTM *kōri- ‘to delve, carve out’): PT *Kur-č ‘sharp, hard (of steel)’, PM *kur-ča ‘sharp’ (probably originally ‘cutting instrument’ > ‘sharp’) In TM the suffix *-č- with this function can become further verbalized (“to treat with...”, like Nan. okto-či- ‘to treat with herbs, medicines’ etc., see Benzing 116).
4.1.11. PA *-ǯ
1. Nominal The suffix *-ǯ- is well preserved in TM languages, basically as an adjective suffix (*-g-ǯ-: *sēg-ǯe- ‘red’, *sō-g-ǯa- ‘yellow’, *ĺog-ǯa- ‘green, dark’, *šāk-ǯa- ‘white’, *(x)ig-ǯa ‘grey, yellow’, *xur(i)-gǯa ‘grey’, *kuku-gǯa ‘blue’), but also in other cases (*gul-ǯa ‘hearth’, *seg-ǯe- ‘wild deer’, *saji-ǯa ‘sieve’ etc.) . Mong. has a number of nouns in -ǯ-, mostly with preceding -l- (*bagal-ǯa-ɣur ‘throat’, gal-ǯa-ɣur ‘wild, rabid’,



CHAPTER FOUR 199
*haji-ǯa-ɣan ‘ship’, *uga-lǯa ‘male mountain goat’, *kija-ǯa ‘sedge’, *kubi-lǯa ‘tick’, *simi-lǯe ‘a k. of bird of prey’; *guran-ǯu ‘whetstone’, *an-ǯu ‘fine’ etc.). In Turkic and Japanese one would expect a *-j-, and indeed there exists an adjectival *-ja-ka (OJ niko-ja-ka ‘mild’, suku-ja-ka ‘healthy’ etc.). In several cases this suffix can be traced to Common Altaic: PA *sḕgù ‘health, blood’ (PT *sạg ‘healthy’): PTM *sēg-ǯe- ‘red’, PJ *sùkù-ja-ka- ‘healthy’. PA *ńabĺu ‘to be born, child’ (PJ *mus-): PM *ǯul-ǯa-gan, PTM *ńab(ul)-ǯa PA *k ̔ĺú ‘a small wild animal’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PJ *kùsá-(m)pú, PT *Küĺü-l): PM *kerel-ǯe-gene, PTM *xelde-gǯe ( ~ -gde).
In Turkic, however, the situation is complicated. No cases of a *-j- : *-ǯ- correspondence in suffixed morphemes have been attested; there is, however, a number of cases when Turkic has an unexpected -č-: PA *ni ‘to hold, present’ (TM *anī- ‘to present a gift’, PK *ān- ‘to hold in the arms’): PT *ēn-čü ‘gift, fief’, PM *an-ǯu ‘fine’ PA *ìbè ‘door, yard’ (PT *eb ‘house’, PK *íp ‘door’): PT *eb-či ‘housewife, woman’, PTM *ib-ǯe ‘relative-in-law’ The last case suggests that the very widely attested PT suffix of nomina agentis *-či may in fact go back to PA *-ǯ-; but more evidence would be needed to make it a certainty. The original function of PA *-ǯ- remains not quite clear: it can be characterized broadly as “adjectival” (Benzing 60 qualifies PTM *-ǯ(u) as diminutive, which is not at all secure). 2. Verbal We find a similar, but quite isolated case of Turk. -č-: Mong. -ǯ- in: PA *kìkú ‘to bite; rub, scrape’ (PT *Kik- ‘to rub, grind’, PTM *kik- ‘to bite’): OT kik-čü-r- ‘to rub, grind (at each other)’, PM *keg-ǯe- ‘to scrape off, incise’. This may be a secondary (assimilative?) development in Mong. of the PA intensifying *-č ̔-, on which see above. There is, however, evidence for a PA verbal *-ǯ- as well. In TM, the suffix -ǯ- occurs as an intransitive (or, perhaps, reflexive / medial, in the sense of doing smth. for or by oneself), cf. *deg-ǯe- ‘burn’, *sine-ǯi‘be poor, distressed’, *seb-ǯe-n- ‘to have fun’, *gob-ǯa- ‘to hunt’ etc. (there is also a *-ǯa-, marking imperfective or durative aspect, see Benzing 118, but it is not completely clear whether it is the same morpheme). It again has a quite probable direct match in PJ *-ja-, the standard Old Japanese passive suffix. In Mong. we only find verbal -ǯ- in combination with a preceding -l-: *aɣu-lǯa- ‘to meet’, *taji-tu-lǯa- ‘drag one’s feet’, *koru-lǯa- ‘whirl’,

*naji-lǯa- ‘shake, sway’, *melme-lǯe- ‘become full’, *gurba-lǯa- ‘move creeping’, *delbe-lǯe- / *dalba-lǯa- ‘shake, sway’, bol-ǯa- ‘agree upon time’, dürbe-lǯe- ‘to blaze, flame’, *gana-lǯa- ‘be bent’ etc. In Turkic, this -lǯ- would normally correspond to *-ĺ(č)-, and we indeed find Turkic *-ĺ(č) as an intransitive (reflexive) suffix; but it seems mainly to correspond to Mongolian *-ld- in the same function, so that the Turkic evidence remains uncertain. To sum up: Proto-Altaic probably had an intransitive (medial?) verbal suffix *-ǯ-, preserved in PTM as *-ǯ-, in Japanese - as -j- and in Mongolian as -ǯ- (with an addition of -l-, probably on analogy with the similar -ld-suffix). The absence of direct lexical matches with this suffix suggests, however, that it could have been not a derivational, but a purely inflectional morpheme, which it has remained in Japanese: indeed, the perfectly possible OJ passive jaka-ja- ‘to be burnt’ is in fact a precise match of PTM *deg-ǯe-.
4.1.12. PA *-ń
A diminutive in *-ńa exists in TM (see EAS 2, 220), and a possible case of *-ń- in PA could be: PA *t ̔p ̔o ‘nail, hoof’ (PTM *tüpa): PT *tub-ńa-k (with a different suffix order = PTM *tüp-ken < *tüp-ke-ń?), PJ *túmá-i.
The evidence for this suffix is, however, extremely limited, and its existence in PA is dubious (the actual form underlying PT *tub-ńa-k could be, e.g., *tup-ni-gak or the like).
4.1.13. PA *-ĺ
A verbal reciprocal suffix *-ĺ(č)- is widely represented in Turkic. It has its closest match in Mongolian -ld- and TM *-ld- (see Benzing 121) with the same meaning, which is historically a combination of *-ĺ- with the intransitive/passive *-t- (on which see above). The question remains open whether Turkic *-ĺ(č)- reflects just *-ĺ- or a similar combination *-ĺd- or *-ĺt-, which would phonetically yield the same result. However, available TM parallels show just -l- here, and there are also archaic cases of reciprocal -l- (without -d-) in Mongolian, so that PA reciprocal *-ĺ- can be safely reconstructed. Direct lexical comparisons for forms incorporating *-ĺ- with Korean and Japanese are not numerous (just as in case with *-ǯ-, because the morpheme was originally not just derivational but rather inflectional), but they seem to show standard reflexes (*-r- in Korean, *-s- in Japanese). This -s- in Japanese is, however, very difficult to distinguish



CHAPTER FOUR 201
from the reflex of PA *-s- (see below), with which it of course completely merged; it is probable, however, that Jpn. -s- goes back to *-ĺ- in the following direct lexical matches: PA *ṓč ̔é ‘bad, anger’ (PT *ȫč ‘revenge, anger’, PJ *nt- ‘to fear’): PT *ȫče-ĺ(č)- ‘to take revenge’, MMong. öče-ldü- ‘id., be inimical’, PJ *nt-s- ‘to intimidate’ PA *kéro ‘to fight, kill’ (PM *kere- ‘to quarrel, fight’, PK *kūr- ‘to curse, deprecate’, PJ *kr- ‘to curse’): PT *gErü-ĺ(č)- ‘to quarrel, fight’, PM *kere-l-dü- id., Man. keru-le- ‘to fine’, PJ *kr-s- ‘to kill’ PA *t ̔ḕbà ‘to run’ (PTM *tēb- with different suffixes): PT *tabɨ-ĺ-, PM *taw-li-, PJ *tapa-si-r
The original meaning of *nts- and *krs- in Japanese must have been “fear each other > intimidate” and “fight with each other > kill”. The reciprocal meaning was lost after PA reciprocal *-ĺ- merged with the general causative -s- in Japanese (note, however, that *krs- within Japanese cannot be explained as a causative from *kr- ‘curse’, so that only the Altaic etymology provides an explanation of this form’s structure). Further examples of direct lexical matches involving PA *-ĺ- are: PA *ădV ‘to fit, be equal’ (PTM *ada-): PT *ădaĺ ‘friend, companion’; PM *adali ‘equal, similar’ PA *bĕŕa ‘peace’ (PT *bAŕ ‘peace’, PTM *bere ‘peaceful’): PT *bar-ɨĺ(č)- ‘to establish peace’, PM *bere-le- ‘to be shy; to do a favour’ PA *čŏge ‘to give, exchange’ (PT *dẹg- ‘to cost, be worth’, PM *düji- ‘to buy or sell wholesale’, PK *čú- ‘to give’, PJ *tai ‘goods for exchange’): PT *dẹgi-ĺ(č)- ‘to change, exchange’, PTM *ǯugē-l- ‘to exchange’ PA *kāmV ‘to be weak, oppress’ (PT *KĀma- ‘to become blinded, dumb; to set teeth on edge’, PM *kama- ‘to be mangy’, PTM *kama- ‘to oppress’): PT *KĀma-ĺ(č)- id., PTM *kama-li- ‘to oppress’ PA *k ̔no ‘match, other side’ (PM *kani ‘friend, mate’): PT *Konu-ĺ(č) ‘friend’, MMong. qani-l-qa- ‘to compare’ PA *ṓk ̔è ‘to put, heap; to give’ (PT *ȫk-, PM *ök-, PJ *k-): PT *ȫkü-ĺ ‘many’ (*’put together’), Kor. ugɨ-l - ugɨ-l -ha- ‘to congregate, be numerous’ PA *kàdi ‘seam, to sew, lace’ (PT *K(i)adɨ-, PM *kaǯi-, PK *kjd-): PT *K(i)adɨ-ĺ ‘leather belt’ (*’sewn together’), Evk. kelē- ‘to lace, befringe’ PA *p ̔áru ‘to spin, plait, wrap’ (PT *ar-, PTM *por-): PT *arɨ-ĺ ‘woven stuff’ (*’woven together’) , PTM *porV-l- ‘to spin, turn round’



INTRODUCTION
202
There also seems to have existed a nominal (diminutive? attributive?) *-ĺ-. It occurs in several nouns with a hardly definable semantic sphere, but also, probably significantly, in a number of words denoting plant world, cf.: PA *kuma ‘a blood-sucking insect’ (PTM *küme ‘flea, gnat’): PT *Kum-ĺu-j ‘louse, tick’, PK *kmrí ‘leech’ PA *p ̔ărV ‘thill’ (PTM *para): PT *arɨ-ĺ, PM ((h)ara-l. PA *gure ‘flour’ (PK *kằrằ): PT *gürü-ĺ(č), PM *guri-l PA *lēmo ‘fresh, raw’ (PJ *nàmâ): PT *jmi-ĺ-č ‘vegetables’, PK *nằmằ-rh id. PA *mĕlu ‘a k. of berry’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PTM *m[e]li-kte): PT *bele-ĺ(č) ‘rowan’, PM *moji-l-(su)- ‘bird-cherry’ PA *malu ‘a k. of evergreen tree’ (PJ *murua ‘juniper’): PT *bAla-ĺ(č) ‘fir tree’, PM *maji-la-su ‘cypress’ Just as in the case with *-ŕ- (see below), however, it cannot be excluded that Turkic *-ĺ- in these cases actually reflects a combination *-l-s- and we are actually dealing with the reflexes of plain *-l- here: cf. the two very suspicious (in this respect) Turko-Mongolian matches: *bele-ĺ(č) - *mojil-su- and *bAla-ĺ(č) : *majila-su.
4.1.14. PA *-ŕ
The evidence of Turkic, where *-ŕ- is a well known causative morpheme, suggests that PA *-ŕ- was a transitive (causative) marker, and identical in this function to Mong. -r-, -ri- and the transitive -r- occurring in TM and Korean (see Ramstedt 1912, 23-29, with some confusion of *-ŕ- and *-r-; EAS 2, 176-177). The situation, however, is rather complicated by the facts that only Turkic distinguishes between *-ŕ- and *-r-, that Turkic *-ŕ- sometimes also appears as *-r- (due to Helimski’s rule, see above; in such cases the causative therefore may also have the shape of -r-), and that PA *-r- by itself was rather an intransitive marker (see above), so finding direct matches for PT *-ŕ- is rather difficult. The same morpheme is used in Turkic for forming deverbative nouns (adjectives or action results), and following direct lexical comparisons may be quoted: PA *gt ̔ù ‘to deteriorate’ (PM *gutu- ‘to deteriorate’, PTM *gutu- ‘to rage, disgrace’, PJ *kutu- ‘to rot’): PT *Kūtu-ŕ ‘mad, enraged’, *Kūtu-r(a)- ‘to become mad, enraged’, PM *gutu-ra- ‘to deteriorate, become spoiled’



CHAPTER FOUR 203
PA *kúbé ‘to wish, hope, like’ (PM *köwü ~ *küwü ‘wish, profit’, Man. keo, keb ‘friendly, lovingly’, PJ *kuámp- ‘to flatter’): PT *gübe-ŕ ‘proud’, PM *köɣe-r (*köwe-r) ‘joy, happiness’, Evk. kuwe-r ‘bride’ PA *kàmo ‘to brew alcohol’ (PJ *kàm- ‘to brew sake’): PT *Kumɨ-ŕ ‘fermented milk’, PM *kimu-r(a-ɣa-) ‘fermented milk with water’ PA *keju ‘to boil’ (PK *kò’-): PT *Kā-ŕ-ga-n ‘kettle’, PM *kaji-ra- ‘to burn, roast’, *kajir-su- > *kaji-su- ‘kettle’, PTM *kej-re- id. PA *kṓk ̔à ‘to be deficient, damaged’ (PT *Kōk- ‘to decrease, diminish’, PM *koki- ‘to be damaged’, PJ *káká- ‘to be deficient’): PT *Kōku-ŕ ‘deficient, empty’, PM *koki-r ‘deficient, humble’, *koki-ra- ‘to become deficient’ PA *k ̔ăbo ‘to deceive, slander’ (PT *Kobu ‘slander’, PK *k- ‘lie, deceit’): OT qovuz ‘conjuration, exorcism’, PM *kaɣur- ‘to deceive’ Note that the intransitive meaning in cases like PM *gutu-ra- or *koki-ra- may be either due to the secondary influence of the intransitive -ra- (see above), or in fact reflect a different PA formation with an *-r-suffix. The following cases may in fact reflect PA *-ŕ-, although the Turkic reflex is absent or is transformed to -r- due to Helimski’s rule: PA *č ̔éč ̔í ‘to press, squeeze’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PJ *tíntí-ma-, *tíntí-k-): Man. čeče-re-, PK *čìčr-.
PA *dlp ̔i ‘to burst, break’ (PJ *timpə- ‘to become worn out’): PM *delbe-re- ‘to burst, break through’, Evk. delpe-r-ge- ‘to split’ PA *bè ‘to carry on the back’ (PTM *ebe-, PK *p-, PJ *p-): PM *eɣü-re-, Nan. ịwa-rị- ‘to unload’ PA *ĕbà ‘to winnow, fan’ (not attested suffixless, cf.

PA *sidu ‘to rub off, peel off’ (PTM *sidu-): PT *sɨdɨ-r- ( = *sɨd-r- < *sɨd-ŕ-), PM *sidu-r

PA *sép ̔à ‘to grip’ (PM *siɣü-, PK *spă-): PM *siɣü-re-, Man. sefe-re-, PJ *sápá-r
PA *t ̔ằkù ‘to repair’ (PTM *taku-): PT *Tag-ra- ( < *Tag-ŕa-), PJ *tùkùrPA *-ŕ- is also used as a denominative suffix, very similar in sphere to *-r- (see above), cf.: PA *gébó ‘shell, husk’ (PK *kòbi ‘bamboo bark’, PJ *kámpí ‘rice ear’): PT *Kạbɨ-ŕ ‘husk, shell’, PM *gaw-r-su ‘chaff, straw’ PA *goŋV ‘a k. of insect’ (PTM *guŋgu ‘big fly’): PT *Koŋu-ŕ ‘beetle’, PM *guwu-r ‘larva of a gad-fly’ PA *kŋi ‘hollow, empty’ (PK *kíń- ‘nest, to nest’): PT *geŋi-ŕ ‘nasal cavity’, Evk. keŋ-re ‘hole, ice-hole’ PA *kúmle ‘a k. of ungulate’ (PJ *kuáma ‘foal’): PT *Külmü-ŕ ‘male chamois’, Evk. kuma-ra-n ‘Siberian stag’ PA *óŋdu ‘a k. of small wild animal’ (PTM *oŋda, PJ *uni): PT *utɨŕ, Orok onnorị, PK *òńắrí.
PA *pédá ‘spot, ornament’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PTM *pede-ne- ‘to mark, dirty’): PT *bedi-ŕ, PM *bede-r, PJ *panta-ra PA *p ̔át ̔à ‘uncultivated land, field’ (PJ *pátà): PT *Atɨ-ŕ, PM *(h)ata-r PA *p ̔ŏk ̔i ‘ox, cow’ (not attested suffixless, cf. Evn. höken): PT *ökü-ŕ, PM *hüke-r, Evk. huku-r
PA *p ̔ŏŋe ‘mildew, slime’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PTM *puŋ-da [ or < *puŋ-ra?]): PT *öŋe-ŕ, PM *(h)öŋgü-r
PA *uge ‘river’ (PTM *ugē): PT *ügü-ŕ, PM *üje-r, Man. we-re-n, PK *jh-r, PJ *ùrà
The archaic nature of this *-ŕ- is dubious: it is not excluded that in these cases Turkic actually reflects a combination of the plain *-r-suffix with a subsequent -s- (cf. the match PT *Kạbɨ-ŕ = PM *gaw-r-su), which phonetically yielded *-ŕ.



CHAPTER FOUR 205
There are, however, several specific cases, where *-ŕ- occurs in words meaning ‘two’ or ‘pair’ and in some paired body parts: PA *kk ̔è ‘breast’ (PM *kökö-n, PTM *kuku-n): PT *gökü-ŕ ‘breast’, PJ *kkr ‘heart’ PA *mújŋi ‘horn’ (Evk. muŋi ‘tendon’): PT *bujŋu-ŕ ‘horn’, PM *möɣer‘cartilage’ PA *p ̔òk ̔e ‘pair, couple’ (PT *ẹki ‘two’, PJ *pká  ̔other’): PT *ẹki-ŕ, PM *(h)eki-re ‘twins’
PA *tubu ‘two’ (PTM *ǯube, PK *tū): PT *TVbVr ( ~ -ŕ), PM *ǯui-ri-n, PK *tū-rh
This may in fact be an archaic dual marker; whether it corresponds to the Japanese plural in -ra is not quite clear (the latter may be rather a match for the plural reflected in PT *la-r, PM *na-r and TM *-l).
4.1.15. PA *-j
In a number of nouns we encounter a final *-(a)j or *-e in Turkic, apparently corresponding to *-i in Mongolian and to a long final vowel (*-ī or *-ǖ) in TM (on the PTM “Koseform” -ī see Benzing 66), cf.: PA *ge ‘lonely’ (with different suffixes cf. PT *ögü-n, PK *ói-rằb-): PT *öge-j, PM *ügej, PTM *ugī.
PA *sgó ‘thick growth’: PM *sigu-j, PTM *sigǖ, PJ *sìnkàiPA *ačV ‘woman, elder female relative’: PT *ăčaj / *ĕčej, PTM *asī PA *t ̔ari ‘a k. of water bird’ (with a different suffix cf. PTM *tar-mī): PT *tara-ka-j, PM *čirü-ke-j
PA *t ̔ku ‘a horned animal’: PT *teke, PM *togij, PTM *tōKī PA *kúńe ‘moth, worm’: PT *güńe, PTM *kuńī-kta, PK *kńúi PA *mūko ‘snake’ (cf. PK *mək-, PJ *múká-tai): PT *böke, PM *mogaji, PTM *mǖkǖ PA *k ̔ge ‘palate, jaw’ (with different suffixes cf. PTM *xǖk-te, PJ *k(ù)i, PK *khú-m): PT *Kög-me, PM *köɣe-mej
PA *úmu ‘to bear, give birth’ (PTM *omu-/umu-, PK *ūm, PJ *úm-): PT *umaj ‘placenta’, PM *(h)umaji ‘womb’ On the basis of these matches it seems possible to reconstruct a common Altaic suffix *-j-, probably diminutive or expressive. One should also note that *-kī is a very widespread suffix in TM (see Benzing 66-67), and it seems to correspond to Mongolian *-kai, Turkic *-kaj with the same function. In many cases, though, the suffix is different to recover: in Turkic it tends to disappear after all vowels except *-a (and even in those cases is rather rare), while in Mongolian it is impossible to distinguish from original *-gi.



INTRODUCTION
206
From a few examples above it would seem that Japanese and Korean also may reflect this suffix as *-i. In fact, *-i is a very well-known suffix in the Korean-Japanese area (cf. Martin 1995, 142, Vovin 1997, 9), where it forms both deverbative nouns (Jpn. kak- ‘write’, kak-i ‘writing’, *anka- ‘raise’, *anka-i > age ‘raising’) and (in Japanese) often serves as a direct stem marker: *pə-i > OJ pi ‘fire’, in compounds pə- etc. However, this *-i seems rather to be a later addition. In the case of ‘fire’, e.g., this suffix was obviously added after the disappearance of the medial *-r(PJ *pə- ‘fire’ < *p ̔re+gV). It is perhaps more appropriate to regard it as a continuation of the PA demonstrative pronoun *i, serving as a nominative suffix (and indeed attested in this function both in Korean and Old Japanese). A verbal *-j- may have also existed, although it is difficult to find direct lexical matches, due to the very unstable phonetical nature of *-j-. Proto-Japanese has verbal stems in *CVCa-, *CVCu- and *CVCə-, but no stems in *CVCi-. One may suspect that Pre-Proto-Japanese stems in *-ihad lost their final vowel and thus gave rise to numerous verbal stems in *CVC-. At the same time, PJ has numerous alternations like *tuk- ‘be attached’ / *tuka- ‘attach’ or *dak- ‘burn’ / *daka- ‘be burnt’. They can thus be reconstructed for an earlier stage as *tuki- / *tuka-, *daki- / *daka-; *tuki- here could actually go back to *tuka-ji- (with a very early contraction > *tuki-, because it was not affected by the regular later Old Japanese development *ai > e), the suffix *-ji- acting as what Vovin 1997 calls ‘transitivity flipper’. The Altaic source of this *-ji- is, however, not quite clear. It may be related to the causative (or ‘transitivity flipper’) *-g- (on which see below), but the development *-g- > -j- here would require a special explanation, since normally it only occurs after diphthongs (or should one reconstruct *-jg- here?). Another possible solution would be to trace this PJ *-ji- to a PA suffix *-ji-, preserved in Mong. -ji- forming “verba status” (qumi- ‘to bind together’ : qumi-ji- ‘to be bound’; Ramstedt 1912, 56-58 derives them as well from PA *-gi-, which seems somewhat dubious).
4.1.16. PA *-s
1. A deverbative *-s- is attested in all branches of Altaic. In Turkic and Mongolian there is a desiderative -se- (both deverbative, like OT kel-se‘want to come’, and denominative, like OT suv-sa- ‘want water’ = ‘become thirsty’), see EAS 2, 187-188. Although Ramstedt separates this suffix (tracing it back to *se- ‘do, say’ - a rather dubious derivation) from -s- in cases like Mong. ölü-s- ‘become hungry’ or Nan. puli-si



CHAPTER FOUR 207
‘walk’, they seem to be essentially the same affix with an original desiderative or inchoative meaning (‘want to...’ or ‘begin to...’), and as such probably identical to the optative in -s-, widely attested in Turkic, Mongolian, TM and Korean (see EAS 2, 84-85). In Korean and Japanese the same -s- is used (since the oldest written texts) as a marker of politeness (see Vovin 1997, 9), also a quite understandable semantic development from an original desiderative. Japanese is unique in having this morpheme functioning as a transitive (in pairs like kuda-r- ‘to be lowered’ : kuda-s- ‘to lower’). This may be a result of several morphological and phonological developments: a) a fusion of the verbal stem with the separate verb *sV- ‘to do, make’, resulting in a general transitive/causative suffix formation; similar compounds with hă- are widely attested in Korean. The same formation may be reflected in TM as intensive / frequentative *-su- (*-si-), on which see Benzing 119. b) a development of *-ĺ- > -s- that led to the inclusion into this category of several old reciprocal formations (see above on *krs-, *nts-); c) in a few cases like PM *gudu-s ‘downward’ = PJ *kúntá-s- ‘to lower’ this -s- may have still another origin, going back to the PA directional suffix (see below)
The following cross-language matches can illustrate the PA deverbative (desiderative/inchoative) *-s-: PA *ắmo ‘mouth; taste’ (PT *um- ‘to hope for, desire’; PM *ama(n) ‘mouth’; PJ *ámá- ‘tasty, sweet’): PT *um-sa- ‘to hope for, long’, PM *am-sa- ‘to taste’, PK *má-s ‘taste’ (PA *ắmo-s- ‘want to taste’) PA *bke ‘to lie in ambush’ (PT *buk-, Kalm. büg-): PM *büg-si- id., PJ *bká-s- ‘to attack, assault’ (PA *bke-s- ‘start lying in ambush, position oneself in ambush’) PA *ebí ‘to be weak, to wither’ (PK *bí- ‘to be exhausted, hungry’): PK *p-s- ‘to lack, be insufficient’, PJ *impu-sia- ‘in bad spirits’ (PA *ebí-s‘become exhausted, insufficient’) PA *èk ̔á ‘to paw, hit with hooves’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PTM *ek-te-, PJ *ànkà-k-): PT *ag-sa- ‘to hobble, limp’, PM *(h)ag-sa- ‘to have fits, convulsions’ (PA *èk ̔á-s- ‘start pawing’) PA *òpe ‘to cover, to wear’ (PM *ibe-, PJ *p-): PTM *up-si ‘clothes, belt’, PK *p-s- ‘to put on (hat)’ (PA *òpe-s- ‘get clothed’) PA *tp ̔é ‘wave, flap, fly’ (PM *debi-, PJ *tmp-): PM *debi-s-, PTM *dep-si- / *dap-si- (PA *tp ̔é-s- ‘start flying, soar up’) PA *t ̔ja ‘to float, slide’ (PT *tāj-, PTM *tia-): PM *te-si-, PTM *ti-sa- (PA *t ̔ja-s- ‘start sliding’)

208
PA *t ̔ŋe ‘admiration; condolence’ (PT *tāŋ): PT *taŋ-su-, PM *taŋ-si(PA *t ̔ŋe-s- ‘become admiring’) PA *t ̔ukì ‘to come to an end’ (PT *tüke-): Yak. tüksü, PM *tögü-s-, PJ *tuku-s- (PA *t ̔ukì-s- ‘become exhausted’) Note that the Japanese forms here (*bká-s- ‘attack’, *tuku-s- ‘exhaust’) synchronically contain the transitive marker -s-; historically, however, they match well PM *büg-si- and *tögü-s- and thus reflect PA *bke-s- ‘start lying in ambush’ and *t ̔uki-s- ‘start being exhausted’.
2. An adverbial directive suffix -s(i) is attested in Mongolian and Tungus (see EAS 2, 48-49), and this may have left a trace in some derived verbs, cf.: PA *gódú ‘down, to lower’ (PT *Kodɨ): PM *gudu-s ‘downward’, PJ *kúntá-s- ‘to lower’ PA *úgu ‘up, above’ (PT *jüg-, PM *öɣe-, PTM *ug-, PK *ù(h)): PT *jüg-se- ‘to rise’, PM *ög-se- id., PTM *ugV-si ‘above, up’; one is also tempted to add PJ *k-s- ‘to rise’, which may reflect a merger of this root with PA *ŋṑk ̔è ‘top, above’.
3. A “general-purpose” nominal suffix -s- is widely attested in Mongolian (usually as -su(n)) and TM (usually as -su- or -sa, often in a compound -k-sa), see EAS 2, 225-227, 239 (although separating the Mong. -su- and attempting, strangely enough, to derive the TM -su from Chinese shou ‘hand’; on the TM -su-/-sa- see Benzing 89). This suffix became quite obsolete in Turkic (although some traces of it after *-l- and *-r- may still be observable as *-ĺ- and *-ŕ-, see above), while in Japanese it may have been preserved as the finite form of adjectives (-si), frequently incorporated into the adjective stem as a derivational morpheme (utuku-si- ‘beautiful’ etc.). This suffix may in fact be nothing else than the pronominal *sV of the 3d person, preserved in Turkic as *-sɨ-, the pronominal suffix of the 3d person, and in Japanese as the demonstrative *sə / *si. This would explain its apparent disappearance in Turkic: the suffix has not disappeared at all, but preserved its original function, while in Mongolian and TM it was desemanticized. Benzing (69-70) regards PTM *-sa as a collective suffix, so in fact we may be dealing here both with a PA pronominal *-sV and collective *-sa, which are rather difficult to keep apart in individual cases. Some examples of this *-s- in cross-language matches: PA *č ̔ṑk ̔e ‘grass, weed’ (PTM *čūKa): PK *sok-săi, PJ *tùkúsi ‘horse-tail’ PA *k ̔àp ̔à ‘a k. of vessel, box’ (PJ *kàpì ‘scoop, ladle’): PT *KAp-sa-k ‘basket’, PTM *xap-sa ‘box’

PA *šuba ‘water’ (PT *sɨb, Man. so- ‘sprinkle’): PM *u-su, PTM *šobī-ksa; cf. also PT *sɨb-sɨ-, *sɨb-sa-, containing the verbal *-s-suffix (see above). In combinations with velar suffixes: PA *p ̔ḕtá ‘meat; skin’ (PT *et, PJ *pàntá, PTM *pētē): PM *(h)ada-ska, PTM *pētē-ske
PA *t ̔ŕe ‘leg, knee’ (PT *dīŕ, PK *tàrí): PT *tir-sge-k ‘elbow’, PTM *türē-kse ‘boot-top’
4.1.17. PA *-g
The suffix *-g- is known as a causative marker in TM (see Benzing 122), Mongolian and Korean (where it is reflected as -0-), see EAS 2, 170-175. It is, however, not attested at all in Turkic and Japanese. On the other hand, there is a number of Common Altaic verbal stems in *-g- which can rather be classified as intensive or factitive and are not necessarily causative (“do or undergo smth. repeatedly”), see Ramstedt 1912, 10-20. Cf.: PA *bójĺo ‘to learn, be attentive’ (also attested with the causative/passive *-b-, see above): PT *boĺ-gu- ‘to learn’, PM *bol-gu-(ɣa)‘to be cautious’, PK *pằi-hó- ‘to learn’ PA *èmi ‘to avoid, taboo’ (PJ *ìm-): PT *em-ge- ‘to suffer, be tortured’, PM *emi-ɣe- ‘to be timid, shy away’ PA *gṓŕV ‘to move, be irritated’ (Evk. gori- ‘to move, stir’): PT *Kōŕ-ga‘to be irritated, agitated’, PTM *gur-ge- ‘to move, stir’ PA *k ̔ēro ‘to shout, speak’ (PTM *xērī- ‘to shout, call’): PT *Kạr-ga- ‘to swear, curse’, PM *karija- / *karaɣa- id. PA *p ̔ĭru ‘pray, bless’ (PK *pīr-): Yak. ɨrā ( < *ɨra-ga), PM *hiru-ɣe-, PTM *piru-gē
PA *šŭŕu ‘leak, ooze’ (PT *sɨŕ-): PM *sir-gü-, PTM *šur-gīPA *t ̔ḗlù ‘string, spreader’ (PT *tēl, PM *tele-, PJ *túrù): PM *tel(i)-ge-, PTM *tel-ge
PA *č ̔amo ‘to suffer hardships’ (PT *čAm ‘fine, claim’): OT čam-ɣ-uq ‘slanderer’, PM *čima-ɣa- ‘queasy’, PK *čhắm- ‘to endure, bear’. Vovin (1997, 3-4) characterizes this morpheme as “transitivity flipper” (thus analogous to PA *-b-, see above) and, besides Kor. -0- and TM *-g-, relates here also the PJ verbal suffix *-i- (*tuk- ‘be attached’ / *tuka-i- ‘attach’, *dak- ‘to burn’, *daka-i- ‘to burn (intr.)’). There are prob

lems with this solution, however: we would correct those pairs to *tuk/ *tuka- and *dak- / *daka-, while the -i in OJ forms like tuke < *tukai, jake < *dakai should rather be regarded as a gerund suffix, just like the -i in the respective matches tuk-i and jak-i. But the forms of the type *tuk- themselves may go back to earlier *tuki- < *tuka-ji-, where *-ji- might reflect an earlier PA *-jV-, but hardly *-gV- (see above) One can also note a rather common TM suffix *-gā-n denoting the result of an action (see Benzing 58), having probably the same source. It thus seems that the causative meaning of *-g- in TM, Mong. and Kor. is secondary, being derived from an original factitive / intensive meaning. However, the main function of PA *-g-, attested in all branches (although in Korean it is somewhat difficult to find its traces - due to loss of intervocalic *-g-), is the formation of derived nouns and adjectives (both from verbal and nominal stems). The number of cross-language parallels here is huge, and vowels after *-g- may differ due to secondary affixation, but essentially this is a single derivational type: PA *ŋo ‘right’ (PT *oŋ): PM *eŋ-ge ‘south; front’, PTM *āŋ-gi- ‘right’ PA *àŕì ‘thorn, fang’ (PJ *ìrà ‘thorn’, cf. also Manchu ar-sun id.): PT *aŕɨ-g ‘fang’, PM *ari-ɣa- ‘fang, molar tooth’ PA *rV ‘open space’ (PT *(i)āra ‘space, distance’): PM *ara-ɣu ‘spaced, thin’, PTM *ara-gan ‘open space’ PA *bằt ̔í ‘dirt’ (PTM *batu- ‘frozen soil’, PJ *pìntì ‘dirt’): PT *batɨ-g ‘swamp, marsh’, PM *bat-ga ‘dirt’ (perhaps also PK *ptắi ‘dirt’) PA *bujri ‘well, spring’ (PTM *bira ‘river’, PK *ù- ‘well, spring’): PTM *bira-ga- ‘spring’, PJ *bì ‘well’ PA *bure ‘flea’ (not attested suffixless, cf.

PTM *pün-čül- ‘hedgehog’): PT *enü-k ‘young of a wild animal, puppy’, PM *hüne-gen ‘fox’, PTM *püńe-kī ‘jerboa, weasel’ Only in a very small number of cases do we encounter PA *-k- as a deverbative verbal suffix, cf.: PA *úrù ‘to gather, crowd’ (PM *ir- id., Kor. ul ‘clan’, PJ *ú(n)tì id.): PT *ir-k- ‘to gather’, PM *ir-ge-n ‘people’ PA *kāšu ‘to tickle’ (PT *gīči-): PT *Kčɨ-k, PM *giǯi-ge, PTM *kaša-ka-, PJ *kúsú-nkú-r
PA *k ̔úŋu ‘to bend, bow’ (not attested suffixless, cf. PT *Kɨjŋɨ-r-, PM *keji-ǯaŋ, *keje-de-): PT *Kɨjŋɨ-k ‘curved’, PM *keji-ge ‘oblique, slanting’, PTM *xuŋ-ke- ‘to bow’, PJ *kún-kú-m- ‘to be curved, bent’ PA *ńlo ‘to pluck, pick out’ (PT *jol-; PTM *ń[u]li- ‘to exuviate, fade’, PJ *mr- ‘to pluck, tear off’): PM *ǯul-ga- ‘to pick, pluck’, PTM *ń[u]li-ki‘naked’ It may well be so that in all these cases Mongolian (the only language actually pointing to *-k-) has an innovation: the original verbal stem developed a nominal usage through conversion, and the derivative in *-k- was built already from this secondary noun; and in the case of ǯul-ga- we may actually be dealing with PA factitive *-g-, and not with *-k-.
4.1.19. PA *-k ̔
Unlike PA *-k-, the aspirated *-k ̔- is quite well attested in building derived verbs from verbal stems, cf.: PA *bló ‘pale’ (PM *bala-ji ‘blind’, PTM *beli ‘pale’, PJ *pàrá- ‘to clear up’): Neg. bel-ki- ‘to whiten’, PK *pằr-k- ‘bright’ PA *blò ‘to soak, gush forth’ (Kor. pul-li- ‘to wet’, PJ *pùr ‘bath’): PT *bula-k ‘spring, well’, PM *bul-ka- ‘to soak’, PTM *b[ü]l-kü- id. PA *č ̔mu ‘to pinch, pluck’ (PM *čim ‘a pinch’, PJ *túm- ‘to pluck’): PM *čim-ki- ‘to pinch’, PK *čùm-kúi ‘fist, handful’



CHAPTER FOUR 217
PA *enu ‘to beware, attention’ (PM *(h)ana- ‘to beware, PT *anu- ‘to get ready’): PT *anu-k ‘ready’, PM *(h)aŋ-ka- ‘to pay attention’ PA *ằpV ‘to bend, turn’ (not attested suffixless; cf.

PA *k ̔óp ̔i ‘foam’ (PT *köp- ‘to swell’, PM *köɣe- ‘to foam, swell up’, PTM *x[o]pu- ‘foam’): PT *köpü-k ‘foam’, PM *köb-ke-ji- ‘to swell’ PA *k ̔úlo ‘to roll, turn’ (PT *Kula- ‘to roll down, fall’, PTM *xol- / *xul‘walk round, turn round’, Jpn. koro ‘round log’): PM *kol-ki-da- ‘to be restless, go round and round’, Jpn. koro-g- ‘to roll, rotate’ PA *lalV ‘weak, exasperated’(PM *nala-ji- ‘be slow, sluggish’, PTM *lali‘be hungry, weak, exasperated’): PT *jal-k- ‘to suffer pain, be nauseated’, PM *nal-ka-ji- ‘be faint, drowsy, weak’ PA *p ̔ísi ‘break, cleave, peck’ (PTM *pis-, PK *ps-, PJ *písí ‘fish-fork’): PM *hes-ke-, PTM *pis-k-, PK *ps-k-r, PJ *pisi(n)k
PA *t ̔ăru ‘to curse’ (PTM *turē-) : PT *tẹr-k-, PM *tar-kiAs we see, in many of the above cases nominalization of the derived form in *-k ̔- also occurs (cf. PT *bula-k, *anu-k, *köpü-k, PTM *obo-ka, PK *čùm-kúi, *ps-k-r, PJ *àpù-kuà), and in some of the cases all available derivatives are only nominal, cf.: PA *kopV ‘to plane, whet’ (PTM *kuba-): PM *kobi-ki ‘a k. of chisel’, Orok qụwaqụ ‘plough’ PA *ri ‘to cover’ (PTM *ora- ‘become covered’, PK *òrái ‘door’): PM *örü-ke ‘cover of roof window’, PTM *ur-ke ‘door’ PA *p ̔áru ‘to spin, plait, wrap’ (PTM *por-): PT *ar-ka-g ‘weft, woof’, PK *pòrò-kí ‘swaddlingclothes’) The deverbative instrumental suffix *-ku is rather widely attested in TM (see Benzing 1011), and it is this suffix that corresponds to PM *-ki in Orok qụwa-qụ = PM *kobi-ki (see above); one can thus suspect that this usage was already present in PA. The same form seems also to be reflected in PJ *-ku ‘adjective and verb nominalizer’ and MKor. -ko ‘subordinative gerund marker’ (see Vovin 1997, 9). But the largest group of derivatives here, just as in the cases with PA *-g- and *-k-, are denominative nouns, cf. the following cross-language parallels: PA *ắni ‘very’ (PTM *ana- ‘very’, PK *àńí ‘first, beginning’): PT *eŋ(k) ‘very’, PM *aŋ-ka ‘very, extremely; original’ PA *ằra ‘back, behind’ (PM *aru): PT *ăr-ka ‘back’, PM *aru-ki ‘back, behind’, PTM *ar-ka- ‘back’

PJ *dp-r): PM *ǯob-ki, PTM *ǯup(u)-ku



CHAPTER FOUR 219
Although the semantics of most of these derivatives is quite neutral, we should note cases like *ŋōjč ̔u ‘small’ > Mong. *öčü-ken, *kŭŋi ‘child’ > Mong. *kew-ken, PTM *kuŋā-kān, and the well-known fact that these suffixes (Mong. -ken / -qan, PTM *-kān) are productive diminutives. It seems thus quite probable that PA *-k ̔- in its denominative function had a diminutive meaning (which remained productive in TM, see Benzing 58-59, and Mongolian, but can also be observed in many cases in Turkic, Korean and Japanese). Another source of this morpheme may be the adjectival marker *-k ̔(i)-, reflected in Mong. (-ki), Turkic (-kɨ /-ki), see EAS 2, 234; cf. also the PJ attributive adjectival suffix *-ki.
4.1.20. PA *-ŋ
The suffix *-ŋ- is not frequent, but firmly established for Altaic (see EAS 2, 229). It only forms nouns from verbs or nouns (cases of verbal usage of the -ŋ-derivatives are clearly secondary), and in this respect is fully synonymous with PA *-g-. Cf. the following cross-language lexical matches: PA *ja ‘to go, walk’ (PTM *āja- ‘to run quickly’): PM *aja-ŋ ‘journey, travel’, PTM *āj[a]-ŋ ‘swift’, PJ *àjùm- ‘to walk’ PA *dlo ‘wing, shoulderblade’ (PT *jāl ‘counter, mane’, PM *dalu ‘shoulderblade’, *dali ‘wing’): PM *dala-ŋ ‘counter, scruff’, PK *tằrŋái > *tằr’ái ‘wing (of a saddle)’ PA *na ‘dawn, dusk’ (PTM *ine- ‘to dawn’): PT *ɨŋ-ɨr ‘dusk’, PTM *ine-ŋī ‘day’
PA *ìri ‘to rot, pus, be sick’ (PT *iri- ‘to rot’): PT *iri-ŋ ‘pus’, PJ *ìtà-m- ‘to be sick’ PA *ŕu ‘trace, furrow’ (PT *īŕ / *ŕ): PM *(h)ira-ɣa- ‘ripple, riffle’, PK *ìráŋ ‘furrow’ PA *koĺa ‘to steal, deceive’ (PTM *kola ‘cunning, deceit’): PT *K(i)aĺaŋ ‘lazy, vile’, PM *kula-ga-j ‘robber, thief’, PJ *kasu-m- ‘to steal, rob’ PA *k ̔alo ‘girth, tug’ (PT *xala ‘tug, belt’): PT *Kola-ŋ ‘saddlegirth’, PK *kora-ŋ ‘fetters’ PA *k ̔č ̔i ‘a k. of cereal’ (PT *kȫče ‘barley’): PM *küči-ŋ-gi ‘a leguminous plant’, PK *kìčàŋ ‘millet’ PA *mólu ‘ridge, corner’ (PTM *mulu, PK *mằrằ): PT *buluŋ, PJ *múnáIt is not quite clear whether this suffix can be related to the productive PTM *-ŋ(u)- denoting “nicht entfremdbares Eigentum” (see Benzing 61-62 for a discussion of this morpheme), which otherwise has no known Altaic parallels. On the other hand, *-ŋ- in deverbatives like

*āja-ŋV, *ìri-ŋV etc. may be compared with the productive attested TM suffix *-ŋa- forming “past durative actions” (“vorübergehend andauernde Handlung”), see Benzing 120.

4.2.1.2 Plural suffixes
PA *-t ̔-: PTM *-ta(n) / *-te(n) (basically in Manchu, in other languages used as the 3d plur. pronom. suffix), Mong. -d, Turk. *-t, PJ *ta-ti, PK *-tɨ-r This is the most common and probably original PA plural suffix.



INTRODUCTION
222
PA *-s-: PTM *-sa-l (Benzing 76-78), Mong. *-s This suffix is restricted to the TM-Mong. area, and may in fact reflect the PA collective *-sa (see above). PA *-l-: PTM *-l, PT *-lar, PM *-nar, PJ *-ra In Turkic, Mongolian and Japanese this suffix seems to have been originally restricted to forming plurals of animate nouns, and in Japanese it basically reflects associativity (“brothers and those together with them, associated with them”). Ramstedt (EAS 2) suggests that it was originally a separate noun *larV which accounts for the specific reflex n- in Mongolian (otherwise typical for *l- in word-initial position, see above). Turkic and Japanese already treat it as a suffix (word-initial *lis absent in Turkic, just as word-initial *r- is absent in Japanese). Loss of *-rV in TM and Japanese, however, is difficult to account for - perhaps one should think of an early assimilative process in a suffixed morpheme (something like *-larV > *-lrV > *-llV). Above we have already dealt with the suffix *-ŕV which may have had an original dual meaning. Outside Turkic the reflexes of *-ŕ- cannot be distinguished from those of *-r-, and it seems interesting to note the peculiar plural in *-r in TM, which occurs in nouns whose singular ends in *-n (like Evk. beju-n - beju-r ‘wild deer’, oro-n - oro-r ‘tame deer’ etc., see Benzing 1025). We have suggested above that this *-n may have had a special “singulative” meaning, and we may note that words with the *-ŕV suffix often have counterparts with *-n in other languages (cf. PT *kökü-ŕ ‘breast’, PJ *kəkə-rə ‘heart’ vs. PM *kökö-n, PTM *kuku-n ‘breast’ etc.). It is therefore tempting to reconstruct “singular” *-nV opposed to “dual” *-ŕV, “plural” *-t ̔V and “associative plural” *larV. It should be stressed that in PA, as in most modern Altaic languages, all these suffixes need not have been obligatory, probably only used in situations when the number of a noun had to be explicitly expressed, and thus implementing something similar to the category of determination (note that Korean may reflect this *-n as its ‘thematic case’, see Холодович 11):
*kk ̔è ‘breast, two breasts, breasts’ (indeterm.) *kk ̔è-nV ‘one breast’ : *kk ̔è-ŕV ‘two breasts’ : (*kk ̔è-t ̔V ‘many breasts’) (determ.) *na ‘brother, two brothers, brothers’ (indeterm.) *na-nV ‘one brother’ : *na-ŕV ‘two brothers’ : *na-t ̔V ‘many brothers’ : *na-larV ‘brothers and those with them’ (determ.) Such a situation would account quite well for the various plural patterns that we observe in modern Altaic languages.



CHAPTER FOUR 223
4.2.2. Numerals
Common Altaic numerals are treated as lexemes in the body of the dictionary, so here we shall just list the forms with a few additional comments: 1 *buri: PT *bir, PJ *pitə (cf. also PM *büri ‘all, each’, PK *pìr- ‘at first’). This seems to be the original PA numeral for ‘one’. Other languages have innovations: PM *nige ‘one’ < PA *nŏŋe ‘single’ (PT *jaŋɨŕ ‘single’, PJ *nəmi ‘only’, PTM *noŋ- / *non- ‘be the first, begin’); PTM *emu(/*ume-) ‘one’ < PA *emo ‘front’ (PT *öm-gen ‘upper part of breast’, PM *emü- ‘front’; PK *hằnàh ‘one’ < PA *sóna ‘single, one of a pair’ (PT *sɨŋar ‘one of a pair’, PM *son-du- ‘odd’, Man. soni- ‘single, odd’, PJ *sa‘together, reciprocally’).
2 *tubu: Old Bulg. tvi-rem ‘second’; PM *ǯiw-rin ~ *ǯui-rin ‘two (fem.)’; PTM *ǯube- ‘two’; PK *tū, *tū-rh ( = *tubu, *tubu-rh) ‘two’. Some languages have introduced innovations: PT *ẹk(k)i ‘two’ < PA *p ̔òk ̔e ‘pair, couple’ (cf. also PT *ẹkiŕ ‘twins’ = PM *(h)ekire id.); PM *gojar ‘two’ (changed to *qojar in North. Mong. under the influence of *qo-rin ‘20’ or *qoji ‘follow, behind’) < PA *gojV ‘different, other’ (PTM *goj / *gia, PJ *kía); PJ *puta- ‘two’ < *puč ̔u ‘pair, half’ (PT *buč-uk, PK *pča-k).
3 *ŋu: PM *gu-rban ‘three’, *gu-čin ‘thirty’, PT *o-tuŕ ‘thirty’ ( = PM *gu-čin), PJ *mi-. PT *ü- in *üč ‘three’ may also reflect the same root, although the suffixation is not clear. TM and Korean have interesting innovations. PTM *ila-n ‘three’ goes back to a PA root *ìlù meaning ‘third (or next after three = fourth)’, consisting of three objects’, reflected in PT as *ölöŋ ‘song with three out of four verses rhyming (first, second and fourth)’ and in PJ as *ùrù-pu ‘bissextile (year or month)’; PK *si(h) ‘three’ appears to go back to PA *séjra meaning ‘an object consisting of three parts’, cf. PM *sere-ɣe ‘trident, pitchfork’ = PJ *sárápi ‘rake, pitchfork’. Numerals after ‘three’ are well reconstructable because of precise TM - Japanese matches, although other languages have in some cases introduced their own innovations. 4 *tōjV: PTM *dü-gin = PJ *də-. This is one of the most stable PA numerals and it is also preserved in PT *dȫ-rt, PM *dö-rben ‘four’, *dö-čin ‘forty’. The etymology of MKor. nəi ‘four’ remains unclear. 5 *t ̔u: PTM *tu-ńga, PJ *i-tu- (the prefixed i- is somewhat unclear: it is also used as a separate word meaning ‘fifty’, but the historical root here is no doubt *tu-). This numeral is also preserved in PM *ta-bun



INTRODUCTION
224
‘five’, *ta-bin ‘fifty’ and PK *tà- ‘five’. PT, however, has replaced this common numeral by an etymologically obscure *bẹĺ(k). 6 *ńu: PTM *ńu-ŋu-, PJ *mu-. Also reflected in Mong. as *ǯi-rgu- ‘six’, *ǯi-ran ‘sixty’, perhaps also in MKor. as jə-(sɨs) - although loss of initial *ń- is not quite regular. An innovation of obscure origin has been introduced in PT (*altɨ). 7 *nadi: PTM *nada-n, PJ *nana-. The same numeral is reflected in PT *jẹt(t)i and PK *nìr-(kúp). The relationship of Mong. *dolu-ɣan ‘seven’, *dala-n ‘seventy’ is somewhat unclear: it may suggest an original protoform *ĺadi- or *ladi- with dissimilation (or metathesis) in Mongolian. 8 *ǯa: PTM *ǯa-pkun, PJ *da-. Problematic is the relationship of PK *j-t- ‘eight’ (possible if we assume a dialectal development *ǯ- > *j-, like in *jr(h) ‘ten’ < *ǯōŕo, see below). The origin of PM *naji-man and PT *sekiŕ ‘eight’ remains obscure. 9 *k ̔egVnV: PTM *xegün, PJ *kəkənə-. Other languages have introduced innovations: PT *tokuŕ, PM *je-sün ‘nine’, *ji-ren ‘90’, PK *a-hop). 10 *čobe (or *tobe): PTM *ǯuba-n, PJ *təwə. Being a direct TM-Jpn. isogloss, this root is the most probable candidate for ‘10’ in PA. Other languages have introduced innovations going back to roots with a general meaning ‘many, big number’: cf. *ǯōŕo > PK *jr(h) ‘ten’, but PT *jǖŕ ‘hundred’, Man. ǯiri, ǯirun ‘a very big number’, PJ *dr- ‘10000’; *p ̔VbV > PT *ō-n ‘10’, PM *ha-rban ‘10’, *ha-na ‘all’, Orok pōwo ‘a bundle of 10 squirrels’, Nan. poã ‘collection, gathering’, PJ *-pə (-pua) ‘hundred’ (in names of hundreds). 20 *k ̔ura: PTM *xori-n, PM *kori-n. This is the only numeral after ‘3’ which does not reveal a direct TM-Jpn. correspondence. Therefore we suspect that the PJ word for ‘20’, viz. *pata-ti, may have originally sounded like *kata-ti (which is the regular reflex of *k ̔ura), but was influenced by ‘2’ (*puta-tu, see above) and consequently changed to *pata-ti. The same root is evidently present in PT *Kɨrk ‘forty’ - perhaps an original reduplication < *Kɨr-kɨr (‘20’+’20’); the simple *Kɨr must have been replaced by *(j)egir-mi, a form probably derived from *ẹk(k)i ‘two’. 100 *ńằmò: PTM *ńamā, PJ *muàmuà, PM *ǯaɣu-n ( < *ńam-ŋu-). Cf. also PT *jom- ‘big number, all’ (in the meaning ‘hundred’ replaced by *jǖŕ, see above). Korean has introduced an innovation, *ón, of obscure origin. 1000 *čùmi: PTM has no word for thousand (all languages reveal a later mongolism miŋgan < PM *miŋgan = PT *bɨŋ ‘thousand’). However, PJ *ti ‘thousand’ has a plausible parallel in PK *čmn id. and PT *Tümen ‘10000’. PA *miŋa is a local Mong.-Turk. isogloss (resembling Middle



CHAPTER FOUR 225
Chinese mwn ‘10000’) and possibly not common Altaic, so the original root seems to be *čùmi reflected in Kor., Jpn. and Turkic. We see thus that - despite a rather widespread misconception of numerals being not reconstructable for PA - PA had a complete set of numerals from 1 to 1000, and most of them are recoverable because of significant archaisms preserved in the TM and Japanese areas. Some individual systems were considerably modified (thus, Turkic introduced innovations for most numerals except ‘one’, ‘three’ (?), ‘four’ and ‘seven’; Mongolian introduced innovations for ‘one’, ‘eight’, ‘nine’, ‘ten’ and ‘thousand’ etc.), but the original system is nevertheless clear.

1 p. *b, pl. *ba ~ *bu (obl. *mi-n-, *ma-n- ~ *mu-n-)
For PA we can also reconstruct a stem *ŋa, reflected in some cases as Mong. *na-d-, *na-m-, and preserved in Korean as *nà and in Jpn. as *a-. 2 p. *si, pl. *su (obl. *si-n-, *su-n-)
It seems also possible to reconstruct a second stem *na, preserved in Kor. *n and Jpn. *ná, and possibly reflected in the PT 2d p. ending *-ŋ (although velarization here is not quite clear). The relationship within the suppletive pairs *bi - *ŋa and *si - *na is not quite clear; the forms *ŋa and *na may have originally been restricted to some oblique cases (cf. the situation in Mongolian). We must also mention the isolated Mong. 2d p. pronoun: sing. či, pl. ta, presupposing original *t ̔i, pl. *t ̔a. Although Altaic parallels are lacking, the pronoun is no doubt archaic (having certain Nostratic parallels: PIE *t, PU *ti-). The stems *t ̔i and *na are thus both candidates for the stem of PA oblique cases of the 2d p. pronoun. *na may be a Kor.-Jpn. innovation (the Turkic parallel here is not quite secure), but one can also not exclude a possibility that *t ̔i and *na were opposed in some other way (e.g., in number).

4.2.3.4. Reflexive pronouns
It can be suggested that a function similar to that of a reflexive pronoun was fulfilled by the stem *mēno ‘self; body’ (possibly related, and partially confused, with *méŋu ‘whole’).
4.2.4. Adjectives
In Proto-Altaic, adjectives were hardly distinct from nouns or participial verbal forms. There is, however, one specific morpheme that was probably regularly used for deriving attributes (= adjectives) from nouns and nominal forms, viz. PA *-k ̔i, well detectable in Mong. -ki, PT *-k, PTM *-ki and Jpn. (attributive adjectival) -ki. This suffix evidently could also be joined to the genitive marker *-ńV, resulting in a contraction *-ń-k ̔i > *-ŋi, *-ŋ in TM and Turkic. Another suffix that could form attributes (=adjectives) from nouns was probably *-t ̔u > Mong. -tu, Jpn. -tu (the latter has probably merged *-t ̔u and the dative/locative *du, see above).
4.2.5. Verbs
In all Altaic languages verbal stems may be simple or derived - either from nouns or from verbs. In the latter case productive suffixes usually form what is called voices or diatheses. The following verbal forms can be reconstructed for PA: *-b- passive / causative *-t- intransitive / passive *-t ̔- transitive *-n- intransitive / reflexive *-č ̔- intensive *-ǯ- intransitive (medial?) *-ĺ- reciprocal *-ŕ- transitive / causative *-s- desiderative / inchoative *-g- factitive / intensive All these suffixes have been described above in the section concerning derivation. Their productivity varies in subbranches of Altaic, and it is not quite clear which of them actually formed part of the verbal paradigm, and which were less productive and purely derivational in Proto-Altaic.



CHAPTER FOUR 227
Some of these suffixes do not actually change the voice or diathesis, but rather modify the character of action, and should be perhaps characterized as moods. Among the suffixes above such are the desiderative / inchoative *-s- (see EAS 2, 83) and the intensive *-č ̔-. Another common Altaic mood suffix is *-m-, originally probably optative and reflected as optative *-ma-, *-mu- in PTM (see Benzing 121), MKor. intention marker -ma and assumptive (hypothetical) *-m- in OJ (see Vovin 1997, 7). An imperative (non-2d person) in *-nV seems to be reflected in OT *-(jɨ)n and OJ *-na. Lack of a suffix (a pure verbal stem) was probably used for the 2d person imperative mood (see EAS 2, 81-82).
4.2.5.1 Participial and tense / aspect suffixes
Verbal stems - simple and derived - in Altaic languages are usually followed by participial suffixes, and such forms can function either as attributive ( = participles) or finite. The following participial suffixes can be reconstructed for Proto-Altaic: PA *-jV ‘a gerund suffix’: PT *-(j)a, PM *-ɣa, PKor. -a / -ə, PJ *-i (see EAS 2, 108-111, Vovin 1997, 5, calling the morpheme “infinitive”); PA *-p ̔V ‘a gerund suffix (probably perfective, see EAS 2, 122-124): PT *-p, PM *-ba(j), PTM *-pī (Benzing 143), PJ *-(m)pa; PA *-rV ‘aorist or indefinite present’ (perhaps originally intransitive, see above): PT *-r; PM *-ra / -re (supinum); PTM *-ra ‘aorist of the 1st class of verbs’; Kor. -r indefinite present or future suffix; PJ *-r-u (after consonantal stems *-u) ‘general attributive verbal form’ (cf. Vovin 1997, 4, reconstructing this morpheme as attributive); PA *-t ̔V ‘past tense’: PT *-t- ‘past (or perfect) suffix’, Kor. -t- ‘past (or regressive) suffix’, PJ *-t- ‘past suffix’ (see EAS 2, 115-117, Vovin 1997, 7); PA *-lV transitive (?) participle, with somewhat unclear function, see above; PA *-k ̔V ‘preterite’: PJ *-ki, PK *-kə- (Vovin 1997, 6). The suffix is lost in Turkic, while Mong. and TM seem to preserve it within the compound suffix *-k ̔sV- (PTM *-ksa-, see Benzing 140; not *-kV-, as stated by Vovin), Mong. past gerund -g-sa-n. It is interesting to mention that, whereas PJ *-ki is a finite morpheme (used in a sentence-final predicate), the same preterite paradigm in Japanese includes the attributive *-si (possibly related to PTM *-s-aorist, see above); the Mong.-Tung. compound *-k ̔-sV- may in fact be a combination of these two morphemes.



INTRODUCTION
228
TM languages reflect also participles ( = aorist suffixes) in *-s- and *-d-, see Benzing 123-128, which seem to be opposed to *-r- as intransitive (medial) vs. transitive (active), but it is so far unclear whether it is a TM innovation or an archaic feature. *-s- seems to have a parallel in Japanese (see above), and *-d- in Mongolian (praeteritum imperfecti *-ǯi, see Poppe 1965, 265). There may also be traces of past (or perfect) participles in *-č ̔V and *-šV (on *-šV within the dubitative *-ma-šV see below). It appears that the *-t ̔V- and *-k ̔V-, perhaps also *-sV- and *-dV(tense or aspect) morphemes directly followed the verbal stem (consisting of the root + voice / diathesis modifiers), while the *-jV, *-p ̔V, *-rV and *-lV markers acted as converbs and occupied the next position in the verbal wordform. Many details, however, are still to be worked out.
4.2.5.2 Personal endings
Conjugation with personal suffixes is attested in Turkic, Mongolian and TM, but is completely absent from Korean and Japanese. In most cases the personal suffixes coincide with personal pronouns, so the morphemes could be secondarily added to the verbal wordform in individual subbranches. An opposition of the 2d - non-2d personal endings may be, however, reconstructed for the imperative mood (see above on the Turkic-Japanese matching *-nV marker).
4.2.5.3 Negation
There are two common Altaic negative particles: *āni (probably general negation) and *ma (probably a prohibitive particle). The existing evidence suggests strongly that they were independent words in Proto-Altaic (for *ma cf. Man. u-me and MKor. mō-t, functioning as separate words; for *āni cf. Chuv. an, TM *ān-, MKor. an-, Jpn. na- functioning as separate words). In some branches, however, they tend to become incorporated into the structure of a verbal wordform: thus PT has generalized the negative particle *-m- (which has thus superseded the original optative *-m-, on which see above), and Japanese, the negative particle *-an-. The negative (prohibitive) particle *ma can perhaps be also discovered within the OJ dubitative (or irreal optative) marker -ma-si, which A. Vovin (1997, 8) has compared with the PTM subjunctive marker *-mča- ( ~ *-mša-), thus presupposing PA *ma-šV. A third archaic negative particle (verb) is *e, attested in TM and Mongolian. It seems worth mentioning that in TM it is combined with



CHAPTER FOUR 229
the aorist marker -s-, and in Mongolian it is attested as *e-se. It may thus have been differentiated from *āni by some additional tense/aspect feature (being, e.g., originally a past negative).

This list is basically the same as given in Starostin 1991 (pp. 25-63, 85-104), but with some additions and corrections added during the years of work on the Altaic dictionary, which have consequently resulted in some calculational changes, albeit statistically insignificant. The average percent of matches revolves around 20, which gives us the date of split of Proto-Altaic at around the end of 6th millennium B.C. We see an increase up to about 25% between Turkic, Mongolian and TM, and an increase to 33% between Korean and Japanese, which would speak in favour of two basic subbranches of Altaic. However, if we look at the figures in more detail and take into account the division between 35 more stable items and 65 less stable items, proposed by S. Y. Yakhontov, the picture appears to be somewhat more complicated.

This chart shows us that while the overall 35 / 65 wordlist ratio is > 1 in all cases (the situation which indicates genetic relationship, meaning that the rate of matches within the most stable 35 word range is higher than the rate of matches within the less stable 65 word range), in two cases - Mongolian-TM and Kor.-Jpn. - it is dangerously close to 1. Lexicostatistically this may indicate the borders of ancient dialect zones within Proto-Altaic, suggesting that Tungus-Manchu does not really



CHAPTER FIVE 235
constitute a unity with Turkic-Mongolian, and throwing some doubts on the genetic unity of Korean-Japanese. Additionally it provides an explanation why the genetic situation within Altaic looks somewhat different from that within, e.g., Indo-European - which was the main reason for the whole anti-Altaic criticism. Altaic appears to be different from Indo-European in two main respects: a) it is somewhat older than Indo-European: while the split of Proto-Indo-European (or Proto-Indo-Hittite) can be dated to the 4th millennium B.C., the split of Proto-Altaic must have occurred at least a thousand years earlier; b) whereas the subbranches of Indo-European are rather old (e.g., Balto-Slavic may be dated around the beginning of the 1st millennium B.C, and Indo-Iranian - by the verge of the 2d and 3d millennia B.C.), the subbranches of Altaic are considerably younger: Turkic - beginning of our era, Mongolian - around the 10th century A.D., Tungus-Manchu - around the 4th century B.C., Japanese around the 5th century A.D., Korean - around the 11th century A.D. Furthermore, whereas the oldest texts in ancient Indo-European languages are attested quite early, the written monuments of Altaic languages date back not earlier than to the 8th century A.D. This all creates an impression of a much more distant genetic relationship between Altaic languages than that between Indo-European languages. Consequently - basically due to the absence of archaic attestation - Proto-Altaic is somewhat more difficult to reconstruct than Proto-Indo-European. It is also quite possible that some other branches of Altaic might have existed, but they could have been wiped out by later waves of migrations of Altaic (and non-Altaic) languages. The overall distribution of lexical isoglosses confirms the above classification, but yields some additional information on the dialect distribution within Proto-Altaic. The core of the common Altaic vocabulary is constituted by etyma reflected in Turko-Mongolian (at least in Turkic or Mongolian) and in Korean-Japanese (at least in Korean or Japanese) - with or without Tungus-Manchu parallels. The number of such roots within the present volume is 1841; most of them (1553) are also reflected in Tungus-Manchu. There are, however, two other lexical groups: a) Turkic-Mongolian roots with Tungus-Manchu parallels (615); without Tungus-Manchu parallels (57)



INTRODUCTION
236
b) Korean-Japanese roots with Tungus-Manchu parallels (195); without Tungus-Manchu parallels (23) We see thus that Tungus-Manchu occupies a specific position within the Altaic family, sharing a large number of isoglosses both with the Turkic-Mongolian and the Korean-Japanese branches. In the dictionary we call the former “Western isoglosses” and the latter, “Eastern isoglosses”. Historically such a situation may be explained by a “central” position of Tungus-Manchu among the Proto-Altaic dialects. At the same time, one can also not exclude a scenario of later prehistorical borrowings (already after the split of Proto-Altaic, but before a wide geographical separation of Turko-Mongolian and Tungus-Manchu, on one hand, and Tungus-Manchu and Korean-Japanese, on the other). The position of Tungus-Manchu within Altaic thus resembles the position of Greek within Indo-European: due to its original “central” geographic location, Greek shares a large number of isoglosses both with European languages (primarily Italo-Celtic) and with Indo-Iranian languages. The Proto-Altaic nature of almost a thousand “Western” or “Eastern” isoglosses mentioned above is questionable; nevertheless we decided to include them into the dictionary because potentially any of them may turn out to be common Altaic - there is always a chance that, e.g., a Korean match for a Western isogloss exists but has not yet been recovered, or a chance that an archaic etymon reflected in Korean-Japanese has been lost in Turko-Mongolian. We must stress that phonetically and morphologically these isoglosses behave just like all other common Altaic roots. To sum up: Proto-Altaic split into three branches, viz. Turco-Mongolian, Tungus-Manchu and Korean-Japanese, around the 6th millennium B.C. Tungus-Manchu must have occupied a central dialectal position, which explains its shared isoglosses both with Turko-Mongolian and Korean-Japanese. Two subbranches - Turko-Mongolian and Korean-Japanese - in their turn, had split rather early, around the 4th millennium B.C. However, reconstructing Proto-Turko-Mongolian or Proto-Korean-Japanese would in fact be almost equivalent to reconstructing Proto-Altaic, because of small time span separating those units from the original protolanguage. There is still some doubt about the existence of common Korean-Japanese: the specific similarities between these two subbranches might be due to secondary dialectal interaction. The next splits occurred already closer to our era: first the split of Tungus-Manchu, next the split of Turkic, Japanese and Korean dialects.



STRUCTURE OF THE DICTIONARY AND ADOPTED CONVENTIONS
The dictionary is presented in the alphabetical order of PA reconstructions. Each dictionary item consists of: 1. The proposed PA reconstruction. Variants are supplied in brackets: e.g. the notation *ágà ( ~ e-) means that for PA both *ágà and *égà can be reconstructed. Capital V denotes a vowel of unknown quality. Vowel quantity is explicitly specified; if there is neither a breve nor a macron sign above the vowel, it means that quantity is unknown in this case. 2. The reconstructed meaning. 3. A short enumeration of subgroup reflexes 4. Detailed reflexes in subgroups (in the order: Tungus-Manchu, Mongolian, Turkic, Japanese, Korean). For each of the subgroups we give a reconstruction and reflexes in ancient and modern languages. The meanings are not reconstructed: rather, we enumerate attested meanings and refer to these numbers while listing individual reflexes. For most languages the basic sources (see below) were Russian dictionaries, which means that most meanings had to be translated into English from Russian. To preserve semantic accuracy, we decided to keep the original Russian meanings which are always given in brackets after the English ones. Each section may be completed by more or less detailed comments and references (given in small type). 5. General comments and references (if any). The following conventions are used in individual reconstructions: 1. In Turkic and Tungus-Manchu, only long vowels are explicitly marked, and short vowels are left unmarked. 2. The placement of any symbol within brackets means that the presence of the denoted phoneme (sound) cannot be ascertained: this is usual, e.g., in PT for (i)a, i.e. *ia or *a when there is no Chuvash reflex; in PTM for (x), i.e. *x- or *0- when there are no Southern Tungus-Manchu reflexes; in PM for (h), i.e. *h- or *0- when there is no Middle Mongolian attestation or Southern Mongolian reflex; in PJ for (d), i.e. *d- or *0- in a position before *i (in the latter case, how

ever, we prefer writing just *i- when external evidence explicitly shows that there was no *d-). 3. Capital letters (except capital G, traditionally used for denoting a voiced uvular) are used in the following way: A (in Turkic): *a or *ạ E (in Turkic): *e or *ẹ K (in Turkic): *k or *g; (in Tungus-Manchu): *k or *x T (in Turkic): *t or *d V: a vowel of unknown quality
Adopted transcription
Throughout the dictionary we have attempted to use a unified system of transcription, generally accepted in the German and Moscow schools of Altaic studies (its basic features are: using the symbols c, ʒ, č, ǯ, š, ž for affricates and sibilants; j for the palatal resonant; ɨ for the high back unrounded vowel). We have, however, preserved traditional orthography for romanized Modern Japanese. For Jurchen we use the phonetic transcription proposed in Мудрак 1985, 1988a; this transcription, as well as the transcription of Middle Mongolian works taken from HY is based on Early Mandarin as reconstructed in Tōdō 1970 and Dragunov 1929, 1930. Notation of length: all long vowels are marked with the diacritic ; short vowels (if specifically marked) with the diacritic ; long (tense) consonants - by a colon :. Palatalization: all palatalized consonants are marked with the diacritic . Nasalization: all nasalized vowels and consonants are marked with the diacritic . Closed vowels: closed e, a (in Tungus-Manchu languages also u, i, ə, ъ) are marked with the diacritic  . Special vocalic symbols: in Chuvash, we use ъn, ən to denote specific labialized mid-high and mid-low vowels; in Kalmuck,  is used to denote the mid-low long front vowel; in Even,  is used to denote the mid-high reduced vowel. Prosodic symbols: “ after a vowel is used to denote pharyngealization in Tuva and Tofalar; high tone (pitch) in Korean and Japanese is marked with the diacritic ; low tone (pitch) in Korean and Japanese, with the diacritic . In the Tokyo system,  is used rather for marking the place of accent (the pitch summit of a word); words without such a summit (the so called “zenhei” words, articulated with a gradual rising of pitch towards the end of the word) are marked by the diacritic  on

the first syllable. In the Kagoshima system, where a word can also contain only one high-pitch syllable, this syllable is marked by ; the words without high pitch are, however, marked with  on each syllable. The “rising-falling” pitch at the end of the word in Kyoto is marked by the diacritic .
Sources
For each language, the most authoritative source was chosen. If the form is quoted from that source and if it is an alphabetically ordered dictionary, no references are usually given. In all other cases references are given in brackets (without a page number if the referenced work is an alphabetically ordered dictionary, with a page number otherwise). Here is the list of sources utilized for each individual language:
Tungus-Manchu
For all languages except spoken Manchu, the basic source is ТМС; for spoken Manchu we used Yamamoto 1969 (with references to the numbers of lexical items, since this is not an alphabetical dictionary). Numbered references are also given to Grube 1896 for Jurchen.
Mongolian
Written Mongolian: KW; in most cases reference is also given to L Middle Mongolian: SH Khalkha: МРС Kalmuck: KW Ordos: DO Mogol: Ligeti 1954; references are also given to ZM and Weiers Dagur: MGCD Dongxiang: MGCD Baoan: MGCD Shira-Yughur: MGCD Mongor: SM

◊ ТМС 1, 9. Cf. perhaps also Nan. Naikh. aoǯan ‘a talisman against the throat disease’ (contaminated with aoǯan ‘ruff’; with a carved picture of a ruff), see Он. 44.
PMong. *owči interior side of the cheek; mouthful (внутренняя сторона щеки; глоток, количество жидкости, которое можно набрать в рот): WMong. ouči, oɣuči L 602, 625; Kh. ōč; Bur. ōšo(n); Kalm. ōčə; Ord. ōč ̔i ‘gorgée’; Mog. ɔči- ‘to drink’ (Weiers); Dag. ūčə; Dong. oču(očɨ-); S.-Yugh. ūčə; Mongr. ōi- ‘to drink’ (SM 299), ūčiɣu ‘a drink’ (Тод. Мгр. 369).
◊ KW 292, MGCD 523. The Mongor forms could be derived from ū- ‘drink’ (v. sub *ṓp ̔à), but the affixation in that case would be unclear.

◊ Nam 341, KED 1076, 1077.
‖ An expressive kinship “nursery” word with the typical structure *VCV; the root must have denoted some elder relative, both male and female. Deriving TM *asī from a Chinese (ТМС 1,55) or Sino-Korean (SKE 15) source is quite impossible. The Mongolian reflexes are problematic: Mong. eǯei ‘mother, elder sister’ (whence Yak. eǯīj, Dolg. eǯij, see Кал. V 27, Stachowski 43) is probably < Turkic.; Mong. ečige ‘father’ reflects rather PA *t ̔è (q.v.). One should, however, note an isolated Dagur form ačā ‘father’ (Тод. Даг. 122), whence certainly Solon ača id. and possibly Evk. (Vit.) ači ‘ancestor’ (ТМС 1, 59).
≠áč ̔u to doubt: Tung. *aču-; Jpn. *útákáp-; Kor. *ču-b-. PTung. *aču- 1 to slander, slander 2 to answer (клеветать, клевета): Man. ačua-da-, ačuan 1; Nan. (On.) ačōgo- 2.

*ădV - *agà 273
‖ An Eastern isogloss; not quite certain because of sparse attestation in TM and Korean.
≠ădV to fit, equal, similar: Tung. *ada-; Mong. *adali; Turk. *ădaĺ. PTung. *ada- 1 twins 2 to unite, attach 3 close, neighbour (1 близнецы 2 соединять, присоединять 3 близкий, соседний): Neg. adaxụ 1; Man. ada- 2, adaki 3; Ul. adaụ 1; Ork. adāw 1; Nan. ada- 2, adō 1; Orch. adawu 1; Ud. ada ̔u 1 (Корм. 204).

◊ KW 21, MGCD 94. Mong. > Yak. atɨl, Dolg. atalɨ (Kał. MEJ 38, Stachowski 38), Evk. adalī (cf. Doerfer MT 98, Rozycki 11), Russ. Siber. adalí (Аникин 74).
PTurk. *ădaĺ friend, companion (друг, товарищ): OTurk. adaš (OUygh. - Buddh., Man.); Karakh. aδaš (MK, KB), ajaš (IM); Kirgh. ajaš; Yak. atas.
◊ VEWT 5, EDT 72. A hypothesis about *adaĺ < (compound) at-daĺ with ‘name’ as the first component is impossible (in that case we would expect *ataĺ and ‘namesake’ as the earliest meaning). The form attaš is attested since MTurk.: attaš ‘namesake’ (Tefs.), adaš ‘namesake’ (Chag. Sangl.), ataš ‘namesake’ (CCum.) - and contaminates with *adaĺ. Modern languages for the most part reflect the compound, see ЭСТЯ I 203-204. Cf. Tuva a’dašqɨ-lar ‘a father with his children’ (“namesakes”; NB: pharyngealization as a reflex of *-t-). A possible reflex of *adaĺ is Chuv. ural-a-š- ‘to agree about acquiring smth. collectively, together’ and ural-a-n- ‘to form a light circle (of astronomical bodies)’: both are semantically quite far from ura-la-n- ‘to recover’.
‖ A Western isogloss. Cf. several similar roots: *idV ‘to follow, lead’; *ude ‘to imitate, simulate’, with a natural tendency towards contamination.

The Jpn. form may be attributed here if it originally meant “rainy season” (cf. “rain, thunder” in TM); autumn is not so rainy in present-day Japan, but it must have been different in the original homeland.

‖ SKE 5, Martin 234, Колесникова 1972a, 77-78, АПиПЯЯ 80, 283 (confused with *ák ̔a), Лексика 225. Despite Poppe 95 Mong. aɣur ‘steam, anger’ hardly belongs here (see under *ap`i). The root should be distinguished from *ák ̔a, although they tend to be confused: thus, Mong. *ag ‘crack’ could quite possibly reflect *ák ̔a. Some phonetic comments: Mong. *aguji regularly < *aɣuji with velar fricative dissimilation; Korean has lost the first vowel in a long derivative (a rather frequent phenomenon).

Clauson (EDT 182) thinks that OUygh. ajɨ ‘very’ is an unusually early example of the elision of -g in ańɨɣ ‘evil’, which means ‘very’ in many OUygh. texts, but this is hardly plausible phonetically; so it may belong here, together with Khak. aj ‘very’ (although the final narrow ɨ is a problem).

‖ Ozawa 38-40, АПиПЯЯ 16, 71, Rozycki 18-19. Despite Doerfer MT 111, TM forms are hardly < Mong. (because of a semantic difference). A possible parallel in Turkic could be *adɨ[ĺ] > OT adɨt ‘handful’, Kirgh. adɨš, Yak. ɨtɨs ‘palm’ (VEWT 7, ЭСТЯ 1, 100-101, 410, Лексика 252, Stachowski 263), but there are some phonetic and semantic problems. Note, however, that OJ ata also denotes a small measure of length (8 sun, or about 12 centimetres) - rather a span than a fathom. Such a semantic development may presuppose an earlier usage of *alda in constructions like ‘big fathom’ - ‘small fathom’ ( = ‘span’) both in Turkic and Japanese.

◊ VEWT 14, ЭСТЯ 1, 140-141, Stachowski 32. VEWT confuses (after Bang and Brockelmann) the roots *al- ‘below’ and *āl ‘front’. They are indeed mixed in Kirgh. and Oyr. lit., where we have ald ‘front, below’, but are distinguished in dialects (Tuba: ald ‘front’, with a voicing in the consonant cluster after an old long vowel, but altɨ ‘below’). The Chuv. form probably goes back to the compound *koltuk altɨ ‘axillary concavity, gusset’ (attested in Tur., Gag., Az., see Дыбо 154). Most languages reflect *al-tɨ- (the simple form al is not attested, see the discussion in EDT 121), but the reality of the root *ăl is proved



*le - *le

by a different derivative in Yakut. Cf. also Sib.-Tat. alaša ‘low, low place’ (КСТТ 100). Another possible old derivative in -čak may be PT *aĺ(č)ak (Karakh. ašaq, Turkm. ašāq etc., see ЭСТЯ 1, 214-215) ‘below, bottom part; low, humble’: its traditional derivation from *āĺ- ‘to cross (a mountain)’ is unsatisfactory both phonetically and semantically. A certain problem is the attribution of the adjective *al-čak (see ЭСТЯ 1, 143-144, EDT 129). Older occurrences of alčaq (MK, KB, Tefs., Rabg. etc.) present the meaning ‘modest, humble’; cf. also Sib.-Tat. alcaq ‘valetudinarian’ (КСТТ 101), Turkm. alčak ‘affable’ and perhaps Tur. alčak ‘mean, vile’, alča- ‘to offend, humiliate’. This group of forms may in fact reflect a different root, otherwise represented by PT *Alɨg, see under *le ‘weak, tired’. Another group of forms - Chag. alčaq ‘bas’ (Pav. C.), Tur., Az., Crim.-Tat. (and Oghuz texts like Korkut) alčaq ‘low, low place’ probably represents an Oghuz innovative derivation in -čak from the root al- (which is why -lč- did not yield -š- here), perhaps influenced by Mong. alča-gar, alča-n ‘stunted, undersized’, derived from Mong. alčaji- ‘to spread legs apart’.

The root presents considerable difficulties because of widespread later interlingual borrowings (see TMN 2, 125, Щербак 1997, 97-98). A specific problem is raised by initial h- in some Southern Mongolian forms (Dong. hamura-, Bao. hamera-, Mongor xamurā- ‘to rest’). The aspiration here is evidently secondary, because it is absent both in Dagur and in most attested Middle Mongolian sources (but cf. MA hamisqu). It is, therefore, probable that these forms are in fact borrowed from modern Turkic dialects with secondary aspiration (cf. h- in Khalaj). This would be indeed an argument in favour of the whole *amura- group of words in Mong. to be regarded as borrowed from Turkic (although later reborrowings into modern Turkic languages were, of course, also possible). However, significant semantic and formal differences do not allow us to regard as borrowed, on the one hand, the Turkic forms going back to attested Old Uyghur (e.g. amɨr‘to love), on the other hand, Mong. ami-n ‘life, soul’ and amu- ‘to rest’.

◊ EDT 373, Ашм. X, 4-5, Федотов 1, 449-450. The OT form is usually regarded as derived from *bas- ‘to press’ (v. sub *pằsi), but external evidence suggests that this is one of the numerous inner Turkic folk-etymological reinterpretations. Chuv. pus “copec” needs some additional comments. According to Егоров 166 it can either be derived from pus‘break’ < Turk. *bas-, or be borrowed from Pers. pōst “skin” > Tur. post, Uzb. pust ‘id.’ (Turkic forms see in VEWT 386). The latter hypothesis is rather improbable because the form means ‘coin’ only in Chuv., and because this borrowing is absent in other languages of the Volga region. VEWT 387 suggests Chuv. pus < Mari puš ‘debt, tax’ < pu- ‘give’. The word is absent from the Mari dictionary, one only finds puɨšaš ‘arrears’; cf., on the other hand, Udm. pus ‘sign, subscription’ < Chuv. puzə id. < pus- ‘to press’. This etymology is, therefore, equally dubious, and our equation of Chuv. pus = OT basɨɣ seems preferable.

*bólò - *bolo 351
‖ Дыбо 313, Лексика 284. Martin 247, Whitman 210. The vocalism in Mong. *bul-či- is probably influenced by the descriptive root bul(bult-, buld-, bült- etc.) ‘to be swollen, swell’, see *bula. Note that PT, Mong. and Jpn. reflect a common derivative *bol-t ̔i- (*boli-t ̔V-).

◊ Accent is not quite clear: RJ has wórì, but modern dialects (except Kyoto which is ambiguous) point rather to *brì. This may be explained by a folk-etymological influence of *br- ‘to bend’.
‖ Mong. *bolǯu- > Evk. bolǯo etc., see Poppe 1966, 192, Doerfer MT 101; bolǯal ‘appointed time’ > Chag. bolǯal etc., see ЭСТЯ 2, 188-189, Щербак 1997, 200).

◊ EDT 364-365, ЭСТЯ 2, 140-142. Phonetic variants are explained by the transformation of the root into a postposition and, further, into a case ending. The form bile is attested quite early and therefore can be hardly treated as an assimilation < bir-le (derived from bir ‘1’, cf. bir-ge, bir-če with a similar meaning).

◊ EDT 767. Turk. > Kalm. manl, Dag. manū (Tod. 153) (probably contaminated with Mong. proper malur < *malul q. v. sub *máĺe). Uygh. molun ‘wild cat’ may be a mongolism.
‖ A Turk.-Tung. isogloss. Palatalized *-ń- in TM is a secondary assimilation result. The root must have denoted some wild predator. It is tempting to compare similar forms in Mong. and Jpn., denoting some (mythical?) aquatic predator: PJ *bàni ‘crocodile’, WMong. (БАМРС) banuqai ‘a rare aquatic creature, dwelling in water during daytime and on the shore during nighttime’ - but the semantic change seems too far-fetched.

PTurk. *bArɨk (?) unclear silhouette (неясный силуэт): Karakh. barɨq (MK); Yak. barɨk, boruk ‘darkness’.
◊ ДТС 84. A somewhat dubious etymon: the OT form is quoted from the Uzbek edition of MK, not confirmed by Clauson and Dizin; the sense of the passage is rather obscure; the Yak. form may be secondarily built on the basis of the borrowed barɨj-, boruj‘be badly visible’. But cf. perhaps Kirgh. (ep.) burqu ‘variety’?
PJpn. *púrí shape, sight (образ, вид): MJpn. furi; Tok. fùri; Kyo. fúrí; Kag. fúri.
◊ Usually regarded as a derivative from fur- ‘to shake’ which is rather dubious for semantic reasons.

The Turk.-Mong. parallel is an old etymology (starting with Pelliot 1935, 231) which Doerfer (TMN 2, 510-511) tries in vain to refute.

◊ VEWT 113-114, Егоров 328, Федотов 2, 426-427. Räsänen’s attempt to explain the verb as “baptism through immersion” (linking Kypch. čoqur ‘pit’ and Taranchi čoqur- ‘to sink’ (R 3, 2007) appears unconvincing. The former word is derived from čok- ‘to delve’, and the latter should be corrected to čökür- according to more modern sources. The semantic transfer of a pagan ceremony to the Christian one seems quite natural in an islamicized society. The same root may be represented by the exclamation (made during a libation), Oyr. čoq!, Shor šoq!, and further - the approbatory exclamation Kirgh. čok!, Kaz. šoq! etc. Quite unlikely is the hypothesis of a loan from Hebrew (Y. Malov, quoted in Федотов). In fact, the meaning in Chuv. (’pledge’) and the external parallels suggest that the religious component in the meaning of *čok- is relatively late (having evolved after the separation of Bulgars): ‘pledge’ > ‘sacrifice’ > ‘praying’ > ‘baptizing’.

‖ Лексика 168. Low tone in Jpn. does not correspond to Kor. (but cf. different dialectal variants). The root must have denoted some small rodent, possibly a flying squirrel (which could explain the meaning ‘bat’ in Turkic). One should also mention PM *ǯaraɣa ‘hedgehog, porcupine’ = Karakh. jarpuz ‘mongoose’, possibly derived from the same root. A different etymology of the Turkic word (comparing it with Evk. ńarbakin ‘naked’ and deriving from a *ńarV ‘naked skin’, see Stachowski 1999) seems less likely to us.

Despite the meaning of the Chuvash form (“up”) the Turk. root should be rather compared with this Korean and Japanese data than with Mong. degde- ‘rise’ etc. (see VEWT 194 with literature). On the latter root see under *tēga.

◊ ЭСТЯ 4, 219, Лексика 157. The Turkic form is analysed as ‘road panther’ which is most probably a folk etymology (under the influence of the borrowed bars ‘panther’): even if one takes jol with a secondary late attested meaning ‘line, stripe’, shortness of -oin Turkm. contradicts the etymology (*jōl ‘road’ has a long vowel).

PTurk. *iler- to be dimly visible (быть смутно видимым): Karakh. iler- (MK); Oyr. eles ‘silhouette, ghost’, eleste- ‘be dimly visible’.
◊ EDT 150. The form attested in MK cannot be a mongolism (primarily for semantic reasons); however, Mong. ilere- also cannot be a Turkism, being rather derived from Mong. ile. Modern Turkic forms - Tuva ilere-, Oyr. iler- ‘to become visible’ are obvious late mongolisms.
PJpn. *àràp-ar- to appear (появляться): OJpn. arap-ar-a-; MJpn. àràf-ar-a-; Tok. arawaré-; Kyo. áráwáré-; Kag. arawaré-.
◊ JLTT 677. The Kagoshima accent is aberrant (type B would be expected). The stem *àràpà- is also attested in *àràpà-s- ‘to express, cause to appear’.
‖ The Karakh. form is isolated, but borrowing is hardly possible here.
≠ile to drive: Tung. *ilbe-; Mong. *ileɣe-; Turk. *ẹl-t-, *ẹl-č-.

*ùjŋula - *úle 615
postulate the original meaning in Mong. as “opposite” (see TMN 1, 168-169), then included it into his list of Mong.>Tung. borrowings (Doerfer MT 25): both positions are certainly untenable. However, the Turkic and Japanese reflexes here are not devoid of problems. The Turkic reflex reveals an exceptional preservation of *u- as jü- (regularly *ɨg- would be expected) - which may be explained by the inner Turkic confusion of the synonymous roots *jüg- and *jok- ( < *ŋṑk ̔è q.v.). The Japanese match can be (and has been traditionally) explained as a compound of *u- ‘top’ with *pa (*ba) ‘place’ (v. sub *bga). However, in case of a compound we would rather expect *u-m-pa. It should be also noticed that the form *úpa- itself is very frequent as a first component of compounds, while the root *ú- alone is never attested. This all may mean that the Japanese form actually reflects a different root (with a medial labial consonant), or a merger of PA *ugu with some different root. Such a root may be perhaps discovered in TM (*ebu-ri‘to lift, raise’, see ТМС 2, 471) and Mong. (Kh. övx- ‘to rise’), with a provisional reconstruction of PA *ébu.

◊ ТМС 1, 359 (the verb *kadala- ‘to regulate, oppress’ reflected in several languages is derived from the noun ‘bridle’ rather than borrowed from Mong., where *kada- means basically ‘to nail’; however, there were vast possibilities of contaminating the original and borrowed roots (see under *kājt ̔a). Nan. χadara ‘bridle’ may be borrowed from Mong.

◊ JLTT 441 (’head; chief’). The word means ‘head’ (also ‘head part’, ‘chief part’) in most modern and Middle Japanese sources (explicitly so in Wamyōshō); KKJ (p. 232) also lists the meaning ‘hair of head’ (attested in Tosa Nikki), obviously secondary, with a rather natural semantic transition. IKJ (p. 297) glosses the word as “denoting the whole head including the hair and face”, as opposed to kaube ( = kami-be) denoting only the top of the head and to atama “fontanelle”. The only clear OJ (Man’yōshū 4346) example (kasira kakinade...) may be well translated (and usually is translated) as ‘stroking the head’. Therefore the idea (see Vovin 2000) that the original meaning of kasira was ‘hair of head’ (the meaning that was always expressed in Japanese as kami) is most certainly wrong - just as his attempt to link it with the rather obscure Old Korean 麻帝核試 (MC mạ-tìej-xäik-śì)  ̔hair of head’. The latter should be probably read as [məri-ɣak-si], where məri- is  ̔head’, while -ɣak-si may stand for kark-[si] - with kark- being identical to MKor. kārki  ̔mane’, modern məri-kharak  ̔hair of head’. Despite the uncertainty of Old Korean readings in general and of -si in Old Korean -ɣak-si, it seems much more reasonable to link the Old Korean and later Korean sources than to invent a new Old Korean word *kasi  ̔hair’ and compare it with a wrongly interpreted Old Japanese word.
PKor. *kór(čhí) brain, marrow (мозг): MKor. kor, kór-čhí; Mod. kol.
◊ Nam 51, KED 156. The meaning ‘head’ in modern dialects proves that the original meaning was ‘brain, head’ (in literary Korean the word usually means ‘marrow’ while ‘brain’ is expressed as məri-k:ol, lit. “head brain”). The meaning ‘marrow’ may have been additionally induced by the analogy with kol-su (MKor. kor-sju) ‘bone marrow’, borrowed from MC 骨髓 kot-sjwé; but Kor. *kor itself has of course nothing to do with MC kot ‘bone’.
‖ KW 163, Poppe 17 (Doerfer TMN 3, 479: “aus phonetischen Gründen unsicher”). The meaning ‘head’ in Kor.-Jpn. (whence ‘brain’ in Kor.) is secondary, with a universally usual semantic shift ( < ‘bald spot’; cf. Slavic *golъ ‘bare, naked’ and *golva ‘head’ etc.; see Фасмер 1, 429). -čhí in MKor. may either reflect the variation of the reflexes of *-ĺǯ- (it is interesting to note also MKor. kắrčhjŋ ‘young skin of a plant’, which may actually reflect the same root), or a compound with -čhi ‘stuff, thing’.

The sources available to us, however, only give the meaning ‘luck, grace’ (see L 460, KW 233 etc.) which is absent in Turkic. Therefore the word is hardly borrowed < Turkic.

qatɨ◊r. VEWT 242, ЭСТЯ 5, 339-340, TMN 3, No 1395. The Turkic form may well be borrowed < Iran., cf. Saka khaḍara- ‘mule’. Here -ḍ- points to *rd, cf. Sogd. ɣrtr’k < *xarataraka ‘mule’ (for a quite similar compound cf. Pers. astar ‘mule’ < *assa-tara ‘horse from one side’(Bailey 70). Doerfer is concerned about lack of length in Turkic, but length is likewise lacking in Saka and other Iranian forms. The only phonetic difficulty is the Turkic reflex -t-, because Saka ḍ in the Saka-Uygh. glossary (14th c.) renders Turkic -r-. In one obvious Saka loan the Saka -ḍ- is indeed rendered as -r-: cūḍām ‘stadium’ (Av. čarətu-) > OT (Hap. by MK) čurām ‘a shot with a light far-flying arrow. However, if ‘mule’ is borrowed, it is hardly a Xinjiang loanword but rather a Common Turkic, and perhaps from another Iranian language (Sogdian?).
‖ A Western isogloss. Mong. > Chag. kačir ‘mule’ etc. (see VEWT 217). The Mong. form itself may have been borrowed from Turk. (see Щербак 1997, 137), but may as well be genuine. The Tung. parallel makes the theory of Turk. < Iran. (Sogd. ɣrtr’k, see TMN 3, 393 with literature) rather improbable.

◊ VEWT 228, ЭСТЯ 5, 161, Лексика 199-200. An extremely complicated case: forms meaning ‘eyelid’ are traditionally analysed as derived from *Kap- ‘to cover’ - but the Turkm., Uzb. and Uygh. forms clearly contradict such a derivation by displaying unmistakable vowel length. A trace of the original meaning ‘forehead, eyebrow’ (later shifted to ‘eyelid’) in the Kypchak languages (not distinguishing vowel length) may be found in expressions meaning ‘to frown (one’s forehead, eyebrows)’: Kirgh. qabaq tüj-, bürkö-, Kaz., KKalp. qabaq tüj-. The form *Kāpak may have been additionally influenced by PT *Kāp ‘sack; to surround’ (v. sub *k[ā]p ̔á), *Kāp(ak) ‘caul, hymen’ (v. sub *k ̔āp ̔a). The variation of *-m- and -p- (cf. the archaic Siberian reflexes with -m-) is parallelled by a similar variation in TM and Japanese and may reflect an original cluster, but may have been an innovation due to the contaminations with *Kap- and *Kāp.

Kirgh. kendik ‘room for grain, fuel’ (may be < Pers.); Chuv. kandi ‘round wooden bowl’.
◊ EDT 729. Clauson regards the word as an unequivocal iranism. The Iranian forms are: Pekhl. kndwg ( > Armen. k’andouk), Pers. kandū, kandūk ‘big earthenware vessel for storing grain’, Osset. xaendyg ‘pail for pickled cheese’. Persian is the source of Syr. kndwk-, Arab. kandūǯ ‘big vessel for grain’. Also related is Sak. khadīrakya (*xandīra-) ‘a vessel’ (possibly, some basket-work, see Bailey 71, Аб. 4, 173). Abayev derives the above forms from Iran. *kan- ‘to dig’ - which is not quite plausible (in a participle we would expect the zero grade vocalism; unclear is the labial vowel in the suffix; semantics raises doubts). On the other hand, all the above Iranian forms can be well explained as Turkisms, including the Saka form - with the suffix -rak (a wellknown suffix for receptacles, see Bang 1918). External parallels provide the final support for such a decision. Middle Greek kóndü ‘potrion’ may be < Bulg., cf. the Chuv. semantics (see Фасмер sub кандия; cf. also other European words possibly having the same source).

832
‖ See АПиПЯЯ 286, Цинциус 1984, 96-97, Дыбо 316, Лексика 243, 245. The comparison is quite reliable phonetically; *-jl- has to be assumed to account for the development in Kor. ( > -i-). The semantic side (’arm’/’leg’/’thigh’) can be explained if we suppose that the word originally designated a part of the animal body (front or hind leg together with the thigh). Cf. also ТМ *xūl-kse ‘sleeve’ (probably an original derivation, although the length is not clear), *xul-ŋsi ‘shank, shin’, PT *Koltuk ‘armpit’ (Лексика 243, TMN 3, 557-558, ЭСТЯ 6, 52-54). It is interesting to speculate on the subject of the identity Kor. *kūi-mrí = Jpn. kuru-(n)pusi. In Kor. -mrí is certainly to be analysed as “head” (*’leg-head’); the Jpn. form in this case may reflect a dissimilation < *kuru-n-musi, where *musi could be the remnant of PA *mĺǯu ‘head’ (q.v.). The same element in fact may be also present in Jpn. *tu(m)pu-(n)pusi ‘ankle, knee’ and *kəmpusi (if, with haplology < *kəmpu-(n)pusi) ‘fist’. One has, of course, to reckon with the possibility of having here rather PJ *pusi ‘joint’ ( < PA *bĺi q.v.), which would explain the constant emergence of a stop in Jpn.; but the Jpn.-Kor. match (*kūi-mrí = kuru(n)pusi) seems to be not accidental.

◊ Nam 455, KED 1679. The Kirim transcription 黑根 MC [xʌk-kʌn] may represent either *hɨkɨ- (as believed by Lee 1991, Ramsey 1993 and Vovin 2000) or *hkɨ- = *khɨ- < *kɨh-, keeping in mind the general uncertainty of Kirim transcriptions.
‖ The meaning ‘big’ in Korean certainly derives from *’plentiful’. The match between Kor. khɨ- and Jpn. *kk- appears quite satisfactory, despite the attempt of Vovin (2000) to link Kor. *hɨkɨ- with PJ *sùkùnà‘few’: it is hardly possible to analyse the Jpn. word as *’big’-does-not-exist, since all the existing compounds of this type are “noun+-na”, not “adjective+-na”, and anyway it is hardly possible to

The attribution of some forms is problematic: Turk. *Kulmay reflect a partial contamination with PA *gŭldo ‘to stretch’ (q.v.).; the Jpn. and Kor. forms, due to the merger of *r and *l, can actually also reflect PA *kṓr[i] q.v.; in Jpn. cf. also koro ‘round log’, korog- ‘to roll, rotate’.

‖ The root probably denoted a small field bird (grouse or hazel-hen); the meaning  ̔hawk’ in the Turkic derivative is obviously <  ̔the one hunting grouses’.

One wonders if Kor. nokočiri is not in fact one of Mongolian loanwords (since a hazel-hen, grouse or lark are good prey for a falcon, it may have been borrowed together with other falcon-hunt words); a form like *nugtɨrū (cf.

In Егоров 160, Федотов 1, 431 the Chuv. form is regarded as a variant of pexil ‘blessing’ ( < Pers.), which is insecure phonetically. Derivation from bele’swaddle’ (Clark 1977, 132) is highly dubious. The labialized vowel in Bashk., Tat. is a result of contamination with *bölek ‘part’.

The cluster *-jĺ- has to be reconstructed to account for the loss of resonant in Korean (*-h is a trace of a velar suffix: *najĺV-gV). It could be also interesting to mention a verb attested in MJpn.: neba- ( < *nai-(m)pa-) ‘to grow old; to become grown up’ - perhaps with an irregular loss of -s(that would be an expected reflex of *-ĺ-) in a cluster. The root should be distinguished from *ńāĺ(b)a ‘young’ q.v. (which, however, certainly influenced the Turkic reflex - whence an irregular long vowel).

The Manchu word could be derived from MMong. nekun ‘servant’ (see Rozycki 161), on which see *nk ̔e, but may as well be derived from *neku, with its meaning being a result of confusing the two roots.

‖ Martin 240, Дыбо 10, Robbeets 2000, 104. The root denotes some sort of wild-growing flower (clover, dandelion, shepherd’s purse), but as most plant names - raises some problems. Mong. nimniɣa must represent a transformation of *nin-miɣa, with not quite clear suffixation. The tone correspondence between Kor. and Jpn. is irregular. If the original Turk. form is *jor-ɨnčka (cf. (QB) jor “porridge” - a semantic derivation like Russ. кашка ‘clover’?), it does not belong here. On the other hand, cf. PT *jandak ‘name of a thorny plant, camel-thorn, thistle’ (EDT 947, VEWT 185). It appears semantically distant from the other forms, but may represent a secondary development due to association with jan- ‘burn’ (’burning plant’). The reconstruction in this case would have to be changed to *nuńa - better explaining consonant reflexes and Mong. vocalism, but also suggesting a secondary restructuring in Turkic (*jɨn-dak > *jan-dak).

‖ Дыбо 1995b (Mong.-Tung.). The semantic interchange between ‘teeth’ and ‘sprouts’ is quite common, so in this respect the etymology seems plausible. In Jpn. one has to suppose a suffixed form *ma(i) < *ńằjl(a)-gV; medial *-j- is reconstructed to account for the loss of resonant in Kor. The root seems to be unattested in Turkic, but cf.

◊ Егоров 344, Мудрак Дисс. 85, VEWT 31. If we exclude obvious loans from Mong. adqu-, all the other forms clearly fall into two types. 1) PT *ạtɨm ‘handful, pinchful’ 2) PT *Atkɨ- ‘smth. hitched, clutching, clinging’. The latter (Tuva atkak) is linked in EDT 47 with OUygh. atqaq ‘vikalpa’. There is a number of OUygh. Buddhist terms that can be derived from a stem meaning ‘grasp, hitch’: atqaq ‘1) vikalpa, attachment to the material world (whence borrowed in Mong. atqaɣ ‘illusion, prejudice’), 2) viṣaya, ‘idea, notion, subject’, atqaq-lɨɣ ‘appertaining to smth.’, atqa-n- ‘be connected, clinging to (the material world)’, atqa-nč-sɨz ‘devoid of sense perceptions’, atqanɣu ‘viṣaya’, atqanɣu-luɣ ‘correlated’ (cf. (alquqa) atqanɣuluɣ tutǯaqlɨɣ ‘correlated (with everything) (and) grasping (everything)’), see ДТС 68, EDT 47. This all seems to indicate a primary root *ạt- meaning both ‘to cling, hitch on to smth., grasp’ and ‘a grasp, handful’ (also ‘armful’ if we take into account the Chuv. meaning). Note that in Siberian languages this root (*ạt-ka-k) is additionally confused with the local word for ‘gills’ - which has a quite separate Altaic origin (see under *p ̔átà(kV) ‘fish fin’).

◊ OJ si is not frequent and is sometimes hard to distinguish from the deictic / emphatic particle si; however, there are several text examples firmly identifying its function as a 2d p. pronoun. It is used parallelly with the far more frequent na, but never occurs in compounds or with suffixes -re or -no; it is thus probable that it originally functioned as the direct stem as opposed to na as the oblique stem in a suppletive paradigm. See more detailed discussion in Murayama 1950, Miller JOAL and Itabashi 1998 (pace the latter author, however, we must say that the coincidence of si ‘thou’ and si  ̔deictic / emphatic pronoun and particle’ must be just a coincidence).

Hypotheses about the Chinese origin of the word (KW 331, Дмитриева 166-167) are hardly grounded: one has to suppose Chin. > Mong., with a secondary addition of the Mong. plant suffix -gina, with a subsequent borrowing Mong. > Turkic (which is hardly plausible because of old attestation within Turkic); the Manchu parallel also speaks against borrowing from Chinese. See also notes on *sugu ‘weed’ (there may have been some confusion of these two roots in Kor.-Jpn. and in Turkic).

‖ The Kor. form is a secondary derivative from an unattested verb *sàn-hă-, which explains the “verbal” low tone (although the -a-vowel is not quite expected, possibly - a dissimilation from *sằn-hă-). The Jpn. meaning is obviously secondary (“hunting” > “fishing”).

Despite Räsänen borrowed from Mong. can be only Yak. čakɨr ‘white (of a horse)’ (cf. also Dolg. čakɨr, see Stachowski 72), and perhaps the front-row forms (Kirgh. čekir, Kaz. šegir, KKalp. šegir - because of their restriction to the Kypch. area); but Mong.. čakir / čekir ‘whitish’ is itself an obvious Turkism (see TMN ibid., Clark 1977, 134 with doubts). The root should be distinguished from nasalized forms: Oyr. čaŋqɨr, Chuv. senker, Yak. čeŋgir, ǯeŋgir, Kirgh. čenkil, čaŋɨl with the same set of meanings (’whitish, blue’, often of eyes) = Mong. (Khalkha) cenxer id.; those should be compared with Tokh. A, B tsem ‘blue (of eyes)’, Pers. zangār ‘verdigris’, whence Tat. zäŋgär (from Pers. zang ‘rust’, further derived with *zā’to leave, remain’, Sak. ysāyä ‘rust’, Osset. zgä, see Bailey 348-349).

The Turkic form deserves special comment: Ramstedt 1924 derived it from *tüke-  ̔be exhausted’ (see under *t ̔ukì), i.e. “being exhausted, having come to an end” = “is not”. The semantic derivation seems quite probable, but PT *degül is phonetically not derivable from *tüke-; it appears rather to be derived from an otherwise unattested PT *degü- < PA *tagi, but with the same semantic shift. There is yet another possibility available: regarding -(ü)l in Turkic as a remnant of the negative particle = PM *ülü  ̔not’, i.e. *degül = “not filled, incomplete”.

‖ Дыбо 46. A Western isogloss. The old meaning of the Turk. form can be reconstructed on the basis of the Mong. loanword tašaɣa ‘hip’ (Khalkha tašā(n) ‘hip, thigh; piece inserted between cloth laps’, Bur. tašān ‘hip, side’, Kalm. tašā id., Ord. dašā id., but Mongor tašaG ‘scrotum’), see Дыбо 1992. The Turkic form is sometimes derived from *diāĺ ‘stone’, with a semantic parallel in Finn. kivi ‘stone’ - kives ‘testiculi’; let us note, however, both a phonetic discrepancy (*diāĺ ‘stone’ has voiced *d- and a long vowel), as well as a semantic inconclusiveness: Finnish kives is a diminutive with the first meaning “plummet on a net”, whence metaphorically “testicle”, whereas no “plummet” or “sinker” meanings are attested anywhere in Turkic.

‖ The Jpn. diphthong is not quite clear. It is interesting also to mention Turkic data: cf. Karakh. tolun in tolun aj ‘full moon’ (MK, see EDT 501), with tolun formally being a participle from *dol- ‘to be filled’, but in fact used only in this phrase in the sense of “full moon”. Modern



*t ̔oŋe - *t ̔op ̔è

Turkish has dolunaj ‘full moon’ with d- (just as in dol- ‘be filled’), but the verb tolun- ‘to become full (of moon)’ - which would correspond quite regularly to PA *t ̔ṑlo.

Not quite clear is the position of several forms: WMong. tos- ‘to receive, encounter’ (maybe, following Clark 1980, 41 < Turk. *dūĺ- ‘to meet’ although the latter is certainly borrowed as WMong. tus- ‘to hit upon, fall to one’s share’, so this would be a somewhat unusual etymological doublet); Manchu tusu- ‘to marry, celebrate marriage’ (could be a Mong. loanword, but the semantics is strikingly different). Finally there is MKor. tsk- ‘to love, like’.

Illich-Svitych (ОСНЯ 1, ХV) regards Mong. sara as a prosodic variant of sira- ‘yellow’, which is hardly the case.

If the Jpn. word is indeed to be analysed as *sa- ‘early spring’ (+ *tukui ‘month’, ‘moon’), then its original meaning must have been ‘(beginning of a new) moon cycle, season’ - cf. the meaning ‘season’ in Kor. and TM, and especially ‘beginning of the year’ in Kor. (note that TM *sē biaga has also the meaning ‘first month of the year’ > Manchu se-bija, Jurch. sei-bi(a)ha, see the discussion in Lee 1958).

Clauson (EDT 975) and Doerfer (TMN 1, 555-557) follow Ramstedt KW 219 and regard the Turkic forms as borrowed < Mong., which is somewhat dubious because of the peculiar phonology of Mong. josun (words with *jo- are extremely rare in Mong.). PT *josuk (*josak) also strengthens the thesis about the Turkic origin of Mong. josun; Doerfer’s hypothesis that Tat. josuq, Oyr. jozaq etc. reflect a contamination of *jasak and *josun is not very plausible (*jasak has usually a quite different meaning ‘impost, tax’ etc.), and there is also a completely unexplained (as a Mongolism) form Oyr., Tel. jozor.
