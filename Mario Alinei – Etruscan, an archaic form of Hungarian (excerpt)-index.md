Etruscan: an archaic form of Hungarian
(book summary)
by Mario Alinei
The Hungarian translation of my book Etrusco: una forma arcaica di ungherese, il Mulino, Bologna, 2003, has been published by ALL PRINT Kiadó, Budapest, 2005, with the
title: Ancient link: the Magyar-Etruscan linguistic relationship



2
In the two volumes reproduced in the following figure, which came out respectively in 1996 and 2000, I have illustrated the Palaeolithic Continuity Theory (PCT) on Indo-European, Uralic and Altaic languages. This theory has been advanced independently, and/or is at present followed by such scholars as the Belgian prehistorian Marcel Otte (Un. of Liège), the German archaeologist Alexander Häusler (Univ. of Halle), the French linguist Jean Le Du (Univ. of Brest), the Spanish linguist Xaverio Ballester (Univ. of Valencia), the Italian linguists Gabriele Costa (Univ. of Terni), Francesco Benozzo (Univ. of Bologna), Franco Cavazza (Univ. of Bologna) and others. The main point of the PCT is that Indo-European, Uralic and Altaic people belong to the groups of Homo sapiens who have populated Eurasia since Palaeolithic times.



3
The PCT has an important predecessor in the URALIC CONTINUITY THEORY (uralilainen jatkuvuusteoria), currently accepted by the great majority of Uralic linguists and archaeologists. According to this theory Uralic populations belonged to the groups of Homo sapiens sapiens who had settled in Europe in Palaeolithic times. They were thus already in Eastern Europe during the last Glacial (13.000 b.C.), and moved to the North at the time of the deglaciation (9.000 b.C.), in order to continue their culture of specialized hunters and fishermen (see figure).
Following this scenario the Magyars, together with the other Ugric groups, must have settled in the area of the Ob river, thus forming the south-easternmost group of the Finno-Ugrians



4
The present distribution of all Uralic languages (see figure), except Magyar, perfectly corresponds to the scenario reconstructed by the Uralic Continuity Theory. The only problem, as is known, is that of the Honfoglalás (‘homeland occupation’) of the Magyars, who at a time which has not yet been establish with certainty, must have separated from the other Ugric people and moved from the Ob river area to their historical territory. The new PCT offers a new solution for this problem and, at the same time, the elements for a demonstration of the identity of the prehistoric Magyars with the ancient Etruscans.



5
The new solution offered by the PCT for the problem of the Honfoglalás is the following: (A) ALTAIC (TURKIC and MONGOLIAN) populations were in Central Asia already in Palaeolithic times. (B) When, in the 4th millennium b.C., the first cultures of HORSE-RIDING WARLIKE NOMADS emerge in the steppes of Western Asia, we are already confronted with Turkic people. (C) All warlike nomadic groups which in the course of prehistory and history follow one another along the Eurasiatic steppes (see figure) are ALTAIC, with the single exception of later and intrusive Iranians, coming from their homeland in SouthWestern Asia. (D) The HUNGARIAN PUSZTA, western end of the Eurasiatic steppes, represents the natural outlet of all the warlike nomadic groups coming from East.
The STEPPE AREA, from Mongolia to Hungary (not on the map), which was the ecological niche for the blossoming and the spread of ALTAIC nomadic cultures in prehistory, proto-history and history.

Eurasiatic nomadic cultures begin – by definition - with horse-riding. And horse-riding emerges in the steppe area, in the 4th millennium, within the so called Serednyi Stog (= SS) culture, which as we have argued must be assumed as TURKIC. From the SS culture there develops, in the 3rd millennium, the more famous kurgan or Yamnaia (= Y) culture, which must also be assumed as TURKIC.
We must now recall that the MAGYAR terminology for HORSE and HORSE RIDING is TURKIC of origin, and is shared by the OB-UGRIC languages.
This has fundamental implications for the DATING OF THE UGRIC UNITY:
(1) MAGYAR AND OB-UGRIC LANGUAGES must have been still united in their western central Asiatic territory in the 4th and 3rd millennium, when the



8
first HORSE-RIDING TURKIC CULTURES developed in the steppe area, to the South of their settlement. (2) They must have been very much influenced by them, also culturally.



9
Most of the POLITICAL, SOCIAL and AGRICOLTURAL TURKIC (especially CHUVASH) LOANWORDS in MAGYAR, however, ARE NOT SHARED BY OB-UGRIC LANGUAGES.
In turn, this implies that the Magyars, AFTER their separation from the other Ob-Ugric languages, must have undergone a SECOND WAVE OF TURKIC INFLUENCES.
When did the SEPARATION of the Magyars from the Ob-Ugrians then take place?
As ARCHAEOLOGY informs us, at the end of the 3° millennium b.C. a KURGAN group invaded Hungary during the ‘classic’ period of the BADEN culture. As this is the only archaeologically well-attested episode of invasion of the Hungarian territory, we have no alternative as to the conclusion that it was this group, probably TURKIC CHUVASH, which caused the separation of the Magyars from the other Ugric people, at the same time acculturating and guiding them to the Honfoglalás, the conquest of their historical territory.
The Honfoglalás at the end of the 3rd millennium, in the light of the TCP



10
Moreover, as in the light of the PCT the kurgan culture must be assumed as TURKIC, and the Baden culture as SLAVIC, this would explain why Magyar has so many TURKIC LOANWORDS NOT SHARED BY THE OTHER UGRIC (AND URALIC) LANGUAGES, as well as so many SLAVIC PLACE NAMES.



11
WHY WERE ETRUSCANS MAGYAR?
(1) ARCHAEOLOGY, since the years Seventies, has concluded that the ancestors of the Etruscans, the so called VILLANOVIANS (from the name of the Central-Italian culture of VILLANOVA, of the beginning of the 1st millennium) came from the Carpato-Danubian area. The archaeologist who has contributed the most to this discovery is the American Hugh Hencken. (2) The Villanovians and their predecessors Proto-Villanovians were characterized, among other things, by cremation. Cremation originated in central Europe with the so called Urn Fields. The earliest Urn Fields in central Europe are the Hungarian ones (Hencken). (3) Moreover, Carpato-danubian influences on Italian prehistory began much earlier: (A) Starting from the 3RD MILLENNIUM, Italian prehistory sees “an almost continuous presence of central-European influences” (Barfield). (4) In the 2ND MILLENNIUM, the so called Bronze Age “Terremare” in the Po Valley (Emilia), and the artificial hills of Bronze Age settlements in the Danube plain (e.g. Tószeg) are “remarkably similar” (Barfield). (5) Archaeological evidence for Carpato-Danubian influences on the prehistory of Northern Italy is actually such as to make one think of an “ACTUAL INVASION ... of the Po Valley by people coming from East”(Barfield, cf. Cardarelli).
OBBLIGATORY CONCLUSION: In the light of the PCT, the Carpato-Danubian people who exercised so much influence on northern Italy in the course of the 3rd and 2nd millennium, and who became the Villanovians of the 1st millennium, can only be the heirs of the conquerors of Hungary in the 3rd millennium, that is Magyars who had been accultured by Turkic élites.

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TURKIC ROLE IN
THE PREISTORY OF THE MAGYARS AND –AS
WILL BE SHOWN - OF THE ETRUSCANS
Hugh Hencken, the main scholar of the Proto-Etruscan culture of Villanova, has advanced the hypothesis that in the 2nd millennium b.C. the Etruscans – who were called TYRSENOI by the Greeks – from the Carpato-Danubian region might have reached the eastern Mediterranean, and could thus be identified with the TURSHA, one of the famous SEA PEOPLE struggling for the control of Mediterranean Sea and mentioned by ancient Egyptians.
This hypothesis has been recently strengthened by the discovery that the language of the inscriptions of the island of Lemnos in the Egean Sea is also Etruscan.
Indipendently from Hencken’s reasearch on Etruscan, also HUNGARIAN ARCHAEOLOGISTS (e.g. Tibor Kovács) have advanced the hypothesis that ‘2nd millennium Magyars’ might have participated in the ventures of the SEA PEOPLE.
The LATIN NAMES for the Etruscans, namely TUSCI (< TU(R)SCI), ETRUSCI (< ETURSCI), ETRURIA (< ETRUSIA < ETURSIA), as well as the Greek one TYRSENOI, could thus be connected with the name of the TURKS, anticipating the long series of TURKIC OR ALTAIC NAMES that have been given to the Magyars in history: HUNGARIANS, AVARS, TURKS, BASHKIRS, HUNS.
The ‘birth’ of the Etruscans – that is of PREHISTORIC MAGYARS WHO INVADED ITALY AND WERE
CONSIDERED AS TURKS, – would then have taken place in the Bronze Age, when the Carpato-Danubian area became “the industrial heart of Europe” (Barfield) and Hungarian metallurgy, after reaching its zenith, started off a wave of expansion campaigns of the Magyars.



13
As we shall see, many Etruscan terms, especially those of a social and political kind, correspond to the Hungarian ones with a Turkic origin (e.g. gyula, kende).
ETRUSCAN LANGUAGE:
which results have been reached by modern
Etruscology with regards to Etruscan?
Modern Etruscology, with regards to linguistics, has been called ‘combinatorial’ or ‘hermeneutic’, because it has concentrated on the study of the INTERNAL characters of the language, as well as on its relations with the material and cultural context, without the hazards of the attempts to connect Etruscan with one or another language. Therefore its results, when they have been reached on the base of irrefutabile evidence, can be considered as very important.
The conclusions of
‘combinatorial’ Etruscology
on the main linguistic traits
of Etruscan:
Comparison with
Hungarian
It is an agglutinative language = Hungarian and Uralic Its accent is on the first vowel = Hungarian and Uralic It has vowel harmony = Hungarian and Uralic Formants, case endings and postpositions are added to the word stem
= Hungarian and Uralic
The occlusive consonants are exclusively voiceless (P T K)
= Uralic
The syllable structure is open (= it ends in vowel)
= Uralic
