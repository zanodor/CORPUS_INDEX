Preface
So why does a mild-mannered researcher and hypnotherapist, a former university professor and clinic director, get involved in such an exotic matter as the Star Kids phenomenon? Good question. As was true also in my research with experiencers of contact by the Star Visitors, I not so much went looking for the Star Kids and the Star Seeds, as they came looking for me. Let me provide you with a little background on this. The first stage of my involvement with matters cosmic began in 1989, when I began working with experiencers of Star Visitor encounters. I had been a professional psychotherapist for three decades, and thought that I had heard everything. But in 1989 I found out that I had not. That year I had four different persons seek me out for counseling about minor problems of daily living. These individuals were mentally sound and ordinary responsible citizens, one is even a recognized figure in Republican political life in my state. But after having worked with them in counseling a while, these four separate individuals decided to let down their hair a little further and tell me about contacts they had had from Star Visitors. I was jolted by their accounts of contact, but having worked with them already for a while, had already determined that they were not crackpots. Nor did they have any motivation of personal gain from telling their story to me. For everything told to a professional psychologist is confidential. There would be no attention coming to them, nor did they seek any. They told me their experiences at some perceived personal risk. Each told me they were sure that after I heard what they had to say, that I would commit them to the state mental hospital. But I did not. As it turned out, I had the background to properly assess their accounts, not only s a psychologist, but as a person who had followed the UFO phenomenon for many years. You see, I was born before there was a UFO Cover-Up. I was eight years old when I heard my parents talk about the newspaper report of a private pilot, sheriff’s deputy Kenneth Arnold, who had spotted a V-formation of round wingless craft flying near Mount Rainier, Washington State in June, 1947. Deputy Arnold dubbed them “flying saucers”, and the term stuck. Three weeks later, our daily paper and every paper in the country ,ran a front-page story that a flying saucer had been reported captured by the Army near Roswell, New Mexico. I remember thinking to myself, “Gee, that’s neat: there are other people in the universe and we’re not the only ones.” And in 1952, I was in eighth grade and reading the daily paper for myself. There was no way I could miss the big scream headlines and photos that July reporting UFOs repeatedly flying over the U.S. Capitol night after night. And how the Army Air Corps sent up fighter planes who couldn’t catch up with them. It was right after that, in 1953 that the government invented the UFO Cover-Up, and began having prominent scientists and Air Force Public Information Officers go before the press to deny and discredit UFO sighting reports. But it was too late. The seniors in our population still remember the truth from the good old days when the newspapers covered UFO sightings like any other valid news story, and had nothing to fear from the government for doing so. The second stage in my involvement with this phenomenon came in 1977. At the time I lived in Woodacre, a tiny bucolic rural village in Marin County just north of San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge. A neighbor buddy and I were hiking atop the hills above the village when I

looked up and saw a shiny metallic disc slowly skittering across the sky. We were at about 600 feet altitude and the disc was about 2000 feet above us and over slightly to the southwest, tracking a northwesterly course. I noted the direction of the wind, which was coming out of the northwest. So, clearly what I saw was not a Mylar balloon, (because the disc was tracking upwind.) I called out to my hiking companion and pointed for him to look at the disc. I commented to him, “It looks like I’ve seen my first UFO.” It was not to be my last. The third stage in my involvement with the Star Visitors occurred in 1992.
On April 12, 1992, I was proceeding west on Interstate 10 towards Deming, New Mexico in my Chevy Blazer. I had my CB radio on, listening to and talking with truckers along the way. At Deming, I turned off I-10 onto U.S. Hwy 180, heading northwest towards my destination for the night, a campground in Gila National Forest. U.S. Hwy180 is a two-lane blacktop road that goes in an almost straight line for 53 miles between Deming and Silver City, through absolutely empty and featureless Sonoran scrub desert. It's mostly flat, with an occasional gentle rise, and this night had maybe three cars on it besides mine the entire length of the road. When I left Interstate 10 at Deming, it was just after 11 p.m., on a cloudless and starry night in the pitch-black desert. As I pulled away from the Interstate, the CB audio traffic died out due to the distance. I was weary but alert enough to safely complete my drive to the campground. I estimated I would arrive by 12:30 a.m. As I settled in to this final leg of a long day's drive, I was aware that the road rose gently after about 15 miles. It was at about 11:20 p.m. I vaguely noticed a patch of bright whiteness shining in the moonlight on a rise over to the left, about 200 yards off the road. I remember vaguely considering it must be a patch of snow. (Later I realized that there could not have been snow at this lowest part of the southernmost region of the New Mexico desert.) About this time I heard a loud voice, which I at first presumed came from my CB, saying in an Arkansas twang, "Watch out for the smoke!" At first I figured that some trucker ahead of me was warning anyone about a State Trooper (“Smokey [Bear]” in CB lingo) that he had spotted. So I got on the CB and asked "Where is the Smokey?" I was surprised when I got no answer. This is the only time in my experience that a CBer failed to provide location information to follow up on a State Trooper warning. Then I noticed that the voice had seemed to have come from behind me to my left. (Later, reflecting that my CB speaker was mounted below my dash in front of me slightly to the right, I realized the voice could not have been coming out of my CB radio.) The strangeness had only begun. Almost at once I saw what looked like a huge luminous cloud of what looked like smoke stretched across the highway from the leftmost part of the rise to the rightmost part, and up to the sky, forming a solid curtain across the highway. I presumed that it was my bad luck to be running across smoke from a forest fire. So I went back on the CB to ask anyone out there, "Where's the fire? Does anyone know about the fire on US 180?" Again, the radio silence was spooky. No answer came from “Arkansas Twang” or anyone else. I started to broadcast again, then gave up lamely, since I was just about upon the presumed smoke cloud ahead stretched across the highway. . I cursed my luck, and in a few seconds calculated what a long detour I would have to drive if this fire blocked the highway, versus the risk of plowing through the smoke blindly, hoping it was just a hundred feet thick or so, so I could break through to the other side and complete my journey. I drove into the smoke, taking my foot off the gas to slow down in case I didn't pop through the other side quickly. I didn't. Not for an hour. The smoke seemed to be coming off what I thought was a hillside to the left of me. I couldn't see the road, the center line or anything. So I came to a stop. (Later, in hypnotic recall, I noted that there were no trees or brush burning, no blackened or charred chaparral, and that the "smoke" had no odor! Nor was this fog, not in the Springtime sea-level bone-dry Sonoran desert with the air temperature nowhere near the dew point.) I sat defeated in my car, stopped in the right lane of U.S. 180 in the middle of nowhere. The greyish-white vapor did not dissipate. So I got out, walked across the road to the left shoulder, towards where the ground rose slightly up, disoriented in the cloud. I got the impression that there were low scrub pinon pines spaced apart in the vapor. I stepped across a little ditch at the edge of the road and walked towards these "pinon pines," then stopped, unable to see ahead. (I presumed there were pinon pines there, but a friend who later re-drove that road told me there were none on that
3



stretch.) Then I went into a state of paralysis. I could not move my body. I sensed the approach of two persons, who got on either side of me and each placed a firm grip on my forearms. I cannot recall actually viewing them. The funny thing about their hands was that theirs was a three-fingered grip. Their fingers were long and didn't feel like human fingers. They did not have articulated bones, but instead felt like there was continuous cartilage inside with a padded fleshy exterior. The grip consisted of two fingers on top of my forearm and one finger underneath. The fingers were not much wider than human ones but quite long. And their grip was like a vise. It was clear I was going with them. Frankly, I had no better idea, anyway. I was led forward and to the left, in the general direction of what I had originally presumed was the "snow patch" gleaming in the moon- light. Soon we arrived at a landed metallic vehicle. I stopped about five feet in front of the midpoint of its long side. It was shaped like a flattened arch, with rounded ends. The bottom seemed more flat, but that may be because it was partially sunk into the sand. It was a metallic color, about the color of Airstream trailers, only not so bright. The length I would estimate at 35-50 feet and the height at midpoint at 10-12 feet. A rectangular opening appeared in the side of the craft. Next thing I remember, (my memories are somewhat disjointed), I’m sitting back in a chair in a room inside the craft, feeling spacey and numb. I gradually realized that I was alone; they had left. The lighting in there was subdued. The air inside was of sort of a neutral temperature, not sharply cold like the desert night air. It smelled stale, like the recycled air you encounter in an airliner during a trans-continental flight. After awhile they came back. The one who had the stronger grip when we met, the one on my right, felt like a male presence. As he came back in, I had a quick glimpse of his face. He had a roundish oval face with two large horizontally ovoid black eyes that did not slant or wrap around the side. No irises or pupils, just black all the way across the eye. I did not notice a nose, and got more of an impression than a view of a mouth. I did not clearly see, but got the impression of a thin torso and limbs. His height I would estimate at five feet. He seemed placid, sort of matter-of-fact. He was definitely not human, but unmistakably an intelligent life form. The other Star Visitor had had a gentler yet still firm grip on my left forearm when we encountered. The feeling was of a lighter, gentler persona, possibly a female. I was escorted into another room, which was also dimly lit, and placed in a reclining position, something like the posture one has in a dentist's or astronaut's chair. I felt a buzzing, stimulating, resonating sensation in the triangular area defined by the tops of my eyebrows and the bridge of my nose, and focused about a quarter-inch inward from skin surface. (This is a sensation I would become quite familiar with in the days and months ahead. It has heralded and accompanied subsequent Star Visitor contacts.) I experienced a sense of pressure in my nose, as if a small object was being introduced into my nasal passages or even a little higher. (Afterwards for four or five days I had a sense of excessive pressure there, along with a feeling of light buzzing resonance and pressure in my head that was almost like a headache, but not quite.) Next, I had a sensation of the release of restraints around my ankles. These restraints were not physical restraints, but more of an immaterial, force-field kind. I understood that the Star Visitors were done, and I was free to go. I got up. The next segment of the event I remember is being outside the craft in the night air floating horizontally towards my vehicle. After that I became aware of being behind the wheel, driving below the speed limit, the "vapor" dissipating, and I'm breaking out of the "smoke cloud" and resuming my drive northwest up U.S. 180. I continued my trip to the Gila National Forest campground, where I camped for the night. When I woke up the next morning, I had no memory of my Close Encounter. But I did notice four odd things. I had a strange fullness and pressure feeling in my upper nasal passage area and a dull, almost headache-like symptoms I had never had before. I wrote it off to fatigue. As I put on my socks I also noted that there were two tiny scoop marks side-by-side on top of my right great toe, each like a shallow crater that you could rest the base of a BB in. I was startled, because I am no stranger to the body-marks literature of extraterrestrial encounters, which includes scoop marks from tissue sampling. But denial set in, and I said to myself, "Nah, that can't be that!" Then I reflected that I had arrived at the campground at least an hour after my estimated time; and on the open roads of New Mexico, where a minute can equal a mile, I had become quite precise at calculating traveling time. Lastly, I noticed, with curiosity, that overnight my attitude towards
4



extraterrestrials had changed. Gone was the gripping fear that I had felt since having just finished reading David Jacobs's lurid book of scarey disinformation, Secret Life. Instead, I noticed that a gentle live-and-let-live attitude had settled in. And I began feeling sorry for the Star Visitors, as I considered the monumental Star Wars weapons crash program aimed at them that I had seen on this trip around classified government installations in the Southwest. I also reflected on my own research into cases I had interviewed, where I found the Star Visitors to be usually caring, gentle while firm, and concerned for such values as ecology, social justice, child protection, childhood education, consciousness advancement, and a spiritual/metaphysical-focus. I noted that the experiencers of Star Visitor encounters stated that while some adult gynecological/urological procedures did seem oriented towards retrieving reproductive material, in many other instances medical and scientific procedures were oriented towards cures of diseases, genetic manipulation of ovaries or in-place fetus to create enhanced capabilities in the fetus ( future offspring) of the Experiencer, or the returning of a genetically- enhanced conceptus to the mother for completion of childbearing and child-rearing. It struck me how exaggerated and distorted David Jacobs and Budd Hopkins were with their Grey Menace tales. Instead, I found it correct to think like an anthropologist: that what we have here is a contact between civilizations. I also felt dedicated to the goal that this Contact not end up like in the movie Cool Hand Luke, where the Cracker Prison Warden drawls: "What we have here is a failure to communicate." So, a little suspicion began to curl inside my head, but I discounted it, saying to myself that the dramatic discoveries I had seen, (and was yet scheduled to view), were making me tend to overdramatize these anomalies. It was only after I returned home from the entire trip, and experienced continuing nasal pressure, quasi-headaches and uncharacteristic moodiness and edginess persist for more five days, that I reviewed everything and realized that these, too, were common psychological aftermath signs of a Close Encounter experience which has been repressed from conscious memory. At that point I made room in my mind for the possibility that I had had a close encounter of the fourth kind (with a Star Visitor.) I consulted a hypnotistpsychologist and a psychic remote-viewer to explore that strange part of my trip When the hypnotist had me smell the "smoke" and I then noticed that it had no odor, that was the final straw. I put that fact together with all the other signs common to persons who have had a close encounter, and my denial crumbled. Subsequent exploration with memory assistance sessions with a local professional using hypnosis resulted the emergence of recall of the other details which I have presented above.
In all my work with experiencers over the years since, I have noticed a pattern. The children born of experiencers tend to be extraordinary, very bright, quick to grow up, endowed with various psychic abilities, robust, good-looking, and cosmic-minded. These are the children I have come to call the Star Kids. I considered them startling, and charming. But it was not until about six years ago that this latest phase in my involvement with the Star Visitors began. It happened when I was visiting my friend, Russ, in rural, sparsely-populated Modoc County, northeastern California. Russ had invited me up to give a weekend seminar on UFOs and the Star Visitors. While I was there, I stayed in Russ’s very large, hand-built wooden house. After the Saturday segment of the seminar was over, Russ came upstair to my room to tell me something.( I had learned earlier that he had frequent visits from the Star Visitors). Russ told me that his Visitor contact had a message he wanted to be passed on to me: that I was to work with the Star Kids, and eventually set up a Star Kids School. Russ was to be of assistance. I listened carefully. This was not the first message that I have received from the Star Visitors through a human courier. But I could tell that this was a particularly important one. I was to make the Star Kids a top-priority assignment. Since I have raised four children, and worked with hundreds of others as a counselor and a teacher, I have had a lifelong love of children. But these Star Children were extraordinary. I felt it a great privilege and an extremelyserious responsibility to undertake my assignment with these special children. I gladly accepted this task.

As I go about the United States and elsewhere working with Star Kids, their parents, and Star Seed adults, people ask me, “Are you a Star Seed, too?” By way of an answer, let me do a bit of personal sharing. Late in 2003 I had occasion to talk to a close associate, certified hypnotherapist and psychic, Marian MacNeil, who assists me in working with the Star Kids. Marian has frequent visits from a Star Visitor who chooses to use the human name “Neuman”. This Visitor is an energy being, evolved past the need for a physical body. He temporarily uses the voice box of Marian to communicate with. During my contact with Marian, I asked Neuman about an encounter I had had at age 12 on the steps of the North Hollywood Post Office. Two men wearing raincoats (it was not raining) accosted me telepathically while I was ascending the Post Office steps.
The message I got from them was that they wanted me to come with them. Naturally, as a 12-year-old boy in 1951, knowing nothing of telepathy, I didn't realize what was happening: that their voices were heard only in my mind, without going through my ears. I was frightened by this confusing situation. I abandoned my bicycle on the steps, and ran from them into the Post Office. There I told the postal clerk that two men were trying to kidnap me. When I looked around through the glass entrance doors, the two men were gone. The clerk hadn’t taken me seriously, and no authorities had been summoned. So, I waited a long time, to be sure that they were gone, then ran to my abandoned bicycle, and pedaled as fast as I could home.
In response to my enquiry about this childhood episode, Star Visitor Neuman explained that these two had been Star Visitors from a planet which was dying, and that their people had become dispirited. These two men thought that if I came back with them, that this would somehow aid them by lending my intense emotional energy to them in some helpful way. But when I ran away from them, they realized that I was not going to be cooperating, and so they left. Neuman also made it clear that this was not my first Star Visitor encounter. He sais that my first encounter was in my mother’s womb, when I was just an embryo. The Star Visitors worked on my developing brain and notochord (primitive spine/neural trunk) to make certain modifications.
Neuman indicated also that over the more recent course of my life, the Star Visitors often make mental-merger contacts to provide information I would not otherwise have.
The Star Visitor also said that there is a beautiful future unfolding that is difficult for us to imagine: a beautiful place will emerge in time. “Many now struggling will no longer need to struggle then.”
Neuman encouraged me to write another book, about the Star Kids. And that is what I have set forth to do, and gladly. Such writing was indeed a pleasure.

Chapter One
Who Are The Star Kids?
If you want to see some fairly accurate examples of Star Kids, you need look no further than your local video store. The recent X-Men or X-2: X Men United movies, now in video, provide synchronistic, and perhaps not unintentional examples of art imitating life. In these two films the X-Men are a team of mutant children and grown-ups with extraordinary physical, mental and psychic abilities. These advanced humans work as peacekeepers, led by Professor Xavier, himself a mutant of high development. These mutants are assigned the task of protecting the human race against evildoers, including a rogue mutant, Magneto, who misuses his paranormal powers. The X-Men (and Women) also have to defend themselves against an archenemy, rogue Army military-intelligence Colonel Stryker, who sets out to capture these mutant pupils at their “School For the Gifted”, headed by gentle Professor Xavier.
If you were to brush aside the Hollywood hyperbole and over-dramatization, what would remain would be a roughly-accurate depiction of Star Kids’ and adult Star Kids’ advanced abilities, and a couple of aspects of their situation in contemporary society. Seem far out? The ability to read minds? To move objects by pure mental concentration? To heal by using psychic energy? Not at all. And there is more.
Additionally, in the first movie of The Matrix series, the hero, Neo (Keannu Reeves) in one scene is going to visit a psychic woman, The Oracle, for advice. As he passes through the antechambers of The Oracle’s house, Star Kids are visible at play. Two girls about eight years old are shown, one watching the other juggle alphabet blocks in the air by pure mental effort (telekinesis). In an adjoining room, a boy about their age, wearing monk’s robes and a shaven head, is shown bending a table spoon and then straightening it out, all by mental concentration only. He then goes on to give Neo/Reeves a brief philosophical lecture on the metaphysics involved in that exercise.
Only the stuff of Hollywood? Do not be so sure about that.
Newsweek magazine in its May 3, 2004 issue featured an article, “Why Don’t We Call Them Quirky?”, that describes some of the different kids now appearing among us. The article cites two Boston pediatricians, Perri Klass and Eileen Costello, who developed the term “quirky” for these kids. The article goes on to describe various “learning disorders” these young people are supposed to have. But the pediatricians see these kids as more “outside the common patterns,” and don’t want to stigmatize these kids with negative mental or learning labels. Klass and Costello, whose paperback book Quirky Kids was released the Summer of 2004, describe kids with high IQs who prefer tinkering with mechanical devices to playing with toys, and who don’t feel comfortable making friends with regular children, who teach themselves to read by age 4, and whose repertoire of skills runs the gamut from extremely gifted to clumsy. Embedded among these different children are certainly many Star Kids.
13



So what are these Star Kids? Why are these kids different? How did they happen? And why are they showing up among us now? And how come we don’t hear about this in the daily newspaper and on the Six O’Clock News?
Those are good questions. Fasten your seat belt, because the answers may amaze you.
A Star Kid may be defined as a child with both human and extraterrestrial contributions to their origin. Star Kids are predominantly human, but not entirely. They are human, but different. To be sure, they have two human biological parents, and are born here on Earth through regular childbirth. They in most ways look like other children. They come in every race, nationality, economic stratum and family background. They are citizens of Earth. But they also have an extraterrestrial component to their make-up. What this component may be varies from child to child. The extraterrestrial contribution to the child's makeup may come from: - 1) Star Visitor genes spliced into human reproductive material, (genetic engineering) during an encounter which one or both of the Star Kid’s parents had with the Star Visitors; - 2) during an encounter with the Star Visitors when the Visitors worked on an already-born child using their advanced biomedical technology, which is able to alter an already-born child or grown-up human to become more robust, psychic, super-intelligent, etc.; - 3) from a “Walk-In” situation, in which a human child who, somewhere during childhood began to die from an accident or serious illness, but the child’s departing human spirit/soul/personality was simultaneously replaced by a Star Visitor spirit/soul/personality, who came in and carried on, and completes the lifetime; - 4) during a human person’s lifetime at the point where a Star Visitor personality/consciousness comes in and shares space within the human with his own consciousness/personality as a dual, or alternating, consciousness; and, finally, - 5) in what appears to be the most prevalent way Star Kids are born, from the deliberatelychosen “missionary” incarnation of a Star Visitor into a human body to accomplish important work on Earth at this point in our history, bringing useful awareness, competencies, and advanced abilities, and lofty principles, values, and ideals to share and spread here.. One should not go around thinking that every Star Kid is fully aware of who they are or why they are the way they are. Some Star Kids do not yet remember any Star Visitor contact until a later time in their life. Or may not be aware that their parent was visited, or don’t remember or recognize when they had a Walk-In, or currently do not remember their life as a star being before the current incarnation. And so many Star Kids are not aware that they are Star Kids; they just sense that there is something profoundly different about themselves. Nevertheless, these children are special, as their sometimes bewildered and bemused parents know all too well. They often seem to be little adults in children's bodies. They often have a gaze and a knowingness that belies their years. Many years of continuing Star Visitor biological engineering in an ongoing effort to upgrade the human race have resulted in a large number of children whose heads are now often so big that a Caesarian section, or at least an episiotomy, is the only way they can be born. But even though increased cranial size is only a rough index of intelligence, even more important is the qualitative increase in human development. Such areas include: enhanced psychic abilities; the ability to harness bioenergetic (chi, prana) energy, as well as earth and cosmic forces, in order to heal; and telepathic and intuitive linking with others, and with Source Consciousness.
14



One of the most common, if mundane, characteristics of these Star Kids is that often they will cause a street lamp (especially the amber sodium-vapor type) to go out when they walk by. This is due to the influence of their body’s bioelectromagnetic field, which has been “amped-up” as a result of contact with the Star Visitors. These children often have a double handful of psychic skills, such as: telepathy (mental communication), precognition (knowing the future), telekinesis (moving objects by mental concentration), clairvoyance/remote viewing (mentally seeing things distant in space or time), "downloading" information (from off-planet consciousnesses), cross-species communication, penetrating intuitiveness (just "knowing" something without being told), affecting electrical devices (e.g., devices turn on or blow out as the kid goes by), remote-influencing others (telepathically), inter-dimensional viewing, aura-reading (learning about another's health, intentions, etc. by observing the energy field surrounding them), psychic diagnosis ("reading" the person's energy field fluctuations), psychic or bioenergetic healing (transferring helpful energy to a person), invisibility work (making oneself "invisible" (mentally), teleportation (moving self or object from one locale to another by mental effort), levitation (rising from the ground by mental effort), mental influencing (telepathically causing another to "feel" like doing something the Star Kid wants) , earth energy adjustment work, time dilation or contraction (causing events, trips, etc. to take longer or shorter time than ordinary), pre-sensitivity to earthquakes or human disasters (like car crashes), interdimensional awareness, astral (out-of-body) travel, channeling (serving as a conduit for a person not present to speak through), shared consciousness (with a Star Visitor guide), operating in close mental connection with their Star Visitor guides, and physically summoning and connecting with one's Star-Visitor and other guardians. These children carry in their bodies physical changes that they sometimes recognize, and which often are noticed by other people who are around them. Such physical changes often include: immunity improvement (most Star Kids have hardly any flus or bad colds after early childhood), and lower basal temperature (for example, instead of 98.6 degrees F, a body temperature of 96.8 F, thus meaning that the body is consumed less rapidly by metabolic forces.) These kids are also notable for their knowing gaze, mature outlook, and appealing dynamic appearance (the Star Kid look), while they most often turn out later in life to be looking younger than their years (as adult Star Seeds). These Star Kids are not just psi-savants; they recognize the importance of spiritual connection to Supreme Source in reverent consciousness. They also share spiritual insights, and are drawn to explore the connections between the physical (e.g., quartz crystal), the metaphysical (e.g., thought energy), and the spiritual (e.g., creating and transmitting through crystal amplification the intention that good happen to a person who needs help.). They reverence and utilize spiritual prayer, and respect the underlying spiritual truth in the ceremonies of various cultures. They most often are imbued with an almost missionary zeal to make people wake up to their highest and best potential. These Star Kids also want to change the world for the better, whether by working for peace, by spreading compassion and kind deeds, by working to heal the Earth’s pollution injuries, or telling people about the larger family we have out among the stars. These are some of the ways in which a Star Kid may be recognized. As noted earlier, not every Star Kid (or Star Seed adult, for that matter) is aware that of their special starseed origin. These are the unawakened ones, the ones I call “the Latents”. They are aware that they are different from other people in a number of persistent and profound ways. But they may not understand why. Or they may have only a hazy sense of their true nature.
15



But it is necessary for these Latent ones to wake up. And now. The alarm clock is going off. We are at the 11th Hour for the Fourth World. The Transition to Fifth World is occurring between now and 2012, a mere seven years at this writing. An unaware (“Latent”) Star Kid may become an awakened Star Kid in the following ways:
- 1) first and foremost by accepting that s/he is a Star Kid, and then
- 2), by educating him/herself about what it means to be a Star Kid; and then,
- 3) by activating and practicing the gifts s/he has, and also,
- 4) then by focusing on his/her particular mission in this incarnation, and dedicating him/herself to getting going with that mission, and finally,
- 5) by identifying and then collaborating with other Star Seeds and Star Kids to build the natural network of Fifth World builders, and being an active, aware member of the Star Seed support community.
Distinguishing a Star Kid From a “Normal” Human Child
One of the things that distinguishes a Star Kid from a "normal" but bright regular human is the broad spectrum of advanced abilities that a Star Kid (or adult Star Seed, for that matter) has. There certainly are a few highly-gifted "regular" humans, say with an IQ in the 140 (genius) range, sprinkled throughout the human population. This is commendable, and represents variation in the distribution of genes for intelligence over the generations -- what scientists call "genetic drift". Genetic drift explains how a genius parent may well have an average child, and a developmentally-delayed parent may have a child of normal intelligence, or even gifted superiority. This is called "regression towards the mean", i.e., the tendency of regular human genes to tend to stay not too far from the inherent average (100 IQ) over the generations. And again, all humans are hybrids to the extent that we all are descended from forebearers who were bioengineered from primate stock. The Star Visitors did some genesplicing, splicing in genes for intelligence, dexterity, etc. But when I discuss “hybrids” hereafter, I am referring to children who are the product of the new wave of bioengineering which has increasingly been impacting the human race for the past half-century. These are the new ones. the neo-hybrids, the ones I call the Star Kids. With Star Kids, super-intelligence is genetically wired into the advanced human (neohybrid) genome. Thus, it is stable, and will not regress over the generations to the "regular" (paleohybrid) human mean average of 100, because the Star Kid genome's genes for intelligence are at a way higher number. I do not have enough data at this point to state with precision the average IQ for a Star Kid. And indeed, the current measurements used to signify intelligence are inadequate for measuring both the additional areas of intelligence which Star Kids/Seeds have, and the multi-tasking (multivariate) ways in which Star Kids/Seeds absorb and process the information in their environment. And, to be sure, the Star Kid genome is "wired" for a lot more abilities than "just" superintelligence. Things like electromagnetic-photic field sensitivity reading, as just one example. Or predicting tomorrow's events based on genius plus intuition plus "sensitivity" plus telepathic impressions received, etc.
16



All of that said, I would offer an educated guess that of the Star Kids old enough to begin to manifest their true full-strength abilities, the "average" IQ would be in the over-150 range, conservatively, and more probably in the over-180 range. And again, this is said with the proviso that the current Intelligence Quotient construct is not really adapted for Star Kid measurement.
Prevalence of Star Kids In the General Population
As to the second question, what is the prevalence of Star Kids/Seeds in the general population, or asked another way, how many Star Kids/Star Seeds are currently living? The prevalence of Star Kids/Seeds in the general population, if diagramed on a graph, would be a steeply ascending curve. In the 1940s I estimate that Star Kids Seeds were few and far between, perhaps representing one in thirty-five (a little over 2%) of the population. There appears to have been a dramatic influx of Star Kids being born, starting in the 1970s. These now-Star Seed adults are having children of their own, many of whom are secondgeneration Star Kids. In addition, the Star Visitors' past contacts with experiencers that have involved reproductive genetic engineering have resulted in an avalanche of new incoming Star Kids. So large is this wave at its current crest, that I estimate that in the population of 6-yearsolds and under, most are Star Kids. Later in this chapter, I will give you actual percentages and numbers. Can you imagine what our society will be like as these children come of age and start making their contributions? The general scientific community has not caught up with this phenomenon yet. They are still publishing charts which state that the Profoundly Gifted (those above 180 IQ) are fewer than one-in-a-million. But teachers I have talked to, particularly in the elementary grades, when asked if today's kids are like those they taught 10-15 years ago quickly say "No!" They marvel at the sharpness of mind, quick learning, and matrix-style information-assembly that so many of these new kids can do. These teachers may not be able to put their finger on why so many of these kids are more advanced, (hint: it is not due to television exposure), but the teachers recognize that there is a quantum leap in so many of the new kids' functioning. The other question has to do with U.S. or global prevalence rates of Star Kids/Star Seeds in the general population. I think it best to think globally, since the Star Kids phenomenon is not restricted to the United States. Here I would have to make a rough estimate based on limited data. The latest figures available state that the median age of a person on Earth today is 27.5 years old. A very significant number of these under-26 population are Star Kids or young-adult Star Seeds. There are much fewer numbers of middle-aged and older adults who are Star Seeds. This conclusion is based on my experience with hundreds of people who are Star Kids or Star Seeds. There is a growing wave of Star Kids among those being born. The surge of incoming Star Kids is so pronounced that among children now being born, that it constitutes a tidal wave. This conclusion was based originally on my random informal sampling on several continents, utilizing detection methods such as the size of children’s auras, the degree of precocious development and abilities in children, high intelligence, novel thinking styles, pronounced psychic abilities, and the large dimensions of their bodily energy fields, etc.
17



The teachers I talk with confirm that there is an amazing change in the kind of children coming into their classrooms these days. Let me illustrate the way this tidal wave of Star Kids slowly mounts and then crescendoes through the various age cohorts of the population. Recently I received an e-mail letter from a Star Seed young man in the United Kingdom, asking me about what percentage of the human race is of Star Seed heritage. The letter from “Sterling” asks what percent of humanity currently living do I think are Star Seeds. Children as well as adults. “Sterling’s” letter prompted me to look into the research I have been doing, to do some additional empirical surveys, and to develop some figures based on the best available information. Since this is pioneering work, there were no existing data to rely on. While I am going to present the fruits of my initial quantitative research in this fascinating area, my research continues and will be refined. This is initial and inductive research.
Recently I did several field surveys of Star Kids and Star Seed adults in the U.S. population. For a brief initial survey of potential Star Children, I took advantage of a trip to Orlando, Florida in May, 2004 to check out the children who happened to be in attendance at Disney World. In a subsequent, larger sample-size survey of both children and adults of all ages, I conducted surveys on June 14, 2004 at the main mall in Sacramento, California, and also at a Wal-Mart in a poverty area of South Sacramento, where there is a substantial mix of ethnicities. To provide some further correction against any middle-class or working-class skew in the data which would not adequately reflect the poverty class, I did a tactically-brief small-sample survey in the heart of “West Parkway”, an area of Sacramento notorious for violent crime, hard-drugs trafficking, and gang drive-by shootings. The means I used of determining who were Star Kids and Star Seed adults in the surveys was by the use of dowsing rods. These dowsing rods are used to compare the relative sizes of the bio-electromagnetic-photic fields around an individual if they are a Star Kid or Star Seed adult versus the size of their field of they are an ordinary human. As you might expect, the bioelectromagnetic-photic field, (what I also call their “energy signature”,) around a Star Kid is so considerably larger than the one around an ordinary human than there is no chance of confusing the two. (These bio-electromagnetic-photic fields are described in Chapter Two, where I also describe in more detail the use of dowsing rods to distinguish Star Kid/Star Seed fields from those which surround ordinary humans.) In the surveys I used a pair of shorter dowsing rods in an unobtrusive fashion, as people walked by my position on a bench strategically located near a principal entranceway. In the case of the West Parkway area, I subtly dowsed people as I drove slowly by. The dowsing rods technique was intermittently cross-checked with a visual survey of the person’s aura, to determine whether comparative radius of the person’s aura was consistent with comparative radius of bio-electromagnetic-photic energy around a given person.( The aura is a visually-discernible lighted area, glow, or shimmering field which extends out anywhere from 1/3 of an inch to a foot or more from the contours of a person’s body, and is particularly noticeable in the head-and-shoulders area.) In each sampled case, the proportional dimensions of the person’s aura were congruent with the proportional dimensions of their bio-electromagneticphotic field. In these surveys, people measured were place in one of six age groupings: 1) ages infant12 years old, 2) ages 13-18, 3) ages 19-29, 4) ages 30-45, 5) ages 45-60, and 6) ages 60+. Age

was determined by estimation by this researcher, a behavioral scientist with many decades of clinical and social interview experience. The survey technique was passive, measuring each person of a selected age cohort who went by, until I had over 36 subjects in each of the six age categories. The results formed a data matrix of the numbers of Star Kids/Star Seeds versus ordinary humans by age cohorts. I then analyzed the trends in these data. Two trends became apparent. The first trend evident is that the younger the age group, the higher the proportion of persons in it who are Star Kids. This trend is consistent with the many reports I have received, and have read from other researchers, from behavioral science professionals working with experiencers, from school teachers, from psychics, and from the Star Kids themselves. There is a growing wave of Star Kids coming in. I will have more to comment on that later. The second trend I found was that the proportion of Star Kids and Star Seed adults is somewhat higher in more favorable environments, and somewhat less so in the more socioeconomically-challenged environments. The percentage differences are not huge; they average 9% across the six age categories. Because of the limited survey data, I would not want to develop any further interpretation of this difference until further studies take place. After analyzing the trends in the data from these surveys, I then proceeded to apply these data and trends to the larger world population as a whole. This extrapolation was done not because there are an abundance of studies; (there are not; so far as I know; mine is the first), but because of the pressing need to begin to have some idea of the size and scope of the Star Kid and Star Seed phenomena. And because of the overarching importance of this phenomenon. Because the world is not the United States, (far from it!), I have elected to use the percentage figures from the less-advantaged survey population to make any applications globally, since these are more likely to more closely reflect the average human situation on a worldwide basis. Now, there is some margin for error in extrapolating results from one area to another, not to mention to the global population. Orlando is not Moscow. Sacramento is not Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of the Congo), not to mention is not even Pascagoula, Mississippi. So, there will be some imprecision in the numbers and percentages which follow. It will remain for future surveys by other research scientists, using similar methodologies, to confirm or refine these results. Nevertheless, the Star Kid phenomenon is global, and abundantly so. I have traveled extensively, and am in communication, especially by the Internet, with people on every continent except Antarctica. All of these contacts confirm that Star Kids and adult Star Seeds are everywhere, and in great numbers. There is nothing in the data I am about to present which is contradicted by careful observations by informed professionals specializing in this field. What I am going to present here are some exciting results in descriptive form. I will be presenting these findings using the more conservative socioeconomic percentages mentioned earlier. In my brief initial field survey done at Orlando, Florida, I did not break out the children measured into age cohorts. Of the children in the area sample, approximately 95% of the children measured had Star Kid energy signatures. These figures include children from kids in strollers to strapping teenagers.
19



When I did the more comprehensive Sacramento surveys, I did break out the data into age cohorts. The following results were obtained.
Percentages of Star Kids and Adult Star Seeds in the U.S. Population
In the group comprised of children from infants to 12 years of age, 96% tested as Star Kids! Teenagers (those in the 13-18-year-old group) are made up of 81% Star Kids. Two-thirds of young adults (those 19-29) are Star Seeds (67%). Almost half of the younger mature adults (ages 30-45) had Star Seed energy signatures (45%). One in five middle-aged (45-60) persons is a Star Seed (21%). Even among senior (60+) citizens, one in eight (12.%) has a Star Seed energy signature. Now, I have to tell you that I was positively dumbfounded by these results. I had frankly not expected the numbers to be anywhere nearly so large! After I completed these surveys, I had to take the rest of the day off. I was so flabbergasted. As I sat and reflected on the implications of these studies, a principal implication stood squarely in my face. It had became clear that very many of these Star Kids, and certainly most of the Star Seed adults, are very likely unaware of their real nature. These are what may be labeled Star Kid and Star Seed “Latents”, persons not yet awakened to their complete heritage and their full potential. More about this later!
Percentages of Star Kids and Star Seeds Globally
Next, I extrapolated these Star Kid/Star Seed percentages to Earth’s current population, which the UN estimates to total 6.3 billion humans alive now. Again, the figures are staggering. The Global Star Kid Count, (those ages infant to 19, including “Latents”), is 2.2 billion! That is not a typo, the word starts with a “b”. The Global adult Star Seed Count, (adults ages 20-100+, including “Latents”), is 1.5 billion. United Nations demographers tell us that the median age of humankind today is 27.5 years old. That means that there are as many people younger than 27.5 as there are older than 27.5 years of age.
In the younger half of the human population, (where the Star Kid Tidal Wave is embedded,) of these 3.1 billion youthful citizens, 86% (2, 740,000,000) are Star Kids and Star Seed young adults. Whereas in the older half of the human population, a lesser 31% (1,008,000,000) are Star Seeds, and most of these are the younger mature adults.
20



Numbers of Star Kids in the United States
Next, we can proceed to extrapolate these percentages to the United States. The latest available demographics peg the current U.S. population at over 281 million people. The pre-high school U.S population, (ages 0-14), is made up of approximately 60 million children. Of these, 85% are American Star Kids (51, 450,732). In the high school to early adult sector, (ages 15-24), there are approximately 39 million young people. Of these, 73% are American Star Kids or Star Seed young adults (28,707,504). These include young adults coming of age and starting to build their careers and families, as well as those soon to enter these ranks. This is where the Star Kid Tidal Wave is starting to penetrate the current society in ways it can already sense, but has not yet really fathomed. As the many Latent Star Kids and Star Seeds awaken to their true nature and abilities, society will not be able to miss their impact. One more statistic and then I promise I will stop. (At least for a while.) Looking over the age cohorts, and linking ages to year of birth, it is possible to approximate the year in which there started to be more Star Kids born on Earth than ordinary humans, In other words, the year the human race “crossed the fifty-yard line” towards Fifth World society. My best approximation is that that year was 1970. What was going on in 1970? Richard Nixon was U.S. President. The United States was embroiled it what seemed an interminable Vietnam War. Protest racked the nation as young people marched in opposition. Four student protestors at Kent State University, Ohio were shot dead by National Guardsmen called in to quell student war protest, as the nation recoiled in horror. The United States Senate repealed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which had been used previously to legitimate the U.S. military incursion into Vietnam. The golden glow of the Sixties was wearing thin. The Beatles were breaking up. Rock icons Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin both died of alleged drug-related deaths at age 27. The American nation was searching for a new direction. It clearly was an opportune time for Star Seed-enhanced human children, and Star Visitors-incarnating-as-Star Kid humans, to start coming in in large enough numbers to make a difference. In 1970 perhaps one out of two babies being born was a Star Kid. By 2004, (when this book is being written,) nineteen out of twenty babies being born are Star Kids! This is an incoming Tidal Wave! And as we experience a crescendoing wave like this, there is no indication that the growth curve is finished. In fact, it appears that we are looking rather soon at the time when virtually every child being born will be a Star Kid. And given gene-mixing factors such as intermarriage, tissue/organ transplantations, etc., it is easy to see on the near horizon the completion of the rapid hybridization of the entire human race into a race of Star Seeds. So, it is safe to say that when you look into the eyes of a Star Child today, you are looking at the future
21



face of the human race! Homo alterios spatialis, (Cosmic Humankind), as Professor George Robinson, former Counsel at the Smithsonian Institution, termed the new human race that is emerging, when he addressed the international conference, When Cosmic Cultures Meet, in Washington, D.C. in 1995 (Human Potential Foundation, 1996). Even before such a day dawns, the statistics above show that among all humans alive today, the proportion of Homo Alterios Spatialis (the neohybrid Star Kids and Star Seed adults) to Homo Sapiens Sapiens (ordinary humans) is 59%. Put another way, about three out of every five persons walking by is a Star Seed, or more likely, a Star Kid, since the majority of these are in the under-27 half of the human race.)
The Star Kid Latents: Star Kids Not Yet Awakened To Their Status
And yet, of these Star Kids (and adult Star Seeds) walking by, there are so many, the majority in fact, who have not yet recognized who they are at this time. It is a major issue that not all these Star Kids and Star Seeds are "awakened". That is to say, many of these Kids are aware of some differences, or that they don't fit the pattern of so-called normal society portrayed in the media, yet they have yet to fully understand why they are different. Nor do many understand their star origin. They may just feel "different” than the other kids their age they see portrayed in television and the movies as what is normal. Once they get an explanation for why they are different, these Star Kids light up like a light bulb. And they bubble over for joy that finally their situation makes sense! When these children come to one of our Star Kid Workshops, it is a joy to see them blossom with the information and confirmation they receive. It is like a desert plant after a long drought finally getting a rain shower. It straightens up, gets more color, and blooms. The task a number of us are called to now is to awaken these dormant Star Kids. That is why there are light workers everywhere trying to awaken these Star Kids and Star Seeds. And this is why the Star Kids Project, Ltd. was formed! More about that later! So, I say, look out, uninspired overlords of status-quo society! The current order will be swept away, as these star folk increasingly take their place, and proceed with fashioning the new, cosmic “Fifth World” society, long foretold in the oral traditions and prophecies of Native American and other aboriginal societies around the world.
Very Successful Star Kids
Are Star Kids just so exotic that you have to feel sorry for them? Well, no. Just consider the successful Star Seed adults who have grown up and made their way in the adult business world with renown. To pick a category that people around the world would be familiar with, let’s take Movie Stars, Media (Radio/Television) Stars, and world-famous personalities..
22



Among the many movie and media stars are some experiencers, as well as some Star Seeds. Years ago Shirley MacLaine outted herself as accepting the reality of UFO encounters, and today maintains a website where she encourages people to share their Star Visitor-encounter experiences: http://shirleymaclaine.com/mysteries/ufoarticles.html And comedienne television and radio personality Roseanne Barr, on her recent radio show program, did a feature on persons who had had encounters with the Star Visitors. I was a featured expert on this segment. During the program, in response to a question from the audience, Roseanne acknowledged that she, too, had had such an encounter. Apparently the Star Visitors are broad-minded enough to extend their contacts to rock musicians. Sammy Hagar of the rock band Van Halen has said that he has had close encounters with apparent “aliens”. There are a number of movie stars, celebrities and notables who have the energy signature of Star Kids. But let me be clear: not every celebrity who is a Star Kid or adult Star Seed is actually aware of being a Star Kid (or Star Seed). Some of them just know that there has always been something about them that is a bit different. And let’s also be clear: most Star Kids are not famous. But that is just as well. Star Kids are here principally to make a difference for the planet, for society, and in the individual lives of persons around them. Few will ever get famous. But every one of them is here now for an important reason. The sum of all the Star Kids (and Star Seed adults) operating in full awareness will truly transform society and this Earth.

Chapter 2
Physical Attributes of the Star Kids
Every Star Kid can tell you something physical about herself or himself which other people sometimes comment on, or which the Star Kid personally notices is different. Now, there is no standard set of physical characteristics that each and every Star Kid has. There is great variation, in fact. Some Star Kids seem to have only one or two or three distinctive physical characteristics. Others have quite a number of them. Why is there such variation in the number and kind of Star Kid physical qualities? I do not have a complete answer to that question. Because some Star Kids are aware of partial heritage from one of the races of the Pleiades system, or the Zeta Reticuli system, while others have heritage from other races, such as the “Praying Mantis”, Reptoid, or light beings groups, etc., it is tempting to ascribe some physical differences to the extraterrestrial portion of those Star Kids’ genes. But until more information is available, suffice to say that there are differences. Allow me to inject here a personal anecdote along these lines. I can tell you the first time I noticed that there was something different about myself. This was at age 14 when I went to buy my first hat. (Note: I was a Southern California boy who had grown up in a climate of sunshine almost 365 days a year. In those days (the 1950s) nobody worried about solar damage to the eyes or skin. So, I had no need for a hat as a child, and only bought one to be cool as a teenager.) I looked and looked in store after store and could not find one in my head size. Finally, I asked the manager of one store why they didn’t stock hats in size 7-3/4. The manager replied, “They don’t make them that big. Sorry.” This was 1953. Even today this is not a common hat size, but manufacturers have taken to making caps with an adjustable strap in the back which can be expanded to fit the larger head sizes that many Star Kids and adult Star Seeds come in these days. Not that the manufacturer is aware about Star Kids; just that “kids are getting bigger.” If you’ll permit yet another anecdote: when I was born, my mother complained that I “almost killed her.” What she was somewhat over-dramatically referring to was my very large head size and overall size (9 lbs, 1-1/2 oz. at birth). In those days I was considered a very large baby. Over the ensuing six decades, as more Star Kids have come in, the many larger Star Kids have driven up the overall averages for infant body dimensions. Scientists have tried to explain these dimensional gains as due to “the better nutrition in the modern American diet.” They do not take note that the modern child’s food intake in this era of fast food restaurants and junk food snacks is nutritionally worse than the more wholesome and less-refined diet of several decades earlier. These scientists are grasping at straws, because the scientific doctrine of evolution does not allow for such striking changes in the average overall makeup of an organism (in this case, human children) in such a short period of time. But there are more striking things about many Star Kids than size at birth. Indeed, others and I have noted in certain Star Kids the kind of exaggeratedly-large (to us) eyes/eye sockets that incline one to the view that such Star Kids may be exhibiting some signs of partial genetic
24



linkage to the Zeta Reticuli Visitors, who certainly do have rather very large eyes. Or certain Star Kids seem to have the wispy and light-colored hair and disproportionately-large craniums that some experiencers have seen aboard star ships in those Zeta-hybrid children who grow up aboard ship, and who are the product of gene-splicing incorporating a minority of partial selected human genes, followed by in-vitro fertilization. And other Star Kids have a kind of Scandinavian-like, striking, ethereal great beauty or handsomeness which brings to mind the thought that they may be reflecting partial lineage with those “Nordic” Star Visitors from the Pleiades or Altair star systems. In other cases some of the variability seems to be due to the different kinds of Star Visitor consciousnesses/persons who have chosen to incarnate in human bodies for this lifetime. More than a few Star Kids (and adult Star Seeds) have described the difficulty of trying to express their fine-tuned, exquisite, star-born consciousness and nervous system in the comparatively-dense physical human body they find themselves in. Some of us behavioral scientists and therapists working with experiencers and Star Kids have reached the tentative conclusion that the reason why a number of Star Kids get mis-diagnosed in school with “Attention-Deficit Disorder” (ADD) or “Hyperactivity Disorder” (HD) labels is precisely because these Star Kids’ very fine-tuned consciousnesses and energy fields are processing at “too high” a rate to be considered normal (among ordinary humans), who often tend to perceive these kids as “flitting from one thing to another” or as being “in constant motion”. Let us in all fairness try to see this problem from a Star Visitor perspective. If these Star Kids were to slow down to what is considered “normal” among ordinary humans, they would have to pretend to be taking a long time to comprehend what the other children in class are struggling with, (which means that they would be operating in a manner which would be considered developmentally-disabled in a star culture. And, with all the energy pouring through his or her system, if the Star Kid tried to slow down motorically to meet the behavioral pace expectations of his/her regular-human teacher or parent, it would be fake, and it would seem like pretending to walk underwater. Besides, the pent-up, unexpressed energy would back up inside the Star Kid and drive him frantic. As more and more Star Kids come in, society seems to be taking one of two reactions. The Progressives are deciding that the norms of what is considered “normal” and “average” need to be changed to better fit today’s children. The Stand-Patters bemoan how there is an “epidemic” of ADD and HD children these days. The Stand-Patters practically want to place Ritalin vending machines in the halls of every elementary and junior high school. Oy, veh! As the Southern prison warden in the classic movie, Cool Hand Luke drawled, “What we have here is a failure to communicate!” It is my hope that this book will be a contribution towards increased understanding of Star Kids, which will lead to better communication: between parents and Star Kids, between teachers and parents of Star Kids, and between pediatricians and child psychologists and the Star Kids and their families. Before we leave the topic of neurological differences between Star Kids and ordinary humans, allow me to tell one more personal anecdote. Over the past decade I have noticed in my body increasing amounts of “surplus” biological energy. This energy particularly has seemed noticeable in the large muscles, especially the legs. This has been most noticeable in the evenings, when I find myself unready to go to bed at what “normal” people consider bedtime. The later in the day it goes, the more the “surplus” energy builds up, manifesting in body
25



restlessness, particularly in the legs. This restlessness is only partially alleviated by pacing or moving about. This phenomenon is not mine alone, of course. It has come to the attention of the medical industry, which has recently taken note of this strange new “malady” and assigned it the label of “Restless Legs Syndrome”, (RLS), or its variant, “Periodic Limb Movements in Sleep”, (PLMS). Needless to say, the doctors found a pill for it, in fact several pills, to treat this strange malady which seems to be becoming more common in the adult population. (Just as Hyperactivity Disorder” seems to be becoming more prevalent in the juvenile population.) The doctors have appropriated drugs which were designed to treat epilepsy, and prescribe them for their patients with this problem of too much energy. What these medications do is interfere with nerve cell function, so that the patient does not feel restless. Another class of medications the doctors alternatively utilize are narcotics, to “snow” the patient into a chemical calm. While these pills may temporarily quench the sensation of excessive bodily energy, they do not address the issue of where this overabundance of somatic energy comes from; and, needless to say, these pills do not cure, only subdue Restless Legs Syndrome, which is a non-illness as far as Star Kids are concerned. I was challenged with this excessive energy problem for a number of years, until I had the good fortune to have a Star Seed woman sent to me by her Star Visitor guides to provide me with a consultation to address this problem. The woman turned out to be a person who had lived in the Pleiades in a previous incarnation. This Star Seed woman helped me to understand that as I was continuing to open up to my Star Seed heritage, more and more energy was flowing through me. In order to make this high abundance of energy more manageable, she suggested that I “ground” the excessive energy until such time as my life circumstances arrived at a point where I would be putting all that energy to productive full use. Her suggestion prompted me to recall a grounding technique which my friend, Dakota (Sioux) spiritual elder Golden Eagle [Standing Elk] had demonstrated several years ago, during a Calling-In of The Star Elders ceremony. One of the participants did not follow directions about not sitting in the North Door, and positioned himself in the North Door (pathway) of the Medicine Wheel circle we all sat in. The North Door is where the Star Beings come into the circle. I saw one of the Star Beings, manifested as a large spark of bluish-white light, float into the circle through the North Door during the ceremony. The foolish young man adjusted his position and sat right in the middle of the North Door entranceway. When time came for the Star Being to exit our circle, he floated right out the North Door and right through the foolish young man. This fellow rapidly began shaking and thrashing around, with the most severe case of excessive bodily energy I have seen. In fact it looked like a full-blown Petit Mal seizure. The Elders who had directed the ceremony noticed this foolish man’s distress and directed several of us to escort him out into the front yard. There stood a large and very solid mature tree. Golden Eagle told the young man to stand against the tree and put his arms around it and send all his excess energy into the tree and down into Mother Earth, where it would be harmlessly recycled. He did so, and after a couple of shaky minutes visibly calmed down and stopped shaking. Another minute of this and this sober, calm man was back to normal, wiser and less foolhardy than before his uncalled-for stunt. So, I, too, tried out this grounding technique the next night after my consultation, as a particularly strong wave of overabundant energy accumulated in me. I walked out into the nighttime dark an up to a large, old tree in my front yard, hugged it while standing with the bare
26



soles of my feet against Mother Earth. I focused and sent all the excess energy into the tree and directed it downward through the trunk and roots and into the earth. The results were amazing. Almost at once, and certainly in less than a minute, I could feel the excess energy draining away from my body and into the tree. I determined that I needed to turn off the draining process at a certain point, so as to leave enough bodily energy to allow me to operate at a robust normal level. The next night I noticed there was much less accumulation of excessive bodily energy. What excess there was I dealt with again by going out front and grounding it into the tree. My “Restless Legs Syndrome” was cured. I no longer needed powerful neurological medication. I had a natural and respectful way to manage energy accumulation, while awaiting the time when I would need to harness it all for special projects up ahead. Meanwhile, I found that I could adjust the energy drain to a level that assured I had plenty of abundant energy for my daily tasks, (which include writing many chapters of this book after “normal” people are in bed. The abundant energy which I and other Star Kids and adult Star Seeds experience is not really excessive or pathological. This abundant energy is intended for Star Kids/Seeds to have available to us when we need to do something special or important that requires above-normal energy output. As we get into Fifth World society, this energy will not seem surplus. The challenge at the present is to learn to manage this seemingly-surplus energy. And there are natural ways, respectful ways to do so, an example of which was outlined above. Now, let’s look at some other physical qualities of some Star Kids. Many, if not most, have greater physical development in the frontal and parietal (cranium roof) areas of the skull, (the area from above the eyes up and over the top of the head to the back.) Presumably this makes room for proportionately larger development of the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain. These are areas of the brain which support intelligence, higher consciousness and psychic abilities. Many Star Kids are as “hyper”-developed in this area of their brain case as some prehistoric proto-hominids were deficient in this area. Those protohominids actually a recessed (concave) area in their frontal skull area in contrast to the flat or outward-curved (convex) skull shape of modern humans. And many experiencers have noted that so many of the star races have proportionately larger heads in relation to their body than do humans. It seems to be a truism of cosmic physiology that it takes a somewhat larger cranium size to support the increased brain size and greater intricate brain structure which are the physical support for greater intelligence. It therefore should come as no surprise that many of the Star Kids, who share extraterrestrial genes along with their human ones, should have somewhat larger heads in general. “The eyes are the windows of the soul,” the old saying goes. What then are we to expect of Star Kids’ eyes? Many people I have talked to have commented on Star Kids’s eyes. “When he looks at you, it’s like he’s reading you inside.” “Her eyes are so gentle, like an angel’s.” “His gaze seems so grown-up for his age.” More than a few people have commented on how these children look at you with an adult-like knowing stare. This can be so disconcerting to some people, who wonder how to treat such a kid: as an adult? As a child? Or what? The answer is that Star Kids are children, just wise beyond their years. Another characteristic which is pretty commonly shared among Star Kids is a lower-thanaverage body temperature. While the standard household oral thermometer has a “normal”mark on its scale at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), the temperatures of very many Star Kids can read lower by one, two, or more degrees Fahrenheit. . Thus, it is important for a parent to take their Star Kid’s temperature several times over several weeks to find out what their particular child’s actual normal temperature is. It is not uncommon for a Star Kid to have a
27



normal temperature that is a degree or two below the old household standard of 98.6 F. If, for example, a Star Kid has a normal temperature of 96.8, and their reading on the fever thermometer is 98.6 F, the child may actually be running a slight fever even though the household thermometer says that their temperature is “normal”. Also, it is useful to be aware that some Star Kids (and adult Star Seeds) might start out life with a standard body temperature, and then their body temperature drops later as their Star Seed development takes hold over time. A personal anecdote here is timely. As a child I registered 98.6 F on the household thermometer like the good Boy Scout I was. But in more recent years, my standard body temperature is more like 96.8 F. I have been told by a physiologist that a somewhat lower body temperature is a good thing: it suggests a lower basal metabolic rate – meaning your body is not burning up as fast. And this means that you will last longer. Which may lead to another difference that is noted in many Star kids as they grow into older Star Seed adults – they age more slowly. Many Star Seeds in their late middle-age and senior years look younger than many of their age peers. And, besides a less aged appearance, many of these grown-up Star kids exhibit more stamina, more endurance, and more vitality in their senior years. They have a body energy level which, even when they are not in motion, people expect to find in someone much younger than the Star Seed senior. Which may help explain why many Star Seeds are guessed to be considerably younger than their chronological age, sometimes by 20 or more years! This gentle aging is the paradoxical flip-side of what happens when the Star Kid is young. Young Star Kids typically develop much faster than what has been considered standard childhood norms. In fact, the old norms are having to be thrown out. I am friendly with Dr. Roger Leir, DPM, a Southern California podiatrist who has made a study of developmental differences in children over the past half-century. I will not go into detail about Dr. Leir’s findings, because he regularly makes public presentations on his findings, and they are his to share. But suffice to say that most of the standard developmental milestones which are used by pediatricians to determine whether a baby is developing normally have changed dramatically over the past half-century. The age by which a child first holds up his head, first sits up unaided, takes her first step, says his first word, talks in whole sentences – these and many other developmental milestones have advanced substantially over the past 50 years, sometimes by a half-year earlier, or an entire year earlier, or more! Dr. Leir used as his comparison developmental norms published in standard medical reference books 50 years ago, and then compared milestones to those found in modern medical texts. The dramatic differences, Dr. Leir sagely notes, cannot be ascribed to evolutionary gains. Standard evolutionary theory posits that major changes in an organism take millennia to evolve and then stabilize as the new norm through natural selection. That such major human child developmental milestones should shift dramatically in the human race in the brief span of 50 years, an eye-blink in the evolutionary time cycle, cannot be accounted for by evolution. So, what, then, has caused this dramatic shift? Good question, Dr. Leir. It should provide some amusing moments to hear conventional scientists try to account for this lightning-fast shift, evolutionarily speaking. The changes that the onset of the Star Kids have occasioned are not limited to the hat manufacturing industry having to come to terms with kids who wear size 7-3/4 or larger. There is also the shoe industry. According to the American Footwear Retailers Association, in the last five years the Americans' average shoe size has grown from 9-1/2 to 10-1/2 for men, and from 8
28



to 9 for women. "The increase has been steady in the last 50 years," said the Association's spokesperson Millie Zapata, "but in the last five years it has been nothing short of meteoric” (Polovetsky, T., 2004). When I was a young teen, fifty years ago, my size 10 shoe was considered a large size. Now, it’s nothing for young men to wear size 11, 12, 14, or larger! Then there is the matter of physical height. Nowadays it is not uncommon to see high school and college students who are 6'6" or 7 feet or taller. These are not the rare genetic abnormality of yore, which tended to predestine the young person to a career as a basketball player. These tall youngsters are pointing towards a new standard of what is normal height. In a story datelined Kansas City, Missouri, Knight-Ridder News Service quoted some teachers’ observations. “We’ve talked about it," said Bette Johnson, principal of Hillcrest Elementary School in Belton, Mo. "It seems each generation is a bit bigger than the last." At Lone Jack Elementary, there's a sixth-grade boy who is 5-foot-9. At Line Creek Elementary in Kansas City North, Mo., there are fifth-graders approaching 6 feet. Line Creek gym teacher Donna Curran, 49, said that when she was 14, she was 6 feet tall and the biggest girl in her basketball conference. Today, she said, "it's nothing" to have 6-foot freshman girls.” [“Sizing Up Kids Nothing More Than Tall Tale”, Adler, 2001). I can relate to Ms. Curran. I was 6'2" in seventh grade, easily towering over every other kid in my class (in 1951). Adult strangers in the store addressed me as “Sir”, assuming I must be an adult if I’m that tall. “Size matters,” they say. Perhaps so, but what’s inside is also very important. Other very common characteristics of Star Kids are a more robust immune system and general good body self-repair capability. After necessary exposure to the usual childhood illnesses, in order for the body to build immunity to them, many Star Kids go on to be much healthier than regulart human children, not getting colds and flus as often as other children do. These Star Kids seem to avoid coming down with the viruses that are going around the school in middle grades and junior high. Or if they do catch something, they have a mild case, or shake off the virus very rapidly. And when these kids get scrapes and cuts, these heal much faster than “normal”, and very often do not leave scars. Today’s young children, the majority of whom are of Star Kid stock, also mature sexually more than their forebearers. In the United States, the average for the onset of menstruation is 12 13 years (12.1 for blacks; 12.8 for whites) as opposed to an average age of 14 years back in 1900. American girls reach puberty earlier than commonly believed, with nearly half of AfroAmerican girls and 15% of white ones beginning to develop sexually by age 8, a study at UNC Chapel Hill indicates. “The study, reported in the journal Pediatrics, involved 17,000 girls age 3 through 12. By age 8, 48.3% of the Afro-American girls and 14.7% of the white girls had begun developing breasts, pubic hair or both, while menstruation occurred at 12.16 years and 12.88 years, respectively” (Coleman, B.C., 1997). And then there is a subset of Star Kids whose stories run a different course. There are Star Kids whose hair is slow to grow. They may be bald after birth, or have thin, wispy hair, which remains that way through much of childhood. These children often have a thin-framed angular look which to the trained eye suggests their unconventional heritage. These children remind me of accounts I have heard from experiencers about hybrid children they saw aboard space ships. These hybrid children are mostly Star Visitor genetically, but also have some human genes. These hybrids often have large heads and very large eyes, with thin, wispy, sometimes patchy platinum-colored hair, very thin builds and thin extremities. These are the offpring of the Zeta Reticulans, and have been genetically engineered to include a
29



few human genes deemed desirable to graft in. The Zetas have indicated to some experiencers that they are trying to re-engineer back into their genome the physical reproductive fertility, and a limited amount of the emotional range, which are abundantly present in the human race. This genetic upgrading is one of the reasons the Zeta Reticulans have been among the more frequent visitors to Earth. And so, in a kind of quid pro quo, the Zetas have also engaged in genetic upgrading of the reproductive material of many of the millions of humans they have visited and briefly taken aboard their craft. The result of this Zeta gene-splicing has been that the experiencers of these contacts have gone on to become parents of Star Kids. A wonderful exchange for a surplus ovum or sperm which the parent would never miss anyway among so many. The Zetas, like other Star Visitors, are also here of course primarily to warn humankind about the dangerous historical crossroads humans are at at this particular time, and the critical decisions we must make, and rapidly, about reversing environmental degradation, ceasing wars, treating each other as family, sharing resources equitably, and ending the rule of greed and overreaching power in human political affairs. The various Visitor races both admonish and encourage us to make the right choices to advance our human race towards readiness to be fit stewards of Earth, and then to assume our new role as active participatory cosmic citizens. An important part of the Star Kid’s body, and everyone’s body, is their electromagnetic field. The body has been compared to a wet battery, and certainly does generate electricity, although in small microvoltages typically. Further, it transmits electricity within a cell and from cell to cell. The nerve pulses which our body uses to think, move, and maintain heartbeat, breathing and other functions are transmitted by a combination of electrical signals and chemical messengers. Additionally, recent research has revealed that individual cells use minute bits of light to communicate within the cell (Richardson, 2003). So pervasive is the role of the electromagnetic field in the body that one medical researcher, Robert O. Becker, MD was prompted to write the medical classic, The Body Electric (1985). It is timely here to discuss the body’s electromagnetic-photic field and differences in that field between Star Kids and ordinary humans.
Bio-electromagnetic-photic Fields, Dowsing, and Regular Humans Versus Star Kids and Star Seeds
As a person who likes to discover things, I'd like to share my latest discoveries with you. I have been using dowsing rods as a simple mechanism to detect and measure the "Bioelectromagnetic-photic" field around people. "Bio" because the field is generated by a living organism, in this case, humans. “Electric" because humans utilize electicity (among other processes) to operate their bodies and brains, and because electromagnetic (EM) fields on Earth always have electricity and magnetism associated with each other. "Magnetic" because of the EM association just mentioned, and because the field seems to generate a counter-magnetic force, pushing the rods at right angles to their previous position. "Photic" because the field seems to have some properties of light, e.g., the field "bounces" off mirrors, and also some people can see this field as visible. When two dowsing rods are aimed toward the human under study, and held horizontal and parallel to each other, about 2-3 inches apart, as they encounter the outer edge of a person's
30



bio-electromagnetic-photic field, they splay outward to perpendicular in opposing directions (usually), forming a line perpendicular to the line between the dowser and the person being dowsed. This line appears effectively to measure the boundary of a person's bio-electromagneticphotic field. In my experience, average "normal" humans have a bio-electromagnetic-photic field out to about 12-18 inches out from their body in all directions. But, Star Kids and Star Seeds have much wider fields, anywhere from 3 feet to the current record in my book (a woman in Arizona) of almost 40 feet! But wait, it gets more interesting. I have also experimentally determined that a photograph of a person also has a bioelectromagnetic-photic field, smaller than, but proportional to, their field if they were standing there in person. I determined this by dowsing photos of people I knew were Star Seeds and people I knew were not, and noting the proportionate relationships in the fields their photographic images emitted. This part is not exactly news. Shamans and psychic practitioners know that photographs carry something of the essence/presence of the person represented. Understanding this helps one appreciate why Native Americans use to resent being photographed by the European settlers, because the Native Americans felt that the white men were trying to bottle up their soul in the camera/photograph, (for who knows what purpose.) I made a further discovery. When I dowsed photographs of a couple of individuals I suspect are deeply involved in the UFO Cover-Up Cabal, including a “retired” Colonel "formerly" of the Army Intelligence and Security Command's psychic weapons studies unit, with a doctorate in Death Science, and his friend, a fellow Army Intelligence Lt. Colonel who has been arrested and charged as a serial child pedophile ringleader, and Head of the Satanic Temple of Set, I noted that the dowsing rods crossed over on top of one another in a "cross-eyed" fashion, when confronting the Colonels' energy fields, i.e., went the other direction than they do for normal humans and Star folk,. This I took to mean that those operating on the dark side cast a diametrically opposite kind of energy than those trying to operate in the light. Further, I dowsed a photograph of a famous UFO information advocate, whose name would be instantly recognizable to any ufologist, and the rods went cross-eyed in his field as well. I am not going to identify him here, but it raised further questions about who we have on "our" side in this struggle with the forces behind the UFO Cover-Up. Back to the light side. I find this dowsing tool to be good "trainer wheels" in developing psychic sensitivity. Of course, persons who practice and develop their psychic sensing/empathy/intuition are able to discern who is who without the use of dowsing rods. I like to say that Star Kids and Star Seeds can sense a fellow Star person across a crowded room. And I encourage all to develop their inner sensitivities, and feel free to dispense with tools as they gain confidence in their native abilities. . As one practices, then the need for dowsing rods is no more. But as a handy way to tell who you are dealing with, or if you're feeling psychically lazy, or have a headache and aren't able to concentrate inwardly, then the dowsing rods are a quick way to tell a bit about a person. In my understanding, all knowledge and events are present (contained) in the higher consciousness field, which some might label the "mind of God", or the Akashic Record, or what Swiss psychologist Carl Jung called the "collective unconscious". We, as sparks of that consciousness, have access to that higher consciousness field, which both permeates the entire cosmos and our mental fields as well. Some are gifted with ready direct contact with that consciousness field. Others find the use of mediating tools to be helpful in
31



accessing the higher consciousness field. Some such tools are dowsing rods, and the use of the pendulum, among other ways. Yet the person using the dowsing rods or the pendulum is him/herself a conscious being, and has to be a wise steward in utilizing these tools in a way that is conducive to a correct "reading" of the information available in the higher consciousness field. The person exercises responsibility: 1) in choosing to use the tool, 2) in setting an intention to acquire information, 3) in setting an intention about how to use the information, 4) in creating his/her interpretation of what the information acquired means, 5) in operating in an ethical way with the informationgathering, and 6) in responsibleness about using the information that has been acquired. Accessing the higher consciousness field is also, in my understanding, how remote viewing works. And what does all of this have to do with UFOs, Star Kids, close-encounter experiencers, and the societal changes resulting from close encounters? The Star Visitors, in their contacts with humans, often utilize information gathered from the higher consciousness field to do such things as show an experiencer their personal future, or a scene from society's near future. And in encounters, the Star Visitors frequently effect upgrades in the experiencer's consciousness, so that following a contact, the experiencer finds him/herself with psychic, or more intensified psychic, abilities. And the Visitors frequently thereafter choose to visit the experiencer on the “astral plane”, that is to say, via an out-of-body travel experience, (one of the psychic abilities often enhanced as a result of contact.)
By their example the Star Visitors encourage us to reach to our own highest and best unfolding as sentient conscious cosmic beings, what the Chief Counsel for the Smithsonian Institute called Homo Alterios Spatialis (Robinson, 1996). And as we practice integrating access to higher consciousness information into our regular daily lives, we progress in development towards our highest and best potential.
And, I should also mention that each person I have studied so far has a vortex at the center of their bio-electromagnetic-photic field. The vortex is at the center of the person, i.e., along a vertical line defined roughly by their spinal column and the vertical line-up of the seven chakras. To access this vortex and demonstrate its presence, all one has to do is take just one dowsing rod and hold it above the portion of one's head directly above the spinal column. The dowsing rod will rotate by itself, due to the swirl of energies at the vortex. In some people the rod (vortex) will rotate clockwise. In other people the rod (vortex) rotates counter-clockwise. The difference appears to be due to gender of the subject, although further studies are needed to confirm this provisional generalization.
So, while some people dash off to Sedona, Arizona to access the mysterious powers at one or other of the vortexes there, we would do well to contemplate that each one of us carries our own personal portable vortex. :-) I offer these above explorations for your consideration and discernment.
A Postscript Since dowsing is not familiar to all, let me suggest how to make yourself an inexpensive
32



pair of dowsing rods. You will need one wire coat hanger, a pair of pliers and a plastic drinking straw. First, use the pliers or your hands to untwist the coat hanger ends from around the neck of the hanger. Once the hanger is apart, use the pliers to cut the coat hanger in half, or bend the hanger back and forth rapidly at midpoint until metal fatigue (molecular friction heating) causes the hanger to part into two pieces. Grasp one piece and use the long straight portion as your pointer. Use the pliers to bend the shorter part into a right angle. This will be your handle. Straighten out the bends in that portion of the hanger until it is straight, (You may want to cut/twist off the neck part.) Do the same procure to the other hanger half you broke away earlier. Cut the drinking straw in half, and insert each half up the hanger handle as a swiveling sleeve. These are your free-pivoting handles, which will allow the rods to turn quite freely. Hold the rods by the plastic-straw handles, so that the long pointer arms are horizontal and parallel about one-to-two inches from each other, and pointed at the target. On people, I suggest that the target zone be the person’s sternum or solar plexus. You are now ready to do some dowsing. And Star Kids, don’t forget to have some fun!
Summary: Some Physical Attributes of Star Kids:
- larger head, especially in the area between the eyes and the posterior top of the head (the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain), resulting in greater physical structures (prefrontal cortex volume) to support greater intelligence, higher consciousness, ESP, special awareness and more integrated personality. - eyes (have a special intensity) - lower metabolic rate, as indicated by lower basal temperature; e.g., instead of a temperature of 98.6 degrees Farenheit, a Star Kid may have a temperature of 96.8. - generates a much bigger bio-electromagnetic-photic field; - body’s ambient energy tends to put out street lights (especially, the amber sodum-vapor plasma kind). - more robust immune system - body self-repair: more rapid healing system, generation of fewer or no scars; - child early development in rapid gain of physical, cognitive and emotional competencies: (Roger Leir’s 50-year comparison of child development “milestone” norms. - earlier pubescence/sexual maturation. - adult-like functioning in childhood - earlier onset of silver/gray hair, balding - less harsh stigmata upon onset of senior years - more endurance, stamina, vitality in senior years - foot size increment - hat size increment

Chapter 3
What It’s Like Mentally and Emotionally To Be a Star Kid
It’s not just physical differences that Star Kids notice about themselves. It’s the different way their minds work. And they intensely feel the emotional challenges that these differences create. Consider the following letter from a Star Seed who remembers her childhood as a Star Kid, and who has now three Star Kids of her own.
“Dear Dr. Boylan,
“I am now 62 years old, and all my life have felt that I didn’t belong in this body. It feels so awful feeling I don’t know who I am, and worse, don’t know how the hell to explain it to anyone. “I always felt different, always the square peg in a round hole. Always questioned the things other people accepted. Have an insatiable curiosity, and can spend hours on the ‘net going from one thing to another. I have been very lonely all my life because I never fitted in. If I was/am one of the vanguard – and that’s how I have felt the past few years, it would make it easier to accept all the discord I’ve had in my life. All this made me different and I never knew why. I just wanted to be accepted. I was never accepted, and even now don’t have many friends. I confront people and challenge them with radical ideas. It makes them feel uncomfortable, but this has happened all my life, and I feel that this is what I’m meant to do. Why the hell else would I keep banging my head against a brick wall!? “I don’t remember my childhood; it feels like I’ve really blocked it out, but I don’t think it was so bad that I had to do this. I don’t understand why it’s inaccessible and would really love to have it back. “Apparently, you could have a conversation with me on any subject at age 2, had a very large vocabulary and knew what the words meant. “I attended the church school, and remember distinctly when I was around 9 years old that it didn’t make any sense the stuff I heard in church. Have never been a believer in traditional religions. More drawn to the philosophy of Buddhism. “If other adults come to you with similar questions, I would love to know there is a reason for all this! “Also, I have three sons, my youngest being a lot like me when he was younger. Had a very high IQ and a misfit, always questioned things! Now he’s 26 and trying very hard to be conventional. Not doing all the crazy things he did when he was young. He was extremely difficult to rear. Always going against the convention. Had an incredible imagination, invented things in his mind all the time. Always looking for ways to do things differently. Was very sensitive, hated school, always wanted to escape to find other things to do, very bored at school,
34



very inventive. Wonderful with horses, extremely talented rider, can fix anything but was never taught. Was labeled very hyperactive as it was called when he was a two-year-old. I don’t know if this means anything, but he was a Caesarian birth. His speech was very advanced early with a large vocabulary. “My middle son has a problem with drugs. I think it’s his way of coping. He’s now 31. Ultra-sensitive, gentle and caring. “My eldest son is Mr. Square, but had his own language until he was 3, when he started talking English! Had difficulty in school, was bored in the extreme. “Does this run in families? “If you can supply any answers, that I’m not weird, that there are others out there like me, I would be so grateful!” - B.
The letter from “B” is a very common listing of the different mental characteristics of Star Kids, and how these differences affect them individually and socially. Let’s look at these one by one. First, there is the matter of “feeling I don’t know who I am,” “always feel[ing] different,” “always the square peg in the round hole,”and “always question[ing] the things other people accepted.” So many Star Kids young and older grapple with being aware that they are different. They think differently than many of the other children do. Their way of seeing things, of analyzing things, of sizing things up is different. When other, “normal” children in class are listening to what the teacher says and passively reading the textbooks, the Star Kid is noticing the contradictions and inconsistencies in what is being presented, and raising her hand, and asking the teacher to explain the contradictions. Needless to say, this behavior does not make the Star Kid the most popular child with many teachers, who just want to get through with the material and move on. Particularly if the Star Kid exposes a glaring illogicality that the teacher is not prepared to address. Nor does such independent thinking make the Star Kid popular with many of the other children. Perhaps the least unpleasant outcome would be that such a child gets labeled “The Brain”. But some children resent the kid who doesn’t go along smoothly with the class lesson. They begin to view him as a “troublemaker”, a “show-off”, a “nerd”. Coupled with the high intelligence and focused studiousness of many Star Kids and their voracious consumption of books and other information, their tendency to arrive at independent conclusions, to tear apart conventional thinking, to use different ways to problem-solve than the one shown in class, and to “matrix” answers by bringing in convergent information from several different subject areas, reveals that the Star Kids are different. “B” talks about her oldest son as “Always going against the convention. Had an incredible imagination, invented things in his mind all the time. Always looking for ways to do things differently. Was very sensitive, hated school, always wanted to escape to find other things to do, very bored at school, very inventive. Wonderful with horses, extremely talented rider, can fix anything but was never taught [how].” One of the hallmarks of a Star Kid is great imagination abilities. The ability to see things that are not in front of you, the ability to see things as they might be, the ability to see into the future and how things likely will unfold. This flexible viewing system tends to militate against just blindly doing the same old thing. How boring. Let’s see if there is some different way to do things.
35



Such a gifted imagination also allows for inventiveness: to look at a problem and envision how it could be solved. And such inventiveness is part of the reason Star Kids often get into difficulty in conventional schools. The difficulties the oldest boy had in school are very familiar themes I hear from so many Star Kids and parents: chronic boredom with school, hating school (but not learning), the ability to do complex tasks without being shown how. Such a conflict is almost inevitable when an advanced Star Kid is placed in a school system designed for the average (not the bright) “normal” human child. And some Star Kids get bored even in the “gifted school programs” designed for superior “normal” humans. Current ordinary schools certainly are not designed for the Star Kid, whose way of learning is more “matrix”, and not so linear. Star Kids acquire (input) information matrix-style; they process information matrix-style; and they express/share/output information matrix-style. “Matrix” here means handling experience, life, data, and information in ways which are non-linear, multi-modal, cross-disciplinary, parallel-processing on two, three or more tracks. Let me give some examples. Samantha, a seventh-grade student, has an assignment to write a short report about the witches in old England. Samantha may get calm and meditative and then use her intuition to get a “feel” for what it was like to be a witch in medieval England. She may then remote-view an English village that was known for its persecution of witches. She might then go to the library and get a book on witches, or go to the Internet, or consult an encyclopedia. And she might look in the Yellow Pages and call up a modern witch and ask her what she thinks. Samantha might then put all these inputs into her mental “cauldron”, so to speak, and stir vigorously, and see what comes up for her report. What Samantha is doing is a tame example of matrix-style information input acquiring. Let’s follow Samantha into the information-processing part of how she handles information. She is now assembling her report. She does not write it like most kids: lining up some historical facts and a quotation or two, and then writing a conclusion. No, Samantha may well start with the report’s conclusion. And she might base that conclusion on the “feeling” she got from the class textbook section on witches, and combine that with what she learned from remote-viewing that persecutory medieval English village. Samantha might then go to the beginning of her report, and start out with what the modern witch she talked to had to say about being a witch, and the prejudice one has to endure even today. She might even recast her report from being about not-so-Merry Olde England to instead tell about the continuity of persecution of Wicca practitioners, natural herbalists and psychics from medieval times to the present. Samantha might use some magickal numerology to assign numbers to her report not in sequence (1, 2, 3, etc.), but based on how the power which the numbers selected exert so as to weave a spell around the report, and turn the very report into a magickal instrument.. In the body of her report Samantha might combine: 1) quotations from historical accounts contemporary with the time of the witch-burnings, with 2) a medieval witch spell for protection against one’s enemies, with 3) an Anglican minister’s sermon against witchcraft, with 4) a crosscomparative account of the Salem witch trials in America, with 5) a page or two from Samantha’s own diary from the days when she dabbled in Wicca magick. Samantha might then stir all these ingredients, add a pinch of wit, a dash of sardonic commentary, add a heartfelt poem about being the misunderstood outsider with special powers which ordinary people fear, envy and reject; and serve bonfire-hot to her teacher and the class in an oral report (in crone costume).

Let’s take a different Star Kid to show how they express/share/output information matrixstyle. Jorge, nine years old, is assigned by his Cub Scoutmaster to tell the newer Cob Scouts about how you follow a trail in the woods. Jorge might start by stating the basic conventional principles of staying on the trail, picking the better-traveled path if the trail forks in two, reading rock cairns as signposts of the direction the trail proceeds, using a compass, etc. But then Jorge might also talk about methods not so conventional, like using a pendulum or dowsing rods to determine which fork in the trail to take when the correct fork is not marked. He might also talk about using hunches (intuition) to tell which is the right way to go. If he got impassioned about his presentation, he might diverge from the assigned topic to talk about how to make yourself “invisible” if you come upon a bear, or using telepathy to tell the bear that you mean no harm. If he momentarily forgets the limitations of some of his audience, he might talk about the time he was late on a hike and “shoved time together” (time compression), so that he arrived at his destination at trail’s end on time. In Chapter 13 we shall explore some of the elements of a proper education for Star Kids. Suffice to say here that a Star Kids School will not resemble the current conventional school. In fact it may not to the untrained eye look very much like a school at all. But more about that later. Are Star Kids doomed to be pigeon-holed as “Geeks”? It might seem so, except for this one fact. They are rapidly becoming the majority. Actually, numerically, Star Kids are already the majority in the juvenile population. But many of the Star Kids are “Latents”, because society does not recognize and provide ready identification for them, or because they have not yet woken up to their full potential, or because they are cowering “in the closet”, trying desperately to pretend to be “normal”, to fit in unobtrusively, and be socially accepted,. So, therefore, at this moment the out-in-the-open Star Kids are still a minority, and subject to being ostracized and labeled “Geeks”. But the Star Kid Tidal Wave just keeps on mounting. And more and more, awareness is starting to spread through the larger community that these special kids exist in sizeable numbers, and are to be prized for their ways and their future contributions to society. Today’s Star Kids are a major Transitional Generation. This is the Generation that will participate in the shift of society from a predominantly old-Normal majority to a predominantly Star Kid majority, as more and more Star Kids come in, and as more and more Star Kid “Latents” already here “wake up”. “B” describes her oldest Star Kid as having “a very high IQ and a misfit, always questioned things! Now he’s 26 and trying very hard to be conventional. Not doing all the crazy things he did when he was young.” The development of a clear and positive identity is one of the crucial tasks of childhood and adolescence. A major expert in this area, Dr. Erik Erikson, described the process of forming an identity as follows. Identity is “the confidence that one’s ability to maintain inner sameness and continuity ... is matched by the sameness and continuity of one’s meaning for others....” Erikson goes on to note, “Thus, self esteem ... grows to be a conviction that one is ... developing a defined personality within a social reality which one understands” (Erikson, 1959).
B’s oldest Star Kid son evidently has long struggled with the challenge of being perceived as different, of not fitting in. As this lad tried to shape his identity, he had the problem of deciding whether to be true to all of who he is (and wearing the identity of being a Star Kid with advanced abilities), or putting social acceptance ahead of personal integrity (and wearing
37



the identity of a Normal Human.) This young man chose the latter. Yet, as a developmental psychologist, I can tell you that the time will come, be it the early mid-Thirties personal reassessment, or the later late-Forties/early Fifties famed Midlife Crisis, when this young man will be confronted again by the tension and falsity of his provisional “solution” to the tug-of-war between personal identity and social acceptance. If he again shirks his true identity at that time, he is most likely to proceed into his senior years a man haunted with underlying currents of regret. It will be fabulous when we arrive at the day when Star Kids can feel free to operate “out of the closet” freely and relaxedly, acting naturally in their special powers, and not having to worry about public ridicule and social ostracization. “B”describes her middle boy as having “a problem with drugs. I think it’s his way of coping. He’s now 31. Ultra-sensitive, gentle and caring.” There is a good chance that the mother is correct. That the middle son is having painful difficulty finding himself in the world, since the current society is a “Fourth World” model, and Star Kids are built to function well in a Fifth World expansive, caring, cosmic society. And that he is using a very common Fourth World coping mechanism, drugs (which include alcoholic drinking), in order to cope with the disappointment that is the current Fourth World. This is a real tragedy. The potential of this Star Kid is masked, and rather smothered, under the mental haze and desensitization that drug abusers seek in order to get relief from their problem situation. Drugs cripple the mental sharpness and sensitive psychic attunement that a Star Kid needs to use his advanced abilities. But some Star Kids, faced with ostracization, ridicule, self-misunderstand, being misunderstood by others, and feeling alienated from society, and lonely and isolated from finding others like themselves, (because so many Star Kids are “Latents” or in the closet), find it all too seductive and convenient to just tune out and drop out via street drugs. Star Kids who find themselves in more advantageous environments (say, in a loving family who understand and accept them in their specialness), as well as adult Star Seeds, should look for opportunities to reach out to these “lost” Star Kids. To let them know they are understood, that they are accepted, that they are valued, that they are not alone, that they have peers who want to associate with them, and be their friends. Earth cannot afford any lost Star Kids. But well-meaning Star Kids also need to recognize that some fellow Star Kids, who get into drugs, are going to need the help that only a professional counselor can provide. It is not always possible for a well-meaning young person to effectively reach an addicted youth. Such Star Kids may well require a counselor who is open to understanding the special problems, and potential, of being a Star Kid. Such counselors are not found on every corner. The same observation can be made about Ala-Teen and Narcotics Anonymous chapters. There are no guarantees that a given meeting will contain a fellow Star Kid or adult advisor hip to the Star Seed scene. The improvised solution may have to turn out to be a combination of “standard”
38



treatment coupled with some side peer counseling and peer support from strong and clean-andsober Star Kids. There is another sub-set of Star Kids, especially teens, caught up in trying to find their true identity and true place in the world, including the world of psychic realities, who find themselves drawn towards experimenting to see if psychedelics help. These consciousnessaltering drugs include: peyote (psychedelic cactus), psilocybin (“magic mushroom”), lysergic diethylamide-25 tartrate (LSD, “acid”), cannabis (marijuana), ketamine (“Special K”), datura (Jimson weed/ loco weed), ecstacy (MDMA), Morning Glory seeds, Nitrous Oxide, cocaine (“coke”), Iprocin/Iprocetyl (“4 Aces”), dimethoxymethylamphetamine (“STP”), ayahuasca or yaga (DMT) , and phencyclidine (“PCP”). [PCP is not a true psychedelic, but a veterinary tranquilizer hallucinogen.] These Star Kids hope to find answers through chemical altering of their consciousness. (Additional note to a minority of Teen Star Kids temporarily hormone-overwhelmed): the above listing is for informational and discussion purposes only, and is not a recommendation, nor an endorsement of, choosing to take hallucinogens as an underage person. Nor is it an endorsement of ingesting a hallucinogen at any age without adequate mental, spiritual, physical, and environmental preparations, purpose and focus; nor without a learned, wise and experienced adult mentor committed to be there all through the experience. And even then, realize it is a risky venture.) Some Star Kids take psychedelics because they feel stuck in trying to find out who they are, (given their different, multi-layered world). And it is so very important to them to find out just exactly who they are. And so, some Star Kids are tempted to use the consciousnessexpanding properties of certain psychedelic drugs to try to get a chemically-assisted peek under the veil of ordinary reality and see what is beyond – and to see whether such a vision will help them nail down who they are. Psychedelics can provide a peek under the veil, or outside of the Matrix. But the truism so many of us learned on the streets of the Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco and on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley (CA) in the Hippy Era of the Sixties is still as valid today as it was then. What you get out of such voyaging does not exceed what you bring into it. If you are messed up in your life, LSD will only make more intensely and painfully obvious just how messed up you are. If you don’t have a sense of your own identity, mescaline may show you some curious images of surrounding reality, but it will not leave you any clearer about the you in the middle of that surrounding reality. If you are wondering whether you are a Star Kid or not, or what being a Star Kid really is all about, and try to use peyote or datura or ayahuasca to find out, you may get so side-tracked by the visions of peyote, or the body-dissociation of datura, or the vivid hallucinations of ayahuasca, that you end up no clearer than when you started. And maybe a whole lot more confused. What has been said above goes as well for alcohol abuse, glue-sniffing, and the other low-consciousness substances that some people use to forget their uncomfortable lives and try to
39



stop bad feelings. You cannot find enlightenment in booze. You cannot find out who you are inside a paper bag of fumes. You cannot really get away from societal misunderstanding or scorn by numbing out on Coronas. If a Star Kid wants to get clearer about who she or he is, they need to get solid information about being a Star Kid, such as found in a Star Kids Project, Ltd workshop. They need to have a cross-learning experience with other Star Kids ready to talk seriously. They need to use their interior powers of “seeing”inside themselves, intuiting their position in society, psychicly “feeling” the qualities which distinguish them and other Star Kids they know from ordinary humans, and telepathically communicating with Star Nation Elders, in order to assemble the self-knowledge, the cosmic vision, the societal wisdom, and the felt sense of proud identity, to be clear about who they are as a Star Kid. And Star Kids need Star Seed mentors. In Fifth-World cosmic society a-dawning on Earth., there will be plenty of Star Seed mentors. These mentors will be set up and available to lead Star Kids coming-of-age through a new set of peri-adolescent Rites of Passage to help inculcate in those Star Kids a firm grasp of their identity. And a firm foundation for operating as a Star Kid in the world. Until that happy day, that learning will take place at select Star Kid workshops, via accurate Star Kid lectures, by reading real Star Kid books, and by associating with Star Kid peers, including at Star Kid summer camps. And even by special events, such as a pilgrimage to sacred places, and there engaging in a Vision Quest facilitated by spiritual ritual, and facilitated by a Star Seed mentor. Still other Star Kids get into trouble with alcohol or other drugs, or pathological social withdrawal, because they are confused about the advanced powers they have that no one else around them seems to have. Some kids hate the feeling of being different. They want to hide, or to fake being “normal”, or ignore and deny their ESP abilities. But the personal cost of denying who you are, of pretending that parts of you don’t exist, is so great that the human spirit recoils in pain and dis-spiritedness. And some try to find a chemical antidote for such pain. But nature will out. A Star Kid cannot forever hide from who he or she is. Is being a Star Kid a disease? Of course not! But the way some people act, you would think it were so. There are Star Kids who get sidetracked because they feel estranged from primitive, savage Earth society, and hope that in the altered state of consciousness which psychedelics bring, that they might find some answers. This psychedelic strategy is roughly the equivalent to finding yourself in a burning room and grabbing the hose to a gasoline pump instead of the fire extinguisher hose. In other words, it may not only not help, it may make your problems worse. And yet other Star Kids, even young ones, find themselves on prescription mind-altering drugs for quite different reasons: because society thinks they’re weird, or because society thinks they look an awful lot like a biologically-impaired regular human. In some such cases, the Star Kid is being inappropriately diagnosed and given inappropriate treatment. Being a Star Kid is not a disease. Nor is it a mental disorder. Let’s be clear about a few things.
ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) does not just come along with being a Star Kid. Just because a Star Kid is brimming with energy, moves impatiently from one thing to
40



the next thing that catches his/her interest, talks very animatedly, and speaks shooting ideas out more rapidly than another person might be able to easily follow, gets bored with simple things and wants to move on to something else potentially more interesting, all this does not necessarily mean that that Star Kid is hyperactive in the clinical sense of the word. Some children as small as three years old are on Adderall, an amphetamine, or Straterra or Ritalin or some other medication prescribed for Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Now if a child truly has ADHD, then a medication may be one way of helping the condition. But it is a real shame when a healthy Star Kid gets dosed with powerful, mind-bending, mood-altering, and energy-depleting drugs just because of someone’s ignorance about what is normal in a Star Kid. Star Kids are sharp. They are highly energetic. The cruelest torture you can administer to a Star Kid is to leave them stuck in a boring situation. And so many things that might appeal to a “normal” human child their age are boring to the advanced mind, maturity level and interests of a Star Kid. It is also likely that more careful attention to their adequate intake of essential nutrients, and curbing their exposure to unwise chemicals, may also help the Star Kid manage his energy in his human body.
Attention-Deficit Disorder (ADD) does not just come along with being a Star Kid;
although it may sometimes look that way to the casual observer. Star Kids are rapid processors of most information (unless it is extremely complicated.) Because they process things so fast, some teachers think that the Star Kid is not paying attention to what is being taught. In class they confuse the Star Kid’s getting a new concept almost instantaneously, and turning her attention to something else, with not paying attention to the subject. If this happens often enough, and it does, some teachers may draw the conclusion that the child has Attention-Deficit Disorder. The teacher may send them to the school psychologist for testing, or send a note home to the parent suggesting that the child be seen by her pediatrician to get help (medication). What fastprocessing, mentally-nimble Star Kids need in most cases is understanding, not Ritalin, Adderal or Strattera. And these Star Kids need an education which is suited to their abilities and pace. If Federal law guarantees disabled children an equal education by special accommodation to their unique learning needs, then public policy should be that highly-able children also deserve an equitable education by special accommodation to their unique learning needs
Childhood Depression does not just come along with being a Star Kid. Some children as young as seven are on Prozac or some other antidepressant medication, such as Zoloft, Paxil, or Effexor. While there are a few children with genuine endogenous (body-caused) depression, many more Star Kids are depressed because of the circumstances surrounding them in which they must live. In these cases, intervention to change the toxic aspects of their environment, and counseling for the Star Kid’s injured sense of self, and putting some understanding social support system in that child’s life, offer more effective strategies for improvement than putting a pill in the kid’s mouth and sending them back to the home, the school, the neighborhood, the peer group which is causing the depression. With Star Kids, what may look like clinical depression often has more existential and personal overtones. A Star Kid who feels forlorn, abandoned and isolated from his star family
41



(extraterrestrial kin from a previous incarnational existence) may exhibit some of the same symptoms as Childhood Depression: feeling sad or empty, diminished interest in doing daily activities, trouble regulating sleep, listlessness, lack of energy, trouble concentrating, and wishing to stop the miserable existence. And yet, in some key ways, there are other, different symptoms, symptoms which are not consistent with clinical depression. A Star Kid will not deep down have feelings of worthlessness, but more the opposite: feeling like they don’t know what to do with their special gifts. The Star Kid will often not be preoccupied with death or morbid thoughts, but rather how to escape Earth (alive and in one piece), and how to get back to their family in the stars. The Star Kid will not so often have diminished ability to think or concentrate, as she will find herself dwelling inordinately on matters relating to her home world in the stars rather than her immediate surroundings on Earth. Autism (and its country cousin, Asperger’s Disorder) does not just come along with being a Star Kid. True Autism is a developmental disorder. “Approximately 75% of children with Autistic Disorder function at a retarded level” (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Some Star Kids start off “slow” in early childhood, or at least it looks that way, because they are getting used to being on Earth and functioning within the limitations of a human body. Therefore, the child may be absorbed with getting adjusted to his physical environment; (and therefore run the risk of being labeled “disconnected from reality”.) And he may expect that his parents or others will “get” the telepathic messages he sends to them, and communicate back with him telepathically, as he was used to when he lived in a Star Visitor culture elsewhere, in a previous incarnation. He may then decide that the lack of telepathic response from his Earth parents means that he had the bad luck to get a set of “autistic” parents; (and therefore he runs the risk of being labeled “noncommunicative”, because the child decides not to bother trying to communicate with such “communication-impaired” parents..). The Star Kid may find his age-“peers” so far behind his mental/psychic/spiritual development that he finds them uninteresting to play with, or not worth conversing with; (and run the risk of being labeled “failure to develop peer relationships” and “lack of social imitative play”.) The Star Kid may be gifted in abilities and talent in certain restricted areas of interest, and ignore or pay little attention to other areas most “normal” children take interest in; (and therefore run the risk of being labeled “preoccupied with restricted patterns of interest that are abnormal in intensity or focus.”) A clinician who lacks skill in dealing with Star Kids, and who is too hasty to impose the “order” of neat psychopathological diagnoses on obscure clusters of behaviors, may well end up diagnosing such a child as “autistic” or as having some other developmental disorder. This is a tragedy, and can be the occasion of great suffering for a Star Kid and her/his parents and family. While there most certainly are genuine cases of children with developmental disorders, it is important that we not get so trapped inside the unseen, Earth-bound cultural prejudices about what constitutes normal development and behavior in a child, that we mislabel a Star Kid as a defective human. Different is not defective.
42



When it comes to getting accepted by the dominant society, it might really help if Jon Stewart did a comedy sketch interview with a couple of Star Kids on his The Today Show (on the Comedy Channel.) When people are laughing and seeing friendly fun poked at willing Star Kids, much progress could be made in taking the fringe and “loony” stigma off Star Kid identity and presence in our society.
Race, Socioeconomic Status, Star Kid Identity and Success
It may come as a jolt to readers of European descent but the language which is the primary language of the most people in the world is Mandarin Chinese. And the second most prevalent primary language is Hindi (India). English comes in third place, being the primary language of 341,000,000 people. In the United States, where I live, we have a veritable melting pot of many racial and ethnic peoples. Those who tell the Census Bureau that they consider themselves “White” constitute 75% of the population. Additional numbers of people identify themselves as Hispanic/Latino (one in eight), and another one in eight identify themselves as “Black” or African-American. 3% are self-described Asians. One percent are Native Americans/Indians. Star Kids come in all colors, ethnicities, cultures, and mixtures. But in a country like America, which has struggled since its beginning with defining citizens not of European descent as fully human and fully equal, the cultural struggles and ambiguities of racial identity affect the lives of Star Kids and their development. Are Star Kids who are African-American or Mexican-American or Asian-American or Native American any different than Star Kids of European descent? Yes and no. Mostly no. That which makes Star Kids distinctive, their subtle physical differences, their acute and sharp and complex minds, their double-handfuls of psychic/ESP abilities, and their cosmic spiritual sensibilities, these remain constant from one ethnicity to the next. Although it may be a disappointment to the Aryan Nation and the Ku Klux Klan, there is no White Supremacy in the Star Kids phenomenon. On the other hand, it would be disingenuous to pretend that “race doesn’t matter.” By this is meant that in America, as well as in other countries where one ethnic group has historically had the favored position in society and another ethnic group the less-favored status, of course “race matters”. That is to say, those factors which come with racial prejudice have an impact on the ethnic group(s) placed in less-favored caste(s). Such invidious factors include: being seen as less capable; being provided a poorer education, or more readily shunted to school programs designed for students with problems; adverse discrimination in employment; social restriction to circles other than the “in-crowd”; the psychological pressure of carrying an identity which the opinion-makers in your society consider inferior; the psychological pressure of never knowing which of your encounters with a member of the favored ethnic group is going to be tinged with
43



prejudice or exclusion; greater difficulties in meeting, dating and marrying someone from the more-favored ethnic group; and for those in the business world, subtle barriers to customers and markets dominated by the more-favored ethnic group. Obviously, a Star Kid would have to be made out of granite not to feel the influence of such discriminatory factors. And beyond hurt feelings and psychological pressures, an “ethnic” Star Kid has dual identity challenges. She or he is not only an ethnic minority in a Whitedominant society (like in the U.S.) , the young person is also a Star Kid in a society which knows nothing about this Star Kid reality, and is conditioned to brand such claim-of-identity as crazy and foolish. But, as the Tao masters have observed, in every challenge is an opportunity. The same skills which persons of ethnic minority status have used to emphasize their normality when amidst dominant-group persons can help when Star Kids decide (selectively) to let others know of their full identity. And the minority-group person’s use of humor and selective selfdeprecation to help the dominant-group person feel not so intimidated, distant or estranged in their presence can be borrowed by Star Kids as a coping strategy to make their way in the larger society. And Star Kids should not be afraid to utilize their special abilities to help things go more smoothly. For instance, psychically projecting relaxed friendly feelings into the mind of the regular-human person(s) being talked to, so that the other person relaxes and treats things as more normal. But of course using telepathic remote-influencing in a dating situation to try to get the regular-human boy (or girl) you like to like you is no fair, unethical, and ultimately doomed to fail. Pressuring someone to love you is not real love, which needs no outside pressure to exist. What has been observed about ethnic-minority Star Kids can also mostly apply to Star Kids who come from poor families. In every society, “money matters.” More than it should. It is obvious that Star Kids who grow up in poverty are going to have special challenges. They will not have ready access to some of the resources children from more affluent social strata have. Things like a personal computer. Or regularly-available transportation to the library. Or enough money to go to special events like UFO conferences or psychic fairs, where information is available that can help the Star Kid figure out her place in this world. Star Kids’ abilities are not going to resolve their family’s poverty. But it is not a dead-end trap. Intuition, and telepathic guidance from one’s Star Visitor guide, for example, can help steer the Star Kid to particular people and events where the child can have growth opportunities. And Star Kids who are born into bodies with brain damage or underdevelopment, or who have deficient neurological wiring (as in Cerebral Palsy, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gherig’s Disease/Motor Neuron Disease, etc.), or physical challenges such as paralysis or blindness face yet other hurdles. What? Can there be a “retarded” Star Kid? Can a blind Star Kid still succeed? Certainly! As many talented nurses and social workers have observed, it seems that in a number of developmentally-delayed (DD) children, it is as though the brain “underdevelopment” restricts the volume of cognitive chatter that goes through so many normal persons’ minds, and thus allows the DD child to focus less-distractedly on the incoming psychic
44



impressions. Thus, such a Star Kid might well astound family and friends with being aware of and knowing things that the child has never been exposed to. Or he might tell the future, even if he has to stammer a bit to express himself. And just as the sensory deprivation of a blind person causes their hearing to become more acute, in a Star Kid such a sight-loss might actually create dramatic possibilities for the non-sighted person to intuit or remote-view where the edge of the curb is. Or “see” auras more clearly and less distractedly. Etc. Star Kids come in all sizes, shapes, colors, personalities, social groupings, religious backgrounds, neighborhoods and countries. Star Kid is an equal-opportunity upgrade. The outof-the-closet Star Kids (and adult Star Seeds) are apparently a minority in Earth’s population at the present moment. But, given the ongoing trends of incoming Star Kids per hundred births, and increasing numbers of “Latent” Star Kids “walking up”, the numbers of fully-aware and consciously-operating Star Kids (and Star Seed adults) will very soon constitute a highly-visible majority in the human population. As this occurs, society will undergo the most profound transformation since Homo Sapiens Sapiens gradually supplanted the earlier-model Homo Sapiens.
Star Kid Sensitivity
[A letter from a grown Star kid:]
“Dr. Boylan,
“Your excerpts from your new book [Star Kids] are wonderful! It will be a pleasure and treasure to read when it is completed.
“The one thing I was curious about is if you will include information about the emotional sensitivity of Star Children.That was/is one of the hardest parts for me. There were so many times I HATED being so sensitive to the moods of others.
“Well, you know all about it. But for me, it was like watching people through binocularseverything they said to me was so exaggerated and I took things too personally. If my father was upset about work, and he spoke to me with even a slightly elevated tone in his voice, I would cry for hours in bed that night as the tape went over and over in my mind.
“I often wondered if that replay was a part of the "gift" as sometimes it almost acts like a time machine in that I can return to events as an observer.
“As I grew older, and after way too much needless emotional sorrow, I finally learned to not take things so personally.
45



“Anyway, I felt prompted to share this with you in hopes that other little sensitives can be advised on this before they cry too many tears while alone wishing they were "home."
(- an adult woman who grew up from Star Kid to Star Seed)
One of the first things one often hears about a Star Kid is how sensitive she or he is. We are not talking here about the sensitivity of a pubescent going through the teenage hormonal changes, and the emotional roller-coaster that entails being ready to burst into tears or snap at a parent if the parent happens to choose the wrong word in commenting on the pubescent’s appearance or behavior. Rather, the sensitivity that so many Star Kids manifest is based much more deeply. The reason for such hypersensitivity is due to several things.
One factor is that many of these Star Kids are incarnating in a human body after a previous lifetime, often many lifetimes, as a member of one or other star civilization. It tends to be the nature of those star civilizations, (some of whose members volunteer for an incarnation on Earth to help humankind), that those star civilizations are more philosophically and spiritually advanced. Because of the higher spiritual and metaphysical development which star citizens bring with them when they incarnate as an Earthling, they experience life on Earth as a rude shock.
I cannot tell you the number of times that I have had Star Kids (and Star Seed adults) tell me that they never cease being appalled at the coarseness, the violent tendencies, the insensitivity, the heartlessness, and the uncaringness of too many humans.
The experience is something like a college-age Freshman woman driving home from university on her first Fall Break, and having her car break down just as she is crossing through an impoverished, drug-infested section of a city. She goes into the only building open for help. It turns out to be a pool hall. She spies what looks like the proprietor behind the bar and decides to ask him to use the phone to summon a tow truck. On her way from the front door towards the owner, she is subjected to racial taunts and sexual cat-calls; she is pawed by several men; another yanks her purse away and goes through it looking for money. She will need all the luck in the world to make it to the proprietor without ending up spread on the pool table and gang-raped.
Awful as the picture I have just painted is, if you can imagine that young student’s feelings of fear, degradation, humiliation, violation, revulsion and alienation, you have some of the picture of the emotional shock and adjustment that is involved in coming from a much more advanced civilization to Earth. Even if a given Star Kid ends up growing up in a decent family in a self-respecting neighborhood, she or he still sees what is going on around them: on television news, at too many schoolyards, and in other neighborhoods and countries.
I have found myself saying to Star Kids and Star Seeds on many occasions, as they pour out their tales of unpleasantness endured, “Coming to Earth is doing hard time.” It is a phrase I use to capture their feeling. I have yet to have any of the star folk disagree.
46



Now, I am an Earthling, too, and I am sensitive to what I have just written above. Naturally we humans like to take pride, justifiable pride at that, in the advances we have made in our civilizations over time. When we look at the diorama of a Neanderthal village in a museum of natural history, we shake our heads and smile at the primitiveness of live depicted there. Fastforwarding to more modern times, and just focusing on Western civilization as an example, we take pride in the many good features and improvements: the rule of law instead of impulsive actions by vigilantes; and the creation of charitable organizations to take care of children who have lost their parents, or ones which care for abandoned pet animals; agencies which provide food, clothing and shelter for the poor; public clinics which provide basic medical care for the indigent, and which provide psychiatric care for the deranged and suicidal, and public organizations which provide assistance for impoverished areas overseas. We tell ourselves we are a just and caring society, peaceful unless attacked, democratic, where people of every race and nationality have a chance to get ahead.
So, what are those Star Kids and Star Seeds whining about, someone may ask. So what is the big deal about how hard it is to incarnate and live among us?
Well, for one thing, there is often a gap between the ideals our society professes to live by and the actual lived experience on the ground. The illustration drawn above about the 18year-old girl stranded in a crime-infested neighborhood is not far-fetched. The story was taken out of the daily paper, and, by the way, the girl was gang-raped and nobody in the bar, including the bar-keeper said or did anything to try to stop it or to call for help. And it was not a ThirdWorld country; it was Massachusetts, USA. And it was not in the ghetto or barrio either, but rather in a working-class Italian-American neighborhood.
Certainly there are stranded persons who reach out to strangers for help and receive it. And there are Good Samaritans every day stopping to help a woman change a flat tire, or who take up a collection for a family whose house just burned down. But there are still too many instances of bullying, racism, stealing (by people in business suits as well as by desperadoes), sexual harassment, child exploitation, abuse of power, and just plain uncaring in the face of dramatic human need.
So, yes, Star Kids remain appalled by the uncaring that goes on in supposedly advanced human societies. (In this they are joined by the Star Visitors, who are equally appalled.) The Kids cannot understand how a wealthy society like the United States can stand by while millions starve or perish from AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. The Star Kids are distressed when a story appears on television of a poor man who froze to death on a tenement doorstep, while people stepped over him, and hurried on to their warm homes. These Kids wonder how they can be remotely related to humans who chain an African-American man to a car back bumper and drag him several miles to his death. Or those who tied a college-age boy to a fence with barbed wire and left him naked in a blizzard to die. The Star Kids are incensed and afraid at the bullying that
47



goes on in some schoolyards, where tough children harass younger, smaller or weaker children, taunt them, or steal their lunch money.
The Star Kids accept others of different races and nationalities, and wonder why too many humans make such a big deal about interracial dating. These advanced children look into a person’s inner energetic signature and determine whether that person is of the light. That is what matters. Whether a fellow Star Kid is male or female is not a huge deal, and certainly not a basis for discrimination. And skin color, well, when you have lived a few lifetimes in the cosmos, there is little room for idealizing one skin hue as ideal or “normal”.
The honor system is something that a Star Kid inherently understands: and that if someone takes advantage of trust for selfish personal advantage, they dishonor themself, and that is serious punishment. The cheating and the lying that pass for “ordinary behavior” these days is painful to a Star Kid to see. And yes, Star Kids respect proper authority, but are keenly sensitive to the abuse of authority and position, whether it be done by a parent, a teacher, or a cop. Star Kids understand that social responsibility and justice are high values, and that those who abuse the position and the trust given them dishonor themselves. Personal honor and integrity are commanding values in star civilizations, and are such among the Star Kids here on Earth as well.
Another strong emotion which Star Kids experience is the strangeness of feeling different than the norm, of being different than the rest of humans. Just as earlier we reviewed the various challenges that ethnic minority status or poverty or physical limitations present in feeling different from the crowd, Star Kids have the challenge of being secretly, or not-so-secretly, different than many of their age-mates, relatives, fellow students and friends. Most Star Kids I’ve met nonetheless carry themselves with dignity, energy, pluck and joy. For the rest, who find it more difficult to cope with, the remedies can be these:
1) Star Kid lecture, where the whole Star Kid phenomenon is laid out, and Star Kids get a chance to feel clear about themselves and “normal”;
2) Star Kid Workshops, where identity is confirmed, special abilities enumerated, explained, and practiced in a supportive atmosphere; and the Star Kid gets to meet other Star Kids and see what normal, appealing youngsters than can be;
3) Special counseling about psychological and emotional problems that certain Star Kids get stuck in, such as the challenge of reconciling their exquisite sensitivity with a brutish and stubbornly-ignorant parent or school setting;
4) this book (Star Kids), which in some ways was written to be a self-help manual for Star Kids and their parents, among other things.
5) Finding other Star Kids, hanging out with them, talking and learning from each other.
When I think about the situation of Star Kids in today’s society, kept blind to public awareness of and acceptance of these realities by the shadow government’s UFO Cover-Up and
48



control of media content, the song that springs into my mind and heart is that old traditional African-American Spiritual, adopted by the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, “We Shall Overcome.”
So let us reproduce those poignant words here:
“We shall overcome, we shall overcome, we shall overcome one day;
Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe, we shall overcome some day.
“We’ll walk hand in hand, we’ll walk hand in hand, we’ll walk hand in hand some day;
Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe, we shall overcome some day.
“We shall all be free, we shall all be free, we shall all be free some day;
Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe, we shall overcome some day.
“We are not afraid, we are not afraid, we are not afraid today;
Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe, we shall overcome some day.”

Chapter 4
Psychic/Metaphysical/ESP Abilities of the Star Kids
Many little children around the world like to play the Pokemon card game or video game. For the few adults on Earth who don’t know who or what Pokemon is, Pokemon are adorable baby (pocket) monsters with magical powers. There are decks of playing cards with a different Pokemon figure on each. Kids play against each other, using their Pokemon with their mystic abilities to challenge and counter the attempts by the other player to engage with his Pokemon powers. Although there are hundreds of Pokemon, many with combat powers like throwing flame, there are 21 psychic Pokemon, whose repertoire is to use their advanced mental abilities to good effect upon those they engage. It is pertinent here to identify six psychic Pokemon out of the 21 such figures, with help from my 13-year-old Pokemon expert Star Kid consultant, (who says he has since graduated to Yu-Gi-Oh! cards.) Abra is a telepathic mind reader, and can teleport himself. Kadabra projects brain waves to give opponents headaches. Alakazam has an IQ of 5000, also can teleport, and can project confusion waves. Drowzee is talented at hypnotic sleep induction and is a dream-eater. Hypno also has talent in hypnotic sleep induction. Then there is Mewtwo, whose specialties are: setting of psychic barriers, the psychic creation of mist, and psychic inducing of amnesia. There are Star Kids who can themselves do what these fantasy figures pretend to be able to do. One wonders whether the creators of Pokemon had become aware of Star Kids in Japan, and decided that these kids were ready for toys that operated at their advanced level. For, Star Kids are perhaps most dramatically distinguished by their psychic, ESP, psi, or paranormal powers. Because the psychic is the realm which ordinary people feel is reserved for a favored few, for the oddball, for those “into witchcraft” (sic), the average person does not feel that this is part of ordinary life. Ordinary humans often feel a mixture of awe, fear, and envy around those who are able to do mysterious psychic feats. Out-of-the-closet Star Kids have double-handfuls of these psychic abilities. Anyone who is around them for an extended period of time is likely to notice something different and unusual about the Star Kid. Even though the Star Kid may wish to keep such advanced gifts out of sight and unnoticed, rare is the Star Kid who completely succeeds at hiding such abilities. Some of these advanced powers are charming. Things like healing another person’s ache, or knowing a stranger’s name when they come up to meet the Star Kid for the first time. Other special abilities can be downright spooky. Powers like psychokinesis, where the child causes an object to rise up and fly across the room, or self-levitation from the floor. The Star Kids have these powers not to show off, but because such powers are part of an expanded repertoire of senses, strengths and protections that enable the individual to operate with a wider variety of choices. These gifts are part of being more fully alive, more completely conscious, more engaged in a community of transparency, connectedness and service.

As with other Star Kid attributes, psychic powers provide yet another dramatic example of where the human race is headed in its development. What are seen as oddities and curiosities now will in a generation hence be the widely-prevalent basis for Fifth World, the new incoming cosmic society. As in other ways, the Star Kids now provide a preview glimpse into the future face of the human race.
Psychic sensitivities will also play a major part in the accelerated awakening of “Latent” Star Kids. As more and more Star Kids and Star Seed adults come out of the closet, and weave together a new kind of social grouping by use of telepathic communication, this shared mindfield becomes more intense and noticeable to other Star Kids. Like a beacon, it both draws others to the Star Kids, and it serves as a diaphanous telepathic network that provides Star Seed with a sense of belonging, and even a home away from home.
Let’s take a closer look now at the array of these talents and what they mean. We’ll start with a letter from the mother of three Star Children. While her daughter’s capabilities are above average for a Star Kid,, the daughter reminds us of how
A mother of a Star Kid writes about her special child:
“Having three daughters after medical science told you that you were sterile is a message. They are special.”
My reply:
“Yes, I know that. But thank you for confirming.
Mom:
“Olivia is quite concerned about returning to school this year. She (unfortunately) is not going to be able to attend the school she did last year, as we have bought our first home.
“She did an amazing thing yesterday which in it's entirety is too much to tell.....but what it boils down to is she healed an almost dead rabbit after one of our dachshunds had cornered it and ripped its back leg and tail off. I wrapped it in a towel and put it out of reach of the dogs to die in peace.....I came home later to dispose of the body and it was gone. I asked Olivia] where it went, and she said "back home"; he won't come back in our yard, we had a little talk...he won't ever hop the same, but he will be fine"......NOW, how's that for an amazing little star child????”
My reply:
“I love her!!
Star Seed Transformation, Advanced Abilities, and Their Use For the Common Good
We just saw a description of what one Star Kid, Olivia, has as a special ability. Now, I'd like to in a systematic way go through some of the transformative changes that occur so often in Star Kids. These transformations also occur often in experiencers who have been deeply touched
51



and modified by repeated contact with the Star Visitors. Then I want to go through these special abilities again, noting not just the oddness, the differentness, the amazingness of these changes,
but also what the social purpose is, what the spiritual purpose is, of exercising these abilities. And then I think we get down to the punch line: not only of where our development is headed, but why the Star Visitors, ( most of these cultures with more highly spiritually advanced consciousness), are investing time and energy in trying to help us reach our full potential. They respect the fact that we have that spiritual and metaphysical full potential built into us, and they'd like to fan that flame and see it reach its full design potential.
So bear with me while I suggest a list of things. You might in your own personal experience go down and tick off which items on this list apply to you.
- Mental telepathy is unspoken thought communication, both incoming and outgoing. Everybody who has had Star Visitor contact had the incoming form of telepathy. That's the only way, usually, that they talk to you. And it makes for deep social connection. Telepathy is not usually transferring sentence strings-of-words into another person’s mind. More often it consists of sending across a total impression. For example, instead of sending across the sentence-string, “I’d like you to go over to that table near us and bring me back a glass of water,” a Star Kid might just place in the other person’s mind an image of that person with a glass of water in their hand walking over towards the Star Kid smiling.
- Precognition means knowing the future. Sometimes it takes the form of “hunches” that just happen to come true, time and time again. Sometimes it comes in the form of a flash of a vision, or even a sustained vision, of an event or situation off in the future. Psychics who work with precognition will tell you that attaching a time-line (“date-stamping”) the foreseen event is the hardest part of precognition. Some of the difficulty in determining when a foreseen event will unfold is because so much of the future is contingent on human decisions not yet made. And because free will is involved, people in the future can be likely to do “A”, but then change their mind at the last minute and untypically do “B”.
- Telekinesis and psychokinesis. The ability to modify things by focused mental effort alone. The classic example is lifting something up. Some of you have seen that movie, "Bless the Child," where the little girl rotates an object in mid-air just by mental thought. There it is. A number of Star Kids could do that, and affect other kinds of physical objects. (I'm a "psychic dunce," as they say. But I've been known to cheat a little on bowling, when the bowling ball's going down the alley and headed for the gutter- I project a pushing force a little bit on this side, a little bit on that side, until it heads towards some pins for a score.) Some of the Star Kids have admitted to me that they use psychokinesis to “help” a pinball game go better. Or a basketball actually fly into the hoop.
- Penetrating intuitiveness. Being able to see into a situation and know exactly what's going on with the agendas without anybody briefing you; to see a story in the paper and know just what's going on behind the scenes making that happen. Or looking at a person and just getting a clear impression of what's going on with them.
52



- Aura reading is seeing and reading the bio-electromagnetic-photic field around another person, (or animal or plant, etc.) We all have auras around us, a kind of visible illuminated diaphanous halo around our body, most noticeable in the head and shoulders area. People can be taught how to see the aura. And of course, the more you practice, the more you develop the ability. Being able to read an aura is a potential which can readily be put to good use. Aura-reading is not only seeing colors around another person, but to see where the field is fuller or diminished, or even has little bits of absence. As you learn to tell these things, you can learn such refinements of interpretation as being able to diagnose mental or physical illness, for example, by differences in the aura around a person.
- Psychic diagnosis is the ability to obtain information about a person’s health condition by nonphysical and non-medical means. In one common approach, the person being diagnosed lies flat on a couch. The psychic diagnoser passes his hand over the other’s body about 2-3 inches out from the body, and feels whether there is any change or anomaly in the energetic field which emanates from the patient’s body. Sometimes the anomaly in the field takes the form of a cooler (or warmer) area than the field as a whole. Sometimes it takes the form of an energy “spike” in the field, either a significant up-tick in energy or drop in energy. Some Star Kids do not have to use their hands at all. They just stand in front of the person and get an impression. Sometimes the impression is in their mind. Sometimes the Star Kid feels it in her body as a twinge or other noticeable spot that corresponds to the same place in the patient which is actually hurting or ill. Some talented Star Kids don’t even have to be in the same room as the patient to get a good reading on them. Or not even in the same town, the same state, or same hemisphere.
- Psychic healing. The ability to achieve healing in another person without medical instrumentation and medicine. The antidote (or successor) to medical school, in some cases, if you will. Psychic healing is done in a variety of ways. Some Star Kids (and adult Star Seeds) draw energy from cosmos/Tunkasila/Creator above, and also from Mother Earth below, then draw that energy into their body, and finally direct it outward. They often use their arm as a channel and the vertically-uplifted palm as a outlet, directing the healing energy towards the place in the patient which is ill or injured. We don't want to throw out all allopathic medicine. It has its place. But it isn't always going to be available during the Times of Transition up ahead. And then, there are some things allopathic medicine can't fix, (such as fulminating cancer, advanced AIDS, and blindness), which psychic healing can. So, it's like you have two hands. Yes, you can cut off one and still function, but most people would rather have two. We can use both psychic healing and appropriate modern medical advances (some of the latter advances inspired by back-engineered Star Visitor technology.)
- Remote viewing is otherwise known as clairvoyance. This is a skill which enables the Star Kid to see people, places, events and situations which are not physically present, or which took place in the past, or in the future. It is a mental journey across the space-time fabric to a different set of coordinates, and a viewing of what is going on there. For those readers who are ready to throw up their hands and exclaim that this is impossible, let me assure you that your hard-earned tax dollars have been funding research, development, and deploying of CIA, Army Intelligence, and
53



DELTA Force remote viewers, trained in classified government installations, since the 1970s. And they have had enough success that they are used for elite missions, such as locating where Saddam Hussein was hiding, and the crash location of a downed UFO. All the while the U.S. Government has had public affairs officers stoutly proclaiming that there is nothing to remote viewing, and that the military have closed the program as “unproductive”.
Star Kids do this well. Why should the Army intelligence have all the fun? They're not that good at it. I mean, just think about those two words: "Army intelligence."
- Invisibility work. This refers to the psychic power to make oneself invisible. In highly adept individuals, this involves making oneself objectively optically invisible. More commonly, such invisibility results from exerting mental influence on the people around you so that they just don’t seem to notice you are in the area, although technically they could see you if they regained their perspicacity and paid attention in the zone where you are standing (or sitting). Imagine this power in the hands of a ten-year-old child. You're a parent looking for him, it's time to come in and help straighten up his room. Now, where did that kid go? Star Kids have told about playing such invisibility pranks on parents or friends.
- Teleportation. This is the ability to have an object that used to be in one place relocate by pure mental concentrated effort, and now be over in another place. Some very adept indigenous shamans on Earth can do that. Some Star Kids and experiencers can also teleport an object. One of the uses I have heard most frequently about is finding a lost (or stolen) object. Let’s say that the errant item was a treasured silver medallion given by a favored aunt. It was resting on the dresser and now it’s gone. The Star Kid might focus on the object, visualize it carefully in his mind, send out mental “reaching” towards the object, and draw it gently towards its former location on the dresser. He might also set an intention that the object have time to relocate and appear the next day in its rightful place. And then next day, lo and behold, there sits the medallion on the dresser.
- Levitation. Antigravity without the antigravity craft drive. More specifically, levitation refers to the psychic ability to personally gently and slowly rise off the ground without use of any physical force or means. I know of a six-year-old Star Kid, Katrina, who has the practice of daily meditation. She sat cross-legged on a floor mat in a quiet alcove of her house. One day her mother walked quietly by, peeked in, and saw Katrina floating several inches above the floor.
Some Star Kids (and Star Seeds) and other psychic adepts can make another person or a solid object float above the ground. But this is not true levitation, but rather projected telekinetic force.
- Mental influencing. This is a special use of mental telepathic thought-transfer, placing a thought or idea or suggested behavior gently or strongly into another person’s mind to influence them to
54



think or act in a certain manner. If that other person is not psychically aware, they might even think that the thought or impulse is their own idea.
My favorite example of mental influencing is in the first "Star Wars" movie, which came out almost three decades ago. The Imperial storm troopers come marching up to Obi Won Kenobe and Luke Skywalker, and the two droids they have with them. The storm troopers are looking for the droids, because they contain downloaded information that's dangerous to the Empire. It's terribly important to the Rebel Alliance that the droids not be captured. And so, as the Imperial captain marches up, Obi Won Kenobe thinks telepathically to the captain - (and you can hear it in the sound track) - "These are not the droids you want." And sure enough, the captain turns around to his men and says, "These are not the droids we want." And then Obi Won says, "We have no further business here. It's time for us to go." Then the captain turns around to his men and says, "We have no further business here. It's time for us to go." This is a cinematic illustration of the art of mental influencing. Genuine mental influencing is interpersonal, is done within ethical boundaries, and is used for helpful or at least harmless purposes. The following is an analogous example. A Star Seed in an internet group tells the other members that her husband has suddenly fallen ill and faces emergency open-heart surgery in the morning. The Star Seed sends out a request for all those Star Kids and Star Seeds on-line to send thoughts of support, strength, and positive expectation to her stricken husband. On a slightly less altruistic plane, a Star Kid told me about mentally influencing her mother to allow her a second helping of dessert.
Now, there are less-lovely applications of mental remote-influencing. Covert rogue units positioned within military intelligence organizations have developed physical electronic devices which exert a substantial force on the brains (minds) and emotions of selected human “targets”. This is used for everything from trying to demoralize the “target” to getting the unfortunate person to think or feel a certain controlled way. Such use of psychotronic machines for dire control purposes by Shadow Government “assets” is not what the gift is for. And real natural human remote influencing doesn't need electronic circuitry to accomplish anything.
- Earth energy adjustment work. Star Kids, utilizing spiritual psychics, have done some work to try and smooth out some of Earth's energetic and physical perturbances. This includes such things as trying to calm down hurricanes that are beginning to develop, or smooth down tectonic plate movements, so the earthquakes that are building up won't be quite as violent, or trying to smooth Earth energy field disturbances from all the nuclear weapons and pollution and wars which resonate with Earth, and smooth that energy out. Mother Earth, Gaia, is after all a conscious organism, as even some of our physical scientists have now conceded (Lovelock, 2000).
- Time dilation or contraction. This refers to the application of psychic/mental force to alter the amount of time during which an event occurs. An example of time contraction, for example, is making a journey a lot shorter that it normally would be. That is to say, to go from one town to another on a trip that should take an hour, instead takes a Star Seed driver 40 minutes without any speeding or short-cuts. Time contraction is done when it's terribly important to get there more quickly than “possible”. Is that possible? Yes. Time dilation involves application of psychic
55



power to fit more of an experience into a limited time frame than is ordinarily “possible” to do, that is, to “slow down” the passage of time, because what is going on is very special. As an example, a seventh grade Star Kid was out at night aboard a starcraft attending an important briefing on upcoming events and his role and mission in them. Yet he has a book report to write for his school class, and only fifteen minutes until the school bus comes. Ordinarily such a report would require the Star Kid to spend an hour. Yet the Star Kid does a respectable job on the report and has it written by the time the bus comes.
- Pre-sensitivity to earthquakes or human disasters (such as an impending car crash). This gift is a special kind of sensitivity to such turbulent events. It is not so much a seeing (remote viewing) of the future event, but an internal feeling in the Star Kid’s body. Sometimes this takes the form of a vibratory feeling, or an ache in one part of the child’s body. Over time, the child learns to associate that special vibration or ache with a disaster event that later appears on the news, or happens to the child and her family.
- Interdimensional awareness. This refers to being able to sense beings from another dimension. Or being able to move across the "dimensional barrier" and sensing what's going on in another world. Other dimensions exist. Our advanced physicists and mathematicians have calculated that there may well be 11 dimensions, (e.g. Edward Witten of the Institute For Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey) A number of Star Kids have this ability to perceive beyond our conventional three dimensions-plus-time (a fourth dimension). Since some of the Star Visitors inform us that they come from other dimensional space, a Star Kid’s ability to see crossdimensionally is helpful in engaging in contact.
Needless to say, military intelligence organizations seek to harness this ability also, but to do it using technology. The film, and then popular television series, Stargate/SG-1, is not quite as fictional as viewers might think. In fact, I was recently given some information by my exNational Security Agency (NSA) contact that this technology has been achieved at Los Alamos National Labs (LANL). There an interdimensional portal has been created using extremely highpowered holographic technology. LANL have sent a person through. On the other side, the test subject accessed another world. What he saw both intrigued and unsettled him. One of the scientists involved in this project was Dr. Wen Ho Lee, a scientist who several years back became famous in the headlines. It wasn't nuclear secrets that the government was actually worried about Dr. Lee being careless with. That was just the “cover story”. Dr. Lee reportedly knew about a lot more delicate stuff than nuclear bomb designs, (by now a 50-year-old technology.). Because Dr. Lee was involved with the interdimensional portal project, LANL felt it very important to keep his mouth zipped tightly shut. Some Star Seeds whom I talk to are amused by how the government and the military always have to construct elaborate machinery to attempt to duplicate the psychic feats which come naturally to so many Star Kids.
56



- Astral travel, out-of-body travel. This is the ability which involves a person’s consciousness/self/personhood leaving their physical body and going elsewhere in space and/or time for a while. Star Kids frequently know how to this, or the experience just happens with them spontaneously.
Many of us as experiencers, and those of us who are researcher-therapists, have run across astral travel as one of the preferred ways in which Star Visitors make contact with humans. If I make an oversimplified template of how contacts go as a pattern, often the Visitors soften up the beachhead with a physical encounter. They show up in the flesh and the experiencer says, "Oh, my God, they're real. They're visiting me." After she gets over that, often the subsequent encounters take place in the astral, out-of-body mode. The Star Seed is lying in bed, her body stays in bed, and then her conscious self goes elsewhere, maybe up on a craft, is with them, gets information, has communication, is shown things, then comes back down into the physical body. She finishes sleeping, and wakes up in the morning with information and memories she went to bed not knowing. And for the Star Visitors, out-of-body travel is a lot easier than running antigravity discs through U.S. military radar nets, trying to get down to Earth’s surface and physically bring aboard craft one or more persons from the Earth's surface - and more efficient.
- Close mental connection with a Star Visitor guide. This is not so much a psychic ability as a special companionate experience which tends to generate psychic abilities. This experience happens in one of several ways. One of the more common is a Star Visitor consciousness coming within the mental space of a human Star Kid or Star Seed and being present temporarily or longterm as an additional consciousness presence. Typically the Star Visitor (disembodied) consciousness visits to serve as a Guide to the Star Kid, and/or to learn more about Earth civilization as experienced through the Star Kid’s perception. In an alternative way, the human involved has a quasi-fatal accident or illness and the human’s self/consciousness/soul is slipping away. A Star Visitor utilizes the opportunity to slip into the human body before the body finishes dying, and provides continuity of life and a consciousness presence to the body which suddenly therefore comes back to life. This is sometimes reported as a “miraculous recovery”. Many Star Visitors who have volunteered to incarnate on Earth at this critical time in our history to help humankind make it, have entered the human population in this way. A great number if Star Kids remember their previous incarnation on another world. And they bring many of the special advanced energy and abilities with them for this lifetime in a human body.
- Affecting electric/electronic appliances. This is not about the passive influence of a Star Kid’s bio-electromagnetic-photic field on such mundane things as a street light, (as we discussed in an earlier chapter.) Rather, what is referred to here is the conscious directing of mental and/or
57



physical energy so as to affect the operation of an electric device or the circuitry of an electronic device by affecting its electromagnetic field. Star Kids have done things like get dead flashlight batteries to work.. Or getting a broken radio to work again.
- Cross-species communication. An ability to telepathically and intuitively connect with another species, be it terrestrial animal, or plant, or a Star Visitor race. The communication includes receiving messages from the other species and sending messages. This communication can be, as several Star Kids have told me, knowing what their pet is thinking and feeling. Or making mental connection with a dolphin at Marine World. Cross-species communication with plants is part of the process some Star Kids use in doing healing work with sick or “dead” plants.
- Psychometry. This involves the ability to learn some information about, say, a person by handling some object, such as the person’s keys or a piece of jewelry they have worn. This is based on the understanding that all objects carry a frequency “signature”. In doing psychometry the Star Kid connects her frequency with the frequency of the object.
Social and Spiritual Applications of These Advanced Abilities
If you read this menu of things to the average citizen who has not been indoctrinated in the psychic paranormal reality that is the familiar world of Star Kids, they would think you're talking science fiction - if they don't think you're talking "looney bin." But, it's not only real, it's personal for millions of Star Kids (and Star Seeds) around the world.
Now we're at a different phase in our human social evolution. Now it's going public. Now it's going across society. No more shamanistic elitism. Our kids, many of them, are being bred with these characteristics as a given. It keeps spreading. And as the reproductive genetic spread goes on, it will become normative in society. The folks I work with at Star Kid Workshops are merely the vanguard of what our whole population is going to look like in probably the next couple of generations. If you want to see Fifth Society, that’s what you'll be looking at.
Now, why the gifts? Let me suggest some social purposes, the social and spiritual uses of these gifts, that give these special abilities their nature as gifts for humankind. These psi powers are not just for showing off, and certainly not given for purposes of empowering one set of individuals to lord it over the rest, or to seek to control the rest. Because we are a social species, there is a varied distribution of abilities and talents among the population. No one person has every ability. The distribution which nature unfolds in the population is designed to assure a widespread availability of needed special powers on occasions of need. The distribution also assures a general empowerment, with no one individual all-powerful.
58



Here then is a brief discussion of each of the special powers discussed, and an example or two of their potential application for the social good.
- Telepathy. Star Kids (and adult Star Seeds) share mental telepathic ability. When in a group, such starfolk create a shared mental field, a mind-field commons. Such an environment fosters honesty, transparency, trust, openness, mutual availability, mutual caring. It’s no use trying to hide anything; you just look evasive, and are mentally exposed to others anyway. Such mutual telepathy is a major building block in creating Fifth World cosmic society, with high values of transparency, trust, and caring, such as one finds in a non-dysfunctional family.
- “Sensitivity” or precognition. Star Kids with such developed talents are sort of like the Indian scouts of old, up in the trees saying, "There's buffalo over that next hill. Let's go get 'em and have something to the tribe to eat." The precognitive “Indian scouts” of Fifth World Society will be seeing probable futures, because no future is absolutely cast in stone. They're highly probable, based on current circumstances confluencing together in the most likely way. That's as close as anybody can get to the future, because of free will and chaotic, often somewhat-random interpinging of events. (Even for a subatomic particle at Los Alamos, our scientists can't say for sure whether the particle going go through one grid or another, because of the "uncertainty principle.") Anyway, we have probable futures. And if the precognitive experts in our “star tribe” can point that out, that allows us as a society to say, "Hmmm, unless we do something, such and such is going to happen. If we'd like it, fine, let's keep on doing what we're doing. If we don't like it, whoa!, let's see what we can do to change it." So, it is easy to se that there is a benefit to society from that kind of ability.
- Telekinesis. We're moving to a stage of mind over matter - mentally-assisted vehicle guidance, for instance. That technology already exists. Many experiencers have "taken the wheel," if you will, in a saucer, and after a little coaching mentally guided it in doing its maneuvers. The better Star Visitor civilizations do it by mind alone - there's no joy stick. Some of our advanced classified military fighters and fighter pilots are doing that, only they use helmet technology which has been adapted from Star Visitor technology. They think, and their helmet accepts their electroencephalogram waves without wires, by radio pickup, and translates the signal into aileron and rudder control in the craft. That's not quite mental telekinesis, but it's pretty close; it's a mechanical model of it. In actual telekenesis, a Star Kid has stopped a heavy rolling cart that would have otherwise injured another person.
- Penetrating intuitiveness. Social discernment could be one benefit. If all of us can pick up when something is "loaded" - it's not right, and there's some hidden agenda - it's going to be much

harder to pull a lot of political and social scams that are now floating successfully. Maybe in Fifth World there will be a new political party - the No B.S. Party. What a refreshing idea.
- Aura reading. This allows each Star Kid to discern the other people around her. How are they doing today? And if they're coming from an unsettled, dark place, she can spot that. If they need a little help, be it physical or emotional, it can perhaps trigger her psychic healing or telepathicallydelivered empathy.
- Psychic diagnosis. Imagine this more general ability to detect illness, injury, or disease by scanning the field which each person’s body generates. In a Star Kid Workshop I conducted in 2003, Star Kids were readily able to run their hand over the boundary of the energy field around a volunteer patient (with a real, unrevealed illness), and determine where an illness was located. In one case the patient protested that he had no illness in a left shoulder area identified as a trouble spot. Sheepishly the patient contacted me a couple of weeks later, and said that he had developed a soreness in the precise area spotted at the Workshop. Evidently that Star Kid was sensitive enough to detect an injury whose effect would not be felt for several weeks.
- Psychic healing, remote healing. What good is psychic diagnosis without psychic healing for the malady diagnosed? Earlier in 2004 I taught a siblingship of a brother and sister to do psychic healing of their mother, (after they had successfully learned to do psychic diagnosis.) The mother had incurable ovarian cancer, and had told me privately that she was not expected to make it, but had not shared that part with her children, so as not to frighten them. Imagine the stunned joy I felt when five months later the mother phoned me up to say that her cancer was gone!
Now imagine everybody as a "barefoot doctor" to everybody else, as the general population becomes Star Kids and Star Seeds! (“Barefoot doctor” refers to a practitioner class in China in earlier decades who, with modest training but dedication to serving the rural poor in remote locations, made sure that even the poorest had basic medical services.)
Psychic healing is also useful in going beyond traditional medicine for situations where you can't get to traditional help Or in situations where traditional medicine has nothing more to offer. Or maybe as an alternative choice, when a person would be rather be healed psychically than visit their doctor. Also, psychic healing is not confined to situations where the patient is present in front of the psychic healer. Where circumstances prevent that, for example the patient is cut off in a disaster from being able to get through on roads, psychic healing can be telepathically and telekinetically projected to the distant patient.

- Remote viewing. A Star Kid told me of remote viewing an automobile crash that would happen to his family if they got in their car for a weekend drive. He warned his mother who would have been driving a certain route. She avoided that route. Later the family read in the paper about a terrible wreck that occurred to someone else at the same location foreseen by the Star Kid.
More generally, society will benefit from these Kids’ ability to engage in seeing the past, or the future, and learning from past mistakes, or seeing future probabilities, and fostering good possibilities with supportive energy.
- Invisibility work. In certain situations, a person may need protective privacy. Star Kids and adult Star Seeds have foreseen a turbulent future in the next few years, where fascist regimes will take over, and much of America will be subjugated. In such times of peril, the ability to be undetected by the new generation of Storm Troopers could be a distinct advantage. And Star Kids who avoid a general round-up into “holding centers” will thus be around to fight for freedom another day.
- Teleportation. In the turbulent times ahead, teleportation would be an attractive option for those important, urgent deliveries that just can't wait for FedEx, if it is even available. And given the Time of Transition just up ahead, there will be circumstances when FedEx won’t be around to make the run.
- Levitation. If you fall off a cliff, it might be nice not to have to go all the way to the ground. One Star Kid told me of being surveilled and followed by a cluster of three white vans and a dark Chevrolet Suburban. It was clear these were federal agents, or a rogue unit trying to appear as such. As the lead white van crept up at five miles-per-hour within yards of this 17-year-old boy, as he walked down the street, deliberately intimidating him, he became frightened and somehow triggered some super-strength he had, bolted many yards in the air, up a hillside and over a chainlink fence and landed on his feet in the center of a basketball court. The federales in the white van were so spooked by this feat that they broke off surveillance and sped off.
- Mental influencing. Star Kids can use this ability to encourage and support those people who are doing difficult work. You know, it doesn't have to be mind control. It can be supportive and friendly, giving somebody in a tough place a little extra boost from the outside. A number of people on a Star Kids/Star Seeds communication list which I facilitate, UFOFacts at Yahoogroups.com , have placed a request on-line asking for other Starfolk to send positive and supportive mental messages when the member had a difficult medical challenge to address.

- Earth energy adjustment work. With the earth changes coming up, we're probably all going to have to get fairly busy to modify some of the rather dramatic cataclysms that otherwise are building. With many Star Kids and Star Seed adults potentially available for this important task, it will be important to “wake up” all the many “Latent” Star Kids, who still don’t know who they are, or what their powers fully are.
- Interdimensional awareness. Some of our visitors are coming across dimensions, and when we see them, we're not just seeing somebody who came in a high-tech vehicle from another star system. We're seeing folks who jumped dimensions. Often they have trouble getting into thirddimensional density here. They are kind-of fuzzy on the edges of our three-dimensional world. It's as dense as they can stand being without getting a migraine. If we starfolk can reach across halfway and meet them with some interdimensional awareness, the connections are that much easier to make.
- Connection with Star Visitor Guides. Star Kids and older Star Seeds have talked with me about having special “guardian angels” offer some suggestions and hints for us. As Fifth World society accepts the reality of these star-being Guides, our society is going to be that much richer for having their wisdom and guidance.
- Out-of-body travel/ Astral travel. That's how remote viewing works. This is a preferred way of doing a lot of contact with the Star Visitors, and other contact. One such instance of nontraditional contact, achieved by out-of-body travel, is connecting with relatives who have departed this life.
Some Psychic Exercises for Star Kids (and Star Seed Adults)
Psychic abilities develop with practice. Those who do not practice often find that a psychic power they have is unpredictable, occurs without conscious control, or is not very well focused. Here are some simple, straightforward exercises which will help a Star Kid develop his or her psychic powers, allow them to have a focus, and be responsive to conscious direction.
- Aura Viewing.
Have the child look at a person standing in front of a mirror, or a blank wall, preferably white or a light color like beige. Have the child concentrate on beginning to notice the outline of an energetic/ luminous/shimmering field around that person's head and shoulders. See how far out it extends. Is there a color to the field?
62



- Psychometry Exercise.
Fashion a lightweight pinwheel of paper or thin plastic, and suspend it on a stick where it can rotate very freely. Place the whole apparatus under a glass bowl or other transparent enclosure. Have the child concentrate on moving the pinwheel solely by focused mental effort and/or personal energy transmission.
- Remote Viewing Exercise.
Draw or cut out a simple line drawing of a basic geometric shape, such as a circle, rectangle, pyramid, or five-pointed star. Place this drawing in a sealed plain envelope. Prepare an additional symbol in a second envelope. After sitting the child down in a quiet peaceful space, and giving him/her time to quiet and focus, show the child the first envelope, and tell her that there is a simple drawing in there. Tell her that the game is for her to go inside the envelope with her mind and tell you what she sees there. After she tells you, have her try the second envelope with its symbol. Note that some children's mind, not yet adept at crossing space-time dimensions, may travel to the second envelope when they think they are seeing inside the first envelope. Any approximate identification of the symbol is correct. This is an area of skill-building. And even the government's most proficient remote viewers do not always get their visual targets correct or complete, especially at first.
- Silent Interpersonal Communication/Empathy
Have the Star Kid sit across from you, or some other person. Without either saying a word, gently maintain silence and general eye contact, (not a stare-down.) Have the Star Kid pick up on what the other person is feeling, or their general state of being or health today. After several minutes, stop and the Star Kid can relate his perceptions and get feedback from the other person.
- Telepathy Exercise.
Have a volunteer available at a somewhat distant location who will hold one clear and distinct thought or image in their mind for several minutes. Have the Star Kid sit quietly in a room by themself. Have them focus on the remote individual, and gently pick up what that person is thinking, or what image is in their mind. Report the results back to the volunteer for on-the-spot cross-checking of how close the Star Kid came in picking up the mental impression.
- Pendulum Exercise.
First, select a pendulum, or make one of your own. Something as simple as a pendant of quartz crystal suspended from a string will do. "Calibrate" the pendulum by determining what motion it will make to signify a "Yes", a "No", and a "The-question-cannot-be-answered-yes-or-no"
63



response to a simple question to which the pre-known answer is "Yes" or "No" or "Question is not a Yes or No question". In many cases the pendulum will make a circular motion in one direction
for "Yes" and in the opposite direction for "No", and will go back and forth in a line for "Improper Question". In yet other cases the pendulum will swing back and forth in one direction for "Yes", in another for "No", and may move circularly for "Improper Question". After the Star Kid has calibrated the pendulum, then he is ready to ask a Yes-or-No question to which he does not already know the answer. For purposes of learning, it might be useful to have the Star Kid ask a question where information about the answer can be cross-checked, say, in the encyclopedia or on the Internet. A word of caution: some questions which seem simple and could be answered yes or no actually, upon careful analysis, have embedded assumptions or sub-questions within them, which prevent the ability to answer the question with a straight "Yes" or "No".
- Dowsing Rod as Power Detector, Information gatherer
Dowsing rods have many uses and applications, some of which have already been mentioned in an earlier chapter. But here is another exercise for your Star Kid to do. Use the dowsing rods and slowly walk in a straight line through the house looking for ley lines and vortices. Have the Star Kid use the dowsing rods pointing forward and parallel in front of her, and invite het to slowly walk in a straight line through the house. After finishing one line (axis), have her walk in another line, perpendicular to the first. These paths should allow her to intercept any energy line that may run partially or completely through the house. When the rods intercept an energy line, they will cross into each other, i.e., go "cross-eyed" If they intercept a vortex, they will start rotating. To find a vortex may require browsing all through a house, or outdoors all over the property. And the hunt may not be successful. But it is fun to explore.
- Psychic diagnosis
There are several ways to do diagnosis of ailment or injury. Some people do so by "seeing" into the person's body and spotting the ailment/injury as a place of different coloration. Another way is to detect variation along the boundary of a person's bio-electromagnetic field that surrounds the body. Have the volunteer with an ailment not tell the Star Kid where s/he is afflicted, but lie down on a couch, and have the Star Kid run their hand, palm down, from head to toe about two to three inches above the body, (wherever the Star Kid starts to feel the edge of the person's bio-electric field.) The Star Kid is to look for a spot or two of variation. The variation may take the form of warmer or colder than the average temperature feeling of the person's overall bio-electric field boundary. Or the variation may take the form of an energy spike or "slump" at one place in the field. That zone of variation is where the ailment or injury is located. A note: sometimes the Star
64



Kid will detect an injury that happened years ago, or, in one case I worked on, an illness that had not yet happened and was two weeks in the future.
- Psychic healing
Have the volunteer person seeking a healing rest horizontally on a couch quietly. Have the Star Kid rub their palms together briskly, quiet down, go inward and invoke assistance from Supreme Source in the cosmos, and from Mother Earth. Have the Star Kid visualize drawing in healing energy from the cosmos down from above through the Crown Chakra (energy opening at the crown of the head), and directing that energy to the Heart Chakra (heart), and then out through their arms and hands. Have the Kid visualize healing energy coming up through the soles of their feet from Mother Earth and up into the Heart Chakra, and thence out through their arms and palms. Visualize it radiating from their palms placed about 2-3 inches vertically above the spot where the ailment/injury is located on the supine resting patient. Sustain that energy- transfer/ healing for several minutes, until the Star Kid feels that enough has been accomplished.
- Telekenesis Exercise.
Have the Star Kid go t the arcade and play pinball. Have him focus intently on the ball and influence its path to go towards a particular scoring hole. Keep score. Compare “psychic” scores to unassisted scoring.
- Viewing across dimensions.
Have the Star Kid quiet herself, and sit facing forward. Have her open her mind to inviting contact with a friendly being from a dimension outside of our three-dimensional world. Have her spend a few minutes, and notice whether any image occurs at the corner of an eye.
- Precognition
Have the Star Kid look at a certain upcoming event, e.g., a political election, horse race, or camping trip, and "see" what impression they get from that future event. The Star Kid may get an impression of who is going to win, or if one of those involved will have an accident, or whether something unexpected and interesting interposes within the event. Write down the impression, and go back and look at it after the event has occurred.
- Penetrating Intuitiveness
The next time the Star Kid is in a fast-food restaurant, have her look around and see what impression she may get from someone in the restaurant. Usually there will be at least one person there in a crowd who pulls the Star Kid's attention by something they are sending out, or that is true about them.Look for clues which may confirm or disconfirm the original impression.
65



- Teleportation
The next time that something gets lost or misplaced, have the Star Kid reach out psychically and "draw in" the lost object to a pre-agreed-upon spot in the house, e.g., on top of a dresser, at a predetermined time. Give the object a day or two to "materialize" in the spot the Star Kid has strongly invited it to reappear at.
- Levitation
Let the Star Kid sit quietly on the floor, or lay quietly on the bed, in their bedroom. The Star Kid puts themself into alpha (altered) consciousness, and begins visualizing what it is like to become very, very light: so much so, that gravity no longer exerts much influence at all, and as a result, the Star Kid visualizes him/herself slowly, gradually, slightly not being as sunk into the chair or mattress. With further visualization and intention, the Star Kid slowly rises a bit more. Then holds it. Then slowly allows/visualizes sinking gradually back into the chair or mattress.
- Mental influencing
This is an exercise the Star Kid must be reminded can only be properly done in an ethical manner; (no violation of another's free will.) As an example, in class let the Star Kid strongly send out the telepathic message to the teacher to call upon the Star Kid next to answer the question. Or when the teacher is picking children for a fun assignment.
- Invisibility work
The Star Kid can go into a room frequently visited, but in which no one is at the moment, and sit quietly in a corner, and meditate and focus on creating a shield around her/himself that makes it extremely difficult for others to see or feel their presence. When another person enters the room, see how long it takes for them to notice that the Star Kid is there, too, (if at all.)
- Earth energy adjustment work
The Star Kid can go to a strong energy spot (vortex), or even just to a remote quiet natural outdoors location, and first feel what information Mother Earth is sending about the amount of discord/damage she is feeling. Then the Star Kid can focus, meditate, pray, drawing in energy from the cosmos, and direct it out of their palms in a healing, soothing way to some access point of Mother Nature, such as a monolithic rock, stream, exceptional tree, etc.
- Time dilation ("stretching" time to allow more done in a short span)
The next time there is a situation where there isn't enough time (normally) to get something important done, have the Star Kid concentrate and form powerful persistent intention that time stretch enough that time is not up until the important thing is accomplished.
66



- Time contraction ("shrinking" time)
The next time that the Star Kid faces an extended situation that she wishes would hurry up and get over, (such as time in a dentist's chair getting a cavity drilled and filled,) have her concentrate and form powerful persistent intention that the time just fly by, and that what took 45 minutes seems to have gone by in just five or seven minutes.
- Feeling the location/time of the next earthquake
Let the Star Kid go out and sit in the back yard on the ground, quiet himself and center internally, and then gradually tune into the Earth beneath him and her energy currents and movement. Feel where any stress and build-up of pressure and force is within the crust, and in what direction that pressure is located. Get out a map and note what lies in that direction. Over the next few weeks keep aware of any earthquake reports from that region.
- Inter-dimensional awareness.
A Star Kid can sit quietly in a somewhat darkened room, get into a meditative state, respectfully invite in one of her Star Visitor Guides, and request to be able to see him/her. The visibility may be just out of the corner of the Star Kid’s eye.
- Out-of-body (astral) travel
Let the Star Kid sit quietly in a chair, or lay quietly on the bed, in their bedroom. The Star Kid puts themself into alpha (altered) consciousness, and begins visualizing first mentally going out above the Earth and over to another locale. As the mind starts to travel, feel the body becoming very light and less attached. Allow the body to remain quietly in the chair or on the bed while the essential the Star Kid (soul/spirit/consciousness) travels to this other locale, looks around, immerses herself in that place, its look, colors, temperature, feeling, events. Remember what is seen and felt there, and then gradually transit back to where the Star Kid left their body. This exercise works particularly well if the Star Kid travels to a place where there is someone they know, whom they can call up later and ask what they were doing at the time of the astral travel visit, so that the impressions of the Star Kid can be cross-checked with the person visited.
- Affecting electrical/electronic appliances.
67



This exercise involves the Star Kid temporarily causing an orange sodium vapor-plasma street light to go out on purpose. Stand near/underneath a sodium vapor-plasma street lamp and begin to focus intently on the gaseous vapor being ignited by the tiny filament. The vapor sends out light only because it is highly excited/charged. Form strong intention, and send out a correspondingly strong visualization that the plasma "collapse" back into the quiet non-luminous state the gas was in before the light was turned on. Keep this up until the orange streetlight goes "out". For extra credit, give it (and yourself) a minute or two, and then do the above steps, except in reverse, thus ultimately turning the street light back on. Ssend out the strong visualized intention that the gas become ignited by the filament and return to its highly-excited plasma shining state. Keep this up until it happens. It may take a long while at first.
- Cross-species communication.
Get your pet, or a friend’s pet, quiet them down, get into a meditative state yourself, then reach out with your consciousness and intuition and feeling and see what you pick up from the pet’s communicative thoughts or feelings. After establishing a link, try to give a familiar command telepthically rather than out loud. See if the pet “gets it”. For example, “Sit!”, or “Go to your bed.”
- Psychometry (reading objects by touch). This works by harnessing the Star Kid's psychic awareness, plus tuning into the energy pattern that someone leaves on the objects they touch or come into contact with. With prsctice the Star Kid will become better at gewtting information off the object touched by the person. This is analogous to a bloodhound going after a person based on old scent traces.
Let the Star Kid touch an object which belongs to someone he does not know, but the parent does, and feel what he can learn about the owner of the object: state of healthy, emotional state, appearance, etc.
- The other psychic abilities
There are many more psychic exercises. But these should keep a Star Kid out of mischief for a while. And remember: just like your physical muscles, the more you exercise your psychic muscles with these (and other) exercises, the stronger they become.
Out-of-Body Experiences/ ”Astral Travel”
68



People sometimes ask if the out-of-body state is a natural and reliable means of communications with entities not only in other dimensions, but also with Star Visitors living on other physical planets who travel here and monitor us in different ways? And if I could please elaborate on this?
The use of Out-Of-Body state, or “astral travel”, is a useful means of contact with the Star Visitors, whether the flesh-and-blood physical Visitors, or the less-solid ultra-dimensional ones, or even those beings who have evolved past physicality to exist as packages of pure energy, or pure light, or even just pure thought.
In fact, it is my research finding that the majority of close encounters with the Star Visitors are in the OOB/astral travel mode, particularly after the Star Visitors have “broken the ice” by an initial physical visit to the human experiencer.
Remote viewing (clairvoyance) is another way to “travel” and make contact with the Star Visitors. This involves not so much moving one’s astral body to another location as it does redirecting one’s consciousness to a “target”/coordinates which exist at a different location
The reliability of utilizing Out-Of-Body travel, or remote viewing, is a matter of the ability, skill, and practiced experience of the person so engaged. It is well to use a mentor in developing such skills, since there exists considerable capacity for misinterpretation of results and self-deception about what was experienced.
Above, we have engaged in a brief tour and overview of some of the advanced abilities which Star Kids have and often utilize. Again, it should be emphasized that no Star Kid has all these abilities. And that some Latent Star Kids may not be aware that they have any of these abilities. (Particularly if they have been brainwashed that such powers are “from the Devil.”)
But so many Star Kids do have a number of these abilities. And they are preparing, whether consciously or not, for the day when they will be able to freely use these abilities out in the open, and may even be requested and begged to utilize these abilities.

Chapter 5
Star Kid Spirituality
When people think about Star Kids, their attention might naturally be drawn to these children’s brightness, how quickly they grasp and process information. Or their extraordinary profusion of psychic gifts will impress other people as the most notable thing about the Star Kid. But the most important part of a Star Kid’s repertoire is not brains or wizardry – it is their spirituality. Let us be clear that we are not talking here about religion (per se). While some Star Kids go to church, synagogue, mosque, or temple with their families, very many Star Kids do not find in church that which nourishes their spirituality. It is not that these children are godless. It is rather that what they seek to connect to is deep and pure; and they find that formalistic ritual does not work to provide so many of them the connection to their spiritual source that they need. What is this spiritual source? “God” would be too facile an answer. Yes and no. The problem is that the many religions on Earth today have hijacked God, as though the Creator were a commodity owned and hawked by the clergy of a given religion. Furthermore, these churches have given “God” human characteristics: anger, jealousy, judgmentalness, and they portray God as a person who requires rituals to be appeased and convinced. The churches push themselves between the Star Kid and God, and maintain that they have the only way to get to God. Star Kids instinctively find all this churchery dull, boring, irrelevant, and a distraction from real spirituality. They find sitting through church services torture. They know that it doesn’t take a church to make contact with God. When Star Kids see religion turned into working-class bumper stickers, with slogans borrowed from milk ad campaigns, (such as: “Got Jesus?”), these kids want to puke. That’s not what religion is about. Well, what does a Star Kid understand God to be? Star Kids have an understanding about God which, not coincidentally, is commonly shared across star civilizations. As they grow and develop, Star Kids shake off the memorized formulations about God from Sunday School. As these children become more articulate, they begin to express that God is the Supreme Source of all. These young people might affirm God as something like an intelligent, aware, conscious principle that underlies all things. This God-force gives everything its distinctiveness, purpose, continuity of existence, and inter-connectedness to the other parts of creation. The Star Visitor races who have commented on the concept of "God" in answer to experiencers' questions, or who have brought the subject up themselves, uniformly affirm that they, too accept the reality of what Earthlings call God. However, the God they affirm is not the anthropomorphic or patriarchal figure of many Earth religions, but more of a Supreme Source [not precisely Star Visitor vocabulary] -- a transcendent matrix of Consciousness, which underlies everything, and is that which gives essence and specificity to everything, which in turn
70



is a partial manifestation of the Supreme Source. Even though our ancestors on many occasions mistook the highly-advanced Star Visitors for deities, the Visitors are quite clear, when confronted with human confusion about whether they are gods, and have emphatically clarified that they are not God. The Star Visitors typically do not make extended commentary about "God", but either assure the experiencer that they too accept "God", or they seem to let the direct experience of God speak for itself. In more experiential terms, the Star Visitors have taken experiencers and Star Seeds and shown them "God”. The experiencers typically described being in the presence of intense, overwhelmingly brilliant light from which emanates incredibly intense love, such that the experiencer feels lost in the infinite love. This Supreme Source is that from which life comes. Source is also that which provides conscious beings with continuity of personhood across reincarnations. Because Star Kids instinctively understand these truths, even though some cannot yet articulate them adequately, they know that the Supreme Source is directly accessible. No need for church; No need for clergy. Let me tell you a true story. There was a young Catholic priest, newly ordained, who was working in a parish in East White Plains, New York. He was approached one day by Kathryn, a beautiful young but troubled eighth-grade Catholic schoolgirl, who had a question. Shr started off by telling him that she found Mass (the Catholic church service) boring. She said she could not experience God at church. She was turned off by the people singing, the busyness of the incense smoke wafting in the air, the candles flickering, the priest droning his prayers. “Father,” she said, “I cannot find God in church.” Kathryn was almost tearful, and asked if her attitude was a big sin. The young priest asked her where she thought she would find God. She answered, “I have a favorite spot in the woods where I make my contact with God. I feel so close to God there. The forest is my church.” The priest asked Kathryn to show him where she prayed. They drove to a thick green woods outside of town by a little lake. There the girl sat at the edge of the lake in quiet meditation for 15 minutes. Then she turned around and looked up to the priest and asked, “Father, is it alright if I don’t go to church on Sunday, and instead come here to meditate and talk with God?” The young girl was a Star Kid. She also had instinctively been drawn to this young priest, who, it turns out, was an adult Star Seed. The Church had told Kathryn that it was a mortal sin not to attend Mass every Sunday. Yet she could not experience God there. But she did not want to commit a serious sin. The young priest’s eyes misted up, as he was at the verge of tears over her innocence, her purity of intention, her single-minded devotion to experiencing God. The girl’s sincerity and genuine spirituality were evident. “No,” he told her, “You do not have to go to church on Sunday. You need to have your connection with God. If this woods is where you can achieve that, then that is the important thing. You are dispensed from any obligation to attend Mass on Sunday.” The girl thanked him, and happily pursued her earth spirituality. The priest never saw her at church again. The young Star Seed priest, it turns out, was struggling spiritually himself. He was increasingly confronting within himself the same contradictions as the eighth grade girl was: that the many rituals, memorized prayers, and readings from the Bible, which were supposed to bring you closer to God, were just getting in the way, and actually turning him off and irritating him. The struggle of this pure young (Star Kid) girl resonated with his own struggle to disentangle genuine spirituality from the ritual and formulaic teachings he had grown up with.
71



Within a year he had resigned from the priesthood, left the Church, and pursued personal study of non-churchly spirituality and philosophy. He eventually developed a metaphysical understanding of reality which incorporated insights from Taoism and Zen Buddhism. His spiritual sensibilities also resonated with the understandings of Native American spirituality. This spirituality sees that everything in nature has consciousness, and is therefore sacred. That the proper attitude of a human towards the Creator is gratitude. That all creatures are part of the family of life. And that no matter a person’s age or skin color or national origin, and whether living on Earth or resident out among the stars, the ancient Lakota [Sioux] saying handed down over the ages was entirely true: “Mitakuye oyasin!” Everyone is my relative. That young Star Seed priest of almost forty years ago was me. And this true story is just one more illustration of how star folk help each other, because they resonate with the issues which come with being a Star Kid (or Star Seed.) That perspective, that energy, that drive connects them on a spiritual level. Star Seed young and old interact in a special and intense way because “All are my relatives.” The account above illustrates one path that one Star Kid followed to achieve the spiritual connection she needed to nourish and center her being. There are, of course, a variety of authentic paths which a Star Kid can choose among to meet his spiritual needs. Some Star Kids experience spirituality passively. An “angel” comes to them, often at night, and teaches them about how the cosmos is put together and interrelates. Over time, the Star Kid comes to understand in a word-less, gestalt-concept sort of a way, that there is an underlying creative intelligent evolutionary thought-force at work. This thought-force is permeating, unfolding, and organizing all those things which link together to form the tapestry of the cosmos. Several French philosophers have called this First Principle the elan vital, (literally “lifeenergy” (Bergson, 1907); and evolution creatrice, literally “self-creating evolution” (Bergson, 1907). Another thinker held that First Principle is that energy which causes the personalization of the conscious universe into cohesive and self-reflective awareness (Teilhard de Chardin, 1955). De Chardin further specifies that this primal energy is Love, defined as “the affinity of being with being” across the evolutionary order, and that it further explains why, (contrary to Marxian dialectical materialism), higher developments within the cosmos escape from the otherwise seemingly-universal physical principle of entropy (Teilhard de Chardin, 1955). It is not unlike what Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobe (of the original Star Wars movie trilogy) called “The Force”. And because both The Force and we are of consciousness, we are able to engage with The Force on his/her own terms. Does The Force require that candles be burned to Him/Her? Will The Force be offended if devotees fail to spin prayer wheels, or dance in frenzied circles a prescribed number of times a day? Is The Force happier when an animal is sacrificed in His/Her honor? Does The Force spend time continually stoking an enormous furnace, where those who go astray broil for all eternity? And if so, on what planet does The Force maintain this Hell? Or is it out in space somewhere and The Force has to import oxygen for the fire? The answers to these questions are pretty evident. The permeating creative intelligent evolving thought-force that some call God and others call Nature and others Great Mother does not need candles or prayer wheels or sacrifices. Father-Mother God is not interested in sending His/Her creation to some moral incinerator. God is the principle of life. And God is the principle behind the dynamic balancing and recycling of spent elements in nature. When it comes to beings with more developed consciousness, of course God would not have such a being live one

limited lifetime and then be annihilated to dust. And this Supreme Source is also the source of Love, the omnipresent unifying, interrelating, dialectically-entwining force of the universe. As the one responsible for the pervasive presence of love, Supreme Source both imprints the cosmos with his/her “flavor” of love, but by placing the energy of love within all sentient creation, Source givrs a powerful clue to his/her nature. The Star Visitors have offered humans they have visited some illuminating insights into the progression of the life path. Those Star Visitors who have commented on life-span have unanimously spoken of both Star Visitors and humans as having had previous lifetimes. And, following death after their current life, these Star Visitor or human goes on in most cases to successive lifetimes. Besides thus affirming reincarnation, the Star Visitors have also spoken about individuals voluntarily and consciously choosing to re-ensoul in another body, and to live another lifetime under specific circumstances. The subsequent lifetime is not necessarily on the same planet. Thus, Star Visitors have shown a human person , in some instances, the human's previous life as a Star Visitor, or their subsequent life in Star Visitor form. Also, the Visitors have shown a former Star Visitor to have chosen reincarnating into a human body to live a human lifetime. Indeed, some such "humanized" Visitor consciousnesses have deliberately come to Earth as metaphysical “missionaries”, to aid in humanity's advancement, via what I have termed “missionary incarnation”. The degree of consciousness and spiritual progress that a given soul/consciousness achieves in a given lifetime influences the possible choices available for that soul to have in a subsequent lifetime. There is no support in Star Visitor theology for the doctrine of only a single lifetime, after which the soul is judged and assigned a permanent fate. It comes as no surprise to many if not most Star Kids that reincarnation is a fact. Many Star Kids do have in fact some recall of one or more past lives. All not all of those incarnations were necessarily on Earth. Apparently it is the case that the vast majority of Star Kids growing up now are the result of “missionary incarnation”. This means that they were a Star Visitor in a previous lifetime, with the more advanced consciousness, mind, psychic abilities and energy fields which Star Visitors tend to have. These Visitors deliberately chose difficult duty: to incarnate in a human body on Earth at the end of the Twentieth Century and at the beginning of the Twenty-First, so that they could be here to help change the direction that the people of Earth are headed. When we talk about Star Kid spirituality, we have to include the tremendous love and unselfish giving that these Star beings have, and which they brought with them. Helping out with the awful mess which humans have made of the Earth and its gifts is a tremendous challenge. But these Star Visitors reincarnated as human Star Kids are up to it. Yet, many of these Star Kids suffer here. They hate the cruelty, violence, greed, cutthroat competition, and materialism which passes for civilized society here. Many Star Kids end up longing to go home, almost regretting having decided to come here. They long for the sweet, wise, loving, elevated people they left behind on home worlds. They cry at night, and look wistfully up to the stars in the direction they intuit that home world is. And yet they stick it out. I have talked to hundreds of these Star Kids, and the older Star Seed adults as well. I have listened to them, counseled them, and empathized with the stress, loneliness, fear, ostracization, and isolation they live with. And I have asked some of these if, after careful reflection, they would go home now. Almost every one pauses for a while, and then says essentially, “No. I’m here to do my work. I’m needed here. I’ll stay.”

That is dedication. That is service to high principle. That is courage under fire. When the Transition from Fourth World to Fifth World is well established, by the end of 2012, there will need to be a ceremony honoring these missionary-incarnation Star Kids. They came here knowing better, but yet they came. This spiritual service is “walking the talk.” A congressional Medal of Honor would not be good enough for these devoted Kids. Spirituality, it turns out, is not just a belief system. And it most certainly does not consist solely of pious intentions. True spirituality expresses itself most genuinely in action, in behavior which enshrines highest awareness, humility, and service to the greater good of the whole. Star Kids do not operate on Earth in a cultural vacuum. They are like other children: when they are small, they go where their parents take them. And until they get old enough to both be able and willing to think for themselves, they mouth and perhaps accept for a while the religious culture that the parents lay upon them. Depending on where the Star Child grows up, he or she may find themselves intellectually plunged into a milieu which takes the form of Christian, Buddhist, Islamic, animist, Jewish, Orthodox, Confucian, Hindu, or other religious culture. And yet, although these overly-formalistic traditions can prove a barrier to the proper understanding and practice of genuine spirituality, it is a delicious irony that these humandevised superstructures we call the world’s Great Religions are at root the distorted-over-time offshoots of very pure and simple spiritual understandings brought down from the sky by various Star Visitor teachers, the Avatars, over the millennia. Those Avatars (major world religious leaders) are understood to include, among others: Zoroaster (Zoroastrianism), Lao-Tse (Taoism), Moses (Judaism), Krishna (Hinduism), White Buffalo Calf Woman/Guadalupe (Native American spirituality), Quetzocoatl (Meso-American spirituality), Cochivamba (South American spirituality), Yeshua ben Joseph/Jesus (reformJudaism morphed into Christianity), Buddha (Buddhism), Quan Yin (compassionate Chinese Buddhist Enlightened One), Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani and other initiators of Sufism [universalist peaceful variant of Islam], and Bahá'u'lláh (Bahai). Native American shaman-experiencers such as Looks-For-Buffalo (Spiritual Elder Floyd Hand) have declared that Jesus was a Star-Man, and that the Avatars are Star People. The Star Visitors have indicated that the Avatars were sent to raise human spiritual consciousness, and have alluded to Star Visitor involvement with the avatars. Because of the imprecisions of oral history, it is difficult in some cases to determine whether a given Avatar was: 1) a human consistently guided by Star Visitor consciousnesses, 2) a human with ensoulment by a reincarnated soul who was a Star Visitor in a previous life and retained advanced consciousness in this life, 3) a human-extraterrestrial hybrid (Star Seed), or 4) a Star Visitor manifesting with a human appearance. None of the above scenarios negates the role of the divine in religious inspiration, but rather allows for the divine to partially manifest through various Star Visitor intermediaries. Just as the great religious books and doctrines were not uttered by God directly, but proclaimed to humanity and written down through human intermediaries (prophets, disciples, religious leaders, scribes, and monk-editors) as well. Let us follow the path of one such Avatar-Star Man in his efforts to bring a more uplifting and advanced spirituality to humans. This man is well known to many people: Yeshua Ben Joseph is his Aramaic name; he is more commonly known as Jesus of Nazareth.
74



His conception was attended by unusual circumstances, (although not all that unusual for many Star Kids and their startled mothers.) His conception was pre-announced to his mother-to-be, Miriam/Mary by an angel, Gabriel (Bible: Luke 1:26 -32). “Angel” is the English translation of the Greek biblical text word “angelos”, which means “messenger from the skies”. Nowhere in the Bible does it say that this messenger had wings. The wings of artists’ depictions signify that the messenger came down from the sky. Indeed he did, and from farther up than Earth’s atmosphere. The robe, beautiful human demeanor, and almostglow surrounding Gabriel are quite familiar to many experiencers and Star Seeds. There are hallmarks of a Star Visitor race who are frequent visitors to Earth. This race originates in the Pleiades star system. They look strikingly like handsome Nordic humans. Given a revised and corrected understanding of the Origin of Man, it would be more correct to say that we humans look an awful lot like the Pleiadeans. So, the Pleiadean angelos Gabriel appeared to Mary, and told her that she would conceive a son. Mary, a proper and virginal girl of about 14 years of age, remonstrated with the messenger, “How can this come about, since I am a virgin?” The messenger assured her that nevertheless she would have a son, and he would be destined to be great (Luke 35-36). No truer words have been spoken. (It is relevant here to note that a number of female experiencers of Star Visitor contact have also reported that they have conceived when it was not “possible”, due to factors such as not having a current sexual partner, being on a contraceptive, or being diagnosed with untreatable infertility. These experiencer women nevertheless subsequently went on to have a Star Kid.) The angelos Gabriel was nice enough to also visit Mary’s fiancé, Joseph, (who was probably about 16 or 17 years old), and inform him that Mary was pregnant, but that it was not due to human intercourse (Bible: Luke 18-21). Subsequently, Mary, by now quite pregnant, and her betrothed consort Joseph responded to a Roman occupation government decree. They traveled to Bethlehem, Joseph’s place of birth, to be entered on the government population census. Meanwhile, three Magi (court astronomer-astrologers in Persia, (what is now called Iran) saw an unusual light in the sky. It was not an ordinary star. This luminous object moved about and then hovered! So the Magi were intrigued and determined to follow this wandering “star” to see where it would lead (Matthew 2:1-2). Parallel experiences have been reported by modern experiencers, who have felt very strong impulses to follow Star Visitor craft, and subsequently had an encounter. It would not therefore be far-fetched to assume that the court astronomer-astrologers were motivated by a similar telepathically-sent impulse. Shortly after arriving in Bethlehem, Mary felt the signs of birth labor. Joseph made various efforts to find suitable lodging, but as a struggling, just-starting-out young couple with little funds, they had to settle for shelter in an animal manger. So, Jesus was born there. Soon thereafter, the three court astrologers showed up bearing gifts for the important personage they were informed would be born where the shining mobile “star” [spacecraft] stopped its wandering and hovered overhead (Matthew 2: 9-11). The Bible chronology then picks up when Jesus was age 12, beginning adolescence. In
75



the incident recorded, Jesus exhibited some of the behaviors of both a Star Kid and an adolescent. Most adolescents his age would go to temple and passively listen to the rabbis’ teachings. Not Jesus. This Passover, as his parents left Jerusalem after the religious observation, Jesus stayed behind without telling them so. He went back to the Temple, sat down among the learned rabbis, listened to them, and asked them questions. The rabbis were astounded at his intelligence and his answers to his questions after the rabbis had attempted to answer thhis questions (Luke 3:41-47). Sound like any Star Kids you know who amaze their teachers? When his parents discovered that Jesus was not in the caravan returning home from Jerusalem, they hurried back to Jerusalem and searched everywhere for their child. After three days of frantic searching, they found him in the Temple sitting among the senior rabbis. His parents were overcome with emotion when they spotted him. Mary said, “my child, why have you done this to us? See how worried your father and I have been looking for you!” Jesus’s reply was pure adolescent, and Star Kid: “Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must get busy doing my [heavenly] Father [Creator’s] work?” His parents did not understand (Luke 3: 48-50). But Jesus was not locked in adolescent rebellion, nor in continuing a premature exercise of his mission here on Earth. “He then went down with them and came to Nazareth and lived under their authority.” (Luke 3:51) But he was not idle. This premier Star Kid studied and increased his wisdom; he grew taller; he became well-liked in his community; and he acted in a fashion that was in accord with Creator’s way (Luke 3:52). Jesus bided his time during the rest of his teen and early adulthood years, pursuing the carpenter’s trade until he reached the age of 30, at which age people would be more inclined to take him seriously as a teacher of spiritual matters. He then began a new career, his Earth mission, teaching people about the true nature of God, about real spirituality, and of the real place people have in an intelligent, compassionate and spiritual world. He was also a strong voice of witness against the corrupt institutions of his day. In Israel the most prominent such corrupt institution was the semitheocracy of the Jewish priests. Israel was so solidly a religious state that even the Roman occupation government knew enough to leave in place the religious hierarchy as a kind of second-tier political power. The Temple priests had turned religion into a money-making enterprise, (hardly the first such aberration in history.) Jesus not only taught a basic set of compelling spiritual and moral principles, but he railed publicly against the corrupt institutions which sought to interpose themselves between the common people and God. Like other Avatars (teachers whose ideas were turned into the great world religions), Jesus was sent to try to bring the confused and misled common people back to a simple core of spiritual understandings and moral behavior. In so doing, he also challenged the Judaic practice of the time, and was seen as a reformer of Judaism by his followers, but a dangerous heretic if not infidel by the Jewish religious authorities of the time. Like other reformers going up against corrupt human institutions, this Pleiadean Star Man paid the price. Scorned by political leaders, reviled by the theocracy who trumped up
76



charges against him and turned him over to the occupying government as a “threat to national security”, Jesus experienced what would look like to some people to be mission failure. He was falsely indicted, “convicted”, abused while in custody, and summarily executed. Yet it is the power of the nature of the goodness and truth he taught that the teachings he brought not only survived his death, but spread across the world and still powerfully influence millions of people today. The presence, personality and character of Jesus drew people to him in a way somewhat reminiscent of the attractive pull many people feel towards Star Kids and Star Seeds. And Star Man Yeshua used various of his advanced powers to help people, and also to provide corroborative support for the truth and goodness of his teachings. His psychic diagnosis and psychic healing of the naked, howling, self-mutilating psychotic from the region of the Gerasenes astounded and impressed people (Luke 8: 26-39). His using psychic energy to calm a storm in the Dead Sea that almost swamped the boat he was in amazed his disciples (Luke 8: 22-25). His transmuting jugs of water into wine at a wedding reception in Cana caused people to marvel (John 2; 1-11). And his use of psychic power to bring back to life a recently-deceased man, Lazarus made people wonder if there was any limit to what he could do (John 11:1-44). Yet, psychic modification of weather, psychic diagnosis and healing, transmuting of material objects, and bringing dying or dead plants, animals and persons back to life are things which Star Kids (and Star Seed adults) also do. Jesus’s preeminent role as a worker of what seem like “miracles” is not diminished by the reality that those whose development has reached an advanced level can also facilitate many of these works of wonder. Yeshua himself noted that anyone who believes will be able to do the same works of wonder as he did, nay, ven greater works (John 14: 12). Jesus’s own resurrection from the dead and reappearing among his astounded followers was facilitated by the restoration work his fellow Pleiadeans did on him. They did not abandon their own in his sojourn upon Earth. One of these luminous Pleiadean angeloi stood by Jesus’s empty tomb, and told those who had come to mourn that he was no longer dead. And Yeshua’s departure from among his followers and ascension towards the heavens provided an important final lesson on the persistence of the person after death, and the reality of reincarnation. And when the figure known as Jesus returns, with his Star Visitor colleagues in the near future, many will be surprised, not that he returned, but to discover how badly their churches have distorted over time his actual nature and teachings. I have gone on at length to examine the life of Jesus from a Star Visitor and Star Seed perspective because Christianity is a globally widespread religion. And because existing misunderstandings and distortions about Jesus have conveyed the impression that he is God, or that his relationship to Supreme Source is unique in the universe. While Jesus’s relationship with God and spiritual development were more advanced than anyone else’s on Earth at that time, the relationship and development are not necessarily more advanced than any other conscious intelligent being in the universe, nor than those of some of the Avatars who followed him. But it must certainly be noted that Sidartha Gautama (Buddha) and Lao Tse (organizer
77



of Taoist spiritual philosophy) and Krishna (great teacher of Hinduism) were also highly spiritually advanced Star Men (to use the phrase of a leading Lakota (Sioux) spiritual Elder, Looks-For-Buffalo (Floyd Hand). These Avatars’ teachings have lifted up the spiritual minds and moral behavior of millions across the globe. Star Kids differ in the kind of spirituality they acknowledge and practice. For example, a number of Star Kid teens I know in the United Kingdom are drawn to Wicca, a prehistorical, indigenous nature spirituality that predated the arrival of Christianity and other World Religions from overseas. Many Star Kids in North, Central and South America find indigenous (Native American) spirituality appealing, with its finding of sacredness everywhere in nature, its sensitivity to Spirit’s presence in nature’s cycles, and its basic attitude of gratefulness for Spirit’s largesse. And of course, Native American spirituality honors the tunkasilas, the spirit teachers from the stars who taught the native peoples so much. Some Star Kids in Asian countries resonate with the basic living principles of core Buddhist teaching, and leave aside the human accretions of dogma and elaborate ritual. Likewise, some thoughtful Star Kids in China find the spiritually balanced philosophical teachings of Taoism appealing, while eschewing the temple ceremonies. But very many Star Kids have a spiritual struggle in trying to find a spirituality that fits for them, that does not feel artificial or fake, or merely an extension of childhood behavior shaped by their parents. And yet a large percentage of the newer Star Kids come in with an appropriate natureand-cosmos spirituality already “installed” in their consciousness. What does this cosmic spirituality mean? It means several things. This Star Kid spirituality intuitively senses the presence of Spirit/Life Force/Supreme Source everywhere. And when the Star Kid travels out among the stars, whether transported on a starcraft by Star Visitors, or traveling on her own in an out-of-body-state travel, she senses Spirit is there, too. Star Kid cosmic spirituality recognizes the sacredness of the Star Kid’s own consciousness, and its clear linkage to the Supreme Consciousness which pervades and holds-in-definition the whole universe. This spirituality means that a Star Kid sees the underlying life-consciousness in other people, (whether on Earth or from the stars), in other living creatures, and in the Earth; and honors it as sacred. Because of these spiritual understandings, Star Kids recognize the validity of the moral principle of treating others accordingly. Many Star Kids are reluctant to deliberately step on an ant. Their strong adherence to respect for ecological systems means they would shudder at witnessing any deliberate pollution. More than one parent of a Star Kid has had a lecture from their small child about some thoughtless behavior that caused pollution. And because of their cosmic spirituality, many Star Kids do not fear death. Because of their understanding of reincarnation, and the successive opportunities to engage life and make things better over lifetimes, these small ones at times get almost philosophical about, for example, whether they survive a severe accident or illness that has hospitalized them. “Don’[t worry, Mom, I love you. If I die, I’ll come back and be near you.” Star Kids are not perfect, and are not born fully developed. They benefit from correct instruction, and they can temporarily be detoured by faulty teachings. Yet, within each Star
78



Kid is an inner basic illumination and a basic moral sense that creates a tendency towards realizing their highest and best potential as a spiritual being, a living image of the Transcendent.

Chapter 6
How Did the Star Kids Get Here? A Short and Revised History of the Human Race
The Star Nations Revision To Darwinian Explanation of Human Development
Over eons, a number of Star Visitor races evolved to intelligent life forms on their respective planets across the universe. Some of these civilizations are millions of years old. Other intelligent races "out there" developed not from evolution, but from "missionary" sowing of intelligent life on planets whose indigenous biota had evolved to the point where one or more animal species could provide a suitable anatomy and physique for Star Visitors from elsewhere to bio-engineer in high intelligence and spirituality. Whether evolved or bio-engineered, many Star Nations operate like Peace Corps workers, going about the galaxy, exploring, and trying to do good wherever they can. One or more of these groups decided to accelerate evolution on Earth. They selected a promising primate phylum to take reproductive material samples from, crossed it with some of their own DNA, and reinserted it in the primate mother, so that the resulting offspring would be intelligent. After several iterations of effort, the Visitors around 275,000 years ago achieved a hybrid with a portion of their very high intelligence, a smattering of their highly-developed psychic abilities and spirituality, and sufficient dexterity and coordination to be capable of fashioning tools and intricate designs. In other words, they had achieved Homo Sapiens. After observing Homo Sapiens in operation over a number of generations, and its idiosyncratic blend of primate animal instinctuality with incipient intelligent spiritual sensitivity, the Star Visitors were dissatisfied with the intelligence level of their hybrid. They then decided to proceed further with an additional genetic engineering upgrade. The result was what Earth anthropologists label Homo Sapiens Sapiens, modern humankind. This penultimate bit of bioengineering occurred approximately 130,000 years ago. Subsequent intervention by the observer Star Visitors took the form of cultural and spiritual teaching and tutoring, at times causing Avatars to emerge in various strategic zones around the Earth. These Avatars have become known and revered as the Great Teachers, some of whose wisdom had later become enshrined as one of the several World Religions. Because of the imprecisions of oral history, it is difficult in some cases to determine whether a given Avatar was a human consistently guided by Star Visitor consciousness, was a human with ensoulment by a soul which was a Star Visitor in a previous life and retained advanced consciousness in this subsequent human life, was a human-extraterrestrial hybrid, or was a Star Visitor manifesting a human appearance while operating among humans on Earth. Some of these Avatars clearly were Star Visitors, appearing “magically”, and displaying preternatural powers, such as White Buffalo Calf Woman/ Lady of Guadalupe (for North America), Quetzalcoatl (for Meso-America), and Viracocha (in South America), or featuring exotic skin colors, such as bluish-skinned Krishna (Hinduism). Other Avatars were evidently Star Visitor-human hybrids, highly endowed with genius, advanced spirituality, and psychic powers: Quan Yin (compassionate Enlightened One revered in
80



Chinese Buddhism), and Yeshua ben Joseph/Jesus (teacher of reformed Judaism, later morphed into Christianity). Still others operated either with Star Visitor consciousness guidance or overshadowing, or were reincarnated Star Visitors retaining the advanced consciousness from their previous incarnation. These would include: Zarathustra (Zoroastrianism Middle East metaphysical spirituality), Lao-Tse ( Taoism), Moses (Judaism), Buddha (Buddhism), Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani and other initiators of Sufism [universalist peaceful variant of Islam], and Bahá'u'lláh (Bahai). These cultural and spiritual interventions were done in an effort to lead humankind away from the excesses of animal instinctuality, such as territoriality, aggressiveness, and predation on the weak; and to point humankind towards its highest and best metaphysical and spiritual potential as a hybrid intelligent species. These observer Star Visitor efforts went on until approximately 150 years ago. At about that time, after witnessing the horrors of the wars of the Nineteen Century, the Star Visitors decided that humankind was far too capable of ignoring the teachings of the Avatars, and that the human "recipe" itself needed direct upgrading via further bioengineering. They also foresaw that humanity was getting closer to the time when it would venture out into space, and wanted humans to be fit fellow citizens of the cosmos. The observant Star Visitors thereupon embarked on a program to re-refine Homo Sapiens into something more advanced. They began to select certain humans to splice in a greater percentage of Star Visitor genetic material, in order to amplify intelligence, sensitivity, psychic abilities, metaphysical "hunger", and greater attunement to the intrinsic spirituality permeating reality. The Visitors began in-vitro fertilization of the mothers of the first Star Kids, and also physiologically “rewiring" selected already-born humans into Star Seed hybrid humans. The result was what the Chief Counsel for the Smithsonian Institute in1995 labeled "Homo Alterios Spatialis", or Cosmic Human. Many of the Visitors also volunteered to incarnate as an Earth human this time around. At first, there were only a scattered few of the advanced-model humans. Nicolai Tesla (1856-1943) was clearly one of the first new upgrades. Albert Einstein was another. Jane Addams (1860-1935), Nobel Prize-winning crusader for peace, democracy and women's rights, and Mahatma Gandhi, revered peaceful crusader for justice for the oppressed, were a third and a fourth. Albert Schweitzer (1875-1965), compassionate missionary physician, ethicist, and peace advocate was yet another. Mother Teresa (1910-1997) and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (19291968) and scores more followed their footsteps decades later. More Star Kids were born in the 1930s and 1940s who would come of age as a new Space Age dawned. (The Space Age is dated from the first satellite launch [1957: Sputnik], followed by creation of NASA, and President Kennedy’s 1961 Space Program to put a man on the Moon.) Then, around the end of the 1980s, there began a quantum leap in the number of Star Kids being born. The Star Visitors knew that there was no more time to waste in moving humanity out of its awkward "adolescence phase” as a species, before it blew itself up or terminally poisoned its environment. They began dramatically stepping up the number of encounters with humans, including reproductive re-engineering, combined with a metaphysical program of massive reincarnation of star beings as humans, to increase the numbers of children subsequently born who were Star Kids. The Baby Boom of the Cosmic Generation had begun. In poured millions of these advanced children in a veritable Star Kids Tidal Wave. This in-pouring escalates and continues to this day. My research, outlined in Chapter One, indicates that now the vast majority of small children are Star Kids. At this rate the human race will be overwhelmingly made up of people
81



with partial Star Seed heritage by the year 2012, the date indigenous tradition identified as the year when Fifth World (cosmic society) will be well in place.
Why Are The Star Kids Here Now?
This is a fair question, and certainly an important one. Let’s divide this question into its three parts: “Why”, “Here”, and “Now”, and address each one. One big part of “why” the Star Kids needed to come in is the matter of human shortcomings. More specifically, the failings of Homo Sapiens Sapiens, current ordinary human. Without reaching too far back into history, one issue clearly stands out. Human wars have been getting larger and nastier. Earlier in history, wars were fought between regional kingdoms, duchies or tribes for the most part. Even for those few megalomaniacs who sought to “conquer the world,” such as Alexander the Great, certain Roman Emperors, or Genghis Khan, it turns out that their wars resulted in a conquered “world” which was actually a quite defined area, rather territorially modest on a global scale. Alexander the Great briefly conquered Greece, Turkey, Egypt, the Middle East, and what is modern Iraq and Iran. The Roman Empire at its greatest extent embraced all the countries facing the Mediterranean, the Middle East, a swath of north-central Europe and the British Isles. Genghis Khan and his successors briefly held territory from China to eastern Russia. But in 1914 humans engaged in a First World War, bringing into conflict countries from Russia throughout Europe to North America. And then in 1939 World War II erupted, which involved virtually every continent on Earth and the majority of countries on Earth. World War II ended in the blinding flash of unbearable light and searing hellish heat of atomic fireballs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The world sank into a shaky peace, but research and development of even more horrible and larger-scale weapons continued. Human “ingenuity” has proceeded to fashion other weapons of mass destruction. The Western Powers have fashioned monstrosities which include: 1) engineered, man-made, virulent super-viruses, for which there is no natural immunity, and no vaccine outside the classified world; 2) chemical agents such as Sarin nerve gas, which kills almost instantaneously, and plutonium dust, of which it takes just one speck inhaled to kill a person by a very-rapidly growing cancer, and which can be spread over a city by a conventional explosive in a tall building; 3) scalar weapons, which can deliver a super-large electromagnetic force to a far-distant targeted population, destroy its machinery, and render the people in the target zone dazed and confused, or cooked; 4) killer laser rays and neutral particle (destroyer) beams from orbiting platforms can annihilate targets anywhere on Earth; and, 5) directed, modulated radio-frequency and microwave energy beams, which can penetrate a target population’s heads, implant controlling thoughts and messages, and cause selected emotions to occur upon command. If World War III were to break out, it would create a new, more terrible, and even more global arena of carnage and destruction. It is clear that World War III must not happen. But it is far from clear that World War II will not happen. The Star Kids are constitutionally aversive to violence. Some of the early Star Kids, who are now grown up and middle-aged or are seniors are working for peace as moral leaders, as anti-war campaigners, and as advocates of deep solutions to conflicts, real solutions like economic justice on a global scale, self-determination of definable groups of peoples seeking autonomy, and global conflict-resolution organizations. Other Star Kids are taking a stand by resisting joining the military, or. if “awakened” to the wrongness of war while already inside the ranks of the military, these Star Kids will express
82



their moral convictions by conscientious objection and refusal to fight. As more and more Star Kids come of age, and as more and more Star Kids awaken to their true identity, purpose, and mission on Earth, the generals and schemers of this world will increasingly find that the majority of this new generation, unlike their brothers and sisters during the Viet Nam War era, will not be chanting, “Hell, no; we won’t go!” The new Star Kids will skip the profanity and simply not show up. Furthermore, more and more of these Star Kids will openly question and criticize and resist the insanity of dying for oil, of fighting for territorial expansion of markets by the major power states, and of combat to subjugate “swarthy” populations to meet the intrinsically racist agenda of the geoplutocratic “elite” who currently set the geopolitical agenda. The above historical review strongly suggests a widespread human failing in the current Homo Sapiens Sapiens “recipe”. Put parsimoniously, there is still too much primate residue in ordinary humans, and not enough of the Star Visitor genetics which underpin advanced philosophical, spiritual and moral behavior. And as if the above were not enough reason and motivation to send in the Star Kids now, there are other areas of human failing as well. Materialism is not just a matter of over-enthusiastic consumer spending. Materialism is a corrosion of the soul. It creeps into the zone of being excess, when the realm of spirit is neglected or practically dead. Materialism is a desperate attempt by people to fill the void of their personal meaning. When people no longer think that their value comes from being part of the cosmic fabric permeated by Supreme Source [God], when people no longer believe that their dignity and honor come from being higher-evolved conscious aspects of the Supreme Consciousness which pervades all reality, when people look around them and believe that the only things that exist are solid objects, then the compulsion sets in to try to create a sense of personal worth, and a sense of dignity and distinguishedness, by accumulating numerically more and more expensive objects, so as to gain a sense of value, dignity and honor by having more and finer material possessions than the other people around. Awakened Star Kids do not find their sense of value, dignity and worth from material possessions. Star Kids come in with sensitive philosophical values, and are not inclined to fall into the materialism trap. As a collective society, Star Kids will not build a culture which exalts materialism. Hyper-individualism is another human failing which contributes to the violence and coldness of contemporary ordinary-human society. By way of contrast, all the Star Visitor cultures have a healthy sense of community, and of communitarian values. The Star Nations cultures do not have as heroes the solitary gunslinger, be he western cowboy a la John Wayne or Clint Eastwood, or be he a cosmic cowboy a la Arnold “Terminator” Schwarzenegger. The Star Visitor cultures value a healthy sense of social responsibility: that an individual does not have a proper existence in isolation from her community, that an individual’s purpose is to make a solid contribution to her society as well as operate within the context of her own individual blend of talents, capabilities, competencies and interests, that an individual is no greater than the community which gave her “birth”, that she participates in, and owes her heritage to. The hyper-individualism which infects so many Earth cultures, (a few small indigenous communities being the exceptions), tears at the fabric of the Social Contract which implicitly binds all in a society. Hyper-individualism leads to societies in which “Me first!” is the operating principle; other people are seen as a nuisance and a bother, or someone to exploit, or to feel superior to, and there is little concern for the poor, the disabled, and the other unfortunates who “cannot make their own way.” Star Kids have a built-in gravitation towards one another. There is an intrinsic attraction that Star Kids (and adult Star Seeds) feel for each other. While some Star Kids have an Introvert personality, while others are Extroverts, no Star Kid would consider a fellow human being expendable, useless, a sucker to be preyed upon, or deserving to be manipulated. The Fifth
83



World cosmic society which Star Kids (and their Star Seed elders) are gradually constructing around the as-yet-unrecognized ruins of current Fourth World society will have strong communitarian values. The telepathic and intuitive shared mind-field and emotion-field which Star Kids operate in has no place for the sad, isolated absurdity of hyper-individualism. Egotism is yet another prevalent human failing. Egotism both feeds, and is fed by, hyperindividualism, and shares its failings. Further, egotism is based on a false and exaggerated sense of self-importance. Such an aberration leads to the materialism and hyper-individualism mentioned earlier. Excessive egotism is behind the grasping for power and status, as tools to lord it over other people and exert control on them. Such egotism is again a cancer of the human spirit. It derives from a desperate attempt to compensate for gnawing feelings of inadequacy. A healthy communitarian society supports the worth and contribution of each individual member. And thus, in such a society there is no need to feel inadequate nor to try to compensate by exaggerated egotism. Star Kids are not egotistical despite their often dazzling array of advanced abilities. The Star Kids understand that these advanced abilities are gifts and tools: there to help the Star Kid make better connection to other people, and to the environment. These gifts exist to serve and inform the community. These powers are tools with which to do good and to avoid or prevent harm. In the Fifth World society, these gifts are widely distributed. Some Star Kids have more of one, others of another. There is no need for jealousy or power-tripping. It is understood that when every Star Kid (and adult Star Seed) is making their contribution to society, everyone benefits, and everything gets taken care of. Another reason the Star Kids are here now in such profusion is because the Star Visitors who are watching over us care. Their motto might well be an adaptation of that old United Negro College Fund advertising slogan, “A mind is a terrible thing to waste.” As far as the Star Visitors are concerned, “A planet is a terrible thing to waste.” The Star Visitors have to walk a very delicate tightrope. They do not, and morally cannot, come in and culturally take over Earth society and “make it fly right.” But neither do they feel that they can just sit idly by and spectate while humans down below poison and blow themselves up and incinerate and kill life off on the planet. So, they have taken the path of soft intervention. They have made millions of trips to individuals with messages of warning and advisement. And they are sending in the Star Kids by the millions to leaven the dough of society and make it rise. The Star Visitors know that the Star Kids will not be ejected by society, because, after all, these are our own children. And recognizably so. And they are so precious, so cute and so amazing! Finally, let’s examine the “Now” in Why Are the Star Kids Here Now? Why did the Star Kid Baby Boom really start to build in the latter 1980s and following years? Well, let’s look at some of the alternatives. What if the Star Kid Baby Boom had happened during the Dark Ages? They certainly needed light and help back then. Or during the United States’ Civil War? Heavens knows they could have used some enlightenment and infusion of compassion. Or during the early 1960s? If the Star Kids Baby Boom had happened during the Dark Ages, what reception would these child prodigies have received? We really don’t have to guess. Ordinary humans who displayed just one psychic gift were deemed strange and fearsome. A person who could see into the future, or heal by application of psychic energy alone, was called “possessed by the devil” or “a witch”. If the Star Kids had come in then to deal with the ignorance, fear, and petty warfare, the populace would have noticed their double-handfuls of paranormal abilities and branded them as “super-witches” or “the Devil himself”. And those Star Kids would have suffered a
84



predictable fate of hanging, drawing-and-quartering, the rack, or being burned at the stake. If the Star Kid Baby Boom had happened during the U.S. Civil War, some of the Star Kids would have been born into Union families and some into Confederate families. Some would have been born white and some would have been born Black. Star Kids in Union States would have been conscripted to fight, and if they declined such a killing role, they would have been reviled as “disloyal”, branded as suspected “Rebel sympathizers”, jailed, ostracized, dispossessed of their property, or worse. Those of age in Confederate States who refused to join the Army and fight would have faced a similar fate. Those Star Kids born as African slaves, if they displayed their powers of learning and psychic abilities would be persecuted as “uppity” or as “devil-worshippers”, flogged, put in chains, or worse. What if the Star Kid Baby Boom had occurred during the 1960s? Actually, personally, I hypothesize that there was a small “trial-run” Star Kid Baby Boomlet that came of age during the 1960s. The “Love Power”, Anti-War, Civil Rights, anti-materialism, pro-environment, shared communal lifestyles practiced by many of those Hippies and social protesters are strikingly like the values and themes that resonate with today’s Star Kids. But this “first-run” Boomlet of earlier-model Star Kids got quickly co-opted by the startled, threatened and crafty leaders of that day. Heavy drugs were poured into those social-protest communities. The lofty ideals of the Hippie Culture were quickly commercialized and neutralized by the twisting of Love into irresponsible promiscuity, the branding of war protesters as “cowards” and “traitors”, the vilification of Civil Rights protesters as “Communist agitators”, the perversion of antimaterialism into slogan-button and bumper-strip sales and fashion wear, the pro-environmental activism became ridiculed as “tree-huggers” or “damagers of the economy”, the shared communal living experiments were twisted into “socialized orgies”. The Establishment could not allow this social revolution to get traction. And yet this Baby Boomlet of Star Kid social revolutionary leaders did create an enormous beachhead in the public consciousness. Though the Hippie Movement was crushed, enduring threads of influence continue into contemporary society. Enormous gains in racialminority civil rights have resulted from the momentum generated by the activism of that time. Questioning of war as to whether it is just and an actual patriotic duty continued from Viet Nam to both Gulf Wars and the Iraq Incursion. Environmental sensitivity in deciding public policy issues like allowable growth and preserving coastlines and wetlands continues. The earlier Star Kid Baby Boomlet crashed and splintered against the highly-resistant wall of ultra-conservative thinking, entrenched financial and political power, and threatened organized religion. Yet like the heroic World War II infantryman who threw his body over the enemy’s concertina barbed-wire barrier, so that his fellow platoon mates could race over his body and thus the barrier and quickly take the enemy machine-gun emplacements, so too, this earlier Star Kid Baby Boomlet created a breach in the fortifications of the existing Fourth World culture, and broadened a path for today’s Star Kid Baby Boom to march on in. The Star Kids are here now because here is no time to waste. Because planet Earth is a terrible thing to waste. Because we need a radical change of direction in the way we conduct our society. And because we are overdue in readying ourselves to properly respond to the invitation from the Star Nations to come on out and join the larger family of truly civilized worlds. The challenge for the rest of humankind is to get with the program. Having this wonderful Baby Boom of such amazing kids among us is just too immensely important an event to ignore, to trivialize, or to misunderstand. I call upon every reader who believes that he or she is a regular human being to pledge to themself that they will join this quiet revolution, too. It is not us-or-them. The human race is a “we”. And I assure every ordinary-human reader that the Star Kids (and adult Star Seeds)
85



welcome everyone of good will into the crusade to remake this society along the better principles outlined above. Together we can refashion the Earth, save our planet, and create a blessed and secure home for our children, our grandchildren, and many generations to come.

Chapter 7
The Various Kinds Of Star Visitors In Contact With Earth
To begin a discussion of the various kinds of Star Visitors in contact with Earth we immediately notice that the various Visitors seem to belong to various races, because of various similarities of appearance that suggest that varying numbers of Star Visitors share common origins or ancestries. Even within the numbers of Star Visitors who look fairly similar in appearance, but have some distinguishing differences in clothing (or non-use thereof), type of craft, personality and behavioral styles, we are inclined to ascribe these similar-looking Star Visitors to different cultures, or planet-of-origin within a racial group.
The term “race” is used to distinguish various Star Visitors of decidedly different appearances. More research into exo-biology, (the science which includes Star Visitor life's physical structure and processes), will help us understand better how many races of intelligent species we are dealing with. So would the declassifying of the Government's already considerable covert research on Star Visitor exo-biology, (such as is going on at NASA's Ames Research Center, Sunnyvale, CA, and at Los Alamos National Laboratories, NM.)
For convenience the term "race" will be used here to distinguish Star Visitors of significantly different anatomical features.
The most common Star Visitor race encountered has within itself a number of variants. This race is popularly, and rather imprecisely, called the "Greys". The most common variant has identified themselves as having origin in the Zeta Reticuli star system. Thus, they are also dubbed the Zetas. Yet there are striking variations in size and details of appearance among these “Greys”. Such differences may represent origins on different planets. The "Greys" are stereotyped (by uninformed or careless writers) as: short, upright, two-legged beings, three-anda-half feet tall, with grayish-white skin, large, hairless, fetal-shaped heads, with huge, all-black, sloping, almond-shaped eyes without pupils or eyelids, whose eyes wrap around partially towards the temple-area sides of the head, a narrow jaw tapering to almost a V, small nostril holes but no nose, a small, thin, lip-less, horizontal slit for a mouth, thin torsos with no visible ribs and no genitals evident, long, spindly, but surprisingly strong arms reaching to the knees, similarly long, very thin legs, and hands with three long, non-tapering, joint-less fingers, which end in claws instead of fingernails, but no thumb.
To be sure, there is such a race of beings. Or at least a race, of which this is one of the variants. However, there are also: five-foot tall "Greys", seven-foot tall "Greys", "Greys" with mushroom-white skin, "Greys" with brown skin, "Greys" with black skin, "Greys" whose large eyes have a thin nictating membrane which can extend across the eye, "Greys" with midnight
87



blue eyes, "Greys" with wispy fine small amounts of hair on their heads, "Greys" with four fingers, and "Greys" with three or four fingers plus another finger positioned where the human thumb would be, and "Greys" whose fingers end with suction-cup-like tips.
There have also been Star Visitors reported who have a large process of folds along the back of their heads, a series of deep creases or crevices along the top of the head, sloping down forward towards the front, and with a strongly-pronounced brow- ridge above the eyes.
Are these twelve or more different races? Or variants based on evolving in different climactic zones on one planet? Does this represent racial variation within inhabited planets in one star system? Or are these variations which occur within one cluster of star systems? Or does the "Grey" genotype tend to appear in many different star systems, on some planets, along with other races, on other planets, within those same star systems? The truth is, we do not know. Or at least that information has not been released by the government to the public. Thus, we civilians are still at the stage of gathering information on the various different types of intelligent lifeforms visiting our planet.
Another source of variation even within what is apparently one race is clothing. Many experiencers report that their "Zeta" visitors wore no clothes. Others have seen "Zetas" wearing long robes and hoods over their heads. Others have seen crews where both versions of attire, as well as close-fitting jumpsuits, were in evidence. Yet Zetas are not the only ones wearing robes.
Another race of Star Visitors is the 4-to-5-1/2-foot-tall Being, with a somewhat large head (by comparison with the human head), but not as proportionally large as the "Zetas", and who has somewhat large (but smaller than the "Zetas") dark oval eyes, spindly frame and limbs, and a hand with three long, cartilaginous, bone-less fingers, which end with neither claw nor suction-cup, but rather "ordinary" fingertip shape, except that their fingers do not taper.
A more distinctive kind of Star Visitor is the "Praying Mantis type" race. These Beings have long, narrow faces, with long, narrow, large eyes, sharply slanted upward and outward in an almost narrow-V position, given an almost insect-like appearance. This comparison is heightened by the Praying-Mantis types' extremely thin, long torsos, long, extremely-thin arms, which are usually crooked into a sharp bend at the mid-joint, with the hand-and-fingers “mitten” sloping almost vertically downward from the "wrist". Their legs are also bent at an almost rightangle at the mid-joint, creating a crouched pose. The overall effect is the characteristic "Praying Mantis" look. It should be noted that experiencers feel that this type is no insect, but rather an intelligent, ethereal, gentle-spirited, highly metaphysically and spiritually-developed, but somewhat "hyper" and jerky-moving, human-like lifeform. There are both males and females.
Another race is the so-called "Reptilians", or "Reptoids", although I note again that there is no implication in these descriptors of anything other than of intelligent, communicative persons. What distinguishes these "Reptilian" Star Visitors is their skin, which has small, fine scales, sort of like on the belly of a chameleon, rather than being smooth. Their face has largerthan-human yellowish-green eyes with a "starburst" or slit-shaped pupil, the eyes often oval, and an almost snout-like blunt process in the area of the nose and mouth, giving this type an almost dragon-like humanoid appearance.
Another group of Star Visitors for convenience, I call the "Jawas", after their resemblance to the creatures in the film, Star Wars. This group is distinguished by their clothing. They wear hoods and robes, are generally short (three to four-and-a-half feet tall), and their faces are concealed by the shadows thrown by their hoods. Sometimes there is a much taller hooded and
88



robed one on board the UFO, who often stands to the Experiencer's left as s/he lies on the Visitor medical examining table. This Tall One appears to direct the procedures, and often is the one who telepathically communicates with the Experiencer. A few Experiencers have noted glowing eyes under the "Jawas'" hoods. Other Experiencers have reported that when they got a glimpse of the Being whose face was shadowed by the hood, it was a type of "Grey". Still others saw neither glowing eyes nor "Greys" under the hoods, but rather never could distinguish the features in the shadows of the hoods.
There are often mixed-race crews on the UFO's. In such cases there could be "Jawas" or "Praying Mantis" types or "Reptoids" or "Greys", joining in a coordinated effort in carrying out scientific or medical tasks.
A few Experiencers have noted robot-like figures, whose movements and "vibes" (or rather lack thereof) strongly suggest that these are robots sent remotely by the Star Visitors to observe, reconnoiter, and possibly retrieve objects. However, I have not encountered any reports of robots actually interfacing with humans to accomplish communication, or to remove the human to their craft for scientific examination. The robot-like figures appear to be relegated to the more impersonal tasks of information-gathering and stealthy surveillance, without the risk to the Star Visitors that they would otherwise run of possibly encountering hostile human responses.
My research has also come up with a great number of reports of "Humanoid", "Blonde", or "Nordic" Star Visitors almost indistinguishable from humans. Indeed, Native American and other indigenous people's traditions point to their origin from the worlds of these human-looking Visitors in the Pleiades, Sirius, Orion and other star systems. If you were to place a pair of sunglasses on one of these "Nordic" Visitors, they would be indistinguishable from a Scandinavian-American citizen.
A former USAF Airman assigned to Nevada’s Nellis Air Force Range, Charles J. Hall made mention that he knew of another humanoid Star Visitor race that he dubbed the "Norwegians" (actually, Laplanders or Sammi people). His dentist in Madison, Wisconsin alerted him to anomalous features of these people. These Sammi people live above the Arctic Circle in Norway, Finland, Sweden and a northwestern peninsula of Russia. They have their own distinctive language, and traditionally survived by herding reindeer. They predominantly have only 24 teeth instead of the usual 32 found in "regular" humans. Further the Sammi have another set of reserve teeth below the gum-line ready to grow into place if an adult tooth falls out. Their teeth also have much shorter roots than the "regular" human tooth. Hall heard of some of these "Norwegian" Sammi who emigrated to the United States immigrants, and generally settled in northern-tier states like Wisconsin. Former USAF Airman Charles Hall described yet another race whom he dubbed the Tall Whites. This race originates from a location near the star Arcturus. These Tall Whites are in adulthood around six feet in height and have generally humanoid features. They have blond hair, generally worn short, and the women tend to wear their hair in a feminine form of short cut. They are blue-eyed, and have larger-than-human eyes which wrap part-way around the side of their head. The Tall Whites otherwise look quite human, except that their skin is a chalky-white in color. They have hands with four fingers, which often appear not end in finger nails but rather in harder, two-inch-long claw-like appendages. Mr. Hall has seen some Tall Whites occasionally without these claw-like nails, and believes that the “claws” are a kind of glue-on super-nails that the Tall Whites use for personal defense against predators in the desert where they live. The
89



typical clothing of the Tall Whites is an aluminized, chalk-white jump suit of canvas-looking fabric. They also wear gloves of the same material, and an open, white, motorcycle-like helmet. Both the suit and the helmet emit a three-inch-out field of soft-white fluorescent light. The intensity of this emitted light can be varied from soft to too bright to look at without strain. These Tall Whites have very high intelligence and a neurological information-processing speed which Mr. Hall estimates at 3-1/2 times faster than bright humans. The Tall Whites's technology is advanced. One element of their technology is a transporter suit which they put on which provides personal antigravity levitation and above-ground movement, as well as force-field protection against attacks, e.g., would slow a bullet to where it would fall to the ground. Dr. Michael Wolf, late of the National Security Council, has described several additional extraterrestrial races, ones he has dubbed the Oranges, and another, the Semitics.. "One race has orange skin, very large heads and large dark eyes with no irises or whites, and six-fingered hands. During dissection their brains have been found to have four brain lobes, different optic orbs and nerves, and a sponge-like digestive system. ET brains are more developed and connected, and have no corpus callosum." Dr. Wolf also described a race dubbed the Semitics, of average height and a generally human-like appearance, except for their very large hooked nose, larger than that of the Earth Jewish (Semitic) people. "This was the race which landed at Holloman Air Force Base [Alamogordo, New Mexico, April 25, 1964], and conversed with some generals there." In corroboration of this incident, a report by two film producers provides additional details. “In 1972-73 Colonel William Coleman, former USAF Project Blue Book spokesman, and former ATIC Commander Colonel George Weinbrenner, made an offer of ‘800 feet of film . . .as well as several thousand feet of additional material’ of dramatic UFO material to documentary film producers Robert Emenegger and Allan Sandler at the Pentagon. They would be allowed to use the UFO footage in a special film project they had been asked to join.” “Paul Shartle, who had controlled the film at Norton Air Force Base, described what he saw on the film as,
"I saw footage of three disc-shaped crafts. One of the craft landed and two of them went away . . . It appeared to be in trouble because it oscillated all the way down to the ground. However, it did land on three pods. A sliding door opened, a ramp was extended, and out came three aliens . . . They were human size. They had odd gray complexions and a pronounced nose. They worn tight-fitting jump suits, thin headdresses that appeared to be communications devices, and in their hands they held a translator, I was told. The Holloman base commander and other Air Force officers went out to meet them . . .." [http://www.presidentialufo.com/disclosure_7275.htm] (Needless to say, the promised film was never given to the producers by the Air Force, and the spectacular documentary was never made.) Dr. Wolf also provided an answer to the question many people have about why they never see certain Star Visitor races eat, and why there don’t usually seem to be any bathrooms aboard Star Visitor craft. Wolf noted that some of the Star Visitors eat vegetation and mushrooms, while others have different requirements. The latter races absorb energy from the air and [certain] particulates. The Visitors don't absorb enough water to need to void; because they process what they intake thoroughly. One group of Zetas absorb nutrients through their skin via a thin paste spread on a portion of their skin. Another Star Visitor racial type described are the short, chubby, homely "Dwarf" people,
90



with round pudgy faces. They seem to be relegated to doing the menial chores during a contact. Yet another race is what could be dubbed the Bird People. This group’s most pronounced feature is a broad, downward-sloping proboscis, somewhat like an oversize broad bird beak or flexible dolphin beak, with the mouth underneath the beak. These Visitors have graceful ovoid heads, and long thin necks. They have thin, horizontal, slit-like eyes with dark pupils. They are telepathic, kind- hearted, and powerful healers and teachers. In some instances the Visitor a person thinks they see may not be the actual appearance of the Star Visitor. I have encountered reports where the Experiencer believed that the Star Visitor s/he was dealing with appeared to be a human. However, in some cases, this turned out to be an Star Visitor-imposed mental visualization in the mind of the experiencer, the so-called "screen memory". Upon closer looking, under hypnosis, the experiencer was able to see the actual nonhuman face of the Star Visitor behind the mentally-imposed "human" mask. My favorite variation of this mental cloaking experience occurred to one experiencer who believed she was encountering a human "spaceman". I invited the Experiencer to look closely and carefully at the face of the "human spaceman". When she did so, she suddenly was startled. "Oh, my", she said," It's not a human after all. It's one of those Greys." Other details made me suspect we were still not done. I suggested she study closely the face of her "Grey" Visitor. Startled, she could see that it was a "Reptoid" who had previously cloaked himself to her mind so as to appear as a "Grey", and therefore not as startling in appearance as a Reptoid.. Then there are the light beings, the energy beings, and the pure, disembodied consciousnesses. The light and energy beings do not have a solid, three-dimensional body, but rather their presence is marked by the presence of an ill-defined mass of light or other energy. In the case of the pure consciousness beings, the only signal of their presence is the onset of telepathic contact, and, occasionally, their influence on something in the local environment. Undoubtedly, many more races could be described. These various Star Visitor races are not just coming to Earth willy-nilly. These civilizations have organized into confederations for unified planning and action. And thus, their interaction with Earth is coordinated. According to Dr. Michael Wolf, several confederations of extraterrestrial civilizations are visiting us in loosely-coordinated fashion. These are: the Alliance (of human-looking ETs from the Altair Aquila system), the Corporate (of Greys from the Zeta Reticuli system), the Federation of Worlds (of unspecified races from many star systems), and the United Races of Orion (cultures from those star systems). Furthermore, the Alliance is in affiliation with the Corporate and with the Federation of Worlds. The United Races of Orion are in affiliation with the Corporate, and, through them, with the Alliance and the Federation of Worlds. We as humans are challenged by intelligent life that looks so different from us, a challenge which some can find disturbing. But it can also remind us that the Source of All is myriad in its expression of lifeforms, including intelligent lifeforms, across the vast Universe. Only the most anthropocentric would be offended by the Supreme Source's choice to create intelligence in other anatomical packages besides primate-based. And, indeed, Star Visitor messages tell us that we, too, are a special variant mix of intelligent life: part-Earth primate, partStar Visitor intelligent lifeform. Thus, when any of us has an encounter with a Star Visitor, we truly are meeting our "distant cousins". Then there is the matter of societal organization among the Star Nations. Is each culture operating in a freelance way? Or are there overarching organizational structures coordinating the
91



efforts of each with Earth? An answer comes from one Star Visitor, Neuman, who answers three questions about Star Visitor organization in a dialogue with Marian MacNeil, who in turn provided this transcription.
“Question 1: What is the purpose of the Councils and Federations?”
"The Federations and the Councils within are important frameworks of the advanced Star Visitors. These enable us to have an organized plan as we go about observing and assisting groups of evolving Beings, such as yourselves . . . Terra humans. As species develop into viable Universal beings, we invite groups to join one or more of the Federations. We have more than one Federation. Their representatives are then chosen to maintain the Main overseeing group for Star Visitors. The individual Federations have full control over their group operations. "You might picture the Main Federation like your UN Security Council, which keeps abreast of the activities of main body of the U.N.. Most Federations have representatives from other Federations. This large network works very well for and in the various dimensions, including the third dimension. "Before a young species group is admitted into a Federation, the core representatives must approve them. Much research goes into the acceptance of these new species. This observing takes 'time' as you know it, watching many thousands of years for development in physical, mental and very importantly, the Spiritual growth of any species. This facet includes the emotional balance of individuals and as a whole . "Federations operate in 'sectors' although there is an overlap of sectors. It depends on the 'interests' of each Federation group. Many different species groups are aware of the activities going on, on your Earth planet, not only you humans but all life and the planet itself. We observe and enhance all living creatures from time to time. This takes many, many years of your time awareness. "Since your humanity's era of the industrial Revolution, your species has changed the aura, should we say, the makeup, of earth energies and other life forms on your planet. The extinction of many species shows that the changes disrupted the energies so those species could no longer survive on the planet. Not good. "Your most recent times have been devastating to al life forms. Earth is in a crisis! This shows us that Earth humanity is not progressing in the proper way as a whole. Those you title light workers, and others who are developing positive awareness, are observed, assisted and adjusted for future work among the Federations. Earth, herself, is transforming and becoming lighter on many levels. This process releases unwanted 'times', toxins, and negative energies she has been forced to endure over the past several hundreds of years."
"Question 2: What does it mean to be presented before the Councils?”
"As you have stated, My Little One, having the opportunity to be with a Council is an honor for terra humans. It is an honor for the Star Visitor research group monitoring your Spirit Energies. A host of humanity has been presented before a Council. The Council views the truth of one's Spirit, the balancing of actions with missions, the Intention created by the Core of the Spirit evolving while on your planet. As a Being evolves on your planet, we find the original Intention sometimes gets dislodged as the energy forces of the life take over for a time. The key is the budding awareness or awakening. This is what we look for during these individual and
92



group reviews. We view the various energy levels, impart energy to each, give messages and make adjustments by thought transference during those meetings. Even when one is unaware, conscious-wise, a meeting is very valuable to that being. The awakening of consciousness often starts with a review or some other type of experience with the Star Visitors. Councils help Star Visitor 'Guides' in determining when the time is right for individual awakening experiences. Various Councils across the span of the dimensional Universe review many, many groups of young species."
"Question 3: Is humanity a representative of the Star Federations?”
"These reviews take place over the thousands of years. The various Councils report to the Federations, the basic 'Missions' of the individual groups of beings, whether it is technical or more Spiritual and the progress made, or not made. These observations show which Federation will benefit by the inclusion of that specific species into that specific Federation. It is not until the young group has found the positive, peaceful balance between technology and 'Spiritology', is that group able to join any Federation. Until inclusion, we allow only observation of the younger groups. Adjustments, total awareness (disclosure) and acceptance of total reality is available to these young groups as they evolve. The reviews include still unaware individuals which are basic 'representatives' of your humanity. Until they include the group in a Federation, individuals of a group do not represent the Federation. “I remain, Neuman"
Real Images of the Star Visitors
There are many fanciful images of “aliens” in popular culture and on the Internet. But accurate drawings of Star Visitors, not to mention authentic photos, are in very short supply. Therefore, I have assembled a number of authentic images of some of the more commonly-encountered Star Visitors, and placed his collection on the Internet at my personal site, Dr. Richard Boylan’s Official Website, www.drboylan.com/StarVisitorPictures/VisitorPhotos.html To give these images additional informational value, I am providing here a description of some of the various Star Visitor races more commonly seen in contact with Earth. At my website I have assembled drawings, and in a very few cases, photos, of these Star Visitors. (For many of the drawings I am indebted to the talented work of David Chace, a Washington State illustrator, who has graciously provided permission for his drawings of Star Visitors to be reproduced in this book. David developed his drawings based on verbal descriptions given to him by experiencers who had been in actual contact with various Star Visitors.) For convenience I am describing the various races shown at my website in approximately the same order as the illustrations appear at my website. The first set are the Zeta Reticulans. These are often mislabeled "the Greys", although races looking very similar come in hues of brown, pale white, orange, black, and bluish. Also, races looking quite similar to the Zetas come with variously three-, four-, and sixfingered hands. It is doubtful that all these races came from one planet in the Zeta Reticuli system. Perhaps some of these races come from elsewhere. Since these races are older than we
93



are, it is possible that some races are the result of interbreeding with other races of dissimilar origin. The drawing of “Oris” by Amanda, a 12-year-old Australian girl, depicts a Zeta Reticulan Elder with whom she has regular communicative contact. The "Amoco ad" Star Visitor looks only superficially like a Zeta, and clearly is from a different race group. I do not have information on his star system-of-origin; (although the U.S. Naval Space Command- Intelligence Division probably does.) :-) This race of Star Visitors may be similar to the race I encountered in the desert outside Deming, New Mexico. It may also resemble the being in the drawing entitled "Zanna", an experiencer drawing which occurs later in the set. The race whose face is depicted on the August 21, 2001 Chilbolton crop circle is not identified with certainty. What is known is that in 1974, Carl Sagan and other scientists in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project used the modified Arecibo, Puerto Rico giant radio telescope dish to beam out into space a 20-trillion-watt radio signal with encoded messages about what we look like, our DNA, etc. This powerful signal was aimed at the globular star cluster M13, some 25,000 light years away and consisting of some 300,000 stars in the constellation of Hercules. Obviously, with 300,000 stars, it is not possible to determine which one had a planet whose inhabitants received our signal and replied in kind. Indeed, it is quite likely that the signal was intercepted by a race from another locale traveling in deep space aboard their mother ship, since the SETI signal will not reach the M13 globular cluster for another 24,973 years. The folks who intercepted the Arecibo coded signal deep in space responded by placing an image of their countenance as a crop circle right next to a British astronomical observatory at Chilbolton, England, where the astronomers couldn’t miss it. (Although it took them several days to notice it.) They also placed another crop circle right next to the first, with their responses to the images sent out by Carl Sagan and crew. They substituted for the Arecibo transmitter an image of their different kind of transmitter. To our panel representing the elements which make up life on Earth they added an additional constituent in their world: silicon. To our image of a DNA strand they responded with a DNA image which features an extra strand on the left side of the DNA double-helix, and changes in the number of nucleotides in their DNA. To our solar system diagram, emphasizing the third planet (us), they respond with their solar system diagram suggesting that intelligent life occurs on not only their third, but also fourth and fifth planets out from their star. To our stick-figure drawing of a human, they reply with a stick-figure drawing of themselves featuring a considerably larger head (and brain case). (Are we the pin-heads of the local galaxy?) The Star Visitors I met in my "first" (recalled) encounter, in the New Mexico desert in April, 1992, superficially resemble the "Amoco ad" race, except that they had four long fingers, whereas "my" Star Visitors had three. So, clearly these are different races. The "Homely Troll" Star Visitors are, as I have mentioned previously, are squat and powerful figures, who do the heavy lifting for the more delicately-built Zeta Reticulans, with whom they are often seen. The Hybrids are just that: various combinations of persons whose genetic makeup is a combination of various Star Visitor races, or a Star Visitor race and Earth human DNA. Neuman is of a Star Visitor group with general humanoid features, but a striking large proboscis shaped like an oversized bird or dolphin beak. This feature has perhaps given rise to the nickname the Bird People, although you will note that Neuman has neither wings nor
94



feathers. Another Star Visitor race with large rostrum is the dolphin, an intelligent, communicative extraterrestrial species seeded on Earth long ago, according to Dr. Michael Wolf of the National Security Council’s Special Studies Group [nee “MJ-12"]. He also commented that the whales are another intelligent species seeded here eons ago. The levitating orbs of light depicted in the photos are conscious intelligent packages of luminous energy, who can travel and focus on persons of interest, and have conducted telepathicvisual dialogue with humans. They often hover near people they especially wish to notice, and quite often show up in photographs, even though persons at the time saw nothing optically. The very human-like male and female figures depicted are often dubbed "Nordics", because they appear in some ways like humans from Scandinavian countries. Not all "Nordics" wear close-fitting jumpsuits or tunics; some are seen in flowing robes, for example. These “Nordic” Star Visitor races come variously from the Pleiades System and the fourth and fifth planets of the Altair binary star in the Aquila System, and other locations. Dakota Sioux Star Altar-Keeper Golden Eagle {Standing Elk} says that the Dakota people have a tradition which recognizes that the origins of the human race are from the Pleiades, Orion and Sirius Systems (Personal communication, June 21, 1996). Thus, when people marvel at how human-like the "Nordic" Star Visitors appear, they should rather comment about how Pleiadean-like we humans look. Thus, that would be getting the origin-sequence in the proper order. The Praying Mantis Star Visitors are my personal favorites for their light, gentle and highly-conscious vibes. They illustrate that intelligence can evolve within the Insectoid phylum, and is not confined to the Primate phylum. Praying Mantis folk are tall, ethereal, of very high vibratory energy, very conscious, very loving, very spiritual and metaphysical in their attunement. Their heads are much larger and more developed proportional to their torso than in the Earth insect of the same name, to accommodate their highly intelligent brain case. The Asia Minor figurine photo depicts a Reptoid (Reptilian) Star Visitor. The following drawing is of "Ruby" a female Reptoid who visited an experiencer. Again, these Reptoids illustrate that conscious intelligence can evolve in the Reptilian phylum as well as the Primate and Insectoid. These Star Visitors are wise, inquisitive, sometimes stern and can exude an air of scientific detachment. They have a very strong presence and energy field, something like being in the presence of a 350 lb. linebacker, which some experiencers can find intimidating, while others do not. The Reptoids have been especially targeted by Cabal propaganda for being made out to be menacing villains. (The Cabal disinformers apparently wish to capitalize on some humans' natural repulsion at Earth's scaly reptiles. I was a kid who grew up catching lizards and horned toads, so for me reptiles are no big deal. But Cabal propaganda about “them nasty reptilians” has duped many.) The extraterrestrial symbols shown are from an I-beam retrieved from the Roswell UFO which crashed in mid-1947. They have been decoded by Golden Eagle, with Spirit's help, in inipi (sacred lodge) as being the 11:11, Eleven Spiritual Laws and the Eleven Universal Laws of the cosmos. (Sort of like the Ten Commandments of the Universe.) These principles are widely recognized and accepted across star cultures. Imagine a civilization which etches its principles into the side of its spacecraft! Perhaps humans would behave differently if we etched the Ten Commandments into the side of our aircraft, like the Defense Department's new YF-22 Raptor
95



Advanced Tactical Fighter. (With special highlighting of Commandment #5: “Thou shalt not kill.”) The photos of the Star Visitor spacecraft low over the jungle near Montemorelos, Nuevo Leon State, Mexico, near the Texas border, were taken in 1993 by Pepe Martinez, associate of famed Mexican photojournalist Santiago Ytturia-Garza. The craft has three prominent hemispherical protrusions from its bottom side. These might coincide with the directed antigravity generators physicist Bob Lazar talked about in his work dissecting and analyzing retrieved Star Visitor scout ships at the Papoose Dry Lake government lab at S-4, near Area 51, Nellis Air Force Base Range, central Nevada, U.S. These are but a few of the myriad of intelligent races which creation has sprinkled across the cosmos. While these are some of the more commonly-encountered Star Visitor groups, do not be surprised if the Visitors who come and meet with you look somewhat different. There are many, many races out there collaborating to try to wake up, inspire and motivate the human race to reach its highest destiny. Out there, as on Earth, "It takes a village to raise a child."
Various Star Visitor Races and Human Contacting Abilities
A correspondent and I had the following dialogue, which may serve to shed additional light on the Star Visitor-human equation.
Correspondent: “What seem to be confusing to many people is the great variation of ET species, and also the variation of different kinds of non-physical entities on Earth. Furthermore, we humans ourselves seem to be multidimensional. I am thinking of our ability to travel out of body. Put together we have a quite complicated situation. Do you know of any occasion where an ET has tried to explain how these things go together?”
Dr. Boylan responds: “The picture simplifies somewhat when we diminish the us-and-them mentality of separation, and recognize our common roots. Humans are a hybrid species who owe our very existence to handiwork from Visitors from the stars. (Further details on the Star Visitor contribution to human development can be found in Chapter Six. ) “I have already provided a modestly-comprehensive description of the various races in contact with Earth. “Because humans have Star Visitor genes admixed with those of Earth, we have more rapidly developed than would have been the case waiting for unaccelerated evolutionary development. And because of our resultant speeded-up metaphysical endowment, we are capable of such “non-physical” operations as out-of-body travel and remote viewing. And we are thus equipped to meet and interface with beings who are less-than-physically-solid in their selfpresentation and/or who come to us from across from a different dimension, as well as perfectlysolid Star Visitor races who are also quite adept at out-of-body travel/astral projection.”
More details on Dolphins as an intelligent sentient species of Star Visitor origin

Presented here is an interview with my friend, dolphin communication authority Joan Ocean of Hawai’i. The interview is conducted by my friend, psychic and writer Paula Peterson. Dr. Michael Wolf, late consultant to the U.S. National Security Council, told me that dolphins are an intelligent extraterrestrial species seeded here long time ago, as were the whales. This interview provides additional excellent information. Paula Peterson prefaces her interview with a leading authority on dolphins as follows. “Regarded as an authority on the subject of dolphin and whale communication, Joan Ocean developed the remarkable methodologies for this pioneering work and authored two books translated into four languages: Dolphin Connection and Dolphins into the Future. For nearly two decades, Joan has led thousands the world over into the waters to swim and communicate with the dolphins, to discover the wondrous, often mystical world of these highly intelligent beings with abilities that continue to amaze and baffle us all.
“Voices in the Sea” by Paula J. Peterson with Joan Ocean
PJP: How did your work with dolphins and whales begin?
JO: It was surprise to me! I didn't even know how to swim when I first met the dolphins. It was back in the early eighties and people were not as aware of dolphins back then. The dolphins first came to me while I was in meditation and gave me a beautiful message of having much to share with humanity. The energy felt very good. But, I was a little embarrassed to tell anyone that I was channeling dolphins. So, I kept it secret. I wondered how could I work with dolphins and whales when I don't even swim or go into the ocean at all.
Later, I released the dolphin's message to a friend who printed it in his newsletter that circulated throughout the United States. There was a great response to it. Many people wrote to me making statements like, "I felt all along that one could communicate with dolphins. Thank you for sharing that information."
This encouraged me to talk more openly about it and to continue having more experiences. Then as fate would have it, I was invited on a trip to the Amazon River in Peru to meet the river dolphins. Since I already had contact with them in meditation, I agreed right away.
It was a beautiful experience. I still didn't know how to swim. But I had a lifejacket on and the water was quite calm, so I felt okay with it. After that, I began traveling to other countries sharing stories about my experiences with the dolphins. That is how it began.
PJP: Did you also have experiences with the whales at that time?
JO: The whales affected my vibrational frequency right in the beginning. Around this same time, I met Jean-Luc Bozzoli, an incredible dolphin and visionary artist whose art touched me right to the heart. We began traveling together: I would tell stories about dolphins and he would show his art. As a result, we were invited all over the world to meet and swim with dolphins.
97



One time, we were involved with an environmental group in a month-long project off the coast of British Columbia. We lived in tents, and at night, we sat around the fire with the others on this deserted island. There were eagles and Orcas - it was a beautiful uninhabited place and the experience was wonderful.
One day, we were standing on the shore when a California Grey Whale came in really close. He seemed to be rolling on the pebbles beneath the water, scratching his back, and removing barnacles. When he came in even closer, there was eye contact. As I looked into that eye, and as he returned my gaze, I felt all this love and wisdom pouring into me in vibrational waves. I felt as though he understood and knew me. It was powerful.
There came a point where I couldn't take any more of those waves of love: I thought I might melt or disappear! The minute I had this thought, the whale stopped sending those vibrational waves. It was then that I realized that whales could communicate with us. He had received my thoughts and knew to stop sending those waves of love.
From then on, my interest has always been in communicating with dolphins and whales, and to share my experiences with others.
PJP: The Australian Aborigines and other Indigenous tribes consider dreaming of dolphins very important. Besides meeting dolphins in meditation, have you had dreams of them?
JO: Yes. Even before going to the Amazon, I had dreamed of pink dolphins, having no idea that they really existed. I remember waking up thinking. "Now wasn't that a pleasant dream -to see dolphins that were pink."
In the beginning I dreamed a lot more about dolphins before I met them. Now, since I spend so much time with them in the water, they're always with me. I don't have specific dreams of dolphins as much now. It seems that our fields of energy have merged in a way that I've become a part of them.
PJP: You speak of telepathic communication - or perhaps a more appropriate word is telempathic. What is it like to have that experience?
JO: That is a word I also use: instead of the word telepathic or empathy, I combine the two into tel-empathy. I've found that the dolphins respond to feelings - that's empathy. They understand what you're feeling when you're swimming with them. I take many people out in boats, and some of them don't even know how to swim. Once in the water, the dolphins will sense this right away and be more cautious by keeping their distance, and not doing anything to startle the people. The dolphins will gently approach them and wait until they feel that people are comfortable. Then they will come in closer.
Tel-empathy is a big part of contacting the dolphins and communicating. When I'm out in the boat with a group, we meditate first to contact the dolphins. I will usually send out a beam of light from my heart chakra and send another one out from my third eye. A triangulation is
98



created as the beam from the third eye and the heart connects with each other. But the most important part I've found is the empathy or the feelings that go with the image. At the same time I'm sending the image, I think about swimming with the dolphins along with the feeling of joy in my heart and the love I have for them. It's the feeling that seems to be the conduit -the bioelectric conductor -that sends my thoughts and my request for them to come and swim with us. That is the energy that somehow delivers the message and this is what they pick up. They can feel far beyond our ability to feel. And the water amplifies that ability.
PJP: Would you say, then, that communication with dolphins takes place on a feeling level more so than on a mental level?
JO: Actually, it's both. The mental is a big part of it and thoughts are important. A person may have a thought such as, "Oh, I can't swim that fast I wish you would slow down" - and the dolphins will slow down.
As another example, I keep records of the different dolphins and have come to know over 200 by name, based on marks on their bodies: birth marks or injuries they have had in the past. I like to know if they're male or female, and when a new dolphin comes along, I'll have the thought, "Are you a male or a female?" In response, they will roll over right away and show me their underside.
In many ways they can read thoughts. I'll be with a group of dolphins and when I see that one is missing and I'll think, "Is Ragged Fin here today?" All of a sudden, he will come up from behind and zip right up in front of me.
Another way of communicating is through cellular communication. I have found that instead of sending information directly into our brains or into our minds - which they are certainly doing they are also sending information into all the cells of our body.
PJP: Can knowledge of cellular intelligence help us to understand more about human behavior?
JO: We are not generally aware of cellular intelligence although the dolphins seem to be aware of it. What's interesting is the latest research involving organ transplants. Biologists are finding that the behavior and characteristics of the organ donor are sometimes showing up in the body of the recipient. It seems as though the intelligence, behavior, and feelings of the organ donor remains in the cells even though the organ is placed into a different person.
PJP: So what can this tell us about eating animals?
JO: It can definitely have the same effect. Many who live here have said that those who eat meat all the time here on the island -like the cowboys and other meat-eaters - have a more aggressive behavior pattern and more leathery skin. The way that animals get killed for meat also causes fear in the cells of the animal's body - and people are eating that, too.
PJP: In what other ways do dolphins and whales communicate?
99



JO: Dolphins and whales also communicate through a tonal language which they use to contact us. When I was in the Azores with the Sperm Whales, I learned that the males can dive down more than 6000 feet and that the sounds they make are not pretty. They make clicks and static at depths where the sounds can be more easily transmitted. The dolphins and the whales also use echo-location, which is a way of producing sound.
PJP: Is that similar to their sonar?
JO: Yes. They send out sound waves and it moves toward the object they are focused on. When the echo from the object bounces back, it gives the dolphin or whale an acoustic picture of the environment - or the other whale or the other person that's in the water with them. It's interesting that in order to interpret the sounds, the sounds have to be loud enough for the echo to bounce back to the dolphin or whale and short enough so that the echo of one sound bounces back before the next sound is sent out. The sounds are sent out in all directions from a cavity located in front of their brain, called the melon.
As they make these sounds, they are definitely directing these toward our bodies if we are in the water swimming with them. When dolphins get really close to me, the interval between their clicks is so short, that it's very much like a buzzing sound. Sound conveys a lot more information than light. Light is the way a human can see things, through our human eyes. But sound provides a lot more information. For example, studies have shown that when scanning a fish dolphins can distinguish whether the fish is toxic or non-toxic.
PJP: : What kind of an affect do these sounds have on our brains?
JO: Interesting studies have shown that when the left hemisphere of the human brain is sedated that person cannot speak - they can sing but they cannot speak. On the other hand, if the right hemisphere of the brain is sedated then the person can speak but cannot sing. Dolphins, with their sounds, seem to be stimulating the right hemisphere of the human brain, activating the dormant potential and higher senses -like the sixth sense. PJP: How can a person open themselves up to telepathic communication with dolphins?
JO: The big part of that is about asking. It's amazing how something so simple is often what people don't do. When I communicate with dolphins, I enter a meditative state and become very relaxed. It helps to have music with dolphin or whale sounds which can be very profound. When you get into that expanded state, visualize them, think about them, and feel the dolphins and whales as best you can. Imagine yourself swimming with them. Imagine diving down, staying under water, and not worrying about having to breathe. Join them in their world by visualizing it, experiencing it, and being with them in the dreamtime in that way. Since water and the higher frequency of light are very similar you can swim in either one of them.
Once you feel you've made a connection with them ask if they have something to share with you. Have a pen and pad of paper ready and you can write while remaining in that expanded state of awareness with the dolphins and whales. Just write what comes without putting any judgment or criticism on it - just let it flow. Even if it seems awkward at first, you will eventually receive more information. Some people will receive messages through images, some through sound and
100



feeling, and some through the body kinesthetically. There are also those who receive communication from the dolphins in poetry or song.
PJP: Do we need to be near dolphins or whales to have telepathic communication?
JO: We can be anywhere. As I said before, my contact with dolphins began in the living room of my house where I was sitting in meditation. When you can get into that quiet space and focus on them, they'll be there. I like to go into the shower, the bathtub or the pool since being in the water enhances communication. Water is a conduit for sending and receiving information. Vibrational frequencies travel eight times faster in water than in the air. When you get a feeling that you want to make contact, just do it right then.
Dolphins and whales come into the dreamtime, during our sleep, and, for me, they even enter conversations I have with people. Even at times when I'm writing on the computer they will suddenly come in.
PJP: Are there other ways that dolphins and whales affect us on land?
JO: There was a wonderful story in the Los Angeles Times quite a few years ago that set a good example of the effect of whale sounds. There were peculiar circumstances with Cadillacs being driven along the Pacific Coast Highway in California. Owners of the cars were returning them to the dealers because the electric door locks and the trunk lids were strangely popping up and down as they were driving. The company recalled the cars and their investigation revealed that the electrical systems were being set off by the sounds of the whales migrating along the coastline. We can be anywhere on land and the dolphin and whale frequencies are reaching us.
PJP: : Along those lines it's often been said that dolphins have the ability to communicate in holographic images. Can you speak to us about that? JO: It's true. I feel they communicate holographically as well as making "surround" sounds. Holographic is an image that includes all information in one shot, so to speak. Like one burst of energy. As an example, if I said to you, "the children are playing on the beach", everyone who heard this would create a different picture in their mind of how it would look -the age of the children, the clothes they are wearing, if they're playing ball or something else -because no one would have that information. When the dolphins send me information, everything I need to know comes all at once -holographically.
PJP: Humans often try to get animals, and in particular dolphins, to speak human language which is difficult for them. My feeling is that we need to learn how to communicate from the heart which is closer to their level.
JO: Yes, that's right. It's kind of sweet -like what John Lilly did in teaching the dolphins some words. It touches my heart that the dolphins are so willing to work with us that they sort of go along with it.
Dolphins don't have vocal cords and they're not going to form words. They're making sounds out of the melon in their heads. Their communication has more to do with tel-empathy and a heart
101



connection. The information comes in on a cellular level, into your entire body. As humans swimming along side the dolphins we may wonder, "Where did that piece of information come from? How did that get in there?" I like to say that the dolphins and whales are giving us answers before we know enough to ask the question.
They are frequently communicating in ways that are beyond our understanding. It's much like joining a foreign culture or tribe -at first you wouldn't understand a word they were saying. Yet, the longer you live with them, the more you learn the language.
I encourage people to mimic the dolphins and make sounds as much as possible when we swim with them. It's very powerful to do that. When we make sounds with them, we move into a state of love. We name that vibration love -a particular vibration that feels so beautiful, joyful, and peaceful. The dolphins are already in that state at all times. And if we put out a sound that mimic's theirs, we start to resonate with that same frequency.
It's interesting that these sounds can take us beyond time and space -beyond third dimensional reality. Going beyond constraints, we can enter unlimited time and have experiences of traveling interdimensionally, bi-locating or just expanding time right where we are; so that when we get out of the water after swimming, we look at the clock and it shows we've been out there swimming for an hour, but it feels, instead, as though we've been out there for eight hours.
PJP: What can you tell us about the dolphin's ability to heal?
JO: I've seen so much healing happen when it comes to being with the dolphins. By using their sonar they can determine if we are missing any frequencies we need in order to be healthy. Then, they can make that missing sound, which is beyond our hearing, and send the sound to heal us in that way. There is a lot of interesting research being done on this now which is fascinating. Dolphins also use their sonar to scan our bodies to find if there is a block or an imbalance. They will often find blocks in the body from previous operations or injuries and they will sonar them. This can cause a release of trapped anesthesia -which we can smell.
PJP: Is this why dolphins can have such a beneficial effect on autistic and other dis-abled children?
JO: Yes. I have taken many children with all different disabilities out to the dolphins and the results have been phenomenal. One such child was nine years old, who had undergone 150 operations on her brain and had to be carried every where. After she swam with the dolphins she was able to walk up and down stairs. In addition, every time she counted from one to twenty she would always skip the number 16 for some reason. After swimming with the dolphins, she no longer skipped the number 16. She was much more responsive to people, and was gentle and loving. I had them tape record the results so that I would always have this to remember.
At another time, a Japanese girl with autism swam with the dolphins. She had the typical autistic behavior of avoiding eye contact, being withdrawn, and lost in her own world. Once in the water with the dolphins, she began making sounds while the dolphins were making sounds. We brought her back on land and I'll never forget this: after taking off her life-jacket, she walks into
102



my backyard -which is right there on the ocean -goes over to a bush, picks a flower, walks over to me, looks right into my eyes and hands it to me. It was deeply touching. Her parents started crying. She had not been interacting with anyone in any way prior to this.
PJP: That is so moving. I work part-time with autistic and dis-abled children and I love hearing hopeful stories like this.
JO: I feel so fortunate to be able to experience it often. It's not always the easiest thing to do - I have to get helpers and some big guys to lift the handi-capped. We've had adults in their twenties to forties who have cerebral palsy or have suddenly become paralyzed. We have to be able to lift them up into the boat since their legs don't operate. It takes a lot of cooperation with people working together to make it happen. But it is always worth it and so meaningful for everyone.
PJP: It has been said that if we want to contact alien beings we should start with the dolphins since they are the other intelligence race that inhabits this planet. Could you comment on this?
JO: Personally, I feel that this is very true. And this is a major part of my work. I feel that the dolphins are preparing us to be in communication with cultures from other planets. They are accomplishing this in an acceptable way since people love dolphins and can relate to them. Dolphins and humans have similarities and we can communicate with each other. They're also joyful and playful. And even though they've got a big mouthful of teeth, people aren't afraid of them.
PJP: That leads me to my next question. In Dr. Michael Odent’s book, Water and Sexuality (1990), he offers a fascinating hypothesis -supported by scientific studies -claiming that humans are more closely related to dolphins than to primates. He theorizes that dolphins and humans have a common ancient ancestor. What do you think of this?
JO: I feel that it's true. I also believe that dolphins and humans can incarnate into each others forms. That might not be true of all animals, but I feel that it's true with the dolphins. I also feel that the dolphins have remained in contact with beings from other planets as we were able to do back in the days of Atlantis and at other times as well. The general human population seems to have lost the memory of having had that contact. The dolphins, however, are still in contact.
I was personally aware of energies from Sirius before I met the dolphins. I noticed that when I met the dolphins it felt very much like the brightest star in our skies - Sirius. When I asked the dolphins about it, they said that they were not directly from Sirius but that they contain the energies of Sirius within their being.
PJP: Are there any ancient records or texts that allude to dolphins coming from another planet?
JO: There are myths. The story of the D[ogon] tribe in Africa is a well known account, yet is still interesting to tell. When explorers first discovered the tribe, the D[ogon] had never seen white men or anyone from the western world. When the explorers asked where the D[ogon] had come from, the tribesmen drew diagrams of a planet with twin suns -Sirius and Sirius B. Other pictures they drew in the sand and on their boats were images of dolphins. They related themselves to
103



dolphins and Sirius.
I had an amazing experience while inside the Great Pyramids of Egypt -I noticed some hieroglyphs of dolphins. With me were two Egyptologists with double Ph.D degrees. They looked at the dolphin hieroglyphs and said, "We've never seen that before. Where did that come from?"
One of the most interesting pieces of information that the dolphins have given me is their reference to a window in time. They have shown me an acoustic image of our present reality as moving along a linear pathway -a horizontal plane that they carefully enter on a vertical angle, so to speak. Once here, they rewrite history or change some things that are going on here.
Universal Law states that there cannot be interference with people on other planets and their right to make choices. However, when there is a call for help from those people, then intervention is permitted. The dolphins say they have come in through a window of time to help humanity. They intercepted our time-line, so to speak, bringing with them the history of humandolphin contact: the Roman and Greek history as well as more recent stories of dolphins and people interacting. They came into bodies in the ocean. Although, it is said that dolphins are millions of years old -and they undoubtedly are -they say, "Yes, but not on this planet."
While doing research on this, I asked my friends -the Hawaiian Kahunas -the holy men of the Hawaii people: "Why is it that in all of your traditional chants and songs there is mention of sharks, turtles, and the other sea-life, but there is no mention of dolphins? Nothing. And you are descendants of a sea-faring people." They responded by saying that dolphins were not here.
When we talk about how old the dolphins are and where are they from - we must think in terms of multi-dimensional universes - not just this one. The dolphins say that when they make these very high frequency sounds while swimming with them, it's taking us beyond time and space constraints. We can have a similar experience as they did when they entered our reality. They used sound to stop everything, to come in and create a reality of being with us. They also say that they've come here in to the physical plane to teach us about non-physical reality.
PJP: I've read Douglas Anderson's wonderful book The Planet of Waters, (1988), which is a beautiful story about the planet with twin suns that was the original home of the dolphins. Do you have any thoughts to share on this?
JO: It is a beautiful story. During my seminars, I will lead people into meditation, and then read from his book. The words are so dolphin-like -it's the tone he sets, the way he strings the words together, the visuals that come up -it's the way dolphins communicate. It's like poetry, and yet it has a very profound message. I have always appreciated that book.
PJP: Tribal shamans of old allowed the spirit of a dolphin or whale to enter their body and have an intimate communication which they would then share with tribal members. They could also merge with whales or dolphins and have the experience of swimming as one of them. A sensitive person like you -sometimes called a channel -can also have these experiences. Could you tell us
104



more about this?
JO: While swimming with the dolphins for hours, I begin to merge with their essence. It's like shape-shifting. I often feel that they, in turn, are experimenting with being in a human body and having fun with that. They become me and I become them -we merge with each other. At times, I get into such a high frequency of love, that my whole body changes its composition. I, as well as others, have had the experience of becoming invisible. It's not really so unusual. I've seen this happen in meditation, where some people achieve such a high state of consciousness that a person goes in and out of physical reality -now you see them, now you don't. The dolphins have that same affect when you spend a lot of time with them.
There have been times, while swimming with a group when the others will start looking around for me because they can't see me. Once I feel that people are beginning to worry, it always brings me back.
PJP: What is the most important message that dolphins and whales are giving us about living here on planet earth?
JO: They are showing us the examples of living in harmony with nature by living in harmony with each other. That is so important. And of course, they are living examples of joy and gratitude. One other important message is in teaching us to go beyond our five senses. It's interesting that they often don't want us to touch them, or hold onto them ,or even to see them at times. We already know how to do all that. Instead, they want us to stretch beyond that, to use our other senses, and to communicate with them on that level.
They want us to understand that we are not alone in the universe, for the sake of our planet, and for our own well-being. It's essential that we acknowledge that there are other civilizations in the universe that can be of benefit to us and who are willing to be helpful. We don't want to approach them as the enemy. We need to approach them in the same way we approach the dolphins -with love and openness.
PJP: In closing, what else would you like us to know?
JO: People have found that when swimming with the dolphins memories from their entire life may flash before them. They may remember negative things that happened in their childhood: perhaps they were abused, neglected, mistreated, or their parents weren't there for them when needed. When this happens, people will often be crying in their masks. The dolphin's message encourages people to focus on the positive things that happened in their lives and make this the impetus for their choices in life rather than the negative.
The dolphins once asked me, "Why does the human race focus on the negative things that happen and base their lives on this?" They want people to rewrite their past and focus on the beautiful and good things that happened and then move forward in their lives with gratitude.
PJP: Thank you, Joan, for this wonderful, playful time that you've shared with us. Our love and respect for dolphins and whales can only grow as we learn more about them through dedicated

Chapter 8
The Star Visitors Are Not the “Evil Mean Invaders” of Propaganda
The contradictory presentations on the Star Visitors that one sees on television and in magazines and books and on the Internet, purporting to describe what “aliens” are like and the purpose of their contact with Earth, make it hard for many people to try to sort out what is the truth. These portrayals of “ETs” vary so widely. Some of these presentations are sensationalistic, and intentionally so. Because “voltage” sells, and many in the media are interested only in what sells. Thus, the most lurid and macabre tales about “Star Visitors” are presented. Other presentations are propaganda pieces, placed in the media as a second-ditch strategy by the plutocratic Cabal behind the UFO Cover-Up. Since the Cabal has enormous international wealth at its disposal, it has the funds and influence to make sure that the majority of presentations which make it to public view are negativistic in tone. Their thinking is that if they can’t sell you the lie that “UFOs don’t exist”, then their fall-back strategy is to convince you that “they are evil mean invaders.” Thus, the presentations they finance and promote feature the Star Visitors as invaders, torturers, plotters and monsters. The factual presentations in the media are the result of some producers’ careful sifting of the facts from creative fantasy and disinformation, and relying on scientific research by qualified professionals who have ventured into the rarified field of Star Visitor-human encounters. The producers who care about truth above “voltage”, who are smart enough to get the expertise to sift truth from fiction and disinformation, and who are courageous enough to push their production through despite dissuasion by the negative climate created by Cabal’s henchmen in the media, are in the minority. But their work is wonderful, illuminating and exciting! How do those who want to find and present the truth about Star Visitor-human encounters get the real facts? Where can they go to get reality, instead of disinformation? It is a given that in researching reports of extraterrestrial encounters, the only “evidence” available to study are the human persons involved, the experiencers. And so, the only discipline producing really qualified researchers of persons claiming extraterrestrial encounters is behavioral science. Thus, it is only qualified behavioral science professionals who have the necessary education, supervised training and professional experience to gather, evaluate, sort and discriminate reports, and collate reliable research findings about Star Visitor-human encounters. Such behavioral science professionals have the following five advancedresearch qualifications: 1)behavioral science and medical professionals, e.g., psychologists, psychiatrists, clinical social workers, marriage, child and family therapists, and certified clinical hypnotherapists, who ideally have a doctorate, or at least a master's degree, 2) plus many years of clinical experience, including skills in differential diagnosis, 3) plus formal graduate training in research methodology, 4) plus are open-minded enough to inquire objectively into extraterrestrial phenomena
107



without presuppositions, and are willing to let the data determine the findings; and, 5) have educated themselves sufficiently about UFO and Star Visitor matters, and also about the widespread prevalence of disinformation, to have an informed beginning basis for doing research. As the President of the Academy of Clinical Close Encounter Therapists, I have had the opportunity to have talked to hundreds of such professionals involved in this kind of highlyspecialized work with persons who claim Star Visitor encounters. In so doing, I do not find credible reports of so-called "low-life aliens" from these professionals, nor from the experiencers they have worked with. On the contrary, the reports coming from behavioral science professionals describe intelligent, wise, compassionate, interested Star Visitors, who want what is best for our world and theirs. While the theoretical possibility of “evil aliens” may be postulated, in fact those civilizations which have evolved far enough to have both the inclination and the surplus resources to reach out into space to nurture fledgling planets are not marauders. The coalition of civilizations making gradually-open contact with Earth have rightly been called since ancient times “The Watchers”. These “Watchers” are prepared to filter out any (theoretical) marauders who might decide to drop by this blue planet. This overview of the visiting cultures as well-intentioned is derived from innumerable Star Visitor communications to experiencers, and from ancient oral traditions, tribal experiences, and indigenous leaders' statements about their knowledge of the Star Nations. It is additionally supported by Dr. Michael Wolf, an insider in one of the U.S. government’s unacknowledged units within National Security Council, the Special Studies Group, (formerly known as “MJ12"), by Lt. Colonel Phillip Corso, US Army, who had contact with a Star Visitor at Holloman Air Force Base, by John Mack, M.D., Harvard Psychiatry Professor and Star Visitor-encounters researcher-therapist, and by Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D., University of Wyoming emeritus Professor, psychologist, and close-encounters researcher, among many others. As to whether the Star Visitors will "save the day" as regards Earth's ecological crises or the coming cataclysms know as Earth Changes, such projecting of responsibility onto the Star Visitors is unworthy of us and unfair to them. The Visitors tell us that it is up to us to save our own day (and planet). They will help to the extent they can without taking over our proper responsibility for our own planet, but only if asked, (and not shot at.) My analysis, and that of Drs. John Mack, R. Leo Sprinkle, Edith Fiore, Rauni Kilde, Gilda Moura, Ruth Hover, et al., is based on Star Visitor behavior over time. We have worked with multi-generation experiencer families, whose combined experience stretches back nearly a century. "Actions speak louder than words." The antidote to defamatory anti-Visitor propaganda is open and accurate information about our own history of contact with these beings. The Star Visitors’ messages contain warnings for us of dangers we are presenting to ourselves by our ecological, military, social, and economic behaviors. They provide us with important and useful information for advancing our society and ourselves mentally and spiritually. The Visitors are preparing us (via messages relayed through select human experiencers) to socially accept the reality of extraterrestrial contact, and are readying us for joining the larger community of inhabited worlds. Remember: the burden of proof is on the person alleging evil extraterrestrial races. This researcher has seen no proof of such a hypothesized group. What has been presented as "evidence" are lurid “horror stories” found in some UFO magazines and books, the truthfulness of which can be charitably called elusive, and speaking plainly, consist of fictions and
108



distortions. So, yes, the Star Visitors who interact with humans are benevolent. There are major human misunderstandings of some Star Visitors, due to human anthropomorphic tendency to lack understanding of quite different cultures and personality styles. As anthropologists have shown, in dealing with culturally very different human groups on Earth, it is incorrect to judge the culturally-different human group by the cultural standards of one's own culture. Even in America there are people who put down other ethnic groups because they think or phrase things or behave differently than "we" do. Some Star Visitor races are here to teach, some here to guide, some to heal, some to advance us culturally, some to advance us biologically, some to study us, some to passively observe, some to take samples of our flora and fauna, some to stand guard to protect us, or to protect space from our plutonium-contaminated space probes and space weapons systems. None are here to invade, none are here to kill, none are here to intimidate, none are here to militarily or culturally take over. This is not to say that we humans are the "bad guys", but we do have some less-evolved persons in our midst. That is the way it is in the universe as well, we are told. However, the difference is that the Inter-Galactic Federation keeping watch over us does not permit the lessevolved cultures on other planets to roam the galaxy freely and cause havoc on vulnerable planetary populations, such as Earth. There are reasons why we have been assigned the Watchers since our earliest times. And protection is certainly one of those reasons. Genuine interest and concern in our positive evolution and development are additional reasons. You will note that the above description is in marked contrast with the rampant disinformation spread by those who, unwittingly or knowingly, are putting out stories which serve the objectives of the rogue UFO Cover-Up. There are many of this ilk. It should be particularly noted that some of the lurid reports being palmed off on the public as examples of “alien misbehavior” are actually secret psychological warfare operations by human rogue military-intelligence abduction units (MILABS). These renegade militaryintelligence units kidnap civilians without legal authorization or justification. These units drug those they kidnap, (often experiencers). These renegades deliberately intimidate, interrogate, physically abuse, and even gang-rape the civilians they kidnap. The MILABS units then use brainwashing techniques to make the civilians they kidnap forget about the military kidnapping, while the renegades hypnotically implant a false memory about the horrific experience as an "alien abduction" This is the level of evil, distortion and treachery that the Cabal sink to. They will do anything to repress UFO truth, so as to protect their monopoly of highly-advanced extraterrestrial technology recovered from UFO crashes: a monopoly which has brought them trillions of dollars in profits over the last four-plus decades. So, when you next read an article, or watch a television presentation which purports to describe a Star Visitor-human encounter, you can ask yourself: Is it Hollywood, is it propaganda, is it fantasy, or is it the truth?

Does ET Have Flippers? An Extraterrestrial Race Resident On Earth: The Delphinids
A story in the news in 1998 did not come as a surprise to those readers familiar with NSC's Special Studies Group consultant Dr. Michael Wolf's revelation that dolphins are an intelligent extraterrestrial species seeded onto Earth. This happened not long after humankind was bioengineered from Earth primate stock by master geneticists from Zeta Reticuli, splicing into Earth primate genome some of their own genes for intelligence and dexterity. Indeed, Dr. Wolf added, the dolphins are close evolutionarily to the Zeta Reticulans [Greys], and have, for example, rather similar skin structure, are also highly telepathic, and also operate in a similar shared-mindfield culture. Thus, since some humans carry Star Visitor genetics courtesy of the Zeta Reticulans, since and the dolphins are kin to the Zetas, it would logically follow that our genetic makeup would have some similarity to the genetics of dolphins. The September, 1998 issue of Cytogenetics and Cell Genetics reported that the genetic (chromosomal) make-up of dolphins is surprisingly similar to that of humans, leading to similar traits of intelligence and frendliness. Scientists at Texas A&M University discovered that 13 of 22 dolphin chromosomes were identical to human chromosomes. And of the remaining nine, most were combinations or rearrangements of their human counterparts. The article, which describes this long-resident extraterrestrial species, makes one error: attributing the dolphin-human similarity to evolution [on Earth]. This a common mistake, given that biological science is still tied to Darwinism, and since the true facts of human origin have been kept secret (along with other Star Visitor information) by the developed countries' governments, as part of their UFO Cover-Up You will not be surprised to hear that I frequently get bombarded with messages from people who have been terrorized (and hornswaggled) by Cabal anti-“alien” propaganda. These correspondents tick off a list of nonexistent “misdeeds” supposedly done by the Star Visitors, and then they ask me some version of “Why don’t you believe that the space aliens are a threat to mankind?” My answer tends to encompass some version of the following points. Why don’t I believe that the Star Visitors are evil, mean invaders? Well, for one thing, they been here for millennia. You can’t call them invaders if they’ve been here longer than we have. And they would be pretty stupid “invaders” to wait until we develop Star Wars weapons before coming by. And the Star Visitors are anything but stupid. In view of the role of the Star Visitors in shaping the development of modern humans, as described in Chapter Six, it is obvious that they are not here to invade nor to harm us. Rather, a genuine behavioral analysis of the Star Visitors reveals that they have a peaceable nature. They come here like cosmic Peace Corps workers, to educate, to point out problems, to advise, to show solutions, and to inspire what is best and most noble within us. This is not the behavioral profile of an invader. Sometimes I get accosted by folks who try to convince me that there must be “bad aliens”, using the spurious logic that societies in space must be just like what we observe among ourselves on Earth. What kind of logic is that? What proof do they have that Earth is a
110



comprehensive model of all varieties of cosmic civilizations? None. Furthermore, how narrowminded and jingoistic and anthropocentric! The average person does not have the slightest idea what cosmic civilizations are like, because billions of dollars have been spent on precisely keeping the average citizen in the dark about the existence of any life out there, much less the true nature of space cultures. There is nothing sensible about assuming that “there are evil and good races out there just like there are good and bad people on Earth.” Terrible logic. First, Earth is a primitive society. How do we know this? Because we have been informed of this by visiting star nations who have roamed the cosmos and are informed about other intelligent civilizations out there, and are therefore in a position to make comparisons. Furthermore, we have been told by the Visitors that we will not be allowed to venture very far at all into space, until we clean up our violent, greedy, aggressive, hyper-materialistic act. Second, comparing the demographics of Earth to space is at best wild conjecture in the absence of firm information. But even if such a projection were justified, only 1% of human population are sociopaths/Antisocial Personality Disorder types/criminals. So, even using the highly-flawed assumption that “folks out there are like folks on Earth”, the conclusion to be drawn would still be that 99% of the races out there are not evil. But we don’t have to make assumptions or do projections. Theory yields to data. The facts are the findings which the behavioral science professionals have obtained researching with experiencers who have interacted with the Star Visitors and learned from what they have to say and show the experiencers. These findings reveal that there are no races dedicated to evil. The huge preponderance of Star Visitors in contact with Earth are affirmatively benign, benevolent and spiritually advanced. Yes, there are a very few Star Visitors who come by who are detached, scientific, selfserving investigators, who have not volunteered to help Earth. These are here out of curiosity, to see what the local primitive society is like. They are much like a Harvard anthropologist traveling up the Amazon River to the most remote interior, to study Stone Age tribes residing there. But the evidence I and my professional colleagues have found for “evil, mean invaders” is zero. We have yet to hear a credible, properly-researched report that revealed a sadistic criminal Star Visitor. And I have researched well over 400 experiencer cases. Neither have the other such professional behavioral scientists who work in this field, and carefully and professionally interact with witnesses and experiencers. Note carefully that I am not asserting that every civilization in the universe is advanced. Just the ones in contact with Earth. And for our purposes, that's all that matters. Those are the only ones we have to deal with. And these civilizations are benign. In fact, the Star Visitors have informed some of us that the violent, aggressive societies which develop on some planets generally don’t become space-faring. They usually end up blowing themselves up, or blowing themselves back to the Stone Age, and having to start all over. The very few aggressive societies who do manage to enter space generally don’t last long out there. The advanced-civilizations star federations have little patience with such aggression, and effectively confine those societies to their home worlds until they grow up. This is not unlike the space embargo which the Star Visitors imposed on the United
111



States towards the end of the Apollo Moon Program, when the U.S. military started to plan bringing nuclear weapons into space, and using the Moon as the ultimate Forward Military Base. The Visitors made it very clear to NASA et al. that such violence would not be tolerated in space, and to keep it on Earth, or better yet, get rid of it. As a result, after Apollo XVII roared off the pad in December, 1972, there have been no more official manned trips into deep space. Further, these Star Visitors federations maintain a protective cordon around Earth. The Star Visitors are committed to filtering out any rare potential lone rogue operator who might come along and be tempted to mess around with an Earthling. So, now that the facts are laid out, we can avoid operating with Earth-culture horseblinders. To assume that things out there must be like they are in violent, crime-ridden American society, or another such Earth culture, is a heavily-flawed and erroneous assumption. It is time it was laid to rest.
Are Some Star Visitors entitled to borrow samples of human reproductive material?
One of the more hypocritical attacks which the Cabal’s debunker squad try to make on the Star Visitors is that the Visitors are engaged in unethical in-vitro fertilization and genesplicing. This charge is usually made in highly emotional and demagogic fashion, something along the lines of: “Those aliens are stealing our women, violating them by snatching their eggs, and creating halfbreeds for who knows what God-awful purpose!” That the Cabal would attempt to use the rhetoric of women’s rights to create anti-Star Visitor propaganda is beyond chutzpah. After all, it is the Cabal’s MILABS units who regularly kidnap, drug, abuse, terrorize, experiment on, and gang-rape innocent women, and then narcohypnotize them into misremembering the incident as an “alien abduction”. The truth needs to be carefully parsed, to sort it out from the overwhelming amounts of propagandistic distortions floating around at UFO conferences and many media “documentaries”. For example, in Leslie Bohem’s and Steven Spielberg’s Taken TV series., the conclusion is presented that the Zetas lack certain emotional properties because of their evolutionary trajectory, and this is why they need to crossbreed themselves with us. This element is interlarded with highly emotionally-charged scenes of people screaming outrageously as they are taken out of their bedroom by Star Visitors. Experiencers are misportrayed as permanently emotionally traumatized by their encounter. Such demagogic melodrama does serious violence to the truth. First, the lurid scenes in Taken both stereotype and mis-portray all encounters as only having to do with reproductive material. Such a false picture is a disservice to the truth. Most encounters, on the order of over 95%, have nothing to do with reproductive material. And only one culture among all the visiting Star Nations engages in any work with reproductive material at all. There is one race group within the general Zeta Reticulan mega-civilizations who state that they have in the past bioengineered undesirable psychoemotional traits (e.g., aggression, hate, envy) out of their genome, as a way of promoting a more civilized society. (The television
112



fictional character Mr. Spock is an approximate analog of their emotional repertoire.) This race group is characterized by three long fingered hands with cartiliginous supportive structure, large slanted almond dark eyes, large craniums sloped up from front toward the back, thin, light-grayish white skin, and generally of approximately 3-1/2 foot stature, with group leaders who are somewhat taller.. However, the rest of the other groups of similar appearance have maintained a robust emotional range, and thus are capable of, among other things, tremendous outpourings of love. (While many people lump all Star Visitor groups resembling this description into one class, “Zeta Reticulans” or “Greys”, it should be noted that a number of races exist with variations of such features: for example, four, five or six-fingered hands, skin hues of alabaster, black, orange, bluish, brown, dark-gray, etc., eyes set horizontally, eyes which wrap around the side of the head, 5-1/2 to 7 or more feet in stature, etc. Thus, any lumping of such diverse races and civilizations together with one label is as inappropriate and unhelpful as saying that “all Asians look alike to me.”) Over millennia, this restricted-emotional-range group within the Zeta civilizations have carried a reengineered genome which has retreated to such a limited range of expressibility, that this group has determined that such a restricted emotional range is interfering with their optimal metaphysical and spiritual development. They desperately wish to remedy this situation. Further, they have experienced an atrophy of reproductive ability, perhaps by manygenerations exposure to cosmic radiation in space, and have had to resort to cloning to produce offspring. Over millennia, the cloned descendants have gradually lost genetic vigor, with the danger that continued cloning would result in sterility and their race dying out. Therefore, they have studied the Star Visitor-Earth primate hybrid known as human, and determined that our blend of Star Visitor-genes with their mental and spiritual capacity and primate-genes with their robust emotionality and genetic vigor is sufficiently useful, that borrowing human genetic material and splicing it into their genome would meet their need for a somewhat broader emotional-range capacity and restored genetic vigor. So this group has proceeded to do precisely that, and has produced hybrid offspring, who are reared aboard their craft. These hybrid children have some human characteristics included in their general overall Star Visitor genome, including an enhanced capacity for expressive love and the need to tangibly feel being loved. This Zeta sub-group is pleased with their genetic-upgrade effort, and is now looking forward to an improved future for their race spiritually and metaphysically, as well as the general survival of their race as a reproducible species. And after all, that is critcally important. The professional debunkers positioned within the UFO community have gone around attempting to stir up anti-Star Visitor feelings by stridently proclaiming that the Star Visitors are not entitled to borrow reproductive and genetic material from humans. These propagandists have cleverly tailored their message to agitate susceptible women, many of whom have histories of unresolved human sexual abuse, and are therefore easily argued and manipulated and angered into viewing their encounter as another “violation”, and thus becoming “anti-alien” messengers. The Cabal agitators then see to it that these “spokespersons” get invited to UFO conferences, are encouraged to call in to media programs discussing the UFO phenomenon, and in general are misperceived by the public as representing the “typical” encounter experience. Such manipulative propagandizing is done by operatives who have been trained in
113



military-warfare psychological operations, who have no conscience, and for whom the truth is an expendable commodity. To attempt to apply principles of medical ethics to off-world cultures is not an easy enterprise, to be sure. But since the anti-Star Visitor agitators have effectively stirred up many with their lies and sophistries, it is appropriate to try to put a factual and balanced ethical perspective on the issue of one Zeta sub-group’s borrowing human genetic material and splicing it into their genome. Any thoughtful answer would have to take into account the fact that this race group are the ones who bioengineered humans from Earth primate stock in the first place, by gene-splicing into a basic Earth primate genome some of their genes for intelligence, larger brain case, dexterity, emotional control, and upright posture, so as to fashion Homo Sapiens Sapiens. Since we are their bioengineering handiwork, it can be argued that they have a right to borrow back some genetic material, since we are the result of genetic material “borrowed” from them. But there is another factor that comes into consideration here in any attempt to morally evaluate another culture’s activity. The Star Visitor group under discussion is like virtually all of the other Star Visitor cultures in this respect: they share the value that the individual’s individual interests are subordinate to the major important interests of their society as a whole. Likewise there is the principle that one society’s less-vital issues of self interest yield to criticallyimportant issues of other neighboring societies, since they are all members of a larger community, and in a community, one member’s less-important interests yield to another member’s issues of vital importance. Thus, in the matter of borrowing a tiny sample of genetic or reproductive material so that a race may regain abilities which are crucial to its metaphysical and spiritual advancement and very genetic survival, (the restricted-emotional-range Zeta sub-group who borrow such genetic material so that they can genetically engineer vital emotional abilities and genetic vigor back into their race), there is no proportion between the slight inconvenience of a limited number of Earthlings versus the metaphysical, spiritual, and genetic salvation of an entire (off-world) race. Given that that race would die out without this genetic repair, there is an issue of moral necessity, which further strengthens the conclusion that our original off-world bioengineers are entitled to borrow a bit back from the human genome which they originally created. Additionally, this group “shares the wealth”. That is to say, in addition to bioengineering some desirable traits from human DNA into their genome, and producing more fully-developed Zeta hybrids, they also upgrade the DNA in the reproductive material of the human experiencers they visit, so that these persons can later go on to be parents of highly advanced children, the Star Kids. The joy and pride such advanced kids bring their parents more than compensates for the momentary inconvenience of the borrowing of reproductive samples. This is not just moral ethical reasoning, but the heartfelt expression I have heard from scores of women experiencers who have had such encounters.
114



Real Encounters vs Fantasy and Fiction
As if the understanding of the low-key encounters between Star Visitors and humans were not made difficult enough by the obscurantist denials and debunking of government spokespersons, and the propagandistic distortions of the Cabal’s operatives, there are additional challenges. One such challenge is the people who make up a story about a supposed Star Visitor encounter. Often such people try to compensate for lives which seem boring or lacking in purpose by creating some fancy tale about their “alien abduction”. Such tales are generally easily detected by a research professional expert, bcause the story line varies in telling ways from the kinds of interactions Star Visitors are known to engage in. Very often these made-up tales borrow their story-line from sensationalistic television documentaries, which themselves get the fact wrong as often as not. Are such made-up encounters harmless “tall tales”? Not really. Given the monumental importance of Star Visitor contacts with Earth’s cultures, we do not need erroneous impressions muddying up the picture. And the self-importance and overdramatization which fakers bring to the public’s attempt to understand what is going on is a disservice and an insult to the brave and admirable real experiencers who dare to step forward and share their genuine encounters amidst the current prevailing climate of skepticism and scorn. What about mentally-ill people reporting encounters? It is an interesting, indeed fascinating aspect of this phenomenon that behavioral-science professionals who research this field find a surprisingly small number of reports generated as a result of mental illness. I have worked with over 400 experiencers, and I would estimate that fewer than 5% of reports are generated as a result of mental illness. Other behavioral scientists I talk to have the same findings. Thus, the common debunker strategy of trying to characterize all people who report encounters with UFOs and Star Visitors as “nut cases” is clearly completely at variance with the actual facts.
Real Encounters vs MILABS
There are enough persons now who are aware that unpleasant encounters are most likely the handiwork of rogue military-intelligence psychological-operations units that the question has come up: “How do you tell whether your encounter was with genuine Star Visitors or was a MILABS operation?” Again, “MILABS” indicates a kidnapping by a rogue mil-intel unit which involves assaulting, drugging, ruthless interrogating, sometimes gang-raping, and usually narcohypnotizing the victim to misremember her or his ordeal as an "alien abduction". Well, the short answer to the question is that the real Star Visitors don't do the above misbehaviors associated with mil-intel kidnap-assaults. Star Visitor encounters are noted by high cultural and metaphysical purpose. Often, after getting over the initial shock of meeting a person from another star system, the human visited misses the Star Visitor(s), and anticipates with
115



pleasure and awe their return. No one wishes for another MILABS! Mil-Intel kidnap assaults are noted for leaving the victim terrorized, fearful of (pseudo)"aliens", traumatized, abused and drugged, as well as having the residue of a rape experience. Another way to distinguish an encounter is by the use of regressive hypnosis by a skilled hypnotherapist professional. This will remove the memory block, and reveal who were the individuals that the person was actually dealing with. Also, we should not lose sight of the fact that these military-intelligence kidnappings are illegal. During the Clinton Administration, Health & Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala held hearings in 1995, and gathered testimony on victims of government mistreatment, including radioactivity experiments. A number of MILABS victims also reported their abuse during this process, and their testimony was gathered and recorded. Apparently, the Clinton Administration was appalled by what they heard at these Hearings. President Clinton subsequently apologized to the group of victims for unethical government experimentation, but did not make specific reference to the MILABS victims. (President Clinton had made various attempts during his administration to find out the full facts about what the government knows about UFOs and Star Visitors, but discovered that he was shut out of the information loop. Apparently the civilianmilitary-contractor cartel who run the UFO Cover-Up deemed that he did not have a “need to know”.) There is no evidence that the Bush Administration has any effective procedure for processing MILABS complaints. And Vice-President Cheney has renaged on his pre-election promise to tell what he knows about UFOs once he got into the White House. Indeed, he tartly answered one questioner at a public meeting that if he did know anything about UFOs, that it would be properly classified, and thus he would not be free to talk about it.
What Do the Star Visitors Have To Say?
People ask me, if the Star Visitors are indeed in communication with humans, what do you believe is the message the Star people are trying to give us? The Star Visitors have several principal themes in their messages to humankind, in addition to personal messages for the individual involved in the encounter. Of the general messages four themes predominate. First, the Star Visitors are highly concerned about mankind's destruction of Earth's ecosystems. They warn that we need to reverse this environmentally-destructive trend before it is too late. And it is getting late. Second, they strongly urge us to get rid of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction as unfit for civilized society. They are appalled by the military's attempts to shoot down their craft. They advise that we need to get rid of our violent and aggressive ways; that we will not be allowed into deep space until we do. Third, they wish us to know that they come in peace and seek respectful contact. They wish us to know that we are not the only intelligent life in the universe. They come as fellow intelligent life, and want us to know that we are not all alone in the cosmos.
116



Fourth, they come with an invitation. The invitation is this: that after we adopt peaceable ways, to come out into space and join the community of intelligent societies from various star systems. There is a lot of disinformation floating around the Internet and in UFO magazines about “what those aliens are really up to.” One hoary such false tale purports that the Star Visitors offered to give the U.S. Government advanced weapons technology in exchange for permission to take Americans aboard their craft for experimentation. This is patent nonsense. The Number Two message theme from the Star Visitors is for humans to give up our violent and warring ways. Why would the Star Visitors improve our weapons capabilities? The tale is vicious propaganda, "flipping" the Shadow Government's misuse and weaponizing of captured Star Visitor technology from downed craft, and then blaming the Star Visitors for misguided humans' twisting of such technology to weapons purposes.
Bonding Between Human Experiencers And Star Visitors
The question can be raised as to the often-reported deep bonding that occurs between contactees and the Star Visitors: the emotional and spiritual interconnectedness and feeling of completeness between the human and the Visitor. Are we in need of each other? Can it be that humans may complete the Star Visitors in some way? If that is the case, then how and why? There are many Star Visitor civilizations in contact with Earth. My research estimate is over 100 such civilizations. Given the variety of cultures, there will be differences in the way a given race interacts with persons of Earth. That said, it is the general experience of genuine experiencers that they feel almostoverwhelming love and personal interest from their Star Visitor contact. This love is fueled by the Star Visitors’ advanced spiritual and metaphysical development, and by their recognition of humans as a fellow intelligent species, who are thus deserving of respect and love. As to the question of whether humans are needed to “complete” the Star Visitors, such “completion” is not intrinsically necessary, but rather the kind of personal growth experience that, for example, an anthropologist-explorer would have in meeting and engaging with and learning from a more primitive but charming tribe in a jungle interior whose culture has its own gems of expressing life. But it gets more layered than just the simple answers above. In not a few cases, the encounter between the human and the Star Visitor is a sort of family reunion. This is because in a good number of instances, the human being visited is currently a person who in a previous incarnation was a Star Visitor, and lived on another world. In many encounters the Star Visitor tries to remind the human of his/her previous existence, and that the human is cherished family who has not been forgotten. More than one experiencer has told me that during an encounter, the Star Visitors quizzically or plaintively, “Don’t you remember us?”

Chapter 9
What Is It Like To Be A Star Kid?
Some Star Kids are aware of their advanced abilities, and use them from the earliest time in their life. Katrina is one such Star Kid. She was one of those Star Kids whom I call EarlyBloomers.
Katrina grew up in a psychically-permissive home. Her mother, Dottie, practiced daily meditation, and frequently channeled several entities, including the Hindu demi-god, Ganesha. From a very early age Katrina felt attracted to the practice of meditation. She did so on an almost daily basis. As young Katrina slipped from beta state (ordinary wakefulness) into theta state (deep altered consciousness), sometimes she would begin to slip out of her body. At the same time her body experienced a pronounced sense of lightness, and Katrina felt like she was floating. After a few more moments, her body was floating ever so gently off the floor, first a quarter-inch, then a half-inch. Then, as Katrina persisted in theta-state meditation, her body rose to an inch above the floor, then more, until she was floating a good four inches above the floor. As Katrina’s meditation came to an end, she started to come back more fully into her body. As she did so, her body became more engaged with the environment, including the ambient gravitational pull. Gradually her body lowered until she was resting once more in a cross-legged position on the floor. One day, when Katrina as deep in meditation and floating slightly above the floor, her dog came galloping in and began licking her face. Her concentration broken, Katrina dropped suddenly to the floor. It was at this point that she realized that she had been previously floating during her meditation. Because Katrina lived in a psychically-aware and accepting household, she did not feel strange about her ability to levitate. Indeed she had been taught by her parents that such a gift comes often enough with persevering metaphysical and spiritual self-development. With other Star Kids, it is only gradually and falteringly that they become aware of first one, then another special power. These are the Star Kids whom I call Later Developers. Their awareness of who they are and the advanced abilities comes only later, perhaps in adolescence, or even in adult life. Often in the early stages of self-discovery, the special ability happens suddenly and spontaneously without warning. The Star Kid feels that he or she has no control over the power it just happens, seemingly on its own. It is only over time that the child learns that he or she has some effect on how the power operates. With practice and repetition over time, the Star Kid learns to master the ability, taking it as far as the child’s interest, self-discipline and inherent giftedness will allow the power to unfold. Jacob is a radiant 12-year-old with cascading curls of golden hair, who looks like an altar boy out of Central Casting. Ever since he was five, (that is, as far back as he can remember), he noticed that he could see shimmering, slightly-luminous field s around people. He found this ability intriguing, but was unsure what to do with it. Jacob’s father, who did not feel himself to
118



be anyone special, maintained an open mind when Jim confided in him that he could see these luminous fields. But Jacob’s father did not have a background in the metaphysical or psychic arts. Thus, he was not in a position to be particularly helpful to Jacob in understanding his abilities further and developing them. But Jacob’s father did keep an open mind about the auraviewing, along with a few other advanced powers which Jacob gradually confided to his father that he had noticed about himself. Meanwhile, Jacob did a lot of reading about the metaphysical arts on his own, trying to get a better handle on what it was that he was dealing with. When Jacob’s father saw an announcement for a Star Kids Workshop©, he knew that he had to take Jacob to the Workshop, so that Jacob could get a better understanding of himself and his gifts. At the Workshop Jacob sought out an individual consultation on psychic gifts. It was during the requested consultation that I taught him about seeing and reading auras, as well as all the other Star Kid abilities which he might also have. Jim also learned some psychic exercises that he could do to get better mastery over his gifts. He also learned some applications of these powers for the good of other people. Still other Star Kids are what I call the “Latents”. These may be totally unaware that they have such abilities until the end of childhood, or even into adulthood or middle age. A special sub-group of these Latent Star Kids are quietly aware that they are “weird”, and have powers that people would not consider “normal”, but these young people find it more convenient and less embarassing to remain in denial of their special gifts. They do not want to have to deal with the challenges, the discomfort, the hassles that current Fourth World society dishes out to those whom it deems “strange”. These Latent Star Kids find it just easier to ignore those intermittent spontaneous break-throughs of special ability that happen to them, and to try to act like everyone else is supposed to act. Fiona is an example of a Latent Star Kid who did not “wake up” until she was well into her adult years. Fiona is now in her middle 40s. During her earlier adulthood she had noticed from time o time a few “odd” things about herself. She sometimes would have a rather vivid dream about some dramatic incident, such as a friend involved in an auto accident, or a cousin struck with a serious illness. Later, that very incident actually occurred, and very much like in the “Dream”. She also noticed that she seemed to have an extraordinary “green thumb” about plants. So much so that even her friends would bring her their dying plants, and Fiona would soon bring them back to vibrant health. Her special skills included pouring love into the plant, placing her hand over it or lightly touching it and sending vital energy feelings into the plant. Yet Fiona brushed off these things as “coincidences” or “good luck”. She never basically thought of herself as different than other people. Then one day, Fiona’s friend showed her the Star Kid/Star Seed Identification Questionnaire© and said that she should take it, because one of the items in here sounded like her. Fiona did take it, and was astounded at her score. She took it again just to be sure her score was correct. It was a 28, and meant that she most certainly was a Star Seed. Further, she came to realize that since she had been having precognitive “Dreams”, and been having a extraordinary “green thumb” since childhood, she saw that she had been a Star Kid back then as well. Fiona was thunderstruck. It was as though the Biblical “scales” had fallen from her eyes. In a brief moment she was forced to reevaluate her earlier life and who she was. She didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry, so filled was she with emotion. She was a Star Seed! (And no longer a Latent Star Seed.)
119



That very day she emailed me to get more information about the Star Kid/Star Seed phenomenon. She assured me that she would be participating in the next Star Kid/Star Seed Workshop© to learn more about herself and the deeper world she now found herself in. Alright, we have looked at several Star Kids, and seen the differences between Star Kids with awareness of who they are from early on, the Early Bloomers; and the Star Kids who wake up to their abilities and identity later in childhood, or even in adulthood, the Later Developers; and the Star Kids of whatever age who walk around “asleep” as to their real identity, the Latents. But what’s it like to be a Star Kid? What does a Star Kid’s daily life look like? How does it go? Imagine yourself to be a Star Kid. That’s not too difficult if you are one. It’s a bit more of a stretch, but still somehow strangely familiar, if you are a Latent Star Kid or adult Star Seed. And if you are not a Star Kid at all, well, follow along and let’s go through a day in the life of a Star Kid. Let’s say hat you are Abigail (Abby) Jones, 11, and a sixth grader at Porter Valley Middle School. You live in a single-parent, working-class household with your mother, brother, little sister and two cats. You wake up at 6:30 on a school morning. As you rub the sleep from your eyes, you remember a “Dream” you had during the night that woke you up a little after midnight, because it was so intense. In the “Dream” a handsome male figure in a flowing robe stood in front of you and told you that you were about to meet a new boy. You would recognize him because he was quite tall for sixth grade, was good-looking, had dark hair, high cheekbones, a hooked nose, and a dark-red birthmark the size of a quarter right below his left ear. His name would be Erik. The figure in white said that you should pay close attention to Erik, and try to get to know him. He is special. Furthermore, one day he would be your husband. You tuck the “Dream” away in a corner of your mind that you reserve for things that will need further attention later, and shower, dress, and go downstairs for breakfast. Your brother, who is only one year younger than you, has a smaller-than-usual aura around his head and shoulders. He coughs frequently and complains about getting too chilled yesterday swimming laps at the park pool to try to get into shape to make his school’s swim team. You give him a hug and quietly send him some healing energy. Your younger sister, Cecily, 7, is playing with the cats, who are under the kitchen table. One of the cats jumps up on the kitchen table, making a bee-line for a bowl of cereal overbrimming with milk. Cecily shoots the cat a look, and you can hear in your head the silent rebuke that Cecily is mentally telepathing to the cat. The cat stops, turns around, and looks at Cecily, studying whether she really means it. You can hear in your head Cecily’s follow-up thought message to the cat, “Yes, I mean it. Buffy, no milk! Get down off the table now!” The cat studies your younger sister a bit longer, and then slowly, reluctantly pads to the edge of the table and jumps down. You finish breakfast, kiss your mother good-bye, and walk to the street corner to wait with the other kids for the school bus. Your best friend, Tracey is there, sporting heavier-thanusual eye shadow and make-up. You get an instant feeling-intuition-impression that all is not well. Looking at her face you notice a little discoloration under her left eye, almost but not quite hidden by the extra make-up. A picture suddenly lashes into your mind of Tracey’s father slapping her so hard in the face that it knocks her down. “Oh, no!” you find yourself blurting out, “Tracey, is your dad back hitting you again?” Tracey’s head hangs down, and you see a tear
120



sliding down and smudging her make-up a little. “Abby,” she starts, then breaks down crying. You place your arm around her and squeeze her, pouring in every last ounce of protective white light and pearlescent-golden healing energy you can muster. The bus comes and whisks you and the other kids off to school. First Period is Social Studies, and Mr. Shankar, the teacher, has announced a quiz. You haven’t really studied for the quiz, because frankly you find the Civil War rather boring and stupid. But as you do the quiz, you find the answers coming to you despite not having really studied. You finish the quiz, set down your pencil, and wait for the rest of the kids to finish. Meanwhile, you notice that there’s a new boy sitting in the back of the classroom. He is tall, nice-enough looking, almost a hunk, with dark hair, a nose with a bit of a beak to it, and whoa! Now you notice his aura. You really have hardly seen an aura that big in a kid before. Mr. Shankar pipes up: “Times up! Pencils down!” You make a mental note to check out this new boy at recess. Mr. Shankar clears his throat and says, “Class, today we have a new student who has transferred here from Albany, New York. Class, I’d like you to meet Erik Granger.” Erik stands up and waves shyly. As he turns to face the students in one corner of the classroom, you notice a dark red birthmark below his left ear. Your jaw drops, and the quiz sheet falls from your hand. “Abby,” Mr. Shankar’s voice slowly penetrates your state of shock, “you dropped your quiz. Pick it up....Abby, did you hear me?” You can hardly wait for the lunch break. Trying to be nonchalant, you take your cafeteria tray over to the table where Erik is sitting by himself. You set down your tray not too close to his and sit. “Hi,” you find yourself blurting out, “my name is Abby. You must be Erik.” A few pleasantries are exchanged, and you answer a few questions Erik has about how things go at this new school. You’re telling him how Porter Valley Middle School isn’t really bad, when you notice that Erik is staring at you intently. It’s not like the stare you get from so many middle school boys – impudent superiority, or checking out your boobs. Erik is staring at you transfixedly, almost through you. Finally he breaks his reverie, clears his throat nervously, and says, “You know what, Abby? You look kind of familiar. In fact, you look like someone I had a dream about last night.” PE class was really a work-out. You do okay in soccer, and certainly did work up a sweat. In the gym dressing room, you happen to notice the other girls’ bodies. You are the tallest in your grade. You’ve got a pretty womanly figure, and while you don’t know it yet, your ample breasts are already their full adult size. As you look around, you notice the different energies coming off the various girls. Some you feel a strong affinity with, even some few that you don’t know very well. From the little bit that you’ve been reading about Star Kids, you feel that these girls may also be Star Kids. Other girls in the dressing room feel, well, just ordinary. They’re alright as persons, but there is no special energy coming off them. Then you notice Diana, a short, stocky girl with dishwater blonde hair. When she is dressed she wears Goth garb, but now that she’s naked in the shower, you notice that she has an anarchist symbol tattooed on her left shoulder, and a Satanic goat’s head tattooed on her right buttock. You can feel the dark energy pouring off her, which makes you shudder inside. As you’re appraising her, she suddenly looks up, like she could feel you looking at her from behind. She shoots you a dark hateful stare. You instinctively break gaze, and internally you throw up extra shielding of white protective light against this one, who has lost her way. Afternoon Science class is a hoot! Mrs. Harney has decided to spice up the learning section on gasses by having everyone gather around a sodium vapor lamp, that works by
121



electrical excitation of the vapor into a plasma, causing the resultant glowing gas field to emit a intense orangish light. Mrs. Harney is explaining all this, and then dramatically flicks on the switch and the lamp stutters and then quickly flares up into a powerful glow. Your best friend Tracey is standing next to you, and you look each other in the eye and grin, as the same inspiration comes into both of your minds at the same time. Tracey, despite bing an abused kid, is also a Star Kid. She and you have noticed previously that sometimes street lights go out when you two walked under them. Tracey gives you a mischievous wink, and you nod in agreement. Then you both stare intently at Mrs. Harney’s proudly glowing sodium vapor lamp. Suddenly, without warning, the lamp winks out. Mrs. Harney frantically flips the switch on and off repeatedly, but to no avail. The sodium vapor lamp refuses to re-light. Tracey breaks out into a giggle, and Mrs. Harney turns to her. “Tracey, that is not funny. It’s not nice to laugh about an accident.” Then Mrs. Harney turns to the class and explains, “It must be a blown fuse or something.” It is all you can do not to join Tracey in her mischievous giggle. After school, you’re standing at the bus stop waiting for the bus home. Erik walks up and asks if he can walk you home and get a little better acquainted. You demur, explaining how it is too far to walk home, and besides, your mother would be very upset if you showed up at home with a boy you just met. And how your mother says you’re too young to be dating. Erik smiles pleasantly and says that he understands. Besides, he notes, walking a girl home isn’t really a date. “And I don’t know you well enough for a date, yet,” he adds. When you hear the “yet”, a chill and shiver of excitement run up your spine. The evening news is on the television, as your mother prepares dinner. You notice a news story about some anniversary of the first atomic bomb coming up. You find yourself blurting out, “It won’t be the last one either,” without really knowing where that came from. Your brother shoots you a quizzical look. You shrug. Your little sister Cicely runs into the kitchen and tells your mother, “Mom! Abby says there’s going to be another nuclear war.” Your mother dries her hands on her apron, hugs Cicely, and says, “I know, Cicely, I know.” You get a start at your mother’s response, and make a mental note to talk to her later about how she knew. Dinner is a vegetable ratatouille, salad, and homemade whole wheat bread. Your younger sister Cicely is not yet fully integrated into the vegetarian diet your mother provides and wonders out loud why she can’t have hot dogs once in a while like the other kids she knows. You notice that the ratatouille could use a bit more salt, so you face your brother and send that thought in his direction. He absentmindedly passes you the salt-shaker without missing a chew in his dinner. No one seems to notice that this transaction took place without a spoken word being said. That night, after your brother and sister are in bed, you slip into your mother’s room and ask her how she knows that there is going to be another atomic bomb go off. Your mother sits up in bed, pats the bed for you to sit down near her, and looks you straight in the eye. “Abby, you are my oldest and most special, gifted child. I’ve watched you growing up, and seen the things that you can do and your special knowing. I can’t take credit for the wonderful girl you are, but let me say this: I’ve been down the same road. I don’t talk about it a lot, but some of the things you do, I do, too.” She kisses you and sends you to bed. You lie there in your own bed, not quite able to sleep yet. It has been a rather exciting day. You say a prayer to Spirit that Tracey’s dad finds a way to manage his anger and stop taking it out on her. You find yourself thinking about that class witch, Diana, and surround her with the clear light of being able to see the true nature of things. You think about the new boy, Erik, and
122



what he said at the bus stop. Will the future bring dates with Erik? Will it turn out the way the white-robed figure predicted? Will Erik and you go steady, even eventually get married? And if you do, will you have a baby? What kind of a baby will he or she be? Will the child be a Star Kid? Silly girl! Of course the child will be a Star Kid! Wow! That Erik sure has an intense aura. He really gives off powerful energy. And mom says that she can really feel my energy more intensely than the other children’s. What if Erik and I put our awesome energies together? What kind of Star Child would our baby be? Why did that special messenger come to me in a “dream”? What did Erik mean that he had a dream about me last night? Did he have a visit from the same white-robed messenger? Where did that messenger come from? And how did he know that I would meet Erik? So many questions. As you drift off to sleep, you find yourself hoping that some answers will come to you during the night.

Chapter 10
Are Star Kids Normal?
Many small children around the world are aware of the wonderful and delightful world of fantasy “pocket monsters”, those not-very-scary animal-baby versions of dinosaurs, animal hybrids and fictional creatures. Japanese genius has brought to small children a dizzying array of numerous such Pokemon, whether as colorful, elegantly-printed trading cards, or as the television series or movies. It is of interest, and perhaps not coincidental, that the ingenious Japanese creators of Pokemon have included in their set of creatures some who are endowed with psychic powers. Were the Pokemon creators inspired by Star Kids they met in deciding to include among their creatures some who are gifted with paranormal powers? At any rate, whether consciously or unconsciously, the many young Star Kids who play the Pokemon games with their assorted creature cards can identify with one or other of these psychically-endowed Pokemon: - Abra is a telepathic mind-reader, and is also able to teleport himself; - Kadabra is able to project brain waves so as to give opponents headaches; [parenthetically, I’ve done this myself to cause certain rogue Cabal psi operatives to back off when they were sending negative energy waves my way]; - Alakazam has an IQ of “5000". This is a bit more than any Star Kid (or adult Star Seed for that matter) would have. But given the unbelievable downloads of information, concepts and awarenesses which many Star Kids, experiencers, and adult Star Seeds have received from the Star Visitors, (often during nocturnal encounters), and given that 5000 is only about 16 times as bright as the brightest humans alive, it is entirely possible that some of the Star Visitors operate with an individual (or shared-group) intelligence/consciousness equivalent to a human IQ of 5000. - Drowzee has the ability to hypnotically induce sleep. He is also a “dream eater”, (although my informant grandson did not spell out for me what exactly this ability entailed); - Hypno is a Pokemon who also has the ability to induce sleep through hypnosis; - Mewtwo has, in the world of Pokemon, gone to the Dark Side, since even in the cherubic world of Pokemon, there is a Dark Side. Thus, his powers are adversarial. He can set psychic barriers against others’ powers. He can psychically create mists, and he can induce amnesia in an opponent. Children who see themselves as too old for Pokemon games have another fantasy card game and movie world, Yu-Gi-Oh!, which is also populated with fantasy creatures, some of whom also have psychic powers. Grown-ups have their own cinematic fantasy worlds whose heroes and villains are endowed with remarkable paranormal powers. The three Matrix movies, the two X-Men movies, and the several Harry Potter books and movies seem like Hollywood-ized versions of the somewhat quieter and less extreme lives of many Star Kids and adult Star Seeds. There are now emerging even physical-action games whose success at the more advanced
124



levels relies on the child’s using psychic powers. I have had the good fortune to meet Alysn Hassenforder and her partner Paul Russel of Glenwood Springs, Colorado. They operate the Dragon’s Lair kids store there. They have developed “DragonSport©”, a game of skill based on the ancient martial art, Jojutsu. DragonSport involves the child player wielding an electronic light sabre which must touch one of three pylons arrayed in a triangle. When one of the pylons lights up, (at erratic intervals), the player must strike it with her light sabre before the very-short times-up button sounds. The contestant stands in the middle of the three pylons, and, as her skill builds, the pace and tempo of the game quicken. Alysn tells me that the best players, whom she is sure are Star Kids, play the game blindfolded! And these operate at the quickest tempo. Like Jedi apprentices, they soon are masterful, using only an inner “sight” and extraordinarily-quick reflexes. To properly ask the question as to whether Star Kids are normal, one has also to reflect on the fact that through books, games and movies, today’s contemporary world is slowly closing the cultural gap between the conventional world, assumed and taught in schools, and the paranormal world of Star Kids. True, the gap-closing books, games and movies are labeled “fiction” and “fantasy”. But the wild success of this genre does not so much, in my view, bespeak a massive epidemic of flight from reality on the part of the public, as rather a combination of the public’s subconscious recognition of Star Kids’ (and Star Seeds’) abilities abounding among us, and of the plentiful Star Kids’ eager identification with heroes who are like themselves. Today’s Harry Potters and Hermione Grangers do not wear sorcerer robes and pointed hats, but their abilities are often as varied as J.K. Rowland’s characters. And many a teenage Star Kid has identified with the Matrix central character, Neo’s gradual path of self-discovery. And such Star Teens, either through trial and error, or by becoming aware of the Star Kids Project information, come to own and accept themselves as “The One” who operates outside the illusions and deceptions of Fourth World society, and whose mission is to liberate others to break free and help create Fifth World Star Kid/Star Seed society. Many of the Star Kids and their parents, who clamor for me to find the resources to open a Star Kids School in their area, relate to the uncanny X-Men: 2 movie, and its wonderful School for Gifted Youngster headed by Professor Charles Xavier. Talk about Art (the movie) imitating Life (the Star Kids phenomenon)! As these advanced children are allowed to come out of the closet, and use their gifts in the course of ordinary daily life, this will be a substantial part of the fashioning of the Fifth World society predicted in indigenous prophecies. As the Native American Grandmother Elders proclaimed in 1997, the Fifth World has begun. But its full realization will become manifest over time; and will be clearly evident by 2012. The Transition between Fourth World old culture and Fifth World Star Seed culture will not be knife-edge sharp and sudden. Instead, it is a gradual but quickening-paced 15-year transition. Fourth World will not go out with a bang, and perhaps not even with a whimper. Rather, Fourth World will cease to exist because there will be too few to uphold and operate within its obsolescent assumptions and structures. And Fifth World will not come as a result of the simultaneous mass landings of 100,000 star craft in population centers all over the world. Instead, Fifth World culture and society are
125



already forming. Its roots are already underfoot. Its citizens are already quietly dispersed in multitudinous numbers among society. Its culture is not only already being introduced through “fantasy” and “fiction” books, games, TV shows and movies, but being increasingly supported by discoveries in science, medicine and psychology, which, for example, show that consciousness can influence matter, that psychic powers can be measured (and thus are scientifically real), and that focused attention on healing can produce statistically significant improvement in a patient’s healing state. As the current Fourth World society catches up with dawning Fifth World reality, Fourth World will experience a soft implosion. And the resultant vacuum will be filled by the richness of Fifth World life, love, culture and its interdependent, transparent society of citizen-savants. Fourth World will not go away by violent revolution. No, it will evaporate because there will be no one left to salute it. This is not to suggest that the transition will occur without a struggle. The current, apparently-omnipotent, geo-plutocratic Cabal have in place an elaborate set of interlocking structures which depend on, and perpetuate, Fourth World assumptions and folkways. In Chapter Fifteen we will examine further this Cabal and its influence. The transition will be bitterly fought against by the Cabal. Indeed, much resistance is already going on, and the Transition will generate many casualties. Yet the Transition will occur, indeed is inevitable, because in latent form, amidst hundreds of millions of Star Kids quietly living among us, it is already here. Let’s look at this world-in-transition from the perspective of the Star Kids. If Star Kids know that they are somehow different, can they tell if another child is a Star Kid? What does one first notice about a Star Kid that would tell you that you are in the presence of a Star Kid? Are Star Kids normal? These are fair questions. Let’s start with the first question: “If Star Kids know that they are somehow different, can they tell if another child is a Star Kid?” Star Kids do pick up on each other often. And adult Star Seeds very often notice when there is a Star Kid present. (Or another adult Star Seed, for that matter.) Let me describe for you a little of my own experience in this realm, for starters. One of the things that early-on got me paying attention to how many Star Kids there are was noticing how these new children would look up when I walked by on the sidewalk, or in the mall, or in a fast food restaurant. Babies looking back over their mother’s shoulder would be gazing generally, then suddenly focus on me and brighten up, some with a shy smile, others looking somewhat fascinated. The same things kept happening with wee ones in strollers, and young toddlers learning to walk. It was like I was the most riveting thing they had seen. Now, I remember how children that age decades ago would operate in an unfocused or easily distracted manner, quickly moving from one stimulus to another. But so many of the children of these last few years are so different! They come in aware. While the babes of yore lolled their head,s and had a poorly-focused gaze, most of today’s children are alert, focused, carefully tracking the environment around them. They even have a different appearance than the babies of a couple decades ago. So many of these children look intelligent, are calmly evaluating what is going on, are curious, and maintain an almost grown-up gaze. When they look at you, if
126



they have decided you are of interest, they study you with a wise look and a highly-focused lock-on gaze that makes you feel like you are being studied by a peer. When I first noticed this new wave of exceptional young children, at first I was quite fascinated by their mature scanning of the area around them, their poise, their self-possession and outgoingness. As a Star Seed, I could not help but notice how often that, when I entered a room, how quickly the Star Kids would swivel their heads towards me and stare. After I got past my initial bewilderment, I decided to become interactive with these children. At first I would just engage them back by waving back at them with a small inconspicuous salute, consisting of two fingers bent forward and wiggled like rabbit ears. The kids seem to like this almost-secret playful acknowledgment of them. Almost to a person, these Star Kids would smile, or furtively wave back. I’ve given a lot of thought to what it is precisely that they notice about me that turns their heads. At first I thought it was that they were seeing the pumped-up aura (bio-electromagneticphotic field) that extends a substantial ways out from a Star Seed. ( For further details see: http://www.drboylan.com/bioelctrcfields.html) And that may very well be true. But it does not explain the children who are facing the other way, and who then turn around when I enter a room. Thus, I have more recently developed an additional hypothesis. What I now think is actually going on is that these little Star Kids are extremely sensitive to, and pick up on, that is to say, are feeling the bio-electromagnetic-photic field which extends in a wide radius out from me. On a good day, this field may extend almost fifty feet. I think it is my field bumping up against them or their field, which causes them to sense the presence of a Star Seed even when they are facing the other way. But it is more than just the Star Kids vaguely sensing the quasi-tingle of an electrical field, or the cellular-level sensing of the vague tug of a magnetic field nearby. The special field of Star Kids and adult Star seeds has an emotional feeling, as well as its electrical, magnetic and light properties. The emotional feeling these fields have is one of gentle warmth, peace, lovingness, and special aliveness. And it feels really good to be within the radius of such a nice, gentle pleasant field. When a child is going along in their day, and bumps into such a Star Seed field, it kind of wakes them up in a pleasant way. They suddenly get this feeling of “pleasant presence”, and so turn around to see who it is that has approached and is sending out those kinds of vibes. Not that all of this is a conscious process; it often happens almost instinctually. And thus, this field-touching and sensitivity to Star Kid fields constitute one more “signature” by which Star Kids can recognize another Star Kid, (or Star Seed adult.) I have discussed this phenomenon with other adult Star Seeds. Many of them have begun to notice similar things in their own experience. I have long had a saying, which I first adopted in my working with experiencers of Star Visitor contact. One Star Kid (or Star Seed adult) can tell if there is another Star Kid (or Star Seed) across a crowded room. This is generally the case, if the Star Kid is paying attention. But, this is not quite universal, however. For, further experience has convinced me of two things. First, not all Star Kids (or Star Seed adults) are ready to own their special identity, though the majority are. Some Star Kids have used free will to turn their back on the whole
127



phenomenon, to deny it, (though they know it to be true), and decide tactically to “play normal”. Many of these are very emotionally-sensitive children, who are shy, resent being the focus of attention, and/or are having a difficult enough time adjusting to this planet without further challenges. Or they are children who have been called names, or labeled crazy, or called a witch, or “possessed by Satan”, for having their advanced abilities. Or they are teens who are wrestling with issues of establishing their own identity, and feel that they do not need the extra struggle. At this point in society’s evolution, the pay-off for “playing normal” is ever so much greater than for acknowledging that you are a Star Kid. And the scorn, ostracization, and career/social life damage that can come from being publicly “out” as a Star Kid can be a heavy price, indeed. And one which some Star Kids choose not to pay. These are not the Latent Star Kids. These are the Underground Star Kids. And because they are so busy playing “normal”, they tune out, and thus miss, the subtle but real psychic signals that they could pick up if they were just tuned in. Secondly, because not all Star Kids are attuned enough to intuit, or feel the personality of a fellow Star Kid across a crowded room, what turns out to be the case is that what many Star Kids pick up on in a fellow Star Kid is their “sensing” the energetic field which a Star Kid will emit out to a fair distance around them. These Star Kids will kind of notice the field, maybe even get turned on by the person emitting the field, if it is someone of appropriate age and gender, without actually specifically putting their finger on why that other person is so magnetic. What exactly is the feeling of the other Star Kid’s (or adult Star Seed’s), energy field? I feel like I’m really at a loss to do a totally adequate job of describing it. The field is multi-faceted and subtle. Let me try to describe it through a variety of impressions. Often the field is accompanied by other energetic signals which enhance and diversify the energy being sent out. Sometimes these additional signals manifest as a special glow in the Star Kid’s eyes. Not an artificial light, like in monster movies. Rather a gentle but vibrant extra glow beyond the “glow of health” some people talk about in people’s eyes. Again, the field can manifest as a warm feeling aura that surrounds a Star Kid, which can be felt when you are close to them. The feeling is open, kind, friendly, quietly electric. The field can also be noticed as an almost-adult, but still charmingly child-like simplicity that a Star Kid exudes, and which hints at the well-developed wisdom within. These Star Kids have an intensity, an energy, a depth of feeling in their face and eyes which mark them as special. This is also the same energy-frequency that creates an instant sense of familiarity and similarity when Star Kids get together even for the first time. They get instantly the kind of feeling you normally get in an already-developed friendship: a feeling of confident familiarity, trust, a quick liking of the other Star Kid, and a sureness that you will be understood and liked in return. Such an energy field like this helps communicate that there is an assumed trove of common assumptions, values and understandings. It speeds the connection and bonding between Star Kids and Star Seeds of every age. And the energy around a Star Kid is not just a voltage thing; their energy has consciousness. Indeed, the Star Kid’s energy field is another extension, even another dimension, of their consciousness field. The Star Kid’s energy field is both actively and passively sentient. That is why one Star Kid can feel it when another Star Kid comes into the room, even when their back is turned or they are not looking up. The Star Kid just knows that someone is there, and not just any person, but a kid with that “energy signature” that marks another Star Kid.
128



And the awareness is mutual. Both Star Kids feel an instinctive attraction that invites them to approach each other, or at least feel secure in the knowledge that there is another “friendly” in the room. When one Star Kid meets another, each can raise such topics as Star Visitor contacts, psychic abilities, one’s special mission, etc. without the raised eyebrows or changing-the-subject reactions that they get from regular humans. Thus, the Star Kid can let down her guard, and let down her hair, and instinctively know that she will be understood on her own terms, and from her own experience. Dealing with another Star Kid does generate a powerful and confirming sense that “I am not alone,” and that there are other neat special people around. The anticipation of finding a similar friend, or in the older Star Teen, of finding a like soul mate, is part of the powerful attractive force that reaches across a room and pulls one Star Kid towards another. The second question that this chapter opened with asked, “What does one first notice about a Star Kid that would tell you that you are in the presence of a Star Kid?” Even many ordinary humans eventually notice a difference in a Star Kid. It gets noticed even if all they can manage to say is, “There’s something about that kid ....” They are referring to the Star Kid’s special energy, positive intensity, and aliveness. The child is present in a stand-out way. But in a calm strong way, not in a frenetic way. Usually. (After all, Star Kids are still kids.) A second feature that many people notice in a Star Kid, even when they don’t know that he or she is a Star Kid, is charm. The child exudes an attractive appeal. Often the well-formed appearance of the Star Kid adds to the charm, but even in those Star Kids who face the challenges of physical handicap or psychiatric illness, the basic charm is present. A third common feature that people tend to pick up on quickly is that the Star Kid is bright. Often the Star Kid in question is one of the brightest children in their class. But even for those Star Kids who have difficulty with conventional schooling, because of the child’s difficulties in adapting to human neurological wiring, or because the way the child’s nimble mind works differs from standard human thought, logic and problem-solving patterns, the Star Kid’s basic ingenuity, inventiveness, and go-around problem-solving shine through amidst the struggle and misunderstandings. A fourth feature is what I call “presence”. The child, even when they are just standing still, fill the space they are standing in in a very strong fashion. They almost command the situation, even without opening their mouth. A fifth thing people notice about a Star Kid is their self-assuredness and quiet confidence. They communicate the impression that they are quite aware of what is going on and have established their position towards the situation. In colloquial parlance, they stand on their own two feet most of the time. A sixth characteristic is intensity. Part of the extra energy hat these children are brimming with shows itself as their being intensely but quietly poised-for-action. Because they are such quick processors of information and of situations, they are poised for quick action. Putting all of these early impressions together: special energy, charm, brightness, presence, assuredness and intensity, it is not hard to see why so many people, when they deal with a Star Kid, say, “There’s something different about that kid.” The third question posed at the beginning of this chapter was, “Are Star Kids normal?”
129



This is a pretty basic question. Well, if by normal is meant that Star Kids have two eyes, a nose, two ears and a complexion pretty much like the other kids around, then, yes, Star Kids are normal. After all, they are mostly human. Why wouldn’t they look like other kids? In previous chapters, we looked at some of the physical, mental, emotional and psychic differences that Star Kids have. Here may be a good place to describe how they are like other children, the ways in which they seem “normal”. Star Kids tend to dress like other kids. Younger Star Kid boys will often wear the clothes boys their age commonly wear, like tee-shirts, jeans and ball caps. Younger Star Kid girls will wear dresses or pants like their age peers. Older Star Kid teens will do their own things, like other teens in their social group, be it preppy, grunge, hip-hop, “sagging”, cowboy, or whatever. You will not see a typical Star Kid in Star Trek attire. Nor in one of those “alien” helmets with the dual bobbing antennas. The last thing a Star Kid wants to do is affect the Space Cadet image. Did Star Kids talk like other kids? Oh, m’god, for sure! (Just kidding.) Actually, yes, Star Kids use the language and style of their age-peers. Except that if you listen intently to what they are saying amidst the slang and (in some cases) urban profanity, their analysis of what is going on and their mature perspective tend to give them away as not just another kid. Even the tykes among the Star Kids shine out from under the “precious” clothes some parents dress them in. I’m thinking of one two-year-old I know whose parents dress him up in traditional little-child clothes. His look telegraphs the impression, “My parents may dress me in these hokey clothes, but, hey! There’s an aware person in here, thank you very much.” Do Star Kids behave like other children? Well, hopefully you read Chapter Three and elsewhere, where Star Kids are described. Yes, in many things Star Kids behave like other children. In some cases they may behave like other children several years older than themselves. But the behaviors are recognizable in general. So, we are not talking about a Fifth Column of freak children trying not-too-successfully to infiltrate the ranks of normal children and “pass” for regular humans. We are talking about generally sweet, loveable “ordinary” children who happen to harbor some extraordinary gifts.
Star Kids, Romantic Love, And Its Counterfeits
The powerful energy-consciousness-personality field which surrounds Star Kids generates a powerful attractive force. This powerful feeling of attraction becomes at times the occasion for some misunderstandings between Star Kid teens, (and among some Star Seed adults). Because this strong feeling of attraction between Star Kids pervades each’s consciousness subtly yet powerfully and evocatively, a Star Kid teen can mistake this feeling for romantic or sexual attraction. The Star Teen may even feel that he or she is falling in love. Because, after all, the pull of attraction does not just occur at the level of pure consciousness, but is also mediated through the Star Teen’s physical body. And that physical body interprets the attraction experience through a set of hormonal responses. Those responses include at times increased heartbeat,
130



heightened attention, accelerated respiration, damp palms, and the beginnings of sexual arousal. A Star Kid teen, feeling all these, could assume that he or she is experiencing a romantic attraction or even sexual interest, when in fact all that he or she is actually experiencing is the attraction to a fellow Star Kid which commonly occurs. Of course, the flow of time provides further opportunities for the Star Kid to appraise the situation more accurately. Certainly, genuine attraction occurs between Star Kids. (How else do you think so many of your parents got together?) And yes, there certainly are genuine romantic relationships, sexual liaisons and marriages that occur among Star Seeds. But, if further exposure to the other Star Kid indicates that what is going on is “just” the general stronger attraction that Star Kids (and Star Seeds) experience with each other, and not genuine romance, then the Star Kids have the opportunity to recognize this, and redirect their behavior into friendship channels instead, and enjoy such friendships for the riches that they can provide. Parenthetically, this same misinterpretation of mutual attraction between Star Seed adults has caused some missteps as well in some instances. I know of a Star Seed adult who left his wife and started a romantic relationship with another Star Seed woman he met at a gathering of experiencers. This liaison did not last very long, because frankly they were of quite different personality temperaments. The Star Seed man is now back in the dating world, but still tends to gravitate to other Star Seed adults. He is less impetuous now. He seems to have learned through experience to differentiate Star Seed attraction from actual romantic interest. This differentiating is a skill which all Star Kid teens and Star Seed adults will have to master. In fact, I wish that all Star Kid teens and Star Seed adults came equipped with a special tag which read, “Consumer advisement: This product causes the wearer to exude a powerful energetic or magnetic field. Stepping too close to this energetic/magnetic field may cause temporary alteration of consciousness, increased heart rate and body temperature, and other biological and mental changes. Consumers are advised that other persons similarly equipped may tend to intensify these disordering effects when the fields come into too close contact with each other. Consumers are advised to avoid making substantial and lasting changes to their daily lives while in the presence of such fields, and to retreat to a calm isolated location to regain a state of normalcy before attempting to operate life decision-making. Consumers are also advised that prolonged exposure to Star Kid/Star Seed fields may cause lasting physical, mental and consciousness changes, which under continued exposure may become permanent.” Humor aside, these more powerful consciousness and energy fields in which today’s Star Kids live make for some interesting future possibilities. Because Star Kids and Star Seeds operate with such expanded and permeable consciousness fields around them, they are present for each other in open, transparent and available ways. And yet they operate also through a body which has its own agenda and ways of expression. Operating with such expansive and open consciousness fields, and with bodies suffused with and affected by such consciousness fields, today’s Star Kids have a more exciting future with many more possibilities, yet a field of potentiality which will require them to exercise more responsibility than the young people of earlier decades, for whom life’s paths were set out in more orderly and pre-ordained fashion. As Star Kids and Star Seeds fashion a new society on Earth, they are developing, and will
131



need to develop more, new ways of expressing awareness of each other, attraction, affection, friendship, and love. And the Star Kids and Star Seeds are developing a new and more sophisticated ethic of closeness without possession, of affection that does not confuse itself inappropriately with romance, and of friendships which transcend the usual parameters of common interests, similar age or physical attractiveness, because the new ethic is based on a clear recognition of the bond between Star Kids which transcends old-fashioned bases for relationship formation. This more sophisticated ethic will eventually facilitate the development of a noble, respectful and family-like community which is based on a common Star Seed heritage. This is the Star Kid Generation who are and will be building Fifth World society. Such a society will not look like, and certainly will not operate like, current corrupt Fourth World “culture”. The open, loving, transparent and trust-based Star Kid citizens who are populating the nascent Fifth World society excite us and give us hope. They are truly our best and brightest. They have the right stuff to remake our world. While the elders in current society may wish them well and hope to pass on a few words of wisdom to these Star Kids, probably the kindest gift today’s society can bestow on tomorrow’s children is to get out of their way.
Star Kid Teens and Love And Sex
Do Star Kids date? Do Star Kids make out? Do Star Kids “do it”? What kind of questions are those? Star Kids are like other young people their age. They have the same life development trajectory. They have the same need for companionship, the same need for the nurturance of physical affection, the same need for sexual release and fulfilment. So, naturally, Star Teens will date. And their dating will include the same wide variety of talking, flirting, pursuing, courting, going steady, romantic, loving, and sexual behavior as other teens. Since this chapter is, among other things, an affirmation of the basic normalcy of Star Kids and Star teens, it is not necessary to reproduce a dating manual here. What is different about Star Kids who date is that they bring a much more sophisticated and aware consciousness to the enterprise of dating. Remember, many Star Kids come equipped with mental telepathy, remote viewing, aura reading, advanced intuition, precognition, out-ofbody travel, and remote influencing. If you had any brains at all, and if you were of a mind to date a Star Kid teen, you certainly could not expect to get away with the kind of superficiality, dishonesty, deception, sneakiness and just plain bullshit that a person might expect to get away with in an ordinary teen relationship. Part of the new ways in which people deal with each other, and treat one another, are already starting to be worked out among high schoolers across the globe as the many Star Kids among them call their dating partner on any evasiveness, deception and lying. Just a Fifth World society can only be built on honesty, truth, and sincere mutual contributions by every member, so also today’s Star Kid teens are working out these issues in their relationships. And in the process, honing the skills that will go into conducting the other aspects of Fifth World society as well.

Are There Gay, Lesbian and Bi-Sexual Star Kids? Star Kids: New Era, New Sexuality: Spiritsexuality vs. Hetero-, Homo-, and Bisexuality
The next section was written by a Star Kid young person who speaks of “alternative”
psychosexual identities and sexualities as an insider. I thank him for his contribution to our developing understanding of Star Kid life from the inside.
(This Star Kid teen writes:)
“In heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality the basic drive is physical desires. In other words, how sexually appealing someone is physically is a major factor, especially in the beginning of a relationship. These sexualities are based on the "what" and not the "who" of the person. Relations based on these sexualities can become very wonderful ones when the "who" aspects are also important to the partners.
“A new sexuality that works in the reverse is becoming more prevalent. This new sexuality is called spiritsexuality. It is not limited to Star Kids and not all Star Kids are spiritsexuals. In this sexuality, people choose a mate on spiritual, emotion, mental, psychic, and magickal vibrations. Physical sex will probably occur between such couples, but to them it is only an artistic expression of their love for one another and not the reason that they are together. It is a luxury to have sex, but not a major need.
“Some confusion may occur because spiritsexuals are not concerned with gender and neither are bisexuals. This may lead some to believe that these two sexualities are the same. In fact, they are not, because in spiritsexuality, physical attraction is least important, and bisexuals find physical characteristics important.”
(Written by Aether Thetan Dragonwolf [pseudonym])
Aether, a British teenager, describes a new level of relationship which certainly leapfrogs over the current interminable debate over heterosexuality versus homosexuality. Aether even outlines a new level of relationship formation and relationship conduct which transcends concerns over gender and physical sexual expression. Given the advanced development of Star Kids, and their rich development in mental, spiritual and metaphysical gifts, is it surprising that they would place more value and emphasis on the areas of their relationships where their abilities are most developed?
Over the past few years I have had the opportunity to meet several trans-gender Star Seeds. As with many other Star Kids and Star Seeds, it is my impression that the trans-gender issues come up because of reincarnation life path trajectories which do not always mesh effortless from one lifetime to the next. Certainly for Star Kids who are trying to forge a clear, proud and affirmative sense of self and identity in this world, the issue of clarifying one’s genuine underlying true psychosexual identity adds an additional dimension.
As society in general becomes more aware of the truth of reincarnation, (which is not
133



disputed by a single star civilization “out there”), it likely will become easier for the citizens of tomorrow to understand, appreciate and accept the work that trans-gender individuals, including Star Kids, undertake to clarify and affirm their truest inner self.
Star Kids, Star Seeds, and Body Acceptance in Fifth World Society
As I write this Section, I am sitting on the sand at Red Rock Beach in northern California, near the town of Stinson Beach. Red Rock for many years has been a traditional naturist beach. Naturism is a European-developed term for a philosophy of body acceptance which holds that the body is wholesome, is affirming of personal integrity, of the acceptability of the body as nature created it, and affirms a basic degree of social trust, and of optimistic social familiarity. This philosophy therefore also believes that in mutually-agreeable social and climactic situations, living, playing, working or recreating without clothes is acceptable. On this beach I am stark naked, and surrounding me on the beach are 30 other stark naked people. All ages are represented, but the beach is dotted predominantly by college-age young people . Most all are well-tanned all over, indicating that this is far from their first nude experience outdoors. In front of me is a lively coed game of frisbee being played by seven high-energy people at the edge of the water. Only one of them, a shy teenage boy, is wearing anything. And, perhaps not coincidentally, he is the only one whom the dowsing rods I carry indicate is not a Star Kid. Elsewhere, people are sitting in groups of two or three, sunbathing or chatting. A few are body-surfing. The energy is serene, lovely. Everyone is having a good time. There is no sexual tone. Everyone conducts themself pretty much the same as they would if they happened to have a swimsuit on. Except that people are friendlier. It feels more like the flavor of an extended-family gathering, or a neighborhood block party. It is as though the dropping of clothes coincided with the dropping of social distance, social reserve, social pretense, the need to keep one’s distance. There is something psychological that goes on with one when one decides to forego clothing. You make yourself more exposed and vulnerable. Yes, it is an act of trust. And it is respected as such by those around you, who reciprocate in kind by their trust, their body humility, and their exuberant enjoyment of nature. It is also a way of connection to nature without any barriers of clothing in the way. Indeed, once a little social-nudity experience has moved you past curiosity about how other people’s bodies look, (there is only so much variation), and past the very-temporary arousal that a cynically-manipulative materialistic culture has conditioned us to associate with the bare body, you are freed to be a transparent peer with your fellow man and woman, without shame, without lust, without wardrobe concerns and anxieties. Sun, breezes, and surf touch every square inch of your body at the same time. Whether you are walking at the water’s edge caressed by the ocean breeze, or wading in the shorebreak where waves, sand and foam all come together, you soon find it harder to tell where you leave off and nature begins. You feel at one with nature surrounding you. It is an experience that can have metaphysical moments, and can lead to an altered state of consciousness, and to bliss.
134



Because good science can be done anywhere, even at a nude beach, and because being a good scientist, I decided to use this opportunity to ascertain how many people here are Star Kids and Star Seeds. I got out my dowsing rods, and without drawing attention, casually pointed them in the direction of various people. The numbers were impressive: about 95% of those present had the energy signature of a Star Kid or Star Seed. This single survey at one nude beach is not meant to suggest that every naturist is a Star Kid or Star Seed. Nor is it meant to suggest that every Star Kid and Star Seed is a naturist. Strictly speaking, it is not enough of a scientific sample to confirm a hypothesis. But, what this one overwhelming statistic does suggest, in my analysis, is that Star Kids (and Star Seed adults) find the nature-affirmation and the underlying personal and social values of naturism very appealing, and congruent with the consciousness and other values which Star Kids possess. And that may help explain why Star Kids and Star Seeds are so well represented at naturist natural settings.
Star Kids And Recreation
Star Kids are certainly normal in the aspect that they enjoy play and recreation just like other children. And, like normal children they like to go to summer camp. But because they are Star Kids, what they’d do at summer camp might look a little different than what often goes on at regular summer camps. Recently I worked with other helpers to put together a summer camp for Star Kids. I’d like to share with you some excerpts from the schedule for this summer camp for Star Kids. It will give you some idea of the similarities and differences that are part of the lives of Star Kids. I will mostly cite the unusual (paranormal) activities, but also mention enough of the ordinary camp activities to provide a flavor of what the camping experience was like for the Star Kids who attended.

Chapter 11
Meet Some Actual Star Kids
Let’s meet some actual Star Kids. The following descriptions and vignettes are all true. Only the names of these twelve Star kids have been altered to preserve their anonymity. Some may notice that among these dozen Star Kids, the girls outnumber the boys two-toone. Why is this? Well, one factor is that many more girls show up for Star Kid Workshops and other events than do boys. Why is this? It certainly does not seem to be because there are more female Star Kids than male Star Kids. The Star Visitors have not displayed a gender preference when contacting humans. And it is my impression from the hundreds upon hundreds of Star Kids (and Star Seeds) that I have encountered that both sexes are about equally represented. Certainly another factor at work here is that in contemporary American culture, for one, there is more cultural permission for girls and women to acknowledge metaphysical reality and having psychic abilities than for males to do so. Thus, it is that although there are about equal numbers of Star Kid boys and girls, more girls step forward to get involved in Star Kid events than do boys. It may be that in contemporary American culture, boys are still more reluctant to identify in public with the gentle, interior, sensitive qualities that are part of being a Star Kid. These boys know they are different, but in the predominantly Fourth World culture surrounding them, it is often more comfortable for these boys to “stay in the closet” about their Star Kid nature. For the same reason, there may be more Latent Star Kid boys than Latent Star Kid girls. The Star Kids you meet in this chapter are out of the closet. They are joyous about being a Star Kid, and about being accepted as one. Caitlin is a quiet, intellectual, comely, brunette eight-year-old who is short for her age. She has a hearing impairment. She lives with her mother, her older brother, and her mom’s boyfriend. Her parents are divorced. Caitlin’s mother is psychic, and is also a devotee of Hindu spirituality, and has studied with Sai Baba. Caitlin has had Star Visitor contact since she was very young. She reported to her mother that almost nightly she has been taken aboard a star craft, where she joined with other children in participating in a school conducted by the Star Visitors. Caitlin learned many things there, including being shown actual scenes from history as History lessons. As a result of this advanced pedagogy, Caitlin has experienced some problems at school when the teacher talks about an incident in history, and Caitlin raises her hand and contradicts the teacher, saying, “No, that’s not what happened. Here is how it happened.” Over her eight years Caitlin has displayed various psychic abilities, including mental telepathy, clairvoyance (future sight), and levitation. Caitlin and her older brother exchange telepathic messages at home. Caitlin also does this with her mother. When I first met Caitlin, she did not need a formal introduction, but walked right up to me and gave me a big hug. Her mother explained to me Caitlin’s sign-language message that she already knew me before I stepped through the door. Caitlin can get so absorbed in meditation that she levitates off the floor.

She is usually very shy around strangers, but she has a ready empathic engagement with Star Seed adults. There has been a struggle around the school district’s placing Caitlin into a Special Education class for the Handicapped, because she does not relate to the other kids in that class, who have to exert themselves to master their subjects, while Caitlin finds it quite easy. She also misses the social life with her peers, and hopes that an operation to correct her hearing disorder can take place. Then she could be mainstreamed with her age mates and have a more normal schoolchild life. Her mother has taught Caitlin to be careful about not overtly displaying her psychic abilities where she could get unwelcome attention. Already her mother has observed clandestine surveillance of her house, and has seen white vans go by repeatedly that she feels may be from the government. She does not want her daughter to receive any more undue attention from the authorities. Nevertheless, life is cheerful around Caitlin’s house, and she remains a bright, cheery, appealing young lady, who is hopeful about her future. Luke is a very bright, pleasant, poised blond 13-year-old boy with a cherubic expression. He is sociable, but mainly with other Star Kids. Otherwise, he is a book worm. His favorite way to spend time is curled up with a book., unless there is some kid activity actually going on at the moment. Luke does extremely well in school. Luke is at an age where he is making the transition from childhood to adulthood. While he loves his mother, he has drawn very close to his father. He loves accompanying his father on camping and hiking trips, and clearly is honing his sense of male identity. Luke has recently become aware of being a Star Kid. While he has previously had informal and unstructured psychic experiences, such as mental telepathy or seeing other people’s auras, he now is athirst with desire to learn about all of the various psychic abilities. He wants to acquire mastery of as many as possible. Luke was fascinated, for example, when I described to him how another young man I had worked with had achieved success with telekinetically moving a toothpick which was just floating in a glass of water. Luke could not wait to get home to try this feat out for himself. Luke is a speed reader, although he has never been trained formally to do so. He devoured a book I gave him in less than a day, although he was also occupied with other activities that day as well. I see Luke as sort of a latter-day Harry Potter. He would have been quite comfortable in the Hogwart’s School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Luke strikes me as the kind of Star Kid who will not rest until he gets good at all the psychic abilities. He is a perfectionist, and it simply will not do to have some psychic power “just happen” spontaneously, with his having no control over it. No, Luke is bent of being able to do a very wide range of what some consider wizard tricks. If determination is any measure, I suspect that Luke will end up making Harry Potter look like a beginner. One psychic who knows Luke told me that she foresaw that Luke would grow up to be a leader as Fifth World society dawns. From what I have seen of Luke, I would have to agree with her prediction. Samantha is a sharp but shy and insecure, highly sensitive Star Kid teenager with hair the color of amber honey. This pretty 16-year-old high school junior has the petite, lithe body of a pixie. She lives with her mother, a widow who is disabled. Her older brother has left home, and only returns occasionally to visit.

Samantha has had a difficult time in school, but not because of the difficulty of the subject matter. She is a quick study, and understands new material very fast if it is presented clearly. Because she lives in a low-income rural community, the teachers at her school are often not very good. This has presented a challenge for Samantha, and also for her mother. Samantha tended to lose interest in a class where the presentation was mushy, and geared to the slower learners in the class. As a result, Samantha tuned out, got assigned low grades, and wanted to drop out. In her junior-high years, Samantha experienced the typical decline in interest in academics, and increased attention to social life, girl chum relationships, and parties. As is the case in other poor remote communities where the young people complain that there is nothing to do, these parties tended to be surreptitious, held at the home of a child whose parents were not home, and involved alcohol and sometimes drugs. Samantha was not boy-crazy in junior high, and observed the shallow, exploitative and cruel relationships that her girl chums were involved in with detachment and disinterest. She had no interest in being cheated on and dumped like too many of her friends had been. High school turned out not to be any improvement, due to the same factors that had plagued her junior-high years. Out of a sense of frustration, her mother then tried home-schooling. But this brought its own set of problems, because the materials provided by the school district use approaches and concepts, for example in mathematics and social studies, which are different than those with which the mother is acquainted with. As a result, the mother has had difficulty being effective as a home teacher with the instructional materials the school district has provided. Another problem with the home schooling strategy is that Samantha missed the social interaction with the other school kids her age. Finally her mother hit upon a solution which seems to be working. Samantha is now enrolled in a correspondence-course, self-tutorial form of home study. These correspondence courses are individually paced and feature clear, self-explanatory didactic workbooks. A student like Samantha takes one course at a time, completes and mails in the assignments, gets graded, and when passed, is promoted to the next subject. These distance-learning correspondence course materials do not assume a previous solid foundation in these subjects. Samantha is like many young people who have been let down by schools and teachers who are no match for these new kids and their learning styles. These materials start with foundations missed in earlier grades, and rapidly accelerate through the workbook in stages to college-prep levels of presentation. Thus, apt students like Samantha (and so many other Star Kids in similar circumstances) can fill in the gaps in foundational learning, and rapidly accelerate to the upper levels of secondary education. It may come as a surprise to some outsiders, but being a Star Kid is not necessarily selfevident. Samantha remembers having had contact by the Star Visitors since she was four. And she was having telepathic mental exchanges with her brother and mother as far back as first grade. As well as she can remember, she has been able to consciously look into the future and foresee things which later on come true. For example, she looked at a girl who is currently at that time her best friend, and foresaw that the friend was going to go downhill and get messed up on drugs and self-degrading promiscuity, and that Samantha would no longer have her as a friend. Samantha has been generally able to intuit and clairvoyantly size people up, as well as know whether they are telling the truth, since fifth grade. Since she was eight years old she has exercised healing and “balancing” powers with
141



people, plants and animals. With people she says modestly that it is not so much that she heals them as that she balances what has gotten off-kilter within them, and that it is that re-balancing which is what helps people heal. Samantha has been assisted in recognizing and cultivating these and other psychic abilities by the guidance of her psychic mother. Her mother’s friend, a hypnotherapist and psychic healer and remote viewer, also provides tips and encouragement. Both these women are Star Seeds themselves. Samantha has had another struggle which many Star Kid young people can identify with drugs. Like too many poor rural communities in America, her home area has an epidemic methamphetamine (“speed”) problem, and a pervasive drug culture throughout the community. Because of the area’s remoteness, poverty and lack of resources, especially for youth, most kids have succumbed to the lure of very frequent partying, with one or more drugs and alcohol in use. Samantha has not been an exception to partying, but she has maintained enough perspective to avoid the more destructive “speed” and “downer” kinds of drugs. Since sixth grade she has been smoking pot (cannabis). For a while she developed such a self-described addiction that if she were deprived of marijuana for day, she would become irritable and prone to emotional outbursts. It has not been helpful that her older brother has become severely involved in drugs, “graduating” from cannabis to opioid downers to methamphetamine. The brother has severe Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, which was never diagnosed nor treated by the cashstrapped school district. And in all fairness, it may well be true for him, as for so many young people, that his drug use may represent a naive attempt at self-medication of his neurological condition. Samantha has had some of her psychic experiences while intoxicated on cannabis. This has served as a temptation to her to rationalize using consciousness-altering drugs as tools to achieve psychic experiences. She “progressed” from marijuana to psychedelic mushrooms, and finds it tempting to also experiment with acid (LSD). Parenthetically, the fact that certain psychedelic drugs can seemingly induce or amplify psychic experiences presents a quandary to Star Kids and their parents. If psychedelic drugs were merely amplifiers of psychic powers, there might be less unfavorable things to be said about them. But even then, using psychedelics to achieve a psychic experience has several down-sides. For one, the psychic experience is usually spontaneous, and is not elicited nor controlled by the youngster. Second, using psychedelics this way breeds laziness in the young psychic Star Kid, who is thus given a rationale for not disciplining herself so as to be able to deliberately exercise her ability under her conscious control and direction. And other down-sides also exist. Psychedelics can “addict” the user to laying aside significant portions of daily life to instead tune into the drug-induced circus going on insider her head. It can also give the undisciplined user an excuse to drop out of important daily activities and spend an inordinate amount of time in interior recreation, thus causing an imbalance in the Star Kid’s life. Another down-side is the risk of unintentionally taking an overdose, since reliable information about safe and effective dose for a given age and body weight is not generally available publicly. Still other down-sides include: experiencing a toxic reaction to the substance, having an accident, even a fatal one, while attempting to operate a car while under the influence, having the drug precipitate a mental disorder (in a susceptible person), having a stroke due to a sudden rise in blood pressure, etc. Samantha says that she has gotten beyond the addictive use of marijuana in her life, although she will occasionally indulge in an infrequent joint. She says that she gained insight on
142



her own that the addictive use of cannabis was a disorder in her life. She rationalizes her occasional use nowadays for its “stress-reducing” tranquilizing effect, or when she especially wants to have a psychic experience. When I challenged her that she could have psychic experiences without pot, she says that she knows that, but “it’s easier that way.” Star Kids are neither all saints nor all sinners, but rather struggling kids in a limited Fourth World culture, in a number of ways not unlike their ordinary human age mates. Samantha has shown some Star Kid qualities of compassion and concern for others, even when immersed in her local area’s culture of drugs. Samantha has reached out to other teens she knows and tried to get them off drugs, especially the more hazardous drugs such as methamphetamine and phencycladine (PCP). Samantha has participated in Star Kid Project events and has talked in public about being a Star Kid. Several psychics spoke to me and identified her as destined to be a leader in the emerging Fifth World society as she grows up. Samantha herself is somewhat aware of her leadership qualities. After completing high school studies, she plans to attend a metaphysical college and get a degree as a metaphysical practitioner and teacher. She thus will be in a better position to help others understand and use well their psychic and other advanced abilities in the dawning Fifth World society. Lupita is a quiet, bright, cheerful, chubby, 13-year-old Mexican-American girl of medium height and brunette hair. This Star Kid comes across with a maturity far beyond her years. She lives in a conventional Mexican-American family in a large city in the American Southwest. Her parents do not really understand nor appreciate her psychic abilities. They are cautious about such things and, operating out of superstitious fear, see them as suspect. There is a vein of sentiment in the Mexican culture which views such things as the domain of the brujo (warlock) and the bruja (witch), and as such to be feared and avoided. Lucky for Lupita she has an aunt, Alicia, her mother’s sister, who spotted Lupita as a Star Kid. Aunt Alicia twisted her sister’s arm and persuaded her to allow Alicia to take Lupita to a Star Kid Workshop© and another such event. Lupita shines in such settings, finally able to mingle with kids who are truly her peers. There she does not have to hold back being who she really is. Lupita is poised and comes across as years older than she is. She easily speaks her mind, has a droll sense of humor, and is liked by the other Star Kids. Lupita’s advanced abilities include being able to see events ahead of time, doing mental telepathy, seeing auras around people, intuitiveness, and using crystals for energy work. She is very receptive to learning about and developing her other psychic abilities as well. Lupita has a very close relationship with her aunt. Alicia works hard to encourage Lupita in developing herself as a Star Kid. Alicia also runs interference with Lupita’s mother so as to allow Lupita to unfold as who she really is. Alicia’s open-mindedness and ownership of herself as a Star Seed serve as a counterweight to Lupita’s mother’s superstitious fears. Alicia has thus shown by the events she has succeeded in taking Lupita to that terrible things will not occur if Lupita’s mother allows Lupita to blossom as a Star Kid. Denise is a sharp, self-assured, gracious, charming, pretty, 10-year-old- going-on-25 Star Kid with straight blonde hair and a knowing twinkle in her eye. Denise is just getting used to her identity as a Star Kid. But she has exhibited psychic abilities and special energy for years. Denise is another Star Kid whose parents don’t exactly know what to make of her. But like Lupita,
143



Denise was lucky enough to have someone else in the family who did. Denise’s grandmother has some psychic awarenesses and abilities herself, and may be a Latent Star Seed, although she modestly says that she does not see that in herself. But grandma had a sharp eye, and spotted Denise’s Star Kid qualities. So she persuaded Denise’s mother to let her come to a Star Kids Project event, where Denise blossomed in the presence of the other Star Kids. And Denise got an opportunity to identify her advanced abilities and exercise them. Denise is energetic and sociable, and all the other Star Kids at the event liked her. She laughs easily and exudes good humor. Denise’s grandmother accompanied her to this Star Kids Project event, and told me how she watched this special child since she was very young. She noticed that, from an early age, Denise seemed very mature, almost like an adult in a child’s body. Denise does very well in school, and is in the top tier of her class. Denise has ready mental communication with animals. She is sensitive to other’s energy fields. She is attracted to nature-based spirituality, and is at ease with Native American spiritual ceremonies. Not surprisingly, her bio-electromagnetic field is unusually widely extended, even for a Star Kid. At the Star Kids Project group event, her field measured among the largest. A psychic attending the event foresaw that Denise would be a future leader in the emerging Fifth World society, like Luke and Samantha. Because she is still quite young, it is difficult to see the contours of her leadership style as yet. But anyone who spends much time around this quiet, deep, self-possessed, optimistic spirit would feel that the country would be blessed to have such a leader providing direction. Maggie is another 10-year-old Star Kid, petite, with curly dark hair. Maggie is an ocean of endless energy and infectious engagingness. Although thin and of diminuitive size for her age, Maggie lights up a room when she enters. She bubbles with a never-ending stream of ideas for things to do. She is an extreme extrovert, and when a question is asked in the group, she is he first to answer, usually without raising her hand first. Although Maggie is extremely sociable, she does not brag about her psychic abilities. Because her mother accompanied Maggie to one of our Star Kids Project events, I was able to talk with the mother about Maggie. Her mother is a psychic, too, and encourages he budding talents of this young Star Kid. One of Maggie’s outstanding gifts is to see into other dimensions. When we took a Star Kids field trip to Mount Shasta, (a 14,000-foot gigantic “dormant” volcano in Northern California), as we hiked through the high-altitude meadows, Maggie shouted out for everyone to hear that she had found where the fairies were, and pointed excitedly to a dense thicket in the meadow. Panther Meadow is a sacred location to the Native American people of the region, and is a spiritual destination for people from around the world. So it is actually not all that surprising that fairies should be present there, and occasionally show themselves across dimensions. Maggie has other advanced abilities as well. She is telepathic, and reads animal and plant energy signatures with ease, can see auras, and can make herself “invisible” when she wants to elude the notice of other people, etc. If the Fifth World society needs a cheerleader, (and I’m beginning to think that we will), Maggie would have to be the choice hands-down. Veronica is a different kind of story. She is a Latent Star Kid that I would like to tell you about. She is a cute, lively, polite, sociable eighth-grader with short blonde hair and an ever
144



present smile. She lives in the Western United States with her very conservative parents and older sister, who is about to emancipate from the home. Veronica is very bright and is at the head of her class. She maintains an A average in her grades, and finds it easy to master the subjects in school. She has a natural gift for animals, who feel an affinity or her as well. She hopes to grow up to be either a veterinarian or a massage therapist. She has a subconscious awareness of people’s energy and seeks to work with it. Veronica is open-minded but is trapped within the confines of a politically and culturally ultraconservative and hyper-controlling family. Her sister, who is five years older, and who is also a Latent Star Kid, copes by hanging out as much as possible at her friends’ houses, where she can be more herself. Veronica, being much younger, is not allowed as much freedom to be elsewhere afternoons and evenings very much. Her situation is complicated by her father’s being a progressed “social drinker” alcoholic. Veronica’s mother is co-dependent and does not challenge the hyper-controlling father’s domineering way. She deals with her husband’s drinking every evening until he passes out by going to bed early in the evening herself before this happens. I have known Veronica for years. When I showed her how her bio-electromagnetic field caused the dowsing rods to splay outwardly when at a distance of 18 feet from her body, and explained that this was because she was a Star Kid, and what that means, she excitedly went into the house to share this with her family. I also used the dowsing rods with Veronica’s older sister, and showed her that she, too, had Star Kid energy. She was pleasantly intrigued, but was astute enough not to share the news of her being a Star Kid with her parents. She knew they would not be charmed nor accepting. Her father soon emerged with an omni-present beer bottle in his hand and politely informed me that he did not want Veronica involved with any such “strange stuff”. Veronica and her sister are a couple of the Latent Star Kids. They clearly have the energy signature, the intelligence, and likely some of the advanced abilities of Star Kids. But they are not in a position to come to terms with their identity as Star Kids, because the repressive confines of their family do not provide them the permission and encouragement to discover things about themselves that are not officially sanctioned by society’s authorities. Veronica is an example of one of the ways in which many Star Kids stay Latent. Parental disbelief and disapproval are powerful disincentives against a child’s self-discovery. And by the same token, the Star Kids I have met who shine as the most fully developed and confident are the ones whose families are solidly behind them. Nicole is a medium-height, trim, attractive, brown-eyed 16-year-old with short brunette hair in a pixie cut. This lively and special Star Kid lives in the desert mountains of the Southwest. She fairly radiates serene yet powerful Star Kid energy. Star Kid energy is a little difficult to describe. If you are a Star Kid or a Star Seed, you can feel it coming off another Star Kid. It is a feeling of extra energy in that person, a brightness, a quickness, an aura of compassion, of goodness, of high spirituality, that is not easy for a fellow Star Kid to miss. Nicole has the good fortune to have a highly-perceptive mother, who understands her highly-talented daughter and encourages her development. Nicole’s mother herself is a Star Seed, and has brought up her daughter to be familiar with the world of the metaphysical and the psychic. As a result, Nicole has the usual complement of Star Kid advanced abilities.
145



But Nicole’s forte is vibration work. She has learned that much healing can be accomplished by the application of a correct vibration level. Nicole is also aware that vibration serves as a medium of communication with the Star Visitors, and they with us. Nicole’s preeminent way of delivering vibrational energy is by singing. Her specialty is operatic singing. She is blessed with an exceptionally pure and talented voice, which allows her to deliver a vibrational note with absolute pitch-perfect accuracy. During one Star Kids Project event, I witnessed Nicole gathered in an acoustical chamber with a 10-year-old Star Kid boy and an adult Star Seed man sitting facing each other so that the three formed a perfect triangle in the exact center of the domed acoustical chamber. Nicole and the other two did unison singing of a pure note, with Nicole setting the base note, and the Star Kid boy and Star Seed man singing notes in harmonic octaves around the base note. The resulting rich tapestry of harmonic sound resonated powerfully throughout the acoustic chamber. Later, Nicole explained to me that the three were doing song vibrational work to help heal the Earth. They were well positioned, since the acoustical dome was located upon a vortex in an area long known for its special energy. Claudio is a tall, thin, bright-eyed, quiet young man who lives in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This dark-eyed, handsome 17-year-old with dark hair attended the first Star Kids Workshop© in Brazil. Since I do not peak Portuguese, and an English translator was only intermittently available, I was not able to get very much information about Claudio. But he became permanently etched in my memory when I did the dowsing rods exercise on him, along with the other Star Kids and adult Star Seeds in attendance. Let me note that I had done dowsing on the energy fields of several hundred persons by the time I met Claudio. What etched him in my memory is that this quiet lad set the record (at that time) for the largest bio-electromagneticphotic field That I had measured. Claudio’s field measured at least a 50-foot radius out from his body! Yet you would hardly meet a humbler, more unassuming young man. In our brief conversation I became impressed with his deep spirituality and desire to improve himself metaphysically. Did his devotion to spirituality play a role in the expansive size of his energy field? I cannot say for certain, but such a connection would not be surprising. Rachel is a lovely, pretty brunette 12-year-old schoolgirl who lives in southern Australia with her mum. She is another one of those fortunate Star Kids whose parent is metaphysically aware and accepting her child for all that she is. Her mother’s friend, Jill, is a psychic, and closely follows Rachel’s progress as she grows up and unfolds in her psychic abilities. With the strong support of these two women, Rachel’s future is one that seems very optimistic and tranquil. I met Rachel at a Star Kids Workshop we held in Brisbane, Australia. Accompanied by her mother and “Aunt” Jill, Rachel was a highly attentive and participating member of the Workshop. She eagerly engaged in the various psychic exercises we practiced. At the end of the Workshop, she came up to me and gave me a drawing of an aging Zeta Reticulan who is a frequent Visitor. She told of going aboard his craft, and of being schooled there. In addition to the schooling on board, Rachel receives visits in her bedroom at night. She has developed an intense friendship with this Zeta senior, who has told her to call him “Horace”. It turns out that even elderly Zetas have some cosmetic sensibilities. Horace gave Rachel a message, when she drew a picture of him for me, not to include too many wrinkles,
146



since he did not want to appear too worn in his appearance. (And to think that some people believe that all Zetas are cool and emotionless.) Kenza is a tall, thin, handsome 16-year-old African-American student who lives with his mother in Colorado. Kenza participated in the Star Kids Workshop in New York City as an energetic and articulate member. Kenza has well-developed telepathic and precognitive abilities. It is helpful, of course, that his mother is also aware of her own psychic abilities, and supports Kenza in his using his gifts. Kenza shows signs of natural leadership. At the Workshop, when there was an opportunity for Star Kids to share about their personal journey of self-discovery, Kenza boldly stepped up to the microphone and gave a stirring account of his successful struggle to overcome doubts and the subtle pressures of society, and recognize and acknowledge within himself those special gifts which come with being a Star Kid. His poise, self-assurance, humility and charm in handling and answering questions from the participants point to qualities which will likely cause him to rise to leadership as his generation of Star Kids soon comes of age. Sabrina is a cheerful, medium-height, attractive, stocky 29-year-old social worker with shoulder-length, darkening blonde hair. She is a former Star Kid now turned adult Star Seed. Her story is included because it traces a path that is less conventional, of a Star Kid who was a “Latent”throughout childhood, and who came into Star Seed awareness as a young adult. When did her Star Seed father know that Sabrina was a Star Kid? Well, in hind sight, he says it is clear that it was at the moment of her conception. He saw in his mind’s eye the dark nighttime firmament through the roof overhead, and at that moment, a new little star turned on and shone in the inky blackness above. Sabrina was a free spirit ever since she was born. She was raised on a five-acre ranchette in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In the 1970s, when she was born, there was no talk of Star Kids in those days. Even the subject of UFOs was fraught with ridicule if anyone brought it up. But Sabrina early on was a special being. Around the ranch this free spirit hardly ever wore a stitch of clothing. If her father or mother put a dress on her in warm weather, she would soon peel it off and run through the fields of wild flowers on the property naked. It was not until she got to grade school and peer pressure came to bear upon her that she began to dress and take on the point of view of the other country kids of her peer group. Her father was into Native American culture, and since Sabrina and her sister had a small portion of Cherokee blood line in their heritage, it seemed that she and her sister took naturally to the Native American ceremonies that her father would conduct. Her favorite was the Rain Ceremony. This rain ceremony was done the most during the time of the multi-year drought that was then plaguing Northern California. Her father would gather his two part-Native American daughters and assemble in the broad open acreage sloping down the hill from their house. (Their mother would sit out most ceremonies as “too weird” for her taste.) First there was a purification via smudging with the smoke from a smoldering sacred sage bundle, to purify participants and bless the area of the proceedings. Their father would smudge the girls, and then Sabrina or her sister took turns smudging their father. Next, her father would have Sabrina or her sister twirl the “bull roarer” (sounding wood palette on a string) over their
147



head to set up the vibratory field which would summon Tukwunag (the Rain Kachina) and the Wakinyan (Thunder Beings) to come and bring the much-needed precipitation to drench the parched land and replenish the water table. Though they were in the primary grades, Sabrina and her sister quickly took to this ceremonial activity. Next came the Pipe Ceremony, with prayer to Great Spirit to bring rain clouds over the land. The father lit the pipe, took a draft of smoke from it, and prayed to each of the Four Directions, to Tunkasila (Grandfather Above), and to Unce Maka (Mother Earth). Sabrina and her sister took tiny puffs, but did not inhale them, instead blowing the smoke up towards the sky, accompanied by a prayer to Spirit to hear their pleas for soothing rain. Spirit could not, of course, ignore the petitions of such tiny pure spirits. Within a day or two, the skies would cloud up. And Sabrina and her sister were duly impressed as the barren sky grew cloudy and a gentle rain began to fall. Let us now fast-forward across Sabrina’s life to adulthood. Sabrina had long since taken in stride her father’s intense interest in the UFO phenomenon. She thus had a context for her first conscious UFO encounter when she was 19. She was driving back home from the San Francisco Bay Area when she spotted a UFO doing relatively low-level maneuvers above Interstate 580 near Altamont Pass. She excitedly drove home and informed her family and friends about seeing a UFO for the first time! Sabrina kept some of her life private, but clearly had some partially-remembered Star Visitor contact. When her father was describing to her his close encounter on a desert highway, and the part where the Star Visitors placed their hands firmly on his arms to lead him to their craft, as he described the Visitors’ hands with their three elongated, cartilaginous (non-bony) fingers that wrapped way around most of his large biceps, she shuddered involuntarily and begged him to stop – clearly recalling her own similar encounter, with which she had not yet come to terms. Sabrina came to a Star Kids/Star Seeds Workshop in Northern California, and brought with her a couple of Star Seed co-workers and their Star Kid children. She let down her hair and acknowledged some of the Star Kid psychic abilities she had. She encouraged her co-workers to talk about their gifts as well. By this point Sabrina was fully out of the closet, and quietly owning in public to being a Star Seed adult. Her father had no surprise with this unfolding of self-awareness. Indeed, he knew that Sabrina was a Star Kid long years before. Sabrina is an example of a Star Kid who is unaware in childhood, and only after reaching adulthood becomes aware retroactively that she had been a Star Kid right along. Okay, now you have met twelve Star Kids. No three eyes; no long green tentacles, no horns, no campiness, no New Age-y affectations. Just wholesome kids trying to make their way in a world generally not yet prepared to really understand them and deal with them. I hope that as you read about these kids, you see that not only do the rest of the population have nothing to fear from these kids, but rather have everything to gain from making a welcoming place in our society for these Star Kids.

Chapter 12
Parents Of Star Kids: “What Do We Do Now?”
The following is an excerpt from a dialogue I had with a parent whose teenager was just starting to have to deal with his paranormal abilities, and was still deeply in denial of Star Visitor reality. And, like most teens, this teen was wanting to safely hide out in the conventionality of how regular people saw the world. The presenting issue was that he saw “furniture” in his room where there was none. And he was resistant to accepting the reality of ESP/psychic abilities which his 9-year-old younger sister and his mother had already long since calmly accepted as part of their lives. The mother wrote about how Jeremy came to her room at night, panicky because he saw furniture there which should not have been there. He further panicked when his mother told him that she saw no furniture there. The mother wondered if Jeremy’s nocturnal fear was an example of the psychological disorder called Night Terror. I answered her as follows.
“Jeremy is _not_ suffering from clinical Night Terror Disorder. “It looks like the Star Visitors have decided that it is time to move Jeremy past his denial, that we spoke of in our last e-mail. Probably because they know that you are now in communication with me, and therefore there is an avenue of informed interpretation you have access to in order to make sense of what is happening for Jeremy. Though he was frightened, he is paying attention to the anomalies, and that is good. “What happened was that the Star Visitors (most likely those from the Zeta Reticuli star system) decided to administer a little reality consciousness-expanding exercise for Jeremy. They disguised themselves (influenced Jeremy's mind to see them as) items of furniture in his bedroom. I would venture to guess that even the "furniture" moved a little on its own. The real furniture you own had not yet arrived with the movers. Jeremy therefore was faced with a jolting experience of "cognitive dissonance", seeing with his own eyes something that "cannot be". This panicked him and he came to you. Well and good. The Star Visitors have softened up his intellectual beachhead, so that he is now more ready to accept what you have to say about what is going on in paranormal/non-ordinary reality. He knows that the "ordinary reality" he was sold in school no longer fully applies. “You can therefore provide Jeremy now with both information and reassurance. You might say something like this to Jeremy: (Mother): "Jeremy, what you experienced the other night was... (fill in with my explanation above). The reason you had that experience was because you were being stubborn and not accepting that there are paranormal realities that happen to people regularly. Now that you have had a direct experience of such paranormal reality, you are more ready to accept that such is real. You have had a visit from the Star Visitors. They are real. They are friendly and not here to harm you. You do not need to be afraid of them, but you do need to be respectful, and even to open your mind to learn what they came here to show you and tell you. As you decide to
149



be brave and not afraid, they can drop the disguises, and begin to let you see them as they actually look like. They will most probably look like one of the Visitor types shown at:
( http://www.drboylan.com/StarVisitorPictures/VisitorPhotos.html ) “Do not panic nor be spooked when they show themselves. An individual visit like this is a great privilege. Many people would pay any amount of money to have such a visit. “Your sister is a Star Kid and has advanced abilities due to either a Star Visitor contact, or their genetic upgrading of my ovum during a visit to me before she was born. “Now it is your turn to wake up to not only the advanced abilities which are laying dormant within you, but also to the fact that you are in contact with persons from the stars. “I, your mother, am a Star Seed. I am proud of it. You do not see me afraid. You are a growing 14-year-old teenage boy. You like to think of yourself as brave and strong, and you are. “Replace your fear with wonder and curiosity, and a readiness to launch into this new and most exciting phase of your growing up! And I am with you all the way in this, Jeremy. “We are the new generation, of Star Seeds and Star Kids, you and I and your sister. Let's be proud, aware, and get ourselves ready for the important days ahead, where we can bring these extra gifts to good use for the folks around us." The mother wrote me back gratefully that she was going to take that approach with her son. This vignette illustrates the new kind of parenting that today’s moms and dads need to prepare themselves to do to be relevant to today’s Star Kids. Being a parent to a Star Kid can seem daunting. There are a number of things that parents of Star Kids need to keep in mind. It may seem overwhelming at the early stages, but don’t worry. Very many other parents of Star Kids have succeeded in raising wonderful children, even without the resources that are becoming available now. Obviously you want to be a good parent to your Star Kid or you would not be reading this book. So, already you have one of the most fundamentally necessary qualities in a parent wanting to help. There are of course numerous and various ways that a parent can help their son or daughter reach their full potential as a Star Kid. In this chapter we ill examine a number of these ways. So, sit back, take a deep breath, and relax. You and your Star Kid will do just fine. One of the first things that a parent of a Star Kid needs to do is settle into the Star Visitor reality yourself. For those parents who have not had a personal experience with a UFO sighting, or a close encounter with a Star Visitor, these parents will need to do a good amount of selfeducation. It is a general rule of parenting that you are going to be much more effective if you are equipped and prepare yourself for the job. Unfortunately, it has not been easy to get a good, solid, reliable education about the UFO phenomenon and Star Visitor contact. This whole subject has been subjected to the largest, longest, most prodigiously-financed cover-up in human history. Not only have the wraps been thrown over the subject, but there has been an enormous amount of deliberately-false and distorted stories put out to the public through magazine articles, books, newspaper stories, television programs and Hollywood movies, as well as the planting of lying lectures and “UFO experts” at UFO conferences and club meetings. So, how is a parent to know whom to believe and what to believe? The people operating the UFO Cover-Up operation have over the last few decades pretty much given up on the idea of trying to convince the public that UFOs don’t exist. There are now simply too many credible reports for that to work much any more. So instead, the operatives of the Cabal behind the UFO Cover-Up have focused their efforts on trying to “spin” the
150



phenomenon. Their fear-propaganda line “spin” is that, okay, so maybe the Star Visitors are real, but they are “evil, mean invaders”. So, one way for a parent to cut through the sea of such disinformation and fear-based propaganda is to analyze whether a given UFO presentation is trying to convey the false impression that the Star Visitors are evil or mean or invaders. If it is, then you are looking at or hearing false propaganda. How do you know it’s false? Because the information in Chapter Seven laid out the thorough, extensive professional research findings about who the Star Visitors really are and why they have decided to be present here now. A parent can educate themself with the other genuine valid information which is also available. A number of former military, intelligence, government and government contractor persons have decided to go public with what they know from their former positions within “sensitive” projects. These genuine, well-motivated, public-spirited government insiders include: US Air Force Colonel Wendelle Stevens; Site S-4 (Nellis Air Force Base) physicist Robert Lazar; team leader of the National Security Council’s Special Studies Group (tasked to manage Star Visitor information), Colonel Michael Wolf Kruvant, MD, Ph.D., Sc.D.; US Air Force leader of Project Pounce, Colonel Steve Wilson; US Army Command Sergeant-Major Robert O. Dean; US Air Force/National Security Agency Tech Sergeant Dan Sherman; US Army Staff Sergeant Clifford Stone; NASA Cape Canaveral Shuttle Launch Officer Clark McClelland; and NASA Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell. There are a number also of truthful civilian behavioral science research professionals who have amassed substantial information about the Star Visitors from working professionally with experiencers of contacts with these Visitors. As a result of such professional interviews, counseling, hypnotic examinations, and informational exchanges at professional meetings, these therapists and other behavioral-science professionals are in a position to set forth their findings about the Star Visitors, and have done so in lectures, articles and books. These genuine, truthtelling professionals include: University of Wyoming emeritus Psychology Professor R. Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D., the late Harvard University Psychiatry Professor John Mack, former Acting Surgeon-General of Finland Rauni-Leena Luukanen-Kilde, MD, Dr. Gilda Barbosa de Moura, former National University Psychology Department Chairman and California State University, Sacramento Lecturer Richard J. Boylan, Ph.D. (the author), and the following additional psychotherapist-researchers: Dr. Ruth Hover, Ph.D., LCSW, Barbara Lamb, M.S., LMFT, Mary Rodwell, RN, the late Constance Clear, LCSW, Gloria Hawker, CHT, Marian MacNeil, CHT, and scores of other clinicians of the Academy of Clinical Close Encounter Therapists, Inc. and others. These individuals have the advanced education, clinical training, experience and skills to differentiate truth from lying or delusion, to interview experiencers and obtain accurate information without distorting, or leading the witness, or imposing their own views on the client. Parents can take the findings of these professionals to the bank. And they unanimously find no evidence for the “evil mean invader” propaganda scenario painted by the disinformation artists planted throughout the ufology field. Such planted operatives are working secretly for the Cabal conducting the UFO CoverUp, and some of them are misusing their former history of government service to appear qualified when they spin their propaganda tales of fear. Again, “By their fruits shall you know them.” If the source you read/hear is peddling anti-“alien” fear, think: disinformation. There is an additional factor complicating the task of a parent educating themself about Star Visitor reality. This third factor is the considerable number of self-appointed and unqualified
151



civilian “UFO experts”, as well as metaphysical “channelers” of loquacious supposed “star beings”. The self-appointed civilian “experts” are fairly easy to evaluate. Their information is as good as their research professionalism and technique. You just don’t go into a phone booth and come out a “UFO expert”, much less competent to deal with the psychological variables of professional consultation with persons who report an encounter with a Star Visitor. It takes formal clinical education, training and experience in research methodology to do reliable, expert research you can trust. And good research takes patient, hard, and often long work. In the domain of experiencer encounters, only behavioral scientist professionals have the training and professional skills to work with such experiencers without traumatizing them, or causing distortion in the experiencer’s recall by injecting interviewer bias. This is specially important when hypnosis is utilized to assist recall of events stored in subconscious memory. The above extended critique was necessary because so many amateurs operate in this field, either blissfully ignorant of what they do not know, or egotistical enough to assume a competency that they are too often lacking. And these amateurs generate a disproportionate amount of the reports that the public sees. The “channelers” are a more difficult “briar patch”. In brief, there are genuine channelers and fake or self-deluded “channelers”. The genuine channelers are picking up on messages and information from a person not present in the flesh. The communication source may be a deceased human, a human physically located at a distance, a disincarnate spirit, or, of relevance to us, an actual Star Visitor. Just because a “channeler” claims that she is bringing through a message from some “star commander” doesn’t mean that it is true. She could be bringing through: her playful dead aunt who is into mediumship, a Brazilian Santeria spiritualist who is sending out thoughts about the star beings, a lower-level consciousness floating in the cosmic void that feels like messing with this Earthling’s mind, or whatever. Discerning a genuine channel of Star Visitor information, (yes, there are a few), is a science and an art. One criterion of genuineness is the humility and self-effacement of the person serving as the channel. Another criterion is the factor that Star Visitors are not at any human’s back and call. A genuine channel is not a Star Visitor ATM. Yet another criterion is money. Be wary of “channels” who want money for supposedly conveying Star Visitor messages. Real channels understand that they are of service. Yet another way to discern is the content of the supposed Star Visitor message. Is the language frank, direct, focused on the information to be conveyed, implicitly humble, and concerned about Earth’s wellbeing? These are attributes of genuine Star Visitor messages. The false channelings tend often to be in language that is Baroque (if not Rococco), or florid, or New Age-y pseudo-spiritual, wordy, circum-loquacious, vague, more pep-talk than information-laden; and tends to identify the supposed Star Visitor by names drawn from GrecoRoman mythology, science-fiction novels, supposed archangelic choirs, or male-believe extraterrestrial governmental organizations such as the ubiquitous but spurious “Ashtar Command”. Genuine Star Visitor communication tends to be to-the-point, compact, focused about important matters (as distinguished from self-importance - a sure sign of false “channeling”), matter-of-fact, delivered with generosity of spirit, with more of a Taoist or Zen-like flavor than the judgmental moralisms and theatricality of false channels. Despite the deliberately-sown mine field of disinformation and quackery, there are
152



enough real resources out there to enable any parent of good will and motivation to educate themself and their Star Kid enough to have well acquitted themself of their responsibility to be not only a good parent, but a tutor in the transition from Fourth World to Fifth World. At the risk of immodesty, I can identify one such unimpeachable source of good, free, disinformation-free data as being my website: www.drboylan.com . Parents should read it all to comprehensively educate themselves to be of maximum help to their growing Star Kid. Other good sources are the following websites: researcher Paola Harris’s http://utenti.lycos.it/paolaharris/english.htm , Star Seed therapist Mary Rodwell, RN’s http://members.iinet.net.au/~starline/index.html , and investigator Lars Bramers’s http://www.swa-home.de . In Appendix B of this book parents may find additional informational resources.
Do’s And Don’ts Of Parenting A Star Kid
Now to get down to some specifics of parenting your Star Kids. One task of the parent of a Star Kid is to inform yourself about the various characteristics and gifts of Star Kids. Some special abilities are hard to miss - like telekinesis or levitation. Others are more subtle. The point of a parent knowing the various potential abilities Star Kids may have is to be aware when your Star Kid begins to manifest such an ability. Realize, however, that each Star Kid will not manifest all the special abilities. And it is certainly to be avoided to be a Star Kid “Stage Mother”, trying to push your child into displaying abilities which they may not have, or may not have developed yet. Another task of a Star Kid parent is to get clear about whether you yourself are a Star Seed adult. Mind you, it is not necessary that you be a Star Seed adult in order to rear a Star Kid properly. But it is quite helpful to be quite clear about whether you are a Star Seed or not. If you are great! Then you have insider insight into the special world your Star Kid must navigate. Your gifts will enable you to better educate your Star Kid in the exercise of his or her abilities. And, you will serve as a role model to your Star Kid. If you are not an adult Star Seed, you can still do a fine job of parenting your Star Kid. What they need the most from you, you can give anyway: acceptance, understanding, encouragement, protective watchfulness, and readiness to grow and learn along with them. As a parent one of the things you can give your Star Kid is something which every parent should give their child, but which too many parents do not. The reality of the metaphysical and psychic realms is an important insight for your child. If he or she is a Star Kid, it is especially important that they have validation from you about these realms, particularly since the dominant culture tends to question or ridicule these areas of reality – areas in which your child will have important life experiences. It should go without saying that the parent of a Star Kid needs to endorse the reality of Star Visitor contacts which a child may have. And a parent needs to provide reassurance, especially to a small child, about Star Visitor contacts. The very young ones may misunderstand Star Visitor bedroom visits as “ghosts” or “goblins”, etc. You as a parent can help the child accept the Visitors calmly and matter-of-factly, perhaps by saying something along the lines of: “Some children are fortunate enough to have special Visitors from the stars at night.” Thus, you can help our child look forward to these encounters as interesting and helpful. It is decidedly unhelpful to try to dissemble genuine Star Visitor contacts as “the tooth fairy” or “just a dream”. Star Kids need to learn early that a good percentage of the productive
153



time they spend is not only during waking hours, but also during the night when it seems that they are just sleeping. Out-of-body experiences, nighttime encounters, and downloading of important information into the child’s mind during rest are only some of the significant activities which can take place at night. A parent needs also not to underestimate their Star Kid. With some Star Kids this may seem hard to do. Certain Star Kids are so dazzling in their psychic abilities that underestimating them never comes to a parent’s mind. But other parents may find their Star Kid low-keyed about any abilities they have, and shy or reluctant to share what they can do. A proper parental attitude is to be open and alert to indications about your child’s abilities, but not pushy or invasive or inquisitorial about what the child can do. If your Star Kid is secure and snug in their relationship with you the parent, they will let you know what they can do in the proper time. The child’s own appropriate pride and desire to share will work their usual magic. A great help you can give your Star Kid is to expose them to other Star Kids. There is an intrinsic comraderie that animates Star Kids who have an opportunity to meet and mingle with each other. Star Kids benefit greatly from meeting other Star Kids, hearing from them, and seeing them in action. Star Kids form mutual role models for each other. Note, however, that just because two children are Star Kids does not guarantee that they will hit it off with each other. It is more likely, because of the Star Kid bond. But it is not guaranteed. Human factors like personality mesh, tempo, respective maturational development, and other intangible “chemistry” factors exist in the real world of Star Kids as with children everywhere. As with any child, a parent does well to feed the mind of a Star Kid with good literature. But in the case of a Star Kid, “literature” takes on a special meaning. Besides the educational and cultural classics that all children can benefit from, a Star Kid parent does well to expose her child to specialized literature on psychic abilities, and genuine information on Star Kids. Appendix C of this book contains some suggested such readings. When it comes to getting toys for your Star Kid, shop thoughtfully for the kind of play objects which help him or her grow in their advanced awareness and their special gifts. Many parents select the kinds of toys for their children which help promote their mental development through basic skills like matching shapes or increasing the facility of eye-hand coordination. But the parents of a Star Kid would do well to select play objects that foster development of psychic abilities, too. To be sure, in today’s world, it is not readily possible to go down to Toys-R-Us and pull a psychic-development toy off the shelf. But with some ingenuity, it is possible to upgrade certain games into ones which help grow the Star Kid’s advanced abilities. Even such mundane things as a deck of playing cards can be turned into a “clairvoyant deck”, where the game is to “see” what the next face-down card will be when it is turned over. Or one of those small, light boats that are supposed to be propelled across a basin of water by introducing into its propulsion chamber a mixture of baking soda and vinegar, to give it fizz power. Instead, your Star Kid can be invited to play with making the boat move across the water without the fizz mixture, by mental concentration only. An excellent example of a Star Kids game is the martial arts game arena called DragonSport©. DragonSport is based on the martial art Jojutsu, used by Japanese warriors who armed themselves only with a short stick. This game is like the training sport in the Star Wars movie, where Luke Skywalker had practice at striking levitating energy orbs with his light sabre before they dodged and sent out a punishing electrical bolt. Inventors Alysn Hassenforder and Paul Russell of Glenwood Springs, Colorado describe DragonSport© this way. The player stands in the middle of a small arena surrounded by three
154



pillars. The pillars take turns lighting up briefly in a random sequence. The challenge is to tap one of the pillars with a baton when it lights up briefly before it goes out. As the player develops skill, the pace of the lighting-up is quickened and the duration of the lit pillar is shortened. Alysn says that she can tell the Star Kids, because after they get bored with the quickened pace, they graduate to wanting to play blindfolded! You can learn more about DragonSport© at www.dragonsport.com . The secret here in parenting and toy choices is to keep these toys as play and not to turn them into work. When you are a Star Kid, developing these abilities should be fun. There will be plenty of time later for working with these gifts in a highly-disciplined, practice-intensive way. Star Kids like to socialize with other Star Kids, and they need this socialization, even though a Star Kid may not know this at a given time, particularly if they have not been previously exposed to an “Awake” Star Kid. A thoughtful parent will recognize this need, and create such socialization opportunities. How does a parent find other Star Kids? In some cases your Star Kid is already aware of other similar such children at school, or somewhere in the neighborhood, even though the Star Kid may not label them as such. In other cases an enterprising parent may need to “advertise” for other Star Kids by putting a low-key “ad” or notice in their parent organization newsletter, or putting out the word at parent gatherings, that they would like to talk with other parents who notice unusual mental or psychic abilities in their child, and to “compare notes”. Parents of Star Kids can create socialization opportunities by starting a Star Kid play group, something like a baby-sitting cooperative, where parents take turns hosting such gatherings, or leading field trips to fun, educational places, or even locales of special power. Any good parent gives attention to their child’s spiritual development. With a Star Kid, it is important to let your child develop a spirituality which has integrity for your child. In many cases a Star Kid will already have an implicit spiritual orientation, even though, depending on their age, they may not have articulated it or organized it yet. In such situations the parent’s role is not to interfere with such choices, but rather to gently foster such self-development. In other cases the parent can make a contribution by leading by example, such as by observing a time for meditation, or by doing some Earth energy work where your child can observe this, or even be invited to join in. And depending on circumstances, a parent can share with their child some readings from spiritual and metaphysical classics, such as: Lao Tzu’s Tao Te Ching, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin’s The Phenomenon of Man, Jesus’s Sermon On the Mount, Frank Water’s The Book of the Hopi, Fritjof Capra’s The Tao of Physics, and Philip Kapleau Roshi’s The Three Pillars of Zen.
Any good parent spends some time looking for good external role models for their children. With Star Kids, this need for appropriate role models is especially important during these critical transition times between materialistic, outgoing Fourth World society and incoming, cosmic-minded Fifth World society. Children generally benefit from a mix of adult role models and role-model children somewhat older than themselves or their own age. As the few adult Star Seeds, including celebrities, who have come out of the closet publicly about their Star Visitor contact are joined by yet more, and as even Star Kids begin to declare themselves publicly in radio, newspaper and television interviews, there will be additional role models for Star Kids. As with any role model, the parent will want to place emphasis on the exemplary behavior of the role model, and put into proper context any human failings the Star Seed or Star Kid has. Likewise, parents will want to avoid placing over-emphasis on the fame aspect of any celebrities who come out. And as the Star
155



Kid (and adult Star Seed) phenomenon becomes widely recognized and accepted in society, it will become even easier to find other, more accessible role models in one’s own community. Being a Star Kid in contemporary society is not guaranteed to be easy. Therefore, many parents will find it necessary to advocate for their Star Kid at school and in group organizations like Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts. Other children are quick to notice differences in a child, and children sometimes are not very kind in the way they comment on, or deal with, those noticed differences. So, sometimes parental advocacy will take the form of talking with the teacher or group leader about making sure that your Star Kid is not picked on, socially ostracized, or made the butt of jokes. Star Kids have rights, too. In other cases advocacy may take the form of persuading school officials to create a special curriculum for your Star Kid and the other Star Kids in the school. Existing U.S. law requires the school to give your child an “appropriate education” which attends to the child’s “special needs”. While this legislation has been used in the past to assist parents of children with handicaps to get proper schooling, the parents of today’s Star Kids are going to need to band together and militate for curriculum reform and appropriate curriculum for their Star Kids. It may become useful to break new ground in utilizing tools like the Individualized Educational Plan (IEP), which requires the school to develop a plan that actually works to meet your child’s “special educational needs”. Parents can use the child’s entitlement by law to a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) to insist that the school accommodate to his “disability” of trying to operate as a Star Kid in a learning environment (classroom) designed for regular human children. Parents may try using the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to advocate for “special accommodation” to their child’s different learning styles. They may use the No Child Left Behind Act to argue for legally-required education strategies that work for their Star Kid. Parents can get tough and cite Section 504, a civil rights act which prohibits discrimination against a child with different learning needs. As a former school principal, I can assure you that most schools are not going to do it for you automatically. On the other hand, most educational advancement has come from parents exercising their influence to make sure that school works for their child, and that the child does not become bored and drop out due to the school’s irrelevance. Similarly, parent power is needed to wake up youth group leaders that the same old activities of teaching kids to tie square knots, or flower arranging, is not going to be responsive to who today’s Star Kids are. Organizations change when parents make no other alternative feasible, and when parents pitch in to help create the changes needed. A don’t for parents of Star Kids. Don’t let your child’s school or pediatrician mislabel him or her as having Attention-Deficit Disorder (ADD), Hyperactivity Disorder (HD), a Learning Disorder (LD), Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), Autism, or another mental problem or psychiatric condition just because your child is a Star Kid. Being a Star Kid is not a disease. A lot of the mislabeling comes from ignorance and fear of someone different. Can a Ph.D. psychologist be ignorant? Yes, if I has to do with the Star Kid phenomenon, and the psychologist has not educated him/herself about it. Can an MD psychiatrist or pediatrician be mistaken? Yes, if it has to do with looking at the different behaviors or mental profile of a Star Kid, and deciding that those “exotic” behaviors sound like some aberration they learned about in medical school. Are there Star Kids who also happen to have dyslexia, or childhood schizophrenia, or behavioral tics? Yes. But most Star Kids do not suffer from Attention Deficit Disorder, (contrary
156



to some of the urban myths which can be found on the Internet or in certain books.) If a Star Kid is having trouble paying attention in school, it is much more likely to have to do with the fact that the teacher or the subject material is so plodding, or so obvious, or so irrelevant, or so wrong, that the child cannot be reasonably be expected to pay continual attention to such a dysfunctional presentation. If a Star Kid seems restless much of the time, it is more likely to be the case that they find their learning environment boring or non-stimulating. Put a race horse in a tightly-confining stall and yes, he’ll kick out the boards and run free. If you as a parent suspects that your Star Kid is being mislabeled, arm yourself with information and advocate for your child. Information about genuine diagnostic criteria for ADD, HD, LD, DID, etc. is found in the DSM-4, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The DSM-4 is available in libraries and on the Internet’s World-Wide Web. The Academy of Clinical Close Encounter Therapists, Inc. has member therapists in almost every state and some foreign countries, who are aware of the transformations that people undergo as a result of Star Visitor contact. These therapists can provide professional consultation about your child’s basic psychological normalcy within the context of his being a Star Kid. Earlier we spoke about your Star Kid’s spirituality. Hand-in-hand with promoting your Star Kid’s developing their own spirituality is a parent’s role in providing your Star Kid with a good moral education. Certain fundamental values are honored across cultures, and can safely be assumed to be a universal part of healthy human consciousness. These include such things as truthfulness in one’s dealings with others, reasonable respect for another’s property, and avoiding violent behaviors in daily situations. An excellent primer on moral values is to be found in the United Nations Declaration of Universal Human Rights. This may be found at: http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html And of course along with rights come responsibilities. Parents can help their Star Kid hone his/her sense of moral responsibility by setting a good example, and by pointing out and endorsing examples of good moral responsibility-taking that occur in the community. Examples of such would include taking your Star Kid along with you when you work on a drive to collect clothing and supplies for earthquake victims, or showing up at a City Council meeting to support more low-income housing being made available in your community. A thoughtful parent also attunes to their Star Kid’s need for an “integrated” environment. Here what is being referred to is helping create a personal “world” for your Star Kid where there is room for their special abilities and awarenesses to be recognized, validated, and grow, while at the same time trying to weave all that as seamlessly as possible into the more ordinary and mundane elements of daily living, such as taking out the trash, or going swimming. When the Star Kid feels like there is a smooth flow between the world of psychic gifts in operation and ordinary daily living, then the parent has succeeded in reducing the risk that the Star Kid will see himself as a freak or an oddball. On the other hand, a good parent will see to it that their Star Kid has those specialized developmental experiences that provide special learning, skill development, and growth in awareness. Obvious examples of such specialized experiences are a Star Kids Project© Workshop or the Star Kids Project Summer Camp. Being a Star Kid should not be allowed to become all work and no play. Part of being a well-rounded parent of a Star Kid is organizing an occasional Star Kids party. What goes on at Star kids parties? Well, a good few rounds of DragonSport© certainly has it all over a game of Pin the Tail On the Donkey. But in a pinch, a parent on a budget might update this old
157



blindfolded challenge by introducing a timing element, since many Star Kids are going to be able to “sense” where the poster donkey is in the first place, using clairvoyance. And instead of bobbing for apples, a contest could be made over making an apple move across the bucket. Your Star Kids can come up with other ideas, too. As Star Kids move into the dating years, the thoughtful parent will foster their Star Kid’s developing friendships with other Star Kids. Most relationships work out better where the partners are more closely matched in certain critical areas. And certainly the ability of the potential future partner to share your Star Kid’s advanced world is one such critical element. Parents are aware that from dating eventually ensue their future son-in-law or daughter-in-law. And future grandchildren are much more likely to be Star Kids with both of their parents being Star Seeds. Start early to teach your Star Kid the New Facts of Life. These New Facts of Life which have important relevance for your Star Kid include the following: 1) the existence of a highlyorganized, politically-powerful and well-financed UFO Cover-Up; 2) the concomitant ridicule of and suppression of genuine information about the contact of Star Visitors with people on Earth; and 3) the black-out of information about the emerging Star Kids phenomenon. Your Star Kid does best to hear these New Facts of Life from their parent, and not to have to learn it on street corners. An additional Fact of Life for your Star Kid is possible seduction to join, or kidnapping by, operatives of the Cabal which also orchestrates the UFO Cover-Up. The Cabal is interested in these “psi children”, and seeks to try to convince them to come work for the Cabal, (which disguises itself as legitimate branches of government or think tanks or other civilian contractors with ties to military or intelligence units.) Where persuasion has not been successful, kidnapings have sometimes occurred. While a parent does not want to make their Star Kid paranoid, nevertheless, inculcating a certain amount of prudent awareness and circumspection certainly gives your child a heads-up on possible future pitfalls. As your Star Kid grows older, they will naturally want more privacy about their life, personal space and possessions. A good parent respects their growing child’s need for privacy. After all, this is one of the tools by which a child learns to define him or herself as separate and distinct from their parents. And yet a parent cannot totally tune out as to what their child is up to. A prudent general awareness is certainly in order. And if tell-tale warning signs emerge of likely drug use, planned dating of someone met on the Internet, etc., the prudent parent will step forard and tell their Star Kid that it is time to talk and share what’s going on, with the parent laying out openly what is their basis for concern. Let your Star Kid get as much education as they want and need. It may be for many Star Kids that it is only in a decent college or graduate school that the Star Kid finds for the first time in their life an arena of formal education which does not insult their intelligence. Put in more positive terms, the more open learning structure of universities and graduate schools, with their cafeteria of subject choices and difficulty levels, allows the Star Kid to be all that she or he can be. This is not to say that there are not some colleges which are woefully unprepared to meet the needs of a Star Kid. But a resourceful Star Kid has a better chance at the university or graduate school level to fashion the comprehensive education needed for preparation for life and mission. Help your Star Kid think about career choices that are compatible with the Star Kid’s identity and particular array of special abilities. But the parent must also help the Star Kid recognize that they have to distinguish in many cases between the work that is going to constitute the Star Kid’s “day job” and the activity which will be the Star Kid’s particular mission in this
158



lifetime. Especially during this time of awkward transition from limited Fourth World society to dawning Fifth World society, it is not going to be possible for all the Star Kids to make their living doing their special abilities or following their particular mission. It is especially helpful if the parent can validate by their own example the walking-two-trails approach of doing their “day job”, while making time elsewhere to gift society with their special abilities. And last but not least, look forward as a hard-working parent to the joys of watching a new crop of Star Kids come in who will be your grandchildren. If the current generation of Star Kids is any indication, the new crop will be even more spectacular than their parents were in their consciousness, awareness, abilities and largeness of heart. May we all live to see that grand time.

Chapter 13
Proper Education For Star Kids
Specialized Education For Star Kids
What is Star Kid education? What kind of education do Star Kids need? Do Star Kids even need education? Some people are so impressed by the high intelligence, sensitivity, warm empathy, and dazzling psychic abilities of these Star Kids that they feel the best thing that society can do is stay out of their way; that society has nothing to teach these superkids. But this would be too facile and not correct. Star Kids do not come “out of the box” fully formed and ready for life’s tasks. Both the laws of nature on Earth, and the laws of a gradual developmental unfolding that govern their genes derived from elsewhere in the cosmos, both dictate that the Star Kid starts off small, with only basic information and fundamental skills, and needs to develop through time, experience, nurture, education and training to reach full potential as a hybrid wunderkind. Though it may seem that these advanced children are beyond the point where contemporary society has anything to teach them, they still need, and benefit from, appropriate education. Star Kid-specific education helps develop these children’s minds. It contributes to the honing of their moral compass. Such education teaches them the heart skills of operating with compassion and loving wisely, yet without being victimized by the predators who abound too much in the present Fourth World. Star Kid-specific education instructs these youngsters in how to use heir exquisite sensitivity to optimal benefit without being imploded by sensory overload, for example, from being in the jangling, discordant and jungle-thick discordant mental, emotional and energetic fields of large crowds, or being in discordant cities, or even just being around bad-vibration people. Such Star Kid education teaches the proper use of empathy, and its limits. Such education shows these kids the wise and socially-beneficial utilization of their mental, physical and psychic abilities. Star Kid education respects and builds on the Star Kid’s connection to both the child’s Earth family and star family, and recognizes that many Star Kids operate in close psychic connection with their families. Star Kid-specific education also shows these youngsters to operate within the implied community of other Star Kids as well as Star Seed adults; because Star Kids need to learn to resist the temptation of being a Lone Wolf, a temptation born of feeling different, edginess or rejection by other kids, and the supercilious attitude of society. These children need direction to see that they are not lone operators, but rather part of a web of consciousness that springs from Earth as well as from home world elsewhere or in a previous lifetime. That they are imbedded in a web of consciousness that illumines, supports, and gives psychological shelter to these wunderkinder, as they seek their way, and strive to help the Earth, and make their contribution to society.

Education prepares the child for the future. But, who are the future? The future is the Star Kids growing up now, and the grown Star Seeds already in place in adult society. Let's just start out by talking about the situation from the perspective of being in America. From a global point of view, this is admittedly a regional scope, but chosen so that the subject becomes more manageable. But everything we say here is applicable in every region in the world. How can we help these Star Kids find their true identity and nature and purpose? Well, we've got a couple of ideas going. Creating Star Kids School, for instance. This concept was handed down by the Star Visitors to my friend and buddy, Russ Winje, up in Northern California when I was visiting him, doing a workshop there. He had received an indication from some Star Visitors who showed up on the property during the Workshop. These Star Visitors indicated to Russ that he and I would have some role in helping set such Star Kid Schools up. And we're working on that. Such Star Kid Schools would include not only elementary-level schools, but also Star Kid Junior Highs (whew!) And also, instead of High Schools, Young-Adult Star Seed Schools, (a sort of combined high school-junior college) for these special young people who don't see themselves as little kids any more, but are still in that coming-into-their-full-adult-maturity stage. Also, there is so much variability in super-intelligence, maturational level, and interests at this age that strict categorization of these young people into rigid hierarchical grade levels seems unwise. Apropos of this latter level of learning, in the Fall of 2002, I did one of these Young Adult Star Seed Workshops down in Santa Cruz, California. It was an amazing experience. We had 20 people there who - many of them perhaps for the first time - were able to talk about their abilities, their awarenesses, and to be in a room where they weren't the oddball, but were surrounded by everybody else who was the same. Can you imagine what an experience that is for a kid? Suddenly, they're normal. They don't have to fight about shame, being in the closet, being worried about being an oddball. They're normal. That little room of folks was a microcosm of Fifth World cosmic society come alive. Those young people could relax and let down their guard, and not worry about social acceptance by society. What that Workshop environment did was to liberate them to say, "Well now, let's see what we do with this as a bunch of folks gathered." And I want to tell you that the minute everybody sat and introduced themselves - bang! Instant community. There was none of this awkwardness you get when you put a bunch of people together in a hotel ballroom nervously feeling each other out, deciding who you like and who you don't, who you can trust and who you can't. None of that. It was instant on. Many of you have experienced similar dynamics at an experiencers support group. Have you noticed how when you get in there, it feels kind of familiar, even though you haven't formally met the folks before? It's kind of like instant-on group community. Why does that happen? Well, one thing is that we are changed now. And we can spot a fellow experiencer across a crowded room. I don't know all the dynamics of why that is. I'm sure our telepathic awareness, and our intuitional awareness of folks that are vibrating on the same frequency of awareness, is being mutually picked up on. We can tell there's a fellow “vibrator” at that level in the room. I'm using crude vocabulary here, because the vocabulary has not really been developed yet. Maybe Dr. Leo Sprinkle can help us out, and some of the other long-time explorers of the psychic realm will help pitch in with some vocabulary. But those vibrations are there, those intuitive gifts to make that happen, so you have instant community. In virtually all cases, our current school system is not built particularly to prepare citizens

- our Star Kids - for cosmic society. But as Earth chooses cosmic society, it will change the curriculum of the schools to match that new agenda. But it occurs to me that at this point in our delicate transition we can't wait for a systematic change in the curriculum of the public school systems of this country and other countries, that we need something in the meantime. I borrow here a page from the 1960s - which was our revolutionary little warm-up and dry-run, getting us ready for the looming cosmic society that would start emerging 40 years later. One of the things that came up in the '60s for people involved in revolutionary change who didn't have time to wait for the school systems to catch up with it - was Freedom Schools. These Freedom Schools started in the U.S. South in oppressed Black communities, and in urban centers of the oppressed Black community (and later with other peoples of color), where the kids could go sometimes after school (later instead of school, depending on the degree of revolutionary consciousness), and get a quick orientation to Black history, culture, everything that was left out of the curriculum of the time. It's better now. You have to have lived for a length of time to remember how bad it was back then, when being Black meant, "Oh, your ancestors were slaves." We're now aware there's a lot more to African-American history and culture than just that. It was devastating to AfricanAmerican kids in those days to have their blackness consist of historical slavery, period. All the richness of the various African cultures, all the heroism of African slave leaders and liberators in America, all of the literature, art, trade craft, inventions and other cultural contributions of African-Americans had been ignored, or trivialized into: “Oh, yes, George Washington Carver found some new uses for the peanut.” What those African-American children needed instead, they got at Freedom Schools. They got proud affirmation of their identity. They came to learn that “Black is beautiful.” They got an educated critique of how the oppression of the dominant White culture had powerfully warped their perception of themselves. Things like trying to straighten their hair, and dye it blonde, and apply skin-whiteners to try to look White. Those children learned how oppression and the dominant-society culturally-imposed informational black-out on their ethnic identity and contributions distorted Black children’s self-perceptions. They learned the true history of their origins, in rich, ancient, mature, highly-civilized cultures from a continent, Africa, that was civilized when Europeans were still running around in animal skins with clubs. These Black children learned to take pride in their origin and their differentness and their diversity. These children learned how their history in America had been erased, submerged, trivialized, or distorted by the White writers of the history books used at school. They learned about the tools of economic exploitation used to keep African-Americans from access to the resources they needed to get ahead. They learned about the racist institutionalized social structures that excluded Blacks or marginalized their opportunities. They learned about American politics, and how it has worked to assure that the rich keep getting richer, and the poor keep getting poorer, because of manipulation of information, manipulation of political parties, and the dominance of candidate campaigns by the plutocratic and powerful establishment. And these Black kids learned about real heroes, Black heroes and heroines. Sure these children were already aware of a few prominent African-Americans, men or women who had made their mark in sports achievement or musical excellence, heroes like: Duke Ellington, Smokey Robinson, Mahalia Jackson, Ella Fitzgerald, Joe Frazier and Hank Aaron. But they also
162



learned about political and cultural leaders and Black Liberation heroes, whom White textbooks and newspapers had mis-branded as dangerous “insurrectionists”, “radicals” and “Communists”. These were true inspirational leaders, like: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Ralph Bunche, Malcolm X, the Greensboro Four, Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, Huey Newton, Booker T. Washington, and A. Philip Randolph. Let's borrow from that experience and create the “Freedom Schools” for the Cosmic Society, in other words, Star Kids Schools. We don't have time to wait for institutional change across the board in our public schools to get kids ready for cosmic society. Besides, some of the kids that really can't wait are our experiencer kids, our hybrid kids, our Star Kids. These superkids, if I may call them that, can't wait for society to move into the Fifth World and for us then to say, "Oh, by the way, we'd better change our school curriculum, because it doesn't fit this cosmic society any more." They're rocking the school systems now, in terms of who they are, what they are, and what they know, even though the perplexed teachers and school administrators don’t really know why there are so many of these “different” kids, nor what to do with them. We owe it to them to give them a better sense of their origins, their potential, and their abilities - to normalize all that and to give them a sense of their role in this transition to building cosmic society. So, let’s look at what the 1960s Freedom Schools had to face, and how they put together a relevant curriculum of change and consciousness-raising, and see what we can learn and adapt from those Freedom Schools to fashion today’s Star Kid Schools. Let’s be creative but focused. Like those Freedom Schools that started in oppressed Black communities, and in urban ghettos of the oppressed Black community, Star Kid Schools need to be started in various locations where Star Kids can readily get to them. At first this may be a humble location like a host-parent’s home, a free room temporarily borrowed at the local library, or a classroom rented after-hours at the local public school. The curriculum will need to be a combination of orientation to the Star Kid identity and experience, teaching about Star Kid consciousness, and creating an environment in which Star Kids can share with each other what they know, feel, and can do. The very creation of a Star Kids School environment powerfully says to these children that “you are recognized”, “you are honored”, “you matter”, “you’ve got allies”, and “you deserve to get the best possible foundation for being here and making the impacts that you will make.” Naturally, Star Kids Schools will have to teach the subject areas of such basics as reading, writing, mathematics, literature, science, social studies, art, music, physical education, and other foundational skills and knowledge. But these new schools will also teach subjects which have been revised and adapted to Star Kid realities. And new courses will have to be developed which have not generally previously occurred in Western schools. The principal subject areas that will need serious revision, as the reality of Star Nations contact is recognized, are: history, astronomy, anthropology, physics, and astrophysics. Courses which have generally not previously be included in childhood education include: psychic abilities, parapsychology, cosmic civilizations, inter-species communication, interstellar sociology and diplomacy, reincarnation, and cosmic spirituality, among others. At these Star Kids Schools, the children will get an orientation to the background history of Star Seeds and Star Kids, and how and why our Star Seed culture is being left out of the curriculum being taught in regular schools. Star Kids Schools will provide an orientation to the big picture of Star Visitor contact and
163



engagement with Earth, including a revised history of humankind, which will include the Star Visitors’ role in bioengineering humankind over successive stages of anthropological development, a process that conventional history books ascribe to “evolution”. Star Kid-specific school will teach a revised modern history as well. Rather than skipping over the initial contacts of the Star Visitors in recent times, such major historical events as the first modern UFO sighting by sheriff’s deputy and civilian pilot Kenneth Arnold in June of 1947, the Roswell (Corona) Crash of July, 1947, and the nightly UFO overflights of the Washington, DC capital in July, 1952 will find their rightful place in history not as “urban legends” or “curiosities”, but as an early and important part of the recent unfolding engagement of nations from the stars with the people of Earth. Just as in Black Freedom Schools, African-American heroes suddenly reemerged and took their rightful place in the history books, so also the brave pioneers who dared public scorn to enunciate the truth of cosmic cultures in contact with Earth will be named and honored. The Star Kids will learn about and develop respect for important historical figures in the saga of humankind starting to come to terms with cosmic contact, such as: Kenneth Arnold, Army Air Corps Lt. Col. Jesse Marcel, George Van Tassel, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle, USMC Major Donald Keyhoe, US Army Col. Philip Corso, US Army Command Sgt.Major Bob Dean, Betty and Barney Hill, Travis Walton, Robert Lazar, and Dr. John Mack. Like the Black Liberationists of yore, many of these pioneers have had to endure taunts, persecution, and personal attacks. Their courage and steadfastness of testimony in the face of the most withering fire that the Cabal propagandists and dirty-tricks operatives could muster merit each of these heroes memorialization in timeless granite, and in the revised histories of our time. In Star Kids Schools the children will learn that their true origins are from among the stars. They will learn about highly-civilized cultures who came down all around the globe in prehistorical times and taught primitive humans the rudiments of culture. The children will be taught to take pride in their bi-cultural heritages, in their differentness and diversities, as Earthlings and as persons which heritage from various star systems. Star Kids will be taught how the history of star civilizations’ contact with Earth has been purged from history books, misinterpreted or twisted by religious organizations, and sequestered and monopolized by secret societies for purposes of concentrating power in the hands of a few. And how the bonanza of Star Visitor technology that became available after the Roswell crash was classified and monopolized and “weaponized” by greedy defense contractor corporations instead of made available in its original nonviolent form for the general benefit of the population. These youngsters will learn about predatory institutionalized covert compartments within NASA and the National Reconnaissance Organization who seek to gain supremacy for their Cabal masters by recruiting, seducing, parent-bribing, or kidnaping young advanced children, and extracting from them the secrets of how and why they have their extraordinary powers. They will learn about the systematic manipulation of radio, television, movies, the press, institutions of higher learning, and professional organizations to repress, discredit or deny the legitimacy of accounts of close encounters with the Star Visitors, the reality of psychic abilities, and the thousands of existing credible and significant reports about messages from the Star Nations in contact with Earth, particularly those urgent reports of the past fifty years. The children will learn about American politics, and how it has worked to assure that the rich keep getting richer, and the poor keep getting poorer, because of manipulation of Star Visitor contact information, manipulation of public perception of apparent technological progress versus actual, astronomical advances in the “black projects” world, and the infiltration
164



of and dominance of civilian organizations nominally concerned with UFO matters by agents of the plutocratic and powerful establishment who seek to maintain world domination by keeping access to Star Visitor information monopolized by the “elite” few. Some might argue that teaching young impressionable children about such harsh and ugly matters is not right. But certainly what is not right is to perpetuate an “ostrich” culture of maintaining society’s head in the sand about the awful abuses and wrongful stealing of our true history and the delay of our social progress, so that a selfish and sociopathic few could enrich and aggrandize themselves at the expense of the human race. Star Kid Schools will be places where these physical and psychic hybrids can receive proud affirmation of their identity. They can come to affirm that “Being a Star Kid is beautiful.” They can get an educated critique of how the oppression of the dominant Cabal power structure’s debunkery and media ridicule has powerfully warped their perception of themselves.. Those children will learn how oppression and the dominant-society culturally-imposed informational black-out about their special identity and about past unrecognized Star Seed contributions have distorted Star Kids’ self-perceptions. As the corrective experience of going to school in an environment that affirms them, encourages everything they are, and teaches them how to make a powerful difference in society sinks in, Star Kids will no longer feel the need to try to pass themselves off as “just regular humans”; just as Black Liberation children decades ago learned that there no longer was any need to act like, or pass themselves off as, White.
Indigenous Child Education and What It Can Teach Us
Recently, the tremendously-powerful movie, Whale Rider enjoyed a wide audience. This poignant New Zealand film showed the story of an adolescent Maori girl, Pai, 12, and her struggles to not only affirm her own identity, but also to be accepted as the first female Maori hereditary chief. While the movie has a climactic scene in which Pai climbs aboard a swimming whale, the film does not show all of the sacred Maori coming-of-age ritual for initiates into the Maori higher teachings, including Star Visitor contact and lore. I had the privilege of meeting a Maori Elder, Macki Ruka, at Dakota (Sioux) Star AltarKeeper Chief Golden Eagle’s Star Knowledge Conference in the Pacific Northwest in the late 1990s, when Macki was on a global mission of peace. He had been sent out globally by the Maori Grandmothers [matrilineal tradition-keepers] to spread abroad their previously closelyheld traditions about the arrival of the Time of Transition and the Return of the Star Nations. At that Conference Macki taught us this important Maori spiritual information, and did powerful ceremony to bring Earth and humans into harmony with the prophesied flow of upcoming events. Later I received an email from an Australian informant, Carol, that notified us that outstanding Maori shaman Macki Ruka has passed. It is a loss of a great teacher and Maori Elder. Parenthetically, Dr. Michael Wolf of the U.S. National Security Council told me how the cetaceans (whales and dolphins) are an intelligent, telepathic extraterrestrial species, seeded here to assist humankind on rising to our own potential of intelligence and spirituality. It is therefore
165



telling that the Maori incorporate these ancient intelligent mammals from the stars into the education of Maori coming-of-age youngsters. And part of what the whales educate the Maori kids about is that these Star Kids have a link to the stars. The whales take the child riding on their back underwater. But the child does not drown, because the whale is careful to frequently exhale a large bubble of air, which the child sticks her head into and replenishes her air supply, so that she can stay on board the whale longer, and extend her telepathic educational lessons in the benthic deep. Carol writes about her parallel experience with Elder Ruka : "We did several ceremonies with Macki Ruka, a Maori Towhunga (medicine man) who had incredible power. He described his initiations to a group of us at a friend’s house one night, and the one with the whales was [so] true. He started his training as a medicine man at 3 years old, and by the age of 9 was already a full fledged medicine man, helping deliver babies and doing many of the ritual ceremonies with his people. “Just before he became a medicine man, they took the small group of them who had been trained by the Grandmothers (the Maori are a Matriarchal society) out into the ocean in the middle of the night in a boat, and when they were out of sight of land, they were thrown overboard. “He told us that they saw huge black shapes in the water, and that they were whales. He was very scared at first, but by that time could communicate with all of nature; and that the whales swam with them, and taught them. “He told of being taken deep into the ocean with the whales, and said he has had an affinity with them ever since. “Unfortunately, Macki passed [from] this plane a year ago, as he was in his late seventies when we met him. We learned a lot from him. We participated in the very first ceremony ever held outside the Maori community, the opening of the twelve gates of consciousness. There was one person for each of the twelve small bonfires that were lit in a circle. “Macki had a greenstone staff that was over three thousand years old that had never been touched by a man until it was given to him to travel the world with on a mission of world peace. “He held the staff aloft, made an arc from The Big Dipper across the sky, sang a Maori prayer, and a shooting star went across the sky exactly in the same arc as the staff. We were all standing there with our mouths open. [T]hen he performed the same prayer song to the other three directions, and each time, in the sky a shooting star followed his path. It was incredibly powerful, and when we had each performed our own prayer, each of us had to speak one [thing] for the gate we were the keeper of. [T]he energy that came around and through us was incredible. Macki definitely had the power of nature walking with him.” What can we learn from indigenous education about training Star Kids? One thing we can benefit from is the universal affirmation among all intact indigenous cultures around the world that their people’s cultural and physical origins have a relationship to the stars. In this broad global anthropological context, parents of Star Kids need not feel out on a limb or extreme in seeing to it that their Star Kids get an education with similar important content. Another correlate from indigenous teachings is the effort to connect children with Nature, particularly the sentient and telepathic parts of Nature, to aid in forming and shaping youthful consciousness. A third thing we can draw from the indigenous cultures is the importance they place on tradition. In indigenous cultures tradition is not just a custom handed down by several
166



generations, but rather a well-developed body of information and knowledge that derives its power from its having stood the test of time for millennia; and of being so important that no generation would think about failing to pass it on to the next generation. Certainly, messages from Visitors from the stars fall into such a category. And since such messages are a key to our complete and elevated self-understanding as a people, their importance dictates that they be included as part of essential adolescent education in preparation for taking on adult life.
The Structure of Star Kid Education
Education takes place differently at a Star Kids School. The teachers not only stand up at the front of the class, but are also sitting around in a circle with the children exchanging the information and experiences which each bring to share to enrich the common pool of knowledge, understanding and skills that are the patrimony of Star Kids. Since Star Kids differ individually in their level of intelligence, attunement, downloaded information, psychic abilities, etc., can it work out that Star Kids all learn at their own pace while in a group of students? Can it work out that Star Kid students keep up with their studies while they are traveling on educational field trips to national monuments, historical sites and other learning experiences? Can the teachers in a Star Kid School spend less time up in front of the class and more time working individually with each student, coaching, encouraging, affirming correct answers, and tutoring towards success in learning? Yes. How can this work out? Here is one way. The Star Kids School can adopt a series of age and grade levelappropriate correspondence-courses to form a quasi-self-tutorial form of individual study either in the classroom, or in the Star Kid’s home, or in a community-based youth study center. These correspondence courses will be individually paced, and feature clear, selfexplanatory didactic workbooks. A student takes one course at a time, completes and turns in the assignments, gets graded, and when passed, is promoted to the next subject. These correspondence course materials, originally designed for distance learning, do not assume a previous solid foundation in these subjects. So many Star Kids have been let down by schools and teachers who are no match for these new kids and their learning styles. Especially in the early years of the Transition from Fourth World to Fifth World, there will be Star Kids who tried to make it in regular public schools, had a poor experience, and now find themselves in the middle grades or older, lacking a number of fundamental skills, and having large holes in the subject knowledge they are “supposed to have” by the chronological age they are at. These new-approach study materials start with foundations missed in earlier grades, and rapidly accelerate through the workbook in stages up to even college-prep levels of presentation. Thus, apt students, like so many Star Kids are, can fill in the gaps in foundational learning, and then rapidly accelerate to the upper levels of secondary education, and from there prepare themselves for college and graduate schools. A particular example of this correspondence-course style, individually self-paced learning program is the Steck-Vaughn distance-learning Series. Subject areas covered include Social Studies, Science, Mathematics, Reading, Writing, and Human Relations. Interested Star
167



Kids and/or their parents can learn more about such materials by contacting, for example, the Steck-Vaughn Company, P.O. Box 26015, Austin, Texas 78755, USA. 1-800-531-5015. www.steck-vaughn.com [And no, I do not have a financial interest in this company, nor have I been compensated for my implied endorsement.] This is an example of an individualized learning tool which can be used in a group learning situation, where the teacher is more of an encourager, facilitator, and pacer. In such learning environments it is quite easy to “interrupt” such study in order to take the Star Kid students on travel for educational field trips to national monuments, historical sites and other learning experiences, or to exercise psychic powers doing healing work at an Earth power site, or a disaster location, or to develop outdoor skills in an Outward Bound kind of immersion experience. Such flexible, self-paced learning materials also facilitate the teachers in a Star Kid School spending less time up in front of the class, and more time working individually with each student, coaching, encouraging, affirming correct answers, and tutoring towards success in individualized yet group-collective learning.
Star Kid Workshop Report
Another way learning can occur is via a contained, specially-focused educational experience like a workshop, where specialist instructors come in to provide educational experiences not otherwise readily available. Here is a report of one such Star Kid Workshop. Note the different ways learning can take place in such an environment, and the dynamic energy generated by the interplay between participants.
Report on the Star Kids/Star Seeds Workshop Aug. 23-25, 2002, at The Integratron, CA
The site for the Star Kids/Seeds (1) Workshop was The Integratron, a two-story, gleaming-white domed structure resting on a broad round pedestal. In the 1950s, former Lockheed engineer and experiencer George Van Tassle was instructed by the Star Visitors to build this unusual building. It is entirely made of wood without a nail or any other metal used in its interior construction. Around the external lower edge of the second-story dome are affixed a series of metallic solid pipes, like a circular lightning-rod array. This configuration was designed to harness the ambient energy of the local Earth energy ley line upon which the Integratron sits. So powerful is the structure’s shaping field that a magnetic declination of five degrees occurs between 50 feet outside from the building versus inside the Integratron, as observed by this author. Further, the array of rods is designed to shape any lightning strikes into a hemisphere of energy which would harmlessly surround the Integratron and provide a beneficial energy field for those inside. The Integratron’s purpose was to be a center where people would come to receive an energy treatment which would forestall any ill effects of aging.
168



The gleaming white domed structure shone like a beacon in the brilliant sunlight of the cloudless blue sky and crystalline pure air of the high Mojave Desert, as the Star Kids and Star Seeds gathered that Friday afternoon of August 13, 2002 to begin this first official workshop of the Star Kids Project (2). As far as this author is aware, this gathering was an historic first: the premier public Workshop dedicated to acknowledging, educating, supporting and linking Star Kids. There in Landers, CA, thirty-four transformed or hybrid humans gathered to meet each other, share information, tell their visions, own and develop their paranormal skills, and become a bonded unit of the cosmic family. They were not disappointed.
It is more difficult to report on such a Workshop because, unlike a UFO conference, such a Star Kids/Star Seeds Workshop is more intimate and personal. Out of respect for the privacy of the participants, this report will discuss events without specific identifiers, except for the facilitators.
The workshop was led by Dr. Richard Boylan, noted researcher of Star Visitor-human encounters. Also assisting were co-facilitators Rev. Barbara Lindsey, internationally-noted psychic, healer and experiencer, and Marian MacNeil, CHT, psychic, experiencer and hypnotherapist. But in a real sense, all of the participants took initiative in contributing to the substance and dialogue of the Workshop. For, in the new social structure of Fifth World cosmic society, everyone bears responsibility for the social whole, and there are no elite leaders. And so it was at Landers.
Friday evening, the participants gathered in the Integratron dome. It was a time for introductions and sharing of where each participant came from. Dr. Boylan laid out the provisional agenda for the weekend. Each of the Star Kids/Seeds stated why they had come, and what they expected. The level of electric excitement and anticipation was very high.
Saturday morning the participants filed into the Integratron to begin the Workshop. Each participant went through a brief Native American purification ceremony, being smudged by smoke from a burning bundle of sage. The Workshop was videotaped by Raymond (3), a 10year-old Star Kid, who also offered computer programming advice to Dr. Boylan.
Dr. Boylan began the Workshop by discussing what makes Star Kids and Star Seeds different. He spoke of the special transformation of these starfolk, whether by alteration during an encounter with the Star Visitors, or by their parents’ reproductive material having been upgraded during a Visitor contact. He outlined some of the physical differences that occur in Star Kids/Seeds after contact: improvement in the immunity system, with fewer and milder illnesses, lower basal temperature (so that the body does not burn out as fast), and dynamic energetic appearance (Star Kids), or looking younger than one’s age (Star Seeds).
Dr. Boylan also described some of the psychic changes noted in starfolk: telepathy, precognition, telekinesis, clairvoyance/remote viewing, “downloading” information telepathically from Star Visitor sources, cross-species communication (e.g., telepathically understanding and conversing with animals), penetrating intuitiveness (knowing something about a person or situation without knowing where the information was acquired), affecting electrical devices (such as remotely turning on or off lights), remote-influencing others, inter-dimensional viewing, aura- reading, psychic diagnosis, bioenergetic healing, and connecting with one’s StarVisitor and other guardians telepathically or during astral (out of body) travel. The Star Kids and Star Seeds chimed in with their own examples of these abilities as experienced in their lives.
He also spoke of the spiritual dimensions of the Star Kid/Star Seed experience. That it’s
169



not just about meeting exotic people or acquiring powers like the “X-Men”, but rather a lifting of our consciousness about the Supreme Source (God), and how that Source permeates everything and everyone, and how the cosmos is a sacred arena of possibilities in which we operate.
After that introduction, the Star Seeds and Star Kids took turns each relating briefly their own experiences of contact. Some, especially Star Kids, talked of encounters from an early age. Others described a gradual awareness later in life that they were Star Seed, and how it made them feel different and privileged. A number of entire families were present, Star Kids and parents.
The participants described coming to terms with various unusual abilities. In many cases their families were also experiencers, and so there was support and understanding for their specialness. In other cases the Star Seed had a more challenging time coming to accept their special identity without the support of their family, or even their scoffing.
A number of participants spoke of recognizing the others at this Workshop as somehow familiar, despite the fact that they were apparently meeting for the first time. “I’ve met you somewhere before,” was an expression more than one person said. And many repeated a refrain that the people at this Workshop felt like already-established or instant family.
During the catered lunch, the participants broke into little groups of new friends, trading personal stories, and sharing the excitement of being at this historical Workshop.
Saturday afternoon the co-facilitators, Barbara Lindsey and Marian MacNeil led special demonstrations and exercises to make the starfolk present aware of some of their latent abilities, or to give them an opportunity to exercise those they were already aware of.
Marian described the location and function of each of the seven chakras (special consciousness/energy centers) in the body, and taught how to cleanse them. She then led a guided meditation on a method of balancing each chakra.
Barbara taught about viewing auras, and what different aura “signatures” mean. For some of these exercises the participant was awakening abilities which had lain dormant. For others it was familiar and a chance to practice already-accepted powers.
Marian did a remote-viewing exercise, passing around a picture sealed in an envelope. She invited each Star Kid/Seed present to “read” what was inside. The “hit” rate was very high.
Another popular exercise had participants mingle and connect with each other participant, utilizing only telepathy. It went off well with many smiles and signs of understanding messages sent.
Because the day reached 98 degrees, a number of Star Kids and a few Star Seeds went into the Doughboy pool adjacent to the Integratron to cool off in water sports play.
At dinnertime, the Workshop broke off formally, to reconvene after dinner.
For the evening Skywatch, Barbara Lindsey led the group to a remote location in Joshua
170



Tree National Park, a few miles from the Integratron. There Dr. Boylan led the group in a joint telepathic outreach to the Star Visitors. Later one participant noticed a blue flash, as an object darted across the sky. Dr. Boylan also pointed out the several U.S. military secret antigravity craft flying high above. He identified the craft as the Lockheed X-22A, a two-man disc whose signature is a rapidly-blinking bluish-white light and a rapid trajectory, punctuated by dead stops mid-air, and reversals-in-track, as well as sideways instantaneous dislocations from its original linear trajectory.
Sunday started warm early, a sure sign that the day would reach 100 Fahrenheit despite the 4000-feet altitude.
Sunday morning, Workshop participants who so chose attended an early-morning Native American spiritual Star Elders ceremony in the underground kiva (4), also on the Integratron property. After traditional smudging of those in attendance, there was a period of meditation. Then Dr. Boylan did a sacred pipe prayer ceremony, asking the Spirits of the Six Directions to advance the Star Kids Project and all those attending the Workshop. He then told the story of the Blue Star Kachina: when she returned to dance in the plaza of a Hopi village, that would signal the end of the Fourth World and the return of the Star Elders. He then prayed for the return soon of the Blue Star Kachina.
Dr. Boylan also gave a talk explaining why Star Kids and Star Seeds are here in such abundance now. He described the “missionary incarnation” that these starfolk had agreed to before birth, volunteering to reincarnate this lifetime on Earth, to aid the planet’s inhabitants in this monumental Time of Transition from the present corrupt, hyper-materialistic, eco-cidal Fourth World to a cosmically-aware Fifth World society. Many of the other participants also said aloud their own prayers.
Next, Barbara led the participants in a caravan of cars to the Crystal Hill near Giant Rock, an old 1950s UFO landing site two miles north of the Integratron. Crystal Hill is a natural large formation of crystalline quartz, forming a eight-story-high mound of natural quartz, many of whose crystals lie loose atop. Barbara talked about the use of crystals as a natural amplifier of energy fields, including human. She also described their healing and visioning properties.
The starfolk then adjourned back to the Integratron for additional learning. Dr. Boylan utilized two 11-year-old twin Star Kids, Allen and Aaron, to demonstrate the use of a pendulum to access universal mind, and determine answers to questions. He also demonstrated psychic diagnosis, using a volunteer, Carrie. Passing his hand over her auric field, he detected two locations of health imbalance. Dr. Boylan then enlisted four volunteers with Therapeutic Touch training, Bente, Margo, Lisa and Belle, to assist him in doing a psychic healing. They used only the natural powers of the cosmos [Tunkashila, (Lakota for the Grandfather)] and of Mother Earth [Maka Unce, (Lakota for the Grandmother).] These powers were invoked and drawn through the practitioner, and sent via their palm chakra into the auric field and body of the one in need. Soon after, Carrie reported that she felt much better.

Marian had participants pair off and remote-view each other to get information about the other that the partner could then confirm. People were pleased with the accuracy of the information shared. Additional exercises included experiencing the Star Kid’s or Star Seed’s connection to Spirit. Because of the press of time, participants told about their experiences doing telekenesis, but did not actually demonstrate it within the Dome. Throughout the weekend, there was a shared sense by facilitators and participants that there was just not enough time to do everything that was potentially part of the Workshop. A future Workshop may eventually last for a week.
As part of the Closing Ceremony, each Star Kid and Star Seed told of what they had gotten from the Weekend. All were unanimous in saying that it was a most important event in their lives. Dr. Boylan indicated that this was but the first of a series of Star Kids/Star Seeds Workshops to be held across the country and internationally. He asked for members to keep aware if a financial angel could be identified to help with start-up funding for the Star Kids Project©.
Because many had to get back home for school or work, the Workshop formally ended early Sunday afternoon. A number of participants stayed on to get hypnotic regression by Dr. Boylan for Star Visitor encounters or astral experiences, or to get a psychic reading by Barbara Lindsey.
As the afternoon wore on, the last of the participants left for home. Each was changed by this weekend in ways they would process for weeks to come.

End Notes.
1.Star Kids are children who are special, advanced and gifted due to genetic intervention by the Star Visitors with their parents’s reproductive material. Star Seeds are grown-up star kids, or adults who have been transformed physically, psychically and consciousness-wise by Star Visitor contact.
2. Although a previous Workshop occurred on October 07, 2000 at Santa Cruz, California led by Dr. Boylan and Barbara Lindsey, that Workshop was focused on young adults (Star Seeds). And the ACCET 2002 Star Seeds/Star Kids Conference held in Berkeley April 6-7 was more of a traditional conference, with experts as speakers and little interactive practice.

Chapter 14
Issues For Siblings, Families and Friends of Star Kids
Star Kids are of course not a free-standing phenomenon, all by themselves. Like other children, Star Kids are embedded in a family-of-origin. Besides their parents and siblings, and these days, often step-parents and step-siblings, the Star Kid also has grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, and even brother- or sister-in-laws. All of these family relationships form a web of connections. Star Kids also operate in a residential neighborhood that provides immediate social contacts. In most neighborhoods children know their immediate neighbors, and even those more distant. Some of these neighbor contacts form relationships of friendship and support. And Star Kids have a wider network of friends, developed at the school they attend, the clubs or sports teams they are members of, through meeting friends of their brothers or sisters, and in other ways. This circle of friends tends to be very important to the Star Kid, but such relationships can also be a challenge. The sum of the Star Kid’s immediate and extended-family relationships, friendly neighbors and school, sports, club and other wider friendships form what has been called a social support network. A brilliant Psychology Professor that I had the privilege of studying with at the University of California, Berkeley, and later at the University of California, Davis, Dr. Marc Pilisuk did important research on the social psychological principle of the Social Support Network. I was part of that research effort for a while. What came out of our research was a core finding that “social support”is a very important factor that makes a significant contribution to a person’s physical health and psychological-emotional health. So powerful is the contribution to physical health that a good thriving social support network is like an on-going immunization shot: it makes the individual more robust and resistant to what would otherwise be the onslaught of disease or illness. A vibrant social support network sometimes even makes the difference about whether a person recovers from a serious illness or goes to his grave. In similar fashion, social support exerts a powerful influence on a person’s mental and emotional health. Clinicians are so aware of this that mental health professionals structure the social support element into psychological treatment programs, such as Day Programs, where patients come in from home to not only do some group therapy together, but also do some projects as a group, perhaps crafts, learning money management, etc. On the other hand, the absence of a good functioning social support system can work to the detriment of a child or adult, even if they are a Star Kid. The negative fall-out from there not being a social support system in place is that the child or older person is more susceptible to physical ailments, and has greater difficulty in recovering from them than would otherwise be the case. Equally relevant are the negative effects on mental and emotional health where the child
173



does not have the social support he or she needs. Social support is not a luxury, or an “extra”. It is a vital part of a person’s essentials for operating as a complete person with a good chance at a physically and mentally healthy life. Given that this is the case, the situation of being a Star Kid presents non-ordinary challenges to the child’s being assured of a good social support network in place. One challenge arises from the situation where the Star Kid finds him or herself embedded in a family, or a neighborhood, or school, etc., where he or she stands out because of their Star Kid brilliance, or their psychic abilities, or their energy-field effects on objects or other people. Nothing sinks the potential of having a good social support network like getting labeled a weird-o, a nut case, “class brain”, a “space geek”, “an alien”, a “witch”, “possessed”, or equivalent terms of social disapproval and exclusion. Most Star Kids welcome and treasure their friends. They are like other children in wanting to have friends, to be friends, to be liked, and to be included in group activities. It hurts a Star Kid like it hurts other youngsters when they are excluded, shunned or called names by those they had hoped to be friends with. Within many nuclear families, the Star Kid is understood and accepted. In some families the child’s “strangeness” is noticed and commented on, but in a friendly way, and sometimes with the admonition that the Star Kid needs to keep his exceptional abilities within the family, and not let other people notice them, because “they wouldn’t understand.” In such basicallysupportive nuclear families, the Star Kid finds the social support she needs to grow strong and healthy. What about the family where the Star Kid is accepted by one parent, but the other parent finds the child’s “strangeness” off-putting? This is particularly sometimes the case where one of the parents is a Star Seed and takes cross-generational pride in his Star Kid offspring. While the other parent is not a Star Seed, is “not too sure about this alien business”, and generally doesn’t want the Star Kid to “act weird” around them. In such a divided home situation, the Star Kid is not going to get the same social support as in a home where all family members are pulling together. To adapt as best as possible to such a household, the Star Kid and/or his Star Seed parent is going to have to take initiative so that the Star Kid gets the love, attention, acceptance and support he needs from the parent who accepts him for all he truly is. What about those situations where the Star Kid finds herself in a family that is totally unaware of the Star Kid phenomenon, or is completely unaccepting of having any abnormality in their household? In such cases the child may have to go outside the nuclear family for the understanding and support she needs, and for being accepted totally for all she is. The child might have the good fortune to have an aunt, a grandparent, or some other extended-family member who has spotted this child for the exceptional being he is, and has taken the initiative to reach out and gently let the Star Kid know that he is recognized, accepted, and welcomed for who he is. In other cases, the Star Kid may have to do the reaching out, tentatively revealing a little bit about herself to first one, then another relative, until she finds the supportive confidante she needs. The neighborhood offers another layer of potentiality for the Star Kid and his need for a social support system. Many Star Kids find in neighbor children the buddies they need. But there are other situations where a neighbor child finds the Star Kid too “weird”. The situation gets compounded if the neighbor kid goes around and spreads the word to other children that the Star Kid is strange. A Star Kid is fortunate if in her neighborhood there is an adult neighbor who understands where the Star Kid is coming from, takes a liking to her, and offers a friendly haven
174



to come and talk and share secrets. School is another major arena in which Star Kids have to function. Rare the Star Kid who does not find a least one chum at school. Star Kids are no dummies, and by the time they have spent a little time in the school social settings, they have usually learned to “dial down” their advanced abilities and even their exceptional intelligence, so that they more or less pass for “normal”. The same generally holds true for sports teams or organizations like Scouts, where the Star Kid may find a friend, particularly if they learn to cool it with the Star Kid talents. The important thing is for the Star Kid to get her social needs met. And sometimes after a strong friendship is forged, the Star Kid can let down her hair a bit further, and let her friend know more about the “real me” inside. The main points to be derived from a consideration of the importance of a social support network in the life of the Star Kid are these. Star Kids should try hardest to forge allies within their immediate family. But the Star Kid needs to be ready to be adaptive. If there is not going to be acceptance of his special identity within the home, then reach out to the extended family. If that doesn’t work out, develop a buddy or two in the neighborhood that the Star Kid can be real with. Also, look to schoolmates for friends and allies. Particular attention should be given to the brightest children in the class. There are more likely to be among them other Star Kids, perhaps also lying low and playing it cool. If the school has a gifted children’s program, give the kids in that program special consideration. There is almost certain to be several Star Kids in a Gifted Children’s Program, if not many. All the Star Kid absolutely needs is one ally. Two or three would be much better. And after that, the more, the merrier. It also really helps if the Star Kid can have a confidante outside his family circle. Not that family aren’t terribly important. It’s just that it helps the Star Kid to calibrate her sense of normalcy better if she can see that other people outside her family in the outer social world also understand and accept the reality of Star Kids.
Letters From Family Members Of a Star Kid
To illustrate the importance of the social support network for a Star Kid, and to show what strains occur when a family member tries to repress a Star Kid, I am presenting here several letters I have received from family members of Star Kids, and in one case, from the Star Seed person herself. After presenting the letter, I include my response to the family member writing, given at the time I received the letter. Since my thinking and understanding has evolved since I received some of these letters, I will also offer additional commentary.
In the first letter an overseas mother proudly writes about her five-year-old daughter, “C”, who is a Star Kid.
[The Mother writes]: “I want to share a little something about my five years old little seed, my beloved “C”, my daughter. “She actually can read people's thoughts, find things you try to hide (especially feelings!), and... She never could stand being held or rocked for more than a few seconds... but she knows
175



very well how to send you bright and warm energy, and to make you feel comfortable. “Many feelings and emotions, for her, seem to flow directly from the "heart" chakra (sorry, don't know its name in English), and from the third eye one (often at the same time, like a double flow of energy) without needing a hug or a physical contact... “Very often she has displayed abilities like making you "look somewhere else" while she was doing something forbidden... And although I am psychic and a Star Kid myself, she often wins the game...! “I can remember very well the first day when I caught her doing this, and I asked : "How did you do it ?," as casually as possible.” "I made you all watch the shrimps on the table, and you did not see me going away through the door," she said. And she laughed, adding : "It is very easy !" “Of course, parents with Star Kids (or indigo kids as some call them) do know of this... But here is a little something else we should think about, and which proves to me that these kids are in need of our VERY special attention and guidance : “One day, as I was cross with her about some little thing she had done, she started staring at me in anger, and... bing, I got this excruciating pain in my forehead, seeing the flow of energy she was sending to me to.... make me feel her anger.” “It took me a few seconds to realise, as I found this so incredible... Then I told her she had no right to use her mind to hurt others, and she blinked, and the pain stopped, and she asked me : "Why ?" (she was four and a half years old) “So, I had to explain that others were not all like her mom or like her, and they would not stand her ways, could become very frightened, and... Could not fight with her this way, which was very unfair to them. "I understand" she said. And she never used this again on me or on anybody else, (well, not on any one in front of me, right ?...) But at the same time, she started not to look at me when she was angry, and this lasted a few months, until she had discovered (well, this is a guess) how not to send her anger directly in other's bodies. “So, I would like you to consider that sometimes, we shall have to be very surprised by our kids, and we shall have to be prepared for this... because they need so much our loving attention, as "having powers" does not mean you know how do deal with them ! “Besides.... Does a child who is so sensitive and efficient need to be taken in your arms to feel your love ? I do not think so... Sometimes, I even get the certitude she would not let me hold her... because she feels my anxiety (even small and "unimportant" to me), and she just tries to protect herself from these feelings. Of course, it does not mean she would never touch me or ask for a hug, hey ? But she chooses her moments, and those always are moments when I am so happy, so "high" in my feelings, like when I have just prayed or worked on some energy with others on our "inner network" around the world (those who are Star Kids or indigos will know what I mean... I hope it will not disturb the others, but I cannot hide this information as I feel it is important to share it.). “To conclude I would say that the "animal" way we often have to show others we love them seems to frighten these "new kids", although it does not prove they are in lack of any love when we don't touch them... say... physically. It seems they have so many other means to stay in contact with their relatives and parents... I believe WE are the ones who should get adapted to this, and maybe we could gain some maturity in our way to display our emotions towards others, so as not to hurt them... “I hope this long post was not boring to read... Along with it I send pink and indigo
176



flowers, not only for those who will "catch them" consciously, but for all of us, as I believe now that we share much more as human beings than we used to think... This is something my "special" kids taught me, and it helped me remember that, as a kid, I really hated to be held by people who were not "happy inside"... “Ah, these grown ups who always think they know better than you do ! :-)
S.
[Dr. Boylan responds]:
“Dear S,
“I think that you have stated succinctly but brilliantly the paradox of dealing with Star Kids Since they are so "sensitive" and telepathic, the crude physical-flesh, "gorilla" ways so many of us humans use to, for example, express affection through bear hugs is just too much for these finely-attuned little beings. “Star Kids differ, but we need to attune to each child’s level of sensitivity and awareness.
- Richard Boylan, Ph.D.
I’d like to offer a little additional commentary on “S’s” letter. I tend to agree with her analysis that the reason her little Star Kid daughter sometimes resists being close or hugged is because this Star Kid is so exquisitely attuned to the emotional vibrations around her that for her own comfort, if not emotional protection, she pushes away from or avoids contact with persons whose emotional state, at least temporarily, is prickly, angry or otherwise unpleasant. I’d also like to comment on the child’s need to be taught morality about the use of Star Seed gifts. Telepathic projection of emotion onto another human being is not necessarily a morally neutral act. In the case of the feisty four-year-old, when she was admonished for causing her mother a headache, she asked why it was wrong. This illustrates that even Star Kids need to learn that they have powerful effects on others, and it is not alright to take advantage of advanced powers to cause pain or suffering in another human being just because you are in a bad mood. Moral development to recognize the rights of others is something that very young Star Kids have to be taught and learn, just as it is true of regular human children.
18-Month-Old Star Kid Grandchild
To: Dr. Richard J. Boylan, Ph.D., LLC
“Hi,
“I've been very interested in the concept of Star Children. My grandson at the age of 18 months started working the children's software on the computer using the mouse. He is now 3
177



and very bright. “I often give him energy with my hands and he will either accept it or push my hands away and state "no, hurt, grandma". “I would like to know how I can help him progress without the restraints of society inhibiting his natural abilities. His parents think that the concept of star children is total nonsense. “Thanks for any help,
N”
[Dr. Boylan replies:]
“Dear Grandma N,
“Good for you for spotting your grandson's advanced abilities. “And I know what you mean about some Star Kids not being able to handle extra energy sent their way. Let me share with you a little story. “A week ago I was working with two Star Kids, 7 and 10. The 7-year-old shaped a ball of energy and used it to read my energetic field. The 10-year-old did an aura scan on me, and noted that I "had progressed to the sixth chakra in energy integration and was about to progress to the seventh." “I wished to signal to these advanced boys that I understood their world. So I offered to send white light energy to the 10-year-old. He politely accepted it for a bit. When I had finished, and asked him how it felt, he replied that it gave him a headache, because he already had enough energy. “Oops! “As for your question about how to help this star kid grandchild when his parents think it's all nonsense, I would say that you have to proceed sensitively. After all, in our society the parents "control the child." A concept not shared in more tribal cultures, to be sure. Given that parameter, there will still be times when you are alone with him and can let him know that you understand and value his abilities. Let him know that there is nothing he knows or is able to do that would put you off. “The real challenge will be as he becomes more aware of differences from other agemates. You can check what awareness he has of contact from elsewhere or origin from elsewhere. You might look at his drawings; they are truly windows into the soul of small children. You might ask in a non-leading manner if he has ever had anyone in his bedroom at night. But you may have to bide your time. “Meanwhile, you can slowly educate his parents by nonchalant comments about various “leaks” on television and in the papers suggesting life on other planets or the reality of UFO presence on Earth. As you "soften up the beachhead" of parental unawareness, it will later be easier to broach the subject of how your grandson came to have his special abilities. “Good luck. - Richard Boylan, Ph.D.
The only additional comment I’d like to make about this lady’s grandchild is that if he was working children’s software at age 1-1/2, I’d like to hire him to work on my computer when
178



he gets a little older!
Letter From the Mother of a Seven-Year-Old Star Kid Rape Victim
The following is what I wrote in response to a heart-wrenching letter written by the mother of a somewhat developmentally-delayed Star Kid girl of seven who was sexually assaulted by a 12-year-old neighborhood bully. I share this, because the world Star Kids have to grow up in is not always pretty. And also because tough situations and issues still provide an opportunity for Star Kid special gifts to be used and make their contribution.
{Mother’s name omitted to protect her and her child’s privacy]
[Dr. Boylan writes:]
“Dear [Star Kid’s mom],
“How terrible! My heart goes out to you, and dear L. I am glad L. is getting counseling.
“From what you say and the newspaper articles, it looks like this is not the 12-year-old perpetrator's first crime, but that he has sexually assaulted her on a previous occasion, and also has physically assaulted a mentally-delayed boy in the neighborhood, too. So, the perpetrator boy has “three strikes”, i.e., is a repeat offender with a bad behavioral pattern established..
“The 12-year-old perpetrator is showing evidence of being a bully and having an incipient sociopathic personality, in that he preys on the weak. Unless he is stopped, he will do it again.
“You can also seek a Restraining Order, restraining the boy's family from allowing him anywhere near your property. If he then should try to come over, he can be arrested for violating a Court Restraining Order, regardless of whether he tries anything.
“Your DA seems to think this is a matter of small children "playing doctor". A twelveyear-old boy in today's world is not a small child, and sexual assault is not "playing doctor". If the DA does not know the difference, he should be recalled from office for gross incompetence.
“As for helping your Star Child cope, the measures of giving her counseling, love and support, and teaching her not to let boys touch her in sexual areas, are the same as for any child in such a situation.
“The extra Star Kid measures can include you, as a Star Seed mother, creating a telepathic connection with L., and, with her permission going inside her head to see how she sees the assault event.
“Another step is to help her to understand that the love and openness a Star Kid seeks to put out to everyone she encounters has to be tempered with some step to psychically "read" the other person, to get a "feeling" about their energy and goodness or badness, before she gets too close to them, and then to conduct herself accordingly.
“In other words, since she is young and slower, she needs to use her Star Kid "radar" on people before she lets her normal people-engagingness flow. People are more strongly attracted
179



to Star Kids. So, Star Kids need to know how to handle the attention directed to them by smiling strangers, and to be taught to recognize that a smile does not always mean someone has friendly feelings for you.
“If I can help L. and you any more, let me know.
“In the light,
“Richard Boylan, Ph.D.
These letters help make clear that Star Kids, now, and when they grow up to be Star Seed adults, do not operate as isolates or detached persons. Fourth-World America has a long tradition of glorifying the Rugged Individualist as hero, be it Ayn Rand’s materialistic Atlas Shrugged, the Lone Ranger, the various “cowboy” solitary heroes played by John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger. Whatever the North American continent will end up calling itself as it transitions into Fifth World, it will need a new set of heroes, who are not ashamed to be, but rather are open about, acknowledging the importance of operating within a social support network that affirms their Star Kid or Star Seed identity.

Chapter 15
The Geopolitical Context In Which Star Kids Must Function
Being a senior (in age) member of the Star Seed community, I’d like first to share the evolution of some of the geopolitical context in which previous generations of Star Kids have had to operate, and then bring things up to the contemporary situation. To the younger Star Kids some of this may seem quaint. But as the philosopher George Santyana noted, “Those who do not learn from the lessons of history are condemned to repeat them.”
Let me start this discussion by telling a little story about what first made me believe in life outside of our own world of planet Earth. I was seven years old in June, 1947, and remember my parents discussing the June 24th evening paper headlines about a pilot who had spotted ships from outer space cruising above Mount Rainier, Washington State. Inspired by their shape and the way they skipped along, he called them “flying saucers”. Needless to say, the name stuck.
Three weeks later my folks were again talking about UFOs. This time they were discussing the July 8th news on the radio about the Army recovering a flying saucer near Roswell, New Mexico. I recall thinking, “That’s neat! There are people out there in outer space, too.” (We the public had not yet been mis-taught by propaganda to fear them.)
And it was in the summer of 1952, when I was in eighth grade, and long since old enough to read the daily paper for myself, that I read the scream headlines, and stared at the dramatic photos in the afternoon newspaper, about UFOs flying over the nation's capital, Washington, DC night after night that summer.
The next year, 1953, the government began the UFO Cover-Up, after the manipulators of the Cabal arranged to have the CIA convene the Robertson Commission. This panel dutifully generated a Report that UFO sightings constituted a “National Security risk” and must be suppressed. But it was too late for those of us who remember all the real news coverage before the news blackout was installed. We know better.
Then in 1972, I had my own UFO sighting in the hills above my house in Marin County, California. There is nothing like personal experience to overcome ten thousand lying press releases from Air Force Public Information Officers. If you can’t believe your own eyes, why should you believe some acne-ed airman lying under orders?
I was lucky. I lived before the UFO Cover-Up, the longest (51 years in 2004 and counting), most extensive (global), most expensive (billions of dollars spent covering up and sequestering information) psychological warfare exercise in the history of the world.
My outlook on UFOs was shaped by real news during the unfettered-press days of 19471952. The UFO Cover-Up, when they started it, was laughable to me and others of my generation. Furthermore, we had enough real information beforehand that we were in a position
181



not to be awed by those lying Air Force Public Information Officers, who handled every UFO report on the radio, (there essentially was no television then), by coming on afterwards and reading a press release that said the sighting mistook a flight of geese, or swamp gas, or the rising planet Venus for a UFO.
But the situation is different for the current generation of Star Kids. Contrariwise, today’s young people have never known a time when the UFO phenomenon was not the object of official ridicule and denial, the butt of comedian jokes, and the subject of endless wacky cartoons. They may not have a point of comparison, but as a person with the comparative historical perspective of a senior citizen, and as a psychologist, I can assure Star Kids that such an intellectuallyhostile climate of denial, ridicule and scorn subtly but powerfully eats away at either your acceptance of UFO/Star Visitor reality, or saps your willingness to get enraged and publicly militate against the patently-obvious, intellectually-shallow UFO Cover-Up.
Since the subject of this chapter is the geopolitical context in which Star Kids must function, let us be clear that the invisible but society-wide bubble of ignoring, denying, and trivializing UFO/Star Visitor reality is an enervating context the Cabal has set up to prolong the years that a Star Kid spends as a “Latent”, unaware and dis-empowered, and to hobble the effectiveness with which Star Kids can function.
This chapter will feature what at first may seem to be a collection of disjointed observations. But be patient. I believe that by the time you get to the end of the chapter, you will see how the clever, devious planners within the Cabal [see below for explanation] have tried to create a context for living in which the saga of Star Visitor contacts with humankind simply disappears from the radar screen.
The next Chapter (16) will deal with precautions Star Kids would do well to observe. The following historical vignette may give today’s Star Kids some insights into both the cleverness and the nefariousness of Cabal operatives in their efforts to harness “useful elements” within humanity to help advance their evil purposes.
The Cabal: A Geoplutocratic “Elite” Bent On Global Domination
“The Cabal", as used around enlightened UFO circles, refers to a claque of global-scale
plutocratic manipulators who use their immense wealth, prestige and power to control governments and economies to perpetuate their stranglehold on global society. This group is comprised of the most selfish, megalomaniacal, and sociopathic individuals, some of whom are big-shots in the Bilderberg Council, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission global policy-making groups. But these groups are not synonymous with The Cabal, since BC, CFR and TLC also contain some well-intentioned individuals.
The Cabal gets a fair amount of mention by me, and, under other names, by other solid researchers, because they are also the rogue group behind the continuation of the unauthorized UFO Cover-Up. Unfortunately, the Cabal has its proxies on some of the seats in the Special Studies Group of the U.S. National Security Council, the group which controls official U.S.
182



government UFO and Star Visitor information and access, and conducts the governmentauthorized UFO Cover-Up..
The unauthorized UFO Cover-Up is to be distinguished from the official governmentauthorized and operated UFO Cover-Up. The unauthorized UFO Cover-Up is conducted by the Cabal, the organization that conducts kidnappings. terrorizing, drugging, and hypnoprogramming of innocent civilians to misrember their ordeals as “alien abductions”. Cabal operatives do wholesale "cattle mutilations", hoping that angry ranchers and terrorized citizens will blame it on "the aliens". The Cabal's operatives also terrorize some UFO researchers who get “too close”, even assassinate a few, (while careful to make it look like an “accident”), and do not hesitate to character-assassinate many more. They hijack some psychotronic weaponry from black-project labs for unauthorized use on their "enemies", or on innocent civilian "guinea pig" test subjects.
In general, most of the horrific stuff done under the UFO Cover-Up comes from the Cabal's unauthorized version of the UFO Cover-Up, often using their plants within military and intelligence organizations (to further camouflage who is at work) to do their dirty work.
The official government-authorized UFO Cover-Up is relatively benign, yet is still morally responsible for the global suffering that could have been averted if the general public had access to clean, non-petroleum energy, psychotronic healing machines, Zero Point Energypowered hydroponic food-growing machines, gravity-shielded superfast airliners and sea freighters, and the immense store of spiritual, metaphysical and scientific knowledge that the Star Visitors wish to share with the people of Earth.
Some remote viewers have seen The Cabal's power broken by 2006. They definitely will be left in the trash bin of history, by the time the transition from Fourth World [current societal mess] to Fifth World [cosmic, just, non-materialistic, peaceable, “extended-family” society] is well established by 2012.
NSA Hybrid Hunts And NASA “Space Kids” Schools
In the 1950s I was a student within one of the most sheltered private high schools in the western United States, an ultraconservative Catholic seminary. Yet even in this isolated womb of non-worldly reactionary existence, we did not escape the tentacles of the National Security Agency (NSA) planners. These NSA types were aware that already the Star Visitors in contact with Earth had facilitated the emergence of the first small crop of Star Kids, and were determined to find out who they were, to track them, and selectively to recruit some of them to come work for government.
One of their identification tools was the Tachistiscope, a seemingly harmless enough device. Its function was to subject students to challenges of reading large paragraphs of text in a few seconds and to retain enough of what was read to correctly answer questions about the paragraphs. This was presented to us naive high school students as a “fun exercise” that “could even speed up your reading with comprehension.” Who could argue with that? As American as the Red, White and Blue. It was never explained how a half-hour exposure to Tachistiscope
183



speed-reading exercises would permanently increase our reading speed. Of course it would not. That was just the “cover story”.
I remember in my college-prep high school around 1954 being tested with my class on a tachtistiscope, a machine which flashed paragraphs of text, one by one, to be read each in
varying minute amounts of time, eventually down to a second or two. We were measured in how fast we could read and retain the basic core content of the paragraphs on the screen.
Then, suddenly, after several days, the machine was no longer around and never mentioned again. No feedback was ever given us of how well we did.
I have asked around and gotten back responses from other people who were young students in those days, and remember well being subjected to these hit-and-run tachistiscope drills as well. I do not hear about those machines in schools now, although “speedreading”courses, possibly inspired by that tachistiscope era, continue today.
I evaluate this quiet nationwide program in the context of NSC scientist Dr. Michael Wolf telling me about his having been spotted as a super-genius child around that time. Plainclothes agents from “the government” (the only identification naive citizens expected in those days) came to his parents, praised young Michael’s remarkable achievements, (which included developing and using his own space-signaling device), and offered his parents an amount of money they couldn’t refuse in exchange for letting the agents take Michael off to be educated and trained, all expenses paid, by “the U.S. Government”. (The agents failed to mention to the parents that Michael would be expected to reciprocate for his fabulous education, which included an MD in Neurology, a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics, a ScD in Computer Science, a JD in Law, an M.S. in Organic Chemistry (electro-magnetic influence on organisms), and a B.S. in Biology (biogenetics), by spending his life working in classified underground laboratories, where he worked shoulder-to-shoulder with Star Visitor scientists.)
This is a benign version of how these government wunderkind “scholarships” go. In other instances, Cabal operatives have either bribed or seduced brilliant young adult Star Seed persons right out of college, or instead of going to college, or out of the military, and gotten them to come work for institutes which are actually doing work for the Cabal. The above is set forth not to frighten the stuffing out of parents of Star Kids, but to provide a cautionary tale about some of the pitfalls which exist, and which constitute another element of the geopolitical context in which Star Kids are expected to function.
Is There Intelligent Life Beyond Earth?
One of the staples of the UFO Cover-Up is to keep mankind on pins-and-needles as to whether there is intelligent life in the universe. Given that U.S. Air Force Generals and elite officials within the U.S. National Security Council have for years been in communication with visiting star beings, for the government to continue the fabrication that they don’t know whether there’s intelligent life out there constitutes “cruel and unusual punishment”. Of course, Star Kids, Star Seeds and experiencers know that there is intelligent life out there, because such intelligent beings have come and visited them!
184



Recently I was asked again for the umpteenth time about this issue. I share the question, and my reply.
Q. “What do you have to say to those who do not believe in life beyond and aliens, and what would you do or say to change their minds about this subject?”
A. “Prominent scientists have calculated that, given the proliferation of the elements of life across the universe, and in so many star systems, and given life's self-organizing principle amidst such abundant building blocks, and given the billions of years available for intelligent life to evolve, that it is statistically certain that abundant intelligent life exists across the cosmos. “Astronomer Frank Drake of the SETI Institute in 1961 worked out a probability formula for life in the universe some years ago. It is called the Drake Equation. Using rather conservative values plugged into Drake’s Equation, the resultant estimate of the number of intelligent civilizations in our (Milky Way) galaxy which are currently evolved to the point of interstellar communication is that there are over 1000 such civilizations in our local galaxy. “Now, the Hubble Telescope has allowed us to estimate that there are 125 billion [that’s a “B”, folks] galaxies, not stars, in the universe. “So, ... putting all that together, there are by best estimate 125 trillion civilizations out there evolved to the point of being capabable of interstellar communication. Needless to say, some good number of these have also evolved to the point of interstellar travel. “We know this to be a fact, not just a conjecture, because at least one hundred such civilizations have made contact with one or more persons on Earth.”
“Why Don’t Aliens Just Land On the White House Lawn?”
Another question I frequently encounter is summarized by the following query. Q. “Why the UFO Cover-Up? Why don’t the Star Visitors just land on the White House lawn and end the cover-up?”
A. “The Star Visitors have not "landed on the White House lawn" for reasons made all too clear in the wise and prescient old sci-fi movie, The Day The Earth Stood Still, (still available in video stores). But the Star Visitors have made formal contact with the leadership of Earth, as was discussed at the original Bilderberg Council meeting in 1954 (Boylan, 1999). And the Visitors encouraged these leaders to get their populations prepared for open contact with the visiting civilizations. Progress by Earth leaders in preparing for disclosure and contact has been less than spectacular, with much foot-dragging. Thus, the Star Visitors have had to take their case directly to the people. In the ensuing decades, Star Visitors have been selecting millions of individuals all over the Earth to make direct contact with, in the expectation that these individuals would spread the word to friends, family, neighbors, and coworkers that the Star Visitors are real, they're here, and they have important things to share. Hundreds of thousands of experiencers have spread the word, in a grass-roots campaign to get word out about the most important story left unreported.
185



Because the individual citizen has not been prepared by their government for Star Visitor contact, the Star Visitors have had to proceed gradually with individuals. Thus, in some cases the Visitors cause the individual to only partially remember an encounter, so that over time, as the rest of the experience comes back, the individual has had time to psychologically adjust to this unfolding cosmic event. When the Star Visitors deal with government leaders, who are used to having earthshaking "bombshell" developments dumped in their laps every day by aides, the Visitors have had less of a need for gradualism in their contact and delivering messages to such leaders. Such challenges come with the job of being a leader on the world stage. Hopefully the world governments will come clean with their peoples over the next couple years, and thus eliminate the need for gradualism and partial obscuring in Star Visitor-human contacts. But do not bet on it. Political cowardice is so epidemic it makes the flu look rare. By way of contrast with the cover-up in industrialized societies, in indigenous traditional societies, such as Lakota, Hopi, (North America), Maori, (Aoroatea/New Zealand), Aborigine, (Australia), Incan, Mayan, (Meso-America), Dogan and Zulu, (Africa), Sammi (Arctic Circle Scandinavia) etc., where oral tradition teaches of origin from, and contact with, people from the stars, subsequent present-time visits by Star Visitors are greeted as familiar, expected and highly privileged events. It will be a wonderful day when the “developed countries” come out from under “the fog of war”, (psychological warfare, that is), and enjoy the same clear understanding of Star Visitor contact that so-called “primitive peoples” already enjoy.
Vatican Monsignor Corrado Balducci Pronounces: "Star Visitors Are Real."
Another piece of the geopolitical context that Star Kids (and adult Star Seeds) must navigate in is position taken on UFO reality and Star Visitor presence by influential countries and other international organizations, such as the Catholic Church. The official posture of these political and quasi-political organizations create powerful influences on the thinking and pointof-view of millions of people. Collectively, such organizational positions constitute the “orthodox thinking” on the subject. Anyone who would challenge such collective positions runs the risk of being considered an extremist or unbalanced. It is therefore a signal event when, amidst the rather solid phalanx of NATO countries’ cover-up of UFO reality, that one of the players, the Catholic Church, breaks ranks with the Cover-Up and instead takes a pro-disclosure and UFO-reality endorsement position. But that is precisely what has been happening over the past few years in Italy. Monsignor Corrado Balducci is official Exorcist for Rome, former diplomat in the Papal Nunciature in Washington, DC, past theologian member of the Vatican’s Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, and an insider who has the attention of the Pope. Balducci has gone on Italian national television five times in the past several years to proclaim that extraterrestrial contact is a real phenomenon! Balducci provided an analysis of the Star Visitors which he feels is consistent with the Catholic Church's understanding of theology. Monsignor Balducci emphasizes that extraterrestrial encounters: "1) are not demonic, 2) they are not due to psychological impairment,
186



3) they are not a case of entity attachment, but 4) these encounters deserve to be studied carefully." Since Monsignor Balducci is a demonology expert, and a consultant to the Vatican , and since the Catholic Church has historically demonized many new phenomena that were poorly understood, his stating that the Church does not censure these encounters is all the more remarkable. Msgr. Balducci revealed to a visiting American professional several years ago that the Vatican is closely following this phenomenon quietly. Since Monsignor Balducci started his Vatican career by serving in the Papal Nunciature (Delegation) in Washington, DC., my informant originally surmised that the Vatican is receiving much information about extraterrestrials and their contacts with humans from its Papal Nunciatures in various countries. But subsequent information clarified that the Monsignor has gotten his cases from other sources. Monsignor Balducci is a member of a group which acts as consultants to the Vatican on various matters concerning humans and spirit or demonic contact. As such, the matter of extraterrestrial encounters could have fallen within their purview. Thus it is significant that the Monsignor instead makes careful distinctions, separating Star Visitor contacts from demonic possession. Indeed he suggests that the Star Visitors are probably more evolved and more spiritual than humankind. Balducci even notes the spiritual significance of the emerging general realization of contact by the Star Visitors, and has written a theological paper about Star Visitors. Parallel information from U.S. National Security Council (NSC) scientist Dr. Michael Wolf , (a member of the NSC’s Special Studies Group tasked with managing the UFO phenomenon), as well as from noted author and Vatican expert Father Malachi Martin, suggests that the Vatican is concerned that it will have a major doctrinal “updating” situation on its hands, when extraterrestrial contact becomes authoritatively acknowledged by world governments over the next several years. Parenthetically, it can be observed that this Vatican insider’s declarations on Italian national television represent technically the first declaration by a tacit representative (Balducci) of a Major Power government (Vatican State), even if "speaking as an individual", that extraterrestrial contact is real and is happening, and deserves serious study. This is functionally equivalent to having a U.S. National Academy of Sciences government scientist go on CBS, NBC and ABC and say that the government has found evidence of extraterrestrial structures on the Moon.
The Time of Transition
A critical piece of the geopolitical context that Star Kids are going to have to operate within is the upcoming “Time of Transition”. This period will be a time of regional major geophysical upheavals, (such as volcanic eruptions, major earthquakes, huge tsunamis, dramatic weather changes, etc.) and social and political turmoil, (such as regional wars, nuclear detonation(s), biological warfare epidemics, massive famines, crop failures, economic crashes, etc.) This period will take place within the next eight years, i.e., before 2012. So, to summarize, we are in for some major rock-and-roll over the rest of this decade. Some of it will be geophysical upheavals; some of it will be societal, financial and militant upheavals. People need to get simple and flexible in their lifestyles and planning, to be prepared
187



to be mobile, to be focused on what the true priorities are, and to be ready to relinquish unnecessary luxuries. “This, too, will pass.” When the Time of Transition starts to unfold, as foreshown by the Star Visitors to experiencers, and handed down in indigenous people's prophecies, there will be a time of destabilization. Dictatorial overreaction by certain governments, including apparently the U.S. Government, will cause many citizens to realize that the government no longer represents legitimate authority, and has lost its legitimation from the "consent of the governed", as the U.S. Declaration of Independence reminds us. Democratic political philosophical doctrine has as its fundamental posit that government derives its authority from the consent of the governed. Once the majority of thoughtful people no longer provide their consent, the Government becomes only an occupying force, and will be dealt with variously by the ingenuity of those who resist tyranny even when it wears a uniform We the people represent an authority, indeed. For convenience and order, we generally cede that authority to elected representatives. But when official government becomes unfaithful to the trust placed in it, as the Declaration of Independence reminds us, it is not only our right but our duty to overthrow it. Is that day coming? If the prophecies and fore-visions of the Time of Transition are as accurate as I believe they are, that day is coming. It appears that Star Seeds and Star Kids may quickly be forming a majority of the population, at least if you count all the “Latent” ones. Many among those Star Seeds and Star Kids are already quite aware that the time is approaching when the official Government will no longer be their friend. And that it is not operating in a way that is legitimate and just. It is in my view that it is a no-brainer that Star Seeds and Star Kids will be among those leading the many citizens who will see through that rottenness; and who will chose to disempower the governmental machine, and set up alternative communities based on common values, goals, and governance by the mutual consent of those governed. Is the above “advocating the violent overthrow of the government”? No, it is not. Star Seeds and Star Kids have morally superior ways to change things that need changing. And as the situation calls for it, Star Kid and adult Star Seed leaders will come to the fore to show a better way to proceed.
Star Visitor Counter-Measures To the UFO Cover-Up
In late 2003, I came into possession of some information from the Star Visitors about past, current and upcoming events. I wish to share a small excerpt, which I feel is timely to share, and for everyone to begin thinking about. This excerpt came from some blue-skinned Visitors with classic Zeta Reticulan appearance of a (to us) large head, large slanted black eyes, and three long-fingered hands. These Star Visitors were involved in the creation of the mega-pyramids in Egypt, long, long before the era of the historic Pharaohs. They used vibrations to create anti-gravity effects in moving the huge blocks of stone, whose weight still exceeds the ability of humans with modern technology to lift. The Star Visitors (as a federation of races in contact) let it be known that they are most displeased with the governments of the (basically Group of Seven) developed countries, who
188



persist in maintaining the UFO Cover-Up despite Star Visitor repeated requests to inform the populace of contact and their presence. The Visitors are even more distressed by the wars and bombings which our supposedlycivilized population persist in. They feel that these problems need to be addressed by them. They have given up on trying any more to convince the major governments to end the UFO Cover-Up. The Visitors have also arrived at the conclusion that their program of going directly to the civilian population by daily series of individual close encounters is proceeding too slowly. They are constrained by the imminence of the date of 2012, when a time-loop for Earth will reach the end of its cycle, and it will be necessary to retrieve some people from the Earth while a new time cycle is being established. 2012 is only eight years away. And at the current pace of individualized close encounters, the entire Earth population will not be reached by that date. The populace of Earth needs to be informed about the Star Visitors, so that they will be psychologically and socially prepared, when it is time for the Visitors to appear openly in a large-scale public way, and when they come to accomplish limited temporary retrievals of certain groups of people from zones at risk. Therefore, the Star Visitors have determined that they will soon adopt a new tactic of public close encounters. This would mean that, for example, whole groups of people, say for example, in a shopping mall, will have the experience of Star Visitor contact simultaneously as a large group, and remember it as such clearly afterwards. Needless to say, before long this will cause the implosion of the UFO Cover-Up. The Visitors indicated that they will initiate this new strategy soon, no later than 2006, but quite possibly sooner. There is more. When the Star Visitors return, many of the population will interpret the luminous humanoid (Pleiadean, Altairean, etc.) Visitors as angels or saints. Further, at a certain point in the foreseeable future, the individuals that have been historically know as Jesus and Mother Mary will return also, along with others also known on Earth as Great Teacher avatars. The churches will have a lot of explaining to do, when supposedly divine or saint figures descend from the sky and step out of starcraft. At that point, the churches’distortion of original messages will become obvious. The Visitors are working with religious leaders to educate and prepare their peoples for this return. But, like the leaders of the civic governments, church leaders generally are too timid to make public declarations to their congregants in the current government-sanctioned climate of cover-up and ridicule. Religious leaders whom the Star Visitors are working with include those of major faiths, and of indigenous spiritualities around the world. The Visitors feel that the religious traditions of love-one's-neighbor are basically helpful, and will provide the proper context for the people's experiencing the mass public return of the Star Visitors, their celestial neighbors. . When all of this information emerges into public consciousness, the people will have a proper mental context for processing large-scale Star Visitor contact. And will have a basis for understanding that public contact is not just be an exercise in interstellar anthropology, but a family reunion. We do indeed live in interesting times

B-2 Stealth bomber as antigravity craft
People frequently ask me why the government persists with the UFO Cover-Up. While I do not in any way endorse any continuance of the UFO Cover-Up for any reason, the following vignette may provide some insight into why the U.S. Government feels it needs to perpetuate the UFO Cover-Up. In 1997, retired Air Force Colonel Donald Ware has passed on to me information from a three-star general he knows who revealed to him (in July of 1997) that "the new LockheedMartin space shuttle [the X-33 VentureStar - National Space Plane] and the B-2 [Stealth bomber] both have electro-gravitic systems on board;" and that " this explains why our 21 Northrup B-2s cost about a billion dollars each." [Electrogravitic is engineer-speak for anti-gravity.] Thus, after taking off conventionally using its jets, the B-2 Bomber can switch to antigravity mode, and, I have heard, fly around the world without refueling. (But such flight range data is also classified, and Col. Ware did not reveal that.) The B-2 apparently has hybrid propulsion and lift technologies, utilizing conventional thrust for public take-offs and landings, but switching to antigravity mode for extended cruising range, for lightning-fast maneuverability, and for shrouding the airframe in invisibility (by having its local counter-gravity field bend light (and perhaps surface-to-air missiles and antiaircraft fire) around the airframe). The ungainliness of the Stealth Bomber is merely temporary, until it moves into antigravity mode, where its independent field propulsion then provides stability. Further commentary, revealing that the government eventually plans to release antigravity technology publicly, is provided by Colonel Ware: “Apparently this highly-controlled military program was used to gain experience with 4th-density technology that may transform civil aviation after all national leaders choose peace.”
Psychotronics: Mental Influencing As Weapons System
While I am sparing in endorsing books in the UFO field, I make an exception for a credible and a definitive work on the difficult topic of mind control. The Mind Controllers, by British researcher Dr. Armen Victorian, (1999) nails the topic. Victorian details the Cold War in mind control as starting from when the West woke up and discovered that the USSR and Soviet satellite states were far advanced in psychic and psychotronic capabilities, and that these had military and intelligence applications and implications. He goes on to cover areas such as: the unethical experimentation like the CIA's notorious MKULTRA experiments on unwitting civilians, the "arms race" in remote viewing, electronic implants to control thinking and emotions, misuse of hypnosis to plant "Manchurian Candidate"like commands for later triggering by remote telepathic or microwave signals, and transmission
190



of spoken words or thoughts by electronic signal directly inside the heads/minds of unaware victims. Victorian describes the major involvement of U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command Colonel John Alexander and other "Aviary" figures in the “diabolical” development and deployment of so-called "non-lethal weapons". Such weapons include high-powered microwaves for "behavior modification" and Very Low Frequency (VLF) acoustic weapons to disable body functions. These weapons systems are used secretly, and covered up by these mind controllers having their operatives go on the Internet to mock and debunk victims' genuine complaints as the "crazy ravings" of "wavies". Star Kids may feel that they have the necessary psychic abilities to detect and to defeat such mind-control efforts. But it cannot but help to know the kinds of mental and psychic tricks that those who make themselves adversaries to Star Kids are willing to use. Furthermore, knowing the range of psychotronic devices out there can enable the astute Star Kid to think about what kinds of counter-measures she would undertake, if she found herself bombarded by one of these device’s energy emissions. The Mind Controllers is a book that will become a classic. And it could serve as “Exhibit A” in the future trials of the domestic psy-war and psi-war criminals who have misused "National Security" cloaking to prey upon innocent civilians, using them as guinea pigs for perfecting their program of world domination through psychotronic control. It may well be that certain Star Kids and their adult counterparts may feel a calling to form groups to do psychic detection (through remote viewing) and interdiction (through telepathic mental influencing) of these perpetrators as the need arises.
Significance of the Birth of Now Nine White Buffalo Calves of Native American Prophecy
A correspondent recently wrote me to ask about the significance of the latest news story about another White Buffalo Calf being born: “Not long ago, within the last two weeks, you posted an article on the birth of the 9th white bull? I'm not sure if I have my facts exactly right? In any case could you explain for those of us not initiated exactly what the meaning of this is? What is the significance?”
To which I answered, “You are referring to the reported birth of a ninth White Buffalo Calf. This is enormously significant to the Plains Indians and others who follow their traditions. Tradition holds that a Pleiadean elder, who appeared as a White Buffalo Calf, and then eventually as a beautiful maiden, was the initial teacher of their culture, science, ceremonies and other knowledge. There was a prophecy that the Return of the Star Nations would be immediately preceded by the birth of a White (not albino) Buffalo Calf. This Calf’s coat would then turn the traditional four colors of the Four Directions: besides white, it would change to yellow, then red, and then black. This is exactly what each of the preceding eight White Buffalo Calves have done over the past decade.
191



“Thus, each of these births severally, and the sum of them even more so, underscored the emphatic arrival of the End Times, when the world-as-we-know-it will pass away, and a new surviving, cleansed world/society/civilization will emerge by 2012.”
The Area 51 Complex as Interstellar Spaceport and Ambassadorial Reception Area
Recent communication exchange with former USAF Airman Charles J. Hall, author of the "Millennial Hospitality" trilogy, coupled with content revealed in his books, brings forth the following interesting revelations. There exists an extraterrestrial race whom Mr. Hall has called the Tall Whites. This race originates from a location near but behind the Arcturus star system. These Tall Whites in adulthood are around six feet in height, and have generally humanoid features. They have blond hair, generally worn short, and the women tend to wear their hair in a feminine form of short cut. They are blue-eyed, and have larger-than-human eyes which wrap part-way around the side of their head. The Tall Whites otherwise look quite human, except that their skin is a chalky-white in color. They have hands with four fingers, the tips of which do not end in finger nails but rather in harder, two-inch-long claw-like appendages. Or it may be that they glue these nails onto their fingertips as a means of protection in the harsh desert environment they stay in while on Earth. The typical clothing of the Tall Whites is an aluminized, chalk-white jump suit of canvaslooking fabric. They also wear gloves of the same material, and an open, white, motorcycle-like helmet. Both the suit and the helmet emit a three-inch-out field of soft-white flourescent light. The intensity of this emitted light can be varied from soft to too bright to look at without strain. These Tall Whites have very high intelligence and an information-processing speed which Mr. Hall estimates at 3-1/2 times faster than bright humans. The Tall Whites's technology is equally advanced. One element of their technology is a transporter suit which they put on which provides personal antigravity levitation and above-ground movement, as well as force-field protection against attacks, e.g., would slow a bullet to where it would fall to the ground. Another element of their technology is their spacecraft. They operate smaller scout ships, which can transport a limited number of individuals. And then they have deep-space vessels that can travel between star systems. Their scout craft is white in color, ellipsoidal or egg-shaped, with a molded flat bottom. It has a row of large windows on each side, sort of like an airplane. Its size is comparable to that of a passenger train's diesel engine, and has two windows in front rather like a train diesel engine. The range of these scout craft permit travel as far as the Moon or even Mars. But not deep space. Their deep-space vessels are very large, sleek, black antigravity craft, 70 feet high, 300 feet wide, and 500 feet long. These vessels also have pilot windows, as well as have regularlyspaced dim running lights along their edges. Their range extends out many light years into space.
192



Their top speed exceeds the speed of light by a considerable margin. Yes, Einstein was wrong about that. The Tall Whites in their interactions with humans often carry stun devices for protection. These eight-inch-long white tubes can emit a microwave beam that can excite the sodium atoms in the nervous system of a threatening human and render the human unconscious for a limited period of time. A contingent of Tall Whites have been resident in the Indian Springs Valley region of central Nevada since before the first Euro-American settlers moved west. Charles Hall concludes that these Tall Whites have found Earth to be a convenient waystation in their travels within this sector of the galaxy. As Hall explains it, Earth's sun is located in the middle of a very large, 10-light-year-diameter almost-empty section of the galaxy. Most stars occur in groups, with another star within two light-months distance. Thus, for civilizations living on star systems near this almost-empty space "bubble", Earth serves as a handy mid-way rest, supply and repair station. The Tall Whites have established a residential location within French Peak, about 25 miles north-northwest of Indian Springs Auxiliary Air Force Station, Nevada. They also have a main base and space vehicle repair facility which is also built into the side of a hill at the north end of Indian Springs Valley, not too many miles from their residential location. When Tall Whites deep-space vessels approach Earth from space, they make an initial landing at Dog Bone Lake, 25 miles east of French Peak on the Nellis Air Force Range, Nevada. Then they make a lateral transition to the Tall Whites’ main hanger, where huge doors part to admit the vessel, then re-close. Presidents (including Lyndon Johnson), select top Senators and Congressmembers, and select Generals and Admirals are aware of, and have actually met Tall Whites, either at carefully-arranged events in Washington, DC, or on the Nellis Air Force Base Range in Nevada The Tall Whites have made arrangements with the U.S. government at the highest levels to have their central-Nevada facilities undisturbed. In exchange they provide advanced scientific and technological information which has permitted rapid advances in science and technology on Earth. Some of their scientists work as technical consultants at advanced laboratory installations, including northern California, Nevada, and elsewhere. The Tall Whites’ main facilities in central Nevada serve as a locale for Visitors from other star system to come and study the English language and American culture. These Visitors are intensely curious about life and customs on Earth. Helen Littrell, along with co-author Jean Bilodeaux, provides parallel and corroborative information in her new book, "Raechel's Eyes" (2000). This book tells the gripping story of how a compassionate Air Force officer on a Perimeter Security Team befriended a Zeta Reticulanhybrid crash survivor, who happened to be a Zeta-human hybrid teenage girl. The book chronicles his subsequent daring experiment, authorized by the National Security Council through the Air Force's Aerospace Technical Information Command, to adopt this hybrid, now dubbed "Raechel", and let her try out living a normal life as a college student at northern California junior college, (disguised as “Lost River College” in the book), while living as a roommate with the author's daughter, Marisa. Her adoptive Colonel "father" was stationed at an Air Force SAC Base in the same city as the college.
193



"Raechel's Eyes" also provides an accurate picture, minus the usual disinformation in such matters, as to what really goes on below the surface of the heretofore undisclosed "Four Corners" base, which is sister to and apparently north of the better-known Area 51 Complex in the central Nevada desert. "Four Corners", (which is misleadingly not anywhere near the real U.S. Southwest Four Corners area), is an undisclosed U.S. Government base. Its function is as a Star Visitor Reception Area and Ambassadorial Interface Facility for visiting representatives from the Intergalactic Council. And it also serves as a cultural integration and tutoring place for those Star Visitors who want to fit in, and be able to walk around and observe Earth while passing for human. This latter effort is called the Humanization Project. “Raechel's Eyes" closely parallels information about the underground activity at Area 51, leaked by Army Command Sergeant-Major Robert Dean, the NSC's Dr. Michael Wolf, former [Area 51] Site S-4 physicist Robert Lazar, and USAF "Project Pounce" head, Colonel Steve Wilson. I believe that all Star Kids and Star Seeds will find the day-to-day struggle of hybrid Raechel, and of the Tall Whites residing at Indian Wells Valley, to try to get accepted in the human world to be an Nth-degree case of the basic struggle so many Star Kids (and Star Seed adults) also experience in trying to define themselves, and be openly who they are without the rejection, ridicule and avoidance too many humans dish out to someone who is different. And “different” can be Zeta-human hybrid, Tall White passing for human with disguise, or a human Star Kid or Star Seed whose advanced abilities "just aren't normal". As "regular" humans learn to accept their own children, the Star Kids, perhaps this will accelerate the day when the public is ready to accept the Zeta-human hybrid "Raechels" and the Tall-White "Harry's" of the galaxy as just other people here to visit. Will we live to see that day? I believe that we shall. For we must. Our time of isolation as “the only known intelligent species in the universe” is over. It is time for us to acknowledge a cosmos-wide Family of Man out there.

Chapter 16
Some Precautions And Protections For Star Kids
This chapter is not going to be too long. Star Kids come equipped with parents or other guardians. These parents love and cherish their Star Kid, and are not about to let anything harm him or her if they can help it. So already Star Kids generally come equipped with robust protection. It is the intent of this chapter to respect such parental protectiveness, and to restrict itself to proving some information and offering some suggestions that are intended to assist the parents in their task of seeing to the well-being of their Star Kids. As alluded to in a previous chapter, parents are not the only ones interested in Star Kids. Their government has taken an interest in such exceptional children for many decades. Attorney Andrew Basiago wrote a report on revelations made by Astronaut Gordon Cooper, (who flew in the early pioneering Mercury and Gemini space flight programs.) Gordie was no wild-eyed radical, but in an interview given four years ago, Cooper laid it on the line, revealing a secret government program that has been going on for fifty years, since shortly after the Roswell Crash, when America entered the Space Age. This secret program, taken over by NASA shortly after its creation in 1958, involved secretly recruiting, analyzing and programming America’s brightest children to determine their suitability for classified projects involving government dealings with Star Visitor representatives and with extraterrestrial technology. Mr. Basiago has generously given me permission to reproduce here his report on what Astronaut Cooper revealed.
Astronaut Reveals NASA Mind Control Program Involving Children
By Andrew D. Basiago Special to Sightings.com (July 20, 2000)
LOS ANGELES -- “Astronaut Gordon Cooper, one of the original seven Mercury astronauts, has confirmed the existence of a mind control program administered by NASA in the 1950's and 1960's involving gifted American school children. “The astronaut's revelation was made during a July 19th interview by host Mike Siegel on the popular, late-night radio program, "Coast to Coast AM." “During a discussion that primarily focused on Cooper's beliefs that extraterrestrial beings are visiting planet Earth and that some UFO's are alien spacecraft, Siegel asked Cooper: "Who were the space kids?" Cooper answered: "The space kids were children with exceptional mental abilities [Star Kids] run through a kind of MK [MKUltra CIA mental programming] program, like the things that are coming out now." He went on to describe how NASA's mind-control program,
195



which emphasized cultivation of the children's psychic abilities, involved such things as telepathy, remote viewing, and out-of-body-experiences (OBE's). “Cooper's remarks generally support the claims of a growing cadre of Americans, now in their thirties, forties, and fifties, [and sixties - Ed.], who are recovering memories of unusual classes that they were enrolled in as children during the advent of the Space Age. These "study groups" included speed reading lessons that enabled students to comprehend entire passages of English prose at a single glance, the use of learning machines to teach them vast amounts of information, advanced memory training, card games and situational exercises involving clairvoyance, and seminars in the guided imagination that forms the basis of "remote viewing." “It is believed that NASA's mind control program was directed at preparing children who would later be able to communicate with the non-human intelligent species that humanity might encounter in space. This thesis is supported by the fact that one experiencer remembers being tutored in a hieroglyphic alphabet that author Fritz Springmeier has identified as a set of "intergalactic symbols" developed by NASA for the purpose of communicating with extraterrestrial civilizations. “The accounts of some individuals suggest that in some cases, the children involved were given drugs to enhance memory and learning, and were physically spun on table top-like devices to induce the altered state of consciousness associated with OBE's [out-of-body experiences]. “Cooper's book, “Leap of Faith”, was released to the public in August, 2000.” [End of Andrew Basiago’s report.]
Given the greater awareness in the UFO and psychic communities about intelligence agencies’ interest in perfecting the psychic arts for spying and stealthy control, it is less likely than before that parents will be persuaded by authoritative strangers saying they are from the government, and promising that their child will be given an all-expenses-paid free education to advanced levels, if only the parents will sign away their child on the dotted line. Nevertheless, other issues of Star Kid safety and protection remain. A fundamental place to start is for the parent of a Star Kid to maintain a non-anxious, gentle overall surveillance of their child’s health, mental state, emotional behavior over time, psychic functioning level, and patterns of whom they communicate with. The parent should also talk to their older Star Kids about informing the parent if anyone triers to get into theor mind while they are asleep. Almost never are children the target of health-eroding microwave or other deleterious directed-energy weapons. Any change in a Star Kid’s health related to outside predation will more likely be due to the stress of dealing with some other avenue of attempted influence. Prevention is of course the place to start. Let your Star Kid know at as early an age as you think appropriate that there are some people out there who do not like children showing that they have psychic abilities. It may damage a little of the child’s innocence, but today’s children need to be aware of potential dangers, and have a strategy for dealing with them. The emphasis here for parents should be not on unduly frightening the child, but rather on empowering the child to “take care of business.” As part of such awareness, the child needs to learn from their parent some basics.
196



One of the first of these basics is who’s allowed to see you “naked. “ Just as a child is taught fairly young that generally it is not a good idea in today’s society to walk down a public street and let everyone see you naked, so also a Star Kid needs to know that it is not a good idea to show your advanced abilities to just anyone. The Star Kid needs to be taught who are the people whom she can act natural around, so that they see her actively using psychic abilities; and when it is time to play it cool and keep such talents in the closet. Generally, close family are okay. The Star Kid’s best friends are a judgment call: the parent would want to know them and their parents before giving the green light. The child’s favorite teacher is more iffy. A parent would want to feel out that teacher’s attitude towards psychic abilities before green-lighting the child’s talking about what she can do to the teacher. Other community members, such as a Scout leader, pastor or medical doctor, would need to be decided on a case-by-case basis. A second strategy is to teach your Star Kid to trust their instincts and feelings. After all, every Star Kid has especially attuned sensitivity and high intuition. Use them. If a person they are with feels open, of clear energy, and relaxed, the child can probably safely first talk about some psychic thing that they have done in the past. After the child sees how the other person reacts to that revelation, then the child can decide if the vibes are right to talk about a recent psychic feat, or even allow an ability to be shown right in front of the person. If the person becomes tense when a psychic ability is talked about or spontaneously shows up, or changes the subject uncomfortably, then the Star Kid should quit. If the person becomes unpleasant or judgmental, the Star Kid can always tell a little white lie and say that they were just kidding, and brush it off. Parents need to be aware of the persons in their Star Kid’s life. Not only teachers but gym coaches, club leaders, youth ministers, etc. Those who spend more time around your Star Kid are going to get to know him well. Sooner or later, an advanced ability your Star Kid has is going to slip out, or manifest spontaneously. A parent needs to keep aware of how these central figures in the child’s life see him. A parent can also “immunize” these figures by telling them that you have noticed that your child is a little special, and that if they ever notice anything unusual about your child, you’d like them to talk to you about it, so that both of you can better understand what is going on with the child. If they bring up “exotic” powers that your child exhibited, think ahead of time of how you’re going to deal with such revelations. Depending on the personality, world view and social or political philosophy of the central figure, a parent is going to need to be prepared to: laugh it off, call such an event a fluke, talk about a show you saw on television about how there seem to be more psychic people around these days, or begin to educate that central figure about the Star Kid phenomenon. A strong way a parent can help protect their Star Kid is to be involved in your children’s life and activities. There is no substitute for your attention and supervision. Such involvement not only makes it unlikely that a risky situation will develop around your Star Kid, but your frequent presence allows you to learn better how your Star Kid is navigating life, and allows you to coach her moves and make sure she doesn’t set herself up to be ostracized, belittled or attacked. Explain to your children why their safety is more important than being polite. Clamming up when some nosy adult is trying to check out if the scuttlebutt on the Star Kid is true, that they can see into the future, may seem impolite, but it is better than the child’s becoming the object of malicious neighborhood gossip, or of unwelcome para-governmental surveillance. If another child
197



begs or dares the Star Kid to do a psychic trick in public, it is not being impolite to protect your right to privacy and say you’re not that much different than anybody else, and change the subject. Another protective measure a parent can do is to be aware of an adult who is paying too much attention to your children. The adult may just be curious and nosy. Or they could be interested in how they might exploit the child. Or they might even be looking for such exceptional children, either as an outreach agent for some agency, or private research group, or even a dark metaphysical society which needs such energy for its rituals. Or they could be scouting out the child for a kidnaping or a child molestation. Most adults pay only brief and fleeting attention to a child. If the adult is unusually fixated on the Star Kid, there is a reason, and the parent needs to find out what it is. And promptly.
Be aware of any changes in your children’s behavior or attitude. These signs are telling you something significant. Find out what it is. Except for that challenging time at the onset of adolescence when pubescent “tweens” want to be left alone and sulk, if your Star Kid suddenly shifts emotional gears, or starts an uncharacteristic new behavior pattern, something is going on. A parent has the right to find out what it is.
Make sure you know where your children are at all times, and whom they are with, and have a pre-agreed time set when they are to be home. While this is good advice for any parent raising a child in today’s world, it is even more important for Star Kids. Sometimes the issue is not your Star Kid hanging with marginal friends and smoking a joint under a bridge. The Star Kid may be being pushed by a best friend to show other kids some aura-reading ability that the best friend knows she has, but which could get the Star Kid in trouble if some other child in the circle runs home and tells their fundamentalist parents, who in turn tell their firebrand pastor who is looking for a new scapegoat to rail against.
A parent needs to teach their young Star Kid that, if somebody tries to take them somewhere, they should run away, and yell or scream that "this person is trying to take me away." It works to scare off child molesters, and it works to dissuade business-suited operatives in black limousines. The Star Kid should be instructed to really make a scene like never before, to run away from danger and yell loudly. It is their one legal opportunity in life to really ham it up and get extreme.
Yet, it is also possible to go too far in seeking to lay a protective shield around your Star Kid. Author Judith Levine, in her wonderful book, Harmful To Minors, (2002) makes the argument that excessive attempts to protect children are worse than ineffectual. It is the global assumption of danger and the exclusive focus on protection that are themselves harmful to minors. We do not need to turn the wonderful young growing generation of Star Kids into a nation of paranoids. We need for these children to be emotionally healthy, balanced, and self-confident, so that hey can take their places in creating a society where paranoia will be a rarity.
Let’s now look at some of the ways in which a Star Kid’s special gifts can provide necessary advance warning as well as protection.
Mental telepathy, intuition and heightened empathic sensitivity are natural allies. If the Star Kid gets vibes or mental impressions from a person that make the Star Kid uncomfortable or leery, don’t wait to find out the hard way whether your impressions were correct. Begin
198



disengaging from the situation as gracefully as possible, but firmly if you must.
If a Star Kid has a precognitive “dream”, or a daytime “flash” vision, about a perilous situation, and then later finds himself in that situation, the Star Kid needs to extract himself as soon as possible, before the foreseen unpleasant event occurs.
Occasionally a threatening situation arises where the Star Kid’s ability to do telepathic mental influencing can come in handy. For example, a jealous bully appears inclined to egg on the Star Kid into a physical confrontation. The Star Kid may choose instead to stay calm, focus very intensely on the bully’s bladder and induce the thought about body sensations, that the bully needs to get to a bathroom very urgently, and “let nature take its course.”
Telekenesis can be a risky power to employ as a protective measure, but in extreme circumstances, it can have its place. If an assailant is chasing the Star Kid, and the Star Kid sends out the psychic energy that the assailant will get one leg in front of the other, trip and fall, oh well, such are “the fortunes of war”.
In extreme situations a Star Kid can undertake to call upon their Star Visitor Guide or Companion/Ally to step in or affect the scene in a way that neutralizes the danger. This is an extreme measure, and Star Visitors are not always available at a moment’s notice. Nor is there any guarantee that their evaluation of the situation, and of the karma involved in an intervention to break up the situation, is going to result in their actually actively intervening.
This was not a fun chapter to write, and it very likely is not a fun chapter to read. No one likes to think about innocent children in danger. It is important to keep perspective, and to realize that every day millions of Star Kids and their families go about their lives without trouble or danger.
The odds of a given Star Kid who takes simple basic precautions actually being hassled or endangered are quite small. Star Kids and their parents should not let a few simple precautions take the joy, wonder and beauty out of living each day in the more complete way that Star Kid gifts make possible. And remember: we are the future. Every day there are more of us. And in numbers there is always strength.

Chapter 17
The Difference Between Star Kids And “Indigo” Or “Crystal” Children
When some people hear about the Star Kids, they ask if that is the same thing as the “Indigo” children or “Crystal” children that some people talk about. No, Star Kids is not interchangeable with these other two labels that float around in some metaphysical circles. It appears that it would be useful to clear up the confusion in some people’s minds between Star Kids and so-called terms “Indigo” or “Crystal” children. Because there are substantial differences. By now the reader is hopefully very clear about who Star Kids are. So, let’s take a look at the “Indigo” and “Crystal” labels that get bantied about.
The “Indigo” label got started by a pair, Lee Carroll and Jan Tober. Lee Carroll is an engineer, who maintained a technical audio business in San Diego, and lives with his wife Pat in Del Mar, California. For the past decade he has claimed to channel an “entity” called Kryon. Jan Tober is a jazz singer who, tiring of road tours, settled in Del Mar, California, and took up painting and metaphysics. Carroll’s “Kryon channelings” caught on in the San Diego County metaphysical circuit. “Kryon” sounds like many other dubious channelings, complete with hokey florid New Age-y elocution, such as, “Greetings, dear ones, I am Kryon of Magnetic Service.” “Kryon” is not afraid to side with Republican foreign policy, a smart marketing idea in heavily-Republican San Diego County. About the tense Middle East situation, “Kryon” blithely notes, “Historians will look back upon the events of this time and say there’s only one country in the world who had the power, the will, and the reason to put a large stick into the Middle East and stir it vigorously. And these historians will say in retrospect that without the placeholder that you call your President, the things that will take place in the Middle East ...would never have happened.” One day Carroll “channeled” Kryon talking about “Indigo” children. Soon, Carroll teamed up with his “spiritual” partner, Jan Tober and co-wrote a book, The Indigo Children (1999). The “Indigo” label is their attempt to describe the new wave of children people are starting to notice now. However, the construct that Carroll and Tober have come up with is disquieting. And by this point in this Star Kids book, you will quickly notice that the “Indigo” label seems to be describing something quite else besides Star Kids. According to Carroll and Tober: “Indigoes”: - come into the world with a feeling of royalty; - come in feeling they deserve to be here and are surprised when others don’t share their sense of entitlement; - have difficulty with authority unless reasons are given and they have choices - will simply not do certain things, like wait in line; - get frustrated with systems that are rote;
200



- seem antisocial unless they are with their own kind; - are not shy about letting people know what they need; - frequently carry an Attention-Deficit (ADD) or Hyperactivity Disorder (HD) diagnosis; - have an indigo-colored aura.
Well, frankly, the above sounds more like a description of a spoiled, willful, distracted, self-centered brat. Whatever the above jumble of descriptors is trying to describe, it certainly is not Star Kids. One call tell that Carroll and Tober, neither of whom have a background in child psychology, nor in experiencer research, are trying to describe some of the new wave of children emerging now. Yes, these new children are quite smart, some have a strong leadership drive, and are impatient with and have difficulty conforming to dysfunctional social structures. And, yes, this causes frustration for their parents and teachers. But no, Star Kids are not little princesses who run around with their nose in the air and feel a false sense of entitlement. And, no, Star Kids don’t feel they deserve to be here. In fact, a number of Star Kids feel that what they deserve is to be back in their home among the stars, and that they are doing hard duty making their way through life on Earth. And, no, Star Kids are not anti-authority; they often feel the best way to deal with authority is to out-reason the less-gifted person who may be holding a position of authority. And, no, all Star Kids are not fidgety brats who have unusual difficulties in staying in line. And, no, Star Kids are not antisocial when they are with non-Star Kids. Star Kids may be more quiet or reserved around regular humans they don’t know. Then again, there are plenty of extrovert, socially-engaging Star Kids. And, no, Star Kids are typically not pushy brats who insist on getting their way. And, no, Star Kids do not generally carry ADD or HD diagnoses, although, as described earlier, a small minority of Star Kids may get mislabeled that way. And, no, all Star Kids do not have predominantly indigo-colored auras. I have specifically asked several psychically-gifted persons about the auras they see on Star Kids, and each agrees that Star Kids come with a variety of size, coloration, and intensity of auras, depending on factors which can change. In 2003 another book came out called The Crystal Children, written by Doreen Virtue, Ph.D. Doreen was attempting to describe the new wave of children who have emerged since 1995. She does not see these children as anything like Tober and Carroll’s “Indigo” typology. I frankly find Dr. Virtue’s eye for the new kids much more accurate. She writes: “The first thing most people notice about Crystal Children is their eyes: large, penetrating, and wise beyond their years. Their eyes lock on and hypnotize you, while you realize your soul is being laid bare for the child to see. ... They are happy, delightful, and forgiving. This generation of new lightworkers, roughly ages 0 through 7, are like no previous generation. Ideal in many ways, they are the pointers for where humanity is headed . . . and it's a good direction! Sure, they may have tantrums occasionally, but these children are largely forgiving and easy-going.”
So, “Crystal Children” is another label attempting to describe the new generation of psychic and sensitive children now being born, describing them as intuitive, telepathic, and possessing “opalescent multi-hued auras”. However, Virtue does not explain why these children
201



are coming in now, why they are different, nor the role of the Star Visitors in shepherding these children in. In my view, the “Indigo” and “Crystal” labels are sincere attempts to describe the markedly different children growing up now among us. However, neither label speaks to the partial star heritage of these children. Such an omission is not trivial. The Star Visitors are a key factor in our past and origin, and their coming return en masse will be an historic element of our near future. The Star Kids are coming in now because the Star Visitors have taken compassion on our situation, and are helping arrange that the young ones being born now include the brightest and best. For all of these reasons it seems right that the best descriptor for them is Star Kids. Any of us can have a heart of compassion for the spoiled, willful, distracted, selfcentered, troubled youngsters that Tober and Carroll seem to be categorizing. Such children and their families need attention, specialized counseling, and compassionate support. But that “Indigo” profile is most assuredly not an accurate description of Star Kids. Star Kids are extremely bright, often in creative and original ways. Some very few also happen to have hyperactivity symptoms, but this may be more due to advanced Star VisitorDNA-based neurological wiring, which does not quite mesh well within a human body (psychomotor system), rather than due to true Hyperactivity Disorder. Star Kids are who they are due to the contribution of Star Visitor genes to their overall predominantly human-partially extraterrestrial genome. Or they are Star Kids because they are reincarnated Star Visitors in human bodies for this lifetime. The “Indigo” and “Crystal” labels, however well-intentioned, simply do not deal with Star Kids’ partial modification and upgrading by the Star Visitors. And such additional information about these new kids is not trivial. Hopefully the above explanation has offered some clarification of the differences between the so-called "Indigo” and “Crystal”-children labels and the genuine Star Kids.
“Star Child” To Be Distinguished From “Star Kids”
Lloyd Pye has been doing some interesting work unearthing anomalous, very large humanoid skulls, which he says establish that there were Star Visitors who resided at least temporarily on Earth many years ago. He labels the owners of the skulls “Star Child(ren)”. That use of the term is quite different than what is meant in this book by Star Kids. Lloyd Pye's "Star Child" is the skull of a fully-extraterrestrial person who resided for a while on Earth, and died and was buried here many long years ago. But Star Kids are contemporary, very much alive, advanced human children who contain only some extraterrestrial genes, which provide the basis for their advanced intelligence, health, psychic abilities, spirituality, cosmic consciousness, etc. Those of you Star Kids who are reading this book know this, being Star Kids yourself. So, while Lloyd's term "Star Child" sounds similar to my term "Star Kid", the meanings are quite different. I salute Lloyd Pye for his separate work documenting long Star Visitor presence on Earth. As we move further through the Transition from Fourth World to Fifth World new culture, there will undoubtedly be further efforts to refine and hone the vocabulary we will be using to describe the many wondrous and spectacular changes that are going on. And I hope that
202



the Star Kids will take a clear leadership hand in clarifying and providing better definition to the new world we are assembling. It will be interesting to see the new Fifth World culture developing, and a whole new vocabulary emerge to describe the new features it will contain. At that point I will gladly, like Joachim of old, utter my “Nunc Dimittis”, hand over the reins to my younger stellar comrades, and exit stage right.

Chapter 18
The New “Fifth World” Society These Star Kids Are Helping Build
Life in the Emerging Fifth World
Like most adolescents, our current society has grown too big for its britches. The culture that we grew up in no longer serves as a guide or context for the possibilities we see around us. The relative calm after World War II ended was shattered by a series of regional wars, made more grim by the ever-looming prospect of the major powers turning the Cold War into a very hot global thermonuclear war. During this same period an explosion of new information has confronted and beckoned us: new findings about our origin as a species, technological advances which allow us to peer into atoms, and to duplicate life in the laboratory, and to see through an orbiting telescope almost to the edge of the universe. The conventional world view of our parents seems quaint and too limited for a society which has photographed every square yard of Earth, which has explored the bottom of the seas, which has traveled beyond the Earth to walk on the Moon, and sent camera satellites to report back to us what Mars, Venus and other worlds look like. Over the past five decades, peoples around the world have been exposed to, and gradually become accustomed to, repeated reports of other-world spacecraft and contacts by the extraterrestrial persons who have arrived on those craft. We are changing our vocabulary to reflect the shift from a national to a global perspective, and from focusing on "the world" to recognizing that our planet is but one of billions capable of supporting life.
All these changes have caused us to outgrow social structures meant to serve an earlier and simpler age: structures such as the nation-state, science as an unchanging body of laws, lifelong career jobs, antiquarian religious forms, the university as the only citadel of knowledge, and a disempowering culture based on looking solely to centers of power and authority for direction. The wild card amidst these other changes is the growing realization by now a majority of the people that we are experiencing frequent flyovers of extraterrestrial spacecraft, and that a substantial number of our fellow citizens have had face-to-face contact with people from the stars.
And all these changes are now compelling us to start asking the right questions about how we should change, and what new social structures we should adopt, as we seek to fashion a Fifth World society and culture.
In April, 1998 a conference was held in Santa Cruz, California, (ET Contact & Points Beyond, April 18, 1998, Pacific Cultural Center). This Conference explored some of these Right Questions. Issues examined there included: "What do we know about Star Visitors/interdimensional beings at this time?", "How do we integrate Star Visitor experiences into our life?", "How will Star Visitor presence affect our social mores and future culture?","How can we place
204



Star Visitor contact into the psychological/metaphysical Big Picture?", "What does Star Visitor contact imply for our psychological/ spiritual evolution?", "Will emerging Star Visitor presence result in a new self-image for humankind?", and "What might be our place be in the greater cosmos?"
These are important issues. To help explore them, I have proposed 24 questions of my own, the answers to which may help delineate where we are going, as we move into a new Fifth World reality. I have provided my answers here. Each of you may wish to formulate your own responses. The sum of everybody's responses will shape what kind of Fifth World society we will build and have.
a) Hypothetical:
Q1: If a large ambassadorial spacecraft landed tomorrow several kilometers outside Geneva, Switzerland, and extraterrestrial ambassadors emerged and insisted on talking promptly with designated representatives for Earth, what should we do?
My answer: The U.N. Secretary-General should be contacted, and he should designate a small team of Ambassadors representing a cross-section of Earth's peoples to meet with the extraterrestrial Ambassadors, and determine what they wish to discuss.
Q2: If the extraterrestrial ambassadorial delegation went on worldwide television via satellite hook-up, and brought out an individual who identified himself as Jesus Christ, looked the part, and worked “miracles” on television, what should be the response of international leaders?
My answer: International leaders should contact the Pope, the Head of the World Council of Churches, the Dalai Lama, the head spiritual advisor of the Lakota Nation, the Rev. Billy Graham, the head Islamic cleric of Suadi Arabia, the ranking spiritual leader of the Hindu faith, the head Rabbi in Jerusalem, and the Russian Orthodox Patriarch, etc., have them form a panel, and go on worldwide television to express each faiths' view of what the return of the Christ figure means. I would anticipate that each would say that true spirituality is unchanging, and that there have been many religious teachers in earth's history, each trying his best to present a path to God. Further, I would expect each to affirm that God uses many intermediaries, and such can include extraterrestrial intermediaries.
b) Philosophical:
Q3: What are the most important philosophical questions to which Star Visitor contact may provide some answers?
My answer: Some of the most important philosophical questions are: Where did we come from? Why are we here? Where are we headed? What is our relationship to people from other worlds? How best can we achieve our full development and purpose here (enlightenment)?
Q4: What do you expect the extraterrestrials will identify as the primary purpose of existence?
My answer: To grow in knowledge, to reach out, to love, and to serve.
205



c) Political:
Q5: Exposure to cosmic cultures is anticipated to alter many humans' perceptions of the importance of traditional nation-state concerns. What is your prediction about the effects of open extraterrestrial contact on political (re-)organization of human society?
My answer: The combined effects of the Star Visitors’ openly manifesting their presence, plus the profound Earth changes overtaking us, will cause a shift from focus on centralized structures of power and wealth, such as the Group of Seven nations, the World Bank and the Trilateral Commission. Instead, peoples will begin to pay allegiance to more meaningful and natural social structures based on regions with common ecological features and lifestyle interests. In the U.S., this may result in political devolution into the Northeast, the South, the Plains, the Northwest and the Southwest, with relatively smaller attention paid to the U.S. as a historical territory.
Q6: Current human society is organized along vertical top-down power lines. Do you expect open extraterrestrial contact to alter the way decision-making is done in our societies?
My answer: Yes. The Star Visitors’ culture, non-materialistic values, style of operating by group telepathic communication and consensus will be contagious. It will reawaken in us a desire to return to governing communities by participatory democracy, as people value once again an ethic of hands-on involvement in making their community work. This will require breaking down large, socially-alienating, unwieldy population centers, such as New York and Los Angeles, into smaller communities.
d) Exo-technology:
Q7: The Star Visitors have extremely-advanced technology, including Zero-Point (Free) Energy systems, inexpensive to operate and totally non-polluting. How will this technology impact Earth society?
My answer: Abundant energy is a key to economic production. When inexpensive Zero-Point Energy systems are made available to all peoples of the Earth, and peoples then have sufficient cheap energy to fashion and distribute raw resources, there will not be one society which will lack the means to provide adequate food, housing, transportation, communications, an appropriate level of technical development, and a gross national product sufficient to afford adequate education and health care for all its people. Since every country has some essential raw materials, each will soon have the means to convert raw materials into finished goods, and no longer need to import many goods. Zero-Point energy means that a country will no longer be rich or poor depending on whether it is sitting on oil or coal deposits or not. Universal Free Energy will go far towards eliminating poverty in what are now called Third World countries.
Q8: How can extraterrestrial technological advances be disseminated widely and fairly to all societies on Earth, and how is this process prioritized?
My answer: The Star Visitors have made it known that they wish to deal with a group which is truly representative of the peoples of Earth. The U.N. possibly may not be up to this standard. The representative group will be expected to see that extraterrestrial knowledge and technology are distributed fairly to all peoples, without the favoritism and priorities which historically have been accorded to the rich and powerful nations of the Earth. It will be a humbling but salutary
206



experience for the NATO countries to find out that they do not necessarily go first, nor get more than their share of these resources.
e) Current Situation:
Q9: How prepared are the peoples of Earth for global authoritative declaration of extraterrestrial contact and open demonstrations of their presence? What can enhance that preparedness?
My answer: Most countries of the world do not experience the massive, powerful and wellorganized UFO Cover-Up which is prevalent in the U.S., the UK, and to a lesser degree in other NATO countries. Thus, most citizens of the world have heard of numerous UFO and ET contact reports without official ridicule. Most of these peoples are ready to accept formal open Star Visitor contact. The small minority who are not prepared are those who have fallen victim to propaganda put out by religious or secular authorities who fear that their power base will be eroded by the open presence of advanced extraterrestrial cultures. Even in the tightly-controlled U.S., public opinion polls show that a solid majority of the population believe that UFOs are real, and that the government is covering up something about UFOs.
The people's preparedness for open extraterrestrial presence will be hastened by accelerating a process which has already begun: having authoritative figures, such as former military and intelligence officers and government scientists, go public with their personal knowledge and experience with UFOs and Star Visitors.
Q10: Who/Which types of leaders/spokespersons should take on primary initiative to make authoritative declarations about Star Visitor contact and presence?
My answer: This leadership in making disclosures should come from a cross-section of the most respected public figures in various occupations: scientists, religious leaders, government officials, movie and radio celebrities, noted professors, respected news anchors, philosophers, artists, and physicians. Their manner should be calm, informative, accepting, optimistic and reassuring.
f) Situation-Improvement:
Q11: What are the most effective ways to quickly erase the accumulated decades of public conditioning that UFOs and Star Visitors are imaginary, or kooky thinking?
My answer: The same instrumentality that created the problem in the first place. The government, through its intelligence agencies and their Public Acclimation Project, has already for several years been engineering more and more serious media coverage of UFOs and Star Visitor encounters. What has been missing, and what needs to take place right now, is to start having a string of celebrities come forward, of the stature of an Oprah Winfrey or a Paul Harvey, announcing their UFO sighting or extraterrestrial encounter.
Q12: Which kinds of public figures can most effectively ease worries about whether the Star Visitors represent a threat?
My answer: People will respond most strongly to assurances from top military officials such as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, renown religious leaders such as the Dalai Lama or the
207



Pope, and internationally-respected diplomats such as former President Jimmy Carter.
g) Human History:
Q13: Some Star Visitors have communicated to some experiencers that the Star Visitors are responsible for genetically engineering Homo Sapiens. What will the public's reaction be to information that we are partially the product of Star Visitor bioengineering?
My answer: Most educated people are aware that archeologists had discovered a puzzling gap, a “Missing Link”, in human evolution. And currently there are debates across society between Creationists and Evolutionists. This creates an opportunity. Extraterrestrial intervention in primate evolution to accelerate the development of an intelligent species on Earth provides the answer to the Missing Link. And extraterrestrial intervention in our evolution means that both those who oppose evolution and evolution proponents are partly correct. The public should handle this information adequately, if presented calmly by authoritative scientists, religious leaders and philosophers as new information, but which does not undermine our dignity or life purpose.
Q14: There are some indications, from both human archeological and Star Visitor sources, that extraterrestrials have intervened in human societies regularly over the millennia, and have effected major advances in cultures. What will the public's reaction be to information that our cultures are partially the product of Star Visitor seeding of information?
My answer: Just as human authoritative spokespersons can calmly present new information about a Star Visitors role in human evolution, so these authorities can present additional information about how Star Visitors have provided limited but important information at various times to help Earth cultures advance.
h) Spiritual/Religious:
Q15: Some indigenous spiritual leaders (on Earth) are saying that Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tse, Krishna, White Buffalo Calf Woman, Quetzocoatl and other major figures of world religions were Star People (extraterrestrials, or humans heavily influenced by Star Visitor consciousness). How do you foresee various human groups reacting to Star Visitor information confirming their role in shaping world religions?
My answer: A key critical element in assisting religious people of Earth to understand extraterrestrial influence in the original development of world religions is to understand the spiritual nature of the extraterrestrials themselves. As Vatican Curia member Monsignor Corrado Balducci has publicly stated on Italian television repeatedly, the extraterrestrials are persons, have souls, and are probably more spiritually advanced than humans are. The Star Visitor influence on the thinking and teachings of the world religions' founders should therefore be seen as a sharing of their more developed spiritual perspective with our more primitive and struggling ancestors, and not as manipulation or trickery. When we teach our children about spirituality, we do not start with advanced graduate theology. We start where we find the child, and help him/her develop and refine their innate spiritual nature. We should not be surprised if these altruistic Star Visitors went about the project in similar fashion.
Q16: What responsible role can current leaders of world religions take, to deal with the
208



impact of revelations about Star Visitor influence on earlier man's spiritual culture?
My answer: Current religious leaders can follow the initiative begun by the Vatican, when they allowed Monsignor Balducci to make trial-balloon statements about Star Visitor reality and spirituality. Just as the Catholic Church needs to follow up on these beginning statements with more official declarations by the Pope, so other world religions need to begin the process of acclimating their followers to the fact that spiritual knowledge is not just invented each generation, but is also handed down from elders; and that some of humanity's religious understandings were handed down from nonhuman elders.
i) Infrastructure:
Q17: There will be great pressure on human society to rapidly adopt the Star Visitors’ many advanced devices, sciences and technology. Yet worldwide there is not enough money to adequately maintain existing infrastructure (roads, transportation, utilities, schools, etc.). How should we recommend that resources be allocated?
My answer: With the fair and equitable distribution of Star Visitor technology, especially including Free-Energy (ZPE) devices, to all peoples of the Earth, as mentioned earlier, all peoples will be able to afford and have the basic elements of a civilized life without polluting the Earth. Remaining differences in various societies will result from different cultural emphases on how much effort to put into producing elaborate material goods versus emphases on mental, spiritual or artistic development. There will still be some human cultural diversity, but not the grinding poverty currently plaguing so much of Earth’s population.
Q18: Does the emergence soon into the open of extraterrestrial science and technology mean that human society can restructure to live in ecological harmony with the Earth while still having a high culture?
My answer: Yes. With Free Energy, and the inspiration of the Star Visitors’ non-polluting technologies, there is no reason why Earth cannot advance to a more sophisticated and pollutionfree society.
j) Global Economics:
Q19: A significant number among the ultrawealthy elite fear that open contact with Star Visitor cultures will lead to collapse of traditional financial systems, the devaluation of many traditional stores of value (oil, uranium, coal, utility stocks, etc.), and even the loss of the psychological drive to accumulate ever-increasing wealth. Is that likely? Is that bad? What is your considered view?
My answer: The plutocratic oligarchy, who control the Earth through such structures as the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations and the Bilderberg Society, have good reason to fear that their unjust and obscene concentration of the world's wealth into the hands of the few is about to come to an end. The Star Visitors’ emphasis on mental and spiritual development, rather than on technology and materialism, and the Visitors’ ethic of service to others, will seriously challenge the current so-called world order, which is based on a few living lavishly and arrogantly, while the majority of the Earth lack adequate food, health services and economic security. Faced with the choice, most on Earth will opt to end the concentration of
209



Earth's resources in the hands of the privileged oligarchy. Such an economic and social revolution is long overdue. If the Star Visitors’ visits serve as such an inspiration, so be it.
Q20: If open contact with the highly-communitarian Star Visitor societies leads to economic reorganization of human society, which direction do you think such reorganization will go? Should go?
My answer: As we begin to experience, and then incorporate, social telepathic communication with the Star Visitors among us, and then with each other, we will refashion our societies into more open, trusting, familiar networks. Deceit and evil intentions will have nowhere to hide, and will soon disappear, in a community where everyone can know what the others around them are really thinking. Familiarity breeds stronger bonds, and is a more socially-leveling influence.
k) Military/Security:
Q21: The Star Visitor presence means the theoretical availability of advanced Star Visitor allies with technology to interdict and stop any general military attack between countries on Earth. Should the peoples of Earth therefore dismantle their standing armies, except for a small, National Guard-level force to quell any potential civil unrest?
My answer: Yes. We need to evolve now past the primitive stage of having large standing armies ready to attack on another. In the face of Star Visitor contact, we need to give up our petty wars as ridiculous, and declare universal peace all over the Earth. Most wars are economic or territorial. Star Visitor technology will provide a basis for a world without want. As Earth is soon permitted to become a space-faring society, the urge to expand and explore the universe will be all the challenge any adventurer could want. A modest-sized internal policing force should therefore be sufficient for any country.
Q22: The Star Visitor’s Intergalactic Federation has communicated to us through experiencers the message that we humans need to give up our nuclear and Star Wars weapons if we wish to be permitted to become a space-faring society. Should we comply with that condition? What can our leaders do to prepare their peoples for these circumstances?
My answer: The authorities need to steer a middle course which avoids leaving us sticking our heads in the sand and creating massive panic. Such a middle course involves the honest sharing of warning information about upcoming crises and cataclysms as it becomes known. Information is power. Rather than worrying about the effect of warnings on the stock market, leaders should focus on their duty to provide timely information, and to have public agencies and services prepared for all foreseeable circumstances. There should be public education campaigns about how to conduct oneself in earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, stock market crashes, urban riots, etc.
Q24: What kind of Post-Star Visitor Contact human society do you want to see constructed?
A society which is a collection of real communities built on trust, mutual caring, an ethic of service to others, and shared values; a society which is grown up enough to welcome oddlooking visitors from far away and spend time getting to know them; a society which values the things of mind, heart and spirit more than bank accounts and country club membership; a society which has learned to live as much in harmony with the Earth as our Native American ancestors
210



did, who have left not a single negative environmental impact; a society which is ready to reach out to the stars and expand our definition of what is “home”.
Star Kids’ Roles In Establishing the New Fifth World
Above we have taken a look at the shock-points contemporary society will have to go through as the old order ends, and the new Fifth World cosmic culture is established. Star Kids will have an important role in the fashioning of that new culture.
Practice for functioning in Fifth World cosmic society will happen during the Transition. For example, numerous experiencers have been shown scenes by the Star Visitors, similar to scenes psychics have foreseen, where the customary resources of society will break down. It will no longer be possible for everyone to just get carted off to the hospital by an ambulance when you get seriously hurt. At that point the psychic healing powers Star Kids (and Star Seeds) have are going to be critical As Star Kids jump into the gap in services, they will begin to establish a culture of layman local healers who can deal with a situation at the site where it occurs. I have had a couple of personal experiences with non-ordinary healing. Albeit it was done by the Star Visitors, and not by a Star Kid or Star Seed,. Still, in the latter instance, a Star Seed brought in the Star Visitor to do the healing. It appears likely that some of the advanced functioning that will go in in Fifth World society will be the combined effort of joint partnerships between a Star Kid and a Star Visitor.
I know that it was the almost-instantaneous knee-repair the Star Visitors did on me several years ago, while my wife and I were “switched off” and suspended in the air in our car over a thousand-foot gorge, before they finished and positioned our car on the road on the other side of the chasm, as a kind of “calling card” cue, to let us know what had happened and who was responsible, after my doctor had given up and said I'd “just have to learn to live with it,” that convinced me of their abilities. And then there was the truly instantaneous healing of a chronic, painful sciatica injury, which again the doctor had no cure for, and which the Star Visitor Neuman effected on me while I was fully conscious and visiting his primary contact person, psychic Marian MacNeil, CHT, (Secretary-Treasurer of the Star Kids Project, Ltd.), in her home/office. The Visitors' results speak for themselves. These cures have persuaded me that the Star Visitors have amazing healing abilities of which we can only imagine. So, clearly the Star Visitors have abilities to refashion a selected human's physiology, (likely through manipulation of human bioelectric and auric fields, as well as their genetic and vibrational techniques). Their success, and their involvement with the Star Kid transformations that result in Star Kids and adult Star Seeds, provide an understanding that these transformed Star Kids and Star Seeds do indeed possess a number of advanced psychic properties and abilities, and furthermore, that the Star Kids stand ready to use them. Can you imagine a world where millions of kids and millions of adults exist as a resource spread among the population, equipped with the dizzying array of powers and gifts enumerated in the Star Kid/Star Seed Identification Questionnaire? (See Appendix A.)
211



University Professors Report Over 50 Million “Cultural Creatives” Remaking Society
Sometimes Star Kids and Star Seeds feel that we are just an unnoticed band of eccentrics ghetto-ized within the larger clueless society. And then something comes along that can tell us that the revolution not only is happening, but it is getting noticed by the larger conventional society. Such an event is the emergence in 2001 of a book reporting the findings of a 12-year study by two university professors on a sea change going on within society. The Cultural
Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World (2001), written by Professors Paul Ray and Sherry Anderson, reports that a radically different culture is emerging in the U.S. These Cultural Creatives reject prevailing mainstream materialistic society. The Creatives see themselves as citizens of the world, are altruistic, idealistic but practical, are environmentally conscious, concerned about those society has neglected, and are activists. The Cultural Creatives emerged in the 1960s, and represented about 5% of the American population. This was the Hip Generation, and, as noted in an earlier chapter of Star Kids, was the time when the percentage of Star Kids and Star Seeds was starting to rise noticeably within the general population. (Drs. Ray and Anderson do not discuss Star Seeds as such in their analysis.) Now the Cultural Creatives constitute over a quarter of the population! These creative, optimistic, cutting-edge types are creating deep cultural change, for example insisting that business practices change to create real environmental sustainability. Ray and Ansderson state that “we are in the middle of a transitional phase...” and “have arrived at a crucial point where things could change extremely quickly.... We are on the verge of an unknown world, ... we are going to have to cast aside our habitual reference points in order to build a new culture.” Although they may not recognize it, the professors are talking about the Star Kids, and the former Star Kids who are now grown Star Seeds, and are taking roles within society where they push for positive change, transforming current Fourth World society into the new Fifth World society. Ray and Anderson identify the inner resources that are empowering these Cultural Creatives to make such changes. “It’s only a matter of having moral imagination and an inner heart-felt wisdom.” The authors describe to a “T” the tidal wave swelling within society globally, as more and more Star Kids come of age and become fully-active participants in society. We know that, as the Hopi Prophecy warned, the current Fourth World society has fallen into the fatal flaws of the three previous Worlds that went down to destruction: this Fourth World is forgetting the Oneness of all creation, sinking into greed and materialism, and engaging in promiscuity and aerial mass warfare. Who can save future generations from this madness? Who can apply their intelligence, pure-heartedness, wisdom, selfless caring, collective consciousness, dedication, humility, bravery, relentlessness, psychic gifts, and the way of the gentle warrior to compel the necessary changes to happen. You know the answer by now. It is the Star Kids. If you are a Star Kid, let this book light a fire under you. Let it make you aware that you are not alone. Let it encourage you in the knowledge that there are millions and millions of other Star Kids out there, some “Latents” right now, to be sure, but millions more who are Turned On and are ready for action!
212



Do you imagine that there is any force on Earth that can stop this revolution? That can blunt this tidal wave? No, there is not. When even establishment university professors note and document the size and potency of this tsunami of culturally-creative Star Kids, you know that the Cabal has to know that the jig is up. Fifth World is coming in fast and hard. It will be in place by 2012. And it will be beautiful to behold, to walk around in, and to be a part of. It is a good time to be alive.

Answer to the above question:
They each have the energy signature of being a Star Seed. Note, this does not mean that they are all now aware of contact or star heritage, but some are. Others are what may be called "Star Seed Latents": persons who have Star Seed heritage, and are aware in some way that they are different than many of their contemporaries, but have not yet arrived at a full understanding of why. Yet some of them clearly are aware of their advanced psychic abilities, and of the reality of Star Visitor contact, and more. Again, as was noted with celebrity Star Kids, the point is not that we should all want to be a celebrity. But these Star Seeds have used their abilities to distinguish themselves in the world. And in ways that do not always come to public attention, many of these Star Seeds are using their high abilities to make a difference for the good of the world. We all need heroes, and people we can try to model ourselves on. Among these figures almost everyone can find such a hero or model. As we enjoy knowing something special about these people, let us remain clear in our focus that we share a generous helping of the same stream of energy. And it will be exciting to see how each of us uses that personal stream of energy to distinguish our life as having made a difference for good in the world. Think of how each of these has made an impact on the world. How many Star Kids are going to grow up and make an even greater impact on the world?

The child, without any coaching, has a natural affinity for correctly using crystals, energetic stones, or other power objects to amplify psi energy, e.g., for healing
218



purposes. = 1 50. The child has complained about wanting to “go home” elsewhere and feeling alienated from the coarseness of Earth society and typical human behaviors. = 1 51. The child is strongly drawn to other Star Kids, and they, too are also strongly drawn to and feel an affinity with the child as a Star Kid. = 1 52. Score only ONE of the following two Sub-Questions [(a) or (b)]: a). The child does exceptionally well in school, easily mastering subjects without much or any study, is bored with the pace of instruction in most schools, and is comfortable in a learning environment well ahead of his age, (e.g., an elementary student taking high school classes, a high schooler doing college or graduate work, or a child bored in a Gifted School;) = 1[or] (b). The child is misunderstood by the school system, mislabeled “Attention Deficit Disorder” or “Learning Disability” (because s/he is bored, underchallenged, or put off by the “normal” children’s learning pace); or mislabeled “Hyperactivity Disorder” (because of fidgetiness in the classroom out of boredom, or because of their thoughts directed to more challenging subjects, or because the child is highly focused on a topic of interest and perseveres much longer than is considered “normal”); or mislabeled “Learning Disabled” (because s/he sees and points out the connections between the subject being taught and other subjects, (such as history-math-science-art connections) when the teacher only wants to hear about the one subject being taught.) = 1 53. The child has experienced a “Walk-In” or replacement of the original human (dying) personality by a new (off-world) personality, which takes on the existing body and continues the life, having memory of earlier years but with different abilities and personality = 1 54. The child has an unusually large bioelectric field extending outward from their body, (e.g., over 6 feet [1.83 meters]), as measured by dowsing rods. = 1 <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><> If the child (or adult) scores 12 or above, please suggest to the parent that they contact Dr. Richard Boylan, Director, Star Kids Project, Ltd about further information available on Star Kids or Star Seeds, and about a Workshop for them, families and friends, so that they can better understand the phenomenon, grow more comfortable with their advanced abilities, meet other Star Kids and families, and clarify their Star Kid/Star Seed mission.

<><><><><><><><><><> There is a second way to detect a Star Kid. The bio-electromagnetic-photic field around a Star Kid extends much farther out than on a regular human, and can be detected by the use of dowsing rods, as mentioned in Chapter Two. <><><><><><><><><><> A third way to detect a Star Kid is to look for the aura around the child’s head and shoulders. If it is barely detectable, or only extends out a fraction of an inch from their body, the child in question is probably a regular human. But if the aura is really clear and extends a couple

In almost all such cases the child is a Star Kid. <><><><><><><><><><> You can also use any number of the determining advanced attributes enumerated in the Star Kid Identification Questionnaire to help figure out if a given child is a Star Kid. Since there are so many, they will not be repeated here. Remember, when you find that another child is a Star Kid, treat them the way that you would like to be treated. Don’t point at them and make them feel awkward. Smile and greet them warmly. After all, the Star Kid is part of your cosmic extended family.

Star Kid Workshops
Most Star Kids will find great benefit from participating in a Star Kids/Star Seeds Workshop, where he or she will have a chance to meet other Star Seeds and Star Kids, develop their abilities, learn more about why they’re here now, and their mission in life. The next one will be announced in the not-too-distant future. Watch Dr. Boylan’s website’s Announcements Section, or subscribe free to his DrRichBoylanReports email list. (Details about how to do so are below.) You can help bring a Star Kids Workshop to your area. Do you know any other Star Seed adults and Star Kids in your area? If 15 or more Star Kids and their parents (and additional Star Seed adults if you want) can be identified as interested in participating in a Star Kids/Star Seeds Workshop, Dr. Boylan and Star Kids Project staff can come there and hold a Star Kids Workshop.
