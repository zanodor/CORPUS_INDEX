Lungzubel which means "Stone rice beer containers or jars" in the Biate language are stone relics found in the southwestern part of Dima Hasao district in Assam and its surrounding areas extending to the neighboring state of Meghalaya.
The literal meaning of Lungzubel are – 'Lung' means Stone, 'Zu' means Rice beer and 'Bel'
means Jar, which comes together as “Stone Rice Beer Jar”.

Lungzubels in Saipung, Meghalaya
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungzubel
Just in March, a team from the directorate identified and documented a site in Dima Hasao district where about 58 monolithic stone jars, some of them either broken or partially damaged, were found.
"This was a significant discovery as the stone jar burial site, known as Lungmailai, had remained unreported till we visited the area in March this year. We also discovered a unique megalithic site near Khobak (in Umrangso) near the Meghalaya border. About 86 stones across three clusters were found scattered at the site," Nabajit Deori, technical officer of the directorate, said.

The Directorate has conducted extensive exploration in Dima Hasao District of Assam with proper recommendation from the Govt of Assam and license from the Archaeological survey of India. The exploration in the District yielded few numbers of new Archaeological sites like Megalithic site at Khobak, Bolsan stone jar site, stone jars at Lungphuiphai for the field season 2016-17.

Abstract The megalithic jar sites of Laos (often referred to as the Plain of Jars) remain one of
Southeast Asia’s most mysterious and least understood archaeological cultures. The sites,
recently inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage, host hollowed stone jars, up to three metres in height, which appear scattered across the landscape, alone or clustered in groups of up to more than 400. Until now, it has not been possible to estimate when the jars were first placed on the landscape or from where the stone was sourced. Geochronological analysis using the age of detrital zircons demonstrates a likely quarry source for one of the largest megalithic jar sites. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating suggests the jars were positioned at the sites potentially as early as the late second millennium BC. Radiocarbon dating of skeletal remains and charcoal samples places mortuary activity around the jars from the 9-13th century AD, suggesting the sites have maintained ritual significance from the period of their initial placement until historic times.

Abstract
Stone jars are a unique archaeological phenomenon in Assam, India, with similar features
also present in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Indonesia. Sites in Assam were
first noted in the early twentieth century, with systematic recording not commencing until 2014 by a collaborative effort from the North-Eastern Hill University, Nagaland University and the Archaeological Survey of India. In a continuation of this effort, this paper presents the results of a 2020 survey across Dima Hasao Province, Assam, India which led to the documentation of four previously unreported megalithic jar sites, growing the number from seven to eleven known jar sites, with ten geolocated. In addition, a general discussion of the known jar sites to date is conducted regarding distribution and jar characteristics.

Multi-periodSite Name: The Plain of Jars Alternative Name: Ban Ang, Site No. 1 Country: Laos Type: Ancient Mine, Quarry or other Industry Nearest Town: Phonsavan Latitude: 19.333300N Longitude: 103.366700E
The Plain of Jars is famous for its huge stone vessels, ranging in height from 1.5 to three metres tall, These remarkable stone receptacles can occur individually, or in groups running to several hundred. While the most-famous set was arranged on the plain (hence the name), most jars can be found perched on ridges and hills, with some still shrouded by forest. All the signs are that these vessels were associated with funerary activity, but the communities responsible for them remain mysterious.
The breeze is cool and redolent of mountain pine. The landscape verdant and vast, a series of rolling hills stretching all the way to the horizons. If it weren't for the paddy fields, a sea of sun-ripened sheaves of grain swaying gently in the wind, one could be forgiven for thinking one was on an upland meadow somewhere in New Zealand. Then one notices women wearing brightly coloured pa sin (tubular sarongs) and small herds of water buffalo grazing here and there and one remembers that one is actually in the Lao People's Democratic Republic.
Welcome to a particularly remote corner of this landlocked country, to the northeastern province of Xiang Khouang, where such bucolic scenes of plenty are commonplace. Located as it is at an elevation of around 1,000 metres above sea level, the weather here is never oppressively hot, the smiling locals never in too much of a hurry to stop and chat.
But tourists come here neither for the picture-postcard views nor for the idyllic temperatures. And most stay only for as long as it takes to get a good look at the ancient stone jars scattered in great numbers across this plateau. For we are - you've guessed correctly - on the Plain of

Jars, famous for huge stone vessels, ranging in height from 1.5 to three metres, whose original purpose remains a mystery to this day.
According to one local legend these enormous receptacles were hollowed from blocks of stone in order to ferment an alcoholic concoction for consumption at the mass celebration of a great military victory thousands of years ago. Once upon a time (the story goes), there lived an evil king called Chao Angka who oppressed his subjects so terribly that they appealed to Khun Jeuang, a good-natured monarch who reigned to the north, to come and liberate them. In the great battle that ensued, Khun Jeuang's army defeated the forces of Chao Angka and then marked their success with an orgy of drinking. And it must have been some session indeed, since one of these vessels could probably hold enough liquor to get an entire village intoxicated!
Archaeologists have come up with a more sober theory - but no supporting evidence, alas - to the effect that the jars are actually coffins, perhaps as much as 2,000 years old. Which would make them one of the oldest archeological finds in Southeast Asia, artefacts that have survived the attention of looters, the ravages of time and the elements and countless American bombs.
Some seven kilometres from Phonsavan, the provincial capital, lies the principal jar site. Known as Ban Ang or sometimes simply as Site No. 1, it contains more than 300 of these gargantuan vessels. The other two main sites are only a few kilometres away.
During the so-called Secret War, waged from 1953 to 1975 by the US and its allies, some 580,000 bombing raids were flown over Laos, dropping in excess of two tons of high explosive for every man, woman and child resident in the country at that time. Cluster bombs, rockets, artillery shells and anti-aircraft rounds rained down on more than 87,000 square kilometres of this tiny country. Falling on bogs, waterlogged rice fields and forests, nearly a third of these failed to detonate, but this UXO (unexploded ordnance) continues to kill and maim hundreds of unwary people each year.
So roaming at will around the Plain of Jars is not recommended. Take a stroll around the streets of Phonsavan, though, and you'll see plenty of recycled bomb casings put to a variety of ingenious uses. More glaring evidence of the war can be seen in the town of Khoun, some 30km away, where the damage to the principal Buddha image and ubosot at Wat Phia remains unrepaired.
Forgotten for many decades amid the chaos and conflict which swept this remote corner of Laos, Xiang Khouang is today welcoming tourists back to view its unique mix of natural and man-made wonders.
